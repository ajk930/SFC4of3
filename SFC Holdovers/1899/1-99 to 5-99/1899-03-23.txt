THE POPE GROWS
VERY DESPONDENT
Says Rejoicing at Recovery Is Mockery
When He Will Not Live a
Week.
LONDON, March 23.â The Rome correspondent of the Daily Telegraph says: The Pope
is beginning to suffer from depression. During the service on Sunday he asked one of
his personal attendants how many in the congregation he (the attendant) thought really
rejoiced in his recovery.
Then he added, despondently: "What a mockery it isâ this thanksgiving fdr my re
cover}*. I shall not live a week."
The exclamation was followed by a prolonged and alarming: fainting fit.
NEW YORK, March 22. â A dispatch to the World from Washington says-: Apos
tolic Delegate Martinelli, who is in constant receipt of news from private sources in Rome
concerning the Pope's condition, believes that the Pontiff's extreme age renders it extremely
probable that his end cannot be far olf.
A recent letter from a Vatican official quotes the Pope as saying since his last attack:
"When I die I shall not give much trouble to the doctors, nurses or servants. lam only skin
and bone, and my life will go out like a lamp which has no oil to feed it."
Church officials here think that it is just the way the Pontiff will go to his rest, and that
already he is nearer the end than is believed in this country.

WOODLAND. March 22.â For nearly
twenty-four hours there has been
a continuous shower, but the

conditions. There is no longer any ap
prehension of a dry season. All doubts
on this score have beeen dispelled. The

TO PROTECT
BEET SUGAR
INDUSTRY
Secretary of Agriculture Wil
son's Plan May Yet Be
Carried Out.
TARIFF WALL NEEDED
Future of the Growing Product Is
Assured by the Operations of
Claus Spreckels and Others,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 22.â A "Washing
ton special to the Evening Post says:
When James Wilson entered the Cabi
net as Secretary of Agriculture he ex
pected to identify his name in history
with the beet sugar industry in the
United States. He had long believed this
country should raise its own sugar and
pay the bills. . Just as the tin plate
business has recently been established
here he hoped that this administration
would mark the complete establishment
lof the beet sugar industry. Such may
yet be the case.
â¦ â¦â¦â¦â¦* + <4. + + + + + + + + + +
â¦ â¦
â¢+â  But by the peculiar irony of â¦
+ fate it also fell to this adminis- rf
+ tration to acquire a vast amount +
I + of tropical country of which su- +
-f gar cane is the leading product. +
â¦ According to the obvious intent â¦
+ of the constitution cane sugar +
â +â  would have come in free and the â â¦â 
â f beet sugar industry been given a -f
+ knock-down blow. +
â¦ â¢ â¦
â +â¦ â¦ + â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦
But as Mr. Wilson and those who
agreed with him in the councils of the
President were not willing to give up
the beet sugar idea they have given an
Impetus to the notion that in some way
a tariff wall against our tropical pos
sessions would be maintained. When
the historian comes to write of the se
quences of the Spanish war and this
probable change of our tariff policy he
will find the key to the economic change
in one word â "sugar." Thus this great
product is making history.
Although Secretary Wilson has felt
sure the products of Porto Rico and the
Philippines would not be admitted to
our markets free he has no little con
cern over the future of his favorite in
dustry. Some time ago he requested
C. F. Saylor, who is the special agent
in charge of the sugar experiments of
the United States, to go to Porto Rico
and there investigate the sugar prob
lem in its relation to the beet sugar
problem in the .United States. Mr. Say
lor has just returned. He does not talk
politics and will not discuss the consti
tutional and revenue side of the sugar
problem, but from his findings of fact
it is very easy to draw positive conclu
sions. He says that the Porto â¢ Rican.
can raise sugar for 2 cents a pound
i and the American beet growers can
i raise sugar of the same standard for
13% cents a pound. In this light it looks
i as if a tariff would continue to be nec
essary to keep up cur beet sugar in
dustry. Mr. Saylor believes that this
I disparity in cost of production in the
I two countries will lessen as time goes
on.
In' the course of an interview Mr.
! Baylor said: "In this country we are
I now producing yearly 289,000 tons of
cane sugar, 41,000 tons of beet sugar,
I 5000 tons of maple sugar and 3000 tons
of sorghum. In the last year we have
doubled the number of beet sugar fac
tories and more than doubled the ca
pacity of their output.
"Claus Spreckels, who is a good Judge
of the future of the industry, has
erected a factory at Salinas, Cal., which
has a capacity for working 3000 tons of
beets daily. This would make a freight
train laden with sugar beets more than
a mile long.
"Henry Oxnard has built a huge fac
tory near Hueneme, Cal., and other fac
tories are in operation in California,
Oregon. Utah, New Mexico, Minnesota,
Nebraska, Michigan, Illinois and New
York. Eight factories are now building â

Aguinaldo Does Some Wild Talk
About Leading an Advance
Upon Manila.
MA XI LA. March 22.âAd
vices have Seen received
from Catbalogan, island of
Samar, showing that trouble with
the natives there is certain to oc-
cur. The headquarters of Gen
eral Lukbani, the insurgent
leader, is at Catbalogan. The
place has been fortified to resist
attack, the women and children
have been removed from the
town to safe places in the in
interior, and General Lukbani de
clares he will never surrender, but
will burn the place if necessary to
prevent it falling into the hands
of the Americans.
The situation of all foreigners
in Catbalogan is precariors. as
the insurgents are ugly, and l icre
is danger of the natives attacking
them.
It is impossible for Otis to send
troops from Manila to the island,
the situation here precluding any
such action. There is great need
for all the troops now here and
those on the way, and the small
ness of the American force ren
ders extensive military move
ments, particularly in the outly
ing islands, practically out of the
question.
Advires from Cebu report everything
quiet there, but an uneasy feeling pre
vails. The British gunboat Plover,
Captain Cowper, sailed from Cohu
March 14 for Ormoc to rescue a British
subject named Cogan, who had been
taken prisoner by the natives. Upon
arriving at Ormoc the Plover found
that Cogan had been removed by his
captors from that place. The Plover
then proceeded to Catbalogan, where it
was learned that Cogan had been taken
to the island of Leyte. A native offi
cer, under orders from General Luk
bani, went on board the warship to as
sist in securing C'ogan's release and the
Plover sailed for Leyte, where the pris
oner was found. His release was ob
tained, but a fight with the natives was
narrowly averted as he was being
taken aboard the Plover.
Captain Cowper found that the na
tives had three Spanish prisoners and
offered to take them aboard ship if they
were released. The natives refused to
surrender them.
Trouble is also threatened at Malit
bog, on the island of Leyte. The na
tives there imagine all foreigners are
plotting apainst them and there is
much uneasinoP? on both sides.
The naval transport Solace and the
troopship Sherman arrived to-day. The
troops aboard are in excellent health,
the only sickness among them being a
few cases of measles. One child, two
eallors and two privates died on the
voyage and one man was drowned in
the Mediterranean.
While apparently inactive since Sun
day, really the opposite .has been the
case with the American forces. ' A. re
organization, entaUins, many changes.
has been in progress. Since the aban
flonrr*Â»nt rtf the flying: column General
Wheaton's and General Hale's brigades
have not been assigned, but the Ore
gon regiment, the Minnesota regiment
and the Twenty-second, regiment have
been concentrated at the camp or. the
Luneta, on the water front, in readi
ness for immediate transportation
when the plans of the military leaders
have been formulated. Our troops are
entrenched and the situation is prac
tically unchanged.
The enemy has refrained from mak
ing any attacks recently and It would
appear that the rebels are saving their
ammunition for a decisive movement.
According to a prisoner captured by
our troops, Aguinaldo has announced
that he will personally conduct the re
serves at Malolos and march into Ma
nila within twenty days unless the
Americans withdraw in the meantime.
The concentration of rebel forces in
the vicinity of Malabon gives color to
the statement of the prisoner.
One hundred persons arrested here
on suspicion of aiding the rebels have
been released, there being no evidence
to show that they had assisted the in
surgents in any way.
AUTONOMY PROMISED
TO THE FILIPINOS
NEW YORK. March 22.â A Journal
cable from Manila says: The procla
mation to the Filipinos which is about
to be issued by the Philippine Com
mission will assure the population of
the Islands of the intention of the
T'nited States to endeavor to develop
among the natives the power of self
government.
This manifesto will also clearly ex
plain that the American Government
has assumed international obligations
which make it responsible to the whole
world for the establishment of a stable
government in the archipelago, and
that It cannot divest itself of these re
sponsibilities.
The Philippine Commission will in
terpret to the people the purposes of
the President, and will also suggest a
form of government which will suit
the present necessities and the capac
ity of the Filipinos, consistent with the
interests of the United States.
The commission will assure the peo
ple that the President only desires to
establish a system under which the
Filipinos will become capable to ad
minister their own affairs under Amer
ican control and protection. It will
bo made clear to the Filipinos that no
spirit of tyranny or vengeance pos
sesses the United States. Having de-
Btroyed the Spanish power peace Is

THE TAGALS USING
BRASS-TIPPED BULLETS
NEW YORK, March 22. â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: Reports received at the War Department to-day from
medical officers serving with the troops in the Philippines show that
Aguinaldo's army is using brass-tipped bullets.
Several American soldiers have been wounded by these poisonous
projectiles, and in consequence the wounds are more difficult to heal
than those caused by the ordinary bullet. Of course the authorities
can do nothing to prevent the insurgents using any kind of bullets they
can find. They have no government to which an appeal can be made.
Their action in this respect, the officials say, is another indication of
their utter unfltness for self-government.
MINDANAO MORROS
HOLD AMERICAN
SAILORS AT BAY
Not a Man Has Yet Been Landed
at Zamboango From the
Cruiser Boston.
âº IIXHLO, March 22.â The coasting steamer Romulus has arrived here
fr-vn Zambnanpa. on the island of Mindanao, with upward of I<V> pas
â¢ sengera, including Spanish officials with their wives and families who
are returning to Spain. They report that 2000 Spanish troops, collected
' from the southern islands, are at Zamboanga awaiting a transport.
, which is long overdue.
When the Romulus sailed on Monday no Americans had been land
i ed from the cruiser Boston. Provisions are purchased from the
Moros, who freely enter the town armed with knives and spears.
> The Spanish commandant. General Montero. advised the Ameri
cans not to land, except in small numbers, because the natives threat
-1 en a conflict and iritend to take possession of the town. Their atti
, tude is determined.
The Romulus brings Spaniards and natives returning to Cebu,
i whence they fled upon the abandonment by the Spanish garrison.
A passenger says the Boston was grounded for two days at Zam

ereignty of the American Government
is accepted. The Insurgents will be in
vited to lay down their arms and to
trust in the Government that emanci-
pated them from oppression.
It is now evident the majority of the
members of the Philippine Commission
are inclined to grant to the Filipinos a
port of tribal or provincial local au
tonomy, under a central American re
gime, which shall be of a military char
acter until a purely civil system can be
introduced.
The address of the commission will
be printed in all the dialects of the
archipelago and will be posted on all
the Islands. It is hoped that a great
majority of intelligent natives will at
once desert the cause of the insurgents,
a result which the commission confi
dently believes will surely ensue should
the insurgents suffer another defeat.
OTIS WILL BEGIN
FORWARD MOVEMENT
NEW YORK, March 22.â The Wash
ing correspondent of the Herald tele-
graphs:
It was officially stated at the State
Department to-day that the proclama
tion issued by the Philippine Commis
sion is in accordance with instructions
given to President Schurman and his
associates. It is the understanding of
officials here that within forty-eight
hours General Otis will recommence
active work against the Filipinos by fol
lowing up the proclamation of the com
mission. In this manner, the officials
say, he will impress upon the Filipinos
the purpose of the United States to end
the insurrection and the hopelessness
of further resistance.

SOLDIER'S ACCOUNT
OF THE FIGHTING
In an interesting letter descriptive of
the early fighting with the Filipinos
at Manila Sergeant H. L. Leffmann of
Company L. First California Volun
teers, who carried the colors during the
battle, writes:
Company G put a patrol on the road
leading to the firing line and was fired
upon by the enemy from behind houses.
Immediately we pitched into the houses,
capturing fifty-three prisoners and killing
seven natives. Alter that we set fire to
the whole place. Nearly every house con
tained guns and ammunition, so we had to
"make ourselves scarce," as shots were
flying in all directions. During all this
time the boys on the firing line were
pumping lead into the natives at a great
rate and the natives were doing the same
to us. The boys were falling rapidly when
the order for a charge was given. With a
whoop and a yell they jumped up and
made a grand charge. The enemy could
not stand it, and. oecame demoralized.
They retreated, with the Idahos. Wash
ingtons and Californians after them red
hot.
General King was there, looking as cool
as a cucumber, giving directions to this
regiment and then to the next one. Rid
ing up to our boys he yelled to them as
they were charging: "Give them ,
California boys; give them !"
He was answered with three cheers and
a tiger and away. they went, across field
after field to the town of Santa Ana. Tere
Were two Krupp guns, in a sort of fort,
but this did not stop them. They contin
ued on and burned the town.
After the insurgents retreated from
Santa Ana a party In a church in the rear
of our headquarters commenced firing: on
us, at the same time flying a white flag.
Our company deployed and ,yr^ banged, At2
them for half an hour from behind a stone
wall. We succeeded in killing a couple,
but couid not get at the main body. W a
, sent word to the artillery, which
â was situated about a mile away, and had
them bombard the church. ISot a shot
missed though they could not see the
place. In a few minutes the church was
ir. ruins and burning, but still no one ap
peared. Finally eight of the nallves ran
m:t nnd received a volley from us. They
1 up their toes. Still we could not
iiccount for the rest.
.After the fire died out there remained
only the ruins of the church and a higii
: iwer alongside. About two hours after
that firing was recommenced from the
tower, ar.d we had to attack it again, and
also bombard it. Although it was reduced
to ruins still no one made an appearance.
AYe surmised that they must have a secret
exit, and although we had the place sur
rounded we cov.ld not find any one.
Meanwhiio the fighting on the left was
fierce. An orderly came dashing up
and Company I, received orders to join
General Ovenshine's brigade. Away over
to the left we went, joining the Four
teenth regulars. Fourth Cavalry and one
company of Washingrtons. They had made
a charge and were driven back. Joined
by L, company and some other troops
they made another dash. This time we
succeeded, and how we ever escaped I
cannot Bullets were thicker than
hall, and dead natives were piled two and
three hiph. Away the Insurgents fled be
fore us. jumping into the river, into wells,
and feigning death. We drove them back
some miles past a road that led to San
Pedro Macate. We stopped here, as the
battle, which lasted some twenty-two
hours, had enued, although there was a
little firing off and on during the night.

STRIFE OVER PROFITS
â¢ FOR BURYING DEAD
LOS ANGELES, March 22.-The war
fare on the part of the Coroner against
certain undertakers has been revived by
the death of Fong Kirn, a Chinese woman
who expired in* the Receiving Hospital
from the effects of opium self-admmis
tored Coroner Holland notified one firm
to take charge of the body, but fnends
of the- deceased desired that she be buried
by another. By jugglery the firm which
the Coroner indicated obtained the corpse.
The husband of the dead woman asserts
âand witnesses confirm his statementsâ
that the Coroner took him into a back
room and threatened to "make it warm
for him" if he did not permit the funeral
to take place from a designated under
taking establishment, and intimated th.it
extra expenses would bo added to thÂ©
case. This pressure won the victory. The
Coroner denies the charges,, but the body
was buried by the firm he favored.

GERMANS INSIST
THAT CHAMBERS
BE WITHDRAWN
Threaten to Take Up Arms
Against Americans in
Samoa.
ERLIN, March 22.â A petition was received at the Foreign Office here
to-day, signed by all the Germans in Samoa, protesting vehemently
against the retention of Chief Justice Chambers and the. further main
tenance of the Berlin treaty, which is characterized as no longer bear
able. The petitioners detail a number of alleged contraventions of the
treaty by Mr. Chambers and especially toward Herr Grevesmuhl, the Chief
of Police. The petition and the official reports will be sent to the United
States Embassador, Andrew D. White, in support of the German case.
The Lokal Anzeiger publishes a letter from its Samoan correspondent,
Herr yon Wolfersdorff, dated February 21. After recounting the critical
situation the writer declares that if the German Government will not help
the Germans of Apia against the alleged injustice and outrages of Mr.
Chambers the Germans will rise armed and obtain the desired redress.
The correspondent then describes the indignation of the Germans when
the instructions of the Foreign Office arrived, ordering the recognition of
Mr. Chambers.
The Tageblatt demands the removal of F. B. S. Maxse, the British Con
sul at Apia, claiming he is the prime cause of all the trouble.
Alluding to the inconveniences of the Berlin treaty, the petition from
Samoan Germans begs that if the Government cannot annul the treaty and
declare a German protectorate, it shall at least obtain an amendment se
curing "real equality of privilege" to the three nations, so that German
law, language and money may be assured equality of privilege, that offi
cials may be appointed under the treaty who understand the German
language and that the powers of the Chief Justice may be properly de
fined. The petitioners oppose partition.
CRACKER AND
CANDY TRUST
Consolidation of Pacific
Coast Plants.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. March 22.âFollow
ing closely the recent announcement
that a cracker trust would be formed
on the Pacific Coast by Charles M.
Warner of Syracuse comes the infor
mation to the commercial world that
a syndicate is now paving the way to
create a great candy trust to control
the sweetmeat industry of the Western
slope.
Robert Shaw of Chicago and former
Corporation Counsel Charles E. Ide of
Syracuse have been here, taking an
inventory of the two local cracker fac
toriesâthose of the Southern California
Cracker Company and Bishop & Co.
These concerns, manufacturing crack
ers and candies, have agreed to sell
their cracker departments to the trust.
The two men are now in San Francisco
making an inspection of the Standard
and the American Biscuit Companies'
plants.
While here they entered into nego
tiations with local firms to have them
dispose of their candy departments to
Warner and his colleagues. The three
members of the Southern California
Cracker Company agreed to transfer
their whole interests in the candy busi
ness to Shaw, the agent of the trust.
They have signed documents agreeing
to remain out of the candy business in
the district to be occupied by the pro
posed buyers for twenty yeaTs. Bishop
& Co. have ndt given the trust an op
tioa on their candy department, which
includes the manufacturing of crystal
lized fruits also. It is understood they
ask for a bonus amounting to a con
siderable sum. Shaw regards this as
too large.
If the trust cannot get Bishop"s candy
business at its own price it will re
linquish the option on the cracker plant,
and in order to exterminate its rival
the trust will cut prices on crackers
nnd candies. If the undesirable com
petitor cannot be "frozen out" by this
procedure it may be compelled to sell
at the figures of the trust.
FORTY-NINE PERSONS
ARE YET MISSING
NEW YORK, March 22.â Besides the
fifteen whose dead bodies have been re
covered, forty-nine persons who are sup
posed to have been in the Windsor Hotel
when it was destroyed on Friday are yet
unaccounted for. No bodies were recov
ered to-day, but shortly after 6 o'clock to
night a fragment of charred flesh Was
found on the Fifth avenue side of the
ruins near where other bodies were found,
but deeper down.
The five bodies that were recovered on
Monday and Tuesday, or what remains
of them, are still at the Morgue. One has
partly been identified by two of the hotel
employes as that of Mrs. Margaret Auzee
of New York, but this identification is
not considered conclusive.
The rain to-day interfered with the
rapid progress of the work to some ex
tent and it was not until the afternoon
that the workers succeeded in getting
steadily down to the removal of the de
bris. The Fire Department still has its
lines about the ruins, Isolating a consid
erable section of one of tho busiest parts
of the city. A force of about 250 men was
employed throughout the afternoon and
a new shift of Die same number was put
on at night.

OAKLAND, March 22.â The old mon
itor Comanche is not to be broken up.
She is to be dismantled, rehabilitated
and will be seen for years doing a
freight and ferry business on San
Francisco Bay. Such is the deci'ee of
her new owners.
The bid of Messrs. Pantesky. Berco
vich & Livingston of this city was ac
cepted at Washington to-day. This
firm was very anxious to secure the
old hulk and made a bid higher than
they would have done had they not
seen a profitable future for the Co
manche.
Several days ago the firm sent a bid
to Washington, but this morning, fear
ing that others had bid higher, they
sent a substantial raise* by telegraph
of their former figures. The result. of
the bidding shows that their latest
figures were accepted.
"We had a survey made of the Co
manche," said Mr. Pantesky to-night,
"and decided that she was just the
boat we wanted for a freight ferry.
We do a big freight business ourselves
and see a need for such a boat. We
shall take out her engines and put in
good machinery and use her on the
bay. She will carry about 1800 tons,
and we will have plenty of work for
her. Our plans call for the expendi
ture of $50,000."

FURY UPON A
WOMAN'S HEAD
Cowardly Crime of a Los An
geles Man at Loomis,
Wash.
AGED WIDOW BEATEN
Clubbed With a Revolver Because
She Refused to Alter a
Contract.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 22.â A special from
Doomis, in the northeastern part of
Washington, says: In a neat five-room
cabin on a ranch two and a half miles
north of Loomis lies the victim of what
is considered one of the most cowardly
acts man could commit. Mrs. Julia Un
derwood, for refusing to abrogate a
contract made last September in the
name of E. H. Melrose of Los Angeles,
and signing a new one much more to
his interest and in his right name, E. H.
O'Melveny, was brutally beaten into a
state of insensibility with a 44-caliber
revolver.
No witnesses were present. A niece
of Mrs. Underwood, Miss Lou Hunt,
had been asked to absent herself, as
they had business of a private nature
to discuss. Miss Hunt complied, and
some time later returned to find the
room in disorder and confusion, Melrose
highly excited and Mrs. Underwood on
the bed unconscious, with a towel
around her head saturated with blood.
With presence of mind. Miss Hunt
forced her aunt's assailant to go for
Dr. Willard at Loomis. The young lady
then summoned the ranch foreman,
and together they succeeded in bring
ing Mrs. Underwood to a state of semi
consciousness, when she little by little
told how her injuries had been received.
Melrose, who has been receiving mail
both as Melrose and O'Melveney, came
from Los Angeles, Cal., and repre
sented himself as a cattleman seeking
health. In this way he leased the Un
derwood ranch and cattle. He was to
pay all expenses for a certain interest.
Mrs. Underwood, it is claimed, finding
out his real character, confronted him
with it, and since then there has been
trouble, culminating in the attack.
Mrs. Underwood is 65 years of age,
a widow, with a married daughter in
Grundy County, lowa, whence she
came to this place in 1894.
Melrose is about five feet eight inches
tall, rather Blight, has brown hair and
mustache streaked with gray, promi
nent ears, wrinkles about and below
the eyes, a receding chin with center
dimple, and is 41 years old. He was
last seen a few miles south of the in
ternational line. A posse of five dep
uties is out searching for him. and a
suitable reward will be offered for his
capture.
Dr. Willard reports Mrs. Under
wood's condition as favorable, though
still very critical. The wound in the
back of her head is quite serious.
JOHN COLLINS HAS
MADE A CONFESSION
PAINESVILLE, 0., March 22.â John
Collins, who was arrested here yesterday
with Mrs. Ann Ingersoll on the charge
of abducting Gerald Lapiner from in
front of his parents' house in Chicago
about a year ago, has made a confession.
Collins says he is an old soldier. He
was an inmate of the National Military
Home at Los Angeles. There he met
Mrs. Ingersoll. She told him she had a
farm at Painesville and asked him to
come east and live with her. They came
to Chicago, where they arrived a few
days before the last of May, 189 S. On
Decoration day Mrs; Ingersoll came to
him with the child. She said she had
found the little one on the street. They
remained in Chicago a few days and then
came east to Painesville. Collins said he
had no suspicion that the child had been
abducted and he believed Mrs. Ingersoll
when she said she had found the little
one.
Collins was held in $300 and Mrs. In
gersoll in $3000 bail for the hearing on
Thursday. A hearing was had to-night
on a writ of habeas corpus, and Judge
Clark, of the Common Pleas Court,
awarded the custody of the child to Mrs.
Lapiner.

BALLINGTON BOOTH'S
FRICTION WITH THE
SALVATION ARMY
CHICAGO, March 22.-The recent clash between the Sa Jy a "Â°? j l â¢* ffjj
Volunteers during a street parade of the latter, headed by General
Ballington Booth, has resulted in a deal of trouble between the^ vo
organizations. The showing by magic lantern of a deathbed picture
of Ballington Booth's mother at the moment of the general s appear
ance has caused much bitterness, and at a council of the general officers or
the Volunteers the following statement was given out:
"We. the undersigned, seventy-seven staff and field commanding officers
assembled in regimental council, desire to express our opinion that, while n
would be generally conceded by the many friends and associates of the \ Â«
unteers that General and Mrs. Ballington Booth have acted with great dis
cretion in withholding from the press and platform their feelings respect ng
the actions of the Salvation Army, most wishing to avoid any resurrection
of public controversy, yet, in justice to our many Volunteers and friends in
and around Chicago and In contradiction of certain statements, it is only
right and fair that we should express our admiration of the Christian spirit
exhibited by the Volunteers in the face of the manifestations of un-Chris
tian, un-American and bitter spirit on the part of the Salvationists yester
day.
"We were having a peaceable parade, witnessed by hundreds of people,
when we were shocked to witness the action of certain officers of the Salva
tion Army. General Booth's mother's picture was thrown on the screen just
as he was passing, both backward and forward, purposely to create the im
pression that he made vows to the Salvation Army at her deathbed, when,
as we all know, at the time of her death he was in Maryland, U. S. A. Fur
ther, in the presence of our leader. General Booth, Brigadier General Field
ing, Colonel James Keppel and others, one Salvation Army staff officer said,
with a hiss through his teeth: 'Hurrah for Major Moore's army' (a name
associated with a reputed scandal).
"Another member shouted, shaking his fist in our faces: 'You devils,
you!' while a third, who was also an officer, pointing to the screen, said:
'Look at that. How can you do it when you made vows at your mother's
bed?'
"We take this as an Insult to our leader and our visiting officers to the
city of Chicago, and feel that, as citizens, we have a right to demand a pub
lic apology from Lieutenant Colonel French, as it is a distinct breach of the
compact between General Ballington Booth and his father, General William
Booth.
â¢'lt is such actions as these which have brought from the Salvation
Army to the Volunteers during the last few weeks Lieutenant Colonel and
Mrs. Keppel, Brigadier General and Mrs. Marshall, Staff Captain Thomas,
Adjutant and Mrs. Johnson, Staff Captain and Mrs. Leecher, Adjutant
Prayer, Major Lennox. Captain and Mrs. Anderson, Captain and Mrs. Beedy,
Captain and Mrs. Turk, Captain Lamming and many others whom we
could name.
"Furthermore, we resolve that this resolution be tendered to the Asso
ciated Press. Â»

ALGER`S PETTY
SUP AT MILES
Orders That Censure
Two Generals.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 22.
The Secretary of "War, in an order,
which will be published through official
channels to-morrow, has censured Ma
jor General Miles and Inspector General
Breckinridge for attempting to exceed
their authority in military matters.
The censure is in consequence of the
tour of Inspection which General Breck
inridge is now making in Porto Rico
and an investigation recently made by
Lieutenant Colonel Ernest A. Garling
ton of the inspector general's depart
ment in connectic-n with the charges
made by Miles about the character of
beef served to troops In the field.
General Breckinridge was ordered
about two months ago to proceed to
Cuba and Porto Rico far the purpose
of inspecting the military camps in
those islands. His orders were issued
by the Secretary of War. It has since
been reported to the War Department,
however, that Breckinridge is engaged
in gathering evidence to support the
allegations of Miles, and in so doing has
proceeded to places to which he was
not ordered by the Secretary of War,
and has been devoting time to work for
the benefit of Miles and outside the in
structions issued by the Secretary.
Colonel Garlington recently went to
Chicago, ostensibly to- make certain in
vestigations coming within the province
of the inspector general's -department.
He did not go by authority of the Sec
retary of War. It was recently ascer
tained by the War Department that he
was devoting time to making inquiries
with which the board to investigate the
charges of Miles abc.-ut canned and re
frigerated beef had been charged, thus
undertaking without authority of the
department to make an independent in
vestigation of matters with which a
board composed of his superior officers
and appointed by direction of the
President had been intrusted.
When these facts became known to
the War Department an official in
quiry w T as made to ascertain by whose
authority Breckinridge and Garlington
were making investigations which had
not been sanctioned by the departmtMit.
It is said the department found that
Miles and Breckinridge were responsi
ble. As a consequence, the Seeretn.iv
oJE War will, to-morrow, issue an order
providing that hereafter officers of the
inspector general's department shrill
not proceed from point to point for the
purpose of making investigations with
out the authority of the Secretary of
War.
Secretary Alger was not consulted as
to the trip which Colonel Garllngton
has just completed, and was forced to
take the action contained in the order
from the fact that officers of his own
department were making independent
investigations of which he had no
knowledge, evidently intended to un
dermine the authority of the head of
the department and that of the board
of officers appointed by direction of the
President.
This is taken as a direct slap at
Miles, who, during the war, notified
Secretary Alger it wae not his (Miles')
business to make inspections, but to
order them made; in other words, that
the inspector general's department was
directly responsible to the commanding
general. _______^____

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March 22.â
When the Paris reached here yesterday
those on board of her noticed that the
flag flying from Morro Castle, at the
entrajice of the harbor, was at half
mast, and it was inferred by the pas
sengers that some chief perso-nage was
dead. Their surprise was great when
told on being reached by a tug that a
report was current that Mr. Sherman
was dead.
It now turns out respecting the un
fortunate report of Mr. Sherman's
death, which is the main topic of con
versation here to-day, that the an
nouncement was made by the French
cable company and the signal corps
within ten minutes of each other. When
Captain Leigh, the chief signal officer,
ascertained that the report was er
roneous he immediately communicated
with the Guantanamo station to dis
cover the cause of the blunder. The
man in charge of the station replied
that having received a message of in
quiry as to Mr. Sherman's health, and
not having any information himself, he
visited the manager of the French cable
company, who assured him that the re
port of the death was well founded.
Thereupon he telegrt.phed a confirma
tion of the rumor, having no reason to
doubt the assurance given him. The
French cable company's officials here
clafm to know nothing' regarding tr.^
matter. .
Mr. Sherman's relatives on board the
Paris are naturally somewhat indignant
at somebody's stupendous blunder, but
Captain Leigh considers that the man
in charge of the Guantanamo signal
c-fflce w r as entirely justified in accepting
the statement of the French cable com
pany's manager.
Mr. Sherman's condition this evening
continues about the same. He rested
quite comfortably throughout the day,
and if anything is somewhat better. He
expects to go .on board the United
States cruiser Chicago to-morrow.
SHERMAN FELL
INTO THE' WATER
NEW YORK. March 22.â A letter
from Porto Rico says that at the time
of the visit of the steamship Paris to
Porto Rico, on March 11, Senator Sher
man, on returning to the ship fro-m the
city, fell into the water. It is probable
that the illness from which he is now
suffering: was contracted at that time.

Delegates Will Be So
Instructed.
DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE
CREDENTIALS FOR UNCLE SAM'S
REPRESENTATIVES.
President McKinley Will Have an
Opportunity to Advocate the
Policy Which He Has Al
ways Championed.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, March 22.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: There is reason to be
lieve that an important proposition
looking to the settlement of interna
tional disputes by arbitration will be
advanced at the coming disarmament
conference by the American delegates.
I learned to-day on high authority that
the credentials for and instructions to
American delegates are no*w being pre
pared by Secretary Hay and will be
ready for submission to the President
for his approval when he returns to
Washington from his Southern trip.
These instructions will be a complete
exposition of the attitude of this Gov
ernment on the question of disarma
ment and arbitration.
Sir Julian Pauncefote has been ad
visod of his appointment as senior
member of the British delegation. The
UnUch Minister to The Hague will also
be a member. M. de Stael, Russian
Ambassador in Great Britain and a
leading representative of the Czar at
the conference, will be assisted by Pro-
I â¢ Martens, professor of interna
tional ia\v in the University at
Petersburg, and probably by the Rus
sian Minister to The Hague.
Following the policy which it seems
likely that all nations will adopt Presi
dent McKinley will accredit the Minis
ter t j the Netherlands as one o-f
the American delegates. Ernbassadors
"White and Tower will probably be the
other members of the American dele
gation.
It was explained to me by a diplo
mat having knowledge of the present
programme of the Russian Government
that upon the assembling of the dele
gates a committee will be appointed to
determine the subjects to come before
â¢the conference and the order in which
they shall be considered.
E far as the proposition for general
disarmament of the nations of the
world is concerned, it will be the duty
of the American delegates to explain
ami to show that the United States
both from a military and naval stand-
I is far below the armament it
should have, and besides it was ex
plained to me that this Government

the inventive faculty of the people of
this country. Nor is it expected that
: Britain will do so. In fact, the
. irtant result which the offl
t the conference will be
the adoption of some plan for the refer
ence of disputes to general arbitration,
and the United States will have a plan

The administration is strongly in fa
: arbitration as a means for set
:' disputes between nations,
hile it appreciates that there are
a number of controversies that can
only be settled by war, it is still be
lieved that many questions which arise
and are consequences of much friction
can be arbitrated. The President is
committed to international arbitration
by his inaugural address and by sub
sequent declarations, but his adminis
tration has not attempted to negotiate
arbitration treaties, for one reason be
cause of the imminence of war with
Spain and the occurrence of war. In
view of the assembling of the confer
ence at The Hague it is thought by the
officials that the time has come when
the administration can put itself on
record before the world as favoring ar
bitration.

FORCING A TARIFF

(Action of the British GovernmeQt
Briogs oq o Political
Crisis.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, March 22.â A political crisis, said to be the
mr>Ft important since 1863, is now occupying the attention of Jamaica.
The Governor, Sir Augustus Hemming, as forecast in these dispatches on
February 21, prorogued the Legislature yesterday and reconvened it for
to-day by the order of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph
Chamberlain, for the purpose of introducing the obnoxious tariff bill
taxing industrial implements and literature, which the Council rejected
on March 15, the Governor at the same time bringing In four new official
members to outvote the representatives.
The Jamaica Association has convened public meetings throughout
the country and it has cabled to- Mr. Chamberlain explaining the gravity
of the situation. Much anxiety prevails and it is expected there will be
trouble if the Government persists In its present policy.
MORION SPEAKS
OF A NEW PARTY
Danger to Sound Money
Due to Apathy.
SILVER MEN ARE ACTIVE
AND THE "COIN" HARTTET FUND
GROWS RAPIDLY.
The Former Secretary of Agriculture
Says a New Organization May
Be Formed of Democrats
and Republicans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEBRASKA CITY, Neb.. March 22.â
"The danger to the cause of sound
money lies in the apathy of its
friends," said J. Sterling Morton, for
mer Secretary of Agrciulture, to me
to-day. "Free Silver men are always
active, always working," he continued.
"Bryan is on the stump every day, and
'Coin' Harvey is having great suc
cess apparently in raising a campaign
fund. I see it is claimed this fund is
coming in at the rate of $SOO a day.
When a fund of this kind grows as
rapidly as that, it is evident that there
is still a great deal of free silver lun
acy abroad in the country. We will
have the money question to fight all
over again next year."
"Do you think Mr. Bryan's Demo
cratic party stands any chance of win
ning?" was asked.
"I can't say that I do," replied Mr.
Morton. "Democratic principles might
win. There may be a new party arise
out of the present situation which will
adopt these principles and be success
ful. This party would be composed
of Democrats and Republicans opposed
to annexation and to the present ex
travagance in the expenditure of pub
lic money in nation, State and city. I
think Mr. Bryan's hold upon the hys
terical and paroxysmal section of the
Democratic party is as strong as ever.
He represents the discontent in all par
ties. He is an attractive exhorter and
works his hearers up to a sort of
frenzy as do religious revivalists."
"Do you think the Bryan Democracy
will control the next Democratic co-n
--vention?"'
"I did think so, but at this late flay
I have hud hopes it would not. There
seems to be little letting down in the
free silver cause."
"What chance has the Democratic
party of winning?"
"Little under that name. Democratic
principles can win, but it seems as
though they must be advanced under
another name."
'Who would be the no-mince of the
neu party?"
"Well, there are several good men
I who represent types which are called
1 for. There is Edmunds, for instance.
I have great admiration /or Carl
; Schurz, but he was uorn in Germany,
I and so is not available."
"Do you think there is any chance
â  of Mr. Cleveland returning to political
! life?"
"He might not want to," said Mr.
Morton, "but he may be dragged back
' Into it. He is a good type of the man
\ wanted."
"Do you think this new or conserva
tive party would grow Ifct enough to
win the fight of 1900?"
"Perhaps, but it is better to make a
fight for what is right and get beaten
than to support what is wrong."
NEW YORK, March 22.â A meeting:
of labor agitators, social reformers,
silver men and delegates from several
bodies organized for the advancement
of various kinds of social conditions
was held in this city to-day. Rev. Dr.
W. S. Rainsford presided for a time,
and then his place was taken by C. F.
Baird of Philadelphia. While the con
ference was informal, some of the par
ticipants have a plan whereby it is
thought a national party will be or
ganized.
Among those present were Dr. C. F.
Taylor of Philadelphia, Eugene V.
Debs. Herman J. Schulters and A. S.
Dulin, both of Washington, and Pres
ident George P. Keeney of the Asso
ciation of National Silver Clubs. Most
of those present made speeches and
the advisability of calling a national
conference was discussed, though no
action was taken. Mr. Keeney said an
other meeting would be held, and he
thought some plan would be agreed
upon then. It is said that if the con
vention is called it will be held in Buf
falo about June 28 or July 4. at which
time the National Social and Political
Conference will be held In that city.
FOB. A MAGNIFICENT ABODE.
Young Vanderbilt's Name Mentioned
in Connection With a
Realty Sale.
NEW YORK. March 22.â The name of
William K. Vanderbilt Jr. was mentioned
to-day in connection with the reported
sale of property on Fifth avenue, between
Seventy-second and Seventy-third streets.
According to a Btory, which obtained
more or less credence in real estate cir
cles. Mr. Vanderhilt intends to have built
a magnificent residence on the property.
As he is engaged to Miss Virginia Fair
and the w.-dding will take place soon, the
story appeared to have some foundation.
Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, mother of Mr.
Vanderbilt. was seen this evening and
asked whether she had any information
in regard to the reported sale, and re
plied that she had not.
Women Who Would Vote.

THE SAN FKASTCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1899.
BEEF THAT CAUSED
SICKNESS AND DEATH
CHICAGO. March 22.â The mem
bers of the Government court of
inquiry finished their labors in
Chicago to-day and left for New
York this evening. The testi
mony of Governor Roosevelt will there
be received, after which the court will
proceed to Governors Island.
The evidence brought forth to-day
was largely cumulative in its character,
consisting mainly of criticisms of the j
canned beef and refrigerated beef from j
soldiers who ate it and watched its j
effects in Cuba and Porto Rico.
David Fleischman. a bellboy in the j
Hotel Morrison, told of a visit to the :
stockyards in the company of an un- |
known man, whose purpose he supposed
to be an experiment in the matter of \
preserving beef by chemical treatment.
W. C. Marshall, the provision special- :
Ist, whose testimony was expected to be
sensational, threw no additional light
on the question, hie evidence being prin
cipally the expression of the opinion
that canned beef as now put on the i
market is totally unfit for human food. ;
Lieutenant J. D. L. Hartman of the |
First Cavalry, who was acting regimental
quartermaster while the regiment was
Stationed at Lakeland, Fla., testified that
refrigerator beef was received from Ar
mour & Co. It was brought to Lakeland i
in cars. At first it was very good and
! there was no objection to it, but in three
or four days it began to get poorer in
quality. In two instances a board of
Burvey rejected the beef. In one case j
the witness rejected a whole carload, j
The stench was observable before the car :
was opened. The beef was not received
because decomposition had set in. The J
rejected beef was not accounted for in j
the vouchers.
David A. Fleischman testified that he ;
was employed as bellboy at the Hotel !
Morrison, Chicago, during the month of i
June, IS9X.
"One day in June," he said, "a gentle- ;
man in room 131 asked me if I would be
at leisure to go to the stockyards with
him. I went out there with him and
helped to carry two boxes. He went out
to see some man about meat, he told me.
We took the boxes and went to a car
where there were three or four rows of
meat. In each of the boxes there were ,
four smaller packages, containing, v I
recall it, a black or rather a light gray
colored substance. He put this into per
forated trays made for that purpose, set
fire to it and placed it under the meat. I
asked him what that was done for and he
.'â¢v.id it was done as an experiment to pre- j
serve the moat. Next day 1 was to go
back and get the cans.
"I asked himvwhether it was to kill I
germs or anything* like that, but he said
no, simply to preserve the meat. I put
my finger on the matt and tasted it. and â 
it burned the end Vof my tongue. I i
called attention to theVaet that the meat i
looked rather larger tfflyj when we were!
there before. He said trÃPt was simply
an enlargement of the meat from the ice. i
There was a sulphurous smell in the car
and another odor, which I cannot de- i
scribe. I took the cans back to the hotel. |
"I noticed in one end of the car there !
was a card marked 'Tampa, Fla.' This
was at Armour's packing house. There j
was only one car and only about three !
rows of beef. I think it was halves. I ;
asked him who he was, and. if 1 am not !
mistaken, he told me he was a quarter- .
master or a quartermaster general, or i
something like that. He was about 6
feet 10 inches tall, wore eyeglasses, and,
1 should judge, was about 45 years of !
age. He wore no uniform, but was
dressed in plain clothes. I understood !
from what he said that he had some con
noction with the military service."
Dr. E. E. Murdock. who was for two
years president of the auxiliary medical
staff in the Chicago Health Department,
and iÂ« an analytical chemist. st:itod that s
h<> had made several examinations of
both canned and refrigerated beef, dating
back several years. In the latter part of ',
June, IK<S, he said, some canned meat was
brought to him to determine its charac- i
ter. He found that the meat was appar- '
ently boiled beef. It probably had been '
boiled before it was sealed in the can and
Bomewbat after. There was in the can ;
quite a quantity of common salt and also j
nitrate of potash, otherwise salt;
These preservations, said the witness, I
must have been in the can before the !
boiling was complete, because th^y had '
saturated the fiber of the meat and har
dened it.
"Have you ever found horseflesh put up
in cans and sold on the market here in |
i :hioago?"
"Not put up in cans, but I have had !
samples brought to me purporting to be i
fresh beef from the market, and have
found some of these samples to be horse- |
flesh instead of beef. I had no means of I
knowing whence they came. An investi- i
! gation with that result once led the |
Health Department to suppress an estab
lishment in the outskirts of Chicago."

ALAMEDA SCHOOLS PRAISED.
Marin County Teachers Pleased With
Their Excursion.
SAN RAFAEL, March 22.â The third
day's session of the Marin County Teach
ers' Institute opened with music under
ttv direction of Miss Edwina Dufflcy,
which was followed by the reports of the
committees that visited the Alameda pub
lic schools. Discussion of these reports
was conducted by Professor T. L. Hea
ton. The teachers were a unit in the
opinion that the Alameda schools were
conducted on the most approved modern
plan and that the pupils attending them
had every facility for acquiring a sound,
practical education. The discipline in
vogue was highly commended. A vote of
thanks was tendered Superintendent Sul
livan for the reception and banquet ac
corded the teachers.
Professor Heaton read an interesting
paper on "The Laws of Our Language.
Grammarâ lts Aim and Scope." Dr. El
mer E. Brown discoursed on ''An and
Education." Both papers were discussed
by the institute.
At the afternoon session Professor Hea
ton spoke on "Aims and Methods of Dis
cipline." Dr. Brown on "The Social As
pect of Education." Among those to tak-?
an active part in to-morrow's exercises
are Miss Kathryn E. Stone and Profes
sor Elwood P. Cubberley.
WATER COMPANY'S PLEDGE.
WATSONVILLE. March 22.â At a meet
ing of the City Trustees to-day the prop
osition was submitted by Francis Smith,
representing the "tt'atsonvllle Water and
Light Company, that the corporation will
supply the city of Watsonville free water
for all public purposes, to include water
for street sprinkling and fire use, and
also will supply 15,000 gallons daily for the
sewer system that the city Intends build
ing. The proposition was made on con
dition that the Trustees abandon the in
tention to vote bonds for a water system.
The process of
canning meat to
day robs it of all nu
trition, leaving noth
ing but fiber, fat and
gelatine in the can.
I consider it entirely
unfit for human
food. The Govern
ment chemist de
scribes it as a mass
of insoluble mat
ter. In the packing
house this insolu
ble matter would
come under the
head of tankage,
and would be used
as a fertilizer. â Ex
pert testimony that
was barred by the
Beef Court of In
quiry.
F, acting sergeant major of the Second
Battalion, testified that at Jacksonville
the refrigerated beef had to be frequent
ly rejected; it looked good, but when cut
open it had a peculiar odor, a nauseous
stench. On one occasion a French beef
stow was served and immediately there
after the entire company was taken vio
lently sick with vomiting and diarrhea.
For two weeks afterward three men out
of the company was the maximum fit for
duty. Within six weeks three men died,
and' although the records showed they
died from lever, witness said he knew
that the sickness from this meat was
what killed them. This meat had to be
brought two miles and a half from the I
point of issue, which took about half an j
hour. An investigation was made of the ]
beef which made the company sick, but j
with what result witness could not say.
Dr. John G. Burne of Chicago, who was j
assistant surgeon of the Second Illinois
Volunteers while the regiment was at
Jacksonville, stated that he had con
demned the refrigerator beef several
times before it left the wagon which
brought it. He had also returned some
of it to the cars, taking it back in
wagons and telling the agent of Swift &
Co. that he could not use it. He had re
fused the meat seven times in one month
on account of the bad odor and bad taste.
The men complained bitterly that they
could not eat it.
Colonel Davis asked: "Had you occa
sion to believe or suspect that the Swift
refrigerated beef had been chemically ,
treated with a view to its 'preserva-' 1
tlon'?"
"That had never been suggested to me,
but it occurred to me when I used It.
The only ground I had for that belief
was the difference In its taste and it? np
pearance after it had been removed from
the car. It had a deadened, peculiar ap
pearanre and I wondered whether any
chemicals had hern usÂ» â !. "
First Lieutenant Hedekin of the Third
Cavalry testified that the principal meat
ration *In Cuba was refrigerated berf.
The complaint against it was that it was
rotten.
Colonel Davis asked the witness if he
had reason to believe or suspect that
chemicals had been u?ed in preserving
the refrigerated beef. He replied:
"The night after I joined my troop re
frigerator beef appeared on the table In
the form of steak. That was the first
I had seen. T'pon tasting It I remarked
that it had a peculiar taste, which 1 had
never noticed before. I ate very heartily
of it. That night I had diarrhea which
developed shortly afterward into dysen
tery, and I was unable to ascribe the
disease to any other cause."
"What led you to ascribe the peculiar
ity to preservatives?"
"The fact that the meat was different
from any that I had ever tasted and that
It made" me sick."
W. A. Robinson, traveling representa
tive of the chemical firm of Charles Pfizer
& Co., New York, testified that he for
merly had solicited orders and sold chem
icals to the packing trade. The witness
said it was within his knowledge that his
firm sells to packing houses large quan
Smith was asked in regard to rates for
domestic purposes and said they would
remain the same as they were at present.
The proposition was to hold good for live
years. The matter will come up for final
consideration at the meeting next Tues
day evening.
HAWAII TO HAVE
NAVAL MILITIA
An Officer May Be Sent to the Islands
to Instruct the New
Organization.
NEW YORK. March 22.â A Washington
special to the Tribune says: Hawaii is to j
have a naval militia organization similar
to the auxiliary forces possessed by many
of the States, which were so valuable in
the recent Spanish war. Secretary Long
received a letter on the subject to-day
from J. B. Castle, who was Hawaiian
secretary of legation at Washington be
fore annexation was accomplished, ask- j
ing for all necessary regulations regard-
Ing the militia in order that steps could
be taken at once at Honolulu to perfect \
an organization.
The Navy Department is highly grati
fied with the prospect of such a reserve j
force in the mid-Pacific, as Mr. Castle I
and the Hawailans interested with him
propone to establish, especially as it is
imposlble to maintain as large a regular
naval force there at present as the im
portance of the locality would justify, did
Admiral Dewey not require so many yes- ;
f=>]s in the Philippines. It is expected ;
that a naval officer will soon be spared
to undertake the instruction of the Ha
walian battalion in technical matters, I
drills and routine ship life, and If pos-
Bible a monitor or gunboat will be as
signed to the battalion for cruising duty, i

the Nicaraguan coast. The main item
bearing on American interests is the ap
pointment of General Torres to command
the department including Bluefields. Tor
res is an avowed enemy of Americans,
anc" for his part in aiding the escape of
Arguillo, who murdered an American
Citizen, the United States forced his re
moval from the governorship four years
ago.
The commission to revise the tariff has
not yet reported and Torres' influence is
likely to make the work abortive. He
has already thrown revolutionary' sus
pects into jail, and says he will sift the
uprising to the bottom. The Government
has ordered the estates of General Reves
confiscated. His plantations and cattle
were sold to Warren Brown of Buckport,
Maine, who protests against the seizure,
having made the purchase in good faith
Nicaragua, however, claims that titles
executed during a revolution are illegal.

' titles of boracic acid and other chemi
cals, but that so far as he knew such
chemicals -were never applied to fresh
beefâ they were used for export pork.
Horace" C. Gardner of Swift & Co.. re
called, gave a detailed list of the various
chemicals used In the different depart
ments of that . establishment. He said
that in the refrigerated beef department
no chemicals of any kind are used and
that he never knew of salicylic acid be
ing used on the premises for any purpose.
Albert G. Manns, the chemist for Ar
mour & Co.. testified that a large num
ber of chemicals were used in the manu
facturing department, but none in the
packing house except borax and boracic
add, which were used in packing some
goods for the foreign markets.
The witness stated that the refrigerated
beef sent to the army was shipped in the
usual way and that no chemicals were
used on It.
In reply to Colonel Davis the witness
said he had seen what is called "preserv
aline" and had analyzed it. Its main in
gredient was borax and it was used for
preserving vegetables, milk, cheese, but
ter, etc.
John Blerma, private in Company E.
First Illinois Volunteers, afterward as
signed to a provisional battalion of engi
neers for duty in Porto Rico, testified
next. In all cases, he said, the men in
his battalion refused to eat the canned j
roast beef unless absolutely driven to It. j
They said it was unpalatable, their stom- j
achs rebelled against it and they were i
attacked with vomiting after eating it j
In Porto Rico the men very seldom ate j
the canned beef w T hllc their money last- |
cd. The surgeon told the men that the j
refrigerated beef was unfit to eat and j
that he could not do anything with his
medicines as long as they were com
pelled to eat it; he also condemned the
canned beef.
W. Clark Marshall said he had been a j
specialist in meat provisions since 1848,
although he had not been in any of the
establishments in seven or eight years.
"Please explain the nature and char
acter of your experience with reference j
to canned meat, more particularly to j
roast beef, so called," said Major Lee.
"1 have investigated and experimented
in the matter since 1848. The process of
canning meat to-day robs it of all nutri
tion, leaving nothing but fiber, fat and
j gelatine in the can. I consider it entirely
! unlit for human food. The Government
chemist describes it as a mass of insolu
ble matter. In the packing houses in
soluble matter would come under the
head of tankage and would be used as a
fertilizer. There are thousands of ex
periments in all colleges, known to all
scientists, to show that animals fed with
it will starve to death. Canned corned
beef "
Colonel Davis said: "I object to any
testimony from this witness which does
not relate strictly to the objects of the
inquiry."
Major Lee replied: "I believe that at
; times the questions of the recorder have
j gone outside the subjects of the inquiry.
! I wish the witness, of course, to keep
; within bounds."
In reply to Major Lee the witness said
that hf knew where O'Malley's slaughter
house used to be located. He also knew
of a herd of thirty or forty condemned
cattle being driven there for slaughter.
He saw some of these cattle the next day
!in a city market. He knew of the car
casses going afterward to a canning es
tablishment. He would not give the
name of the concern unless the firm de
-1 sired It. The cattle had pleuro-pneumo
' nia. This occurred eighteen months be
fore Dr. Devoe took charge of the Bureau
of Animal Industry at the stockyards.
"How long will canned roast beef
keep?"'
'â¢If properly canned it will keep for
'â¢ twenty years."
The witness stated that the present pro
cess robbed the meat of Its nutrition, and !
the sterilizing feature of it generated a '
gas which tainted the meat.
"Is fresh beef prior to or during ship
ments directly or indirectly treated with
any chemicals?"
"A man would be a fool if he did not
treat It chemically under ordinary regis
tration, because meat going from here to
'. London could not be sent under the or
dinary temperature of an icehouse with
out having on its arrival a deposit of at
mospheric germs and the meat would be
unsalable in London."
Witness did not think there was any
harm in so treating beef if it were done
intelligently.
Captain R. H. Wainwright of the First
United States Cavalry said that in Cuba
there was no complaint by his men about
the so-called canned roast beef. It was
generally eaten by them. There was gen
eral dissatisfaction, however, with it on
account of its unpalatableness and non
appetizing qualities.
The last witness examined In Chicago
i was Lewis H. Wilson, who served' with
the Seventh company of the Volunteer
Signal Corps in Porto Rico. He stated
that on all occasions the men in his com:
-: pany complained of the canned roast beef
as nauseating, unpalatable and entirely
unfit to eat. No more than 10 per cent
of that Issued to his company was con
sumed.
The members of the court left for the

WIFE AND DAUGHTER
NEARLY ASPHYXIATED
Joseph Becker Beturns to His Home
on McAllister Street Just in
Time to Save His Family.
Joseph Becker, employed as a bartender
by Dick Carr, on Montgomery street, re
turned late last night to his rooms In a
lodging-house at 100 McAllister street and
' found his wife and ten-year-old daughter
i Lizzie in an unconscious condition, the re
; suit of escaping gas. Becker immediately
: threw open the windows and dragged the
semi-lifeless bodies into the hail.
Becker states that before leaving his
; home this morning he detected the odor
of gas and notified the landlord. The
latti r gave the assurance that the matter
' would be attended to and Becker thought
' nothing more about it. Last evening,
i however, when he returned from his work
: he met another tenant of the house, who
j had perceived the same odor anl who
; had Just visited the basement with the
; Intention of turning the flow off at the
meter.
When Becker became acquainted with
this fact he immediately realized that the
landlord- had ignored his warning given
: hours before, and he rushed to the room
whore his wife and daughter were sleep
'â  ing. only to find them fast becoming vic
tims of the deadly fumes. Both were
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
Drs. Tormey and Runnel] administered
copious draughts of oxygen, finally re
storing them to a conscious condition.
Had Becker made the discovery a little
: later it is probable that his family would
i have been asphyxiated. The fact that
i they had been sleeping but a short time
| was also In their favor. Becker is well
â¢ known, having managed the Olympic
I Club bar for many years.

UPROAR IN THE
MISSOURI HOUSE
Bitter Words Exchanged
by Lawmakers.
ALMOST COME TO BLOWS
OPEN CHARGES OF DISHONEST
VOTING.
The Trouble Arises Over the Bill De
signed to Regulate Charges
in the Stock
Yards.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, March 22.â A special to
the Republic from Jefferson City, Mo.,
says: The bill to regulate stockyard
charges caused furious excitement in
to-night's session of the House. Charges
of dishonest voting were openly made
and pandemonium reigned, at times so
furious that it seemed probable the
members would come to blows. The
object of the bill is to reduce yardage
and other charges from 20 to 50 per cent.
It is said to be a duplicate of the Kan
sas law.
The bill was placed on Its passage
during the early part of the session and
defeated â ayes 51, noes 67.
Mr. Bohart of Clintcm moved to re- i
consider the vote by which the bill j
had failed to pass and his opening sen
tence was:
"Honest men and honest legislation
have no place in the Missouri Legis
lature."
'"If the gentleman from Clinton
means to insinuate that undue influ
ence caused a majority of the House
to vote against the bill, he says what
he knows is false," retorted Mr. Jones
of Ho well.
Mr. Cleary of Kansas City said he
regarded the remarks of Mr. Bohart as
the ravings of a misguided youth. Im
mediately the House was in an uproar
and some personal encounters were
narrowly averted.
With fifteen or twenty members
clamoring for recognition, some one
moved to table the motion to recon
sider, which, had it carried, would have
killed the bill. The motion was put
and lost; yeas, 51; nays, 69.
Before any further move could be
made a motion to adjourn prevailed.
Under the rules the bill must be voted
upon to-morrow.

An Agent of the Latter Is Quietly
Buying Up Bonds and Expects .
to Get Possession of :
the Road.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. March 22.â At noon
on Tuesday next the Mount Lowe Ital)
--way property will be sold under fore
closure proceedings by Court Commis
sioner Henry Newby. For many months
Arthur B. Cody of Chicago has been
buying bonds at a price never" abovft
2~ 1 i cents on the dollar. Cody is a
member of the protective committee,
the other members being P. M. Green,
Andrew McNally, J. S. Torrance and JÂ»
D. Pope. Through this committee pro
ceedings in foreclosure were begun in
June, 1897, and the decree was granted
in October of the same year, the aale
subject to twenty days' notice. Since
then the bondholders have not been
idle and the holdings have been con
centrated in the hands of Cody and
those whom he represents, principally'
the Singer heirs of Chicago. Valentine
Peyton, a capitalist of Danville, 111.,
is advancing money for the purchasers.
He is in Pasadena and will likely be
the purchaser under foreclosure.
The Southern Pacific owns $25,000 in
bonds and did not come into the pool
of the protective committee. It is ex
peÂ« ted in some quarters that the road
will bid actively.
The Huntington syndicate controls
the Pasadena and Los Angeles electric
line and it has ever been an open ques
tion whether the street railway corpora
tion has not had an eye on the Mount
Lowe road as an adjunct. Peyton de
clares his interests are not linked with
those of Huntington.
To make the line profitable and stable
a right of way 200 feet wide on Govern
ment land, from Echo Mountain to the
summit of Mount Lowe, had to be ob
tained. The last Congress enacted a
law granting this, with 160 acres addi
tional on the summit of the mountain,
as the railroad was simply a squatter
on the public domain. That legislation
was the culmination of the efforts of
those who expect to become absolute
owners of the property.

WORK ON THE
GAP IS NOW
BEING RUSHED
Men and Materials to
the Front.
BENEFIT TO SANTA BARBARA
WILL BE REACHED IN TWELVE
HOURS.
Curves Being Eliminated, Grades
Modified and Heavier Rails Be
ing Laid on the Coast
Division Line.
Every energy is being exercised by the- j
Southern Pacific Company to close the j
E5-mile gap on the coast division line be- ;
tween Surf and Elwood, and to get this
route In operation as part of onÂ© of its
through overland lines.
To make this line available in the high
est degree for this purpose much remains
to be done. Right of way must be se
cured for the proposed short bay shore
line between this city and San Mateo, J
by means of which the steep grade by i
way or' Valencia street will be avoided, j
Most of this rlg-ht of way has been se
cured, but a IV â¢â  nig links must
yet be obtained. Then the grading and j
rail laying must be done, but this is ex
pected to be done in a short time, once
.h-- right of way question is settled.
Large forces of men have been and are i
: work along the line between Sole- !
â  lad and Santa Margarita, straightening i
out numer ma curves, modifying grades,
and laying 9<.Â»-pound rails in place, of the
lighter ones used when the road was
originally built. But all this is merely pre
liminary to the great task of bridging the i i
gap.
Stone & McMurtrie, the contractors ' (
who have in hand the last mentioned i
piece of work, are rushing all the men.
they can obtain to the front, and within ! '
a few weeks gangs of them will be strung I
- 'h>- proposed line grading, putting ,(
up bridges, viaducts ami trestles and lay- ;
ing rails. At Honda, five miles below ! (
Surf, the present torminus of the road, ;
a big bridge is to be placed. The mate
rials for it are nearly all on the scene, â¢ '
Two long and expensive viaducts are also i
to be built between Honda and Elwood, i (
and the material for these will be avail
able as soon as construction trains are t
running to the points where they are to
be erected.
The ten-mil** spur that is being built i '
from Surf to Lnmpoc is progressing rap- '
idly, and the railroad officials expect it {
to be in active operation within sixty
days. As soon as this branch is turned i
over to the operating department the men
now employed on it will be transferred
to the gap. i
With the completion of the coast line
as a through route no town on it will i
probably benefit more than Santa Bar
bara. It now takes from twenty-seven t
to twenty-seven and one-half hours to
there by rail from San Francisco, t
Including a four to five hour lay-over at '
Saugus, the distance by way of Saugus
being 530 miles. By the direct line by way i
of the present "gap" the distance will be
reduced to 370 miles, and the running (
time will be twelve hours. This great
difference In time will be made possible j
not alone by the shortening of the dis
tance. but by the great difference In the
grades over the Tehachapl and over the <
Lucia Mountains in favor of the
latter. . i â 
NO FEES FOB JURORS.
Cannot Be Collected in This City Un
der the Statutes.
An important decision relative to the â 
payment of fees? for the attendance of ! ;
Jurors upon the Superior Court was ren- I '
dered yesterday by the Supreme Court. \ ;
In 1597 Samuel H. Hilton served twenty | :
days as a juror and demanded of County j i
Clerk Curry a certificate stating that he ! â¢
was entitled to $40. computed at the rate â¢ '
of $2 per day. The demand was refused j j
and mandamus proceedings were begun, i
resulting in a judgment for Hilton. '
Curry appealed and the judgment was j .
reversed by the higher court yesterday. â¢
In the first place, so the Supreme Court ,
pays, jt was not alleged that there Is any ;
statute directing the County Clerk to is- ! ,
sue such a certificate, although It was
shown that this waa nc-cessary, as the
Board of- Supervisors refused to recognize
the demand unless accompanied by such
a certificate. The main point, however, '
is the right of a juror to compensation
for such service. The court holds that
Buch a right would be purely statutory
tind that the amount of compensation and
the mode of payment rests with the
Legislature.
Th<> court says: "There has never been :
any statute in this State authorizing the
payment of any portion of a juror's fees
in San Francisco out of the public treas
ury. â¢ Â» â¢ We hold, therefore, that the
provisions in the act of February 27,
3566. for the morle in which jurors' fees
shall be paid were not repealed by the act
of lS9ri. and that as there are no pro- .
visions in the statutes making the pay- â 
ment of jurors' fees in San Francisco a
charge upon the public treasury' the peti
tioner was nor entitled to the certificate '
asked for."
Merchants Grateful for Rain.
There was a large attendance of busl
ness men In the Cbambi r of c'nmmerce '
yesterday at the noon hour. The object ;
of their presence was the third day's
Lenten devotion which is being conducted
vi this hour daily by the Brotherhood of j
St. Andrew. The exorcises were conduct- '
t*d by Frank Southack, a young business
man of the city, who read from tho
scriptures and led the merchants in pray
er and song. An address on the ten com
mandments wa? delivered by John w\
Wood, general secretary of the St. An
drew Brotherhood of New York. At the
conclusion of the address Major W. H. '
Hooper said: "Now that there are repre-
Fentatives here from every parish in the
city, Including the head of the church.
What is wanted of soap
for the skin is to wash it

TRAGEDIES OF THE RACE
TRACKS BEARING FRUIT
Tuesday's Murder Arouses Residents on the
East Shore to Protest Against
the Evil.
THE latest tragedy due to the per
nicious influence of the race
track has aroused the residents
of Emeryville, and, In fact, of
the entire eastern shore of the bay
from Oakland to Berkeley to a full
realization of the plague-spot in their
midst. Three murders in two years,
to say nothing of the ruined fortunes
and blighted hopes attributable to the
evil, seems to have awakened the re
spectable element, for yesterday there
was practically a unanimity of senti
ment that steps should be taken to
abolish the evil.
James J. Gilligan, the young slayer
of Jockey Epperson, was removed to
Oakland yesterday and is now con
fined In the Alameda County Jail. In
appearance Gilligan is a typical prod
uct of the race course. Born and
reared in this city, about his earliest
recollections nre of the old Bay Dis
trict track. It might, wfth propriety,
be said that he grew up in the stable
and paddock. He is inoffensive in
manner, dull of wit, without ambition
to become anything better than a
stable boy. Entirely self-possessed,
he manifests little regret for the post

FISHING FOR CHARITY
AGAINST THEIR WILL
State Officers Knock the Profits of
the Toilers of the Inland Sea.
IN the upper part of San Pablo
Bay the fishermen are weeping
and wailing and indulging In the
choicest cuss words of half a
dozen foreign languages and such
American profanity as their knowl
edge of the tongue permits. After
two weeks' hard work buffeting
wind, waves and storm they have
just learned that their labors have
been without gain to themselves,
and that the poor and orphaned of
two counties have been growing fat
on fish that the fishers valued at
nearly two bits a pound. In other
words, they have been fishing for
charityâ and did not know it. Hence
their anger.
The laws of the State make it un
lawful to catch striped bass under
three pounds in weight, but the
high price of these fish Induces the
fisherman to run the risk of arrest
and the confiscation of the catch.
Since the present storm has been
on the run of small bass has been
very large In San Pablo Bay, and
the netmen from the upper waters
of that body have worked hard to
take adavntage of the run. It is
almost Impossible to catch them
breaking the law, for the first sight
of the State Fish Commission launch
Quinnat causes the lawbreakers to
signal to their comrades and the
evidence of guilt is quickly disposed
of. The next best thing for the
deputies of the commission to do is
to seize the fish as they nrrlve from
the several railroad stations along
the Contra Costa shore. This has
been done with a vengeance, for
during the- past ten days over 1300
pounds of the prohibited fish have
been seized. As these cannot be
sold the Commissioners have sent
seizures to the Protestant, Hebrew
and Catholic orphan asylums and
almshouses in this city and Oak
land, where the delicacy has been
much appreciated by the inmates.
Meanwhile the tollers of the la

and no concern for the future. His
vocabulary is of the track and seem
ingly limited to that and a few
phrases of the street. He never vol
unteers a statement, and answers all
questions put to him in the fewest
possible words; yet he answers ques-
tlons concerning the killing of Epper
son as willingly as he does on any
other topic.
Twice yesterday Gilligan manifest
ed a trace of interest in his surround
ings. Once was when he asked when
the Inquest on Epperson would be
held, and being told that It would
probably be this evening, followed it
with another query as to when his
examination would take place. The
second time was when The Call artist
had finished a sketch of him, for
which Gilligan readily consented to
pose. The prisoner expressed a curi
osity to see what he looked like, but
made no sign of approval or disap
proval of the work.
This man, who bears the reputation
of being one of the quietest of the
race track hangers-on, is one of the
army that has been transplanted to
Emeryville through the agency of the
racing game, and one of the army
that flourished at Ingleside prior to
the prohibition of the disreputable
methods that prevailed there. It is
his kind that maintains such deadfalls
as the Office saloon, where the trag
edy occurred. It is not surprising

ask the Bishop to return thanks to God."
The idea was accepted, and Bishop Nich

while dreams of wealth In the form,
of cheeks from their consignees
have floated across their minds.
That they did not know of the seiz
ures of their fish is accounted for
by the fact that all of them live
near the head of the upper bay and
they only go to the Postofflce about
once a week for the returns from
thr-lr catches. The returns were due
about this time of the week and
since Tuesday the fishers have been
arriving at their homes near Marti
nez, where the news of their mis
fortune was first learned. They at
once recognized the handiwork of
Deputy John Davis, whom they call
"Johna Davia," and he has come in
for the bulk of their cussing.
"Johna Davia, he steala th' fish, I
losa th' nvona. Saparasta sa cres
ta" Is the way they pay it.
that the respectable people deem it
time that all should be driven from
their midst.
Gilligan still maintains that he acted
entirely In self-defense, and so far the
Oakland police have discovered noth
ing to disprove'his claim. He reiter
ates his first statement of the inci
dents leading up to the cutting, and
says he never had any trouble with
Epperson prior to Tuesday evening,
when he started with a friend for the
train and the jockey attempted to
take his friend away from him. Ep
person and Gilligan had a fight, In
proof of which Gilligan displays a
badly cut ear and one or two minor
marks on his face. Epperson, he says,
threatened to kill him, but he made
his escape and went into the Office
saloon. Epperson followed him, and
fearing he intended to carry out his
threat, Gilligan picked up a small
bread knife lying on a shelf. Epper
â on again attacked him and got him
down on the floor, when he used the
knife.
Gilligan's story differs in several
particulars from the statements of
eye witnesses, but it is noticeable that
the latter versions are even more
favorable to him than his own story.
Gilligan, in tolling of his past, said
he had been arrested once in this city
for "too much boor," as he put It. but
he denied having been implicated in
any serious trouble before. Several
of his companions at the track visited
him in Jail yesterday and took him a
substantial dinner, which hf> disposed
of with keen relish. His friends have
also engaged an attorney for him.
Epperson's remains are at the
Morgue in Oakland. The inquest will
be held this evening.

gave the assemblage his benediction.
Gamage Surrendered Himself.
Jule C. Gamage, president and manager
of the Harding Collection Agency, Bur
rendered himself to Captain Bohen at
police headquarters yestercfay and was
taken to the City Prison, where a charge j
of manslaughter was booked against him.
He was released on his own recognizance
by Judge Mogan. As related exclusive- j
ly in The Call, Gamage, while driving
a buggy round the corner of Market and I
O'Farrell streets Tuesday night, knocked ;
down Isaac R. Jones, a well-known lot
tery-ticket seller, who died a few hours j
later at the Receiving Hospital.

GROWTH OF THE
CITY RETARDED
BY CEMETERIES
Statistics for the Su
pervisors.
AN EFFORT TO CLOSE THEM
STAETLING FIGURES GIVEN TO
SUPPORT A PETITION.
Representatives of the Burial Places
Affirm That Any Steps Taken
Should Be for Their
Removal.
Startling statistics as to the cause of
the slow growth of this city and also as
to the high death rate were presented to
the members of the Health and Police
Committee of the Supervisors yesterday
when its members heard the petition of
the Western Addition Development Club
that an ordinance be passed prohibiting
burial of the dead within the city limits
after January 1, 1902.
E. P. E. Troy, vice president of the
Richmond Improvement Club, in his ar
gument in support of the petition, dwelt
chiefly upon the effect of the cemeteries
in retarding the growth of the city to
the westward. He said that a conserva
tive estimate, made by people competent
to Judge, placed the increase of popula
tion in this city during the past ten years
at not over 25,000. This, in a population
of 300,000, he held to bo a small percent
age. Contrasted with this he cited Marin
County. He told of the enormous in
crease in population of Mill Valley, Sau
salito and San Rafael. He claimed the
latter had trebled its population in a few !
years. Alameda County presented the I
same state of affairs. Its population, he i
said, had increased 150,000 in the last dec- !
ade, while some of its small towns had
ten times as many inhabitants as they
had ten years ago.
This condition Mr. Troy attributed
solely to the cemeteries and their blight
ing effect. The people who were building
across the bay were the ones who would
choose the Western Addition for their
homes if all conditions # were favorable.
He said the present yovement was not
one in which it was Urtended to move the
dead. He favored Jfeaving the dead un
disturbed, but to jmt a stop to further
interments. Tha/speaker dwelt on the !
temptation to -wTiich officers of cemetery
associations were exposed, chief among ,
which was that of overselling the ground i
under their control. This led to burials ',
too near the surface and other evils. He
drew attention to the fact that burials
were double those of births and that the f
death rate was double that of any other
city m America.
John Henderson, secretary of the club
petitioning for the closing of the ceme
teiies, was the first protestant heard. He
said the petition was presented in good
faith: that the club had been organized i
fur the purpose of improving the West
ern Addition and to develop that portion
of the city. He said there were only two
outlets to the city, and one of those was
out Point Lobos avenue, which passed be
tween two cemeteries. This prevented the
natural development of that part of the
city. He said Ricnmond was a suburb of
San Francisco, instead of a part of It. uja
it should be. It was separated from the
city proper by a line of tombstones.
Dr. Cross followed, taking for his theme
the question of sanitation. He Bald a
fight similar to the one he and his as
sociates were making had been made in
every city in the world. He counseled
that in consideration of the disposal of
the dead the committee should not be
swayed by sentiment. He told of the
various diseases that might be spread
about, especially through the seepage
that polluted the water used for drink
ing purposes. The first thought should
be for the living, and not for the dead,
he said.
J. H. McKnlght, with Attorneys Cres
well, Gould and Hubbs, ail spoke in fa
vor of the petition.
Superintendent George R. Fletcher of
the Odd Fellows' Cemetery was the only
speaker against the proposed ordinance.
although officials were present represent
ing all the parties at interest. Mr. Fletch
er said the people of this city had not
asked that the cemeteries be closed. He
held that the Board of Health was the
proper body, and that Its members would
without doubt recommend the closing of
the cemeteries if they were a menace to
public health. In answer to the assertion
of the high death rate, he said the ward
in which the cemeteries are located Is.
according to the statistics of the Board
of Heaith, the healthiest in all the city.
He did not use it in his argument, but
it Is affirmed that the explanation of the
high death rate here is the fact that i
many people come from the interior to
the hospitals of this city for treatment :
and die here. This shows a death rate i
out of all proportion m the number of i
inhabitants of the city. Mr. Fletcher held i
that any legislation directed at the cemr- !
teries should be for their removal, and |
not merely to close them. This mea"nt
a confiscation of the property of all per-
Bons owning plots there, as they could :
not use them for the purpose for which !
they were originally purchased. The mem
bers of the Health and Police Commit
tee decided to hear further argument
before making any recommendation to i
the Supervisors. Chairman Collins pre- !
sided, the others present being Supervis- j
ors Att ridge and Phelps.

In these regions. Young Earl Stimpson |
had the mount and rode like a veteran. .
Getting away from the post fifth, he grad- i
bally closed on Solace, which beat the ,
' gate, and won hands down.
Mainbar, ridden by Ellis and 12 to 1 in j
the ring, splashed in ahead of his field j
in the first event decided, a sprint over !
the Futurity course. Cavallo took the |
place, beating New Moon a head. The fa- i
vorite, Pat Murphy, found the route too j
far.
The seven-furlong selling run went to j
the lukewarm favorite Castake. piloted j
by Eddie Jones. Second to Jim Brownell I
into the stretch, he then took the front j
position, winning easily from Heigh Ho. i
Pat Morrissey proved a wonder in the j
sloppy footing. Backed from twos to 11 i
to 10 to win the mile and a sixteenth run, !
Spencer took him out in front and fairly |
spreadeagled his company, leading Red j
Glenn over the. line by fifteen lengths in J
1:48%, a remarkably fast performance.

Many thought Jinks capable of giving |
Montgomery an argument in the six-fur- j
long spin that followed, but she made a
signal failure of it. Jones handled her j
to poor advantage and finished third. ;
Montgomery winning about as he pleased !

KNIGHTS OF HONOR.
They Increase the Per Capita Tax,
Install Their New Officers
and Adjourn.
The Grand Lodge of . the Knights of
Honor held its second session yesterday
iTnd concluded its labors. The principal
business at the morning session was the
adoption of the report of the special com
mittee on the extension of the order. This
suggested ways and moans by which the
order car. be extended and it provides
that the per capita tax be fixed at $2 a
year instead of $1 25. and that the pay
ment of such tax be in four quarterly
installments Instead of seml-annually, as
In the past. It also provides that 30 per
cent of the amount so realized be ex
pended exclusively in the work of secur
ing new members. The attention of the
grind officers is directed to the southern
part of the State as a field in which to
advance the order.
In the afternoon there came, up the elec
tion of the grand officers and after nom
inations ballots were taken with the fol
lowing result: Grand dictator P. L. Ar
chibald (re-elected* ; vice dictator. Charles
H Holcornb; assistant dictator. Ben I.
Salomon: reporter. Thomas Johnstone (re
elected by the unanimous vote of the
body); treasurer, F. W. Zehfus (re-elect
ed)" chaplain G. A. "Wanamaker; guide.
C A. Garthorne: guardian. W. S. Lane:
sentinel. H. L. Farrier: trusteesâ A. M.
McPherson. E. F. Joy and Charles Lampe:
supreme representativesâ M. L. Crowe
and Charles F. Curry; alternatesâ A. H.
Voight and Harry J. Lask.
The great contest of the day was on
supreme representatives and the closest
fight was between Curry and Voight. Sev
eral ballots were taken before the prize
went to Curry-
Fred Raabe was named for the office of
grand guide, but he declined./
The new officers were installed by "W.H.
Barnes, acting supreme dictator; Harry
J. I,aisk as supreme guide and J. W.
Rourke as past supreme dictator.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1899.
McCOY FEELS LIKE
A SURE WINNER
The "Kid" Rests at Ease, Confident
of the Outcome,
K1O" McCOY is now resting at ease. Up has finished his road exercise
and th-> punching: bap. -which has- resounded so many times in the past
few week? each time the "KM" tapped it with his mitts, is now as silent
aa -, dam at low tide. McCoy "is In the pink of condition." He
scales 158 pounds and will doubtless go Into the ring weighing about 165
pounds.
Joe Ohoynski, his prospective opponent, has also quit training and is as
fit as a fiddle to go a lons Journey. The betting Is 10 to 5V4, with Choynski
on the short erxl. but it can !>Â« safely snid that Choynski'a stock will take a
sudden jump upward this evening, as there are many dollars waiting to be
placed on the California when the name of the referee is made public. The
conditions of the light have already been mad.- public The referee must de
clare a winner, even though the battle runs on to the final or limit round.
If the contest goes the limit doubtless McCoy will win on points. Choynski'a
only hope Is In scoring a knork-out, at which pane he is very expert. .The
club managers are highly pleased with the sale of reserved seats, which, up
to last evening, amounted to $10,000.

During the running of the recent indoor
'â¢ tournament at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion snnif of the prominent members of
the Olympic Club Wheelmen came to the
conclusion that the track then erected in
the Pavilion would just about tit in tho

ized among themselves a racing commit
tee, purchased the track and It is now

LEAGUE SEASON AT HAND.
Everything in Readiness for the
Popping of Base Hits.
Interest in the opening of the baseball
season next Sunday is rapidly developing,
and this season bids fair to be the m >st
successful that California has seen for
years. The members of all the clubs
have reported for practice and the teams
are out daily hard at work in preliminary
practice getting rid of the kinks in their
arms that have developed during the
winter's idleness. The weather has mili
tated against outdoor work during the
last week, but nevrrtheless the teams
will line up in pretty fair shape next
Sunday, as many of the players
have tnkpn to indoor exercise, hand
ball being resorted to in a great measure
to rid themselves of superfluous flesh. The
nines have been greatly strengthened
over last season, the weak spots being re
placed by imported Eastern players. In
tact, all the clubs have resorted to Im
portations save the Friscos, all the num
bers of the local team having been born
and raised in this city with on exception.
From a casual observation it would
appear that the home team is strong in
batteries and hitting, and if the members'
fielding proves equal to their hitting they
may be counted on being a formidable
factor in the fight for the pennant.
The San Franclscos and Oaklands will
| be the contending clubs here next Sunday
i and both teams will appear In new and !
handsome uniforms, the San v ranciscos* j
â¢ colors being solid black with ' orange i
' trimmfriKS and white-coat.- Oakland will 7
be arrayed in colors of gray with maroon |
trimmings and maroon coat.
President Moran has appointed his
corps of umpires, having named Reub
: Levy, Jack Donahue and Dave Creamer i
â  for these responsible positions. The ur- j

IS THE ORDINANCE REPEALEDP
Point Raised That Cases of Pool-
sellers Prior to March 12
Should Be Dismissed.
An ingenious argument was made yes
terday afternoon before acting Police
Judge Barry by Attorney Long on be
half of John Smith, a poolseller, who was
arrested several weeks ago by Policemen
Tyrrell and Esola with several other
poolsellers south of Market street.
I>ong made a motion that the case be
dismissed, on the ground that the or
dinance against poolselling passed March
12 repealed the ordinance under which
Smith was arrested, and that therefore
he could not now be prosecuted. !!â¢â 
quoted numerous decisions to support his
contention. Attorney Joseph Dunne, for
the prosecution, replied tnat it was a
matter entirely "within the jurisdiction of
the court as to whether the point raised
was covered by a section of the Penal
Code which h^ quoted. The Judge said
he would reserve his decision till Satur
day.
There are a number of cas^s hinging
upon the point raised, and if the Judge
decides that it is well tkaen they will
all he dismissed. If not. the c.ise of
Smith will be set for trial.
Mrs. General Booth Coming.
Mrs. General Balllngton Booth of the
Volunteers of America, who la now fully
recovered from her long illness in the
East, is en route to this city; nnd will oc
cupy the pulpit of Calvary Presbyterian
Church, corner of Geary and Powell
streets, Sunday evening, March 26. Mrs.
Booth w-ill speak on her work in the State
prisons.
The Volunteers' .prison work is estab
lished in nine or ton Stnte prisons. There
are about .'-;T< Â« * prisoners in the Prison
League, and Mrs. Booth Is in touch by cor
respondence and spiritual dealing with
about 10,000 men within State prison walls.
Very nearly 7"> per cent of the men who
graduate through this branch of work
are satisfactory cases. Homes, known as
"Hope Halls," are established, into which
the prisoners are received, whf-re every
comfort and consideration Is shown them
and from which they are graduated to
positions of occupation. Surely this is
philanthropy of the highest order. All do
nations, offerings, etc.. received during
Mrs. Booth's visit will be used in this city
and State for this work.

General Booth on her California trip.

til some one suggested John I- Sullivan.
The big fellow was immediately selected
by Graney and SHby and a message was
dispatched to Stockton, where Sullivan
is at present, notifying him of the result
of the conference. In all probability feul
livan will refen â <â  the contest, as he in
formed several friends when the mat.-h
was made that be would not miss this
battle if he had to walk 200 miles over
railroad tlÂ»s to see it.
Sullivan has refereed several boxing
contests in the East and he has always
given general satisfaction. He is a strong

CYCLERS' ROAD EVENTS.
Preliminary Tryouts for the Coming
Annual Relay Race.
Tf the- weather clears sufficiently to per
mit the roads to dry there will be two
big rond races next Sunday, both short
distance handicap events, and both pre
liminary try-outs for the big relay race
to be held on May 14.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
five-mile race from San Leandrn to Hay
wards, starting about 1*1:30 o'clock, and at
the same hour the Olympic Wheelmen
will start a ten-mile scorch over the sec
ond relay from the Sierra Point Housf on
the San Bruno rond to San Mateo. A
lame number of men are In training for
these events, as the speed they develop
in them will materially decide whether
they are eligible to positions on the re
lay teams, an honor much sought for
among road racing wheelmen.
The Kay Cities are also active in their
preparations for their two coming social
eventsâ a ball at the Palace Hotel on
Wednesday evening, April 5. and a vaude
ville entertainment at Native Sons' Hall
on Thursday evening, April 13.
Eddie Bald, the short-distance champion
of the world, left tor the East last night
after a stay of nearly three months in
California. Raid will stop at his Buf
falo home for a few days and then go di
rectly to Paris.
Floyd McFarland has changed his mind
again. He now thinks he can beat Harry

The latter was sung by the quartet of the

Rounds was turned over to the Federal 'â¢
authorities" and he was Indicted by the
Federal Grand Jury for having in his
possession altered Government notes with
intent to defraud.
The case came up for trial yesterday in
the United States District Court, and the I
defendant's attorney interposed the plea
that the Government had failed to show
that Rounds had the notes in hie posses- ;
sion with the intention of defrauding. !
Judge de Haven decided that the point |
was well taken and the jury acquitted the i
defendant without leaving their seats.
Immediately after Rounds left the i
building he was rearrested by Detective
Egan on a charge of vagrancy. Rounds

VERY BAD POLITICS.
THE demoralization produced among the em- j
ployes of the Harbor Commission by the at- j
tempt made in the "late Legislature to reorgan
ize the board is not likely to abate for some time. No
sooner had the bill legislating the commissioners out
of office been rejected by the Senate than Governor [
Gage appointed F. S. Chadbourne to take the posi- j
tion of Mr. Herold, whose term has not expired, but
whe is alleged to have failed to qualify. This appoint
ment, if valid, with that of Mr. Kilburn, who has al
ready taken the place of President Colnon, would
give the politicians struggling to get possession of the
water-front patronage control of the commission.
What was thus attempted by act of the Legislature
lias been consummated by the appointment of a Har
bor Commissioner who can get his place only after
a lawsuit
At this time it is difficult to predict exactly what
programme will be adopted in seating Chadbourne by
the Governor and those who are urging him to thus
demoralize an important branch of the public ser
vice. It Kilburn and Chadbourne set up a commission ;
in opposition to Harney and Herold there will of ;
course be two Harbor Commissions, with two sets of i
rs, two corps of employes and a cloud of injunc- j
tions, writs of quo warranto, restraining orders and j
probably prohibitions. In short, work upon the
water front will be permanently suspended.
During the late session of the Legislature the em- j
ployes of the Harbor Commission spent the greater ;
portion of their time at Sacramento. The attempt to j
dispossess them of their places not only induced them j
to contribute heavily to an expense fund, but to tern- !
porarily abandon their duties for the less important j
work of legislation. Of course the impending im- I
broglio will not cause a repetition of this contest, but j
it will quite as thoroughly demoralize the employes
and put an effectual stop to the business of the board.
Exactly where Governor Gage is going to find
profit in thus upsetting an important arm of the gov
ernmental machine would be hard to determine. If
he has any political ambition it certainly cannot be j
promoted by such a usurpation. If he has no poli- :
tical ambition, but has been elected merely to secure '
berths for Republican "workers," he cannot expect :
to earn the gratitude of even that class, for, win' or
lose, they are bound to reproach him. Intelligent :
men who do not consider public office a private snap
but a trust which the office-holder is bound to dis- i
charge with a conscientious regard for the verdict of
history, if not the opinion of his contemporaries, will
geritrally disapprove of the Governor's action in this
matter.
WONDERS OF fIRKANSfIS.
' I "HE story from Arkansas of the discovery of the
ruins of a city which must once have contained
* 11,000,000 of people has the merit of largeness
and novelty. Anybody can go to the back counties of !
any State and discover mere villages, but to find a
city of these proportions is out of the ordinary.
Eleven million people are a good many. They are !
all dead now, and no wonder. They had no system of |
drainage, had not learned the beauty of filtered water, I
knew nothing of antiseptics, nor had learned how to |
operate for appendicitis. If 11.000,000 people were to
be in one city to-day they would pay attention to the
laws of sanitation or they would die, too.
The yarn from Arkansas possesses many points of
interest. If it is true, probably a search among the j
ancient structures will reveal much concerning a race j
which is hardly more than tradition, and if it is base- |
less, Arkansas can at least claim one of the finest liars \
extant.
The Russian official who is charged with having
committed the crimes for which Dreyfus is suffering i
denies his guilt. The world would pay respectful at
tention to any corroborative evidence he may have at
command.
A large element among the Spanish are glad that
the Philippines have been lost. And a large element
among the Americans are sorry they were ever
found.
The fact that the pool-sellers do not like Captain
Lees is one of the greatest hits the Chief of the Po
lice Department has had an opportunity to make.
Unfortunately there is no way in which the prize
contests of the evening newspapers can be declared
public nuisances.

THE BLfqCKSTOCK RESOLUTION.
BY the adoption of the Blackstock resolution the
Railroad Commission has put itself in a situa
tion from which it can emerge only by one
path. There is but one official act it can perform now
without violating the logic of the position â only one
step that it can take consistently with the record.
That one path open, that one act to be performed,
that one step to be taken, is to resign.
The Blackstock resolution was adopted avowedly
in the interest of economy. The report upon which
the resolution was based declares expressly that an
effort to enforce freight rate regulations is too costly
to be expedient. Referring to the suit involving that
question, which is now before the courts and has
been prosecuted for about three years, the report
says:
"I am further advised, as appears by the records
and by the report of the Attorney General to the As
sembly, that up to the present time there has been
paid and incurred in counsel fees and expenses in this
case more than $43,000, the counsel fees alone
amounting to more than $33,000, and it further ap
pears from like sources that the future costs and ex
penses of this litigation will be at least $67,000, $30,000
of which will be required as fees for experts and $30,
--000 as fees for special counsel."
So for the sake of saving that amount of money
the commission abandons the cause of the people,
stultifies itself, surrenders to the railroad, throws to
; the winds all the money and work expended in the
I past in making the fight, and then seeks to conceal
i from the public the true nature of this betrayal of
i trust by giving it the popular name of economy.
Bad as the thing looks, the people will accept it
with a fair degree of favor if the commissioners will
carry their doctrine to a useful conclusion and take
the only logical step left them. There is another
: economy to be carried out â the commissioners should
resign and save the taxpayers the expense of their
salaries.
It will cost the taxpayers of California $48,000 for
salaries, besides incidental expenses, to maintain this
Blackstock commission, and since it has now de
clared itself impotent and useless so far as -the regu
[ lation of railways is concerned, there is no service it
can render the people which will be worth forty-eight
cents. If the commissioners have any regard for
economy they will resign and turn their unearned
salaries back to the State treasury. If they do not
resign they will give the lie to their own words and
show themselves in sad need of whitewashing.
The taxpayers of California have paid out much
money for the Railroad Commission and have de
rived no benefit from it. Some former commissions
have tried, or at least made a pretense of doing so,
to render service to the people. The present commis
sion, however, does not even make a pretense, for
the rider to the Blackstock resolution, providing that
the board shall meet in April to fix and promulgate
a schedule of grain rates, doesn't amount to a pre
tense. In fact, the impotence, the worthlessness, the
nothingness of the commission, has been reduced to
its final element by the recent act, and the only way
for the Blackstock gang to save the situation is to re
sign and get out of it.
THE LATEST KANSAN CRISIS.
OWING to the skirmishing in the Philippines
and the Senatorial battles in various State
capitals the country has to some extent over
looked the legislative grand opera season in Kansas
this winter, and has thereby missed some very novel
performances. The Kansan troupe seems, in fact, to
have been as brilliant as ever, and was deserving of
considerable attention.
We pointed out some time ago that an effort had
been made by a wise member of that body to put an
end to personal pride or antagonism in legislation
by requiring that all bills be submitted in a strictly
anonymous way. The proposed reform was defeated,
but a new crisis has arisen in which the desirability
of eliminating personalities is so apparent that every
man involved in it is in favor of having it treated
anonymously. In fact, the press itself seems to have
taken the same view, and we have not been able to
learn the names of the men who have been most con
spicuous in its complications.
It appears that for a long time it has been found
necessary at each reassembling of the Legislature to
completely refurnish and equip the legislative halls.
Xo matter how large the supply of law books, sta
tionery, chairs, inkstands, etc.. furnished by the State
at any one session, it has always been necessary to
purchase a new supply when the time came for the
next session.
It has been a perplexing subject to the Kansans to
know what becomes of all these supplies. A blizzard
has never been known to clean out the legislative
halls, and yet the equipments vanish each year as
completely as -if forty blizzards had swept them.
To solve the problem the Executive Council of the
State took the precaution this year of placing a de
tective at every exit from the Capitol, with instruc
tions to see that no public property. was taken away,
and now the mystery is cleared up.
From this proceeding has followed the latest crisis
in Kansas and the general desire on the part of the
legislators that the discussion of its incidents shall
be strictly anonymous. It appears the detectives
found much to do. Anonymous gentlemen were de
tected going home not only with clear consciences,
but with typewriters, law books, inkstands, boxes of
envelopes and reams of paper; some even had chairs,
and one man had a desk.
Most of the depredators are reported to have been
legislative employes, who when halted declared they
regarded their spoils as a part of their perquisites. It
is stated, however, that almost every member had
something in the way of a souvenir, and one or two
quite prominent men were among the heaviest of the
raiders.
This sort of a crisis is so much an outcome of
strictly Kansan conditions that it could not possibly
occur in California, and yet it is so intense in all of
its incidents that to a good many people it will ap
pear like something that might possibly have hap
pened at Sacramento if there had been any detectives
there.
The Salvation Army a-nd its offshoot, the Volun
teers, have been making worldly faces at each other
in the East. Of course this is their own affair, but
people who make faces can hardly be in a mood to
snatch brands from the burning.
It is cheerful to observe United States vessels sa
luting the Spanish flag. Only a short time ago the
sight of that emblem would have caused them to have
turned loose a broadside.
So Teller is certain that Bryan will be nominated
again. This is good news. Doubtless it will cheer
Bryan as well as every Republican who happens to
notice it.
The introduction of a professional hangman into a
murder trial may have had an effect, but it certainly
was not that of cheering the prisoner
THE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, 3IABCH 23, 1899.
"T^HE disposition of Mr. Bryan to examine the
mouth of a gift horse, in the shape of an invi
tation to a banquet in honor of Thomas Jeffer
son, has again thrown all the Democratic fat in the
fire. â¢ '
The man from the Platte has caused it to be under
stood that he is nasty nice about the platter he feeds
from, and the company that gathers around the same.
The Democratic Club of New York, consisting of
three thousand members, none of them any special
kind of Democrats, but all just plain Democrats, de
siring to assure the shade of Jefferson that he is not
forgotten, engaged a caterer and a banquet board for
that purpose. The table, however, is designed to be
something more than a temporary resting-place for
solid food and liquids to wash, it down. It is to re
semble a battleship, in that it is a platform from which
to fire guns. These are not to be used with smokeless
powder, though one of the ingredients thereof, to wit,
alcohol, will be in them. They are to be the great
guns of oratory, and they are to roar in behalf of the
campaign of 1900. As Mr. Bryan is a rifle of that
kind he was invited to be present and get his tompion
out and limber up and crack away at any craft in
sight.
But he took the precaution to request of Mr. Bel
mont a working plan and specifications of the kind
or kinds of Democracy to be present, and also to in
quire if Mr. Belmont himself had experienced any
change of heart or head since he goldbugged in 1896.
To this Mr. Belmont replied, in effect, in the lan
guage of the Kentuckian, that when one gentleman
invited another gentleman to partake of spirits with
him the purpose was sociability and not catechism.
So the banquet will be plus the spirit of Jefferson
and minus the flesh of Bryan-. The incident would
seem trivial except for its bearing on future politics.
Mr. Bryan is of the opinion that he is the finest
piece of Presidential timber in the forest preserves of
the Chicago platform Democracy, and does not pro
pose to permit any comparison with the taller timber
which grows by itself on the gold-Democratic reser
vation. The well-intended overture of Mr. Belmont,
intended to get the former members of the party to
gether and fill the split between them with victuals
and drink, has been rejected with a scorn and con
tempt which will rankle for many a day.
Mr. Bryan is on his bright, shining way, holding
in the ranks such doubtful Democratic States as Ala
bama, Mississippi, Georgia and Tennessee, and feels
no need of feeding and drinking to unite the small
goldbug faction with the heavy Democratic majorities
in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and
Connecticut.
As for campaign funds for 1900, the goldbugs are
not wanted on the list. In the last conference at Chi
cago, attended by Bryan, Coin Harvey, Altgeld,
Towne, Dubois and Teller, it was settled that Coin
Harvey should go on collecting a dime a day, and
that the sum thus accumulated shall be reinforced by
the sale of the "Thomas Jefferson segar," to be manu
factured in Chicago and handled by a dealer who di
vides the profits with Mr. Bryan's committee. These
scgars will not be smoked at Mr. Belmont's banquet,
but no 16 to 1 Democrat will suck any other. The
profits are expected to be enormous, for all other
brands are to be boycotted.
It is with diffidence that we suggest an enlargement
of this fine idea. Where is the Jefferson brand of
whisky and beer? Let it be brought out at once
and let the clay of the new Democracy be moistened
with no other.
More terrible than an army with banners will be the
Bryan hosts of 1900. Filled with Jeffersonian spirits
and puffing the only JcfTersonian segar, they will
move like a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire
by night, and when their march is ended the gold
bug will be as lifeless as his congener and ancestor,
the bronze scarabeus, .wrapped up in coal tar with the
mummies.
THE LfIDY AND THE SIDE DOOR.
LOS ANGELES has a Police Commission ap
parently marked by austerity and a sense of
right which admits of no compromise. The
body is also â¢otherwise. peculiar.
Mayor Eaton is a power in the commission, and
he has views. Among these is one to the effect that
the side entrance to saloons is an instrumentality of
evil, because it lures the feminine rounder to quench
her thirst in an atmosphere not conducive to the pro
motion of modesty or morals. So far as this posi
tion is concerned the Mayor will find a ready support.
However, there are reformers who will stand aghast
at Mr. Eaton's declaration that a woman has as much
right to go into a saloon as a man has, but that she
should go in the front door, line up against the bar,
name her favorite tipple and toss it down as a man
would.
It does not seem that the Mayor would compel a
thirsty lady to go dry, but he would deny to her the
luxury of secrecy. Probably his idea is that rather
than cross the threshold to a saloon with the glare of
the public eye upon her the woman would appease
with a glass of innocuous sodawater her yearning for
refreshments.
There are saloons in this city where the plan is in
practical operation. Most of them are on Barbary
Coast, and the female patrons walk right in the main
entrance, nor seem embarrassed if observed. They
mingle with the men on terms of perfect equality
until such time as opportunity arises to administer
knockout drops to the male. Then he knows no
more. Later he awakens to find that his money has
vanished. It is hardly possible the Mayor of Los
Angeles would advocate this style of saloon. It
really is not a benefit to the community.
The time for some of the men and women who
neglect their children, leaving the little ones to
chance and charity, to be punished for the crime
seems to be due, or possibly overdue. Such cases are
frequently discovered, but discovery is too apt to be
the end of the matter.
Bryan is about to open a new campaign. He is
going to unnecessary trouble. He has already been
the hero of the only campaign in which he can cut a
considerable figure, and he did not get much out of
that.
Even their anxiety to publish news ahead of the
morning papers was no justification for the evening
sheets in announcing the death of John Sherman.
Creelman will have to get out of the Philippines
before anybody will believe the story from there that
the natives want to burn prisoners at the stake.
Probably Aguinaldo could not better please Otis
than by attacking Manila. There is an anxiety to get
the man within rifle-shot.
Havana is getting accustomed to the sway of the
police. The lesson is a hard one, and is keeping the
morgue busy.
Announcement 13 made that two fighters about to
meet are "lit as fiddles." But all fiddles are not fit.

CARE OF ASPHALT STREETS IN GERMANY.
The treatment of asphalt streets here in Breslau is entirely different from
methods employed in the United States.
For instance: One man has charge of four squares in front of the con
sulate. His tools for keeping the streets clean are as follows: An iron hop
per wheelbarrow, a shovel, a broom and a rubber scraper about three and
a half feet long. The rubber is fastened in a vise-like wooden clamp and is
about four inches wide, a quarter of an inch thick and very stiff. This man
during the day is continually going over his four squares, taking up the lit
ter and keeping the streets thoroughly clean. Early in the morning, after
having cleaned the street, he takes his wheelbarrow, loaded with very fine,
sharp sand, and scatters the same with his hands or a small shovel lightly
over the streets to prevent slipping.
Should it be a rainy day he repeats this process several times during the
day. Once a week two sprinkling cars are sent out alongside of each other,
so that they cover the whole street at one time with water, washing the
same thoroughly. Immediately folio-wing the sprinkling cars come four one
horse roller brush sweepers, about two feet in diameter, sweeping the water,
slime, etc., into the gutter, when the same is piled up and carted away. Then
the man who has charge of those streets comes along with his wheelbarrow
and sprinkles sand all over the street. In spring or autumn, when the
streets are often sloppy or wet, the washing is done several times during the
week.
I am informed the washing is done for the purpose of removing the
slime, which the asphalt seems to leave, and to keep the street from being
slippery; also for the preservation and hardening of the asphalt.
The man who has charge of the asphalt streets is paid 22 pfennings (5
cents) per hour. Ordinary street hands are also paid per hour and receive
18 pfennings (4 cents).
All streets are kept in excellent condition, the shopkeepers or tenants not
being permitted to put sweepings on the pavement or street. These must
be taken up and put in a box kept for that purpose.
The city has wire baskets fastened on lampposts, against houses, fences
or trees, in which the public may throw waste paper while walking along.
It is very rare to see any waste paper on the streets, as. the citizens in gen
eral take pride in keeping the streets clean. The householders have to
sweep the streets to- the center of the street regularly every morning before
6 o'clock. The litter is piled up and carted away by the city teams.

SHIPPING SAILORSâ A. C. F., City.
This correspondent asks: "If a sailor
ships for a voyage can he leave the ship
at an intermediate port and demand pay
for his services? If a captain ships a
crew to take his vessel from one port to
another, can he stop short of the port of
destination and discharge the men
against their will?" The answer to each
of these questions is that it all depends
on the terms of the contract. Generally
if a sailor should ship, say for a round
voyage, he would not be entitled to any
compensation if he left the vessel at an
intermediate port; likewise, the captam
and the ship would be liable for a failure
to comply with the terms of the contract.

PLATINUMâ E. G. S., Llvermore, Cal.
There are two methods of obtaining plati
num from the ore. One is known as the
Wollaston. The chief steps are as fol
lows:
j After removal of the metals associated with
! platinum â by the successive action of nitrio
! and hydrochloric acids the platinum itself ia
i dissolved in aqua regia, frrgn which it ia pre
i cipitated by a solution of sal ammoniac in the
form of a sparingly soluble double salt, am
monium platinochloride. This salt is washed
1 and heated to rednesss, by which the chlorine
j and ammonia are expelled, leaving the metal
lin the form of a gray spongy soft mass,
! known to chemists aa spongy platinum. In this
I form platinum cannot be fused into a compact
' form by ordinary furnace heat, but, like iron,
j It can be welded at a high temperature. Ac
| cordingly it is made into a thin past* w!fh
water, then introduced into a brass mold and
subjected to graduated pressure, by which the
water is squeezed out and the mass rendered
' sufficiently firm to bear handling. It is thÂ«Â»n
dried, very carefully heated to whiteness and
hammered or subjected to powerful pressure.
The Devllle-Debray method. â This is a very
j simple furnace. Two flat pieces of quicklim?
' are scooped out. representing two cupels, and
! form the bottom and the lid of the furnar*. ThÂ«
; lower cure! b^F a notch cut in its side to
serve as an exit fofr the liquefied platinum. The
! upper one is rierced at its center with a
! slightly conical round hole, through which the
(platinum) nozzle of an oxyhydrogren blowpipe
enters, sn that the flame beats down en the
metal within.

Russian Discoveries
Denounced.
GREAT BRITAIN FIRST OWNER
STORY CONCOCTED TO UNSETTLE
CONFIDENCE.
England's Title Is Old and Well Es
tablished and Was Acquired by
Discovery and Conquest
Many Years Ago.
Of all the silly and baseless stories ever
started about the Klondike the one lately
sent out from Dawson and published un
der sensational headlines to ih<
that the recent discovery by a party of
Russian Finns of an old boundary mon
ument stone 100 miles to the east of Daw
son Showed that the Klondike gold
belt formerly belonged to Russia, and
now, of course, to the United States in-
Etead of Canada, is by long odds the very
worst.
It is more than silly; it is almost crim
inally harmful, and must have been con
cocted and circulnted, nut in innorent ig
norance, but with the ulterior design of
misleading the public and unsettling con-
fidence in property values in that section-
According to the- story, the stone was
inscribed with half obliterated characters,
which the Finnish finders recognized as
Russian and succeeded in deciphering to
an extent that showed them that it was
â¢a monument set up by a party of Russian
and British surveyors as a boundary
mark, and that realizing the great im
portance of their discovery they hastened
to Dawson, where their news created the
greatest sensation and induced the Amer
ican Consul, Mr. McCook. and Mr. Ogil
vie the Canadian Commissioner, to send
out a joint committee to investigate and
-FlÂ°e whole story is decidedly fishy with
out thl Finns? who, as decipherers and
interpreters of the meaning of old in
scriptions, if such really existed In that
place, are not at a premium. Certainly
not in the #* of well-known facts to the
contrary of their interpretation. Russian
foothold on the American continent was
acquired during the second quarter pi tne
last century through the discoveries of
Admiral Bering and others, under v, hi.
they claimed down to latitude 04.40. It Is
well known that their movements
throughout the whole period of their pos
sessions were entirely confined to the vi
cinity of the coast, except on the Lower
Yukon, which they ascended as far as
Nulato less than 300 miles from the
mouth. ' They never penetrated even for
trading purposes any distance Into the
Interior The British title to Canada carae
from Cook's discoveries on the west coast
in 1778 and the conquest from the French
in 1759. No white man ever penetrated
into the Northwestern Territory west of
Mackenzie River until near the middle
of thf present century, when Forts Sel
kirk on the Upper Yukon and Peily Post
were established by the Hudson Bay
Company as the trading posts, and later
on Fort Reliance, near Dawson and Fort
Yukon, at the mouth of the Porcupine
R The* first question as to the boundaries
between the possessions of the two coun
tries arose in IS2I. and was settled by
trc-atv of February 28, IS2o. No survey
either jointly or singly, was ever agreed
between the two countries, and none was
In marie. 111 and IV of the above-men-
In articles TIT and IV of the above-men
tioned treaty between Great Britain and
Russia the boundary line as agreed upon
between their respective possessions is
described in the following terms: Com
mencing from the southernmost point of
the island called Prince of Wales Island,
which point lice in the parallel 54 degrees
40 minutes north latitude and between
the 131st' and 133 d degrees of west longi
tude, Greenwich meridian, the: said line
shall ascend to the north along the cnan
nel called Port Channel as far as the
point of the continent where It strikes the
o6th degree of north latitude. From this
last-mentioned point the line of demark
atlon shall follow the summit of the
mountains situated parallel to the coast
as far as the point of Intersection of the
14lst degree of west longitude of the same
meridian, and finally from the said point
of intersection the Bald meridian of the
Hist degree in its prolongation to the
frozen ocean."
It Is further provided that between the
intersections of the line with the 56th de
gree of latitude and the 141 st meridian it
is to follow the summit of the mountains
running parallel to the coast, where they
do not exceed ten marine leagues there
fromâwhere they do so exceed that dis
tance the line is to stand at ten marine
leagues from the coast. This is the only
nart of the line about which there could
be any dispute. _
In the treaty of lS67,by which Russia sold
her American possessions to the United
States the boundaries were described as
laid down in the treaty of 1825 between
Russia and Great Britain, as quoted
above. In 1592 the I'nited States and
Great Britain agreed by treaty on i joint
survey and delimitation of th.
along the "panhandle" that is southeast
of Mount St. Ellas. There was no agree
ment as to the continental part or the
line from that point north to the Arctic
Ocean, for the simple reason that there
was no necessity for any. r rom the in
tersection of the line with the I4lst mer
idian which i uts the side of Mount St.
Elias north to the Arctic the course of
the line is fixed. All that needs to be
done is to determine points along its
length by astronomical observations and
mark its actual position. This was
done at Beveral places In the \ukon Gal
ley four or five years ago, and shows the
line to be some forty miles west of Daw
son and 140 west of the "Bogus Finn
Line," and as far as the two Govern
ments interested are concerned, there it
will surely remain. So the excited Daw
sonites may rest easy as to their nation
al status, and prospective Klondikers
must go prepared to live and work under
Canadian laws, as heretofore.
IMPORTANT SALE OF REALTY.

Succesful Enterprise Based on Merit.
The few remedies which have attained to

and giving patisf action to millions of people
everywhere, are the products of the knowledge

in the form mopt acceptable to the human sys
tem by the s=kill of the world's great chemists;
and one of thÂ« most successful examples Is the
Syrup of Figs manufactured by the California
Tig Syrup Company. Unlike a host of imita
tions and cheap substitutes. Syrup of Figs Is
permanently beneficial in its effects, and there
fore lives and promotes good health, while In
ferior preparations are being ca6t aside and
forgotten.
In the process of manufacturing the pleasant |
family laxative made by the California F:Â« j
Syrup Company, and named Hyrup of Figs. fIRM I
are used, as they are pleasant to the taste; but !
the medicinal properties of the remedy arc ob- j
tamed from an excellent combination of plants j
known to be medicinally laxative and to act I
most beneficially. As the true and original
remedy, named Syrup of Figs, Is manufactured
by the California Fig Syrup Company only a
knowledge of that fact will assist in avoiding
the worthless imitations manufactured by other

WIRED THE GOVERNOR
TO SIGN THE BILL
CITY BUSINESS MEN WANT THE
EXPOSITION.
New Board of Directors of the Manu
facturers' and Producers'
Association.
Yesterday at the annual meeting' of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion in the Mills building, it was decided
to ask the Governor by telegraph to sign
Pacific Ocean Exposition bill, now
hung- up in the executive's outer office
with a number of its unfortunate fellows.
Messrs. Kc-rr and McKee objected to the
exposition on the ground that It would
bring foreign-made goods in competition
with the products of the home factories.
However, the practical benefits to be de
rived from such an exposition- in this
city, the great port of the Pacific, front
ing the Orknt with its markets, was too
apparent to a majority of the members
present and the motion to immediately
wire the Governor to sign the bill won its
way.
President Sbarboro said that with the
three-quarters of a million appropriated
by the city, one-quarter by the Legisla
ture ;ind a probable half-million from the
Federal Government the coming exposi
tion would not fail to be a practical and
splendid success.
The Federal Government grave Omaha
and other places $5<K),000 apiece for their
fairs and would certainly .do as well by
San Francisco. If this city would be the
great port on the nation's western sea
board .she muHt make herself known.
The following members, to compose the
new hoard of directors for the ensuing
year, were selected and elected unani
mously: ,
A. Sharboro, James W. Kerr. W. F.
Bowers, Charks R. Alien, L. R. Mead,
Frank L. Brown, Edward Everett, C. H.
Crocker, J P. Currier, Samuel McKee and
A. McLaughlin.
President Sbarboro. in reviewing the
work accomplished by the association
during the past year in fostering, prÂ«ti t
ing and up-building the manufacturing
and producing- interests of the State, re
ferred to the part taken by the associa
tion in May last, when the Government
was preparing to send troops to the Phil
ippines. The task of convincing the Gov
ernment of the advantages afforded by
San Francisco as a purchasing and dis
tributing point for clothing and supplier
in general for the use by the army was
Inaugurated by the Manufacturers' and \
Producers' Association and resulted in the j
recognition by the Government of that
fact to the extent that, according to the
statement of the depot quartermaster,
there have bren disbursed during the year
by this department alone between eleven
and twelve millions of dollars in this city.
\\'i rk in this direction was not confined
to this department of the Government, for
the efforts of the association were di
rected to others. A representative was
,i in to Washington who obtained con
cessions of additional territory to be fur
nished with goods and supplies from this
city, for the Indian agencies und schools
located this side of the Rockies, worth in
the neighborhood of fifty thousand dollars
annually.
The Navy Department was likewise pe
titioned to enlarge the present scope of
the Mare Island Navy Yard as a distrib
uting point for supplies for the navy, in
view of the increase of the naval estab
lishment on this coast.

Killed by a Shock.
Frederick J. Marham, an 11-year-old
boy, died in the City and County Hos
pital yesterday morning of shock, the re
sult of a beating received at the hands
of an unknown boy. Marham was re
turning home from the Stanford School
on February 15. when another boy 18 or
19 veara old knocked him down with a
blow. He was taken by his classmates to
his home at 21 Harrison avenue, and from
there removed to the City and County
Hospital on March 9. Marham's father \
is in the hospital suffering from tubercu- !
losis and gangrene â a leg and an arm
having been amputated. No hopes are
entertained for his recovery.
Mrs. Marham, the boy's mother, has five
other children to care for, and she is in
destitute circumstances.

DIRECTORS ARE
REVERSED BY
THE EDUCATORS
Examiners Opposed
to Board.
A CONFLICT OF AUTHORITY
TEACHERS' EXAMINATIONS ARE
ADVANCED TO MONDAY.
The School Authorities Had Fixed
the Date for June, but This
Was Arbitrarily-
Changed.
The Board of Examiners has reversed
the Board of Education.
At the last meeting of the latter body
the Directors determined to postpone until
June 24 the regular examination of teach
ers for certificates. The Board of Ex
aminers met yesterday afternoon in the
office of Superintendent of Schools Web
ster and arbitrarily set Monday next at
1:30 o'clock as the time at which the ex
aminations should take place. It was
held by those at the meeting that the
Board of Education had no jurisdiction
in the matter and should never have in
terfered.
The Board of Examiners is made up of
Superintendent of Schools Webster, who
acts as president; Miss P. M. Nolan, sec
retary; James T. Hamilton, James H.
Simmons and Clarence Walker. Appli
cants lor teachers' certificates appear be
fore this board at stated intervals and
undergo an examination as to their qual
ifications to teach. The present conflict
of authority is a peculiar one. The Board
of Education is the governing body and
as such has jurisdiction over the exam
iners. The latest move of the latter is,
therefore, a puzzle to those who follow
the movements of the School Directors.
The School Directors will not meet until
Wednesday next, so they cannot delay
the action of the examiners, if they
would.
Representatives of the teachers and of
the merchants will meet again this after
noon at the Girls' High School and will
endeavor to adjust the differences which
exist between them regarding the settle
ment of their respective claims against
the city. The teachers are moved by con
flicting emotions. Some want what
money is available in the school fund di
vided between the teachers and the mer
chants, while others object strongly to
any such procedure. In a recent cir
cular the latter say:
That any sort of compromise tending in
any way to recognize or to help validate
the 80-called creditor^ 1 claims en masse is
wmng: and ought never to be consented to
by the teachers of the department, inas
much as their complaint before the Su
perior Court prondtinced these claims il
legal and absolutely void and the court has
so declared the law.
The outcome of the litigation so far has
been so unsatisfactory to the teachers
that many of them shrink from further
experience of the law's delays. The meet
ing this afternoon is expected to prove
a spirited one, as those opposed to a
compromise with the merchants will pre
sent what they think is a strong case.
The announcement in The Call yester
day that the balance of the January sal
aries were ready and would be paid upon
demand proved welcome news to the
teachers. Before 10 o'clock over 60 per
cent of the teachers had called at the
office of Secretary Simpson and received
their warrants. The inclemency of the
weather did n<>t deter them. The major
ity of the teachers were paid during the
day. as Treasurer Truman kept his office
open until a late hour to accommodate
teachers from outlying districts.
A NEGLECTFUL MOTHER.
Mrs. Kate Pullen Arrested for Cruel
ty to Her Three Young Children.
Three young children, the oldest 10
years of age, were left to the tender mer
cies of the neighbors by their mother,
Mrs. Kate Pullen, ISU Hickory avenue,
I from Saturday night till Tuesday night.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
! to Children was notified yesterday morn
! ing. and Officers McMurray and Coleman
â  went to the house and arrested Mrs.
; Pullen and Adrian Silvey, a teamster, and
I they were hooked at the City Prison on a
: charge of cruelty to children.
Mrs. Pullen said she went to Palo Alto
i Saturday night tin a visit, intending to
return Sunday night, but was prevented.
She knew that the neighbors would at
tend to the children and she did not
j worry about them. The children looked
; healthy and clean and showed that the
: neighbors had been kind and attentive
; to them.
Mrs. Pullen's husband is a farmer at
i Hollister. They separated some months
ago owing to her fondness for liquor, and
she came to the city with the three chil
dren. She met Silvey and he has been
stopping with her since. He is 29 years
of age and she is 40.
Sutter-Street Repairs.
City and County Attorney Lane sub
mitted an opinion to the Supervisors re
garding the repair of Sutter street. He
holds the Sutter Street Railroad Com
pany must keep the space between its
tracks and two fort on each side in re
pair. The city, however, cannot express
ly require the company to corrugate the
s"tone blocks. Complaint was lodged with
the Board some time since by teamsters
regarding the slippery condition of the
street between Grant avenue and Stock
ton street.
Wants His Valuable Pointer. ,
Al Smith, the horseman, swore to a
complaint for a search warrant In Judge
! Conlan's court yesterday to obtain pos
â  session of his valuable pointer dog, which
i he claims is being illegally detained by
| "Jane Doe." 3528 Sacramento street. The
dog was missed last Saturday and Smith
alleges that he has discovered it at the
i house on Sacramento street.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
! CHICAGO, March 22.â A sharp bulge on the '
curb before business commenced, together with ;
the unfavorable weather, caused an eager de
mand for wheat at the start. May opened V
to 1c higher at 63@<i9%e. and as several trad
ers who have been skeptical as to serious dam
\ age to winter wheat changed their minds and
showed a sudden desire to become possessed of
contracts for future supplies, the market con
tinued to maintain an upward tendency. By
the time the price got to 69%' c, however, the
most urgent buyers" wants had been satisfied. j
and as soon as this support was withdrawn the ;
advance came to a halt. Then longs started to
take profits and as there was a good deal of
selling for the short account it did not take
long for the price to recede to 68$ic.
Liverpool closed with a gain for the day of
, from Id to Hid. This, together with fresh out
j side buying orders that came in, which were
I more than sufficient to absorb the offerings,
; started another upturn and at the close May
I wheat was bringing 69Vi@69%c.
The corn market was strong and the specu
'< lative business good. Receipts were very light
; and Indications were in favor of them running
j slim for some time to come, as the few accept
ances of bids amounted to almost nothing.
May closed He higher.
Light offerings and a good speculative de
mand based on tbe belief - In a late spring
strengthened oats. May closed %c higher.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIjIj, THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1899.
BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. March 22.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
There Is a better feeling In the wool trade
than there was a week ago. Although It is
generally admitted that the" formation of tha
worsted trust may bring about some change in
established methods of doing business, it is
realized that even if tha plans of the promoters
of both the worsted and woolen trusts are car
ried to a successful consummation, they will
be able to control less than a half of the
machinery' employed In manufacturing goods,
so that it is acknowledged generally that the
bulk of the wool consumed will continue to be
purchased as it has been. Temporarily, how
ever, there Is more pressure to sell than there
was, and prices are on the whole easy.
The sales of the week In Boston amount to
1,921.000 pounds domestic and 469,500 pounds
foreign, making a total of 2.390,500, against a
total of 1,871,500 for the previous week, and a
t"tal of 1,299,500 for the corresponding week last
year. Sales since January 1, 1899, amount to
41,064,500 pounds, against 88,425,980 pounds last
year at this time.
LONDON WOOL SALES.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFF'S.
There was no Hay market, owing to the rain.
Feedstuffs remained quiet and unchanged.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"The weather lias Interfered with business
Â»to so great an extent during the last week that
we have nothing much of Interest to report
concerning the hay market at the present time.
The continued dryness and rather light receipts
were causing a considerable movement with
hay and prices were advancing rapidly. Rain
always has a depressing effect on all produce
markets, and as it interferes with the hand
ling of hay we have found during the past two
or three days that prices have dropped back
a bit. more especially as receipts are run
ning somewhat heavier this week than last.
'â¢Many farmers who would not sell their hay
at any figure ten days ago are now commenc
ing to unload. If all the holders of hay con
clude to get rid of their stocks Immediately
the market will probably be overcrowded and
we will see a? still further decline In prices. If.
however, hay is sent to market slowly and
evenly we will note a firm tone to the market
and possibly an advance of from $1 to $2 per
ton over the present range.
"A careful estimate of the amount of hay in
the country contributory to San Francisco con
vinces us that there is Just about enough to
supply us until the advent of the new crop.
If a greater portion of the hay Is marketed
at once prices will decline temporarily, but
when a shortage Is noted, say In a month's
time from now, hay may Jump up $5 or $6 per
ton. We would not like to see this condition
of affairs, but would ad\'ise all holders of hay
to send In their goods in a moderate manner,
thus Insuring a healthy tone to the market and
helping to bold prices to an even range. Re
ceipts for the past six days have been close to
2200 tons, 400 tons in excess of needs.
"Oregon and Washington have about quit
sending hay to this market, for they find a
better market throughout the southern portion
of the State where stocks of hay are very low.
An occasional straggling shipment of timothy
comes to market, but it does not meet with
much favor." i

of the Sugar Fleet Cut
to Â§25.
â¢; The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda got away for Australia at an early
hour this morning. She was to have sail
ed at 10 p. m. yesterday, but owing to the i
non-arrival of the English mall it was \
nearly daylight before she got away.
About sixty cabin and thirty-five steerage
passengers went away with the mail
steamer. Colonel C. Compton, U. S. A.,
was a passenger to Honolulu. He is go
ing there to look after the garrisoning of
the islands.
â¢ The Alameda took away a very large j
cargo of merchandise. She has aboard j
goods for Australia. Hawaii, New Zeal
and, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga and even the
Cape of Good Hope. There are large con
signments of canned goods, hops, bicycles
for almost every point In the southern
seas, machinery, beer, cigarettes and to
bacco, wine, fertilizers and almost every
conceivable kind of merchandise.
The river steamer Captain Weber is j
back in commission again. She broke her
shaft while on her way to Stockton about i
a month ago and has been laid up for re
pairs ever since. She is to be fitted with
steam steering gear and other labor-sav
ing devices, and when completed will be j
one of the finest steamers on the San j
Joaquln River.
The steam whaler Grampus is fitting
out for a three years' cruise in the Arc
tic. The majority of the whaling fleet
has got away, but all expect to be back
next November or December at the latest.
The Grampus, however, will winter on.
the mouth of the McKenzie River, and
next spring a : new crew and supplies will
be taken up to her.
The ship J. D. Peters, fitted out for a
voyage to the canneries at the Arctic Oil
Works was to have sailed yesterday, but
things could rot be got ready in time, so
ehe will leave to-day. There were lively

\bout one hundred soldiers arrived

c W Daley freight clerk on the Oceanic
wharf had an experience yesterday that
"wfilnotWel for many moon?.. He
was at tie head of the wharf, measur
ing some freight which was to be shipped
on the Alameda, when the telephone bell
rang A female, voice asked for the .
clerk, and Daley was sent for in a hurry.
He made his way up the wharf at a 2:40 i
gait, only to find that it was one of the
Alameda 1 s lady passengers who wanted
to know if the rain would delay the sail
ing of the mail steamer. A blue streak
followed the usually good tempered
freight clerk to the head of the wharf,
where he resumed his work In silence.
In future the rate of wages on all ves
sels of the sugar fleet will be $25 a
month. That is the rate paid on Welch
&, Co.'s vessels for months past, but Wil
liams, Dlmond & Co.'s and the J. D.
Spreckels & Bros. Co.'s captains have
been paying ?30 right through the winter
months." The cause for the change came
last Washington's birthday. The men on
the $30 a month vessels took a holiday, in
ppite of the rush, while the men on the
125 a month fleet had to work. In conse
quence the bark Albert and the barken
tines S. N. Castle and S. G. Wilder will

A grocer in the suburbs of Chicago
has a son about six years old who has
been kept in the country with an aunt
a goodly part of the time, owing to his

â¢ -Thfe last summer when the little

and hearty, but when he sat down to
his father's table, he refused the meat
and potatoes and demanded Grape-
Nuts, the ready cooked food.
The" grocer knew about Grape-Nuts,

counter, but it never occurred to him
to use them at his own table. It was
found upon inquiry that the boy began

shown by his condition.
It is needless -to say the grocer

CAUGHT IN A TREACHEROUS STORM.
THE British bark Strathdon. which arrived Tuesday night, made a quick passage from Newcastle,
NSW beating the American barks Sonoma, now out ninety-three days, and the Prussia,
out eighty-nine days. The captain reports that in latitude 28 south, longitude 148 west, "very
unsettled and stormy weather was experienced, with very treacherous rain squalls." On February Ka the
bark was becalmed off Pitcairn. but although the islanders burned beacon fires at night, no communi
cation could be held, as the island was twenty-three miles away. All went well after that until the Strath
don was off the coast of California, when she ran into a northwest gale, "with hurricane squalls and a very
high, confused sea." The Strathdon is coal-laden.
for treatment. He was out Tuesday and
got his feet wet and supposes that it had
an effect on his eves, as that night he was
unable to see. He went out yesterday
hoping that the open air might restore his
sight.

ILLNESS FOR ONE,
OLD AGE THE OTHER
ERASMUS PETERSON
DESIRES TO DIE
ERASMUS PETERSON, an old
man without money or friends,
attempted to hang himself in his
room, 625 Merchant street, Mon
day afternoon. He twisted a rope
round a nail in the wall and tied the
other end round his neck after climb-
Ing on top of a chair. Then he kicked
the chair from under him, and was
slowly strangling to death when his
landlady noticed him and raised an
alarm. A watchmaker on the oppo
site side of the street cut the old man
down and cut the rope in pieces so
that he could not make another at
tempt.
Tuesday the old man went to the
California street station and was
locked up, as he said he was afraid
he would do himself harm. Yesterday
morning Judge Mogan was disposing
of the "drunks" at the City Prison
and when the old man, with his long:
gray beard, stepped forward the
Judge said. "I^et him go."
"I don't want to go," replied the old
man. "I was not drunk, sir, but gave
myself up, as I was afraid I would
kill myself. I want to be sent to an
insane asylum, as my mind is giving
way and I will be prevented from kill
ing myself."
The Judge was surprised at the old
man's earnestness and ordered him to
be locked up till inquiries could be
made about him. He will probably be
sent to the Almshouse.
Peterson, when seen later, said that
he was a tailor, but old age and sick
ness had kept him from doing much
work. He had tried to hang himself
Monday and would do so again if he
trot the chance. His boots were full
of holes and he wore the last of his
clothing. He had lived in this city
for the past twenty years and his wife
and children had all died and been
buried here. He has a frightened
look in his eyes that betokens ap
proaching insanity. He said he would
prefer to be sent to an asylum, but
the Almshouse would do.

MRS. META HARRIS
SHOOTS HERSELF
MRS. META HARRIS, the
daughter of the late "W. H.
Haight, a prominent Mormon at
Farmington, Utah, attempted to
commit suicide early yesterday morn
ing in her room at 8 Mason street by
shooting herself in the left breast.
She is at the Receiving Hospital and
the chances are that the wound will
prove fatal.
About 3 o'clock yesterday morning
Mrs. Reynolds, who Occupies a room
adjoining the one occupied by Mrs.
Harris, heard the report of a pistol
shot. She could not definitely fix the
location of the shot and paid no more
attention to the circumstance. Mrs.
Irwin, the landlady, had occasion to
go into Mrs. Harris' room shortly be
fore 10 o'clock and was shocked to
find her lying on the floor in her
nightrobe, with blood stains on the
front of her robe. The police were
notified and Mrs. Harris was sent to
the hospital in the ambulance. Drs.
Weil and Rinne found that the bullet
had entered the left breast, but they
were unable to locate It. They ex
pressed the opinion that the wound
was dangerous and might result fa
tally. Captain Bohen detailed Detec
tives Dlnan and Crockett to inquire
into the case, and on searching the
room they found the revolver in the
bureau with one chamber empty.
Mrs Harris admitted that she had
fired the shot. She had been a suf
ferer from rheumatism for a long
time and it made her despondent.
She bought the revolver with the in
tention of killing herself, and it was
the report of the shot that Mrs. Rey
nolds heard about 3 o'clock In the
morning. From that time till the
landlady had discovered her she had
been lying on the floor in a seml-con
scious condition.
Mrs. Haight, the young woman s
mother, as Bhe is only 24 years of age,
and her niece were also living in the
house. Mrs. Haight and the niece
came here about two months ago with
the object of taking Mrs. Harris home
to Farmington, Utah, but she had
been so bad with rheumatism that
she could not stand the Journey.
CAUGHT AFTER
FIVE YEARS
Arrest of a Negro for an
Atrocious Murder.
Eoeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 22.â James Bill
ings, a negro ex-convict, was arrested
in Brooklyn to-day on the charge of
having killed Susie Martin In the dis
trict known as "'Hell's Kitchen." in
1894. Billings' arrest was brought about
by the confession of William Johnson,
a negro convict -whose sentence at Sine
Sing has just expired.
The Susie Martin murder created a
great sensation. She disappeared from
her home, 656 Eleventh avenue, on
March 8, 1594. Eleven days later her
headless and limbless body was found
In a Thirty-ninth-street cellar, the
Identification being made by a portion
of her clothing.
Almost a year later, on March 6.
1895, the little girl's skull was discov
ered In a heap of rubbish in a cellar
at 459 West Forty-sixth street. De
tectives worked night and day. but
failed to discover the murderer. Now
Johnson says that the murderer con
fessed to him soon af;er the crime.
The guilty man, according to John
son's story, came to his house about
a week before the girl's mutilated body
was discovered. His clothing was cov
ered with blood, and he said he had
been in a fight in "Hell's Kitchen."
Johnson says he gave the man a clean
shirt and a pair of trousers and the
blood-stained clothing was carried
away.
After Susie Martin's body had been
discovered, Johnson declares, his friend
confessed to him. The man said he
was intoxicated when he met the girl
in Thirty-ninth street. He dragged
her into the cellar, and after assault
ing her, choked her to death and then
cut up her body so nobody could tell
who she was.

In the German Hospital, In this city, last
Tuesday. The Coroner held an inquest

"AIDA" GIVEN
ANOTHER FINE
PRESENTATION
Gadski Repeats Her
Former Triumph.
CEPPI BETTER THAN EVER
BIG CROWD TURNS OUT TO THE
BOSTONIANS.
Comment and News of the Regular
Bills to Be Seen at the
Various Local Play
houses.
Thepe was not a crush at the opera
last night, but the crowd was some
what larger than the one that attended
the first production of "Aida," and the
performance was, as before, an enthusi
astic success. The curtain was rung up
eight times at the close of the third act
to a wild accompaniment of hand-clap
ping, boot thunder and bravos. The
cast was the same as at the other per
formance, with the exception of one
change: Rains replaced Boudouresque
in the part of the High Priest; and this
young American basso acquitted him
self with dignity and strength. Ceppi's
Radames was even better than before;
Qadski lived up to her earlier triumph
as Aida, and Olitzka, Bensaude and
Stehman contributed industriously to
the night's entertainment. Although
the crowd was not a huge one, there
was a long line of carriagesâ a double
row that extended from Third street to
Mission near Fifth. A big crowd will
be in attendance to-night, when Melba
will sing Juliet for the first time here.
De Lussan will repeat her Carmen to
morrow night, and for the farewell per
formance of Saturday afternoon Melba
and Chalia will appear in the double
bill of "Lucia" and "Pagliacci."
Notwithstanding several changes in
the company and the grand opera comÂ»
petition, the Bostonians are making out
a big week in "Rob Roy." The Colum
bia was packed last night and the line
of carriages stretched a block on both
sides of Powell street. The piece will
easily run another week.
Around the corner at the Tivoll there
Is still more operaâ that jovial master
piece of Gilbert and Sullivan, "The Mi
kado," which is attracting moderate
audiences. There will be a week's re
vival of the "Bohemian Girl," com
mencing Monday, and after that the
big Easter spectacle.
At the Alcazar the farce by the un
usual title of "Nerves" is playing to
good attendance.
The Alhambra is rapidly building up
a clientele of its own and bids fair for
permanent popularity. The present bill
is "La Belle Mario," with Agnes Hern
don in the double role, supported by the
regular stock company.
Half a dozen opera companies could
not stop the rush to the Orpheum,
where there are a bunch of new vaude
ville turns and a crush every night.
Several weeks ago it was suggested
in this column that the Chutes manage
ment vary the agony of "amateur
night" by exposing the novices in an
amateur cake walk. Since then these
cake walks have become a wonderful
feature and another one will be given
to-niÃht. Great is the power of the
press! _______âââ
ACTS OF AN INSANE WOMAN.
Mrs. Sarah Vogelsang Tried Twice
to Set the House on Fire.
Mrs. Sarah Vogelsang, wife of Mark
Vogelsang, a laborer for the Street De
partment, living: in the rear of 287 Minna
street, was locked up in a padded cell in
the Receiving Hospital yesterday after
noon.
She has been laboring under a mild
form of Insanity for the past two yours,
and for the sake of his three young chil
dren the husband did not like to pond her
away Twice recently she attempted to
burn the house by sprinkling coal oil over
the floors and petting fire to it, but no
serious damage was done. Yesterday she
became violent and broke all the windows
in the house and smashed some of the
furniture.
Vogelsang was sent for and he had her
taken to the Receiving Hospital. As the
rain was pouring into the house through
the broken windows he took the three
children and went with them to the City
Prison where Officer McMurray of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children saw him und arranged for their
care till he could get the home fixed for
them again.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 22.
Acting Postmaster General Heath to
day received a personal letter from
Captain W. H. Elliott, director of posts
of Porto Rico, relating to his experi
ences on an official tour of the island,
which he has Just completed. Director
Elliott said the people were incredulous
when he told thorn that sealed letters
would be sacred in the mails, and that
any one who meddled with mail in tran
sit or in possession of the Government
would be severely punished. He said
the Porto Ricans intrusted to the mails i
only unimportant letters, never mailing |
any matter regarded as private or valu- j
able, as the mails had frequently been i
rifled.
The municipal authorities in the j
island, Captain Elliott reports, regard
their relief from the trouble and ex
pense of carrying the mails as the
greatest blessing. The municipal au
thorities have been compelled to carry
the mails without compensation as a
sort of interchange of governmental
courtesy, an imposition required .by the
general laws of the island.
The people, says Captain Elliott, have |
returned to their regular avocations
and in the farming communities the
crops are in fine prospect and the peo
ple expect to be prosperous. All are
greatly pleased with the coming of
American rule. Director Elliott says the
report of dissatisfaction or danger of
rebellion among the people is untrue;
they are entirely satisfied with Ameri
can rule and regard it as a blessing.

LIFE SAVED BY SWAMP=ROOT.
Dr. Kilmer Has Discovered a Remedy;
That Cures All Kidney and . .
Bladder Troubles.
Swamp-Root, discovered by the emi-
nent kidney and bladder specialist, Dr.
Kilmer, has truly wonderful power in
curing kidney, bladder and uric acid
diseases.
Kidney trouble is responsible for more

other disease. Your kidneys filter the
blood and keep it pure.

Call every reader will be sent by mail,
prepaid, a free sample bottle and with
it a book telling more about Swamp-
Root, and containing some of the thou-
sands of testimonial letters received
from sufferers cured.

PRESIDENT
W. R. HARPER
IN BERKELEY
Addresses Students of
the University.
AN ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION
THE MILITARY REVIEW WAS
NOT HELD.
But the College Men Gathered in
Harmon Gymnasium to Hear
.the Distinguished Vis-
itor Speak.
BERKELEY. March 22.â Three hun
dred days or more out of a year the Uni
versity of California students can turn
out in full military array in honor of dis
tinguished visitors. Those are the days
â¢when it does not rain. To-day, however,
it did rain, and rained furiously, bo that
The Berkeley campus appeared In its very
â¢worst form as President Harper arrived
this morning. All attempt at anything i
like a parade was entirely out of the |
question, and President Kellogg issued
a notice rescinding the order for the re
view.
Everybody, of course, apologized for
the rain, but the visitor from the "Windy I
City seemed to take It as a matter of
course, and while expressing his regret |
at not seeing the demonstration prepared j
for him, remarked that he was only too â 
glad to meet the students and talk to
them by themselves as a student body.
There was no doubt in the minds of the
students that they were heartily glad Jo
see him in retu"rn, for when he stepped j
on the platform in Harmon Gymnasium
this afternoon they rose en masse to
gTeet him, and an improvised yell went
ringing through the building:
Ha! Ha! Ha! California!
U. C, Chicago.
Zip! Boom! Ah!
President Harper acknowledged the
compliment, and having been introduced j
by President C. E. Thomas of the Asso- ;
Ci'ated Students began his address. It was I
a clear, forcible, decisive appeal to lead
the nobler life offered by the opportuni- I
ties of thinking, and his hearers listened
â with close attention as he led them
through a careful analysis of his subject.
His manner of speaking was simple and
direct, devoid of all ostentation, with
â very few gestures, but strong and im
:ve. .
lent Harper said: I wish to say
a few words on the subject of thinking. '
Tou will be kind enough to notice ihat
the Bubject is not "thought," but "think
ing." My theme is not a philosophical
one. but* pre-eminently practical.
"To think is to live. Life itself is only
an expression of thought. Life without
thinking is not life. To follow the prog
ress of" thought is to walk in the path
along which the world moves. To think,
therefore, is to act. It is to speak, to
live to be.
â¢â¢May I make an inquiry of those of
you who have entered upon your college
career? What is your purpose in the
years that are to follow? Is it to think? |
Will you make an effort to be numbered
among th.- thinking- few? To be a stu
dent moans that you have desired to rise
to a higher plane on which to live the
life that God has given you. I ask you
Is it your purpose to live an intellectual
life, to take interest in intellectual Ques- j
tions to concern yourself with intellect
ual affair?; In other words, to maintain ,
the position you have taken? In still
Other words, to become a leader in the
world's higher work? I
"In asKjng you this question and in i
Dressing it upon you for consideration. I |
recognize your right in turn to ask me
three quesnons: First is there an op
portunity to think? Second, does the
world give permission to think? Third,
â¢what is tho nature of current thinking?
The speaker dwelt at length .upon each
answer to these, laying especial stress
upon the last. He described current
thinking as more scientific than that of
â nast generations, less dogmatic, by far
more accurate and tolerant. ' Current
thinking now goes deeper than in former
days It deals even in tho popular mind
â with that which is fundamental. In the
upheavals of society, symptoms of wnlch
are on all sides, we have a signal Illus
tration of this. Unrest, wherever it is
found arises from a determination to
settle great and important questions in a
new way. The greatest and noblest char
acteristic of modern times is the spirit
of toleration which everywhere prevails;
the most fundamental principle of our
political system; the highest law of our
social life." This constitutes Americas
contribution to the worlds history, a con
tribution which has cost four centuries
of self-sacrificing devotion to a high
ideal and a contribution which, so far as
it has been accepted by other nations,
v as influenced beyond all calculation !
their national and individual life |
â¢ â¢We occupy a plane far higher than
that occupied by our generations of the
cast but something still higher is possi
ble 'and being possible must be attained
Ik the thing to be attained by going still
dUpw in our study of the problems of
life and living? This will help, and from
this gTÂ»at results will be assured, but the
th ng desired will be still greater. Mate
rialism does not furnish the key which
will unlock the secrets of the future The
visible world is great, but the invisible
still greater. Our thoughts must rise
above that which is simply material; our
minds must grapple with the problems of
the unseen. It is our function and our
duty to give to the world ideals which a
thousand years even may not see ful
"America, intended in the providence of
God to do more for humanity than has
been done by any nation of the many that
have helped humanity, stand;* to-day be
fore the whole world as an object lesson
for the study of what free and independ
ent thinking will produce. Let us then
pledge ourselves to trample down the
false and to uplift and uphold the true,
to make the thinking of our time not
merely Fclentific, but ethical and in the
best sense spiritual."

High Water Bates Paid.
OAKLAND. March 22.â 8y the votes of
Mayor Thomas and City Engineer Cle
ment the disputed water bills of the two
. companies against the city for fire hy
drants were ordered paid this morning.
The Oakland company's bills amounted to
$2361 SO and the Contra Costa company to
52106 05. This is about three times what
has been paid under the old ordinance,
and the claims are based on the ordinance
of the "solid six," passed last year, but
â which was never enforced until this year.
City Attorney Dow opposed the payment
of the bills on various grounds,, but the
arguments of the water companies' at
torney prevailed with the Mayor and City
Engineer. These are the last bills upon
which the present board will act.
Dt. Wakefield Declared Elected.
OAKLAND, March 22.â The City Council
completed the canvass of the election re
turns to-night and there were no changes
from the unofficial figures. Councilman
Girard Introduced a resolution declaring
â Wakefield not elected as School Director
because of the reasons already set forth
In The Call. President Heitmann de
clared the resolution out of order, as the
Council can entertain no evidence but the
votes regarding aqy candidate Dr.
Wakefield was declared elected with the
rest, and Jf he does not resign his case

BRANDES' FATE
WILL SOON BE
DETERMINED
Noted Murder Case Is
Being Argued.
ACCUSED DENIES CONFESSION
ATTORNEY MATTHEWS ALSO
MAKES STRONG DENIAL.
Deputy District Attorney Melvin Bit
terly Attacks the Testimony of
the Defense's Chief Med
ical Expert.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
POB Broadway, March 22.
Attorney Wickliffe Matthews denies
positively that Brandes ever made any
confession of guilt to him. either in his
capacity as attorney or landlord.
The house in which Brandes lived at
Berkeley is owned by Mr. Matthews, and
the attorney went to see Brandes regard
ing the disposition of the house and of
the furniture, when the alleged confession
is said to have been made.
"There is absolutely nothing in the
story that Brandes made ,a confession to
me," he said. "At one time he consulted
! me about his case, but he always de
clared that he was innocent. He never
made a single admission of guilt."
Brarules says that he was associated
with Matthews in a business capacity, but
did not discuss with him the details of
Lillian's death.
This morning the Brandes murder case
closed. But first J. E. Harvey was re
called and an important piece of testi
mony was adduced. He testified that
while he was residing at the Brandes
house there never was a trunk upstairs
to the best of his recollection, clearly con
tradicting Brandes. Then Detective Her
bert took the stand and identified the lo
cation of the furniture in the dead girl's
room and gave measurements. Finally
Drs. Eastman and Pratt were recalled for
additional expert testimony in thfi nature
of sur-rebuttal, whereupon the prosecu
tion rested, while the jurors, attorneys
and the accused heaved a sigh of relief.
The case has occupied six weeks.
Shortly before noon Deputy District At
torney Melvin A>mmeneed argument and
occupied the entire afternoon. He por
trayed in eloquent words a picture of Wil
liam A. Brandes, the accused, as he beat
to death his innocent daughter Lillian.
He dwelt at length upon the testimony
of neighbors and summed up Brandes'
acts as such beside which the cruel
butcheries of the Spanish Weyler pale
into insignificance. He recited Hrandes'
fiendish act in hanging up the dead girl's [
body to save his neck from the gallows j
and to deceive the officers for the pur- i
pose of cheating the law.
In his argument Attorney Melvin re- i
ferred particularly bitter to Dr. E. H.
Woolsey, chief medical expert for the de
fense, who had stated absolutely that |
Lillian had hanged herself; that death j
was not due to any blows on the piri's i
head, and who startled the jurors with his
testimony as to Lillian's virtue.
"A man who would attack the reputa
tion of a dead girl," said Mr. Melvin, "a3
he did should have a special hell con
structed for him, for he is not fit to herd
with the common damned. All the attor
neys had to do was to ask this expert a i
question and he would go on an.l on like
Tennyson's brook, or more fittingly, his
testimony fell like filth from a broken
SOW6F. "
The prosecutor aJso argued that the de
fense's chief medical expert had shown a
violation of professional ethics in refer
ring during his testimony, to the case of
a prominent man, whose daughter sat in
the courtroom.
Mr Melvin will conclude his argument
to-morrow morning, and before the week
has closed the fate of the accused mur
derer will have been determined by the
twelve Jurors.
TISDALE AND BROWN
HAVE NOT YET MET
MUNICIPAL LEAGUE PROMISES
FURTHER SENSATIONS.
The Pugilistic Physician Will En
gage in No More Long-
Distance Interviews.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, March 22.
The rain has interfered with the prom
ised sanguinary conflict between Brain
ard C. Brown and School Director
Charles L. Tindale. The streets have
been deserted on account of the down
pour und neither of the belligerents de
sires to display his prowesa without a
good audience.
It is now known that the attack of Mr.
Brown on the Alameda School Board is
but the beginning of a series of charges
that will be fathered by the Municipal
League. That organization has appointed
a special committee to conduct the
School Board light and most sensational
disclosures are promised before the cam
paign Is over. The manner by -vhich
every teacher in the department received
his or her appointment Is being looked up
and the official acts of Directors fisdalo
and J. B. Lanktree are being very closely
Investigated. The members of the board
who are candidates for re-election profess
to welcome the attacks upon their pub
lic careers, but they have influential
friends at work with the leaders of the
Municipal League attempting to prevail
upon them to "call off the dogs of war."
This, however, the leaguo refuses to
do. It asserts thai its fight will be cen
tered on the School Directors, feeling that
a reorganization of the local department
is Imperative.
The Brown speech has been pretty fa
vorably received, but the opinion is freely
expressed that It would have been more
effective If Dr. Tisdale had not been sin
gled out for punishment, and J. B. Lank
tree made to share the burden of *he al
leged corruption in the School Depart
ment. The citizens are taking great in
terest In the controversy, and having re
ceived a taste of redhot politics relish It
and are hungry for more.
Dr. Tisdale is the most unhappy man in
the city. He has been classed among the
astute politicians, and yet is forced to
confess that he was neatly trapped by a
comparative amateur at the game. Ho
has taken an oath never to talk through
another telephone. As a matter of fact,
when he read Brown's version of the mid
night interview, when sparks of lire, ex
clamation points and terrible dashes flew
from the wires, he was convinced that he
had been talking Into a phonograph.
The physician is still wrathy over the
occurrence, but has not fully made up his
mind what to do about it. His threats of
criminal libel will not be carried out. He
has taken the advice of the District At
torney that such action would be very
f>oor politics. As fb doing- personal vio
pnee to Mr. Brown, the latter's willing
ness for an encounter has cooled the
1 doctor down somewhat and - those who
were looking forward to some rare sport
will probably be disappointed.
However, the matter Is by no means
settled, and no one will! be surprised If
some blood is spilled before election day.

OAKLAND, March 22.â Desertion is

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1899.
MANY NOW
OCCUPY AN
ANXIOUS SEAT
Knowledge of Guilt
Not Agreeable.
MAYOR SNOW IS HAPPY
HIS COLLEAGUES ABE NOT SO
PLEASANTLY SITUATED.
Not Likely That There Will Be Any-
Wholesale Changes in the
Police and Fire De
partments.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 22.
There are many employes of the city on
the anxious seat, nor can they ob
tain much satisfaction. The constitution
of the Board of Works is what is puz
zling these employes.
It is no secret that during the recent
campaign the Fire Department and the
Police Department were shamefully act
ive in politics, contrary to the rules gov
erning the members. It is known that
there are lists in the hands of interested
parties of the Individual members of the
department and for whom and against
whom they worked prior to election. It
is this knowledge that causes the present
uneasiness.
There will not, however, be any whole
sale changes. This is owing to the pecu
liar relations existing between the three
men who will compose the new Board of
Works. City Attorney Dow, if he felt so
inclined, would perhaps be justified in de
capitating half of the Police Depart
ment and as much of the Fire Depart
ment. Members of either body felt so
confident of his defeat tEat they openly
worked in behalf of his opponent. Should
Mr. Dow decide to administer his office
upon political lines these men know
what to expect.
City Engineer Clement knows that he
also was opposed by about half of each
department, but it was the other half to
that which opposed Mr. Dow. Mr. Clem
ent and Mr. Dow have disagreed for two
years on the board, and are no nearer
working in harmony than they ever were.
Consequently it is certain that Mr. Dow
will not help Mr. Clement to punish the
City Engineer's enemies, and Mr. Clem
ent is no more likely to help Mr. Dow
to visit reprisals on the City Attorney's
opponents.
Mayor-elect Snow, the other member of
the board, is the happiest of the trio.
So far as known no opposition was shown j
toward him by either the Police or Fire |
j departments. Apparently "they all stood
1 by him, and, therefore, he has â¢> ene
j iriies to punish and no workers to re-
I ward individually. It is not likely, there- j
fore, that he will vote with either of the
other two members to- do anything very i
radical, except it shall be shown that
! such a move would be for the good of the
i departments. Mr. Snow never was a pro
j grammer in the ordinary sense of the
term, and his success in politics has been |
largely, perhaps entirely, due to the fact ;
that he has conducted his own depart
ment of the city government for ten ,
years along rigid principles Independent
of outside Influences. There is no doubt I
he will pursue this method at the head ]
i of the government, and that he will re- j
| quire convincing arguments that changes j
! are desired simply for the betterment of |
the service and not to gratify political re
! venue or gratitude.
While it is almost certain that Deputy
Auditor Hinsdale will bo appointed sec
retary of the Board of Works when it
first meets, Mr. Hinsdale will not occupy
the position permanently. The permanent
successor to Harry Thomas has not yet
been agreed upon, and it is hardly likely j
that a choice will be made until the new ,
board gets down to business.
JOHN LYNN PLEADED
HARD FOR CLEMENCY
Fired Five Bullets Into His Wife a
Year Ago, but She Re
covered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, March 22.
"I can only pay that I am innocent.
God knows, I would not harm a hair on
my wife's head, much less attempt to kill
her. I am wholly unfortunate. Now that
I have recovered my reason I am about
to be punished for having lost it. If you
Bend me to the State Penitentiary an
awful stain will fall upon my little child.
I hope you will send me to the County
Jail."
This was the statement made by John
W. Lynn before Judge Ogden when the
latter" asked whether he had any valid
reason to give why sentence should not
be imposed. Lynn was charged with as
sault to murder his wife. On February' 1.
1898, he tired five builets into his wife.
Miraculously she recovered, and at the
trial she stated under oath that she had
no desire to prosecute, and that she had
signed and sworn to the complaint under
a misapprehension.
At the preliminary examination Lynn
had feigned insanity and was sent to
>Tapa for several months, but at the trial
Mrs. Lynn testified that she believed her
husband was in reality Insane when he
attempted to kill her. The jury last
Wednesday brought in a compromise ver
dict, finding the accused guilty of an as
sault with a deadly weapon, practically
declaring him sane.
When Lynn appeared in court to-day
for sentence his attorneys. Hugh Aldrlch
and J. E. McElrath. advised the court
that they were prepared to make a mo
tion for a new trial In case their client
be sent to the penitentiary. Judge Og
den however, replied that he believed the
ends of justice would be subserved by
imprisonment in the County Jail. This
obviously knocked out the case for ap
peal. Then addressing the prisoner at
the bar Judge Ogden said:
"If you were really unfortunate and not
criminal, It would be a crime to imprison
you even In the County Jail. But the
jury in your case has declared you sane,
and the evidence went to show you
guilty of assault to murder, with which
crime you were charged. However, I do
not wish to ruid any burdens upon you.
You are therefore sentenced to two years 1
imprisonment in the County Jail."
Lvnn received the sentence without
manifesting the slightest emotion. He
was immediately taken to the County Jail
to serve his time, which, allowing for
credits, means twenty months.
Funeral of J. T. Carothers.
OAKLAND, March 22.â The funeral of
J T Carothers, ex-Commissioner of Pub
lic Works, was held this afternoon. There
was no minister present, as the deceased
had expressed a wish that his brother
Odd Fellows should take charge of the
ceremony. The pallbearers were Stephen
T. Gage", R. A. Donaldson, Charles H.
Redlngton, Marshall Pierce, M. C. Chap
man Charles E. Snook, Edson F. Adams.
W. H. Miller, Charles W. Wllkins and
George E. de Golla. The remains were
placed in the Carothers vault in Mountain
View Cemetery, alongside those of his
only daughter.
Has But a Month to Live.
ALAMEDA, March 22.â Alexander V.
Henko of 2105 Clement avenue was taken
to Fabiola Hospital to-day to undergo a
surgical operation for a tumor on the
brain. Mr. Henko went to the German
Hospital in San Francisc-o laet week, but
the physicians there were not willing to
handle his case, and told him that he
could not possibly live another month.
He is now totally paralyzed and as help
less as a child. Henko was formerly a
prominent furniture dealer in San Fran
cisco.

calling the attention of the City Council
to the fact that one of the four special
attorneys was unable to fulfill the terms
of his contract. This idea was strength
ened somewhat when a circular was pre
pared for the Legislature three wÂ«ks
ago, asking for the insertion of a clause
in Senator Leavitt's bill, relating to the
Oakland harbor. This circular was sign
ed by only three of the four attorneys,
and the absence of E. J. Pringle's name
caused comment.
City Attorney Dow was asked this aft
ernoon if there was any truth in the
statement that Mr. Pringle is neglecting
to perform that for which he was paid
over four years ago. "I do not think so,"
he replied, "because all the real work
has already been done and Mr. Pringle
did his share of it. He will see, I am sure,
that the city does not suffer because of
his promotion. The matter now rests
upon briefs which Mr. Pringle helped
largely to prepare, and when the cases
are concluded 1 do not think there will be
any dissatisfaction with Mr. Pringle's
course."
Mayor-elect Snow said that he had not
heard of the matter till it was called to
his attention, but hinted that it would
seem as though some explanation should
be made to the city in view of the fact
that Mr. Pringle's contract was made
with the city through the committee of
the City Council.
The litigation has been once to the Su
preme Court, where a new trial was or
dered along certain lines clearly laid down
in the decision. It is now being sub
mitted on briefs a second time to Judge
Ogden. _
"THE GOOD-NATURED MAN"
AT SHATTUCK HALL
REVIVAL OF AN EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY DRAMA.
U. C. Students Appear In a Produc
tion of One of Gold
smith's Comedies.
BERKELEY, March 22.â A large college
audience gathered in Shattuck Hall to
night to listen to the production of Gold
smith's comedy, "The Good-natured
Man." The performance was an attempt
to present eighteenth century drama in
full eighteenth century style, the inter
est lying in the historical significance as
â much as in the plot, and judging from
the reception accorded it the whole went
off with remarkable success.
The play as given did not follow liter
ally the original of Goldsmith, but had
been recast for the occasion by Professor
L. Dv Pont Syle and Victor Henderson.
The very difficult task of altering an ac
knowledged masterpiece by condensing its
five acts into four and of slashing the
longer speeches for economy of time had
been done with the trained hand of sch< ', 1 1 7
arship, so that the abridged edition still
retained the distinctive eighteenth cen
tury elegance and grace of the original
without their falling a sacrifice to brev
ity The danger of presenting Goldsmith
up to date, in so far as it is avoidable,
had been admirably met by Professor
Svle in his reconstruction, and by careful
staging with appropriate furniture and
brilliant costumes the general tone of the
stage of the last century was maintained
with marked fidelity.
In one feature only was the work of
rearrangement subject to criticism. The
defect inheres possibly in the original as
written in five acts, but when cut down
to four it is only aggravated; the defect,
namely, of a signal lack of due subordina
tion of the minor plot to the major. Too
little prominence seemed to be given the
leading characters in comparison with an
undue importance assumed by the rest
of the cast. â¢
The tableau at the close of each act
could hardly have been adjusted better
by professional skill, and they were all
received with rounds of applause.
Although the acting, done by university
students, was the work of amateurs, the
peculiarly fortunate selection of a cast
naturally adapted to the parts taken left
little to be desired in the line of stage
work, even when judged by the best ama
teur standard. As Mr. Croaker Frederick
Blolettl made his third appearance in
eighteenth century plays, and his ren
dering of the character was inimitable.
Milton Schwartz as Mr. Lofty stepped
into his place with a natural fitness that
no training could have improved upon,
and his ease of manner showed up to good
advantage. Miss Lolo Jean Simpson as
Miss Rlchland and Miss L. E. Moller as
Olivia sustained their parts as the lead
ing women characters with noticeable
skill.
Following is the cast:
Sir William Honeywood, Harry H.
Hirst; Charles Honeywood. his nephew,
Arthur J. Elston; William Croaker, Fred
erick T. Bioletti; Leontine Croaker, his
son, Victor Henuerson: Mr. Lofty,
Milton H. Schwartz; bailiff, J. B. South
ard: Dubardieu, bailiff's follower, Fred
G. Dorety; Jarvis. Lawrence L. Greene;

DIVORCE TRIAL STOPPED.
Mrs. Kennedy, Plaintiff, Has Mys
teriously Disappeared, and
Grave Fears Are Held.
OAKLAND, March 22.â The sensational
divorce trial of Mrs. Catherine R. Ken
nedy against R. C. Kennedy was to-day
continued by Judge Ellsworth for two
weeks owing to the mysterious disappear
ance of the plaintiff.
During the noon hour yesterday Mrs.
Kennedy assaulted Mrs. Dr. Howe, a wit
ness for defendant, while the two last
named were enjoying lunch in a local
restaurant. Mrs. Howe immediately had
a warrant issued for Mrs. Kennedy's ar
rest for battery, and when the trial wa?
resumed Sergeant Scanlan was stationed
at the courthouse door to serve the war
rant, but Mrs. Howe's assailant failed to
materialize. . .
Mr Kennedy at that time requested
that the trial be continued until his wife
could be found. He stated that he fear
ed she might commit suicide, since she
had on divers occasions threatened so to
do. The trial, however, went on; but the
whereabouts of the plaintiff being still
unknown to-day, the trial was continued.
BURDENED WITH SORROW,
HER MIND GAVE WAY
MRS. JOSEPHINE TANZER BE
COMES A RAVING MANIAC.
Grieved Over the Tragic Death of Her
Son-in-Law, Robert
Conway.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, March 22.
After grieving for four months over the
tragic death of her son-in-law, Robert
Conway, Mrs. Josephine Tanzer has be
come a raving maniac and on Monday was
taken to a private asylum at Llvermore.
The unfortunate woman is the wife of
Adolph Tanzer, purser of the steamer
Acapulco, whose home is at 1209 Chest
nut street, Alameda. Mr. Tanzer left on
his steamer the day previous to his wife's
collapse and knows nothing of the unfor
tunate occurrence.
Robert Conway, the son-in-law, was
thrown from a narrow-gauge train at
Park street the evening of November 2
and was so seriously injured that he died
within a week without regaining con
sciousness. He was an especial favorite
of Mrs. Tanzer, who took his death very
much to hf>art. He and his wife had lived
at the family residence, 1209 Chestnut
street, since they were married.
From the time of the death the relatives
of Mrs. Tanzer noticed a marked change
in her demeanor. From a woman of
cheerful, happy disposition she became
morose, avoided her friends and relatives
and sat for hours sobbing and moaning
for her dead son-in-law. It was thought
that as time wore on her grief would pass
uway, but instead of regaining her for
mer self her grief became more intense,
until finally her mind gave way under the
burden of sorrow.
That her mind was failing became ap
parent last week. She threatened to end
her misery by throwing herself beneath
the wheels of a passing train, believing
that was the only way she could die and
join her son-in-law. Last Sunday her
mania took a serious turn and caused the
gravest fears among her relatives. Every
thing possible was done to quiet her, but
toward night she became violent and it
was found necessary to put her in a
f-traitjacket to prevent her doing her
self personal injury. On Monday friends
t"uk the unfortunate woman to the LJv
ermore Sanitarium.
Jt is stated that her case is not hope
less.

W"hen questioned about the cutting.
MARTIN SCHROEDER.
Bchroeder feebly declared that he did not :
know who had stabbed him.
"I was walking along the street," he
explained, "when I received the fatal
wound. I don't know who stabbed me, ;
nor can I tell where the cutting took
place. All I remember is that while
â walking along Seventh street I felt a pain
In my left breast, and placing my hand
in proximity to my heart, felt the
blood flowing from the wound. I stag
gered along the street h;ul finally fell in
front of the Girnrd House, where I was
picked up and pent to- the hospital."
Immediately after the cutting was re-
I to <"aptain Bohen h> detailed De- :
â  s Ryan, ODea nnd Crockett to
mak' 1 a thorough Investigation. They
visited the hospital and endeavored to
â wring from the wounded man the name
of his assailant, but without success. He
declared thai he was cut by a strangers
'â¢with whom he had had words. Con- :
vinced that he was determined to shield
the person who had cut him, the detec
isit.ii the Bcene where the stab
bing is su] â  :urred and
to make h careful investiga
tion. After interviewing a number of
people who saw Schroeder stagger along
the Btreet they ' nvlnced that he
'â¢was ell I ed by a woman who was !
'Jealous of him or a man with whom he
had had trouble.
Police Green, who is fa
miliar with the habitual criminals who
d the docks in the Police ;
. declares that Schroeder about
tw i weeks ago was before Judge Conlan
charged with vagrancy. He was allowed
..n his promise to leave the city at
once. _ . , ,
GrÂ«-Â»-n also says that Schroeder is an
ex-conVict and that his picture adorns the
rogues' gallery.
The wounded man, however, denies
that he was ever in State prison.
"Sergeant Green is mistaken this time,"
he r< marked.' when asked if Green's as
rertions were true. "I was never before
'Judge Conlan or any other Judge for va- ;
'gTancy nor have I served a term in the
entiary. I have been arrested for j
fbeing drunk on several occasions, but fur- !
ther than that I have never transgressed i
the li
Detective Crockett is inclined to be- i
lieve that Schroder had a row with a pal !
presumably over the division of spoils,
and w;is stabbed. Schroeder claims that
he is i mploy< d by the Oakland Water
Company and that he left Alvarado,
â¢where he had been working, last Tues- j
day, and came to this city. He admits he j
had been drinking heavily, patronizing a
number of saloons on the water front.
The surgeons at the hospital nre in- '
clined to believe that Schro<?der was
stabbed by a woman. When his wound i
â¢was being dressed h* remarked that he \
should have known better than to "take '
a chance with that woman " This re- â 
mark leads them to believe that a woman
figured in the tragedy.
I^atc last night Schroeder was in a dy
ing condition and the hospital surgeons
pave as their opinion that he would not
live many hours.
Favors General Improvements.
The West of Castro Street Improvement â 
Club at its meeting put Itself on record
as favoring general improvements all over
the city wherever the same shall be nee- j
essary for the health and accommoda- \
tion of the people. It was thought ad
visable to encourage the Supervisors to
stick to the dollar limit as closely as pos
sible: yet a generous distribution of the
available funds in the several depart
ments would leave a wide margin for
necessary and urgent improvements. The
district represented by the club was
pointed out as an example of the deplor
able condition existing among the people
In the outlying sections of the city with
regard to school accommodation. The I
â west of Castro street section had been
promised a new school building time and
again,' but so far there is no immediate
Bign of this promise being fulfilled. Be
tween the promises to build and the
breaking of them the children are de
Â§ rived of that which the laws of the
tate guaranteeâ an education in the pub

which permeates the whole valley with
an offensive dust and racket, was again
commented upon, and a request that the
Supervisors would see to It that it was

DESIRELLO IS
CHARGED WITH
WILLFUL MURDER
Quick Verdict of the
Coroner's Jury,
i
DRAMATIC RECITALOFDETAILS
JOHNSTON WAS KILLED IN COLD
BLOOD.
!
After Two Hours of Diligent Inquiry
the Inquest Was Terminated With .
the Terrible Accusation Against
the Deputy Sheriff.
We. the jury, find that James J
Johnston came to his death by a gun- '
shot wound in the neck at the hands â 
of one Fred Desirello. and we, the >
undersigned jury, hold Fred Desirello !
for willful murder in the first degree.
I Such w:i.< the verdict of the Coroner's i
jury of San Mateo County after two
hour? of diligent Inquiry Into, the circum
stances surrounding the shooting of
James Johnston, the 17-year-old boy, who
was shot down by Deputy Sheriff Fred!
Desirello at Colma last Saturday evening. !
The inquest was held in the town hall j
at Colma yesterday morning and was at- j
tended by a larg>' crowd of townspeople ]
anxious to hear the dramatic recital of
the horrifying details surrounding the;
murder. District Attorney Joseph J.
Bullock conducted the examination of
the witnesses to the tragedy.
Coroner James Crowe and his deputy,
Claude Fox, sat near the District Attor- !
| ney to assist him if necessary in the
questioning of the witnesses.
Mrs. Annie Gugtiemoni ami Miss iAicy
Johnston, sisters of the deceased, appear
ed ;it the Inquest in deep mourning- and
listt-ned with tears in their eyes to the
recital of the facts which told the story
of their brother's; untimely end.
Desirello was not present at the in
; quest. He was In a cell In the County
Jail at San Mateo, where he was safe
from the vengeance of the outraged citi
zens of Colma. The authorities telt that
it was best to keep twelve miles and sev
eral iron doors b< tween Desirello and the
: angry people of the little town where he ;
! committed the crime.
Dr. J. L. Ross of Redwood testified to
having made a post mortem examination
â on the body of young Johnston. Dr. K<>ss
siatcd that death was caused by shock
and hemorrhages, resulting from a bullet
wound in the neck.
The most important testimony of the
day was given by "Jack " Vaccari, the .
young man who drove the wagon In '
which his companion was shot. Vaccari
answered all of the District Attorney's i
questions In a deliberate manner, and his
examination brought to light facts that <
will probably be powerful agencies in the
conviction of Desirello when he is brought ,
to trial for the shooting of Johnston. <
Vaccari recited the story of the shoot- (
ing in full, leaving out absolutely nothing '
that had any bearing on the murder. The ,
bulk of his testimony was substantially '
the same -as that given The Call last Sat- <
urday night shortly after the murder. He '
testified as follows: "When we were
passing the: White House a man came out j
Into the road and then stepped back sev- \ .
â  eral feet. The horses were traveling at ,
a moderate rate of speed, not too fast,
and not too slow. I heard a shot tired,
but did not pay any attention to it until i
James Johnston shouted, 'Jack, somebody
Is shooting.' He then turned around and i
said, 'Jack, I'm shot.' Johnston jumped
out of the wagon and I stopped thti
horses and got out after him. He was
! lying on the sidewalk.
j â¢"Somebody In the crowd said, 'Send for â 
j a doctor." Desirello answered, 'It's too ;
i late.' I then said to him: "Fred, why
i did you shout at us? You had no right
to fire at us. We were doing no harm;
no danger. My horses were not going
fast. "iou knew well who we were.' I>â  -
: sirello then said to me, "You keep still or
I'M put a bullet through you.' A young
lady named Lily Ravn told me to say no
more for fear he would shoot nv. 1 then
left the place where Johnston was lying
and went as far as Ocean View for a doc
tor and brought him to the scene. When
we got there Johnston was dead."
Vaccari stated positively that the horses
I were not running fast and his testimony
on that point was corroborated by Henry
Jensen, a 16-year-old boy who was seated
In the center of the wagon. Vaccari fur- ,
tht-r testified that after Johnston was
shot the horses only wen; three or four |
yards before he stopped them. Henry j (
Jensen testified that he was looking back
and saw the flashes from the revolver In
inds* of Desirello. Jensen also cor- ,
roborated Vaccari's statement regarding ;
the threat Desirello made on the life of
I Vaccnri.
constable Pajiiel Thomas Nevilre then i
appeared before the jury and told the
story of Desirello's arrest.
Misses Ida and Lillian R;Â»vn both state, l
that they were coming from the station
when they were attracted to the scene of
' the shooting by the crowd in front of j
Belli' a grocery store, where the dying boy i ,
was Lying. Both heard Deslrelio say to
A accari, "You keep still or I'll put a bul
let through you."
Several other witnesses were also called
who testified to minor details.
The Inquest which was opened promptly
at 10 o'clock was closed at noon. Wnen :
the testimony was all Introduced Coroner j
.iam<-s Crowe arose and requested the
spectators to withdraw from the hall j
while the jury deliberated on their ver- j
i diet Just as soon as one of their num- j
' ber could write the verdict they all signed

trie hall again in less than five minutes to

QUICKLY FOLLOWED HIS
FRIEND TO THE GRAVE
John Christien Bruse, Who Died Yesterday After
a Short Illness.
JOHN CHRISTIEN BRT'SE. the well-known grocer nnd a prominent fra
ternal man, died at his residence, 1512 Ljeavenwbrth street, at 5 o'clock
yesterday morning after a short illness. His death following so quickly
after that of his closest friend, the late Dr. Frederick P. liuftc, is com
mented on by their mutual friends as a sad coincidence.
The demise of Dr. Muffe was a sad blow to Mr. Bruse, and within a few
days after his friend's funeral he was taken ill. He declined to have a
physician called, believing it was only a Blight attack, but the next day
was compelled to take to his bed. Dr. Osmun, the family physician, was
called in and ministered to Mr. Bruse and a few days later he was able to
sit up. He again had to seek his bed on Monday last, and early yesterday
morning, much to the surprise of his family, he passed away. Death was due
to a complication of kidney troubles, which were aggravated by the wet
weather. Mr. Bruse was 45 years of age at the Unit- of his death and was
seemingly in the prime of life. He hfrd occupied his place of business at
Pacific and Leavenworth streets for twenty years, and during that time mado
a host of friends who deplore his taking off. He leaves a widow and four
children to mourn his loss.
Mr. Bruse was one of the executors of Dr. Muffe's will and was appointed
by the latter to act as guardian for his child. He was a Mason and a member
of the San Francisco Schuetzen Vereln and Chosen Friends. He was also
secretary of the Consumers' Yeast and "Vinegar Company and a member of
the Franklin Building Association.

SURRENDERED
HIMSELF TO
AVOID ARREST
W. E. Boody Faces
His Accusers.
WAS WANTED BY THE POLICE
CAPITALIST ANDERSON ASKS
HIM TO ACCOUNT.
The Prisoner Admits His Wrong-
Doing, and if. Charged With
Embezzlement Will
Plead Guilty.
W. E. Boody, a real estate and insur- '
ant*- agent, with offices In the Mills
building, having been informed that De
.. Charlej Cody and Tom Gibson
were [u< king for him. visited she office of (
the Chief of Police last evening and sur
rendered himself. He was placed in the
"tanks" and was later visited by At tor- ;
ney Gavin McNab and H. F. Anderson, a I
wealth] English resident of Ben Lomond,
Santa ity, whose money Boody
hns handled in a number of land and
<>r ; ; .-r transactions.
Mr. McNab declined to make any state- ;
in the matter, but from other
sources it was learned that Boody. who is
the successor to the rial estate bi^
â¢if Alsip, the man who departed from
Sacramento ur,<-j,.i peculiar circumstances,
was the agent of Air. Anderson and as
such handled large sums to he Invested
in different transactions, tor which he has ;
not j et â -.
Mr. Anderson came to this city a week
ago i'"i the purpose or' having a pei
Interview with his trusted agent, but :
Boody, hearing of his coming, mil not go
to his office, tearing that he might leave
tin- .-.tan' without making a settlement,
Mr. Anderson visited police headquarters
and reported the state of affairs. De
tectives Cody and tiibson were detailed
on the case ami succeeded in locating
Boody in a house close to the Mills build
ing. Tlie latu-r, knowing that he would
i. sooner or later taken into custody,
voluntarily surrendered himself. No war-,
rant was issued for his arrest, and as he
Bhowed a willingness to stay in prison for
the time li.-ing he was accommodated
with a cot in tlie "tanks."
It is understood that Boody will not be
prosecuted tor an.) mistakes he has made
in handling his client's money, as Mr.
Anderson is both generous and wealthy.
I I.'- latter is desirous that various lanV
transactions be explained.
Aft. r Boody returned to the City I'rison ]
he gave an exceedingly vague statement
of Ins side of the case, lie \suuld not ad
mit that he had used any "i -Mr. Ander-
Bon's money for personal purposes, but
he did say that he would plead guilty if
that gentleman placed a charge of em
bezzlement against him. Boody's state
ment, as he gave It, is as follows:
"1 do not know whether Mr. Anderson
will place a criminal charge against me.
i !.â¢â !â ( is a difference between us as to
business ai unts, but i prefi :â  to let Mr.
Anderson make a statement in regard to
that. 1 have acted a.s business agent for
Mr. Anderson for the past two years, and j
until about six weeks ago we had no dif
ferences. About that time he returned
from a trip to England and asked for an \
accounting. lie- w;us not satisfied with
th>- result, and a few days ago, while 1
was ill and confined to my room, he com
plained to the police authorities. Yester
day 1 learned that the detectives were
looking for me and I came to the City
Hall and was imprisoned. As to the sums
involved, Mr. Anderson must give out ]
the amount. He Is the finest gentleman
1 have ever known, and whatever charge I
he may make I will sign my name to."
During the. two years Boody has acted
a.s Mr. Anderson's agent he has handled
large sums of money, loaning it mostly
on real estate mortgages. When tlie
Klondike rush began Anderson financed
an Alaskan tiansportatlon scheme.
Boody was tlie general manager, and it I
is in connection with this investment that |
the alleged embezzlement occurred. The !
si tamer Belle Kellock was built at a
cost of about $20,000, but she was never
put In commission. Since completion she
lias been lying idle at Benieia. When Mr.
Anderson departed for England about a
year ago he left a considerable amount
of cash in Boody's hands with which to
continue the Alaska project. On his re
turn the statement made by Boody in re
gard to the expenditure of this aroused
his suspicion. He demanded a complete
accounting, which was not forthcoming,
and he finally decided to place the mat- i
ter in tho hands of the law.
Boody is an unmarried man about 33 ;
years old. He was an employe of A. K. j
Alaip, the real estate agent, and sue- ' :
ceeded to his business. He formed a
partnership with Uilmore Slaven and the I
firm, Boody & Slaven, has been conduct-
Ing a regular real estate agency at room i
29, second floor Mills building. Boody j
lodged at 27 Post street, at which place '
the officers were unable to find htm for â¢
two days, although he says he was there ; :
ill. As nearly as can be learned. Boody's ;
alleged shortage approximates $10,000.

MYSTERY OF
THE DEATH OF
MRS. VANCE
Poisoned by Fumes of
Chloroform.
FRIENDS SAY AN ACCIDENT
MEDICAL MEN INCLINED TO BE
LIEVE IT WAS SUICIDE.
No Motive for Self-Destruction Is
Knownâ Coroner Will Make
Strict Inquiries
To-Day.
Shortly after noon yesterday Gratia
Vance, the young and pretty wife of Ira
Vance, bookkeeper in a downtown fur
niture house, was found in bed at her
home, *n Shrader street, with her head
Mink in a bowl containing chloroform.
A rhysician was summoned, but his ef
for were fruitless, as Mrs. Vance died
within an hour.
A great deal of mystery surrounds the
death. Members of the family
scout the idea of suicide, and although
no motive is apparent, it seems unrea
sonable that death could have been ac
cidental. In fact, Coroner Hill, who in
vestigated the rase in person, has order
ed Dr. Zabala, autopsy physician, to
make a far. -ful examination of the body
and an inquest will be held at the house ,
at 11:30 this morning.
The. story as given out by the family
Is as follows: !
"Mrs. Vance was employed at ( aswell s ;
millinery store on Post street. She has j
Ã¼bject to nervous headaches for a |
long time and has been in the habit of :
using chloroform to induce sleep when
attacked by the malady. Yesterday
morning the old troubl.- came upon her
and she left her work at about i<> o'clock
and went home. As she was going into
her room she met a woman who lodges
MRS. GRATIA VANCE.
in the house and told her that she was
sick and intended to try and get a little
sleep.
"At noon Mr. Vance went to meet her
as usual, but learned that she had gone j
home sick, and immediately started home :
to see her.
"He was met at the door by the lodger, j
who informed him that Mrs. Vance was
In bed and no response had been made to ]
repeated knocks. A doctor was sum- ;
moned and Mr. Vance entered the room.
He found that his wife had taken of:
her street dress, donned a black wrapper :
and gone to bed. Sho had taken with
her a small bowl in which wa.s a cushion |
saturated with chloroform.
"The doctor who answered the sum
mons worked for fully an hour, but Mrs.
Vance never regained consciousness."
Mr. Vance refused positively to speak
on tho matter, but thÂ»- foregoing is an
authorized statement by a friend of the
family.
Mrs. Vance left no letters to throw light '
on the case, and so far as can be learned
the marital relations- of the young couple I
were mor-t amicable. They have been mar
ried about ten months and took great de
light in furnishing the pretty home on
Shrader street.
The family say It was an accidental j
death, but medical men say it is almost
impossible for a person to accidentally j
asphyxiate himself with chloform. The
â human system will Involuntarily fight
against it with 'ho lust atom of strength.
Mrs. Vance's head was deeply buried in
the bowl, as though it had been deliber
ately forced thero. Her face was horribly
burned from con Act with the poison.
Mrs. Vance was 2f> years of age and
leaves a 3-year-old son by a former mar- |
riage. Her maiden name was Sklnivr.
and sho -was first married to J. C. Dunnr>,
n photographer. She procured a divorce
from him about two years ago and
cured a position in Heald's Business Col-
There sho met Ira Vance, then an
instructor in that institution. Friendship
ripened into love and the counle were |
afterward married. Friends of the family
say that the young couple have lived to
gether most happily and that there was
no reason why Mrs. Vance should have
taken her life.

Dollars on a Fictitious Check â Is
Quite Prominent.
G. W. Btealey, a yourp man of good
family, was arrested yesterday at tho in
stigation of i:,i Davaga, a pawnbroker,
for obtaining- money on false pretenses
Detective Clancy of Morse's Agency made '
the arrest and charged Steaiey with the
felony.
According to Davaga, the prisoner came
to him on tho Bth of the present month
and claimed that within a few days he
would come in fur a few thousand dollars
l..ft him by his father. Tho pawnbroker
believing his statement, cashed a check'
for one hundred d> 'liars, keeping, how
ever, out of that amount $n as his com
mission. At the request of Steaiey he did
not proffer the check at the bank until
two days later, when he was informed j
that there were no funds deposited in
St( aley's name.
The pawnbroker then hunted Steaiey
up. who. it is alleged, said he knew he
had no money coming to him from his
father's estate. Davaga, seeing no chance
of obtaining his money back, had Steaiey
arrested and charged as above stated
