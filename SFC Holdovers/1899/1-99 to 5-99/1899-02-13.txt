AGONCILLO ADVSED
AGUINALDO TO ATTACK
[>'â¢ "NEW YORK; Feb. 12JUThe Washing-'
"â¢on correspondent* of tie Herald tele
; " aphs: " -Agdnclllo'fl pncipit'ate . flight
torn Washington to Canada is officially
The San Francisco Call.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1899.
I explained by a dispatch sent by Gen-
I eral Otis to the War Department to
day. This dispatch stated it "was re
ported that the insurgent representa
tive at Washington telegraphed Aguin
aldo to drive out the Americans before
fee. am val of reinforcements.'' The
authorities through the secret - service
obtained information showing the
character of practically all the dis
patches sent to Aguinaldo. They re- I
garded the Filipino as too insignificant
to notice, and besides, the President did
not wish to influence the action of the
Senate upon the treaty of peace. Agon
<-illo was therefore allowed to believe
that he was sending dispatches to Phil
ippine Juntas and to Aguinaldo, but
few. of them reached their destination.
Anticipating that his advice would be
followed, he left this city on Saturday
night, February 5, believing he would
have ample time to reach Canada be
fore hostilities commenced, and from
Montreal proposed to cable the result
of the vote on the treaty of peace. It
was deemed wise to let him get out of
I the country, and so far as can now be
; learned it is not intended at present,
: at least, to make any representations
to the British Government to obtain
the expulsion of Agoncillo from Canada
; unless evidence should be obtained
showing that he is acting as a spy.
Besides General Otis states in his dis
patch that it "is reported" that Agon
cillo sent â¢â  f-eleerrsTn. ar- 1 tinl^ o'*0 '* 'Â»Â»"hi"
specific information . the authorities
could not take action. So far as the ;
two Filipinos here are' concerned, tnev
deny that they had any knowledge that j
such, a dispatch as that attributed, to â¢
Agoncillo was sent. " They are being
sharply watched and their* telegrams !
and mail are thoroughly examined be- ;
fore delivery: It is not proposed by the
authorities, however, to permit them
to aid Aguinaldo in this country, and
if they should attempt to do so they
will be expelled or placed under airest.
It is the expectation of the authorities
; that General Otis will take measures
to attack the force gathering twelve
miles north of Manila on the railway,
as the plan. under which he is proceed
ing is to destroy every organization of
insurgents reported to him.

I WASHINGTON, Feb, 12.-A dispatch
from General Otis received at the War
Department this morning says he has
been Informed that the attack made on
j the American forces by the rebels was
in pursuance of advices received by
Aguinaldo from Hongkong.
SAMPSON WILL NOT
BE SENT TO MANILA
". NEW* YORK, Feb. 12.â A Times spe
cial from Washington says: TheÃureau
I of Navigation of the Navy Department
j manifests amused surprise at the ru
mor that Admiral Sampson is to be
sent with, a fleet to. Manila. The
fleet at Manila, or Asiatic fleet, is con
sidered to be quite large and strong
enough for any possible demands on
the station.
There is no intention to make a gen
eral order to change the present fleet
of Admiral Dewey for another to be
picked out of the North Atlantic squad
ron. The Navy Department has. offered
to Admiral; Dewey to recall him and
grant him a leave' or new orders, but
the Admiral's request to be permitted
to remain on duty on the Asiatic sta
tion has been promptly compiled with.

The cottage was erected of stone and
granite walls with wooden interior and
intended for laundry purposes. Owing
to the crowded condition of the main
building forty of the female patients
were placed here in the laundry base
ment. The fire originated in the dry
room of the laundry. Here was a coil
of steam pipes, and the theory is that
either fine particles similar to lint set
tled on the pipes and Ignited, or that
clothes which were thickly hung close
by dropped on the pipes and were fired.
The -fighting of the 'fire wfts â¢ greatly
hin.derÂ«Â«i by loss of * power. The only
source of water was an artesian well
400 feet distant, the pipes for pumping
which ran through the cottage. The
intense heat soon caused these pipes to
burst, thus leaving the firemen without
power and * dependent entirely
and ammunition and need only rations.
They also state that they fought
Aguinaldo as allies of 'the Spanish.
An escaped Spaniard who has been
more or less a willing prisoner among:
the Tagallos, brings in the report that
Aguinaldo is still celebrating his al
leged victories. â¢ :-?

upon the direct pressure from the
tank. But two streams of water could
be thrown on the building and these did
but little good.
Fifty-two persons were in the build
ing forty patients and twelve attend
ants. The structure was three stories
and an attic high and had two en
trances. There was one stairway from
the second and third floors which led
into the main halls, thus giving but one
egress for those above the first floor.
Patients and attendants fled with ter
ror, confusion resulting, especially
among those on the upper floors.? Many
heart-rending scenes were enacted as
the inmates, clad only in their . night
clothes and barefooted, rushed down
the narrow flight of stairs and finally
out into the snow. â  The temperature
was 23 degrees below zero, and further
loss of life from freezing was prevented
alone by prompt work of the attend
ants from the main building. The at
tendants escaped, as did the others
who were saved, with none of their per
sonal effects, many losing all they pos
sessed.
Portions of charred remains can be
seen in the debris at the bottom of tha
basement which appear to be near tha
northeast wall. The work of removing
the remains and debris will begin in the
morning. The .four walls of stone still
stand, black and grim, and will make
the work of removal dangerous? as a
total collapse is liable to occur without
a moment's warning.- ??' - 7 '"

CALL HEADQUARTERS,. SACRA
MENTO, Feb: 12.â There is every rea
i son to .believe that the Southern Pacific
Company, having taken the matter of
a Senatorial caucus in hand, will at
tempt to force the members of the Leg
islature .to do what the corporation
wishes. â '.*. â  .
In other words, if the dictates of Col
lis P. Huntington, as promulgated in
â¢ the Record-Union and : other railroad
organs, are followed out it will be ap
parent that a majority of the Repub
lican members of 'the Legislature are
owned and controlled by Collis P.
Huntington and his 'political agent,
William, F. Herrin.
Huntington has directed his
ringmaster, Herrin, to crack the
lash and line up for Burns
every slave of the corporation in Cali
fornia. The issue of the Senatorial
contest is now clearly defined between
the people on one side and the railroad
on the othei". Simultaneously the or
gans of the corporation, beginning with
the Record-Union, of Sacramento, fol-Â»
lowed by the Oakland Tribune and sup
ported by every paper in California
that is controlled- by the road, cry for
a party council. or caucus to settle the
Senatorial contest by dropping the
lowest man in the list on each ballot.
The scheme emanated from the corral
of Burns and when the word was given
out to the touts that the railroad had
at length thrown . off its disguise and
openly proclaimed for the caucus, the
parasites began to boast of success.'
The Burns shouters even go so far in
their misguided zeal, or their supreme
confidence in the power of the railroad,
to call. off the names of Senators and
Assemblymen who must and shall be
whipped into line by the lash of the
ringmaster. The names of Senators
Simpson, ' Morehouse, . Luchslnger and
Dickinson, Assemblyman Cosper and
five others are mentioned as men who
will not.be allowed to further exercise
the right of individual choice in the
selection of a Senator, but must go into
a council . engineered by Dan Burns to
promote the election of Dan Burns.
Last evening there was a good deal of
talk in the Grant, Bulla and Barnes
camps in favor oorf r some reasonable
movement to break the deadlock, but
since the railroad managers have shown
their hands the sentiment has under
gone ;a? marked change. To-night the
Grant men are as resolute as ever that
Burns shall not be elected' United
States Senator. The Barnes ; men and
the Bulla men will not be hoodwinked
into the support of a scheme that prom
ises to , exclude by a machine process
â  " "'-". "^y-; PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the candidates who are not highest on
the list. ;?/. ? ?yy
For more than a month Dan Burns
has sought by every, means within his
power, and with the aid of the South
ern Pacific Company and the Repub
lican-State Central Committee, which
latter organization, has been turned in
to an agency for the promotion of
Burns' Senatorial" ambition, to secure
# his own election as United States Sen
ator. He has been unable to do so be
cause nine men out of every ten in the
State of California believe it would be
a lasting disgrace to the State if Burns
were selected to represent it in the up
per house of Congress, and a majority
of the legislators who have been sent
to Sacramento have not dared to cast
their, votes contrary to the wishes of
the people whom they represent.
Now that all other means have failed.
Burns has notified his political backer,
the Southern Pacific Company, that
the hope of â¢ election must be aban
doned unless the Republican legislators
can be forced into a caucus where the
secret ballot and the superior filibuster
ing abilities of such of his lieutenants
as Johnson and Dibble might . enable
him to achieve that which is beyond his
power to achieve on the floor of the
joint assembly, where every move he
may make is open to the scrutiny of
all who care to see.
y Heedful of its own Interests, the cor- '
poration that boasts of Burns as its j
Senatorial candidate has responded to !
this appeal by putting the screws on i
all the members of the Legislature who
can be. reached by its underground I
methods, and has supplemented its .ef
forts in this direction by calling upon
the members, through the editorial col
umns of its organ, the Record-Union,
to go into caucus and agree upon a can
didate for United States Senator.
- Ulysses S. Grant says unequivocally
that he will agree to caucus, but that
it must be on the floor of the Assem
bly and with no secrecy. He further
stipulates that the caucus, "if one jbe
had, shall be preceded by a general con
ference in which all the clans shall par
ticipate, but that none of them shall
be bound by any decisions that shall
come of it. Mr. Grant does say. how
ever, that he will abide by any decision
obtained by the open caucus and will
consent to stay it until the present
difficulty; is settled one way or" an
other. '-. yyy-yy-y?
The San Diegan, however, arrived at
this conclusion alone and single-hand
ed. His present followers are not with
hlra; not as a unit at any rate. There
may be some among them who will con
sent to go in, but one factor that has
developed during " the past few days
stands in the way of any such agree
ment on the part of a good many of the
balance.' That potent factor is Thorp- .
as R. Bard, of Ventura, for whom
Thomas Flint, president of the Senate,
has ' been voting since the first joint
ballot. Nearly a dozen of Grant's sup
porters who hail from the .counties
south of. and including Santa Cruz are
pledged to â  the Verituran as second
choice, and they are largely Inclined to
stand upon their pledges: Until they
can come to some agreement that will
assure Bard of a fair chance in cau
cus they will not consent- to any such
proposition. Grant knows this as well
as any one in his camp.,, and when he
says he will caucus he â  speaks ' solely
for himself, although ' it. is probable
-that Assemblymen Crowder and Works' â 
and Senator Nutt will stand- with him
on any proposition he -is forced into
making. Concerning the balance of his â¢
votes, Mr. Grant- in an interview' has.
the grace to say that he does not think
he can control them if he should, try .
to. At the same time he says that he
will not try. If he cannot win he will,
not try to direct his strength. 'So much
for Mr. Grant. : y.y- â¢
Senator Bulla, . on the other, hand; '
says he will not caucus if it be the
price of his election as Senator. The "
doughty candidate from the southland
says he does not see . what can. be
gained by a caucus, secret or otherwise,
more than has already been won on
the open floor in the half hundred joint
ballots that have been taken. â¢'â¢ Like Mr. .-
Grant, Mr. Bulla- does not speak for
his supporters. -There" are a half dozen â¢
of them who are anxious 'for anything
that will .settle, the- matter for one or â¢
the other of those in- the field. Melick
of Los Angeles has gone so far that â â¢
he is broaching a plan of caucus" that
is - meeting with considerable favor,
albeit it is as unique a political pro
ceeding as has been brought .out in the
open. Melick wants a general-clean
ing up, a dice-shaking proposition, with *
the low man out? or one tie all. tie. He
proposes that â¢ first a general confer- .
ence, which shall bind no*. one "to any
thing, shall be held and some agree
ment reached .Upon the proceeding to
follow. Then proposes that on the
floor of the Assembly the clans shall
come together in the fullness of their -
strength, . agree to be bound by the ul
timate decision and then hold succes
sive ballots until all but, one of the con- .
testants is frozen out. . .
On the first ballot, according to'" Mr.
Melick's plan, the one receiving the
lowest number of votes is to retire
from the field, leaving his strength ' to
go where fancy dictates.- The second ,
ballot will drop the next low man, and
so on until they are all bowled down
but one and he will be proposed as the
caucus .nominee in open session and
duly elected. '":.-'â¢*-
It is said - that Valentine of Los An-'2
geles has â  expressed considerable ad
â¢ miration for -the plan .of " Mr. Melick,
' but when questioned, .he refused' to say j
anything .about- his stand on caucus j
" matters. A"' number of other. Bullaites,
' â  however, are quite free; to say that the
plan Is a good one and that they will
' support .-it -if an agreement to that ef
. feet can- be? reached.. And for no ob
>â  are reason the. present tail-enders in
the fight are General Barnes and Bulla.:
Barries' polls. -eleven votes and Bulla
â¢ thirteen: Besides, Bulla claims he" will

-' Brown- of San Mateo; who is understood
. to' be inclined, to Barnes. Barnes,, of- a

Belief That the Proposed Enactment
Was Introduced in the Interest
of a Water Com
pany.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA. Feb. 12.âSena
tor Dickinson of San Francisco recently
introduced the following bill, which in
terests the city of Santa Barbara alone,
but to what extent and in what man
ner it is difficult to tell at this time:
An act to amend an act entitled "An
Act to Establish a . Political Code," by I
adding a new section thereto, to be known j
and numbered as section 3524, relating to '
land patents.
The people. of the State of California,
represented In Senate and Assembly, do
enact as follows:
' Section 1. Where any patent has here- j
tofore been issued, purporting ' to be a,
grant of land by the State of California, <
the purchase price for which land has
been fully paid to the officer authorized â¢
by law to. receive such payment, but the !
issuance of- which patent was irregular or
premature, the said land not having been
surveyed under the authority of the ;
United States, or the title to said land
not having vested in the State prior io
such issuance, the said patent and the
execution and issuance tnereof are here- !
by ratified and confirmed as a valid con
veyance of said land, and the title of the
State to said land acquired subsequent to j
the issuance of said patent shall inure to
the benefit of the grantee in said patent
named, and to his successor or succes- |
sors in interest, and shall vest in them
as though said patent were in all respects
regularly issued subsequent to. the ac- j
quisition of said title by the State.
Judge R. B. Canfield, a prominent
lawyer of this city and president of the
Santa ' Barbara Water Company, and
George H. Gould, an attorney : and
president of the Montecito Water Com
pany, are the fathers of the- bill. This
city has gone to very great. expense in
driving a water tunnel into the moun
tains near by to obtain sufficient
water for domestic purposes and other
needs of the city. The land upon which
the tunnel is situated is held under a
State patent. Canfield and Gould hold
a section along the city tunnel and ad
joining it, but their title to ' this was
got by a United States . patent. Below
this and also adjoining the city tunnel
they have . another half- section which
they, like the city of Santa Barbara,
hold under a State patent. . If this bill
is intended only to secure the title to
this latter half section held under State
patent and also that held by the city
and upon which the city tunnel is situ
ated well and good; but if Canfield has
a State patent to the section, of land
above the tunnel and adjoining it (there
is. no such patent on record) then a
scheme is apparent on its face:
There is a suit now pending, entitled
the City of Santa Barbara vs. R. B.
Canfield and George H. Gould, to con
demn whatever interest, if any. Can
field and Gould have in this section of
land, which they .hold under United
States patent. There is a question '
about the Validity of the United States j
patent.- There is also a question as to J
whether the State patents to both Can
field and the city were not prematurely
issuedâ that is, before the survey was
made and approved; and the proposed <>
act would ratify .and confirm these
State patents.
.The lands affected by these various
patents are the west half of southeast
quarter of section 25 and the west half
of. section 36, township 5,. range 27 west, . â¢
San Bernardino meridian. .. . , - '?;
The fact that neither Canfield nor
Gould has volunteered . information to
the Mayor, City Attorney or any one
interested in the city's welfare, and
also the fact that the bill is a very
blind one, have led many to be bus-
picious of the proposed act. The Santa
Barbara Water Company has been de
prived of thousands of dollars of their
yearly profits by the city's water man
agement, and it was feared the com
pany wished to obtain title to enough
land near the city water tunnel to drive
a tunnel of its own and thus drain the
city's tunnel. This it could do If its
title to the section now held under a
United States patent were held by a
, State patent also, and made secure by
the Legislature of " California. The sec
tion held by the company below the
water tunnel is too small to permit the
beginning of operations, as the tunnel
would have to be 2000 or 2500 feet in
length. -"
City Attorney McNulta and Mayor E.
M. Burke have gone to Sacramento and
will investigate thoroughly.

Attorney General's
Advice to Gage.
SAID THEY SHOULD BE PAID
;
TWO COURSES OPEN FOR THE
GOVERNOR TO PURSUE. "'',.
Bills for Advertising Constitutional
Amendments Should Have
Been Sent to the Con
troller.
â¢ CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 12.â refusing the claims
of the newspapers for the advertising of
constitutional amendments, Governor
Gage did not act on the advice of Attor
ney General Tirey L. Ford. The only
consultation he had with his legal adviser
was over the telephone, and y. was a short
one. /y; :'â  . â¢-.â ;;.y-.-
He asked his limits under the law, and
the Attorney General gave him these:
Mr. Ford advised the Governor that he
could adopt one of two courses. He could
allow the claims and have them tested by
the Controller, and the Controller, by re
fusing to sign the warrants' for them,
could at once bring the matter before the
courts and there make it a question of
law. 7 7;y7;..y: â-'-'?-?; ?*T ; :'
Declining this course the Governor
could refuse to allow the claims and then
they, would come before the Legislature
and would have to depend upon the de
cision of that body for payment. ' The
first was the strictly legal course. The
latter was one involving purely questions
of fact, . and necessitating 'a fight before
the Legislature.
"Personally, I was in favor of allowing
the claims' to be passed by the Legisla
ture," said the Attorney General to-night,
"and then if the Controller refused to pass
them they could be fought out in the
courts. ; â¢ <ry7/..' "
"I advised also another course which Is
possible under the law. The Governor
may refuse to pass the claims, as a mem
ber of the Board of Examiners, thus com
pelling a separate bill to be introduced for
the advertising account of each paper. I
did not advise the Governor - to follow
either course, I merely suggested the two
methods possible.
"Soon after -I spoke to the Governor
over the . telephone, I was called up by
JUdge Post, my head deputy, who, in my
absence, acted as a member of the Board
of Examiners^ He asked my advice on
the matter and I gave him my authorities
and told him I would stand by any ac
tion he might take. I should have been
in favor of testing the matter -through
the Controller.
â  "I ..think it is the easier way and a
shorter, but the case was out of my
hands when I outlined to the Governor
the courses open to him to pursue. So far
as the claims are concerned, I believe
those authorized by Governor Budd
should be paid, and 1 so advised the Gov
ernor, as that is a mere matter of con
tract- They were ordered by the chief
executive and the amendments so directed
to be published were printed in good faith
by the newspapers. I think they were
valid contracts, and I advised the Gover
nor in the brief talk we had that he
should allow them. , â  , . . â 
"I do not care to pass judgment on the
opinion touching this matter which was
rendered by my predecessor in office."

SPECTATORS WITNESS SOME
HARD COURSES.
Mystic Maid and Mira Monte. Chase
â¢ a Lively "Jack" for Nearly
Five Minutes and Pinal
ly Kill Him.
Bartels Brothers' Mac's Melody ran in
superb form at Ingleside yesterday and
added another stake to his already good
â record. Pitted against him were some
famous hounds, but due to the clever
handling 1 by. J. P. Thrift his present
trainer, the white dog downed them all.
His victory was a -disappointment to the
"talent," who picked Rocket to land the
stake. Their judgment was heavily back
ed, and when Rocket was put out by Jen
nie Wilson,, the runner up in the stake,
there was deep wailing. This might not
have come to pass had not their .choice
stumbled in the course, as he was leading
the bitch by many lengths. According to
those who were in the field Rocket fell
against the fence and was partly dazed
when the points were 9- to 7in his favor.
Before he could recover himself Jennie
Wilson scored- two more and killed.
The long course between Mystic Maid
and Mira Monte was the actual feature
of the day. ; The hare led the hounds up
arid down the grand stand for four min
| utes and thirty-eight seconds, and sought
j safety in Slip Steward Halpin's paddock,
; but his relentless pursuers followed him
i in there and ended his existence, while
he was crouching against the fence.
Despite her long course against Black
i Hawk on Saturday, Glen Cnloe showed
! great speed in yesterday's running, beat
| ing Brilliantine and Royal Duke in hard
I courses before succumbing to Jennie Wil
i son. Her work was considered marvelous
i by coursing experts, and Mr. Deckelmari
I was congratulated on possessing such a
I good bitch. . . â â¢

In the final course for the stake between
i Mac's Melody and Jennie Wilson both
dogs were slipped to a speedy hare. Mac.
j Melody led by three lengths, taking the
I first and second turns, placing Jennie for
| one point, and : keeping possession for
; eight more, when he drove the prey to
Handy & Smith's bitch for a turn and
killed, making the score 12 to 4.
Although a heavy fog rolled in about
! 3 o'clock in th. afternoon, : strange to

Coursing at Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. J 12.â Beautiful
weather brought out a large crowd to wit
ness the coursing at Agricultural Park
to-day, and the sport was first class in
every respect. It was essentially a "short
end" day, and the phenomenal perfrom
ances of some of the dogs that have never
been able to get the flag caused consid
erable comment. But at no time during
the day was there a question as to the
justice 'of the decisions, and even when
the talent was dumped hard there was no
kick.
- Passon's Merry Maiden won first money,
with Waddington's Rosewood second and
Ohmeyer's Fleetwood third, the rest di
vided. Moloch ran in fine form, and Nash
ville went down into the third ties.
RARE OLD MANUSCRIPTS
AND BOOKS DESTROYED
Eire at Chicago Entailing a Loss of
Nearly Three Quarters of a
Million.
CHICAGO, Feb. 12.â five-story brick
building at the northwest corner of Wa
bash avenue and Madison street, occu
pied by the book and stationery firm of A.
C. McClurg & Co.? was, with its contents,
totally destroyed by fire to-day, entailing
a loss of nearly $650,000, of which $500,000
was on the stock. The insurance was"
about $350,000. j McClurg & Co. carried one
of the largest stocks of rare old books and
manuscripts outside the great libraries.
The fire was started by an explosion of
gas on the third floor and spread with
amazing rapidity. The firemen from the
first had no hope of saving the building,
and directed their efforts to preventing
the flames . spreading. Considerable dif
ficulty was experienced on account of the
low water pressure, many of the hydrants
being partly frozen. The temperature was
several degrees below zero, and a bitter
north wind was blowing. Many of the
firemen were severely frost-bitten.
About two hours after th* fire started
the Madison street wall fell out, tons of
debris crashing into the street and break
ing many large plate-glass windows on
the opposite side. . Several of the firemen
had narrow, escapes. " ' ...
Mandel Bros.' dry goods store across
the alley suffered a loss of about $10,000.
BOLD BURGLARY
ON BOARD THE
SHIP DRUMMOND
Thieves Loot a Cap
tain's Cabin. j
MONEY AND JEWELRY TAKEM
CRIME WELL PLANNED AND
BOLDLY EXECUTED. .
The Police Are Notified and Efforts
Are Being Made to Apprehend
the Perpetrators of the
Bobbery.
Captain James F. Skewes of the Amer
ican ship James Drummond, reported at
the Harbor Police Station last evening
that his cabin had been entered by burg
lars, who got away -with nearly 1500 in
coin and two bracelets valued at $150.
Two officers were immediately detailed
to return to the ship with the Captain,
and a brief investigation of the interior of
the cabin disclosed undisputable evi
dences of the work of daring thieves.
Despite the fact that there was a watch
man on board at the time the burglars
got away with their plunder unseen, and
the robbery was not discovered until the
commander returned to his vessel from a
trip up. town. 7. .. â¢",.-.
The thieves evidently had carefully
planned their visit, as they did not*
go aboard until the crew had either left
the ship or gone to bed. As soon as the
watchman had gone below on a tour of
inspection, they steathily sneaked up the
gangway and hid In a dark corner until
a favorable moment, when they entered
the cabin and perpetrated their crime.
The money is said to have been in sov
ereigns and the stolen bracelets are de
scribed as being of Chinese workmanship.
In their hurry to get away, the thieves
overlooked the captain's barometer, a
telltale compass and other articles used
in navigation. .
The Drummond is anchored at Howard
pier No. 1. She arrived * here .on
the 15th of January, with a general cargo,
and after discharging will sail for Cork.
WAR VETERANS IN
THE NATIONAL GUARD
â
BILL TO WAIVE THEIR AGE
DISQUALIFICATION.
Companies Depleted by Members
Joining the Volunteers May
Still Draw Their Annual
Allowance.
The election of officers for the engineer I
division of the naval militia which had
been ordered for the 14th inst. has been
postponed to Friday, the 17th.
First Lieutenant E. H. Hutchinson,
quartermaster, Seventh Regiment of In
fantry, First Battalion, has tendered- his
resignation and it has been accepted, to
date from the 10th inst.
Notwithstanding the fact that citizens
of Santa Cruz have donated a site for a
permanent camp for the guard of this
State and that those interested have
gone home with the assurance , that it
will be accepted, a bill lias been intro
duced in the Assembly providing that the
adjutant general, the major general and
the senior brigadier general of the guard
shall be appointed to select a suitable
site at or near the city of Santa Cruz
and to make a selection within ninety
days from the passage of the bill.
Another bill, that has for its purpose
the enabling of veterans of the Civil War
to become part of the National Guard,
has been Introduced by Senator Strattoit,
and it has the sanction of the Commit
tee on Military Affairs. It amends a
section of the code and provides that
every able male inhabitant of the State,
except Mongolians and Indians, between
the ages of 18 and 45, not exempt by law,
is subject to military duty, provided that
any military organization having the
minimum required to constitute a com
pany, composed of veterans of the Civil
War, â¢if upon required examination be
found capable of efficient service to the
State in the performance of active, gar
rison or other military duty may be or
ganized and mustered into the military
service of the State, notwithstanding the
members thereof may be over the age of
45, and become a part of the guard.
In the details of the opinion which At
torney General Tirey L. Ford gave to
Adjutant General .Peeler" last week he
says that the Political Code provides for
a Board of Location and Organization,
with power to disband companies and to
reorganize at pleasure regiments and bat
talions; that the code provides the man
ner in which individual members of the
guard may be discharged, but does not
mention the contingency provided in sec
tion 1962, which provides that each com
pany of infantry shall not have less than
fifty nor more than one hundred, and
three officers, non-commissioned officers
and privates; that the code provides "that
the commander-in-chief may at any time
for good and sufficient cause disband any
portion of the National Guard; that all
enlisted men on entering the guard must
take the oath and join for not less than
three years' service, provided that any
man having served one enlistment satis
factorily may re-enlist for one, two or
three years, at his option; that any com
pany parading at parade with less than
thirty-two men, rank and file, may be
disbanded by the commander-in-chief;
that any company failing to re
port for annual camp, etc., may be

that it is a masterly document. "

PITCHED BATTLE

With Bullets.
FIGHT IN A RESTAURANT
COLONEL OF THE FOURTH KEN
TUCKY WOUNDED.
He Pulls the Ear of a Subordinate
and Pistols Are at Once
Brought Into
Play.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANNISTON, Ala., Feb. 12.â 111-feeling
between Colonel David G. Colson and
First Lieutenant E. P. Scott of the
Fourth Kentucky Regiment, culminat
ed at midnight last night in a pitched
battle, in which Colonel Colson was
shot in the hip and Lieutenant Scott
and many others had narrow escapes.
The trouble opened when Colonel Col
son entered a restaurant where Lieu
tenant Scott and Lieutenant Blake
man, also of the Fourth Kentucky,
were seated at a table, and deliberately
pulled Blake-nan's ear. at the same
time applying a vile epithet. Lieuten
ant Scott declared he would not allow
his friend Blakeman to be Insulted. At
this Colonel Colson drew a pistol and
Lieutenant Scott arose from his chair
with a pistol in each hand. 'â _ V
There were quite a number of men
in the place, and while some say they
do not know who fired first, several
declare that Colonel Colson opened the
fight. Probably a dozen snots were
fired before the astounded, onlookers
could stop the fusillade. Lieutenants
McKay and Phelps, of the Fourth Wis
consin, on duty with the provost guard,
were in the room. Lieutenant PhelDS
ran up to Lieutenant Scott and de
manded his pistols. The latter said he
willingly, relinquished them to . the
proper authorities and gave them up.
Lieutenant McKay, in the meantime.
had ordered Colonel Colson to disarm,
but he refused to do it. and the pistol
was taken from him by force.
Quick as a flash Colonel Colson drew
another weapon and fired, some say at
Lieutenant Scott and others at Lieuten
ant McKay, but, without, effect. The
provost lieutenant then bent his efforts
toward getting Colonel Colson's pistol,
and in doing so struck Colonel Colson
twice with his fist, bruising his face
very badly. Strangely enough Colson
was the only one wounded. An exam
ination disclosed that a bullet had.en
tered his hip and ranged around to the
rear, .where it was located and ex
tracted. l^ffSÃ9__3MKni
A friend of Colonel Colson swore out
a warrant for Lieutenant Scott and he'
was arrested to-day. Both officers have
many warm personal friends in the
regiment, and as further trouble was
feared, the entire provost guard was
ordered out. Their services were not
needed, however. â¢
LEXINGTON, Ky., Feb. 12.âLieuten
ant Scott, who shot and wounded Colo
nel Colson at Anniston, is a citizen of
Lexington. The ill-feeling that existed
between the two officers was well
known here.
Lieutenant Scott is a nephew of Gov
ernor Bradley, but the two have not

NEW GOLD FIELD
AT THE SOUTH
El Dorado in Riverside
County.
MANY CLAIMS STAKED OUT
DISTBICT LOCATED SOUTHEAST
OF HEMET.
Discovery Was Made by Accident,
but the Lucky Prospectors
Failed to Bealize on
Their Find. . ' : \
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12.â The new
gold field which has recently been dis
covered in the southern part of River
side County is causing considerable ex
citement, and is attracting much atten
tion from investors, mining experts and
prospectors.
This discovery of gold-bearing ledges
Is in the Mountain Beauty mining dis
trict, which skirts the foothills of the
Chihuahua Mountains, being a spur of
the southern end of the San Jacinto
Mountains. The district is partly in
San Diego County and partly in River
i side County. The district is forty miles
j south and east of Hemet. The nearest
J point to the district is Oakwood post
office, which is reached by stage from
| Hemet. At Oakwood is a tavern and
| several stores. These supply the wants
I of the ranchers who grow crops and
| raise cattle in the many sheltered spots
of the canyons.
The formation in the district is gran
ite and schist, the country rock being
cut by huge dikes of granite. The mi
nor formations, in a thousand and one
forms, which delight the student and
puzzle the layman, are not lacking.
The trend of the lodes is from the
north to the south. These have been
: traced to the Mexican border. Where
| locations have been made the croppings
I are strong, of great width, possessing
I every appearance of permanency.
These combinations that have at
tracted a large number of people to the
; newly discovered gold district may be
j .the cause of opening a mining excite
ment such as Southern California has
not experienced in many years.
The discovery of the gold ledges is,
. like many another gold discovery, the
i result of an accident. In December,
! 1896, Johnson and Savage, who had
I prospected together, for years, entered,
j during a storm, one of the canyons, and
pitched their camp at the base of a
foothill. The top of the hill was
crowned with an imposing cropping,
i which appeared not unlike a giant in
; the center of his rock-ribbed domain.
' These two pioneers, who traced the
float, sampled the ledge, which could
be traced on the surface for hundreds
! of feet.
No matter" where they tested the
| ledge gold was found in the hornspoon.
i Quartz taken at random demonstrated
1 the same results. They sank a shaft
I and drifted into the claim. The quartz
j from the workings showed the same re
: turns in gold.
"This is a beauty," said Johnson, as
he raised a huge. chunk of ore.
"This whole mountain is a beauty,"
j replied Savage.
"The 'Mountain Beauty* is her
! name," said the partners. The records
show the wish of the hardy pioneers.
Johnson and Savage erred in mining.
| They left the ore as they followed the
footwall. Piscouraged and disheart
ened, they gave up the work, believing
! that the ore had pinched out. Other
people took up the work, and the re
sults show that what is probably the
biggest ledge of free milling quartz in
this portion of California has been un
covered.
The two tunnels on the Mountain
Beauty are in ore. A winze, 5x6 feet,
has been raised in the ore chute. In a
crosscut, 20 feet wide, which is all in
ore, no hanging wall has so far been
encountered. The fairest tests of sam
pling yield from all parts, of the proper
ty a general average of $10 a ton in
gold. Many samples go into the hun
\ dreds.
Many claims have recently been lo
cated, including the Annex, Jessie L.,
Maria. Helen, Progress, North Exten-
sion. South Extension, Alturas, Golden
Link, Virginia, Valley View, Lizzie,
and others. Prospecting on these claims
shows the same results in free gold and
the same character of quartz.
The two essentials, water and fuel,
are found in abundance. The water is
a small stream. which seeps from under
the base of a mountain in one of the
canyons. The fall is such and the num
ber of Inches sufficient to afford power
for electricity i and for all reduction
works to handle the ore.
The mountains are covered with ce
dar. The damp grounds show a heavy
growth of sycamore. On the plains are
mesquite and manzanlta. The size of
the timber will permit of it being used
for mine purposes.
STREET RAILWAYS FOR JAPAN
American Syndicate to Put in Under
ground Electric Systems.
TACOMA. Feb.. 12.â Dr. W. P. Eastlake
is here en route from New York to Japan.
He says an American syndicate has been
formed to expend millions in providing
modern electric street railroads for Ja
pan's large cities. Because of lack of cap
ital Japanese cities have been very slow
in providing rapid transit. Meanwhile,
tney have been watching the growth of
American systems, with the result that
those in power are Inclined to favor the
underground trolley system. Two native
companies have applied for charters, but
their capital is small.
Toklo has one horse car line. It is four
and one-half miles long and pays annual
dividends of 3.=. per cent on Â«â  capital of
1,500,000 yen. This encouraging fact has
enabled Pr. Eastlake to interest Eastern
capitalists, who. he says, are willing to
invest up to $40.0<a>.000 in industrial enter
prises in Japan. Dr. Eastlake has lived
in Japan for years. It win now devolve
upon him. together with his brother. Pr.

ROCKFORD, 111.,- Feb. 12.â At the Instance of William Whitney of
Santa Barbara, Cal., Congressman Hitt has started an investigation
through the State Department at Washington to ascertain the where
abouts of Ira Whitney, of this county, believed to be incarcerated in
a Siberian prison. Whitney's home is at Rockton, and his father, who
lives at Santa Barbara, goes down to the beach every day and looks
across the ocean, begging for the return of his lost son, whom he has
not heard from several years. Young Whitney, who was an expert
rifleman, sailed on a schooner from San Francisco with Frank J. Bass
ford of Vallejo, Cal., and others. The schooner was wrecked in Bering
Sea, and Bassford is said to have been picked up by a Russian gunboat,
and is now a prisoner in a penal settlement in Siberia for poaching on
the .Russian fisheries. It is believed Whitney is with him. Congress
man Hitt has promised a vigorous search for him, and redress for what
ever wrong he has suffered.
NICARAGUA BILL
SEEMS DOOMED

Time During the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 12.â The House
will have little or no time during the
remaining three weeks' of the session
to devote to anything except appropria
tion bills. The announcement of Chair
man Cannon that there was not time
to consider the steamship subsidy bill
and the Nicaragua canal bill settles the
fate of the former. The friends of the
latter are to try a flank movement by
attempting to attach the canal bill to
i the sundry civil bill, now under consid-
I eration. As it will be the only chance
1 the bill will have at this session, its
! supporters will make a desperate fight.
i Time must be given for the considera-
I tion of the bill for the Government of
j Hawaii; but it also, for the present,
' must give way to the appropriation
i bills. Five of the great annual budgets
â  still remain unacted upon by the House,
I and as they are the most important of
the appropriation bills, it will require
practically all the remainder of the
session to put them through and con
sider the conference reports upon the
I other appropriation bills as they are
! brought In.
During the earlier part of the session
the opposition was passive, but it seems
to have been aroused by the debate on
the army reorganization bill and within
i the past week has become quite aggres
| sive. The threats of an extra session
appear to hold no terrors for the Dem
ocrats and the Populists; indeed, some
of them would apparently welcome it,
especially if it were called to increase
the size of the regular army.
As an unembarrassed proposition, the
Nicaragua canal bill would doubtless
command a very strong majority in the
House, but with the power of the Ap
propriations Committee and the threat
I of a bond issue thrown into the balance
against it, and the likelihood that to get
a direct vote upon it will require a re
versal of the ruling of the chair, It is
exceedingly doubtful whether it can
carry.
The promised effort on the part of the
Committee of Military Affairs to get
immediate consideration of the army
I reorganization bill promises to be the
, most important feature of the proceed
' ings of the Senate during the present
week. Lines are divided very sharply
I on this bill, and the contest over Its
I consideration unquestionably will be
both fierce and stubborn.
The Democrats, not only on the Mili
tary Committee, but throughout the
Senate, will resist any effort to get the
army bill through. They say, however,
they will not try to prevent considera
tion of the bill.
The army bill has not yet been re
, ported to the Senate, but there will be
an all-day session of the Committee on
| Military Affairs on Monday, with the
| hope of concluding the consideration of
the bill in committee and of having it
ready to report on Monday or Tuesday.
The probabilities are, however, that it
will not get into the Senate before
Wednesday.
Another question which bids fair to
provoke considerable controversy is
that Involved in Senator Hawley's no
tice of a motion for the reconsideration
of the unanimous consent to Senator
Mason's proposition to vote on the Mc-
Enery resolution at 2:30 o'clock Tues
day. Senator Hawley had objected to
the consideration of this question when
it came up Saturday, and he was ab
; sent when the agreement was reached.
j Several other Senators who also oppose
I the McEnery resolution, including Sen-
I ator Piatt of Connecticut, were absent,
! and Senator Hawley's motion for a re
' consideration was made after consulta
i tion with them. There are very few in-
I stances on record In which effort has
J been made to deviate from an unani-
m ous agreement, and there is little
! doubt that Senator Mason will strenu
| ously resist this attempt.
HIGHWAYMEN ESCAPE.
Three Desperadoes Break From the

TACOMA. ; Feb. : 12.â A jail break . oc
curred at Ellensburg last night, by which
three highwaymen escaped. Charles Ray,
Arthur : Harris and Frank Thomas were
arrested last fall for highway robbery.
The Jury disagreed at their trial last
month, and they were to be re-tried. Last
night they called s. Jailer Boyd and re
quested that a fire be built inside their
steel cage. As he stepped Into the corri
dor two of them jumped upon and gagged
him using a towel with a round, piece of
wood in it. They tied his hands and feet
and all three escaped. An -hour later
Boyd got one arm loose, cut his bonds and
gave the alarm. It was found they had
sawed through eight half-inch bars, mak
ing a square hole through * which they
crawled Into the i corridor, i Before depart
ing they thrust a letter into Jailer Boyd's

CLOVERPALE, Feb. 12.â A1l prep
arations for the seventh annual citrus
fair are about completed, and it now
remains for the exhibitors to display
their genius in arranging the exhibits
for the exposition. The fruit from the
orange groves is better than hereto
fore, and the large premiums offered by
the board of directors Insure an ar
tistic display which will nrove better
than any made in former years.
Superintendent T. B. Wilson is a very
busy man these days arranging to
place the numerous displays in proper
place, and the applications for space
are coming in so fast that the large
pavilion is scarcely big enough to ac
commodate the various exhibitors.
The decorations of the pavilion will
be on a grander scale than heretofore
attempted. A San Francisco decorator
has charge of this part of the arrange
ment, and, under the supervision of the
decoration committee, is transforming
the large pavilion into a "dream" of
yellow, white and green.
. As to the exhibitors, all are striving
in good-natured but eager rivalry to
present fitting exhibits to compare with
this "fairyland," and to present them
to California's citizens ana incidentally
the judges of awards for claims
of superiority and merit. New ideas
and hence new exhibits will be features
of the fair. There will be Japanese
padogas, Indian canoes, the Eiffel
tower, the Brooklyn bridge, trie Ameri
can flag and other new creations.
The programme committee has been
hard at work. It has been decided that
J. A Filcher, secretary of the State
Board of Trade, shall give the opening
address. On Saturdayâ is Men
docino County dayâ a prominent Ukiah
citizen will speak and the Ukiah band
will give concerts both morning: and
evening.
Monday will be school children's day.
and all teachers and scholars are in
vited to attend and enjoy the free hos
pitality of the fair directors.
Tuesday will be the Cloverdale
"home" day and also the day for the
baby show. This part of the fair is un
der direct control of C. E. Humbert and
Mrs. T. Yordi, and the rivalry will be
intense. Trophies will be awarded each
for the best looking boy baby and for
the best looking girl baby.
Wednesday (Washington's Birthday)
will be Sonoma County's day, and will
witness the finale of the fair. The cele
brated Glee Club from Santa Rosa will
sing and in addition there will be prom
inent speakers and a chorus by school
children. In the evening the Cloverdale
band will give its annual citrus fair
dance, which will, as heretofore, be a
prominent feature of the amusements.
This band, under leadership of Profes
sor G. E. Bailhache, assisted by Jesse
Laskey, the composer of "The Steede
chaser" will give promenade concerts
both afternoon and every day during
the exhibition.
The wine growers and the fruit grow
ers are ably represented by a commit
tee comprising such men as â¢W. J.
Hotchiss of Wine Makers' Corporation.
A. C. Bills of Healdsburg and J. B.
Cooley, A. C. Ledger and F. Albertz of
Cloverdale. These men "> are looking
after the wine displays and exhibits of
dried fruits. 7
As heretofore there will be several
booths in the pavilion. The lunch coun
ter and ice cream booth will Be in con
trol of the Ladles of the Guild. The
candy and popcorn booth will be in
charge of Miss Maude Graham, and the
orange booth will. be taken in charge of
by Mrs. J. R. Vassar and Mac Dobbins.
There will be a fishpond for the school
children and other , attractions in addi
tion.
One attraction of the fair, as hereto
fore, will be the "press room." It ' is
here that reporters and newspaper men
will find ample accommodations to
carry on their correspondence. Desks
and tables will be provided, and any
visitor wishing to â  avail himself of the
privilege of writing to friends at home
is welcome to. share the hospitality of
the press room. 7Â«SBSS_B_K

Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONG CREEK, Or., Feb. From
persons who are posted on the condi
tion of range horses in this country
and from reports received from the va
rious adjoining counties, It is ascer
tained that stock horses are sharing
the same fate â starvation â a great
extent all over Eastern Oregon.
Cattle and sheep buyers who have
recently visited this city and who also
have been in the Counties of Cook, Gil
liam, Morrow, Baker, Union, Wallowa,
Umatilla, Harney and Malheur, say
that in every section they have visited,
with very few exceptions, the owners
of horses and cattle have despaired of
saving more than a small percentage of
their stock. In Malheur the conditions
are more favorable for the horses than
in any other county named, and even
there it is estimated that from 30 to 50
per cent will perish. In Harney, Baker,
Crook, Morrow, Umatilla and Gilliam
the horses could not be saved even if
their Value would warrant feeding them
hay, as all reports go to prove that
there is barely sufficient hay for sheep
and cattle. Both range and hay are
scarce in the greater portion of Mor
row and Grant, while in Harney and
that portion of Umatilla which adjoins
Grant, thousands of head of stock cat
tle have been driven in to winter on the
surplus hay. -
No definite estimate can possibly be
made as to the number of horses that
will perish in each county, as nine out
of ten stockmen when approached on
the subject invariably answer that they
have no idea how many they have, and
generally add that it makes little dif
ference, as they are valueless. Differ
ent persons who have traversed a por
tion of the ranges of the counties
named have said the hills were becom
ing strewn with horse carcasses, and
as the conditions are daily growiflg
worse, it may be safely estimated that
200,000 horses will die in Eastern Ore
gon before the middle of March.
Conservative stockmen, when asked
why the horses are permitted to perish,
have said that since the decline of the
noble animal the herds of sheep and
cattle have increased to such an extent
that they alone exhaust the supply of
feed, whereas when the horse com
manded a good figure the herds of cat
tle and sheep were kept proportionately
small. yy.

Dawson located claims, as did many mi
ners who had just thrown up profitable

The new stream was named Christmas
Creek. Its exact length was yet unde

at Its mouth. This time some prospectors
went several miles up stream and were

THE PRESS AND THE GOVERNOR.
/"Y MON.G his eccentrical exhibitions in one day, |
/ ,\ Governor Gage on Friday sent a message to |
. the Legislature asserting the illegality of I
claims by newspapers for the publication of the amend
ments to the State constitution submitted to the vot- j
ers at the last election and aggregating about $69,000. I
These claims are. of two classesâ those directly au- j
thorized by ex-Governor Budd, among which is in- j
eluded the demand of The Call, and those originating j
.in. publications in newspapers throughout the State, |
7. which under former precedents relied upon legislative
.justice for "compensation. ' . â¢ . â¢
.-'.-' The. propriety of giving every voter in the State a
full opportunity. read and to Study each amendment
to/the constitution upon which his vote is to be cast .
Was so obvious to the Legislature of 1883 that by the
express authority of Article XVIII, Section 1, of that
instrument; it. directed the Governor to advertise pro
posed amendments for three months before the elec
tion in at least four newspapers of general circulation
."provided no; other mode is provided by law." â¢ By
this, enactment provision was made for the intelligent
. vise of -the elective franchise in its most important;
hearing on the welfare of the State. Under this j
law,. cm Various occasions prior to the election of 1898, I
proposed amendments had been published in many j
â¢ newspapers, and their claims had invariably been set- j
tied. 'â 'â â¢'? â¢.;.-. .-.â¢â -.
â¢â¢" Under.sections ii94.and 1195 of the Political Code, '
'â¢.'as amended in 1891,.. the Clerk in each county was \
directed ten days before the election to publish in two j
newspapers the nominations for office and pending
amendments." ' These sections, while they existed in
this form, -in ho respect conflicted with, or were in
â¢ tended for, or could possibly have operated as^^sub
stitute or equivalent for the educational process de
' vised in :i 883. For section 1194, however, as it
. "existed when "this non-conflicting publication was
directed,, a complete substitute was made in 1893,
when the publication was superseded by the mailing
of sample ballots, but not amendments to the con
? stitution, to-each voter. There is nothing therefore
' in the Political Code that by any stretch of interpre
tation could be brought into even apparent conflict
with the original law. All these legislative, pro
visions were before ex-Governor Budd, who. has long
been a distinguished lawyer, practicing chiefly in. civil
cases, .when, with the written indorsement of the
then Attorney General Fitzgerald, he directed the
publications of last year, the claims based on which
have now been rejected by the Board of Examiners
and transmitted to the Legislature. The plain law
thus read as- it existed by ex-Governor Budd and ex-
Attorney General Fitzgerald is controverted by
Governor Gage in his message, but fully sustained by
his. own citations, while the only case he mentions is
ar? inapplicable as a decision by the Bunsby tribunal
or Mr. Justice Dogberry; His attempted argument
therefore is merely the fabric of a baseless guber- 1
riatorial dream. â¢
Governor Gage also wants each claim to be pre
sented to' the Legislature in a separate bill. There are
about four hundred newspapers in the State, of which
seventy-five published the proposed amendments in
1898, and at a rough guess a separate bill for the claim
of each, in actual expenses for printing and for the
usual legislative proceedings, would probably cost
half of the entire amount involved. The Governor,
therefore, who dislikes The Call and the press gener
ally for its efforts to secure the election of a qualified
Senator of the United States, not only disputes an in
controvertible'legal proposition and exposes his own
incompetency. discuss questions of statutory con
struction,-but under a false plea of economy, proposes
"to save. at the spigot and waste at the bung."
The' real animus of this message is too clear to be
misconceived:' It is apparent tliat our Chief Execu
tive runs, oh a narrow gauge and in this State all nar
row gauges terminate in the particular broad gauge
that leadeth to destruction. â¢ ,

lib**/ quartered. in this city to be removed. to the capi

do for itself, and this is to build a hotel. At present
it can hardly accommodate the Burns touts.
Several people were publicly whipped in Delaware

THE RAILROAD CANDIDATE.
THE Sacramento Record-Union, owned by the
Southern Pacific Company and its official
organ, has issued an imperial ukase to the
eighty-five Republicans in the Legislature to the ef
fect that the deadlock must be broken by an open
council, or caucus. â¢ Disobedience is to be followed
by the direst penalties. The unpublished part of the
ukase, as understood at Sacramento, is that, each day,
the candidate having the lowest number of votes is
to be dropped, until a choice is reached by forty-three
votes, or a majority of the caucus. The point of
this insolent dictation is that, by the eliminating pro
cess, the contest will be narrowed down to Daniel
M. Burns and Ulysses. S. Grant, both of whom are
obnoxious to the Republican party and to nearly all
reputable citizens in the State, and then, by the un
sparing application of the railroad screws, its parasite
and representative is to be forced into the seat, for
which he is intellectually and morally disqualified.
When driven into a corner it is the .habit of the
railroad openly to slap the people of the State in the
face. It remains to be seen whether eighty-five Re
publicans, nearly all of whom were elected in 1898
under the specific pledge that the railroad was out of
politics and that they were beyond railroad influence,
will convert themselves into the hand by which the slap
is to be administered. ' The Call and the whole inde
pendent Republican press of California has voiced the
substantially unanimous sentiment of representative
citizens against the candidacy of Dan Burns, backed
almost exclusively by the railroad, and against the
candidacy of Ulysses S. Grant, distinctly proved to
have been forwarded by money. The* Mexican as
pirant, however, is immeasurably, the worst of the two.
Had the fact not been daily paraded before the public
eye, it would have been inconceivable that, for weeks,
a defaulter to the State, a corrupt boss of an inferior
type, defeated, in 1894 and since then a municipal
center of political debauchery,. without a claim or a
qualification for official station or legislative or popu
lar recognition, should have held a Senatorial election
ie an iron grip. The brazen exhibition has already
disgraced the commonwealth and mantled the faces of
our citizens with the blush of shame.
Appeals or warnings to Dan Burns or his railroad
master are vain. They are destitute of patriotism
and they perfectly understand that the question is
i whether the State of California or the railroad shall
be represented in the Senate of the United States.
Their obstinate determination is that an independent
Democratic Senator shall be succeeded by a Repub
lican chattel. The fate of the Republican party is to
them immaterial. They are more" than willing, they
are anxious, to swallow their declarations before the
election and to prove that the Southern Pacific
Company actually owns the State. The railroad pol
icy is always broad enough to take in all parties. It is
pressed simultaneously through the most conflict
ing organizations.. Since November last it has be-,
come apparent that the deliberate intention is to
wreck the Republican party in California, and, in
1000, to turn the State over to the Democrats, or
more properly to the men who have usurped the
name of Democracy. The undercurrents of railroad
politics all point in that direction. William F. Her
rin has always been a Democrat. William H. Mills,
the turgid Mercury of the Record-Union and of two
or three subsidiary, newspapers, was an advocate of
the free silver heresy in 1896, but in 1899 assumes the
functions of a "railroad slave-driver of sound-money
Republicans. The removal of the mask from the
face' of Dan Burns, on January 2of this year, was a
confession of treachery to Republicanism and to the
people and a distinct menace to the party." The cover
ed advocacy of Dan Burns by the Examiner, , which
for six weeks has been clearly discernible, is another
revelation of railroad purposes and of railroad
methods. There are a hundred straws in the air,
each of which shows the drift of the existing storm.
It does not follow, because the railroad, ukase has
been formulated by the Record-Union, and because
the Oakland Tribune, another railroad organ, has
wheeled info line, that eighty-five Republican legis
lators will clap their hands and applaud this bare
backed act. The Call so far has failed, to perceive
any outward and visible signs of corruption or any
lack of brains or manhood in the large majority of.
Republican Senators and Assemblymen, and it can
not believe that they will falsify their pledges and dis
grace themselves and their constituencies because the
railroad whip sounds about their ears. On the con
trary, it may reasonably be expected that for once
the railroad has gone too far and assumed too much
and that it will encounter resentment instead of en
forcing submission. By its acceptance of Howard E.
Wright's resignation of the Speakership and its re
fusal to eject him from its ranks, the Assembly has
already placed itself in the attitude of holding that
the receipt of pecuniary aid from a candidate for the
Federal Senate . and pledging to him reciprocal
support, does not involve personal dishonor, whether
the pledge was or was not kept. This unwise de
cision may be barely tolerated upon the ground of
sympathy, even when extended to an unrepentant cor
ruptionist. But if it were followed by the election of
Dan Burns, whose record and whose character, as
well as the influences behind him, are universally
known and condemned, then the present Legislature
would inevitably go down to posterity and to history
with a reputation for unspeakable infamy and unpre
cedented treachery to the Republican party of the
Union.
The heroism of our California volunteers in Cuba
and in the Philippines has been braided into history in
bright and. uplifted characters. In blood and in
death they have raised themselves to the level of the
immortals and woven the eschscholtzia into the chaplet
of patriotism. But here, in their native State, foul
and mercenary politicians, bearing the railroad brand,
seek to sacrifice our interests and our honor on the
altar of rapacity. The contrast is too painful for
contemplation. No legislator can participate in this
last conspiracy and afterward, with an unpolluted
conscience, look his 'neighbors or his family in the
face. It seems improbable, though masked with
solemn plausibilities and incorrigible hypocrisy, that
it should fall to pieces in the fierce heat of right
eous indignation. There is something in every human
heart that scorns such utter prostitution. Let- Dan
Burns and Ulysses S. Grant be dropped and the dead
lock will break without a caucus. The Call repeats
that it has no candidate, but that for the sake of its
party and with special reference to the approaching
Presidential election, and still more for the sake of
the State and the nation, it once more demands
the prompt election of a Republican, a statesman and
a gentleman. â â¢"â  t â¢ 'â '.. y
THE POPULARITY OF EXPOSITIONS.
CHARLES L. PATTON, Supervisor Lackmann
and Secretary Doolan, who, as representatives
of the Pacific Exposition Committee, visited
Sacramento last week for the purpose of urging a
State appropriation for the enterprise, report the pre
vailing sentiment in the Legislature to be favorable
to the movement and the San Francisco delegation to
be a unit in favor of it. â¢.-; I .-* - ' .'â¢ â '-' '-" 'â ';'â â  '-U-\ â ---.'
It is not surprising that should be so. " Expbslr
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1899.
tions have proven so advantageous to communities
that the practical common sense of the modern world
has adopted- them as a potent means of promoting
commerce and industry. â  They are becoming one of
the salient features of our civilization and are increas
ing in popularity and in profit.
In commenting recently upon an impression which
prevailed at one time that the success of the great
Columbian Exposition at Chicago.- would discourage
further efforts in that direction in the United States
and elsewhere, the New York Tribune said: ,
"Fortunately, there is no likelihood of such a mis
fortune. On the contrary, the Chicago World's
Fair seems to have made the idea of expositions even
more popular than it wa_ before. The enterprising
people of Atlanta .organized an exposition in 1895,
which was a decided success. Then came the Ten
nessee Centennial -Exposition at 'Nashville in 1896,
and the Omaha Exposition of last year, each of which
reflected the greatest credit on those who organized
them. During the same period a number of exposi
tions were held in Europe that would have attracted
world-wide attention thirty or forty years ago.- In
every one of these expositions the latest and best
products of the world's industry and thought were
shown, and were viewed by multitudes of interested
and intelligent people: As an advertising medium
for merchants and manufacturers an exposition ranks
next to a daily paper, though even expositions them
selves could not succeed without the publicity that is
freely given to them by the daily press."
Every considerable exposition held in this country
and most of those held ;in Europe have been success
ful not only as money-making ventures, but as
schemes' of education. Such exhibitions of industry
serve as clearing houses of- the world's progress and
culture. They attract the attention of men to the
communities in which they are held and never fail to
add greatly to their prestige and industrial activity.
So widely is this truth recognized that no less than
five American cities outside of San Francisco are how
preparing for expositions within the near future.
Philadelphia intends to open one next .year. St.
Louis will attempt one, on a scale calculated to sur
pass Chicago, in 1003; and New York City, Buffalo
and Detroit are discussing* projects for which the
dates have not yet been fixed.
.In all of these expositions that of San Francisco
will.hold a unique place. It will be the only inter
national exposition ever held in the great West, the
only one devoted to a special development of the won
derful industrial and commercial possibilities' of the
Pacific Ocean. As such- it will be undoubtedly the
most attractive to be held anywhere between the
closing of the Paris exposition in 1000 and the vast
display which St. Louis proposes three years later.
LAST week was almost featureless as far as trade
was concerned. The conditions noted the pre
ceding week continued to rule, and from one
end of the country to the other it was a monotonous
story. The subsidence of speculation reduced the
volume of bank clearings materially from the enor
mous-totals of the past fortnight, but they still showed
a gain of 27 per cent over the same week last year.
The failures for the week were 217, against 295 for the
same week in 1898, hence business, as indicated by
these two barometers, was good.
Thus far there have been no evil effects from the
whirl of speculation mentioned two weeks ago. The
regular trade of the country is going on as usual.
Stocks are slightly lower, and that is about all. Dur
ing the first half of the week there was quite a de
cline in Wall street, but the closing three days-were
stronger and the tendency to rally became marked.
The extreme cold weather of the past week is hav
ing some effect on the general markets. It has in
terfered with transportation all over the West, but
has also stimulated the demand for winter goods. It
has likewise created apprehensions of damage to the
winter wheat, as the usual mantle of snow which pro
tects the plant from excessive cold was wanting in
many sections. In spite of the inclement weather,
however, trade reports from all over the country in
dicated extraordinary activity in the principal
branches and a general business much better than at
the same time last year.
The staples show nothing new. Iron continues to
boom, hides and leather are firm, wool is dull and
cotton is active and firmer, owing to heavy foreign
purchases and prospects for a smaller crop. Other
wise the foreign and domestic trade of the United
States are without especial feature? ...
It is pretty much the same here in California. Our
finances are undisturbed and business is proceeding
on satisfactory lines without excitement. The feature
of the week was the sharp advance in meats, due to
the increasing scarcity of beef, mutton and pork. The
rise in live stock has affected retail prices, and house
keepers are perturbed over the increase in their table
expenses. Butchers and provision packers predict
still higher prices, so the outlook in this respect is
not good except for the man who owns the stock, and
even he is complaining of the scarcity of feed in many
sections. Strangely enough, hay, which should go
up under these conditions, has actually been going
down for a week and the market has been depressed
for some little time. The farmer has thus far made
no complaint of dry weather, though we have had no
rain since the 16th of January, as the rainfall during
the first half of that month was heavy enough to carry
the State for thirty days. ' But while the crops are
looking fairly as a rule pasturage is deficient and most
stock men are feeding hay, which is unusual at this
time of the year.
The leading staples of the State show no particular
change. Wheat goes up and down in a mild sort of
way, and the other cereals follow suit. The fruit men
are encouraged by a slow but steady improvement
in the dried fruit market, which bids fair to com
pletely clean up before the new crop comes forward.
There has been no further advance in wine, but the
market is firm. The other staples are reported fairly
active in general, with no marked changes in quota
tions.
Speculation in stocks and bonds in the local mar
ket continues brisk. The increase in this business
during the past year is pronounced. San Francisco
now has a legitimate stock and bond market befitting
its position as the metropolis of the coast, and the
volume of transactions is a good indication of the
millions of dollars lying in our vaults ready for in
vestment whenever a chance to make money is in
sight. Whatever San Francisco lacks it certainly is
not ready money.
-Mt may be noted that days and weeks have passed
since the time set by one hopeful. lot for the election
c f Burns, and another, equally sanguine for the elec
tion of Grant. The fact is not cited with the view to
blighting the happiness of either gang, but simply as
an interesting circumstance. ?y '/

sailors were thrown in all .directions. It
was thought that the ship had struck a
sunken rock and the engines were imme
diately reversed. It was then found that
the cause of the disturbance was a great
whale which had been hit squarely in the

It was not stated- what became of the

The British cruiser Eclipse^ had a nar
row escape, from destruction recently
while lying at Bombay. The officers were
at dinner in the wardroom when an ex
plosion was felt beneath them, followed
by several slighter concussions. The
sounds were located in the shellroom of
the twelve pounder quick-firing gun. This
was at once flooded, and after pumping
out it was found that three twelve
pounder shells from the top tier had ex
ploded, the fragments being scattered all
over the room, â¢ but having done only
slight damage to the fittings or to the
other shells. The ' only explanation of
the mystery is the theory of spontaneous
explosion.
Admiral Makaroff of the Russian navy,
ln a discourse on the relative merits of
armored cruisers and protected cruisers,
favors the latter. Lord Charles Beresford
takes a contrary view and declares that
he would rather have something on the
side that would cause the shells to burst
on the outside rather than Inside the ship.
The United Service. Gazette, commenting
on these opposite, views, sides with Lord
Beresford: and says:* "We believe this
is the view held by the vast majority of
naval officers; for although all combus
tible material may in future be carefully
excluded when building warships, and the
danger of fire be thus reduced to a mini
mum, still the tremendous wrecking
power of a high explosive shell is much
too terrible to make it a desirable visitor
between the decks of a cruiser.

NEW PASTOR FOR ST. JOHN'S.
Presbyterian^ Clergyman Closer) to Guide .the
Destinies of tr^e Church.
â " " 7 UT â  > â¢ . â "-â -â . '. â  . . â "*.*" ..".""".
REV. W. A. HUTCHISON, D.D.
THE Rev. W. A. Hutchison. was unanimously extended the call as pastor of. ; '
St. John's Presbyterian Church, corner of California and Octavia streets,- at?. 'â 
a meeting of the congregation held yesterday after the regular services.. 1f .;. ;
is understood that Dr. Hutchison will accept the call. He is now on a visit
to his church ln Yellow Springs, 0., but will return at once to assume the duties,
of his new pastorate..
N Rev. Alexander N. Carson, of Trinity Presbyterian Church, acted as modera
tor of the session when it assembled to make a selection. Judge J. D. Thornton
moved that the pastorate be offered to Rev. W. A. Hutchison. The motion pro- â¢
yoked some discussion. The motion prevailed and Dr. Hutchison will, guide the
destinies of St. John's Church.
â¢ The members of the congregation have had occasion to become thoroughly
acquainted with Dr. Hutchison, as he filled their pulpit for the last four Sundays
in January. He has proven himself a good preacher, and it is confidently ex- ?
pected that the church under his charge will make rapid upward strides. 7 â /â¢
Dr. Hutchison is a man of 55 years, and has been eminently successful in his
work with young people. He has been pastor of a church in St. Paul, one in .
Jackson, 0., and is now at the head of a cultured church in Yellow Springs, but
will resign to accept the call at St. John's. He is regarded as a forceful speak- ,
er, his lectures on the Holy Land having met with the unreserved approbation
of all who have heard them.
At the morning service Rev. Dr. Carson preached a sermon on "The Model
Church and the Model Pastor," and spoke of the harmonious relations that
should at all times exist between the latter and his flock. He also paid a glow
ing tribute to Dr. Hutchison, whom he termed "my dearest personal friend in
the ministry on earth."
The. fact that St. John's is to have a permanent pastor is a pleasing one to
the congregation, as no one has been regularly installed in the charge since Rev. \
S. Itennedy sent In his resignation two years ago.
THE JANUARY
WARRANTS ARE
ALL AUDITED
They Will Be Paid
This Morning.
NO MORE INJUNCTION TIE-UPS
A BATTLE MAY RESULT OVER
FEBRUARY CLAIMS.
Merchant Creditors Will Seek to Hold
ex-Auditor Broderick Respon
sible for Illegal Payments
During His Term.
All things may not come to those who
wait in this disappointing day and gene
ration, but to some who wait long
enough, things have been known to come.
This has been verified in the case of the
school teachers of San Francisco. After
three and a half-months they will get
thirty days' pay, less 20 per cent, and the
claimant who gets his or her warrant
cashed before 10 o'clock this morning will
avoid possible trouble.
The Superior Courts open at that time
and if any legal tie-ups are to come they
can only appear after that hour.
Auditor Wells' pew in church was
empty at yesterday's service, but he sat in
his office most .all day auditing the teach
ers' January claims. Doubtless the omis
sion to attend divine worship will be writ
ten very faintly in the Book of "Records
and will fade and be forgotten in .the
light of the good. deed done instead. There
were just 1279 warrants signed and turned
over to Secretary Simpson of the Board
of Education in the afternoon. They call
ed for $78,202 15. 'The. 20 per cent holdback
amounts to $19,550 54. . â¢ . j
The offlce of the secretary of the board
will- be opened at 8 o'clock this morning
for the delivery of the audited warrants.
and - the Treasurer will pay off . at 10
o'clock. Principals of schools in sending
down for the warrants of their teachers
must have the" order signed by each In
dividual. These orders will be retained by
the secretary as receipts for the delivery
of the warrant to the messenger.
Auditor Wells, by the advice of Gen
eral-Dickinson, signed the warrants in
obedience to the order of Judge Seawell,
but with some misgivings as to the final
outcome of the action. He makes the
following statement in regard to the mat-
ter: â *> â¢â â â  - '
"After consulting with my attorney,
and owing to the demand for Immediate
action that the teachers may.be relieved,
temporarily, at least, and being in line
ai^o with Judge Seawell's intimation, I
have decided to audit and issue January
demands, relying upon the November and
December demands, upon -which I can
now act, as the restraining order has been
modified, to recoup the treasury for mon
eys illegally paid out of this year's funds.
If they should be insufficient, the balance,
which I think will be small, can be de
ducted out of February demands. â¢
. "I am glad to do this, as it will relieve
many most deserving teachers, and I hope
all difficulties between -them and' the mer
chants will be settled before February de
mands come along. I have wanted to pay
these demands, but the litigation which
has arisen, and without my consent or
previous knowledge, has developed, the
points upon which I was compelled to
seek legal advice and act upon it."
The merchants have decided not to re
strain the payment of January salaries
to-day? but will look for relief to ex-Aud
itor. Broderick. It is claimed that this
official was in error in regarding teachers'
salaries as statutory, and by this mistake
is legally responsible. They assert that
he also disregarded the one-twelfth act ln
auditing obviously illegal demands,, and
will be neld liable for such payments.
Several years - afo the mercnant cred
itors of the city lost $300,000 by this slip
shod manner of financiering, and do not
propose to submit to a second loss. They
bow to the dictum of public opinion, but
the holders of February warrants may
find them held back in litigation. ;'.-",".-,
About 300 of the Januarj* warrants have
been assigned to brokers, and the adjust
ing of these claims will delay the settle
ment of these warrants.'

, Promptly at 2 o'clock the services be
and got the Sheriffs* deed of the property,
and instead of deeding it over the same
day to me, as he had so faithfully prom
ised, he deeded it to his brother in Ohio,
whose name was William Megginson. I
was at once advised of the deed going on
record l.n the name of William Meggin
son. and employed lawyers, and before 12
o'clock that night had, through the aid
bf the telegraph "company, filed in El Do
rado County an injunction suit against
both Megginson and the Sheriff of that
county. I afterward had to abandon
that suit and bring suit In the United
States Circuit Court against William
Megginson, for he was a non-resident,
and Megginson's idea was to get the prop
erty into the hands of a so-called inno
cent purchaser and a third party, also
being a non-resident. yy' Â«
"L. S. Meggihson shortly after that time
went on the stand in the city of San Fran
cisco and swore that he was up in El
Dorado County, and finding that there
was a good mine with a judgment against
it that could be bought for about $10,000
he sent to his brother and got the money
and bought the mine.
"Megginson and one J. P. Frenna suc
ceeded in swearing me into Jail, and while
I was there the suit brought against Wil
liam Megginson in the United States Cir
cuit Court was tried, and there, through
the testimony of L. S. Megginson, I lost
the case. I then appealed to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals, and there
it was found that the case in the United
States Circuit Court had not been prop
erly tried. The decision of the higher
court gave me a part of the property, but
by this time it had cost me more than its
value."
Turner says that as he understands that
E. S. Plllsbury will be looking for Meg
ginson to serve papers he is going to have
him arrested on four charges of per
jury, and then he will be where Mr. Pills
bury can reach him at any time.

touched first upon I the rare quality and
genius of the productions of Kipling's pen.
He said they went beneath the realistic and
unearthed the idealistic, not only expos

â¢in ideal truth. Kipling he classed with
Shakespeare, excluding an atmosphere of
the predicter, but airing his works with
the genius of real Interpretation.

gan. From the pulpit Father O'Ryan of*|
the Cathedral parish opened the exercises*
the Cathedral parish opened the exercises j
o'""* day with the recital of a prayer, I
which was followed orally after his die-*?
tation by the mem of the League, j 4
immediately after the preliminaryi
psalms and prayers. Father CrÃyan, who T
acted as the superintendent of the entire
service, delivered an eloquent address on
the purpose of the renewal of pledges,
emphasizing the necessity of shunning the
habitual use of liquor in order to preserve
the true manhood of the country. â
"To-day," he said, "we assemble here
for a great and at the same time most es
sential purpose. We come here to pledge
ourselves to that great virtue of temper
ance. We come to stand before God's
altar and in fact before God himself to
take with uplifted hand the vow of tem
perance. -.'..
--"As I look before me and view the hun
dreds of young men and boys who have
come here to perpetuate their pledges of
temperance It is with a feeling of the ut
most appreciation. Members of the
league, you are now in that period of life
where you are to form your patterns for
good or evil. By drinking, that Is. by ha
bitual drinking, you sink below the level
of true manhood, and you bring upon
yourselves eternal misery and punish
ment. Your country, which is next to God,
demands that you be men true men.
"In this country," he continued, "it is
essential that we have true men. Man
hood governs all things. By your own
efforts and the efforts of your church
and country It should be and is possible
to attain the highest and truest ideal of
manhood. The three great curses that
have wrecked the brightest and noblest
manhood in the past are dishonesty in
private and public life, immorality and
Intemperance. This habit of intemper
ance is undeniably and unquestionably a
disease. Drink is a poison to the intel
lect and the ruination of the physical
man. It is specially a poison to the
moral man. The fine edge of conscience
is ruined by drunkenness. The highest
interests of State and church demand the
abolition of this curse.

EXTORTIONISTS CAUGHT.
ONLY two of the three men arrested by Detectives Edward Gibson, T. B.
Gibson, Dinan and Wren, are suspected of having extorted $100 from Gus

Harry Williams alias George Mason, alias Francis Jerningham and Clay
Markell. J. C. Miller, the third man, is known as a bunko steerer and nothing
else is known against him yet. He happened to be with Williams when he was
arrested. The detectives are certain that Williams and Markell are two of the '
blackmailers, and that "Kid" Young, a notorious pickpocket and : flimflammer,
was the third. Young was arrested on the night of the election for*picking the
pocket of P. J- Thomas, but he was discharged by Judge Conlan. The case was
taken before the Grand Jury and Young, learning of the fact, left the city.
It will be remembered that the safe at the Old Louvre was robbed of some
valuable papers, Including certificates for mining shares and a promissory note
for $6000. A few days later Schwarz received a telephone message informing
him that the papers would be returned on the. payment of $500. He declined to
give so much and finally $100 was agreed upon. An arrangement was made for |
Schwarz to meet the men at the ferry on the afternoon of January 8, for the
exchange. Schwarz had notified the police when he got the first message, and
he was to communicate with them when he arranged to meet the men. He did
not do so, but went to the ferry alone. When he got there he was quietly ap
proached by the three men and one of them displayed a revolver.. Schwars
handed over the $100 and got in return the stolen papers.
He notified the police later and since then the detectives had been looking '
for the men. They ascertained that before Schwarz started for the ferry "Kid"
Young was in the Old Louvre watching to see that he did not communicate with
the police. .Young got on the same car with Schwarz and rode to the . ferry,
where he joined Williams and Markell. Williams was the one who flashed the
revolver. Schwarz was out of the city yesterday and was unable to call at
the prison to identify Williams and Markell, but he will be asked to do so this
morning. Whether he will do so or not Is a question, as he was warned by the
blackmailers that if they were arrested and he identified them, he would be killed.
The police have, however, another man, who saw the whole transaction at thy
ferry, and will be able to identify the men. *VV *
Williams is considered* by the police a desperate character. Under the name
of George Mason he was sentenced on April 26, 1897, to six months in the House
of Correction for petty larceny, and three months for carrying a concealed
weapon. December 23, the same year, Francis Jerningham, he .was sen
tenced to one year, for burglary and having burglars' tools in his possession.
Markell' was an associate of "Kid" Young In his flimflamming operations. He
was arrested twice, but managed to "beat" the cases. His wife has a lodging
house at 112 Fourth street. " 7
Williams has been living with a girl from Oakland, at Mason and O'Farrell
streets. When the detectives searched his room they found a silver backcomb,
two gold buckles and an umbrella, which he presented to the girl/and which were
stolen from the room of Mrs. C. Hill, in the Palmerlee Hotel, Ellis 7 street, on
January 21. For this he will be charged with burglary, and Markell ls suspected
of having been with him in the job. They are also supposed to be the two men
who.broke into the house of Sam Bernard, 526 Oak street, early last Monday
morning, and were fired at by two-students who lived there and were awakened
by the noise. Several burglaries 'In 7 the Western Addition are also attributed to
them, besides a cumber of those committed la Oakland recently. *y
"In taking this pledge do so with sin
cerity and fervency. Let no boy break it,
or forget that he has sworn to Almighty
God to abstain from liquor, and let him
abide by the vow. The boy that would
forget his pledge. If such a thing were
possible, or prostitute his faith by not
keeping it. will never amount to anything.
If you take the pledge, treasure it; see
that you do not play fast and loose with
it. You might deceive your officers, but
you cannot deceive your God."
Immediately after the sermon the pledge
was administered by the Archbishop. The
substance and the various conditions in
volved ln It are as follows:
"I declare before Almighty God, and
you, Most Reverend Father, and in the
presence of this congregation, that I
hereby solemnly renew for the following
year the promise of temperance according
to the rules of that branch of the League
of the Cross of which I am a member,
and may God -rive me the grace to keep
this, my pledge, in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen." ~-<7 :.y, yy yy
Just previous to the administration of
the pledge the Arichbishop delivered a
short address appropriate to the occasion
and in encouragement of the principles
which those who take the vow are sup
posed to adhere to and if possible further.
Upon the conclusion of the remarks the
services were concluded with solemn ben
ediction by the Archbishop, assisted by
Father Mulligan as deacon, and Father
Connolly of St. Paul's church, as sub
deacon.

The Opium Placed in Envelopes
Which Were to Be Taken to San
Quentin â Buse of
Criminals.
Policemen McGrayan and Tracey, of the
Southern Station, made an important cap
ture early yesterday morning. They vis
ited a lodging house at 48 Fourth street,
in search of a criminal, and on entering
the room supposed to be occupied by him,
they discovered two men in the act of
placing opium in numerous envelopes. The
officers at once recognized them as John
I Grant and Charles Clam, ex-convicts and
all-around crooks. "
When asked what they intended to do
with the opium the men said that they
were to pass it to their friends in San
Quentin. Each envelope contained about
$1 worth of the drug, and was addressed
to the convict for whom it was intended.
They admitted that they were to go to
San Quentin to-day and "plant" the
opium. It was to be .ug up by one of the
outside trusties who was friendly with
the gang and by him carried into the pris
on. Their object in placing the drug in
envelopes was to deceive the guards into
believing that the trusty had been given
some letters to deliver in case their sus
picions were aroused.
Grant is a noted, bicycle thief. For a
long time he "worked" the southern por
tion of the State, stealing valuable wheels
and selling them â¢ for whatever he could
get. He was finally arrested ln Los An
geles and sent to San Quentin for five
years. He was released on January 19,
after having served about four years.
Clam is known as a desperate burglar.
He was caught breaking into a house in
Napa and sent to San Quentin for ten
years. He was discharged only a few
days ago. Both men were warm friends
while in the penitentiary. It is supposed
that after their release they conceived the
bold scheme of supplying the "fiends" of
San Quentin with opium by placing the
drug ln envelopes and then have them
carried into the prison. *
Grant and Clam were booked for va
grancy, but it is likely that more serious
charges will be placed against them to
day, as it is believed that they are respon
sible for several recent hold-ups.

Second Regatta of Oakland Navy De-
clared No Race.
The second Oakland navy regatta of
the season of 1899, which should have
taken place yesterday afternoon over the
triangular six-mile course on the San An
tonio estuary, was begun but did not
reach a conclusion. The canoe Whim
crossed the starting-line off the house of
the Alameda Boat Club at 1:20 p. m., and
was followed by the sloop Flash, the sloop
Beatrice, the half-rater Minette, the ca
noe Gnat, and the sloop Ahwahnee, in the
order in which they are here named.
The course, which Is about six and a
half miles long, must be covered within
a time limit of two hours. The breeze,
which had been -moderate at starting,
gradually fell until it became evident that
none of the boats would get around the
course within the allotted time. The race
was accordingly declared off, and will be
sailed at some future date, probably on
Sunday, February 25. Commodore Philip
Caduc was out on the creek in his sloop
Zephyr, but did not enter the race.
The regatta committee of the Oakland
Canoe Club is preparing a programme for
the coming season, in which provision will
be made for several races between craft
belonging to members, and for regattas
open to the boats of other clubs.

"For several years I suffered with
various diseases peculiar to my sex.
Was troubled with a burning sensation
across the small of my back, that all-
gone feeling, was despondent, fretful
and discouraged; the least exertion
tired me. I tried several doctors but
received little benefit. At last I de-
cided to give your Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound a trial. The ef-
fect of the first bottle was magical.
Those symptoms of weakness that I
was afflicted with, vanished like vapor
before the sun. I cannot speak too
highly of your valuable remedy. It is
truly a boon to woman."

"Before I began taking your medicine
I had suffered for two years with that
tired feeling, headache, backache, no ap-
petite, and a run-down condition of the
system, I could not walk across the
room. I have taken four bottles of the

the solicitude with which "Old Abe"

Mechanics and kindred organizations.
To-day memorial exercises will be held
in all the public schools of San Francisco,

from Grand Army posts and others.
Dr. Mackenzie's Tribute to Lincoln.
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie delivered an elo
quent panegyric on Abraham Lincoln
last evening in the First Presbyterian
Church, on the corner of Van Ness
avenue and Sacramento street. The
subject of his discourse was "The Nine
tieth Anniversary of the Birth of the
Martyr President." After showing how,
from humble beginnings, Lincoln had de
veloped into the greatest man of his cen
tury, the learned preacher said:
"Lincoln- was never ashamed of his
lowly origin. On the contrary, he gloried
in It and said that in this country it was
no handicap to any honest man. He
sought to work out his manhood by self
effort and how well he succeeded is a
matter of history. There have been three
crises in the life of our nation, but we
have been wonderfully favored in the kind
of men sent to grapple with them. The
first crisis was in the foundation of the
republic and God sent Washington. Next,
for the purification, unification and per
petuation of the republic God sent Lin
coln, and in the last crisis God has given
us McKinley."
"Lincoln was the typical man of our
continent. The hearts of twenty million
human beings throbbed in his pulses, and
the groans and cries of millions of slaves
were sounded in the depths of his great
heart. He found himself standing alone
for God and the right and he swore to
live and to die for it. The shadow of a
great tragedy was upon his soul and he
knew what it was to nurse that shadow
in unbroken lowliness of spirit.
"The hour and the man came together.
The storm burst and became. a veritable
whirlwind that threatened to engulf the
whole nation. It needed a man to guide
the storm, and Lincoln felt that he was
sent to that guidance Inspired by his gen
uine \ love for American liberty. Ques
tions of constitution, of legal right, of
free trade and protection arose, but the
atmosphere that surrounded them all was
the atmosphere of slavery. He was bit

. Lincoln Is Dr. Locke's Theme. ... I
' At the Central M. E. Church last even- 1
ing Dr. Charles Edward Locke took fori
his subject, "The Superb Christian Char-T
acter of Abraham Lincoln." He said in*
part: a
"The 12th day of February, 1809, is most X
significant in the calendar of this country.
It is remarkable as being ttie birthday of
a group of men most influential in the
great achievements of the last fifty years.
It gave to poetry Edgar Allen Poe, Oliver
Wendell Holmes*and Alfred Tennyson; to
music, Chopin and gentle Mendelssohn;
to science, Charles Darwin; to England
and Europe, William Ewart Gladstone. It
was the birthday of Samuel F. Smith, the
author of "My Country, "Tis of Thee."
and of Ray Palmer, who is immortalized
in "My Faith Looks Tip to Thee." But to
us that 12th day of February was most
memorable because it gave to America
and the world that superb Christian and
patriot, Abraham Lincoln.
"I hold up to you the character of Lin
coln as an Ideal which not only deserves
to be memorialized in granite block, but
is worthy of the study and imitation of
the most ambitious seeker after the high
est levels attainable to the earnest and
devout Christian. The life and achieve
ments of Abraham Lincoln are a complete
vindication of the teachings and promises
of Jesus Christ. He was a man of integ
rityâabsolutely honest and honorable.
There is not a suspicion of stain upon his
character. He was humble. Born in
poverty and trained in adversity, his life
was a struggle. He had never means or
leisure enough to give him aristocratic
tendencies. He was always a plain man
of abstemious habits. He was the peo
ple's friend; he forgave his enemies and
made them his friends.
Oliver C. Miller's Address.
Oliver C. Miller delivered an address in
connection with the Lincoln memorial
exercises in the chapel of the Crocker Old
People's Home. He said Christ was the
great liberator of men and that Lincoln.
Washington, Paul and the great army of
heroes and martyrs were the instruments
of his power. Among other things he
said: "They are inseparably united as
men whom the truth loved, and upon
whose brows the Goddess of Liberty loved
to place her crown. ... .
"Lincoln, though surrounded by doubt
ers, never lost the courage of his con
victions that a just God was able to take
care of a just cause. He was deaf to the
faltering crowd that clamored about him,
and of all his virtues his courage was the
most sublime." â

Prior to the race there will be short- dis
tance amateur and professional events,
the same as last night. The men will ride
exactly 142 hours, taking such rest as
they deem necessary. How little tney
need of this can be judged from the fact
that in the recent race in New York the
winner. Champion Miller, slept but fif

after the start, and several have declared
they will not dismount until they hold the

Demands of Patriotism.
It was "patriotic night" last evening at |
the Howard street Methodist Church, and
in addition to a stirring address from the
pastor, Dr. J. A. B. Wilson, there were
Lincoln memorial exercises by the Order
of Junior American Mechanics and
Daughters of Liberty. The altar and pul
pit were draped with two large American
Hags.
Dr. Wilson spoke on the "Demands of
Patriotism." taking for his text the vie- I
torious wars of Joab, the noted Israelite
chief, with his army of native-born war
riors, against the mixed foreign troops of
Syria. When hosts of the enemy men
aced the men of Joab he said, "Be of good
courage and let us play the man for our
people and for the cities of our God.
"The principles which actuated Joab are
the sam. that should be impressed on the
patriotic orders and the patriotic men of
this country," continued the speaker.
"Note that patriotism has a claim para
mount to personal considerations. When
that principle dies, all dies.
"The spirit that moved a handful of
Americans long ago to pledge their lives,
liberty and sacred honor for country is
being displaced by those leaders who are
asking 'what is in it' for them. In place
of the old State House at Philadelphia we
see the Capitol at Sacramento, with its
daily scenes of bribery and corruption.
Across the continent in Washington we
see the same shameful practices. The
country, run by the little men, the bad
men, is going the wrong way, and its fu
ture will be closed in darkness unless pa
triotism awakes to greater activity. More
of such men whose births is observed this
evening are wanted. More Lincolns, more
honest sons of toil and love of country, to
bear back the American institutions from
ruin. When bad men conspire good men
must combine. In conclusion learn that
the citizenship of our native land must be
rallied to the defense of our country's
honor and to the preservation of her in
stitutions."

has been riding horses in training here, and
in the East for several months past, and
is ambitious to become a jockey. He has
received many valuable tips from Tod

CONTEST OVER
THE FORTUNE
OF A PIONEER
Young Widow Must
Defend Her Rights*
UNDUE INFLUENCE EXERCISED
SO CLAIMED BY RELATIVES OF
AARON SHAVER, â¢
Nephews and Nieces Assert That the
Old Capitalist Was Not in His
Righ,t Mind When He
Married.
Mrs. Annie Shaver, widow of Aaron
Shaver, late capitalist of San Rafael, will
make her home in San Francisco for some
time to come. The family residence across
the bay will be temporarily closed, and
the gossips of Marion County's capital
will be able to give free rein to their
tongues. Things have been said and done
during the past week or so, however, that
are likely to end in bitter personal suits
before the difficulties are over.
In the meantime the contest over the
money left by the dead capitalist will be
gin to-day, and the indications are that
the legal battle will be a bitter one. The
contestants assert that Aaron Shaver was
not in his right mind when he was mar
ried nearly five years ago, and that his
will made two years ago was drawn un
der the influence of the widow, the dead
man's brother "Jake" and James Tun
sted, the real estate agent of San Rafael.
The property involved is considerable.
Two-thirds of it was left to the widow
and one-third to the brother, while the
remaining relatives were Ignored.
The contestants of the will are Jane
Haddeman and Charles Shaver, who as
sert they are half-sister and half-brother
respectively of the deceased. This con
tention Is strenuously denied by "Jake"
Shaver, who says he will bring proof from
the East that neither one has any legal
title to the claim they make. Joined with
Mrs. Haddeman and Charles Shaver in
the suit are Minnie. Etta, Joy, Glen and
Royal Shaver and Clara Lovejoy, of this
city, sons and daughters of the late Isaac
Shaver, who owned and operated the saw
mill and lumber yards at West End, San
Rafael, for years before his death.
Although worth over $150,000, the world
did not seem to go well with Isaac Shaver
in other respects, and one morning about
six years ago he drowned himself ln the
bay. His family still lives in San Rafael,
but the fortune left by the father has
dwindled considerably.
The other members of the Shaver fam
ily were all born on a farm near Con
stantine, Mich., and "Jake" still retains
his interest In the old homestead. Early
in the '50s, Isaac, Aaron and Jacob made
up their minds to come to California. It
took them six months to cross the plains,
and Isaac and Aaron nearly died on the
way.
"When we were a month on the road,"
said Jacob yesterday, "Isaac and Aaron
were taken sick with the measles. We
had a cook and a driver with us and while
they attended to the outfit and pushed
along I nursed my brothers. It was a
terrible, trying time, but Aaron soon
pulled through and helped me with Isaac.
At times we thought we would never get
Isaac to California. When he got better
from the measles he was taken sick with
dysentery, and It was only when we got
to the sink of the Humboldt that he be
gan to recover. The water we were com
pelled to drink was slippery with alkali,
and that was what nearly killed him.
"When we finally got to California we
settled in El Dorado County. Isaac
opened a store and Aaron did the team
ing, while I helped along. That was over
forty years ago, and Aaron was a regu-

lar giant In those days. He did not know
what it was to be tired, and he would get
his team through with a load when dozens
of others, would fall. We all did well in
El Dorado, and when the excitement was
over we came to San Francisco and finally
located in San Rafael. â¢
"When Aaron and Isaac and I left
Michigan my brother Frederick remained
behind on .the farm with father. When
the old gentleman died the farm and
everything was left to the four of us.
Aaron and Isaac sold their interest to
Fred, but I kept mine, so that the place
could not be sold to strangers. â¢ I told
Frederick to use my share, as it would
help to bring up his ) family, and he aid
so. When my father died Charley and
Jane got . nothing, and if they ; had no
claim on the old gentleman's estate I
can't for the life of me see where they
come in for a share of Aaron's.
"Now, as to Aaron being insane, that,
is all nonsense. He was saner than any
one of the contestants, and transacted
business right up to the day he was taken
sick. -And as to his marriage. Now, just
let me tell you this. Aaron may have been
a hard man .where money was concerned,
but never forget that ! he had to toll and
slave to make it, and he loved his wife.
I myself took her picture out of a
pocket in his shirt next his heart after
his death. 7 A better wife a man never had.
She is young : enough to have been his
daughter, but for the five years she was
his wife he knew what the comforts of
home something he. had not known
for over forty years. yy. 7 â ,_
"They were married in June, 1894, by
Justice of the ; Peace Gardiner, in San
Rafael, i and Aaron gave Gardiner : a 520 1

cxJsitnce of war. the use Of experienced
m'eji merely- on account" of their, age. We
th-gk y wb.u'd. ' _â _ Wise to make, it d'scre

â¢ During the recent > law . many positions
were, filled . by the .appointment of civil-'
ians".- to?. which .-retirea- officers could have
brought- professional- training. Valuable
knowledge 'and, Targe experience. '.'â 
In the matter of the regimental otÃi
â¢ce'r.j the. commission found that ail
vul.un-te.er. .commands officered by. men
of- military experience apd training:
fared much bet than those officered j
by; amateurs. The I soldiers were morel
'effectively- cared for,- enjoyed, better j,
health. arid were better fed and clothed. â 
The? commission recommends, for the
; future, a .strict ' examination " into . the
qualification- of a.U officers appointed
to "the army, regular or volunteer. The ;
establishment: of . schools of Instruction \
for inexperienced officers? taken â¢ from j
civil/life to meet the emergency create
ed by the war is highly commended.
'-'Quite-' a number of regular ..officers, as
signed to the command of volunteer
troops adopted this- expedient and the
results were eminently satisfactory. A
. most important criticism by the' com
mission is as follows: ,
The routine work in the. departments.
" In 'our opinion?. Is far beyond what is .nec
essary and each year seems to 'increase
ii The methods employed make It air
most Impossible -to transact business
"promptly. The heads of ail departments,
officers of large depots? chiefs of staff, de
partments, corps and divisions have nee
. essarlly been obliged; to give the time and
.attention to details, which should have
been given to matter- of. larger moment.
No Wei J regulated â¢ concern or corporation
could transact business satisfactorily un
der such, regulations as govern the staff
departments, and "the .fact that every of
: Tficer of each -of,- the .'staff." departments
â¢ Holding â  responsible. â¢ positions has. been
obliged to .-.routine demonstrates the
necessity of? a thorough reform. ' -
The report now proceeds to take up
the subjects in their regular order, be
ginning -with' the army. On the first

A recommendation looking to the fu
ture then follows:.
One of the lessons taught by the wax Is
that the country should hereafter, in a
better state of preparation for war. Sug-.
gestions have been made that large sup
plies of all the material not liable to de
terioration should be kept on hand to.be
continuously issued and renewed, so that
in any emergency hey might be avail
able. Especially should this be. the case
with supplies which cannot be rapidly ob
tained in open market. .. ' ? ;.?
Perhaps the most significant utter
ance in the whole document, so far as
concerns the discipline of the . army,
times next. ' '.â¢
For many years the Clvlded authority
and responsibility in the War Department
has produced friction, for which, In the
Interest of the service, a remedy, If pos
sible, should be applied. The constitution
makes the President the commander-ln- â¢
chief of 'the army, and he cannot transfer
that authority to any other person. The j

general is assigned to duty as such by
â¢ the President, and under the military
' laws of the United States his duties are
; defined as follows: _:'_'"*â ''__
"The command exercised by th. com
manding general of the army, not hay-
I ing be^n made the subject of statutory
regulation, is determined by the order of
â¢ assignment. It has been habitually com
' posed- of the aggregate of the several ter
. ritorial commands that have been or may
' be created by the President.
â¢ "The military establishment is Under or
ders. from the commanding general of the
: army in that which pertains to its disci
pline and military control. The fiscal af
fairs of the. army are conducted by the
Secretary .of War, through the several
staff departments;'' (Par. 17, A. R., 1895.)
"Ail orders and instructions from the
President or -Secretary of War relating
to military operations or affecting the
." military, control and discipline of the
army will be promulgated through the

1895.)
I " Lleutenant-General Schofleld. who has
probably had as much experience and
given the question as much thought and
study as any one ln our country, says, in
substance: .;
' Recent- experience hag served to confirm all
the -results of my : lifelong study and large
experience that the proper position for the
senior officer of the army on duty atÂ» Wash
ington Is not that of commanding general.- a
position which- is practically Impossible, but
1 that of general-lnrchlef, which means,, in fact,
, chief of- staff to the. President. The title of
. general-ln-chief â¢ was â¢: a permanent one during
the entire history of ' the country' up to the
time when General Grant became lieutenant-'
- general. 'â¢ '".. â 
AA'hen- I became the commanding . general, I
addressed to the President a- letter in which I
pointed- out. to him' what, had been the result, of
' my study and experience, and saying that the
only way was to abandon entirely, which I did
' during my seven years of service, all pretense
{ of. being the. commanding general, and to con
tent myself with acting as the chief of staff
of the army under the Secretary of War and
the President. The result was that perfect har
mony prevailed during my time, and I did not
â¢ exercise a legitimate influence in command of
â¢ the army, this because I did not claim to exer
cise anything which the law did not give me.
. â¢ .The President must have the same power of
selection of his general-ln-chlef as he has of
his Secretary of War; without this there can be
; no.' guarantee ' that he will give, or that the
I Secretary of War will place ln the general-Jn-
I chief, .that- confidence which Is necessary to
i perfect harmr'ny. Neither the Presllent nor the
. - Secretary, of. War should .have In the command
I of the army an "officer who is not working in
harmony -with. him. '..
The report now takes up the War
i Department and its various chiefs of
I subdlAisions. beginning with the Sec
retary of War. - â¢ --yy-
-The. records of the AVar Department,
-which have been laid before us, show that
the Secretary of .War extended to all
chiefs of bureaus cordial. and full support
! and promptly: responded to even* proper
â  demand made upon him by commanding
! officers. No testimony has been presented
| showing Intentional neglect of duty nor
: any : attempt to serve personal interests.
: The charges made that the Seceretary of
, War was privately interested in the con
?tracts, purchases and other transactions
: of the War Department have been thor
; oughly examined and found baseless.
| In the judgment of the commission there
I was lacking in the general administration
I of the War Deparment during the contin-
I uance of "war with Spain that com
plete grasp of the situation which was es
sential. to the highest efficiency and disci
pline of the- army. . .
The commission has refrained from crit
icizing certain of the heads of bureaus
for not having acted. with foresight in
preparing their various departments for
i active, war. before war was acutally de-
I elated, because It has appeared that the
national defense fund provided by the
| act of March 9, 1898, was not made avail
! able for use except for the navy and for
coast defenses and the expenditures
: incident thereto until after the declara-
I tion of war.
. The report eulogizes the work of the
adjutant general, commissary, general
and -criticizes the deficient work of the
inspector general for the failure of a
proper inspection of camps. The most
significant part of the report in ref
erence to the bad work of the quarter
master general's department is as fol
lows: - -yy â â .-; :'- -y --,
Land transportation of the command
during the Santiago campaignâ Owing, to
lack of necessary transport the means of
-land transportation during the Santiago
campaign was painfully deficient. General
Shatter testified that he could carry no
more on his transports from Tampa; that
he realized that he would have very few
ambulances, but that wagons could be
used for transportation, both of the
wounded, and of supplies, while ambu
lances could be employed only for one
purpose. General Humphrey, testified that
no more land transportation was taken,
simply because the vessels were fully
loaded.
The testimony shows that the trans
ports arrived off the south coast of Cuba
near Santiago on June 21; that the pack
trains were landed on June 22; that the
first wagons were landed on June 25, and
that the landing of the latter was con
tinued more rapidly than they could be
set up on shore and that, in fact, some
of those that were landed were never set
up at all. - ;_.--,.Â».â 
General Chaffee testifies that on July 1,
at the battle of El. Caney, ten days after
the arrival of the fleet, there were no am
bulances or wagons available and that
the roads were so horrible that they could
not reach the front.
It is plainly evident that this army of
17,000 men disembarked in the face of an
enemy, in a hostile country and rapidly
thrown forward against a well armed
force, was painfully deficient in land
transportation, but ln spite of the ab
sence of this almost absolutely necessary
portion bf the equipment of a well-trained
command, It drove the enemy before it,
capturing their outposts, pushed them be
hind their main defenses, drove their fleet
from Santiago bay to absolute destruc
tion as It faced the navy of our country,
and, finally, after gallant fighting under
a tropical sun, amidst most adverse con
ditions, captured a strongly fortified city
and received as prisoners of war over
23,000- Spanish soldiers.
â¢ Subsistence â¢ Department â Brigadier-
General- Charles P. Eagan, Commissary-
General, V.. S. A., in charge: The com
mission has carefully investigated the
subject of the condition, quality and
quantity of food supplied to the army. Al
most without exception It has been shown
by the testimony taken that wherever the
troops were ordered, whether to the var
ious camps In' the United States or to
Porto Rico. Cuba or Manila, the rations
prescribed by' law we're on the transports
and at the camps with the soldiers.
So far as we have been able to ascertain
there was but one occasion, that of a
day in front of Santiago, when the troops
were- seriously short of rations. These
had been supplied but thrown aside when
the men -went into action. The condition
of the roads and lack of transportation
prevented prompt reissue. At times Lie
vegetable ration was not of good quality,
the potatoes and onions being spoiled.
Condemned by a board of survey, such
vegetables were destroyed and an equiva
lent part of the ration issued.. Some trou
ble occurred because such vegetables and
other damaged food were disposed of by

was necessary to be done.
Refrigerated Beefâ This commission
was organized on the 24th day of
â  September- last. Up to the 21st day of
I December its members had taken testi
| mony ln seventeen different towns and
cities and nine camps. It had also
| received many hundred letters, communi
cations and newspaper clippings from
persons living In all parts of the country.
: Examination of numerous officers and en
listed men had been made as to the qual
ity and condition of the meat Issued to
â â  the troops. The testimony, with some ex
: ceptions, showed that the refrigerated
I beef Issued was pure,, sound and whole
. some.
On the 21st day of December last Major
General Nelson A. Miles, upon the writ
ten request of the president of this com
: mission, appeared before it. He refused to
be sworn, as all other witnesses had been,
except one, who affirmed, stating that he
would make his statements without being
; sworn and was repsonsible for what he
said. He proceeded, and. for the first time
in the history of this Investigation, the
allegation was made that refrigerated
beef issued to the troops had been chemi
j cally treated. In this statement, revised
| by himself, General Miles said:
"There was sent to Porto Rico 337 tons
of what is known as so-called refrigerated
beef, which I might call embalmed beef."
He proceeded to read a communication
from Dr. W. H. Daly, major and chief
surgeon, United States Volunteers, on his
staff, bearing date of September 21, 1898,
| wherein Dr. Daly stated that: "In the
i several inspections I made In the various
j camps and troopships at Tampa, Jack
i sonville, Chickamauga and Porto Rico, I
! found the fresh beef to be apparently pre-
I served with secret chemicals which de
; stroyed its natural flavor and which I
also believed to be detrimental to the
health of the troops."
Although Dr. Daly swears that he in
! formed General Miles about the first of
j August. 1898, that he suspected that the
refrigerated beef was chemically treated,
It does not appear that the general in
: formed you or the War Department
I that an officer of his staff had made this
; discovery, nor does it appear that he at
j the time ordered any of the officers under
his command to probe to the bottom an
I allegation, which, if true, concerned the
I health of 275,000 soldiers in the army. It
appears from the report of Dr. Daly,
> which he handed to General Miles October
i2l Inst that- he then specifically stated
that the refrigerated beef furnished to
the troops was "apparently chemically
treated." It does not appear when this
charge was made, October 21, it having
been already made to him in August, 1898,
that General Miles communicated to you
or the Secretary of AVar or to the commis
sary general the belief or suspicion enter
tained by him that refrigerated meat,
dangerous to health, was issued every
day to the troops, in failure to do which
there was dereliction of duty. It Is true
that on September 20 he had directed
that an order should be issued asking for
reports relating to meats issued, but the
order specifically mentions "canned fresh
roast beef" and nothing else, and It was
the reports received in answer to this that
were printed in abstract by the general at
the time of his appearance before the
commission and since. .
In his report Dr. Daly does not make
the all-important statement that he had
already chemically analyzed any meat, al
though he suggested that an analysis
should be made. He does state that in
the several inspections made by him at
Tampa. Jacksonville, Chickamauga and
Porto Rico, he "found the fresh beef to
be apparently preserved with secret
chemicals." He said that at Ponce the
beef he examined "was also of the same
character, being apparently preserved
by injected chemicals." The result of an
analysis has been reported to us and it
will be seen by the reports appended that
in no specimen examined has either
boracic or salicylic acid or other deleteri
ous chemicals been found. In view of
the facts above set. forth the commission
is of the opinion that no refrigerated beef
furnished by ' contractors and -issued 'to
the troops during the war with Spain, was
subjected to or treated* with. any f chemi
cals by the contractors or those in their
employ. questions concerning
In considering questions concerning
canned meats it is not the duty of . the
commission to inquire into .the character
and kind. For months, as it appears, Dr*
Daly concealed the commission of a crime
affecting men under his charge, whom, as
an officer and a physician, he was bound
to protect.
The report, then after quoting from
the regulations of the Agricultural De
partment prescribing the manner in
which Inspections are made (and no
packing house in the country is al
lowed to do business without Govern
mental inspection) after detailing the
processes pursued .by our officials and
showing the practical impossibility of
putting Impure meat upon the market,
goes on to say: â¢ Yy :/..
The commission has not confined itself
to merely verbal or written proof. Im
mediately upon hearing the testimony of
Dr Daly, on the 20th of January, tele
crams were sent to all Issuing commis
saries in Cuba, Porto Rico and at the
various home camps occupied by troops,
asking that samples of refrigerated beef
be at once taken, placed in glass jars
securely sealed and forwarded to the com
mission. These samples were to be of one
pound weight from the outside and one
pound weight from the inside of a quar
ter In response to this request many
samples have been received and later sent
to the chemist of the Agricultural and
Interior. Departments for careful chemi
cal examination. ;**?'-<;--
Our specific duty is to give an opinion
as to the quality of meats furnished tho
soldiers during the recent war with Spain.
There has been neither allegation nor
proof before us that boracic or salicylic or
any other acids have been used ln the
canned meats furnished to the troops, but
such meats bave nevertheless been great
ly criticized and they have for that rea
son been tested by us and have been ana
lyzed under our direction, and we, have
taken a great deal of testimony as to the
mode of their preparation. The canned
meat is ordinarily taken from the fore
quarters of beeves.
The Agricultural Department's official
reports upon the.'ihethods employed by
the packing ho*.. tea, as required under the
inspection rjgulations, is incorporated.
The unan,'.-/i6us report shows that a num
ber of officers testified that canned beef
was unpalatable. It, is also elicited that
In a tropical country/where it Is subjected
to intense heat, the meat presents a re
pulsive appearance at first. Furthermore,
it transpires that occasionally an inferior
article is found. But the records of the
army prove that canned beef has been
used for many years.
The work of the signal corps is highly
commended, as is also that of the pay
department, the engineers' - department
and corps of engineers and the ord
nance department. â  â¢

OLD MAN HELD
UP IN FRONT
OF HIS HOME
W. H. H. Thompson
Robbed by Thugs. â¢
THEY RELIEVE HIM OF $11
CRIME COMMITTED UNDER AN
ELECTRIC LIGHT.
Victim of the Desperadoes Declares
He Can Positively Identify the
Chief of His Assailants if
Captured.
OAKLAND, Feb. 12.-W. H. H. Thomp
son was held up shortly before midnight
last night within ten feet of his home
and a few feet from the patrol box from
which the police on the beat report on and
off duty and in the broad glare of an
electric light. The footpads relieved him
of $11. y y\
The robbery was one of the boldest that
has been reported for some time, particu
larly as it was committed in a thickly
settled part of the city, in fact, within a
six minutes' walk of Broadway. Thomp
son resides with his son-in-law, At
torney Will Powers, at . the corner of
Eighth and Jackson streets. He is 60
years of age, and not strong physically.
He had been out of work for a long time,
and the money stolen comprised his -first
earnings in the employ of the street de
partment.
Thompson was about ten feet from his
gate, when he stepped out of the way to
allow a pedestrian to pass. The latter,
however, suddenly grabbed Thompson by
both wrists and forcing his arms up said:
"Keep still, old man, and you won't get
hurt." At the same time an accomplice
ran across from the other side of the
street and immediately searched Thomp
son's clothes, secured his pocketbook and
disappeared in the darkness down Jackson
street. ,â â¢_
Thompson Is confident that he will be
able to identify the man who held him
should he be apprehended. As the robber
forced his arms up the old gentleman had
to drop a nackage he had carried under
his arms. In trying to kick this out of
the way the footpad's hat fell off and his
face was turned toward the light. Thomp
son says that the fellow is between 40 and
60 years old, rather stout, with a smooth
shaven face and short, iron-gray hair.
We are leaders in pocketbooks, trunks
and valises. Sanborn, Vail & Co.. 741

OAKLAND IS
GIVEN OVER
TO POLITICS
A Good Time to Use
Common Sense.
HOW TO AVOID SCANDALS
VOTERS SHOULD NOT BE LED
BY SOPHISTRIES.
â¢ -, i â ':'â '. " i
.- Out of thÂ« Army, of Candidates
Should Not Be Difficult to
Choose Trustworthy. .
Men. '
â â  ' Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
y.yy 90S Broadway; Feb. 12. .'
There are many sterling men running
for office at this time, but the*re is not
one worthy, in my opinion, -of .taking to
himself and debauching that great bat
' tie-cry of Manila and Santiago, "Remem
ber the Maine." . Ignorant and possibly
unpatriotic venders of peanuts or .special
. brands of soap may be pardoned, for be
ing led into such an error against good
taste. in advertising,: but there can be no
â excuse for an intelligent citizen consid
ered worthy of filling a public office doing
-any: such cheap, exploiting. -Yet around
.the -city I .'have noticed on the political
â¢ cards .of men who- dp and should know
better 'than to commit -such an offense
,- against decency, .'the â  quack- expression',
7 "remember the name." The Maine wilt
be remembered as long as the name, of
â¢ America exists, but it- Is just as sure that
many of the names now being placarded
in this city.-w ill", be as surely . forgotten
v â¢with this generation, some of them, with
this campaign.
';â '.': If there-. could be more work and. less . talk
.there would : be' a vast Improvement In. politics.
More business,- more work: for the floating popu
lation, is what? is. needed In Oakland.âOak
land Saturday Night.
This sentiment should be the text of
every, political speech during â¢ this: Cam
paign, and should just as certainly be the
motto of every Official elected to offlce.
In this city politics. amounts largely to
mouthings. Rarelyss anything pledged by
a party seeking an office- carried out. Tit
some manner or other enough little foxes
manage to. squeeze into the city admin
istration to spoil the vines, and even the
political -wisdom, of. a Solomon, has so. far
seemed unable to keep them out. -The
! same danger is threatening at this time. '
. There- are men before the community as
: candidates for . office who are no more fit
to be intrusted, with public cohndenceiand.
the expenditure of ..public money than they,
are fit to sit oh the throne of an ideal re
ligionist's heaven. On the. Other hard
there are plenty of .men who can be trust
ed; men of honor Who have . been tried
and Who would -never dream of betray
ing, a trust Or conniving .however mdi:
-: rectly at the theft of a single, cent from
..the city treasury. All. these men are how
ln the public eye, and it lis to be hoped
that the decent, vote of Oakland is am
ple to 7 guarantee . the election of. a city
government that will do. something and
not be given, to. making, pie-crust prom
ises which it has no intention or desire
to carry out. : . : â -. . ' "â  .
For one whole month each voter has a
duty to perform. In this time he owes
. It to himself and eVery fellow citizen to
examine the. character, the antecedents,
the alliances, and the ..influences which
surround every individual seeking public
favor. This is not a difficult task nor is
7it one that .should, be slighted?.. On its
performance faithfully depends the
â¢ status of this city for two years, perhaps
longer. It is easy to obtain all the neces
sary, Information regarding every candi
date, and if there be any candidate about
who so little is known, that his. standing
: cannot be ascertained?: It Is safe to say
that such a one is not the best man for
whom to vote.
It is true, as it always ha* been, that
CROWDS RUSH TO
INSPECT THE IOWA
The Water front Was Thronged With Thousands
;:: 7;7 : '' Anxious to Get Aboard.
THE battleship lowa .'was â¢ nearly
swamped with -visitors yesterday.
. During the entire afternoon she was
...;.. surrounded by craft of every descrip
tion, ' seeking to unload their human
freight upon her decks. Launches and
whltehalls were allowed alongside the
battleship, but tugs and stern-wheel
steamers had to discharge their passen
gers into small boats in order to get them
aboard.. This was very slow work, and'
In consequence there was soon a Jam.
alongside the man-of-war. Only' one boat .
could get to the. gangway at a time, and
about 2 p. m. there were from thirty to.
forty craft of all sorts and sizes awaiting
their turn. f
Many of the excursionists on the tugs
lost their patience and their temper and
.indulged in some pretty tall swearing. *
Aboard the lowa things were not in a ,
much better shape. It did not take-long
to land a couple of thousand people on

there is an element, having nothing at
stake except the satisfaction of their own
selfishness, who care nothing for the in
dividual or society at large. This element
.in this city is perhaps- no greater than in
any other city of the size of Oakland, but
it "is better organized. It possesses the
faculty of: making Itself felt on election
day, and If- If cannot succeed in electing
a sufficient ; portion of the city govern
ment to give it control,- it has frequently
succeeded in asserting ' its power suffi
ciently to block the honest efforts of the
majority, .and thus nullify the will of
the greater' portion of the voters. Plans
are even now being formulated to try to
bring about, a repetition of these tactics.
Trades are being made that will, it is
hoped; give to this undesirable element
at. least enough votes in the City. Council j
to overthrow- any . good measure that
might-be proposed even" if it cannot carry
out obnoxious -plans of Its own.
Any .one acquainted with affairs of this
city, can see many important questions
that will arise during the term of the
next Council. .Prominent among them is
the: water .rate matter. This is a com
plex affair that will require well balanced
minds and -men of Inflexible character to
handle. There' will, -undoubtedly, be an
other agitation regarding public parks,
and this- matter must be dealt with in
such a "way as to secure public parks If
the people desire them, but secure them
oh- such terms as will make It impossible
for the city government to be branded as
having had a personal Interest in the
transaction. The many improvements
contemplated and now under way in the
vicinity of Lake Merritt need very judi
cious administration. "While there can be
no "doubt that this beautiful section of
the city should be made as attractive as
possible, it Is imperative that the line be j
drawn between such work as Is of public |
benefit and such as will tend to partake j
of the nature, of personal benefits. Anoth- i
er important matter is the disposition of |
the Cemetery Creek Imbroglio. Already an j
ordinance has been passed to print ap
propriating an immense sum of money
from the taxes, that will not be fixed until ;
next October, for settling this question. j
It Is not possible or advisable at this time, j
in view of the many conflicting state- !
ments regarding Cemetery Creek, to offer |
a definite opinion, but it ls a public ques- j
tion of grave importance and will have to |
be determined in some manner or other !
by the next City Council.
j During, the past two years some pro
nounced-and permanent street Improve
. ments have been made, calling for the
â¢expenditure of huge sums. No fault can
i now be found with existing thoroughfares
] between East Oakland and the city
7 proper. A movement is already on foot
to settle upon one of .the arteries leading
to West Oakland and to place It in as
- good condition as the one to East Oak
land..'Out-north- the same' problem has
to be solved. -These matters all involve
large slices from ;the city treasury. They
all present a possibility for .crookedness,
and consequently- form an important ele
ment'ln the consideration of fit men for
the next city: government. There is also
a question of patronage which cannot be
hignOred. No- one can presume to say that
' durlhg the past two years the city patron
' age . has . been dispensed .in a manner
I most befitting the .dignity of Its govern
. men. or : the efficiency of some of its de
partments. â¢ This' patronage involves the
-expenditure of one-half, posssibly more,
of the entire income of the city, and It
cannot be placed ip the hands bf men too
honest for their positions.
The Board of Education is only of sec
ondary- importance, to the City Council.
The president of a large .political organi
zation told me recently that, he thought
.it. was a mistake for a municipal conven
tion, to be rushed- through in one night.
: He remarked .that In view of the impor
tance 1 of it's functions a second night
should always be. taken up in considera
tion of., candidates for the School Board.
This is true. Usually after the nomina
tion of the city ticket and the City Coun
cil, interest lags and the nomination of
School Directors is made in a hasty, per
functory manner.- -To what extent this is
true in regard to. the nominations recent
ly made I cannot, say, but it is not radi
cal to. say that the election of men who
appoint the teachers to- train the most
numerous portion* of the community
should engross the best attention of mu
nicipal, conventions. As a rule Oakland
has had good School Boards, and as
there is not much competition for places
on. the board in this campaign it is prob
able that the next board will be as con
scientious as those that have preceded it.
That good men have been nominated for
the Board of Education in.the past has
largely been due to luck more than to
careful thought aiid scrutiny on the part
of delegates. â  . - -
Just now all the candidates are resting
on their arms?' There are many platforms
before the public? "and in every one of
them are some planks that are highly
dangerous to active campaigners. â¢ No one
. seems to know at this time Just along
â¢finally to. clear the ladder and regulate
the Inflow arid outflow...' .'
â -. On the Wharves the crowd was even
worse than on the bay. It seemed as if
the whole town had taken advantage of
:th'e- fine' day to visit the battleship. Short
ly .before 3 p. m. Henry Peterson stopped
selling tickets for his boats, and mount
ing, a platform informed > the 'â ; waiting
crowd that all who had tickets and. want
ed to go home could- do so, and the tick
ets would be honored .next Wednesday or
.Sunday.- The majority followed Peterson's
. suggestion- but a number hung on and
went out on the launches as late as 5 p. m.
One of the most pleasant excursions >of
the afternoon was that of the Press- Club
to the lowa. It was participated In by
200 members and more than that numoer
of. ladles. * The State tug Governor
Markham had been placed. at the disposal
of the club, and In addition the big Sea
King and â¢ Captain -Titchworth's trim tug
Annie were engaged.- These three vessels
handled the excursion nicely. â¢ The club
members and their ladies embarked at â¢ 2
o'clock, and the - three tugs made a 7 trip
around â¢ the ; bay, first , visiting the Union
Iron Works for a cursory inspection of the
new battle-ship Wisconsin and the record
breaking Japanese cruiser . Chitose. Then
the procession wended its way out to tne
Golden Gate. Favored by balrhy weather
the cruise was â¢ a pleasant one. At 3
clock the Press . Club tugs drew 7up to

what lines the campaign should be prose
cuted. Each fears the other fellow, for,
after all, there is no doubt that a politi
cal campaign while It does not affect a
majority of the voters, does influence
enough of them to control the balance of
power. One of the â  issues will be a low
municipal tax. This will, of course, be
the slogan of the Davie faction. On the
other hand, arguments , will be made to
show that Davie's dollar tax did the city
no good, and this will be bandied back
and forth until the election. Another
plank which will require careful handling
by the politicians who would avoid pit
falls, is that relating to public parks.
Some of the platforms condemn them,
and others favor them. A thinker can
easily see that dangerous missiles can- be
hurled from either camp. Then there is
the always delicate liquor question, water
front litigation and- other. matters that
politicians would willingly steer clear of
at election time.
Many of the candidates are wishing
that fate would be as good to them now
as it was to Mayor Thomas two years
ago, when It kept him at home sick until
the night before the election, when he
was hurried to the Tabernacle, accom
panied by his doctor, and made one little
speech and was hurried home again be
fore any one had time to suggest any in
tricate queries, y _^
There is one other suggestion that is
very necessary. While walking around
one hears a great deal of whispering, and
in places where it. should not be. This
afternoon one Republican candidate ex
pressed all kinds of fear that the oppo
sition would put up some kind of a
scheme to defeat the Republican ticket.
He bemoaned the fact that such things
should be, and created an Impression that
he might be one of the unfortunates. Such
behavior is absurd, and Indicates the child
in politics. Of course, the opposition will
devise a scheme whereby It hopes to win.
It would not have nominated a ticket did
it not think so. This is no excuse, how
ever, for lying down before It, and there
by give It encouragement. There Is only
oneway under present circumstances of
electing the Republican ticket, and that Is
by standing together and working to
gether. Any individual candidate who
goes around with a downcast head should
resign, and not prove a millstone to his
fellows. There is no way to win except
by unity, and this is always understood
and carried out by the other fellow. There
ls in this city a Repub'iean majority
which, If combined, could elect every man
of Its party by long odds, and when
croakers come to the surface they should
be energetically put down.
It is not easy to see why the principle
of giving Christmas boxes to mailcarrlers
should not be extended to the carmen.
Of the two, perhaps the carman has the
harder and least pleasant, as he certain
ly has the least paid, lot. During the past
month the carmen of this city have not
been favored by the weather, and those
who travel frequently and regularly have
often missed the familiar face of the reg
ular motorneer or conductor. In a meas- |
ure they are as much public servants j
as are police officers or postmen, and in !
this, city, at least, they- are entitled to
more consideration than is usually shown !
to them. These remarks are prompted by ;
two incidents that have, been brought to ;
my notice. A few days ago I learned that
carmen were paying for rent and support
of a brother laid low from the effects of
his "late runs" when ice and frost were
holding carnival. It was all done unos
tentatiously and only by accident was it !
discovered. The other Incident ls the fact .
that next Tuesday the Carmen's Associa- !
tion is to hold its first annual reunion at |
Reed Hall. It is little short of a duty
to help out these noble fellows on this oc
casion. STUART W. BOOTH.
A FAMOUS CHOIR
FEELS HARD TIMES
OAKLAND'S FIRST M. E. CHURCH
MAY RETRENCH.
Funds Are Not Forthcoming to Meet
Demands of the Sweet
Singers.
. OAKLAND, Feb. 12.â Unless the purse !
strings of the well-to-do members of the I
First M. E. Church congregation are â 
loosened promptly, the large and well- j
appointed choir of twenty voices is in im- |
minent danger- of being Impaired mate- i
rially.
It was whispered about in religious cir
cles to-night that all is not peace and |
harmony in this aggregation of singers, <
and that a very material reduction is to I
be made in number and quality. The first '
of the foregoing statements is vigorously \
denied by Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille, the pas- !
tor,' and J. M. Robinson, who has served \
faithfully as leader of the choir for the
past six years. Both attribute the lm- j
aboard the vessel. They were shown
every consideration by the officers, and
spent an hour viewing the famous fight
ing craft. The excursion was. in every
way as successful as the previous outings
of this club have been. .
When the crowd was thickest around
the Folsom street float a gang of sneak
thieves began operating. Officers Shaw
Ellis and W. Coleman, of the harbor po
lice, were there in plain clothes, and they
kept close watch on - the light-fingered
gentry. Four of them were caught in the
act of robbing C. H. Crowell, of 3320 Sev
enteenth street. George Franklin, who
gave his occupation as a tailor; William
Thomas, who said he was a barber, and
James Fisher, who claims to be a painter
were caught, but the fourth member of"
the gang got away. Fisher had $2 05 in his
pockets besides > the purse he had stolen
rom Crowell, while â¢ Franklin â¢ had 21 40
and Thomas $5 50. ,*. They were locked up
at ' the harbor police station and . charged
with, grand larceny. . yy
Fisher, , alias Ryan, is an old offender
and . has only â¢ been , released ; from -: jail a
few weeks. His young, wife,:- carrying a
six-months-old -baby, ' was in ' the crowd
and she went up ;to her husband and
kissed him after the officers had hand
cuffed him. *
A force of police undeY Corporal "Bob"
Cockrell took care of -; the crowd at Fol
som street, and there were no accidents
of any description throughout the day. .
pending danger of : a reduction in the
Bervice to "hard times and lack of funds."
"There is no trouble in the choir," said
Leader Robinson, after the services to
night; "only, as I understand it, the funds
are so low that it will be necessary to re
duce the expenses."
Aside from Mr. Robinson, the twenty
voices include the leading soprano, Mrs.
Dewing, also a leading tenor, a bass and
contralto, , all ,of * whom are paid regular
salaries, aggregating about $1,800 per an
num, and apparently, though the congre
gation is one of the largest, most fash
ionable and well-to-do in this city, the
expenses have been met not without some
slight difficulty.
Dr. Dille stated, however, that while it
had not been definitely determined as
yet to reduce the choir, such action Is not
unlikely, owing entirely to financial
causes. J. A. Johnson, one of the church
trustees, commenting on the same subject,
said:
"Our choir is perhaps one of the best
appointed on this side of the bay, and
compares favorably with those of leading
churches in San Francisco, and it would
be a pity to impair its present excellent
quality. You see $1800 annually for choir
expenses: is a good deal, though we are
not complaining of the cost. It is the
matter of raising the money with which
to keep it up. I believe the big Unitarian
Church choir in San Francisco has had
to be reduced likewise. Hwever, we
have every hope that some amicable ar
rangement will be agreed upon by which
the excellence of our choir will not be
marred." . -:-y':.- ;

ALAMEDA SCRIBES
NEARLY MOREHOUSED
| DR. ALFRED SANDER GOES ON
THE WARPATH.
Bloodshed Threatened to Be the Se
quel to the Roebke-Green-
Sander Romance.
Alameda Offlce San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, Feb. 12.
The exclusive publication in this morn
ing's Call of the romance behind the love
affairs of Miss Amanda Roebke and Dr.
Jacob Green created a decided sensation
In Alameda society circles, and long be
fore noon a copy of the paper could not
be purchased here for any price.
Dr. Alfred Sander, who appeared as a
! conspicuous figure in the romance, went
;on the warpath .early in the* day and
j startled the community by chasing wild
!ly up and down Park street, with his
pockets full of pistols, prepared to "More
i house" the first newspaper man who
j crossed his pathâ correspondent pre
ferred.
Fortunately the scribes kept out of the
way and did not seek to interview the
angry medico until the police department
had been appealed to to cool him down.
Later In the day a meeting was arranged
between Dr. Sander and the representa
tive of this journal in the office of Chief
of Police Conrad. The doctor's affianced,
Miss Ruth Gruenberg, was present.
Brief! j', the physician said:
"I am glad now I did not meet you
this morning. If I had. one of us would
have shed blood. I had two pistols. Not
Intending to take advantage of you, I
proposed to lend you one with which to
protect yourself, if you were unarmed.
"I was never in love with Miss Amanda
Roebke, and any statements to the con
trary are untrue. Both she and 'Jakey'
Green worked for me. /My bookkeeper
caught them hugging and kissing each
other during offlce hours, and when he
told me I Informed Green's mother. That
Is all I have had to do with the affair.
This happened more than a year and a
half ago and I have not been mixed up
In any such matter since. If I was not to
be married to an estimable young lady
next Sunday I would have no complaint
to make with the story printed in The
Call this morning, but unde.r the circum
stances, it made me mad arid I firmly in
tended to set the matter right by shoot
ing the author."
The doctor promised that if the above
statement was published he would do no
killing for at least twenty-four hours.
A. M. Roebke. father of Miss Elsie, who
was credited with making the statement
that Dr. Sander was In love with her
sister, Amanda, and sought to prevent
her marriage with Dr. J. S. Green, when
the latter won her affections, says that
his daughter does not remember having
made such an announcement and that the
probability ls that a different meaning
rom that Intended has been given to
some Idle remarks she may have passed.
In the main, however, the story published
this morning Is correct and there is am
ple evidence to corroborate it.

FANNING FELL
SHORT OF HIS
OLD-TIME FORM
Failed to Kill His
Twelve Birds.
BEAT MANY EASTERN CRACKS
MET DEFEAT AT OLYMPIC GUN
CLUB SHOOT.
Next Sunday, However, He Will
Probably Shoot Again, and
Promises to Slay All
Birds.
Tod Sloan failed to appear at the Olym
pic Gun Club traps yesterday, but Eddie
Bald, the crack cycler, was there, and
as he shoots like Sloan, without taking j
aim, the crowd failed to greatly deplore \
the absence of "Lord Beresford's chum." j
The guest of the day, however, was Jack
Fanning, who for the past two years has |
represented the club in Eastern matches.
Lovers of the sport by the score went out
to see Fanning shoot. The money > was
not large enough to spur Fanning to his
best, however, and as a result he met de
feat. .
In the first 12-bird match J. Fanning
killed 10, Ed Fay 11, Slade 8, C. E. Nau
man 12, F. Ireland 10 and Ed Games 9.
Nauman's shooting was brilliant. He
killed his birds "clean" and seldom used
his second barrel. Two weeks ago Fay
made a record of 17 birds straight, using
his second barrel but" twice, and although
he killed all of his birds but one yester
day his record fell below that of two
weeks ago, as he used a second on three
birds that failed to show great speed.
In the second 12-bird match the shoot
ing was poor. Fred Feudner and Eddie
Bald entered, ut soon fell out. J. Cole
man killed 9 birds and Ed Kittleman got
7. A third 12-bird match was arranged,
and in this Nauman and Fay broke even,
each killing 12 straight and clean. Jack
Fanning got 10, Siade 10, Ireland 8 and
Feudner 9. In the next match Bald en
tered and stayed the matter out, but as
a shot he is not a success. He man
aged, however, to get 6 birds out of his
dozen, while Coleman got 9, Golcher 10.
Kittleman 7 and Games 6. The next and
last match was a six-bird. Bald came
in, exploded 11 shells and got 2 birds. He
bested Coleman, however, who only land
ed 1 of his half-dozen. Golcher got -lis
6 with 6 shells, Kittleman 2. Nauman 5
and Fanning 4. Another match, it is
thought, will be arranged for next Sun
day, and Fanning promises to redeem
himself, and he can, as Eastern cracks
will testify. >
Fanning met all the members of the
gun club at the beginning of the pocket
pool tournament, which opened Saturday
evening, where he was the guest of honor
and enjoyed the evening. The tournament
will not be concluded for several days.

Another Tesla Victim.
> OAKLAND, Feb. 12.â Another victim
has been added to the list of fatalities at
the coal mines in Tesla. Carl Brown, a
miner, while engaged in some small blast
ing in one of the tunnels was asphyxi
ated by ' the coal gas arising after the
blast. There were three other men en
gaged at work near by at the time, but
they escaped uninjured. When they saw
Brown fall they .attempted to reach his
side, but some moments elapsed before
they could finally carry him out of the
tunnel, and then Brown was beyond all
hope.
Deceased was a native of Germany,
aged 23 years and was unmarried.

7 Discovered with their 7 booty in their
..possession, two burglars early yesterday
morning made a desperate attempt on the
life of; Policeman John Lynch of the
Southern Station. Lynch was patrolling
his beat on Fifth street, and when pass
ing a lodging house near Jessie,: he re
ceived the. contents of a pitcher of water,
which was thrown from one of the upper
/rooms..- ' Lynch â¢ quickly entered the : house
â¢arid going to.? the room from which the
water came, demanded admittance.
â¢ For a reply.. the. two occupants extin-
: guished tin- light. Lynch forced open the
.door; and as he entered the room he was
: pel-zed by the desperate occupants, one of
whom attempted to throw him to the
floor. The officer; unable to get his club,
7 struggled with the men. One of them,
.evidently becoming alarmed for his. own
; safety, ran from the room, leaving his
â¢companion struggling with the brave po
â¢ liceman.
â  Lynch clung to his asssailant with the
7 tenacity, of a bulldog, and succeeded in
dragging him into the hallway. : .On
reaching the head of the stairs they both
fell. Lynch on top: They then rolled-down
â¢stairs, dragging the banister after them
..and arousing the Inmates. As they con
tinued struggling at the foot of the stairs,
â  Lynch managed to get his club and
. â truck .the burglar across the neck with
' it; coriipletely knocking him out.
â¢.The â¢â¢ screams of the inmates attracted
the attention of Sergeant Donovan, who
on rushing into house, discovered his
fellow-officer standing over the uncon
scious-crook.: ready, to again attack him
If â¢ necessary.' Thinking that the fellow
was seriously Injured. Donovan had him
removed to the Receiving Hospsital,
where he soon regained consciousness. In
the meantime the officers returned to the
room and . discovered several bundles of
linen which had been stolen from La
Grande Laundry on Howard street
The prisoner, who gave his name as

who escaped from the room, had broken
Into the laundry last Saturday night and

Sermon on Education.
A meeting of the Socialist Labor party
at Scottish Hall last evening was ad
dressed by Rev. Edward Payne on the
subject of "Education and Instruction."
The speaker condemned the modern sys
tem of education, as it tended to demor
alize the condition of the workingman.
He claimed that the instructors and edu
cators diffused principles aimed at the
suppression of the toiler whenever he be
came restive or sought to elevate himself
in. the scale of humanity.
HIS BRAINS BEATEN OUT.
Horrible Death of Herman Schmidt
at the Bavaria Brewery.
. Herman Schmidt, an engineer, residing
at 172 Minna street, met with an awful
death at half-past 2 o'clock yesterday
morning at the Bavaria Brewery, at
Greenwich and Scott streets. Schmidt in
company with A. B. Griffith went to the
brewery at 8 o'clock in the evening to -"-ty
a friendly visit to. Henry Dohring, the en
gineer of the brewery.
The visitors overstayed their intended
time and before they were aware- of the
fact the last car had left for the city.
Under the circumstances they agreed to
remain all night in' the brewery and re
turn home in the morning.
During the early hours Engineer Dohr
ing had occasion to leave the engine room,
and before doing. so asked Schmidt to
look after the engine until he returned.
In the meantime Griffith went to sleep on
a bench, and It is supposed that Schmidt
approached the fly wheel, where he was
caught and thrown into the pit. The
accident threw off the belt and stopped
the machinery. This notified Dohring
that something was amiss in the engine
room, and on his return he was horrified
to find Schmidt lying In the wheel pit
with his right arm torn out from t..e
shoulder socket, his head mashed into a
mass of pulp and his brains scattered all
about the place.
' The Coroner was notified, and Deputy
Coroner John F. Gately collected the
fragments and took them to the Morgue.
Schmidt was a native of Missouri, and a
married man. , . -

A GIFTED MISSIONARY.
Miss Henrietta Bancroft Lectures at
. the Central Methodist Church.
The Sunday morning address at the
Central Methodist Episcopal Church.yes
terday was delivered by Miss Henrietta
Bancroft, the field secretary of the
Women's Home Missionary Society.. As
this marked the initial address of Miss
Bancroft in t__s city, the church was
crowded to Its capacity with people from
all over "the city who availed? themselves of
the. opportunity to hear the gifted woman,
who has done so much in behalf of re
ligion, and especially suffering and pov
erty stricken women in the large Eastern
centers of population. .
The subject she chose to lecture upon
was. "Am I My Brother's Keeper?" Tne
speaker emphasized the theory that the
quotation in the sense in which It is given
is true. Every man should help his fel
low-man arid do everything. In his power
to assist and alleviate the sufferings of
those, who are less fortunate than he.
During â¢ the â  course of the lecture ' the
growth and history of . the church was
outlined and its epochs defined. The lec
tone was concluded with an appeal to the
members of the congregation to assist in
spreading the good work which is now so

Disaster Attends New Year Festivities.
DEATH RESULTS
FROM NEW YEAR
CELE BRATION
Quong Duck Fook Incinerated and
Three Others Fatally Burned
on Commercial Street.
The Blaze Started by the Explosion of
Firecrackers at the Rooms of the
Alaska Packing Companyâ Police
Rescue Five People.
Fireworks exploded ln celebration of the
Chinese New Year by the Alaska Packing
Company, at 724 Commercial street, yes
terday, afternoon, set lire to the building-,
completely destroying the contents of the
second story, burned one Chinaman to
death and so badly scorched three others
that there Is no chance for their recovery.
The Are started at exactly 4 o'clock, and
within twenty minutes after the crackers
had been- lighted the damage had been
done and the flames extinguished. A long
string of firecrackers was lowered from
a window in the second â¢ story to the
street, some twelve feet beyond the side
walk, and as the clock struck 4 a match
was touched to the fuse. The flame ran
rapidly along a wooden chute in which
the fireworks had been placed and com
municated with other fireworks stored
near the window of the second story.
These . exploded, and in a very few mo
ments the entire room . was filled j with
flames. Tinsel and the paper decorations
made excellent fuel for the fire, which
spread rapidly, to adjoining rooms.
By a fortunate circumstance the police
were on the scene at the time the fire
broke out, and to this fact it is due that
there were no more lives' lost. There has
been considerable rivalry among the dif
ferent packing and fishing companies, and
each sought to outdo the others in the.
display of fireworks, thinking that the one
making the best show would be able to
secure the most men to supply the vessels
with fishermen. The Alaska Company
purchased about $700 Worth of fireworks,
and believing that this was more than
any other company would have there was.
considerable fear, that the rival compa
nies might seek to interfere with the cel
ebration. Jue Bun, the head man of the
company, informed Lieutenant Price of
this fear and requested that officers be de
tailed to prevent any Interference with
the celebration, The lieutenant acceded
to the request, stationed. Policemen Slat
terv, " Bunner. Grunwald . and Brodt in
front of the building and remained with,
them himself.
As soon as the flames spread through
the rooms Lieutenant Price turned in an
alarm for the Fife Department and sent
the officers for. ladders with which to res
cue the. people in' the building. The wife
and two daughters of Jue Bun and two
men were carried down the ladders by
the police, and over a dozen other China
men escaped down .the stairway. Until
the firemen entered the building it was
believed 'that all the inmates had escaped
without serious Injury.
Engineer P: H.. Shaughnessy and Wil-
Ham Gallatin of chemical entrine 5. while
fighting the flames in the room at the rear
of the one where the. fire started, found
two Chinamen so badly burned that they
could not escape. â¢ These were carried
down the main stairway to the sidewalk.
Another man," also horribly burned, was
discovered by Assistant Engineer John
Willis in an Inner room, and he was car
ried down a ladder and placed, with the
other victims: ... Further' search resulted
in the finding of the dead body of Quong
Duck. Fook. â¢ ' â¢
Jue Mow, Jim Shoo and Chan Wo, the
three 'men rescued,- were horrible sights
for the large crowd which gathered, in the
street hear the burning building. â¢' The
hair had been singed from their heads,
the clothing burned from their bodies and
the flesh on their hands, feet and faces
burned to a crisp. They lay on the side
walk writhing, moaning and groaning in
their agony.. .The ambulance. was sum
moned as quickly as possible and the suf
ferers were taken to the Harbor Hospital.
At a late hour last night all three of. the
Injured men were still alive, but the phy
sicians in attendance state that there is
no possible chance for the recovery of any
of them.
Quong Duck Fook, the man who lost
his life In the fire, was a member, of the
Alaska Packing Company, and was pos
sessed of a number of other interests. He
leaves a widow arid three children resid
ing at 717 Clay street. â¢ It Is stated that he
escaped from the building: when the .fire
first started, but ran; back into the build
ing to save a large sum of money. His
effort, aside from the. fact that It cost
him his life, was unsuccessful, as when
the body was searched at the Morgue but
$5 was found in his possession.
There is ' a possibility that -another
Chinaman. was burned to death in the Are,
but the truth of a rumor to that effect
could not be established. Several intelli
gent Chinamen, who were on the scene
immediately after the' fire started, state
that one man -was taken from the build
ing by some of his countrymen and spirit
ed away. Some , say that he was dead
when carried from the building while
others state that he was still alive, but
so badly burned that he cannot recover.
The reason given' for the concealment of
the body is that the Chinese have a hor
ror of the Morgue and labor under the
belief that .those taken there will not re
ceive a proper burial. While there may be
some foundation for the rumor It is
probable that the man taken away was.
but slightly burned. Several of the men
In the rooms received injuries which,
while painful, are not serious. Among
these ls Jue Bun, who had his face burned
and his hair singed.
The accident has placed a damper on
the New Year's celebrations throughout
the entire Chinese colony. Few China
men were on the streets last night, and
the firing of crackers and bombs at the
hours allowed by the police has been
much less than before the disaster. The
"Kong He Fa Choys" are given with less
heart. Wishes of good luck and a pros
perous year to the victims of the fire
availed them naught, and the survivors
have come to the belief that the wishes
of their, friends may not be more potent.
Yesterday's catastrophe has caused the
remarks that Sunday seems productive of
fires, as within the past four weeks every
ilre which has resulted In death has ocr
curred on the Sabbath. On January 22
Miss Jeannie. A. Moore was burned to
death at her home on Devisadero street,
and Mrs. Catherine Grey died from burns.
The following Sunday Matthlus Eichorn
met death in a fire at the San Bruno
Hotel, and Thomas W. Rollet was Incin
erated at the Pacific Gas Works.
EXPLODING GUN COTTON.
Causes a Conflagration in the Office of
the Equitable Gas Company.
A fire broke out in the offices of the
Equitable Gas Light. Company, 632 Mar
ket- street, 'yesterday afternoon. The
blaze was caused by an explosion of gun
cotton, and for a time threatened destruc
tion to the entire building, which contains
many offices of insurance, railroad and
steamship companies: An alarm was im
mediately turned In from box 48, and the
fire .companies were quick in responding.
As the flames were confined to the third
floor the firemen easily reached them from
the roof, and they were subdued with lit
tle damage to the building. The entire
loss will probably be covered by $300.
Struck With, a Lantern.
A man named Grant, an employe In' the
stables of E. J. Baldwin, was brought to
the Receiving Hospital last evening In a
dying condition, having been struck over
the head with a railroad lantern, as the
result of a quarrel among the Baldwin
stablemen. . ' .
Thomas Smith and Daniel .Hfckey .were
fighting .when Grant tried to separate
them. The combatants were striking at
each other furiously In the dim light of
the stable, and one of them felled Grant
to the floor with the lantern. It is said
one of the men was stabbed with . a pitch
fork, but as no arrests Were -made this
cannot be verified. Grant's skull is" frac
tured and the physicians think he will
die. .. . <

After some delay in inflating his bal
loon, C. M? Vosmer, the! aeronaut who
was injured last October, made a success

WILL WIPE OUT
THE BIG DEFICIT
SUPERVISORS WILL TAKE AC-
TfON TO-DAY.
Reductions in Certain Appropriations
Will Be Applied to Paying the .
â¢Old Debts. ".
'â¢ At to-day's meeting of the' Board of Su
pervisors Chairman Perrault of the Fir
nance Committee will -present a plan, to
pay off the legacies of the old board of
malodorous memory, which will allow
their successors in offlce to start, with a
clean bill. The plan -will consist in apply
ing: moneys by which certain appropria
tions have been reduced, notably the $40.
--000 on the gas contract. The appropriation
of $85,000 for furnishing the. new Hall of
Justice has been cut to $"".,000, thus effect
ing a saving of $20,000, and this will Join
the $40,000 in settling up the deficit. Then
there is the $6800 which has been saved by
reason of the abandonment of. the filter
ing scheme for the new City Hall. The
resolutions providing for an- additional
twenty-five policemen for. this city and
county, which failed of passage, will al
low $10,000 to be used for "other purposes,
and this, together with the $10,000 reduc
tion on the proposed police station for
i the Mission district, will give the board
$86,800, which will go far toward cleaning,
lup the municipal debts. The plan is a
praiseworthy one. and creditors of- the
city, who were beginning to despair of
ever getting their money, may now see
some prospect of relief. â¢ Â. .. '
There is no change in the situation be
tween Tax Collector Sheehan and the Su
pervisors. To-day Judge Hebbard will hear
i the mandamus proceedings and on
! Wednesday he â¢ will probably . decide
:' whether the board is compelled to sign
! the demands of the clerks employed by
Sheehan* during the month of January.
If he so decides, then Sheehan is at lib
l erty to .hire as many* clerks' as he chooses,
; and the controversy .will die a natural
i death. Supervisor Perrault denies that it
is a question of patronage. He insists that
< it is a plain business proposition, and
! patronage cuts no figure in the matter at
all. He bases his contention as tothe right
of the Supervisors in the case on section
20. which reads that the Supervisors shall
have absolute control of the expenditures
Of the Tax - Collectors, Assessor's and
Auditor's offices.. 'â¢ ' â 
"If the decision is against the board,
says Perrault,. in favor of Mr. .Shee
, han. of course that will' settle the differ
-1 ences. In the' event that Judge Hebbard
1 decides -that Sheehan- has a right to em
ploy any number, of ben he may select it
â  will practically nullify the intent of section
, 20, and whatever demands. he may present
: to the board from month- to month must
! of necessity be- signed, as it can exert no
1 control over his acts in the matter of ap-.
' propriations for his' office. 'â¢' â  y â 
The water question will not be .taken
