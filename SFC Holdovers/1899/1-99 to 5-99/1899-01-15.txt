|i 4 CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 14.â
:. â â â¢â ;.â ]â  toward E. Wright of Berkeley, Speaker of the Assembly, re
ceived Si 6so from U. S. Grant Jr. through his political mana
:...â¢â  ger, Milton S. Green, in return for the promise that he would
ite for Grant for United States Senator.
Mr. Wright has failed to keep his promise and carry out his
.â¢â¢â¢part of the bargain and sale. Instead of voting for Grant he
../.-.â¢has elected to cast his Senatorial ballot for D. M. Burns, in de
fiance of the wishes of the people who elected him. He would
,'.â ; not stay bought. The nature and amount of the obligation ac
â¢â ; : knowledged by Mr. Wright when he cast his vote for Burns are
. only partially known. Precise knowledge on this point is unr
\/ -necessary, as the rules of trade are sufficiently familiar to the
:,\ people of this State to enable them to form a reasonably correct
in the matter, the amount paid by Grant being
â v'vJdiown. Mr. Green acknowledged having paid Mr. Wright the
1 â â¢-money, and also that he paid it for the purpose mentioned. My.
:;:. Wright admits having received the money from Mr. Green, and
>.; -also that it was paid to him under the distinct understanding
.^/tjiat he should vote for U. S. Grant for Senator. There can be
;:â¢:; .no mistake. Aside from Mr. Wright's admission and Mr. Green's
;;; ; acknowledgment, there are letters and receipts in existence
W which fully prove the facts as they are here stated.
There are two other matters upon which Mr. Wright
. V touches in his admission which should be mentioned at this
â¢:â¢; point. One is the statement, the truth of which cannot be
.. vouched for at this time by The Call, that Wright went to W.
F. Herrin, manager of the Southern Pacific Company political
bureau, and asked for $1200 with which to defray his election,
expenses. Mr. Herrin, according to the statement, declined to
pay over so large an amount oi money at one time, but com pro
mised by paving Mr. Wright $800.
The other is Mr. Wright's sworn statement of the amount
of money expended by him during the campaign, as provided
for by the purity of election law. According to Mr. Wright's
sworn statement, now on file in the office of the County Clerk
of Alameda County, he spent a maximum sum of $74 during the
campaign. In his confession Mr. Wright declares that the
money he received from Milton Green in return for his prom
. ises of support of the Senatorial candidacy of U. S. Grant was
put into his own campaign in order to insure his election to the
Assembly. In making this statement Mr. Wright confesses him
self a perjurer.
Finally, Mr. Wright acknowledges that he is going to con
tinue to vote for and work for D. M. Burns, and that he in
tends to ease his conscience by making restitution to Mr. Grant
within a few days.
Mr. Wright's admission was made to a representative of
The Call at the Golden Eagle Hotel in this city last evening.
It was as follows:
"I am forced to admit the truth of the statement that I
received money from U. S. Grant, or, rather, from Milton S.
Green, his political manager, with the understanding that I
should support Mr. Grant's Senatorial candidacy. I am now
supporting D. M. Burns, and I intend to return the money I re
: ceived from Mr. Grant through Mr. Green.
"I went to Mr. Green prior to the meeting of my district
convention pnd told him that I needed money to buy off a man
named Pringle, who also wanted the nomination for Assembly
man in my district, I told Mr. Green that I was friendly to Mr.
Grant and felt kindly toward his Senatorial aspirations.' I told
him that I would have to have $200 right away to buy off Prin
gle. He gave me the money and afterward gave me $400 more.
"I was in a bad way financially and after the campaign was
.opened I stopped in Sacramento on my way to Grants Pass to
close a land deal. While here I wrote to Mr. Green from the
Sutter Club, telling him that I needed a certain amount of
â¢ money to meet a very pressing debt. ; Mr. Green paid the debt
for me.
"In all I received $1650 from Mr. Green. Circumstances
have intervened to prevent me voting for Mr. Grant for Sena
tor. I feel that I owe it to Mr. Grant and to myself to pay
. back the money that was given me prior to my election, and I
: intend to do so within a few days.
"I never received any money from Mr. W. F. Hexrin of

the Southern Paciiic Company. I intended to go to him for
money, but Guy Earl advised me not to do so. It is not true that
1 asked Herrin for Si 200, and that I told him that $200 of the
amount was for the purpose of inducing Pringle to withdraw
from the contest for the nomination in my district. I deny that
I asked for $1200 and that Herrin gave me $800.
"I had a hard tight in my district and most of the money
I received from Mr. Grant through Mr. Green 1 put into my
campaign.
''I intended to carry out my promise to vote for Grant, but
when the scandal about Clough and the others became public
I made up my mind that I would get' out before an exposure
came. I thought I could get out and pay back the money, and
thus save myself."
Such is the admission of Howard E. Wright, Speaker of the
Assembly, the man who played the part of traitor to the voters
of his district by voting for D. M. Burns against their ex
pressed wish. This is the man who, as Speaker of the Assem
bly, threatened last night to make an order expelling the legis
lative correspondents of this paper from the floor of the Assem
bly because they have been instrumental in exposing the man
ner in which two of the Senatorial candidates have debauched
and are seeking to debauch legislators.
The attention of the honest
and honorable members of the
Assembly is called to the facts
concerning Speaker Wright as
they are set forth in this article,
and the public is left to judge as
to who should be expelled from
the Assembly chamber â the men
who have exposed him or he who
has violated the trust imposed on
him by law and society.

WRIGHT'S STATEMENT
OAKLAND, Jan. 14.â "There is not a
particle of truth in the story that I re
ceived any consideration from Howard
Wright for getting out of the Assembly

"I was forced out of the fight and was
not reimbursed even for the political

STRONG ANTITHESIS TO WRIGHT'S ACTION
After All His Boasting of Gains That fere to Come,
Burns Stands Jnst Where He Did at the Close of
the Previous Day's Balloting.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14.-C, B. JILSON OF
SISKIYOU AND HOWARD E.
WRIGHT OF ALAMEDA remain on
the roll of dishoner. Four ballots were
taken for United States Senator to-day
and on each ballot these two men voted
for D. M. Burns. They expected that
three others would join them in betray
ing the people, but their hopes in this
regard were not realized.
The strength of Burns was dim
inished to-day by the absence of As
semblyman Miller of San Francisco.
General Barnes sustained the loss of
one vote by reason of Senator Strat
ton's absence. Assemblyman Cheno
weth would have voted for Grant had
he been present and twenty-eight votes
would have then been cast for Grant.
As it â *. as Assemblyman Marvin of
Humboldt went back to the Grant fold,
thus enabling the San Diego aspirant
to maintain his strength of twenty
seven.
The event of the session to-day was
the spontaneous and prolonged ap
plause which followed the announce
ment of Assemblyman Knights' vote
for W. H. L. Barnes. It was common
talk in Sacramento last night and the
statement was published in the San
Francisco press that Mr. Knights had
been "stood up" by the railroad in
fluence controlling the Republican
County Committee of Sacramento and
compelled to desert General Barnes'
cause and enroll himself for Burns.
Profound silence reigned when the
chief clerk of the Assembly called the
name of Knights. When the Assembly
man responded, "W. H. L. Barnes," the
admiring applause evinced in the clap
ping of hands vigorously was prolonged
and renewed. The members on the
floor and the spectators in the lobby
and gallery participated in the tribute
to a man who had manifested the cour
age to stand up for the rights of the
people against the trickery and bull
dosing of the railroad gang and the
touts of Dan Burns. The approval was
not manifested by the shouts of the
rough element, but the volume and
character of the applause testified that
the good people, in their joy that this
Assemblyman had displayed in the
open the courage of his honest senti
ments, were proud of him and honored
the record he had made for himself
and the State.
To-day the name of William D.
Knights, the courageous man who rep
resents the Twenty-first Assembly Dis
trict in the Legislature, is honored
throughout the length and breadth of
the fair State of California. In the
camp of Dan Burns there is infinitely
more respect entertained for him than
for a thousand Jilsons or Wrights of
the legislative ilk. Whatever may be
the political faults and failings of Dan
Burns he has nothing but contempt for
a fellow creature who falls down.
After all the boasting and vaunting
of the "Colonel's" friends concerning
the Candelaria gains on the balloting
to-day. Burns is just where he stood
yesterday., counting the absentee, Mil
ler, in his favor. The hopelessness of
the struggle to elect Burns United
States Senator is now obvious to his
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
friends. It Is recognized that the moral
influences of the commonwealth have
been aroused to action. Multitudes of
j letters and messages arriving here,
calls for mass meetings at home and a
widespread sentiment of resentment
against his candidacy have served to
convince the supporters of the Colonel
that the people cannot be ignored in
the selection of a Senator to represent
California in Congress.
The outlook for Grant is equally aa
gloomy and hopeless as that for Burns.
Boodle is the one element that has ad
vanced Grant's voting strength to
twenty-seven. The proof of the bood
ling is now so direct and overwhelming
that no more gains can be accomplished
by corrupt tactics. The managers of
the Grant campaign ought to compre
hend the real facts of the situation and
relieve the San Diego statesman from
further distress in the fight. The Burns
men are firm and resolute in their de
termination to defeat Grant. In the
light of transactions no longer con
cealed from the public gaze it is doubt
ful if Grant could hold his seat in the
United States Senate if he should re
ceive the requisite number of votes for
a choice. The scandalous use of money
to procure his election would be the
subject of Congressional investigation
as soon as the facts were officially pre
sented to the Senate.
It was fancied by some of the specta-
I tors that the Burns men would rally a
man or two on the fourth ballot, as
they made a grandstand play against
adjournment, but the play was called
by members voting against the propo
sition to adjourn. The strength of the
Mexican was not increased on the
fourth show down of the day. The bal
loting next Monday may record some
changes. General Barnes is in a fair
way to gain a few votes. He has held
his own steadily from the beginning
and made one advance. The General
went to San Francisco to-day, but will
return to his headquarters to-morrow
evening. He is the popular man of the
hour and every change in his favor
enlists applause. He has conducted his
campaign in a spirit of friendship and
cordiality for other candidates.
KNIGHTS WILL NOT GO
AGAINST HIS CONSTITUENTS.

' Knights refuses to accept the dictation

i poration.
There is only one way open whereby
Mr. Knights can be prevailed upon to
change his vote in the Senatorial con2
INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO
te.et. If a mass-meeting of the voters
;OI his Assembly district is called and
the sentiment expressed by that mass
meeting is clearly indicative of a desire
fpr the Assemblyman to cast his
vote for some Senatorial candidate
6ther than General Barne*, then Mr.
Knights will carry out the wishes of his
people as shown by the mass conven
tion.
But he will not accept the dictum of
any packed assemblage. He does not
propose to be deceived by any gather
ing of race track touts and Southern
facine wire pullers who might possibly
assemble at some point in the Twenty
first District and endeavor to mold
public sentiment.
The mass meeting must be attended
and participated in by the representa
tive citizens of the district before Mr.
Knights will be in any way guided by
its action.
Last evening Mr. Knights was taken
. to Colonel Burns' headquarters
.prest-nted t<. him. He had at that time
concluded to accept the action of the
Republican committee of Sacramento
County as an expression of the wishes
of his constituents. He therefore in
formed Colonel Burns that he would
vote for him to-day.
Air. Knights fully intended to do so,
but before the Senate and Assembly-
convened In Joint session this morning
a committee of the most responsible cit
izens, including prominent business and
professional men, called upon Mr.
Knights, and in the name ot the re
spectable and honorable people of the
Twenty-first Assembly District they
asked that he continue to vote for (Jen
oral W. H. L. Barnes.
This expression, coming from the high
source it did, convinced Mr. Knights
that the action of the Republican com
mittee in indorsing Burns meant noth
ing. He saw that it had been brought
about by unfair methods and at the
BOle dictation of the political agents of
W. F. Herrin and J. B. Wright. He
thereupon assured the committee that
he would continue to vote for General
Barnes until his constituents expressed
a desire for him to do otherwise.
. After the Assembly adjourned this
afternoon Assemblyman Knights' desk,
which is situated in the center of the
hall, on the main aisle, was surrounded
by a number of admiring Senators and
Assemblymen. They pushed forward
and grasped his hand and extended to
him hearty congratulations for his bold
and manly stand. Mis. Knights was
sitting by his side, ami a gladsome
smile of pleasure graced her expressive
features as she looked up and saw her
husband receiving the applause of his
fellow-members and friends for having
given such unmistakable evidence that
he was every inch a man.
"Until the voters of my Assembly
district indicate to rtÂ»e beyond any
doubt that they desire me to change
my vote from General Barnes to some
other Senatorial candidate I do not
propose to do so," said Mr. Knights to
a representative of The Call. "Last
evening after the County Committee
hii% indorsed Colonel Burns I believed
th.it it was an expression which 1
should heed. I was taken to Colonel
Burns and presented to him. I said to
him that I would cast my vote for him
to-day. I fully intended to do so. But
this morning I was waited upon by a
company of gentlemen, constituents of
mine, sufficient In numbers â of unques
tioned character and standing â to sat
isfy me that they spoke for the district.
They request! d me to continue to vote
for General Barnes. I informed them
that I would do bo, because I felt con-
fldent from their representative char
acter they expressed thf true and un^
biased wishes of my people.
"I propose to continue in my present
course until it is demonstrated to my
satisfaction that my constituents want
me to change. When 1 am satisfied
that they desire that I should support
gome other candidate then I will do 30,
but not till then.
"I do not iir.'pns.' to do the bidding of
any corporation as long as 1 am in this
Legislature. The best way to determine
thf sentiment of the people of my dis
trict as to whether or not I should
change my vote is by a mass-meeting
of the representative men of the dis
trict. By the action of that maÃe-meet
ing. if it is a representative gathering,
I would be largely guided. But I am
not KÂ°ingr to be duped, bulldosed or
coerced."
This is the statement of a brave,
courageous and honorable man who is
striving to do his full duty as he sees
it and who will not be led astray by
Herrin and his gang of political high
binder?. '
THE DAY'S BALLOTING
BROUGHT ONE CHANGE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14- â Assemblyman
Knights of Sacramento voted for Dan
Burns on neither one of the four
joint ballots taken to-day for United
States Senator. On the contrary As
semblyman Knights kept right on vot
ing for General W. H. L. Barnes, and
for his constancy he was rewarded with
as mighty and hearty a shout of com
mendation as ever went up in the As
sembly chamber.
All through the morning the Burns
forces had advertised it in every cor
ner of the hall that Knights had been
won over. Not won but forced. Shame
lessly they boasted that the weight of
Herrin's influence invoked in their
cause yesterday and the made-to-order
instructions of the Sacramento County
Republican Central Committee had
availed and that the first ballot would
see Knights sign his name to the black
list. Every member on the floor was
made aware of their supposed tfeccesS
nor was the Senate neglected, and
j everything was done that could be to
use the fact as a lever and moral
weight on other contrary votes.
But Knights rendered their boasting
of no effect. He was seated at his desk
with Jlrs. Knights and a party of
friend* when the ballot began and at
tracted no more attention than any of
the Burns crowd. That is Mr. Knights
did not until his name "was reached in
the roll call. Then he became for longer
than Speaker Wright cared to rap with
his gavel the man of the house, and
no one of his friends looked so pleased
as did Mrs. Knights when he answered
"Barnes" to the roll cA(I in a voice that
said he meant it. Cheers went up from
all over the hall and the man who did
i not go to the Mexican was so much
embarrassed that his wife was com
pelled to bow his acknowledgments.
Assemblyman Marvin of Humboldt
also precipitated applause. After shin
ing for two days as Charles N. Felton's
other vote Dr. Marvin returned to the
camp of Grant, .there to remain for an
indefinite period. Dr. Marvin has gained
a reputation as a natural born switcher
since this joint ballot began. He opened
it by putting George A. Knight in
nomination for the Senate. He was sec
onded in his nomination by Boynton of
j Humboldt and for the day represented
the Knight strength on the lloor. Dr.
Marvin went over to Felton next day
and there remained until to-day, when
he decided to represent Grant's gain
of one.
"Although the San Diegan rolled up
only twenty-seven votes to-day he is
actually entitled to one more; that of
Chenoweth of Orange, who was ab
sent through the day because of the
serious illness of his mother. Mr. Che
noweth has been a persistent Grant
voter from the start and has announced
his intention of remaining as such so
the southrons were not worried to-day
when he failed to transpire. Senator
Stratum was another of the absentees
anc 1 General Barnes' total was not as
large by one because of it, but Stratton
will be on hand Monday and his vote
will be ca6t as formerly.
There was a good bit of wrangling
after the second ballot and only a roll
call would settle whether the voting
would continue or adjournment be
taken. The vote decided for the ballot
and things progressed evenly until the
fourth had oeen taken and no change
resulted, when another fight was pre
cipitated and an opportunity created
for the Garfield of Santa Clara to come j
to the front with a grandstand play
for his Mexican master. He was in one
of those close communions with himself
that have been since the session opened
the one relaxation of a hard-worked
Senator. The Shortridge communion
was In active operation throughout the
roll call until the name broke the
Shortridge trance, and instead of giving
off a commonplace "Aye" or "No" the
pride of the valley, one hand on his
bosom, shouted lustily, "Dan M.
Burns." He was jeered to the echo,
but that's naught to a Shortridge, and
satisfied with having relieved the ten
si-. n of more serious matters the trance
was resumed.
Pursuant to the decision had in cau
cus yesterday the Democratic minority
stayed with its politics and voted an
other list of party favorites. On the
first ballot Judge Coffey of San Fran
cisco was honored; on the second
Judge William M. Conley of Madera;
on the third General Hamilton of
Placer, and the fourth Charles D. Lane.
The first ballot resulted as follows:
For Barnesâ Senators Dickinson, Luch
singer, Morehouse; AssemDlymen Ather
ton. Clough, Knights, Knowlton, Lard
ner, Muenterâ 9
For Bullaâ Senators Currier, i-.mpson;
Assemblymen Belshaw, Conrey, Cosper,
Mellick, Miller of Los Angeles, Robin
son, Valentineâ 9.
For Burns â Senators Bettman,
Burnett, Hoey, Laird, Leavitt, Short
ridge, Wolfe; Assemblymen Arne
rich, Barry, Beecher, Cobb, Devoto,
Dibble, Henry, JILSON, Johnson,
Kelsey, Kelley, Kenneally, Lund
quist, McKeen, Pierce, Rickard, Eu
gene Sullivan, WBIGHTâ 2S.
For Grantâ Senators Boyce, Cutter,
Jonts. Maggard. Nutt. Smith. Trout;
Assemblymen Bliss. Blood. Cargill, Clark,
Crowder, Dole, De Lancie. Greenwell,
Le Barron. McDonald of Alameda, Mc-
Donald of Tuolumne, Merrill, Merritt, Mil
ice Radcliff, Raub, Raw, Works, Huber
â27.
For Knightâ Senator Gillette, Assembly
man Boyntonâ 2.
For Feltonâ Assemblyman Brownâ l.
For Scottâ Senator Davis, Assemblyman
Dun lapâ 2.
For Rosenfeldâ Senators Feeney, Hall
â2.
For Bardâ Senators Flint, Rowellâ 2.
For Fatersonâ Senator Taylor, Assem
blyman La Bareeâ 2.
For Estee â Assemblymen Anderson,
Wadeâ 2.
The second was the same as the first
with the exception of the name of the
minoritiy candidate. The third and
fourth ballots brought no change and
adjournment of the joint convention
was taken to Tuesday at noon, when
the fight will be resumed.
ROUTINE WORK IN
THE SENATE CHAMBER
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MKNTO, Jan. 14.â U. S. Grant, Mayor
James D. Phelan of San Francisco and
Charles L. Patton were among the visit,
ors to the Senate chamber this morning,
and were interested spectators of the pro
ceedings.
One of the most important matters pre
sented for the consideration of the Sena
tors was Trout's constitutional amend
ment abolishing the Board of Railroad
Commissioners. It is the same as the
amendment already introduced in the As*
sÂ«>mbly by Radoliff, and as both gentle
men are from Santa Cruz it would appear
aa though that county had a special an
tipathy to the board. The proposed
amendment reads as follows:
"A resolution to propose to the people
of the State of California the repeal of
section 22 of article XII of the constitu
tion in relation to Railroad Commission-
ers.
"Resolved by the Senate, the ABsembly
concurring, That the Legislature of the
State of California at its regular session,
commencing on the second day of Janu
ary, IS-K9, two-thirds of the members elect
ed to each of the two houses voting in
favor thereof, hereby propose that sec
tion 22 of article XII of the constitution
of the State of California be repealed."
The question of the necessity of ballot
ing for United States Senator on Sunday
was brought up and quickly decided In
the negative. Bettman moved that when
the Senate ndjourned it be until Monday.
Simpson wanted to know if a ballot was
necessary^ to-morrow. Bettman read the
following telegram from Senator Perkins
in reply to one sent by Bettman asking
for an opinion in the matter:

GEORGE C. PERKINS.-
Morehouse said he had looked up all the
laws bearing on the subject and was sat
isfied that no vote was necessary Â«n Sun
day. The motion was carried unani
mously.
Dickinson, from the Finance Committee,
Introduced four bills prepared by the Con
troller, one of which amends the act gov
erning commitments to Whittier; the sec

the estates of deceased persons fund.
After adopting the report of the janitor
regarding the purchase of new furniture
for the Senate chamber and commlttee-
rooms, Assembly concurrent resolution
relating to the conversion and appropria
tion of the waters of streams for irriga
tion purposes was read and referred to
the Federal Relations Committee.
Assembly Joint resolution No. 3, in
structing the Congressional delegation to
endeavor to secure an appropriation for
the completion of the jetty in San Diego
harbor, was adopted under a suspension
of the rules.
Wolfe Introduced a bill to compel sav

of all unclaimed deposits in their keeping.
Referred to the Committee on Banks and
Banking.
ASSEMBLYMAN DIBBLE MOVES TO ADJOURN TILL MONDAY.
Sims offered a resolution, which was
adopted, instructing the State Printer to
print 600 copies of ex-Governor Budd's
second biennial message and COO copies of
Governor Gage's inaugural address.
Resolutions authorizing the president of
the Senate to increase the County Govern
ment and Township Organization and the
Roads and Highways committees by two
members each were referred to the; Com
mittee on Rules.
Gillette offered a concurrent resolution
which was referred to the CommKtee on
Federal Relations requesting the Congres
sional delegation to work for an appropri
ation for the completion of the improve
ments at Humboldt Bay.
Cutter offered a resolution instructing
the sergeant-at-arms to purchase and the
Comptroller to pay out of the contingent
fund therefor $75 for rubber stamps for
uae of the Senators. Referred to the
Committee on Attaches.
A petition was presented from the Pres
byterian church of Chico requesting the
Senators and Assemblymen to enact a
Sabbath law.
When the Senate reconvened after the
joint convention Braunhart. speaking to
a question of privilege, denounced as un
true the insinuation of a San Francisco
paper that his bills limiting the pay of
court stenographers and reducing the
rate of interest are in the nature of
"cinch" measures.
The Senate then adjourned until 10 a. m.
Monday, the following bills having been
introduced during the day.
THE CHARTER WILL BE
CONSIDERED TUESDAY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14.â San Francisco's char
ter was this morning made the special
order in the Assembly for Tuesday morn
ing, immediately aiter the reading of the
journal. It was done upon motion of As
semblyman Cobb of San Francisco, and
finally removes that , precious document
beyond any slight danger there may have
been of its suffering by amendment at the
hands of the Judiciary Committee.
It was feared by the more nervous of
the friends of the document that Dib
ble's motion of yesterd*y to recall it from
the Committee on Municipal Corporations
and rereftr it to the Judiciary Commit
tee preceded an attempt to cut out certain
Motions objectionable to the San Fran
cisco push, but the truth is that, though
Dibble is said to have had some such in
tention, he was the only one of the com
mittee who had, and would not have been
strong enough to effect his plan. The
charter hats not been for a minute in any
actual jeopardy, and Dibble himself will
vote for it when it comes up for its final
reading and passage.
This howl of danger to it and these
pleas for eternal vigilance have been to
effect no other purpose than the spectacu
lar plan of advertising just now the one
idea of Mayor Jnmes D. Phelan. Does
there go out an announcement that the
charter is being considered and Mr. Phe
lan's daily issue blazons forth "Danger to
the charter," and Jamesy, with Eddie Fay
tagging along to see to the immaculate
polish of the Phelan shoes, and the bur
nishing of the Phelan tile, resumed since
election, hurries to the Capitol. It is a
clevor somersault before the grand stand,
but it has no excuse in reason. The ona
man in Sacramento who is out against
the charter is Martin Kelly, and Martin
Kelly has not a vote he can throw against
it. His political influence in the present
Legislature is a minus quantity, and the
good old has-been spends his time in
friendly tips that carry no weight and
harangues characteristic of the days
when he was an influence to be figured on
in things political.
At the earnest solicitation of Mr. Phe
lan he was accompanied to this city by
Hon. Charles L. Patton, and with Pres
ident Dohrman of the Merchants' Asso
ciation and Henry N. Clement, they ap
peared in the Assembly chamber this
morning, but departed after the Question
at interest had been disposed of until
Tuesday.
By the adoption of a resolution intro
duced by Blood of Calaveras, all City
and County Clerks in the State will here
after be provided with two copies each
of every bill relative to municipalities or
county government.
The Committee on Attaches, which held
an unimportant meeting last evening,
filed its report, in which it recommended
that all committee chairmen immediately
submit the names of their clerks that
they might be duly appointed.
Assemblyman Valentine was in the
chair during the greater part of the morn
ing, and at ten minutes after 10 he called
a recess until 11:45 o'clock, when the As
sembly reassembled and adopted a reso
lution providing that when the Assembly
adjourned for the day it should be until
11:30 o'clock Mondny morning 1 .
The joint Senatorial ballot was begun
at noon, ajid after four votes had been
taken the joint convention adjourned un
til Monday noon, and the Assembly to the
hour on Monday agreed upon earlier in
the day.
THREE IMPORTANT
BILLS INTRODUCED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14.â Assemblyman Meade of
Los AngeleÃ is out after the many and
| variegated so-called investment compa
| nies. The Western slope has for the past
j half a dozen years been a prolific field for
| about every catch-penny scheme that a
clever grafter can conceive, and few of
them have ever resulted in anything save
profit to the promoter. San Francisco
and Les Angeles particularly have been
successful fields of operation. Mutual
benefit associations have builded up
assets of thousands of dollars out of no
apparent capital, and although Califor
nia's code does not permit of preferred
stocks in its corporations, so-called pre
ferred stocks, thinly disguised, guaran
teeing ai< r where from 6 to 12 per cent
' per annum to any one who cares to put
i his saving* in them, have been unloaded
all over the Slat.-, ami every year ha>
its story to tell of one or more of the con
cerns going broke, its patrons with it.
It is these institutions that Assembly
man Meade is after, and the more reputa
ble class as well. Among the numerous
good bills he has already introduced is
one that he handed up to the clerk's desk
| this afternoon, which brings all of these
! associations under the class known as
building and loan associations, and makes
1 them amenable to the rules and regula
' tlona of the Building and Loan Cum
! mission.
The bill also hits a solar plexus blow
j at those building and loan association*
I whose methods are as questionable as
i their assets, in providing that any mcm
i ber or investor shall have the right to
I withdraw from the association upon
, thirty days' notice, and that if his mi
i vestment and accrued interest be not
paid within ninety days after formal no
tice is given, the corporation may issue
no more of its stock until such with
drawal is fully liquidated.
An association shall be insolvent when
its assets are less than the dues that have
| been paid in, and any insolvent associa
tion roust pare down the face of its stock
enough to offset its arrearages or go into
the bandi of a receiver. The provisions
i ol the lilll relating to insolvency are taken
! from the laws now In effect in New York,
j Illinois and Indiana.
Works of San Diego also introduced a
bill regulating the appointment of not
aries public. Under the present law the
only qualification necessary in an appli
cant for a notary's certificate is the sig
; natures of two citizens of standing In
his community. Under the law proposed
by Works, an applicant must undergo ex
amination by the Superior Judge of his
county and must have lived in the county
in which he makes application for a year
or more.
A bill, said to have bean drafted at the
request of associated labor, was intro
duced during the morning, and bids fair
to attract considerable attention before
it Is finally passed. It takes a iar step
forward for the betterment of the men
who am employed in factories, foundries
or in any business where stationary ma
chinery is used ;ind where the record of
1 injuries is necessarily a long one. By the
provisions of the act all employers are re
quired to provide for men injured while
on duty their surgical attention and
medicines and such other things as their
recovery may necessitate. The limit to
the -employer's liab.uty is fixed at three
months, and if he fails to do as the act
requires he shall be liable for damages
in three times the- amount expended by
the employe on his own account.
BULLA AND GRANT ARE
NOT THROWING BOUQUETS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA :
MENTO, Jan. 14.-Robert N. Bulla and
General W. H. L. Barnes were to-day tied
in the Senatorial contest. Each had nine
votes. Owing to the fact that Senator
Stratton of Alameda had returned to his
home. General Barnes' strength was di
minished by one vote. It will be with him
again on Monday. The Bullaites had their
dally caucus at 5 o'clock this afternoon,
and agreed to all stand together for Bulla
during the balloting Monday. As yet
there are no signs of any additional votes
coming to the Buila column.
As the days go by the entente cordiale
between the Grant and Bulla men be
comes more strained. The. winning over
of Assemblyman Huber by the Grant peo
ple has angered some of Bulla's friends,
and they are very bitter about it. Assem
blymen Valentine and Mellick. and possi
bly Conrey, will never vote for Grant
under any circumstances. Kut Senator
Simpson, Senator Currier and Assembly
man Miller can probably be prevailed
upon to do so should they ever leave
Bulla. This would give Grant four of the
eight votes from the Los Angeles delega
tion. Bulla is not voting just now, but
should his name ever be dropped he will
then be in a position to exercise his right
to vote, but he will never go to Grant. It
is asserted positively that under no cir
cumstances is there a vote in the Los
Angeles delegation for Burns, and this is
undoubtedly true. The Los Angeles Sen
ator or Assemblyman who casts his vote
for the Candelaria colonel is ready for tne
political undertaker, as far as his future
prospects in Los Angeles County are con
cerned. There are a number of Los An
geles politicians who desire Burns' elec
tion, but they can be named and told off
on the fingers of your two hands. Among
them might be named William E. Dunn,
ex-City Attorney; Frank P. Flint, United
States Attorney; H. Z. Osborne. United
States Marshal; "W. F. Parker, Governor
Henry T. Gage and his satellites. But
these parties 3o not cut any figure in the
Republican politics of their home county
any more. They cannot swing one vote
from Bulla to Burns, if Bulla retires from
the fight, save for a good round consid
eration.
The Grant men. on the other hand. arÂ«
very bitter against Bulla. They think
that if Grant could have tho eight votes
from Los Angeles County he would be
on the high road to an election. That
would give him only thirty-five votes, and
he would still be lacking twenty-six of the
required number. But as long as Bulla
remains in the fight Grant will not have
any more Los Angeles County votes than
he has to-day. The treacherous Huber
will probably stay with him to the end,
or at least until he sees fit to "do poli
tics" and make another switch. * lye
Grant supporters in Southern California
have announced that If they ever leave
Grant they intend to vote for Thomas R.
Bard of Ventura. They said that under
no circumstanCf-s will they go to Bulla.
Bard now has two votes. Senator Ches
ter Rowell of Fresno and Senator Thomas
Flint of San Benito are voting for Bard
just at present.
BULLA'S SUPPORTERS
WANT GRANT NEXT
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jnn. 14.â Thpre will be quite an
effort put forth by the friends of U. S.
Grant in Los Angeles during the next
few days to prevail upon the Los Angeles
delegation to drop Bulla out of the fight
and go over to Grant, on the ground that
by so doing they will probably insure the
election of a Southern California candl-,
date, or at least lend their aid to that
end. To-day a number of individual tele
grams were received by Bulla' s Los An
geles County supporters from parties who
were delegates to the last Republican
convention held in that county to the ef
fect that they believed that Bulla could
not be elected and that it was now time
for them to go to Grant. In addition to
the individual telegrams a general tele
gram extensively signed was received by
Senators Simpson and Currier. It fol
lows:
We, the undersigned delegates to the Re
publican county convention, believe that the
instructions to representatives to the Legis- i
lature to vote for R. N. Bulla have been car- I
ried out, and believing that he cannot bÂ« :
elected hereby request that you at once vote i
for U. S. Grant and thus elect a Southern Call
fornian United States Senator.

OAKLAND REPUBLICANS
REPUDIATE WRIGHT
OAKLAND, Jan. 14.â The Oakland
Times this morning published the fol
lowing:
CITIZENS TO REPUDIATE THE
ALAMEDA BURNS LEGISLATORS.
The sentiment in this community has
been so outraged at the possibility of
California being represented in the United
States Senate by a man of the character
of Dan Burns that steps have bec-n taken
to call a mass-meeting, to be held this
evening- t Exposition Hall, formerly
Mills Tabernacle, to express a popular
protest.
It is proposed to make this a big demon
stration of disapproval by the reputable
Republicans of Alameda County of the
action of those Senators and Assembly
men who voted for Burns. Prominent
speakers will be present and address the
meeting, and an effort will be made to
bring public sentiment to bear on the
legislators of this county, who, it is be
lieved, misrepresent their constituents.
The arrangements for the meeting have
not been completed yet, but Exposition
Hall, formerly Mills Tabernacle, has
been engaged for this evening.
The action of Speaker Wright in voting
for Burns has evoked a storm of protest
and it is proposed to make to-night's dem
onstration one that will leave no question
as to Alameda County sentiment.
The meeting was postponed owing to
the Municipal League Convention and
wet weather.
MARVIN HOLDS THE
RECORD AS SWITCHER
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14.â Assemblyman G. D.
Marvin of Humboldt County has the rec
ord for the week on changing his vote
in the Senatorial contest more frequently
than any of the hundred and twenty mem
bers of the Senate and Assembly who
have now given over the greater portiqn
of five days to thirteen fruitless ballots
in an attempt to elect a United States
Senator.
Assemblyman Marvin started out by
voting for George A. Knight. Then on
the second day he changed his vote to
Grant. On Thursday he made another
switch and voted for Charles N. Felton.
Friday he still remained true to ex-Sena
tor Felton, but to-day one more change
and again he cast his vote for Grant.
Assemblyman Marvin has made four
changes in live days and has voted for
three different candidates. Where he will
ultimately wind up it is hard to predict,
but the Grant men think h<s will now re
main with them.
-'it is nobody's business how T vote,"
said the Assemblyman from far off Hum
boldt, when questioned to-day as to who
his next choice would be. "I vote as I
see lit and as I believe my constituents
would like to have me vote and they are
the only people who have any right to
hold me accountable. Further than this,
I do not care to discuss this question at
all."
Mr. Marvin admitted that he thought
Grant was the choice of a good many of
his constituents, but not all of them. He
denied emphatically that he had been in
fluenced In switching his vote so often by
any consideration other than that of dis
charging his duty to his constituents as
he conceived it. The Grant men think
that Marvin will be with them when the
balloting is resumed Monday, but as a
matter of fact no one save Marvin him
self knows what camp he will be in when
his name is called for the fourteenth bal
lot.
DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL
TIMBER EXHAUSTED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14.â 0n the four ballots
taken to-day the Democrats exhausted
the Senatorial timber they had selected
to mark with the empty honor of their
thirty-three votes, save in one instance.
On the first ballot on Monday they will
vote for Hon. Abbott Kinney of Los An
geles. No caucus has yet been officially
called to select Democrats to be voted for
on the other ballots which will probably
be taken during the day, but it Is under
stood that a meeting will be held early
on Monday morning to make a selection
for five more ballots. Senator Feeney
continues to vote for John Rosenfeid and
Utterly ignores the action of the Demo
cratic caucus. On some of the ballots
Senator Hall joins him, but not often
The Democrats are growing weary' of
the deadlock, but thus far there seems to
be no general sentiment among the mi
nority members in favor of interfering
The majority of the Democrats seem to
favor the idea that the Republicans
should settle their own family
fight. There are some Democrat? how
ever, who do not feel this way and who
are ready at any time to offset the votes
of any Democratic members who may be
unduly influenced to vote for a Republi
can. This fact is known to the Burns
push, and it is not pleasant information
to them.
THE FIRST WAVE OF
ECONOMICAL LEGISLATION
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14. -This Legislature of 1599
has come to the Capitol pledged to econ
omy in the fullest and against the multi
tude of commissions that have flourished
for years for no other purpose than the
spending of their appropriations.
The light was begun this morning in the
Assembly, when Grove L. Johnson of Sac

the Committee on Commissions and Pub
lic Expenditures to begin an investiÃcUion
into every commission with offices at the
Capitol and elsewhere and to report as

THE TAX COLLECTION
LAW IS LEGAL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 14.â A letter received by
Governor Gage knocks the bottom out of
the scheme planned by San Francisco and
Sacramento lawyers to collect on behalf
of forty-two counties of this State large
sums on the settlement of State taxes.
It was roughly estimated that $1,500,000
was due the variois counties as commis
sions for the collection of State taxes.
The claim was put forward by tho law
yers in the scheme that the bill in the
Legislature of ISS3 repealing the act which,
allowed commissions to the counties for
the collection of State taxes did not re
ceive a constitutional majority in the
Senate. The records of the Senate were
cited to prove that only twenty Senators
voted for the repealing act. ' Senator
Campbell's name was not recorded as
voting.
Contracts were therefore made between
the attorneys and the Boards of Super
visors by which Devlin & Devlin of this
city and Slack, Rodgers & Paterson of
San Francisco were to receive from 25 to
40 per cent of all the money collected from
the State.
The Call thoroughly exposed the
scheme, showing conclusively that if
M, 500,000 wus taken from the State treas
u"> to reimburse the counile.3 .for com
missions under : the old law, tlic Sta'e
v.o'iid be compelled to levy a tax on the
various ccrnties to 'make good the sura
B'i taken Iroin the treasury. Tho tax
payers would therefore losr> all that â was
gained from the State, and in addition
be- compelled to pay nearly a haif ir.iliiou
dollars. to the lawyers.
There is no longer a doubt th.it the law
Vv ii3 passed in a constitut'oual manner.
Senator Orr.pbell has written the follow
ing letter to the Governor:
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9, 1899.
His Excellency. Governor Henry T.
Gage, Sacramentoâ Dear Sir: Referring
to the repeal of the law in 1893 allowing
county officers a commission for collect
ing the State's portion of taxes I wish to

or typographical error my name, which
should appear as voting aye on the .final
passage. was omitttÂ»d in the printed pro

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, j an 14.â Several gentlemen came
from the city to-day with the intention of
saving the San Francisco charter. It was
a noble mission. The charter was in no
; r than the constitution of the
United States, but they came just the
same. No Don Quixote charging a wind
mill over displayed a courage more reck
less. As a matter of fact there is abso
lutely no opposition to the charter here.
The only man known to entertain hostile
feedings toward it is Martin Kelly, and
what feelings he may entertain toward
the charter or anything else are of very
. â  little consequence. t
The party embraces Mayor Phelan and '
rs. Fay. Dohrmar.n, Patton and !
Boyd. As Phelan has been here before
and knows the lay of the land, there does
â  hot seem to be any good excuse for him. :
but the others may be excused. Fay does |
not count, and Dohrmann, as head of the
Merchants' Association, is ever ready to
defend the public interests. Ail but Phe
lan have been led astray by a false alarm,
and as for Phelan, he turned in the
alarm. Nevertheless he has a mission. He
has had the complimentary vote of the
Joint session once, and he wants it not
.pn . but all the time. No confi
dence is violated in saying that he will not
get it. There are other Democrats to be
remembered. W. W. Foote has not yet j
had a vote. At times when the joint ses-
Bion adjourned it has been supposed to
be for the reason that the Democrats
were unable to find suitable material upon
which to waste their sweetness. Why
Should Phelan and Tarpey, Maguire and
Hamilton and the rest who are not pos-
Bibilities nor activities be placed ahead of
Mr. Foote? I simply ask the question.
Nevertheless the gentlemen are welcome

is becoming trite, but there seems to be

A STATE BUILDING FOR
SAN FRANCISCO
CAXL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
JIEXTO, Jan. 14.â Senator Braunhart has
.Jijtroduced a bill in the Senate pro
â  viding for the purchase or lease of a site
and the erection of a State building in
â¢â " San Francisco. The bill is identical in its
.... provisions with that introduced by him
.' at the last session and which passed the
. â¢ -Senate, but died on the Assembly files.
â¢â¢â â¢ â  The: bill appropriates $300,000 for the
purchase of a site and the erection of the
building, half of the appropriation to be
available during the fifty-first fiscal year
and half during the fifty-second fiscal
year. The Governor is empowered to ap
polnt a commission of three members
â  who shall serve without compf-nsation.
but shall be allowed adequate contingent
expenses. They shall be allowed to ap
point a secretary at a salary of $1500 a
. The life of the commission Is lim
ited to four years.
The commission Is authorized to select
.-a site in a convenient location in San
Francisco and acquire title to it by pur
chase or condemnation proceedings. On
this site Is to be erected a building for
the accommodation of the Supreme Court,
; the Supreme Court Commissioners, Rall
roa/1 Commission, Bureau of Labor Sta-

The record of the ballots is given eise
â¢where. It does not indicate much to the
casual observer, but to one who has had
the boasts of the Burns crowd d'.nned into
his ears it means considerable. To-day
they were going to make a grain, they j
were going to show Just an inkling of
that mighty reserve strength with which
it is their purpose tr> sweep the field when
they get ready. Why this delay? There
never was a better time to do the sweep
ing than right now. The truth is, they :
had built their hopes on the defection of !
Knights from Barries, and when it proved j
to be ix defection with a fatal defect a
i sorrow fell upon them. It is as I said yes
terday. Burns has no show. His disciples
i are whistling in a graveyard. Their pre
tensions :ire born of a groundless yearn
ing. If they possessed the strength of
which they hrag that strength would have
! been in evidence before this. Even if a
few members feel inclined to go over to
'â  him, they lack the courage, and they are
beginning to realize that there would be
;ior and scant profit in getting under
the banners of the defeated. There is
â  such a thing as honorable defeat, but this
is not the variety in store for Burns.
The other candidates are so glad to see
Burns on the shelf tht for the moment
they forget that there Is only one place
for several aspirants and that nobody has
a mortgage on that place. The Grant
men made a gain of one vote, for. while
the total looked the same, it embraced
Marvin, and Marvin had been voting for
I Knight or Felton. The circumstance that
a Grant man was absent had no real
effect on ultimate results, although his
presence would have pleasingly fattened
the column.
To cling to a forlorn hope may be com
mendable, but I do not think Scott, Ros
enfeld. Bard, Knight, Paterson, Felton
or Estee represent even a forlorn hope.
On the contrary, they represent a series
of bluffs, and the men voting for them
will vote for another.
The minute the band wagon comes into '
sight they will scramble for a place and !
try to get the front seat. Barnes and !
Bulla are different. Each has a following
and each separately may be regarded as
a factor in the situation.
Wright still votes for Burns. The shame
of surrender seems to be wearing off. To
day he pronounced the name of his mas
ter audibly. In his case, taken with that
of Knights, there is opportunity for an in
teresting comparison. The men were sub
jected to the same pressure. All the
powers of the great political machine, of
the railroad and the State Central Com
mittee, were brought to bear upon them.
Wright yielded, forfeited the respect of
his fellow-men, the support of his con
stituency and the right to hold up his
head as an independent citizen and a good
Republican.
Knights refused to be bulldozed. He
listened 10 arguments, and finding them
specious declined to be convinced. He
heard threats and had the courage to
defy them. In consequence he has re
tained respect and made countless friends.
He could ask of the people of tois State
favors which they would be glad to
grant. If he holds out against Burns
he will be remembered to his advantage.
If he surrenders he will be remembered,
but as a person not to be trusted, and he '
will yet be subjected to every inducement j
cunning politicians can devise. Th-2 ]
Burns gang have not given him up.
To-morrow being Sunday there will be
no practical politics. Men will simply
meet and talk matters over, debate the
qualifications of the various candidates,
line up at the bar, button-hole, villify,

WORKS WANTS TO RELIEVE

FRENCH LADY LAWYERS.
In Paris there are no obstacles in the
way of a lady studying with a view to

that after she has been called, and she
desires to turn her studies to profitable
account, her troubles begin. A large
number of barristers are not in favor of
lady advocates, but It seems that a com
mission which lately sat to discuss the
subject has pronounced in favor of the
ladles. And It is this decision which is
causing emotion at the Palais de Justice
just now. The prospect of lady barris

MEAT BILL SATISFACTORY
NO STRAIN CAUSED BY NEW
POSSESSIONS IN PACIFIC.
Berlin Newspapers Declare That In
spection. Concessions Will Not
Be Made to the
United States.
Copyrighted, 1393. by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Jan. 14.â The United States
Embassador, Andrew D. White, said
to the correspondent of the Associated
Press to-day for publication:
"Our relations with Germany are
thoroughly good and are steadily im
proving. _ I look to the proposed meat
inspection as a step calculated to help
rather than hurt us. What thinking
men on each side wish to secure is a
single inspection which will be valid
throughout the empire and supersede
the various local inspections which are
often prompted by a panic arising from
isolated trichinae cases, justly or un
justly attributed to foreign meats. We
have been laboring to obtain this in
spection for a long time and now have
strong hopes of a successful issue.
There are unreasonable men on both
sides of the Atlantic, but we believe the
reasonable men here and in America
are in the majority and they are more
and more understanding the import
ance of good relations between the two
countries.
"Regarding the question of acquisi
tions in the Pacific and elsewhere the
feeling of the two governments is ex
cellent. The German Foreign Office
shows every desire that this state of
things should continue and the German
officials in every way work in harmony
with us. In the Pacific as elsewhere
there is not the slightest cause at pres
ent for the slightest ill-feeling arising
out of the ambitions of either power
and all questions are being steadily
placed on a better footing."
The Bundesrath considered the meat
inspection bill this week, and the favor
able view taken of the measure by the
American Embassador is contrasted by
the fact that the Agrarian press this
week very severely criticised the bill.
The Deutsche Tagezeitung, comment
ing upon the Cologne Gazette's discus
sion of the bill on January 9, when that
paper took the ground that the measure
would be in no way detrimental, but
rather advantageous to American meat,
describes the measures "unheard of
groveling before the United States,"
and predicts that the Reichstag will
not confirm such a bill.
The Deutsche Agrar Correspondenez,
which, as the organ of the Federation
of Husbandry, recently fiercely at
tacked the scientific attache of the
American embassy for having in the
German press disposed of false state
ments set afloat by that body, goes even
further than the Tagezeitung, heaping
abuse upon those who are responsible
for framing the bill and on the meas
ure itself, declaring it is utterly impos
sible for the Reichstag majority to in
dorse some of the essential provisions of
the bill, especially the one delegating
to the Bundesrath its own powers of
prohibition.
On the other hand, the Liberal press
joyfully welcomes the moderate provi
sions of the bill. The Vossische Zeltung
says: "If the Agrarians had their own
way Germany ere this would have been
in the throes of a tariff war with the
whole worldâ England, Russia, Argen
tine and every agricultural and export
ing country."

DEATH CUT SHORT
HIS WEARY FLIGHT
Dawson Prisoner Escapes and
Eludes Pursuers, Only to
Succumb to the Cold.
VICTORIA", B. C, Jan. 14.â News of a strange tragedy, which oc
curred about the middle of December along the Yukon banks, and the
details of which would supply the plot for a story like those of Bret
Harte, was brought by men who reached here this morning by the
steamer Amur from Dawson.
On December 9, while an American named O'Brien, who was sen
tenced to imprisonment for one month for drunkenness, was engaged
at work with the chain gang near the Gold Commissioner's office at
Dawson, he suddenly took advantage of the negligence of his guard to
make a break for liberty. It was not until night had fallen that his
disappearance was discovered, and then the fugitive, having had a
good start, had covered a considerable distance up the river on his
way to American territory and freedom. The pursuit was not begun
until three hours after O'Brien's escape, and, saving his fellow-prison
ers, none knew of his escape until the assembly call sounded at the
barracks, and the pursuers " dashed over the ice after the fleeing
American.
Two constables went after him, Constables Macleth and Kelly.
They had a fast dog team, and for a night the chase continued. The
breaking down of the constables' sled further aided the fleein^ man,
and it was not until when within but a few miles from the boundary
that the pursuers came upon what had been their prisoner, but what
was now a firmly frozen corpse.
The prisoner had been overtaken by the cold and fell asleep in a
bed of jagged snow and ice, sleeping till death came to him.
Rhenish paper is correctly informed,
the bill will not be approved by the
Agrarians, for the Tageblatt addr the
latter declare they intend to have it
framed so as to prevent . merican im
ports. This causes the Tageblatt to
say: "It would be an enjoyable symp
tom if the Government began to show a
little more backbone toward the Agra
rians."
Official statistics of German exports
to the United States show that they
amounted during the last quarter in
the northern half of Germany, exclud
ing the Zittlau consulate, to $12,503,161,
compared with $9,024,9-17 in 1897. In the
southern half of Germany the exports
to the United States amounted to $8,
--815,189, being an increase of $626,539. The
total increase for the past quarter
amounted to about $5,000,000, mainli
ne to sugar exports, which came to
a standstill during the last quarter of
1898. The total exports for 1898, how
ever, show a decrease when compared
with those of 1897. This also is mainly
traceable to sugar, which from the
Brunswick consulate alone the exports
diminished over $2,500,000.
The semi-official Berlin Post sum
marizing Germany's export trade for
1898, says referring to the United States
that excepting in the one item of sugar
Germany's exports were not nearly so
poor as it was at first feared they
would be.
A strong movement in favor of a pro
tective tariff has been set on foot by
the horticulturists of Germany. A meet
ing of over 1000 of them has addressed
a strongly worded petition to the im
perial government, reciting their rea
sons for demanding protection. The
Minister of the Interior, Count yon
Posadowski-Wehner, â  has summoned
the president of the organization to
furnish him with additional informa
tion on the subject and there is reason
to believe the Government intends to
frame a tariff measure which will meet
the horticulturists' views.
A sensational high treason trial has
been fixed for next month before the
Supreme Court of Leipsig. The pris
oner, a Pole named Goldhumer, claim
ing to be a dealer in precious stones,
was arrested at Metz on his arrival
there from Paris. It is said the evi
dence collected directly implicates a
number of higher government and mili
tary officers in France. Some stir has
been created by the fact that the Gov
ernment organs, the North German Ga
zette, the Kreuz Zeitung and other in
spired journals this week have pub
lished editorials representing that the
two years' military service system
adopted in 1895 has not proved a suc
cess.
How Sound Is Carried.
From a high ridge in Berkshire there is
occasionally to be heard the sound of the
firing of guns of Aldershot, thirty miles
to the eastward. These guns are chiefly
noticed in the summer time, when there
is very rarely an east wind to help the
sound. Occasionally the reports are mis
taken for distant thunder, and thus cause
alarm at a time when hay harvest is in
progress. There is. however, a saying in
the district that the "guns are worse than
thunder," and this because they forecast,
not a passing or local .Â«torm. but rather
the approach of generally unsettled
weather. It is easy to prove that it Is
a continuity of a uniform moisture-laden
air stretching acrops that part of the
country that is the cause of the phenome
non. The testimony of seamen and other
trained observers goes to show that ho
mogeneous moist air or mist is the readi
est vehicle of sound; that dry air seldom
or never conveys sound so readily, while
an atmosphere of varying density ren
ders all sound capricious.
From a sheltered, quiet lawn the Aider
shot guns had not been noticed all
through the late summer until far on in
one afternoon in the middle of August,
when their sound rolled out with great
distinctness, the woather, to all appear
ance, remaining unchanged and the ba
rometer standing firm and high. In the
night, however, thunder was heard for
some two hours, the lirst time for many
weeks, and in the morning the guns were
heard again more distinctly than before.
In this case sound has been the clearest,
and indeed the only telltal* of a humid
layer of the atmosphere brooding over
the countryside.â The Contemporary Re

PARIS, Jan. 14. â Rumors of a coup
d'etat are in the air, and Premier Du
puy's declaration in the Chamber on
Thursday that the army would not fol
low the Savior, whose coming Paul de
Cassaignac prophesied, has not suf
ficed to dispel them.
The reports have taken different form
from those prevalent a month ago.
Then the fate of the republic was said
to be in the hands of certain generals
who were somewhat roughly used over
the Dreyfus case.
Now Brussels is the danger point.
The royalists appear to favor an im
perialist reaction. They seem, to think
that Prince Victor has a much better
chance of overthrowing the republic
than the Duke of Orleans.
Prince Victor has been biding his
time and opportunity, while Philippe
d'Orleans has burned his powder use
lessly in a manifesto which fell very
flat some months ago. The Napoleonic
pretender has a good card in his
younger brother, Louis, who will soon
have a general's rank in the Russian
army.
Paul de Cassaignac is not the only
one predicting another Napoleonic
throne within a month or so. Others
say not till the "affaire" is settled.
Major Count Esterhazy has sent to
M. Mazeau, President of the Court of
Cassation, a synopsis of the evidence
which he says he would have given at
the Dreyfus revision inquiry if a safe
conduct had been granted him. He ad
mits his relations during 1594-95 at the
request of Colonel Sandherr, chief of
the Information Bureau, with a foreign
agent, by which the count claims he
supplied the colonel with important in
formation, "enabling him to combat
the intrigues of an individual well
known, but whose position was made
unsafe to act openly against him."
Esterhazy adds that he was warned
a month ahead of Matthew Dreyfus'
intention and denounced it at the in
stigation of Colonel Picquart. Subse
quent to this he had the closest rela
tions with his superiors and acted
throughout on their instructions until
January 7, IS9B, when, he claims, the
War Ministry suddenly assumed a hos
tile attitude toward him.
Fresh proceedings, the Count asserts,
were instituted at the â¢ -~H <*ation of his
cousin, with the view of getting him
out of the way and preventing him
from testifying before the Court of
Cassation.
In conclusion Esterhazy says:
"Alone, exiled, abandoned by those
who should have defended me, I have
resisted the most tempting offers and
have refused to say or write a word
against my chiefs. I hope the pain will
be spared me of having to appeal to the
tribunal of public opinion from the de
cision of the Court of Cassation."

TO CHECK THE
OPIUM TRAFFIC
Prison Directors Con-
sider the Situation.
APPEAL TO THE LEGISLATURE
WILL ASK FOR THE PASSAGE Off
A SUITABLE BILL.
How Guards Cramer and Brooks
Were Detected in the Act of
Smuggling in the
Drug.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Jan. 14.â
Opium smuggling and measures to pre
vent it constituted the principal topio
of discussion at the monthly meeting of
the Board of Prison Directors to-day.
Besides the consideration of a number
of cases the vigilance of the guards de
tected throughout the month, it waa
agreed to ask the Legislature to pass a.
law making the offense of bringing the
drug upon the grounds a felony.
Collaterally the board took up ths
case of Guards Cramer and Brooks,
who were discharged last month for
alleged complicity in the contraband
trade. A convict gave the officials the
tip which led to the discovery and the
facts came out on the examination of
J. J. McCanthy for the same offense.
McCanthy is serving a ten years' sen
tence from Los Angeles County for bur
glary and is alleged to be the man for
whom Cramer and Brooks were ob
taining the drug. He denies this, how
ever, and maintains that he knows
neither.
According to the statements of tha
officials before the board it appears
that C. H. Miller, a two-year man,
serving a sentence for forgery com
mitted in San Joaquin, supplied the
bulk of the information. Miller claims
he was approached by McCanthy and
requested to carry letters to Brooks.
At first he declined, but after consult
ing Captain of the Guard Birlem en
tered into the scheme. The letters
â were written in cipher. Miller took the
leters to Birlem, who, after making a
translation, returned them and directed
him to deliver them to Brooks. There
were some ten letters, all relating to the
purchasing of opium and several con
taining money. A close watch was
kept on these men. Shortly following
the receipt of a letter containing the
necessary funds to purchase the
"dope" Cramer was seen to walk down
the wall to Brooks' post and hand him
a package. Cramer returned from San
Francisco that morning. About an
hour later Brooks lowered a water
bucket from the wall at a prearranged
time with Miller, who waa there osten-Â«
sibly to fill it.
In the bucket which was lowered a
two-pound package of opium was
found. Miller slipped it into his pocket,
filled the bucket for Brooks, and then
hastened to Victor Gilardin, keeper of
the lower gate and reported the facts.
Warden Hale dismissed Brooks and
Cramer. upon this showing without call
ing for an explanation. McCanthy, the
convict, stated to the board that Miller
was an enemy of his and that this
charge had been concocted for revenge.
The directors regarded the matter in
another light, however, and deprived
McCanthy of all his credits.
The constant use of opium â¢by the
convicts, which the officials apparently
cannot pre%'ent, has led Warden Hale
to draft a bill making it a felony to
bring that drug or any other narcotic
upon the grounds. He submitted the
matter to the board. The draft did
not quite meet the views of the di
rectors, so Devlin and Fitzgerald were
appointed a committee to draw up a
bill which shall meet the requirements.
At the same time the warden was au
thorized to go to Sacramento and urge
Its passage before the Legislature.
Leon Crosmond, who is serving two
years for burglary, from Yuba County,
was ordered released on parole, as was
Claude Armstrong.
Pretty French Sentimentality.
The Jour, which is 'one of the loudest
and most influential of latter day French
newspapers, published on November 13 a
paragraph on a duel which a member of
its staff had fought with a lawyer named
M. Morel, and the terms employed by that
journal throw a curious side light upon
the chivalry of some of the writing and
flÃhtinp classes in France: "We have itad
the happiness to learn that the wound re
ceived yesterday by Lawyer Morel is more
serious than was supposed at first. Con
sidering that it is complicated with a bad
disease, there are good grounds for hoping
that this wound will have serious conse
quences."âContemporary Review.

Common sense teaches that a man should'
not over-work or over-worry; that he should
take ample time ' for his meals, for resting" :
and for recreation and sleep: that he should
not neglect the little ills of life, because
they are the precursors of serious and fatal
maladies.' Chemistry has enabled men to
make combinations of drugs that were im-
possible in the days of the alchemists. .
Medical science has taught when, how and
why these combinations of drugs should
be used. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis-
covery is the most valuable of- all health-
restoring medicines, and the most effective.
Its first work is upon the fountain-head of
life â the stomach. A man who has a weak
and impaired stomach and who does not
properly, digest his food will soon find that
his blood has become weak and impover-
ished, and that his whole body is improp-
erly and insufficiently nourished. This,,
medicine makes the stomach strong, facil-
itates the flow of digestive juices, restores
the lost appetite, makes assimilation, per-
fect, invigorates the liver and purifies and
enriches the blood. It is the ; great blood-
maker, flesh-builder and nerve tonic. It
makes men strong in body, active in mind
and cool in judgment.
It does not make flabby fat, but solid,

: Business men in^ the United States
who contemplate making investments

If they are rightly informed of condi
tions here. The population of Luzon
Island, the largest and most important
in the group, is generally estimated at
3,000,000-. Some good authorities put it
as high as 4,000,000. A high, rugged
range of mountains forms the eastern
coast line. Another range extends
along the western coast. These mount
ain ranges are thinly populated by half
savages, and the gravelly soil and
cloudy climate there are not adapted to
cane, coffee, tobacco, or rice, the staples
of the islands. The main part of the
population ie. therefore, confined to
. river valleys and the low lands adjoin
. ing the coast. The population is con
gested in villages and settlements of
fifty to 5000 huts, or nipas, in each set
tlement.
Outside of Manila there is no settle
ment in the Philippine group that de
ierves to be called a town. The native
huts bunched together anywhere off
Manila Bay are put there without
order or system, with narrow trails
winding circuitously through mud as
the only streets. Occasionally there is
a large cathedral and perhaps three or
four other buildings connected with it,
of Moorish architecture, some of them
phore than 100 years old, and all more
or less dilapidated, which present a
strange contrast to the squalor and
poverty of the hundreds or thousands
of surrounding nipas.

of the Chinese. A rice patch of a half
acre is a pretty good sized farm for one
man. Three crops are harvested each
year. The rice lands are not as a rule
owned by the coolies who cultivate
thorn, but the rich Chinese half-castes
who lease the tract, usually on shares.
There are some large plantations of
1000 to 10,000 acres managed by over-
Feors. These plantations are devoted
to the production of tobacco, sugar
cane and the plant from which the hemp
fiber is taken. The monks and Spanish
officials were the plantation owners un

of laborers were paid :!0 to -3 cents a
day, Mexican money, equal to 10 or 12
cente gold. The laborers were obliged
to board themselves. The plantation
Bystem, however, is rapidly passing
through a renovation since the Ameri
can occupation. The nionka are dispos
ing Of iheir"lands as fast as'they can,
and will probably succeed in selling all
their holdings to one or more English
syndicates. A Boston syndicate also is
represented here, negotiating for the
purchase of hemp plantations.
.plovers of labor complain that the
American occupation has caused a
doubling and trebling of Wfcgefl on
plantations and elsewhere. Admiral
Dewey began paying the natives $1 50
a day for Government work imme
.iiat.lv after the destruction of Mon
tejo's fleet and has kept up that scale,
Chinese and Filipino laborers, who for
merly worked for $5 to $S Mexican
per month, will not turn a hand for
less than 51 a day Mexican. Plantation
laborers are being contracted for at 50
3 a day. The consequence will be
a rise in the price of raw hemp, sugar
and tobacco, unless more intelligent
management and improved machinery
serve to equalize the increased cost of
labor.
Coal mines are being worked in the
southern part of Luzon Island and on
the island of, Oebu, but the coal is soft
and far inferior to the Australian and
Japanese varieties. Prior to the break
ing out of the war Cebu coal was deliv
ered at the coast In large quantities at
$3 f,O a ton Mexican, but was consumed
mainly by the interisland steamers.
The price under new conditions is prob
lematical. Surveys indicate that the
coal beds are In scattered localities be
tween the ( ighth and thirteenth paral
lels of latitude. An English syndicate,
with headquarters in Manila, owns
practically all the coal lands known on
the islands of Luzon and Cebu. For
fhat matter English capital controls
nine-tenth* of all the industrial enter
prises in the group.
Good opportunities seem to be abun
dant for dealing in hardwoods. The
islands are dense with the choicest of
mahogany, iron wood, camphor wood
anrkinany other varieties of hardwoods.

This is not a fruit or vegetable coun
try. The climate is too hot and damp
for their cultivation. Bananas grow
well, but they are small and taste flat
and pasty. The Philippine orange is
two inches or so in diameter. The fiber
is coarse, the peeling thick and the
juice has a flavor much like spoiled
vinegar seeped through sawdust.
The coffee industry has never bepn
developed to any extent. Europeans
who have tried it declare that coffee

currents of air.
But a, supreme consideration to be
kepi in mind by intending investors is
the enervating influence of the climate.
Here, in Luzon, the climatic conditions
are more favorable than in the south
ern islands. The thermometer is rarely
. 80 degrees, and generally above
80. The high humidity of the atmo
sphere increases the oppressiveness of
the heat, and ultimately brings on a
languor and indolence that render men,

AGUINALDO
IS GROWING
MORE BOLD
His Army Is Massed Around the City of
Manila, and It Seems Difficult to
Avoid Hostilities.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, ISM, by James Gordon Bennett.
MANILA. Jan. 14. â The American troops will re
main at Uoilo. The Indiana will take down 200 tons of
provisions and a full cargo of coal. General Miller is await
ing orders as to landing. The natives are still hostile to the
Americans, owing to the attitude at Iliolo, of General Agui
naldo's party.
Last night two natives attacked and wounded a sen
try of the South Dakota Regiment, who bayoneted one and
shot the other.
The situation is difficult. Aguinaldo is massing his
troops around Manila. It is estimated that they number
forty thousand. He has many secret allies inside Manila.
The conference between General Otis and Aguinaldo's representatives has produced no
good result so far as has been reported. It seems difficult to avoid hostilities. Aguinaldo,
emboldened by the vacillating policy of the Americans, will not listen to a reasonable solu
tion of the question, and his army is strong enough to dominate public opinion. Twelve
thousand natives have left Manila. Seven extra trains carried many out of the city yester-
day and thousands are leaving by the roads.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 14.
The War Department will not make
public the text of the message received
from General Otis this morning-, but it
is similar in character to the one given
to the press several days ago, in which
he told of improved conditions.
General Otis said that the conditions
were improving, and that he was well
satisfied with the situation. There waa
nothing in the message-about a mutiny
among United States troops.-
The statement from Madrid that
American- troops were disaffected and
were deserting and threatening to
mutiny was absolutely denied at the
War Department to-day. On the con
trary, the spirit of the soldiers is re
ported as excejlent and the men are
anxious to fight the Filipinos.
General Otis' dispatch shows, it was
asserted, that since it became evident
there would be an open rupture with
Agulnaldo' and his insurgents the ma
jority of the American soldiers who had
applied for discharge or to be mustered
out have withdrawn their applications
and informed their officers that they
will remain in the ! sSrvice until \he last
vestige of opposition to this Govern
ment has been wiped out. either by
j peaceful methods or hy fire and sword.
Instead of being dissatisfied the trocrps
are enthusiastic and filled with patriot
ism. : >7.- ; '
It was denied at the War Department
that General Miller and his forces had
been ordered to abandon Iloilo and re
turn to Manila. Had^such a step been
taken General Otis would have men
tioned it in his cablegram to-day.
"You can say," said an army officer,
"that the American soldiers in the
Philippines are not disheartened and
anxious to return home. There is a
prospect of fighting, and that in itself
is enough to destroy all germs of nos
talgia." â 
HOAR'S RESOLUTION FOR
FILIPINO INDEPENDENCE
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â At the open-
Ing of the Senate's session to-day the
blind chaplain paid a tribute to the late
Nelson Dingley.
A letter was presented from Frye of
Maine, president pro tempore, appointing
Gallinger of New Hampshire to presido
over the Senate In the absence of the
Vice President and himself.
Proctor of Vermont Introduced a joint
resolution providing for busts of the late
Senator Merrill and Senator Voorhees to
be placed in the National Library. The
resolution was referred to the .Library
Committee.
Huar introduced the following resolu
tion:
"Resolved, That the people of the
Philippine Islands of right ocght to be
free and independent; that they are ab-
Bolved from all allegiance to the Span
i.-h crown, and that all the political
connection between them and Spain is
and ought to be totally dissolved, and
they they have, therefore, full power
to "do all act* and things which inde
pendent states may of right do; that it
is their right to institute a new govern
ment for themselves, laying a founda
tion on such principles and organizing
its power in such form as shall seem
most likely to effect their safety and
happiness, and that with these rights
the people of the United States are not
disposed to interfere."
"1 should like to have It adopted im
mediately," said Hoar.
"I object," said Davis of Minnesota,
chairman of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, and the resolution went over.
The resolution of Allen for the appoint
ment of a committee of five Senators to
Investigate the conduct of the late war
was laid before the Senate, and Allen took
the floor.
Allen said he had no de3lre to embarrass
the President, but so many complaints
had been ;uode by the press and individu
als of the conduct of the war that he
thought it time for a rigid and impartial
investigation of the war to be made. He
had, he said, no confidence in the "Alger
Relief Commission," which was not con
ducting an investigation of the war. He
criticized the sending of troops to Chicka
mauga, where they were faced by sick
ness and death. He intimated that the
troops of .the West were sent to Chlcka
mauga for the benefit of transportation
companies. He declared that there had
been gross irregularities in the handling
of llic commissary and other supplies.
He said it had been charged that the sup
plies were In many cases unfit for use,
and he was satisfied the churges were
tru<' If the troops had been furnished
'emijalmed beef, 1 ' the people and the,
world bad a right to know it.
Interrupting Air. Allen, Spooner of Wis
consin criticized him for his anticipation
of an unfair and partial report from the
commission nivl suggested that he might
better wait until the report was presented
before he attacked it.
At this point a message was received
from the House announcing the adoption
of resolutions on the death of Representa
tive IMngley.
Hale requested that the resolution be
laid before the Senate and read.
Hule then offered resolutions expressive
of the deep sensibility with which the
Senate had learned of the death of Rep
resentative Dingley and directed the ap
pointment of a committee of Senators to
accompany the remains to Maine.
II:ile also delivered a feeling eulogy of
DlngU-y.
The Senate then adjourned.

MAY GIVE THEIR
INDEPENDENCE TO
THE FILIPINOS
The President Wants Advice,
but if They Can Govern Them=
selves They Will Be Free.
NEW YORK, Jan. 14. â The Herald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: President McKinley has decided to send a commission to the Phil
ippines to make a thorough study of the situation and advise him as to
â what the policy of the United States should be regarding those islands.
He has asked those gentlemen to serve on the commission: Rear Ad
miral George Dewey, eonimander-in-chief of the Asiatic squadron; Major
General E. S. Otis, Military Governor of the Philippines; Professor J. G.
Schurman, president of Cornell University; Colonel Charles Denby, former
Minister to China, and now member of the War Investigation Commission,
and Brigadier General Charles B. Whittier of New York, recently on duty
at Manila. â¢
Admiral Dewey will be president of the commission. It is now only a
question as to whether or not the gentlemen named will consent to serve
and as to the date when the commission will start for the Philippines.
The fact that Professor Schurman has been summoned to Washington
to confer with the President indicates that Mr. McKinley contemplates
appointing the commission immediately, though there is a probability that
he may wait for the ratification of the peace treaty.
The President desires not only Professor Schurman's views regarding
the future attitude of this country toward the Philippines, but his advice as
to the phases of the question that ought to be considered by the commission.
Should he consent to serve there will be little difficulty in making up the
rest of the personnel of the commission, as all of the other men named are
thoroughly familiar with and interested in the subject and will doubtless
be glad to accept service.
President McKinley is not averse to the Filipinos having independence
if It can be proven that they are capable of maintaining sovereignty and
control of the Philippines permanently, but he wants to be sure of his
ground before taking any definite stand.
present commanding the San Francisco,

States Government toward them in pre

the acquisition of Porto Rico.
SENATOR FORAKER'S SPEECH
ALARMED THE ENGLISH
LONDON, Jan. 14.â When the Amer
can correspondents succeeded in im
pressing upon the British mind that
Senator Foraker, in his recent speech in
the United States Senate, spoke only
for himself when he suggested that the
United States might eventually with
draw from the Philippines, a distinct
sigh of relief might have been read be
tween the lines of the newspapers.
Every one here assumed that because
the Senator was from the President's
State he spoke for the President, and
the declaration made not only succeed
ed in giving British public officialdom
an unpleasant shock, but it fell like a
dash of cold water on the ardor of the
British for an Anglo-American under
standing. They began to question what
was the profit of this friendship if
America did not propose to back up
Great Britain's policy in the Far East'
by retaining the most important base
of operations in the event of war over
China.
The Incident has illustrated how
deeply the late war has left the United
States entangled in the world's policies,
for one of the foremost arguments ad
vanced against Senator Foraker's sug
gestion was that the United States
owed it to the world not to disturb the
balance of power, and not to furnish a
possible subject for war by throwing
the Philippines into the field, to be
scrambled for by the colonizing nations.
The leading editorial writers fell to
proclaiming most strenuously that
America's duty to the world at large
as well as the Filipinos should con
strain her to establish civilization, and
throughout the British press and in the
clubrooms and streets only one voice
was heard. The principle of the con
sent of the governed, all contended,
does not apply to people who are in
capable of forming a rational opinion
upon which to base their consent, and
that the United States stood in the
place of parents of the Filipinos and
must regretfully chastise her rebellious
children for their own good. Many
drew a parallel from the so-called co
ercion of the South into the Union.
The solemn Spectator flippantly fn
quires whether Senator Hoar does not
chastise his children when they are
naughty and imagines a Louisiana
Congressman talking consent after the
military occupation whereby the State,
after its purchase from Napoleon, was
reduced to order. The Spectator then
asks if the Americans are going to give
up Texas and hand California back to

the Mexicans, saying it believes great
races, when the hour of opportunity
comes, expand greatly, regardless of
arguments.
Continuing, the Spectator remarks:
"We believe the Americans are to be
one of those. Fifty years hence, under
their control, the Filipinos will be or
derly, law-abiding persons like our own
Hindoos, with a taste for acquiring
money and the foible of believing that
rhetoric is an admirable substitute
alike for thought and action."
WILL BRITAIN OBTAIN
FOOTHOLD IN PHILIPPINES?
NEW YORK. Jan. 14.â A Sun London
special says: A subject which will en
gage the attention of Embassador Choate
immediately upon his arrival in England
is one which links the political fate of the
Philippines and that of the British West
Indies. Several public hints have been
made within the last few weeks as to the
great mutual advantage that would ac
crue to the United States and Great Brit
ain from the latter's rellnquishment of
her principal possessions in the West In
dtea in exchange for a foothold in the
Philippines.
I will not venture to assert that there
have already been important pourparlers
on the subject, and that consultations and
an exchange of papers bearing thereon
between the foreign and colonial offices
have Taken place- this weeK, because such
an assertion would probably call out
prompt and official denial. I will, how
ever, go so far as to affirm that such a
project will encounter no serious oppo
sition In either of those departments of
the British Government. Tt would be pre
mature to say more. I will add only that
this is one of the possihle solutions of the
Philippine problem which are within
range of practical politics.
NAVAL TRANSPORT
SERVICE TO MANILA
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.-The Navy De
partment to-day took the initial steps for
the prosecution of its plans for the forma
tion of a naval transport service. It pro
mulgated a schedule for the sailing of the
two vessels now available for this service,
by which the Solace is to sail from New
York for Manila in January and July, and
the Buffalo is to run from San Francisco
to the same port in April and October.
The schedule will give a three months'
service to begin with, allowing the vessels
ample time to refit between trips. They
will carry stores for the forces in the
Philippines, and Admiral Dewey will not
only erect a storehouse for the goods but
will have the Celtic and ttie Culgoa to
use as refrigerator ships, to use for the
storage of fresh provisions.

WONDERS OF FRUITS
GROWN IN CALIFORNIA
NEW YORK, Jan. 14. â At the annual dinner given by the Fruit
Auction Company to the fruit trade of New York last evening J. H.
Schneider, in the course of his address, said:
"The fruit trade has in the year just passed undoubtedly been
amazed at the performance of California. We have received oranges
from that State during every month of the year, and when we con
sider that five years ago scarcely a box of California citrus fruits
could be disposed of here to advantage the growth of this trade alone
is beyond comprehension of man. Out of a total output of 15,000 car
loads of oranges and lemons in 1898 our city alone has disposed of
2000 carloads, or nearly a seventh of the entire crop."
Greeley expects that within one month

to be supplied will be a line between

and for greater security fastened thra
halter rope around his chest, tying it
into a running knot. The whistle of a
locomotive frightened the animal, which
started to gallop and plunged around a
two-^cre lot, dragging the boy after it.
Ttw continual striking of his head and
on various obstructions soon
r< ndered the lad unconscious, and the
rope, tightening from the repeated
plunges, caused a cessation of respira
tion.
After a half-hour's wild run the horse
was caught by the boy's brother and the
rope cut. A physician summoned from
Salinas says the boy is in a critical con
dition and there is no hope for his re
covery, as he suffers from concussion of
the brain as well as external and internal
injuries.

MANILA, Dec. 8. 1898.
... :â¢ The last transport has arrived and
the Eighth Army Corps is at home. With
every transport there came mall in
pmall quantities, and for over a week
the bnys were made happy by receiving
a letter or two each almost every day.
With the Newport about twenty Amer
ican womenâ wives of officersâ made
their appearance. They, together with
those already here, should form a col
lection of femininity large enough to
create a little social life.
Every one at home seemed to remem
t?er the season that is rapidly ap
proaching, and there have been enough
boxes sent down to create fifty dysen
tery epidemics. I am sure that some
order restricting the boys will soon be
put into force; otherwise they will eat
â¢so heartily that they will be forced to
folly w. the example of the grizzly and

While I am on the subject of distinc

1 wish to call attention to Corporal
Frank B. Mosley of the Eighteenth
Regular Infantry. At the taking of
Manila the Eighteenth was the first
regiment in the advance on the
trenches. Some of the old soldiers in
the regiment had been "joshing" the
rookies and warning them against "cold
When the critical moment ar
rived Mosley, thf-n a private, sprang
out ahead of th" whole command and,
tiling the old fellows to watch a
"rookie," sprang forward to the
trenches, which he entered amid a
storni of bullets thirty yards ahead of
the balance of the command. That was
how he won his stripes.
Sickness is steadily decreasing.
Thoutrh the men are in a better state
of health, collectively, than ever be
for<*, yet the consequences of past ill
â md suffering are severe enough to
unfit many a poor fellow for active
duty for a long time to come. Many
of tV>sp fellows have received their dis
cfc. treys and will leave for home in Ihe
first transport that departs. How soon
the balance of the regiment will get

ALBERT PARR'S DEATH
VEILED IN MYSTERY
Peculiar Circumstances Attending
His Fatal Plunge Over an
Embankment. â¢
SAN JOSE, Jan. There are some un
explalnable things surrounding the death
of Albert Parr, the blacksmith who drove
over an embankment of Los Gatos Creek,
near St. James street, on Thursday night.
Parr left his home on the. Almaden road,
six miles northwest of here, at 2:30 o'clock
in the afternoon. At 5:30 he was In the
City store on Market street and an hour
later he called at the blacksmith: shop of
James Robinson at^El Dorado and San
Pedro streets. After thiÃ no trace ol him
could be found until his body was discov
ered the next morning under his team' in
the creek.
Where Parr spent the evening is a mys
tery. It is thought he must have driven |
over the embankment at about midnight, i
or he would have been seen or heard by
passersby. Parr was probably s-timnell |
by the fall and â¢ died from* exposure and I
from being trampled -' on .hy his horse. I
He had been 111 with the grip and very '

DIES A VICTIM OF
TRICHINOUS PORK
Felix Conti Paspes Away at Tomales,
and Three Others Are Very-
Low.
TOMATOES, Jan. 14.â Felix Conti, the
victim of a diet of trichinous pork, was
buried here to-day. Grandi's life may be
saved, say the doctors. Conti's wife is
very low, and Anzini Is just alive.
A singular fatality seems to hang over
this gloomy ranch by the sea. Mrs. Casa
rotti died here. Situated in a deep hol
low, dark and damp, the water supply has
been of dubious quality. The ordinary
residence, dairy houses and the great l>arn
and corral for cows have been crowded
down into this hole and conditions far
from wholesome have been a necessary
consequence, especially during the sea
son of heavy rains. Ample opportunity
for pigs to eat matter infected with
trichina is offered by the curroundings.
That other infected swine are on the
ranch seems almost a certainty.
Some years ago. the predecessor of
Uuuil on this place was an Italian luzued

significant circumstance in the light of
recent events.

ThjE POSITION OP THE JUSTICES.
{ *" I 'HE bandaged eyes represent the equaljty and
the ermine the purity of justice, administered
I * through the forms and in the tribunals' of the
* law. A shir upon the integrity of the bench is like
the spitting of scandalous venom .at a- woman. The
American people feel that while their courts are clean
they can meekly endure the filth of the lower depths
of politic?. For a Judge to be seen even carefully
picking lus steps through that nasty pool iS as shame
ful as the spectacle of a wife slipping into an abode of
sin.
For these reason^ the charge of Speaker Wright
against four Justices of our Supreme Court, now de-
I nied by them, is almost unexampled in its infamy, ana
ii true would have been a sickening revelation. He
made the accusation as an excuse for his own deep
treachery to his immediate constituents, to the State
and to the country. For the insult to the nation, ex
pressed by his vote for Dan Burns, he sought to
shield himself by quoting the imaginary advice of four
members of the most exalted department of the State
government A Jiid not cease to be a man or
j a- citizen, but, for the reason that he speaks for the
};:\\; "whose seat," as Hooker beautifully said, "is in
, the bosom or God and whose voice is the harmony
of the world." he is placed somewhat above ordinary j
' manhood 'and ordinary citizenship. This is the chiv- i
, alrous- tribute of a free people to the men who are j
: intrusted .with the protection of their rights and the !
; redress of their wrongs. Judges are supposed to
touch the world in its most vital interests, and yet to
live apart from the world, in the realm of undiluted
| truth and honor, so that they may rigidly apply I
j eternal principles to fluctuating facts.
Therefore, even where great and honorable states
men, with laudable ambition, are pressing toward the
toga, judicial interference is resented as an outrage j
and a crime. But for a Justice of the Supreme |
Court of California to champidn Dan Burns would!
reveal unspeakable moral leprosy, and, for plain rea
sons, would constitute almost an impeachable offense.
i Such advocacy would imply absolute disbelief in the
hirustantial record that has been published broad- !
] cast against this Mexicanized American by The Call j
I and by the reputable press of the State. Each one J
of these accusations, unless true, is a gross and in
defensible libel, for which newspaper proprietors,
irs and reporters, are both criminally and civily
liable. Dan Burns, if possessed of the strength of in
; nocence and integrity, has the inalienable right to
'â  invoke the>e remedies and to wash bis dripping repu
tation to the whiteness of snow. And yet the very
judicial officers who. if his apparently torpid sensibility
used to the point of common self
respect, would sit in the place of ultimate judgment,
. Speaker Wright has represented as having deliberately
1 prejudged a multitude of cases upon which it might j
thus become a necessity for them to pass. The annals of
the United States' do not contain the story of an atti
so humiliating, so despicable and so exasperat
ing. The Call, to which, as to citizens generally, ju
dicial reputation is dear and beyoÂ«d calumnious
: rumor? or uncorroborated statements, is glad to be
\ assured that a majority of our own appellate court
' have not voluntarily transferred themselves from the
bench to the lobby. It is hoped, moreover, that leg
islative resentment at such a challenge to decency as
! Speaker Wright has issued will insure the igno
. mioious defeat of the defiant candidate for the Federal
â¢'Senator ship, on whose behalf so transcendent a deg
i radation was falsely promulgated. As for the Speaker
, himself, his broken pledges will not be seriously un
derscored by one additional falsehood.
THE IMPERIALISTIC DRIFT.
WE have already commented upon remarks by
General Merritt and others disparaging to the
constitution in connection with the acquisition
of the Philippine Islands. The subject is attracting
the notice of reflecting and educated citizens all over
the country, and is by no means exhausted. The
possible addition to our flag of a black star, repre
senting barbarism, paganism, Mohammedanism,
polygamy and all the other degraded characteristics
of the nine millions who form the mongrel Asiatic
population of the Philippines, is exciting not only
apprehension, but positive alarm. The drift in favor
of imperialism and the imitation of Great Britain,
though not to be discerned in any formal utterances
of the President of the United States, has neverthe
less been manifested in official circles. For example,
James Wilson, the Secretary for Agriculture, in his
annual report, speaks of increased trade relations be
tween the United States and its "insular dependen
dencies." This is not the only expression of similar
import to be found in the public documents of 1898.
The sensational press constantly belittles, derides and
misrepresents the constitution, every great expounder
of that instrument, and every American statesman
whose name has been a household word and whose
reputation has been held dear among the American
people. There have been so many evidences of flip
pant disregard of the most sacred principles of our
government that thoughtful and earnest men feel the
necessity of arresting the tendency toward retrograde
revolution.
It has been proved beyond controversy and with
out even the semblance of intelligent contradiction
that the retention of the Philippines, either as a
colony or as an Asiatic addition to our territory,
would be a gross violation of fundamental law, op
posed to the spirit and the objects of our political
institutions, a departure for which there is no pre
cedent, and an act of deliberate treachery toward
mankind. The fact, however, has not been clearly
explained that our claim of ownership of the Phil
ippines, under the recent treaty of Paris, is in itself
a relapse toward the tyrannical and illogical doc
trines of the Middle Age?, which were expelled from
our soil by the Revolutionary War and by our Gov
ernment, and the repudiation of which in relation to
Cuba was the official justification for the late war.
Spain held the Philippines as she retained Cuba, not
withstanding her claim resting upon discovery, un
der the rejected dogma of the divine right of kings.
She had no other title or source of title. This dogma
necessarily denied fhe existence in the inhabitants,
as against the monarchy, of any rights, natural or
conventional. There had been prolonged rebellions
in Cuba and in the Philippines, and the interference
of the United States was put solely on tlie ground of
humanity and to insure to the Cubans an opportun
ity to exercise their conceded right of self-govern
ment.
When the treaty of Paris was framed the situation
hi the Philippines was that Spain claimed the sov
ereignty she had exercised for centuries: that we
had captured Manila and occupied other portions of
the island of Luzon, and that the actual possession
of the archipelago was held by. the nine millions or
thereabouts who composed its population. So much
of the title of Spain by divine right as remained was
transferred to us for twenty millions and in recog
nition of our military and naval supremacy, and we
now claim that this transfer, with or without their
consent, carried it the nine millions who,
whether as subjects or citizens, politically belong to
THE SAS FKAXCISCO GALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1899.
the United States and must be disciplined, if neces
sary, to consummate the transaction.
It is devoutly to be hoped that we may not have to
shoot the principles of the Declaration of Indepen
dence into the Filipinos. But if they refuse'peacefully
to accept our offer of American liberty, then it would
seem that their acceptance must be enforced at the
cannon's mouth. They must either submit or be
bombarded into submission. Our conception of
freedom regulated by law, of government for the peo
ple and by the people, if necessary, must be rammed
down their throats.
This decision of the expansionists, who deny that
they are imperialists, is a new application of Ameri
can doctrines. Old-fashioned citizens insist that it
involves treason and revolution, and that we are now j
doing what our Revolutionary Fathers shed their !
blood to extirpate, and with professions of sentiment
which are false, but for the actual benefit of specu
lators and gamblers, denying the high-sounding
manifesto that we paraded before the world when our
Embassador left Madrid. Perhaps some of the ex
pansionists who are convinced that the masses have
closed their eyes and fallen into deep sleep can point
out in the constitution, in judicial decisions, in the i
practice of our State Department, or in some ;
r-.cknowledged record, the particular American prin- ;
ciple or precedent under which, through our cap- '
ture of Manila and the twenty-million purchase from j
Spain, the nine millions of Filipinos have been con- j
verted from more or less successful rebels against
Spain into involuntary subjects or citizens of the
United States. Perhaps they can reconcile this
proposition with the entrenchment of freedom in the
constitution that was the chief triumph of the Civil
War. Perhaps they can establish the consistency,
especially in the face of the Congressional response . I
to the unanimous demand of California, of replacing
the African question in the South by an Asiatic
question in the West. But. when they do these
things, they will have succeeded in fastening a
"'bridle in the jaws' of the people, causing them to
err." and they will have followed the injunction: j
"Prophe>y not unto- us. right things. Speak unto us!
smooth things: prophesy deceits." Freedom con- |
ferred on Asiatics by bombardment and military j
force will be a unique revelation of manifest destiny,
and will necessitate some new fabrications from the i
reconstructed Jefferson and the expanded version of j
Cooley on Constitutional Limitations.
fl LOSS TO THE NATION.
BY the death of Nelson Dingley not only Maine
but the whole country suffers a severe loss. He
was one of the statesmen we can ill spare at
this juncture in our affairs, for he was an acknowl
edged master of those economic problems which are
now pressing for solution, and his wise counsel and
leadership would have materially aided Congress in
leaching right conclusions concerning them.
Mr. Dingiey's fame will be chiefly associated with
tariff measures, and particularly with the act which
now protects our industries and regulates our com
merce. It is not likely that any radical change will
be made in the act for many years to come. It is
now about midway in the second year of its existence,
and month after month, despite the disturbance in
trade caused by the war. it has worked out a com
plete vindication of the financial skill and economic
ability of its distinguished author.
So far as tariff measures are concerned, Mr.
Dingley may be said to have completed his task, but
there- remain financial questions to be dealt with in
the settlement of the currency, and the important one
of providing well devised legislation for the up
building of our merchant marine. On these meas
ures the nation expected great service from him and
counted upon his zeal, his patriotism, his energy and
his skill to accomplish the prompt enactment of the
desired legislation. Death has taken him at a time
when his presence in Congress was of vast value to
the republic, and it comes as a loss which will be
felt throughout the Union.
Mr. Dingley was one of those statesmen who rise
to eminence by patient, laborious study and a self
sacrificing devotion to the public. His energies and
his rare business capacity, had he applied them to
the advancement of his private fortune, would have
made him a rich man. He turned aside from the al
lurements of personal gain and worked with an eye
single to the welfare of his country. It is gratifying
to know that the people appreciated his true worth
and freely accorded him the honors to which he was
entitled. He passes now into history as another of
those illustrious sons of Maine of whom all Ameri
cans are proud, and his memory will long be cher
ished by his countrymen.
THE NEVADA SENATORSHjIP.
COLONEL JACK CHINN, who has hitherto
been associated exclusively with Kentucky
politics, is now playing a star part in the Sena
torial melodrama in Nevada. Senator Stewart and
Congressman Newlands have the leading roles in the
play as contestants and rivals for the Senate, but
Colonel Chirm is making most of the uproar and at
tracting most attention.
It is not altogether clear by what title or right the
Colonel is taking part in the contest. It was as
serted at one time that he had been sent out by the
Democratic National Committee to help Stewart,
but that has been denied by the chairman of that com
mittee, and the Colonel himself has declared that
if any impertinent person wishes to know why he is
at Carson and what he is doing there they must apply
to Blackburn, McMillan, Daniels or some other dig
nitary in the far East.
His entrance into Nevada politics has been hailed
with satisfaction by the supporters of Stewart, but
the independent citizens of Nevada are shying bricks
at him. The Silver State, for example, after noting
bis pernicious activity in the Senatorial fight, says:
"We ask in all candor if it has come to such a pass,
after long years of electing non-residents to that
high position, that a further indignity is to be placed
upon us by having non-resident lobbyists? Has it
come to such a pass that we are not considered wise
enough to select our own Senator? Have we degen
erated to such an extent that we need outside ad
vice?"
We are Dot in the confidence of Colonel Chirm. nor
of Senator Stewart, but we regard it as a wager so
safe that one can risk a big bonanza against a little
banana on it that with the presence of the Kentucky
fire-eater in Nevada the Southern Pacific Railroad
has something to do. That corporation is seeking to
dictate the election of Senators all over the Pacific
Coast. Its agents are of many kinds, and their name
is legion.
If; therefore, the people of Nevada desire to find
out who has imposed upon them the indignity of
trying to boss their Senatorial choice by the in
fluence of outside lobbyists they should apply to the
notorious knockery in San Francisco. Mr. Herrin,

TRAVELING LIBRARIES.
Their Originâ Development in New York and Wisconsin.
Object With Possibilities When Adopted in
California.
"It is, after all, not the few great libra
ries, but the thousand small ones that
may do most for the people."
The Bth day of February, 1593, is a
red letter day i:i the annals . ot . the
j library worM. 'On this date the flrst
I traveling library was Bent out by the
Regents of the University of New York,
to begin in f that State a form of popu
lar instruction which has achieved in
stant success. Ric!h in the possession
of nearly 600 libraries in general use,
! varying in size from 1000 to 400,000 vol-
I umes, New ; York is also fortunate in
having some of the ablest librarians in
the Union, and an enlightened public
sentiment respecting the educational
; value of libraries. i^inual legislative
': appropriations of $25,000 enable theUni
! versity Regents not only to aid weak
i local libraries, but, besides, to create a
i large duplicate department in the State
'â  library.. ' From this department the
' traveling libraries were dispatched.
â  They consist of 50 to 100 v.olumes, being,
in fact, miniature libraries, put up in
bookcases, and are sent for terms of
i three or four months on their' work of
education. The use of the books is free,
I 'under simple rules, including a guar-
I aniee f6r the safety of the library, but
; the receivers pay - freight charges both

Our space does not allow quoting of
details of the establishment bt the sys
tem, but it may be observed that strug
gling libraries have been- encouraged,
many new ones started, schools bene
fited beyond me&suve, gi tings
made more efl tension < i
quickened to stronger 'life, and- resi
dence at summer hotels made more en
joyable by the visits of these libraries.
During the last year particular atten
tion has been paid to the needs of study
clubs, and it is now possible for a club
in any part of New York to obtain from
the Kegents entire libraries upon spe
cial subjects under study by the club.
Among these are economics, agricul
ture, literature, history and other de
partments. Every possible attention is
paid to all genuine wants, and the 657
traveling libraries now in success
ful use indicate the esteem in which
they are universally held. These are
some of the results of six years of
thoughtful, energetic action in the Em
pire State, under the direction of Melvil
Dewey.
Turning to Wisconsin, we see a field
\ in which some of the finest library ex
tension work has been accomplished
under totally different conditions from
! those just noted. Comparatively
! State, with extensive areas of forest
i and of land deforested in certain sec
| tions, sparsely populated in whole re
gions with settlers from- Germany, Swe
den and Poland, and, with slight gener
al knowledge of library benefits, it was
( Impossible to launch the traveling
; library system with State aid in 1896.
Fortunately, Senator J. H. Stout, rec
i ognizlng the urgent need, generously
j placed funds at the disposal of the new
I library commission for the starting of
; twenty-five libraries in the county of
'â  Dunn. This number he has increased
â to thirty-seven. Emulating this liberal
! example, a banker, Mr. . J. D. Witter,
i provided the means for twenty-five li
| braries for Wood County. The work
â¢ was to be confined to these two coun
i ties (each of the area of Alameda Coun
! ty), to be under close local supervision,
I and designed for farming communities,
> but free to all. The books chosen were
1 popular ones of interesting travel and
j biography, the best of modern and
' standard fiction, while science, history
and children's books were not over
looked. Additions to the books sent were
soon made of old magazines, picture
! papers and children's periodicals, all of
which were to be retained in the neigh
borhood. Local associations were re
| quired to be formed, but no expenses
beyond freight charges were to be met.
In Dunn County, of the thirty-four
stations established for the care of the
| libraries, twenty-two were in farm
j houses, nine in postoffice.s, two in stores
i and one in a railroad depot, thus bring
ing the supplies of books into closest
touch to the people.
The benefits conferred by these librar
ies can hardly be computed; in Dunn
i County they reach in their range prac
tically all of the 16,000 population living'
beyond the limits of the city of Meno
nionie. Joyous recreation, instruction,
sympathy with the world, an uplift
! from grinding toil, sweetness and light
I entering darkened lives, and a quicken
ing of mental power have been its fruits
to adults: while to thousands of chil
dren it has been a veritable entrance
j into a new world of picture and story,
' and the beginning of higher ideals of
life.
Awakened public sentiment secured
annual appropriations from the Legis
lature of $4000, providing for the main
tenance of two efficient field secretar
ies. Still another result, though not
unexpected, is seen in the founding of
eighteen local libraries within the past
year. Other private donors, clubs and
federations have taken up this pioneer
work in various portions of the State,
and to-day there are over 160 traveling
libraries circulating in as many as a
score of counties.
Of the traveling library work in other
States it may be mentioned that Mich
igan, lowa and Ohi>> have successively
adopted it by stated appropriations, and
in twenty additional States reports are
given that individuals, clubs and espe
cially federations are constantly in
creasing the number and range of these
libraries.
Particularly does the cause of educa
tion appeal to women's clubs, and the
I organized power of the best women .if
] the land is now effectively exerted f< r
! the spread of good literature among The
j masses of the people. So rapid has
the growth of this movement thai It
I is estimated that in these twenty-five
' States there are now over 2000 traveling
\ libraries in circulation with al
000 volumes.
No more hopeful sign in our con
schools can be seen to-day than the
wide-spread conviction among our edu
i cators that largest possible atl
j should be paid to the reading of
books in the early years of Bchoo] life.
It is beginning to be- realized tha;
to the cultivation of the power
'â  serration In youngest children, is the
â  importance of thorough teaching of the
1 language through whose words th<
I to think and to express their thoughts
i through life. Less crowding of the.cur
â  rieulum and more intimate acquaint
i ance with English literature is the com
| ing slogan.
The importance of traveling libraries
to the intellectual well-being of Cali
fornia has long been discussed and ran
with difficulty be over estimated. This
: State Is, regretful as is the fact, but
, scantily supplied with free public
libraries, there being less than fifty
: within its limits. For instance, in the
| San Joaquin Valley, south of Stockton,
: the two little libraries of Fresno and
Tulare are the only free libraries in that
i large territory with fully ion.ooo people.
Tn the dozen northern counties of the
â¢State the two libraries at th<3 wirlely
; separated points of Marysville and
Eureka are th:- only known ones for a
population of 125,000. Looking along
the coast between San Francisco and
; the city of Santa Barbara, in the enor-
I mous extent of 350 miles through some
of our most fertile valleys, there Is
but one up-to-date, influential free
librarj to be foundâ the one of 15,000
volumes at Santa Cruz. This deficl
Is not wholly owing to a lack of public
spirit, but in part to want of knowl
edge of the existence of a law provid
ing for the support of libraries by tax
ation, still there is wide-spread Indif
ference upon the subject; even frozen
la, where George Kennan discov
ered well equipped public libraries, can
Ki\-f points to many a California town
â which prides itself on its standing and
attractions.
The beneficial results attending the
introduction of traveling libraries in the
East will be realized here, providing al
:hat sound judgment in the selec
tion of book.- and business sense in
management are exercised. Mir
how- not performed by these
lat ing libraries, and it cannot be
expected that the adult of 40 years,
who, from choice or necessity, has not
acquired the reading habit, can genu
inely appreciate books. To all others,
the children, the young people especial
ly, and the older readers, the traveling
library has a mission of supreme value
in bringing: the best that has been
thought and said in the past and pres
ent before their minds. Emphatically
is it the boon of the age to the distant,
neglected dweller in the country's soli
tude.
Specifically, the use of traveling
libraries In California would insure the
starting of a largo number of free
libraries in our incorporated cities and
towns, which alone have the ii">\
tax for their" creation and maintenance.
In scores of other towns which an- not
: u^ated, particularly in the mining
counties, where there are very few
places with corporate powers, these vis
its would secure the establishment of
reading rooms, and, gradually, of local
libraries. Numerous are the wrecks of
little subscription libraries all over the
State which have failed solely for want
of regular supplies of such fresh, at
tractive !">'>ks as traveling libraries
would provide.
No greater want for our young peo
ple in the country exists at present than
a chance to continue the education be
gun in the common schools. Obtaining
the rudiments of knowledge, they now
needs the acquisition of power. Over
95 per cent of the scholars in the State
have no instruction beyond the gram
mar school, and of these a large per
centage do not graduate. Leaving
school, the country boy, when work
fails, has nowhere to go, has nothing to
interest him, and, sadly too often, be
comes a loafer. A few thousand dol
lars per annum invested in traveling
libraries will save untold numbers of
our youth from idle, dissolute living.
Says President Eliot (in referring to
university endowments), "Whoever
wishes tv do some perpetual good
in this world, whoever hopes to
win that finest luxury, must exert his
iniluence upon the young, the healthy,
and the promising."^
Some striking testimony of the worth
of libraries was given nt a recent gath
ering of librarians in Sacramento, when
a prominent visitor stated that at the
age of 12 he was obliged to become a
breadwinner, and as^ibed much of his
success in life to the aid afforded by
the public library.
It is plainly evident that California
cannot now undertake a State system
of traveling libraries. That will fol
low in due time. Private liberality
must be relied on for moans with which'
t" prosecute this great work of home
education in our midst. These means
will not be wanting, as paat experience
in other phases of educational work
among us abundantly proves. It is one
of the interesting features in this move
ment that, ones understood in its scope
and its bearing upon the welfare of the
country people, who Before have been
neglected in all other library develop
ments, helping hands have been held
out to aid them. The work in our State
can be begun in many directions. With
the Los Angeles public- library aa ;i
base, the donation of $1000 will equip
twenty traveling libraries as the first
Installment for that region. In Stock
ton, the strong Woman's Club can find
a field of exceeding usefulness by sup
plying destitute towns in that vicinity.
In El Dorado County the work of send
ing out a few libraries into adjoining
hamlets has already been started by
one of its honored, men. The new Fed
eration of Woman's Clubs In thr San
Joaquin Valley can, In their own neigh
borhood, make common cause with
their Eastern sisters, who are pressing
this missionary labor so effectively in a
score of States.
Perhaps no finer philanthropy could
now be devised for the State at large
than for some interested person to do
nate $500f> or $6000 to the State Univer
sity for the purpose of beginning in a
systematic manner the supply of trav
eling libraries to destitute localities.
Those willing servants, the Regents,
would doubtless accept the trust and
experienced librarians would attend to
its performance.
The Library Association of California,
of which Mr. F. J. Teggert, librarian of
the Mechanics' Institute in this city, is
secretary, is earnestly Interested in pro
moting the cause, and cheerfully
furnish needed information.
President Jordan, in one of his ad
dresses, pithily says that "The unedu
cated man looks out upon life through
narrow â windows." Gladl" does the
State of California annually spend
$7,000,000 on schools and university,
that her boys and girls, hor young men
and maidens, may view life through
broad windows.' The traveling library
comes to increase the horizon by wider
outlook upon the beautiful worlds of
nature, art, poetry and song, by con
tact with men in history, science and
literature, by never-ending progress in
"preparation for complete living."

SAVING TIMBER FROM FIRE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASKED
TO LEND ITS AID.
"Urgent Need for Berkeley and Palo
Alto Universities to Establish
a Course of Instruction
on Forestry.
An important conference of representa
tive from the Miners' Association and
Sierra Club will be hold next Satur
day at the Chamber of Commerce. Its
purport will be tlu devising of ways and
means fur the preservation of the for
â¢ of California.
A committee consisting of J. Â». Le
Conte and Elliott McAllister of the
Sierra Club has been making an ex
haustive Inquiry Into the subject, and in
v report which they have submitted de
clare that something should be done to
protect California's forests from the de
structive fires that run through them
during the summer months.
The report in substance is as folllows:
"A necessity seems to exist for the two
universities of Stanford and BerKeley
to establish a course of systematic In
.. struction on the subject of forestry, a
Bsity as nal as that which has de
â â¢. .nianded instruction Tn many of the divi
sions of the mining or agr. ultural de
' i>artm<-nts of these institute
: "Action has been taken by the Miners'
Association in regard to the best
method of preserving the watersheds of
pur rivers, and by the Hoard of Trade for
forest prote< tion. Th>-rc is a desire to
â¢.take up the subject common to the agri
â¢ cultural, mining and in fact all the pro
â  ductive interests of the State, and the two
great resources, the water sources and
thi' forests, should be properly cared for.
"Vast tracts of land along the sum
mits of our mountains in California have
withdrawn from location, and it is
only rieht that we should ask the Federal
rnment to take the necessary steps
heir further protection from lire and
ir preservation for the future.
"And, again, th>- necessity of a prop- r re
tization makes itself manifest as
irs )co by, and as vast tracts are
by the lumber men to supply tTic
: market and by the railroads for their lo
tives. When the lirst and best tim

natural reforestization which follows ts of

Ititudes of the Sierras and Southern;
California no reforestization takes place
at all.
â¢â¢The time, therefore, is fast approach
ing when the United States Government
and private corporations will be asking
leal advice on the subject of for
ests, their protection and the reproduction
â  quality of timber. A properly
ted forester should be able to find

The time is not far distant when

are â  to whom any public or
may turn for information and

Is tl "iir universities to offer
Instruction to their students. Such;
ires would be eagerly sought, not
by the few who might desire to

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
â¢ A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and
â¢ . - Effectual Cure for It.
â -:..*'â  Catarrh of the stomach has long been
.considered the next thing to incurable.
.The usual symptoms are a full or bloat-
â¢ in;; sensation after eating, accompanied
sometimes with sour or watery risings,
.;k formation of gases, causing pressure
. â¢â¢â  on the heart and lungs and difficult
â¢â â¢ breathing; headaches, fickle appetite,
â  uervousnesa ar.tX a. Ee'ieral played out,
languid feeling.
There is often a foul ttMe in the
â  mouth, coated tongue and if the interior
'â¢'. .of the stomach could be seen it would
-.: show a slimy, inflamed condition.
â¢ The cure for this common and ob-
stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
â¢ to ferment and irritate the delicate mv-
â¢ oous surfaces of the stomach. To secure
a prompt and healthy digestion is the
one ssary thing to do and when
normal digestion is secured the ca-
tarrhul condition will have disappeared.
f ording to Dr. llarlanson the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase,
â  Aseptic "Pepsin, a little Nux. Golden
â¢ Seal and fruit acids. These tablets can
now be found at all drug stores under
the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
â¢ and not being a patent medicine can be
.used with perfect safety and assurance
'. that healthy appetite and thorough dl-
" â¢geÃtion will follow their regular use
.after meals.
Mr. U. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn
street, Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh
â is a local condition resulting from a
'â 'neglected cold in the head, whereby the
â¢ lining membrane of the nose becomes

WEATHER PROBABILITIES.
Professor Hanrmon Says Conditions
Are Favorable for More Rain.
Professor Ilammon of the weather bu- j
reau late last night said: "The rain
Which has deserted us during the last â¢
twelve hours will return, and the State
north of the Tehachapl will receive more
of the welcome precipitation. The local
conditions are as they generally are be
fore the coming of rain, and the pres
sure has been falling rapidly all along
the coast north of this city. The wind i
is blowing at the rate of fifty miles an !
houi at the mouth of the Columbia Rfver
and the storm will be with us once more.
The conditions have materially changed
from what they were this afternoon and
ram is assured us for Sunday, according
to mj observations.
"The last rainfall was about half an \
if,' 1: on the average for Northern Call
lornla. There was a trac of rain at San
Luis Obispo and a third of the way up
the San Joaquln Valley. About half an
inch fell in the Sacramento Valley. While :
we cannot deny the benefits that will ac- i
crue from this last precipitation, it id cer
tain that no part of the State has been!
sufficiently moistened and as much again :
will have 't.. fall before it matures a crop. !
The upper San Joaquln wants more |
water, and that quickly and decidedly, in j
amounts necessary to grow a crop.
At Eureka yesterday afternoon tlje
wind was northwest and it was cloudy, I
but no rain was falling. The snow now ;
!Â»iored in the mountains is a guarantee
01 plenty of water for mining purposes,

MARIA KIP ORPHANAGE
IS FREE FROM DEBT
A WELCOME REPORT MADE BY
THE TREASURER.
â¢ The Institution Has Profited by the
Bequests of Charitable People.
Officers Elected.
At the annual meeting of the directors
of the Maria Kip Orphanage, held in the
Diocesan Home on California street, the
report of the treasurer conveyed the wel
i come news that the debt of $17,140 which
was on the home a year ago had been en
tirely paid off. Jn her report the secre
tary, Mrs. T. P. Woodward, says:
When, less than a decade ago, this work,
which Is now the Ivime of X!- children, opened
its doors with thirteen girls, a generous gift
of $2000 from the late George- W. Gibbs wat us
only capital.
To be in the possession of a beautiful home,
surpassed by none of itÃ kind In the City,
which represents a piiW up capital of $60,000,
la truly enough happiness :or one year. How
this was all accomplished I will now relate.
To our kind friend ami advisor, J. C. John
: Wbose sudden death the early part of the.
year we have most sincerely mourned, we are
indt-bted for a legacy of $3000. Through Ihe
settlement of the Kalr estate our share of a I
generous gift to the orphan asylums of San
Francisco amounted to $7707, and by a lik>
bequest from the late James Quentln ?155'J
more has been added to our treasury.
It may be remembered that at the Inception
of the Valley Railroad, the Hihernla Hank,
alive to the good it would do the State at
large, subscribed for r.CK) shares ol Its stock.
I'nder the rules of the bank, that corporation
wtis unable to retain the stock, so It was
generously divided between several of the
charities of this city, and through the kind
ness of Thomas Brown tn<- Maria Kip Or
phanage was brought to the notice of the di
-. and we received Â»â¢â¢ â¢ nr portion seventy
flve shares of stock, which last month was sold
for the hnniiHMm*' sum ot 17500, enabling us to
make the last payment on our debtâ thus leav
ing our home free from all incumbrance.
The report closed with an earnest appeal
to the friends of the orphanage to assist
the managers In their endeavor to es
tablish an endowment fund, which in the

WANTED TO SURPRISE MOTHER
Mrs. Sckrader Has Lost Confidence in
Good Young Men Who Want
Hats.
Mrs. A. Sehrader, the proprietress of a
millinery store at 1913 Howard street, was
cheated out of two brand new bats last
night by two young men who entered her
store on the pretense of purchasing a
hat, "just to surprise mother," as one
of them put it. The obliging milliner
showed the "good" young man one of the
latest creation in feminine headgear. True
to the instincts of a well-raised son, he
examined the tower of nodding plumes
and daintily shaded trimmings, pronounc
ing it just such an article as would com
pletely surprise and gratify mother. The
companion of the â¢â good" young man,
however, suggested that he thought
mother would prefer a black hat to the
brown one selected, as it would be
more becoming to her complexion. This
suggestion was accepted by the "good"
young man who was so anxious to sur
prise mother. By the way of a compro
mise it was suggested thut two hats, a
black and a brown one, be taken to the
homo of mother at 1715 Howard street.
The obliging milliner, falling an easy vic
tim, handed out the two hats. Tha
"good" young man, who gave the name of
"Williams, said he would return Immedi
ately and pay the milliner's own price
for the one selected by mother.
From the story told to Captain Gillen
at tli^ Seventeenth-street station by Mrs.
Schiader at 10 o'clock last night it is
quite evident that mother had not made
a selection between the black and brown
bajts, for the "good" young man had not
returned with either the hats or the
equivalent.
Inquiry at 1715 Howard str^pt revealed
the cold fact to Mrs. Schrader that
neither mother nor the "good" young man
resided there. Consequently she loses two
of her beat hats, and must suffer the cha
grin of having been duped by two dapper
young thieves.

China and Its Government.
One of the most interesting lectures in
the regular Mechanics' Institute course
was delivered In the upper room of the
library last night by Professor John Fry
er, LL..D., on "The Government and
Laws of China." Professor Fryer has
spent the greater portion of the last thir
ty-five years in China and for the past
thirty years has been engaged in the
translation of scientific works for the
Government. In return fur his services
he has had conferred upon him one of
the civil noble degrees of China and is
entitled to wear a certain peculiar but
ton on his hat and a blazonry across his
breast. His lecture last night was brief,
complete and comprehensive. He covered
In a simple way all the different branches
of the complicated Chinese system of
government in such a manner that a child
could understand him as thoroughly a-s
the best educated man in the audience.
In his conclusion he said that China must
become fully civilized gradually. It has
much that Is good and much that is bad
in its laws, but an attempt to completely
overthrow the old system and Inject a
new In a day, as wns made by the Em
peror recently, must end in failure. China
will some day be on an equal footing with
the rest of the world, but the process
must be a slow one.

THE SAX FBAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JAKUARY 15, 1899.
JAPANESE STEAMER NIPPON MARU.
SHE arrived here from Yokohama via Honolulu yesterday and is one of
a line of vessels heavily subsidized by the Japanese Government to
run between San Francisco ;>nd the Orient. She was built in Eng
land, and has a list of English and a list of Japanese officers aboard.
The Nippon Mam and her sister ships are to run in conjunction with the
vessels of the Pacific Mail and O. and O. companies.

SENTENCE GIVEN AN AMERI

â 
British Ship Troop Set on Fire in
Yokohama Harbor â Narrow
Escape of the Coquille
River.
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha (Oriental Steam
ship Company's) line new steamer Nippon
Maru arrived in port yesterday morning
on her initial voyage. A description of
the vessel ami her slater ships, the Ajner-
Ica Maru and Hongkong Saru, was pub
lished exclusively in The Cull three
months ago. The Toyo Kisen Kalsha, t It â 
Pacific Mail and the O. and O companies
have joined Issues In the trade with
Japan and China, and in future each con
cern will run three steamers on a com
bined schedule.
The Nippon Maru is not a very hand
some boat, but her officers say she is fast
and very comfortable. As told exclusively
j in The Call last month, sho has two sets
'of ofticrrs. Captain F. R. Evans is in su
j preme command, but under him are three
; European and three Japanese officers,
while a similar state of affairs exists in
the engine room. Captain Evans holds
a Japanese as well as an English certifi
cate, but the engineers and other white
officers do not. When the Nippon Maru
went into commission in England â¢ her
crew was shipped for a year. Now the
Japanese law provides that a vessel th
ing the Japanese flag must be officered
by men having a Japanese certificate. The.
Englishmen would not pass the Japanese
examination, the company could not dis
charge them and so in order to comply
with the law officers with Japanese li
censes had to be added to the crew. And
| that Is how the Nippon Maru carries two
; sets of officers on deck and two In the en
gine room.
â¢ The Nippon Maru brought up 60 cabin
and 11 second-class passengers, besides
19 Japs and 17 Chinese in the steerage.
After leaving Yokohama a northeast
storm was run into that tested the
sea-going qualities of the vessel to the
j utmost. For thirty-six hours it blew a
hurricane and the ship was hove to. .The
cargo shifted, and when the gale was over
the crew was called in to trim ship. The
men refused, because it was Sunday, and
they were not railed upon to work that
day Finally the officers persuaded them
to trim the "cargo on a promise of extra
pay. It took the Nippon Maru 17 days
1 and 6 hours to make the run from Yoko
hama to Honolulu. For fourteen days
Purser W. Magee was down with a fever,
but is now on the road to recovery.
Among the 'passengers by the Nippon
Maru wprf Messrs. Lorsauo, Luna and
Marte, agents of Aguinaldo, who are on
their way to Washington. They took
passage on the steamer at Yokohama, and
arc in a hurry. A Secret Service Agent
of the Treasury took considerable interr
ntÃ In their arrival yesterday.
The Nippon Maru brings the news of
the firing of the British Bhip Troop m
Yokohama harbor. The vessel arrived
from New York farly in December and
on the night of the 14th she was found
to be on flre. As her cargo consisted of
coal oil there was a wild scramble among
the shipping to get out of the way. Sev
eral of the English ships sent assistance,
and crews from the men-of-war in -port
rendered valuable aid. After the lire had
been put out an examination showed that
some of the cans of oil had been opened
with a knife and a lot of sails in the laza
rette saturated with oO and fired. Emil
Gorig, who had been shipped in New York
as an able seaman but had been pro
moted to boatswain during the- passage,
was suspected. He was seen going doWn
the ventilator into the hold, and tin blade
of his Jaekknife just fitted the holes in
[ the oil cans. He was arrested, and on a
preliminary trial held to appear before a
fuli consular court.
Captain Richard Toulmin has been
sentenced to imprisonment "for the term
of his natural life" by a United States
Consular Court sitting at Shanghai. Toul
min is an American citizen and was in
command of the American river steamer
Dosing. On July 7 last the vessel was
chartered to carry 200 Chinese soldiers
from YVuchon to Tung Yuen, where a
rebellion was in progress. rheng Lei
San, a Chinese comprador, was really in
charge of the vessel and he and Captain
Toulmin liacl two or three quarrels over
the handling of the ship. Finally the
skipper tried to take a steamer chair away
from the comprador, and when the lat
ter resisted Toulmin shot him dead. John
Qoodnon, United States Consul General,
and H. R. Williams, United States Consul.
conducted the trial. Toulmin was to be
sent to Hongkong on the United States
gunboat Concord and from there to San
Francisco to serve out his sentence.
The steamer Coqullle River came near
to being a* total loss on the Tillamook bar
a fÂ«w days ago. During a lull in the
storm Captain Hansen thought he could
get to sea. but nearly lost his vessel in
stead. The channel at Tillamook takes a
zlz-zag course, and at the first turn the
Coquille River went ashore. After a lot
of backing she was at last got off and
headed again for the open sea. When
the captain thought he had cleared the
north spit he put the vessel on her course
for San Francisco. He had mistaken his
position, however, and in consequence
piled the steamer up on the south spit.
The crew went to work and jettisoned
50,000 feet of the lumber cargo and the
vessel floated. Captain Hansen would not
take any more chances, but got back into
Tillamook Hay as quickly as possible,
and there the Coquille River is bow.
The strainer Greenwood, which left here
on the iL'th Inst., lost a blade off her pro
peller while making Greenwood yester
day ami was compelled to return to tnis
pdrl for repairs.
Second Bngineer William Home of the
wrecked steamer Jewel died from his in
hnies at Caspar yesterday. He was in
jured by a falling timber while escaping
from the wreck.
Captain Jim Curley of the steamer
Herald wenl away quietly to Eureka last
week and got married. His wife was a
MisjÃ Maggie Carr, and she returned to
San Francisco with her husband. This
will be tin first Intimation that inr.ny or
Jim's friends will have that he is now a
benedict.
The steam whaler Alexander came over
from Oakland Creek yesterday and went
to Polsom-street wharf. Her old boilers
are t'> be taken out and the ones that
were recently taken out of the Bertha
put in. The Bertha is to have "now boil
ers, practically new engines and she has

suicide by hanging' shortly after being
locked up in a cell at the California-street
station. lie was discovered by the officers
on duty and cut down before he had lost

where he wan placed in a cell by Officer
i Nick Bakulich. When locked up he
threatened that lie would hang himself,
but it whs thought that as everything: had
been taken from him by which he could

paid to his threat. Bakulich, who was
on office duty, started upstairs, when his
attention was attracted by a sound in

and banged himself to the door of his cell.

The way to be well is to pay atten- j

They are the most important organs j
of the bodyâ the blood filters.
All the blood in your body passes
through your kidneys once every three
minutes.
The kidneys strain or filter out the
Impurities in the blood â that is their
work.
Purifying your blood is not a question
of taking a laxative or physic.
Does your blood run through your
bowels?
What the bowel-cleaner does is to !
throw out the poisons confined in your
bowels ready for absorption into your
blood, but the poisons which are j
already in your blood, causing your
present sickness, it leaves there.
There is no other way of purifying
your blood except by means of your
kidneys.
That is why bowel-cleaners fail to do
their workâ they forget the kidneys.
When you are sick, then, no matter
what you think the name of your dis- i

to afford aid to your kidneys by using

Nourished by the Air.
Careful experiments by M. Bouchard,
communicated to the Academic dea i i <-[-
fiici-s, demonstrate that the human body
takes some substance from the air which
adds to its weight. Subjects were found
to gain from lot) to GOO grains in breathing
air for an hour. The absorbed subs: ami'
cannot be carbonic acidt hs there is too
little of this gas in the atmosphere, and
It cannot be nitrogen. Oxygun is, no
dpubt, the gas absorbed, but tlip quantity
which enters the blood or oxidises the
hemoglobins is very slight. The excess of
I oxygen absorbed cannot be explained by
other known effects, such as tin- reactions
of albumen, some or which cause a reduc
tion of weight. There is every reason to
believe that the main augmentation of
welglit arises from the transformation of
j fat "Into glycogene. A dog which, was
given T-'jOO grains of fat to eat was found
, to 80 grains' weight in addition
through breathing tor ten or twelve hours.

London Pavements in the Olden Time
Occasionally a side pavement added to
the comfort of the foot passengers
and spared them the necessity of
floundering through the deep mire
of the roadway. These pavements,
however, were very partial, and pas
sengers made use of the highway,
soft with mud and filth thrown from tin
houses, and obstructed with heap* ol
manure, which dogs and swine made their
lair. The latter animal was so useful a
scavenger, and could be kept al bo little
expertise as to account for the pigsties
whit h stood in the main streets of all our
towns, even in T,ondon. When a royal pro
cession was expected to pass along the
narrow roadway, dogs and pigs were
driven indoors and gravel was thrown
down to make the road passable. Usually,
however, the streets were left In their
primitive noisomeness.â From "England

THE ALLEGED
MURDERESS
Advances Money for Legal
Assistance for Mrs.
Dickinson.
Woman Accused of Complicity in the
Murder of Wilson Still Asserts Her
Innocence.
iUISUN, Jan. 14.â H. McEwen has
dime to the rescue of Mrs. E. G. Dickin
son and supplied her with funds with
which to hire a lawyer to defend her
agaihst the charge of complicity in the
murder of Daniel H. Wilson, i.ast even
ing, just before his del arture for his
ranch, McKwcn visited the office
if Attorney George Lamont and placed in
his hands $135 to be handed over to ICn.
I*:. G. Dickinson. Mr. Lamont !s in Oak
;;h]<l to-day, but will return to Suisun to
morrow or Monday, when he will execute
rust. Mrs. Dickinson has been trying
to engage Mr. Lamont as her attorney,
but up to the present time he has re
turned no definite answer. This after
however. the woman was informed
by a messenger from Mr. Lamont's office
that an attorney had been engaged for
ad her interest* will be well guarded
from this time forward.
The knowledge that McEwen had not
. 3esorted her and that she was to have the
â¢ advice of counsel wrought a wonderful
. change- In the spirits of the accused
.woman. She was very much depreessed
hiring the morning, and her assertion
that she had slept very little during the
;. night was borne out by her appearance.
; She trembled with emotion when convers
ing, with callers and managed to keep
back the tears only with the greatest
â â â¢difficulty.
. This woman, who Is accused by the au
..thorltiea . of having been the head and
,: -life of the ospiracy that attained its
â â¢â  "object in the assassination of Dan Wll
â¢ son, is a latlon to those who have vis
;. '.ted her in the County Jail at Fairfield
since her Incarceration. Her appearance
. md actions belie her reputation.
; â¢ She does not impress one as a woman
Rho would commit murder or as one who
had ridden rough-shod over everybody
. ;vith whom she came Into contact for the
. last ten years.
â â¢ Mrs. Dickinson admits that she Is great
ly worried, but while she realizes that her
position is Berlous she gives no encour
agement to those who are hoping she
Mil break down and confess. She con
tinues to protest her innocence without
bitterness and with every evidence of sin
cerity.
The action of McEwen in putting up the
money for Mrs. Dickinson was a great
surprise to the attaches of the Sheriffs
office and those who have been instru
. mental In gathering the evidence against
Ihe trio. The fright given the rancher by
the District Attorney yesterday and his
frank admission that he was afraid of
his mistressâ so much so, in fact, that
he did not dare to talk freely about the
murder â thought to be the entering
wedge In securing from him sufficient in
â  formation to make the conviction of all
three prisoners absolutely certain. It ap
pears, however, that McEwen told the
truth when he said he feared Mrs. Dick
inson more than he did Deputy Sheriff*
or prison cells. He is apparently pos
sessed of more determination than he
ias been given credit for. It may be that
the payment of the money is, after all,
but the first move on his part to sever
relations with the woman, as he ex
pressed a desire to do, since he was ow
ing her moneyâ as much, if not more
â  than the amount placed in the hands of
â¢ Attorney Lamont.
. -Whatever his motive, he has given new
tourage to the accused woman and placed
the means for defending herself in her
- hands.
Mrs. Wilson complains of being unable
to sleep, and it is plain that prison life
apd fare do not agree with her. She pro
seats a sad spectacle, sitting alone in her
roll hour after hour crazing hopelessly at
:he padded walls which shut out the light
of freedom. She lias no one to put up
money for her. like her mother, and she
lays claim to the possession of no fri.
as does her brother. She says if the
court appoints a lawyer to defend her she
jvi)l bo satisfied; if nut t=ne will be satis
fled just the same.
"If they hang me, it will not he the
first innocent person that has suffered "
she says.
She sees no one but her jailer and an
ncrasional reporter, and no one Inquired
about her or seems to take any interest
In her
For the lirst time, Mrs. Wilson was to
3ay in a talkative mood. Heretofore she
has talked, but not with the freedom of
her mother and brother, answering only
such questions as she chose and carrying
an her side of the conversations in mono
syllables. To-day, however, she opened
the conversation, and proceeded to give
Borne reasons which she seemed to think
sught to convince the world of her inno-
Dence.
*'ThÂ«y may keen me hore until I die,"
she declared with unusual vehemence,
"but they will never get a confes?ion
from me hr-eause I have nothing to con
fess. I admit I am in a bad box and there
Ib no use denying that 1 am worried. I
cannot sleep night. Â«= Â...". I feel as though
I should ro crazy s â mir-timesâ but what
can I do? It Is not my fault that I am
hero and I have no one who would turn a
hand over to help mo.
"There is one thing I want to say,
though." she added, rising to her feet sud
denly, while her eyes glinted like steel,
."and that is. if ever 1 get out of this
place I will devote the rest of my life to
finding the murderer of Dan Wilson."
In describing the happenings at fihe Mc-
Ewen ranch on the evening of the murder,
Mrs. Wilson made one statement in direct
contradiction of her daughter, Mrs. Bay
land. The latter said, a day or two ago,
that her mnthr-r was outside the house on
the night in question until the shot was
and that as soon as she heard the
report Rhe came inside and got Into bed
with her clothes on. At the time she said
it was not an uncommon thing tor Mrs.
Wilson to retire for the night fully
3ref=sed. To-day Mrs. "Wilson positively
3eclared that she never in her life went
to bed without removing her clothes, and
'.hat on the evening of the murder she
sisrobed as usual.
Miller was as loquacious as usual to
3ay. He is always glad to receive visit
ors, especially if they will listen while he
repeats the oft-told tale of his where
abouts on the night of October 9, 1896.
Mrs. Dickinson, tired of prison fare, to
day and this evening mother, son and
daughter were served with dinner from
".urnolcl Hotel, at the expense o: the
former, who is the only one of the t:io
.f h funds. The profience of a well known
mind reader in town this afternoon sug
rosted the possibility of obtaining a con
n from one of the prisoners through
the application of hypnotism. Suppri r
Judge Buckles, who was in th" crowd, at
tracted by the street exhibition of the
expert, remarked that if the mind read-
Ing artist were taken into ons of the
rolls occupied by the allege-i murd^ rer
his accomplices, he would probably
i ;;rn something of value to the prosecu
tion. The Judge spoke witn apparent
seriousness, but. every one present was
iwarr that he would be the last to coun
k-nanc- such a proceeding, Â«o the hyp
notic experiment was not made.
â¢ District Attorney Devlin said to-day
that the preliminary examination would
be held some time during the present
week. The witnesses have been nearly all
located and served with notices to ap
pear. A letter was received at the Sher
â fff's office this afternoon from Mrs. Lucy
Owens, who was Wilson's housekeeper at
:he time the crime was committed. The
Â»pistle was dated Surf, Santa Barbara
County, and the woman expressed her
.willingness to come whenever wanted to
testify at the hearing. Mr. Devlin does
jot have much faith in the value of the
Â»vldence gathered by J. F. Stranahan,
who is now in Pendleton, Or. He says
Stranahan left Suisun in bad odor and he
will not send for him to testify at the
hearing as he believes his evidence would
weaken instead of strengthen the case
of the prosecution. Sheriff Savage is ill
with the mumps at his home in Yallejo,
and It is possible that the hearing may be
postponed until he is able to be out.
NEW CANAL BILL
BY DAVIS OF FLORIDA
It Provides That the Government
Shall Construct and Own the
Nicaraguan Waterway.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.âRepresenta
tive Davis of Florida has added to the
labors of the House committee on com
merce by introducing another bill for the
Nlcaraguaa canal. His bill follows the
general lines of the Hepburn bill for Gov
ernment ownership. Jt authorizes the
President to acquire, by purchase from
- of Costa Rica and Nicaragua "full
ownership, right, title and jurisdiction to
such portion of territory now belonging
to said States of Costa Rica and Nica
ragua as may be necessary or desirable
on which to build, construct and defend a
ship canal of such depth and capacity as
will be sufficient for floating ships of
commerce and vessels of war of the great
est tonnage and draft now in use, from a
Â§oint near Greytown, on the Caribbean
ea. by way of Lake Nicaragua, to or
near Brito, on the Pacific Ocean."
It is provided, however, that before
making such purchase the President shall
adjust and settle with any Government
with which the Government of the United
States may have entered into any treaty
on the subject of this canal, or any canal
acjoss the isthmus of Panama, so that
there shall be no question left as to full
and complete right in the Government of
the United States to build, construct and
fully defend such canal as contemplated.
The sum of $10,000,000 or so much thereof
as may be necessary is appropriated for
making arrangements.
SORROW IN THE HOUSE

WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â The House of
Representatives assembled to-day under
circumstances of deep and universal sor
row in the death of Representative Nelson
Dingley of Maine. As Speaker Reed en

SOUTH AFRICA MAY
HAVE A MEAT FAMINE
Millions of Cattle and Sheep Have
Perished Through the Drought
and Rinderpest.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â Owing to the
terrible ravages of the rinderpest and
ili. prolonged drought, South Africa is
threatened with a meat famine. During
the year ended May 1 last, according to a
report to the State Department from
United States Consul Stowe at Cape
Town, no less than 1,400,000 head of cattle
were lost from these causes, while in the
same time the loss of sheep was 2,086.000.
In many districts the drought has become
worse since May; all over the country
the farmers are selling their breeding
stock for slaughter, and the price of meat
is rapidly rising. In the cities it sells
now for from 20 to 40 cents per pound for
beef and 20 cents for mutton. Prices of
living are mounting to the danger point.
American flour and cornmeal are being
imported, the demand for the latter being
beyond the supply. Altogether, says the
Consul, the outlook for a large trade with
the United States in cereals is good, and
he regrets only* that the United States
cannot share in the large prospective
sales of frozen meat.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â The Treasury
Department has been advised that Passed
Assistant Engineer William C. Myers of
the revenue cutter McCulloch was guilty
of various misdemeanors while at the

Considerable damage was done at
Newcastle. In all parts of the city
roofs were blown off. The Vulcan Foun
dry was a heavy loser, as one side of
the big building was blown in and
greatly damaged.
The new six-story Heilman building,
which is in course of construction, was
badly damaged, part of the brick work
being blown down. Three houses in
South Newcastle were also blown over.

Linseed Oil Combination.
CLEVELAND, Jan. 14.â A new Unseed
oil combination has been formed, the in
corporation taking place in New Jersey
under the name of the American Linseed
Oil Company. The National Linseed Oil
Company of Chicago was incorporated

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14.â Dr. J. P.
Widney is no longer pastor of the

1000 persons was erected in South Los
Angeles street. Methodists from all
over the city flocked in. Branch Nazar
ene churches were organized in a dozen
small towns and the work seemed to be
in a flourishing condition until the
trouble arose which resulted in the
resignation of Dr. Widney.
The doctrine of the Church of Naza
rene resembles that of the early Metho
dist church and many of its members
profess sanctification. Since the estab
lishment of the church Bresee and Wid
ney have been associated in the pas
toral work. The constitution of the or
ganization made these ministers life
pastors. For a long time perfect har
mony seemed to exist.
The unpleasantness in the church be
gan at a camp-meeting held last No
vember. This particular meeting was
of the good old Methodist sort, and
those present gave vent to their feel
ings in shouts of rapture over their
saved condition or loud moans of re
pentance over their sins. Dr. Widney
was displeased and openly spoke his
mind about the doctrine taught by this
sect. He thought such teaching was
the means of doing incalculable harm
to human souls.
Dr. Bresee spoke to his brother pastor
on the subject, but Widney maintained
his stand. It was decided to call a con
sultation of the directors to take cog
nizance of the matter. The trustees
waived the question as to whether or
not the church was on the right track
to reach eternal life, but raised a ques
tion concerning the propriety of any or
ganization electing a pastor or pastors
for a life term. Before the investiga
tion ended the trustees asked for the
resignations of both pastors. No
sooner had their resignations been ac
cepted than Dr. Bresee was appointed
pastor of the church. This froze Wid
ney out, and he is without a pulpit.
His supporters say that the action of
asking for the resignations of both was
a well-planned plot to force him out of
the church. The Breseeites do not deny
this charge, but retort that It saved
Widney from being publicly asked to
vacate his pulpit.
According to the supporters of
Bresee, the original trouble arose from
the fact that Widney was ambitious to
build a church in which the congrega
tion of the Nazarene might worship.
The trustees listened to the proposition
and thought favorably of it. Dr. Wld
ney said that his desire was to have the
deed for the proposed new edifice in his
own and his wife's name as long as
they should live, and that after they
were gone they would arrange to turn
the property over to the church. This
arrangement did not please the trus
tees and they declined to accept Wid
ney's proposal. After that the rela
tions between Widney and the congre
gation seemed strained. People began
to complain that the pastor was preach
ing a strange doctrine and that he had
departed somewhat from the faith of
the church. This difference was mark
ed, as Bresee preached in the morning
and Widney in tho afternoon and even
ing. The trouble grew and spread, per
vaded the entire congregation, divided
the members and reached a climax
when the trick was neatly turned by
forcing Widney out of his pulpit.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
EAGAN MUST
ANSWER FOR
VILE WORDS
To Be Court-Martialed for
Y\\s Defamation of
Miles.
Before the Trial BegiQS the Com
missary General Will Be Placed
Urjder Arrest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â The
Herald's Washington correspond
ent sends the following: Formal
announcement will be made by
the President or Secretary of
War to-morrow or Monday that
Brigadier General Charles P. Ea
gan, commissary general of sub
sistence, will be court-martialed
without delay for his defamation
of Major General Miles.
Before the trial of General Eagan oc
curs that officer will be relieved from
duty as commissary general and placed
under arrest. This decision is the re
sult of the careful consideration given
the matter by the President and Sec
retary of War, who foresaw imme
diately after the submission of the
statement, as stated in the Herald, that
there could be no other course than to
direct a court-martial of an officer who
so Hagrantly violated the principles of
a gc-ntleman and officer of the United
States army.
It developed to-day that rather than
prefer charges against General Miles,
which General Eagan proposed to make
in his statement before the commission,
the chief clerk of the commissary and
sulipistence department threatened to
resign. The chief clerk is William A.
Decaindry, a member of the Cosmos
Club of this city and well known in lit
erary and scientific circles. Mr. De
caindry and the commissary general
have not been enjoying cordial rela
tions, and the trouble culminated when
General Eagan desired the chief clerk
to prepare charges against General
Alihs. Tli-' latter refused to obey his
chief and wrote out his resignation, but
by the advice of friends he has not pre
sented it.
The determination to court-martial
General Eagan was formally reached
to-day after the President had been in
conference with several public men and
had consulted with Secretary Alger,
who was at the White House for an
hour. It is not intended to let the beef
controversy creep Into the trial. So far
as the President is concerned he has no
desire to permit a controversy and he
will accept the report of the War Com
mission as final.
General Eagan will be tried on
charges arising out of the violent lan
guage he employed In attacking Gen
eral Miles. The most important charge
will be "conduct unbecoming an officer
and gentleman, in violation of the sixty
flrst article of war."
The penalty for violation is dismissal.
He will probably also be tried for "con
duct to the prejudice of good order and
military discipline in violation of army
regulations."
There is every reason to believe the
President and Secretary of War have
given serious consideration to the char
acter of the charges which will be pre
ferred against General Eagan, and it is
understood orders will be given to
Judge Advocate General Lieber early
next week to prepare the necessary
specifications to support the charges.
There is no reason to believe that
General Eagan will apologize to Gen
eral Miles, and if he should do so the
commanding general would not accept
an apology. A friend of General Miles
who is quite aware of his attitude told
me to-day that the general felt an of
fense had been committed and that no
apology would atone for it.
General Miles makes no secret of his
belief that General Eagan should be
dismissed from the army for his un
disciplined, unmilitary and ungentle
manly conduct, but for the present he
is determined to leave his vindication
in the hands of the President and Sec
retary of War.
NEW FOOTBALL MATERIAL.
Stanford's Team Will Be Greatly
Strengthened This Year.
STANFORD, Jan. 14.â A rather impor
tant football meeting of old Stanford men
has just been reported. Treasurer Fickert,
at the close of last semester, started East
in search of a football crack for next
year. Three days ago Bliss, Culver,
"Heff" Williams, the old center, and
Treasurer Fickert met in Washington,
D. C. The exact results of this meeting
Cannot as yet be made known, but In all
probability Chamberlain, the crack East
ern player, will be brought West to assist
the cardinal. Chamberlain is known to
be one of the surest men in any Eastern
college and at the Bame time to possess
the raculty of leading and coaching a
team into the best condition. Fickert also
promises to supply Stanford with a line
averaging 210 pounds to the man. With
such a line and the present backs Berke
ley's chances of winning the next event
would be greatly diminished.
NEW GOLD FIELDS.
Dawsonites Bushing to Stake Claims
on Carlisle Creek.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 14.â The Yukon
Midnight Sun has the following of the
stampede to Carlisle Creek:
"Dr. Wills and party of twenty have re
turned from the stampede to Carlisle
Creek, which enters the Yukon seven
miles above Thistle Creek, from the oppo
site side. One Cook, stationed on the
steamer tied up there, was sent out to
do some prospecting. He sunk a hole on
Carlisle creek, six miles above its mouth,
on a favorable bar. A pan of gravel three
feet from the surface yielded several dol
lr.rp. He came to Klondike City and noti
fied Dr. "Wills, and off he and the party
went pell-mell to Carlisle Creek. They
located the first ten claims above and the
second ten below Discovery. The first ten
go to the crown.
"Herbert Macauley of Victoria, with a
party of ten. were met at Stewart on the
full jump for Carlisle Creek."
ADMIBAL SAMPSON A GUEST.
Henry Harrison Scott and Bride Give
a Dinner Party.
NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â Henry Harrison
Scott of San Francisco gave a dinner
party at the Gerard last night. Among
the guests were Admiral Sampson, wife
and daughter. After dinner Mr. Scott and
his bride held an informal reception in
their apartments. Mr. and Mrs. Scott
will make this house their permanent
home.
Cutting His Stick.
To cut his stick, in the sense of going
away In a hurry, has long been a com
mon expression, though it is not heard by
any moans so frequently as it was forty
and fifty years ago. "Hey"s cut his
stick" equals run away. "Now, then, cut
yer stick!" equals be off. In playing
cricket when I was a boy, the record of
runs for each player was notched on a
long stick, and runs were only known as
"notches" in those days. I have seen the
records of bigger matches also recorded
on sticks by means of notches, say, forty
five years ago. â Notes and Queries.

Mrs. Stuckupâ Yes, they are all Import

Mrs. Stuckup (proudly)â They could do

l ; he mise of a California Cripple
Creek seemed to come into view in this
city yesterday, when the Selby Smelting
Works made official returns on a lot of
n-iwlj;" discovered ores from Northern
California and nrben some mining men
RJrired and gave evidence regarding some
remarkable recent developments.
Fi-i'jh the Coffee Creek region and from
a number of recent ore discoveries in it,
distributed over a range of thirty miles,
are -coming really wondrous reports of
gold 'discoveries.
Away up in Coffee Creek, near the head
waters'of the Trinity River, about eighty
; mites from a railroad, in a wild virgin
IVr-egion whore an ax has rarely been heard
, -to. .this, day, some patient prospectors,
" fc'fter long years of grubstake rustling, are

Je those from the headwaters of Coffee
ureek, twenty-five miles fn>m a wagon
Vli 1 n , a ru KÂ«e<i country clothed in its
primeval wilderness and on the divide
wnicn separates the headwaters of the
innlty from those of the Salmon River.
Lnion Creek is a tributary of Coffee Creek
near its head, and along'it the great find
of tellurides has been made.
Amos Hill and his partner located a
'edge, put up a crude arrasta at a cash
cost of 70 cents, and during the early fall
the mule ground out a good deal of gold,
though leas than 40 per cent of the base
ore values was saved.
To make a romantic story short, Hill
got two strange school manns of Napa
to buy out his partner for $500. They are
the Misses Irma and Josephine Rider. The
former teaches at Soda Springs and the
latter in the Napa city schools. Hill says
that they have got back $1600 in cash from
that arastra and have a half interest in
the mine that, it is reported, they have
bonded.
Hill named the mine the Yellow Rose of
Texas. Samples of the ore were recently
sent to the State Mining Bureau for anal
ysis. E. B. Preston, the assayer, who has
been a field deputy of the bureau tot
many years and who has thoroughly ex
plored many times that northern country,
was greatly interested to discover a tellu
ride gold ore new to California and which
he found to be nagyagite, a sulphur tellu
rium of lead and gold.
"It was very rich," says Mr. Preston,
"but as the bureau makes only qualitative
analyses I do not know its value. 1 have
always believed that that was a rich
mining country and I expect to see some
great mines developed in it in time.
As to the value of this new tellurHe
ore, Mr. Hill says that he recently s;
a little over two tons to Selby's for trÂ« it
ment. Packing thirty miles on mules to
Carrville cost a cent a pound. Hauling
lifty-six miles to Redding cost as nmcii
more. Rail charges w< te M 4 a ton, mak
ing $S4 transportation charges alone, lne
cost of mining and the smelting charges
are to be added. Mr. Hill's net receipts
from the lot were $1003. Another smaller
shipment assayed $115" a ton. Other Bam
ples sent to Redding have been reportc-d
to go ay high as JSOOO a ton.
Similar results are reported from the
claim next to Hill's, owned by a Mr. Law
rence of Hopland. The ledge is said to
have been traced for three miles, and R

Within a mile of the Golden Jubilee
mine is the recently located Dewey mine,
controlled by George L. Carr. Mr.
<'.irr is one of the best-known mining men
and capitalists in that part of the coun

near the mouth of Coffee Creek, and owns
well-known mining properties. He asserts
that the Dewey mine is one of the many
rich prospects of that region. Sel

THE ORIGIN OF YANKEE.
An Englishman Wrote in 1777 That
It Was an Indian Word of
Contemptuous Meaning.
Major W. A. Guthrie of Durham, in
addition to being an able lawyer, an
astute politician and an admirable gen
tleman otherwise, is fond of literature |
of the best class. He likes to search
through rare books and papers. Some
years ago, at the sale of the effects of
Borne aged citizen, he bought two rusty- |
looking volumes for a mere trifle along
with other books. On examining the
books he found them to be "Travels j
Thnmgh the Interior Parts of America, j
in a Series of Lectures by an Officer of
the British Army." They are the let- ;
Of Lieutenant Thomas Auburey. I
He was taken prisoner at the battle of ;
Saratoga during the Revolutionary j
war. From there he was sent a pris
oner to Boston, and later was marched
with many other prisoners of the Brit
ish army, who had been captured at
various places, to Charlottesville, Va.
Mr. Jones, a large planter of Virginia,
and a member of the Continental Con
gress, had tendered his plantation and
negro quarters to the Congress for a
prison camp. From this plantation
Auburey wrote many of his letters. All
the prisoners were paroled. This offi
cer spent his time in riding about the
country around Charlottesville. The
tetters were to a friend of his in Eng
land. Later the letters were published
in two volumes and were dedicated to
the Earl of Harrington, Viscount Peter
sham, colonel of the Twenty-ninth
Regiment of Foot. They begin August
8, 1776, and run to October 30, 17-1.
The letters are full of interesting and
instructive reading. In volume 11, page
46, written from Cambridge, New Kn;-, r
land, November 25, 1777, is a history of
the word Yankee. Before the Revolu
tionary war the Virginians called the
New Englanders Yankees; from th< n
to the. civil war everybody that was not
of the Xew England States called the
New Englanders Yankees, and during
the civil war everybody north of the
Mason and Dixon line was called Yan
kee.
As to the word, Lieutenant Auburoy
wrote in 1777: "It may not be amiss
here to observe that the etymology of
this term is derived from a Cherokee
word, Eankke, which signifies coward
and slave. This epithet of Yankee was
bestowed upon the inhabitants oi New
England by the Virginians for not as
sisting them in a war with the Chero
kees, and they have always been in
derision by It. But the name has been
more prevalent since the beginning of
hostilities; the soldiers at Boston used
it as a term of reproach, but after the
affair at Bunker Hill the Americans
gloried in it. 'Yankee Doodle' Is now
their paean, a favorite of favorites,
played in their army, esi war
like as the 'Grenadiers' March.' It is
the loon's spell, the- nurse's lullaby.
"After our rapid successes we "held
Yankees in great contempt, but It
was not a little mortifying; to hear them
piny this tune when' their army
marched down tn our surrender."
Such is the history of i.hp etymology
of the word "Yankee. "âCharlotte Ob

THE SAST FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 3899,
POOR OLD POLAR
BEAR WAS COLD
An Icy MistaKe That Caused the Demise
Of Bruin at the Chutes.
THE frosty or "cold" weather that has prevailed In San Francisco
during the past few weeks caused a great deal of trouble in the Chutes
Zoo. The Chutes people have animals and birds from all kinds of
zones in their menagerie, and the advent of the frost king nat
urally mixed matters up badly. An effort was finally made to
furnish all kinds of weather for the occupants of the cages. In
order to do this three large stoves were installed in the menagerie and kept
stuffed with coal night and day. After the crowds had gone at night the
delicate, thin blooded monkeys were garbed in warm
"sweaters" and the lions protected by horse blankets.
This scheme worked to perfection so far as it went, and
the managers congratulated themselves on their fore
sight and good fortune.
They had one important member of their dumb brute
family that required entirely different treatment. This
Immense fellow, with a coat as thick as the bark on a
redwood tree, did not seem to be satisfied with the
weather conditions ordered by Professor Hammon. It
appeared to be too warm for him and he pined for his
own clime. What the Chutes people did to ameliorate
the sufferings of the Polar bear is best told in the lan
guage of Impresario Phil Hastings :
"We kept (ah on the big bunch of hair from the
Arctic circle," said Phil, "and concluded that the tem
perature was too high for him; that his feet were too
hot, and that the proper caper was to insure his com
fort n.nd safety by putting him on ice and providing an
electric wind blast. This was done. We actually paved
his cage with slabs of the real thing and assured our
selves that we were the only expert Polar bear nurses
in the country.
"Somehow this did not suit; so we piled in more ice
without regard to the matter of expense. Much to our
alarm, bruin began pining at a rate that made us lie
awake nights. Alas, too late, we discovered that we had
made a fatal error. What was the trouble? Why, that
overgrown, perverse, inconsistent product of the Polar regions was cold. We
had done the ice-pack and wind-blast act and he did the restâ laid carefully
down on his slab of ice and died. The weather was too frosty for him."
AN EXHIBITION OF CRIME.
Art Contributes to the Curious Col
lection in the Austrian Capital.
One point of attraction at the Jubilee
Exhibition here is a pavilion which re
veals secrets and mysteries of a kind
which we all lova to hear about. The
Vienna police, in the endeavor to con
vince the public that its only task is
not to bother people and arrest them,
has attempted to make a show of its
duties and aims, the system on which
it works and the "results attained. Ta
bles and figures have been conscien
tiously avoided, and a very pleasant
mode of enlightening the public has
been found. The pavilion has seven
large rooms, which, with a good cata
logue and a very little explanation, give
an insight into a most complicated or
ganization. Forty-two artists of note
have contributed to the police picture
gallery. One has illustrated a touch
ing sceneâ an every-day event in Vi
ennaâof two policemen bringing a
young girl, who has flung herself Into
the Danube, to the shore. A sculptor
has treated the same subject in a mas
terly group. Another artist shows how
a mounted policeman stops runaway
horses, another gives us the. interior of
a police station, where several police
men are amusing a little child who has
strayed and is seated on their table,
contented to see so many kind faces
around. Then there Is an excellent
picture of a fire from which a police
man snatches a woman, another of a
policeman on guard in pelting rain at
night at some desolate point. The po
liceman who has found a babe "laid
away" by its mother makes the most
touching picture of all, perhaps, and
one deciding a quarrel between two
market women the most comical. There
are seventy excellent works of art, il
lustrating the policeman's difficult ca
reer. '
Adjacent to the picture gallery is a
i model office for a police commission â
! in which the newly caught Criminal is
i being examined. Close to the desk is
j the so-called "Criminals' Album"â
which is a good sized cabinet with six
i teen drawers â holding material which
< makes it easy work to recognize the
' man if he is not at his first crime. The
exhibition shows some of the photo
graphs by which criminals are identi
fied. All are natural size. Every man
is taken twiceâ full in the face, and in
sharp profile with his right ear to the
beholder. The exhibition contains hun
dreds of these fine photographs, many
of which show the same man at inter
vals of one year or longer. It must
be admitted that in nine, cases out of
ten the man in one cannot be recog
nized in the other. It is, of course, in
the interest of every criminal who has
been in the hands of the police to
change his appearance as much as pos
sible. But we are shown that two
men can be perfectly alike, so as to
deceive even the cleverest police officer.
These photographs are exhibited to
prove the necessity of anthropometry.
Life sized wax figures illustrate this
interesting system of keeping a record
of criminals. The eleven measurement*
recorded on the card with the criminal's
photograph are here taken before our
eyes.
A policeman's schoolroom is also
shown, with all the material for his
teaching â enlarged photographs of
hundreds of ears, portraits of criminals,
a skeleton, a collection of glass eyes
showing all the colors that exist; then
fifty-eight , wigs to show all the possi
ble colors of hair. An interesting ob
ject is the bap: which a Police Commis
sioner takes with him when he Is called
to the site of a murderâ with micro
scope, magnifying glasses and fifty im
plements, Including a case of strong
cigars in case a disinfectant should be
found indispensable. : ;i ; \
There is, in addition, a collection of
criminal implements seized on the
scenes of murders and burglaries. The
new hammer with which a solicitor's
clerk murdered his master is there, the
hatchet with which a married couple
were. murdered years ago, a piece of a
railway rail with which a lodger killed
his landlady some months ago. Thou
sands of keys, iron bars, tongs, cross
bars and many mysterious implements
are arranged into groups and tableaux.
A most remarkable object Is a steel
contrivance which a suicide made for
himself to be quite, sure of getting the
ball right into his heart, and we are
assured he did not fall. There is a!pr>
â i pistol which an apprentice made with
his own hands and shot himself with.
A large glass case shows how poachers
catch game in the Praterâ pheasants,
wild ducks, hares, partridges and even
a deer Bra caught ir. the slings and
traps and the other contrivances, which
reveals extraordinary powers of inven
tion. The most recent murders are
shown In a series of photographsâ the
victim during the examination by the
physicians, the scene of the murder in
all the terrible disorder, speaking of re
sistance offered, the plcturp of the mur
rlerer. We are promised a practical
demonstration shortly, when a thief
will be caueht in the crowd and taken
to the pavilion, there to be identified
and treated according to his deserts.

COLD BATHS.
Their Injurious Effects Upon the
Anemic and the Old.
The Journal of Topical Medicine
has an interesting article on the use of
the cold tub in tropical countries, in
which it is shown that, health-giving
as it may be to those who are young
and vigorous and newly arrived, it is
by no means a process to be universally
advised. In the tropics a dally bath of
some sort becomes a necessity for pur
poses of cleanliness alone. But the
"tub" which is indulged in by Euro
peans â that is, immersion in cold water,
or, at any rate, water that is distinctly
colder than the body, for say five min
utesâhas a distinct physiological ac
tion besides the removal^ of dirt, and
the question is whether triis is good or
bad. It is pointed out that the shock
is relatively greater than in temper
ate climates, that the abstraction of
heat during the process can be but ill
afforded, and that the depression of
temperature induced is difficult to re
cover from.
It is also insisted on that neither the
circulatory nor the respiratory organs
respond to the stimulus, and that, es
pecially in the case of those who are
"getting on" in years, the digestive or
gans may be congested to a dangerous
extent. We think that all this is very
true, but that it is true for a very large
number of people who live in temper- j
ate climes as well as for those who.se
lives are passed in the tropics. Many
people whe have, as they would say,
been "always accustomed" to take a
cold tub every morning continue the
habit long after it had better have been
given up. They do this partly because
it is a habit and partly because they,
dislike the confession of getting old
which seems to be involved in giving
up the customs of their more youthful
days.
But we are quite clear that unless
good reaction very qulcklv follows a
cold bath, and follows it without much
"toweling," such tubbing is very often
injurious. Whenever a man has to
"rub himself warm." or when he finds
that he is not right again until after
his breakfast he may feel sure that his !
tub is doing him harm, and that he
would do better to take a warm bath,
finishing off with a rapid sponge over
with cold water. "For the young, vig
orous and newly arrived youth in the
tropics the cold bath may be indulged
in with impunity, and it may be with
benefit, but as years lapse the tropical
resident calls for bath water warmer
and still warmer, until he finds that h^
has best health only when the water
of his bath is not below the tempera
ture of his body."
And it is the same In temperate cli
mates. On the one hand the anemia
of the renders a man more sus
ceptible to cold, but, on the other hand,
the arterial rigidity which in temper
ate climates is so common an associate
of advancing years renders men pecu
liarly unable to bear that sudden dis
placement of blood and that sudden re
arrangement of the circulation which Is
Involved In getting into cold water.â

Seeing Bullets as They Fly.
"As every sportsman knows," said
an enthusiastic New Orleans hunter,
"it is easy to see a rifle bullet in the
air, and those fired from the new high
power guns are very curious to look
at. Stand a dozen yards to one side of
the mark and let a friend blaze away
at any range with a small caliber
weapon using smokeless powder, and
you'll see a strange, blufsh white streak
the instant the bullet strikes home.
The streak is apparently a couple of
inches wide and several feet long, and
is more like a flash of light than any
thing else I can think of. With the
old-fashioned Remington or Spring
field carbine the bullet has the ap
peaerance of a long black rod, and I
don't know why there should be such
a difference in the optical illusion pro
duced by the smaller caliber. I have
heard some people deny that the bullet
can be seen, but they are very much in
error. It all depends on getting the
right viewpoint. A few feet either way
will render the missile invisible, but
the right spot is soon found by experi
ment, and after that the thing is as
plain as day."â New Orleans Times-
Democrat.
Carbon Pictures on Celluloid Base.
Carbon pictures, done on heavy paper
or celluloid base?, are one of the recent
novelties in the photographic world. To
day they are made in monochromes of
fourteen different colors, from black to
light blue. Few operators aro skillful
enough to make them well, and most of
the city trade is handled by a few men.
Paper with a coating of gelatine and
carbon on it Is dampened in bichromate
of potash and then dried by a draught of
air in the dark. After drying It Is ready
for exposure. It is placed in contact with
a negative In the usual way, anc> print
ed by sunlight, the time for each negative
being told by a photometer. After print
ing the carbon paper Is soaked In warm
water, and all the unexposed part dis
solved. The paper is then stuck face
downward on tne celluloid base to be
used. A long application to the water
takes the paper off. leaving the picture on
the celluloid. This process requires dry
weather and particular precaution in
handling; its effects are especially fine
when wall executed.â Boston Transcript.

THE QUESTION
OF A TEACHER'S
PAID VACATION
Three Months of Sal
aried Recreation.
WILL THESE PRIVILEGES GO?
MISUNDEBSTANDING AS TO
MONEY ON HAND.
President Bergerot States That No
vember - December Salaries
Will Finally Be
Settled, '
One of the cloud of worries emptied out
of the Pandora box by the young Board
of Bdacation is the November-December
salary question. This "trouble," ex
pressed arithmetically, reads $180,000, run
ning something like an average of $180 to
each teacher for the two months. The
old board intended to issue warrants for
these months, but did not do so, choosing
to leave the educators with the other
army of creditors to comtemplate and
enjoy the deficit en masse. With the late
board it wasâ as with the historically
profligate French monarch viewing the
wrecked treasuryâ "after us, the deluge."
The outside creditors enjoined the de
partment, and the teachers enjoined the
outsiders, and so the preliminary guns of
the battle were fired, and then the first
wave of the "deluge" swept that board
into the black limbo of obliquy. Now,
connected with their injunction suit, there
is a solemn thought buzzing in the minds
of the thinking teachers. It Is the sal
aried vacation matter. For three months
in each year the educators play under
pay. One thousand teachers at $90, multi
plied by three months, amounts to $270,
--000 if there is any honesty in figures. The
Finance Committee of the Board of Edu
cation reported in effect last Wednesday
evening that possibly the actual deficit
would reach $230,381. A recovered fund of
$270,000 would help this indebtedness out
amazingly. Should the court, in working
out their injunction case, decide that
those vacations are only luxuries and not
necessities, and that such luxuries should
not be paid for by the somewhat heavily
burdened taxpayers of the city, that
working folks often pay their own way
when they play, where will the future
vacation privilege be "at"?
It has been mentioned that country
school teachers who are not gifted with
a life-tenure of position, whose labors are
just as arduous and whose remuneration ia
below that of the city educators, have no
salaried Intermission between terms. Said
a country school rnarm recently: "Why
should Mrs. X (whose husband has a fair
Income) draw down $250, which Is five
flchths of my pay for eight months' work,
while recreating at the 'springs,' while
1 am paying for my vacation out of my
own pocket?" The possibility of the en
tire abolishment of the vacation and its
salary by some one of the powers that
be was recently borne in on a mind
or two and an effort was made to stop the
injunction proceedings. But other counsels
prevailed and the case Is yet on.
It is argued by those close to the edu
ucational office that If the board could
bring itself to cut into the work of the
department as instanced by the abolish
ment of the normal and the throwing out
of the evening schools it will not for an
instant hesitate to clip off the play-part
of that work.
President Bergerot yesterday evenlnp,
speaking of the November-December sal
aries, said there existed no intention on
the part of the present board to have the
teachers ilnally lose their pay of these
two months.
"The present board," he contjnued, ''will
discharge every obligation just as rapidly
as it can. Burdened and overburdened
as it is by a mountain of debt piled up
by its predecessors, it is trying to dear
off one by one the load. The classes,
schools and teachers that can be spared
must go that money may be saved. The
Normal School could be spared, as there
are several State Normals and a univer.
sity all running and turning out teachers.
It may be found that all the evening
schools can be spared, and if so every
one will go for the present. The pres
ent board has three lawyers in its ranks
and they have their heads close together
studying up in the law to tit these 'com
ing suits.' And I can srty the board is
all ready, well fortified with decisions and
opinions for emergencies. We will do the
greatest good to the greatest number and
be a decided improvement over our prede
cessors, I fancy.
"To-day the representative of a morn-
Ing paper demanded the names of the al
leged list of teachers who were to be con
solidated out. No such information was
or will be given now, for the reason that
no list is in existence. Some of the news
papers and some of the startled public
have fixed upon a high number of teach
ers who have been virtually dismissed,
but the figures are all wrong.
"In conclusion 1 will say that unless re
calculations are very incorrectâ unless
the School Department remains poverty
stricken, its present conditionâ no teach
er will finally lose his or her November-
December salary, nor will any creditor
for that matter.
"Now, as to the plaint that has been
raised regarding those Normal girls los
ing a half year, etc. Any of those young
ladies who can pass the necessary ex
aminations will receive recognition in the
way of diploma or certificate. They will
not be thrown out on the world to suffer,
half educated and certiflcateless, as cer
tain of their friends fear. All such com
plaints are groundless. Everything the
present Board of Education will do will
be within reason."
The reply of Auditor Asa R. Wells to
the Board of Education regarding the
amount of money at the disposal of the
board for the ensuing six months seems
to have taken the officials by surprise
It is $50,000 less than was expected and
the deficiency is readily explained by Mr
Wells. In the last levy there was a spe
cial approprition of $100,000 for the pay
ment of salaries for June. lÂ£>7. As this
was levied for a special purpose it was
applied to that purpose at once; hence it
is not available now.
Mr. Wells submitted his reply to thÂ©
Board of Education late on Friday and
spent the greater portion of yesterday
morning explaining how he reached his
conclusion in the matter. Directoi H M
Holbrook telephoned him and later' oii
sent his secretary to Interview him on
the matter. As chairman of the Finance
Committee of the board he is deeply in
terested in the amount of money that will
be available for the schools for the ensu
ing six months which will bring the pres
ent fiscal year to a close. Auditor Wells
lias assured the Directors that if his inter
pretation of the matter is not the correct
one the board will lose nothing, as there
is money on hand to make up the 550,000.
The Brave Bull, the Cruel Spaniard.
The trumpet sounds again, and the
espada takes his sword and his muleta
and goes out for the wild scene. This
which ought to be, is not always the reai
climax. The bull is often by this time
tired, has had enough of the sport leaps
at the barrier, trying to get out. He is
tired of running after red rags, and he
brushes them aside contemptuously; he
can scarcely be got to show animation
enough to be decently killed. But one
bull that I saw recently was splendidly
savage, and fought almost to the last
running about the arena with the sword
between his shoulders, and that great red
line broadening down each side of his
neck on the black; like a deep layer of
red paint, one tricks one's self into
thinking.
He carried two swords in his neck, and
still fought; when at last he, too, got
weary, and he went and knelt down be
fore the door by which he had entered,
and would tight no more. But they went
up to him from outside the barrier and
drew the swords out of him; and he got
to his feet again, and stood to be killed.â

GERMAN IN EVENING SCHOODS-
H. J., City. In San Francisco the only
evening school in which the German lan
guage is taught Is the Humboldt.
IN CASE OF WARâ H. D.. City. In
case of war and the necessity for a draft
the military authoritites will not exempt
a man on account of his religion.
A DOLLAR OF 1884â Subscriber, City. J
A silver dollar of 1884 will not bring the
possessor a fortune, as it is not a pre
mium coin. Such can be purchased at an
advance of 50 cents.
IRELANDâ J. M. H., City. The great
est length of Ireland is from Fair Head,
in Antrim, to Crow Head, in Kerry. 306
miles. Its greatest meridional length is
but 225 miles. Its greatest breadth be
twoen the extreme points of Mayo and
Downs is 182 miles, but between Galway
Bay and Dublin it is but 120 miles.
QUARTZ MININGâ G. M., Oakland, Cal.
P. H. Miller, whose name figured in an
article published in The Call recently in
connection with quartz mining in Daw
son, is a man of medium height, middle
aged, somewhat bald and has a sandy
mustache. He was for a time engaged in
mining in Colorado.
MAN AND WIFEâ J. S.. City. Man and
wife divorced in California cannot marry
again in that State within a year from
the time the divorce was granted. There
are those who have been divorced in that
State who have gone into an adjoining
State and married again. A marriage
that is legal In any other State in the
Union is valid in California.
SEX IN THE UNITED STATESâ L.,
Livermore, Cal. Until the census of 1900
Is taken it will be impossible to give figr
ures as to sex in the United States. The
latest figures on that subject are those of
1890, from which it appears that there
were at that time 32,067,880 males and 30,
--654,370 females. The figures for Califor
nia were, 700,059 males and 508,071 females.
EMBEZZLEMENT IN PENNSYLVA
NIAâQ. P. V., City. In the State of
Pennsylvania if a person, acting under a
power of attorney, comes into the pos

cipal and fails to account for it or appro

A CLEAR TITLE-T. C, "Waterford,
Cal. In the absence of an agreement with
the vendor that he r.hall furnish an ab
stract of title to a piece of property, he
is not bound to furnish such abstract; but
it 1b the duty of the intending purchaser
to satisfy himself that all Is correct. If,
however, the vendor offers to give a clear
title, he undoubtedly would be liable in
damages in case the title did not prove
perfect.
ESTATES IN IRELANDâ J. T., City.
If a man is possessed of realty in his own
name in Ireland, on which there are no
conditions as to future disposition, he can
dispose of the same by will to his wife
or in any manner he desires, just as he
would be entitled to do under the laws of
California. She could come into posses
sion of it without having to wait until a
minor child of which he and his wife were
the parents reached its majority.
WALTZINGâ East Street, Oakland, Cal.
It is reasonable to suppose that some, in
making the great circle of a ballroom dur
ing a waltz, may become giddy by reason
of the circular movement in one direction,
consequently the forward or backward
movement may be Indulged in at pleasure
or the couple may go within or without
the great circle or do the reverse as they
may feel disposed. It is the province of
the gentleman to take the lady in all these
changes, which ought to be frequent.
There cannot be a set rule that "waltzers
must reverse when the music changes"
for the reason mat many dancers cannot
reverse.
A WAGON WHEELâG. W., Quincy,
Piumas County. A friend of this depart
ment has kindly furnished the following
in answer to the question "Does ihe top
of a wagon wheel move faster than the
bottom on level ground?"
"That a point on the top of a wagon
wheel travels faster or through more
space than a point on the bottom of the
wheel can be proven by experimenting in
two Ways: (1) When a wagon or buggy
wheel is at rest put one foot on the bot
tom part of the felly or rim and one hand
on the top part. Let the vehicle be moved
ahead a part of a revolution of the wheel,
say one-fourth or less, with foot ana
hand retained on the portions of the rim
where placed, then note the difference of
spaces through which foot and hand have
traveled. (2) Take a circular piece of
pasteboard or thin wood to represent a
wagon wheel. Place It on the floor with
side against the wall. Insert a small pen
cil or marker in top and bottom edges of
the wheel. Then move the wheel one
o'^btii f) f -i -evintion nr sn and have tho
pencils mark the curves through which
n.f.v travel ana note the difference. Of
course, at a uniform rate of travel of a
wheel each and every point in the rim
makes a revolution in the same time, but
moves slower or through less space when
at or near the bottom than when at or
near the top."

THE BRITISH SHIP ANDELANA
CAPSIZES IN TACOMA HARBOR
THE BRITISH SHIP ANDELANA, SUNK WITH HER CREW ABOARD IN TACOMA BAY.
CAPTAIN STAILING
AND SEVENTEEN
MEN DROWNED
Vessel Goes Down at Night During
a Squall and Is Not Missed
Until Morning.
rACOMA, Jan. 14.â Captain Stall- 1 1
ing and seventeen men were I
drowned by the sinking of the I
British ship Andelana during a .
heavy wind storm early this morning, j'
The gale which blew her over was one |
of the most severe experienced here in '
.years. It blew at the rate of thirty- |
eight miles an hour. The Andelana i
was capsized almost instantly and be- jl
fore her officers and crew knew that .
they were in peril.
Yesterday noon a gale sprang up, |
which soon reached thirty miles an |
hour. It gradually subsided until night- j |
fall or the Andelana probably would I
have pulled into a dock. As it was, j I
she remained at anchor in the stream, I .
being pit-vented tipping over only by
heavy log buoys moored on either side i
of her. This was really a dangerous i
position during windy weather, for all 1
of her ballast had been discharged and !
she had taken no stiffening aboard.
There is no doubt that when the ter- ,
rible gale sprang up last night she j â 
partly turned over. This lifted her ! ]
starboard ballast log out of the water j :
and itt- weight caused a defective link ;
to break. Thus released from the log, | '
the ship turned suddenly on her beam
ends, and in another instant the water
was pouring down her hatchways, j '
These were but loosely covered and af- ;
forded no protection. With her toppling j
masts and towering side to give the
gale full swing, the- Andelana went over
as though she were a racing shell.
How the seamen struggled to escape
can be imagined, but without doubt
they had scarcely leaped from their
bunks into the inflowing waters before j
their vessel had struck bottom, twenty- i
three and a half fathoms below the sur
face. This is indicated by the fact that
the vessel did not drift from her moor
ing place, but sank almost at the spot
where she was moored last night.
With daylight this morning tho Ande- â 
lana was missed. Where sin; had been
riding, apparently secure, at dusk last
night there- Bbxrwed but a blank stretch
of waters. Captain Doty of tho ship
Walter EL Wilson was probably the
first i" discover the Andelana'a disap
'.pearance. Hurriedly calling hit; gig l
: crew he was rowed to the tug Fair- i
field,' lying at the Eureka dock. The |
tug was sent across the Andelana's j
anchorage. Not a trace of the missing !
.'ship was to be found. The Fairfield j
then crossed tt? tho eastern :-ide of the
.' bay. Here the Andelana's fate was j
madf evident.
Swamped and with battered gunwale
one of the ship's lifeboats tossed against
the gravelly beach. Further on was
found a ballast log, with a broken chain I
attached. Then were discovered wooden j
shovels such as had been used on the
Andelana. The last piece of wreckage
found was a mattress marked with the
ship's name.
I'll and down the beach Captain Doty
and Captain Hurley of the tug tramped,
but not another vestige of wreckage i
â¢ from the ship was to be found.
â¢ â  It was scarcely believed along the
water front that the ship could have
. sunk without some one escaping or
without being heard by watchmen
aboard vessels at the St. Paul and Ta
. coma Lumber Company's wharf, less
than half a mile away. To make cer
tain of her fate, it was decided to send
the tug Fairfield out with grappling
â¢irons to locate the wreck. At 5 o'clock I
this afternoon a steam launch caught
with grappling irons what seemed to
be a piece of cable. Still later the tug
Fairchild caught hold of some solid
substance.
This was the best that could be ac
complished with grappling irons at a
depth of 141 feet, and is considered
complete evidence that the ship is lying
underneath where she was last seen
anchored. This depth is too great to
permit divers to work with ease. No
attempt has been made to engage
divers pending the receipt of instruc

tions from shipowners or underwriters. I
Shipping men believe the vessel can be j
raised with air bags or by sinking air- |
tight scows and connecting them with |
cables which shall pass beneath the
wreck. The water would then be j
pumped out of the scows, causing them |
to raise.
The bodies cannot be recovered unless I
the vessel be raised. It is believed they |
would be recognizable should the ves
sel be raised several months hence,
since tho ice cold water at the bottom j
of the Sound will tend to preserve
them.
The Andelana was to have loaded
wheat here next week for Queenstown.
Her coming voyage would have com- ;
pleted her trip around the world. She ;
left London about a year ago for New
York, whence she sailed in May for
Shanghai with coal oil. She reached i
there on October 19, and arrived to
Port Angeles seventeen days ago. At j
that time she was erroneously reported j
as being the overdue bark Caradoc. i
Eppinger & Co. subsequently chartered'
her and she reached here this week.
To be absolutely on the safe side. [
Captain Stalling should have taken j
some wheat aboard as stiffening be
fore discharging all his ballast. Wheat !
vessels loading here and at Portland.
however, have been in the habit of re- |
lying only upon the less expensive log i
system of ballast during the interim be- j
tween discharging ballast and loading, j
Capt. Stailing expected to be towed to j
his loading berth to-day. Possibly he had j
some apprehension of danger by wind, ;
for last evening he declined an invita- |
tion to dine and spend the night ashore,
saying his place was aboard his ship.
Twelve men left the ship on Wednes- j
day. The next day ten of them shipped I
on the ship Dirigo for Queensto-wn. j
Apprentice Buck was sent to the hos- j
pital for an operation, and to that fact ;
he owes his life. This reduced the crew ,
to eighteen, of whom not one escaped.
Captain Stailing had been the Ande
lana's master but one year. He had ex
perienced the usual troubles at sea
during his twenty-two years as mas
ter, becoming captain at 20 years of
age, but it remained for the ballast
logs of the Andelana, his empty vessel I
and a heavy squall to mar his record
and send him to the sailors grave.
The Andelana line has become known
for ill luck among shipmasters and un- j
derwriters. A few years ago the An- I
drina went ashore on Vancouver Island. !
It cost $12,000 to clear her of the rocks, i
Subsequently the Andera, bound from \
the sound to South Africa, was lost at \
sea. Then came the Americano, .which,
being out 100 days from Hongkong to â 
the sound, her owners paid 70 guineas
reinsurance on her only to have her j
turn.. up safe and sound.
Captain Staillng's home was Annapo
lis, Nova Scotia, where his widow and
three children live. He had been mas
ter of the ships Truro, ColchesteV, Sa- |
vona nnd Andorhina.
HISTORY OF THE ANDELANA.
The four-masted steel ship Andelana
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SITS DAY, JANUARY 15, 1899.
was built in ISB9 at Workington, Eng
land, by R. Williamson & Son. She
was of 2395 tons net burden, 303.7 feet
long, 42.2 feet broad and 24.6 feet deep.
She was owned by the Andelana Sail
ing Ship Company (E. F. and W. Rob
erts) of Liverpool and was well known
I in this port.
The Andelana left Shanghai for Puget
| Sound on November 11 last and while
I several vessels have been wrecked and
â  heavy reinsurance is being paid on
others from that port, she made the
run in the fast time of forty-eight daya
to Port Angeles. From there she was
taken to Tacoma, where she anchored
on the sth inst. Captain G. W. Stall
ing, who was in command of the Ande
lana, was not known on this coast. He
was a Nova Scotian and took command
of the vessel last year. He leaves a
widow and thre<=> children.
The Andelana was last in San Fran
cisco in July, 1897. She was then in
command of Captain Gillis, and on
July 22 of that year sailed for Queens
town with a cargo of wheat. She was
not on this coast again until she came
over in ballast from Shanghai.
ALONZO'S TROOPS ARE
DEFEATED BY REBELS
Bolivia's Revolution Spreads and
Foreign Consuls Have Decided
to Act as Mediators.
LIMA. Peru, Jan. 14.â Reliable advices
from Bolivia say that General Caceres
is detained at L'yuni by order of Presi
dent Alonzo.
According- to the same advices General
Camacho. the head of the Federalist
troops, left La Paz with 2000 men and has
token up a position at Qtienoo. two
leagues from La Paz, on the heights of
the road to Oruro.
President Alonzo's troops were out
flanked by tho Federalists and his ad
vance guard was defeated.
The foreign Consuls at La Paz have de
cided to act as mediators between the
Government troops and the insurgents
with a view to averting bloodshed.
RAIN AT STOCKTON.
San Joaquin Valley Receiving An-
other Mild Wetting.
STOCKTON, Jan. 14.â Another welcome
: rain reached this county last night, and
I continued throughout the night, the pre
cipitation amounting to .34 of an inch
here. The ground is now in condition to
stand a long dry spell, and good crops are
already assured.
BALLARD, Jan. 14.â As a result of the
recent storm, farming operations have
been resumed throughout the Santa Ynez
i Valley. Cattlemen are preparing to re-
I stock the great ranges with animals that
I had been driven to Northern California
; pastures, and orchard cultivation will
proceed in the old-fashioned way. The
San Rafael Rangp, forming- the south
boundary of the Zaca Lake and Pine
Mountain reserve, is now covered with
snow down to the valley foothills, insur
ing good feed on the reservation and
plenty of water in the valley streams.
Colonization of Negroes.
CHATTANOOGA, Tcnn., Jan. 14.â An
application was made to-day by S. J.
Hutchins, J. E. Patton and other lending
colored citizens of this city for. a charter
for the National American Colonization
Association, the object being to organize
branches in the Southern States. The
association is formed with a vjew to eol
nnizing negroes in the West and s.curinir
from Congress a concession to allow col
onies so formed the right of State gov
ernment and representatives in Cinq.-ess
etc. The plan was originated by S j'
Hutchins, a negro lawyer of this tity'
Hutchins gives as a reason for his pro
posed colony "that the people of the
United States should be given an oppor
tunity to see whether the negro is capable
of governing and holding office."

WHY IRELAND IS
CALLED TO ROME
Leo XIII Wants Some
Explanation.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9?, by James Gor
don Uenpett.
ROME, Jan. 14.â With regard to the
visit of Mgr. Ireland, which has caused
so much speculation on both sides of
the Atlantic, I am now in a position to
give some interesting particulars.
Archbishop Ireland, it appears, has at
different times and occasions put him
self forward and made known to the
Pope that he was on very friendly
terms with President McKinley and had
considerable influence with him.
The Pope, wishing above all things
to preserve peace as far as he pos
sibly could, and to do everything in his
power to avoid the Spanish-American
war, naturally was much impressed by
the ambitious and, to say the leas', too
sanguine Archbishop, hence those over
tures which are now historical on th^
part of the Vatican to arrange the
Cuban question on some friendly basis
satisfactory to both parties.
These questions of Intervention, of
bringing about an armistice and other
overtures gave rise to prejudice and to
outspoken opposition in America to the
so-called "clerical influence."
Certain it is that if the Pope made
any great efforts at intervention they
signally failed, and it appears, and is
not to be wondered at under the cir-
eumstanees, that the Vatican is much
displeased at having made overtures
which only invited refusal on the part
of the President to accept them.
Archbishop Ireland is therefore sum
moned to Rome to explain his action in
undertaking to guide the Vatican on
what appears to have been such insuf
ficient grounds for success. .
But this is not all. The question of
a division between the American party,
which is united to the clerical party of
Canada, on one hand, and the Jesuit
party on the other, will be inquired
into. The American party, which ac
knowledges the leadership of Mgr. Ire
land and Cardinal Gibbons, is supposed
to be in sympathy with French influ
ence, if any, while the Jesuit party is
supported by German}-.
Treaty With the Cherokees.
ST. LOUIS. Jan. 14.â A special to the
Republic from Muskogee, I. T., says: The
treaty between the United States and
Cherokee nations was signed by the com
mission here to-night. Sargy Sanders and
John Gunter, two members of the Chero
kee committee, refused to sign the treaty.
To become effective the treaty must be
ratified by Congress on or before March
i, In!>9, and by a majority vote of the
Cherokee people.
LARGEST STEAMSHIP
EVER CONSTRUCTED
Launching of the Oceanic, a Vessel Weigh=
ing Half as Much Again as the
Great Eastern.
BELFAST, Jan. 14.â The White Star steamship Oceanic, the largest
steamship ever built, was successfully launched at Harland & Wolf's
yard to-day in the presence of an enormous crowd.
A grand stand was erected to accommodate 5000 people. Among
those present were the Duke and Duchess of Abercorn, Lord and Lady
Dufferin, the Marquis and Marchioness of Londonderry, the Earl of
Shrewsbury, the Earl of Ava, the Earl of Shaftesbury, Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach and the Lord Mayor of Belfast.
The Oceanic, unlike the Great Eastern, which was launched broad
sMe, was launched stern foremost, though longer and weighing half as
much again as the Great Eastern.
The Oceanic has a coal capacity sufficient to enable her to cir
cumnavigate the globe at a speed of 12 knots an hour without re
dialing.
She is 704 feet long (24 feet longer than the Great Eastern) and
has a gross tonnage of about 17,000 tons. To walk from her bow to
her stern means a stroll of SOO yards.
The Oceanic, though owned by a private company, has been built
in accord with Admiralty requirements as a merchant cruiser, etc.
HAWAIIAN COURT
REVERSES ITSELF
Chinese Petitioners Re-
fused a Landing.
JUDD RULING SET ASIDE
ASIATICS REMANDED BACK TO
THE COLLECTOR'S CUSTODY.
Chief Justice Files a Dissenting Opin
ion Opposing the Stand
Taken by the
Majority.
HONOLULU, Jan. 7.â A decision filed
fey the Supreme Court yesterday in the
last batch of Chinese habeas corpus
cases disagrees from the former opin
ions oi" Chief Justice Judd, and reverses
the situation completely. In other
words, the Chinese petitioners, who
claimed the right to land in Hawaii by
virtue of certain permits issued to them
prior to annexation, are remanded back
to the custody of Collector McStocker,
to be deported or disposed of as Agent
Brown may elect.
The opinion is by Justice Pefry, and
the opinion is concurred in by Justice
Whiting. Chief Justice Judd signs a
dissenting view, adhering to the opin
ion put forward at the hearing decided
on December 15. Judge Perry's opinion
is very long and embraces a vast deal
of matter. The following is declared
in it:
The joint resolution passed by the Con
gress of the United States on July ti, lfs'JS,
relating to the annexation of the Ha
waiian Islands, provided, inter alia, that
there shall be no further immigration of
Chinese into the Hawaiian Islands, except
upon such conditions as are now or may
hereafter be allowed by the laws of the
United States.
Held, that by virtue of this provision
the United States laws relating to the im
migration and exclusion of Chinese were
extended to and put in force in the Ha
waiian Islands, and are no\y in this coun
try; and further, that Chinese, whether
residing In this country or not prior to
July 7, 1898, to whom permits to enter the
Hawaiian Islands were issued prior to
said date by the Hawaiian Government,
are not excepted by the resolution from
the operation of said United States laws,
but are also subject to the provisions
thereof.
This court is not a court of the United
States and has no jurisdiction, in habeas
corpus proceedings or otherwise, to pass
upon the validity of the appointment of
a Federal officer, or the extent of his
powers under Federal laws, or the legal
ity of the detention by him under such
laws of persons who claim to be illegally
in such custody.
The opinion opens with the papers in
the case, and the particulars of the
view follow. Summing up, the Judge
says :
This statement of the law is clear and
to the point. If in this case there is any
defect in the power of the United States
officer or in his mode of proceeding it is
for the tribunals of the I'nited States to
revise and correct it, and not for this
court. That no United States court has
been established here yet, and that groat
Inconvenience may result from this court's
holding that it has no jurisdiction, cannot
of itself confer jurisdiction upon the
court. The Hawaiian Government had
not and has not the power to confer upon
this court jurisdiction to construe or ju
dicially enforce United States laws, and
the United States Government, though
possessing the power to confer such jur
isdiction, has not yet done so. For such
failure and the inconvenience resulting
therefrom Congress alone is responsible.

The Tacoma brings 111 mules and a
large quantity of quartermaster and
commissary stores for Honolulu /and
Manila. The mules will be left here and
the horses and mules brought on the
previous trip will be taken on to
Manila. The Tacoma will remain here
for about ten days. \
The Bennington was taking on stores
to-day for her long cruise by way of
Wake Island and Guam to Manila. One
of the most significant things that went
aboard to-day was a seventy-foot cedar
pole, from which the American flag will
float over Wake Island. The Benning
ton sailed this afternoon.
President Dole did not receive a call
to Washington by the last mail.
"I hardly think now that I will go,"
said Mr. Dole this morning, "for the
reason that the committee work is fin
ished and there seems hardly any
necessity for my making the long trip."
DISASTER ON THE SOLANO.
PORT COSTA, Jan. 14.â Two cars loaded
with coal, while being switched on to the
large ferry steamer Solano this morning,
broke loose from the engine and crashed
through the blocks on the tnd of the
steamer, one car going overboard out of
sight into the bay. while one-half of the
Becond car dropped on to the end of the
boat, another half remaining on the
tracks.
The coal was for the use of the Solano,
being placed so that it could be unloaded
into the steamer's bunkers. The hoat be
ing higher in the center where the coal j
bunkers are, the cars had a good start |
and could not be stopped after breaking |
away. The wrecking crew was on its
way to Oakland from Ingomar with the j
wrecked Owl train, and being here at the
time of the accident was called upon to
remove the sunken car, the tide being
high until this evening. It is expected
the Solano can pass over the sunken car
all right and transfer passenger trains
without delay. .
No one was injured, but two men were
on the cars at the time setting the hand
brakes, and only escaped being carried
along by jumping from the runaway
cars.
MRS. WALTERS
WILL NOT TALK
Throws No Light on the
Napa Tragedy.
MAY SOON HAVE TO TESTIFY
WILL BE A WITNESS AT THE
PRELIMINARY HEARINGS.
Her Knowledge of the Killing of
Cook May Be Used Against Mc-
Kenzie, but Not Against
; Her Husband.
Sueclal Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA. Jan. 14.â While little of mys
tery now attaches to the part Jesse
Walters and ex-Sheriff McKenzie took
in the slaying of Alfred Cook, Mrs.
Walters remains the sphinx of the sit
uation. Neither friend nor foe has
been able to break through her barri
cade of "I don't care to answer." "I
have no statement to make at this
time." "I will neither affirm nor deny
anything."
Among the questions which she could
answer, to the advancement of justice,
are: Whether she in reality sought
employment for Cook with Mc-
Kenzie; whether she wrote to Cook to
j come to Napa; whether she had knowl
edge of the man hunt by her husband
and McKenzie, with Cook as the game,
! and whether she knew what her hus
; band's purpose was in hunting down
her alleged lover.
Under the protection which the laws
I extend over the relations between man
; and wife, neither can be compelled to
| testify against the other, nor can one
testify against the other, even if will
ing to do so, if objection is made by the
one on trial. So Mrs. Walters cannot
be made a witness in the proceedings
against her husband.
In the case of McKenzie, however,
the way is open to place Mrs. Walters
under examination. McKenzie will be
tried on the charge of murder in the
first degree, as having aided and abet
ted in the killing of Cook, and, accord
ing to the Supreme Court of this State,
Mrs. Walters can be used as a witness
against McKenzie, even should her tes
timony inplicala her nusband. Such
testimony, however, could not be used
against her husband, and so far as
Walters is concerned would count for
nothing against him.
It is the expressed purpose of District
Attorney Bell to place Mrs. Walters on
the stand, as he is particularly anxious
to clear several matters which he has
not yet made public.
Among the effects of Cook now in
possession of the Sheriff are a number
of letters, one presumed to have been
written to him by Mrs. Walters, in
forming him of the situation open for
him in the stable of McKenzie.
The point which the prosecution de
sires to establish is the genuineness of
this letter. It would cause no surprise
lif it proved to be a forgery. But should
I it be acknowledged by Mrs. Walters the
; prosecution will seek to learn whether it
was written in good faith by Mrs. Wal-
I ters, or whether she was deceived or
I possibly coerced into writing it.
Another damaging bit of evidence
! that will be produced later is that Cook
was known to have possessed a 38
--caliber revolver, but not a 32-caliber,
! such as was found in the box-stall.
i The preliminary hearings will have
! much of fresh interest besides these
matters, as the prosecution has con
siderable evidence that it deemed un
advisable or unnecessary to -roduce be
fore the coroner's inquest. '

MURDER LONE PROSPECTORS

The Trib? Has a Grudge Against the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. Jan. 14.â After a terribly
rough pat-sage from Lynn Canal the
steamer Amur arrived this morning
with a number of late comers from
Dawson and tht trails. Those from
Skaguay bring n-^ws that the Indians
in the neighborhood of Porcupine Creek
are very aggressive and are reported
to have murdered a number of lone
prospectors. A. J. Plantag, a recent
arrival at Skaguay from the new
American gold fields, says in the
Skaguay Alaskan that the . Siwashes
there are very insolent, and whenever
they catch a prospector alone they
make him "divvy" on "grub" and other
supplies, and if he objects they take
what they want through force of num
bers.
He tells of two men who had pro
ceeded up the Alsek River on a pros
pecting tour having been robbed by a
band of about twenty young bucks.
The prospectors camped one night <>n
the river bank, some thirty miles above
Haines Mission. No gign of Indiana
was apparent, but suddenly from the
surrounding brush there appeared a
gang of Siwashes, who immediately
proceeded to overhaul the pair's ef
fects and demanded to be given some
of them. To pacify the horde a great
amount of supplies was yielded up. The
Indians then went away.
The balance of the prospectors' sup
plies was taken far up a gulch and hid
den, because they expected the raid
would be repeated. After a two days'
stop In their camp they wont up the
gulch to get their hidden supplies, in
tending to proceed up the river. But
Indians had stolen everything. There
was nothing to do but turn about and
make for a base of supplies.
It is said that the mysterious disap
pearance of many prospectors going
into that country is laid at the door
of these Indians. Mr. Plantag says
that many have been murdered in the
wilds of that land. The tribe dwelling
there is the most insolent of all In
dians of the far north and claim to
have a grievance against th" white man
because some years ago "Jack" Dalton
taught them a lesson in honesty. He
is said to have shot some who were
stealing from a cache. Since then they
let his stuff alone. However, they have
taken several shots at him and declare
they will make him bite the dust.
In the meantime, Indian fashion, they
seek vengeance on any unprotected
prospector who ventures into that sec*
tion.

BROUGHT HOME A DOG
WITH A BROKEN HEART
WHEN the Astor Battery arrived in this city yesterday the boys
brought with them a little four-footed friend around whose life
hangs a pathetic little tale of real life which sounds almost like
fiction. The animal is just an ordinary little scraggy fox terrier
bearing the unpoetlc name of Boojum, but if ever dog suffered from a
broken heart Boojum was that dog.
He was originally the property of Â£ I Major Holme? of the Astor
Battery. When the battery was organize-! in New York the major did not
want to part from his lively little canine friend, and accordingly took him
along as a mascot. Everybody petted the little fellow. He was lively and
intelligent, as all his breed are. and any one who would hurt Boojum would
be called to account speedily.
When the battery shipped for Manila Boojum was the life of the ship.
When everybody else was suffering from the dreaded mal-de-mer Boojum
was skipping merrily around the d*--k, wasging his stump of a tail and
happy as a clam at" high water. The sight of him cheered the weary ones,
and he caused many a laugh.
But it was at Manila that the little dog distinguished himself; it was
at Manila that his master fell, and it was at Manila that the joy went out
of thr- heart of the faithful pet.
During the battle, when death and destruction was flying In the air.
Boojum. lik^ his master, was in the heat of the battle. The whole thing
seemed a nay's sport for the dog. He cavorted, barked merrily, and when
a bullet would stir up .1 little cloud of dust near him would make a rush for
it and bite up a mouthful of earth.
Then came th<- change. Somebody missed Major Holmes and his dog.
After the battle they found them together. The major lay stiff and cold in
death and his pet. his mascot Boojum. stood by his side, licking the cold
face of his master and whining piteously . They took the body
away and the dog slunk silently after it, giving vent occasionally to a
piteous, half-human cry of grief.
When the major was buried it was thought that the dog would die of
grief. Day after .-' on the grave and would not be comforted.
When the regiment finally left he was with great difficulty coaxed aboard
the transport, but has never be* n known to ft 'lie or give vent to his merry
bark since the Spanish bullet robbed him of his master.

NEWS OF~ THE WEEK
IN YACHTING CIRCLES
The San Francisco Yacht Club has at !
last removed its "ways" from the yard of
Menotti, at North Sausalito, and has re
built them in an improved manner upon J
the shore of. Hurricane Guieh. between .
the Walhalia and the quarters of the Pa- '
cific Yacht Club. The club has acquired
from E. \V. Hopkins two handsome cedar j
Japstreak rowboats, which may be used ,
by -members for rowing .excursions on the
bay. They are eighteen feet long, and i
will carry seven or eight people com- ,
fortably.
On Wednesday evening a meeting of the
San Francisco Yacht Club was held at
the Merchants' Exchange. There will be
several changes in the board of directors.
Recording Secretary Charles B. Hill has
sent in his resignation, as his work is
likely to call him away from the city sev
eral times during the year: Vice Commo
dore G. T. S. \\ bite will decline re-elec
tion, and Treasurer K. B. Hogue expects
to return to Australia about May. It is

BRAVED INFECTION IN
THE NAME OF HUMANITY
DR. TILLMAN CARES FOR A VA-
RIOLOID PATIENT.
It Was Thought to Be a Case of
Smallpox, but Investigation
Proved Otherwise.
What was suspected to be a case of
smallpox caused considerable flurry at the
health office yesterday and elicited nota
ble heroism on the part of an interne.
Word was brought to the health of
ficials that a well defined case of the
dread disease existed at a Post street
lodging house. Investigation proved that
a young man named Tully, Just arrived
from the south, had become alarmed
while on the train by the appearance of
blotches on his person, and since his ar
rival in the city had grown rapidly sick,
while the rush continued to spread. The
case was diagnosed as varioloid. but
Health Inspectors Crow and P.e^amin
were ordered to take art precautions by
burning carpets, furniture, etc.. in the
young man's room, which was also thor
oughly fumigated.
\oung Tuiiy himself was removed to
the Twenty-sixth Street Hospital. Here
Dr. Tillman, an Interne of the City and
County Hospital, nobly volunteered to go
and remain, giving the- sick man all the
medical attention possible and braving
possible
Baseball at Recreation Park.

This will close the season of professional
baseball. The new season will see many
changes in the personnel of the teams,

Our Beloved Mr. Pickwick.
If Mr. Pickwick i* not a gentleman (of
course, not in the heraldic sense), who is?
Who was ever more courteous and con
â¢te and (despite Mrs. Bardell and the
lady in yellow curl papers) more blame
leys in his relations with women? Who
more gayly put himself in peril to rescue
virtue in distress I Who was more fiery
on the point of honor, even if his attitude
of self-defense was unscientific? In whom
â  mark a hand more open, a heart
murr ti r.uer or more eager ro forgive?
Indeed, Mr. Pickwick seems "scarce other
than my own ideal knight," though "a
knight sin amor," like the good Earl
Marlschal. His foibles are amiable; his
scutcheon Is white as the pennon of Brian
Tunstal. He did not shun the bowl; nor
did Socrates, who, to be sure, like Dr.
Johnson, had the stronger head. These
isea of the Piekwickians are to be
taken in a Pickwickian sense; they are
as symbolical as Maeterlinck, and infi
nitely more entertaining.
As to the method or plot, Pickwick has
none, and needs none. It is not a novel,
but something far better; it is Pickwick,
the breviary of kindly men. "Delightful
Look:" as Thackeray cries when Dugald
Dalgetty's name comes into his mind.
"To think of it is to want to jump up and
take it down from the shelf." It opens to
v.- a world literally crowded. with human
beings, of whom the least important even
ar>- permanent creations, friends whom
we do not forget.â Andrew Lang in The
Fortnightly Review.
A Murderer's Suicide.
The suicide in New Zealand the other
day of Louis Charms recalls the tragic in
cident of which he was the central tigmre
some years ago. A neighbor of Chemis,
near Wellington, was found murdered. He
had been shot at close range with an old
fashioned muzzle-loader, and a piece of
newspaper that had been used for wad
ding was found in the wound. The news
paper itself was subsequently discovered
In chpmis' house, and he was in the end
convicted of murder and sentenced to
death. A few days afterward the counsel
who defended him fell ill of typhoid and
died. He had shown signs of illness dur
ing the trial, and a feeling got abroad
that, owing to this fact, the convict had
not been thoroughly well defended. He
was reprieved, and -"-ears later, on the
occasion of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee,
he was liberated entirely. Nobody would
employ him. and the other day he bought
a dynamite cartridge, put it in his mouth,
lit the fuse, and blew off his head.âLon

Sikh Regulations.
A Bet of regulations, intended to dis
tinguish the Sikhs Irrevocably from those
around them, was the rule of the Five
Kakkas. Every Bikh must have with him
five things beginning with the letter k,
viz.: Kesa (long hair), kangha (a comb),
karada (a knife), kirapana (a sword) and
kacha (breeches reaching to the knee).
The purpose of these rules was that every
Sikh should avoid shaving, as do Moham
medans and Hindus, and should be con
stantly armed and free from the long gar
ments* that might impede him in a fight.â

Corsine a Clever Colt.
The coat of Hugh Penny shone like the
surface of an imported plate mirror and
the old champion failed to show his years
as he faced the barrier at Ingleside yes
day, favorite for the Sari Rafael Selling
stakes. With him reposed the hopes and
considerable available capital of the Sat
urday crowd. Of the other three pieces
of racing hardware opposed to Penny,
Joe Ullman looked the sturdiest and was
a heavily played second choice. The duel
between the two proved a great one, as
Batsuma and Topmast cut a very small
figure. Tht^ start was made in front of
the stand and Turner immediately Balled
off in front with the favorite. Well into
the back stretch Rutter. astride Jo*' I'il
man, drew up on equal terms with 1'â¢
and the pair raced head and head ;
far turn. Here possibly Rutter made an
error. Instead of keeping the first choice
pinned to the rail, compelling him t"

forced his mount to the front. "\Vh.
stretch was reached Turner turned
and getting the dry footing was ena
in a drive to lead r'llman past the

popular one and in all likelihood the best
horse won. Satsuma disposed of Topmast
for third money.

knocking at the door, ran a dangerously
close third. .
An eU-nv-nt of luck probably ngur<
the win of Corsine, odds on choice for the
six furlong sprint for thr~<Â»-year-olds. The
Corrigan colt was slow to get in motion,
and for a time it looked as if the black
filly Sombre would â¢"roll in." At the

wide turn threw the race away, enabling
Corslne to win handsomely. Th

A Â£250 Bird.
AUCKLAND. Xov. 16. -Some few weeks
ago, at Lake Te Ar.au. at the back of the j
I We?t Coast Sounds, an exceedingly rare
i birdâ a species of water henâ known aa i
i the Notornia Mantr-lli, was captured.
Only four specimens have yet been seen.
In Maori it is called Takahe. In siz-> it is
like a goose. The breast is a beautiful rich ;
dark blue. The feathers of the back, â¢
j wings and tail are olive green, with an
| almost metallic luster in certain lights;
below the short tail the feathers are pure
white.. The powerful beak is a great
equilateral triangle of hard pink horn.
With one angle directed forward. At the
Upper side is- a bright red band, likje an
attempt at a "'comb." only transversely
placed. The Notornis is of heavy gait,
unable to fly. It exists nowhere else in
j the world except in the South Island of
, New Zealand. Tho name "Notornia Maxi
j telli" was bestowed by Sir Richard Owen
i on a fÂ»-w fossil bones dlscd-vered in the
North Island, viz.: a part of a skull, a
I jaw and a leg bone. Differences between
I the fossil forms and the living species
j havo Induced Dr. Meyer, as a result of
I measurements, to give the name "Nortor
! nip Hochstetteri" to the living bird. The
first specimen was captured in 1R49, and
ita stuffed skin is in the British Museum,
whf-re the second, caught in ISSI, is also
preserved.

French Republics.
Talking to Mint de Mellto at Monto
belo in July, 1797, Napoleon, fresh from
his Italian triumphs, thus enunciated his
views of the Jacobin doctrines and their
professors: "Do you imagine that 1 tri
umph in Italy in order to aggrandize tho
pack of lawyera who form the Directory?
What an idea! A republic of 30,000.000 men!
And with our manners and vices!
How is it possible? That is a
fancy of which at present the
French are full, but it will pass away,
like all the others. .What they want is glo
ry and gratified vanity, but as for liberty
they do not understand what it means."
It is not Strange that tne pu'rcinc: eye
of Napoleon should have seen the glaring
discrepancy between Jacobin theory and
practice, though it may seem strange that i
he should have uttered his views to a
comparative stranger at the time when l
be was posing aÂ« citoyen general," "one '
of Plutarch's men," but the frankness !
of Bonaparte, like the frankness of Bis
marck must at tim.-s have surprised his
contemporaries. That his views were
sound politically there are. perhaps, few
â who would now dispute. "What is the an
swer that would be, given by most think
ing people to 1 the Tgrave question pro
pounded by M. Renan : nearly ten years
ago as to the success of the French Rev
olution? Probably it would be found to i
coincide with that of Pitt rather than
that of Fox, but the lapse of a century
is only, just enabling us to judge with tol
erable impartiality of its effects.âCorn

ARE YOUR
LUNGS WEAK?
To Every Sufferer from Coughs, Grip, Consump-
tion and Similar Signs of Lung Weak-
ness a Great Specialist Offers His
New Scientific
TREATMENT FREE,
Nearly everybody you meet will feel
( insulted if you say they have weak
\ lungs. All seem to have a solid faith
I in the soundness of their own breath-
; ing machine. They maj admit they
have a "heavy cold," "a touch of bron-
chitis," or even "a spell of asthma,"
I but as to weak lungs, NEVER. Even
! the poor consumptive, who scarcely
j speaks without eouglung, whose cheeks
I are wasted, hollow, and bear the hectic
i !lu?h of doom, will assure you that he
| will be all right when the weather
' changes.
How many a poor bread-earner there
is who keeps on and on at his daily
1 toil, taking cough medicines "by fits and
; starts, but never quite curing his cough,
\ while this same cough is but a symptom
i of decay that is eating into his lungs,
i and will in time cause their destruction.

THE TREATMENT THAT HAS NEVER YET FAILED.
Thus does a wife observe her hus-
band, or parents witness the struggle
of a darling child, while no steps are
taken to battle with the evil until con-
sumption has seized on one more vic-
tim. It is terrible to think how far we
may be guilty by our indifference to the
lung troubles of those near and dear to
us. It is also terrible to think that we
may possibly hug a similar dangerous
delusion as to our own health until too
late to obtain a remedy.
Let us leave the distressing subject
to come to what ia practical.
Lung troubles don't move backward.
Weak lungs must be healed and
strengthened and rid of the very earli-
est germs of disease or you are simply
committing a form of suicide. Either
you must cure your lung troubles or
THEY WILL KILL YOU. That's th^
CIVIL SERVICE
AND THE CENSUS
House Committee Hears
League Views.
SELECTION OF SUPERVISORS
IT IS URGED THAT COMPETITIVE
EXAMINATION IS NEEDED.
No Advantage Could Be Obtained by
Making Appointments Un
der the Bi-Partisan
System.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON*, Jan 14.âRepresen
tatives of the Civil Service League ap
peared before the House Census Com
mittee to-day and argued against any
bill which contemplated having ap
pointments made outside of the civil
service.
F. L. Siddons made the first ad
dress. He insisted that the Civil Ser
vice Commission would have all the
eligibles sufficient to make all the ap
pointments wanted in Washington.
He said that the supervisor* should bo
selected by competitive examination
under the direction of the Civil Service
Commission. He did not think it would
be practicable to have the enumerators
so selected, for supervisors under the
protection of the civil service would se
lect the enumerators without regard to
political considerations and solely with
a view to their ability. The clerks in
Washington should also be under the
civil service.
William Reynolds of Baltimore, who
followed, said that the appointments,
unless placed under civil would
practically be made by Senators and
Representatives, and supervisors so se
lected would make appointments of
enumerators under the direction of the
Senators and Representatives. He did
not think it would be of any advantage
to have appointments made from both
parties under a bi-partisan system, as
there would still be politics brought in,
to the detriment of the serfce.
"Scarcely any one has a good word !
for the last census," he said. "More
complaints were made of the last cen- â .
sus than of any previous census. The
general complaint was that men em- i
ployed were not efficient."
Heatwole asked if these complaints j
whole situation in a nutshell.
Never was there any positive cure- for
lung troubles until Dr. Slocum made the
discovery which is now embodied in his
new system of treatment. It cures
weak lungs, bronchitis, asthma, coughs,
consumption, catarrh and every other
ailment of the pulmonary region. It
destroys every germ that can affect the
respiratory system, and even in. ad-
vanced stages of lung trouble positively
arrests the tubercular growth, while it
also builds up the patient so that hi 3
system is enabled to throw off â  scrofula,
rheumatism and other diseases. Thou-
sands of cured cases already prove
these statements. Thousands of grate-
iple bless the discoverer.
The system consists of three remedies
which act simultaneously and supple-
ment each other's curative action.,
Every first-class druggist dispenses
the Slocum System of Treatment in
large original packages, with full direc-
tions for use.
The doctor wants everybody to know
the merits of his system. He has ar-
ranged to give a free treatment (three
bottles of medicine) to all who will ap-
ply to him in person or by letter. Full
instructions for use accompany each
treatment. Surely, if you have weak
lungs you will be glad to take advant-
age of a scientific treatment that ia
offered in such a generous spirit.
Write to Dr. T. A. Slocum, 93 Pine st..
New York City, giying full address, and
please tell him you read this in The
Call.
Delay only makes your trouble

could not be traced to poor pay, and
Reynolds said he thought not. be
cause there were few complaints of
previous censuses and he supposed
there was not much different tn the
pay of the last and other censuses.
Pigs and Witchcraft.
Two women of thr lower class wen
quarreling violently the other evening in
Heavitree. a suburb of Kxeter. One yelled
to the other, "You wretch, you always
keep a black and a white pig so th, â  you
can witch us; you ought to be scragged"'
The one so addressed, it seems, has lived
in her cottage some twenty years. She
has during this period, it is said, always
kept a couple of pigs, one of each color,
Tind her neighbors consider she does this
so that she may enjoy the very, quesi
able powers of witchcraft.- No butcher
i in the neighborhood will buy her pig's,
as, if he was known to do so. he would
', certainly lose the local custom, upon
which he relies.â Notes and Queries.

TO BRING HOME THE
FIRST CALIFORNIA
FRIENDS OF THE BOYS CIRCU
LATING A PETITION.
It Asks for a Return of the Regiment
and the Substitution of An
other Should It Be
Necessary.
Anxious friends and relatives of the
members of the First California Volun
teers, who acquitted themselves so nobly
in the Philippine Islands, are making a
determined effort to have the regiment
recalled. A petition to the President and
Secretary of War has been formulated
and copies of it are being freely circulat
ed, with a request for signatures. A copy
is also kept on the desk at the Russ
House, and friends of the boys of the gal
lant First are requested to sign it at that
place if they have r.o other opportunity.
The full text of the petition is as fol
lows: â¢â ,
To the President of the United States and th-
Secretary of War:
"Whereas, The First Regiment of California
Infantry of United States Volunteers were the
first troops to leave the United States for a
foreign port during the war with Spain, having
left San Francisco on May 25, IS9B, and have
been continuously In service away from home
longer than any other volunteer regiment, ex
cept the First Oregon Regiment, which went
out with the First California Regiment, and
Whereas, Many of the men volunteered and
are now detained in the service at great sacri
fl' to their personal and business interests,
and
Whereas, Long detention in a tropical climate
is undermining the health and spirits of many
of our best young men who gave their services
so cheerfully to their country when hostilities
were actually pending, we, the undersigned
relatives and representatives of members of
the First Regiment of California Volun
teers, most earnestly request that said regi
ment be allowed to return to their homes and
business. If troops are necessary in the Phil
ippines we respectfully request that other
troops be sent to relieve those first sent.
By granting our humble request you will re
lieve many anxious hearts in San Francisco
and vicinity and will gratify the most ardent
wish of almost every enlisted mun in said regi
ment.
MRS. BEGAN "WEPT.
The Coroner's Jury Brought a Ver-
diet That the Fatal Shot Was
Tired in Self-Defense.
Mrs. Elizabeth Regan wept bitterly yes
terday when the witnesses told the Coro
ner's jury how Policeman 'Kennedy had
been killed on the day before by a shot
from his own pistol in her hands.
Nothing new was brought out in the
testimony. When the prisoner was asked
whethc-r she wished to take the stand
she replied that she had nothing to add
to what she had already told the police
and that her lawyer had advised her not
to say anything further. She was heavily
. and N-i-raed to be afflicted with
grief lrPcuuse of the loss of her lover and
the tragedy In which by his brutality she
had been forced to play a part.
The jury, composed of business men,
was out only long enough to sign the ver
dict. It was that the deceased came to
his death from a wound inflicted by Mrs.
Elizabeth Kennedy in s< !f-defense.

If This Is Not Forthcoming the Pro

zens Who Were Named
to Act.
The proposed Pacific Ocean Exposi
tion to be held in this city two years
hence was the subject of extended dis
cussion at a meeting of representative
business men yesterday. The meeting
was held in the assembly room of the
Supervisors, and the majority of the
local commercial bodies were represent
ed by delegates. The object of the
meeting was to induce the Supervisors,
acting for the city, to appropriate
$1,000,000 or any part of that amount
and to further assist by securing an
appropriation from the present Legisla
ture and from Congress. This was all
embodied in the following resolution,
presented by A. S. Baldwin. It was
adopted and will be presented to the
Supervisors on Monday. It reads:
Resolved, That the Board of Super
visors of the city and county of San
Francisco be requested to pledge the
faith of the city for an appropriation
or one million dollars in aid of the
Pacific Ocean Exposition to be held in
said city in the year 190 L
Resolved. That the Legislature of
this State be requested to appropriate
the bum of $200,u00 for the same pur
pose, and that the Congress of the
United States be requested to appro
priate $SuO,U(A) for the same purpose.
Resolved, That the Legislature of
this State is respectfully requested to
pass a statute authorizing each county
In the State to provide either by a tax
levy on the issuance of bonds such
amounts as may be deemed necessary
for the aid and support of the above
proposed exposition.
Resolved, That the City and County
Attorney be and he is hereby re
quested to prepare a bill for presenta
tion to the Legislature, vesting th,o
n- cessary power in the governing body
of the city and county of San Fran
cisco and the other counties of the
State of California, ' and submit the
same to this Board of Supervisors 13f
the city and county of San Francisco.
The original committee of fifteen was
enlarged by the addition of men recom
mended by various organizations inter
ested in having an exposition held here.
The proprietors of the three morning
and three evening papers â Messrs.
John D. Spreckels, M. H. de Young, W.
R, Hearst, Paul Blades, R. A. Crothers
and Hugh Hume â were also added to
the committee. In order to straighten
the record, about which there seems
some doubt, the Mayor, Auditor Asa R.
Wells and the twelve Supervisors were
made members of the committee. The
names presented by organizations yes
terday follow:

Requests for clerkships and other
positions were received. These, with
written suggestions as to the scope of
the exposition, were filed, to be later
placed in the hands of the proper offi
cials.
George W. Dickie wanted light on the
scope of the exposition, and incidentally
objected to the name by which the af
fair has been known, as it did not seem
broad enough. In reply to this, W. H.
Mills made what political writers are
pleased to call an "impassioned ad
dress," He went fully into the magni
tude of the present undertaking: and of
the benefits this city would derive from
its being carried out in a proper man
ner. A. S. Baldwin followed in the
same strain, saying that unless all this
assistance which has been asked for is
received it would be injudicious to pro
ceed. While he was talking an enter
prising photographer took a snap shot
photograph of the assemblage. Mr.
Baldwin sat down as though one of
Dewey's guns had been exploded under
him, and in the general laugh which
fallowed, said he "did not know that his
oratory was becoming so pyrotechni
cal."
A letter was read from Colonel E. A.
Denicke, president of Mechanics' Insti
tute, regarding the Colonial Fair, which
the institute proposes holding shortly.
It is intended to memorialize Congress
for an appropriation of $50,000, which
will be spent in the collection of ex
hibits from America's new possessions.
These will be shown here and then
turned over to the State museum.
George A. Newhall tendered the use
of the Chamber of Commerce as being
a central meeting place. The offer was
accepted, and the next meeting will be
held there on Friday at 3:30 p. m. An
effort will then be made to affect a
permanent organization.
SAN BRUNO ELECTRIC LINE.
The New Accommodations Bring Joy
to the Residents.
By the Ist of February the people re-
FicMnK on the San Bruno" road will be
brought in brtter communication with the
city by means of the completion of the
new electric line of cars which will be in
operation en that date.
Work was commenced on this roadway
about two months ago at the intersection
of Folsom strf *-t and Precita avenue and
continued along the avenue to San Bruno
road and back to Folsom street along
Army street. In the meantime a ganij
of laborers were set to work on the San
Bruno road at the five-mile house, where
the old horse car line terminated. From
that place the work has been pushed
with vigor, until now there is only a short
gap between Army street and '"'Tannery
Hollow" to be filled up. when the entire
roadway will be complete and cars run
ning.
From San Bruno road the cars will run
along Army street as far as Folsom
street, to which point transfers "will be
exchanged on both the outgoing and in
coming runs.
The change will do away with the pres
ent transfer system from the Howard
street line at the junction of Potrero ave
nue and Twenty-fourth street.
SALE OF ART TREASURES.
A Magnificent Collection to Be Dis
posed of at Auction.
The people of San Francisco will be af
forded during the coming week an oppor
tunity to not only inspect but purchase
one of the most complete, varied and
magnificent collections of art treasures

PROTESTS ARE
MADE FOR THE
CIGAR MAKERS
Business Men to Avert
a Calamity.
THE LEAF TOBACCO RULING
REVENUE COMMISSIONER ASKED
TO RECONSIDER.
If His Order Is Strictly Enforced
Thousands of Industrious Work
ers Will at Once Become
Poverty Stricken.
The recent decision of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue by which leaf deal
ers in tobacco are prohibited from selling
leaf in "hands" loose and the effects of
this ruling upon the small cigarmakers,
as published exclusively in The Call yes
terday, has attracted the attention of the
entire business community. The injustice
to the small dealers and manufacturers
was so apparent that the large cora
mercial bodies in the city have taken
iho matter in hand and yesterday a dis
patch was sent to Washington asking
that the case be reconsidered and that
pending the decision the ruling com
plained of be suspended.
As stated yesterday the dealer can only
sell to the manufacturer in bundles, bales
or cases, and Is not allowed to break pack
ages and sell in small quantities, as in the
past. Scattered all over the town are
hundreds of cigarmakers who employ one,
two or three men and have only a limited
capital to operate on. Still 'they man
age to make a living Tor themselves,
families, their employes and those de
pendent upon the latter. The manu
facturers' custom has been to buy small
lots as wanted, but if the rule mentioned
goes into effect they will have to close
their shops, as they are not able to ex
pend from $300 to $600 for tobacco in the
original packages. Besides, to make the
proper blends a number of bales or pack
ages would have to be bought.
â¢ The effect of throwing 2000 working men
out of employment and rendering desti
tute those dependent upon them appealed
to the business community and steps were
taken at once to avert such a calamity.
At this time of the year, when all kinds
of business is dull, the throwing of such
a number of pe#ple upon the charity of
the community would be seriously felt in
all classes. Those most interested, the
riKarmakers. found a statute which they
believe covers the ease and 1 makes null
and avoid the rullingof the Commissioner.
Upon presenting the facts to the commer
cial bodies the latter swung readily into
line to assist the workers, ami yesterday
the following dispatch was sent to Wash
ington:
To the Honorable Commissioner of Internal
Revenue. Washington, L>. C. â Sir: Treasury de
cision No. 2U.372. prohibiting the sale of leaf
tobacco in quanaitks less than a bale.
etc., seems to be in conflict with the following
language contained in subdivision VI of sec
tion 3244. Revised Statutes:
"Provided, It shall be lawful for any
licensed manufacturer of cigars to purchase
1-af tobacco of any licensed dpaler or other
manufacturer In quantities lens than the
original paekaces tor use in his own manu
factory exclusively."
In consideration of this matter your atten
tion had probably not been directed to this
clear and unambiguous statutory provision,
and consequently it must have been over
looked. Will you please refnvestijrate the
question as speedily as possible and in the
meantime order a suspension of proceedings
on that decision.
We call your attention to the fact that the
remaining in force of your ruling will virtu
ally destroy the cigar manufacturing industry

FREE CURE FOR BALDNESS
Trial Package of a Remarkable Remedy to Con-
vince People It Actually Grows Hair.
Prevents Hair Falling Out, Removes Dandruff, Stops Itching
and Restores Luxuriant Growth to Shining Scalps.
MISS EMMA EMOIND
(Before Bending for i FrÂ«e Trial Ptektge) (Aftsr Using the Free TrUl and Following Direction!.)
Those who are losing their hair or have
parted with their locks can have it restored
by a remedy that is sent free to all. A Cin-
cinnati firm has concluded that the best way
to convince people that hair can be grown on
any head is to let them try it, and see for
themselves. All sorts of theories have been
advanced to account for falling hair, but alter
all, It Is the remedy we are after and not the
theory. People who need more hair, or are
anxious to save what they have or from sick-
ness, dandruff or other causes have lost their
hair should at once bend their name and ad-
dress to the Altenheim Medical Dispensary, 233
Selves building, Cincinnati, 0., inclosing 4
cents in stamps to cover postage, and they
will forward prepaid by mall, a sufficient free
trial package of their remedy to fully prove
its remarkable action In quickly removing all
trace of dandruff and scalp diseases and forc-
ing a new growth of hair. The remedy is not
a new experiment and no one need fear that
it Is harmful. It cured John- Bruner. post-
master, of Mlllville, Henry County, Ind., and
he strongly urges everyone to try It. A MetfrÂ«
odlst preacher, Victor A. Faigaux, of Tracy
City, Term., was perfectly bald on his fore-
head for many years, but has now a fine
growth. Mrs. C. W. Castleman, 843 Main street.
Riverside, Cal., reports her husband's shiny
head now covered with soft, fine hair, and she,
too, has derived wonderful benefit. Among
others who have used the remedy are George
Dlefenbach, general agent of the Big Four
Railroad of Dayton. ()., whose wife was en-
tirely cured of baldness.
The president of Falrmount College. Sulphur.
Ky., Professor B. F. Turner, was bald for thir-
ty years and now has a splendid growth of
hair from having tried this remarkable rem-
edy. Write to-day for a free trial package. Tt

To-morrow the interested parties will
send communications to all of the Pa

objectionable ruling revoked. It is be
lieved that as soon as the purport of the
Commissioner's ruling is understood
through the country the Internal Revenue
Department will be flooded with similar
protests from all parts of the United
States, for the small cigarmakers are
very numerous in the land and they have
a hard time as it is to compete with the
sweatshop laborers.
TO OUST DEMOCRATS.
The New Republican County Commit-
tee Wants All the Patronage.
The new Republican County Committee,
which was elected by the last Republi
can municipal convention, met last night
in the Shiels building and effected a per
manent organization. A. J. Rich was
elected chairman and P. Prcndergast sec
retary. Harry A. Graham was elected
treasurer. The committee decided to em
power the chair to appoint an executive
committee, the number of which will be
specified by the committee on by-laws.
On motion of A. Ruef the chair was in
structed to appoint an advisory commit
tee to act in conjunction with the exec
utive committee in making a vigorous
protest against certain Democrats who
are holding places in the City Hall under
the Republican administration.

CAPES THE ORDEAL.
Attorney Charles J. Heggerty Repre

Proceedings Continued Un
til the 23d Inst.
Cordelia Botkin has again appeared in
court and again has she returned
to her cheerless cell in the Branch
County Jail without hearing the judg
ment of court condemning her to pass her
remaining days behind the bars of a pen
itentiary. Yesterday was the second day
set for the sentence of the notorious
criminal, and the usual crowd of specta
tors thronged the court. As the fair pris
oner tripped in, accompanied by Mrs.
Robarts, her sister, and Sheriff Martin,
all the spectators "rubbered" and were
content.
Mrs. Botkin seated herself, and Charles
J. Heggerty, who, in the absence of Attor
neys Knight and McGowan, who are
mixed up in the Senatorial fight at Sac
ramento, represented the defendant,
asked for a continuance. It was mildly
objected to by the District Attorney, but
Judge Cook granted the motion, setting
th< 2.'id inst. as the date for further pro
ceedings.
Trouble About "Drunks."
The "drunks" were distributed over the
different Police Courts yesterday morn
ing insttad of being discharged in the City
Prison. Thip caused considerable annoy
ance. Certain Seymour objected on Fri
day to Jucipe Mogan sending word to the
prison to discharge all the "drunks" and
insisted tbat the Judge should go to the
prison am- discharge them separately.
The Judge complied with the request, but
to prevent further bother the captain will
in future send them to the courts the
B-ime as other cases. The Judges have
been in the habit of taking the "drunks"
euol. alternate week as a matter of uon
venienco to themselves.

CLAIRVOYANTS.

A MAN TRULY GIFTED WITH POWERS OF
SECOND SI6HT.
Prof. Carl Roth, the Clairvoyant, Proves
Marvelous Revelations to Skeptic 3
of San Francisco.
_ Mr ~ Professor Roth, the
JBOj&PÂ§&J clairvoyant, is get-
fiS|Br^^jk tlngr to be Ihe most-
Set >*^Bk^*^ talked -of man in
IK I '^^EaT San Francisco. His

]T JwSÃ' street is crowdod

>B^|||toj^Jk -all classes, rich and
<^PÂ§p||||y3|^ poor alike, all anx-
ious to kno w wn 'it
; f?\ destiny holds in
"*^^'' store for them.
Some there are whose careworn faces
speak plainer than words could tell that
their lot in life has not been a happy one,
and that misfortune and disappointment
have aged them mure than years. Many
whose burden has seemed a heavy one,
and to whom life has been a vast, com-
plicated, profound mystery, are seen to
leave his place with a lighter step and
faces beaming with the joy of a new-
found hope. Others who come in carri-
ages and whose appearances suggest that
the fates have been less unkind are seen
to wait patiently for an opportunity to
consult this great physician of human
woes. The powers possessed by Professor
Roth seem almost too remarkable to be
true, but the proof he gives by reading
the innermost secrets of those who call
upon him is sufficient to convince the
most skeptical mind. Many who had al-
most given up in despair have been
buoyed up with new hopes and started
anew on the road to a successful life by
following his advice. The anticipation of
better days to come with "a little light in
the darker places" is the elixir that has
restored many broken hearts.

PATTON'S BLIGHTED
POLITICAL HOPES
STERN PARENT TAKES A HAND
IN HIS CAMPAIGN.
Wanted to Be Marshal of Alameda
and Unwittingly Used His Fath
er's Funds for Expenses.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 14.â Clarence Patton,
a young man about 25 years old, who
made himself famous during t\\c last cam
paign by breaking up a political meeting
ast Alameda, when he insisted upon
ng on the platform and announcing
himself as a candidate for the office of
City Marshal, has had all of his political
ambitions crushed. The crushing was
done by his father, the well-known archi
tect who desfgaed the plans for San Fran-
Pcisco's "new" City Hall. The instrument
by which the crushing was done was a
j stout switch.
Young Patton, who Is somewhat eccen
tric and quite a character about the city,
has had his eye on the Marshal's office
for some time. He stated to his frit-mis
that he was going to make a hurricane
campaign for the position and would be a
Bure winner at the spring election. The
only thing that stood in the way of his
carrying out his plans was the lack of
funds. A few days ago, however, young
Patton went down the cocktail row and
announced that his campaign for the
tp had been started. He backed
up the assertion by treating the boys. His
campaign was progressing nicely, and he
felt that his light was already won, when
his paternal ancestor swooped down upon
him and in tones that boded no good com
manded the young politician to repair to
the Patton domicile at once and lose no
time in getting t
Father and son reached the house about
the same time. Thi public took no part in
the interview that followed. Out into the
night came the angry tones of a stern
parent and the humble replies of a
crashed aspirant for political honors.
Then the dull thu'l of a snout stick coming
in vigorous contact with the back of a
candidate for the office of City Marshal,
and the lights went out and all was still.
Later it was learned tfta.t young Patton
had found a stray gold piece around the
house, ar..l. thinking that some good angel
had left it for his campaign expenses, he
appropriated the coin and went forth to
lin- up hit But it so happened
that the gold piece did not come from a
good angel. It belonged to Patton . Sr..
and that Is why Patton Jr. has retired
from politic?.

THE SAX FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1399.
RUMORS OF A
TRADE WITH
REPUBLICANS
Delegates Appointed
to the Convention.
OPPOSITION IS INCREASING
THE DISSATISFIED ARE TO ACT
INDEPENDENTLY.
May Call a Mass Meeting in Every
Ward to Choose Delegates to
Name a Full
Ticket.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 14.
After the Republican convention to be
held on Monday there will probably be
another organization effected to name a
municipal ticket. This move is being en
gineered by those who claim that there
Is collusion between the Municipal I.
and the Republican City Central Commit
tee.
The Central Committee named its dele
gates to-night to Monday's convention,
and this method has created much un
pleasantness. It is freely prophesied that
the campaign will be a repetition of the
tactics employed four years ago, aW which
occasion the party organization stood in
with the Municipal League, while the
rank and file of the party voted for a
separate ticket. This led to the election
of John L. Davie, although J. \V\ Nelson
was the nominee of the Republicans, the
Democrats and the Municipal .League.
Under ordinary circumstances N
shuiild have polled about 6000 votes and
Davle 2000. but Davie was elected.
It is nÂ»w stated that the candidates
nominated by the Municipal League will
be indorsed next Monday, and that there
is an understanding to this effect. The
opponents to this plan are preparing to
hold a mass meeting in each ward, at
/Which delegates to an independent con
vention may be elected to nominate a
ticket in opposition to the combined ticket
of the Republican Committee and the
Municipal League.
It is known that one of the seven mem
bers of the committee is opposed to ap
pointing delegates in the proposed man
ner, and as the Army and Navy League
and one of the Republican clubs in the
Seventh Ward and an independent citi
zens' movement in the Fifth "Ward have
already declared their position It can
easily be seen that the foundation for an
active opposition is already laid.
The plans for the opposition ticket will
not be completed until it is seen what
the Republican convention dots on Mon
day.
A proposition has already been made
to the city committee to change Its plan
of calling the convention and to suggest
that a certain proportion of the delegates
be nominated by the Board of Trade and
hants" Kxchange as a guarantee that
the campaign will not be conducted by
any political clique. This proposition has
not met with favor from the committee
and it is not known how far the sugges
tion was authorized by the mercantile- or
ganizations.
The Democrats will meet next week and
as fusion is already repudiated by both
Democrats and Populists each may put a
ticket in the field, although it is more
than probable that some combination will
be made with the dissatisfied Republicans
and that a union effort will be organized
to defeat the reform ticket.

J. H. WILLIAMS
MIGHT HAVE
LEFT A WILL
The Aged Capitalist
Was Peculiar.
ORDERED HIS OWN FUNERAL
LED INTO LITIGATION BY DE
SIGNING PARTIES.
His Grandson Accepted a Trust
Which He Was Glad to Relin
quish â Exaggerated
Stories of Wealth.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 14.
A search is being made for a will that
Is supposed to have been left by the late
John N. Williams, who died last week
at Claremont. During his lifetime Mr.
Williams was possessed of considerable
money, but lacked all business qualifica
tions and experienced during the last few
years many vicissitudes that materially
altered -the ordinary course of the last
days of his life.
All sorts of exaggerated stories have
been circulated regarding the wealth and
actions of Williams, and although he had
some eccentric notions and some original
ideas he appears to have found his best
friend in the person of his grandsonyC.
D. Vincent. Mr. Vincent a few years ago
was made the recipient of deeds covering
all his grandfather's property. These
deeds represented an estate worth ap
proximately $45,000, instead of $245,000, as
has been reported. It was at Williams'
request that Vincent accepted the prop
erty and on the agreement that the
grandson pay the old man $100 per month
for the rt*t of his life.
Some time after the transfer of the
property Williams was induced by Info r
ested parties to try to get his property
l>afk. He filed a very sensational suit.
charging Vincent with ingratitude. The
suit never came to trial because inquiry
on the part of Vincent's attorneys re
vealed the fact that the obligation was
all on the part of Williams and in favor
of Vincent.
Recognizing this, Williams and his at
torneys and Vincent and his attorneys
signed a 'stipulation which Is on file in the
Superior Court, stating that all claims
on either side had been adjusted with per
fect satisfaction, and also setting forth
that "Williams had commenced the suit
without fully understanding what he was
about, owing to his old age and lack of
ordinary business knowledge.
Williams died last week possessed of
much property, which is, however, heavily
mortgaged. Immediately after his death
his landlady found a peculiar order on a
local undertaker, requesting . him to at
once proceed to the house and take charge
of the body and take it to his undertaking
parlors. -This order was signed by "Wil
liams, and his landlady obeyed it. At thn
funeral there were but few mourners, and
these Included Mrs. Gray, a daughter of
Williams, and Mrs. Vincent. Mr. Vincent,
who is a contractor, in the southern
part of the State and could not attend.
After the agreement tiled in court dis
missing the. suk Mr. Williams and his
grandson never spoke to each other, al
though the latter always took good care
to see that the old man needed nothing.
Should a will be found it will probably
lead to some litigation.
GOOD LUCK FOLLOWS
SERIOUS MISFORTUNE
INSOLVENT CONTRACTOR IN
HERITS A PRINCELY ESTATE.
4-. R. Denke Fails for a Large Sum
and the Next Day Learns He Is
in Financial Clover.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 14.-Misfortune and j
good luck are following in rapid succes
sion in the affairs of A. R. Denke, the con
tractor, who made and lost a fortune try
ing to build up West Alameda with pretty
homes. Denke had reached the pinnacle
of prosperity about three years ago, when
he got into domestic troubles which
brought about an estrangement between
himself and wife. One of his sons took
sides with his mother and started in busi
ness in opposition to his father.
From that time Denke'? financial affairs I
began to tangle and the; cra.sli came last '
Tuesday, when he was forced to file a I
petition in insolvency. His debts were I
over $16,000.
That was his worst mis-fortune, but the
following day he received information <>f
a bit of good luck that sent a gleam of ,
sunshine through a riff in the clouds of !
his financial troubles. The day's mail j
brought him a letter from his old home in
Germany apprising him of the death of
an uncle and containing the further in
formation that the aforesaid uncle hail j
remembered him in his will to the ex
tent of $50,000.
] >â¢ oke hastened to his creditors with the !
glad. tidings and asked them not to press â 
the insolvency proceedings until he bad
time to receive his inheritance from the !
old country, when he promised to settle i
his accounts dollar for dollar. The cred- â¢
itors are considering the proposition, but j
will look into the matter thoroughly be- I
fore they give a decided ewswer.
CHINESE LABORERS
SOLD INTO SLAVERY
Hundreds of Asiatic Coolies Sent to
Mexico to Work on Plan
tations.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Jan. 14.-A story
of alleged Chinese slavery has come to
light here since the arrival of the steam
ship Empress of Japan from the Orient.
She brought from Hongkong 406 Chinese,
of whom 191 were reported to be destined
for Tamplco, Mexico, to work on planta
tions. They were under the care of a
Chinese named Ma Chop, who said thir
teen hundred more were to follow.
AYhlle herding the Chinese from the
dock to a special train a stampede en
sued. In their frenzy a number rushed
toward the fnlge of the nock. They would
have fallen into the bay had it not been
for a police officer, who stopped the rush
by knocking a score of them down. When
they were finally rounded up it was found
that eight were missing. After several
minor stampedes the Chinese were per
suaded to get on the train.
The cause of the frenzy and stampede
was the arrival of a Chinaman from San
Francisco, who told them they had been
sold as slaves by Hongkong men. and
that they would never go back to China
Local Chinese here are helplne the men
still in hiding in every possible way. as
all are convinced that tney and the re
mainder of the 1300 to follow are being
sold Into slavery. They are gomg to
send word to the Chinese government
about it.
The city police are hunting down the
missing Chinese for evading the $50 poll
tax. The Canadian Pacific officials also
are hunting them, because they have con
tracted to take the party safely over their
lines and are liable to a heavy customs
penalty for every Chinese landed in Brit
ish Columbia who does not pay poll tax.
The police force of the State or Sao
Paulo, Brazil, is henceforth to consist of
5150 men. This Is quite an army, In view
of the fact thnt the total population of
the State is under 1.500,000.

own weapons. The Engineering Fed
eration, which proved so powerful in
the recent strike, has invited employers
in all the trades - "crush the tyranny"
of trades unionism. One object of the
combination is to secure legislation fa
vorable to the employers.
The Railroad Review asserts that one
firm has placed Â£35,000 at the disposal
of the organization's parliamentary
committee, though how it could be ex
pended legitimately does not appear. If
such a thing happened in America it
would be called a "corruption fund."
The second object of the organization
is to secure for employers freedom to
make contracts with individuals in
stead of with the unions. The employ
ers pledge themselves not to negotiate
directly with strikers, but to deal
through the committee of the organiza
tion.
The backbone of the scheme Is found
in the arrangement by which a tirm
lighting a strike will receive indemnity
equal to its average profits. Even the
Daljy Chronicle, the workingman's or
gan, warns the labor leaders that they
have been carrying matters in a little
too high-handed a manner, and admits
what every one knows that the
standard day's work fixed b" the unions
is below the capacity of the average
man.
The unions will not permit their
members to exceed the standard and
also assert the rights of workmen to
take holidays whenever they please, re
gardless of their employers in this and
protect them for so doing. The em
ployers complain that they cannot in
duce idle men to work even at the high
wages which prosperity warrants. The
Chronicle admits that there are many
workmen living on the union funds who
could get employment if they chose.
The American Society here is taking
extraordinary measures to check the
great notoriety attained by Colonel
George Gourand. who, of his own mo
tion, assumed the leadership of the
American wing of the Anglo-American
movement in London. Colonel Gourand
first came forward on the occasion of
the" arrival of General Lord Kitchener
of Khartoum in England. The colonel
went to Dover to greet him, and is the
most conspicuous figure in the kineto
scope pictures of the event shown in
the music halls. Since then he has
deluged the papers with letters, writing
always in the name of the United
States army and of the Americans in
London, signing a string of titles to
his name, of which the first was "the
one-time assistant inspector general of
artillery on the staff of General Sher
man." He pledged the Americans to
contribute Â£1000 to the fund for the
erection of the Gordon memorial col
lege at Khartoum and issued a circular
with glaring headlines, requesting con
tributions to found an "educational
chair of science." The colonel's latest
appeal is for money for the Englishmen
who enlisted in the United States army,
helped to defeat Spain and were after
wards discharged, of whom he says
there were many. This was taken up
by some of the papers as corroborating
the assertion of Cunningham Graham
that the best fighting in the Spanish
war was done by Englishmen.
The whole business has made the
London Americans a laughing stuck,
and the executive committee of the
American Society has issued a letter to
editors and others declaring the col
onel has no warrant to speak for any
one but himself.
John W. Bookwalter of Ohio, whose
views on Russia were published in a
dispatch from here to the Associated
Press, under date of December 22, is
returning to the United States with the
intention of writing a book describing
his three months' travel in Siberia.
Incidentally, this work will be a plea
for an American alliance- with Russia
intead of Great Britain. He says his
observations in this country have
strengthened hi 3 pro-Russian views
and adds: "The interests of the United
States ami England are radically an
tagonistic, anrtthe attempt to foster an
aliiance is an* artificial movement, so
far as England is concerned. It has
not yet captured the hearts of the peo
ple "and is merely a political device
with two aims. First, to divert Amer
ica's attention from conflicting inter
ests in her own hemisphere: second, to
make the United States Great Britain's
catspaw in her diplomatic game in the
East. She thinks that if she can point
to the United States as an ally, she will

The State Medical Instituts Discovers a
Remarkable Eejaedy for Lost
Vigor.
ARE SENDING FREE A TRIAL PACKAGE
TO ALL WHO WRITE.
Free samples of a most remarkable
rem^dv are being distributed by the State
Medical Institute Fort Ind It
cured so many men who had battled for
years against the mental and physicai
suffering of lost manhood that the insti-
tute has decided to distribute free trial
nackages to all who write. It is a home
treatment and all men who suffer with
mv form of sexual weakness, resulting
from youthful folly, premature losa of
Ktreneth and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the df sired location, giving strength
and development just where It is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions 'and hae been an absolute success
in all cases. A reaueut to the State Med-
ical Institute, 198 First National Bank
buUding, Fort Wayne Ind., stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will be compiled with. The Institute
ia deslrouÃ of reaching that groat class
of men who are unable to leave home to
be treated and the free sample will en-
able them to see how easy it Is to bo
cured of sexual weakness when the
proper remedies are employed. The in-
stitute makes no restrictions, Any man
who writes will be sent a free sample,
carefully sealed In a plain package so
that Its recipient need have no fear of
emhttrrnss^mcnt or publicity. Readers are
requested to write without delay.
be able to extort better terms from
Russia. What America wants in the
East is trade and she will do more by j
co-operation witL Russia than by an
tagonizing Russia. The latter already '.
practically controls China and will
give the United States what she wants,
if friendly. It would be madness for
England and America to attempt to
coerce Russia into concessions. The
combined nations of the world could
not whip Russia, any more than they |
could the United States. The most
they could do would be to bombard a
few coast towns, while Russia's rail
roads could pour so many soldiers into
China that any the United States and
Great Britain could send would be a
handful in comparison.

DAWSON MYSTEEY.
Rumor That Myrtle Brocee Was the
Victim of a Murderer.
MCTORIA, Jan. 14.â R. M. McCoy, -who
left Dawson December 15. brought news
to Skaguay that when he left Dawson the
rumor was abroad that Myrtle Broeoe
had been murdered instead or committing
suicide, as reported. Th^re are several
circumHtancfs connected with net i
that caused suspicion, and the police were
watching suspected persons. No arrest
had been made up to the time he left.

surprise on December 14, when the news
came in from Gold Run that gold had
actually l>'en found. This is the firs;

Representative Filipinos Who Will Ask
Congress for Liberty and Self-
Government
THE stenmrr Nippon Maru of the
Toyo Kisen Kalsha line, from
Hongkong, which arrived h.-re
yesterday, brought from Manila
three most interesting persons.
The trio in question consists of
Dr. Jose Lasoda, "professeur de la
faculte de medecine" of one of the
established colleges in Manila; John
Luna, "artist peintre," H. (_'., "mem
bre de la Societe dcs Beaux-Artes de
Paris" and "correspondent dv journal
'La Independencia,' " and M. Marti
Burgos, "capitaine de I'armee Philip
pine."
It was stated that the party were
members of Aguinaldo's cabinet and
were on their way to Washington on
some secret mission which they re
fused to divulge. Such is not the case.
The three gentlemen, who are at the
Palace, it is true are en route to the
national capital, but they have no
hesitancy in talking of the nature of
the business that brings them to this
country. They come as the repre
sentatives of the provisional govern
ment of the Philippines, not in the
â  1" commissioners, but more as
suppliants to lay before Congress and
the President the fact that th
ii>inos desire to govern themselves.
They propose to ask in the name of
common justice that the United
States allow them to have their own
independent government. They fur
ther declare that they believe that this
will be granted when they are allowed

One of the most worthy institutions in
this city Is sadly in need of funds with
which to carry on its good work. The
name of the Institution has only to be
mentioned when the charitably Inclined
people of this city will know that the
cause Is truly a worthy one.
It is the Children's Hospital, and for
some time the good ladies who devote
their time to its welfare have been seri
ously hampered in their work for want
of sufficient funds.
Now Morris Meyerfeld, president of the
Walter Orpheum, has generously donated
the use of the Orpheum Theater for a
monster benefit, and every cent taken in
at the box office on that afternoon will go
to swell the hospital funds. There will be
no deduction made for rent, lights, em

just so much added to the funds that the
ladies will have on hand to alleviate the
sufferings of the little children in the
hospital wards.
Manager Morrisey of the Orpheum has
secured the services of all the Orpheum
artists and a number of volunteer talent
as well. Harry Orndorff, the Orpheum's

keep an armed force in the islands.
To this fact they attribute the pres
ent warlike state of affairs. They say
the Filipinos will never consent to be
under this Government as a colony,
but they admit that they might agree
to an equal citizenship. Statistics
show, they claim, that there are 11.
--000.000 people in the Islands, and of this
number 600.000 have never been under
the rule of Spain. These the Spanish
called the unconquerable. The Spanish
also gave out that the population of
the islands was only 7,000,000.
Under their present government the
power of Aguinaldo is recognized as
being absolute. The people of the
islands were made tn believe when the
war begun that this country was
merely helping them to gain their
liberty, as it was the wish of this
country that all nations should be
free. They think in view of thjs fact
that it Is but just that the United
States should find out what the Fil

tion of 10,000,000 at least 9,000,000 recog
nize and are loyal to the government
as represented by Aguinaklo. The

HISTORIC FLAG FOR
GOLDEN GATE PARK
THE "homeward bound" flag purchased by the crow of the little dis
patch boat McCulloch will become the property of Golden Gate Park
this afternoon, and hereafter on gala occasions will float proudly
from the nag-pole at the bandstand as a memento of the glorious
service done by the boys in blue at Manila. The flag is a very handsome
one, 18x30 foet in dimensions, and made of the best Japanese silk.
When Admiral Dewey ordered the McCulloch home the crew of enlisted
men clubbed together and raised a purse of $175 with which they bought the
flag. At sea there were many consultations held regarding the final dispo
sition of the pretty banner. The matter was put to vote. Several ballots
were taken and Golden Gate Park came out winner every time. This is
the more of a compliment to San Francisco as the boys oÂ» the McCulloch
only knew of the park from hearsay. They are from Philadelphia and
vicinity and had never seen the park.
As many of them leave for home to-morrow, there will be little cere
mony. The flag will be presented by a member of the crew at 2-30 this
afternoon and will probably be received by Mr. MetÃon on behalf of thÂ«
Park Commissioners.
W. F. HERRIN
DENOUNCED BY
ANGRY MINERS
Charged With Grabbing a Valua
ble Mine From a Defense
less Old Man.
Dave Nagle and His Ready Gun Were Con
nected With the Jobâ Gold Diggers of
Tuolumne Are Aroused.
THE miners and merchants of Tuol
umne County, who have often read
of the devious methods of W. F.
Herrin in his various capacities as
general manipulator of the Southern Pa
cific's dubious schemes, not only believe
these charges made against him, but by
the diggers in the mines about Sonora he
is considered a heartless, oppressive man,
who is using his great power of wealth
and position to defraud a poor old Italian
miner of a valuable mine. Herrln's agent
In this instance is the notorious Dave
Nagle, whose reputation is too well known
to require airing. Herrin's operations in
this mining deal are nothing less than
claim-jumping, if the statements of the
oppressed miner, his lawyer and his
friends are true.
From the United States Land Office at
Stockton and the attorney for an op
pressed miner at Sonora The Call has
obtained the facts contained in the story
of the Carlotta Mining Company, of
which W. P. Herrin is president and Dave
Nagle superintendent. This company has
applied for a patent on a mine which has
been in the undisputed possession of one
man for over forty years, and by a most
peculiar error the surveyor who was em
ployed by both sides made a plat locating
the uriglnal owner on a site six miles
from his original location. Herrin s com
pany was located on the proper range,
and the land office refuses to correct the
surveyor's mistake.
A man employed to do assessment work
by the original and rightful owner of the
mine in question has been driven from
his work by Dave Nagle, who stood with
a rifle in his hand and threatened to kill
any man who interfered with the scheme
he has charge of. Tuolumne miners are
peaceful, law-abiding citizens, who hate
Injustice and despise a swindler. These
hardy men have no fear of Dave Nagle s
ever ready gun, and should his linger
ever press the trigger and harm an in
offensive man in that section hia punish
ment will be swift and sure. These nien
who are wresting wealth from the rocks
are more than indignant at the treatment
one of their kind has received from Her
rin, Nagle & Co., and they unhesitatingly
denounce the legal adviser of the Hunt-
Way back in 3850 Francisco Cardemar
tori located the Venus claim and re
mained in undisputed possession of the
property up to a year ago. He worked
hard and incessantly to develop the prop
erty and success was about to crown his
years of labor and poverty, when he
learned that several rich and powerful
men claimed his property. The Carlotta
mine had been located in I&>9, and was
being worked by its owners, Sutton and
Symons, who sold out to the company
which now seeks control of and title to
the major portion of the Venus claim.
Cardemartori believed the Carlotta was
the adjoining claim to his own, on which
he had labored for over forty years. Be
lieving his title was safely established
and not expectin- an attempt would be
made to rob him of his mine, he paid no
attention to the work being done on the
mine near his own. He was fortunate
enough to strike a rich vein and was just
beginning to develop It. Never antici
pating that his claim was practically the
same as the Carlotta, the aged miner con
tinued his daily efforts to extract the pre
cious gold from nature's strong box, se
renely indifferent to the operations going
on not far from his tunnel.
The Carlotta claim was u^> for sale for
several years, but no one familiar with
the country or the conditions would buy
It as it was not patented, and the old
Italian's claim was recognized as .ne bet
ter of the two. Many miners also knew
there was a conflict in the claims, but
as the question had never been brought
to an issue the matter only came up when
references to the sale of the Carlotta were
made. About a year ago agents of H. E.
Huntington and Herrin went to Tuolumne
County to seek some good mining invest
ments. One of these agents was Dave
Nagle. who was not known except by his
unenviable reputation at that time. Wil
liam Symons, Fred Sutton and F. Y\ .
Street, the owners of the Carlotta, sold
their Interests in the mine to the repre
sentatives of the railroad people. Before
the sale was consummated, however,
these agents were informed by a half
dozen Tuolumne miners that the old Ital
ian had a better title to the property
than the vendors. To one of these people
Dave Nagle is reported to have said:
"We have bought all the interests we
intend to buy. and we will get that mine."
Soon after this Herrin's company filed
an application for a patent on the Car
lotta mine. This application was pub
lished according to law and, seeing the
notices bearing the description of the
Carlotta claim, Cardemartori learned for
the first time that the mine on which ne
had spent his life and labor was claimed
by others. He went to his American
friends for advice and they told him to
go to the Carlotta people and explain his
position and sell out. Acting on this coun
sel the old Italian sent a friend, who was
coming to San Francisco, to see Herrin.
The mtner called at the yellow building
and after waiting nearly a whole day
finally succeeded in seeing the grand po
litical mogul. Herrin would not listen to
the man and dismissed the interviewer
with a heartless sentence. The rights of
the poor old septuagenarian miner did not
concern him. He would be guided wholly
by his agentsâ and gun-fighter Dave Na
gle was one of these.
Cardemartori again sought his friends
and they told him to get a lawyer to pro
tect his rights against the heartless har
pies who were trying to oust him from his
property. John P. O'Brien, the Sonora
attorney, took the miner's case in hand
and prepared to file an adverse claim, giv
ing a survey and appending the facts al
ready stated. The Carlotta company had
filed their application for a patent, hav
ing 1 their alleged claim surveyed by Dep
uty Surveyor Barton of Sonora. Attor
ney O'Brien protested against the issu
ance of the patent on the Carlotta and
then set about to prepare his client's case
for submission to the Land Office officials.
Surveyor Barton was employed to sur
vey the Venus claim. He made the neces
sary drawings, delivered them to O'Brien
and submitted the plat and affidavits to
the Land Office at Stockton.
Several months elapsed, when the Land
Office finally Informed Cardemartori that
his adverse claim had no standing, as the
Venus mine, according to the deputy
surveyor's plat, was located on range 15,
while the Carlotta mine, for which patent
was asked, was situated on range 16.
Attorney O'Brien saw at once that an
I error, inexcusable by the way, had been
: committed, and he endeavored to have it
corrected. He was informed at the Land
Office that, notwithstanding a clerical er
ror had been made, no remedy was to be
had. The lawyer then obtained a cor
rected plat from Surveyor Barton and
also his affidavit that the Venus mine was
located on range 16. This was also thrown
j out by the officials at Stockton. An ap
peal was taken to the General Land Of
hce and the action of the local receiver
was sustained.
This left Cardemartorl but one more
chance to hold his mine. He must appeal
to the Secretary of the Interior. This was
done, and the briefs, affidavits and plats
were sent on last wtek. An action to
| restrain the Carlotta mine from encroach
| ing upon the claim of Cardemartori is also
pending in the Superior Court of Tuol
umne County.
While his attorney was attending to
the legal technicalities of the case the
a < K l. owner of the Venus, to protect his
rights, prepared to do the assessment
)t Â°, n his claim. Last December, near
tne end of the month, when but few days
remained during which the yearly assess
ment work could be done, Cardemartori
began his task. He employed Joe Rollert.
who worked all one week and went to his
home Sunday. Monday morning Roller!
returned to his work. Dave Nagle and
two companions were at the Venus, wait-
Ing for him. The assessment work had
been obliterated and Rollerl's tools bur
led or thrown away. Nagle, who was
armed with a rifle, ordered Roller! to
move on and told him if he was caught
around there again he would kill him and
! bury him in a prospect hole. Nagle's re
peated threats and his readiness to make
good those threats have no terror for
i many miners in Tuolumne, and more than
one indignant knight of the drill who
knows the particulars of the Carlotta
deal has declared that the career of the
bouthern Pacific's bad man will come to
a sudden close if he becomes "too pro
miscuous."
Nagle is the ostensible superintendent
of the Carlotta mine, but the citizens of
Tuolumne, who know his record, are sat
isfied he is only serving Herrin and Hunt
ington in their endeavor to obtain posses
sion of a valuable mine by fighting away
the rightful owner. Conservative miners
at Sonora say the Venus claim Is a good
one, and in its present condition is easily
worth $10,000. arid the vein is considered
one of great promise. The mine is lo
cated near Cherokee, about twelve miles
from Sonora,
, Cardemartori located the Venus claim
In ISSO, and later mortgaged and sold It to
Captain' Lombardo, who took many
thousands from it. The mine was aban
doned for a while, but in 1880 Lombardo
and the present owner relocated it. Lom
bardo died, leaving- his interest to his
partner. The Carlotta was located by
Sutton about a dozen years ago.
Since the Ist of January, according to
reports in Sonora, the Carlotta company
has leased the mine to which they claim
ownership. It Is said that C. P. Hunting
ton gave peremptory orders to his nephew
and Herrin that they must cease mining
or railroading. They obeyed by leasing
their mines, but they still retained owner
ship and direct the lessee's conduct of the
property. . .

In Her Forthcoming Book She Will Tell Ail About the Horrors of the Cuban Campaign as She and Her Assistants Saw It, and Wall Score the War Department.
IN her forthcoming book on the history of the Red Cross So
ciety, a review of whose preliminary chapters has already ap
peared in the New York Sunday Herald, Miss Clara Barton will
give to the world a thrillingâ almost a grewsomeâ narrative
of official mismanagement. Through the courtesy of the pub
lishers the advance sheets of those newer portions of the work
that deal with the Cuban campaign are here reviewed. The state
ments are Miss Barton's, and will appear over her own name in
the volume to be issued next month.
It must remain for the War Investigation Commission to lay
the blame for the shameful mismanagement she describes on the
proper shoulders. Every candid reader will rise from the perusal
of the book with the fixed impression that had it nut been for the
aid cheerfully extended by the Red Cross and grudgingly accepted
by the military authorities, the loss of life and health at Siboney
and Santiago would have been well nigh unparalleled in the history
of modern warfare.
The publishers of the book are the American National Red
Cross at Washington, D. C.
IN reviewing Miss Barton's forth
coming book I must necessarily
pass over much that is Interesting
about the beginning of the Red
18 campaign in Cuba and the
. official stumbling blocks placed in the
, society's way, and come down to the
.Bltuatij-in just previous to the destruc
tion of the Maine. At this time Miss
â Barton was already well established in
r.Cuba, and was dispensing relief at
â -Ceno, a suburb <.f Havana.

black specks like huge epeters flying
in all directions.
"Then it faded away. The bells ran*,
the whistles blew and voices In the
street were heard for a moment. Then
all was quiet again. I supposed it to
be the bursting of some mammoth mor
tar or explosion of some magazine. A
few hours later came the terrible news
of the Maine."
Some forty of the wounded were
brought ashore and placed in the Span
ish hospital of San Ambrosio. All the
jni'mbers of the Red -ross hurried to
th( ir relief.

Upon the advice of the Consul Gen
eral at Havana the lied Cross retired
when the President recalled all Ameri

Cuba the Archbishop of Havana pub
licly blessed the Lee Orphanage in the
presence of a large crowd. In the eyes
Of nil Catholics, Cuban and Spanish
alike, this blessing was a symbol of
protection by the church and a warrant
of success. Hence Miss Barton was not
surprised to lea-rn several months after
the war had begun that the Spanish
authorities had not only taken the most
scrupulous care of the hospital, but
had also placed a guard around her
former private residence.
Return to Key Weet.
On April 11, 1898, Miss Barton and her
staff! boarded the ship Olivette and after
â¢ a great deal of discomfort caused by
overcrowding of passengt s and stormy
weather, reached Tampa, Fla., two daya
later. Leaving the rest of the party at
Tampa, Miss Barton proceeded to
Washington with Drs. Hubbell and
Egan. The Red Cross agents left in
Florida found work enoug-h to hand in
looking after the 1500 Cuban refugees In
Tampa and the 800 or 900 in Key West.

pendent for a period of some seven
months upon the good offices of the Red
Cross agents.
In the meantime Miss Barton, in
Washington, also had her hands full.
Early in April it had been decided by
the Cuban Relief Committee in New
York to charter a steamer in that port,
load her with supplies and send her
to different ports in Cuba, where her
cargo could be unloaded in such quanti
ties as might be required.
The steamer Btate of Texas was ac
cordingly selected. Notwithstanding the
departure of the Red Cross party from
Havana and the subsequent declaration
of war with Spain the preparations
were kept up and the steamer was load
ed with a cargo embracing a fine as
sortment of necessaries and delicacies,
medicine and other hospital stores. She
arrived at Key West on April 28, and
was met by Miss Barton, who had come
down from Washington, and all the
Red Cross assistants who had been left
in Tampa.
Key West at that time was a very
busy place, the harbor being filled with
naval vessels which came in daily from
the Cuban blockade squadron for coal
and provisions. There was scarecly
a day that some accident did not hap
pen to sailor or workman. The Red
Cross doctors were at all times in de
mand. In order to keep every one in
the best preparation for possible con
tingencies those on board the State of
Texas were instructed and drilled in
the various phases of their particular
work, and at all times of the day the
Red Cross boat, with its well known
flag floating, could be seen going from
one transport to another on Its errand
of mercy.
Prisoners Left to Starve.
There were other charities which
clamored for the attention of the Red
Crocs officials. Scarcely a day passed
that Borne of the blockading squadron
did not bring into Key West from one
to three captured prizesâ ships, schoon
ers, steamers or fishing smacks. With
in a couple of weeks after the declara
tion of war there were between thirty
and forty of these boats lying at an
chor in the harbor with their crews
aboard under guard. Somehow it was
forgotten these poor foreigners must
eat to live! Or perhaps somebody
thought that somebody else was re
sponsible for this very important mat
ter.
At all events, when the small amount
of provisions aboard the boats at the
time of capture had been exhausted,
calls were made on the United States
Marshal for additional food. Having
no contingent fund upon which to draw,
and knowing the quantities of red tape
that must be unraveled before he could

secure any relief, the Marshal came
to Miss Barton with his troubles. That
good lady reassured him by promising
to provide for all the prisoners until
such time as he could Ret his petition
through the circumlocution office.' Sev
eral boatloads of provisions were hasti
ly gathered and taken in tow by a
steam launch, which landed them
alongside of each prize.
Miss Barton visited every boat in per
son, learned the wants of the crews
through an Interpreter, and not only
supplied all needed foods, but ar
ranged to take all letters and forward
them to their destination through the
intermediary offices of the Red Cross at
Portugal.
Could Not Reach Reconcentrados.
On.' June 20, everything being in read-*
mess, and no disapproval having been
elicited from the Navy Department, it
was decided to sail and find Sampson's
fleet near Santiago de Cuba, Here it
was generally believed that General
Shafter would try to effect a landing.
On the 25th the State of Texas arrived
off Morro. Castle, at the entrance of
Santiago Bay. The Spanish flag was
flying over the land fortifications and
Sampson's . fleet was stationed in the
adjacent waters.
Miss . Barton sent a 'representative
aboard I the flagship New York asking
Rear Admiral Sampson for instructions.
Word was returned that General Sh.af
ter's army had disembarked at Bai
quiri, a point about twelve miles east
if Morro Castle. The admiral advised
Miss Barton to take her ship to Guan
tanamo.Bay, where she would find good !
anchorage and calm water, and where
she would be able to . learn more of
ivhat was taking v place on land, as
there was constant communication
from there with the invading army.
rho Texas accordingly drew away and :
irrived that evening at Playa del Este,
lust inside the mouth of Guantanamo
F3ay and some forty miles from Santi
igo.
Here two reporters from New York
japers called. on Miss; Barton, inform
ng her that' they had - Just come in ,

leed of supplies and medical aid. They
old how, many of the wounded in the
Ight between the Rough Riders and the
Spaniards, on the previous Friday, had
iust been brought in and were suffer
ng from lack of everything in the way
if comfort and conveniences. The
steamer was at once headed westward
md started to the scene of suffering,
which she reached at 8 o'clock.
A party of doctors accomplished a
difficult 'landing' in an open boat and
found their way to the army hospital.
This was a rough wooden building
which had evidently been used for a
store and warehouse in more peaceful
times. The surgeon in charge, Major
Havard, stepped forward to greet the
visitors, who formally ' offered him. in
the name of Clara Barton and the Red
Cross, the personal; services of all their
doctors and nurses and any of their
supplies that might be needed. These
were courteously refused. Major Hav
ard thought that .he and his assistants
would be able to take care of all the
3ick ! and wounded, and, as for supplies,
lie knew that there was an abundance
of them on the transports, which he
hoped would be landed next day.
A Sorrowful Scene.
But the sights that met the eyes of
the visitors as they, looked through the
miserable place that bore the name of
hospital did not seem â to warrant the
jheerfulness oÂ£ the doctor* Indeed,' MrÂ»
Oottrell, who tells the story, says they
bmught tears to the eyes of himself and
his companion. "There were a half
dozen cots in a building where there
were perhaps fifty or sixty patients, the
greater number of whom were lying on
the floor, some with a blanket under
them, but a great number were lying
on the bare boards.
"Sheets, pillows and bedclothes were
unknown, but those poor fellows, who
were not dressed in their uniforms,
were lying almost naked. There were
some wounded men and others who
were sick with fever, and in the dim
light of a few lanterns we could see
them turning from side to side in their
discomfort and agony and hear their
moans and, in some cases, imprecations
against the Government that would so
ill provide for such a contingency."
A touch of the grotesque is added to
these horrors by the complacent be
havior of one of the nurses in charge,
who quietly sat out on the veranda in
his shirt sleeves smoking a cigarette.
In answer to inquiries he said, with a
certain regret, that he couldn't do very
much for the boys for two reasons â
first, that he didn't have anything at
hand for them, and, second, because
one nurse couldn't do very much for
forty men, all wanting him at the same
time.
He added that he thought there ought
'to be more help.
"I couldn't," said Mr. Cottrell, "help
contrasting this good natured but
rather indolent chap, who was per
forming his duty in such a careless and
perfunctory manner, with the brave,
clean, intelligent and energetic young
women whom I knew, who, when on
duty, never took a minute's rest, but
were constantly busy; who anticipated
every want of a patient, and who, by
their bright faces and cheerful voices,
drove away all 'eelings of despondency
and homesickness among the sufferers,
and in this way helped them on the
road to recovery quite as much as the
medicine that the doctors might pre
scribe."
Welcomed fry the Cubans.
Rebuffed by their countrymen, the
party turned away with saddened
hearts and entered the Cuban army
hospital near by.
Very different was the reception ac
corded them. General Garcia received
them with his accustomed courtly
bearing, showed them the heartiest cor
dialty, introduced them to the mem
bers of his staff, and in every way
made them feel that they were more
than welcome. He gladly accepted all
proffered aid, saying that his men had
suffered so terribly in the last three
years that he welcomed the coming of

HOW THE PEOPLE
SHOULD GOVERN A CITY
BY MAYOR JOHN C. CHASE Of Haverhlll. Mass.. tbc Only Socialist Mayor in America.
AMERICAN municipalities have long been the
despair of good citizens. I believe that Socialism
holds the key to American municipal problems.
I make the assertion that private ownership
of the means of production, distribution and com
munication is responsible for the Insecurity of subsistance
â and the poverty, misery and degradation of the ever
growing majority of our people, and that the liberty and
happiness of every man. woman and child are conditioned
upon equal political and economic rights, possible of at
. tainment only through the establishment of the co-opera
. tive commonwealth.
While it is not possible for any municipality to guaran
tee to its citizens all their economic rights, I believe that
much can be accomplished in this direction and that every
power the municipality possesses should be placed at the
disposal of the people in the interest of civilization, and
â mankind may progress to a grander and nobler life.
AVith the development of machinery there follows the
displacement of labor, and the concentration of capital
forces into the working classes those of the middle class
â economically unable to compete with the gigantic com
binations of capital that are the features of America's
industrial life.
From these sources there has come a class previously
unknown in societyâ the unemployed, whose existence can
not be denied, and whose rights as human beings require
-the formulation of some immediate plan for their relief.
â While no municipality can hope to solve this great prob
lem, it being a national and ever, an international one,
yet some little relief at least can be afforded by any city
' government.
A tract of land suitable for the raising of food products
â rnn be secured by any city, which can also furnish the
unemployed with tools and seed and permit them to work
.on It. A free fuel yard may be provided. Employment
may be given directly upon public works, not in compe
tition with the regular city employes, but on special works,
such as improvements of park systems and construction of
â  bicycle paths.
The system of contracting with the lowest bidder for
"work performed by the city should no longer be tolerated.
Low bids mean cheap work. Cheap work means cheap
â men and low wages, and low wages lower the standard of
-citizenship.
The city should perform its own work and furnish its
own material, giving employment to its citizens.
In common with every progressive thinker of the nine
teenth century. I believe that a municipality should own
-and operate all public utilities, such as street railroads
and gas and electric light plants. Public ownership of
'public utilities is no longer an experiment. It has been
"successfully practiced in this and other countries, and
-the results have been the minimizing of corruption and

peared to me to be impossible, sheer
nonsense. I made a careful study of
the matter and came to the conclusion
that it was utter rot.
When the matter came up for con-
Bideration the committee asked an In
definite postponement of the resolution.
The league minority opposed this. After
the vote was taken, I then, in the dis
cussion of the resolution itself, demon
strated that it was against public in
terest and public welfare.
Even the introducer of the resolution,
after my exposure of the foolishness of
the scheme, did not dare to vote upon
the question. He asked for a postpone
ment until a report could be had from
the chemist of the Board of Health.
This report more than verified my
statements and the resolution was
never resuscitated. The yellow journal,
however, got back by berating me
soundly in the freedom but not the un
restrained license of the press.
While in office I always held that cor
porations, like Individuals, had their
rights. I was not a party to any dema
gogic grand stand plays. On such occa
sions the Mayor always took the prin
cipal part.
Only to-day I have seen that through
his mouthpiece. Colonel Sullivan, he
stated that he wanted a person who
was competent and upright for the po
sition of gas Inspector. Yet to the last
board he refused to submit the name of
a chemist indorsed by the faculty of
the chemistry department of the Uni
versity of California.
It will be/interesting to note whether
the assessment will be raised on down
town realty merchants and railroad
franchises, in accordance with the
views that were advanced to the former
hoard.
If so the Phelan building, at present
assessed in the neighborhood of $1,000,
--000, but yielding, according to real estate
men. interest at 5 per cent on $3,600,000,
will be raised according to their 60 per
cent valuation an extra million odd dol
lars. This alone in taxes at $1 81 should
give an added revenue to the city of
$18,100.
The question of a fish and game war
den came up at one of our meetings.
The Mayor stated that such a person
would be entirely useless. Yet the rep
resentatives of several shooting clubs,
comprising over 1000 citizens and tax
payers, conclusively demonstrated that
such an official was an absolute neces-
slty.
Evidently the Mayor considers it his
prerogative to change his standpoint
as one would a necktie. The fact that

The exhibit consisted of nothing more
than a few sets of cheap false teeth,
the kind that have rubber instead of
gold-plates to them. What could Mon
golians want with false teeth? As far
as I know such things were entirely
unheard of In the flowery land, and I
could not see what Chinamen would

Large property holders should not be allowed to evade or
dodge their just proportion of taxation because of their

sors extreme care should be taken to select men who will
show no partiality.
Secret sessions and "star chamber" proceedings in City
Councils should be abolished. The people should at all
times know what their public servants are doing, and no
servant who hides his work under the mask of secrecy
is a proper person to be intrusted with the interests of the
people; he stands guilty of the charge of unfairness, ar.Â«l
whether innocent of not, he at least lays himself open to
tlto suspicion of corruption. The guardians of the public
welfare should be at all times willing to openly state their
position on public questions and to have a correct record
of their vote on such questions open to the inspection of
their constituents.
I believe in absolute home rule for municipalities in all
matters not conflicting with the rights of other cities; the
adoption of the initiative and referendum; the imperative
mandate or the right of recall of officials by their con
stituents.
Food and clothing should be supplied to those school
children whose parents are unable to provide for them
that none may be debarred through lack of the necessities
of life from attending school and receiving that training
and knowledge which will make them useful and valuable
citizens in years to come.
Well lighted streets add more beauty to a city, in my
mind that almost any other thing that can be accom
plished in the way of improvements. The truest economy
demand's that the city shall own and operate its own plant,
md thus be able to furnish all the lights that a city may
require at a less cost than might be paid for an Insuffi

ably dissipated his opposition to this
measure.
There is an old adage to the effect
that it is better to teach by example
than precept. Yet during our entire
term the Mayor never Visited the pub
lic offices which duty is prescribed in
the consolidation act.
If he had devoted a little of the ener
gy consumed in advancing demagogic
measures to visiting offices and ascer
taining whether men were attentive to
their duties, there might possibly have
been some diminution of the city's ex
penses. But during his entire regime,
his newspaper and other duties pre
vented his fulfilling this prescribed
duty.
In the last three months of my office
as a member of the Finance Commit
tee I signed hardly any bills, observing
that a possible defeat was ensuing. I
am glad to note that the present board
has supported the Mayor's veto on the
furniture contract of the new Hall of
Justice, or better, Injustice.
By this alone the actual deficit that
exists will be entirely wiped out and
the new board can start in with a clean
page.
There was one ordinance thai I de
termined to make the board nass. But
every time I brought it up they cast
it aside. That was the "high-hat" or
dinance.
I was tired of playing bo-peep with
a feather every time I went to the the
ater. I knew that my fellowmen did
not enjoy two solid hours of millinery
any more than I did. But every time I
brought up the proposed ordinance the
board laughed and passed on to other
business.
After repeatedly casting it aside for
four months they finally passed it.
Constant nagging won. They passed it.
just to quiet me, protesting that it
would be a dead letter. The night the
ordinance was signed I took it over to
Manager Morrissey of the Orpheum.
Placards were printed and conspicu
ously placed in the theater. The next
night every other theater enforced the
"hats-off" law.
That ordinance has brought me just
as many congratulations from ladies as
from gentlemen. Not long ago I sat
behind a lady whose hat, adorned with
nodding plumes completely shutting off
tist. Even the name had an English
sound. Certainly there were a lot of
Chinese hieroglyphics scattered about
the wall, but who could tell what they
meant?
I decided to watch the place for a
while. A lot of Chinamen went up,
but they did not look like dental pa
tients. They were well favored and
dressed, and were evidently bound for
the Shanghai Club, a mysterious and
exclusive institution which occupies
part of the same bulding. But by and
by a young European woman, neatly,
if not fashionably, dressed, went up the
narrow stairway, carrying a baby and
followed by a smart looking Chinese
maid, who seemed to be acting as
guide. A little later a respectably clad
workingman sought the establishment,
and then, emboldened by these exam
ples, I thought it time to offer myself
as a patient.
The narrow stairway brings one with
a sudden twist face to ta.cz with the
closely barred doorway of the Shanghai
Club, which seems to monopolize the
greater part of the building. The place
was not so dirty as it might be, which
is saying a good deal for Chinatown.
âºâ¢But on the other side of the narrow
-passage the door of a cupboardlike
â  room stood open, and from it a cook
emerged, carrying a great wooden tray
âº"filled with strange comestibles, which,
âºafter much ingenious maneuvering, he
âºâ managed to get through the doorway
-of the Shanghai Club. Evidently the
members of this ar'stocratic institu
tion live well. It needed no other
âºâ proof beyond the smell to show that
âº the cupboard was used r-s a kitchen,
I did not penetrate farther into its
dismal depths.
A glass door at the end of the pas
sage led into the dentisfs waiting
-room. It was small and clean, fur-
in strictly European style with
.a few chairs and a table. Here I
[found the workingman waiting his
âºturn.
X "Is Dr. Landon European?" I asked.
h "No, he's a Chinee right enough,
his name sounds like a white
man's."
y "And how do you like being treated
âºby a Chinaman?"
v "Don't like it much."
âº "Then why do you come here?"
"Can't help myself. You see, I'm a
cleaner at the car house, and my wages
âºwon't run to fancy prices. But I've
âº got to get teeth somehow. I knmv a
that had been here, so I came."
X "What has the dentist done to you?"
"See here," and he opened his mouth.
Nearly all the teeth in the lower jaw
âº were gone, and the cavities
âº whence they had been extracted just
over. "He took the teeth out
right enough, and now I'm come to try
on the new plate."
âº Just then the room door of the ope
âº rating-room opened, and the young wo-
Kman with the baby, holding her hand
âºâ to her jaw, emerged. The working
-man went in.
- Presently my turn came, and I found
. myself confronted by a smiling little
'"man, dressed in well cut English
X tweeds. There was not much of the
âº-Chinaman about Landon. At first
- sight, from the manner in which he
wore his foreign clothes I should have
âº"taken him for a Jap. A Chinaman can
âºâ rarely wear "Western garments with
-grace, whereas a Jap takes to them
, with the greatest ease.
The operating room was well lighted
a window looking on Dupont. It was
âº.furnished exactly after the fashion of
-an American dentist's chamber of hor
[rors. There was the same curiously
K shaped chair, with all sorts of devices
hfor raising it up and down, and grip
âºâ phag the patients head as with an iron
l vise. There were the same little steel
. instruments for prodding and poking

would vote in favor and thereby pass

Of course this experience In politics
that I have had is invaluable to me.
My knowledge of men and their meth
ods has been marvelously increased.
It has taught me to turn my back on
official life. If you would learn "ways
that are dark and mysterious" you
needn't study the heathen Chinee. Just
pick out a politician.
But don't learn the legson by becom

worth it. I am probably the most dis

chines, which bore holes with a revolv
ing- drill, and seem to penetrate to the
very base of your skull. These things
were all arranged in the old familiar
way, and excert for a certain shabbi
ness in the furniture, and a certain
stuffiness in the air, I could have imag
ined myself in a dental parlor of the
second rate kind. But an opium-Bcent
ed whiff came now and again from the
Shanghai Club, and rendered a mistake
impossible.
"What you want?" broke In Landon,
astonished at my long silence. He
speaks our language perfectly well, and
it is not necessary to translate his re
marks into that absurd Pigeon-Eng
lish which all Chinamen are popularly
supposed to speak.
It occurred to me that I had better
explain by presence. "Oh, I want soma
teeth." I answered vaguely.
"Well, sit down, let me lpok."
It is not pleasant to have" one's mouth
pulled about by a Chinaman's fingers
but I had to submit. The doctor was
well dressed and looked clean, but still
there is a certain peculiar aroma about
the yellow skin which is most objection
able to us. To be just, Europeans have
also their special scent, which is quite
as JL bJectlonable t0 men of other races.
The dentist, with the aid of his finger
examined my mouth carefully, and then
announced that I should require about
half a dozen teeth in the lower jaw He
would undertake to carry out the work
in quite superior manner for forty dol
lars, with gold plates and everything
else in superfine style. Or he would nut
in a cheap rubber job for fifteen dol
lars.
If you go to an American dentist he
will charge you twice as much," he re
marked, by way of clinching the bar
pain.
I explained that I was short of
money just then, and asked about the
terms of payment.
"I want a deposit of ten dollars "
said Landon, "and the balance on coni
pletion of work."
"Can't I get time; pay it off on tha
Installment plan?"
"Not unless you are In business then
I might give credit; but not to stran
gers."
Landnn understands his business per
fectly well, and is not going to take
any chances when dealing with casual
visitors. He told me that he had
many European patients, most of the
mechanical work he dtd being for
whites. Chinese came mostly for sim
ple operations, such as tooth drawin.tr.
"Do your countrymen ever wear falsa
teeth?" I asked.
"Not in China, but here they are
learning to."
"And -where did you get your experi
ence?
Oh, I learned partly in China, and
then I came here and studied American
methods." I should like to have learned
more, but just then the door bell rang
and Dr. Landon gave me his card"
asked me to call again and bowed me
out with all the grace of a well-fed
Western practitioner.
I visited about half a dozen other
Chinese dentists, but the result was in
every case the same. Their establish
ments cluster thickly around Duoont
and Stockton, between Sacramento and
Jackson street*. They are all on
pretty much the same scale up a flight
or two of narrow stairs, and arranged
to Imitate as closely as may be an
American dental parlor. The furni
ture is more or lees shabby, and the
atmosphere more or less stuffy, accord
ing to the prosperity of the occupant
and the situation of his rooms. Their
charges, also, are pretty much alike
none of th>m varied more than five doll
lars from the price given by the first
dentist I visited.
One man, indeed, a great coarse fel
low, whose place was the dirtiest and
shabbiest of all, offered to make me a
complete set of false teeth for nineteen
dollars, "lubber," or thirty-five dollars
if gold plates were used. I was not
tempted to accept the offer, and has
tened to the nearest chemist to have
my mouth disinfected after the exam

and comparative tables. The chapter
ttery, a simple sketch, was written
by me and Mr. Robertson expected to
find, and did. a kindred spirit, one in
terests <i in his art.
He brought me a collection of articles
made by him in the year 1874 of Cali
fornia clays, some in the "bisque,"
others covered with rich, colored
"glazes."
These pieces, yet in existence, are the
first art pottery specimens made of
native clays.
They are beautiful, varying in text
ure and design.
The thought of founding an art pot
tery for the exclusive use of Californian
materials grew into the most ardent
desire, but was not put to practice then.
Not until after having seen the glori
ous exhibits of American pottery at the
Columbian Exposition in Chicago did
Mr. Robertson and myself make definite
plane to carry out our desired object.
We began by making some plaques,
which I decorated by 'carving" and
"slip-painting." But Mr. Robertson's
aim was to make clay tests, the previ
ous nnes which he had made having be

were 1 not obtainable without going to a
â  deal of trouble and new clays
being easily got.
We rented a small place on Twentieth
street and commenced work In a very
primitive way.
Encouragement we had none.
Unforeseen conditions prevented us
from working as wâ¬- had hoped to and
in the course of time we ceased our
labors to take them up again and â to
cease once more.
But I could not "give up" entirely and
in due time, cheered by fresh hope, we
tried once more.
My experience had taught me that it
would be energy wasted to endeavor
to enlist others in the cause; the time

Nearly a year ago we resumed our

CALIFORNIA`S NEW INDUSTRY
ART POTTERY
''It is of California and her magnificent possibilities, her wonderful resources, I wish to speak. Not of her
golden wheat fields, nor her mines; not her forests of giant trees nor her luscious fruits: not her 'white wings' of the
ocean nor her fruitful vines; not of all the blessings which Providence bestowed, upun this enchanted land as its
birthright â not alone of these, but of one of nature's gift? which nas been left, so to speak, unnoticed almost and
untended. like a modest little tio.ver by the wayside, waiting timidiy for a kind hand to minister to it.
"I am referring to the wonderful clay deposits of this State.
"While millions of dollars yearly are expended on foreign pottery wares, you have right here in this beauti
ful land of your own the wherewith to not only manufacture for all home use, but to send abroad to other coun
tries, as they are sending to us. The clay deposits of the State of California are marvelous in their magnificence
and variety, and only the lamentable lack of enterprise, the prejudice against all 'industry, has left undeveloped
what should years ago have become a generous revenue to this State.
"The exhibit of Roblin art ware at the California Keramic Club exhibitions has proven to the skeptic that
fine pottery, tested by kiln fire, can be made, is being made, from California cl

task to form objects of art and indi

handling flay, with the object in view
of having the work fit to undergo the
ordeal of 'Tiring." I acquired also
through the thnrough teaching of Mr.
Robertson, whom 1 ever found a pa
tient, but exacting master.
ThM? we worked on for months, step
by step, with meager appliances, small
space and most primitive accessories?.
No snorting engine, no clay presses
and mills, no "jiggers" and stumps:
only the old, yet ever new pol
wheel, a "lathe," a few tubs aril sieves,
some boxes for "blungers," lumps of
clay and â our hands!
Ah, PaJiaay! You left an inheritance;
others followed in your footsteps. A
few hundred francs meant to you sal
vation; yet you suffered want. Now
fabulous sunu are paid for supposedly
genuine pieces wrought by your hand.
"The Middleman" was not the crea
tion of the imagination; it only tells
the tale of the poor, almost frenzied
potter who breaks up his scant furni
ture to feed the craving fire holes of his
kiln.
We were ready for our first 'Tiring."
The clays had been washed, dried,
mixed, ripe-Tied and allowed to "rest."
Omar Khayyam could haveâ

Turning round and round,
Without a pau^e. without a sound.
The magic hands of the wizard at
the wheel had formed piece? beautiful
in shape, pure in lines and delicate in
texture, that it almost seemed sacri
lege to decorate them; but individual
thought was banished and here a spray
of blossoms was modeled or painted,
there a design embossed, original, yet
vaguely recalling the crude handiwork
of the Aztec.
There a shapely Grecian ewer was
carved, or a low bowl Dipped and
pinched for two or three supple little
lizards to play hide and seek; or a hat
was hanging up for a rest, the pliant
clay portraying the silky texture of the
delicate wings.
One by one hundreds of dainty pieces
had grown under our hands, until
quite a collection of varied forma hail
accumulated from the chaste Grecian
vase to the irregular, quaint shape dic
tated by a fanciful mind.
Now we were all ready for our first
firing.
The "saggars" or cases made of clay
to hold the fine art ware were at hand;
the potter entered the kiln: one by one
the heavy "saggars" were lifted in to
be filled, according to his never erring
judgment.

a wish for success. Carefully, firmly

The last stroke. I touch the taper

went the Raines, mine timidly, that of
Dave with a roar, the two of the master
just right. Steady, steady.
Over the hills rose the silvery disk of
the moon, like a kindly old friend,
sharing our long vigil.
Noisome fumes and clouds of smoke
filled the air. But it mattered not.
Carefully the fires were being tended,
a draught opened or closed here, there
a fire subdued, until the four burned
all the pleasures of the ordinary in
dividual, who were happy and who
scattered happiness on all who came
near.
Once we set about the work of culti
vating a happy trend in the mind and
it is surprising what possibilities for
happiness will develop within us.
One of the best recipes for happiness
is very old. It is so old many people
have forgotten it.
It ia simply to put aside all thought of
pleasure for yourself, make up your
mind to do the work given you to do
and to accomplish the nearest and most
unpleasant duties first. Then to lose no
chance to give the people who come
across your path all the pleasure and
happiness you can without interfering
with their development.

alike. After hours or watching:, a "test
hole" was opened and little "test pieces"
"drawn" quickly. One from below, one
from above. Every hour this was re
peated, until the potter was satipfied.
At intervals we heard threatening
sounds. "What can it be? The ware?"
"No, not the ware: don't worry."
But we did worry.
In due time one of the "spy holes"
was opened and we had a short glimpse
of the globing Inside. Through an
opening in one of the "saggars" i
Bite the "spy hole" could be seen a
"piece." It appeared safe, so far.
The long night ended and yet the
anxious watch was kept through the
(Jay. The flrea were permitted to "go
down" toward evening, the still ex
panding kiln had to "cool off."
A little spider fell from above and
lighted on my hand. The old super
stition that a "spider at night" brings
luck came to my thought. Tenderly I
tucked it away under a rose leaf. "Hide
away, little spider, and return on the
eve of to-morrow to bring us luck."
Another night passed and toward
evening of the second day I was given
the privilege of "opening" the kiln.
Enough of the bricks and clay were re
moved to make an opening just large
enough to take out the pieces put in
last.
For care must be taken not to admit
too much co.d air.

completely knocked out the mi-sery-pro

GIANT UMBRELLA
FOR THE PARIS EXPOSITION
RE. SHERMAN*, a Chicago electrician and inventor, ceived word yes
terday from George Pangelo, Commissioner Peck's secretary of.Amer
i ican concessions for t Paris Exposition, that "Sherman's umbrella"
is now practically certain of getting'a place on the Exposition grounds.
â¢Sherman's umbrella" is the designation given to a mechanical device
intended to rival the Ferris wheel, and Mr. Pangelo has promised to no
tify the inventor by cablegram as soon as the concession is secured.
The name of the device invented by' Mr. Sherman was suggested by the
resemblance which his model bore to the frame of an umbrella. The ac
tual planning of the thing was intrusted to a practical mechanical engineer,
R. H. Hinchliff, who planned the Manufactures building at the Columbian
Exposition.
The idea of it is to carry passengers to a great height overlooking the
Exposition grounds. The plans call for a steel structure 350 feet high and
2no feet in diameter from car to car when the cars are at the top. Ten
cars are planned, each capable of accommodating fifty passengers. Mr.
Sherman says that the cars can make three trips every hour, which will
admit of their carrying more passengers in that time than the Ferris wheel
did, because all the cars can be loaded at one trip.
The cars are to be supported at the ends at ten long steel cables, which
are to run over the ends of the arms or staves of the "umbrella." The
power is to be applied from the platform around the central column. The
platform is intended to move up and down the column and to carry 350
passengers. The power by which It is expected to move the platform and
to lower and raise the cars is hydraulic pressure. Another motion is also
provided for in the plans. That is a rotary motion of the platform, carry,
ing with it the cars, and that motion is to be carried out by a separate ap
plication of electrical power.
Mr. Sherman says that not as much power will be required to run the
machine as is required to operate the Ferris wheel, because the weight of
each car filled with passengers is utilized as a counterbalancing power of
gravity over the pulleys at the ends of the arms.
The application for a site was made for grounds opposite the Champ de
Mars, where the Paris Ferris wheel is now in operation. The Paris wheel
is forty feet higher than the Chicago wheel.
a long time after it had become epi
demic in many other places, and pos
sibly might have escaped altogether if
the rain had only come a little sooner.
As it was, though, the long, dry season
that had prevailed left everything in
such condition that the germs grew
with frightful rapidity after they once
ptaited. The result vras that the doc
tors soon found themselves with their
hands full and the Board of Health was
confronted with a serious problem.
The cases of la grippe that might
have existed in Alameda before the be
ginning of this year were certainly very
few and attracted no attention what
ever. Two days later every doctor in
town had to work almost day and
night. There seemed to be a case in al
most every house, and new ones were
reported as rapidly.
It was apparent that something had
to be done, and done quickly. The
Board of Health was equal to the emer
gency and at once procured a large
number of portable formaldehyde gas
furnaces. These are acknowledged to
be the most powerful disinfecting ma
chlnes in existence. Large quantities
of formaline tablets, formaline liquid
and methyl alcohol were also procured,
and instructions given to use plenty in
every case.
From the first the board realized that
to do the work effectively It must be
done thoroughly. To this end several
â¢if the furnaces were placed at the ser
vice of physicians, who used them in
houses where they had patients. This
immediately put a check on the disease
in that place, as it killed all the germs
in the- house and so prevented the well
people from carrying' them out and dis
tributing them about the town.
The work done by the Board of
Health was principally precautionary,
although Dr. McLean, the Health Of
ficer, had a large number of cases that
required the same handling as was done
by physicians in their private practice.
The first public work done was to dis
infect all the omces in the City Hall.
This was done by bringing. the formal
dehyde furnaces into the rooms at
night, closing doors and windows tight
and starting the apparatus. In less
than an hour the rooms were so full of
gas as to make it impossible for any
body to remain in them. The gas was
allowed to remain in the rooms all
night, in which time it penetrated into
every crevice and killed every germ
that lurked there. In the morning the
doors were opened and the odor of the
gas passed away.
All public halls were treated the same
way. The Public Library was the
biggest undertaking, as the room is
enormous. Several furnaces were used
and nearly 3000 formaldehyde pastils
consumed. Th" material used in do
ing this work cost about $15.
Several merchants obtained the use
of the formaldehyde furnaces and disin
fected their Btores. People who had
no sickness also borrowed the machines
and disinfected their homes merely as
a precautionary measure. In this con
nexion it is Interesting to note that not
a single case of la grippe haÃ been re
ported from these houses.
It seemed for two or three days that
all of Alameda was being disinfected.
The odor of the eas huner h-^ivy nn
the air, but nobody minded that, for
the dread disease was being conquered.
i.'. < '. Maillot, the sanitary Inspector,
has had charge of most of the work
of disinfecting, and it has kept him
busy.
"I don't know how many cases of
grippe we had," he said, when speaking
of the matter, "but there were a good
many. And they all came on us sud
denly. I don't think there were any
more than we had at the last visit of
the disease, but they seem more, as
they all came in a bunch. Two weeks
ago we hardly heard of la grippe, ex
cept that it was bad in some other city.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1899.
Never in the history of
California has a municipality
taken the steps to stamp out
a disease that Alameda has
taken during the last two
weeks. And Alameda has
conquered. Like other cities
of the State Alameda re
ceived a visit from the grip
scourge. Owing to the long
dry weather that had previ
ously prevailed, the disease
established a strong foothold
and spread rapidly. Hut the
Eoard of Health was equal
to the occasion, and at once
procured a number of the
most modern disinfecting
machines. Then began a
systematic fumigating of all
public buildings, offices, the
library, reading rooms and
schoo's with formaldehyde
gas. In the laboratory of
the Eoard of Health one
apparatus was kept working
all the time, and whoever
wished had the privilege of
entering and being disinfected
of any germs that might bÂ»
clinging to his clothing.
This was a precautionary
public measure that has
p-oved valuable. In a week
the disease was under con
trol and it is now almost
entirely stamped out, as only
cne or two new cases have
been reported in the last three
days.
Then suddenly we were swamped with
cases.
"Dr. MeLeap had to work almost day
and night. We used pounds of quinine
and pills in the office on city cases, and
still the malady got worse and worse.
"Then we got the formaldehyde fur
naces and disinfected everything we
could and soon had the disease under
cotitroL New it is practically stamped
out.
"One of the clerks In an office in the
City Hall seemed to have a touch of
the disease and he asked to be allowed
to stay in one of the rooms a whilo
during the time of disinfection. I d"on't
know whether it did him any good or
not, but it certainly prevented him
from carrying any of the germs around
with him, because it killed any that
may have been in his clothes.
"Then other people asked for the
privilege of being disinfected and, of
course, it was permitted. It is not ex
actly a pleasant sensation, but is un
doubtedly a powerful killer of microbes
in clothing. And if we cun prevent
germs being carried about in this way
we can soon check the disease. Did
you ever see the apparatus work?"
Mr. Maillot then led the way to the
VOUNDED NINETEEN TIMES. IN ONE BATTLE.
FRANK KENNEDY, now in Kansas city, was wound
ed nineteen times in the battle of Santiago de Cuba.
He walks with crutches, since his right leg, broken
six times, is still a little tender, but he hopes soon
to be able to discard them, when he will again
enter Uncle Sam's service, this time as a regular.
"I was in Guthrie, O. T., when the war broke out," said
Mr. Kennedy. "Two brothers of the name of Otto and
James Wi/Bon and I were going to the Klondike. We had
our tiolcett, to the Pacific Coast already bought and paid
for; then came the call for volunteers, so we sold our
tickets to a scalper and enlisted. Little did I think then
that eight months later I would be a claimant for a pen
sion, with my picture in the newspapers looking like the
diagram of a panicky day on the Board of Trade. But I
have long since ceased being surprised at anything.
"I was a sergeant in Troop F of the First Texas Volun
teer Cavalry, commanded by Colonel Wood. On July 3, the
second day of the battle, I was serving as mounted orderly
for General Lawton. Early in the afternoon, while carry
ing a dispatch from him to General Wheeler's headquar

It there were Spaniards all around me, yelling like Cnman

laboratory. The air was heavy with
a gas that made the eyes water and
smart. A few people were standing
about, undergoing the heroic treatment
merely as a precautionary measure.
"Let me put in a few more pastils,"
said Mr. Maillot, lifting up one of the
furnaces. He then took about a doz^n
small, white disks that had much the
appearance of candy and dropped them
into the top of the furnace.
Instantly a faint white vapor could
be seen issuing from the opening, and
soon it spread all through the room.
Gradually as the paste in the pastils
was consumed they disappeared. Then
there was a smarting of eyes and a
coughing. But there was no physical
effect as far as weakness was con
cerned.
"When I am disinfecting a room I
use it much stronger. But for this
purpose a mild strength is just as ef
fective because we can only expect to
kill the germs in the cjothing. Dozens
of people underwent this treatment,
and it undoubtedly went a long way
toward checking the disease.
"At any rate we now have la grippe
under control. No new cases have been
reported to-day and but one yesterday.
"We have also had a large number of
diphtheria cases to look out for. Quin
zy has also been very bad, but now
there seems to be an end of them. The
disinfecting apparatus has been used
wherever possible, and â  I am sure it
has been the means of saving us from
a big epidemic. The citizens have all
been anxious to aid us in our work.
That we have done so well has been
entirely due to new scientific meth
ods."

In connection with the important
work just done by formaldehyde gas in
Alameda it is interesting to note the
following discovery just made in re
gard to its properties by Dr. Ernest
Pillsbury, of the College of Physicians
and Surgeons.
"I have done a great deal of work
with formaldehyde gas,"- said Dr. Pills
bury, "and have read a great deal of
literature on the subject, but I have
never heard that it had the power of
producing immunity from infection as
well as being a disinfectant.
"That it has this power I discovered
accidentally a few days ago while
working in my laboratory. And it
seems perfectly natural that such
should be the case if you stop to think
a moment.
"I had a lot of gelatine plates with
disease cultures on them that I did not
want. I destroyed them by the fumes
of formaldehyde *ras. It so happened,
though, that there were also a number
of fresh plates in the room. That is.
the pure gelatine plate in which no dis
ease cultures had been planted.
"The next day I planted some cul
tures in those plates and put them in
the incubator. To my surprise the cul
tures did not grow aX all. It took me
some time to find out what was the
matter. It then dawned on me that
the plates wore immune. That I am
right in this t have since proved by
experiment, and know positively that
whatever is touched by formaldehyde
gas is immune to any vegetable bac
teria, such as that of la grippe."
S. H. Rosenthal and Dr. S. J. yon
Kourocki have been for the last three
years working together in Berlin in the
endeavor to discover the means of mak
ing a non-poisonous match which would
strike anywhere. To Mr. Rosenthal be
longs the credit of finding a paste for
match heads which is not poisonous,
which is readily ignited on any rough
surface and which gives off no fumes
or smell. The use of phosphorus in the
manufacture of matches often gives the
factory operatives a horrible disease,
decay of the jawbone, sometimes called
"phossy jaw."
Like many other tremendous discov
ally taking an inventory of my wounds. I found I had been
shot four times and cut twice with machetes.
"A quarter of a mile farther on I ran into another
bunch, and again I had to run the gauntlet. The proceed
ing of three minutes before was repeated. I emptied my
revolver, .and put my horse to his highest speed. This time
I was shot three times and received four cuts from ma
chetes, which brought the total number of wounds up to
thirteen.
"After this second adventure I had ridden about a mile.
I guess, when a shell burst near by, killing my horse
and breaking my right leg below the knee in six places. I
fell to the ground, where I lay until 4 o'clock the next
afternoon. It was 2 o'clock when the shell burst.
"Shortly afterward I was placed on board a hospital ship
and taken to New York. While I was still on the ship in
New York harbor Major Armstrong, formerly surgeon ma
jor of the Second Kansas National Guard, Â«â¢ which I had
been a member, came on board and recognized me, and
by his orders I was transferred to the hospital at Fort
Thomas, Ky. Here I was given the very best of medical
and surgical attention. I believe the surgeons took special
pride in bringing me out whole, as I was so badly cut up."
The World of October 20, 1898, published a diagram
somewhat similar to that which accompanies this article,
pointing out the wounds received by Fritz Woelk, a vet
eran of the Franco-Prussian war, nor a grocer at 420 East
Eighteenth street. But since Mr. Woelk was wounded only
six times, he must yield the palm to Mr. Kennedy, who goes
him thirteen better.â Kansas City Times.

eriesr"this one was made accidentally. I
am not at liberty to divulge the nature
of the experiments during which .Mr.
Rosenthal made it. But at all events it
was one which proves that "peace hath
her victories no less renowned than
war." The discovery of the Invention
having been achieved it was submitted
to the well-known assayists, Messrs.
Johnson, Matthey & Co., Limited, Hat
ton Garden, who declared that the
match contains no trace of yellow phos
phorus. Mr. Castle told me that al
ready provisional patents had been
taken out for the United Kingdom and
eleven foreign countries. Considering
that the discovery was only made on
the Ist of this month this is pretty
smart work.
"And how do you propose to develop
this discovery?" I asked. "Well, we
don't propose to develop it ourselves;
we are content with taking out the pat
ents. We are thoroughly assured that
the invention fs a sound and practical
one, and we expect to be approached
by one or the other of the leading
match manufacturers â that is to say, if
they are honest in their intention of
adopting a process of manufacture
which will do away with the use of yel
low phosphorus, and of that I should
say there can be little doubt."
Some time ago, it may be added, the
Belgian Government offered a prize to
the inventor who would produce a
match which fulfilled the following con
ditions: It must not contain phos
phorus or other poison; it must not
give off poisonous gases in combustion;
OVER 100 YEARS OLD,
ACCORDING TO HER TRIBE
Â° 800-TCHI-KA, the Indian
o Won)an who Is Said to
o Be 130 Years Old.
On the North Fork of Cache Creek, in
Lake County, California, there lives an
old withered Indian woman, 800-Tchi-
Ka by name, who is popularly supposed
to be at least 130 years old. She was a
very old woman in 1850, when Lieuten
ant Lyons punished the Indians of that
county for the murder of Stone and
Kelsey, two early settlers on Clear
Lake. "Old ZeV an Indian who is over
100 years of age, is the youngest son of
800-Tchi-Ka, who had a family of
eight children, all of whom are long
dead except Zeb. Zeb's great-grandson
is a man over 50 years of age, and his
own numerous years are pretty well
proven by records and the memories of
many old white people who when chil
dren knew "Old Zeb" and hi? phenom
enally aged mother. 800-Tchi-Ka is
totally blind and deaf and for years has
made no effort at communication with
any one. She cannot walk without as
sistance, and is cared for most kindly
by her tribespeople, who regard her
with supertstitious awe.
* * â¢
SINCE the death of old "Vaquero" a
few days ago the oldest Indian now
living in the Monterey County
Almshouse is "Old Parito," a Yaqui In
dian, who first saw the light of day
over a hundred years ago. The real
name of this Indian is not known, even
to his best friends now living. Thoae
who once knew it are all deal and the
present generation has never been able
to learn it. For some reason best known
to himself he refuses to tell.
Old Parito was a full-grown man
when the Mexicans rebelled against
Spanish rule in 1810. He was then
known as a young man, but he fought
with his tribe in that war, and says
it must strike everywhere. These con
ditions Mr. Rosenthal and his partner
claim to have fulfilled, and, moreover,
they claim that their matches can v>->
manufactured as cheaply as the- ordi
nary ones and by the same machinery
and staff.
There is no excuse, therefore, for any
manufacturer of "phossy jaw" matches
to hesitate in giving this new discovery
a trial.
A costermonger was in great trouble.
His little son was dead. The bishop en
deavored to comfort him to the best of
his power. Rocking to and fro in dis
tress of mind, he suddenly looked at the
bishop, and, with tears running- down
his cheeks, said: "D'ye think I could
get the young beggar stuffed? '
proudly that he did his share of the
work.
When the Mexicans had gained their
independence he, with the rest of his
tribe, claimed equal privileges with the
victors. As this was not granted a
general uprising occurred and a war
that only ended a few years ago be
gan. Parito took part in this fighting
but when certain rights had been ob
tained he emigrated to what was then
known as , T pper California.
This was in 1827, and he resided here
until the war with the United States
occurred in 1848. When thj goid fever
broke out he worked in the mines, but
was too feeble to do very much when
he came in competition with the
younger men. At that time he was
about 60 years of age.
He says he has a sister named Anna
Maria Vaquero, living on the Yaqui
River, who has property belonging to
him. She is his youngest sister and
was 100 years old when he last heard
from her.
As I was leaving I asked Parito
what he thought of the war between
the United States and Spain. His re
ply was: "I have seen that country
(Spain) own nearly every Toot of land
south of this country and the greater
part of this country itself. I have seen
her lose all: I have helped her to loss
some. I can now die happy."KING OF COUNTERFEITERS

man clever, cultured Old widely
known. He was a philanthropist to the
bounds of fxtravagance, patriotic be
yond the measure of the ordinary man.
His name was Hitter vo* Boor. He
came from a poor but nob> family and
had a lineage roeval with that of Em
perior Franz Josef himself.
As an opulent landlord the chevalier
was without an equnl in Austria. He
was the founder of the 7ienna Building
Bark and the prime promoter of the
Donau Steamship Company. Like Mae
cenas he was a most Indulgent patron
of the fine arts and aelles lettres. He
established asylums for orphans and
the indigent aged and was considered
the foster father of all the sick and the
destitute.
At the prime time this saintly man, ln
ventor and geniui, was the most suc
cessful forger aad counterfeiter that
ever operated in a civilized country.
He was born in Austrian Flanders in
IS2O. At a very early age he became an
orphan and feli into the hands of some
of his near relatives. They sent him to
a college, where he began to manifest a
decided leaning: toward art. To culti
vate this penchant for sketching he
withdrew to a school at Orwald in
Flanderi, aad later to the Academy of
Art in I'aris.
His small income being cut off by the
death of his uncle, the chevalier retired
to the little Austrian village of Klagen
furt. Her' he dropped th>- aristocratic
appendage to his name and subscribed
himself merely Maximilian Boor. After
a few months' struggle to obtain em
ployment suitable to his talents, and
meeting with sorry success, he chanced
upon r charming young milliner, whom
he wedded after a brief courtship.
To raise funds for their sustenance
the young husband turned his artistic
bent 't" good use in painting portraits,
while his pretty wife still continued to
work at the millinery trade. Altogether
it was ;i precarious living, even at its
best, and there can be little doubt that
it was at this period that Boor, goaded
by unsatisfied appetites, began to seek
a'means of bettering his fortunes by il
legu 1 methods.
After enduring more than the usual
share of adversity Boor suddenly met
â with an affliction that frightened him.
He began to lose his sight to a degree
â w r ere the discernment of colors became
in-possible to him. His means of liveli
hood came to a sudden end. But con
trary to the usual run of mankind the
artist did not despair.
Shortly alter this affliction it began to
be noticed by the curious neighbors
that times were bettering for the Boors.
He who bad been but a mediocre paint
er soon developed into a business man
Of the highest order. The little millin
ery shop seemed to be a veritable gold
mine, of course in a town of limited
size this sudden acquisition of wealth
caused a ripple of curiosity. However,
no one suspected that the gold which
the artist so generously handled had an
illegal origin.
Five years later Boor, who had set foot
in the town a penniless knight, rose to
the rank of its most opulent citizen. He
purchased several mansions which he
furnished most sumptuously. He began
also to take a hand in large business
transactions and acquired no little fame
as a financier of the first order.
The domestics in the mansion, how
ever, began to consider their master
v> ry erratic, if not demented. They
told in whispers how he would seclude
himself for days at a time in a dark
ened chamber, doing no one knew what.
But to the wiser and more important
citizens of Klagenfurt no shadow of a
suspicion of any evildoing ever came.
At this period Yon Boor began to feel
the restrictions a residence in the coun
try imposed and h^ Â«lghed for a larger
field of action. Finally he departed
with his wife for Vienna. There he
launched out in the schemes that made
his name a part of the industrial and
commercial history of Austria.
He began a life of unexampled splen
dor by purchasing the magnificent do
mains of Auf der Mauer and Koenigs
foerde, near Erlau, for six million gul
den. He associated with the elite of
the capital and his home soon became
a rendezvous for the devotees of art
and the sciences. Among those whom
Boor especially favored were engrav

time, came to bear a wonderful signi
ficance In later times.

WALTER BESANT`S OPINION
OF DOOMSDAY PROPHETS
THERE lies before me a document of the most surprising kind. It is
the manifesto of a prophet. He is a surviving specimenâ one hopes
the last â of a whole class which were numerous thirty years ago. At
that time they were engaged upon the Great Horn and the Little Horn
âthe second advent and the end of the world. The Emperor Napo
leon was the beast. He was going to overrun all Europe in the year 1870.
Poor man. he was overrun himself in that year. The second advent would
follow, with the end of the present order and the millennium.
I have a book published about the year 1866, in which these coming
events are set forth with great precision. And some people still remember
the prophet of Crown Court, the Rev. Dr. Cumming, who kept his flock in a
continual state of feverish expectation of what was going to happen and
never did. And there were many others.
My present prophet is a successor of those eminent seers and foretellers.
What he tells us is that the end of the present order cannot possibly be
delayed mure than a few months; and he proves it up to the hilt. At least,
he Fays so, in effect. How does he prove it?
Very simply. The number "six" is, he says, the "perfect" number;
perfect, that is. in evil. What this means I cannot tell you; nor what
any number can have to do with the round world and all that therein is.
He" goes on to illustrate this property of the number "six" by recalling the
fact that the creation of the world took six days. So that, contrary to
Revelation, the creation of the world was the supreme evil! Again, how
can the duration of rroation by days have any effect upon the future his
tory of mankind? Are we governed by charms and talismans? Then, after
â¢ six comes sfven. which is the "perfect" number, <>r the number of "perfect"
good. Why? Because th<- day of rest was the seventh? Why should the
number of the day, reckoning from the first, have any effect upon the future
history of mankind? My friend does not explain.
But see how the numbers come In! In two or three days, by the old
chronologers, 6000 years will have passed away since the creationâ the sev
enth thousand will begin. Therefore the old order will change, and the
millennium, or period of sabbatical rost, will begin. But why after 6000 more
. than after 600, or 60, or 60,000? The prophet does not explain, and, as to
that chronology which assigns 4004 B. C. as the date of creation, we row
know that before that period there was a flourishing kingdom with civiliza
tion and ordor of its own in Egypt and another In Babylonia. But this, of
course, is below the notice of a prophet.
In a word, we have here a piece of fanatical nonsense worthy of the
days of Venner and his fifth monarchy men. All the follies, all the enthu
siasms, all the perversions remain. We think we have outlived them, and
lo! they are with us again.

even clipped the noble "yon" from his
name owing, of course, to the obscurity
into which he was cast by his few years
of poverty. Ignorant of this fact, how
ever, his many friends imparted to
Boor their opinions as to the proba
bility of the Emperor conferring a pa
tent* of nobility on him. Thinking the
time opportune for a resumption of hi<*
titles Ritter procured his papers from

his old Flemish home and thereafter
his station among the nobility became
defined and undisputed. Simultaneously
he won the hand of a daughter of the
Prince yon Rosenberg-Orsini. All doors,
even those of the imperial Hofburg,

Shortly subsequent' to this important
event Boor's father-in-law died, leaving
in the hands of the fortunate Chevalier
the castles of Rossegg, Teutendorf and
Rosenbach and the palatial villa ol

an inordinate pride for beautiful estates
the knight consumed one-half million
of gulden in embellishing these newly
acquired possessions. The man whom

reached the zenith of success.
At about this date he published his

MRS. EDDY'S DEFENSE
OF CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
MRS. MARY BAKER G. EDDY,
the founder of Christian Sci
ence, has been reading some
of the many recent attacks on
that school, anent the death
of Harold Frederic, and has come out
in a letter in its defense. Mrs. Eddy
refers at the beginning of her letter
to an article that appeared in the New-
York Times. Harold Frederic was, it
will be remembered, the London corre
spondent of the Times, and that paper
has been foremost in the recent attack
upon the Christian Scientists. The edi
torial to which Mrs. Eddy specifically
replies, contains such passages as,
"Why is it not possible to suppress
these murderous fanatics in this coun
try?" and, "Why are they not ar
rested?"
The words which call out Mrs.
Eddy's reply occurred in the following
paragraph:
"Why not enforce the law against
these homicidal charlatans who prac
tise their hocus-pocus on patients sick
with typhoid fever, heart disease and
consumption? They kill, and, so far,
kill unpunished. Not one of them could
pass the regents' examination. It
would catch them all, and they would
be delivered over to the law if they
practiced and took fees without a
license. The experience of Massarhu
setts shows that it may be difficult to
draft a statute that will net these pests.
Common sense shows that new legisla
tion is not needed. Existing law will
protect the ignorant from their deadly
impostures if it be enforced."
Here, in part, is Mrs. Eddy's reply;
"In a New York paper an article was
published November 25, 1898, in which
Christian Scientists were called 'pests.'
That epithet points a moral. Jewish
pagans thought the learned St. Paul,
the Mars Hill orator, the canonized
saint, was a 'pestilent fellow,' but to
day all sorts of institutions flourish
under the name of this 'pestilent fel
low.' Of old Pharisees and hypocrites
said of the great master of meta
mense quantities at his country cha
teau so that the amount in circulation
might not be diminished.
The Emperor himself did not disdain
to be found as a guest at Castle Kalten
brunn, 1 nor was his Majesty sparing in
his encomiums on the wealth of his
host, the beauty of his wife and other
kindred subjects. Little, however, did
the Emperor suspect the secret of Yon
Boor's good luck.
In the year of 1879 the chevalier's
star began its descent. The old oph
thalmic disease returned. An oculist of
much renown, Professor Rosas, per
formed an operation on his eyes and
succeeded in saving one from blindness.
But this remaining eye was so weak
that the unfortunate counterfeiter was
forced to forego labor of every kind
that necessitated the use of sight.
Lacking his master hand Yon Boor's
business interests began to suffer ma
terially. Owing to the lack of funds
which he could no more manufacture
loss upon loss followed. At first public
attention was not attracted, so slow
physics, 'He is a stirrer up of seditions,'
and because they could find no fault
in him they vented their hatred of him
in opprobrious epithets; but what
would be thought to-day of a man that
should call St. Paul "pestilent," and
what will be thought to-morrow of him
who shall call Christian Scientists
'pests'? Again, what, indeed, shall be
said of him who saith the Savior of
men, the healer of men, the Christ, the
truth, "is a stirrer-up of seditions'?
"What most concerns the world in all
ages is, that men suspend judgment
and sentence on the pioneers of Chris
tianity until they know of what and of
whom they speak. A person's ignor
ance of Christian Science is a sufficient
reason for his silence on the subject;
but what can atone for the vulgar de
nunciation of what a man knows ab
solutely nothing about?
"I challenge the world to disprove
what I hereby declare. After my dis
covery of Christian Science I healed
consumption in its last stages that the
M.Ds., by verdict of the stethoscope
and the schools, declared incurable, th<
lungs being mostly consumed. I healed
malignant tubercular diphtheria and
carious bones that could be dented by
the linger, saving them when the sur
geon's instruments were lying on the
table ready for their amputation. I
have healed at one visit a cancer that
had so eaten the flesh of the neck as
to expose the jugular vein so that it
stood out like a cord.
"In what sense is the Christian Sci
entist a 'pest'? Is it because he minds
his own business more than the aver
age man, is not a brawler, an alcohol
drinker, a tobacco-user, a profane
swearer, an adulterer, a fnrnieator, nor
a dishonest politician or business man?
Or is it because he is the very antipode
of all these? In what sense is the Chris
tian Scientist a charlatan? Is it be
cause he heals the sick without drugs?
Well, our best examplar, the Nazarene
prophet, healed through mind, and
commanded his followers to do likewise.
The prophets and apostles and Chris
tians in the first centuries healed the
sick as a token of their Christianity.
Has Christianity improved upon its
earlier records, or has it retrograded?
Compare the lives of its present profesl
cora with those of its followers at the
beginning of the Christian era and you
have the correct answer-
Meteoric Career in Crime of an Austrian
Noblemanâ Has Just Died After Being
Released From Prison by the
Emperor's Clemency.
were the graduations of his ruin, but
finally as the unhappy man began to
sacrifice his beautiful estates in an ef
fort to avoid financial collapse much
wonderment ensued.
Five years later an alignment was
made. Nothing remained of that co
lossal fortune but a palace on the Jae
gerzeile. in Vienna, and a few scat
tered estates. The news of this event
went worldwide. Much sympathy was
accorded the chevalier, and it must
have caused a curious smile to rise on
his care-worn face when his secretaries
read to him from the daily journals the
columns touching on his financial dis
tress, where, above all. his sterling hon
esty was roundly praised.
Many of the following years were
spent in poverty, all the more dire be
cause a certain nobility of action had
to be maintained. The last florin of
his wife's fortune was about consumed
when, owing to the treatment that had
been recommended to him, his remain
ing eye recovered to such a degree as
to permit him to try counterfeiting
again.
In a very brief time the chevalier re
turned to Vienna. The high life of
former days was resumed, much to the
amazement of all who knew him. It
was supposed at the time that Emperor
Franz Josef, out of commiseration
for him, for his misfortunes had ac
corded him some practical assistance.
No one suspected the truth, but the
denouement was not far distant.
In 1880 the officials of the
Vienna First Savings Bank be
came cognizant of the fact that

"As a pertinent Illustration of this
general subject under discussion, I will
cite a modern phase of medical practice,
namely, the homeopathic system, to
which the old school has become recon
ciled. Here I speak from experience.
In homeopathy the highest attenua
tions of medicine have nÂ«>t an iota (if
the drug left in them, and the lower
attenuations have so little that a vial
full of the pellets are swallowed with
out harm and without appreciable ef
fect, whereas the homeopathist ad
ministers half a dozen or less of thesc
same globules, and tells you, and you
will believe him, that therewith he
heals the sick. This, however, does not
disprove the efficacy of the system. It
enhances it, for it identifies it with
mind, not matter, in the grooves of
God, in the hands of Omnipotence. And
say, O petty scorner of the Infinite!
canst thou mock His miracles or scat
ter His shade who 'abideth under the
shadow of the Almighty'?
"The homeopathist handles in hi.Â«
practice, and is supposed to heal, the
most violent stages of organic Inflam
matory disease, to stop decomposition,
to remove enteritis, gastritis, gastral
gia, hyperemia, pneumonia, diphtheria
and ossificationâ the effects of calcare
ous salts formed by carbonate and sul
phate of lime; and the homeopathic
physician succeeds in healing his cases
without drugs equally with the allo
path, who depends uoon drugs. Then, is
mind or matter the intelligent factor
in pathology? If matter, I challenge
matter to act apart from mind; and if
mind, I have proved beyond cavil that
the action of mind is curative and po
tent in proportion as it acts untram
meled by matter. Hence our Master's
saying, 'The flesh praflteth nothing.'
The difference between metaphysics in
homeopathy and metaphysics in Chris
tian Science consists in this forcible
fact: The former enlists faith in the
pharmacy of the human mind, and the
latter couples faith with understanding,
and is based on the Divine mind, know
ing that this mind is omnipotent, is in
finite, is all â hence it is the sovereign
appeal, and there is nothing therein to
attenuate. The more of this mind the
better for both physician and patient.
"Ignorance, slang and malice touch
not the hem of the garment of Chris
tian Scientists, for once touching it
they would be destroyed."
of 10 and 100 gulden were being floated
by som,e unknown but masterly hand.
They secretly notified Chief of Detec
tives Felsenthal. The case presented
many difficulties, which were of a novel
character to the Vienna detective, but
with the instinct of his kind he set him
self to work and did not relinquish his
efforts until he had his prisoner behind
the prison walls.
A theory which at first seemed very
plausible to Felsenthal was that the
spurious currency had its origin outside
of the Austrian empire. This theory
soon proved untenable. The next step
was to order a close watch on all the
first-class engravers in Vienna. The
utility of this was shown by the fact
that the work on the greenbacks could
have been executed only by a man who
was an ade "t of the highest order. De
spite the keenest vigilance, the nefar
ious work still went on.
Informations were then sent to the
business men of the city as to the
method of detecting the true from the
counterfeit bills. There was but one
mar which the half-blind knight had
overlooked in his handiwork. To the
expert eye an irregularity in the water
marks was plainly perceptible. Being
apprised of this fact, the shopkeepers
were also instructed to bring to police
headquarters any one, no matter what
his station or degree in life, who passed
one of the counterfeits.
One day after this ste-p an elderly
gentleman of very dignified aspect was
caught paying for a watchchain with a
note of the spurious kind. Upon exami
naton he very readily explained how he
came into the possession of it and was
liberated without being requested to
leave his name. This man was Yon
Boor. Many other shoppers were
brought in to the police, but their hon
esty was easily proven. Among the
many Madame yon Boor was detected
paying a bill with the worthless paper.
Her replies were, however, very satis
factory.
These several arrests of the Yon
Boors prompted Felsenthal to take a
trip of investigation to their villa at
Meidling. The detective's clever prob
ing elicited some suspicions and facts
which were the foundation of Boor's ar
rest.
Felsenthal returned to Vienna with
the firm conviction that the chevalier
was at least one of the distributors of
the notes.
The report which the detective hand
ed in to the authorities met with de
rision. A few days later, however, the
new cook at the villa informed the po
lice that her employer showed all the
indications of insanity. He would se
clude himself in a certain barred room
for days at a time, neither eating nor
sleeping, and had followed this custom
for many months.
Upon receipt of this report the Min
RAMON LALA'S IDEA
OF FILIPINOS AS CITIZENS
Special to the Sunday Call.
THK Government and all the con
ditions of life of 7,000,000 men,
women and children, inhabitants
of the Philippine Islands, have
been profoundly affected by the
decision of the Paris peace com
mission. It is a little singular that,
while the disposition of the islands has
been thoroughly discussed from the
point of view of the Americans, the
English, the Germans and the Japan
ese, the Filipino has hardly been con
sulted as to his desires and inclinations
regarding the future. Ramon Reyes
Lala, a native of the Philippine Isel
ands, educated in England and now
temporarily a resident of the United
States, who is thoroughly familiar with
the conditions in the Philippines, ap
pears as the champion of his people,
and in the following article he makes
some exceedingly valuable suggestions
for the future government of the Phil
ippines, showing vividly the needs and
hops of his countrymen:
There has been not a little curiosity
shown by the American public as to
the future of the Filipino, and not a
few wiseacres have croaked most dole
fully about his worth as a citizen. I
therefore wish to show that my coun
trymen are not as black as they have
been painted and that there is enough
stamina in the race to warrant cultiva
tion and a high citizenship.
True, we have no world genius to
show you, we have no grand literature,
no distinct national art â but there are,
I think, enough evidences of our capac
ity for these things to cause Americans
to give us a genuine Yankee welcome.
For opportunity to prove ourselves,
our manhood, our talents and our hopes
is all that we feel entitled to. Let the
American people help us to a realiza
tion of this long-desired opportunity,
and they will win our eternal gratitude.
We have, I repeat, already given evi
dence of a capacity for civic functions.
Though living amid the most discour
aging conditions and under the most
oppressive government in the civilized
world, my countrymen have ever
proved tractable and law-abiding,
where the law was based upon equity
and right. Nay. they have done more
than this.
But it is not upon this capacity to re
ister of Justice, Count Sedlnitzky or
dered the villa to be searched. En
graver's tools, magnifying glasses, inks
and brushes were discovered in abund
ance. The aged knight and his wife
were arrested forthwith.
A few days after their imprisonment
a confession was wrung from the man
while his wife acknowledged her com
plicity. On March 10, 1894, judgment
was passed. The culprits were con
demned to loss of nobility and to life
imprisonment. The clemency of Em
peror Franz Josef prevented the lat
ter part of the sentence by commuting
it to eight years' imprisonment for Boor
and two years for his wife.
As the jailer was taking his prisoner
to his future home Yon Boor heard a
shrill cry of agony. He turned and he
saw his wife pass him robed In the con
vict garb. That heart-broken cry was
the last sound the nobleman ever heard
of the outside world. On December 2
of this year death commuted his term.
It is surmised that this genius coun
terfeited notes to the amount of nine
or ten millions of gulden, although he
confessed to a much smaller amount.
Only his last issues were discovered,
for his first work was so perfect as to
be undistinguishable from the genuine.
For the criminologist this talented
nobleman is a subject almost without
a peer. Charitable he was and honest
in everything but the one that caused
his downfall.
TRIAL OF A
GYPSY EMPEROR
The Assize Court of Coepenich. a
suburb of Berlin, has just had before it
a somewhat original case in which two
bands of gypsies were concerned.
Some time ago these two bands were
encamped at Neu-Weisensee. At the
head of one was a chief named Trutt
mann. The other owed obedience to a
leader named Wotasch, who assumed
the title of "Emperor of the Gypsies."
As a sign of his rank he always wore
a silver sword.
His daughter, Margaret Wotasch. a
celebrated Romany beauty, fell in love
with the son of Truttmann. The fath
ers of the happy pair were not averse
to the match. Wotasch, however, was
not blind to the weaknesses of his fu
ture son-in-law, and entered into a
contract with the latter's father, in
which it was laid down that if Trutt
mann Jr. should s\yindle or rob him, he
would be entitled to take his daughter
back and receive an indemnity for the
costs of the marriage.
In this the Gypsy Emperor proved his
wisdom. Three weeks after the mar
riage his ungrateful son-in-law relieved
him of six horses, which he sold at the
nearest horse fair, and followed up this
crime by further indelicacies of a like
nature. Wotasch called together a
gypsy court, which met in the forest
near Weissensee, and debated the af
fair. After much discussion the err
ing son-in-law was ordered to restore
his wife to his indignant father-in-law
and to pay the expenses of the mar
riage. As these amounted to 3600
marks, it is clear the Gyr>sy Emperor
did things in fine style. The festivities.
it was stated, had lasted a full week,
and were conducted on a scale of lavish
hospitality.
In how far the decision of the gypsy
tribunal was given impartially is the
question that has occupied the more
regular tribunals of the German Em
peror. The husband pretends that the
silver saber of his father-in-law, aided
by the sturdy fists of his followers, had
had an unfortunate effect on the sense
of justice of the gypsy judges. One
thing is certain, and that is that the
followers of both chiefs since the ludg
ment was given have been on a war
footing.
The "Emperor" Wotasch and his
War Minister appeared before the
court in gorgeous costume, with golden
spurs and an abundance of lace em
broidery on their garments. Wotasch
was put upon oath, and raised his right
hand to swear when by some accident,
as he averred, it came in violent con
tact with the head of his enemy. who
promptly measured his length on the
floor of the court.
Fortunately for him this last exploit
was the only one that could be proved
against him, and he and his "Minister
of War" escaped with a small fine. â

frain from bloodshed in times of great
provocation that I would base the right
of my countrymen to citizenship. I
claim that we have shown for genera
tions â ever since the Spanish occupa
tion, and even long before â the capa
city, to govern ourselves, for the most
of the gobernadocillos or governors of
townships, and n.any of the provincial
governors, have been native Filipinos.
As the township, under an American
regime, would also be the unit of gov
ernment, it follows that the same ad
ministrative talents that have made the
Filipino communities models of domes
tic peace hitherto will keep them the
same.
Aguinaldn, though young for such a
position, has surely shown remarkable
ability, and would, I believe, always
handle himself with discretion. Agon
cillo is another man who has shown an
uncommon talent for affairs â while
Cayetano S. Arellano, the eminent Ma
nila Jurist, is in my mind as capable as
any American whom it has yet been my
fortune to meet. This man is a pro
found lawyer, and is of untarnished
reputation. He is widely traveled and
conversant with the history of other
countries as well as with every detail
of the life of his own. He should be
put at the head of the Supreme Court
of the islands, if the United States de
cide to assume the task of governing
them, for no other man so well knows
the intricate Spanish laws, the customs
and the character of the people.
I have merely made mention of these
names to prove that a few of us at
least are ready for even the duties of
American citizenship â high as these are
âand I do not underrate them when I
say this. Indeed, we can show not a
few others who would rank on the same
intellectual plane with the gentlemen
mentioned aboveâ and there is no rea
son why, in the course of a genera
tion, there should not be thousands
where now there are srorpp. It will
cause some surprise when I state that
no subject possesses greater interest to
the Filipino mind than civics and law.
There are to-day already more than
1000 Filipinos who are full-fledged law
yers â graduates of the University of
Manila, and some of them of the best
schools in Europe. The average native
also is much interested in the affairs
of his village, and there is usually as

It might be thought that such a

it is ;iil bosh, and that the only bene
fit derived is from the neat and a little
]>s\ chic effect.
The advocates of the treatment point
to numerous "cures" and als<> the indis
putable fact that those who subject
themselves to the baths are sure to
lose in weight. The treatment is said
to be absolutely harmless, no matter
â¢â¢\h..t the patient's condition.
Be all this as it may, there is no
denying the fact that a man feels dif
ferent after an electric light bath than
he ever felt before In his life. The dry
heat that permeates the body is not
possible and practicable by any other
means. Water heated to the same tem
perature as the interior ol the cabinet
is while ,i patient is being treated would
instantly scald off all the skin, it is
only reasonable to suppose that such
an atmosphere must have a strong ab-
BOrbative quality and should draw
some, if not all. impurities out of the
body.
"It won't hurt you at ail," said the
physician in charge of one of these elec
tric light baths, "and it may do you a
great deal of good. If there is any
diseased part In your body it will be
located in a very few moments after
you get into the cabinet. That spot
will feel a little warmer than the rest
of you l- body."
The apparatus in front of me looked a
good deal like one of the old fashioned
wardrobes that stood in our grand
mother's room. There was a good deal
of carved, polished woodwork, a good
deal of glass and a little brass finish.
"How do I get it?" I asked.
"I'll show you," answered the doc
tor. '"Just tbtoe off your clothes and
put on this thin linen gown."'
I did as requested. The doctor then
opened one side of the cabinet and
pointed to a chair on the Inside.
Whan I was seated he put * screen
with a hole In it, to let my head go
through, over my shoulder?. This
touphed all four sides of the cabinet and
was in reality a sort of diaphragm, in
tended to separate two different tem
peratures.
I'm to this moment the cabinet was
almost in darkness and felt a little cold.
When the doctor closed the door and I
heard the lock "click" it felt colder

The better the prisoner behaves the
better is he treated and the sooner he

Exercise is also an indulgence to be

and I began to wonder how 1 could get
out.
But at that/moment there was a sud
den glare all around me. It was so
bright and startling it seemed to me for
an instant that there had been an ex
plosion. I soon recovered from this ef
fect and looked about me. There were
hundreds of electric lights fixed U> the
walls of the cabinet and just in front
â¢if me was a mirror bo arranged that it
reflected them all over again.
After a moment they all began to
swim around and I felt a dizzy feeling
creep over me. Then T began to get
warm, and it was such a delightful
warmth. Not the moist, clammy heat
of a summer day. but just the warmth
of the electric light bath. There is
nothing like ii. It permeated every part
of my body. My hands were warm and
dry. but I felt no impression when I
put them onto the iron arm of the chair.
A perfect equilibrium was established.
I. felt as if I could stay in the cabi
net forever. I seemed to be swaying
back and forth. The electric lights got
brighter and brighter and I was per
fectly happy.
Then the lights went out and the
doctor opened the door. I stemi^d out,
and, strange to say. felt no sensation
of co'<i. This was, of course, due to the
fact that my skin was perfectly dry.
Then T put on my -clothes and went
out feeling as if I were walking. on air.

Millionaire Astor Explains
About His Famous Redwood
WILLIAM WALDORF AS
TOR is going about London
with fire in his eye.
All of his attorneys have
been called in consultation, and he has
decided to make an example of a news
paper, some newspaper, any old news
paper.
And it Is all on account of a piece of
our California redwood tree.
How could a piece of California red
wood make a member of the aristo
cratic house of Actor mad? Ah, that's
it. And thereby hangs a tale.
Mr. Astor Is not at all particular as to
which paper he makes an example of,
but the tn Ã¼ble is that he will have to
decide before his attorneys can get to
work. And then it will be shifted oft

WHAT FOREIGN MISSIONS ARE DOING
ACCORDIG TO PRESIDENT MOON
3r~a-vHE Gospel "is the power of C,<Â«\ '
3 unto salvation to every one that
3 believeth." To the church the
3 J_ Savior said, "Go ye into all the :
3 world, and preach the Gospel to i
â¢every creature." "And 10, I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the
world." The promise of his presence is
on condition that his people engage in
the work of carrying nut the commis- ;
sion.
So long as more than half the people
of the world have never heard the i
Gospel, the church cannot be excused
! for inactivity. Nor can it expect to re- '
tain the presence of Christ and spiritual
power while it goes on in neglect of the
commission conferred on it by the head
Of the church. Never before in the his
tory of the world were conditions so
favorable to the preaching of the Gos
pel to every creature as now. Turn al
most where you will â to continent, na- |
tion or island â the gates are open, and \
the truth may be given to the millions !
of earth's inhabitants. It is little won- j
der that the church is shorn of its
power, when under these circumstances
nine-tenths of all the contributions for
foreign missions are given by one-tenth
of the church membership, and, fur- .
ther, the members of the evangelical
churches in the I'nited States contrib
ute for the conversion of a thousand
million heathens less than one penny
a week each, and 98 per cent of all the
contributions of the church for relig- I
ious purposes is spent at home, and j
only 2 per cent is devoted to the foreign ;
mission field.
It is estimated that if evangelical ;
church members would devote a tithe \
of their increase of wealth to the work
of foreign missions it would amount to
the sum of $4,347,900 annually, whereas I
the contributions to foreign work I
amount to less than one-thirty-second !
of one per cent on the valuation of the !
property held by them at the present i
time.
There is no lack of means in the i
hands of the church. If this was con
secrated, the Gospel could be given to
the heathen quickly; but if held, even
to be devoted to the home field, on j
which so much labor has been be
stowed; the church certainly can not !
expect God's approval.
It is evident from such Scriptures as j
Revelation, xiv:6, and Matthew, xxiv:l4, j
that the heathens are to have the j
Gospel. The Lord has waited for the â 
church to use the means he has placed j
within its reach, and it has not as yet
accepted the blessing in store for the
faithful. Will he continue to wait tat
me and for you? or will he find other I
agencies and means to accomplish his i
work? It will be done.

Belgium's Gas Bill
The Bolgians are a frugal race. If
you doubt it hero is the proof.
A few days ago the Government re
solved to introduce a uniform standard
of time. In the western part of the
country the clocks were put back twen
ty minutes to conform with the facts.
Every Belgian peasant goes to bed at
9 p. m., if not sooner. Under the new
time style he went to bed at 9 p. m. by
the clock, which was really 9:20 p. m..
old style. Consequently he sat ud
twenty minutes later than before and
got up twenty minutes earlier â that is.
by actual sun time.
But sitting up twenty minutes later
involved a larger consumption of gas
and the nation's gas bill increased
$1,000,000 annually, to the great delieht
lof the gas companies, which had se
cretly lobbied for the new time stand
ard. The peasant soon found but that
I the time standard raised his gas bill.
He could not change his hour of going
to bed, because that was a family
habit that had been in force for gener
ations, so he began to agitate for the
repeal of the new system.
It was BhoWn during the campaign
that the new plan cost $1,000,000 in gas
annually and had no sense or meaning
in it whatever. There was never any
doubt as to its fate after the frugal
peasant went on the warpath for Its
scalp, and it has been repealed.Special to The Sunday Call.

MILLIONS OF
TREASURE
NEAR
CUBA
My researches have been limited to
Fuch ancient Spanish records as may
be found in America, and from these
alone â and their number compares with
the immense libraries of such works in
Madrid as a drop to a stream â I have
unearthed the stories of more than a
"f vessels and fleets, the wrecks
of which now lie in American waters.
Fleet of Treasure Wrecks.
Bast of the Isle of Pines are the
Gardinillos, or famous Jardine rocks,
where lies a whole fleet of good ships.
It was here that the daring buccaneer
captain, liarthelome Portugues, lost
th.- richest prize he ever took in his
adventurous career, and it lies there
to-day, awaiting the lucky submarine
explorer. The account of the wreck
in the old books is most circumstantial.
Harthelome Portugues had fitted out
a small three-pounder vessel at Golfo
Triste, on the Gulf of Campeachy, and
with a crew of thirty men he had cap
tured a treasure galleon bound from
Carthagena to Havana. It was a lucky
adventure. The inventory of the ship's
goods showed over a hundred thousand
dollars' worth of gold and silver bul
lion, with as much more in coin. Por
tugues set his sails for Tortuga. but as
they were passing Cape Corrientos
three swift sailing guard vessels from
New Pnain swept down upon the ship
and captured him and the entire crew,
and took them in irons to San Fran
cisco in Campeachy. The old account
tells how Portugues escaped that night,
and after an almost incredible journ> y
through the swamps, secured a canoe
from a friend, enlisted thirty men and
actually recovered the ship that had
been taken from him. Then he sailed
away again for Tortuga, that island of
blood and spoil.
Off the Isle of Pines a hurricane
brought down vengeance upon him and
carried him irresistibly on the Jardine
rocks, and the galleon with all its
treasure went down. Some of the
hardy buccaneers escaped in a small
boat to tell the story, but the gold and
silver bullion for which they risked so
much is still heaped in some hollow .if
that rock-bound bed of the sea. This
treasure would pay richly for the re
covery-
Fifteen Tons of Silver Bars.
Another account of sunken treasure
is tcld as a musty joke in a musty
tome. In 1650 three canoes, manned by
fifteen buccaneers, each crept around
the western end of Cuba and came sud
denly upon one of his Majesty's treas
ure ships, bound from Caracas t<> Ha
vana. They swarmed over the side of
the great vessel like so many rats, and
threw every Spaniard overboard. The
uncouth victors ransacked the vessel
for booty, but to their disgust, found
only a small quantity of wine in th^
officers' quarters, and in the hold a
all of its fifty-seven feet of flagstaff to
bring its highest point within three feet
of the top of the pyramid. Omitting the
pyramid, however, it is conspicuously
the tallest inhabited building in the
world, for, while the cornice of the
American Surety building is ?,Yi feet
above the level of the street, the Boor
of the restaurant at the top of the Park
Row building will be 308 feet above the
; . while the floor of the topmost
offices in the towers (fine, well-lighted
rooms twenty-four feet in diameter)
will be 340 feet above the same level.
The main part of the building will have
twenty-five stories, while the Park row
front will be twenty-seven stories high,
the space between the two towers being
occupied by a kitchen for use in con
nection with a restaurant below it,
which will occupy the full width of the
building. The cornice of this front is

i top of the cupola on the towers is 390
I feet above the same level. The flag pole
truck is fifty-seven feet above the
cupola, while the feet of the piles are
fifty-four feet below the street level;
hence the total height of the building
! from shoe of piling to truck of Hag pole
I is over 500 feet.
Although tli building admits of com-
I parison in respect of height with the
j pyramid when we come to the question
of volume and weight our nineteenth
century effort sinks into positive insig
nificance. The pyramid, in its present
mutilated condition, has a base n
about 450 feet. Its present volume is
estimated at about 82,000,000 cubic feet,
and its weight at 6,316,000 tons. The
Park Row building has a volume of
' 3,906,580 cubic feet and a total dead
i weight of 20,000 tons, so that the ancient

the wealthiest in New England by
sharing the secret of a smuggler, who
saw a plate fleet go down in a storm,
about half way between the nearest
points of Cuba and Hayti. "Phipps' for
tune" has been famous ever since. And
yet it is said that he found only one of
the sunken Bhlps of the fleet containing
not less than thirty-two tons of silver,
with jewels enough to make $2,000,000.
The remainder of the vessels still lie off
the eastern point' of Cuba, and they are

the volume and over 300 times the

Evidently, in respeci of the bulk and
wight of our buildings we cannot i"in
pete with the ancients, and as the
pyramid is no longer a popular form
df mausoleum, it is not likely that we
shall ever attempt to.
it is a curious fact, which will come
as a surprise to many of "ur readers,
that, for all its great size and mass,
this building is no heavier than the
latest ocean liner the Kaiser Wllhelm
dpr CJrosse. The building contains about
8000 tons of steel and 12,000 tons of other
material, chiefly brick and terra cotta.
making a total weight for the building
Of 20,000 tons. The Kaiser Wllholm
displaces 20,000 tons of water, and
therefore equals the towering "sky
scraper" in weighi. The extreme length
estimated to contain many millions of
dollars.
Millions in Bullion.
Another treasure wreck is the center
of. a most romantic and thrilling story
of crime. In the year 1717 Charles
Vane, a notorious pirate of the West
Indies, captured about $80,000 in pieces
of eight that were being taken by div
ers from one of five plate ships that had
gone down in a storm just east of Key
W'.-st. The silver bars, as they were
' of the liner is 649 feet, measured on
deck, so ihat she exceeds the greatest
dimensions of the building' by 14S feet.
The total cost of the building was $2,
--400,000. and that of the ship probably
$1,000,000, or even $1,500,000 more, the
greater coat of the ship being: due
chiefly to the greater power and weight
of machinery, of which about 27,000
horsepower is in the ship, as against
1000 horsepower in the building;. Brick
and terra cotta, moreover, are cheaper
materials than ship frames and plating.
This extraordinary building, with its
modest frontage of 104 feet on Park
row and of 20 feet and 4S feet on a side
street and an alley, will accommodate
the floating population of a fair-sized
country town. That this is no exag
geration the following figures will show.
There are in the whole building 950
separate offices. As most of these are
brought to the surface by divers, were
stored in a little fort on the mainland
to await the Guardacosta, which was
carrying: the treasure in installments to
Havana. Vane learned of this and made
a sudden descent upon the fort, cap
tured the treasure, rowed out to the
vessel where the divers were at work,
captured the ship and sailed away,
leaving the destitute crew and divers
marooned on the barren key. The plate
fleet of flvil galleons, on which these
divers were working:, was carrying $4.
--000,000 in bullion when it was wrecked,
and less than a fourth was recovered
and captured by Vane. The old rec
ords estimate that $3,000,000 still re
mains in the sea at this point.
Treasure Galleons.
Another circumstantial but incom
plete report tells of the wreck of sev
eral treasure galleons in the Gulf of
Florida in 1676. Of this treasure eight
million dollars in pieces of eight were
recovered and carried to Havana. Fifty
thousand more after being stored on
the shore were captured by the famous
Captain Jennings, who had hastily
equipped three sloops in Jamaica. After
this assault the Spaniards abandoned
all further work on the sunken gal
leons and lost all knowledge of their
exact location. There is no question
that a little exploration here will re
veal this sunken fleet, which still con
tains, according to the old records, sev
eral million dollars in gold and silver.
Another Rich Wreck
Somewhere a few miles southwest of
the Isle of Pines there is a princely
fortune in diamonds and gold await
ing the hunter who will travel the bot
tom of the Caribbean Sea and cast a
searchlight carefully over the hulls of
sunken treasure ships. It is the re
mains of a Spanish ship in the royal
service, whose commander, Don Sebas
tian Jeminez, touched at Santiago de
Cuba in 1560, on his way to Spain. He
was carrying the "king's fifth" from
the silver mines of Guanacaboa,
amounting to nearly twelve tons of
good silver bars and unknown but im
mense quantities of personal treasure
shipped by homegoing merchants.
Upon sailing from Santiago he was
caught in a terrific tempest which tore
the ship from its anchor and drove it
upon the rocks within sight of the ob
servers on the bluffs at Santiago. No
vestige of ship or crew was ever seen
again. The galleon probably lies not
far from the recent naval battle
ground between the Spanish and
American fleets, and it offers a princely
lure for the bold submariner who will
conduct a patient search.
Richest Treasure Ship.
Another, and probably the richest of
all treasure ships lost in the West In
dies, was wrecked in 1679. A notable
of generous proportions, a fair estimate
of their capacity would be an average
of four people to each office. Now, it is
reasonable to assume that there will be
at any given hour <>f the day an aver-
I age of one visitor in tba buildine mi
business for each person employed. This
would m;ikt> ;i total number â >! perÃOns
in the building at any period of the day
8000. If we assume that on an average
five persons would call at each ofhVe
during the day for each person em
ployed we get a total of about 25,000
souls making use of the building in the
course of every working day of the
year.
While the home of The Call is not so
high as the new Park Row structure
it has many points 'about its construc
tion that make it the most unique
building in the world. The top of the
dome rises to a height of 315 feet and
company of officials, ecclesiastics and
citizens of New Spain were on board,
bound for Spain, at the invitation of
the King. They carried the most costly
personal possessions. The record tells
of diamond crosses of enormous value
and presents that were to win the fa
vor of the great King of Spain, besides
many tons of silver bullion, which was
actually used as ballast. But many
times richer than all these were the
bars of gold which most of the officials
were carrying with them back to
Spain, in the hopes of living the rest
of their days in distinguished opulence.
One of the ladies, Dona Inez Escobedo,
was taking with her an Indian slave
as a present for her brother, who was
governor of one of the Canary Islands.
The few negro slaves on board were
servile enough, but the Indian, whose
name the records do not give, was un
manageable and grew more obstinate
at every punishment.
One morning, when the ship was a
few leagues southeast of the Isle of
Pines, the captain was horrified to find
that water was pouring into the hold.
He was about to descend through the
hatchway to discover the cause, when
the warning voice of the Indian de
clared that the first man to appear
through the opening would be shot.
Immediately thowe who gathered about
heard the blows of a hatchet upon the
bottom of the vessel. The horrible
truth then dawned upon them that the
untamable Indian intended to escape
slavery by wrecking the ship with ail
on board. They threw down a negro
slave, believing that his body would re
ceive the fire of the Indian, but every
thing above the hatches was plainly
visible from the darkness below and
the negro lay where he fell, stupefied
with fear, while the blows of the
hatchet rained faster than ever, and
the roar of the water constantly in
creased in volume. At last an old of
ficer, Jose Nunez, sprang suddenly
through the opening into the hold,
waist-deep in water, and charged upon
the Indian, sword in hand. He was
followed by half a dozen others. They
splashed around and finally found the
Indian under a beam, beneath the
water, where he had crawled and
drowned himself. The most frantic ef
forts were made to stop the leak, but
the ship sank, and it was with diffi
culty that even one boatload of the
passengers was able to escape.
Numerous attempts were made by the
Spaniards to recover the treasure from
this ship, but divers never could find it.
These are only a few of many score
of similar wrecks, the records of which
can be found in the old Spanish re
ports and histories. They will indicate,
in some measure the enormous rich
ness of these hitherto undescribed re
sources of our new possessions.

THE MYSTERY OF TOKIO
CHAPTER I. -â /. X-
-IT was about 4 o'clock of a wintry afternoon that a well-dressed, mid
dle-aged gentleman entered the Sujlyama Bank in Tokio. wallet in
hand, and taking therefrom a certified check presented it to the cash
ier. The cashier examined the note and nodded, and then proceeded
to count out sixty thousand dollars in paper and other money of vari
ous denominations, which the gentleman tallied and then somewhat
carelpssly placed in his wallet and left the building. Entering a rikisha
â¢ which was evidently waiting for him at the door, he said to the driver,
"Carry me back; quick!" Whereupon the man started on a run with the
vehicle homeward bound. The whole proceedings had been narrowly
watched by a man of slim though graceful build and pale complexion,
whose business about the bank seemed to be unknown, but who continued
to keep an eye upon the rikisha till it disappeared in the distance. Then
this personage also took his departure at a brisk pace and with a preoc
cupied airâ indeed, his every action was indicative of deep meditation.
The rikisha man made straight for the Shiba Hotel, and on his arrival
there called out mechanically, "The gentleman has returned," at the-same
. time slowly holding the rikisha downward, so as to permit of the easier
egress of his fare, who left the vehicle with the wallet and its precious
I contents. The gentleman in question was Mr. Hara, manager of the Kobe
â  Trading Company, who had agreed to purchase a stock of merchandise
from the Yokohama Trading Company to the value of fifty-five thousand
dollars, the transaction to be completed at 7 o'clock that Eveningâ hence
hie hurry. Shortly after his arrival one of the hotel waitresses handed
Mr. Hara a telegram, which had been delivered during his absence, and
which read: "Come at 12 to-morrow. Merchandise iiui completely ar
ranged this evening."
"How vexatious this Is!' exclaimed Mr. Hara as s.->on as he had read
the patch, at the same time eying the wallet with an expression of
annoyance, as much as to say: "Now I am. under the neceasil of stand
ing guard over this money all night."
\ . "What do you wish to order for supper this evening?" asked the maid.
â¢ Mr. Hara gave hi* order and was going to add, "I do not care for" any
sake to-night." had the words not been arrested on his lips by the en
â¢ ticing odor of the fragrant beverage, supplemented by the clinking of
glasses and the interchange of toasts in the adjoining apartments; all of
which had the effect of Emulating his appetite for a liquor he was very
partial to. and so it ended by his ordering sake in answer to the encour
aging prnilp of the waitress.
Now the effect of a bumper of sake is to induce carelessness on the
part of the imbiber thereof, and when this bumper is repeated the care
lessness becomes all the more pronounced, until all precautl even to
the care of money, re forgotten. And so it came to pass that the normal
â¢wlntr aspect of Mr. Hara gave place to the roseate hue <>f spring and he
presently found himself taikir.g airy nothings even to a servant maid, till
â¢â¢at last he crept into bori in a state >if utter helplessness. *
A tower clock on Giuza street strikes 12, deepening the night of night.
" All nature Is buried In repose. Winter itself adds to the solitude. A sus
picious figure, costumed in black from head to foot, only relieved by an
â¢-evil glitter of the eyo. pauses it the door of the apartment wherein -Mr.
. â¢Hara s presence is only betokened by his stertorous breathing. Slowly
nf! cautiously, inch by inch, the figure op.-ns the door of the apartment
and advances to the center of the floor. Further still the dying lamp is
lowered. Then the black figure approaches the bed on which* the sleeping
merchant is lying. There nre moistened papers in its left hand, a knife
in its right. The critical moment has arrived. No sooner have the moist
ened papers been placed ipon the face than the glittering knife is pene
trating the body of the sleeper. The papers on the face prevent any out
cry on the part of the dying man. the only thing betraying his agony
being the noiseless motion of tht feet and hands beneath the coverlet. At
leneth under the cruel thrusts of the knife the last gasp is heard Mr
Hara lies dead.
The black figure, after finishing Its butchery, looked cautiously over
its garments, as if to ascertain whether there are any blood stains there;
then took from its clothing s. long string, which it attached irely to
the wallet, the latter having been found beneath the pillow. With a "sat
isned smile, but still with a stealthy movement, the figure approacl the
window, which it opened just sufficiently wide to pass the wallet through
"Mew: mew!" was the sound which then issued from the black figure
which signal was promptly responded to by the barking of a dog upon the
ground below. At the same time the wallet was lowered from th*' win
dow by means of the string and w.-.s caught by a well-dressed Individual
who had evidently been waiting for It. At this instant a chill blast of
northern wind extinguished the light in the chamber, the black figure dis
appearedâsuch was the message from the night, fitting climax to this
barbaric tragedy!
CHAPTER 11.
A well-dressed individual, carrying a wallet, was making his way about
midnight along the Dobashl ditch, when he suddenly heard the" words
"Wait a minute." uttered by somebody behind.
"I don't mean to Interfere with your business." went on the voice
'but as I happen to be in depressed circumstances lust at present T
thought I would ask you to let me have some little share of what you've
got."
"Who in the world are you?" replied the person addressed, turning
with an air of extreme vexation. "Ohâ Yone! What are you doing hero
at such an hour as this? You seem to be hard upâ well, if that's the case
I'll let you have five dollars."
Yone took the money and immediately threw it on the ground
"What nonsense Is this? " he said In a louder key. "I know all about
the business, as the victim was one of a thousand. I've been all tne after
noon trying hard to snatch the stuff. I think in common fairness I should
have at least one-third of the pot."
"I never knew you were in the secret as deep as all that." replied the
other. "All right, Yone. you shall have it."
So saying he opened the wallet and began fumbling with the money
while Yone came up still closer to inspect the operation. A momentafy
flash lit up the darkness. Then the words. "Oh! you contemptible -
coward to use pistol."
Presently a man came running up to the epot. evidently attracted by
the flash, as no sound had accompanied It. He found nothing but a bleed
. ing body lying on the ground.
"What! Is it you, Yone?" asked the newcomer. "Who shot you? You
â  know who I amâ Detective Kato."
V ' "Oh. yes. I know you. Mr. Kato," replied the figure on the ground

â â¢. '.."Hush! Keep quiet! We are officers. We <=imply cried "telegram" to

HOW TO SUCCEED AS AN ARTIST
.William M. Chase, the Famous New York Painter, Recounts His Early
Struggles to Win Fame and his Final Triumph,
From Fifteenth street, facing Livingston place, there is one of the
prettiest views in all New York. To the north are the red brick build
ings of the Religious Society of Friends, and beyond the old stone
Church of St. George. In an imposing old style house commanding this
view lives the famous artist, William M. Chase, and in his drawing
room I talked with him the other day regarding his carry struggles and
his first successful venture.
The walls of the parlors are hung with many of the paintings which
made Mr. Chase's working rooms in the old Studio building, on Tenth
â . the show place of New York for nearly twenty years There is
the portrait of Carroll Beckwith, the Lady in White, and beautitful Mrs.
Chaae watching her children at play in the broad hall of the summer
house in the Shinneeook hills.
Special to The Sunday Call.
WHATEVER success I may
have attained, said Mr.
rhape, comes from my love
of art for art's sake only. I
always wanted to be an ar
tist, and 1 came to be one this way:
My father owned a general store in
amsburff, Ind. .You know what a
general store is. He kept everything
ar.d sold to farmers and village peo
ple.
When I wag about sixteen he went
â up to Indianapolis and started the
largest shoe store in that city. One
part of it was separated from the
rest and devoted to ladies. It was
. carpeted. It was the first ladies' shoe
â tore in the West. One day my father
'came to me and said: 'William, you
have spoiled wrapping paper enough
here. Put on your hat and come with
me. I'm going to take you up to
' Hays."
On our way to the artist's rooms he
explained to me regretfully how sorry
he felt that his endeavors to make a
..business man of me had failed; that he
hadn't much hope or faith in my art
â  predilections, but was willing to give
'me a chance, and he thought that a
studio was a better place for that
rhance than a shoe store, and thus I
began my studies with B. F. Hays, the
artist, in his studio next to the old
Postofflce.
Mr. Hays set me to work copying
things which were of no earthly ad
vantage to me as an art student. For
instance he had me copy in oil a
steel engraving of one of Rosa Bon
heur's pictures. After I had been with
him for a year or so, however, he did
do me a genuine service. He advised
my father to send me to New York.
I came to this city with several let
ters of introduction to wholesale shoe
dealers, who were requested to keep
a kindly watch over me, and another
letter to the late J. O. Eaton, a West
ern artist, who had attained consid
erable reputation in the metropolis
I went into Mr. Eaton's studio and
upon his advice I entered the National
Academy of Design. When I was 20
years old my father failed in business.
He might have taken advantage of the
bankruptcy law and saved a respecta
ble fortune. But it was an honest fail
ure. He regretted very much that he
could not continue supporting me and
he wondered what use I could make of
my art training. I didn't know exactly
what to do.
I gave the matter considerable
thought. I had had one year's ex
perience In the shoe business, and I
had learned how to sell a lady a pair
of shoes two sizes too small for her.
I was very successful in that, and I
had made up my mind that if it came
to the worst I would go into a shoe
store as a clerk. But fortunately I
didn't have to. I laid the matter be
fore Mr. Eaton, and he advised me to
paint flowers and fruits, in which line
of work I had been moderately suc
cessful. Through his influence 1 was
able to sell some of these. There are
a number of them now up around

vehicle came abreast of the Shiba Hotel the young man suddenly called
out to the rikisha man to stop, as he wanted to go to the toilet. Sd saying
he got down, leaving the bamboo hamper in the rikisha.
The man waited more than half an hour, when he began to gr<hw sus
picious and made n thorough search (if the toilet apartment, but found
nobody there. As, however, baggage had been left in the rikisha. it was
the duty of the man to leave a at the police station, which was <"lose at
hand. The appearance of the bamboo hamper, which was very Securely
tied, excited the curiosity of the officers at the station, who thereupon
called up Detective Kato, and while the rikisha man held the liltht the
bumper was untied. What it contained excited the wonder and amaze
ment of allâ the head, feet and hands of a man. who had evidentjy been
thus barbarously murdered and dismembered less than twenty-four hours
before. â¢
Detective Kato. to the astonishment of the bystanders, exclaimed:
"Why, this is; Goto!â 'Noblp.' as we call htm." and tnen to the still
farther surprise and bewilderment of the officers and the rikisha man he
turned to the latter and said:
"Did the young: fellow who rode in your rikisha look or act at all like
a woman?"
The officers, in short, had not the least conception of what he meant.
Surely, they thought, this detective is a strange and mysterious charac
ter. "While endeavoring â â  obtain some clew to the murder at the Shiba
Hotel he smelt th> papers that bad been placed upon the. dead man's face;
now he asks n' th. young man who rode in the rikisha did not look or act

for as a probable agent in the hotel murder, dead himself. Nine out of ten

o'clock," he muttered, "and neither of them here. Strange
. ... ah! here she comes."
The rustle of a woman's dress was heard and presently a female figure
drew near to the place where Detective Kato was concealed. Two minutes
after a young and stylishly dressed man approached from the opposite
direction and loined the female.
"Ah, Ichita, my love, at last. How ungallant of you to keep me wait
ing!" was the salute of the latter as the man approached and embraced
her.
"Better late than never." rejoined her lover gayly. "Now let us sit
down here on the jrrass and tell me what it is you want to see me about "
The couple seated themselves at some little distance from where thÂ»Â»
detective lay hidden, and as he could get no nearer without bring discov
he had to listen with all attention to enable him to make out their
language. The conversation at first proceeded in whispers, which it was
-ible for him to understand. At length the tones became more ani
mated.
"Why are you such a coward?" said the female. "You need never fear
his reappearance. Have I not assured you he is dead? Henceforth my
love, you shall be master in the house."
"But how. when and where?" responded the other dubiously. "I have
of the funeral ceremony. Tell me. when did it take place?"
"Don't ask such nonsensical questions." returned the female voice
"It is enough to knOw that he will never trouble us ns:ain. He Is now en
during the torments of hell, as h!= career demanded "
"But tell me. love, the particulars. I wish to be satisfied beyond a
doubt." Insisted the man in a coaxing tone.
"Well, come closer; the night is getting cold. Thereâ now listen and
I'll tell you nil."
Here, to the disappointment of Detective Kato. the voices of the pair
sank so low as to be almost inaudible, only some disjointed expressions
such as "Gito . . . Noble . . . stabbed .... corpse .
happy." Berving to pive him an inkling as to the gist of the conversation
had. however, heard enough to convince him that he was
on th>' right track of the perpetrators of the series of murders that had
hitherto baffi tllce. It now remained for him to Identify the woman
him with the infstress of the mysterious house be had visited dur

and this comparison he proposed immediately to make.
CHAPTER V.
On the following morning a stylishly dressed young man. riding in a
rikisha, was arrested by the police about a hundred yards distant from
of mystery" find taken to the station. He" was known to the
;>le generally as a second-rate actor Ichita by
name, playing at the Azabusa Theater. About 10 o'clock the same even
shabbily <'r<<s(>l Individual called at the "house of mystery" and
asked to see the mistress, saying that he had an Important message to
deliver, accompanied] by a letter from an actor at the Azabuza Theater;
and aa It was for her ears alone he wished to see her in private. These
were conveyed to the mistress of the house and caused her such
a feeling of uneasiness as to Induce her to grant the messenger an inter
view, even at such an unseasonable hour. Accordingly she invited him
into h private apartment, where she opened and read the following letter:
"I hast, n to inform you that a sudden emergency compels me to leave
'he city immediately. The bearer of this letter is' a friend of mine in
whom you can place implicit reliance and who knows all the circumstances
of the case. Accordingly do not be afraid to converse with him freely and
also send me ritty dollars by his hand. Your most devoted lover,

sake and was soon convening familiarly and confidentially with 'her guesi
Goblet followed goblet, and In the freedom which ensued she made many
allusions to circumstances connected wilh the tragedies which had re
cently startled the community, apparently under the impression that she
waÃ conversing with one who could be trusted. At length the strange vis
itor prepared to take his leave, and with profuse allusions to the hospi
tality of his hostess, made for the door with as much dignity as his ap
parent intoxication would let him.
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Fugii. for the fifty dollars " said he as
he balanced in his hand the purse the lady had given him. "I will give It
to Ichita as soon as I see him. He is waiting for me now, so I must keeD
the appointment." H
"Your hand is not very steady." replied the lady. "Take good care of
It. and tell him to return as soon as he can."
"Never fear." returned the visitor, though the unsteadiness of his walk
as he left the house belied his assurances.
By the time he reached the road he was staggering still worse and
went along singing snatches of comic songs in a maudlin voice Suddenly
somebody tapped him cm the shoulder.
"Why. it is you. Mr. Kato!" said a figure in the gloom "Well I
shouldn't have known you if I hadn't been looking for you about this
nlace and time."
"Yes. yes." returned the detective, for it was he. "Evervthina Is ill

ever been in there are one or more
mon who feel a personal interest in art.
They are natural art patrons. I mot
two such men in St. Louis. One of them
was named Hodges and the other was
Samuel Dodd. They were both very
wealthy. One day I overheard them
talking in my studio about me.
"What do you think we had better
do?" said Mr. Hodges.
"Send him abroad," answered Mr.
Dodd.
"We'll get commissions for him to be
executed on the other side, and we will
have the money advanced to him for
his studies."
When this plan was laid before me I
very willingly gave up my studio and
went to Munich, where I entered the
academy of which the great Piloti was
the director. I took with me several
hundred dollars and I filled every com
mission according to promise. The
most expensive commission was for D.
A. Cole, one of the best known col
lectors in the West. He had advanced
$150. The picture I painted for him is
now in the Widener collection in Phila
delphia. If I had to do it over again
I would not do it for- ten times that
much.
After entering the academy I had a
pretty hard time of it. I foresaw- that
my money would be spent long before
I had acquired the requisite training,
and try as hard as I might I could not
sell my work to the local dealers. I
had been more or less of a revolution
ist in the school. I had objected to
painting pictures to order, and it was
not the way of the master.
At last I got down to bread and
cheese. Even my canvas and my paints
were supplied by my fellow students.
I had Seen in Munich two years and a
half. I had worked hard and conscien
tiously. I had been unable to sell any
thing. I had rerolved, it Is true, the
highest medal given by the academy

you can. I shall wait for you hereabouts."
The figure hurried off, while Detective Kato sauntered calmly on, all
traces of his assumed intoxication having disappeared.
"Well," he said to himself gravely, "it looks as though that woman
had got the best of me after all. That noiseless pistol 1 noticed in the
folds of her dressâ that was suspicious, to say the least. True. I had one
myself, but her position was always such as to make her mjstrcss of the
situation. I had no chance to use it. A remarkable woman, indeed, to
know I was a detective and yet to talk about her crimes and hand me
fifty dollars Into the bareafn. What? Ha!"
A momentary flash brightened the darkness, and as he uttered the
final ejaculation Detective Kato fell heavily to the ground. At the same
instant a dark-robed figure crept stealthily toward the recumbent body
through the gloom. CHApTER VL

in each class, but I had been severely
' criticized by the teachers for my inde
pendence, and the dealers would have
nothing to do with me. I know what
despair means.
! It was the turning point in my life.
: I don't know how much longer I could
< have kept up the struggle. I was for
; tunate in having secured quarters with
, some people who had confidence in me
1 âsufficient confidence to let me owe
them two years' rentâ but I could not
have held out very much longer, and
I knew it. It was then that I painted
;my first successful picture. It came
! about this way: I painted a study of
a woman in black, dressed in a riding
habit. It now hangs in the reception
; room of the Union League Club in this
; city. I sold it for $300. It was bought
by S. P. Avery. and now belongs to the
club. It was not the money that I got
from this picture, though, that brought
; me success, because I did not sell it
; until several months afterward. I took
' the canvas to Piloti and asked him
what he thought of it. He looked at it
i and then he said: "Mr. Chase. I want
you to paint the portraits of my chil
dren. I will advance you one-half of
the price before you begin work."
Within a day everybody in Munich
art circles know that the great painter
had commissioned me to paint the por
traits of his children. My reputation
j was made. The dealers who refused
to notice me crowded my studio and
asked for paintings, studies, anything
that I had. The seal of approval had
â¢ been set by the highest authority of
his day. I had money â Piloti's money
â and I was independent, so I told these
dealers "No," to go away, to let me
alone; that I would have nothing to
do with them. I paid my rent. T
walked on air. The whole world looked
bright. There was sunlight every
where.
I won't tell you how I painted these
portraits or what has become of them,
for that has nothing to do with the
matter we are talking about. A cu
rious sequel, however, to this little
siege of the Bavarian art dealers came
to pass only last month. Let me tell
you about it. One of the dealers had
In his store a portrait of a girl smok
ing a pipe, by Wilhelm Leibl. even at
that time a famous painter. I enjoyed
studying this picture more than al
most any other in Munich, and it oc
curred to me that so long as my work
was in demand I would exchange pome
of my pictures for it. so that I could
study it at my leisure in my own stu
dio. I gave three studies of heads in
exchange for it.
Now at the Stuart art sale last year
one of Leibl's pictures sold for $15,000.
About a month ago the art dealer who
arranged the trade in Munich more
than twenty years ago wrote to me,
asking whether I still had this picture,
and if so, whether I would sell it. I
I replied that I had it, and did not care
to dispose of it. In answer to this I
received a letter asking me to put my
own price upon the canvas. This was
a different matter. So I wrote to my
old time friends, telling them that if
they would send their agent to me with
$2000 I would part with the picture,
never thinking that my offer would be
accepted. But they cabled their ac
ceptance and they've gol the picture
now, and I don't know whether to be
sorry or glad.
How did Pilot) happen to ask me to
i paint his children's portraits? It was
I not wholly my study of the Woman in
Black, as I afterward learned, because,
although the great painter was a very
| harsh critic, he had a rather high idea
or my ability, which I possibly did not
i deserve. I'll give you an illustration.
I told you how I resented the methyl of
I manufacturing pictures employed in
j the academy, of my desire for inde
j pendence and all that. This happened
j a month or so before I received my
[ commission. I had all the sensitive
: independence that goes with unrecog
nized ability and grinding poverty. I
resented almost everything. That was
i my mood. One day the master said to
me that he wanted competitive com-
I positions from the pupils, and he had
j selected the subject of Columbus before
j the council because there were a num
: ber of Americans in the academy.
I Now, I knew how Piloti wanted those
I compositions to be made. I knew
I where he would place Columbus and
where he would put the members of the
council, but I determined that if I wei*e
compelled to paint it I would follow
i my own ideas.
Two days before the time for sub
mitting the compositions arrived, some
of my fellow-pupils asked me what 1
was doing with Columbus. I told them
nothing. "You'd better do something."
said one of them, "the chief expects
something very important from you."
I laughed. They insisted, and more as
aÂ» joke than anything else I laid out
nry composition. I said to one of the
young men, "There is no authorized
portrait of Columbus, is there?" No
one knew of any. "So," I continued,
"I'll paint the back of the discoverer,
and I won't put him in one corner of
the picture but in the center." And so
I did. I made him face the council in
a position that I knew would not en
tirely please the chief. The more I
worked on the thing the more interest
ed I became, and before I had been
painting an hour T was engrossed in it.
After I had finished it I laid it one
side and thought no more about it.
But I finally entered it with the other
compositions. To my intense surprise
it received the medal. As soon as the
award was announced Piloti came to
me. indignation written in every line
of his face.
"It's an outrage," he said. "I don't
and thenâ" Here she lowered her hand and made as if to fumble In
Kato's clothing. Suddenly a s;ream rent the stillness of the nignt-a
scream not from the supposed cead detective, but from the living woman.
As soon as the woman's hand was fairly beneath his robe Detective Kato,
who had merely been feigning -leath, grasped her wrist with a vl selike
grip. There was a short, sharp etruggle, during which the woman man
aged to break loose from the detective's grasp. In an instant both had
drawn their pistols, and it seemed as though the life and death contest was.
to be decided then and there. â Jus\then the footfalls of running men were
heard approaching. They were th. officers Kato had sent for. The woman
sprang suddenly aside and disappeared in the direction of her house,
closely followed by the officers unter the guidance of Kato. The house
was then surrounded and vigilantly guarded by one party of officers
while another entered and began \ thorough search with lanterns and
torches. Every room and closet W*a thoroughly and systematically ex
plored, but without success, to the intense disappointment of. the omwrs.
"We must now try the basement," said Kato, taking a crowbar and be
ginning to pry un the flooring at ore end of the kitchen. Just then a
terrific explosion from beneath shook the building, tearing up the flooring
and sending the debris flying in every direction the officers narrowly
escaping with their lives. Detective Is.\to. though thrown from the house
by the force of the explosion, at once recovered his composure ana sat
down in a corner of the grounds to watch the house, which was now almost
buried In smoke and flame. The entir* neighborhood was aroused and
came running to the scene to assist in the removal of such' articles or
value In the shape of furniture, etc.. as it was still possible to save. Among
other things a number of wooden and bamboo trunks were taken ont and
set by the fence so as to be out of danger. Suddenly Detective Kato, wno
had been narrowly watching the proceedings from his post of vantage,
signaled to the officers to come to his assistance. Pointing to one of the
larepst of the trunks he gave orders that i; be securely roped and carried
to the police station. On its arrival there the lid was unfastened and out
there stepped with an air of bold defiance a beautiful woman â the same
who had originally been the wife of the rich merchant, and subse
quently the paramour of the assassin, Goto, both of whom she had mur-
undfrstand how the committee came to
give you that medal. You don't deserve
it. The idea of making so bad use of
so great a subject! Now. this is what
you want to do. Put Columbus over
on one side, paint a side view of him.
Do it this way," and he illustrated with
his expressive gestures how the figure
was to be drawn. "Now, don't paint on
your little canvas. I'll give you a
studio that three men have now. I'll
turn them all out. You can have it by
yourself. There we'll put a canvas
thirty feet wide, and I want you to
paint this picture this way. In one. in
two years, you will have produced a
painting. If I have any influence with
your Government it will be in Wash
ington. It will be in the Capitol. It
wiil make you famous."
Of course I was pleased. I was more;
I was touched. But I didn't have
money enough to work one or two years
en one or two months longer, and
I told him so frankly.
"You don't need money," said Piloti.
"The academy, the Government will
pay your expenses, will hire your stu
dio, give you your paints, buy you your
canvas, engage you your model."
I thanked him. but I went back to
my studio and resumed my single can
vas nnd tried to reach the hearts of
the Munich art dealers. This, will show
you how the master regarded me even
before I had submitted the picture that
gave me my first successful order.
While I was painting the portraits of
the children Piloti asked me how I was
getting along with my Columbus pic
ture. I had not begun it. I never
had any intention of beginning it, and
I didn't know exactly what to say to
him. Suddenly an inspiration came to
me.
"Do you think, Herr Director." said
I. "that Munich is the place to paint
thia picture in? Isn't Salamanca a bet- \
ter place?"
"Quite right," returned the master.
"Of course. Come to think of it, your
models here are all Bavarians. You
want Spaniards for models. Wait im- j
til you go to Salamanca. Do it there." j
That is the last I ever heard of my j
Columbus composition. But I have the i
original among my paintings in my stu- j
dio now.
What Is my rule for success in art?
Tears ago I thought that nature was
master. Now I know different. Art
transcends nature. One must paint
what is behind the eye of the artist.
As I paint, and I love to paint, there is
somebody standing by my shoulder who
says to me. "Don't paint that" or "paint
that." and I follow these directions. I
almost see this somebody. It is con
science personified. It "speaks to mÂ°

ever it is possible, whether it be well
done or badly done. I paint if [ havo

is painted there. It's in my mind. I

lam always at work on it. My beat
picture is still unpainted, and I hope
the time will never come when I shall
look at that canvas and say "There is
my best picture."
Jlrt Fpeak. of tfte Season.
Early in the autumn it was an
nounced that James McN. Whistler and
Frederick C. Mac Monies, the sculptor,
had, opened a school of drawing and
painting in Paris. Although the world
is well used to the eccentricities of Mr.
Whistler and is not surprised at any
thing he may choose to do, such was
not the case in this instance. Whistler,
as the painter, the author, the wit. the
friend of no man, was a familiar figure,
but as a teacher â that was a new role,
and the art world of Paris was immedi
ately all attention. Talk was rife in the
studios and predictions of success or
failure plentiful, with the weight oC
opinion mostly in the latter scale.
The school opened and studerfc
flocked to its doors and the classes im
mediately became so full that large
numbers had to be turned away. The
peculiar personality of Whistler had
been depended upon, nc doubt, to at
tract women, and tbÂ« :-'fÂ»ct is that the
majority of the apt .<.,.. -ta have been
women. The men vren not convinced.
The arrangement was that Mr
Whistler would criticize on Wednesday
and Mr. MacMonntea on Saturday The
announcement that the latter was to
teach drawing and painting occasioned
no little surprise on this side of the
water, for it is not very generally
known that he has painted for several
years and exhibited often at the S
Those who have seen these exhibits de
scribe them as â¢'strong," virile work,
but very Salonlike, meaning thereby
that they are good, but interesting al
most entirely from the artists point of
view. In America MacMonnies is known
almost exclusively as a sculptor.
From latest reports, although many
students are still at work in th- Whist
ler classes, a large number have left,
and the failure of the school seems a
matter of only a sort time. For some
reason, which is unknown, Mr. Mac-
Monnies had refused to criticize any
: more. What most astonished the stu
! dents was the character of the criti
! cism. Whistler, contrary to all expec
i tations, spoke mostly of the drawing,
' whereas MacMonnies, who would be
' supposed most interested in form, critl
i cized color exclusively.Catching Salmon

This statement ?eems extravagant,
5 â¢â  yet the logic of calculation proves It.
Tt is calculated that the productiveness
of the female sockeye salmon is 3000
eggs. Assume that all arrive at ma
turity and that half that number, de
\ clop into female salmon. The first
generation would consist of two, tne

the fourth generation of â well, the lino
type cannot keep up with the proces
sion of "o's". Or, to put it in another
way, it is estimated that 5,500,000 sock
eyes were caught in this country alone
in IS'jT. If half these fish had been fe
males and all of their egg capacity had
developed into mature salmon, their
progeny would havw numbered 8,250,
--000,000 fish.
When a few months old the young
sockeye descends the river and goes
to sea, and no man knows where it
spends its time until the fourth year,
when the school returns to its place of
birth to fulfill the functions and com
plete the round of nature.
It is on the return just before or just
after entering the river that the fish
is taken by traps or seines. Traps are
necessarily used in the clear phos
phorescent waters of the Sound. In
general a trap consists of a row of
piles driven from the shore out into
deep water. This row is frequently sev
eral hundred feet long, from above
the line of high water to the bottom of
the Sound a net is hung, making, as it
were, a fence. As the schools of sal
mon sweep along the shore they en
counter the net, and leading along it
enter the heart of the trap through an
entrance which., however, does not
as an exit. The heart or trap
proper is a large bag hung from the
piles, and is generally forty feet square
and forty feet deep. From the trap the
salmon are taken in scows to the can
nery. As they are thrown from the
scow into a hoist which lands them on
the cannery floor, they are counted for
the first and only time.
In most canneries Chinamen are em
ployed to do the work. They are paid
by the case. A canner, for instance,
makes a contract with a Chinese con
tractor to furnish men enough to pack
25,000 cases at a price ranging from 40
to 45 cents per case. If the output is
over 26,000 cases the Chinamen are paid
for the surplus. If less the canner has
to settle with the Chinamen for the dif
ference between the amount packed
and his guarantee.
The first operation in the cannery is
called "butchering," that is, the head,
fins and tail are taken off and the en
trails removed. Thji fish now go into
the "sliming" tank, where they are par
tially washed, thence into a second
tank, where they are washed thor
oughly. The fish now go to the power
cutterâ a series of revolving knives,
which cut each fish into the length of
a can. Next, by hand, the fish is cut
lengthwise into pieces that will go into
B can. The can has no top on up to
the present. There is a small quan
tity of salt In the can, and the fish is
put in on top of that.
The can now filled with fish goes to
the washing machine, which not cmly
washes the oil off the outside of the
can, but also packs the meat down In
the can to permit the "chip" to be put
in and the top to be put on. You have
doubtless noticed two little drops at
solder on the top of a can of salmon,
one in the center, the other anywhere.
Moth of these drops fill holes, but the
top, which is now placed on, has only
the open hole in the center of It. The
can now goes to a crimper, which
squeezes the edge of the top down
against the body, and directly from here
the cans roll on their sides in an in
clined position, with the head lower
than the bottom, through a bath of
acid and then through a bath of solder
kept hot by fires underneath. If any
steam is generated in the can during
this process the top would not stay in
place, hence tlie little open hole In the

center to permit the steam to escape,
and hence that "chip" of tin to keep the
fish from plugging the hole at this end,
From the soldering machine the cans
roll down a long incline, the hut solder
meantime settling in the Beam. There
is a fascination in watching cans dodge
around the crimping machine, take a
taste of acid, struggle through the hot
r ai:d then chase one after the
othei d.-wii the incline at the rate of
200 a minute. Â».
At the end of the incline they run
under a spray of water to cool the hot
solder and are there caught and placed
in "coolers." Now for the first test
and tests come frequently. Each cooler
is lowered into a tank of clear water.
If any can ieaks the fact is betrayed
by little bubbles. Those that leak are
taken out and carried to the hand
solderers, who are remarkably expert.
One cooler of cans is placed on another
on a small iron cart until they are
about six high. One cart after another
la loaded and they are all roiled into a
steam box where the lish are given the
first cooking. This is an occasion of
surprise to many. But it is a fact that
the raw fish is cooked for the first time
in a tightly sealed can. The tempera
ture is about 212 degrees. After being
about an hour in this temperature the
cans are rolled out and the top of each
can is punctured by striking it with
a mallet which has a steel point in its
face. The oil and steam spurt out and
there is many a merry little fountain.
As soon as the fountains cease this
second hole is plugged with solder and
the cans rolled into the retort, a thing
looking something like a boiler except
that the whole end opens to admit the
cans. Just before going into the retort
the cans are tested again in a similar
way to that described. In the retort
the salmon gets a second cooking at Â»
temperature of about 240 degrees. When
the coolers are taken out of the retort
they are washed in a bath of caustic
soda* then washed off with fresh water
and carted to the cooling floor, where
they stand until cool. Then they are
tested again, but this time they are
tapped with a little steel rod and the
sourd given forth determines whether
the can is tight. Now lacquering comes.
This is to keep the can from rusting.
Next the label is put on showing the
brano. of salmon inside. Then the can
is wrapped in tissue paper, then put in
a box with forty-seven mates, and
shipped by rail or boat.
The sockeye is not the only salmon
canned. The tyee or spring, the Bilver,
th- humpback and the qualah, or "dog,"
are also packed. They are all choice
food âii, but the epicurean world has
gotten accustomed to looking for the
red color in salmon and will take noth
ing else. The world needs educating,
however, in the salmon line.
At the height of the season, when 200 |
to 300 people are fairly jumping to pack ;
20,000 to 30,000 fish in a day, the sight
about a cannery is an enlivening one. i
The wages paid are good, unskilled
help sometimes at filling alone earning
$2 per day. On the other hand, while ,
the construction of a cannery involves:
an investment of $10,000 to $20,000, the
amount of capital to handle she product
is about $3 per case; helce it may
safely be assumed that a cannery that
produces 150,000 cases in a season must
have a working capital of about $400,
--000.
At times flp.h have come in such num
bers as to be a drug on the market,
unsalable at any price whatever, down
to two cents a flsh, though these times
will probably never come ascain. The
writer has seen 4W)O flsh thrown away
because they could not be handled be
fore they spoiled; has seen flsh sold at
two cents and has seen the same kind
of fish sold at 25 cents each. Some
years there is a rare profit in the busi
ness of canning salmon; other years the
balance Is on the other side of the j
ledger.
The sportsman will sigh as he thinks
of the millions of salmon caught for
commercial purposes with no regard
for his feelings. Well, all salmon are
not to be tempted into taking a bait of
any kind, but some of the most royal
sport to be found the world over is here
on Puget Sound at certain seasons of
the year.
The steelhead salmon, which is
doubtless an ocean trout and not a sal
mon at all, is now running and will be
caught in nets during the next two
months. Probably this fish might be
allured into taking a bait, but the wet
winter months do not tempt sportsmen
out for experiments. The steelhead is
the great shipping fish for winter and
commanded during the latter days of
December 25 cents a pound wholesale
In New York City.
The spring salmon will follow the
steelhead in March and will be caught
This fish sometimes
in weight. It does
as late as August,
reaches 75 pounds
not take a bait.
The sockeye salmon will come In July
and run in countless schools. It will
weigh six or seven pounds. Neither
does it take a bait, and in fact few men
can tell what it lives on, for nothing
is found in its stomach when caught.
In September and October the silver
salmon come, and every second year
humpbacks come with them or
shortly _ after, and then follow the
qualah or "dog" salmon.
But the silver salmon is the sports
men's delight. He will weigh from ten
to fifteen pounds and is generally
caught with a trolling spoon; some
times on a light rod. He who gets a
silver on a seven-ounce rod has more
business to the square inch on hand
than he often finds. This fall out of a
school of silver salmon within a few
miles of this city Â«iO,OOO fish were taken
In nets. The sportsman who trolled
among that Bame school took â well, a
whole boatload, for they didn't count
them.
It has been stated that less than 2
per cent of the eggs of a female salmon
develop and mature -as salmon. By
artificial propagation over 98 per cent
of the eggs reach the stage of young
salmon. It is therefore to the present
hatcheries and to the proposed large
increase in the number of hatcheries,
that the State of Washington looks for
the perpetuation of her important sal
mon industry. _ J. M. BELL.
Millionaire Lipton's Three Great Ambitions
To Found the Greatest Charity Organization in the World, to Beat the "Yankees"
in the Jiext International Yacht Race and to Sain a Place in
the British Peerage.
SPENDING FORTUNES AND WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO ATTAIN THE THREE OBJECTS.
Special to The Sunday Call.
LONDON, Jan. 2.â Sir Thomas
Lipton, the "most astonishing
citizen of London," has planned
to do three astonishing things
during the year 1899.
Firstâ To found the Alexandra
trust; cost, $1,000,000.
Secondâ To win the America cup;
cost $300,000.
Thirdâ To gain a British peerage.
The first is a plan of, practical phil
anthropy, the second is in the spirit of
good natured international rivalry for
yacht sailing championship, and the
elevation to the British peerage is an
honor which probably awaits Sir
Thomas as a reward at the hand of
Queen Victoria if his boat shows her
heels to the American sailors, and Brit
ish supremacy is thus again estab
lished.
Sir Thomas' motto is, "The Lipton
flag never has been hoisted in vain,"
and he firmly expects to carry out his
three plans.
Reward of Charity.
When the Queen's jubilee dinner for
the London poor was in danger of fall
ing through by the penuriousness of the
English public, Thomas Lipton came
forward and gave Â£25,000, and thus
made it possible for the committee to
feed 110,000 of the poor of London. For
that and other charities he was knight
ed, and then last summer he announced
that he was ready to give half a mil
lion of dollars in the starting of the
Alexandra trust for furnishing cheap
and good meals to the poor, and had
another $f>oo,ooo to add to the fund if
the system proves a success. Its pa
tronesses is the Princess of Wales, a
good person to know when one wishes
to be a peer â and the trust was named
in her honor. The Alexandra scheme
is much along the line of the soup
kitchens which have proved such a suc
cess in Vienna, but Mr. Lipton's wide
business experience has suggested a
great many details which will be new
In such movements. He has given
much sympathetic attention in the past
to the fare of the lower classes, and
says it is not only of poor quality, bad
ly cooked and untidily served, but costs
too much to those who can ill afford it.
All of these faults he plans to remedy
by a good bowl of soup, or bread or
meat, well cooked and served for a
halfpenny. For twopence a fair meal
| can be bought, the diner having be
yond this a considerable range in pric*
| and selection. This is the object of the
I Alexandra trust.
So soon as the necessary charter Is
secured a large dining establishment
Will be opened in the poorest quarter of
the city, and other places of the kind
will follow so soon as it is shown that
the plan is a success. Sir Thomas de
signs to make the institution eventu
ally self-supporting by the purchase of
property in several places about town.
And he is quite business man enough
to do it.
Small Fish Dealers
Opposition to the Alexandra trust has
developed from the keepers of small
fish shops and coffee houses, who say
they will be driven out of business if
Lipton enters the field. They have been
memorializing the committee on
charters asking that a permit be not
granted, and their union is making
ready to present their side of the
matter before Parliament when it
meets in February. These small vic
tualers claim that food in London is
cheap enough for anybody already, and
that lowering the price of living will
simply mean that the present number
of loafers about the public houses will
be immensely multipled.
Lipton is not discouraged by the op
position aroused, and says thai the
plan will prove a public blessing if
once tried, and this view is shared by
the Princess of Wales, the Duke of
Norfolk and Sir Francis Jeune, who
are associated with the promoter of the
enterprise. There is little doubt that
the royal charter will be granted, and
that the interesting experiment will be
inaugurated next year.
Plan to Beat the Yankees.
By a little dinner party held in the
Savoy Hotel a few nights ago, the
building plans for the Irish yacht,
Shamrock, were finally discussed and
agreed upon, and the keel of the trim
racer will now shortly be laid in the
Harland & Wolff yards at Belfast. Her
plans have been approved, but just
what those plans call for is known only
by a select coterie, ,who after dinner at
the Savoy turned all of the waiters oui
of the room, locked the doors and held
a star chamber session to go over the
plans again and give the final building
orders. Those present were Sir Thomas
Lipton, owner of the Shamrock that is
to be; William Fife Jr., the designer;
W. J. Pirrie, director of the Harland ft
Wolff shipyard; Hugh McGlldowney,
. the Belfast yachtsman; Baron Russell,
Lord Chief Justice of England, and his
son, Charles Russell.
"England and Scotland have both
fought for the America cup. but Ireland
never," said Sir Thomas, when, after
due persuasion, he was prevailed upon
to talk for publication on his .Shamrock
hopes. "I have been a member of the
Royal Ulster Yacht Club for some
years, and as one whose parents belong
to the north of Ireland, though I was
born in Glasgow, I have long had a
notion of sending an Irish challenge for
the cup, but one thing or another in
the past haa prevented me putting it
into execution. Over ten years ago I
went so far as to make an offer through
Hon. W. J. Lane of the New York Life
pany, then a member of Parlia
ment for Cork, to race for the America
cup, providing I could pret a yacht de
signed, built and manned by Irishmen,
but the matter fell through.
"What I have always aimed at has
been a challenge from an Irish yacht
club, by an Irish built boat, by an Irish
designer, sailed by an Irish skipper and
crew and bearing, I need hardly say,
an Irish ivime. All these essentials,
with the exception of the designer, will
be fulfilled when, the new Shamrock
meets her American rival.
Will Spend a Fortune.
"I do not wish to speak boastfully,
but I am prepared to spend Â£50,000 to
Â£60,000 to lift that cup. But money Is
not the only consideration, as brains
are needed.
"It was only after careful considera
tion that we decided to give the dsign
ing order to Mr. Fife, whom we have
every confidence in. and he- thinks he
can justify it. Fife believes that hith
erto, the best boat has won in the cup
contests," said Mr. Lipton.
An Irishman for Cuptain.
Captain William O'Neill will skip
per the new boat. He comes of a
seafaring family and is counted the
smartest sailing master along- the Irish
coasts, although his initial races on the
Thames in IST4 went against him. and
he wanted tn leave his command after
the first defeat Then hia luck changed,
and for a half dozen years he kept his
boat, the Mynsotis. at the head of the
winning list. Skice then he has al
most steadily kept first place with what
ever boat he has been engaged to cap
tain, winning thirty prizes In a single
season with the Annasona, a Fife cut
ter.
"I have laid down no new conditions
as to the race, but will leave all ar
rangements to the holders <>l the cup."
continued Mr. Lipton. "I know the
States well, and a fairer cr more sports
manlike body of men never lived than
I American yachtsmen. 1 am sure I
i shall get fair play from them, as I
â  know of no place where a Britisher can
;go where he will receive more true
I kindness or be better treated than at
j the hands of our American cousins."
Worth $20,000,000.
Twenty millions of dollars is what the
j Liplon fortune is accounted at present,
and this is being added to rapidly by
the receipts which daily roll into the
counting- house in City Road from the
j immense provision business of the coin
j pany around the world. As one looks
over the large and beautiful room
where scores of clerks and typewriters
are at work on the corporation's ac
counts he sees a little of the perfection
in the immense system which makes
to-day's quotation of the "Upton, Lim
â  ited," stock on the exchange sell at
I nearly two and ,pne-half times above
I par. Sir Thomas Insists that in every
department of his mighty business an
tiquated English methods be cast aside
and down-to-date American ways of
doing business alone be employed,
which accounts in large part for his
being able to spend a million or two
offhand, as he is doing in his yacht and
Alexandra enterprises.
Mr. Lipton takes a few hundred of his
employes now and again out to Osidge,
his beautiful country residence ai
Bouthgate, where he invites them to
I take full possession of the place in the
holiday he gives them. The American.
[ and British flags in the decorations al
wayfl tell that the host is an Anglo-
American. He likes fast horses as
I as a swift business and daily drives a
â  speedy span imported from Kentucky
over the ten miles between his country
home and city offices.
And all this charity, this touching the
pride of the Britisher in championing
British seamanship, this tremendous
1 activity in making friends with royalty,
this genius for money getting, is lead
ing straight toward the greatest of all
at Llpton's plans â the elevation to the
peerage. I suggested the rumors about
his possible elevation to him the other
day, but, of course, he wisely professes
never to have dreamed of such a thing.

GOSSIP OF A SOCIETY BUD
DEARF.ST MARGTERITE â Gos-
Blps are born, not made. Your
real gossip, like the babbling
brook, runs on forever and a day.
It's a greatness that cannot be
thrust upon you. So I'm going To stop
tying the gossip's cap under your dimpled
chin.
Society has taken off Its blase mask of
indifference and is greeting '98 with a gay
and smiling countenance. Bach new leaf
of the calendar that '99 unfolds is more
promising than the last. Red letter days
are scattered through the season. But
the to-morrows cannot possibly snatch
the laurel wreath from hist Monday's
brow. We crowned her (â jueen-nlght of
the year at the Sprockets ball.
Mr. and Mrs. John D. Spreckels gave
the ball to introduce their two daughters
Into society's charmed circle. The hail
was decked as it has never been before.
The music floated through the green lat
tice work of palms that hid the stage.
And everybody was thereâ from the dear
old gentlemen who used to let mo "see
the wheels go wound" in their watches to
bo\ s who let me spin their tops.
There were four dinners, that I know
of. Kiven before the dance. We ate, drank
and made merry around the daintiest of
tables, presided over by Daisy Van Ness.
Her sister, Mrs. de Ruyter, was her right
hand bower and the hours chased each
other so quickly that it was almost 12
when we arrived at the ball.
The guests whom Mis. Knight and Mrs.
Gentle had entertained at dinner came
just as we did. fcieieh Wagner aim Mr.
Greenway. who hud been a.x Mrs. Gers
ue s, mm me that they thought it was
but 11. Helen confessed that the sixty
minutes had slipped trom her wtule Bhe
was admiring tin- table decorations; But
Mr. Greenway was nut as frank. He
would net say where he had uiopped Ins
lost hour.
There were loads of people there, whom
I liiU not even know uy sight, but there
were enough "familiars" to feel at home.
And its much more interesting to >s
who is who than m always be sure of
Just what's what. There were dozens of
people thai 1 didn't get a chance to Bay
"good evening" to, but by 8 or 4 o'clOCK
we had said good morning. Jt was long
after ."> when we reached come.
Let X represent the belle of the ball.
Then solve the problem by any process
known if you can. 1 was determined to
iuul her. if such a creature is really in
our midst, so 1 put the question to every
"in- 1 knew. And from their answers 1
ran say conclusively that the. belle of thÂ«
ball is an unknown quantity.
is it the prettiest girl or the most beau
tifully gowned girl or the most popular
girl? A combination of all three answer
the sages. But where, O wise men, will
you find this combination?
Kvery one, or almost every one, said
that Theresa Morgan had on the most
stunning gown in the room. Therese is
simply a genius when it comes to plan-
Ming a gown that is unlike lliat of any-
Dudy else. But then pa's rich and ma
don't care.
Josie .Loughborough and Ethel Patton
divided the honors among the younger
girls. Ethel's black gown was extremely
becoming. However, all the girls looked
so pretty that a modern Purls with a sin
gle apple would have made apple sauce of
it, to make it go round.
Two or thre.e people whispered secrets
into my ear at the ball because they know
1 never tell. Harry llolbrook told me the
tirst one to the tune of a two-step. After
he finished telling me it sounded more like
a funeral dirge. Harry Stetson is going
away forever and ever so long, to travel
around the world and all sorts of other
horrid things. It's dreadful to think of
TUP.F QUEEcN RETIRES.
The retirement of Mrs. Ella Offutl
Pepper from the turf, after one of the
most brilliant seasons of success ever
scored by a Kentucky devotee of the
thoroughbred, is considered a great loss
to turf sports. She had one of the best
stables out the past season. She placed
the horses in the hands of that astute
turfman and trainer, H. Eugene Leigh,
and his successful preparation and
selection of jockeys, coupled with his
skill in placing the horses in company
they could defeat, won for Mrs. Pepper
hug.' sums of money in stakes and
purses, and in bets with the book
makers. Stories are told of big amounts
being wagered on single events, and it
is said that on one race Mrs. Pepper
won besides the purse something like
$3000 from the layers of odds. When
the season was over many of her
friends advised her to keep the horses
and to race them next year, but she
declined 'this advise and offered the
horses at public outcry.
She shrewdly saw that the horses
would bring more money when their
prestige was fresh in the minds of pros
pective purchasers, besides, she would
be taking no risks on the horses dying
or getting out of condition. Then she
wanted the money for a purpose, and
that purpose was to assist her husband,
Colonel James E. Pepper, in again get
ting a controlling interest in the dis
tillery that bears his name. It will be
remembered that Colonel Pepper failed
during the early part of last year, and
that Mrs. Pepper, who had money in
her own right, bought in the property,
including the thoroughbreds.
Mrs. Pepper, who has been the means
of restoring the colonel to his old po
sition in the distillery, was one of the
most beautiful women in Kentucky,
When, as Miss Ella Offutt, she was a i
social favorite in Louisville, Shelby- !
vill. , Lexington and other Kentucky
Cities. â litxington Correspondence of

Then the whispers of a big Mardl Gras
< ball that have plaj ed hide and seek
around the corridors of the Hopkins
house have been caught at last. It's to
be held February 11. But there's a se
-1 cret within this secret. It's really going
to be a society affair this year. That in.
it Mr. Qreenway am) a number of others
!;â  ep their promises to the managers. We
I girl 8 have all been approached, and we've
half promised to go. We're really dying
to, but we've never gone before, and the
â¢ idea gives us a sort of burn-your-bridges,
cross -the- Rubicon feeling-.
Marie Oge told me something that I
promised I never would tell. I'm not go
ing to, either. But there isn't any harm
i in telling you that Mr. Williams has gone
ito South Africa. if I did not know that
; he has given his heart awaj I should say
i he carried a very heavy one with him.
For Marie has finally told himâ but that
would be tellir.g. However, if you wish
â  to deduce your own conclusions from the
, data it is as simple as two plus two equals
four.
We rested up sufficiently to thoroughly
enjoy ihe Cinderella dance. We are get
ting to like the reflection of our best bib
and-tucker in the looking glass, and to
don it Quite often. All this season the
Cinderella* have held the palm over the
other cotillons for beautiful gowns and
jewels. At this last one. though, we even
outdid our former brave efforts to look
resplendent.
On Friday night we were to have had
the Greenway. But two nights of the
week had been spent tripping the light
fantastic, so wise mammas said "Nay,
nay, Ned." Therefore, it has been post
poned until the 27th.
All sorts of coming events are casting
their shadows before. They take the form
of teas, dinners and dances. But the one
which we are most eager for is the prom
is*<i ball in the new Spreokels house. It
is such a big, beautiful palace and so
! adapted to entertaining that we are all
standing: on the tlptot of < xpectation.
I called on Mary Bell (iwin and found
thre.- or four of the other girls there
having- a farewell "heart-to-heart." Mary
put an extra lump of sug-ar in our tea,
| but even that could not console us. She
; always lias such a glorious time when
she goes to New Orleans that T believe the
little traitor would willingly spend all her
time there. She did not even have a sus
picion of a tear when she said au revoir.
She says she will not be gone long, and
we try to believe it.
PegV, dear, I think I've told you all
that I should â perhaps a little bit more.
But I'm sun- you won't mind. The next
best thing' to being a gossip yourself is to
appreciate one. Lovingly,

BIS EVENTS IJi RELIGION FOR, 1899.
By Rev. Heber Newton.
IIIESTTATE at the office which you
kindly ask me to assume. The
prophet's mantle does not slip
easily upon my shoulders. I find
hindsight much easier than fore
sight. Nevertheless, I am convinced
that the coming year, the last year of
our present century, is fraught with big
events. Occult and mystic thought for
a long time looked ahead to the close
of this century as to a critical era. The
old evangelicalism of theology, inter
preting the Old Testament prophecies,
expected the coming of Christ some
where in the latter part of this century.
As we understand the second coming of
Christ, it means a great spiritual re
formation, or renaissance, or reviving,
or a new illumination, a row vlvlflea
tion of Christendom. There are many
things that look like the fulfillment.
even In the last year of this century,
of this belief of our fathers.
One of the curious things connected
with this occult and mystic and pro
phetic onlooking of the end of this cen
tury is the confident expectation of our
evangelical fathers that the Old Testa
ment prophecies would be literally ful
filled In the return of the Jews to the
Holy Land. Surely the Zionist move
A WOMAN'S PpiDE
I will not look for him. I will not hear
My heart's loud beating, as 1 strain to see
(Vcross the rain forlorn and hopelessly.
Nor, starting, think 'tia he that draws so
near.
I will forget how tenderly and dear
Iff might in coming hold his arms to me,
For 1 will prove what woman's pride
<mii he â 
When faint love lingers in the darkness
drear.
I will notâ ah, but should he come to
night
I think my life, might break thro very
bliss,
This little will should be so torn apart.
That all my soul might fall in golden
And let me die; so do I long for this.
Ah, love, thine eyesâ nay, loveâ thy heart,
thy heart!

thing we see in the papers, yet, should
the rumor be correct, he would not be j
unwelcome. In the present circum
stances a word or two concerning him
may be of interest.
At present a colonel of the Guards at
St. Petersburg, he has three character

ment, so full of vitality, looks strangely
like this word of the ancient writ. Per
haps we may have to revise some of our
notions concerning the Old Testament
prophecies should such an event come
to pass.
One thing that greatly interests me
as a forecast of tho close of the century
is the remarkable movement toward re
ligious unity, which 1 egan, as far as an
outward pxnr-ssion of It goes, in the
World's Parliament of Religion in Chi
cago, and which has continued since in
the Congress of Liberal Religions h> |
each year in some great city of
â¢Westâ though attracting little notice in
the East. The next meeting is to be
held somewhere East this coming year:
! and the following year it is hoped thnt
the meeting will be in London. This

CYRANO
CHAINS
SDME wiseacre should make remarks
upon the prevalence of several sorts
of endless chains. The windows of
the shops where jewelry novelties
are sold are hung with countless strings
of colored glass beads, named for un
known reasons "Cyrano" chains. The
fancy for wearing purse or lorgnette or
ether knicknack on a long chain around
\hf neck has revived and Increased. Some
chains are composed entirely of uncolored
cut crystals the siae of peas. Others are
of alternating black and white, blue and
white, brown and white, all pearls, all
amber, or, choicest in the ordinary collec
tion, cut and polished coral, alternating
with fine crystals. Every dress color may
be matched in these glass bits, and it is
the thing for a girl who can afford it to
own half a dozen Cyrano chains, in as
many hues, to blend with her costumes.
She who cannot revel in much glass se
lects beads of black or white or blue and
white. It Is becoming unusual to see a
carefully dressed woman without some
trinket on a fanciful string around hÂ«r
neck.
UNIQUE
EARINGS
THE present craze for earrings has
found many women whose ears have
not been pierced, and women often
hesitate to inflict upon themselves
what will be a disfiguration when the
fashion shall have gone the way of all
fashions. But the new earrings need no
piercing: of ears, for they are simply a
bit of gold filigree that catches the lobe
of the far and may or may not support
jewels, says a New York exchange. Neck
chains are worn with every kind of a cos
tume, and heavy gold ones, with no rai
son d'etre save to carry a locket or orna
ment, are becoming more and more pop
ular. A profusion of Jewels seems to be
the fashion this season, and the jewelers
pronounce the ruby to be the most fash
ionable stone. It is the proper clasp for
the pearl dog collar that is worn even
with elaborate high-necked gowns.
BRACELETS

a large ring, without opening, not unlike
the plain gold ring for the finger, about a
quarter to half on Inch broad, and is, of
course, large enough to slip over the
hand. The simplicity of this dainty or
nament is in pleasing contrast to the
lavishment of design snown in most of the
accessories of the toilet at present, and
this accounts doubtless for a part of its
popularity.
Though the plain ones are most in de
mand, some very pretty bracelets are fin
ished with from one to seven stones set
across the back. For this purpose tur
quoise is the most popular stone, though
all of the semi-precious stones are used,
particularly those which are opaque, as
this bracelet is supposed to be worn at
all times.
The very newest thing in bracelets for
evening wear is a narrow gold ring with
a bangle, which is formed of a single
chain about four or five Inches long, set
at short intervals with large stones.
Each gem is different, and all are ar
ranged with deference to some definite
color scheme, one shade blending gradu

the next.

FROM the vast number of distress
ful wails that come to me from
all directions I have about de
cided that superfluous hair is the
source of more anxiety and worry
to womankind than almost any
other facial blemish. Even the first gray
hair, which strikes siich horror to a
woman's soulâ also the first wrinkleâare
obliged to take a back seat as a cause of
unhapplness to the mind feminine. It cer
tainly would be much more civil of the
hair if it would prow "on the top of the
head, in the place where the hair ought to
grow," Instead of persisting in distrib
uting Itself all over the "face, where well
regulated hair has no business to grow.
To get rid of it is an easy matter, but to
prevent its coming back is much more
difficult. Even if it would come back
alone and unattended one might put up
with Jt, but in almost every case' not only
does it persistently return, but it brings
with it all "its sisters and Its cousins
and Its aunts."
There are two kinds of superfluous hair.
There Is a kind called lanugo, which is
mere down, soft and often very thick in
growth, that appears upon the upper lip,
the lateral parts of the face and upon
the outer side of the arms.
The other kind of superfluous hair con

The same treatment does not equally
suit both. t â¢ â â --â â 
There are several methods by which
superfluous hair may be removed. The
commonest of these is by means of depil
atory powders, which are usually com
posed of sulphide of 'â¢ arsenic or caustic
lime. These however, merely burn the
hairs off and, of course, the roots being
unaffected, the hairs will reappear ana
the depilatory must be used again.

PERHAPS you have already

Perhaps you have not bought
nine flower pots with choice plants.
If so, felicitations!
For though countless people in this
city have paid for the privilege of pos
sessing those self-same pots, not one
of the purchasers has ever so much as
caught a whiff of their fragrance.
The reason is a simple one. The
plants are not children of the sun and
dew and earth. They are nothing but
the bloÃsoms of an impostor's imagina
tion.
So if a glib, fairly well-dressed man
offers to let you have nine tlower Dots
providing you pay for moving them,
hold fast to him. He's the man half
of San Francisco is looking for. When
they find him, his flower-strewn nath
will be changed to one of thorns.
He is In the flower business, but he
does not ply his trade with gardener's
Implements. A ready tongue, a facile
wit and a convincing manner are his
stock in trade.
With variations, to suit the occasion,
the following ia the pitfall which he
digs for his victims:
"Hello, Jones, old man!"
Jones â Hello! (aside) where have I
met this fellow?
"Still living on Webster street,

"Well 1 helped an expressman move
a family out of that neighborhood, and
they left nine flower puts with mighty
fine plants. Landlord doesn't want
them. Thought perhaps you might."
Jones â Of course I do. My wife is
crazy about flowers. But how can I
get them?
"Well, I could bring them to the
house. They're too heavy to carry at
once, though. I'll have to take the car
and make several trips."
Jones â All right; here's a dollar.
That's all right, don't mention It; you

a moment's contact with the skin sharply

come with It.
However, when pulled with tweezers or
removed In this" way, it but scatters the
rooi, as a rule, and three or four hairs
will return in the place of the one re
moved.
Then there is the solvent method, which
claims to dissolve the roots. It is neces
sary to use the tweezers or resin stick in
connection with this method, which is sup
posed to dissolve the natural fat of the
hair follicles and thereby render the
hairs loose and easy* to pluck out.
I^astly, there is the galvanic method,
which is known as electrolysis. This con
sists of inserting a needle as fine as a hair
Into the hair follicle anfi destroying the
hair by the electric current. This loosens
the hair, which Is then removed by means
of tweezers. A slight redness sometimes
followed by the formation of a jOletit
pustule, results from the operation, which,
however, soon disappears. If the opera
tor is skillful and experienced no scar
should result.
Even this method is not always success
ful, for If the base of the follicle is not
reached by the needle the hair will sprout
again and the operation will have to be
repeated. Of course electrolysis is only
applicable to the separate, stiff hairs, as
it would be an Intolerably tedious pro
cess if applied to mere down, and the time
and trouble it would Involve would cost
a fortune.
A smoothly cut piece of pumice stone

the skin so that they are not discernible'
Or, if the hairs are dark, apply
peroxide of hydrogen, to which a little
liquid ammonia has been added. The
peroxide will bleach the hairs and the
ammonia will sometimes deaden the little
pests after long usage.

wiser to leave severely alone. It is not

fancy it is. and a depilatory powder Is
almost certain to make the hair grow In

M. V. W.-I think you will find the com
obliged to you. Come and have some
thing before you go.
So in addition to pocketing all the
way from 25 cents to $1 on this scheme
this flower-pot fraud usually gets some
liquid refreshment in addition. And
worst of all, Mr. J. immediately tele
phones home to Mrs. J.
"Hello! 11
"I've got some new plants for you,
beauties."
"What kind? Oh, pinks, and two Am
erican Beauties, and â I forget what the
rest are. I think he said nine.
"No, no, not much. I don't have to
buy them. They're in pots already,
pretty ones, too. Good-by."
Then for two long days Mr. and Mrs.
J. watch in vain for the plants that
never come. At nightfall Mr. J. steals
out, a sadder and wiser man. and by
patronizing the florists, quiets a mock
ing tongue.
This plant philanthropist does not
show any undue partiality toward his
own sex. Almost as many women
have been duped. He wards off sus
picion by jocularly remarking as he de
parts with the necessary money to
move the plants: "Don't be surprised
if I never come back. I may spend this
in riotous living." His seemingly hon
est countenance and this joking man
ner of throwing suspicion on himself
are marvelous aids in disposing of
these Ã¼biquitous nine flowering pots.
Some very queer coincidences have
developed from the purchase of these
vanishing flower pots.
A prominent merchant on Kearnv
street bought them. Now he can tell
at a glance whether a fabric is all-wool
or not. But the flower faker pulled the
wool over his eyes on the flower pot
question.
It happened that on the same even
ing after the salad was served, his
wife casually mentioned that she had
bought a bargain.
Now the merchant, being in the bar
gain business, objects to his wife buy
ing bargains. He has marked $20 suits
down to $30 too often himself to be
caught at the bargain counter.
"Nonsense," he answered. "But that
reminds me, my dear, I captured what
you'd call a bargain to-day that really
is a bargain."
"But so is mmÂ«," protested the wife.
"I bought some flowers for "
"Flowers!" interrupted the merchant,
"and paid fancy florist's prices for
them, of course. Now, I bought some
plants myself tc-day. How much do
you think I paid for them?"
"But thty can't be as cheap us those
I bought, i got mine for nothing, just
had to pay the man for moving thorn."
"Moving them!" and the merchant
pricked up his ears.
"Where are those plants?"
"They haven't come yet. I guess the
rain kept the man from bringing them."
The next instant both explanations
clashed together. Both husband and
wife had bought the plants. Their
stories dovetailed exactly. Same man,
same flower pots, same plants â two
roses, two pinks, etc.

GRACEâ You are right when you say
that true beauty comes from wiihln, for
thore is nothing under the blue dome so
beautifying as sweetness, brightness and
good nature. However, we can add to
these cleanliness, health and a few nice
dabby little things to put on our cheeks
and noses. I don't particularly approve
of using pure cream on the skin, for I
think it makes it more susceptible to the
effects of wind and sunlight. You are
too young to begin "fixing up," as you ex
press it. A little harmless powder will
not injure your complexion, but don't, I
beg of you, use rouge. Get the roses of
health in your cheeks by following a
strictly hygienic method of living, such
an I have given rules for many times in
these talks. After cleansing the skin
with tepid water and castile soap mas
sage it gently with the orange flower skin
food. When the skin seems dull and life
less a patting exercise will help It. By
this I mean just a gentle tattoo with this
fingers over the entire face. I think the
following astringent wash will be better
for your skin than the cucumber milk, on
account of the coarse pores: Take a half
pint bottle and place in it three table
spoonfuls of eau de cologne. Shake well
and add very slowly half an ounce of
simple tincture of benzoin, shaking the
mixture now and then. Fill the bottle
with elder flower water. Be sure that
there are no settlings In the benzoin else
it will be apt to curdle the lotion. This
will whiten the skin and gradually con
tract the pores. If, when washing the
hair, you will use as a shampoo the yolk
of an egg, well beaten In a pint of dis
tilled water, and one ounce of rosemary
spirits I think you will find the hair will

East. Ido not want you to even think
of making any sort of return to me for
any advice that I may give you. lam
pleased to answer ajiy questions that may
be put to me. That is what lam here
for. Write again.
BESSIE D.â The hair tonic that you
had prepared will do equally as well as
the one I advised. They are practically
the same. If you will always use the
yolks of two eggs well beaten with a
pinch of borax and a pint of warm water
when you wash your hair the golden tints
will be less likely to vanish.
LYDIAâ I would rather not give for
mula for a depilatory powder. In fact, I
have none that I am perfectly sure would
prove harmless. However, you can get
them in any drug store, if you wish to
take the chances. The pumice stone will
have exactly the same effect. Possibly
to-day's Beauty Talk will contain a hint
for you.
L. H. S. â You ask about oily skins. Last
Sunday's Beauty Talk contained a fund
of information on this point. An excel
lent bust and neck food is made by mix
ing equal parts of cocoa-butter, lanoline
and cocoanut oil. No, I really do not think
that hair can be made to grow upon a
hfad that has been bald for years. At
any rate I have no knowledge of any pro
cess by which such a result might be
brought about. I am sorry.
MiSS H. â I have never known of a case
similar to yours. Were I in your place
I should aiso hesitate to use grease of
any sort upon my face. There is some
thing abnormal about such a condition
and my best advice to you would be to
consult a skilled dermatologist. The cu
cumber lotion cannot possibly injure your
skin and may be allied undiluted with a
small sponge or soft cloth. Once a day
will be often enough to apply it. Use the
following tonic on the falling hair: Four
ounces eau de cologne, one-half ounce
tincture of cantharides, and one-fourth
dram each of oil of lavender and oil of
rosemary. Apply to the roots once or
twice a "day with a small sponge. Sham
poo every ten days with the liquid soap,
formula for which was given last Sunday
in reply to Pacific. Did you see it?
EAST OAKLANDâ I think you will find
all the Information you wish in to-day's
Beauty Talk. The dermatologist that you
went to Is all right as far as removing
superfluous hairs is concerned. A tonic
made of equal parts of cocoanut oil and
vaseline will make the eyelashes grow,
but I always hesitate to recommend it, as
it is exceedingly difficult to apply with
out getting it into the eyes. If any of
it does get into the eyes it will smart and
the eyes become inflamed.
MISS ANNETTE JONESâ Do not try
to reduce the size of your bust except by
a general reducing of flesh, which can be
A GOWN OF MAUVE MOIRE, TRIMMED WITH RUCHINGS OF MOUSSELINE Df
SOIE, APPLIED IN REDINGOTE. THE CORSAGE IS MADE WITH TWO LONG
POINTED FRONTS OF IRISH GUIPURE, SO SHAPED THAT THEY MEET
UNDER A CRISP BLACK BOW WIRED IN LOUIS XVI FORM,
accomplished by careful dieting. All sort*
of injuries can come about by trying rem
edies that are said to intake the bust
smaller.
MAUDâ For the excessive perspiration
put a little baking powder in your bath,
Maud, and after drying- the body care
fully dust the parts affected with a pow
der made of one part horacic acid, two
parts of precipitated chalk and seven
parts of powdered talcum.
BLUE EYESâ A lunar causticpencil will
remove the wart. Touch the center of the
â wart lightly with the pencil once a day,
taking great care not to get caustic on
any other part of the skin. The wart
will turn black and gradually disappear.
If the wart is very large I would advise
you to go to a dermatologist to have it
removed. As it is on the eyebrow of
course any of the hairs that are touched
with the pencil will fall also.
ARDATHâ The hair will continue to fall
so long as you do not get rid of the dan
druff on your scalp. The following rem
edy I am quite sure will help you: Forty
eight grains of resorcin. one-half ounce of
glycerine and alcohol enough to fill a two
ounce bottle. Apply once a day with a
sponge. Shampoo the hair every two
weeks with the liquid soap referred to in
foregoing reply to Miss H. I do not care
for tar soap for the hair. Its qualities
are very much overestimated. Let me
know how you progress.
MISS AGNESâ lsn't it singular that
gray hair is considered so beautiful by
every one, save the unhappy possessor of
it? There is nothing that will darken the
hair but a dye, and. really, I wouldn't
rest well at night if I felt that I had
been a party in a hair-dying scheme. I
think what your haJr needs is nourish
ment at the roots. A very little olive oil.
slightly warmed and well rubbed into the
scalp with the tips of the fingers will
help you. I am sure. If you will take an
iron tonic, prescribed by a physician per
haps those little white hairs will become
discouraged and cease putting in an ap
pearance. The chin and neck can be
massaged down to smaller proportions by
picking up the flesh between the thumb
and forefinger, and rolling and rubbing
as much you possibly can, without injur
ing the skin. Then, in order to prevent
the flesh from getting flabby, the neck
and chin must be bathed in cold water
in which a small piece of alum the size
of a bean has been dissolved. Of course
the skin must be smeared 'with cold
cream before beginning the massage.
Your question about the electric needle
you will find answered in to-day's
Beauty Talk. I have not thought your
questions foolish by any manner of
means, but most natural. I thank you for
your kindly wishes. MME. HYGEIA.

We sat chatting over our after

occasionally, as men will in the course
of their business life. To-day we had

were not wanted they were to be re

the other extreme is also lacking. Con
sequently the book is a readable one. A
perusal of the pages will be found most
interesting and profitable. Miss Craft has
managed to look at the islands and the
people from several points of view. She
shows the sentimental as well as the

by the grand master's quartet.
There was a large attendance at the

KNIGHTS OF THE MACCABEES.
San Francisco Tent at its last held re
view closed its work for 1898, .which was
a very successful one. and much of the
success Is due to the untiring: efforts of
the following-named Sir Knights: Fred
Waslfer Jr., commander; George V. Leroi,
past commander; D. B. Richards, lieuten
ant commander; I >r. Josef I. Manson,
physician; E. il. Stevens, sergeant; Theo.
Prr.lich, record keeper'; H. H. Castle,
finance keeper; M. R Schofield, chaplain;
A. X. Bowne, master at wms; 1 )r. G.
Danziger, lirst master of guards; Thomp
son White, second master of guards; E.
Savory, sentinel; \V. B. Greenbe.rg, picket;
J. H. Whiteside, propertyinan,
The officers for the ensuing term will be
installed at the next review. The mem
bership of this tent has increased wonder
fully in the past tew years. In January,
1896, it was 60; in 1897, 69; in 1898, 150. and
on the Ist inst. it had increased to 307.
and "hustlers" and "rustlers" are still
out looking for new members. Much of
the interest in this tent can be traced to
the sides got up by the members to
ascertain which can secure the greatest
number of candidates within a given time,
and as the losing side has to pay for a
banquet there is a great deal of energy
displayed. And the tent has a happy
faculty of making the meetings interest
ing, so that there is always a good at
tendance, for the meeting hall is a good
one in which to spend an evening.
INDEPENDENT RED MEN.
Grand Chief C. Kuss. assisted by Grand
Marshal F. H. Grossmann, installed the
officers of Schiller Stamm No. 278, U. O.
R. M.. in Red Men's Hall on Bush street
last week. The officers Inducted into of

difficulty by switching on an arc light
from the shore, leading the wires to the
mainmast head, and thence into the
hold. By electricity daytime and night
time appear alike, and the work is be
ing rushed regardless of expense, for
every day lost means much money to
a great ship like this. And all because
the cargo of Virginia coal which the
Shenandoah brought from Baltimore
caught fire and came within an ace of
destroying this magnificent vessel.
The Shenandoah is rapidly making
herself famous, even though she is only
eight years old. She has always been
regarded as a magnificent example of
American ship building skill, and until
tin- Roanoake w-as launched by the
same builders, she was the largest
wooden ship afloat. As it is the Roan

tween them is so trifling that it cannot
be discerned by the unskilled eye. Both
ships were constructed by the famous

LADIES OF THE MACCABEES.
During the month of December Mrs.
E. S. Moffatt, State commander of Cali
fornia and deputy supreme commander
; for the Rocky Mountain States, instituted
| five hives, one at each of the following
places: Santa Rosa, with thirty members;
Redding, with forty; Woodland, with
twenty; Auburn, with fourteen; and Ala
meda, witli twenty.
Under tin auspices of the State com
mander there was a class initiation of
twenty candidates at Dunsmuir.
The installation of officers will be made
the feature in February.
The State commander is to make a visit
in the northern part of the State in the
interest of the order.
During the spring- there will he four

FORESTERS OF AMERICA.
Last Monday night John J. Cordy. ajrnnd
I secretary, in company with Jacob Label
of the American Forester Review, visited
Watsonville, where there was a reunion
of Courts Pajaro Valley Rose. Monterey,
Salinas. Santa Cruz. Soledad and Castro
ville. and an installation of the officers
in the hall of the first named court by
c. :â¢:. Peckham, D. D. G. C. R.. assisted
by Past Chief Ranger Green as grand
herald. During the evening a team of
Court St. Lucia exemplified the initiatory
work in a manner that wns most satis
factory, the work being entirely without
ritual. Then- were about 2SS Foresters
present. After the installation and the
work there was a grand banquet, at which
; J. E. Cox presided as toastmaster.
The officers of Court Sotoyome at
Healdsburg were installed last week with
appropriate ceremonies.
The returns that are coming In
show that during the past term the order
has made great gains in this State.
COMPANIONS OF THE F. OF A.
The officers of Bonita Circle were in
stalled by Deputy Mrs. Connell, assisted
I by E. H. Chamberlin as marshal. Ihe
| officers for the term are those who
| served during the previous term, except
I Mrs. I'atton, who becomes left guide; Mrs.
Bridgit, who becomes inside guard, and
Mrs L. Crudden, who becomes outside
1 guard. The entertainment that . was re
i cently given by this circle was a very
j successful affair and was productive of
much enjoyment to all who attended and
filled Mangels Hall. The affair was un
der the direction of E. H. Chamberlin, P.
C c ; Miss Jennie Johnson. Miss Annie

year 1826. The policy consistently pur
sued by the firm during all these years
his been marvelously successful. It
ha? built ships for itself and for no one
elBÂ», and has sailed its own ships over
every sea. thus keeping to itself the
double profits of shipbuilder and ship
owner.
LaAt year when the late war broke
out, the Shenandoah added to her fame
by being the first ship reported cap
tured by the Spanish. It was a rich
prize if the Dons had only got it. for
the caiijo of wheat was afterward sold
in Liverpool for nearly $300,000. For a
few days all San Francisco was in con
sternation over the event, and war
risks went up to an extravagant figure.
But luckily the report turned out to be
only a canard invented by the wheat
jobbers to rig the market.
Captain J. F. Murphy, who was in
command of the vessel at the time, is
now in San Francisco, and laughs mer
rily over tht story. "We never saw a
trace of a Spanish ship." he says. "One
morning tny son told me he saw a cou
ple of torpedo boats, but they might
have been British or French or any
other nationality, for all we knew."
The captain, who is a typical speci
men of the American sailor, polished
and courteous in manner, is himself
one of the largest owners of the Shen
andoah and a member of the firm of
Arthur Sewall & Co. Eight years ago
he superintended the construction of
the vessel and is justifiably proud of
his achievement.
"I have sailed her all over the world,"
he remarked, "and there is not a finer
sailing ship afloat. She is as strong as
an iron vessel and as handy as a yacht.
I have never yet seen the weather
which caused us serious trouble, and
even in the worst of storms she never
leaks at all."
In one sense it was rather unfortu
nate for the Shenandoah that she was
such a tight vessel. Had she leaked
a little the inside qf her bottom would
have been wet and the water-soaked
wood would not have burned. As it
was the timbers were so dry that for
the space of a hundred feet on the port
side, just opposite the main hatch, they
burned right through. Even the out
side planking was nearly destroyed,
and but an inch or so of wood saved
the ship from destruction.
"We could even see the copper nails
which fasten on the sheathing, so you
can imagine what a close shave it was,"
explains Captain Murphy. "Had the
voyage lasted a week longer she must
have been lost."
Few people realize the immense
thickness of a ship built like the Shen
andoah. At the bottom of the hold,
where the fire broke out, the timbers
are of the heaviest possible character.
First there is the ceiling, fourteen
inches in thickness, then the frame
timbers, great pieces of oak eighteen
inches square. Then comes the outside
planking of eight inches, so that alto
gfth'T the fire had to burn through
forty inches of solid timber before the
outside was reached. And If the fire
had once made ever so small a hole iri
the outer planking, the coal would have
commenced to drop out into the fath
omless ocean. The opening thus made
would have rapidly enlarged, the water
would have rushed in, and the vessel
would have foundered.
Probably, had these things happened,
the Shenandoah would have gone to
the mythical port of missing ships, and
the catastrophe would never have been
explained. That such an occurrence
should only have been averted by the
merest chance opens up a startling pos
sibility. Many coal-laden ships have
been posted at Lloyd's as missing, and
they may have suddenly foundered
without any one on board knowing the
cause. It must be remembered that
no one on the Shenandoah had the
slightest idea she was on fire until the
hatches were off and the cargo was be
ing discharged. Then the smoke burst
forth and for days the harbor tugs
poured water into the vessel, until she
came well nigh settling down in the
mud of San Francisco Bay.
Captain Murphy's theory about the
fire is a very simple one. It was
caused, he thinks, by spontaneous com
bustion. Induced by damp and pressure.
As a general rule it is only when coal
Is shipped in a damp condition that
there is much danger of a conflagration
breaking out. But the Shenandoah's
cargo was shipped in a perfectly dry
state, it did not even rain while it was
being taken in at Baltimore. Still all
coal contains a certain percentage of
moisture, and it is likely that the enor
mous superincumbent pressure squeezed
this water to the bottom, where it ac
cumulated in sufficient quantities to
generate heat, which, during the long
voyage through the tropics, became
sufficiently powerful to set the coal
aflame. J. F. ROSE-SOLEY.
Last Wednesday night Grand Chief
Companion Ira W. Coburn. Grand Sub
chief Mrs. Flora Jacobs, Grand Treasurer
Mrs. E. W. Haughy, Past Grand Chiefs
Mrs. M. A. Duke. Mrs. Lizzie Atwood and
Mrs. Emma Harrington, the chief com
panions of Bonita, Excelsior, Diana, Miz
pah and Independence circles, together
with a number of members of the order,
paid an official visit to Inter Nos Circle.
The circle room was beautifully decorated
with evergreen and Christmas berries,
while the American flag was gracefully
festooned over the station of the chief
companion. In the absence of the chief
companion, detained at home by sick
ness. Past Chief Companion Miss Mag
gie Forest presided. There was an ex
emplification of the ritualistic work,
which was commended by the grand chief
companion, after which there were ad
dresses by the visiting officials and the
presentation of a cigar case to the grand
chief companion, and a gold pen and ivory
holder to the subchief companion, and one
to Mrs. Atwood. past grand chief and
deputy of the circle, as tokens of regard
of the members of the circle for the sev
eral officers named. At the close of the
circle those present were the guests of
the committee on entertainment at a col
lation.
INDEPENDENT FORESTERS.
During the past week the principal
events in this order locally have been the
installation of the officers of Courts
Golden Era, Sen Francisco, Noe Valley.
Endeavorer, Precita and Golden Gate by
the board of deputies, which in several

will be by entertainment.
Th- following night the officers of
Courts Mission, Apollo and Madrone will

Hall.
THE JUNIORS.
The ceremonies attending the installa
tion of the officers of Lincoln Council, to
gether with the initiation of four can
didates, was the occasion of an interest
ing session last week. S. J. Theisen, dis
trict depjuty, was the installing officer
There was a good attendance, as special
efforts were made to call out the member

This council will soon be visited by
State Councilor "W. H. Bellinger of Log

The City Council will as usual celebrate
Junior day on the 22d of February by a

"Phroso" and other new plays of more
or less importance. These are all Froh
man attractions. The stock company
will be made up of picked players from
the Frohman companies, and Henry

is considerable that Mr. Frohman will

as the Louis James-Katherine Kldder-
Frederick Ward triumvirate is coming
soon; so is Wilson Barrett's Neronian

and Melbourne MacDowell and Blanche

late Fanny Davenport; and the good

best in several years. Let the rain fall
and the crops grow, and everybody will
have a good time, managers and all.
Clement Scott, the London dramatic
critic, has kept his word and retired
from active work on the Daily Tele
graph. In view of the recent tempest
in this country and in England caused
by Mr. Scott's plain talk about the
morality and immorality of player folk,
and following so soon the announce
ment that Mr. Scott will lecture in
America, this formal farewell of his
will, I think, be of some general in
terest. This is it:
At the close of this, to me. eventful
year of 189* I have been advised by
those whose counsel is to me a law,
and whose affection has been my an
chor in many a storm, to retire per
manently from the active and inces
sant duties of daily journalism. In
these days of pulsating advance, with
theaters starting up as if by magic on
every Pide, in the midst of a world
throbbing with new ideas, startling
theories, old orthodoxies and new
heterodoxies clashing and clanging to
gether, the duties of a dramatic re
viewer to the most influential of all
daily newspapers requires a giant's
strength. The incessant strain of
thirty years' continuous work reminds
me that the best strength, the moat
undaunted courage and the wildest en
thusiasm must have its breaking point.
It is that Inevitable dilemma that I de
sire to anticipate by a rest somewhere
near the last milestone. No one who
has followed me up and down hill will

To sever myself forever from the
passion of a lifetime would be with the
temperament with which I have been
blessed or cursedâ some think one and
some anotherâ an impossibility. When
new authors of brilliant importance,
young actors of dawning promise, and
bright actresses of commanding Intel

near them, believe me, as long as I
live, to help them with my encourage
ment and haply to guide them with
my experience. Like the retired soap

tries in the direct interests of an art
that I have conscientiously studied on
and off for fifty, and incessantly for
thirty, years. Recognizing the many
faults and grave shortcomings of a
long and eventful career, I still yield
to none in my undying love for the
dramatic art and its best gifted pro
fessors, and, in claiming a pardon in
rest, I leave the record of the drama of
the day to the bright lexicon of youth.
This farewell is thoroughly Scott
like, affable and ingenuous, written in
the same old style that for years has
made capital fun for Mr. Scott's Lon
don colleagues and at the same time
endeared him to the great masses,
whose ideal newspaper is realized in
the Daily Telegraph. And, as you can
see, it leaves little to be written in
eulogy of Mr. Scott by other pens. For
thirty years Clement Scott has been
the butt of the clever and the god of
the mob. His notice could make or
break a production in London, I have
been told by managers of experience.
And after an interviewer had lured

Frank Daniels. Ran Francisco's old fa
vorite, will commence a season at the
Columbia Theater Monday night in "The
Idol's Eye." He is a funny little fellow;
his humor is of a magnetic, penetrating
character. It has been a long time since
Daniels was here last, fully five years.
Since then he has emerged from farce
comedy into comic opera.
Both of his operas, "The Idol's Eye"
and "The Wizard of the Nile," have !
been tested in the crucible of New York
and come out approved. According to
the New York Evening Post, that decid
edly hypercritical journal, the two pieces
were "By all odds the comic opera hits of
the season." He will produce them here
with the same cast of principals and
chorus. The two operas are by Harry
B. Smith and Victor Herbert. The scenes
of both are placed in the far East; that
of "The Idol's Eye" in India during the i
present day. that of the "Wizard of the
Nile" in Egypt during the young days of
Cleopatra before, according to the libret
tist, Smith, she knew anything of love.

"The Wedding Day." a comic opera
played for two seasons throughout the

Opera-house beginning Monday evening.
The book is written by Stanislaus Stange;
the music is by Julian Edwards, the com
poser of "Jupiter" and "Brian Boru."
The action of "The Wedding Day" takes
place in Paris and its environs about the

JHE OUTEp WOpbD
A week ago Friday night in Philadel
phia Melba appeared at Mimi in Puccini's
"La Boheme." Both opera and singer
scored successes. The performance was
in Italian. This is what a critic from the
New York Herald says of Melba's work:
"As Mimi she made a charming figure in
her pffeturesque costume, and in both the
comedy and tragedy she was exceedingly
effective, especially for an actress upon
the operatic stage. One does not look for
decided histrionic talents in a prima donna
nowadays, and it was all the more grat
ifying to observe that she had studied
the dramatic as well as the vocal demands
of the opera. Alter the second act tne
recalls were repeated, and on the fall of
the third curtain there was a scene that
might almost be called an ovation. It was
most demonstrative as well as long con
tinued, and confirmed the personal suc
cess she had acnieved earlier in the even
ing."
Cissy Loftus, who is under contract to
appear at Koster & Bial's, New York, has
refused to do so so long as the much dis
cussed tableau "T'n Affaire d'Honneur" is
being shown. She claims through ncr
lawyers that she would not witness it
from the front and certainly will not show
on the same stage with it. Manager
Aarons tersely says: "If sne does not ap
pear here next week I shall see that she
appears nowhere else in America."
Sarasate has two superb Stradivarius in
struments and other violins of different
makes. He has besides in his vest pocket
a miniature case in silver no larger than
a locket in which lies a tiny, tiny violin,
counterpart of his favorite, in real violin
woods and strings, perfectly proportioned,
and which can be taken out and looked at.
He is very fond of this toy. Bpeaking of
the condition of violin art at present, Sar
asate makes the remark: "The subject
speaks for itself. We have neither Paga
nini nor Stradivarius."
Olive May. the actress, yesterday ob
tained a temporary injunction restraining
her former husband. Henry Guy Carle
ton, from making any further contracts
for the performance of his play called
"The Butterflies." Miss May secured a
divorce from Mr. Carleton several months
ago in Dakota on the ground of abandon
ment. She was married to him while she
was playing in "The Butterflies." Mr.
Carleton has more divorces to his credit
than any other living playwriter.
Olga Nethersole ought to be a lucky
woman. She says she has the dramatic
rights to one of Kipling's stories, a new
Filay by Max O'Rell and a promise of one
rom Rostand.
Jobyna Howland has been drawn more
times than any actress on the American
stage, and yet she is a mere girl in years.
The explanation of this is that she served
as the model for Charles Dana Gibson,
and her beauty and grace added much to
the charm of his pictures. Her most fa
mous work was the illustrations for "Ru
pert of Hentzau," in which she is now
playing Flavla in the dramatization.
Stuart Robson recently made a trip
from Boston to New York via Rotterdam
Junction, which any experienced traveler
will recall is not the shortest or most nn-
Joyable trip from there to Gotham. Rob
son arrived at Weehawken tired and
dusty and was awaiting the ferry to take
him 'across, when he was approached by
a ragged member of the Weary Waggles
brigade, whose make-up and appearance
would have shamed any stage tramp ex
tant, and who in a quivering voice said:
"Please, mister, will you be so good as
to give a pnor tramp a nickel? I'm broke
and I want to get across the river." The
comedian .slowly extracted the necessary
coin from his "pocket and placing it in
the hand of the mendicant said: "There
you are, my poor man. but I don't see
what difference it makes which side of
the river you are on, as long as you're
broke."
Morltz Rosenthal, the pianist, tells a
story, which is none the less sarcastically
witty for being purely of his own inven
tion. As the performance of a certain
composition at an orchestral concert In a
large. German city drew to a close, a dis
concerting smell of smoke became notice
able: the conductor, fearing a stampede
if the alarm of fire should become general,
had the quick wit to turn to the audiev.rr
and proclaim In his loudest voice: "La
dies and gentlemen, .the orchestra will
now play the fourth symphony in E minor
by Brahms!" Not a smil darrd to leave his
seat for fear of being thought unmusical.
"Cyrano de Bergerac" was presented
in P'itsburg at the Grand Opera-house
with a vengeance. Advertisements say
the outfit consisted of ten tons of scenery,
sixty-eight actors and two hundred supers
on the stage.
"Caesar and Cleopatra" Is the subject of
Bernard Shaw's latest dramatic work.
Tn five acts and eight scenes, it begins
with the arrival of Caesar in Egypt, in
pursuit of Pompey, after the battle of
Pharsalia. It terminates with his depart
ure, atter six months' stay at Alexandria,
with "The Serpent of Old Nile." The en
tire episode was rejected by Froudo as
mythical, but Mr. Shaw has found more
than sufficient warrant for his view in
Mommsen's copious details of the inci
dent With its successor, already near
ing' completion, and "The Devil's Disci
pline " it will be the third volume of Mr.
Shaw's plays, to be published early in
the spring.
Novelli, the Italian actor, is said to have
put into the mouth of a character in "The
Merchant of Venice" recently in a Paris
theater, to please the anti-Semites, a
proposition that the ships of Antonio
were wrecked by the co-religionists of the
maligned usurer. He also cuts away
ruthlessly those parts of the play which
do not erfve him sufficient prominence. To
compensate for these losses he has added
an entire scene, which will not be found
in any edition of Shakespeare, to give him
full opportunity for the exercise of his
powers.
Belasco's adaptation. "Zaza." produced
by Mrs Leslie farter in Washington,
Christmas night, has made a lasting im
pression there. According to Eastern ad
vices "Zaza" will run "Cyrano de Ber
gerac" a close race for popularity.
An English dramatic critic writes
about playbills: "An old playgoer calls
my attention to a laxity in theater man
agement that has often puzzled me and
has never been explained. 'Why are not
play bills dated?" Dated playbills make
history. Undated playbills lead to lunacy.
After forty years' service in the sup
posed interests of the drama I suppose I
have a goodly collection of playbills, all
preserved in puard hooks in connection
with every theater in 1.-nndon. Not a
tenth of these playbills are dated. I can
not therefore, go to these playbills for
history, but must rummage about my
bunks and the books on stage history be
tween ISSO and ISOS are rare Indeed for
purposes of reference. Where Is our Gen
est? We wanted to make E. L. Hlanchard
our modern Genest, and arranged to ap
point him the stage historian and thus
make him happy for the rest of his life.
But the scheme broke down. Blancnard
died and the story of the stage from
Maeready to Irving has yet to be written
and indexed."
This is written by the indlpnant dra
matic critic of the Cincinnati Enquirer:
"\ crrtaln New York weekly asserts
that the dramatic critic? of the lame and
halting West 'keep carefully a scrapbook
containing the New York reviews of all
kinds and conditions of pieces.' The West
can repudiate the aspersion with ease.
The tons of New Y<>rk "reviews'â God.
save the markâ mailed, carried and
shipped into the West keep thousands of
office cats plump and healthy, raise mil
lions of foot pounds of steam and produce
miles of new paper at the mills. Other
wise New York rovlews are as valuable
to Western dramatic critics as Confed
erate money in a national hank."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 14.â transactions of
the Stock Exchange to-day were the largest for
a tw i hours' session in many years, and had
the me volume contlnut-d for the usuai live
hours" trailing it would have been within a
quarter of a- million of two million shares. Ab
it was there were nearly 700,000 shares dealt
In and the average net rise In prices was from
1 to 2 points in the shares which figured most
extensively In the dealings. There was a di
version of interest from the Pacific* into
higher-priced cks, the Grangers being the
Kulners. The excitement on the floor ot the
ritock Sxcbange was tremendous. There was
an unusually large attendance of brokers for
the short nrsslnrt. as the constant Influx of
outside '.nu-rs rendered it necessary for the
large dealers to transfer considerable of their
business tv the bands of nnaller broken at
the regular commission between members.
Slocks opened buoyant and active. Hign
priced records passed unnoticed in the con
lubion. lirok^rs fought to execute orders and
simultaneous transactions in many shares were
widely apart, London had early received large
]>urchas!nK orders Irom this side and the quo
tations crom that quarter showed genÂ«raj ad
vances. The rapidity of the rise brought out
immense blorks on realizing sales, but the
sustained buying power of the market absorbed
all offerings alter a temporary reaction and
prices again mounted upward. The market
halted momentarily pending the publication of
the weekly bank statement, but on its appear
ance, showing as it did Increases of $4,(32,700
in -the surplus reserve and $3,042,200 in the loan
account, bullish enthusiasm WM resumed with
violence. Commission houses were easily thÂ«
largest buyers. The extreme gains in the Pa
cifies were only fractional, while in the
Grangers they ranged from 1 in St. Paul to â  4
in Burlington, and in the active coalers from
1 to 2'<4. The Gould and Vanderbllt stocks
were comparatively neglected, except Southern
Railway. The greatest strength and activity
was shown In the Grangers, Atehison, the
Reading*. Bouthern preferred, Federal Steel
preferred an.'. Brooklyn Rapid Transit. Points
r.f heaviness were Great Northern preferred.
Illinois Central, Lead and I.aclede Gap. Gen
erally speaking, while there were some sharp
recessions from the extraordinary high open-
Ins, the market regained most of the decline.
The market rinsed with some irregularity, but
generally strong and active, with important
gains In many oases. A noteworthy feature
was a large rise in Burlington on renewed
gossip concerning the prospective refunding of
its outstanding bonds.
This talk, however, was little more definite
than usual. New York Air Brake made an
extreme advance of 9 points, while Southern
Railway preferred and Atehison preferred were

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Jan. 14â The Financier snys:
In the face of a continued demand for funds,
the New York banks are taining cash and
adding to their reserve? in large amounts. It
had been anticipated that the banks would
show a gain as n result of the past six days'
business, but the increase was much larcer
than earlier calculations called for. The
steady gain in specie reflects continued re
ceipts, not only from the West, but from other
points as well. In fart, the gain Is ex
clusively from outside shipments, since pres
ent operations with the Treasury are resulting
In weekly losses to the New York banks. The
expansion in loans, coming after the decrease
of the week ending January 7. Is only logical.
BtOi k dealings are on such an enormous scale
that borrowinx on collateral is resuming the
activity noted during the dose of the year.
It is not probable that the loans represent
sterling operations, as under present circum-
Btaneea liquidation la more in order than ex
pansion. The heavy rai-h receipts, coupled
with the loan increase, are responsible for the
addition of nearly nine millions to the deposit
account, and a.x increased requirements neces
sitated an addition of more than two and a.
quarter millions to that fund, the gain in ex
ceaa cash was only $4,732,700. The surplus re
serve is now ?28.2ti3,07r>. an amount larger than
has beÂ«'n reported since August 20 last, when
Pa we;-,. tK.OOO.OM less and loans nearly
$45,000,000 below present totals. As the move
ment toward New York is likely to Rdd heav
ily to the already idle cash here, it Is only
natural to anticipate an easy money market
for a long time to come, accompanied by con
tinued Stock Kxchange transactions on a
largT scale. Of course, unforeseen cash may
operate to check the activity now bo promi
nent, but events seem to favor indefinite ex
panaion. With money abroad approaching our
own level, gold import talk has subsided. It
is an interesting commentary on present con
ditions to note that the clearing house banks,
while making new records from week to weelc
in clearings and everything else, have yet
more Idle money to take care of than they
themselves like to wee.

CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. Steadiness was imparted
to Wheat here at the start, owing: to Liver
pool quotation* showing yesterday's advance
well maintained. The market, however, soon
felt the effect of the prevailing local bearish
sentiment in the absence of outside buying
, orders to counteract it. Business was very
I dull and individual transactions gave no indi
\ cation of supreme confidence on the other side
of the market. May opened 4c higher at
70% c, but declined to 70% c almost immediately.
About this time New York reported good sized
buying orders from the Continent . for Wheat
and as there was a good deal 01 apprehension
among the crowd as to the condition of winter
Wheat, should severe cold succeed the present
I thaw, prices began to show signs of advanc
ing. Bradstreet's reported the week's exports
of Wheat and Flour at 5,648.000 bushels and
the total shipments to Europe from all export-
Ing countries at 7,200,000 bushels, wnieh would
leave all but about 1,600,000 bushels from this
side. Such evidence of European dependence
upon this country was a great Inducement to '
i holders to raise the price, and May advanced !
1 to 71% c. where it closed.
! In view of the liberal receipts and a further
; heavy market at Liverpool bulls In Corn had
hard work to keep their specialty,! from sag
ging. Puts had been sold yesterday close to
the market and this acted as a sustaining in
fluence. May closed with a loss of %c.
Oats were stead with only small speculative
interest manifested within an extremely nar
row range. May left off a shade lower.
Liberal receipts of hogs and scattered selling
at the start weakened provisions. As the ses
sion progressed, however, active buying by
packers with light offerings started an ad
vance. Pork closed 10c higher and lard and
ribs 24c higher.

THE STOCK MARKET.
There was quite a diversified business in local
securities, as will be seen. The only change
worthy of note was an advance in Alaska
Packers' to $106 C 2%.
Mining stocks stood about the same.
The Silver King Mining Company of Utah
has increased the rate of Its monthly dividend
I from 25 cents to 33% cents per share, or from
$37,500 to $50,000, and one at the latter rate
has Just been declared.
The last monthly report of the Alaska Mrxl
ran mine on Douglas Island, Alaska, shows
that 14.59S tons were crushed and 392 tons
sulphurets treated, the latter yielding $14,349.
The average of the ore and the sulphurets
was $1 97 per ton. The bullion shipment was
$25,740. Gross expenses for the month, $24,192.
The first report of the Alaska United mine
on DouKlas Island, Alaska, Is at hand. This
claim adjoins the Alaska-Mexican and consists
of 2900 feet, being a combination of two prop
erties, each of which has a mill of 100 and 120
stamps respectively. The latter is operated by
the Ready Bullion, which has just made its
first clean up from a run of forty-three days,
! .luring which the mill crushed 19,612 tons of
ore and saved 410 tons sulphurets, the average
value of which is $72 per ton. The mine has
sent down a shipment â¢>f $47,425.

The aunties were making cake of the
sort most likod t â¢ Little Mister. His
keen senses told him all about this, but
he had beer, taught not to ask for any
thing when he went visiting. Alas,
temptation awaits us all: There was a
dish of coffee gelatine placed upon a
table upon the back porch to cool.
Little Mister . .nted to poke liis grimy
little finger : into the sweets â and so
he did. It was hot â had not cooled off

little feet. A sorry sight, indeed. Once

of lions. The king of the lions seized
the Prince by his stout cloak and said:
"What good luck is this! 1 have here
a rich prize to carry home to my mas
ter, the great Gorbozo." Hearing this
the Prince was easy in his mind, for he
know that the lion now would not dare
to hurt him. What would happen next?
"I don't care," said the Prince. "I will
now get closer to the giant and I may
have a chance to surprise him."
The lion trotted down the road to the
gate of the giant's castle, and when he
had reached the gate roared to be let
in. The Prince saw a chance to be
killed by the giant, but his heart was
stnut. In a few minutes he was in the
castle, in the giant's parlor, and Gor
bozo was lnoking at him and laughing.
â Welcome," said the giant in a loud
voice that made the lofty rafters of his
castle shake. "I told you that you
would be good for me to eat. It was
kind of you to save me the trouble of
coming over the river to get you."
The Prince was put in a big dungeon
with a servant of the giant, a frightful
two-headed ogre, to guard him. "Do
you like money?" asked the Prince of
the ogre.
"Have you any with you?"
"No; but I know where there is a
plenty, and if you want it I will show
you where it is after the giant has
gone to sleep."
At midnight, when Gorbozo had be
gun to snore, the ogre let the Prince
out of the dungeon. The two, the Prince
and the ogre, had long-handled shovels.
The Prince pointed out a place where
gold might be found and set the ogre,
â who was the stronger, to digging.
"Are we most down to the gold?"
asked the ogre, after he had dug awhile.
"Yes; keep at work and I will watch
to see that the giant does not come to
take it all away from you after you
have found it."
By this time the ogre was in a pit
fifty feet deep. Before he could get out
of the pit the Prince began to shovel
the dirt back into the pit. It was slid

cause his clothes
were not dry, so
that he could at
once resume his
play in the back
yard, the kitten
tried to comfort
him, and he was
able to stroke her
fur the wrong way
some time before
she became uneasy
and ran r-vay. Then
his clothes were
ready to put on
once more and Lit
tle Mister said:
"Wish you'd trow
away old bowl. I
don't like him any moreâ do I, mam
ma?" Did any boy cv r like the bowl,
filled with water and allied to a towel
to rub roughly over his fine and sensi
tive skin? But now the sun was warm
and Little Mister was on th: ground,
without any one fearing that he would
catch cold. "The sand is clean," said
the aunties encouragingly, "and it will
nil shake off." At which Little Mister
looked unspeakable gratitude â and then
proceeded to get dirty once more as
fast as ever he could. A tray dog
lookd wist full y in under the gate and
would have gladl com *in to play with
the child if he had been invited. Little
Mister corr.-orted the doggie for his loss
by giving him his cookie. The dog
would not go away, but, e-ting his
cookie, lay down close to the gate, eot
ting his head as close to the child as
the fence would let him.
How the happy hours passed, all sun
shine! When luncheon was ready the
Little Mister's eyes
took on a look of
apprehension. Two
baths in <*ne fore
noon had led him
to believe that his
aunts had become so
addicted to immer
sion that he was
sure to be "held
up" in the interest
of cleanliness at
any time and for a
iong period. His
fears were ground
less that time. Only
a brush of the hair
from the fair fore-
head, only a moist
cloth passed over his hands and plump
faceâ and then â such a lot of goodies as
ing sand, and the ogre was covered up
and could not get out of the pit. Only
his head was above the surface. His
howls awoke the giant, who came into
the castle yard in haste to see what
was the matter. At the same instant
the king lion bounded into the court.
The giant was angry at being
awakened, and thinking that the lion
had spoiled his sleep he struck the lion
with a riding whip that he had in his
hand.
The Prince was no more concerned in
this fight than he had been in the bat
tle between the eagle and the serpent.
He ran into the castle, through the
doorway that the giant had left open,
and having bo4ted the door behind him
he jumped into the giant's hu~e bed
and went to sleep. He knew that the
giant would not be able to break down
the castle.
'Let them fight it out while I get
rested," the Prince. "If they
should get into the castle it would be
bad for me, butâ l don't care." So say
ing he went to sleep and did not
awaken until the sun was shining in
through the iron-barred windows of his
room.
Hearing fierce howls in the castle
yard he climbed up to the window by
a rope ladder which he made by tearing
up some of the bedclothes of Gorbozo.
"Let me in," howled the giant at him.
"If you do not I will get some more
giants and tear the castle down."
"If you come in you will kill me,"
answered the Prince. "I shall be no
worse off in the hands of a thousand

So dainty, with such curly hair like yours, cirlie
he had! He was ready to forgive his
aunties now for all the time that they
had caused him to lose from the back
yard; he was even willing to forgive
the soap that had been washed into his
eyes only to be scrubbed out again.
Never were such cakes made for a lit
tle boy before; never was his plate so
piled with luxuries. Whoop! HURRAH!
Coming to aunties is all right after all.
He reflected that it was mamma who
always seems to know when a little boy
is hungryâ who had fixed him for lunch.
Very well all the same â the cakes are
great! And there are so many of them!
And when mamma holds up a warning
finger as Little Mister begins to eat his
third cake, it is auntie who comes to
his rescue after all and says: "The
cakes are plain and I made them for
him; let him have them all this time."
Then Little Mister forgives her com
pletely. Yes, as he toddled away from
the table, once more bound for that
back yardâ was there ever such a back
yard like it any where else in all the
world! Auntie even slyly put a pep
permint candyâ his choicest confection â
in one of his hand? and looked so cute
and lui.ny that Little Mister has to
laugh. Rut his honest mind makes him
go to mamma with it. She, too, laughs
this time and says: "Well, if you are
sick your aunties must come over and
take cii!>' <>f you." Then they all laugh
and Little Mister sings at the top of his
voice as he begins to play.
The children in the next house peep
through the fence to see who is sing
ing such a jolly song. It is about "Sing
a song o' sixpence, pocket full of rye"
and the rest and about the King and
Queen, and "Nipped off a nose."
Wicked blackbird! Lucky bird to be so
snug! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
But alas! There comes a ring at the
THRILLING MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE.
WE, that is, Frank Ruddell and
I, were cruising about in a
naphtha launch three sum
mers ago, during the long va
cation from school. We slept
under the awning which by day kept
off the heat of the sun. The launch
had no cabin. The worst enemy that
we encountered during a fortnight was
the Sacramento River mosquito, who
came from the tules accompanied by
all his blood and blooded relations.
One Saturday night I will long re
member, for then we had an adven
ture which, I think, you will agree was
thrilling. We were well up the river
above Sacramento and had tied up the
launch to the river bank for the night,
according to our custom. By 10 o'clock,
never dreaming of danger, we had both
fallen asleep. Frank slept upon the
seat on one side of the launch and I
slept upon the other. When I awoke
I thought that Frank was lying beside
me. "Get up, Frank!" I shouted, "and
have done with your fooling; this is too
warm a night to be sleeping double."
The answer that I received was a
snarling noise, such as no human oe
fng ever made. I knew the sound well.
It was the voice of a mountain lion.
So. then, my bedfellow was a mountafn
lion, and not a very good natured one
at that. â¢ The moon had risen while we
slept and the Interior of the launch was
fully illuminated by the moonlight. I
was* lying: on the inner edge of the seat
and was facing the other seat, upon
which Frank was. He was awake and
I could see that his eyes were upon me
and also that he could see what sort of
a bedfellow I had.
He had been awakened by nly shout
and the snarling of tfce lion. UnlikÂ»

giants than In your hands. Now I am
going down to breakfast. If you will
get some more giants I don't care.'
When the Prince found the breakfast
room he was surprised at the height
of the table and also at the size of Gor
bozo's favorite chair. He tore up a
napkin, that was as big as the cover
ing of a tent, and threw it over the
chairback and then climbed up into the
chair hand over hand after the fash
ion of sailors. In front of him was a
bell. This he rang, out of bravado,
and before the sound of the bell had
stopped ringing through the house a
giantess, the daughter of Gorbozo,
came into the room. When she saw
Prince I Don't Care she was greatly
surprised, but being full of fun she
came up to the Prince as he sat at the
table and asked humbly what he would
like. "Breakfast, and that very quick
ly!" roared the Prince, striking the ta
ble heavily with his clenched fist.
"Come now; move as if you were used
to waiting upon a gentleman every day
and don't stand there looking at me as-<
If I were a curiosity out of some mu
seum."
"I am Grundalkin, the daughter of
Gorbozo," answered the giantess, "and
I think that I will breakfast after you
are done; that is, I will eat you up
after you have finished eating."
"And you promise me that you will
not eat me until I am through eating?"
"Yes," answered the giantess.
"Very well, then," said the Prince; "if
you keep your word that will be all
right and I will die of old age; for I

to start for home.
Her company stays
some time. The sun
is tired of shining
any more for the
day â just as Little
Mister is almost
tired of playing. He
goes into the house
hoping that his
aunties will urge
him to have some
more cakesâ which
they do, and he
votes inwardly thaj
they â both theca*kes
and the aunties, but
the cakes first â are
too sweet for any
thing as he has often heard his mamma
say â although he has never clearly
made out what she means by that. But,
when the cakes are all eaten. Auntie
brings out a horrid pail full of warm
water and into it he goes, regardless
of his protests, when he Is scrubbed.
Hear his voice raise
in wailing. Was he
ever happy in this
world? Will be ever
be happy more? He
thinks not. The
bath comes to an
end, as do all things
worldly. He feels
very comfortable,
after all. Then he
finds out that he is
tired. Thenâ well
here is his picture
and that shows
what he does at
this stage of the
game. See him
yawn!
many boys, he did not jump up and so
provoke the lion. He had a good head,
as the sequel will -Â»-ove.
"Lie still," he whispered almost in
audibly. "Your lion is a big fellow. I
have my rifle here and after the brute
drops off to sleep again I will" â
Here he was interrupted by the re
newed snarling of the lion, and so his
purpose was. to some extent, a mystery
to me. The silence seemed to pleas*
the lion, which, after lookinsr about a
little, as I judged gave a deep sigh and
then went quietly to sleep, enjoying the
warm place that it had found.
Thinking it over as well as I could
under the circumstances, I was satis,
fled that the lion was no more than a
cub, for a grown lion would not hay&
acted as this brute had. Never mind;
this was enough of a non to make it
very unpleasant, not to say dangerous
for me, if I made a move to quit his
society. Two or three times I tried to
slide from the seat when the heavy
breathing of the lion told me that he
was asleep. The brute stirred uneas
ily, and I took warning and gave up all
idea of trying to help myself. Some
thing dropped unon my shoulder. It
was the head of the mountain lion,
which he had placed there in order that
he might have a more comfortable posi
tion for sleep. Then he was off for a
very long nap.
Frank did not fall asleep during this
slow performance. Neither did he
move until the lion had been sleeping
some time with its head upon my
shoulder. Then Frank reached cau
tiously for his rifle and brought it to
an aim, resting it upon his knees for
steadiness. Do you think that I was
happy just then? To me it seemed that
will never be through eating until I can
eat no more. But hurry now. I want
some fine mountain trout at once and
some bread and some wild honey and
a plenty of the milk of the red goat that
lives in the belfry."
This puzzled the giantess. She found
the trout and the bread and the wild
honey, but she had never heard of a
red goat that lived in a belfry. So the
breakfast was put on the table without
the milk.
"A pretty giantess as ever the sun
shone on you certainly are," said the
Prince, who had some knowledge of hu
man nature; "but I cannot eat my
breakfast until I have the milk."
The giantess wpnt out and found that
some bad boys had driven a goat up
into the belfry and there had painted it
red. She made all haste to get the
milk and when she brought it to the
Prince she laughed aloud. "I have the
milk now and you must eat your break
fast. After breakfast you are mine."
The Prince smiled gayly and said: "I
don't care, Tou said that I could live
until I had finished eating." Then he
took from his girdle his sharp dagger
and cut from the bread a slice so thin
that the giantess could see the light
through it.
"At this rate," said the Prince, "this
loaf of bread will last me a week. You
can run away now and play and I will
call you when I want anything."
The giantess saw that the Prince had
played a trick upon her, but she al
ways kept her word, even if she was a

the muzzle of Frank's rifle was pointed
directly for my head. As a matter of
fact I was in about as ticklish a po
sition as was poor William Tell's son,
when the apple was about to be shot
from his head.
The lion slept on. Frank had made
sure that the rifle was all right before
he aimed. The perspiration was stand
ing on his brow from excitement, but
his hands were steady. All being ready
Frank spoke out aloud:
"Keep perfectly still."
I was as silent as a statueâ but not
WELCOME SURPRISE.
By MINNIE BRADLEY,
SAN FRANCISCO.
THE ground was covered with
snow. We were all going to visit
Grandma on my birthday. This
was in the East. The big sleigh
was in front of the house and
there were two horses hitched to it. We
took the largest sleigh, because we were
going to meet Aunt Ida on the way.
Uncle Phil drove. It was a long way
through the snow to Grandma's. When
we came to her home, a large white
house, we all got out while Uncle Phil
took the horse to the barn. Grandma
was very glad to see us. We had never
been to see Grandma since she had
moved and we were anxious to see the
new house.
We were just inside of the house
when we were met by our eight cousins,
four girls and four boys. First we
went up to the nursery and began to
jilay. Then I wanted to go downstairs
and into the parlor, but I found that
the dnor was locked. I asked why this
was and they told me that Grandma
had a surprise for me and she had kept
the door locked that I might not find

out the surprise too soon. We soon
were called to dinner and I was very
glad. I noticed that Grandma was
smiling and I did not know why then.
She told us to get in Itne and inarch
into the back parlor. Then she threw
ox>en the folding doors and there was
ferocious giantess and made a business
of preying upon people.
She went out, and by this time her
father, aided by several other giants,
had succeeded in breaking open the
huge iron front door and ran into the
castle. He smelled the breakfast and
went to the breakfast room. The Prince
was not there. "Where was he?

Freddie, aged 5, had been watching
his mother preparing the turkey for
dinner and finally said: "Mamma, I'd
rather be a wild turkey than a tame
one." "Why so, dear," she asked. "Be
cause," was the reply, "a wild one can
run around on the prairie all his life
and a tame one gets killed every year."
"No, Willie, dear," said mamma, "no

the brute looked up. His head was
raised a trifle above my shoulder.
Quick as a flash Frank fired. The bul

It stiffened out after a brief struggle,
in which its claws were used to tear
up my hunting suft
"Hurrah for William Tell." shouted
I, leaping up and rushing over to shake
Frank's outstretched hand.
The lion was a cub, but quite a large
one. Frank has the skin and I have
kept the claws for a memento
a beautiful tree, ju3t like a Christmas
tree, and it was full of lovely presents.
I got a gold ring, a writing desk and
many other things, and the baby had
a rubber doll and a rocking horse, a

nice time playing games after dinner.
We stayed at Grandma's all night and
had a lovely sleigh ride home the next
morning. That was the nicest birthday
that I ever had.

RED CROSS
WORK IN CUBA
Continued From Page Seventeen.
the Red Cross as a godsend. The Cu
ban hospital was better furnished with
beds and bedding and other appliances
than the one they had just left. It
had been a regular army hospital un
der the Spaniards, and on their quick
retreat they had left nearly everything
intact. So these patients were in a
much better condition. But "better
is only a relative term.
The place was foul to the eyes and
to the nostrils. The surgeons in charge
begged that the ladles of the Red Cross
should wait a day until the place had
been thoroughly cleaned. Red Cross
nurses, however, are trained in a school
that makes the annihilation of dirt its
first principle.
So, early the following morning, they
appeared with pails, scrubbing brushes,
soap, whitewash and disinfectants, and
the way in which they went to work
elicited the admiration and astonish
ment of all who saw them. Before
nightfall the patients had been care
fully bathed, put into clean clothing
and then into clean, sweet smelling
beds, which, like all the rest of the
furniture, and even the walls and the
floors, had been thoroughly washed and
disinfected.
New Clamors From the Men.
And now the transformed Cuban hos
pital presented such a notable contrast
of peace, cleanliness and comfort to the
squalor, negligence and suffering In the
United States hospital that loud
clamors arose among the American sol
diers.
"What kind of people," they cried,
"are these Red Cross folk, that come
down here and give the best of every
thing to the Cubans and pass by our
boys, who are dying for the want of
these very attentions?"
The clamors were only Intensified as
they were turned to other quarters by
the explanations of the Red Cross peo
ple that they had first gone to the
United States army surgeons with prof
fers of assistance, which had been
unanimously declined.
"Why?" was f.e inquiry that arose
everywhere.
No satisfactory answer was forth
coming. The clamors grew in force
and volume until in a day or two the
army surgeons deemed it best to allay
further irritation by a general accept
ance of whatever was needed in the
way of Red Cross stores or personal
assistance from its representatives.
As a result the American hospital
was soon made as comfortable as the
Cuban. From that time on to the end
of the war the army surgeons and the
Red Cross worked in perfect harmony
and with mutual respect and admira
tion. A Red Cross hospital was opened
at Slboney and immedlatel. filled to
its utmost capacity with American sol
diers and Government employes. Red
Cross surgeons were given operating
tables in the army hospital and on the
field and with the aid of the Red Cross
nurses rendered incalculable service in
the bloody days that soon followed.
As General Shafter pressed forward
with his troops and the fighting became
more severe, and his chief surgeon. Col
onel Pope, appealed to Miss Barton for
aid to be sent out to the front, she
responded by immediately leading a
party in person, which went forward
in army wagons and on foot, over an
execrably bad road. They soon had
their tents up and their kettles boiling,
and for several days they devoted all
their time to relieving the sufferings
of the wounded on the field. They
found many of the poor fellows lying
on the field, where they had been left
after their wounds had been dressed.

rainy season had now set in.
Exodus of Non -Combatants.
During the siege of Santiago General
Shafter sent word to General Toral. the
Spanish commander, that unless the
city was surrendered within 24
hours he would bombard it. The sur
render was refused. An exodus of non
combatants of all ages and both sexes,
to the number of 30,000 or more, hur
riedly took place. Some 20.000 took
refuge in El Caney. This vast horde
of hungry wretches overwhelmed the
little village, whose normal population
was barely 500. At a word from Gen
eral Shafter Miss Barton sent thither
Mr. Elwell to form a citizens" commit
tee for the purpose of distributing the
food that was to follow as quickly as
transportation could be secured. Every
horse, mule and vehicle that could be
borrowed, begged or hired was pressed
into service, and for two weeks the Red
Cross agents worked night and day in
relieving the place. An elderly gentle
man from Brooklyn, C. C. Bangs, was
given charge of the relief supplies, and
he worked faithfully as cook and dis
penser from sixteen to eighteen hours
a day, until the surrender of Santiago,
when the city people returned to their
homes. But the strain proved too much
for him. He came to the Red Cross
headquarters, which had meanwhile
been established at Santiago, sick and
broken, to fall a victim to calentura.
He was buried in the cemetery at San
tiago.
Red Cross at Santiago.
It had taken five days of hard and
steady work for the Texas to discharge
her cargo at the surrendered city. She
then left on her return trip to New
York, leaving the Red cross after that
without any efficient means of trans
portation, as the railroads had been
broken, and there were none but gov
ernment ships in the harbor.
The Government had few delicacies
at its disposal for its sick men. These
were so hard to get at, owing to the
official red tape, that those in quest of
them could not get their orders filled
until their patients had died or recov
ered. Consequently it was only nat
ural they should flock to the Red Cross,
where it was only necessary to state
the need and to write a requisition in
order to obtain whatever was In stock.
Official Red Tape.
"There was at both Siboney and San
tiago a great congestion of Government
steamers, causing much confusion and
consequent delay in getting commis
sary and quartermaster stores ashore.
The Government, of course, had charsre
of everything, including wharves and
lighters, and as we were unable to com
mand these facilities several shipments
of goods sent to the Red Cross at Santi
ago were never allowed to land and
were returned to the United States."
DESERTED HIS WIFE.
David J. Thomas, a furniture dealer at
14 McAllister street, appeared in Judge
Graham's court yesterday to answer a
charge of deserting his wife and associat
ing with another woman, Mrs. Viola B.
Perry. The case was continued till to
morrow morning.
Thomas and his wife were married
about five years ago, and lived in a house
on Liberty street, which they purchased
on the installment plan. They lived hap
pily together until about six months ago,
when Thomas began to absent himself
from dinner. Then he became bolder and
stayed away nights. Mrs. Thomas be
came suspicious, and finally she discov
ered him with Mrs. Perry lunching In a
restaurant near the City Hall. His wife
upbraided him for his conduct, and he
frankly told her he had intended going
with Mrs. Perry until he was found out.
Shortly afterward he left his wife alto
gether and went to live at the house of
Mrs. Perry, 528 Golden Gate avenue,
where he was arrested on Friday night.
Mrs. Thomas has been living with her
Bister, and through her attorney, Joseph
Coffey, she instituted suit in Judge Hunt's
court for alimony, and the suit is now
pending. ShÂ« is only 23 years of age and

FILIPINOS
AS CITIZENS
Continued From PagÂ© Twenty-One.
lie office as among the rulers of free
America.
Annexation will possibly have the pe
culiar effect of changing family names
in the Philippines. As a paterfamilias,
the Filipino has no superior, here or
elsewhere; for nowhere, I verily be
lieve, is there more family affection
than among the natives of my country,
but the mother is really the head of the
home; her word is law and she gives
the surname to her offspring, who hold
her in peculiar awe. However, the
elastic nature of the Filipinos will
easily adjust itself to new conditions,
and will retain its inherent virtue.
I do not believe, as some of my coun
trymen do, that the Filipino will dis
appear before the incoming tide of
American emigration, as did the Amer
ican Indian. There are good reasons
for this belief. One is, we are of the
tropics tropical, and not even a hun
dred generations could completely ac
climatize the American, nor adapt him
to the conditions of this sultry zone.
There is no more danger that we will
be supplanted by the Americans than
that the Dutch will supplant the Ma
lays in Java. The body of the popula
tion must ever be native-born and in
that physiological necessity and eth
nological fact lies our national salva
tion. Therefore, even in the event of
American annexation, the Filipinos will
in the main rule themselves; nor can
any one else do it so well.
The Filipinos are by nature agricul
turists. The farm suits them better
than the store or factory. The ChineÃe
and the foreigners, indeed, almost
monopolize the trade of the islands; the
natives being in the main producers,
or else in the professions. And right
here will come the great opportunity
for American commerce; for the carry
ing trade of the islands, as well as the
various kinds of manufacture will soon
be in American hands, and the chances
for large profit will soon draw many
investors to those golden shores.
The hemp, tobacco, sugar, lumber, in
digo, rice and cocoa industries will thus
alone receive a magnificent impetus
and the production of these articles of
export will be stimulated, so that with
in five years their yield will be in
creased threefold. Hitherto there was
little incentive to work hard for one
self, since the profits were shorn for
the benefit of the oppressor. Woe to
the Filipino who prospered; he was
fleeced in a thousand ways by the of
ficials of the state and of the church.
Thus ambition was atrophied and en
terprise of every sort was dwarfed into
apathy. Foreign investors also were
similarly encouraged, and many were
only allowed to leave the scene of their
unprofitable investment after they had
lost their last dollar.
Millions of acres of arable land are
yet untilled. They wait an era of de
mand to Impel them to frultfulness;
and America will create that demand
by an increasing commerce, that will
redound to her double advantage. For,
in exchange for the products of the is.
lands, she will give the thousand and
one articles of civilization manufac
tured in America. Send us prayer books
and missionaries for our rice and hemp
if you wish; but keep out American
liquors and American politics. No one
can drink the strong beverages of the
temperate zone in the Philippines and
live. Many foreigners, it is true, in
] sist upon their arrival in Manila on
calling for whiskies and brandies; but
such indulgence is sure, even if con
tinued only moderately, to superinduce
a fatal fever, or some other tropical dis
ease. Many of the foreigners who
have died there owed their deaths to
the daily tipple alone. For this reason
the climate has not been so dangerous
to the natives of wine drinking coun
tries, like France and Ital^. American
troops should be cautioned In. regard

to this insidious danger, and strong
liquors, both for your sake and ours,
should be kept out of the colony.
Protestantism will not flourish in the
Philippines. The pomp and ceremonial
of the Catholic church appeals most
strongly to the native imagination, and
no religion which is wanting in splen
dor and in grand music will find a foot
hold in the Islands. There is thus lit
tle danger of the Filipinos ever becom
ing Quakers. They are a very musical
people. Every village has its native
orchestra, and in the processions, of
which the natives are so fond, and
which occur every few days, the music
is the chief feature. Indeed, it may
be said that every Filipino plays some
instrument, and even little children
five or six years of age play the piano
or guitar amazingly well. It is refresh
ing to go through the suburbs of Ma
nila on a fine summer's eve and to hear
the happy people on the wide verandas
of their homes singing and playing pop*
ular airs, which the passersby below
will take up, so that the whole street
resounds with melody. Music is truly
a great civilizer, and it has doubtless
been a powerful instrument in the
hands of the church to win the natives
to the standard of the cross.
Strange to say, the Filipinos, not
withstanding their great love for mu
sic and their wonderful ingenuity in in
venting and constructing musical in
struments, have no distinct school of
their own, preferring to play the com
positions of European composers than
to take the trouble to write their own.
I believe, however, that they are capa
ble of a high order of composition, for
one of the gifted Luna brothers, whom
I knew very well, composed some pieces
of extraordinary meritâ and I am sure
others also have the genius to do so.
I believe that large estates should be
prohibited by law, for I fear that a
few Bchemlng Americans may soon own
the greater part of the Islands, and will
therefore soon have a great part of the
population .on their estates, educating
them for a future of dependence and
for political subserviency. At present
every native owns his own house and
his own little patch of land, and Is con
tented and happy. Let him continue
undisturbed in his humble possessions.
The chief necessity of the islands are
good schools, and we hope that the
Americans will not long withhold from
us this long desired feoon. Compara
tively few natives have had the ad
vantage of modern methods. At pres
ent the educational facilities are most
meager and the methods of the native
schoolmasters, as well as of the Span
ish priests, are most antiquated. Only
Spanish books have as a rule been al
lowed, and the whole course of colonial
education has had a theological bias.
The groundwork of superstition, how
ever â reared with such infinite labor
during the centuries of Spanish priest
craftâis fast giving way. The eyes of
the natives have at last been opened.
They will no longer tolerate the delu
sions of the past, but will eagerly em
brace the doctrines of the new. Under
American dominion, a glorious future
awaits the Filipino. He will for once
be able to hew out of the rock of op
portunity the statue of his own worth.
RAMON REYES LALA.
A FORGER RELEASED.
Al Alford, Dying of Consumption, Is
Allowed to Go Home to Texas.
Al Alford. alias Allen, secured his lib
erty from Judge Graham yesterday, and
he promised to go to his home In Texas
and end his days there. He Is dying
of consumption.
Alford was arrested about two months
ago as he was leaving San Quentln after
serving a term for forgery in Los An
geles, and booked at the City Prison on
a charge of forgery committed hero prior
to the Los Angeles offense. He waa ac
cused of forging the name of A. Allen
of Philadelphia to a draft which he
cashed at the First National Bank.
Yesterday Attorney Caldwell, for the
defendant, raised the point that the pros
ecution had failed to show that Allen had
not authorized the defendant to sign hi*

The Judge held that the point was well
taken and dismissed the case.
Alford has in the past given the Bank
ers" Association considerable trouble, and
the Pinkerton agency has other cases
against him. Attorney Ach, represent
ing the Bankers' Association, offered no
objection to Alford's discharge from cus
tody, considering his condition, and said
he would not molest him as long as ha
remained at his home. His relatives are
among the leading families in Texas.
Whipped a Gripman.
A warrant was sworn out in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday for the arrest of
Jack Sullivan, a hackman, on a charge of
battery. The complaining witness is A.
R. Wood, a gripman on the California
street line. Friday afternoon, at Califor
nia .street and Van Ness avenue, Sullivan
attempted to cross the track in front of
Wood's car, but Wood kept on. Sullivan
got mad, and used his whip freely on
Wood's face and shoulders, blackening
both his eyes.
R. J. Tobin Much Improved.
Word was received at police headquar
ters yesterday that Police Commissioner
Tobin's condition was very much im

collapse had passed. The news afforded
much gratification.
