FILIPINOS LOST THOUSANDS
MANILA, Feb. 6.â Careful estimates place the Filipino losses up to
date at 2000 dead, 3500 wounded and 5000 taken prisoners.
MANILA, Feb. One of
the most notable events of Sun
day's battle was driving the Fili
pinos out of their stronghold at j
Paco by the reserve, a few com- j
panics of Californians, com- J
manded by Lieutenant Colonel j
Duboce. The main road to the i
village was lined by native huts
full of Filipino sharpshooters. '
After they had fired upon Gen- j
eral King and his staff, killing
.a driver, and had fired on an !
ambulance of the Red Cross
Society, Colonel James F.
Smith .red the huts to
be cleared and burned. The
Filipinos concentrated in Paco
church and convent, where they
made a determined stand in the
upper stories. A platoon of Cali
fornians, stationed on a neigh
boring bridge, maintained a hot
fire on the Filipinos, but was un
able to dislodge them.

ly possible to describe the effect' upon
the, natives in the city of Manila of the
disastrous result to > the : Filipinos fol

Americans on Saturday, night. It is ap

Of-* course this idea was due to the
ignorance of the natives, but* it. is .this
very ignorance which .will;*', for some
time to come, ,be a dangerous factor in
the situation here. The .Filipinos in the
city were evidently l buoyed *up by the
hope "that I when the : invaders '' began to
retreat they would have . an opportu

On "Sunday afternoon, when .they

In addition to such a vigorous policy
. against the insurgents, the President is
actuated by a desire to bring to an
end with all dispatch the rebellious
' .movement which Aguinaldo has inaug

â was determined upon, as stated in the

' conference at the White House last
night and a further conference at the
Executive Mansion which was partici

tives were not lacking in courage, but
no courage COUld have withstood the
terrible rain of death that fell upon
the Filipinos as the gallant Americans
approached their positions.
When the enemy retreated, after a
stubborn resistance, it was in utter
rout, and the only desire seemed, to
have been to get out of the range of the
American guns as rapidly as possible.
A conservative estimate of the enemy's
losses places the number at 4000 killed
PRIVATE THOMAS T. BRYAN,
Company H. First California, who was killed at Manila while bravely fight
ing to maintain the honor of the flag which he went to the front to defend,
was a native of this city. He was a son of Mrs. Margaret Bryan of 2.".l!H''all
fornia street, and was 34 years of age and unmarried. When the President
issued his call for volunteers Bryan was among -the first to of
fer his services. He always said that he wanted to see active
service. Even In his recent /letters home, while he expressed
happiness that he was soon to return to San Francisco, he regretted that
he had not been in a fight, as he wanted to have the experience of being
under fire. Bryan was never engaged in business, having an income of his
own; he, however, looked after his mother's estate. Besides his mother he
leaves two brothers and a sister. The latter is a Mrs. Weed of this city.
One of his brothers is the proprietor of the Arlington Hotel at Suisun.
while the other, John J. Bryan, is a resident of San Francisco. IlpSiil
dent that as soon as Aguinaldo learns
of the ratification of the treaty he
will appreciate the futility of the con
flict with the United States and will be
willing to make terms of surrender. It
is assumed that Agoncilio, who is in
Montreal, has taken measures to inform
Aguinaldo of the action of the Senate,
but Otis will be ahead of him and will
send the information into the insurgent
lines without delay, but Secretary
Long, for the information of Dewey,
cabled to that official:
"Treaty ratified."
It is possible, of course, that Aguin
aldo may continue fighting, in which
event he will be shown no quarter, but
will be relentlessly pursued until he is
â¢ forced to surrender. The President does
not propose to show any vacillation in
this matter. The policy to be put into
effect is the same as that adopted im
mediately upon the outbreak of the
war with Spain to concentrate every
effort to break down the power of the
enemy in the quickest possible time.
No apprehension is felt as to the re
sult of the attack on Iloilo. Miller has
at his disposal a force of about 3000
men. and he will be aided in his oper
ations against Iloilo by the cruisers
Baltimore and Boston and the gun
boats Petrel and Concord. There are
said to be about 10,000 natives defend
ing the town, but they are badly armed
and it is not believed that any great
difficulty will be experienced in driving
them out of town.
I was informed to-night that Otis
will continue his operations under the
terms of the President's proclamation
issued some weeks ago. Protection will
be afforded to all peaceful inhabitants
in the islands, and harsh means will be
adopted toward those breaking the
peace and defying the authority of the
United States. As to the future policy
of the administration in the ' Philippines
I understand that the President has de
termined to take no action until the
report of the Schurman commission is
received.
and wounded. The killed far outnumber
the wounded, many of* the latter being
cared for by our army as prisoners of
war.
It is incomprehensible to any intelli
gent observer here on the ground why
Aguinaldo could have been so stupid
as to expect to catch the Americans
napping. For some time past, as dis
patches to The Call have indicated, the
authorities have been expecting just
some such treacherous move as was
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7. 1899.
A picture of SANTA MESA, three miles east of Manila, near which the first Filipino attach was made on the American
lines. In the distance are seen trje San Juan Mountains, at the foot of wtycb is tl)e town of Sao Jesus del Monte, near

made Saturday, and every precaution !
was taken to guard against the con
tingency.
The plot of the natives was carried j
out with secrecy, but Otis had enough |
information of the plans to enable him
to block any move they might attempt '
against our forces. It was not known
from what direction the blow would
be dealt, and consequently .measures
were adopted to make secure each and !
every part of the American lines. These j
measures were carried out in such a j
quiet and unostentatious manner that i
Aguinaldo's spies, of - whom he had '
many within the American lines, were
completely deceived as to the real
strength of the American positions, and
reports to the chief led him to make
the most serious mistake of his life.
The enemy was totally unprepared i
for the vigorous punishment adminis
tered to them. The moral effect of the i
drubbing given to them will be great. i
The Filipinos apparently thought they j
could massacre the Americans in the â 
night attack as easily and frequently j
as they did the Spanish troops sent ,
against them. The difference resulted !
in thousands of them losing their lives ;
in a hopeless cause.
Aguinaldo, so far as can be learned,
! did not risk his precious skin with his
troops, and is still hale and willing to
make further trouble.
The first reports of the fighting were i
to the effect that few of the Americans j
had been killed, but when the official ;
report began to come in it was found
that over forty of our men had lost
their lives, while the wounded num
bered 150. These reports are not yet
complete. It is known, however, that
the Fourteenth (regular) Infantry, the
old command of Brigadier General J.
M. Anderson, from Vancouver Bar
racks, suffered the greatest losses. The
regiment was quartered at Malate, and
was under' command of Major Robe.
It was assigned the task of carrying !
the rebel position south of that suburb, i
and the fight was through a country
with a dense undergrowth that made
progress "slow at first.
The natives took refuge in huts and
until they were dislodged " and while
being driven back inflicted considera
ble damage on our men. The Four
teenth is armed with Krag-Jorgensen
rifles, and these weapons proved most
effective. For every life that -gallant
old regiment gave up it took a score in
revenge. y,'./-v\
The First "Washington Volunteers
and "Third Regular Artillery also saw
severe fighting and sustained material
losses. -y '->;, v i. .
The Utah Light Artillery, seasoned
by experience at Malate in August, and
the Sixth Regular Artillery did splen
didly effective work, and the latter
probably saved the First California
Regiment and the First Colorado from
being badly cut up. The guns of the
Utah Battery were posted east of the
city, and during the early hours of
Sunday poured a deadly fire into the
insurgent trenches.
The First California Regiment was
attacked by th* Filipinos, who were
concealed in huts beside the road along
which the Americans were advancing:.
To put an end to the" danger from this
quarter. Colonel Smith gave orders to
burn the village, which was soon done.
In the district between Tondo and
Malabon to the north of the city, great
slaughter was done by the gunboat
Callao, Lieutenant Benjamin Tappan
commanding, which Admiral Dewey
captured from the Spaniards. This lit
' tie vessel is certainly a terror. She
mounts more guns, proportionately,
than any other vessel in the American
navy, being full of one, two and three
pounders and machine guns. She dup
licated her performance of August 13.
when she covered General Â Merritt'
advance on Manila. Then she steamed
close to the breakers and moved along
the shore as the troops advanced/pour
ing a deadly fire into the Spaniards.
Yesterday she again ran close to the
beach, and, getting the range of the en
emy, began to spit fire from her bow
guns. Then, maneuvering, she brought
her starboard battery to bear, and the
rattle and din were terrific. Soon. she
came about and brought her port bat
tery into action, and these maneuvers
were repeated until she was ordered to
cease firing.
The Concord's' six-inch and the
Charleston's eight-inch guns did awful
execution. Brigadier-General Otis' bri- j
gade had driven a. large body of ; the j
enemy from their positions, and the |
Filipinos ran at top speed for ' the i
beach, a disorganized and panic-strick- I
en mob. When they reached the shore j
they were mot by the devastating fire :
of the warships, and were mowed down ;
score upon 'score, until the sands ap- j

peared to be completely drenched with
blood. The sight was simply sickening,
with the dead and dying torn to pieces
and terribly mangled and bleeding na
tives lying all about. On Sunday
afternoon the Charleston joined the
monitor Monadnock off Malate. which
was the scene of the heaviest fighting
with the Spaniards in August, and both
vessels delivered their shells with tell
ing effect. The enemy were retiring
: before the steady advance of the Four
teenth Infantry, and had comparatively
little shelter. They furnished excellent
targets for marksmanship .of s the
Yankee gunners, whose reputation suf
fered nothing from the engagement.
The Olympla. Admiral Dewey's flag
ship, took no part in the bombardment.
With the fine strategy, for which the
American naval commander is noted, he
placed the vessel in a position directly
I in front of the city, between the Spanish
gunboat General Alava and the German
; cruiser Irene and the troops ashore.
! The significance of this move will be
readily grasped. This was a fight be
tween the Americans and Filipinos, and
no outsiders could be permitted to en
ter the ring, so Admiral Dewey con
stituted himself a sort of referee to say
"hands off" if it became necessary.
The captured Spanish gunboat Lagu
na de Bay did good work for her new
owners. She is a light draught vessel
and has proved most serviceable on
more than one occasion since the Amer
icans have had her. Sunday she went
up the Pasig River and fairly riddled
the village of Santa Ana with gatling
guns, tearing the huts to pieces, kill
ing many rebels and driving others to
seek a new shelter. The . good result
of the firing was seen this morning,
when nearly all the native huts on' the
outskirts of the city, j that j were left
standing were flying white flags to
prevent attack by the Americans.
The Filipinos have not yet stopped
retreating. The Americans are still. in
pursuit of them, determined to give
them a lesson they will never, forget.
Our troops north of the city are now
nearly to Caloocan on the Daguayahan
railway. This place fairly bristles with
fortifications, and is the strongest po
sition of the rebels. To the south the
Americans are at Pasay, which is south
of Malate.
PEDRO J, PATERNO, President of the Filipino Congress,
Aguinaldo's disheartened soldiers
opened lire along the northern lines east
and west of Caloocan early this (Mon
day) mornirtg, but it was mostly at long
range and lacked the dignity of an at
tack. There was a spirited reply and
after a few sharp rallies the enemy fell
back and the firing died away.
The general line was not engaged,
and there were no serious casualties.
The burial of the dead Filipinos by
our soldiers began this morning. In
one place 180 bodies were found and in
another 60. Nearly every American
regiment engaged has reported the
finding of 50 or more of the enemy dead
along its front.
General Hughes' pr%vost brigade,
which is composed of the Minnesota
volunteers and men from the Twenty
third Infantry, are doing excellent
work in the city in keeping the natives
in subjection.
The First Tennessee Infantry has
been divided, one battalion reinforcing
General Anderson and two battalions
joining General McArthur's command.
The troops are now on the way to seize
the waterworks, which are situated five
miles north of the city.
The number of American troops en
gaged Sunday /was 13,000, while the
Filipinos' forces numbered 20,000.
The Americans while the fighting was
going on were disposed of in the fol
lowing manner from the bay on the
north around the city to the bay on the
south: .-.-'â¢
Twentieth Kansas Infantry, Third
Artillery, First Montana Infantry and

MONTREAL, Feb. 6.â Agoncilio has
had an extremely busy day of it.
Newspapermen and people drawn by
curiosity have thronged his room all
day long, and the Filipino envoy has
been kept busy answering questions
ever since he finished his breakfast this
morning. The interviews in the even
ing papers amused him greatly.
"They have come here and asked me
all sorts of questions," he said to-night, j
"and then they have gone away and
printed what they liked, or what they I
thoughts I said." .'â " '
Agoncilio was shown the Associated
Press dispatches concerning the ratifi
cation of the peace treaty. He read \
them with interest. The final vote in
terested him in particular.
"That is. not a very big majority, is
it?" he said. But when pressed to ex- |
press an opinion < n the Senate's action
he declined.
"I cannot say anything just now. I
am not yet aware of the circumstances.
I really cannot say anything about the
matter until I have had an opportunity
to fully. consider the situation. .Neither
can I say anything about my future !
movements. They are dependent en- !
tirely upon circumstances."
Then Agoncilio began asking ques
tions about the Canadian constitution.
He has asked a good many of a similar
nature to-day. He inquired of all his
visitors as to whether they prefer to
have Canada a colony or not.
â¢ "You have not got freedom," he de
clared, "and* you don't want it. You
are not like us."
The Filipino representative appar
ently does not recognize the action of
the Senate to-day as a negative reply
to his , mission. He has not yet the
news hÂ« nrnfessed to have come to Can-
Ada to get, but he hopes to have it
soon.

Â§ Cupid is us-

sick men and

best for the human race that they should
not. It is not a hard matter for men and
women to preserve their health if they
wish: It is far from impossible for them
to restore it after it has been lost. That
being the case, the modern Cupid is right
in looking with disfavor upon matrimonial I
matches between sick men and unhealthy
women. 111-health in a woman is generally
the result of some weakness or disorder of
the distinctly feminine organism that .is
slowly sapping her vitality. At first a
little pain and slight indispositions which
seem to her quite unimportant. They grow
steadily worse until she suffers all the time
from burning and dragging sensations, and
occasionally has to take to he** bed. Fin-
ally they completely unfit her for wifehood
and motherhood. Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription is an unfailing remedy for ail-

â : chamber declaring that the treaty had
7 been ratified. Some made the mistake
,*: of stating that there were three votes
"â to spare.

â¢ . .No vote has been taken in the Senate
.since that of the repeal of the purchas
ing clause of the Sherman law that has
' been, followed with as close interest
! as was the vote of to-day. This anx
-7 I.ety was due not only to the magni-
I tilde of the question at issue, but to
â  -."the uncertainty which attended the
* matter up to the last moment. Only
. :the select few knew how Senators Mc-
Enery of Louisiana and Senator Jones
: of Nevada would vote half an hour
before their votes were cast, and not
â¢even these knew when the bells rang
-..for- the executive session at a quarter
. past 2 o'clock.
Many of the vast throng which was
* turned from the galleries after the
.doors were closed in response to Sen
-7.7a.t0r Davis' motion lingered in the cor
'.ridors, all waiting eagerly for the first
news from inside. It was generally un
.. derstood that the first forty-five min
= utes was to be given to speech mak
ing, but the crowd apparently was pre
pared for this delay.
.Within the chamber the interest was
.. even more intense. Very few Senators
, left the chamber, except those engaged
in the cloak rooms in trying on the one
side to gain votes for the treaty and
the other to prevent a break in the
ranks. Senators Aldrich. Lodge and
Elkins, who have given their especial
attention to securing the necessary
votes to insure ratification, were doubt
i.i ful of the result when the secret session
began, while Senators Gorman and
â¢Jones, the leaders of the opposition,
.'considered their forces intact. Half an
â  : hour afterward it was whispered about
â¢7 that Senator McEnery had been won
. over on condition that his declaratory
;â¢*. resolution should be adopted subse
quent to the passage of the ratification
â¢'â¢resolution. When this news was con
,'firmed it was known that ratification
' was assured, for Senator McLaurin had
. already announced his intention to vote
'for the treaty in view of the condition
of affairs at Manila. Senator Jones
..'wept over at the last moment, making
the one. vote more than was necessary.
7 There was no applause when the result
was announced, but many Senators
heaved a sigh of relief, and rushed from
tin- chamber to give the news to the
waiting world.
'â ;':â  :-..'â  In advance of the voting speeches
?t were made by Senators Ross, Money
"-. and Fairbanks. Senator Stewart, who
7}. _ just arrived from his successful
campaign in Nevada for re-election, an
.: nounced informally during this period
of the session that in his entire trip
across the continent he had not encoun
-7 terfed one man who was opposed to the
' -s-tiflcaticra of the treaty.
.'â  Senator Ross read a brief written
' Speech announcing his Intention to sup
*. port the treaty as in the interest of
peace. He entered somewhat into the
legal questions involved, saying that he
saw no obstacle in the way of ratifica
tion from that source.
: Senator Money reiterated his opposi
tion to the treaty and made a last plea
for a modification of the agreement.
He asserted that if the friends of the
treay had agreed to a modifying reso
lution the vote could have been secured
much* sooner and as it would have car
lied assurance of pacific intentions on
the part of this Government it would
have prevented the hostile conflict at
Manila. â¢â¢â -.â¢- â¢ , , . Â_
Senator Teller here interrupted the
Mississippi Senator and there was quite
a lively exchange of words. Teller an
nounced his belief that the opposition
to the treaty was responsible for the
Manila battle and Money declared this
view to be absurd. 7.V> 7 7
' Fairbanks spoke at some length, his
speech being the first he had made
since the debate began. He made an
appeal for unanimity of action, in or
k der that the country might present a
\ harmonious front to the outside world
iv dealing with So important a question.
He said that no partisan political ad
vantage could possibly be claimed by
any one in the ratification, and held out
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
the view that solid support of the ad
ministration would be of vast advant
age to the administration in the pres
ent crisis. In this connection he re
ferred to the opening of hostilities at
Manila and expressed the view that the
ratification of the treaty would do
much to prevent further bloodshed and
restore quiet.
"Let us," said he, "ratify the treaty
and then settle our differences concern
ing- the question of expansion after
ward. Those questions can wait, but
the emergency is too great for any
postponement whatever on the ratifi
cation question."
Promptly at 3 o'clock the Vice Presi
dent interrupted Senator Money, who
was then speaking, to announce that
the hour had arrived for a vote.
But one amendment was offeredâ
that proposed by Senator Vest, plac
ing the Philippines on the same foot
ing as Cuba in this treaty. In the tem
porary absence of Vest it was pre
sented by Gorman. This amendment
was as follows:
Article lir-Strike out the Wds,
Cedes to the Lnited States," and insert
in lieu thereof the words, "Relinquishes
all claim of sovereignty over and title
, n t dd *^rV he ?" d of artlcl e 111 the follow
ing. The Lnited States desiring that
m P e Â°P' e of the archipelago shall be en
abled to establish a form of free gov
ernment suitable to their condition and
securing the rights of life, liberty and
property and the preservation of "order
and equal right therein assumes for the
time being and to the end aforesaid the
contro ot the archipelago, so far as such
control shall be needful for the purposes
above stated, and will provide that the
privileges accorded to Spain by Articles
I\ and \ ,>f this treaty shall be'tnjoypd."
In line 2. article VIII, after the word
Cuba, insert the words, "and the Phil
lippine archipelago." In line 3of the
same article, aft?r the word â¢'lndies" In
sert "and." In lines 3 and 4of the same
Phr '/ trlke^ t the words " and in the
Philippine archipelago "
In article IX strike out lines 171. 172 and
Â«Â« a ..?- ] m e" 2 - of artlc ' c Xln - after the
yiord Cuba, insert the words "the Phil
ippines'." In line 3of the same article
strike out the words "the Philippines."
The vote defeating the amendment
stood 30 â 53.
The voting on this amendment pro
ceeded quietly and as all the Senators
were present it was soon disposed of
The votes of Senators were closely
scanned for pointers on the approach
ing vote on the treaty itself. The only
vote considered as at all significant of
a change favorable to the treaty was
that of McEnery, who voted against
the amendment. Senator Jones of
Nevada, McLaurin and Kenney voted
for it.
The vote was immediately announced
and pages were sent scurrying through
th*> corridors to announce to the few
Senators who were not in their seats
that the culminating event had arrived
The call proceeded quietly until the
name of Senator McLaurin was an
nounced. He created the first stir of
the occasion by a speech in explana
tion of his vote for the treaty This
was the initial break in the rank.s Âr
the opposition. McLaurin made a brief
statement in explanation of his change
of position, giving the open hostilities
in Manila as the reason for it.
"1 am as I have been from the first,"
said he, "irrevocably opposed to the
expansion of our territory and should
have voted against ratification but for
the news that has come to us, over the
cable in the past two days."
He then went on to say that the at
tack upon our troops had brought
about a new condition of affairs and
that he should vote for the treaty.
This announcement created a hub
bub of excitement, for while some Sen
ators were informed that he had de
cided upon a change there were many
who were not in possession of
this information. This announcement
brought some of the opposition to his
side with remonstrances, but he re
plied to them that he could not any
longer see his way clear to cast hfs
vote against the treaty.
Continuing his remarks to the Senate
he referred to Senator Fairbanks' ap
peal to support the administration us
an assurance that the critical condition
existing at Manila could be more casiVy
handled if the treaty should be rati
fied. He, for one, was not willing to
embarrass the Government at so criti
cal a time. If, after the ratification,
the administration should fail to pursue
the proper course toward the islands
the fault would be that of the Govern
ment and not his, and he would not be
justified in committing an unwise act
by any apprehension that the adminis
tration would not do all that it should
do. He also referred to the agreement
to pass the McEnery resolution as a
pledge against expansion. In view of
this promise and in the hope that rati
fication would lessen bloodshed in the
Philippines he would, therefore, he said,
cast his vote in the affirmative.
He had hardly concluded when Mc-
Enery approached with words of con
gratulation, saying that he had de
cided upon the same course. The Louis
iana Senator made a speech of expla
nation to the Senate, publicly announc
ing himself only by, means of his vote.
Jones of Nevada *did, not vote on the

DEWEY SEIZES SCHOONER
LOADED WITH ARMS AND
AMMUNITION FOR AGUINALDO
United States Authorities Have Information
That the German Consul at Hongkong Is
Concerned in the Sale of War
Material to Filipinos.
NEW YORK,* Feb. 6.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Rear Admiral Dewey has
notified the Navy Department that he
has seized another schooner, loaded
with arms and ammunition . intendel
for Aguinaldo and his followers. â¢
The information in the possession of
the authorities is to the effect that the
German Consul at Hongkong was con
cerned in the sale of arms to the Fili
pinos, and this fact may account for
their action in keeping the matter se
cret. There is reason to believe, how
ever' that the matter has been brought
unofficially at least, to the attention of
the German authorities. The authori
ties feel satisfied that the German Con
sul will not be permitted to continue
his unfriendly course. â¢ , â¢,
This is not the first evidence the au
! room before the vote was announced,
and by unanimous consent made a brief
and feeling speech. He said that" he
was against expansion, and if ,he
thought the ratification â  of the treaty
meant expansion, he would not vote ; or
it, as he considered a policy of expan
sion would prove the ruin of the coun
try. The events in Manila during the
past two or three days,- in his judgment
were likely- to* ao more 'to discourage
expansion than anything that had hap
pened, but had at the same time pro
duced a crisis which made, the ratifica
tion of. the treaty necessary. *He con
sidered it a patriotic' duty to vote for
the treaty and consequently cast his
vote in the affirmative.

Each Had Distinguished Himself
From the Time the Regiment
Reached Manila.
RIVATE JAMES JOSEPH DEWAR.
PRIVATE JAMES JOSEPH DEWAR of Company X, First California,
the first reported of California's dead in the late battle at Manila,
was a native son of this State, having been born at San Jose. Since
his infancy he had resided in San Francisco. His disposition was gentle
and pleasant and he made many friends. In July, when Dewar determined
to go to the front, he enlisted with a friend, "Billy" Wrin, and the con
dition of their enlistment was that one should not go without the other,
and that they should always be together.
In 1892 Dewar became a member of Battery E, Second Artillery, Na
tional Guard, which afterward became Company X First California In
fantry. His brother Robert was a member of the same company. When
hostilities commenced both brothers were anxious to fight for their country's
cause, but their widowed mother could spare but one and James went. She
gave him up with the spirit of a true, patriotic woman, and now that he
has fallen she consoles herself with the feeling that he died a hero.
Dewar left for Manila on the transport Pennsylvania last July, being
among 300 recruits for the First California. Before his departure he jok
ingly remarked that owing to his extreme height, which was something
over six feet, he would make a good target for bullets. While in Manila
he started a laundry with two other soldiers and is said to have done a
thriving business. In all of his letters to his relatives and friends of this
city he never complained of camp life, being of a disposition to make the
best of conditions as he found them. His mother and sister, Mrs. C. W.
Seeley, reside at 275 Lexington avenue, in this city. Mrs. Seeley is the
wife of Lieutenant C. W. Seeley, who also is at Manila.
While in this city Dewar was employed by Waterhouse & Lester on
Beale street. He was 26 years of age.
MAJOR EDWARD McCONVILLE.
ACCORDING to Lieutenant Colonel J. W. Jones of the First Idaho In
fantry Volunteers, who lately returned from Manila, Major Edward
McConnville, the brave soldier who met death in the defense of Manila
on Sunday, was one of the most gallant officers in the service. The colonel
greatly deplores his taking off, as he esteemed him highly. In speaking of
the dead officer's past life Colonel Jones said Major McConnville was a vet
eran of the Civil War and had opposed him in a number of battles around
Richmond. McConnville was a member of McClelland's army and the
colonel was fighting with Lee.
"At the close of the war," said Colonel Jones, "Major McConnville con
tinued in the army and was sent out among the Indians. While in their
country he became conversant with their habits and temperament and in time
became one of the most successful superintendents of schools In the ser
vice. He was connected with the National Guard for a great many years
and also was a leading member of the Knights of Pythias. At the out
break of the war he, among others of his regiment, tendered his services,
as did also his only son, who is a color sergeant in the major's battalion.
"Major McConnville enjoyed perfect health throughout the campaign
and fulfilled his duties with ability. He leaves a widow and two charming
daughters, who are attending school at Lewiston, Idaho. They have my
deepest sympathy in their hour of sorrow. I feel his loss keenly as he wag
particularly close to me during the whole campaign.
"I am proud of the work performed by my regiment and hope it will
continue to win glory."
Colonel Jones will leave for his home to-night.
SERGEANT JOSEPH W. MAHK.
SERGEANT JOSEPH W. MAHR, who was killed in the battle, was
better known as "Joe" Mahr about town. He gained a reputation in
this city as an amateur boxer and was a member of the Manhattan
Athletic Club. At the first professional exhibition of the club he boxed with
Joe Kennedy. At Manila he organized and was elected president of the
first American athletic club there.
Mahr was the commissary sergeant of Company M, First California.
One . of his brothers, William Mahr, is a second sergeant, and another,
Thomas Mahr, is a corporal of the same company. He was over six feet
in height and was physically perfect. In the early engagements in the
Philippines he is said to have displayed remarkable bravery. Dr. A. P.
O'Brien, who was with the First California, but who has since returned,
speaks in glowing terms of his gallantry.
Mahr resided with his father, stepmother, five brothers and a step
brother at 537 Minna street in this city. Before the trouble with Spain arose
he was employed as a boxmaker by Hobbs, Wall & Co., and was held in
high esteem by his employers as well as by. his large circle of friends. He
was 25 years of age. â  '_____';

INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
DEFEAT OF BURNS
IN JOINT SESSION
ELATES GRANT MEN
Shortridge as a Programmer Found the
Sentiment of the Members. .
WORKING THE TELEGRAM RACKET.
What Is Evident!** a Concerted Display of Enthusiasm for
Grant Amuses Alameda's Representatives, Who Are
Recipients of Many Messages,
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- '
MENTO, Feb. 6.â To-night the Grant !
forces are elated and defiant. They are J
predicting that the contest will end this
week with the success of Grant. The'
utter defeat of the Burns forces on the
floor of the joint convention today adds
somewhat to the glee in the Grant
rooms to-night. The prime cause of
their delight, however-, is the combina- I
tion effected in Alameda County. It '
now seems clear that Pardee's friends
in that county have entered the field in
favor of the San Diego candidate. The i
first open show of Grant work in that
quarter was manifested in the dispatch
of messages to Senators Stratton and j
Taylor and Assemblyman Knowland
* imploring them to break the deadlock i
and elect a Senator. Many of the tele- j
grams expressed a direct preference for j
Grant. . * 'â¢â¢ |
The Alameda Assemblyman, Mr. j
Knowland. was able this evening to
produce twenty-eight telegrams from
his county asking him to support Grant. .
Some of the messages added the injunc- ;
tion to never vote for Burns. Some of '
the senders reside in Alameda, and it is
supposed that they are Republicans,
but others are unknown as residents of
the district which Mr. Knowland repre- ;
Bents, and nothing is known as to their
political affiliations. The Assembly- j
man has no thought of deserting the j
standard of General Barnes. It is clear |
to his mind that the plan to send him
so* many telegrams was preconcerted,
. and represents some combine rather'
.- than the sentiments of his constituents. \
'. Senator Stratton estimates that he re
ceived one hundred messages by wire
since. this morning. As he was very
busy in the Senate all day, he did not
get time to open and read all the re
' quests wired to him. The Senator; ; is f
supporting General Barnes, and is sat- j
isfied that he is representing the desires
of a majority of the people of his dis- j
trict, j The Senator did not express sur- '
* prise at the deluge of requests. In fact, I
the* pressure was' not. unexpected, as
. he knew last Saturday evening that a
move of the kind displayed to-day was
in contemplation. The Call Sunday
morning signaled the junction of Par
dee and Grant forces in Alameda Coun
ty.
In this movement Dr. Pardee is cvi
* dently getting the support of one Fed
eral office-holder. To-night it. is be
lieved that F. A. Leach, the Superin
tendent of the San Francisco Mint, as
sisted in getting men to w_*>* to Alame
. . daans in the Legislature urging them
to break the deadlock. The. Alameda
plan is to elect now a Southern Califor
nia candidate and four years hence
. take a citizen of Oakland for the place
. now filled in the Senate by ' Perkins.
The Superintendent of the Mint, who
was appointed on the recommendation
of Perkins, may take the position that
the present Senator will be able to
succeed himself four years hence, even
if Dr. Pardee should come to the front
as an aspirant. Possibly both the Su
. perintendent and the Senator would
â¢ feel better if the present contest should
I terminate In selection of a candidate
from the South.
-Senator Taylor of Alameda has had
his share of messages from the dis
trict which he has the honor of repre- j
senting. The Senator is in the Bulla j
camp, and Is not signifying any haste ]
to leave his quarters and join the
Grant forces.
Henry C. Dibble and Grove L. John
son, who vie with each other in devo
tion to Dan Burns, were chagrined and
indignant* at the specatacle of Charles
M. Shortridge, the Senatorial phono
graph from Santa Clara County, speak
ing the sentiment- of the Colonel on
the floor of the joint convention. "When
they were told by rank outsiders that
Shortridge was a programmer and was
speaking according to the programme,
they resented the suggestion with the
remark in chorus: "If this had been the
programme, do you suppose that wo
would have remained silent after Cut
ter spoke?" * â¢<"; .-
Desplte the denials from Dibble and
Johnson, there are many members of
the Legislature who believe that Short
ridge was inspired and that the inspira
tion came from Burns. No one is closer
or dearer to Dan than the eloquent
Shortridge. He knows the feeling In j
the Burns corral, and moreover he en
tertains a deep sympathy for the touts '
throughout the State who are clamoring !
for a caucus. The voluble Senator, if i
the truth be known, is probably much |
nearer the Candelaria throne than :
either Dibble or Grove Johnson, and !
when he spoke in the Senate to-day he
uttered the heartfelt sentiments of the
Colonel. The cruel way in which the!
convention turned down the Shortridge
suggestion Indicated in a striking man
ner the unpopularity of the, Burns
cause. The applause that greeted the
sentiment against a caucus In the in
terest of an unfit candidate was not all
refreshing to the touts. The "organ
ization" has received some hard knocks j
since the. opening of the Senatorial
campaign, but this one to-day in the
joint convention was the hardest of the |
battle.
After the adjournment of the Legis
lature this afternoon, Judge Dibble and
Colonel Burns were together for, an ex
change of views, but the interview was
brief. Dibble does not enjoy the meas
ure of confidence which the Colonel
daily bestows on Senator Shortridge:
From this time onward it will be un
derstood that when Shortridge speaks :
the sentiments of the Colonel are find- j
ing a channel of expression. Dibble and j
Johnson may get In and fight when the ,
time comes for the final mix-up, but
the orders on the floor will come from
Shortridge. The junior Senator from j
Santa Clara County has a retentive j
memory. and he can use the exact and
forcible language employed by the Colo- j
nel. The presence of Cutter in the
Grant camp excites the inward wrath i
of Dibble and Johnson. The three have |
done together many a pretty piece of \
politics, and they know the vulnerable j
places of one another. One of these *
fine days there will be open talk on the '
floor, of the convention.
The Burns men, while not confident |
that the "Colonel" can win out, are not '
in the slightest degree alarmed at the j
boasting of the. Grant forces. They
are as confident as ever that Grant
cannot win and Judge Dibble would ;
be willing to wager money that Grant i
cannot gain one more vote. The foot i
that Judge Dibble lost at Port Hudson i
in 1863 may be cold, but the one he has i
with him now is still warm for Burns.
He is convinced that Burns or no
body will be Senator. This defiance is j
generally expressed by the touts. They : \
have resolved that California shall
SENATOR CUTTER OBJECTS TO A CAUCUS.
have but one representative in the
United States Senate if Burns is not
chosen. _ . . \ .â  _ .
. There is talk to-night that Burns had
a motive in view when he authorized
Shortridge's speech in the joint Assem
bly to-day. It is said that he desires
that there shall be a record for future
reference wherein it will be shown that
he, (Burns) was not responsible for the
deadlock and the adjournment of the
Legislature without the election of a
Senator. The record is to show that he
offered to go into caucus and settle the
question and that proposition being. re
jected he offered to remain in session
three hours each day and continue the
balloting until a Senator was chosen.
A record of this kind will not affect the
judgment of the people of California. 1
The i responsibility for failure to elect
a Senator will rest on the "organiza
tion" and ! the \ Southern Pacific Rail
road. It is clear to the simplest mind
that they attempted to foist a man on
the Legislature. that the people of the
State cannot indorse, and in the' name
of the people the candidate of the rail
road and the "organization" is rejected,
turned down arid cast out. â¢

ASSEMBLY ROUTINE
LIVELIER THAN USUAL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 6.â The news came into the
Assembly chamber to-day that the peace
treaty had been ratified just at the mo
ment when Senate joint resolution 14
was being read for its final adoption. *
Senate joint resolution 14 calls upon
Congress- to have the boys of the First
California brought home from Manila,
and no sooner had it been read and the
news brought in that the treaty was signed
and a fresh battle on at Manila, .nan As
semblyman Dibble got up to voice the
sentiment of the- whole House.
"I should have voted in favor of this
resolution on Saturday," said he, "but to
day I shall not. Our boys out there have
been an honor to us all, and if there is
no more fighting for them they should be
brought home. But since Saturday there
has come the news that again our flag is
attacked. again* there is work for our
boys, and there is not one among them
who would thank, us if we should vote, to
bring them home 'while it is going on. I
think that in view of these late develop
ments this resolution should be passed
over." y.y-'v.--
Assemblyman Cowan of Santa Rosa sug
gested that before anything be done a
committee wait upon the Senate, but no
action on that was taken.
Belshaw of Contra Costa said he
thought the proper action would be to lay
the resolution on the table.
"We don't want our boys to come home
while there is lighting to be done," said
he. "and they. wouldn t come back if we
sent for them. We will send more boys
out there if they want them, a whole lot
more if they want them, but this is no
time to bring them home."
Mr. Dibble then moved that the resolu
tion be laid on the table, and his motion
carried by a shout of hearty and unani
mous applause. . / -, -
Then Milton J. Green was called for. It
was the usual bi-weekly summons to ap
pear and explain, but Milton came not;
Instead came the stereotyped certification
of Dr. Hatch that Mr. Green was still not
well enough to come out in the open. inr.
Works of San Diego moved that the
whole matter be held In abeyance for
thirty minutes. Mr. Works said that
within that time he expected to receive a
communication from Mr. Green that
would settle the whole "deplorable mat-
ter." y'y---'
It was so ordered, but when the half
hour was up no communication had ar
rived, and Mr. Works again asked a con
tinuance until 11 o'clock to-morrow, when
he said either Mr. Green or his communi
cation would positively appear.
The report of the Ways and Means
Committee of the Assembly for the- week
ending February 4 was rendered and
showed that hills carrying appropriations
aggregating $637,235 11 had been consid
ered during the last week.
Of this amount $3673 32 was reported fa
vorably, $112,870 unfavorably, $22,500 re
ported back without recommndation.
$150,000 referred to other committees and
$125,000 withdrawn. The total of appro
priations referred to the committee to
date is $1,060,452 10. '*â¢
The Committe on Federal Relations sent
Assembly concurrent resolution . 7 relat
ing to the election of United States Sen
ators by direct vote of the people back
to the Assembly without recommendation.
Assembly joint resolution 14, relative to
an inquiry into the alleged servitude of
Frank B.issford ii*. Siberia, and . Senate
joint? resolution 7, relative to the false
branding of food products, were recom
mended to pass. I
Assemblyman Mcllck introduced a lit
tle temperance resolution during the aft
ernoon session that was intended to close
the "well and its two auxiliaries on the
second floor of the Capitol. Mr. Mellck'a
resolution did not order the "cloakrooms"
closed; it merely condemned the practice
of selling liquor within the Capitol build
ing. The resolution, was adopted, with
only a half dozen - thirsty "noes"
against It.
The Contested Elections Committee ren
dered*' its report on the- contest of Gra
ham vs. Hoey of the Twenty-eighth As
sembly District of San Francisco. The
report : recommended that Mr. : Hoey re
tain his seat, and it was adopted unani
mously.
Assemblyman Dibble announced during
.the afternoon that according to the deci
sion of the Committee on Rules evening
sessions of the Legislature would soon be
gin, possibly this week, maybe not until
next Monday, and when the flies were
taken up it was decided to let the half
dozen election law bills that were entitled
to a reading go over until evening ses
sions should begin. Other work on the
special and third reading files was taken
up, however, and but for an unusual in
clination to debate every proposition that
.offered opportunity for spell-binding fair
progress might have been made with the
work.
. Shortridge' Senate resolution prohibit
ing polygamy in the United States and
making a polygamlst ineligible for public
offlce was one of the first matters for
consideration, but it was passed on the
file.
S. J. R. s, relating to the irrigation of
arid lands, was adopted.
The bill introduced by Meserve of San
Bernardino, which was "supposed to strike
a death blow at San Francisco's charter,
came up with its objectionable features
eliminated and was passed by a unani
mous vote. 7-.*' V
Johnson's A. B. 4, which creates an ex
empt fireman's relief fund in all cities,
counties and towns of the State, was so
amended that It will apply to only cities
of 20,000 population or over, and sent back
to the printer.
Arnerich's A. B. 245, which is designed
to reorganize the State normal school sys
tem ;Â«j, that It will be practically on the
same oasis it was when the Legislature
changed things around two years ago,
was the subject of considerable debate.
Assemblyman Conrey of Los Angeles
claimed that the only reason Arnerich had
for wishing to again shift the norma!
schools was political, and Arnerich denied
It. It has been said in the Assembly
chamber during the past few days that
the sole reason for Arnerich's bill was the
reinstatement of Professor Childs as prin
cipal of the San Jose Normal School, from
which position he was ousted under the
Democratic reorganization. There were a
half dozen amendments offered, but they
were all voted down, and Assemblyman
Valentine was delegated to amend . o iV c
measure in one or two minor Par '*" i
Adjournment was taken to the usual
hour to-morrow.
SCORING THE JUDICIARY
IN THE SENATE
! I CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
; 'â  MENTO, Feb. 6.â Indirectly, of course,
the Judges of the Superior Court of San
Francisco came in for a good roasting
in the Senate to-day, and it came from
those who wanted to raise their salaries.
i The idea in raising the salary of the
Judges was to bring better men to pre
side and not have all the good lawyers
on the wrong side of the bar.
Senator Cutter^ bill fixing the annual
salaries of the Judges of the Superior
Courts of the State came up for final pas
sage, and Senator Stratton Interrupted
the rollcall to submit an amendment. The
original bill allowed the Judges of San
Francisco $5000, and this Stratton wished
to have raised to $5200. Mr. Stratton said
j lawyers made, more money in San * ran
cisco than they did in other counties, and
therefore the Judges before, whom they
: plead should be paid . proportionately
higher. **. *' ' .. , _'7-i - â  a
Senator Simpson opposed the amend
ment, because he said under the schedule
of salaries now paid and the growing de
mand for a reduction instead or an in
crease, $4000, while not too much, was cer
tainly enough. . * ' Â» â¢
Senator Shortridge spoke for the amend
ment and the bill, for he- thought It would
' result in a better- quality of Judge.-,.
Dickinson spoke against it. for he believed
the way to raise the bench was to In
crease the term of service, not the amount
of the salary. Bettman spoke for it and
so did Wolf. . . *
Cutter didn't want* it.'- "A man wont
be honest for $80 a month," he said, "and
that's what the bill and the amendment
amounts to: a man who is not honest for
$4000 a year will not- be for. $5000." '.; and.
Leavitt echoed his words when he said,
"If a man cannot be competent for S4UOO a
year he cannot be competent for $5000.''. .:

An Interesting Bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- j
MENTO, Feb. 6.â A very Interesting bill
came before the Senate Finance Commit- j
tee this evening. It was an act making
an appropriation of $15,000 for, the relief
of August Zimmerman, who, in 1884, was
convicted of the murder of a saloon
keeper named . Krutzenthal, who was
found in his saloon foully murdered,' hav
ing his head split open with a hatchet.
Two men were arrested for the crime
August Zimmerman and Ed Neff. At the
trial Ed Neff testified that Zimmerman
had committed the deed, and it was by
that testimony that Zimmerman was con
victed, the term being for life. In 1894
friends of the convicted man who believed
in his innocence commenced work on the
case and finally obtained from Ed Neff
a confession of the falsity of his testi
mony. It is thought that Neff testified
falsely to shield his brother. John Neff,
who was also suspected of having com
mitted the murder, but who could not be
found at the time of the murder and
who has since died. On obtaining tha
confession of Neff. >the friends of Zim
merman circulated a petition, through tha
means of which the man was pardoned.
The appropriation is to pay him for tha
loss of salary and for the damage to his
personal character sustained by his
eleven-year incarceration. ; *
The committee took the matter umlet"
advisement and it will again come up at
the next meeting.

COGENT REASONS FOR BEING ABSOLVED
Political Sports Are Laying Odds on the Outcome of
|- the Matter With the Man With the Sack a
Strong Favorite in the Betting.
;â â¢ 'Call HEADQUARTERS, sacra
â¢ MENTO, Feb. 6.â Milton J. Green has
'â â "promised to do one of two things. He
â  will either appear before the bar of the
';â  Assembly to-morrow to be punished for
: '. contempt for not answering the ques
; â¢ ti.ons put to him by the investigating j
.: committee, or he will send a written I
statement setting forth the reasons [
â¢why. he has refused to answer the!
â¢questions and asking to be released I
from the obligation of doing so. The j
.Sporting members of the legislative i
â¢â '. delegation are betting ten to one to
.. -night that Green will send a written
Statement to the Assembly. Their rea
! sons for offering odds on the statement
is that if Green appears in person he
.will either have to answer the ques
â¢ tions or go to jail. He will not answer
" because by doing so he would prob
ably do an injury to his Senatorial
â  candidate. It is argued, therefore, that
â  he will fall back on the written state
ment, hoping that it will gain for him
. a delay of at least one day.
â¢ The statement will set forth that
Green has refused to answer the ques
â¢ -tions put to him for the reason that by
â¢ doing so he would be betraying confi
dences; that the answers would not
tend to convict any one of improper
acts or acts such as the Assembly
'. would be justly called upon to consider
â 'and deal with; that though he spent j
' â  mdney during the recent campaign in
...many of the counties of the State, such
.-. money was spent in a legitimate man
â . ner and for the good of the whole ticket
â â¢"."and the Republican party; that this
. money was distributed through gentle T
â¢' â  men who have the good of the party
t â  at heart and who have no desire to be
known in the matter; that the relations
â .'.between Green and these gentlemen
: were confidential for good and sufil-
V cient reasons and should be held invio
. .late not because the expenditure or any
â  moneys given to them involved trans
?â¢; actions that would be deemed in any
' ,'M-a.y Reprehensible, but because they
â¢ Were- confidential; that in view of these
..'/facts Green asks that the Assembly ab
. solve him of the charge of contempt
â .'rar.d permit the questions to go unan
â '. towered.
â¢;.':' Those who pretend to know say that
".^Green is merely sparring for time in
' order to allow the Grant men to bring j
. forth the strength they boast of hay
. ing in reserve, but which cannot be
â¢ used until the end of the week. His
ability to avert the inevitable seems
somewhat doubtful, but as he has al-
. â¢ready made a wonderful record In this
respect he may be able to continue the j
â¢-good work indefinitely. Reports from
..â the sick room say that Green is able
â  to sit up to-night and is desirous of
â¢."appearing before the Assembly in per
â â¢srm if the state of his health will per
. ..jnit.
The committee of investigation may
be dissolved by action of the Assem
â¢ bly, but nevertheless there is a strong j
.sentiment in the Legislature against I
bribery In any form. Scandal concern
, ing the corrupt use of money to influ
ence th^ election of a Senator cannot
be suppressed by closing the investiga
tion this time. The fact is cited to
â  night that the managers of the San
Diego Bank have not testified. The
books of that bank ought to show ap
proximately the amount of money
drawn out by Grant, as he testified
that the checks were drawn on that in
stitution.
Rumors are now in circulation to the
effect that the Grant managers are in
â¢ .negotiation with two well-known polit
leal bosses of San .Francisco, and that
if the investigation is now suppressed
bolder efforts than ever before prac
ticed will be used to bring strength to
â  the Grant following. Grant is pre
â¢ paring to make one more desperate ef
fort' to win the fight. The other can
. didates are not alarmed, but they are
..Apprehensive, as they cannot account
for the confidence in the Grant camp.
The tactics introduced in A lamed a
County are to be extended to Santa
Clara County. Obviously the present
purpose is to break into the camps of
Hames and 1 Julia first and then po up :
against Burns. Mr. Uulla Is confident |
. to-night that Senator Taylor of Ala
meda cannot be swerved and General
â¢Barnes Is equally confident that Sena
â¢ tor Btratton and Assemblyman Know
land will not yield to the pressure of
" th.- Alameda combine.
Indignant denials come from E. A. ]
. Meserve and Judere J. XV. McKJnlay of
â  'â  the story wired from this city to the
effect that they had asserted in Los
. Angeles that Bulla had no chance of
â¢ h^ire: chosen Senator. The statement
'. .Is pronounced absolutely false in every
. particular. Mr. Meserve says to-night j
that no such hint was thrown out at j
lyop Ancles hv either himself or Judge ,
McKinlay. He cannot imagine how !
such a report trained circulation.
â  As Colonel Burns is practically out of
â¢ .'the race, there i? considerable conjec
ture to-nisht as to the course he will
pursue to defeat Grant. It is known
â¢ that his follower* are anxious to down
â  [fltfuitl but P-arnes' standing as a candi
date is so poor that he cannot get any

RESPITE GRANTED
TO NEWSPAPERMEN
Morehouse Will Again Have to
Plead for Gore in the
Senate. â¢
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 6.â "The forty-year-old
reputation of Senator Morehouse must
not be torn from him." declared the
Senator from Santa Clara himself at
the top of his voice and to the extent
of an hour before the Judiciary Com
mittee of the Senate this evening. He
spoke rapidly and with much feeling
for the misdemeanors of the press and
demanded that his bill allowing the
killing of unfriendly reporters and mis
guided editors be reported upon favor
ably by the committee. The few mem
bers of the committee who finally
voted upon the measure would . not
â¢ stand for it, however,, but on Account
of the Santa Clara Senator's passionate
appeal * for editorial blood voted *to
return the precious 7 legislation to the
Senate without "recommendation of any
kind â "so, that Senator Morehouse. may
fight it out on the floor."
A few bills of minor importance con
sumed the time of the committee until
j close to 10 o'clock and the Senate bill
I No. 197 was called . up and Mr. More
j house started in on his career of war
| and reportorial slaughter.
The journalists, he assailed were all
in the habit of filling their ink bottles
with gall and poison and using pens of
either the caustic or trenchant brand.
He quoted from the immortal Shake
speare to show that killing editors was
a most laudable occupation and he re
ferred to that passage in the Bible
which tells of the slaying of the Egyp
tians by Moses to show that sometimes
if a man only selects the proper victim
he may rise to the dignity of a king or
get into the Senate. He made no refer
ence to Mr. Kenneally of the Assembly
nor to his efforts on behalf of the Cor
oner.
"It was a good speech, Senator,"
said Senator Curtin from Tuolumne,
and it was a good roast. . It raised the
price of boiler iron, undershirts and
coffins, and for a while made the news
paper man's field of operations a dreary
waste, and the suggestion of punctured
and bleeding reporters hung upon the
room which, singularly enough, was
one of the courtrooms of the Supreme
Court.
Senator Davis of Jackson arose. to
back up Mr. Morehouse and kill his bill.
He said he believed in the spirit of
the measure, but he believed there were
other methods of achieving the same
end. He- was not at all bloodthirsty,
and did not wish to have his path in
life strewn with the corpses of too ar
dent editors. He thought every man !
who wrote for a newspaper should be |
compelled to sign his article and thenâ I
the Injured one could fix him. Both
speakers saw much that was good in
the newspaper, but omitted to mention '
it; they saw much that was bad, and i
spent much time on the same, and not i
being newspaper men they could see j
clearly the remedy for, it all.
When it came to a vote, however, the I
committee stood 3 to _ against a favor
able recommendation for the bill and 'â 
then it decided unanimously to refer
the measure to promote v murder under
stress of ready-made excitement or
cultivated -bitterness back to the Sen
ate without recommendation of any
kind.. Afterward, however. Mr. More
house, having had the cldse attention
and uninterrupted ear of his fellow
committeemen for so long, cooled down
a little and admitted that something
short of life and heart's blood might ]
do, and he showed a "disposition to jro j
farther, into the regulation of affairs I
editorial by ; considering the suggestion i
of Senator. Davis. He even intimated \
that to-morrow he. would save the lives
of hundreds of struggling reporters and j
fear-stricken editors by dyav.ing up a i
bill making a man's signature instead I
of his life, the penalty, of -.the. crime -of
criticism of public men. but anyway
he Is going to have another chance at
scribe-baiting before a larger audience
in the Senate chamber. 7 7
The other important matter be
fore the committee was -.a bill sub
mitted to the Senate by Senator Braun
hart. regulating the fees of. shorthand
reporters in the police court?, the hill
referring in legislative language par
ticularly to San - Francisco. It was
amended to allow the reporters $7 a day
and 15- cents a folio for first conies and
7% ' cents for second copies, a consider
able increase over what Mr.-Braunhart ,
.wanted: As amended it was repotted
upon favorably. ; *

MENTO, Feb. 'â¢_.â Senator Cutter had a
I resolution that brought joy to the hearts

i hard for the State until the Belshaw act
left them out in the cold world. The Con
troller had refused to sign the warrants
of seventeen or eighteen extra employes
on the ground that their warrants had
been ordered by a three-fourths net a
four-fifths vote, as the Belshaw act de
manded. But since then the aelshaw act
has been amended until even its author
asks for an Introduction, and Mr. Cutter
â¢ thought he saw a chance to pass the war
rants by a four-ilfths vote and so com
ply with everything in and out of the
act, so he submitted a resolution authoriz
i ing -the Controller, to sign thorn all. It
j was pointed out to him, however, that
there were not four-fifths of the Senator,
present, so Cutter had his resolution post

â¢ Muenter's Bank Tax Bill.
CALL 7" HEADQUARTERS, 7 SACRA
MENTO, Feb. Câ Assemblyman . L_uenter
of San Joaquin has a bill coming up be
fore the Senate Committee on . Judiciary
within a very few days that is already
attracting 7 the :' attention' of stockholders
in the national banks of this State anu
upon -which there bids fair to be centered
a hot light before it is ' ; finally] passed :â¢ by
the Senate. The reason for corporation
opposition to Mr. Muenter*a bill is that If
his measure is enacted the owners of na
tional bank stock will be compelled to
pay their just tax on over ?9.o<>J,oo'J of
' stock that is now owned In this Stab and
upon which there has never been a dollar
| collected for the State's support <
â¢ It has been* a good thing for the stock
j holders,' and in not paying taxes on their
; holdings â â  they/: have been within their
I right' under the law*, for, of all the States
bl the' Union. California is th" only one
that has not provided tor the taxation of
; .iK i<. -tidings. '" ;"-.*'
A Ml a good deal â  similar- to the one
which Mr. Mik-.-t' ',- -has' worked through
the Assembly* was introduced two years
ago,*; but was so bitterly opposed by two
members of the Judiciary Committee,
who were attorneys for national banks,
that it failed of committee recomenda
tlon and final passage. National banks
in this State are now relieved from this
taxation, yet enjoy all the rights and im
munities guaranteed to ordinary nersons
who contribute to the expense of the
State's administration. The bill has been
claimed by its enemies to "be class legisla
tion, but this is denied by Muenter, who
says that it simply changes the taxation
laws of this State to conform to the Fed
eral enactments.
NO MONEY FOR THE
MISSES SMITH NOW
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 6.â Grove L. Johnson, the
Assemblyman from Sacramento, was be
fore the Assembly Committee on -Ways
and Means to-night to urge favorable rec
ommendation for Assembly bill 573, in
which it is said he is personally and finan
cially interested.
Assembly bill 573 is designed to make a
clean gift of $10,000, or as much of that
amount as docs not find Its way to John
son's pockets as attorney's fees past and
future, to Violet Evelyn and Ida Bernice
Smith, survivors of Ida Morrell Smith.
By the many residents of this city who
are acquainted with the history of the
Smith family and the ground upon which
it bases its claim to State funds, the bill
is declared as rank a job as ever engaged
the attention of a State Legislature.
Smith, father of the surviving Violet
Evelyn and Ida. was the keeper of a no
torious haunt of crooks and ex-convicts
of the lowest stamp. It was in the old
days, when Sacramento had not much in
the way of protection against such a
elans of people, and Grove L. Johnson
was in the heyday of his legal career. An
ex-Chief of Police of this city met his
death there. one night at the hands of an
assassin, and Smith was arrested upon
the charge and' finally convicted. He was
defended by Grove L. Johnson, who im
mediately appealed to the Supreme Court
for a new trial. The Supreme Court re
versed the decision of the lower tribunal
and the new trial was ordered.
Meanwhile Smith had become afflicted
with a pulmonary complaint and died be
fore the second trial was completed.
It is upon the lamentable fact that
Smith died that Grove Johnson bases the
claim of the Smith survivors. Mr. John-
I son argues that Smith was really innocent â 
j and that the second; trial would have de- I
I veloped thai fact had he not died while'
; in durance, leaving his family with the i
stigma of his crime upon them. This is
the basis for the claim for which John
son appeared before, the committee to- !
night to argue. With, him he brought a
string of witnesses who remembered more j
or less clearly the story of Smith's trial.
When they did not remember Mr. Johnson |
reminded them, and altogether, the pro- j
ceeding was a good deal as things are on !
the floor of the Assembly wh-jn Mr. John
son is engineering some pet measure
through and tries to run the whole ma
chine. .-. .*
Mr. Johnson pursued his time-honored
policy by making a speech. He said the I
newspapers were all liars and he did not j
expect to get justice from them anyway,
and then he objected because The Call
and the Sacramento Bee had shown up
the job In the bill which he is fostering.
His arguments, however, went; for -little |
with the committee, and when it went into ;
executive session it 'decided to' send the
measure for the relief of the Misses Smith
back to the Assembly without recom
mendation of , any sort. â¢: - 7v. Â
The oft repeated claim of Major Ramon
Pico for the restitution of JSOOO expended
by him /or the equipment of four com
panies of cavalry -during the rebellion
j came up and the aged soldier was on hand
I to urge his case.. The sympathy of the
committee was evidently with him from
the beginning and his'bill was recom
mended for passage without opposition.
Major. Picp's claim : has ..been passed
through the "houses of two Legislatures
and each -time has failed to get the sig
nature of the Governor, but it is consid
ered that he will finally get what is corn
ing to him this year in view of the opinion

lion claims should be paid. .

CHARLEY SHORTRIDGE
BREAKS THE MONOTONY
Santa Clara's Junior Senator Does a Little
Work for Dan.
Murky Atmosphere of the Assembly Chamber
Illuminated for a few Brief Minutes by
Flashes of Lurid Oratory.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 6.â lt remained for
Charles M. Shortridge, the Senator from
Santa Clara, to break in on the monot
ony that has characterized the joint
Senatorial ballot these three weeks. ( He
did 1 it this morning in a style that is
essentially his own. For as many as
five minutes the representative from
the prune section awoke the echoes and
with all the power of his well-winded
lungs and gorgeous tie he hurled large
jolts of illuminated oratory through the
stagnant atmosphere of the Assembly
chamber at the. heads of the support
ers of Grant, Barnes, 7 Bulla and every
one else that- ever refused to go into a
Burns "caucus*. It was a splendid though
futile effort. .7 â¢â 7-,.
The Shortridge opportunity presented
j itself upon the completion of the first
â  and last ballot of the day. With the
; light "of aâ â  renewed intelligence illumi
| ing his ordinarily: mobile features he
I rose : from his seat in the left of the
| chamber. -
"Mr.' Speaker," said he; "a resolu

"I would say a few words in support
of mv resolution," said Mr. Shortridge.
"I submit, sirs, that this is the: fifth
week of this joint ballet * for a United
States Senator; and ." we have not yet
succeeded in selecting to represent us
a successor to the gentleman whose

-1 publicans . and Republican majorities
came together in time-honored caucus,
decided what they wanted and went on
to the floor of the House and voted
for it,. bound by the decision of the
whole party in caucus. I submit to
you, sirs, that this is so. Why cannot
we get together as in the old days, de
cide upon. what we want in caucus and
come out here, on this floor and settle
this thing as men should?"
It was evident when Mr. Shortridge
made reference to caucus in his single
handed attempt to stampede the dila
tory legislators into a meeting, that
Dan Burns was the power that pulled
the string.
Senator Cutter of Yuba was on his
feet before the hangings on the gal
leries had ceased to rustle, and ripped
out: "Well, I'm glad to. see that the
people from Santa Clara have at last
come to the conclusion that a caucus
is the best thing that could happen."
"Hold on, there," yelled ; Senator
Morehouse. "Cut out that Santa Clara
and make, it Shortridge. Santa Clara
wants no caucus."
f "I want to say," continued Mr. Cut
ter, "that this conclusion is commend
able, although it is two years late. I
remember two years ago,' when the
gentleman had a brother a candidate
for this position, he would go into cau
cus under no consideration, for he knew
that if he did so the Republican party
would throw a man out of the race the
people of this State did not want, and
Is want to say that no man and no
power under the canopy of heaven can
force us into a caucus that would now
elect another man to the United States
Senate whom the people of this State
do not want, either." 'â _-..
â¢ Mr. J -Bettman' got his breath at this
point and; replied to Cutter in charac
teristic manner/; and then Mr. Mead, of
the minority, said he^did not see why
the minority, should be afflicted with ail
this, and he- moved that it be made the
special, order, for the next Republican
caucus. 77 7 1
President Flint wound up the spec
tacular proceedings by > putting Mr.
Shortrldge's. resolution to a vote and a
chorus of noes ; sent the Santa Claran
back to his seat.
g There 7 was no change in the ballot. It
was 7 the . . same . as on Saturday and
when Assemblyman ' Belshaw moved
adjournment there was no opposition.

THE f-JLLEGED PAVING FRAUD.
r\A AY OR PHELAX should thoroughly investi
-71 \ gate the charges preferred by the Real Estate
â  * Owners' Association against the contractors
who are engaged in laying a bituminous rock pave
: tjientVon Market street, between Sixth and Van Ness
avenue. The allegations are that basalt blocks in the
gutterways have been laid upon four inches of sand
with only four inches of concrete underneath, that
tlie -roadway is being placed upon five instead of nine
â¢:,irtch'cs-;.of 'concrete and that the concrete itself in both
-* ca?es'is only about one-half the required strength.
.â¢An e^.pert.Qf the association, it is stated, examined the
<\vofk as, it progressed and he reports that the con
â triiv.tVir- are .using-, seventy-five cubic feet of rock and
liand'tbprie barrel* of cement, which is about I to 21,
*.'i_st-_d-.of i to "8.
.- if.7the.se charges are true an example ought to be
/made"-. the contractors. San Francisco is spending
,a. great deal bl" money upon the repaying of Market
.street,. one purpose being to provide the people with
.'.-a : object lesson in smooth pavements, which will
convince them when the time comes that it is good
'policy to reconstruct all of the accepted streets and
. that. bitumen laid on concrete is the best pavement
"that- can be introduced: But if fraud is permitted in
flic work, long before we get to the point where a
general system of improvements will be inaugurated
â¢Mai street will be hogwallow and bitumen pave
â¢ ments will be in disgrace.
It is easy to understand the spirit which governs
the ordinary street contractor. He has no interest in
his work, excepting to get it down in just as.slipshod
a manner as possible and charge the highest price.
Such a thing as public spirit among corporations and
individuals engaged in making public improvements
is practically unknown. Therefore, while no reflection
is intended upon this class of business men, it must
be said that they will always bear watching.
Mayor Phelan may very properly subject these
charges to thorough analysis. If he finds that the
contractors have been cheating and that a pavement
i- being laid which yields them more profit than they
arc legitimately entitled to, he ought to make an ex
ample of them. Street contractors in San Francisco
have lost a great deal of money through their own
cupidity, but we have never heard of one who profited
by the lessons. Market street is so conspicuous a
case that it may well be erected into a precedent.
COLONEL SMITH OF TENNESSEE.
CL WILLIAM C. SMITH. First Tennes
see, died of apoplexy at the head of his com
mand on the firing line, February 5.
OTIS.
Such was the brief telegram which came from Ma
nila to announce the death of as loyal a patriot and as
royal a gentleman as ever fought for principle or gave
a hand in friendship. Colonel Smith was a soldier. j
In the days long gone he had battled for the Confed- !
eracy, and he had not laid down his arms until the j
leaders of the Southern, cause had given up hope, j
How nearly right or how nearly wrong he may have
been matters nothing now. It is enough to remember
that when the country needed him he was ready for
.the call. He left his home, his lucrative business,' and
went to fight for the commonweal, making light of the
burden of years, thinking only of the honor of the
land.
Of all the volunteer officer.*, who passed through this
city, probably not another won so many friends. A
person of dignity, gallant, .modest, courage beaming
from his eye, the best homes gladly welcomed him as
a guest, and more than one veteran wearing the sign
of the G. A. R. broke bread with him gladly. For old
things had passed away, over all there waved one
flag, and among its noble defenders was this son of
the South this chivalrous, gentle, broad-minded man.
type of citizenship of. which the North and the South
. may be" proud. * ..
There will be mourning in Tennessee over this citi
zen, who freely gave his life, and there will be mourn
ing in California, where he came as a stranger, .and
whence he departed respected and beloved.
It is bad form for the Examiner to lament over hav
ing been beaten on the news from Manila. It is not
our habit to boast about these things. We simply
print the news, print all of it, and if the mourning
competitors yowl they have at least the privilege of
suspending and dropping the foolish bluff.

THE THIRD BATTLE OF MANILA.
THE action begun Sunday morning by an attack
on our outposts at Manila is the third battle
there under our flag. The glory of American
aims has been .veil sustained in each, and there is
j no difference of opinion at home upon the credit
I due to our fighters on land and sea. Such differences
arc reserved "for expression upon the issues of policy,
which involve our own Government and imply
changes in its structure and functions. It is now
evident that acquisition of the Philippines must be
by conquest. Spain sells us a quitclaim, but we must
write our title in fee simple in the blood of the peo
ple.
A great deal of crude comment has followed this
expected action at arms, much of it gen-rated in the
enthusiasm which ever follows a fight. -It is the same
feeling which has sustained every British" Ministry
â¢ that has put on the armor of aggression, and added
j to the glory of British arms in zones distant from the
, Anglo-Saxon center. From the time we first set foot
. on Luzon there has been no doubt that we could whip
] any force the Filipinos might bring against us in a
I set battle; and it aas certain from the first that we
could occupy as much of the islands as Spain had
occupied, by using the same means which asserted
and maintained the occupancy, which she quitclaims
for twenty millions. The Call said that we could con
| quest the Philippines, and, saying that, meant that by
no other means could we assert our sovereignty over
1 them. The third battle of Manila has confirmed this.
It may cost us as much as the conquest of India, for
the Malay will fight like the Sikh and Mahratta. The
real issue for our people to consider is not the con
, -quest, but its consequences. To hold these Asiatics
,we must maintain a perpetual military occupation.
The experience of every nation that has dealt with
them is that any relaxation of military vigilance means
a massacre. We talk in high strain about educating
the Malays and mixed races. They need and prize it
as little as did the sons of Rob Roy. We* have also
heard some talk of their physical assimilation with us.
â The tropical races take to themselves the blood of
â¢ the non-tropical races, only to eliminate it by assimi
lation.
The Aryans were a white' race. They descended
i upon India from the Northwest and deployed upon
j the hot plains of that peninsula with this same view
jof assimilating the dark races they found there. In
! the old Sanskrit ritual is a prayer of the Aryans, in
which they thanked God that He was preserving the
whiteness of their skin. But that color, which waS
their race mark, disappeared such long ages ago that
its only record is in that prayer of thanks preserved
' in a language that was dead before the tongue spoken
in Babylon was born.
The tropical and Asiatic races of the Philippines
will persist. If there is to be any human life there
at all, its breath must be in their ribs and its soul in
their bodies.
We have met them precisely as did their Spanish
masters, and our relations will not much differ from
what they have known under Spain. '
Their political and physical assimilation with us is
impossible, and this opening battle in the tragedy of
their conquest only casts a deeper shadow upon our
situation. In such matters an opportunity once passed i
returns no more. When we descended from the lofty
position on which we began war with Spain we
plunged into trouble of which no eye can now see
the end. Had we stood fast by our professions, had
we not turned them into pretenses, had we followed
I the treaty of Paris with an immediate assurance to
! the Filipinos that we were buying their freedom of
Spain and that she was not selling them for cash to
a new master, the way would have been made plain to
an adjustment by which we would have recouped the
money cost of their deliverance and made them free.
As far as mortal ken can penetrate this opportunity is
gone and will not return. It presented an honorable
and creditable way out of a delicate and dangerous sit
uation. But we did not follow it, because the voice
of reason was drowned by the thunder of the war
drum, and the instincts of freedom and peace were
supplanted by the lust of conquest and thirst for
battle.
It remains for those who have been responsible
for our present situation to find a way out of it as
honorable as would have been the refusal to enter
it at all.
The domestic situation is unchanged. The perils of
imperialism are perils still and become more threaten
ing as the certainty of conquest increases. We have
become suddenly sensitive of the opinions of other
nations, which judge us by their standard, a standard
which we have heretofore treated with indifference or
repudiated altogether. We are the new boy at
school, compelled by the public opinion of his class
to whip his fag. We can do that easily, but can we
as easily endure what follows?
GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES.
WITH the report of the outbreak of hostilities at
Manila there comes from Washington, what
has now grown to be something like a stereo
typed statement, that our Government is suspicious of
German interference. The dispatches of yesterday
stated: "Though reassured by representations made,
by the Berlin Government that it completely recog
nizes American sovereignty over the archipelago, the
authorities have not forgotten the attitude of Ger
many during the war, and there is reason to believe
the warships of that power will be watched with more
anxiety than those of any other nation." ,
There must surely be some reason for these .re
peated efforts to arouse distrust, in this Â«" country
against the Germans, but it is not easy to discover
what the reason is. That the German press at the
outbreak of the war declared sympathy with .Spain
is unquestionably true, but the German Government
preserved a strict neutrality, and for some time past
there have been repeated evidences given of a friendly
feeling on the part of the German people toward the
United States, and an earnest desire to cultivate closer
relations with us. * ]7.'V â¢'â '-.'â¢ - .â¢ â¢ ?â¢*
Recent dispatches from Berlin state 7 that for the
purpose of promoting commercial relations with** the
United States .a company has been organized in that
city to lay a direct cable to connect the two countries.
A capital of 20,000,000 marks has been subscribed and
the success of the enterprise seems* well assured. "'That
project in itself is a fair proof the Germans are not
contemplating any act of hostility to the United
States by reason of anything which has occurred or is
likely to occur in any part of the world.
It is to be noted moreover that German comments
on the recent disturbances, at Samoa have not been
of* an unfriendly or prejudiced character.. The Ger
man Government has, of course, maintained that its
representative at Apia is not responsible for the con
troversy with the American: and the British repre
sentatives, but that, of course, was to be expected. No
nation will disclaim the acts of its representatives
abroad until a thorough investigation shall have
shown them to be unjust or unauthorized.
In the meantime Embassador White has declared
the recurring rumors of German* hostility to our con
duct of affairs in the Philippines to be absolutely base
ness. ;* He has recently stated: "So far. from quarreling
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1899.
at this late day over our Pacific possessions, they are
now more and more inclined to work with us in the
extension of commerce and civilization."
Germany is bound to the United States by many
ties, some of a sentimental, some of a business nature.
There is hardly a family in Germany that has not
seme relative or friend living in this country -.'hardly
a large commercial house that has not business rela
tions with us. Hostility to the United States on the
part of the Germans -would be hostility to their own
kin and their own interests. With* such bonds between
the two nations it is not likely the"' peace will be
broken, nor is it probable that the Government at
Washington has any suspicion of German interference
at Manila or elsewhere.
THE : PROFLIGATE CANDIDACY. y
THE crocodiles of Egypt and the alligators of
America are impervious to ordinary weapons.
They are types of the corruptionists who are
sweating in their desperate effort to unite the rotten
elements of politics in order to force the election of
Dan Burns to the Senate of the United States. These
j men are equally destitute of â¢ honor and of shame.
They are without national patriotism or State pride.
. Their armor of infamy is impenetrable. It is said
| that a crocodile occasionally can shed tears, but no
| sentiment can faze their stolidity. They are without
j real intelligence. They know that their chief pos
j sesses no qualification and every disqualification for
the office to which he has the Arctic coolness to
i aspire, but that knowledge is only derived from his
, j analogy to themselves. They have no conception
J and no desire or ability to acquire a conception of
what good citizenship means. The interests of Cali
fornia, the welfare of the country, only excite their
derision and their contempt. They are indifferent
even to appearances before the million and a half
cf our own people, the eighty millions of the Union
and the seven or eight hundred millions of civilized
mankind. The great Republican party to them is not
; a living organization, with a national soul and a na-
I tional history, but a Juggernaut car of the poorest
construction, fitted exclusively to the railroad track,
its axles greased with unclean drippings, and its
motive power a combination of venality and cunning.
These men are traitors to the divided sovereignty
that preserves the equilibrium of our institutions and
to the reserved sovereignty of the people. They are
traitors to truth, to honor and to decency. Their
function in life is to maintain "the cohesive power of
public plunder." Obstinately bent on the accomplish
; ment, by any means, of their foul and most unnatural
; purpose, they absolutely glory in the hope that
i they may caricature and degrade the State before the
| Union and before the world.
For weeks they have held the joint legislative
convention in their loathsome grip. Will they ulti
mately succeed? That is the question to be answered
by the ninety-four legislators who control the situa
tion. These gentlemen have before them a pointed
object lession from the State of Indiana. There the
political machine was burst into shreds and the
best precedents in American history and the concen
trated instructions of the American people followed and
obeyed. The Indiana Legislature rebuked the rising
arrogance of wealth, turned from its proper use into
the channels of political preferment, by electing to the '
Federal Senate a young man who. like both of our !
martyred Presidents, emerged from poverty and I
from obscurity and by labor, by perseverance and j
by integrity, made for himself a shining fame and |
reached the elevation of American statesmanship.
Such a record and such' a recognition constitute a â 
splendid vindication of the lifting power of Ameri- j
can institutions.
The example and the warning are definite and
piominent. Will they be heeded? Let not ninety
four but a hundred and twenty legislators respond.
The Call has opposed Dan Burns because his
election would be a triumph for evil and a reproach
to the State. In a lesser degree, but with firmness,
it has opposed Ulysses S. Grant Jr., because he
has violated the ethics of candidacy and his only
manifest claim is hereditary distinction. It has in
sisted upon no candidate of its own. It has protested
for the public good. It now repeats the inexorable
and loud demand of the people for the prompt
election of a Republican, a statesman and a gentle
man.
I.ZIJ OR some unaccountable reason the Hawaiian
bill has been seemingly shelved. Weeks ago
the announcement was made that the committee
having it in charge was prepared to report it, and yet
nothing has been done about it, nor has any definite
time been fixed for its consideration.
The delay is the more difficult to understand
because the measure is one of some urgency. Since
Hawaii has been annexed it is assuredly the duty of
Congress to provide a form of government for its
people, and bring the administration of the islands
into conformity with that of the rest of the United
States. The present condition is one of uncertainty
and cannot fail to be prejudicial to the business in
terests of the Hawaiians and to some extent of all wlio
have commercial relations with them.
In a recent interview on the subject Chairman
Knox, who has charge of the bill, stated, among the
reasons why the measure is one of urgency, that there
has been a large influx of Japanese immigrants to
Hawaii.. since the annexation law was enacted, and
that some 10,000 contract labor Japanese will be
brought into Hawaii, and then into the United States.
For this reason the extension of the United States
immigration restriction to Hawaii is held to be ol
first importance. â 
That statement is one of considerable interest to
California. If Hawaii, under the present government,
i*- being filled up with coolie laborers who will here
after come to the United States, it is certainly high
time to set aside the existing government and put
American law into effect. It is to be hoped the ad
vocates of the importation of cheap" labor are not at
bottom the cause of the unexplained delay in taking
up the measure.
It appears the chief objection made to the bill in
committee was based upon a provision which con
fers upon the Hawaiian Supreme Court the power to
pass upon election cases and the qualification of mem
bers of the Legislature. That is a radical departure
from the method which prevails throughout the
United States, where legislative bodies- are made
judges* of the qualifications of their own members.
Such an objection, however, on the part of a minority
of the committee, does not offer a sufficient reason
for holding the bill back. s
The issues' involved in the delay are likely to prove
of more than ordinary importance. Only four weeks
remain for this Congress to do its work, and it has
many important bills before it. With a little scheming
the Hawaiian Government bill ; could be set aside for
the next Congress to deal - with. That would mean
a '.delay of about a year. In that space of time, it
would be possible for the cheap labor people to im
port a good many coolies into the islands before the.
â¢American restriction laws are put into force.
THE HAWAIIAN BILL.
LATEST BANK FAILURE.
Evan J. Coleman, First President of the Bank
Commission, Calls for Reform.
Editor Call: The failure of the Union
Savings Bank of San Jose so soon after
its examination and indorsement by
the Bank Commissioners again calls
into question the usefulness of this
important commission.
For many years after its inception in
1878 the Bank Commission did good
work and enjoyed the public confi
dence.
7 It was a great mistake, in my opin
ion, to" incumber the Bank Commission
with the care of banks in- liquidation.
The proper duty of bank examiners
is, so far as vigilance will do it, to
prevent banks from failing, Instead of
using their time and talents in looking
after those that have failed.
They should be doctors, not under
takers.
Since the supervision of failed banks
and other duties outside of the real
objects of their office were Imposed
upon them, the usefulness and prestige
of the Bank Commissioners have been
steadily on the wane. Indeed, since
the scandalous failures of the Pacific,
People's Home and other banks, six
years ago, after favorable reports from
the Commissioners, the â¢ opinion has
been growing that the commission does
more harm than good.
Much of the blame for the inefficien
cy of the Bank Commission rests upon
the appointing power. There have
been too many changes in the person
nel of the commission. Think of it.
Nineteen new and inexperienced Com
missioners in twenty-one years!
The defiling hands of politicians
should never have been laid upon this
office.. Ability and integrity should be
the only qualifications for members of
this board, and no changes unless "for
cause."
The Bank Commission, with super
visory power over institutions handling
$275,000,000, of which nearly $200,000,000
belongs to depositors,' is the most deli
cate and important office in the State.
It was intended for a higher and no
bler fate than that of a "four years'
home" for the Governor's Impecunious
political friends. '7;;
At least one of the Commissioners
should always be a resident of San
Francisco, whose banks subject to
their supervision handle $181,000,000 of
depositors' and stockholders' money.
The last eight appointees have been
residents of Oakland, Marysville, Pasa
dena, Salinas, Los Angeles (two), Gey
serville and San Jose. Is it surprising
that the press and public of late
years speak of the commission as use
less and one that should be abolished?
Herewith I hand you a copy of a let
ter written by me to Governor Budd
four years ago, which deals with this
subject in extenso, and its publication
at this time can do no harm and may
lead to amendments to the law during
the present session of. the Legislature
that will put new life and vim into this
once useful and respected commission.
Yours respectfully,
EVAN J. COLEMAN.
San Francisco, Feb. 4. 1899.
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 23, 1895.
Hon. James H. Budd, Governorâ Dear -
Sir: In view of the fact that a bill is be
: fore the Legislature to double the travel
| ing fund of the Bank Commissioners and
] make other changes in the bank commis
i sion act, the following facts, figures and
suggestions j may be of some value: â¢ k : %
When the first Board of Bank Commis-
I sioners was inaugurated, in 1878, the total
I number of banks in the State under its
i jurisdiction was 84, with $100,000,000 of de
! posits and- $152,000,000 of resources. Vr. Its
: first year's examinations. revealed the In
solvency of five savings banks (with $11,
--500,000 of deposits) and the impairment of
capital of eight other banks.
The efficiency and (Usefulness of that
board has never been questioned, from the
fact that no banks (except those ciosed by
i its orders) failed during its four years
' term of offlce or for many years after
j ward. ' v>
The labors of the Bank Commissioners
! have more than doubled since the office
I was createdâ the deposits in savings banks
alone having grown from $52,000,000 In 1882
! to $136,000,000 in 1893.
The supervision of banks in liquidation
I was in 1887 added to the duties of the
Commissioners. *"*"his is a very onerous
i duty, as it takes more time to supervise
i the affairs of one insolvent bank and to
.settle the differences between depositors
j and stockholders than to examine twenty
solvent banks.
For the past five years (since the great
increase in the number of banks in all
parts of the State) It has been a physical
impossibility for three men, uowever
capable and diligent, to do thoroughly the
work required of this commission. The
occurrence of so many disastrous failures
during the last board's term (1890-94), after
"clean bills of health" from the Commis
sioners, has almost destroyed the public
confidence heretofore enjoyed by this im
portant commission. Bank examiners are
not infallible, but perfunctory work on
their part is worse than none at all. â¢
A comparison between the work devolv
ing upon the first board (1878) and that of
1893 offers a partial excuse for the ap
parent Incompetency of the latter. The
board of 1878 made yearly examinations of
only 84 banks, with $152,000,000 in resources.
The board of 1893 was required (In addi
tion to supervising failed banks) to visit
and examine 233 banks) of which 206 were
outside of San Francisco) with $275,000,000
in resources. The time consumed in
traveling is a very large Item, and is one
of the principal reasons for an increase
,in the number of Commissioners here
after recommended.
The change every four years in the per
sonnel of the commission (there have been
fifteen new men since its creation) is a
heavy handicap to its "efficiency. â  Ex
perienced bank examiners can do better
work than new ones, and In half the time.
In view of the foregoing, the following
changes in the bank commission act are
suggested: . . .. â â  -..-.
1. Increase the number of Commission
ers from three to five.
2. Provide that not more than three
shall be members of the same political
party and that the three present Com
missioners shall be allowed to serve out
their terms of office.
This is to 'prevent, the frequent changes
for political reasons only, and will always
keep at least two experienced men in the
board.
. 3. Provide that two of the Commission
ers shall be residents of San Francisco,
whose twenty-six banks have $1-1,000,000
of reserves, as against $87,000,000 held by
204 banks in other parts of the State.
Local knowledge of property values and
of the financial standing of borrowers is
all important for effective bank examina
tions. For similar reasons It might be
well to have one of the Commissioners
a resident of Los Angeles to look after
the banks of Southern California. .
4. The absurd provision that one of the
Commissioners shall be an "expert of ac
counts" (which has never been compiled
with) should be substituted by providing
that one shall have practical knowledge
of the values of country lands. .
5. The : secretary should be a competent
accountant (with a salary of $200 per
month) and empowered to assist the Com
missioners in bank examinations when
ever deemed necessary by them. '.-:..
6. Provide that the annual assessment
to meet the expenses of the Bank Com
mission be levied * hereafter on the basis
of. the resources of the banks instead of
the â  deposits, as heretofore. . â  ,
-, Bank supervision benefits stockholders
as well as â¢ depositors, â¢ and they should,
therefore, bear their share of the burden.
Heretofore the savings banks have had to
carry more than a fair share of the load,
as deposits only were assessed and capital
not at all. â¢â¢'-â â *. â â .:-â - - '
6. Increase the traveling fund of the
Commissioners from $1500 to $2000 per year.
. 7. . Make, the allowance for fuel, sta
tionery, etc., $500 per year, instead of $300
as now, with the distinct understanding
that this includes all printing of blanks,
reports, etc., and that this expense does
not fall on the State Printing Offlce as
heretofore. -
I If the foregoing amendments are adopt
ed the total annual expense of the Bank
Commission will be $23,800 instead of $15,
--300 as at present. â¢
v The total resources of all the active
banks in the State under * the jurisdiction
of the- Bank 'Commission or. January 1
1895. which will be the basis for next
July's assessment, aggregated nearly
! $265,400,000, which was' distributed as fol
! lows: :-'".â 
59 savings banks $141.4.
171 commercial bank 5......... 1-6.917,500
130 banks $203,394,000
To meet the annual expense of the Bank
Commission in 1597 ($13,400), required a
pro rata assessment of 16% cents on each
$1000 of deposits.
To raise the Increased amount ($23,800)
on the new basis (resources Instead of de
posits) will require an assessment of less
than 9 cents or. each $1000 of resources.
-The voluminous annual reports issued
by the Bank Commissioners at heavy ex
pense to the State Printing Office should
be discontinued. Their report for 1594
contained 582 pages of matter of little
value even to bankers, while that of the
Comptroller of the Currency (with 3756
national banks under his jurisdiction) had
only 420 pages. *-â  v-_. : â¢"-
If other State boards and commissions
are indulging in similar extravagance it
is not surprising that there is such a
deficit in the State Printer's office.
Inspired by no selfish motive, but simply
a desire that the prestige of the Bank
Commissioners may be recovered, the
foregoing ls hereby submitted. Yours
respectfully, EVAN J. COLEMAN.

TO IMPROVE OUTSIDE STREETS
The Mission Federated Improvement
Club Advocates a Linj of
Progress.
The large area of the city lying south
west of Twenty-fifth street and the
county line, it is claimed, has been great
ly neglected during the entire history of
the city so far as appropriations ior
streets and other purposes are concerned.
To prevent a continuance of this condi
tion of things the section mentioned is
now represented by a federated club em
bodying' the entire southwestern portion
of the city.
This club embodies the following clubs
and delegates:
Holly Park Clubâ H. E. Winkler,
Thomas O'Neill, A.. S. Lillie.
Fairmount and Glen Park Clubâ Joseph
Heck, Joseph Tuohey, Chris Stader.

Ocean View Property Owners' Clubâ A.
T. Roberts, H. E. Griffiths, J. Blanchard.
The delegates of this federation are de
termined to have the district represented
by them improved. * .
The first and more Important questions
that will at once be brought to the at
tention of the Supervisors are the con- j
struction of outlet sewers and a sewer
age system for Falrmount, Sunnyside, !
Ocean View, Holly Park and Excelsior
districts; the opening of streets to con
nect Mission street and San Jose avenue,
the extension of a boulevard through
Glen Park to connect with Golden Gate
Park, the paving of San Jose avenue and
Chenery. street and better street car fa-*
cilities for Falrmount, Sunnyside and
Ocean View.* .
Strong opposition will be entered
against the. action of the Market Street
Railroad Company in taking the side
walks on Bosworth street from the peo
ple and , converting the entire street sur
face Into a roadbed for its double track
of electric cars on Its . newly acquired
franchise on the road leading from Mis
sion Hill to Glen Park.
As soon as the streets are improved i
sufficiently, the club will come to the '
front with: a request for lights, sewers,
schoolhouses and - engine-houses for pro
tection against fire.

RAILROAD
LOSES A SUIT
OF IMPORTANCE
Involves Vast Land
Interests.
COULD NOT GIVE TITLE
DESERT BETWEEN MOJAVE AND
NEEDLES IN DISPUTE.
This Is Said to Be but the Fore
runner of Suits Aggregating
Half a Million
Dollars.
Justice of the Peace Thomas F. Dunn
decided a case against the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company yesterday which
is said to be but the forerunner of a series
of suits involving over half a million dol
lars. Louis Lipman sued to recover
$226 SO paid the railroad company for a
quarter-section of land lying between Mo
jave and The Needles, within the main
line grant of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, under act of Congress of July 27,
1566. . The company had no patent for the
land in controversy and had never estab
lished its title to the land, hence the de
cision in favor of the plaintiff for the
amounts he had paid as principal and in
terest. No deed was ever delivered to the
plaintiff for the land, and it was upon
the provisions of a contract requiring that
that he based his rights to recover.
In deciding the case Justice Dunn de
cided two questions. First, has it been
finally determined that . patent shall not
issue? He says: % â  ; * --â 
The land in controversy here lies be
tween Mojave and The Needles, and is with
in the main line grant of the Southern Pa
cific Company, under the "act of Congress
of July 27, 1866, and Is not land claimed
by the defendant as a branch line under
the act of Congress of March 3, 1871,
In the case of Schwartz vs. Southern Pa
clflc Railroad Company, decided on Septem
ber 19, 1898, by his Honor, Judge Seawell,'
it was held that under the cases of U. S.
vs. S. P. Co., 14*? U. S. 570, and S. P. Co.
vs. U. S., 168 U. S. 1. It had not been finally
determined that patent shall not issue to
..defendant for land within the main line
grant under the act of July, 1865.
In the case of U. S. vs. S. P. R. R. Co.
et al., 86 Fed. Rep. &61, decided April 25.
1898, wherein the particular land in contro
versy here was litigated. It was held by the.
Circuit Judge that patent shall not issue to
defendant herein for this land. This case,
is now on its way to the Supreme Court of
the United States, and the decision of the
latter tribunal will directly decide the
status of this property. .
I shall hold that it has not been finally
determined that patent . shall not issue to
defendant for the land in controversy in.
this action. . - â¢ '
Has the defendant used ordinary â¢diligence
to procure a patent?
From the testimony 'of Jerome Madden-' a
witness for the defendant, it appears that
there was no attempt at selection of this
land, or to make any listing thereof In
the land offlce, under the art of July 27,
1866. prior to the 31st of August, 1594; in
other words, that, within a few dayÂ». It
was six years after the execution or the.
contract hereinbefore mentioned before any
steps were taken as to the acquiring- of a
patent to the land. The reason assigned for
the failure to make selection prior to said
last mentioned date was that the Secre
tary of the Interior had not approved, until
September, 1897, of the report filed on De
cember .27. l&i4, made by the commissioners
appointed by the President to report upon

I am of the opinion that the defendant
failed to use ordinary diligence to. procure
a patent for the land in controversy*, and,
considering the fact that the plaintiff did
not go Into possession of the property: that
his rights under the contract, so far as the
use of timber and making of permanent im

ed and Inasmuch as the defendant has
never established its title to the land, I am
also of the opinion that the plaintiff is en

CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT

REINSTEIN BELIEVED TO BE
THE FAVORITE.
Stupendous Work Before the Execu
tive Committee of the Pacific
Ocean and International
. Exposition.
In view of the Important action to be
"taken at the meeting of the general com
mittee of the Pacific Ocean and Interna
tional Exposition this afternoon, it is ex
pected that there will be an unusually
large dance. Notification went out
yesterday to every member of the com
mittee informing him that at the meeting
to be held 'to-day there would be elected
th-.- permanent officers of the organiza
tion.
Owing to the stupendous work that is. to
lie entrusted to the men who will be at
the head of this great enterprise, their
selection will be made with the greatest
cAre and deliberation. Not only is great
'. interest manifested as to who will be
chosen president of the body, but nearly
equal interest attaches to the personnel
...v>f the other five officers, who, with the
. chairmen of the nine standing committees
"to be appointed, will comprise the board
of directors or executive committee. It is
probable that the committee chairmen
win also be selected to-day.
Borne of the names more prominently
mentioned for the presidency are: Mayor
Phelan, Charles L. Patton, J. B. Rein
stein. \\. F. Dohrmann aijd George A.
Newhall. It is conceded that any one of
these men would prove himself equal to
" the gigantic task of bringing the exposi
tion to a highly successful consummation.
and the work of selection will be one of
difficulty and delicacy, owing to this em
â  barrassment of riches.
The work before the projectors is one of !
.multitudinous details and of world-encir
cling extent. ; The nations of the world
. Will have to be interested and exhibitors
. attracted from every corner of the earth. i
â  The task will be a much more onerous one !
than was involved in establishing the Mid
winter Fair. For. tin latter many of the:
; exhibits of the Chicago Columbian Expo- !
s-tion wore available, and these were
within a few days' travel of San Fran-:
- S sco ' , i . I(J I"> es a*""*"" entertained that the
Paris fair o' 1900 will be a promising field
from which to draw material; but this
will be no easy task, as many of the coun- â 
tries of Europe have vast expositions each
year, and they will be in keen competi
tion with San Francisco.
J. P. Reinutein. the temporary chairman ]
of the organization, has gained a strong
hold on the consideration of the members
of the general committee by his careful j
and judicious piloting of the enterprise
â¢ to the present time, and strong pressure i
:s being used to induce him to accept the
permanent" chairmanship. It is feared
â¢however, tat because of the great drafts i
. that are already being made on his time i

DEATH BRINGS A

JACOB KLEIN, the Carson brewer,

Sunday night.. His death records the
â¢': 7passing of another of Nevada's" and
.-â¢ progressive citizens, and his loss will

, -. and managed its affairs at a time when
'â "-the Comstoek mines poured out their
* rdlvor store. -and bullion and coin passed

famous Hale & Norcross steal rode, and
later a clerk. 11. K. Brown, looted the con

placed in his possession for safekeeping.
7 when those associated with Klein in the
bank divided the spoils, it was found that
the bulk of the money had been taken
from Klein'- personal account, and he
was obliged to bear the burden of the
loss. Whatever may have been transacted
through the bank of a sinister character,
It may safely be said that the man who

Racing From Baltimore'

j Ammunition and supplies are what i
i Uncle Sam is going to rush to Manila. He j
I thinks there are plenty of soldiers there j
now to handle the Filipinos and the reg- j
| ulars will be sent. along as at first in
j tended. The steamer Roanoke now in
Oakland Creek may be chartered and
j sent away with another regiment, but |
; supply ships are what will be leaving j
j this port for the next week or so.
The Centennial is now loaded and will 1
probably get away early this morning.
She has a full cargo of general supplies '
and will probably reach Manila inside of
thirty days. The Connemaugh left Seat
tle yesterday for this port and on her
j arrival she will probably load munitions
jof war for the army and navy. The Cel
' tic and Justin now at Mare Island are
â  being overhauled and will be ready for a
trip to the Philippines in a few days. The
: Justin will carry coal for the fleet and
the Celtic frozen meat for the soldiers
and sailors.
The steamer Cleveland is hourly ex
pected here from Seattle, and It is said
along the front that she will be char- i
tered to carry stores. The Cleveland has I
been thoroughly overhauled at Seattle
and is now in first class shape.
j All these vessels could be loaded and
1 dispatched in a week or ten days. so
; Dewey and Otis should be well supplied
with munitions of war and provisions in
a little over a month.
The Celtic, Centennial, Connemaugh,
Cleveland, Justin and Roanoke will make
j quite a fleet- and they should have no I
trouble in keeping the soldiers and sailors i
in the Philippines well equipped with the i
necessaries.
Burglars are making their presence felt '
| along the front. Sunday night or early !
; Monday morning they broke into the
: store of M. D. Vanvales & Co. and made i
J quite a haul. They must have used a i
wagon to remove the things, as they !
could not have carried them away ex- !
cept by making several visits to the place. I
After going over his stock, Michael
\ anvaies finds that the burglars got
away with seven gallon cans and nine
half-gallon cans of imported olive oil, I
thirty Roman cheeses imported from Italy,
a dozen tins of canned olives, a bunch of
bananas and two boxes of apple.* The :
door of the store had been burst. open, and
the goods taken were close to the en- '
trance. Mr. Vanvalea is of the opinion!
that his place was -robbed after 7 a. m. !
yesterday. At that hour the batman fed :
the felines in the store, and he said the
door was not burst open at that hour.
The police are working on the case, but i
have been unable to discover any trace
of the burglars. ,
The ships Marion Chilcott and Erskine '
M. Phelps are supposed to be racing to '
this coast from Baltimore. The Phelps
is. a new vessel on her first. voyage, and
is 133. days out. The Chilcott was form- 1
erly the British ship Kilbrannan. She
went ashore in a fog during a visit to '
Puget Sound, and was got off and sold i
to Barneson & Chilcott of Seattle, who
fixed her up and put her under the Amer- ''â 
ican flag. On January 29 she was spoken '
by. the schooner Ethel Zane In latitude 44
north 134 west, and should make the sound â¢
any time now.
The collier Washtenaw has returned to
port, and Captain Crosscup denies most
positively that he refused to answer the
signals of distress from the schooner j
Nettie Sundborg. It will be remembered
that the steamer Coquille River supplied '
the Sundborg with provisions last month i
and the captain said the Washtenaw had 'â â 
passed without paying any attention to <
the- signal of distress. Captain Crosscup
says that at the time mentioned it was i
blowing a southeast gale, and was very
thick. In consequence, he could not and !
did not see the schooner, and even if he
had sighted her the weather was so
heavy that he could not have rendered as- !
sistance. - *
Schooner and Bark Foul.
The loner Maggie C. Ross, on her
way into port from sen, fouled the bark
L. G. Burgess In the stream last night.
The schooner carried away the Burgess'
main rigging and a portion of the head
gear. The two vessels became entangled
in each other's rigging works, and not
until the tug boat Monarch came along
and aided them did they become sepa
rated. The tug took the schooner in tow
at 9 o'clock and hauled her to her an
chorage, where she lav in peace for the
night. . __^ . .

â  - '
Louis James and Frederick Warde,
I tragedians of heavy reputation, and
: Katherine Kidder, the comedy actress. of
"Sans Gene" fame, commenced ,'a' fort
night's engagement in the Columbia The
ater last night in Sheridan's jovial sooial
satire, "The School for Scandal." A large
I and conspicuously well-clothed audience
was In attendance and several episodes in
the, play' were rewarded" by - liberal ap
plause. Messrs. James ar.d Warde were
cast as the brothers Surface, Charlos-and
Joseph respectively; and Miss Kidder, was
the Lady ; Teazle. On the programme this
triple-plated combination was described
Rbmanly as "th" great star triumvirate";
and a. great many persons in the audi
ence who read this and: remembered the
ponderous past of "Warde and' James were
led to expect a weightier performance
i than the one they got. But the prognosti
! cations of the know-it-alls "tallied * only
: slightly with the night's results.' O f.
Mr. Warde, to be sure, played Joseph
i Surface as we expected him to play the
i partâ with huge emphasis and most of
I the obvious tricks of the overactor; but
on the other hand,* Mr. James, who was a
dire failure in comedy last year, played
Charles with astonishing ease and. buoy-
I ancy; and to make prophecy worse, Miss
! Kidder was only palely enjoyable in a
part that every one expected would fit her
closer than- her cuticle. You never can tell
what will happen on first nights. .That's
! the one thing that keeps me from writing
! these notices before instead of after the
ShoW.\:,?7-:r; â â  . : Â»
.However, last night's -disappointment
worked both ways, and there w - as almost
as much to applaud in the performance
as. there was to cavil at. In* the first
place the play was a good oneâ full -of
sparkle and satire and. good nature
human nature, too, and yet so steeped in
the atmosphere of artificiality, that neith
er overacting nor underacting could quite
lose you the fun long as the ball was
kept a-rolling and the manners' of the
period observed. And I must I say here
that in points of costume, deportment and
general stage direction the production
was admirable, It had the atmosphere.
What it lacked was' character; or, in oth
er words, several of the principal actors
Were not equal to their parts. â¢
. From his point of. view I can readily
understand Mr. Warde's conception of
Joseph Surface. He, I am sure, regards
Joseph as the very lago of comedy. And
as Mr. Warde is by nature and "persistent I
cultivation a tragedian of the depest dye,
hfe brings to bear on this transparent
hypocrite of- Sheridan's all â  the arch
subtleties that enshroud the villain In
"Othello." His sollloquys and asides are
deep and sinister; his good-natnre is.of
the kind that promotes goosefiesh in the
gallery. In tact, it was me humor of tne
tragedian all the way through,: which is
just the kind of humor that is not wanted
in the part. â¢ .. ' . . , - '
The only explanation that I oan offer
of Miss Kidder's Lady Teazle-is that she
was overawed at the facts that Richard
Brinsley Sheridan is dead and' that his
comedy Is reckoned a classic. By some
vague perversion of reverence ' the word
"Classic" always seems to frighten actors
Into unholy seriousness. Sheridan; for all
his good style, is perhaps the least pomp
ous of the old satiric playwriters. He
laughed at and with everybody, including
himself. "He affected - the epigram'be
cause that Was a mode of his day, and
also the snuggest way , to say a good
I thing and make It stick. He is indeed an
ideal comedist of manners, who has lived
these hundred years and more to survive
the garbling* and gagging of Mr. Augus
tin Daly and still be good fun for every
body, from your butcher to your banker.
Sheridan was en â  Irishman of Invincible
wit. to his day what thai other Irishman,
Oscar Wilde, once promised to be to ours.
Lady Teazle is a bumptious young.beau
t\* from the country, so enamored-, of
metropolitan* giddiness that * without 'a
passion to her heart she would follow the
fashion even Into the snares of infidelity.
Her exposure is forced upon her; her con
fession Is revenge upon her faithless ac
complice; her repentance is a joke on poor
Sir Peter. .-She is the cream- of satire, a
charming vulgarian, and. there is no real
reason that 1 -can see why Miss Kidder
should,- not play her with something, of
the same spirit of ''sans gene,", "don't
care," - "wot - t'- 'ell," or - whatever you
choose to* call It, with which, she, played
the washerwoman heroine in 7 Sardou's
comedy. Miss -Kidder tries "to' give the
part a dignity which it will not answer
for. In the first quarrel with 'Sir/ Peter
she , roughened up a bit with â¢ delightful
effect, but, in the most of the- rest of. the
performance she superreflned,the role un
til but little of its original spell was felt.
And now to be amiable! Mr. James as
Charles Surface was a positive . 'joy.' : â¢ I
havd never * known ; a man to mend his
ways as Mr. James. has done, since last
we saw him. I complained then, you may
remember, that in .Voice, figure, gesture
and racialism he was , too huge for this
little world. I." even went so far as .to
say;that vaudeville stared him in the
face.; And now he heaps coals. of fire on
my head by playing .Charles Surface with
all the deftness and agility and colloquial
ism of an actor who had never 'roared a
line of Shakespeare in his life and never
trod the rough, rough road and stormed
the. one-night stand. Mr. James' Charles
was the individual success of last night's
performance, and a piece of acting worthy
of anybody's attention. It was clean, quick,
spontaneous workâ instinct with . the
dash and devil-may-care humor of the
part.
Sir Peter was a trifle over-aged, but
played with fair consistency by Harry
Langdon; Miss Aphie James was inade
quate to even the light demands of Ma
ria; and Frank Peters gave a very per
functory version of Sir Oliver. Moses, as
played by Barry Johnstone, was the most
satisfactory of the subsidiary parts: In
truth Mr. Johnstone's work was the best
of the performance; after Mr. James.

Tivoli.
Oscar Weil's three-act comedy opera,
"Suzette," tunefully prolific and har
monically beautiful, opened the week at
the Tivoli last night. The house bills an
nounced that it had been, revived by re
quest. If so. the requesters must have
refrained from attending in big wads, for
the house in some'parts looked as thin as
though it had been bombarded. But the
opera was all right, and went oft with a
snap and a sparkle that were the chief
characteristics of the good work of the
company. Annie Myers as Suzette. Ber
nice Holmes as the Marchioness, Pruette
as the Marquis. Arthur Boyce as Renee
and Stevens. With his game leg. as Cap
tain Vieubec, were the leading spirits of
the sparkling piece, and curtain calls were
frequent. â  * - -

Olympia.
The Olympia has a strong acrobatic act
in Contrail! and Van Gofre. whose clever
work last night seemed to more than
please. Violet Dale is still a card with
her buck and wing dances and coon songs.
There are some ten or more good turns
on the bill. â  *â¢â¢..-* vy-. .--.,
Orpheum.
The Orpheum has an unusually pleasing
bill for this week. Not in many a day has
there been an acrobatic act of the com
edy order at the Orpheum that can com
pare with that of the Schrode brothers,
who come from the Winter Garden, Ber
lin. Not, only is their acrobatic work
good, but the clowning, too often the
weak, point, in such. acts, is of the very
best and really funny. Professor Macart
with his troop of trained" dogs and mon
keys scored a big hit. and well he might,
for this is one of the best and the funniest
acts of its kind .that has. ever been seen
here. The dogs are trained to waltz, do
skirt dances and. lots of other, interesting
i things, while the' monkeys ride bicycles
' and act as propertymen.. bringing, on and
carrying off all the "properties" used In
the act. Stlne and Evans, in a laughable
! sketch entitled "A Frisky Doctor," arc
i another new turn that scored well. The
songs by Miss Evans were particularly
| well received. Of the balance of the bill
j honors are divided between Milton and
Dollie Nobles in "Why Walker Re

after the female prisoners entrusted to

INDELEGADO
SHOT SCLAFINA
IS SELF-DEFENSE
Promptly Acquitted of
the Charge.
DREYFUS CASE WAS QUOTED
MOTHER-IN-LAW CALLED THE
DAUGHTER A TRAITOR.
After a Fey* Minutes' Deliberation the
Jury Found the Defendant Not
Guiltyâ Guarded to His
Home.
When Antonio Sclafina fell dead on
Fishermen's wharf a few brief months
ago, his body riddled with bullets, he was
a martyr q^lone to his own lust for blood.
His slayer, Guiseppe -Indelegado, fired in
self-defense and yesterday afternoon,
after a brief deliberation, the jury im
paneled to try his case set him free.
that he was innocent of willful murder
none doubted, but. the way of the law
must be observed and he was placed on
trial. Special counsel for. the prosecution
was employed, and Assistant District At
torney Soloman made strenuous efforts
to convict him, but without avail.
The close' of the case was dramatic. A
squad of deputy sheriffs formed around
the prisoner when the jury filed in to an
nounce its verdict, and after it had been
rendered guarded Indelegado to his
home. *
Indelegado:s life is in danger. He has
been threatened by friends of the dead
man, and those who know the nature of
his enemies say they will follow him to
the end of the earth to avenge the death
of Antonio Sclafina.
Yesterday the day's proceedings were
taken up in argument. Eugene Bert, spe
cial counsel for the prosecution, made the
opening argument. W. M. Madden for
the defense followed, and Reel B. Terry,
of counsel for the defense; came next.
Mr. Terry made a sharp analysis of the
evidence and his reply to the thrusts of
the prosecution won half the battle. The
wife of the prisoner had supported him
during the ordeal and this was the cause
of comment from the prosecution. i
When her mother, the mother of the
dead man, took the stand she referred
to the daughter as a traitor. This was
seized upon by the prosecution as a point,
but Terry, in his argument, turned the
thrust to the benefit of his client by re
ferring to the loyalty of Madame Dreyfus
to her hUsband, standing by him in' the
face of all the world. * -.-' ' .

After Driving Off Cattle They "Would

â  . ...- : - : ...] , Them.
John Danz, a butcher, was arrested yes
terday afternoon by Detective Cody and
charged with grand larceny.
For some - time past numerous ] com
plaints have been made to the police
concerning the bold operations of a gang
of "rustlers," who have been stealing
cattle from various ranches on the San
Bruno road. On January 24 last John
Tischen, who has a ranch near the Five
mile house, found that twenty-seven head
of cattle had been driven off by the gang.
After considerable trouble he found the
stolen cattle in the public pound, where
they had been taken by the gang. Their
scheme was to raid a ranch, and after
getting away with all the available cat
tle they would drive them to the pound.
After waiting several days, and in case
the cattle had not been claimed by the
owner they would visit the pound, and,
after identifying the cattle as their own,
they would pay the usual fees and drive
them off. It is claimed that they would
then herd them into some convenient cor
ral, where they would be held until the
gang managed to dispose of them. It
happened that Tischen visited the pound
and at once recognized his cattle.
He was compelled to pay $40 for their
release. Convinced that the cattle had
been stolen by the gang, Tischen visited
police headquarters and informed Captain
Bohen of his suspicions.
Bohen detailed Detective Cody on the
case, and after a thorough investiga
tion he became convinced that Danz had
bought the cattle from the gang. Yester
day he found Danz on the San Bruno
road and placed him under arrest. He
was taken to the City Prison, where he
was booked on a charge of grand lar
ceny. On February 3 Tischen had six of
his best cows stolen, and he lost no time
in notifying tne police. After consider
able* trouble Detective Cody found the
carcasses in* Danz's shop, where they had
been sold to him for $100. He claimed
that some stranger, who was on horse
back, sold him the cattle, and he, after
killing them, arranged with a butcher
named Stone, who has a shop on Sixth
street, to buy them. The police are sat
isfied that an organized gang of "rust
lers" have been stealing cattle, and to
day efforts will be made to apprehend
them. * ' -â¢'â ; '*'-}â 'â .
MARRIED TWO SISTERS.
John Green, an ex-Soldier, to Be Ar
i rested on a Charge of Bigamy.
7 John Green, an ex-soldier, will have to
answer a charge of bigamy, as he is ac
cused of marrying two sisters. He ap
peared before Acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday on' another charge and Prose
cuting Attorney Carpenter elicited the in
formation that Green had married Lizzie
Lunney, 147 Thirteenth* street, by contract
! six and a half years ago. She was not
then 14 ' years â  of age and has since been
the mother of six children, four of whom
are v dead. â¢ .'
I When the war broke out Green became
a soldier and was discharged about two
weeks ago. A few days later he took
his wife's sister, Maggie. 17 years of age,
to Oakland and married her. Now the
contract wife will swear to a warrant for
his arrest on the charge of bigamy, as he
refuses to support her and her children.

An Error Corrected.
In a recent, issue of The Call it was
stated that two men charged with being
"crooks," named Pat and Albert Denis,
were arrested in a â¢ lodging house at 17
Howard street. This was an error, as
the arrests were made at 717 Howard
street. The first figure was inadvertent
ly omitted from the number, causing the
mistake.

â  BAN JOSE, Feb. 6.â There will be a
meeting of the depositors of the Union
â¢ â¢Savings Bank at 10 lock to-morrow
morning to discuss the affairs of the
7 defunct Institution and decide on such
..". action as may be deemed proper to pro
'". .teet the Interests of those whose say- I
..- Ings are tied up In the hank vaults or
l-.-tiave been loaned out to speculators on
;.' doubtful security. A large number of'
â¢j the. depositors probably will be repre- j
:*' sented at the meeting, and a lively time j
â¢ ls expected, as a great deal of bitter
7 .-feeling is being manifested against'
.* .those who are held responsible for the j
failure. Among the more radical of \
\ those who have lost by the closing of
> ; the hank there is a loudly expressed j
*.- desire to bring the matter before the !
. Grand Jury, which is now in session, to j
"secure indictments against the officers j
â 'â  and directors of the institution.
* In view of the fact that the Bank j
-'â Commissioners have so far found noth- i
â¢ ing criminally wrong with the manage- I
â¢ "menf of the bank it Is hardly likely that
any steps In this direction will be taken
at. this stage of the proceedings, Many !
I 'of the depositors have already placed
! their claims In the hands of attorneys,
â  â¢'and when the proper time arrives ac- |
' .tions against the stockholders, mdi- !
vidually, will be commenced.
There are no developments of a sen
" sational nature In connection with the
7 failure, but at the same time there Is
â  little to give encouragement to the
.:' creditors of the institution. H. Ward
â¢ Wright, the ex-president of the bank, i
â¢ continues to assert that the bank will
.pay dollar for dollar of its Indebtedness,
but In view of previous statements
made by this gentleman, which have
'.been proved to be somewhat at variance
with the facts In the esse, his asser
tions are not particularly reassuring.
Since the closing of the bank Mr.
Wright has succeeded In entangling
â¢himself in a maze of contradictions, his
â¢effortH to extricate himself from which
huve only resulted in his further en
tanglement.
I: When the Bank Commissioners Issued
their statement concerning the affairs
of the Institution, of which Wright was
the head, Mr. Wright declared the re
port was full of Inaccuracies and gross
ly exaggerated. He even went so far
as to say thai the bank had transacted
no business whatever with the Jersey i
Landing Tract, which the Commission
ers' report showed to be indebted to
... the bank to the extent of nearly $21,000
â¢â  on an overdraft. The Jersey Landing
Tract, whose assets are said to consist
of about 4000 acres of land which Is I
â¢ Ily under water, ls composed of W. |
;H. and I*'. V. Wright, brothers of the
â banker, the former of whom succeeded
*!H. Ward Wrleht as president of the
Union Savings Bank when the latter 1
resigned after the collapse of the In
stitution.
Mr. Wright now admits that the fig
ures given in the commissioners' report i
â¢ are substantially correct, but he says
the 4000 acres of swamp land are ample
Becurity and that the matter will be i
straightened out as soon as W. H. I
Wright returns from the East.
There has been a great deal of com
ment on the fact thai J. F. Devendorf
was Indebted to the bank to the extent
of over J-5,000. Mr. Wright says the
bank holds an security for this amount
a tract Of land In Stockton worth $75,
--000 and two tracts Of 100 and v., acres
â¢ respectively, near Gilroy. .Mr. Deven
.Â«Jorf says differently. According to him
the Stockton property is the only secu
rity hold by the bank, and while Mr.
Devendorf considers that to be sufil
. clcnt to protect the bank from loss he
1s more moderate in his estimate of its
value than Is the banker.
-. -Mr. Wright announced several days
; ago that he was preparing a signed
â¢ statement of his connection with the
' bank, which he claimed would show j
.â¢ that others were equally to blame with â 
him In the reckless loaning of the funds \
â¢to Irresponsible speculators. The dlrec- '
'tors finally convinced him that it would j
.not be for his own Interests to make the i
threatened exposure, and the statement I
will not be made. j
Wright now claims the bank has in I
its hands nearly 100 Carloads of fruit i
as security for the money advanced to (
E. B. Howard, and he expressed the be
lie! that a great deal of money would
be realized from this source, He does !
.- not venture to gl*v> figures, but says he I
thinks probably r>o percent, of the
amount owed by Howard tO the bank
will be recovered. This, together with
the mortgage on growing corps held by
the bank, will, in his opinion, go a long
way toward paying oil' the claims of de
positors, provided, of course, no unfa
vorable weather Injures the crop pros- j
'pects.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. Owing to
the cold weather the crowd was slow
In filling up the tents at the horse show,
although this was the last day of the
exhibition. All the regular patrons were
In attendance and those who prefer to
stand on promenade instead of sitting j
down were out in force.

REPATRIATION OF
SPANISH SOLDIERS
Philippine Army Will Be Sent
Home With All Possible
Dispatch.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Before
making a formal contract for the re
patriation of Spanish troops In Manila,
the War Department Is awaiting ad-'
vices as to their number from General
Otis. That officer has been sent two
messages asking him to wire the num
ber of Spaniards who wish to be sent
home, but It ls presumed that the con
flict with the natives has prevented a
reply. Just as soon as the Information
la received the contract will be entered
Into with the Campagnla Transatlan
tic It having been found to have
submitted the lowest bid. It win be
urged to send Its steamers as quickly
as possible to Manila, so that the troops
ma" be out of the city without delay.
It is recognized by the War Depart
ment that the presence of such a largo
number of Spaniards is a menace to the
American troops. Besides, it is pointed
out that Otis finds It necessary to detail
a strong force to guard them and pre
vent an outbreak, which might be dis
astrous. There are thought to bo
about 14,000 Spaniards, and should they
repossess themselves of their arms and
ammunition Otis' force- would have a
difficult task of it fighting enemies
without and enemies within the city.

DECISION OF ANGELLOTTI
: TRUSTEE A. SYLVA SHRILLS A
DEFIANT NOTE.
t Sausalito Must Suffer From ''Touts"
and '"Mudhens" Because Property
Owner Noble Suffered No
Specific Injury.
Special DUpatch to Tho Call.
-SAN RAFAEL, Feb. Through a
mere legal technicality the gambling
cohorts of Sausalito have virtually
scored another triumph over those sub
urban residents who object to the daily
presence of a Â»horde of race-track
"touts" and "mtldhens," whose actions
have already given the town a mal
odorous reputation and caused it to de
preciate, rapidly in value as a summer
resort. The demurrer to the petition of
H. H. Noble for an injunction restrain
ing William Harrison and Joe Harvey
from operating poolrooms, on the
ground that they constituted a public
! nuisance, was sustained to-day by the
; decision that a specific instance of in-
Jury to property had not been proved.
Noble, who is a well-known citizen of
Sausalito, filed a complaint against the
poolroom men and the property owners
in whose buildings the bets are laid on
Eastern races as long ago as last Oc
tober. He asked for an injunction on
j the grounds that gambling resorts were
| a public nuisance and were causing
property values to depreciate. It was
I alleged that owing to the proximity of
! his own property to the gaming re
sorts he suffered more on account of
' their presence than did the majority of
citizens and that the presence of tho
riffraff of the metropolis was a men
j ace to ladies and tended to contaminate
j the youth of the community.
A demurrer was interposed and tho
! case taken under advisement by Supe
-1 rior Judge F. M. Angellotti /fast Mon
i day. He sustained the demurrer to-
I day on the ground that the complaint
| did not establish the fact that Noble'l
| property had received specific Injury,
!as required by law. The anti-poolroom,
forces have ten days' time ln which tO
I amend their complaint, but It In *"*
--lieved Improbable that they will do no,
as so many legal technicalities favdf
i the other side. Judge AngHlottl con
| sldered nothing but the case In its legal
[ aspects and a virtual triumph Is there-
I by accorded the gamblers and Trustee
I Sylva, who has openly boasted that
' even the passage of Atherton's bill
; would not prevent the poolrooms carry-.
j ing on their ruinous traffic.

NEGRO DEFEATS WHITE.
Result of a Jamaica Election Causes
Dissatisfaction.
KINGSTON. . Jamaica. Feb. 6.â At the

\ representative for St. Elizabeth, a full
blooded negro was elected over a white
candidate. This is causing much trouble,

On March 19, 1890, he became Chan
cellor, in succession to Prince Bismarck.
He established his fitness to be the suc
cessor of the "Man of Blood and Iron"
in many ways, notably in his exploit of
revolutionizing the commercial system
of central Europe. This he accomplished
in the incredibly short space of one
month. His system was based practi
cally upon a new series of commercial
treaties which laid the foundation for
a Central European customs union. He
abandoned the older system of strict
protection. The new treaties include
the members of the triple alliance and
several other nations.
Caprivl also labored to further the
Kaiser's desire for a powerful army. He

SIX TIME-LUCK
CHEATED DEATH
Stockton Police Officer's
Close Call. ,
CRIMINAL RESISTS ARREST
CARTRIDGES IN HIS REVOLVER
FAIL TO EXPLODE.
Repeatedly Pulls the Trigger, but by
Some Strange Chance the Pa
trolman's Life Is
Spared.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Feb. 6.â Six defective
copper caps were all that stood between j
Policeman John Craig and death last j
night. His escape was most miracu- !
lous. It is seldom that a fully loaded
Colt's six-shooter in the hands of a des
perate criminal is snapped six times
against a man's back and no life for
feited.
Shortly after 11 o'clock last night Mrs.
Thomas Dinell reported to the police
office that her husband was drunk and
had been beating her and had threat
ened her life. She was afraid to return
home, and asked the officers to arrest
Dinell. Officer Craig was sent to bring
the man in. When within a half block
of the place Craig heard the snapping
of a revolver behind him. He turned
and saw Dinell creeping up behind him
and snapping his revolver at him as he
advanced.
The officer drew his own weapon and
ordered Dinell to throw up his hands.
', For an answer . the desperado snapped
the revolver again. Craig then pulled j
the trigger of his own weapon. It |
snapped. Dinell started to run, and the
officer pursued him, calling on him to
surrender. The desperado continued to
run, and Craig shot, but fired high.
Craig fired again, and Dinell dropped,
apparently killed.
As the officer bent over him the fel
low turned and snapped his revolver
full in Craig's face. The patrolman
then took the weapon away from Dinell
and ordered him to come with him.
Dinell Is a small man, and Craig
thought it useless to put handcuffs on
him. Suddenly the desperate man start
ed to fight. The officer reached for his
handcuffs, and as he did so, Dinell
wrenched himself free and started to
run. The policeman broke a heavy cane
over his head, but Dinell ran on, and
before Craig could draw his revolver
Dinell had disappeared in the darkness.
Craig supposed that Dinell had been
making a bluff with an empty revolver
until he examined the weapon. When
he saw the six big loads in it his heart
stood still. t'yy yy-.yy-y
Dinell is an ex-convict. It is now
thought that he is one of the crooks
that have been committing recent bur
glaries, as he answers the description
of one of the housebreakers.
The officer retained Dinell's overcoat
and revolver, a murderous Colt's 44,
nearly a foot in length. It contained
six long cartridges. The caps showed
that the heavy hammer, had fallen on
each of them. ___!__-

"Why Difficulty Is Experienced in Ob

SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 6.â Twenty-five
men out of a venire of thirty took the
stand In the Superior Court to-day and
were immediately disqualined from acting
as jurors on account of having formed a
positive opinion that young Victor Colwell
is guilty of the crime of highway rob

ders for another venire of forty, out of
which It is hoped the remaining seven
jurors can be selected, and to continue the

Attorney Cochrane will try to prevent
the young bandit being sent to San Quen

him for everybody believes that if he had

It is claimed that if he is insane ins in

PARIS PRESS OK
THE OUTBREAK
Aguinaldo's Act De
clared a Blunder.
FRANCE GIVES NO SYMPATHY
FIRST RIFLE SHOT MODIFIED
THE SITUATION.
Such a Clever Maneuver, Says
La Liberte, That General Otis
May Have Inspired the
Flan. Himself.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by Jam-is Gordon
Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. Not much surprise is
manifested here at the outbreak of hos
tilities in the Philippines. For a long
time it has been felt that a clash was
inevitable. The Autorite this morning
referred to the matter, saying it can j
hardly be likely that America will find
the colonies a lighter burden than they
i had proved to Europe.
La Liberte looks upon Saturday's at
tack as the biggest blunder Aguinaldo
could have committed. It was the only i
! way to lose the important mi
i terests he had at stake and to alien
| ate the indirect alliance he had found
1 in America in the anti-Imperialist par
! ty. It was evident that the Americans i
did not dare attack him for fear j
!of exposing themselves to the re- j
I proach of imposing by force of arms '
j their rule on a people to whom they I
I want to offer independence. The pro- |
â¢ longation of this expectant attitude ;
j might have forced the Washington Gov- |
! ernment to make agreements which ]
would have Insured, if not immediate- '
ly at least at some date to be deter
mined upon in the near future, the
recognition of the republic.
The first rifle fired on Saturday night
completely modified the situation, so j
much so that one may ask if the plan ,
of this battle did not have as its origin
a clever maneuver of Otis, who thus
succeeded in getting himself attacked
by sending well-trained spies to act in
the Filipinos' camp. The conclusion
the Liberte draws is that there can no
longer be any question of Philippine
Independence.
The Journal dcs Debats has a leader
which says: "They will say to the
United States parliament as they could
have said to ours, that the flag was
involved. Just as we in France have
seen governments dominated by firms
of responsibility, hastily demand credits
in similar circumstances and indiffer
ent and timid Chambers grant them
immediately, we shall doubtless see j
, McKinley do violence to his nature and
j take a decisive step, and many Ameri
can Senators rally to the expansionist
policy. The independence of the Fili
pinos who asked for liberty must, ac
cording to the sense of justice in the
United States, appear far more respect
: able to Americans than that of Fili
pinos who attempt to gain it by force.
j The defiance Is a singular blunder on
| the part of the weaker,. and that is why
i we think that Aguinaldo's government.
: of which, perhaps, one cannot expect
better, committed yesterday Its blun
der." _______________________
FUTURE POLICY
FOR PHILIPPINES
Resolution Before the
Senate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â This was a
day of excitement and severe strain in
the Senate, owing to the fact that the
peace treaty was to be voted upon, and
\ that the result was hanging in the bal
ance served to keep Senators on both
sides Of the chamber at a high ten
sion. When the Senate convened at
\ noon more members were present than
; had been in attendance upon any ses
sion of the Senate since it assembled
in December.
Allen of Nebraska addressed the Sen
ate in the morning hour in favor of the
ratification of the treaty, but in oppo
sition to expansion. In the course of
his speech he adverted to some news
paper comment upon himself and made
explanations of his position.
Clay of Georgia occupied a few min
utes in explaining why he proposed to
support the treaty.
Gorman (D.) of Maryland followed
with a notable speech, in the course
of which he took Wolcott (R.) of Colo
-1 rado severely to task for some state- j
ments in the latter's speech a few days
j ago in which Gorman thought reference
â¢ was made to him. He explained that
he had not now and had never had
Presidential aspirations, the newspaper
reports to the contrary notwithstand
j ing. His attack upon the treaty was
| one of the most severe made during the
i debate.
After the ratification of the treaty the
Senate in open session took up a joint
: resolution offered by McEnery (D.) of
; Louisiana, declaring a policy for the
i Philippines, and an effort was made to
I adopt it, but the debate occupied so
i much time that the resolution went

The resolution in full follows:

Washington, Feb. 6.
Telegrams fiom Californiansâmoth
ers, fathers and relatives of soldiers in
Manila â thick and fast to vari
ous members of the California delega
tion to-day, making anxious inquiries
as to official reports of casualties. The
morning papers had reported that Pri
vate Dewar was killed and Lieutenant
Hogan, Sergeant Wall and Privates
Scheren and Mahr wounded. Official
advices from General Otis placed Pri
vates Dewar, Thomas Bryan and
Mahr in . the list of killed, but the
names of Hogan, Scheren and Wall
were not included in the list of
wounded.
At 11 o'clock to-night Adjutant Gen
eral Corbin said to The Call corre
spondent that no further list of casual
ties had been received, nor had any
further important dispatches from Ma
nila.
The "War Department seems unwill
ing to have the whole truth of the sit
uation made public, as., was made ap

sage from Colonel Thompson came.
The dispatch, as it was received, con

rebels, however, escaped into the
brush in the rear of the church.
The Americans captured fifty
three of the rebels, and during
ke fighting about the church
twenty of the rebels were killed.
Some 2500 women, children
and non-combatants were allow
ed to enter the American lines,
after promising to go to the
houses of friends and remain
there.
Another intensely exciting in
cident occurred during the en
gagement. - The Washingtons
and Idahos and Companies X
and M of the Californians made
charges across the rice fields be
tween Paco and Santa Ana, in
the face of a terrific fusillade. The
ground to-day over which they
passed is covered with dead and
wounded natives. The former
are being buried in groups of five
or six about where they lay, and
j the latter are being brought to
the hospital. It was at this stage
of the fighting and at Caloocan
that the natives suffered their
heaviest loss.
The Fourteenth reg
ulars were in a par
ticularly tight place
near Singalon, and
Colonel Duboce was
compelled to rush
past them with the
reserve in order to
prevent the regulars
being cut off. In the
last line twelve men
were killed before the
rebels retired.
Both sides cheered frequently
during the engagement. The
American "hurrahs" were almost
invariably met by derisive
"vivas." Among the natives the
Ygorotes were especially notice
able for their bravery, about 700
of these naked savages facing ar
tillery fire with their bows and
arrows. The scene at Manila,
when* the alarm was given on
Saturday night, was wildly ex
citing. The American soldiers
in the theaters and at the circus
were called out, the performances
were stopped, Filipinos scurried
every which way and the rattle of
musketry and booming of can
non outside the city was plainly
heard. The residents of the out
skirts of Manila flocked into the
walled city with their arms full of
articles. All the carriages disap
peared as if by magic, the street
i cars were stopped, the telegraph
! lines were cut and the soldiers
j hurriedly . but silently marched
j out of the city into the stations
assigned them. The stores were
stated that our lines had been badly
cut up and broken before the insur
gents were finally beaten back. This
message was carefully edited, how
ever, and the alarming part of it had
been eliminated when it reached the
newspaper men.
At 12:30 o'clock Secretary Alger called
at the "White House and held another
brief conference with the President.
He said when leaving that he believed
fighting had ceased. All the circum
stances, he said, tended to indicate that
only one battle had been fought and
that General Otis had the situation well
in hand. The fact that General Otis
cabled that the insurgents had been
driven back and the American lines
extended showed clearly, he , thought,
no second attack had been made.
In reference to the report published
in New York that General Otis had
been instructed to carry fighting within
the insurgents' lines and crush Aguin
aldo, Secretary Alger was very em
phatic in its denial.
"I have not sent any communication
to General Otis since I asked him for
a list of the casualties," he said. "Gen
eral Otis is in command there and he
knows what to do. To give him any
instructions or orders before he has
asked a question would be to do that
which would lose more battles than
gallant fighting could gain, and we
have not done it." *v--..yy:v.y
closed. almost instantly. Foreign
flags were to be seen flying from
many windows and a number of
white rags were hung out from
Filipino huts and houses.
On Sunday immense crowds
of people visited the water front
and gathered in the highest tow
ers to watch the bombardment.
There were no streetcars or car
riages to be seen and the streets
were almost deserted. The Min
nesota troops, acting as police,
searched every native and arrest
ed many of them with the result
that while there were several at
tempts to assassinate American
officers on Saturday, there, were
none on Sunday. Absolute or
der was maintained.
The United States flagship
Olympia steamed across the bay
on Sunday and took up a posi
tion near the German cruiser
Irene and the British cruiser
Narcissus, off the mole. She is
still there. The Americans are
determined not to give the Fili
pinos a chance to recuperate.
The official list of dead and
wounded has not yet been sub
mitted for publication and it is
impossible, owing to the fact that
; the regiments are scattered, to
obtain a reliable list, except from
headquarters.
Two Filipino commissioners
from Iloilo and four rebel officers
were arrested here this morning,
after boarding the steamer
Uranus. Many suspects J have
been arrested in various parts of
the city.
CONFLICTING VIEWS
CAUSED BY DEWEY'S
LATEST DISPATCH
Alger Does Not Believe That
Fighting Was Renewed,
While Naval Officials
Differ,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.-Secretary Alger came over to the White
House at 12:30 o'clock and left a half hour later. While with the Presi
dent a dispatch was received from General Otis giving a list of the cas
ualties at the engagements yesterday and Saturday night . The Secre
tary said he did not interpret Admiral Dewey's dispatch this morning as
showing that the fighting is now in progress. He thought it was filed
early in the engagement and had been delayed in transmission If the
battle had been in progress when General Otis filed his casualty dispatch
this morning, he felt sure he would have mentioned the fact: Alger said
further that, contrary to the statements made in some newspapers this
morning, he had not sent General Otis a word of instructions as to what
he should do. "He is on the ground." said the Secretary, "and it would
be folly for us here to undertake to direct his movements. Many battles
have been lost by such unwise interference, and twe shall leave the mat
ter to his and Admiral Dewey's judgment. We have confidence in their
discretion."
Naval officials felt sure that Dewey's dispatches had not been invert
ed and that there had been more fighting. Of the outcome they had little
doubt, pointing out that Dewey's guns command the entire city and the
approaches beyond, affording a most satisfactory backing for General.
Otis' operations.
â  7'- As between these varying views, there must be taken into considera
tion the opinion of ; the Filipinos attached to the junta here' to the effect
that the attack of Saturday night 7 . was precipitated by the unexpected
killing of a Filipino by an American guard, and that 'the result was to
bring on an action at the weakest part of the Filipino lines. 7
If this opinion is well founded, it would seem to be ', possible that the
naval view is correct, and that the Filipinos have now begun action at
their strongest point, namely, ; between Manila and Malolos, the insurgent
capital, about fifteen miles distant from Manila. B-9__-ft_________B__
DRAWS A LESSON
FROM THE FIGHT
Professor Yon Hoist's
Warning.
FRUITS OF IMPERIALISM
MANILA BATTLE A FORETASTE
OF NEW DANGERS.
First Departure From the Nation's
Traditions Has Already
Led to Shedding, of
.;. .yl iVt.i^'y â â 
Blood.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. .; , Professor yon
Hoist, in his lecture at the University
of Chicago to-day, took for his text the
recent happenings in Manila and issued
a warning to the people of the United
States that it was but a foretaste of the
dangers that would surely attach to a
plunge into the maelstrom of imperial
ism, toward which the nation now
seems to be sweeping in spite of the
efforts of all thoughtful men.
"The battle which has just taken
place probably will have the ef
fect the Maine explosion had," said the
professor. "I never doubted ratifica
tion would come ultimately, but now,
I fear, we, the minority, will be over
ridden in the stampede and will not
get the desired time for deliberation.
"First, I propose to tilt my lance
against what I believe to be an exceed
ingly weak part in the armor of my
adversaries, while most, if not all, the
expansionists evidently think it the
strongest part. President McKinley
has put the argument into epigram
matic form. His saying 'Destiny de
termines duty' has been exultantly
hailed as striking the very keynote of
the situation confronting us and point-,
ing us more unerringly than the needle
points to the pole to the policy we have
to pursue, whether or not.
"In my opinion (I say it with due
respect) the saying is very nice and a
clever bit of alliteration, but that is
all the merit there is to it. As an axiom,
intended to serve as a fingerpost in
practical politics, it is worse than
worthless. It is in the highest degree
harmful, because instead of sober and
sound thinking a vague-sounding
phrase is made to point the way â a
vague-sounding phrase eminently fit to
serve as stately, nay, as a gorgeously
dazzling cloak to any vagaries.
"We declared War when Spain, after
yielding to our every demand, finally re
fused to do what, as far as I remember
now, no self-respecting nation in re
corded history has ever refused
to relinquish at our bidding a large and
valuable part of her rightful national
domain. Still, I believe that the body
of our people was sincere in the pro
testation that war was to be waged, not
for selfish ends, but in a truly and
grandly altruistic serving the
holy cause of justice, liberty and hu
manity.
"Our noble intentions broke down
before the onset of temptations precipi
tated upon us by Spain's weakness. We
not only took whatever we could lay
our hands on, but, with a grand spurt
of the imagination, the like of which is
not to be found in all recorded history,
we claimed to have conquered 2000 isl
ands, while, as a matter of fact, we
had possession of only one city In one
of them. A bigger â¢ dog was never
wagged by a smaller tail. Spain, hav
ing practically not a ship or a dollar
left' with which to continue the war,
had of course to yield to the perempr
tory demands of the President's Peace
Commissioners, to cede not only all we
had actually conquered, but all we pre
tended to have conquered.
"The constitution is the sheet anchor
of the republic, and if we stand fast
to the letter and spirit of that great in
strument, we as a nation cannot go far
wrong. Already we have paid in blood
shed in the environs of Manila too
dearly for the first departure from the
teachings of the fathers. These are
signs of the times boding us no good.
Though all the luscious fruit should be
garnered which the enthusiasm of the
expansionists expect to reap from the
new departure, the spirit manifested in
these things cannot with impunity be
allowed to take root with our people.
"The republic rests on a foundation
of sand and the waves of time will
wash :it down, all the more certainly
the larger its population, the greater Its
wealth, the more irresistible its power
becomes, if the nation's destiny be not
implicitly ruled by the deliberate judg
ment and the conscious will of the peo
ple at large, based upon calm reflection
and nursed to maturity by full, un

GREAT RELIEF TO
THE PRESIDENT
Had Doubted Passage of
â¢ Peace Treaty.
NO NEED FOR EXTRA SESSION
BUT APPROPRIATION BILLS ARE
GREATLY DELAYED.
Many Measures Which Members of
Both Houses of Congress Are
Anxious to Have Con
i sidered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 6.
The ratification of the treaty of peace
is a great relief to President McKinley,
who has been anxious and worried
about its fate. For the past week he
had been given to understand by lead
ing supporters of the Administration in
the Senate that it was extremely doubt
ful whether it could muster a two-third
vote. Yesterday he was encouraged to
believe that the news from Manila, de
plorable as it was by reason of the loss
of our soldiers, would at least have the
effect of ratifying the treaty. But this
morning the outlook was gloomy
enough to its supporters. Senator Piatt
telephoned to the White House his opin
ion that the treaty was doomed to de
feat.
The greatest interest, . not to say
anxiety, was manifest in the Senate
chamber when the vote was taken to
day. The galleries were crowded and
on the floor were many Representatives
who had come over from the House
wing to witness the proceedings.
True to "his announced intention, Sen
ator Perkins voted for the treaty. Sen
ator White was paired with Proctor and
Wetmore.
There is no excuse for an extra ses
sion, and there will be none probably,
although Allison in the Senate and Can
non in the House have warned their
legislative associates if they wished to
avoid an extra session it is absolutely
necessary that appropriation bills must
be disposed of with greater rapidity.
Not for twenty years have these meas
ures been more backward. It is under
stood that the gentlemen who want to
press other legislation, such as the
steamship bill, anti-scalping and distri
bution of appropriation bills among va
rious Senate committees, do not seem
inclined to yield.
Hepburn is also very anxious "to pass
a substitute for the Senate's Nicaragua
canal bill. General Grosvenor says that
it will stir up a lively contention be
tween the two branches of Congress.
He thinks that some sort of legislation
is imperative this session, but it is
doubtful if the Senate will consent to
have Its bill ripped to pieces.
SHOULD FOLLOW
UP THE VICTORY
General Merritt Says Another De
cisive Blow Would End
the Insurrection.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â General Wes
ley Merritt, in an interview to-day on
the Philippine outbreak, said:
"That the attack on our lines should
have been made at night is what one
would expect from the tutelage of the
Filipinos in warâ of the Spaniards..
Night attack is a favorite operation of
Spanish commanders, and during the
time that the insurgents were besieg
ing Manila before our movement
against the city actively began the two
antagonists used to shoot liberally at
! each other in the dark and during the
day remain quiet. Their common prac
tice, moreover, when fighting in
trenches, is to thrust their rifles over
the top of the breastwork without ex
posing any part of the body and trust
to luck to hit something.
"The night attack as a regular method
of warfare characterizes the art of war
in a low stage of development. Sol
diers trained in the best schools of mod
ern military science prefer, as a rule, j
to fight their battles in daylight, since
then there is less chance of mistake
and a greater opportunity of working
out with mathematical precision. The
chiefs of a semi-civilized force, from
the Khalifa to Aguinaldo, prefer a
dash in the dark, hoping to terrorize
the enemy by the unexpectedness of
their attack. .:';â¢*
"Without doubt the insurgent as
sault on Manila was preconceived and
deliberate. That it was planned by
Aguinaldo I do not care to assert, but,
of course, the patent probability is
that it was, since he has lately seemed
to be undisputably supreme. The blow
which we have been compelled to de
liver ought now, in my judgment, to
be vigorously followed up. If it is. the
Filipinos will quickly realize who is
master and submit.
INSURGENTS SAY
HIOS ARMED THEM
MADRID, Feb. 6.â Dispatches from
Manila describe a conference between
General Otis and Aguinaldo. some days
back, at which, when Aguinaldo learned
of the "intention of the Americans to
attack and capture Iloilo and other
ports," he declared he would begin hos
tilities if the United States sent any
reinforcements to the Philippines. The
conference "failed to arrive at any
understanding."
According to the same dispatches it
would seem that the insurgents lack
ammunition, as they have been seek
ing to purchase it everywhere and have
been offering high prices. They recent
ly gave it out that General Rios had
delivered to them 5000 Mauser rifles
and. 3,000,000 cartridges in exchange for
prisoners, but this General Rlos denies.
STORM SEWER FOR
CEMETERY CREEK CANYON
OAKLAND'S COUNCIL APPROPRI
ATES $50,000 FOR THE WORK.
Bills of the Two Water Companies
Referred Back to the
Board of â  Public
Works.
. OAKLAND, Feb. 6.â After a heated de
bate, lasting until almost midnight, the
Cost of Nicaragua Canal.
The estimates as to the cost of constructing
the ; Nicaragua canal vary . from 8115,000,000 to
8150,000,000. ' How different :'j are ; the estimates
of. the people as to the value of Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters for stomach, liver, blood and
kidney diseases. It is agreed everywhere that
this : remedy I ls unsurpassed . for indigestion,
biliousness, constipation, nervousness . and
sleeplessness. , It ls such an agreeable medicine**'
to take. It tastes good as well as does good.
City Council to-night passed to print an
ordinance, introduced by Brosnahan, ap
propriating $50,000 for the construction of
a storm sewer in Cemetery Creek Canyon,
from Twenty-fourth street to the city's
northern boundary, the money 'to be
taken from the sewer fund of the fiscal
year 1899-1900. Councilmen Cuvellier,
Rowe and Upton voted negatively, stat
oing that th**ey were not in favor of ap
propriating moneys to be realized from
taxes levied by future Councils. The
third report of the commissioners for the
open of a street through Cemetery
Creek was ap- ived, the protest being
overruled.
The exorbitant bills of the Contra Costa
and Oakland "Water companies, aggre
gating $1849, which have been the subject'
of much discussion heretofore, were re
ferred back to the Board of Public
Works. The resolution conveying such
order calls the board's attention to sec
tion 158 of the city charter, which pro
vides that no such bill can be paid by
the City Council until the Board of Pub
lic Works has first approved the same.
Councilman Woodward explained that
his recent declination to vote on these
bills was based upon the fact that the
Council had no jurisdiction ln the mat
ter.
A protest against constructing a sewer
in Twenty-third street, from West to
Brush streets, and from West to Twenty
second street, was overruled, while the
protest against remacadamizing Filbert
street, from Tenth to Twelfth, was sua-*
tamed. :..'_,-.-â¢ ~

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. -The stock prices were j
extremely variable to-day, but ended with only ,
fractional net changes, the majority of which j
were upward. Many conflicting reports reached j
the street as to the probabilities of confirma- ;
tion or rajection of the peace treaty, and these I
were instrumental in staying values. The first |
effect of the uprising at Manila was discourag- ;
ing. Stocks opened below London parity, and j
there were soon material declines in a number j
of rases. London sold about 15,000 shares of '
6tock. Traders bought on the decline and j
prices improved. Although dealings were much
contracted compared with recent averages,
prices rose above Saturday's closing. Houses
with Washington connections were wat lied
.narrowly with a view of getting some intima
tion by their dealings as to the treaty's
chances, but no decided tendency one wav or
the other could be detected. Toward midday
the market again worked upward, with minor
periods ef depression, but gradually top figures i
were generally reached. The impression pre- I
vailed in some quarters that the outburst of
the Filipinos assured the treaty's ratification, ;
and on the theory that settlement of the un
certainty would be beneficial, there was buy
ing of stocks. On th.. other hand, many de
cided to reduce their commitments over night
as a precautionary measure, and these con- !
tending interests gave the markets its appear- |
ance of irregularity.
The feverishness wh^h prevailed In the early '
. dealings in a measure gradually disappeared
as the day wore on, and the middle and low- I
priced stocks sympathized In the advancing
tendency of gilt edge stocks. In the final deal
ings there were slight recessions from the best i
prices. -.â-.. ...
The bond market showed marked heaviness in '
the early transactions, but later improved in
spots, closing irregular. Total sales. $4,000,- i

THE LONDON MARKET.
XEW YORK. Feb. 6. -The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was greatly red- la the mar
kets here to-day in view of the heavy settle
ment beginning to-morrow. The tone was dull 1
and Americans opened weak and went Oat on '
the Philippine news and fears of dearer money
In Mew York at the end of the month. There
was a slight rally In the afternoon, but New
fork's apathy caused the market to slump
away and the close was idle and depressed.
London bulls were dejected.
Tintos touched 41 and closed at 40%. Ana- ,
condas reached 'â¢'.. and closed at 9. More
blocks of the certificates have been sold.

METALSâ The week opened with no fefnsa
tional changes in the situation generally and
comparatively narrow adjustments in quota
tions. Spelter alone showed marked strength
to-day. Lead, on the other hand, was a shade
easier, under Increased offerings and a ter- ;
porary withdrawal of import buyers. News I
from the West and abroad was as about us ex
pected and influenced . the market but little.
Many buyers have stocked up quite freely in
copper, tin and â¢ lead within the past three j
weeks and are now inclined to hold off pend- ;
ing further developments. With consumption
running ahead of all previous years, however,
sellers manifested no uneasiness, and at the end â¢
of the day were standing pretty tirmlv by the
rates quoted. At the close the Metal Exchange !

; CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. Early wheat news was
not of a nature to bring in fresh buying orders,
and the market opened weak. Liverpool ca
bles came equal to %c per bushel lower, and
the London markets showed even a greater
decline. The world's shipments the past week '
amounted to about nine million bushels, or two j
million above requirements. May opened He
lower, at 7-%072c, and touched 72>ic. The visi- j
ble statement, when completed, showed 400,000 !
bushels increase, where a decrease had been !
looked for. This caused a general effort to get
rid of Ion? wheat, and, the pressure soon car- :
Tied May off to 71% c. Shorts became active
buyers on the announcement of clearances at '
Atlantic seaboard which amounted to 705,000 i
bushels. In the final dealings, New York re
ported that sixty-eight boatloads had been sold
for export, ar.d that caused more activity in
the buying, the consequence of which was an I
advance in May wheat to 72% c, and 72%Â®72%c |
was its closing price. â¢ _.;' ;..
Corn suffered a little early in sympathy with ]
wheat, but was on the whole remarkably firm. j
Covering by shorts brought about an upturn. !
May closed He higher.
Oats gained He and closed at 2Sc buyers.
Provisions developed an easier tendency at
the start, but later rallied on buying of lard
by English houses and heavy purchases of pork
by pocking houses. Pork rose 7%a10c, lard 7'ic
and ribs sc.

WERE FIRST AT
INGLESIDE TRACK
Golden Rule a Fleet
Youngster.
AN EASY WINNER AT 10 TO 1
.ST. JACOB CAPTURED THE HUE
DLE EVENT.
Jinks Given a Strong Argument by
Strongoliâ Euckwa Outfooted
David Tenny From Start
to Finish.
â â â  Ingleside had a most auspicious reopen
ing day. The weather was perfect, twen
â¢ ty bookmakers chalked up odds, and the
â  He-Ids were well graded. The attendance,
â though, showed a slight falling off. The
favorites fared well, taking all but two
-â events.
v" In the two-year-old scramble, Ed Corri
gan sent a likely looking youngster to the
:-post in Golden Rule, a son of Golden Gar
'â ter. The books quoted him at S and "10
; to 1, at which odds he was fairly well
' played. "Skeets" Martin had the mount,
â¢and beating the barrier, won all the way.
...Bona finished second by a narrow mai-
Sin over Mountebank. There was no pro
' nounced choice in the betting.
Another unexpected happening was the
â victory of St. Jacob, in the mile and a
â  furlong hurdle affair. Monita, with T.
. Murphy in the saddle, was a cinchy sort
of favorite, and cut up great capers to
â¢the stretch. There Daly, on St. Jacob,
â '"let his horse down, and the old "lepper
forged to the front, winning well In hand
by half a length. The Montana delega
tion, it is said, made quite a clean-up.
â¢ A cheap-looking set of platers faced the
webbing in the opening live and one-half
â  furlong spin. The Corrigan entry. Alaria.
. was iiamniufd down from 5 to 2 to 3 to
2, and never left the result in doubt. El
sin was second, a length before Sevoy.
For a time it looked as if Jinks had
.found more than her match in the six
.' furlong dash, third on the card. Pat i
Dunnes filly was so highly thought of
that 2 to '< was the ruling price at post
rail. At the start the lumbering Strongoll '
shot to the front, and not until the pad
dock was reached did the favorite over
take him. She there slipped to the front,
. winning fashionably, i Strongoli stopped
so badly that he lasted just long enough
to take the place from Balista by a head.
The mile and a furlong: selling run fell
'to Ed Purser's gelding Buckwa. David
â¢ Te^nny, which commanded the call In the
. ring, did not appear to be at himself, and
was headed from start to linish. The
â  winner was backed from ?> to 2 to '> to 5,
while Tenny went back in the betting.
MisUeton led Dare If out for the show.
' â¢ Mary Black, with John Reiff on her
; back, weighing 64 pounds, made a show
:. of her field in the Owners' handicap at
â  live furlongs. She was favorite in the
â .betting, and though Mi:-.--- Rowena ran
. placidly with 100 pounds and Bullman up,
, was unable to extend the Wishard entry.
. Midlight lasted out long enough to beat
â¢ Roaormdnde for show honors.
Track Notes.
Â»_ "Skeets" Martin carried off the saddle
. honors, piloting three winners in clever
fashion. "Skeets" was never riding- in
better form than at the present time.
James Long, who was ruled off some
' years . Ago as the Bay District' track .in
. connection with the running of the horse
. Ricardo, has been reinstated. It is under
stood he will train the horses owned by
â¢- Smith & Tarn.
.' . St. Jacob is said . to have been well

j MRS. BOTKIN APPEALS.
Her Case Formally Carried to the Su
preme Court.
A formal notice of appeal to the Su
preme Court has been filed on behalf of
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. Yesterday morning
a notice of appeal, signed by George A.
Knight. Frank McGowan and C. M.
Wheeler, was presented and a formal stay
of execution for twenty days was grant
ed. The appeal is taken on three pointsâ
from the judgment of conviction, from
the order denying the motion for a new
trial and from the denial of the court
on the motion for an arrest of judgment.
In event the Supreme Court sustains the
various rulings of the lower court and
orders the judgment carried into effect
an appeal will be taken to the Supreme
Court of. the United Btatea. Attorneys
for the defense, however, do not expect
that an appeal will have to be taken to
the court of last resort, and are confident
of winning in the Supreme Court of the
1 State.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1899.
SAYS GENERAL EAGAN
WAS CAUGHT IN A "RUT.'
HC. DE MUTH, ex-lieutenant;
colonel of the Second Mis
â¢: souri Volunteer Infantry,
and a leading citizen of Se
dalia, Mo., ls in this city on busi
ness, and is registered at the Pal
ace. ' '-'. rjr
Colonel tie Muth was encamped
With his regiment at Chickamauga
Park during hostilities, and was in
a position to make many "observa
tions. He stated that the rations
given his regiment were whole
some. "At times," he said, "we
were given rotten beef furnished
by unscrupulous army contractors,
but as soon as we discovered its
condition we simply threw it away.
"While I can't say that General
Kagan was incompetent to fill the
important offlce of quartermaster
general, yet I think he. like other
old army officers, was in a rut, and
when the army was enlarged to
200,000 men he was simply over
whelmed and was unable to cope
with his responsibilities."
In speaking of the lessons taught
the nation by the war. Colonel de
Muth called attention to the care
lessness and incompetency of the
medical department. He thinks
many lives might have been saved
had there been a better system
used in that important* branch of
the sen-ice. The colonel- does not *_^_^_^H__________-*f__*______it_-_g!9_____B-'_____-l
look for any trouble in Cuba on the part of the insurgents. He says all that Â°
the latter want is to be paid for their long service in the field and then be Â£
permitted to disband so that they can return to their former occupations. +
Colonel de Muth is a leading Republican in his section- of the country. O
MYSTERIOUS SMITH
COMING WESTWARD
HE IS MATCHED TO FIGHT THE
CLEVEB ''KID" LAVIGNE.
Beferee White of New York Tells
How Fitzsimmons Punched
Holes in a Fat Hog.
Professor Kennedy, the director general
of the Excelsior Athletic Club, received a
message from "Mysterious" Billy Smith
on Saturday which stated that he (Smith)
was satisfied with the conditions proposed
by "Kid" Lavigne and that he would
leave New York on Sunday evening on a
journey to the West.
Smith expects to arrive in this city on
Friday or Saturday next, and after visit
ing his intimate friends he will locate at
one of the training stations until he is
called upon to try conclusions with the
clever and hard-hitting Lavigne.
The contest, which will consist of twenty
! rounds, will take place In the early part
I of March in Woodward's Pavilion, and
! according to an agreement the contestants
1 must weigh in at 142 pounds at the ring
side. **" yy : y.
Many people are Impressed with the Idea
that Smith cannot reach the weight stipu
lated and be strong, but on this point
there need be no alarm among the friends
of the mysterious light-weight, as Smith
has been leading a very abstemious life
time he joined the benedicts and can
easily fight at 142 or even less If the oc
casion required It. 'â â /â 
Lavigne has been taking light exercise
at Blanken's for the past few days. He
will settle down to a regular course of in
door and outdoor exercise after the ar
rival of his prospective opponent.
Frank Erne' and Dal Hawkins are put
ting on muscle at their respective train
ing quarters. Erne is said to be in tol
erably good condition now, but It is doubt
ful If he will be made a favorite when the
betting days arrive. -
The following story on 1* Itzslmmons Is
told by Charley White, a well known New
*i York referee. He contends that Fitzsim
mons has a penchant for punching holes
in the carcasses of dead animals. At any
rate the White "yarn" makes pretty fair
reading. The following is an extract from
an Eastern paper:
During the days when Fitz had not risen to
his present exalted pugilistic position he was
always on the lookout to test his hitting pow
ers and never overlooked an opportunity to
let fly his" huge fists at some inanimate object.
About four years ago Fitz was in Boston with
White who was then training him for a fight.
Fitz had a mania for hitting with his fists
dressed hogs or sheep hanging on hooks in
front of butcher shops. Nothing pleased him
better than to pass a butcher shop, and, when
the proprietor was not looking, take a smash
at the body of a hog. White, on such occa
sions would be his lookout, and give him the
tip when the coast was clear to pummel the
object. White' told me that whenever Fltz let
drive with his right he would Invariably cut
the flesh of the sheep or hog as clean as a knife
and sink his fist to the ribs. Fitz told White
that this was the nearest approach he could
get to a human being, and was much better
than striking a punching bag. On ona occa
sion Fitz, while walking along with White,
spied a magnificent hog hanging on a hook in
front of a butcher shop whose proprietor had
been annoyed more than once by having the
sides of some of his livestock split by the
brawny fists of .th- blacksmith. The butcher
had been on the alert for some time to catch
the guilty party, so when Fltz took a smash at
his porker and split the flesh as clean as a
knife he seized a cleaver and, with a yell that
would have done credit to a Comanche, he
rushed at Fltz. White, at the first sign of dan
ger, was off like a greyhound, yelling to Fit/,
to run. Fitz, with his heart in his throat, got
up on his toes and tore after White with the
speed of a quarter-horse. ****
The irate butcher pursued the pair for several
blocks, swinging his cleaver like a madman.
A crowd followed at his heels, and there was
the biggest kind of an uproar in the neighbor
hood. The butcher's wind was bad, however,
and Fitz and White, by making use of several
alleys, finally managed to give him the slip.
After this experience Fltz told White that he
thought it best to give up punching the exhib
its of butchers.
* BIG BISK, SMALL GAIN.
A Bold Piece of Extortion Practiced
Upon a Mission Driver.
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals were yes
terday Informed that a person represent
ing himself to be an officer for the so
ciety was extorting money from people
in the Mission. According to the story, he
called upon John Listel, driver of a wagon
belonging to a laundry at 3228 Seventeenth
street, and asserted that the man's horse
was lame, although such was not, the
case. The person demanded $1 for a pre
scription, saying that he would have to
condemn the horse if the money was not
paid. Rather than to have any trouble
the money was handed over and the pre
scription given. â  â¢ '
Yesterday Listel reported the matter to
Mr. Holbrook. secretary of the society,
and handed him the card given by the
person who demanded the dollar. The
card was that of Dr. W. H. Jones, a vet
erinary surgeon who Is located near Sixth
and Harrison streets. As the man who
demanded the money answers the de
scription of Dr. Jones, the advice was
given to have the offender â¢ arrested.
Chief Lees has Instructed Officer Hooper,
who is attached to the society, to look
into the matter, as Dr. Jones is in no way
connected with that body.

Mrs. Ida Quinn, alias Grace Allison,
alias Mrs. Grace Collins, alias Miss Smith,
the aliases being* in chronological order,
experienced an unpleasant surprise yes
terday afternoon when a Deputy United
States Marshal served her and N. C. Col
lins, alias Mr. Smith, who swore that he
was her husband, with the papers in a
suit In the United States Circuit Court
by Dr. Andrew A. Allison of Temple,
Texas, who a^Ks that she be compelled
to surrender three thousand dollars'
worth of jewelry and, clothing which he
presented her for safe keeping pending
their marriage.
The disagreeable part of the prooess was
that the three thousand dollars cash ball
deposited by her and the man who she
swears is her latest, husband has been
attached for the purposes of the suit.
uorse than all. papers of attachment
were served upon Mr. Collins, alias Smith,
who swore that he married Mrs. Quinn,
alias Mrs. Allison, alias Mrs. Collins, alias
Miss Smith, to hold the thirty-seven thou
sand dollars in cash which he swore he
received from his wife when he married
her.
Mr- .Crowley, for the defense in the
swindling marriage bureau case, raised
the point yesterday that the Indictment
was defective in that it did not allege
that the defendants fraudulently used the
mails "with the intent to defraud." He
thereupon asked that the jury be dis
charged and the defendants be allowed
to wend their way thence. But Judge
de Haven, not having his legal micro
scope handy, declined to pass upon the
point at that time and ordered the agony
to proceed, which it did. .
When the young man who acted as spe
cial counsel for Mrs. Ida Quinn. alios
'Â9, race Allison, alias Mrs. Collins,
alias Miss Smith, had concluded with the
reading of a typewritten essay upon the
virtue and honesty of the Quinn, alias the
Allison, alias the Collins, alias the Smith
lady. Judge de Haven adjourned the court
until 11 o clock this morning.

Acting Police Judge Barry Dismisses
the Case Against the Five
Boys in the Mission.
The preliminary examination of Oscar
Wilson, Charles Whit,-. Charles Trolcson,
Charles Burke and Frank Pardini, tlie
five boys charged with attempting to
wreck a train on the Southern Pacific
track between Army and Twenty-sixth
streets last Wednesday morning, was held
before Acting Police Judge Barry yester
day afternoon. Attorney Kelly prose
cuted, and the boys were defended by At
torneys Glover end Caldwell.
Special Officer Madden, who arrested the
boys, testified to seeing them on the track
with a basketful of stones, which was
thrown on the track against one of the
mils. He asked the boys what they were
doing, and they replied they were play
ing. He took them back and made them
remove the basketful of stones from the
track. About a minute afterward a pas
senger train for San Jose passed the
spot. It was possible for the train to have
been derailed if the stones had not been
removed.
Daniel Carmody. gatekeeper at tho
Army street crossing, corroborated Mad
dens testimony, and E. B. Stanwood, con
ductor of the San Jose train, testified to
passing the spot and seeing Madden and
the boys there.
Charles White nnd Oscar Wilson, two
of the boys, testified that they were play
ing Chinaman and had no thought of
wrecking a train. They did not attempt
to run away when Madden came up to
them and told him what they had been
doing. Rev. F. A. Doane testified to the
White boy's good character and said he
was the principal support of a widowed
mother.
The Judge said It was unnecessary to
argue the case and dismissed It.
BESTAUI.ANT WI. TE.
Can a Bootleg Steam Beer Schooner
Be Cchsidred a Wine Bottle
Burt M. Thomas, Special Internal Rev
enue Agent, yesterday notified the keepers
of French and Italian restaurants where
red wine is served with meals that they
must supply their customers with wine
in stamped bottles and that the glass
pitchers and tumblers in which wine is
now being served are merely subterfuges
to evade the payment of the war tax.
Some of the restaurant men said that
they would comply with the order, which
means a tax of 10 cents a gallon on wine
which they buy for 20 cents, and which.
in their estimation, means an oppressive
and discriminating tax of *"0 per cent ad
valorem. Â â  < .
They point to the fact that the saloon
keepers, who sell the same quality and
brand of wine for 5 cents and 10 cents a
glass, or at the rate of from $1 50 to $3
per gallon, arc exempted from the pay
ment of the war tax, and may fill their
bottles as often as they, choose. It is
probable that a test case will be made
to determine the question as to whether
a bootleg steam beer schooner becomes a
bottle when wine instead of beer is put

WATER RATES
TO BE FIXED
IMMEDIATELY
Supervisors Ready for
Action.
WILL MEET TO-MORROW NIGHT
AT WAR WITH TAX COLLECTOR
SHEEHAN AGAIN.
The Latter Will Press His Mandamus
Suit to Compel Payment of
His Clerks' Sal- /.
aries.
The Supervisors are preparing for the
annual struggle over the fixing of the
water rates to which so much scandaf has
attached in recent years. The matter
â which is of so much importance to the
residents of th,is city will be discussed by
the board, sitting as a committee of the
whole, to-morrow night.
Supervisor Phclps, who is chairman of
the Water Committee, made a determined
effort to have the question first considered
by that committee, but this motion was
lost, there being six for and the numt
number against such action. It was the
last matter considered by the board at its
usual weekly meeting yesterday. The de
bate was precipitated by Supervisor Lack
mann moving 'that when the board ad
journed it do so to meet again Wednesday
evening to consider water rates. In re
sponse to a question Mayor Phelan said
that the company was in contempt of the
board at the present time in not having
complied with its request for a complete
statement of its expenses.
Supervisor Perrault asked if in the past
the Supervisors did not have to take
what the water company was willing to
give in the way of information.
To this Mayor Phelan replied innocent
ly: "Other boards have taken all they
could get." The answer created a general
laugh as memories of boodling boards
flashed across the minds of those pres
ent.
Chairman Phelps of the Water Commit
tee claimed the right to conduct the in
vestigation. The Mayor showed him that
in the past it had been the custom tor the
board to consider the matter, and he
doubted if the rate would stand as legal
if fixed by the committee. Supervisor
Perrault reminded his fellow members on
the board that their political future de
pends upon the way they vote on the wa
ter and gas question and they should be
glad to have the burden of resnonsibllity
borne equally by all the members. It was
finally determined to have the investiga
tion by the board in its entirety. The of
ficers of the company will be cited to ap
pear with the books and papers which
will contain the information upon which
the board will fix the rates.
The meeting developed the fact that the
fight between the board and ax Collec-
I tor Sheehan had broken out again. Su
pervisor Perrault asked that the Finance
Committee be empowered to employ spe
cial counsel to defend the board in the
mandamus proceedings brought by the
Tax Collector. Supervisor Phelps thought
that the judiciary committee was the
proper one to employ such men if they
were required. After an extended dis
cussion the Mayor informed the warring
factions that the special counsel fund had
been overdrawn to the extent of JW7 by
the previous board. This put a stop to
the discussion at once. During the dis
cussion Supervisor Perrault told of the in
vestigations he had made in the office of
the Tax Collector to determine the num
ber of clerks he really required. He said
he had come to the conclusion that eight
were sufficient. There was a conflict of
opinion among Mr. Sheehan's deputies,
each giving a different estimate. He un
derstood the mandamus proceedings
would be pressed against the board.
There was a aharij struggle over the re
moval of the corporation yard of the
fatreet Department. It was on the recon
sideration of the resolution causing the
removal. Chairman Aigel tinker or the
Street Committee and Deputy Donovan,
representing Superintendent of Street*
Fragler, favored the change. They held
that the present site is too small and in
addition some money has already bc< n
spent in refitting the new Quarters.
George T. Marye Jr., owner of the former
yard, agreed to pay whatever expense bad
been incurred. The board by a vote of
S to 4 decided to stand by their former
uctlon, so the yard will be moved.
An effort was made to take the Mayor's
veto of the bid for the furnishing of the
Hall of Justice out of the hands of the
Hullding Committee. Chairman Holland
of the committee explained that a meet
ing had been arranged for to-day, at
which the matter will be considered and
a report presented at the next meeting of
the board. Upon this showing the matter
went over.
The request of a drugstore proprietor on
Powell street to erect an electric sign was
refused. The erection of these signs is
against the law. but the board has the
power to grant them as special privileges.
They gave permission for the placing of
a horseshoe on a Third-street building.
City and County Attorney Lane has
submitted an opioinn to the Supervisors
upon the question of the Grand Jury em
ploying experts. The question developed
over the employment of E. C. Kirkpa trick
nnd A W. Atherton to probe the workings
of the former Board of Education. At
torney Lane holds that the jury can give
employment to but one expert at a time.
Under this ruling, both thus men cannot
be paid, as they were in addition to the
regular expert.
A resolution passed instructing the
clerk of the board to request the San
Frnncisco delegation to the Legislature
to give the matter of the proposed amend
ment permitting the payment of the asso
ciated creditors of the city their attention
and support.
Supervisor Aigeltingor presented a reso
lution calling for the rigid enforcement of
the license required of persons soliciting
property-owners to sign private contract.;.
This is to protect property-owners from
the solicitation of irresponnlble persons.
No permit will be granted unless the pro
visions of the resolutions are complied
with. The duration of time in which
street work shall be done is fixed at not
to exceed six months from the date the
permit is granted by the board.
Judge Cook called attention to the con
dition of the ceiling in his room, which he
said required immediate attention.
The Kearny Street and North End Im
provement Club requested that the board
take immediate steps to have the Hall of
Justice fitted and made ready for occu

' THE KENNEDY MUBD\B.
More Witnesses for the Defense Tes
tify, but Nothing Important
> **â¢ Is Brought Out.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Elizabeth Regan, charged with the mur
der of Policeman Kennedy, was contin
ued before Judge Graham yesterday. Miss
Olive McLaughlin, a sister of the defend
ant, was under cross-examination the
most of the" day, but nothing of impor
tance was elicited.
Policeman John Porter testified to Mrs.
Regan telling him while she had the sa
loon at Fourteenth and Mission streets
that Kennedy had a revolver with which
he was going to shoot her and that she
took it from hlrn. She did not complain
against him as he had just joined the
force and it might "break him."
Mrs. Victoria Wagner was again on the
stand. She testified that Gertrude Sohr
man, Kennedy's tlancee, had told her that
she had been with a young man named
Nolan in November or December at the
theater and that after the theater they
had oysters and champagne. Gertrude
had told her that she was not engaged
to Kennedy and was keeping him and No
lan on "the string." The testimony was
stricken out of the record. Mrs. Wagner
admitted that she was bitterly hostile to
Kennedy and that the feeling had been
reciprocated.
W. H. McCarthy, a street contractor,
testified to having seen Kennedy fre
quently calling upon Mrs. Regan and re
maining for hours with her. The case
will probably be closed to-day, when Mrs.
Regan will take the stand. >
Attorney Barrett for the prosecution
states that he has ascertained that An
drew McDevitt. the young man who tes
tified for the defense Friday, is a mar

dren in the city. McDevitt testified that
he was a single man. He was a lodger

HABBY ELKES IS HEBE.
Looking for the. Scalp of Cycler Jim
my Michael.
Harry Elkes, the American middle-dis
tance champion cycle racer, arrived here
last night. Elkes comes for the expreSs
purpose of getting on a match with .llm
my Michael, the "Welsh rarebit," who la
now here. Michael has met and defeated
every middle-distance rider of note in this
country and Europe, except Elkes. The
latter has only earned his title as cham
pion during the past six months, and now
feels himself eligible to a race, having
"got a reputation."
Elkes' father accompanies him as his
manager. Elkes' greatest victory waa
earned about a month ago, when he de
feated Eddie McDuffle, who once gained
a victory over Michael by over a quarter
of a mile in a fifteen mile paced match.
Michael will have his hands full with
matches during his sojourn on the coast.
"Baby" Gibson of Cincinnati arrived here
last week for the avowed purpose of get
ting on a match with the "Welshman, and
now comes Elkes, with no other object
in view. Both men are young and strong
riders, and with proper pacing should
give the "rarebit" a strong argument at
any distance.
Michael is dividing his training between
the Olympic Club and the park, doing
fymnasium work in the forenoon at the
ormer and* riding his wheel in the park
afternoons. He does as much work every
day as a pugilist in training, and never
seems to tire of it.

VEHICLE TAX
CANNOT BE
COLLECTED
; President Arper has
777 Been Released.
?fiESULT OF A TEST CASE
MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE WINS
/â 7 ''â .. . IN THE HIGHER COURT.
7. 'â â¢ The Ordinance as It Stands Makes It j
â¢ ' Possible to Collect From
7 Vehicles Kept in
Stock.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Feb. 6.
The Merchants' Exchange has won its
Bght against what it considered an un
. Just tax on vehicles. For several years
'. there has been an ordinance imposing a
' tax on every vehicle owned in the city
of Oakland, but It has not been rigidly
enforced. A few months ago the Council
saw that there would probably be a
â¢deficit this fiscal year, and authorized the
enforcement of all ordinances which
would result in assisting tho city treas
ury.
As the ordinance is very comprehensive
. and would have worked an Injury to
many parties, the Merchants' Exchange
â decided to test Its legality In the courts.
. George W. Arper, proprietor of an oil
business, and several others, were arrest
ed for the purpose of making a case. In
the Police Court the matter was passed
by. as it was desirous to get a Superior
Court ruling as soon as possible.
Attorney K. W. Fry argued the matter
for the Exchange and proceeded to show
.that under the ordinance, it would be pos
sible to collect from a carriage factory
â¢* a tax on every vehicle in its store. Many
-other manifestly illegal sections of the
* ordinance were taken up, and finally the
'court ruled in favor of the Exchange,
â¢ The proceedings were had under a writ
Of habeas corpus, and after the argument
Judge Ellsworth ordered the release of
.the defendants.
â¢ Some time ago an ordinance was intro
duced Into the Council reducing by one
half the license fees now paid by saloon
' "keepers. Those who favored the measure
-.stated the' deficit in the treasury could be
. made up by a tax on every merchant and
â¢"â  professional man and . on the vehicles.
'â¢.Before this argument can be made good
"the vehicle ordinance will have to be rad
. Ically â  amended.
TELEPHONE BILLS REJECTED.

; the Company Live Up to Its
Franchise.
â  ALAMEDA, Feb. 6.â The City Trustees
-â¢'did not appoint a successor to the late F.
.'J.'- Fletter to-night, and his place on the
.board will be allowed to remain vacant
.until the spring election. City Attorney
.Taylor gave an opinion during the day to
Chairman Forderer that the appointing
â¢ was not imperative.
â  Telephone bills amounting to $32 15 for
service in January were presented, but
not allowed. Trustee Schulte stated he
had read in The Call that under the tele
phone company's franchise the service to
the city should be free. The bills were
referred to the City Attorney.
William Schumacher was appointed ser
geant of police to succeed John Conrad,
who has been promoted to the offlce of
Chief of Police.
The Alameda concert band was granted
permission to give an open air concert in
the City Park March 28.
Senator George C. Perkins advised the
board that the agitation for an appropria
tion for a public building in Alameda was
hopeless, as Oakland had got ahead of
this city.
Charles Johnson, was appointed a po
lice officer without pay to patrol the
shipyards at Alameda Point.
Attorney George H. Perry filed charges
against Officer Charles Moebus for
swearing falsely to complaints against
five boys .who were arrested for destroy
ing property on the premises of the late
F. K. Krauth Sr. He asked that Moebus
be discharged from the force. The
charges will be investigated next Mon
day evening.
The Trustees settled upon next Monday
night as the time for fixing the water
rates for the ensuing year.
George C. McConnell complained that
the poundman had taken his cow from

mal along Broadway at the end of a rope.
J. Raum of Grand street made a similar
complaint.
The contract for doing the city adver
tising for the ensuing year was awarded
to the Argus Publishing Company, its
bid was $1 per square for the first and 60

Enclnal Publishing Company bid $1 for
the first and 75 cents for subsequent in
sertions.
The Municipal League .closed nomina
tions this evening for places on the ticket
It will present at the spring election.
Charles Hughes declined to be a candi
date j for Library" Trustee. Percy W.
Evans and W. B. Kollmyer were nomin
ated for places on the board. J. D.
Jamieson was named as a candidate for
member of the Board of Education.
There is a mild political sensation
in the fact that the league "turned
down J. B. Lanktree and Dr.
C. L. Tisdale, members of the
School Board, whose terms expire in
April, and who are anxious to succeed
themselves. A surprise was occasioned
by the resignation of Fred Elster, secre
tary of the league. B. C. Brown was
elected to succeed him. The campaign
committee was empowered to fill vacan
cies which might occur on the ticket. All
the candidates will be required to appear
before the league next Monday night and
indorse the platform. The final nominat
ing convention will probably be held the
following week.

M VMKOA, Feb. C â K. Reeves, a
motorman en the Alameda electric line,
has disappeared under such circum
stances as lead his young wife to be
lieve that he has deserted her and their
two-year-old baby.
. Reeves lost his position February _] and
from that time until Wednesday last he
busied himself converting all his avail

tered Into an agreement with an Oakland
motorman to sell him his uniform, and
it was when the man called at Reeves'

suit, that it* first dawned upon the wife
that her h_sband had deserted. her. , â¢
He left home Wednesday morning, tell- j
ing his wife he was going to San Fran-

LEFT HIS FAMILY PENNILESS.
I Alameda Citizens Will Provide for
the Widow.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 6.-One of the sad
dest features of the narrow-gauge rail
road wreck, in which Engineer Jonas and
Fireman Colson lost their lives, is the
fact that the family of the latter is left
i practically in destitute circupmstances.
Colson, not appreciating the uncertainty
lof life, had made no provision for the
maintenance of his family, and when he
met death his wife and little ones were
left wholly without means, besides being
robbed of their protector and provider.
The passengers on the ill-fated train,
appreciating that had the brave engineer
and fireman forsaken their post of duty
I many of them would have been killed or
maimed, have shown their appreciation
by generously contributing to a purse to
relieve the Immediate needs of Mrs. Col
son and her little children. Charles S.
Neal took the. subscription in charge, and
has collected in the neighborhood of $500.
It is calculated to give an entertainment
about March 1.
Inconsistent Citizens.
ALAMEDA, Feb. Câ Residents of West
Alameda are about to take steps to es
tablish a bus line between their section
of the city and Oakland. When Webster
street bridge was closed preparatory to
building the new steel structure the Ala
meda electric line discontinued its Web
ster street service, and West Ala
meda was shut off from any di
rect line of conveyance to the
city across the estuary. When the elec
tric line was running the West End
merchants complained that it was detri
mental to their business because it gave
their erstwhile customers an easy means
of trading in Oakland. Now the residents
are not exactly satisfied with the situa
tion, because they cannot reach Oakland
by public conveyance in less than an
hour.

ALAMEDA, Feb. 6.â The Ladles' Tea
Club met this afternoon at the residence

DREDGING OF LAKE
MERRITT MAY STOP
P. W. RUPPERT SUES FOR AN
INJUNCTION.
He Alleges That the Contract Award
ed to 0. P. Johnson Is Not
Legal.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 6.
An Injunction suit was filed late this aft
ernoon by F. W. Ruppert to void the
contract for the dredging and Improve
ment of Lake Merritt. O. F. Johnson, the
contractor: the City Council, the Board
of Public Works and the City of Oakland
are joined as defendants.
The complaint is an elaborate one. It
recites that the contract let for the dredg
ing and cleaning of Lake Merritt, supply
ing gates, and appropriating $80,000 for
park and boulevard purposes; is illegal,
and sets forth several reasons for said
allegations.
Plaintiff also questions the jurisdiction
of the Board of Public Works. The con
i tract was awarded to O. P. Johnson by
the board on November 4, 1898, and the
complaint sets forth that Johnson's bid
for furnishing dumps was .1009 cent per
yard, while the bid of Quimby & Harrel
son for the same work was but .0909 cent
j per yard, which plaintiff claims would
' make a difference of $16,500.
WRIGHT KEEPS HIS CHILDREN.
Prosecution Unable to Prove That He
Was Unfit to Care for Them.
OAKLAND, Feb. 6.â There was an
other lively and ludicrous scene In
Superior Judge Hall's court this
afternoon, when the complaint of Frank
Schilling for the removal of William
Wright as guardian of his two minor
daughters, Irene and Beatrice Wright,
S was heard and dismissed.
Schilling in his complaint alleged that
Wright was immoral and unfit to act as
guardian; that he was no longer living
i with his wife but consorting with other
j women, and that he was addicted to over
indulgence in liquor.
When the cape was first heard on Mon
day last. Mrs. M. J. Bogen created a
sensation by slapping Wright's faceâ done
in open court. To-day she was again a
witness, and testified that she had had
charge of Wright's two daughters for
over three months; that she knew Wright
only by the name of Richard Lowe; that
he was a drunkard and did not care prop
erly for his children. She admitted, how
ever, when the court questioned her. that
the little ones had always been well fed
and were healthy.
Miss Manlock. who at present has
charge of the children, testified to just
the reverse, and paid a glowing tribute
to the love and affection shown by the
father for his children. Thomas Welsh
and others corroborated her testimony.
After a half hour of argument by Law
yer Schilling, in which he tried to impress
upon the court "dot dere is wheels within
wheels," to which Judge Hall audibly as
sented, the motion to remove Wright as
guardian was denied, the attorney for
Mr. Wright submitting the case without
argument, and Judgment for costs was
given defendant.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, "TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 7 t 1899.
MRS. KENNEDY
HAD A RIVAL
IN THE BARN
Queer Story Told by
a Wife.
HUSBAND MAKES . A .DENIAL
A SCANDAL IN MOUNT EDEN
SOCIETY.
A Mysterious "Woman of Dark
Complexion Who Seems to
Have Existed in tap
Oakland Offloe San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 6.
Mrs. C. R. Kennedy told Judge Ells
worth a remarkable story this morning
during the taking of testimony on a mo
tion to appoint a receiver for the family
property. Mrs. Kennedy wants a divorce
and in her complaint she recites all kinds
of cruelties and sins which she says her
husband has committed. Mr. Kennedy
says he is one of the best of husbands
and that all the trouble Is due to insane
jealousy on the part of his wife.
When Mrs. Kennedy took the stand and
recounted much of the unhappiness and
alleged infidelity that she says wrecked
her wedded life, she alluded to a mysteri
ous dark-complexioned woman who was
stealing her husband's affections.
Kennedy's attorney asked her to tell all
she knew about his strange woman, and
the witness then stated that her husband
kept her in a barn full of baled hay; that
he fed her in there and made frequent
visits to the barn. Mrs. Kennedy, how
ever, said that she had never seen this
mysterious woman in the barn, but she
knew that she lived there and that her
husband frequently boiled eggs -Khich ho
said were for the calves, but which she
believed were part of the lady's bill of
fare.
Encouraged by the court to tell more
of her experiences, Mrs. Kennedy said
that for over seven years her husband had
frequently chloroformed her and while
she was Insensible would bring this
strange woman to the house and enter
tain her. Mrs. Kennedy also stated to the
court that this woman frequently lived
under a fruit tree within sight of the
house, and assured Judge Ellsworth that
she frequently spent hours under this
fruit tree in the daytime.
The Kennedys are well known ranchers
In this county and own considerable prop
erty. Mrs. Kennedy wanted alimony
pending the trial of her suit, and testi
fied that she was absolutely without
means of support. A little cross-examina
tion served to show that the lady owns
much real estate ln her own name, deeded
to her by her husband, and also that with
in the past year he has given her $500
at one time, besides many smaller sums.
Judge Ellsworth denied her request for
alimony and a receiver, but granted her
husband's request for the dissolution of
a temporary Injunction restraining him
from doing as he pleases with his prop
erty. i-'--> "'â .*'-".
In her complaint Mrs. Kennedy men
tions the name of a woman at Mount
Eden, who, she says, is partly responsible
for her domestic troubles. Her husband
asserts that she is a frequent visitor of
spiritualists, but this the lady denies. Mr.
Kennedy intends to defend himself by at
tempting to prove that his wife is of un
sound mind, and that there ls no founda
tion for her charges.

der. The witnesses were the plaintiff; P. !
A. Bergerot, her attorney; F. H. Smith j
attorney for Mrs. Watson No. 1, and
plaintiff's father, J. B. Joyaux of San
â¢ Francisco. ;
j According to the testimony Mrs. Watson
No. 2 learned of her husband's bigamy
< two days after he claimed her as his
j bride. The information was first imparted
Ito her father by two friends of the
bigamous Watson. Detectives were en
| gaged, and it was found that Watson and .
his first wife resided on Post street, San
i Francisco, but the couple had left for
i parts unknown and have never been seen i
! or heard from since. i
The father of the wronged young woman
I testified that he had used every endeavor '
: to bring Watson to justice on a criminal
charge. The marriage license of plaintiff
! and defendant and that of the latter and
Mrs. Watson No. 1 were admitted in evl-
dence, and Judge Ellsworth granted the
decree Immediately, allowing plaintiff also
to resume her maiden name, Marie Hen
rietta Beatrice Joyaux.

TRACING THE
PAST FISCAL
YEAR DEFICITS
â¢* .
Seek Teachers' Salary
" Indebtedness."
THE SCHOOL TANGLE GROWS
PROBABLE MANDAMUS SUITS
FOR AUDITOR WELLS.
â¢ .'Merchant Creditois Threaten to TiÂ«
Up All Moneys if the Teach
ers Do Not Compromise
Wi:h Them.
Sec. 82. Consolidation act â No de
mand upon the Treasurer shall be
allowed by the Auditor in favor cf
any person or officer in any manner
indebted, thereto, without first de
ducting the amount cf such indebt
edness.
â  This Is the authority by Which Auditor
"NVells declines to allow the teachers' Jan
uary warrants. Judge Sea well' a decision
that about $123,000 had been illegally
Jiald during the first part of this fiscal
year !n settlement of a deficit incurred
in the previous year.
the sum of the salary demands of
November and December is about $177,400,
would still be left to the teachers
$54,400. However, President Bergern:
that this sum, or any remaining sum, will
be dlstirbuted pro rata to all creditors
alike, consequently the teachers' small
..hope is further depressed.
'Not only are the unfortunate teachers
.facing the Auditor and his decision, but
â¢' the city's other creditors as welL The
.rtierchants are still in the ring. They
i that they can prove th.it about
$$0,000 in salaries of the year 1597-98 was
. paid out of the fund of 1898-99; that not
â more than 35 per cent of their own bills
; .were contracted illegally, and that the
.remaining 05 per cent of their claims
..should be paid out of this year's fund,
tin this subject Attorney Powers, for the
merchants, makes the fullowing state
ment ol his clients' theories:
. -â¢ The practical effect of the decision is that it
â  f.--r.i:y forces the merchants to go hi and es
tablish the dates of the contracts for which
â they furnished their g-ouds and show that lesa
â  ,t&an one-twelfth had leen contracted for at
. t.i- tm.,- ol th-,: contracts, which in a great
. majority of the cases waa in the early part of
.â  July, and will force them lv establish the
â fact that the contracts of the fifty-three tea. ii
â¢*rs that have been appointed since that time
â¢Â«re void. It will mean the marshaling of sev
eral thousand items and several hundred a -
.founts. The law requires that the claims
. should be paid in the order in which they are
audited and ultimately the merchants will gtt
'their money in full, but instead of being enti
&<?: their money at once they will be
to prove that the board acted according
to. authority of law In ordering the materials
jvtnch were furnished, which will cause a de
lay, of five or six months.
Necessarily, the courts will require the
teachers to put up a bond to make good any
. Judgment which we might obtain hereafter
and- the bondsmen will be compelled to pay.
Tn'.the meantime we will go to the Supreme
Court on behalf of some of the smaller credi
tor* .to attempt to get a reversal of Judge Sea
well's opinion. We hardly expect any nisi
prlu.s judge to take it upon himself to over
. rule the practice of the last thirty years with
reference to the one-twelfth act, but we feel
. .certain as soon as the Supreme Court has the
'.- matter properly presented to It that it will re
verse the decision. We hope to be able to get
to the Supreme Court before the final trial
of. the cane.
â¢ yttx the meantime all the mooted points with
â  reference to the teachers' salaries will of neces
sity be discussed and all the weak points of
. the present system will have to he developed.
â  Thi'; merchants have ncthlMK t.> 'lose and every
: thing to gain by litigation, ami the teachers
have everything to lose and practically notli
-I:.K ;â â  Krtin. and so all we can >1o Is simply
tti i roceed on our even course toward obtuln
lng our money. Hereafter we need not sell
to the Hoard of Kducation, but as the
.teachers have a life's employment before them
â  -any mistake they make will be repeated every
. ye*r for the rest of their natural lives. They
. make no question about the fact that the
schools have used our materials.
â¢ It Is going to be a v>ry difficult matter for
the teachers to get a bond, for whoever should
': X" on the bond would be obligated to pay such
. ef- the hills us were proven to be within the
â¢one-twelfth act, as the great hulk of materials
W.erÂ« furnished under contracts which were lot
. in. Jul>, and. therefore, antedated everything
but the July salaries of the teachers; they arc
bound to be obligated on the bond to the
: amount of several thousand dollars, and as
t-he rlnal judgment cannot be rpached until all
the money In the present fiscal year is used i
up, they will have nothing but the teachers'
Credit as r means to recoup themselves, and ;
IT .'ultimately the Supreme court decide that i
the one-twelfth act does not apply to the
Board they will be compelled to pay
and excuses of litigation.
In other words, if the teachers do not
mpromise with the other
creditors th" merchants will enjoin all
future s;tbiry di-iiKirids until there is d< -
d from such demands sufficient
money t" pay all the merchant claims in
full. As it is well known that for years
teachers have received salaries out of the !
revenue of the subsequent lineal year, this \
is no empty threat.
â¢ Deficit has followed deficit, and if the j
â¢ Auditor begins to figure hack from on"
.â¢fiscal period to another lie will only bo
â d by the statute of limitations. It
â¢ might be possible to find teachers in the
. department who would be forced to work '
out old debts all the remainder of this
.fiscal year.
â¢The consensus of opinion is that the
Auditor should not have brought the
January salary matter into the <iuestion i
as Judge Seawell's order holding back tho ,
November-December money exemptexl
the warrants of last month from any de- i
lav in settlement.
While the moneyless teachers are strug
gling along on "nothing a year and owing
the city $123,000. with no plowing pros
pects of ever getting out of debt except !
by resigning, the Board of Edcation. tree
from the evil work of its predecessor, Is
head and shoulders above water as It
has $608,570, plus about $34,000, to work
with.
Some of the wiser teachers are wonder
ing how It has happened that their in- '
Junction suit has only materially helped 'â 
the board out of the mud at the expense
of their own salaries.
Th* Committee on Judiciary heard argu
ments In the case of Kllpatrlck the ex- i
principal of the Business School, deposed
by the old board. It is intimated that the
appeal to the Supreme Court will be with
drawn on the ground that members of the
board that ousted him were witnesses in '
the case and that Kilpatrick was improp
erly removed.
A number of teachers called unon
Auditor Wells yesterday, and that official
states that he expects several man
damus suits will be commenced against
him. However, he will not recede from
his present position on the January salary
â¢matter until further developments.

State President J. J. Donovan called
the assemblage to order and stated the
nature of the business to come before
the convention.
The Ancient Order of Hibernians is
one of if not quite the oldest benevo
lent organizations in the United States.
It is International in character, for In
every land where Irishmen have taken
up their abode in numbers there are
found branches* of the A. O. 11. In
flourishing condition. In this country
It la the parent of all. Irish societies,
and Its membership equals all the
other Irish societies combined.
(â¢-or years it bas flourished in every
State in the Union, the organization
springing Into existence almost sim
ultaneously with the birth of each
Commonwealth. Its objects are the
loftiest, for besides extending a help
ing hand to the sick and suffering It
Instills sentiments of patriotism in the
hearts of its members, kindling afresh
the love of the emerald motherland
as well as Inspiring veneration for the
adopted country. Therefore no Irish
man belongs to the A. O. H. who ls not
a (rood citizen.
While the various State, county and
division organizations are governed by
the national board, the minor. bodies
have adopted by-laws conflicting in a
measure with those of- the parent
body, and It is to effect a uniformity
of governing rules, as well as to con
tinue the growth of the order and
maintain it on a sound and healthy
basis, that the present convention will
deal with. This is made all the more
cation . in China" last evening, before a
large audience in the Academy of Science
lecture hall. During the past month he
has delivered a number of i lectures on
China's government, laws and . the reli
gion of Its people. â ?<-.> -w

Schooner Mary E. Russ -TTouls the
Bark L. G. Burgess.
The schooner Mary E. Russ, Captain
Wlkender, bound in, last evening drifted
across the bow of the bark L. G. Burgess.
The collision occurred after nightfall

both craft. In some way they became
closely entangled and In the wash of the
tide both vessels were damaged consid
erably.
'. Finally, however, the tug Monarch came
to the rescue and cleared them. :
John Lycett Is Dead.
John Lycett, an old resident of Califor
nia, passed away on Sunday in this
city. When : the Occidental Hotel was
opened he, became a runner for that hos
telry, and later engaged in politics. After
leaving a position in the City_Hall he was
appointed Collector for the ; Harbor Com
missioners, and held the place four years.
He was also in the United States Mint for
a long time. He had the faculty of mak
ing friends wherever he went,- and < his
many friends will hear of his demise with
sincere regret.
John E. Ruggles Is Dead.
â  John E. Ruggles, for many years a
member of the firm, of^ Dodge, Sweeney
& Co., died in this city yesterday: morn-
necessary since the amalgamation of
the two Hibernian societies at the na
tional convention at Trenton last

holding of the national election and
convention in May. Instead of Novem
her. and the state, county and divi
sion elections within forty days there
after. In addition to the state of
ficers a, board of extension, consisting
of five members, was created, for the
purpose of supervising the growth of
the order.
It was decided that hereafter the
State : convention shall levy assess
ments : quarterly to meet the neces
sary running expenses.
The most important action was the
amendment providing that no picnics
or celebrations shall be held on Sun
days or; Decoration day. Several
Grand Army delegates spoke in favor
of- including Decoration Day in the
amendment, and It was unanimously
adopted. After adopting the following
resolutions of respect to the memory
of the late Judge Ryan of Dos Angeles
the convention adjourned until to-day:
Whereas, In the providence of God and ln
accordance with divine wisdom, our es
teemed brother, William A. Ryan of Los

A New Water Supply. !
J. H. Bartlett of 502 "Washington street
has a , new * plan ; for supplying the city i
with pure water at a nominal cost, which
he Will lay before the Board of Supervis
ors ' with the request that that body call
the matter to the attention of the Legis
lature at once. His plan is to bring
down water from Lake Tahoe by means
of pipe lines, sluices or viaducts. As the
lake is 6000 feet above the sea level, the
mo us fall would *. make the water
available as power for manufactories, as
wen as giving an excellent pressure with
out engines in case of a big fire. .

Two burglars early yesterday morning
broke into the residence of Sam Bernard
at 526 Oak street and proceeded to help
themselves to a quantity of silverware
which they placed, in a sack. As they
were leaving the house they were discov
ered by 'Mr. Bernard, who fired three
shots at them. " Leaving their booty be
hind, -the house breakers jumped through
a window which they. had forced open
and ran up Oak street. The report of the
pistol shots attracted the attention of two
police officers who lost no time in reach
ing the scene. After learning that the
house had J been entered the policemen
went in search of the burglars, but failed
to find them. yy-:
An examination of the premises dis
closed, that the desperate house breakers
had gained an entrance by prying open a
window ' with a "jimmy" which they
dropped in their flight. After entering the
house they .went to the dining room and
broke open a closet containing a miscel
laneous assortment of silverware. Plac
ing the silverware in a sack which one of
them carried they started to leave the
house, when discovered and fired on.
A citizen who .was passing at the time
last night informed the police that he be
lieved that one of the burglars had been
wounded. Â» Hearing the shots he ran over
to the house, thinking that a murder waÂ»
being committed. As he reached the scene
of the shooting he saw two men climb
through an open window and start to run.
One of them, he says, acted as though
he was wounded. He was helped along
by his confederate who, amid curses,
threatened to shoot him unless he got a
"move on." ***â¢
Last night the detectives were scouring
the city in search of the supposed wound
ed burglar. They are convinced that he
and his partner have been operating in

PANHANDLE AND PAVEMENT.
Real Estate Owners' Association Dis
cusses Proposed City Im
provements.
The Real Estate Owners' Association
met last evening in the Crocker Building
to discuss practical city improvements 0
Supervisors Holland and Aigeltinger were
present and their remarks and sugges
tions were listened to with marked atten
tion.
One of the questions before the associa
tion was the method of laying bltumi-
S?"i roa^ wa -y on Market street west of
blxth. The Supervisors present stated
that if there is any difference between
the specifications of the pavement laid
west of Sixth street and that east of
that thoroughfare it was a matter per
taining to the last Board of Supervisors.
Nothing can now be done except carry
out the terms of the contract.
The Panhandle proposition .was unani
mously favored. An extension from Gold
en Gate Park to the Presidio as well as
to Market street "fras considered, as wMI
as the approximate costs of such im
provements. The matter of a temporary
pesthouse was discussed; also the enforce
ment of the wide tire law; the ordinance
against the overloading of trucks that ply
on the new pavements and the use of
square basalt blocks on the streets of the
water front.
Supervisor Holland advised that all
practical schemes of improvement coming
before the association be mentioned in a
report to the board and such suggestion
would be incorporated in the call for im
provement bonds.
The new officers of the association are
as follows: President. I. Harris; First
Vice President, W. J. Bryan: Second Vice
President, Dr. C. S. Mann; Secretary, W.
W. Campbell; Executive Committeeâ
K. Prior, J. A. Bergerot, F. L. Hurst, F.
A. Hornblower, A. F. Lageal, B. H. Lich

B'NE B'RITH TO ENTERTAIN.
District Grand .uodge No. 4 Will Re-
ceive the Constitution Grand
Lodge.
The next session of the District Grand
Lodge No. 4 of the Independent Order of
B'ne B'rith will be held in this city, com
mencing Sunday, the 19th inst., in B. B.
Hall. There will be present about one
hundred and forty delegates from the sev
eral lodges in this State,' Nevada, Oregon,
.Washington,- ' Montana' and Utah which
are in District No. 4. . -
In addition to the regular business that
will come up during the sessions, the
Grand Lodge will take steps to* arrange
for the reception of the delegates to the
Constitution Grand Lodge, which is the
highest body of the order, and which is
to meet in this city- in 1900. At the ses
sion held in Cincinnati, 0., in 1895, for
that body -meets -but once in five years,
there was a great struggle to have San
Francisco selected as the meeting place,
but upon "the assurance that the people
would show, them what a San Francisco
welcome is, the majority of the represen
tatives were won over. There will be at
that session representatives from all
parts of the United States, Germany, Aus
tria, Roumania, and Jerusalem.
To the end that the welcome shall be
as complete as promised the several
lodges are contributing to a general fund
for that purpose, and the affairs in con
nection with the reception and entertain
ment is under the supervision of Joseph
Rothschild," l. J. Aschheim, Sol. Zekind,
Albert Elkus, H. P. Bush, D. S. Hirsh
berg, Herman Gutstadt, Henry Schwartz
and Louis Metzger.
During the session of the District Grand
Lodge there will* be a theater party at the
Tivoli for the purpose of increasing the
entertainment fund. The sub-committee*
on Tivoli night, the 20th, is composed of
M. Kollman, Herman Enkel, Jesse E.
Marks and Lucius L. Solomons. These
gentlemen are also members of the gen
eral committee.

rendezvous in the "wine room" after q
the show. <&
The plans of great men oft go o

Miss Duval went to meet the czar ~

; Greenway, however, has an eye for -x
form and he was not to be fooled -A
on a girlâ even when she had ever X
so many unnecessary garments on. -A
The result was that Duval was dis- <*;
missed and Hayes got a perfumed <->
note, telling her to ''go to the cos- X
turner and be measured," and that <$>
a "carriage would call" for her "on 5
the evening of the, 14th." 6

SHIPWRIGHTS
WILL BUILD
MARINE' WAYS
Are Carrying the War
Into Africa.
HAY & WRIGHT TROUBLE AGAIN
THE ASSOCIATION IS IN THE
FIGHT TO STAY.
Opposition Ways to Cost $50,000 Are
to Be Built at South San
Francisco or North
Beach. ""* y
The . Shipwrights' Association and th_
shipbuilding firm of Hay & Wright have
been at outs for a long time, and matters
have now come to a climax. A week ago
the shipwrights' issued a circular setting
forth all the points at issue and asking
the shipowners to stand by them and help
them to secure their rights. The marine
waj-s at Alameda, owned by Hay &
Wright have proved a great convenience
to shipowners, -however, and they turned
the scale against. the shipwrights. Now
the "association la going to build marine
ways -at either South San Francisco or
North Beach, and in this way the ship
wrights hope to turn the tables on Hay &
Wright.
"The Shipwrights' Association la one of
the wealthiest organizations in San Fran
cisco," said President Thomas McCdnnell
yesterday. "Individually our members
are all fairly well off, and 100 of them are
putting up $500 each to build one of the
finest and best equipped marine ways in
the United States. We have not yet de
cided upon the site, but will build them
wherever we can get the cleanest and
clearest water. The ways will be built
at either South San Francisco or North
Beach, and work will begin on them at
once.
"The ways will be run by the associa
tion, and are to be at the disposal of all
the bosses. They will be tun at a small
advance on cost. Naturally the stock
holders will want a small return on their
investment, but I can assure you the
charges will be so low that the bosses
won't grumble.
"The Shipwrights' Association is not
going into business on its own account.
We will own the ways, of course, but
we will work for the bosses just the same
as we always have. There will be no
change whatever, except that we hope to
see the bulk of the work that goes to
Alameda done on this side. All the ship
wrights want is a fair day's wage for a
fair day's work. Our association has a
good treasury, but that is going to remain
intact. None of the funds will be used
in this venture. At our last meeting 100
members subscribed $500 each, and that
will give us enough and to spare with
which to build and equip the ways. I
think $50,000 will afford far superior ac
commodation to that offered the shipown
ers by Hay & Wright. Once the ways
are completed we will carry the war into
Africa, and I think Hay & Wright will
come out second best in the conflict."
ARE MUSTERED OUT.
The Eighth California Boys Left the
Service Yesterday.
The last of the Eighth California Regi
ment retired from service yesterday,
when companies A and X, which haa
been stationed at Benicia Barracks, went
through the ceremony of mustering out.
General Shatter returned from Bakers
field last night. All is a flurry of excite
ment in army circles, as it seems proba
ble that more troops will be sent here
for some time, and the officers who
are in charge of garrison duty are hur
ried to do the work necessary.
A Youthful Diamond Thief.
Harry Helman, a boy of 13 years, wis
convicted in Judge Cook's court yesterday
of petty larceny. He stole a small dia
mond from a Market-street' jewelry store,
and was detected while making his escape.
He alleged that he found the stone on the
street, but the Jury failed to accept his
story and found him guilty. The youthful
prisoner will be sentenced Saturday.
The Female Robber.
Nellie Smith, the young girl charged
with robbery by Adoiph Fribrich early
Sunday morning on Grant avenue, was ar
raigned before Acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday and her case was continued till
Friday. She denies taking the *$6 from
Fribrich and says he gave her $2 and
the balance was her own money.
Roasts the Batemans.
At the meeting of the International
Union of Bricklayers last night tha
trouble between that organization and
Bateman Bros., contractors for the Hall
of Justice, was again the subject of dis
cussion. A set of resolutions condemn
ing the contractors for allowing carpen
ters to set terra cotta were adopted and
will be presented at the next meeting of
the Board of Supervisors.
