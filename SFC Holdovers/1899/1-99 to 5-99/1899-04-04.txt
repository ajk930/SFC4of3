MOORE TO
BE KILLED
ON SIGHT
MURDERER MOORE'S CABIN.
NEVADA CITY, April 3.â Bad man
Moore, the murderer of Police
man William H. Kilroy, is still
at large, a fugitive from jus
tice with a price of $1000 upon
his head. Scores of armed men anx
ious to earn the coveted reward and
vent their anger upon tho outlaw are
searching the neighboring mountains.
Their efforts yesterday availed them
absolutely nothing. No trace of the
lone bandit was found. Not even an
idle rumor of Moore having been seen
reached their ears, but the searchers
did not despair. Worn out men who
have been in the mountains searching
for thf* desperado since Saturday came
in from the trails this evening for pro
visions, and incidentally to get a
night's rest.
Sheriff Getchell. T'nder Sheriff Pns
coe and a posse left here at daybreak
and drove to Crystal Springs, about
nine miles distant, on the Washington
road. A careful search of mining tun
nels, drifts, inclines and compartment
shafts at that place set at rest the
many rumors that Moore was hiding in
that vicinity. The posse left Its team
at Crystal Sprines and beat back afoot
through the canyons and underbrush.
finding no trace of the fugitive It ar
rived here to-night f otsore and weary.
While the desperado staik.s abroad in
the mountains ttaece is fear In the
hearts of the lone prospectors of the
outlying districts. Occupants of min
ing cabins in the foothills n<'\v barri
cade their doors when they lay down to
sleep at night, and a loaded si.<>tgun
stands within reach. M or â  provisions
are believed to be almost exhausted,
and it is certain he will make an at
tempt to replenish them at one of the
many cabins in the neighboring moun
tains. If resistance is offered others
may fall victims to his unerring aim.
Every teamster who rinds it necessary
to traverse the lonely mountain roads
carries a shotgun, and every prospector
who saunters into town from the foot
hills is armed with a weapon of some
sort in anticipation of a meeting with
the desperado. Moore is the one man
in the county whom everybody fears
He is as quick as a Hash with rifle.

In his dash for liberty Moore is ac

There are many people here who be
lieve Moore is hiding in some spot close
to his cabin on Lltt Creek, near
the Charannet mine and scarcely any
body in the whole county believes the
fugitive has succeeded In getting any
distance out of the mountains. All the
roads and trails have been carefully
guarded since Saturday and there has
been little chance for him to escape.
The f^ct that the fugitive carried his
water bucket with him in his hurried
flight lends color to the general theory
that he has taken possession of some
rocky cavern or dry mining shaft close
to his cabin. Moore has often boasted
that he could hide himself within a
mile of the town where it would be
lmp< Mible for anybody to find him.
The killing of Kilroy undoubtedly
was premeditated and it is fair to pre
sume that Moore expected to be placed
in a position where he would be com
pelled to elude a horde of angry and
brave men anxious to bring him to ac
count for his misdeeds. This theory Is
borne out by the condition in which the
officers found Moore's cabin when they
arrived there shortly after the murder
was committed. Moore had been there
and removed everything that would be
useful to him in his flight. It was evi
dent the murderer had placed every
thing in readiness for a hurried depart
ure. On the floor was found a receipted
bill for $20 worth of groceries which
were supplied only three days before
by a local grocer. None of the pro
visions was found In the cabin.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1899.
Captain Nihell of Company C.Nation
al Guard, accompanied by City Mar
shal Tomkin, Journeyed* over the ridge
to Spencervllle to-day. There they in
terviewed Uanclvr Taunt, who said
â day he bad Been and talked with
Moore. The officers hpard Taunt's
story, hut placed little credence in it.
They beat t.ar-k through the canyon,
car* fully searching the woods and un
ili'ii'iiish.
Early to-morrow morning another
large detachment of members of Com
pany C of thU city will go out on the
trails behind Banner Mountain and
beat through the country in a sys
tematic manner, very much on the
same plan as thpy drive rabbits in
Fresno. The militiamen are anxious to
pet Moore in their clutches, and be
hind their fervid anxiety there is an in
t< resting little story:
Moore at one time was a member of
Company C, and was famed the count v
over for being the best rifle shot in the
company. It was easy* for him to carry
off all the prizes, and he speejdlly
gained the reputation of being the best
rifle shot in the country. His aim was
so accurate that a suspicion that he
had tarn] d with his rifle crept Into
the mmt 1 ..- C his rivals, and they set
a trap for him.
Several of the boys watched Moore
fully, and after a prize shooting
contest one of them picked up the mur
derer's rifle and subjected it to a close
Bcrutiny." He found that the suspicions
of his comrades were not groundless.
Moore, with his characteristic shrewd
ness and knowledge of tools, had filed
the trigger of the rifle down to such a
point that it went oft" at the slightest
touch of the finger. This was a great
aid at the prize Bhoots, as the rest of
the contestants were compelled to exert
a power of seven and a half pounds on
the triggers of their weapons to ex
plode, the cartridge.
For this tri<k Moore was immediately
discharged from the company and
klisted by nearly everybody in
town. The Incident is still fresh in the
iries of the boys of Company C.
and they will not be disposed to show
the murderer anything but scant cour
tesy sh'iuld he fall Into their bands.
The only reliable information as to the
route taken by Moore Jifter he left his
cabin is given by Frank Sarrdow. a
prospector, who lives in a cabin at the
top "l" J 'helps Hill. Moore's tracks were
traced In the soft mud by ".lack" Kil
roy. a brother of the murdered police
man, along the North Ranner mine
road ms far as the abandoned black
smith Bhop of the mine. There the trail
ended, and the murdered man's brother
and his companion wasted several
shots rit thi- old Bhop. in the hope that
Moore had taken refuge therein. They
were disappointed, as the fugitive had
cut across the road at that point and
Journeyed over the hills toward San
dow's cabin.
The lone occupant was awakened In
the dead of night by passing footfalls
and the barking of his deerhounds. He
si ruck a light and looked out of the
window in time to see Moore passing
the house on a trail a few yards dis
tant. Bandow is certain that it was
Moore, for he has known him for the
last twenty years.
From that point theman-hunters have
lost all trace of the murderer, but they
hope to capture or kill him within the
next twenty-four hours. The lonerer
Moore remains at large the greater
menace he is to the lives of innocent
people who may be so unfortunate as
to cross his path. He certainly knows
by this time that scores of brave men
are on his trail, and. if captured. Judge
Lynch will be his judge and jury, so
the citizens here fear that Moore will
not hesitate to carry out the theory of
outlawsâ "dead men tell no tales." The
posses who are hunting the murderer
have been instructed to kill him on
sight.
Since the murder of Policeman Kil
roy a belief exists her" that Moore is
responsible for at least two other mur
ders that have taken place during the
S last five years. It is now suspected
j that Moore murdered Driver Meyers of
j the BloomfleM stn^e and Superintend
ent Gaviota of the Perbeo mine. Roth
murders were cowardly affairs, the men
being shot down without being given a
| fnrhting chance for their lives. The
crimes have always remained unsolved
mysteries. In both cases the murderer
attempted to rob hisvictims of treasure
which th'-y were bringing from the
mines, and each time he was unsuc
cessful, because the horses ran at the
sound of his rifle.

MANILA, April 3, 7:55 p. m.â A
reconnoissance made by cavalry
under Major Rucker this after- â 
noon developed into a sharp skirmish '
with 1000 insurgents intrenched at <
Quingua, aye miles to the northeest ,
of Malolos, the main body of the rebel i
\ army being apparently between Quin
i gna and Pulilan. Other detached
I forces of the enemy retreated to the
eastward and entered Mateo Valley,
; where they were repulsed by General
Hall's troops.
Scouts penetrating close to Calumpit
found a small group of mules sinking
in the soft spot in the road. This led
to the discovery of two breech-loading
coast defense guns, buried at the cross
roads. The presence of the guns there ,
is a mystery. The troops will make a .
thorough search for any additional i
arms that may be hidden.
Major Cobbe of the Third Artillery
has been appointed provost marshal.
The twenty miles of country between
Caloocan and Malolos is dotted with
white flags displayed by hundreds of
Filipinos, who are returning to their I
homes. The better class of Filipinos,
who fled at the approach of the Ameri
can troops, are now coming back over
land or in boats to Malolos. A native ;
priest entered the American lines to
day, asking permission to return to his
clerical duties.
Prisoners captured by the American

THE TOPEKA
IS LOST ON
SOUTH LEDGE
STEAMSHIP CITY OF TOPEKA.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 3.â According to news received by the
steamer Danube, which arrived this evening, -the Pacific Coast
Company has lost another vessel in Alaskan waters. The latest
craft to become a victim of the reefs which abound in the in
tricate northern waters is the steamer City of Topeka, Captain
Thomson, which ran on the rocks rf the south ledge in Wrangel Nar
rows soon after midnight on Wednesday last while hound from Seattle
to Bkaguay with a big crowd of goldseekers and a heavy cargo of freight
aboard. She had just left Wrangel and was about a third of the way
through the Intricate channel, which is seldom attempted at night, when
she struck heavily on a reef. The blow cut a big hole in her port aide
and water rushed into her hold. Had she not been hung up so tightly
on the rocks she undoubtedly would have foundered, and according to
her officers many would have found a watery grave.
There was no excitement A hasty investigation showed that the
steamer was as firmly held as though monred at her wharf and the
passengers went back to the beds which they had left so hurriedly
when the steamer crashed on the reef.
On Thursday afternoon the United States lighthouse tender Manza
nita came, into the narrows and in answer to the signals of distress
displayed by the wrecked liner she sent boats to her and took off the
shipwrecked passengers. They were taken to Skaguay by the Manza
nita.
The Topeka, when the Danube passed her. was full of water, which
has totally destroyed her cargo. Her bow was hanging fast on a jagged
reef and a large hole was noticeable in her' port bow. Sh^ will have to
remain in her present position until divers can be sent up from the
Sound to patch up the rents made by the reefs. An effort was made to
get divers at JuneÃu, but none were obtainable there.
Commodore Irving, of the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company,
who was a passenger on the Danube, says the wreck of the Topeka was
due to the fact that buoys and aids to navigation iirf missing in north
ern waters on account of the recent storms. He says n^w surveys and
th p establishment of several lighthouses are urgently needed in Alas
kan waters. At present there is but one light in Alaska, that at Sitka.
The accident to the Topeka will ha ;e the effect of again increasing
the insurance on Alaskan vessels, whirh is at present skyhigh. A num
ber of companies have signified th^ir intention to refuse risks on all
steamers plying in Alaskan waters in consequence of the casualty.
The City of Topeka was built by J. Roach & Son at Chester, Pa.,
in IKS 4 for the Oregon Improvement Company. She is of 1057 tons bur
den. IRS feet long. 35 feet 2 inches broad and 18 feet deep. She has been
in the Alaska trade ever since sh<= was built. In connection with the
Queen she carried all the tourist travel of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company and was to have gone north with an excursion this summer.
Her loss at this time will fall very heavy on the fhmpany. as two of its
steamersâ the City of Put': 'a and Senatorâ are in use by the Government
as transports.
AVENGES THE
WRECKING OF
A HAPPY HOME
SALINAS, April 3.â A feud of two
years' standing came to a rath
er abrupt termination this after
noon, when F. Kopman. a
wealthy rancher of Blanco, shot
and dangerously wounded an old
time employe, Harry Aguirra. in
a saloon at Riverside, a small place
near this city. That these two men
were enemies has been known for some
time by the acquaintances of both, and
it has often been asserted that when
they mci blood would flow. Kopman is
an old veteran of the Civil War and
Aguirra a man with an unsavory repu
tation and dangerous when angered.
Both men are sure, shots, and had it
not been that Aguirra was unarmed it
is likely neither man would have es
caped alive.
The shooting affray of to-day brings
to light a sensational case -that of a
hired man winning the affections of
his employer's wife after having been
befriended eighteen years by his bene
factor. It also brings to light the
separation of a man and wife wealthy,
highly respected and influential, and
the ultimate breaking up of a charming
home. For a long time has it been ru
mored that the relations of Mrs. F.
Kopman and Harry Aguirra were im
proper, but not until about two years
ago were there developments of a sen
sational nature. At that time facts
were made public which were after
ward hushed. Kopman is said to have
signed a note for $250, and the charge
that he threatened the life of Harry
Aguirra was not prosecuted. This came
to light when Attorney W. A. Kearney
sued Kopman for the recovery of the
note. Kopman brought a counter suit
for blackmail against Kearney, to
whom the note was made payable, and
testimony was introduce.! in an at
tempt to prove that Kopman had en
tered into an agreement with Ed Rice,
a man of unsavory reputation, to dis
pose of Aguirra. It was asserted that
Kopman offered to pay $I<KIO if his
enemy were killed: that the man who
was to have done the job asked $5000.

couraged and scattered. Insurgents are
returning to their homes in the cities and
villages between here and points north
of Malolos. which our roronnoitonnc:
parties have reached, and desire the pro
tection of the Americans. News from
the Vlaayan Islands is more encouraging
every day. OTIS.
War Department officials were
pleased by this cheering dispatch. It
contained a great deal of encouraging
news and those who know General Otis
well say he is not a man to take a
roseate view of the situation Unless
there is reason for it. It is argued at
but Kopman would not agree and th^
fell through. Rice or one of his
associates confessed, whereupon Ag
ulrra had Kopman arrested for having
threatened his life. Attorney Kearney
went to the ranch of the accused and
made terms whereby the case w: s
dropped upon' the $250 consideration.
Aguirra, however, claimed he never re
ceived any of the money.
Aguirra had long since left the j
home of his old-time employer in Blan- !
co and had gone to live with his own
family in Castroville, but there still
seemed to linger in the hearts of both
men hatred for one another. About
eight mouths ago Kopman, it is claim
ed, left the Blanco home and has not
resided with his wife since. A short
time ago he purchased an interest in
the Riverside saloon, a resort several
miles from this city, near the Spreckela
sugar factory. It is supposed Agtlirra
did not know this, for yesterday he
drove up to the place with his wife and, j
entering, ordered beer. TTe claims he
saw no one except the bartender on
entering the place and did not know !
Kopman was there, else he would have
been prepared.
As the drinks were about to be i
served, the wounded man asserts. Kop- j
man arose from behind the bar and lev- j
eled a pistol at his head. He knew
Kopman would shoot and consequently
tried to dodge. The man did shoot, the
ball entering Aguirra's neck on the left j
side, coining out at the back of the
head, and missing the jugular vein '
about an eighth of an inch. The wound- ;
ed man started to run for his buggy.
Two more shots were fired at him, but 'â¢â 
he escaped, and, gaining his convey
ance, was driven ns fast as possible by
his wife to this city to obtain medical
assistance.
The Sheriff was notified and went to
Riverside and arrested Kopman. He
was brought to this city and placed
under heavy Monds. These he gave and
is now at liberty. It is not yet known
whether Aguirra will die from the ef
fects of the wound.

REPUBLICAN
VICTORIES IN
OHIO STATE
But the Heads of Several
Local Tickets Are Won
by Democrats.
McKISSON IS BEATEN
Headed Bolting Republicans and
Bourbons in the Legislature
Against Senator Hanna.
Specla: to The Call.
CINCINNATI, April 3.â The elections
In Ohio to-day were : general for mu
nicipal and township officers. While
local issues usually control' these soring
elections, yet there were other influ
ences In some places to-day. At Cleve
land there was a decisive Democratic
victory on the head of the ticket only,
but it was not one due alone to the
local opposition to May McKisson for
a third term. McKisson last year was
the candidate of the bolting Republi
cans and the Democrats In the Legis
lature against Senator Hanna.
At Columbus a publican Mayor
was elected for the first time in twelve
years. At Cincinnati the Republicans
have a plurality of 7000, though the
present Democratic Mayor was elected
â¢ two years ago by almost as large a
plurality.. At Toledo an independent Re
publican was elected on Pingree issues,
assisted by factional complications. At
Dayton the Democrats made municipal
gains, but the Republicans gained in
the townships, which seemed to be the
case. throughout the State.
While the greatest change was at
Cleveland, where the Republicans have
controlled the city for years with Rob
ert McKisson as Mayor, yet what is
known as the Western Reserve main
tains its usual Republican majorities,
with some gains over those of former
April elections, notably at Youngstown,
. Warren, Cadiz, Delaware and other cit
ies in Northeastern Ohio. In the small
er cities, as well as in the rural dis
tricts, the Republicans claim gains, no
tably at Chillicothe, where there was a
change, Mayor Brown being defeated
â¢ for re-election by James Wood by 300.
At Defiance the Democrats lost two [
Councilmen and a member of the Board
of Education. At Hamilton the Demo
. crats maintained their majority, also at ;
Lima, Newark, Circleville, Upper San
dusky, Wapakoneta, Millersburg and
Van Wert. At Zanesville and Marys
ville. the Republicans were successful.
â  and they made gains at Napoleon. As
a rule the vote was light At Canton,
..the home of McKinley, James Robert
son, Republican, was â  â  -ted Mayor by
thirteen plurality, a change from the
present Democratic administration.
Weather conditions were favorable
for a full vote at the city municipal
election, yet only 44,500 votes were cast.
The. - were only three officials to be
elected â Judge of the Superior Court
and two members of the Board of City
Aftairs. . he official result is as follows:
â Rufus B. Smith CR.)i Judge of the
Superior Court, 30,432. Judge Smith
had no opposition on the Democratic
â  ticket.
The official vote of members of the
Board of City Allans was: William
> McAllister (K.), .41; Albert Fischer
(R.), 2ti,275; H. J. Enneking (D.), 18,778;
J. C. Sherlock (D.), Â£73; average Re
publican majority, 6976.
A vote taken on authorizing the city
to purchase the zoological gardens for
a park resulted: For purchase, 20,180;
against, 11,326.
The two other tickets in the field poll
ed almost nothing.
' COLUMBUS. Ohio, April 3.â Samuel
L. Black . D.), Mayor of Columbus, was
defeated lor re-eiection by Samuel J.
Swartz (R.), formerly Police Judge, by
a decisive majority. Mayor Black is
president of the League of American
Muncipalitles, and this fact was used
as an argument in support of his can
didacy by the party managers. The
election was fought on strictly party
lines, however, and was one of the most
bitterly contested in the history of the
city, the total vote cast, 27,264, being
heavier than at the gubernatorial elec
tion of last fall. Judge Swartz is the
lirst (Republican elected Mayor of the
city in twelve years. The city is nor
mally Republican by about 1000, though
it has given majorities of upward of
3000. Heretofore local issues and fac
tional lights have operated against the
Republicans, but united action was se
cured tv-day by an agreement which
â¢ gave Judge Nash, who is candidate for
the Republican nomination for Govern
.or, the solid delegation from Franklin
' County in the coming State convention.
The vote is as follows. Swartz (R.),
14,151; Black (D.), 12,758; Swartz' plu
rality, 13y3.
There were three minor party can
didates, but they polled an insignificant
vote. All other candidates on the lie
publican ticket were elected.
TOLEDO, Ohio, April 3.â To-day was
a perfect election day, clear and cool,
and the large registration was fully
brought out. It is probable that 26,000
. votes were cast for the head of the
ticket, but the Jones men, after voting
for their favorite candidate, seemed to
care little for the minor offices, and the
consequence is that the other candi
dates will fall short. Mayor S. M.
Jones, who was a candidate on an in
dependent ticket, with a platform for
municipal ownership of public utilities,
has been elected by at least 5000 plu
rality and probably a majority over all.
The contest was marked by great
spirit, but no arrests were made and no
disturbances were reported. The vote
being heavy the count is slow, but the
returns seem to show that the regular
Republican ticket, except for Mayor,
has been elected by a close vote.
â¢ At 10 o'clock the Jones management
had heard unofficially from nearly
every precinct in the city and they give
Jones a plurality of 5000.
They state that their candidate will
have a majority over all others and
they concede that the Republican nom
inees, except for Mayor, are elected.
John Farley Elected.
CLEVELAND. Ohio. April 8.-John H.
Farley (D.) was elected Mayor over Rob
ert E. McKission (R.), incumbent,
.to-day by a plurality of about 3600..
The first returns indicated a much
.greater victory for Farley, but his plural
ity was cut down by later returns. The
remainder of the Republican ticket, in
cluding City Treasurer, Police Judge, Po
lice Prosecutor, Justice and four mem
bers of the School Council elected at
large, will have substantial pluralities.
Tin Republicans will control the City
Council.
McKisson's defeat was due to the de
fection of Republicans who voted against
him because of his bolt from Senator
Hanna and his party during the contest
before the Legislature a year ago last
winter. The whole ticket suffered some
INFECTED CLOTHES
STOLEN AT CHICAGO
Two Suits TaKen by a Thief
May Cause a Smallpox
Epidemic.
CHICAGO, April 3.â One Chicago thief has stolen more than he bar
gained for. He is in possession of two suits of clothes infected with viru
lent smallpox. The suits were taken from a clothes line at 777 North
Clark street Saturday evening. They belong to C. W. Gassert, one of
the disinfectors of the health department. Gassert spent Saturday in
working among- the colored population of Chicago's smallpox infected
district. When he went home he hung the suit he had been wearing
and another one which he was to fumigate, on the clothes line in the
rear of the house. Sunday morning he went to get the garments to sub
ject them to disinfection, but they were gone. The health department
is much perturbed, as it fears the clothes, which were new and of good
quality, may be pawned and purchased and the disease widely spread
by the new owner, thereby causing an epidemic.

Kisson, but net enough to defeat any of
the Other candidates. The election was
orderly in most respects. The vote was
very heavy and the count was somewhat
delayed, but practically all the returns

Republicans Win at Marquette.
MARQUETTE, Mich.. April 3.â The Re
publican State and judicial tickets won in
this county by about 500 majority. Neid
hart, citizen candidate for Mayor, was
elected here. Andrews, labor candidate,
was ekctcd in Ishpeming by 500 majority.

FINDLAY, Ohio. April 3.â The Republi
cans elect their entire city ticket by about

very discouraging effect upon the na
tives who have been following Aguin
aldo.
It is evident by the references which
Genera] Otis makes to reeonnoitering
parties that he is having the country
thoroughly covered and that the in
formation which they are giving him
is the ba?i? of the dispatch received to
day. It is believed that desertions will
soon deplete the army of Aguinaldo to
little or nothing.
That portion of the dispatch relating
to the Visayans refers to the opera
tions of which Iloilo is the base. The
group includes Panay, Bohol, Cebu, Ne
and other islands of less import
ance. The rebellion against the United
States authorities was not very serious
in these- islands, being stirred up by
emissaries of Aguinaldo at Iloilo. The
ant defeat of Aguinaldo's forces
north of Manila has no doubt had a de-
Ing effect on other insurrection
ists.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1899.
DUTY OK LUMBER
SHOULD REMAIN
Great Industry Needs
Protection.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 3.â United States
Senator Addison C. Foster, after spend
ing several weeks investigating in the
East and Middle West sentiment as to
the attitude of the joint high commis
sion on the lumber and coai tariffs and'i
the Alaska boundary question, has re
turned to his home in this city. He
says:
"I am of the opinion that theo-emoval
I of the duty on lumber is one, of the
most important concessions sought by
i England. In fact, while the desired
( pert of entry to the northern gold fields
j is much in demand among Canadians
and Englishmen, I rather incline to the
opinion that a satisfactory adjustment
|of the lumber and coal schedules is
; equally, if not more so, in demand. On
my way west I consulted with various
'. Senators and Congressmen on this sub
ject and I rind, all things considered,
â  that our lumber people in all parts of
the United States are inclined to yield
! a little in this matter provided the tar
iff on lumber, and coal, also, if possible,
could be made part of the treaty. Lum
bering is a great industry and we could
not for a moment consider the proposi
tion to remove the tariff altogether.
"The lumbermen, as a rule, would
willingly make a reduction on the tariff
from $2 to $1 60 a thousand provided
â¢ that rate were made a part of the
treaty and thereby became permanent
as long as the tr< aty lasts. This would
| constitute a reduction of 20 per cent in
the lumber tariff as now in force."
Senator Foster is opposed to making
' reductions in the tariff on lumber on
Bp< cial grades. This, in his oponion,
would not prove satisfactory and would
; be certain to result in abuses of the
privileges granted. He strongly favors
' the joint high commission, or, at least,
! the American membi rs thereof, visiting
; the Pacific Northwest and making a
trip of inspection to Alaska. He has
already Invited a number of friends t>>
I the coast and believes much more rea
sonable anil Just terms could be ag
! upon if the members of the commission
were thoroughly posted by a personal
' inspection regarding the conditions ex
isting here and in Alaska.
Senator Foster urges the policy of
expansion as being a part of the com
mercial necessities of the age. He
holds that the United States must ex
pand commercially to hold its place
' with the great powers of the world and
that the Orient is the only great field
: for expansion of this kind.
CHARLES Ay GLIDDEN
DIES AT MARYSVILLE
MARYSVILLE, April 3.â Charles A. j
Glidden, a fiutter County capitalist, :
' breathed his last at his home near li ir
keys Corners last night. News of his j
death came as a surprise to his friends,
; who only yesterday were told that his
\ condition had become greatly improved
i under the treatment by Ran Francisco
specialists. He had been ailing with i
stomach, liver and heart troubles for a j
; long time. He arrived home from a two
months' stay in San Francisco last Satur- \
1 day at noon, accompanied by his daugh
ter, Mrs. Charles Stone.
Xesterday Mr. Glidden appeared in ex
cellent spirits and apparently relished his
evening meal. After supper he went to j
the parlor, where he remained until about I
9 o'clock, when he retired to his room
Half an hour later Mrs. Stone heard a
queer noise proceeding from her father's <
Bleeping apartment. She hastened to j
his room and found him in a swoon, from
which he did not rally, ilyir.K in a few !
minutes. His physician had warned him |
that his heart affection would -cause sud- i
den death and he was prepared for the j
crisis.
Tin- deceased was a native of Maine and
63 years of age. The surviving relatives
are three sonsâ Charles 1,. (Hidden and j
Ben R. Glidden of San Francisco/and Eu- !

Mr. Glidden located in Marysviile in the

ALL DEPENDS
ON THE TOTE
FOR ALTGELD
Chicago's Peculiar Mayoralty
Contest Will Be Decided
To-Day.
CANDIDATES' CLAIMS
Adherents of Harrison and Carter
Are Hopeful and There Is Promise
of Bloodshed at the Polls.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 3.â The vote to be
polled by John P. Altgeld in the Mayor
alty election to-morrow is admitted by
all parties to be a most undecided fac
tor, and yet it is the thing upon which
all three candidatesâ Harrison (Demo
crat), Carter (Republican), and Altgeld
(Independent Democrat) are basing
their hopes of final success. The Alt
geld men say that their candidate, who
is standing upon the Chicago platform,
will secure the straight Silver Demo
cratic vote, and will certainly be
elected. They allow him 140,000 votes.
In the headquarters of the Harrison
faction to-night there is the greatest
confidence. They say that there is not
the slightest doubt of the Mayor's re
election. They give him 180,000 votes,
as against 100,000 for Carter and 30,000
for Altgeld. In the Republican camp
the estimate is: Carter, 130,000; Harri
son, 120,000, *nd Altgeld, 80,000. They
claim that Altgeld will draw enough
votes from Harrison to elect Carter be
yond a doubt. The Democrats agree
that there will be something of a de
fection in the Harrison ranks in view
of Altgeld, but say that the votes to
come to Harrison from the Republican
ranks will more than offset whatever
he will lose by the candidacy of Alt
geld. '
The sober discussion is, however, in
all the headquarters that there has
been seldom, if ever, an election in
Chicago so difficult to forecast with ac
curacy as this one. Not one of the par
ties has made an attempt to poll votes
prior to election and their estimates
are for the most part guesswork. It is
admitted on all sides that the size of
the Altgeld vote will determine the re
sult. If he secures close to 100,000 votes
It means the election of Carter, the
Republican candidate. If he has under
40,000, and the estimates run all the
way" between the figures, Harrison will
be elected. If Altgeld has much over
100,000 he is likely to be elected, but the
majority of politicians in both the
Democratic and Republican rank? Bay
that they have little fear of his elec
tion. It is the way his vote is to turn
the final result that is disturbing them.
The Republicans .are expecting
trouble at the polls to-morrow r in sev
eral wards particularly in the First and
Eighteenth. They say the Democrats
have "colonized" extensively; that they
know the "colonists," and under no cir
cumstances will they be permitted to
vote.
The Democracy in the wards men
tioned deny any illegal work and say
every Democrat who comes to the polls
shall cast his vote.
The Michigan Election.
DETROIT, Mich., April 3.-To-day's
election in Michigan has not shown any
marked change in the general political
complexion of the State, which is nor
mally Republican, but the result show*
quite heavy Democratic gains in some or
the larger cities, notably so in Detroit,
Grand Rapids, Saginaw, Jackson and
Kalamazoo. On a generally light vote the
Republicans hold their own in the smaller
and throughout the rural districts.
Circuit Judges were elected in thirty-six
judicial districts. Of these about 'two
thirds of the new Judges, who are elected
for the six-year terms, are Republicans.
The Republicans re-elected Judge C. B
Grant as Justice of the Supreme Court
by a majority of at least 20,000. They
also elected Henry S. Dean and Eli S.
Sutton as Regents of Michigan University
by somewhat greater majorities.
Elections in Montana.
ANACONDA, Mont., April 3.â The re
sult of the Butte election is a majority
of about iiftO for McCarthy, the Demo
cratic candidate for Mayor. The Repub
licans elect the. City Treasurer, Police
Magistrate and four or five of the eight
Aldermen. In Miasoula Webster (R.) is
re-elected Mayor and a Republican ma
jority in the Cnuncll is elected. Collins

Keokuk Goes Democratic.
KEOKUK, lowa, April 3.â The Demo
crats carried the city by 75, electing

AMERICANS IN NEED OF
PROTECTION AT BLUEFIELDS
NEW YORK, April 3.â A New Orleani
special to the Sun says: At a meeting held
this evening by the New Orleans mer
chants engaged in the Central American
trade. E. H. Merrick and Mr. Steinhart
of the Bluefields Banana Company and
Julius Friedlander of the New Orleans
and Central American Trading Company
were appointed a committee to go to
Washington to lay before the President a
statement of the condition of affairs in
Nicaragua and to ask him to send a man
of-war thither and intervene for the pro
tection of American interests. The com
mittee left for Washington soon after the
meeting.
The meeting was held in consequence
of a cable dispatch received from Blue
fields, Nicaragua, via Port Limon, Costa
Kica, to which place it was taken by
water in order to escape the censorship
of the Nicaraguan Government. The dip
patch said that General Torres, Governor
of the coast province, had made a de
mand on American merchants and steam
snip companies for payment a second
time of all customs duties paid by them
to the de facto government during the
.1 revolution. In case of refusal, he
announced that he would take military
possession of all American stores and
hold them. The American merchants pro
test to the UnKed States against this ac
tion as ruinous to interests representing
millions of dollars of investment.

CANADA IS NOW
WITHOUT DEFENSES
General Hutton Declares the Do
minioo Has No Army Worthy
of the Name.
BUFFALO, N. T., April 3.â A special from Quebec says: It is now
publicly admitted that the Dominion of Canada is without defenses, and
has no army worthy of the name. This statement is made upon the au
thority of the head of the supposed army, the general who commands
it. General Hutton is a first-class imperial officer who has seen active
service in various parts of the empire, notably in Egypt, where he has
served with Gordon, Wood and Kitchener. He has been newly appoint
ed to the command of the Canadian forces, and his first official report
upon the condition of the supposed army has created more than a mild
sensation, both in military, civil and political circles in Canada. The
general declines to speak of the force at all as an army. In fact, he de
clares that it is not an army.

LONDON, April 4.â The Daily Mall's
correspondent at Gothenberg, Sweden, re
ferring to the warlike preparations of
Norway, says:
"The only possible object of these prep

whose infantry are armed with obsolete

BONNEAU VINDICATED.
SAN RAFAEL, April 3.-The prophecy
that ex-County Clerk Bonneau would re
ceive a vindication on the allegation of
defalcation In office at the hands of the
Board of Supervisors was fulfilled to
d;iy. Individually the board scoffed at
the thought that a man who had cred
itably filled tho position of County Cle-rk
for fourteen years would descend to the
taking of a paltry $123 out of the treas
ury and. take thirteen years in which to
do it. The attention of the board was
drawn to the matter hy a communication
from District Attorney Mclsaac contain
ing the fact as published.
Mr. Brinneau was on hand and told how
the discrepancies occurred. He said the
law required all marriage certificates to
be recorded within thirty days after the
ceremony and its non-observance led to
the trouble. County Clerk Graham cer
tified that Mr. Bonneau had had the books
experted and made good me shortage.
The board placed all documents on file
and dropped the case at* once. Chairman
Barr said after the session that Bon
neau's explanation was fully satisfactory
and the circumstances warranted the
matter being pusheS no farther.
PRINTING-HOUSE COMBINE.
LOS ANGELES, April 3.â A printing
house combine, which has taken in nearly
all the job printing establishments in Los
Angeles, has been formed here. During
the last eighteen rtionths rumblings of the
approaching storm have been heard. Big
printing houses have been compelled to
decrease their dividends owing to en
croachment of the small offices on their
business. The, formation of the trust be
gan about three months ago. All but six
of the forty printing establishments are
in the combine. Each member of the
trust has given a bond of $50 to be paid
in case of infringement of the rules gov
erning prices. One of the results of the
combination has been the knocking out of
the union label, which has been used in
all union offices during the last three
years. Non-union offices refused to enter
the combine unless the union label was
abolished.

AGAIN FEEDING AT
THE PUBLIC CRIB
Boarder Mackenzie Once
More "On Earth."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 3.â The announce
ment of the appointment of John D.
Mackenzie as chief deputy by Ccipnty
Auditor Thomas F. Morrison has
caused consternation among the tax
payers and citizens of this city and
county. The Rea forces were over
whelmingly defeated at the last elec
tion and the reform parties thought the
ex-Game Warden was ousted from thy
public crib for good. Instead, Macken
zie, who for years has been ex-Boss
Rea's lieutenant, has landed on his feet
again. This time he is cold-blooded in
his demands, and has made Auditor
Morrison create a place especially for
him.
When Auditor Veuve's death occurr
ed a couple of weeks ago Mackenzie de
manded the place of the Supervisors,
who had the filling of the vacancy. Su
pervisors Rea and Austin consented,
but Supervisor Stern demurred. Stern,
who owes his position to the gang,
pleaded with Mackenzie not to insist
on haying the place. He said it would
kill him politically and ruin his busi
ness as a dealer in harness and saddles.
Stern consented to vote for any one
Mackenzie would name and suggested
Morrison, who he said would make
Rea's lieutenant a deputy. This bar
gain was finally clinched. Mrs. Veuve,
the widow of the late Auditor, had
many friends, and they insisted on her
being made a deputy. Morrison con
sented to this.
Morrison was appointed by the Su
pervisors and to-day he appointed both
Mrs. Veuve and Mackenzie as deputi-s.
Heretofore the Auditor has not had |
any deputies. The salary is $4000 a
year. Out of this it is said Mrs. Veuve
will get $1000 and Mackenzie and Mor
rison will divide the balance equally.
This partnership will give Santa Clara
County three servants instead of one
at the old salary.
Morrison is also Police and Fire Com
missioner, and if this alleged co-part
nership extends to this office there still
remains plenty of work for the reform
forces of the Good Government League,
Democrats and Populists.

' SHE TELLS OF HER DELIVERANCE.*
How many men and women there are
who suffer from functional heart dis-
ease and how pleasing it is to know
that a remedy has been found that re-
duces the fatalities from this dreaded
disease to a minimum. Here comes the
interesting story of Miss Florence Mer-
ritt, a prominent young lady of New-
ark, N. J. She says:
I was all run down in health and as
â¢ pale as death. My eyes were sunken, and
my cheeks were hollow. Had no appetite
and was so weak that I could hardly drag
myself around. I suffered from heart
disease, complicated with stomach trou-
ble, and feared that every day would be
my last. A friend advised me of the great
Hudyan remedy, and I took it. I am to-
day a perfect picture of health. Hudyan
Is an honest and reliable remedy and. will
cure. MISS FLORENCE MERRITT.
Such praise as the above comes to us
every day. Hudyan is curing men and
women in every State of this great
Union. ' Hudyan cures because it
reaches every nerve and tissue in the
human organism. If you suffer . from
stomach disorder, Hudyan will act
upon the mucous membrane and will
stimulate the gastric follicles to action.
If you suffer from liver trouble, Hud-
yan will correct the action of this large
gland, will divert the bile from the
blood into its proper channels, thus re-
lieving the bowels. If you are a victim
of kidney disease, Hudyan will assist
their action, which is to take from the
blood the impurities that poison the
system and breed disease. If your
nervous system is wrecked, it matters
not the cause, and you suffer from
weakness, dizzy spells, sleeplessness,
loss of appetite, and the many other
symptoms due to a broken-down nerv-
ous system, Hudyan is an invigorant
that never fails. If you are weak and
emaciated, you will find Hudyan to be
| a splendid tonic. You will not be dis-
| appointed in Hudyan.

â  â  â  : :VALIDITY OF WAR
REVENUE LAW IS
FULLY SUSTAINED
United States Supreme Court
Upholds the Right of Congress
to Impose the Tax.
WASHINGTON, April Much interest
was manifested by lawyers and others in
the decision of the cases in the United
States Supreme Court to-day involving
the validity of the war revenue law. The
opinion v- La handed down by Justice
Peckham, who orally announced on a bare
summary of the written document. The
opinion, as prepared for preservation,
took up the various phases of the sub
ject, holding the law constitutional as ap
plied, not only to stock exchanges, but
to livestock yards as well, the principle
being the same in all cases.
The cases were those of James N. Young vÂ«.
James Ames, United States Marshal; petition
for habeas corpus by George R. Nichols, peti
; tioner; Edwin S. Skillen, appellant, vs. the
Marshal, and Charles Hingwersen. plaintiff in
error, vs. the United States. The oases all
came from the Chicago â :â¢â :.:' courts. These
cases involve especially the Invalidity of the
tax provided by the war revenue act upon sales
and contracts to sell merchandise upon* sx
changes, boards of trade or similar places. The
war revenue act â¢â < quires a memorandum to be
made of the transaction and a stamp .v:i\. J.
the amount of which is measured c>y the stand
ard of value. The cases of George K. Nicholu,
appellant: of Nichols, petitioner, and of Skil
len, appellant, present all the phases involved
In stock transactions on the Board ol Trade in
Chicago. The case of G. \V. Hlnperson In
volves the question whether the Union Stock
Yards of Chicago is an exchange or similar
place, making sales taxable. The court in us
opinion sustained the validity of the tax. ana
holds also that the stockyards is a place simi
lar to an exchange, making Its transactions
liable to the tax.
. The case was argued by ex-Secretary Car
lisle and Mr. Koblr.s of Chicago for the peti
tioners, and by J. K. Richards. Solicitor Gen
eral, lor the Government. Carlisle contended
that the tax on sales of exchanges is a direct
â¢tax. first, because It is virtually a tax upon the
property sold, and, second, because the tax
I cannot be shifted, but must be paid by the
teller on the exchange. It was also insisted
that it the tax Is an indirect tax It lacks uni
formity, because not imposed upon all sales
whenever made. The point was also made that,
if- an Indirect tax. it is a stamp tax on docu
ments, and that Congress has no power to re
quirr a written memorandum to be made upon
' transactions within a State for the purpose of
taxing such memorandums.
â¢ The court, in its opinion, carefully discusses
all -these objections and overrules them. It
1. Ids that it is not a direct tax, but a duty
or excis-e laid upon the privilege, opportunity
or facility offered at boards of trade or ex
changes for the prosecution of the business
â¢mentioned in the act.
'â¢It i.Â«," the court further says, "not a tax
upon the members of the exchange nor upon
the membership therein, nor - it a tax upon
tales generally. The act limits the tax to sales
at any exchanse or board of trade or other
similar place, and Us fair meaning Is to im
jtfise a duty upon *hcse privileges or facilities
there found and made use of."
' The exceptional facilities offered at such
places affords, the court says, a just ground
lor classification for purposes of taxation by
Congress of transactions there. The flexible
'character of the taxing power and the possi
bility of adapting it to changing conditions is
described by the court, II distinctly holding
'That In order to tax a privilege or facility In
jured, it Is not necessary that it should be
" i reared by the Government, and the require
ment of a memorandum Is upheld because it
Ts necessary for the collection of a tax. The
tax Is pronounced uniform because it applies
to all " who enjoy the special privileges or
facilities Incident to the transaction of busi
ness at boards of trade and similar places.

existing between them are insubstantial in bo
far as this point is concerned."
In the matfr nf the petition for a writ of
habeas corpus, the petition was denied, while
in the other cases the judgments of the lower
courts were affirmed.
In ppeaklnK of the general powers of Con
, to taxation, Justice Peckham said:
â â¢In searching for proper subjects of taxa

Government, i">>ngress must have the ripht
The manner in which the business
of the country is actually transacted; how,
among oth^r thingo. the exchange of commodi
ties Is effected; what facilities tor the conduct
of business exist; what is their nature and how
they operate; and what, if a;iy, practicable and
recognizable distinction there may be between
a transaction which Is effected by means of
using certain facilities an.l one where such fa
cilities are not available to the parties to the
same kind of a transaction. Having the power
to recognize these various facts, it must also
i that Congress If Justified If not com

tlon to legislate with direct reference to the
r\isting conditions of trade and business
throughout the country and to the manner in
which they are carried on."
The Chicago Board of Trade is treated In the
opinion as a type of boards of trade all over
the country, the size of the chief institution
only serving to emphasize its importance.
"It Is common knowledge that these ex
changes encourage and promote honest and fair
dealing among their members: that they pro

the exchange for such purposes. â¢ â¢ â¢ Nor is
there any doubt that these exchanges facilitate
exchanges of purchase and sale, and It would
seem that such facilities or privileges, even
though not granted by the Government or by
a State, ought nevertheless to be rec gnlzed as
existing facts and to be subject to the judg
ment of C.ngress .'us fit matters for taxation."
"The tax." he said, "is not a direct tax
within the meaning of the constitution, but it
Is in the nature of a duty or excise. The

like this may be increased or diminished by
the extent to which the privilege or facility is

make the tax a direct one. â¢ * * We 't" not

to be sold Is th-Â» same, whether for Immediate

On the point of discrimination It was re
marked that "a purchase occurs whenever a
sale Is effected. nr..l to say that a purchaser
at an exchanpe sale must be taxed for th"
facilities made use -' in making the purchase,
or else that the tax on the seller is void, is
pimply to insist upon doubling the tax. Nor <s
it necessary to tax the use of the privilege un
der all circumstances in order to render the
tnx valid upon Its use in particular cases. We
see no reason why it should be necessary to
tax a privilege whenever It Is used for any
purpose, or else not to tax It at all. It is not
In its nature indivisible. â¢ â¢ â¢ In holding
that the tax under consideration is a tax on
the privilege used in making sales at an ex

upon the memorandum required by the
upon which the stamp is to be placed. The act
does no! assume in any manner to interfere
with the laws of the State in relation to the

might have adopted some other means for col

CHICAGO, April 3.â The Record to
morrow will say: The combination of
manufacturers of merchant bar iron,
upon which Chicago promoters have been
at work for several weeks, is practically
consummated, and within a few days the
properties will be taken over by a cor

tak^n in Chicago, but the New York In
terest will be the largest of outside capi
tal. The banking houses of Dominick &
I'U-kerman and William C. Sheldon & Co.
of that city have organized the under,
writing syndicate. The company will
have a cash working capital of $6,500,000
and all plants taken over will be free of

WASHINGTON, April 3.â The Presi
dent and Secretary Hay have been giv
ing consideration to the selection of a
representative of the United States
Government on the Samoan commis
sion. He will not be a member of either
the Senate or House of Representatives,
according to present light 3. It is ex
pected that the effort will be to find
some person thoroughly familiar with
the issues likely to be presented in the
settlement of this Samoan dispute.
It is regarded by the State Depart
ment as essential that the commission
be appointed at the earliest possible
moment.
Many cable dispatches have been
passing between Washington and Lon
don in regard to the Samoan settle
ment. The main point is on determin
ing exactly the extent of authority
which the high commission is to pos
sess, Lord Salisbury desiring all uncer
tain points first cleared up and an ex
act definition of what the commission
is to do before committing Great Brit
ain. The Kritish Government is as I
ready as vhe United States or Germany
to accept the general principle of com
missioners, but it wants to knpw in ad
vance as to the power of the commis
sion.
The indications are that the British
authorities will give their adherence to
the agreement within a day or two,
but it is stated that there is- still a
chance, although a very slight one,
that the agreement may not be con
cluded.
The present negotiations are concen
trated on three main points, viz.: First,
is the commission to report, or is it to
â xecutive authority to administer
as well as to negotiate, and if so what
is the extent of its executive power;
second, will the action of the commis
sion be determined by a majority or
will unanimous action be required;
third, if a majority determination is
arranged what safeguards are to be
provided to in?ure unanimous execu
tion. This last pomt â as between ma
jority or unanimous action â is a vexing
one and is the one which has arisen
between the consular officials in .Sa
moa, and it Is evident that Lord Salis
bury hesitates to assent to any agree
ment which may renew this contro
versy.
An agreement upon King Oscar as
final arbitrator would obviate a dead
lock, but this, while proposed unoffi
cially during the recent discussions, has
not been assented to officially.
FOUGHT TO THE DEATH
BEFORE THEIR CHILDREN
CHICAGO, April 3.â Before his two chil
dren, aged two and four, Joseph Brown
was stabbed to death to-day by his wife.
The murder was the outcome of a family
quarrel. Brown had beaten and kicked ;
his wife and threatened to kill her with a |
butcher knife that was lying on a table. ,
"When Brown made a move toward the
knife Mrs. Brown snatched it herself. â¢
Brown raised his foot and kicked her. but
Bhe plunged forward with the knife, strik- \
ing him fairly In the stomach. Maddened
with frenzy and pain the two battled
bark and forth, the husband kicking and
striking and the wife plunging the knife
into her husband until with a fifth blow
he fell backward dead. Brown was
stabbed five timesâ once under the chin,
twice in the stomach and twice in the
right side. All made big, gaping wounds,
and any one of them would have proved
fatal. "Brown was a packing house em
ploye.
MISSING FROM GILROY.
GILROY, April 3.â Paul Cupola, a hand
some Slavonian, about 25 years old, has
disappeared from Gilroy, leaving behind
a score or more of creditors. Paul worked
as a cook at the Star Restaurant. Early
yesterday morning, after his all night's
work, he donned his new Easter suit and
hired a horse and buggy from F. Fitzger
ald's livery stable. He said he was going
fishing.
On Friday and Saturday Cupola went to
several of his friends and acquaintances
and borrowed various sums ranging from
$1 to $20. It is estimated he obtained over
$100 in this way. On Saturday night H. R.
Eschcnbnrg left a sack containing $193 15
%vith Paul for safe keeping. This Cupola
took with him.
As night came on his employer grew
suspicious. The officers in adjoining towns
notified by telephone. The rig was
located In Watsonville, where Cupola had
left it, paying for a night's feed. He told
the Watsonville stable man he was going
to Santa Cruz. It is supposed he went to
Santa Cruz and either boarded a steamer
or the narrow guage train for San Fran
cisco.

Military Burial of the
Troops Who Fell.
PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION
i
ORDERS DISPLAY OF OLD GLORY
THROUGHOUT THE NATION.
Full Military Honors to Be Accorded
During the Burial of the Bodies
From the West
Indies.
Special Dispatch to The CalL.
WASHINGTON, April 3.âArrange
ments have been practically completed
for the funeral services on the occasion
of the reinterment in the Arlington
Cemetery at 2 o'clock Thursday after
noon of the remains of about 350 sol
diers and civilians who lost their lives
as a result of wounds or disease in the
campaigns of Santiago and Porto Rico.
The services will be of the simplest
character, being confined to the com
mitment service conducted by Post
Chaplain Charles W. Freeland, who has
been summoned here from the military
post at Fort Monroe for that purpose.
Full military honors will be paid the
memory of the patriotic dead and all
regular troops in this vicinity, the Dis
trict National Guard and a battalion of
marines will participate in the cere
mony at the cemetery. Colonel Francis
L. Guenther of the Fourth Artillery
will have command of the military es
cort exercises.
The remains of 150 of the heroes of
the war have already been deposited in
tents near the spot selected for their
interment, and it is expected that the
remaining 200 bodies will be brought on
from Jersey City to-morrow or next
day.
The President and most of the offi
cials of the administration in this city
will attend the funeral services. Presi
dent McKinley to-day issued the fol
lowing executive order in connection
with the interments:
It is fitting that In behalf of the nation
tributes of honor be paid to the memories
of the nol>lÂ« men who lost their lives in
their country's service during the late
war with Spain. It is the more fitting,
Inasmuch as In consonance with the spirit
i t our free Institutions and in obedience
to the most exalted promptings of pat
riotism, those who were sent to other
shores to do battle for their country's
honor under their country's flag w< nt
freely from every quarter of our beloved
land. Each soldier, each sailor, parting
from home ties and putting behind him
private, interests in the presence of the
stern emergency of unsought war with
an alien foe, was an individual type of
devotion of the citizen to the state which
makes our nation strong in unity and in
action.
Those who died in another land left in
many homes the undying memories that
attend the heroes <>f all ages, li was fti
ting that with the advent of peace, won
by their sacrifice, their bodies should be
gathered with tender care and restored
to home and kindred. This has !><â â¢ n
done with the dead of Cuba and Porto
Rico. Those of the Philippines still rest
where they fell, watched over by their
surviving comrades ;ind crowned with the
love of a Krateful nation.
The remains of many brought to our
shores have been delivered to their fami
lies for private burial. But for others of
the brave officers and men who perished
there has been reserved Interment in
grounds sacred to the soldiers and sailors
among the tributes of military honor and
national mourning they have so well de
served.
I therefore order: That upon the arri
val of the cortege at the National Ceme
tery at Arlington all proper military and
naval honors be paid to the dead heroes;
that suitable ceremonies shall attend
their interment; that the customary sa
lute of mourning be fired at the cemetery
and that on the same day at 2 o'clock,
Thursday, the Oth day of April, the na
tional flag be displayed at half-mast on
all public buildings, forts, camps and
public vessels of the T'nited States and
that at 12 o'clock, noon, of said day. all
the departments of the Government at
"Washington shall be closed.
WILLIAM Mc'vTNLEY,
Executive Mansion. April 3, 1599.

retary of War Meiklejohn issued this
order:
The remains of officers and soldiers who
lost their lives in the war witli Spain
during the operations in Cuba and Porto
Rico will be interred with due and fitting
ceremonies In the National Cemetery at

Warren F. Leland, who was operated
upon for appendicitis on Sunday after

GAGE MAKES FOES
OF WOMEN FOLK
Denies Them the Right
to Vote.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 3.â When the
Governor pocketed the bill providing
that women be allowed the franchise
in educational matters he destroyed his
popularity with the fair sex of Los
Angeles. As the matter cannot be
brought to an issue again for two years
the women who labored for the law and
the many men who expressed approval
question Gage's judgment.
Mrs. M. E. Threlkeld, an earnest ad
vocate of the principles embodied in the
bill, expresses regret that the Gover
nor could not see its value.
"In Kansas," she said, "the Legisla
ture passed a bill permitting women to
vote for school directors. I can say
from personal knowledge it was the
best thing for the schools. Women on
tli school board do well. They always
pa: :i:ore attention to the sanitary con
(ir us of the schools than do the men."
. .rs. C. B. Bradtield, drawing super
intendent of the Los Ansreles schools,
â  and Mrs. Gertrude Paidon, special
I teacher of music in the city schools, ex
; pressed the belief that the bill ought
Ito have been signed. The schools
I would be benefited by the measure.
I They say the matter should have re
: ceived greater attention than to be sub
| jected to the treatment accorded by the
; Governor.
"It would have been a good thing
without a doubt," said Professor James
A. Foshay. "I have seen the experi
ment tried in the East. It wo"uld have
worked to the perfect satisfaction of
everybody concerned. If women vote
for school directors the board is kept
out of politics. From experience I say
women use good judgment in these
matters. It is to be regretted the Gov
ernor did not sign the bill."
GAGE AROUSES THE
IRE OF MONTEREYANS
MONTEREY. April 3.â Great indigna
tion is expressed here over the recent ac
tion of Governor Gage in vetoing the
Colton Hall bill. The bill was presented by
Monterey's Assemblyman F. P. Feliz, and
provided for the appropriation of $2500 of
the State's money for restoring the build
ing and beautifying the grounds of Colton
Hall, California's first Capitol. The
amount wa.s asked for to supplement a
subscription already raised by the citi
zens of Monterey city and county, which
alone, though liberal, was inadequate for
the necessary work. The bill tirst asked
for JSOOO, and it was then the plan to con
vert the old building into a museum oi
California history, bwrf this project waa
abandoned for the time and the amount
of State aid asked for was reduced to
$2500, with the understanding that the
Governor would sign the bill.
This is the second time within the last
decado the restoration of California's
most historic landmark hap been frowned
down by the commonwealth's chief ex
ecutive, Governor Markham having
vetoed a similar bill during -his adminis
tration. The Montereyans say they will
not despair, but will renew the fight next
session, hoping for better success.
In the meantime the historic old build-
Ing grows daily more dilapidated, and un
less something" is done it will ere long be
past the point of restoration.
CRIPPLED DURING A GALE.
HALIFAX, N. S., April 3.â The steamer
Charing Cross, from Philadelphia for
Ipswich, arrived in port this evening
with the steamer Forest Brook in tow.
The Forest Brook is from Leith for
Hampton Roads. She has lost her tail
shaft and propeller and possibly the stern
tube is damaged.
The mishap occurred Friday last about
noon, 250 miles southeast of this port, in
a howling gale and a high sea. The
weather was so heavy that no effort could
>c made after the shaft snapped to secure
the propeller and it was lost.
Flood Danger Is Past.
WOODLAND, April 3.â Further danger
from flood water is not expected. There
is considerable water in Sycamore Slough,
but there is very little on the farming
land in District 108, and that little will
soon be removed. At Knights Landing
the river fell two and a half inches Sun
day night. It now stands 14 feet 9Vi
inches. At the Woods break the water
has receded about two feet and more than
a foot and a half is now running out into
the basin. The water in the basin Is re
ceding rapidly. If all the breaks on the
Yolo side had been open during the big
spring, freshet, gralntlelds in the vicinity
of Swingle station that now look well
would be three feet under water and
ruined, and a large district in Solano
County that is still safe would be devas
tated.
Suhivan Easily a Winner.
NEW YORK, April 3.â At the Green
wood Athletic Club to-night "Spike" Sul
livan defeated George (Mysterious) Ker
win of Chicago in seven rounds. The mo
ment the men stepped into the ring they
got together. Kerwin letting his arms fly
like flails, without any attempt at science.
This puzzled Spike a good deal, but He got
his man's measure and .soon was plainly
a winner, hitting Kerwin freely. The lat
ter wasted his strength and weakened
greatly, in the sixth and seventh rounds
Sullivan sailed in and finally, with a right
hand smash on the jaw, knocked Kerwin
helpless after fifty-five seconds of fighting
in the seventh.
Byers Knocks Out Goff.
NEW YORK, April 3.â George Byers of
Boston got the decision over Charlie Goff
of Oregon in the second round of what
was to have been a twenty round bout at
the Broadway Athletic Club to-night.
They met at 150 pounds. In the second
round Goff landed a straight left on the
mouth and swung over Byers' head. By
ers swung left to mouth and right to ribs
and a moment later put a solid left hook
to the jaw, scoring a clean knock-down.
Goff arose groggy and Byers started to
finish him, knocking Goff down twice
more, when Referee Tommy White
stopped the fight and awarded the deci
sion to Byers.
WARDEN HALE TO
WALK THE PLANK
Will Not Remain at San
Quentin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RAN QUENTIN PRISON, April 3.â
Warden Hale has relinquished all hope
of being reappointed, and admits so
with seeming frankness. He has fought
his. fight and now realizes that he has
lost.
Governor Gage intends to install
Martin Aguirre of Los Angeles as war
den, whatever may be the cost. But
Hale still clings to straws, as may be
gathered even from his admissions. He
says he is not a candidate for the war
denship, but in the same breath certi
fies to the fact that he is in love with
his job, as he terms it, and will occu
py his position as long as the prison
directors see fit to keep him there.
"Just say in The Call for me," said
Hale this evening, "that I am not a
candidate for warden on account of ill
health and have so notified the presi
dent of the board of directors. My of
fice does not expire until April 20, be
cause four years ago I held over until
the 20th of the month for various rea
sons. I may hold until June 1 or even
July 1, on account of the volume of bags
to be sold and other business to be
cleared up.
"Whether I stay longer than April 20
or not depends upon the pleasure of the
board. If I were a well man I should
stand for another appointment, because
I like the job, but my physician tells
me I must have a long rest. There re
mains a vast amount of business to be
cleared up. Since the publication in
The Call of the action taken by the
board to circumvent a suspected
scheme to cinch farmers by a corner
on bags a million have been sold in lots
of 5000. We sold 170,000 to-day. Again
I desire to say that the length of time
I remain warden depends entirely upon
the prison directors."
For reasons not stated the directors
have postponed their meeting from
next Saturday to the 15th inst. As
Manuel Chavez is to hang on that day
it is possible the meeting may take
place a week from next Wednesday or
Thursday. So sure are the guards that
Aguirre is to be elected wardenKhat
many are already preparing to leave
the prison.
CITIZEN* OF REDDING
WILL BE ARRESTED
Accused of Having Violated the Pro-
visions of the City Fire
Ordinances.
REDDING, April 3.-According to City
Attorney Watson, a half-dozen of Red
ding's prominent citizens will be placed
under arrest to-morrow for having vio
lated the express provisions of the city
fire ordinances with reference to the Ar
mory Hall. The Board of Trustees passed
an ordinance requiring the building as
sociation which owns the hall to place
stand pipes and hose in the building, and
the directors of the association ignored
the order. Last Tuesday night a local
talent show was given in the hall in spite
of the order of the Board of Trustees.
The city fathers were tricked by a bluff
at complying with the order. The Trustees
became indignant and resolved that the
hall should remain closed hereafter until
the order were complied with.
Another local talent show was billed
for to-night. To-day on injunction was
granted in the Superior Court restraining
the Trustees and the City Marshal from
interfering in any way with the show or
the hall. An application was made by
the City Attorney to have the injunction
dissolved, but the application was denied
by Judge Ellison of Tehama County, who
presided in the Superior Court, Judge
Sweeney being disqualified. C> AY. Her
zinger. the manager of the hail, refused
to open the doors unless he was given a
written guarantee that he would not suf
fer damages in case he were arrested and
fined. This guarantee was given. He ac
cordingly opened the doors and to-morrow
morning arrests will be made.
WILL NEVER BOX AGAIN.
Jim Corbett Says He Has Left the
Fistic Arena for Good.
NEW YORK. April 3.â Jim Corbett has
decided to abandon the ring. He an
nounced to-day that he would never box
again, and in future would pay strict at
tention to his new business. Corbett said:
"I am doing well and do not need to fight
any more. I have a fine business and will
devote all my time to it. It is better than
acting and fighting and keeps my mind
occupied. And then, to sum it up, I am
located in New York, where I have al
ways longed to be."
OLD MAN COMMITS MURDER.
Stabs a Fellow Inmate in the Sacra-
mento County Hospital.
PACRAMENTO, April 3.-At the Coun
ty Hospital this evening an old inmate
named John O'Neill stabbed and killed
a patient named William Howard. O'Neil
had been in town during the day and went
back to the hospital quite late under the
Influence of lio.uor. Howard waited on
the table. O'Neil was angry because he
was late and his supper did not suit him.
He got into an altercation with Howard,
seized him by the waist and stabbed him
twice in the abdomen. Howard died be
fore his wounds could be examined.
O'Neil was arrested and taken to the
County Jail.
Torn by Exploding Dynamite.
ANGELS CAMP, April 3.â Christopher
Granda, an Austrian, was blown to
pieces by the explosion of a half-dozen
sticks of dynamite in the Utica mine
last night. Granda and his partner had
drilled a number of holes and Granda
was carrying the powder to be used in
blasting them from the station when the
dynamite exploded. A lighted lamp was

The chief consulting physician of the fa-

of Buffalo, N. V., Dr. R. V. Pierce, has de-

A woman writing to Dr. Pierce regarding

GAS FOR THE
PEOPLE AT A
MINIMUM RATE
Board of Supervisors Makes a
Startling Reduction.
Work Will Be Commenced To-Day on New
Pesthouseâ Heavy License for
Boxing Shows.
The price of gas to the consumers of
this city was reduced by the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday from $1 75 per thou
sand feet to $1 10. This revolutionary ac
ticn. in view of the recent attitude of the
members, came ;fs a sensation near the
end of a long wrangle over the fixing of
rates. It was proposed in jest ami passed
before the majority members of the board
realized what had happened.
There was a long and acrimonious de
bate on the subject of fixing gas rates to
be raid by the city. This the members
took up as a legacy from the board meet
ing of last week.
After a discussion extending over an
hour, during which every resolution hay
' ing for its object the fixing of rates had
been voted down, the members found
.Themselves back at their original start
ing place. As the majority report on gas
investigation, presented by Supervisors
Collins and Auriiige, had been lost the
Mayor ruled the minority report of Su
pervisor Perrault in order.
.This provided that a rate of $135 per
thousand feet be charged private con
sumers. Supervisor Holland was opposed
to this as not being fair remuneration for
the company, lie suggested, ironically,
that the board might nx the rate at Jl 10,
and moved to amend Dr. Perraulfs mo
tion by fixing that amount as the legal
charge to be made.
As every motion had been lost during
the discussion. Mr. Holland, apparently
â¢to help the joke along, voted in me ar-
Jirmative. Supervisor .black alsu voted in
the affirmative. Supervisors Perrault,
Lackmann, Byington, Heyer and Dca^y
voted with the two men who had been on
the opposing side and the battle was won.
The men voting in the negative were Su
pervisurs Kalben, Phelps. Coilins and At
tridge. Supervisor Aigeltinger was ex
cused.
After the meeting Supervisor Holland
explained that he took the radical course
he Id to compel the gas company to go
to the courts for relief. He said no" money
can be paid until the Supreme Court
passes upon the bills and the contract be
tween -the company and the city.
The new rate goes into effect to-day.
It is expected the company will take steps
at once to test the legality of the board's
action, presumably t>n the ground that
the rate as fixed is not reasonable com
pensation for the services rendered.
During the discussion that led up to the
foregoing action the majority report pre
sented Dy Supervisor Collins was dis
sected by Supervisor Byington. He asked
If the city, sing 800 electric lights, was
not entitled to a lower rate than private
consumers using only one light. li said
the city pays Jo 50 a light, "While private
Individuals pay JJ 50 and $3.
Mr. Collins would not accept Mr. By
ington's figures, saying he knew nothing
as to their accuracy. Mr. Byington also
asked that statements in toe majority
report to the effect that "the present
charges are fair and reasonable" and
that "wages will be reduced by every cor
poration in California" if the bills of the
company are reduced be stricken out.
Supervisor Holland insisted that no
matter what action the board might take
all the questions must be eventually de
cided by the Supreme Court.
Supervisor Perrault offered a resolution
that the Mutual Electric Light Company
be allowed to erect poles outside the fire I
limits. This drew a resolution from Su
pervisor Aigeltinger to the same effect.
Repeated efforts have been made to pass
this recently without . . ail. It would
have passed yesterday had Supervisor
Heyer, who favored it. remained at the
meeting. Seven votes were required to
carry it. Those in favor were: Holland,
I'errault, Lackmann, Byington, Deasy
and Aigeltinger. Opposed were: Kalben,
Black, Phelps. Collins and Attrldge.
The long discussion ended with a num
ber of votes on the question of preparing
specifications preliminary to inviting bids!
for lighting the city. After an extended
debate it was decided to allow the Street
Light Committee four weeks in which to i
prepare specifications.
An effort was made to fix the charge j
for lighting the streets at the $1 10 rate,
but It failed by a vote of 7 to 4.
Consideration of the offer of the Mutual
Electric Light Company to light the City
Hall for 40 per cent less than the present
charge was deferred one week.
The Supervisors wasted but little time
In disposing favorably of the report pre
sented by the joint committee appointed i
to investigate the Pesthouse. The report :
of the committee was:
Your joint committee on building and
hospital appointed by his Honor, the Mayor,
at a meeting of this board, on March 27,
1599, to visit and inspect the Pesthouse
and report on its condition, respectfully begs
leave to report as follows:
Your committee met vn Saturday, April
1, '' â â â '. and proceeded to the Pesthouse,
â which we thoroughly inspected, and found
the same to be In a wretched condition and
utterly unfit fcr the use and purposes for
which it was designed.
Your committee respectfully recom
mends that the building be destroyed by
fire and on its 6lte a new and modern build-
Ing be erected at a cost not to exceed $1000.
Respectfully submitted,
EDWARD HOLLAND,
A. ATT RIDGE,
F. <â¢ KALBEN,
HOW BLACK.
The only discussion was on the amount
to be allowed in carrying out this humani
tarian project. Dr. Perrault, out of the
knowledge he has gained in the practice
cf his profession, urged that the appro
priation be raised to $10,000. This would
permit of all the present ramshackle
buildings being razed, instead of only one
as at present provided for. He urged the
possibility of an epidemic, but the board
decided to spend $1000 immediately, and
instructed Chairman Holland of the â 
Building Committee to proceed with the
â¢work. Plans have already been prepared
at the Instance of Mr. Holland, who has i
taken a deep interest In the matter. He
announced that operations will be com
menced to-day.

â with the law passed by the Legislature
regulating boxing, according to which any

round boxing contests at any time. Super
visor Perrault presented a resolution fix- !
ing the -llcenee -to be paid in San Fran
cisco County at J-j **) per year. The matter â 
was referred; to City and County ttorney
Lane for his opinion as to whether the I

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1899.
SAYS PLUNKETT
MADE HER SEE
DAZZLING STARS
Mrs. Samuels Nursing
a Black Eye.
SHE SWEARS OUT A WARRANT
INSURANCE MAN CHARGED
WITH SERIOUS OFFENSE.
Shameful Fist Fight in a Sick Cham
ber Is Interrupted by the Alarm
ing Condition of the
Aged Patient.
John Plunkett, the "well known insur
ance man and manager of the Perm In
surance Company, is accused by Mrs.
Rachael Samuels of blacking her eye. In
addition, so she says, he swatted her in the
jaw and punched her in the back of the
neck. Yesterday Mrs. Samuels could not
without pain "do up" her back hair, and
an officer armed with a warrant was out
looking for Plunkett.
On Friday evening Mrs. Samuels was
calling on Mrs. Demu, the grandmother
of Plunketfs wife, at her residence. 1319
Mason street. Mrs. Demu was confined
MRS. RACHAEL SAMUELS.
to her bed. suffering with a eevere attru-k
of aneurism of the heart. While M l^.
Samuel? was chatting with the patient
.ccompanied by his wife, came
in. The insurance man, according to Mrs.
Samuels, greeted the invalid and then
..g directly in front of Mrs. Samuels
without recognizing her proceed
make himself comfortable in a seat at her
side.
"Aren't you going to speak to me, Mr.
Plunkett?" Mrs. Samuels inquired. "You
remember me, certainly; you have called
on me at my house."
Plunketfs reply, again according to
Mrs. Samuels, was a succession of foul
â¢ is, and he wound up by declaring
that he did not know Mrs. Samuels and
didn't want to know her, as she was not
a decent person such as he would recog
nize.
"Take back those words," cried the lady,
now thoroughly aroused, "or else you will
have to make an explanation to my hus-
band." . Â.
Plunketfs only "take back was an
other round of abuse, and then Mrs. S.i:.i
uels put out a lily white hand and smote
him on the cheek. m â 
The blow, had the effect of a red rag
flaunted in the face of an infuriated bull.
Piunkeit's strong right landed on tn
dusky cheek of the little lady and his
clenched fist beat a tattoo on tne back of
her neck As Mrs. Samuels fell to the
floor the sick grandmother sprang out of
bed and placing herself, in front of Plun
ketfs prostrate victim finally succeeded
in restoring peace.
yesterday morning Mrs. Samuels ap
peared before Judge Mogan and swore to
..â¢iplaint charging Plunkett with, as
sault and battery. The warrant was first
presented to Acting Police Judge Barry
for his signature, but Barry refused to
sign it on the ground that Plunkett was
a personal friend of his.
Mrs Samuels is the wife of S. A. Sam
uels and resides with her husband and
family at l'.*^ Union street When seen
yesterday Mr?. Samuels was nursing a
black eye. a swollen and discolored cheek
bruised neck.
"Plunkett struck me," Mrs. Samuels ex
plained, "because he is a coward, and h^
makes It his boast that he beats women.
While I was lying on the floor in that poor
old sick lady's room he told Mrs. Demu
and her daughter. Mrs. Etienne, who were
present, that he would lay me out. There
has been dissension in the family, and
Plunkett somehow Imagined that I was
responsible for the tales of his misdoings
that had come to the ears of his wife's
relatives. After he struck me I was com
pletely dazed for a moment, but when I
realised that that great big- coward had
laid his hand on me my first Impulse
to pick up a knife that was lying on a
table in the room and fling it at him. The
Piile frightened face of the sick woman
stopped me. I was afraid she might drop
dead any moment."
Mrs Samuels is a tiny, little lady, with
flaÂ«hing black eyes and soft, rounded
cheeks. The hand that smote the muscu
lar insurance agent fits easily into a five
and tlyree-quarter glove.
ANCIENT ORDER WORKMEN.
The Grand Lodge Will Meet in Na
tive Sons' Hall To-Day.
The Grand Lodge of the Ancient Order
of United Workmen will meet in annual
convention in Native Sons' Hall to-day

There will be present about three hundred
representatives from the 275 lodges of the
State, which have an aggregate member
ship of 20,400. which makes California the
sixth largest jurisdiction in the United

trenchment in the running expenses of
the order through its Grand Lodge offi
cers.
It is desired to secure for the office of
grand master workman one who will de
vote his whole time, to the order and be
paid a .salary that will compensate him
for such service. There will be some re
vision as to special deputies, who In the
past have, as many members say, "been
an expensive luxury." On Thursday
there will be held the election of grand
officers, and there is considerable specu
lation as to who will be elected. For the
office; of grand master workman the prom
inent candidates are William Vinter of
San Jose, who served two successive
terms, but was defeated last year, and J.
M. Collins of Fresno, at ' present grand
foreman. There will also be a contest for
grand recorder, Frank Poland, the incum
bent, and T. Carr of Nevada City being
the prominent candidates.
The Grand Lodge of the Degree of i.on
or will also meet to-day In the same build
ing and be in session two days. To-night
the Past Masters' Association will hold a
meeting for the entertainment of such
representatives as may wish to attend,
and there will be in the Grand Lodge a
competition by five teams from that num
ber of lodges for a prize of $100 for excel
lence in the ritualistic and floor work in
the initiatory degrees.

The Much Libeled City of Columbia
to Go Into the Hongkong-Hon
olulu Trade â Night Boats
for Sausallto.
Two of the smartest steam launches
ever built in California were tried out
over the measured mile last Saturday.
They are the Karluk and Collis of the
Alaska Packers' Association's fleet, and
under full steam pressure made 12 4-10
knots an hour with the tide and 8^ knots
against it. The steamers are not built for
Fhow, but for hard service, and every
thing used in their construction was the
best that money could buy. As a result
the association has two of the finest boats
of their size on the Pacific Coast.
The Collis is 50 feet long, 12 feet beam
and 5 feet deep, while the Karluk is four
feet shorter, but has the same beam and
depth of hold as the Collis. The engines
were designed by W. P. Lindley, the
supervising marine engineer of the Alaska
Packers' Association, and they are beau
ties. The cylinders are 6^-inch and 13Vi
inch, with a 10-inch stroke, while the
boilers carry a working pressure of 150
pounds, giving the engines 216 revolutions
a minute. The speed test was from Mis
sion Rock to Hunters Point, and the two
boats fairly flew over the course. Both
in the run down to the point and back to
the rock the Collis had a little the better
of the argument, but not enough to boast
of.
The Karluk and Collis are for use at the
canneries. The former will be shipped on
the ship Santa Clara to Kodiak and the
latter on the ship Bohemia to Nugashak.
There they will be used as tenders during
the season and will come back to San
Francisco with the fleet. The Packers'
Association has spent over $150,uw on its
fleet, this year, and a better found or
better equipped lot of vessels has never
left this port. â .
There was a gathering of the Harbor
Commissioners and their employes at
Fishermen's wharf yesterday morning.
About ten years ago a cluster of four
steel-clad piles were driven at this spot,
and the visit was for the purpose uf see
ing what the teredo had been doing with
the wood during its long immersion.
There were present Commissioners KU
burn Harney and Herold, Chief Engineer
Holmes and Assistant Engineer Kyan,
Superintendent of Urgent Repairs Long
and Assistant Superintendent Jenks and a
pile-pulling crew.
The first armorclad pile that was pulled
was in fair shape. The action of the
water had worn away the steel covering
in places, but the teredo had not gained
an entrance and the wood was as sound
as on the day the pile was driven. Com
missioner Harney used an ax with great
deftness, but the pile nowhere showed
signs of decay. The second pile inspected
did not show up as well. The action of
the water had worn the steel away in
patches and the teredo had done its dead
ly work. The others appeared to be in
fair condition.
It cost $1 a foot to put the steel cover
ing over the piles and the Commissioners
think that the life of the steel does not
warrant any more piles being treated in
that manner. In other words, the life ot
a pile encased in steel is just the length
of time the metal will withstand the cor
rodir.tr Influences of the water. If the
covering costs a dollar a foot to put on
and then only lasts ten years the pile is
a financial failure. so says Commissioner
Kill. urn.

She was to be fitted with yards and sailed
as far as the Chinese coast. Then steam

Hongkong in that way. In the Britsh

PRESENT A SWORD TO EVANS.
lowa's Sailors Testify Their Love for
Their Former Commander.
The crew of the battleship lowa has pre
sented Captain "Bob" Evans with a
sword. It was a specimen of artistic
beauty and as handsome an article as the
boys could obtain. One side of the long
steel blade bore the inscription, "Present
ed to Captain Robley D. Evans. U. S. N.,
by the Crew of the U. S. S. lowa," and
on the reverse side was inscribed, "To
our hero â too just to take a fallen foe'sâ
we give this sword instead." The last in
scription has reference to Captain Evans'
action when he refused to receive the
sword proffered by the vanquished cap
tain of the Viscaya after she had been
run ashore and fired.
Following is the letter which accom
panied the sword that was forwarded to
Captain Evans at Washington last month
and the ajiswer received:
U. S. S. lowa, First Rate
PAX FRANCISCO, Cal.. Feb. 14, 1899
Captain Robley D. Evans, U. S. X., Wash
ington, D. C. â Sir: The members of this shlj.s
company, who had the high honor of cervine
you from San Juan to Santiago, beg leave to
present this sword as a toktn of their affec
tion and reverence.
It had been our intention to make th!s pre
sentation â when you relinquished command but
owing to the disintegration o x Uie orew fol
lowing our arrival at New York In August last,
and our hurried departure, It was not done.
Coming at this late day, It will show you, sir.
that this action Is not from momentary im
pulse but that the affections and respect of
this crew for you is deep-rooted and lasttne
and that the men of the battleship lowa will
ever cherish the memory of their beloved com
mander. . .
with this sword we Bend our wishes for
your health and happiness always. It is an
assurarce from us that you are more than a
hero to a natlon-you are _t r h - e^ o r ,V;,^rTT?F "'
Very respectfully, THE COMMITTEE.
Captain Evans acknowledged the token
j in the following lt-tter:
I Navy Department, Board of Inspection and
Survey, Washington. March Â», li-M.-My Old
Shipmates: Your letter of February 14, with
the handsome swor.l. came to me this morning
as a perfect surprise. That I had the respect
and confidence of the brave crew of the lowa
I felt assured. Tour conduct in action proved
that. But the feeling of personal affection you
have exhibited touches me deeply.
Accept from me. every one of the old gang,
my sincere thanks. Gcd bless you each and
every one and give you long life in defense of
our country. Your faithful friend.

COURTED DEATH TO
PREVENT A MURDER
N. J. EDMTNSTER'S ATTEMPT TO
END HIS LIFE.
Feared Ke Would Kill His Sister If
He Livedâ He Was Crazed From
Opium and Will Try Again.
N. J. Edminster tried to commit suicide
from the fisherman's wharf last evening,
but was fished out of the water by Frank
McCarthy and two others who saw htm
go overboard.
Edminster had been speaking to Mc-
Carthy a few minutes before, and, after
borrowing a cigarette, had told him a
story of a misused life. Edminster said
he was a slave to the opium habit and that
the drug had finally got the better of him.
He had stolen from his people
to get money to buy the stuff
and had borrowed from his relatives
: and friends until they and he could
! stand it no longer. He said his sister
' had been trying to have him arrested.
! He feared he might murder her, and he
I was going to end the whole matter by
1 committing suicide. He had a rope and
! a stone and he declared he was going to
j hitch the rope to himself and jump into
i the water. He said his folks lived in the
Mission and had a comfortable home.
.' Edminster was the name he gave to Mc
l Carthy. /
McCarthy did not believe all the story,
| but spoke to the man in a way to cheer
him up. Then he left him and it was not
many minutes before he heard a cry, and
looking back, he saw Edminster spring
: ing from the wharf with the stone tied
| to him.
McCarthy and two other men who were
' standing near ran to the end of the
i wharf and saw Edminster floating. They
I pulled him out and found the stone had
! slipped out of the loop he had tied in
â  the rope and for that reason he had not
! remained on the bottom.
Edminster objected strongly to being
i rescued and declared he had a pistol and
I that he would make another attempt,
and this time a successful one, before
morning. He was a strong, healthy-look
ing man and apparently well able to care
i for himself. He told McCarthy he would
| surely kill his sister if he did not kill
himself. He said he acquired the opium
habit when he was 15 years old. at which
time . he was confined in the Whittier
reformatory. He said, too, he had an
appointment to meet his uncle and his
brother at half past 8 last night.
McCarthy tried to get the man to go
home or at least to some place where
he could be taken care of, but he flour-
I ished his revolver and - threatened to
i shoot any one who tried to detain him
i or to follow him when he started to go
', away. Persuasion was useless and there
was no use to use force, as the man was
i evidently fully prepared to carry out his
threat, so the three men watched him
go away.

But the strange feature of this equally
strange proceeding was the fact that the

Adolph Spreckels. When the last race
was over a demand was made on the offi

After a wait of ten minutes the request

whole thing a glossy look, the members of
the press wen- informed that Thorpe had
been set down for the balance of the
vc-ekâ except lor his own stable.
This was the only live factor of the
â whole proceedings. Outsiders in the bet
ting had a great inning. Myth 8 to 1, Ping
15 to 1, and Headwater at 25 to 1 being
among the winners. Bullman had a great
following. The promising rider was twice
past the wir* astride winners, and on
four occasions finished second.
After an enforced vacation of many
weeks for acrobatic running, Frank Kit-
man's p'lding Myth made his reappear

made a runaway race of it. His [.arty got
as good as S to 1 in the ring, and it
proved a romp for the chestnut horse. The
favorite. Opponent, did not seem to be
particularly afflicted with speed, but by
nint of hard riding Bullman landed him
in the place.
Another favorite went down in the mile
and a furlong run. Corrigan's Cabrillo
ruled a subdued sort of favorite, but when
the barrier was released Powell shot to
the front with the 12 to 1 shot Ping, and
was never hfaded. Ridden out, the first
.choice disposed of Prince Blazes for the
middle section of the money.
â¢ The Corrigan filly Basseda had a strong
.call in the betting on the four furlong
ramble for two-year-olds, and won with
apparent ease from Mountebank at the
wire in :48%. Florentla was third.
Ailyar was a pronounced favorite for
the six furlong sprint, fourth to be de
cided, managing. however. to show
little speed. Jones on Headwater made a
runaway race of It. beating Horton out by
three lengths.
â¢ The final mile dash went to Los Me

6tcond. .Bullman piloted the winner.

Abe Schwartz Arrested.
Abe Schwartz, son of Henry Schwartz,
the bookmaker, was arrested at Emery
ville track yesterday and taken to the
Oakland City Prison on a warrant charg
ing him with grand larceny. The name
was erroneously reported previously as
Leo Schwartz through the error of a
track officer. He was later released on
$1001 cash ball.
Schwartz is the young man who, it Is
claimed, snatched a handful of currency
from the cash box of Bookmaker Johnny
("oleman during the progress of the races
on Saturday last. He disclaims all knowl
edge of the affair. It is understood
though, that George Suydam. cashier of
the book, is positive that Schwartz took
the coin.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1899.
NO MORE MONEY
FOR AGED AND
INFIRM FIREMEN
Pension Fund Law Is
Unconstitutional.
SUPREME COURT SO DECLARES
THE AUDITOR WILL NOT PAY
DEMANDS.
Acting on the Advice of His Attor
ney â Deserving Pensioners Now
Face a Serious
Problem.
The money in the pension fund of the
Exempt Firemen's Association is no
longer at the disposal of the members of
that organization. As a consequence
seventy-four aged, infirm or disabled fire
men, who have heretofore looked to the
city for support through the pension fund
provided for that purpose, are confronted
with the most serious problem in life.
Many of them must either become
charges on their relatives or friends, be
come inmates of the Almshouse or starve
to death.
This serious condition of affairs was
made known to them on Saturday, when
Auditor "Wells, acting on the advice of his
attorney, refused to audit their monthly
demands on the treasury. These demands
aggregate $1000 and are for sums ranging
from $10 to $25.
For many years the city has paid an ag
gregate of $12,000 a year in pensions to
members of the Exempt Firemen's As-
Boclatlon, such payment being authorized
by an act of the legislature of 1*95, which
aci repealed a similar act passed by the
Legislature in 1889. By the provisions of
the existing law the city Is empowered to
set aside $12,000 annually for the payment
of pensions to aged, infirm or disabled
firemen. This has been religiously done
during past years and the tlreme'n who
were deemed worthy of pensions by the
Exempt Firemen's Association have, on
the first day of each succeeding month,
received a total sum of $10<)0. Now the
Supreme Court comes forward with a de
cision, rendered on the fourth of last
month, in which it is held that the law
authorizing the appropriation of this
money is unconstitutional and therefore
without effect. Acting on this decision
Auditor Wells has refused to audit the de
mands for March of the seventy-four fire
in. ii on the pension rolls of the associa
tion.
The Supreme Court decision that has
caused all of tne trouble was rendered in
the case of George Taylor against thf city
of Oakland. The suit was one in which
the plaintiff sued to compel the munici
pality to pay his pension under the law
authorizing the creation by municipalities
of a firemen's pension fund. The court
held that the statute of 1595 was in con
flict with sections 31 and 32 of article IV
of tne constitution of the State of Califor
nia, which prohibits the Legislature from
making or authorizing the gift of any
public moneys, State >>r municipal, to any
person, association or corporation. The
court says:
A comparison of the act In question with
an act passed for a similar purpose by th-
Legislature of 1889 will direct the attention
at once tv the want of consideration for the
gift contemplated by the act of 1R95. This
act of ISS9 provides that no person shall
share In the funds of the municipality un
less he shall serve in the Fire Department
of that particular municipality for fifteen
years or shall have received injury in the
actual discharge of fire fluty therein. No
such condition or restriction as this Is to be
found in tho act of IW>. but. on the con
trary, all exempt firemen by becoming resi
dents and being enrolled must bo permitted
to participate in the funds of the munici
pality when they become disabled, whether
they have ever performed any service in
such municipality or not. This constitutes
a grift and makes the statute subject to the
objections already pointed out and which
have already been laid down by the Su
preme Court.
The decision affects San Francisco
equally with every other municipality in
the State. Believing this to be so. Au
ditor Wells submitted the matter to his
attorney and was informed that he (the
Auditor) would be exceeding his authority
if he continued to authorize the payment
of money appropriated under an act that
had been declared by the Supreme Court
to be unconstitutional. When the pension
demands were presented on the Ist of the
present month the Auditor therefore gave
notice of his intention to withhold his
signature.
The last Legislature passed a bill
which, had it become a law. would have
rectified the mistakes of the present stat
ute, but Governor Gage In his wisdom saw
fit to give it a socket veto. As the case
now stands a great number of deserving
pensioners in this and other cities in the
State are left without the means that an
appreciative public has provided for their
relief and support.
"I see no way in which the situation can
be remedied." "said Auditor w ells yester
day, "until the next session of the Legis
lature."
GREEN AND SMITH
READY FOR BATTLE
HEAVY WELTER-WEIGHTS ARE
IN FINE FORM.
The Western Club Expects a Large
Crowd to See the Fight Between
Tracey and Neill.
The boxing Instructor of the Olympic
Club, Professor Van Court, Is authority
for the statement that George Green, v,-ho
is matched to fight Billy (Mysterious)
Smith on Friday night, is now in better
condition to enter a hard fistic contest
than he has been for three years to his
knowledge.
This will be cheering news to pome of
the friends of Green, who were of the
opinion that the local welter-weight had
already seen his best days as a pugilist
and that his chances of success against j
si. oh a hard puncher as Smith were only!
slight. Green has been training since
the match was consummated near the
Cliff House and at the Olympic flub. He
expects to enter the ring at the limit
weight, which is 154 pounds; doubtless
his opponent. Smith, will tight at 152
pounds, which weight, h>- contends, will
land him in the ring feeling strong and
able to go any distance.
Smith, who is training in "Alameda, is
very confident of success. A friend of
Green said yesterday that, had it not
been for the excessive heat which pre
vailed on the evening he was defeated by
Smith in New York, the Mysterious man
would certainly have taken the loser's
end of the purse. Green could not stand
the fearful heat of the July night and be
came almost exhausted after battling for
fifteen rounds. The local man must,
however, show considerable improvement
in his gait on Friday evening to satisfy
the sports of this city that he has not
retrograded since he received that whip
ping from black Walcott.
Manager Long of the Western Athletic
Club is exc> i dingly well pleased with the
match he has arranged to take place in
Woodwards Pavilion on the evening of.
the 2iith inst. Tom Tracey is one of the '
most shifty lads in the fighting line, and i
during his years of hard experience in
fighting all kinds of men he has gained
a fund of knowledge which makes him
a master of the game of hit and miss.
N'eill is a strong and game fellow who !
will take heavy punishment. He is not j
as shifty or as cunning as Tracey, but
his friends are very confident that he can j
whip the Australian by employing ag
gressive tactics. The COntdSt will, how
ever, prove what Xelll Is capable of do
ing when he comes into contact with
such a ringster as Tracey, who. by thf>
way. has promised the managers of the
Western riub that h.' will not resort to
running and dodging tactics on this oc
casion.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
give Its monthly exhibition this evening.
E. ('nine will box six rounds with C.
Vickers. "Kid" Johnson will box six
rounds with J. Bell. "Kid " Hogan will
meet Art Granfleld in a six-round bout.
W. Condon is bonked to meet C. Thurs
ton. and John Dean, a clever lightweight
of the club, will contest six rounds with
George Haker of Bait Lake, who is here
looking for snaps.
SPORT FOR THE LADIES.
The Olympic Club Will Give an En-
joyable Entertainment This
Evening.
The Olympic Club will give a very pleas
ant entertainment this evening to its
members and their lady friends. It -will
be known as ladies' night and the pro
gramme of exercises consists of novelty
indoor athletics, such as potato races in
the swimming tank and Indoor baseball,

A. G. Platt. special Assessor appointed
by the Board of Supervisors, called upon
Customs Collector Jackson yesterday
morning and requested the Collector to
Inform him as to the total value of the
merchandise now in the United States
bonded warehouses in this city.
The Collector declined to give the infor
mation. His declination was based upon
the rule of the department enforcing se-Â»
crecy in such matters, and also upon the
fact that merchandise In bonded ware
houses is not the property of the Import
ers, for It ma>\ be condemned and confis
cated or destroyed or ordered shipped out
of the country for many reasons.

FLORENCE IS
DECLARED THE
SOLE HEIRESS
Gypsy Blythes'Claims
Are Dismissed.
SHE GETS FIVE MILLIONS
VERDICT FROM SUPREME COURT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
Final Decision Has Been Rendered
in the Long and Bitter Litiga
tion Over the Big
Estate.
The highest tribunal in the land, the Su
preme Court of the United States, has
given its final decision in the Blythe liti
gation, and it seems that Florence Blythe
Hinckley is at last secure in the posses
sion of the fortune left by Thomas H.
Blythe precisely sixteen years ago, for
his death took place, on April 4, 1883.
The decision was in the suit of John \V.
Blythe and Henry T. Blythe, known as
â â¢tin- Kentucky" or "Qypsy" Blythes.
against Florence Blythe Hinckley, and. as
reported in a telegram received by the
defendant yesterday afternoon from
Washington, P. â¢'-, recites that "the
Blythe appeal has been dismissed on the
authority of the cases formerly cited.
Chief Justice Fuller to-day delivered an
opinion holding that the decisions of the
State court disposed of the constitutional
and treaty questions and of the objec
tions respecting section IH7S of the United
Btatee revised statutes." This decision
was tjiven on motion of Attorneys John
Qarber and Robert Y. Haynes to dismiss
or affirm a summary process that waives
argument in court and, disregarding the
court calendar, brines the case up for de
cision on "law and motion day"â the first
Monday in the monthâ thus saving many
weary months of litigation.
The property left by Thomas H. Blythe
at his demise In lss.'i was estimated to be
worth $6,000,000. It consisted chiefly of
San Francisco real estate, including the
famous Blyihe block on Market and
Geary streets and Grant avenue, and it
produced a revenue of more than $15,000
a month, and this is the fortune of which
Mrs. Florence Blythe Hinckley becomes
possessed through the decision of the
United States Supreme Court. The at
torneys' fees .in the litigation have been
heavy, but the income of the estate has.
it is said, been sufficient to defray them.
Blythe died a bachelor, but there were
several lurid episodes in his career on
which colorable claim was made to a
share in his estate. When the litigation
over the property he had accumulated
was fairly under way, there were no less
than thirty-one claimants to portions of
it the chief claimants being Alice Edith
Blythe. who set up a claim as the mil
lionaire's widow, and Florence Blythe,
now the widow of Frederick W.. or
"Fritz." Hinckley. Alice Edith's claim
went glimmering under the sledge-ham
mer blows of the many attorneys who
took part In the litigation, and Florence's
attorneys downed one opponent after an
other until by this last decision her
claims stand incontrovertible. She is
the daughter of a woman whom Blythe
met in London while she was still un
married, and the courts have held that
he recognized Florence as his daughter.
She came to this country on Blythe's
death, when she was but 10 years of age.
and, shortly after attaining her majoriiv,
became the bride of "Fritz" Hinckley,
son of the well known foundry man. Mr.
Hinckley died of pneumonia a year or so
I ago.
The "Kentucky," or "Gypsy," Blythes'
claim was based on the supposition that
Thomas H. Blythe died without issue and
that inheritance therefore vested, through
I common ancestry, in John W. and Henry
'T. Blythe of Kentucky. They maintained
, that Thomas H. Blythe was of Gypsy
I ancestry, though he ignored that fact on
! coming to this country, and that his near
est kin are the descendants of a Gypsy
i Blythe who settled In Kentucky many
! years ago. Their latest contention has
j been that an alien of British birth can
not Inherit, there being no treaty to that
effect with Greal Britain, and that Flor
ence Blythe being an alien at the time of
Thomas Blythe's death and for more than
the statutory limitation of rive > ears |
I thereafter, could net legally claim the i
dead millionaire's fortune. The words of
the telegram, "holding that the decision
of the State court disposed of the con
stitutional and treaty question," would
seem to settle this matter "once and for
i all.
But Attorney Edmund Burke Holladay,
who has the Interests of the "Kentucky"
Blythes in charge, refuses as yet to be
lieve that the new decision is all-compre
hensive. "Wait until we see the full text
of the decision." he said last night, "and
then we shall know."

comer was notified that a story was ex
pected of him. There seemed to he an im
pression that the gentleman was not pre
pared, but h<~ was. In fact he had a good
one, especially as it was fresh and could
be verified by a number of gentlemen
well known in legal and commercial cir
cles.
Mr. Fortmnn was one of a party of four
hunters who left this city last Saturday
evening and reached their destination sev
eral hours later. The place was Grand
Prairie, twelve miles from Elmira. The
party consisted of Justin F. YV. Henshaw
of the Supreme bench, W. <; Henshaw of
the rnion Bank of Oakland, Judge E.
Nusbaumer of Oakland, and Mr. Portman.
The hunters were prepared to slay the
geese that are at present destroying the
growing grain of the farmers of" that lo
cality, and from all accounts they had all
the fun they desired. They stayed over
night with Doc Stewart and Abe Krumo
and under the guidance of their hosts
found themselves In the pits or blinds in
the great expanse of valley at an early
hour the next mornine. Judge Henshaw.
Mr. Fort man and Abe Krumh occupied
three of the pits, and ahotit a mile away
W. G. Henshaw. Judge Xusbaumer and
Doc Stewart hid themselves in similar
places. Surrounding the pits were a lot
of live and dead decoys to attract the
birds, hut better than the decoys were the
goose calls of Stewart and Krumb.
As soon as it was lipht the geese began
to fly, and such a varietyâ Ross gpesp,
snow geese, Mexican, grey, cackling
Hutchlns, grey brant and <<th<rs. They
came in bunches, flocks and swarms and
right merrily did the humors kfep up a
shower of Xn. fi shot upon the flying hirds.
When the time came for the hunters to
start for the train a count-tip showed that
Mr. Fortman and Judge Henshaw had
bagged W geese of various kinds. While
Judge Nusbaumer and W. G. Henshaw
had tumbled over lfiri geese. At last ac
counts their hosts were still picking up
birds that had "died out of hounds." and
had increased the lot by about fifty.
"I tell you It was great sport," remarked
Mr. Fortman.

COMPETITION IN LIGHTING.
AT the meeting of the Supervisors' Street Com
mittee on Thursday it was decided in the near
future tc discuss a plan for fostering competi
tion in lightiog the streets, public buildings, stores and
residences of the city. Dr. Perrault introduced a reso
lution at a meeting of the board a few weeks ago
which provides for placing all competitive companies
upon a : equality. It grants every lighting
the privilege of erecting poles outside
the fire limits and .enacts that all wires within the
fire limits shall be placed underground forthwith.
The Street Committee decided to request representa
i the Merchants' Association to meet it in joint
conference for a discussion of the subject, and such
a meeting will be held to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock.
It may not be generally known, but it is a fact
nevertheless that no franchise is necessary for the
construction and operation in this city of lighting
The constitution lays down the process in
unmistakable terms. Section 19 of article XI reads
as foil
In any city where there are no public works
owned and controlled by the municipality for sup
plying the same with water or artificial light any
individual or any company, duly incorporated for
fuch purpose under and by authority of the laws
of this State, shall, under th* direction of the Super
'ntendent of Streets, or other officer in control there
,nd under such general regulations as the mu
may jnvscribe for damages and Indem
nity for damages, have the privilege of using the
public streets and thoroughfares thereof, and of lay-
Ing down pipes and conduits therein and connections
therewith. s<> far as may be necessary for introduc
ing into and supplying such city and its inhabitants
âº ither with gaslight or other illuminating light, or
with fresh water for domestic and all other pur
3, upon the condition that the municipal govern
ment shall have the right to regulate the charges
thereof.
Supervisor Perrault's resolution is the general reg
ulation which the sbove section declares shall be
prescribed by the municipal authorities. But whether
it is necessary or not is an open question. Judge
Seawell has decided that under this provision of the
organic law no restriction can be placed upon com
petitive lighting companies by the Supervisors. Un
doubtedly if the board should fail to prescribe the
regulations referred to competing concerns could go
on and prescribe them for themselves. No Board
cf Supervisors or Common Council would have the
power to defeat competition in lighting by failing
to act.
These things are interesting in view of the recent
â  organization in this city of an independent electric
light company. That concern will have no*-difficulty
whatever in introducing a competitive plant. We
doubt whether, under a fair construction of section
19, the Board of Supervisors could forbid the erec
tion of poles so long as poles are used for any electric
wires, telegraph or telephone. The purpose of the
constitution is to reduce lighting to a competitive
basis, and we do not believe that process can be pre
vented by stifling competition as has been done here
tofore.
Some of the soldiers who were brought back from
Honolulu to be discharged and are still here make
what appears to be a reasonable complaint. They
say they were denied travel pay on the ground that
Honolulu is in foreign territory, and are denied the
..extra pay allowed for service in foreign territory
on the ground that Honolulu is as thoroughly do
mestic as Milpitas. Uncle Sam ought not to set up
a surething game like this.
Â«
It. was hardly necessary for a Coroner to hold an
inquest over a man at Antioch who had died after liv
ing ninety-three years. The suspicion of old age was
so well founded that it required no official confirma
tion.
Easter Sunday in many parts of the East was
marked by a blizzard of more than ordinary severity,
and the bonnet of the day will have to go over for a
month and make its debut at the May day picnics.
Vanderbilt has a right to give his son $10,000,000,
of course, but there are many worthy American
fathers who decline to bestow such wedding gifts,
and yet the young people get along all right.
South Dakota can be proud of its soldiers living
and its soldiers dead. No finer body of men went
through this city on the way to war, and none more
valiantly ever met the foe.
Los Angeles has something the matter with its
musical car. Not even for the sake of boosting art
by the display of good clothes would it attend the
opera.
There is no doubt of the right of William Waldorf,
Astor to be a citizen of England if he desires, and if
there is to be objection let it come from the other

with his retinue of ten servants, and has instantly
assumed a tone of arrogance that no conqueror of
ancient times or Oriental despot of the' present cen
tury could have excelled. He stigmatizes the people
of the State who resisted and defeated his proposal
to fund the Central Pacific debt for a hundred years,
at the rate of 2 per cent per annum, as "turbulent,"
and defiantly announces in relation to the debt itself
that "it is from the patrons of the road, largely Cali
fornians, that the money must come, as the road has
no other means of earning it." The fact was antici
pated, but not that it would be presented in the form
of an edict or a ukase.
The funding bill, as originally proposed, was
beaten not by a small faction, but by the almost
unanimous action of the people of California. There
was a strong desire, which still exists, for peace and
co-operation with the railroad, if consistent with the
preservation of our liberty and our independence,
and but for the treacheries of the last campaign and
of the closed legislative session an era of harmony
might have been already inaugurated. There is still,
as there has always been among citizens who repre
sent industry, enterprise and capital, no inclination
to prolong the strife that unquestionably does play
into the hands of demagogues. But the dogmatism
and the dictatorial expressions of Mr. Huntington
appear to indicate that he no longer recognizes the
right of the inhabitants of California even to call their
souls their own.
It is a pity that this venerable railroad capitalist,
who has impressed his individuality upon every en
terprise with which he is connected, should abso
lutely fail in ordinary respect for his fellow citizens
and should seriously regard himself as the Czar of
California, if not of the Union. It may be true that
the patrons of the Central Pacific will have to pay
its debt, but it is also true that the collateral proper
ties and the private fortunes that the railroad people
have extracted from the toil and sweat of our citizens,
and that, too, by diversions of revenue and appro
priations of capital and income that would not be
sanctioned in any honest court of equity, would
cover at least six or eight times its amount. It is
barely possible, though not probable, that this coun
try may drift into imperialism, and that Mr. Hunt
ington and those who act with him may acquire in
law the position they now usurp in fact. But unless
this deplorable transformation of our institutions oc
curs the time is near at hand when effective ways and
means of resisting railroad exactions and railroad
tyranny will be devised. The successors of Mr.
Huntington at least are likely to pay some attention
to the voices of American communities.
THE SYNDICATE MfINIA.
WHILE the press, the statesmen of the country
and, to a large extent, the general public
have been more clamorous and more em
phatic than ever in denouncing trusts and condemn
ing their operations, the creation of such combina
tions has been carried forward to an extent unparal
leled in any other age or in any other land. The en
terprises of Hooley and other promoters in Great
Britain are insignificant in comparison with what has
been accomplished here.
The center of activity in the movement has been
of course in New York, but most of the combina
tions have been organized under the lax laws of
New Jersey and are nominally corporations of that
State. It is stated that in 1898 the companies author
ized there and in West Virginia aggregated a capi
talization of only a little less than one thousand mil
lions of dollars; and the Philadelphia Manufacturer
says the indications are that this year the New Jersey
authorities will authorize corporations or syndicates
whose shares will at par value aggregate six times
that enormous sum.
In fact, the organization nf syndicates, or trusts, to
control the manufacturing industries of the country
has become a mania among Eastern capitalists, and
many of the more conservative journals of that sec
tion of the country believe it has been carried too
far. The fear is that the shares of many of these
great combinations have been sold at speculative
prices owing to the large amount of idle money in
the financial centers, and that sooner or later there
will come a collapse which will be injurious not only
to the speculators but to the country at large.
From a compilation of the opinions of the financial
and industrial press on the subject recently made by
the Literary Digest it appears there has been no
lack of words of warning to the public. The Finan
cial Chronicle is quoted as noting that in January
and February of this year there were definitely
formed new combinations having an aggregate capi
tal of $1,106,300,000, and saying: "When the end
will come no man knows definitely, but that it will
come everybody of any foresight realizes perfectly
well. He knows, too. what the end will be when it
does come, and whoever can take in his sail during
the next few months will be a Vise mariner."
Bradstreet stated several weeks ago: "It would
seem that in a good many cases' the common stocks
represent more or less water. For the time being,
however, the financial public seems to be infatuated
with the movement, and though even a cursory ex
amination of the situation does not fail to develop
the fact that it possesses elements of weakness, there
is nothing to negative the presumption that, like
everything of the kind, it must run its course."
It is to be regretted that this mania for speculation
in syndicate stocks has broken out among the capi
talists of the East just at a time when the country has
every natural prospect of an era of unexampled pros
perity. If the men of the East would use their sur
plus capital in exploiting and developing the vast
rich regions of the West and South they would confer
an immense benefit upon the country and reap a rich
profit for themselves. Moreover their ventures, if
made with ordinary sagacity, would be safe from
risks of disaster. There would be none of that dan
ger which thoughtful men now see impending over
Wall street and its speculators.
Fortunately, the appetite for battle news, whetted
by the Philippine campaign, does not suffer from
famine during the lull in Asia. The Chicago cam
paign keeps up the supply of gory news, with a
larger percentage of fatalities than in the Philippines.
The Carter Harrison faction is doing most of the
benevolent assimilation.
There are disadvantages attached to fame. Corbett
and his wife cannot have a quiet little family row
without news of. it being flashed across the continent.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1899.
THE LAW AND THE GAMBLERS.
WHEN the Supervisors in response to the de
mand of the public enacted the ordinance for- ,
bidding gambling at Ingleside, the track man
agers, the poolsellers and their touts were loud in
their boasting of a pull with the courts that would j
enable them to defy the law. They are less boastful j
now. Their pull has been found wanting. The !
courts have upheld the law.
The opinion delivered by Judge Murasky in dis
solving the injunction issued to restrain the police â 
from entering the racetrack, and which was pub- j
hshed in The Call on Sunday, merits more than a
passing notice. It is a clear exposition of the law
governing the point in controversy and emphatically
upholds the right of the police to enter the grounds
of the racecourse and arrest law-breakers who may j
be found there.
After pointing out that the plaintiffs in the case
(the gamblers) assert .their innocence and allege that i
the action of the defendants (the police) is damag
ing to their business: while the defendants allege that
the plaintiffs are wrongdoers and violators of the law,
Judge Murasky said:
Where greater injury will be inflicted upon plaint
iff than upon the defendant by the dissolution of an
injunction pendente lite, the injunction should be
maintained until the final hearing. Where the con
trary result will occur the injunction should be dis- !
solved. If the plaintiff's allegations are true it will
suffer much loss, unless defendants are restrained,
and defendants will suffer none by the injunction.
If, however, the allegation of defendants is true, that i
plaintiff is a law-breaker, then the injury to the !
municipality from the continuance of the injunction ;
would be greater than any that can be compensated â 
by money, and tVierefore greater than^ any the
plaintiff can suffer.
That statement of the law is in accord with reason
and justice. The injury that may be done to the
gamblers by the police is as nothing in comparison
with the wrong done to the community by the pool- j
sellers. As the Judge well said, the latter injury ;
would be "greater than any that can be compen
sated by money." The injunction therefore was dis
solved.
Commenting upon the decision, Attorney McEner- j
ney is quoted as saying he believed the decision of i
Judge Murasky ended the controversy. As the right
of the club to seek relief in a court of equity rested J
solely, according to the opinion of the court, upon a
question of fact, which was easily established in favor
of the police, there is no escape for the club under
the anti-pool ordinance, and it must either refrain
from further selling or suffer the consequences.
There can be little or no doubt that this opinion |
will prove correct. Racing, poolselling and track
gambling of the kind that have been so pernicious
at Ingleside have been driven from the great chic?
of the East, and it is not to be supposed that Cali- I
fornia law is less effective than that of her sister
States.
RELAXING EXCLUSION.
IT is reported that communication between the Chi
nese Minister at Washington and the Chinese
Consul at Honolulu is to the effect that a new
trentj- with China is made necessary' by our appear
ance in Hawaii and the Philippines, and that therein
the strict exclusion features of our present treaty will
be softened and relaxed. During the discussion of
Hawaiian annexation The Call declared that this
policy would be inevitable if we acquired tropical
possessions with the expectation of getting commer
cial value out of them. White men cannot work in
the plantations of Hawaii! The climate bars them
out. Without coolie labor there, the production of
the islands will decline to the zero where it stood
when reciprocity made sugar of sufficient value to
warrant the importation of Asiatic coolie labor.
When annexation occurred it was given out that our
Chinese exclusion laws would be extended and our
non-contract and other labor laws would speedily
follow, so that equality in the kind and cost of labor
would exist between the islands and the continent.
It is evident that this policy collides with the com
mercial expectations which induced annexation, and
that it is withdrawn and the planters are to have lib
eral treatment in respect to their labor supply, so as
to avoid that lack of laborers which would first cause
a substantial increase in wages, to the lowering of
1 rofits, and finally the disappearance of a consequen
tial surplus of production.
Our practical homogeneity of climate and physical
conditions has heretofore simplified the problem of
labor and wage?. There has been a fair equality of
hours, rights and wages in all parts of the United
States. As we enter the tropics this condition ceases.
Our people demand commercial advantages to offset
the cost of conquest and government. Commerce
cannot be without the surplus productions of labor.
Therefore tropical commerce depends upon that form
of labor suited to the climate, which must be in some i
way servile. Our home labor laws cannot apply to i
servile labor, for with their application its servility !
ceases and without servility its usefulness and profit j
to the employer cease.
These facts give color to the report of a new treaty !
with China, which will be a novelty because it will
continue restriction as to our continental possessions,
but relax it on our newly acquired islands. Therein ;
will first appear the inequality of law required by in
equality of physical conditions, and it will be official
notice served on American labor that it has no place
in the tropics.
Other departures from our domestic system will of
necessity occur in quick succession.
It is evident now that the influence of the Hawai
ian planters put the code of laws for those islands i
to sleep on the files of the last Congress. They de- ;
sire to entrencfh coolie labor in a new Chinese treaty, !
which can be easier ratified by the Senate than a law j
to secure the same end can pass both houses of Con- I
gress.
The victory so far is distinctly with those who j
want -cheap labor. They refuse to submit to equality
of law and wages. In the logical development of the
issue their competition with the products of our do
mestic labor will finally cause its employers to clamor
for equality. As the employers in our tropics hold j
the whip hand and refuse to permit their labor and
wages to be leveled up, will not the final result be
that our domestic labor and wages will be leveled
down ?
In popular government inequality is odious and
finally yields, as slavery did to freedom, which be
came the universal law of the republic. Now there
is a change of ideals. That was an age of senti
ment; this is one of commercialism, and will its spirit
permit a higher level of labor and wages in. the tem
perate than in the torrid zone?
There are reasons for believing the insurrection in
the Philippines has been virtually broken, but now
a new strife appears between the Turks and the Bul
garians, and the war chorus continues to hold the
stage.
Huntington's statement that the Southern Pacific
Company had nothing to do with the Senatorial con
test at Sacramento imposes upon Herrin the duty of
explaining what he was doing there.
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE
ATHERTON INTERVIEW
Some three or four weeks ago an Interview with Gertrude Ather
ton was obtained by the representative of a reputable Eastern syndi
cate and sold to the leading papers of the United States, including The
Call. For some reason, known only to herself, the authoress repudi
ated parts of this interview and said it was garbled and attributed to
her ideas and words which she had never uttered. A venomous little
afternoon paper published in this city gave this repudiation to the pub
lic, piecing it out with sentences that betrayed -Its own spitefulness and
imbecilit -. In due time thi; reflection upon the truthfulness and ac
curacy of his work reached the gentleman who gave the Atherton in
terview to the press. His reply, which is here given, is in many re
spects as interesting as was the interview that caused it to be written:
150 Nassau Street.
NEW YORK. March 29. 1599.
Editor The Call. Ban Francisco. Cal.: In reference to Gertrude Ather
ton's statement, as printed in the paper you sent me. I have to say that her
assertions are not based on facts. Why she selects The Call to discharge
her venom upon, I do not know: for the New York Journal printed the mat
ter, by mistake, on the Thursday previous to its publication in The Call, in
stead of on the same date, and the Philadelphia Press and Chicago Tribune
simultaneously with The Call's publication.
I was in correspondence with Mrs. Atherion subsequent to the publication
of tho interview of which she complains, and she had no criticism whatever
to make regarding it. Her statement that she wired me for a proof of the
interview is made from whole cloth, as the records of the telegraph offices
will show if any one cares to look it up.
I enclose you the second article, which Mrs. Atherton refers to as a "dull
jumble of words." The editor of the Saturday Evening Post of Philadelphia,
who printed it. was kind enough to write me that he considered it the work of
a master hand. I fancy the Post is as good a judge of English ard of in
terest as Mrs. Atherton.
Now. as regards the interview in detail. I had never seen Mrs. Atherton
previous to the meeting in Washington. T must confess that I have read
none of her books. I noticed a statement in a New York paper that she
was making a study of the Tnited States Senate for the purpose of writing
a novel. I wrote her that I would like to talk to her about her observa
tions and several other things. I did not refer to one of. her books, because,
as I say, I have never read nnc. \
I went to the boarding-house where Mrs. Atherton lived in Washington
with the distinct and understood purpose of talking with her for publication
and nothing else. Mrs. Atherton well understood this, because she was kind
enough with her own hands to bring a table to me upon which I might take
notes.
Mrs. Atherton says: "In order to make a spicy article he made me say
things regarding the Senate and members that came straight out of his imag
ination." I am sorry to say that Mrs. Atherton seems to have a very failing
memory in this respect. I should not have made the statements if they had
not been made by her. Had it been my desire to make a spicy article, as she
states. I might have included therein her remarks concernine: her own
marital experiences, her reference to her husband as the late "unlamented,"
and a few other matters of that sort.
In reference to Washington society Mrs. Atherton's strictures as given by
me were exactly what she said. I realized the importance of absolute accu
racy, and made no statement whatever which was not hers verbatim. T
n.ight possibly have included Mrs. Atherton's criticisms of the society she
met in the place in which she lived, or of the callers to whom she denied
herself while I was th^re. but that seemed to me unnecessary -
Referring again to my second article from her. T have to say that about
the only statement she makes which is correct is that I sent a proof to her.
She returned that proof with full permission to me to publish it. and the only
correction she made was in the heading. This proof and the letters which
have passed between Mrs. Atherton and myself on the matter can be pro
duced if necessary, though I must confess I have no inclination to make a
correspondence with a lady public.
In conclusion, the situation seems to me to be this: A question of veracity
between Mr?. Atherton and myself. The greatest point of difference is that I
can prove what I say. while Mrs. Atherton has thus far confined herself to a
tirade against newspapers in general and me in particular.
The fact is that Mrs. Atherton's criticisms of "Washington .society and
of several of the Senators have furnished food for discussion, and that .some
of this discussion has not been as altogether peasant to Mrs. Atherton as it
might have been. The refuge she takes in denial has been sought by others
who have talked for publication and been criticized. Personally, this happens
to be my first experience. It is the first time I ever interviewed a woman. I
am inclined to think I will end the chapter as I. began itâ with Mrs. Atherton.
You are at liberty to publish any or all of this, if you care to, over my
signature. Very truly, CHARLES CULVER JOHNSON.
DAN POLK, SELLS
NAME AND FAME
DAK POLK, banjoist. Bohemian, brother to the only Willis, lineal de
scendant of James K. Polk, one time President of these United States,
and well known in club, society and musical circles of this city, has
sold his name. $
Sold not only his name, but his fame as well.
Together they were knocked down for the unprincely sum of twenty dol
lars (S2O 00).
Think of purchasing a Polk, a pedigreed virtuoso of the fjr=t rank in ban
jodom. for one beggarly, yellow double eagle of the realm: It sounds like a
smoker's vision, and yet it is trueâ sadly, incontestably true.
Dan. the pet plunker of the swim and the vaudeville's pride, has sold out.
And now another long-haired youth of nimble fingers and dreamy eyes
smotes the banjo that Dan used to smite, looks the languishing looks that
Dan used to look, receives the flowers and salary and matinee notes that
once were Dan's, and wears in print and in private the proud name of a
President's descendant.
The once prominent Polk is now probably an ambiguous Smith or an
evasive Jones, lost in the shadow of a new name and the building of a new
reputation. The new Polk who separated himself from a score of honest dol
lars to become the same, is at the Orpheum. Read the programme for your
self. There, in tall, stout type, is emblazoned "Polk and Rollins, Celebrated
Musical Artists."
Polk and Kollins are the names of the famous banjo team founded and
perfected by Daniel. It was known and respected the length and breadth of
the vaudeville world for well-clad, parted-in-the-middle gentility and tri
umphant technique on the five staccato strings of America's national instru
ment.
But Dan. eccentric Bohemian that he is. wearied of the opulent fortunes
of a vaude villain, of a name historic, of a publicity national, and sold them
all out for the price already mentioned to an ambitious pupil of his who
hails 'from Kansas City.
What the purchaser's name used to be nobody seems to knowâ but now
It is Polk and paid fr>r. The same old Polk and Kollins lithographs decorate
the cigar stands and deadwalls of the city, with the hair and features of
Dan still intact. But a new boy. who only partly lives up to the beauty of
the posters, plunks where Dan once plunked and receives Dan's dinner and
boudoir invitations.

Work of Laying Underground Wires
Will Commence in a Short

A. M. Hunt, the well-known electrical
engineer, left this city on the 6 o'clock
train last night for an extended tour In |
the East. Mr. Hunt's mission is one of j
interest to the people of San Francisco, !
and, as San Francisco is the business j
center of the State, incidentally to the |
whole State. Mr. Hunt has been com- j
missioned by the Independent Light and i
Power Company, incorporated March 29 I
by Claus Spreckels and others, to make a
general Inspection of electrical plants
throughout the East. Regarding his jour
ney Mr. Hunt says:
"It will be my mission to investigate
light and power plants everywhere and
select the best methods from each of
them. In this way we can safely promise
that San Francisco will have the finest
plant in the world. The great trouble
with most plants is that they grow from
small beginnings. Wherever such is the
case you will find a piece of antiquated
machinery running side by side with the
newest and most improved. The inevit
able result of this is an 'increase In the
cost of production.
"Take the local plant, for instance. It
started a number of years ago on a small
scale. Of course all machinery it put
in at the time was the most modern, and,
as a matter of fact, all the machinery it
added as the plant grew has been modern,
but all the old. cumbrous machinery must
be taken out and an entire new plant put
in before they will have an up-to-date
plant, as greater strides have been made
in the lines of electrical machinery than
any other.
"The new concern will not start small
and grow. A complete plant of the new
est machinery will be put in, and this
will enable us not only to give better
service than the older companies, but we
will be able to do it cheaper.
"I have not yet made any definite plans
as to what cities I shall visit, but I will
?tnp off at Chicago, then probably go on
to New York, Philadelphia. Boston and
other cities. I will first make a study
gt the underground system of distribu
tion, as we intend laying the wires first
There are several such systems now in
use. chief among which is the Edison
system, where the wires are laid in rigid
ducts and a system of loose ducts. With
the Edison system it is necessary to tear
up the streets to replace wires, "but with
the other system old wires can be taken
out and new ones substituted from regu
lar stations without a pick being placed
In the ground or a paving stone moved
I am somewhat favorable to the latter
system, but I desire to make a comDlete
and thorough investigation.
"As soon as an underground system
has been chosen work will begin We
will employ an army of men tearing ud
the streets and laying wires. Of course
this is the most tedious work and we
expect that by the time the last foot of
wire has been laid the plant will be fully
established and the wheels ready to turn
In fact the people will be surprised to
learn in what a short time a plant can
be estah Ished and put In operation

GRAVE CHARGES
AGAINST THE
GIRLS' HOME
Alleged Cruelties to
Inmates.
DARK CELL AND HANDCUFFS
LAURETTA HALL COMPLAINS TO
THE SHERIFF.
Many Serious Accusations and a
Plea for Release From the Al
leged Chamber of
Horrors.
Sheriff Martin was made the recipient
yesterday of a very serious complaint
against the management of the California
Girls' Training Home at 147 Natoma
street. The complaint, or rather the
charges, were made by one of the inmates
of the home, a young girl named Lauretta
Hall, whose father and mother are now
on trial in the Superior Court on charges
of embezzlement. She is 16 years old, of
good character, and her presence In the
home is due to circumstances connected
with and growing out of the arrest of her
parents and not because of waywardness.
The girl declares that the inmates of
the home are subjected to treatment that
would not be permitted or tolerated in
any penal institution in the State. She
says they are given insufficient and poorly
cooked food; that it is coarse in quality
and so unpalatable as to be nauseating.
She also avers that the inmates, who are
all young girls under 18 years of age. are
not permitted sufficient air and exercise
to keep them healthy.
It was in connection with the punish
ment given those who break the over
strict rules governing the conduct of in
mates of the home that Miss Hall had the
most serious charges to make. For any
slight infraction of the rules of the place
the guilty one is given what is called a
"check." When the girl has six of these
checks against her she is made to eat her
meals standing in the presence of other 3
who are seated at the dining room table.
The meal so eaten consists of plain bread
and water.
According to Mips Hall'? statement a
room, known as the "punishment room."
is set aside for those found guilty of more
serious infractions of the rules. Th":
windows of this room are boarded up,
leaving the interior as dark as it is pos
sible to make a room. There is no bed
in the apartment, those who are thrust
in there having to be content with a soil
ed mattress, which is thrown upon the
fl oor in one corner. Those who are put
in this room are fed on bread and water
and are kept there several days at a
time. Miss Hall says that the more re
fractory wrong-doers are frequently
handcuffed in order to make the dark
room punishment more severe. She cites
one instance in which the unfortunate cil
prlt. a girl named Mabel Morris, remained
handcuffed for three days. When she
was finally released her wrists were badly
swollen and discolored and she was un
able to use her hands for days afterward.
When Miss Hall was sent to the home
about six weeks ago she weighed 131
pounds. She now weigh? 105 pounds, and
declares her belief that she will soon die
unless she is taken away from there and
placed where she can have light and air
and proper food.

Nuisance Must Be Finally De
termined in Another
Action at Law.
- " â â â 
The big turntable at Geary and Mar
ket streets, the property of the Geary
Street, Park and Ocean Railroad Com
pany, will remain where it is, at least
for the present. Judge Bahrs yester
day decided the injunction proceedings
instituted by the railroad company to
restrain Superintendent of Streets Am
brose from proceeding: under an order
of the Board of Supervisors and re
moving the turntable, the chancellor
holding that in the action at bar he
had no power to determine whether or
not the turntable was a nuisance in
fact. In consequence a permanent in
junction was granted, forever restrain
ing the defendants in the action from
removing the turntable by reason of
the direction to that eitect contained in
the resolution passed by the Board of
Supervisors.
The opinion is as follows:
The court in this action, as will be
hereafter shown, has not the power to
determined whether the so-called Geary
etreet turntable is a nuisance and
should therefore be abated. It is per
haps to be lamented that this question
could not have been squarely litigated
between the railroad company and the
people in this action ana a decision
reached which would have been a
finality.
The first question the court in this
E.'ticn is called upon to decide is whether
the Board of Supervisors of the City and
County of San Francisco, by a mere res
olution, can condemn as a nuisance and
* direct the removal of the turntable con
structed and maintained by the plaintiff
tinder, claim of legislative sanction and
franchise.
The Hoard of Supervisors on August 15,
IS9S, passed the following resolution, to
â¢wit: "Resolution No. 1594 (Fourth Se
ries). Resolved, that the turntable at
the junction of Geary and Market streets
be declared a nuisance and that the
Superintendent of Streets be directed to
remove the same in order that the City
Street Improvement Company may per
form its contract. And the Clerk is
hereby directed to advertise this resolu
tion as required by law.

On August IT. ISO>. the Superintendent
of Public Streets â¢â â -â â . the follow
ir.e- communication to the plaintiffs, to
wit:
"New City Hall, August 17, 1898.â J. L.
WUlleutt Ksq.. General Manager Goary
Street, Park and Ocean Railroad Com
pany. Dear -Sir: You are hereby notified
to remove within five (5) days the turn
table, the property of the Geary Street
and Ocean Railroad Company, located at
the intersection of Geary, Kearny and
Market streets, the same having been de
clared a nuisance, as per order Board of
Supervisors August 15. IS9S. If at the ex
piration of five (5) days from the time of
the service of this notice said turntable
is not removed. I will proceed to abate
the nuisance. Yours very respectfully,
"W. F. AMBROSE."
"Superintendent of Public Streets."
On August 22, 1S!>8. this suit was com
menced to restrain such threatened re
moval of the turntable, and the Presid
ing Judge of this court issued a tempor
ary restraining order. The section of the
franchise under which plaintiff claims
the right to maintain the turntable is
V- follows, to wit:
"The track and all switches or turn
tables for said railroad shall be construct
ed under the supervision of and to thÂ«
satisfaction of the Superintendent of
Streets and the Street Committee of the
Board of Supervisors of the City and
County of San Francisco." If the turn
table was authorized by and constructed
pursuant to the provisions of the above
section of plaintiff's franchise, the turn
table has the sanction of the Legislature,
end car not be a nuisance in law. To this
effect is section 34*2 of the Civil Code,
viz. : "Nothing which is done or maintain
ed unuer the express auuiority of -a stat
ute can be deemed a nuisance."
Plaintiff contends that the turntable
was construcini as nr vi<jpn ov Â«=â¢.,' i rraÂ«
chise, with the consent and approval of
the officials designated therein; defend
ants contend that certain ordinances reg
ulating the construction of turntables
were violated, wherefore said turntable
is a nuisance, notwithstanding the ap
proval of the designated officials: plain
tiff denies the violation of these ordi
nances, but contends that they were all
coi.iplied with. â :â  !
The turntable had been, in fact, main
tained for six years before the resolution
rf the Board of Supervisors condemning
the same as a nuisance was passed. It
Is under these circumstances, conditions i
and contentions that the court is called '
upon to decide whether the Board of Su-
T>pr\-!8ors in thus by resolution sum
marily declaring the turntable a nuis

Defendants in their brief contend:

-1 ? Â£ rounds ot said city and county; and '
i LJ? TGV ? n $ or regulate the running at

struction of the same when at large con
trary to ordinances."
The power given by this statute over I
nuisances and obstructions in public
streets, highways, etc.. is by "regula
on ' Regulation is something entirely
distinct from resolution or order. By this
statute some nuisances may evidently be
abated by resolution or order, but the
power to abate them in public streets is
limited to "regulation."
ihe word "regulation" has a well-de
nned meaning in law. Perhaps the best
definition is that to be found in the Amer
ican and English Encyclopedia of Law,
volume 20, page 732:
'â To adjudge by rule, method or estab
lished mode; to direct by rule or restric
tion; to subject to governing principles
or laws." .
A power to "regulate" does not properly
include a power to "suppress" or pro- 1
hibit," for the very essence of regulation
is the existence of something to be regu
lated. But the power to "regulate a
trade, business, etc, authorizes the mu
nicipality to confine the exercise of such
business to certain localities, to certain
hours of the day, etc.
The Board of Supervisors under this
statute has not the power arbitrarily to
say that any man's house is a nuisance
because of Its peculiar construction or its
height, or that certain display signs are
nuisances because they project beyond
the property line to any extent. But the
Board of Supervisors has the power to
regulate within reasonable limits the
height of houses and the extent to which
signs may project, and they have the
right to enforce such regulations. As to
turntables, the same ' rule applies. The
Board of Supervisors clearly has the pow
er to prevent the construction of any
turntables In the future, providing they
.jo so by "regulation": It also has the un
doubted power, notwithstanding such a
regulation, to grant a franchise to lav a
turntable thereby and to that extent re
pealing the regulation. But if such fran
chise IS once given, the board has no
power during the life of the franchise to
retract the privilege.
A regulation means a law to which all
can conform. The resolution complained
of in this suit is clearly not a rule of con
duct, but a declaration of condemnation
concerning a special thing.
Regulations must be laws binding upon
all persons, and the Board of Supervisors
has no power of making regulations ex
cept by ordinance. In City of Denver vs.
Mullen. 7 Col., 345, the court says: "A
provision In the charter of a city confer
ring authority upon the Council" to make
regulations to secure the general health
of the inhabitants, 'to declare what shall
be a nuisance, and to prevent and abate
the same.' will warrant the declaration by
general ordinance of what shall constitute
and the conditions and circumstances un
der which a given thing shall become and
be deemed a nuisance, but does not au
thorize the Council, by mere resolution or
motion, arbitrarily to declare any par
ticular thing a nuisance which has not
theretofore been pronounced to be such
by law. or so adjudged by judicial deter
mination."
In Yates vs. City of Milwaukee. 10
Wall, 497. the Supreme Court of the United
States said: â â¢â¢" - â  ,\
--"But the mere declaration by the city
of Milwaukee that a certain structure was
an encroachment or obstruction did not !
make it so. nor could such declaration I
make it a nuisance unless it in fact had j
that character."
In Spokane Street Railway Company vs. I
Spokane Falls, 6 Wash., 521. the court I
said:
"There was a resolution passed by the
Council, but that resolution was a mere
special direction in this particular case. '
The law contemplates that In all such
cases there shall be a general ordinance i
which shall be a law of the city which it f
is bound to follow as much as the people j
are bound to obey. In an absence of an I
ordinance regulating such matters the j
city should have resorted to lerr proceed
ings and not taken In its own hands by j
force the execution of a decree against I
a party who has no legal notice of the
pendency of the matter."
Decisions to th effect might he multi- '
plied, but no useful purpose would be sub- I
served.
Aside from these general considerations i
that the city cannot ( act by order or reso
lution when its power is limited by
statute to regulation by ordinance, there
are other considerations which of them
selves would be sufficient to stay the con
templated action of the city.
Neither does the power to abate nuis
ances warrant the destruction of valued ,
property which was lawfully erected or I
anything which was erected by lawful I !
authority. It would indeed be a danger- j
ous power to repose in municipal corpora- !
tions to permit them to declare, by ordi
nance or otherwise, anything a nuisance
which the caprice or interests of those
having control of its government might i
see fit to outlaw without being responsible
for all th"c consequences, and, even if such I
power is expressly given by the Legisla
ture, it is utterly' Inoperative and void i
unless the thing Is in fact a nuisance, or
was created or erected after the passage
of the ordinance and in defiance of it.
* â¢ â¢ Therefore, except in cases of great
public emergency, when the emergency
may safely be regarded as so strong as to
justify extraordinary measures upon the
ground of paramount necessity, or when
the use of property complained of is so
clearly a nuisance as to leave no room for'
doubt* upon the subject, it is the better
course to secure an adjudication from the
courts before proceeding to abate it.
This doctrine was laid down in the Spo
kane case already cited.
"It is very questionable whether in any
such case where there is a doubt as to
whether or not there may not be exist
ing rights in the person whose property
is sought to be destroyed the municipal
corporation should proceed to its de
struction without resort to a tribunal
which may determine the right of the
matter. â¢ â¢ â¢ "While .a well-constructed
street railroad may be a technical nui
sance, if unauthorized, it is not danger
ous to either life, health or property, and
so long as the courts are open to the de
termination of such controversies there
is no call for violence or any manner of
arbitrary or oppressive action."
As Indicated in my opening sentences,
the court has not the power to determine ,
in this litigation whether the so-called
Geary street turntable Is a nuisance or
not. " The defendants have not filed a
cross-complaint asking such adjudica
tion, and any attempt on the part of the
court to so adjudicate would be void and
outside of the issues. This was express
ly held in the case of Easton Passenger
Railway Company vs. Easton, 133 Pa.
St. 505. The court says:
"The defendants have no right in this
proceeding to ask this court to settle any
question affecting the rights of the city
in the matter in controversy. They have
not filed a cross-bill, nor have they ap
plied to this court or any other court to
adjust the differences between the city
and the appellant company. They have
no prayer for relief. On the contrary,
they have assumed to decide the delicate
questions involved for themselves and to
enforce their decision by the strong
hand. This cannot be permitted. We are
of opinion that their acts were unlaw
ful and that the plaintiff Is entitled to i
the relief prayed for."
I am therefore of the opinion that the
permanent injunction prayed for by the
plaintiff should be granted to the extent
that defendants be forever restrained '
and enjoined from removing the said
turntable by reason of the direction to
that effect contained in the resolution
complained of.
Nothing in this opinion is intended to
enjoin said defendants or any person
specially damaged by reason of the ex
istence of said turntable from commend
ing a proper action at law or in equity
looking to the condemnation of said turn
table as a nuisance.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRTL 4, 1599.
FLED SLAVEDOM
TO THE MISSION
THERE is a wailing and a gnashing of t^eth throughout all Chinatown;
there's been many a punk stick burned since yesterday morning's sun
broke through the recking smells and smoke, and many a parley held
in the odorous, fume-thickened alleys, and every wire that works an
influence between the haunts of the Celestials and the office of Chief of
Police Lees has been stretched to the point of breaking in an effort to have
little Yue Sin, the favorite of the beau monde of the district, returned to the
brothel -whence yesterday morning she fled to the protecting shades of the
Mc-thouiet Mission.
Since the day she arrived here under false papers, just one year ago, Yue
Sin has been the stellar attraction of the gay youth of Chinatown. Three
months before she left Hongkong she was sold by her own mother. Her
father, who was a worker In the rice fields, died when little Yue Sin was
only eight years old. The wage of the rice gatherpr is no larger than pro
vides his living, and he left nothing. Yue Sin's mother struggled against pov
erty and recurring sickness until the one daughter she had saved from "the
basket" was just 18, then she succumbed to her needs and to custom and sold
her into the life she was to lead in this country.
A year ago she was brought here by Moun Dong, one of the most infa
mous slave dealers of Ross alley, and her alleged husband, Chung Wing.
She was placed in a rooming house at S4 Hoss alley. Despite the fact that at
once she became a favorite of Chinatown's half world she only waited an
opportunity for escape, but it did not come until just before daybreak yester
day morning, when her keeper fell asleep.
Then she unlatched the door and stole out into thfÂ» darkness of the alley.
At the end of it she found Officers Ben Castle and William Armstrong, and
into their hands she put a letter from a Christianized Chinese of Hongkong,
asking the first American official into whose hands it should come to assist
its bearer out of slavery and to the Methodist Mission <>n Washington street.
The two officers at once took her to Mrs. Lake, the kindly matron of the
mission, where she told her story- She begged piteously for relief from the
life she had been forced to lead, and Mrs. Lake, after the fashion of the la
di'-s of the mission, responded by communicating at once with the Society
for the Prevention of Vice. The society reported to the Police Department,
and Officer I. Tuchler of the California street squad was detailed to go with
a search warrant to the rooming house at S.K Ross alley to get the girl's be
longings.
He called at the mission for Tue Sin. who was to accompany him and iden
tify hor things, and accompanied by Mrs. Lake they worked th^ir way
through a menacing crowd of Chinese that news of the escape had gathered.
The doors of the rooming house were slammed in his face, but with a resound
ing kick of his well heeled boot Tuchler disposed of the barricade and led the
plave girl to her rooms on the top floor of the building. There she found a
portion of her things, though her silks and her money had been abstracted
from her trunks at the first alarm.
Then Tuchler led his charge hack through the hallways, which hn<l bp
come crowded with a muttering, threatening horde nf Chinese, down through
the reeking alley and back to the pure air of thr- mission, where, Mrs Lake
says, she shall stay until she can be disposed of in a way that will redound
otherwise than to her ruin.

CONFIDENCE IN THE BANK.
San Luis Obispo Money Is Pouring
Into the Commercial.
A week or ten days ago the State Bank
Commissioners granted to the Commercial
Bank of San Luis Obippo permission to
resume business, the institution having
been obliged to close Its doors at the time
of the failure of the County Bank. As
soon as the permission was granted the
officers of the bank called a meeting of
those interested, and with one accord
they promised to do all in their power to
put the bank upon its feet again
I'nder the agreement the doors were
opened yesterday and the success met
with was so encouraging that the offi
cers sent a dispatch to the Commission
ers to the effect that more money had*
been received that day in the shape of de
posits than on any day since it first went
into business. The Comisisoners regard
this as an evidence of the confidence of
the people of the county in the future of
the institution and general prosperity of
that locality.

Richard Harvey, 36 Alemany street,

dered Sharp to vacate, which Sharp re
fused to do and had Harvey arrested
The evidence was long and contradictory
and the Judge dismissed the case telling
them to take their troubles to the Super

Ivan R. Lang, the bicyclist who was

SAVED FROM
DEATH BY A
VIGILANT CLERK
Two Boys Have a
Narrow Escape.
ARE ALMOST ASPHYXIATED
ONE LAD ACCIDENTALLY TURNS
GAS ON.
After Being Dragged From Their
Boom the Youths Are Resus
citated, but Not Without
Much Trouble.
Two boys named Ben McQuirk and
Donald McVlckera had a narrow escape
from death by gas asphyxiation yester
day morning.
Unmindful of parental warning the
boys went to Shell Mound Park, where
they drank considerable liquor. After re
turning 1 to this city they coxitinued their
libations until both were almost helpless
ly drunk. Rather than confront their
parents they decided to engage a room in
a lodging-house at 675 Mission street.
Some time after they had retired the
clerk of the house detected the odor of
escaping- gas, and he proceeded to make
an investigation. Suspecting: that the boys
had "blown out the gas," as he ex
pressed it, the clerk went to their room
and rapped for admittance. Failing to
get a response he burst open the door and
was almost overcome by the escaping
fluid. After hastily raising the windows
he dragged the unconscious boys into the
hallway. Then, thinking that they were
about to die, the clerk summoned the po
lice officer on the beat, who sent In a call
for thÂ« Receiving Hospital ambulance.
While waiting for the ambulance the
policeman, assisted by the clerk, carried
the boys downstairs. McVickers soon re
vived and begged not to be taken to the
hospital.
"Please don't take me to the hospital?"
pitifully remarked the unfortunate
youth. " "I would rather have died in the
room than to have my poor mother know
of my narrow escape. If she finds out
that I was so nearly asphyxiated I know
it will break her heart."
McQuirk, who is a messenger boy, also
recovered in a short time, and. like his
companion, pleaded not to he taken to
the hospital. As the doctor who was in
charge of the ambulance which arrived
a few minutes later was convinced that
the boys had recovered fmm the effects
of the gas they had inhaled the police
man took them to the City Prison, where
they were charged with being drunk.
McQuirk seemed to be in a stupor and
begged to be allowed to go to sleep..
<V I don't know how it happened," he re
marked when trying to explain how the
gas was turned nn. "Aft^r renting the
room I fell on the bed, first telling: my
companion to turn off the gas. It was
only a short time afterward that I was
awakened by the smoll of escaping gas,
and although I realized that we were in
danger of being asphyxiated I did not
have sufficient strength left to assist my-
Belf or McVickers. While I could not
hl'c-.ik I was extremely happy when the
clerk burst open the door and dragged
me out into the fresh air."
On being, told of the narrow escape of
the boys from occupying slabs in the
Morgue, Captain Spillane. convinced that
they had entirely recovered from the ef
fects of the liquor and gas. ordered them
released on their own recognizance.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 3.â The usual accumu
lation over Sunday of "buy it the market" or
.ders caused a buoyant opening in many stocks.
Tho dealings were on a tremendous scale, par
ticularly in the morning, and the total trans
actions were over a million and a quarter
shares. The most sensational advances were
among the specialties, many of which main
tained gains to the close, although the rail
â ways eased oft". The legal rate. 6 per cent,
was the prevailing figure for call money on
good collateral, but the rarige for the lay was
" from 5 to S, with the closing at the lower fig
ure. Although the London market was closed
because of the Easier holidays, arbitrage
brokers put out some lines of stock in the ex
pectation of getting them back cheaper in
London to-morrow. The market throughout
â¢was highly speculative, with rapid advances
and declines. Manhattan on tremendous deal
ings maintained an advance of S points. The
Stock was apparentl> controlled by pool oper
ations, supports being extending on decline*
and much realizing appearing at the high fig
ures. Federal Steel, on transactions second
only to those of Manhattan, sold early at the
highest figures yet reached and then receded
sharply, leaving a nil loss â â ; I*2. The pre
ferred advanced about as much. American
fcteel was pushed up three points. Missouri Pa
cihc. on trading ol over 10,000 shares, ad
vanced three points on buying by a pool sup
posed to include s some of the Insiders. Kansas
and Texas preferred at the same time was
marked up over a point.
The announcement of the privilege to sub
scribe for new stock in Brooklyn Transit, to-
Kether with an erroneous report of a cash divi
dend declaration, caused the stock to sell up
to 136, but it receded sharply, leaving a net
decline of over two points at the close. The
trading in some half dozen specialties nearly
â tqualed the dealings in all the rest of the list.
. The most conspicuous advances were: Third
' Avenue S, North American 5*4, International
.Taper "â <. Tin Plate 4^, Tennessee Coal 4\
and Sugar 3. Pacific 1!!. Delaware and
' Lackawunna, Mexican Central and Western
. Union were spots of strength. Burlington,
â¢' P ennpyivonia. New York Central and North
fern Pacific suffered declines of a point and
over. Kansas City, Pltt.-burg and Gulf and
Metropolitan were weak.
"The closing of the general market was weak.
; It developed after the close of business that a
deal had been effected between Manhattan and
Third' avenue railway companies.
Considerable irregularity prevailed in to
day's bond market, with th( more prominent
issues sagging. Total sales, $3,485,400. United
States, fives advanced i, but the threes lost
>i in the bid nrlce.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 3.â There was a decidedly
, strong tone in the wheat pit at the start. May
j opened %'g'ic higher at from 7?.%c to 73% c
and during the first few minutes trading ad
vanced to 73% c. The strength at the opening
was as a consequence of an official report from
Missouri estimating the crop condition at 66
in that State, a drop of 14 points from the
condition a year r.go. The weather through
out the Northwest was still unseasonably cold,
but there were predictions of springlike weath
er for to-morrow. Under the Influence of a
prospective modification of the temperature
(â peculators forgot all about accomplished dam
age and they soli on the advance. As the ses
sion progressed visions of s] routing seeds an.l
budding trees rose in the minris of traders and
heavy liquidation set in. Tins selling changed
the market from the extreme of buoyant light
ness to heavy depression. May whÂ«at slipped
off quickly to 71 Â«c. The heavy receipts also
encouraged selling. Atlantic port trances
of wheat and flour were equal to 297.000 hush
els. The domestic visible showed a decrease of
but 80,000 bus nets, Instead of about dOU,WO, as
expected. Covering by shorts at the declines
caused a slight rally near the end and .Ma,
closed at 71 '/jig 72- The weakness of wheat
and liquidation by loading bull concerns weak
ened corn. May closed 4.@Uc lower.
There was an excellent demand for both May
and July oats, the latter option being espe
cially wanted. May closed a shade lower.
Provisions were sustained under the weak
ness of the surrounding grain markets by the
revelations of the monthly stock taking, which
Showed apparently that the great receipts of
hogs are no more thun sufficient to satisfy
current requirements of the foreign and do
mestic consumers. May pork closed 24'Â§7>c
lower and lard and ribs left off practically
unchanged.

Iron Molder Gwynne
Makes a Reform.
HOW HIS DIAMOND WAS LOST
WORTH A HUNDRED, IT WAS AP
PRAISED AT FIFTEEN.
Refused to Accept the Smaller Sum
and the Secretary of the Treas
ury Sees Justice
Done.
John Gwynne, a humble molder at the
â Union Iron Works, has been made, un
wittingly, the instrument for effecting a j
much-needed reform in the San Francis
co Custom-house, namely, that of one
employe â  tiring a receipt from another i
cv passing over any valuable article of j
personal property, such as jewelry and
precious stones. Up to a week or two j
ago these articles passed from one per
son to another in the Custom-house
without a receipt, and in case of loss or j
theft there was no sure way of tracing j
the culprit or lixing the responsibility.
Something more than a year ago John j
Gw.vnne received from his sister in Wales
a diamond ring through the registered
nail. lie had furnished the ring him
eelf, paying $12 for the gold in it, and j
Eent it to his sister, who had the dia
mond set in it as a gift to him.
Oji its arrival at the Tostoffice it was
handed over to a customs officials for ex
amination, the Postoifice authorities tak
ing a receipt for the same. Then it was
tent' to the Appraiser's department, j
where it was appraised by Examiner
George Keynolds at $15, for the purpose
of fixing the duty upon it. When Gwynne j
â  called tor the ring he was informed that
It had been lost in the Custom House. He
was offered $15, the appraised value of
. the piece of jewelry, but refused to ac
cept it, as ho claimed that the ring was I
worth Â£21, or Â»1"5.
Mr. Gwynne, llnding that he could get |
no higher offer, laid the matter before
the Svcrctar.% of the Treasury, and that ;
oihciiil requested Special Agents Smith
and Linck to Investigate. Mr. Gwynne
appeared before them and presented a
ct-rttneate from the English jeweler who
had set the diamond setting forth its
value at JIUI or $H's. Other evidence cor
roborated Mr. Gwynne's statement and i
the .jeweler's certificate, and the result '
was that the special agents made over
tures to Mr. Gwynne for a compromise.
Ih- agreeing to split the difference and
Bi'cept in full payment of his claim $60,
hulf the value of his ring, and let by
gones be bygones. The agents were sat
isfied with the offer and made a report
to the Secretary of the Treasury recom
mending that the San Francisco Custom- i
house be instructed to pay Mr. Gwynne
"*s<;:ln lieu of his ring and take his re
rejpt and a release from all responsibil- \
ity in the matter.
â  VYben the agents were investigating the ,
loss they ino.uired whether there was a :
reason for the absence tn the Custom
house of a system of receipts for portable i
.valuables; such as exists in the registered
mail department of the postoffice. They j
were informed that the receipt system
tvould not be practicable in the Custom
house, but no valid reason was urged for
tills belief. The agent smiled at the ox- ;
cuse and insisted that the system of giv
ing and taking receipts for portable prop
erty should be inaugurated at once. It is
now in full swing and is working like .
plockwork. Henceforth, when an article
:s lost in the Custom-house, the person in i
whose care it disappeared will be known
and the damage can be assessed to the
responsible party.
Itfr. Reynolds' explanation of his ap
praising at $15 a diamond ring containing
U'2 worth of. gold, a setting worth $S ana
a diamond of the first water worth $S3
was that he took the ring to a jeweler,
who informed him that it was worth no j
more than $15. On being asked for the :
name of tho jeweler he replied that he ,
rould not remember.
In their report the agents say that the i
Appraiser's employe honestly believed
the ring to bo worth no more than the j
Value placed by him upon it. he not being
an expert in such matters, and th:!t prob
ably he had not gone to a jeweler at all, j
but thought that he had. the transaction
having taken place considerably more
than a year ago.
DROPPED FROM THE ROLL.
Bix Patrolmen and a Corporal Re
tired by Pension Commissioners.
The Police Pension Commissioners held

Ing and seven of the men on the list pub

have in their possession the evl
ili.nce that is necessary to convict. The
offenders have been formally charged
and the affair is now within the jurisdic
tion of the Police Judges.
Vnder these conditions it would seem
that the outcome would be easy to predict.
Experience has taught differently, how
ever, as panderers of filth and corrupters
of children sometimes enjoy political
pulls. Frank Kane, the secretary of the
y for the Prevention of Vice, says
that Police Judges are sometimes very
erratic. An incident that happened yes
terday justified his assertion and explains
his meaning. Justice of the Peace Barry,
whom an accident has raised to the Mig
nity of an acting Police Judge, released
f the offenders on his own recognlz
while Police Judge Graham held an
r for the same offense on a bond of
This fact needs no criticism. In the
same connection it is perhaps slgnflcant
that Police Captain \\ ittm;m did abso
lutely nothing to enforce the law against
;>ublic display of immorality in the
district over which he has supervision,
while Police Captain Spillane acted vlgor
and with success in the raid that is
led to protect decent people and in
nocent children from the contamination of
vice openly flaunted.
Secretary Frank Kane was the first to
yesterday. He secured warrants for
..rsest of M. Kollman of S4S Kearny
street and M. S. Levy at 415 Kearny
street. Tho warrants wore procured on
barge that these men were violating
Order No. - y -~< of the General Orders of
the Board of Supervisors. This order
prohibits the exhibition of Indecent plc
and as Secretary Kane has what
he deems Is sufficient evidence against the
arrested men. ho hopes to secure a con
viction. He has. in his personal investi
gation, seen enough to become an im
portant witness as well as an accuser.
Kollman was taken after his arrest be
fore Acting Police Judge Barry and was
released on his own recognizance. Levy
was liberated upon supplying a bond for
Levy's establishment is one of the
vilest of those that are maintained on the
public thoroughfares. It is located in the
district over which Captain Wlttman ex
es an alleged vigilance. Wittman
has permitted the place to exist for
months in flagrant violation of the law,
and even after his attention had been
i idled to it he saw no reason to take ac
tion.
Acting under orders from Policy Captain
Spillane, Officers Tyrrell and Esola also
made a raid, armed with warrants for
Peter Bacigalupi. the panderer and chief,
and M. Kollman and John Carroll, whose
vice-breeding shop is at 724 Market street.
These three places are the only ones
within the police district governed by Po
ll. â¢ Captain Spillane. But Kollman and
Carroll were arrested, but Bacigalupi
ROl be found. He was reported to
have left the <i sy . but will be arrested as
as he returns.
Tho police are acting In their arrests
upon the authority given in Order LSS7,
in 20, of the General Orders of the
Supervisors. This order is simi
lar In intent to No. 2525. although Secre
tary Kano believes that convictions may
be more easily obtained under No. 2525
than under No. 1557. The examination of
th. arrested men will be held this morn
ing.
It is a matter of Incidental Interest per
haps that Bacigalupi has recently gone
further in his effrontery than ever be
fore. He sought and almost obtained
the right to make his establishment even
more offensive to the public than It is by
displaying a great illuminated sign.
Mayor Phelan and the Supervisors, at the
meeting of the board yesterday, can
; a permit granted to Bacigalupi, at
the last meeting, to erect an advertising
sign in front of his "phonograph par
lors." The matter came up on final pas
sage. The clerk had been reading various
resolutions In a mechanical way, but this
one attracted the attention of his Honor
the Mayor. "Read that again, please,"
he said. When the resolution had been
read he said: "I desire to call the atten
tion of the board to this resolution. It
grants one Bacigalupi, proprietor of a
phonograph and moving-picture show, the
right to erect an attractive sign such as
the theaters have.
"He wants to advertise a lewd picture
show. What Is the pleasure of the board
in this matter?"
Many members objected to tho granting
of the privilege. A motion made by Su-
I ervisor Deasy that the consideration of
the matter be indefinitely postponed was
carried unanimously. The proposed ad
vertisement will not be displayed.
It is not by any means tho intention of
the authorities to stop in the work they
have so well begun. While the arrest
and conviction of the shopkeepers will
do much to cripple the disgusting traf
fic, against which complaint has been
made, something more thorough must be
done before the trade in vice is destroyed.
There is not the slightest doubt that the
vicious machines, the "artoscopes,"
"mutosoopes" and "vitascopes," may be
condemned and confiscated. It is the pur-
POM of the authorities to seize those ma
chines and make their owners fight for
them. In all of the establishments lewd
and ribald songs are ready for the phono
graph and are subject to confiscation.
When tho authorities commence this cru
sade it will be the beginning of the end
of the depraving business.
After the attack hats been completed
upon the source of the evil, raids will be
made upon the saloons and resorts among
which tho vile machines are scattered.
Every week the subjects are changed In

is it the purpose of the authorities to

A Business-Like Burglar.
John Haley, an ex-convict, was ar
rostftl yesterday and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of burglary. On
January 9 he drove up to a grocery at
Sixth and Bryant streets and got the
key to a vacant house at 421 Sixth street,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1899.
NO MERCHANTS'
COMPROMISE FOR
SCHOOL TEACHERS
They Have a Plan of
Their Own.
BALANCE GOES TO CREDITORS
CURRENT FTTNDS MTJST NOT BE
INTERFERED WITH.
If Tradesmen Do Not Wish to Accept
the Teachers' Terms the Fight
Will Be Inaugu
rated.
The teachers have thrown down the
gauntlet and are out making terms them
selves. They have refused the compromise
submitted by the merchants and have
submitted a plan of their own which, It
has been reported, is acceptable to the
other side; should it not prove so, how
ever, they will fight in court or out of it,
on the balance for the past six months or
on the money for the months to come.
The meeting called for yesterday after
noon attracted several hundred teachers,
the session be-inff in the auditorium of the
Girls' High School. It was for the pur
pose of taking definite action on the ques
tion of compromise, and the action taken
was definite enough for anybody.
A substitute for the plan offered by the
merchants was submitted and was adopt
ed in the form of three resolutions. They
were as follows:
Resolved, That the committee on litigation
be and Is hereby directed to dismiss the
litigation so far as the payment of the so
oalled merchants' claims are concerned, pro
vided :
IâThat1 â That there be no assignment of teachers'
claims.
2â That the holders of the merchants' claims
a^ree not to collect the same out of the moneys
provided for the last six months of the fiscal
year.
3â That If the terms of compromise In ac
cordance with the provisions of this resolu
tion cannot be made, that the committee be
and is hereby directed to prufecute the pend
ing litigation and to take such further legal
steps as may be necessary.
These resolutions were not all adopted
ax the same time. The first two were
brought up by themselves and were
passed and then the last was considered.
It was suggested that instead of settling
the matter right then and there it would
be better to have the committee report
back to the teachers and then allow them
to decide on further proceedings, but it
was finally decided to place the committee
In a position to give the merchants a
definite Idea as to the stand of the teach
ers In the matter.
The meeting opened with an explanation
by F. H. Clark of the Lowell High School
as to matters which had been investigat
ed and Information which had been ob
tained since the previous mooting. It was
shown by him and by subsequent speak
ers that the letters received from the
Auditor. Treasurer and President of the
Board of Kducatlon were written under a
misapprehension. and communications
from the three officials were read to show
the view they had come to take of the
situation. Auditor Wells wrote to say
that he would support the board In its
endeavor to secure to the two coming
months their full share of the half of the
year's appropriation.
The board contended that it was en
titled to one-half of the year's appropria
tion to run the school department from
January to July. I. J. Truman, Treas
urer, wrote to say that when he had ad
vised that the teachers accept the offer of
the merchants he believed It referred to
the $35,000 balance from the last half of
the fiscal year. Instead of the funds for
the current half as well. He declared
that under such circumstances the teach
ers should never compromise. President
Bergerot wrote that he, too, had misun
derstood the terms of the compromise,
and so he would withdraw his recom
mendation that they accept, in view of
the increased importance which tho mnt
ter had takt-n In his eyes, and ho would
not take the responsibility of advising
thorn.
A resolution was adopted requiring tho
litigation committee to mak? a report
upon its finances and also if there Is any
thing due. The resolution at the same
time pledged the teachers to pay prompt
ly all that may be owing.
"On motion It was decided to fill tho va
cancy on the litigation committee made
by the resignation of Professor Lyser,
and Mr. Clark was proposed. l T ndor the
formation of the committee, however, the
only one eligible was a grammar school
teacher, and Mr. Clark was of the High
School. Mrs. L. K. Burke, principal of
the Columbia School, was therefore added
to the committee.
looses Her Position.
Judge Hunt denied a motion for a new
trial in the ease of Elizabeth P. Bradley
against the Hoard of Education yester
day. Miss Bradley sought to be rein
stated in the School Department as a
special teacher of drawing, but the court
refused to reinstate her. holding that the
School Board had authority to abolish
all special classes.
PICNICKERS IN COURT.
Aftermath of the Opening Day of the
Season at Schuetzen.
Several participants in the opening pic
nic of the season at Schuetzen Park Sun
day made their appearance in the Police
Courts yesterday, but the Judges were
lenient with them and they were dis
charged.
Richard Eagan and James Murphy, two
husky youths, quarreled about the tem
porary companionship of a young girl at
the picnic, but they ciifi not come to blows
till they reached Third and Mission streets
on their way home. Murphy was getting
the worst of the fight when Policeman
Menlhan happened along and placed both
under arrest for disturbing the peace. In
Judge Conlan's court yesterday morning
they refused to divulge the name of the
young girl, and as they shook hands and
agreed to be friends the Judge dismissed
the case.
A. S. Field, a painter from Stockton,
was also at the picnic with Emma Hold
and Nellie Doherty. It was proved by the
two women that Field had thrown a $10
gold piece on the counter at the park for
drinks and the bartender nearly fainted at
the flight of so much coin. The Judge
thought it was lucky for Field that he got
back to the city In safety after recklessly
displaying so much wealth.
The charge against Field was for steal
ing $24 from Emma Meyer, 335 Bush
street. He had called upon Miss M?yer
Sunday morning and she rushed the
"growler." After Field departed she al
leges that she missed the $24 and sus
pected him of taking It. When she learned
that Field had displayed a $10 gold piece
at the picnic her suspicions were con
firmed and she had him arrested. Field
declared that the $10 piece was his own
property, and the Judge gave him the
benefit of the doubt and dismissed the
case.
Struck by a Car.
James Burns, the driver of a dirt cart,
was seriously injured last evening. Burns
was driving along Folsom street and
when near Sixth his cart was run into
by an electric car. Burns was thrown
from his spat, sustaining a laceration of
the forehend and a deep cut over the left
eye. One of his ribs was also fractured.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where his Injuries were dressed by Po
lice Surgeon Well.
Will Marry To-Day.
Frederick A. Driscoll and Katheryn M.
Pouleon will be married to-day. Driscoll
is a prominent young druggist of this city,
but for some reason has endeavored to
keep his coming marriage secret. The li
cense was obtained on the Ist Inst. and to
day will see the ceremony performed.

last night to a fair-sized audience, j
The first night of a new piece at the
Tivoli is generally subject to halts and
hitches and this one was no exception.
The Tivoli's "Beautiful Goldenlocks" {
will have to be trimmed and brushed
down. This can be accomplished in a
night or two; and then, by all the signs
of previous Eddy-street successes, the
production ought to be good for quite
a run. For it is stuffed with just the
sort of tunes, pictures and nonsense
that the patrons like.
Scenically it is perhaps the neatest
achievement in the history of the house.
The rose-bower scene in the second act
is as gorgeous as the interior of a ten
dollar Easter egg, and the scene of the
Prince's palace is as incandescent as
old David Henderson at his best. In
the rose scene fifteen girls dance a cozy
little ballet, full of pretty figures, and j
a soloist foots it daintily over a skip- j
ping rope. In the same scene Ed i
Stevens sings another song of many I
nations, while the girls contribute a j
complete lightning change of costume
to each chorus in full view of the au
dience â an odd and picturesque idea
cleverly worked out. By the time the ;
fourth chorus was reached last night
the Tivuladies were down to close j
tunics and knee-breechea. The crowd I
encored wildly, but the raiment re- !
mained stationary.
In the palace scene in the last act
Mr. Stevens gives an exhibition in leg
erdemain. He started out by asking
any person in the audience to please
give him n small oblong table thirty- I
two inches in height, and a bunch of :
canary birds. And would any clergy- j
man present kindly oblige him with a j
pack of cards. And everybody thought
that the Stevens necromancy was go
ing to be merely another of the Stevens
jokes. But it turned out quite another j
thing. The comedian displayed a re- j
markable fluency in the sleight-of-hand
tricks (and the; are always the best) ; !
and a fair manipulation of the ma- ,
gician's apparatus. These apparatus ;
tricks will doubtless improve with a ,
few performances, and the sleieht-of
hand will be even better for a more ! '
constant flow of side talk. Silence is ! i
the modern magician's worst enemy.
All in all, the show is jolly, fresh and
entertaining in the right irresponsible
way. What little plot there is is based
on the tales of "Beauty and the Beast." j
and "Cinderella," with generous inter- |
ruptions by dances, songs and special- I (
ties. Miss Lachter walks and warbles \
through the title part; Miss Holmes i
and Miss Hill are courageously the |
ugly sisters; Miss Helen Merrill is the j
shapely good fairy in tropic clothes,
and Miss Meyers is th. Bowery boy. as
bad as only a woman can make him. i
Mr. Stevens is programmed as Mr. All
sortsofvice, a modern Mephisto, and \
the part is elastic enough to give him >
plenty of good comic play. Branson is ;
something bettor than his usual self
as the father of the girls, and Messrs.
Pruette and Schuster are as ever. Mr.

The pleasant method and beneficial

Stbui- of Figs, manufactured by the

the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting-
them in the form most refreshing- to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-

dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-

every objectionable quality and sub-

setting a number of orchestra seats aside
at 50 cents and 75 cents and reducing the
entire orchestra to 50 cents. It is to be
hoped that this will attract the patronage

Orpheum.
Josephine Gassman, a San Francisco
girl, aided and abetted by a brace of wee
pickaninnies as black as Miss Gassman '
makes up, divides the honors at the Or- :
pheum this week with Kara, who plays
toss-up with a table, a hatrack and an
able-bodied man simultaneously and does
other wonderful feats in the juggling line.
Two years ago Miss Gassman began her ,
professional career as a soubrette at a
local theater. Now she is doing the clev
erest "coon" turn yet seen here. Her ,
two miniature assistants are a clever at
traction in themselves.
Kara is billed as the "world's greatest
juggler," and there doesn't seem to be
anybody in these parts who cares to dis
pute his claim. The Hengler sisters are
bewitching dancers, but were they to for
get to vocalize nobody In the audience
would call their attention to the over
sight.

Matweef troupe are as popular as they

. Alhambra.
Agnes Herndon commenced the third
week of her engagement at the Alhambra
last night in an English drama called
"Married, Not Mated." The play Is by
far the best the present management has
presented. It served to interest the audi
ence and was well acted. Miss Herndon
gave a clever performance of Lady Vida
Harrington, and a really artistic portrai
ture of Susan Scroope was given by
Laura Alberta, who scored an unmistaka
ble hit. "Â«_
Alcazar.
The presentation of Belaaco and De
Mine's "Charity Ball" filled the cozy au
ditorium of the Alcazar last night with
an audience that laughed and cried by
turns. It is a play that affords opportu
nity for every member of a large com
pany to do artistic work, and' the excel
lent company at the Alcazar embraced
and one another. Ernest Hastings as
John Van Buren, Adelaide Fitz Allen as
Ann Kruger, Margaret Marshall as Mrs.
Van Buren, Juliet Crosby as Phyllis Lee,
Laura Crews as Bess, Clarence Montaine
as Judge Knox and Daniel Halifax as
Alec caught the sympathies and drew
smiles and .tears from the appreciative

day evenings and Friday afternoon. The
subjects are: "The Annals of Drum
tocnty," "Certain Traits of Scottish Na

The Chutes.
Joe Storms Jr., orang-outang, Sally,
chimpanzee, and Congo, gorillaman, are
the latest additions to the vaudeville
rankâ As a "triumvirate" they made
their appearance at the Chutes Free j
Theater last evening and stood the blaze
of the calcium fairly well. Joe donned
his whiskers, tipped his hat on the side:
and began to smoke his pipe when the
band played "'St. Patrick's Day." Then
he became embarrassed. "Sally in Our
Alley" was substituted and the â  chim
panzee suffered from stage fright. Congo
made no complaint against "Who's Dat
Said Chicken?" and the accompanying
lecture on the Darwinian theory was
greatly enjoyed by a large audience.
Olympia.
The four Miltons made quite a hit at
the Olympia last night. They excel as
musical artists and rendered some very
pleasing numbers. Querita Vincent is still
the feature of the bill. Last night she
had a number of new songs and was re- !
called time and time again. She is the

YEARS OF TORTURE.
Relief at Hand Had He Only Known Where
to Look For It.
Let us, my good friends, always suit
our tools to the work to be done. We
do not trim our nails with broadswords
or carve statues with adzes. Now a
word is a tool just as a hoe is, or a ra
zor. The figure of Liberty on a quarter
of a dollar is impressed there by a ma
chine made for the purpose. By the
same token words were invented to im
print thoughts and ideas on the minds
of others. And every word or expres
sion has a currency meaning of its own
so long as we refrain from using it
in a slack or careless way.
Just as the Lord Mayor's coach, or
one's own best clothes are not intended
for every little trumpery occasion, so
great words should be reserved till the
time comes when nothing else will do.
When a man singes his whiskers by the
slovenly handling of a lighted match
we do not rouse up the fire department.
Now the word "excruciating" is one
of the strongest words in the English
language. It tingles with sharp signifi
cance as a black cat's back snaps with
electricity on a frosty night. Only shal
low people will take liberties with this
word. In our ordinary talk it does not
come properly into play once a year;
and rightly so. For it alludes to a kind
of mental or physical suffering that we
desire to avoid thinking or speaking
of. If the root meaning of the word
"excruciating" escapes you for a mo
ment look it up in the dictionary. It is
a word with a pedigree, and its ances
tors have supped with horrors since
men began to make history.
The question then that you and I
have to settle is, whether Mr. Geo. B.
Simpson employed this dignified and
exclusive word justifiably when he said,
"I was troubled twelve years with
much pain in the small of my back. So
continuous was it that I ceased to take
pleasure in work. Indeed I ceased to
take pleasure altogether. With me life
got to be a thing to endure, not to en
joy. I am speaking within bounds
when I say that at times these pains
were excruciating.
"With the pains in my back I suf
fered from terrible periodic headaches
and profound mental depression. I was
a prey to anxiety and apprehension, the
cause of which I was unable to lo
ratp or understand. Yet to look at me
you would hardly have fancied my true
condition. Sometimes when appearing
at my best and receiving the congratu
lations of my friends on what they were
pleased to call my obvious improve
ment, I still felt wretched and miser
able. But nobody sympathized with
me. I suppose it was because I was not
emaciated or run down as persons with
dangerous diseases are commonly sup
posed to be.
"While on this point, I may perhaps
be permitted to say that affections of
the kidneys, even Bright's disease
itself, often co-exist with a generally
healthy external appearance on the
part of the patient. The poor fellow
may be within a few weeks of his death
and yet to the uninstructed eye look
well enough to pass for a sound man.

high colored and offensive, with a con
siderable brick dust deposit. I can
not set forth in writing what I suffered',
and shall not try. The headaches alone
I thought a sufficient punishment for
such unconscious offenses in the matter
of eating and drinking as had brought
this complaint upon me."
[The editor begs to interrupt Mr.
Simpson to remind him, and others as
well, that in inflicting penalties Nature
never stops for a moment to consider
whether the offenses were consciously
committed or not. Juries and judges
are continually moved either by sym
pathy for the prisoner or prejudice
against him. Nature is cold as a tomb
stone, yet perfectly fair and impartial.
Whether you take a dose of poison ig-,
norantly or unintentionally, or with the
purpose to commit suicide, the result is
j precisely the same. Nature will not
push you over the cliff, neither will she
put out her hand to save you from
being dashed to pieces. Think of this
when you are tempted to meddle with
her arrangements.]
"The doctors," continues Mr. Simp
son, "gave me no relief, although I con
sulted many and followed their direc
tions faithfully. I do not blame them,
for they did their best; and I cannot
praise them as their best was no ad
vantage to me.
"It was my custom to buy my toilet
articles at the Walker-Rintels Drug
Co., 244 Boylston street, and one day I
told Mr. D. Wallace Rintels about my
condition and the failure of the doctors
to help me. He at once suggested the
use of Warner's Safe Cure. As to the
! virtue of this medicine, although I ha
â¢ hfard of it, I was very skeptical. I
| considered the advertised statements
! of its merits exaggerated, yet I bought
a bottle on the bare chance of its doing
me good. After having taken a few
doses my headaches were certainly less
frequent and less intense. Greatly de
\ lighted at this hopeful outcome I kept
on taking the medicine regularly and
improved steadily; and before long the
symptoms I have named wholly disap
| peared.
"At the date of this writing I have
j been well long enough to make sure
that my cure is radical and permanent.
In spite of the pain and peril of those
twelve fearful years I have to-day as
good an appetite, as clear a head and
as sound a body as any man in Boston,
As an illustration of it I need only say
that the very Insurance company which
had previously rejected me on account
of an 'Incurable disease of the kidneys'
has since written a heavy policy on my
life. I weigh more than I used to do
and my flesh is healthy and solid. I am
rid of the puffiness which marks the
chronic sufferer from kidney trouble.
And for this transformation I hereby
acknowledge Indebtedness to Warner's
l Safe Cure and that only." George B.
Simpson, 23 Church street, Boston.
What is popularly called kidney
trouble is shown by modern investiga
tion to have several forms. It is al
ways a dangerous and deceptive condi
tion, sometimes slowly and sometimes
rapidly progressive, and liable to term
inate fatally even when the immediate
symptoms seem to be least alarming.
Thousands of casualties attributed to
other causes are really due to diseased
kidneys. The success for many years
of Warner's Safe Cure in relieving and
curing this subtle disease has won for
it the world-wide reputation it now en-
I joys. When kidney symptoms declare
| themselves, do not hesitate to use War
ner's Safe Cure. The risk is not in re
sorting to this remedy, but in neglect
' ing it.

SHALL FABIOLA
RAVE A RACE
TRACK BENEFIT?
T. H. Williams Has
Made the Offer.
QUESTION UNDER DEBATE
DAN BURNS' POLITICS IS A BIG
FACTOR.
Acquisition of Funds Said to Be an
Urgent Necessity for the Treas
ury of the Great Insti
tution.
â â â^â _
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, I
90S Broadway, April 3.
Snail Fabiola have for its annual benefit |
a May day fete, an equine parade, a bene- |
fit at the race track, or nothing? This is
the question with which the directors of
the hospital find themselves face to face.
For four years past the greatest social
event of the year has been Fabiola day.
May day is less than a month off, and as
yet no notice has been given of what may
be expected.
Last year the racetrack management
gave Fabiola the entire proceeds of one
day at the track, and hung up a splendid
purse for a race known as the Fabiola
derby. On this occasion T. H. Williams
and his friends forbade any one from en
tering the track without paying their dol
lar. He was so interested in Fabiola that
he personally declined the offer of a pass
to enter his own property, and on the i
eventful day Mr. Williams and the officers
of the track passed through the gates,
accidentally, of course, just at the mo
ment when several of the lady directors
of Fabiola were entering. The ladies were
more than gratified to see Mr. Williams
and his friends contribute their dollars
and attached the tickets to their coat j
buttons with as much humility as the j
humblest tout about the place.
As a result of Fabiola day at the race
track a sum exceeding- $4000 was netted
for the hospital. There was, however, I
Borne opposition to the benefit. Many min
isters denounced the scheme from their
pulpits as being unworthy of such a no
lle institution. This charge was ably
defended by the ladies, who declared that
they were working for the most unself
ish of motives and were giving all their
time and energy toward building up thai
benevolent Institution, and were, there
fore, entitled to immunity from criticism.
One of the lady managers put forward
the argument that there is somewhere in j
the Scriptures a story telling how the!
Nazarene advocated even the breaking j
of the Sabbath to pull a sheep out of the I
pit. because it was a deed of charity. The :
deduction from this was very simple, and
In spite of the opposition the ladies went
ahead.
A few days ago Thomas H. Williams
In a lettrr very cordially reminded the
ladies that May day was again approach
ing and tendered them the use of the
track on the same conditions as last year. '
The letter was discussed at a meeting of
the lady managers, but as it was de- !
sired to olrtain the expression of the full i
board before taking decisive action the
matter was laid over until the next meet
ing, which occurs next Tuesday.
Many of the ladies are of the same opin- !
ion as they were last year and believed !
that In this case the end justifies the I
means, while others doubt the propriety
of accepting a benefit from the track
managers.
The recent bitter fight over Colonel
Burns In the Legislature and the bitter
ness with which Burns and his gambling
fraternity were denounced by the Minis
ters' Association of Oakland are not for
gotten, and the action the ministers
â would take should a benefit be accepted
from the racetrack management is hard
ly problematical. Last year, when the
opposition was engendered, very little was
known generally of the connection of Col
onel Burns with the Oakland track, and I
the ministers were more general than i
specific In their denunciation. This year
the associations of Burns and his outfit
are prominent in the minds of everybody
especially in this county, and one of the
ministers, who would not assume to speak
â with authority for his brethren, said to
day that there Is no doubt that their opin
ion of the racetrack benefits Is the same
as It was last year.
Fabiola. like all other institutions of
Its character, has suffered financially be
cause of the general closeness of money
during the past few years, and it needs
all the help it can command. It would
be a great hardship for it to be deprived
of four or five thousand dollars at this
time, according to the managers, who
deeply feel the responsibility of their
trust.
The question of the Fabiola benefit Is
the most prominent of the hour In Oak
land, for It Interests the management so
ciety at large, the church folks and the
racetrack management, all to a great de
gree. :

SIGNATURE LAW
An Oakland Newspaper Will Take
No Chances, but Obeys the Stat
utes on Police Items.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 3.
r< jnX-RENATOR DAROTE. proprietor for a quarter of a century of the
i. H Oakland Tribune and one of the best-known newspaper men in the
t>. [_> State> intends t0 take no chances with the law requiring newspapers
â *â* and their employes to sign all articles tending to show up the faults of
Q one living or to blacken the memory of one dead.
I There is some doubt as to whether the law goes into effect to-day or to
Â£ morrow, but Senator Dargie is too good a citizen and has too conscientious
h a respect for the law not to obey it. In to-night's issue of his paper all
* articles that could possibly be construed as coming under the new law were
/ signed by their writers.
y This practical demonstration of the absurdity of the new law is all that
0, is needed to convince the public of its foolishness. One of the articles
q, duly signed refers to a Mr. Brandes, who on Saturday last, after one of
fc the most conscientious and best tried trials in Alameda County, was con
h vtcted of brutally murdering his only daughter, and he escaped the gal
*. lows only because there was a reasonable doubt ac to his intent to beat the
V- girl to death when he murderously assaulted her. Of this brute the Tribune
X says: "For once a murderer will secure his deserts upon whom will not be
hnished the sympathy of foolish women and weak-minded sentimentalists,
y for it is Impossible for any one to entertain the slightest feeling of pity
Z for a man who could flog his child to death."
Last night another child-beater was lodged in the County Jail, and in
*, presenting the news Senator Dargie's paper tells the truth regarding him.
t This article under the law requires a signature and consequently is duly
5 attested, although the girl's body is covered with black and blue marks
X which the prisoner admitted Inflicting upon her for taking a piece of
Â£ Easter cake.
% Without the signature any "grafter" could ask the courts to compel the
publisher of the Tribune to pay him $2000 for these articles.

Fractured His Skull.
OAKLAND, April 3.â John Broderiok.
residing at 813 Filbert street, was found
lying on the sidewalk on Linden street,
near Seventh street, this morning with
his skull fractured. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where, after being
somewhat revived, he stated that he had
i been knocked down and kicked in the
j head by Frank Jackson, a colored man.
Jackson was soon rounded up by De
tectives Shorey and Hodgkins and is be-
I ing detained at the City Prison, awaiting
I developments In his victim's condition.
The physicians at the hospital this
afternoon trephined Broderick's skull and
his condition is serious.
Four Divorces Granted.
OAKLAND, April 3.â Superior Judge
I Ellsworth to-day granted four decrees of
i divorce. Mary A. Case was given a
i divorce from James K. Case on the
i grounds of extreme cruelty and willful
' j desertion. She was given the custody of
! the minor child and $25 monthly alimony.
i Maud Dawson sustained her charge of
1 willful desertion against William W.
â  Dawson and was also granted a divorce.
Mary E. Bornhorst was given a legal
separation from Herman Bornhorst on
the ground of extreme cruelty and was
allowed to resume her maiden name, that

i that might have cost him his
j life. On Friday last, while driving
i over a small trestle near North Berke
ley his horses balked and backed his ve

; then the trace broke and the horses -were

WILLIAM WIEGMAN
SAYS HE WAS BUNKOED
NOW SEEKS TO REGAIN HIS LOST
PROPERTY.
Claims He Signed a Bill of Sale While
Afflicted With a Tem
porary Mania.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, April 3.
William Wiegman filed a suit in the
Superior Court this afternoon against
George E. Beehe and Fred Wiegman, the
latter his cousin, alleging that he was de
frauded out of his interest in a thriving
general merchandise business at Al
varado.
According to his complaint he entered
into a copartnership with Beebe on Jan
uary 2. 1897, Each partner put Into the
business $2500 and the partnership was to
extend over five years. On January 30
of this year Beebe borrowed from Fred
Wiegman $1000, giving him a promissory
note, payable in one year. This money
was also invested In the business. On
February 20 the business was prosperous
and the firm's indebtedness did not ex
ceed JCSO, except the note mentioned,
which plaintiff had also signed, but the
store, stock, fixtures and good will of the
business at this time was worth $SOOO.
About this time, the complaint all* p^s.
plaintiff became very sick, laboring under
temporary mania, and was wholly un
able raid Incompetent to transact any
business, and while in this condition the
.;ints willfully, knowingly and
fraudulently persuaded plaintiff by
threats, menace and force to sign and
execute a certain paper, the purport of
which he did not then understand, but is
now Informed is a bill of sale of all his
rights and interest In the business and as
sets of the firm of Weigman & Beebe to
defendant, his cousin, Mr. Wiegman.
Plaintiff in conclusion alleges that no
consideration was ever paid or agreed
upon, and on February 27 the entire, busi
ness was Bold by defendants to one Har
vey.
Wherefore Mrs. Wiegman asks $10,000
damages on the ground that his business
has been destroyed and his credit and

$500u for punitive damages for the fraud.
Only last week William Wiegman
Fought to have a receiver appointed while
his interests might be determined legally,
but Judge Ogden on that occasion held it
inadvisable to interfere, since he consid

It developed at the hearing of Wlegf
man's petition at that time that his sick

petent to transact business, and for which

Q O
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 3.
The new City Council assumed charge
of the city's affairs to-night. The fea
ture of the meeting was the reading of a
message from Mayor Snow. It was a
pertinent document, words being neither
minced nor wasted.
"We find the city in a pit," says the
Mayor. "We shall hurt somebody getting
it out, and probably do ourselves some
injury; but the peculiar situation is both
the reason for our action and our excuse.
1 recommend that the salary of every of
ficer and employe that is not fixed by the
charter be reduced until June 30 aboift 25
per cent.
"Every incoming Mayor has read an in
augural message; the desk has filed li
away and it has been forgotten within
ten days. You will notice that I have
adopted a different plan. In my communi
cation I have made nine suggestions and
the same number of ordinances and reso
lutions are respectfully presented here
with for such action as your wisdom di
rects.
"To meet the deficit of $60,000, the Coun
cil will probably reduce every salary now
fixed by resolution or ordinance 23 peh
cent. Policemen will probably be retired
from the positions of captain and detec
tives for the purpose of saving their in
creased salaries. The expense of house
numbering will be discontinued. One
half of the street lights are to be shut
off; one-half the street sweeping to be
discontinued and also one-half of the
â  sprinkling. The bond Interest
money due on coupons July 2 will be used
for general expenses; and after all, the
statutory salaries, amounting to $27,000 for
the months of April, May and June, will
have to be carried over into the next tin
cal year.
"It was known when the last tax levy
was made that to do what was then al
proposed would require a levy of
$1 \Ci Without making any change in the
Erogramme of expenses the levy was
\. .1 at $121; deficit of $60,000 Is the re-
"The legal limit of taxation by the city
is $1, ex( ept for bonds and interest. The
assessment mil dropped last year $6,000,
--000 iiinl Is likely to be reduced this year
12 OCmi 000 more. The property of the
whole city Is likely to be valued by the
''ounty Assessor this year for only $40,
--000 000. This valuation at the full l<>gal
rate of taxation will furnish only $400,000.
The additional income from other
sources is not likely to be more than
$350,000, or $750,000 all told.
"The cost for maintenance alone for
the year closing June, 1898, was over $751,
--(kii) The cost of street lighting In IbSJ
was $36,000. It is now $72,000. The cost
of our schools in 1890 was $200,000. It is
now $300,000. In 1890 only $55,000 was ex
pended upon our streets. Last year $80,
--000 was expended for like purposes. Our
Police Department expense has grown
from $48,000 in 1MÂ» to require $78,000 for
maintenance. And our Fire Department
that cost in IS9O $56,000 for maintenance
now costs $82,000. The reduction of
$8 000 000 In the assessment roll since 1897
reduces the Income of the city $80,000 per
year upon a tax rate of $1. The cost of
the city government must be reduced the
coming liscal year $w,OOO or the present
condition of affairs will be repeated one
year from to-day."
To the School Directors Mayor Snow
sent the following additional suggestion:
"1 have one other matter that I desire
to speak of. It is very probable that
some attempt may be made during the
year to amend the city charter. The
present charter attempts to require the
Board of l'ublic Works to act as your
executive arm, while the general law
seems to ret this provision aside. When,
we come to amend the charter It will be
necessary to know for a fact whether
your honorable body controls a school
district and Is subject to the general
laws governing such districts or subject
to charter provisions. I desire to request
that you join if necessary in a friendly
suit that may be hereafter arranged to
determine the legal relation of your hon
orable board to the city of Oakland."
When the Council met Councilman H.
D. Rowe of the Seventh Ward was unani
mously elected president. He waa an ac
tive member of the last Council.
Those who expected surprises at the
Council meeting were not disappointed,
for they came in bunches. Mayor Snow
read his own message and handed In the
ordinances and resolutions necessary to
make it effective.
Councilman (Jirard made the first attack
on gambling by calling up the ordinance
prohibiting keno, which was held up by
the old License Committee. Mr. Glrard
made a powciful plea for the ordinance.
"I hav*e made inquiry," he said "and know
whereof I speak. There are in the heart
of this city twelve or llfteen hells where
our youth are being corrupted and made
dishonest. At this present moment from
500 to 1000 people are gambli^; and ap
purentlv there Is no ordim^T-e to stop
thÂ»m. In this number are clerks and stu
dents of our high school and university,
young men who cannot do more than sup
port themselves, and they are sitting
around risking 1 their money and perhaps
that of their employers at keno. These
bloodsuckers who run these games should
be stopped at once. I know Just where
they are located, and although there are
signs up, 'No boys under 21 admitted,'
that is the most deceptive of subterfuges,
for I have seen in one saloon as many as
eight boys under 16 years old.
If this ordinance will not stand the test
of the courts, then we will pass one im
posing a license of $1000 a night on these
bloodsuckers, and no one can stop us do-
Ing that." As Mr. Girard is chairman of
the License Committee he commands
much authority. The ordinance was unan
imously passed to print.
Another ordinance, introduced by Mayor
Snow, was read and sent to committee. It
prohibits gambling of all kinds, and also
makes it a misdemeanor to lease a place
for gambling.
Measures were also introduced abolish
ing the office of one police captain and of
two detectives; also arranging for doing
away with one-half of the street sweep
ing, sprinkling and street lighting for the
remaining three months of this year;
also for reducing every salary fixed by
the Council and for repealing the ordi
nance appropriating $60,000 for building a
storm sewer In Cemetery Creek. All
these measures will be decided by the
committee of the whole, which will meet
with the Board of Works on Wednesday
evening.
City Clerk Tompklns was reappointed
and he at once named Ed Holand, the
incumbent, as his deputy.
Fred Murdock will cease to be City
Wharfinger on April 30 and Charles W.
Agner was appointed his successor.
Henry Powers will cease to be Pound
master on April 10 and Herbert Swift will
be his successor. John Wilds was ap
pointed to enter upon his twenty-first
year as head janitor of the City Hall. A
resolution was Introduced declaring the
place of Night Janitor Tim Holland va
cant and naming Frank Colver as his
successor, but the matter was sent to
committee.
President Rowe appointed the follow
ing standing committees, the first named

SHE FEARS VISITS
OF HER EX-HUSBAND
E. A. YON SCHMIDT WANTS TO
SEE HIS CHILDREN.
His Ex-Wife Produces Letters He
Has Written Since the Legal
Separation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 3.
Captain E. A. yon Schmidt and his di
vorced wife, Isabella yon Schmidt, ap
peared before Judge Greene to-day and
created a lively scene. The well-known
yachtsman, through his attorney, Hugh
Aldrich, moved the court to modify the
divorce decree recently granted so that
ho might be permitted to occasionally
visit his three children at their Alameda
home. Judge Greene, however, "sat
down" upon the captain pretty hard.
"It's $100 to nothing," said his Honor,
"that If you go to the home of this
woman you would certainly commit some
breach of propriety. No, no, you cannot
go there."
Isabella yon Schmidt held the same
opinion. She was fortified with several
letters she had recently received from
Captain yon Schmidt, wherein he b<
for permission to call at her home and
see the children. In one of these letters
he accused her of having perjured herself
at the divorce trial. Again, while Cap
tain Yon Schmidt was on the witness
stand he tried to convince the court that
he could call at his former wife's home
without committing any breach of pro
priety. Judge Greene, however, decided
that the captain should be allowed to see
his children at some friend's home twice
each month.
Released and Rearrested.
OAKLAND, April 3.â Fred Foster, who
was arrested on a charge of felony em
bezzlement last week in an alleged at
tempt to get away with several race
horses, had his case dismissed in RÂ«.
corder Bradford's court, on the ground of
lack of Jurisdiction, at Emeryville to-day;
but the District Attorney, anticipating
the step, had a new complaint and war
rant issued. Foster was immediately re
arrested and later released on bonds.
Huber's Death Confirmed.
OAKLAND, April 3.â There is now no
doubt that Henry Huber, the Oakland
boy who was with the troops at Manila,
was killed by the Filipinos. Additional
Information has been received in this city
substantiating the story published In The
Call a week ago. The lad's parents have
no longer any hope that their son is still
alive.
Death of Mrs. Samuels.
OAKLAND, April 3.â Mrs. Cecelia Sam
uels, mother of Deputy District Attorney
George Samuels, died to-day at the family
residence, 854% Isabelle street, after a
lingering illness. She was aged 70 years.
UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA NEWS
BERKELEY, April 3.â A determined ef
fort is to be made to arouse the same col
lege spirit and student enthusiasm over
the approaching baseball contest with
Stanford as marked the great football
Beason of last year. The college men have
begun to seÂ« that their baseball players
have, the same support and encourage
ment that helped their gridiron veterans
to the victory of last Thanksgiv4ng. The
same spirit which manifested itself there
is beginning to materialize once more. It
broke out for the first time this afternoon.
Placards announcing a grand baseball
rally had been posted in conspicuous
places in the campus during the day. The
notices brought a throng of students down
to the bleachers on the lower campus
shortly before 4 o'clock. The old-time
feeling was abroad and it showed itself in
the old ways. As Coafh Corbett came on
to the diamond with his men and began
arranging their positions, those on the
bleachers remembered Cochran and hin
f;iants, and the California yell went ring
ng over the field. It was the first time
that the baseball men have been really
cheered this season, but the spell was
broken. Again and again the yell was
given and it came out at intervals during
the practice.
It had the desired effect upon the men
and they put in the snappiest practice of
this term. The same thing will be car
ried out dally, from now on, until the
Blue and Gold faces the Cardinal. Mean
while the enthusiasts are organizing a
rooter's club, similar to that of last term.
Each member has to come to the games
decked in a blue and gold hat. The club
will form the yelling center of the Cali
fornia section at the big games, and will
enliven the proceedings with baaeball
songs and joshes.
The project of a University circus for the
benefit of the Athtletic Association is
gaining favor. It has been found possible
to hold the affair within the enclosure
around the cinder track. The promoters
of the plan have estimated that it will
cost something like $300, and they will lay
this report before the next meeting of
the Athtletic Association. Should it re
colve the sanction of that body the circus
will be held toward the close of the pres
ent term.

A MINING MAN
FIRED UPON BY
AN ASSASSIN
Walter E. Sell Shot at as He Sat
in His Dining Room in East
Berkeley.
The Bloodthirsty Visitor Missed His Mark,
but Made Good His Escape in the
Dark, Leaving Behind a Threat
ening Letter.
WALTER E. BELL, a well-known
mining man. secretary of Charles
D. Lane of the Utica mine, is
practically intrenched in his cot
tage at East Berkeley, fearful every mo
ment of hearing the crack of the revolver
of an unknown assassin. He was made
the target last Friday night for one bui
let and knows not when the next, better
aimed, may find lodgment in his body.
Sell is a man well past 60 years of ape.
};â¢ lives at 221' i Ellsworth street in a
vine-embowerrd cottage, around which
teem to linger nothing but airs of peace.
He is a well-known citizen of the com
munity and, as far as he will say. has
no enemy with a grievance sufficiently
deep to call for bloodshed. With all this
the first bullet has been sped at his life,
and. he fears, the next may reach the
mark. Hr was so prostrated by the shock
he received Friday night that he is a
sick man now. and another attempt of
the fame kind may succeed, even if the
missile flies wider from the mark than
the first.
Sell was sitting in the dining room of
his residence on the night named, talking
with a visitor, whose name cannot be ob
tained. They sat close to the table and
between it and the open window of the
dining-room, which opens into the gar
den at the side. The thought of danger
was not in tho mind of either man, when
they were startled from their Beats by the
loud report of some weapon. A bullet
â whizzed between the head of Sell and
his companion, followed by a puff of
Bmoke and a splintering noise ns the bul
let buried Itself in the woodwork of the
opposite wall above them.
For a moment neither man spoke. They
were both paralyzed from the shock, and

They rushed
Into the hallway and. after a moment,
hearing no further hostile demonstration,
returned to the dining, room, which still ;
smelted r.f the smoke of the would-be

Mr. Bell, who Is tint in thÂ» most robust
of health, was Buffering greatly from the j
nd was compelled to
firop Into a chair, while his friend, a
more vigorous mat I to make
an Investigation.
On the.sill "f the window through which
the slv.t was fired was found a note ad
dressed to "Walter K. Bell." advising him
to have upon his person the sum of $'-W
would meet him and de
mand that amount. The finding of thi*
missive confirmed the suspicion of S< H
and his friend that the shot had been
fired at tli- mining man. whether or not
to kill Is yei an open quei U< a. The loud
r>!'" r '- followed bj the smoke in the
room, Indicated that the bullet had been
sped at short range. The fact, too, that
arden at the side is narrow and the
window high showed that the person who
tired th<- shot had crawled Into the gar
den while Bell and his friend were talk
ing, crept up to the window, left the note
whef> it could t>e found and diÃCharg< d
his weapon point blank.
This last fact, coupled with the leaving
of the r,ot<\ is taken by the detect! 1
whom the case was reported to Indicate
that the shooter meant to scare Sell, not
to kill him. his ultimate object being to
approach the terrified man later and bleed
him for money.
Whoever the man was and whatever h)3
motive, he left no trace behind him but
the noto. A search was made of the
fcarden after the shot had been fired, but
no sign of the unknown visitor could be
found. He had disappeared into the
night.
It was an easy thins for the shooter to
do this, and he probably figured closely
on the effect of his shot on Sell before he
fired it. Several minutes elapsed ere the
friend of the prostrated mining; man got
into the garden, and by that time the un
known miscreant had made his way into
the shadows made fry the trees in that
section of East Berkeley.
The assault was reported soon after Its
occurrence to Marshal Lloyd of Berkeley,
and later in the night he paid a visit to
the scene, but could discover no clew to
the bloodthirsty visitor. Saturday morn
ing Mr. Sell detailed the occurrence to his
attorney, John M. Whitworth. and on his
ced the matter In the hands of
letectlve agency in this city.
Since then Mr. Sell has been practically
barricaded in his home, and nightly suf
fers the most agonizing apprehensions.
He has a male companion constantly with
him, who is very careful to whom he
opens the door.
Mr. Sell's countenance and demeanor
last night betrayed the fact that he was
still suffering from the visit of last Fri
day night. Admittance was only gained
to his home after repeated ringings at
the doorbell, which were answered by a
burly man, who appeared to act as body
guard. ,
Sell seemed greatly perturbed that the
facts should be made public. In his effort
to quiet the affair he asked his caller to
accompany him around the corner, where
his attorney, John M. Whltworth, was
attending a meeting. Preceded by his
bodyguard Sell left the house. Before he
descended the steps he fastened the door
and delayed leaving until his companion
had reached the foot of the stairs. The
latter then lighted a match and by its
flare he narrowly searched the garden, as
if he half expected to rind some one hid
den among the foliage.
Bell was greatly disappointed to find j
that his attorney had left the meeting j
house, as it necessitated his going around
to Mr. Whitworth's home. Despite the.)
fai-t that the latter's house was In dark
ness and that his counsel might hay
tired, Sell boldly walked up the stairs
and loudly rang the bell. While waiting
for an answer to the ring the bodyguard
volunteered the information that he was
with Mr. Seii at the time the shot was
fired. He stated that they were seated
in the dining-room, but refrained from
saying more, as his employer looked
warnlngly at him.
Mr. Whitworth admitted his visitor to
the hallway anil the latter quickly whis
pered the reason for' his untimely visit
and asked his advice. Whitworth stated
that he was surprised that the affair had
pot out, as he know it was only known
to a few. He thought that some impru
dent person bad given out the informa
tion and he seemed to regret it exceed
ingly.
"While I don't object to having the mat
ter given to the world at this time." he
said, "yet I think to publish It now would
defeat the ends of justice. The detectives
are working on the clews that we have in
our possession and are likely to solve the
mystery shortly."
Bell thereupon positively declined to
give his version of the shooting or the
causes that led tip to it. He declared that
if he were to make any statement it
would defeat the efforts of the detectives
who were searching for the would-be
murderer.

This communication was Joyfully re
ceived by the directors present, as it
gave them some assurance that their
claim for recognition and the objects in
view would be fairly considered by their
brothers of the mercantile community,
who are organized for the improvement of
the city.
Secretary Harrison drew the attention
of the directors to the action of the elec

begun in placing electric lamps on thÂ»
street crossings of Mission, Howard. Fol
som and other prominent streets in the
Mission. He informed the directors that
appropriations had been made for this
purpose. hul when Mayor Phelan vetoed
the contract, the electric company with
drew its men from the work. It was the
unanimous expression of the directors
that the work should be continued in
view of tho fact, as stated by Secretary
Harrison, that the money had been ap
propriated for that specific purpose.

Mission Toughs Engage in a Street
Broil Which Ended in Prison.
The sidewalk and a portion of the street
at Nineteenth and J-aptdge was dyed in
crimson and white yesterday afternoon.
This state of affairs was brought about
by throe toughs, who were in company
With as many young women when August
"Harry" and Lawrence Owens drove up
in a milk wagon. To see a man drive a
milk wagonâ or, in fact, perform any
manual laborâ was distasteful to the men
of leisure, so they commenced to guy the
drivers.
The young men in the wagon wouldn't
stand the insults, and as a result there
was a fight in less time than it takes to
tell it. Harry and one of the hoodlums
named Meehan started in to polish each
other's countenance off in the most ap
prove.-] pugilistic fashion. The dairyman
proved to be the better slugger and was
a h< ad" i n his opponent when
Joseph Gallagher and Edward Sullivan,
who were up to this time entertaining
the females, took a hand in the sport.
This brought Owens into the ring to as
sist his companion.
Weapons being scarce he seized a milk
can and struck Meehan over the head,
inflicting a severe scalp wound, whjch
was dressed at the City and County Hos
pital. The noise attracted the attention

General Hubbard Says No Railroad Money
Was Used â Edward F. Searles Ar
rives After a Long
Absence.
y^-NENERAL THOMAS H. HTJBBARD, vice president of the
In Southern Pacific Company, confiims the statement of President
Collis P. Huntington that W. F. Herrin's support of the can
didacy of Dan Burns for United States Senator was without the
sanction of the Southern Pacific Company. On being interviewed
regarding the matter General Hubbard said:
"I don't think Southern Pacific influence was used in the Sen
atorial fight in California. I know no money was used, ana I don't
think any influence was used by that company. The matter was
talked over long ago, and we decided we would do nothing for
Mr. Burns. It was decided to let him make his own campaign.
"I have read of the conference between John D. Spreckels of
The Call, M. H. de Young of the Chronicle t.nd Mr. Herrin. during
which the latter stated his preference for Mr. Burns as> a Senator
ial candilata. I suppose that Mr. Herrin was expressing his in
dividual preference. He was not representing the company. I don't
consider that we have atay right .o : . + erf ere in the politics of Cali
fornia or any other State. My dea is that the company should keep
out of politics, except in case of self-defense. It has the same right
to defend itself that an individual has. I wish they had elected a
Senator. It is a pity and unfortunate that California should be rep
resented by only one Senator f the next two years."
General Huhbard arrived from Now
York yesterday afternoon on a Bpeclal
train, accompanied by Edward 1". Searles,
whose interests he represents in the
Southern Pacific Company; I "avid K.
Rruce, a friend of Mi. Searles, and E. E.

party has taken up quarters at the J'al

SHAFTER TELLS AGAIN
OF TORRAL'S SURRENDER
PRESBYTERIANS GIVE HIM A
ROYAL WELCOME.
A Brilliant Programme Is Rendered
at the Van Ness Avenue
Church.
General Rhafter was obliged tr> tell j
again last evening the tale of his victory
at Santiago, and although since it all i
happened he has told it times without
number ho has become none the better
speaker. He gave hia hearers simply the
plain unvarnished tale of how it all hap
pened.
This latest recital of the story of the
brave siege of Santiago and of Torals
surrender was occasioned by a reception
tendered the general last evening by the
congregation of the First. Presbyterian
Church, at the corner of Sacramento
street and Van Ness avenue. It was an
interesting story General Shatter told his
half a thousand hearers and interest In ;
what he had to say did not wane from
the first to the end of the three-quarters
of an hour it took to tell it.
The general, however, did not provide
all of the evening's entertainment There
was an excellently arranged programme
and s.'iiv good music to lend variety, be
sides the other concomitants of a hospita
ble evening and every one had a splendid
time and an opportunity to meet the San
tiago hero.
The evening's programme, which was
arranged and directed by Mrs. YV. B.
Harrington, was as follows:

cilltate the reorganization of the Central
Pacific, but was not necessary to it.
Nothing, s<> far as he knew, had been
said by the directors in reference to con-
Bolidating the other leased lines of the
m Pacific Company.
T. S. Stillman, his former law partner
present colleague on the Southern Pa
cific directorate, as a representative of the
ea Interest, has given up all active
connection, he said, with the affairs of the
Southern Pacific Company. This does not
!.â  i essarily mean, he added, that Stillman
would be superseded by some other per
son on the directorate of that company.
If.' had not heard the matter discussed,
but had seen publications In the papers,
in which the names of Horace <â . Platt
and Prince Poniatowski had heen men
tloned. General Hubbard had not talked
ticket with any of the other directors, nor
had the situation been canvassed. No
changes were likely to be made in the
offices or directorate of the company,
with the possible exception of electing a
new director to take the place of Still
man. He had not heard Mr. Bearles* name
mi utioned in that connection.
General Hubbard and Mr. Searles ex
pect to remain in California two or three
weeks. Mr. Searles has not been here for
about six years. He came o n the invita
tion of General Hubbard. and his visit is
said to have no particular significance in
connection with Southern I'aciiic affairs.

Witii Warm Shampoos
and light dressings of CUTICURA, purest of
emollient skin cures. This treatment at once
stops falling hair, removes crusts, scales and
dandruff, soothes irritated, itching surfaces,
stimulates the hair follicles, supplies the roots
with energy and nourishment, and makes the
hair grow. upon a sweet, wholesome, healthy
scalp when all else fails.
My scalp became full of white dandruff. It formed into a kind of crust
which, when scratched, would become irritated and bleed , then a crust would
form where it had been scratched. It itched so that I thought it would drive me
crazy, and I was ashamed to be in company. I had read a- great deal about
CUTICURA, and finally concluded to try it. I cannot express to you in words
the relief and happiness which I received upon the first few trials. Before retiring
I would wash my head thoroughly with CUTICURA SOAP and then take a fine
tooth comb and comb my hair very gently. " It seemed as though the CUTICURA
Ointment moistened the hard crust, and it came out in the fine teeth of the comb
in big scales and chunks. Then I washed my head again with CUTICURA
SOAP, rubbing the Ointment into the scalp, and when I awoke in the following
morning I felt like new. I have thick. luxuriant hair now since using the
CUTICURA treatment, and lam very proud of it I value your remedies verj-
highly and recommend them to all.

The differences between the police and

The date agreed upon was accepted by

jockey t'lub is not a law-respecting cor
poration ttvn the club can have no relief

lice can establish thr contention that the

in consequence will win thr action.
