VOLUME LXXXVâ NO. 153.
THE first "Dewey Day," the infant
anniversary of one of the greatest
naval battles of ancient or modern
times, the tribute of a people to its
hero, -was indelibly marked yesterday on
the nation's calendar by the citizens of
California. The prayers of patriotism
swept over the heartstrings of a grate
ful populace to swell a pean of praise to
th*- greatest American, to the Man of
Manila Bay, to Admiral George Dewey,
the foremost son of rbekribbed Ver
mont, the most formidable bulwark of
the grandest commonwealth on earth.
From Siskiyou to San Diego, through
out the width of the Golden State, in
every city, town and hamlet, the whole
people rose, lining their voices with
their sounding heartbeats to send the
music of their souls in joyous volume
across the sea to mingle eternally with
the endlessly reverberating bass of
Dewey's booming guns. From the tops
of the highest peaks to the tips of the
staves on the lowliest schoolhouses;
from the dwellings of the humblest citi
zens, from the tallest skyscrapers, from
public buildings, from ranch and farm
houses, on : "his and steeples, from
railroad trains streaming to their des
tinations, from endless masts in every
harbor, the stars and stripes, the flag
of all flags, fluttered to the gentle
breeze that seemed to enter Into the
spirit of the day to float the standard
of the nation to the sunshine of Cali
fornia In salute to Dewey.
Cannon boomed from the forts and
warships, music swelled from a thou
sand parks, bells rang throughout day
and bonfires burned and rockets soared
at night. Orators lent their voices in
eulogy to the one man that needed it |
not, and great crowds cheered their
words to the echo. No such celebration
has ever been observed ln any country
at any time. It was spontaneous, the
result of grateful impulse, an outpour- j
ing of the popular heart, the thrusting j
or a mighty handgrasp across the sea,
to the man on the bridge of the Olym- 'â¢
pia.
In this city, where the idea was or
iginated, the first Dewey Day celebra
tion ill hardly be bettered â not unless
on the next the man himself is here,
â which is not so improbable. Everybody
did his level best to make of the anni
versary one never to be forgotten, and
the result was beyond all expectations,
To begin with, business houses, almost
without exception, did not open their
doors; the wheels in no factories re
volved; the hands of few men labored,
and then only that the common object,
the success of the celebration, should be
to the full. Musicians tooted and blew
and drummed; gripmen clanged their
bells and conductors took the fares of
the crowds headed ror the various
pleasure resorts; caterers fed the pleas
ure seekers, waiters put them in the
way of quenching thirst induced by the
patriotic fires within; street fakers
drove thriving trades in flags and flow
ers and Dewey buttons. Men. women
and children were out in their summer j
finery, transportation lines were crowd
ed, places of amusement were thronged,
steamboats were jammed with picnick
ers and all went merry, as should have
gone such a doubly glorious day in
May.
The celebration was begun almost as
early as the battle which it commem
orated. Almost at the flrst streak of ;
dawn the popping of firecrackers gave
notice that the young patriots of San
Francisco were wide awaae to the pos
sibilities of the day ahead. Their
parents and bigger brothers and sisters
arose later, but also to the occasion. In
the thousands upon thousands of homes |
in the peninsula and, fortified with I
breakfast, sallied forth to loin the
crowds headed for the depots, the fer
ries and the parks, to testify in his or
her joy the love they bore to the man
who had made of a Spanish menace a
memory of the Pacific. Flowers
bloomed on every coat, smiles spread on
every cheek, cheers lurked on every lip.
There was music in the air, and sum
mery balm and sunshine and gladness,
with flags flying endlessly above and
patriotism burning ceaselessly beneath.
And tha,t was only the beginning. The
early crowds poured Into railway
trains, street- cars, 'buses and steam
boats, headed in all directions, but to
no perceptible extent did the holiday
throngs seem to diminish. On through
the day they passed and repassed on
the streets and in the public resorts to
rejoin at night those other throngs who
had sought the roomy country to give
expression to the feeling pent up for a
year past. * ]y - 7 - â¢
The greatest of - these out-of-town '
throngs was that which accompanied
the Native Sons of Vermont to Sunset
Park in the Santa Cruz, Mountains. To
that organization in this city is due the
credit for the newest and what will
run the Fourth of July close as the
most popular holiday in .America As
a son of the Green Mountain State they
agitated the propriety of doing honor
to the hero of Manila by setting apart
to his memory the day of his great
victory. They decided to honor his
achievement on the first of May, which
they dabbed Dewey day, and they
asked the other Citizens Of California
to join with them on the occasion. The
idea took like wildfire and, while the
Legislature was too busily engaged in â 
the throes of a Senatorial battle to set
it upon the statute books as a legal
holiday, th*- sentiment in favor of
Dewey day grew so rapidly that the
Governor of the State and the Mayor
of San Francisco remedied the omission
at the Legislature and made it one.
The San Francisco Call.
The people of California did the rest. I
As a result of their love labors to j
honor a son of their State and the ad- I
miral of all the States, the Vermonters
were almost unable to carry the crowds
that wished to participate In the cele- j
' bration at Sunset Park. The members j
of the society, headed by the Golden I
Gate Park band, marched to the ferry
and onto the boats at the ferry at 8:45
o'clock, followed by the merriest throng
of patriots of both sexes and all ages
and headed across the stream for the
gayly caparisoned cars that were to |
take them to the mountains, where the
eagle bird could scream to his heart's
content. They went and they cele
brated, with everything to make and j
nothing to mar the success of the out- j
ing.
Others who could not go with the
Vermonters remained behind to find
other scenes to animate by their pres- !
ence and make glad with their voices, i
The city squares. Golden Gate Park
and the beach were alive with sight- j
seers and pleasure seekers all the live- i
long, vibrant, sunshiny day. At the I
suburban places of amusement con
stant streams of people poured in to j
: listen to Dewey day tings and stir i
up the animals.
And out on that other city, on the
ships in the bay. under their forests
of masts, they celebrated too. Excur
sion parties on gayly decorated tugs
and launches flew back and forth among
the vessels of commerce and of war,
cheering the bunting alow and aloft,
cheering the holiday dresses donned by
the British ships for the occasion,
cheering the lowa and the Marion and
the Pensacola and fairly shrieking with
delight at the salutes to the absent
Dewey from his brethren aboard.
And on the Grant and Sherman, the !
transports just returned from Manila,
Dewey day was celebrated none .he
less fittingly if more quietly.^ In the
sick bays of both ships, were men down
with disease, disabled by wounds, Who
had lately breathed the same air with â 
j the admiral of all their country's fleets,
and they were only too eager to lend ]
| their patriotism to the celebration.
They could not dance or shout or sing,
but they could feel the blood rush
through their arteries at memory of
their hero as it rushed in the days
when they fought near Manila under
his protecting aegis. "They also serve
who only stand and wait."
Two .other pretty features of the
memorable day consisted in the firing
lof an admiral's salute in Columbia
Square from a Spanish cannon cap
tured at Cavite* It is supposed to be
the ward g that barked first at the ap
proach of Dewey. It barked joyfully
yesterday in his honor at the behest ol
American tars and thousands heard the
. message At Golden Gate Park the
flag of the McCulloch, which was
Dewey's dispatch boat, was floated to
the breeze from a staff.
And, fitting ending of the day. when
most of the merrymakers had found
their beds and their homes, a great '
beacon fire still blazed on Twin Peaks,
throwing its glow far out on the Pa- |
cific, as if to signal Dewey, "Steer this
way, admiral,. San Francisco wants I
you."
VERMONTERS AT
SUNSET PARK
Nearly 10,000 residents of this cltt
and adjoining towns journeyed to Sun
set Park yesterday to participate in the
grand celebration given by the Native
Sons of Vermont, who had originated
the idea, in commemoration of Ad
miral Dewey's great victory. Three
long trains carried the pleasure-seeker's
from the Oakland mole to the gardens
of the Santa Cruz Mountains. A pleas
ing feature of the . celebration was the
fact that the hoodlum element was
missing. There was, therefore, prac
tically no need of the squad of police
men which accompanied the picnickers.
The latter were a joyous lit of patriots
on pleasure bent, who gave vent to
their enthusiasm at. the proper times.
Promptly at 8:45 a. m. the three
trains left the mole and started for tin
mountains. At noon the picnic grounds i
were reached and the exercises of the
day were inaugurated. After the
Golden Gate Park band had rendered a
few national airs Rev. George C.
Adams arose from his seat on the Plat
form and delivered the invocation.
Hon. Edward A. Belcher, president of
th*- day, then made his opening re
marks.- His speech was short and was
delivered with great force. During its.
delivery the speaker was often inter
rupted with bursts of hearty applause.
He said: ' yy
Fellow Citizens: Early in our history
the old Green Mountain State gave to
the country its ideal soldierâ no sum
mons to surrender was ever more im
perative than that of Ethan Allen at
Ticonderoga and lately she has given
to the country its ideal sailor. His
tory contains the record of no sea fight
so splendid and so overwhelmingly vic
torious as that of Dewey at Manila;
Proud is the mother Stale of her
sons! None more steadfast in their
patriotism; none braver in the front
of the batle!
The narration of deeds of valor of
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1899.
THE
NATION
PROUDLY
HONORS HER
FAVORITE SON.
Itself inspires courage even in timid
hearts, and the preservation of the
memory of great days in the life of a
nation tends to keep the .fires of pa
triotism continually glowing. This
truth has ben recognized by the set
ting apart for patriotic purposes: of
such days as Washington's birthday,
Memorial day and th.- Fourth of July.
Not since the Civil War has any event
exercised so powerful an influence in
American history as Admiral Dewey's
decisive victory over the Spanish fleet
on Mayday of last year. Mayday, al
ways a day of festival, thenceforth
contained for us a new meaning On
that day the prestige of American
arms, ions while fallen into disrepute
among the nation was restored
by th.- great admiral to â¢ its
pristine glory, never again to be abat
ed or diminished: and on' that day he
gave to the American people a splen
did Eastern empire, the marvelous
possibilities of which we cannot at
this time even dimly comprehend.
To rename the day thus. made so mo
mentous to us and 'place it in the cal
endar of days to be especially remem
bered and observed by patriots was
both graceful and appropriate. That
honor belongs to the Pacific Coast As
sociation of the Native Sons of Ver
mont at San Francisco. That associa
tion was the first to designate the an
niversary of the battle of Manila Bay
as Dewey day, and that designation â 
has been accepted everywhere In the
land. As Dewey day, then, the recur
ring anniversary of the great admiral's
glorious achievement for American
arms will go ringing down the grooves
of history, lighting the ages with its
glow, quickening the pulses of mil
lions of Americans yet unborn as they
listen to that thrilling story of daring
and intrepidity and stimulating the
hearts of the brave and refreshing
patriotism down -to that remotest
period of time when there shall be.no
more wars or rumors of wars among
the nations.
In concluding these brief opening re- 7
marks, 1 ask you â  to join mc in three
rousing cheers for Admiral Dewey.
At the conclusion 'of his address
Judge Belcher introduced Miss L. C.
Snider, who sang the national anthem.
Hon. M. M. Estee. the orator: of -the
day, received a hearty greeting '.when
introduced to his audience. His speech
was punctuated with applause and
cheers. He said in part:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentle
men: The sous of Vermont have met
to-day to celebrate the first anniver
sary of an event famous in American
history. They have selected Dewey
as the most Illustrious Vermonter by
making "May day" a. "Dewey day." I
venture to remind you, however,: that
Admiral Dewey belongs to the Amer
lean nation, not to any one State.
Vermont can no more claim Dewey as
hers than can Virginia claim, Wash
ington, or Illinois Lincoln and Grant.
Dewey fought tor his country, won tor
his country, and he belongs to he
whole country. He had to be born
somewhere, and he is not to blame tor
being horn in Vermont, it Is a good
State to be born in. ~
Dewey made himself famous not
alone because he destroyed the Span
ish fleet, but rather by the way he did
it. He fearlessly attacked the com
bined land and naval forces of Spain,
and. after silencing on.-, he destroyed
the other. It was his audacity of at
tack." his wisdom In action, his rapid
ity and accuracy of movement, and
above all. the personal bravery of
himself, his officers and his men which
stamp this naval battle among the
great achievements ol this time and
Possibly of all time. With European
people there was a doubt about the
efficiency of our navy. It had been
referred to as "good to look at,", and
our officers and men as "fine speci
mens to display uniforms on!" But
Dewey's victory settled this question
at the very beginning of the Spanish
war and the world found out what
American sailors were for.
Events which this generation did not
control led up to this war. Since the
dawn of the world's history civiliza
tion has moved westward. During the
fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth cen
turies Spain held* undisputed dominion
over the western world, but in this
and the preceding century the Anglo-
Saxons have pushed Spain and all
other peoples aside and the Anglo-
Saxon race now dominates the West
ern Hemisphere. This splendid race of
men has everywhere carried civiliza
tion Into barbarous countries, it has
discovered unknown lands and crowd
ed the seas with new and more effec
tive messengers ' of commerce, and
thus the white man's destiny has been,
one of progress and of expansion. No
man and no political party or national
administration is. or. has been, forcible
enough to stop man's westward march
to empire.
Our present expansion la not a new
principle in American policy, for from
the beginning we have taught it. At
first we did not go beyond the conti
nentâthere was no need for itâ there
.was most ample undeveloped 1 terri
tory at home. : The greatest and one of
the wisest expansionists America ever
produced- was that most conservative
statesmanâ Thomas Jefferson. â  He got
more good American territory for less
money than was - ever obtained .by
America before or since then, lie
knew, as every statesman must know,
that that .nation will -grow fastest
which offers to ? the world the 7 best
government and the greatest amount
of good . unoccupied land. He knew
that -every â¢ step â¢ toward- expansion
__j__aÂ»ss?-as_SÂ«_y_--. -. - i-Â«Â»___n_l
meant. prosperity to the American na
tion. 11.- knew it meant the advance
ment of civilization, and that Amer
ica must either expand or be absorbed
by ' nations which do expand. He
knew that the- white - man's burden
was to multiply, replenish, subdue and
civilise the earth; that to do that we
must have a goodly portion of it to
work upon; that a great and free peo
ple cannot stand stillâ that when it
does it will die.
We will have trouble with the Phil
ippines, but our trouble in subduing
tie Filipinos Is not a new experience
for Americans. During the whole of
.our national existence we have been
'fighting barbarous peoples. We com
menced with th.- American Indians.
â¢ and it was war. and not the mild an.l
' persuasive Influence of Christian civil
ization that defeated them. So the
present situation- is nothing new to
American soldiery- It is true we are
now lighting another race, but we
have been lighting a worse and more
dangerous one. It matters not whether*
th.- one proves less troublesome than
th*' other, for neither the Indians nor
th.- Filipinos have proven themselves
tit for self-government, and so we pro
pose to do the next best thing with
themâ lmprove their country and civil
ize their people. We would have had
no- war with the Filipinos if dissat
isfied Americans had not sought to
make the Filipinos believe that â  we
were bent on their oppression, and it
is my conviction that the death of
every American soldier in this war
will be due more to those Americans
who remain at home in safety and de
nounce the present American policy
than to the Filipinos who. lay in. am
bush ready, to attack our. men. The
so-called anti-imperialists of our coun
try are fast developing Into the ene
mies |of our country.
The trouble with most of the com
plaining Americans is that they. do not
understand thai the United States has
grown to be â  .first-class - power; that
this nation has discarded short school
dresses and now dons her best clothes
and her longest train; that commer
cially we are competing with all other
peoples; that financially we borrow
from each other; that socially a dollar
banquet is infinitely more popular and
quite as good for indigestion as a ten
dollar banquet, and -yet we are the
richest people on the earth and have
money enough for either banquet; that
we. I have grown beyond our youthful
restraints, and are now living up to
the spirit of progress: which has long
inspired our people; that when we
were young in years and small in stat
ure no other nation- was jealous of us,
but now we are In the way we not
only make a noise, but fill a large
space In the world, and so when some
of our people complain about our mak
ing haste too fast, they find plenty of
echoes coming. back to them from our
jealous neighbors. .........
But you can no more stop American I
progress or stay the patriotic enthusi
asm of the young American soldiers J
than you can stop athletic sports in
American colleges, stay American ex-'
pansion or smother the glorious enthu
siasm of American patriotism. The
present situation is not one that can
be changed by party discipline. In this
mutter, paraphrasing what the negro
astronomer said about th*- sun, "The j
American people do move," and when j
they move the camp followers better j
hurry up or they will be left behind.
For the first time in American his
tory the whole civilized world has
been a spectator to American valor.
We have proven that it was the men
behind the gun that won the victories
and we must now prove that it is the
man in the less glorious pursuits of
peace that will win the victory.
This war with Spain has accom
plished another great purpose for this
republic; it has reunited the American
people. It has obliterated all feeling
of unrest between the North and the â 
South, and for the first time since the
Rebellion all Americans are for Amer
ica. American patriotism has received
new inspiration; the love of country
has grown as the war progressed: the
young men have been educated to
obey as well as to command: the war
power of the American navy has been
demonstrated, and thus the experi
ence of this war has prepared us to
meet any exigency which peace or
war may impose upon us.
The Philippine policy, now adopted,
affords no room for retreat. We must
accept what the war with Spain gave
us and not fall back upon real or an
ticipated dangers. We have bought
these islands and paid for them, when
we could have got them by conquest.
And while we admit that all men are
entitled to justice, yet the men who
make cruel .and barbarous war upon '
the American people must be-sub*.
dued. Political equality and justice
are. not synonymous terms. For in
stance, the people of the Territories of
the United States have never been the
political equals of the citizens of the
States. . The inhabitants of the. District
of 'Columbia cannot' vote for their
public officers, and yet they are Ameri
. cap citizens. We have long since set
tled the question that as to the Terri
tories of our country Congress can
regulate their internal affairs, as we
did with polygamy in Utah, anil it is
- a part of American sovereignty to
- maintain peace everywhere on Ameri
. can soil.
Coming events cast their shadows
before; these shadows are approach
ing, It was recently said by an
American statesman that the life and
glory of this nation may soon be put
to the test. We hope not. But noth
ing â¢ can stop American expansion
without national destruction, and this
great republic will not be destroyed
, while American honor and American
patriotism endure. -*
Rhys Thomas followed with a patri
otic song and then the band struck up
that appropriate march, "When Dewey
Comes Marching Home." When the
applause had subsided the audience, led
by A. O. Perkins and others on the plat
form, sang "America;"
At the conclusion < i the programme
the picnickers spread themselves over
the grounds and enjoyed themselves as
only picnickers can. An hour later the
park band signaled that the dance was
on and many merry couples mingled in
the dance, which continued during the
afternoon, and those who found the
pavilion crowded enjoyed the games.
The games created considerable ex
citement among the young and old.
A. O. Colton, A. O. Perkins, Mrs. L.
J. Hardy and A. E. Lucas composed
the committee under whose direction
they were conducted. The races and

At 5:30 o'clock the three big trains
started on the homeward journey, and
a tired but -contented crowd left the
ferry to divide and await the coming
of another "Dewey Day."
VESSELS GAY
WITH BUNTING
Never in the history of the water front
has there been so much bunting displayed
as was thrown yesterday to the north
west breeze. _ Every craft on the bay was
decorated, and while some made a better
showing than others, there was not one
that did not fly her flag in honor of
Dewey day. The British fleet made a
splendid showing, every ship being
dressed for the occasion. The lowa. Pen
sacola and Marion were gay with bunt
ing and each fired an admiral's salute
during the day.
The training ship Pensacola lying off
Goat Island w as the first to salute. At 8
a. m. the apprentice boys were paraded
on deck. The ship was then dressed, the
admiral's flag run up and the salute fired.
At noon the reserve boys on the Marion
manned the rapid fire battery and a few
seconds before the time ball fell she also
was saluting in honor of Dewey. The
lowa took up the refrain and for a few
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
minutes the shores of Alameda and Ma
rin re-echoed the cannonading. The bat
tleship was decorated in a most appro
priate manner, her fighting masts and up
per structure being covered with bunt
ing. During the afternoon, when it began
to blow very hard, the Pensacola took in
her flags, but all the other vessels in port
kept them flying until sundown.
Among the merchantmen the best show
ing was made by the brig Courtney Ford.
This was due more to her position, how
ever, than anything else. She was on the
California drydock and towered away
above the other ships at the wharves.
Captain Murchison had secured an extra
supply of signal flags and had his vessel
covered with bunting. At Howard street
wharf the British ships Zinita and King
George and the American barkentine
Ruth were gay with color. .
The tugs Fearless and Relief made a
brave showing, while the Vigilant was
covered with bunting. The Vigilant made
hourly trips between the Pensacola and
Pacific street wharf, carrying visitors to
the apprentice boys on the training ship.
The launches Amy and William D car
ried visitors to the lowa, and Henry Pe
terson saw to it that his boats did honor
to the nation's hero.
At Lombard street wharf the British
steamer Athenian and at Pacific street
wharf the American steamer Australia
: vied with each other as to which would
make the best display. Both steamers
are rushing the work of loading and un
loading in order to get away on time, so
the crews did not get any holiday, but
the men had the consolation of knowing
that they were earning double pay and
at the same time working under the fin
est display of bunting ever seen on either
ship.
Over at Oakland the Hawaiian bark
Roderick Dhu held the pride of place.
Captain Johnson saw to it that there was
a good supply of extra flags aboard and
superintended the dressing of his ship.
The Hawaiian bark Willscott, the Ameri
can schooners Robert Searles and Muriel
.helped to make Oakland Long Wharf look
its gayest, while, away up in Oakland
Creek the British ships Flintshire. Afon
Alaw and Brussels did honor to the oc
casion. Captains Thomas of the Afon
Alaw and Jones of the Flintshire take al
most as much Interest in California as the
Native Sons, and whenever their vessels
, are in port on a national holiday a fine
display of bunting can be depended upon
; fro mthem.
Over at Sausalito are the British ships
Ben Lee. Centesima and Crown of India;
at Martinez is the British ship Zalus. at
Port Costa are the American schooner
Albert Meyer, Italian ship Catering Ac
came - and British ship Primrose Hill,
while out in the bay is a fleet of sugar
boats, every one of which had all Its
flags set. At Mission street lies the Rus
sian barkentine Bering, and at the Mail
dock the Japanese steamer America
Maru. both of which made as good a
showing as the American vessels. Thus
American. British, Italian. Russian and
Japanese vessels combined to do honor
to Dewey, the hero of Manila, and suc
ceeded in making one of the most nota
ble displays ever seen on the front.
FLAG RAISING
IN THE PARK
Fully 30,000 people celebrated Dewey day
in Golden Gate Park. Captain Thompson,
chief of the park police, declared that,
considering the wind that was disagree
able in the extreme, the crowd was one of
the largest on record. The wind blew a
gale, and the dust from the roadways and
footpaths blew in blinding clouds, but the
crowd did not care. It was out for fun
and incidentally to honor the hero of Ma
nila Bay by having as much personal
pleasure as possible.
The feature of th*- day in the park was
the raising of the flag recently presented
to the park by the crew of the McCulloch.
This was done at the music stand by the
police of the park under the direction of
Superintendent John McLaren. As tho
beautiful folds of Old Glory were caught
and tossed by the breeze, the band played
"The Star Spangled Banner." the crowd
sent up a mighty volume of cheers, and
there was a prolonged cheering when
some one proposed three cheers for Ad
miral Dewey. The pole from which the
new flag was raised was not tall enough
to serve its purpose, and whenever the
wind died down Its beautiful folds reached
to and dragged upon the ground.
The flag was raised at 2 o'clock. After
the band had played "The Star Spangled
Banner." it rendered its usual concert.
Yesterday the programme In honor of the
occasion was particularly elaborate and
contained several extra numbers. It was
as. follows:
Introductory march, "When Dewey Comes
Home" (Lee Johnson): grand American over
ture, arranged by Catlinâ Contents: "Red.
White and Blue." "The Land of Washington."
"America." "Star-Spangled Banner," "Yan
kee Doodle"; popular songs with xylophone
solo (Breham); selection, "Robin Hood" (De
Koven); "Sword of Bunker Hill" tColvert);
Intermezzo, "Cavallera Rustlcana" (Mascag
ni); "Musical Toun" (Conradt); "Tone Pic
tures of the North and South" (Bendix); se
lection ' from "11 Trovatore" (Verdi); waltz,
"Jolly Fellows" (Volstedt); descriptive "Ckv
alry Charge" (Lueders); march, "Dewey's
Victory" (Lee Johnson). ; ; "
The music stand was not the only center
of attraction for the great crowd. The
children's playground was simply crowded
with little ones, who made the day a gala
occasion. Fully 10,000 people . visited (the
museum,' while the conservatory .and- the
other various places of interest were 'vis
ited by thousands. The crowd began to
wend Its way homeward shortly after 4
o'clock, and two hours' later the park was
almost entirely deserted. There were no
runaways and only .one serious accident
was reported during the day. Two lost
children were also reported at the police
station, -but they were subsequen_.y found.
THE COLUMBIA
SQUARE SALUTE
A salute to Dewey from an enemy's gun
and a concert by the Second Regiment
Band were the magnets that drew thou
sands yesterday to Columbia square, one
of the city's prettiest breathing spots, be
tween Folsom and Harrison and Sixth and
â¢Seventh streets.
The gun is a brass 5-pounder, muzzle
loading, and bears the arms of vanquished
Spain. From its muzzle is supposed to
have issued forth the first shot at Dewey's
fleet as it steamed past Corregidor Island
on that fateful Ist of May to deal destruc
tion to the Spanish fleet. The shell it
threw passed between the flagship and
the cruiser Baltimore. By reason of the
fact that this cannon gave the signal for
the battle which followed its position was
marked, and when the American com
mander took possesssion of Corregidor he
singled out this gun ami sent it to Amer
ica to the committee having in charge the
erection of a monument to the sailors of
the Maine.
The cannon was placed a little to the
west of the center of the square, with a
cordon of police miner Lieutenant Nash
and Sergeants Coogan and Conboy to hold
1 the crowd in check. Little Viola Cheva-2
Her, a New York miss of 7. who had been
chosen as mascot, mounted the gun as an
Introductory step, amid the applause of j
old and young. Then at the stroke of 12
the first shot of the admiral's salute was !
fired, the sixteen others following in the
prescribed succession, a pound and a half
of powder to the charge.
Immediately after the salute Police Ser
geant Donovan picked up a copper com
pass fully a foot in length and unusually
thick and heavy about 100 feet from the
gun. The compass was still warm, show- j
ing that it had been Bred from the piece.
Captain Spillane says the compass was
undoubtedly In the gun when it was load- i
ed yesterday; and blames the gunners for
not inspecting the gun more carefully, as
a serious accident might have resulted, j
The compass is now tit the southern sta
tion. Captain Spillane thinks it waa
placed In the weapon by some Spanish
gunner during the battle of Manila when
ammuntion had become exhausted.
The men in charge of the salute were
Owen Hill; chief gunner's mate; E. J.
Hurke. lirst class gunner's mate; Joseph j
Delhilde. first class gunner's mate, all of
the battleship lowa, and John Brady, an
attache of the Mare Island yard, who saw
to the tiring.
After the salute the band held the crowd i
with patriotic and popular airs for two j
hours.

BIG CROWDS
AT GLEN PARK
Thousands celebrated Dewey day at
Glen Park. The management of the
pleasure grounds generously placed the
park, free of all charge, at the disposal
of the people, and happy picnic parties
spread themselves all over the place.
In the morning more than 5000 happy
children, all scholars in the public

parents and friends what George S.
Miehllng, professor of physical training
in the public schools, had done for them.
Twenty-one schools were represented
Professor Miehllng put the children
through the "setting up exercises" in
vogue in the United States army. The
graceful movements of the little ones as
they moved and swayed in their calls
thenic-exercises made a pretty and In
structive picture. Many members of the
School Board were present and expressed
themselves as delighted with the work of
the pupils.
Boys and girls stood in line side by side.
Â«and no ex distinction was made "in the
exercises. The marching was especially
fine, and the lot line of children, march
ing four abreast, was particularly im
posing. The exercises began at 10 o'clock
and were concluded shortly before noon.
In the afternoon an excellent pro
gramme of music, song and dance was
presented in the pavilion. Besides the
fun In the "Barn," the visitors found the
swings, the Bee-saws, the zoo and the
donkeys all at their disposal.
The wind blew fust and furious, whist

cheers that rent the air in honor of the

A DEWEY EVE
AT THE FAIR
It was Dewey Eve at the Catholic La
dies' Aid bazaar, and the crowd that was
present last night taxed the capacity of
the Native Sons' Hall. The stage had
been appropriately decorated with flags
and bunting and there was an air of pa
triotism around all the booths, which
were also decorated with the national col
ors. .lev's band furnished the music,
and as each patriotic selection was ren
dered it was greeted with cheers. There
was plenty of light and color and the
scene presented at the bazaar last night
was stirring and not likely to be forgot
ten soon by any one present. The bail
opened the musical programme with a pa
triotic selection. Next came the Ukulele
quintet This excellent musical organiza
tion Is composed of Misses Howard,
Leale Mills, Kathleen and Constance de
Young. The quintet was followed by Mr.
Morrissey, who created much amusement
by his comical recitations. Mrs. Fitzsim
mons rendered a harp solo, and James
Gulldea sang "The California \olunteer,
which was warmly received. Gulldea was
in the full uniform of an American sol
dier, which added much to the realism of
the song. ... , <â 
There was the usually large number of
pretty girls In attendance at the bazaar,
and no one was allowed to escape tue 10
and 25 cent chances at everything in
sight Many of the beautiful and useful
articles for sale at the various booths
were disposed of, greatly to the satisfac
tion of the lady managers of the bazaar.
Everybody was in a generous mood, and
the auctioneers obtained good prices tor
all the wares they sold The various vot
ing contests progressed briskly, and the
promoters of the bazaar are confident
that It will be a great financial success.
The lunch room had a most profitable
day and, in fact, as the ladles expressed
it," they wished that every day was a
Dewey Day.
A Point Lobos Social.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club
celebrated Dewey day by a grand social
and ball last night at Richmond Hall.
Everybody In the district was there and
the hall was filled to its utmost capacity.
Many persons were turned away, being
unable to find even standing room. The
entertainment was a complete success
and reflects great credit upon the commit
tee of the club that had it in charge. A
well selected and varied programme was
arranged for the evening's entertainment,
which consisted of songs, reading, spe
cialties and other features. The pro
gramme was prefaced by a few remarks
from D L. Fitzgerald, who spoke of the
significance of the day and what it
meant to American history.
Those who contributed to the pro
gramme were: James Vincent and Miss
Ella Fletcher. G. T. Balch, Miss Lottie J.
Graeber, Miss Alice Vincent. Master Fay

celebrated Dewey day by a high jinks last
night on the Marion. There was a large

and a collation which was served to th.
largo number Of friends of the jackies.
Battle of Manila Bay.
Several thousand admirers of America's
great naval hero. visited the panorama of
the battle of Manila Bay at Central Park
yesterday to view the lifelike presenta
tion of the destruction of the Spanish
fleet by the vessels under the command of
the Immortal Dewey Just a year ago, the
r.ews of which electrified the world and
marked the beginning of a new epoch in
the history of the United States. The re
markable fidelity with which the memor
able engagement off Cavite Is depicted la
a subject of enthusiastic comment by all
who have paid a visit to the panorama
To the spectator It seems as though the
battle which destroyed Spain's power In
the Far East was being fought before
his eyes, and the longer the scene is
studied the more fascinating it becomes,
until one can almost hear the booming of
the big guns and the screeching of the
storm of shot from the rapid-fire cannon
that tore the Spanish warships to shreds
and sent hundreds of Montojo's sailors to
their eternal rest. The panorama is de
servedly popular and its popularity is In
creasing daily.

CHEERS FOR THE ADMIRAL
FESTIVAL AND PARADE AT
SACRAMENTO.
People of Santa Clara County Cheer

Companion of Lieuten
ant Hobson.
SACRAMENTO, May I.â The cele
bration of Dewey day in this city to
day was held on a grand scale. Nearly
all the business houses were closed and
a general holiday appearance prevailed.
This morning's parade of decorated
vehicles and bicycles was one of the
principal features of the observance
of the commemoration of Admiral
Dewey's splendid victory over the
Spanish in Manila Bay, a year ago.
The weather was propitious and thou
sands turned out to witness the parade,
which was one of the longest ever held
in this city. It was under the auspices
of the Native Sons and Daughters of
the Golden West. There were rigs of
almost every description, nearly every
one being decorated in exceedingly ar
tistic style with choice and rare flow
ers.
The pageant was headed by a squad
of mounted police, immediately fid
lowed by a large delegation from the
Capital City wheelmen. Following the
bicycle riders was a cavalcade of Na
tive Sons on horseback acting as es
cort to the May Queen, Miss Lottie
Petrie. She rode in a handsome ba
rouche drawn by six gray horses. The
carriage was beautifully decorated
with grasses and white roses. The
director general of the festival, County
Auditor and Recorder Richard T. Colin,
rode in a phaeton beautifully decorated
with pampas plumes.
One of the features of the parade
was the attendance of Mrs. H. W.
Bragg of this city, who was crowned
May Queen in 1853. She was the first
May Queen ever chosen in this city.
In the same vehicle with her were
twenty veterans of the Civil War and
representatives from Sumner and Fair
Oaks Relief Corps and Edward Roby
Circle, Ladies of the Grand Army, as
her attendants. There were also five
little boys in the vehicle dressed in
Dewey suits.
After the parade the celebration was
continued at Oak Park, where thou
sands of men, women and children had
assembled to witness the crowning of
the May Queen and to participate in
the festivities there. As she started to
walk from her carriage to the platform
on which the ceremony was to take

place the immense throng divided and
formed a lane through which she
walked. The multitude had sprinkled
the path with (lowers, lending a beau
tiful and pleasing effect to the scene.
Queen Lottie was escorted by a num
ber of young women and pages. After
the coronation a performance was
given for her delectation, included in
which was a May-pole dance, partici
pated in by sixteen girls beautifully
costumed.
The grounds never presented a pret
tier scene. The booths were conducted
by th*' Native Daughters and were
liberally patronized.. Everything was
aglow at Oak Park at night and the
grounds were packed with merry
makers. The special attractions were
the dancing, an exhibition of stereop
ticon views of the war and the beau
tifully decorated booths. The atmos
phere was bracing and pleasant, which
was an inducement for many to leave
their homes for the suburban spot
where the festival was held.
The celebration of Dewey day will be
long remembered in this city and sur
rounding country.

GREAT DAY AT SAN JOSE.
Men of the lowa Take Part in the
Celebration.
SAN JOSE, May This city and Santa
Clara County paid regal homage to Ad
miral Dewey to-day. All business was
suspended and everybody turned, out to
honor the hero of Manila Bay and to cel
ebrate the anniversary of that victory
over the Spanish fleet.
The Dewey day celebration at Agricul
tural Park under the auspices of the Art
Building Association was the premier at
traction. There was a fine literary and
musical programme, with athletic sports
and a baseball game. Although there
was a wheelmen's excursion to San
ta Cruz and another to Alum Rock, more
than 5000 people attended the. park. It
was one of the largest assemblages ever
gathered there, and by far the most en
joyable. The management of the affair
was in the hands of San Jose's most
prominent ladles, and they surely made
a success of It. The proceeds go toward
erecting an art building in Normal square
to house the $100,000 collection of oil paint
ings donated to the people of the city by
Mrs. M. P. O'Connor.
The feature of the celebration was the.
attendance of Captain Terry and ftity
sailors and marines from the battleship
lowa, George Charette, who was with
Hobson In the sinking of the Merrimac,
was also here.
At the carnival pavilion several thou
sand people were gathered to hear the
patriotic exercises. These opened with
the "Dewey Victory March" by the Fifth
Regiment band. The following pro
gramme was carried out: Invocation,
Rev. J. B. Wakefield; "Star Spangled
Banner." by a large chorus under the
direction of Miss Henrietta Miller; C. H.
Rodwlck appeared as "Uncle Sam" and
Introduced a quartet of dusky young
sters, representing Cuba, the Philippines.
Porto Rico and Hawaii; Mayor Martin
delivered an address of welcome, the re
sponse being by Chaplain Brown; "Bat
tle of Manila" (descriptive), band; cornet
solo, "Remembrance of Switzerland "
W. H. Lake; "Stars anc". Stripes For
ever." band. Nicholas Brown delivered a
patriotic address. The hand rendered
"Capture of Santiago" (descriptive) and
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," was
sung.
The field-day contests between the
Santa Clara High School and the State
Normal School attracted a large crowd
and enthusiasm was high on both sides.
Santa Clara won by a _>core of 67 points to
the Normal's 66.
Santa Clara College defeated Stanford
University at baseball by a score of 3 to 0.
It was about the best exhibition of ball
ever seen here and attracted great atten
tion. Both sides played well. Santa
Clara scored a run in the fourth inning
and two more in the eighth.
The success of the celebration is due to
the efforts of the following ladies, who
comprise the executive committee of the
Art Building Association: Mrs. Mitchell
Phillips, acting president; Mrs. E. O.
Smith, president: Mrs. Nicholas Bowden,
vice president; Mrs. R. S. Holway. secre
tary; Mrs. J. H. Pierce, Mrs. W. B. Hob
son. Mrs. Edwin Williams, Mrs. C. H.

Colonel Philo Hersey, Colonel A. K.
Whitton, Professor R. S. Holway and
Professor F. P. Russell.
At Pacific Grove.
PACIFIC GROVE, May I.â The patriot
ism and pride in the nation's hero of the
people of this place and Monterey were
strongly exhibited to-day in the enthusias
tic! and elaborate manner in which Dewey
day was celebrated. Almost at daylight
flags went up on every pole and all shop
windows anil many residences of both
towns showed prominently the Stars and
Stripes and pictures of Admiral Dewey.
No business was done after 9 o'clock.
The celebration proper began at 10 a. m.
with the Bring of [he admiral's salute
from the- guns of old Fort Halleck by a
squad â¢of Grand Army veterans. At
10.30 o'clock the entire population of both
towns . assembled at New Monterey
Grove, where patriotic exercises arid a
basket picnic were neld. Exercises were
conducted under the auspices of Lucius
Fairchild Post, G. A. R.. of Pacific Grove,
Captain G. D. Clark being officer of the
day. They were begun with a bugle
call, "Reveille," and ended with "taps."
Songs, poems and addresses, all having
reference to the great sailor, in whose
honor the day was kept, as well as na
tional airs rendered o> voice and instru
ment, composed the days programme, an
interesting feature of which was th*' in
troduction to the assembly of H. P. Bick
ford of Monterey, who had been a class
mate of Admiral Dewey at Montpelier
Grammar School, Vermont.
Judge H. D. Talcott delivered the chief
oration, sketching the history of the day's
hero vividly, describing the battle of
Manila Bay and concluding with a glow
i ing eulogy of the man whose great deed
ot one year ago the whole nation com
memorated and the whole world looked
upon with unstinted admiration. The
day closed with the veterans' grand ball
at Mariposa Hall.
At Stockton.
STOCKTON. May Dewey day was
observed quietly in Stockton. Barring the
closing of the public offices and tne
banks, the ringing of the fire bell at 9
o'clock In the morning and the blowing of
whistles, it was like any other day. The
expected parade, which was to be com
posed of a picnic procession planned by
the ladies or the Central Methodist Epis
copal Sunday school, did not take place,
the picnic having been postponed on ac
count of the muddy, condition of the
grounds.
This evening, however, there was cele
bration enough. Bells were rung, whistles
blown and explosives discharged. / The
event of the night was a literary and
musical entertainment at Masonic Music
Hall. O. B. Parkinson delivered the ora
tion. One of the features was the flash
ing of the names of Stockton volunteers
on a screen by means of a Stereopticon
while patriotic, music was played. The
names of all the Stocktonlans at Manila,
or who have returned from there, were
flashed separately. They are as follows:
Arthur Clark, J. W. Galbraith, Bert Con
*!y. A. Nelson Adams, Richard King,
Thomas O'Mara, Ed Charette and Joseph
Piequet Jr. After this the names of
Colonel Fred Funston. Brigadier General
Smith. Admiral George Dewey and Presi
dent William McKinley were thrown on
the screen amid loud applause.
At Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, May I.â Santa Cruz fit
tingly observed Dewey day, every place
of business being closed. At 9 o'clock tliis
morning the (lag at the lower plaza was
raised by the Naval Reserves, who fired
an admiral's salute of seventeen guns.
Mure than 1000 people arrived op the ex
cursion under the auspices of the Garden
City Wheelmen from San Jose, coming
over the narrow gauge in three sections.
This afternon a dance was given at the
Dolphin bath house. 7V;. . ,H
The baseball game between San Jose
and the Sand Crabs attracted an im
mense crowd at Dolphin Park.
This evening the Garden City minstrels
gave a great performance at the opera
house and the cyclers gave a grand ball
at the armory, the music being furnished
by the Marine band of Sun Jose. The last
train left at 11:30.
At Redding.
REDDING, May 1.-ihe celebration of
Dewey day brought to this city one of the
largest crowds of record. Nearly every
town in the county bad Its representatives
and the nearby countryside turned out en
masse. The parade to Wlldwood Park
was followed by the coronation of Queen
Edna; an address by Edward Sweeney,
president of the day, an oration by Cap
tain Thomas B. Dozter. and an address
on Forestry by M. E. Dittmar.
iThe celebration was given under the
auspices of the local lodge of Foresters.
The exercises were interspersed by glee
club singing and band music. The wind
ing of the Maypole by sixteen boys and
girls was a very pretty feature. Open air
dancing and racing took up the afternoon.
Dancing was continued to-night.
The three days' race meet which follows
the celebration has brought to town a
large crowd. - t : >7
At Salinas.
SALINAS, May I.â Dewey day was most
fittingly celebrated in Salinas. No espe
cial festivities were programmed to take
place In the city, but at several suburban
resorts amusement was offered to the vast
crowds that attended. The town was ap
propriately decorated for the occasion.
And everywhere the truly patriotic spirit
was manifest. All Sunday-school chil
dren were taken to Toro Park early in the '-
morning, where appropriate exercises
were held. The largest crowd of people,
however, went to Moss Landing. At tnat ;
place the Watsonvllle drill corps was in
attendance and the day was appropriately !
celebrated. Excursions were run from all j
surrounding places and a vast crowd at- ,
tended.
Only Half a Dewey Day.
SAN RAFAEL, May I.â Rev. Arthur
Crosby; head master of the Tamalpais j
Military Academy, does not seem to hold
an idea in common with the boys of the I
school concerning Dewey day. It seems
from the statements of a number of the
boys that the middle of last week Tutor
Crosby announced his intention of grant
ing no holiday on Dewey day. After
school hours the boys gathered and dis
cussed what action they should take. It
was finally decided to petition Crosby to
alter his determination. A petition was
pared recounting Deweys' feat in con
quering the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay,
the various reasons why the event would
go upon the historic page as one of the
greatest achievements ever recorded, and
the fact that it was the sentiment of the
American people to honor the day. It con- :
eluded by asking that the Tamalpais Mil
itary Academy should not receive the
stigma of being the only school in the ,
State not to show a decent regard for the
day set apart as a legal holiday by the I
Governor. This petition was signed by
every boy to whom it was presented and
carried to the head master on Friday last.
-At chapel yesterday Rev. Dr. Crosby
announced that, in view of the patriotic
ardor displayed by the school, the boys
would be required to attend exercises and
drill only In the morning. Fear of expul
sion caused the boys to make no public
exhibition of wrath until they were per
mitted to visit town this afternoon, and
then they turned loose their opinions.
At Red Bluff.
RED BLUFF, May Dewey day was

BEACON LIGHTS
BURN BRIGHTLY
Twin Peaks were ablaze last night. The
Illumination could be seen from all parts
of the city. A torch was applied to the
monster piles of inflammable material a3
. soon as darkness settled down over the
peninsula, and the flafces burst forth.
They burned like beacon lights for several
hours, attracting widespread attention.
Thousands of spectators climbed the
sides of the mountain, which lies oyer
against the western portion of the city,
to join in the celebration in honor of
Dewev day. The affair was arranged by
the Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs to demonstrate that the members
were alive to the spirit of patriotism, as
well as to that of progress. This latter
quality they have shown in their unremit
ting labors to have the Mission district
improved and brought up to date.
Addresses eulogizing Admiral Dewey
and his gallant men were made by Christ

SPAIN IS PAID IN
FULL FOR PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, May The last
move in the negotiations terminating
the war with Spain occurred to-day,
when Secretary Hay paid to the French
Embassador, M. Cambon, the $20,000,000
provided by the treaty of peace for the
cession of the Philippines. The pay
ment was made in four treasury war
rants of $5,000,000 each, and was re
ceipted for by M. Cambon as complete
ly liquidating the obligation of the
United States in this connection. The
â .Embassador deposited the $20,000,000 in
the ; . ggs National Bank of this city,
and the cashing of the warrants is ex
pected to be made later through the
City National Bank of New York. The
Spanish Government was notified by
cable of the payment, but nothing will

After receiving the ' $20,000,000 Mr.
Cambon folded th*- four warrants and
put them in his card case. He and
Secretary Hay chatted over the speedy
restoration of diplomatic relations be
tween the United States and Spain, for
this payment marked the last step of
the war negotiations. ' Mr. Hay desired
to know when flu- Duke d'Arcos would
arrive In Washington. M. Cambon said
he thought the Spanish Minister would
come in about two weeks, still he was
not certain of this and , lie said it had
been left largely to the Duke's personal
convenience. . ; . -. ' i ;.-â 
A cable notification was sent to
Madrid concerning the payment ami
preparations made for having the war
rants paid and the funds forwarded.
This, however, will not be done to-day,
and the four warrants remain for the
time being in Washington The money
will be deposited entirely in th,- Na

CAPTAIN ROCkIfELLER'S
STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE
WASHINGTON*; May The War De
partment has received advices from Gen
eral Otis since Saturday concerning the
conditions in the Philippines. Two dis
patches received this morning make no
mention of negotiations with the Insur
gents. One of the dispatches was as fol
lows:
MANILA. May I.â Adjutant (General. Wash
ington: Captain Rockefeller, Ninth Infantry,
missing since 7sth ultimo, on line command
ing battalion near Caloocan; visited outposts
9:30 p. m. ; not seen since. Diligent search
made that night, two miles to front: nothing
discovered; no enemy In front. Search prose
cuted ever since without success. Private pa
pers in his. possession found 29th ultimo, two
and one-half miles to front; belief lost course
and captured.
Charles A. Rockefeller entered the
army as a private in the Seventh New I
York in 1811. He served through the Civil ,
War, reaching the rank of first lieutenant |
of volunteers. He became second lieuten
ant In the Ninth Infantry in 1.07. and has
been with that regiment ever since. He
has always been known as a good soldier j
and was "a graduate of the infantry and
cavalry school. He was well up in the .
list of' captains and would have received
a major's commission in a short time.
Captain Rockefeller had not been long
in the Philippines, having arrived there
on April 26. two days before his disap
pearance. He was on mustering duty at
Columbus Barracks until July 30. 189 S. He
then went to Porto Rico and served on
the staff of General Fred Grant until No
vember 1898. He went to Manila with his
regiment, the Ninth Infantry, sailing
from San Francisco March 28.
TEN OF THE GILLMORE
PART V ARE YET ALIVE
WASHINGTON: May I.â The following
cablegram has been received from Ad
miral Dewey : â¢
MANILA. April .'lO. -Secretary of the Navy,
Washington: Apparently reliable information
ten of the Yorktown boat crew, Including Gill
more, are prisoners at Insurgent headquarters.
Am continuing investigation. DEWEY,
Inasmuch as there were ' fifteen mem
bers of the Yorktown party captured by
the Filipinos at Baler, and Admiral
Dewey accounts for only ten of them, it
Is reared that the other five have -been
killed. They probanly were killed or
fatally wounded In the original assault
upon the landing party at Baler.
The identity of the members of the
party still unaccounted for is not known.
A telegram was sent to Admiral Dewey
to-day asking him to inform the depart
ment. if possible, of the names of the
men known to be in the hands of the
Filipinos. It is accepted at the depart
ment that the reason that he has not al
ready these names, with the exception of
that of Gillmore, in his dispatch of yes
terday's date was because he did not have
the information. The insurgent bead
quarters, where Admiral Dewey says the
men are held prisoners, is supposed to be
San Fernando, but there is no assurance
on that point. 'â â -. ";.*:s"-,

GENERAL OTIS IS
SNUBBED BY GAGE
LOS ANGELES. May Contrary to
expectations, Governor Henry T. Gage
left for the .north on the Owl train to
night. This sudden departure will prove
a disappointment to the committee from
the Chamber of Commerce that has in
charge the reception to Brigadier General
Otis, as Gage had been placed at the head
of the list of speakers. Friends of Gov
ernor Gage say to-night that he must
have a motive in his refusal to remain in
Los Angeles for the reception.
A close friend of the Governor is au
thority for the statement that Gage,

Special Dispatch to The . Call. .
WOODLAND, May I.â On Thursday
of last week two women arrived from
the south on the evening train and
registered at a hotel in this city under
the names of Miss Steams and sister.
Both were young and comely, but
traces of grief had chastened the feat
ures of one and she was clad in the
habiliments of deep mourning. On the
following afternoon they departed as
quietly as they came. During then
brief stay they were so reserved in
manner and speech that only two or
three persons learned the purpose of
their visit, or surmised its sorrowful
import. After the lapse of several days
a rumor gained circulation that their
mission concerned the name and repu
tation of a former Woodiahdite, who
recently died and was buried with im
posing honors. The story has been
verified and it discloses a chapter in
his life, strange and sensational, and
the existence of which was unknown to
his wife and child and most of his in
timate friends.
On the 9th of March Harry Smith
died of pneumonia in Raton, New Mex
ico. He was a member of Sacramento
Lodge No. 328 of the Order of Elks.
The body was brought to Woodland
and buried with imposing ceremonies
by the Elks. The funeral services be
gan at the residence of Mrs. Culver,
mother-in-law of the deceased, and his
first wife and daughter were the chief
mourners. Neither of them suspected
that any other woman in the world
claimed the relation of wife to him.
Two or three Intimate friends knew
of his secret, but were willing that it
should be buried in the grave with him
if thereby his widow and child could
be spared anguish and humiliation.
The demure little woman, who tried to
avoid notoriety by registering as a sis
ter to Miss Steams, was armed with a
marriage certificate which attested the
regularity of her marriage to Harry
Smith. The object of her visit was to
plant flowers and make arrangements
for the erection of a monument over
his grave. â¢ â â Â:.':. '
Harry Smith and Miss Alice Tripp
were married In this city in i M. Their
only daughter is almost grown. So far
as their neighbors knew their relations
were never particularly strained. Their
domestic infelicities were not more
than are ordinarily allotted to man
kind.
In May. 1879. Sheriff Griffin went to
Denver with a requisition for Sproute
and Pinkey, two escapes wanted in this
county. He was accompanied on the
journey by Harry Smith. On the re
turn trip Mr. Smith and wife No. -
met for the first time. Miss Haidee
Steams, who had just graduated from
college in her native State of Penn
sylvania, was a passenger on the same
train, on her way to visit a brother in
San Francisco and relatives in Los
Angeles. Learning that Mr/ Smith was
from California she inquired if he knew
her brother. That chance conversation
was the beginning of an acquaintance
that eventually developed into a mu
tual attachment. At Sacramento they
separated, but Mr. Smith and Miss
Steams thereafter corresponded regu
larly and met frequently. In the mean
time Mr. Smith formed the acquaint
ance of Dr. Steams, a specialist, and
the two entered into a partnership for
the sale of eyeglasses.
Last July Mr. Smith took wife No. 1
and daughter to San Francisco to spend
the summer. In the latter part of the
month he gave it out that he was go
ing to the Klondike country. To a
friend whom he met in Sacramento he
said he was not feeling well and was
going to Bartlett Spring.? to spend a
few weeks. Instead he and Dr. Steams
went to Victoria, B. C. From that
point Dr. Steams telegraphed his sister
to join them. When she arrived Mr.
Smith wanted her to marry him. She
had learned that he was a married
man and refused to marry him unless
he could show that he had been duly
divorced. They separated, Mr. Smith
going to North Dakota and Dr. Steams
and his sister continuing to travel to
gether. Mr. Smith applied for a di
vorce in the courts of North Dakota.
It was granted in a short time and he
telegraphed for Dr. Steams and his sis
ter, who joined him in South Dakota,
where a license was procured and they
were regularly married. They after
ward returned to the Pacific Coast,
where they continued to travel. In the
month of February they again sepa
rated at El Paso, Texas, Dr. Steams
and Mr. Smith going to Raton, New
Mexico, and Mrs. Smith to Los Angeles.
At Raton Mr. Smith was taken quite
sick and died rather suddenly.
Immediately after his death the Elks
at Sacramento were notified and on
their orders the body was shipped to
Sacramento. Mrs. Smith No. 2 arrived
in that city shortly after the body and
saw the undertaker preparing it for
burial. A mutual friend learned of her
presence and explained to her that no
body in Woodland knew of his divorce
and second marriage. She was pre
vailed on not to attend th*- funeral and
consented to defer her visit to this city
until such time as her presence would
not cause any suspicion. Her inten
tion was to come and go quietly, so
there should be no scene or scandal,
but the story has leaked out and this
publication will no doubt create a pro
found sensation among the friends of
the deceased, to most of whom this will
be the first intimation that Harry
Smith led a dual life.'

CHARLES STARR'S
PECULIAR STAND
Balks the Search for His
Brother.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May I.â The mys
tery surrounding the disappearance of
Hillary S. Starr from the Oak Knoll
Ranch, near Pasadena, last Monday is
unsolved. Hundreds of people visited
the ranch yesterday and to-day and
searched the country for miles around,
but nothing new developed. In ac
cordance with the theory that Start
wandered away while dazed owing to
the blows indicted by his assailants,
twenty boys yesterday afternoon fol
lowed the llight of buzzards that cir
cled over a canyon for many hours.
The disappearance has aroused the
people to the highest pitch of excite
ment. It was learned to-day that Stan
carried $2000 insurance in the Order of
the Maccabees. The members of his
lodge are taking deep interest in the
search. A dozen members volunteered
yesterday to lend their aid. They called
on Charles Starr, the brother of the
missing man, and endeavored to gain
information that would assist them in
finding Hillary. The brother refused
to meet the members of the lodge and
declined to answer any questions.
This has given rise to the theory that
Charles Starr may know more than he
has told. Since no one who has au
thority is pressing him for information
in- says nothing and answers only in
monosyllables.
As Starr was a crack shot, a diamond
medal sharpshooter of the National
Guard and one versed in the use of
firearms, his friends contend that he
was sandbagged and that he dropped
the worthless pistol he carried after he
was hit. v
Added to all these conjectures many
persons who have investigated the cir
cumstances adhere to the theory that
Starr either left home to enlist in the
army or deliberately made away with
himself in a sensational manner. that
his family might gain what insurance
he. carried on his life.
MRS. JOSEPH DENIS
JOINS THE MISJING
Sick Wife of an Ingleside Man Sud-
denly Disappears in Los

LOS ANGELES, May I.â Mrs. Mary
Denis, â  wife of Joseph Denis of
Ingleside, disappeared on Friday, and
although diligent search has been
made for the missing woman no trace of
her can be found. Mrs. Denis came to Los
Angeles for medical treatment and was
taken to the residence of Dr. L. D. Sherer,
who, after an examination, advised the
patient to go to the Sisters' Hospital.
Sherer requested her to remain at his res
idence while he made some calls and ar
ranged for her entering the hospital.
During his absence, Mrs. Denis left the
house. The husband and friends insti
tuted a search. Failing to flnd the wo
man, they reported the case to the police.
The husband Inclines to the theory that
his wife may have become suddenly de
ranged and taken .1 train to the north.
She had ?15 in cash and a $100 check in her
purse when she left.
She is 34 years of age. 5% feet tall, of
fair complexion, slender build, brown hair
and light gray eyes, and walks lame ow

STOMACH DISORDERâ It is -safe to say that
two-thirds of the people beyond the age â¢ of
puberty suffer from stomach trouble. There are
so very many conditions that may give rise to
disorders of digestion. Among them are heredity,
mental worry, brain work, overwork. Irregular-
ity of meals, irritants, tobacco, imperfect mas-
tication, malaria, liver complaint, constipation
âin fact, the causes of indigestion are too
numerous to mention.
if your digestion is interfered with you will
present one or more of the following symptoms:
Headache (Pig. 1), Pain In Shoulder (Fig. 2),
Palpitation of Heart (Fig. 3), Pain or Heavi-
ness in â  Region of Stomach (Tig, 4), Pain or
Soreness in Side (Fig. 5), Pain in Back (Fig. 6).
Other symptoms that may present are Nervous-

tom (Constipation) may be the direct cause of
your indigestion, or it may be secondary to it.
You will be able to diagnose your own case
from the above. Now for treatment. There is
one remedy that Is infallible in all stomach

ILLNESS OF THE
POPE AS SEEN
BY THE DOCTORS
All the Signs of Old Age, Although
He May Live for Many
Years Yet.
Bpeclal Cable to The Call and the Xew York
Herald. Copyright 15.9, by James Gor
don Bennett.
ROME. May I.â Although old age and
debility are not usually held to be desira
ble possessions, they are not objections
and miKht be even considered as recom
mendations In papabili.
Debility, which in Itself has been con
sidered initial In more recent years of the
disease, may be a normal or quasi-nor
mal condition, as In the Pope's case. Ci
cero's definition of old oge, "Senectus
morbus Ipsa est," has not stood the test
of thousands of years, in which men and
women have reached 90, 95, 100 years or
over and then have suddenly finished the
dying process without a long final Illness,
or sometimes without any illness at all,
or without any agony, such as people
usually have who die very suddenly or
after an exceedingly short Illness, because
their old age has reduced their resisting
power to a minimum. Life may ha, by
a thread and may not snap for months
or even years, keeping in abeyance the
fears of friends and the aspiration of pa
pahili.
Among these Cardinal Rampolla, it is
urged, has tradition and precedent both
against him. Never, 1 am informed, has
the Secretary of State of a cease,] Pope
become Pope himself as Â»he direct imme
diate successor. There is another reason
âa political oneâ why Cardinal Rampolla
might be eliminated from the list of pap i
bili. It is this: He would be hound be
forehand to continue the policy that at
present actuates the Vatican, not only in
ternally, but as regards foreign relations,
and especially as regards the Italian Gov
ernment. This I have on very high
authority. Cardinal Rampolla. who" has
the advantage of being comparatively
your. an advantage not enjoyed by the
papabili in generalâ will, I have- it on the
same authority, stand a very good chance
in the future conclave For the same rea
son he will not be Secretary of State to
the new Pope.
His age brings us back to the question,
"When does old age gin?" Profes
sional cant has it that old age begins with
certain changes in the arteries. It may
not be atheromatous, or a hardening ten
dency, although thai is quite common as
old age comes on. But it is a change of
another kind, more generally, and per
haps the most noteworthy of all senile
processes. It is a shrinking and diminu
tion of caliber and want of elasticity on
the interna coats of the smaller arteries,
those destined to the. nutrition of the dif
ferent organs whereby the blood supply,
which Itself now contains less oxygen,
dees not reach them in sufficient quanti
ties to strengthen them.
The formation of calcareous patches by
resorption of the softer tissues is a con
comitant of this process. The Pope has
them, as we have already seen, on the
aorta. They are rather an appanage of
age in his case than symptoms of dis
ease.
These changes In the arteries In ordi
nary cases begin at about 4.7 and are first
felt in the radical and temporal arteries.
They become more marked as age ad
vances'/extending frequently to the cere
bral circulation. In which, . as a conse
quence of any. violent effort, or spontane
ously, an artery may break, causing apo
plexy or one of the different forms of
paralysis, nd ultimately both.
The Pope is not In this class. Professor
Lapponl affirms that his Holiness has no
disease, nor is the Pope's case one of
marasmus senilis. There is wanting that
complete drying up aud drawing of the
skin that becomes yellow over the face.
His is rather a flaccid skin, of a waxy,
ashy color, and his emaciation, though
decided, Is not so extreme as in marasmus
senilis.
The Pope has senile atrophy. His mus
cles are shrunken and flabby, his carti
lages are hardened and there is a dimi
nution of all the humors of the body and
of the synovial fluid that facilitates the
easy working of the joints. He Is, how
ever, more erect than would be expected
when we take into account the deficiency
of the muscles of the spinal column
which follows hardening of th*- ligaments
and the partial ossification of the inter
vertebral disks which unite to form per
manent curves in the backs of old men.
The Pope's eyesight Is very good. His
eyes show still considerable vitality.
They impart to his face an expression of
I luckiness, although their luster is less
brilliant than it was ten years ago. The
changes that have taken place are chief
ly in the crystalline lens.- which, in all
men of his age, like other transparent
apparatus of the eye, without actually
losing its limpidity and without actually
weakness of vision, refracts light imper
fectly, thus producing what is known as
presbyopia, or far-sightedness, with cor
responding myopia, rendering glasses nec
essary for reading and all near work.
Areas senilis, on the border of his cornea,
in less marked than I nave seen it. Oscil
lation of the ocular globe is less active
and the pupils are small.
The functions of the stomach, liver and
lntestims. though carried out normally,
are slow in action. The expansion of the
chest Is less fuller than formerly, owing
partly to an atrophic tendency of the pec
toral and intercostal muscles and to a ten
dency to ossification of the costal cartil
ages.
The heart Is another organ weakened In
action by age for reasons already men
tioned, and to this weakness are to be
ascribed the sinking periods which
his Holiness has hatl. which, I
repeat, are a constant danger
and which the slightest over
exertion, mental or physical, might pro
duce, or the Influence of cold or of indi
gestion or any sudden shock, having as a
direct immediate result syncope and
death. The atheromatous patches are ln
no way responsible for these attacks. Al
though they are undoubtedly points of
weakness in the general circulation, they
will not shorten the Pope's life a day.
With that one exception, the Pope's
weakness and his old age are normal, the
physiological processes, having begun
some thirty years ago, responding to
fatal, unavoidable changes in th" inner
processes of organic life, which in his
case have proceeded all this time in a
uniform manner without shock to his sys
tem, which with just equilibrium has
â¢adapted- Itself to the atomlcal functional
changes due to his green old age, now
drawing to a close. Men in his condition
may go out suddenly, like the extinguish
ing of a candle, or live on and on until
they just, fade away.
His Holiness is aware that sudden
death might overtake him at almost any
time. Not only is it far from uncom
mon in such cases, but Several of his own
family, the Peccls. with whom old age is
traditional, have died suddenly. longevity
Is bred in some families for generations
by a kind of natural â â election, making the
heredity 'all the more flrm and tenacious
II is so with the Peccls. Going back to
Pope Leo's grandfather, he died at 96,
and it is told of, the Pope that he is per

' suaded he will attain that age. Another
jof his ancestors lived to be over 100.
1 Seventy-five is young to die in the Pope's
family. That is why the eyes of the
whole world are on Rome just now and
that is why there :s constant anxiety
felt, no one knowing what a day may
bring forth. The Pope Is at present as
well as he ever can be, and as the
weather is becoming warmer and more
settled, it Is likely that Professor Lap
pcnl will advise his Holiness to resume
I his visits to the Papal garden shortly.

PROBABLE CANDIDATES
FOR ST. PETER'S CHAIR
PARIS. May I.â "Every one is convinced
at the Vatican that the reign of Leo XIII
is drawing to a close," writes a Rome cor
respondent of the Herald. "Who will be
the next Pope?" i? a question he has him
self to answer. The choice of the next
conclave is being anxiously anticipated by
the whole civilized world, but it is this
very anxiety that makes prediction diffi
cult, seeing that such great political in
fluences are steadily at work to sway the
vote from one candidate to another.
Another difficulty is that in the multi
tude of Papabili every Cardinal of any '
| prominence has claims to be considered ;
! Papabili and this qualification may conse- I
quently he applied to about one-third of j
the Sacred College. Our correspondent says
that of this number only six have any
reasonable chance under the present cir
cumstances of succeeding to the tiara. He
gives them in the order of probability as
follows:
Oreglia, Parocchi, Vannutelll, Gotti,
Svamba and Rampolla. As Cardinal ;
Camerlengo and dean of the Sacred Col
lege, Cardinal Oreglia has great advan- :
tages over his fellow candidates. By vir- i
tue of his office he exercises papal author- j
ity during "interregnum."
Leo XIII. it may be recalled, was Cam
erlengo to Pius IX. Moreover, Cardinal
Oreglia is a candidate of re-election of i
the reactionary party, irreconcilables who
at present rule in the clerical world at
Rome.
Another likely candidate whose present
office would give him great weight is Car
dinal Parocchi. the Pope's vicar general
in Rome, which makes him a kind of
Vice-Pope. He also is of the "Intransi
geants," all the more so because he has
to make amends for youthful liberalism.
. "He would unite the magnificence of
Leo X. the geniality of Pius IX, the
learning of Leo XIII, and, if necessary,
the heroism of Pius VI:" Such is the
magnificent summing up of his manifold
gifts and accomplishments.
Coming next to "papabili," who have
come out in favor of conciliation be
tween the Vatican and Quirinal, we have
Cardinal Serafine Vannutelll, who would
have the reversion of the coveted post of j
Secretary of State. Cardinal Svampa's
candidature is curiou.ny enough due to
the fact that the prophecies of Abbo
Malachy regarding tha Papal succession
might apply to him just as they apply to j
Cardinals Oreglia and Gotti.
The latter is the only monk among
"papabili" and is so exquisite a diplo
matist that no one can tell whether he is i
reactionary or conciliatory in his tenden- '
cies. It is said also that Leo XIII has |
jestingly referred to him as "my succes
sor."
Last, but by no means least, is Cardi
nal Rampolla, perhaps the most Interest- j
ing personality among the candidates. He
is of a bold, downright nature, brooking
no opposition and implacable in hatred.
Should he be called on to succeed Leo
XIII it is known beforehand that the con
: flic, between the Holy See and the House
' of Savoy will very quickly become acute, '
and that any schemes for reconciliation '
. will be relegated to Greek Kalends.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 2, 1899.
AS TO SPHERES
OF INFLUENCE
Parliament Told of New
Agreement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May The Marquis of
Salisbury, Prime Minister and Minister
of Foreign Affairs, and A. J. Balfour,
First Lord of the Treasury, announced
to-day in the House of Lords and in the
House of Commons respectively, the
general drift of the Anglo-Russian
agreement regarding the spheres of in
fluence of the governments of Great
Britain and Russia in China as they
have already been made. -.'. .
Lord Salisbury said he hoped Russia
would consent to the publication of the
text of the agreement when it arrived
in a few days. His Lordship empha
sized his anxiety not to appear to at
tach exaggerated importance to the
specific stipulation of the agreement,
adding: "But of course I attach very
great importance to the signing of this j
agreement because it is a sign of the i
good feeling so desirable between the
.governments of Russia and England." I
His Lordship also expressed the hope
that the good feeling would extend to j
the peoples of the two nations. This j
agreement, he said, was valuable as j
preventing the possibility of a collision ;
between the two governments in China, I
and "therefore," he said, "a guarantee !
for their future agreement for a Ion*;
time to come. I trust that it will lead j
to future agreements on other mat
ters."
TO COUNTERACT RUSSIA.
Trying to Head Off .Railroad Con
struction to the Persian Gulf.
BERLIN, May I.â The Frankfurter
Zeitung publishes a dispatch from Bag
dad, Asiatic Turkey, asserting that Great
Britain has already taken steps to. coun
teract the efforts of the Russian expedi
tion, consisting of seven officers and
fourteen engineers, whicb recently; com
pleted a survey for the extension of the
Tifiis and Kars Railroad from' a point on
the Little Zab River, northeast of Bag
dad, to the Persian Gulf.
According to the advices in question, a
British gunboat has been sent to the Per
sian Gulf, presumably with the object of
taking possession of th* mouths of the
rivers Euphrates and Tigris.
MRS, TINGLEY'S
FOES AT WORK
Theosophists Who Want
an Accounting.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
NEW YORK. May I.â When Mrs.
Katherine A. Tingley, head of the In
ternational Brotherhood League of the
Theosophieal Society. . . arrives from
California she will be called upon to
answer concerning the disposition of
cash, food, clothing and other supplies
contributed by theosophists through
out the country for the benefit of the
destitute in Cuba. E. A. Neresheimer,
president of the league, who is now
with Mrs. Tingley, will also be asked to
tell about the disposition of these sup
plies.
Mrs. Tingley, E. A. Neresheimer. H.
T. Patterson, general superintendent
and assistant treasurer of the league,
and Herbert Coryn, its secretary, sailed
for Santiago on the Government trans
port in February last. The contributed
supplies were taken along, but just how
much cannot be ascertained until the
return of Mrs. Tingley. Aided by
Mayor Bacardi, Mrs. Tingley and her
associates made lists of 400 or 500 fami
lies who were in need of food, clothing
or medicine. Mrs. Tingley seemed well
supplied with money with which food,
clothing and a thousand toys were pur
chased. These were distributed among
the needy, the toys going to the asy
lums, hospitals and schools. â â '.yf
J. K. Elwell, formerly associated with
Miss Clara Barton in Red Cross work
in Cuba, wrote to Mrs. Tingley regard
ing several persons who were in need,
as did Sister Mary Wilber of the Eng
lish Red Cross organization, but both
received a letter from Mrs. Tingley say
ing the brotherhood would do its own
work, and sufferers to which the broth
erhood had been directed received no
attention from Mrs. Tingley and her
associates. The distribution of the
toys interested the children and their
parents and a celebration was held in
the Plaza de Dolores, the expense of
which was trifling.
The work of the organization in Cuba
then terminated abruptly, Mrs. Tingley
and her associates leaving Santiago a
day or two later on a Government
transport bound for New York. Mrs.
Tingley left with Mayor Bacardi a
memorandum of a large amount of sup
plies, which she said might be expected
in a few days, and which were to be
distributed among the families named
in the lists which she left with the
Mayor. Neither Mayor Bacardi nor the
custom-house officials had heard any
thing further regarding the supplies up
to April 12, and there was nothing in
the possession of those officials to show
that the supplies had ever left New
York.
At the headquarters of the league
to-day J. H. Fussell, assistant â¢ secre
tary, said that all the money subscribed
for the relief of distressed persons in
Cuba had been used for the purpose
designated^
DEMAND FOR THE
RECALL OF TORRES
Until Nicaragua Treats Americans
Properly at Bluefields the Detroit
Will Remain to Protect Them.
NEW YORK, May I.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the fol
lowing: As a result of General Torres'
oppressive conduct toward American
merchants trading at Bluefields, Nica
ragua, this Government has determined
to require the Nicaraguan Government to
relieve him from duty at that point. It
is the understanding of the officials that
a demand has already been submitted for
the punishment of General Torres, and
no doubt exists that the Zelaya Govern
ment to show its friendship for the United
States will take the proper action. It is
proposed by the authorities to keep the
Detroit at Bluefields to enforce respect
and to provide protection to Americans
until the controversy has been settled
and there has been a restoration of or
der.
It Is expected by the officials that this
can only be accomplished by the with
drawal of General Torres.

Wardner Citizens Dread
Further Violence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WARDNER, Idaho, May I.â There
were no disturbances in the mining dis
trict to-day. Eleven men were seen
from Wardner going over the moun
tains, each with a rifle over his shoul
der, but their identity or destination
was not known. A considerable num
ber of non-union men left on the train
to-day, also a few strikers, Citizens
are in dread of further outrages from
now until the arrival of troops.
, State Auditor Bartlett Sinclair ar
rived here to-day as a representative
of Governor Stuenenburg. He is search- j
ing : for evidence against the dyna- ;
miters, but cannot make much headway
before the arrival of troops. James !
Ch.yne, wounded by dynamiters on
Saturday, is not expected to live until
morning:
To-day the body of Jack Smith, who
was killed by his fellow-rioters, was
brought down from the Miners' Union
Hall in Burke and is at Wallace in j
charge of an undertaking flrm named
by Coroner France. The remains will
be brought here in time for the in
quest. This will be held at 2 o'clock
Saturday afternoon. Unless the sol
diers have arrived in the meantime the
inquest may be postponed.
A telephone message to-day from
Manager Burkridge of the Bunker Hill
and Sullivan mine directed that the old
force stay together here In expectation
of the revival of work. Excavation of
the ruins of the mill to-day disclosed
the fact that the vault and safe had
been successfully blown open by the
rioters before the building itself was
destroyed. Only a few smoldering ashes
were found within the safe. The loss
to the company from the destruction of
hundreds of valuable documents will
be immense. _
MARTIAL LAW WILL
SOON BE DECLARED
SPOKANE, Wash., May I.â Martial law
will be declared in the Coeur d'Alenes.
Bartlett Sinclair, the State Auditor, who
is at Wardner as the personal representa
tive of the Governor, said there to-night
that the situation was Infinitely worse
than he had realized, and that martial
law is imperatively necessary. He ap
proves the demand for 500 troops made
by Governor Steunenberg and wired the
Governor to-night to urge its being
granted. So far as known no troops have
yet been ordered. The one company of
regulars at Spokane Is still under waiting
orders to move. _ _,_
Some of the non-union miners and Man
ager Burbidge have returned to the Bun
ker Hill and Sullivan. The men are clear
ing away the ruins. The destruction was
complete. A largo number of papers of
Immense value to the property were de
stroyed, including documents of the ut
most weight in litigation now pending be
tween the Bunker Hill and Sullivan and

SPOKANE, May Tho company of
colored regulars stationed at the Spokane
army post received orders late to-night

the morning train for Wardner, Idaho.
The company at Fort Walla Walla has
received similar orders.
Bartlet Sinclair, Auditor of Idaho, in an
interview with the Spokesman-Review
correspondent at Wardner to-night, said:
"The conditions here are far worse than
I could possibly imagine. The prosecut
ing attorney and Sheriff have been
shamefully remiss in their duty. I told
them so to-day. They probably will be
Impeached. Existing conditions here
must cease. The State authorities, aided
by Federal troops, will see to it."

CROOKED WORK
IN DREYFUS CASE
Revelations of Colonel
Paty dv Clam.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, May 2.â The Figaro, continu
ing its publica..on of testimony offered
by the Court of Cassation in the Drey-'
fus inquiry, prints to-day the deposi
tion of Lieutenant Colonel Paty dv
Clam, who on April 29 deposed that be
ing invited to reply frankly to the
statements of Captain Cuignet, he had
obeyed as a soldier, without asking
written orders from his superior, con
tenting himself with oral ones.
Referring to his silence in the face of
accusations and to his being placed on
the retired list, the witness asserted'
that he was "the most f disciplined of
soldiers" and had merited the fate
meted, out to him. He. demanded to be
confronted with Captain Cuignet and
the other accusers. -; " '
In replying to "numerous questions he
said that when General Ie Mouton Bois
deffre, chief of the French general
staff in 1894, wanted him to act as
police officer in the Dreyfus affair, he
asked to be excused and recommended
Lieutenant Colonel Picquart for the
task. General Bolsdeffre refused to
accept this suggestion.
Throughout the inquiry, the witness
affirmed, he had only acted on the ad
vice of the experts in handwriting, MM.
Bertillon and Chocherfort. M. Bertil
lon advised him to dictate lines to !
Dreyfus and therefore accompanied
him.
The report was presented in October,
1894, It did not draw the inference of
the guilt of Dreyfus, but merely stated
certain facts. In December, 1894, Colonel
Sandherr sent him (Paty dv Clam) a
dossier of secret documents to report
upon, and the report which was the
result of his collaboration with
Colonel Sandherr went to General .Mur
der, then Minister of War.
Coming down to the events of 1896,
Colonel Paty dv Clam said he was
ignorant of the doings of the intelli
gence bureau during this period, but
he indicated M. Decrion as being at the
head of a veritable manufactory of
forgeries for Lieutenant Colonel Henry.
(The Figaro remarks that M. Decrion's
evidence has been forgotten or sup
pressed in the dossier of the inquiry.)
Colonel Paty dv Clam said General
Gonze told him in 1597 that he had
minutely investigated the affair and
had proved Esterhazy's innocence of
treason. Again in 1898 General Gonze
told him it was imperative to save
Esterhazy at any price' in order to pre
vent his committal of the Irreparable
acts of suicide or flight and also to
avoid diplomatic difficulties, as war,
owing to the lack of preparations,
would then be disastrous.
It was decided, the witness contin
ued, to save Esterhazy and MM. Grib
bel and Pauffln de St. Morel and the
witness were intrusted with the task.
Then for th*'- first time the witness
acted, he declared, with Esterhazy,
whom he had only seen once in Al
geria eighteen years, previously. He
accepted the responsibility for what he
had done, but declared that he only
acted on orders. He admitted giving
Esterhazy a draft of the articles signed
"Dixi," and also drafts of letters ad
dressed to the President of the republic,
the sending of which was authorized
and covered by General Boisdeffre after
a conference with General Gonze.
In the course of the examination
Colonel Paty dv Clam denied that
he had made any communications to
the press such as Captain Cuignet had
accused him of doing, adding that this
kind of work was done by Henry and
Pauffln de St. Morel.
Paty dv Clam, in the course of his
evidence, said that when M. Cavaignac
became Minister of War he (Paty dv
Clam) wished to warn him of Lien
tenant Colonel Henry's forgery, but the
Minister refused to see him until after
an interpellation had been made.
When he told the Minister that he
had doubts concerning certain docu
ments M. Cavaignac replied: "Mind
your own business."
This statement, the Figaro says, pro
duced a sensation in the court and
Paty dv Clam became frightened and
asked to have it suppressed.
The witness further said that Lieu
tenant Colonel Henry alluded to Gen
eral Mercier when he wrote to his wife
"you know in whose interest I -have
acted."
Replying to a direct quesction
Paty dv Clam said: "General de Bois
deffre promised to cover me; now he
sacrifices me."

BONANZA STRIKE
ON WRIGHT CREEK
New Gold Field Opened
to Klondikers.
Special Dispatch' to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C.. May The
steamer Danube reached port this
afternoon after a fast trip from Lynn
canal ports. She made the down trip
in eighty-five hours. News was
brought by. passengers who arrived by
the Danube of a fabulously rich find
which is reported at Atlin City to, have
been made on Wright Creek. One of
the claim owners on that creek reports
having taken out over $600 in a day.
When news of the flnd was reported at
Atlin City it caused immense excite
ment and a big exodus of miners im
mediately occurred. The miners rushed
off pellmell to get claims on the rich
ground.
Among the Danube's passengers was
H. J. Cameron, one of the rich men of
the Klondike. He owns several bench
claims on Gold Run and has properties
on other Dawson creeks. With Fred
Hall, who accompanied him out, he
brought $35,000 in gold dust and' drafts.
They left Dawson on April 13. When
they left, they say, miners were already
beginning to arrive at the capita} with
gold washed from their dumps on the
creeks. The gold output, according to
the estimates of the majority, will be
over $30,000,000.
The trail is now all broken up. It
is no longer fit for travel. Fifty Mile
and Thirty Mile are both open. Re
ports were current at some of the road
houses of the drowning of miners by
falling through the ice, but none of the
reports could be verified.
Just before the Danube left Skaguay
a citizen was robbed of $400. Several
other robberies have occurred of late
and Skaguayans are afraid the "Soapy"
Smith days are returning. â¢
CITIZEN MELANDER
RELEASED BY SPANIARDS
NEW YORK, May I.â Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Hay was formally notified to-day of the
release by the Spanish garrison at
Ponape, Caroline Islands, of a naturalized
American citizen named Melander, held
as a prisoner of war since last summer.
Mr. Melander is a merchant trading in
the Carolines, and represents a San Fran
cisco firm there. He avowed his Ameri
can citizenship soon after the war began,
and expressed sympathy for the Ameri
can Government. He was arrested and
held as a prisoner of war. News travels
slowly from the Carolines, and it was
sometime before the San Francisco firm
heard of the imprisonment of its agent.
It notified the State Department, and this
Government requested the British Gov
ernment to use its good offices to secure
Meander's release. The British Embas
sador to Spain presented the case to the
Spanish Government, which a short time
ago sent Instructions to the Carolines di- ,
recting the release of the American. I

RAZED BY FLAMES
Sebastopol's Chinatown
Destroyed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA', May I.â Sebastopol
was visited by a disastrous conflagra
tion this mrning. A strong wind
blowing from the north was all that
saved the entire place from destruction.
More than forty buildings were burned.
The fire started in a small frame
building in the center of Chinatown at
8:30 o'clock. For more than an hour it
raged fiercely and it died out only when
it had destroyed everything in its path.
Sebastopol has no fire department
and little could be done to check the
spread of the flames. Not much dam
age was done outside the Chinese quar
ter, but there is not enough of that left
to make even a showing on the map.
Except in the building where the fire
originated the Celestials saved most of
their personal effects. It is reported
that in one house the flames destroyed
a trunk containing a large sum of
money. A number of Chinese are now
guarding the spot where the melted
gold is said to be.
As a result of the conflagration
Sebastopol's Chinese to-night are with
out a place to la./ their heads. -No. esti
mate of the. loss has yet been! ' jrnad<?,
but it is large and falls principally
upon the heirs of . the - late Aaron

SECRETARY ALGER
AFTER SENATORSHIP
' NEW YORK, Many I.â -Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary Al
ger's qualifled announcement of his can
didacy for election to the Senate from
Michigan, provided he does not have to
scramble for the oflice, is regarded as the
beginning of his campaign to succeed Sen
ator McMillan, whose term will expire on
March 3, 1901. Considerable comment was
caused by his statement that he had Sen
ator McMillan's word that he did not ex
pect to be a candidate and that the Sen
ator had promised to aid him all he could.
This caused considerable surprise among
the personal and political friends of Sen
ator McMillan, for they fully understand
that he expects to be a candidate for re
election. One of the Senator's friends
suggested to me to-day that Secretary
! Alger's purpose in talking was to try to
draw from Senator McMillan a definite
j declaration as to whether he desired an
other term in the Senate. Should Secre
: tary Alger succeed in having himself se
lected to the Senate he would regard it as
a vindication of his course at tl_Â» head of
' the War Department. If Senator McMil
i lan determines to be a candidate' for re
| election, however. it is not believed here
that Secretary Alger would be able to de-
I feat him. â  /.

BERKELEY BOYS
PERFORM IK A
TWO-RING .ROW
Clever Circus by the
Athletes.
EDDIE DIXON MAKES A HIT
HIS WORK AS LEADER OF THE
CLOWNS IS CLEVER.
The Famed Oval a Mass of Bril
liant Life and Color on the Oc
casion of the First College
Performance.
A circus without sawdust, and still a !
success! The deficiency was made up by ;
pink lemonade, peanuts, leapers and a !
wealth of clowns at Berkeley Oval yes
terday. The occasion was the first col- '
lege circus promoted by the students of |
the University of California. It was a
marked success throughout. The clowns I
were genuinely funny, the acrobats of the
college, with here and there a professional I
performer, made a programme of merit
throughout. The amphitheater was
thronged, a four-ln-hand drag and a num- ;
ber of fashionable equipages adding to j
the picturesqueness of the scene.
It was all done after the manner of '
the only P. T. Barnum of "the greatest j
show on earth." from the grand entree ;
of all the performers to the side show and
concert. There was the customary street i
k parade, which attracted every small boy
within a radius of miles. Despite the
vigilance of the police, these same small
hoys saw all the show, although the box
office receipts do not indicate their pres
ence. The pageant presented a striking
appearance In the grand entry. First
came a number of mounted Indians in
full war paint and feathers, headed by
the redoubtable Easy, Easy Kaarsburg.
Once well on the cinder path they gal- j
loped around on their ponies, discharging
volley after volley from their revolvers. '
After them followed the college band, led J
by Howard Squires as a drum major.
Then came the performers, the acro
bats, the clowns, Amazons, Uncle Sam j
and the Yellow Kid. Tom Carroll, the
herculean hammer-thrower, clothed in a j
blonde wig, ballet girl's skirts and blue !
and gold striped stockings, passed as j
Little Eva, and was drawn in a chariot.
Carl Parker, dressed as a beau, made a |
decided hit, In company with Mendenhall, ;
his keeper, who developed an accent with
a rich Italian flavor.
The clowns included Eddie Dixon,
Womble, McEwen, Cohen, Duden and'
Zederman. Dixon carried off premier
honors, both as a clever gymnast and
champion funmaker. He was ably sec- I
onded by Womble. The only "Monk"
Chesebrough was an impressive ring- |
master, clothed in top boots, corduroy
riding breeches, a swallow-tail coat and
silk hat.
After two circuits of the cinder path tho
I* apers and tumblers came out and gave
a clever exhibition on the springboard.
A professional tight rope walker gave a
clever performance and was followed by
i. contortionist who twisted himself nt :
Tnany shapes while performing on a flying '
trapeze. A quartet of the clownsâ
Tuny, Argall and Plcotâ sang a number ;
of ragtime ditties.
Tom Carroll, Plaw nnd Al Lean toyed j
with monster dumbbells. As a finish to ' '
their work a heavy stone was placed on
Carroll's chest and Droken with a blow
from a heavy hammer wielded by Plaw.
They were succeeded by a professional
juggler, who was expert in handling
knives, brass balls and other parapher
nalia. An Amazon march was a feature
of the programme. The Amazons were
husky members of the baseball and foot
ball teams. They all wore blonde wigs
and the abbreviated costume of ballet
dancers. They were armed with rifles
and were an awkward squad.
There was boxing and wrestling by
Acme and Reliance Club men. The box
ing between Woodrum and Ford developed
into a hard-hitting match, and after some
good red blood had been spilled in the j
mimic warfare, the bout was stopped.
The clowns were never quiet throughout
the afternoon. They boxed and wrestled,
played leap frog and rough house, per
formed on tbe bar and rode dummy
horses true to life. They also gave a
clever imitation of football practice. The
method of falling on a ball, as taught by
"Gamey" Cochran and the method of the
Stanford men were both shown with the i
aid of an inflated bladder. The dainty!
method of the Stanford man greatly ;
amused the spectators. . j
The principal sideshow was supposed to
contain the famous Stanford ax. The
tent was guarded by a squad of the uni
versity cadets armed with rifles and bayo
nets. " The real ax was not on view. A
negro, whom the spieler called a Filipino.
had his head poked through a big con
vas and the strong-arm boys took turn
shooting balls at his head.
The affair was a marked success, add
ing over $MX) to the funds of the univer

HARRIS' MEN
MAKE A SHOW
OF OAKLAND
Frisco Captures a
Lopsided Game.
TAKE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
DAZZLE THEIR OPPONENTS WITH
GAUDY GROUNDS.
Two Pitchers Crippled in a Vain
Effort to Put a Check to Grow
ing Ratting Averages
of the Locals.
Hank Harris and his hired men cele
brated Dewey day by winning about as
lopsided a game from Oakland as has
been played at Recreation Park this sea
son. Hank and his assistants got up
early in the morning, and with the aid
of large quantities of vari-colored kal
somine decorated the diamond until it
looked like a three-sneet poster of a
circus. The foul lines were marked out
In alternate sections of red, white and
blue, the bases were similarly decorated
and so was the surrounding landscape.
Just in front of the plate .the name
"Dewey" in . large, colored letters gave
the spectators an idea of what it all
meant.
The grounds looked gorgeous, but it
was an underhanded advantage to take of
the cripples, for whenever an Oaklander
started for first he Imagined he was
climbing a barber pole.
Frisco batted out the game right
enough, but Oakland's bunglesâ
ticularly those of Lee Hammondâ were
what made the score so top heavy. Shea
started in to wrap dp the packages for
the Athenians, but in the sixth inning,
after the game was nopelessly lost, he
was taken out of the box and Mosklman
substitute
Six hits were made off Shea's delivery,
four of which were bunched in the fourth.
These, with errors, let in four runs. In
the fifth only one hit was made off him
and that had no bearing on the result, but
Shea went up in the air, gave three bases
on balls, which, coupled with errors,
netted three more tallies.
Moskiman got along very nicely until
the last Inning, when he, too, was sub
jected to a cannonading, three singles and
a double, with accompanying bungles,
giving the home team another- quartet of
sign marks. ;; â¢ .â¢ -.
Yesterday's game demonstrated that
Harris has a brace of twirlers that can
hold their own, or a little better, with
any in the league. Fitzpatrick started in
to pitch, but in the last half of the third
inning O'Neii became involved in a dis
pute with Umpire Levy that resulted in
his being set down, and "Fitz" had to go
into the garden, while Iberg finished the
game. Five was the sum total of
Oakland's hits off Iberg, but one of them|j
was a beautiful triple by Donovan. It
was that shot, followed by a single by
Billy Hammond, that saved Oakland from
the horrors of a shut-out.
Captain Tip's argument with Umpire
Rube was one of the incidents of the
game. O'Neii was at bat and Levy called a
strike on him that was not to Tip's liking.
Refore he had an opportunity to register
a kick another ball sailed up to the plate
and he touched off a single. While rest
ing at first Tip made some unkind re
marks about cross-eyed umpires that lac- !
crated Rube's feelings, so he walked
over to the bag to voice his protest i
against such satirical language. O'Neii
advised Levy to go back to his job and
try and do better in the future. That was
too. too much, so Rube sent Tip to the
bench then and there, Pyne being sent
out to run the bases for his captain.
Stub exchanges of amenities merely
add flavor to the game, however.
Hank Introduced his new catcher,
Swindells, to the home patrons, and the
youngster made a most favorable impres
sion. He handles himself like a veteran,
seems to keep his head at all times. is a
strong, accurate thrower to bases and a
good sticker. Here's to a long and suc
cessful baseball career for the young
man. After O'Neii was retired Pyne i
came in and played second, and was an
agreeable surprise as an inlielder to his
friends. He played third at San Jose
Saturday, Riley being ill, and Harris says
there is not a faster lnflelder ln the
league. It might not be a bad idea for
Harris to change Pyne and Krug, for the
latter is a lightning outfielder, but liable
to go Into the air at critical times when
playing an infield position. - .":
Muller distinguished himself in the sec
ond inning by retiring the side in order.
Three Oakland men in succession drove
out long and difficult flies, all of which
Muller pulled down. The score:

GREAT REINFORCEMENT
FOR THE STATE MINERS
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS NOW
IN LINE.
Officers of the California Miners' As
sociation Form an Allied Branch
With Steve White for
President.
Yesterday's returning owl train from
Los Angeles brought back to the city a
jolly party of representative members of
the California Miners' Association who
accomplished an important feat at Los
Angeles last Saturday eveningâ lmportant
as far as the mining industry of the State
is concerned.
They succeeded in organizing a South
ern California branch .of the California
Miners' Association, thereby strengthen
ing greatly that already strong organi
sation that has been able to secure much
important national and State legislation
in the interest of the mining industry.
Shortly after the last annual convention
of the State association, at which E. H.
Benjamin was elected secretary, Mr. Ben
jamin began a general effort by corre
spondence and otherwise to enlarge the
membership by organizing mining coun
ties that were not among the fourteen
then affiliated with the association. None
of the southern counties which have re
cently come forward into prominence in
the mining world had ever been organ
ized or been part of the association. Mr.
Benjamin wrote many letters to southern
mining men and some leading ones re
sponded in an energetic way. Prominent
among them was O. Breese. one of the
editors of the Mining and Metallurgical
Journal of Los Angeles. , "
Two or three months of agitation down
there resulted in a general movement for
organization which soon became charac

nia should organize by itself independent
ly of the California Miners' Association,
and then ally itself with similar organiza
tions of Arizona and New Mexico. This
particular agitation shows how easily
"Southern California" regards itself as
something apart from the rest of the
State. â 
A general meeting for organization was
arranged for last Saturday evening in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce at
Los Angeles. The members of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association who went
were: Secretary E. H. Benjamin, A. H.
Ricketts, who for years has been chair
man of the mineral lands committee and
led in fighting that battle; Attorney Gen
eral Tirey L. Ford, who is chairman of
the committee on a national department
of mines and mining: Senator John F. Da
vis of Amador, chairman of the Senate
Mining Committee, and Charles G. Yale.
President Jacob H. Neff was detained by
sickness, and Vice President Ralston tele
graphed his proxy to ex-Senator Stephen
M. White with the request that he repre
sent him.
The Chamber of Commerce at Los An
geles was packed Saturday night. Secre
tary Benjamin called the meeting to or
der, and Stephen M. White became chair
man. An animated discussion lasted for
hours. The representatives of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association all pleaded for
unity and others supported them.
The upshot was that a resolution or
ganizing a Southern California branch of
the State association was passed withou*
one dissenting vote. Stephen M. White
was made president and Mr. Breese sec
retary. By this action the association
gains greatly in prestige and influence,
and the unity of the mining industry in
California is assured. County organiza
tions will be formed in the seven south
ern counties, which will unite in formi'^
a Southern. California organization, with
headquarters at Los Angeles, but this or
ganization will be part of the California
Miners' Association. It was a triumph
for the mining industry of the State. The
missionaries returned yesterday and
brought Mr. White along.

AN IMPREGNABLE ADMIRAL.
THE nomination by the Examiner of Admiral
Dewey, once of Vermont but now the naval
representative of the Union, as the Democratic
candidate for the Presidency in [900 is such colossal
impudence that it indicates hopeless imbecility. The
freaks and hysterics of that absurd representative of
morbid egotism have been tolerated for ears, for the
same reason that the antics of a callow youth, ine
briated with his own importance, ire indulgently per
mitted.
When the Examiner-Journal or the Journal- 1
Examiner offered a reward of $50,000 for the discov
ery of the destroyer of the Maine, American citizen
ship within all parties faintly smiled. When it ap
pointed a congressional delegation to supervise and
expedite the work of the Government commission
the public amusement became more pronounced.
When it sent or pretended to send its "Commission
ers*' to crowned heads and other rulers, civil and
ecclesiastical, there was an international chuckle.
When it announced its "national policy," which has
1 een two or three times transmogrified, there was
an unnecessary but derisive laugh. When it pla
carded its "internal policy. the laugh- became a roar.
All these absurd contortions could be endured.
But. by Jupiter, the attempt to appropriate Admiral
Dewey is too much. To convert any distinguished
Vcrmonter into a fusion Democrat, even within his
native State, would exhaust the combined influence
of the Cuban bondholders and the Asiatic specula
tors. To propose the capture of a great national
htro. who has reached the highest dignity among
men in the service of the Government, under a Re-
publican administration, and who has already rejected
every political overture, is a step in advance of all
the idiotic sublimities of the pas It is tolerably safe
to assume that Admiral Dewey will prefer his cocked
hat and his naval standing to the conglomeration of
free silver and socialistic demand? that constitute the
stock in trade of the Examiner.
The Examiner had better resume it- interrupted
employment of converting W. J. Bryan to impe
rialism.
fIMERICfINS IN NICARAGUA.
RECENT reports from Washington are to the
effect that advices received by our Government
from Nicaragua indicate that the situation there
is extremely discouraging to American interests. It
is being impressed upon our officials, so it is said, that
persons high in the Nicaraguan Government are
pursuing a policy deliberately designed to crush
American business interests, now of considerable
magnitude in that country.
Such reports are not surprising. It was but a short
time ago that information was received here of the
inauguration of a political movement in Nicaragua to
bring about the annexation of the country to the
United States. The leaders of the movement were
said to be President Zelaya. General Estrada, Senor
Guzman and others of hardly less note and influence.
It was added that next year a party with annexation
as the principal plank in its platform would appeal to
the people nd make a strong campaign in its favor.
From these reports it is evident that American in
terests in Nicaragua have now become so important
and American influence so strong as to be the domi
nant factors in the politics of the people. Of one
party, it is alleged, the leaders de-ire to crush our
interests; and of the other, the leaders desire to
make our interests paramount even to the surrender
of Nicaraguan sovereignty. -
The American people arc sufficiently acquainted
with charges and countercharges of political parties
to know how to appraise them at something like their
true worth. A good deal of allowance will, there
fore, be mafic for exaggeration on both sides. The
situation, however, is clearly otic that merits watch
ing. The annexation of Hawaii has in all probability
excited in the minds of some Americans in Nicaragua
a desire, to emulate the example of the Americans in
Honolulu. It i- possible that some of them may be
meddling in Nicaraguan politics for the express pur
pose of bringing abot.t a condition of affairs that will
lead to the development of an annexation sentiment
not only there but in the United States.
We have unquestionably great interests in Nica
ragua which must be carefully guarded. The early
undertaking of the construction of the interocean
canal is now well assured, and when that route is
open the How of commerce across Nicaragua will be
enormous. The advocates of unlimited annexation
will therefore have a strong argument on their side,
and they now seem to be getting ready to spring it on
the country. It therefore behooves the people to
watch the issue well or we may have a Nicaraguan
mnexation scheme confronting us I fore we have de
vised a form of government for Hawaii.
The action of Lieutenant Conger in commanding
that the monkey pets of the soldiers returning on the
transport Grant should be thrown into the sea, be-
cause he was afraid they might spread smallpox, may
be taken as an evidence of the recklessness of life
produced by the war. Is not a loyal monkey
enough of a man and a brother to be vaccinated and
saved to grow up with the country ?
The stars and stripes have been raised over business
houses at Bluefields as an emblem of protection as
well as of freedom. The war with Spain has demon
strated to some of our foreign friends that Uncle Sam
can fight when he wants to aud the mood suits him.
THE BATTLE OF MANILA BAY.
YESTERDAY the achievements of Admiral
Dewey and the force under his command were
â¢ appropriately and grandly celebrated. The
clustered glories with which the valor, the training,
the discipline and the in belligence of our navy in
vested the national flag h;eve been depicted in glow
ing eloquence, both in pros** and in verse. The practi
cal aspen- of the destructh of the Spanish squadron
at Manila Bay now deserve consideration.
The lesson of the battle ivas that the character of
naval engagements has radically changed. The re
sult is now largely determined by the excellence of
the materials and the mechanical skill applied to the
construction of war vessels, by the scientific precision
with which they are handle*! and by -the accurate
use of the heavy armaments that have replaced the
lighter guns of former times. The victory at Manila
was a triumphant expression <*:f American science and
of American training, as well as a demonstration of
the superiority of the blended strains of blood de
veloped by our institutions into the composite type
â  -- â -â .-.
of American citizenship.
Our loss was trifling. The loss of the enemy was
comparatively severe. It is probable that in the naval
battles of the future this disproportion will be sub
stantially maintained. Defeated fleets will be de
stroyed beyond the possibility -of rehabilitation. The
victors ordinarily will be almost unscathed. Engage
ments will be short and decisive. One side or the
other will be speedily vanquished. Drawn battles
will be unknown. Ships will not unite iii the bloody
hand-to-hand struggles of the past. 'Hie ability to
support enormous expenditures will be of almost as
great consequence as the human factors in naval con
tests. The sacrifice of life will be insignificant, and,
while now as ever heroism will find its opportunities
and merit its rewards, the power of money will be as
ascendant in war as it has become in the piping
times of peace. .
The American people and their ancestors have al
ways possessed maritime genius. If is historically
recorded that, in 1340. in a naval battle off the harbor
of Slavs, the English King, Edward 111. with his
forces, slew 30.000 Frenchmen, and captured 200 ves
sels, in one of which alone 400 dead bodies were
found. Our revolutionary struggle had scarcely be
gun before the Dolphin, the Lexington and the Re
prisal made two circuits of Ireland and ravaged the
coast. The daring and the successes of Captain John
Paul Jones in British waters are familiar to every
American schoolboy. On February 6, 1778, at the bar
of the House of Lords, it was shown that during the
war 733 British vessels had been destroyed by Ameri
can privateers. After our independence had been won
and constitutionally entrenched, in our operations
against France within two years and a half we cap
tured eighty-four French ship?. The defeat of LTn
surgent by the Constellation and the fruitful cruise
of the Enterprise through the waters of the West In
dian possessions of France, even in that earl day
attested our naval strength. The victory of Commo
dore Perry at the battle of Lake Erie, which com
pelled the British to abandon Detroit and the whole
territory of Michigan, still thrills the patriotic youth
of our country. The speedy entry of Captain (after
ward Commodore) sloat into the hay of Monterey
and the hoisting- of the American flag at that point
on July 2, 1846. thwarted British strategy on the Pa
cific. In the Civil War there were repeated exhibi
tions of American skill in naval construction and of
magnificent American gunnery, of which the duel
between the Kearsarge and the Alabama was a splen
did example.
We are essentia.!'}- a maritime people and have lost
none of our capacity for supremacy on the sea. It
was not till [884 that we comprehended the necessity
of the reconstruction of our navy. But in fourteen
years we were enabled, directly or indirectly, to pro
tect our vast coast line on the Atlantic and the Pa
cific, and at an inconsiderable sacrifice to pound the
Spanish navy into submission at Manila and at
Santiago.
The battle of Manila Bay has truly established a
date in history.
THE GOLD PROBLEM IN THE EAST.
I 7 ITH a national treasury filled to overflowing
WITH a national treasury filled overflowing
and with the great banking centers -"'glutted
with money that capitalists, finding no ade
quate supply of investments on earth, arc buying
stocks inflated with wind, the general public of the
East is loudly complaining of a lack of currency. The
situation is peculiar, and the press of that section is
naturally giving a good deal of attention to it.
From all reports it appears there is an abundant
supply of currency for all purposes when gold, silver
and paper are taken together, but the Eastern public
will not use gold. The treasury officials have found
it impossible to get it into circulation. Treasurer
Roberts is reported to have said recently: "The ap
peals for paper are becoming absolutely piteous.
There is a special demand'- from Kansas City and
points in the South and West. The treasury is run
ning over with gold, and we could get several mil
lions more gold than we have if we had small notes
to exchange for it.
. A considerable number of our Eastern exchanges
maintain that the objection to the use of gold is due
to the fact that it is not coined in a way to make it
available for retail trade. The Philadelphia Record,
for example, says:
"Two-thirds of all the gold which has been received
at the Government's coining mill since the establish
ment of the mint in 1792 has been coined into $20
pieces, and two-thirds" of the remainder into $10
pieces. Coins of these denominations tire too valu
able for general use in retail transactions. The pro
portion of $5 pieces and $2 50 pieces struck at the
mints is so small that if a demand should be created
to-morrow for these coins for general use they could
not be obtained.''
While there is unquestionably some force in that
argument, it cannot be accepted as conclusive. In
saying that if there should lie a demand for $5 and
$_' 50 gold pieces the supply is so small they could
not be obtained for general use, the Record itself,
seems to concede that there is at present no demand
for gold of these denominations any more than for
the larger coins. If that be so â if the demand is not
sufficient to make use of the small gold coins already,
minted, it is certainly illogical to conclude that more
cf them are required.
The weakness of the position taken by the Record
and so many other Eastern papers is most conclu
sively shown, however, by the fact that California
uses gold and silver almost exclusively, and there has
never been any complaint here of the manner in
which it is coined. In fact, there would probably be
serious objections to the coinage of $2 50 gold pieces
on account of the smallness of the coin and its conse
quent inconvenience in use.
The Eastern objection to gold seems to be mainly
the result of habit. Cattle brought up on the prairies,
having never seen corn, can hardly be induced to eat
corn until hall starved. Eastern retailers are unac
customed to gold coin and arc afraid of it. It will be
of advantage to the nation, however, to induce them
to use it, even if it takes a little currency starvation to
force them into it. JThe general use of .gold as cur
THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, HAY 2, 1599.
rency will tend to hold it in the country when other
wise it might be shipped to Europe. It is to be hoped,
that it will not be long before the East reaches the
California standard in this matter and gold coin be
comes the common currency of the country.
SPEAKER REED AND THE PUBLIC.
WHILE Speaker Reed has not thought it worth
while either to confirm or deny the reports that
he will not serve in the next Congress, the
country generally has reached the conclusion that the
rumors are correct, and, what is more, the prevailing
opinion seems to be that he is to retire not only from
Congress but from politics, and that we are to know
him no longer as a statesman and a party leader.
In no section of the country is the belief that Reed's
public career is closed more dearly asserted than in
New England. Nearly all the newspapers of that sec
tion have treated his retirement very much as if it
were his death, and their comments on the subject
have been in the nature of funereal eulogiums. The
fact that Mr. Reed is said to intend to leave New Eng
land and settle in New York may have something to
do with the dolorous New England view of the sub
ject. Such a removal is doubtless equivalent in their
judgment to a departure from the land of the living.
Certain incidents attending the ex-Speaker's de
parture from New York for Europe strengthen the
belief that he really intends to abandon his Presi
dential aspirations and give up politics, as the New
England papers assert. In the first place when, on
the eve of sailing, a reporter told him the public is
interested in the rumors about him and would like to
.â¢mow whether they are true or not. Reed replied:
"The public may be interested in me, but I have no
interest in the public." In the second place while
Croker, who sailed on the same -hip. was attended by
a host of people who came to bid him good by. hardly
any one paid any attention to Reed. fie went away
like an ex-President rather than a Presidential can
didate.
In spite of all these evidences that the strong man
has abandoned the arena of his life's best work, he
may yet return and become a more potent factor in
our political affairs than ever. The whirligig of time
brings about many changes, and not infrequently they
occur with great rapidity. Mr. Reed represents so
much of what is- best and wisest as well as what is
strongest in Republican leadership it is not likely he
will be permitted to remain aloof from the great
struggles that are coming in the near future.
It is to be noted, moreover, that many Democrats
who once denounced him as "Czar" Reed have not
hesitated now to declare that his retirement from
politics is a national misfortune. He represents, in
fact, the conservative anti-imperial business element
of the nation in a higher degree than any other states
man. with the possible exception of the President
himself. McKinley's administration has been so suc
cessful in home politics and so victorious in foreign
affairs that his re-election in 1900 i- a foregone con
clusion, but Reed i- not too old a man to be hi- sue-

( essor, ami events may so shape themselves as to
render his return to Republican leadership inevitable
within a few years at most.
BOSTONION BRYANISM.
ALL the world knows that Bostonian ideas arc
classical and metaphysical, and that Bryanism
is but a declamatory demagogucry. therefore
it is to be expected that a Bostonian Bryanism would
be a demophysical metagogucry expressed classically
in declamatory' terms. That expectation has been
realized. George Fred Williams of Boston has for
mulated the principles of Bryanism into four dogmas,
ows:
1. if monopoly has occupied the avenues of com
munication the people can dispossess it.
2. If the land has passed into tin- hands of idlers,
who buiid palaces from th.- pennies of labor, we
can send these Idlers to tip plow.
'... If industry's Implements are possessed by an
oligarchy â * democracy can resume possession.
4. if wealth can buy Legislatures, wo can legis
late for ourselves.
These dogmas come to us without anything in the
way of an explanatory chart, diagram or appendix,
and the Western mind therefore will have some diffi
cult} in understanding the problems of life, mind,
politics and reform involved in them. It is worth
while, however, for all citizens to make an attempt to
penetrate their true inwardness and discern, if pos
sible, the thingness of the vacuity in which they are
immersed, for there may be a bug in their mazes.
The first dogma appears to be a Bostonian way of
saying democracy can take possession of transporta
tion lines if it feels like it, and may be regarded as a
declaration in favor of Government ownership of rail
ways. The second is very obscure. It may be an
occult expression in favor of the nationalization of
land, or it may be a proposal to establish a system
of compulsory plowing on the part of the Astor boys.
The third dogma, maintaining the rights of democ
racy to take up "industry's implements," is a stag
gerer. It seems to imply that Democracy might go
to work, but such a move within the camp of Bryan
ism is inconceivable, and the solution ot the problem
must be left, therefore, to the hazard of a guess.
The last of the four is what is known in the West
a- a "corker," but doubtless it would be recognized in
Boston by some other name. "If wealth can buy legis
latures, we can legislate for ourselves." Apparently
that means that if wealth buys legislation every man
shall become a legislator and get iii- share of the
bcodle. If it mean not that, then it must have some
mysterious reference to an omnibus referendum,
popular initiative and imperative mandate.
Whatever views may be taken of them, it is clear
these dogmascontain in their illucid depths the esoteric
tenets of Bostonian Bryanism. While to outsiders
they may seem but another attempt to "scrut the in
scrutable and poss the impossible," they are utter
ances of the oracles of the dollar dinner, and beneath
their froth may be deeply fraught with the force of
tate. It is probable they will meet us at Philippi in
1900, and it behooves us to take note of their ghostly
threats.
The appointment of the Board of Health by Gov
ernor Gage requires no special criticism. The gen
tlemen chosen may be competent, but the manner
of their selection proves the indifference of the execu
tive to the best interests of the State and of his party.
Dr. 'Barbat, one of the appointees, is the family phy
sician of Daniel M. Burns. Dr. W. B. Coffey is
chief surgeon to. the Market street railway combine.
The complete subserviency of Governor â  Gage to
railroad influences is now freshly illustrated, but has
been long predicted and virtually confessed.
The Labor Council of this city has a suspicion that i
Governor Gage is trying to sell it a gold brick" in
reference to the- appointment of a Labor Commis
sioner. When the Labor Council of San Francisco
becomes better acquainted with Governor Gage the
suspicion will be transformed into a certainty.
United States Senator Perkins has added another
reason to the many which entitle him to the kindly
consideration of the people of the State. He has
made Governor .Gage his enemy.
RANCH AND RURAL LIFE
An inquiry was addressed to the question department of this paper
about the value of irrigation i" prevent injury to orchards and vineyards
by frost. The utility of irrigation for that purpose is demonstrated. The
reason of it lies in the temperature of the water. The water of springs,
which is spoken of as ice cold, in hot weather, has a temperature of 60 de
grees. When the air has a temperature of 100 degrees the water is 40 de
grees colder than the air. a difference at once perceptible in its grateful
coldness when used to quench thirst. But' when the temperature of the air*
has fallen to 32 degrees the water remains at 60 and is 28 degrees warmer
than the air. Water flowing in streams or impounded in reservoirs is pen
etrated, more deeply by the sun's rays and therefore warmed more pro
foundly than the ground and is also warmer than the air at the frost
point. Now, if this water, warmer than the air, is set flowing through an
orchard or vineyard, being warmer, than the air, it raises the local tempera
ture, raises the dew point and averts frost.
The orchards of the British isles cover only 226,059 acres.
The navel orange leads all others in the English market, and the Eng
â¢ lish Fruit Grow says it has a great future. ;
The jute bag supply from merchants who import from Calcutta 'and
the jute mill at ' San Quentin amounts to 41.000,000 bags. If all these can
be m_fde of flax tow it will be seen that flax will become a leading farm
crop in this State.
The Japanese soy bean, used in the German army ration, is grown suc
cessfully in Kansas. it is put on kind after wheat or oats, in the same
year, and its value is $4 60 per acre net. No doubt it would yield a greater
value in California.
Remember that the foundation of good living and of good cookery is
good eggs. Ten average eggs weigh a pound and they have as much nu
triment as a pound of porterhouse steak. Good eggs are produced only by
hens fed on good, pure, untainted food.
The investigation of the California State Board of Trad" into irrigation
by pumping demonstrates that it will give a <rreat impetus to small farm
ing, and that small landholders will.be increased in Dumber by its use.
It will also directly aid truck farming, diversification of crops, and the
adornment of rural homes by shade trees and flowers. All these things go
to the increase of the profits and the pleasures of rural life, and the Board
of Trade should continue to preach the gospel of the pump.
A FAIR LITTLE WORLD OF MY OWN.

Of all that is bright. â¢
And all that is right;

From voices whose echoes were fleet.
And so oft when with fancy I flee

The charm that sin- lends
To faces of friends
Who live not in visions with me.
A charm from the flashing In sight
Of 'thoughts that with love are alight,

With grace over all
And linger with tenderness bright.

From throngs in which one is alone,
The shailows uplift.
And restful tides drift,-

STATE NOTES.
Mr. Flynn of Red Bluff proposes to give a comprehensive trial to the
Australian salt bush as a forage plant in arid situations. From the study
so far made of it he believes it will convert land at present waste and
useless into valuable pasture.
Talk of th" high price of meat, it is nothing to the "price paid in the
flush times. The Bee says that at Sutter's Fort there is the picture of a
grizzly hear that was killed in the tules near Sacramento in early days. The
animal weighed 1400 pounds and the hunter who killed it sold it to a Sac
ramento butcher for $1000. The butcher dressed the meat and retailed it
and it brought him $1700, so thai he cleared $700 in the transaction.
The vine hopper is reported to have appeared at Fresno. Last year the
hopper did not do much damage and absence of the pest is now attributed
to the dry weather.
Last week ripe strawberries were shipped from Florin, Sacramento
County, to Sail Lake City, Portland, Or., Seattle and Spokane. The prices
obtained vere $8, $4 50, $3 T.". and $8 per crate. It is of record that Florin
strawberries have been shipped to Maine and arrived in good order.
Th.- Bee Is of pinion that Placer County fruit growers will wear dia

promising.
Elwood Cooper, the Santa Barbara olive grower, used to spend $7000 a
year spraying his olive trees to keep down the black ncale. Now he
doesn't spend a cent, but turns the Rhizobius Ventralis, an Australian
lady bug, loose and they eat the scale and smack their lips for more.
The Cutting Packii* Company has built a cannery in Santa Ana and
will put up apricots, string beans, blackberries, plums, asparagus, peas,
strawberries, tomatoes, yellow free peaches, yellow cling peaches and rasp
berries. It is a good indication to see more attention given to the canning
of vegetables. f--
The Oroville Citrus Association started in 1886 with $20,000 paid up capi
tal and put in twenty aires of navel oranges. The stockholders have since
paid in $4000 assessments and now have an orchard of sixty acres, all in
navels, valued at $60,000. The first crop was shipped in 1891. The crop of
1898 netted $9000, or 43 per cent on the original investment, and 15 per cent
on the valuation of $1000 per acre. Let it be remembered abroad that Oro
ville is in Butte County. Northern California, nearly in the latitude of Chi
cago.
The first full carload of California fruit shipped East this year went
by passenger train on the 25th of April. It consisted of cherries and the
Pringle apricot. â¢:. .
A band of 500 sheep were sold at Anaheim for export to Wyoming, at

MAY ATTEMPT
TO CORRUPT THE
SUPERVISORS
Plan for a "Cork
screw" Electric Line.
â â
The attempt that Is being made by the '
Market Street Railway Company to se- :
cure permission from the Board of Super
visors to construct and operate an elec
tric line along Sixth, Taylor, Geary, Grant '
avenue and Bush street lias reached a
condition that bids fair to Involve . the
board in a scandal of sufficient propor
tions to throw a strong light on the meth
ods employed by the giant corporation to
attain its ends.
It is asserted, and the assertion is
backed up by evidence, that the permis
sion prayed for is worth at least $50,000 to
the corporation, which would mean, of
course, a corresponding loss to the city
It is pointed out by the same authority
that the corporation can well afford to
and will if necessary, expend $20,000 lri
purchasing the votes of Supervisors in
favor of granting what is asked. if this
or any other sum ol money is expended
in a successful attempt to corrupt the
members of the board the result will be
that the corporation will be granted gratis
the right to erect electric poles along the
streets named; will be confirmed fn Its
title to franchises now held to be forfeit
ed; will be granted new franchises free of
charge, and will be put in a position to
make worthless to the public the valuable
Geary-street franchise, which will revert
to the city in 1902.-
As a. means for the t acquirement of all
these things without cost to, itself the
Market Street Railway Company has
asked for permission to build a "cork
screw" electric road to traverse the
streets heretofore named. A representa
tive of the corporation recently ap
proached a member of the board with a
so-called explanation of the reasons for
asking such extraordinary concessions.
"Our company does not want to build
this road," he said, "but we are willing to
do so because the down-town business
men want it. The Post-street. Kearny,
Mission anil Market streets lines now han
dle all of the traffic that would be carried
by the new road, so you see we will be out
just what it costs us to build and operate
the new line. But the business men want
; it, and we are willing to shoulder the ex
pense in order to satisfy them."
The argument was so convincing that
. the Supervisor to whom it was addressed
turned to one of his associates with the
remark: "These fellows must take us for
a lot of 10-cent schoolboys."' *
The Geary-street franchise is one of the
most valuable in the city, and when it re
verts to the city in 1902 it will be sold to
the highest bidder. By granting the
Market-street company at this time per
mission to erect poles and operate an elec
tric road on the street, from Taylor street
to Grant avenue, would be equivalent to
giving that corporation a vested right in
the franchise and would make it practi
cally worthless to any company other
than the Market-street monopoly.
As proof of the fact that the scheme on
foot is to i;. control of the Geary-street
franchise, as well as other valuable con
cessions asked for, the manner in which
the corporation's representatives treated
a suggestion made by si vera) members of
the Board of Supervisors is cited. It was
snggested that Instead of turning down
Gearv street from Taylor, tin proposed
road he extend* d another Mo, on Tay
lor street and that it then turn down
Post street to Grant avenue. This propo
sition was rejected, in spite of the fact
that the corporation is seeking permis
sion to transform the Fost-Streel cable
road into an electric road, and would thus
be enabled to save the building of four
blocks of electric line on Geary street.
It Is apparent, therefore, that th* cor
poration considers die occupation of
Gearv street important in a measure
wholly at variance with the unwonted
philanthropy that is alleged as a motive
for building the proposed road.
The request of th*- Market Street Rail
way Company is now in the hands of
the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors and has been referred hy it
to the City and County Attorney for an
opinion as to the effect the granting <.f
the request would have on existing fran
chises. Those who are miliar with the
methods of the corporation declare that
upon the report of this committee will de
pend the question of whether the com
pany will attempt to gain Its ends by the
purchase of votes.

HOT FAVORITES
TUMBLE HARD
AT UNION PARK
Soubrette Wins the
Reserve Stake.
â 
HEAVYWIND HAMPERED HARES
GLEN ROY WENT TO DEFEAT IN
THE FINAL.
j . '
A Large Crowd Watched the Sport
and Betting Was Far Above
the Average on Dog
Races.
Yesterday was a day of short undtfs at
Union Coursing Park. In the second
round of the unfinished reserve stake
eleven of the thirty-two courses were de
cided in favor of the lesser dog, and in
Ihe ialt* i part of the game nine oi the
dogs r..ttd below par rewarded their
backers with more than the money 111
--vested. The greatest fail of the day oc
curred when Clifton Lass, after chasing
the rabbit for nearly five minutes, was
given trie flag against Little Joker, a 6 to
1 favorite. The course in which this oc
curred was exciting and both dogs ran to
a standstill] Clifton Lass fell just before
the en 1 and was withdrawn for the day.
A strong wind continued throughout the
afternoon and none of the hares endured
very long. In the third round the sport
livened, however, and the spectators
watched several fairly long match- - and
also some good grand stand work by
Black Bess and Sportsman. The betting
throughout the day was extremely heavy
and a iarge bulk of money was played on
short euders. The crowd was above th.
average.
SouUr-tte took first money. In the final
she went to the slips with Glen Roy, und
the betting on the pair was even. In the
sixth rojno Glen Roy met Forget. The
latter dog led for several lengths; when
the hare swung suddenly in Glen Roy's
favor, giving nim the advantage of a
pretty pick-up. Rollicking Airs was de
feated by Glen Roy after having had
man;, hard and gruelling chases He was
on Sunday's card, as well as Saturday's,
and â¢a*- work of three successive days
told heavily and robbed him of his
chances for the stake wfien the filth
round was run down. Candeiaria showed
up in good form and surprised the talent
by lasting until the fifth round.
The, following are the results:

THE TALE OF A BOILER.
How Robert Collan Fared at the
Hands of a Usurper.
Robert Collan was treated at the Har
bor Hospital yesterday for a broken nose
and a lacerated wound of the scalp.
Robert has been making his home in a
boiler which lies, in a vacant lot on
Steuari street for some time past. After
a day spent in picking up a living ho re
tires to his couch In the tar corner of the
boiler and there sleeps the sleep of the
just.
Sunday night Robert spent in revelry,
and yesterday morning when he returned
to his boiler home he found another ten
ant in possession. There was an alterca
tion, and angry words were followed by
blows. Robert had his nose broken but
finally ejected tin- other man. The latter
then began throwing rocks, with the re
sult that Robert's scalp was laid open.
The usurper then fled and Robert hied
himself to the Harbor Hospital to have
his wounds dressed.

P. TULLY ASPHYXIATED.
Found Dead in Bed With the Gas
Turned On After a Protracted
Spree.
Patrick Tuliy. machinist, was found
dead yesterday morning- in his room at
543 A Castro street. The air In the apart
ment was heavy and stifling with the
fumes of Illuminating pas, and the stop
cock of the pas fixture was turned on.
Tully was a machinist .771 years old and
had been drinking heavily for some time
past. He was very much intoxicated last
Sunday night when he went to his bed,
and his friends are of the opinion that
his death was accidental, and that the
gas escaped because the stopcock was
loose and had been turned off and on
again inadvertently by me deceased.
No writing was found in his room to
show that lie had contemplated suicide,
and he had made no threats previously
of that kind. An Inquest will be held this
morning.

BOOKIE COULD
NOT KEEP OUT
OF GUN'S HUGE
Talent All Seemed to
Be Sharpshooters. .
RING AT OAKLAND HARD HIT
ADOLPH SPRECKELS CAPTURED
THE DEWEY HANDICAP.
Joe Ullman Beaten by Rosormonde
for Mayday Handicap Wy
oming Proved a Sur
: * prise.
â¢
Dewey day saw a perfect fusillade of
coin in the betting ring at Oakland track,
and the bookmakersâ flrstâ viewed
with well-defined glee the bombardment.
Th.*- California Jockey Club made no mis
take when it reserved Mayday for its
own. the attendance being one of the
largest of the passing season. Backed
horses were prominent at tho finishes
throughout the afternoon, and the ma
jority of books suffered . severe losses.
Not all favorites won, for of seven Pelx
otto, San Tomas, Joe Ullman and Cas
take went down to defeat.
The Dewey handicap, the spreadeagle
affair of the campaign, did not turn out
a very warlike affair. Ihe distance was
one mile and a quarter, and the 7 to 1"
favorite, Adolph Spreckels, carrying 11"*
pounds and Piggott on his back, won with
consummate ease. Cavallo. a 00 to 1 out
sider, succeeded In beating the heavily
played, second choice, Merops, for the
place.
Then followed the Mayday handicap, at
a mile, which proved a much more spirit
ed and sharper conflict. It also resulted
ii* the complete rout of the favorite, Joe
Ullman. Latter, with John Reiff at the
points, was nearly knocked over the fence
at the first turn, falling back to last posi
tion. After this mishap the Duke A
Wishard mystery made up an acre of lost
ground, reaching the wire in time to be
led out half a length by Rosormonde.
Burkes mare was 7 to 1 in the betting
and made all the running.
A very warm favorite was bowled over
in the opening sprint. I'eixotto, with
Bullman â¢on his back, closed a 3 to 10
chance, but failed to have his usual sup
ply of speed aboard, finishing third.
Bessie Lee, a 7 to 1 shot, ridden by Char
ley Macklin, won ridden out from Widow
Jones. . .'y . .. .-
"White Hat" McCarty's orange colors
were carried to the fore in the two-year
old scramble by May Gertrude, a full
sister to Belle Bovd. The ring laid 5 to 1
about the Ally, and at the wire Narvaez
landed her a winner over Gllssando by a
length. The favorite, San Tomas, ran
as if green, but should do later on.
The seven-furlong run for maidens was
made the medium of a terrific plunge on
Mlgar. The big bay colt had Piggott
up, and backed from 8 to 5 down to 7 to
1". won in a walk. Sylvan Lass, poorly
ridden by Romero, finished on the outside,
taking the place from Ed Lanigan.
When a hunter drew a loaded shotgun
from a wagon muzzle-end first, and later,
when one barrel went off, taking one of
his arms, he excused himself by saving
he "Didn't know it was loaded." Johnny
Reiff rode Castake in the mile and a six
teenth run and handled the gelding just
as lf â" he didn't know the public backed
him." In and out *f several pockets,
with nothing in front of him, his mount
was downed at the wire by Wyoming, the
second choice. Don Vallejo, a 100 to 1
shot, finished third.
The final six-furlong sprint fell to Mo
corlto. the even money favorite. Dolore
led into the stretch, when Jenkins fool
ishly eased her up, only to l"- defeated by
a head.

HURT IN THE PARK.
Attorney John C. McKee Thrown
From His Bicycle and Seri
ously Injured.
There was only one serious accident
yesterday In Golden Gate Park to mar
the pleasure of the thousands that
availed themselves of a day's outing. At- ,
torney John C, McKee of 809 A Bush
street, whose office is at 230 Montgomery,
while returning from the Cliff Louse on !
his bicycle In company with his friend,
Attorney J. F. Fassett, was run over by
a vehicle at Fell and Baker streets, just
inside the panhandle of the park, and se
riously hurt. Dr. Niemeyer, the phy
sician at the Emergency Hospital, says
that his condition is exceedingly serious
and that his chances of recovery are
about equal.
The collision was accidental. McKee
was attempting to gel ahead of one ve
hicle when he ran Into another, lie was
thrown from his wheel and run over. Tiie
police patrol at the Golden Gate Park sta
tion happened to be passing at the time

Emergency Hospital. It was found that
he had sustained a severe fracture of tin
skull at the base of the brain on the j
right side of the head, and he also had
several severe contusions on the face
over the left eve. His Injuries were at
tended to by Dr. Niemeyer and Dr. A.
11. Sweeney and he was removed to his
home. Mc Kee Is a middle aged man. He .
came here from Kansas several years
ago, and it is said that he was a Judge
back in his native State. The names of
the people who were In the vehicle that
ran over McKee could net be learned,
as no arrests were made. y_

MEN MATCHED BY THE
SAN FRANCISCO CLUB
TWO HEAVY-WEIGHT BOUTS OF
TEN ROUNDS EACH.
The National Club Will Give a Box
ing Carnival Open to All Classes
of Local Scrappers.
The San Francisco Athletic Club com
pleted arrangements last evening for its.
fistic entertainment whlfh will be held on
Friday evening. Commencing with the
next how the club will be represented by
Alex Greggalna as the official referee,
who, with the assistance of two judges,
will decide all contests. The event of the
evening will be "an eight-round bout be
tween Bob Jones of Los Angeles and
Chick Haywards of Portland. It is said
that Jones whipped Dan Long in one
round, and that it took big Jeffries three
rounds to accomplish the same trick.
Haywards is thought well of, as he de
feated Van Iluskirk recently rather eas
ily. The preliminaries will consist of
eight-round bouts between Gus Koster
nnd Sam Bruit Paddy Maloney and Ed
die Toy and Charles Thurston and M. Mc-
Clure.
The game will commence at S o'clock
sharp, so thai the spectators can get j
away at a reasonable hour.
The Western Club was seriously think- j
ing of matching Neill, who defeated Tra- j
ccv recently, against George Green, but
as" the latter is too heavy and too x
perienced for Neill, the friends of the last j
named pugilist are advising him to seek
smaller gam* before tackling the artful j
George. Doubtless the Western Club will
hunt up some welter-weight among the
local fry who will prove a better drawing |
card than Green.
The National Club proposes to give a
four days' boxing carnival in the near
future. Manager Gibbs is of the opinion
that a series of contests between local
middle, welter and light weight profes
sional pugilists (as all boxers who contest
for a monetary consideration are profes
sionals) would be well patronised by the
sporting fraternity of this city, who arc
anxious to see what kind of talent can be
got from among the boys who are now
boxing for small sums at the "side
street" clubs. Neill; Green. Corbett. Shar
key. Chovnski, Hawkins, Smith and other
professional fighters of note boxed us
amateur:-, in tins city and sprang to fame
from the ranks â¢>!" the common herd. The
Intention of the National Club managers
is to bring out the latent talent nd to
match the winners of the different classes
against Eastern men. The idea is con
sidered to be good, and whether It will
prove a success financially or not the Na
tional Club has concluded to go. ahead
with the scheme. Fuller particulars â¢con
cerning the nival will be announced
in a few days.
Billy Smith, the "Mysterious" crank, is
ir.aithed to light a welter-weight in Salt
Lake; but it is safe to say that when the
Salt Lakers have had a sample. of Smith's
ways of doing business, they will remem
ber what the San Francisco papers have
said about him.
Billy Lavigne Is not going to land.
The managers of the club in which lie ex
pected to Tight Kurge have been informed
of how Lavigne pulled the wool over the !
eyes of the sporting people of this city,
ainl they wisely concluded not to send
him expense money and declared the
match off. Lavigne, however, has seen
his best days, and to win he must take
on small game in future.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 1.-The market to-day
suiYcred from general liquidation and confident
operations by the bears. The passage of the
Ford franchise tax bill early unsettled the
market because of the weakness displayed by
the stocks most concerned. Supporting: orders
by parties largely identified with various prop
erties and covering by the shorts steadied the j
market for a while and some recoveries oc
curred. A renewal .of large offering* brought
prices down in a semi-demoralized fashion and
the closing was at the lowest for practically
all Stocks. Stop-loss orders were met in a
variety of stocks and the pressure continued to
the end. The pronounced strength In sterling
exchange -u-uuscu an expectation I" some quar
ters of exports of gold, but although opinion
as to the probability of this was divided there
were enormous sales of both accounts in the
market. Money ranged up to 8 per cent, but
closed at half that figure. The sales by Lon
don of copper stocks recently was one reason
for the strength of sterling exchange, but the
more Immediate cause was the transfer of the
Spanish Indemnity warrants for 120.000,000 to the
representative of Spain, who was reported to
have called for instructions as to the matter
of transferring the funis to Spain. This gave
color to the rumor that the transfer had not
been anticipated in the sterling exchange mar
ket, but this, of course, was pure conjecture.
Some authorities were of the opinion that
sterling exchange was unlikely to advance to
a point which would make the lead exports
profitable. While such action might arise
within the next two months there wen those
of the opinion that the recurrence of the neces
sity to finance Industrial consolidations, for In
stance that of the Amalgamated Copper Com
pany, this week would maintain money at a
rate which -would make ll more profitable to
leave the gold here rather than ship in any
quantity abroad. â -.'.
Among the extreme declines which early un
settled the list the local shares were most
prominent, including Consolidated Gas, 14',;
Metropolitan, 12%: Third Avenue, 9; Manhattan,
6 *. and Brooklyn Transit. 6',i. The decline In
gas shares was accompanied by the announce
ment of a cut in prices. Other prominent de
clines were New York' Air Brake, 17. Sugar,
<Â»Â»; Federal Steel, 7: American Tobacco, 5;
Anaconda Mining. 4.J; International Silver,
4* 4 . Continental Tobacco, 4%, and American
Steel and National Steel. 4 each. There wa3
also pronounced weakness in People's Gas.
Tennessee Coal and practically all of the In
dustrials. From the extreme depression there
were but few recoveries, among which was Air
Brake "'â¢; and Metropolitan, Sugar and Third
Avenue over a point each. Among the rail
ways the losses ranged up to 4% in Northwest,
with the average elsewhere about 2. The fresh
outbreak on liquidation toward the close was
associated with the strength of money. To
day being a bank holiday in London there was
no indication of the attitude of foreign specu- i
lators in the local market. Hallway mortgages
participated in the weakness of the day, but
concessions were mainly unimportant.
United States old 4's coupon declined ,i and
do registered and the s's % in the bid price.

FOR MRS. NOLAN
Col. Compton Before
Court-Martial.
SOME DAMAGING TESTIMONY
THOSE CHECKS CUT BUT VERY
LITTLE FIGURE.
Evidence of the Prosecution All Ln
and the Defense Will Now
Have a Chance to Be
Heard.
The testimony against Lieutenant Neail
is all in, and to-morrow his defense will
open. Colonel Compton, commanding the
Fourth Cavalry, was the lasl witness of
importance, and his testimony was direct
uui unsparing. 11. said Neall had will
lully deceived him when there was no
cause for his deception and al! the ques
tions from the defense could not alter
the tone of his evidence.
Colonel Compton was called to testify
to the events of tiie post exchange trans
fer ami the non-payment of the dividends.
His evidence was given in.support of thej
charge of conduct unbecoming an officer
ar.d a gentleman.
Early in February Compton hud called
Neall to his offlce and had Inquired why
it was there had been no dividends from
the post exchange. Neall told him there j
were certain checks among the assets
of tiie exchnn/.e and these had to be |
s:er.*'ii by Mrs. Nolan, as administratrix, j
of her husband's estate, as they had been
made payable to Lieutenant Nolan while j
.':â¢â¢ had been in charge of the exchange. |
Neai! was also asked about the turning
over of tii*' affairs of the exchange to
Lieutenant Slavens; who had been ordered
to succeed him! and lie gave the same ex- I
cuse as a reason for not complying with j
the order. Colonel Compton took this j
excuse as a good one. Later on he had '
another talk with Neall on the same sub- !
ject, and Neall gave him to understand
that the affairs of the exchange ere still
in the same position: also that he had
found it impossible to secure the indorse
ment of Mi - Nolan.
These explanations'. ' impton said,
seem*-d to him to be plausible, until he
learned that Neall was short $3500 in his
accounts, and then his investigations
showed him that lie had been deceived.
On N'eali's disappearance i .ompton made
an examination of the post exchange and
found about ?12<X) in the safe. The stew
ard gave him $200 more and there were
cheeks enough over that to bring the total
amount up to over SI7OO. Of the $300 in
cheeks there was about $200 represented
by the cheeks which required the signa
ture of Mrs. Nolan.
"What was then your opinion of the
excuse made hy Lieutenant Neall for not
paying th*' dividends and turning over the
exchange?" was asked of the witness by
the judge advocate, and he answered, "I
believed it was made because he did not
have the mor.ey to turn over."
"Why do you regard his statement as
a falsehood?"
"Because his bonks showed he should
have had about $4900 on hand, and there
was no reason why he should not have
paid the dividends less the $200 repre
sented by the checks that needed to be
signed hy Mrs. Nolan."
Continuing, Colonel * lompton told how
on the morning of March 1!Â» Neall came
to him and said he wished to report back |
from ahsence without leave. He was
told that the mere reporting hack did not
end the matter, and then he -. is told of
the shortages that had been found, and
was asked if he was ready to make resti
tution. He said he was. and then Lieu
tenant Harris, the adjutant. Lieutenant
M* Nair, who succeeded liim as treasurer
of the clv!*; Lieutenant Slaveris, who suc
ceeded him in charge of the exchange,
and Lieutenant Walker, who succeeded
him in command of his troop, were
called in. and each reported the shortage i
in his own department and Lieutenant !
Neall made it good. !
Colonel Compton said further that the
checks needing Mrs. Nolan's signature
could just as well have been turned over
to Lieutenant Slavens when the order di
recting the transfer of the exchange was
made as later, when they were turned
over after Neall had disappeared.
Herman Loeth, the hospital steward.
was recalled to tell that he knew of no
prescription which had been mad.- out
foi- Lieutenant Neall by Dr. Edie, and
then he cave place to Edward Wallace,
steward of the post exchange, who was
wanted ti tell of the transactions of the
exchange before ami just after Neall took
charge. His testimony showed that Neall
was not attentive in his. supervision. He
said further, however, that from the
books it was possible to gain an accur
ate statement of the (fairs of the ex
change. This was a lift for the defense
in its effort to show that all's fault
was neglect under pressure of his duties,
not any real wrong.

GRAPE-NUTS.
A TRUE BRAIN
Can Be Built by the Right Materials.
The statement is made and is sus-
ceptible of proof that brains are built
somewhat as a wall or house is built
nf certain defined and well understood
things.
Wood may be the principal and larg-
est article in a house, but it cannot be
formed Into a house without the nails,
bolts or screws to hold it in shape.
We know that albumen Is the bulkiest
thing used by Nature in building a
human brain; but albumen alone does
not make a brain. It requires the
small [.articles of Phosphate of Potash
(like the nails in the house) to form the
albumen Into what is known as gray
matter in brain and nerve tissue.
The albumen exists in large quanti-
ties in a variety of food.
The Phosphate of Potash is found in
its truest form in certain parts of field
grains. When a man shows brain fag,
or a woman shows nervous symptoms,
it is prima facia evidence that the
Phosphate of Potash is used up faster
than the food supplies it. Therefore
cither quit' the worrying work or get
food Strong in the natural Phosphate
of Potash, to more quickly and. surely
replace the daily loss.
That is the especial errand of the
famous food, Grape-Nuts.
Good, sturdy nerves, and a healthy,
active, tireless brain, will make a man
rich where he is sure to fail when the
brain Is unable to carry out the be-
hests of the mind.
Remember that Phosphate of Potash
as a drug. will not do, for Nature takes
kindly only to such body builders when
presented in food as prepared in
Dame Nature's own laboratory.
Grape-Nuts are to be found in all
first-class groceries, and once tried
the delicious flavor will never be for-
gotten, while the feeling of increased
strength and vigor of : brain and i
nerves will tell its own tale. j
FUMIGATION
VERY BAD FOR
LEATHER GOODS
Crews of Transports
Find That Out.
SHOES, BELTS, HATS RUINED
VALISE AND ITS VALUABLE
CONTENTS DISAPPEAR.
Sick Soldiers From the Grant and
Sherman Landed at Folsom-
St.tot Wharf and Sent
to the Presidio.
The United States transport Sherman
was released from quarantine yesterday
and was docked at Folsom street wharf
by the tug Fearless. The big steamer was
covered with bunting, hut she did not
make any braver showing than did the
smaller craft that brought her across the
bay. The Sherman was not detained ln
quarantine because the case of sickness
thai had occurred on board was over
fourteen days old and there was very lit
tle fear of infection. In the case of the
Grant, however, it was different, as the
victim of smallpox only died a few days
before the ship reached port. The Grant,
therefore, will be detained at Angel Isl
and until Monday next.
There is a vigorous "kick" from the
crew of the Sherman over the manner in
which their belongings were fumigated.
The quarantine officials assert that the !
men were warned not to put any leather
goods among the articles to be fumigated,
and the members of the crew assert that
no such order was issued. Be that which
ever way it may, one thing is certain, and
that is over half the crew of the Sherman j
had to walk from the fumigating house
back to the steamer barefooted. Many of
the men had taken advantage of the op
portunity to buy "cheap shoes" (thai Is,
Srst-class shoes made by cheap labor) in
Nagasaki, and these went in with their
baggage and came out worthless. Sweat
bands were eaten off hats, pocketbooks
were ruined and leather belts were turned
Into a crisp mass.
"I wear a No. 7 shoe," Bald A. C. Mont
gomery yesterday, "hut do you think I
could pet my foot into that thing? That
pair cost me $7 in Nagasaki. They are
hand-sewed and of the best material, but
now a child could not get its foot into
them. They are shrunk to a third of their
size and are not worth 5 cents. I had a
cloth belt with leather pockets in it. The
pockets are all shriveled tip and the belt
is useless. One of the soldier boys sent
his purse to be fumigated by mistake.
When the purse came back the soldier had
to cut his money out of it. Well, we're all
out and injured, but I guess that's all the
quarantine officials care."
While the Sherman's passengers were
getting their baggage examined on the
wharf one of them missed ' a valuable

valise and the police were called in. Ev
ery portion of the wharf and the vehi
cles on it were overhauled and. the
steamer was searched from stem to stern,
but no trace of the valise or Its contents
could be found.
As soon as the Sherman was tied up i
alongside the wharf J. A. Cruickshank
had his belongings taken ashore by the
cabin boy. One valise he was particu- <
larly careful of. because in it was a rare
collection of Spanish coins, secured at
great expense in Manila; a number of
curios and a very valuable collection of
odds and ends from the battle-fields and
other places in the Philippines. Mr.
Cruickshank had occasion to go back
aboard the transport, and when he re
turned to the wharf the valise was gone
Officers Shaw and Ellis of the Harbor po
lice were called in. but the valise had
vanished and a most diligent search re
vealed no trace of it. The customs
searchers were called in and they also
went over the transport carefully, but
without result. Mr. Cruickshank must

Q afternoon. Q
+ "At your old tricks again?" asked Ryan, who recognized the visitor as +
v William Kidney, a confirmed thief. O
X "Don't be too hard on me," pleaded the self-confessed thief. "I stole a X

O Ryan and ODea took Kidney to the second-hand store where he claimed 0

Â£* "I told yon I had stolen the mattress, and here it is." /7 ? J.

O About a year ago Kidney robbed a friend of $60 worth of clothing, which X

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY Â«2, 1899.
NEW COMMANDER FOR
KNIGHTS TEMPLAR.
'
>JoÂ§epl? C. Campbell Elected to Preside?
. Over* Golden Sate Commandery. I
LAST night there was an attendance of about 120 members and several
visitors at the stated assembly of Golden Gate Commandery No. 16,
Knights Templar, in Golden Gate Asylum. The principal business of
the evening was the election of officers for the ensuing term. Joseph
C. Campbell of Reddy, Campbell & Metson was elected eminent com
mander to succeed Charles L. Patton. and the other officers chosen are:
Robert McMillan, generalissimo; Harvey D. Loveland, captain general; R. B.
Moore, senior warden; R. W. Campbell, junior warden; 11. .1. Sadler, treas
urer, and William T. Fonda, recorder. The most prominent of the visitors
was Right Eminent Grand Commander John F. Merrill.
After the close of the business there was an adjournment to the banquet
hall, where a choice collation was served and there was speaking in an in
formal way. brief addresses being made by Sir Knight Merrill, the officers
elect and the incumbents. The new officers will be Installed on the -2d inst.
now possess his soul in. patience and trust
to time to bring forth new develop
ments.
Although the Grant is in quarantine a
number of sick soldiers were brought
ashore from her during the day. They
presented a very pathetic contrast to
the holiday attire or the other ships as
they moved about the wharf, some with
their arms in slings, some on crutches
and all more or less emaciated. Among
those who were landed by the steamer
McDowell were Sergeant W. N. Kelly of
Company B, First California; Corporal
Ormo, First Tennessee; Henry W. Coul
ter, Tenth Pennsylvania; Edward T. For
tier, John Kenworth and Harry Dyer,
Thirteenth Minnesota; Clyde A. Heuter
and Leo M. Foster, Fourteenth Infantry:
Horace E. Cooladge and J. dm Donnellen,
Utah Battery"; Thomas Barkly and Clar
ence P. Bates, Tennessee, and Harry
Raphold, Twenty-third Infantry. Ambu
lances from the Presidio were awaiting
them, and as soon as matters could be
straightened out they were removed to
the hosptlal.
Sergeant Kelly says the California boys
are all well and enjoying themselves.
Th*- majority of them are at Negros, but
the battalion to which he belongs is at
Bacolod. The natives were very friendly
when Kelly left, but an outbreak at
Panay was feared. Kelly's relatives were
down to meet him- fact all the sick
men had friends to welcome them home,

GAS REDUCED TO
SIXTY-FIVE CENTS
Consumers Benefit by the War Waged
Between Rival New York
Companies.
NEW YORK, May I.â The New York
Mutual Gas Light Company to-day gave
notice thai the price of gas to all Its con
sumers had been reduced from $1 10 to 65
cents per thousand feet. The Consolidated
Gas Company also announced a similar
reduction.
William P. Purdy, as the secretary of
the New York Mutual Gas Company, ad
mitted that the reduction was the result
of a war between the Standard Gas Com
pany and the Consolidated Gas Company
and its ally, the Mutual Gas Light Com
pany.
"It is the outcome," said he. "of the
war that has been waged against the
Mutual Company and the Consolidated
Company since the Ist of December by
the other companies. The Mutual Com
pany is going to do as well by its cus
tomers as any other company for its
patrons. The proposed municipal owner
ship of gas .plants has nothing to do with
the cut. It is simply a question of light."
As a result of the rate war Consolidated
gas stock declined thirteen points on the
Stock Exchange, where almost 22,000
shares were dealt In. The other local gas
stocks are not listed on the Stock Ex
change.
There were rumors that the Standard
Gas Company would reduce its rates, but
at the office of the president, Russell
Sage, this was denied.

PHILADELPHIA, May 1. â Dewey
day was celebrated in this city with im
posing pomp and ceremony. Governor
Stone, by proclamation, made the day
a holiday in this State on the recom
mendation of the Legislature. He was
not invested with the power to make
j the event continuous, so greater efforts
were extended to render the exercises
i the more auspicious. Public institutions
; were open for business as usual.
The most important event was the
< naval parade on the Delaware River,
which was reviewed by naval and civic
dignitaries. The harbor presented a
I beautiful spectacle, innumerable flags
and. white bunting, entwined with the
! city colors, blue and gold, being dis
j played in profusion on hundreds of ves
sels. The buildings along the river
front and throughout the city were
i gaily decorated.
The cruiser Raleigh was the chief
object of interest. The warship was
anchored at the extreme turning point
of the line of the naval parade. Next
to her was the revenue cutter Algon
quin and all the available craft were
assembled at League Island.
All the vessels to participate in the
pageant started at a signal from the
navy yard from a point a short distance
below League Island. The parade pro
ceeded up the Delaware River, passing
the Raleigh, Captain Coghlan re
viewing the procession from the bridge
of the warship. As the head of the
procession reached the Raleigh the
cruiser fired the national salute, and
then until the last vessel in the parade
had repassed over on the west side of
the river the salutes from. the Raleigh
were almost continuous.
The Russian naval officers who are
here superintending the construction of
the new Russian warships at Cramps'
participated'"'in the ceremonies, review
ing the parade with Captain Coghlan.
Throughout the State celebrations
were being held in honor of the hero
of Manila Bay.

NEW YORK, May I.â President and

The Presidential party, which included
General Dodge, W. W. Wheaton, Sergeant
Rixey, U. S. N.. and Colonel W. C. Brown,
were received on board the Government
tug Nina by Commander J. D. J. Kelly, U.
S. N.,who was delegated to escort them to
the navy-yard by Rear Admiral J. W.
Philip. .The tug reached the yard at 10:10
o'clock and the visitors landed at the foot
of Main street. As the Nina turned into
the Wallabout Basin the guns on board
the Vermont belched forth a salute of
twenty-one guns in honor of the Presi
dent. Rear Admiral Philip, with Captains
Miller, Ide, Farnholdt and Arnold, greeted
the President and his escort when they
came ashore.
President McKinley and the command
ant then led up the yard to the Lyceum
building, in front of which all the officers
on duty at the yard were lined up in full
dress. One hundred marines in command
of Colonel R. W. Huntington faced the
building. As the party approached the
Marine Band played "Hail to the Chief,
and while the marines presented arms, the
officers and spectators doffed their hats.
Admiral Philip introduced each of the
officers to the President, who shook hands
with every one of them. After this the
party was escorted through the stores and
factories and then visited the Yosemite
and Glacier, which they inspected. After
the inspection they were invited to lunch
eon at the commandant's residence.
After luncheon the President and the
other visitors returned to the city on
hoard the Nina, and as the vessel swung
into the East River another salute Of
twenty-one guns was fired from the Ver
mont, on which vessel the President s flag
was flying. ___
SECRETARY LONG'S SPEECH.
He Defends the Policy of the Admin
istration.
BOSTON, May I.â The Essex Club cele
brated Admiral" Dewey's victory 'with a
i banquet at Young's Hotel to-day, at which
j were entertained as guests Secretary of
the Navy Long and two heroes of the
Manila fight, Captain Wildes of the Bos
ton and Lieutenant Commander Reese,
form* rly executive officer of the Olym
pia, besides Command. James R. Self
ridge, formerly of th.- Puritan, and Lieu
tenant Commander F. A. Wilmer.of the
Monadnock.
Secretary Long began ids speech with
a eulogy to Admiral Dewey, and then
paid a graceful tribute to the officers and
the men of the navy. The greater part
of his speech was a defense of the na
tional administration's Philippine policy.
He said in part: ; .
"I believe thai no more unpatriotic ut
terance, or one more unjust to the ad
ministration of the Government of our
country, has been uttered than the state
ment which I see now and then that 'the
treatment of Cubans by Spain, or the
Armenians by the Turks, is not to be
compared with our course toward the Fil
ipinos in wanton and deliberate cruelty.
The mind that can utter such an extrav
-1 agance is so entirely warped that its
judgment Is valueless."
At Chicago.
CHICAGO, May The celebration of
Dewey day was mostly of an indoor char
acter. In a majority of the schools an

tainments were given, including an "ex

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syrui- of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal' qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please

She Objects Most Strenuously to
Being Divorced After She Has
Been Reunited to Her
Husband.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, May 1.
Mme. Florence Montague- Yates has
caused a Butter among Oakland spirit
ualists by sending word that she will
shortly return and make it warm for
certain people who have forced her to
obtain a divorce from her husband;
The recent letter from Mme. Montague
states that she is in England, where she
went soon after leaving Oakland. She is
exceedingly annoyed with the notoriety
she has met with and which has preceded
her to Europe.
The madame says that the action of
her Oakland friends has entirely misrep
resented her in the eyes of thousands
of people, and thing will satisfy her
but a complete vindication .Mrs. Mon
tague was divorced after her departure
from this city, and after the divorce was
granted she wrote out 1 hat she was living
with her husband, to whom she had. been
reunited in Montreal. She also said that
she had ordered that the proceedings lie
canceled and hat the matter be dropped.
Certain people in Oakland, however, were
determined that the madame should be
divorced, and they paid for the costs of
the litigation.
.lust what the madame will do is proble
matical. The decree is corded, and yet
she says that she did not desire it, is re
united to her husband and was a victim
of others. It is expected that Mme. Mon
tague will return to the coast In about
six weeks.

i fin- a brief period this afternoon, pre
j sumably at the instance of her husband,
but the scene she created, accompanied
i by pitiful screams, resulted in her hus
band relenting and she was soon re
leased. : y
Now she charges Insane Keeper Keat
ing with depriving her of her liberty
without warrant or good cause, and will
bring the attention of the Supervisors to
his alleged unwarranted haste.
Mr. and Mrs Colgett called at the lb
ceiving Hospital shortly after _ o'clock.
The husband handed the keeper of the in
sane a letter from Dr. W. P. Mauzy in
forming him that "this is the case 1
spoke to you about a month ago." The
trio then walked Into the insane ward,
and the keeper, with Mr. Golgett, quickly
left the room, turning the key and leav
ing Mrs. Colgett imprisoned.
"Papa, papa, open that door for God's
J Bake!" cried the woman, beating with all
her might against the door at the same
time. Her screams interrupted the con
sultation her husband and the Insane
Keeper were holding in th*- ball, and re
suited finally in her release. As she
stepped out her face was white with
rage, and she realized apparently the po
sition in which she had been placed, and
she did not propose to be railroaded to
an Insane asylum summarily.
"This is an outrage to society," said
Mrs. Colgett; "and 1 do not propose to
stand it. 1 shall report this matter to the
Supervisors. The idea of suggesting
that I be locked in that room over night.
Why, I would lose my reason. 1 supposed
that I was to come here to be exam
ined by some physician to see what
could be done for the nervous troubl*
from which 1 have been suffering. Such
cruel treatment never was heard of be
fore," and she requested her husband to
accompany her home instanter.
Insane Keeper Keating, smarting under
the woman's rebuke, turned to the hus- j
band and â¢ remarked with anger, "The '
next time you want us to do something
for you. you ought to know what you j
want, and don't come here and make a
fool of me."- Keating's explanation to
the woman â that he had turned the key
in order to hold a consultation with her
husband privately, did not work as a sol
ace, and she insists thai lie shall be re
moved from his position.
"1 have suffered from nervous troubles
the past year," said Mrs. Colgett after j
the scene, "and 1 become very fidgety at
times, but I have never been violent, to
all of which her husband assentlngly
nodded. i
Dr. Mauzy, Mrs. Colgett's physician,
when asked as to tie- woman's mental
condition; manifested reticence. "1 do
not .are to talk about it. It is all a ques
tion of opinion. It is a private case, and
might as well be dropped right now."
insane Keeper Keattng's discomfiture
over tiie incident was great. "I talked
with Dr. Mauzy a month ago about this
very case," said he. "1 was justified in
doing what I did. Mi-. Colgett came with
this letter. He claims she tried to kill
him 0n..-. She couldn't be examined to
day, anyway, so 1 was going to hold her
until to-morrow, but her husband weak
ened, If she had been given a dose of
â¢dope,' or something, we could have held
her here and she would have been quiet."
Mrs. Colgett's husband is a gardener
by occupation, and they have a family of
grown-up children, who will no doubt
lake somebody to task for their mother's
treatment.
The methods in vogue in the insane
wards at the Receiving Hospital were
lately inquired into by the Grand Jury
with considerable scrutiny. The inquisi
torial body meets again next "Wednesday,
ami it is likely thai a partial report will
be forthcoming.
Injured by a Toy Cannon.
OAKLAND, May I.â A juvenile attempt
at a miniature reproduction of Admiral
Dewey's naval feat of a year ago almost '
resulted disastrously to-day, when little
Willie Zabel. aged li years, residing at 660
('lay street, was the "man behind the can
non." Zabel and sonic other boys were
imaginarily bombarding the Philippines
with a toy cannon. At one stage the can- â 
non did not discharge with the desired
promptness and young Zabel looked close
ly into the fuse-hole to see what the
matter was. when the deceptive gun ex
ploded, nearly putting out his left eye. At
the Receiving Hospital Dr. Stratton and
Oculist Thomas attended to his injuries,
and it is feared he may lose the sight of
the damaged eye.

THE THEATERS
By Ashton Stevens.
T\Hl-. Woman Hater," the farce by
David D. Lloyd In which Roland
Reed commenced his second and
last week in the Columbia Theater
last night, is not new to the play
goers of San Francisco. Mr. Reed has
played it here before, and unless 1 am
badly mistaken a local stock com
pany essayed it not very long ago. It
is a farce of no particular novelty. The
woman hater, you are soon given to
understand, is not that at all. but a
veritable Romeo In middle age. who
tin*. ugh misunderstanding and comic
circumstance becomes engaged to no
less than three bouncing widows. He
extricates himself by means of the old
insanity dodge, but winds up in an
asylum, from which he finally emerges
with the woman of his choice.
The first two acts are slow, even un
interrupted by applause, as they were
last night; but the third, which reveal
some rather ingenious complications in
the capture of the woman hater by the
attendants from the asylum, and the
fourth, which shows him fuming in
captivity, mistaking his friends and
fiancees for lunatics, are much funnier,
if indeed they offer little that has not
been done as well and better by other
play writers.
Mr. Reed, throws himself earnestly
into the principal part. Earnestness,
strange as it may sound, is just the
quality that is needed in the principal
aits of most farces. The character
is usually the victim of circumstances,
and the more complicated these become
and the more dead-in-earnest the
amazement ami resentment he meets
them with, the more ludicrous the ef
fect. Unfortunately Mr. Reed's part in
"The Woman Hater" is marred by an
abundance of knowing soliloquy's and
asides that make this mode of treat
ment not always possible. Much of the
time he is engaged in explaining things
to the audience I have noticed that
th.- best plays are those that the audi
ences find out for themselves. Miss
Rush and the other members of the
company furnish a well-ensembled if
not individually notable support.
That this is the last week of Miss Lil
lian Burkhart's engagement at the
orpheum is a matter of regret, not only
to the regular patrons of this vaude
ville theater, but to all admirers of re
fined and distinguished comedy acting.
The fourth week at the Orpheum, and
yet this remarkable young woman is
now, as she was at the first, the best
and most artistic personality in the the
aters of San Francisco! The Orpheum
has given house to many enviable rec
ords, but to none better than this le
gitimate one of Miss Burkhart. I can
think of no finer triumph for any act
ress than to grip the attention of the
Orpheum-goers for four consecutive
weeks, as Miss Burkhart has done, in a
class of work that has little if any nat
ural place in the go-as-you-please of
vaudeville. She has resorted to no vul
garity, to no extreme personal display,
to thing in fact but the cleanest and
keenest of legitimate craftsmanship.
And she has held the attention and ad
miration of all, from the casual play
goer of cultivation who drifted into the
orchestra to the toughest god of the
Sunday-night gallery. Her work will
leave a fragrant memory, a wholesome
tradition for the house that had the
good sense to risk a month of her deli
cacy and refinement. Whether Miss
Burkhart comes back to us as a vaude
ville star, or, as many of . us would
hope, a principal actress in a full
fledged play, her welcome is assured.
This week's piece is an adaptation
from the French of Eugene Pierron
and Adolph Lafferrier, entitled "My
Aunt's Advice;" I have seen the play
somewhere under another name. It
tells of a young bride who, to rid the
house of her husband's chum, pretends
love for him. He discovers the letter
from her aunt which suggested the
hoax, and returns her affected passion
with unexpected good will. The hus
band challenges, and there is a lot of
excitement before the general explana
tion. The dialogue is rather formal ami
Miss Burkhart has fewer individual
chances than in her other plays, but
nevertheless she gets a deal of graceful
fun out of the part and pays another
distinct tribute to her apparently limit
less versatility. Mr. J. K. Macurdy, as
the friend, is still inclined to â¢ fierce
facialism and a vast wobbling of the
eye and a disesteem for real, effortless
humor, but on the whole he is much
easier than in the other plays. The one
disaster is the husband, played by a
Mr. Tracy, who in speech, feature and
action bears a fatal resemblance to
Mr. Jeffries the pugilist.

CHINESE SLAVE TRAFFIC.
I The regular meeting of the Occidental
| Board of Foreign Missions was held in
j the Mission-house on Sacramento street
yesterday afternoon. In honor of the
j day the Chinese children all wore Ameri
can flags and . opened the exercises by
. singing "My Country, 'Tis of Thee," and
I the "Battle Hymn of the Republic." A
I little Chinese girl played the accompani
ment to both songs on the piano.
Rev. Mr. Miller, a returned missionary
! from Korea, spoke on conditions in that
! country. He said that the -work of the
| missionaries is growing greater every
I year and the field is always open for more
! earnest workers.
Rev. Mr. Ellis, formerly of Boston, but
1 now of this city, read a letter from the
' American Purity Alliance, giving statis
tics in regard to the manner in which the
slave raffia, in Chinese women is carried
on. The Alliance will meet 'In London
next June, and the subject will be taken
iup there and thoroughly discussed. In
the meanwhile the Occidental Board will

with that class of so-called "mediums"- that
invest every city in this country. Without
asking a single question he reveals your
past, present and future life, calling your
friends and enemies by full name. He helps
the unfortunate and lends his power (which
Is stronger than that of any medium now
In San Francisco) to help every caller to
succeed in the realization of their desires.
Unhappy lovers, unsuccessful business men.
those inflicted with so-called "Incurable"
diseases, will find Professor Dubois a true
friend who will set them aright and help
them to their success and happiness.
No matter what your trouble may be, con-
sult Professor Dubois and you will depart
thoroughly satisfied that there is at least
one reliable medium now In your city.
Professor Dubois' charges are moderate,
and within the reach of all. The small fee
of $1 charged on all consultations. Daily
and Sunday, 10 a. m. to 7 p. m. Absolute
satisfaction guaranteed. Letters must con-
tain $1 If answer is expected. Palmistry

f we heard a lady say once, "I like Mrs. B. ; the more I know her the better I like her, ' and we want you to say the same trfrng when you talk about Hale's ; and Hale's is probably the most talked-about dry-goods store in this city :we like you to know usâ not just a nodding
acquaintance, but a friendship : not just on your catual visiting list, but treat us as one of the family, and, like everything and everybody else that is close to your family circle, you should know us well : that's one reason why we often speak in a personal way to you : lots of y
economical women remember when Hale's opened up on this spot seven years ago to-day: they've watched our progress and kept up a close acquaintance with us : over thirty thousand folks are regular correspondents of ours â thirty thousand folks who live out of the city and â -- W
many of them never saw our store : you who live in San Francisco get a letter from us every day in the morning papers : we say to you now, come and participate in a whole week of birthday celebration : see how neighborly we really are : see how reasonable "good goods'' can I '
be sold at : let us know you better for our mutual satisfaction, 1

ALL HEADS AT
THE UNIVERSITY
TO COME OFF
General Reorganiza- !
tion Decided Upon.
BIG SALARY FOR PRESIDENT
HE WILL GET TEN THOUSAND
DOLLARS A YEAR.
WiU Be Expected to Engage a
New Staff of Assistants
and Infuse New
Blood.
The regents of the University of Cali
fornia have not fully determined what
compensation the president of, the insti
tution of learning at Berkeley shall re
ceive under the new and liberal order of
things in prospect, but the sum of $10,000
per annum is so frequently mentioned
that many who are interested in the
change accept that figure as an approxi
mation of the salary. Doubtless the re
gents have exchanged views on the sub
ject, and the promoters of liberal com
pensation reached the conclusion that the
figure named will be acceptable to a ma
jority of the board.
The most enlightened and zealous
friends of the university on the Board of
Regents do not expect that all the de
sired reforms at Berkeley will be brought
about by a change In the presidency of
the institution. Other changes must fol
low in order to obtain the advancement
so long sought. There is a deal of dead
timber in the subordinate chairs that
must be disposed of in some fashion. It is
acknowledged that some of the professors
are useful and progressive, but it cannot
be disputed by the most enthusiastic ad
mirers of the faculty that professors who
ought to be pensioned and retired are re
tained. â¢
It is said that an Eastern man, whose
learning and executive ability commanded
the attention of the regents, was con
sulted as to what plans should be adopted
to eliminate tin- undesirable professors.
He suggested that the new president
should be assured that all the professors
would resign at the end of the year. The
suggestion meets with favor. It may not
follow that a sweeping, radical change all
along the line of subordinate Instruction
would result from the adoption of this
plan, but the new president's task of in
troducing modern methods of education
would be lightened if be were left per
fectly free to select ins coworkers. Capa
ble men, now out of place, might be as
signed to positions where they would be
able to render excellent service in build
ing up the Institution. Men who never
were of any use to the university and
others who have outlived their usefulness
as Instructors could be disposed of with
out public comment or embarrassment to
the president.
The college professors at Berkeley
have not quite given up the hope or the
fear that one of their own set "will be
chosen to succeed Mr. Kellogg. The re
port that the regents have about de
cided to offer the presidency to Professor
Wheeler of Cornell Is not credited by the
friends of William Cary Jones. The in
fluences behind Jones are said to be pow
erful and persuasive.
â  The new regents, including Stephen M.
White of Los Angeles, A. B. Spreckels,
president of the State Agricultural So
ciety; Jacob H. Nefl, Lieutenant Gover
nor; Alden Anderson, Speaker of the As
sembly, and Governor Henry T.Gage, will
participate in the election of President
Kellogg's successor. It would not He sur
prising if White and Gage came up from
the south with a candidate of their own.
it would not be the first time that South
ern California introduced a new man for
a good salary.
The regents are not making haste in
the selection of a new president. The de
cision was reached three years ago that
Mr. Kellogg should retire, but it was
deemed best to withhold the fact from
the public until the Legislature of 1597
adjourned sine die. Long after adjourn
ment the acceptance of President Kel
logg's resignation was 'announced, and
then it was decided to defer the election
of his successor until the Legislature of
1899 adjourned. At the rate of progress
already Indicated the new president will
li* elected about the time the present cen
tury expires.
ARREST OF A PICKPOCKET.
How James Green Celebrated Dewey
Day at Glen Park at Others'
Expense.
A gang of pickpockets took advantage
of the gathering of patriotic citizens at
Glen Park yesterday to ply their vocation
by getting away with other people's prop
erty. Among the number of light-fingered
individuals noticed by the police was
James Green, whose record is well
known to the detective department at the
City Hall. Green was seen by Officers J.
F. Edner, C. H. Taylor and Horace G.
White of the Seventeenth-street station,
who had been detailed by Captain James
W. Gillin to look out for such characters.
As soon as the crowd gathered at some
particular point on the grounds Green and
three pals were seen to push their way
into the thickest of the gathering. It
required but a short time for them to
develop their calling, as two ladiesâ Mrs.
McCradie, who resides on Bernal -Heights,
and Mrs. McLearn, residing at 131 Cali
fornia avenueâ reported to â¢ the officers
that their purses, containing some money,
had been taken out of their pockets by
a young man answering the description
of Green. The officers found him, and on
being confronted with the ladles they at
once Identified him as the man who had
robbed them. He was placed under arrest
and taken to the Seventeenth-street sta
tion, where he was charged with grand
larceny. The other suspects made them
selves scarce when they saw Green- In
the clutches of the officers.
AGAINST POLYGAMY.
Dr. Paden's Address Before the Pres
byterian Ministerial Union.
At the regular weekly meeting of the
Presbyterian Ministerial Union, 920 Sacra
mento street, Dr. Paden read a criticism
yesterday morning on B. H. Roberts'
"Defense of Polygamy," an article writ
ten in the May number of the Improve
j ment Era. a Mormon magazine. The
Ladies' Occidental Board was Invited to
attend.
Dr. Paden considered the article of B.
| H. Roberts seriatim, refuting each and
! every postulate advanced. He showed
', that the Mormons are now practicing
polygamy openly. "Ever since statehood
has been acquired," he claimed, "the Mor
. 1 mon women have taken the names of
their husbands, something which Was not
formerly done."
Dr. Paden then disproved the arguments
' â¢of Roberts, which trace the justilication
of Mormonism to the Bible. "If the polyg
amy of David, Abraham and Solomon was
right It would be equally as good logic
'. to say all the other sinful and vicious
practices mentioned in the Bible were also
: right." The latter portion of Dr. Paden's
address was devoted to Solomon and' his
i many wives. _. .-

GRAND JURY
STIRRED BY
DISSENSIONS
Foreman Murdock Is
Not Popular.
CRITICISM OF HIS METHODS
â 
CREDITED WITH A LACK OF EF
FECTIVENESS.
Members Have Discussed the Advis
ability of Taking Steps Toward .
the Selection of a New-
Leader.
The complaints made last Thursday by
a number of business men who had been
summoned to appear before the Grand
Jury as witnesses and who were kept
waiting for hours before being called to
testify have had the effect of bringing to
the surface tho details of Internal dissen
sions in the Grand Jury that are held
accountable for the poor results that have
attended the work of the jury during the
past four months. Many of the members
do not want to rest under the imputation
that they have taken no Interest ln their
work when, as they claim, every effort
on their part has been nullified by the
attitude assumed by Foreman C. A. Mur
dock, whom they hold responsible for
the lack of effectiveness that has been
the chief distinguishing mark of the
acts of the Grand Jury.
| So grave, indeed, are the differences be
tween the foreman and a majority of the
members of the jury that serious discus
sion has been indulged in as to the ad
visability .of taking steps looking toward
his removal from the position of power
which was given him by Judge Dainger
field when the Jury was impaneled and
1 sworn in. That this has not been done
Is due rather to the fact that the power
j of a majority of the members to depose
i the foreman is questionable,, than to a
lack of desire on the part of those who
; believe tho work of the jury Is being
i hampered and Its effectiveness vitally im-
I paired.
Those members who consent to discuss
i the matter call attention to the investiga
tion of the affairs of the old Board of
I Education that was undertaken by the
'. Grand Jury early in the present year.
(This Investigation has amounted to" noth
ing in the way of practical results, al
though according to views held by some
of the members the opportunities afforded
for a thorough exploitation of the scan
dal were Jinllmlted. At one stage of the
investigation half a score of teachers of
both sexes who were suspected of having
paid fancy prices for their positions in
the department were required to appear
as witnesses before the jury. Foreman
Murdock, acting as inquisitor, would in
terrogate these witnesses about as fol
| lows:
"Did you pay anything for your posi
: tion as teacher In the School Depart-
I ment?" ,
"No; I .-did not."- . âi~ -\y- j
"Very well. That is satisfactory so far
I as I am concerned. You are excused." *.
1 Other members of the jury who sought
to question the witnesses with the object
in view of testing their credibility were
promptly sat upon by the foreman.
Those 'members who now question Fore
man Murdock's fitness for the position
which he occupies point to his record as
a School Director, and cite the fact that
while lie was serving as a member of the
Board of Education he handed in his res
ignation because his associates would not
act according to ins wishes. : bA,b;.'-
During the past two months such little
work as has been performed by the
Grand Jury has had the sanction of but
a bare majority of its members, and on
more than one occasion it was found
necessary to adjourn because no quorum
was present. Members have lost interest
in the work, and there is little prospect
that the future holds better results in
store unless the members are permitted
to choose a. leader whose views are more
in harmony with theirs. '
THE S. P.'S GUESTS.
Speyer and Van Home Back From \
Del Monte.
Jam. D. Speyer, who is out here from
New York reorganizing the Central Pa
cific and at the same time actively en
gaged in promoting harmony among the
occupants of the big building at Mont
gomery and Market streets, returned
yesterday from Hotel del Monte, where,
with his party, he has been a guest since
Thursday of General Hubbard and Ju
lius Kruttschnitt. >
Sir William C. Van Home,, the titled
American president of the Canadian Pa
cific Railroad, has also been a guest of
the railroad people at the Monterey ho
tel, where he and his rather numerous
party have spent the oast few days, ac
companied by J. A. Fillmore. Sir Wil
liam expects to leave soon upon ids re
turn trip, but will first take In the south
ern end of the State.
The date of Mr. Speyer's leave taking
is problematical. Now that he lias elected
his new board of directors for the Cen
tral Pacific, the last details of the gigantic
bond Issue Boon to be announced are being
arranged and it is expected that a meet
ing of the directorate will be called within
a very few days for the purpose of tak
ing definite action upon that phase of the
consolidation scheme.
ACCUSED OF ROBBERY.
James McÃride, 152 Fifth street, began
early yesterday morning to celebrate
Dewey day. Between 2 and 3 o'clock he
dropped into William .Phillips' saloon,
Fifth and Natoma streets, and took part
In a discussion as to the Importance of
the day. To back up his opinion he put
a $5 gold piece on the counter, but no one
accepted his challenge.
Phillips, he alleges, took the gold piece
and put It In his cash register, and when
McÃride demanded its return he was
laughed at. McÃride informed a police
man and Phillips was taken to the City
Prison, where a charge of robbery was
booked against him.
F. R. Hatcher, stepson of M. "Cernltore,
the old gentleman who was robbed of
$150 by Daniel Burke, -a cook, In the Simp
son House, Second and Minna streets,
Sunday night, is determined to push the
charge of robbery against Burke. Only
$115 of the money was recovered and
Burke declines to say what became of
the other $35. The old gentleman is still
suffering from the beating he received
from Burke before being robbed.

SEAL HERDS ST
POINT REYES
DRIVEN AWAY
Havoc Among the
Rookeries.
THE WORK OF TWO HUNTERS
KILLED, WOUNDED AND SCARED
BY BULLETS.
Ocean Water Reddened by the Blood
of the Fish-Killers, but Their
Bodies Went Out
to Sea.
Death reaped a great harvest at the sea
lion rookeries at Point Reyes yesterday.
The metal-jacketed bullet of the maga
zine rifle has played havoc in the large
herds of the marine animals, and the tide
off the very stormy headland is strewn
with their lifeless carcasses. For some
time past this has been contemplated by
the State Board of Fish and Game Com
missioners, who believed that by thinning
out the herds the fisheries industries of
this locality would be more protected
from the ravages of the beasts. On Fri
day morning Deputy Al Wilson and a
companion started for the rookeries to
slaughter the seals. Upon arriving there
they found that Mr. Wilson's former trip
in February had had some effect. On
that occasion he killed about 150 of the
beasts, and the remainder were somewhat
timid at the report of a rifle.
At any rate, there were fewer than
when he was there before, but still
enough to make the hunting interesting.
It had been supposed that the seals were
in the habit of going to these rookeries
to bring forth their young, but inquiry
leads to the belief that the^Farallones are
the favorite breeding grounds and that
the old sea lions take their young to the
Point Reyes rookeries as soon as they
are able to master the waves. In order to
destroy as many of the fish-killers as
possible it was necessary to look over the
ground before beginning the work of kill
ing. Mr. Wilson recognized at once that
conditions were different from what they
were when he was there before, and two
days were consumed in going over the
rocky cliffs. This is by no means an easy
task. The point is situated on the ex
treme end of the peninsula that projects
out Into the ocean about eight miles from
the line of the mainland. .
The face of the point extends about
three miles northwest and southeast. It
is a wild cliff that, rises out of the ocean
to a height of about 600 feet. At the foot
of this cliff on the northern end the
rookeries are located on ledges and
shelves from ten to twenty feet above
the water. There are but few places
where even the most daring hunter would
venture a descent, for a single misstep
would hurl him down hundreds of feet
upon the jagged rocks over which the
breakers dash Incessantly. As stated, the
first days were devoted to finding a place
where access could be had to these rocks,
near the water, and where : the hunters
could do execution with their firearms.
On . Saturday they found a place where
the animals frequented, and there some
shooting was done and a number were
killed, but not as many as was expected.
it was decided that it would be best to
avoid firing upon the rookeries as long as
possible, because to do so would scatter
the sea lions. At last a desirable loca
tion was found, but to reach it was dan
gerous. Yesterday morning after a
hearty breakfast at the dairy farm of R.
E. Dickson, where the hunters were ac
commodated in fine style, they sallied
forth. After a walk of half an hour they
reached the Government lands on which
the lighthouse and signal station is lo
cated, and began the descent to the wa
ter's edge. A part of the way was down
a rickety ladder, placed there by some
adventurous fisherman, but long out of
use. This is thirty feet long, and below
the rocks are as treacherous as the lad
der, only small shelves projecting to af
ford an unsatisfactory foothold. With
pockets filled with ammunition and rifles
strapped to their backs the men care
fully worked their way down the face of
the cliff, a high gale threatening to dash
them to the depths below every moment.
The descent required fifteen minutes, but
at last a safe footing was obtained near
the water, close to one of the small reefs
around which the seals had to pass on
their way from the Ashing grounds on
the south reef to the rookeries. The hunt
ers crouched behind a small rock to be
sheltered from the wind, but not from the
spray and spume of the sea, which
dashed over them with every roller of the
Pacific.
As the sea lions passed by their appear
ance at the surface was met with a sharp I
report of one or both rifles. Where the
shots were instantly fatal the large
beasts stretched out on the water witnout
a movement, but where the bullets failed
to find the vital spot the commotion was
terrific. The wounded creatures .would
bellow, thrash and flounder â¢ violently,
spouting great streams of blood, for the
animals are very full blooded, and a
wounded sea lion will redden the sea for
yards around. It is safe to say that not
one of the wounded escaped, their very
exertions accomplishing all that the bul
lets failed in. Besides, one of the rifles
shot half metal jacketed soft pointed bul
lets, that expand on coming in contact
with a solid of any kind, and the ex
panded points tore great holes, that
drained the blood very rapidly.
The procession that swam to its death
was varied. Great bulls that weighed
from one ton to a ton and a half, large
cow seals with yellow bodies, . spotted
leopard seals, black barking seals and the
half-grown of all kinds afforded targets
for the hunters.
Many of the killed went to the bottom
at once, and the few that died with air in
their lungs floated out to sea, so tnat
there is but little fear that their bodies
will ever annoy the people along tne
shore. As the run along the cliff de
creased it was decided to make an on
slaught upon the rookeries proper. Gain
ing a point about 150 yards from the rook
eries, for the hunters could get no near
er, a stand was taken upon a point of
rocks in full view of the bellowing, bark
ing beasts. The rifle sights were run un
for the required elevation and a large
quantity of cartridges were placed so as
to be handy for fusillade. There were two
objective, points to be covered. On one
ledge, twelve feet from the water, lay
basking in the sun about seventy-five sea
lions. A little further to the left was a
rough rock upon which rolled and tum
bled many more. Scarcely a foot of the
rocks but were thus covered.
"Are you ready?' asked Wilson. "Turn
loose." The two rifles spoke together.
Then the reports of the two alternated,
the sharp crack of the smokeless powder
arm contrasting strangely with the louder
"bang" of the black powder rifle, It must
have been that the gale was so strong
that the reports were faint to the ears of
the sea lions, for It took them several i
minutes to comprehend that death was
swinging his scythe among them. But
they were soon alarmed by the bellowing
and barking of the wounded and by the
rolling of the dead from the rocks. Then
with. a rush the whole herd tumbled Into
the breakers and disappeared. This gave
an opportunity to replenish the nearly
empty magazines, which, by. the way, had
been emptied and filled once since the
shooting began. Even at that great dis
tance the deadly effect of the bullets was
to be seen. Large patches of blood ap
peared upon the surface of the water,
marking the location of dead or wounded.
The number of these will never be known,
for as stated the swift ocean currents
soon carried away the helpless and de-
timet. â  â¢ ..".-. , â .
No sooner were the mgnzines of the
rifles replenished than the frightened
animals began to appear on the surface
in herds of from three to two dozen and
not a few lots came to the top as thick
as a bunch of bananas, affording the
hunters a splendid chance to get a pot
shot on the lot. Not a few of the stupid
brutes crawled back to the rocks again
only to present fine targets for the de
stroyers. The amount of damage that
can be done by two men with repeaters
is astonishing. When the seals came to
the conclusion that the rocks were no
longer safe they began to swim about,
and all that remained for the hunters to
do was to secure a good place and "plunk
it" to all of the stragglers that got within
range. It is believed - that the breaking
up of the rookeries at Point Reyes will
have the effect of driving the larger part
of the herd to the Farallon Islands.
The shooting of strays will continue to
day and maybe to-morrow, when the
hunters will return to this city.
Lost a Valuable Watch.
John Devenney, 550 Natoma street, was
among the crowd that assembled In Co
lumbia Square yesterday at noon to hear
the gun fired in honor of Admiral Dewey.
He was not there long when he discovered
that his gold watch had been stolen from
his pocket. It had teen neatly slipped
off the chain. He reported his loss at
police headquarters and said he felt it
keenly as the watch was presented to him
by ex-Governor Budd at St. Patrick's
Fair about a year ago for being the most
popular Irishman in the city, and it bore
a suitable inscription.
