BRUSSELS, Feb. 20.â The Due d'Orleans arrived
suddenly this evening from Turin, with a single orderly offi
cer.
He spent the evening at a theater and appeared very
gay, though it is reported he is waiting for some Paris friends
with the intent to enter France and risk something on the
day of M. Faure's funeral. He is closely watched by private
French detectives.
Prince \ ictor Napoleon appeared annoyed on learning
of the Due d'Orleans' arrival. He believes the Duke has
some secret plan.
PARIS, Feb. 20.â Figaro publishes
this interview with Prince Henri
of Orleans on the subject of the I
votes cast for him on Saturday:
"Certainly I was not a candi- j
late, but it undoubtedly gives me pleas

ny country, bowing before the govern- !
ment given to it by the national will j
H^-ven years ago.
"At present things are greatly
changed. I think there is a disa
freement between the Government and j
:he feeling of the people. That is what j
Ihlfl last election has clearly shown.
'The period of humiliation abroad

*hich France has Just passed shows the
aecessity for a change In the constitu

"The only form of government which j

power that has neighbors can be had I

Who will give satisfaction to the de- j
inands of the people, to the interests of j

the feeling of honor and justice which i
we bear."
"Would you consent to be the head i

"I am always at the disposal of my
country."
FAURE TO HAVE
A PUBLIC FUNERAL
Even Respect for the Dead Fails to
Restrain a French Socialist.
PARIS, Feb. 20. â In the Chamber of
Deputies to-day the Premier, M. D ipjy,
isked for a credit of 160,000 franca to
Ipfray the expenses of the obsequi'-s of
â :he late President Faure.
Jf.' Jeante, Socialist, asked that the
>bsequies be purely civil.
This drew forth murmurs and pro
jests from the Rightists and Centrists.
Jho threatened to leave the chamber,
/he President of the Chamber of Depu-
JÂ«5, M. Deschanel, interrupted M. de
t^ante several times, calling upon him
io respect the stricken family of the
leceased.
M. de Jeante's motion was rejected
by "a vote of 444 to 68. and the credit
* as adopted by a vote of 463 to 42.
The Chamber unanimously decided to
mend the departure of the body from
!he Elysee Palace on Thursday, al
though the procession will really only
Â»c formed after leaving the Cathedral
it Notre Dame. A large multitude de
iled before the coffin of the dead Presi
lent to-day.
In view of the decision of the Cham-
W of Deputies it has now been ar

ranged that the entire funeral cortege
shall form at the Elysee Palace in
stead of at the Cathedral of Notre
Dame, as was previously intended.
Considerable comment has been
caused by the fact that a priest was
summoned to M. Faure'B bedside, al
though the President was a staunch
Free Mason. M. de Jeante, Socialist,
raised the subject to-day in the Cham
ber of Deputies. M. Legall, the Presi
dent's private secretary, when ques
tioned, declared that M. Faure, while
conscious, twice asked that a priest be
brought.
The strictest measures have been
taken to maintain order in the streets
to-night, the police, among other
things, having be*-n instructed to ar
rest immediately any person uttering
cries hostile to President Loubet.
According to the best authority,
President L,oubet'a message to Parlia
ment will not be a lengthy document.
After returning thanks for his election,
affirming his respect for the constitu
tion and pledging himself to uphold It
faithfully, both in spirit and letter the
President will appeal warmly for paci
fication and concord, and will eulogize
the army and express the hope that the
country will, in its attachment to the
army and its respect for justice, speed
ily witness the restoration of harmony
and the solution of questions that are
agitating the nation.
The President will then recall the
fact that he has always devoted him
self to the study of labor and social
questions, industrial matters^, financial
economy and the organization of indus
try, and he will insist upon Parliament
dealing with these questions in a faith
ful and practical manner.
Regarding foreign affairs, the mess
age vill say that In her relations with
toie} n nations France will pursue a
polic., which will remain faithful to
friendships formed, and that by its cor
rectness and disinterestedness will con
form to the traditions of her history.
This policy will be the surest guarantee
of peace and best calculated to main
tain the place which France now occu
pies in the world.

HAWLEY'S MURDER IS A
TRAGEDY OF TWO LIVES
Alma E. Burton Tells a Pathetic
Story of Her Effort to Re=
deem a Drunkard,
Sad End to a Romance of the Slumsâ Paul Mamogni
Saw the Crime and Says He Can Identify
the Murderer.
In his downfall and death Charles M.
Hauley dragged Miss Alma E. Burton
to dishonor. The man was murdered,
and his murder has been quickly fol
lowed by the expose of the woman's
disgrace! This latest story of a local
crime is of unusual pathos. Hawley
gave up family, friends, position and
life for his inordinate love of drink.
Miss Burton has sacrificed her name
and brought shame to her family
through her devotion to a self-imposed
duty to go into the dregs of society and
among its outcasts to rescue those who
had fallen from drink.
Hawley received his death blow on
Sunday night on Grant avenue, near
Geary street. He lingered, without re
gaining consciousness, until 1:30 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, when he died. It
was at first supposed that Hawley
might have met his death by accident..
This theory has been destroyed, how
ever, by the facts. Four people, a man
and three boys, saw Hawley killed, and
â¢the description of the murderer, as giv
en by one of the witnesses, is sufficient
to afford the police a clew strong
enough upon which to. work.
The most important of the four wit
nesses is Paul Mamognl, who stood
within ten fet of Hawley when the
blow was struck. It was almost 9
o'clock in the evening when Hawley
walked, slightly staggering, up Grant
avenue from Geary. Not noticing
where he was going Hawley jostled
into a young fellow coming toward
him. The stranger pushed Hawley
away. The assailed man reeled toward
the curb, then stood smiling in maud
lin good nature at his assailant. The
stranger rushed toward him and struck
him viciously behind the neck. Haw
ley tumbled face down upon the stone
walk and the stranger ran down Grant
avenue to Geary where he disappeared
from the view of those who had seen
the murder. This is the scene, as Paul
Mamogni describes it.
Mamogni says that he feels confident
that he could identify the murderer if
he ever saw him again. The stranger,
Mamogni says, was shorter than Haw
ley, slight of build, smooth shaven,
light complexioned and light haired.
He wore a dark sack suit of clothes and
a dark derby hat. Mamogni, who is
employed by business men in the down
town district and is familiar with faces
and scenes of the tenderloin, feels sure
that he has seen the murderer before
as one of the depraved creatures who
haunt the resorts of Grant avenue after
nightfall.
The testimony of three boys, Fred
Racik, Patrick Dougherty and George
Doran, may be added to that of Ma
mogni and then the evidence thus far
secured to reveal the perpetrator of the
crime is complete. The three boys were
on Grant avenue within a few feet from
where Hawley received his death blow.
They saw the encounter, heard the
murderer apply a vile epithet to his vic
tim and then strike at him viciously.
They agreed with Mamognl that the
assailant was a comparatively small
man, light of feature and of hair and
dressed In black.
The police have discovered nothing
more with which to expose the mur
derer and less with which to explain
a motive for the crime. The strange
relations between the murdered man
and his contract wife, Miss Alma E.
Burtc/n, may give an explanation per
haps in the jealousy of some besotted,
degraded outcast, who took murderous
revenge for the attentions that were
given to another and not to him. A
chance encounter may clear away the
mystery, but it is to the relationship
between Hawley and Miss Burton that
tragic Interest attaches.
The story of this association as it was
revealed yesterday in the gloomy re
sorts of outcasts, in tenderloin lodging
houses, Salvation Army headquarters
and the offices of the police is of great
sadness. Hawley went from a place
of honor and trust into the dregs.
Three years ago he was a prosperous
clerk of recognized ability and excel
lent family connections. Gradually he
began to drink and occasionally to be
unreliable in his duties to his employ*
ers. His lapses became more frequent
until they ended in his dismissal. He
Htill had friends and credit won by lav
ish generosity on "the line." It was
not long before friends and credit dis
appeared and he found his last check
before suicide in the wretched home of
the Salvation Army at Salt Lake City.
He was all but nominally a drunken
pauper existing on the charity of a be
neficent organization that tries to keep
body and soul together in an effort to
redeem both.
Even the officers of the Salvation
Army at Salt Lake could do no more
with Hawley, but they were not ready
to abandon him and sent him practical
ly as a ward to the Salvation Army
of this city. He came here a physical
and mental wreck, despondent and dis
couraged, in the fall of 1897. The offi
cers of the Workingmen's Institute at
158 New Montgomery street took him
in, fed him and housed him. They
have but poor fare and lodging:, but to
many it is better than the humiliation
of pauperism.
Hawley looked for work, but could
not find it. He was sent to the Salva
tion Army farm in Alameda and re
turned. In his efforts to recover him
self to sobriety he frequented the Peniel
Mission on Montgomery avenue and
Kearny street. This mission is con
ducted by a local branch of a national
society for the single purpose of re
deeming drunkards and of aiding them
to regain t-heir feet in their struggle.
At the local mission Hawley met Miss
Alma E. Burton, one of the directing
spirits of the place.
Miss Burton is a woman with a mis
sion. She lives with her widowed
mother and brothers at 225 Fifth ave
nue in this city. Miss Burton believed
that her duty called her into the dregs
of the Barbary Coast, among the be
sotted, degraded beings who haunt the
alleys in search of liquor. Miss Burton
believed that some of these outcasts
might be redeemed and she went among
them to counsel with them, advise them
and suggest to them an avenue through
which they could return to decent liv
ing. She began one of the two man
agers of the mission.
A few months ago she met Hawley,
who, she says. Impressed her as a man
of more than ordinary intelligence and

ANOTHER WEAK CLAIM
OF TOUTS EXPLODED
Currier Will Not Follow the Ex
ample of Simpson.
ENGLISH AND MEXICANS TO THE
FRONT.
Queer Backing of the Man Who Went Back On Bis
Constituents While Under the "Influence"
of the Mexican.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 20.â The claim put for
ward by the touts that Senator Currier
intended to follow the example of Simp
son and change from Bulla to Burns is
exploded by the following telegram re
ceived to-day:
LEMON, Cal., Feb. 20, 1899.
Senator K. N. Bulla, Sacramento: Am
in bed with grip and threatened with
pneumonia. Get me excused by the Sen
ate. Regret not being: there to vote for
you for Senator. A. T. CURRIER.
It seems to be the opinion that Sena
tor Currier will not return to Sacra
mento unless the session is unduly pro
longed by reason of the Senatorial
strife.
Senator Simpson passed two hours to
day in writing explanatory letters to
his constituents. According to all ac
counts the men in the south who are
bracing up Simpson are a queer crowd.
One of the letters in the Record-Union
purports to be from John S. Cox of
Pasadena. Cox is not a resident of
Pasadena, but lives in Los Angeles.
Moreover, he is a "'bloomin' Britisher,"
who cannot vote because he is not nat
uralized. Another letter is from Frank
Dominguez, a half Mexican. Within
the last ten days Senator Bulla received
a letter from Dominguez in which the
latter pledged his fidelity to the Sena
tor.
Irving M. Scott arrived from San
Francisco this evening and reopened
hip headquarters in the Golden Eaerlp
Hotel. Shortly after his arrival he was
greeted by his supporters â Senators
Davis and Assemblyman Dunlap. Mr.
Scott comes to stay until the deadlock
is broken or the Legislature adjourns.
His friends advised him of the situa
tion here, explaining that Burns was
the only Senatorial candidate in the
field who had refused to sacrifice his
own candidacy to secure the election of
a Republican United States Senator. It
was shown that Grant, Barnes and
Buila were willing to make any sacri
fice demanded in order that the field
might be cleared for the election of a
Senator.
When the situation is carefully stud
ied with reference to the future of the
Republican party in this State, it is ad
mitted by leading Republicans that it
would be better for the Legislature to
adjourn without electing a Senator
than to elect Dan Burns. Failing to
elect, the party could go before the
people two years hence and say that
the orders of the machine and railroad
were resisted by the manly and loyal
Republicans of the Legislature, and
the people would commend the act.
Should Burns, however, be chosen
Senator, the party would be disrupted.
A Democratic Legislature would be thr
result and the apportionment for ten
years on Democratic lines would leave
the Republicans at the mercy of their
political adversaries. An adjournment
without electing Burns would be a no
tice served on Burns and the machine
that the Republican party respected
the will of the people and would be
governed by the voice of the people.
On account of sickness General
Barnes remained at the Sutter Club for
a few hours one day last week. The
touts, observing his absence, spread a
report that he had closed headquarters
and given up the contest. His support
ers say that if there is any candidate
in this contest prepared to stay to the
finish of the session and accept the re
sult whatever it may be that candidate
is General Barnes. They also say that
there is not the color of truth in the
rumor that he intends to draw out, but
there is to-night an exceedingly bright
propect that he will win out.
Facts are now coming to light re
garding the secret effort in San Joaquln
County to have the county committee
direct Assemblyman Muenter to sup
port the Dan Burns caucus scheme. It
appears that the Republicans of Stock
ton were not advised of the meeting oi
informed that a petition was in circu
lation asking Assemblymen Dunlap and
Muenter to get In and do the work of
the touts. It is a well-known fact that
the Republicans of San Joaquin are op
posed to Burns and do not want the
Legislature to elect him to the United
States Senate, yet there is an effort In
secret to set aside the will of the peo
ple and practically instruct the San
Joaquln delegation to vote for Burns.
Mr. Muenter and Mr. Dunlap are well
advised as to the sentiments of their
constituents, and they are altogether
too bright and enterprising to be de
ceived by any one-sided petition circu
lated in secret by the agents of the
"organization." .
The touts are endeavoring to work
the Simpson game on another member
of the Legislature. The game was
overplayed Sunday night and the spec*
tacle observed by many members of the
joint convention to-day did not call out
compliments for the tactics of the
touts. The thought of debasing a man
with liquor and low associations until
his moral sense Is so blunted that he
cannot distinguish right from wrong is
' so repulsive to high minded men in the
Legislature that steps may be taken
to denounce on the floor of the joint
convention the latest and lowest
method of controlling votes for the of
fice of United States Senator.
The forces of Burns continue the as
sault on Grant's column, but the San
Diego candidate seems undisturbed.
He does not hear of any defections.
Many of the rumors of contemplated
desertion have been investigated and
found to be false. There are no indi
cations that Burns is making headway
In his efforts to secure a caucus and
it is by no means certain that he can
win with a caucus, but there is an ab
solute certainty that he cannot win
without one. The Burns plan of cam
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
paign te clearly unfolded. He desires
first of all to break the Grant camp
and scatter the forces of that fold ta
various candidates possessing local fa
vor and in the end gather in for his
own support the scattered members.
Grant is fully and promptly advised of
every step taken by the Candelaria
candidate. There is an apprehension
that Burns in his desperation will re
sort to open bribery, hence a remarka
bly close watch is maintained in this
respect.
There is a strong undercurrent In
General Barnes' favor, and it is a sig
nificant fact that the General has ad
vanced in the pools until he ranks next
to Burns. It wo'-ld be no surprise to
well informed men if he should be in
the lead before the week ends. He is
known to be the second choice of a
large number of the members of the
Legislature. The unfair report circu
lated last week that he intended to stay
in San Francisco when he went home
for his Sunday visit has not injured his
cause.
The deadlock could be broken to
morrow if Burns would consent to the
| election of any one but himself. Other
candidates are willing to sacrifice their
personal preferences and ambitions to
preserve the party unity and secure
I the election of a Senator, but Burns
alone stands out. declarlner that he
must be vindicated, and that if he can
not be Senator no one else Bhall be.
Judge Dibble is not satisfied with his
prerogative of cracking the whip over
the Assembly, but is ambitious to ex
tend his leadership over the party. He
clings to the doctrine of Burns for Sen
ator or nobody. Members of the As
sembly may conclude to take the man
agement of legislative affairs out of the
hands of Judge Dibble.
AN EARLY CLOSE OF THE
LEGISLATURE AUGURED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 20.-Assemblyman Valen
tine of Los Angeles, who is chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, expects
to have the general appropriation bill on
the floor of the Assembly to-morrow. If
he carries out his intention it augurs an
early finish to this session. As a general
thing the promulgation of the general ap
priation bill is the last and most important
task that falls to the lot of the Ways and
Means Committee and it is Invariably the
precursor of adjournment sine die.
Apropos of adjournment to-day was the
last day of the session on which bills
might be introduced, but even so there
was scarcely more than a dozen and few
of them such as one experienced of
Legislatures expects to see rushed In at
the eleventh hour. The "cinch bill" of
dishonored history was not numerously
among them.
Crowder of San Diego was the author of
two of them. One of them establishes the
maximum rate for railroad transportation
at 3 cents per mile first-class and 2' 2 cents
per mile second-class. It also makes the
rate for children under 12 years of ago
*Â± cent per mile, and requires that first
and second class tickets shall be sold at
every station and for all trains.
His othr>r bill provides a whole section
for the traveler who has bought but one
$2 50 berth in a sleeper. It requires that
when only the lower berth of a sootion
is sold the upper berth must not be let
down until it, too. Is disposed of. As it
Is, it Is the delight of the Ã¼biquitous por
ter to rush frantically down the car and
with a rattle of chains let down thf up
per berth just after the man who has not
left up the usual dollar has gotten com
fortably asleep. Mr. Crowder proposes to
Bleep without paying an aggregate of $3 50
for his bed when tie goes back to San
Diego from this Legislature, and he as
signs no other reason for his proposed en
actment.
Mr. Caminetti's anti-treat bill passed
with little in the way of opposition. It
provides that no candidate for office shall
liquefy his campaign with any intoxicat
ing or temperance drinks. He shall not
buy for nor give to any one. whether for
his vote or not, any beverage of any de
scription.
It was strongly backed by Grove L.
Johnson, who told the history of his life
and his record on prohibition. It was also
backed by Judge Dibble, who said he had
not spent a cent in riotous living during
the last election because he had been siok
in bed.
Lawrence Hoey of San Francisco op
posed the measure on the broad principle
that it was so general and withal vague
in its provisions that it could be easily
evaded. He said. too. that he thought It
was his good American privilege to treat
when he could afford it and he denied any
man's right to curtail it.
Assemblyman Raw of El Dorado fought
the bill when it came up in 1893 and he
fought it again to-day. He ridiculed what
he called an attempt to infringe upon the
personal rights of an American citizen,
and spoke forcefully against the meas
ure and its general tenor. Brown of San
Mateo added his voice to the chorus
against the measure, but it was all of no
avail, the vote showed few supporters
for the opposition and the measure car
ried.
Senator Dickinson's Senate bill 59.
which provides for the "inspection of
dairies and factories for the making of
dairy products and of dairy products as
to the sanitary condition and as to the
health of stock and to prevent the sale of
milk drawn from diseased animals." was
passed after several speeches of indorse
ment had been made in its favor.
Atherton of Marin spoke strongly for it.
Le Barron of Sonoma said his " people
strongly Indorsed it. and all of the other
Cow County Representatives swelled the
chorus.
The claim of Lawrence Dunnigan for
$5000 gave rise to a good bit of what As
semblyman Charlie Kenneally calls "per
slflag. During- the strike of '94 Mr. Dun
nlgran was shot through both knees and
the ball that did the work killed a man
who was standing near him. Dunnigan
was left crippled for life and the widow
of the man who was killed got $5000 by

A RAILROAD BILL
WITH A JOKER
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Fek 2').â Assemblyman Valen
tine of Los Angeles Introduced in the As
sembly to-<lay a bill which doubtless
every railroad in the State will take
pleasure in becking. It amends section
456 of the. < ivil Code wo that railroad cor
porations may mortgage and remortgage
their properties so long as any one can
be found to loan money on successive
bond issues. It throws off the present
limitation that bonds may be issued only
to the extent of a railroad's capitaliza
tion and makes it possible for any road
or combination of roads to keep transpor
tation charges up to the top notch in spite
of the Railroad Commission. It aceom
lilishÂ«Â»s all this by permitting; ii company
to mortgage and remortgage, the accru
ing interest to stand as a fixed charge
a.gainst the company. As the Railroad
Commission cannot reduce fares to a rate
so low that the interest pro rata cannot
y<G met, the little joker in Mr. Valentine's
bill is seemingly apparent.
Section 456 provides for the borrowing
of money, and to it, before Valentine's
bill cut it out, was attached the follow
ing clause:
"The amount of bonds or promlesory
hptes issued for such purposes must not
exceed in all the amount of the capital
stock."
That is the little joker in the. bill. The
section is allowed to remain as ft was
with the exception that this clause is left
out. Mr. Valentine says he introduced tho
bill by request and is now looking into it.
He says that If the bill proves to be as
it appears on its face he will withdraw It
or allow it to die peacefully and quietly
in committee.
Ready to Remove San Quentin.

Reformatories returned this morning
from Its junketing tour to San Quenttn.
where It went to inspect the building." of
the State Prison. In regard to which
there is a bill before the Assembly. Those
of the committee who went were: Assem
blymen Bliss, Atherton, Falrweather,
Eugene Sullivan. Henry and Glenn, 1..a
bill provides for the removal of a portion
of the prison. If not all, from its present j
locality. It appears to be the desire of the â¢
people of Marfn County to have it as far
away as possible, as they claim that at !
present it is a decided menace to the best
interests of the county. It is claimed
that by allowing six years for the re
moval there would be sufficient time for
the selling of the present buildings and
site to advantage and in that way de
rive enough money to build a prison,
which will accommodate the less des
perate cases, while the others could be'
transferred to Folsom. The committee
found the means for accommodations at â¢
San Quentin very inadequate and appear ,
to be heartily in favor of the bill.
A MOVE MADE
IN THE DARK
A Little Quiet "Instructing"
Done for Burns at
Stockton.
STOCKTON, Feb. 20.â The represent
atives nf Dan Burns in the executive
committee of the Republican County
Committee got in their work to-day, i
This executive committee has become |
famous for indorsing any old thing on
the quiet. The first move in favor of
the Mexican was completed to-day
when the following resolutions were
'circulated' quietly among some of the
members who were "on":
Whereas, Recognizing the fact that the
material intercuts of the State of Califor
nia may be jeopardized should there be a ;
failure by the Legislature in session to ;
elect a Republican United States Senator
to succeed Hon. Stephen M. White, whose
term expires on the 4th of March next,
and realizing; that the existing deadlock
ia causing a feeling- of uneasiness in the :
Republican party, throughout the State,
and believing it to be the duty of the
members of the Legislature *o break the
deadlock, and to use all honorable means j
to secure the election of such Senator; i
therefore be it
Resolved, By the executive committee of j
the Republican Uounty Central Commit
tee of San Joaquln County, that our As
semblymen from this county be and they !
are hereby urgently requested to assist
or if necessary to take the initiative in |
such proceedings, caucuses or such other
means as may be necessary and proper to j
break the deadlock and assure the elec- |
tkm of a Republican United States Sena- !
tor at this session of the Legislature.
These were signed by a number of !
the city committeemen. The purpose !
of these? "instructions" are to make it
easy for Assemblymen Dunlap and
Muenter to go into caucus, and should
Burns be the nominee they could say
i they merely followed instructions. Re
publicans regard the work of Chair
man Harkness and his few friends as
nothing short of political perfidy. They
dared rot call the Republican County
Committee together, as anything the
least favorable to Burns would have
| been almost unanimously voted down.
This is not the first time this "execu
tive committee" has made a wild move
like this, but it will probably be the
last.
When interviewed Dr. George 8.
Harknesa, chairman of the committee,
said:
"It is very important that a Senator
should be chosen. If the present Leg
islature does not make a selection and
leaves matters in an unsettled condi
tion the next Legislature will probably
be Democratic and we will then lose a
Senator. We can never tell how im
portant one vote in Congress may bÂ«.
Wry ofton grave questions hinge on
one vote. I think that some arrange
ments shouid be made whereby a Sena
tor will be elected."

could be relied upon to stand out for all time against the approaches of
the Burns element or the wiles of any other candidate opposed to the
election of Grant. Cargill and Marvin were not vouched for with that
absence of reserve which marked the pledges for the others, but it wrvs
s.u J that they would not waver in their Riipport of Grant.

cast for, that candidate. Should the conference appointed for Wednes

IN WHITE UNIFORMS.
A Beneficial Change to the City's
Street-Sweeping Force,
The members of the Merchants' Asso
ciation were highly pleased yesterday by
the appearance on the streets down town
of a lot of street sweepers dressed in
white garments and wearing white hats.
When the work of cleaning the thorough
fares by hand first came into vogue the
officers of the association had their men
dress in brown goods. In time they
learned that the wnite goods was better
for several reasons. The principal one
was that the men were less liable to be
run down by drivers, the white goods be
ing easily seen. Wh^n Mr. Kingwent East
several months ago he found in nearly all
of the big cities that this style of gar
ment prevailed and even in the little
towns where sweeping was done by hand.
Upon hts return he advised that the
change be made.and the association In as
sisting the Supervisors in drawing up the
contract for street sweeping specified that
the sweepers should be dressed in white
duck. The men themselves are pleased
with the change, as they realize that the
uniform really makes them a part of the
city's working force.

Through the carelessness or incompe

for nearly three months. The amount
due the sextet of drivers is not overlarge,
as they earn but $30 and under a month,
out of which they clothe, feed and lodge

The withholding of their money has
worked a hardship on the men, as. their
boarding house keepers have been clam

answer that some is due them and may
be received any day. These empty prom

The men alluded to are Foreman Jack

been put off as often as they asked. The
sub-contractor is lying in bed at his
home at 516 Folsom street, suffering from
illness, and the drivers have been unable
to see him during the past few weeks. A
week ago they received renewed assur
ances of receiving their pay from J. N.
Games, a representative of the Midland
Mall Company. The latter explained to
the men that Morrison had either through
ignorance or mistake improperly made
out the official documents, causing a delay
in the payment of their salary. Mr.
Games is staying at the New Western
Hotel, and to one of the drivers, who, ac
companied by his boarding-house keeper,
called on him last evening, he said the
money would shortly be paid.
Mr. Games explained the present
trouble in the following manner: "The
president of the Midland Mail Company,
J. P. Stewart, and W. H. Smith bid and
were awarded the contract for carrying
the mail to and from the trains in this
city. Mr. Stewart delegated to Mr. Mor
rison the duty of employing the drivers
and furnishing the horses. The latter was
also authorized to pay the men with
money received from Stewart. This plan
went along all right until the latter part
of October, when Stewart failed. New
contracts, in which Stewart was inter
ested, were sublet and Morrison became
a sub-contractor, but in filling out his
papers he made many mistakes and they
were returned from Washington. Owing
to the sickness of Morrison they were un
corrected until I arrived two weeks ago.
I tilled the papers out properly and for
warded them to Washington. There has
not been time for their examination and
I therefore do not expect them returned
for another week." f
So. until they do arrive, the men will
not be compensated for their hard work.
Even "Pop" Morrison, the father of the
sub-contractor, "kicked" for his money,
and now that he learns the delay in its
payment was due to his son's procrastina
tion he will probably lecture him on his
ways.
As for the poor drivers, they live in
hope and stand off their landlords.
KILPATKICK IS THE WINNEB.
The School Principal Beinstated and
Gets His Back Salary.
The appeal case of E. C. Ivilpatrick
against the Board of Education was dis
missed yesterday by the Supreme Court.
Since the beginning of this year this mat
ter has really been a dead issue. It will
be remembered that over a year ago the
old Board of Education had a serious diffi
culty with the principal of the Business
Evening School over remarks that the
gentleman had made reflecting upon the
integrity of some of the members. The
board decided that there was but one
thing to do and that was to discipline the
too talkative Kilpatrlck, the supposition
being that if he were not corrected others
might also become free of speech and
state some facts that would not renect
credit if maae public. Mr. Kilpatrick
would not eat humble pie worth a cent,
and reiterated the offensive statements
that some members of the Board of Edu
cation had sold positions to teachers, and
tnat $500 was the ordinary price for a
place in the School Department.
i- or this he was dismissed, the charge
being generalâ unprofesional conduct. Kil
patrTck refused to accept this as final, and
began an action in the Superior Court to
secure his regular monthly pay and to
compel the board to reinstate him in his
old position. In the lower court Judge
Hunt decided in his favor on both points,
but the Board of Education was dissatis
fied and appealed the case to the higher
court. In the slow order of things there
the case finally oarne up, and by this time
the old board being out of office the new
board concluded that there was nothing
in maintaining the contest and consented
to a dismissal of the appeal, which really
is a victory for Kilpatnck, who will be re-
Instated and get his back salary for a
year or more.
WORK ON VALLEY ROAD.
Considerble progress is now being made
on the Valley road between Point Rich

advantage of tho new line.
The work near Point Richmond is rap
idly advancing. A steam shovel is now
being operated in excavating 250,000 cubic
yards to fill in a portion of the bay for
about 3000 feet for the purpose of saving
time and distance.
The debris from the recent slide in the
big Franklin tunnel has been cleared
away and the tunnel toward Concord is
nearly finished.
The Bucknuan Contracting Company
says that the tunnel near Pinole will be

GHOULISH QUARREL
BREADS OUT ANEW
Strife of Los Angeles Uodertakers
Over the Body of
Hunter.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 20.â The body of Attorney Jay E. Hunter, who
died as a result of the wounds inflicted by "W. H. Alford, was to-day re
moved lo the undertaking rooms uf iircsee Brothers at the request of
Hunter's friends. This rekindled the feud between Coroner Holland and
the undertaking fraternity. When Holland heard his enemies had pos
session of the body his anger was great. Earl Ropers, attorney for Al
ford, notified the Coroner that the body was decomposing and that an
immediate autopsy was necessary. This morning Holland served the
following notice on the Bresees:
"I hereby officially demand the body of Jay E. Hunter, deceased, for
the purpose "of holding an autopsy and inquest as prescribed by law."
The Coroner held another one of those famous conferences with the
District Attorney. General Jones told Holland that he felt some respect
was due the dead man, and that his remains should not be the subject
of a Coroner's quarrel, and he advised Coroner Holland to hold the in
quest. Holland gave in and held the inquest, at the suggestion of Gen
eral Jones, where the body lay.
"I held the autopsy and inquest by request and shall determine my
rights by law later on," said the Coroner to-night.

At the special Invitation of the Presby

of Madame Blavatsky in India. The speak

ever gained control over people, Theoso

monism and its doctrines of polygamy
nearly approached it. The doctor's pa
per was a severe criticism of Blavatsky
and her cult. In part he said:
"We may also add that no national ;
teacher of any accredited standing in any
school of philosophy In India ever ap
peared before the public in India as an
advocate of Madame Blavatsky's peculiar
system. It is only in England or in Con

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
. MENTO, Feb. 20.â There was not a
fault nor frailty, human or infernal,
â¢ that was not charged to the newspa
pers this afternoon and evening on the
; floor of the Senate chamber. There
was not a word of bitterness left un-
Faid nor a stone unthrown, and from
"Rats of the press" to "Curs and dogs"
there was no epithet unapplied, not a
knife but was driven home. All the
afternoon and all the evening the Sen
ate chamber rang to the pent-up woes
of those who had felt the lash and
those who feared it, and then the pet
measure of young Mr. Works was
amended and re-amended and sent to
the printer to recuperate for another
...round on third reading.
.]â¢ It was the wildest time the orators
â¢ .have brad since the beginning of the
' session, and they took full advantage
. : -oÂ£.'. the occasion. It was rhetoric and
..'metaphor, figure and simile, from 2:30
. to 4:30 and from S o'clock to 10; and
V. then the vote was taken and everybody
'-.Voted Just as he would have voted had
:.. there been no oratory; but the silent
â â  . ones were tired and didn't care, and the
.orators were satisfied and exhausted,
; . and it was everybody's turn to con
.'â¢ gratulate everybody else. Altogether it
"was a great day for the press and pub
lic men.
The bill was introduced in the As
'-. sembly by young Mr. Works of San
â¢'â¢ Piego, who listened to the wiles
of Grove Johnson, and believed
him when the ancient statesman
pointed out the path of fame. Johnson
. Fuggested the chestnut, and young Mr.
;; Works immediately pulled it from the
. -.fire. It passed the Assembly, and to
:â¢;â  -day. after the Senate had flirted with
;"." Its place on the file for a week, it came
:â¢. -up on second reading and immediately
: ignited the oil of Senatorial oratory
â¢' and let it blaze in the light of the peo
. pie. The offspring of young Mr. Works'
â  fancy is as follows:
Section 1. A new section is hereby added
â¢ to the Penal Code, to be known as section
. 255. and to read as follows:
v\ "Section 258. It shall be unlawful to
publish in any newspaper, handbill, post
" â¢ er, book or serial publication or supple
. ment thereto the portrait or caricature of
THE MEXICAN "DOES" POLITICS IN HIS OWN HARMLESS WAY.
any living person a resident of California
without the written consent of such per
son first had and obtained; provided, that
it shall be lawful to publish the portrait
of a person oonvicted of a crime. A vio
lation of this section shall be a misde
meanor, and shall be punishable by a line
of not less than $100 nor more than $500,
or by imprisonment in the County Jail for
not less than one month nor more than
six months, or by both such fine and im
prisonment. All persons concerned in
paid publication, either as owner or man
ager, editor or publisher, or engraver, are
each liable for said publication."
When the bill came up Senator Cur
tin submitted the following amend
ment:
Sec. 255. It shall be unlawful to pub
lish In any newspaper, handbill, poster,
book or serial publication, or supplement
thereto, the portrait of any living person
a resident of California other than that
of a person holding a public office in this
State without the written consent of such
person first had and obtained; provided,
that it shall be lawful to publish the por
tralt of a person convicted of a crime.
It shall likewise be unlawful to publish
In any newspaper, handbill, poster, book
or serial publication or supplement there
to any caricature of any person residing
In this State, which caricature will In any
manner reflect upon the honor, integrity,
manhood or reputation or business or po
litical motives of the person so carl
( atured or which tends to expose the In
dividual so caricatured to public hatred
or contempt.
To the amendment of Senator Cur
tin, Senator Leavitt submitted another
amendment, adding the word "ridicule"
before the word contempt in the sub
stitute section, and th^n upon the word
"ridicule" the fight was on.
In introducing his amendment. Sena
tor Curtin said that the bill was aimed
to prevent an undoubted evil, but that
it went too far. There was no harm
in a cartoon that was neither malicious
nor personal, and he did not think such
drawings should be legislated out of
existence. When a man aspires to pub
lic office, he said, he becomes, in a
measure, public property, but only s<>
far as his public life was concerned,
and so far would he allow the cartoon
ist to ply his trade: he objected to the
prohibition of such cartoons by the
original bill. It was then that Leavitt
submitted his amendment and a quar
ter of an hour was spent on definition
df the word "ridicule" before the de
bate was again taken up.
The amendment on ridicule having;
been allowed to come before the House.
IHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1899.
Sims of Sonoma rose to oppose the bill.
"This Senate." he said, "should not
pass laws to restrict the pictorial ex
pressions of the opinions of the press.
Any one who has recognized the great
ness of this country has seen that much
| of its greatness has been due to a fear
-1 less expression of opinion on the part
\ of the press and to the free exercise of
I the right of free speech on the part of
I the people.
"The press has been the most power
! ful element of modern civilization; it
has contributed more to the history of
I the country than any other instrument,
| and its rights should not be curbed.
; There are libel laws to protect any .one
! who believes himself injured and they
i can be made to punish the publication
of anything untrue, and as we should
not suppress the expression of opinion in
| the columns so we should not legislate
I against the expression of opinion by
cartoons."
Senator Simpson was of a different
mind. "I had not thought," he said, "to
say anything on this subject, but if
there is any one who has the right to
stand up and declare himself for the
rights of the people, I am that man."
He then went on to justify himself for
going over to Burns. He believed there
should be a certain amount of liberty
I for the press, and he recognized the
right of the papers to criticize when a
j man had been guilty of malfeasance In
office or had betrayed a trust, but when
he had exercised an individual right
the Senator from Pasadena thought the
! papers had no business to interfere.
Senator Morehouse claimed the floor
when Senator Simpson had finished.
Now Morehouse can grow enthusiastic
on many subjects, but there is none
which wings his muse quicker or higher
i than the rights of the press. He has
felt the sting of both pen and pencil
and he speaks by the book â and he can
speak when he wants to. He had full
I swing for an hour in the afternoon and
along in the evening he remembered a
few things he might have said, but
which had slipped his memory, and so
he rose again and started another out
burst of as bitter and scathing a de
nunciation as was ever whirled around
his own head.
He declared there were many news
papermen whom he knew and some
I whom he loved, but there was one for
! whom he had the deepest, most undy
ing, unquenchable, unsparing, uncon
trollable hatred, and he declared he
would mention his name only it would
be a disrespect to the honorable body
of which he was a member.
"No newspaper has any more right
than an individual," he began, "and it
has no more right to blast a man's
character or reputation. We should
stand like men and let them know there
j is a limit beyond which no artist and
Ino scribbler can go. The point here in
) this bill and in the amendment is that
; no newspaper shall do a man an injury;
! when it expects to slander and blacken
| it should be stopped; all we ask is that
j it do no wrong."
Then the Senate took up the difficul
ties of securing redress through the
course prescribed by the law. â  He re
ferred to the farce of trying to secure a
summons on Hearst, the absent pro
prietor of the Examiner. He described
the cool and deliberate methods of the
courts and the callowness of some of
the District Attorneys, and declared
! that no one could get justice in this
; land where justice was the fundamental
principle.
"And who is the man who is re
sponsible?" the irate orator shouted in
tones that made the gallery shiver.
â¢Can you go to New York and kill the
vile dog? No â it is murder. You go to
the office in San Francisco and they
all hide behind the paper, and then
when you have them up here before a
Senate committee they refuse to answer
and go to jail until the Legislature is
over and has lost jurisdiction.
"No man appreciates newspaper men
more than I do, but here is this bill:
it allows them to publish the portrait
of a man when there is no malice and
no ill-will. It is enough. Is there any
man in this Senate so low as to Rive
the press power to ruin him? My mo
tives may not agree with those of Mr.
Hearst, for he does not know how to
run a paper, but with a certain un
namable man, to mention whose name
would be a disrespect to this Senate."
He referred to a cartoon in last Sun
; day's Call. Colonel Jackson was por-
I trayed in the act of drilling a hole
i through the door of a safe â breaking a
I deadlockâ and Major McLaughlin was
I eagerly watching in the distance the
i success of the preparation. "There was
no venom, no personality in the car
toon," said Morehouse, "and it is to
protect just such cartoons that this bill
i is here before us."
Senator Shortridge had no use for the
| bill or the amendments. He declared it
! was unconstitutional and would be
I found so by the Supreme Court if it
' should ever become a law, for, he said,
j it was a restriction of the liberty of
i the press guaranteed by the Constitu
! tion of the United States.
The right of free speech, said Senator
Shortridge. goes hand in hand with the
j liberty of the press. If you assail the
I one you strike at the other, and if you
I curb the press you abridge free speech.
He declared that the broad question of
the liberty of the press was the real one
j under discussion, and he demanded
j that the whole press should not suffer
I for the excesses of a small part.
Senator Boyce asked the difference
| between liberty and license, and an*
other half hour was devoted to the defi
nition of terms. Shortridge declared
that the printing of cartoons was one
! way of expressing opinions and came
within the limits of the constitutional
guarantee. If cartooning by pictures
j could be abridged, he said, so could car
tooning by words, and that the law
I would not allow. "The pen of the
writer and the cartoonist," he conclud
ed, "whips into line the rascal and the
rogue, and in doing so is a benefit to
j society. I have an appreciation for the
! whip when it is laid on the back of a
| rascal and I have a respect for the pen
; in an honest hand, and for us, as Sena
i tors, to abridge the liberty of either is
' flying in the face of the constitution."
Senator Gillette spoke in a similar
j vein. He believed the laws were broad
enough to cover the ground already.
i He believed if a man was caricatured.
! his own conduct was responsible and
j he should not complain.
Sims spoke again, coldly and logic
ally as before, and opposed the bill on
I no other ground than that of public
policy and constitutionality. Then
' Simpson tried another round, but he
I tried to merge a question of personal
I privilege into the discussion and he
was silenced with a point of order.
! The members did not wish to hear
again why he voted for Burns.
Senator Jones won for himself a
round of applause by saying cartoon
ing had gone so far it was neither
amusing nor damaging and, if let alone,
! it would die of itself.
Smith wanted the amendment
I downed, and said so with the brevity
which characterizes him, and then,
after more talk, the great question went
over to the night session.
Dickinson started the ball rolling in
the evening. He said much that was
! to the point, but in rounding un the
! absentee proprietor of the Examiner
i there was none so bitter as he. He
spoke of the difference between liberty
and license, and then picked to pieces
the morals of at least one man who
tries to show the path of right and
wrong. He told what he knew of
I Hearst and his manner of living at
j Sausalito. "I live in Sausallto," he
j said, in speaking of Hearst, "and no
i man on this floor who has a wife would
associate with him as I have seen him
on the boat going back and forth, to
and fro, between San Francisco and
Sausalito. And this is the man who
dares tell me what I should do and how
I should do it."
Then Morehouse was given another
chance and he duplicated his success of
the afternoon and then the amendment
went to a vote.
Leavltt's amendment adding the
word "ridicule" was adopted. Then

HAWLEY'S MURDER.
Continued from First Page.
breeding for his surroundings. Hawley
liKtd Miss Burton, and the mutual lik
ing grew to something deeper. Hawley
professed love to the woman, and she
was not averse to the profession. Then
the marriage c<intract was mad*; by
-Miss Burton at the request and tc
please Hawley, she says. This was
done in November, but Hawley re
mained a pensioner still at the Woik
ingmen'B Institute.
Three weeks ago his material Dros
pects brightened. Through the Inter
cession of the assistant secretary of the
Young Men's Christian Association
Hawley received a position as book
keeper in the employ of Goldberg,
Bowen & Co. He proved to be an ad
mirable clerk, and with his chancre of
condition he changed his habitation.
He moved his effects to a room in the
lodging house at 230 Stockton street.
Miss Burton went with him to arrange
his room, adorn his dresser and in
( rease his comforts. Miss Burton ex
plained to the landlady, Mrs. J. J.
Whitney, that she could not always be
with her husband, an she had a home in
Berkeley, and h<*r husband could not be
with her every night. It seemed
strange yesterday that when the de
tectives searched the room of the dead
man they found upon the dresser which
Miss Burton had adorned a handker
chief spattered with blood.
Miss Burton was with Hawley fre
quently. On last Saturday night she
found him greatly under the influence
of liquor. The old craving had returned
and he could not resist it. He was
gloomy and downcast. He had called
upon J. J. Whitney and In drunken
pleading asked for protection from fan
cied evils. When Miss Burton came
Hawley was no more buoyant and she
determined to remain with him that
night.
The next day they both arose and
Miss Burton proposed a ride to the Cliff
House. She said after he agreed to go
that she would leave first, go to her
own home at 225 Fifth avenue and then
meet him. On leaving Miss Burton
paid for a month's rent. She met Haw
ley near her home and with him went
to the Cliff House. The couple spent
several hours there and then began the
home journey.
Miss Burton again stopped at nor
home and Hawley left her, with a
premise to her that he would re-din
from liquci. He came down town, and
his movements are lost until h-; met â 
his -iÃsailar.t. He did not ke-ip hi* |
promise. While he was receiving the
blow that gavt- him death Miss Burton
was counseling with her drunken
charges to regenerate themselves.
When her work was over she went to
the room that she and Hawley occu
pied the night before. She remained
until yesterday morning and then left
| to learn that Hawley had been assault
ed to death. \
This in outline is the story that Misa
Burton told last night to Detectives
Reynolds and Dlnan, who had worked
assiduously and well on the case all
day. Aa soon as possible the woman
was taken to police headquarters. She
related her story of her association
with Hawley in tears and with evidence
of the deepest distress. She explained
the presence of the blood-stained hand
kerchief In Hawley's room by saying
that Hawley's nose had bled profusely
on Saturday night and the handkerchief
I had been used to stay the flow. Early
in the morning Misa Burton had gone
to police headquarters to ask for a
valuable diamond ring that was in the
dead man's possession. She claimed
the ring as her own, but the police
would not give it to her.
Miss Burton was accompanied last
night by her brother, George Burton.
Before they were allowed to ko the
three boys who were witnesses of the
assault were called into the room and
asked if George Burton answered the
description of the murderer. The boys
unanimously declared that Burton was
not the man. The police then permit
ted Burton and his sister to go, satis
fied that neither had anything to do
with the murder of the woman's con
tract husband. The police will now
continue their search.

MANAGER BRADY'S LOSS.
Receives the News of the Death of
His Son in New York.
William A. Brady, who managed the
six-day bicycle race in the Pavilion last '
week, received the Bad news yesterday
that his son. William A. Jr., aged 5Va
years, had died of pneumonia.
During the whole time the races were in
progress the boy lay sick at the home on
West One Hundred and Twenty-third
street. New York, and while being irri- I
tated with the thousand and one worries â 
consequent upon the management of the ;
cycling carnival, down at the bottom of !
his heart the fond father saw only the i
little sufferer on his bed of pain. All !
who came in contact with Mr. Brady were i
convinced that something was worrying â 
him; he was absent-minded and despond
ent at times and was even accused by !
some of having lost his skill as a man- j
agtT and mismanaging the race.
But a few of his most intimate friends
knew the real cause of the trouble. Every
two hours, day and night, a telegraphic
message was handed to Mr. Brady telling 'â 
of the condition of the boy he loved. The
dispatches were all encouraging in char
acter, but Mr. Brady more than suspected
thpy were of a deceptive nature; that they
hid the real truth to ease his mind and
this perhaps only added to his worry.
Now that the end has come many people
who wondered at the vague, unsatisfac
tory answers given by him to questions of
greatest import will understand. It was a ;
case of body here and a mind thousands ,
of miles away by the bedside of a little
scfferer.
As soon as he had received the sad news
Mr. Brady boarded the first train for the
East and is now speeding toward the
darkened, sorrowful home.

SUDDEN SCARE
Were Disposing of In

VISION OF PRISON WALLS
A MAD RUSH MADE FOR THE
REVENUE OFFICE.
Planked Down Heaps of Yellow Gold
for Bar Privileges, But Were
Told Not to Get Ex
cited.
Messrs. Johnson and McCutcheon of
San Rafael startled United States Inter
nal Revenue Agent Burt M. Thomas yes
terday morning- by filing into his office
at the head of a large delegation of their
fellow members of the aristocratic golf
club which has its headquarters at San
Rafael and planking down some gold
pieces on Mr. Thomas' desk.
The visitors were perspiring-, lor the day
was warm and they had come in a hurry
to pay a license for selling- champagne
and other liquid truck in tneir olubrooms.
Mr. Thomas said that he could not re
ceive the money, and that all payments
should be made to Internal Revenue Col
lector Belrude ai Sacramento, but he
eased their fears by informing them they
did not need to feel any alarm, as they
had until the end of tho month in which
to pay the license.
Mr. Thomas declined to talk about the
matter except that the gentlemen repre
senting the club had offered to pay tho
money. They had been laboring under a
misapprehension. They were new in tho
business of selling liquor, he added; that
is, they had only just started up to dis
pense hospitality of the Kentucky kind in
the elubrooms, and they had until thÂ«
end of the month to pay, and that was
all that there was to it.
It wÂ»i reported that the members had
consulted Judge Morrow, a fellow mem
ber, as to whether they would be liable
to pay an internal revenue tax if they
established a sideboard for members only,
and that he had advised them that they
were. His advice was disregarded and,
the sideboard was inaugurated without
the slightest tip being given to .the reve
nue authorities. Then some one passed
the word around that they were to bo
haled before the internal revenue agents,
and the horror of it gave them the heart
disease. _______ â â

whether their beauty is fading. A wom-
an's beauty fades very rapidly if she is
troubled with some derangement of the

or carelessness in this respect frequently
causes great suffering and irregularity in
ifter life. Little irregularities and weak-
iesses in girlhood should be looked upon
promptly and properly treated at once.
Mothers cannot be too conscientious in
this respect, and cannot throw aside the
prudery that is so prevalent upon this point
too soon. Every young woman should
know something about her own physical
make-up, and the importance to her future
of her local as well as general health. A
woman who suffers from weaknesses pe-
culiar to her sex will rapidly lose her
beauty, her general health, her amiability
and her usefulness and capability as a -wife

WRANGLE OF THE
SPANIARDS OVER
NATION'S DEFEAT
CouQt d'Almeoas Coroplains That
"Five Months Had Elapsed
and Not a Single Gen
eral Been Shot."
MADRID, Feb. 20,â The Cortes reas
sembled to-day. The galleries in both
chambers were thronged with an ex
pectant crowd. The Senate was very
full, hardly a single general being ab-
Bent,
Senor Montero Rios, president of the
Senate.. in opening the proceedings, pro
nounced.a eulogy upon M. Faure. and
a resolution of condolence with France
was adopted unanimously.
Senor Sagasta, the Premier, then pro
ceeded to refer the bill providing for
the cession of the Philippines to the
United States to a special committee,
but the Conservatives protested against
this, declaring that the bill ought to be
conscientiously discussed, and Senor
Sagasta withdrew his proposal.
. Count d'Almenas then brought up the
question of the conduct of the generals
engaged in the war in Cuba, declaring
that General Primo de Rivera, General
Weyler, General Blanco. Admiral Cer
vera and General Linares had proven
failures.
.This declaration elicited much ap
plause from the public galleries, in con
sequence of which several of the spec
tators wÂ« re expelled from the Chamber.
Observing th t he would deal with
the â shai.'f".' capitulation of Santi
ago," Count d'Almenas asked the House
whether he should proceed and was
answered with cries of "Yes" and "No,

A repetition of the query provoking

and defended the Government and its
peace commission. The Premier criti
cized America's unjustified conduct and
said that everything might be dis
cussed except the war. because the
-cases of the generals were still sub
judice.
Count d'Almenas resumed his attack
upon the generals and complained that
"five months had elapsed and not a
single general been shot."
This gave rise to another tumult and
Count d'Almenas was called to order.
Again he asked why the generals who
capitulated had not been executed. It
is quite true, he declared that the army

MORE POWERFUL
THAN DYNAMITE
New Explosive Powder i
Invented.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 20.â Dr. H. P. Tuttle
of this city is the Inventor of a new
explosive powder, which he believes
will go far toward revolutionizing na
val warfare. It is more powerful than j
nitroglycerin or dynamite, and yet
may be handled with perfect safety.
Dr. Tuttle returned yesterday from a
two months' trip to Washington City, j
where he has been in conference with j
the army ordnance board regarding his I
new powder. What results were at
tained there he will not say, because
the ordnance board, he says, has re
quested him to keep silent.
Before laying the matter before the
United States ordnance board, Tuttle I
entertained Admiral Pellisere of , the
British squadron at Esquimalt with an
exhibition of his powder, and the mat
ter was referred- to the British Admir
alty for discussion and investigation.
At Esquimalt he first exploded some
of his powder in the open, demonstrat
ing its terrible destructive force. Then
he undertook to show that it was safe
to handle. The party returned to the
machine shops, where Doctor Tuttle
made the somewhat startling state
ment that his powder could be pounded
on an anvil with a sledge hammer <t
thrust through with a red-hot iron and
yet would not explode. Experiments
proved these assertions to be true.
Striking a pound of it with a sledge
hammer had no more effect than
pounding so much sand.
A cannon on board the flagship was
next loaded with <>ne of Tuttle's shells,
which was thrown against the sitie of
a rocky cliff a quarter of a mile away.
It mashed to pieces on the rocks and
tore up such a quantity of dust and dirt
that the captain of the flagship avowed
that it exploded.
"No, it did not,"' maintained Dr. Tut
tle; "that was only the shock of tho
impact. I will show you the differ
ence."
So, loading another shell with a pri
mer of ordinary powder, it was let go
against the rock. This time there was
no chance for an argument. A roar
louder than that of the cannon came
back, while for hundreds of feet the
air was full of dust and flir* and
chunks of rock, some of them a ton in
weight, flew in every direction.
This fully established Tuttle's claim
that his powder surpassed dynamite in
explosive force. Tuttle's cannon, which
was made out of a car axle, was then
fir^d, using a shell about an inch in
diameter. It was aimed at a half-inch
steel plate 100 yards away. A sharp
hole was cut nearly through the plate,
to the surprise of the Entcliph officers.
Tuttle began experimenting witÂ£ ex
plosives two yeara ago, being requested
by friends to produce an explosive that
. could be us^d successfully in the Klon
dike. He says rec- -" his powder:
"It means the end of steel-clads.
With it shells can be sent through the
sides of warships as eaailv as solid shot
is now sent through, and, explodin" in
side the vessel, w<>ulJ tear it to atoms."
VANDALISM AT STANFORD.
Students Daub Paint Over Univer
sity Statuary. â¢
STANFORD, Feb. 20.â A few days ago
some student, or party of students, with
huge propensities for joking, daubed the
sphinxes guarding the entrance to the
university grounds with the class nu
meralsâ'o2. To efface the marks the au
thorities had the sphinxes repainted, but
the next morning the students got in their,
work again. Their latest efforts in the
line of art have been to bedaub the classic
statues on the top of the museum ana to
leave their marks, two Greek letters, on
the door of President Jordan's private of
fice The faculty has an inkling jvho the
perpetrators are. and should their sus
picion prove true the gentlemen of the
brush will be expelled and their names
published.
â 
Recriminations continued between
Count d'Almenas and Lieutenant Gen
eral Correa, the Minister of War, and
there was renewed disorder.
Then General Primo de Rivera arose
and denounced Count d'Almenas as a
"contemptible calumniator." General
Blanco l'nllowed, defending the gener
als and accepting full responsibility for
events in Cuba during his command in
the island. General Barges also de
nounced. Count cl'Almenas as a calumni
ator.
After a promise on the part of
Count d'Almenas to produce proofs of
his assertions to-morrow the Senate ad
journed.
In the Chamber the resolution of con
dolence of France over the death of
President Faure was unanimously
adopted.
Senor Silvela moved a vote signed by
the Conservative Deputies censuring
this Government for its indifference to
the country's troubles.
Senor Annix, in seconding: the motion,
denounced the Ministry for accepting
the war through fear of the Carlists.
and declared that the country was now
suffering the consequences of the Gov
ernment's pusillanimity. He proceeded
to detail the lack of preparations and
of war materials, and charged the Gov
ernment with responsibility for the sur
render of Santiago, "which they or
dered, although the garrison there num
bered 23,000 and there was sufficient
provisions in the place for three
months."
This declaration created a sensation.
In proof that the Government was re- j
sponsible for the surrender of Cuba
Senor Annix read telegrams from Senor
Sagasta and Lieutenant General Correa
to General Blanco ordering the sur
render of Cuba as a means of saving
Porto Rico and the Philippines and pre
serving order in the peninsula. He also
read General Blanco's telegram in re
ply, opposing the surrender, but agree
ing to obey the Government's order.
Senor Annix added that President i
McKinley had telegraphed to General
Shafter that the surrender of Santiago
had been arranged with the Madrid
Government, and that, therefore, he
must make a sort of sham attack.
Captain Aunon, Minister of Marine, !
interposed at this point, saying he be
lieved this story to be incorrect; where- i
upon Senor Annix repeated the state- j
ment that Premier Sagasta had ordered
the surrender of Cuba in order to save
the monarchy.
GOLD FOUND ON
MOUNTAIN TOPS
Rich Bench Claims Near
Dawson.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 13 (via Seat
tle, Feb. 16). â "Jack" Hanley, now here,
fourteen and a half days from Dawson,
Is much chagrined at not having beaten
ihe record but. He is one of the lucky
young men who have all the gold they
can dig out of the ground in the next
two or three years. It has been some
time since a gold story has come out
of Dawson. Hanley says some of the
bench claims, almost literally on top of
the mountains, are proving as rich as
many in the bottoms of the creeks, and
this fact almost takes the breath out
of the bodies of old miners, it is so un
precedented. One of these top-moun
tain claim owners, Martin Walstad, is
now here and sick. Neither of these
young men know how much he is
worth. Both knocked around Juneau
several years, taking what work they
could get in winter to buy grub to pros
pect on in summer, not knowing the
store of gold ahead of them.
Hanley says the total output of the
Klondike mines next clean-up in the
spring will exceed that of last year by
several millions. One reason for this
is that a good deal of ground was not
worked last year on account of the
royalty. Hope of its being reduced
soon has been abandoned and succeed
ed by the conclusion that life is too
short and there is too much of a good
time ahead to wait longer on the possi
bility of saving a few thousand dollars.
The situation at Dawson is about the
same. The town is comparatively
quiet.
"They are not coming in bunches as
they were last winter." is the way Han
ley puts it. "Still Dawson is all right
and will be a good camp for some
years, but I do not think it ever again
will be the town it was last winter and
summer."
This supports the statement made to
me by another Klondiker two weeks
ago, that Dawson has seen her best
days.
Klondiker Hanley said experienced
miners would never prospect in Cana
dian territory again, which accounts
for so many going to Eagle City and
elsewhere down the Yukon. This is
on account of the royalty, the licensee
required, the size of claims (250 feet),
with ten claims below Discovery re
served by the crown, as well as every
alternate ten claims.
Many men are still out of work at
Dawson, but they have plenty of food.
Hundreds are on the trail coming out.
The trail is in good shape and travel
ing comparatively easy.
Some new towns are springing up
on the river. At the present rate of
development there will be towns in a
year or two not very far apart all the
way to Dawson. Quite a settlement is
springing up at the mouth or the Ste
wart River and another at Thistle
Creek. Substantial buildings are be
ing erected. Hanley says he talked
with several acquaintances on the way
out who had claims on Thistle Creek
and all expected good pay in the spring.
Canadian mall has gone down the

CHARGES UNDER OATH
Declares That Bad Beef Was Supplied

to Prove the Assertion.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â The Miles
Court of Inquiry to-day made a good
start in its work. The court was com
fortably quartered in the old meeting
room of the War Investigation Com
mittee in the Lemon building, with ac
commodations for representatives of
the press associations and the local pa
pers. Calls of ceremony on the Presi
dent and the general commanding the
army occupied a large part of the fore
noon, and immediately thereafter Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles appeared as the
first witness. He and three other army
officers summoned as witnesses were
examined and disposed of before the
court closed its session at 3 o'clock.
General Miles' testimony, of course, was
the feature of the day's proceedings.
Colonel Frank Micheler, his chief of
staff, and a gentleman in citizen's
clothes, who took a seat by the fire
place and gravely watched the course
of proceedings, retiring with the gen
eral as silently as he had come, ac
companied the general to the court
room.
General Miles appeared in fatigue
uniform, rather striking in its contrast
with the display of scarfs, bullion and
buttons on the full dress uniforms of
the court. He submitted to the ques
tioning of Colonel Davis, recorder of
the court, with equanimity, except for
a flash of mingled indignation and
irony when he informed the recorder
that he was not compelled to "report"
to the commissary general of the army, j
This was in reply to a question as to
whether or not he had reported to the
Commissary Department the fact that
complaints had been made to him as !
to the quality of meat being issued to
the troops. An instant later General
Miles resumed his cool and carefully j
considered replies to the inquiries of <
the court.
As indicated by a letter of the ad- j
jutant general, read by the recorder j
for the informa- I
â â¦â¦ â  Â®+ tion of the court,
* ti,Â« n â¢ T th e scope of the

v â¦ mission as to
"â¦*** ; *"*" the quality of
the army beef, "and the matter pur
porting to have been furnished to the
public press by the same official."
Only two interviews were called up |
by the court, the first an interview with
_ New York Journal representative i
early in the beef controversy, in which
General Miles was quoted as charging
that certain chemicals were used in the
preservation of the army meat, and an- i
other of the New York Herald , under j
date of. February 1, covering about, the
same ground.
General Miles was very slow and
careful in his replies to the recorder's
questions on this point. He called at
tention to the fact that in both in
stances he was credited in the inter* j
views with refusing to answer certain
questions and insisted that these re- |
fusals should be given due weight in
considering the questions to which he j
did reply. He said, in the case of th =
interview of February 1, that he had a \
letter from the man who wrote the
story, offering to swear that General j
Miles had refused to be interviewed and \
that the whole story was made up in j
the jiffies from the writer's general j
knowledge of the facts. Notwithstand
ing this, when his final answer was
asked as to the authenticity of the in
terview. General Miles did not speci- |
fically deny it, but merely said that j
it did' not quite fairly represent his own
opinion in the case. The same quali
fied denial as to the Journal interview
of December 23 was made, leaving the
witness on record as not assuming any
responsibility for the newspaper state- ,
ments, but tacitly admitting that there
was a good deal in them with which he
agreed.
The trend of questions put to the
other witnesses of the day indicated j
that so long as they agreed with Gen- ,
eral Miles as to the quality of meat j
furnished the troops in the field, the
only criticism of their position the court
had to make was why they had not j
taken some official steps to have tile
matter remedied at the time. In every
instance the reply was that the circum- j
stances in which the army was placed,
in a sickly forciern country, with a large i
amount of fighting and a great scarcity
of transportation on hand, precluded
the possibility of any such, action. ; In j
each Instance the question was pushed
no further on this line.
It was said after the court adjourned
that Dr. Daly, whose original "em
balmed beef" report was the genesis or
the meat controversy, probably would
appear at to-morrow's session. after 10

CLAUS SPRECKELS'
GIFT TO APTOS
Donates a Site for a School and
Will Erect a Building
Upon It.
APTOS, Feb. 20.â There is great rejoic
ing here to-day In the households where
press, who were accorded places in the
courtroom, had assembled, and on the
outside were many other correspondents
and a number of artists specially detailed
to attend the inquiry. ,
During the morning several army 01
--ficers, who are in the city as witnesses,
reported to Colonel Davis, the recorder,
but remained only a few moments at the
rooms of the court.
The court returned at 12:05 from its ;
visits of courtesy and after two pho- |
tographers made pictures of the body >
Colonel Davis announced readiness to
proceed and read the orders convening
the court and its instructions.
Following the reading of the > order,
which has been published already. Col
onel Davis read a letter from Adjutant
General Corbin, in : response to a letter
from General Wade, president of the
court, explaining more specifically the
lines along which the court was expected
to investigate.
The court was then sworn aril Major
General Miles was presented as the first
witness. He appeared in fatigue uniform
and was sworn. After stating his rank
and office he was asked about his state
ment before the War Commission. He
said he made one, and on Colonel Davis
submitting a printed report of that state
ment General Miles examined and ap
proved it. Then he was asked about an
alleged interview which appeared in the
New Jork Journal of December 23, and
whether it represented completely or In
part what he said. General Miles read
ft. Then he said:
"I do not recall anything: in that inter
view that had not been given in ray testi
mony or transmitted in my reports. You
will observe it contains a number of my
declinations to name officers or my au
thorities and refusals to answer. It must,
therefore, be incorrect in its representa
tion."
He then commented upon the general,
though slight, inaccuracy of newspaper
' interviews, owing
| -â¦â <Â»> ' <$>â¦ to the dependen-
T*> cy of writers up-
General Miles on , their memo
ries. Hardly a
_â,! day in six months
ana had passed that
â¢â  â¢ _ an interviewer
the Press. â¢ had not applied to
$> " â¦ him, and because
+<$> â  .. $.+ of the kindness of
the press to the
army, and especially to the enlisted men,
he had endeavored to give them such in
formation as he thought wise' and safe,
but never, he said, with a view to preju
dicing "any one against any person or de
partment. Finally General Miles said he
: did not think the Journal interview rep
resented correctly what he had said, be
cause its contents should be taken in con
nection with all that was saidâ silence
upon some points, speech upon others.
Being asked as to an interview in the
New York Herald of February 1, he said:
"I have a letter from the gentleman
who, I understand wrote this, who stated
that he was willing to swear that I de
clined to be interviewed and that, think
ing something had to be given out, he had
proceeded to write what he know were
the facts."
He then pointed out that the interview
was erroneous in that it represented him
as having said that he had overwhelming
evidence that the refrigerated beef was
treated with chemicals. The fact was that
his only evidence was what was contained
In the reports of officers and the state
ments of men who claimed that the beef
had the odor of an embalmed body, that
they had seen fluid injected into beef and
other indications of chemical treatment.
He declared the interview an erroneous
presentation of what he . could possibly
have said.
Colonel Davis, recurring to the state
ment of General Miles before the War
| Commission, asked him what his idea as
to the beef supply for the army was when
! war broke out. Replying, General Miles
i said that, while his attention was occu
: pied with weighter matters of mobiliza
tion and equipment of troops, he felt con
â  fident that the usage of 100 years would
be followed and cattle herds would be
' shipped to the army in the
I tropics and killed there, .Hist as they were
during the civil war in the South, and also
j in Arizona. Texas and in Mexico, where
j it was so hot that soldiers could not sit
upon the rocks. He understood that
Cuba and Porto Rico are excellent grass
countries, and that cattle' could be shipped
and kept in prime condition. He re
i viewed his action in cabling the depart
j ment to send no more refrigerated beef to
! Porto Rico while he was there, as he had
I found it possible to use beef on the hoof.
General Miles said that he undertood
that our troops in Porto Rico were still
being supplied
><& <Â§>â¦ with a form of
a â¬> refrigerated beef.
Refrigerator although the
country was

Not Needed. I cattle there were
<Â£, -. ".-â Â£â ; Â« <& plentiful and the
I +<$>â -<&-f Spanish troops
drew all their
I meat supply from this source.
Colonel Davis asked if General Miles
! knew whether Porto Rico exported any
cattle Witness said it did to the num
ber of several thousand, and they were
fine cattle. Still, he understood that
' our troops were not only receiving re
i frigerated beef at the coast, but it was
! being sent into the interior. The situa
tion now, he said, was different from
: that during the war. Now there were
i ice machines on shore. Then there
1 was not ice enough for the hospitals.
Recurring to the expediency of feed
ing the troops hoof beef in Porto Rico,
General t Miles said he was much in
! favor of it. He said native beef killed
lat night could be fed to the men next
I "Do you think," continued Colonel
Davis "that the native beef would keep
as well as the refrigerated beef in the
absence of cooling apparatus on shore?"
"I am quite sure it would, unless the
' refrigerated beef was chemically treated
i with preservatives. If it was treated so
as to keep seventy-two hours after com
ing out of the coolers, of course it had the
advantage of the native beefâ so far as
1 "General Miles in his testimony also said
his use of the phrase "pretense of experi
ment " in speaking of army beef, was un
i fortunate. He disclaimed intending any
I inference of fraud and said he should
! have said the refrigerated beef issued
was "on the ' theory of an experiment "
and "a very costly one." â¢:
General Miller said :he did not recollect
whether Dr. Daly's report was volun
teered or whether he had been ordered to
investigate and report on the meat.
It was general talk among the officers

ceived that Clau-s Spredkels has donated
a splendid site for a school and will erect
a building upon it in keeping with the
growth of this community.
Mr. Spreckels learned that the building
now in use was old and entirely inade
quate to supply the demands made upon
it. In addition to this the site was not a
desirable one for a place growing as
rapidly as is this one. The trustees of the
school learned of Mr. Spreckels 1 benefi
cence to-day. He has already instructed
Reid Brothers, the architects who de
signed the tall ClauÃ Spreckels building
in San Francisco, to prepare plans for
at Ponce, General Miles continued, that
the refreigrerator beef must have been
subjected to some chemical treatment to
make it keep for seventy-two hours. Dr.
Daly's, however, was the first official re
port. ~ â  '
General Miles then read a long summary
of a hundred letters received by him at

In addition he showed a summary of re
ports on refrigerated beef condemned and
thrown overboard from transports. C. C.
Yeamans from the Yosemite reported the
condemnation of 8000 pounds: Lieutenant
Colonel ONell of the steamship Chester,
4000 pounds; Colonel James Hamilton
Lewis, 10.000 pounds. . ' ' :'
He said that he should fix September
21 (the date of Dr. Daly's report) as about
the earliest at which the question of
chemically treated meat had been
brought to his notice 30 as to command
his full attention.
Colonel Gillespie took a hand in the In
quiry when General Miles finished, de
scribing the nauseating qualities of the
canned and refrigerated beef.
"Did you. general, ever eat of this
beef?" Colonel Gillespie asked. *
"I presume I did about the time we
were at Ponce," said General Miles, with
some hesitation. "Yes. I presume I did."
"Then," said Colonel Gillespie, "it had
not such characteristic qualities as would
permit you to detect It offhand?"
"No, sir."
General Miles then left the witness

of the Thirteenth

. said* he .had used
all kinas, canned, corned, refrigerated
and canned roast beef. He said the criti
cisms of the canned roast beef began
early and were made often. It was ob
jected to on the score of its lack of nutri
ment, its taste and its appearance. After
the men got cooking utensils they stewed
their canned beef. Before that they ate
it from the can. Either way of serving |
it was bad enough, and, though none of |
it that witness remembered was actually
spoiled, it was unpalatable and the ground
of constant complaint.
Witness did not recollect that the large
sick list of this regiment in Cuba had
been laid at the time to the canned meat.
The men were very debilitated, but he
could not say whether the meat ought to
be blamed or. not. When the refrigerator
beef arrived a large part of it was spoil
ed and the men continued to use the
canned meat. The spoiled refrigerator
beef was raid out on the hill for the buz
zards. Several issues were lost in this
way. Witness had eaten some of the re
frigerator beef which arrived in camp j
untainted and found that good. The men '
ate it without complaint, and he had no I
reason to believe it was any different
from the beef he had got at army posts
in the States.
Lieutenant Colonel Charles Minor of the
Sixth Infantry was the next witness. His i
regiment was among the first to leave
Camp Thomas and to camp at Tampa.
They reached Cuba and disembarked on |
June 22. Canned roast beef was issued as
a travel ration when they left Tampa and
until the end of the siege. It was re
placed with refrigerated beef after the
surrender. Meantime, he said, absolutely
no other fresh meat could have been fur
nished during the siege.
Complaints against the canned beef be
came general and marked about' July 2.
He said he was using it and when opened
it was apparently fresh, but stringy and
absolutely without nourishment, and
when cut it fell to pieces. The men could
not and did not eat it.
"I believed then and I believe now," he
said, "that that beef had been used for
making beef extract and the nutriment
taken out. It appeared to have been
boiled to pieces."
Colonel Minor said he knew nothing of
the method of canned beef preparation.

They had no discretion or choice in the
matter of rations. â¢â â¢:â ', _^ * _
Examined as to refrigerated beef he de- |
clared it was excellent and satisfactory
and no complaints about it were heard, j
Only one i mart or was spoiled. He was i
unable he said to detect any difference
between the refrigerated beef Isuea in
Cuba and that which had been issued at
the posts in this country at which he had
been , stationed.
Major Henry Jackson, Third Cavalry,
who was with his regiment throughout
the Santiago campaign, was called. He
said his experience with the canned roast
beef began aboard the transport en route
for Cuba and continued until his return
to Montauk. Complaints commenced on
the way down and continued without in
termission. The men complained of the
meat being stringy, tasteless and unpala
table. The officers had remarked the
same thing to him and ,he agreed with
them fully. ; .
Colonel Davis asked if witness .had made
any effort to get different meat for his
men He replied that there was nothing
to do but take what was issued. There
was no requisition or other formality. All
the rations that could be sent to the front
with the limited transportation) facilities
were sent; The men simply took what
was sent them and officers and men fared
alike. When the fresh or refrigerated
beef began to arrive after the capture of
Santiago it was issued to the men. So
far as witness observed it was good.
the It will be modern in all its
appointments and will be a credit alike
to its donor and to those who will prepare
for the great battle of life within its
walls.

There $6 not the least doubt now that

Hepburn does not feel that there should

NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â The Washing

Cassini, Russian Embassador to the
United States, an interview in answer
to the statements made by Lord Charles
Beresford relative to the establishment
of an open door in China.
Count Cassini was transferred from
Peking to Washington after five and a

respecting Lord Beresford's statements
the Embassador said of the report pub

between Russian and Chinese troops at
Talien Wan 300 of the latter were
killed: "I do not believe the report. If
there had been any foundation for it I
would have been immediately advised
of the facts by my Government. The
Chinese have no troops at Talien V, an
and a conflict could not therefore have
occurred." Â

Beresford does not say at present there
exists a closed door, but says that it
is possible that in future there may be
a closed door. As a matter of fact
China holds in her hands authority to
declare whether there shall be an open
or a closed door.
"So far as Russia is concerned it is
to her interest to have free trade in the
Far East. It is necessary in view of the
construction of the trans-Siberian rail
! road that there should be an extension
t of commercial relations in order that
the road can be operated on a paying
basis.
"The policy of Russia in the extreme
Orient has always favored the introduc
tion of foreign commerce on an equal
footing. Vladivostok is maintained as
a free port. Talien Wan, which ife within
the Russian sphere of influence in
China, is to-day a free port.
"Lord Charles Beresford states that
Russia wants to take possession of the
north of China and leave the south of
that country to France. Now he pro
poses that England, the United States,
Germany and Japan shall take charge
of affairs in China, England to have
control of the army, customs, etc., a
very natural desire from his point of
view.
"Why does he make exceptions of
Russia and France? He does so on the
ground that they are not commercial
peoples. This is a mistake. France is
a commercial nation and Russia will be.
The Siberian road is a commercial idea.
He says it is built only for strategic rea
sons. T-his is another mistake."
NEALL'S RAPID
CAREER AT RENO
Lieutenant Left Many
Creditors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, New, Feb. 20.â Lieutenant
"Jack" M. Neall. whose sudden disap
pearance from the Presidio has created
such a furor in San Francisco, haa a
little history in Reno which by way of
coincidence sheds some light upon" the
episodes before the public-
Lieutenant Neall lived in Reno for
four years, ending 1894, and in the ca
pacity of military Instructor and all
around professor at the Nevada Uni
versity won the esteem and good will
of nearly all the best people here. His
affable, genial ways gained the devotion
of the students who attended his
classes. But his Nemesis overtook him
and much of this popularity was lost
when the time came for his departure
hence and he was called upon to settle
accounts. It then developed that his
mania for gambling and for a fast life
generally had led - him into debt and
when he left here bankers, merchants,
saloon-keepers and people of many
classes were his creditors in sums vary
ing from $1 to $100 or more, and aggre
gating over U2OO, The Washoe County
Bank was about the only one of these
claimants which held any security bet
ter than Neall's fickle word.
[ The bank got its money, but C. Nova
covich. the grocer; W. O. H. Martin the
general merchant; H. J. Theys, the
saloon-keeper, and many others had ac
counts against Neall that could not be
collected. Efforts were made through
the War Department and through in
j slstent collecting agencies, but finally
! the greater portion of these claims were
charged to profit and loss.
Neall's reputation as an efficient
teacher of military tactics as well as
ether branches In which he had. classes
was first class, and aside from his un
fortunate sporting proclivities he would
have ranked here among the best.

LUMBER AND THE
ALASKA BOUNDARY
Stumbling Blocks of the
Joint Commission.
AN ADJOURNMENT TAKEN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â The Ameri
can-Canadian joint high commission,
after a session to-day, adjourned to
meet at (Juebec, August 2, unless the
chairmen of the respective commissions
agree upon another date. There were
several reasons which prompted the ac
tion taken to-day.
From a statement made public with
the sanction of the two commissions it
appears there were serious differences
of opinion between them regarding the
important matter of the delimitation of
the Alaskan boundary, the Canadians
in this connection being anxious to ob
tain a seaport in Lynn canal so that its
shippers would not be subjected to the
petty annoyances which they asserted
they experienced at the hands of United
States officials. Then the time for the
meeting cf the Canadian Parliament, at
which the presence of members of the
commission from that country is de
sired, is overdue, and the latter are
anxious to return as soon as possible.
It also became apparent that there was
little likelihood of ratification by the
United States Senate at the present ses
sion of any treaty which might be
framed, which also probably figured in
the decision to adjourn.
A dozen important questions were re
ferred to the commission for its con
sideration and the commissioners state
that substantial progress In the settle
ment and adjustment of many of the
questions has been made. Probably
those which have given the most seri
ous trouble and proved a stumbling
block to a final agreement on all have
been the two relating to lumber and the
Alaskan boundary question, on both of
which the Canadians have demanded
concessions which the Americans felt
it would be prejudicial to the best in
terests of the United States to grant.
It was felt also that an adjournment
for a few months might result in a bet
ter prospect for harmony and a dispo
sition on the part of the Canadians to
agree to propositions made to them by
the commissioners on this side of the
boundary line.
Senator Bairbanks, chairman of the
American commission, has repeatedly
stated that there was no basis for the
reports of a rupture in the relations of
the two bodies and to-night supple
mented this by saying that they were
on the best of terms. On behalf of their
respective commissions Senator Fair
banks, the chairman of the American
board, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, acting
chairman in the absence of Lord Her
schell, who is ill, of the Canadian board,
made the following public statement
respecting the action taken to-day:
The commission adjourned to meet at
Quebec August 2 unless the chairmen of
the respective committees shall agree
upon another date. The commission has
made very substantial progress in the set
tlement and adjustment of many of the
?;utstions upon which it has been earnest
y engaged. But it has been unable to
agree upon the settlement of the Alaskan
boundary. This problem is complicated
and difficult, but the commissions, acting
in the utmost friendliness and cordiality,
have been unable to agree upon a satis
factory adjustment. The difficulties, apart
from the immediate delimitation of this
boundary by the commission itself, arise
from the conditions under which it might
be referred to arbitration. The British
commissioners desired that the whole
question should be referred on terms sim
ilar to those provided in the reference of
of the Venezuela boundary line and which
by providing sin umpire would insure cer
tainty and finality. The United States
commissioners, on the other hand,
thought the local conditions in Alaska so
different that some modifications of the
Venezuelan boundary reference should be
introduced. They thought the reference
should be made to the six eminent jur
ists, three chosen by each of the high
contracting parties, without providing- for
an umpire, they believing that flnality
would be secured by a majority vote of
the jurists so chosen. They did not see
any present prospect of agreeing to a
European umpire to be selected in the
manner proposed by the British commis
sioners, while the British commissioners
were unwilling to agree to the selection
of an American umpire in the manner
suggested by the United States commis
sioners. The United States commissioners
further contended that special stipula
tions should be made in any reference
to arbitration that the existing /settle
ments on the tidewaters of the coast
should in any result continue to belong to
the United States. To this contention the
British commissioners refused to agree.
It was therefore deemed advisable to ad
journ to a convenient date in order to
enable the respective governments to fur
ther consider the subject with respect to
which no conclusion has yet been re
ported.
NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â An Ottawa,
Ont., special to the Herald says: Sir
Charles Tupper, leader of the Conserva
tive opposition, who has represented
Canada in several negotiations with the
United States, notably those of 1888
when the treaty was concluded which
was afterward thrown out by the
United States Senate, was asked to- |
night what he thought of the news
from Washington that the labors of the
joint high commission had come to
naught. He said:
No surprise will be felt in Canada at
the failure of the present negotiations,
because everybody here is aware that the
Government has not only exhibited com
plete incapacity to deal with such ques
tions and that their record was such as to
render it vain for a hope to get any fa
vorable consideration from the United ;
States To recall that they were the

WOMAN BATTLES
WITH THREE MEN
CL.OVERDALE, Feb. 20.â A criminal case was commenced in the
Justice Court here to-day which is arousing considerable interest.
About two years ago Charles Norman of San Francisco patented 160
acres of Government land six miles west of Cloverdale. He built a
cabin and remained there a few months, but not long enough, it is
claimed, to entitle him to the land according to the homestead laws.
C H. Hill and wife of San Francisco settled upon this abandoned
homestead a few months ago and were going though the regular pro
cess of law to claim it as their own when Norman appeared last Satur
day to order them off. He was accompanied by George J. Mathews, an
extensive land owner in the vicinity and James Clements
* Mr Hill not being at home, his wife met them at the door with a
shotgun and a positive refusal to leave the place. .Mathews and Nor
man tried to take the gun from her. She fought valiantly and in the
Â«triurele three of her ribs were broken, her hands terribly lacerated and
she was internally injured. Physicians are doubtful as to her recovery.
Warrants for the arrest of the three men were sworn out yester
day but for want of evidence on both sides the preliminary trial was
continued to-day by Judge Smith to March 6, and the defendants were
held under $5000 bonds each.

ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE TRACK-
â 
lIEUTENANT NEALL of the Fourth Cavalry
is now an exile, or. dead by his own hand, his I
. â * body rests somewhere beyond the reach of
searchers.
:" â¢-" This lieutenant was an able and popular officer.
His men had for him a feeling little less than affection.
/â¢â .They gladly obeyed his orders. They would have j
. â¢ followed him to the field of battle and felt that they I
;;had a leader. Among gentlemen in civil life, as in
;. .military, he found a ready welcome. He was edu- \
:..."Cated, genial, magnetic, and had a way of winning j
. friends. Yet now, so be that he is dead or wander
â lo.ing, there rests upon his name and honor the brand

â¢ cast aside.
It is worth while to inquire how ail this has hap
â¢ pened, and the explanation is easy. Lieutenant Neall
was merely another victim of the insatiate races j
. " Which every day furnish trap and bait, luring the j
:.. gullible to destruction. He thought he could win.
- He thought that by shrewd betting he could lift him
self from the pit into which extravagant habits had i
â¢ led him, and the result the inevitable result â the i
'. ' result which has become an old story â was the fate
â  awaiting him.
V. Add the name of Xeall to the long list. Add it i
to that of Widber, of Figel, of Norton, the suicide, j
1 and Welborn, the defaulter. There are countless more |
.- v.ho more quietly have achieved the loss of place and j
â¢ reputation and opportunity through these same
< races â a continual temptation, a bootless hope.
â¢ The downfall of Neall is a sad instance of that
.:. which a continual racing season is accomplishing j
1 â¢ for San Francisco. Does the public know that women
walk to the track so as to save their precious nickels
â¢to wager on some race which has. been decided before
. the start of the horses? Does it know that clerks and
bookkeepers clutch their salaries greedily so as to be
" able to give all to the cormorants of the track? Such
. are the simple, sorry facts.
, San Francisco pays daily thousands of dollars for
" the. support of an iniquitous institution which fattens j
: a lot of greedy and conscienceless speculators, here |
â  and there helps a '"plunger" to an unearned fortune, ;
. sustains a lot of vagrants and touts, the while doing
â¢'.no good to any legitimate industry, adding nothing
'.to "the sum of wealth, teaching nothing as to the art \
â¢ â  of breeding. And San Francisco is paying too high .
â¢a figure for disgrace, crime, pauperism. It is time
for. the racetracks to be limited in their capacity to
.rob. If permitted to operate a few days each year
they might do no harm. As institutions conducted
with no time limit, they have fearful power to at-
t tract and destroy. Neall is only a sample. There are
enough others to make the heart sick.

THE INTERESTS OF PARTY-
THE people who are attempting to force Dan
Burns into the Senate are suffering an acute
attack of party loyalty. The Record-Union
has discovered that the people demand a Republican
Senator and will punish the party if one is not de
livered. As this is the voice of the Southern Pacific
Railroad, we desire to answer it. that there would
have been a Republican Senator early in the session
if the Southern Pacific Railroad had kept faith with
the people and made good the word of the Republican
part}- that that corporation was out of politics, (/rant
ing the great necessity for the election of a Republican
Senator, the seat to be filled in the Senate belo
to the party and the people and not to the Southern
Pacific Railroad. No friend of that company, no
stockholder in it, no decent man authorized to S]
for it, can give any reason or make any apology tor
its selection of Dan Burns and its attempt to elect
him Senator. No such thing was dreamed oi before
the election. Had it been hinted at the Republican
party would have lost the State, li he is elected now
no power on earth can save the State to the party in
iooo. Every man of sense connected with the rail
road knows this. To elect Burns means sure defeat
Ihe Record-Union shivers with fear of what may
nay come if no Senator is elected. We agree with it
that one should be chosen. But an Oregon Repub
lican Legislature refused to eleel an objectionable
man, and rather than do a disgraceful thing did noth
ing. The people did not punish the party for it.
On the contrary, they doubled its majority at the ,
next election and enabled it to elect a decent man j
and statesman to the Federal Senate.
Things are at a bad stage if the people are ready to
kill a party for being decent, but will give it further
confidence only on condition that it will be dirty.
We repeat, let the Southern Pacific Company draw
out of this fight, let the Legislature alone and attend
t i its railroad business, and there can be a Republican
Senator in forty-eight hours.
We and the whole Republican press insisted last
fall that the railroad was out of Â£>olitics. So did Gov
ernor Gage and every candidate and speaker of the
Republican party. We don't know how others feel
about it, but we don't like the railroad to make as a!!
liars.
THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
THE Stanford University, which is magnificently
endowed for higher education, although not a
State institution, in any legal sen^e, must always
| be an object of pride and of solicitude to the people
of the State, and we appreciate and admire the en
thusiasm of men who, for its benefit, are willing to
I turn a section of a State constitution into a piece of
special legislation. Still we are compelled to adhere
, to the opinion we expressed some weeks ago against
I the exemption of the property of the university from
' taxation. The question of State aid to institutions of
i learning and of tlje relief of property used for that
purpose from the burden of taxation was much dis
cussed and considered in the Constitutional Conven
tion of 1879. The conclusions of that body were ex
pressed in the constitution adopted in that year as it
now exists, and are a part of the system then devised
for the avowed object of equalizing the pressure of
taxation. By article IV, section 22, all appropriations
for institutions not under the exclusive management
j and control of the State, except those caring for or
phans, half-orphans, abandoned children and indigent
persons, are expressly prohibited. By article X, section
â¢ 9, it will be seen that even the University of California
: is not entirely a State institution, but that it is declared
to be a ''public trust," subject partly to legislative
control. By section 12 of article XI the Legislature is
debarred from doing more than vesting in counties,
1 towns and cities by general laws the power of assess
irg and collecting taxes for local use. Article XIII,
section 1. enacts that "all property in the State, not ex
! empt under the laws of the United States, shall be
taxed," and the sixth section of the same article pro
vides that "the power of taxation shall never be sur
i rendered or suspended by any grant or contract to
i which the State shall be a party."
These quotations suggest at least the derangements
that would inevitably flow from the exemption of the
Stanford University, and of the colossal fortune it
i represents, from all compensation for the protection
it receives under the law. The property from which
the income of the university is derived is situated in
different counties and is a competing factor in some of
the chief industries of the State. The escape of that
property from taxation would deprive those counties
I of needed income and would increase the burden of
I other property owners in particular localities, so that
gross inequality would be the consequences. Even
I though the Stanford University were technically a
! Siate institution, this would be unjust Any advau
i tage it might derive over other owners of property
I should be held at least to an equitable basis, and
i should be charged proportionately to the whole num
: her within the State. Nor should competitors in
I business be exposed to the inequality of paying their
taxes while the Stanford University is set free.
We are reluctantly opposed, therefore, to the pro
posed amendment to relieve the Stanford University
from taxation. If any such exemption could be tole
-1 rated, it ought to apply to all similar institutions, and
! be formulated in a general proposition that in its
! application would leave to the Legislature the exer
! cise of a reasonable discretion. In recent years State
1 constitutions, instead of supplying brief and compre
; hensive limitations and directions, have been lavishly
: employed for special legislation. This is a radical
[ objection to the amendment under discussion, but so
far as the investment of the Stanford University with
power to receive donations from any source is con-
I ctrned, upon the showing made we see no escape from
.; the conclusion that the amendment should be pro-
I posed and adopted.
THE INITIATIVE fIND THE REFER
ENDUM.
WHILE the Populists and their allies are talk
ing of making a campaign of education in the
State in favor of the incorporation into our
political system of the initiative and the referendum,
it appears the operation of our constitution has vir
tually brought the system into vogue already.
The constitution removes from the Legislature and
embodies in the organic law so many matters requir
ing revision from time to time that the submission
tc the people of proposals for amending the constitu
tion has become a common practice. At every State
election there has been for a number of years past
several such amendments to be voted upon. This
practice is in the fullest sense of the word the use of
the referendum, and the range of questions which it
covers is about as broad as any one except an ex
tremist can desire.
The constitution does not provide for the initiative,
but the evolution of politics has of itself brought
that about. The submission of constitutional amend
ments has become so common that there is now
hardly any serious objection to the practice. Even
persons who are opposed to the particular measure
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1899.
proposed are generally in favor of submitting it and
giving the people an opportunity to vote upon it.
As a result of this condition of public sentimen.t the
people have a large power of initiative. When any
considerable number of influential persons desire a
constitutional amendment submitted to .the popular
vote, they can obtain the concession without much
difficulty. It is not incumbent upon them to show
that any particular proportion of the voters desire to
have the issue submitted. It is simply necessary to
demonstrate by petition or otherwise that a strong
body of citizens favor the proposition in order to
get the Legislature to concede it.
In most States of the Union the popular vote on
constitutional amendments does not amount to an
effective referendum, because comparatively few sub
jects are covered by the organic law. In California,
however, the State constitution is more like a code of
laws than a true constitution, and accordingly there is
in it a wide variety of issues to be submitted to the
popular vote. The practice has now become so well
settled it will hardly be broken up, and although pro
posals to amend the constitution are nearly always
beaten at the polls, we shall unquestionably have such
questions submitted in greater or less numbers at
every election so long as the present constitution
.stands.
THE SENATORIAL SCANDALS.
IT IS doubtful whether any proposition in politics
was ever more thoroughly settled than the very
late one o! electing United States Senators by pop
ular vote. There is no question that if the Federal
Senate is to continue to enjoy the respect of
the country and its legislation to receive the acquies
cence <>i the masses a change will have to be effected
in the mode of electing its members.
It is really getting so that a Senator who reaches
his station without scandal becomes a veritable curi
ositj among statesmen. Outside the old States, where
some of the traditions of the fathers still con
tinue to be the rule of action, no United States Sena
tors are elected nowadays without the assistance of
money, political corruption and debauchery.
Things have been a little worse this year than ever
before. In three Western Legislatures not only have
there been open charges of bribery, but investigating
committees have actually accumulated evidence to
sustain them. Only the other day a candidate before
the Utah Legislature was accused of offering $1500
a vote, and less than a month ago a member of the
Montana Legislature walked to the Speaker's desk
and handed over a roll of greenbacks, which had been
given him by another candidate. In the California
Legislature two members have been convicted of ac
cepting the money of a Senatorial candidate prior to
the election, and in both cases the moral turpitude
.of the act has not seemed to shock anybody.
It is impossible that such things as these should
continue and the principal legislative body of the
country survive. Either the power to elect Senators
must be taken from the Legislatures, which have
proved entirely unworthy of the trust, or a radical
change is bound to take place in the character of the
Federal Senate. It is incredible that men who reach
positions in that body by the use of money can be
come honest or trustworthy afterward. No stream
ever rose above its source. A debauched and cor
rupted Legislature never produced a Senator capable
of representing an honest and moral people.
The question is, how to bring this reform about.
Petitions and mass meetings have been suggested,
and perhaps in their way they might do some good.
Votes of the people which, so far as taken, indicate
an overwhelming public sentiment in favor of a
change, might also tend to produce the reform. But
something stronger than all this is necessary. If the
people knew the danger which beset them of having
ultimately a Senate composed entirely of corruption
ists and boodlers, they would arise en masse and wipe
the reproach off the face of the country. Perhaps we
shall be forced to await the formation of a public
opinion that will manifest itself in this way. In the
meantime, . however, all good citizens should work
uniformly for the reform. The preservation of their
liberties demand that they should pull in this direc
tion all together.
PROSPECTS OF AN EXTRA SESSION.
SUCH conflicting reports come from Washington
concerning the outlook for an extra session of
Congress it would seem the issue is to be left
for time and chance to determine. Statements from
men high in authority show a wide disagreement.
Some are sanguine we shall have an extra session,
some are equally sanguine we shall not, while others
frankly admit they do not know.
Not long ago Secretary Alger was quoted as saying
if the army reorganization bill were not passed there
would surely be an extra session. Secretary Gage also
is reported as sharing that opinion. In a recent inter
view he is stated to have said: "Will there be an
extra session? That depends on the fate of the army
bill. If Congress does not pass that bill at this session
there will certainly be an extra session."
On the other hand, Senator Hanna is reported to
have stated to an interviewer in New York: "An ex
tra session is not at all probable. Our Democratic
friends would like to force us into one, so as to help
them 1 out of their free silver muddle, but they are
going to be disappointed on that score." Proceeding
further with the question and referring to the demand
for an extra session to deal with the issue of monetary
reform, the Senator is quoted as saying:
"Some of our financial men here in New York City
came over to Washington not long ago, urging an
extra session of Congress to pass monetary legislation.
When they realized what such a session would mean,
however, and heard the opinion of the country outside
of New York, they became entirely satisfied to trust
to the judgment of the administration. As I under
stand the present position, it is that nothing but an
emergency far beyond anything now in sight will
justify the President in calling Congress together,
possibly for the whole summer, and reopening debate
on all manner of questions."
This statement with respect to financial legislation
is not at all in accord with the views attributed to
Secretary Gage, who is reported to have said on the
occasion of his recent visit to Chicago:
"Financial reform is neither dead nor asleep. The
extraordinary prosperity of the Government finances
and of the business of the country has combined with
the glut of important business in Congress to delay it.
But the delay only adds to the sense of its importance,
and makes it clearer every day that legislation is
needed."
From the confusion of these reports the only con
clusion that can be drawn is that the administration is
keeping its own council, and is awaiting develop
ments. Despite the statements attributed to Senator
Hanna the chances are we shall have an extra session.
Some of the measures before Congress are too im
portant to be kept waiting, and it is not likely they can
be dealt with at this session. The people wish the
Nicaragua Canal bill, the Hawaiian Government bill,
the shipping bill and a currency reform bill enacted
into law; and their postponement for another year
would be a grass blunder.
TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
FROM BOYS AT SEA
Clock Given The Call by the Monterey's Crew.
IF a thing of beauty is a joy forever.
The Call office will never know sor
row. It has received from the crew
of the Monterey, most graciously and
unexpectedly bestowed, a gift which
while in itself valuable, the finest work
of the skilled craftsman, gains an addi
tional vaiue from the method of its be-
Btowal. The brief letter accompanying
it explains fully the motive, but it mod
estly avoids any reference to the quality
(ri the present.
Probably there is not in America an
other such clock, perhaps not another in
the world, like that brought by the Va
lencia. It is in the form of a warship,
very suggestive. of the Monterey, only the
hull is proportionately higher. The hull
duwn to the water line is of blued steel,
and below of brass polished to mirror
luster. Fore and aft are turrets, each
mounting two guns. The turrets are of
steel, capped and embellished with shin
ing brass. The forward one has upon one
side a clock, and the after one a barom
eter. Both turrets revolve constantly.
Upon the two smokestacks, finished also
in steel and brass, are thermometers,
one Fahrenheit and the other centigrade.
Chains of brass encircle the capstan and
depend on either side. The capstan is
surmounted by a compass scientifically
correct. The anchor chains and the an
chors are of steel or nickel, as are the
guns protruding warlike from the sides
of the hull. The steering gear is com
plete and the propeller whirls unceasing
ly. The rudder is of brass, with steel
straps, and all over the miniature vessel
every bolt is in place, and every rivet.
This tiny Monterey is equipped with a
ram which dn a real vessel would carry
terror to the enemy. The guard rail la
of silver ropes upheld by brass posts.
Not a detail has been omitted. At the
prow a metal Union Jack makes a pre
tense of waving, and at the stern the
stars and stripes do the same. The
whole artistic mechanism is mounted on
a pedestal of green onyx set off with gold,
and on one side is an ornate silver plate
bearing the inscription:
"Presented to the San Francisco Call by
the crew of the l r . S. S. Monterey, Ma
nila, P. 1., January, 1899."
One strange feature of the ship is that
there is nowhere on it a mark whereby
can be learned what cunning hands
wrought it. But the work would be a
credit to the genius of any nationality.
The clock will be on exhibition at the of
fice of The Call to-day, and it is well
worth seeing.
The Call thanks the gallant crew of
the Monterey. California takes pride in
the ship and the men aboard of her, and
this gift Is appreciated more for what it
indicates even than for its intrinsic
worth, its rarity and Its usefulness.
SUPERVISORS
RECONSIDER
APPROPRIATIONS
Restore the Hall of
Justice Fund.
â¢
The Supervisors at their meeting yester
day acted on two Important matters
squarely in opposition to Dr. Perrault. In
one instance the chairman of the Finance
Committee alone voted against a resolu
tion undoing some of his handiwork, while
in another he had only Supervisor Heyer's
vote in addition to his own. Mr. Lack
mann was excused from voting.
The first check in the supervisorial ca
reer of the medico representing- the Ninth
Ward was experienced when the matter
of the appropriation for furnishing the
Hall of Justice was presented to the board
in a different guise to that it had assumed
on a former occasion. At that time a res
olution, presented by Dr. Perrault, was
passed reducing the appropriation $20,000.
This, with an additional $43u0, was allowed
the County Clerk's office to meet a de
ficiency left as a legacy by the last ad
ministration. After a short discussion
yesterday the former action was rescind
ed and the. money was restored to the
fund for the furnishing of the Hall of
Justice. The resolution which brought
about this change of front was Introduced
by Supervisor Aigeltinger and reads:
Whereas, The Increase In the appropria
tion of the County Clerk made by resolu

The game of battledoor and shuttlecock
regarding the allowance of extra deputies
for Tax Collector Sheehan was contin
ued. The Finance Committee referred
the matter to the board without recom
mendation. Tho board promptly re
turned it to the committee, with full
power to act. After extended discussion
this latter action prevailed. Under the
ruling of Judge Hebbard in the Warren
case, as interpreted, the board has the
power to appoint the clerks. This power
it has delegated to the Finance Commit
tee. Mr. Sheehan asked for twenty-five
clerks, but the number to be allowed was
left with the committee.
Assessor Dodge applied for extra clerks
for March, and the matter was referred
to the Finance Committee.
The matter of granting the Market
Street Railway Company permission to

Riders Draw Down
Prize Money.
MILLER GETS A NEAT SUM
YELLOW GOLD IS PAID FOR A
".. - WEEK OF TORTURE.
Â»
Men Are Resting Up and Preparing
for the Twenty-Four Hour Con
test, Which Begins on
Friday Night.
The six-day riders are now enjoying
their hard-earned beauty sleep. This
was allowed them In homeopathic doses
â¢of a couple of hours at a time yesterday,
..when they were forcibly awakened and
kept awake for half an hour, and then
â¢permitted to take another snooze. The
trainers say that this is better for them
than a continuous sleep of ten or twelve
â¢hours, the first day after the race.
, None of the men will feel any immediate
.'.effects of the race after to-morrow,
.though what harm may result to
them in the years to come is hard to
foretell. The riders themselves have no
tear, however, and point to "Dutch"
.Waller, who is 44 years of age, and "Old
Man" Ashinger, who is near 50, as evi
dences of longevity in six-day riders.
The men were all up and about by yes
terday noon, apparently much refresheu
by their sleep, and, strange to say, they
ail went over to the Pavilion at different
.times during the day and took a look at
the track where they had tolled so hard.
The interesting ceremony of paying off
the racers took place at noon at the Pa
vilion and every rider personally pre
sented himself at that time except Gimm,
who went to pieces the last two days of
the race.
- The men were paid in the order of their
finish, and Miller came first. He received
$1500 as the first prize and $200 aditional
for breaking the world's record. Doubt
less as Miller's eyes lighted on the glitter
ing pile of golden double eagles he felt
.amply repaid for his week's suffering. His
little wife helped him pack it away, and
will probably also help him spend It.
Alter "cashing In" Miller went back to his
hotel for another short sleep, and says
that except for his knees being sore he is
â as fresh as when he started.
Plucky Oscar- Aronson was the second
man paid, receiving $1000. He, like the
others, had nothing to say save "Thank
you" when he received his money. He
has no wife to spend it on.
Fredericks, who wen third place, drew
down $600, and jolly Teddy Hale, the Irish
champion, received $400. Louis Gimm,
who looked to be the winner up to Thurs
.d'ay morning, got $300 for finishing in fifth
' place. Nawn $200 for sixth, Albert $150 for
â¢seventh and Barnaby $125 for eighth.
Pilkington. Lawson. Julius and Ashinger,
who did not come within the prize list.
were given $10*1 each for having covered
over KOO miles, besides having their ex
penses paid, and were profound in their
expressions of gratification at the liber
ality of the management.
These men will all start on a 24-hour
race next Friday night at 10 o'clock, fin
ishing at the same time Saturday night.
During* such a race, a veritable "sprint"
to these six-day men, they never leave
their wheels once during the ride, for a
dismount or a lost lap means a lost race,
and some Idea of the clip they cut out
can be imagined from the distance cov
ered In the last one in New York, a little
less than 800 miles, when the four leaders
finished in a mile sprint in 1:55 and were
hut inches apart at the tape. It was won
by mm, who has won every 24-hour race
in which he has ever started.
Charles A. Kraft of the Bay City Wheel- i
men, the crack road rider of California,
will start In the 24-hour race, for which I
"he has been training over a month, and j
should give a good account of himself.
â¢ The Pavilion was closed last night and !
will be closed to-night, to give the men ,
; and officials a much-needed rest. It will
reopen to-morrow night and continue open
the rest of the week. The card i
to-morrow night Is a very attractive one, |
Rnd includes a match race between Harry
Elkes, holder of the world's hour record,
and Floyd McFarland, the California
champion, at fifteen miles, paced by ten
tandem teams each. As both are good
followers of pace and like the distance
equally well, the race should be well con
tested. The knowing ones are backing
McFarland, saying that the distance is
lust right for him. but a bit too short
for [kea This is borne out by the state
ment of Elkes' father in The Call the
other day that his boy preferred matches
at from twenty to thirty-three miles. The
Eastern lad will be there all the time,
however, and if "Mac" wins it will only
be after a most gruelling race.
Besides this event there will be ama
teur and professional short-distance races
and the usual exhibitions and record
trials.
' Paced racing at middle distances is a
novelty to California racegoers, to-mor
row night's event being the first of the
kind ever run here.

PLUCKY RACER A WRECK
UGLY RUMORS OF TRICKERY
ARE WHISPERED ABOUT.
Unfortunate Wheelman Said to Have
Been Drugged to Save Money of
Gamblers Wagered on
His Opponents.
The sir-day bicycle race is a thing- of
the past. The contest of brute physical
endurance has ended, but it has left in
its wake an atmosphere of odium, sug
gestive of trickery and crookedness, that
Is as alarming aa the exhibition was dis
gusting. Louis Gimm, one of the riders,
who for the lirst three days of the race
hid fair to defeat -Miller and capture first
money and the wreath of otoampionship,
now lies at the point of death in his apart
ments at the St. Nicholas Hotel. When
:: totally collapsed about 8 o'clock
â¢in Sunday evening he was carried to his
quarters and later taken to his rooms
in the hotel. Dr. William C. Hopper was
immediately summoned and his first ex
amination, of the rider showed that he
was in a very precarious condition. To all
â¢.ranees he was a complete physical
wreck. Yesterday morning' Dr. Hopper
called in Dr. Clark Burnham in consulta
tion. The two physicians found Gimm's
temperature at 105 decrees, while he is on
the verge of typhoid fever. At present he
is attended by two trained nurses, but the
chances for his recovery are slight. No
one is allowed to see him by the order of
Dr. Hopper.
In speaking of his condition yesterday
Dr. Hopper said Gimm was threatened
with typhoid fever as a result of the race.
He thought his system was in a predis
posed condition when he entered the con
test. In addition to this Gimm has what
id known aa the dilated heart. That is
his heart became so weakened by the de
mands made upon his constitution that it
was unable to pump the blood through
his veins properly and in consequence it
has collected in the valves of the heart.
Dr. Hopper did not hesitate to say that
Gimm's condition was precarious in the
extreme. He admitted that it was the
result of the race.
These are the facts that are generally
known to the public, but yesterday it was
rumored that Gimm had been drugged for
the purpose of clearing the road for Mil
ler, while others assert that if this was
done it was to make the place money
tuny for Aronsun. Dr. Hopper when pre
sented with this view of the case admit
ted that he was going to make an exam
ination of Gimm's condition again for the
purpose of endeavoring to ascertain this
very fact. He said that at present he
could not tell whether Gimm had been
arugged or not, as the symptoms in his
present condition would be similar to a
collapse such as he had suffered.
Very naturally, the managers of the
race, Messrs. Brady and Kennedy hoot
the idea of Gimm having been drugged
and yet Brady says that while the race
was on he discovered a suspicious man in
Gimm's tent, who said that he was a doc
tor. He had placed a cup of coffee in the
tent when discovered. Ttils! man was at
once ejected from the Pavilion by Bradv. I
Brady also declares that he told Leonard,
â¢ iimrn's trainer, that he should move
Gimm from the same tent with Miller.
Instead of doing this Aronson was tak
en Into the tent. At this time Gimm was :
far in the lead. John West, who trained
Miller, also assisted Leonard in handling
Gimm. Every one vouches for the hon
esty of West, who, they declare, is be
yond suspicion. Leonard also speaks In
high terms of West, but he admits that
; he made a mistake in having West assist
: him In handling Gimm.
It was on Wedn< sday afternoon, accord
: ing to Brady, that Gimm suddenly be
â  came deranged, and after that time he
i was never himself and gradually began to
| go to pieces. When the race began Gimm
i was in perfect physical condition, and the
only apparent trouble with which he suf
fered was a badly swollen knee, u^i to the
I time he suddenly denied to lose his rea
son. It is known that Miller was hpavily
backed in New York, while when the race
began Gimm could have been bought at
alluring odds.
Brady speaks of snmc mysterious bet
ting. He declares that he is as anxious
to get to the bottom of any dirty work,
if there was any, as any one. He also
admits that he was surprised by the man
ner in which Gimm suddenly seemed to
become deranged.
It may be possible that If Gimm was
drugged, his food was used as the means
through which to administer the poison.
This Idea is hooted by the bicycle me.i
at the Pavilion, but they admit that it
was possible. It may be that Gimm's col
lapse was due entirely to outraged nature
rebelling against its own abortion, but
this will be definitely proven by tho cx
i amination which is to br made by tlie
doctors. If they discover that the plucky
rider was drugged for th<=- br-fiefit of the
books there may be an investigation and
there may not. If it is necessary to hold
one there is little hope of anything bring
proven or of anybody being implicated.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1899.
THORPE BODE A
GRAND FINISH
ON TOPMAST
A World's Record
Was Equaled.
SATSUMA BEATEN A HEAD
BUCKWA COULD NOT STAND
THE PACE.
Reopening Day at the Oakland Track.
Three Favorites Won Purses.
Sloan Suspended for a
Ride on Abuse.
There seems to be no difficulty In equal
ing- or breaking records over the Oakland
track with its lightning fast surface. Yes
terday Topmast surprised the large crowd
which attended reopening day by reeling
off one mile and a sixteenth in I:4JR4,
equaling the American record made by
Redskin at Forsyth, Ind., with a catch
on his back. Topmast was ridden by
Charley Thorpe and carried 108 pounds.
Tea to 1 in the betting at post time, he
downed Satsuma in a furious drive. The
latter was best, but Jones displayed poor
tactics, which lost him the race. Old
Buckwa was an odds on choice for this
event, and the crowd fell hard. Pursers
circus horse stood on his hind legs while
at the post and the superstitious ones
raised the limit. He was out of it when
the stretch turn was reached.
Pavoritea divided honors with larger
priced ones in the betting, capturing
three events.
After riding his prettiest for several
moons Cash Sloan once more finds him
self in difficulty. In the fourth number
on the calendar, a six furlong recital,
Cash had the mount on Fred Foster's
corkscrew-legged horse. Abuse. So high
ly was the sprinter thought of that 1 to 4
weis considered a liberal price around post
call. Away none too well at the start,
Sloan found himself in innumerable pock
ets before a quarter had been traversed,
and when he finally extricated himself
later on was downed a head by Tammany
Hall II in 1:13V2- The judges suspended
Sloan pending an investigation of the
race.
Thorpe began proceedings by taking
down the first purse offered for a seven
furlong run, with Stromo, a 4 to 1 chance.
The Stromboli gelding made all the run
ning and won with little to spare from
Una Colorado. Ulm, the favorite, ran un
placed.
Bee Bee. from the Burns & Waterhousc
stable, was touted as a good thing for the
two year old scramble. She was played
down to favoritism and assuming first po
sition in the run home was landed win
ner by a scant margin over Tar Hill, an
outsider. Bamboulia finished third.
The mile selling run proved quite an
easy thing for Torsida. the favorite. Tak
ing the lead from Amelia Fonso when the
stretch was reached Smith's mare was
almost eased up at the wire. Amelia Fon
so disposed of Dare II for the place.
In the final six furlong sprint Wyoming,
the favorite, displayed rare form. He
walked past Eakir.s when the question
was asked, winning cleverly In 1:13%.
Mainstay closed up a deal of ground, lead
i ing Eakins out for second place.
Track Notes.
Seventeen books cut in.
Weaver & Co. disposed of the bay horse
Cabrlllo to Edward Corrlgun yesterday.
Terms private.
There â¢was much criticism over the ef
fort made at the finish by Beauchamp on
Highland Ball. When Beauchamp first
arrived here he brought along a very good
reputation, but If the gossips continue to
talk, he is in danger of losing it.
Coffey's horse Bernardillo openpd favor
ite for the last event on the card, but he
warmed up in such a peculiar manner that,
the judges ordered him scratched. While
being led from the judges' stand to the
paddock, the gelding broke away from
the attendant, making a circuit of the
track at break-neck speed. Then he
turned a somersault over the outsldo
fence opposite the furlong pole, and made
a tour of the stables. Bernardillo is
afflicted at times with so-called "blind
staggers," and in future his entry will not
be received.
The Thornton stake over four miles, will
be the feature of to-morrow's card. The
horses that will probably face the issue
are: David Tenny 115. Mistleton 10?, The
Bachelor 113 and Veloz 113. What-Er
Lou and Buckwa are possible starters. .
Joe Harvey again has possession of
Wheel of Fortune. An understanding was
reached yesterday, and- Hughey Jones,
who claimed the mare out of a selling
race at Ingleside on Saturday last, turned
her over to Harvey yesterday. She will
noi be a starter in the Thornton stake.
The vacation taken by Charley Thorpe
seems to have done him a world of good.
Th>- "old man" piloted three winners with
as much dash and vim as when a young
si.r. His ride <>n Topmast waa a neat
piece of horsemanship.
The Montana horse Tammany Hall
shows great improvement in the hands of
Billy Randall. He ran the race of his
career yesterday.

classification, also submitted interesting
reports. All of the reports proved the as
sociation to be in a flourishing condition,
financially and otherwise.
Louis Weinmann, president of the asso
ciation, addressed the members on many
interesting matters pertaining to the in
surance business. President Weinmann's
remarks were listened to with unabated
interest. He proved himself to be a very
entertaining talker.
"A spirit of unrest prevails in the un
derwriting business at the present time
and, for that matter, our business has
been invaded by an uncertain quantity
for the past year," said Mr. Weinmann.
"At no period within my knowledge has
there been such an urgent need for the
exercise of sagacity and good judgment
than at the present time. This spirit of
disquiet in nre insurance circles of this
coast has been brought about by inimi
cal legislation, demands for lower rates
and the unreasonable attitude of a cer
tain portion of the press. Through the
ignorance of a part of the press in every
thing that ptrtains to fire insurance, and
the hostilities thus occasioned, much has
been done to give the people the impres
sion that insurance companies are banded
together fo extort excessive premiums
upon small protection.
"The profit line in fire underwriting is
at the present time dangerously near the
margin, and we must educate the peo
ple, not only for the purpose of estab
lishing our business on a sound basis, but
also to make them realize that a profit
means full indemnity to the insured in
every honest loss. San Francisco ha 3
been the most profitable field of insur
ance on the Pacific Coast, chiefly owing
to the. efficiency of the Fire Department.
Their efforts and carefulness have re
duced the number of preventable fires to
a minimum."
In the afternoon the following papers
were read: "Independent Adjusters, E.
P Farnsworth; "The Tribulations of a
Local." J. A. Faymonvllle; "The .Salary
Solicitor System in San Francisco, R. C.
Medcraft; "The Rat Rub," Guy Francis;
"A Brief Analysis of the Theory of De
preciation," H. McDonald Spencer.
The association will elect officers to
serve for the ensuing year at this morn
ing's session. The annual banquet wih
be held this evening at Delmonico s.

His Knife Was Handy.
Matthew Price, a fireman, went Into a
clothing store on Market street, between
Third and Fourth, last night and pur
chased a pair of trousers. When the
clerk prepared to deliver them to him he
claimed they were n.pt the right ones.
Hot words followed and Price exhibited
a knife In a threatening manner. He
â was locked up at the Central Polloo Sta
tion and charged with assault with a
deadly weapon.
CONGREGATIONALISTS CONFER.
Ministers Listen to Interesting
Thoughts by Fellow Clergymen.
.There was a large attendance at the all
day meeting of the Congregational min
isters yesterday. Nearly every repre
sentative of that denomination in this
city and vicinity was seen at headquar
ters in the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation building.
The programme for the day was car
ried out in its entirety and was greatly
enjoyed by those present. The Rev. C.
R. Brown. D. I)., led the devotional s<-r
--vice, and at its conclusion an able paper
was read by the Rev. I'hilip OÂ«>mbe on
"The Power and Responsibility of th"
Ministry in Civic Regeneration." The p.i
per was a carefully prepared one and
was discussed at length by his brother
ministers.
A splendid repast was laid out in honor
of the day and was done justice to by the
visiting and local pastors. After lunch
Professor R. R. Lloyd reviewed Clark's
"Outlinps of Theology,*" which was fol
lowed by further discussion.
The Rev. J. \V. Phillips, the Rev. McH.
Wallace and the Rev. John P. Koyd gave
their views on "Sermon Plans." which
were discussed and freely criticized. De
votional prayer led by the Rev. W. Yf.
Bcudder closed the afternoon's interesting
meeting.
Luck Is Against Them.
Had It not been for the prompt Inter
ference of Officer CoonÂ«Â»y, F. W. Bryant,
his wife and two children. ag:ed S and 10
years respectively, would have been turn
ed out on the streets last night. The
Bryants have had a run of hard luck.
Mr. Bryant Js an honest, respectable man.
but has bein confined to his home with
illness for Â» long time and the family
in the little house at the rear of 931 Mis
sion street has suffered accordingly. The
rent is overdue and last night the land
lady, Mrs. Chevalier, started to eject
them. Officer Cooney was j'.isiriK at the
time and prevailed on Mrs. Chevalier to
allow the unfortunates to remain over
night in their home. Arrangements for
their proper care will be made to-day.

'Tlie clearings of the second half year of 1898
would have been much larger had not the

caused the cereal crop to be about one-third of
the usual amount, ami consequently the grain
farmer has received little money with which
to-pay off "old scores. >v
'The.- clearings were augmented during the

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 20.â Wheat was firm to be
gin with to-day and had several good apolo
gies to offer to shorts for being so. The world's
shipments to Europe last week amounted to
only 4,791,000 bushels, or about 2.500.000 bushels
less than Europe's estimated weekly require
ments, while the quantity on ocean passage
was reduced 350,000 bushels, against 290,000
bushels in corresponding week last year. Re
ports from Missouri and Nebraska were that
the winter plant had been seriously injured by
the recent extreme cold. May opened at 72%Â©
7Â£Vic. Liverpool reported wheat stocks in that
port 115,000 bushels larger than last Monday,
while London cable.i claimed only a small busi
ness in wheat and American flour Is a sack
lower since Friday last. This encouraged the

The official report of General Manager Rosa
of the Comstock Pumping Association Â£or the
week ending February 17 is as follows: Dur
ing the past week the pressure column of the
Rlsdon pumping plant was safely installed,
making a continuous line of 1500 feet of 12
--inch pipe. A slight delay was caused, due to
the placing of an expansion joint In the pipe
line that required special care in bracing and
staying it properly in the shaft. Slight changes
were made in the discharge pipe and a Tew
special connections had to be made at differ
ent points along the line of the column. These
are all finished and the last connections are
being made, so that the line can be tested to
morrow (February IS). For the safety of our
work we have installed an electric line from
our tank connecting with the water company's
flume to our valves in the pressure line on the
1750 level. The line can be extended when re
quired and is so arranged as to work auto
matically. In addition to this device we will
use telephone communication between our tank
and the 1750 station, so that our men in charge
of the elevator can be constantly advised of
the condition of the tank and flume by the
water company's watchman who will be on
duty. Four hundred feet of the Osbiston shaft
connection with the Sutro tunnel has been
cleaned out, making a total of !>4O feet.
M. W. Fox. president, and Joseph R. Ryan,
superintendent, of the Hale & Norcross Mining
Company Inspected the pumping plant as in
stalled and examined the Hale & Norcross
connection with the south lateral branch of the
Sutro tunnpl. with a view of making necessary
repairs to catch up such surface water as Is
now flowing into the lower level. When the re
pairs are made the water will be delivered into
the south lateral of the Sutro tunnel.
In the Sierra Nevada mine the north drift
from the main northwest drift on the 140 level
was advanced 34 feet during the past week and
is now out lrifl feet. The face is in porphyry
and clay, with seams of quartz. On the 900
level of the Union shaft workings the south
drift from the top of the raise at a point 80
feet up is out 71 feet. The face is in clay and
porphyry.
The official report from the Consolidated
California and Virginia mine states that during
the past week the pressure pipe of the Rlsdon
pumping plant wan safely installed In the C.
and C. shaft. The station on the 1400 level
was completed and a second set of chairs put
In working order for this level. The first bulk
head was drained out and Bft feet of the drift
cleaned out, retimbered and track laid, the
intention being to put the level in first-class
repair. Work has been continued on the in
stallation of the electric plant just above the
1750 level. All of the machinery Is in good
order, so that work can be started on the lower
levels as soon as they are drained.
In the Ophir mine, in the old Central tunnel
workings, the north drift toward the Mexican
mine has been extended 10 feet; total length
M feet; face in quartz assaying 80c gold and
1.7G ounces silver. The iron, copper and lead
sulphides that are again showing In the face
of the drift now carry more gold and silver
than at any time since the drift was "started.
On the Sutro tunnel level of the Opnlr the
water-wheel and blower station has been com
pleted and the machinery placed in position.
Connection will be made with the pressure pipe
Hn.l the blower started. As soon as the drift
has been cooled work will be started on the
C Â°ln ne the n Ãe'st & Belcher and Gould & Curry
mines 400 feet of the connecting drift between
the north lateral and Osbiston shaft has been
denned out and track laid, making the total
distance repaired 940 feet. At this point the
shaft was reached and the station found to bÂ©
partly caved and the shaft so tightly Packed
with timbers and debris from the surface that
It is necessary to blast the timbers before they
.â¢an be taken out. This work is now- being
done with three shifts of three men each. Re
timberinK will be started next week. There Â»â 
nulte a stream of water flowing down the shaft,
but it has not been possible to measure the
"Network has been done in the Chollar or
Potosl mines during the past week.

EFFECT OF THE
CENTRAL PACIFIC
REORGANIZATION
Entire System Will Be
Renovated.
MONEY FOR IMPROVEMENTS
HTJNTINGTON WIRES CONGRAT
ULATIONS TO REQUA.
Latter Says New Rolling Stock Has
Been Ordered and the Entire
Southern Pacific System
Will Be Benefited.
Following the settlement of the debt
of the Central Pacific Railroad Company
to the United States is to come an era
:of renewed activity and improvements
! on that line and also on other properties
of the Southern Pacific Company. Many
improvements contemplated of late years
have been held in abeyance awaiting the i
(iisposal of this great financial problem, j
' which has been considered one of the
i most difficult In the history of the road
: and in the career of Coliis P. Hunting
ton.
Owing to the cloud which this incubus
of nearly sixty million dollars of debt cast
on the credit of the Southern Pacific
Company, it was found impracticable for
i that corporation to go into the money
markets of the world to raise funds for
much-needed improvements. This ob
| stacle has been removed by the settle
ment announced last week, and a scheme
! of financiering is now in contemplation,
' which will not only provide ample mtans
1 for liquidating the entire funded and fluitt
ing indebtedness of the Central Pacific,
i bui will leave an ample surplus tor im
provements to the roadbed, additions to
I the rolling stock and even for extensions
i of the line.
I That President Huntlngton of the
i Southern Pacific Company is extremely
' gratified over the outcome of his long
' pending controversy with the Government
, is shown by a telegram received yesterday
i from New York by President Isaac JL.
Requa of the Central Pacific Railroad,
; signed by C. P. Huniington, which read
as follows:
"1 congratulate you and the majority
of the board of directors on the consum
mation of the result we have so long
hoped and worked for, namely, the settle
ment or the Central Pacific Railroad
("ompaily'B debt to the Government. My
associates and myself want you to under
stand that we appreciate all that you and
! they have done toward this result, and
! are glad to give you all the credit you
deserve for your assistance in behalf of
the stockholders. 1 am confident that
the future will show that those who have
stood by each other in defense of the
best interests of the Central Pacific Rail
road Company and its shareholders build
ed better than they knew."
President Requa was no less pleased
over the outcome, and said he believed
the result of the settlement would soon
be visible in the improvements that
would be inaugurated and in those under
way that would now be rushed to com
pletion. Referring to the closing of the
gap on the coast division between Surf
and Elwood he said:
"The company is now very well pre
pared for that work. It has been busy
during the past year straightening out
the crooks and grades on that line, and
â¢will now have sufficient money at its com
mand to connect the two ends of the line.
The work of doing so will no doubt, be
immediately begun. I calculate it will
take about twelve months to have it in
shape A great deal of work has already
been done on the main line as far as Sa
linas in the way of putting tne line into
condition for attaining a greater rate of
speed with safety.
"ThÂ« question of the Central Pacific s
debt to the Government," he continued,
i "is now out of the way. for good. You
will hear no more talk about the Central
Pacific Railroad being owned by the Gov
ernment. Under the terms of the settle
ment we shall pay the Government $15,
--1 000 000 on the 7th of July. After that they
will get about $3,000,000 every six months
' until the balance is paid. The notes to
1 the Government bear interest at 3 per
cent and are twenty in number, the total
amount of the debt being something over
$55,000,000.
"In order to raise the money to meet
these notes the entire Central Pacific sys
tem comprising about fourteen hundred
mile's ol railroad, will be bonded for $100,
--000 000 the bonds to bear 4 per cent. The
Government aided line only takes in
about 800 miles. Before these new bonds
i ure issued all the 5 per cent bonds in the
! hands of the holder? of the first mort
gage bonds will be called in and replaced
on satisfactory terms with the new bonds.
This will be taken up at the annual meet
ing of the stockholders, which will be
held in San Francisco in April.
"I look forward to a very active and
profitable business awakening on this
coast fr'ta one end to the other. In anti
cipation of what has come to pass the

PACIFIC ROADS OBLIGATIONS.
Governent Fares Well in Securing a
Settlement of Its Claims.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â A siateim-nt
concerning the settlement of the Pacific
railroad obligations way made to-day by
the Department of Justice from which
the following is an extract:
"It will be remembered that by the bill
authorizing the construction of the Pacific
railroads, passed in 18(52, the United States
agreed to lend its credit to the various
Pacific railroad companies for the pur
pose of aiding them in the construction of
a line of railway from the Missouri River
to the Pacific Ocean. For that purpose
bonds were issued in aid of the Union
Pacific Railroad to the amount of $27,
--236,512; to what was subsequently known
as the Kansas Pacific to the amount of
$6,303,000; to the Central Pacific to the
amount of $25,885,120; and to the Western
Pacific to the amount of $1,970,560.
"Upon these bonds without direct re
imbursement the United States paid in
terest from the date of their respective
issues, so that in IRO7 there was due to the
United States from the Union Pacific
Railroad Company the sum of $58,488,223;
from the Kansas Pacific in round num
bers the sum of $13,000,000. On the Ist of
February, 1899. there was due from the
Central Pacific Railroad Company the
sum of $53,389,062, and there was due from
the Western Pacific on the same date the
sum of $5,423,6Â«52.
"The vast accumulation of principal
and interest due to the United States
from these companies has heretofore
given great concern to the Government,
it having been the common Impression
that the United States would never re
ceive anything like the full amount of its
investment by way of return. Various
propositions have been advanced from the
most conservative financiers for the ad
justment of these claims, ranging all the
way from propositions to settle for 50
cents on the dollar to refunding measures
which were intended to extend the pay
ment for 100 years.
"The agreement just made with the
Central Pacific Railroad Company as
sures beyond the slightest doubt the full
payment of the debt of the Central Pa
cific and the Western Pacific railroads,
aggregating $58,812,715 48. This debt by
the agreement is funded for payment
within the period of ten years; one-twen
tieth thereof being payable each six
months during that period, and the Gov
ernment receiving 3 per cent interest
upon thÂ» balance remaining due from
time to time. The treasury will imme
diately receive about $12,000,000 by the sal.?
of the first four notes maturing under this
agreement, which are taken by Speyer &
Co. as an earnest of good faith and as a
reliance which they place upon the abil
ity of the contracting parties to meet the
obligation entered into by the agreement.
"Thf total result of all these transac
tions is that out of these claims which it
was once supposed would not realise the
Government 50 cents on the dollar the
United States will receive the enormous
sum of $123,563,93!) 2.:â enough to pay more
than six tlm<-< over the amount due to
Sn.'in under the treaty of Paris for the
Philippines." 1
"SIGH OF THE

Mask.

Thrift is the watchword in modern
theatricals. Thrift is a power against
which even the most sacred traditions
and superstitions are not invincible.
Out at the Chutes the Passion Play is
presented by a projecting machine, to
say nothing of an amateur ballet and
a dwarfed paralytic in the life. I have
dropped a nickel in the slot and heard
what were alleged to be the maniacal
ravings of John McCollough. At the
Columbia Theater last night I saw a
so-called religious drama, written by
Wilson Barrett, and entitled "The Sign
of the Cross."
If ever theatrical man had thrift Mr.
Barrett has itâ and audacity, too. Ho
has rushed in where angels would have
feared to tread, and prospered opulent
ly. Himself a man of few talents, he
has yet been clever enough to trade
on the weaknesses of others. "The
Sign of the Cross" has made him rich.
It is a goose-flesh drama to frighten
women and children, to pander with
hypocritical pruriency to the baser in
stincts of men, to seduce simple-mind
ed ministers of the gospel into writing
tearful testimonials, thereby advertis
ing the play, and, more than incident
ally, themselves. Mr. Barrett is su
premely thrifty, and I have no doubt
that his representatives will do a rous
ing business on Powell street at the
sign of the cross. The cross was our
in bold relief last night on Powell
street. It was hung high and flaring
and made of crimson incandescents.
and a big crowd passed under it and
into the Columbia Theater to do lust
what Mr. Barrett expected them to 3u.
Preachers, I was told, were there by
the dozen, and Mr. Greenway and other
worldly gentlemen sat expectantly In
the front row. Women wept, a child
or two cried, men and ushers applaud
ed; the curtain was run up again and
again after each act. In the parlance
of Mr. Barrett's profession, the play
was a hit. A vulgar, immoderate play,
that to the seriously holy ridicules all
that is holy, that brutalizes one of the
most thrilling of all religious legends,
that makes a vaudeville act of physical
torture and a showman's virtue of a
scene in which a girl is almost openly
ravished by a wine and passion-drunk
manâ and the play is a hit.' We San
Franciscans are prone to sneer at the
theatrical tastes of New York. I have
done some sneering In that direction
on my own account. But be it everlast

ingly written to the credit of gay New-
York that she refused to accept this
Neronian nightmare Which Mr. Wilson
Barrett is pleased to call "The Sign of
the Cross." And unless I am greatly in
error the horrible torture scene which
we were treated to last night was omit
ted in the New York production. In
this scene a boy, or, to be accurate, a
woman clad as a, boy, is flogged until
she falls shrieking to the floor and then
taken to another apartment, from
which are heard the straining of the
rack and the ululations of the victim.
The assault scene I refuse to adver
tise by describing. It sickened me, and
my stomach is not unaccustomed to
hard knocks. Let the Orpheum dis
close an act like this one and the po
lice would raid the place. Mr. Barrett,
like Mr. Hall Came and other thrifty
sensationalists who have profited by
the indorsement of a sensational clergy,
garbs his fleshliness in the spacious
overcoat of "religion." Marcus Super
bus, Prefect of Rome, desires the body
of the Christian girl Merciaâ and this
is given you not in narrative, not in
insinuation, but in brutal action. Fail
ing in all other things, Marcus Super
bus finally gets religion, and together
they enter the arena to die with the
rest of Nero's Christian victims. That's
where the morals come in. Morals for
sooth.
So far as the actors and scenic equip
ment go liberal praise is due. Charles
Dalton, who plays the Prefect, is a
heroic actor of magnetism and art: Miss
Agnes Scott is an admirable study in
the part of Berenis, the jealous pa
trician; and iiiss Irene Rooke is pa
thetically adequate to the heroine. In
deed there are many clever players in
this English company, and the pictorial
and actorial arrangement of the stage
is excellent. But the play is profane,
inartistic, brutal and illiterateâ a dank,
depressing melodrama. If any of the ]
gentlemen of the cloth intend writing
or preaching about it I hope they will
not overlook the Passion Play and the
paralyzed party and the amateur ballet
out at the Chutes. ââââ

California.
Black Patti's Troubadours entered the
second week of their engagement last
night to a good house.
Treasurer Louis A. Morgenstern of the
California Theater is to be tendered a
grand complimentary benefit at that
houae on Friday evening, when the Black
Pattl Troubadours will give some special
features. The popular treasurer will
have a rousing benefit.
Nance O'Neil Is to come back for eight
performances, beginning next Monday
night. A petition has been signed by
many of the leading people of the State
requesting a return engagement prior to
her departure for London, and in conse
quence a week has b<^en securt-d at the i
California Theater. The opening play is
to be "Magda." which will be repeated
on Thursday night. On Tuesday evening
Mi?e O'Neil will appear for the first time
here in the new "East Lynne." Other
plays for the week are "Ineomar. "I he
Jewess, " "Oliver Twist" and â¢â¢Camille.
Alcazar.
The stock company at the Alcazar j
scored a genuine success last night in ;
Belasco and Fyles' military drama, "The
Girl 1 Left Behind Me." The theater was j
crowded and the audience enthusiastic.
At the close of the third act. when the re
lief of the apparently doomed men and
women at Post Kennion is accomplished, j
the audience went wild and the curtain j
had to be raised six times. Ernest i
Hastings as Lieutenant Edgar llawkes- :
worth was manly and impressive and I
made the hit of the evening. Clarence j
Montalne as Major Burleigh and Master
Jimmy Horn as his son Dick were excel- I
lent, and George Osbourno as General \
Kennion and George Webster as Lieu- ,
tenant Morton Parlow, the villian were
praiseworthy. Misa Adelaide Fitzallen :
as Kato Kennion and Miss Juliet Crosby
as Lucky Hawkesworth were charming
and Miss Laura Crews, a product of the
Northwest, was ingenuous. The other
parts were well played.
Orpheum.
The most artistic of the new acts at
the Orpheum this week is contributed by
J. K. Murray and Clara Lane, who ap
pear in costume and sing several selec
tions from the light operas that have
been, threaded around a sufficient little
plot. Miss Lane has an agile and sym
pathetic soprano and Mr. Murray a bary
tone of charming quality. Their ringing
iÃ refreshingly legitimate; in fact, the en
tire act is a graceful addition to vaude
ville. A quite different turn of a noisy,
rough-and-tumble nature is furnished by
Lew Bloom i.nd Jane Cooper, under the !
title of "A Picture From Life. " Mr.
Bloom is an inebriated tramp and Miss
Cooper is first a loud-voiced city girl and
later a village spinster. In lines, action
and performance the skit is incline! to
roughness, but there is enough fun in it
to make people laugh in spit** of their
better naturesâ indeed, the audience at
the opening performance could not get
enough of it. Mips Edith Crask, a heavy
weight but nimble premiere danseuse,
does a number of national dances in coh
tume and adds to the gayety of the crowd
by announcing them in voice and accent
that hardly belong to this world.
Of the hold-over turns the best are Car
ter de Haven and Bonnie Male, juvenile
cake-walkers: Shortis and his fretless
banjo, and the dog and monkey troupe.
Conroy and McDonald and Lang and
Keeler have changed their acts, but they
are still something less than the Orpheum
standard.
Tivoli.
B'ne B'rith held carnival in the Tivoli
last night, where "Madeleine, or the Magic
Kiss," was presented to a crowded house.
The opera is one of many charms. It is
given a strong production and will run
until further notice.
Olympia.
The new feature of the bill at the
Olympia this week is Sherman and Mor
risey, acrobats and comedians. They
scored a great hit in their comedy work.
Querita Vincent was welcomed back and
seems to be more popular than ever. The
one Lynwood is still a card. The bill has
some ten or more other good acts.
Chutes.
Violet Dale sang badly, bucked and
winged cleverly and finally summer
saulted herself into two encores at the
Chutes Free Theater last evening. She
is the best acrobatic dancer in
San Francisco. Jack Symonds mono
logued for half an hour and kept the
large audience roaring. He is genuinely
funuy. The Morrelle nanjoed. told stories
and made a hit. The three De Bolien
brothers repeated tjheir acrobatic success
of last week and Pianka continued to feed
her lions strips of raw meat from her lips.
The Passion Play was appreciated. To^
morrow afternoon. Washington's birth
day. Emil Markeberg will make a balloon
ascension, and on Thursday night the am
ateur ballet will be repeated.
Central Park.
The "gravity horses" at the Steeple
chase at Central Park have caught the
popular fancy and thousands of persons
of all ages are enjoying the sport. The
Buccess of the Steeplechase in the East
and in Europe seems destined to be dupli
cated on this coast.

ADMIRAL SCHLEY
ANSWERS CHARGES
Not Guilty of "Repre
v- hensible Conduct."
ORDERS PROMPTLY OBEYED
WHY HE DELAYED PROCEEDING
.;. :. TO SANTIAGO.
Draws a Contrast Between the Be- â 
ports of Sampson and Himself
â¢" . After the Destruction of
:â ' Cervera's Fleet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â Rear Admiral j
. W. S. Schley, having been granted per- j
. mission to answer the charges recently j
"â¢.made against him In a communication .
.'.sent to the Senate, to-day handed to the
Committee on Naval Affairs his state
â  ment. In which he disclaims any purpose
of controversy with the Navy Depart
ment. The letter of the department, he
â  Bays, so far as it relates to him, can be ;
'summarized under the following heads:
"The delay off Cienfuegos; that alleged
plow progress toward Santiago de Cuba
from Cienfuegos; the retrogade move
ments of the 26th and 2Ttli of May; the
battle of Santiago and the destruction of
- Cervei fleet."
The admiral says his orders from
Sampson on May 19 were to blockade
Cienfvfegos. which he proceeded to do. He
had no knowledge that there were any
insurgents about Cienfuegos who were
friendly until the Marblehead arrived on
the -24th. Then he sent Commander Mc-
Calla of the Marblehead ashore to estab
lish relations with the insurgents, the re-
BUlt or which was made known to him at j
3:40 p. m. on May 24. Then, for the first
time, he learned definitely that the Span
' ish fleet was not at Cienfuegos. Within;
two hours be started for Santiago. >% ;
"What possible ground for criticism, i
he says, "adverse to me there can be in
all this I do not see. 1 was on the spot. ;
. acting under orders which cave me en- I
tire discretion, and yet clothed me with
the responsibility of going to Santiago
only after 1 was satisfied that the fleet
was not at Cienfuegos."
lie quotes from the dispatches of
' Sampson of May 20, in which the latter j
said Schley should "hold his fleet off
fuegos. If the Spanish ships have
: put into Santigao they must come either
-. to Havana or to Cienfuegos to deliver
the munitions which they are said to
â¢ bring for use in Cuba.
â¢ â¢I am therefore of the opinion that the I
best chance to capture these ships will!
be to hold the two points, Cienfuegos and
Havana, with all the force we can mus
ter. If later it should develop that these
' vessels are at Santiago we can then as- j
semble off that port the snips best Suited ;
for the purpose and completely blockade I
it. Until we then receive more positive
information we shall continue to hold Ha
â  vana and Cienfuegos."
Admiral Schley .-aid: "This letter is not
printed either in the appendix or execu- i
tive' document C. but 1 received it on the
; 23d. and it shows that I was expected to
hold my squadron off Cienfuegos." ;
As to the slow progress toward San
tiago on account of the Eagle, he states
â . that she was a part of the force which
Admiral Sampson had seen fit to send
him. and he had no right to abandon
her. The weather also was rough and not
much better speed could have been kept
up. He had been ordered to proceed
:"â¢ "cautiously." If, however, he had known
that the Spanish Heel was in Santiago
â¢ â no consideration of the Eagle or any one
â¢ efse would have prevented him from get
. ting there at the earliest possible mo
.:ment with the larger vessels, but the
â¢â weather and sea made it Impossible to do
â¢better than he did. Speaking of the. "re
' trograde movements'.' which the Secre
tary, adapting the language of Admiral
'Sampson, characterizes as "reprehensible
.'.conduct," Admiral Schley says that in
"forty-two years' service "never was such :
language used to characterize conduct of
mine, and 1 see no reason for it now."
"â 'He adds: "Acting in accordance with
''my. best judgment, in view of the circum- '
stances, without certain knowledge of the
'â¢â¢â whereabouts of the Spanish fleet, after
Haying been informed by the scouts com
manded by. such officers as Sigsbee,
-..Jewell and Wise, that although they had
" been off Santiago for a week they had
; seen nothing of it and knew nothing of
. Its' movements or Its whereabouts since it
- had left Curacoa, after having been as
- sured by Sigsbee that he did not believe
. It was in Santiago and by the emphatic
declaration of the pilot", Nunez; and
knowing that a* the sea and weather
then were it would be impossible to coal
my squadron off the port. 1 deemed It
beet to take the action I did, the final re
sult of which was the location of the en
emy's fleet in Santiago harbor."
: - As" to the battle of Santiago Admiral
.Schley says the facts of that contest
. speak for themselves. He quotes from
his official report to Sampson in which he
congratulated the commander of the
. squadron and said the "victory seems big
enough for all of us." He asks the com
. mittee to contrast his reports and those
.'of Sampson containing references to him
self and continues: "As to all this criti
cism of my course prior to the discovery !
. of -Cervera's fleet with that of Admiral j
. Sampson or the department, none of it
â¢ has ever been made by either of them to
me; I never heard a word of it from any
one. until after the battle with that fleet, I
although more than live weeks had passed
since the alleged 'reprehensible conduct'
had occurred. Although Admiral Samp
. son used this langauge to the Secretary
concerning me on the 10th day of July
- (just one week after the battle) he has
.'never, to this day. in any manner or to
' any extent intimated to me any disappro
. bation- or made to me any criticism of
roy conduct of the flying squadron."
Admiral Schley then submits a long de
tailed statement of the facts he summar
ized in the foregoing, which is in reply to
a request by Chairman Hale of the Naval
. .Committee. It gives the dispatches and
. "orders received by Schley and describes
.the condition in which the ships had to
coal, as well as the sailing for Santiago.
â¢ He also refers to the doubts that arose
â¢ as to the presence of the Spanish fleet
tn Santiago after he had arrived off that
"â¢ port. Captain Slgsbet- stated verbally
..that he had been close in to port several
' times and there were no indications that
â¢ the enemy was present and he doubted
its arrival there.
. - The commanding officer of the Harvard
, reported that he did not have coal enough
â¢ to reach a home base and could not steam
. beyond twenty-four or thirty hours
â which the admiral says forced him to
send the Harvard to Kingston. The Yale
â¢ -pnA Minneapolis could reach Key West
â¢ and the St. Paul could remain at most of
the ports but for two days. The Brook
lyn, lowa and Massachusetts were fairly
. -well off with coal, but the Texas. Marble-
V head and Vixen were considerably reduc
ed. The projecting sponsons of the Texas
and Marblehead made it dangerous to
â¢ coal them alongside the collier with any
swell on the open sea.
"It was this situation," says the state
ment, "coupled with the conclusion that
the Spanish squadron might have touched
Â» and then moved west as reported at Cien
,. fvipgos. and, reinforced by the fact that
Sigsbee had not seen them, and that the
, pilot Nunez was strongly impressed with
.the. doubt that this squadron could enter
the port, which occasioned my telegram
â¢ â of May 27."
*â¢ He then states that the chief engineers
â â¢'of the collier, after much hard work, dis
connected the broken engines, while being
. taken in tow and the weather and sea
moderating, orders were given to cast off
c the tow line after about three hours'
steaming west. Captain Sigsbee is quoted
as' confirming the opinion as to the dif
ficulty of coaling off Santiago. He gives
the details of the absolute location of the
.Spanish squadron inside the harbor on
May 29. which discovery .was. the admiral
' Bays, the result of a determination to sat
isfy himself fully before leaving for the
â¢west. On the 31st he made a reconnols
t=ancc, "to develop the enemy's position
and incidentally to Injure or destroy if
possible the Colon, moored well up in the
harbor. The question of the presence of
the enemy determined, he decided not to
risk serious disablement until re-en
forcements arrived.
Admiral Schley quotes the department
â¢â¢ dispatch of May 29 in these words: "The
department looks to you to ascertain the
â¢ fact of the presence of the enemy and to
Bee that the enemy, If in the harbor or
Santiago, does not leave without decisive
action " Commenting on this the admiral
says: "In obedience to the above order,
and without any further order or inÂ»truc-
Uon from any one. 1 did ascertain the fart
that the enemy was at San t ago and the
enemy did not leave without a decisne
conflict." __________ â
REPRESENTATIVE LAW
GIVES HIS TESTIMONY
SALT LAKE, Feb. 20.â Representative j
Law. who charged that he had been offer
' ed money to vote for McCune for Senator,
was before the legislative investigation
committee for two hours to-day. Hia
testimony was substantially the same as
; outlined in his speech on Saturday, but
i more in detail. At the conclusion of the
direct examination the witness was sub
jected to a long cross-examination by
1 Judge Dixon, one of the attorneys for
I McCune. The cross-examination did not
i develop any material facts not covered
â  in the original charge.
Before beginning the proceedings to-day
considerable preliminary sparring oc
i curred.,Mr. Evans, the attorney for Rep
resentative Law. contending for further
time in which to prepare charges, and
the attorneys for McCune urging an im
mediate investigation. It was finally
: agreed to proceed on the charges already
specified, and Attorney Evans was given
a certain time in which to tell who the
I "divers other" legislators were who are
alleged to have been offered bribes by
McCune.
To-night Representative Law filed addi
tional charges of bribery. He makes the
! charge that R. W. Sloan, acting for Me-
Cune, tried to induce W. G. Nebeeker to
| assist in the election of McCune to the
i United States Senate, and said to said
( Nebecker that money was being used
' therefor and that he wanted to see his
: 'Sloan's) friends gpt some of it; that

pression of Fisher S. Harris, manager for
McCune. had said to Ivins that "Jack
i son's vote must be obtained, no matter
; at what the expense": also that Repre
sentative Farr had said to Representative
' Cook In substance that if he (Cook), with
the two Nebeckers and one other man
would vote for McCune. they could get
$20,000 or $25,000 for so doing.

SEATTLE, Feb. 20.â After a trial last
ing two weeks, Judge Moore of the Su
perior Court to-day decided the sensa
tional Van Alstine. divorce case, annulling
the marriage and ordering the wife to
pay into court $31,000. alleged to have been
stolen from her husband. Klondiker Con
Van Alstine, at Salt Lake last summer.
Mrs. Lou Van Alstine, her sister, Emma
Norton; O. B. Noyes and M. G. Win

disreputable resort on Keamy street in
San Francisco in 1596 and 1897. In De
cember. 1597. the Mahaffey woman met
Van Alstine. an illiterate miner, on a â 
steamer returning from Alaska. She mar
ried him on Jajiuary 5. 1898. Noyes active
ly aided her and Winstock also was
drawn Into the affair.
After the marriage Van Alstine re
turned to the Klondike and sold his claim
for $40,000. Returning, he and his wife
went Bast on a bridal tour from San
Francisco last August. She got $36,000 in
a certificate of deposit away from him by
some pretext and in New York deserted
him and sailed for Europe. Van Alstine
pursued her and brought her back. They
returned to Seattle and she brought the
divorce suit. She claimed in the trial that
the money was returned to Van Alstine
in September in New York. The court.
decides, however, that the certificates
were cashed by the Norton wonian in Se
attle, and that the money is still in pos
session of the woman.

Judge Harvey Brown Admits Having Aided
in Securing the Decree, but Doubts the
Reconciliation of the Pairâ Two
Interesting Letters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Feb. 20.
IT has been reserved for Oakland to
have the honor of divorcing a man
and woman desperately in love with
each other, living with each other un
der the same roof at this time, and who
claim to have been separated through a
conspiracy formed by some of the most
prominent residents of this ciiy.
The story of the many sensational inci
dents surrounding the divorce case of
Yates vs. Yates, in which the plaintiff
was the well-known spiritualist and lec
turer, Madame Montague Yates, have al
ready been exclusively published in this
paper. After the secret recording of a
decree separating the madame and her
husband on the 21st of last December, it
was thought that the incident was closed,
that the parties were separated in fact as
well a3 in law, and that the conspiracy
was a perfect success.
Now come letters from Madame Monta
gue and her husband, which impugn the
integrity of prominent Oaklanders and at
tack the legality of the decree. In the
Judgment book in the County Clerk's of
fice appears a judgment in favor of Alice
Yates, which sets forth that for four
years last past the madame has been a
bona fide resident of Oakland. It asserts
that for two years before the action was
commenced. September. 1895, the defend

PLEASURE PARTY
ROLLS OVER AN
EMBANKMENT
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Feb. 20.
A pleasure party comprising twelve per- 1
sons came to grief near San Ramon yes- |
terday and narrowly escaped an untimely
death by the overturning of a stage on
the main road between Haywards and San j
j Ramon. The road leads over some long j
! inclines and very near some dangerous
j embankments.
, About a mile from San Ramon one of j
! the horses fell and the stage poie broke. j
| While the vehicle came to a standstill, the |
j horses were yet in commotion, and aud- i
' denly the nervous animals started up |
again, pulling the vehicle upon the fallen
horse, overturning it toward the side of
the narrow road and finally causing the
wagon and Its occupants to roll down an
embankment to a distance of over thirty I
cree was granted, which bears out pre
cisely what I have said."
The three parties to whom Mme. Mon
tague refers are said to be Judge Harvey
Brown, Dr. Stratton and one other mem
ber of the Psychic Society, supposed to be
a woman. Mr. Stratton at the time of the
divorce suit did everything possible to
prevent publicity on behalf of Mrs. Yates.
He declared that notoriety would certain
ly hasten her end, either by death or sui
cide, and yet the story was published and
has been followed by a more sensational
chapter than apparently Mr. Stratton ever
dreamed of.
Judge Harvey Brown was the president
of the Oakland Psychic Society, which ex
isted just as long as Mme. Montague lec
tured. Since her departure it has col
lapsed. The Judge was the only witness
besides Mme. Montague before the Court
Commissioner, giving the evidence upon
which the decree was based. His testi
mony did not go to the main issue in
the case, but was confined entirely to
facts proving that Mme. Montague was a
worthy woman of good reputation and
Inflexible Integrity.
Mrs. Montague's letter was shown to
Judge Harvey Brown at his home, 1099
Adeline street, to-night, and after a care
ful perusal he expressed very great sur
prise over its contents. In fact, he ap
peared to be but little less than dum
founded. He was loth to give any opin
ion in the matter or be interviewed un
til pressed. Finally, however, he said:
"I have no faith in the authenticity of
that letter. I do not believe that It was
written by Mrs. Montague. If that letter
is authentic, then Mrs. Montague is men
tally unbalanced, or she has developed
into' a purveyor of fairy tales. As to the
statement made in Montague Yates' let
ter to the effect that any action or step
which his wife may have taken toward a
separation being solely due to the pres
sure of members of the Psychic Society,
of which I am president, that is abso
lutely false and without foundation.
"Six: years ago Mrs. Montague was de
serted by her husband. One day she came
to me and requested that I, acting as
her attorney, commence divorce proceed
ings for her. I declined, telling her \
could not do so. because I was a friend of
her husband. Later she came again and
in the presence of Mrs. Price, her attend
ant, stated that she did not know what
to do; that she feared, unless her hus
bii.'id was sent away, he would surely kill
her.
"Well, we put our hands down in our
pockets and put up the money to send the
husband on a trip to England. It was our
Intention to file the divorce suit during
his absence. Afterward Mrs. Montague
was also to leave on a protracted trip, her
testimony being first taken, and during
her absence the decree of divorce was to
be secured.
"Now, that is all there is to the whole
matter. The decree has been granted,
and they are divorced, and I do not be
lieve that Mr. and Mrs. Montague are
now living together, nor that she ever
wrote that letter. Again I say that if
that letter is authentic Mrs. Montague is
surely flighty or has made statements
that are absolutely incorrect."
The letter? bear the Montreal postmark
and a comparison with others would in
divate that they are certainly genuine.
feet below, completely wrecking the
stage.
Fortunately, all escaped with their lives
and but four of the party of pleasure
seekers sustained injuries. These were.
Lawrence Ainsworth, son of Captain
George C. Ainsworth of Portland, Ore.,
whose right arm was fractured: Coke
Hill of San P'ranciseo, whose wrist was
badly sprained; Mrs. George Ainsworth of
Portland, right shoulder bruised, and
Miss Mabel Ainsworth, badly scratched
and bruised.
The others who were in the wreck were
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sutton of Haywards:
Herbert and John Sutton, Miss Downey
of Berkeley, Miss Ethel Whitney and
Miss Georgie Strong, of Oakland.
Several of the uninjured men hastened
to San Ramon and from there telephoned
to Gray Brothers, owners of the vehicle,
ordering a conveyance to bring the ex
cursionists back to the Sutton residence
at Haywards. Several hours elapsed be
fore the party could reach the Sutton
residence, where Dr. Dean reduced Mrs.
Ainsworth'6 fracture and attended to tho
injuries of the others.

suicide is considered by the authorities
as probable, although hip friends and rela
tives scorn the idea that he deliberately
ended hie life.
His dead body was found yesterday
' follows: "Provided, That on or before
i the 20th day of June of any year the
Board of School Trustees, or City Board
of Education, shall meet and by ballot
! elect teachers for the ensuing year."
The other feature against which influ
; ence will be brought is a clause providing
: that holders of elementary or primary
(â 'â rtlficatos shall not be permitted to
; teach in California.
The first clause is calculated to destroy
! the life tenure of teachers in this city,
and the last would deprive the State of
many useful teachers.
Superintendent of Schools Webster pre
' sided and Colonel C. H. Murphy, who In
! company with W. D. Kingsbury went to
i Sacramento to protect the interests of the
; teachers, first outlined the bills which
! were the subject of contention, and spoke
I briefly upon the efforts of the committee
to promote wise measures and kill dan
gerous ones. He introduced a resolution
which expressed the sentiment of the
meeting as being opposed to the particu
lar bills which contain these clauses.
Colonel Murphy, \V. D. Kingsbury and
President Bergerot were appointed a com
mittee to take charge of the fight and in
structed to proceed at once to Sacra

features of bills now before the Legisla

DEADLY CARBOLIC ACID.
Mrs. G. J. McKnight While Tempo
rarily Insane Commits Suicide.
Mrs. George J. McKnight, wife of a
painter living at 73 Clementina street,
swallowed a dose of carbolic acid yester
day mnrning and died at the Receiving
Hospital a few minutes later. Her body
was removed to the Morgue.
Mrs. j^fcKnight had been acting queerly
for three or four days, and yesterday
morning went to Bryan & Co.'s drug
store, Second and Howard streets, and
purchased a three-ounce bottle of car
bolic acid. She went directly home and
swallowed the contents. Her daughter
was In an adjoining room, and hearing
her mother scream, rushed in and saw
bar on the floor groaning with pain. The
patrol wagon was summoned and she was
hurried to thn hospital.
The woman left three children, two
boys, one 19 yaarÃ of age and the other
15, and a girl 14 years of age. The family
was in comfortable circumstances, and
there was no reason why Mrs. McKnight
should end her Hfe. so her family say.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1899.
morning by Mrs. Sarah Shoots, the land
lady of the house in which he lived
for the past fifteen years. As
was her usual custom, she knock
ed at his room door at 7 o'clock,
but, receiving no response, ?he concluded
to postpone calling Mr. Hyman until 9
o'clock, thinking at the time that he was
fatigued. She again called him at 9
o'clock, but met with the same result. She
immediately came to the conclusion that
Hyman was either too sick to answe? or
that he had been stricken with apoplexy.
She obtained a duplicate key to the room
and succeeded in effecting an entrance.
As she opened the door she was almost
overcome by escaping gas. She immedi
ately ran to the street, where she attract
ed the attention of Dr. Van Meter, who
was passing the premises at the time.
Upon investigation the body of Hyman
was prononuced dead by the doctor, who
immediately notified the Coroner.
"When the deputies from the Morgue ar
rived they found that the chandelier In
the middle of the rcom had been entirely
removed. The doors and transom were
tightly closed, indicating that death was
deliberate and not accidental.
Although the relatives of the deceased
merchant maintain that the chandelier
fpll and was not removed the fact re
mains that if it fell the globes on it would
have been broken and the connecting joint
shattered. On the contrary, they were in
a perfect state when found, one of the
globes having apparently been taken off
the chandelier and placed under the bed
before the latter was removed.
When found the body was lying at the
foot of the bed with 'the head reclining
on a small table beside it.
Mrs. Shoots, the landlady, says that
when she met Hyman, about 10 o'clock
the night before, he was in the best of
health and spirits. She, however, ad
mitted that he was slightly excited, but
not enough so to deprive himself of rea
son or induce him to commit the rash
act that ended in death. She said that he
frequently complained of illness, but
never said that he was a subject for
apoplexy.
He was seen the samp night by a Mrs.
Hoffman about 9:30 o'clock, at the bicycle
race at the Pavilion. He talked pleasant
ly at the time, showing absolutely not the
slighest indication that he was suffering.
The relatives of the dead man explain
his death as one of accident and not de
liberation. They maintain that he was
stricken with apoplexy four weeks ago
and was at the time conveyed to the Gei
man Hospital, where he remained for
over a week. Another stroke of the
disease visited him last Friday night and
they now claim in point of this fact that
while suffering under this last stroke
he accidentally knocked the chandelier
from its fastening while endeavoring to
gain his bed.
The body, by the request of relatives
of the deceased, was taken to an under
taking establishment, instead of being
conveyed to the Morgue.
Mr. 'Hyman was about 53 years of age
and was for years connected with the
firm of M. Hyman. Upon the death of the
latter he established the firm of Stiner,
Strauss & Hyman. The firm now occupies
the premises at 108-110 Sansome street.
The deceased leaves a daughter 15 years
of age.
An inquest on the body will probably be
held some time to-day. The interment of
the body will be under the direction of the
rabbi of the Temple Emanu-El.

MRS. BERTSCH
IS ROBBED OF
COSTLY JEWELS
A Bold Thief Makes a
Rich Haul.
GEMS VALUED AT $2500
DARING DAYLIGHT BURGLARY
AT THE BELLA VISTA.
Apartment of an Army Officer's Wife
Enteredâ Sixty-five Dollars in
Money Also Taken â Police
Have No Clew.
i
A daring burglar entered the apart
ments of Mrs. Lieutenant W. H. Bertsch
at the Bella Vista Hotel last Thursday
afternoon and succeeded in making 1 one
of the richest hauls that has been
brought to the notice of the police during
the past year. The thief got away with
two thousand five hundred dollars' worth
of diamonds and jewelry and sixty-five
dollars in cash. The bold robbery has
created consternation among the guests
of the hotel, as they fear that their apart
ments may be looted at any moment.
Mrs. Bertsch, who is the young and
handsome wife of Lieutenant Bertsch of
the Fifteenth Regular Infantry, now sta
tioned In Cuba, has only been a guest at
the hotel for about a month. Her beau
tifully furnished apartments are on the
third floor close to the elevator. About
noon last Thursday Mrs. Bertsch left the
hotel to go downtown on business. She
locked the door of her apartments before
leaving and hung the key on a hook in
th^ elevator, quite a general custom of
the guests at the hotel. When she re
turned home at 4 o'clock Mrs. Bertsch
had occasion to open the top drawer of
her escritoire, and to her amazement she
discovered that in her absence a burglar
had entered the room and carried oft her
diamonds and money.
The costly gems were encased in a
heart-shaped repousee Bilver Jewel case
lined with blue velvet, and when Mrs.
Bertsch left her apartments to go down
town it was lying in the left hand side
of the drawer. The money was wrapped
up in a statement of her account for the
month at the hotel and was lying be
side the Jewel case. The thief lifted the
jewel case out of the drawer carefully,
pocketed the money, closed the drawer
and left the room in the same condition
as when Mrs. Bertsch left to go down
town.
As soon as Mrs. Bertsch discovered her
loss she telephohned to Chief Lees and
he detailed several of his Hawkshaws to
find the thief. The detectives went at
once to the hotel and took a description
of Mrs. Bertsch's jewels, and ever since
have been scouring the town in search
of a clew to the identity of the bold day
light maurauder. The pawnshops have
been thoroughly searched, but the miss
ing Jewels nave not yet been located.
Mrs. Bertsch firmly believes that the
robbery was committed by some of the
employes of the Bella Vista. She has in
formed everybody connected with the ho
tel that she will give a reward of $100, or
even more, for the return of the missing
Jewels and no questions asked.
In addition to their intrinsic value. Mrs.
Bertsch considers her lost jewels price
less, as many of them are gifts from her
husband and other members of her
family.
The guests of the Bella Vista are both
alarmed and mystified over the looting
of Mrs. Bertsch's apartments. The
time-honored custom of hanging their
keys on the hook in the elevator has been
suddenly abandoned and the proprietor of
the hotel has placarded the walls with
written notices requesting the guests to
leave their keys at the office when they
go out.
The robbery promises to go down in the
records of the Police Department as an
other one of unsolved mysteries of Chief
Lees' regime.
The only persons having access to the
apartments were Mrs. Bertsch, the Chi
nese servant and the elevator boy. all of
whom had keys. The detectives who
an working on the case, are quite posi
tive that the Chinese servant did not com
mit the robbery, as they say it is not the
custom of the Chinese to steal Jewelry.
The elevator boy is also above suspicion
because, when Mrs. Bertsch left the hotel
she left the key to her apartments in his
possession, ana it is not likely that he
would chance almost certain detection
under the circumstances. Everybody in
terested in the case is having a rather
hard time trying to figure out how the
thief gained access to the hotel, and then
to Mrs. Bertsch's rooms, without being
seen by somebody. During the day the
front door is always locked and the col
ored bell boy sits at the door to receive
the cards of visitors. The key of the
room was not removed from the elevator,
so the boy claims, during Mrs. Bertsch's
absence.
Taking all of the above circumstances
into consideration. Mrs. Bertsch is con
vinced that somebody in the hotel com
mitted the robbery. About a month ago
a Chinaman who pretended to be a laun
dryman got Into the hotel and succeeded
In stealing several valuable pieces of jew
elry from one of the guests. He made
his escape, but was afterward arrested
by Detective Ed Gibson.
""I was never more surprised in my life
than when I returned home Thursday aft
ernoon and discovered that my jewel case
and all had been stolen, said Mrs.
Bertsch last night. "I set the $66 aside
from other money I had in the room, in
tending to settle my account with it. The
room was not disturbed In the slightest.
When I returned the first thing I did was
to open the drawer to get the money
which was wrapped up in a statement ot
my account here at the hotel. My eye
instinctively fell on the vacant spot
where my jewel case should have been
It was gone I looked for the money, and
that too was missing. I ran across the
nafl and reported the matter to my moth
er and she advised me to report the case
tO "Thl ef defectives came here and ques
tioned everybody connected w ith the ho
tel but If they had any suspicions they
did not relate them to me. Most of the
Web were gifts, and I would not part
wHhth^m voluntarily for twice their
v^lue in money. It is rather strange how
a person could get into this hotel and get
out again without being seen by some
body I believe that the thief was some
body who knew just where I kept my
jewelry. Detective Ed Gibson is working
on the case, and I have confidence in his
ability to find the thief." ._..,_
Mrs. Bertsch has furnished Chief Lees
with a complete description of the stolen
jewelry Mrs. Bertsch is a woman of
culture and refinement, and her jewels
were strictly in keeping with her per
sonality. Among the stolen jewelry was !
a lady's gold watch, a beautiful Marquis i
ring set with three opals, and several
diamonds, several plain diamond rings, a
cat'seye link bracelet, twelve diamond i
breastpins, several amethyst rings and
breastpins, a diamond star breastpin with
a heart of pearls in the center, a Mar
quis pearl ring set with costly olivlnes,
two gold neck chains and a lady's watch
with gentleman's silk ribbon fob with
gold buckle.
LAID AT REST.
Last Tribute of Bespect to Captain
J. H. Sturke, the Weil-Known
Newspaper Man.
The last tribute of respect to the mem
ory of Captain J. H. Sturke was paid
Sunday afternoon when a number of
newspaper men gathered at Gray's un
dertaking parlors and accompanied the
hearse containing the remains to the first
Unitarian Church, where an impressive
service was delivered by Rev. Dr. Stop
ford Brooke.
After the service the cortege proceeded
to I-aurel Hill Cemetery, where the body
was interred. Both in his military and
newspaper career the late captain made a
host of friends and his untimely end was
a. surprise and blow to them.

WILLIAM QUANE
Assemblyman Before
Judge Mogan.
MANSLAUGHTER IS CHARGED
SAYS THE OLD MAN MET DEATH
ACCIDENTALLY.
Case Taken Tinder Advisementâ By a
Singular Coincidence Defendant's
Father Attempted to Commit
Suicide Yesterday.
The preliminary examination of As
semblyman Charles F. Kenneally on the
charge of manslaughter was held before
Judge Mogan yesterday. Attorney Din
kelsplel appeared as special prosecutor,
and Attorney Ach represented the de
fe K>nneally was accused of causing the
death of William Quane. the old printer
who lived in South Park, at ThW and
Brannan streets, on December B last
The case has been continued from time to
time since then, owing to the Aaaembly
man's enforced attendance at Sacra
mento during the balloting for Lnited
States Senator.
The most important witnesses for the
prosecution were Frank Cook and George
F Lawson. Both testified to having seen
Kenneally and the old man quarreling,
and Cook swore that Kenneally struck
Quane, who staggered back and fell.
Lawson differed with Cook inasmuch as
he swore that Kenneally pushed the old
man back and his feet got entangled in
a leash by which he was holding two
greyhounds, and he fell. Both testified
that Kenneally picked the old man up
and got some whisky for him at a saloon
near the scene of the affray.
Kenneally In his own defense testified
that Quane had been owing him a bill
for $8 for storage of his wagon and buggy.
On December 29 he met him and asked
him when he intended to settle *he bill.
Quane made use of strong language and
said he would not pay a cent. The old
man grew angry in discussing the mat
ter and raised his foot to kick defendant,
who put his open hand on his breast and
shoved him back. Quane stumbled over
the leash attached to the two greyhounds
and fell, striking on the back of his head.
Defendant did everything he could for
him and sent him home in a bus. He
swore positively that he did not strike
the old man.
The Judge said he would look over the

sumed the mani

fo faithfully, and
despite the many
changes of admin

never been dis

His title of

throughout all the

been made in the

He is, in reality,
the confidential

He has been a sufferer for over a year
from asthma, which made him despon

was only able to make a flesh wound.
He was sent to the Receiving Hospital in

STEER CLEAR OF IT!
"When a laundry sends your linen
home with frayed edges and spread-
eagle button holes steer clear of it and
send your linen to an up-to-date laun-
dry, where the management knows Its
business and sends your work home
every time with as beautiful and Im-
maculate color, and as perfect a finish
as when first purchased. That you will
find Is always done at the United States
laundry.
