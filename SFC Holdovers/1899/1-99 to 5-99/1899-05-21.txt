DEWEY NOW
IS ON THE
WAY HOME
The Admiral Sails in the
Olympia From the Bay
of Manila.
He Will Make a Leisurely Trip
Through the Suez Canal and
the Mediterranean.
Dewey has started for home. The brave admiral, on board his
flagship, the Olympia, sa/leo from Mam/a yesterday amia the booming
of great guns, and will make a leisurely journey to New York by way
of the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean.
The admiral, it is to be regretted, did not see fit to come home
by way of San Francisco. In this connection it is significant that in
an interview just before he left Manila Dewey observed that if he
were twenty years younger and had political ambition he would not
miss a chance like that Clearly, he will not be a candidate for the
Presidency.
MANILA. -May 20.â cruiser j
Olympia with Admiral Dewey
on board, left here on her home
ward journey to the United
States at 4 o'clock this after
noon. As she steamed away the Ore
gon, Baltimore and Concord fired an
admiral's salute. At the first shot the
band on the flagship played a lively air
and the crew crowded the decks and
cheered. As the Olympia passed the
Oregon the crew of that battleship
pave nine cheers for the Olympians, i
who responded by throwing their caps
so high that dozens of them were left
bobbing in the wake of the cruiser.
Then followed the noisiest half hour
known in this harbor since the battle ,
which linked its name with that of
Dewey. The din of guns and ( brass
bands echoed through the smoke,. a fleet i
of steam launches shrieked their
whistles, the musicians of .the. Baltir
more played "Home, Sweet Home,'*
hei* flags signaled "Good-by," and those j
of the Oregon said "Pleasant voyage."
The merchant vessels in these waters j
dipped their flags, the ladies on the j
decks of the vessels of the fleet waved
handkerchiefs, and the great black j
British cruiser Powerful, which lay the
furthest out, saluted the Olympia. The
latter's band played "God Save the
Queen." and to this the crew of the
Powerful responded with hearty cheers
for the Olympia.
The last music heard from Dewey's
ship was "Auld Lang Syne," while the j
guns from the forts at Cavite and from
the Monterey, on guard off Paranaqua,
too far to be audible, puffed white
clouds of smoke.
The Olympia was disappearing past
Corregidor Island when a battery be
fore the walled city spoke Manila's last
word of farewell.
Admiral Dewey sat on the deck of
the Hympia and received the adieus of
his friends during most of the day. The
launch of General Otis was first to ar
rive alongside the cruiser at 7 o'clock
this morning, and afterward the ad
miral landed and called* upon the
major general and the United States
Philippine Commission. Admiral Dewey
is enthusiastic over his home going,"
but while he appreciates the friendship
of his countrymen deeply he hopes they
will not be too demonstrative. He in
tends to go directly to his home at
Montpelier, Vt.. and will live there.
Just before the Olympia sailed I went
aboard her and interviewed Admiral
Dewey on his departure. In response
to my Inquiries he said:
"I leave Manila to-day. I go with
less regret because I believe that this
insurrection Is breaking up. Repeated
arrivals in our lines of emissaries sent
from the insurgent headquarters can
only mean one thing. They point to the
inevitable end.
"Now, had I consulted my pride, I
would have remained here till peace
was finally established. But there are
other things in a man's life besides his
pride to be considered. My health, for
instance, has been gradually under
mined by the long strain placed upon
me, and by the constant care that has
been necessarily imposed upon me for
bo long a time. And, of course, we are
glad to get home.
"One of the things that touched me
most, among all the many expressions
of warm feeling from the people at
home, was the raising of a subscription
in my native Stateâ it was started at
Boston, I believe â to build a bronze
statue of me to be placed in the State
house at Montpelier opposite the statue
of Ethan Allen.
-'Many a time, as a boy, have I looked
at that statue of Ethan Allen in wonder
and admiration. The inscription, if I
remember rightly, is: 'Surrender in the
name of the Great Jehovah and the
Continental Congress.'
'â¢The way I feel is that no greater
compliment could be paid me than the
erection of my statue in such a place in
my own village, you know."
Being told that the people wanted
him to. go home by way of San Fran
cisco and across the continent, the Ad
miral replied: "if I were twenty years
younger and had political ambitions I
would not miss that chance."
Captain Walker of the Concord, the
last of the commanders here who was
in the battle before Cavite, went to the
Admiral to-day and said: "Don't leave
me behind." So he was relieved and
goes home on the Olympia.
ANXIOUS TO RECEIVE
DEWEY'S ITINERARY
NEW YORK, May 20.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
The San Francisco Call.
following: Rear Admiral Crownin
shield. chief of the bureau of naviga
tion, told me to-day he believes that
Admiral Dewey will not speed the
Olympia. The department has left en
tirely to that officer the determination
of time when he shall arrive at New
York, and Rear Admiral Crowninshield
seems to think that he will not reach
his destination until fall. To settle the
matter there is reason to believe that
the department will cable to the ad
miral when the Olympia reaches Hong
kong, requesting to be advised of the
outline of his itinerary. The receipt of
this information will be valuable to the
President and the department as well
as to the public. Mr. McKinley is
naturally desirous of knowing when to
expect the admiral, as that officer re
tains his membership on the Philippine
Commission and besides is -charged
with presenting to the chief executive
the views of his colleagues on the en
tire Philippine question.
Secretary Long would like to have an
idea of the time of the admiral's arri
val, in order that he may make prepar
ations for his reception. These prepar
ations will probably take the form of
orders to Rear Admiral Sampson to
meet the Olympia with the squadron
under his command at some point to be
designated just as soon as the route of
the admiral's flagship is ascertained.
If the admiral should decide that he
ought to come home without delay,
though not forcing the Olympia, he will
be able to arrive in New York in sixty
days, or about July 26. From Hongkong
the Olympia will proceed to Singapore,
thence to Colombo, where she will take
on coal, and from Colombo will go to
Aden. It may be considered advisable
to replenish the Olympia's coal supply
at that port, and then she will con
tinue her cruise, stopping next at Suez,
whore arrangements will be made for
th<: vessel's passage through the canal.
Once through the canal the Olympia
will turn her prow to the westward,
and if the admiral desires, to take a
leisurely cruise, he will probably order
ill" olympia to various ports along the
.Mediterranean, stopping at Malta and
Gibraltar, where the English garrisons
will probably pleasantly greet him.
From Gibraltar the Olympia will sail
for the Azores, and then for New York.

GREAT RIVALRY IN
SUBSCRIBING FOR DEWEY
NEW YORK, May 20.â The Brooklyn
Eagle this evening says: "Not only has
the Admiral Dewey house fund become
a matter of national interest, but it
looks now as if there would be friendly
rivalry among the cities of the Union
as to the number of subscribers that
would be placed upon the roll, which
will be handed to Admiral Dewey when
the presentation is made. Every city
has taken a sort of pride In pushing the
subscription along. The old civic pride
for Brooklyn is apparent, for the mere
mention of the fact that San Francisco
had up to this day subscribed $1508 sent
Brooklyn subscriptions bounding up, so
that they now top those of the city of
the Golden Gate. It is apparent that
the Brooklyn borough is not going to be
beaten by San Francisco in this pa
triotic enterprise, and letters which
have been received show that a strong
feeling of rivalry exists."
WALES LIKES TO HEAR
AMERICAN WHISTLERS
Has Greatly Enjoyed the Talent of
Mrs. Shaw and Clever Frank
Lawton.

don Bennett.
LONDON, May 20.â The Prince of
Wales' great pleasure in hearing Mrs.
ShaW whistle was frequently the cause
of that lady appearing at many social
functions. His Royal Highness evidently
enjoys the keen notes, of slffieurs, for ho
has id two occasions shown his apprecia
tion of the whistling of Frank Lawton of
â¢â The Bell of New York" Company by re
questing him to appear before him.
Last week at the Grafton galleries the
Prince was very much amused by the
American's clever rendering of negro mel
odies, and at t/ie cafe chantant of the
Hotel Cecil on Monday night, his Royal
Highness arriving late and being told that
Lawton . had contributed .to the pro
gramme earlier in the evening, requested
that he be asked to whistle again. Law
ton wa.Â» dug up out of a corner of . the
smoking room of the hotel, rushed , up
stairs and was soon whistling away, de
lighting the Prince and a large audience
with the : same clear notes which , many
American audiences have enjoyed In the
past. j

THE OLYMPIA HOMEWARD BOUND.
FOUR MILLION DOLLAR
FIRE SWEEPS DAWSON
Entire Business Section of the Klondike
Metropolis Destroyed by a
Conflagration,
VICTORIA, B. C, May 20.âAn
other disastrous fire has visited
Dawson City, this time wiping
out the entire business center of
the Klondike metropolis and cre
ating losses that will aggregate over
i 14,000,000, with scarcely a dollar of in
j surance. It is believed that several
i persons perished in the conflagration.
The news was brought from Dawson ,
' t>y r. Hume of Seattle and T. Reilly. ''
\ who made the trip out with the new?
at the risk of their lives, for the ice is
broken and unsa,fe. They were obliged j
i to make big detours and experienced
great privations. Hume is a son of ex-
Mayor Hume of Seattle.
They report that the fire occurred on
April 26 in the very center of the city.
It commenced near the opera house, on
the water front. Spreading with un
usual rapidity, fanned by a strong
northeast wind, it destroyed building
after building, eating its way down the ;
street to and including Donahue & i
Smith's establishment and taking in all
i the water front buildings abreast of the
j same blocks. In other words, the fire
crossed the street, burned through and
spread over to Second street, covering
the principal business portion of Daw
-1 son, leaving it all in ashes, with the
i firemen helpless and powerless to do
anything. The fire consumed every
thing from Tlmmlns' Royal Cafe down
to and opposite the Fairview Hotel.
It was a terrible conflagration, for,
said Mr. Rielly. every building burned
like tinder. They had been standing
two years and the logs were as dry as
! powder. The whole place seemed to be
| a sea of roaring and leaping flames.
I The excitement was intense. As ~ the
I flames raced along the streets, crack
i ling and roaring, the citizens ran panic
i stricken before them, unable to save
anything in the way of furniture, goods
or clothing. Everything that the
greater number of them possessed was
1 swept away and hundreds will be des
titute. There will be a great deal of
i suffering if not actual starvation in
! mans cases.
Among the firms known to have been
burned out were the Bank of British
I North America, the McDonald block,
McLellan-& MdFeely, Parsons Produce
Company, Royal Cafe, Donahue &
Smith, Aurora saloon. Bodega, Madden
House, Hotel Victoria. â¢
These were the only destroyed places

LONDON, May 20.â How not to get sol

WASHINGTON. May 20.â The President
' and Mrs. McKinley, with the friends who
accompanied them, reached Washington
j at 5:30 p. m. to-day. The stay of twelve

This fire came at a time when the
mills and dealers in building materials

result is that there is a dearth of all

JACOB VETTER.
HUENEME, May 20.â following article, dated "San Diego, May â¢
11," which appeared in The Call on May 12, is of more than passing &
interest to the people of Hueneme: â â  Â«
E. E. Clark of this city, .who, is in the engineering department aboard â¢<
the United States steamship" Philadelphia, writes to his father, John Clark, Â£
from Apia, under date of April 19, saying: \
"There was a fellow shipped from San Diego as a steward. He was a Â«
German, and when he got here he went ashore tc buy groceries, but never .
came back. They say he. was a spy. A seaman named Stiefer says he saw â¢
the deserter in a fight our men had with the rebels and shot him. He says he |J
is sure of It, and most of the fellows aboard believe him." . Z

The subject of this article, it is believed, is a young German named 4
Jacob'' Vetter, who was employed for nearly two years as baker in the *
establishment of Z. D. Shiprnan here. He gave up his position the latter o<
part of January and after selling most of his effects started on his bi- 4
cycle for Arizona, where he . hoped to obtain more remunerative em- *
ployment. Several weeks later it was 4 learned Vetter had shipped as g
steward on the cruiser Philadelphia at San Diego. . . . '4
In a letter from Apia dated April, 15 to Albert Karcher of Hueneme, 8!
the young man gives 1 no inkling of an intention to: betray the country g
of his adoption, but it would- seem that he was taken captive /upon 4
landing at Apia while sent â¢ to' purchase groceries for' the ship. From
his letter the inference is drawn that if he was the â  young German gj

JAMES. D. PHEL4N - - President
CLAUS SPRECKELS, Ist Vice Pres't
IRVING M. SCOTT, 2d Vice Preset
CAPT. H. fl. FLETCHER, Secretary
Treasurer - A baak to be selected
THESE are the representative
men selected by the Dewey
Statue Committee at its meet
ing yesterday in the office of
his Honor, Mayor James D.
Phelan. In addition to the chief execu
tive the members present were Irving
M. Scott, C. L. Patton, Professor C. H.
Murphy, Charles Bundschu, W. G.
Stafford. George D. Clark, Joseph S.
Tobin, Captain R. H. Fletcher, R. P.
Schwerin and Horace G. Platt.
The dominant tone of comment from
the men gathered in the name of the
people of this city was that the pro
posed movement to honor Admiral
George Dewey and the men wh<> fought
with him at Manila was assured of suc
cess from the outset. That Dewey of
all living Americans holds the first
place in the estimation of the people
of this coast was sMown by the efforts
put forth to induce him to return to
the land he has so ably represented
through the Golden Gate. A small. part
of the energy which would have been
expended on the greeting accorded him
had he returned this way will, if di
rected toward providing a suitable
monument, yield grand results.
After the organization of the com
mittee yesterday an informal discus
sion en3ued as to the probable cost of
the statue and the most appropriate
location. It was suggested that from
$100,000 to $150,000 would be required
and the gentlemen of the committee
seemed confident they could raise the
amount without difficulty. It is not
proposed to make this a local move
ment, limited merely to the metropoli
tan district, but one to be taken up
throughout the State. The committee
men will strive earnestly to press the
matter to a successful issue and have
MAKE THE STATUE HISTORICAL
SAN FRANCISCO, May 20, 1899.
To the Editor of The Callâ My Dear Sir: Referring to your adv.i- I
cacy of building a monument or statue in honor of Admiral Dewey, to â¦
be erected in Golden Gate Park in commemoration of the great naval
achievement by Admiral Dewey in Manila Ba; I have already given ex- <
pression to my views in relation to the matter and most heartily com- *
mend the public spirit which prompted your excellent paper to inaugu-
rate this movement. I think this plan far more appropriate than build-
ing a house for him in Washington.
I desire to suggest in this connection, provided it meets with the â +
approval of our citizens, that I will offer a resolution when Congress <$
meets 'asking the Government to place at the disposal of the peopje of ~t
San Francisco through the special committee appointed, of which the Â«.
Mayor is an ex-offlcio member, the brass cannon captured at Cavite
and Manila. These cannon we can Have melted and cast into a bronze <
statue of Admiral Dewey and such other appropriate emblems in con- â¦
nection with the monument which would commemorate the valor of the
admiral and those who took part in that memorable conflict. It seems /t,
to me that such use of these cannon would be most appropriate and â¦
more beautiful and useful from an artistic standpoint than as useless *
cannon, and would be an enduring monument of the valor of our sailors. %
Yours truly, GEORGE C. PERKINS. â¦

a sculptor at work on marble or bronze
at an early date.
Mayor Phelan complimented his as
sociates on their leanings toward the
artistic, saying: he felt assured they
would select a design that would be an
ornament to the city. He holds strong
ideas on the subject of the "City Beau
tiful," believing Market street should
be dotted with artistic groups of statu
ary. He has done his share in this re
gard as shown in the fountain sym
bolical of California which he dedicated j
to the Native Sons. His Honor believes j
every gore on the north side of Mar^Ll I
street from the ferry to Van Ness ave
nue should be ornamented with artistic
%roups of statuary. -
The standard of art has been raised
materially in recent years on this coast.
This is marked by the rejection of the
Garfleld and Grant monuments and by
the interest manifested in art exhibi
tions of all kinds. To educate the pub
lic and devfelop in them a desire for
the artistic the Mayor would erect
statues wherever possible. The Dewey
monument he would place where every
body entering the city would see it
without being compelled to go in quest
of it.
The gentlemen of the committee have
no misgivings as to the possibility of
raising the funds required. They did
not discuss that detail of their duties
yesterday, leaving it in the hands of
their executive committee to map out
a plan of campaign. This will be sub
mitted at the next meeting in the office
of Mayor Phelan on Tuesday. Decks
will then be cleared for action and the
collection of funds commenced In
earnest
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
In giving an official title to the com
mittee yesterday it was determined to
call it "A committee to erect a monu
ment to the American navy in com
memoration of the victory of Admiral
Dewey at Manila." It will thus honor
the gallant "Jackies" who fought un
der the Stars and Stripes, making
Dewey the central figure.
The question of collections has yet to
be settled by the general committee.
The members will have decided upon a
plan of action on Tuesday, and the
work of getting the contributions will
begin immediately. It is well to heed
the Scriptural injunction in this par
ticular: "He that gives quickly gives
doubly."
Upon the assembling of the gentle
men selected by his Honor the Mayor,
Irving M. Scott moved that a tempor
ary organization be effected. Mayor
Phelan sketched in outline the objects
for which they had been called to
gether, saying it was the intention to
erect a monument in honor of the navy
and of Admiral George Dewey. He
said the matter was still vague and
that it would devolve upon the com
mittee to determine where the monu
ment should be placed when completed;
its character and its cost. He was con
fident from the number of men of artis
tic temperament on the committee tV *t
a monument would be selected which
would be a lasting credit to the me
whom it was intended to honor.
There was a tone of, regret in his
voice when ho said the Grant and Gar
field monuments had been finally re
jected as not being up to the required
standard. He felt assured the mem
bers of the committee would all take
an active part in the present move
ment, and that the monument would be
built before any other community can
honor the heroes of Manila.
Upon motion of Mr. Scott, Captain
R. H. Fletcher, curator of the Art As
sociation, was appointed temporary
secretary. Upon rollcall the following
gentlemen were voted present: James
D. Phelan, Irving M. Scott, R. P.
Schwerin, W. G. Stafford, Charles L.
Patton, Joseph S. Tobin, Professor C.
H. Murphy. Charles Bundschu, George
D. Clark, Horace G. Platt and Captain
Fletcher.
The matter of permanent organiza
tion was then approached. Mayor Phe
lan, at the urgent solicitation of the
gentlemen present, agreed to act as
chairman of the committee, saying he
felt assured the work which had been
undertaken would be pressed to a suc
cessful issue. Claus Spreckels was
chosen first vice president, Irving M.
Scott, second vice president; Captain
Fletcher, secretary. The chairman was
empowered to select either a bank or
an individual as custodian of the funds
which will be collected.
Che question as to what number
should constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business was then de.
bated. Mr. Clark favored seven, while
Mr. Patton favored five as being a good
working number. Mr. Platt and Mr.
Stafford both thought five too small
a number,, considerinr the responsibili
ties which must devolve upon them
when questions of resign and location
must be determined. The judgment of
many people will be obtained to the end
that the best selection may be made.
Mr. Patton urged that the public want
the first and best monument, and that
a competent working majority was de
sirable. The motion that seven of the
eighteen members constitute a quorum
finally prevailed.
Mr. Scott suggested that the chair,
man and secretary retire and prepare
rules under which the committee could
work with the best results, and also
to name the sub-committees. The first
and second vice presidents were added
to the committee on organization.
Mr. Bundschu. who is one of the most
enthusiastic supporters of the project,
urged that the entire committee act ac2
a finance committee, saying that upon
the energy displayed in that direction
tided the succ< ss of the movement.
All must work in harmony and the Jl-
sired outcome is assured.
The discussion then became general
many Interesting points were
brought nut. Mayor Phelan suggested
that each "member of the committee
have allotted him the task pf seeing
â¢r.M-cnt branches of trade.
This would result, he said, in their
( rossing one anoth< re paths in the col
lection of money. His Honor also
Btarted a discussion as to the estimated
amount required to carry -nit the plan
on broad lines. It was the consensus
of opinion that the statue should cost
1., twei 0 and $150,000.
Ml thought there would bo
but little difficulty in raising $150,006,
which would provide a group in keep-
Ing with the achievements "f Admiral
Dewey and be a credit t<> this city. Mr.
Plati ed that the minimum be
00, that being an excellent figure
on which to work. Mr. Stafford re.

It was filially decided to leave the
naming of the amount required to the
organization committee, which will

buildii
His Honor suggested that the secur
: subscriptions be commenced at
. but it was finally decided to await
the next meetii taking any ac
tion. The fixing of the amount t" be
i will be discussed seriously, as h
was plain that in setting the amount
et," '.be rust Inquiry
usually made in such casts by a sut>
scriber being, "What i.- the total
amount to he raised?"
Mayor Phelan said a mere statue
could be provided foi $25,000, but that
an Imposing monument would cost at
$100,000. It would require :i sub
al figure to attract the attention
n men as St. Gaud I Story,

monument in Golden Gate Park.
In selecting a name for the commit
tee its purpose was ;-â¢ : forth as "A
tnittee to erect a monument to the
American navy in com] n of

nila. '
The question of location was to;:
itly. Some members of the
tittee joined Mayor Phelan i
advocacy of a downtown site, where

tlemen present upon the work they had

RAILROAD CRAFT IN
THE CIRCUIT COURT
Cunning Attempt to Evade Costs
in the Grain Rate Cases,
How a "Joker " Was Placed in the Petition to Judge
Morrow The State Will Demand Costs of Suit
and Probably Heavy Penalties.
JUDGE MORROWS dismissal of the
grain rate cases, upon motion of
the Southern Pacific Company, has
created widespread comment and
a general suspicion that the rail
mad people took their unexpected ac
tion for some crafty purpose not read
ily apparent. There is an absolute cer
tainty that the Southern Pacific Com
pany did not wish to have the cases
dismissed upon its own motion. Two
Railroad Commissioners were dishon
ored in an effort to have the cases
thrown out of the Circuit Court in an
other way, and it is idle to suppose that
the railroad company would honestly do
what it forced public officials dishon
estly to attempt. The railroad company
was fearful that if it dismissed the
it would be compelled to pay the.
;osti? and probably the enormous penal
ties provided for a disobedience of the
->rder of the Railroad Commission made
in September, 1895.
Notwithstanding this fear the South
ern Pacific Company has dismissed the
suns, and with its customary craft it
is striving to escape the consequences
of Its own action. Through a cleverly
i address to Judge Morrow the
railroad company hopes to escape both
costs and penalties by making it ap
pear that the Southern Pacific Com
pany simply consented to the motion of
the Railroad Commission to dismiss-the
r-ases and did not of its own motion ask
-missal. With this lame and cheap
subterfuge, which Judge Morrow ig
nored, the railroad hopes to cheat the
State.
In the address, which was written
and signed by William F. Herrin and
i:. S. Pillsbury and is therefore a docu
ment of record in the Circuit Court, are
:hese words: "The complainant hereby
:;ts that st.i.t cause be and the
same is hereby dismissed."
Judge Morrow utterly ignored this
phrasing and made the final decree of
dismissal as follows: "The complain
ant, having on this, the Huh day of
May. 1599, produced and filed in open
c< nit its dismissal of this suit, it is
hereby ordered and decreed that the
said cause be and the same is hereby
dismissed." ;
It is upon this decree and not upon
the crafty wording of the railroad pe
tition that the question of the costs of
the suits will be decided. Judge Mor
row has already given an emphatic ex
pression of his opinion of those who
trifle with the court, and his decree
shows conclusively that he understood
that the Southern Pacific Company
plainly asked for a dismissal of the
suits.
Having done so, the Southern Pacific
Company made itself clcurly responsi
ble for the costs and a demand for th^e?
costs will be made to-morrow in be
half of the State. Attorney General
F rd, Judge Hayr.e and W. W. Footc
have already had an informal discus
sion of the matter and they have de
termined to present a complete bill oi
costs. The Southern Pacific Company
will cor.test the claim, basing its flghl
upon the quibble in its petition. The
railroad, in this affair, has added one
more outrage to ttu' many it has at
tempted in the litigation. It has de
liberately attempted to impose upor
Judge Morrow and with the impositior.
cheat the State.
Attorney General Ford. Judge Haynt
and W. W. Foote have not yet decided
what they shall do in reference to the
penalties, to which it is claimed, the
Southern Pacific Company has subject
ed itself under the constitution. A
rence will be held at an early day
probably to-morrow or Tuesday, and
the representatives of the State will
then determine upon a course of ac
tion.
"We will do cvervthinf in our pow-
er." said Attorney General Ford, last
night, "to protect the rights of the
State. The dismissal of the case came
as a complete surprise to me. and I
have not yet hud an opportunity to
confer at length with Judge Hayne and
Mr. Foote. A.a for the exaction of the
penalties, that is a question which we
must yet consider seriously and I do
r.ot rare at present to express an opin
ion in reference to it."
W. W. Foote was asked last even
ing what will be the prospective action ;
of the State in connection with the
grain rate cases. He replied: "The
cases have been dismissed and no fur- j
ih r action can be taken as I under
stand it until the Railroad Commis-
Bionen formulate some other schedule. |
The present status of the cases, as I
understand it, is that the whole mat
ter is wiped out â eliminated."
Mr. Foote was also asked whether |
th<- dismissal of the suit on the part of |
the Southern Pacific Company, dis
missed the whole affair, including the ;
25 per cent reduction, ar.d he replied
that it did. "Rut by the way." said^
he, "that never was insisted upon by
the State or its attorneys in tho litiga
tion which recently terminated In the i
United States Circuit Court."
When asked whether the railroad
company would suffer the penalty of
the law for disobeying the.. order made
by the Railroad Commission, Mr. Foote
said he did not like to commit himself
on the question as he had not examined
it closely. He admitted that it had been
the subject of discussion between him
self. Judge Hayne and Attorney Gen
eral Ford, but they had not as yet come
to any conclusion.
off hand," he continued. "I should
say, it is quite possible that the suit
having been dismissed. It was the Idea
of the railroad company that that
would relieve it from all the pains and
penalties contained in the constitution
and lavs of the State of California.
This, in my judgment, applies both to
the fines and imprisonment. If the
penalties could be exacted the order
having been violated so many times.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAT 21, 1899.
its enforcement in the courts would
practically bankrupt the company.
"I received this afternoon a copy of
the written dismissal of the decree of
the court, which I had not examined
before. The peculiarity about this pro
ceeding: was that the written dismissal
was signed by Mr. Herrin as solicitor
and by Mr. Plllsbury as counsel for the
railroad company, so that the order of
dismissal was signed as a fact. It says
that on the 9th day of May the court
directed the Attorney GeneraJ to dis
miss the cases, but the conclusion of
the dismissal says that the railroad at
torneys being aware of that fact came
in and consented that the court should
grant the motion made by the Attorney
General. This, in my judgment, was
not a dismissal on the part of the com
plainants, but the consent to a dis
missal on the part of the railroad com
pany, and it was probably carefully
framed to defeat the State in any effort
that might be mad.- to recover its costs
from the railroad company. Upon this
written decr< c Judge Morrow bas^d and
issued a short decree in which he dis
miss.-.] the rapes and drafted the order
of dismissal as though it was made
upon the part of the complainants
themselves.
"I have no doubt that Judge Morrow's
decree will hold and that the State will
recover its costs. However, upon this
subject we have not thoroughly made
up our minds. Early in the week Mr.
Hayne. the Attorney General and my
self will have a consultation and we
will take every precaution to proteci
the rights of the State."

Ex-Chiefs of the Club Which Has Won an Enviable Name for Pro

TO commemorate the thirty-third annual gathering and games of the Caledonian Cub that will he held in Shell i
Mound Park on Decoration day the ex-chiefs, eight in number, have had a group tnken, which will be placed in !
Scottish Hall. The ex-chiefs arc D. A. Macdonald, Colin M. Bo yd, John F. Kennedy, Angus McLeod, W. C. Bur- i
nett, Christopher Chisholm, D. R. MeN'eill and John Reid, who am still taking an active interest in the success of '
thr cluh, which is acknowledged to be one of the wealthiest of its kind on this continent.
A brief sketch of the cluh may not be out of place. In 1563 Donald McLay. James Aitken, John Rain. George T !
Scott, Clem Dixon and -a few other Scotchmen mot and agreed to hold a picnic with the object' of practicing and perpetu- :
ating some of the ancient games of Scotland, and the first gathering of the clans war. held that year at Hayes Park in I
Hayes Valley. In 1884 the gathering was held in Sausalito. and as a result Caledonia avenue, the principal street In the i
town. Is named after the club. In 18fi r i the outing was held at the White House, on Mission street, between Twt-nty- '
first and Twenty-second, and it met with such unexpected success that in lSGfi the club was organized and held the first '
annual gathering and games at the Recreation grounds, between Folsom and Harrison streets and Twenty-fourth and '
Twenty-sixth streets. j
In 1887 Donald McLennan was elected the first chief of the club, who held office for four years. David Mitchell sue- â¢
ceeded him and served for two years, and Stewart Menzies served for one year. D. A. Macdonald was elected in 1574 '
and served for flvr years, and it was during his administration that the club met with such unparalleled success that j
Its name was brought prominently before the people of the United States as the first club to encourage athletic sports '
before the public. Colin M. Boyd was chief in 1879 and served for two years; John P. Kennedy for three' years- D \
MacdOsato, two years; -Angus McLeod. three years; W. C. Burnett, three years; Christopher Chisholmi two' years- '
D. R. McNeill, three years, and John Reid, one. year. Angus McLeod is chief for the present year. â  ' !
Although organized for social and athletic purposes only, the club dispenses a great deal in charity, and during
the big fires in Boston, Chicago and Seattle several years ago it subscribed liberally toward the destitute. Within the '
paÃl two years the club has donated a handsome sum toward the erection of a monument in Golden Gate Park to Scot- '<

Organizations in All Parts of the
United States Unite to Give

The encroachments being made upon
the liberties of the people of Finland by
the Czar of Russia have aroused local
Finns to an effort to do something in be
half of their native land. They have al
| ready organized a movement to secure
| an expression of public opinion, and by
! petition and mass-meeting's will seek to
I enlist the sympathies of Americans in
; their cause. They are emphatically op
j posed to the Russianizing of Finland, and
' will ask the people of this country to
aid them in making their protest effect
ive.
The movement is not by any means
! confined to this city. A committee repre
senting the Finns of Michigan has al
ready been to Washington. They have
j been promised the hearty co-operation of
j United States Senator McMillan and have
â  had an interview with President MeKin

I their pleading. Several informal confer
' ences were held with members of the
American delegation to the Czar's peace
conference, and a promise was given that
! the matter will be made a matter of dis
i cussion at the conference, if possible.
The affair has therefore been a sub
ject of great agitation in this country and
the local Finn? determined to take up

Through the medium of mass-meetings
the relation between Finland and Russia
will be shown and then American citi

FIRST CLASS HARES
MADE GOOD COURSING
Some Decisions That Were Received
With Bad Favor by the Patrons
of the Game.
The hares at Union Park ran splendidly
yesterday; in fact, a marked improve
ment in their performances was mani
fest, but although the judge was evi
dently honest in his convictions, he made
some errors that were unpardonable.
The course between Snapshot and
Eclipse demoralized the talent who
played Snapshot to win at 5 to 1. Eclipse
truly got in for a turn and kill at the
linish. but that was all that could be
recorded to the dog's credit. Snapshot
led well at the start, took the first turn
and scored at least twenty points be
fore his opponent grot in as previously
stated for a turn and kill. Eclipse did
occasionally wrench a few times from
the turns made by Snapshot, but ac
cording to coursing rules wrenches of
this nature do not count, consequently
Snapshot should have won the flag with
several points in his favor. In the course
between Commodore Nash and Conqueror
the last named dog was first to game,
turned and wrenched several times, al
lowing Commodore Nash, by favoritism
of the hare, to get in for a turn and kill.
The nag went up for Commodore Nash,
much to the chagrin of the spectators,
who smiled but kept th.-ir counsel, fear
ing expulsion. The Royal Prize and Bo
nita course was another feature of the
day's racing which created considerable
talk.
The pikers who played the short ends
were made haimy when Mission Tip beat
Victor King; May Queen beat Lady Gil
more; Master Gordan beat Terrona;
Royal Oak beat Italia Rookh: Royal Buck
beat Glen Roy; Eclipse beat Snapshot;
Mercy May beat Beauty Spot, and Wag's
defeat of Rochester, who was a 5 to 1
shot.
Wag is an Australian bitch that made
her first appearance yesterday. She is a
magnificent worker, but rather slow in
Kitting to game. She will undoubtedly
be heard from later. Owing to an injury
which it is said Maori Land received
when exercising, the dog was withdrawn,
allowing his opponent, Mayflower, a bye.

SOLDIERS HAVE
ANOTHER SCARE
AT THE PRESIDIO
Thought the Small pox
Patient Had Fled.
RUMOR WAS SOON DISPROVED
HOSPITAL WILL BE KEPT IN
QUARANTINE TEN DAYS.
Original Detachment Ordered to Duty
About the Infected Quarters
Will Be Isolated With
the Patient.
There was a scare at the Presidio yes
terday, caused by the disappearance of
an immune who had been ordered to at
tend upon Private MoMurray, the colored
soldier afflicted with smallpox. It was
soon quelled, however, when the party
turned up late yesterday afternoon, and
after explaining his absence took up the
duties a&signed him.
When McMurray was taken to his place
of confinement at an isolated point of the
reservation John Wagner, Octave Gaiutch
er, Charles Haughton and Private Brun,
all immunes and members of th.c casual j
detachment, were detailed by Dr. Ware j
to serve as his attendants. One of the i
men suddenly absented himself without
leave, and the military authorities, think
ing that he was attempting to shirk the |
duties imposed upon him, started a de- i
taehment out to locate him and return
him to ihe Presidio.
Word was passed around among the sol
diers that the officials were in uuest of j
some one who had escaped, but they were ,
unable to learn the circumstances. The i
supposition spread that another soldier
had suddenly become stricken with the i
disease and had made an effort to escape.
In a short time the rumor gained propor- â â 
tions and fear of an epidemic caused
much uneasiness among the troops. Ap- |
prehension was dissipated when the au- j
thorities gave out the details of the case
and the circumstances of the disappear- i
ance.
The immune returned yesterday after
noon and went to headquarters. He stat
ed that, having received his pay on Fri
day, he believed it the proper caper to
celebrate before going into solitary con
finement, hence hied himself to the city,
where, after an overindulgence in steam
beer, he spent the night. He was imme
diately sent to the quarantine quarters,
and- says that he had no intention of
avoiding his duty.
A detachment of twelve men accom
panied the patient to the smallpox hos
pital. It was the intention of the author
ities to change the guard every twelve
hours, keeping the men a safe distance
from the point of contagion. In some
manner, however, the first detachment ex
posed itself and the unfortunate dozen
will be obliged to remain in quarantine
with the patient until all danger is
passed.
The post hospital will be kept in quar
antine for ten days, during which time it
will be thoroughly disinfected ,tnd all
nurses and attendants obliged to remain
within its confines. All the sick of the
post will be taken to the general hospital,
where they will be afforded treatment.
The patient is getting along nicely, and
no fears for the spread of the disease are
entertained.
STRONGLY FAVOR THE
NEWS $1 10 GAS RATE
IMPROVEMENT CLUBS PASS A
RESOLUTION.
H. G. Cupples Delivers a Warm Argu
ment Against Paying the Rate
Demanded by the Gas
Company.
The executive committee of the Feder
ation of Mission Improvement Clubs
held an interesting meeting last nighi
In Kairmount Hall. 11. G. Cupples, one of
the organizers of the Gas Consumers'
League, which is being formed to resist
the gas company's collecting $1 75 pi i
feet, appeared before the committee and
delivered a lively talk. In part he s;iid:
â¢'ln my work of organizing the consum
ers of gas to protect themselves as
against the gas company in its exactions
of the $1 7;> rate, when it is claimed tliat
the $1 10 rate is the legal maximum rate â¢
to be charged, I have found a very gen
eral sentiment in favor of actively resist- â 
ing the attempts of the company to en- i
force the higher rate by bulldozing meth
ods, or by the roundabout method of -
promising a refunding of a portion if the
lower rate is sustained. The only litiga
tion thus far started is in the so-called
'Hooper case," wherein the company has
brought suit against \v. B. Hooper for
the collection of his bill at the higher
rate. Owing to the press comments on
this ease there arc very grave doubts in
the minds of many people as to the out
come and how it will affect them. It does
not seem reasonable to suppose that thts
gas company would step in and so sud
denly select a person nnd open up ;; caa â 
to serve as a test of the rat<> if the facts
and conditions were not most favorable
to it.
"But even supposing that the conditions
surrounding this case were favorable for
a fair adjudication of the rate it lies
within the power of the gas company to
dismiss the action at any time' when its
interests can best he subserved and in
such event the matter will still be unset
tled and really in worse shape than at
present.
"The only way of testing the matter for
the benefit of the people generally is
through an action brought in their inter
est and over which they have control
"Now, as to the payment or non-pa v
ment of gas bills. let me say thN If
consumers refuse to litigate and continue
paying the $1 75 rate with the promised re
bate, depending upon others to make tin
test, there is little likelihood of there be
ing any refunding, if they let the mat
ter of litigation rest in the charge of in
dividuals, even if the latter are in the end
successful, the return of the excess will
be in the far distant future.
"I have found that many people have
refused to pay the $1 75 fate but have
made a tender of the amount of their bills
at the $1 10 rate, which has been refused
by the agents of the company. In no case
has the gas been shut off for a refusaJ to
pay. Taking into consideration the fact
that while a large number of parties are
not paying, many consumers who have no
desire to personally stand the brunt of
litigation are paying under protest at' the
$1 7j rate. The company is collecting in
this way and at this rate a larger sum
than it would receive were it to adopt
the $110 rate and be able to collect from'
all. Therefore the logical action to be
taken is for more consumers to refuse to
pay except it be the Jl 10 rate."
The remarks of Mr. Cupples were lis
tened to with deep Interest and when he
concluded the following resolution was
unanimously adopted:
"Resolved, That it, is the sense of the
Federation of Mission Improvement Clubs
that the $1 10 rate made for gas by the
Hoard of Supervisors is a just compensa
tion to the San Krancisco Gas and Elec
tric Company and we believe that th.'
courts will decide it to be the legal rate
and all that the gas company is entitled
to collect; and I- it further resolved, that
wp nree and recommend our members and
the members of the affiliated organiza
tions as well as the >gas consumers at
large', to nay their bills on that basis
only."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. May 20.â Barney Vail,
a dairyman of Rivera, has vanished. A
milk wagon and a team of horses disap
peared with him. Vail, who was a bach
elor, 45 years of age. sober and indus
trious, was employed by George H. Smith
of this city to drive a wagon to and from
a skimming station near Rivera. No rea
son is assigned for his disappearance, as
he is not known to have had enemies or
business troubles. He was last seen on
Monday afternoon. He flrove to this city
with a wagonload of milk and called to
see his employer, Smith, on a matter of
business. Late in the afternoon he got
into the wagon and started to return
home. A few minutes later he stopped
j at Heintzman's drugstore and purchased
!50 cents' worth of cotton-root bark. A
friend of his, Don Montgomery of Rivera,
had commissioned him to make the pur
! chase. Vail did not take the package, but
1 requested a clerk to mail it to Montgom
i cry. This is regarded as an indication.
j that Vail did not intend to return home.
After leaving the store Vail was not
i seen again. Persons along the Rivera
; road saw him driving fo town, but none
iof them saw him returning. That he had
! made no preparations to go away is made
i clear by his friends to-night, who say
that his clothing is at his home and that
1 he did not wear a coat when last seen.
i The friends that have been searching for
! Vail since Monday invoked the aid of the
i detectives to-night.
STEERING APPARATUS
WAS TAMPERED WITH
HONOLULU, May 13.â The army trans
port Warren had a narrow escape going
out of the harbor on the Ist inst. , and it
is due to Captain Macauley's skill and
carefulness that she got out in safety.
Some malicious person aboard the trans
port fastened the clutch that connects
the hand and steam steering apparatus,
so that the rudder could not respond to
the wheel.
The Warren cast off her lines at 5:30
k from the Oceanic wharf. Captain
Macauley was the ""Hot. He, swung her
around by her stem and bow lines until
she was in perfect position to move out
of the harbor. Then she started ahead.
When sh( s<ot to the point near the light
ly ruse where the turn is made into the
channel the vessel tailed to respond to
the wheel. Captain Macauley ordered the
engines reversed, and backed up. The ves
sel backed true and another start was
made. Again the vi Ssel railed to respond
to the wheel. Captain Macauley was now
convinced that something was wrong with
the steering gear and backed Into rood
position, and sent lines to the Pacific Mail
wharf to hold the vessel in position
while an examination was made. It was
then that the discovery was made that
the clutch had been disconnected. The
connection was made and a guard placed
over the clutch to prevent any more tam
pering with it. and then the vessel moved
out under perfect control.
While the steering- gear was disconnect
ed another untoward incident occurred,
not important in itself, but significant in
connection with the other. This was the
breaking of the telegraphic connection
between the bridge ami the engine room.
The speaking tube connection was. how
ever. Mill intact. .
The discovery of the trouble with the
steering gear in time found the vessel at
a point where it could be safely handled.
But had the discovery been delayed until
later, the most serious consequences
might have ensued. It is supposed the
motive of this tampering was to delay, the
departure, of the vessel. The belief >>n
shipboard was thai it was done not by
the soldiers, but by some of the ship's
crew.

POOR PEACE PROSPECT
IN THE PHILIPPINES
Special Cable to ThÂ» Call and th* New York
Kerala. Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Ocr
don Bennett. .
MANILA. May SO.â Members of
the Filipino Commission, with
credentials from Aguinaldo, are
in Manila, after a three days
trip from Victoria. They passed
through General Lawton's line at San
Isidro. and have been rushed by re
lays of horses and special train to Ma
nila. They are General Gregorio del
l'ilar, Colonel Alberto Barretto, Direct
or of Foreign Affairs: Major Lorenzo
C. Zialcita, aid to Aguinaldo, and Gra
cio Gonzaga, former Secretary of
State. They are to be joined by three
other members living In ManilaâFlor
entino Torres, Pablo Ocampo and Tea
doro Yangko, and will elect a president
and secretary.
Senor Gonzaga carries instructions
from AgMinaldo, which, he states if ac
ceded to by General Otis, empowers
them to conclude peace. Otherwise they
must return to their capital at Tarlac
for further conference. They will prob
ably ask for autonomy.
Members of the present commission
deny the story that Buencamino and
Arguelles, of the first commission, have
been arrested and the commission dis
solved by General Luna. They insist
that the first commission was never
recognized by Aguinaldo, but was elect
ed by the Filipino Congress, which de
clared in favor of peace on May 6. The
Filipino military power controls the sit
uation, not Congress.
The commissioners say they want
peace. They cannot light the Ameri
cans, who they say are destroying their
country. They express great surprise
at seeing thousands of native non-com
batants behind our lines.
The party was closeted with General
Otis for more than an hour, but the
interview was decidedly unsatisfactory,
the commission having nothing definite
to propose and not being empowered to
negotiate terms.
The communication from Aguinaldo
asked for an armistice pending the de
cision of the Filipino Congress as to
what policy should be adopted. As be
fore. General Otis refused to entertain
the propositions.
The commissioners after leaving the
City Hall accepted an invitation to
visit the Oregon and the other vessels
of the American fleet in the bay, and
they were also granted permission to
see their families before returning.
Major General Otis has declined to
recognize the rebels to the extent of
RUSSIA WILL BE
STUMBLING BLOCK
AT CONFERENCE
Blankly Rejects the Proposition
for Neutrality oif Private
Property at Sea,
THE HAGUE, May 20.â 1t cannot be,
now that the Peace Conference is '
fully organized, that the outlook for sue
as a result of its labors is encourag
ing. There had been an increasing hope j
since the delegates began to arrive early
in the week that substantial benefits to
Ihe human race would accrue from the
Czar's effort to perpetuate the blessings
of peace, but to-day this has given place
lv doubts stronger in certain quarters
than have been freely expressed ever
the rescript was issued.
It is necessary to avoid exaggerating the
Importance of the obstacle encountered,
' but the Anglo-Saxon delegates are seri
ously impressed with its significance.
It consists of Russia's refusal to con
sider such a civilizing amendment to the
of war as a proposal to neutralise
: all private property at sea in time of
war. This refusal is not official, but it
was made by Russia's official representa
tivea in the conference, and it was made
in such uncompromising terms that Eng
land, which proposed the matter, and
America and other nations, which would
be ;, r lad to discuss it. feel it is almost
hopeless to consider much more radical
proposals, which it was supposed the
conference had been summoned to act
upon.
The Russian side of the question is that
England will n fuse to agree to the Ctar's
set;, rue of disarmament, and has come to
the confi rence in the hope of carrying
, this single point, which would enable
'. â  I Britain to wage war without en
dangering her vast mercantile marine and
liei to concentrate her great naval
power against a weaker enemy. In other
words, the adoption of this proposal
would make British mastery of the seas
impregnable.
This Is probably true, and the Russian
opposition to the English proposal was
inevitable under the existing circuni
stances, bui this great obstacle which has
n before the conference has really
begun Its labors is a discouraging demon
stration of the difficulties in the way.
Russia's action has greatly surprised as
well as disappointed delegates having the
success of the conference at heart. It has
repeatedly declared that Russia has
no scheme to propose and no desire to
take the initiative or influence the scope
or plan of the conference, but when a
practical question arose she acted In a
manner scarcely less than dictatorial,
j The matter came to a crisis as follows:
It wa.l known that the English and Amer- J
lean delegates favored the foregoing pro- ,
;â¢â  sal for reducing the hardships of naval
warfare. Therefore, when Sir Ju
ilan Pauncefote suggested at yes
terday's ine-ting of the presidents
oi delegations that two commit- i
tees, naval and military, instead of
be appointed upon the laws of war, I
the suggestion was opposed by Russia
and other countries having a small mer
cantile marine.
The reason for the opposition, though
not then declared, was a desire to side
track the British prop,, sal, which would
have bc-en the principal subject for the
naval committee to consider. Later in the
: day the English delegates raised the point
directly in conversation with Russian col- ,
leagues and received the brusque Intima
tion that Russia would refuse even to
consider the subject. Naturally the effect
is that many delegates now do not hesi
tate to say if the initiator of the confer
once takes such an attitude thus' early It
is hardly worth while to take up more
difficult questions.
The revival of the suspicions of Russia's
bona fides is already having important ef
fects. Prominent delegates, Including
American, say Russia should have made
a substantial reduction of armament on
the eve of the conference as an earnest
of sincerity; otherwise it Is unreasonable
to expect that her neighbors should trust
fully accept and adopt her suggestions.
It had been proposed that Sir Julian
Pauncefote or Embassador White be
marie chairman of tho arbitration com- !
mittee, and one or the otTn;r would prob
ably have accepted with the understand
ing that an earnest effort will be made to j
arrive at h practical plan which it is
possible for all nations to adopt. Tester- :
day's rebuff, however, led to the declin
ation ol both gentlemen, and a rtuKstitn
or Hollander will be selected ;is i hnirtuan
Â! each committee. Professor Martins I
will be chairman of either Ihc diKurtna- I
meiit or arbitration committee.
All of the delegates are now Informed
of the characteristic declaration of the
Kaiser last week iii regard to arbitration
which was cabled yesterday, and a is
making an extraordinary senÃHtlon.
There IS also great dissatisfaction at
the Russian attempts to keep secrei the

The Filipino Commissioners

brought no definite proposals
for peace, the plea being still
for delay, and General Otis
has rejected the overtures
made. Peace in the Philip
pines, therefore, seems as far
off as ever.
agreeing to an armistice, but he has
notified the American commanders to
refrain temporarily from aggressive ac
tion. Thus he is in a position to re-
BUme hostilities at any time. This will
defeat any subterfuges to Rain time,
which would not be the case if the gen
â¢ml agreed to an armistice. The Fili
pinos are so deceptive that the people
hesitate to credit with good, faith their
last overtures. But more attention is
paid to them than was paid to their
previous advances. The Filipino Com
mission is acting under instructions
from Aguinalfio and the Congress, but
it Is possible that if peace is arranged
Generals Luna and Pio del Pllar and
their followers will continue a guerrilla
warfare.
At Iloilo an attack on the Americans
was recently expected. The Filipino
leader boasted that he had 2000 riflemen
and 10,000 bolo men and had the im
pudence to send an ultimatum to the
American commander, ordering him to
leave the island. As a result many of
the natives left the town, and for sev
eral days the outposts were doubled.
In addition, th*> Yorktown and the Iris
anchored in positions commanding the
mouth of the .Tara River, where the
attack was expected to take place, but
it failed to materialize.
Gable communication between Iloilo
and Bacolor, which has been inter
rupted, has been resumed.
CAMPAIGNS AGAINST
FILIPINOS NOT CHECKED
NEW YORK. May 20.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Distinct disappointment is
felt in administration circles at the
limited powers under which Aguinal
do's peace commission is acting. Gen
eral Otis' cablegram to-day announced
that Aguinaldn still desired an armis
tice, this time for the purpose of ascer
plies to Thursday 1 ? telegrams, and the
fact that the conference had met and di
vided into committees. Even the text
of President de Staals' platonic speech
upon peace was refused. It is unneces
sary to say the so-called secrets which
are Intrusted to 120 men are no secrets
at all, and Russian restrictions simply
ontail a little delay and extra work for
correspondents. Individual delegates nat
urally feel that they are under no obli
gations not to disclose the proceedings.
It Is argued with considerable force,
however, that committee work should not
be published In detail. All manner of
schemes will lip proposeÃ, and If there
should bo a world-wide discussion of them
through the press coincident with com
mittee debates and conflicting outside
pressure it would make it impossible for
the committees ever to agree on any
thing. As a matter of fact, each of the
three committees is So large as to com
prise more than a majority of the whole
conference, so that action in committee
is almost equivalent to action by the en
tire body.
The second sitting of the peace confer
ence took place this morning and lasted
thirty-five minutes. The president of the
conference, Baron de Staal. read the re
plies of the Czar and Queen Wilhelmina
to the telegx&ms sent them by the con
ference on Thursday.
The president then addressed the dele-
Rates on the subject of the labors before
them, and it was decided not to publish
the speech.
The proceedings to-day passed off with
out any incident. Only the president
spoke, the others manifesting their ap
probation by slight discreet murmurs.
CONFERENCE OF COAST
STUDENTS OPENED
PACIFIC GROVE, May 20.â The largest
body of students that has ever come to
: getber for a similar gathering assembled
In the Methodist church hero to-day to
formally open the fourth annual session
of the Pacific Coast Students' Conference.
Students from nearly every notable col
i lejfe In the Pacific Coast and Rocky
Mountain States are among the dele
gates, and although all have not yet ar
| rived over 100 men are now present. Di
| rector C. C. Mlchener opened the ses
] sion, after which the first department of
conference work â the missionary insti
\ tuteâ was opened by J. Rutter Wiliiam-
I son. M. D., of the University of Edin
burgh, who Is this year's international
secretary of the students' volunteer move
ment for work in profession at schools.
i Dr. Williamson talked of the general plan
| for carrying on the missionary work in
; colleges, outlining a subject which he will
take up sereatlm during the lectures of
the next ten days.
The second lecture of the morning, be
ginning the work of tho second depart
ment, was given by H. W. Rose of Ann
Arbor University, who Is a member of the
Students' International Committee and
assistant director of the conference. Mr.
Ilus'- diBCUBSÂ«d the way college associa
tions should carry on the work for new
students. He said this work pays the
largest dividends In the. way of satisfac
tory results of anything done during the
| college year.
At 10:ir> o'clock Tlenry T. McCoy of San
Francisco called the convention to order
to listen to an address by Rev. Dr. H. C.
Minton of the Presbyterian Theological
Seminary at San Anselmo. Dr. Minton
discussed a few of the questions that lie
In the background of the Bible.
A long tramp through Monterey, Del
Monte and the surrounding country side
enabled the students to vent some of their"
superabundant energy during the after
noon and prepare for the closing session
of the day at 7:30 p. m.. which was car
ried on by the delegates in discussing the
i reasons for the present conference.
STANFORD'S MUSICAL
CLUBS HOLD FORTH
I STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 20.â
I '1 li<Â« necessity of a new assembly hall was
in;i<Â«- apparent '.â¢to-night, when the com
b'.hÂ»'<'l musical' clubs save the commence
mi nt concert. "The doorways were
blocked, standing room was at a pre
mium and students were clinging to the
will. .stone lease outside: of the windows.'
The Ladles' Glee Club opened the. con
cert with "Sounds of the Western
Winds." Frank Branch- RUey, in mono
logue, was cleverer than usual, keeping
the house in a continual uproar. The la
test acquisition to Stanford's musical
world. "The Bughouse Quartet," made its
taining the desire of the Filipinos.
This will be rejected, and General Otis
is believed to have already rejected it.
Unconditional surrender will be re
quired, and General Otis "^rstands
this as well as the officials in Washing
ton. Just what is the object of the
meeting which the Filipino commission
will have with the American commis
sion on Monday is not known by of
ficials. General Otis being apparently
unaware of it, though he states that
"their powers are limited and appar
ently an armistice is a condition prece
dent to negotiations."
It is assumed that the emissaries of
the Insurgent leader desire to consider
with the commission the details of the
government which the United States
proposes to give them, and which the
American commissioners presented to
Colonel Arguelles, the first Filipino
representative to put in an appearance
at Manila. When this meeting is con
cluded, it is presumed, the commission
ers will return to the new capital which
Aguinaldo has established and commu
nicate the results of its conference.
In view of the apparent hopelessness
of definite results from the present
conference, it is the expectation of the
authorities that General Otis will direct
Generals I-awton and Mac Arthur and
Major Kobbe to continue their opera
tions with a view to preventing the in
surgents from obtaining time in which
to reorganize their scattered army. The
authorities have learned well the lesson
that delay gives the Filipinos the idea
that the Americans are beaten, and it is
believed that the quickest way to bring
them to terms is to continue the cam
paigns now in progress.

CHURCH OF ENGLAND
IN GRAVE DANGER
NEW YORK. May 20.â A cable to the
Journal from London says: Dean Farrar
of Canterbury. tht> most popular divine
in the English church, made an extraor-
dinary statement to the Journal cor
respondent yesterday on the critical po
sition of the church of Kngland. lie Bald:
"The English church is passing through
the tire of controversy and dissension,
and a deep division is being produced.
There is no distinct mode of knowing
where we are. 'A house divided' was never
truer in its application that when ap
plied to the Church of Kngland to-day.
"A church in two sections is always
undesirable and productive of harmâ a
church with two such extreme parties as
constitute the English church at this mo
ment in its struggle lor life or death. God
only knows whether the church will be
permanently crippled.
"As far as I can see. unless the extreme
party â and by that I mean those who are
practicing a distinctly Romish ritualâre
linquish their practices the Inevitable
end must be disestablishment or disrup
tion.
"The prayer hook is by all conscience
liberal in its srupo, but "when a certain
section follows Rome in worship in all but
recognition of the infallibility of the Pope
there is surely just ground for complaint.
The ritualistic party must be prepared to
make concessions before the English
church can again be united."
INFORMAL HOME RULE
FOR THE EMERALD ISLE
NEW YORK. May 20.-A cable to the
Times from London says: An experiment
of extreme Interest, nothing less than in
formal home rule, is to be tried in Ire
land. It is the outcome of a letter ad
dressed by Kir Thomas Esmonde some
time ago to the chairman of each of the
new Irish County Councils inviting them
to form a national council to consider
â¢ 'â¢oTiomic and practical questions of com
mon importance to all. Each Council will
send three delegates.
Among the subjects to be discussed will
be a poor law, the public health, the
housing- of the poor, agriculture, roads,
railways and linancial relations with
Great Britain.
The Council will, of course, have no of
ficial status or constitutional power, but
if it works soberly and harmoniously its
results cannot fail to carry the greatest
weight, thus constituting a sort of in
formal home rule. It is a wise and patri
otic, step, pregnant with great possibili
ties for Ireland's future.

NEW YORK. May 20.â A Journal cable

THE PLAN
FOR PEACE
NOT NEW
It Has Been Attempted Be
fore in Europe on Two
Occasions.
NAPOLEON 111 FIRST
Efforts for Disarmament in 1863
and 1870 Met With Decided
Failure.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, ISM. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, May 20.â The Czar's disarm
ament proposal is by no means the new
factor in European politics it is popu
larly supposed to be. Something of a
similar nature was on two occasions at
tempted by Napoleon 111. though in
these cases the idea. was not general be
yond the realm of diplomacy. Accord
ing to the Temps, in 1563 Napoleon
thought he bring about perpetual
peace by rearranging the map of Eu
rope in a manner satisfactory to all
nations and all great powersâ ltaly,
which had not yet taken Venice or
Rome, excepted. She thought there was
too much to lose by this scheme, and
declined to have anything to do with it.
Another disarmament proposition
was made at the beginning of IS7O, and
In this case the disarmament was to be
of a restricted character. Overtures
were made by Napoleon to the Prussian
Government, through the intermediary
of the British Government, but it may
be said that it was not possible for
Prussia to entertain the idea of dis
! cussing the two efforts of Napoleon 111
i In favor of disarmament.
The Temps s;iys the lesson taught by
the first is that the territorial question
is always a stumbling block, and that
the second system â that of restricted
disarmamentsâ seems to offer mon pos
| sibilities of success. But, the Temps
j concludes, real progress is only to be
found in extending strong International
arbitration.

ADVERTISEMEU TS.
CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant. Simp'e but Snfi and ES-
feetu I Cure lo? It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or bloat-
ing sensation after eating, accompanied
with sour or watery iisings, a formation
of gases causing a pressure on the heart
and lungs, and difficult breathing; head-
aches, fickle appetite, nervousness and a'
generally played out, ianguid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the mouth,
coated tongue, and if the interior of the
stomach could be seen it would show a
slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and obstinate
trouble is found in a treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment
and irritate the delicate mucous surface
of the stomach. To secure prompt and
healthy digestion is the one necessary
thing to do and when normal digestion
is secured the catarrhal condition will
have disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and best treatment Is to use after each
meal a tablet composed of Diastase,
Aseptic, Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden Seal
and fruit acids. These tablets can now
be found at all drug stores under the
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and
not belnp; a patent medicine can be used
with perfect safety and assurance that
healthy appetite will follow their regular
use after meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher, of 27.10 Dearborn St.,
Chicago, 111., says: "Catarrh is a local
condition resulting from a neglected cold
In the head, whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the poi-
sonous discharge therefrom passing back-
ward into the throat reaches the stomach,
thus producing catarrh of the stomach.
Medical authorities prescribed for me for
three years for catarrh of the stomach
without cure, but to-day I am the hap-
piest of men after using only one box of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I cannot find
appropriate words to express my good
feeling. I have flesh, appetite and sound
rest from their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest
as well as the simplest and most conven-
ient remedy for any form of indigestion,
catarrh of the stomach, biliousness, sour
stomach, heartburn and bloating after
meals.
Send for little book, mailed free, on
stomach troubles, by addressing F. A.

can be found at all drug stores.
LASH LAID
ON BACKS OF
PRISONERS
Culprits Severely Whipped
in the Presence of a
Big Crowd.
FIFTEEN GET FLOGGED
Sheriff Taylor Wields the Cat-of-
Nine-Tails in a Delaware
Jail Yard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 20.â A Wilmington,
Del., special to the Herald says: Fif
teen culprits were publicly whipped in
the New Castle jail yard to-day with
cat-o'-nine-tails. Fully 100 spectators,
some interested in the study of crimin
ology, watched the men squirm and
wriggle through the ordeal. In the
gathering were numerous women, who
gazed without a tremor at the unfortu
nate men whose backs were being
honeycombed with bright red welts as
the rawhido struck the bare skin.
Sheriff Taylor wielded the "cat," and
the number flogged is the greatest in
any one day of recent years. It took ex
actly twenty-eigv minutes to chastise
the men, and then they were conduct
ed back to their cells to serve sen
tences for petty larceny and other tri
vial offenses. Hilton's â¢ companion,
Henry Harding, dreaded the whipping.
"Lightly. Sheriff," he pleaded, and he
was secured to a post. He squirmed
and twisted and stood sideways as
twenty blows were laid on. He seemed
to be tortured, although his punish
ment was light. John Green, who re
ceived fifteen lashes, grinned and
winked at the spectators during his
chastisement, but Harry Hall was so
nervous when his twenty strokes were
finished that he could hardly walk from
the post. Wesley Brown twisted about
the whipping post like a snake to evade
the stinging rawhide, but he was un
successful.
The buck of each man was crossed
with streaks and raised welts after he
had been whipped. But no blood was
drawn. All seemed to dread the dis
grace of being whipped in public. It is
noteworthy that none of the prisoners
lloggpd to-day had ever before huereed
the whipping post. Among the SDeeta
| tors were prison officials from Phila
delphia and from ponal institutions
throughout Pennsylvania. They fol
lowed every movement of the Sheriff,
and were impressed with the demeanor
of thf culprits after being released
from the whipping post.

ONE BLANTHER
FROM POISON
Suicide of Etta Crawford,
Who Was the Wife of
the Murderer.
CONFESSION FORGED
Before Her Death the Woman De
clared That Her Husband Did
Not Kill Minnie Williams.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., May 20.â Ettle
Crawford, an inmate of a disreputable
house, committed suicide here to-day
by swallowing carbolic acid. This
woman was the wife of Blanther, who,
it was claimed by Theodore Durrant's
attorneys, wrote a confession of the
murder of Minnie Williams in San
Francisco several years ago. Blanther
committed suicide while in jail at
Meridian, Tex., and a strong effort was
made to save Durrant on the strength
of his alleged confession. His wife
finally drifted to this city. Before her
death she declared with emphasis that
the alleged confession of her husband
was a forgery.
Blanther, when the story of his life
comes to be written, had two wives, and
which one this is is not made clear.
Blanther's career was a remarkable one.
Born In lSr>9 at Radkersburg, in Styruer.
Lower Austria, he gTew up an honored
man and a soldier of distinction. In turn
he served as an officer under Archduke.
Ludwtg Victor arid in the Thirty-second
Austrian Infantry. He was decorated for
gallant services with the war medal.
Knight of the Italian Crown, order of the
third class and order of the iron crown.
He deserted from the Eighty-fifth Hun
garian Infantry in ISSS and went to Slam.
He came to the United States in the same
year and entered the employ of Rand,
McNally & Co. of Chicago. At that time
he passed as a married man. In 1890,
after failing in business, he went to Can
ada, and later was heard from in Arkan
sas, where he had married, under the
name of Arthur Forbes. Miss Agnes Cam
eron. Under that name ho started In
business in Atlanta. Ga., where he de
serted his wife in IS%, coming to San
Francisco.
Blanther's murder of Mrs. Philopena
Langfeldt in this city on May 5. IS%, his
flight and subsequent arrest and sulcido
In Texas are well known. Before he took
his life he was reported to have made a
confession of the murder of Minnie Wil
liams, for which crime Theodore Durrant
paid the penalty on the gallows.

HONOLULU, May 13.â Wahiawa, on

that the established Kleele plantation,

OH, BELLE HOWARD
LANDED IN JAIL
Captured After a Long
Chase.
Special Dispatch to The Cali.
TACOMA, May 20.â Sheriff Van de
Vanter of King County last night
placed in jail Dr. Belle Howard and '
George Howard, her husband, wanted
at Peoria, 111. where indictments ;ire !
out against them as principal and ac- !
cessory in the murder of Miss Ilush
retta Binkley, a beautiful young woman
of prominent family, by means of a
criminal operation. Another indict- j
ment is out against the woman for a '
criminal operation on Blanch*; Barn
hart.
The doctor disappeared from Peoria j
in April, 1898, Immediately after the
; death of Miss Binkley, and detectives '
| all over the country have been looking
for her. Five hundred dollars reward
was offered for her apprehension.
Sheriff Van de Vanter, after some
correspondence with Sheriff J. W. Kin- j
sey of Peoria, became convinced that :
the woman was in Tacoma or Seattle \
and began looking for her. One clew
after another failed, until a woman an- j
Bwering Mrs. Howard's description was â¢
taken into custody in Tacoma early :
this week. This woman was Mrs. Mar
shall, who soon convinced the officers
that she was not Dr. Howard.
This defeat was discouraging, but
failure was suddenly turned into sue- !
cess by a revelation on Mrs. Marshall's
part that *he knew Mrs. Howard well.
Mrs. Marshall was watched until she
boarded a steamer here .for Olympia.
It was then learned that Mrs. Marsn ill
had recently purchased a small farm j
two miles from Olympia, presumably
for the Howards.
Sheriff Van de Vanter engaged the
fastest team in Tacoma and made a
terrific race across country to Olympia
in order to reach there before the
steamer bearing Mrs. Marshal!. He won
the race by a few minutes and took
Dr. Howard into custody.
Mr. Howard had learned that the
Sheriff was looking for him and fled,
but was caught, at Bucoda by Deputy
Sheriff Wilson as he was trying to es
cape on a freight train. Howard de
clares he knows nothing of the Bink
| ley case. He says he was tried for com
plicity in the Barnhart case, but the
j jury disagreed and he was let go on
I $1000 bonds. That was nine months ago,
since which time he has been traveling
about the country, coming here two
â ks ago.
Dr. Howard is an intelligent woman
of 50 years. Her former husband. Mr.
Shotwell, diÂ£d some years ago and she
married George Howard, a prominent
business man of Peoria.
In January, 1808, Blanche Barnhart, a
young woman of good social standing,
was the central figure in a Peoria scan
dal in which it was charged Dr. Howard
( had performed a criminal operation. On
! April 3 the second cloud came up when
Miss Binkley died, and Dr. Howard
j fled. Her husband remained, stood trial
on the Barnhart case and then de
parted. Both have since been searched
for In St. Louis, Minneapolis and many
other cities.
Governor Tanner of Illinois wired to
day that he has dispatched an officer
with extradition papers for Tacoma.
Dr. and Mrs. Howard admit their iden
tity and offer to return without requisi
tion papers. Where Sheriff Van de Van
ter has jailed them is unknown, his ob
ject being apparently to prevent any
attempt to Institute habeas corpus pro
| ceedings.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 21, 1899.
GENERAL AMES
SCORES SHAFTER
Says He Remained on
Shipboard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, May 20.â Brigadier General
Adelbert Ames said to-day:
"General Shafter'.s commendation of
the conduct of his army under fire is
a little unkind to his generals, while
on the other hand he is the target for
the harshest criticisms and insinua
tions. It appears by the official records
and other writings, made too prominent
to escape notice, that he was on board
his ship on the 24th, when the battle of
Las Guasimas was fought, that he re
mained there till the 30th, six days
later, and only assumed command on
Bhore on July 1, the day of the last
battle.
"In explanation of his tenacity in
holding to his ship he says: "If a storm
bad come up all would have been gone.'
He falls to make any statement by
which one can understand just what he
meant by such 'goneness.' It has been
Bald, sturm or no storm, his place was
en shore with his army. It also ap
pears by official reports that during the
fighting of the last- day he kept to his
tent, three miles from El Caney and
two and a half miles from Fort San
Juan hill. Officers of the force which
carried the hill have stated to me that
Santiago could have been captured that
first day of July had our forces fol
lowed sharply under efficient leader
ship the Seeing and demoralized Span
iards. Two and a half miles in the rear
of the fighting line is too far away for
efficient 'leadership in such a country
and with so small a force. That he
was informed of the position of our
lines is made evident by his report that
he climbed El Poso hill and saw our
tine a mile and a half away on Fort
San Juan hill. That night he held a
council of war to consider the with
drawal of our forces from the position
they had captured and occupied during
the day.
"The round-robin was not initiated
by the officers who signed it. It came
Into existence at the request of the
nanuing general. So far as the
signers were concerned they exported
and intended that their action would
tx enveloped in the same secrecy which
properly belongs to such a council.
They thought this paper would pass to
their superior and from him to Wash
ington in the usual way. It was not
for them to give publicity to it."
HAWAIIAN ATTORNEY

HONOLULU, May 13.â A. S. Humph

GERMAN BILLS
TO BE PASSED
Only Minor Measures on
the List.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, May 20.â The Reichstag has
adjourned for the holidays and will re
assemble on June 6, when it is the in
tention to pass the following bills: In
valid insurance for postal employes,
which will abolish a score of private
postal institutions; the Gerverbe-Ord
nung law, regulating the number of
trades, and an additional appropriation
bill. The leaders of the different parties
have agreed to pass these measures and
leave the judiciary and other bills, in
cluding the meat inspection, until the
autumn.
It has decided to divide the persons
entitled to invalid insurance into five
classes, at from 350 to 1150 marks an
nually.
The rejection of the Midland canal
bill by the committee is much com
mented upon In the press. From inside
information the correspondent of the
Associated Press learns that this does
not mean the defeat of the bill. In a
plenary session of the Diet Kmperor
"William intends to use his personal in
fluence to secure the support of the
entire Left and Center party of the
Reichspartie and some of the Conserv
atives, whose votes would give the bill
a clear majority. The Government is
determined that the measure, which is
! the result of twenty years" deliberation,
shall not wait, it being claimed that
such a canal scheme is imperatively
needed, in view of the fact that the
State railroads are about to come to an
end of their carrying capacity. The
Conservative plan of constructing a
â  system of subsidiary railroads will not
jbe adopted. The main reason that the
Government, and particularly- the Em
peror, so strongly favors the canal pro
ject is that in case of war with France
or Russia, or both, a network of canals
from the eastern to the western fron
tier of Prussia would afford the best
Bystern for the conveyance of field hos
pitals and supplies for the ordnance de
partment.
I The agricultural depression was
heatedly discussed in the Diet this
week, and much interesting matter was
brought to light. The lack of rural
labor for the large estates in the east
ern provinces was thoroughly venti
lated. Baron yon Wanheim, president
of the Federation of Husbandry, said
that unless a radical change was
wrought more than half the holders of
their estates would be ruined within
five years as it was impossible to ob
tain the necessary number of hands in
harvest time, â  even at higher wages
than formerly. The influx of Polish
and Russian laborers during the har
vest is wholly insufficient and for na
tional and race reasons is not favored
by the Government. The latter an
nounced that li), 000,000 marks would be
spent in settling small owners in the
districts most affected.
The press and the Government are
much interested in the so-called anti
jingo movement started by German-
Americans in the United States. Fred
erick Holls, secretary of the United
States delegation at the peace confer
ence at The Hague, while here
thoroughly informed the Minister of
Foeign Affairs, Baron yon Bulow, and
the Foreign Office officials as to the ex
tent and purport of the movement. He
carried assurances from Washington
that so far as the movement meant the
preservation of good intimate relations
between the two countries, the ad
ministration is thoroughly in accord
with it.
The German press freely comments
with satisfaction on the fact that Ger
man-Americans have exerted them
i selves toward the re-establishment of
.the former pleasant international rela
tions.
The J. D. Peters in Service.
STOCKTON. May 20.â The J. D. Peters
left to-night for San Francisco. The
Peters will hardly be recognized as the
boat which sank off Angel Island four
months ago. Everything in the way of
machinery is new, from the boilers up.
The staterooms and cabins are refill*
nished and the painters were given a lib
eral opportunity to show what they could
do. The Peters is one of the best boats
belonging to the California .Navigation
Company, and will at once resume her
old run. The steamer was billed to leave
the local dock last evening, but some un
expected work in the engine-room held
her over for twenty-four hours.
Lyon Succeeds Morrison.
| SAN JOSE, May 20.â Ernest P. Lion was
to-day appointed Police and Fire Com
missioner by Mayor Martin, to fill the
vacancy caused by the resignation of
Thomas F. Morrison. Mr. Lion is a mem
ber or" the L. Lions & Sons Company,
carpet dealers. He Is popular among the
young business men, and the appointment
gives satisfaction. Morrison tendered his
resignation because he now fills the office
of County Auditor.

Views of Noted Officers
on Recent War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters. Wellington Hotel,
Washington, May 20.
Much curiosity has naturally been man
ifested by naval men in this country as
to the manner in which Brassey's Annual
would treat the Spanish-American war,
and the volume, copies of which have
just reached here, is not disappointing in
this respect, as Colonel Sir George Clarke
has a chapter of fifty-two pages and sev
eral maps reviewing it. The whole story
is practically a condensation of official re
ports, with comments giving due credit
without fulsome praise, and closing with
deductions and lessons drawn from re
sults. Of the battle of Manila the re
viewer says:
"The absolute failure of the Spanish
coast batteries at Cavite, as elsewhere
during the war, is amply explained by
the want of training of the gunners, com
bined with technical deficiencies of every
kind. While the action in Manila Bay
was thus a foregone conclusion, convey
ing only lessons of an obvious character,
Commodore Dewey's proceedings on May
1 merit the highest commendation."
Of the running fight off Santiago on
July 3 Sir George Clarke says: "During
this part of the action the most signifi
cant feature ia the eagerness of all the
American captains to press on so long
as any Spanish ships remained undis
abled. Thus the performance of the Ore
gon, which passed the Texas and the
lowa and took up the chase of the Colon
at sixteen knots, is remarkable. The ef
fect of her long voyage in securing full
steaming efficiency was clearly shown.
The experience gained by the engineers
and stokers was strikingly asserted, and
the moral is indisputable."
Lieutenant Beehler, D. S. N., contrib
utes a chapter on the United States navy
and private shipbuilding yards. Cramp's
yard is claimed to be "the leading estab
lishment of the country." followed by the
I'nion Iron Works and the Newport News
Company, which latter the writer as
serts "is one of the largest and best
equipped in the world.''
In a tabulated comparison of the fire
energy per minute of the latest battle
ships the new Maine is last in efficiency
of eight battleships of the British,
French, Italian, German, Russian and
Japanese navies. The German battleship
Kaiser Frlederich 111 of 10,954 tons is cred
ited with 576,588 foot tons of gun fire, or
."i2.b4 per ton displacement; while the
Maine of 12,500 tons shows an energy of
only 375.D72 foot tons, or 22.32 per ton dis
placement. The British, Italian and Jap
anese battleships have a high efficiency
in heavy gun fire, much greater than the
Maine.
In the usual tables of ships of the sev
eral navies that of Spain still contains
the names of the armored cruisers and
other ships lost or destroyed at Santiago
and Manila, and although foot notes ex
plain the fate of each ship there would
seem to be no good reason for filling up
v table with vessels that have ceased to
exist. Some of the captured Spanish ves
sels are duly placed in the list ef United
States naval vessels.
A brief but interesting description js
given of the two torpedo boats building
by Parsons at Newcastle-on-Tyne. They
are 320 tons displacement and with tur
bine motors developing 12,000 horsepower
are expected to make thirty-five knots.
. Their machinery, boners etc., weigh lbO
tons against 144 tons weight of the mo
tive power for the torpedo boat destroyers
of 3tW tons now building, and which de
velop only 6000 horsepower and a speed of
thirty knots.

MURDER ATTEMPTED
BY A JEALOUS WIFE
One San Jose Woman Attacks An
other With a Hatchet, Inflicting
a Serious Wound.
SAX JOSE, May 20.â A quarrel ovrr thp
affections of a husband nearly ended In
murder to-day. Mrs. F. E. Garvey ia
suffering from a hatchet wound on the
head and Mrs. Schoenamann was sent to
the County Jail in default of $1000 bonds
to await her preliminary examination for
assault to murder. Mrs. Garvey reside?
at 1022 South Tenth street, while her as
sailant lives on Eleventh street. For
some time there has been an estrangi -
ment between the women on account of
the jealousy of Mrs. Schoenamann. She
alleges that her husband devotes more
attention than ho ought to Mrs. Garvey.
This morning Mrs. Schoenamann decid
ed to secure an equal division of- her hus
band's love. Grabbing a hatchet, she
started out- to find her husband at Mr?.
Garvey's. fully determined to "toma
hawk" him. fie was not there, however,
and she attacked Mrs. Garvey. She
struck the latter on the head with the
hatchet, producing a serious scalp wound.
Garvey interfered and undoubtedly pre
vented murder.
Mrs. Schoenamann was arraigned be
fore Justice Gass on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon, preferred by Mrs.
Garvey. Her examination was set for
June 24 at 10 o'clock.

The Government he : - the
question "i discrimination in the not over
half proposition affecting Japanese A
year ago when the treaty between Hawaii
and Japan was in force such a step could
not be thought of for a moment. Now,
however, it is different.
It is not a fait, as might he inferred
from reports in some of the papers, that
there- is air.' B< rious disagreement between
the Government and planters on the mat
ter of curtailing the use of Japanese la
bor. Most of the sugar planters are united
in the "opinion that the character of Ha
waiian labor should and must be changed
iekly as possible. Said a man who
represents a dozen plantations:
â \\.- agree thoroughly with the Govern
meni that there mu.=t be a change, and
will do all in our power to bring it about
an as possible. ( >f course, ;* Budden

SENIORS BEATEN
BY THE FACULTY
Exciting Baseball Game
at Stanford.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD, May ~ 20. â The faculty
members are in high glee and are con
gratulating themselves on their victory
over the seniors in the baseball game to
day. Heretofore the faculty team al
ways has been beaten, and badly at that.
This year the team was strengthened by
some young blood, and it won by the
close score of 12 to 11.
Dr. Jordan appeared on first bas<\ and
wore a sunny smile as he accepted chance,
after chance arid saw his team, fighting
an uphill game, gradually overtake and
pass its opponents. The doctor says he
started in playing ball away back in the
'70's, when "Pop" Anson of the Chicago
White Stockings did, and he guessed he
could stay with It as long as that worthy.
Dr. Jordan confines himself to one game
a yar. however, never getting out to
practice with his team. How he happened
to be in such good condition to-day is a
subject for speculation. It has been re
ported by some that the doctor has been

This great sale of ours answers two purposes â helps us get rid of our surplus of $15,
$16-50 and $17.50 sack suits and advertises us as only good, honest, unusual bargains can.
Remember these suits are not flimsy, light weights, filling a temporary need only, but are
a!i-ihe-year-rnund weights*
Solid all-wool 18 and 20 ounce cassimeres and cheviots â suits made so strongly that
they will stand all kinds of hard knocks and come up smilingly â suits that are made,
trimmed and fashioned so perfectly that they are the counterpart, or even a little better,
than the merchant tailor sorts at $20 or $25 â suits that are guaranteed absolutely to be
big plump values at $15, $16.50 and $17.50. These are the sort of suits we are selling
until further notice at $9.45. Be wise. Don't lose this opportunity. To look or examine
costs nothing.
going out into the arboretum by himself
to train, and that he has been seen, when
he supposed he was not, juggling stuffed
fisht a in the laboratories. However this
may be, the victory was due to a great
extent to his playing. He hit safely sev
eral times and at the right time. His
assistant, "Billy" Erb, was kept busy
cantering around the bagsâ the doctor
never runs bases.
The most amusing feature of the game
was the wearing apparel of the seniors.
On a dark night of last week they hied
themselves to the city in a bunch, and
when they came back each had under his
arm a fancy ballet costum?. The manager
would not say where these came from,
and there has been much conjecture as
to whether they were hired from the cho
rus girls of some city opera company.
When the senior players stood up in a
row to be phoiographed the sight was
one to "make the angels weep."

generosity of Claus Spreckels AptCM WtU

commodious district school houses In th<
county. The present building is hardly
fit for occupancy and the new building

to C. D. Folsom, a local contractor. The
latter heard last May that Mr. Spreckels
intended to donate to Aptos a school -
house and Immediately communicated
with the capitalist. In due time he com
pleted arrangements, and later had in
hand the plans drawn by Reid Bros.
The schoolhouse itself will cost $2000,
and the contract price will foot up close
to $3000. Included with the donation goe3
one acre of land, situated just this side of

RAILROAD STRATEGY.
THE Southern Pacific Company entered the Cir
cuit Court of the United States on, Friday last
without notice to the Attorney General of the
State or to Messrs. Foot* and Hayne. the special
who have represented the Railroad Comrais
otion dismissed the grain-rate
case. There was no pos tion to the mo
when presented on behalf of the railroad itself,
mdc, in which large pub
re involved, it would have been in ac
with usage for the courtesy of a notice to
[ n that c wever, the Attorney
'â¢ - - Hayne and Foote, possibly all
: :, n , ; , present, and the reporters
have been there. It was more con
ic with railroad methods, for the un
expected to happen, and for on- of its strategic points
to be made and one of its gross frauds consummated,
when immediate comment or the suggestion of awk
ward <â¢ â¢ â  â as impossible.
The pul li bserve that a litigation corn
ed by the railr I in whicft the State
fully forty-three thousand dollars, has ended
without the settlement of any issue it embraced and
aver it had accomplished its only real purpose, so far
complainant was concerned. It will be noted.
that this result would not have been attained
except through dishonest collusion with the majority
seni Railroad Commission, Messrs. Btack
. and Laumeister. The exact facts should be
lected that the full measure of responsibility may
be ex.i
The Railroad Commission in 1895, consisting of
Hugh M. La Rue. James I. Stanton and William R.

juncti n both sides evinced a determination to
bring the controversy in all it- phases to a definite
lit. The vi .pinion throng;
the Stai - 1, throug u1 the Union â was
met the claims
tiers and that the decision
in its suit would permanently adjust its relation- with
the public.
Judge McKenna avoided t'i me of
the larerr-r points, reserving th< m for the final hear
and simply gr; I nporary injunction rc
of the grain-rate schedule.
A mosi elaborate ahd complete answer to the bill of
complaint was filed, signed by the Attorney General
â  â  and by Robert Y. Hayne and W. \V.
- as counsel for the- Commissioners. After the
hearing of exceptions and other dilatory proceedings
the issues to be decided were settled. Under the
equity practice, the testimony had to be taken in the
form â  . and some idea of the magni
tude of the work done in the production of the pr<
may be derived from the fact that the evidence â 
introduced covers 2864 type-written ;
625 ar< the direct and cross examinations of
C. P. Huntingti â¢â 
After a lapse of nearly three years, when the po
litical contest of 1898 commenced in this State, the
controversy was almost ready for trial, and not
a whisper had been heard to the effect that the n
road had been playing with the Com"
iving both them and the people. But the lir
cumstances had altered and the - â¢<rn Pa- 1
ciiic Company dare not meet the struggle it had
tely invited. I*- relation to the Central Pat ific
Railroad Company it had to satisfy its stockholders
and its bondholders, and it was â â  forced to pro
to the
eral <. I a continu of iti imposi 1 :
upon trade,' o 1 rce, manufacture and all the otliT
industrial elements of a commonwealth rapidly tak
ing a foremost rank in the Union. Among other
facts shown by the evidence was that its estimate of
railroad property for the purposes of taxation in
round numbers was about one half of i'> estimate for |
;tablishmenl of "just and reasonable" rates. For
tii^ latter obj< tnent was a little more
than $41,01 â¢ ile and H was evident cither that;
: contributing it 1 - fair proportion of taxes or j
thai '1 was literally plundering its unwilling cus-
Here was matter for the consideration of
the State Board of Equalization. But all the other
vita] points on which at the time its suit was instituted
the railroad was not only willing but anxious to ac
cept the judgment of a conn of chancery were in an
equally satisfactory condition for the trial which" the
public expected and which had been substantially
guaranteed.
With its usual disregard for consistency, its usual
indifference to the public interest? and its usual prac
tice oi extortion and oppression, the railroad now de
vised a scheme to have the suit dismissed, which in
the form it adopted would have been successful but
for the integrity and the firmness of Judge Morrow.
While "out of politics" it committed an atrocious
fraud upon the Republican party and secured two of
the Railroad Commissioners, It then manipulated
the Legislature to prevent the requisite appropriation
for the remaining labor to be done on behalf of the
public. When the plan hnd been thus far carried out
Commissioners Blackstock and Laumeister, in con
formity with the famous report polished into com
pleteness by William F. Herrin, rescinded the reso
lutions of 1895, unexecuted as to the horizontal re
duction and perfected as to the grain rates, and in
, structed Attorney General Ford to make the motion
1 for dismissal which Judge Morrow denied. At that
THE SAN FT? A IS J CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 21, 1899.
,1
time, as on Friday last, the railroad was represented I
by E. S. Pillsbury, who then declined the- suggestion j
of Judge .Morrow to adopt the motion with the re- |
mark, "Well, we don't know to what penalties\that
might subject us."
The railroad game to obliterate the litigation j
through the commission in. mere form was blocked.
But it was so essential to avoid a hearing on the
merits in the Circuit Court that, when all other means
had failed, it swallowed its declarations of years and,
through its own. attorney, forced a discontinuance. It j
placed its application, however, on the extinction of
the controversy through the repealing action of its
two. representatives on the Railroad Confmission. and
magnanimously concluded to bear the loss of the
money it had expended, which, so far as disclosed, had
been fully counterbalanced by the loss the State had
suffered through the treachery and fraud to which it
hai 1 been subjected. . â 
. ...It thus appears that in order to obtain a judicial
determination of fundamental propositions in con- J
troversy between the railroad and the State a new
litigation will be essential. But it is suggested that
Attorney General Ford, of whose good faith
so far no doubt has been entertained, promptly in
vestigate the responsibility of the railroad and its
agents and employes under the constitutional pro- |
vision to which The Call has already referred, and that j
the State â¢ Board of Equalization -examine the filed j
depositions so that the railroad assessments may be |
raised and the two aspects in which, for opposite pur
poses, it presents its property values harmonized.
The shameless conduct which the railroad considers
a triumph over the people may yet turn out to be a
booemrang if State officers, other than Commissioners
Blackstock and Laumeister. do their â¢ duty. From |
these Commissioners of course nothing can be an
ticipated, although, with the railroad consent, they j
may undertake a pretended revision of the rate \
schedules that will give no relief whatever and con- j
stitute merely "a sop to Cerberus."
THE PEACE CONFERENCE.
THE reports from The Hague are not reassuring
to those who hoped that the Czar's conference
would result in the decrease of armaments and
the lifting from the people of the burden of great
armies and navies.
The modern nations have been too much indoc
trinate', by Lord Salisbury's conscience-quieting doc
trine of "dying nations," upon whose estates the
strong and vital nations have a right to administer.
and by Kipling's 'White Man's Burden," which is the
death, knell of the weak and defenseless, to abate their
military establishments and mind their own business \
Alien so much loot is in sight If they could agree,
peacefully, upon which should administer upon each
nation that the whole decide to be moribund, and
which -hould go jocund to the task of exterminating
the weak and friendless, the matter would be simpli
fied, and'armaments might be reduced to the scale re
quired in hastening the death of the dying and in the
slaughter of the weak. Rut the trouble is the impos
sibility of such an agreement. Take the descent upon
China as an example. That great empire offers a
richer spoil than Caesar found in Gaul or England in
India. Kven the United States have been invited to
take some of it. Ail the limitations of international
law are suspended at the borders of that country.
Its immediate partition is not delayed by any regard
!'>r the rights of its people, but only by disputes
among the nations now in peace conference as to
which shall get the best pieces. Already American
statesmen have declared that we must have our rights
in the division of China. Just what rights we, or
the other western nations, have to property that
morally and by international law belongs to another, j
no one has undertaken to define. China has waged
war on none of them, but has stayed at home and
minded her own business. Yet the forcible over
throw "f her Government and the partition of her
are planned and the western nations are armed
i" tight it out with each other and throw cannon
shot like dice for property to which they have no j
legal nor moral claim.
So the disarmament phase of the Peace Conference !
i; not likely to get much consideration. But there is
,-> branch of the question, already suggested by Sir
Julian Pauncefote, the representative of Great Britain.
This goes to an agreement to mitigate the horrors of
war by defining clearly what shall be considered an
'â¢ of war against an enemy. Formerly, in naval
warfare, many acts were permitted which now by in
ternational agreement are forbidden as piracy. This
was a great and humane step out of the unrestrained
cruelties of the past. Recent events have made it
necessary to take a similar step in regard to military
carnage on land. Slaughter of the wounded, killing
prisoners, using fire primarily as an agent of destruc
tion of human life, bombarding unfortified cities, i
shelling coasts and the shores of streams inhabited by
deh useless natives, resulting in the wholesale murder
omen and children, are all used as the means of
spreading terror and compelling a surrender of all
other rights as the price of the right to live.
The Peace Conference is between so-called Chris
tian nations, all of which send mi>sionaries to the
heathen, and whose Christian sects proselyte amorig
themselves, each regarding itself as the special custo
dian of the truths of Christianity and a promoter of !
the principle of peace on earth and good will toward
men. Their general professions of Christianity will
deserve more credit if they will follow what seems to ;
be the initial trend of sentiment in the conference, and
agree to do their killing of each other and of others
who, being defenseless and therefore most in need of
peace, are allowed no representatives in the Peace
Conference, without unnecessary cruelty. Xot much
attention has so far been given to the fact that none
of the Central and South American nations is per
\ niittcd a voice in this conference. Xot being per
: mitted to speak, they are evidently thinking, and the
frank proposition of Cecil Rhodes, that, being in
capable of resistance, their conquest shall be consid
ered a part of the white man's burden, forms the prin
cipal subject of their thoughts.
Some one has recently compared the United States
to the strong lion which, by a process of evolution
and for the purposes and pleasures of diet, destroys
j and assimilates to himself the weaker animals de
prived by nature of the means of defense. In this
view of it a meeting of lions and tigers, to consider
the paths of peace toward each other, would interest
the weaker animals only because it would probably
prevent a fight for the possession of their bodies after
they arc dead.
In any view of it. now is the time for the Christian
bodies of the world to impress upon the conference
j the need of defining more clearly the difference be-
I tween an act of war and common murder.

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNflUGhjT.
Not many people of the vast popula
tion of the United States ever heard
of Miss Helen Wright of San Jose, and
few therefore outside that cltv and the
beautiful valley that surrounds it gave
much if any heed to the recent an
nouncement of her death. To most who
read the brief notice sent out through
the Associated Press it was but tlv rec
ord of another woman gone, and that
was all. Nevertheless all California.
and perhaps it would be no exaggera
tion to say all the United States, suf
fered a loss by that death.
In comparison with the career of
noted women, Miss Wrightdn her work
at the State Normal School lived a se
cluded life; but the iniluence and the
issues of that life were not shut in by
any narrow seclusion. Her nature was
animated by what may be termed an
elemental spiritual force having power
to shine and to warm not only by di
rect rays, but by reflection from the
minds and the hearts of others; so that
from the pupils of the school and from
the circle of her friends, her exalting
and purifying influence was radiated
and spread, heaven alone knows how
far or how strongly, through all the
homes of this broad land of ours.
Miss Wright had n â¢ public career vis
ible to the general eye, or audible to
the general ear, but Providence has or
dained that the blessings which fall
upon the lives of all f us come oft
times in ways of which we are not con
scious, and none can tell how much of
the good we gain from our experience
with the world hafe been rtup to per
sons we never knew, of \ mm -we never
heard, and the re- of whose death
is to us less notable than the fading of
a rose in our garden or the flying away
of a pinging bird from our window.
This much, then, is due this Sunday
morning by way of tribute to one Qf
the. most potent personal influences in
our commonwealth; a tribute which
may be taken in itself as a faint proof
that the twilight of that influence still
lingers on earth, though the radiant
spirit of the light itsci: has passed up
wnrd into the perfect day and van
ished in the infinite.

The heated controversy over the pub
lication of the love letters of Robert
and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, which
had begun to give way to other sub
jects of discussion in literary circles,
has been revived and fanned to a
fiercer heat than ever by a letter re
cently published in the London Stand
ard from C. J. Moulton-Barrett, the
only surviving brother of Mrs. Brown
ing. Th^ letter is of such brevity and
of such Interest to all who give any
heed to literary matters it is worth
reading in full. No digest could do it
justice. It runs thus:
"In spite of earnest protests. Mr.
Browning, with a want of delicacy
hardly conceivable, has published the
letters of his father and mother pre
vious to their "marriage. The careless
indifference of Mr. Kohert Browning,
'There they are, do with them as you
please when I am dead and gone,' was
no excuse for the sacrilege. His mother
would have been horrified. She loved
her father.
"The notices of the book have gen
erally been so cruelly unjust to my
father's memory that 1 consider it
my duty, as his eldest surviving son,
to relate the facts. My father acted
as his own merchant for his Jamaica
estates, and on that account went daily
to the city. He never met Mr. Brown
ing. He was aware of his visits, and
he regarded them, like the visits of
.Mips Mitford and Mr. Kenyon, as af
fording my sister pleasure. My sister
had been an invalid for years. By the
directions of Dr. Chambers her room
was kept at a certain temperature and
she never left it. Under these circum
stances my father lost his daughter.
He had laved her from her childhood.
He never recovered it. I venture to
say few fathers would take the hand
of a man who had so acted. And I
would add, few sons, either for gain
or love of notoriety, would make public
the confidential' letters of their mother.
Yours, etc.,
"C. J. MOULTON-BARRETT.
"Orove, Jacksontown, Jamaica,
March 30."
â¢ * *
Concerning the charge made by Mr.
Moultnn-Barrett that the letters of his
sister and her lover do an injustice to
his father nothing can be paid by the
g. neral puhlic. That can be dealt with
only by those who know the facts. It
is a strictly family affair. The two
other points of the letter, however, are
as discussable as anything under the
canopy of heaven, and every human
being has full liberty to join in the de
bate and help to swell the hullaballoo.
The Question whether it is morally
rip lit for a man welcomed -into any
home to induce a daughter of that
home to elope with him in defiance of
a fuller's command raises the whole
of that world old controversy as to
whether love or duty has rightful par
amount authority over conduct; while
the other question of the right or
\Â»r uig of publishing to the world the
love letters and sweet private confi
dences of eminent people Involves a

It is to be noted that in his poems
.Browning always takes the side of love
against duty. In his creed, there are
no limitations or restrictions upon the
right of love to be sovereign lord of
life. He regarded happiness based
upon love as the thing of supreme value
to the soul, and maintained the right
of every individual to seek and seize
that happiness, no matter how many
other individuals he might have to
trample in the pursuit. Tennyson, as
all the world knows, held the opposite
view, and would say no more in de
fense of Launcelot than "His honor
rooted in dishonor stood and faith un
faithful made him falsely true."
Browning lived up to his creed. Tfp
practiced what he preached, and there
was happiness in his home whatever
there may have been \n old man Bar
rett's. It is after all as good a creed
as another, and if the path of those
who accent it be beset by Remorse
waiting for his prey, it is at any rate
free from the haunting of that ghost
Regret, which forever attends the
thoughts by day and the dreams by
night of those who have turned away
from the cup of joy when offered by
the hand of opportunity. Browning
moreover had the teaching of Blake to j
go UDOD :
Abstinence sows sand all over
'I'! â¢ ruddy limbs and flaming hair;
But desire gratified
Plants, the rose and olive there.
* * *
As the controversy over the action of j
Robert Browning in persuading the !
daughter of his host to elope brings j
into the field of discussion two oppos- j
ing views of morality, so does that over j
the action of young Browning in pub- .
lishing the letters. There is the â¢ mo- j
rality of common folks and the quite ;
different morality of genius in such ;
matters. Ordinary men and women
shrink from disclosing the issues of
their hearts to the public. Such a thing |
as .1 love letter most people regard as j
secret, and most would blush indeed j
"to find it fame." Genius takes an- j
other view of such things.
In the old days when painting was j
the supreme art of the world, the great
men who engaged in it did not hesitate
to use their daughters, their wives and |
their sweethearts as; models whether
they were going to paint a Madonna or
a Venus. The great masters of litera
ture in our time have followed the ex
ample. They have carried the prac
tice so far that Leslie Stephen declares: j
"Literature is in all cases a demoraliz
ing occupation. It is demoralizing be
cause its success implies publicity."
The aim of the poet is to give artis
tic expression to emotions common to
the race, and if he think he has done j
that better in a love letter than he ever
did in a poem he gives the lette â¢ to the ,
world as a matter of course.
** . â¢
â While the great major" of men and
women, upholders of the sure morality
of duty and defenders of the privacy |
of the sweet confidences of love, will
condemn both Browing the elder who
ran away with the girl and Browning j
the younger who published their let- !
ters, it is worth noting that the wo
man in the case, Eli abeth Barrett, ap- .
proved of both actions. She was very
glad that Robert ran away with her,
arid she had no hesitation in telling her !
love affairs to all the world. ! .
The "Sonnets from the Portuguese" I
are nothing more than personal love
letters in the form or verse; and that j
famous one beginning, "First time he i
kissed me he but kis 1 the hand
wherewith I write these lines," is about
as open a confession of the first kisses
of love as could possibly be made. She
has left on record the declaration "the !
world has 1 right to the soul secrets"
of gifted pqople. Such a statement of |
course gave full approval beforehand '
to her son's action; and as for that of j
her husband in carrying her off from j
her father, she gave it emphatic and i
even rapturous approval in a letter to â 
him, in which she said: "Can I look,
back on such things and not thank you j
next to God."
This evidence of the complete satis
faction of the woman in the case ought !
to put an end to the controversy, for j
what was this world created for except i
the satisfaction of women? Ordinary |
.people are no doubt justified in feeling :
bashful about, their love .Letters, but;
they have no right to turn that.bash {
fulness into a code of. morals and try
to impose it upon the soaring singers of :
splendid songs â the lovers who write
of love without being silly.
* * *
There is of course never anything ;
new under the sun, for Solomon said
so, but we never lack for novelties;
and some of them have an appearance !
not only of newness, but even of fresh- >
ness. For example there has drifted
out to this part of the world a copy of
a London freak which has just begun j
publication. It bears the title The j
Eagle and the Serpent, and announces ,
Itself "A journal of egoistic philosophy !
and sociology."
It says' "a race of altruists is neces- j
sarily a race of slaves." It declares for I
war on the ground that any man who ;
is so big a fool as to, sacrifice himself !
for his country should be sent at once
to the slaughter and got rid. of. It as- 1 i
serts the. bane of our civilization is the
altruism of women, their ever ready
willingness to sacrifice themselves, and j
adds: "No egoistic woman will give a j
gift unless she has received one of |
equal value. She will make no one
happy unless she is made happy like
wise. This just and wise doctrine will i
act as a beautifier on women of all !
ages. The young will be made more j
beautiful and those. advanced in years j
will be rejuvenated."
Proceeding to the task of revising the ]
words of the ancients and the wise, the !
egoistic philosopher declares David !
should have said, "I have been young i
and I am old and I have never seen j
the righteous do anything but beg
bread"; quotes with approbation !
Heine's saying, "I will forgive my ene
mies when 1 see them all hanging from !
the tree in my back yard," and. has the J
audacity to suggest that Jesus should '
have said to the sinner. "Neither do I j
condemn thee; go and do it again."
* ' * ::â :â â â¢'-;â ;
From (he high poetic egotism of
Browning's belief 'that every human
creature has a divine right to love and j
happiness wherever they are to be I
found to the blatant screed from Lon- !
don is a long stride: and yet they are â¢
of a kin. Fortunately it is a big, wide ;
world and there is room enough in it!
for all kinds, I do not know that the j
welfare of the good and 'he beautiful
and the wise absolutely requires the
elimination from the face of the earth
of anything that now existsâ

When Collis P. Huntington in the
flush of his hospitality said virtually to I
his guests at his banquet the other |
evening, "The weakiv of the people;
of this country is caused by too much :
education â look at your university '
graduates and then look at me," he !
doubtless thought he was announcing a j
wisdom never before uttered by man, j
but he wasn't. .Several ages ago a j
Lombard barbarian who had overrun
Northern Italy said much the same
thing. A certain nohk approached that '
magnate one day, when he was in a
good humor after dinner and massacre, j
and advised him to set up a school in
which young Lombards could be taught
how to read. "Got out, you fool," said I
the conqueror; "what's the good of an
education? You can read and I can't,
but 1 have licked you once and I can
lick you again."
That is the way the br Marians rea
soned {Luring what! is known as the
dark nsf*s. All the world knows, how
ever, that in the course of time the
Lombards learned to read and write
and do several sums in arithmetic, and
it is therefore reasonable to expect Mr. â¢
.Huntington will .be eventfully ed i. i
cated. Of course it would be futile to
hope for his enlightenment in this life,
for he is too old and his ignorance i<j
too extensive to be explored a. I enÂ«A
up in the years that remain to hinj,
but with an eye of benevolent faith w<?
may see him. provided with an educa
tion in the world to come, even if he
has to go through an all-fired hot time

EXHIBITION OF
THE CALIFORNIA
CLUB BEGINS
Successful Displays of
Arts and Crafts.
The California Club Inaugurated last
night one of the most successful exhibi
tions of arts and crafts that have ever
adorned the walls or covered the floor
space of the Mechanics' Pavilion art pal
lory. The lady patronesses are to be con
gratulated for the artistic ordering and
distribution of tho contributed exhibits,
which till the large hall from end to end.
In the afternoon the club, which num
bers among Its members the most prom
inent society women of this city, held a
reception. Tea was served in the Japan-;
ese Garden, after which came an inspec
tion of the exhibits. The formal opening
was not until the evening, when society,
with a few lovers of art and the tin^r
handicrafts, promenaded the gallery for
two hours or listened to the literary and
musical programme.
There was spme spoech-making and
singing by way of formal Inauguration.
John P. Irish acted an chairman and gen
eral announcer. Following him Mayor
Phelan spoke of the arts as a civilizing
factor and paid a glowing tribute to the
ladles who devised the exhibition. Irving
M. Scott, W. F. Dohrmahn and President
Denicke of the Mechanics' Institute con
tinued in the same strain, showing the
necessity for just such exhibitions and
the good wrought by them. Miss Isella
Van Pelt's singing called for several en
cores and was one of the most pleasing
features of the evening.
The exhibit embraces a variety of art
works and the finer crafts. The entird
north wall is covered with drawings, ar
chitectural designs and graphic illustra
tions of various arts. The exhibits of the
newspapefrs attracted a great deal of at
tention, the work of the local pen and ink
artists being much admired. Ranging
from- grotesque caricatures to tragic
themes the sketches show the many sides
of life from the newspaper artist's stand
point.
The pottery exhibit, under the charge of
Mrs. William Irclan, is another entertain
ing feature of the display. Sculptor Etob
ertsen. surrounded by excerpts of th^
Rubaiyat, works at his clay and molds
his creations in full view.
The leather, tapestry and lace exhibits
as well as the keramie contributions draw
crowds to their special lodgments. Bas
ket work of Indian pattern, carpet weav
ing and silk manufacturing help to di
vide the interest of the spectators.
On the southern wall there are a num
ber of poker etchings which do not es
cape the eye of the watchful. One par
ticularly, "The Crucitixion, " by Mrs. Solly
Walter, is pronounced a remarkable
piece of burn etching. There are many
other beautiful exhibitsâ photographic,
sculptural and what are included under
the generic term of tine artsâ all of which
make a beautiful ensemble effect.
The exhibition committee of the Cali
fornia Club, through whose efforts the
present exhibition has been brought about,

SAILOR TOM SHARKEY
DROPS INTO TOWN
TALKS OF THE COMING BIG
SLUGGING MATCH.
-
Frankly Says He Thinks Fitzsim
mons Will Win in Ten Bounds
or Be Beaten.
Tom Sharkey. the disputed champion
heavy-weight pugilist of the world, ar
rived last evening on the overland from
Chicago.
Sharkey states th'nt his mission to Cali
fornia is one of pleasure and business anil
that he will leave for New York in time
to witness the twenty-five round contest
between "Bob" Fitzsimmons and "Jim"
Jeffries, the big heavy-weight who got a
decision over Sharkey in this city about
a year ago. Sharkey has since that time
tried every -means of getting a return
match with Jeffries, but has always met
with a refusal.
Speaking of the contest between Jef
fries and Fitzsimmons, Sharkey said: "I
am satisfied that Jeffries will get a square
deal and that the best man will win. 1
am of the opinion that If Fitzsimmons
cannot stop Jeffries in ten rounds the
champion of Los Angeles will defeat him.
But you must understand that Fitzsim
mons is a wonder and can administer ter
rific punishment while his strength pre
vails, and if Jeffries can stand the ham
mering he is certainly bound to receive in
the early stages of the game he will as
suredly surprise me.
"I don't th'.n't thnt 'Fltz 1 has snnc
back any, and if he is as good a man to
day as when he fought me 1 should ccr
i^iiily say that no will retire from the
ring with colors flying."
Snarkey will leave for Vallejo on Mon
day to see his old friends, but will return
to this city prior to his departure for New
York, as he Is desirous of being at the
ringside to challenge the winner for the
heavy-weight championship of the world,
which title he contends rightfully belongs
to himself, he having whipped the best
men in the profession.

OFFICIAL PLUMS
ILLEGALLY GIVEN
Gage Did Not Observe
the Law.
SACRAMENTO, May 20.â 1t is re
ported here to-night that Attorney
General Ford has rendered to Governor
an opinion wherein he declares,
in effect, that a number of appoint
ments made by Governor Gage since
the adjournment of the last Legislature
are Illegal, it will be remembered that
Governor Gage withdrew a list of ap
pointmenta made by Governor Budd,
his predecessor, and submitted to the
te for its ratification. Gage failed
to substitute a new list before the final
adjournment of the Legislature and
since then has made new appointments
for the#e offices, which Include the
Trustees of the Normal schools and the
Commissioners of the State Depart
ment of Highways.
It is said that the opinion prepared
by the Attorney General holds that,
these vacancies having occurred prim
to or during th^ legislative session, it
was the duty of Governor Gage, under
the constitution, to have filled them in
season so that the Senate might have
i upon them. The â  pinion con
tends, so it is stated, that all appoint
ments made by the Governor should be
ed; ratified by the session of the Legis
lature Immediately following, and
further in effect that it is not the in
tention of the law that each Governor
on taking office shall have the power
to withdraw a list of appointments
made by his predecessor without fol
lowing them with a substitute list, to
be acted upon by the Legislature at the
session before which the original list
was submitted.

Wadsworth-Reine dOr three-year-old
filly Rush to-day over a muddy track.
May Htmpstead, winner of the Tennessee
Derby and the Tennessee Oaks, met her -
lirst defeat in this, race, partly because :
Rush, at the weights and over a track
exactly io her liking, was best, and partly
i because Turner. who rode May Hempstead,
was overconfident. Rush shot to the front
at Qagfall and opened a gap of three
lengths. Turner, on Hempstead, figured
that Rush would come back to him and
let her get six lengths in the lead, when
the head of the homestretch was reached. \
, Hill kept Rush going and Hempstead
could never get any closer to her, though
! Turner rode her vigorously until he saw ;
' that his mount was beaten, when he eased
; her up. This was the last day of the Lou

SUDDEN DEATH
From Heart Disease.
A Prominent Merchant Suddenly
Expires While at His Place of
Business.
How frequently we see the above or
similar announcements. People are full
of pity for the family of the man so
suddenly and sadly stricken. They say
"How terribly sudden! Why, I saw
him yesterday and he looked good for
thirty years." Exactly! The bridge at
Ashtabula looked good for fifty years
the day before the great accident.
Great trains ran in safety along the
trembling trestles which in a few more
hours were to collapse in a fearful
fall. The Iron in them had been grad
ually disintegrating for years. The
death of this man was no more sudden
than the fall of the bridge. Each had
the strength slowly undermined. And,
like the bridge, when the man's
strength reached its minimum resisting
capacity down he went.
There's a fact for public considera
tion. One form of disease is rarely
responsible for a premature death.
Time and time again the doctor in at
tendance on the man suffering from
typhoid or other fever says. "I could
have pulled that man through if it had
not been for his weak stomach."' And
that "weak stomach" is the one ever
present danger to the business man.
He has his warnings. Time and again
his stomach cries out, revolting ai
the food given it, perhaps ejecting it
forcibly. Time and again he gasps and
claps his hand to his heart when it
gives a sudden, suffocating leap. Time
and again, when his starved nervea
have protested by headache, neuralgia
or some other form of pain, he has
thought he must get medical treat
ment. And when his wife finally says,
pleadingly, "My dear, do get something
for your neuralgia," or "You must do
something for your stomach, " what
does he do? He just steps into a drug
store as he goes downtown and gets
something in the tablet form which
dulls his pain and permits him to keep
at work, but which does not oppose a
straw in the way of the disease. Thus
the undermining process goes on until
the collapse comes, with its shock to
the family and surprise to the friends.
THE WARNINGS.
The first necessity of every man is to
heed the warnings Nature gives, that
this undermining process is going on
in his system. A stomach weakened
by abuse, gorged with over eating or
overburdened with hot bread, too rich
or greasy foods, or those too highly
seasoned, becomes weakened and fails
to thoroughly digest the food. A
heavy, sodden mass is accumulated in
the stomach to ferment as the first step
in its decay, giving off foul gases to
distend the stomach and poison the
blood until it becomes thin, weak and
lacking in the red corpuscles so neces
sary to perfect health.
The overdlstended stomach presses
upon the heart, and the latter organ is
also disturbed through sympathy, the
same system of nerves being distributed
to- both organs. Thus palpitation and
Irregular action of the heart, with its
attendant shortness of breath, result,
and in time disease of the heart itself
is established.
The gases and other poisons gener
ated from undigested, fermenting and
decaying food in the stomach becloud
the brain, causing headaches and pain
In the eyes.
Being absorbed into the blood these
poisons reach every part and organ of
the system. The kidneys are thereby
pcisorif-d, causing Bright's disease and
diabetes. Filtering through the skin,
troublesome skin diseases often show
themfcf.lves.
As every organ and every nerve de
pend for their nourishment and renewal
upon the stomach, weak digestion
shows itself not alone in loss of appe
tite and flesh, but also in nervousness,
debility, bad complexion and many
otner derangements.
Some people know whore the trouble
Is. They locate it in the stomach, be
cause they have pain there after eating,
an irregular craving for food or an ap
petite that eating does not satisfy.
There is heaviness after a meal, a feel
ing of undue fullness. Perhaps the
stomach sours and there are bitter ris
ings and belchings. These symptoms
mark various forms and stages of
"weak stomach." They will not all be
present in every case or. in the earlier
stages of the disease. Any one of these
symptoms locates the trouble in the
stomach and the digestive and nutritive
functions, which are disturbed.
The only way to properly heed these
warnings is at once to
JOIN HANDS WITH NATURE'S
FORCES
In an intelligent and persistent effort to
restore the health to its normal condi
tion. This cannot be done by treating
diseases which are only symptoms of
the real and fundamental trouble. The
heart palpitates, but it is of no use to
treat the heart while the diseased
stomach causing the palpitation goes
unheeded and unhelped. The nerves
tingle and twitch with pain. But it's
no use to take bromide preparations to
quiet the nerves, drugging them into
drowsiness as crying children are some
times drugged. What the crying child
generally needs 'is food. The nerves
cry also because of hunger. You can
only stop the outcry c.-f the nerves by
feeding them, and that must be don*?
through the stomach. In thousands and
thousands of cases it has been shown
that when the stomach, together with
its allied organs of digestion and nutri
tion, are put into sound condition of
health the health of the whole body is
at once restored. Strength comes back,
the color returns to the cheek, the
sparkle to the eye, the spring to the
step. There's real interest in life, real
pleasure in business, real comfort in
home. The nerves are quiet. They
laugh sometimes, but they never cry.
The heart works steadily and noise
lessly, like some perfectly governed
engine. The liver performs its func
tions unobtrusively. The kidneys do a
day's work every day in filtering out
the impurities which would clog the
circulation, the lungs are actively
healthyâ in brief the whole body in all
its parts works together to carry on the
perfect scheme of physical being.
WHAT TO DO.
Now comes the question, "How can
this ideal condition of health be at
tained?" No one is better fitted to
answer that question than one who
has been cured of disease and been up
lifted into a condition of sound health.
Such a one is Mr. Thomas G. Lever of
Lever, Riehland County, S. C., who
writes: "I was afflicted with what the
doctors called nervous indigestion. Took
-medicine from my family physician to
no avail. In looking over one of Dr
Pierces Memorandum Books I found
my case described exactly. I wrote to
him and made a statement. He sent
me a descriptive list of questions, also
hygienic rules. I carried these out as
best I could, but I thought myself in
curable, as I suffered so much with
pain under my ribs and an empty feel
ing in my stomach. At night would
have cold or hot feet and hands, al
ternately. I was getting very nervous
and suffered a great deal mentally,
thinking that death would soon claim
me. Always expected something un
usual to take place; was irritable and
impatient and greatly reduced in flesh.
I could scarcely eat anything that
would not produce a bad feeling in my
stomach. After some hesitation, owing
to my prejudices against patent medi
cines, I derided to try a few bottles of
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery
and 'Pellets.' After taking several bot
tles of each, found I was improving. I
continued for six months or more, off
and on. I have to be careful yet, at
times, of whit I eat, in order that I
may feel gc/od and strong. I fully be
lieve if any one suffering with indiges
tion or torpid liver or chronic cold
would take Dr. Pierces Golden Medi
cal Discovery and 'Pleasant Pellets' and
observe a few simple hygienic rules he
would soon be greatly benefited, and
with a little perseverance would be en
tirely cured.
"My son, who has weak lungs and
takes cold easily, used jugt one bottle
of 'Golden BdedicaJ Discovery' and was
cured; got strong and very fleshy."
HOW THOUSANDS ARE SAVED.
That is the way that thousands have
been cured, by the patient, persistent
use of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis
covery. The cure by the use of this
remedy may be said to be certain, since
98 per cent of all who use it are
perfectly and permanently cured. The
time occupied in making the cure de
pends upon the stage of the disease and
the condition of the patient. It is folly
to expect that a disease which has
fastened its roots around the vital or
gans of the body, in the slow progress
of years, should be instantly and imme
diately cured. It takes time to cure
complicated diseases, but the cure
comes in time with the use of "'Golden
Medical Discovery."
"In the year 1596 I was taken ouite
sick and our family physician was
called," writes Miss Lula M. Brittle of
Ivor, Va. "He left me some medicine,
but it failed to relieve me. He came
again and again, but my case grew
worse. â¢ I tried every remedy anybody
told me of but still T suffered. One
day I found a little book in which were
printed a few of Dr. Pierces patients'
testimonials, so I sat right down and
wrote to him, describing my suffering.
He replied, advising me what to take.
I immediately sent to the drug store
and got one bottle of Dr. Pierces Gold
en Medical Discovery and a vial of his
'Pleasant Pellets.' After taking the
medicine one week. I felt greatly re
lieved; my head did not pain me any
scarcely, and my stomach was relieved
of its burdensome feeling. Sometimes
I had been so I could scarcely breathe,
and could not eat anything without
suffering pain. I thought the death an
gel would knock at my door, for I
thought that there was but death for
me, until the Lord in answer to prayer
to Him, pointed me to the little book
containing Dr. Pierces address. I am
glad to say that, after suffering ten
months from a complicated case of liver
complaint, constipation, indigestion,
suppression of monthly function and
kidney disease, too, I reckon, for I suf
fered excruciating pain in my back and
head, fix bottles of 'Golden Medical
Discovery,' three vials of Dr. Plerce'a
Pleasant Pellets and two bottles of his
'Compound Extract of Smart-Weed'
cured me entirely. I gladly recom
mend Dr. Pierces medicines to all suf
ferers."
COMMON SENSE TREATMENT.
The diseases which originate in the
stomach are cured through the stomach
by the use of Dr. Pierces Golden Medi
cal Discovery. That is the common
sense way of reaching them. The â¢Dis
covery" alters the diseased condition of
the stomach and the organs of digestion
and nutrition. It increases the activity
of the blood-making glands, so increas
ing the supply of the vital fluid, it
purges the system of effete and waste
matter, which clogs its canals and Doi
sons the current which flows along
the veins and arteries. It removes the
poisons which accumulate when the
kidneys and liver fail in their duty.
When this is done the stomach and its
associate organs begin to provide the
essential nourishment for bone, brain
and blood, in proper proportions. The
nerve centers are nourished into health.
Pains disappear. Sleep becomes rest
ful. The appetite is restored and "srood
digestion waits on appetite." The sal
low and wrinkled skin is replaced by
a smooth skin and bright complexion.*
In fact thr> life is renewed. All this is
done through the stomach.
The operatibn of "Golden Medical
Discovery" is tw .-fold. It first cor
rects the irregularities of the stomach
and the organs of digestion and nutri
tion. Next it "urnlshea the pabulum re
quired by nature to feed the starving
organs of the body. It restores health
in Nature's own way, by nourishment.
DOES NOT INEBRIATE.
There is no alcohol, whisky or other
intoxicant in "Golden Medical Discov
ery," neither does it contain any opium
or other narcotic. It does not, there
fore create a craving for intoxicating
stimulants or dangerous narcotics.
If a dealer offers another preparation
as "just as pood" as "Golden Medical
Discovery" it's because it pays him a v
trifle more profit to sell an inferior y
preparation. Such a man does not e;ire
for your health. Go to the dealer who
gives you what you ask for. and who
does not insult your good judgment by
urging upon you something as "just as
good. l '

90S Broadway, May 20. ; '
A BUSINESS session in the morn
ing, recreation for the seniors and | j
interesting meetings of the jun- j ;
iors in the afternoon made up i
the day's programme of the Christian j :
Endeavorer convention to-day.
After much good-natured rivalry and
not a little able campaigning Stockton :
carried away the honors from, Sacramento
and it was decided that the Endeavorers
hold their annual convention in the open- '
J. A. WILES Was Chosen State
PresideQt Amid General Er)
thusiasm.
me roar of the new century in that city.
Sacramento took its defeat gracefully
and standing accorded Stockton a vote of
congratulation.
Next in importance to selecting where
the 1900 State convention should meet was
the report of the nominating committee,
that declared the fallowing officers elect
ed to serve during the ensuing year:
President, James A. Wiles. First Raptisn
Church. San Francisco; first vice presi
dent, J. E. Coulthuttt, San Diego Pres
byterian Church; second vice president.
Dr. J. N. Ward. D. D. S.. Auburn Congre
gational Church; third vice president,
John Bonner, Stockton; general secre
tary Francis W. Reid, pastor Congrega
tional Church. Clayton, Contra Costa
County treasurer. James M. Warren,
Santa Barbara Christian church; junior
superintendent of Northern California, E.
L. Rickford, Napa Presbyterian Church;
junior superintendent of Southern Cali
fornia. Belle P. Kason, San Diego Congre
gational Church.
Another important announcement made
at the junior session was tftat of the
banner counties. Los Angelas County car
ried off the banner on junior societies and
membership.
San Francisco was awarded the banner
for intermediate societies and member
ship. To Alameda County went the banner
for the greatest number of new societies
organized within the year. The Central
M. K. Intermediate Society in Oakland
was declared the banner intermediate so
ciety of California and the Presbyterian
Intermediate Society, San Luis Obispo,
was awarded the Craft's Lords day ban
ner.
Although in Its third day's session none
of the papers read lost its interest, nor
the vast number of listening Endeavorers
their attention or enthusiasm.
Tt.ars or laughter were often danger
ously close to one another and when the
burden of the work began to bear heavily
upon tired though willing shoulder? the
audienop took up the inspiring refrain of
some well-known hymn and the gloom
was dispelled.
Rev. Mr. Hayes added a bit of delicious
humor to the business of the morning
meeting by telling of what he had b< en
told was the latest invented collection
box.
"This collection box is bo arranged,"
I said the reverened gentleman, "that if
you drop a dollar or 50 cents Into the
I box it falls upon a cushion. A nickel
I rings a bell loud enough to be heard by
' the entire congregation and a button <>r
' beer ticket when deposited fires off a pis
t..]."
Afir-r the morning business was trans
acted and the new president was greet
ed and had returned thanks the ex-State
president addressed the convention.
C. F. Baker was the first speaker. He
called his address "Sticks. Bricks and
Stone. '" "Every church hath sticks," said
i the gentleman, "but they are not helpful.
The difficulty of some sticks is that thry
bfcve knots in them. Others again have
splinters. Then there are those that are
crossgralned. Bricks are better than
sticks. And that's what we want in our
societyâ every man a brick.
"The best support of the church is the
stone and we need stone on stone so as
to strengthen and solidify the church.
Stone is enduring and lasting and that is
the kind of support we should give to our
churches."
\V. G. Alexander of San Jose followed
Mr. Baker. The well-known junior worker
referred to himself as a "has been"' and
commented upon the development of tue
society since the day when he presided
over the destinies of the State organiza
tion.
C. Z. Merrltt spoke of the consecration
meeting. Among other things the gentle
man said: "Consecration is an attribute
I of Christian life and it is that which
makes it possible for us to perform the
functions of Christian life."
Rev. E. B. Hayes of Gilroy.when speak
ing of the "Tenth Legion." said:
"The strength of the Endeavorers is the
strength of God. God has given to us.
and if we only give back to him the work
will continue to prosper. God has re
vealed to us in his Word how to give, and
that is to give according to how the Lord
prospers us."
Rolla V. Watt in his address on "Mis
sions" took occasion to remark: "Chris
tianity will never dominate the world un
til we set aside our petty differences and
present an undivided front." , ,
Rev. A. Boyer closed the session with
an elevating address. "Patriotism that is
superior to every form of patriotism is
the patriotism that comes from the Lord
Jesus Christ" was the substance of Mr.
Boyer's paper.
The afternoon meeting of the juniors
at the Presbvtcrian church was marked
by all the earnestness and true Christian
spirit that has characterized the work nf
the seniors. The addresses were minia
ture editions of what the seniors had
said. The- orchestra of juniors, led by
Miss Higgins of the First Congregational
Church, Oakland, and the chorus of 150
voices led by Miss H. Borland of the First
Presbyterian Church, were features of
the most impressive affair.
Among the junior? who took an active
part wore Herman Eggert, Charles Rob
inson, Audrey Dodson, the Misses Mabel
and Hazel Roberts of San Jose, and Irv
ing Adams of San Jose.
Thy light is come" was the theme of
the session to-night, which opened with
special music led by ex-Chief of Police
Lloyd. Rev. S. C." Patterson of Lodi
spoke briefly on "A Few Quiet Moment?."
and told his hearers that it is not alone
activity and iubilation that were neces
sary to progress, but that it is wise oc
casionally to stop and reflect for a brief
moment.
Children from the Chinese Mission gave
some special music, which called forth
much appreciation from the big audi
ence.
E. Li Chapman, State superintendent of
the Anti-Saloon League, left no one in
the dark concerning his views of the at
titude the Christian Endeavorer should
assume toward the liquor traffic. The
speaker argued that if all Endeavorera
were to make temperance work a spe
cial subject the traffic would soon be
driven out of California.
Rev. Robert Mackenzie. D. D., made a
short address and in impressive language
Rev. Father Clark told of "God's pur
pose for Christian Endeavorers." "This
convention is not all of Christian En
deavor." he said. "In fact, it is a very
small part of it. It requires perhaps lit
tle effort to come to a grand gathering
such as this, but it is the carrying out
of lessons taught here that constitutes
the purpose for which you are called. In
the home, at work, everywhere do the
work of God and all the world will feel
the effect of your faithfulness."
The session closed with .prayer by Rev.
W. L. Gaston of Santa Rosa.
GARDEN CITYS WILLING
Good Prospect of the Relay Race Be
ing Ridden Over.
The Garden City Wheelmen of San Jose
have sent the following letter to The
Call:
SAN JOSE. Cal.. May IS, 1899.
Cycling Editor The Callâ Sir: Would
you kindly insert in your -paper that the Gar
den City Wheelmen's relay team would be
only too glad to have the race of last Sun
day ridden over. We acknowledge accepting
pace on a couple of our relays, but in regard
to out having arranged anything before the
race with the Olympics, that is absolutely
false.
We did just exactly as any other club -would
have done in our position. We started out
in the lead with the Olympics and worked
with them to keep away from the other two
clubs, thinking wo had as good a show at
the end to win as the- Olympics, and think
if it is ridden over we can easily defeat any
Of the three club? we rode against last Sun
day. Hoping you will give this space In your
paper, 1 remain, respectfully yours,
J. W. DERMODY.
As the Acmes and Garden Citys are so
strongly In favor of riding the race over
again, there is a strong probability that
the association may order this done. The
Bay Citys have not expressed any opin
ion and are purposely keeping in the
background, as it was their old-time ri
vals, the Olympics, who won the race,
and it would be unsportsmanlike for them
to urge any* protest. An official of the
club was willing to be quoted as saying:
"If the association votes to run it over
you can say that we will be ready with
our team."
The Olympic relay team was banqueted
last night, and the Bay City's will have
the same pleasure to-night at a down
town rotisserie.

A WOMAN'S SAD HOMECOMING
REACHED PORT ONLY TO FIND
HER HUSBAND DEAD.
A Holiday Jaunt to Alaska and Ha
waii on a Sailing Ship â A New
Crew for the Transport
Sherman.
One of the homing pigeons from the j
United States lofts at Mare Island flew j
aboard the steamer Greenwood last I
Thursday. Captain Fajerlund was in his
cabin at the time and the bird made its
way in through the open port and set
tled down exhausted on the taUe. The
bird had been flying from 5:35 p. m. on the
16th to 5:30 a. m. on the ISth inst. After i
sivins the pigeon some bread crumbs and !
a drink of water Captain Fagerlund ex- !
amined it for some mark of identifica
tion. On a slip of paper in a quill he
found written: "This bird is the property
of the United States navy yard. If j
caught or shot please report band num
ber to the Bureau of Equipment." On j
another slip of paper was written: "On !
board steamer City of Peking, May 16,
5:35 P- m. L.eft dock at 1:10 p. m. Our j
party for S. E. Department Cavite, Ma
nila, composed of H. D. Smith, F. H. j
Sovereign, A. D. Smith, George P. Bitmap :
(several other names were unreadable), â¢
are all well and in much better spirits
than when we started. Best wishes to
all our friends. (Signed) George P. Bur
nap."
"We were five miles outside the heads
when the bird new into my cabin," said
Captain Fagerlund. "That was at 5:30 j
o'clock on the morning of the 18th, and*
the poor little thing was dead btat. It
was all wet and seemed to have been |
in the water, but whether it was or not ;
1 cannot say. If it was released on the
evening ol May lt> it may have nown to
the Farailonea and rested there for the
night and then gone on toward Mare Isl- :
and. Yesterday I took my ship up to j
Port Costa, and while I was there 1 took i
the bird buck to Mare Island. It was one !
of a number they are training and had \
been sent out on the Peking for a les
son."
The steamer Colon arrived from Pan
ama and way ports yesterday. Among
her cabin passengers were Captain J. C.
Bruguiere and A. Alexandroff. The lat
ter is a Russian and cannot Bpeak a word
of English. When Questioned in Spanish
he refused point blank to answer any
questions. All the customs authorities
could get out of him was that be had
$10,000 in roM with him and he wanted to
see the Chief of Police. A clerk from the
Russian consulate was sent for and finally
Mr Alexandroff was straightened 'out and
allowed to land.
Captain Bruguiere was master of the
steamer Starbuck that was wrecked on
the Central American coast a few months
ago. He remained by the vessel until he
saw there was no hope of saving her and
then came on to San Francisco.
What will probably be one of the most
enjoyable pleasure trips ever got up in
San Francisco will leave here about June
1. It will take in "the land of the mid
night sun" and "the paradise of the Pa
cific." besides tither islands of the South
ern Sea?. Hind, Rolph & Co.'s schooner
yacht Honoipu will carry the pleasure
seekers and she will be gone about three
months. From San Francisco the Honoi
pu will go to Killisnoo. -ilaska. Ton days.
one of them the longest in the year, will
be ?p^nt there. Aft.?r watching the sun
sink gradually to the horizon and then
without disappearing gradually rise
again the party will p;iy a visit to Sitka
on the steamer Favorite. Returning to
the Honoipu they will sail for Hawaii. A
stay of two weeks will be made in the
Paradise of the Pacific, r : ving everybody
a fhani'P to sen all th< points of interest.
after which thp schooner's prow will be
turned toward San Francisco.
The bark S. C. Allen arrived from Hon
olulu yesterday. When tjie vessel came
to anchor h very unpleasant duty de
volved upon Captain Johnson. Among the
passengers was Mrs. C. Phillips, a school
teacher in Honolulu. A month or so ago
her husband was taken sick and he came
to California for medical treatment. From
San Francisco he went to Los Angeles
and there he grew gradually worse and
died and was buried. Mrs. Phillips had
a presentiment that all was not well with
her husband and ca.ne to San Francisco
on the Allen prepared to nurse him hack
to health. When the tug Reliance went
out to take the bark to the sugar re
rinery Captain Brokaw told the news of
Mr. Phillips' death to Captain Johnson
and he broke it to the widow.
James Muspratt. one of the engineers
on the transport Sherman, had his foot
crushed in the refr'gerating machinery
yesterday. At the Harbor Hospital Dr.
Himmeibach had to amputate the big toe
of his left foot. The chances are that
Muspratt will he able to go out on the
transport when she sails to-morrow night
or Tuesday morning.
With the exception of the captain and
his- officers the Sherman will take out an
entirely new crew. The men in the en
gineer's department will be: George R.
Kingsland. chief engineer: H. Vinkee,
first assistant: Owen Hickey and W. Cro

The wagon load of tombstones that wont
overboard from the steamer Aurora last
Friday morning was recovered yesterday.
A diver had to be sent down and after
he made the tackle f ast the wagon was
raised without much trouble. The wagon
load of furniture is still at the bottom of
the bay and the chances are that it will

BOERS MAY GET
AN ULTIMATUM
Fiasco to Be Followed by
a Call-Down.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, May 20.â The great Johan
nesburg plot against the Transvaal is
classed as having fizzled out like a
damp firecracker. It is claimed that the
Boer organs first tried to magnify the
affair into another Jameson raid, but
now have abandoned the attempt in de
spair. It is further asserted that the
men arrested comprised a couple of
Boer agents, who, some people claim,
probably engineered the whole scheme.
The remainder of the prisoners are de
scribed by a Times correspondent as a
set of honest but drunken wastrels,
whose intention was. only to prepare
for the defense of the town against pos
sible Boer violence in case of war. The
police are believed to be responsible for
the discovery of the conspiracy. No
body thinks that President Kruger
knew anything of the hatching of the
affair, as he is looked upon as being
too shrewd not to see a fiasco.
An interesting insight into Boer meth
ods was given in a report that most of
the barmaids at Johannesburg receive
handsome rewards from the Boer se
cret service fund for spying upon cus
tomers.
Much importance is attached to the
coming meeting between Sir Alfred
Milner, the British High Commissioner
ol South Africa and Governor of Cape
Colony, and President Kruger at Bloem
fontein, capital of the Orange Free
State. There is general anticipation
that Sir Alfred Milner has been in
structed by Joseph Chamberlain, Secre
tary of Stale for the Colonies, to put
forth certain demads In the shape of
concessions to the outlanders, in a form
practically amounting to an ultimatum.
and that the Boers will be required to
accept and carry out the British de
mands within a specified period or the
Transvaal will be occupied by British
troops.
Outlanders who have just returned
from the Transvaal are strongly of th-
(.pinion that President Kruger will now
give in if Great Britain takes the bull
by the horns. They add that the Boers
will arm and that there will bf a rattle
of swords and scabbards, but that they
will finally yield without bloodshed.

capacity he has served for a number of

it has been gossiped here that this was 1

censured him. together with his superior,

EARNESTLY DESIRED.

Hope for Temporary Terms
Pending Adjustment of
Alaska Boundary.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, May 20.â The fate of the
Anglo- American-Canadian Commission
is naturally regarded here as a matter*
of great importance, and the various
rumors and reports on the subject at
tract much attention. A dispatch from
Washington to the effect that the re
sumption of the commission's labor de
pends upon a settlement of the Alaskan
boundary dispute has been published in
this city, and a representative of the
Associated Press made inquiries at the
center of negotiations in London. From
an unimpeachable source he obtained
the following statement:
â J he thorn} i.a^. t of the Alaskan
question makes it probable that the re
sumption of the sittings of the com
mission will be withdrawn from dis
cussion to be taken up later should cir
cumstances be favorable. The Alaskan
question, in fact, has practically been
dropped out of the discussion, and the
statement that its discussion and set
tlement will be the sine qua non of the
resumption of the sittings Of the com
mission is inaccurate."
The representative of the Associated
Press was assured that the matter has
been discussed in the most conciliatory
spirit on both sides. The newspapers
here express regret at the fact that the
Alaskan dispute has grown more acute
at a time when the relations between
the two countries are so cordial, and
the news that thi conference will prob
! ably be resumed in the autumn has
I given satisfaction.
The Globe, commenting on the dis
' patch of American troops to Alaska,
I says: "Pending the meeting of the con
| ference the first step to be taken after
the preliminaries are settled will be to
arrange a modus Vivendi, and no time
must be lost in doing this if the situa-
I tion is not to be lamentably complicat
' ed by n conflict which will make the
final settlement mur * difficult than
1 ever."

STOCKTON, May 20.â Ex-State Senator
D. M. Pool died this morning at the resi

the result of old age, he having been in

Senator Pool was a native of Alabama, a

This ordinance sprang full panoplied In

laughed. But when the Trustees affirmed
their intention to see that the provisions
of the ordinance were respected indigna

PARIS, May 20.â The authorities have definitely decided to prose
cute Dr. Edwards, who claims that he is in some mysterious way the rep
resentative of St. Paul, and who has been practicing his so-called mirac
ulous cures in Paris for some time past.
A magistrate who went to his rooms found crowds awaiting their
turn to be healed, and all excitedly declared that if their savior were
driven from Paris by law they would follow him wherever he went. A
number of ladies of the foreign colony have given most enthusiastic' cv!
dence in favor of the mystic who is charged with illegally practicing
medicine. Cleo de Merode, Emma Calve and L'oie Fuller, besides manj
authors and artists, are willing to testify in his behalf.

â¦
Democratic Axes Are Grinding While
Rival Factions Rapidly Organize
and Await Imminent Party
Developments.
â 
â¢
The local Populist partj is rubbing its i
hands and getting ready to cut a small !
but active and possibly important figure
in the municipal campaign. The local â¢Â»
ganization will run a ticket for cdnven
tlon delegates at the primary election,
hold a municipal convention and run a â 
local ticket of some sort. As this year j
the Non-Partisans and other sideshows j
are barred from having tickets, the Popu- :
lists will cut a. moreTiotlceable, figure than;
before. Though the vote is small, hardly j
more than 3000, it may possibly be used
for political juggling in an important
way.
The first thing that will whisk flies off i
the party will l>e the primary election, at
â which the two bitterly opposed factions
will contend for the mastery of the ma
chine. The faction led by George D. Oil- j
lespie, A. B. Kinne et al. is now in con
trol of' the organization and expects to j
maintain its mastery. The other faction,
led by George VV. Montclth, Dr. W. N. |
Griswold ami others, which la now out in j
the cold, is expected to struggle fiercely i
to capture the convention and so secure
"the works."
The affairs of the party are in the i
hands of the executive committee, of
which <:<?orge D. Gillespie is chairman
and A. B. Kinne secretary. This execu- >
tiv,- committee; representing the legal I
partj organization; has the appointment,
etc . of delegates entirely in its own
hands and has adopted a plan by which
t wins at the primary it will be in
power. There â¢ â ',! be one blanket ticket
i<>r fifty cc". 1 ention delegates voted for
all over the city and any opposition ticket j
must follow thy same plan. The opposl- j
tion will thus have to win a complete!
victory or be wholly shut out of the con- i
\ - entlon and the next county committee. 'â 
The machine will be of value not only i
this year, but in the next campaign and
the fur will lly in. the tight for the prize, j
The primary election over, the Popu- j
list convention will be Looked on wit i
lustful eyes by various bosses. Chris !
Buckley and other bosses have done busi- i
ness in the local Populist convention be
lore. As the law now prevents a formal
indorsement of a candidate of another
party, the convention can take up no fu
sion scheme; but many possibilities re
main. The party must run a party ticket
to poll per cent of the vote and main
tain its standing as a party, but it need
not run a full ticket. Two or three can
didates would do. So, if it were de
sired by the controlling powers of the
convention- to help out â â  Democratic can
didate, the office might be left blank. An- I
other possibility already canvassed lies in j
th^ scheme of nominating a fairly strong
and popular "surf head' of a part) whose
defeat was wanted, so that he might pull
strength from the regular candidate of j
that party. In these and -other ways the j
little Populist convention may assume
campaign importance.
George D. Gillespio, chairman of the
executive committee, said yesterday:
"'We are going into the primary with a
general ticket of fifty convention dele
gates. The nature of our municipal ticket
is undecided, but the consensus of opin
ion is now that we should run a ticket
complete from top tn bottom, if we wish
to Indorse any candidate we can do so
partially by leaving he office blank and
recommending; our friends to vote espe
cially for him.
"At its last meeting the county commit
tee directed the calling together and re
viving all the district organizations In the
city and this will be done. There are
pretty good organizations in the Thirty
lirst and In the Thirty-fourth to the
ADVEBTISF.MKNTE.

formed this week. His orderlies are
bringing In the worKers in a lively way
and day and night there is a stream of
thi m going Into the back room at head- :
quarters to report and for directions. The
Buckley plan Is for selected leaders In '
each district to rustle about for support
ers, and when a respectable list of names
is secured to call a meeting and elect i
programmed temporary officers. Then
there Is a hurrah and another meeting
for permanent organization with a stren
uous effort to get in more members.
The Twenty-ninth Club has opened per- i
manent basement headquarters on Fourth
street and bought nine sacks of sawdust.
The Twenty-eighth will have a ball this
week. There are two clubs in the Forty
second, with James O'Connor, who wants
to be Supervisor, as president of one. At
torney C. J. Heggerty of Knight & Heg
gerty is president In the Fortieth. The I
Thirtieth organized two' weeks ago after:
a street procession from Alex Qreggains'
Sixth-street resort, headed by an ancient
lifer and flanked by skirmishers to round I
up the gang. At Music Hall steam beer !
and Rooert Ferral's eloquence were the
features of the evening. Judge Ferral's
eloquence is cutting a frequent figure in :
Buckley organizing. Tim Treacy has done '
the work in the Thirty-first, under the
Buckley plan precinct clubs and a big
Buckley county committee are to follow '
But Chris Buckley is not the only
trump in the game. He is merely the
tirst systematic hustler in the Held". Phe
lanites; Raineyltes and other forces that
wtlr appear later are preparing for gen
eral organization. Considerable has been
done already and much more will be ac
complished within a few days. The De
mocracy will be beautifully" and thor-'
oroughly organized this year. There will
be from three to six rival organizations!
in each district and a Dumber "up- I
stairs." There are already three in the
Thirty-ninth. Some little time ago Dep
uty Assessor 11. L. Blenfleld and J. S.
Edelman, "of Orange," who wants to be '
Treasurer, led in an effort to organize. \
Assemblyman Warden was mollified, and
finally organization was effected in Judge
Slogan's courtroom. It was decided to
meet next in Saratoga Hall, and notices
were sent out. J. A. Fen ton, superintend
ent of the ferry building, and S. 11. Kohl
man slipped around and hired the hall for
that evening, hustling the other fellows
back to the Mogan courtroom. Fish Com
missioner Vogelsang orated and the sec- j
ond club was organized. It was called a j
Rainey Club, but Messrs. Fenton and i
Kohlman prefer to call themselves liar- \
neyites. Now the Buckleyites have got j
up a club and an pendent" club is
already in sight.
There will be some fun in the Forty- i
first, Ed Lanigan's stronghold of the
past. R. 1... Mann, Emil Pohli and others
have led in an anti-Lanigan, anti-boss or- >
ganization that proposes to win the
district. L.anigan makes the same pro- i
posal, and the Buckleyites are muster
ing. Then there are all sorts of other
Democratic organizations that are wak
ing up. There is the big Democratic Cen
tral Club, with nearly 2000 members,
which has just opened headquarters In
the Emporium building. In theory it Is
supposed to be non-factional. As it in- !
eludes all factions in its membership it is
freely predicted that it will see storms.
Its president is Oscar Hocks, who is act
ing president of the German Democratic
Club, very active in fraternal organiza
tions, and who is one of the new entries i
In politics. His ambition is understood to !
be directed to the City Hall. Its board i
of trustees and its advisory board pre- !
sents an imposing list of Democratic pol
iticians. Buckley is not the only one ;
credited with an effort to "capture" the
club. High jinks is held frequently and i
great efforts are being made to get in
members.
The German Democratic Central Club
has awakened to life and will revive its
six affiliated district clubs within a week.
The Iroquois Club is supposed to keep
out of factional â¢ troubles, but factional
troubles are apt to get into the club.

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL., SIKBAT, MAY 21, 1899.
GETAWAY DAY
AT OAKLAND
A GLOOMY ONE
Rosinante Crushed
the Talent's Hopes.
FINISHED ABSOLUTELY LAST
JENKINS KEPT UP HIS GREAT
SADDLE RECORD.
Benamela and Catastrophe the Long
est-Priced Winners â Recreation
Displayed Rare Form â Two
Successful Choices.
A large crowd of enthusiastic specta
tors attended the closing day of the rac
ing season at Oakland track yesterday.
Of course there was a "getaway" stake.
It was reserved for the last number on
the cardâ a mile and a furlong runâ and
what a disastrous one it proved for the
talent in general! Jimmy OofTey's mure
Kosinante was whispered about as the
"goods," and from 4 to 1 her odds fell
to ;< to ."Â«. There were but three other
starters â Daisy F, May \V and La Go
leta. The result was most distressing to
the friends of Rosinante, for th<_- mare
was target hearer from start to finish.
Maj W, with W. Narvaez in the Saddle,
part Of the distance under wraps, made
the running to the stretch, where La <Jo
leta was at her saddle skirts. Bassinger
on the latter then made his. move, and
the Baldwin mare won swinging In 1:52%,
within a quarter of a second of the coast
record. Driving hard, Jenkins brought
Daisy F up in time to beat May W a
luad for the place. The winner was the
outsider in the betting, going to the post
5 to 1.
Many on the lookout for a grub stake
took a "flyer" on the rank outsider, but
the expected 100 to l shot never came;
Benamela and Catastrophe at odds of 8
to 1 were the longest priced winners. Of
the favorites but two were successful.
In tiie saddle Jenkins kept up his splen
did record, reaching the wire first on
three winners. During the week just end
ed the promising rider accepted thirty
seven mounts, oi which number be won
on nineteen, eclipsing the record made by
Tod Sloan when here last.
Jockey Jenkins started in the day by
piloting Sir Irian to the front in tha
open tog mile and a sixteenth selling run.

lead, winning In a drive a head before

a cheap band of "dogs" started in the
second event at a mile. Catastrophe, an
s to i shot, won handily from Inverary
11. the lukewarm favorite. Pongo tooK

Backed from ihr> â â¢? to even money fa
voritism, Jenkins put Karl Cochran over
the plate winner of the Becond mile and
a sixteenth run. Silver State took the
].!.i., from I. A. Finnegon.
It looks as if Recreation had regained
her old form, for the second mile selling
affair was only a promenade for the mare.
A 3 to - choice, she disposed of her field
without trying, winning eased up from
OllnthUS. Highland Hall, at I'O to 1,
dropped into the show.
Th( tilth race, at one mile arid a six
teenth, fell easy prey to Benamela. The
brown gelding was going away at the

Track Notes.
Howard, the Australian plunger, spread
his coin about the ring in larve poriions
j on Rosiaante.
With a fair start the rifth. race "would
have been easy for Jennie Reid. The
mare was also badly interfered with by
Benamela opposite the padd/jek.
Jockey Tom Glover took a sharp header
when Henry C fell on the back stretch.
He escaped with some severe cuts and
bruises.
The majority of owners at the track
possessing the necessary meang will jour
ney to Denver. Liberal prizes are offered
and reports say the meeting will be the
greatest in the history of Colorado. The
; jockeys, too, are all heading in that direc
tion.

JUDGE CONLAN IS
A CRACK ANGLER
SURPRISED H^o FRIENDS IN
LONG-DISTANCE CASTING.
Dynamiters, pot-hunters and all those
who transgress the game and fish laws
would better steer clear of Judge Conian,
I as his Honor is now n prominent member
! of the Munchausen Fishing Club, which is
j the largest and most influential angling
â  association west of the big mountains.
The Judge has been taking quiet les
; sons in long-distance fly-casting and
; -shrimp baiting fur some time past from
| that well-known disciple of Walton, M.
; Lewis, who is bettor known as the dia-
I mond man from South Africa.
I A few days ago his Honor informed a
! few of his most intimate friends that he
; would like a little outing on Lake Pilar
: citos and his bailiff 'ost very litt!.- time
i in hunting up Charles Webb Howard Esq.
of the Spring Valley Water Company,
who kindly granted the Judge and his
party of pleasure-seekers permission to
clean out the lake of its silvery uonizens.
The party was composed of his Honor I
Judge Conian, George Kelly <i. Berger,'
M. Lewis and John Henrioulie..
When the festive crowd of lake-whip
pers arrived at their destination after a
pleasant morning's ride from this city
the Judge cast a crarin glance at the lakÂ»
and seeing a break in the water about
half a mile from the bank he tapped
Lewis on the shoulder and said something :
which sounded to Berger like "This will
bfl a great day, Lewis, for long-distance
fly-casting."
Berger was astonished at the Judge's
remark and wondered if his Honor really
thought that he could possibly reach the
trout that rose at some winged insect by
casting from the bank.
Suspiciously he (Berger) whispered into
the ear of John Henrioulie the words:
'â¢John, we're not in it; the Judge must
be a second Mansfield if he can cast a
ny half a mile."
Henrioulie smiled 'and throwing a cun
ning wink at Kelly remarked: "Why his
Honor is a dandy on the fly; he can i
ptretch a yarn ux- full length of the lake !
and never crack a smile. Wait until you
see him perform."
The anglers had finally adjusted their
fishing tackle and each man took a kill- I
Ing position. The Judge fortunately got I
the only boat on the lake thai was dry
within, and as t lie day was propitious for
angling the anglers met with little diffi
culty in catching trout ranging in weight
from a quarter of a pound to two pounds. |
But when the days sport was over and
each man counted up his catch Lewis had
the lowest string, and his companions
"joshed" him so hard that he actually
Bhed tears of sorrow. But Lewis struck
a happy thought, and demanding silence
said: "Well, boys, although you all put
it on to me, I can assure you that had
it not been for the unfortunate accident
< I would be the happiest man in the
bunch."
"Tell us all about it. Lewis old boy."
| said Berger, as he chuckled to himself" at
j the thought of having lowered the colors
of the champion lisherman of the party.
"Well, listen. A few years ago the Fish
Commissioners stocked the lake with
, rnuscalonge. which is a large variety of
Bastern pike, and nothing was seen or
heard of Hum until to-day, when I
hooked a monster over there where you
can see that bliif streak of water cov
ered with weeds and lily pads-. I played
tin flsh for three hours, and was having
' no end of royal sport, while you fellers
were catching little trout.
"Suddenly, and as my valuable prize
was all but done for. the big fish made
a dash and l>n.ke the hook. Why. boys
he was within thrc.. feet of where! stood
when the unfortunate accident happened."
The Judge at this juncture interrupted
the narrator and asked of Lewis if the
fish had seen him.
"Why, of course he saw me," said*
Lewis, gleefully.
"Then," remarked his Honor, with a
benchful smile, "I do not wonder that
the musealonge, or pike as you call it,
broke away. Any fish that could see
your sun-painted face on that day would
smash a hawser in a dash for liberty."
The laugh was on Lewis, but he swears
by Ferguson that he will get even on the
Judge if it is necessary to use dynamite
in the capture of the fish he lost at Pil
arcitos.

tors and investors is directed to this sale.
It is the only offering of unimproved
property having a great prospective value
that has taken place in years.
Every lot in Glen Park Terrace has a
fine sunny exposure and commands a
good view of this new and popular resort,
Glen Park.
It is an admitted fact that all property
adjacent to public or private parks en-
hances rapidly in value.
It is also conceded that no park has ever ;
attained such popularity within the same ,
time as Glen Park.
What Woodward's Gardens were to tho i
city years ago so is Glen Park to-day.
The attendance at Glen Park Dewey day

the near future will draw fully 100,000 peo- |
pie in a single day.
Wherever such crowds go real estate
values must increase.
Glen Park Terrace commands the key j
to the whole situation.

College of Physicians and Surgeons' Magnificent New Home.
THE laying of the cornerstone of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons was performed yesterday
at the site on Fourteenth- street, between Valencia
and Mission. The impressive services of the Masonic
ritual were conducted by Judge F. M. Angellotti,
grand master, assisted by the members of the Granll
Lodge. "Wine, symbolical of refreshment; oil, of joy, and
corn, of nourishment, were poured uixrn the stone after
It had been properly laid.
Professor J. R. Lame, president of the college, acted
as master of ceremonies. The Masonic Quartet, under
the direction of Samuel D. Mayer, grand organist, ren-
dered the musical portion of the ritual, assisted by the
First Infantry Band, under the direction of Charles H.
Casapsa.
His Honor the Mayor was particularly happy in hia
remarks. He complimented the faculty of. the college
on the auspicious occasion, saying it was a pleasure to
attend the exercises. He said the new building meant
much for San Francisco. It Is well that we encourage
the construction of fine buildings, but more particularly
those dedicated to the purposes of education. The speaker
nfVrred to the building of Mission Dolores Church in
1776, when the slopes within view of those assembled
were but the grazing ground of cattle and sheep. He
then told of the gold era of 1549 and claimed that this
Is the educational era and discloses a great State founded
upon the prosperity which comes from field and mine.
He spoke of San Francisco as a jewel set between the
University of California at Berkeley and Leland Stan-
ford Jr. University at Palo Alto. He quoted President

STICK WORK
Oakland Loses a Very
Fast Game.
Afar back in the dim, misty past some
Socrates of the diamond (Gladiator Pete
Browning, maybe) uttered the great truth
that "It's hits what wins ball games."
V- sterday's contest between San Fran
cico and' Oakland at Recreation Park
proved the wisdom of this utterance, for
while Oakland played an almost flawless
fielding tamo, the locals plugged up a
half dozen overripe bungles; but notwlth-
Btandirig their misplays they batted out a
victory after the largest Saturday crowd
of tin- season had made up their rrfinds
that Hanks men had gone skating.
It is true that the Dudes' total number
Of swats equaled that of the locals, but
they came in driblets when there were no
men on bases, while the longshoremen
sent theirs out on longer journeys
and at times when they would do the
most good. Oakland had ten men left on
bases, while only three of the home team
perished, and that tells the whole storyâ
or most of It. There were times when
"Old Reliable" Rube became cross-eyed
on balls and strikes, apparently to the
disadvantage of the visitors but the best
of us are liable to err and Rube makes no
pretensions to infallibility.
Up to the eighth inning the game more
than met the expectations of the fanatics.
Oakland took the lead at the start, only
to be tied up in the sixth; but in the
eighth the locals fell upon Russell's
curves for four mighty punches, netting
three runs and the game.
There was some remarkably clever
fielding on both sides, Lange of Oakland
carrying off the honors w-ith some one
handed stops and throws tnat seemed al
most impossible. Krug made a wonderful
running pick-up at short, which was dv
'â  plicated by Scnmeer, w-hile Peeples kept
: m the game with a circus eaten that re
sulted in a double play.
In the sixth inning Joshua P. Riley was
soaked in the block by a pitched ball and
went down and out. He recovered in time
to play the string out. but was at a loss
whether to wear his cap in the old place
or on the new lump that was erected over
his tar. That clout tied the score, for
Swindells, who ran for Joshua, made the
circuit.
Oakland was handicapped by the ab
senceof Hardie. "Old Clamjuice" shaved
his moustache off early in the week in
fulfillment of his bet with Fred Lange,
and has been laid up w-ith lumbago ever
since. But such are the vicissitudes that
confront a ball player.
Oakland began its run getting in the
first inning. Donovan was safe on Sulli
van's error and was advanced to second
on Lange's single after Schmeer had
struck out. A beautiful double steal that
rattled Swindells placed Donovan on third
j and Lange on second. The Frisco catcher
! tbrew wild to check Donovan and Jack
kept right on home. The team completed
I its touring in the third. Schmeer led off
| with a double, took third on Lango's out,
i Knight to Sullivan, and scored on Ham
mond's single to left. The hit got away
from Muller and Hammond went on to
second. Peeples drove one to Riley, who
fumbled, letting Hammond around" to the
third station. Johnson was given a i>;<-<s
and Dunleavy sent a long fly out to Mul
ler, Hammond beating the ball home
Johnson w*g thrown out at second by
Swindells, leaving Peeples on third.
â \Yith three runs to the bad and their op
ponents playing perfect ball. Harris' men
started in to bat out the game. They got
fairly started In the fourth. Pyne" was
given his base on balls, and after Krug
I was retired on a fly to Moskiman, com
i pleted the circuit on Riley's triple, josh
i following him home when Sullivan
i touched off a double. In the sixth Riley
! got that soak in the head, and while he
was recovering Swindells trotted to first
I for him. Sullivan smashed out a long
I single and Swindells came all the way
around, though It was a close decision at
the plate.
Oakland's finish came in the eighth.
Pyne was safe on Johnson's error, the
only misplay on the side. Krug followed
with a double and Riley's long fly to
Donovan let Pyne home. Sullivan's sec
ond double scored Krug and singles by
Muller and O'Neil put Sully across the
I rubber. The Score:

Harper of Chicago a? saying that the four great educa-
tional centers of the United States are Chicago, Boston,
New York and San Francisco.
In closing, his Honor said we are doing our part in
bringing about a realization of the destiny of San Fran-
cisco. He spoke of this city as a veritaole fountain of
youth, where people come and enjoy health, that blessing
without which life is not worth living. He then con-
gratulated the faculty upon that great institution the
cornerstone of which had just been laid.
The remaining speakers were Judge R. B. Carpenter
â¢and Julius Kahn. The former praised the officers of the
college and told of its marvelous growth during the three
years of its existence. Congressman Kahn dwelt on the
great field for research open to the students of the twin
sciencesâ surgery and medicine. He affirmed that thÂ«
faculty had loftier ideals and entertained worthier am-
bitions than the mere grinding out of graduates. He
hoped the latter might add luster to the glory of the
college.
The beautiful silver trowel with which Grand Master
F. M. Angellottl laid the cornerstone bore this inscrip-
tion:
Presented to F. M. Angellotti, grand master of
Masons, at the laying of the cornerstone College
of Physicians and Surgeons, May 20, 1899.
A throng of people attended the exercises, filling
every vantage point from which the ceremony could be
witnessed. In the crowd the red and white colors of the
students were conspicuous, with here and there the pur-
ple ribbon of thtÂ± junior class men.

Santa Cruz Shuts Out San Jose.
SANTA CRUZ, May 20.â The best game j
of baseball seen here this season â was |
played this afternoon between Santa Cruz J
and San Jose, and was won by Santa Cruz
by a score of 3 to 0. It was a pitched
battle between Borchers and Donlin. Un
til the fourth inning not a run was made,
although Santa Cruz had the bases filled
twice. In the fourth inning Clark of the
home team tallied on a passed ball by
Hansen. In the sixth Santa Cruz made
a run through an easy ball passing
through O'Dea's hands. Kleiber, the new
shortstop for Santa Cruz, did great play
ing, making two base hits. In the fifth
inning he caught a fast ball, rolled over
and managed to put out his man at first.
The same teams meet to-morrow. The
score:

Sacramento Again Defeated.
SACRAMENTO, May 20.-The Sacra
mento ball team tackled the toboggan
slide again and went down before the "Su
gar Beet" boys from Watsonville to-day.
Harper, pitching for the visitor was an
enigma to the end, and put up the pret
tiest game seen here this season. Harvey
was wild at times and his support verged
on tbe ragged. It was a pitchers' battie,
and Harper won by superior generalship.
The five hits off his delivery were widely
scattered and his field was a stone waii.
McCarthy, the visitor's shortstop, picked
up the only error made by his team. The
score:

when the case of Nellie Murphy, the
notorious pickpocket, charged with steal
ing $120 from F. Dunne, a stranger, was
for the fourth time called in Judge Mo
gran's court yesterday the complaining
witness failed to appear, and the Judge

arresting officers that when Nellie is ar
rested again they must book the com
plaining witness and hold him in bonds to
appear to prosecute. A charge of vag

assured his patients of comfort, but when he
positively and absolutely guarantees that his
system will cure, surely this is enough to in-

upsi'ijiring sufferer.
The doctor has written a book on rupture
that explains every detail of his method, and
thia book he will mail free to every one who
writes for it. Pr. Rice is too modest to per-

his cured patients. Mr. H. G. Brown of Klk-

allow his picture to accompany his statement
regarding the marvelous cure which Dr. Rice
caused in his case.
Mr. Brown says: "I am very happy to ac-
knowledge that Dr. Rice's method completely
cured me of a dangerous rupture. I have since
done all kinds of hard work on a farm and
have been as strong and capable as in my
younger days before being ruptured. If all
rui'tur.-d people would try this method I am
certain they would be cured, as Dr. Rice has
a system that is simple, cheap, comfortable
healing and satisfactory to such a degree that
from the very first day a man becomes won-
derfully relieved and satisfied. I cannot in-
dorse the plan too strongly. It cured me and
has cured many others who were enconraÃed

HICELESS VALUE OF A BOY
C. GUSCINSKY IS DESERTED
BY HIS WIFE.
Interesting Cause That Will Be
Heard by Judge Mogan xo-Mor
r< w Morning if the
Wife Appears.
JT-t the first time in the records? of the
Jylioe Â«'ourts a search warrant was issued
by Judge Mogan yesterday for the recov
ery of a human being alleged to have been
stolen, the complaint charging the crime
of grand larceny.
Ilr. C. Goscinsky, 642 Pine street, is the
complaining witness, lie called upon the
Judge and explained that his wife had
deserted him May 8 and had taken with
her their boy, Herbert, 5 years of age. lie
had searched for the boy at Ocean View
and on Noe street, as he had reason to be
lieve he was in the custody of Mrs. Adolph
Itoemer, an intimate friend of his wife. |
but' it was not till last Monday that he
discovered Mrs. Roemer was living at 2
Pearl street, near Market..
He went there and saw his boy, but
Mrs. Roemer denied that he was there.
On telling her that he had seen the boy
on the stairs Mrs. Roemer admitted that â¢
he was right, but said she would refuse!
to deliver him up unless she was paid $tj>i j
for his board, as she had kept him off and I
on for the past three years. Not laving j
the- money Goseinsky had to retire with
out the boy, but later he wrote a letter
!â¢â¢ Mrs. Roemer offering to pay the
amount when he was able, but the letter \
iv;;s returned unopened.
"My wife and 1 lived on Minna street,"
: tinued the doctor, "but as it did not
suitlme 1 engaged a of rooms at 642

understanding with my wife that she
would remove there when my circum

The Judge, after hearing- his story, is

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 21, 1899.
BURNS HAS A
COURT OF HIS
OWN MAKING
This Tribunal Settled
Hart's Bill.
J. B. WRIGHT WAS THE JUDGE
i
SAVED THE COLONEL THE BIG
SUM OF $21,500.
The Mexican Politician Thinks $3500
Ample Pay for the Labors Ex
pended to Keep Him
Out of Jail.
Judgment of dismissal was docketed
yesterday in the suit of General A. L.
liart against Daniel M. Burns, brought
to recover $23,U00 for legal services, and
the case, which grew out of the misdeeds
of Burns while Secretary of State, is
ended, although it may be remarked that
Hart didn't get his money. It is said that
the dismissal was the result of a com
promise, or rather the verdict of a ref
eree, J. B. Wright, prominent in railroad
affairs at Sacramento. A stipulation filed
by General Hart for himself and M. M.
Estee for Burns ordered the dismissal of
the suit. It set forth no facts by which
the amount paid liart can be determined,
but Sluixi is said to be the figure, which,
taken in connection with the great efforts
of General Hart to keep his client out of
the penitentiary for felonious acts and in
creased i (forts to collect the reasonable
value of such services, is indeed a beg
garly .sum, but its payment quite in keep
ing with the man who agrees to pay it.
Thai the services of General Hart on
behalf of Daniel M. Burns Were reason
ably worth the sum. sued for may be
easily determined when the labors of the
attorney are considered. In the year of
1W il was discovered that while Secre
tary of Slate the Mexican politician had
â¢ mbezzled State funds to the extent of
$31,734 0-1. The case against him, notwith
standing his influence at that time, could
not be overlooked, and he fell into the
hands of the police. With a term in
stripes staring him in the face he t-m
--ployed General Hart, and the fight for
his liberty commenced. Twice Burns was
hauled before the Police Court of Sacra
mento on charges of embezzlement and
Hart represented him. Then the plaintiff!
in the action just dismissed used all his ;
taieiit and all his time defending his .
client in twelve actions before the Supe
rior Court of Sacramento, in each of
which Burns was charged with the mis- j
appropriation of public funds. Next a
civil action was brought against Burns to J
recover the amount embezzled, and as i
things became too warm for the colonel j
in that locality the case was transferred
\ 010 County for trial. Hart fought the
matter through to the end, and finally j
becoming wearied at the untiring tight:
Hart was making on behalf of Burns the !
people dropped the case and Burns was]
permitted to go his way. the ease against
him established, but unconvicted of the I
crime.
After this fight Hart presented his bill
for $2 I for his services and was paid
}:>â¢'â "'. This ended the payments, and con
stant requests brought but smiles from
the colonel. So suit was brought to recov
er tli>- balani I the fee, ihe complaint I
being filed November 22, IS9I. In his an
swer Burns did not -deny that the labors
of Genera] Hart were worth the amount
asked: he simply set forth that the attor
ney had agreed t" defend him without
pay and he accepted his services on this
agreement. When he returned from Mex
ico after a fortunate mining venture he
gave General Hart a present of $2iXÂ¥), he
'said, for the many efforts on his behalf.
The answer was unique, as the world has
never known that General Hart so loved
â¢ ! Burns that he was willing to de
-8( rt his business and for a period of years j
defend the colonel in every court of the j
commonwealth in which the crime was i
committed. '
The continued absence of Burns made
repeated continuances necessary, and the '
case never i une to trial before the courts
of this city. Finally, becoming wearied
of the proceedings General Hart put his
trust in J. B. Wright of Sacramento and
left the account with him for settlement, j
[Uently Wright, being a railroad j
man. having common interests with Dan
lel M. Burns, a railroad candidate for the
United States Senate, met General Hart
and assured him that the matter would
ttled. Wright and Burns were con
stantly together, and doubtless while
Hart was awaiting the arrival of the for
mer's verdict he and Burns were joyous
over the shock such verdict would he to
Hart when made known to him. Finally
the limit of Burns' generosity and the ex
tent of his honor were made known to
Hart, and for some reason he agreed to
accept HoOOj held by Wright to be suffi
cient payment for the legal services. The
|ab< rs of Hart on behalf of Burns have
Epread themselves over many years now.
After saving the politician from the peni
tentiaryâa most difficult taskâ Burns gets
a henchman, binds Hart with a sacred
promise to agree to such henchman's ver
dict, fixes for himself the value of his
defender's services nnd takes the case
out Of court, but in doing so adds another
chapter to the history of his honor but
lit l l â¢- brighter th'nn tho rest.

A. O. H. BOARD OF ERIN.
The Annual Convention Is Held in
Crusaders' Hall.
The annual session of the State con
vention of the A. O. H. Board of Erin
was held in Crusaders' Hall, 1159 Mis
sion street, yesterday afternoon and even
ing, M. G. Sears, State delegate, presid
ing. After the transaction of routine
business the convention resolved itself
into executive session with J. J. Keating,
county delegate, in the chair. In view of
the fact thiit a general misapprehension
exists regarding the relation of the A. O.
H. Board of Erin to the A. O. H., resolu
tions were adopted defining the differ
ence between the two orders, the sub
stance of which was to the effect that
the A. O. H. in the convention of 1884 at
Cleveland practically declared themselves
seceders from the order; that while the
A. O. H. Board of Erin refused to admit
members unless they were natives of Ire
land or descended from natives thereof,
and who were Catholics, the A. O. H.
freely admitted descendants of mixed
(religious marriages and without regard
to nativity ot their parents, so long as
the father or mother could claim Irish
descent.
Before adjournment the chair an
nounced the deaths of M. McCabe of di
vision No. 7 and John Shea, former re
cording secretary, who was killed in the
Phihlippines while serving in the" United
States volunteers, and appropriate resolu
tions were adopted.

REASONS WHY A BIG
REQUEST WAS REFUSED
TRUSTEES OF ST. IGNATIUS
COLLEGE EXPLAIN.
They Regret That They Cannot Ac-
cept the Generous Gift of the
Late Mrs. Annie Donahue.
A great deal of surprise was manifested
yesterday by the parishioners of St. Ig
natius Cathedral and by the public gener
ally that the trustees of the college
should refuse the $100,000 legacy left them
by the late Mrs. Annie Donahue, widow
of Peter Donahue, to be used in founding
and supporting- for the benefit of Catholic
young men a library to be called in mem
ory of her husband the Donahue library.
The trustees' reasons for refusing the
large bequest were pertinent, and they
decided yesterday to inform the public
through the medium of the press just
what their reasons were. The following
communication to The Call explains their
action:
ST. IGNATIUS COLLEGE,
SAN FRANCISCO, May 20, IS9S.
The Editor of the San Francisco Call-
Dear Sir: As the public have learned
through the dally press, that the late Mr.-.
Donahue bequeathed 1100,000 to St. Ignatius
College in trust to provide a free library for
the Catholic young men of San Francisco,
and that the trustees of the oollege have
refused the trust, 1 beg to be allowed to
state the reasons of this refusal.
According to the will the trustees were
for this sum to furnish a site, to put up a
suitable building:, to equip a library and
either to provide themselves for its support
or else to form a society for this purpose.
Struggling as we are for bare existence. It
is clear that we could not take upon- our
shoulders the additional burden of the sup
port of such a library, supposing- that it
could have been established for the sura
bequeathed.
The alternative of forming a society for
Its maintenance seemed equally impossible.
To such a society the testatrix bequeathed
?5000. We should, therefore, have had to
solicit further subscriptions to a consider
able amount in order to obtain a capital of
which the income would be sufficient to de
fray the expenses of the library. This would
be to divert the funds necessary for our own
long-established work to a new one, which,
though most excellent in Itself, could not
have such claims upon our care. I
We deeply regret that the condition of :
our affairs forbade us to undertake this
charge so closely connected with the work
of education in which we are engaged, and
we hear with unfeigned satisfaction that
Mrs. Donahue's benevolent intentions are
not likely to be frustrated, but that â¢ the
Most Reverend Archbishop will In all prob
ability assume the trust Yours respect
fully, J. P. FRIEDEN, S. J.,
President Board of Trustees of St. Ignatius
College.

SOCIETY HAS
AN INNING IN
ST. SURE'S COURT
Pin-Holes and Grease
Spots Involved.
BANCROFT VS. HAMILTON
STAINS THAT WERE MADE BY
CHAMPAGNE OR BEER.
A Fashionable Whist Party and a
Maggoty Mouse Cut an Im
portant Figure in the
Case.
ALAMEDA, May 20.â Society had an in
ning to-day in Recorder St. Sure's court.
Questions involving' fashionable house
keeping occupied his Honor's attention.
The title of the case to which was at
tached so much that was important in
society circles was Sarah Bancroft vs.
Robert Hamilton. The plaintiff is the
wife of H. P. Bancroft, the head of a
school supply house in San Francisco, and
the defendant is a member of the firm of
Baker & Hamilton.
From the evidence it appeared that a
fashionable whist party was at the bot
tom of the whole trouble. The Hamil
tons came to Alameda to spend the win
ter months, and rented, furnished, the
home of Mrs. Bancroft, 1427 San Antonio
avenue. Mrs. Bancroft sued for $97 al
leged damages to the premises during
the Hamilton occupancy. Three broken
glasses, a smashed Mexican plaque, a
binful of coal left at the house for safe
keeping 1 and a missing bed comforter were
important items in the bill of particulars,
while grease spots on the carpets and
nail holes in the plastering were matters
of contention. There was weighty argu
ment as to whether certain stains on the
dining-room walls were made by spark
ling champagne or bubbling beer, and as
there was no expert testimony on the
subject the matter was left to the Judge.
The courtroom was comfortably tilled
with an audience representing society
circles of both sides of the bay. The
plaintiff, wearing a bonnet resplen
dent with yellow flowers and spangled
feathers, gave her testimony with much
positiveness and a decided touch of feel
ing.
"That binful of coal," she said, "was a
present from a former tenant, who paid
$4 for it, and Mr. Hamilton used it all
I up." Mr. Hamilton denied the impeach
'â  ment, and added weight to his statement
i by the assertion that he never built the
! morning tires.
Mrs. Bancroft described in detail 500
, pin holes in the walls of the spare room.
i for which Bhe made a charge of less than
1 cent per hole. The plastering in the
front room, she asserted, was frescoed
with pins, spikes and tacks.
When she told of the stains on the din
ing-room tinting she frankly admitted
that they were made by champagne, and
was apparently proud that she had had
tenants who could afford the luxury.
However, her husband was not inclined
to allow the defendant any such distinc
tion. ,
"The stains were made l>y beer. he
paid, and he curled his upper lip and ele
vated his nose toward the courtroom
ceiling. Mrs. Bancroft closed her testi
mony with a broadside aimed at Mrs.
Hamilton's reputation as a housekeeper.
"When I leased that house." she said,
"there was not a spoonful of dirt in it.
When they relinquished possession it was
simply awful. I never was In a dirtier
place in my life. I could write my name
in the dust all over the house, and In
the kitchen I found a trap containing a
maggoty mouse."
Mr. Bancroft went on the stand as an
expert on tlower gardens and expressed
the opinion that his wife's tenant had
attempted to raise a crop of hay on the
front lawn.
Captain J. S. Hanley, commodore of the
Encina] Yacht Club, was introduced to
give a professional opinion on grease
spots, and Colonel J. C. Bullock, county
expert, gave testimony on the value of
nail holes.
The defense offered much evidence to
show that the house had been well cared
for. Even the Chinese cook. Ah Charley,
was r.ady to testify that he had swept
it until his back ached. Mrs. Hamilton
explained how the trouble originated.
"When we were ready to give up the
premises," she said, "I sent for Mrs.
Bancroft to cheek off the inventory. 1
knew a few trifling things had been
brokt!i and I wanted to pay her for them.
She replied she had to attend a fash
ionable whist party and could not come.
That shows what kind of a business wo
man she is."
"Judge, I must reply to that!" shrieked
the plaintiff, jumping to her feet and ap
proaching the witness.
â¢'Sit down!" firmly commanded his
Honor, and the case proceeded.
Mrs. Alice M. Garrison- mother of Mrs.
Hamilton, insisted that her daughter was
a model housekeeper, and in this she was
corroborated by Miss Lillian Garrison,
Miss Anna Graves and Miss Fanny Ar
nold.
Judge St. Sure took the case under ad
visement and will probably consult with
several prominent society housekeepers
before he renders a decision.
An Aged Policeman Dies.
Harrison Moran died at his residence,
227 Duncan street, early yesterday morn
ing from a stroke of paralysis. He was
retired from tho police force last April
owing to incompetency. after serving
nineteen years. For a long time he was
stationed on Stanyan street, and was
well known to the frequenters of the park,
lie was 57 years of age.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 21, 1890.
SAN RAFAEL WILL BE
A GOLFER'S PARADISE
Team Matches Have Been Arranged
Between Ladies of Oakland
and San Francisco.
The council of seven which has man
aged the affairs of the San Rafael Golf
Club during the pasl year went out of
office yesterday. It was made up of
Ki< bard A. Parker (captain). Carter P.
Pom'eroy (vice captain). P. H. Green (sec
retary), Mark L. Gerstle, John J. Crooks.
Frank S. Johnson and James 11. YVilkins.
At iln annual meeting held yesterday at
the clubhouse in San Rafael the following
were elected to serve for the coming year:
Q. I. Poiheroy, F. S. Johnson, R. A.
Park.r. J. Glim an Brown. A. W. Foster,
Mark 1.. Gerstle and F. H. Green At the
first meeting of the council after the elec
tion the councilors will elect from their
number a captain, a vice captain and a
secretary treasurer. On the foundation
ol the club the entrance fee was $10, but
before the close of 1898 it was raised to
$25. The du.-s are Jlu per annum, payable
send-annually.
The old council during its year of office
was busily employed in securing land for
tiie links, laying out the course, getting
it into condition for play, putting up a
clubhouse and doing the necessary prelim
inary work. A temporary course of nine
holes has hitherto been used for practice.
but the eighteen-hole course ami all the
greens will be ready for play on June 5.
An instructor's house has been built,
which will be occupied by T. \V. Tetley.
who got back from Southern California
last Monday. It will comprise living
r<'oins and a repair shop. A rustic dining
room, large enough to seat forty-eight
persons, has been added on to the club
,house. It is no arranged that in warm
weather it can be entirely open at the
sides, while in cold weather it can be
inclosed. The new council, with the aid
of the instructor, will prepare a schedule
of events for the summer.
The regular programmes of the Oak
land and San Francisco clubs were prac
tically concluded yesterday; but the
ladies of the two dubs have arranged to
hold a series of tournaments to be con
ducted on the same plan as the home-and
home matches between 'the men. A
trophy has been procured, and matches
will be played on the links of the two
clubs alternately once or twice a month
during the summer. The first of the
series of matches will be held to-morrow
on the Adams Point links. The game will
be a nine-hole one and there will be at
least t'-n ladies on each side.

WHERE STRIPED BASS
ARE VERY PLENTIFUL
Anglers Who Have Taken the Game
Â§ Fishes by Trolling From a
Sail Boatâ Trout Fishing.
Anglers have been enjoying very pleas
ant outings on Lake Lagunitas during
the past week. On Thursday last a party
composed of A. Decourtioux, John Ker
, gez, John Siebe, John Lemmer, Dr. Mur
ray of San Rafael, John Butler and James
; Watt enjoyed first class trout fishing.
| Bergez lost a beautiful trout rod, it is
.-aid. owing to carelessness, but fortunate
ly John Lemmer, who was with Bergez
at the time the rod suddenly disappeared,
, recovered "the whip" from the bottom
1 of the lake by means of a grapple which
he constructed out of a few large hooks
which he discovered in a book that was
used in olden days when Lemmer was a
salmon fisherman.
The rod was seen on the bottom of the
clear water lake and after several at- I
: tempts tc fasten the grapples to the reel I
, it was finally landed on terra lirma. much j
i to the joy of its owner, who did not hesi
\ tate to open a bottle of Sonoma County
ink on the recovery of his favorite bam
j boo. Lemmer Is authority for the state
ment that a steelhead which happened
into the lake during one of the high win
, ter Hoods struck the little spinner which
Bergez was using at . the time and
i "walked off" with the Leonard fly caster,
which was not in the hands of the a*ngler
i when danger was near. Bergez will re
main by his rod in future when angling
for trout.
Butler did not catch anything larger
than an imaginary striped bass, which he
says afforded him much pleasure while
sleeping off the effects of an immense
, luncheon under the shade of a greenwood
tree. In an attempt to land the imagin
ary hsh Butler opened his little eyes in
; astonishment when he felt the cold moun
i tain water of the lake running into his
roe-colored boots, and then shouted "Save
me, John! Save me!"
Owing to the high winds that have pre
vailed for some weeks past the anglers
w.io visited Pilarcitos Lake returned dis
; gusted with their luck. Last Saturday
night two sport-lovers who were driving
to the lake met with an accident which
! fortunately ended with the smashing of
; a buggy. f When driving over the moun
; tain at night the horse made a misstep
and carried the conveyance and its oc
: cupants over a steep embankment. The i
, anglers and the horse escaped uninjured
but the wagon was badly disfigured.
Striped bass fishing has been fairly
. good during the week in the vicinity <<(
I the Oakland Long Bridge, but the strong
winds made angling anything but a pleas- i
! ure.
Several points in , the bay . have been
1 prospected by local anglers for the highly
prized bass since their arrival in the la"
--i goons and" estuaries has been made
known to the fraternity, but not until |
very recently have their whereabouts i
; been discovered by those who use the rod
and line solely for their capture. The net
fishermen have been catching large '
quantities of bass for some time along i
the bay shores between San Pablo and
Rodeo, and although local angelrs have
given the matter but very little atten
tion The Call can say and without fear
of contradiction that some of the resi
dents of Vallejo and Martinez have been
enjoying excellent sport trolling for li
king of Anadromous fishes between An
gel Island and Point Richmond.
Dr. Mulligan of Martinez and Edward
Colright are two of the successful and
painstaking anglers who "caught on" to
the real thing in striped bass fishing a
few weeks ago, and they are only too
anxious that their brothers of the angle
may share the pleasures and enjoyments
of real good sport. The fishes -can be
taken by trolling from a sailboat. It ap
pears that the bass is an exceedingly shy
fish and will dash away from the slight
est noise or splash, consequently a row
boat is not recommended for this kind of
sport.
The lislirs arc exceedingly plentiful in
the vicinity of Point Richmond and Red
Rock, and several large bass have been
caught by. the gentlemen already -men
tioned during the past month. A large
spoon spinning at least fifty yards from
the boat and tolerably deep in the water
has proved a very successful lure Dr
Mulligan contends that a tight line must
be kept on the fish when it strikes and
that the least slack during the time the
fish is making a fight for liberty will
prove fatal to the angler. The doctor lost
several fish while trolling for bass but
he succeeded, however, in landing quite
a few "whoppers." Local anglers who
are in quest of sport can now find the
pastime they have been so long anticipat
ing by engaging a good sized sailboat and
paying a visit to Point Richmond and
Red Rock.
Anglers and sportsmen will be delighted
to learn that the popular sportsman and
all-round good fellow. John H. Sammi of
this city, is a candidate for Fish and
Game Commissioner. It goes without say
ing that if the Governor will appoint Mr.
Sammi a member of the commission the
sportsmen and anglers of the city and
county will have cause to rejoice, as there
are none among .the handlers of the gun
and the rod in the State who have a bet
ter and more extensive knowledge of the
fish and game question than the gentle
man named. Protection to fish and game
will be Sammi's fight first, last and all the
time. His appointment is earnestly de
sired by those who have an interest es
pecially in the welfare of the game birds
and animals of the State, which, like the
buffalo, are fast disappearing.
The secretary of the Santa Catalina
Island Tuna Club. F. V. Rider, sends the
following communication to the sporting
editor of The Call, which is conclusive
evidence that the anglers of Southern
California are strongly in favor of pro
tection to game fishes. The writer says:
The Tuna Club will give an open rod and reel
fishing tournament at its fishing grounds, San
ta Catalina Islam], California, beginning with
the opening of the leaping tuna season, May 1
and continuing until September 1. when thirty
or more prizes in all classes will be awarded.'
The object of the tournament is to foster ana
encourage rod and reel fishing, thus securing
better sport, and to prevent the excessive
waste of came fishes that is a result of un
sportsmanlike methods.
In his annual report to the club the presi
dent will say:
"It affords me much pleasure to report that
as a result of the efforts and example of the
Tuna Club and its members unsportsmanlike
methods have to a large extent been elimi
nated from these waters. When a few years
ago one fisherman would by trolling with two
or three hand lines bring in forty or fifty yel
. lowtails, sea bass, etc.. magnificent fish - rang
ing from fifteen up to fifty pounds, which were
often towed out into the bay and thrown away,
â the same person will now, by using a light rod
be satisfied with six or eight, and as each fish
taken with the rod plays for twenty minutes
or more, the sport is greatly" increased. The
professional boatmen have heartily co-operated
In this work and now use the lightest tuna,
yellowtail and rock bass rods, lines, etc., and
the reckless, wanton waste of game fish is
rapidly becoming a thing of the past, a change
so marked that the members i f the Tuna Club
deserve the warmest congratulations from
lovers of true sport and humanitarians the
world over."
The officers of the club are:. Charles F.
Holder, president: E. L. Doran. vice
president; B. V. Rider, secretary: direct
orsâColonel C. P. Morehouse, Dr. H. K.
Macomber and T. S. Manning.

held. Antioch sportsmen are making very
extensive preparations to receive club
members and visitors. The programme of
events has already appeared in The Call.
As there are among the sportsmen a num.
ber of shooters who are fond of angling, it
has been suggested by a correspondent
that in the interest of various game fishes
lovers of shooting should kill a bird which
is commonly called shag or cormorant
(Phalacrocorax Graculus) whenever the
opportunity permits. The shag is a great
destroyer of young fishes, and as an or
nament or a table bird it is of no value.
The writer finishes his letter by stating
that as the sea linns must go, why not
kill off the shags also?

IMPRESSIVE CEREMONIES FOR THE OCCASION
Special to the Sunday CalL
LONDON, May 14.â When the long,
hard day of Queen Victoria's Dia
mond Jubilee was over she
summed It up by sighing, wearily:
"It makes me realize that I am a
very old woman." The multitudes
that saw her then realized It, too, and
their underlying consciousness of it did
more to make the occasion impressive
than all the trapping's ana the pageantry.
According to the dramatic fitness of
thinps this was the grand tableau before
tho fall of the curtain.
Rut the good Queen never has been in
the least dramatic, and she now ap
proaches the next moat Important mile
stone In her reign as calmly and comfort
ably as If she were to be 40 instead of 80
on the 24th of May.
It Is probable that the rather stuffy
room in Kensington Palace in which she
was born In 1819 will then be opened to the
public to signalize the occasion. Altera
tions and restorations have been going on
In the homely, squat old oullding for some
time In the leisurely British way. Accord-
Ing to present plans the Queen will give
In perton the drawing room to be held in
Buckingham Palace on May 16 and on the
following day she will lay the foundation
Btone for the new Kensington museum.
Cornerstones by the Hundred.
Again the story goes around that this
cornerstone laying will mark the last
puMic appearance of her Gracious MaJ-
Don't believe it. It will be an im
iressive occasion for the same underlying
reason that the Jubilee seemed almost pa
thetic; but unlees all present signs fall
the Queen will be able to pursue the chief
<',uelph diversion of laying cornerstones
uninterruptedly for an indefinite time to
come.
Victoria has undoubtedly laid more cor
nerstones and opened more Institutions
than any other person living; and the
Prince of Wales comes next. The Duke of
Y.Mk Is gaining on them a little, but he
b^pan so late that he can never hope to
catch up. Prince Edward, eldest son of
the Duke of York, and fourth In line to
tho throne, has not yet laid a single cor
r.e, but he must begin soon. It
seems probable that the great wall of
liOndon, now almost wholly lost to sight,
could be restored with the cornerstones
that have been laid by this family, and
the Lisbon earthquake probably didn't
y as much property as would tum
ble if all of these cornerstones were rude
ly withdrawn.
In Capital Candition.
This business of laying cornerstones
has been an outward and visible sign of
the reason for the Queen's long life. It
tie out of doors, and there is noth
ii:K unduly exciting about it. It is a solid,
â al occupation of the sort that
't prate on the nerves. If Charles I
I mtented himself with laying corner
-. all En.eiand would not have been
celebrating last week the three hundredth
anniversary of the man who ordered that
the royal head be cut off.
After the cornerstone at South Ken-
elngton is laid the Queen will go to Wind
sor, bringing to an end the gala days of
the tourists, who are permitted to ex
plore the castle and enrich the attend
ants when the Queen Is away. A stage
has been built in the Waterloo chamber
for the chief event of the Queen's birth
day, a performance of "Lohengrin" fol
lowing a big royal dinner party.
After her birthday the Queen will go
north to her favorite Balmoral, none the
worse, doubtless, for so hard a fort
night. Physically, she is not a day older
to-day than she was at the celebatlon of
her Jubilee, two years ago.
How She Keeps Young.
How does she do It? The court circular
for the outing In the South of France
tells part of the story. Every day, fore
noon and afternoon, her Majesty spent
every available moment In the open air,
driving about behind the royal horses, or
behind little Jocko, the celebrated white
donkey who has done practically all of
the Queen's walking for her out of doors
for 10, these many years. Whenever the
Queen goes for a "stroll" It is Jocko
whose fat little legs do the work, while
the Queen sits In the chaise.
When she goes for a "drive" the horses
honored with her confidence aro sae*e of
the most conservative beasts in Britain
having been tested with all sorts of
notses, from small boys with tin horns to
braes bands gathered in the Buckingham
Palace yard for the especial purpose of
seeing If they can frighten the horses. The
final stage in the training of these ani
mals is a course in bagpipes. If they can
hear bagpipes without so much as twist
ing an ear, then they are considered be
yond suspicion.
Eight of these horses went with Jocko
to Cimlez, accompanied by the Queen's
own carriage, and have not lacked for ex
ercise ever since. Rains are rare at this
season on the Riviera, but one or two
showers fell while the Queen has been
there, and on those occasions the natives
were astonished to see the Queen driving
out the same as ever. Her stay this year
has been prolonged unprecedentedly, so
she could be out of doors more than
would be possible in England's colder cli
mate.
How to Travel Comfortably.
The care that the Queen has been taking
to prolong her reign has been shown In
many other ways by Incidents of this out-
Ing at Clmlez, which has cost her about
$75,000, Including the expenses of her suite
of some fifty persons, and the $12,000
monthly rent of her wing of the Hotel
Regina. She sleeps better In her own bed
and consequently that cumbrous piece of
furniture went to Cimiez with her. She
finds delight In her dogs and birds, so
they went along. She hates the least bit
of a climb, so special platforms were con
structed for her by which she could step
from her train to the Dover-Calais steam-
er, and a special "lift" was built for her
at the hotels.
Wherever she went a small army of
watchers escorted her. Some were in of
ficial trappings; more were detectives In
citizens' clothing. Her path through
France was cleared of suspicious persona
by the establishment of a sort of "dead
line," like that once established by Tom
Byrnes around Wall street, beyond which
no crook might go without being arrested
on general principles.
The Queen Is now as careful about her
food as she Is about sleep and exercise.
And she comes nearer than, any other

member of her family to being a solace
and comfort to the total-abstinence peo
ple, for she takes nothing but a little
whisky and water for the stomach's sake.
She Is even more abstemious than the
Prince of Wales, who has lately foresworn
champagne, and now drinks little but
sparkling moselle. Besides the corps of
doctors of the household the Queen has
more than thirty honorary physicians and
surgeons. She is a great believer in med
ical advice, but not much given to taking
medicine. Open air is her sovereign rem
edy.
Eighty Years of Good Luck.
The Queen's luck has been aa proverbial
as the "Queen's weather," which, by spe
cial dispensation of Providence, is almost
Invariably fine whenever Her Majesty has
to make a public appearance. When she
was only clx months old an amateur
sportsman fired a shot through her nur
pery window that came within a hair's
breadth of her devoted head. When she
was thirteen a sudden gale arose while
she was at sea with her mother, and dis
lodged the topmast, which came crashing
down to the spot whence she had been
snatched by a pilot scarce a second be
fore. Five attempts to murder her have
been made without doing her more harm
than a bruise.
But the greatest luck of any was in
being: Queen at all and being: born on En
glish soil, for Victoria was only the niece
of William IV, and her father, the Duke
of Kent, woa only the fourth son of poor
old George 111. In the ordinary course of
nature she was many, many removes
from the throne, but she seems to have
had all the stamina that belonged to the
children of her father's 'Ider brothers, as
well as her own portion, for they dwindled
away as fast as they were born.
The Queen is German on her mother's
side and German a few removes away on
her father's Bide, and she would have
been born In Germany If her father had
not figured it out that his eldest child
might some day be the ruler of England,
and that It would therefore be well for the
infant's claims on the throne If He or she
first saw light In England. So, two
months before the expected event he hur
ried his Duchess away from her home In
I^elnlngen. There were no railroads In
those days, and it is said that the Duke
himself drove the coach from Amorbach
to the Dutch coast, for fear that a less
Interested coachman might drive care
lessly.
The room In Kensington Palaceâ ln what
is now the heart of fashionable Lon
donâwhere the future Queen was born
1b now being restored to look exactly aa
It did In 1819. The very pictures that hung
on the walls then have been brought back
from Hampton Court and are being put
In their old p"laees, and much of the origi
nal furniture will soon be ready for the
eye of the public.
The Coming Drawing Boom.
Buckingham Palace, Just below the op
posite end of" Hyde Park from Kensing
ton Palace, Is also being swept and gar
nished for the home-coming of the Queen,
and It Is probable that she will be pres
ent, for the first time In a year, at the
drawing room to be held there on May
15, thus making It a far more brilliant
affair than any previous drawing room
this year, for Princesses are too plentiful
to be of much value as a sole attraction.
This will be the first drawing room of
Embassador Choate and his wife, and
the ladies of the Choate family have Just
returned from Paris, where they have
been shopping for the great occasion.
Mr. Choate would have had a tough
time of it choosing among the American
applicants who wanted to be presented
at court as soon as It became known
that the Queen was likely to grace the
occasion in person were it not for the
fact that the lists were practically com
plete six months ago. Only the greatest
of the great could slip In at this late day.
It will not be known who are the lucky
ones till two days before the drawing
room Is held. The lists are never pub
lished long in advance, lest some one
might get the credit of presentation and
then evade the penalty and agony with
court dressmakers and tailors by not go
ing.
It may be said, however, for the bene
fit of those who are to be disappointed
when the lists are published that they
probably wouldn't have been presented
to the Queen in person after all; for, al
though she is astonishingly strong for a
lady of 80, Bhe is not inclined to stand
the whole ceremony of a drawing room,
and at best will receive In person only
the diplomatic circle, retiring then and
leaving some younger member of the
family to respond to the prescribed
obeisances of unofficial court society.
CURTIS BROWN.
Victoria's Perquisites
QUEEN VICTORIA is not only In re
ceipt of her annual income from the
people of Great Britain, but she is
entitled besides to a considerable
number of perquisites for the supply
of the royal household.
Among the most curious of these Is her
right to every whale or sturgeon captured
on the coast of the United Kingdom and
brought to land. Both of these perqui
sites date back to the days of the Nor
man Kings, and It appears that in the
case of the whale the monsters were dl
WONDERFUL HITS OF EXPERT SHOTS.
* GREAT deal of attention has been
/I paid of recent years to exhibition
A revolver and of attention has been
paid of recent years to exhibition
revolver and rifle shooting, and the
I t favor - with 1 which really % expert
~ a â *â¢ shots meet has greatly Increased
the number of extraordinary feats
which . can. now be performed with revol
vers and rifles. ;
"Buffalo Bill" was one. of the flnrt
shots ever seen In this country, although
exhibition .; marksmanship has " greatly
mproved since Colonel Cody last visited
England. If One of ? his most ' wonderful
!eats , was' not generally performed \ln
public, for the reason that its failure or
success could not be discerned at any
sxeat' distance. It consisted in driving
nto a white i board five short, flat-head- .
tacks with: five successive. shots, from a
ilstance just short enough to allow of
the tacks â  to be - accurately sighted, bo
?reat was Colonel Cody's skill with .tne
ight rifle he used for this feat, that given
favorable light he could generally per
form it six or seven times without a
miss. - .-â '..- â¢'.â '. ... â¢ . . ' â¢
â¢ Not only was Buffalo Bill's aim marvel
>usly accurate, but It was extraordinary
luick. , Given a repeater, he would stand
:>r sit on hi 3 famous white horse and
break five clay "pigeons" sent up simul
taneously before they had: time to get
more than a - couple of feet . on the â¢ fall
course. - ' â¢â  '" . '-â / - â  - : " 'â â â â  â ', â¢ â â 
But M. â¢ Bordeverry, a Frenchman, who
recently came to this country to show us
what a rifle could be made to do, would
probably give Colonel Cody points and
in easy beating. His accuracy and rapid
ty of aim are simply astonishing:. At a
listance of thirty feet he can cut a piece
it cardboard through the edge, as it is
poised upon the head of an assistant. At
i similar distance, leaning himself flat on
lis back over the seat of a chair, with a
pistol in his hand, he can send spinning a
threepenny piece which rests, naif hid-
Jen, upon his assistant's head. He will
tnock the ash off your cigar at a distance
>f thirty feet, or light your wax-vesta for
you, if you care to hold it. At ten yards
le can cut a swinging thread, and at the
same distance with three successive shots
he will ? pick off three small trifles bal
anced one upon the other upon the head
it his assistant. And to demonstrate his
vided between the rovereim and his con
sort, the Queen taking the head, in order
that her wardrobe might be replenished
with the whalebone needed for the stif
fening of her royal garments.
Another of the Queen's perquisites Is a
certain number of magnificent cashmere
shawls, which are dispatched to her every
year from the Kingdom of Cashmere.
They vary In value, as a rule, from
to $2000 apiece and the Queen Is accus- j
tomed to present one of them as a wed- I
ding present to every young girl of the
aristocracy In whose future she Is In any 1
way . Interested. Every tailor holding a 1
patent of "purveyor to Her Majesty," If |
he conforms to ancient tradition and I
usage, should present her with a silver t
needle each year. â 
Another class of royal purveyors Is |
called upon to present annually to her a Â§
tablecloth, while from other sources again I
she is entitled to an annual contribution ;:
of such varied "tips" as white doves,
white hares, firetongs, currycombs, scar- ;
let hosiery, nightcaps, lances and cross- .
bows. Â»-i
Moreover, at the coronation the Lord of jg
the Manor of Addington must present to V
the sovereign a "dish of pottage" com- *
posed of "almond milk, brawn of capons,
sugar, spices, chickens parboiled and
chopped." At the same ceremony the â 
Lord of the Manor of Haydon is obliged
by virtue of his. tenure from the crown
to present the monarch with a towel, the ;
Lord of the Manor of Worksop giving the
sovereign a "right-handed glove.".
Queen Victoria also has the privilege of
using any of the railways in the kingdom
free of charge. Her water rates and her
bill for gas, in the past, were nil, and she
has the right to "extort from every new
made knight the provender for five of her
household's help.
These, however, are only. a few of the
various perruisites to which the Queen of
England is entitled by tradition and us
age. .
A Clear Case.
A board of physicians were inquiring
Into the state of mind of an alleged luna
tic.
"You told us Just now," said the spokes
man, "that you were the Emperor Napn
leon and now you suy you are the Duke of
Wellington. Pray explain yourself."
"Quite right." returned the patient,
cheerfully; "that was by a different
mother."
They didn't ask any more Question*.â
Life.
I rapid Bight he will hit eleven distinct
bullseyes in seven seconds.
Revolver shooting is generally consid
ered to be infinitely more difficult than
I rifle firing, and there are certainly fewer
! expert revolver than rifle shots. Butj 1
among the most wonderful wlelders of the'
"shooting Iron" is an American gentle
man, a Mr. Stephens, with whom, how
ever, the fascinating practice la only a
pastime.
A very effective feat Mr. Stephens per
j forms privately consists of standing clx
lighted candles upon a bench, retreating
about forty feet, and putting out one can- I
â  die after another with the contents of his
: six-chambered revolver. On one occa
i ston the same gentleman, Btanding under
1 a cherry tree with a revolver In each
hand, cut the stones out of eight cherries
in eleven seconds. Of the two unsuccess
! ful shots fired, one only grazed the cherry
; it was aimed at and the other was lost
lin mystery. But the feat was a very
; wonderful one, especially for an amateur
I shot.

j falo Bill took with him to England,
was especially clever at it She wouid
; etand a few paces from a target and per
: forate the outer rim with shot so neatly
I that her name would appear quite dls
j tinctly designed by a series of clear-cut
holes.
On one occasion when Annie Oakley
was practicing: at a target she sent a
I shot right through the center of the bullst
eye. Some one standing by offered to
I wager her that she would" hot send a shot
I through the hole she had thus made.
Shouldering her rifle she fired four shots
I with great deliberation, and it was found
I that three of these mv.st have actually
; passed through the hole. Slightly enlarg
ing it, and the fourth had gone the eighth
of an inch off the mark. Five successive
shots hitting wuuin an area of hair a ,

As a rule the iguana makes a snapping
bite at the snake a few inches below its
head, and the latter instantly retaliates
by striking its enemy with its poisonous
fangs. Then an extraordinary thing hap

and straightway make for a kind of fern,

a fearful thing In the Arctic to be em
bedded by the ice. especially the young
ice, which every mariner dreads, it is so
sharp, and cuts both wood and steel.
"The captain stood In th.> crows-nest
at the masthead night ami day, shout-
Ing 'Starboard and steady' and then 'Port,'
and so on. working his way through the
field ice. The anchors were dropped and
hauled up like a pump handle to cut the
packlce, which waa six feet thick about
the bark. The crown of the anchor was
soon polished as bright as a new dollar.
"For days and days we watched for a
breeze, . and when at last through the
glass some one perceived a swell that
lifted the. great white plain into billows
from the southeast there was a shout
from th" sailors and a 'thank C-o<l' feel
ing from the hearts of us all. Within
twelve hours the southeast wind had
chopped the Ice up into small chunks and
we were, soon out of our difficulty.
"But the most terrible, storm that Cap
tain West ever weathered swoopoil down
upon us. off the coast of Japan less than
a year ago. It was a regular typhoon,
and we wore In the vortex of it.
"The waves broke right in on deck and
over the> stern and washed away a heavy
tool chest that had been lashed, ami two
of the boats on the cranes were smashed
and carried away. Oh, It was a terrific
sea. Our oil bags were all emptied to
flatten It. and the ship laid over with her
lee bulwarks under water. The barome

"When the ship hove down, if the wind
had not knocked the sea down, the Hora
tiao would have been dashed to pieces.
As it was we sprung the main topmast
and twisted the rudder-head off. Every
man was aft â nobody forward â ;uid the
sailors were lashed or had ropes about
their waists when venturing to obey or
ders. That's the worst strain when the
ship is hove down like that with the wheel
lashed. There's always danger of losing
her rudder.
"T'p to that time the wind had been
blowing from the southeast and the whole
main topsail was set In the calm between
the shifts of wind from southeast to
northwest. Then the wind came down
with all its force, 'butt end to.' as the
captain expressed It. It came so sudden
ly that we could not furl the sails, and
then we expected the mast to be carried
away.
"The captain had lashed me to a chair
below, because I insisted upon being near
him, and the fury of the storm made It

with poison from the repeated snake

When the lower main topsail, main spen

tain West came below and ordered me to
put on all the warm clothes I could wear
and to make haste about it. ' I was so
frightened that my fingers were numb,
but somehow I managed to put. on four
dresses over my bloomers. I knew with
out questioning that I was preparing for
an open boat In that awful sea. It was
blowing so hard that looking windward
we could see nothing but spray off the
top of the sea. That was the very worst
storm, but it suddenly left us. and the
Horatio, though badly strained, weath
ered the gale. .':
"Now comes the strangest part of my
whole experience, the part that almost
every one will say is too extraordinary
to admit of belief. From the time the
Horatio left San Francisco last Decem
ber I had a soul-pervading horror of be
ing shipwrecked. The great big dangers
that had jutted out on our horizon pre
viously 1 did not seem to fear, for T re
lied upon the captain's skill to evade
them. But the undeflnable. clinging pre
monition that we were to be in danger
when we lea.pt expected it filled me with a
fearful foreboding.
"This fear did not possess me until we
were crossing the bar. and I felt then
that the Horatio was on her last voy
age; that sho would he shipwrecked.
"The captain laughed at my supersti
tions, even while he respected them: but
the days went by, and as nothing oc
curred that was not anticipated. I, too,
began to doubt the prediction would come
to pas?.
"But one night I had a singular dream.
It was not the result of 111 health nor of
seasickness. Aboard ship 1 am not
troubled with Indigestion, so that the
dream and Its subsequent fulfillment was
altogether remarkable. Much of the vis
ion, of course, was inexplicable, but
enough of it portended the disaster which
actually happened to make me ever after
ward a believer in dreams.
"The pets whicli I took with me from
San Francisco were a canary, a rat ter
rier and a black kitten.
"The entire crew of thirty-six men
looked askance at the black cat and
shook their heads disapprovingly. Once
I heard a sailor say. 'Tret's throw it over
boaTd.'
"Well, in my dream I thought the Ho
ratio was painted yellow, just the color
of the canaryâ in fact the bark had sud
denly been metamorphosed into the bird,
and the cat sat on a rock splashed by the
sea. The cat's eyes seemed dilated and
steadfast, and I knew that it was charm

the victor had commenced Bwailowing his

Tfyis Jlmeriean Girl Save Up Christianity and Became a Swami.
Marie Louise Davitt, Who Was Once the Friend of Socialists Errjma Goldman and Justus Schwab, Is Now
on Her First Visit to India.
AMONG the passengers on board the
Peninsular and Oriental steam
ship Carthage, which arrived at
Bombay recently, was an Ameri
can lady of French extraction, who
is known as Swami Abhayananda,
and who is the first European, if we may
so call her, to be actually and practically
converted to Hindooism."
This little item, clipped from an English
newspaper, may recall to manyâ at least
those in any way interested in Theosophy
âthe very peculiar conversion, some four
years ago, of a woman to the Hindoo
faith, who preached and lectured in
Brooklyn, and who was known as the
"woman monk."
Bhe created quite a sensation at the
time of her first appearance, especially
as the public mind was rather prepared
for Theosophlcal discussion from its In
tense Interest in the Congress of Re
ligions held at the world's fair. Her mas
ter and teacher was the Swami Virlkan
anda, who was so prominent in Chicago
during the Exposition.
There Is little known of her to-day In
New York, though she was sn prominent
among the Socialists some ten years ago.
Justus Schwab, in speaking of her, said:
"She was a very fine woman, of an un
determined age, very homely, but very
intelligent. I have known Marie Louise
for twenty-five years, but, of course, all
interest in her ceased as soon as she took
up with Theosophy. She was of French
parentage, and spoke the language flu
ently, but she claimed to love America
better. She was very prominent at the
different liberal clubs, but, of course, that
is all over with now."
I found upon further investigation that
Bhe was a French woman, but natural
ized, and had been a resident of New
York for twenty-five years. She had rath
er a curious history. For a quarter of a
century she had been known as a ma
terialist, socialistâ some say anarchistâ a
friend of Emma Goldman and others of
that ilk. Twelve months before she be
came converted to Hindooism she was a
prominent member of the Manhattan
Liberal Club. Then she was known In the
press and on the platform as Mme. Maria
Louise, a fearless, progressive, advanced
woman, whose boast It was that she was
always in the front of the battle and
ahead of her times.
In an interview which she save the Her
ald in 1596 she pave the following as tho
Swami's fundamental teaching:
"Every man must develop according to
his own nature. As every science has its
methods so has every religion. Methods
of attaining the end of our religion are
called Yoga, and the different forms of
Yoga that We teach aro adapted to the
different natures and temperaments of
men. We classify them in the following
way, under four heads:
"(1) Karma Yogaâ The manner in which
a man realizes his own divinity through
works and duty.
"(2) Bliaktl Yogaâ The realization of a
divinity through a devotion to and love
of a personal God.
"(3) Rajah Yogaâ The realization of a
divinity through control of mind.
"(4) Guanna Yogaâ The realization of a
man's own divinity through knowledge.
"These are all different roads leading to
the same centerâ God. Indeed, the varie
ties of religious belief are an advantage,
since all faiths are good so far as they
encourage man to religious life. The moer
sects there are the more opportunities
there are for making successful appeals
to the divine instincts of all men."
In contemplating the step she had taken
and in considering the future this woman
has chosen to adopt, one can not but be
reminded of Schopenhauer's strange pre
diction when he said, in reference to the
ethics and philosophy of Hlndooism:
"The world is about to seÂ« a revolution in
thought more extensive and more power
ful than that which was witnessed by the
Renaissance of Greek literature."
During the time of the social furor cre
ated by the Swami Virlkanandi. when he
was the social lion of New York's Four
Hundred, after the Chicago Fair, the
Swami Abhayananda was at that time
earning her living as a journalist in
Brooklyn, and known as Marie Louise
Davitt. She was among the number of
those who were particularly impressed by
the philosophical doctrine expounded by
the young Bengali "Sunyasi."
She made a noint of attending his lec
tures, and after a full exchange of idi-as
she expressed her desire of becoming his
"chela." or disciple, with a'view of finally
adopting Hindooism. Then, carried away
by zeal, she asked for permission, and
was allowed, to enter one of the religious
orders of Shivaisen. that being the sect
of Hindooism to which her "guru," or
spiritual guide, Virikananda, belonged.
The latter "ordained" her in New York
In 1895, and subsequently at intervals
raised her through all the ranks of the
priesthood until she reached the highest
rung of the ladder, and was finally made
a "Sunyasi" of the "puri" order. As
such she is the very first of the Western
world, and. in fact, it sounds incompatible
âan American lady becoming a Hindoo
"Sunyasi." or "Yogi."
The lady Swami. if we may so call her,
is a little over HO years of age. stands
somewhat above the average height and
is of rather imposing figure. Her face
impresses one at the outset with its ex
pression of gentleness, calmness and kind
ness, but with these traits she possesses
the strong chin and massive jaw which
betray the dominant will power and in
vincible determination without which he
could never have crossed such a wide
social gulf as that which she has over
stepped.
She wears her hair, which is gray al
most to whiteness, cut very short and
brushed backward, a mode which shows
to advantage the breadth and height of
her straight forehead. Imagine her, too,
with a pair of dark eyes, full of earnest
ness, set in a face of a pale hue, and you
have a portrait of Swami Abhayananda.
According to the rules of her order, she
wears a simple cloth gown of saffron color
of a style modified to suit European con
ventionalities, but cut perfectly plain, like
that of a monk, and without any adorn
ment at all beyond a cash of the same

it with greater force upon the next rock.

" 'SouHd the pumps. Back all the yards

followed fast, and faster the bark glided
on to the reef.
"In less than twenty minutes after the
Horatio struck she lost her false keel.
The awful ripping, grinding and sizzine
will always ring in my ears. The signals
of distress were given, and though we
were two miles from shore the natives
saw out predicament and boats were soon
making out toward us.
"I went ashore in the first boat and
carried with me my pets, the trunks and
the two chronometers.
"It was quite dark before I stepped into
the lifeboat, and the fitful, sullen glare of
rockets across the water only intensified
the gloom. Mrs. Paulecksa, a native
â¢woman, kind-hearted and hospitable, took
me to her home and made me as com
fortable as possible. However, I spent
most of the night walking the beach,
waiting and watching until 3 a. m., when
the last boat left the wreck.

haunted by the memory of my dream and
its uncanny realization.

no. I am willing and ready to start on a
voyage to-morrow; but for the peace of
the crew I'll leave the black cat ashore.

roar of the grinding wreck I heard the
muttered imprecation, 'Curse that cat.' "

color carried around her waist and with
the ends hanging down in front of her.
Strange to say, after she was ordained
a priestess at New York in 1895 the lady
Swami collected a congregation around
her at the mission she started here, and
succeeded in converting a number of
American men and women to the Shivaite
sect of Hindooism.
The lady Swami is now on her first visit
to India. It is a matter of some specula
tion to see in what light the Hindoos of
India will receive Swami Abhayananda as
she goes about among them in her saffron
gown.
Bands on the Battle Field.
rr^HP: utility of music in matters per-
I taining to war is probably one of the
I greatest forces. At the present day,
"â â  in all the armies of the world, musical
war signals are considered not only use
ful, but absolutely indispensable. The in
fantry drill regulations of many countries
give the music and significance of more
than sixty trumpet signalsâ calls of nam
ing, of assembling, of alarm, of service
and so on â besides a dozen or more drum
and fife signals, all of which is a definite
language to soldiers.
But its use is not merely confined to sig
naling, for music is used in other ways
for purposes of war. In the way of dis
pelling weariness on the march, nothing i 3
equal to the music of a brass band. Lnr<l
"Wolseley, says Pearson's, has remarks, 1
that "troops that sing as they march will
not only reach their destination more
quickly and In better fighting condition
than those who march in silence, but, in
spired by the music and words of the Na
tional song, will feel that self-confidence
which is the mother of victory."
Probably savages are the most suscep
tible to the warlike feeling inspired by
certain class music. It arouses their an
ger, incites their fanaticism, and by ac
companying their war dances in time of
peace it arouses their lust of war. For
this reason it is among warlike nations
that early music was most developed.
The German army includes more thnn
ten thousand military musicians. Other
powerful nations on the Continent enplny
rather less numbera in military bands.

Belmont at Greenwich, Conn., although
the decree holds that her marriage In Mr.
Sloane's life is unlawful.
Three sessions were held before thÂ© ref
eree and six witnesses examined. Two
beautiful young daughters, Jessie, aged
15, and Emily, some years younger, were
given to the father.
Mr. Sloane accepted the conditions Im
posed upon him. In a letter to his attor
ney, which his attorney made public, he
scored his former wife in these words:
"In view of the circumstances under
which the deed was obtained I feel no
hesitation in taking a reconveyance of
the house, notwithstanding the removal
of many Valuable articles since I trans
ferred It and the exaction of a large sum
to pay private debts recently contracted
by her.
This transaction, therefore, Involved the
sum of $555.998 88, embracing the houso,
valued at IJiXi.OOO, the $75,000 mortgage and
Mrs. Sloano-Belinont's personal debts;
and the divorce and subsequent hasty
marriage Involved; besides this amount,
the {3,000,000 of Henry T. Sloane and the
$8,000,000 of Perry Beimont, making a to
tal of.SII.SSS.nOSB6.
Perry Belrhont's admiration for Mrs.
Sloane has. been for several years one of
the sweet morsels of gossip of New York
society, and it was expected by everybody
that after a year or two he would marry
the lovely divorcee. | The unprecedented
way in which matters were expedited was
unexpected, to say the least.
At 3:15 Friday afternoon, April 28, Mrs.
Sloane received the news that she was no
longer a wife. The hoodoo day of the
bride-to-be had no terrors for her. â¢ Half
an hour later she was told that Mr. Bel
mont was waiting in the drawing room,
and before the hand of the clock on the
great- staircase had marked another
quarter of an hour the couple left the
house and wore driven to the station. At
7 o'clock that evening they were made
man and wife by the Rev. Walter M.
Barrows, pastor of thÂ© Second Congrega
tional Church at Greenwich, Conn.
The ceremony over they drove to the
station, took the first train for New York,
and at 11 p. m. departed for Washington.
There is another detail of the story yet
to be recorded. It refers to the home
that belonged to Airs. Sloane. now Mrs.
i'clmont, 9 East Seveutyrsecond street,,
which was transferred to her last Octo
ber by Mr. Sloane. Before she left the
city she convoyed the house and its con
tents, together valued at $550,000, to the
State Trust Company, with instructions
to convey it back again to Mr. Sloane..
If at the end of ninety days he shall not
have accepted the deed. Mrs. Belmont di
rects that â¢ the bouse shall be. sold and
the proceeds of the sale kept In trust for
her children. â¢
Very unlike the second marriage of this
beautiful woman was her first to Henry
T. Sloane some fifteen years ago. It was
not dreamed by the onlookers then that
some day the principals' in that sumptu
ous wedding feast- would be the principals
in a cause celebre that would stir the so
ciety folks of this country. Mrs. Slnane
was" Jessie. Bobbins of Brooklyn, a dainty,
ethereal beauty, with gentle" manners .-mil
an amiable disposition. With instinctive
tact she. became a leader irr sockty and
made friends everywhere. The couple
seemed most . happily mated. Henry
Sloane, somewhat of a recluse before his
marriage and a devotee to business,
changed perceptibly under the gracious
influence of J hie wife. He went with her
into society and encouraged her by his
wealth and his presence in making for
herself one of the most enviable posi
tions amorg the Four Hundred of the me
tropolis. When children came to bless
the union, the husband lapsed back into
his quiet ways, and his old. love for busi
ness grew stronger as he grew older.
Gradually the breach between the two in
creased.- ai il thai it was never closed is
proven by the climax. '
Her husband's -Immense wealth had
provided her with jewels that outshone
those of almost any woman of her ac
quaintance and she became known as the
best gowned woman of her set. Under
the direction of Mrs. Jacob Astor and
Mrs. '"-'' n Mills, her boson friends, Mrs.
Sloane became a leader, and in that so
cial quarrel as to who should wear the
mantle of Mrs. Astor. Mrs. Sloane was
selected to represent her coterie.
While Jessie Kohbins Sloane flitted
about the gay mazes of social affairs, her
husband watched from afar, Quarrels
arose followed by reconciliations which
were broken by renewed quarrels. Other
men admired the . beautiful young wife,
and suspicion lurked in the breast of the
husband. The Sloane set .gossiped about
the separations between the two that
lasted for days nnd weeks, and finally be
came permanent. It is said that It was
at Newport last August that Mr. Sloane
found confirmation for his suspicions. II
was whispered about Newport that Mr.
So-and-So had fallen from his wheel anr
been badly battered and bruised aboui
the head and face. Then came the an
nouncement that Mr. and Mrs. Sloan*
had separated lor good. She went to tin
town house of the Sloanes and the hus
band took quarters at the Buckingham
Hotel. The "two girls were left with th<
mother. Â
Rumors came out from time to tim<
that there would be a reconciliation, bu
they were never verified. Instead, sul
was filed for divorce. Nobody knew of i
until it was granted and followed imme
diately by tho remarriage of the divorce*
and her present husband. Thus ends thi
chapter of the separation of the Sloanes
Besides her children, Mrs. Sloane had al
so to give up her dower rights. But thi
latter clause ought not to distress Mrs
Belmont. â¢â -"â " ' '

had assailed me, exposed as I had been
all day to the burning rays of the sun,
and I now felt my tongue swollen to
such an extent that it seemed to fill
my mouth. I could not summon a par

"The night paused thus. When day
dawned I still held the pick and my
nerves had somewhat recovered their
normal condition. It was then that I
contemplated, for the first time, the
possibility of cutting steps up the al

"How did I set about it? I struck
the pick by a backward blow of my

self of its weight and at the same time
freeing my right hand. I then slowly

SOCIETY DIVORCES
IN
New York.
FIFTY years ago we were a simple
peoplÂ« in very fact. To our grand
fathers and their fathers the mar
riage service really meant the
union of two lives. Divorce was
practically unknown. They took
each other for better or for worse, and
they thought and prayed before they
made these solemn vows. Having made
them, they lived up to them, or If they
did not they were properly held up to the
contempt of the community.
Once In a lifetime, as In the case of the
Sickles tragedy, a weak woman fell. Then
her husband shot the man, put tha woman
away from him, according to Biblical or
ders, and society applauded, though it
took It years to recover from the shock
of tha Sickles divorce case.
Then came the Beecher-Tllton divorce.
It resulted In tha immolation of the
woman, thÂ© exiling of her husband and
general desolation for all concerned. That
divorce shook thÂ© American nation from
center to circumference.
The Coleman Drayton divorce., with Its
scandalous revelations, brought the fair
est and first family of the country Into
the Divorce Court Mrs. Coleman Dray
ton was Miss Charlotte Astor, a daughter
of Mrs, William Astor.
The social world stood transfixed at the
thought of an attack upon a woman of
the Astor family. Without more than a
casual reference to this painful case, it
may be said that its prominence and the
sequel to the divorce, the remarriage of
Mrs. Coleman Drayton to Mr. Halg of
England and the acceptance of that lady
socially by the highest dignitary of the
church when she returned to America as
the bride of Mr. Halg, did more to ad
vance the laxity with which the marriage
tie was afterward regarded than any
other social incident of the century.
Sober-minded men and women recall
Ward McAllister's statementâ and what
ever may bo said as to his worldllness. it
is certain that no one- better knew his
metier than the creator of the Four Hun
dred.
"Society," said Mr. McAllister, "la
founded upon the sacredness of the home
and family ties. Divorce destroys the
home. It would destroy society wera a
married divorcee ever to be accepted as
a leader."
But the deadly upas tree waa already
thriving. And society has nourished it
with prodigality. To-day it overshadows
the law and the gospel. Looking without
preiudlco at the condition of New York
society to-day one finds that In scarcely
one prominent family Is the divorce court
unknown territory-
First of all, the Astors. Mrs. William
Astor, who was so stern in her disap
proval of divorces that she would not re
ceive a divorcee In her drawing room,
now finds herself obliged to admit and
accept women who have followed in her
own daughter's lead. When Mrs. Wil
liam Astor gave a dinner party for her
daughter. Mrs. Haig, and Bishop Potter,
the head of the church of the diocese or
New York, and his wife accepted an in
vitation to that dinner, the social doors
were thrown open to divorced men and
women.
Next to the Astors the Belmonts have
been regarded as social powers. Third in
importance come tbe Vanderbllts.
Before society had recovered from tho
sensation produced by the c'oleman Dray
ton incident Mrs. William K. Va.nderbilt
treated the world to a series of surprises.
Mrs. Vanderbilt, without any opposition
rrom Mr. Vanderbilt, secured a divorce
from her husband on statutory grounds.
Mr. Vanderbilt settled $5,000,000 or $6,000,
--uuo upon his former wife, with yearly ali
mony of JL'OO.OOO. With her freedom from
the marital bonds she thus became one of
the richest unmarried American women.
-iV-iii- n a few months the eldest child of
William i K. Vanderbilt, Consuelo, became
the bride of the Duke of Martborough,
whose mother, the Marchioness nf Bland
fdrd, had obtained a divorce from the
Duke s father, also on statutory Krounds,
and who has lived in seclusion "ever since.
Mrs. \ anderbilt almost immediately after
her daughter s marriage became the wife
of O. H. P. Belmont.
O. H. P. Belmont waa a divorced man
116 - Hls wlfe was 168
Sallle Whiting. She obtained a divorca
from O. P. H. Belmont and the cus
tody of their only child, a daughter who
is now a young woman.
Shortly after securing her divorce Mr
Belmont's first wife married Mr. Georga
M. Rives, a wldowar, whose first wife
was a Miss Schermerhorn, a niece of Mra.
Astor. The Belmonta, Astors and Van
derbllts have long been intimate friends.
The older members of the family made
up the first great social triumvirate. The
Vanderbilt divorce was the first actual
break in the trinity.
At the time of the Vanderbilt divorce
Mrs. George M. Rives, formerly Mrs. Bel
mont, was very lntJmate, as she 1b now,
with the Astors.
Mrs. Orme Wilson, formerly Carrie AÂ«
tor, and the present Mrs. Bivea are inti
mate friends. Mrs. Wilson 18 the sister
in-law of Mrs. Ogden Goelet. and Mrs.
Ogden Goelet is a slater of young Mra.
Cornelius Vanderbilt. The Cornelius
Vanderbilt Jrs. are ostracised by the re
mainder of the Vanderbilt connection,
and the patient reader who chooses to do
so may amuse himself by untangling the
complication that followed.
Mra. O. H. P. Belmont, formerly Mrs.
W. K. Vanderbilt, was in maiden lire Miss
Alva Smith. Her sister Jennie married
Fernando Yznaga, brother of the present
Duchess of Manchester. Society waa de
lighted and came to the wedding with Its
congratulations. Then came the divorce,
and Mrs. Yznaga shortly after married
Mr. AVillie Tiffany. Society gaily con
gratulated some more.
Then Fernando Yznagra, Mrs. Vander
bilt-Belmont's former brother-in-law,
married lovely Mabel Wright, and soci
ety, nothing daunted, again congratu
lated.
The second Mrs. Yznaga went to Sioux
City and got a divorce ana" married Count
Bela Zichy. Socletv looked a little daaed,
but came to the tront again with jfood
wishes.
Clara Stephens when she married "Wil
lie Havemtyer was congratulated with
special heartiness. The Havemeyers are
another excellent family. But Mrs. Wil
lie got her divorce and married Jack
Bloodgood.
About this time the Dakota divorce
broke with terrific force over the smart
world. Women of fashion disappeared
for a brief time and returned from the
West rejuvenated In appearance, and di
vorced, of course. The upas tree put
forth not only new leaves, but whole
branches of rank foliage in scandal and
accusation. The situation, once painful,
grew finally to he regarded as a never
failing subject for jest. Men and women
of fashion gave up the task of trying to
Invite to their homes people who were not
Involved in divorce and remarriage com
plications. At the Vanderbilt-Fa!r nup
tials there were assembled under one roof
plaintiffs, defendants, ex-wives and ex
husbands in hopeless but undaunted con
fusion. The Astor-Vanderbilt-Belmont-
Sloane tangle had to be unraveled in ;:!1
its complications. Tho seating cf the
guests at that wedding breakfast was a
feat worthy of Alexander the Great.
Then came the last big rent In divorce
society. On April 28 Mr. Henry Sloane,
at 4 o clock In the afternoon, was avrard
ed a decree of divorce from his Wife,
Jessie Robbins Sloane, with the cuutody
of the two Sloane children.ODD VOCATIONS FOLLOWED AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY.

JV ss Tweed was 'It' In New York, and
7-hr-n the situation in the big town was
such that police officials had a good deal
more intimate knowledge of the doings
of professional criminals than they have
nowadays. Here's the story that the
sight of the old vag recalled to me:
"One day In the autumn of IS7O 'Little

and successful bank burglar who ever
worked a drill in this country, was walk

role and the mellow sunshine. There were
a whole lot of Indictments hanging over
him, of course, but the indictments didn't
worry 'Little Johnny.' for he happened
to be on pretty fair terms with the mu
nicipal administration at that time. As
'â  swung along he was accosted by a
' rous-looking man whom he did not
know, although the man addressed him
*3 'Mr. Hope.' 'Little Johnny' took the
itranger into a cafe and asked him
things.
" 'In the first place, how did you know
me?' ho inquired of the. stranger.
""Well, it appeared that 'Little Johnny'
had been pofnted out to the stranger by
a detective who was so shady that he
afterward did time for secretly 'extend
ing aid and succor to the enemy'â i. c.. a
famous band of New York crooks.
â â¢ 'Well,' said 'Little Johnny' to the
stranger, 'I don't suppose you're seeking
my acquaintanceship for the sake of being
introduced into society or for the enjoy
ment of my winning ways. What's your
graft?) :.'.^ :^,,:' / -^v
"Then the stranger 'up and told' him
his 'graft' was.

country,' said he to 'Little Johnny' Hope.
'The directors don't know anything about
It, but I'm, short in my accounts. There's
only one way out of it. The benk*ll have

Equally remunerative are the univer

On the campus Is a Western Union
Telegraph office and a Sunset Telephone

they make about $15 a month apiece.

meantime Hope looked into the job. He
found that his man really was the cashier
of a prominent bank in a town not more
than half an hour's run from New York.
So when the cashier called upon him at
the appi Â»nted time hÂ« was ready to talk
business.
" 'You'll have a hard night's work,' said j
the cashier, 'for in order to avert suspi- !
cion I'll have to leave the vaults and safe
all locked up tighter'n a drum, as usual.
You'll need several assistants."
" 'You just pass those details up to me,'
replied Hope. 'Every man to his trade.
They don't make 'em so strong that I
can't get into 'em.'
"Thrn all of the details were arranged j
and the robbery was fixed for a certain i
night in the following week. The cashier j
was especially solicitous that he should i
get his share of the proceeds of the crib
cracking. Hope assured him that if there
was $35,000 in the job $25,000 would be'
enough for himself and his assistants and
ih<- cashier would get the rest.
"On the night fixed "itttle Johnny' and
three of his best men went up to the
town and pulled off the Job. It was a
matter of four hours before the gang,
after overpowering and tying and gag
ging the night watchman, got into the
main safe. They found it empty. They
then tackled the smaller safes. These,
too, were empty. 'Little Johnny' was
mad, as can be readily imagined.
" 'It wu the first and last time I ever
played the part of a "good thing" In a
job like that,' be said afterward,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 21, 1899.
A young lady student Is employed In
the poptnffict- at a fair salary.
Within the gift of the student body are
several remunerative offices. They are
elective, the elections being: held near the
close of each semester". The Australian
ballot system is need, the university cata
logue answering' for a great register.
The campaigns are often sharp, with
every now and then an election fraud to
lend a reality zest to college politics.
The most desirable pay position la that
of student body treasurer. It is worth
$000 a year.
Next are the newspapers, the Daily
Palo Alto and the Weekly Sequoia. The
editor and business manager of the daily
are elected seml-annually; of the weekly
once a year. The raliA of the offices de
pends on the business managers. If they
are good rustlers the jobs are each worth
from $30 to SCO per month, the editors get
ting two-fifths and the business managers
three-fifths of the net proceeds. There is
considerable honor and good experience
attached to these offices.
In connection with the newspapers
there are six solicitors, three on each
publication, who make about $10 each per
month.. There are two carriers on the
daily, who make $10. and on the weekly
one mailer, who is paid $4.
During the first three months of the fall
semester there is a football manager, who
is paid $70 a month. The expenses of the
office are as -high as its honors, so the
chief remuneration is glory.
In the departments of instruction a
good many students find employment.
First stands the library, with five stu
dent assistants, each receiving $20 per
month. This is considered one of the best
"Now. that was pretty clever work on
the part of the cashier, wasn't It? He
had simply looted the bank himself, and
the robbery which he had . arranged was
simply to cover up his trail. There have
bpon 'Napoleons of finance' without num
ber developed from the ranks of bank
cashiers, but I never heard of a cleaner
bit of work than that. It was, I think, a
bit of absolute genius.
"Of course. 'Little Johnny' and his as
sistant? had only to pack their tools and
get back to New York. They weren't In
a position to say anything about how they
had been fooled. 'Little Johnny' had to
read in the afternoon papers the account
of how the bank had been robbed of cash
and securities 'approximating $100,000 in
amount," and grind his teeth. The bank's
failure was announced a few days later.
"Two months after that it fell to my lot
to handcuff myself to 'Little Johnny' and
to take him up to Sing Sing on a New
York Central train. One of the Indict
ments against him was pressed for some
reason or other and he got a five-year
stunt. The train we took for Sing Sing
prison was a local affair, and It stopped
at all the little stations. 'Little Johnny,'
who sat next to the window, looked Idly
out at the loungers around the stations.
At one of the stations not far from Sing
Sing I noticed his face suddenly darken
with rage, and I asked him what was up.
He pointed out a slick-looking man who
was sitting in a dogcart beside the sta
tion, and he cursed him in a blood-curd
ling way before he was able to tell me
the story I've told you. The man in the
dogcart was the cashier who had been
crafty enough to put it all over 'Little
Johnny' Hope, probably the most wily
criminal in his particular line who ever
operated in this country. The failure of
the bank hadn't hurt the cashier at all
in the estimation of his townsmenâ bank
was robbed b" cracksmen, y 1 see, and
how could the cashier help it? Oh, that
cashier was good, all right.
"Well, it wasn't up to me to say any
thing about what 'Little Johnny' had told
me, although I frequently saw the cashier
flying high in New York after that. 1
lost track of him after a couple of years,
however, and concluded that he had
struck out for the West or somewhere
or another with his beautifully contrived
rakedown from the bank.

The chemistry department gives six stu

for work done In the laboratories. In the
physiology and zoology departments two
students make $10 to $15 per month each,
caring for the demonstration rooms.
The geology department has one stu
dent earning $15 to $20. caring for speci
mens. Both the geology and physiology
departments have a student instructor,
who receive $30 a month iii each case. In
the history department two stenograph
ers are employed, and advanced students
make several dollars a month examining
and marking "ex." papers and making
maps. The economics and education de
partments each employ stenographers,
who are paid $15 a month apiece.
A large number of students are em
ployed in coaching or tutoring. The work
brings in about $10 or $15 a month while
it lasts, but the employment is erratic.

A most remarkable occnrrenoÂ« took place 1b Kelssy Greek, ILake County, last week. Every spring a species of fish called the hitch rv.n ap from Clear TaTt*

The rains of week before last flHed the creek banks full and the fish made their annual pilgrimage, but on attempting to return to the lake they were strand

Hundreds of people were attracted by the unusual sight and the neighboring farmers hauled them home by the wagon loads and fed them to the hogs.

All this work Is desirable and hence the
competition is great. . Especially is the
university stocked with typewriters and
stenographers and persons wishing to do
clerical work. â¢ ; â  , :
The employment outlined so far Is only
such as one would naturally suppose was
being done, but when' we step out into
the realm of odd jobs we find to what
straits student Ingenuity is taxed to
make ends meet, frayed though the ends
may be. ; ' :
The work about to be considered is the
j "real thing." and it is the test as to how
much a person Is willing to put up with
for the sake of an education. The situa
tion of Stanford is well adapted to . ad
vance student employment, being distant
from any city of any. consequence, so, as
the institution grows, the opportunities
for work will increase. The bane of
student employment in the past has been
incompetency, which gave student labor
a bad name; but by the system at present
In vogue of tabooing- any incompetent
person' confidence is being restored.
Last year, under the direction of Pro
fessor M. R. Smith, an Information office
for student labor was established, and
while the arrangement has not been so
, successful this year because- of .the ab
sence of Mrs. Smith, with her return next
fall It. will be readjusted. The aim of the
i office was to supersede the methods of
assisting ' students by personal interven
tion on the part of the employers .and
solicitation ,on the part of the student,
with a central office, where all who desire
work can register and all who want work
ers can apply. The students fill, out the

The person in charge of the registering
then marks an A or B or C after each
kind of work checked, indicating the ap
plicant's proficiency as nearly as can be
ascertained by questioning. Then, when
requests for student labor come in a
suitable man is found, the employment
being divided as evenly as possible among
'.;. bi registered.
The rate paid for the work is 15 or 20
cents an hour, and it is a fact that the
supply of labor is not adequate for the
demand. There is very little competi
tion between the men and women. Of the
forty-three kir.ds of work in the list but
sixteen are applicable to women and there
is a constant undersupply of women
workers.
The majority of the workers among the
m< n reside in The Camps, a barrackslike
row of frame buildings back of the
â¢â¢quaii." There are forty rooms which rent
for $2 each a month. The majority of the
men "batch" and so live on $12 or $15 a
month.
j Other students club together and hire
a studev.t cook. This scheme costs little
more and the food obtained Is more pal
atable â  and healthy. Most of the work
comes from the triple row of professors'
residences and fraternity houses east of
The Camp. After a man has made a
reputation he has all the work he can
do. One student last year arrived In The
Camp with just five cents In his pocket
and returned home In the spring with $65.
There are a number of instances where
students have had only $10 or $15 a year
outside assistance. The work that The
Camp boys generally do is included in
the list under the headings: Carpenter
work, gardening, house-cleaning and mis
cellaneous, and it is done principally In
the afternoons or on Saturdays.
But this is not by any means all the
work carried on. One student makes con
siderable taking photographs and an
other by doing scientific drawing.
Toward the close of each semester stu
dents organize transfer companies and
vie with each other In getting: contracts
for taking trunks to Palo Alto.
One- student solicits jobs of pressing and
mending for a tailor shop.
The.-c are a number doing cuores for
their board, and one student cooks and
does housework for a family of two.
A couple of students were engaged fnr
a while hauling and laying brick. At the
beginning of each semester there are odd
jobs at the University book store, in the
president and the registrar's offices and
occasionally during the year In the
library.
The drawing department spends about
$">0 a month for student employment. One
m.in cares for the studios and several
pose for the life and portrait classes.
Here is where a good figure is more than
a thing of beauty to the owner. Posing
requires nerve and patience, but It pays
well.
Another unusual way of making money
is scraping and mounting skeletons for
the zoological department, and still an
other is providing subjects for dissection
in the physiology and zoology labora
tories. v -->.;"'
Students go out and shoot or trap squir
rels, jackrabblts and birds and catch or
lasso dogs and cats. They receive 25
rents apiece for each subject. Conse
quently there are few animals In the. Im
mediate vicinity of the campus, and pet
dogs have to be tagged and closely
guarded. Not Infrequently frat brothers
or sorority sisters are horrified to see
their especial pet opened out before a
science class to demonstrate the Internal
mechanism of the quadruped, and when
ever a pet animal is missing In Palo Alto
the owner knows where to findâ his re
mains.
At least six students earn their entire
way by collecting marine forms and zo
ological specimens for the Eastern col
leges. They receive S2O for e%*ery collec
tion. This method is open only to science
students and upper classmen.
So far little has been said abont the
employment of women. They work at
occupations In the list under the heads of
general housework and clerical work.
There are several girls taking economics
and sociology as their major study, with
the Idea of some day having charge of a
publlo Institution. They are working their
way through and doing house and other
similar work from choice, because of the
experience gained thereby.
One young lady earns her way by mak
ing girls' "gym" suits. Roble Hall fur
nishes employment for one girl as door
keeper.
A favorite employment with the women
Is music-teaching of all kinds, and one
young lady teaches a private school In
Palo Alto. Tliis work, after a class la
started, is genteel and lucrative. Uni
versity girls have made considerable aa
organists for the various churcaes in the
towns around about the campus, and
others furnish music for private parties.
These, then, are the schemes by which
Stanford students work their way through
college and earn in the aggregate $3300
per month. For a student to succeed in
this life he must have a level head and a
good constitution. IU- mu9t veneer his
sensitiveness with good common-sense
and be able to endure many hardships.
There Is no romance in working your way
through college, and little pleasure, un
less you enjoy hard work and do not
allow little things to worry you. A stu
dent working his way has to compete in
his elapses with students who have noth
ing to do but study.
Students taking scientific or engineering
courses have their afternoons token up
with laboratories, and are still further
handicapped by having studies that re
quire long, persevering application rather
than especial genius. Resides, these
courses are expensive, requiring labora
tory fees and instruments. Tn every case
It is the best adapted who have best suc
cess.
After it is all through with and the stu
dent holds In his hand the coveted
diploma, ask him If he thinks it was
worth the while. His answer will depend
upon his temperament, but the chancea
aie that he will say he Is glad, now that
it is over, though he doubts if he would
have the nerve to do it again, and he ad
vises others to earn at least a part of
their expenses beforehand.
It won t do for a pessimist youth to at
tempt the feat. He is sure to become
"sauerballed." as the saying is, and grad
uate with a disposition that eminently fits
him for chief tester at an acetic acid fac
tory; but for the boy with plenty of pluck
and good health and a cheery state of
mind, why. come on and try.
A rat's tail Is a wonderful thing. The
great naturalist, Cuvier, says that there
are more muscles in this curious append
age than are to be found in that part of
the human anatomy which is most ad
mired for its ingenious structureâname
ly, the hand. To the rat, In fact, Its tail
serves aB a sort of hand, by means of
which the animal is enabled to crawl
along narrow ledges or other difficult
passages, using it to balance with or to
gain a hold. It Is prehensile, like the
tails of some rnonkeyÃ. By means of it
the little beast can Jump up heights
otherwise inaccessible, employing it as a
projectile spring.

officer, a Korninsan. who spoke English and French fluently
ho sometimes was called Maclean and at other times Van

n;n and I determined to see and speak with him.
The first time I f=aw Maclean was at Cavite. Later on 1
visited him at Bakor, on the staff of Aguinaldo. After talking
with him a dozen time* I was apparently no nearer his confidence than
before I had met him. He was a man upon whose face was written un
told suffering. He had received a very good education and had a splendid
military knowledge. He despised his surroundings. The only man to
â whom he seemed a comrade was an educated Tagallo, Alexandrino, an
adjutant, and one in whom Aguinaldo placed undoubted confidence.
Alexandrino's was a dark nature, "a fellow for conspiracies and
crimes." He said to me once, "This country is doomed to years of war,
and It Is better so, we will be rid of a surplus population."
I saw no more of Maclean, or Van Ix>o Tat, until one day after the
capitulation of Manila, when Surgeon Whiting, in charge of the smallpox
hospital, came to me with the news that a friend of mine, one of Aguin
aldo's officers, was dying and wished to see me.
When I came to the cane cot Maclean feebly held out a hand and
gradually drifted into the chief story of his life.

"Takp this glass, sir, and you'll see the lee quarter boat davit tackles

Captain Image. "Nasty things, those old wind jammers, Mr. Strake.

"But there's a pile of money in her still," said the third mate, follow

Strake drummed at tho white rail of the bridge. He was a very young

to sit beckoning him. "I've been thinking, sir, if you could lend me half

"I'm as likely to lend you half a dozen angels. Look at the deck

"Old man's mad at losing a nice lump of ealvage," thought Strake.

to the father. The old man was indignant. He delivered himself of a long
tspeech against the outside .world In general and the Japanese In par
ticular.
His venom was directed against my clothing, the manner of dressing
my hair and my unnecessary accomplishments. He criticized my father,
anil hnally wound up by denying me the girl's hand unless 1 became one
of his tribe and dropped entirely the ways of civilization
I loved the girlâ Geta was her nameâ with a wild passion that may
not be described. For many days I brooded upon the condition, and then
C j m , P - t " tht ' conclusion that once she was my wife I could flee to Tamsul
and defy the old man.
* .'L Th< \ ! Vr- xt day 1 lald aside the clothing of the white man and the ways
of the civilized. I donned the tribal headband and assumed a position of
authority as the chiefs nephew.
"Having complacently demeaned myself to suit his pleasure I now de
manded the girl of my uncle. We were sitting before a flro from which
at win he brought by passing his hands over it red, green or yellow names.
_Ile turned his hideous, parchment-like face toward me and said:
1 mi masquerade well, my nephew, but there Is one condition you
must fulfill. Remember that you must bring in a head, the head of a
Chinaman, ere you can claim my daughter!'
Filled with horror at his demand I made a mute appeal to the
daughter.
"I am my father's daughter,' she said, looking deflantlv at me, 'and
you are a Japanese coward. Conform to our tribal customs, become a true
man, and I will be yours. You had better go at once. Go!"
"After T had left that old devil at his mysterious fire and wandered Into
the moonlight, I broke into a run down the mountain path toward civiliza
tion. Before making the first turn In the road I looked back toward thÂ»
great cleft in the rock. There was a green light in the sky, and In relief
stood a black figure. It was Geta, and as she saw me stop she flung up
her arms. 1 thought I heard her laugh and the one word:
" 'Coward!'
"Seating myself by the Fide of the road I pondered on the situation.
Jt seemed to mo as if a weight of blackness, which never again has lifted,
lind descended upon me. I thought of all my opportunities. I thought of
my ambitions and of Maclean and the good missionary. Dr. Mackay. I
also reasoned That between civilization and savagery it was but a ques
tion of clothing, customs and surroundings. I had seen the white man
in China do things that would have shamed a tribesman. I had seen the
white man with the Bible in one hand and the sword in the other.
"Tht> night lizard croaked incessantly and it was alwayÃ the same
thingâ 'Geta. Ceta. Geta.'
"I wore a sword something like the Tagalo 'bolas,' and I tried its edge
upon my thumb. After all, what was one coolie the less?
"A foeling of numbness came over me and I think I doze<l away.
"When 1 was again conscious it was not yet morning and the night
lizard still croaked. I was unutterably tired. Presently I heard some one
coming up the path. Instinctively T grasped my sword. It was a man.
Just as he passed the spot where I stood I let him have the sword. With
al! my strerm!i 1 struck the blow. His head rolled down the road and the
body blocked the path. 1 must have been demented, for I picked up the
body and tossed it In the bushes, muttering, 'Somebody might fall over
you and get hurt!" I remember that T was much surprised to find the
thing- still warm when 1 grasped It by the hair. It was then I discovered
the man was no Chinaman. What matter?
"It was witli a feeling of Joy that 1 stood again in the cleft of the hill.
The old man was still at bis mummeries, but before I could speak he
raised !>is head inn] Baid:
" 'I knew you would come back!'

tearh thorn their dancing steps. Let me go round and see. I believe I
can rake up enough hands somehow."
"Well, you must I" qulcK about it," said Image. "I can only give
you five minutes, captain."
Captain Kettle ran down off tho bridge and was quickly out of sight
nnd hard at h's quest for volunteers.
Presently Kettle came back.
"Well, captain," he said, "1 got a fine rrpw to volunteer, if 3*o" can
see your way to let mo have them. There's a fireman and a trimmer,
both English; there's a third-class passenger, a dago of some sort, 1
think ho Is. that was a ganger on the Congo Railway; a negro stone
mason, and there's Mr. Dayton-Phillips; that'll make a good, strong
ship's company.* 1
'â Dayton-Phillips," said Image. "Why. he's an officer In the English
army, and he's been pome sort of a resident or political tiling up in one
of those nigger towns at the back there. What's he want to go for?"
"Sal'l he'd come for the fun of the thin?. "
< .ii tain Image gave a grim laugh. "Well, I think he'll find all the
fun he's any use for before he's ashore again."
The word was "hurry. " The third mate fended off the boat while
Kettle'r. crew of nondescripts scrambled unhandily down to take their
places. The negro stone-mason, who had been a stowaway, refused stub
1. inly to leave tho steamer, and so was lowered lgnominiously in a bow
line, and then as he still ohjected loudly that he came from Sa' Leone
and v/as a free British subject, some one crammed a bucket over his head
amid the uproarious laughter of the onlookers.
Ahead of them tho quiet ship shouldered clumsily over the rollers, now
gushing down till she dipped her martingale, now swooping up again,
sending whole cataracts of water swirling along her waist.
The boat was run up cannily alongside and Kettle jumped Into the
main chains anil clambered on board over the bulwarks. "Now, pass up
my crew. Mr. Strako. " said he.
"I'm ocniinn myself next, if you don't mind," said the third mate.
"Mu=>t obey the old man's orders," he explained, as they stood together
on the sloping decks. "You heurd yourself what he said, captain."
"Weil. Mr. Mate," said Kettle, grimly, "1 hope you'll decide she's sea
worthy, because whatever view you take of it. here I'm going to stay."
The mate frowned. He was a young man; he was nere in authority,
and he had a great notion of making his authority felt. Captain Kettle
was to him merely a down-on-his-luek free-passage nobody, and as the
mate was large, and lusty he did not anticipate trouble.
The third mate led the way down to the lazaret hatch. He got his
fliiptrÂ« it! the ring and pulled it back. Then he whistled. "Half full of
water," he said. "I thought bo from the way she floated. It's ud to the
beams down here. Likely enough she'll have started a plate somewhere.
'Frald it's no go for you. captain. Why. if a breeze was to come on half
the side of her might drop out. and she'd go dowo like a stone."
Now. to Kettle's honor, be it said (seeing what he had in his mind) he
did not tackle tho man as he knelt there peering into the lazaret. Instead.
he waited till he stood up again, and then made hi 3 statement coldly and
deliberately.
"This chip's not too dangerous for me, and I choose to ludge And if
she'll do for me. nho's good enough for the crow I've got In your boat. Now
I want them on deck and at work without any more palaver/ 1
"Do you. by gad!" said the mate, ancr then the pair of them closed
without any further preliminaries. They were both of them well used
to quick rough and tumbles, nnd they both of them knew that the niari
who gets the first grip in these wrestles usually wins, and instinctively
each triod to act on that knowledge. Butif the 'third mate had bulk and
Strength, Kettle had science and abundant w'ryness; and tho;i K h the pair
of them lost their footing on the sloping cabin floor at the (ir.st embrace
and wriggled over and under like a pair of eels. Captain Kettle got a
thumb artistically fixed in the bigger man's windpipe, and held It there
doggedly. Th<' mate, growing more and more purple, hit out with savaee
force, but Kettle, dodged the bull-like blows like the boxer he was and
the mate's efforts gradually relaxed.
But at this point they wen- interrupted. "That wobbly hont was
making me seastck," said a voice, "so I came on board here ' Hullo you
fellows." . ' J
Kettle looked up. "Mr. Phillips," ho said. "I wish you'd go and get
the real of our crew, on deck out of the boat." â  .
â¢ "But what are you two doing down there?" V
"We disagreed over a question of judgment. He said this ship isn't
safe and T shouldn't have the chance toftake her home. I say there*
nothing wrong with her that can't be remedied, and home I'm coin* to
take her. anyway, It may he the one chance In my life. sir, of getting i
balance at the bank, and I'm not going to miss it " X X a
"Ho," said Dayton-Phillips. .
"If you don't like to come, you needn't," said Kettle. "But I'm coin*,
to have the stone-mason and the Dago. and those two coal-heavers PÂ»r
haps you'd better go back. . It will be wet. hard work here; no way the
sort of job to suit a soldier. â¢ â¢ "-..-"â 
Dayton-Phillips flushed slightly, and then he laughed. "I suppose that's
Intended to be nasty," he said. "Well, captain. I shall have to prove to
you that we soldiers are equal to a bit of manual labor sometimes Rv
the way .1 don't want to interfere in a personal matter, but I'd like it as
a favor if you wouldn't kill St rake quite. I rather like him "
"Anything to oblige." said Kettle, and took his thumb out of the third

Dayton-Phillips touched his cap and grinned. "Aye, aye sir "he said
and wont back up the companion. ma ' ' na sal<l>
Shortly afterward he came to report the men on hoard and Kettle
addressed his late opponent: "Now. Took here, young man I VWt want
to have more trouble on deck before the hands. ' you Had enough"'
' For the present, yes,", said the third mate, huskily "But I hnâ¢

hourly it was freshening; the barometer in the cabin was registering a
steady fall, the sky was banking up with ugly clouds.
So far tli â  well had nol been sounded. It was no use getting alarming
statistics to discourage oneself unnecessarily. But after night had fallen,
and ii was impossible t" see lo work in the gloomy hold any longer with
out lamps. Captain Kettle took the sounding rod and found eight feet.
Jl<Â» mentioned this when he took down the lamps into the hora, but he
did not think it necessary to add that as the sounding had been taken
with the well on the slant it was therefore considerably under the truth.
Still he sent Dayton-Phillips and the trimmer on deck to take a spell
at the pumps, and himself resumed his shovel work alongside tne others.
Straightway on through, the night the six men stuck to their savage
toil, th( blood irom their blistered hands- reddening the shafts of the
shovels. Every now and again one or anotherof them choked with the dust
and went to get a draft of lukewarm water from the scuttle-butt. But
no one stayed overlong on these excursions. The breeze had blown up into
a gate. The night overhead was starless and moonless, but every minute
the black heaven whs split by bursts of lightning, which showed the labor-
Ing, disheveled ship set among great mountains of breaking seas.
The Bight would have been bad from a well-manned, powerful steam
boat: from the deck of the derelict it approached the terrific.
There were four on board the ship during that terrible night -who
openly owned to -being cowed and freely bewailed their insanity in ever
beir.p" lured away from the M"poso. Dayton-Phillips had sufficient self
control to keen his feelings, whatever they were, unstated; but Kettle
faced all difficulties With indomitable courage and a smiling face.
"I believe," said Dayton-Phillips to him once when they were taking
a sp> â !! together at the clanking pumps, "you really glory in finding your
self in this beastly mess."
"We shall pull through. 1 tell you."
The shovels meanwhile had been doing their work, and although the
list was not entirely gone, the vessel at times (when a sea buttressed her
up) floated almost upright. The gale was still blowing.
The Itst was of less account now, and the vessel was once more under
command of her canvas. It was the leak which gave them most cause
for anxiety. Likely enough it was caused by the mere wrenching away
of a couple of rivets. But the steady inpour of water tnrmigh the holes
would soon have made the ship grow unmanageable and founder if It was
not constantly attended to.
The dreaded bay, fickle as usual, saw fit to receive them at first with a
smiling face. During the afternoon they rose the brown sails of a Portu
guese iiÂ«hing schooner, and Kettle headed toward her.
Let his crew be as willing as they would, there was no doubt that this
murderous work at the pumps could not be kept up for a voyage to
England. If he could nut zv.x further reinforcements he would have to
take the ship Into the nearest foreign port to barely save hor from sink
ing. Ami then where would be hid sighed-for salvage? Woefully thinned,
he thought, or more probably whisked away altogether. Captain Kettle
had ii vast distrust for the shore foreigner over questions of law pro
ceedings and money matters. So he made for the schooner, hove his own
vessel to, and signaled that he wished to speak.
A boa; was slipped Into the water from the schooner's deck and ten
swarthy; ragged Portuguese fishermen crammed, into her. Two or three
of them had a working; knowledge of English; their captain spoke it with
fluent Inaccuracy, and before any of them hnd gone aft to Kettle, who
stood at the wheel, they had heard the whole story of the ship being
found derelict, ;;twl (very naturally) were anxious enough by some means
or another to finger a share of the salvage.
Their leader made his proposal at once. "All right-a, captain. T see
how you want. We take charge now and take-a you into Ferrol without
you being at nvre trouble."
"Nothing of the kind." said Kettle, "I'm just wanting the loan of two
or three bands to give my fellows a spell or two at that pump. We're a
bit short-handed, that's all. I'll pay A. B.s wages on Liverpool scale,
and that's a loi more than you Dagos give among yourselves, and if the
men work well I'll throw in a dash besides for 'baeea money.' "
"Ta-ta-ta." said the Portuguese, with a wave of his yellow fist. "It
cannot be done, and I will not lend you men. It shall be' as I say: We
take-a you into Ferrol. Do not fear-a, cap! tan; you .shall have money for
finding sheep; you shall have some of our salvage."
Dayton-Phillips, who was standing near, and knew the little sailor's
views, looked for an outbreak. But Kettle held himself In. and still spoke
to the man civilly.
â¢'That's good Knglish you talk," he said. "Do all your crowd under
stand the language?"
"No," said the fellow, readily enough, "that man does not, nor does
he, nor him."
"Right-O." said Kettle. 'Then a.s those three men can't kick up a
bobbery at the other end, they've just got to stay here and heln work
this vessel home. As for the rest of you filthy, stinking, scale-covered
cousins of apes, over the side of the vessel you go before you're put.
Thought you were going to steal my lawful salvage, did you, you crawling
yellow-faced ah!"
The hot-tempered Portuguese wafc not a man to stand this tirade (as
Kettle anticipated) unmoved. His fingers made a vengeful snatch toward
the knife in his belt, but Kettle was ready for this, and caught it first and
flung ii overboard. Then, with a clever heave, he picked up the man and
sent him after (ho knife. He tripped up one of the Portuguese who
couldn't speak English, dragged him to the cabin companion and toppled
him down the ladder. Dayton-Phillips (surprised at himself for abetting
such lawlessness) captured a second in like fashion, and the English fire
man and coal-trimmer picked up the third and dropped him down an open
hatchway into the grain in the hold beneath.
But there were six of the fishermen left upon the deck, and these did
not look upon the proceedings unmoved. They had been slow to act at
first, but when the initial surprise was over they were blazing with
rage and eager to do murder. The Italian and the Sierra Leone negro
ran out of theiir way on to the forecastle head, and they came on. vain
glorious In numbers and armed with their deadly knives. But the two
English roughs, the English gentleman and the little English sailor, were
all of them men well accustomed to take care of their own skins' the
belaying pins out of the plnrail seemed to come by instinct into their
hands, and not one of them got so much as a scratch.
It was all the affair of a minute. It does not do to let these little
Impromptu scrimmages simmer over long. In fact, the whole affair was
decided in the first rush. The quartet of English went In, despising the
Dagos, and quite Intending to clear them off the ship. The invaders were
driven overboard by sheer weight of blows and prestige, and the victors
leaned on the bulwark, puffing and gasping, and watched them swim
away to their boat through the clear water below.
"Set of blooming pirates," said Kettle.
But Dayton-Phillips spemed to view the situation from a different
point. "I'm rather thinKTngf we are the pirates. How about those three
we've got on board.?"
"They no speakee English." said Kettle, dryly. "You might have
heard me ask that, sir, before I started to talk to that skipper to make
him begin the show. And he did begin it, and that's the great point. If
ever you've been in a police court you'll always find the magistrate ask.
Who began this trouble?' And when he finds out. that's the man hÂ«
logs. No, those fishermen won't kick up a bobbery when they get back
to happy Portugal apain, and as for our own crowd here on board, they
aren't likely to talk when they get ashore and have money due to them.
"Well, I suppose there's reason in that, though I should have nr?
doubts about ;he stone-mason. He comes from Sierra Leone, remembeCJ
and they're groat on the rights of man there." 1
"Quite bo," said Kettle. "I'll see the stone-mason gets packed oft to
sea again in a stokehold before he has a chance of stirring up the mu<t
ashore. When the black man gets too pampered he has to be brought low,
again with a rush."
"I see." said Dayton-Phillips, and then he laughed.
"There's something that tickles you, sir?"
"I was thinking, skipper, for a man that believes he's being put In the
way of a soft thing by direct guidance from on high, you're using up a
tremendous lot of energy to make sure the Almighty's wishes don. t mis
carry."
"Mr. Phillips," said Kettle, gravely, "it was understood when he let
me know I was to have this chance I was to do my human utmost to
carry it throurh myself. God sends us all Into this world with hands
and heads, and he isn't pleased with a man who doesn't put these to their
proper uses."
The three captive Portuguese were brought up on deck and werÂ«
quickly induced by the ordinary persuasive methods of the merchant
service officer to forego their sulklness and turn to diligently at what
work was required of them. But even with this help the heavy ship was
still considerably undermanned, and the Incessant labor at the pumps fell
wearily on all hands. The bay. true to its fickle, nature, changed on them
again. The sunshine was swamped by a driving gray mist of rain and
the glass started on a steady fall.
The night worsened as it went on. The wind piled up steadily In
violence, and the sea rose till the sodden vessel rode it with a very babel
of shrieks an.l groans and complaining sounds. Toward morning a ter
rific squall powdered up against them and hove her down, and a dull
rumbling was heard in her bowels, to let them know that once more her
cargo had shifted.
For the moment even Kettle thought that this time she was gone for
good. She lost her way and lay down like a log in the water, and tha
racing seas roared over her as though she had been a half-tide rock.
Then to the impact of a heavier gasp of the squall the topgallant
masts went, and the small loss of top weight seemed momentarily to easo
her. Kettle seized upon the moment. He left the trimmer and one of the
Portuguese at the wheel and handed himself along the streaming decks
and kicked and cuffed the rest of his crew into activity. He gave his
orders, and the .ship wore slowly round before the wind and began to pay
away on the other tack.
Great hills of sea deluged her In the process. and her people worked
like mormon, half of thoir time submerged. But by degrees, as the vast
rollers hit and shook her with their ponderous impact, she came upright
again, and after a little while shook the grain level in her holds and
assumed her normal /Â»ng!e of heel.
Dayton-Phillips struggled up and hit Kettle on the shoulder. "How's
that, umpire?" he bawled. "My faith, you are a clever sailor."
Captain Kettle touched Ins cup. "God bore a hand there, sir" hÂ«
shouted through the wind, "[f I'd tried to straighten her tip like that
without his h<>lp "very man here would have been fish-chop this minutfc"
Even Dayton-Phillips, skeptical though he might be, began to thi^Sc
there was "something in it" aa the voyage went on. To begin with, tha
leak stopped. They did not know how it had happened, and they did not
very much care. Kettle had his theories. Anyway, it stopped. To go on
with, although they were buffeted with every kind of evil weather, all
their mischances were speedily rectified. In a heavy sea their unstable
cargo surged about as though it had been liquid, but it always shifted
back apain before she quite capsized.
All hands got covered with salt-water boils. All hands, with the ex
ception of Kettle, who remained, as usual, neat, grew gaunt, bearded,
dirty and unkempt. They were grimed with sea salt, they were flayed by
violent suns: but by flint of hard schooling they were becoming handy
sailormen, all of them, and even the negro stone-mason learned to obey
an order without first thinking over its justice till he earned a premoni
tory hiding.
"It's a blooming Flying Dutchman we're on." said the coal-trimmer
who acted as mate. "There's no killing the old beast. Only hope shÂ«
gets us ashore somehow and doesn't stay fooling about at sea forever
just to get into risks. T want to get off her. She's too blooming lucky to
be quite wholesome, somehow."
In Bristol Channel a little spattering tug wheeled up within hail toss
ing like a cork on the brown waves of the estuary, and her skipper In tha
green pulpit between the paddle boxes waved a hand cheerily.
"Seem to have found some, dirty weather, captain?" he bawled "Want
a pull into Cardiff or Newport?"
"Cardiff. What price?"
"Say Â£100."
"I wasn't asking to buy the tug. You're putting a pretty fancy figure
on her for that new lick of paint you got on your rail "
"I'll take Â£80."
"Oh. I can sail her in myself if you're going to be funny. She's as
handy as a pilot-boat, brig-ripped like this, and my crew know her fine
I'll give you Â£20 into < ardiff. and you're to dock me for that "
"Come, now, captain, thirty. I'm not here for sport, Ivc got to maka

Continued from Page Seventeen.
self secreted. Pven In this land of freedom he fears to walk abroad
as other men do, for he has heard that his merciless pursuers have
tracked him even to San Francisco, and he dreads not only bodily
â  but is apprehensive that they may use strategy and force

Is at night when he goes out for a walk. When a few months
ago Ivanhoe landed in this city from a sailing vessel from Yoko
hama, without money and no means of securing employment, Alex
v-idovitch, a fellow countryman, gave him food and shelter.
ree had made his way to this country by working for his
an ordinary seaman.
Nicholas Ivanhce was born in the town of Btavropol, which Is in
the province of the same name in the southern part of Russia. He
was one of a large family. His father was a lawyer and well-to-do,
and hla family was among the best. Here It was Nicholas lived and
received his primary education until he was seventeen years of age,
when suddenly the blow that was to wreck hia home and change
his entire life fell in the twinkling of an eye. His father had un
dertaken the defense of a man whom the government officials sup
posed to be a nihilist, but against whom they had no direct proof.
The man was being tried for murder, and Ivanhoe's father defended
him with great energy. In endeavoring to acquit his client he dis
played more than professional warmth and Interest, and unfortu
nately spent his own money freely In his attempt to save the man,
who was, however, convicted to pay the extreme penalty of the law.
There was In Stavropol those who hated Attorney Ivanhoe be
cause of his success and who whispered that he seemed unduly In
terested In the case of his client. The convicted man became In
censed at the lawyer because he had not cleared him, and when on
the scaffold took a dying revenge of Ingratitude and deception by
declaring that his lawyer had done all in his power to clear him
because he was like himself â a nihilist.
This was all that was needed and it was not many days before
the lawyer was arrested by the secret service officials and thrown
Into prison. A hasty trial followed, and upon only the word of a
lying murderer the unfortunate man was convicted of being a plotter
against the government and was sentenced to be banished as an
exile for life to the far-away Island of Saghalien, where 200,000
miserable beings drag out an existence.
This It was that caused Nicholas Ivanhoe to hate his country
and to plot In his heart to do anything that could injure the govern
ment. Ills mother died of a broken heart shortly after her husband
was banished. His brothers and sisters were scattered to the four
corners of the earth, for their home was confiscated. Then it was
that Nicholas went to St. Petersburg to try and make his living.
Thero he found men, who, like himself, had grievances against the
Government. ThÂ«y were nihilists and he Joined them. To him the
creed that he ha^l adopted represented only a possible means of ob
taining a Just revenge. He lived in St. Petersburg for three years
and during that time he became connected with the press. He
worked hard and saved his small pay. With the money that he ac
cumulated he studied the art of photography and bought himself a
camera and outfit.
It was in December, 1889. that he landed upon the Island of
Saghalien. As If by a strange coincidence the first person that he
met there was a man named kiroff, who, like himself, was a nihilist.
At this time Kiroff was working upon the island as a common laborer
for one of the rich lcnd-owners. He was familiar with the country
and when Ivanhoe imparted to him the object of bio coming to
Saghalien he told him that it would be impossible for him to obtain
a position such as he desired.
At first the poor fellow was greatly discouraged. It seemed hard
for him to fail in his undertaking: after he had come so far. Kiroff
listened to his story and sympathized with him. He then advised
Nicholas to go to Nlcolaievsk, which is at the mouth of the Omogoon
Riveft in Siberia, just across the Oulf of Tartary, which is several
hundSed miles wide and which separates Raghalien from the main
land. Thither he went in accordance with his friend'B advice, little
thinking at the time that in after years his visit to the place would
be the means of saving his life.
At Nicolaievsk he obtained employment an a sailor on one of
th* vf-rsels that ply between that port and Sag-halien. Here fortune
favored him, for the very vessel upon which he sailed was one of
vernraent transports used to carry the exiles over to SaÃhalien.
Thus he became acquainted with some of the jailers and assistant
Jailers, who guarded the prisoners. He also learned how to handle
a vessel, and he never lost an opportunity to become familiar with
the Gulf of Tartary and the port of Nicolalevak,

After he had worked as a sailor for two years he obtained the
position of assistant Jailer at Alexandrovskii, which Is the name of
the town upon the island where the prison is located. This came
about in a strange way. The vessel on which he was serving was
transporting 1 a lot of prisoners over on one occasion when a terrible
storm suddenly rose. One of the guards was washed overboard and
lost. Finally when the vessel reached the island the chief Jailer
asked the captain if he might get oue of the sailors to act as a
guard. Nicholas declared that he was willing to go and his services
were accepted. At last it seemed that he was about to accomplish
his heart's desire. He left the vessel with a light heart. So well
did he perform his duty and with such apparent indifference did he
strike a prisoner over the head whenever one lagged on the march
that he made a favorable impression on the chief Jailer.
The outcome was that since the place of the lost assistant Jailer
had to be filled it was offered to Ivanhoe, who, after some as-
Burned hesitancy, accepted It. At last he had achieved his main
purpose. He was upon the Island, and what was more he was in
a position where he could best search for his father and where he
could also obtain Just such information as he most desired. It Is
needless to say that from the time that he left St. Petersburg
Nicholas had traveled and worked under an assumed name. He
began the performance of his duties with alacrity and fidelity. Well
he knew the part he had to play and he realized that It had
to be acted with a naturalness that would completely disarm every
suspicion.
He was placed in charge of one of the wards in the prison. His
duties were to lock up the prisoners when they returned from the
mines at night and to take them out In the morning. He also had
to feed them every morning and night, and he was required to
make two rounds every night to each cell in order to see that all
of the prisoners in his ward were secure.
One of the first things that he discovered was that his father
had been killed a few months prior to his obtaining his position.
He was one of those that worked In the coal mines and one day
he had been crushed to- death by the falling of a car that was used
to raise the coal from the pits. At first Nicholas was almost heart
broken and he was upon the verge of giving up his position and re
turning to Russia, but the thought of all that he and his family
had suffered, of his father's unjust punishment and of his untimely
death served to harden his heart and to make him strong in his
resolve to prosecute to the bitter end his revenge. Ivanhoe made up
his mind to stay at Alexandrovskii and to secure everything that
would be of help to his one object In life â the exposing of the tor
tures and cruelties that were being inflicted on- the unfortunate peo
ple that were confined at the prison.
After two years' sojourn upon the Island he was promoted to be
a full jailer and In his new position he had access to the torture
chamber. He made a careful study of everything about him, and
every night it was his custom to compile a lot of notes of what had
happened during the day. Daily he recorded the death of one or
more of the unfortunate wretches, who had found liberty and free
dom In death. Many of these died from disease contracted for lack
of medical attention, many completely worn out and only half fed
died beneath the horrible torture that was inflicted upon them. More
than once Ivanhoe saw some poor creature utter his last groans
upon the flogging board. These barbarous tortures he was forced to
witness, and when some prisoner would faint from sheer pain while
being lashed he would have to apply restoratives In order to bring
him to consciousness that he might receive the full sentence of his
punishment.
He assisted at more than one hanging, where some wretch was
compelled to pay the death penalty because he had attempted to
escape, or had fought with one of his fellow prisoners or done some
thing else that displeased Kononovltch, who was then the Governor
of the island. All of these scenes made an Indelible impression upon
the mind of Ivanhoe, and as he witnessed each new torture he grew
stronger in his resolve. When he was able to do so he gave succor
and medicine to the convicts. Sometimes he would Increase their
allowance of food. This, however, he was not able to do often, for
well he knew the risk that he ran and what would have been the
results if he had been caught in his acts of mercy. The hangings
he described as brutal beyond the power of human tongue to depict
in words. The man or woman, who was ordered to be executed sim
ply upon the word of Governor Kononovitch, was led Into a cell or
small square chamber, where they were permitted to view their
scaffold. This was simply a cross-piece of wood resting on two up
right supports. Over the convict there was placed a long black
gown, shaped like a bag, then the rope was thrown over the beam
and the attendants hauled the struggling wretch from the ground
and hf-ld him suspended in the air until they thought him dead. Not
infrequently it happened that the poor prisoner would be lowered
before the life had been strangled out of him, in which case the
hanging would have to be gone over again.
Nicholas availed himself of his position to take photographs of
these scenes. This he was able to do because he was generally the
mistaken. The town had been going: to
the devil up to April 4. But praise the
Lord, since that date she thought it had
been going the other way.
April 4, by the way, is a date it Is well
to remember in this story. There was an
election on that day.
Several of the most prominent men In
Beattie, who were politically buried be
tween the hours of 7 in the morning and 5
in the evening of April 4, told me that
they were convinced that Mayor Totten
was a very capable woman of affairs.
They believed that she would run her
town for the next year with a carpenter's
hammer, a broom and a Marlin rifle.
"A rifle?" I asked.
"Oh, yes: the Council has its armament
and maguzlne."
The former Council bought them for
protection against Lem Gouldsberry, the
Vermillion Creek "bad man"â but this is
another part of the story.
Well, anyhow, Mayor Totten got wind
of the weapons and said she might need
them before she got through.
These are only a very small part of the
funny things I saw and heard in Beattie.
If Charles H. Hoyt and Chsfrles Klein
want some new and strictly American
comedy or comic opera material, or David
Belasco is after an up-to-date Western
drama, full of thrilling situations, Kansas
atmosphere and Just a proper tinge of
blood. Beattie is the place to go.
Even in Kansas, where they are used to
heing original, Beattie is regarded as the
prize town.
No other Kansas community Is worthy
nf being mentioned now in the Efltme
firmament with SockJesa Jerry and Sister
Mary Ellen Lease.
Tlio strangest thing I heard while in
Beattie was that Mrs. Lease had never
lectured there.
The od<i< st thing I saw was the man.
Town Marshal, sitting in Mayor Eliza
beth Totten's office, turning hi? hat in his
fingers, between his legs, like afi awk
ward schoolboy, as he listened to the
woman Mayor's energetic order that he
should uphold every letter of the law if
it took every Marlin and every woman In
the Council to back him.
The Marshal did not seem overpleased
with his Job.
Quite the most attractive thing in Beat
tie is City Clerk Kate O'Neill, a typical
Irish beauty, who polled the biggest vote
official in charge in the torture chamber. He declares that of the
200,000 exiles supposed to be upon the island of Saghalien over one
third have disappeared, and that the greater proportion of these
have been done to death by the Inhuman cruelties to which they have
been subjected.
There was one occasion when Ivanhoe came very near losing
control of himself, which would have been fatal to him. A woman
was one day brought to the prison and by the order of the Governor
she was to be loaded with specially heavy chains and was to be fed
on bread and water while forced to do hard manual labor. This
woman was the wife of a celebrated Russian statesman, who had
been exiled and she had shared a similar punishment because of
her loyalty to her husband. When he was in St. Petersburg Nicholas
had once attended a grand ball that had been given at her palace.
She was a woman who had been reared in wealth and luxury and
noted for her charity and goodness of heart. On the journey to the
island she had been subjected to revolting indignities, and when
she reached the prison at Alexandrovskii she was so completely
exhausted from the march and the want of sufficient food that she
could not stand. They took her Into the blacksmith's shop to have
her chains forged upon her, and one of the attendants struck her
In the face with his fist because she was unable to stand upon her
feet when he released his hold upon her. As the woman sank to
the ground with a cry of pain the man again kicked her. For. the
moment Nicholas forgot everything and sprung at the fellow. For
tunately he remembered himself and did not strike his assistant.
It was about this time that Ivanhoe began to send back to
Russia to the Journals for which he was working descriptions of
what he had witnessed and pictures of some of the scenes that he
had taken. These were published, along with the pictures, but the
identity of the author was kept a secret. Then It was that the
Government officials began to put In operation that perfect and
merciless machinery of surveillance with the hopes of finding who
it was that was disclosing the secrets of state. Very naturally
their search took them to the prison at Alexandrovskii, for they
knew that the traitor, whoever he might be, was withdn the walls
of the prison. Despite their hardest efforts they were unable to
detect the man whom they wanted.
Finally one of the assistant Jailers, who had been dismissed for
some reason, and whom Nicholas afterward learned was the very
man that he had attacked in the blacksmith's shop, called the at
tention of the Governor to the incident that had happened. He had
been afraid to do so as long as he was employed at the prison be
cause he feared Ivanho*. Kononovltch determined to have Ivanhoe's
mail watched and to intercept his correspondence. This he did and
one of the letters that fell Into his possession contained some instruc
tions from one of the nihilist societies to which Ivanhoe belonged. This
was all that was needed. The Governor determined upon the arrest
of the Jailer.
Here again It was that providence or his star of fortune stood
Nicholas in good stead. The Governor had employed in his household
a domestic. She was an old woman who had served out her term.
She had yet been a convict when Ivanhoe came to the prison, and on
one occasion he had done her a kindness. The woman had never for
gotten this, and she risked her life to show her gratitude to her bene
factor. When Kononovltch was discussing the arrest with the officials
of the secret service, and was showing to them the letter that he
had Intercepted, the woman overheard their conversation, and she
determined to Inform Ivanhoe. According to the plans of the Gov
ernor, Nicholas Ivanhoe was to be arrested the next morning.
When the conference at Kononovltch's mansion broke up this
woman went secretly to Ivanhoe and told him what she had over
heard. He thanked her for her kindness, and determined to make
his escape while he yet had a chance. He fully realized what would
be his fate if he permitted himself to be arrested. There was no
time to lose. It was necessary to act and act quickly If he hoped to
get away from the island.
This was In December, 1896. The mountains were covered with
Bnow, and the only transportation was by the means of dog sleds.
Nicholas determined to try to get to Langra, which is In the extreme
northern part of the island, on the coast of the Gulf of Tartary and
opposite to Nlcholalevsk. If he could reach this point before the
police, there was a chance for him to cross the gulf, reach Siberia and
work his way down into Korea, and thence take a steamer to Toka
hama, from which point he hoped to sail for America. Prom the first
he realized that permanent safety could only be hoped for in the land
above which floats the stars and stripes.
The one thing in his favor was that there was no telegraphic
communication between Alexandrovskii and Langra. If he could only
get sufficient start of those who wished to work him harm he hoped
to escape. He quickly changed his jailer's uniform for other clothes,
and taking with him his photographs and notes he silently slipped
out of the prison. He left Alexandrovskii about 10 o'clock at night.
In the village he secured a team of dogs and a sled, and with a
driver set out on his lonely Journey. He arrived at Langra the next
on the woman's ticket, as If fate rebuked
the members of her family, all of whom
cast their ballots against her. Miss O'Neill

"Well, the majority of these women in
the Council were schoolteachers. It
was humiliating enough to be beaten by
women, but to be dictated to by school
teachers is rubbing it in. You know what
a schoolteacher don't know Isn't worth
mentioning."
Back comes Mayor Totten:
"Schoolteachers know something of
human nature. A man generally does not
know what Is good for him."
One of the things upon which the
woman government relies for success is
the fact that three-fourths of the Council
own their own property and have ably
managed their own affairs.
"A woman can beat a man in matters
of domestic economy, and we will prove
she is his- superior in political economy,"
Mayor Totten emphasizes.
She is full of these aphorisms.

We went Into the hotel, down a back
stairway and rapped at a little door. It
was unbarred by John Burnside, the man
who has run the only saloon In the town
for several years.
But somehow the vigilant Mayor did
hear of the evasion, and quietly sent word !
to Burnside, ordering him to get rid of
every drop of his liquor by last Saturday
night, without further notice.
"Will you do It?" I asked.
"Will I do it? I guess yes. I'm going
to give up the hotel, too. This Is too hard

Beattie is a pretty little town of 1000 in- j

As soon as he arrived at Langra he hastened to the water front
where he was familiar with the locality. When he used to sail in
there as a sailor he had studied the harbor and made many friends
He remembered an eld man who kept boats for hire, and to him he
hastened. He soon struck a bargain with his friend for the use of
a small sail boat, telling him that he wanted it early the next morn
ing, and requesting to be shown where it was moored, as he said that
he might go out on the gulf at a very early hour and did not wish to
disturb any one to get the boat for him. He quieted any suspicions
that the old man had by telling him that one of the prison transports
was due early the next day, and that he wished to intercept it for the
purpose of securing some information from one of the prisoners that it
would be impossible to obtain from him after he landed. His old
friend showed Nicholas where the boat was moored and then bid him
good night. A few hours later Ivanhoe stole to the deserted seawall
He realized that if he was to escape there was no time to be lost'
He knew that it was a dangerous undertaking to attempt to cross
the bay in a small sail boat, but It was his only chance. However
he was a good sailor, and he was familiar with the bay. Fortunately
It was a clear night, nd he was able to steer by the north star. It
v.-as bitterly cold, and he was In danger of freezing to death Under
such circumstances any heart less stout than Ivanhoe's would have
faltered, but he had been training himself too long to think of giving
up now, and, besides, his resolve and the thought of revenge had by
this time become so much a part of his nature that he would not
have hesitated at death itself. The wind was In his favor, and thÂ»
next night he sailed Into the port which he had left several years
before.
So far all was well. He had accomplished his purpose, and the
next thing necessary was to get to a harbor of refuge. He knew that
his pursuers would soon follow and that as soon as they once landed
in Siberia no stone would be left unturned to locate his whereabout*
if he was above earth. To attempt to reach Europe by crossing over
the continent was to Invite arrest; to keep along the coast and work
his way south was equally dangerous. These were the thoughts that
presented themselves for solution. Finally he hit upon a plan that
seemed to him the safest, and which would afford him the best chance
of escape.
He succeeded by constant travel in reaching Khabarovka in ten
days, and from there he set out In a due east direction for the moun
tains. This journey he made on foot, for he was unwilling to take
the risk of traveling by the public roads, and in the day time at that.
It was a weary march of more than a month. He only traveled by
night, and during the day he would hide himself in some thicket or
in the forests, and get such rest as was possible. For food he was
more than once sorely pressed. The people at the farm houses at
which he applied for bread and meat looked at him suspiciously.
In Siberia, Ivanhoe declares, every one is suspicious. Finally he
landed one day at a small mining town In the very heart of the
mountains. It was simply a rude settlement of huts. Here he man
aged to obtain employment. For a time at least he was safe. It
would be hard to locate him, he knew, working as he was in the
mines, and only coming out at nights to sleep.
Nicholas Ivanhoe lived In these mountains for over a year. One
night after he had been at the mines for a few months he heard the
men talking of an escaped jailer from Saghalien. They said that the
Governor had put a great prize on his head, and that the border
countries were keeping a close lookout for him. They said that he
had in his possession certain state secrets that the Russian Govern
ment was very anxious to obtain possession of, and that the reward
for his capture would be paid whether he was taken alive or dead
This fact It was that made Nicholas decide that It was best for him to
continue at the mines for some time.
After he had been hidden in his mountain security for eighteen
months, Nicholas made up his mind to make a bold break for liberty
It took him over three months to work his way into Korea. Ivanhoe
declares with a smile that the first breath that he drew with any
pleasure was when he crossed the Amnok River and entered the town
of Suh, leaving behind him forever thp dominion of the Czar.
Next he proceeded to La Tsiu, which is in the southern part of
Korea; then he went to the island of Quelpaert, whence he took a
vessel to Yokohama. It was from this port that he managed to work
his passage to San Francisco.
As for his future plans he can say nothing definite, except that
he is as strong as ever In his one purpose to give to the world the
benefit of what he knows regarding the cruelties of the Russian
prisons. The pictures that are here published are reproduced from
some of the photographs taken by Ivanhoe at the prison. He has
many hundreds of these showing scenes too revolting to be gazed upon
by the human eye. At present he is negotiating with a large Eastern
magazine with a view of writing for them a hiÃtory of hla experience*
upon the island of Saghalien.

THE question of side-saddles re
solves itself into two parts, the
physiological and the artistic.
There can be no doubt that the
side-saddle does not entirely meet

there is no doubt that it is infinitely su
perior from the artistic standpoint.
Which deserves the most considera

I DO not think that any of the girls

Daring and expert horsewomen have
found the aide-saddle secure enough for
their most venturesome feats, so it is
certainly safe enough for the average
rider. Even If it tends to develop one
side more than the other, there is
scarcely any one who rides sufficiently

MY EXPERIENCE AS A DENTIST IN THE SULTAN`S HAREM
\^^ Tory
OW would you like to get into the harem of the Sultan of
w 4 Turkey and Bee from day to day and at your leisure how
I I his 2000 favorites live in all their Oriental splendor. :
l^f That is exactly what a young woman who is sojourning
vÂ£ I in San Francisco has done. She is a remarkably bright
| Â£ young woman and has come on here from Turkey to take
v a special course in dentistry, so that she may artistically
& tinker the teeth of the harem houris. The young woman
i- a dentist by profession and the Grand Turk has turned
over to her care the preservation of all the pretty teeth in .the harem.
Although the pay is princely the task is do easy one, according to
the story of this young 1 lady, â /â¢â¢'(
Dr. E. Mantafounes is not a name that would seem to attract
the confidence of the person in charge of the Sultan's harem. It
sounds very much like bearded intelligence and gold-bowed spectacles.
On the contrary, though, the bearer of that name is a bright, viva
cious young lady with many of the modern accomplishments of civili
zation. She is a graduate of the university at Paris and has been
for some time past a student at the dental department of our State
University. Her story is most interesting to all readers who are
fond of the mysteries of the Orient, even though it may upset some
>>f ur preconceived ideas on the subject.
Mis Mantafounes was born of Greek parents in the Island of
Scio, belonging to Asia .Minor, but was educated at the American
College at Athens. Her studies there consisted principally of lan
guages] and she has accomplished a list that would stagger most of
v:s who have ever given our serious attention to even a few of those
enumerated here: French, English, â¢ Greek (ancient, and modern),
Italian! Turkish (which she was obliged to study at home under a
private tutor), Arabic and German. All of these she speaks fluently,
and it is simply a revelation to the listener as he hears her skip
easily from one tongue to another, apparently without an effort.
In music the lady is an accomplished performer on the piano,
violin^ mandolin and guitar. She - says she is scarcely up to the
"liike" craze yet as it is not very popular with the ladies of Greece,
After graduating from the college at Athens she went" to Paris
t<> study dentistry, and while there was made chief assistant to the
famous professor, Dr. M.'jtr.mii. for three years. Her father
tra's at that tin a professor in a Turkish college at the island of
Parries, belonging to the Turkish Government, a. most peculiar place,
by the way, where it is not p<^sible to reside without a permit from
the Sultrin or one of his chiefs, countersigned by his Majesty.
The Sultan has a palace there and it is one of his favorite resorts.
She had been at this place but a short time when she was invited
to treat some of the ladies- of the harem who were troubled with a
disease of the teeth which is very common with the women of that
part of the world.
It seems that the teeth are inclined to turn black and crumble
much earlier than nature intended such decay should occur. The
little doctor says she was much troubled by these strange symptoms,
which were quite foreign to anything she had ever seen in Paris, and
she concluded to study the matter out, thinking it might possibly
be of some â â¢â¢â lit to the scientific world.
â "I am positive," she said, "that I at last reached at least a rea
sonable solution of the problem. You see the woman of the harem
are very fond of beautifying themselves, and they do not hesitate
at any artificial means that they think may possibly add to their
natural charms. And really they are very beautiful, as a rule. But
like . .any silly women who do not belong to the Sultan's household
they fondly imagine that cosmetics improve the complexion, and
they do plaster them on in a most alarming manner. This would not
bo such a serious matter if they only had the proper materials, but
they are Orientals and of course are a few centuries behind us in
all things â toilet articles included.
"] found they were using a paste which they call in their own
language 'fykos' â the most villainous preparation ever invented. It
contains mush mercury and arsenic, and Boon reaches the vital points
by absorption. Now any dentist will tell you the deleterious effect
of mercury on the teeth. Bui not satisfied with this voluntary
destruction of one of their chief charms, they insist on eating every
form of confectionery that comes within their reach, as if to exag
gerate the trouble as much as possible.
"Having found the cause, I tried my best to remedy the effect.
I advised a more wholesome diet and the use of less harmful cos
metics all in vain; those people are bound to follow the precepts of
their ancestors, and you can neither coax nor drive them, so 1 mode
up my mind to do all possible in an artificial way to replace the
wanton destruction these simple creatures had caused through their
own Ignorance. .
"They despise a plate, so I was obliged to resort to what we call
in the trade crown and bridge work. I thought I -was doing fairly
T.oll In this line till I met a lady from England during my vacation,
which I spent at Athens, who showed me sumo modern improvements
which were quit, new to me, and I imitated as well as I could, gen
erally with indifferent success. However, I did the best 1 could
under the circumstances and made up my mind to visit .London as
soon as possible and learn all these, new tricks, which were abso
lutely necessary for the 'lass of work I was so anxious to pursue. â 
"I had about decided to ask for a leave of absence that I might
make this pilgrimage to London, . when my father was asked to go
to Constantinople and take charge of one of the Government schools
which the Sultan was fostering. I was asked to accompany my
father and to remain there as dentist to the royal household.
"Of course this request amounted virtually to a command, and
nothing was left but to obey. So we went to beautiful Constanti
nople. Now- you needn't smile, for Constantinople is beautiful. Of
course you will say it is dirty, but you know nothing of the interior
of the beautiful palaces of that city. You tourists see only the ex
teriors of the nice places, but you know nothing of the beauties
within.
"After all I don't suppose you want to know my opinion of Con
stantinople. All you want is my experience in the harem: that is
the mystery you are after. Well, if you will allow me, I will tell it
in my own way.
"When we arrived at Constantinople we went to a hotel, where
I was given time to change my traveling dress for something more
in keeping with the Oriental idea of the fitness of things. This was
not as easy as you may suppose, for I am a Greek and we have
the most . .-id- d aversion for anything Turkish, still I realized that
it was necessary to make something at least resembling the native
toilet.
"My residence at Bamos had so far educated me in this respect
that I knew about what was expected. I was soon ready and found
that the servants from th" palace were already waiting with a car
riage to drive me to the most exclusive house in all this wide world.
I was a bit nervous at first, but was assured by one attendant that
] had nothing to fear. 'For.' said he, 'you arc under the protection
of the great Turkish Government.. Nothing .can harm, you.'
"'Oh,' I said. 'I know the Government means me no harm, but
I do feel a little anxious aboW individuals. 1
" 'Madame need have no' fear; we of the Sultan's household are
not savages. Take this if you. doubt my word,' and he handed me,
this beautiful silver-hilted dagger. Is' it not pretty? But I. had to
promise faithfully not to allow the little instrument out of my pos
session, as it is contrary to the rules of the harem for a woman to
carry any kind of weapon. I gave my promise and felt much more
comfortable for its companionship.
"We then entered the carriage and drove to the Sultan's palac%
I can never forget my feelings upon entering that famous gateway.
What might happen? I had heard all kinds of stories; I knew of the
bowstring and oblivion in the Bosphorus. But I concluded to take
my medicine as it came and murmur not at all.
"We drove to a private gate 1 and were admitted by an ebony
faced slave, about the finest specimen of the Nubian I have ever.
seen. For a moment I thought the man had just left an oil bath
he was so shiny. I soon learned that he was the chief eunuch of
the harem and a person of great importance, and stranger still a
man of great wealth, though still a slave in every sense of the word.
"I was next ushered into the main reception room; that is the
one set aside for the women of the harem. I can't begin to tell you
how many of them were present, but a great number, and ..as I
entered each within reach gently raised the hem of my garment
and kissed it In the most delicate and respectful manner.

world, and care less. They always remind one of a lot of domestic
birds who have never knnwn what it is to use their wings; they
are happyâhappy as tlwday is lons, for their cage is a very large one
and also very beautiful, and ihey enjoy one great privilege: they
are allowed all the sweetmeats they care to eat, and as they are
very much like children this little privilege makes them supremely
happy. They also absorb great quantities of grease, of which they
are passionately fond.
"Now, they are not supposed to drink wine, although I found
they did so secretly. You know it is forbidden by the Koran. But
they smoke incessantly; cigarettes only, but you scarcely find one
without a cigarette between her pretty lips.
"I was quite mystified for a time at the entire absence of any
thing in the way of that soft down so common to the faces of dark
women, but soon learned the secret of its absence, for the lady
barber made her appearance a short time after my arrival. Her
professional operations are most ingenious, and I was deeply inter
ested as well as amused by them.
"No, she does not use a razor. Her who+e kit consists of a bit
of twine, with which she succeeds in removing every particle of
hair that may grow on {he face. To explain this operation. Of course
you have seen iittle children at pla> with what they call cat's cradle?
Well, just take the first figure of that little game and you have the
instrument in working order. Now hold the twine against the face
of the patient just where the two lines cross each other, then pro
ceed with the see-saw movement and you will find that every hair
is pulled out. rout and branch. This is very painful indeed, and I
never had the nerve to try it a second time. But as I told you in
the beginning a Turkish woman will bear anything in order to beau
tify herself. They submit to this painful operation about twice a
month. Heroic, isn't it?
"They love music, do these women of the harem. Of course it
Id not the kind of music we care for, still one soon becomes fond
of it, and I must admit that 1 have heanl some <>f the music of great
composers very well rendered by inmates of the harem, but as a
rule they prefer their native Iqve Bongs, and onde you have caught
the idea you rather admin' it. Although, as I said before, most of
these women tyre very Ignorant, some of them speak French quite
fluently, but <>f course French is the coun language in most parts of
the world. All Turkish Government papers are made out in French
as well as in the native language.
"The women of this great household are remarkably clever with
the needle; they usually make their own garments, and they are
beautifully made, too. And such beautiful fabrics. I will show you
some."
Hre (he lady showed some of the magnificent presents she had
received from many of the Sultan's favorites. All sorts of em
broidered silks, some of them as fine as a spider's web, and to add
to their value all were woven by hand.
There was one particular article which she said was over a year
in the hands of the weavers. It is a sort of scarf and caniÂ»ot measure
more than thne yards in length by about a quarter m width. This
little bit of vanity is valued ; u $300.
"Have T ever met the Sultan? Yes. indeed. And what did I
think of him. Well, he is a very ordinary looking man and would
be overlooked in the Btn eta of New York or San Francisco. I always
saw him dressed in the very conventional European garb, the only
sign of the Turk being the cap. which was the regulation fez. This
article is worn, of coarse, for religious reasons.
"How many wives has he? Always 2000.
"Why so many? You think he could scarcely remember so many
faces'
"Well, of course not. But there is a saying in Constantinople,
winch I will try to translate for y<n\: 'The size .if the harem is the
t'i. rmometet of wealth. 1 Meaning that a man's wealth is calculated
by the uombtf of women in his harem.
"Are they |appy, these poor creatures? Yes, most decidedly so.
And the larger the harem they belong to the more honored they
consider themselves, of curse this is a condition very hard for us
to understand. But custom regulates all things, and these things are
all according to the custom of the country.
"Is anything like a real wife in the harem? Well, in a manner
y.s; that is. there is one who bears that title, but really she is only
the chi-'f of staff, and has the privilege of knocking thf 'others about
when she feels bo inclined.
"Are the women ever abused by their masters? are they ever
beaten? Well, that is a leading question that I do not care to answer
You know I am about to return to the harem and it is necessary
that I be very careful how I answer your questions. However I
can say this much, and you may draw your own conclusions, 'in
that country the man is master, the woman is but his slave. This
rule is absolute and is observed to the very letter.
"Of course you wonder what I am doing away out here in San
Francisco, and I will explain that. As 1 told you in the beginning, I

years ago:
Well, If it be true, as you assert,
That this is a land for the white man
And not for "niggers," does that import
That our God is the white man's fool?
Two peoples? The hammers and heats

The fates' of the twain In one: we are
For you the riddle of the Sphinx.
And you must solve us. unless again.

Where never falleth the blessed rain.
Hell-dragged you want us to go.

Did not our black limbs dapple the sod
With streams as red as your own?
But not for this do we look in your face.

My brother, give us a. little space
To work in under the skies!
We are not mendicants; we are Souls! â *
The souls that thrilled in Shakespeare,
and
Lit Lincoln's lips with living coals,

We try to use our wings and fly:
We try to use our limbs and run:
Do you hold mortmain over the sky,
Over the earth and sun?
Your apples are of Hesperidrs;
You give us those of Tantalus;
But what if the Lord should blight your

And mock you as you mock us .

of these advanced years of clubs and
mannish dress and golf tournaments had
metamorphosed the "young lady" of the
olden time into the up-to-date athletic

comes to purchasing powders and lotions

sorts of complexion tribulations.
First of all. then, you must have a good
cold cream. Now th:'t strawberries are
in season, suppose you make some straw
berry cream. There really la nothing in
the "way of a cold cream to equal It. It
is one of the most delicate and healing
emollients known to cosmetic science and
will prove unsurpassed as an unguent to
be used for children hs well as d>r older
persons in place of the ordinary cold
cream.
Strawberry Cream,
Spermaceti, one-half ounce.
Retined white wax. one-half ounce.
Sweet almond oil, two and one-half
ounces.
Strawberry juice, three-fourths of an.
ounce.
Benzoin, throe drops.
Take large fresh berries. Wash and
drain thoroughly. Macerate and strain
the juice through a piece of muslin. Heat
the white wax. the spermaceti and the oil
of almonds. Remove from the tire and
add the strawberry juice very quickly.
Beat briskly with an egg-beater until
fluffy and Just as the mixture begins to
cool add the three drops of benzoin. Put
in Jars and keep in a cool place. Apply
every night. You will find this particu

ZOLAâ Your first letter to me was an
swered In the Sunday Call of January 22.
You wrote about freckles, didn't you?
Am sorry, you missed It. A good blood
tonic and' nightly massage with the or
ango llower skin food will, I am sure,
soon put your complexion Into good
shape.
A. T. DESZIRâ The following tonic Is
what you need to make the hair grow:
Forty-eight grains resorcin, one-half
ounce glycerin and alcohol enough to
fill a two-ounce bottle. Apply every night,
rubbing it well into the scalp.
OAKDALEâ I cannot tell you of any
thing save a face bleach that will re
move the outer cuticle from the face.
As the active ingredient In all such
bleaches Is corrosive sublimate, the use
of which I consider risky in the extreme,
I prefer not to give any such formula.
Am sorry.
M. 1,. G., 341â There Is only one sure
way of reducing flesh, and that is by
denying yourself all fattening foods and
exercising a lot and regularly. Get
around and hustle as though something
would happen if you didn't. Get up early
every morning. Indulge in walks and
gymnastics every spare moment. Do not
eat butter In any form and the more
lemonade you drink the better. Avoid
all Btarchy foods, sweets and fats.
EMILYâ I do not know that 1 have any
"'favorite" formula for cold cream. All
those given In this department are good
enough to eat and the following is one of
the iii'st: Spermaceti, one ounce, refined
while wax, one mined; oil of sweet al
monds, live ounces; rosewater, one and
three-fifths ounces; essence of cloves, five
drops. As this recipe will fill an eight
ounce jar, perhaps it would be as well to
Quite a novelty is the overall dress,
made from heavy linen crash, buttoning
at the back. Brown linen trousers and no
petticoats are worn with the overall
dress. Which should be the jolliest kind
of a little knockabout gown for the city
back yard and the country.
A dainty play dress for the house, a
pinafore, a French idea, Is made with low

JENNIE JUNEâ The "hardest thing in
the world to contend with when trying
to put on flesh Is a fretting disposition.
It can make mort- angles and bones than
a diet of pickles, and goodness knows
that can reduce flesh by lightning-like
methods. Why do you worry? Don't do
It. Life is too short to waste time fret
ting and feeling badly about anything,
and you never will be able to fill out any
of .those lines and hollows until you dis
continue that very useless little habit.
What you need Is nourishing food and
plenty of hearty encouragement. Eat
wholesome, fattening foods. Drink lots
of water and plenty of milk; exercise
moderately but regularly, and sleep as
much as possible. Then massage those
ugly little lines with orange flower skin
food. There will bÂ© a special Beauty
Talk on massage soon, with illustrations
showing the proper movements for erad
icating wrinkles. Watch out for it. Try
the following hair tonic: Four ounces
eau de cologne; one-half ounce tincture
cantharides; one-fourth dram each of
oil of lavender and oil of rosemary. Ap
ply to the roots once or twice a day,
using a small sponge or bit of absorbent
cotton for the purpose. Shampoo once a
week while using this tonic. Also keep
the ends of the hair clipped or shingled.
A COUNTRY GIRLâ The electric needle
is the only permanent cure for superflu
ous hair. Of course this is only practi
cable in the case of the coarse scattered
hairs. The soft downy growth that Is to
be seen on nearly every one's face is best
left severely alone.
OLIVE W.â I T se the hair tonic suggest
ed in the foregoing reply to Jennie June.
It will Inspire your hair to more ambi
tious efforts, I am sure, and will not in
the least darken it. I have several times
lately given directions for staining the
eyebrows with a decoction of walnut
bark. Surely you have seen and profited.
However, it is wiser not to use a dye of
any kind on the lashes, as it is very liable
to get into the eyes. Liquid face powders
are seldom used these days, and I would
advise you to get your complexion into
such a state of perfection that it will ac
cept the dry powder, which is vastly
less harmful, as nearly all the liquid
preparations contain bismuth or lead.
Fifteen grains of borax added to one
ounce of lemon juice, if applied to those

MAE G.-An eruption of the skin is a
sure sign of a disordered digestion. Some
part of the physical machinery is in an
upset condition, and bad, impure blood is
the result. Then the skin is sure to be.
made unsightly. The first thing to do is
to make a firm resolution as to regular
exercise and the daily sponge bath. Then
eat neither rich nor greasy food, and do
all that is necessary to make the blood
rich and pure. It is wise at the same time
to bathe the little eruptions with some
harmless healing lotion. Listerine in
three times as much boiled water is very
soothing. After using this for a few days
apply eau de cologne in which is a pinch

Famous Cases of Love at First Sight

man falls suddenly in love he may
fall out of it equally quickly, but
among celebrated men of the cen
tury who have fallen in love
at first sight and married hap
pily are Garibaldi and Bismarck.
In Garibaldi's autobiography the story
of his love is told. He relates how. feel
ing the need of some one who would love
him, and believing women to be "the most
perfect beings," he determined to seek
a wife for himself. He was then pacing
the deck of the Itanarica, and he chanced
to look upon the houses of the Barra, a
little hill at the entrance of the Laguna
of St. Catherine, in Brazil. With the aid
of a glass which he carried he saw a
young girl, and he ordered the men tn
put him ashore. On landing he tried to
find the house which he mid seen from
the ship, but failed, and. meeting an ac
quaintance, he accepted an invitation to
take toffee at his house.
"On entering the house," says Gari
baldi, "the first person on whom my gazo
fell was the one who had caused my com

my children. We both remained in an ec
static silence, gazing at each other like

of yours into better shape. It is very un
wise to cut the little hairs that grow in
the center of the mole. Each time they
are cut they will grow in coarser and
stiffer. A pood dermatologist can re

of the mole with it. making one appli

she will let it alone. A scab will form,

will drop off. taking the mole with it.
The hairs, however, will remain and
must be removed by the electric needle.
'I'll*- latter operation is not as painful na
it is nerve-trying. If you use the acetic
acid yourself be sure not to get any of it
on the surrounding white skin, else a

of the wart lightly with the pencil once
a day. It will turn black and gradually
disappear. As in the case of the acid, be
careful not to get the caustic on any
other part of the skin. A good cold cream
and a pure powder will not injure the

help preserve it. You will find formula*
for both in to-day's correspondence. If

Bismarck's courtship was equally brief.
Bismarck met and lost his heart to
Fraulein yon Puttkammer at a wed

and boldly demanded her. As at this time
he was a wild youth, whose pranks were
the talk of the country. It is not surpris

say, "It was sis if some one had struck
me on the head with a heavy ax." How
ever. Bismarck's love being evidently re
turned, the lady's parents invited him to
visit them that they might know some
thing more about him than report told
them.
At the time of his arrival the parents
were ready to greet the guest with proper
solemnity, and their daughter stood by
with downcast eyes. Bismarck rode up,
threw his arms around his sweetheart's
neck and kissed her before any one had
time to protest. The result was a formal
betrothal.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 21, 1899.
Susan, but Buster John was stirred hy It. Hr> wondered why !t was that
lie should be too young to go fox hunting, and the more he thought about
it the stronger grew the conviction that youth is a hardship invented
to punish children. His views in that respect underwent a great change
tome years later, but at that particular time he was quite sure that
youth was something that h?d to be endured only because there was no
ht-lp for it. His mind was full of fox hunt, and he sought information
on that matter wherever it was to be found. Old Fountain was an au
thority on the subject, so Bustor John was told, and the youngster lost
no time in questioning the negro.
"Uncle Fountain." he said on the first occasion that presented it
self, "they say there s going to be a big fox hunt here Christmas week."
"I hear urn sesso," replied Fountain. "Well, let urn hunt ef dey will:

"Dats so," said Uig Sal, lifting her sad face and looking at the chil
dren.
"I 'member one time." Fountain continued, "dat I went 'long fer ter
look attcr de little Mirster " he paused and began to pick at a
patched place on his knee, and Big Sal drew a long breath. "Now, dar
muz a chap for you!" he exclaimed enthusiastically. "Dey say he died

right now. He's ez big ez a cur dog. Folks tried de'r level bes' fer tor

but he dcs played wid urn. He kin tell a noun' fum a house dog by de
bark, an" time he hear one atter midnight ho done goneâ he done up an
gone. He got a white patch 'twixt his eyes, 'an on 'count er dat dey call
'im Scour-Face."
"Scar-Face." Buster John corrected. "Why, he's the fox they are
going to catch." ââ â
Fountain laughed softly. "Oh, dey er gwine ter ketch 'im? Well, atter
he's cotch. I hope dey'll show im ter me. Scour-Face, er Scyar-Face, I
wantor see what dat white mark is 'twlxt his eyes."
"They are going to bring Birdsong dogs," explained Buster John.
"Well, dey'll hatter sing bird song er some yuther kinder song, fore
dey kotrh dat fox."
"Besides all the other dogs, Joe Maxwell is to bring Hoodoo," remarked
Buster John.
"T hear tell er dat dog," replied Fountain. "Dey say he sho is a
mover. But. shucks! you kin hear dat kinder talk 'bout mos' any dog.
But dish yer Hoodoo got ter have brains ez well as legs ef he ketch ol'
Scour-Fnce. I am tnlkin' now, sho."
"Whero does old Scar-Face fctay, Uncle Fountain?" asked Buster
John.
"You know dat ar broom-sage flel 1 right up yan. cross de road fum de
gin house? Well, he stay right dar. Ef you wuz ter go out er door dar
an' holler right loud, ho'h hear you, less'n he's promenadin' some'rs else.
He been dar dls long time. Dey don't a week pass but what I sees him
slippin' an' slidfn' 'long. He moves dcs like a shadder; once an' awhile
he'll stop an" look at you, but mos' er de time it's fwiff! an" he done gone.
He got sense .same oz folks."
Buster John asked Fountain a great many questions about Scar-Face,
â¢with the result that he made up his mind to see the fox himself. His
curiosity affected Sweetest Susan, and she expressed a desire to see old
Scar-Face. As for Drusllla, she didn't care one way or the other. So
long as there was no bubble and no live nightmares around she was
satisfiedâ at least, she was not contentious; though she predicted now,
as she had been doing all day long, that thp children would "keep on
foolin' 'roun an' gwine whar dey got no business tell some kind er creetur
would snap urn up an 1 walk off wid urn."
It was an easy matter for Buster John and Sweetest Susan to say
they would like to siP old Scar-Face, the red fox, but how to see him
was a very different matter. They might walk through the "broom-sage"
every day for a week, or a month, or a year, and never see him; they
miglit sit in the fence corner and peep between the rails from sunup till
sundown and never catch a glimpse of him. Old Scar-Face would see
them. Oh, yes; no doubt about that. It waa his business to see without
being seen. ' He began to learn that trade when he wasn't bigger than
Buster John's two fists, and by constant practice he had developed it
Into a fine art. Tho shyest and wariest birds could light within an inch
of his nose and never "see him: could light there, but they never flew
away any more. Old Molly Cottontail, all eyes and ears, could sit in her
cozy home and never know that old Scar-Face was in the neighborhood
until she felt his cruel teeth. And even the wood rat, whose keen eyes
fairly glistened with cunning, hardly dared to shake a straw in all that
field "for fear of being pounced upon.
Well, then, how could the children hope to catch a glimpse of this
wild and cunning creature? Aaron was the one to solve the problem
for them, and to Aaron they went. He tamed the White Pig for them,
and had made thorn familiar with the Black Stallionâ that fierce creature
whose neigh was sufficient to stampede the whole plantation. If Aaron
could do these things he could also bring them to old Scar-Face, the red
fox. So to Aaron they went, with many explanations and pleadings.
Mention of the old fox caused Aaron to reflect a little over the past. Ho
had known old Scar-Face when a "puppy." a statement that caused the
children to lauerh.
There is war between the reds and grays, as the Son of Ben All ex
plainedâa war that began many years ago over some family matter.
Fox to fox, the reds can whip the grays, and this fact has become so well
established that the grays always get out of the way when they can. It
happened one day when Scar-Face was a "puppy," as Aaron said, with
big legs and a very wobbly body, he met a big gray in the woods.
Some instinct or other caused the red to rush at the gray, and that was
the cause of the red's scar. The gray would have run away if he could,
but Scar-Face caught him by the flank and held on like a bull-terrier,
while the gray, frightened and hurt, gnawed away on Scar-Face's head
â until the top of it was bare of hide and hair.
It was then that the Son of Ben All charced to pass, and the gray,
with a scream of fear, tore away, leaving some of his pelt between Scar-
Face's teeth. After some trouble Aaron explained to the red that he

meo and Mercutio in the Maude Adams
production; and David Belasco in his
odd hours is preparing a Leslie. Carter
version of "A Winter's Tale." And
thus the good old free and royalf.yless
legitimate bids fair to come into actual
competition with the profane works of
recent playwriters. This is good for
Shakespeare, and also good for the
modern player, who is apt to become a
cramped specialist in these days of
tailor-made parts and long runs. Most
of the actors and actresses that I have
mentioned are immensely popular with
th-- average theatergoer (to whom
Shakespeare in the abstract offers few
attractions), and their legitimate en
deavor is bound to he rewarded by a
curious attention at least. There is
little reason why all actors worthy of
the name should not be able to make a
good showing in the Shakespeare plays.

THE BUILDING
OF
PHANTOM THEATERS
The recent epidemic of romantic drama
has taught them the use of gaudy
clothes and sidearms and a something
of that sonorous elocution that the
Bard demands. These moderns will
perhaps hold in the proper disesteem
those fake traditions in acting and in
terpretation that have done more than
anything else to keep Shakespeare out
of touch with the popular, end-of-the
century theater, and bring about a
nice little renascence of a very musical
and uplifting style of drama. At any
rate the enterprise of the players in
venturing on what for many years has
been regarded as almost fatal territory,
and the grit of the managers in risking
the productions canr.oi ho t<m highly
commended. It is not probable that all
these people will be successful, but if
only a few succeed others will be en
couraged and the ball set arolling; and
maybe the new century will find in
"tragedian" and "classic comedian"
something better than terms of re
proach.

a moral, an intensely dramatic produc
tion, dealing with the fashionable social
life of New York City. That it is an
American play by an American author
and deals with American society is a cir
cumstance altogether favorable in the
eyes of an American audience. It tells a
story of the love of an bonesi man for a

be solemnized in X^w York's most fash

congregation, "the other woman" in the
case, the wronged wife, appears on the
scene, and rushing down the church aisle
calls a peremptory halt to the marriage
ceremony, at the same time uttering an
impassioned denunciation of the groom.
The climax of this act. as the groom
strikes a cowardly blow at the woman he
has betrayed and fells her to the floor,
while his affianced wife rushes horror
stricken from the church, is said to be
one of the most dramatic and thrilling
in the America drama. hi the
last act the tension gradually relaxes
and the audience sees the villain obtain

and love triumph.
At the Tivoli Opera-house "Orpheus

comic opera in three acts, "The Manda

this city. The libretto and lyrics are said
to be written in Smith's best style and the
music is reported tuneful and catchy. The
mandarin of Fuchau, where the scene of
the opera is placed, bears a striking re
semblance to Fan-Tan, a vagabond, and
on this the story hinges. The mandarin
sees Jesso, the vagabond's wife, and falls
in love with her, but the laws of China
allow a man only twelve wives, with
which comfortable quantity he is already
provided. Complications ensue in a rush
ing manner and fun reigns supreme.

which certainly ought to do a big busi

ingly interesting and is told with agree
able and picturesque surroundings. This
production is to be beautifully mounted,
and the costumes, which are exceedingly
handsome, have arrived from the East.

On Monday evening at the Alcazar will
be revived "In Mizzoura." the play which
has been accepted in the West as "The
Old Homestead" is in the far East, and
which is incidentally a much finer drama
than Thompson's. It is a picture of
country lffe in Missouri. It relates the
secret love a blacksmith's daughter had
for a man of evil record and a fugitive
from justice, whose character she knew
not. It also pictures how the Sher'ff of
the play had quietly furnished the erirl's
father with the means for her education
and how he loved the girl Kate and never
told her. It tells that when Kan- re
turned home from one of the Eastern
seminaries she frowned upon him and
scoffed at the thought of marrying a man
so beneath her in education, not knowing

FORECAST OF WIND AND WEATHER IN
THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN FOR ,
JIN) 1533.
Atmospheric equilibrium obtains In June
more than during any other month of the
year.
The area of high barometer; the northeast
tradesâ The sub-chart of isobars and Isotherms
for this month shows an almost permanent area
of high barometer, with center near latitude
40 degrees north, longitude 145 degrees west,
slightly farther to the north and west than
during May. This movement of the high
cause*, the region of the trades to extend far
ther to the northward than during the pre
ceding month. Over the eastern half of the
ocran the trades will be found blowing with
an average force of 4 (Beaufort scale), varying
In direction from north northeast along the
iriPrldlan of 130 degrees to east northeast In
midocean, the polar and equatorial limits ly
ing slightly to the northward of the parallels
of 3o degrees north and 10 degrees north, re
â pectlvely. West of the Hawaiian Islands the
trades will probably be from the east. North
erly and northwesterly winds will replace the
trades between the American coast and a Una
drawn from U5 degn north, 130 degrees W,
to 10 degrees north, 115 degrees west. In the
doldrums, or calm region, between the trades,
â¢which is rapidly attaining its greatest width,
much rain and frequent thunderstorms may be
expected, accompanied by calms, light vari
able winds or squalls.
Occasional cyclonic storms of no great in
tensity may be encountered between the paral
lels of 10 degrees north and 20 degrees north,
along the Failing route from San Francisco
to the line. Heavy thunderstorms are also
likely to occur along the coast of Mexico and
Central America.
The area of low barometer; the prevailing
â westerly winds â To the northward of the Aleu
tian Islands will be found an almost perma
nent low, but of less depth than the correspond
ing area of last month. The general circula
tion of the winds around this low la left
handed, or against the sun. Between thia
low and the^ high to the southeastward there
is a steady movement of the air from west
to east, as evidenced by the westerly and
southwesterly winds. These winds will be
eomewhat lighter In force than' during the
month of May.
Cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulationsâOc
casional spiral circulations, viz., the cyclonic
(In which the winds rotate against the sun),
â with low barometer, and anti-cyclonic (in
â¢which the winds rotate with the Bun) with
high barometer, will be found moving in
a general easterly direction across the ocean.
In advance of a cyclonic area, or low, the
weather is damp, the thermometer rises, and
the barometer falls, while the general direc
tion of the winds is equatorial; in advance
of an anti-cyclonic area, or high, it is dry,
the thermometer' falls and the barometer rises,
while the general direction of the winds is
polar. The progress of these low areas, dis
turbing the mean distribution of pressure, will
give rise to occasional gales between the paral
lels of 35 degrees north and 50 degrees north,
accompanied by rain and periods of foul weath
er generally. These, however, will be less
frequent and of less duration than during the
month just passed.
Monsoons â As a consequence of the fall of
pressure over Central Asia, the southwest
monsoon will be found to have set in on the
southeast coast of Asia and throughout the
Philippines, bringing with it hot, sultry weath
er and abundant rain.
Typhoonsâ The probability of the occurrence
of typhoons has Increased, especially in the
neighborhood of the Philippines and the south
east China coast. The region in which these
Storms are most frequent and the tracks fol
lowed by the various classes are shown upon
the chart.
Fogâ Fog and mist will be prevalent along
the American coast north of latitude 30 de
grees north and throughout the Gulf of Alaska
Fog may also be expected north of the 40th
parallel from the American to the Asiatic coaet,
but with greater frequency north of the Japan
ream.
EASTERN MARKETS
NBW YORK stuck MARKET.
NEW YORK, May LV -Transactions In to
days short session were apparently confined
I'ings by local room traders, who took
a ilny's turn in prices, either down or up.
Prices In the majority of cases are conse
quently little changed from last night. The
of thPlr fluctuations during the two
boors' trading reflected considerable hesita
tion and uncertainty in the most of the trad-
Ing element. The London Exchange -was
eloped foo- a holiday and there were no quo
tations from that quarter to give an Indica
tion of the tendency of prices. Many stocks
opened unchanged in quotation or moved %
either way. Stocks of corporations which en-
Joy franchise privileges in this State were
weak on the prospect of the franchise tax bill
becoming a law, the prospect of material
mi<lln>atlon not being considered likely. The
American Smaltlng stock was also under pres
suis and continued rather weak all day. Ana
conda, on the other hand, continued its show
of strength and ended the day 2hi points high
er. Pugar made an aggressive resistance to
the prasEura against it, and kept above yes
terday's level after the opening decline. There
was a dull resistance to the occasion^ at
tacks of the market In the railroad st\cks,
especially those In the .South and West. Man
ha.uiui and Third Avenue were firm early, but
rallied later, the latter breaking six points.
The bears were disposed to caution in antici
pation of a favorable bank statement, but |
when the market failed to respond to this an
attack on values was made. So little stock
was brought out on the decline that the bears
covered, making the close firm at small I
changes except in special cases. The bank
statement shows a larger Increase in cash then ;
was expected. The heavy contract In loans
was, of course, a reflection In part of the vast
liquidation of last Saturday. As a consequence
the Increase in cash almost all went to swell
the surplus reserve of the banks. There was
.. marked continuance of the recent heavy ab
sorption of new Issues of railroad bunds, the
tape recording several individual transactions
of from $100,000 to $300,000. The stock market
has been so much unsettled during the week by
the contending struggles of the bulls and bears
over the Flower group of stocks that there !
has been llÂ»le opportunity to discern any re- I
flection of general conditions in its movement. '
There was some slight continuation on Mon- |
day of the eager selling pressure on these |
stocks which had been marvelously advanced i
In value under the fostering of the late Mr. i
Flower. Hut the determined and extensive
buying by the deceased financier's associates
In these properties, who had Joined resources
for the protection of values, soon allayed the
apprehensions of timid holders and induced '
the shorts to cover.
The movement toward recovery seemed to
meet with no opposition from the bears not
withstanding the present bear movement aÂ»- :
sumed by one of the largest professional opera
tors in the market. Hut the bear element wns
looking .forward only a short time, as the case
proved, for :in opportunity to attack values.
They of course are not very vigorous In op
position to the reconstruction of values while
it was pursued with set purpose. But the
rise of Wednesday, which brought the Flower
specialists back to or above the prices of the !
preceding Friday before Mr. Flower's death, j
seemed to satisfy the bull element for the
time being, nnd on Thursday there was evi
dence of realizing on some of the large hold
ings which It had been necessary to accumu- i
late earlier in order to check the downward
tendency of the market. This profit-taking
had the advantage of a rising tendency in the
railway list, due to good traffic returns, to
sustain it.
The rise in wheat nnd the talk of crop dam
age caused the railroad stocks to waver, and
then the bears attacked the specialties, notably
Sugar. Brooklyn and the New York Traction
shares with great violence and determination,
causing notable recessions. The tactics thus
engendered caused subsequent dullness. It I
seemed to be demonstrated that the large lines :
accumulated for the lifting 01 prices were held i
over the market under a powerful bear force,
stood ready to take the market from any at
tempt at profit taking. There are.no certain
ties In the general outlook to confirm the
general hesitation of speculation and a dis
position to await further developments to In- i
dicate whether the present level of prices is
consistent with the demand for money, and
there is the inevitable uncertainty regarding '
the crous at this time of the year. Talk of !
crop image has a bearing on the future earn- \
ings of railways, and it Is not an answer I
to this to compare the price of wheat with last
year's level, where the high prices was due to I
the clamor of the whole world for our very I
abundant product. More to the puroose are
the current statistics of railway earnings,
which are well In excess of those of last year
for the grain carrying roads In spite of the
phenomenally heavy movement of wheat at the
time in connection with the Letter deal. Great :
attention is given also to the color of our in- I
ternational trade balance bearing on the
world's money market, recently enjoyed by '
New York. The financial transaction of a $â¢_'"'
--000.000 payment to Spain on Monday without '
exportation of a dollar of gold was striking I
evidence of a residue of our exchange credit I
balance. But the question arises whether the J
residue is not exhausted by this Important
operation and whether the present movement ;
of International trade gives any promise of re
newing it. The rate of exchange on London
had risen ?;c per pound at New York during
the week, and the supply of bills Is reported !
scanty. Imports continue well above not only I
last year's level but above normal of recent
years. Still exports, though far below last
year's unprecedented level, owing to the re
duced prices of breadstuffs, are still well above '
the average for this time of the year, and the
excess of exports for April holds the record
for that month. If last year is excepted
This continued advantage of position is due to
Increased exports of our manufactured prod
ucts. The future of the iron trade also has I
an important bearing on the trade balance. )
The continued upward tendency of iron and I
steel product Is expected to curtail exports In
that line. Under these circumstances the dis
position of the Tendon market toward Ameri
can securities is characterized as a selling !
market, which might precipitate gold exports.
Money is In abundance both at Xew York and
Interior points, and there is no suggestion of â 
scarcity In the Immediate future. There has
l.een large buying of railroad bonds during the
week, the large individual transactions Indi
cating buying for large financial Interests. The
new or contemplated issues for reorganization
or refunding, bearing 3 or 4 per cent interest, I
are the favorites. '

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION. _
NEW YORK, May 20.â Financier says:
The heavy liquidation which marked the Stock
Exchange operations of the week, â¢ particularly '
at the opening, Is largely responsible for the
reduction of $7,243,900 shown in the loan Item
of the current statement of the New York
clearing house banks. The reserve liability,
owing to the slight change In deposits, re
; mained at about the same figure reported for
i the previous week, so that the Increase of
$7,684,600 in cash for the most part went to
i swell the reserve, the surplus rising to $34,
--631,525, the highest point reached since the
middle of last February. In fact the various
i items corresponding to the statement made at
1 that time. The present accumulation of
funds in the clearing house institu
tions is the largest ever recorded. Of
I course the recent rapid increase has been due
1 to the settlement of the Spanish Indemnity
which involved a transfer or twenty millions,
but aside from that the interior banks have
been sending money to this center, and the
: rise in domestic exchange does not indicate
! that the movement is over by any means.
1 The piling up of money here and the conse
quent lowering of interest rates affect ster
ling exchange, but it is thought that quota
| tions will be kept, well below the exporting
'< point. The peculiarly Intrenched position of
the Treasury to regulate interest rates is not
i to be overlooked in this particular. As far
1 as significance can be attached to the cur
| rent statement, the final payment of the Span
ish fund, the stock market liquidation and
the trend of money In the Interior are the only
factors to be considered. The totals are about
I as expected and there is nothing to warrant
expectation of heavy changes for some weeks
to come.

SEEING FAIRIES.
THERE once lived a little girl who
was very poor. Her mother had
been dead for some years, so she
lived with her grandfather. He
â would sometimes go shopping and
leave his little grandchild at home.
Whenever he came home the child
would have his chair, his slippers and
his cap rt ady for him. One day, as she
was sitting in a rocking chair, she fell
asleep. She dreamed that sir-' was
Btrolling through the wood, when :â¢â 
heard a rustle. She looked up and she
saw a fairy descending from tho sky.
At first she was frightened, hut the
fairy told her that he had good news
to bring her. He told her that not far

AZALEA AND HER HARD LESSON.
IT was a fair afternoon In June.
The cloudless sky was a deep blue
and the sun shone with its full glory
and splendor upon the pretty land
scape. It was indeed pleasing. The
flowers were all in bloom; the grass
was green and the birds sang their
sweetest. But fairer than all the flow
ers was a young- girl, apparently about
sixteen summers, who was seated under
a huge oak tree with a book in her
hand. She appeared to be deeply in
terested.
She had auburn hair, which clustered
in ringlets and fell over he broad fore
head, large gray eyes, regular features
and a pretty mouth.
At last she uttered a sigh and her
large eyes wand< r d from the bock, a
dreamy look in their gray orbs.
"I wonder if it is nice to be rich?" she
murmured.
"It is delightful," answered a soft lit
tle voice, and. looking up. she beheld
the owner of the voice, a graceful fairy
dressed very magnificently and dia
monds Hashed on her fingers.
"Tell me your nam<\" tie little crea
ture commanded with a stamp of her
tiny foot.
"Azalea."
"Ah! a pretty nanif and you are in
every way as beautiful :.s the flower
whose name you bear."
"I beautiful?" stammered Azalea.
"Very." the fairy answered emphati
cally, "but you are poor, and beauty
without wealth doc? not se^m con
genial. You are like many flowers that
bear your name, "to blush unseen and
waste their sweetness <>n the desert
air.' You waste your beauty where
nn one will appreciate it. Oh. how
many wealthy people would envy you.
If you were rich you could turn your
beauty to advantat. â *."
"But how am I to get rich?" asked
Azalea.
"Simply by not staying here any
more."
"But I am very happy here," said the
girl, "and I should be loth to leave."
"Loth to lpave this place?" said the
fairy revealing a set of small pearly
teeth in a silvery peal of laughter.
"Wouldn't you like to be very rich?"
she asked in a tone of msinual ng
Bweetness â "to live in a grand house
and have elegant dresses and diamonds
and go to parties and grand balls and
be the acknowledged belle, the envy of
all proud ladies? Think of it: how
lovely it would be! Wouldn't you like
to ho rich?"

said Azalea.
"Your wish is granted," said the
fairy and disappeared.
Looking up presently Azalea found
herself in a beautiful mansion elegantly
furnished, and. looking down on herself,
she saw that a magnificent white satin
dress had 'replaced the calico gown that
she wore, and diamonds and rare jewels
flashed in rich profusion on her hands
and neck. In a mirror she saw her
pretty dark auburn hair dressed in a
way that she had never dreamed of, but
more surprises were yet to follow. Ser
vants flew to obey her slightest wish,
and as the days passed she went into
society and was the undisputed belle!
She was delighted with it and liked the
excitement. As the days flew on she
almost forgot that she had ever been
poor.
Ton wars of her life having nasspfl
away in a richly furnished home, a
i'oung woman sat.no other than Azalea,
yet In her pale face there was no trace
of the lovely young girl who had sat
under the oak tree that June afternoon.
She had married a man that she did not
love and was most unhappy. Shp grew
tired of parties and the sparkle of hap-
piness had departed from her eyes and
th>^ rose? of health no longer bloomed in
her cheeks.
The Azalea hnd withered and its
bright blossoms faded. Her face was
still beautiful, but pale as marble.
"How foolish I Was." she murmured.
"Diamonds and beautiful dresses tempt
ed me. Oh. 1 would give all my wealth
to be. a girl again."
"Are you really tired?" asked a sneer
ing voioe.
Azalea saw the fairy of ten years ago.
"Are yi'ii really tired? And are you
nor happy?"
"Happy!" Azalea echoed, with a hard
laugh. "I am miserabl >." Then she
i hrew hei self on her knees at the fairy's
feet.
'Oh. let me be a happy girl again!"
she cried, clasping her jeweled hands.
"I am so \< : ; --' rable."
"You asked me to let you be rich,"
the fairy answei
"Bui you tempted me a? th*^ s>=rp^nt
tempted' Eve. You told me it was ni<"Â»
to be rich and envied. It is hateful,
and I am tired of It."
The fairy only smiled scornfully, and
as she disappeared Azalea found her
self sitting under th^ oak tree, the sun
was setting in the west and nignt was
nearing. It was all a dream. The cot
of love is better than the palace
of coM splendor.

CARPET DEPARTMENT
That big electric carpet sewing ma-
chine on the fifth floor is a hummer.
It is a marvel in mechanicsâ the only
one this side of the Rockies. It enables
us to lay carpets one to three days
sooner than formerly, and a good deal
better.
Half the first floor is carpets, running
into the rug r#om in the annex. Good
quality carpets, and good light to see
them.
