PARIS ON THE ROCKS,
PASSENGERS RESCUED
SMALL CHANCE OF
SAVING STEAMER
FAX.MOUTH, May 21.â The Ameri- |
can line steamer Paris, Captain
Watkins, from Southampton and j
Cherbourg for New York, struck
on an outlying- ridge of the mana- ;
cles early this morning at a point half!
a mile from where the wreckedâ At
lantic transport line Mohegan lies, and
five miles from Falmouth. The Paris, \
which sailed from Southampton yes
terday, called at Cherbourg and picked 1
up fifty passengers. She left Cher
bourg at 6 o'clock last evening. Soon
after 1 o'clock this morning' at hi^h
tide and in" a dense fog she ran ashore.
From the first there was no danger.
Lifeboats and tugs were soon literally
swarming around the vessel rendering
assistance. A majority of the pas
sengers, who numbered 380, were ]
brought to Faknoufh, where they ob- i
â¼ tined lodgings for the night.
Captain Watkins reported that his
ship was lying comfortably in smooth
water and there was no occasion for ;
any alarming reports. He reported the
passengers and crew all well.
The first: indication. of the vessel's
striking the' rocks was a slight grating |
pound, which was followed by a second
and more pronounced shock. The look- ;
out shouted that the- â  was something '
looming ahead, but before there was j
time to reverse the" engines the ship
had gone on the rocks. 200 yards from
the shore. Assistance was summoned j
by means of rockets, and the coast
guards promptly telephoned to the life- j
paving staticm for boats.
A majority of the passengers were
not aware that an accident had hap
pened until they -were called up by the
stewards. On reaching the deck they
found the ship's boats in perfect readi
ness for their reception. The sea was j
perfectly calm, and the only discom
fort that the passengers experienced j
was caused by the slight rain that was
falling at the time. Owing to the calm- i
ness of the sea, the boats could be man- j
aged with entire safety.
Perfect order prevailed aboard t^he i
vessel. Captain Watkins stood on the !
bridge giving orders, and his perfect
self-possession and calmness of. _ de
meanor had a reassuring effect upon j
the passengers. In accordance with the !
instruction of the captain, the women j
id children were the first to-be taken j
off the ship. Such perfect order was
maintained that a passenger described
the scene as simply a slow procession. of
women and children walking In single
file to the boats.
At daybreak the position of the vessel
could be better discerned. The brilliant
St. Anthony light, at the entrance of
Falmouth harbor, could be dis^^v
guished plainly through the mi styr^||j|jj
and the* still standing masts of '$SiÂ§lÂ«
fated Mohegan could be seen n'.^^
It is said that a Falmouth *' pilot
showed a warning signal to the Paris,
telling the captain that he would put
the vessel on top of the Mohegan if he
did not alter the course of the ship.
The warning, however, came too late
and the Paris struck on a ridge to the
westward of the manacles.
rlt is suggested that as this is only
their second trip from Cherbourg, the
officers of the Paris were not* familiar
with the course. The crew of the Paris
are still aboard the vessel.
It is believed that the steamer, has a
large rent in her bottom In the forward
part of the ship. TugÂ« are standing
by her and will assist in an effort to,, get
her off the rocks.
Further details of the disaster show
that when the vessel struck the
'irr>w were summoned on deck. The
Fusengers appearing were met. in the
companion-way with comforting words
and assurances of . their , safety. Ex
ceptional coolness was shown on all
Bides, the stewards distributing coffee
and stimulants to all who desired them.
Captain Watkins had his gig lowered
The San Francisco Call.
and rowed ashore in order to ascertain
his whereabouts and to telegraph t"
Falmouth for tups to assist his ship.
In the meantime rockets were sent up
and signal guns were fired.
When dawn broke every one on board
was relieved to find the short- on one
Bide and lifeboats lying near by on the
other. The Vessel lay with her head to
the southwest, the reversing of her en
gines having put her Broadside on to] I
thf- rocks. Happily the sea was smooth
and there was no wind. Otherwise
there would probably have been a dif
ferent tale to tell.
Th- dangers of the vicinity were
strikingly brought home to the pas
rs and crew by the masts of the
wrecked Bteamer Mohegan, which are
sticking out of the water, and by a
miserable bell buoy, which tolls almost
constantly as though sounding a death
knell.
When Captain Watkins returned
from his trip ashore he learned that
there was already considerable water
in the hold, and the tugs which had ar.
riv.d stood by in readiness for any
emergency. All the passengers were
transferred to the tug Drago-n, but be
yond the clothes they wore they took
nothing with them. They were landed
at Falmouth shortly a.fter 7 o'clock, the
local agents of the American line meet
ing them and providing them with
every care and quartering them at the
various hotels and the Sailors' Home.
When the Paris struck the tide was
within an hour of the Mood, and this
proved insufficient to- raise her off the
rocks. Hundreds of people visited the
scene during the day.
The passengers are lavish In their
praise wf the admirable behavior of the
rs and crew, and declare that it
was due to their self-possession that
no accident occurred to any one. Per
fect discipline, they say, was main
tained throughout.
It is stated that those in charge of
the Paris were so perfectly confident
that they were pursuing the proper
course that the vessel was steaming
eighteen or nineteen knots an hour
when they struck.
There will be little danger to the
steamer if the long calm continues, but
should the wind veer to the east or
southeast, the consequences might be
serious. The tugs left the scene at
about 0 o'clock.
In connection with the accident to
the Paris it will be of interest to
mariners and travelers to hear that
persist- nv agitation since the wreck of
th<- .Mohegan has at last induced the
Trinity brethren to act, and last week
they promised to erect a gas-lighted,
automaWc sound-producing buoy on the
lpanacles in place c-f the useless bell
buoy now there. Gangs of men on light
ers have gone to the stranded steamer
to take off the belongings of the pas
sengers. It is reported that two for
ward compartments of the Paris are
full of water.
Thomas Allen of London, a passenger
on the Paris, on his way to New York,
says: "I was in bed when the accident
happened. I heard a grating sound, and
then several hard thumps on the rocks
shook the ship. The vessel then seemed
to atop dead. A few minutes later I
luard some one calling, 'All hands on
deck.' I roused my chum, who was
still asleep, and we' went on deck. We
were told to secure our life belts, and
we returned below and got them. We
were not allowed to return to the deck
at that time. All were kept waiting
below. After the first summons a few
of the passengers appeared in their
night clothes, but as scon as they dis
covered that there was no danger they
returned to their rooms and made
themselves ready to leave the ship.
The passengers ail behaved in the best
possible manner, There was no
screaming on the part of the women.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, MAY 22, 1899.
Â£. LONDON, May 22. â All the morning papers comment
f editorially on the accident to the Paris, calling attention to
â¦ the strange coincidence with the Mohegan wreck, in which
1 the loss of all the officers left the posit/on of the ship, so

and the mtrst perfect order was main
tained. We were kept waiting below
for an hour. Coffee and biscuits were
served and then we entered the ship's
boats. Steam tugs brought us to Fal
mouth."
Among the passengers of the Paris
were many poor female emigrants,
mostly foreigners. All have been safely
housed In the Sailors' Home here.
One of the women described her ex
perience as follows: "I was awake
when the vessel struck. I heard a
dragging sound and felt a shock; then
the engines stopped. I went upstairs to
find out what the matter was. I could
see the land quite plainly. I thought
the ship had stopped to take on pas
sengers. I did not think there was any
thing wrong and I returned to bed and
stayed there half an hour. Then a
steward told me to get up. I said:
'There's my baby; don't wake him.'
The steward replied: 'If you want to
save your baby, get up.' I got up and
dressed myself and the baby and went
on deck. We were much frightened,
but there was no confusion. They
treated us in the kindliest planner and
finally brought us here on a tug."
Mrs. Batcheler, a sister of United
States Senator Vest of Missouri, who
embarked at Cherbourg, says the
weather was wet and nasty when they
left port. She retired early, and at
about 1 o'clock was awakened by a tre
mendous crash, which at first seemed to
arise from the machinery. Then every
thing became so quiet that she did
not leave her berth. Soon afterward,
however, she was aroused by a stew
ard, who urged the passengers to dress
and go on deck immediately. Putting
on a few things Mrs. Batcheler hurried
above, and found hundreds of half
dressed passengers there tefore her.
The officers were busily engaged in
preparing the boats for launching and
calming the passengers, though there
was comparatively little excitement, as
it was evident that the ship was not
sinking, and at daybraek all were as
sured by glimpses of the sh<,-re.
Mrs. Batcheler said that some of the
passengers asserted that they heard
Captain Watkins say: "I am tfnable
to understand how this happended."
There was no fog when Mrs. Batcheler
went on deck, but only a misty rain.
The worst trouble, she says, arose in
transferring the passengers in small
boats to the tugs. "The officers and
crew," she observed, "worked like Tro
jans in getting the old people and chil
t dren off, and they certainly deserve
great praise."
PASSENCERS TELL HOW
THE ROCKS WERE STRUCK
FALMOUTH, May 21.â H. W. South
worth, one of the Paris' passengers, an
Englishman, says: "The Paris had
good weather most of the evening, the
moon being about three-quarters full
NEAR THE WRECK
OF THE MOHEGAN
and at the zenith at 9 o'clock. The
weather was misty but not foggy.
When the vessel struck most of the
passengers were asleep. She seemed to
rise, then quivered, grated over the
rock and stood still with a slight list to
port. The shock suggested striking a
derelict or a small vessel! and the pos
sibility of bring on the rocks therefore
was not suggested until the stewards
were heard crying, 'All hands on deck â
captain's orders.' Many came on deck
in their nightclothing. One man wore
his underclothing and his wife's fur
cape, but his appearance caused so
much smiling that his wife sent him
down to dress, which he did in the
music room to the equal amusement of
all. There were no signs of panic.
The soundings showed nine fathoms of
water forward and fourteen aft, but
the ship rested on a flat rock, while the
rocks rising on each side held her al
most erect. The officers' log deter
mined the position of the Paris, and
the position of the wreck of the Mohe
gan shows that the Paris was even
more out of her course than the Mohe
gan, she having passed between the
Mohegan and the shore, and then, when
the mistake was discovered, having
changed her course in the hope of
clearing the rocks thus miraculously
escaping- the manacles."
Captain G. W. McCallum of Pittsbur"
Bays: "I heard a tremendous crash,
and as a steamboat man I knew we
were on the bottom and that if she
slipped from the rock we would be in
Queer street. Hurriedly putting on my
clothing I went upstairs, where I met
the steward, who was shouting, 'All
hands on deck.' As I reached the deck
1 could just make out the masts of the
Mohegan. Officers and crew worked
hard to restore confidence, and the
women seemed calmer than many of
the men. As soon as the tugs arrived
I knew we were all safe, as the sea was
calm and there would be no trouble in
transferring us."
Captain Scott of the ship Kinross
says: "I was bringing my vessel into
Falmouth harbor when the accident to
the Paris occurred. St. Anthtmy light
was clearly visible for five or six miles,
and I heard the bell of the manacles
buoy as we passed. A misty rain was
falling, but there was no fog, and I saw
the line nearly all the way from the
Lizard. It is impossible for me to un
derstand how the Paris got into that
position any better than the Mohegan.
The pc-ssibiltiy of mistaking the St.
Anthony light for the Lizard light is
ridiculous, as the former is a revolving
oil light, low down, and the Lizard
light is two fixed electric lamps on a
high cliff."
Mrs. A. G. Spauling of Chicago says:
"I was well forward and felt the shock.
When I aroused toy maid she insisted
upon staying in bed, exclaiming, 'If we
must drown, let us drown in bed.' It was
Continued on Socond Paro.
REPORTED
SINKING OF
A GUNBOAT
Nicaraguan Vessel San Ja-
cinto Said to Have Fired
on the Detroit.
THEN SENT TO BOTTOM
While the Story Lacks Confirmation
it Is Probable, Owing to the
Priciion at Bluetields.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLON, Colombia, May 21â A rumor
which has reached here from Bocas del
Toro states the Nicaraguan gunboat
San Jacinto fired at the American
cruiser Detroit, and the latter replied,
sinking the gunboat. The report lacks
confirmation.
Bocas del Toro is a town on the island
adjacent to the southern entrance of
th<- great Chiriqui lagoon. This en
trance is also called Bocas del Toro
(bull's jaw, from its peculiar shape).
The town has about 3000 people and is
in Costa Rican territory, as is Chiriqui |
lagoon. The cruiser Detriot is of 2089
tmi? displacement and 18.7 knots speed.
She carries ten five-inch rapid-fire
guns, her main battery and also eleven
six-pounder and smaller guns. No in
formation as to- the size or armament
of the San Jacinto is obtainable, but it
is known that n<me of the Central
American States has a war vessel able
to cope with even an unprotected
cruiser, suih as the Detroit.
WASHINGTON. May 21.â No official
confirmation of the reported engage
ment between the United States cruiser
Detroit and the Nicarguan gunboat San
Jacinto had been received by the
naval authorities up to a late hour to
night. Secretary Long had retired and
could not be seen, but Charles H. Allen,
â¢ Assistant Secretary of the Navy, said
he had heard nothing about the mat
ter.
The Detroit is commanded by Com
mander James H. Dayton. She has
been stationed at Bluetields ever since
the beginning of the existing tn/Ã¼bles
between American merchants and the
Nlcarguan Government over the pay
ment of duties on goods which had al
ready been taxed. The Detroit recently
went to Colon, Colombia, to coal and
to communicate with the Navy Depart
ment, messages from Commander Day
ton having failed to reach Washing
ton. She has just returned, or is re
turning, from Colon to Bluefields.
Standard books on naval subjects do
not contain any reference to the San
Jacinto, but she is probably a very
small vessel converted from a yacht
or tug and not an actual man of war.
The existing difficulties in Nicaragua
are the outgrowth of the recent rebel
lion in the Department of Zelaya, of
which Bluefields is the capital. Colo
nel Reyes, head of the revolutionary
movement, opened the Bluefields Cus
tom-house and proceeded to levy
duties at the rates charged by the
"government. There are large Ameri
can interests at Bluefields, chiefly in
the hands of the Bluefields Steamship
Company of New Orleans. American
merchants paid duty to Reyes on con
signments of goods received during the
revolution, and after it had ended
through a mutual agreement between
Reyes and the government the latter
insisted that the American merchants
should pay the duties over again. The
merchants refused to pay and were
subjected to persecution by Colonel
Torres, the new Governor of the de
partment, who had once been removed
after the Corlnto trouble on the de
mand of the United States. Torres
hates the Americans, and he did not
hesitate to show his dislike. Mer
chants were advised by the United
States to pay the extra duties under
protest and trust to the refunding of
the money through diplomatic means,
but declined, and, sealing up the ware
house in which the g00d.9 were stored,
raised the stars and stripes over the
buildings. Colonel Torres then called
the attention of the merchants to the
law of Nicaragua that no foreign flags
should be flown except over legations
and consular offices or on national hol
idays. The merchants said they did
not give a rap for the law and kept
Old Glory on the poles.
Torres was evidently afraid to open
the warehouses forcibly while the
American flag was floating over them,
and the goods were not seized. Final
ly it was arranged between Nicaragua
and the United States that the duties
should be paid over by the merchants
to the British Consul at San Juan del
Norte or Greytown and held by him
pending diplomatic adjustment. This
was satisfactory to the merchants, and
the matter is now being discussed dip
lomatically.
The feeling engendered by these in
cidents has been bitter, however, and
Americans are not popular in Nicara
gua. Owing to her draft, the Detroit
has been unable to get within several
miles of Bluefields, and the converted
yacht Vixen has just started from
Hampton Roads for Bluefields to give

HUNDREDS MADE
HOMELESS BY THE
FIRE AT DAWSON
Hardly Enough Provisions Saved
to Prevent a Famine in the
Klondike Capital.
VICTORIA, B. C, May 21.â The
immense conflagration , which
wiped out three-quarters of the
entire area of, Dawson, the Klon
dike capital, on April 26th was a
terrible a*nd awe inspiring sight. Tok
las, the mounted police driver, who ac
companied the adventurers, L. F. Hume
and Thomas P. Reilly, who brought out
the new:; of the fire as far as Bennett,
with the intention of selling it, says the
scene was almost indescribable. In an
incredibly short time after the fire
originated, the whole area occupied by
what is known as the water front strip.
Front street from Timmins' Royal Cafe
to the Fairview Hotel, the area between
Front and Second streets and contigu
ous buildings were a mass of leaping,
crackling flames, which lighted up the
snow-clad ranges at the back of the
city as though a whole range of vol
canoes had suddenly erupted. This
district is considered the very heart of j
the business section, and in a few hours
after the fire began all that was left
of the one hundred and eleven buildines
and mercantile establishments which I
stood there was a heap of costly debris
and charred embers.
The cause of the fire was the same as
in the majority of the fires which have j
taken place at the Yukon capital â the
explosion of a kerosene lamp during a i
drunken debauch in a disorderly house j
a few doors from the opera house. Two j
; of the female inmates, Toklas says, had
j a fight in the house and in the scuffle a
i lamp was dashed to the floor. Before
their licfuor-confused brains could grasp
what had happened the cabin was in
flames.
Pedestrians passing at 3 o'clock in
the morning saw flames shoot from
the windows of the building, and a
moment later several women and four
I drunken miners rushed into the street,
i two of the unfortunate females with
their ciothing on fire. In another mo
ment the cabin was a sheet of fire, and
the strong north wind then prevailing
caught up the fire and fanned it
against the adjoining buildings. Soon
the block was a sea of dancing flames,
which roared like a furfiace as the
heavy winds blew them along the
street.
Those who were on hand when the
fire broke- out from the cabin where it
had its origin, instead of calling out
the fire brigade, made an abortive at
tempt to subdue the fire. Thus a dis
astrous delay was occasioned, which
allowed the fire to gain considerable
headway. When the fire brigade ar
rived the conflagration was beyond
control.
With the scanty supply of wafer
available and the insufficient appara
tus the citizens were powerless and be
came demoralized. For a few mo
ments they stood aghast, watching the
fire rushing along the streets *- the
heavy gusts of wind swept down from
the mountain ranges back of the city
and drove it along in sheets and clouds
rather than flames.
When they rallied they soon saw that
it was as useless to endeavor to stay the
more immediate protection to Ameri
cans and their interests.
Granting that the report front Colon
is true, it is not likely that war be
tween Nicaragua and the United
States will result. If the San JacTnto
fired first, as reported, this Govern
ment will probably demand an imme
diate apology and the payment of
heavy indemnity, and will permit the
matter to pass with that. Nicaragua
is not likely to make a commotion over
the incident. _
LONG'S INSTRUCTIONS
TO GUNBOAT VIXEN
Navy Department to Be Constantly-
Informed of Conditions in
Nicaragua.
NEW YORK. May 21.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Under in
structions given by Secretary Long to
Lieutenant Commander W. W. Kimball,
commanding the gunboat Vixen, now on
her way to Bluefields, Nicaragua, that
officer will maintain constant telegraphic
communication with the department.
This order is in addition to that requir

conflagration, which rushed along like
pent up waters released by a broken
dam. as to endeavor to pump out the
Pacific, and they devoted their time to
the salvage of property and efforts to
remove buildings in the path of the ad
vancing tongues of flre, to thus stay its
progress.
The excitement was awful. When it
seemed that the town was doomed
panic ensued. Hal^-crazed men and
women ran backward and forward,
scarcely knowing what they were do
ing in their terror. Then the frightened
citizens joined in a mad stampede.
Hundreds fled to the snow-covered hills,
where they stood watching the flames
eating up all they possessed except the
clothes they stood in. Nothing could be
done, for when the fire had gained con
trol it was dangerous to approach. At
intervals explosions occurred, hurling
the logs from the burning buildings as
though by a whirlwind. Several men
were injured by the flying logs, one be
ing struck on the head. His skull was
fractured and he may die. As far as
can be learned the fire did not cause
any loss of life, but Toklas says rumors
were going the rounds when he left
Dawson the morning: after the fire that
several persons had been burned to
death. The rumors could not be veri
fied before he and his companions left.
The names and descriptions of the
buildings destroyed, further than those
given yesterday, could not be learned.
The damage will amount to over
$4,000,000, about $1,000,000 of which is in
gold and paper money lost in the de
struction of the two Canadian banks.
There is little if any insurance. Much
of the gold will be recovered, however,
by the banks. Toklas says they are
panning and sluicing the ashes. Be
fore the embers had time to cool the
managers of the banks had engaged
miners to wash up the ashes and the
debris was panning out richly.-
Great suffering' will be caused by the
fire. Hundreds are destitute. Fortun
ately, though, says the mounted police
man, the two big- stores of the com
mercial companies escaped untouched
with their contents. The stocks of
these companies '.ill be severely taxed
in meeting- the demand for necessities,
all private stores of food and clothing
within the radius of the fire having
been destroyed. The companies have
not advanced the price of provisions,
being determined to do all they can to
relieve the general distress. Until the
river opens it is useless to think of re
building-, for there is not over 3000 feet
of lumber in the entire district and
there is a dearth of all building sup
plies. D. Carmody has left Lake Le
barge with four barges of supplies.
The steamer Flora is on her way
through the ice.' She was fast at
Hootalinqua when the trio of couriers
passed.
The women who upset the lamp
which causea the catastrophe and the
other inmates and occupants of the
house have beeen arrested. It is ex
pected that they will be severely dealt
with.
ters. 'Lhe gunboat Marietta and latterly
the cruiser Detroit experienced consider
able difficulty in forwarding messages to
the department and receiving instructions,
due according to the rxpla nation of th..
Nicaraguan Government to an "Interrup
tion" in land lines. Lieutenant Com
mander Kimball will send frequent dis
patches relative to the situation and the
department therefore will be kept con
stantly informed of conditions existing on
the Central American coast.
It is not at all certain that the cruiser
Detroit will leave Central American wa
ters even upon the arrival of the Vixen.
Her departure is entirely dependent upon
the condition of affairs at Bluehelds at the
time the Vixen is spoken, and should th
situation be quiet, the department may
deem it advisable to dispatch two vessel's

the indemnity for the murder or an

CONTEST FOR
SPEAKERSHIP
Men Who Want to Get
Reed's Place.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 21.-The Wafhlne
ton correspondent of the Herald tele- |
graphs: Representative Hopkins of nn
nois, one of three leading candidates for
the Speatoership of the ib-us.- of Repre-
Bentatives in the Fifty-sixth Congress, ar
rived 1 in Washington 10-nlght to look after
some matters In departments for his con
stituents, and incidentally to advance uls
campaign for the Siu-akership.
Representative Lorinier of Illinois, who
it was expected would manage the cam- i
tor Mr, Hopkins, has been 111 and
may not be able to take an active part J
in the contest-
Mr. Hopkins Bald to-nigrht that ho was
receiving many encouraging letters from
I Republican representatives-elect in all
parts of the country, also so encouraKin^
in fact as to justify him in expressing
; the .utmost confidence In hi,s Buceess. He
said it was too early to give detailed In
formation as to State delegations or Indl-
Is, but he was assured of support
from the East as well as from the VWst.
The Speakership campaign has not yet i
.; down sufficiently to justify the as
sertion that either me of the three prin-
I cipal candidates is in. the lead. There are
rumors of deals of various kinds which
would involve the delivery of blocks of
to this candidate or that, but it is
not possible that any such deals have
i been detiniu-U entered into.
One of the reports is that Mr. Sherman j
Mr. Henderson have agreed that after
i the first trial of strength in the caucus
! the onr who is shown to be the weakest
withdraw in favor of the other, and
Is then to be made chairman of the Com
mittee on Ways and Means and the lead
er of representatives on the floor of the
House. Letters which Mr. Sherman and
Mr. Henderson have written to their most
I intimate associates do not indicate that
', anything of tho kind is on foot.
Another report is that Mr. Payne is re
! maininp in the race for the purpose of
turning: his support over to Mr. Hender
son at the right moment and being con
- tinued at th<- head of the Ways and
- Committee In return for this ac
, lion.
As a matter of fact few members of the
Republican caucus have yet committed
themselves finally as tit their choice for
Speak.'-. Most of them are waiting for
consultations with their colleagues in va
rious Stat.- delegations, and the final ac
tion of many will be governed largely by
their judgment as to their prospects for ,
securing coveted committee assignments
with this or that man for Speaker. Thus
! far the Illinois delegation is the only one
which has been consulted, and th.- repre
s.-natives of that State have determined
to give their solid support to Mr. Hopkins.
gh there has be. n no consultation of
[owa delegation, it is known to be
Id for Mr. Henderson.
There is much speculation among the, i
friends of various candidates as to the
plans of the Quay leaders in the Pennsyl
vania delegation. Representative Bing
liam of Pennsylvania has been put for
ward as their candidate, and It is wdl un
derstood that he is to be used merely to
hold the delegation until it can be deliv
to Th>- best advantage in return for
committee places and House patronage to
tin man who will be elected. It is not
improbable that this â  will hold
the balance of power In the convention,
and the report that its support was to bt_'
given to Mr. Henderson lias been the
' ground for much of the confidence which '
the Henderson men have been showing in
the past few days.
GIVES ADVICE TO
STANFORD SENIORS
Baccalaureate Sermon
by Dr. Brown.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 21.â
The new assembly hall was used this
morning for the first time when Rev.
Charles Brown of Oakland delivered the I
baccalaureate sermon to the graduating |
class and Its friends. Work had been
rushed on the building for the past few
weeks in order to get it into shape for
comnn-noerm-nt week, and although it is
not entirely finished it was thrown open
to the public. The hall seats 1500 per
sdhs and there is standing room for
many mure. Nearly every seat was ta
ken 'when the speaker arose and an
nounced his text, taken from Revelations
xxi-16: "And the city lioth four-square and
the length is large as the breadth. The
length and the breadth and the height
of it are equal."
It was a masterful address both in con-
Btrui tion and in delivery. He likened the
1 human'life to the city that lieth four-
I square. As the city was equal on all sides
I So man must develop, not in one direction,
but- in all. With Matthew Arnold, he di
vided life into four divisionsâ conduct, the
power of knowledge, beauty and socia!
fife. Said he:
Conduct Is the doing of things that are
rightâ to be pure and kindâ to stand before
God in reverence.
Knowledge Is the ability to read and riro-
I duce something, the ability to study nature
I and man. Wo mean by knowledge the ability
:to know literatureâ not books or prints, but the j
â  great masters.
U '.. stand before the great architectural j
i buildings of Europe; before tho gn-at paint- !
! ings and sculptures of* the masters, and we are j
! filled with the idea of the beautiful. Beauty <
n essential factor In man's life.
Social life is of the utmost Importance. So
cial relations are of the holiest. Social life
makes us more tender-hearted and sympa
thetic
These four powers look in all directions.
Aftt-r discoursing at length on these di- 1
visions, and pointing out the Jewish na
tion as the one strongest in its conduct; !
the Greeks fnr their knowledge; the Ital- j
ians for beauty, he said no nation had j
been particularly strong in its social life,
but he thought the Anglo-Saxons were
I tending that way and that ultimately our
religion would be one of ethics instead of
theology or dogmas.
The speaker then turned to the grad- :
I uating class and gave it a tew words of
counsel. He bade the graduates go out
Into the world with a large view of
j things.
"Do the things that you know are right.
: Get knowledge. Get wisdom."

BEREFT OF WEALTH AN AGED
WOMAN GOES TO POORHOUSE
Pitiful Fate of Mrs. Caroline Cox of Bridgeport,
Coon., Wl}ose Secor)d hjusbaod Secured Her
portuoe ai)d a Divorce.
NEW YORK, May 21. â -A Bridgeport (Conn.) special to the Herald says: Mrs. Caro
line Cox, once a widow with a fortune of nearly $100,000, but now penniless, was sent
to the poorhouse to-day. Yesterday her real estate was taken from her on an execu
tion issued to satisfy a judgment of nearly $10,000 given by the Superior Court. Mrs. Cox is
75 years old and comes of an old family. Her father was Matthew Curtis, a prominent man
fifty years ago. and her husband, John Thompson, amassed a fortune in Bridgeport's earlier
days in the paint business. When he died he left his widow a large estate.
Mrs. Cox soon after her husband's death was attracted by a "Personal" in a news
paper. W. H. Cox, who was then in New York, advertised for a wife. She answered the ad
vertisement. Cox met her, and the widow became smitten. They were hastily married. Then
Cox proposed that they spend their honeymoon traveling about the country. He persuaded
her, she declares, to mortgage her home for $12,000. Later, while on their trip, he con
vinced her, she says, that she ought* to advance him $10,000. This she did, giving a blanket
mortgage on her property.
Cox after getting the greater part of his wife's wealth went to California and brought suit
for divorce. Mrs. Cox still loved him, and went to San Francisco to oppose the divorce. The
decree, however, was granted, and Mrs. Cox returned to Bridgeport heartbroken.
Since then she has lived alone in the old homestead. Her taxes have been unpaid, and
gradually all that remained of her property has dwindled away. She will probably end her days
in the poorhouse.
FILIPINOS
SPARRING
FOR PEACE
But the Commissioners Have
No Power to Act Without
Aguinaldo's Consent.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IÂ£&9, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, May 21.â official con
ference of the Filipino Peace Commis
sion did not materialize this morning.
Aguinaldo's four representatives saw
Otis and requested time to have the
American Commission explain the pre
cise meaning of our proclamation and
form of government the United States
will give them. The indications are
that they will return to Aguinaldcr for
further instructions, though they say
they will meet Otis with a full commis
sion officially to-morrow, submitting
their desires.
Zialoita, In an interview with the
Call-Herald correspondent." stated they
wanted a cessation of hostilities and in
dependence, but refused to say whether
the commission would ask this.
Judge Advocate Alberto Barretto, one
of the Filipino commissioners, had an
interview to-day with the American
Philippine Commission. The meeting
was approved by General Luna, the in
surgent commander, who is thoroughly
in accord with Aguinaldo in his efforts
to obtain peace. The primary object of
the interview was to ascertain the kind
of government the United States pro
poses to establish here. The Filipino
commissioners have no power to effect
a settlement, but must refer all matters
to Aguinaldo.
Autonomy is the burden of the talk
of the Filipinos, and it is thought that
the kind they wish for could be little
different from the scheme of an Ameri-
I can protectorate which they talked of
before the war. ;', "Â»" './-.-.
Senbr Paterno, who has succeeded the
irreconciliable Mabini as President of
the Filipino so-called Cabinet, is a stu
dent and a writer of ability. He once
drew up a plan of autonomy under |
Spain which the Spanish Government
promised to adopt, there being a trou
blesome rebellion on foot. The Ameri
can Commissioners, in studying the
question of the Filipino Government,
have found several good points in the
scheme. Paterno is about the strongest
man in Aguinaldo's party. - -â¢. '
All the moneyed leaders of the insur
rection see that it Is hopeless and are
anxious for peace. Those who want
money think hey may profit by har
assing the Americans a while longer.
On the suggestion of Mr. Schurman,
president of the American Commission,
the local Filipino peace party has start
ed a newspaper.
Major Kobbe's expedition to open
communication with General Lawton
! has occupied Arayat, about seven
I miles beyond Candaba, on the Rio
! Grande, taking the course of the
i stream. No insurgents were found
| there, and the Pamaganis along the
' river are friendly.
Last Friday Major Kobbe took Santa
Ana, about six miles northeast of San
Fernando, on the road to San Isldro.
! A priest met the expedition with, a
| white flag.
Delegations from San Nicholas and
Santiago, small villages just south of
j Arayat, came to him with the news
j that 200 insurgents who had been hold
â  ing both places, had withdrawn. They
i invited the Americans to enter, and as
the members of the expedition marched
in the church bells were rung, and the
I timid natives who had fled flocked
i back.
Twenty-five native militiamen at
Bacolad have deserted to the insur
gents, carrying their arms with them.
General Smith, commander at Iloilo, re
ports that he has decided to disarm the
remaining militiamen. The Third Bat
i talion of the California regiment will
I start for Negros to-morrow.
PROPOSED TERMS FOR
UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER
NEW YORK, May 22.â The Journal
prints the following from its Manila cor
respondent: In an interview with Gen
eral Gregorio del Pilar, in the presence of
Dr. Robair, a close friend of Aguinaldo,
and another peace commissioner. Zlal
dta, who approved the sentiments ex
pressed, General del Pilar said: "The in
surgents are anxious to surrender, but
I want the assurance first that there will
| be no putting to -death of leaders in the
rebellion, and some proof that the Amer
i icans will carry out the generous state
| ments in the proclamation. We have
i been acquainted with the Americans only
a short time. If they are sincere, why
we will agree to unconditional surren
der." ___________

PASSENGERS RESCUED
Continued from First Page.
with some difficutly that I persauded
her to go on deck, even when rescue
was assured."
Henry Wilding, managing: agent of
the line, who arrived from Southamp
ton this afternoon by special train to
arrange for the transportation of the \
passengers, said: "I have had no op
portunity to inquire as to the facts,
and certainly have no theories to in
dulge in. The Cherbourg stop was
adopted some time ago and was by no
means unusual. Captain Watkins is
one of the most trustworthy officers on
the Atlantic, and I must await the re
sults of the investigation before pass
ing any judgment."
To-night the Paris lies* in much the
same position as when she struck, her
bow being 150 yards from the shore and
her stern about 200. Almost in a direct
line and about a mile ahead lies the
wreck <rf the Mohegan. Just outside the
bows of the Paris Is a great ragged
rock, and a ridge of rocks project into
the water 200 yards aJiead.
There is about sixteen feet of water
in the three forward compartments,
but the engines are apparently un
harmed. It has been decided to await
special salvage apparatus and the next
tide to-morrow. The sea Is still smooth
and the work of lightering proceeds.
STRANDED STEAMER
REMAINS ON ROCKS
FALMOUTH, May 21.â An effort was
made this afternoon to tow the Paris
off the n.vks. Three tugs were en
gaged at full pressure, with the steam
er's steel hawsers and her own engines
assisting for half an hour. The at
tempt was entirely unsuccessful, the
steamer not budging an inch.
Pilot boat 13 claims to have saved the
Paris from the Manacles. She wa's on
guard duty near the rock, and when she
saw the lights of the Paris she showed
a flare. The steamer starboarded her
helm to clear the cutter, thus escaping
the Manacles.
ADMIRALTY SENDS
AID TO THE PARIS
PLYMOUTH, May 21.â The Ad
miralty has sent several fast Govern
ment vessels from Devenport to assist
the Paris. Among the vessels sent to
the assistance of the stranded steamer
is a gunboat, and Admiral Sir Edmund
Robert Fremantle, commander-in-chief
at Plymouth, has ordered a number of
torpedo-boat destroyers to hold them
selves in readiness to proceed to the
scene of the wreck at a moment's no
tice.
LONDON, May 21.â Mr. Curri-, Lon
don manager of Richardson, Spence ut
Co., said to a representative of the As
sociated Press this afternoon:
I am not yet in a position to explain
the mishap to the Paris nor to apportion
the blame. If any responsible agent of
the company is on the spot investigating
the facts will be known in due time. At
present I only know officially that the
Paris ran on the rocks at half-oast 1
this morning during a thick, drizzling
rain.
I rejoice that nobody was even hurt. The
cargo is now being discharged on light
ers and the prospect is favorable for sav
ing the ship if fine weather continues. I
hope she may be refloated fit high tide,
about 3 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Admiral Fremantle's dispatch of two
gunboats to the scene is not the less ap
preciated because of the fact that the pas
sengers, mail and baggage had already
been landed before their arrival. Our
great desire now is to satisfy the passen
gers in regard to their future movements.
A large portion have already arranged to
sail by the St. Paul.
HOPEFUL VIEW OF
VICE PRESIDENT WRIGHT
NEW YORK, May 2\â At the office
of the American Line in this city to
day Second Vice President James A.
Wright made public all cable dis
patches bearing on the disaster to the
Paris as soon as they were received.
Early in the day Captain v Frederick
Watkins of the Paris cabled: "Paris
went ashore 1 a. m. Sunday, off Low
land Point; lying comfortably. Smooth
water."
Lloyd's agent at Falmouth cabled:
"Paris near Manacles; weather foggy;
water calm."
Another cable from Falmouth gave
information that tugs were around the
steamer and that the passengers were
being landed. Mr. Wright also received
word that Mr. Wilding, the agent of the
line at Southampton, had gone to Fal
mouth.
From the cables received Mr. Wright
took a very hopeful view of the affair.
He said that Captain Watkins' cable
seemed to Indicate that the steamer
was not damaged.
During the day there were only two
inquiries made at the office for pas
sengers on the Paris.
The New York of the American Line
will take the place of the Paris, sailing
from here a week from Wednesday.
She is arranged the same as the Paris,
so those who have engaged passage on
the Paris will occupy on the New York
the same staterooms that they secured
on the sunken vessel.
COAST GUARDSMEN
HASTEN TO THE PARIS
COVERACK, May 21.â One of the
coast guardsmen at Ooveraek has made
the following statement to the corre
spondent of the Associated Press:
It was 1:25 a. m. to-day when I discov
ered the lights of a steamer close inland,
just over the wreck of (he Mohegan. I
Immediately fired a rocket, which was
responded t<> in a few minutes by the sig
, rial gun of tin- Paris. Chief J.-ffers of the
: coast guard summoned his men and
' manned the lifeboat. Unlike the case of
the Mohegan. the Paris could be easily
srf-n. The rocket apparatus was prepared
! and the first shot failed to reach the ves
sel, but the second fell across her bows
' and was quickly fastened.
In the meantime the Port Jloupter life
boat and the Kalmouth tugs responded.
There was a heavy ground swell running,
| with a southwesterly breeze, and it was
very hazy.
On reaching the Paris Chief Jeffers
â  found Captain Watklns of the Paris main
. tainirrg the best discipline. There were
; no signs of a panic. The starboard boats
I of the Paris Were swung ready for launch
ing; all tli" women and children were be
inn collected together, and the prompt ar
i rival of the tups facilitated debarkation.

HAS BEEN A MOST
UNLUCKY VESSEL
The last disaster to the Paris Is only
one in a chapter of accidents that have
occurred to her in the past five years. On
February 17, 1594, while on* the Irish
coast, the breaking and dropping of a
heavy piece of machinery came near pend
ing her to the bottom of the sea.
On her passage into New York from
Newport News, where she had been for
repairs, Murch 30, 1596, an accident very
similar to the present one occurred and
only the nature of the ground saved her
from being lost.
While proceeding in a dense fog up the
Ship Channel she ran on the bank about
900 feet northeast of Quickstep buoy, off
the Long Island shore, with much force,
firmly imbedding herself in what was
fortunately soft material. It required the
removal of all of her water and coal
(2000 tons) and the aid of several powerful
tugs for her to be drawn off again at
high water. On her trip across to New
York in the early part of January, 1897,
she had a screw disabled and made her
return trip with but one screw.
The reported capture of this vessel
April 24, 1898, off the Irish coast by
Spanish cruisers as she was on her way
to New York just after having been
chartered by the United States Govern
ment occasioned much excitement for a

CAUSE MANY WRECKS
The Manacle rocks, on the Cornwall
coast, where the Paris was wrecked, lie
about one and a half miles off the shore
about half way between Falmouth and
the Lizard, and are about ten miles north
east of the latter point.
They have been the scene of many
wrecks, the most noted lately being that

13, IS9B, when a number of lives were
lost.
They have been marked by a "bell
buoy," and the British Government h-ia
just made provision for an electric beacon
to be placed there. The City of Paris wis

IS THE FIGHT
TO BE A FAKE?
The Big'Uns Are Doing
Little Training.
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, May 21.â Among the fol
lowers of the prize ring, the conviction is
being strengthened that the coming fight
is not to be all that it should be as a
championship affair. Down at Asbury
Park Jeffries is whiling away his time
with an occasional boxing set-to with
Tom Ryan, welterweight, but severe
training has not thus far been indulged
in. He is. to say the least, taking things
remarkably easy for a man who, within
three weeks, expects to meet the acknowl
edged champion heavyweight of the
world.
Fitzsimmons is still at Bath Boach,
when he is not on Broadway. The lanky
Australian is always in fair condition.
Perhaps he is good enough to be able to
whip Jeffries without any preparation. Be
that as it may. his present training meth
ods are peculiar. He is either careless of
his honors or confident that his condition
will not affect his chances when he next
enters the ring.
Early last week one of these two fight
ers stood at the bar of a Broadway hotel
for several hours, drinking with friends.
A little later he was found asleep on a
bench in Madison Square. Those who
should have been fitting him for his com
ing contest took him in charge and hus
tled him out of public sight. The next
morning he took a long bicycle ride, but
refused to indulge in any other of the
training routine.
This escapade was so unusual a per
formance, the fighter having enjoyed the
reputation of being one of the few of his
kind who drink little, that it attracted
more notice than was pleasing to the
managers of the Coney Island Club. They
sent out agents to deny the truthfulness
fif the story, declaring that Fitzsimmons
and Jeffries are both training as never
before.
William A. Brady, manager for Jeffries,
and Martin Julian, manager for Fitzsim
mons, are interested in and practically
control the Coney Island Sporting Club,
a fact which in itself does not tend to in
spire confidence. George Siler, who will
act as referee, occupied a similar position
ai Carson City when Fitzsimmons dis
covered Corbett's â¢ solar plexus. After
that battle Brady denounced Siler In un
measured terms and said that under no
circumstances would he allow Siler to ref
eree any fight in which he had an inter
est. Now Brady accepts Siler as a referee
for his man Jeffries without a murmur.
Betting on the coming battle is not be
ing indulged in to any extent.
HALE THROWS
UP THE SPONGE
Prison Directors' Hint
Quickly Taken.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. May 21.â
Warden Hale has thrown up the sponge.
No longer will the head of the prison
maintain that the policy of Captain Edgar
in refusing to incarcerate convicts under
suspicion of engaging in a conspiracy to
murder guards is not reprehensible.
"Jack" "Wilson was placed in the dungeon
yesterday evening and probably will be
in solitary confinement when Martin
Aguirre is installed warden.
Mr. Hale's tacit admission that he wa3
in the wrong was due solely to the action
of the Board of State Prison Directors at
Folsom yesterday in adopting a resolu
tion that any convict found in possession
of a deadly weapon shall be thrown into
solitary confinement and kept there until
his. term expires, without regard to its
length.
Last Friday Wilson. was taken to Edgar
for a breach of prison discipline, and on
the way tossed an eight-Inch dirk knife
Into a corner. The act was witnessed by
Guard Ben O'Neill, who called Wilson's
custodian, Fred Werner, back and pointed
out the knife.
Priur to this occurrence Captain Edgar
had been petitioned by Guards Leahy and
Yoho to place "Frisco Slim." Wilson,
Neill and Phelan. four desperate prison
ers who had threatened the live? of offi
cers and guards, in the dungeon, but Ua.l
met with a refusal. Captain Birlem in
terceded at the request of the. guards, but
was given no satisfaction owing to the
erroneous opinion of both Hale and Edgar
that Birlem had been supplying the pa
pers with "inside" facts concerning prison
affairs.
When Wilson was detected carrying a
dirk the attention of both Hale and his
right bower were drawn to the event,
which was cited as proof that the prison
ers were armed and ready for trouble.
The man was not even placed in solitary
confinement.
When the resolution of the board was
adopted at Folsom, Hale doubtless was
made acquainted with the turn in affairs
by telegraph, as he receives a private
telegraphic service of important news
events daily. Anyhow, Wilson was placed
in the dungeon Saturday evening and re
mains there yet.
Guard James McDonald, who was
stabbed by Oppenheimer, is fast improv
ing, and Dr. Lawlor thinks he will re
cover. A splendid constitution and in
domitable will power have produced what
the physicians regard as closely akin to a
miracle.
MRS. ELLEN GRIFFIN'S
WILL IS CONTESTED
SAN RAFAEL, May 21.â The first gun j
of what probably will prove to be a nota- |
ble legal battle was fired Saturday when
the law firm of Keys & Allen filed an op- :
position to the will of Mrs. Ellen Griffin
of Tomales. The estate involved is va
rlously estimated to be worth from
$100,000 to $150,000..
The husband of Mrs. Griffin was a i
Marin County pioneer and died at To- !
males about ten years ago. He was
deemed the wealthiest man living in that
part of the county. His widow died a
few weeks ago. and her will was tiled for
probate on the 4th inst. The buik
of the estate was left to Mrs.
Kate L. O'Connor of Ban Francisco, :
a- daughter, and the remainder was ap
portioned among her other children and :
grand-children, to the exclusion of James
L. Uriffln, a son, and J. F. and Ellen G.
Mulvaney, grandchildren. The latter
two are the children of P. Mulvaney, a
hotel-keeper.
The contest is brought by Keys & Al- {
len in behalf of James L. Griffin and the
two Mulvaney children, who are repre- I
sented by their guardian, P. Mulvaney. i
It is alleged in the complaint that the de- j
cedent did not sign the will herself and !
was weak in body and mind a long time i
prior to death. Mrs. Kate O'Connor, the ;
executrix under the terms of the will, is
charged with using menace and fraud to
accomplish her object in procuring the |
disinheritance of the son and grand- I
children.

MARSHFIHLP. Or., May 21.â Captain
Judah Barker, a pioneer of California and
also one of the pioneer settlers on Coos j

RANCHERS FIGHT
IMPROMPTU DUEL
Foes Meet While Hunt
ing Squirrels.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, May 21.â Two Whitman
County ranchers met while squirrel hunt
ing on. Friday afternoon. They renewed
an old quarrel and got up an impromptu
duel. Each fired three shots and each
was wounded. A special from Colfax
gives these details:
John Mohr, a well-known rancher, yes
terday called on Dr. Stunt to have a bul
let extracted from his body and another
wound in his neck dressed. He said that
while hunting squirrels on his ranch on.
Friday, Lewis Henderson, who was plow
ing in an adjoining field, shot at and
wounded him. On Saturday afternoon
Lewis Henderson, accompanied by <J. H.
Brumfield, came to Colfax and made com
plaint -against Mohr. charging him with
having shot at and endeavored to kill
Brumfield. The latter's story was that
Brumtteld was hunting squirrels, and
while passing in front of Mohr's place a
bullet struck in the road at his feet.
Brumfield saw Mohr about 100 yards away
crouched behind a fence and endeavoring
to take sight at him for another shot.
shouted at him to desist and
T-tegan dodging about to destroy Mohr-i
aim. As M"hr continued to threatj X
Brumfield raised his rifle and shot at his
assailant. Each man shot three time?,
when Mohr dropped his pistol and ran to
his house.
Mohr and Henderson had trouble sever
al months ago and recently Mohr threat
ened to kill Henderson. No warrants were
issued.
KAPPA CHAPTER OF
ALPHA PHI FORMED
Young Women of Stanford Univer
sity Organize a New Fraternal
Society.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 21.â
An event of much interest at Stanford is
the founding of the Kappa Chapter of
Alpha Phi. The members are Miss G< ex
trude Mackintosh, class of '98 (candidate
I for a master's degree In Romanic lan
â¢ ftuages): Misses Lottie Brand, Clara Earl,
i Bessie Henry. Helen Holmes, Elizabeth
; Pratt, Marion Reynolds, all ot '00; Misses
Lucy France and Mary I. Lockey of '01,
Misses Amy Ferguson and May Hurlburt
Of "02.
The initiation, followed by a banquet,
took place at Escondlta Cottage last
evening. The rites of initiation were eon,
ducted by Miss Gertrude Payne, acting
preceptress of the State Normal School
at San Jose; Miss Martha* Constance
Smith, instructress in English at Stan
ford, and Miss Harriet McCaslay, for
merly fellow in history at the University
of Chicago. The colors of the new society
are bordeaux and silver. Its pin is a
jeweled monogram. Other chapters are
I located at Syracuse University, North-4^
j western University, Boston University,
I Depauw University, Cornell University,
i Minnesota University, Baltimore College
for Women, Michigan University and the
University of Wisconsin.
The fraternity has never aimed at a
; large membership and has been extremely
! conservative in the placing of new chap
> ten=. H is thought that the establishment
of this, the first chapter west of tlv Mis
sissippi, has been assisted, by the fact
that Miss Smith is an intimate friend of
the national president of the order.

PHYSICIAN
Flight of Mrs. Isaac Brown
and Dr. J. A. Sacry of
Santa Paula.
TWIWF.S WICKED
Basin ss Man's Wife Becomes
Infatuated With a Man of
Medicine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA PAULA, Slay 21.â Mrs. Isaac
J.rown, wife of Santa Paula's leading
Business man, has eloped with Dr. J.
A. Sacry. Love [or the physician sup
planted affection for the husband when
Mrs. Brown was an invalid same
months a^o, and was attended by Dr.
Sacry. She deserted a happy home and
brought sorrow upon a man who has
the respect of the entire community,
while the physician left behind a
broken-hearted wife.
On a Sunday evening Dr. Sacry
quietly departed for Los Angeles. On
I-'Â»e Monduy evening fo.. owing Mrs.
rown left for Los Angeles. Her
idden departure, following so closeiy
thai of Sacry, treated considerable
ilk. It soon became known that
le two wore on an elopement
tour. The fact that is was deliberately
lanned is borne out by the move-
Lents of the interested persons. Sacry
)ld hi? horse and buggy several days
revinus to his departure. He pos
ted but few persona] effects, which
2 carried away with him. Mrs. Brown
lok all her personal belongings, such
5 jewelry and wearing apparel. These
ere taken as baggage. She had packed j
luch of the chinaware and other
lovable articles at her home. These
le left at the railroad freight station
i await forward instructions.
Brown seemed to be aware that his
ife intended to leave himâ that she
id transferred her affections to an.
. her. They had been married six
?ars. Brown was unable to prevent
. is wife leaving him, and he did not
â¢~ object to her taking both the personal
and mutual effects.
Soon after the train pulled out on
Monday evening Brown learned that
his wife was on her way to meet Sacry.
Upon receiving this news he imme
diately called upon the Southern Pa
cific freight agent and topped the ship
ment of the goods.
The faithless wife dealt a cruel blow
to her husband in sending direct word
to him by her sister, Mrs. N. W. i
Blancharu Jr., that she had gone to
meet Dr. Sacry. The couple met in Los
Angeles. Presumably they are at pres
ent in San Francisco. Upon their de
parture Sacry was supposed to have
had in his possession about $250. while
she â¢ id $40, besides her jewelry and
clothing.
Sarry is a middle-aged man. probably ;
40 ysars old. Mrs. Brown is 30 years old.
Sacry haJ ben practicing his profession
here for six months. It is supposed he
hailed from St. Louis. Mrs. Brown be
came acquainted with him while un
dergoing medical treatment. During
the month previous to their departure
Sacry called at her home very fre
quently, ostensibly to give medical aid.
She called at his office for medical ad
vice. In this manner they became quite
intimate.
Isaac Brown, the deserted husband,
conducts the largest grocery store In
town. He is very successful in busi- I
nes3 and exceedingly popular. Mrs.
Brown is the eldest daughter of Captain
fC. A. Fernald of the late Company E.
Seventh Regiment, National Guard of
California. Her sister was recently
married to the only . son of N. " W.
Blanchard, the orange and lemon
grower. _ ____________

: Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, May 21.â The Masons of

candidates in Cryptic rite, on the top
!of Pikes Peak in August. Followers of
; the wise King have concluded that next
tn the ancient temple of King Solomon,
' built without the sound of hammer or

vuus in Kansas City. The first special

the neiehborhood of their respective head
qoarters.
!'!â¢ sident Keefe of the International
Longshoremen's Association, who arrived
t"-<hiy and held -several consultations with
the strikers, said to-night he would not
be surprised if thr men were all back
at work within the next forty-eight
h<'i^iÂ«. To-day a committee from the men
waited upon Bishop Quigley and he re
newed hjÂ« advice that they return to
work. Some of the monthly men returned
to work to-day.
So far ns the freight-handlers are con
cerned, their differences are practically
ended ;^ul the men probably will go back
to-morrow. The scoopers also have been
advised to do likewise and the majority
of them are in favor of taking Bishop
yuigley's advice.
GETTING TO
WORK ON THE
MONUMENT
Some New Ideas for
Dewey's Statue.
IMPORTANT MEETING TUESDAY
VARIED SUGGESTIONS AS TO LO
CATION TO 3E SELECTED.
One Man Who Thinks It Would Be
Good to Use StonS From the
Admiral's Native
State.
The next meeting of the "Committee to
Erect a Monument to the American Navy
In Commemoration of the Victory of
Admiral Dewey at Manila" will be an Im
portant one, for there will then be set
tled the approximate amount the commit
tee -will attempt to raise and also the
manner of raising that amount.
From the way the idea, has found the
public fancy and from the enthusiasm it
has inspired, it has become apparent that
the committee need not stint itself. Sums
ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 have been
suggested and the limit seems to be
prompted by a thought of what the tax
payer will have to boar in the improve
ments already contemplated rather than
what sum the committee will be able to
gather. There will be no trouble in gath
ering either of the sums suggested, bo the
committee has a wide range to choose
from.
As to the method of collection there
arc various ways suggested, but nothing
will be done until some banking company
shall have been selected for treasurer.
There is a general idea, however, that
some method by which every one would
find it easy to contribute, should be adopt
ed. Collectors are not altogether accept
able to several members of the commit
tee, but all seem to favor a proposition to
establish collection agencies all over the
city where the willing may contribute be
fore they can spend the patriotic dollar.
The location of the monument is an
other subject of discussion. Should it be
in the city or at the park, and if in the
city should it be down town or up town
or on the street or in some square? There
an- all kinds of possibilities in this situa
tion and they are being thrashed out by
the members of the committee as well as
th.- public at largeâ for every one seems
willing to take a hand in the enterprise.
Ex-Mayor Pond believes the monument
should be placed in some such place as
' Union Square. He thinks, too, that be
| tween fifty and one hundred thousand
dollars would be sufficient. "The people
will be called upon for a good deal in the
near future." he says, "and I don't think
i the amount should go above $100,000 in any
case."
There are others who have a different
opinion, however. Charles L. Patton be
lieves in putting as much as possible into
the monument. "It is the greatest victory
of niodern times we arc commemorating,"
he says, "and we should see that our mon
ument is far above anything ever at-
tempted here. Lick guv.- about $100,000 for
the statue in front of the City Hall, and
at> a city we can certainly afford to give
at least half as much more. I believe, !
anyway, that unless we do this thing In
the proper way we had better let It alone.
Let us spend all the money we can get so !
long as we pet the full worth of what we
spend. I believe in a downtown site. too.
A site in one of the parks. The monu
ment would then be nearer to the people
in their everyday life.
"There is another thing. This monu
ment ought to be the result of the sub
scriptions of all the people of the city.
\\ â  should have some form of receipt
which would be in the nature of a souve
nir. There are a great many who would
not care to keep such a thing, but there
are as many more who would value such
a thing and keep it fur years. There
might also be an entertainment of some
kind. People like to attend such enter
tainments, for it allows them to work off
surplus patriotism and cheer and yell to
their heart's content. Then, too, it might '
be made a feature of the Fourth of July ';
celebration. To dedicate this year's cele
bration to the victory at Manila would be
a thing to take the public fancy and would
bring home to the people that they have
some hand In the building of the monu
j ment as well as the committee. So far as
the unveiling of the monument is con
cerned I believe it should be set for the
Ist of next Mayâ Dewey day. It will take
| all of that time for the preparation of the
plans, the selection of the design, the
modeling, the molding, ' the casting,
the building of the pedestal and
the collection of the money. If
we could unveil the monument as the
feature of the next Dewey day pro
gramme we would be ahead of thorn all;
it would show the people of the country
that Western patriotism is of the active
kind."
Thf* following suggestion is submitted
to The Call by a man who is personally j
acquainted with the great admiral:
MILLS COLLEGE, Cal., May 19, IS9O.
San Francisco Call. San Francisco: I have
Just seen to-day's Issue of your valuable paper
and most heartily apj.rove of the proposition
to erect a heroic statue and monument for
Admiral Dewey. whose great achievement at
Manila lifted a tremendous burden of anxiety
from the minds and hearts of hosts of people
on the Pacific Coast. Dewey's victory saved
the Pacific States million? of money that would
have been expended for defense If he had i
failed to destroy the Spanish fleet. I would i
suggest that the principal stone In the monu- i
ment be of the beautiful granite which abounds
In the immediate vicinity of Dewey's native
place In the Green Mountain State. Vermont
granite Is the foundation of the everlasting
hills, and Is the right material to commem
orato the memory of George Dewey and the
battle of Manila Hay. Yours truly,
B. S. XICHOLS.
It might be a graceful act to have the
capstone of the pedestal, if practicable, or j
some part of it, of the Vermont stone, !
but the monument would be a Californian '
offering and the general opinion is that
It should be of Californian material. It '
has also been suggested that tho
I statue be made in part of metal
i obtained from some of the guns captured
by Dewey, but again it is believed it is
better to have any captured g-uns mount
ed as part of the monument. There is a
grim significance in a rusty old gun, es
pecially when it has been captured.
Funeral of R. G. Sarg-entson.
The remains of Richard Godfrey Sar

were burled from Odd Fellows' Hall yes
terday afternoon. Sargentson was a well
known character about the Wisconsin
Hotel, where he lived during the last
eighteen yearsâ ever since he came to this
city. For nearly twenty years he was cut
off" from the light of day, the result of an
explosion in a Michigan mine. Sargent

MISSIONARY STEAMER JOHN WILLIAMS:
THE London Missionary Society has been blamed for all the trouble in Samoa. Robert Louis Stevenson, when alive,
attacked the missionaries through the London press, and his stepson, Lloyd Osborne, when the present trouble broke
out, did not hesitate to reiterate his stepfather's statements. The society's steamer is the John Williams, and
she is now on her way to Samoa via New Guinea.
The London Missionary Society began the Chistianizing of the isles of the seas in 17%. and during that time ten ves
sels have been worn out in its services. Of these four have been named the John Williams, one the Messenger of Peace,
one the Endeavorer and the first one engaged in the service one hundred years ago the Duff. The John Williams left
Brisbane for New Guinea on March 11 with .supplies for the missionaries. After visiting the various stations in New
Guinea she will go to Samoa and to all missionary stations in the southern seas. During the cruise her captain ex
pects to make 25S landings with surfboats and stop in seventy different harbors. She is a beautiful vessel, fitted with
luxurious staterooms, reception rooms, mailroom, dispensary, offices, deck saloon and all the accommodations of an
ocean liner.
SCHOOL WINDS
UP WITH THE
HORRORS NOW
Those Awful Written
Examinations.
Tho School Department is all agog over
the recent order of the Board of Educa
tion requiring written examinations in
several of the primary and grammar
grades at the end of the school year, now
near, on which examination promotions
to the next grade are to depend. The
plan is supposed to be mainly Superin
tendent Webster's.
â Whatever the merits and demerits of
the scheme, the teachers of the depart
ment kick, sniff and sneer at it, as a rule,
ami wag their tongues much about it
among themselves. They smile at the
congratulatory observation of a member
of the board that something progressive
and up to date had been done. The sud
den and unexpected thing worries them,
and it worries many of the pupils. The
teachers worry because the examination
papers will have to go to the Superin
tendent's office to be picked over as evi
df-nce of their teaching abilities, and it
worries many of the pupils because they
meet a new condition of promotion and
because a written examination i? a horrid
thing any way. The first practical result
is that a general and hurried review of
the ground gone over is on and a general
cramming for a written examination has
begun. A minimum percentage of (50 in
every subject and a minimum average of
70 are required for promotion.
The general average of the opinion cur
rent In the department everywhere is well
expressed as follows by on of the oldest,
and best-known teachers:
"Instead of being progressive the idea i 3
one that has been dropped for years by
progressive educators everywhere. It
was dropped in San Francisco some ten
or twelve years ago and there have beers
no written examinations for promotion
since. Promotions have been made on
the records, reports, classroom work and
general proficiency of the child during 1
the year. They have largely depended on
the "teacher's knowledge of thi' child's
character, abilities, needs, etc. The judg
ment of a teacher who has been in the
classroom with the pupil for a year is
deemed a better guide than the written
answers to ten questions. It has been my
observation that about two-thirds of the
pupils are yearly promoted actually by
their teachers and in addition some are
! advanced conditionally.
"Where the plan is used at all in the
best Eastern schools the results of the
I examinations are made but part of the
! conditions for promotion, and then only
in the higher grades. The system creates
teaching for examinations and not for the
development of the child, which is quite
I a different thing. If the teaching is for
I examination the teacher will select what
j is most likely to be covered by the exam
ination. If you teach for the develop
ment of the child you take into consider
ation many things not covered by exam
i inations. An examination doesn't deter
! mine the character of the child, his in-
I dustry, perseverance, etc.
"When a pupil's promotion depends on
his whole year's record he has a constant
incentive to effort and excellence. When
â  he knows that he Is to be promoted on
: examination he is apt to take things easy
and then cram up for examination. For
another thing, written examinations put
a premium on dishonesty. It is impossible
to conduct a written examination in a
crowded class-room without dishonesty.
They quickly get cheating down to a sci-
I once and show great cleverness and in
| genuity in it. 1 have known a boy to
| work out a whole problem on a small bit
of tissue paper, make, a pellet of it and
snap It cl^ar across a room. Tf promotion
depends on getting the answers many will
noi scruple as to how they get them. The
! clever boy who cheats may easily make a
! better record than one who is greatly his
! superior in scholarship."
Stabbed in a Fight.
Eddie Hlnes. a 13-year-old boy living at
313 Filbert street, was taken into the
Harbor Receiving Hospital last night suf
fering from a knife wound in the left
breast He claims that the wound was
inflicted by Jlmmle Thomas, a 19-year-old
newsboy, while the two were fighting at
the corner of Montgomery avenue and
Filbert street. The injury, which was
very slight, was dressed by Dr. Fitzgih
bon'. Mrs. Hines. the boy's mother, says
she will swear out a warrant for Thomas'
arrest this morning.
Beaten in a Tunnel.
Alexander Kirkwood. second officer of
the collier Mineola, walked into the Har
j bor Hospital last night to have several
| ugly cuts and bruises about the face and
body dressed. He said that he attended
the picnic of the Eagles and while the
train was passing through the tunnel
near Greenbrae a crowd of men set unon
him and after beating him went through
his pockets. Thomas Holland was ar
rested and charged with battery. He is
believed to be one of the men who as
saulted Kirkwood.

THE MONUMENT COMMITTEE.
\A AYOR PHELAN has chosen well and wisely
/â  \ in selecting the gentlemen who arc t<> take
charge of the mpfement i<>r ihe erection of a i
monument to Admiral DJTwey. Th* work is an mi-:
ne, and â 'â â¢ I strong public scfttiment
in its favor it will not be brought to success without I
ise of energy, tact and business sagacity of a \
irder.
The committee is a strong one in every respect. Its
I members not only h,old high positions in business and \
â  in social circles, but arc men of such ability, influence :
' and leadership they can count upon a large following
I of earnest supporters in the task they have under-!
'! hi i! very names carry weigh! with them, j
Whai citi en can doubt the < accomplishment of an
enterprise entered upon under the direction of Mayor
Phclan, frying M. Scott. F. W. Van Sicklen, C. L.
Pattern, C. 11. Murphy, diaries Bundschu, W. (i.
ford, J I). Grant, Leon Sloss, E. B. Pond,
rge D. Clark, Joseph S. Tobin, Fran!-. J. Symmes,
J. B. Reii I â  . K. 1 1. Fletcher, R.
t verin, E. W. Hopkins and Horac< G. I'latt.
The committee has organized by the election of
Mayor Phelan president, Claus Spreckels and [rving
M. Scott vice presidents, and Captain R. 11. Fletcher
secretary. Each and every member of the committee :
; has not only consented to serve but has exhibited no j
i little ardor and enthusiasm in the movement. There
will be no laggards or recalcitrants among them.
Â£ach and all will work with an eye single toward the
success of the enterprise and with perfect harmony of i
i sentiment on all essential points of the undertaking.
While of course no details have yet been fixed con
cerning the monument, it is well understood it is to be !
I one of the notable monumental structures of the i
country. It has been suggested that atÂ«least $100,000
will be required to defray its cost, and it is possible 1
that sum may be largely exceeded. The members of j
, the committee are reported to be sanguine they can
r.Â»ise the money needed in a comparatively short time.
The movement appeals, of course, not to San Fi
. cisco only, but to all California; and, as a matter of
fact, to the whole Pacific Coast. It i^ to be a mani- i
! festation by the people of this portion of the Union
of their appreciation of Dewey's great victory and an i
evidence of their recognition of its far-reaching im- i
nee to the Pacific Coast States.
The success which has attended the efforts in the
East to raise money to purchase a home for the hero
; in \\ n will of course stimulate Western
r in the movement for the monument, as Pacific
C. asi people are not likely to let those of the East
i cutdo them in the generous task of doing honor to .
the victor of Manila Bay. The prospect of the move- j
ii ent is therefore bright from every point of view, and i
. with a committee of such force to direct it there can .
W little doubt it will go forward with rapidity.
THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI CONGRESS.
WHEN the Trans Mississippi Commercial Con
gress assembles for its tenth session, which is
to be held at \\ ichita beginning May 31, it will
hid before it a wide range of subjects to consider and
many issues along which it can hope to do useful and
1 the call for the congress it is
said, indeed, the discussions arc to I>e confined to
is of common interest to the territory repre
sented, but that leaves a wide field for both oratory
and action.
The issues which will be taken up by the congress
are: Irrigation and the arid regions, improvement of
Western rivers, water transportation, transportation
facilities of the West, our trade and how to ii
it. mining in the West, agriculture, national quaran
tine, statehood for the Territories, the Monroe doc
trine, homestead laws, trusts and combines, our for
issessions, the election of United States Sen
ators ami representation of the West at the Paris ex
ion.
:i programme of discussioH is calculated to
catch public interest in every direction. Many of the
â  properly treated by
â¢ lercial congress. There is no reason why time
be taken up with discussions' of the Monroe
doctrine, our foreign possessions, the election of
United Stat< s Senators, and several others " ;
iar sort which in their nature are more political than
cfiniir.fr
If the congress by organized co-operation, or by
influencing pul : ' sentiment and shaping popular will
can do anything to improve the transportation facili
ties of the West, advance the cause of irrigation and
forestry, promote the enactment of legislation which
will build an Amerii an merchant marine for the trans
port of American goods to foreign markets, and
other measures of a similar nature, it will serve a
much more useful purpose than it can do by using its

FORESTRY WORK IN THE EAST
IZLIJROM New York comes the announcement that
r* the State College of Forestry Cornell Uni
the State College of Forestry at Cornell Uni
versity has just replanted fifty acres of the
burned over lands of the \dirondacks with white pine
and other conifers, and lias started a nursery with
.enough seed to cover 2500 acres with seedlings two
years hence. It is further stated that hereafter the
college expects to replant at least 500 acres of the 'bare
lands every year, until all have been reforested. '
; The interesting feature of the report is the evidence
it give- of the increasing force of the movement of re
foresting the burned over and denuded tracts of land
in the more progressive States of the East. It is but
a short time since no effort whatever was made to re
plant the burned forests of "New York. The State
College of Forestry is something in the way of a new
experiment. This year it has replanted fifty acres,
but within two years it will have young trees enough
to replant' at least 500 every year. That is surely a
rapid advance and is a striking evidence that the ex
periment is doing well. \.
It is not in New York only, however, that extensive
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 22, 1899.
replanting of destroyed forests has been undertaken
in the Ea^t. Pennsylvania as well as New York has
Income an owner of forest lands and is experimenting
in forestry on a large scale. In Minnesota and Wis
consin, where rich pine regions have been made bare
either by the :i\ or by fire, extensive replanting has
been done. In fact. Minnesota has had her forestry
i roblems examined and reported upon by experts in
the science and the practice of tree planting and will
probably undertake the work of renewing her forests
upon so comprehensive a system as to serve as a
guide and model for all other States where anything
like similar- forest conditions prevail.
While most of the States have not taken anynot
tcps in the direction of scientific forestry, or of
any adequate care of the forests that remain to them.
yet in nearly all of them the subject is now engaging
the attention of earnest and thoughtful men. The
campaign of education in favor of forest preservation
has begun to achieve successes in all parts of the
Union. The people are beginning to understand
more and more dearly the importance of the issue and
â¢lv of applying a remedy to the evil
< : the carele >-. ;ting of our noble woods. As the
New fork Sun says, in commenting upon the work
Â«'one by the State College at Cornell :
"Timber is like wheat or any other crop. If we
wish to harvest it again and again on the same land
we must grow it there. The timber limits are prac
tically fixed by the immutable laws of climate, and
particularly of rainfall, and our forest resources
therefore are not inexhaustible. With our enormous
population and vast demand for lumber it is easy
enough to denude thousands of square miles and to
destroy the supply of the most desirable woods faster
than unaided nature can replace them. But if we
treat our forests half as well as we treat the other
forms of vegetable and animal life that enrich us, they
Â«re just as inexhaustible as the cattle on our plains or
the fishes in our lakes and rivers."
RAILROADS IN CHINA.
A RECENT publication of the Treasury Bureau
'â : Statistics, entitled "Commercial China in
1899," shows in a Â»trikinp, way the rapidity with
which that long closed empire is being opened up to
the trade and traffic of the outer world. At the pres
ent time upward of 6000 miles of waterways have been
declared open to steam navigation by the vessels of
all nations, and there are about 3000 miles of tele
graph wires in daily use.
It is in the statistics relating to railroads, however,
that the revolution of the commercial conditions of
the empire are most impressively shown. At the
present time only about 300 miles of railway are in
Operation in all China, and yet over 3000 miles are
now projected, and conccs:ion- for them have been I
granted. They will be pushed forward of course with j
much rapidity, for the builders and managers are all ;
eager to get ahead of one another and reap as much j
profit as possible from being first in the field.
Nearly every important nation in the world is in
terested in these railway projects, either directly or
through its commercial representatives. Starting
from Manchuria, the extreme northeasterly depen
dency of China, is a projected Russian line to con
nect with the great Russian trans-Siberian railway,
now nearing completion, which will bring its great 1
traffic to the ice-free ports of Port Arthur and Talien-
Wan, on the Gulf of Pechili. To this proposed Rus
sian line the Chinese Government has already given
assent, and work upon it is in progress.
As this Russian line passes so near to points where i
American and British commerce is established, Brit
ish capital lias arranged for the construction of a road
from Shan-Hai-Kwan, already touched by a com
pleted line from Peking to Tientsin, to Newchwang,
thus giving a ready railway communication with the
capital, the great port of Tientsin, and thence toward
the Yangtse Valley, where the British have arranged
with China that there shall at least be no concessions
in favor of any other Government, and which valley
i- thus by Borne, though with doubtful propriety,
termed a "British sphere of influence."
While the Russians arc building lines through the
north, the French are constructing them in South
China. In Central China nearly all nations have a ;
share, but the British have the larger number and the 1
more important concessions. Belgium, however, is j
not far behind, as her representatives have a conces
sion for a line from Peking to Hankow, the most !
important interior city in the empire. The road will
be 050 miles Ibng and it is said will traverse a country j
rich in mineral as well as agricultural resources and j
inhabited by upward of [00,000,000 people.
American concessions for railways are said to be I
confined up to the time the report was prepared to a !
line which is to connect Canton with Hankow. In j
reviewing the subject the New York Tribune recently I
said: "This line, which is about 000 miles in length,
5 through a rich and important agricultural j
<n, having a population equal to that of the
United States, and at its center taps an important
iron' and coal area. The direction of the proposed line
i- almost due north and south, and while it practically
touches the seaboard at its southern terminus, where
it reaches the Yangtze at the north is several hundred
miles interior, thus bringing to the great port of Can
ton the products of the upper Yangtze Valley, which
section. is quite similar to that of the Upper Mississ
ippi in our own country."
It will be seen that China is about to make an im
mense stride in the way of internal development. We
shall have the paradox that the most stagnant of na
tions is the one which makes the swiftest march to
innovation. A change from a railway mileage of less
than 300 miles to one of over 3000 in about five or six
years will eclipse anything ever done even in this
country.
Mrs. L..M. X. Stevens, president of the National
Woman's Christian Temperance Union, considers it
a matter worthy of comment that Governor Gage has
defeated the will <^\ the people in depriving cities of
the fifth and sixth <!a-s of the privilege of voting for
license or not. When M r.s. Stevens has been a lit
tk longer in California she will look upon Governor
1 - violations of public rights not as matters
worthy of comment but as matters of course, to be ;

nia get another chance at hi> Excellency.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The statistics of the mineral production
of the State for 1898 as compiled by the
Mining Bureau and published recently in
The Call became more Striking and sig
nificant by a comparative showing. The
record for live years shows a steady In -
crease of approximately (2,000,000 a year
during the past five yeacjs.
It cannot be doubted that the ratio of
increase will lie vastly greater in the fu
ture, beginning with this year. The total
of ov< r (27,000,000 of "raw material" added
tq the wealth produced by the State
makes the greatness of . the industry
: stand out In a prominent way. The total
i is. of course, small compared with the
totals of the fifties, when placer gold ran
, the record up to sixty or seventy mil-
I lions, but that was gold practically alone.
Gold now is but little more than half the
mineral product, and there are thirty-five
other mineral substances produced com
' mercially in quantities worthy of record.
The fact that the gold product of 1898
wa i practically the same as that of 1897
in spite of the drought that hi
tlmated to have caused a shortage of
from $3,000,000 to (5,000,000 in the yield il
lustrates the greatly increased activity of
I last year. This, and the much greater
activity of this year, including the great
Increase In the number of producing
mines and the doubling and trebling of
the scale of operations in many others,
gives a sure promise of an increase of
several millions in the output for 1899.
The copper boom with the opening of so
many small copper mines throughout the
State and the greatly enlarged scale of
operations by the Montana Copper Com
pany will forge the copper product ahead.
There never was BO much prospecting
for petroleum and so many discoveries
in npw oil fields as now. The asphalt
production will soon show a large in
crease. The conditions are favorable .or
enlarged output of such now compara- ;
tively unimportant products as antimony,
marble, slate, coal, sulphur, etc.
Some of the striking features of the
record are shown by accompanying dia
grams There are now five products
which amount to over $1,000,000 annually
âgold copper, petroleum, quicksilver and
borax. Asphalt has increased In five
years from 1233,800 to $4^2.17:.. Silver be-
Ing almost entirely a by-product of gold
mining, remains at about the snmo_ fig
ure through the recent yearsâ ?4l4,O;Â».> for
1898 The quicksilver product remains
nearly stationary, from year to year. It
was $1,188,626 in 1898. Borax has increased
from JSuT.SiiO in 1894 and $595,900 in 1895 to
$1 iÂ£3,000 in 1898. There Is a boom at hand
in nearly every phase of the industry.
The museum of the State Mining Bu
reau has more than doubled its aver
age daily attendance since moving to the
Ferry building in February. Ever since
then Curator Durdon and his experienced
assistants have been busy with the ar
rangement of the specimens in the wall
and show cases and the work is now
practically completed. The collection j
crowds all the available space in the long 1
and light hall it occupies on the third ]
floor and makes a very attractive and
quite imposing array. Two years ago
there were 15.000 specimens in the collec
tion but now only about 10,000 are dis
played. The collection has been improved
by the reduction.
'in past years there were a great num
ber of things which were simply curious
suitable to a popular museum like that or
Golden Gate Park, but having no rela
tion to the mineral world. Many of these
-were given to the park some time ago.
Many others belonged to the late Jacob
Z I 'avis, who was so long a trustee and
who took a great interest in the institu
tion Besides his valuable mineral con
tributions there were several hundred cu
rios such as ancient arms and South *>ea
things which were simply loaned. The
heirs have removed these. There used to
be a collection of stuffed birds and these,
too. have gone to the park. There are a
number of these curios left to interest the
casual visitor, but the collection has been
made almost entirely a mineral ono. As
such it has been improved by culling out
duplicates and specimens of small inter
est or value. It now delights between
four and live hundred visitors a day.
Many are merely curious visitors and
many are people intelligent in mining.
As the display of the State Board of
Trade is on the same floor in the other
half of the building the two institutions
mutually increase their attendance. There
is also "an Increased attendance at the
library i The collection is steadily grow
ing and is also being improved constant
ly by the substitution of better speci
mens.
During 1888 the Selby Smelting Company
deposited over $21,000,000 in refined gold at
the San Francisco Mint, an Increase of
nearly $2,000,000 over the deposits of 1897
The largest proportion of this gold came
from California mines, as Selbys receive
probably three-fourths of the California
product at the same price paid at the
Mint and then refine it. Its books en
able a segregation of the amount of
California gold and so help the Mint
statistician in arriving at the figures of
the total California production yearly.
The rest of Selby's gold deposits come
from the Klondike. Alaska, British Co
lumbia, Mexico and farther south.
Many copper claims and partly devel
oped copper mines are being bonded or
sold along the copper belts from Plumas
south to Medera and Fresno counties, and
prospecting for copper is very active as
a consequence of the copper boom and
the. ready market for such properties.
One of the latest to be sold is the Cross
mine in Madera county, which has been
bought by New York men for $125,000.
This mine has been worked in a small way
for years. The Campo Seco mines in
Calaveras county are among those in
which active work is being resumed.
The Loyal Lead mine Of Black Hills,
Amador County, which has not been
worked for several years. is another of
the many old and long idle mines to be
reopened and developed. A San Fran
cisco company has secured an interest
and deposited $150,000 for development
work which will begin at once. It is
â 1 promising property, though the deepest
shaft is but 100 feet.

says the Amador Record. The shaft is
being sunk, the forty-stamp mill is ope
rating steadily, the foundation for the
new mill is being put in, and the road
down the canyon is being graded by hy
draulic process.
Grading has been done and foundation
is being put in for sixty stamps, but
forty only arc to be installed immediately,
bringing the mill capacity up to eighty
stamps, with an opportunity of adding
twenty more at a slight expense. The
new mill is on a line with the old one and
north of it.
The resumption of work at the Darling
mine, situated on Bear creek, near
Georgetown, is about the best piece of
mining news it is our pleasure to an
nounce this week, says the Mountain
Democrat of Placerville, El Dorado
County. An English company of means
has taken hold of the property and work
of unwatering the lower levels was com
menced the past week. John Wood is
putting the twenty-stamp mill in shape
to commence crushing within the next
two weeks. _
Tuolumne County was organized as a
mining district on April 29. at a conven
tion held in Sonora. The principal fea-
ture> of the laws adopted- was the follow
ing regarding mining locations:

Attorney Reuben H. Lloyd is arranging
to begin the systematic development of
his Golden West quartz mine in the Blue
Canyon mining district of Placer County.
This great property comprises 320 acres of
land and a water right covering inon
inches of water, which will be flumed KM)
feet l'i'nrn c dam and used at a pressure
of 32 feet. The ledge, is an immense one,
nearly 200 feet wide, and many assays
show values of from $5 to $100 a ton. It
is such large bodies of low grade ore i
which, if they yield a small average profit,
make the great mines.
The Azalea of Placer County is one of,
the Important drift mines' now being de
veloped with bright future prospects. It
is owned by the Blue Canyon Mining and
Development Company. The -in. Dun shares
of stock are mainly held by 136 railroad i

Axel Orling, a Swede, has invented a
rkabl
remarkable contrivance for steering a
torpedo from shore or ship without any
material connection between it and . the
operator. He gave a private demonstra
tion of the workings of his invention in
London last month. In one room Mr.
Orling had fixed up a model torpedo fitted
with a rudder like a fish's tail, while his
controlling apparatus was in an adjoin
ing- chamber; and though there were a
couple of partition walls between the two
objects the spectators were surprised to
see the rudder of the torpedo turning to
starboard or port at the will of the opera
tor. The principle of this invention con
sists in the transmission of motor force
by means of waves of light. Similar to the
X rays. The steering influence is opera
tive over a frontage of about 100 yards in
a distance of two miles, and the greater
the distance the longer becomes the line
of controlling front. The inventor will
shortly give a public demonstration of
the value of his invention for steering
purposes at the mouth of the Thames, rf
An invention of dubious practical value
was recently presented and explained be
fore the Society of Engineers'- meeting
at St. Petersburg. It is a con
trivance to automatically reveal a
leak on board ship, and consists of a cage
located in the hold, the cage containing a
lever with counterbalancing weight. The
presence of water disturbs the balance
and brings the lever in contact with an
electric system which then lights a lamp
in that part of the ship where the leak is
and rings a bell. The Russian Admiralty
has ordered two of th.oe "leak revealers"
to be placed on board the General Aprak
sin for experimental purposes. Some
twenty-five years ago an invention In the
line of automatic work was unloaded on
our Navy Department. It was an auto
matic alarm pump and ventilator! one
placed on each Fide or the shin and the
rolling motion of the vessel was to fur
nish the power to the contrivance for
ventilating or pumping purposes. It
failed to work in practice, but several sets
out of forty-seven purchased were, sent to
Mare Island with an order to place them
aboard ship. The order was obeyed
to this extent that the boxes containing
the pumping mechanism were put on
board some of the ships. The Saranac
carried her automatic alarm ventilating
and pumping contrivance carefully packed
away in boxes and stowed in the coal
bunkers, and when the old ship struck a
rock in Puget Sound the $4000 invention
went down with the ship. It might be â¢
said that there was no fair test, but as a *
matter of fact the inventor succeeded only
with the Government and was unable to
get it aboard any merchant ship.

with gratifying results. I had been
married four years aad had two chil-
dren. I was all run down, had falling
of womb with all its distressing symp-
toms. I had doctored with a good
physician, but I derived very little good
from his treatment. After taking a
few bottles of your medicine, I was
able to do my work and nurse my seven-
months'-old babe. I recommend your
medicine to every wife and mother.
Had I time, I could write much more
in its praise. I bid you God's speed in
your good work." â Mrs. L. A. Morris,

" DBAS Mrs. Pixkiiam â When I com-
menced the use of your remedies I was
very bad oft:. Every two weeks I was
troubled with flowing spells which made
me very weak. I had two of the best
doctors, but they did not seem to help
me.
"They said my trouble was caused
from weakness and was nothing to
worry about. I felt tired all the time; had
no ambition. I was growing vorse all

the outcome will probably be the arrest
of Captain Finch, master of the ship,
and Captain Ersklne: the pilot, for dis
obeying the orders of the State Quaran
tine Officer. Once before Dr. Chalmers
aaa Captains Finch and Ersklne arrested
ror docking the Gaelic without permis
sion, but as the steamer had been grant
ed pratique by the Federal Quarantine
Officer the two skippers were exonerated
by the State courts.
When the Gaelic arrived from the Ori
ent last Saturday afternoon Dr. Chal
mers, the State Quarantine Officer,
boarded her off Black Point. He at once
notified the captain and pilot not to cross
the quarantine line until he had exam
ined the ship's papers and the passen
gers. Dr. Brooks, the Federal Quaran
tine Officer, was nowhere in evidence,
and Finch and Ersklne, ignoring the
State officer proceeded on up the bay in
search of him. Tills made Dr. Chalmers
angry, and he made the mistake of go
ing on the bridge to call Captain Finch's
attention to the law of the case. By this
time the Gaelic was almost to the Angel
Island quarantine station and both cap
tain and pilot refused to discuss the ques
tion until the vessel was anchored. As
Boon as thai was accomplished Dr.
Brooks came aboard and then everybody
on the Gaelic Ignored Dr. Chalmers. The
latter was furious and left the steamer
and vowed that he would prevent the
passengers from landing. However, he
did not make the attempt, but Captains
Finch ami Ersklne are expecting arrest
to-day for Ignoring the State quarantine
laws. On this occasion they will not be
able u> plead that the ship had been
given pratique by the Federal Quarantine
t Ifflcer.
No time was lost in unloading the
Gaelic The work of discharging her be
i pan at 7 o'clock Saturday night, and by
yesterday morning over 22.000 package's

| used for receiving freight, and all day
long and all last night the work of load-

Sir James Poole, one of the passengers

ih<-r.- were two narrow escapes from
drowning on the front early yesterday
morning Ben Nixon, a fireman on the
steamer Willamette, was the first to near
ly loose the number of his mess. The col
lier is lying at the Beal< street bunkers
and Ben was making his way from the
Mail dock to her. He took a short cut
over the dilapidated wharves on the city's
property between Main and Beale streets,
and one of the planks broke under him
and he dropped Into the soft mud and
water underneath. The tide was coming
in and as Nixon could not extricate him
self from the tenacious mud, it looked as
though he was going to be drowned.
Luckily, when the water had reached his
armpits, a longshoreman heard his cries
and going to his assistance Boon had him
on the wharf again, Nixon was taken to
the Harbor Hospital more dead than
alive, where Dr. Digging treated him for
a scalp wound and Immersion. He will
be able to go back to his work to-day.
Henry Webb, chief cook of the bark
Alaska, was the other victim. The vessel
is lying at Howard street wharf and
when trying to go aboard Webb lost his
footing on the gangway and fell between
the ship and the wharf. The watchman
at Rosenfeld's bunkers heard him calling
for help and going to his assistance pulled
him out of the water. Webb was pumped
out at the Harbor Hospital by Dr. Dig
gins. He is now all right* again. Webb Is
an ex-British soldier and holds the good
service medal for his work in India and
Egypt. He saw plenty of active service,
as Dr. Diggins found. scars of half a dozen
bullet and-. sword wounds on his person
when he was treating him for submersion.
The bark Alaska will probably get away
for Cape Prince of Wales. Point Hope,
Kotzebue Sound and Cape Nome to-day.
Among her passengers will be a represen
tative of the Alaska Coal Oil Company,
who is going to locate oil wells at Point
Hope. These wells have been running
for years and in the hold of the Alaska
are 400 barrels that are to be filled with
the crude petroleum and brought to San
Francisco as a 'sample of the stuff. As
soon as the wells are located a house will
be built and provisioned and one of the
party who goes north on the Alaska will
remain there until next season. If every
thing is favorable a plant will be taken
up next year and the shipment of oil to
San Francisco in large quantities will be

SLOOP NIXIE PROVES HERSELF
A FAST SAILER.
A Novel Method of Awarding Time
Allowance Which Rendered Yes
terday's Trial of Speed
Interesting.
Visitors who went over to Sausalito
yesterday even by the earliest ferry boats
must have wondered what in the world
had become of the fleet of yachts general
ly to be Been at anchor In front of the
San Francisco Club house. Only three
boats remainedâ Dr. A. \V. McKenzTe's
-sloop Sappho, G..T. S. White's sloop Will
o' the WISQ and W. M. Edgell's little yawl
Dulce. All the othrr craft had sailed up
to Y;Ulejo on Saturday afternoon or even
ing and anchored in the channel well
above the ferry slip, in readiness for the
trial of speed held yesterday. The event
was 'inducted on a plan which is novel
in the Bay of San Francisco, and which
certainly proved very interesting. Hith
erto in regattas or races the yachts have
crossed the starting line as soon as pos
sible after the firing of the signal gun
for their class, and as they neared the
finishing point it was quite impossible
for the spectators to tell which boat had
' realty won. Bven the judges and official?
' did not know the result until elaborate
1 calculations of time allowances, starting
time and finishing time had been made.
In yesterday's race the time allowances
were calculated and were given to the
various boats before . they startedâ the
smallest boat started first, then the next
Smallest and so on, until the largest boat
in the fleet was reached, which crossed
the starting line last. Great interest was
felt in the event, because It brought out
the four big schooners Lurline. Aggie,
! Chlspa and Ramona, and also because tin.
sloop Nixie, which has never competed
in any races on the bay, though she has
th*- reputation of being very fast, was en
] tered.
At about 3 o'clock a sloop was seen com
ing through Raccoon Straits ahead of the
llet t. She was soon seen to be G. E. Bil
lings' sloop Nixie, which presented a
pretty sight as she crossed the finishing
line between the clubhouse and a stake
boat at 2S minutes and 34 seconds past 3
o'clock. Her corrected time for the dis
tance, which was estimated at 21.. r >o nauti
cal miles, was 3 hours 39 minutes and 42
seconds.
After the Nixie came the big schooners
I,urline. Aggie and Ramnna, the first
named being clearly distinguishable by
her black hull. The three were strung out
In line, and were separated by moderate
distances. Ramona was last of the three,
but as between Aggie and iAirllne, it was
anybody's race. 'Aggie was to windward
of" the other two, and so had the ad
vantage All three were standing off to
ward Yellow Bluff, before pulling out
and reaching for the stake-boat. Ramona
went about lirst. but the flood tide, which
was running strongly, set her up the bay
so much that she could not pass to wlnd-

ward of the mark, and had to go about |
again. This left the race to the Lurline !
and Aggie. The last-named went wen j
out before pulling about, and crossed the
line at 55 minutes and 18 seconds past 3 |
o'clock. Lurline followed 2 minutes and
5 seconds later. On corrected time Aggie,
which received 2 minutes and 3tt seconds
from Lurllne, won by the narrow margin
of 1 minute and 13 seconds. Ramona
crossed the line 15 minutes and 30 seconds
after Lurline. Nixie won the pennant for
the yacht crossing the finishing line first,
and Aggie received the pennant for the
boat making the fastest time down from
Vallejo.
The first of the small boats to finish was
A. Sutherland's Catherine, which was â Â«.
lowed by Commodore T. L. Hill's Cygnus,
E. C. Bartlett's yawl Frolic, Wood's sloop
Angela. J. R. Savory's sloo-> Juanlta. and
R. S. Bridgeman's Thetis, In the order in
which they are named. The schooners
Virginia and White Wings, the yawl
Ripple, and the sloops Aeolus. Will O'
the Wisp and Sappho did not start. The
schooner La Paloma, the yawl Phyllis,
the cutter Folly and the catboat We're
Here were distanced. The results are
shown In full in the table.
W. M. Edgell and J. Kitterman officiated
as judges; Commodore C. H. Harrison
was referee; Dr. V. P. Buckley acted as
timer at Vallejo, and R. R. l'Hommedieu
as timer at the club house in Sausallto.
The results of yesterday's race leave the
question of supremacy between the Aggie
and Lurllne unsettled, and show that no
boat In the bay can give the Nixie the
time allowance to which the rules entitle j
hÂ«r and beat her. It is likely that later
in the season the big schooners will meet i
again in a trial of speed.

Harry McNelll, a switchman, aeed 22
years, while assisting In making up a
train of cars at Townsend and Sixth
streets at 6 o'clock yesterday morning,
missed his footing while trying to board
a moving engine after he had succeeded
in in;iking his coupling good. The unfor
tunate young fellow was drawn under the
engine and had both his legs literally
ground off just below the knee joints
His cry of nain and suffering' was
heard by his fellow workmen, who ha?t
ened to his assistance, and as soon as a
conveyance could be procured had him
taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where
Dr. Henry amputated both legs. Up to a
late hour last nlKht MoNeill was still un
conscious, hut considering his youth and
strong constitution there is hope of his
life being saved.

EVEN BREAK
IN TWO HOT
BALL GAMES
iVlorning Contest Goes ;
to Harris.
OAKLAND'S TURN IS LATER
BOTH SHOULD HAVE ENDED IN
A TIE.
Two of the Dudes Put on the Hospital !
List During the Afternoon. !
Santa Cruz Again in
Second Place.
San Francisco and Oakland broke even i
In the two games played ester day, the I
locals turing the morning exhibition
at Golden Gate after ten Inning of 'â 
nrrve-sliiUtfring baseball, and the Dudes
taking the afternoon contest, as pretty an
Illustration of the great American game
as could bo asked for.
The morning game was a battle royal, j
in which Dunleavy was the central figure. 1
First he was responsible for San Fran- i
cifros' runs in the second, whereby the '
Ecore was tied up. Then in the third, j
with one man on the paths, he lifted the â 
ball over left-field nee for two runs. '
After that he sank into comparative ob- |
llvion until the tenth inning, when an- i
other bungle on his part gave Hank's j
mi n their winning run.
Another feature was the explosion of
Dr. .: iskiman. The medico went in to j
pitch, but was batted out of the box in ;
the third inning. Captain Lange being j
compelled to substitute Shea. The young- I
Fter showed remarkable nerve, holding j
;ht> sluggers down to four hits. Twice he j
cut them off after the bases were filled i
up.
Fireman Fitz received about as lively a
cannonading as he had been subjected to i
this reason, but only In the second did
the Dudes bunch on him. In that inning :
Oakland found him for a quartet, |
which, with some errors, netted as many â¢
runs. Frisco came right back at Moskl
man and evened up the score, which was ;
untied again for a few minutes in the
third; Oakland making its last two tal- !
lie?. San Francisco again tied it up in j :
their half and bid fair to win the game â¢
right there, but Moskiman was relieved, i
Matters ran along in that condition until !
the â  nth inning, and had it not been for j
Dunleavy's misplay the game would have i
ended in a knot, for there was not time to !
play another inning and fill their engage- j
ment on this side of the bay.
The afternoon game, while not as thrill- j
ing as that of a week ago, was more scien
tific by far. It was an ideal day for base
ball, the first really good day since the
opening of the season, which was testi
fied to by the presence of the largest
crowd that has passed through Recrea
tion Park gates this year.
Moekiman again went into the sty for
the Dudes, and notwithstanding his awful
treatment in the morning held the locals 1
down to five hits. Iberg was equally ef- â 
i live, and had a shade the better of the
argument in other respects, for he only j
gave one base on balls, to three for the j
doctor, and he struck out one opponent, j
while Moskiman did nothing in that line.
The game resulted in again placing
Ewings team in a bad way, for in the
fifth Hammond stopped a foul tip with
the end of his finger and lost a finger nail
by so doing. Dunleavy caught the string
out, Shea taking his place in left field. |
In the eighth inning Johnson stopped one
of Fitz's swift inshoots with his head.
He was knocked senseless for a time and '
was unable to finish the game. Hardie go- I
ing to first and Russell covering right !
pasture. That put two pitchers in the
outfield, but still Oakland managed to i
win.
It looked for a loner time like a shut-out |
for the locals. Oakland scored two in the i
third, when one was all it should have
had. Dunleavy sent one to Krug, who
fumbled, allowing him to reach first. A
balk under the new rules, being the first â 
time they have been enforced her. ad- j
vanced him to second, and he scored on
Hardie'a double to left. Muller made a
bad throw in and Lou kept on to third |
scoring on Mosklman'a single. That was !
the extent of Oakland's run-getting, and i
had it not been for Krug's error the score
would have been a tie at the end of the I
ninth. With the kind of ball both teams !
were playing there is no telling what the '<
outcome would have been.
Frisco's lone- tally came in the seventh.
"With one out Sullivan lifted out a double <
to right field fence and scored on Hilder- i
brandt's single. Next week Santa Cruz. !
which is now in second place, will come :
up here to fight it out with Hank's heavy
weights for first position. Call out the '
police!
The scores of both games are as fol
lows:

Santa Cruz Wins Aerain.
SANTA CRUZ. May Santa Cruz and
San Jose played gilt-edged ball this after
noon In the presence of a large crowd.
Santa Cruz pulled a victory out of seem
ing defeat by heavy slugging. At the
end of the .second' inning the score was 5
to 1 in favor of San Jose. The Garden City
team made four. runs through wild throws
to First Baseman Clark. Andrews pitched
.i steady game until Santa Cruz landed
on him in the sixth inning, when the
score was tied. In the following inning
San Jose made one. In the eighth Balsz
started the ball rolling by making a home
run, and bringing in a man. Donlin fol
lowed by hitting the ball over the fence,
bringing another man home.
In the first inning Santa Cruz substi
tuted Pace in center field for Cameron.
The substitution caused the tide to turn
in favor of the home team, for Pace
batted heavily. He threw the ball from
center to home, putting out a man at the
plate. Umpire Cahill again gave the ut
most satisfaction. Score:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 22. 1899.
HER VISIT RECALLS
A RECENT ROMANCE
.Mrs. J. F. Dwyep, Formerly .Mac Webber.
MIPS MAE WEBBER that wap. Mrs. J. F. Dwjer that Is, the hanflpnmo
young Ban Francisco urirl whose romantic marriage to the wealthy
young turfman in Milwaukee last February, after a brief courtship in this
city, is still fresh in the minds of newspaper readers, has been spending a
few days visiting hc-r mothfr. and yesterday departed (or the East accom
panied by her younger sister. Mrs. Dwyer arrived In San Francisco last Monday
and after dazzlinp her friends with tiii- beauty of her gowns and the brilliancy
of her uiamonds. suddenly announced that she must hurry bac- tn New York to
meet her husband, who is >n r.uite to tiiis country from England, and off she
went. Bfforc her departure, however, Mrs. Dwyer confided to several of her in
timate friends that she was supremely happy and had never experienced an
hour's regret for her action in marrying a man she scarcely knew. Sh<- also took
occasion w refute the reports of Dwyer losing fabulous sums on English race
tracks.
"I came clt\ir across the continent for the solo purpose of seeing my moth
er,"' said she just before stir left for New York, "and now I am going back to re
join my husband, taking my sister with me. Yon must not believe all you hear
about Mr. Dwyer . .-.ne- so much money on horses in England. He has not lost
enough to cripple him." and she smiled at the absurdity of thr> idea.
The drive was largo, the finest rigs in the
city being out for the pedestrians to envy.
' while cyclists by the score whirled to and
from I he beach.
Eariy In the afternoon a young
man who gave the Dame of Alfred
1... Norman concluded to take a stroll
'along the cycle path. An officer Informed
' him that the path was for the exclusive
us.- of cyclists, bui Norman Insisted that
: as the park was a public place be had a
right to w;Uk wh< re he pleased. The of
-1 ficer argued with him for a short time,
' and then Norman .bombarded the blue
coat with all the choice language at his
command. For this offensi Norman was
taken into custody, but Captain Thomp
son decided not to charge him with using
vulgar language, but instead to make- a
test case of his regarding the validity of
< the park ordinance prohibiting pedestri
ans from using the cycle path. In conse
quence Norman must appear and stand
trifi) for this offenfle,
Emll Markeberg, the sensational bal
loonist, rrail'- another ascension at the
j Chutes in the afternoon. His balloon rose
: about half a milo and the daring aero
i n:uit cut loose his parachute, descending '
without accident. The new galloping !
horses have now been completi d, and yes
terday were the star attraction, while the

1871 until 1886 the sessions were held in
that city, but in !hat year there came
a desire on the part of the Elks to
roam, and by vote it was decided to
change the. meeting place. Since then
the Grand Lodge has met in Cincin
nati, Detroit, Pittsburp. Cleveland,
Louisville. Buffalo, Atlantic City,
Minneapolis. New Orleans, and this
year St. Louisâ mpetinp three times in
Cincinnati and twice in Detroit.
The membership is composed of men
who stand highest in the several pro
fessions and businesses in which they
are engaged, and on the rolls can be
found the names of many of the most
prominent people of the Union, in
cluding statesmen, Government and
State officials and professional men.
San Francisco Lodge had for its first
exalted ruler the late Thomas W.
Krone, who subsequently transferred
his membership to St. Louis Lodge and
was a member of it when he died.
LOTTIE M PUTS
OUT PETRONIUS
IN THE FINAL
Tame Coursing at the
Union Park.
BOHE WINS THE PUPPY STAKE
JUDGE'S DECISIONS CAUSE A
WAVE OF DISSATISFACTION.
Lawrence, Who Is Rated as a Stake
Winner, Cleverly Defeated by
Lowlanuer at Heavy
Odds.
Lottie M took the big money in the
open stake at Union Coursing Park yes
terday. She defeated Lowlander, who had
battled with heavy odds, through six
rounds of the stake and won her honors
easily. The pools sold in favor of Lottie
M at about two to one, but considerable
money was played on the other dog, it
having surprised the talent by putting out
several good hounds, Lawrence, Cande
laria, Luxor. Tod Sloan and Petronius,
several of which were in the favorite
class.
Had it not been for a wild slip the
course would have been short and wiih
out incident, but Lowlander had the ad
vantage of many yards start in the lead
up, and started a game which lasted for
a couple of minutes. When Lowlander
reached the hare, however, the bitch was
beside him and did nearly all the work
in a long: and grueling course.
There was little of an exciting nature in
the day's sport, except, perhaps, the in
dignation aroused at some of the decisions
given by Judge Bull. One in particular,
on the course between Victor Qut-cn and
Mercy May, was rewarded by bootfl of
derision from the spectators, and was
pronounced as an insult to the intelligence
of experienced leashmen.
Short-enders were in evidence, and bet
ting was good. As a rule- the courses
were short, but some of them interesting.
The crowd was large and much Interest
was manifested in the sport throughout
the day.

CALIFORNIA CLUB EXHIBITION.
An Interesting Programme Has Been
Arranged for This Afternoon
and Evening.
The exhibition of arts and crafts of the.
California Club, which was opened so
auspiciously in the art gallery of the Me
chanics' Pavilion Saturday, attracted a
large number of ladies and gentlemen
yesterday, who express! their pleasure
at the excellence and variety of the ex
hibits.
It has been arranged that the head of
each of the committees will have a day
set apart for receiving visitors and look
ing after the exhibition generally. To-day
Mrs. W. H. Mills, head of the committee
on architectural and illustrative draw
ings, will have charge, ana an interesting
programme has been arranged for the oc
casion. In the afternoon Miss Etta
O'Brien will render a contralto solo, ac
companied by Miss Julia Heffernan, and
Miss Van Pelt will give a piano solo. In
the evening Mrs. Marriner-Campbell has
arranged to provide solos by Mr. W. J.
Batchelder, Mrs. M. C. Olcese. Miss Isabel
Kerr and Miss Marie Patridge accom
panied by Mrs. W. J. Batchelder. 1 .ie
band of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum will
also be in attendance.
A MYSTERIOUS CIRCULAR.
Calls a Meeting Which Nobody Knows
Anything About.
A circular has been seni through the
mails to a number of prominent citizens
in the city to attend a mass meeting to
night at Metropolitan Temple. The cir
cular states that the "meeting is called
by a committee of fifty property owner?
for the purpose of ascertaining- the cause
of the financial degenerncy of our city and
if possible to determine some means by
which to prevent a further loss to the
property owners."
The following speakers are billed to ap
pear: Irving M. Scott, Hon. (Jeorge C.
Perkins and W. H. L. Barnes. None of
these gentlemen knew anything about the
meeting when asked about it last evening.
They had not been annroachfd on the
suuject and stated that they would not
be present.
The Knickerbocker Quartot If also billed
to appear and Mr. Larson, onÂ© of the
singers says that it was engaged by a
Mr. Hender; n , who also engaged the
hall Mr j-enderson could not be lo
cated last night and further information
"â¢The fact that some five hundred printed
names of prominent men are on the cir
cular and that they know nothing ol the
meeting except that they received a cir
cular through th^. mails, and the further
fact that the speakers scheduled to ap
pear have not been apprised of the rr.eet
ing throws an air of mystery around it
which will probably be unraveled to
night at Metropolitan Temple.
GAGE IS NOT SEEKING
ADVICE ON THIS POINT
APPARENT THE GOVERNOR HAS
OVERREACHED HIMSELF.
Not Likely to Fill the Vacancies He
Had Caused by Deposing Some
of Budd's Appointees.
Attorney-General Tirey I>. Ford yester
day denied the accuracy of the dispatch
from Sacramento stating that he had j
given an opinion to Governor Gage to the J
effect that certain appointments .made
sfnee the adjournment of the Legislature
were illegal. The dispatch referred to j
those appointments made by Ex-Governor ;
Budd and withdrawn by the present ex
ecutive during the recent session of the j
Legislature. It was held that the Legis- ;
lature being in session under the consti- \
tution the new appointments should have
been made at the time. Governor Gage,
however, failed to do so, but has since
made appointments to several of the po
sitions.
The Attorney-General said the question
of legality had never been discussed by j
the Governor and himself and conse- [
quently he had given no opinion on the
matter. In the case of General Dickinson,
he said he had -given an opinion that
Build's appointees held office until their j
successors were appointed, but that was i
as far as it went.
When asked squarely about the conten
tion of the dispatch that Gage's appoint
ments were illegal, Attorney-General Ford
refused to express an opinion, saying it
would be discourteous to the Governor to I
do so. .;
Governor Gage would neither affirm nor
deny in positive terms the receipt of any
advisory letter from Attorney-General !
Ford. "I made the appointments, didn't i
I?" he said; "so why should I receive a
written opinion from General Ford in
forming me of their illegality? It is ob
vious that I would not ask advice on
something that has received full consum-
mation."
It looks as though the Governor does
not want an opinion on the question. The ,
law is plain on the subject, and it is evi
dent Governor Gage has defeated his own ,
scheme of deposing. Budd's appointees by
failing to name their â¢ successors until
after the adjournment of the Legislature.

Kragness Lowers a Road Record.
Eddie Kxagneas, the crack Olympic r"ad
rider, lowered the record between Oakland
and San Jose yesterday. He reduced the
former record of two hours and five min
ute* fifteen minutes. He was aided In his
task by Messrs. Henderson and Jackson,
and Stanley and Smith, the leading tan
(l. m teams of thp flying "O." The former
paced Kragnetfa the first twenty
live miles, and did so well that they de
cided to continue through to San Jose,
and they succeeded in establishing a new
tandem record. Henderson and Jackson
reached the Garden City three minutes
behind their speedy elubmates. Kragness
is looked upon as being one of the best
road riders in the State.
ALL THE GOLD
WILL FLOW TO
SAN FRANCISCO
Seattle Bullion Turns
This Way.
VICTORY ENDS A LONG FIGHT
NORTHERN MILLIONS NO LONG
ER FOR PHILADELPHIA.
The Treasury Department Corrects a
Big Discrimination and Adds
Millions to San Fran
cisco's Receipts.
The great current of gold at the San
Francisco Mint has been Increased by
several million dollars yearly by the
action of the Treasury Department in
ordering the deposits at the new I'nited
States Assay Office ai Seattle to v>e
shipped to San Francisco hereafter In
stead of to Philadelphia, as has been done
since the establishment of that depository
of bullion a little ov sr a year ago.
This is the victorious result of a long
and hard fight In behalf of San Francisco
interests begun last fall by the California
delegation at the instance of Interests
here. When the office was opened th<?
Treasury Department directed the ship
ment of its bullion to the Philadelphia
Mint and it further directed that de
positors of bullion should be paid by
check on the Sub-Treasury at Chicago.
This latter feature was a clear and un
warranted discrimination against San
Francisco in favor of Seattle as was vigor
ously urged by members of the <"alifornia
delegation, especially Senator Perkins and
ressmen Loud and Maguire-. r.<v
ment by check on the Chicago Sub-
Treasury saved depositors and bankers
the banking exchange of $1.50 per ?l""0
v.-hen it was wish--! to transfer the gold
from the Pacific coasi to the East. De
positors hen- were paid by check on the
San Francisco Sub-Treasury. The Seattle
depository, equidistant with San Fran
cisco from the Bast, was thus given the
advantage of 51.50 per thousand with
which t<> divert deposits from San Fran
cisco. The total exchange advantage en
joyed by Seattle bankers amounted to
several thousand dollars on the $6,0
or so of bulli"!i deposited there. As
F. A. Wing and Seattle papers exploited
this advantage to lure depositors from the
north. It was thought by some of our
delegation that the whole arrangement
was the result in some measure of the
influence of Chicago banking and I
portation interests to which Secretary
Gage was naturally friendly.
The express rate "ii the gold was at that
time exactly the same f> Philadelphia and
to San Francisco, the Northern trans
continental express companies haying re
duced their rate to gel the busin<
was urged thai the Shu Francisco Mint
with its extensive coinage facilities was
the natural place t'> send Pacific coast
instead of to the Philadelphia
Mint, which has so much uncoined bul
lion piled in i;s vaults, and thai the Sub-
Treasury here was the natural place for
payment of depositors. The Government
i not do a bark ss In comr
petition with bankers. San Francisco
bankers send nearlj â  of coined
gold Bast annually. It' rhe gold was
wanted East the bankers were the >mes to
send it there.
It took long negotiations and much
correspondence to win the day. Rut the
Director of th< Mini lately directed that
beginning with May depositors
should be paid by check on the San Fran
cisco Sub-Treasury, and thai the bullion
received should go to the San Frai
Mint. One element of the victory was a
reduction in the bullion express rate by
Wells. Fargo & Co.
The greatly increased output of the
Klondike this season will augment the
receipts of the Seattle Assaj Office, as
many shippers of gold will find that de
pository more â¢convenient. The new ar
rangement will not tend to the
deposits there materially. It will merely
concentrate' nil the Pacific Id at
San Francisco and add a number of mil
lions to the coinage here.

irchblshop, vested In full canonicals,
was in the sanctuary with the R>-v. Father
d'Ryan, late co-editor of the Monitor,
and the Rev. Father Dempsey as di
of honor.
R.-v. Father Ramm delivered the ser
mon. He took up and very briefly re
ferred to the coming down "f the Holy
Ghost into the church as an organized
body. He said that the Holy Spirit was
like" the soul of a man. "It gives unity
and life to these members," said the
speaker. "The spirit, however, dwells
r."t when in the church as a whole. lmt
entered into the individuals that con
stitute the church."
He pointed out that the Holy Spirit was
the uncreated life of God, binding the
Father and the Son in the blessi d
trinity. Everything Wâ¬ do, he said, is in-
Bpired by Borne kind of love. It may be
love of wealth, love of ease, love of dis
play of power and love of sensual
pleasure, and when this power of love Is
strong and tense enough, everything does
homage to it. The actions of the saint
and the pinner are all inspired by love.
If the love be that of an object, holy and
perfect so, too, will the actions be.
After mass the Bishop gave the papal
benediction in solemn form. This con
cluded the morning services.
In the afternoon at 4 o'clock the sacra
ment of confirmation was administered
by the Archbishop to about ninety girls,
fifty boys and nearly thirty grown p^r
sor.s of hoth seqces. 3everal of them con
verta to the church. During the services
the children rendered "Come, Holy Ghost,
Creator Blessed." and also the Te Deum
in English, 'Holy God. We Praise Thy
Name. As the conclusion of the cere
monies they sang the benedlctfon.
All the boys were Invited by the Arch
bishop to stand up find repeat after him
the solemn pledge of the League of the
Cross, binding themselves until they are
ty-one years of age to abstain from
all Intoxicating liquors, to shun saloons,
and as far as their influence could extend
to discountenance drinking in saloons.
In the evening Rev. Father Dempsey
delivered the sermon.
"SHAME AND SIN
OF OUR CITY"
REV. FREDERICK C. LEE TALKS
OF MUNICIPAL EVILS.
Calls for Union of Pulpit, Press and
Police in the Work of Moral
Cleansing.
Rev. Frederick C. Lee of the California
Street M. E. Church delivered another
criticism on the Police Courts, slave deal
ers In Chinatown and all manner of vice
rampant in the city, in a prelude to his :
regular sermon last evening on "The
Shame and Sin of Our City." He Bald:
If the Judges of our Police Courts wish to
keep their robes- clean, and, like Caesar' -wife,
live above suspicion, let them be more than I
dummies and figure-heads in their court rooms. j
let them exercise the authority the people have
Clothed them with and refuse to be brow-beaten
or dictated to by the "percentage poker
pleader" on the one hand or "flimflammed" by
i he clerks of their courts on the other.
Now that we have the rascals on the run, let
us' keen the trail hot. Let the and Jury probe
this straw bail business to the bottom. Let no
eiillty man escape. Let us find out If these
â â¢â Dikes" and "spiders" can commit every
crime in the calendarâ from pickpocket to mur
derâ then bribe jurors, "square" officials,
hnndwink judges and give the law the laugh.
Let there be no let up in the Chinatown c?u
--..i,].-â¢!> on opium Joints, gambling; dens and slave i
rims Of all the accursed evils that dare show
their foul face in our fair city, of all the vile ;
villainies finding sustenance and support on I
American soil, none is more disgraceful and
damnable than this traffic in womanhood. It
is a tolerated infamy because it pays for Its
r.rlvllefres It Is a "whited sepulchre" before
which every Federal official should hang hig
head in shame, from the lowest officer In the
custom house to President McKlnley In thÂ»
White House. â¢ _ . ,

of lust. Shame again upon the property holders
Who rent their houses for Fuch purposes, willing
to live on the proceeds of prostitution. Their
name? ought to be read out from every pulpit
In San Francisco. Shame, thrice shame, upon
every officer of the city, commonwealth and
nation who can be bribed by the wages of s!n
and acce] t a sharp of the corruption hind
which comes from so corrupt and devilish a
source.
Crime is lone and reforms are short, as a
rule. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty
and freedom from the buzzards and jackals, the
parasites and ticks that feed and fatten on the
body politic. I^et the papers and the public
keep "cases" on these gambling cases. -The
"percentage poker pleader" Is . only "fiddling
for wind." He knows, and the Jailbirds that
he defends know, that the public soon get tired,
and a? a rule these raids and reforms are only
spasms of virtue. After a long sleep the sense
of public decency Is aroused, there is a great
sputter for a little while -somebody, perhaps
not as guilty as the ninety-nine who have gone
free, is made a scapegoat of, put in the pillory
nni then our virtue takes another seven years'
sleep.
\. man or woman who makes any claim to
decency will deny that vice In all its hideous
forms, such as we find here in our city, ought
not to be suppressed. But no man or woman
outside of a lunatic asylum should be misled
into the belief that vice can be suppressed by
passing laws. You cannot legislate a drunkard
Into living a sober life. You cannot make a
man honest or pure or a woman chaste and
virtuous by passing an ordinance. You cannot
clothe the Board of Supervisor* with the power
of the keys, that whosesoever sins they remit
they are remitted: and whosesoever sins they
retain they are retained.
Therefore, it is all Important that public opin
ion should be directed against these evils, not
by fits and starts, like a Sacramento-street ca
ble car. but by a constant, steady and uniform
process, which is elevating in tone and educa
tional in character. A process by which right
standards are raised and the public conscience
quickened.
I hope our San Francisco papers will become
confederate and stand together in th.. good
work and not, like our Judges, forget the com
mon foe and turn their guns upon each other.
I care not what the, motive may be that In
spires the press so long as it arrays itself on
thÂ« right sideâ that Is half the battle. There
Is a host of evil-doer* who stand more li fear
of the press than they do of the prison. While
snapping their fingers in the lace of police of fl
eers they cower and crawl away from the
frown of public opinion. Without ihe press to
advocate its cause, reform might Is well give
up the fight, for. like the bird with the broken
wing, it may "flutter" but never fly. I read
all the papers, morning and evening. Sunday
and Monday, and of all the colors of the jour
nalistic rainbow. And if we can in place of
scattering, hold the prismatic rays of the press
together, we stand a good chance of getting a
piercing beam of white light.
I believe that if the three P's, that trinity of
powerâ the police, the press and the pulpit
will work together We can do a better work
than Hercules did when he turned the rivers
Into the cattle pens and pig sties of Augeas,
King of Ells, In defense of justice and moral
ity and in the suppression of vice and crime,
we may become a threefold cord not easily
broken.
"Christ as a Detective."
Rev. W. E. Dugan delivered a sermon
last evening at the Stewart Memorial
U. P. Church on the topic. Jesus Christ
as a ! 'In part he said:
We have- in country a vast detective sys
tem for the discovers of wrongdoers. It is an
efficient system, and I have noted with what
marvelous effects they bring the wrongdoer
to Justice. But the greatest detective of the
ages was the man of GalUee. His eye sweeps
the ages for the sinner, and there Is no hiding
place so reserved, secret or dark that his
penetrating gaze cannot find. Men try to evade
Christ, but his Justice as well as his love finds
them out.
Have you noticed in the capes of Mrs. Botkln
and Du'rrant, how, when people were puzzled
as to their guilt or innocence, that Christ in the
providence of life discovered and brought to
light the little bits of evidence mixed up
among a busy world's active life? For years
corruption has been going on in the gambling
hells and dens of this city, and we- knew noth-
Ing of it, but Christ's all-searching eye saw it
and he moved our city press to expose these
awful things. We are suffering under financial
troupe. Everywhere the cry is depression. We
see that combines are crushing out our finan
cial life. To-morrow evening there will be a
meeting at Metropolitan Temple of the business
and financial men of this city to determine the
cause of the financial depression of our city for
the past ten years. There will be many theories
advanced. Opinions will be divided, and If a
i inclusion If reached it will probably be errone
ous. Jesus Christ, the detective, has ferreted
out the trouble. He discovered it 1990 years ago
when he said that a man's life consists not in
the abundance of goods. The trouble is the ever
lasting thirst for money and the determination
to get it honestly or dishonestly. Selfishness is
the root evilâ capital against labor and labor
against capital. We are writing . books and
compounding theories to find the remedy. Christ
found the remedy when he. paid love your, neigh
bor. The fruit refrigerator combine and the
fruit growers of California need love. What we
all need more than title deeds Is love.

"Joan of Arc" His Text.
Rev. Father T. Caraher delivered an in
teresting; address on the Maid of Orleans
last evening at St. Francis Church.
"Neither in sacred nor profane history
have 1 read of. a heroine that so closely
resembles Judith or that so richly de-
Berves our praises as the saintly and re
nowned Joan of Arc. When the French
peopip were in the throes of despair and
the flower of their army was shut up by
the English in the City of Orleans, she
came to their assistance, ("lad in the ar
mor of ;i knight, seated upon a white
Bteed, bearing a sacred banner in her
right hand and leading a small army, shÂ«
Bet out for Orleans. Behold her cut her
way through the British, lines, enter the
city in triumph and bring provisions and
reinforcements to the famished and de
spairing garrison."
The speaker then outlined Joan of Arc's
progress, her arrest and execution, ,Jlp
said the execution of the heavenly hcro
in^ was a shame and a disgrace to f'hri.s
tianiiy. "Her treatment," he continued.
"stamped England as tho most inhuman
of nations and the most cruel of tyrants.
May God prevent the slightest alliance be
tween this fair repuhlic and that odious
monster Bngland that is drunk with hu
man blood.
"Though innocent as the angels of
heaven of Jill crime charged to her Joan
was sentenced by her Infamous judge to
bo burned at the stake upon the HOth of
May. 1481, and her body reduced to ashes
in the market place of Rouen. And now
let me exhort you to nasten by your
prayers and communions the beatification
and immunization of the Maid of Orleans,
so that we may he able to appeal to her
for assistance for ourselves and our be
loved country. Beseech Ood to soon place
her name on the calendar of saints so
that we may ask her to increase the valor
of our suns and guard the virtues of our
daughters."
The members of the League of Sacred
Hearts received holy communion in the
morning toward the beatification of Joan
dt Arc.

BEATEN FOR
HAVING A MAN
THROWN IN JAIL
Charles Brohm Bru
tally Assaulted.
HIS TEETH KNOCKED OUT
ATTACKED BY A FRIEND OF THE
PRISONER.
The Victim Found in a Semi-Con
scious Condition in His Lodging
House on Howard
Street.
Charles Brohm, who conducts the Chi
cago lodging house at 812 Howard street,
is the victim of a brutal assault. Yester
day afternoon Brohm caused the arrest
of a young man named Edward Bartlett
for robbing him of a silver watch and
chair.. Brohm claimed that Bartlett had
stolen the watch while he was asleep in
his room.
Shortly after Bartlett had been locked
up In the City Prison Brohm was visited
by two young men, who asked him if ho
intended to prosecute the alleged thief.
Brohm replied that he did, whereupon
one of the men threatened to send him to
the Morgue it he appeared against Bart
lett. Thinking they were only joking, as
he expressed it, Brohm laughed at their
threats. Shortly after 7 o'clcok last even
ing one of the men again visited the lodg
ing house and asked for the proprietor.
He took a seat in the office, and as soon
as Brohm appeared the young man struck
him in the mouth, knocking uut thr<e
teeth. As be fell prostrate to the floor
his assailant kicked him in the face and
body.
The screams of the injured man attract
ed the attention of several of the lodgers,
and they ran to his assistance. The as
sailant, evidently fearing arrest, dashed
frnm the house and made his escape. As
it was thought that Brohm was fatally
injured the lodgers summoned Police Of
ficer Beacli. He found Bmhm lying in
his office in a semi-conscious condition.
The policeman quickly summoned the
ambulance and had the wounded man re
moved to the Receiving Hospital. After
being placed on the operating table he
soon regained consciousness. The surgeon
who attended him found that in addition
to losing three of his front teeth he re
ceived an abrasion over the right eye
and a deep wound in the head, presum
ably having been inflicted by the heel of
his assailant's hoot.
Brohm claims he recognized his assail
ant as a friend of Bartlett. who at one
time roomed in his house. Ho says he is
known as "Billy" Burns, and that he has
beÂ» n arrested on several occasions for
various Indiscretions.
The police have a gnod description of
Brnhm's assailant, and every effort is
tuinir made to apprehend him.
GREEK LETTER CHAPTERS.
Dr. Georg-e Cook Establishing Them
in Medical Colleges.
Pr. rjcnrge B. Conk of Concord, N. EL,
president of the Alpha Kappa Kappa
Fraternity, a national organization of un
dergraduates in medical colleges, Is at
the California. Dr. Cook came to this
coast on the invitation of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons to establish a
fraternity chapter in connection with the
institution. The branch was instituted
Friday night and will be known as Beta
Chapter. In discussing the subject last
evening Dr. Cook said:
"The home chapter of the fraternity Is
in Dartmouth College. There are five
others besides the one just organized in
this city. Those are at the University of
Vermont. Burlington; Tuft's Medical
School of Boston, Long Island College.
Brooklyn. N. V.: Boden Medical College,
Brunswick, Maine, and University of
Minnesota, Minneapolis.
"It is comparatively a new proposition
to have Greek letter chapters in medical
colleges, but it lias taken a firm hold and
baa come to stay. 1 will organize chap
!â  rs as fast as applications are made, and
expect to see a healthy growth of the
fraternity. The objets are fraternal ami
educational, and give the prospective
medico a chance to get posted by the
reading of medical papers and the discus
sion of pertinent topics which will later
help him in his profession."

The illzp:i!: benediction, 'The Lord be

ringing simultaneously from 4000 throats,
was a flttii f the Anal rally to
night of the Christian Endeavor conven

with them many fond recollections of the
past few days and u< w hopes :'ur the

The theme for to-night was "The Glory
rpi,:! Thee." Thee
usual excellent music was furnished by
the chorus of 4U" voices under the direc
tion of A. M. B( -..' am and Benjamin
Clark, and the preparatory service was
conducted by Rev. Mr. Kelley uf the
Lutheran Church of this city, followed by
music and offertory.
An address on "The Home, the Place
of Beginnings, was delivered by Rev. H.
K. Walker, D.D., who pointed out that
the beginning of ail great movements is
"The horn.-, said the speaker,
"is where Charles and John Wesley got
their inspiration. The Christian Endeavor
movement began not in Williston Church
n Williston Parsonage. There did
Dr. Clark talk it all over with his dear
wife." The importance of the home the
speaker gave as one reason why ail
should join In and help the work of the
Juniors and Intermediate Endeavorers.
The lack of chivalry in the family, in the
â >â¢ and In the : is given as
ngs of this nation.
After the installation of officers, during
which Rev. Francis E. dark officiated,
and another selection by the chorus, Rev.
Mr 'lark delivered a stirring address on
"Mori Fruit." He did not think it worth
while, he said, to speak against the dance
hall, card party and theater. "The ques
tion is too often asked," said he, "not in
the spirit of how much can 1 do for God.
but how far can I go the "'.her way?"
Mr. ciark congratulated the Endeavorers
an the excell< nt â¡ just concluded
and on the good outlook. He urged them
to go forward with new courage and
that statistics
that Christian Endeavorers are
as faithful as older people in church
attendant c. Rev. Clark's address was
followed with the closing consecration
Bervice, led by George !' Lowell, and the
concluding hymn, "We'll Never Say
lit odby in Heaven."

ind the newly-elected officers and
plans fur the coming year will be dis

This proved to be a "Day With God"
for the Christian Endeavorers. Beginning
at 8 o'clock this morning meetings were
held in various churches in this city. Ala
meda and Berkeley, and the theme dis
pon was "The Glory of the Lord
[a Risen upon Thee"â Matt. iv:2. In the

meeting. Rev. J. C. Mclnnes of tieulcia

This afternoon simultaneous rallies

meeting for men only, R. H. Chamberlain
presiding. Thia meetinng was held under
Ihe auspices of ti.e young Men's Chris
tian Association. Rev. Mr. Clark Bpoke
Interestingly a: jth on his trip
In Cuba, whence he returned recent
ly. He told how he had frequently wit
nessed the overindulgence In strong' drink
among some of the American soldiers â a
Bight to be lameiifd as one that went to
demonstrate that sometimes patriots for
got that they are soldiers and thereuy
ountry, at the -a me time
setting a vi ry had example r" >r others.
Mr. ('lark made an urg-ei:: and eloquent
plea to the young men to live true and
correct lives for the sake of their coun
try, for their own sakes, and for God's
take.
On hr-half of the Young Men's Christinn

A THRILLING ASCENSION.
A Burning Airship Almost Claims
Two Victims.
OAKLAND. May 21.- Several thousand
amusement seekers at Oakland Turk were
treated this afternoon to one of the most
remarkable balloon ascensions ever re
corded. The sight of a man hanging by
his t. es ascending Into space and suspend
ed fn.ni a burning ball. .on thrilled their
senses to an Indescribable awe, added to
which was also the narrow escape of an
other man who had clung to one of the
ropes attached to the balloon in the hope
of preventing the ascension, since it was
he who Brat dicovered the fact .hat the
balloon was Ã¼blaae.
Fred Vosmer, brother ot the weii
known aeronaut and a novice at the air
sailing business, went up in the balloon
this afternoon hanging by his toes. Just
a-< the gas Inflated globe began moving
upward and most of the helpers let go of
the ropes Dave, one of the men about the
balloon, still clinging to a rope, shouted
to Vosmer to drop because the balloon
was afire, Vosmer, however, answered
thai he cared not, and instantly the air
ship shot up into the <olr with the novice
a<= weli as Dave, who became entangled
in the rope he had lx?en holding fast
When about thirty feet from the ground
Dav< fought his way clear from the rope
and dropped. Those who stood with bated
breath expecting to see the man picked
un as dead wi re thunderstruck to see him
rise from the ground, stagier an instant
and walk off into tne crowd of spectators.
He reside? In Alameda and refused to
mnke known his last name.
In the meantime she burning balloon
ha.l ascended fully 700 feet, when it began
swaying and spilling, and In the nick of
time Vosmer cut loose his parachute and
made a descent that waa i as i graceful as , it
was relieving to those who feared nothing
less than his destruction.

THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 22, 1899.
COMMISSIONER FAWCETT
HAS A GOOD DEFENDER
H. Pinkiert Believes This Country's
Representative in the Klondike
Has Been Misjudged.
H. Pinkiert, a well known mining man
of Dawson, has been in the city for the
past two weeks. He speaks very highly
of the treatment accorded by the Gov
ernment In the Klondike regions and
; states that the charges of unfairness
| made against Gold Commissioner Fawcett
are false and prejudiced. Mr. Pinkiert
said that Mr. Fawcett had done every
thing In his power to accommodate the
people of his district.
"Despite the fact that Mr. Fawcett had
very poor quarters and very little assist
i mice," said Mr. Plnkiort, "he has done
more work and moro good than any man
ui> there. He works early and late, re
cording claims, settling disputes and pro
tecting the interests of every one. It is
not right for any one to attack a man who
has done his duty. There was no need of
an investigation as he is a man of honor.
In my opinion a man is entitled to pro
tection lrom his own Government, and
those who maliciously attack him ought
to be punished.
"There are now 30,000 people in the Yu
kon district. There is very little crime
committed there, and it has the reputa
tion of being the quietest camp in the
world. Jt is due to Captain Harper and
Captain Stern, who are in charge, of the
police. Governor Ogelsby is without a
! doubt the right man in the right place.
He has ability, and we are proud of him.
He is beloved by our citizens because he
fives all nationalities a fair hearing,
.ast winter there was sickness in camp
and the Government erected a hospital
and paid out a large sum for the treat
ment of those taken sick."
Mr. Pinkiert advises all flio.se who eon
| template going to the Klondike regions to
i go well provided. He said gold could not
Be found in the streets. Every one who
I goes there must make up his mind to
j work hard. He has completed arrange
! ments to have issues of The Call sent to
him, as he will act as agent for the pa
per The news furnished by Sam \vall.
The Call's correspondent, has made the
paper- popular with the residents of that
i far-off region. Copies sell at 50 cents
each. Mr. Pinkiert will leave to-morrow
night for his new home. He will take a
large number of Calls and hopes to have
them in Dawson early in June. Mr. Pin
kiert way well known in this city as the
proprietor of the blpr bazaar of ..iat name.

of time will not allow him to visit all.
Still, ho will "sidetrack" as often as pos
sible.

The victim in this case was .the six
Â»ld son of Thomas Kearney, a
well-known salesman of the firm of \V.
J. Si . of >>i\ Market street
The tragedy occurred -on Thin? streel
between St< venson and Jessie. The
f;uher and son were on opposite sides
of th" street and the child started V,
- over to his parent. At the samp
ar No. mi was coming up Third
streel I speed and the boy svaa
struck and thrown down by the deadly
vehicle. Spectators say that no warn
ing bell was sounded and that th"
headway of the car was not stopped.
Here is where the economical fender
of th. Market street Railway Com
pany showed its real merits. The boy
was thrown down in front of the fen
and Instead of being picked up
mul carried safely until the car step
ped, as is done by proper fenders, he
was rolled under the wheds, dragged
over the paving stones and ground un
der the car for nearly half a block.
When th'- motorman succeeded in
stopping the car the unfortunate child
was ;t crushed and bleeding human
wr< i k.
If Messrs. Huntlngton and Vining
had stood on Third street at the time
and had had under consideration the
advisability of adopting a fender that
would prevent the continual destruc
tion of life by their car.s; had they
seen the helpless victim dragged to his
doom; heard bis shrieks ol agony as
he was ground to death; had they
heard the awful cries of the father as
he saw his only offspring drawn Into
the death-dealing mechanism of the
trolley; had they seen him rush t<j the
Bide of the car begging the motorman
to stop, and then. In his frenzy, clutch
the ham! rail and endeavor tv stay the
Slaughter of his childâ they might
have concluded that their heartless
penuriousness, with its long and ever
growing mortality list, was not the
kind Of economy honest men would
pursue.
Furthermore, their ideas regarding
the sentiments of the public with refer
ence to the policy of the company would
have been broadened to their own ail
vantage, for it was only by reason of
the presence of several policemen that
the gripman, William Tanner, was not
mobbed. When the car was anally
stopped and many willing hands had
lifted it so thai the victim could i>" re
leased from the grip of the wheels, the
motorman attempted to proceed on his
way unconcerned. Then the desperate
parent sprang upon the dummy bent
upon vengeance.
He was followed by many Incensed
bystanders and cries went up from the
assembled crowd, which then numbered
hundreds, "Mob him," "lynch him." and
for a few moments it looked as though
another tragedy would be credited to
the railway company. The vigorous
efforts Of the police prevented violence,
but the crowd was in an ugly mood.
They hooted and jeered the police and
cursed the frightened man who had
driven his car over the hapless boy.
What might have happened had some
responsible official of the company ap
peared al that time must be left to the
imagination.
The shapeless and bloody body at the
child was carried Into the Grant drue
store, "ii the corner of Stevenson and
Third streets, but nothing could be done
for him, ;nid in duo time the boy was
â  to the Receiving Hospital In an
ilance. He died aboul an, hour
later.
.h.st before he passed away he recoj?
nizi d the father, who was standing over
him. Slightly raising his head from the
pillow of the cot, he asked his grief-
Btricken parent to kiss him.
"I'm going, papa," he feebly remarked
as he imprinted a kiss on his father's
forehead. "May God bless you." The
injured boy then sank back into his cot
and died a few minutes later. Over
come by griff, the heart-broken parent
staggered out of the Receiving Hospital
and was about to collapse when seized
l>y two of the attendants. He was thpn
induced to visit the Southern Station,
where he tearfully told the story of the
accident to Captain Spillane.
A few minutes later William Tanner,
the motorman, walked in accompanied
l iy twu policemen, who had him under
arrest.
"It could not be helped," lugubriously
remarked the motorman. "The car was
proceeding along Third street at the
usual rate vf speed when the unfortu- |
nate boy ran in front of it. I auickly I
ODDlled the brake and reversed the cur
rent, but too late to save his life. I
beard the cries of the excited crowd to
l> nch me, but paid no attention to them
as 1 was anxious to know whether or
not the boy was fatally injured."
Tanner was allowed to take his car to
Twenty -ninth and Mission streets,
where a substitute was placed in
charge. He was then escorted to the
City Hall.
After listening to his story. Captain
S;.illane ordered Tanner locked up on
a charge of manslaughter. At a late
hour last night he was released on his
own recognizance â¢by Police Judge
Graham.
Spectatpra do not agree with the
statement of Tanner, but declare on an
upgrade, running at the regular speed,
there was no excuse fur the car being
run for nearly a half block, particularly
when a human being was being ground
to death. The telltale blood marks on
the track and cobblestones fully estab
lish their statements. Ono of the eye
witnesses, John Garvey, living at 158
New Montgomery street, gaid:
"I was standing on Third street, be
tween Jessie and Stevenson, when the
boy started to cross the street. The car
was going at a good speed. There was
no bell sounded, and the boy was
knocked down. The fender, instead of
catching the child, rolled him under
the wheels, and the car kept on its
way. I and several others yelled to the
motorman to stop, but for some rea
son he did not do so, and the poor lit
tle fellow was dragged about half a
block up the hill to the cc-rner of Ste
venson. On that grade hf should have
Btopped sooner, but that would not have I
saved the boy, for the fender and the !
wheels did their work at once."
"I saw the accident from the start,"
said Max Roberts of IT>2 Minna street.
"The fender did not help the child; on
the contrary, it teemed to lift him up
and permit him to go under the wheels.
It was awful to see him dragged such I
a distance and to hear his shrieks and i
those of the father. The car, I think.
could not have been stopped in time to I
save the child's life, but if the fender j
' had been worth a blank he could not
j have been seriously injured. It looked
i t>> me like murder, and at one time I
thought the crowd would lynch the
motorman.'
Other witnesses coincided with the
foregoing statements. However,

SLAVERY OF CHINESE GIRLS.
Rev. Charles E. Locke Discourses Elo
quently on the Subject.
Rev. Charles Edward Locke addressed
a large audience at Metropolitan Temple
last evening. His subject was "Back to
Jesus." The sermon contained an earnest
protest against the slavery of Chinese
girls in San Francisco._ In part he said:
There is a slave dealers' association in China
town engaged In the atrocious business of Im
porting Chinese girls. These girls -are 15 to 16
years of ace and are â  either kidnaped and
brought forcibly to this country, or they are
pawned by their parents, who have been driven
by dire poverty to dispose of their children to
secure food to eat. They are landed In this
country Illegally, and instead of finding good
husbands awaiting them, as they are often
promised by the demons who deceive them.
they are plunged Into a life of infamy and
shame compared with which death is infinitely
more preferable.
There is a suspicion thai even some white
men belong to this slave dealers' association:
These girls are bought and sold like chattels,
or cattle, dally In Chinatown, and it Is stated
that the sale Of children Is continually taking
place. There is a little child now in one of
the missions of this city who was sold for (150
v.-hen she was ten months old to pay' her fath
er's doctor bill. Many of these children and
girls who are thus sold were born in this city.
and hence we have the disgraceful anomaly of
allowing prospective citizens of the United
States to be sold into slaveryâ contrary to the
law and sentiment of the entire nation. It is
an outrage which loyal people cannot permit to
continue without shame and crime. They are
sold at from $1000 to $2200. They are often
most cruelly treated, have been known to have
been kicked to death by their bestial owners,
and. though they are known to die, yet I have
been told by Christian workers In Chinatown
that there are never any funerals among them
and never any death certificates.
It costs about $900 to land a girl In San Fran
cisco. it is positively asserted that the Chinese
cannot carry on the business in all of its de
tails without the aid of American lawyers.
watchmen, and others. Some of our debased
fellow citizens are thus engaged in this loath
some business, and because of the large sums
of money expended it Is declared that political
parties have beÂ»n. criminally Involved In this
evil, and at one time certain Custom-house
officers were known to be In league with the
highbinders' society.
We ought to be actively opposed to this crime
against these Oriental women out of sheer
selfishness, for it is reported that large num
bers of American boys and young men are
frequent visitors of these places of vice. We
may be sure if we do not denounce and de
stroy this evil It will react upon our homes and
upon our government.
There are more than a hundred disreputable
houses In Chinatown. It is almost impossljv.e
to rescue these girls. Several young Chinamen
have interested themselves in divulging the
methods of the slave* dealers, and the Importa
tion if these poor girls has been much reduced,
bill these young men have so much incensed
those whose business has been Injured that
offers as high as $2000, it Is said, have been
made for the heads of these brave young men,
and they may be assassinated at any moment.
Fellow citizens, are we not criminally
lethargic In permitting these frightful and
abominable Infractions of the law. The courts
and Police Department, backed by billows of
public sentiment, can greatly reduce and by
and by eradicate these infamous wrongs. In
the name of God let us call upon those In au
thority to do their whole duty.
The Circus a Success.

Tho cirrus in the "Barn" at Glen Park
which commenced yesterday, proved a blsr
success. The equestrian feats by the St

SCENES WHILE THE EAGLES RESTED AT SCHUETZEN PARK.
EAGLES FLEW
OVER THE BAY
TO SCHUETZEN
First Outing of the
Aerie.
BIRDp IN HOLIDAY PLUMAGE
FIVE THOUSAND JOINED THEM
AT THE PAKK.
Initial Picnic of the New Organiza
tion Was Successful Far Beyond
the Expectations of the
Originators.
) -â¦ -
â 
Who are the Eagles? Tommy Lindsay,
who ought to know, says "they are a
rational innovation on civilization." The
social register shows that they are only
six weeks old in San Francisco, nearly
six hundred .strong- and still a-growing.
The picnic they gave yesterday at Schuet
zen Park, neur San Rafael, stamps them
what, they areâ a.ktt of good fellows, who
know a good time when they see it.
More than five thousand others thought
the same thing and winged their way
across the bay with the newly fledged
flyers from the San Francisco aerie. Four
times the big steamer Ukiah made the
trip to Tiburon and four times ten car
loads of ' well-dressed humanity were
whirled over the rails to the pretty Ma
rin County resort, where the Eagles, who
had "early birded" the programme, had
everything set for the. later comers. And
what a brilliantly plumaged lot they were,
all so decked in the best feather that it
was difficult at first glance to tell the
girlie birdsâ they were birdsâ from
the Johnnie birds. Some of them, too, to
carry out the metaphor, cooed 'to their
hearts' content, but that was after Eagle
J. S. Cannon had generously provided for
the first prizes in the young ladies' race.
Uefore that came off, however,- and after
It, for that matter, the picknickers en
joyed themselves to their hearts'/content.
They lunched in the honeysuckled covered
bowers, they danced and danced in the
big pavilion and at least one stunning bru
nette, who said she was sorry she had
not worn her cerise waist instead of a
blue-striped affair, executed a Cakewalk
that brought down salvos of applause
There are a few people misguided
enough for awhile v to think that before
the outing ended some of the Eagles or
their friends would moult their coats and
mix things. It took no time at all to con
vince them that "there was nothing to it."
Never a more orderly crowd took part in
a picnic within a hundrÂ«d miles of the
city. It was well Broomed, good-looking
and well-intentioned. It partook of re
freshments as If it had been accustomed
to them and it joined in the casual amuse
ment providedâ from throwing baseballs
at the head of Aguinaldo, at three for ten,
to purchasing the most specious brand of
gold brick dispensed by Eagle "Sky" Os
terhout. Even Harry Brennan, who is
not used to such frivolity on Sansome
street, had to come out of his shell and :
get his tintype taken with, oh, such .1
stunner.
Only a few hundred took the morning
boats for the picnic grounds and had
dressed them nicely by the time the first
trainload of the afternoon landed. Then
the fun began for all but First Vice-Presi
dent E. L. Wagner, who had been induced
In a moment of thoughtlessness to don a
pair -of white duck trousers. For a while j
he was nearly tickled to death, so many '
fleas were attracted 10 his vicinity. By i
judicious sprawling on the grass, -the
ducks were converted Into mallards, and
he had peace for the remainder of the af
ternoon.
The races, for which valuable prizes had !
been donated, were run off during the
afternoon and furnished a large amount
of amusement. John Herget shot the
barrier and handled the recall (lag like
an old timer. The games committee, con
sisting of S. D. Simmons. J. Harris, J. P.
Gljnn. M. W. Brady, C. B. Corey and W. I
1... Dolan, was on the Judges' stand. The
events were pulled off without a bitch,
except in the fat men's race, where there
was a protest that Fred Butts was a pro
fessional. It was not allowed and Butts
flitted in, Charley Long, who was running
a close second, falling in a faint from the
exertion and losing second place to Myer
Cohen, the king of the dudes. Long was
brought to with cold applications by
Crowley. the iceman.
Around the pavilion where the commit
tee distributed the gate prizes, a crowd
was held spellbound for an hour, while
Colonel Kowalsky between naps, turned
the wheel, from which two little girls.
Katie Bannister and Reta Glynn, drew
the hundred lucky numbers. Over in the
bowling alley they bowled, and in the
shooting gallery they shot, and all around
everybody had a most enjoyable day, so
much bo that most of them were sorry
when the last train wasl ready to steam
away at 6:30 o'clock. , .

Boys' â Walter Wanten first, R. Duffy
second, Martin Krelini? third. â

YOUNG REPUBLICANS MEET.
Session of the Executive Committee
of the League.
The executive committee of the Young
Men's Republican League of San Fran
cisco Clubs met Saturday evening at the
league headquarters on O'Farrell and
Powell streets. Chairman Henry C.
Langrehr presiding, and Dr. Charles
H. Holsman acting in his official capacity
as secretary.
The main subject under discussion was
the part the League Clubs were to take
In the coming primaries. Mr. H. D.
Mitchell suggested that as the League
was particularly strong in some of the
Assembly Districts, he thought it advis
able to select from the organization the
names of several of its members as dele
gates to the convention. Mr. Mitchell's
suggestion met with the hearty approval
of every member of the committee, and
was finally adopted. Mr. B. T. Dudley, in
speaking of the league sending delegates
to the convention, said that the County
Committee would certainly recognize the
organization in this respect, as under the
new primary law the league could, if
necessary, put Its own ticket in the field.
Dr. H. A. Raymond moved that a com
mittee of two be appointed, consisting of
trank K. Spencer, the president of the
league, and Henry C. Langrehr, the
chairman of the executive committee,
with power to seteet and appoint three
delegates in each of the Assembly Dis
tricts; to complete the organization of
district clubs for the league. The mo
tion being seconded by E. D. Montrose it
was unanimously adopted.
A special circular has been ordered
printed and distributed among the mem
bers bf the league throughout the as
sembly Districts, giving them in detail
the precise meaning of the new primary
law, and also urging the attendance of the
members and their friends at the
primaries. The committee also voted 10
hold the annual high jinks of the league
on Saturday evening, September :Â», 1899,
by which time it is earnestly hoped that
the First California Volunteers will be
home, as the league has 116 members
now in Manila. A large number of appli
cations for membership were considered,
and out of the number several were re
jected. After other business was con
cluded the committee adjourned to meet
again on Thursday evening, May 25.
ABUSED DEWEY AND
WAS PROMPTLY BEATEN
BERMAH SPECK TAUGHT A LES-
SON IN PATRIOTISM.
John McGoomis Thrashes Him and
Sends Him to the Hospital for
Repairs and Is Himself
Arrested.
In future Bermah Speck will be more
careful before whom he belittles the
name and fame of Admiral Dewey. His
unpatriotic utterances, earned him a ter
rible beating at the hands of John Mc-
Goomis, a young American, â¢ whose ad
miration for the naval officer would not
permit himself to stand by while his hero
was assailed by a foreigner.
Speck had been brooding over the un
kind things said of Kaiser "Wilhelm by
Captain Coghlan of the Kaleigh and last
night the. pent-up feelings burst and he
launched a tirade of abuse on Dewey and
eventually he was sent to the hospital for
his temper. â  After imbibing in sundry
glasses of steam beer he staggered into
the saloon kept by Henry Herting at 115
Point Lionos avenue. Several men were
there and during their talk Admiral
Dewey' name arose and they discussed
the proposition to erect a monument in
Golden Gate Park in his honor and pre
senting a home to him by voluntary sub
scription. Speck's German blood revolted
at the idea, but, like an unwise man, he
gave vent to his feelings by ridiculing and
pooh-poohing the whole idea. He even so
far forgot himself as to abuse the ad
miral.
Mrs. Herting, the wife of the propri
etor of the resort, was behind the bar,
and as she is somewhat of a patriot her
self, it pained her to hear Speck's re
marks. She prayed that one of the men
would defend Dewey. but as no one would
take up his defense she burst out, "If my
son wore here you would not make those
statements." McGoomis happened to be
in the back part of the place, and when
he heard Mrs. Horting's- threat he in
quired into the matter with the result
I that he fell to and gave the unpatriotic
German a beating that be will remember
for many months. In fact Speck was in
such a bad condition when McGoomis fin
ished with him that he had to be sent to
the Receiving Hospital.
Officer Isaacs, although a patriot him
self, had to do 'his duty, so he placed Mc-
Goomis under arrest and charged him
with battery.
