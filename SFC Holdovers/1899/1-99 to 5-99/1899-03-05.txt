LONDON. March 4.â The week's I
closing is crowned with indica- j
tions that political events of dan- \
gerous magnitude are preparing.
The machinery is mostly out of '
Bight in the Foreign Office and in the :
undercurrent of popular passion, but ]
nevertheless it is real.
Tht-re is no news from South Africa. |
but a crisis is preparing for which the \
Transvaal is arming under instruc
tions of German officers. England is
quietly strengthening her garrfsons nn
the borders of Natal, and Delagoa Bay
will shortly become either Boer or
Jlritish, for th.- Portuguese have long
ago ceased to command respect at that
port, Th" best in Fouth Africa.
I have learned from good authority
that Russia has 10,000 men at Port
Arthur and 40,000 more In that general
neighborhood, whose principal busi
ness is to discourage others from buiid
ing railways in Northern China and
gradually to familiarize us with the

Russian Governor. The Muscovite pro
test against railway extension to New

Victoria's Yacht Will Be :
Convoyed by British
Torpedo-Boats.
Her Majesty Refuses to Forego Her
Annual Trip to the â 
Riviera.
Copyrighted, 1899, by t'n<Â» Associated Press.
LONDON, March â The arrange
ments for Queen Victoria's departure j
for the Riviera next Thursday have j
been completed. ' Her Majesty will j
travel to the south of France by way
of Boulogne-sur-Mer, instead of via !
Cherbourg, this being the first time she ',
will have visited Boulogne si-nee the
Crimean war.
Some interest is taken in the fact
thar the Queen's yacht will be cpnvoyed
by eight of the fastest torpedo-boat de- :
' p trovers in the British navy, five of
them being thirty-knot boats. Cruisers j
have previously been employed for this j
duty, and the use of destroyers, it Is!
hinted in some of the papers, is in
tended to set off the French papers'
talk about submarine torpedo-bc.-ats.
There is much indignation in England
:at the scandalous and coarse attacks j
.made upon Queen Victoria by some of
the newspapers of Paris this week. The
Libre Parole, In an insulting article, J
said:
Frankly, the Queen will be well advised |
if she does not come to France this
epring The constitutional fiction that *
it was f.or<l Salisbury and not the Queen
â who Inflicted the outrage of Fashoaa
.'and the humiliation of Muscat on France
will not sutflce. It is well known that the |
Queen has' directed England's policy |
throughout her long reign, and she has j
â never missed an opportunity of displaying
her antipathy for France. Under the cir- ,
eumstances, therefore, her visit is an ad- ;
â¢. tftional msult and a defiance of public
opinion. After this warning it will only
-be her own fault if she meets with a hos
tile reception in France.
M. Cassaignac's Autorile says:
' The Queen becomes our guest at a mo
ment when the British Government has
made Itself more than ever our enemj.
I>r journey will be full of the same risks
8* the Maine Incurred in entering Cuban
waters, and the French Government is
committing the same foolish act as Senor
flnrasta by not preventing France .J" '
ting ia c.l in such a position that the
smallest accident might precipitate both
-powers in a terrible conflict.
' After such insinuations as the fore
. ci.ing it seems possible that tne
Queen visit to France will not pass
without some Chauvinist incident. A
special police staff has left Paris to
watch over her Majesty at Cimiez,
where her heavy baggage is already ar
riving. Queen Victoria pays $12,000
monthly for her own rooms, without
counting the expense of her suite, num.
Bering sixty persons. Altogether her
"little trip will cost her about $<5,000.
Her chaise, favorite white donkey ana
' numbers of pet dogs and birds have i
be-en sent abroad. Her Majesty also ,
.'has a curious whim about sleeping in j
her own bed, which Is taken with her
wherever she goes. i
The San Francisco Call.
United States is concerned, for if his j
words are true we are compelled to
question the veracity of competent
eye-witnesses at Manila and else- j
where.
There are many forces making for >
war, and the Czar's proclamation
seems to have been the signal for re
doubled military energy.
England is conscious that she may
pnnn be called upon to fight against a
coalition of Russia and Germany, and
it is not beyond possibility that France i
may make a third In this coalition.
I believe to-day that the English
army and navy are in a better state of
equipment, organization and fighting
spirit than at any time since Cromwell.
There has been a silent revolution in
both services which cannot be appre
ciated until put to the test.
And, along with all this; it is manifest
â¢ to high and low that politically
and morally there must be no future
differences with America, or if there i
are they must be settled peacefully by
some international supreme court. Re
flections of this nature are uppermost
in the thoughts of Englishmen, consti
tuting for us a golden opportunity,

RUSSIA READY FOR
THE AMEER'S DEATH
NEW YORK, March 4.â A special ca
ble to the Sun from London says:
Nothing has been heard during the
last few days respecting the reported
death of the Ameer of Afghanistan, and
it will be several days yet before re
plies of the Indian Government to in
quiries can be obtained.
In the meantime the prevailing belief
in official quarters is that if the Ameer
is not dead he is a pretty sick man, who
may die at any moment.
Sir Thomas Salter-Pyne, the nervy
Englishman, who for several years oc
cupied the post of the Ameer's chief
engineer and director of the arsenal,
is now safely in Calcutta. He says the
reason he left Afghanistan was that
he could see the Ameer had not l^ng to
live, nnd that no European's life was
worth a minute's purchase after the
Ameer's death.
He has given the Indian Government
information of vital importance, which,
according to semi-official dispatches
rore jved in London to-day, fully justi
fies all the suspicions recently enter
tained of the good faith of Russia,
which has already decided to support
the pretensions to the Afghan throne
of the present Ameer's brother, and has
massed troops within striking distance
of the Afghan frontier.
As far as can be ascertained England
will not actively espouse the cause of
any particular pretender, but will let
the rival elements right it out and will
then support the victor if he is not a
too pronounced Russian protege. This
is scarcely a bold policy and British
timidity will probably make Russian
intlucnce paramount for a time at any
â¢ rate.

WAY OF SETTLEMENT
An Understanding May Be Arrived
At by an Entire Change of Rep

Copyrighted, ISO 9. by the Associated Pr*M.
BERLIN. March 4.â The press de
votes much space this week to the Sa
moan question. The mails have
brought numbers of letters from Ger
mans at Apia and the leading papers
in many capes describe the occurrences
differently from the English and Amer
ican newspapers, putting the blame
upon the English-speaking officials.
The comments of the papers also differ,
but all agree that the tripartite gov
ernment is a failure, and the idea of
the partition of the islands is much
ventilated.
The organs of the colonial party op
pose the suggestion energetically, as it
would put an end to German annexa
tion of the group.
A writer in the Colonial Zeitung, the
leading organ of the party, attempts to
show that the partition of the islands,
even if peaceful, would inevitably lead
to a much worse situation.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press hears on good authority that the
negotiations thus far tacitly assume
that an entire change in the personnel
at Apia of the representative* of the
three powers will be the basis of un
derstanding to be arrived at, and that
this will include the recall of the Amer
ican chief jr.sti< Â«â¢, Chambers; United
States Consul < >sborne, British Consul
M.-ixso. Dr. Raffel. the German presi
dent of the Municipal Council, and Heir
Rose, the German Consul. It is under-
Btood that their removal is necessary
in order to reestablish peace and or
rjpr in the administration of the islands.
The German officials do not attempt to
deny this., though they add it has long
been intended to relieve them at their
own request.
Home of the German newspapers con
tend that a surrender in thiÃ matter
without similar concessions on the
other side will mean a grave loss of
German prestige.
KIPLING LOST NO GROUND.
But Did Not jtfake the Expected

NKW YORK. March 4.â At 9 o'clock to

not made quite as much progress toward

HAVANA, March 4.â ln conversation
with me to-day a member of the Cu
ban Assembly, who is a general in the
army and a close confidant of General
Gomez, made the following extraordi
nary statement, which has weight be
cause of the standing and position of
the man making it:
Firstâ The United States promised
General Gomez that if the offer of
$3,000,000 should be accepted and con
firmed by the Assembly, a further
pum of $10,000,000 would be advanced
to discharge the claims of Cuban sol
diers.
Secondâ A pledge would be given to
General Gomez that as soon as the
Cuban army was .disbanded and the
machinery for taking the vote of the
people was put in operation the United
States would retire from the island,
turning it over to an independent gov
ernment.
Thirdâ until then the American
troops would be reduced to the lowest
number consistent with the preserva
tion of order in the Island.
Fourthâ Gomez affirmed his
ambition to become the first President
of Cuba, and was promised that he
would receive every assistance in ac
complishing this object from the Amer
ican administration.
My informant assures that several
members of the Cuban Assembly have
been taken into Gomez's confidence in
the matter, and that they will strongly
urge the confirmation by that body of
the arrangement to accept the 53,000.

BURNS' DEFEAT
MAY MEAN THE
END OF HERRIN
Mexican's Ambition Creates War in
the Southern Pacific.
PONIATOWSKI ENTERS THE LISTS
Clashing Factions in the Company Will Meet in Con
flict in Juneâ Herrin's Contract as Head of the
Law Department of the Corporation Will
Expire in July.
The ambition of D. M. Burns to be j
United States Senator has created a j
merry war in the Southern Pacific j
Company. Politicians generally, if not i
the public, believe that all is harmony i
in the big yellow building on Mont- |
gomery and Market streets. Those i
who have watched the exciting contest
at Sacramento have been led to under
stand that the railroad has been united- j
ly and heartily in support of the Mcxi- '
can and his absurd aspiration.
It has been whispered around that
Burns, the shameless politician, was to j
win his "vindication" through the rail
road, and that every energy of the
great corporation is being bent to his j
service. This is the falsehood of Ihe ;
Mexican's touts. The facts of the case !
are very different. There are clashing
factions in the Southern Pacific Com- i
pany and D. M. Burns is the cause of ;
the trouble.
The story is an interesting one. Burns
and Will Turn F. Herrin have fraternized â 
for some time. The crafty head of the !
law department of the Southern Pacific
Company has hazarded his official ex
istence upon the success of the Mexi
can. Herrin has undertaken the tre
mendous task of making Burns a
United States Senator, and he has done
so in opposition to the wishes of the
Stanford and Crocker interests in the
Southern Pacific Company.
In his official capacity Herrin repre
sents the Huntington interests. The
head of 'the law department as a mat
ter of course must attend to the po
litical interests of the company. The
only measure of his service that will
be accepted is success. If he fails in j
what he undertakes he knows that his
employers will not be siow to secure the j
Bervtc.es of some one else. Knowing
this, and estimating political conditions j
as he thought they existed, Herrin j
chose D. M. Burns to be the next United
States Senator.
Herrin now finds himself unable to
carry out his contract. He has cajoled,
threatened r.nd begged legislators to
follow his instructions, but has met i
with stubborn opposition from men
that are necessary to the success of
his plans. He finds himself discredited
in his own household. His political j
prophecies have failed and his enemies j
in the Southern Pacific Company are i
taking advantage of his discomfiture, j
He has gone so far as to link his own |
fortunes with those of the Mexican, and j
in the failure of that worthy he is likely j
to find himself on the street looking for j
a job. This condition of affairs has
been kept a profound secret for some
time, but the facts have leaked out and I
are now a mattei of gossip in the clubs ,
and in those circles where the affairs |
LATE SUPPERS
ARE TABOOED
London Custom Irritates
Americans.

Special Cable to The Call and the New Tork
Heral.l. Copyrighted. 1899. by James Gor
don Bennett. .
LONDON, March 4.â There is nothing
more irritating to a visitor to London,
who in American and Continental cities
is able to procure food at any hour of
the day or night, than the difficulty in
getting a meal after evening entertain
ments and while sightseeing on Sun
days. , 1
Even Londoners are beginning to
"kick" against it now. After the thea- j
ters are out, if one wishes supper, and
there are thousands nightly who do,
for many have long distances to travel
into the suburbs before getting home,
it is a case of bolting oysters, cutlets,
'croquettes and the rest with a rapidity
that would try the digestive powers of
an ostrich. But on Saturday nights,
I with the early closing hour, a comfor
table supper after an evening's amuse
ment is impossible.
Just last Saturday supper was or
dered for a very fashionable party at
one of the leading hotels down by the
Thames Embankment. "When they
came from the theater they had only
time to swallow some soup when they
were forced to depart. It was useless
to plead hunger, for the managers knew
very well how 'strictly the police watch
late parties in hotel restaurants. . : â 
Instead of being remedied, the evil is
likely to be aggravated, for the par
liamentary commission on licensing
laws proposes to curtail the hours, for
refreshments, particularly on Sundays.
There are already signs of indigna
PRICE FIVE CEBITS.
i of Herrin and his employers are ques
tions of passing interest.
The matter is not likely to reach a
: climax for several weeks as far as the
Southern Pacific Company is concerned.
i The Stanford and < 'rocker interests in
J the corporation have maintained a de
i termined. hostility to the Huntington
â  clique for some time, but they have
| been unable to gain any material ad-
I vantage. Herrin could rest easily
I therefore, even in the fare of opposi
i tion were it not for the important fact
i that the annual election of directors is
: not so very remote and several impor
i tant changes are likely to happen.
Herrin knows that he has deliberate
ly antagonized the Crocker and Stan
' ford factions b* championing the dis
; graceful cause of Dan Burns. Herrin
knows also that his own contract as
; head of the law department of th<?
! Southern Pacific Company will expire
; in July next, and he must mend his
I fences rapidly or take the chances of
being thrown out. While he has not
: faltered in his allegiance to the Mexi
can he has nevertheless been extend
ing the "glad hand" to his opponents In
the corporation.
His action is perhaps justified, for the
' programme now i.Â« to place Prince Po
niatowski in the directory of the South
i ' crn Pacific Company and add new
1 power to the influence of the Crockers.
j It is the purpose of the Crockers, as
sisted by the Stanford interest, to place
Poniatowskl in the directory at thÂ©
election which will be held next June.
I It Is claimed that Poniatowski is in
j terested in the Southern Pacific Com
! pany to the extent of four million and
j a half dollars, and that he cannot be
| prevented from being a director if he
wishes to be one.
He has frequently declared his oppoÂ«
pition to the policy of Herrin as far as
| the support of the candidacy of Burns
iis concerned. Herrin is fully aware of
this fact, which is important to him in
connection with the other fact that his
contract as head of the law department
of the company expires in July. PoÂ»
! niatowski as a director will then have
i a vote in the choice of the paid attor
ney of the corporation. He has ex
pressed a desire to relieve Mr. Herrin
of his present position, and that worthy
1 gentleman is bothering his brain in an
effort to make both ends meet the situ-
I ation. It is not unlikely therefore that
! the failure of Dan Burns to win a seat
I in the United States Senate may cost
William F. Herrin his 'position as stat
j manipulator of the Southern Pacific
| Company. The destruction of the McxÂ»
ican as a factor of political evil in th.3
State may compel Huntington to rpnr
! ganize his department of law and select
I for it a new head. The end of Dan

South Americans Say the Briton
Lacks Information.

don Bennett.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, March
4.â Cecil Rhodes' predictions about the
absorption of South America by the
United States, which have been printed
here, have been very severely criti
cized. The newspapers agree in saying
Mr. Rhodes only proved that he has
not the slightest idea of conditions in
the South American republics.
Welshmen living in the Chubut terri
tory have sent a communication to the
press declaring they did not authorize
any one to request Great Britain to
establish a protectorate over Chubut.
MEXICO CITY. March 4.â That part
of the Associated Press interview with
Cecil Rhodes regarding the absorption
of Mexico by the United States has ex
cited much comment in press circles.
El Tiempo, the organ of the Clerical
party, is pleased, as it has for years
been predicting what it calls the paci
fic conquest of this country by the
Americans. Rhodes' views, it says,
only accord , with what the paper has
been saying for a long time, and now
this typical English imperialist throws
off the mask and shows the real aim
of the Anglo-Saxons, who aim to con
quer the world. The Tiempo then in
dignantly rebukes Rhodes for havinsr
said that the Latin-American repub
lics were barbarously governed. -
El Correo Espanol, the organ of the
Spanish colony here, says Rhodes is a
terrestrial Drake, alluding to the fa
mous English admiral, who was the
scourge of Spain's shipping and fleet in
the time of Philip 11. It assails Rhodes
as nothing but a filibuster, who made a
fiasco in South Africa.
The Mexican Herald says Rhodes is
plainly unacquainted with the progress
made by Mexico in recent years and
does not comprehend the intensely pa
triotic national sentiment of the Mexi
can people. President Diaz has so firm
ly implanted the ideas of peace here
that when he is dead his ideas will still
rule his fellow countrymen.2

OF THE MEXICAN
Burns' Touts Continue to Run Their Stale
Bluff on the People.
BOASTING PLAYED TO A FINISH
*
Oft Repeated Assertions of Accessions to the Corral of
the Candelaria Candidate Fail to Even Excite
Comment Among Outsiders.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 4.â Two new names
were added to the Democratic li^t of
candidates in the joint ballot to-day.
Twelve votes were cast for Gavin Mc-
Nab ar.d one vote was recorded for
Jesse D. Grant. Assemblyman Fair
weather cast the vote for Jesse and he
expects to get othors in line next week.
Senator Braunhart was the first voter
'Savin Me Nab and the assistant
secretary of the Senate had some diffi
culty m getting the name recorded cor
rectly. "Calvin McGab" was about as
near to the name as the recorder could
get and it went that way until Major
Kyle, the chief clerk of the Assembly,
got it Gavin McNab.
When Senator Feeney's name was
called the assistant secretary of th^
Senate did not clearly understand the
response, "John Rosenfeld," and there
fore. announced "Daniel M. Burns."
This little error caused a deal of half
suppressed merriment as the story has
been going the rounds for several weeks
that the Rosenfeld votes are really
staked out for Burns. Only one ballot
was taken to-day.
The manifesto inspired by Burns and
prepared by Grove Johnson has fallen
flat. The Grant men do not regard it
as worthy of a reply. They maintain
that the majority of the Republican
members of the Legislature settled the
question by a vote of 4S to 29 and that
Burns must abide by the will of the
majority.
The Grant forces are as firm as ever,
but the Burns people are holding out
the suggestion of a combination of
Grant and Burns to bring about the
election of a Senator. The truth is that
Burns is making a strong effort to cap
ture pome of the Grant men. but there
are no signs to-night of success in that
direction.
The "Colonel" is putting on a cheer
ful front this evening. Grove Johnson
made the declaration in the Assembly
to-day that Burns would be elected
Senator next Wednesday. The an
nouncement did not create a panic.
There are no indications to-night of a
break to get into the Burns corral. Dan
pays a visit every day to Colonel Jack
Wright's office at the depot and it is
presumed that Herrin at the San Fran
cisco end of the wire imparts words
of cheer to the railroad's candidate.
A NEW HARBOR
COMMISSION BILL
IN THE SENATE
Changes Made to Meet the
Objections to the Old
Measure.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 4.â Senator Dickinson's
bill to re-ostablish the Harbor Commis
sion came up for consideration by the
Senate this morning, but all that was
done was to receive a subsitute sub
mitted by Dickinson. In submitting his
substitute Dickinson referred to the ad
verse report of the Committee on Com
merce, Harbors 6nd Rivers and said the
"substitute was offered for the purpose of
meeting some of the objections made to
the original bill In the committee. â¢ The
new act is as follows:
An act to amend sections 2520, 2521 and 2552
of the Political Code relating to the Board of
State Ilarbor Commissioners, on establishing
the said board and defining certain of its
powers and duties, ; together with the terms i
of office and compensation of Its officers and
appointees.
The people of the State of California, repre
. sÂ«-nted in Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows:
Section Iâ Section 2520 of the Political Code
is hereby amended to read as follows: . .
2520â A Board of State Harbor Commission
ers, to consist of five persons, is hereby con
stituted with such powers and duties as are
prescribed by law. Each of said Commission
ers shall hold office for the term of four years,
provided that of those first appointed under
this act, two shall hold office for the term
of three years and one for the term of four
years from the date of their respective com
missions and until their successors are ap
pointed and qualified, and the two members
of the existing board having the longest terms
to serve under their present appointment shall
be members of the ' board hereby created for
the unexpired portions of their . respective
terms, under and by virtue of their appoint
ment and- qualification on the existing board.
X'pon the expiration of each of the terms of
the' Commissioners last named, his successor
shall be appointed and hold office for four
years. Such appointment shall be made in
all respects as those of other Commissioners
provided for in this act. All of said Commis
sioners must thereafter be nominated by the
Governor, and by and with the consent of
the Senate, be appointed for four years from
the dates of their respective commissions and
until their successors aie qualified. If the
term of office of any Commissioner expire dur
ing the recess of the Senate, the Governor mugt
grant a commission to his successor; which
shall be valid to all intent* and purposes, sub
ject, however, to the content of the Senate
at Its next regular session. If a vacancy occur
from any cause in ihe office of a Commissioner
before the expiratton of his term, his suc

for the unexpired portion of such term. ! .In

Outside of the corral the opinion is
almost universal that Burns is prac
tically out of the race. He may be able
to execute his threat that no Senator
shall be elected, but he cannot do more
than prolong the deadlock. The best
informed touts take this view of the
situation. The game of looking wise
and boasting has been played to a
finish.
Three weeks aga Dibble held up one
finger and remarked: "When the break
comes every man in the Bulla camp
except oneâ all but oneâ will go to
Colonel Burns." The break did come
and not one man of the Bulla forces
went to Burns. Assemblyman Cosper,
who was counted as a sure Burns man,
went to Scott, and men who know him
best assert positively that he will never
go to Burns.
General Barnes left the capital for
San Francisco to-day and will return
to-morrow evening. He is receiving
many messages of good cheer from
every section of the State. A promi
nent Republican of San Joaquin Coun
ty writing to him and wishing him suc
cess adds this comment:
"What a peculiar condition of affairs
it is, when men, who, if running before
the people, would stand no possible
chAnce of election can gain votes in
the Legislature over men who, if the
people had the popular say in the mat
ter, would be elected by an overwhelm
ing majority. The members of the Leg
islature cannot be blind to the almost
unanimous Republican sentiment of the
State in favor of yourself. How they
can act in such willful disregard of this
sentiment is more than I can under
stand. However, there are more things
in politics than are dreamed of in all of
the philosophy of the world."
It is expected that Irving M. Scott
will return to the scene of the struggle
next Monday. U. S. Grant iÂ» here and
has not been away from Sacramento
since the battle began. He is obvious
ly the most unconcerned man at the
capital. Nothing disturbs him. The
keen observer can readily see that
Burns' tranquillity is artificial, but
Grant's is natural. The rumors which
disturb and worry his followers do not
affect Grant in the slightest degree.
There may be something like an or
ganized effort upon the part of certain
Democrats next week to bring Jesse
Grant prominently into the Senatorial
race with the hope of catching some
Republican support to break the dead
lock.
each of the other commissioners in the sum

Governor and State Treasurer by written en

after the date of their respective commissions,

Secretary of State, together with the official
oath urescribed by law. The commissioners
shall not be sureties for one another, nor shall
any officer of the State, nor any officer or

other officers, appointees and attaches of the
said board shall hold office at the pleasure of
the board. The board may require such bonds,
except from the secretary, from all officers and

best.

ASSEMBLYMEN ARE
GETTING IRRITABLE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 4.â Senator Sammy
Braunhart's fender bill came up In the
Assembly again to-day, raised a rough
house for a half hour or so and then went
to the unfinished business file because the
hour for the consideration of Senate bills
had expired. Dibble attempted to break
one of his own unique rules by moving
to have the hour extended for a long
enough time to call the roll on the final
passage of the bill, but the House would
not stand for It. It called the time limit
on him. Then Dibble left his scat and
went to File Clerk Gyries' desk and
quietly told him to record the, bill on the
finished business file and state with It that
j the previous question had been ordered
: and stood against the rollcall. This will
j preclude further debate when the bill
| comes up on Monday and the bill will
stand with the one amendment Dibble
; has added to it, which throws the whole
fender matter into the hands of County
Boards of -Supervisors.
Laird's coyote scalp bill came up, and
I Belshaw wanted to deny It a second read
; ing. Kelsey had some amendments to
! offer, and Belshaw withdrew his motion
that the Santa Claran might have time
to print his changes in the Journal.
When Senate bill 27 came up Oamlnetti
attacked it vigorously. The bill is de
signed to enable the Santa Fe Railroad to
purchase and amalgamate as a part of
i its system the San Joaquin Valley road,
! and it is championed by all of the south
! em members and most of those from the
: north. Mr. Caminetti saw in it a measure;
not to be considered hastily, and had the
; temerity to say so. He was interrupted
ill-naturedly by Dibble, who said it was
| too late in the fif-ssion to make a political
i speech. Caminetti replied by demanding
< that the bill be referred to the Judiciary
! Committee. Valentine explained the
' harmless intent of his measure, but Cami-
I netti insisted, and made his demand a
motion. It was carried, and the bill went
: to committee. .
Assemblyman Hoey, who yesterday
! gave notice that to-day he would move to
! reconsider the vote by which the Folsom
I road bill was passed, called the matter
up, but it was lost by a motion to lay on
the table.
Valentine's motion to reconsider the re
i port which was submitted yesterday by
the Committee on Attaches met the same
fate.
At to-night's session the newspaper

was made by the minority to amend the
bills back to the original sums, but they
were voted down. The bills were given
their second reading and will come tip for
third next week. '
Gage's numerous vetoes were the special
order for 11 o'clock. The Governor's ve
toes have come in lately with much regu
larity, but have been flatly ignored. They
were finally made the order for to-night
and were ignored again.
Grove L. Johnson got news during the
evening that Governor Gage had vetoed
the Mullan claim, in which Mr. Johnson
Is interested. "I guess." said Johnson,
"the Governor has heard that I voted to
down his golden poppy veto." Then Mr.
Johnson made a quick little motion to ad
journ, and it was carried before even Mr.
Dibble knew it. Governor Gage's vetoes
were left dangling on the hie. Dibble
wanted to consider them any way. Ad
journment did not make any difference,
but Johnson and the rest only laughed,
and the session was called off until Mon
day. _^
MORTGAGE TAX EXEMPTION
AMENDMENT PASSED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA-,
MEXTO, March 4.â There was a few min
utes of redhot debate this morning when
Assemblyman Mead's constitutional
amendment No. 19 came up In the As
sembly for final action.
Mr. Mead's amendment exempts from
taxation growing crops, trust deeds and
mortgages. Its principal features are as
follows:
Section 1 All property in the State not ex
empt under the laws of the United States, or
this constitution, shall be taxed in proportion
to its valuf to be ascertained as provided l>s
law ' The word "property." as used in this

used exclusively for public schools, and nidi
as may belong to the United States, this Stati
or to any county or municipal corporation

this amendment shall not apply to mortgage.-?
and trust deeds executed prior to the date this

said that under the present law the mort
gage tax works a hardship on the bor
rower; that the original intent was that
the lender should assume the tax, but
that as it Is at present the borrower was
compelled to pay It. *
Wade of Napa said that he was against
the bill for the reason that the present
law had operated successfully, and he
could see no reason for changing it now.
Dibble and Judge Clough sided with
Mead and the amendment was adopted
with few votes cast in its disfavor. â¢
MULLAN'S CLAIM
GETS THE VETO
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 4.â With a willing stroke
of his pen the Governor to-day punctured
one of Assemblyman Johnson's best be
loved bills. It appropriated $45,616 30 to
pay th<3 claim of John Mullan for collect
ing $225,081 51 due from the Federal Gov
ernment to the State.
The claim which the Governor has killed
dates back to* the Civil War. At that time
there was a "direct war tax" levied upon
the various States, which provided for an
annual income of $20,000,000. California's
share of this was $254,538 66. Of this
amount the State paid $247,445 41. leaving
a balance still due of $7003 26.
In December of 18S2 Mullan was ap
pointed by Governor Perkins to collect
this tax from the Federal Government,
which had by that time started to pro
vide for ihe paying back of the war tax,
and his appointment was ratified by the
Legislature in the spring of ISB3. This
ratification was made by concurrent reso
lution, and in addition to ratifying his
appointment the Legislature fixed Mul
lan's compensation at 20 per cent of any
amount he should collect.
The first installment of the tax was paid
back to the State in July of 1884. It
I amounted to $38,676 52. but before it was
finally turned over $7093 26 was deducted,
the balance due from the State to the
Federal Government. The balance of the
amount to be refunded, $31,583 26 was paid
over to Mullan and he turned it into tho
State treasury and received ln return
$77.15 30, a 20 per cent commission on
$. i W,676 52, instead of on $31,583 26. the
amount actually collected, or an excess
I of $1418 95.
In -February of 1888 Governor Water
! man revoked Mullan's appointment aa

cause that the work was a matter for leg
islation and did not call for the services
AMUSEMENT FOR
THE MINORITY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO, March 4.â "Whisper
ing" Gavin McNab was the Dem
ocratic choice in the Senatorial
ballot to-day. His candidacy was
sprung, badly., by Senator Sammy
Braunhart, who called attention to
his entrance into the Assembly
chamber with the startling an
nouncement that he was "going to
switch."
Assemblyman Fairweather. Dem
ocrat, switched to Jesse D. Grant,
whose politics has never been as
certained, and Senator Langford
made another flop, this time to
Phelan.
Altogether the minority spent a
very pleasant half-hour.
In the Republican ranks there
was no change and no incident to
mark the balloting. But one bal
lot was taken and that resulted as
follows:

of an agent. He declared the expenses of
an agent could and should be saved. But
Mullan paid no heed to the revocation of
his appointment and went right along
with his lobbying: in Washington.
It was in IKiil that Congress became tired
of the persistence of the agents for the
various States who were working for the
State claims, and it passed a resolution
providing that the State claims be not
paid if any part of them was to go to any
agent for their collection.
The Legislature of California accepted
this condition and in the same year the
Governor received a draft from the Fed
eral Government for $208,246 89. and then a
little later another for the balance due,
$8110 98.
Despite the fact that these amounts
were paid after the appointment of Mullan
had been revoked, he claimed the credit
of securing the money and demanded hia
20 per cent commission.
It was refused and he sued for the
amount, but the courts would have none
of his contentions. His suit was defeated
on th=! point that the appointment had
been Illegally made; that the appointment
by the Governor in the first place was not
legal, and the subsequent ratification by
the Legislature by concurrent resolution
did not make It so. Mullan was further
advlaed that it was his business to know
how far the powers of the Legislature
went in the matter of appointments, and
he accepted a defective one at his own
peril.
In view of this decision and the revoca
tion of Mullan's appointment by Gover
nor Waterman before the bulk of tho
claim was paid In and In view of the fact
that he Is ahead of the. State over $1000
anyway, the Governor vetoed the bill pro
viding for his claim.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MKNTO, March. 4.â For the first time
since the beginning of this legislative ses
sion the Senate convened on a Saturday
afternoon to-day. The Senate was re
luctant, too, and the sergeant-at-arms
had to hunt the Capitol over to find Sen
ators to make up the quorum. It was a
bad beginning, for only this morning a
resolution from the Committee on Rules
added another half hour to the day's ses
sion, beginning next Monday, by order
ing the morning convention of the Son

Smith's Registration Bill Approved.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 4.â Senator Smith's bill
providing for a new method of registra
tion has found the approval of the Gov
ernor, who so reported to the Senate in
a message submitted this evening.
Senator Smith's bill provides for the
abolition of the great registers and for the
registration of a' voter by a system of
affidavits similar to the ones now sworn
to before a registrar. Instead of having
the facts contained in these printed in a
register the bill provides that copies of
the affidavits themselves shall be bound
and used as a register at the polling
places.
The idea Is that when a voter appears
at the polls he shall figrn his name, and
his signature as well as his description as
it appears on the affidavit shall be the
:nean3 of identifying him. It is claimed
that a comparison of the signature writ
ten in the booth and the one affixed to the
affidavit will form a method of i.leiuili
cation which cannot be beaten. The mil
further provides for a -small index of the
hound affidavit, which will bo mailed to
each voter in order that he may assure
himself that he is properly represented
in the register so formed. The act will
do aw;-y with thousands of dollars in

ketborough, England, in January, 1834,
and from his tenth year was associat
ed with Jlis father, the founder of the
famous excursion business, in its exec
utive management. In ISSI he was his
father's chief assistant in the already
large enterprise handled by Thomas
Cook in conveying 165,000 persons to
the gieat British exhibition, and con
tinued working in connection with his
father until 1856, when he accented an
appointment as noting superintendent
of excursion traffic of the Midland
Railroad of England. In 1864 the excur
sion business Increased to such an ex
tent that Mr. Cook joined his father
permanently.
CREEK CHIEF" REPORTED DEAD.
Ishparhecher Said to Have Been Sum
moned Before the Manitou.
MUBKOGBB, I. T.. March 4.â lt is
reported here that Ishparhecher, prin
cipal chief of the Creek Indians, is dead
at Okmulgee, capital of the Creek Na-
I tion. The rumor cannot be verified.

readily appealed to them. They were
ready to-day for anything that showed
the alluring twinkle of dollar marks,
but they were not of sufficient num
ber to carry the plan into effect. John
son had a forlorn hope and he knew it,
but he stood by Mr. Kenneally's
nel Dann M. Burns" faithfully in :h>
face of the Speaker and the decent
ment in the chamber.
Johnson made no further attemnt
during the day to call up the resolu
tions, but in speaking about the ques
tion of an extra session later, he said;
"If an extra session is called it will
be empowered to elect a Senator
whether such object is included in the
call or not. When Senator Stanford
died in office, Senator Hearst was ap
pointed to succeed him. Shortly after
this, in the summer of 1886, the Legis
lature met in extra session to con
sider irrigation matters. In the mean
time the Legislature had become Re
publican and some one moved that a
Senator be elected. It was so ordered,
and A. P. Williams was chosen. 2,iorc
than this, Williams was seated."
Johnson's attention was called to the
fact that if he, as one of Burns' lead
ers, should move to adjourn sine die it
might be construed to mean that the
Mexican had given up the fight. In
reply to this he said: "If such an in
terpretation is to be placed on the move
I shall be opposed to again bringing
the matter up. I have from the start
favored an adjournment at the end of
sixty days. I am confident that D. M.
Burns will be elected United States
Senator next Wednesday. I now make
the statement that he will be elected
Senator on next Wednesday at noon.
Rather than have any false reports
about this thing go out. I shall not
again bring up the resolution to ad
journ." *
Okmulgee is quarantined on account of
smallpox, which is epidemic there
Ishparhecher was a full blood Creek
Indian and for four years had been the
principal chief of his people. Ever since
he became a leader among the Â» reeks,
Ishparhecher fought all legislation
tending to change the tribal conditions
in the Territory, and only recently he.
was practically forced into giving his
consent to the negotiations of the
treaty between his people and the
Dawes Commission. The sterling hon
esty and the indomitable will of the
aged chief made him much respected
among both Indians and whites.

readiness to hoist the flag. The troops,
if twenty-six men can be called troops,
were drawn up in the courtyard. A
crowd gathered in the street, eager to
see the new President take possession
of his seven years' lease, but M. Lou
hot did not arrive.
Quite heedless of M. Crozier or any
thing else, he had pone for a drive as
far as the Arc ds Triomphe. When he
reached the Elysee at about 6 o'clock
many people had grown tired of wait
ing, go M. Loubet wuh able to make his
entry without commotion. This demo
cratic simplicity must endear him to
Fiance. As a matter of fact, the only
real reproach ever made against 51.
Faure was on the score of his love of
display. It is therefore only another
: cc of cups'edness of human na
ture that the very papers that teased
M. Faure for his ostentation are now
puking fun at M. Loubet for his lack
of it.
He if evidently in sympathy with a
Deputy who, during a discussion in the
i number about Faure's funeraJ,
shouted "A bas le protocole!" while an
other made an expressive gesture in
dicating that he was sitting on this
code ceremonial.
M. Loubet, in spite of his careless
ness in regard to the protocole. has
won hands down in the first encounter
which he has had in the field of cere
mony. After this who dare say that
M. Crozier is useless, even in democ
racy. In one respect the new occu
pant of the Elysee is a decided chance
from his predecessors. Although M.
Faure lover a cigar, and one of the
last little jokes about him was that he
was going to put a new cigar bearing
hi? name on the market, he smoked
in moderation.
M. Loubet, on the other hand, smokes
like Vesuvius. He is rarely without a
pipe in his mouth and would surely
have been held in horror by M. Thiers,
who hated both tobacco and those who
smoked. One bond of union between
him and M. Jules Faure was their
equally strong detestation of the weed.
From these details you will see there
is no immediate likelihood of revolu
\ tion. M. Deroulede's frothing over has
given just the requisite note of gayety
to the rather lugubrious events of the
past two weeks.
As solace there has now come to these j
men the knowledge that Mr. Hanna's ;
star gained experience in the art of
rising and setting gracefully in the
cities of Stockton and Santa Rosa,
where there are several merchants who
would delight to interview him on other
subjects than what it is like to be the
blood relation of a distinguished states
man.
C. B. Hanna came to San Rafael in
the latter part of last October. He was
a large, well-built man, of distinguished
presence and pleasing personality. In
a quiet and unassuming manner he in
formed leading citizens that he was a
cousin of Mark Hanna and supplied
them with documentary proof of his
statements in the shape of several let
tors. He announced his intention to
make his future abode in the realm of
society and was received with open
arms. The weekly papers gave notice
of his arrival and notified the public
of the honor that had been voluntarily
accorded the town. Not a merchant
was there who did not jump at the op
portunity to oblige the new resident
and most of them were privileged in
that resp< I
The first thing Mr. Hanna did was to
rent a beautiful cottage on Petaluma
avenue, which he furnished lavishly.
In a short time a daughter named Mrs.
Cherry and her husband came to live
with him.
Mr. Hanna opened an account with
several of the leading merchants and i
deepened the excellent* impression he
had made at first by calling around
and settling accounts punctually on the
Ist of the month. He did this once, and
if the practice had been kf>pt up there
would have been no trouble, but ad
cording to the dealers themselves it
wasn't.
As time rolled on and Mr. Hanna's
bills increased seme of his creditors
grew a little bit uneasy. Among them
were C. Grosjean & Co., who wrote to
friends in Santa Rosa to learn of the
previous standing of their debtor. A
proiJHnerit merchant of Santa i
George King, answered the inquiry and
declared Mr. Hanna was a "dt-ad beat"
and had left there several hundred dol
lars in debt. Hanna was further char.
acterlzed as a "slippery one," and the
firm was told to "keep an eye on him."
About the same time Marshal John
Healy received a letter from another
Santa Rosa merchant, Kdward Carter,
who said Hanna left there owing nearly
Healy was requested to "put
everybody on" or somebody would "get
left." He informed Prey & Co., whole
sale liquor dealers and creditors of the
statesman's cousin, of the communica
tion. Messrs. Prey and Grosjean there
upon drew the line at further credit and
the fun began.
Grosjean intimated that he wanted
his money and kept so persistently after
it that he gr,-t all but a small amount.
Frey was not so fortunate and bewails
the loss of about $50. Mrs. Saiinders,
who rented Hanna her cottage, also got
the coin fever, and after a deal of per
suasion got the major portion of what
was coming to her from him. It is as
serted that there are other creditors
wh'i were not so fortunate.
Last Monday evening Hanna's furni
ture was packed and expressed to the
broad gauge depot, where it was stored
on account of a failure of the owner
ito prepay the freightage. Mr. Hanna.
his daughter and her husband then
departed without the friendly cere

mony of telling their acquaintances
very much about it. A day or two ago
Hanna was seen on the streets of San
Francisco by R. M. Donne.
Mr. Frey says he would not * rust
Hanna any further, when he learned
of his Santa Rosa record from Mar
shal. Healy. He calls his debtor a
â¢dead beat," and says he will get his
money by retaining the furniture under
due process of law, if necessary. He
believes the reason Hanna left town so
suddenly was that he (Frey) let so
many townspeople know of his record
in the past. ._*.Â«.
It was asserted by Hanna that he
formerly lived in Stockton, and he pro
fessed an intimate acquaintance with
ex-Governor Budd and other well
known persons of that city. He was
accustomed to speak of his business
dealings as if he were worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars, and there were
few men here that would not at one
time have indorsed his note for any
amount of money.
S\NTA ROSA, "March 4.â C. B.
Hanna came to this city, presumably
from Stockton, about two years ago.
He was known as "Colonel" Hanna and
was a veteran of the Civil War. hav
ing served as an officer in the Tenth
Massachusetts Regiment He asserted
that he was a cousin of Mark Hanna
and proved his claim not only by cor
respondence, but by securing a pension
through his relative.
When Hanna left here In October last
hp left unftaid bills aggregating hun
dreds of dollars. He was always prom
ising to pay these bills, and said he ex
pected to get "back pension money"
through the influence of his cousin
Mark. He departed without paying
Otto Fox, a dry goods merchant, the
sum of $200 he had owed" for several
months. D. T^eppo, a furniture dealer,
to whom about $100 was due. never got
a cent of that amount. George King,
a grocer, also lost about $50 by trust
ing Hanna. Small bills of Fred King,
a stableman, and Frank Ross, a wood
and coal dealer, were left unpaid.
Leppo did not lose the full amount of
his bill, taking a number of articles of
furniture back before Hanna left town.
It was wholly owing to his relation
ship with his cousin Mark that Hanna
secured any credit at all. At one time
he was arrested and placed in jail for
drunkenness. When he was searched
all that was found on his person were
a nickel and a quart bottle full of
whisky.

FUGITIVE YOUNG
NOW IN CANADA
Hr.E33Sr:R,Y YOTT2STG.
SAN RAFAEL. March 4.â When Henry
Young, the alleged lire fiend of Tiburon.
"jumped" his ball and fled the country
prior to his preliminary examination be
fore Justice Rodden, he evidently desired
to put as many miles between him and
the scene of his alleged crime as possible.
Sheriff Taylor received information to
day that Young is in British Columbia,
and will take steps to have him brought
bark, if he ran be apprehended before hÂ«
leaves there.
The- information reached Taylor through
a friend who knew of a letter that Young
had sent to a bosom friend in Tiburon.
This bosom friend grew talkative after
partaking of too much wine, and the se
cret came out. Sheriff Taylor thinks that
i Young can be arrested without any
trouble. Whether or not he can be extra
dited will have to be learned later. If
Young is brought back and made to stand
trial there will be rejoicing at Tiburon.
The case against him to much stronger
than that against his wife.

GOOD WORDS.
Though the Men Are Suffering From

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. March 4.â Walter S.
Martin, lieutenant colonel and aid-de
camp on the Governor's staff, writing
from Manila, lias reported to Adjutant
General Peeler with reference to the
condition of the National Guard of Cal
ifornia on duty in the Philippines.
The colonel says the California Vol

uous by gallantry, by their position al
ways in the front and by good discipline
and good spirit. He quotes Captain W.
E. Birkhimer, U. S. A., acting inspector
general. Eighth Army Corps, as having
said the military bearing and appear
ance of the troops were line. The colo
nel reports the First Californians as ap
pearing exceedingly well at the inspec
tion, in their khaki uniforms. The re
port further states:
As to the question of returning home,
I think that the officers and men would
at any time bo glad to receive a sum
mons. Their families, business interests
and a natural desire to exchange the in
conveniences wbicb they moot with here
for the pleasures of home, would explain
this. I rtoul.t if any interrogation would
<â li.it a request to this effect. The health,
quarters and living, at present, are as
good as it is possible to expect, and tne
prospect of winning new glorii s and a
chance to fipht has quelled all idea and
talk of returning. However, the hot s.-a
-son is coming on, and it will go hard with
our men in camp, or in the field, and.
there fore, if any action is proposed in
this matter, it should be Settled immedi
ately so as to avoid the unfavorable con
ditions here, and the discomforts attend
ant upon travel on the transports in hot
weather and during the typhoon season.

WAR CONGRESS DIES
WITH CHEERS FOR
ADMIRAL DEWEY
Thrilling Close of the
House's Session.
ALL BILLS ARE DISPOSED OF
JOE WHEELER TRIES IN VAIN
TO MAKE A SPEECH.
Then Follow the Resolution of
Thanks to Speaker Reed and
Patriotic Songs, in Which
All Join.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, March 4.â Wearily
the House sat through the silent
watches of the night, taking recess
from time to time while awaiting con
ference reports upon the appropriation
bills. The floor of the House was lit
tered with waste papers, which drifted
ankle deep about the desks and made
the hall look as if it had been swept
by a snowstorm. Still the weary and
! heavy-eyed legislators kept to their
posts through the night. The leaders,
upon whom the strain and burden of
the closing hours fell most heavily, and
the Speaker, who had the greatest re
sponsibility of all, remained constantly
in their places watching vigilantly the
progress of the contests between the
two houses.
The final agreement on the river and
harbor bill, containing the compromise
on the Nicaragua canal, was secured
about 3:30 a. m., the sundry civil bill,
in which the House forced the Senate
to surrender the provision for the Pa
cific cable, about 6 o'clock; the District
| of Columbia bill, the provision for
I .sectarian institutions eliminated, about
i 7 o'clock; the deficiency bill at 8:30. and
the final conference report upon the
naval bill at about 9:30 a. m.
A'out 7 o'clock Henderson aroused the
House- by an electric speech. It was one
of the most eloquent of this Congress.
! The surroundings added lmpressiveness
to his utterances. The disheveled mem
bers and the wreckage of the night were
about him. It was on the question of
sectarian Institutions in the District of
Columbia, provision for which had been
stricken >ut of the district appropriation
bill. Wit!; foice anl pathos he denounced
the bigotry of the conferees, who. ho said,
were willing, at the bt he^t of a secret or
ganization "to turn the homeless and
friendless into the streets. Tne scene was
dramatic in the extreme when Henderson
recalled the dark days of the war, when
i the white.-capped sisters of mercy were
j administering on the battlefield to the sick
: and dying soldiers.
With the advent of the day the House
again took on the appearance of life.
Members went below for baths and break
fast and returned refreshed to their st<.
tions. As early as 7:30 the people began
to pour into the galleries. The important
business of the House had been virtually
completed when the House took a recess
for an hour at 9:30. All that remained was
the enrollment of bills and the final cere
monies.
At 10:30, when the House reconvened, the
galleries were again packed to the doors,
and the hall buzzed with the confused
murmur of Voices.
At 11:15 o'clock the assistant door
keeper, with a long pole, set hack the
hands ten minutes. This raised a loud
laugh. Immediately afterward came a
most dramatic episode.
General Wheeler of Alabama, who has
carefully refrained from exercising his
privilege as a member of the House,
pending the determination of the ques
tion as to his right to his seat in the
House, arose from his old seat down near
the front on the Democratic side an..
loudly asked for recognition. â 
"Mr. Speaker!" he called.
The Speaker's face wm flushed slightly,
but he looked straight ahead as if he did
not hear.
"I ask unanimous consent to speak for
five minutes," shouted the general. But
the Speaker disregarded him. Every eye
was now riveted upon the diminutive fig
ure of the grizzled old veteran of two
wars. The situation was intensely dra
matic, but Payne, the floor leader of the
majority, htirried to the rescue. He
moved a recess for ten minutes.
"Pending that I ask unanimous consent,
to speak for three minutes," demanded
General Wheeler.
The Speaker then Uiraed toward him
for the first time, aid, looking straight
into the gray eyes of the general, ig
nored his request completely, putting
the motion of Payne and declaring it car
ried.
As the hands of the clock pointed to
seven minutes to 12, although it was really
three minutes past that hour, the com
mittee appointed to wait upon the Presi
dent marched down the aisle.
The Speaker had retired to his room and
Payne, the Speaker pro tern., was in thr
chair. Dalzeli. in the center, announced
that the committee had fulfilled its duty
and that the President had made reply
| that he had no further communication to
make.
"The President requested us to state,"
he continued, "that the Fifty-fifth Con
! press had performed its extraordinary dv
! ties manfully, and he requested me to ex
j tend to each and every member his West
| wishes for his safe return to his home."
Great applause greeted this announce
j ment. But five minutes remained. In it
I was enacted one of the most dramatic
Rcenee ever witnessed in the Hall of Rep
resentatives. Payne summoned Dockery
of Missouri to the chair, and he in turn
recognized Bailey, the minority leader in
this Congress, to present the resolutions
thanking the Speaker for the Impartial
manner in which he had presided over the
deliberations of the House. A great hush
fell upon the vast concourse in the gal
leries as Bailey began to speak.
In his speech Bailey said: "It is an ad
mirable trait of the American character
and it is one which will tend to the per
manence of our institutions, that no mat
ter how we may contend with each other
over our differences of opinion each is
always ready to accord to the other what
ever praise "may be deserved. This com
mendable spirit has led some ahallo'w
men to criticize us because they could not
comprehend how we could so strenuously
combat the principles of our adversaries
and still respect those adversaries them
selves. These men do not know that a
large majority of the men in every party
of this cofmtry sincerely believe that a
large majority of the men in every other
party are earnestly anxious to promote
our country's welfare. (Applause.) And
I it Is out of this broader spirit that a cus
tom has grown which is as old as the
House itself, that in the closing hours of
every session there shall be offered a reso
j lution like that which I now send to the
clerk's desk.
The resolution was read as follows:
"Resolved, That the thanks of the
I House are tendered to the Hon. Thomas
1 B. Reed for the able, impartial and digni
fied manner In which he naÃ presided over
its deliberations and performed the ardu
ous and important duties of the chair
man."
| The reading of the resolution was greet
] ed with tumultuous applause.
"Mr. Speaker." continued Bailey, "we
i have- not always agreed with the dlstin
! guiahed occupant of the chair, and we
' have taken more than one occasion to
emphasize our dissent, but. remembering
I the momentous questions which have con
j fronted us in this Congress, and remem
bering, too, the Intense excitement which
! they aroused throughout the country as
wefl as in this hall, the wonder is that
I those occasions were so few. and in this
I hour of impartial retrospect I do not hesi
tate to say that he has been as fair to us
and nur side as any one of us. were our
positions reversed, would have been to
him and to his side." ("Loud applause.)
The chair called for a rising vote. Every
member was on his feet, and the resolu
tion was unanimously agreed to, amid
prolonged applause.
Speaker Reed was escorted back to the
chair. Slowly and with great deliberation
he returned his thanks for the compli
ment the House had conferred upon him.
Half a dozen times during the progress
of his remarks the Speaker was obliged
to pause owing to the spontaneous ap
plause which arose from all sides, and
when he concluded with the announce
ment that the House stood adjourned sine
die the applause and cheers were deafen
ing. The galleries joined the outburst.
Suddenly some members down near the
rostrum began singing, and above the din
arose the strains of "My Country, Tls ot
Thee."
It was a scene to live a lifetime to wit
ness and a fitting and patriotic climax
for the great war Congress. Down in
front the gallant General Henderson, with
his cane aloft, was beating time for the
air, while all around on the floor and in
the galleries the inspiring words poured
out in immense volume. The emotional
side of the vast concourse was touched,
and there were tears in many eyes. When
the anthem was concluded General Hen
derson started "Auld Lang Syne," and it
also was sung with a will.
Suddenly John Murray Mitchell waved
aloft a small American flag and members
and galleries went wild, joining in singing
"The Red, White and Blue."
While the singing was in progress Hull
of Hull bill fame jumped on a desk with
a large red, white and blue streamer,
waving it to the rhythm of the air and
redoubling the tumult. A voice from the
gallery shouted, "Three cheers for
Dewey!" and they were given with vio
lence and explosive vigor. Then there
were three cheers for the army and navy
and finally for "Joe" Wheeler. This won
derful demonstration concluded with the
singing of the "Doxology."

IMPORTANT BILLS
ARE FINALLY PASSED
Legislation Accomplished by Con
gress During the Closing Hours
of the Session.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â Several Im-
, portant bills of general legislation pending
when the review of the legislation of the
| past Congress was made by the Asso
ciated Press a week ago have become
laws since the summary was published
The most important of these are the army
reorganization bill, the navy personnel
hill, the bill providing a code of laws for
I Alaska, the omnibus claims bill and nu
! merous important public building bills.
The project for the construction of a
canal across the isthmus of Nicaragua
made progress to the extent that a pro
vision was attached to the river and har
! bor appropriation, providing for a very
I complete inquiry into the matter. The
: addition of a. provision to the army ap
propriation bill forbidding the grant of
j property franchises in Cuba was also an
: important legislative act.
Among the important projects which
i failed to receive favorable attention in the
j closing days were those providing a Pa
cific cable, for a Government armor plant,
; for an antl-scalplng law, for an eight-hour
law and for a Government -for Hawaii.
The navy personnel bill completely re
organizes the navy, and is the consumma
tion of years of earnest effort by the Navy
Department. The original army bill was
intended to meet the same want for the
army supplied to the navy by the per
; sonnel bill, but it failed, and the present
j bill Is considered defective in that it is
i only a temporary measure. It. however,

â  WASHINGTON, March 4. â Vice
President Hobart declared the Senate
of the Fifty-fifth Congress adjourned |
without day eight minutes after 12 j
o'clock to-day. It was after a contin
uous session, beginning at 11 o'clock on
Friday, with the exception of one hour
recess during the forenoon.
The day of final adjournment broke
with the Senate in executive session,
disposing of a large number of nomi- j
nations. When the doors were opened
there was seen but a handful of tired j
and haggard looking Senators who were
waiting for the final reports from the j
conferees on the two bills yet in dis- j
pute. Finally Hale appeared with both, j
The deficiency bill was quickly passed, j
and then came the final and closing j
light on the naval bill and the price j
of armor plate and for an armor plate i
factory. This was finally over and the j
weary Senators took a short rest.
Upon reassembling the Senate took
on a new appearance. The chamber
had been cleaned up and the Senators
came back to the closing n.eeting with j
a more spruce appearance. Some few i
attempts at legislation were made, but
all were unsuccessful. Then the gal- j
leries tilled with gaily dressed visitors, j
who were there to see the final cere
monies. They were not long permitted
to enjoy themselves as an executive
session drove them into the corridors,
where they patiently waited for the j
doors to be opened. When this was done
only five minutes remained of the Con
gress, but the hands of the clock were
turned back ten minutes to give time
for the usual complimentary resolutions
and the address of the Vice President.
President McKinley and his entire
Cabinet had come to the Capitol and
were in the President's room back of
the Senate chamber, where the various
bills were hurried for signature. Finally
the last big appropriation bill had re
ceived the President's approval and
everything was ready for the close. The
resolution thanking Vice President Ho
bart and President pro tern. Frye was
adopted and the Vice President re
sponded in an appropriate address and
the Senate, which had been in a tur
moil for several days, quietly came to
an end.
At 8 o'clock the Senate resumed busi
ness in legislative session. Soon after
ward Hale of Maine presented the confer
ence report on the general deficiency
bill, and it was agreed to without division.
At 8:30 a. m. Hale presented the con
ference report on the naval bill, and it
was submitted to the Senate. Hale said
that perhaps there was never an appro
| priation bill concerning which the action j
of the conferees was 'beset with more j
difficulties than this bill. He announced i
that the House had refused absolutely to
authorize the construction of a Govern- '
ment, armor plate factory. Hale explained !
that the report of the conference commit
tee fixed the price of armor for the ships
authorized by this bill at |300 a ton, no
contract for the hulls to oe made until
contracts had been made for the armor.
The number of battle-ships, armored and
protected cruisers, remain as fixed in the
House bill. The Secretary of the Navy
is authorized to contract for armor for the :
ships provided for in the naval appropria- '
tion bill of IS9B at $400 a ton. â ,
Butler asked: "Will we conclude any
contracts for new war vessels under the I
pending bill if it becomes a law?"
Hale replied: "No, I think not. I be
lieve we shall do no more than get out
the plans and specifications for the au
thorized ships and decide about turrets
and the like. Of course, the Senate con
ferees had to yield something."
"But we seem to have yielded every
thing and the House nothing," said Till
man.
"The Senate conferees cannot settle
this controversy alone," said Hale.
"But the Senate can," responded Till
man. "We can place on the. House the
responsibility of an extra session. I was
never strongly tempted to say, 'This bill |
shall not pass and become a law, 1 but
have assurances from gentlemen on this â¢
side of the chamber"â waving his hand j
toward the Republican sideâ "that they ;
will help us out at the next session, and
I am willing to accept those assurances."
The conference report was finally agreed
to without division. This was the last of j
the conference agreements on the appro- j
priation bills to be acted on by the Senate,
and its acceptance caused a general sigh
of relief.
A recess until 10:30 o'clock was then or
dered.
At 10 o'clock President McKinley and his
entire Cabinet came to the President's
room in the Senate wing of the Capitol,
where the many bills which had been
passed were presented to the President"
for signature. He had little time to give I
consideration to the different measures.
The President signed all the appropria
tion bills, with the exception of the Dis
trict of Columbia. He signed the omnibus
claims bill. < HBSESK
When the Senate reconvened at 10:30
o'clock the Senate chamber had been
"spruced up," and appeared quite tidy.
The galleries were crowded. .
On motion of Mason, the printing of the I
testimony taken In the investigation of j
the Bureau of Engraving and Printing j
was ordered.
Fairbanks moved the consideration of
the bill extending the immigration laws
to the Hawaiian Islands. Pettus objected
on behalf of his colleague, Morgan. The
bill, however, was taken up,- and Petti
grew spoke upon it. He asserted that
since the annexation of the islands 10,000
Asiatic slave laborers had been imported. j
Perkins also urged action at the present I
session, declaring that the contract labor
ers in Hawaii were secured at one-third
the cost of labor to the sugar makers of
California or Louisiana. Without action
a motion by Morgan to go into executive
session was carried ayes 32, noes 22 â and
the crowded galleries were soon vacated
to permit the last executive work of the
Congress. .
At 11:45 o'clock the doors of the Senate
were opened and the Senate began the I
final legislative session of the present
Congress. â¢ -
Hoar reported that the committee had
waited on the President of the United !
States and had been instructed by him
that he had disposed of the public busi- i
ness which had been laid before him by
the two houses, and that he had no fur- :
ther communications to make; that the :
two houses had reached the end of a very
laborious and important session and that
he wished their members a safe return to '
their homes.
Vice President Hobart then addressed i
the Senate, at the close of which he de
clared the. Senate adjourned without day i
There was general handshaking amorii? >
the Senators, and numerous expressions
cf regret were heard that many whose
terms expired to-day were not to be here
when the Senate met again.' Preparations
were everywhere observed for departure
many Senators intending to leave for their
homes at once.

WASHINGTON, March 4.â With ref
| erence to his attempt to-day to secure
! recognition for the purpose of address
| ing the House, General Wheeler said
to-night:
"Seeing there was nothing to be done
in the House, I asked unanimous con
sent to speak for five minutes. I was
not recognized, but Mr. Payne was no
tified to move for a recess for five min
utes. I then asked that before that
motion was put I be permitted to ad
dress the House for three minutes. If
the Speaker had submitted my request
I am confident no member of the House
would have objected. What I intended
to say was as follows:
" 'No one reveres the constitution
more than myself and I could not be
induced to advocate a construction con
trary to the intent of its framers.
" 'When I received the appointment
as major general of volunteers last
May I was requested by persons whose
desires I could not disregard not to
resign my seat in Congress. I found
that during the present Congress
thirty-three of its members had been
appointed to offices and that none of
them had resigned their seats in Con
gress. I examined, the decisions and
precedents on the subject and found
that during the 110 years of the exist
ence of our Government hundreds and
possibly thousands of members of Con
gress had accepted offices during their
terms and that none of them holdine
temporary offices like mine had ever
been unseated. I found that the decis
ions of courts, even including four de
cisions quoted by General Henderson In
his report, took the ground that inhibi
tlons found in constitutions with regard
to officers referred to offices of a perma
nent character and not of a temporary
character. I also found that the At
torney General of the United States
had rendered an elaborate opinion on
the subject, in which he took precisely
the same pound and held that an office
in the volunteeni was not such an of
, flce^ as was inhibited by the constitul

HAD A DECIDEDLY
"DEATHLY SMELL"
Bad Quality of Both the RefriÂ£=
crated and Canned Stuff
Served to Troops.
WASHINGTON. March 4.â The War
Department Court of Inquiry wound up !
its week's work with a half day's
session to-day, having exhausted its
list of witnesses now on hand. There
may be some witnesses at the Monday
n. but the court will start for
Chicago early next week, probably on
Tuesday or Wednesday.
Just before the close of the session
to-day a volunteer witness presented
himself, but was not accepted. He wore
an army uniform and said his name
was Frank Rundas, late of the Third
Nebraska (Colonel W. J. Bryan's) Regi
ment, and that he had recently been
honorably discharged from the service
and was on his way home. His story
was in brief that he had served in the
company kitchen with his command in
Jacksonville, and that during a long
period when the men were living on
refrigerated beef there was so much
internal trouble among the men that
the issue of this was stopped.
At another time he got hold of some
refrigerator meat in the kitchen that
was of such a peculiar color that the
attention of the company officers was
called to it. The surgeon In charge ex
amined it, bo Rundas says, and re
marked that the meat was "all right,
but had been prepared ;â  Porto
Rico, and since it had been issued the
men had as well use it." The meat was
cooked, but all the men who ate it were
made sick. The inference drawn was
that this was some of the same Porto
that Dr. Daly had analyzed
and alleged to "be chemically treated.
Rundas said he was on his way homy,
but had stopped off in Washington to
offer this information to the court of
inquiry if it thought it worth hear
ing. He presented himself to Colonel
s, the recorder of the court, but
was told that he would not be wanted
as a wit r.
On being asked soon afterward
whether Rundas was to be called, or
why he had been rejected, Colonel
Davis said: "I know nothing about the
man. He has on a uniform, but that
Js no proof that he is a soldier or ever
has been. There are all sorts of cranks
and impostors who come up here and
want to t-stify. As to this man. if he
can identify himself and the court di
rects me to call him, I will do so."
The counsel for General Miles will In
' quire into the antecedents of this man,
and if he appears to be what he rep
ts he will be called,
mcl Gallagher, who was recalled
in answer to a question from Major
LÂ«=e as to whether he had issued canned
to the Cuban refugees because our
soldiers would not eat it, replied: "We
issued the canned beef to the Cubans
because they preferred io eat it and
the bacon to our men because they pre
ferred that. We were trying our best
to civ.- every one what they most pre
â 
"Umph," commented Major
Louis J>. Hunter of the Sixth Massa
chusetts and regimental commissary
while in Porto Rico, said his experience |
with both rh<- canned and refrig<
n the whole had been quite satis
... s me of the canned beef was
mned, but the percentage was
small. There had hpon considerable
at times, but on one
occasion the quantity had been cut
down on the advice of the Burgeon. The
men liked the native beef, whicTi was
v.-ll flavored, but very tough.
Lieutenant Hunter said the men ate
a larg*Â» amount of native fruit, and
bananas, raw or cooked, became almost
a staple article of food. Probably 2
per cent of the sickness was due to
fruit.
Cross-examined, witness said the m^n
dsd not use over 5 per cent of the
eef after reaching Porto Rico.
They traded the rest to the native
keepers. On the march he had
many mÂ«n throw away the beef
tifter making one meal out of th^ can.
of else give it to the natives. Witness
had been made sick, as he supposed,
: ting canned beef. His general
health was good.
Major George Ruthers of the com
missary department, who hai supplied
thÂ»- Seventh Army Corps with refriger
while at Jacksonville, said
hr- had never received a complaint.
The meat had been rigidly inspected
and showed no evidence of cuts or
puneturr-s or anything else that might
give rise to the suspicion that it had
been chemically treated. At Jackson
ville he had issued a general circular
to the Seventh Army Corps calling at
tention to the fact that beef or vege

BERLIN. March 4.â United States
EmbaHsadnr White says that "for some
time past there has been a tendency- on j
the part of the German Government to
be very conciliatory toward American
".commerce. In the first place, regard
ing American insurance companies,
which formerly were forbidden to do
business in Prussia, the Government
has conceded that the case, which was
Bupposed to be closed, may be reopened,
â¢and also, as the insurance companies
â¢ have been urging, it has sent repre
sentatives of Prussia to New York to
investigate the methods of American
companies. Whether these concerns
will be permitted to resume business
will depend on the nature of this re
port." 'â¢ -â -I '-'-/Lif- \

White added: "The meat inspection

even if the defect was not discovered
until the food reached the company
I camp.
Major I.cc took up the cross-examin
ation and developed the fact that there
had Been at times complaints as to tho
beef, and that in one case SOO pounds I
of beef had been condemned. Witness
said he had throe official complaints
! of the beef at Jacksonville.
"I understood you to say," said Ma
| jor Lee, "that you had never had a
Single complaint as to the refrigerator
â¢beef. If I am wrong I would like to
bo corrected.
"You are, sir," replied the witness.
"What I said was that I had handled
1,020,000 pounds of refrigerator beef at
Savannah without any complaint. The
complaints were made at Jackson
ville."
Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Guild of
Boston, who was attached to General
Fitzhugh Lee's staff as inspector gen
eral of the Seventh Army Corps, said
in opening that he had already been
before the War Investigating Commis
sion, and had two very careful reports
on the subject, one by order of In
spector General Breckinridge, both of
which w^re on file in the War Depart
ment. He submitted to the court that
these reports, being accurately com-
I ih il from official data, would be bet
ter evidence than he could give off
hand.
"We will, of course, call for your
official report to the War Department,"
said Colonel Davis. "But," he added,
very positively, "your testimony before
I the War Commission will, of course
I not he available for us."
Witness said his experience at Jack
sonville had been very satisfactory. I i * â 
! had personally inspected many cars,
tindinp very few sides of beef to the
whole of which any exception could be
i taken. Of the canned roast beef he
j had unofficial}- condemned 42,000
pounds, which had been transshipped
i from New Orleans before it was de-
I livered to the army in Jacksonville.
!He explained that a largv- shipment
â  of canned roast beef had arrived at
Jwcksonvlle in very offensive condition.
He had picked out offensive smelling
cases, amounting to 42,000 pounds, and

home office, and quickly received word
from his firm that it would be very
glad to take hack the whole shipment
and furnish good beef in its place. This
was done. The beef had been s^nt to
New Orleans by Major West, the com
i missary, but there was no stamp or
; other means on th^ packages to tell by
what army officer the beof had been
inspected and accepted. It was
stamped by the Birreau of Animal In
dustry.
Witness had subsequently made in
spections of Texas beef killed in Cubn
in the past few months, reports on
I which are on file in the War J>
'â â  ment. He had made chemical analy
ses and bacteriological examinations
of the canned roast beef used in Cuba,
and had made personal comparisons be
tu-(.cn refrigerator beef, native Cuban
cattle and Texas beef killed in Cuba
which had not been in cold storage.
His experiments had been exhaustive
I'and conducted as fairly as possible
i with reference to practical conditions.
i His own opinion was that th p best meat
our troops could get in the West Indies
was American cattle killed and refrig
erated in Cuba as near as possible to
the spot where it was to be used.
Quartermaster Sergeant Sullivan of
the Ninth Massachusetts had been
through the Santiago campaign and
came to the stand full of the memories
of canned and refrigerated beef. The
former, he said, the men barely tasted.
The latter he started in to describe as
a strange and grewsome article, unlike
i anything he had ever seen. He said it
had a "deathly smell." Here he col
lided with the recorder, who insisted on
having a strict definition of a "deathly
i smell." Witness got as far as saying
that the "deathly smell" was different
trom the smell of a decomposing body,
! but here the recorder demanded a state
ment of the mechanism of decomposi
tion and a list of the gases which would
'be evolved. The witness thereupon
went to pieces and reduced the whole
statement to saying that "thf href was
f very bad," and on this he refused to
be shaken.
The witness list, having been cx
i hausted the court adjourned until 10
o'clock Monday.
to American interests, showing good
will toward the United States. The
essions regarding oranges, raisins
and dried fruits and the passing of
thorn in bond without inspection is also
of great value, and the indications are
favorable for a fair settlement of other
issues.
"The Germans, " continued Mr. White,
"claim that it is now the turn of the
Americans to make concessions such as
the release of their ships from the ton
nage dues imposed under the adminis
tration of President Cleveland, and
since continued under a misapprehen
sion. There are also many other signs
that the Germans desire the widest fa
cilities for business with the Ameri
cans, an example being the especially
favorable report of the Hamburg
Chamber of Commerce in regard to
American trade. All this seems to mi
i dlcate that opinion is tending in a re
j markable degree in favor of equitable
' treatment of American products. This
doubtless will have marked effect on
the commerce of the two nations."
The report of the Chamber of Com
merce of Hamburg referred to by Mr.
White is a highly interesting and re
markable document. It reviews briefly.
but completely, the relations between
Germany and the United States during
the past year, and says there is no
doubt the Dingley tariff has been a
great benefit to many articles made in
the United States. It is further as
serted that the reason for the strength
of American industry is found in 'the
fact of the capacity for production on
a large scale of certain commodities in
I comparison with which the German fa
i cilities, with only a few exceptions, are
! far inferior. European industry, it is
added, may be prepared for the fact
that in many articles which have hith
erto been imported the United States
will become sharp competitor?, espe
cially in the iron and steel industries.
Concerning meats, the report says:
"Much wrongdoing has been committed
in the German customs during the past
and, in fact, there have been many
cases of trichinosis after consuming
home pork which had been duly in
spected and certified as sound, which
proved that the inspection is a doubt
ful sanitary benefit."
The report further says the San Jose
scale scare was exaggerated and that
much damage was thereby done to the
trade, adding that, it is singular no
German Consul in America has drawn
attention to the matter.

MUNICIPAL ECONOMY.
THE dollar limit on local taxation was discussed i
before the Street Committee of the Supervisors
on Thursday in an informal manner, but several
points were developed which are somewhat interest-
Supervisor Perrault said that if the limit were
reed this year the amount raised by taxation
would not meet the ordinary' expenses of the muni
cipal government, let alone paying for the improve
ments for which petitions have been filed to the num
t seventy-three by improvement clubs and prop
erty-owners in different portions of the city. A. S.
Lii'iie of the Mission Federation of Improvement
Clubs replied to Dr. Perrault by saying that if
economy were exercised in the management of the
local government a tax levy of $i on the $100 of
valuation would be sufficient to conduct the city and
Lde for all needed improvements.
Both gentlemen are right and yet wrong. Under
the present law the local government cannot be con
ducted economically. Eighty per cent of its appro
priations are fixed by law, and the Supervisors could
not change them if they would. The other 20 per
cent may be cut down.. The important department,
for which a reasonable appropriation is demanded,
js the Street Department, where the bulk of the
money is needed. The appropriation for this depart
ment is flexible. Salaries of deputies and the expen
â : s of most of the executive departments are fixed
by law. and if an appropriation is not made for them
they may draw the money from the treasury anyhow.
Supervisor Perrault is entirely correct in saying
that the city government cannot be conducted for $1
on the $100 and the improvements petitioned for car
ried out. The Supervisors have attempted during
several years past to make necessary repairs on worn
out public buildings and dilapidated public streets,
with the only result of producing a deficit in the
treasury. Deficits have now become a regular thing,
and it does not appear possible to avoid them under
the present system. If a sufficient amount of money
is not included in the tax levy to be imposed this year
c improvements asked for by the improvement
ciubs will have to be postponed. In other words, if
the Supervisors arc going to conduct the government i
foi Si. they. cannot do more than meet necessary cur
rent expenses.
Doubtless the municipality can and ought to be
run on a tax levy of $1 on the $100, but the experience
of several years has proved that this is impossible un
der the present law. Under the new charter it may
be feasible to make a change in the system. If it is,
it certainly ought to be done.
By the amount of pipe being sent to Manila it may
be judged that that town will have a sewer system
long before San Francisco shall have progressed to
the point of draining itself. Then we can send com
missioners to the Philippines and find how to put
sanitary methods into operation.
Milton Green is not anxious to answer any ques
tions at the bar of the Assembly, and there do not
seem to be many who are anxious to ask the ques
tions, anyhow. Probably the date set for the Green
matinee might as well be canceled.
The latest revolution in Costa Rica orrfy lasted
thirty minute?. Heretofore a revolution there was ex
pected to endure at least for a day. The new plan,
however, gives an opportunity for several of the
events between sunrise and sunset.
The bicycle rider's idea that he is always right and
thus constantly at liberty to go ahead has resulted
in at least one death recently. However, this will not
lesson the prevalence of the idea among surviving
wheelers.
Spain has never in all her shameful history done
anything so idiotic as the present course of putting
the gallant Montojo in jail for the offense of having
fought bravely and been honorably licked.
A Coroner's jury has censured the FJectric Light
Company for so disposing of its iive wires as to kill
a man, but the company is not reported to be suffer
ing greatly. _
There is a report from Manila that Aguinaldo
wants $7,000,000 for the release of Spanish prisoners,
but as. Creclman confirms the report, it is probably
untrue. .
The State quarantine service will never be missed
save by the officials it has supported and the private |
citizens it has annoyed.
THE BURNS PRONUNCIAMENTO.
THE Burns Junta at Sacramento, borrowing a
custom from Mexico, has issued its Pronun
ciamento. In this document the party is lec
tured upon its duty and the will of the majority is
lauded as the only rule of action. The statement is
! put in this precise form: "This country has a rep
-1 rcsentative government; all selections of officials are
; decided by a vote of the persons entitled to act
! thereon, and the selection of a majority, no matter'
j how small numerically, becomes, by the force of law,
! the selection of all. This law of the land has become
by usage the law of political parties."
Very well. The persons entitled to act in the Leg
islature, representing the Republican party and
charged with the function of electing a Senator, have
been acting according to the law of the land for the
last eight weeks. The majority of the "persons en
titled to act" have every day during that time acted.
A majority decides affirmatively and negatively at
once. Every day of the session the majority has de
cided against Burns. On no ballot taken has he had
even a plurality of the votes cast. On no ballot has he
had the highest number of votes cast for any candi
date. Up to the day his Junta assumed to instruct
the party on the sacrosanct nature of a majority "the
persons entitled to act" for the seventieth time acted
and cast against him an overwhelming majority.
For the seventieth time "the persons entitled to act"
cast against him more than a two-thirds majority.
For the seventieth time the majority of over two
| thirds declared that Colonel Burns was not the choice
| of the party nor of "the persons entitled to act."
Now, the Junta's Pronunciamento continues and
! says: "The selection of a majority, no matter how
! small numerically, becomes by force of law the selec
j tion of all." Therefore the rejection by a majority,
no matter how small numerically, becomes by the force
of law the rejection of all. Colonel Burns, having been
: seventy times rejected by a majority of two-thirds,
i should, according to the reasoning of his Junta, step
j aside. His minority of less than one-third should re
spect the will of the majority and cease to oppose that
will. Its refusal to obey the will of the majority is
\ likely to lead to disastrous and wide-reaching results,
I for the Burns Junta says in its Pronunciamento: "It
i i ; absolutely necessary to the preservation of a politi
cal party that this law (submission to the majority)
! should govern the deliberations of its members, for
I without it a party becomes a mere mob, without co
' hesive power, a rope of sand only powerful to injure
itself." The majority, having decided that it does not
want Burns for Senator, his contumacious resistance
of that decision, according to his own Junta, is likely
; to turn the party into a mob capable of injuring only
itself. Surely there can be no stronger reason given
for his immediate obedience to the will of the more
than two-thirds majority seventy times cast against
him. Majorities act by natural instinct, first against
the point of greatest danger, and then toward the
point of greatest safety. Instinctively the majority
has seventy times acted against the candidacy of
Burns. Seventy times he has returned to the attack
and thereby has compelled continuance of the resist
ance. Let him obey the principles laid down by his
own Junta, let him bow to the majority, and then that
majority, no longer compelled to defend itself against
his assault, no longer compelled to protect the party
against his rebellious refusal to obey the majority,
will address itself to the duty of electing a Senator and
can do it on one ballot.
This is the first time in the history of parties that a
rebellious minority, seventy times outvoted, seventy
times rejected, seventy times defeated, seventy times
refusing to obey the will and law of the majority, has
had the presumption to accuse that majority of being
in rebellion against the minority!
The Junta's Pronunciamento amounts to just that.
It is a distinct insult to .the majority. The
two-thirds and more of the Republican mem
bers of the Legislature have stood with
unbroken front against Burns. Incidentally they
have cast their votes for other candidates, all of whom
have avowed themselves ready to get out of the way
as soon as the defensive campaign against the re
bellious minority is over and let the majority combine
on a proper candidate. It is only Burns, the seventy
times rejected aspirant, who refuses to release the
majority from its defensive duty and permit its affir
mative action.
So much for this self-condemning Pronunciamento
of the Burns Junta. There is left of it merely the
pretense that the will of the majority is operative only
through a caucus. That pretense has been disposed of
nlready. The majority has expressed its will seventy
times, in the way provided by the laws of the United
States and of the State, and Burns, having seventy
times refused to obey it, cannot be permitted to dic
tate the terms on which he will obey it.
THE SUPREME COURT flGfllN.
ON January 10, 1899, Senator Dickinson intro
duced a bill covering proposed amendments
to the State constitution and designed for the
relief of the congestion in the Supreme Court. The
bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee of the
Senate, which has now reported a substitute bill to
which every objection already stated by The Call to
the creation of three new courts of appeal is dis
tinctly applicable. To the matter of expense we have
already adverted. This objection would probably de
feat the proposed amendments at the polls. But there
are other reasons against their submission to the peo
ple. The effect of their adoption,. if our views are
correct, would be to defeat their avowed object by in
creasing the labors of the Supreme Court, deprived
of two of its members, and establishing three tribunals
that would be practically sinecures. We have no
doubt that the existing Justices would be glad to ex
change their present offices for the new positions the
Senate Judiciary Committee proposes to create. The
direct appeals authorized by these amendments from
the Supreme Court embrace constitutional questions,
State and Federal, taxation and assessments, eminent
domain, proceedings for usurpation of or intrusion
into publrc franchises, certain municipal controver
sies, and criminal cases where death or imprison
ment for life is involved. In addition to this formid
able array, in every case where the decision of a court
of appeals conflicts with a decision of the Supreme
Court or of another court of appeals it is to be heard
in the Supreme Court. A singular feature in the text
of this part of the amendments is that it seems to re
quire a decision in advance of a transfer. The Su
preme Court itself, moreover, is invested with "dis
cretion" to order any case decided in the courts of
appeal to be heard before itself, and the applications
under this head alone would probably occupy a large
part of the time of five Justices.
Under this plan we suggest that confusion would be
worse confounded, and that, while nine judgeships
would be available to the numerous candidates for
such offices, with the certainty that they would not be
overworked, the burthen thrown upon the Supreme
bench, already overweighted, would be simply in
tolerable. Whatever new jurisdiction is created
should be final, within its own limits, to which it
should be rigidiy held. One court of appeals, of three

situation, and would be satisfactory to the people un
til the time comes, as is inevitable, when our entire
judicial system and methods of administering the law
shall be remodeled.
A FiN DE SIECLE EXPOSITION
SOME high and mighty ladies of London have
devised for the entertainment of that city during
the last year of the century a scheme suffi
ciently novel and attractive to be worthy of Parisian
brains. They propose to open a grand international
exposition of woman's work and her caprices in all
lands, in all ages and of all kinds.
The promoters and patrons of the movement are
dames of high degree and wide renown. The honor
ary committee, as given in a recent number of the
London Chronicle, includes the Duchess of Devon
shire, the Duchess of Marlborough, the Duchess of
Sutherland, the Marchioness of Twceddale, the Mar
chioness of Zetland, Lady Cowper, Lady Warwick
and Lady Cadogan, and it is further announced that
the gifted and smart Miss Tessa Mackenzie acts as
secretary. From that list judge the rest. The whole
array of titles and names is more suggestive of a
grand ball than an exposition, but that is the charm
of the enterprise. It is to be fin de siecle. It is to
show that the dames of fashion in these days can
manage entertainments larger than masquerades and
more exciting than high teas.
The scope of the exposition is to be universal so
far as women are concerned. Particular attention is
to be given to the historical section, which is to in
clude relics, works and pictures of famous women,
and a vast hall is to be given up to an exhibition of
feminine dress, fashion and adornment in all nations
and from the earliest ages. It appears that for these
features of the exhibit there are to be no temporary
structures erected, but that some of the stately his
toric buildings of the city are to be used. Thus the
Chronicle announces the display of dress and orna
ment is to be made in the Ducal Hall, and the his
torical exhibits are to be in the Royal Galleries.
While the management of the enterprise is at pres
ent in the hands of the noble coterie described, it is
intended to make it thoroughly democratic as soon
as the movement is fairly launched. It is not to be
an affair of the Four Hundred. The Duchesses are
not afraid they will lose prestige by associating with
working women, and propose to invite the co
operation of women of every part of the globe. Men,
however, are to be rigidly excluded, not only from
the management, but even from the service of the
exposition as far as possible, as the prospectus an
nounces that in every department women are to be
employed wherever the work is of a kind that women
can do.
The novelties proposed for the exhibit are numer
ous. They include a children's fairyland, a nurses'
department, a picturesque home and a realistic hall.
The latter is suggestive. What manner of exhibit the
combined women of the world will make in a realis
tic hall is a question calculated to excite the curiosity
of even the dullest minded man that ever lived. For
the answer we shall have to wait until the exposi
tion opens. In the meantime it is just as well to take
note of the fact that London does not propose to
let Paris have all the crowd in the closing year of the
century, and the Woman's Exhibition is not going
to be a sideshow to the World's Fair in the French
capital, but a great moral circus and family amuse
ment of itseH.
fIN ABERRATION OF ENTHUSIASM.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the New York Mail
and Express, -admires the President's speech at
Boston, and so, indeed, do most people in the
country; but the admiration of our contemporary
reaches the degree of an aberration of the intellect
and has led it to give to the youth of the nation some
counsel far below the level of the normal horse
sense advice usually given by newspapers to aspiring
young men. â¢
Full of the enthusiasm generated by the President's
address, the Mail and Express actually advises young
men to take to oratory for a living. With something
like a dithyrambic fecundity of utterance it ex
claims:
"It is said all the stores are full, and fathers even
pay for the privilege of placing a son behind the
counter. It is said even the new profession of elec
ticity has become hopelessly overcrowded. 'What
sli.iil we do with our boys?' has long been a hard
question in good English families. It has not of late
been a simple one here. But there are other callings
than the commercial. There are other rewards than
riches. To speak well. It must be, as we take it, an ex
quisite joy to the speaker himself to nobly sway for
noble ends great audiences of his fellow-men, and
there are so many causes now for which one might
expect God's blessing on his tongue."
Ai all that one is tempted to exclaim, like Hamlet
to the ghost, "Art thou there, old truepenny?" The
counsel is most excellently well uttered, but yet it
will fare ill with the young man who turn* from com
merce and electricity to achieve fortune by speaking
well and invoking ?. divine blessing on his tongue.
The oratorical professions are about as overcrowded
as any other vocations, and while most of these elo
quent talkers receive "other rewards than riches," the
rewards do not pay the tailor, the landlord, the
grocer, the laundry, nor even the bar bill.
Let all who will cultivate oratory and feel the ex
quisite joy of nobly swaying to noble ends large au
diences of their fellowmen, but let no young man take
to it as a means of earning a living, or he may have
to lend his tongue to strange causes and the money
grubber will use him, and when all is said and done it
is doubtful if God will bless him even if he hires a
hall.
The gentleman who had the thoughtlessness to ob
serve worms in the meat furnished the soldiers in
Cuba, and the further thoughtlessness to mention the
fact, evidently failed to realize the scope of the in
quiiy. The purpose is to find, not that the meat was
wormy, but that it was a first-class article, at the re
ceipt of which the soldier was in duty bound to render
up his soul in thanks.
Some of the colored residents of Cuba have de
cided to work no more, but rely upon the generosity
of Uncle Sam for enough to eat. We prophesy a
change of heart or a touch of famine.
A Board of Inquiry with a fixed purpose not to in
quire if the answer is likely to be displeasing will
reach adjournment ultimately, but nothing else of im
portance.
Dewey refuses to write for publication, whereat the
belief that the Admiral is a great and good man takes
even firmer hold upon the people.
The Legislature will pass comparatively few bills,
but it cannot be deprived of credit for its failure to
pass a lot which were introduced.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
In New York a woman has been con
demned to electrocution. I have no
idea the sentence will be carried out,
and hope it will not be. Even to be
lievers in capital punishment there is
something- unspeakably repulsive in the
idea of visiting upon a female murderer
the extreme wrath of the law. In the
first place, women do not need to be
held in check as men do. Without of
ficial statistics at hand, I venture the
assertion that a thousand wanton mur
ders are committed by men to a soli
tary one by .women. In the second
place, no â woman falls so low that she
does not seem to masculine human
judgment to merit more consideration
than a member of the sterner sex. . It
is a phase of the same feeling that
causes a gentleman to yield his seat
in a street car to a lady, although he
may be tired and have no reason to
think her leg-weary. The position is
perhaps not one to be upheld logically,
but belief in the principle is deeply im
planted.

The Rev. Frederick C. Lee of the Cal
ifornia M. E. Church preached last
Sunday a strong and practical sermon,
in which he paid attention to the mem
ber of society known as a criminal law
yer. It is a pleasure to agree with
what he says (concerning this person. I
do not think that a lawyer who takes
the case of an assassin whom he knows
to be guilty, and endeavors to clear
him by keeping out evidence, by abus
ing witnesses or twisting the law, is
one whit better than the assassin; but
I do think the pair should be hanged on
the same scaffold.

My good friend, Edward Cahill, a
Frenchman, as his name implies, has
been indulging in mixed metaphors. He
was inspired by the circumstance that
a babe had been ordered out of court,
charged with being a disturber of jus
tice. He, as the proprietor of a lot of
babes, objects. He wants to know if
the ordinary babe is calculated to make
justice slip a cog. There is no answer
to this, as no parents ever yet have
confessed to the possession of an ordi
nary baby. Then he wants to know if
Justice sits so unsteady on her throne
that the hand of a child may upset her
ballast. I cannot conceive of Justice
slipping a cog and then sitting on a
throne and having her ballast upset.
If all these things happen to Justice she
will be in a bad way.

Mrs. Dora Fuhrig seems to possess
many, of the essential elements of a
pestilence. There have been charged
against her lately the deaths of four
women, and urged on by his grief, the
husband of one of these victims has
taken his own life. Mrs. Fuhrig can
with propriety add him to her list of
triumphs. Just why offenders of the
Fuhrig type should be arrested is not
clear, â¢ however. The process is never
more than an idle and expensive for
mality. To be suro, they ought to be
sent to prison for life, but to be sure,
they never are. On the contrary, they '
have no more need to be afraid of the
courts than has Piggott, the pocket
picking scoundrel, to whom arrest is
merely a Joke.

Expert evidence given by doctors ig
a weariness. When a physician of ex
perience views the wounds on a dead
body, and swears their result must
have been of a certain specific charac
ter, which he minutely describes, thÂ»?
layman, naturally thinks the doctor
knows what he is talking about. Where
the mystery comes in is at the advent
.of the doctor swearing for the oth^r
side, and who from the same Bet of
facts deduces conclusions exactly con.
trary to those already pointed out. It
is impossible to avoid one of two be
liefs, neither of them to be entertained
with pleasure. One is that doctors are
painfully ignorant, and the other, that
there are members of the profession
willing to perjure themselves for hire.
This, has been demonstrated anew in
the Brandes murder trial, which from
the first has been conducted in a fash
ion reflecting no credit on the lawyers
for the defense. One set of experts is
certain that the child, Lillian Brandos,
died from the impact of blows on the
head, and that her body was subjected
to post-mortem hanging, none of the
visible effects produced by strangula
tion having been present. Another set
declares that the child hanged herself,
.and the bruises on her, head were not
caused by blows which in themselves
could have had serious effect. A third,
with rare intelligence, ascribes the unÂ»
happy girl's taking off to pneumonia.
This last theory has peculiar features.
If she was a victim of this malady, did
she hang herself before or after? Had
death been due to natural causes, on
what hypothesis would any one have
subjected the little corpse to the indig
nity of suspension? As to the guilt of
the father, I hold an opinion which,
while the trial is in progress, there
would be perhaps indelicacy in express
ing. However, I do not believe that a
frail and suffering child often turns to
suicide for ; relief, nor that having died
from any cause, retains the ability or
desire to create a mystery by simulat
ing self-destruction. Supposing that
Lillian died of pneumonia and was
afterward discovered apparently stran
gled by suspension from the bedpost, it
is clear that the wretch who performed
this ghastly office thought himself or
herself the author of murder, and was
trying to hide the evidence. But com
ing back to. the subject' of experts,
there are , honest and able ones of
course. The difficulty is in selecting the
fools and liars and judiciously throwing
out their deceptive babble. >&?â¢.'

That Kipling is recovering is a cause
for gratitude. The race could ill spare
him. To say that the Anglo-Saxon

other individual sustain so great a loss
is merely to express a sentiment that

of which Kipling is master and magi

the genius of our age. Every genera
tion brings forth bright men, men or
talent and learning, who command re
spect and even veneration. Only the
centuries produce a genius. Christ was
one of these, a magnifi cent personality
who spoke with inspired wisdom, and
whose matchless teachings form the
safest, noblest guide to human conduct.
Shakespeare was a genius, writing as
though he drew upon the fount of ab
solute knowledge, inscribing imperisha- ;
ble lines, appalling mankind by the |
profundity of his intuitive learning. ,
Such men are not to be understood.
We merely accept them, thank God for
them, and wonder. Philosophy cannot
explain a Kipling. He is, and that is
all we know. His grasp of life is be
yond ordinary ken. The charm of his
pen enthralls. He builds a poem, and
the world beats time to its cadence.
He tells a story, and entranced we
watch the portrayal of emotions which
had thrilled us, but which we could not
define; of desire, aspiration, love, pat
riotism. He exalts the commonplace or
from the sublime strips the glamour.
He tells of the sea, and we hear the
beating of surf on a distant shore. He
tells of ships, and we listen to the throb
of thc-ir mighty engines, while the foam
flying from 'their prows as they cleave
the waves smites the very brow. He
tells of war, and the din of battle awes
us, the groans of the wounded break
the after silence, and before us there
spreads in fascinating horror a vision
of the dead. He tells of the beasts of
the junglo, and we perceive that the
secrets of the forest have been revealed
to him. He carries us from the tropics
to the northern floes, and we go with |
him content. Kipling towers above his
literary fellows a splendid giant. His
work has a mystic, marvelous touch
no other intellect now framed in mortal
clay can give, and the reader is aware
that through the august phrases of a
modern writer the Infinite is finding ex
pression.

The Rev. Charles Locke, for whom I
entertain a deep respect, says that a
Sunday law is necessary. Yet the peo
ple to whom he preaches would under
such a law have only the freedom to
worship that is already theirs, while
people outside the narrow world of
creed would not pay to such a law the
slightest attention. The reverend gen
tleman can sustain his position only
on the hypothesis that everybody
among the upright occupies the same
point of view as that from which he
studies the universe. Were this tru<:,

Captain John McCafferty has written
several columns about the situation at
Manila. Concerning this article there
are two strange things. One is that
any paper should have given it space,
and another, that anybody should have
read it, as I must confess having done.
The article possesses no value, unless
as a symptom of dyspepsia, and to be
regarded with interest from a medical
standpoint. I judge that the captain
while in the Philippines told the men
in authority how to run things, and
that they failed to be impressed.

It is a shameful and sorry rirctim
stance that scandal should have come
out of the war with Spain, and that it
should have touched both the army and
navy. As to the army, there is a charge
that soldiers were fed on rotten meat.
The charge was brought by Major Gen
eral Miles. There is not the slightest
reason for believing he would have
brought it had he not been certain it
was true. He had nothing to gain by
making false accusations, but much to
lose. He had, save the respect of his
countrymen, nothing to gain by laying
bare the truth. The investigation which
has resulted has been from the first a
farce and a sham, directed not to the
ascertaining of facts, but to an effort
to besmirch Miles and protect his of
ficial superior and a lot of rascally con
tractors for whom hanging would be
too good. Since Miles has been tra
duced and belittled, it would be a fit
ting recompense were he to see the Sec
retary of War turned from office, and
there being no politics in this column, I
do not hesitate to say this is what the
Secretary deserves. During the Civil
War he was never a good soldier, an
unpalatable verity known to Milas, and j
in political life he has not been spot
less. As to the navy, Sampson and the
people behind him have so clearly been
trying to job Schley that Sampson
ought never to have been advanced an
other peg. He had been advanced sud
denly once over the heads of better
men, and he showed his appreciation by
trying to discredit those who calmly
submitted to the injustice and faith
fully strove to Perform their duties.
Sampson has been spoiled, and his
goody-good friend Long also causes
that tired feeling. Neither one could
pay a finer tribute to the exigencies of
the occasion than by resigning.

The police are being blamed for a
lack of effort to rescue a woman who
had attempted suicide by fyrning on !
the gas. I do not blame them in the
least. For my part I would consider
it a presumption to so much as turn
over my hand to prolong the life of
one who was anxious to die, unless
that person were near to me, and I
had reason to believe that to her or
him life would be sweeter than deatn.
I do not advocate suicide. It is tha
refuge of the coward, but when one haa j
striven vainly and long, and failed; j
when the best that nature bestowed ;
has been exerted without reward; when i
the future holds no promise and ths I
past is a procession of haunting regrets, j
I do not censure one who snuffs out
the candle, nor question the right to
venture a new existence for the exist
ence which has been a disappointment.
There are theories about life having
been divinely bestowed, and. so a sa
cred thing, but they do not appeal to
me. The majority of human beings
come into the world unwelcome. Ex
perience teaches them that they are
superfluous. They must fight or fall,
and the benign power which gave them
breath did not eflulp them for fighting.
There is no kindness in keeping in thÂ«
world one who has grown weary of It,
and each must be judge in his own

One result of the conference held In this

point has many natural advantages for
the object intended, as it is on the open,

ly up to the warehouses. The elevation of
the point is such that grain-laden cars
may have their freight discharged by
gravity into the holds of the ships.
No plans have as yet been devised in
regard to the proposed improvement, but
contracts have been let for the removal of,
nearly 3W.000 cubic yards of earth from'
the hills to he used aa a foundation for
future ferry buildings. The contract was
let to Poley Bros. & Muir, who have sub
let it to James McMahon. A camp has
been established on the top of the point,
and forty men have been put to work.

MADE FOES OF

PROTESTS HIS INNOCENCE
DID NOT AID IU THE SAN
QTJENTIN PLOT.
{The Disgraced Official Says He Was
Ousted on the Word of Crim
inals Whom He Had
Disciplined.
SpÂ«clal Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
(R7ISUN, March 4.â James F. Shield?,
who was discharged from his position
as guard at San Quentin and against
whom serious charges were made by
Convict Cooper, implicating him in the
smuggling: of firearms to eight convicts
wjio had plotted to escape, denied the
allegation to-day. He also denied the
accusations connecting him with the
emuggling of opium.
"The 'dope' story," said Shields,
â¢ "was the result of malice on the part
of a Russian convict named Decker,
who had threatened to do me up."
Shields says he observed a convict
named Jackson throw a knife into a
pit. He called his partner's attention
to it. They went to the pit and found
the knife. Decker interfered with the
guards and was struck across the head
with a cane. The convict vowed venge
ance and later started the opium
â¢tory respecting Shields. Warden Hale
â aid he could not take the convict's
word. Shields, however, was- removed
from the mill and given a position as
second night watchman.
Coming to the second accusation,
Shields said:
"I went to bed at ten minutes past
5 on thp night the supposed plot was
to be carried out. I remained there un
til the call to go to work. At the gate
I was accosted by Warden Hale, Cap
tain Edgar and Captain Birlem. On
getting inside Hale asked me to go to
his office, where he Informed me Con
vict Cooper had implicated me in the
taking of firearms . to the convicts,
cooper said I had taken some pistols
and cartridges on Wednesday evening
and that I had more on my person that
night. I denied the statement and
asked Hale to search me. Later Cap
tain Birlem and Frank Arbogast came
in and together they searched me. and
+ verything in my room, finding nothing
.. hatever to corroborate Cooper's blase
ness and lying story."

tilla of incriminating evidence against
him and will demand an investigation

TO CREATE OFFICES
Proposed County Government Act Is
Denounced by Citizens of
Santa Clara.
SAN JOSE, March 4.â The new county
govf-rnment act now pending before the
State Legislature is the most unpopular
measure ever introduced for the supposed
benefit of the residents of Santa Clara
Valley. At the meeting of the Farmers'
Club this afternoon it was denounced as
a vicious measure Intended only to fleece
the taxpayers and make fat places for
politicians. Its adoption means an addi
tional expense of $40,000 to $50,000 a year
in the running of the county.
The following resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
"Resolved, By the Santa Clara County
Farmers' Club that whereas certain
vicious legislation is proposed under the
county government act affecting the most

.tiich we regard as an attempt to rob
Se taxpayers of many thousands of dol
.ars a year in the appointment of a lot
of unnecessary officers and a removal of
the safeguards surrounding the letting of
contracts; and
"Whereas, The attempted robbery is
being tried under cover of an omnibus
act affecting the whole State, but par

fourth class, of which Santa Clara is the
only one; and
"Whereas. Said measure has passed the
lower house of the Legislature; be it

mento to fight the measure. Morehouse is

PURSUE A THIEF
Encompass the Capture of the Cul
prit After an Extended
Chase.
SANTA CRUZ, March 4.â Pedestrians
on a street in the residence portion of the
city were this afternoon treated to the
spectacle of a burglar being pursued by
five young women, who eventually en
compassed his capture. The fellow at
tempted to enter A. Jennings' residence,
anoSwas detected by a young woman liv
ing in an adjoining house. She hastened
to give the alarm, but the only persons
she could find were four others of her
sex. The five pluckily started out to cap
ture the burglar. As they approached the
culprit took to his heels, and they fol
lowed at the top of their speed. After a
couple of blocks had been traversed the
burglar, in turning a corner, ran plump
into the arms of two men, who grappled
with him and held him. He was turned
over to a policeman, who landed him in
the city prison. \Vh<n the fellow was
searched there was found in his possession
a number of skeleton keys and tools used
in his profession.

THE SA!N" FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1899.
EXPANSION AND THE CONSTITUTION.
i I To the Editor of the San Francisco
j Call: Tour correspondent, Henry
James, in The Call of last Sunday, dis
putes the soundness of my opposition
1I to expansion in Asia, May I trespass
> on your space to the extent of a reply?
Mr. James does not contend that the
acquisition of the Philippines, either as
! a colony or as national territory, is
within the terms or the implications of
! the Federal constitution. Following the
! lead of Sir Boyle Roche in the Irish
; Parliament, in reference^o the unwrit
i ten British constitution, Tie recognizes
! the conflict but coolly brushes the en
tire instrument aside. "The constitu
tion," he tells us, "wafi formed under
stress of circumstances which have
passed away, to meet the requirements
iof people who have long been dust.
Wise and glorious as the document is
; I do not see how it could at that time
I have been so contrived as to fill the
! needs of generations then unborn â to
f^eal with situations of which no states
: man had the remotest dream." If this
I be true then the constitution has been
I "outgrown," and it would be interesting
; to ascertain under what form of gov
| ernment we live. The preamble says
that the constitution is ordained and
i established, among other things, "to
| secure the blessings of liberty to our
: selves and our posterity." For one hun
! dred and twelve years the American
! people have supposed that our Federal
| Government was a constitutional re
â  public. The Civil War was waged upon
, the theory that the "more perfect
j union" established by the constitution
could not be disrupted at the will of
one or more of the States, and that se
! cession had no legal justification.
The first official act of this Govern
i ment, of which I am aware, that not
I only disregarded the terms of the con
| stitution but the Declaration of Inde
pendence was the acceptance of the
claim of Spain to the Philippines, after
she had been dispossessed, as vesting
title in the United States and transfer
ring to us the allegiance of the Fllipi
j nos, the natives, and in the substantial
j occupation of the country. During our
I Revolutionary War the rights of the in
habitants of the thirteen colonies to
i government by their own consent, to
i the correlatives of taxation and repre
| sentation, and to the enjoyment of "life,
I liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"
in their own way, were not only main
! tamed by themselves on the land and
I on the sea, but, in the face of King
| George and his ministry, with Lord
North as Premier, were proclaimed in
i the British Parliament by Chatham and
' by Burke, whose devotion to liberty has
i been wrought into the American mind
I by our common schools and celebrated
; on Independence Day in every State and
Territory of the Union. These are the
rights that were entrenched in the Fed
' eral constitution and the solecism of
acknowledging them as "inherent" in
the whites and yet denying them to the
blacks was the real cause of the blood
-1 iest internal struggle that ever con
j vulsed a nation. When that struggle
' ended, with the preservation of the
Union under the constitution, now hap
pily cemented by the concurrence of
! the whole people, it was our proudest
! boast that in this continental republic
freedom, equality before the law and
the representative principle existed in
â  absolute uniformity, and that wherever
i the constitution extended and the flag
waved the sovereignty of man, without
"^distinction of color or race, was an ac
complished and an unalterable fact.
The miserable pretense of som,e illogical
expansionists that holding within the
Union our fellow citizens of the South
against their temporary will is a pre
i cedent for the coercion of ten millions
of alien Filipinos into the acceptance j
of our control is the use of a false an
alogy that any school boy can expose
' and could be employed to justify the
'â  arbitrary enforcement of our rule upon
\ every community, civilized and barbar
i ous upon the face of the globe. bo
monstrous a doctrine would convert our
Government into the freebooter of na
! tions and would establish a tyranny,
I reÂ«ting on militarism, more intolerable
than any despotism that history has
condemned. ,
Under our constitution the develop
ment of the United States, most effect
ually proved by the statistics of 1898.
has surpassed all the achievements ot
the past. And yet this is the instru
ment that Mr. James declares to have
been "formed under the stress of cir
cumstances" and to be impotent "to
me^t the needs of generations then un
born," or "to deal with situations, for
example, such as the short war with
Spain has produced. Like all other ex
pansionists of the present imperialistic
or Asiatic annexation type, Mr. James
fails to perceive the distinction between
immutable principles and varying con
ditions. The moral law is not a penal
code, but it has remained the same
since the days of Moses. The Ameri
can constitution is not a legislative^ Ni
cest but a grant of power adapted to
the combined necessities of a nation
and resting upon fixed principles that
are as eternal as the soul of man. If
thp Declaration of Independence was
not a tissue of falsehoods it applies as
Inexorably to the Filipinos in Asia as
it did to the colonists in America. If
King George had no right to bombard
the heroes of the Revolution into sub
mission to his arbitrary authority then
we have no right to dominate the Fili
pinos by shot and by shell. Indeed
the attitude of King George was more
plausible than our own, because the
thirteen colonies sprang from British
stock and had been for generations
under the dominion of the British
crown whereas the Filipinos are alien
to us in race, in history and in govern
ment, and the only pretext we have for
the acquisition of the Philippines is
that we purchased them from Spain,
against whose authority, in exatt cor
respondence with our own political
theory, the Filipinos had persistently
rebelled. If the expansionists are right
the founders of this republic w-ere
wrong and our constitutional system"
should be replaced by British expedi
ency that protects liberty at home and
administers imperialism abroad.
But if it be true that our constitution
Is too circumscribed for the conditions
with which we are now confronted
then it would seem that it must be
formally repudiated. We are not in a
state of anarchy, and while our present
government lasts, as it has no legal
existence except under the constitution,
that national charter must be respected.
Tt Drovldes a mode of amendment, but
it does not provide for its own destruc
tion, and as it is legally operative over
every foot of soil that belongs to the
United States and as it embraces no
powers that are not expressed or neces
Â«arilv implied, then, short or long, ter
n! nora'rv or durable, unless it confers
some 'authority for Asiatic extension
the retention and administration of the
Philippines would be a sheer usurpa
i tion The dilemmas in which the Amer-
i can people would be entangled by the
i fluctuating demands of the expansion
ists are so numerous and so intricate
' that they will have either to be cut by
! the sword of imperialism or settled by
â¢ the strong arm of American citizenship.
So much for the views of Mr. James
on the constitution. When he refers to
i Washington, the anniversary of whose
i birth was this year celebrated with
I more than ordinary enthusiasm, he is
i equally unfortunate. To the "Father of
I his Country" he attributes a "magnifi
cent personality," but as he never rode
on a trolley or a railroad and had not
been prophetically educated in the mod-
I crn applications of electricity, we are
! informed that, although "not a back
i number," "his ashes are not up to
j date." If Washington was not scien
-1 tlflcaUy Inspired at least he had a pro
phetlc vision for his country and an
ticipated and endeavored to counteract
the retrogressive tendencies of the ex
pansionists. He and his compatriots
framed a new form of government and
produced the conditions that, without
treachery to its principles, assured its
permanence. But Washington foresaw
that a time might come when there
would be a concerted effort to revert
to the repudiated type of governraentt
that originated in divine right, the an
tithesis of the sovereignty of man, that I
characterized the middle ages. His
fears have been justified, for it is not
some new advance, not discovered when
our constitution was formed, that the i
expansionists p jpose, but a reversion j
to the substance, perhaps to the very
forms, that, in his double capacity of
General and President, Washington so
largely aided to overthrow. It is for
tunate that the last celebration in
honor of his memory proved that "even
In his ashes live their wonted fires,"
for the theme of most of those who con
tributed to the education of the dai i
was the maintenance and the perpe
tuity of the American republic, -with it*,
cornerstone unchanged. "And whoso
ever shall fall on this stone shall be
broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall
it will grind him into powder." Our
country is not yet to be turned Into an
imperial missionary, spreading Ameri
can civilization with navies and armies |
among benighted Asiatics, or marching j
arm in arm with Great Britain toward j
universal dominion.
A few of the other suggestions of Mr.
James grew out of the basic miscon- r
ception to which I have alluded v For j
example he doubts whether Solomon ;
would have made a satisfactory presi- j
dent of the Stanford University. That |
admirable Institution is fortunate In J
the possession of a president who is at j
least on the road to greatness, but if
It* were deprived of his services I think
he would agree with me that a resus
citated Solomon would make an excel- j
lent substitute, who would probably
learn the new facts that Mr. James con- i
founds with principles with unusual ;
facility. He would be likely also, as he i
grasped the projects of American ex
pansionists, to repeat his declaration !
that "there is nothing new under the I
sun," and to disagree with Mr. James j
about the inapplicability of the pre
cedent of republican Rome. And al
though it might take some months or
years for Washington to master the in
ventions of a century, if he revived it
Is my deliberate opinion that he would |
make a greater President than ever, i
With due reverence I would rather see
him sitting on President McKinley
than, as represented by a New York
pictorial. President McKinley sitting on j
him. However, there is probably no I
occasion for either to sit on the other,
as I have yet to learn that our present
chief magistrate is infected with the
imperial delirium, which is also rapidly
dying out among the loyal citizens of
the country.
I appreciate the courtesy and the \
graphic terseness of Mr. James, but I :
still remain an American, wedded to tho ;
constitution and politically tied to this ;
continent, while rejoicing at the com- j
mercial prospect that, if we are true to i
ourselves, no European combinations
will obscure.

NOT KNOWNâ T. M., City. This de

an answer is obtainable. The address of
the party asked for by you some time

your name instead of initials to your let

you did neither, and write a second letter
complaining that your query was not an

one might ask, and there was no reason
for concealing the identity of the writer

ADVERSE POSSESSIONâ H. M., San
Mateo, Cal. In relation to adverse pos
session In this State the law says:
For the purpose of constituting an adverse
possession by a person claiming title, not
founded upon a written Instrument, Judgment
or decree, land Is deemed to have been pos
sessed and occupied In the following manner
only: Firstâ Where it has been protected by a
substantial enclosure. Second â Where It has
been usually cultivated or Improved. Pro
vldfd. however, that In no case shall adverse
lÂ«.sse?sifin be considered established under the
provision of any of the sections or section of
this code, unless It shall be shown that the
land has been occunled and claimed for the
period of five years continuously, and the party
or persons, their predecessors and grantors,
have iai(\ all the taxes, State, county or muni
cipal which have been levied and assess upon
suth land.
In the case cited in the letter of Inquiry
it appears that the owner of the land has
never given up possession thereof and
that the tenant is a tenant at will, and
may, on -thirty days' notice, be required
to vacate. The condition upon which the
tenant became possessed of the property
would in all probability, if the case should
come into court, not change the position
of tenant at wlll^
VOTING MACHINEâ Reader. San Jose,
Cal. No State has} yet adopted a voting
machine, though in several sections of the
country there have been experiments in
a small way with machines. One of the
most satisfactory that has been tried of
late years is that Invented by John W.
Raines of St. Paul, Minn., which he calls
a votograph. It is provided with a set
of keys of one color for the Republican
party, one of another color for the Dem
o cratic party and there may be aa many
different eets of colored keys as there
are parties. There Is a space for the par
ticular office and another for the names
of candidates for that office. The voter
presses down one of the keys to Indicate
his choice for a candidate, and as he does
so it locks the keys of all candidates for
the same office, so that there cannot be
any repeating. As the vote is cast for
the candidate the total number of votes
is registered, so that at the close of the
polls, when the machine Is opened the to
tal number of votes cast for each candi
date appears and inside of ten minutes
after the machine is opened the result of
the vote can be announced. Another fea
ture is that when the voter nas voted for
all he wishes to the machine is locked,
and can only be reset for the next voter
when the voter has left the booth. Those
who have an Interest for purity of elec
tion demand a machine that will be per
fect and simple, so that a voter will not
bo confused when votinr.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 4.â The bicycle
racers stormed the town to-day, and
j the Garden City gave up to them with*
j out a murmur. The occasion was the
opening of a big two days' meet at Cy
clers' Park, and all the cracks who
'have recently been competing in San
Francisco are here to contest for honor
and money.
The races began at 2 o'clock In the
afternoon. The event of the day was
a ten-mile match race between Orlando
I I. Stevens of lowa and Harry M. Gib
son of Cincinnati. Stevens was paced
by Fournier's "infernal machine" and
j Gibson by two triplets and three tan
! deme. Fournier, by sitting almost
' upright on his motor machine, was abie
to shield Stevens almost entirely from
the wind, and this advantage was so
great in Stevens' favor that he caught
and passed Gibson after they had rid
i den three miles. Stevens kept right on,
and Gibson also stuck bravely to his
work, although he must have known it
was a losing game. Stevens was paced
so fast, however, that in the seventh
mile he again passed his opponent.
Gibson's pacemakers then tacked on
behind Stevens and held their man
even for another mile, the order being
Fournier's machine, then Stevens, Gib
son's triplet pacing machine, then Gib
son. The pace was a little too hot for
"Michael No. 2," however, and on the
ninth lap Gibson faltered, losing his
pace and falling back a half lap. Ste
vens never failed and held the killing
pace to the end, finishing strong.
Stevens won the jnatch and the purse,
his time for the ten miles being
' 19:38 2-5. Gibson finished the full dis
tance, though beaten two laps. Stevens
rode every mile in less than two min
utes.
The one-mile handicap professional
event was run in three heats and a
final, and proved very interesting, as
nearly all the cracks were entered. In
the first heat the starters were Teddy
Goodman, 15 yards; William Furman,
25; AJ Weinig, 40; Charles Turville, 75; !
j and Charles S. Wells, 90. Furman is in ;
I fine condition and when the sprint came
! he was right there, winning from Wells
'â¢ in a dashing ride. Goodman was third :
; and Weinig fourth. Time, 2:37.
In the second heat were Jay Eaton on
! scratch; Hardy Downing, 15 yards;
! John Chapman, 30; Earl D. Stevens, 35;
j and Henry Pilkington. 135. Eaton punc
j tured his tire on the second lap and
', was out of it. The back mark men
! would not exchange pace and conse- j
! quently Pilkington virtually walked in.
! Time, 2:23 2-5. Downing had no diffi
culty in disposing of the others for sec
ond place and Stevens took third.
The third heat was the most ioterest
-1 ing and proved the fastest of the three.
I The starters were Iver Lawson, 20
i yards; Frank Cotter, 25; Tom Barna-
I by, 35; Ed Leonart, 35; Fredericks, 75;
Nawn, 60; Clem Turville, 100. By ex
changing pace Cotter and Lawson soon
I cut down the leaders, and, once in
front, won as they pleased in the order
named, Leonart taking third and Tur
ville fourth. Time, 2:11 1-5.
The starters in the final heat were
Furman, Wells, Pilkington, Downing,
Cotter, Lawson and Leonart. Wells
; and Pilkington paced each other from
the long handicaps, and Cotter did the
donkey work for the back mark men,
hoping to pull through his team mate,
Downing. According to schedule, Cot
ter dropped out on the last lap, and |
Downing forged ahead, but they had â¢
failed to count on "Big Bill" Furman j
! of the Bay City Wheelmen, and Iver |
Lawson and Eddie Leonart. These
three were still "in it," and, passins
Wells and Pilkington on the last turn,
the quartet forged ahead and fought it
out down the home stretch, Furman
' winning, Downing second, Lawson
j third and Leonart fourth. The time
'. was 2:10.
Mons. Henri Fournier of Paris and
' Tom Barnaby of Boston brought out
' Fournier's famous motor tandem for
an exhibition mile. Fournier could not
make much speed out of his tandem on
the San Francisco track, owing to the
difficulty of controlling it on the short
turns, but on the big track here it was
easy, and they covered the mile in the
astonishing time of I:3S, which is the
I fastest mile ever ridden on a track in
California on a bicycle, horse or any
thing that doesn't run on rails. The
performance was warmly applauded.
The starters in the Australian pur
suit race were: Downing-Cotter, Chap-.
I man-Furman, Turville-Goodman. JuÂ»
! lius-Lawson and Fredericks-Nawn. The
nature of the race was that the teams
should start at five different points on
the track and ride until one team had
overtaken and passed all the others.
The race was very exciting and for a
while the men remained equally as far
apart as when they started. Finally,
after three miles riding, Fredericks and
Nawn caught Goodman and Turville
and the latter team at once quit. Fred
ericks and Nawn then went after
Downing and Cotter and caught them
after a mile chase, passing Furman
and Chapman in the meantime. They
then had left only Lawson and Julius
to overtake, but the latter team did not
give in so easily. In fact both teams
were strong, all four riders being re
cent contestants in the six-day race In
San Francisco and well conditioned for
I a long, hard ride. On the back stretch
Fredericks and Nawn met with a mis
hap, however, puncturing their front
tire and they had to give it up, much
to their disgust. Julius and Lawson
passed them and finished the ride up
to six miles, which they did in 12:21. a
new world's record for the distance,
the best previous time being 12:54.

The way to be well is to pay attention j

They are the most important organs
of the body â the blood filters.
All the blood in your body passes
through your kidneys once every three

The kidneys strain or filter out the .

work.
Purifying your blood is not a question
of taking a laxative or physic.
Does your blood run through your

What the bowel-cleaner does Is to j
throw out the poisons confined in your j
bowels ready for absorption into your !
blood, but the poisons which are al- j
ready in your blood, causing your |

There is no other way of purifying
your blood except by means of your |
kidneys. ]
That is why bowel-cleanera fail to do j
their workâ they forget the kidneys.
When you are sick, then, no matter
what you think the name of your dis

to afford aid to your kidneys by using I

BAKERSFTET/D. March 4.â A few days
ago three ice companies doing business
hereâ the National, the Union and the
San Jnaquinâ formed a combine, put the
business under one management and
raised the price of ice 100 per cent. Now
the saloon men, about sixty in number,
have organized to buy ice from an inde
pendent firm at Stockton at a much lower
figure They will establish an ice depot
at the Valley road and ship over that line.
In time they will supply other consumers.
They will not patronize the combine under
any' circumstances. They ordered their

ton. Ten tons just delivered yielded $8000.
The mine is owned by Scanlon & Bell of
Shasta. It was not regarded as a very
promising piece of property, but in per
forming the annual assessment work a
pay streak was encountered that is mak
ing the property a regular bonanza.

PROVES A BONANZA
New Shasta CouQty StriKe Yields
a Thousand Dollars to
the Toi>
REDDING, March 4.â The lucky miners who made the rich gold
strike at Furnaceville were in town to-day to receive the returns from
their shipment of $3757 in gold to the United States Mint in San Fran-
They made another shipment to-day of $500, the result of three
days' work with a hand mortar.
W. M. Dale, one of the three partners, said this afternoon that every
ounce of gold they had taken out was pounded out of the ore in the hand
mortar or came from the ledge in the shape of nuggets.
"We haven't any means of working the lower grade rock," said Mr.
Dale, "but are taking it from the mine as we go along and we esti
mate that our dump will average $1000 to the ton in free gold."
Some handsome quartzr gold specimens were exhibited again to-day.
These are not included in the shipment to the Mint, as they will bring
a higher price as .^pocimens. Miners and prospectors about the hotels
here are much interested in the strike and a number have gone to the
scene.

Absorbs the Mellwood Distillery in
Kentucky.
LOTJISVILLK, Ky., March 4.â The
K -mucky Distilleries and Warehouse
company, the latest combine in the
whisky world, to-day purchased the
plant of the Mellwood Distillery in this
city. The price is in the neighborhood
of $1,000,000.
CINCINNATI, March 4.â Since the
organization of the Kentucky Distiller
ies an<l Warehouse Company, whisky
men have been guessing as to what the
policy of the combine will be. Vice
President Bradley has given out the
following:
"No trade relations respecting the
middlemen or the making of prices will
be radically changed by the present
consolidation. Prices will be gauged
rding to the price of grain and the
supply and demands of the finished
products. Few distilleries will be con
tinued according to the value. There
will be no conflict with the American
Sprits Manufacturing Company or the
Standard Distilling and Distributing:
Company."

GREAT BRITAIN
France to Make Conces
sions in Madagascar.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, March 4.â Very favorable
j reports were received this week regard
| ing the negotiations on outstanding
; questions between Great Britain and
: France. It is said that M. Dupuy, the
â  French Premier, has decided to en
| deavor to settle all questions and that
; in the question of Madagascar he has
i made up his mind to propose important
\ tariff modifications in favor of Great
â¢ Britain, thus removing the cause of the
! bitter complaints that the French
practically killed British trade imme
i diately after Ihe protectorate over the
island of Madagascar was declared by
erecting a tariff barrier.
The question of the Bahr-el-Ghazel
Valley is also said to be in a fair way
lof settlement. France has agreed to
i barter her claims for a fair considera
i tion elsewhere and the Muscat (Sultan
ate of Oman) difficulty has been tided
over by an arrangement by which
I France gets her coalsheds and saves
her honor, but does not make any ter
ritorial acquisition. Great Britain got
her back up against the latter feature
of the question because she suspected
France wanted a coaling station in
Oman, not for herself, but for Russia,
i who would make it the terminus of a j
I Central Asia railroad from Turkestan
i to the Persian Gulf.
So great a pressure has been put upon
the president of the Board of Trade, C.
i T. Ritchie, that he has postponed the
second reading of the automatic coup
ling bill, a measure which gives the
I Board of Trade power, five years hence,
to compel British railroads to supply
the whole of their rolling stock with
automatic couplings. Reports indicate
that the cost of the innovation will be
$50,000,000. There are, it is added, 1,000,
--i 000 cars in Great Britain of which one
i half are owned by private companies,
: which are up in arms against the ex
: pense.

GUERRA'S REBELLION

Forces of President Andrade of Ven

Near Morro Cayes.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York

CARACAS, Venezuela, March 4.âSup
porters of President Andrade rejoiced to
day over the news that the Government
forces had won a decisive victory over
Senor Guerra. the president of the new
State of Guarico, who recently organized
a rebellion.

NEW YORK. March 4.â The Herald's

rising led by General Guerra, who was
President of the new Venezuela state and
was formerly Minister of War in Presi
dent Crespo's Cabinet. He gained no force
j m Congress, however, and President An

CONGRESS PREVENTED
SHAFTER'S PROMOTION
War Department Was Eager to Make
Him a Major General Before
His Retirement.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â The Presi
dent expresses himself as well pleased in
â¢ general with the outcome of the session
i of Congress just closed. He takes a hope
| ful view of conditions, believing the rail-
I ures of Congress to meet the requirements
â¢ in several instances will not operate to
embarrass the Government seriously. It
was the purpose of the President, had
i Congress listened favorably to his re
quest for authority to appoint four addi
tional major generals, to have named
Gtmrals Fitzhugh Lee, Wheeler, Wilson
and Wood.
It was a bitter disappointment to the
! War Department that the request of the
President for authority to appoint only
one additional major general of regulars
should have been negatived. It was thÂ°
gurpose to name for that honor General
hafter, in order that he might retire with
i the laurels he has earned. The general
i must be retired by law on the 14th of the
present month and must go out with only
i a volunteer commission. It is the purpose
! to give him at least this.

WOLCOTTS ARE
NOW SEPARATED
Senator and Wife to Be
Divorced.
SUIT SOON TO BE BEGUN
INCOMPATIBILITY OF TEMPER
THE ALLEGED GROVND.
Story of Domestic TJnliappiness That
Will Startle the Most Ex
clusive Set in Wash
ington.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 4.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: In the most exclusive social
set in Washington the fact is known
to a few personal friends that Senator
Edward O. Wolcott, the brilliant young
Senator from Colorado, and his wife,
have separated. Legal proceedings are
about to be instituted for an annull
| merit of their relations, at the instance
of Mrs. Wolcott.
Senator Wolcott is now staying at
the Arlington Hotel and has been there
for four days, while his wife remains
at their handsome residence on Con
necticut avenue.
That Senator and Mrs. Wolcott have
agreed to separate is not denied by in
terested persons, but in view of the
high position they occupy in official
and social circles, the matter is being
kept very quiet, with the expectation
that Mrs. Wolcott will proceed to Colo
rado and procure a legal separation
without any undue publicity being
' given to their domestic infelicities.
Friends of Senator Wolcott insist that
I there is nothing savoring of scandal in
I the proceedings. Close friends of Sena
; tor Wolcott told me that a legal separ-
I ation would be sought by Mrs. Wolcott
j simply on the grounds of incompatibil
ity of temper. I am also advised from
! the same source that no other persons
are directly or indirectly connected
with the affair, and a separation is to
be obtained by mutual agreement.
Senator Wolcott will interpose no ob
jection. Mrs. Wolcott is acting upon
I the advice of her brother, Dr. Metcalf,
| who is now In Washington with her.
1 Senator Wolcott, while admitting the
; separation and forthcoming divorce, de
i clines to discuss the subject. At the
: Wolcott residence neither Dr. Metcalf
I nor Mrs. Wolcott were willing to make
any statement for publication.
The news that Senator and Mrs. Wol
cott have separated will come as a se
vere shock to the social circle of which
I they are conspicuous members. It ha*
! been whispered in their set that domes
i tic happiness was not the most attrac
tive feature of the handsome and richly
furnished home of the Wolcotts, but
'â  there was no dream of legal proceed
, ings looking to a separation.
Senator and Mrs. Wolcott have been
in society together within the last
week or ten days, and on Washington's
birthday Mrs. Wolcott was one of the
most interested listeners to the read
! ing of Washington's farewell address
j by her husband in the Senate cham
ber. Their home has been the cen
ter of many brilliant gatherings since
they came to Washington, for Mrs.
Wolcott has a large fortune in her own
right, and the Senator has a iarere mi
i come outside of his salary as Senator.
Mrs. Wolcott is the daughter of Mrs.
E. M. Metcalf of North street, â Buffalo.
Mrs. Metcalf is the leader of Buffalo's
most exclusive society. Mrs. Wolcott
has one son, Metcalf Bass, who Is a
graduate of Yale. He received a com
mission in the volunteer service at the
beginning of the war with Spain.
Laces can be made to represent large
sums of money. The Astors have been
credited with owning lace worth $3,000,000
and the Vanderbilts value theirs at $4,0^0,
--00n The Pope is said to be content with
only $75,000 represented in lace, and the
Princess of Wales can boast of $250,000.

BERLIN, March 4.â The rejection of
part of the provisions of the military
bill by the Center members of the bud
get commission has created amaze
ment. This is explained by the fact
that the Center is waiting for certain
concessions to the ultramontane inter
ests. This, it is said, has been agreed
upon and the Center will vote for the
bill.
It was reported that the concessions
include the appointment of a Catholic
department, a chief of a Catholic sec
tion of the Ministry of Public Worship,
the amending of the municipal election
law to give the Center dominion over
the Rhine cities, and it is also claimed
that the Bundesrath will sanction the
repeal of the ostracization of the Jes
uits and other orders.
The officials of the German Foreign
Office say that considerable time will
probably elapse before the claims for
damages filed by German manufactur
ers and merchants in Cuba during the
war will be proved. These claims now
amount to several million dollars,
mainly by three firms for factories and
plantations burned by the Cuban in
surgents. The question as to whether
the Spanish, Cuban or American Gov
ernment is responsible is another diffi-
Tiie Russian tyrannizing of Finland
is severely commented upon in political
circles, even among the conservatives,
the Kreuz Zeitung forcibly voicing
these sentiments.
In the Reichstag this week the Min
ister of War, General yon Gossler, re

sire for the strictest investigation into
the matter. The Minister added that
according to the present information
there were not many officers compro
mised.
The Tageblatt to-day denies this and
says over a hundred active officers be
long to the club, adding on one oc
casion among the forty-two persona
present were thirty-six uniformed oili
cers, and that another notorious gam

The Post, discussing the increase of

It claims that not only were 6919 horses
directly imported, but that many more
came into the country by way of Bel
gium and Holland, and adds that this
is detrimental to agricultural interests.
By the Emperor's orders the Thier
garten, which is crown property,
though it is the chief park of Berlin, is
to be modernized. About 30,000 trees
are to be felled, ornamental shrubs are
to be planted, new walks, children's
playgrounds and tennis courts are to be
created and other improvements are to
be made.

give a diplomatic dinner, the guests in

The Reichstag to-day agreed by a

Prince Hohenlohe. the Imperial

President Cuestas has organized his
new Cabinet with elements of different

The press condemns severely the fe
licitation which the American Minis

his note Minister Finch says, among

THREE COFFEE WRECKS.
Plain Facts Worth Considering.
For the past six years, up to twelve
month* ago, I was a perfect wreck and
Flave to coffee. It kept me in a pros-
trated condition continually.
Gradually my heart became affected,
find I suffered intense pain in the left
Bide and over the region of the heart.
ry now and then had nervous
ppells that laid me up for weeks at a
I was also troubled with short-
ness of breath whenever 1 exerted my-
eelf in any way.
I could not lie on my left side and my
eleep was broken with severe pains
and smothering sensations. The doc-
tor told me that it was coffee drinking.
I put myself under his treatment but
did not leave off the coffee, and as I
obtained no help, became despondent
and gloomy.
By chance I learned of the Postum
Food Coffee, and concluded I would
try and quit the coffee habit and use
Postum. After a week's time I felt
greatly Improved, and continued using
the Postum and am still using it My
appetite returned to me and I gradu-
ally re-gained my health and strength,
and am now as well and hearty as I
f-ver was. I have had no return of my
heart trouble since using Postum.
I do not understand that Postum Is
In any way a medicine, but that it is a
food whereas the ordinary coffee Is a
vÂ«ry powerful drug, as shown m my
CBse and many others.
Two of my near neighbors were ad-
dicted to coffee, and it treated them
much as it did me. They are Mrs. M.
N. Powell and Mrs. Mary Pitts.
When they found what a change had
been made in me by leaving off coffee
and using Postum, they threw away
their old coffee pots, got some new
ones and began to use Postum. me
first time they tried it they did not
like it very well, but they soon found
that they had not allowed it to boll
long enough. Now they are two as
healthy ladies as you ever saw, rosy
and well; their physical aches and ills
all gone. They sleep and eat well and
seem to enjoy life better than they ever
did before. Mrs. Emma Harris, Paris,

ATTACK UMBSEN & CO.
Suit Filed Against Them to Recover
Heavy Damages.
Suit was filed yesterday by .T. A. Camp
bell and P. A. Wilberg fetinst C. ll.l'mb-
Ben & Co. to recover $13,000 damages and
$500 paid on account of a purchase, the
damasks being sought for certain alleged
fraudulent acts and representations on
the part of the defendants corporation.
It Is averred by the plaintiffs that on
LBth nil. tho defendants "falsely and
fraudulently and Id bad faith" represent
ed that they had full power to sell to the
plaintiffs for the price of $12,000 a piece
t)f property on the southwest corner of
WashinÃtxin street and Dunbar alloy. An
agreement was drawn up between the
parties and $500 .was paid to the defendants
by the plaintiffs as a part of the pur
chase price. Subsequently, it is alii eed,
the plaintiffs have offered to pay the bal
ance duo, but the defendants refuse to de
liver them a deed of conveyance.
The plaintiffs also assert that they have
been informed that the defendants had
no power or authority to sell the proper
ty, or even to agree to convey it. For
these reasons they seek to recover dam
ages in the amount stated and the money
already paid out under the alleged fraud
ulent agreement.
Two Damage Suits.
William H. Coulter has sued the Union
Transportation Company to recover $10,000
damages for personal injuries and certain
tortious acts of the defendant. The plain
tiff avers that on February 21 last he
was refused a ticket on the steamer
Dauntless to Benicia, and when he In
sisted that one should be sold him he was
Beverely handled by the defendant's offi
cials.
J. J. Schutz had the misfortune to fall
through a hole in the sidewalk at the
corner of Ellis and Octavia streets a
short time ago and yesterday he filed suit
against the owner of the property front
ing on the sidewalk, Sarahd H. Macauley,
also Superintendent of Streets Fragley, to
recover $10,000 damages.
Baldwin Fence a Nuisance.
Shopkeepers on the south side of Ellis
street, between Stockton and Powell, have
petitioned the Board of Supervisors to de
clare the fence about the Baldwin prop
erty a nuisance and to have it set back
where the law allows it to be maintained.
The petitioners affirm that traffic on the
south side of the street has ceased en

THE SAS FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1899.
The new vessels will, of course, be
lighted with electricity throughout. They
will also have something that has l'>ng
been required on steamers in the Austral
asian trade and that is a refrigerating
plant. Australia and New Zealand are
large exporters of frozen beef and mutton,
and shipload after shipload is going from
there to Manila to feed the United States
soldiers and sailors. There is a demand
fur the frozen meat in California, and the
new steamers will meet this demand by
carrying New Zealand mutton to San
Francisco. Five cents a pound is a big
price to pay for mutton in Australia or
New Zealand, while here 12^> cents is con
sidered cheap.
Besides the frozen meat cargo the
steamers will carry 2~>oo tons of general
cargo and 2000 tons of coal in their bunk
ers. They will be built to comply with the
navy regulations and when in service can
be turned into auxiliary cruisers inside of
thirty-six hours.
BOZICH THREW AWAY
THE GOLD OF LIFE
STJICIDE OF A DEMENTED SLA
VONIAN MINER.
Placed a Mirror Between His Knees
to Take Good Aim, and Shot
Himself.
Bozo Bozich, a Slavonian miner, shot
himself in the head yesterday morning or
Friday night in his room at 272 Brannan
street. Although undoubtedly insane he
made his preparations for death with the
greatest care and deliberation. He took
the mattress off his bed and laid It on
the floor. Then he sat on it, placed a
small mirror between his knees so as to
take better aim, placed to his head the
muzzle of the suicide's delightâ a cheap
American bulldog â pulled the trigger and
died instantly.
The lodging-house in which Bozich
killed himself is kept by a Slavonian
named Joe Qallovich. The deceased not
making his appearance for breakfast. Joe
entered his room at 10 o'clock and found
the gory corpse cold and rigid in death.
On the person of the dead man were
found the following notes, written In
Slavonian:
Brothers, no friends, no enemies: thpy hlnme
me, but God will juriÃc them. Good-by, world,
sun and moon. Good-by home; good-by dear
Joe. BOZ.
A policeman was looking for me; I don't
know why I am here. I lived nine years
here and never have been in jail, nor have
any of my relatives. Enemies'. I'd sooner
die than have a pollcemar take me to jail.
Bozich came from the country about a
week ago and took a room in Gallovich's
house. Nothing is known as to his ante
cedents or relatives. Thirty-seven dol
lars cash found in his pockets were turned
over to the Coroner.
The body was taken to the Morgue.

A REFEREE SELECTED.
Smith and Lavigne Have Chosen Jim
McDonald as Judge of Their
Fight.
The representatives of Georg-e "Kid"
Lavigne and Billy Smith met last even-
Ing at Charley Geggus' sporting resort on
Stockton street for the purpose of select
ing a referee for their fight, which will
take place next Friday evening in Wood
ward's Pavilion. The managers of the two
fighters did not delay very long in se
lecting the man whom they considered to
be the best referee. As soon as Billy La
vigne read from a prepared list of sports
the name of Jim McDonald Smith's man
ager said "that's enough; McDonald will
suit me," and without further delay the
famous baseball umpire was notified of
his selection.
There is a great demand for good seats
at this early hour, which is an evidence
that the Pavilion will be packed on Fri
day evening.
The Trust Was Valid.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
decision of the lewer court in the case of
the estate of Amasa P. Wllley. In 1892
Wllley made a trust deed of certain prop
erty in favor of two friends, and a few
days later he made a will under which
were various bequests. As the trust deed
It was originally the Intention of the
Oceanic company to have the steamers
built at the Union Iron Works in Kan
Francisco. John D. Spreck< Is, president
of the steamship company, and Irving M.
Scott of the iron w r orks held a number of
conferences, but owing to the number of
contracts in hand it was found impossible
to build the vessels in the specified time.
Mr. Spreckels wants to see the vessels in
commission in March or April. 1900, at the
latest. Mr. Scott decided that what with
the warships and merchant vessels he
was now at work on and those the works
was under contract to build, it would be
impossible to accept the building of the
three steamers if they had to be complet
ed in a year. Mr. Spreckels accordingly
came East last month, and to-night gave
out the news that the contract had been
let to the Cramps.
The Alameda and Mariposa were built
by the Cramps, and two better vessels
feature cut some figure in the will and a
contest was made by the son. the lower
court held that the trust was invalid.
The higher court takes the position that
the trust Is not invalid and does not In
validate the will. The case, with several
branches, will come up for further con
sideration in the Superior Court.
COURT WILjl NOT ASSIST.
Mrs. Virginia McMullin Cannot Se
cure Separate Support.
The Supreme Court has decided that
Mrs. Virginia McMullin is not entitled to
ri celve maintenance without divorce
from her husband, Thurlow McMuliin.
The couple were married in 1871, and six
years later the husband permanently left
home.
In 1891 the wife began an action against
her husband for support, although she did
not desire a legal separation from him.
Kighteen months after these proceedings
were begun McMullin made her an offer
to provide her a good comfortable home
in some place of her own selection, and
return to her. The woman refused the
offer, and the lower court denied her de
mand Cor support.
The order was upheld by the higher
cnun. which sets forth that proceedings
for divorce may be begun one year after
desertion, and ndds that "if prior to the
expiration OI such time the party desert
ing returns and offers in good faith to
fulfill the marriage contract and solicits
condonation the desertion Is cured." The
court further believes that the time limit
for those who repent should be extended.
In this, as in many cases, reconciliations
may be made more as matters of con
venience, but the law takes the position
that even under such conditions it Is bet
ter th?n to break up families. The order
of the lower court was upheld.
WORKED TO DEATH.
The Mother of a Family of Small
Children Suddenly Taken Away.
In order to save herself, her husband and
her three little children from starvation,
Mrs. Angela Tett of 128 Oak Grove ave
nue worked herself to death.
At noon yesterday while engaged In fin
ishing a dress on her sewing machine she
sank back into her chair and breathed her
last.
When Coronetr Hill arrived at the resi
dence he found the bereaved husband,
Henry Tett, almost distracted, and the
children, the oldest of whom Is only foui
years of age. hanging over the dead body
and begging her to speak to them.
The family came from Nlles. in this
State, three months ago. Unable to secure
employment the husband performed the
household duties while his wife, an expert
dressmaker, worked for the small pittance
that barely kept soul and body together.
Bhe was only 29 years old. but her short
life had been one of toll and sorrow.

circular saw, when his left hand slipped

boy was taken to the Receiving Hospital
in the patrol wagon, where the hand was
amputated by Dr. Weil. The boy lost
considerable blood owing to the long dis

Australia in Her Old Hawaiian

The Government has again called into

bered that this vessel was used by the
War Department last year and was re

replacing the volunteer forces In the Phil

the transportation of horses, mules and

TWO WAYWARD GIRLS.
Daisy Warner Tells a Fairy Story to
Judge Graham.
Daisy Warner, a protty girl, 16 years of
age, was arrested in a saloon on Califor
nia and Dupont streets early yesterday
morning by Policeman Chappelle and Offi
cer McMurray of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children. She was
with Jennie Moyles, a girl 18 years of age,
who bears an unenviable character.
The two girls were taken before Judge
Graham yesterday, when Daisy said she
had been married in a tent at the Presidio
on December 12 to John Gilmore, a tailor,
who had become a soldier.
The cases were continued till to-mor
row, and Officer McMurray found later
that no marriage license had been pro
cured, and Daisy admitted that she had
been romancing. Her father is a soldier
in Manila, and she does not know where
her mother is. Mrs. Montgomery -took
pity on the girl recently and sent her to
the Beulah home, but she ran away from
it on Monday last and joined the Moyles
girl.

NATIONAL GUARD NOTES.
Hen Have Become Tired of Waiting
for tne Re-establishment of the
State Soldiery.
Another week has passed without any j
definite result looking to the re-establish
ment of the National Guard of the State.
The only thing toward that end has been
the placing of the Dickinson bill on the
special file of the Senate. The men who
had signified thfir intention some time
ago of entering the service have taken on
a huge disgust, and it is doubtful if one
third of those who declared their inten
tion of becoming State soldiers would
now shoulder a musket.
For many weeks scarcely a company
except the Signal Corps of the Second
Brigade and the Naval Militia has held a j
meeting, and a reason for this is that j
there are no officers and no arms with
which to drill. A member of the guard,
referring to this condition of affairs, said
yesterday: "Just see what a condition
the State is in now. There is a company
of good men at San Rafael, but it is use
less, not having an armory nor a stack of

"A LACK OF INTENT."
Charge of Manslaughter Against As
semblyman Kenneally
Dismissed.
The charge of manslaughter against
Assemblyman Charles F. Kenneally for
causing the dr.-ith of William Quane, an ;
old rrint^r, on December 29 last, was dis- j
irlssed by Judge Mogan yesterday.
In givincr his decision the Judge said j
one of the principal witnesses for the !
prosecution had materially contradicted
his evidence before the Coroner, and be
sid< B there had been a lack of intent. The
evidence showed that the defendant had
merely shoved the old man away from
him, and ho fell, striking the back of his
head against the curbstone.
The prosecuting witness was not vin
dictive," and did not evince any disposi
tion to prosecute the case. He was satis
-1 fied that no jury would convict, and
thought it would put the city and county
j to needless expense to hold the defendant.
ATTORNEY NAGLE'S RING.
Mrs. Nellie E. Rodgers. the Pretty
Milliner, Arraigned for Steal
ing It.
Mrs. Nellie E. Rodgers, the pretty Geary
street milliner, looked smiling and confi
dent in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
morning when her case was called. She
was represented by Attorneys Whittaker
and Linforth. Attorney C. G. Nagle was
also in court and had an attorney to look
afiter his Interests.
When the complaint was read it was
found that Attorney Nagle in drawing it
up had omitted to insert the letter "s" be
fore the word "he."' so that Mrs. Rod
gers was always referred to as "he." The
Judge ruled that this omission was fatal
to the complaint, but agreed to allow the
necessary alterations to be made and the
defendant was instructed and arraigned
on the charge of stealing Nagle's diamond
rlns. By consent the preliminary exam
ination was set for March S.

bonds. He was also convicted of battery
upon Policeman J. F. Murphy and sen
tenced to six months in the County Jail.

FIELD WORK
Insurance Team Loses
a Close Game.
CARDINAL'S GREAT SHOWING
A SMALL CROWD WITNESSES A
FAST EXHIBITION.
Lanagan's Steady Work in the Box
and His Splendid Support Fea
tures of the Day's
Contest.
If Stanford's representatives put up as
Brood bail later in the season as they did
yesterday in their game with the Fire
man's Fund team, Berkeley will have to
extend itself to land the pennant in the
coming annual tournament. The Cardi
nals played nine Innings without an er
ror, and defeated the local nine by clever
fielding, good base running and hard bat
ting. Added to this, the twirling of Lana-
Ijan was a marked feature. Although he
â was touched up for ten hits, Lanagan
pitched a steady and heady game, fan
ning five of the Fireman's Fund's best
men and only allowing one man to walk
to first. The Palo Alto boys have shown
great improvement in their work. Their
batting was extremely hard, hits well
placed and fielding unusually good.
Despite the fact that four errors are
charged against them, the insurance men
played good ball. Through excellent
fieldir.s: Stanford was unable to score until
the fifth, and then but a solitary tally.
In the next inning, however, the colle
gians cut their opponents' lead down, and
w.Uh victory in their grasp the Cardinal
aggregation tried to lengthen, but barely
managed to add another run in the eighth
inning.
Schmeer at short and McGin at second
were the bright particular stars for the
Insurance men. The game was played in
unusually fast time and was greatly en
joyed by the few hundred spectators who
Witnessed it.

Ethel Hall, a pretty girl 19 years of age,
appeared before Judge Mogan yesterday
to answer a charge of vagrancy. She told
the Judge that she had run away from
her home in San Jose about two months
ago and was anxious to reform and return
to her parents, who were respectable peo
ple, and had given her a good education.
A hoodlum who gave the name of John
Downer had been threatening her if she
attempted to go back home. Downer was
in court. The Judge called him up and
denounced him as a parasite and warned
him not to intimidate the girl on pain of
being sent to jail for six months. Downer
gave the Judge a saucy answer and was
promptly ordered Into custody on a
charge of vagrancy. The case against the
girl was continued till to-morrow.

EXCITING FINALE TO THE
RACING STAKE.
: Formero With Piggott "Up Captured
the Lissak Money â Martin's
Stern Orders on Wheel of
Fortune.
The popularity of Ed Corrlgan, the "Iron
chancellor" of Inglesfde, was attested at
Oakland yesterday, when four thousand
race-goers hooted his crack two-year-old
| Golden Rule as he returned to the stand.
j winner of the Racing stakes. It was no
! doubt the tactics employed that caused
the displeasure of the crowd.
There were but three starters, the Cor
rlgan duo. Sardine and Golden Rule, and
Marcus Daly's filly Ella Boland. The
Corrlgan pair, coupled, were prohibitive
favorites. It was undoubtedly the wish
of the stable to win with Sardine, thus
sparing her stable mate from a penalty.
At the start "Skeets" Martin, on Golden
Rule, broke away first, closely followed
by Ella Boland. Thorpe, on Sardine, hus
tled his mount along, and before a hun
dred yards had been covered cut In, caus
ing Piggott to pull Ella Boland up. The
trio hit the stretch nicely aligned, with
Golden Rule romping and Martin looking
behind for Thorpe. But the Daly entry
seemed to be outfooting Sardine, and
Thorpe again carried Piggott in toward
the rail behind the leader. It was a neat
piece of jockeyship, but Piggott squeezed
between the pair, nearly opposite the
paddock, compelling Golden Rule to win,
and beating Sardine a head for the place.
Piggott received a tremendous ovation
from the crowd, but the hisses, groans
and catcalls tendered the Corrigan pair
were continued for nearly five minutes
This was the only exciting feature of the
day s sport. The Lissak stakes were cap
tured by Formero, the race passing off
without incident. Favorites displayed
rare good taste by annexing four purses
The Lissak stakes for three-year-olds
over one mile attracted a very select field
to the post. Some days ago Formero was
beaten in a race by Olinthus. but Mar
tin's handling of the former was of such
a bungling description that it was plainly
apparent the Sink colt was capable of re
versing the verdict. When the betting
opened yesterday Formero, with Piggott
to ride, opened a 7 to 5 favorite. Then
came a determined play on First Tenor
the Burns & Waterhouse entry, forcing
the books to rub from 4 to 2, and sending
the price against Formero back to the
same quotation. Seven to two was laid
against Olinthus. and 4% to 1 was offered
about Horton. The race was short of de
scription. Piggott took Formero to the
front and, never headed, won cleverly by
over two lengths from Olinthus in 1:41
First Tenor labored along the last half,
but finished gamely, downing Horton a
nose for the small end of the stake.
Prompto. at odds on, led a cheap band
of platers out in the opening six-furlong
scramble. New Moon, ridden by Mounce
succeeded in taking the place from Peter
Weber.

saw Joe Harvey's good mare. Wheel of
Fortune, close a slight choice over Tom
Cromwell. Bullman had been engaged to
ride the mare, but while at the post in
the first event astride Roadwarmer, was
kicked and quite severely Injured by Bon
ibel. This necessitated a change of rid
ers and Mr. Harvey secured the services
of Devin. The betting had progressed for
some minutes and the judges thought a
more experienced rider should be put up.
They mentioned "Skeets" Martin but
Mr. Harvey demurred, saying he d d not
like the ride Martin gave his mare in her
previous race. But Martin was substi
tuted and Mr. Price, presiding steward,
retired to the paddock, where he read a
very interesting lecture to Martin.
"Skeets" handled the "Wheel" faultless
ly and she led Tom Cromwell past the
tape a length in 1:45Â»4. .
Montailade had a strong call in the
betting on the fourth number, a six lur
long sprint, but could not land, in a
driving finish Devin, with the leg upon
the 7 to 1 shot, Sir Urian, reached the
wire a length before Rainier, the favor
ite ending up in third position.
"Daggle" Smith's handy performer
Torsida, ruled a topheavy choice In tne
betting on the closing seven furlong run,
but Ferguson was unkind to her at tne
start. Midlight, ridden by Martin, awa>
living, won all the way. Turner, on the
favorite, got up in time to take the place
from Castake, a 100 to 1 shot, piloted by
John Reiff.

ECHOES FROM THE LINKS.
March Is the Great Golfing Month at
Del Monte.
On Saturday, the 25th ult., there was no
competition on the Oakland links, though
several pairs played friendly practice
matches. This afternoon there will be
men's foursomes for medals to be pre
sented by the club. As several Improve
ments in the course have lately been car
ried out whereby some of the holes have
been lengthend. new score cards are in
preparation and will shortly be issued.
On Friday next, March 10, the
ladies' handicap monthly competition
for the Winslow medal is announced to
take place at the hour of 10 in the morn-
Ing. Miss M. B. Houghton is the present
holder of the medal, having won it at the |
February competition. She is not, as has j
been recently stated, the lady champion
of the San Francisco Golf Club, for the
ladies' championship event is held only
once in each season, and the date set for '
it on the schedule of events for 1898-99 is
May 16 and 17.
There has not hitherto been very much
play on the Del Monte golf links, but 1
March is the great month for golfers j
there. The San Rafael Golf Club is in
creasing rapidly in numbers. It now has
140 members and has raised its initiation
fee from $10 to $25. T. W. Tetley, who ]
laid out the links, is at present in South- j
crn California, and reports that he has an
unusually fine stock of clubs and other i
golf necessaries on hand. An instructor's j
house will be built on the links, which ;
will be occupied by T. W. Tetley on his
return.
The work of dredging Lake Merritt and
draining the arm "between the power house i
and the eighth putting green of the Ad- 'â 
ams Point links is advancing rapidly. A j
levee now runs round one side of the :
green surrounding the eighth hole, and the
following ground rule has been posted at !
the clubhouse: "'Where a ball is driven
Into the water beyond the levee on ap- i
proaching the eighth hole the player may \
drop another ball at the place where the I
last play was made and count another
stroke."
Stoe Los Angele-s Country Club is a cor
poration, and has more than 200 regular ]
and associate members. Its president is
M. S. Severance, and its secretary-treas- ;
urer is John D. Foster. It has a tract of i
forty acres and a nine-hole course, with a j
handsome clubhouse, near the electric
road to Santa Monica. Though it bears
the name "Country Club," it interests it
self mainly in golf.

Who Are Supposed to Know the
Good From the Bad When
Selecting Winners. '
Quite a large crowd of sport lovers took
advantage of a beautiful day and wit
nessed the run down of an excellent
coursing card yesterday at Ingleside
Park.
Among the admirers of coursing who
put in an appearance at Ingleside was
Mr. Massey of Wyoming, who is on a
business visit to this coast. Mr. Massey
arrived on Friday, and immediately hunt
ed up his old friend Judge Grace.
"With me there arrived a few particular
friends," said Mr. Massey, "which are
commonly called longtails. The dogs that
have been accustomed to cold weather,
but who in future will enjoy the pleasures
of your beautiful climate, are named
Wigmore, 4Vi years old; Winning Style, 3
years old, and Marcus, 4' 2 years old The
two former dogs were born in the Emer
ald Isle, and when they will have become i
acclimated I think they will render good
accounts of themselves. Marcus is a big!
and strong follow, who will tip the scales j
a * 65 pounds. He is by Boomerang-Pearl I
of Peking. I think the new arrivals will
do well after they have had a chance to
study the country."
The coursing of yesterday was, as is
usual, hrst class, and the large concourse
ot up-to-date sporting men left the park
fully determined to be on the grounds at i
an early hour to-day to see the final runs I
of the meeting.
The longest course of yesterday was be
tween \ anity Fair and Whisk Broom. It
lasted 3 minutes and 45 .seconds. Those
who played the short ends on the follow
ing races retired with smiling faces, viz.:
Capadura vs. Black Night; Lawrence vs.
Royal Buck, the oads 5 to 1; Peter M vs
Persecution; Black Bess vs. l.i.ssuk- Be-
n ,'. < ;!j S oy vs - J ' as Palmas; Johnny R vs.
Wild Traleo; Magdallah vs. Grasshopper.

AT UNION PARK.
Dogs Ban to Form in the Open
Stakes.
The coursing at Union Park yesterday
was of a high order. The beautiful
weather drew an unusually large crowd,
and the betting was lively. The dogs ran
well to form, except in the Consolation
stake, and the favorites had the best of
it. The hares were fast, and many of the
courses were long and exciting. Dennis
& Porter's October Woodcock, an im
ported brindle dog, by Meilford Swell, out
of Neredah, made his debut and beat W.
Creamer's Jersey Lily easily, leading to
the hare by ton lengths. Great things are
expected of October Woodcock, and he
and Interesting will probably be the final
contenders to-day.
Minneapolis was a 10 to 1 favorite over
Star Pointer and won. but not until she
had been forced to run for her life. Star
Pointer surprised every one by his game
ness. Rock Island Boy made Beauty
Spot look like a counterfeit dollar, al
though both dogs were even money in
the books. The former easily led to the
hare and killed in a lightning drive be
fore Beauty Spot could score. Moondyne
had a narrow escape in his course with
Pretender. lie was slipped unsighted and
ran wild three-fourths of the distance to
the hare. In the pointing he was fre
quently off, but managed to take charge
of the hare after a long run and score
enough points to win.
Hurricane on the short end upset Ida
in a fairly long course by superior speed
and better handling of the hare. Van
Cloie, against whom was laid 5 to 1, gave
Royal Flush a warm argument. He won
by a nose in a short course. Tic Tac, the
favorite at 2 l ? to 1, was easily beaten by
Victor King in a hard course. Green Val
ley Maid, In her course with Swedish, was
the favorite. She had hard luck, the hare
favoring Swedish in the wrenches, who
won by a good margin. O'Grady kept up
the short-enders' victories in the Consola
tion stake by easily defeating One Spot, a
2Vi to 1 favorite. Flush and False Flat
terer ran to form and helped backers of
favorites to recuperate. Miller's Robbie
beat War Cloud easily, the latter quitting
like a dub, and a fresh hound was turned
loose to kill the hare in order to save Mil
ler's Robbie. Firm Friend, a 9 to 1 fa
vorite, easily beat Belle Seward.

week saw but little active work on the
courts. â¢
The Whitneys. Robert N. and George,
and Root and Bliven played a hot match
on Thursday. The former team gave the
latter thirty and it proved too big a hand
icap, for Root and Bliven won out in, a
very close set of 10â8. The four players
then engaged in a series of singles, pro
ductive of some very close scores with
an equal division of honors on all sldrs.
During this week the players of trie

Doubles, singles, mixed doubles and la
dies' tournaments will be on the pro

Supposed Bridegroom Disappears to

No Wedding.
The gossips In the neighborhood of
Wet>ster and Waller streets are in ecsta
cies of delight over the alleged secret
marriage of one of the belles of that sec
tion of the city to a young medical stu
dent. But the joy which attends the mas
tication of this choice morsel is not alto
gether unadulterated, because of the vig
orous, although rather coquettish, denial
of the supposed bride. Still the sight ot
an' angry brother tearing around the
neighborhood with blood in his eye and a
| miniature battery of artillery strapped to
j his person, breathing vengeance and
clamoring for a momentary glimpse of his
alleged brother-in-law in order that he
might perforate him with bullets, has, in
! a measure, atoned for the lack of details
\of the marriage ceremony. No blood has
been spilled up to date, for the very good
reason that the young man has gone into
the country for an indefinite visit, pre
sumably to avoid being made an unwill
subject for the Coroner, and the gossips
are talking more than ever and waiting
to see what the result will be when he
ventures to again put in an appearance on
the scene.
The heroine of the escapade is. or was.
Miss Florence Williamson, daughter of
the late Supervisor Williamson, who re
sides with her mother, brother and two
I sisters at 9S Webster street. The man in
the case is James Mahoney, a young med
ical student, residing at 115 "\\ ebster
street, who is employed, when he works,
in Martin's undertHking establishment on.
J Geary street, thereby adding to his
i knowledge of anatomy and his bank ac
count at one and the same time.
Young Mahoney was 21 years old last
Thursday and started in to celebrate the
event in a manner befitting the occasion.
]n the course of his mranderlngs he hap
! p*ned to meet Miss Williamson, whom he
i had known for several months.
"Suppose we get married?" he sug
gested.
I "All right; I'm willing." 1 replied the
young' lady with refreshing promptness?.
Straightway the pair hied them to "Cu
pid" Danforth and demanded a license.
As the bride-to-be admitted to having:
spent twenty-two summers on this terres
trial sphere the necessary document was
forthwith provided and the happy couple
departed, presumably to have the matri
monial knot securely tied without unne
cessary loss of time. Here all knowledge
of the double-headed celebration of Ma
honey's birthday ends, and whether the
couple were married or concluded to fore
go the ceremony until some future time
is merely conjecture. Mahoney has dis.
appeared and the young lady naively de
clares that she is still h maid.
Nevertheless the . publication of the
marriage license in the dally papers on
Friday caused an explosion in the Wil
liamson household which was heard for
blocks around, and while the neighbors
were wondering at the cause of the erup
tion Dr. William Williamson issued from
the front door armed to the teeth and
eager for a rhance to do battle with the
cause of his mental perturbation. He
raced over to the boarding-house which
had been the abiding place of Mahoney
and nearly frightened the landlady out
of a year's growth by demanding that
the youth be produced at once,, dead or
alive. He was finally convinced that the
object of his wrath was not in the house,
and departed to continue the search else
where. His efforts were unsuccessful, and
he was at last forced to return to his
house without having accomplished his
object.
Miss Williamson appears to regard the
whole affair as a joke, although she pos
itively declares that no marriage < ere
j mony, in which Bne figured as one of the
principals, has taken place. She was very
; much averse to being interviewed last
! night, and flitted in and out of the par-
I lor at her home like a will o' the wisp,
while being questioned.
"You must see my brother. T must re
fuse to talk," she said as she disappeared
Into the hall. A moment later she reap
peared.
"Will you deny that you are married?"
was asked.
"I will most grossly and blankly," she
replied, rather ambiguously, and the dis
appearing act was again successfully ac
complished.
Once more she fluttered into the room,
and, pointing to the photograph of a
rather handsome man on the piano, she
exclaimed: "There Is a picture of the man
I am engaged to. Dr. ." But her sister
put a sharp period to the Interviewing at
this stage, and the alleged bride made her
final exit from the scene.
Dr. Williamson, the brother, a veterin
ary surgeon, talked freely, but he evi
dently has recovered from his abnormal
thirst for gore, and Is now extremely
anxious to hush the matter up.
"There has been no marriage," he de
clared positively. "Mahoney is a nice
young: man and if he and Florence wanted
to get married they could have done so
without making any secret of it. They are
good friends but nothing more. In fact,
my sister is engaged to a very estimable
gentleman â a medical man, whose name I
am not at liberty to mention, as I do not
care to have him mixed up in this affair.
My sister had nothing to do with taking
out the marriage license and neither did
Mahoney. It was all a joke aimed at me [
by certain people, who have annoyed me j
in that manner before. While I am mor- I
ally certain who the parties are, I have no
proof, and therefore cannot give any
names. Mahoney has been in San Jose
for several days, and my sister has not
been out of the house since last Wednes
day, so you see they could not have been
at the marriage license office. A certain
young man went there and, representing
himself to be Mahoney, secured the li
rense and caused it to be published. I will
admit I was very much exercised over the !
affair when I first learned of the trick.
and they are talking about my going j
around gunning for Mahoney. I nevr j
carried a gun in my life, so that is ah- |
surd on the face of it. I have been both- j
ered to death by inquiries concerning my i
sister's supposed marriage, but, as I said ]
before, there is absolutely nothing in it."
Evidently "Brother Bill" does not keep
very close tab on the movements of his
sister, for notwithstanding his positive
statement that she was not out of the j
house on Thursday it is just as positively
known that she did mort Mahoney on the .
afternoon oi" that day ami went with him
to secure the license which has caused all
the turmoil. Miss Williamson is an attrac
tive young woman, and is said to possess
a small foVtune, inherited from her fathor.
Mahonoy is also said to b.e comfortably
fixed financially. It is said he was to re
ceive about $15,000 on his twenty-first
birthday, left him by an aunt, who died
several "years ago. but the tale lacks con
firmation. The young man's father ia

ANOTHER PIONEER
HAS PASSED AWAY
DEATH OF ALFRED A. GREEN, A
WAR VETERAN.
Was Instrumental in Defeating Sev
eral Fraudulent Land Grants in
Early Days of This City.
Alfred A. Grcon. a well-known uioneer,
passed away In this city on Friday even
ing last. His death was due to cancer
of the stomach, from which he had been
suffering' for a long time.
Mr. Green was one of the veterans of
the Mexican war and came to this city
as a member of Colonel Stevenson's regi
ment In 1847. He was clerk of the first
Town Council and member of the first
Legislature. Up was on the point of be
ing nominated for United States Senator
when he was called away to Mexico,
where he resided many year*.
Deceased was the original owner of the
Candelaria mine, and Colonel Ingersoll
passed the opinion a few years ago' that
the title was still vested in him and his
partners, Stevens and Burson. It was due
mainly to the efforts of Mr. Green that
the notorious Santillon grant, which cov
ered the public lands of this city, was de
feated. Through him also the La Abra
and "Weil claims were declared fraud
ulent. He obtained the evidence on which
Congress, after years of bitter warfare
on the part of the claimants, decided
against them.
He lectured throughout the United
States with General Caspar Sanchez
Oehia in the interests of Mexico and per-
formed valuable services for that coun
try. At the time of the French invasion
heowned extensive cotton plantations
which were destroyed. He filed a claim
for 1388,000, which was denied, presumably-
Because he refused to use questionable
lobbying taeti-s.
The San Rafael de la Zanza grant, one
of the richest in Arizona, belonged to
him. but is now in the possession of the
Camerons. relations of Senator Don
< ameron, who hold ir under contract and
will settle with his heirs when the contest
is decided by the land court of Arizona
AUrcd A* Green was born in Miramichi.
New Brunswick, upon a large grant given
to his grandfather. Senator Baxter, a roy
alist, who obtained large concessions from
the crown. His wife died one year ago,
and his remains will be buried with hers!
Deceased leaves four childrenâ Mrs. Sain
Shear. Mrs. William Henrty, Mrs. W. J
O'Brien and Alfred T. Greenâ and three
brothers- William H. Green of this city.

ASSAILANTS
ARE ARRESTED
Ballard and Edwards
Neatly Bagged.
:both notorious crooks
PLACED IN THE TANKS AT THE
CALIFORNIA STATION.
i
Detectives Gibson, Wren and HcMa
hon Cleverly Capture the Mea
Who Held Up a Sa
loon Keeper.
Frank Ballard and Harry Edwards,
two clever crooks, who have been under
the eyes of the police for some time,
were arrested last evening and their
names placed on the small book at the
California-street police station. The
crime of which the men are supposed
to be guilty is the robbing of John
Strothoff, a saloon-keeper at 45 Third
street, on Sunday, February 26, and
Detectives Ed Gibson, Ed Wren and
George McMahon, who made the arrest,
have what they believe Â£o be sufficient
evidence to secure a conviction.
Since the bold robbery a number of
the detectives in the Police Department
have been in search of the guilty par
ties, but -up to the latter part of last
week they were unable to find any
clews to the identity of the criminals.
Through private information, the
source of which they will not divulge,
Gibson, Wren and McMahon recently
learned who the men were, and a de
scription of them was given to all the
officers on the police force.
â  The detectives were not working on
the case last night particularly, but as
they -were passing the corner of Kearny
and California streets about 10 o'clock
they saw Ballard and Edwards within
I a stone's throw of the police station
| and it took but a few moments to place
them behind the bars. They will be
transferred to the Central Police Sta
tion to-day, when charges of robbery
will be placed against them.
Both of the men are well known to
the police. Ballard has served a term
in San Qurntin for burglary and Ed
wards, while he has never been con
victed, has been suspected a number of
times of being implicated in robberies
apd hold-ups. The Palace saloon on
Market street is a rendezvous of the
men, and this place has been watched
since it was learned that they Were
mixed up in the robbery, but they have
avoided the saloon.
The crime for Avhich Edwards and
Ballard have been arrested was one of
the most atrocious jobs that has been
brought to the notice of the Police
Department in many a day. Between
12 and 1 o'clock Sunday morning two
men entered a saloon at 45 Third
street, conducted by John Strothoff,
and ordered some beer. Strothoff was
just about to close up, but as the cus
tomers were well dressed and appar
ently respectable, the proprietor served
them with the liquor. He had just fin
ished counting his day's receipts, and
had put the money in the safe, which
was still open.
After having their first drink the men
called for another, but as Strothoff was
anxious to close up he refused to serve
them the liquor.
He came from behind the counter in
tending to turn out the gas, and as he
passed the ' two men one of them
grabbed him from behind and pinioned
his arms, while the other pressed a
handkerchief saturated with chloro
form to his nostrils. The saloon-keeper
was rr-ndered unconscious in a very few
moments. The bold thieves then helped
themselves to the contents of the safe.
Altogether they secured $96 in money
and a diamond pin. When Strothoff re
gained consciousness several hours
later he was seated in a chair in the
barroom.
The detectives are absolutely certain
that they have the right men. Ballard
was wanted by the police four months,
ago, he being implicated in the robbery
of Alex Brome!!, a wealthy Klondiker.
John Erickson and Maud Smith, who
assisted Ballard in this job, are
now serving eight years in San Quen
tin.
GREAT CARNIVAL OF
ELKS AT ST. LOUIS
LOCAL BRANCH MaKING AR
RANGEMENTS TO GO.
Announced That It Will Be the
Grandest Gathering in the His
tory of the Organization.
The Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks throughout the I'nited States are
making preparations for the grandest car
nival cvor given in the history of the
order. It will be the Grand Lodge meet
ing and annual reunion at St. Louis, Mo.,
commencing June 20 and lasting until
June 23.
A striking circular lately issued by the
St. Louis branch, who are arranging the
preliminaries for the entertainment of the
delegates to the convention, announces a
"purple week." Twelve thousand dollars
in cash prizes will be awarded, four times
as much as the largest prize list ever
offered, for various forms of competition
among tlie lodges and members in attend
ance, and $1750 in prizes to bands accom
panying the visiting lodges. Low rate
excursions are being arranged "to the
mountains, to the Great Lakes and on
the Great River," which will leave St.
Louis after the festivities are over.
The circular continues in the following
merry strain, and gives one an idea of
what the Elk may expect should he visit
St. Ivouis during carnival week:
"We have $18.00" just 'to blow in' to
make everybody have a good time and go
away saying we are the best people on
earth. Don't be afraid of cold weather:
we'll make it warm for you. We told you
we would do it and we wfll."
San Francisco Lodge No. 3. thn local
branch, will send a representation to the
convention. H. S. Manning, present ex
alted ruler, will be elected delegate and he
will be accompanied by J. O. Reis, James
P. Dunne and Past Exalted Ruler J. R.
Howell. It is the intention to charter a
special car, and there will be delegates
from Chieo, Sacramento. Stockton, Oak
land, Fresno, Los Angeles. San Diego and
probably Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo.
There will be over three hundred and
fifty lodges represented by their exalted
rulers. In addrtion to these there will be
other delegates who may take part in the
deliberations, but will have no voice in
the deciding of constitutional question*.
The business convention will last four
days and will be presided over by Grand
Exalted Ruler John Galvln. The last
three Grfind Lodge meetings have been
held in Cincinnati. Minneapolis and New
Orleans, respectively, and were elaborate
affairs.
The drill corps of the different lodges
will be made a special feature, and prizes
wnl be given to the most, expert. The
lodge sending the largest number of dele
gates will also be rewarded. In fact
prizes will be given for all sorts of prop
ositions.

THE CITY BOARD
OF HEALTH AND
THE QUARANTINE
What Will It Do With
Dr. Chalmers?
YEARLY COST OF THE PERKINS
CAPTAIN LANE AND THE OBE
DIENT SENTRY.
Four Overdue Vessels "Upon Which
Beinsurance Has Been Paid.
Sailing of the Trans
ports.
City Quarantine Officer Chalmers sails
out on the bay and boar&s the incoming
ships, but he might as well stay up in
the City Hall and entertain the Health
Officer with stories of his wild cruisings.
The doctor carefully inspects the new ar
rivals at the harbor gates and tells them
whether they can come in or not. but he
has no more authority to do so than one
of the sweepers on the water front. Three
Superior Judges of this county have de
clared In effect that there Is only one
quarantine officer for this port and he is
Dr. M. J. Rosenau of the Marine Hospital.
So the Federal quarantine man has ex
clusive jurisdiction.
In the meantime the Board of Health
of this city is asking itself what is to be
done, regardless of the fact that there is
nothing to be done except lay the State
quarantine tug Governor Perkins up ami
discharge the Quarantine Officer and the
crew. Dr. Chalmers gets $150; Captain W.
H Milestone of the tug, $100; Engineer J.
C. Cousins, $100; Deckhand Clem Johnson,
$75; Louis Jones, a messenger for some
body, $75. The abolition of these posi
tions would save $500 per month and the
discontinuance of the tug in a useless ser
vice would save In coal and other running
expenses about $750, or a total of some
! thing like $1200 per month. If the State
Supreme Court says the city quarantine
service is not needed then the city may
save $14,400 a year by letting it go.
Dr. J. M. Williamson, chairman of the
auarantine department of the Board of
Health, stated yesterday in an interview
that the present bill before the Legisla
ture to abolish the San Francisco Quar
antine Office and establish a State office
would place the service on a stronger and
more satisfactory footing. This has been
done at New York and New Orleans, and
there the State quarantine officers have
successfully held their own in desperate
warfare with the Federal officers. If the
bill does not pass. Dr. "Williamson thinks
the only course left for the city is to ap
peal to the United States Supreme Court
form the decision of Judges Cook. Dunne
and Lawlor, or abolish the service. The
doctor holds that if uhe bill becomes a
law its passage will not end the fight be
tween the city and the Federal Govern
ment; it will only make the State a party
in the warfare, which hardly settleÃ
peacefully the old painful question.

Captain Lane of the steamer Valencia
was refused admittance to his own vessel
yesterday morning. A young second lieu
tenant just from west Point came down
to Folsom-street dock with a squad of
soldiers, and, s?eeing a number of people In
common, everyday civilian clothes moving
up and down the gangplank, concluded
that was not war and placed a sentry
with musket and bare bayonet on the
wharf. The first civilian that found that
bayonet jammed against his breast pocket
was Captain Lane. . In vain he tried to
convince . the military man that he was
.the master of that crait, iuid .virtually
independent of the United States army.
The soldier was there to oboy orders, and
not even the captain of the ship could
walk up the gangplank. Nothing could
he dono till the young officer came around
and Captain Lane ku on the wharf
Stringer alongside his ship till he was re
li< yea from his predicarrn-nt. The lieuten
ant was somewhat surprised to learn that
steamships have captains and other peo
ple who "are necessary on board and do
not wear natty military uniforms. The
orders to the sentry wore changed.
The entire Market-street car system
was tied up yesterday, and the stationary
coaches reached in an unbroken string
from the ferry to Kearny street. The
grip of Haight-street car 153 crashed into
the bumper at the ferry turntable, and
the floor of the dummy was wrecked. As
the grip struck the bumper it was
wrenched from the gripman's hands and
dragged down on the track under the
car with a force almost overturning the
coach. A wrecking gang of men worked
industriously for an hour before the road
was clear.
The Valencia will get away for Manila
this afternoon and the Cnnemaugh some
time this week. Over 4'"X) tons of quarter
master and commissary stores will soon
be purchased for shipment to the Philip
pines. This is much more than Folsom
street wharf will hold, and the question
of dock space is growing more trouble
some. When the Government begins to
look around for transportation for the six
regiments to Manila there "will be a call
for steamers.
The French Consul visit.d the lowa yes
terday. and was received -with a salute of
seven" guns. To-nr.r will be general visit-
Ing time to the big battleship, and Cap
tain Henry Peterson will run three steam
launches out to the vessel.
Mike de Pangher, thp invalid baseball
player, will be given a benefit at Recrea
tion Park, Eighth and Harrison streets,
this afternoon.

GOLD FOUND ON
TAHKIN CREEK
Large Field Opened to
Miners.
PROSPECTOR'S RICH STRIKE
PORCUPINE DISTRICT ANOTHER
KLONDIKE.
Excitement at Juneau Over the Lat
est Discovery Made on the
American Side of
the Line.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 22.â A new
strike in the Porcupine district has ex
cited people here. P. N. McGuire came
down from the Tah-kin two days ago
with about $4 worth of coarse gold in
a bottle. McGuire is the man who
found a fair prospect on a bar of the
Taku River, along which runs the trail
of the same name, last summer. The
prospect on the Tahkin is so much bet
ter, considering first results, that Mc-
Guire will abandon the Taku, for the
time being at least, and stick to the
Tahkin. This creek flows into the
Chilkat r" at twelve 'miles from
Haines Mission, on the left-hand side
of the river.
McGuire dug a hole in the snow, cut
wood, thawed the ground, and-, with
snow melted into water, claims to have
taken out of the hole, within two feet
of the surface, the $4 in dust in a day
and a half. This was a most laborious
and tedious process. Under ordinary
circumstances the returns ought to be
ten or twelve times that amount, that
is, with the snow off and with a sluice
box and plenty of water to work with.
McGuire exhibited the gold in the
Franklin Hotel. There were several
men in his party and all told the same
story. He lives on Douglas Island,
where he worked in the Treadwell mine
for a while and is considered a reliable
man.
If this gold came from a single pros
pect hole sunk only a short distance
below the surface it is a most extraor
dinary find. Proportionately it is the
richest yet struck in the entire Chilkiit
or Porcupine country. The Tahkin is |
not properly in the Porcupine district.
It is only a few hours' travel up the
Chilkat or Dalton trail. Every foot of
ground in the creek has been staked.
A rush followed the discovery. Scores
of men are tramping over the snow in
that region, looking for other creeks,
and from the nature of reports ever
since the original Porcupine was first i
staked they will in all probability be j
found. Many miners can b<_- found who i
say the Chilkat country is going to
prove to be the best placer mining
country and camp yet found in Alaska, j
Nobody expects it will be as rich in
spots as the Klondike creeks, but the
dust seems to be there in paying quan
tities, spread over a country the goM
bearing area of which is not yet known.
Haines Mission has already grown
from a village in short skirts into a
flourishing maindenhood. Bunkhouses
and restaurants are springing up on
every hand. Stores and saloons are ap
pearing along the trail. There are two
to three steamboats each way daily
from Juneau and Hkaguay, and already
there is a law suit over the townsite.
At the present rate of growth in three
or four weeks the place will look less \
like a missionary post than anything in
Alaska. The whole country back of it,
except beyond the divide, is in Ameri- |
can territory, in Alaska proper, and
claims are 1500 feet square, or about
twenty acres in area. Consequently if
there is any gold in the ground at all
there ought to be a comfortable sum
in a twenty-acre gravel field.
E. P. Cronin, a Black Hills miner of
the '76 rush, who has Just returned here
from Porcupine, says:
"It is undoubtedly the mining camp
of Alaska. I prospected several creeks
east of Porcupine and found gold in
every one of them. The best
prospects I found were on
Trail Creek, a tributary of the
Tahkin. Repeated pannings on the
surface gave an average of from 6 to 8
cents to the pan, and at a depth of
three feet as high as 25 cents was
panned out. From five to fifteen colors
to the pan were found in the gravel
bar at the mouth of the Tahkin. and
this bar is about forty feet deep. There
may be some trouble from water there.
Ahkuk Creek, a tributary of Chilkat
Lake, also prospects well. Other creeks
in this locality, I have been told, show
up as well/]
NEW DIRECTORS HAVE
NO LEGAL STANDING
Union Savings Bank Management
Awaits Confirmation by the
Court.
BAN JOSE, March 4.â The Union Sav
ings Bank directorate, as now constituted,
has discovered it has no legal standing,
and will hold no more meetings until the
members shall have been appointed and
confirmed by the court. This afternoon
the directors invited Attorney General
Ford to confer with them on Monday aft
ernoon in regard to bank affairs. At that
time It is proposed to have the Superior
Court recognize the board as now reor
ganized.
Nothing has been done yet to give the
depositors representation in the directory.
F. W. Potter was to have been elected as
their representative, but a question has
arisen as to whether stock can now be
transferred to him. Tt is said that even
those who have been selected for the new
board may be ignored by the court and
that other names will be put forward for
directors. .-â *.â¢_.Â«
The ownership of the fruit in the Soro
sis Company warehouse was discussed to
day. Both Howard and the Sorosis people
claim some $30,000 worth of dried fruit. It
is being disposed of by the company, but
the bank has decided to take no steps to
stop this, as the corporation is responsible
for such sum.
There is a lively fight on for the receiv
ership of the bank, P. P. Austin. T. F.
Morrison and about a half-dozen being in
the race. _.

PANAMA, Colombia, March 4.â The
Herald's correspondent in Quito tele
graphs that President Aifaro of Ecua
dor has issued a proclamation granting
amnesty to rebels who shall lay down
their arms within thirty days. Those
not complying with this proclamation
will be regarded as outlaws and ene
mies of the Government, and will be
treated as such. Amnesty is not to
include leaders, chiefs and officers of
the rebellion.
The Government offers $6 for each
Mannlicher rifle surrendered and for
each rifle of other patterns.
News has reached Quito that Gen
eral Arellano, commander of the Gov
ernment forces in the north, has made
a triumphant entry into Tulcan. the
rebel stronghold. His troops marched
in and were greeted with enthusiasm
by the people, who turned out en
masse.
I learn on good authority that Vice
President Billinghurst of Peru has been
chosen to go to Ecuador on a special
diplomatic mission of a delicate nature.
Since tho retirement of Senor Enriaue
Bustamente Salazar from the Peruvian
legation at Quito his country has been
represented only by Senor Augustin
Blanco Azcona, Charge d'Affaires. Re
lations between the countries has been
somewhat strained, owing, I am in
formed, to the connivance of the au
thorities of Piura, Peru, in repeated
invasions of Ecuador by Ecuadorian
rebels from that department.

Rupture Was Cured
Five Years Ago the Experiment
Was Tried.
No Doubt But What the Cure Is
Permanent.
In the early part of isr>3 J. D. Thompson of
Cnstorlanrl. X. V.. was attracted by the news-
paper announcement that Dr. W. S. Rice of
418 T. Main St., Adams, N. V., had perfected a
MR. J. P. THOMPSON.
new and marvelous cure for rupture. Mr.
Thompson had a rupture that the various kinds
of trusses on the market wouldn't hold, so he
communicated with Dr. Rice and began treat-
ment immediately. He wa.>s cured so completely
as to upset all former theories regarding the
treatment of ninture and for the past five
years has been as sound as a dollar. This fact
is worthy of publication since there are thou-
sands of sufferers who honestly believe they
cannot be cured. Write to Dr. Rice and he will
send you free a book that describes this grand
treatment,
It is a home cure at small cost, painless,
harmless, without operation or loss of an hour
from work. It cures man, woman or child,
and no matter how bad the rupture may be the
cure is quick, complete and permanent. If you
are ruptured do not neglect this notice of the
Rice rr.ethnd of cure. It is the recording of
facts like the above that make our newspapers
of such value to us. Write at once for Dr.
Rice's book, and if you know of any one else
who is ruptured it will be an act of kindness to
see that they also learn about the marvelous
Dr. Rice system. Write to-day.

date and a total for the season up to that

much of the later sown grain is looking
unusually well, and with rains during this

The insurance is $3000. The fire is sup
posed to have been of incendiary origin.
It started in the dining room, in which
there had been no fire the previous day.

PECULIAR POISONS.
GENERATED IN THE HUMAN BODY.
The Result of Imperfect Digestion of
Fooi.
Every living thing, plant or animal, con-
tains within itself the germs of certain
decay and death.
In the human body these germs of
death (called by scientists Ptomaines) are
usually the result of imperfect digestion
of food, the result of indigestion or dys-
pepsia. ;-/â ,â â¢ -i
The stomach, from abuse, weakens,
does not promptly and thoroughly digest
the food. The result is a heavy, sodden
mass, which ferments (the first process of
decay), poisoning the blood, making it
thin, weak and lacking in red corpus-
cles, poisoning the brain, causing head-
aches, pain in the eyes.
Bad digestion weakens the heart, caus-
ing palpitation and finally bringing on
disease of this very important organ.
Poor digestion poisons the kidneys,
causing Bright's disease and diabetes.
And this is so because every organ,
every nerve, depends upon the stomach
alone for nourishment and renewal, and
weak digestion shows itself not only in
loss of appetite and flesh, but in weak
nerves and muddy complexion.
The great English scientist, Huxley,
said the best start in life is a sound
stomach. Weak stomachs fail to digest
food properly, because they lack the
proper quantity of digestive acids (lactic
and hydrochloric), and peptogenic prod-
ucts. The most sensible remedy in all
cases of indigestion is to take after each
meal one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, because they supply in a pleas-
ant, harmless form all the elements that
weak stomachs lack.
The regular use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will cure any form of stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.
They increase flesh, insure pure blood,
strong nerves, bright eyes and clear com-
plexion, because all these result only from
wholesome food well digested.
Nearly all druggists sell Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets at 50 cents full-sized
packages, or by'mail by inclosing price to
Stuart Company, Marshall, Mich., but ask
your drupjrist first. A little book on stom- i
ach diseases mailed free. Address Stuart

Defendant's Expert in Brandes Mur

Marks.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â â¢roadway. March 4.
Dr. E. H. Woolsey, chief medical ex
pert for the defense in Brandes' murder
sensation at the District
office this afternoon by charg
ing in an offhand manner that the photo
graphs showing the marks, Sruises and
discoloration s on Lillian Brandes' body, j
i xhiblted before the jury, had been doc- j
tared in retouching.
The remark was promptly resented by !
E. R. Jackson, the official photographer,
with District Attorney Allen, his
deputy, Harry Melvln, and J. E. :
Bennett, one of tht- attorneys for t
was pr< sent at the time. Jackson
tie very indignant uver the Imputa
nnd his reply to the aged doctor
1 the latter to leave the omce very
much wrought up and talking of re
venge.
Mr. Jackson was prepared for such j
charges and had in his possession the neg- '
s from which the photographs were
printed, and when Dr. Woolsey wished to
handle these Mr. Jackson's distrust as- j
serted itseif and he vigorously refused to
allow Dr. Woolsey to touch them. This
action resulted in the defense's chief ex
pert flushing up with rage-.
By ieason of tho controversy it is quite !
likely thai Brandes 1 trial will be protract- j
ed by augmenting the list of experts al- |
ready called, for no doubt experts on I
photography will now be subpenaed.
whol< dispute arises out of the fart
that the bruises and marks on the dead j
girl's body, as they appear in the photos, '
â¢ 11 defined and their edges terminate j
abruptly. Bruises of that nature are ad- ;
mitted by all the exports that have thus |
far testified to be such as are produced
death, while post-mortem marks i
<5o not end abruptly, but their discolora
tions are more extensive and fade grad
ally toward their termination.
Dr. Woolsey viewed the remains of
the dead girl while they were lying at the
[â¢taking parlor in Berkeley Just prior
to their burial, when the body was dese
crated by the removal of the skull and
membranes. He has stated under oath
that those marks were post-mortem.
Mr. Jackson's photographs clearly con

WATER FIGURES
FOR COUNCILMEN
TO MANIPULATE
Two Schedules Sub
mitted Last Night.
ROOM FOR WARM FIGHTING'
THE ''SOLID SIX" WERE NOT j
PROMINENT.
Earl Submits a Long Array of Prices
and Offers a Resolution That
Will Doubtless Meet With
Strong Opposition.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. March 4.
A comparison of the water ordinances
for the past four years shows that more
ingenuity can be rut into a schedule regu
lating water rates than almost any other
document on earth. The ordinance passed
by the Non-Partisan Council in 1595 is tho
ktweÃt ever heard of. It places the rate
for a house not occupying more than 400
square feet, of one story, at 30 cents. The
ordinance for 1897 gave such a house 31
cents, ana the ordinance of last year,
about which all tho trouble occurred,
piaced the same sized house at 25 cents.
It is not in the ground area of houses
that the rates cut any figure. It is in
the additional charges made for every
purpose to which water can be put. As a
matter of fact, the 25 cents ia merely for
drinking water, and at meter rates would
permit any one drinking or using for cook
ing purpos( s 1250 gallons per month.
The Non-Partisan ordinance, as that of
l-'T is known, only produces about three
fifths of the income which would be ob
tained from the IS9B ordinance, and yet
the lS:ts ordinance Is said by water com
panies to be actually lower than its pre
decessor.
It is difficult for one not acquainted with
the manner in which such documents are
juggled to get any understanding or sat
isfaction from an Oakland water-rate
schedule. To look at last year's ordi
nance, a man with a medium-sized house
of two stories would find that his bill
should be $1 50. In fact, he finds it to be
about $4. and on looking further along in
the ordinance he discovers that he ha.s to
pay fvji each bathtub, for each drain
closet, for window washing, irrigating
lawns, closets, washing sidewalks, for
horses, cows, and also for a permanent
boarder.
The inequality of this ordinance in one
respect can be seen at a glance. The rate
for a family of ten persons in any house
is less than* the rate for two persons who
may have a permanent boarder, there be
ing no limit to the term "single, family."
The Non-Partisan ordinance took it for
granted that there would be al least one
Bath and closet in an ordinary house and
did not make an extra cnarge for it. It
â¢ â¢ xcd the rates for hydrants at $1 75
per month. The ordinance of last year
doubled this allowance for hydrants, and
in addition the city pays for placing and
repairing them. These figures compared
with the ordinance, which will be intro
duced next Monday night, will give an
Idea of what water users may expect to
pay after June 30.
Something has evidently gone wrong
with the programme of the "solid six"
in regard to fixing water rates. There is a
vast difference between the ideas of some
members of the six a year ago and now.
At to-night's meeting of the Water Com
mittee of the City Council there was a
bare quorum, but there were some sur
prises.
Councilman Earl presented an ordinance
that was mainly remarkable for the con
tract regarding fire hydrants, when com
pared with last year's. Earl's ordinance
only allows $1 75 for each hydrant, and
requires the corporation to place and keep
them in repair. Last year Mr. Ear!
worked and voted for an ordinance that
gnve the company $3 50 per hydrant and
required that the city pay for all repairs.
Mr. T'pton introduced an ordinartre that
cutsthe hydrant rate of last year c<*isider
ably. but'which ia much higher than Earl's
ordinance, fixing it at $2 75. Councilman
Upton's ordinance makes no changes In
the ground area rates from those now
( â xiFtir.g for house.-- and dwellings occu
pied by a single family, and public and
private buildings not Including other spe
cified rates. Where the dwelling is occu
pied by more than one family the rate
for each additional family is 30 per cent
of those rates; for churches and halls
used for religious purpose? 50 per cent
of the present rates; for water used in
public and private schools, slaughter
nouses, breweries, and for other purposes
not specially rated In the area schedule
and requiring large quantities of water
the following meter rate is urged by Tjp
ton.
For the first 2000 -cubic feet used per
month, 26 cents per hundred cubic feet;
for the next :!000 cubic feet. 24 cents per
hundred cubic feet; for the next 5000 cubic
22 cents: the next 10.000. 21 cents, and
20 cents per hundred cubic feet for water
used in excess of 20,000 cubic feet per
month The minimum meter rate is given
as $1 25. Water used for street sprinkling
to be charged according to the foregoing
meter rates, and the same for flushing
and cleaning sewers.
Councilman Earl' 3 ordinance would
raise the rate on ground area tor dwell
ings ocupied by a single family, varlous
lv from 21 to 40 per cent, and on larger
houses not more than from 3 to 10 per
cetif for irigation of lawns and gardens
a charge of 3 mills per square yard per
month; for horses kept in private stab c.
including water for washing one vehicle,
30 cents the same in livery stables 2o
cents- for each car, stage, saddle or draft
horse 20 cents: cow, 10 cents. In Earl's
ordinance the meter rate is fixed at the
flat rate of 20 cents per 1000 gallons.
Councilman Earl also introduced a reso
lution fixing the water rates in accordance
with his ordinance. Ordinances require
the Mayor's signature, whereas resolu
tions do not ,and water rates can be
established either by resolution or ordi
nance There were but three members of
the Water Committee present at the
meeting to-night, and both ordinances
were referred to the City Council without
recommendation.

BURNED BY
AN EXPLOSION
OF COAL OIL
Mrs. T. O. Crawford Is
in Grave Danger.
HOME TOTALLY DESTROYED!
FURNITURE AND LIBRARY ALSO
IN ASHES.
The County School Superintendent
Had Left Home Only a Few
Minutes Before the Acci
cident Occurred.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. March 4.
Mrs. T. O. Crawford, wife of the County
Superintendent of Schools, is hovering be
tween life and death at Fabiola Hospital,
and the Crawford home at Fruitvale is in
ruins, because of an. explosion of coal oil
this morning..
Mrs. Crawford was pouring coal oil
from one vessel into another near a fire.
The fumes reached the flames, the explo
sion followed, and Mrs. Crawford was in
stantly surrounded by fire. The only
other occupant of the house at the time
was Mrs. Stoddard, mother of Mrs. Craw
ford, who is a feeble old lady and utterly
unable to render any assistance in such
an emergency. Mrs. Crawford was so
overcome by "the fumes that she was un
able to hem herself, and it was only
when the residents in the Reno house,
adjoining, noticed smoke coming from the
windows and doors that they knew of the
accident.
As the Renos rushed into the house they
encountered Mrs. Stoddard, so overcome
with nervousness that she could not tell
them what had happened; but a look in
at the room where Mrs. Crawford was
enveloped in flames at once revealed the
cause of the fire. Every effort was made
to extinguish the flames around the un
fortunate woman, and after this was done
and she wns taken to a neighbor's house
attention was turned to the burning build
ing, from which fire was issuing in half a
dozen places. , ,
Mrs. Crawford was afterward taken to
Fabiola Hospital, and the doctors are. un
phle to s-iy what may be the result of her
fearful injuries. Fully one-half of her
entire body was burned In some degree.
The Fruitvale Hook and Ladder Com
pany went to the fire, but having no en
gine could do little. The Reno home was
also burning in one corner, but a garden
hose and a good deal of energy put out
the flames and saved the house. The ac
cident occurred shortly after Superin
tendent Crawford and his daughter had
left home for his office. Their home, fur
niture and library are a complete loss.

WON'T BE EVEN
"SISTERS" TO
THE BACHELORS
Young Ladies Hot at
the Ex-Club.
BUT CLYDE CONKEY IS FIRM
" r
SAYS HE WILL BEMAIN LOYAL
TO CELIBACY.
The Other Ex-Members Will at Once
Propose Marriage to Square
Themselves With Scorn
ful Beauty.
ALAMEDA, March 4.-The young ladies
of Alameda are not in a frame of. mind
to forgive the members of the Bachelors
Club. Even the dissolution of the organ
ization, which took place to-night, and
the unconditional surrender of the club,
may avail the members nothing. At this
date the young ladies refuse to even be
sisters to the young men who, in a
thoughtless moment, entered into an anti
matrimonlal compact.
All the bachelors but one are penitent.
The remorseful ones agree with President
Dr W R. Hughes that " 'Tis not well to
live alone." The exception is Bachelor
Clyde Conkey, treasurer of the club. He
has protested emphatically against the
disbandment of the organization and In
sists that it is against the future happi
ness of the members to release them from
their anti-matrimonial agreements in
his present frame of mind there will be a
bachelors' club in this city if he ia the
only member. . . .. â.
Other bachelors of the organization that
passed out of existence to-night assert it
was not Mx. Conkey's fault that he did
not break the anti-marriage contract
when it was in force. It is stated that his
protestations of everlasting affection were
spurned by some of the young ladies who
now refuse to forgive the bachelors.
"This is the secret of Mr. Conkey s firm
stand against matrimony and the dissolu
tion of the Bachelors' Club," said one of
the most penitent members. Secretary 11.
L. Zimmerman. "I truly hope he will see
the error Of his ways before it is too late.
If he- does not and insists upon being a
bachelors' club all by himself I hope the
young ladies will not hold the rest of us
responsible for his actions. He is a good
hearted young gentleman, and would
make an ideal husband if he will only lay
aside his prejudices against the fairer sex.
He will puffer if he does not. The six
months during which I lived up to the
rules of the Bachelors' Club was the most
lonesome, desolate period of my exist
ence. I want no more of it."
The final meeting of the club was held
this evening at the home of Bachelor J.
H. Wittich, 1603 Walnut street. Despite
the protest of Bachelor Conkey a motion
prevailed to adjourn the organization sine
die. Bachelor Al Behneman sprung a sur
prise in tho shape of an agreement binding
j the signers to propose marriage to some
I Alameda young lady within the coming
: six months. With the single exception of
j the member of the new anti-matrimonial
club all present signed the agreement.
After the business meeting the ex-bach
elors discussed an elaborate banquet. Dr.
W. R. Hughes acted in the capacity of
toastmaster, and In his introductory re
marks stated that he hoped the experience
of the past six months would be a valu
able lesson to the members.
A GIFT WITH A STBING TO IT.
Alameda Will Not Accept a Building
Offered for a Hospital.
ALAMEDA, March 4. â From present in
dications it is not likely that Alameda will
have a receiving hospital unless It con
structs one itself. The offer of the
Woman's Exchange to give its building
! to the city for the purpose stated had a
1 string tied to it. Upon the recommenda
! tion of the Board of Health the offer was
' accepted by the City Trustees, but it now
appears that the exchange wants some
assistance in return for the proffered
gift, and the city authorities do not see
the matter that way.
The ladies of the exchange desire to go
out of business and disincorporate. The
legal expenses would be in the neighbor
hood of $30, which the members think the
I city ought to pay. The Board of Health
: has been doing some figuring on the mat-
I ter. They find that if the exchange
building is accepted it will cost several
hundred dollars to move it to the city's
lot and fit it up properly. With a little
additional outlay a new building design
ed for use as an hospital could be con
structed. Th 4 latter plan may be adopted.
The city's new ambulance is completed
' and will "go into commission March 20.

CHILDS KNOCKS
OUT ARMSTRONG
Colored Championship
Decided.
FIERCE FIGHT AT CINCINNATI
BIGHT SWING ENDS THE MILL
IN THE SIXTH.
Large Crowd of Sports Attends and
the Chicago Contingent Wins
Heavily on Its
Man.
Special D'spatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, March 4.â A ten-round
contest for the colored heavy-weight
championship of the world was the
main event to-night before the Stagg
Athletic Club. The contestants for the
honor once held by Peter Jackson were
Bob Armstrong of New York and
Frank Childs of Chicago. The men met
in Chicago about two years ago and
Childs gained the decision in the sec
ond. Armstrong claimed, however, that
the contest was prearranged and that
Childs took advantage of an opening,
thereby gaining the decision over him.
The contest to-night assumed cham
pionship airs, a large delegation being
present from Indianapolis, St. Louis,
Cleveland, Louisville and Chicago. An
extra attraction was the presence of
Tom Sharkey and hie manager, Tom
O'Rourke. The men fought for a divi
sion of the receipts, which reached the
thousands, owing to the prices, which
were from $1 to $25.
Armstrong's seconds were Tom Shar
key and Tom O'Rourke. Childs was
looked after by Connolly, Sara Sum
mers and George "Washington. Shar
key received an ovation, and in re
sponse to the cries for a speech said
he was grateful for the reception. In
regard to a fight with Fitzsimmons, he
declared he had posted $1000 with a
New York paper to bind the fight with
the champion.
Armstrong and Childs shook hands
at 10 p. m. Johnny Murphy of Cin
cinnati was chosen referee. Armstrong
towered over his stockily built oppon
ent. He resorted to left hand leads in
the first round, invariably receiving a
right counter from Childs.
In the second round Armstrong was
the aggressor, but a hard counter on
the jaw staggered him and worried
him r-xtrerncly. Childs rushed and re
ceived a right uppercut on the face.
At close quarters Armstrong had the
advantage. Childs rushed matters in
the third and in a mix-up he floored
Armstrong with a right swing on the
jaw. Armstrong took nine seconds of
the count. Upon rising ho managed
to keep clear of his smaller opponent,
who forced him around the ring, vainly
trying to land a knockout.
The fourth round was a furious one,
Childs being staggered by a right on
the head, while evidently holding back
for a chance, to land his right.
In the fifth Childs rushed and landed
right and left repeatedly, driving Arm-
I strong around the ring. Armstrong's
replies were with right and left jaba.
A hard right swing on the jaw stagger
ed Armstrong, and Childs, following it
up. landed left and right, which made
Armstrong very groggy.
In the sixth Ohilds rushed at Arm
strong and landed a hard right swing
on the jaw', which sent Armstrong fly
ing clear across the ring. But for the
ropes he would have tipped headlong
among the spectators. As he rebound
ed from the ropes. Childs landed his
i right again on the jaw. which sent
Armstrong reeling about the ring with
his hands hanging by his side. Childs
was about to give the finishing punch
when O'Rourke, realizing that his man
was helpless, threw up the sponge and
the colored heavyweight championship
was awarded to Childs.
The Chicago contingent won a large
' sum of money on the contest.
After the fight was over O'Rourke
and others held a conference on a pro
i position that Sharkey challenge Childs.
The winner to-night developed such
surprising parts that Sharkey agrees
to meet him soon.

His Essence of Truth.
For many years the sage held to his in
vestigations. He sat at his desk in the
library with tomes (whatever in the world
they are) heaped all about him. He un
rolled manuscripts and studied them in
deep abstraction. He turned the pages of
many books. At intervals he would nod
solemnly and make a note on the sheet
of paper lying in front of him. At last
the frail body weakened under the strain
of unremitting toil. The ancient scholar
took to his bed.
"The end Is near," said the physician,
holding the thin, worn hand in his so that
he might lend the old student some of hia
own courage.
"I care not," whispered the sage, with
a smile of resignation. "My work is fin
ished. I have proved itâ as I said. On
my desk in the library. You will lind it
there."
When his spirit had departed the life
long friend who had been chosen as ex
ecutor went to the library.
There, upon the :*rewn desk, he found
the fruits of all the labor, the essence of
Truth which the scholar had extracted
by years of reading and research. There
was the Finished Work. It was as fol
"If 'honey' did not rhyme with 'money'
and 'Lou' with "you," there never could
have been any 'coon' songs."â Chicago
Record.
The Parlor Lamp.

How do you light It?"

GOOD WORK OF
THE CALIFORNIANS
Delegation Did Well for
the State.
APPROPRIATIONS SECURED
WHITE SAVED RIVER AND HAR
BOR BILL FROM DEFEAT.
Perkins, Loud, Hilborn, De Vries,
Barham and Barlow Also Joined
in Securing Needed Leg
islation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel.
Washington, March 4.
It is not generally known that Sen
ator White of California brought about
the adoption of the Nicaragua canal
substitute provision, which not only
saved the river and harbor bill from
utter defeat, but secured a compromise
on the Nicaragua canal project. Sen
ator White was strongly in favor of
the canal bill; but after consultation
with conferees on the part of the
House realized they would never yield,
so rather than jeopardize California's
prospect of securing $1,250,000 In the
river and harbor bill he interceded with
his colleagues on the Commerce Com
mittee, Morgan and Frye, and the re
sult was the adoption of Burton's com
promise provision providing 51.000.ikj0
for preliminary work and committins:
this Government in favor of construc
tion.
The Californians, as a rule, are well
pleased with the result of their labors.
They not only secured large appropria
tions for the removal of Arch and Shas
rocks in San Francisco Bay, but for
the improvement of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rlveie, Humboidt and
San Pedro harbors, Alviso channel,
provisions for public buildings at Oak
land, Los Angeles and Stockton: for
protection of Yosemite Park, for light
stations and revenue cutters; Goat
Island naval training station, apd a
number of lesser appropriations.
Each member of the delegation is en
titled to credit for the work performed;
Loud for appropriations for Shag and
Arch rocks and Alviso channel; Hil
born, Oakland postoffice; De Vrles. Sac
ramento and San Joaquin improve
ments, Stockton postoffice and Yosem
ite Park appropriations; Barham, for
Humboidt harbor, and Barlow, for Los
Angeles postoffice.
Too much credit, however, cannot be
given Senators Perkins and White, who
labored zealously, and are entitled to
share the honors accruing to the rep
resentatives, individually and collec
tively. On the whole, the California
delegation pulled as much "pork" out
of Uncle Sam's barrel as any delega
tion in Congress?, and each member
leaves for home well satisfied.
The bills of special importance that
failed were the Pacific cable, arid lands,
reservoirs and mineral lands bills.
De Vries has organized a campaign for
the next Congress and feels certain that
the mineral lands bill will pass at next
winter's session.
QUEER WORK FOR WOMEN.
Bemarkable Varfc ;y Shown in the
Applications at an Exchange.
"I'd like to write verses to order." said
a little woman the other day, taking her
stand In front of the desk of the manager
of an exchange for woman's work.
"Hey?" questioned the manager, look-
Ing up from the letter she was reading.
"I said I'd like to write verses to or
der â for birthday parties, luncheons and
dinners," the little woman repeated. "My
husband Is sick, and the doctors say
thatâ that," here there was a little break
In her voice, "he'll always be an invalid,
so I've got to earn some money to take
care of him and help educate our chil
dren."
"And you wish to write verses." The
manager was puzzled. "Well, you see,
we are not a publishing house nor a â "
"Oh, yes. I know: but you don't under
stand. I don't write poetry â only rhymes
and doggerel. The kind one sends with
birthday presents or puts on a luncheon
card. That's what I want to do. I have
been doing it all my life for my frunds
for nothing; just whenever they wanted
anything of that kind they'd call on me.
Now that I have to earn money I
thought you might find some persons who
were willing to pay for them. I can do
them on any subject, and bring In any
peculiarity or characteristic they want."
The manager was about to reply when
a woman who had been seated in the of
lice got up and came forward.
"She's just the one I want." she said
hurriedly, her cheeks pink from excite
ment- "My daughter is going to have a
Valentino luncheon next week, and two
weeks later is her birthday, and I am
thinking: Â«f giving her a dinner. I would

that after an oyster ha 3 passed the four

being eaten just after celebrating theii
thirtieth birthday, ami in most cases thej
formed a delicious meal. Thirty is an un
usual age for an. oyster to attain, be
cause few are given an opportunity tc

COUNTY OFFICIALS WILL
ATTACK THE CHARTER
Claim That They Are Entitled to
Hold Their Positions for a
Term of Four Years.
Arrangements Are Now Being Made to Take the
Matter Before the Supreme Court of the
State for Settlement
PLANS are now being made by a |
number of county office-holders to (
renew the fight against the char
ter, notwithstanding the fact that
that Instrument has been approved j
by the people at the polls, has \
passed the keen scrutiny of the legisla- â¢
tors and been made the basic law for this |
city and county by the signature of the !
Governor, himself a lawyer of long train- j
ing.
The movement afoot is to annul one i
of the most important provisions of the
new charter, which is to go into effect j
en the first of January. 1900. The matter j
in issue will be the terms of those offi- |
cials who, by a recent decision of the Su- |
preme Court of California, were' held to â 
be county officers, as distinguished from j
municipal, under the consolidated form j
of government of the city and county of
San Frai Cisco. No attempt will be made,
It is sserted, to attack the charter ex
cept as to this particular matter.
The offices affected are those of Re
corder, District Attorney. Public Admin
istrator, County Clerk, Sheriff, Coroner,
Justices of the Peace and Police Judges.
It is claimed the new charter, in cur
tailing the terms of office from four years !
to one, is in conflict with the county gov
ernment act, and that a municipal char
ter cannot legally interfere or legislate in
county affairs. This will be â¢ the ground
of contention except in the cases of the
Justices of the Peace and Police Judges. |
In regard to the latter it will be held
that these courts are part of the judicial
system of the State and are not, there
fore, affected by the charter.
Section 5S of the county government act
provides:
All elective unty and township officers
and city Justices of the Peace, except
otherwise provided for In this act, shall
he elected ,it the general election at which
the Governor is elected, and shall take
office at 12 o'clock meridian on the first

A SENSATIONAL STORY
WM. BUDDE NOT RAILROADED
TO THE ASYLUM.
He Was Legally Declared Insane.
The Knowledge Kept From His
Wife for Sufficient
Reasons.
The sensational Story published In an
evptilnp paper that WMliam Rudde, who
died last Friday at the Stockton Insane
Asylum, had been railroaded to that in
stitution is emphatically denied by Dr. D.
M. Coney, a brother-in-law of the de
ceased, and a reputable citizen of this
city.
"That Rudde was insane," said Coney,
"was proven to the satisfaction of two
Insanity Commissioners. Prs. Pwindell
and Wadsworth. The reason why Rudde
was not brought into court was on ac
count nf his weak physical condition, and
a special order was issued to have him
examined at St. Mark's Hospital, where
he was confined. The reason for his wife
being kept in ignorance of his insanity
was her delicate condition and the hope
that her husband might be restored to
health and the full use of his senses."
"Lust December Rudde was taken with
hallucinations and imagined that he was
going Insane. On account of his extreme
nervous condition the 'rest cure' was pre
scribed for him and he was taken to a

his hold and fell back twenty feet
through a skylight, and fractured his
knee cap Notwithstanding his injury he

at the last election that as an election
for Governor takes place only every four
years, the terms of all officers included in
the foregoing prevision of the county gov
ernment act must be co-extensive with
the terms of office of the Governor, or i
four years.
In order to further substantiate this
contention a bill has been introduced In i
the Legislature amending the county gov

known a.< 58%, which provides that the
terms of the officers named In section 58
shall be for a period of four years.

This last provision curtails the terms of
all the Incumbents, with the two excep
tions specified in the charter, to one year.
It is proposed to take the matter to the
Supreme Court, as soon as the proper
time arrives. The matter has been the
subject of frequent discussions among the
officials at the City Hall, and legal advice
has been sought. According to the opin
ion of one of the attorneys consulted, the ,
incumbents have a good case on which to.
base proceedings for the retention of their:
offices for four years.
When Recorder Berthier -was inter
viewed in retard t<. the matter he de
clared that there was no intention to at
tack the charter as a whole, but only so
far as it affected the terms of offli
the county officials. He added that it had
not yet been decided in whose name the
proceedings would be brought, nor at
what time. He said that it was simply "a
move intended to protect the rights of
these who believed they were entitled to
hold for four years," despite the provi
sions of the charter.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, StTINPAY. MARCH 5, 1899,
ALL HONOR TO EMMET,
PATRIOT AND MARTYR
IN song and oratory the name and
fame of the Irish patriot Robert
Emmet was extolled in Metropoli
tan Temple last evening before a
tremendous gathering of his fellow
countrymen, who cheered the mention
of his name and grew enthusiastic over
the recital of his great undertaking to
secure liberty for their native country.
The occasion was the celebration of
the anniversary of the birthday of
the martyred patriot, given under the
auspices of the Knights of the Red
Branch. Hardly a seat remained va
cant in the handsomely decorated hall
when Dr. A. P. O'Brien, chief surgeon
of the now famous First California
Regiment, opened the entertainment
with a short address. Like those who
followed him. he was warmly greeted.
He told his listeners that they had all
gathered to do honor to the great Em
met, whose name was revered by every
lover of liberty.
Dr. O'Brien stated that owing to a
press of business brought on by the
closing days- of the Legislature, His
Excellency Governor Gage could not
be present to act as chairman. He
read a letter of regret from the chief
executive, and also from Archbishop
Riordan and General Shafter. When
the hero of Santiago's name was men
tioned it was received with tremendous
applause.
The committee of arrangements
spared no expense nor labor in their
efforts to beautify the temple. The
stage was a mass of color tastefully
displayed, and was favorably com
! on by every one present.
Across the platform a huge Ameri
can fine was suspended, and beneath
its folds a picture of the patriot in
whose honor the celebration was given
was entwined with evergreens, a fit
ting token that his memory will evÂ«r
remain bright in the hearts of his
countrymen. "His epitaph shall he
written," was displayed immediately
beneath his picture in bright letter-
Ing.
his picture in bright lettering.
Between the two gas jets used in il
luminating the back part of the plat
form a harp composed of myriad jets
of flame shone in splendor. Festoons
of green, white and yellow bunting
heightened the effect. Potted plants
and ferns completed the pretty decora
tions.
Mayor James D. Phelan delivered an
eloquent oration and was repeatedly
cheered by the big audience. He dwelt
on the Irish struggle for liberty, the.
noble resolve of Emmet, and told of
his sad end. The speaker save a his

Z. Zelinsky Brands Attorney Petty a
Liar and Precipitates a Fight
Which Is Quelled With
Difficulty.
A defendant untutored in the ways of
the law and the etiquette of its courts
created a sensation yesterday in the
courtroom of Justice of the Peace Cook.
It was the ease, of John Quadt against
Z. Zelinsky for material furnished.
Attorney Perry represented Qtfadt and
was pressing his claim vigorously. Dur
ing his argument in comhating the claims
of Zelinsky, he said: "I'll show that
statement to he false!"
"You lie!" shouted ZelinPky, forgetting
his surroundings. He rose to his feet and
was gesticulating wildly the while his at
torney was pulling Zellnsky's coattails
and trying to calm his ruffled feelings.
The irate litigant shook his clinched fist
Â»t Attorney Perry and was ready for any
kind of an encounter.
Justice Cook took a hand in the proceed
ings at once. He told Zelinsky he would
not tolerate such language and such ac
tion in his presence and would commit
him for contempt. That that was no
place for barroom brawling.
As he has no bailiff to maintain order,
his Honor dispatched a messenger to the
Sheriff's office. Under Sheriff David Mar
tin and a deputy responded at once and
restored the peace. After the parties at
I interest left the courtroom they renewed
hostilities. Tne corridors rang with their
verbal battle, attracting a large crowd.
Sheriff Martin was again forced to assert
his authority and the combatants finally
left the building by separate entrances.
The case was for the collection of a bill
I against Zelinsky for material used on the
Affiliated Colleges building. He claimed
it was not delivered in due season and in
conseuence he was damaged to a degree
sufficient to offset the first claim. After
judgment was rendered against defend
ant he boasted that it would never be col
lected, as he was execution proof, and the
trouble is still brewing.

WORDS OF PRAISE FOR
THE ALMSHOUSE
GRAND JURY COMMITTEE'S
FLATTERING REPORT.
Existing Excellent Conditions Do
Not Agree With the Common
Idea of the "Poorhouse."
The report of the committee appointed
by the Grand Jury to examine into the
condition cf affairs at the City and County
Almshouse ha? been received by that body
and reflects much credit on the managers
of the institution. It shows a wonderful
increase in improvement and a decrease
in general expenses.
The report commends Ihe condition of
the grounds, and states that economy is
practiced to good advantage by the sys
tem of imposing manual labor upon the
inmates. The men cultivate fifty-two
acres of land planted in different vege
tables and hay. and the women do house
work and' mending.
The product of vegetables entirely sup
plies the inmates for the year, mid the
potatoes for seven or eight months. ThÂ«
aggregate production of this farming,
which is all done by inmates, affords an
important reduction of expenses. Out of
the appropriation for maintenance of last
and the previous fiscal year, a new and
very commodious laundry was construct
ed, with foundations, walls and flooring
of cement, tin roof and modern ma
chinery, including a new 2,">-horsepower
engine and boiler. A new concrete
morgue was also constructed. The cost
of both was $6024 77. These new buildinga
were built by the inmates, with the ex
ception of foreman and finishers.
During the last fiscal year the Board
of Fire Commissioners presented the in
stitution with a new fire engine and a
concrete building in which to shelter it.
costing $UÂ»24 86. This Includes 1800 feet of
pipe connections, and catastrophe by fire
may now be averted. A tire brigade has
been organized and they drill frequently.
Complimentary mention is made of th'i
library now being erected at a cost of
several thousand dollars by Mayor Phe
lan and of a handsome piano donated by
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst. The hospital and
accommodations for religious servic.
are highly commended. Recommendation
is made for a new building for the accom
modation of married couples, a new stable
and minor improvements, aggregating
about $25,000. Â«.,*..Â«
The report closes by giving a tabulated
statement of the decrease in expenses for
the past fiscal year, as compared with
previous year, as follows:
In the fiscal year 1596-96 the daily aver
age of officers, employes and inmates was
875; the daily cost of maintenance to the
institution was $21S 15, or 2'^ cents per
inmate. In 1897, T<4t persons cost $207 39
daily, or 22 a i cents per capita, and in 189S
the 092 inmates cost J2OS 42 per day, or 21.9
cents per capita.

WONDERS OF
NIAGARA FALLS WINTER
If I MS the slg-ht of a lifetim* to see
I Niagara Falls In winter.
â  During January or February
;JL of any year It is well worth a
trip across the continent, but :
this year it has been grander than ever.
Indeed it is said to rival the display it
made in ISS3, which surpassed in gran
deur that of any previous winter on
record.
Of course when Niagara is in its
â¢winter glory the weather is intensely '
cold. So cold that, the flngers^and toes
of visitors sometimes get frozen and
only the heaviest wraps can keep out
the Arctic atmosphere. But the colder
the weather the more beautiful the dis
play of Jack Frost.
This year the intense cold weather
. began early in January and kept up
steadily for weeks. The result is that
the spray from ; the immense body of
falling water. has been frozen to every
. thing with which it came in contact.
The trees on Goat Isjand are like a
dream in fairy land. Every branch,
twig and dead leaf Is covered with a
thin coating of glistening ice. There
are myriads of branches bo fine as to
be scarcely visible, but all are coated
bo clenrly and distinctly that they look
lik*> the finest of filmy lace.
It does not look likÂ« cotton lace, but
lace of diamonds, rubies, emeralds and
pearls. Countless branches gently
move and sparkle with dazzling bright
ness. When the sun comes out with its
pale, weak rays scarcely able to cast a
shadow and passes through the Ice
covered branches a prismatic effect of
color is produced that it is impossible
to Imagine. It is the rainbow frozen
solid and then broken up into millions
of pieces, each a glistening bit of float-
Ing, living light.
No greater illustration of what can
be done by the accumulation of small
particles can be found. In all the world
than thÂ«Â» great ice mountain that
formed this year at the foot of Ameri- 1
can Falls. Molecules of water almost
as fine as those in steam have been
frozen one by nnc until they have piled
up nearly 100 feet Into a solid hill that
weighs millions of tons. This hill, or
mountain, as the visitors call it, is as
round and smooth as a hailstone. It is
great sport to climb this hiil and then
Bit down. Instantly you are at the bot
tom, having slipped over the smooth ice
as easily as though you were dropping
through space.
fr This little feat that Bends a thrill
through you more "breath-taking" than
any toboggan slide is not without its
dangers. Foolhardiness generally meets

with disaster. Early In the season a
boy, not content with the speed he could
obtain by sitting down on the ice and
letting himself go, concluded to Improve
things with the aid of a large tin pie
plate. He put this under him for a
seat and gave himself a shove. But po
little resistance did the tin pan offer to
the ice that he shot forward with the
speed of a cannon ball, and when he
reached the bottom, instead of stopping
comfortably In a snowdrift, kept on go
ing- and flew through the air for a dis
tance of fifty feet, finally bumping
against a block of ice and being
knocked senseless. He sustained a
slight fracture of the skull, and was
laid up for several weeks.
Naturally, during the long spell of
cold weather, the supply of water for
the falls Is considerably diminished. In
certain spots It only fell down In trick
ling streams that quickly froze and
formed enormous icicles. One "formed
near the stairway this year that was
over ten feet thick and seventy feet
long. Old visitors to the falls say that
It Is the largest icicle they ever saw.
For. a short distance below the falls
on both sides of the river the icy mantle
has covered every standing: object. Tel
egTaph poles, bridge's, wires, trees and
fences all are given a coating <<f icy
varnish. The bluffs on both sides of
the river are simply walls of Ice with
Etalartites hanging here and there in
the most fantastic manner.
Snow has fallen once or twice since
the cold weather set in and in many
places has filled up the crevices In the
ley walls and softened the face of na
ture.
While Niagara has been In its most
beautiful winter garb the crowds of
visitors have been fnr greater than on
the average day (luring the summer.
Regular excursions have boon run from
Buffalo and other near-by towns. It
Is Â«lso customary for parties to charter
a private car and make a gala winter
day picnic of the trip to the frozen
â waterfall. Parties have even come from
as far away as New York.
It is a ptrange sight to see the river,
that in the summer is a whirling eddy
ofturbulent waters, as solid as a road
way, with thousands of people walking
about on the surface. At night the
boys build fires on tho ice and light up
the whiteness of the surroundings, giv
ing an entirely new aspect to thne beau
ties of the scene.
Not content with what nature haÂ«
done with ice the people of Niagara
Falls have built an enormous ice palace
that from a distance looks like a
structure of the whitest marble. In
side is a skating rink, where visitors
have the joiliest kind of times.
Part of the skating rink programme
consists of masquerade balls. Of course
skates take the place of dancing slip
pers, but the general effect of the merry
makers as they appear on the "floor"
is not particularly different from any
mardi gras ball. There are all kinds of
costumes, and of all the colors of the
rainbow, and over all is shed the bril
liancy of electric lights reflected from
walls of ice.
But it will all be over soon. A couple
of days of spring sunshine and the iri
descent beauty will vanish into water

Do Charitable Organizations Encourage Pauperism?
DISCUSSED BY i David Starr Jordan, Dr. Joseph Le Conte, N. P. Cole, Mrs. A. F- Morrison, C. V. S. Glbbs, Mrs. Lovefl White, William Doxey.
Mrs. Judge Currey, William Sproule, Mrs, P. N. Lllienthal, Captain Oliver Eldrldge.
DO charitable organizations lessen poverty and raise the in
digent? Do they encourage pauperism? Do they create the
evil they are designed to relieve? Are they breeders of idle
ness among the weak-spirited? What are they accomplishing
with that great social problemâ the poor? Some of those best
qualified to discuss these questions have briefly answered them below:
* â¢ â¢
The question Is a very complex one and I fear that these charitable
Institutions are regarded by many as a sort of bonus to idleness.
f â  S> The main thing is the next generation,
DR JOSFPH I F rnNTP and when we strive to strengthen the
UK. JUbtPH LE CONTE, gre&tetit prO pagators of the world (the
Univemity of California, we ak and impoverished) we are poisoning
* â -^ the blood of the next generation by the
preservation of their species.
Some years ago I had thoughts upon this subject, but it was too
wide a field to follow up; however, I reasoned upon the following
hypothesis: In organic evolution "the fittest" are those most in har
mony with the physical environment, and therefore they survive. In
human evolution the fittest are those most in harmony with the ideal,
and often, especially in the earlier stages, when the race is still
largely under the dominion of organic factors, they do not survive,
because not in harmony with the social environment. But, although
the fittest individuals may indeed perish, the ideal survives in the
race and will eventually triumph.
In organic evolution the weak, the sick, the helpless, the unfit
in any way perish and ought to perish, because this is the most
efficient way of strengthening the blood or physical nature of the
species, and thus carrying forward evolution.
In human evolution the weak, the helpless, the sick, the old, the
unfit In any way are sustained because sympathy, love and pity
strengthen the spirit or moral nature of the race. But let us remem
ber that in this material world of ours and during this earthly life
the spirit or moral nature is conditioned on the physical nature, and,
therefore, in all our attempts to help the weak we must be careful to
avoid poisoning the blood and weakening the physical vigor of the
race by inheritance.
This gravest of social problems, namely: How shall we obey the
higher law of love and mutual help without weakening the blood of
the race by inheritance and the spirit of the race by removing the
question of self-help? This problem, I believe, will be 6olved by a
rational education, physical, mental and moral.
I am unable to give any decided opinion In regard to the matter,
but I think all who are Interested in Buch Institutions feel at times
<&, â â¦ that their alms are misdirected. I should

tude. On the whole I think that those who are helping others would
rather be fooled once In a while than to allow a worthy applicant of
charity to gro unheeded.
So there remains bat one solution to the vexing problemâ we must
sustain charitable institutions which are united in their efforts to
seek and succor the feeble.

This subject admits of no Inconsiderable diversity of opinion, and
one cannot hope to reach any definite conclusions in the matter.

provide his own sustenance or he would perforce perish, but such a
condition is manifestly incompatible with the present order of things.
There are many among us who are absolutely dependent on the
charity of their fellow-beings. Their survival Is due to the tenderness
which is lodged in almost every human breast. It Is right that it
should be so, and it is the only -thing possible. But unfortunately
charity does not confine her favors to those who are deserving of
them, but bestows assistance where evil sometimes results from her
generosity. For in every community' there are those who prefer to
depend upon the milk of human kindness rather than to earn their
own living. Now if these men who beg their way through life were
confronted with the proposition that unless they toiled for their daily
HAND TO HAND FIGHT WITH A GRIZZLY
Thrilling Experience of a Fresno County Hunter While Out Camping in the Sierras.
TO roll down a snow-covered moun
tain side tightly clasped in the em
brace of a grizzly bear is an ex
perience few men pass through and
live to tell: but that 1b what hap
pened to Frank Lecky of Fresno
about two weeks ago, and he has only a
few scratches and bruises and a big bear
skin to show as signs of his terrible en
counter.
"It was the wickedest fight I over got
Into," said Frank when telling of his ex
periences, "and I have been In a good
many, going out hunting In the Sierras
every winter, as I do.
"This big fight happened up In the Whit
ney country. It was juat a few miles east
of the Minarets, and in a spot where
a fellow is always pretty sure to find big
game.
"It was pretty late In the afternoon,
and I was all alone In camp, as the other
boys had not returned from a deer hunt
they started on in the morning.
"I had been dozing In the tent all day,
but came out to have a look at the sky.
As I glanced along the top of a bluff a
few hundred feet from camp I saw some
thing dark moving about.
"That was enough for me. I got my
rifle and Btarted right after it. The kind
of game I was going after didn't con
cern me at all, but I really didn't expect
bear, at least such big cantankerous bear.
'Taking a roundabout way through the
Bnnw, I Boon reached the top of the bluff,
and began to crawl along carefully in
orrlor to get a good resting shot and not
come upon my game too suddenly.
"Finally I caught a close view of a big
dark body movfng behind a clump of
bu^hos. It was so large that for a mo
ment I thougnt I had been stalking a
cow. and was ready to kick myself. Then
a long-drawn sniff and a deep growl told
me it was bear I was sighting. Instantly
I was all excited with interest, and
strained every nerve to get the beast in
line and so plant a bullet into the right
epot. The bear, however, had a mind to
keep his eyes on me, and kept moving
"I Kept Strikiog at the Bear Witt) My KDife as We Rolled aod Bounded Dowq the Hillside Till Suddeoly There Came a Terrific Burop and the Bear Let Go
about as he peered between the branches
of^ the brush.
"Suddenly one of the horses down in
camp neighed loudly and attracted the
bear's attention. As the bear turned and
exposed his Bide I fired. Down went the I
bear like a bag of wheat, and I thought
my rifle ball must have gone clean
through its brain. Without stopping to
consider whether my shot had really been
fatal, I rushed forward. As I stooped
down to see where theball struck the bear
Jumped up, and then I knew I had only
'creased' itâ that is. Just grazed its head
or spiral cord and knocked it senseless
for a moment.
"Before I could swing my rifle forward
to get in a shot the bear had knocked It
out of my hands, and was right on top
of me. Somehow I managed to draw my
knife and get in a few jabs that did no
damage. The bear hugged me tighter and
tighter, and I kicked harder and harder
and jabbed wildly with my knife. Then
we both rolled on the ground, and the
bear tried to bite my face, but I kept
off his fast clawing blows by hugging
tightly against him. I jabbed and jabbed
as we - rolled over and over, and the bear's
face and jaws were pretty badly cut and
one of his eyes put out of service. The
snow all around was torn up and spat
tered with blood.
"Before I knew It we were Just on thÂ«
edge of the bluff, and an almost vertical
wall of snow lay just beiow us for over a
hundred feet to the bottom.
"This frightened me more than tho bear,
for I knew what it meant, but before I
could think of doing anything we were
over the edge and rolling down at light
ning speed.
"It could not have taken more than a
few seconds, but It seemed to me like
years. Now I waa on top of the bear,
and now underneath. Snow filled my
eyes and" ears, and I was scratched and
wounded and bumped until I thought my
end had come.
"It seems to mo that I kept striking at
the bear as we rolled, or rather shot,
downward, for we were going at the speed
of a cannon ball. Then there was a sud
den bump, while I was on top. and the
bear gave a moan of pain and let go of
me.

bread they would surely go to the wall It Is more than probable that
every one of them would find means for his maintenance.
But unfortunately our civilization Is such that there can be no
classification of those who are deserving of charity and those who are
not, and were the attempt made there would doubtless be much in
justice done on both sides. And so each of us must make his own
choice, using his best judgment and being neither too liberal nor too
stinted, for there are those who really deserve our help. And we
should be thankful, moreover, that we are not afflicted with the
hordes of paupers that inrest the cities of Southern Europe and prove
such a pest to those who are compelled to abide with them. Our
freedom from this evil is probably due partly to our beggary laws
and partly to the energry and enterprise of the American character

Pieii^nt Sin Francisco Benevolent think them a public necessity. The San
Association. Francisco Benevolent Society used to re
â<S> ceive $5000 per year from the Police Court
fines, which was distributed without expense to the city to the ab
ject poor. This fund ceased a year or so ago, and now were it not
for the bequests made by philanthropic individuals we would have
been obliged to close our doors long &go. I think that the city should
tax us and the fund be applied to the lowest rate of wages for public
improvement which can be obtained, and then when the unemployed
desire aid let them be set to work. This method would relieve cases
of poverty that cannot be remedied otherwise.
To a certain extent these charitable institutions do foster pau
perism, but at the same time they do more good than harm, infinitely
<$> â $> more so. If It were not for the charitable
WILLIAM DOXEY, societies a great many worthy people
Pretldent British Benevolent Se- would be in dire distress. There are two
ciety. classes of worthy people â one is the man
<$> â  $ who Is willing to work but Is not able to
obtain employment. If he Is a single man he is deserving of pity, but
if he has a family depending upon him It Is not enough to help him
up; we must find him permanent means of support for that family.
The British Benevolent Society gives only temporary relief to
enable them to tide over a little time and will not accept chronlo
cases of destitution. It is particularly necessary for us to have an
Institution, because Britishers come from all over the world to this
pivotal point. We seem to be the center of the world for the British
wanderer, and have calls from Japan, Canada, British Columbia, New
Zealand and India. In a great many instances the money which we
have expended has been returned to us, thus enabling us to help others
with the same fund. The other class of worthy poor is the sickly
and unable to work kind. The great trouble that we have with this
class is that they are apt to think that they are pensioners. The
indiscriminate giving of meal tickets to great strapping fellows who
won't work makes the work of the society still more difficult. The
general public usually support this class. I believe that the societies
are doing a vast amount of good by their careful system of investiga
tion and assistance to the worthy poor.

case must be treated on its merits. To do this requires brains. The
value of associated charities and charity commissions is in the fact
that they are able to call brains into service.
Poverty is not pauperism. The person now subject to poverty
may have within himself the cure for it. The pauper cannot cure
himself, and all help given him but intensifies his pauperism. There
are various conditions â sickness, dissipation, the weakness of age, evil
associations â that may plunge the average man from poverty' into
pauperism. We are none too well equipped for the struggle for life
at the best, and the loss of weapons may make any man helpless for
the time being, but some are helpless from the time of birth.

fitness Is impossible. They are simply incapable, and they are the
descendants of others who in similar conditions have been likewise
incapable. They are born to misery, and the aggregate of mtsery
would be sensibly lessened had they never been born. Hereditary
Incapacity of the few has been in all ages a burden on the many
who could take care of themselves. The descendants of these increase
in number with the others. Thus the future of hereditary weakness
is a growing problem in our social organization. The destruction of
the unfit has not kept pace with their power of reproduction. We
may blame the kind influence of charity for lack of discrimination in
its efforts for the help of our neighbors.
The indiscriminate charity of the Middle Ages is responsible for
much of the misery of ours. It is only lately that science has shown
that charity is to be Judged not by its motives, but by its results.
"Charity, falsely bo called," says McCulloch, "covers a multitude
of Bins, and sends the paupers out with the benediction 'Be fruitful
and multiply ! >J -'
Such charity has made this element, has brought children to
birth and insured them a life of misery, cold, hunger, sickness. From
all institutions a certain form of degeneration must arise, because all
institutions tend in some degree to do away with individual effort.
All forms of tyranny have their beginning in kindness. Paternalism
in time hardens into oppression and checks the growth of the in
dividual man, who should become responsible to himself and for ,
himself.
Of course the conditions of life have never yet made the survival
of the fittest" the real survival of the best. The growth of civilization
approaches this end, but has never reached it. In knowledge lies the
surest remedy for most social and political evils. "What more can
be done is the work of students of social science to determine.
Dr. Amos \G. Warner has well said that the "true function of
charity is to restore to usefulness those who are temporarily unfit,
and to allow those unfit from heredity to become extinct with as little
pain as possible." Sooner or later the last duty will not be lesÃ im
portant and pressing 'than the first. Good blood as well as free
schools and free environment is essential to the making of a nation.

to close our doors to all applicants save those who askPd for work.
These we are still helping and on the whole it is the most satisfactory
method that we have yet pursued. Education and employment are
the most potent agents yet found to eradicate the evil of pauperism.

The fireman in a blue sweater,
pering out of a second story win

did not seem to relish the idea. He shoot

"They're all a bit nervous about it at

in charge of the proceedings, "He's a Hew

The engineer knew what he wm talking
about. He had not been drilling firemen
for years without gauging the stuff out of
which his heroic fire-fighters were made,
Sure enough, as we watched, the man at
the window gathered up his courage and
plunged boldly downward, flashing
through the air like a meteor.
There was really no danger about the
feat, it only looked a bit awkward. Be

men spread themselves round the circum

feet in diameter, xney grMpod the thlek

against the shock, pulling backward with
all their might, and at thÂ© same ttmÂ§
keeping a wary eye on the Jumper abeve,
It was all over in a second. The body
plunged Into the center of the net, forcing
It inward and downward until In the midÂ»
die it nearly touched the ground, But tha
power of the twelve strong men offered
sufficient resistance, the Jumper escaped
unhurt. He did not, an one might i.aye
expected, rebound violently like a ball
from the net; there was no tossing effect.
He simply turned a half somersault back.
ward, and the twelve mon drew the net
back to Its original position.
There is something more than mere
muscular strength needed to perform this
net-practice eafely. The holders hayÂ«
to be watchful to see that the Jump,
er does not miss the receptacle. By con
certed action a body of trained men enn
move the net several feet In either direc
tion within the very brief space of time
required to fall from a burning building,
Thus they can make sure of catching thci
escaping person, unless tho Jumper make
a very bad shot indeed.
At a real fire the greatest watchfulness
and skill would be necessary to lnsuro the
effective use of the net. Half-crazed suf
ferers, blinded by smoke and scorched by
heat, cooped up on the roof of pnme high
building, cannot Jump with the same skill
and accuracy as a fireman on drill. < -.;
"Some of them," remarked Engineer
Fernandez, "would be sure to miss, es
pecially the women, "but I think we could
manage to catch most. Even if the height
were too much for' the men to keep the
net from touching the ground, they would
at any rate be able to break the fall, and
the sufferer would get off with some
bruises or perhaps a broken bone. You
cannot expect a man or woman' impris
oned In a" burning building to behave .with,
the coolness of a trained fireman. Why,
there was that man we took off the cor
nirfÂ» of the Baldwin. We Just reached him
in time, and next day. when he had got
over his fright, he came around to the
station and told us that in a couple of
minutes more he would have cut his
throat."
It Is good to know that our firemen are
so diligently practicing the use of these
r.ew life-saving devices. Every Sunday
morning one or other company of
firemen ' gathers at the Seventeenth
street station for drill. The place
Is admirably equipped for ' the pur
pose. There is a high, four-square
wooden tower, bunt like a house, and ris
ing toa height of seventy-five feet. It has
windows on each story, and is supplied
with a regular fire-escape and hose pipe.
Every kin<l of fire drill can be carried on
with the aid of the tower, but Just -at
present we are more Interested In -the new
life-saving devices -. which have been
brought from the East, and in the use of
which our firemen are rapidly becoming
skilled. The net which we have already
seen is of local manufacture, constructed'
out of the finest tiemi . exactly on the
principle of a spider's web. Experts dif
fer as to the best kind of net to be used.
In some Eastern cities they employ can
vas, and In I>ondon rubber sheeting.
Engineer Fernandez is a firm believer. In
good, old-fashioned rope. "Nothing is so
strong," he says. "Canvas may split, or
rubber stretch, but rope will never go. See
how many meshes there are! It would be
impossible for enough: of those to get rot
ten all at once to cause danger. Why, I
have tested this net by dropping a bag of
sand lnto.lt from the top of the tower.
You can imagine the force with which a
dead weight would fall from such a
height. The net showed no signs of giv
ing, but the men who held, it felt the
shock terribly. They all had sore necks
next day." . . - '
Even more interesting as a drill, and Im
portant as a life-saving , device, Is the
hook-and-lsdder exercise. It is marvelous
what trained men can do with- these sim
ple Implements. Four of them rest on tho
ground before the tower. They are mar
vels of Ingenious construction, made by a
celebrated Kansas firm in such a manner
as to combine the maximum of strength
with the minimum of weight.
Strictly speaking It is hardly right. to
call these Instruments â¢ ladders. They do
not conform to the conventional type at
all. Instead of having two uprights with
rungs between, they consist simply of a
Btout hickory pole having short cross*
pieces at convenient Intervals.' The steps
are just wide enough to afford foothold
for a man and strong enough to bear any
weight which can be put upon them.
The pole is about fifteen feet long, and is
strengthened by a stout steel wire fast
ened along its entire length. Even if the
woOd should break or burn through, the
wire would still hold, and the ladder is
guaranteed to bear a strain of 2000 pounds,
though it weighs only twenty-five.
The hook, however. Is the most interest
ing feature of the device. The ladder ter
minates in a strong, steel arm, extending 1
at right angles for about three feet, and
slightly curved at the end. The Inner
edge Is serrated to prevent slipping, and
Is capable of taking a firm hold on wood
or store or iron.
"Take up ladders!" commands the en
gineer, and four men, girdled with 'hugÂ©
canvas belts, rush to their posts and seize
the ladders, raising them perpendicularly
â¢against the wall. The belt is an essential
â feature of the equipment, quite as much
so as the ladder, for one would be useless
without the other. It is constructed of
stoat woven material, fastened by leather
thongs. It needs to be well made, for
every time It Is used the fireman trusts
his life to It. In front. Is a large steel
hook made with a spring snap, so that it
can be readily hooked onto anything.
"Scale the tower!" Is the next order,
and the eager firemen rush at the doomed
building, which is supposed Just now to be
enveloped in flame and smoke. The fire
escape is not available, and the problem
the men have to solve is the scaling cf
this seventy-flve-foot building with no
' other aid than their hooks and ladders.
The task does not daunt them; were the
structure twice as high they would at
. tack it with equal readiness.

Knaps his hook on the top of thÂ« ladder,

der; and this in its turn is attached to the
â¢window sill- of the next story. The leader

story after Btory the process is repeated
until the top is reached. In a marvelously
Bhort time all four mon are on the roof,
line in hand, ready to haul up hose or to
rescue the imprisoned victims of the fire.
To come down Is simply a reversal of
the process, but our agile firemen know of
many a shorter cut. Each climber carries
with him, slung round his shoulder, a coil
pf stout manila rope, and with this and
his snap-hook, he has a perfect fire-escape
all ready made. At the third story of the
building, far below the rescuers on the
roof, a woman leans out of the window
Bhrieking frantically for help. The flames
have cut her off from the staircase, soon
they will burst into her room. Already
great volumes of smoke are pouring from
the window. If she ia to be saved it must
be done quickly.
The fire laddies are never at a loss. To
go down the ladders would be too slow.
Taking a couple of staples from a pouch
on his belt, the fireman quickly attaches
the rope to the cornice. In a second he
has taken a couple of turns with 'the rope
around his snap hook. With one hand he
grasps the rope underneath and boldly
throws himself over the edge.
The friction of the rope on the ring
checks his descent, he slides rapidly but
safely to the third-story window, and
dashes bravely Into the burning room.
Overcome by the smoke and heat the wo
man has fallen prostrate on the floor, but
the intrepid rescuer seizes her In his arms
and ruphes to the window.
There Is no time to hesitate, no time to
lower the victim to the ground. At any
moment the flame?, now bursting through
the upper windows, may burn the rope

woman has just strength enough to clasp

SALARIES THAT KINGS GET
HOW much 'do a k'ng get?" asked
one of Mark Twain's odd charac
ters, and the answer was not very
satisfactory. If we apply the title
"kin?" to each of the chief execu
tives of the great nations, there is
no wonder an answer was difficult, for the
pay of rulers varies greatly and is gov
erned by no Â«parent rule of proportion,
unless it is that the pay increases with
the liability to assassination. The ex
tremes of salary are illustrated by the pay
of the Czar of. Russia and the President
of Switzerland. The former gets $24,000 a
day, while the latter is happy and satis
fled -with $7 92 each twenty-four hours.
These figures are based on 365 working
day.= In the year, for monarchs are sup
posed to be always working.
Now these executivesâ of > Russia and
Switzerlandâ are at the extremes of the
rulers' payroll, the first getting $5.766.000 a
ypar. and the other $2900. Between these
extremes the other eleven nations consid
ered are scattered in a haphazard man
ner, with no uniform relation between the
amount of yearly salary and the number
of persons who must pay it. The Emperor
of Austria, with his $4,380,000 annually,
comes next under the Czar of all the Rus
slas, while President McKlnley, with his
$50,000, comes next above the President of
little Switzerland. After Austria comes

Victoria. $1,875,000; King of Belgium. $632.
--000; King of i>orway and Sweden. $560,000;
Queen of the Netherlands. $292,000; King
of Greece, $253,000, and the President of
France $239,<XH). The latter receives
but little more regular salary than Presi
dent McKinley, but he has fixed perquis
ites that bring dis income from the State
to the amount given.
An idea of the relative proportion be
tressed, shrieking female In the case, but
a young lightweight acts the part perfect
ly well. Not that it is necessary that the
person to be rescued should be light. The
heaviest man can be saved as well as the
smallest woman. By slipping a loop
around the man's legs and then taking a
half-hitch under his shoulders he can be
lowered with perfect ease to the street.
Or if the man is coo.l and strong enough
to hold on he can take a firm grip round
the fireman's waist, allowing the body to
hang down. The two. with the aid of the
hook, can slide to the street. The same
appliances can be utilized in many other
ingenious ways, but it would take too
long to detail all the devices which our
clever firemen employ for saving life. It

consider one printed line of the Herald as
representing the salary of the Czar, then
a period will represent the stipend of the

the Emperor of Austria receives, and a

Great Britain pays to Queen Victoria.
The amounts of the salaries of these
honored men and women bear very odd
relations to the number of persona for
whose benefit they are supposed to ad
minister laws of their own or the people's
making. Now, each subject of the Czar
has to annually pay 7 4-5 cents to his rul
er, and stands eighth on the list; while
the Persians, each of whom must yearly
pay to the Shah 30Â«- 4 cents, head it. Switz
erland, with the smallest population and
salary, does not pay the least per capita,
for the United States, with .07 of a cent
for each Inhabitant, Is at the bottom of
the list, Switzerland being next above,
with .08 of a cent. Turkey, with 20 cents
for each subject, naturally comes next
below Persia, and Greece, with 11 2-5
cents, comes next. Then. In the descend
ing scale, come Austria, with 10 2-5 cents
for each subject to pay to the ruler; Bel

and Sweden, 8 cents: then Russia, then
Germany. 6 3-5 cents; Holland, 6 1-5;
France, 6: Great Britain, 4 3-5, and then
Switzerland and the T'nlted States.
Figures alone hardly convey to ordinary
mortals an idea of the amounts of some
of these salaries. Take, for instance, the
$5 .766.000 received annually by the Czar.
Put that amount in silver dollars, and
perhaps it will carry more of a meaning.
It would mean 274 tons of silver, and if

TARKIO, Mo., Feb. 2S.â A millionaire
farmer is clearly to be reckoned a sort
of latter day miracle; all the more if he
lives in Missouri, and farms all-round,
and all the year round.
Tarkio, Atchison County, Is his local
habitation, David Rankin his name. To
be strictly accurate, the Hon. David Ran
kin; he has served more than one term
In a State Legislature. He owns and
manages 23,000 acres of land in Atchi
son County worth from $50 to $100 the
. acre, and not in the market even at those
figures. He has bought every acre of it
since 1876, mostly from speculative East
ern holders, who were gleeful at getting
J6 to $10 an acre for their holdlnj be
cause the railway, you see, had passed
them by.
It gives a new idea of magnificent \\ est
crn distances to know that the Rankin
lands are scattered over an area of forty
odd miles. Yet their owner visits them
all every little while. He lives in a hand
some house lust outside the town of Tar
kio Five o'clock every flne morning finds
him in his buggy, whirling to his main
office as fast as a spanking span can car

awaiting him. A brief Interval of talk,
clear and pointed Instructions, a low
notes, mental and written: then he whips
away for a round of maybo half a dozen
of his fourteen farms before he thinks
of turning his horses' heads home.
The farms run from 600 to acres. To
work them requires between 130 and 150
hands 700 horses, more than 100 wagons,
plows! harrows, planters, cultivators
and feeders innumerable. Each ranch is
in charge of a competent foreman, who i
gets $50 a month and board. Farm hands ;
are paid $20 a month and board. Usually |
the foreman's family runs the farm
boarding house. Besides tho various fore
men there Is a farm superintendent, at a
salary many a bank official might envy.
It is questionable, however, if his best' I
endeavors are worth as much as the eye \
of the masti r.
Never Sells His Corn.
*All the land ie arable, yet but little more
than half goes yearly under plow. Per- |
haps 2000 acres are sown to wheat. The ;
remainder is planted in corn, and yields,
in average years. 800.000 bushels. Not a
grain of it is sold until it has been trans
formed Into fat stock. In addition to his
own crop Mr. Rankin buys whatever corn
his neighbors have to sell. Ha buys also
their stall: fields, after the corn is gath
ered, and turns Into them herds of cat- j
tie. to gather up their rich gleanings. Be
sides all that, he buys ton upon ton of j
cotton seed meal, for feeding. Small won

fertility under continuous cropping.
All land not under plow is laid down
in clover, timothy and blue grass pas
tures. After standing four years they are I
fallowed, and put in grain, the grain fields
meantime going back into grass. Thus
part of the soil, originally as rich as any

a raan who owns so many teams and hires
fo many drivers to kepp all of them ac
curately in mind. But there is an infal
l!Hr> Rankln ear-markâ at Least Mr. Ran
kln himself thought so for a good while.
It Is the wagon harness. He u.=es the
old fashioned trace chains, as being both
cheaper, handler aid more lasting than
the new-fangled outfits of straps and
leather. So whenever he meets a team so
acroutered, he naturally sets it down as
part of his property. Some little time
back he met a four-horse team, brave in
chain harness, drawing a b)'p load of corn
through Tarkio streets. The sight of it
6et him wild. "Thou shalt not sell corn:"
was a sort of eleventh commandment
with him.
A favorite expression with him. and one
that he uses to give vent to his feelings.
Is "Set fire," repeated two or three times
quite- rapidly. On this occasion he com
menced with "Set fire! Bet fire!: What
are you doing here with that corn?" The
driver calmly replied that he had brought
it (o town to sell. This gave rise to a re
newed storm of "Set fires," but fortunate
ly some one who knew the man came
forward and explained matters. He was
a farmer who had adopted Mr. Rankln's
Ptyle of harness, and it was his own corn
that he had brought to town to sell.
Fattens Thousands of Cattle.
Mr. Rankin fattens more cattle than j
any other man in the world. Every year j
he buys and fattens eight to ten thousand
head. The bulk of them come from Tex
as, though Kansas, Nebraska, lowa and
Missouri are fair sources of supply. He j

HOW JHE GROWN OF INDIA ISGAfZD FROJVI TJ4E QREAT JVI/\IJL/\ND SJORM.
ONE of the victims of "the great Maitland storm"-the most disastrous hurricane that ever visited the coast of Australia-reached port last Saturday. She is the British rour-maated barJj
Crown of India, but from her trim appearance, alow and alofr, as she sailed in through the Golden Gate, no one would ever think that less than nine months ago thÂ» captain and
crew had been huddled together in her after cabin for fourteen days, hourly expecting the stout ship to go d>wn i fhÂ» Â«* rt â¢ ââ.
On the morning of May 5. 1898, the Crown of India was towed out of Newcastle, N. S. W., on her way to San Francisco. At 1:30 p. m. the tug cast her off At midnight the storm came
up and caught the ship on a lee shore. It was then a question of carrying on sail or going on the rocks. Up to 1:30 p. m. of the 6th the sticks stood the strain, then the foremast carried
away twenty feet above the deck, the main topmast eight feet below the lower cap, while the mizzen topgallant mast went by the board.
For fourteen days the dismasted vessel lay like a log within five miles of the Seal Rocks. How she escaped going on that dangerous reef is a miracle Captain Corkhill cannot explain
Vessels came and went, in the distance, but no one offered To go to the Crown of India's assistance. The Japanese steamer Tokio Maru and one of the A U. S. N. fleet passed her by. but
were in too much fear for their own safety to go near the disabled ship. Just when Captain Corkhill and his men had given up all hope the American four-masted schooner. Golden Shore,
lumber laden from Puget Sound for Adelaide, came along and immediately bore down on the derelict. "I never saw a man handle a vessel better said Captam Corkhill. Captain Rasmus
sen brought his schooner around under our Ftern, and in spite of the waves, which were rolling mountains high, he rounded too under our lee. He could do nothing for us as I would not
abandon the ship, but he steered away out of his course and beat up toward Newcastle to send us assistance. Captain Rasmussen was 'the man that did stand by. Later we were picked
up and towed into Sydney, N. S. W., where it. took six months to repair our damages." Â»,Â«â¦â r^r,* i~ â Â«-
During "the great Maitland storm" fourteen vessels went down with all hands. At the time the Crown of India towed out of Newcastle the barks Pndo and Hunter went in company
with her. Neither of them was ever heard of again. One of the apprentice boys on the Crown deserted in Newcastle and shipped on a coaster. The vessel he shipped on went down In the
hurricane and he lost his life. Â«_Â«Â«.Â«.
The passenger steamer Maitland, with over a hundred souls aboard, went down in sight of land. The beach was thronged with people eager to lend assistance but out of all aboard only
five were saved. It was from the loss of this steamer the hurricane got its name. It is no wonder therefore that Captain Corkhill when speaking of his own and his crew s rescue says that
they "came out of the jaws of death."

of a nomad. He moved many times be
tween the Indiana home and the final set
tling Jn what is now Henderson County,
Illinois. David quit the schools at the
age of 11, and set to work for his living.
Began Business With One Colt.
Doubtless he earned something more,
but it all went in the family fund. When
he was free, his father gave him a colt,
the first thing he ever owned. Most smart
youngsters would have Been in it a pros
pective saddle horse. David was another
sort. He sold the colt for $52, and put
the money in calves, to grow while he
woTked for more. Pretty soon he had
the chance to buy an eighty-acre farm.
It took grit to go in debt for it. with
wheat at 25 cents a bushel and firewood
$1 the cord. Those were the prices Da
vid's father had got for what he had to
cell. Still David bought the farm.
j Inside of four years he had paid for
it, with money earned mostly by break
ing prairie. The virgin sod Is too tough
for horses or mules. It must be turned
with the slow, steady draught of oxen.
David Rankln managed to buy a pair.
His breaking plow, a special lmple
-1 ment, he made himself by help of a local
j blacksmith. He had no money to buy
i the necessary iron, but a friend stood se
i curity, so he got it, and thus was enabled
literally to set his hand to the plow.
It is no wonder he loves land, and pre
fers it to all other investments. From the
first it has prospered him amazingly,
though from the first he haa seldom sold
i crude products. That first eighty-acre
i farm had a herd of cattle on It even be
' fore it was paid for. So driving and thriv
ing, the master of it came to own 3000
acres by the time the Civil War began.
That era of inflation sent prices too high
for his judgment. He kept on buying un
til he had 8000 acres, then went West.
Atchison County has much more than
Justified his choice of a new residence.
It is no longer a region of one railway.
A new one, the Tarkio Valley, runs right
through the middle of it. and Tarkio
town, a beautiful and thriving village, has
grown up magically in its eighteen years
of life. Naturally Rankin interests pre
dominate. David Rankin Is president
and principal shareholder Jn the town s
First National Bank, as well as president
of the Electric Light and Power Com
pany, the Water Company, the Rankin
Auditorium Company and the- Tarkio
Brick and Tile Company. These various
! enterprises represent the investments of
! over $100,000 of Rankin money. In ad
! dition to them Mr. Rankin has trade rela
tions with most of the trade centers and
is in close touch with moneyed men all
over the country.
Founds a College.
Surpassingly rich, he has forgotten
what it means to be poor. As becomes his
blood, he is a Presbyterian, and strives
: to live his religion as well as to believe j
It. Liberal in support of his church and !
her works, he can be depended on to be j
as liberal to any good cause, especially j
I the cause of education. Tarkio College
alone has received from him nearly $100,
--! 000. He had given to the institution above
$25,000, when flre destroyed the main build- I
ing. He at once offered $25,000 toward re- :
1 building if as much could be raised else- I
' where. Since then he has had a stand- |
ing offer to give to the college a dollar ;
for every dollar contributed outside. By
his help, the college has put up its pres- j
ent magnificent buildings, and holds its ;
place among high-class Western institu
tions of learning. Needless to add, Mr. j
Rankin's picture appears upon the college i
I button, or that his unique and original j
I objurgation "Set flre" makes an impor- |
i tant part of the college yell.
HÂ© has been liberal to other schools
1 than his home college, to other churches
ithan his own United Presbyterian.
Perhaps that Is how a certain man and
brother of African, descent came to rely i
'so confidently upon Mr. Rankln as the j
i lord's almoner. The brother lived in a j
! Tennessee town, and combined in his own
person the offices of pastor of a church j
and principal of a school. Church and j
school were In deÃperate need of money. !
The pastor told his brethren if only tley i
would raise money to send him to Tarkio ;
the Lord and Mr. Rankln would do the j
rest. Bo to Tarkio he came, saw and at j
first did not conquer. Mr. Rankln heard j
him with patient kindnessâ ho even sent i
courteous answers to the most barefaced :
begging lettersâ but answered with em- j
phaÃis, which no doubt seemed to the
trustful listener harsh, that help was out
Of the question; he had all he could do j
to furnish aid to his home college, his
church, and his church's school society.
The black man looked at him aghast.
Pale he could not grow, but no words
j cameâ he tried to move to go away, but j
tottered, and fell fainting, utterly strick- j
en by the shattering of his trust. In the j
end his trusting conquered. When he
went home a little later he. had in his
pocket the necessary $300. David Rankln
had given two hundred of it. The rest
came from his son and the employes of j
his office.
"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
holy" is a living law upon every foot of
Rankin land. By way of helping his men
to keep It, Mr. Rankln stipulates In the
beginning that Monday shall be pay day.
As they are paid off weekly he thinks It
wise to minimize Sunday temptations. He
does not relish the thought that a man
may waste his earnings In an hour, and
leave his family in want before next
week's money comes in.
WAX FIGURES That Gan Almost Talk
It pcqvires Qreat/Art to JVIaUe Jnem, bvjt JKis Country is Beating

Special to The Sunday Call.
Tfce creation of a perfect wax figure is
as great a triumph of art as the success
ful portrayal of life upon canvas. It takes
ac great a genius to accomplish this as to
chisel from marble a laughing naiad, or
to perpetuate mythology in statuesque
bronze.
There are good and bad creators of wax
figures, a3 there are daubers and painters,
but nowhere in the universe is so great a
variety of the sort of folk who make wax
figures found as in the United States. Nor
can any other country lay claim to such
artistic work in that line as cornea into
being here.

RUSSELL SAGE On the Extravagances of the Rick.
I HAD asked Mr. Sage for an opin
ion upon the money mistakes of
the late Calvin S. Brice.
Mr. Sage would not talk on this
subject, but he did express himself
upon the extravagances crt New
York life as above quoted.
Sage spoke earnestly. He was in
slippered ease at home after the day's
toil had been compensated for in some
measure by a before-dinner nap. The
most democratic of all millionaires had
come down to see me in his stocking
feet, carrying his shoes in his hand.

of the simple and unaffected manners
of Lincoln and Silas Wright. Russell
Sage is a gentleman of the old school
and you take him as you find him, and
you find him natural.
As usual, Mr. Sage gave voice to a
theory prolific in surprises. It is not a
growth of love of luxury which prompts
the amazing expenditure of money by
century-end New Yorkers.
"What Induces these unreasonable
outlays of money on personal ac
counts," said Mr. Sage, "is not the
gratification of luxurious tastes and
Impulses. You understand me, that it
is not, but it is an obnoxious desire to
make an appearance before the public
which will attract the attention of the
public.
"Why, my dear young man, I asÃure
you it is a fact, a surprising fact, that
men endure unwarranted expenditures
of money on their living account which
are made for no otuer purpose than
to excite the jealousies of their neigh

It is wicked. I do not say that a man
is to be so much blamed for spending
largely to gratify the hrmest tastes of
himself and his family for expensive
luxuries â horses, carriages, pictures,
music and things of such sort.
"But these are not the wrecking ex
travagances." '

far more- than we have Imported.
While there are not more than fifty per
sons in the United States who can con
struct a figure in wa* perfect, lifelike, the
work itself gives employment to a. host of
people, for in the actual work of putting
! a figure together almost every step Is a
trade by itsolf. This is where trade, and
I profession go hand in hand, for the. artist
! loses none of his art, though he calls the
tradesman to his aid.
The fact that the average Bpan of life
of a wax figure is twelve years makes
the substitution feature an important one.
It la the making of figures over and over
again which makes the profession or In

The model secured the molding of thÂ»

sculptor's early, lessons in clay modeling
are of the greatest use to him, for if he
has neglected these In any way he might
better say good-by to the wax figure and
try something else. The clay having been

right where all humanity Is born with
a soft spot. This opening Is closed and
wax and cast are allowed to stand twenty
minutes. By this time the contents of the
cast have partly cooled, part of the. top
of the head been removed and such ef tho
wax as has not adhered to the cast is
poured out into the big receptacle used
for that purpose.
The amount of wax that has adhered to
the plaster is generally about an inch In
thickness. The plaster is broken from It
and then the wax !i washed in turpentine
in order that it may be hardened, after
which it is sandpapered. "While the gen
eral contour of the faro has been retained
during this casting process, the eyea and
the mouth must be formed. This is the
sculptor's first task, and he curves thÂ«
opening for the eyes and Inserts the glass
orbs, for the eyes of every figure are of
glass.
It 13 by no means the case that a figure
is always constructed in one piece. Mnrn
often, to expedite matters, the Umba,
trunk and head are cast separately, and
when this is the case, one individual at
tends to each part. When the different
sections of the figure are complete they
are wired together, all but the head and
bust. These are in the hands of a young
woman, who is engaged In putting on th*
hair. Most persons have an idea that wax
figures wear wigs, but they do nothing
of the sort. Each separate hair is fas
tened In as tightly as nature has fastened
the hair on a person. Nor Is the hair man
ufactured. It is all human and comes al
most entirely from Germany.
The task of placing this hair in the fig
ure's head is a rather tedious one. A
needle, just a trifle larger than a hair, Is
used to puncture the wax, and in this
puncture the young woman places the end
of the hair. Then she presses the wax
tightly against it. This process is con
tinued until a regulation head of hair is
affixed. The most delicate task of this
sort is affixing the eyelashes and eye
brows. These are so conspicuous that the
slightest error has an ill effect.
Again, there Is always the danger that
the eyelids will break if the pressure upon
them is too great, and this practically
means the ruin of the figureâ or at least
the head and bust. This work is done, in
every case, with the view of the closest
Inspection being given, and if It is pro
nounced perfect the chances are that any
flaw which exists will be visible only to
the eyes of an expert.
The task of affixing hair, eyelashes and
eyebrows complete, the figure 1b ready for
inspection, and if this is satisfactory it is
shipped to the purchaser. The best of
these figures are so lifelike that if the
light be Otherwise than bright only close
inspection will reveal the fact that the fig
ure is of wax. Of course these works of
artâ for they are nothing elseâ are high
priced and range from $200 to $300.
A fairly good figure can be secured for
a sum considerably lower, but the very
best work always comes high. The $6 sort
are to the figures dsecribed about as the
fearful daubs sometimes termed paintings
are to the work of the brushes of the Aca
demicians. They are cheap, and yet dear
at any price.
The wax used in the manufacture of
these figures in the pure white refined
beeswax. It comes from Texas, Califor
nia and South America, and the average
price Is 20 cents a pound. To make the
head and bust of a figure from eight to
ten pounds of wax are needed, while a
half figure takes from fifteen to seventeen
pounds. The hands and forearms of a fig
ure are generally solid wax, but all the
rest Is a mere shell.
In the studios where these figures are
constructed every nationality is represent
ed that Is ordinarily found in the ranks
of the workers. As no particularly artistic
taste is required to perform the mechan
ical tasks of figure work, there is little
evident among the workmen. The mold
ers, those who put on the hair, eyebrows
and eyelashes, receive from $20 to $24 a
week, as do those who finish and paint the
figures. The other salaries range from
about $10 to 515 per week. The wax re
ceives a certain portion of color when it
is melted by being mixed with artists"
paint, therefore the painting of the figure
consists in the coloring of the features.
All the larger museums of the country
make their own wax figures. Each estab
lishment is presided over by a sculptor of
high ability. Time was when an artist

is the same."
I asked the Wall street veteran if he
had an instance in mind which could
be quoted of a $100,000-a-year man over
spending. Mr. Sage looked as if he
doubted the questioners sincerity, and
then said: "I could name a hundred in
stances, but it would not be charitable
to do so. In a recent caseâ of course
1 shall not mention or indicate any
nameâ a man died who is supposed to
be worth $20,000,000.
"Well, such figures are exaggerated.
Now they are exaggerated, foolishly
exaggerated, in my case. But the world
believes the man I speak of to be worth
many millions, surely."
Mr. Sage regarded the toe of his com
fortable slipper before he added, "I will
not say what my estimate of his wealth

the Indians are not eaters of human flesh.
They eat' raw flesh, however, either of
animals or fish, and esteem burro meat
above all others.
The bucks of the Seri tribe used occa
sionally to visit the Mexican ranches of
Ran Francisco de Costa Rica and Santa
Ana, owned by Don Pascual Enclnas. The
Costa Rica ranch is fifteen miles from the
gulf, and the nearest settlement to Tlbu
ron. Santa Ana ranch is north of Costa
Rica. Both are cattle and horse ranches,
feeding thousands of head. The vaqueros
are young Mexicans and Papago Indians,
with occasionally a Yaqui. The Papagos
have the reputation all through the
Southwest of being the best fighters i
among the Indians. They are better rifle
shots than the Apaches or Seris, and
stick to a trail longer. The Seris are In
mortal dread of the Papagos, for the lat

they are aroused. The Apaches, too, have
been "cleaned out" several times by the

Good Habits.
Keep your brain free from the fumes
of alcohol, your blood free from its
taint. Avoid tobacco, as the poison it
really Is. Keep yourself clean physi
cally and morally. Give your body the
care you would give to any machine of
which you require good work.
Honesty the Best Policy.
There Is no such thing as a trifling
dishonesty, but there may be dishon
esty for a trifling gain, and many a
man has ruined his financial future by
what he felt was a very slight lapse.
I knew of one man who lost a lucra
tive position of trust which he had held
many years, when it was found that
he had had his private account for coal
Incorporated in his employer's bill. I
myself discharged a valuable assistant
who helped himself to my postage
stamps for his own correspondence. At
one timÂ© I was about to embark In a
business venture of considerable mag
nitude with a man who had Impressed
me favorably.
While our arrangements were pend
ing I gave him money to buy for him
self and me two theater tickets. Us
ing my name he secured complimentary
tickets, but took my money and let me
think he had bought them. A casual
glance at the tickets showed me a man
ager's private mark which I recognized,
and I had no more dealings with a
man to whom I had been afcout to en
trust hundreds of thousands of dol
lars. Large employers are obliged to
sift carefully their men and reject the
unreliable.
A Good Name.
Make strictest integrity the rule of
every business art. Do this because it
is right and not solely and chiefly be
cause "honesty is the best policy." If
your word is always"your bond," If no
pleasure nor persuasion will induce you
to be in the smallest degree dishonest,
you have already one of the main ele
ments of success. Strict integrity can
no more be hidden than "love, a cough,
smoke and money," and commands a
price in the labor market proportionate
to its excellence and scarcity. How
rare it Ib, Is perhaps only realized by
digging the first well !n that country, at
Costa Rica ranch, that Pedro Encinas,
son of old Don Pa6cual, almost lost his
life through Seri treachery.
Young Encinas had no help except the
Seris, who at that time frequently crossed
to the mainland in their catamarans at
a place called the EmbÃroadero. The Se
ris profepsfd the greatest friendship with
the white man. But the white man car-
rled a rlfla and six-shooter constantly,
and never permitted a situation where
the Indians would have him at a dis
advantage. For instance, he would never
descend Into the well unless some of the
Indians preceded him. He knew he would
be stoned to death in an instant by the
treacherous brutes. But with some of
their number In the well fie felt safe. In
this manner the well was slowly sunk to
a depth of 150 feet. The only means of
hoisting was a windlass.
One day young Enclnaa had occasion
to ascend to the surface. He stuck his
foot In the rope and gave the signal.
There were two Indians in the well, and
the others were at the top hoisting. When
the Seris had hoisted Encinas half way
they suddenly stopped.
The Mexican Instantly fell a chill of
horror. He knew mischief was brewing,
with his life as the forfeit if the Indians
could catch him napping. But, steady-
Ing his voice, he called out, asking why
they stopped.
large employers looking for trust-wor
thy subordinates and rich men seeking
reliable executors. This comprehensive,
far-reaching quality of unflinching
trustfulness and honesty affects all
who conic In contact with It and Im
plies respect In the most unscrupulous.
Of one of my employes who had this
virtue in Its fullest development. I
could tell many apposite and amusing
stories. Many men are more brilliant,
some are more amiable, but none are
more valued and liked.
On one occasion the giant Chang,
who had lost by death the trusted
agent who had served him for many
years, was referred to this aid of mine
by a candidate for the vacant place.
On asking Mr. as to his knowl
edge of the applicant's character and
capacity, he received the reply "Have
nothing to do with him, he is an un
scrupulous rascal." Naturally, Chang
did not engage the man so described.
Next day the disappointed applicant, in
| great disgust and vexation, accosted
' Mr. with "Why did you say such
! abominable things of me to Chang?"
"Simply," said Mr. , "because
they are true." It sometimes happens
that the canvas men of my great
show and their paymasters do not take
exactly the same view of salaries due,
and many times It has happened that
the dissatisfied person has said, "Well,
I'll leave it to Mr. ; If he says it
is all right, It is right." The value of
a man whose word Is taken unhesi
tatingly by his chief and subordinates
must be apparent to the veriest tyro
in business.
Benefit to Children.
Not only to yourself but to your chil
dren will your good habits, good mor
als and good name be incalculable bles
i sings. We know that unfortunately
goodness is not Invariably transmitted
from parent to child. We see it every
day, and if we were tempted to over
look it, we should be reminded of it by
pessimistic proverbs, apropos of
"black sheep In every fold," "clergy
men's sons," etc. But your son has
just as much chance of inheriting your
moral tendencies as he has of inherit
ing your blue eyes or black hair. His
morals may be the duplicate of yours,
just as much as his physique may.
Tour name, good c-r bad, he must in

know what you are will expect the samn

whatmetal he is made of they will "giv.iÂ«
him the benefit of the doubt," and he
can get a better position and more
easily than a young man of whose fam
ily nothing, or nothing good, is kno/wn.
I could give you many Instances of
this, but one illustration will suffice.
One of my head men has two young
sons. A friend of mine who has gained
great wealth by industry, shrewdness
and that business capacity, one great
element ot which is the power to read
character and determine "who will make
the best employes, offered to the eldest
"No puedo trabajar mas," was the re
ply. "El muchacho muy cansado." ("I
cannot work any more. The boy Is very
tired.")
Young Encinas meantime hung between
top and bottom, facing deafh. He rapidly
surveyed the situation, but saw that he
could do nothing. Thanks to his precau
tion In having the Indians in the well,
he felt assured that the men at the wind
las would not dare to let him drop, thus
killing some of their own people. He
heard, nevertheless, with a great deal of
foreboding, the mutterisgs of the savages
above his head. Finally, after an hour of
horrible suspense, the Indians returned to
the creaking windlass and pulled him out.
Apparently their simple minds saw an
excellent chance to kill him, but they
could not devise the way to do it without
killing some of their own number.
Since the Seris murdered Captain George
Porter and Sailor John Johnson at Tibu
ron Island something over a year ago, the
bucks have kept away from the Mexican
ranches. They stick closo to the island,
and live on fish and turtle. The women
have only recently resumed their visits
to the ranches, to pick up a little prop
erty in the way of cast-off clothing, etc.
On these visits they put on all their cloth-
Ing, leaving none at all on the island.
But at best they are In rags, not sufficient
to hide their nakedness. In squalor and
depth of degradation they cannot be com
pared with any other Indians of the West.
On one of the women recently visiting
the ranch was a large mantle made of
pelican skin. The skins of five or six
pelicans are used to make their wraps.
With these and the hides of wildcats the
Indians manage to cover themselves in
very cold weather. At other seasons they
go naked. They have no houses whatever,
their abiding places being merely tempo
rary camps on the bare ground, with a
campfire sometimes awl sometimes not.
If they are hard pressed for shelter they
take the tops of two adjoining bushes
and draw them together and tie them,
finding a little shelter underneath.
Efforts have been made time and time
again by the Mexicans and by American
scientists to discover the tribal customs
and laws of the Seris. Very little infor
mation is obtainable. This is for the rea
son that no one man. Mexican or Ameri
can, Is safe among the Indians, and the
savages themselves give little light on
their home life. It is known that until
recently there were two chiefs, onch ap
parently with equal powerâ Mata de Maiz
(Corn Stalk) and Pelado (Peeled). Pelado
is dead, and his successor is not known.
So far as ascertainable these chiefs are
the repository of all power. At the same
time the tribe has customs of unknown
antiquity over which the chiefs have no
control.

When A. T. Stewart was in the first
flush of enthusiasm over his plan of
building a model city, he sent for a
skilled architect, a relative of mine, of
whose ability and honesty he had the
highest opinion. Laying before the man
his scheme, dilating on the beauty and
sanitation of which he proposed - to
make his Garden City the incarnation,
he ended by saying: "Now, I want you
to take entire charge of this thing and
carry it through. \ Make the contracts,

out aright, pay all bills, etc." The arch
itect heard him through, then said
very quietly. "Mr. Stewart, the man
you want is doing business for himself."
"Who Is he?" inquired Mr. Stewart
with quick curiosity and the evident
intention of securing him at any price.
"Any man," said the architect, "who
has the knowledge and ability to do
what you require Is inevitably at the
head of an army. of subordinates. ; Such

When a Seri girl arrives at womanhood
she is made to sit at the end of a small
lane made of branches stuck in the
ground, while there Js a feast and dance.
At the end of the dance the girl walks
through the lane and is thus officially
proclaimed a woman and marriageable.
The bucks secure wives by trading skins,
weapons or other valuables for them, the
father of the girl getting all he can and
the lover giving as little as possible.
The Islanders have a stern code some
where in their jurisprudence, as was
shown some years ago when the Mexican
Government took steps to punish them
for the murder of a Mexican citizen. Word
was sent that the murderers must be
surrendered immediately to the Mexican
authorities or the whole island would be
cleaned out. The two chiefs, after vain
parleying, finally replied by sending to
the Mexicans the heads and hands of the
offending tribesmen. They explained that
it was needless to send in the whole body,
as the head would Identify the murderer
and the hand would prove that no more
killing could be done by it.
A number of years ago the Serls klhed
a Mexican woman, whom they had tried
to capture alive. The whole country was
aroused, as this was a repeated offense.
Several Mexican girls had been abducted
by the Indians years before and forced to
live with their savage captors. The leader
of the avenging band of cowboys and
ranchers was Ignaclo Enclnaa, another son
of Don Pascual. It was the boast of this
band that they killed 135 Seris. men,
women and children, in that one day's
hunt. They pursued the Indians to the
island, surprised them and shot them
down like animals. Ignaclo Enclnaa. at
the head of the troop, encountered a
rather comely looking squaw, who was
said to be descended rrom a Mexican
woman captured years before. Rumor
had it that Enclnas was the father of the
papoose she carried. At any rate, when
he strode through the camp she flung the
child up before her. crying:
"Pity! Do not kill your own eon!"
"What does a Seri know of pity?"
shouted Encinas. "This Is the pity I
will give you!" and he slashed them down
with his machete.
Such incidents aa these have had their
influence in preventing the pacification
of the Seris and the opening of the island
to exploration.
The bucks of the tribe are extremely
active and warlike. They like nothing
better than fighting so long as the ad
vantage Is on their side. They will plot
and lie in wait for years in order to re
venge themselves for wrongs real or
fancied. The vaqueros, rounding up their
cattle on the range, sometimes ride with
in sight of the island, but they are ex
tremely cautious when approaching as
close as this. They generally ride in
groups and keep a lively lookout against
surprise. The Seris have a plan of dig
ging little holes in the earth In which
they hide for hours and even days. The
eye glancing over the expanse of sandy
ground broken only by stunted brush sees
no sign of such ambuscades. The murder
of small bands of cowboys has made the
others very alert and watchful.
By some manner, supposedly through
the murder of victims, the Seris have ob
tained possession of a number of rifles.
They cannot get cartridges, however, and
are, therefore, reduced to the exercise of
considerable ingenuity In providing am
munition. They make their own car
tridges by taking pieces of green raw
hide and molding them to the shape of a
cartridge and filling it with powder and
lead, or with a small pebble if lead is
not at hand. For a percussion cap they
take a common parlor match and stick
it in the hole in the end of the cartridge.
They send their women over to the main
land, where they steal or trade for
matches. These cartridges are sometimes
slow in exploding, but they are really
quite successful.
The main weapons of the Seris, how
ever, are bows and arrows and a short
spear, used for catching fish as well as
fighting. The bows are made of the gar
ambullo wood, fortified by rawhide or
deerskin. The arrows are made of the car
riso and are nowadays tipped with iron
or brass, which the Indians get from
wrecked boats, or pick up about the cat
tle ranches. They invariably poison their
arrows for killing their enemies. The poi
son is obtained by hanging up a cow's
liver to putrefy, when the arrows' tips
are dipped in the mass. Sometimes a rat
tlesnake is excited into biting the liver,
thus making the poison more deadly.
Like all wild people, the Seris are en
dowed with strong bodies and great en
durance. They , literally run a deer to
death, and have been known to capture
horses the same way. They take the trail
and follow the animal until it drops of
exhaustion. The Seri's feet are long and
narrow, much unlike the Yaqui's, which
are broad. The Seris are of all sizes, some
of the men reaching a height of almost
seven feet. Most of the men, in fact, are
tall and powerful, while the women are
not above medium height. All paint their
faces with ugly colors.
Of the squaws pictured here only one
could speak Spanish. She was the old
woman with the pelican mantle. The
others spoke the savage tongue only. It
is guttural and entirely unintelligible to
the neighboring Indians. The women are
shrewd and bargain well. They are full
of laughter and ' profess the greatest
friendship for the whites, inviting them
to the island and saying that no harm can
come to them. They are deft in weaving
baskets and bowls of the tender bark ob
tained from the roots of mesquite trees.
Some of these baskets are so made as to
hold water without leaking.
The Seris have peculiar ideas regarding
sickness. They are In mortal terror of it.
Some of them are pockmarked, which
shows that they have struggled through
smallpox unaided. When a member of the
tribe becomes . ill, no matter what his
grade nor the number of his relatives, he
is instantly deserted and left to die or get
well as nature determines. On no ac
count can a Seri be induced to stay and
nurse the sick. At the Mexican ranches,
during a smallpox scare, a Seri became

gome women are as clever and original
when It comes to making a living as other
women are helpless and dull. The frog
farm of Miss Mona Selden. for Instance, is
one of the most unusual business ventures
that any woman was ever laughed at for
making It seems that Miss Selden was
a schoolteacher until a few years ago.
Shlwas probably a good teacher still her
choice of a profession was not exactly
original or uncommon. Not uncommon
ei the? was the ill health which overtook
her in the sober and beaten track of her
duties Perhaps it was a failing appetite
which led her to Inquire the price of
frogs' legs in the market. Perhaps, top.
it was a failing pocket book which made
her meditate ruefully on the price she
heard-meditate ruefully at first but aft
erward with an increasing hopefulness
At any rate. Miss Selden conceived the
Idea of raising frogs' legs^ herself, and
when she began to look for a suitable
place for the experiment she came upon
friendship, New Jersey. Friendship is
surrounded with marshes, bogs and ponds,
and is ideally adapted to frog culture.
The people of that section, however, had
never thought of it in that light; so,
when Miss Selden offered to buy their
landâ which was principally waterâ at 13
an acre, they sold it gleefully, turning
meanwhile a deaf ear to the reproachful
voice of conscience. Then they waited to
see what was going to happen. The first
thing that happened was the fencing in
with wire strands of Miss Selden's newly
acquired property. This caused her neigh
bors to shake their heads, while they
meaningly tapped their own intellectual
brows. It Is said that Miss Selden spent
the winter learning to hit a target the
size of a frog, and succeeded so well that
when spring came she took her rifle and
picked off frogs as easily as she had once
called the roll in her schoolroom. It is
also stated that she has made from $3000
to $5000 a year out of her frog crop, and
that her neighbors have ceased tapping
their brows, and Instead respectfully take
off their hats to her.
Pocket-picking Is an occupation that
admits of a vast display of ingenuity.
While disclaiming any particular merit
for that country, it Is an Indisputable fact
that again England is in the van of all

THE GREEN BROUQHAM
THE estates, properly belonging to the Dowager Marchioness . of
Auriol, herself Baroness de Lys in her own right, were situated
in an outlying part of that western country which is accounted by
Its inhabitants the most beautiful.; She was a handsome woman of
a royal presence, was scarcely 50, acknowledged to less, and still
maintained her position in the world of fashion among younger
and less dignified rivals. Upon this property it was natural that 'Lord
Francis charmian should be supposed to keep an eye. The Marchioness,
herself journeyed in state at intervals into the west, but to her son she
resigned the charges of that territory which should one day be his. Char
mian. however, had an eye and a spirit for the country upon occasion, and
even in the heart of the season was known to have spent a week at the
castle with comfort and entertainment to himself.
But it was naturally in winter that his visits were longest and most
satisfactory. He hunted now and then, and be shot at all times; but his
Irregular seasons had got him the name of eccentricity from the more
rabid partisans of these pursuits. It was, for example, egregious indeed
that Lord Francis should be returning to the castle on a wild January day,
Instead of some three months earlier. Even Lady Auriol had spent her
Christmas in the country, though she had fled to town with her retinue
about the middle of January; but here was the month drawing to a close,
and the future master of the district had only just deigned to descend
upon it from his preposterous amusements abroad.
The castle lies some long miles from the little market town of Lunn.
and only some three from the tiny station at Arraway; yet, as trains to
Lunn are more frequent, it was in the market town that Charmian had
alighted that stark bleak afternoon of January, stiff and cold from his
journey. His carriage was waiting at the station, but, giving the man his
orders, he proceeded on foot briskly toward the "White Hart," followed
respectfully by the brougham. It was now past 3, and he had nothing
to eat since breakfast; consequently he lunched comfortably at the inn.
enjoyed a pint of warm Burgundy, and toasted his feet till half-past 4 or
even later. At that hour, recalling unwillingly the long drive, he rose,
stretched himself, paid his reckoning and went out accompanied by his
obsequious host. As he reached .the landing a sudden outbreak of rude
noise and laughter came down the stairs.
"What's that?" he asked.
The innkeeper looked at him with apologetic eyes. "A party, my lord,"
said he. "I'm afraid it's very noisy. Gentleman's been entertaining some
friends, and, they're â " He hesitated.
"Merry. Cotton?" suggested Charmian; drawing on his gloves. "Don't
be ashamed of it, man." - : .//y ..
"It isn't that, my lord." explained Cotton, with more dignity; "but
I'm afraid his poor lady, who is waiting for him, must be very tired."
"That is very kind of you. Cotton." said Charmian airily, "and If there
was time I should take the liberty of communicating your sentiments. As
It Is you must do it yourself"â and . with a nod he skipped out of the
door and emerged Into the shadows of the falling night. Ere the innkeeper
could recover himself in time to follow (as he would naturally have done)
to assist him into his carriage, Charmian had pulled open the door of the
brougham that stood before the inn, had clapped it to again, and was rat
tling next moment along High street in the direction of the little river
which marks the confines of Lunn. ,W - .
The gray, cold day had broken into a savage evening, and the lamps
twinkled through a drizzle of snow. The light had gone unexpectedly, and
it was impossible to see beyond a yard or so. But presently after, and
when the carriage had crossed the small bridge, turned Into the lane that
branched from the highway, and was fully launched upon its voyage into
the country, there fell a perfect hurricane of snow. The peaceful tenor
of the wind changed; it shook the windows of the brougham, and a stream
of flakes rained thickly upon the road and open fields. Charmian looked
out across the flat, inhospitable meadows. from which the storm was driv
ing. The gusts rustled about the carriage, and he turned complacently
to settle himself into his corner. He put out an arm for a rug which he
had left upon the seat, and to his astonishment his hand came in contact
with something warm and soft. . J---./'
"What the mischief is this?" though Lord Francis. Instantaneously
with the thought he struck a match, and the light flared and rested on the
face and figure of a woman. /â¢/"/;;':. /<-:'.'â ;.'. / . Â"..';â //
She was young and handsome; she lay back with her eyes closed, her
bod;.- nestled in the cushions, and (as Charmian conceived) . his rug dis
posed about her. The light went out, and but for fear of waking' her he
would have whistled. As it was, he sank into his own seat and reflected
on the position with pleasant amusement.' It was plain that the lady must
have mistaken the carriage; and, now he/ considered, there returned to
him. the conversation of old Cotton, and the tale of an unfortunate lady
who was waiting on a merry-making husband. This must be she; and she,
poor creature, had succumbed to the weariness of those long hours and
was delicately enjoying a comfortable slumber in his carriage, and some
two miles upon the road to the castle. The idea tickled him. . ./:/>;
"It. would he a shame to wake her," he thought.' "Heaven be my wit
ness. I am not brute enough for that. The world shall see that I can be
kind to women." With which he folded his arms, cuddled close in his
* corner and shut his eyes. . â  ...
. The rage and blackness of the night increased. The â¢ horses were
brought down to walking pace; the snow encumbered the ground thickly,
and the timid animals slipped and stumbled on the treacherous surface.

.finally one of them came down on' his knees with a Jerk, and the
brougham lurched and shivered. The laidy woke with a cry, and starting
up brushed against Charmian. . -'^ ; ' 'V

asleep. Where are we? .':"â '*/â¢.'
"My dear madam," answered Charmian smoothly, "it is not Fred, but

will light a match, which will enable you to gain a better notion of where

The lady made no answer beyond' a formless ejaculation; and Charmian
struck a second match. He held It before him, and the eyes of the two
met in the light above it.
"Who are you, sir?" inquired the lady In a low voice, but not without
spirit.
."The circumstances," said he gently, "In which I find myself are, I
assure you, not contrived by me. It may seem difficult to believe thatâ
but. my dear madam, consider this. I enter my carriage, I do not perceive
you owing to the dark, and when I make the discovery we are already
miles away from our starting point and I can see no other course than to
let you have your sleep out, and to carry you to some place. from which
you can return in comfort and safety whither you will when the fury of
the storm is dropped."
As he r.poke the match burned his fingers, and he let it drop hastily,
plunging the carriage into darkness.
"But whatâ does all this mean?" cried the lady In bewilderment,
"We must go back. The carriage must turn back."
"My dear lady." paid Charmian soothingly, "it is not a night for a dog
to be out in; and though my coachman is only my coachmanâ" He felt
she had sat bolt upright.
"Sir, I demand that you have the horses turned round," she com
manded, with an' imperious note in her voice.
"Madam, my carriage is at your service," said Charmian, in his finest
Spanish manner, "butâ" <?>"/;///'
He got no further. "Your carriage!" she cried indignantly. "It Is my
carriage." " //<â¢':'â¢
"Pardon me, madamâ he asserted firmly.
"Oh. this is monstrous,": declared the lady. "Either I or you are mad.
Yoii will have it that 1 am your wife next!" she added sarcastically.
"That, madam, is not true." remarked charmian severely; "and to
quiet all your doubts I will light another match."
He struck it on .the Words, and the two pairs of eyes wandered about
the brougham. The lady's danced with anger and triumph, and Char
inian's stared with amazement. The brougham was upholstered In green,
and it was certainly not Us. His gaze returned to hers, which was flushed
and excited.
"A thousand pardons," he begged humbly; "though I have not been
lunching a party of friends, It is inexcusable. The darknessâ the storm
misled me." -/â¢'Vc*/
"And now, perhaps, sir," said the lady with dignity, "you will be good
enough to have the horses turned round." : -"r^
"Certainly," replied Charmian. with the same humility. "The coach
man is yours, madam." lie hesitated with his hand on the door. "But
the question is, where are we? You see, if this is not my carriage, you are
probably safely on your road to your destination."
"True," said she. as if struck by this fact for. the first time. "I had
forgotten."
. "Then may I ask." said Charmian. with some little indignation, "where
the devilâ l beg your pardonâ where that may be?"- â â '.'..;.â¢ â â -
"We live at Sackring." said she, now quite civilly. -
Charmian groaned. "A good dozen miles from my Journey's end," he
murmured. braced himself, "If you will allow me to rap on the glass
perhaps I may best attract the coachman's attention that way."
She hesitated/and then showing -her hesitation in her words, "It is a
terrible night," said she. "It would hardly be fairâ" '
"Oh. what's fair for him is fair for me,", said Charmian cheerfully.
"Besides.: l have deserved it." â  ;â¢ '-/V-.- ' /. - .
"If I might venture to suggest." observed the lady more coldly, "you
had better come on to Sackring. There is a good inn there."
"But yfiur husband?" be asked suddenly.
She paused, stammered, and Charmian would have wagered in the
darkness that she blushed. "Mr. Fletcher," said she, with great dignity,
"will follow, no doubt." - - , . ' .
. But just at that moment and ere Charmian had time to answer the in
vitation thus amicably offered the carriage came, to a stop abruptly, and
each looked out of a window. Upon either side the white waste of a great
moor stretched and relied into the night. The coachman had come down
from his box and appeared before the door by Charmian, a spectacle of
gleaming snow. He turned the. handle and peered in, putting a finger
mechanically to the snow that was his hat.
"Beg pardon, sir, but I've lost my way," says he. >: /â¢/-I.'
Mrs. Fletcher made an exclamation. "Good heavens! James, you can't
mean that?" she cried. "Whore are we?" V :
"Can't exactly make out. ma'am," said James in perplexity. "I know
we're en the moor, but the roads have t^me. and from the way the horses
are plunging I fancy we're on a side track." â¢ "â¢ /
- "You must find the road at once," commanded the lady in consterna

to be. ::.;: -. " /
"Ohâ of courseâ yes," stammered Mrs. Fletcher. , "Well, your master
will think it over and. let you know presently." And then. upon. the with

to do? He thinks you are Mr. > Fletcher." . :...'*.-.
"Let him think so," said Charmian promptly.

"Butâ " She hesitated. . - \ ; ir"* v *'"V. iW i.
"My dear lady, the first part (and it Is of prime importance) is that we
should get somewhere. The night is wild; if I am a judge of the sky, it
is beating up for worse; and to. lie here twittering about points of eti
â quette in the drift would expose us to death of cold, hunger or suffoca
tion. James must drive on." ...
â¢ The decision was communicated to the coachman, and the carriage
painfully resumed its jolting journey. The lady had grown submissively
meek and silent. She began to be alarmed; and only by a start or an
exclamation of anxlotv at each deeper plunge or rougher Jolt did she
break the stillness of the interior. Charmian sat back; he was very cold,
and he was very tired, and he saw no prospect of dining. He was out of
patience with the lady. In this neutrality of silence more than half an
hour elapsed, upon the end of which the carriage drew up once more and
James appeared at the door. Â!â¢' i!. Â ,_ Â±*. . A ,
"We've got somewhere, sir," said he, respectfully but triumphantly.
Charmian looked out. and through the streaming flakes beheld the
feeble light of a wayside inn. His heart warmed within him.
"James mustn't see you," whispered the lady In his ears in an agitated
voice. â¢ ' " . " 'â â â 'â â 
Charmian had forgotten. "Not he," he Bald cheerfully, and opening
the further door hopped lightly into the night. The lady descended with
more leisure, and Charmian dodged into tho inn. He met the landlord
bustling to the doorway. â â¢-â â â ';â 
"Aâ a lady and Iâ that Isâ have been caught in the storm, he ex

The landlord gave a phlegmatic assent, his eyes observing the lady
where she stood, her garments flecked with white ,and her face warm from
tho thrashing winds. She hung back, but Charmian took her arm and
bowed her with stiff courtesy into the coffee-room.
The door once shut, Mrs. Fletcher turned quickly round. "Understand
this," she said, showing a hotter face; "I cannot dine with you."
â  "But, my dear lady, exclaimed Charmian, "we must have food, and we
came together; It's plain we cannot dine apart, or we shall raise suspi
cions."
"I will pot dine at all." she said firmly.
Charmian shrugged his shoulders in despair, while he observed her
more nearly.* She was tall and youngâ some five and twenty, as he guessed
Â«he owned a pair of fine eyes, and her complexion was delicately pink.
A spirit flashed in her handsome face, which changed swiftly with the
vicissitudes of her emotions. She confronted him now with anger and
resolution alike conjoined in her features and sparkling In her eye.
"My dear Mrs. Fletcher," he said gently, "of one thing I am certainâ
that you shall dine if I have to walk all the way back to Lurtn."
She was silent a moment, and thenâ "But you could never do that,
she murmured in another tone. "I don't want to drive you away. You
see mv position." she added appealingly; "I don't even know your name.

WHILiE making a search through the Polar re
gions for traces of the balloonist Andree the
expedition under Professor A. C. Nathorst also
made a most thorough exploration of the places
visited. The result Is a most valuable ad
dition to scientific knowledge. Many of the facts obtained
are surprising in more ways than one. A report of this
expedition has Just been received at the Academy of Sci
ences in this city and Is attracting much attention on ac
count of Its unlooked for array of new discoveries.
Perhaps the most surprising statement made in the
whole report is the fact that the greatest energies of the
expedition were devoted to a search for microbes over the
fields of Ice. This is the first time that such work has been
done, and the results are sure to be of the greatest benefit
to hiimanity. As a search after microbes the expedition
was both a success and a failure. It was a success be
cause It showed that the air of the Polar regions is the
purest to be found on the face of the earth. . It was a
failure because no microbes were found.
The preparation for this work was about as complete
as it could bo. Several bacteriologists were employed, and
the laboratory on board the steamer AntarcUc was sup
plied with every possible piece of apparatus. Test plates
of gelatine were carried to the tops of icebergs and ex
posed to the air, on all the islands the same work was
done the water of the sea was examined, and no microbes
were found. The stomachs of seals, birds and fishes were
also examined, and all that came to light was one harmless
microbe, such as can be found in the stomachs of human
beings almost any day. j "
It was demonstrated conclusively that the air or tne
Polar regions is absolutely bacterium proof. This was
further proved to the members of the expedition by the
fact that none of them "took cold." On two occasions
Professor Nathorst fell into the icy water, but he felt no
evil effects beyond the immediate chill. On one of the oc
casion* he was compelled to stay in his wet clothes for
a couple of hours. He suffered severely from cold, but
as soon as he got back to the ship and put on dry garments
he felt as well as ever he did isi his life. In a temperate
climate, where microbes are plentiful, he would most cer
tainly have experienced a long siege of sickness.
The fact that the Polar regions are healthful has been
known to the people of Sweden for several years. At
Advent Bay. Spitzbergen Island, Professor Nathorst found
a health resort in the shape of a good-sized hotel. The
structure, he says, is the northernmost building, excepting
the huts of Indians, to be found in the world. It is close
up to the eightieth parallel, and for the greater part of
the year is burled In snow and ice. But sick people get
well there Professor Nathorst met several consumptives
who had been at the hotel only a short time but were able
to report a large gain in weight and a marked improvement
in general condition. ....
Professor Nathorst made the first landing of which there
is any record on Charles XII Island, far to the north of
Spitzbergen. Here he found a sheltered valley with a
scrubby growth of timber. This was a surprise, but he
received his greatest shock when a couple of large rein
deer wandered up to him without showing any signs of
fear Tha animals had never before seen a human being,
and they were bo tame they could be stroked like pet
While voyaging over the ice fields in the steamer the
expedition ran into an icepack that was being heaved about
by a mighty ground swell. The ice rose and fell on giant
rollers, and the ship crunched her way over this In constant
danger of being crushed to splinters. But Professor
Nathorst says that, In spite of this danger, the tossing
fields of ice presented the. grandest scene he ever saw.
Besides making careful examination of several small, un
known islands the expedition explored the eastern shore of
Spitzbergen' lsland, where the foot of white man had never
trod before. The climate was frightfully severe even in
the summer, but the explorers were rewarded by discover
ing enormous ledges of excellent coal. The amount in
sight Indicated the value of the fields to be millions. Judg
ing by the other coal fields which have been found on the
northern shores of -Europe, these could not be exhausted
In hundreds of years. . ,;
The explorers found several beetles in localities where
none were supposed to exist. A- few small animals were
also found, and a large quantity of botanical specimens
were secured. Deep-sea soundings were made, and several
unexpected facts were thereby brought to light.
The Swedish Geographical Society looks upon this ex
pedition .as the most successful ever sent to the Polar re
gions. The- report Just issued is a long document and can

THE SA^ FKANOISCO CAI/L, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1899.
with Ice until late In the season, has rarely been visited and re
mained almost unexplored. The Antarctic, a steamer specially
built for Arctic explorations, has been purchased for the expe
dition and fitted out with the latest Improvements for scien
tific work.
The first object of visit was Beeren Eiland, an Isolated
Island midway between Norway and Spitzbergen. This Island
had previously been very Imperfectly known geologically as
well as geographically, and several weeks were spent in re
searches by the various members of the expedition. The Island
is almost inaccessible on account of its steep sides and lack of
proper harbors. In many places the sides rise precipitously
1200 to 1500 feet above the ocean.
Geologically this Island Is one of the most Interesting places.
Professor Nathorst sums up its history as follows: "During
the Silurian period the now island was a deep sea in which were
Blowly deposited strata of such low animals as trilobites and
mussels characteristic of the period. These strata became later
strongly folded and rose above the surface of the sea. After
hundreds of thousands of years this land was again depressed
below the sea and the rivers of the neighboring continent de
posited layers of sand, with remains of vegetation and other
fossils, which now constitute the carbonfferous formations of
the island. Hundreds of thousands of years passed by and
again the sea rose and its bed became dry land. How long this
lasted it is impossible to know, but later on the land tank and
became a pemlan tea with new carboniferous deposits contain
ing the characteristic animal 3 of that period. The many re
mains of corals which constitute the mass of Mount Misery
were deposited at that time. The coal deposits on the island
are of the highest importance, and it is only a question of time
v.htn they will be utilized. They are, indeed, too valuable to
remain long neglected. * â¢ *
"In the far north the outlook had signaled ice floes, and dur
ing the night we were suddenly warned of their presence. A
heavy shuck to the vessel and ah ominous grating were the first
signs, so well known from previous experiences In the polar
seas. I rushed on <\eck at once and found that we were well in
among the ice. The sun shone brightly, though in the middle of
the night, and on every side were thousands of ice blocks of a
brilliant whiteness, with sides of the purest blue and green. A
morp magnificent sight cannot be imagined. We were now
breaking through the outer ice. which is a little thicker than
the inner. With a good ice vessel like our Antarctic such a trip
i* on<? n"ver to be forgotten, one of unmlngled pleasure, of new
and unexpected charm at almost every turn. When the ice is
less dense you go between the larger ice blocks, pushing the
smaller ones aside. When It is denser you have to break your
way through with the iron-shod prow. During sunny weather
you may see the seals everywhere on the ice hlocks sunning
themselves, while the Arctic seagulls, with their brilliantly
white wings, sail undisturbed in all directions. A peculiar phe
nomenon in these regions is the ice-blink, an undescrlbahle
glimmer in thQ air a.nd sky wherever the solid ice pack in near.
Whenever this glimmering light was seen we knew that our
journey in the direction of the light was at an end, as a vessel,
however strongly built, can no more penetrate this ice than it
couW go through solid reck. â¢ â¢ â¢
â "Midsummer eve was one of the most charming days Im
aginable. The sun shone with its brightest rays; the tempera
ture in the shade was 45, while In the sun it was 75. We had
changed our course, and our objective point was Stans Fore
land, in front of Stor-FJord, the largest bay on Spitzbergen.
When we cast anchor In Recherche Bay I decided to remain
there some two or three weeks in order to give opportunity to
the scientific staff to investigate thoroughly the fauna and flora,
both living and of the fossiliferous strata, for the latter are
known to be among; the very richest In fossils In the world.
The anchorage was so secure that we could extinguish the fire
under the boilers and save our coal.
"The shores of the two main bays were mapped and found
to be very different in shape and size from what they had pre
viously been reported. Geologically this part of Spitzbergen
is most interesting. We discovered here the Arctic strata pre
viously known only on Greenland. The tertiary formations,
which we found in abundance, were wonderfully rich In vege
table fossils. These strata contain an endless store of petrified
eaves and fruits of such trees as magnolias, lime treefc, swamp
LARGEST RANCH IN THE WORLD.
It Covers More Territory Than the States of Rhode Island and Delaware and Thousands of Cattle
Roam Over It.
w T seems natural that the largest
I ranch in the world should be found
I In the largest State In the Unionâ
I Texas. Indeed, this ranch Is so ex-
JL tensive that some States could not
contain it. Connecticut, for example,
could not hold It by several thousand
acres. The two States of Rhode Island
and Delaware combined could not contain
this immense ranch, which consists of
over 3.000,000 acres, or almost 5000 square
miles.
About a dozen years ago, when Texas
needed a new State Capitol, the Legisla
ture adopted a novel plan to get it. A
promise was held forth that a vast tract
of unappropriated land would be given in
exchange for a suitable granite building
at Austin. Among those tempted by this
offer were ex-Senator Charles B. Farwell
and his brother John, who ultimately
formed a syndicate in Chicago and took
upon themselves the responsibility of
erecting the proposed capltol. Their part
of the agreement appears to have been
carried out to the satisfaction of the
State, and in due time they came Into
the possesssion of the immense domain
now known as the X. I. T. ranch.
The ranch is situated in the extreme
northwest corner of the Panhandle of
Texas, and covers or touches nine differ
ent counties. Its northern boundary is
"No Man's Land," now a part of the Ter
ritory of Oklahoma, and its western limit
Is the line between Texas and New Mex
ico. In width (from east to west) It aver
ages about twenty-five miles. In length
it is about 200 miles. The land lies in
what is known as the Staked Plains, a
high plateau. The soil Is mostly of a
black or chocolate colorâ very fertile,
and covered with a thick coat of buffalo,
mesquit, grama -and other grasses
whicty cure on the ground and furnish
winter as well as summer pasturage for
stock of all kinds. At the southern end
of the tract the altitude Is about 2300 feet,
and at the northern end about 4700. The
climate is pronounced to be generally de
lightful, the air being bracing though
dry.
When the Farwells obtained the land
they inclosed It with a substantial barbed
wire fence. There are many cross fences
upon it, separating the territory into from
twenty to thirty large divisions, besides
many small ones. To make these fences
It required just fifteen hundred miles of
barbed wire. The syndicate also built
ranch houses, bored and 1 , dug wells, of
cypress .alders, etc., showing what wonderfully rich vegetation
existed in ages gore by in these now inhospitable regions.
"We had here splendid opportunity to hunt. The reindeer
were so tame that they came up within a few feet of the rifles,
and we had no difficulty in getting all the meat we wanted. I
need hardly state that we did not kill more than was necessary
for our table.
"Our work successfully finished in the vicinity of Recherche
Bay, we steamed for Belsound and Advent Bay, where we ar
which there are now about three hundred,
averaging one hundred and twenty feet
In depth and having earthen or wooden,
reservoirs and drinking: trough attach
ments; erected windmills over the wells;
built dams across arroyos to conserve the
rainfall, and in various other waya made
the place suitable for a ranch. They
placed cattle upon it as fast as it could
be put in safe condition to receive them,
and have since continued to add to the
herd from time to time by purchase and
breeding until they have at present about
120,000 cattle, besides almost 1600 horses.
The calf crop branded in 1897 exceeded
31,000 head. The whole property is val
ued at $10,000,000.
These figures afford an Idea of the ex
tent of the business. The Farwells at
tend to the chief affairs of their office in
Chicago, but have a general ranch man
ager at the ranch headquarters, which
is situated at Channlng, in Hartley
County. Manager Boyce has supervision
over the whole property, being assisted
by seven foremen, each one of whom is
responsible for one of the principal divis
ions. Each of these divisions of Itself
would form a large ranch.
There are raised on these plalnÃ three
breeds of cattleâ namely, Hereford, Ab
erdeen, Angus and Durham. At the pres
ent time the herd Is unequaled, It Is be
lieved, either In quality or size, anywhere
In the United States. The hundreds of
horses are bred, not, as may be supposed,
for the market, but rather for service
in traveling between widely separated
points on the ranch. No sheep are raised.
When the cattle have reached such a size
as to become marketable they are cent
to Chicago. Not all stop there, however,
as many go still farther East, and are
eventually shipped to distributing points
in Europe.
One of the surprising things In connec
tion with the enterprise is the fact that
all the duties are performed by a force
of about a hundred and twenty-five men,
or an average of only one man for every
24,000 acres. There are houses, barns, etc.,
at the seven division headquarters, as well
as line camps, where there are smaller
buildings. The men assigned to the camps
repair the fences, oil the hundreds of
windmills, and busy themselves in other
work of this sort. Some of the squads
have no house in which to stay, but are
provided with a "chuck" wagon to carry
their food and beds as they move from
place to place. All are fed by the com
pany, each division having freight wagons
to haul supplies from points on the rail
road where they are bought. The three
divisions at the southern end trade at
Amarlllo, Potter County; the other four
at Charming.
One might naturally Imagine that the
yearly loss of cattle- would be enormous.
As a matter of fact it Is not, being only
from 2 to 5 per cent. The loss Is chiefly
due, not to disease, as may be supposed,
but rather to the occasional severe
weather In winter.
In' these days of general dependence
upon all possible means of quick commu
nication ft may afford relief to some wor
ried and wearied business men to know
that on the largest ranch In the world the
telegraph is not used and the telephone is
a stranger, neither being considered as
necessary- Barring such few messages as
are sent by horsemen to points near by,
all the communications go by mail, as
there are postofflces nearer to several of
the division headquarters than Channlng
is. Payments to employes and others are
made monthly at the main office in Char
ming, where .the company's accounts are
all kept.
As has been stated, the X. I. T. ranch
has, with its 5000 square miles, an area
greater than that of Connecticut, or of
Rhode Island and Delaware combined; for
Connecticut, it may be stated for the ben
efit of those who are fond of exact fig
ures for purposes of comparison, has only
4750 square miles, Delaware 2120 and
Rhode Island 1306. After a moments study
of these statistics the question naturally
may be asked, "How many towns orother
settlements are there in all this vast
area?" There are two, and only two:
Channlng, where the general manager
lives, and Texline, In Dallara County.
Both towns contain hotels, stores and
schools, but nowhere else on the ranch
is there any settlement.â lndies' Home

course of time men become philosophical
even in love affairs.
"So you have decided that you cannot
marry me," he Baid.
"Sir!" she replied, "I have decided
nothing of the kind. I can marry you

as you well know. What I have decided
is that you cannot marry me."â Chicago

The average \ amount â¢of â  sickness in
human life Is nine days out of the year,:
rived on July 17. At this place is situated the most northern
hotel In the worldâ the Tourist Hotelâ where travelers and ex
plorers may receive all the comforts and most of the luxuries
of civilised life. In the vicinity of the Ice Fjord we found two
species of beetles, a discovery which was the more important
as no beetles had theretofore been found on Spitzbergen.
"Our next work was bounding the great deep known as the
Swedish Deep, on the western side of Spitzbergen. "When we
began this work, on July 14. we found at once to our great sur
prise that the Gulf Stream had modified the temperature of the
water to the enormous depth of 1200 feet. When the same local
ity -was explored in IS9O it was found that the water of the Gulf
Stream spread only on the surface, while comparatively a few
feet below the water of the ocean was icy cold. Great changes
must have taken place in comparatively few years, and it is
easy to foresee the tremendous effect such change in tempera
ture must have upon the animal life of the ocean. Millions
upon millions of f.shes unaccustomed to the warmer water must
have suddenly perished or b<-"-'n driven away, while other, more
southern specie?, have taken their place. This spread of the
Gulf Stream accounts for the vpt>- favorable climatic condi
tions enjoyed by the more northern latitudes during the last
few years.
"In the vicinity nf Prince Charles Foreland we found by
sounding that the greatest depth reached was 1500 feet. From
these great depths large collections of deep-sea animals were
brought to the surface and preserved for future study.. The
lnst soundings were taken along the large ice pack known as
the Greenland Ice park, on account of its being driven by the
currents from the polo southward along the east coast of
Greenland. It is this same ice rack that carried Nansen'y
steamer Fram diagonally across the polar sea. This ice pack
was now carefully Investigated in order to ascertain if it is
derived fro mthe Siberian polar sea. as Nansen suspected. Our
investigations arc, however, not finished.
"The time v. as now at hand when we had to attempt to
reach King Charles Land, and I accordingly changed the course
toward the east In order to take advantage of the more free
passage south of Spitzbergen. We had, however, to force our
way for several days through an ice pack of no inconsiderable
thickness. But our steamer surmounted all obstacles, and the
4th of Aogust found us in open water in the vicinity of King
Charles Land. For twenty-eight years I had constantly hoped
some time VT be able to explore this land, which so many harl
attempted to reach without success, and now, when we had
pushed our way to its very shores. I was sorry that the diffi
culty of reaching it had not been greaterâ the effort seemed to
me altogether too t;imp. We found that King Charles Land
consists of two principal islandsâ the Swedish Foreland and
King Charles Island, with Johnsens Mountain. Geologically
speaking, the Swedish Foreland belongs to the Jura formation,
overlaid by basalt. During the great ice age this island was
submerged and rose at a later date. It is thus much later than
Spitzbergen. On King Charles Island we found the upper table
lands actually covered with enormous quantities of driftwood,
which must have remained here many thousands of years
without decaying. Many of the trunks had become petrified,
and some measured as much as three feet in diameter. Much
of the snow on this Island was pre^n and red, caused, of course,
by microscopic algae of various ppecies, specimens of which
were collected for future investigations. During- our several
weeks' stay on these islands we brought together various and
valuable collections of minerals, fossils, plants and animals,
and the two Islands were carefully surveyed and mapped. â¢ â¦
"I thought it best to make an effort to reach the mysterious
White Island, to the north of King Charles Land, of which so
much had been surmised and so little was really known. We
therefore started north. On the 18th of August we noticed a
peculiar glimmering at the horizon, which later in the day
proved to be nothing but the snow and ice-covered sides of
White Island. The Island proved to be entirely covered with
ice and snow, except for a small narrow band along some parts
of the shore. The walls were precipitous, and their broken sides
dropped from time to time as Icebergs into the sea. We landed
at two places and explored the shores, but were prevented from
staying by the ice, which closed around the island from all
sides. The highest latitude reached on our trip was 81 deg. 14
mln. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Not the least Interesting results were those achieved by the
bacteriologist. The air was filtered in all the various localities
visited and tested for bacteria. The results were certainly most
Interesting and remarkable. It was ascertained that bacteria,
the bane of all temperate and tropical climates, are absolutely
absent from the Arctic air. Not a single bacterium was found
during the whole voyage, the air being- absolutely free and
pure. The stomachs of birds and mammals killed were also
examined bacteriologically, with most unexpected results. In
the intestines of the birds, with one single exception, not one
bacillus was found, while in the bears and the seals were found
only very few of a variety similar to those existing in man.
Even the water was found to be almost free from bacteria, and.
on King Charles Land we found that It contained at the most
only one bacllluf to each eleven cubic ctnttjneiers.''

-The trouble has all been caused by tne
extravagance, dishonesty and recWessneai
of the -Id board." says ElishaWÃrootaJ.
the veteran principal of the Girls' High
School, "and now the old rascals are
chuckl n ff because they go scot free while
tho tf*u-hers are suffering. The tough old
board: was not a circumstance to the last
one. Cl Is a pity we can't get at them and
punish the guilty parties."
That Is the way most of tho teachers
talk about the late board. One remarked
Harcasftically: "Its memory has been per
petuai hy naming "no school the Bar
rtngtoji School. 1 think w* ought also to
have a Waller School in this city."
It was on the afternoon of November SO
that tli? teachers first gathered on a quick
Bummorw in Golden Gate Hall and np
pointed a.n utlve oommlttee. consist

nic Bchool! AJbert w. Lyser. principal of

Manning, principal of the Webster, and
Miss Kjnma E. Stlncen. principal of the
"WhittiiM-. This committee was instructed
to engage legal counsel and go into the
court* with their November salary
c'.aim.s. The teachers taxed themselves
1 per cent of their salaries for a defense
fund.
For the old board, upon nearing the end
ct Its reckless extravagance and finding a
vast shortage about to be disclosed, had
decided to pay all the Bupply and similar
bills that they had been piling up and to
let the teachers wait and get their sala
ries - me time, if they could. The teach-.
<?rs have occasionally had to wait a
ir.omh or several months for a small part
cf their salaries, when deficits had oc
curred, but there was never a fear that
their money would not be paid in time..
Tho board had always approved the sal
ary warrants, wnich the teachers could
keep or discount until the Auditor would
allow them to be paid, thus having a rec
ognized claim for what was due them.
But this time the board, on the night he
fore the mass meeting, resolved to "with
hold" the November salaries, thus defl
nitey denying payment until the end of
the fiscal year, June 30 next, when they
â were to be paid out of any money remain-
Ing in the treasury. Tho board, in fact,
porposed to pay its extravagant supply
bills and consign the teachers and a big
deficit to luck and the next boaiÂ»i. They
would not even "pass" the salary war
rants and thus give the teachers a piece
of paper which would be a certificate of
indebtedness.
The teachers paw that their monpy was
being diverted from them and that their
ever petting: it would be doubtful, and
they also foresaw what happened later.
their December salaries would be
treated in the same way. The salaries of
ira were includp^d, and the whole
amount for two months was a little less
than J200.000. The teachers' salaries for
November amounted to $58,609 SO. and for
December to $90,737 10.

SARAH BERNHARDT
AS SHE IS AT HOME
By Algernon Shaw, Who Acted as Her Secretary.
THE "Divine Sarah" is said to be
contemplating a trip through India,
to shoot tigers, elephants, snakes
and Incidentally to captivate the
hearts of the susceptible rajahs.
Her travels have, been numerous.
Bhe is always on the go, and you cannot
tell any more than you can tell where the
pea is in a shell game where she will bob
up next.
I know whereof I speak, for I have trav
eled much with her. I had the honor â
pome would pay the misfortune â to be for
fnme time her private secretary, cable
dispatcher and general man of affairs.
For the average theater-goer she may
he the "Divine Sarah," but after having
known her well under her different lights
and shades, moods' and passions, the best
term I find for her is "the Feline Sarah."
An extraordinary woman in everything,
her temper was most disconcerting while
I traveled from city to city with her.
I remember one evening in New York,
â when playing: "Glsmonda" at the Empire,
nfter the third act everything seemed to
have pone wrong, and I could see the
etorm brewing under her expressive face.
The curtain came down amid the usual
ovations, then up it went, she smiling
with a grace and abandon to drive the
bald head crowd to untold foolishness.
The curtain eaxne down again, and then
the storm broke. Her teeth clenched, her
eyes flaming, she went to her room, say
ing, "Bring me the four Barons and a few
other idiots."
I sat in my little corner, a very meek
young man. All that stagy grace was
goi.o from her. but she was superb in her
angerâ an anger real and divested of art.
In came the four Barons, she berating
each in turn as to his manner of playing,
repeating his lines and showing 1 him how
he should have said them.
"AJlez et tachez de faire mieux," she
paid, "Go and do better," as a Parthian
6hot.
Her voice in these moments of anger
lost its sweet tone. No longer what her
admirers call "La voix dor"ât he golden
voiceâ it was metallic, steely, vibrating.
Her eyes, large and gray, had the fascina
tion of a snake, the cruelty of a tiger.
They were beautiful; you feared and ad
mired their gaze, which seemed to pene
trate you like a blade.
She camo to this country in February,
under Abbey, Shooffel and Grau, for
a four months' tour through New York,
Montreal, Boston, Philadelphia, Xew Or
leans, St. L,ouis and Chicago. She could
not talk English, and on this voyage I
had to interpret all the gushing mes
sages, whether verbal or written, and
stand guard over her sanctum.
. The women brought flowers, which she
received with graceful languor. There
would be photographs with the flowers.
For the autograph cranks, for every one,
ehe had a kind wordâ when they were in.
Consequently there used to be amusing
ucenes of human vanity as the lucky ones
ewellerl and passed haughtily by those
lees favored.
Struggles of the Teachers to Set Their Salaries
important points that the one-twelfth act
applies to the Board of Education, and
that the teachers' salaries are not stat
utory and hence cannot be paid out of
the funds of the next fiscal year, as had
been frequently done. Hence it was or
dered that whatever of six-twelfths of the
appropriation remained in the treasury on
December 31 should be divided pro rata
among the salary and all other claims.
As another result of the ruling that -
the salaries were not statutory, it was
found that $113,000 paid the teacher* In
August on account of June aalarlea wu
illegnlU- paJd, and that this sum must be
deducted from the Falary claims of No
vember and December. The result would
be that the teachers would get a few
cents on the dollar, that practically all
of their November and December salaries
would be Irretrievably lost. No prospect of
gettinp the salaries for those two months
is yet in sight, and the teachers are still
in the legal predicament of having looted
the city treasury last August of $113,000,
which they owe to the city and which
they must pay back, though really in
common honesty the city owes them the
amount, and more. And their share of
the balance in the treasury on December
31, yet tied up by the litigation, will not
be enough to meet this legal debt. What
they got last August they honestly earned
and had to wait for. and it was spent
months ago, hut now they have to pay it
back and lose more besides, because there
is not enough money legally available to
pay the balance that would be due them
out of their November and December sal
aries. There is a grimness about that
phase of their troubles.
The merchants brought an Injunction
suit, and the teachers brought another,
and there have been orders, demurrers,
writs and postponements galore. That is
the situation of theNnvember and Decem
ber salary account now, with a possibility
<<f s ;ine understanding with the outside
creditors being readied.
Then late in January, nearly three
months since a dollar had been paid the
teachers, the Auditor decided not to pay
January salaries until any balance due on

rid of them. She told the women how
she liked the American women. Most
stupid questions I had to Interpret. Some
young men would come and stammer
something about beautiful, grand and-
collapse und stare! The men were pref
erable, using more tact, more discretion,
although there were painful exceptions.
After they were gone she would cry:
"Ouf! They are gone. Quirk, Cocotteâ
powder, dress and my wraps! That old
idiot of a Piron has been railing me. for
the first act." She was not punctual, but
very particular in her make-up, very con
scientious and a strong advocate of stage
realism.
I Bitting among the pillow? on the sofa,
pad in hand, she would dictate to mo hor
answers to letters. Some were begging.
others admiring, some wanted to name a
mare after her. She would laugh and
say: "If I gave to all whn asked 1 would
soon be poor myself. Throw them in the
basket."
But most of the letters were simply
written to get an autograph, and some
must have ground their teeth when they
got my illegible signature.

sign herself, such as the beautiful one of

Her skin was white, of a milky white
ness which is observed in red headed peo
ple, without the freckles. Her hair was
of a beautiful Titian red. but it was dyed
to that color. It was heavy and short,

This was a disheartening blow, but a few

salaries were ordered paid. The new Board
of Education had reduced January sala
ries 20 per cent, and so, after waiting
over three months, the teachers and jan
! cepted, showing her extraordinary stam
; ma and endurance.
Her affection for her son Maurice was
great, and T remember cabling money to
him from Montreal at her request. A
great deal of the money she made went
to Buppori and help him in his theatrical
ventures, buying him a theater at the age
of 18.
She was very strict at rehearsals, and
would herself set the example. Khe would
work continuously, rising at about 10
o'clock, from thai hour to 12 having re
ports brought to her and receiving a few
callers. Tin n she had lunch, or what the
French call "dejeuner a ta fonrchette."
She would not drink while eating, saying
it was conducive to stoutness, and she
was afraid of that for her stage career.
She would rehearse from 1 o'clock till 5
if no matinee prevented. She would fine
any one not there, and it was a high treat
to see her recite her roles and help the
weak ones. Her memory was wonderful,
anrl she could learn her role in two or
three clays in an emergency. One of her
favorite places of solitude and retirement
when she wanted to learn a role was her
studio. Nobody dared interrupt her.
Hardly eating from suppressed excite
ment, she would walk up and down the
floor, talking aloud, gesticulating, speak
ing aloud, and I have actually seen her
cry in one of her rolesâ La Tosca. The
tension, she said, prostrated her. and she
would come into her room with tears
streaming down.
Bhe would use very crude language
sometimes, but it was always to the point
and in French, which, like Latin, the
French say, braves honesty. She had a
leading manâ Darmandâ tall and hand
some, but I remember her telling him:
"Darmand, all these females will spoil
you by their incense and flattery-" It
may be presumed they have, for he start
ed the Theater Libre in Paris In opposi
tion to her La Renaissance.
She is a woman of strong character and
does not easily forgive or forget, as I
saw often. The parasites following her
the world over cordially detested each
other, and she would say, "I have a great
time keeping my snake family quiet!"
Among these constant companions of her
whom her insight or kindness brought
out of obscurity were Suzanne Taylor, her
closest companion; Clairie Louise Abberna,
whom she made celebrated as an artist
by painting her, and several others more
ornamental than useful. She is the fairy
godmother of all who show talent,
whether young or old, and many a young
man she has helped to rise to fame.
But, like the Parisians, she must
have a new idea or new hobby to-morrow.
Continually on the go, on the breastworks,
in the battle for artistic supremacy, she
forgets her friends, being ungrateful to
some like Yaun Nibor, the sailor poet; and
hating others like Yvette Guilbert, the lit
tle songstress, as she calls her, and Re

had traveled in a wagon, peddling by the
way. from Monterey to Hollister. There
his asthma became so bad that he turned
his horse loose, sold the broken-down
wagon, and with the proceeds came to
the city to seek relief in the hospital.
Because he was almost a centenarian
he attracted the attention of the officials
at the hospital. For, despite the fact that
he is almost 99, his eye is bright and his
brain clear. But his speech is impeded by
the dreadful asthmatic attacks and his
tongue does not lend itself as easily to
English as to Spanish.

"I remember It was just after my
ith birthday." said Sebastian, in re
counting; how he came to California in
ISI2. "that I was down at the wharf in
Montreal. Some sailors asked me if I
would like to go on board their ship. I
was ful! of curiosity ainl of course I said
They took me into the cabin and
mo nuts and candy to eat and
strange shells to play with. This was
part of their trick to kidnap me and use
me as a cabin boy.
"I fell asleep, and when I awoke I felt
terribly sick. After we had been out to
sea a few days I got over the seasick
ness. Then I began to cry for my father
and mother. I wanted to play with my
little brothers and sisters. But the cap
tain told me it would be a long time be
fore I would see them again. He said
we were going to a strange country
called California. The captain was an
Englishman, but many of the sailors
spoke French, and as my parents were
French-Canadians and I could speak the
language they grew very fond of me.
Every one was very kind to me. I never
forgot the name of the captain nor the
ship's name. It was thÂ»- Colombo and
the Captain's name was Umphrey.
"It seemed years to me before I woke up
one morning and found that we were not
moving. Soon some sailors took me on
shore. There was just one house in sight,
and to that we went. That was the first
house on the spot that afterward became
San Francisco. While the sailors were
bartering for hides and tallow I talked
with the padre. He was French and the
only one who could understand me. Tho
rest of the people on shore were Mexi
cans. I told him my name and then he
made me tell him all about the sailors
taking me from Montreal.
"There was a tall dark gentleman in a
big sombrero who stood near us and lis
tended to -what we said. The father spoke
to him in Spanish and the gentleman pat
ted my head and smiled at me.
"After supper the padre asked me If I
would like to go with the gentleman. I
said 'yes,' and that very night I was put
on a horse and rode away with the gen
tleman. We traveled for several days.
"It was Senor Pacheco, father of Ro

his ranch. I soon learned to talk Span

from the curious little wagon in which I
was riding, the queer little people swarm

five-story pagoda and the old medieval
castle, seemed nothing less than marvel

the country for fifty years tne wonder
of it would oever pass away. But it was
the same old story. I actually lived there
only four years, and long before I left I
could rid<- from end to end of the great
city of Tokio without a single thrill of
wonder. Our own land, our streets, our
city, our people are just as wonderful to
the eyes of the stranger; there isn't a
commonplace spot in his own town to a
man of appreciation who has not lost the
art of seeing things.
So it is with our lives; they are not
common and never commonplace, save to
him who grows too familiar to see the
' wonder and the glory contained therein.
SA?Q FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1899.
Came to California in IS/2,
Sometimes I go to a carpenter's ship and
see a man skillfully using tool after tool
with a dexterity and intelligence that
seem to me scarcely less than marvelous.
But the poor carpenter toils away day
after day for what he , regards as poor
wages, perhaps discontented, troubled,
weary with his lot. disgusted with life
and longing to fly away from it all. It
is commonplace because it is too familiar.
Go into a great cotton mill and look for
the first time upon a marvelous machine
in operation. But what will the poor
weaver tell you if you ask him what be
thinks about it? The wonder is ail gone,
curiosity all gone, interest n.ll gone; per
haps little save loathing left. And yet,
really in all these spheres what the un
initiated sees is there. It is curious, it
is wonderful, it is interesting to the last
degree; but the one who is living in it
lias prown so familiar with it that his
interest is all pone and he becomes weary
and disheartened.
So in every walk and every work in
life. The housekeeper feels it, the
teacher feels it, the lawyer feels It, the
mechanic feels it, and each one comes to
say at last: "Oh, what a commonplace
life this is I am leading!' Commonplace
because it is familiar, und there is no
longer an appreciative heart to see the
wonder and glory of it all.
Weary as we grow of our common little
lives, they have their value, and I want
to point out a few important facts.
In the first place, we find here the real
tests of character. What was the real
measure and test in the life of General
Grant? It was measured not on the bat
tlefleld, but In his home at Galena, in
communication with his officers around
the camp fire, in the hours when off duty
and off his guard. What was the true
measure of President Lincoln? There
are those who say it IB to be found in
the heroic patience with which he en
dured the four years' struggle in the
"White House. But far more truly was
the measure of the man taken in the
years of preliminary preparation as rail
splitter, surveyor, law student, success
ful lawyer and politician on the frontier
of Illinois.
Many men acquit themselves splendid
ly on public occasions, rise to great
heights of eloquence and power when in
view of other men, who are mean and
petulant and critica* and overbearing and
difficult, to live with in private. It is not
so difficult to be great on great oeca
| slons; the blood is up, courage runs high,
there is inspiration and hope. How much
more difficult it Is to be great amid the
grinding cares and toils of one's common
life from day to day! How hard to be
great when there is no banner, no music,
no applauding multitude â but when, si
lent and lonely, one sees the simple du
ties needing to be done without a word
jof praise or a ray of hope. How many
brilliant women there are. in the face of
other men and women, social stars and
suns, fitted to dazzle and charm and In
terest by their graces of manner or cul
ture of mind, who are absolutely unin
teresting and nearly useless amid the
petty cares and simple duties of life. It
Is so much harder to be great in common
life than to be great on the special oc
casion.
Xo; for the real tests of life you shall
not go to the battlefield, nor the Senate
chamber, nor the ballroom, nor the stock
exchange, nor the legal forum. You
shall go to the home and study the spirit
of the girl In the kitchen who does the
drudgery of the family life, or see the
patient wife and mother, with infinite
care and painstaking doing the simple
things from day to day which need to
be done to hold the homo intact; nr to
the husband returning after his day of
toil in shop or field or office, and watch
his intercourse with wife and child and
servant, or follow him back again on the
morrow and see how ho acquits himself
at his work. Is he brave, is he patient,
is he earnest, is he temperate in this
common little life which he is living from
day to day? The test is there.

ish. and the senor was always very
kind to me. He wrote down my name nnd
the date that we put into port and said
that If ever he got a chance he would let
my parents know what had become of
me. I grew up just like the other Mexi
can boys and I was never lonesome for
Montreal.
"Years afterward, when young Vallejo,
who afterward became General Vallejo,
went to Sonoma he took me with him.
Senor Vallejo, his father, sent him there
to manage the large tracts of land that
the Vallejos owned around what is now
Santa Rosa. At the mission of San Fran
cisco Solano was a padre and I used to
talk Knglish with him. General Vallejo
told him my story and he wrote to the
American Consul at Monterey. Through
thfs Consul my parents heard of me.
"But I did not want to go back to Mon
treal. -I loved my friends, the Vallejos,
Pachecos and the rest of them too much
to leave them.'
"General .Vallejo always treated the
Americans kindly, but they took every
thing away from him a^id from all the
rest of the Mexicans, who had this coun
try long before the Americans came to
ft. When he died I lost my best friend.
I will never forgive the Americans. They
killed him. Not with shot, but they broke
his henrt. All my other friends were
treated the same way. Now they are all
poor: once they had everything.
"Have I got no one to take care of me?
I never married, and my friends are all
Mexicans, and they are dead or too poor
to help m*\ What little they have they
will share with me. but I cannot accept
anything from their small savings. I
never made friends among the gringos.
They did not treat the Mexican right, and
I hate them."
It is like showing the proverbial red rap
to the bull tn mention the gringo to John
Sebastian. Attempt to defend the Ameri
cans and his weak gray eyes light up with
an intense hatred. He immediately re
fuses to talk, and his anger usually
brhifTS on an asthmatic attack.
Addressed !n Spanish, however, he

clear, connected manner, considering his
years. Though he often wandered from
the main thread of his interesting story
he would never say anything of the hap
Most Tariffing Race on Record.
AMONG all the wonders of the last
twenty years, there have been few
things more remarkable than the
development of speed in cycling.
It seems but yesterday that there
were only four men in the world
who could ride a mile on a track under
3 minutes, and that Cortis' feat of com
passing twenty miles within an hour was
a world's wonder. To-day Major Taylor,
the lightning black rider of the States,
can ride a mile in 1 minute. 41 2-5 seconds,
or, with a flying start, in 92 seconds, a
rate of 39 miles an hour; and Elkes, an
other American racer, has covered 34
miles 1220 yards within the hour.
After thirty years of development the
cycle has at last eclipsed in speed every
means of traveling except the locomotive.
It can give the swiftest thoroughbred
that ever flashed round Tattenham Cor
ner a start and a beating in a mile race,
while for shorter distances Persimmon
even would be left panting in the rear.
To illustrate the relative speeds of the
different methods of human progression,
let us in fancy start them all in a mile
handicap. No such thrilling race has
ever been seen on any track, and it would
be worth traveling a thousand miles to
see it.
We must place Major Taylor on his
cycle at scratch. We will take Persim-
Tnon In his marvelous form of Derby day,
1898, when ho covered the course in the

"I kept store on North Fork. I put some
money In a mine, but they cheated me,"
is the way he dismisses that exciting
period in the history of the State. He
has wiped his memory clear of the
"gringo" and his doings.
Bui while the present and the immedl
ate past are dimly Impressed, the memo
ries of those earlier, happier days come
surging thick and fast to crowd out the
Joyless happenings of Inter years,
Sebastian has not forgotten the days
of bountiful hospitality when the Mexi
cans' doors swung wide open for padre,
beggar or senor. - He recounts the days of
feasting and thp bullfights; nights passed
in watching the fascinating fandango and*
softly stnimming on the gu'tar.
At times he forgets that he is on a nar
row cot in a public hospital. With a gay
band of cavaliers he is traveling sixty
miles to attend some wedding where rich,
and poor will feast and mak" m^rry for
a week. The cavalier in those days would
often travel for days if a pair of black
eyes and twinkling feet awaited him at
the .iourney's end.
Then there are moments when John Se
bastian realizes his prosent plight. But
those moments are fortunately few. Ho
t<-lls his story, his age â 98 years, the year
that ho came to Californiaâ lÃl2, in a sim
ple, straightforward manner that does
not admit of dispute.
For he does not say it boastfully. He
docs not wish to be enrolled as the first
and oldest pioneer. Hi 1 will have nothing

While a crowd ot Harvard boys wÂ«rÂ«
celebrating the Pennsylvania game in . he
cafe of a Boston hotel, one of the students
became infatuated with a gorgeous wliite
waistcoat worn by one ot the colored
waiters. He called the man and said to
him. "I want to buy that waistcoat. '
"What you want of that west, boss?"
said the man.
"I just want to buy it. What will you
take for it?"
After a good deal of guffawing and
pome hesitation, the colored man allowed
that he would take five dollars for it.
"Done," said the Harvard man. and he
pulled out a five-dollar bill and gave it to
the negro, who began to pull off the
waistcoat.
"Oh. you needn't do that." said the stu
dent: "I don't want you to give it to me
â I just wanted to feel that I owned that
waistcoat."
Ine negro went to wait on his own ta
ble, whpn the student called to him,
"Come here!"
"What you want, boss?"
The student called the negro up close,
dipped his own fingers into a plate of
cranberry sauce, and with them proceeded
to mark a big "H" on the middle of the

"I hear you have a little sister at your

"Yes, sir," replied Johnny.

I could play marbles with him. an ball,

"Well," said the grocer, "why don t you

of 1127 yards, oc -within 633 yards of the
goal; and the swiftest living walker, to
rival W. Perkins' speed in 1874, when he
covered a mile in 6 minutes 23 seconds,
would require a start of no less than 129*
yards, leaving him little over a quarter
of a mile to cover.
Our handicap for the most exciting rare
of all time stands thus: bicycle scratch;
Persimmon, 20 yards; trotter, 31S yards;
skater, 653 yards; runner. 1054 yards;
racing eight. 1127 yards; and walker, 1294
yards. A race with these handicaps would
furnish the closest finish in sporting an
nals, for all the competitors would break
the tape at exactly the same moment, un
less one or other broke the record and
came in by a neck.
To introduce the locomotive into our
"end of the century" race, we will credit
it with a speed of 60 miles an hour, and
should have to place it 1214 yards behind
scratch.
The speed per hour developed by the dif
ferent Competitors would be: Locomotive,
CO miles: cyclist. 39 miles; thoroughbred, a
shade under 39 miles: trotter. 29: skater
22 1-3: runner, 14 1-5; racing eight, about
1234; and walker, over 9 1-3 miles an hour.
But more marvelous even than the cy
clist's speed is his power of endurance.
To cover a mile in 1 minute 41 2-3 seconds.
and 34 miles 1220 yards in an hour fs by no
means as astounding as to maintain a
rate of 25 2-3 miles an hour for 24 consec
utive hours, as M. CorOang did in his mar
velous days ride at the Crystal Palace in
1897.
The stupendous nature of this feat be
j comes apparent when we consider thai he
could have run sixty-one of the swiftest
horses in England to a standstill, racing
them one after the other for ten m:!t>3
each: probably the most wonderful evi
dence of human endurance and perfect
mechanism ever seen in the worlds his
i tory.
Almost equally remarkable, when we
consider the difficulties of surface, pradi
ent and weather are the long-distance cy â¢
cle records on the roads. Last year F. R.

GOSSIP OF A SOCIETY BUD
DEAREST Marguerite: This has
hcen a red, white and blue week.
"The army and navy forever!" is
now our motto. For shoulder
straps and brass buttons have
cast a golden glow over our little Len
ten pastimes. Were it not for the offi
cers we. girls would simply have to hiber
nate on the memory of former days. For
the men have taken to this reprieve from
social duties like colts on the green pas
tures and we can only watch their antics
from afar â over the fence, as It were.
They have entirely deserted us, just
dropping in for a moment or two on
Sunday afternoons to "keep off the social
blacklist/ Dick says "Lent's not so aw
fully dry, don't cher know:" and then
smacks his lips and looks wise. So
they've evidently found a substitute tor
cotillon punch.
However, we don't mind a bitâ not a
bunch of sour grapes! For with the lowa
in our harhor and the cadets from Y.'est
Point on our shores what more can wÂ«
ask? The officers on the lowa have en
tertained us one and all. Almost every
day there is a luncheon on board to which
a dozen or more girls and chaperones are
invited. Each time it Is a different set,
and every one vites the lowa the
rint-st ship that ever anchored, and its
officers the most gallant hosts that ever
drank to lovely woman. When they go
we shall have to repress our sighs or
there will be a gale at sea.
A great many of the '99 boys from
West Point are with us, waiting for the
first transport to take them to Manila.
They are dear little boys, who are full
of enthusiasm and are not gLven to un
derestimating their own importance. They
blush prettily when addressed by their
titles, and wear their straps with the
same transparent air of nonchalance that
the little girl assumes when she borrows
a long gown and plays "growed up."
They are the dearest youngsters, and
while we have not, perhaps, lost our
hearts to them in the first person, singu
lar number, still we love them collective
ly. A great many ot them who were to
leave on the Valencia called on Friday
evening to say au revoir. They really
were not a bit sorry to go. for they are
so anxious to smell gunpowder that even
parting from us did not cause their tears
to flow.
Ou Tuesday night the officers gave an
informal hop at the : Presidio. The girls
who aro. keeping Lent strictly said "Nay,
nay," but some of us. and I plead guilty,
stifled our little compunctions of conven
tionality, and accepted. We had a per
fectly delightful time and have ali vowed
to go every time they give one, Lenten re
strictions "to the contrary notwithstand
ing. Besides they are such informal little
affairs that surely if the ladies can have
their card parties we can have our hops.
The married ladies have all taken to
cards. Mrs. Jones. Mrs. Smedberg and
Mrs. Timothy Hopkins have all given
card parties at which twenty or more of
our discreet mammas have tried for the
prizes. Mrs. Morgan gave one on Friday
;o eighteen ladies, the materfamilias
among them, and instead of being satiated
with card parties they have declared their
intention of keeping them up ail through

MARRIED AN AGONG GIRL
HONOLULU, Feb. 21.â "Love will find
the way," and so Bessie Afong,
II daughter of the Chinese Croesus of
"Hawaii, and I. R. Burns are mar
ried at last. In spite of parental opposi
tion, a delayed divorce, sisterly expostu
lations and the slow course of true love
running joltlngly, the happy day arrived
when Mr. Burns became a free man, and
there was only parental displeasure left to
cope with.
And Bessie did not cope with it. â¢ She
betook herself to the house of an older
sister, Mrs. J. Alfred Magoon. and with
a younger sister for bridesmaid became,
under a maili bower, Mrs. I. R. Burns.
The Afong family has been for some time
divided against itself. It began when
young Humphries, a lawyer who married
Marie Afong, attempted to interfere in
the management of the Afong affairs.
Mrs. Afong took his advice kindly, but
the majority of the girls rebelled, and
"things were never the same again." So
the girls, who have sided with Bessie in
hsr love affair, did it more to go against
their mother and her adviser, Mr.
Humphries, than for any real sympathy
with Bessie, who was not going to marry
anything but a plain civilian after all, re
gardless of the Afong fondness for bra^s
buttons.
Mrs. Afong has brought up twelve
daughters without, until lately, a suspi
don of "pilikla" â which is Hawaiian for
any form of trouble. When Papa Afong
returned to Chinaâ prompted by the gen- j
erous imnulse of not making himself too
"special" and sticking to any one family,
to the exclusion of anotherâ he left his
Hawaiian wife with two beautiful homes, |
one at the beach, tho other In a fashion
able valley, and ample means to educate |
twelve daughters. And as these daughters !
came out they married in due time, after \
tasting thodelightsof a belleship that was j
undisputed. Each daughter married a
building:.
It is easy to be wise after the event,
but his central idea of facilitating the
ship** progress by rolling over the water
instead of forcing a passage through it
was lust one of those problems which can
be solved only by a full-sized trial, and
the maritime world is Indebted in great
degree to M. Ernest Bazin for definitely
setting at rest for all time the feasibility
of attaining any notable- improvement in
speed or stability by the adoption of the
roller principle. The six hollow rollers
served, here an artistic confusion Is not
only permitted but really imperative. As
hangings and coverings only small fig
ured, light, dainty silks .must be used;
never woolen or brocade materials. Only
the airiest furniture must be adopted,
heavy pieces being entirely out of place.
One corner, of course, is to be occupied
by a comfortable couch, heaped with pil
lows, draped with antique shawls or. cost
ly furs, or with cheap denim, as the purse
allows. Near by a dainty little working
table or an enameled basket for the sa.me
purpose looks well. Everywhere should be
pretty trifles, softly shaded lamps, ex
quisite little cups. No particular style
need be adopted, but let fancy dictate the
rest. The only inflexible rule for the bou
doir Is that it shall strictly harmo'nlze
with her who is its queen. Her little king
dom will then be one more success if she
appears In it more charming to those who
love her, and If In their eyes she reads
their admiration when she admits them
into it.
There is only one town In which the

their spacious mansion and luxurious sur

And Mamma Afong smiled and was
content. Her Chinese husband had been
hard working, shrewd, successful and
generousâ far beyond any Hawaiian hus
band on recordâ and her girls were mak
ing satisfactory matches. Eighteen grand
children clustered about Mamma Afong"s
knee, and Mrs. Afong, well preserved,
good-looking and prosperous, looked upon
her white sons-in-law and thought, "All
Is well."
But there is always a fly In the mo

was rumored, an Afong. Mrs. Afong 1 at

HELEN GOULD`S TROUBLES
HELEN GOULD suggests In no way
the owner of millions. She goes
about her sitting room, which is
the second story front of the old
house at 575 Fifth avenue,
dressed in a sort of gown which a maid
or a country seamstress might have
made, her hair brushed soberly away
from her face, and sometimes even an old
fashioned white apron to protect her
dress.
There are thousands of girls In New
York whoso fathers wonder where the
money to buy their clothes and matinee
tickets is to come from who lead a more
elegant existence than this simple young
woman.
Mlps Gould has all the old fashioned
habits of thought as well as the old fash
ioned virtues. Four years ago she made
a confidence to an intimate friend.
"There are," she said, "three things
that I want to do. I want to bring up
Frank to be a fine man, as good a man
as my father was, for I believe he was
the best man who ever lived. I want to
make the world understand how fine and
tender a man my father was; and I want
to make the name of Gould as loved In
New York as that of Burdett-Coutts in
London."
Frank Gould has just attained his ma
jority, and he bids fair to carry out his
sister's plans for htm. He is clear-head
ed, good-looking, grave and tender toward
his Bister, and he gives her the worship
for her devotion which she deserves.
The late Jay Gould had many enemies
in his lifetime, and the vision of some
of them may have been blinded.
During the late trial of the blackmail
or who tried to prove that Jay Gould
had been a bigamist his reputation was
more or less gone over by the press. One

The method of propulsion is the usual

\iting him into her parlor, as was com
patible with her well known hospitality,
she took another stand and declared that
she thought him "fly."
So Bessie met him outside, which, al
though not an original mode of procedure,
was satisfactory enough. They bicycled
together daily and spent many hours in
each other's society, while the sisters tooW
sides and Mrs. Afong refused to accept
congratulations. In the meantime Mrs.
Afong was told that her would-be son-in
law had stated, on leaving San Francisco,
"I am going to Honolulu to marry an
Afong; any one of them will do; all
Afongs look alike to me."
This was not soothing. Mrs. Afong bÂ«
lleved it, but Bessie did not, and so sh<i
and her fiance waited for the divorce, and
they came to realize that the law is slow.
In all this time Mr. Burns was never
admitted into the Afong home. And the,
majority of Mrs.' Afong's sons-in-law
stood In with her. But the Magoons cama
to the rescue and had the wedding, and
.now Mr. and Mrs. Burns are residing in
a neat little cottage on Emma street, two
or three miles away from the Afong
home, and they don't speak to Mamma
Afong as they pass by. Still it is thought
that a reconciliation will take place, for
although each of the girls has $10,000 of
her own, Mrs. Afong has more.

The Power of a Cyclone.
Careful estimates of the force of a

a full fledged hurricane in active operation,

makes the mightiest efforts of man ap

fully equal to four hundred and seventy

as developed in a West Indian cyclone.
This is about fifteen times the power that

In which she had just read the statement
that if Jay Gould was not a bigamist ha
had taken the money of widows and or
phans.
"And what." I should like to know,
Miss Gould said scornfully to her private
secretary, "are widows and orphans spec
ulating in Wall street for? I knew my
father as no other human being on earth
knew him. I know he never heard of a
rase of sorrow or distress which he did
not try to relieve."
The final Idea of Helen Gould to be a
second Baroness Burdett-Coutts has been
discovered by persons who live by their
wits. As a consequence she Is besieged
mi every hand by people with schemes,
philanthropic and personal, as well as by
frank beggars. They write to her for all
sorts of things. One day she is invited
to appear at a church fair to be exhibit

wants her to help a church out of debt
or pay for the education of a young gir\
who has "a fortune in her voice."
Then there are the schemes. They
range from dally newspapers and theat

young ladies and patent incubators. On

Although the wearing of mourning has
been the subject of much argument, the
majority still persist in wearing black as
the emblem of mourning. Mourning can
be the most becoming or the most un
becoming style of dress a woman can
wear, and it requires considerable time
and thought to choose wisely in this par
ticular line of goods. In no other class
of goods has there been such an improve
ment as in the mourning goods. Rusty
black is rarely seen now, even in the
cheaper materials, while in the expensive
qualities all the fabrics have an exquisite
black shade that is neither blue-black nor
gray black, but simply black, and this
means a great deal.
Henrietta and Eudora cloths are, as a
rule used for the first mourning gowns.
Ku'lora is very much like Henrietta, but
it is heavier and a little different in the
weave. These materials are very soft in
finish drape well and are especially suit
ed to the styles of the present day, which
are soft and clinging.
Among the new materials shown in the
mourning goods is the cravenette or
waterproof serge and cheviot. These new
cloths are said to be. and apparently are,
absolutely waterproof and at the same
time possess none of the disagreeable
qualities of the usual waterproof mate
rials. The manufacturers say that the
material is rendered waterproof by a cas
ing of glass around some of the threads.
Gown With Dotted Chemisette.
The dotted chemisette In this gown
gives It a quaint yet fashionable ef
fect. The shoulder capes are of the
same material as the bodice and
show several rows of tuckings in
the sleeves. The collar is odd and
is finished in front with a bow of
soft material harmonizing with the
applique bow knot on the bodice.
A ribbon belt and gored skirt com
plete this pretty costume.
These costumes, like the Eudora and
Henrietta cloths, should not be trimmed
with crape, but with. the material of the
gown. For street gowns to be put into
hard service there are a great many
serges, cheviots and plain wool materials
that make up well and look very smart.
Kntire gowns of crape are most becom
ing and fashionable. They are made up
in house gowns, dinner gowns and street
gowns. A gown of crape made with a
coat and skirt is very smart. Broad
bands of crape on a gown look better
than small folds. Small folds also collect
the dust quickly and somehow lack the
style of the broad bands.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Dinner gowns and house gowns of
mourning silk are among the novelties
this year. The silk is dull in effect, ab
solutely lusterless; the jet, too, with
which the waist is trimmed is also lus
terless. There is never any white used
on these gowns: that would quite spoil
the effect. The dull black evening gowns,
or the black satin evening gowns, with
folds of white tulle just against the neck,
and tulle or net sleeves, are among the
new things shown for mourning wear.
The out of door costumes, trimmed with
white tulle around the neck and sleeves,
are very dainty. The sheer white collars
and cuffs are more and more used on
widows' costumes each season. They re
lieve the dead black astonishingly, and
at the same time seem to heighten
mourning, if such a thing is possible.
Widows wear, too, a little white ruching
inside their bonnets.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Apropos of mousseline or chiffon pllsse
many women have an Idea that once the
plaiting becomes rumpled or limp the
flounces or trimmings are to be discarded
as useless. Not soâ after ripping them
from the garment, they should be ironed
out and taken to the plaiter, where they
will be restored r-qu.il to new.
â¢ â¢ â¢
This new pampas cloth Is one of the
successes of the season. It Is soft, lus
trous and so fit to make up into tunics
and princesse models. Applied designs in
white suggest an effective trimming.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Among newly made cotton gowns skirts
I are seen where the front gore is split Its
length and then laced together with a
contrasting cord. An Eton waist has its
fronts laced together also below the high
revers. On certain pretty sheer afternoon
lawns these lacings might be introduced
as a novelty, but. Instead of cord, nar
row ribbons or velvets would prove more
effective. Plain sheer lawns in buff, pink
and blue made over white would show
these lacings off so prettily. A single lac-
Ing down the front of skirt is not very
| pleasing. Introduced on the sides, or
j forming pyramids around the bottom of a
skirt, they are very much 'prettier. But
these lacings on skirts should have a tack
or stitch here and there to keep them In
place and prevent the ribbons from catch-
Ing on projections in walking about.
â¢ â¢ â¢
We may soon look for a change of line
in corsets. The latest Paris model, not yet
adopted on this side, is straighter down
the front than the present models, giving
greater freedom to the muscles of the
stomach. This French corset Is very
deeply set over the hips when made for
stout figures. Slender waist measure
ments are still In vogue, but there is a
marked increase in the amplitude of the
bust, which will be sure to be the spring
gown's new bodice feature.
As Paris lingeries always set the fash
lons in everything comprised under the
term underwear, the most prominent
makers of Rue de la Paix declare for
Snint Simplicity. They frown down all
past complications in chemises and night
dresses, and no longer will tolerate over
frillings or empiecements. Both materials
and laces cannot be too fine or too ex
quisite, but they must simply be intro
duced. Among the varieties of lace Val
enciennes is preferred, but fine guipure
may be used on nightgowns.

PARIS, Feb. 25.â Chatting over a cup
of tea at Miss Davies' tea parlors,
in the Boulevard Hausmann, yes
terday, I gleaned the opinions of the
proprietress on the subject of mak
ing tea.
"China tea takes quite four minutes to
infuse, but Ceylon tea, as a matter of ex
perience, infuses more quickly. China
tea has a coarser taste, and you might,
under similar circumstances, think it
stronger, but in reality it is not. At one
time I had three varieties of China tea.

Many people liked it, finding that strong,
smoky taste â not a perfumed taste â to
their liking. But lam perfectly certain
that Ceylon tea is better and more popu
lar and can be made stronger than any
other kind if you put in the proper
amount, though for ordinary tastes you
would not have to put in so much to get
a moderately strong cup of tea.
"In regard to earthenware pots, one can
follow with safety the advice of 'O.
Shaw,' and use two in order to have a
perfect cup of tea. It is true that in do-
Ing so It takes longer. People who come
to a tearoom won't wait for all this prep
aration, for it is like making tea twice
over. Still, if you have time to make
tea at home, I should recommend that
the teapot should be heated beforehand,
until it is dryâ an earthenware teapot by
preference â heating the teapot over the
boiler if you can; then put the tea in and
pour freshly boiled water on it. Then

ci -i WOMAN with stooped shoul-
TTvT den cannot be a beauty, no
fl j\ matter how fair her skin, or
I U how regular her features. I
ii \> really know of nothing more dis-
tressing than to see a young
and pretty girl with round and stooping
shoulders who goes through life looking
for possible pins on the ground. This la
one beauty ill that is wholly unnecessary
and of which any woman can positively
cure herself, without any outside help.
All that she needs Is a little energy and
will power, together with plenty of per
severance. Although most of us know
remedies for our small failings few of us
â more's the pityâ apply them persistently
until a cure is brought about.
When starting in to reform round shoul
ders the first thing to remember is that
the chest must be held outward and up
ward. In doing this, It is not necessary
to force the shoulders back to such an
extent as to make little crowsfeet in the
back of your gown. There are several
benefits to be derived from holding the
chest in this manner. If practiced con
tinually, it will strengthen the lungs, and
will aleo develop the neck and chest as
nothing else will.
The breathing exercises that I wrote
about several months ago will also help.
These are best taken in the morning, in a
loose gown, and with the windows open.
Inhale slowly and smoothly as much air
as you can. Hold for a few seconds and
then exhale It slowly and gradually. Con
tinue this for five minutes, walking slowly
across the room while going through the
exercise. If continued for a year the
breathing exercises will develop the chest
an inch or two.
Incorrect positions during deep are re
sponsible for many stooped shoulders.
You should sleep on a hard mattress and
should be careful that the pillow is not
too high, as this throws the head forward
and increases the roundness of the shoul
ders. It is best to sleep on no pillow at all,
and after one has become accustomed to
sleeping that way it will be found alto
f ether comfortable and much more rest
ul. Instead of lying curled up like
shrimps, as most women do, lie face
downward, with the arms straight at the
sides.
The custom, common to many women,
of pinning the hose supporters to the
front of the corset has by constant pull
ing of the elastic a tendency to make
BhoulderÃ droop In a most disconsolate
way.
Shoes with high heels and narrow toes
are equally bad.
There is nothing like a tailor-made
gown to make a woman stand straight,
for unless she keeps her shoulders back
the front of the bodice will fall into the
most distressing wrinkles and utterly
spoil the "melted-and-poured-in" effect
that women 6O dote on. I
whether it is Ceylon or China tea) will
suffice, when you should pour the tea off
into another dry, hot teapot. The tea
thus made can stand as long as you like,
and is always good. In this respect tea
is superior to coffee, because the latter
loses its flavor after standing, whereas
tea does not.
"Now, few people understand making
iced tea, which is so agreeable in the
summer.
"Very many think iced tea means only
tea ordinarily made and then iced. This
Is all wrong. It should be made with
cold water. Put a generous amount of
tea in a jug, pour cold water on the tea,
then let it stand for several hours. I
prefer letting It stand over night. Next
pour the tea off into another jug and
place it in a refrigerator.
"Do you approve of using cosies?"
"No. Tea cosies take us back to many
years ago, when old fashioned housewives
imagined that ten minutes' infusion was
necessary. Nowadays this method is not
followed."
"Should the milk be poured into the cup
before or after the tea?"
"Well, I think it should be poured into
the cup before the tea, and you will find
that the tea has a better and smoother
flavor. On the other hand, if you pou*
the milk In afterward one can measure
more easily the exact quantity of milk
required.
"Coming back to the subject of using
two teapots, I am sure that it would not
be practicable in a tearoom. People
would not believe it was properly made
if they did not see the tea leaves in the
pot. Why. they would think it was made
in one of those large 'tea boilers' which
are used in England for 'school treats.' "
Sir Henry Hawkins was once presiding
over a long, tedious and uninteresting
trial, and was listening, apparently with
great attention, to a very ions-winded
speech from a learned counsel. After
awhile he made a pencil memorandum,
folded it and sent it by the usher to the
By Mme. Hygeia.
Other things to be remembered are:
Always stand on the front or ball of the
foot and keep the knoes straight. Carry
yourself so that a plumb line dropped
from tho tip of your nose would fall just
an inch in front of your great toe. Don't
put your head forward and be in such
a hurry that you will waddle along like
a little duckling with absolutely -no grace
or carriage. Have your clothing com
fortable and loose enough to give your
lungs opportunity for the full expansion
that, for the sake of your health, they
should have. Do not stoop over your
work or reading, and always sit in a
chair with a straight back to lean
against.
If these rules are followed religiously
the worst case of round shoulders may
be cured, unless they are caused by a
weakness of constitution or health. In
that case. In addition to the rules, a good
strong tonic should be taken, lots of sleep
and plenty of outdoor exercise.
Remember now you can't be pretty, un
lessuyou hold the shoulders back, the chin
well in the air, the bust out and the
stomach in. The old Sunday school ad
monition, "Look up and not down; look
out and not In." Is an excellent one to
bear in mind when starting in to correct
round shoulders.

CECIL T. M.â As you have such a
"very, very clear" complexion, my ad

"Making up," as you express It, is a sort

are best obtained by perfect health.
Rouge is vulgar and common, there is
no doubt about that. However, if -ou
think otherwise and fancy that you have
apt enough to apply it so it will not show,
then merely add a little carmine to
your home-made cold cream. That is the
purest rouge that can be gdt. As I do
not know the color of your hair or the
tint desired, I cannot very well tell you
what to use on it.
EAST OAKLANDâ I have never ad
vised the use of ammonia by itself for
superfluous hair. In combination with
peroxide of hydrogen it will bleach and
finally deaden the little hairs. A tea
spooriful of ammonia to six teaspoonfuls
of the peroxide is the proper proportion.
Dabble the superfluous nairs with this as
often as you think necessary. It will take
time and patience, for the bleach will not
take effect immediately. If you care to
try the electric needle again and will send
me a stamped addressed envelope, I will
send you the address of some one who is
very skillful with the little needle am
whose terms are quite reasonable. A very
slight quantity of ammonia is put in tne

AN appalling tragedy occurred the
other day on the steamer Orion, as
the vessel was making her way
from Santos in Brazil to Genoa.
Among the passengers was a fam
ily named Forrarini, the members
of which were natives of Modena. The
family comprised the father, mother and
four children, who were returning to Italy
with a snug little fortune which the lather
had accumulated in Brazil.
During the voyage Mr. and Mrs. For
rarini frequently quarreled, the husband
accusing the wife of improper conduct,
and she retorting that he was insane
through unfounded jealousy. Finally in
presence of all the passengers the hus
band made an awful charge in regard to
the two youngest children, winding up his
invective by saying that he would not
acknowledge them. At this the wife be-
came beside herself with indignation, and,
catching the two little ones in her arms,
she sprang to the side of the vessel and
flung herself overboard.
The witnesses of this horrible act were
for the moment petrified with amazement.
Then the captain was notified, the vessel
Was stopped and boats were hastily
launched In the hope of saving the three
unfortunates. This hope, however, was
soon seen to be baseless. The sturdy sea
men did their best, but the sea had en
gulfed its prey, and the bodies could not
be recovered.
When Forrarinl saw that tne search
was useless he abandoned himself to de
spair, and It soon became evident that
he was losing entire command of himself.
Consequently a close watch was kept over
hi.-; movements, but he eluded his watch
ers, and on the third day after his wife
had drowned herself and the two young
est children he, too, flung himself over
board and met with the same death.
There were now only two children left,
and when the vessel arrived at Genoa
they were handed over to the care of the
authorities.
a nightly scrubbing with a complexion
brush, tepid water and pure castile soap,
followed by a smearing with a good cold
cream. The following can be depended
on: Spermaceti, 1% ounces; pure white
wax, if, ounce; oil of sweet almonds, IVi
ounces; rosewater, % ounce. Do you take
a daily sponge bath and lots of exercise
in the open air? Both are necessary in
the acquirement of a fine skin.
JENNIE L.â Massage the bust gently
for ten or fifteen minutes each night with
equal parts of cocoa butter, lanoline and
cocoanut oil melted together, rubbing
around and around with the palm of the
hand. Then in the morning bathe the
breasts with tepid water, rubbing brisk
ly with a Turkish towel. Last unday's
Beauty Talk contained a number of sug
gestions that will he of benefit In treat
ing that troublesome nose. I should ad
vise frequent applications of witch hazel.
L. L. C. S.â The following astringent
wash Is excellent for coarse pores: Take
a half-pint bottle and place in it three
tablespoonfuls of fresh, uncooked cucum
ber juice. Half fill the bottle with elder
flower water and then add two table
spoonfuls of eau de cologne. Shake well
and add very slowly half an ounce of
simple tincture of benzoin, shaking the
mixture now and then. Fill the bottle
with elder flower water. Use two or three
times a day, letting it dry on the skin.
Also use the face scrubbing brush every
night with tepid water and castile soap.
R. A. P.â For the falling eyebrows ap
ply a tonic made of five grains of quinine
dissolved in one ounce of alcohol. Dear,
dear! Here is the same old plaint again â
hair that Is turning gray. What if your
hair is turning gray? I think it's lovely.
But then opinions differ so. If you must
have the darker shades back, then take
an iron tonic and rub claret into the
Bcalp. Or you might try this hair-darken
ing agent, which may be of help: Sul
phate of iron, crushed, one dram; rectified
spirits, one fluid ounce; oil of rosemary,
ten drops; pure distilled water one-half
pint. Ir you cannot get red vaseline the
ordinary yellow kind will answer the pur-
pose.
HELEN Câ You can have no Idea what
a pleasure It is to me to receive a sin
cere little letter like yours. The appre
ciation expressed is quite sufficient re
turn, I assure you, for any service I may
have been to you and your friends. Let
mÂ«Â» see â you asked about the hair, didn't
you? In the Sunday Call of February 12
there was a special Beauty Talk about
the hair. I feel certain you must have
found in it something that just fitted your
case. If not, write to me again and I will
try and suggest something else. In the
foregoing reply to Jennie L. you will find
formula for the cream and a4so directions
far Its use. The alum wash is to be used
only in case of nabbiness of the skin. |
"Write to me again. Do net fear that I
shall vote you a nuisance, no matter how
often you write.
AILEENâ You will find a portion of the
information you ask in foregoing reply to
Jennie L. Calisthenics and swinging In
dian clubs will also help, particularly In
developing the arms. Did you see the
Beauty Talk of February 12? It an
swered your question about the hair.
BABY E.â Am sorry you have had to
wait so long for your answer. My corre
spondents all clamor for immediate re
plies, but I have to treat them all alike
and take each one in turn. If you find
the skin food too oily for your skin, why
not try a cream that contains less oil?
Formula is given In reply to East Oak
land for ore that I think will be just the
thing lor your skin. A few grains of bo
rax will improve It if your skin is very
oily. The following cosmetic jelly you
wiil find particularly nice to rub on the
skin before applying powder: Gum tra
gacanth, whole, 30 grains; rosewater, 7
ounces; glycerine, half ounce; alcohol,
half ounce. Soften the tragacanth in the
rosewater for a day or two ana then
strain forcibly through muslin or cheese
cloth. Then add the glycerine and rose
water previously mixed, shake well and
perfume to suit.
A READERâ PIease try the following
skin food on your face. I am sure it will
help It: Spermaceti, half ounce; white
wax, half ounce: sweet almond oil, 1
ounce; lanollne, 1 ounce; cocoanut oil. 1
ounce; tincture of benzoin, 10 drops; or
ange flower water. 1 ounce. Melt the first
five ingredients in a porcelain kettle.
Take from the fire and add the benzoin
and orange flower water, beating with an
egg beater until cold and smooth. I do
not care for liquid face powder, although
the one you mention is as good as any
made. Why do you not try the formula
given to L. A. B. in Sunday Call of Feb
ruary 19? It will not roughen your skin,
I am sure. Never wash your face just
before going out, or immediately after
coming in. A good plan is to smear the
face with cold cream after exposure to
wind or sun, rubbing it off in a few min
utes with a soft cloth.
LAISEâ I am positive that I have never
spoken of any such thing as "mutton
cream" for the eyelashes or any other
purpose. What I usually recommend for
the eyelashes is a mixture of equal parts
of vaseline and cocoanut oil. You must
be careful in using It, not to got it in the
eyes.' A little alcohol in water will not
injure the skin, but pure alcohol, used
frequently, is altogether too harsh and
drying. Glycerine does not agree with all
skins. If you find that it suits yours then
a few drops of it in rosewater can be
used with safety. I cannot say that I
approve of your manner of taking a
sponge bath. I think it is much better to
dry oneself thoroughly before getting into
bed. The temperature of the water in
which one bathes should be governed en
tirely by the individual. If one is robust
enough to stand a sponging off in cold
water it is most invigorating, but for a
person of delicate physique it would be
very unwise. So I usually recommend the
tepid sponge as most likely to agree with
every one.

make it yourself, whichever you prefer. !
Why not "try it yourselfâ it's lots of fun;

T-ilk you will have found all the infor
mation you desired on treatment of pim
ples When you have gotten rid of the ;

Ordinary washing of the face will not |
rid it of this latter affliction. You must ,

Is necessary to ward off any irritation
that may come. After the first thorough
cleansing of the pores, the water soap
brush and cream will be sufficient. The
alcohol is to be used only as the_ I first
means of clearing the skin of the black
beads. Too much alcohol is very bad for
one's complexion. Do not press the
blackheads out unless they are very large
and stubborn.
I TESSIE D.â The simplest way of re
moving freckles is to dissolve fifteen
grains of borax in one ounce of lemon
iutce and apply to the face every night
"with a small soft brush. This will re
move the freckles, but it will not pre
! vent them from returning. Nothing will
! do that but to protect the face from ex- i
! posure to the sun.
i A BEAVTY LOVERâ In purchasing
! peroxide of hydrogen get a bottle that has ;
! never been opened and after taking out
| the quantity you wish to use the bottle
! must be tightly corked and kept in a
dark place when not in use. Possibly that
which you got was not quite fresh, or
perhaps you did not use it often enough.
Massage with olive oil Is the only thing
I can suggest for the knees.
K. X.â The sage tea is the very thing
I would advise for your hair. I don't care
for the wash you have been using. It is
very drying to the skin and is apt to make
lit harsh and scaly. Neither do I approve
of washing the face in hot water. In time
it will make it coarse, leathery and liable
to chap. Use tepid water always. If your
skin is very sallow you will find the fol
lowing wash of benefit: One-quarter

quarter pint each of fresh lemon juice
and brandy. Let simmer slowly for three
hours Press, strain and decant. Apply

delightful toilet soap Is made by taking.
White castile soap, 8 ounces; honey.
1 ounce- spermaceti, 1 ounce; oil of sweet

double boiler and when hot add the soap.
In another double boiler put the oU of
almonds and the spermaceti and the wax
which have been grated fine. W hen the
soap Is entirely melted pour the oils and
the soap together. Sometimes it may
be necessary to add a little hot water to
the honey and soap, but be very sparing
of it lest you weaken your soap so that
it will not harden. Two tablespoonfuls
at most is quite enough. After the oils

THE REBEKAHS.
On Saturday, February 24, California
Rebekah Lodge gave a party in its hall,
â¢which turned out to be one of those pleas
ant affairs that are periodically given
under the auspices of this energetic body.
Waihalla Rebekah Lodge (German) cele
brated its eleventh anniversary February 24
by a pleasant social evening in its lodge
room in the Odd Fellows' building. There
was a good attendance of members and
friends and there was enjoyment for all
until a late hour.
The members of Mission Rebekah Lodge
and their many friends assembled in
large numbers in the lodgeroom on Mis
sion street to take part in a sheet and
pillow-case party got up under the direc
tion of the entertainment committee of
the ledge. As that committee knows how
to arrange an evening's fun, it is almost
needless to assert that there was a great
deal of amusement for all participants.
Last Wednesday Oriental Rebekah
Lodge had ten candidates to initiate, and
as It had been announced that there
would be presented some new features In
the floor work there was a large attend
ance of members of the order, many from
other lodges anxious to secure points.
The work wae done to perfection and was
highly complimented by those who are
competent to judge. After the ceremony
and the close of busim-Â«s there was a
pleasant social hour.
The Assembly of California will meet
in this city on the 9th of May.

position, and it is not intended herein to
deal with those personalities of his life
In which the public has no moral or legitl-
mate Interest. Enough that this slight
series of appreciations should deal with
such facts nf public interest as may be
properly accredited, and such report as
may have a possible bearing upon the
work of the head and hand of thin strong
man. From 1892 to 1896 Mr. Kipling lived
chiefly in the I T nited States, building him
self a home among the Green Mountains
at Brattleboro, Vt.. residing there until
he returned to England. In 1898 he sailed
for Cape Town, South Africa, accom
panied by his family, returning during the
autumn, and taking up his abode at Rot
tingdean, on the south coast of England.
His next journey was to America in Jan
uary, 1899, en route, it was said, to Mexico.
Mr. Kipling, it is thus seen, has been a
great traveler, and it is by this means
possibly that the full vigor of a naturally
strong and virile brain gives out only its
best. We have in Mr. Kipling, as evinced
by his works, a true exemplification of
the virtue of turning occasionally to
"fresh fields and pastures new" for one's
inspiration, a circumstance which is self
evident when one recounts the variety
and scope of his recent work.

Fred H. Jung, recording secretary of

received a letter from Captain George
Filmer, commanding Company B, First
California. Volunteers, at Manila in ac
knowledgment of good things pent to him
and other members of the parlor who are
in the volunteer service. The captain
writes as follows:
Your kind letter on behalf of the brothers of
Stanford Parlor, also box containing
my "share of the spoils, " as you
were pleased to call it, arrived O.
X., ami I assure you and all the
brothers of Stanford Parlor that I thoroughly
enjoyed all the good and useful things con
tained In the trox of goodieÃ. It is impossible
to explain how I felt some 8000 miles away
at receiving such an appropriate gift from dear
old 'Frisco. Only the poor fellows who did
not receive any Christmas present can explain
what the feelings must be at not receiving
one. It is needless to say that I will never
forget the kindness, and hope to be in a
position some time when I will be able to par
tially chow my appreciation. Stanford Parlor
has always been dear to me. I have always
been proud to say that I am a member of
Stanford Parlor. We look forward to return-
Ing home some time in the near future. I
hope to be able soon to express to you per
sonally what I cannot find words to write.
Kind regards to all the brothers and best
wishes for the future of Stanford Parlor.

the Indian newspaper for the value of a

to account; His travels led him to Eng

he published through, various newspapers

J-lis Recent Illness.
The feeling people here have shown i
since Mr. Kipling fell ill has moved some !
friendÃ who have seen a great deal of ]
him during this visit to talk interesting
ly about him. They wish to clear away
an old misunderstanding. It seems that !
nothing has ever distressed Mr. Kipling
more- than the general impression prevail
ing here and in England that he dislikes :
the American people. It is utterly un
true.
His chief object in coming to America
this time, his friends say, was to efface
that false Impression. He was willing to I
do anything he could to show his real
feelings for the fellow-countrymen of his !
wife, to show that he was not the
"bloomin" bludgeon" they took him for.
The man is bored by formal going out,
yet he offered to dress every night of his
visit to meet any and all people whom he
could make his friends.
When Mr. Kipling was a young man he
made a journey from India to England
by way of the United States. He had'
one or two of his books published and he
was an extraordinarily "clever young
man," with a power over words that ho
was accustom< >1 to let out freely. The
running glimpse of American life afford
ed the young genius an opportunity
which he "must have been a dozen years
older to have neglected. He wrote' a vol
ume of amazing notes, which the mass
of readersâ who are by no means amaz
ing in their, literary understandingâswal
lowed seriously, and they proved a lump
ish mouthful. Now Mr. Kipling's sin pur
sues him. He makes this hard-headed
misconception of his nal position and
sympathy. He is hard put it to it to show
himself through the veil of prejudice.
Kipling's Ambition.
People who are impatient for greater
work from the man who reached almost
at a leap an extraordinary level, and who,
they say, has done no more in a half
dozen years than maintain that level, will
be interested in this opinion of his own.
Mr. Kipling says that no man can write
a nal novel until he is 40. Up to that
time the artist must be willing 1 to do lessor
thincs. practice smaller efforts, pay more
attention to detail than It apparently de
serves and wait, for the power of the mas
ter. By and by that will come; the artist
will write a novel that is big with the
larger facts of life, handled in a larger
way.
When Mr. Kipling does write his great
novel it will be something elemental
snmetninq- almost primeval. "Without
Benefit of Clergy" may furnish the thenv
and for setting and characters the new
novel will almost surely contain, "writ
large," the Kngllshman and ' Indian
woman, and their storyâ all of It.

NATIONAL UNION.
On the night of the 24th inst. the San'
Francisco Cabinet held a meeting at'
which there was a good attendance of '
representatives from the seven local coun-<
ells, also several invited members of the<
order. President Arter presided. The
principal business was the discussion of'
proposition to give an entertainment in'
celebration of the eighteenth anniversary
of the order in May. The opinion of cv-<
cry member was taken, and it was de
cided that there should be an entertain
ment something on the lines of the one 4
given last year, and to excel it if possi-<
ble. It was decided that there should
not be a ball to follow the programme to
be offered. It will be given under the<
â¢auspices of the cabinet. â¢ ' j
Last Friday night the members of the
cabinet paid an official visit to El Do-
rado Council in the Alcazar building, and<
there the team of the cabinet initiated j
candidates for the sitting council, in the'
full form of the three degrees. The at-<S
tendance was a good one, and in addition
to the membership of the council and of
the cabinet, there were present quite a
number of members of the order. Ad
dresses were made by President Arter of
the cabinet, Senator Field, Secretary
Hastings of the cabinet, and a number of
others.
Last Tuesday evening there was a good
attendance of members at Golden Gate
Council, and a very pleasant evening was

SONS OF EXEMPTS.
At the last held meeting of the Sons
of Exempts, in the hall of the Exempts
on Brenham place, there was presented
the names of a number of sons of old
time firemen who are eligible to member
ship, and a committee was appointed to
call upon them with a view of having
them become members of the organiza
tion that is to perpetuate the Exempt
Company of San Francisco Firemen of the
Volunteer Department. At an informal
meeting recently held It was announced
that when the old Exempt Company was
reduced to a very small number all the
property and archives now in its posses
sion would pass in to the care and cus
tody of the Juniors to preserve for all
time to come. The new association is
doing well, considering the short time
that has been organized, and w-nen Its
objects become thoroughly understood
there is no doubt that eligiblesâ who must
be sons of volunteer firemen, who them
selves were eligible to admission Into the
ranks of the Exemptsâ wJll swell the
ranks and in a short time make it one
of the powerful social organizations of

THE CHOSEN FRIENDS.
Social Council No. 46 gave one of tha
most entertaining "evenings at home
last Tuesday night that It has ever given
one that was a success in the sense or
being a drawing card and excellence of
programme. The event was in the ban
quet hall of the Native Bons' building, and
the attendance exceeded 300. The commit
tee of arrangements, consisting of W. P.
Gibson, chairman and master of ceremo
nies, Mesdames Gibson, Baccua, Voy and
Adams and Miss Clara McDonald, pre
sented a varied programme, which nad
for features: Scarf dance. Miss Lois
Underwood; vocal solo, W. Ratigan; reci
tation, Mary E. Hart, vice president of
the Pacific Coast Women's Press Associa
tion; address, by F. D. Brandon; cornet
duet. Misses Josie and May Gitchell. and
vocal solo, by Miss Maude Still, whose ef
forts were unusually good. So pleasing
were her efforts that she was encored
three times. The programme was followed
by dancing, under the direction of J. S.
Carr. floor manager, and F. Uphaus, G.
W. Smith and W. M. Sullivan, assistants.
The Progressive Councils, represented
by a committee of three from each of tha
local councils, met in the hall of Fair
mount Council last Monday night and
adopted plans for the entertainment or
the delegates to the Grand Council.
Garden City Council at its last held
meeting had three initiations, received ap
plications and wound up with a chicken
tamale supper. The council is arranging
for the celebration of the anniversary of
the order.
Grand Councilor Boehm has appointed a
committee from each of the local councils
to meet next Friday in the hall of Golden
Gate Council to arrange for a celebration
of the anniversary of the order on thi
29th. of May.THE week has not been notable for
novelties; In fact there was little
or nothing new at any of the
show houses; but it gave us a
few hours of pause In which to
make ready for the opera season and
realize generally how the theatrical
prospects of San Francisco have loomed
up in as much of the season as has al
ready been accomplished. A year ago
San Francisco was enduring a theatri
cal famine. There was money in the
town and there were playgoers willing
t" spend it; but the attractions were
almopt uniformly frivolous, vulgar and
cheap, and the regular old-time patron
of the drama found it to his advantage
to stay home o' nights. For many
months he persisted in staying home;
and even when Bane productions were
again in order, it took him a long time
to exchange his fireside and book and
Flippers for the pleasures of the theater.
But now it would seem that he is com
pletely won back to his old love. The
managers of the higher-priced theaters
have found uninterrupted prosperity in
the new year. And at the same time
the managers of the lesser houses of
amusement have lost nothing; they
have continued business with pleasure
to their patrons and profit to them
selves. To be sure the Baldwin is
burned and old Morosco'a is no more.
But the destruction of the Baldwin
merely forced attractions and audiences
t" the California, which before that
time had been anything but a prosper
ous house; and the closing down of
meant the rev.val of the
i ; rand Opera House and the prospect
of another and hiei^r theatrical piunge
un th>- part of Mr. Morosco. The
Orpheum has continued the most popu
lar and financially fortunate theater in
San Francisoo by giving its following
th-> best possible vaudeville show for
an incredibly cheap admission. The
comic opeia and other productions at
the Tivoli have succeeded on similar
lines. The Alcazar, which has always
; <:-r.tÂ« rprise in securing
the rights to fairly new plays, has held
its own faithful clientele and gained
many new friends in the way of former
Morosco patrons. Even the Comedy
Theater, with its several disastrous
productions, has managed to keep the
lights lighted and the doors open. It
has endured beyond the most sanguine
tations <>f experts and now seems
to occupy a permanent place in local
theatricals. And this week the Alham
i>ra will be opened as a regular temple
of melodrama. Include the Chutes,
which is really a formidable enterprise,
and count on th<* Grand Opera House
and the Alhambra as already in opera
tion, and you will see that we are sup
porting no less than nine legitimately
organized places of amusement, to say
nothing of an expensive symphony so
rWy and the endless procession of
email concerts. Even with fewer thea
tersâand I fear that at least one of
the cheaper ones will not last â the town
is paying handsome tribute to the men
who furnish its entertainment. In fact
there seems to be a theatrical boom
<n the way for San Francisco â a boom
that may ultimately bring us the Met
ropolitan Opera Company, Irving, Duse

will turn out numerously to the produc
tions of higher grade. Even the burn
ing of the Baldwin did not take away
from the success of "Secret Service,"
-which was telegraphed all over the
country. And we will get other big
metropolitan successes just as soon as
they can be spared from New York.
And In immediate prospect is a strong
stock company seasonâ not a Frawley
uncertainty, but a band of picked play
ers, headed by Henry Miller and Ed
ward Morgan, in the best available
plays of the period. In the little Broad
way offices of New York where all the
Beasons are schemed they are beginning
to take us seriously and are willing to
provide us with a clean and moderately
literate drama. And we can thank our
selves for having brought about this
condition. It was hard on us while the
famine lasted, but our persistent dis
esteem for cocktail carnivals and un
derclothes orgies masquerading as dra
matic fare, and our cheerful patronage
of anything serious or worthy, have
finally won out, and our situation is
now much less remote than the map
would make It out to be, and we are in
the way to have not only a lovely fu
ture, but a nice new little past. This
Ellis season of grand opera will, from
every indication, be a big pecuniary
success. It will be an artistic succesa,
too, let us hope; but just now it is the
pecuniary part of it that counts most
in our theatrical fortunes. Let Melba
and this company do two weeks of
record business and we have thrown
the Golden Gate wide open for the
greatest shows of the world.

was such that he is liable to be black
listed from society. Poor Horace Drum
mond denies all charges, but circumstan
tial evidence is so strong that he goes to
his senior partner, who is likewise named
Drummond, and tells of the accusation.
The partner, to shield himself, has Horace
shoulder the blame and thereby win the
record which his wife so covets. Horace
consents, and the complications are gay
and numerous.
Jhe Orpheum.
The Orpheum has five new acts an
nounced for this week. At the head o*
the list are the famous Twins Marco, ec
centric comedians, and who are credited
with being the cleverest in their line In.
all Europe. Francois Nivens . and his
troupe of acrobatic monkeys and clown,
baboons are another novelty brought from
Europe for the Orpheum circuit, and
along with them come the Fortunia
Brothers, comedy acrobats. Ola Hay den,
the famous contra-tenor, is expected to
furnish a pleasing number, as she was a
prime favorite when here one year ago.
She has all new songs. Hayden and
Hetherton also return with a new comedy
skit, in which Queen Hetherton will intro
duce a number of songs written for her
by Joe Hayden, the author of "A Hot
Time." Those retained are Cora Tanner
and Louis Massen, the Four Eddys and
the Hulines. â "" rX

THE HAY MARKET.
The circular of George Morrow & Co. says:
"Receipts for the week, 2052 tons. The re
ceipts have been neither light nor heavy, and
yet we are confronted with an exceedingly dull
"market. Holders seem disposed to let go and
buyers are very shy about making offers for
nnything except strictly choice wheat hay, and
even that article has gone off in price to some
extent. The market showed every sign of
weakness on Monday and Tuesday, but
Wednesday's rain, although It did not amount
to much, certainly tended to make matters
ptii: worse. Reports from most sections of the
State Indicate that with seasonable showers
during the current month this State will have
a good average hay crop. As there Is no rea-
Fon to suppose wo will not have the showers so
much desired, now that the ice has been ,
broken, so to spenU. it is hardly reasonable
to expect any material Improvement in values :
In the near future, llnd the rain not come as j
It did, we are inclined to think the market j
might have picked up a little."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 4â The stock market
to-day worked upward under the impetus of â 
yesterday's movement until the appearance of
the bank statement showing a loss of over
$r.. 000. 000 In the surplus reserve, and another
expansion In the loan accounts. Prices lm- j
mediately gave way sharply In many shares, j
the recession being from 1 to 2 points, and
leaving the standard stocks fractionally below j
yesterday's figures. A good tone prevailed on !
Ixindon exchange for Americans, but advices
the nature of the purchases were con- I
fllctlng. some Intimating that the movement j
was initiated from this side, while others af- '
firmed It to be confident buying for English
investment account. There were sharp ad
vances early here in the Bteel stocks, the an
thracites, Tobacco, Brooklyn Transit, General
Electric an.l prominent railways, the latter
Improving In some cases. Reports of some !
of the large bull Interests seemed to lend sup- j
port to Burlington and the Steel stocks. New
York Airbrake was a very strong spot, after ,
the appearance of the bank statement, when
everything sold off. Many of the early buy- I
eys threw over stocks an.l the market closed I
weak at the lowest. Stocks In which luss-s
occurred for the week outnumber those which
advanced over t\i to 1. The market opened
with a show of strength on Monday, and there
after sagged until Friday, when a better tone j
prevailed up to the appearance of the bank ;
statement, when prices eased off. The more
prominent declines were Third Avenue Rail- '
road. 21; Metropolitan. 7; Pittsburg C. C. and '
St. Louis, !<. Burlington, Central Pacific and ]
Pacific Mall over 4 each. The conspicuous
exceptions to the general tendency were Am- â 
erican Tobacco and American Steel, the former
rising M 4. while the latter was up !%.
A false rumor that Admiral Dewey hjyl sunk ]
a German cruiser exerted an unsettling inflvi- â¢
*n. c on the market which was not altogether
dissipated by the emphatic denials of the j
rumor. The underlying conditions were no less
favorable than formerly, while there were
many evidences of prosperity in commercial
and financial circles. The prevailing feeling
of confidence was reflected by the advance in
the wages of iron and cotton workers In vari- |
ous sections of the country. The balance of
trade, usually considered dependent so largely ,
ireign demand for cereals, whs
strengthened very much by the increasing ex- '
ports Â'" domestic manufactured articles which
are exceeding the imports by about 25 per
cent. Indeed, ttoe exports of such articles
average in value - for each working
flay, commercial activity was also shown by
the Increase in the bank clearings of 4u per
cent for the week, as compared with the cor
responding period of lust year. The continued
demand for iron and Bteel products at rising
figures had a stimulating influence on Bhares
of companies connected with the trade. The
gradual contraction in the surplus reserve
shown In the weekly bank statement, together
with an expansion in the loans, cannot be re
garded as remarkable when It Is consides*rd
that money has been needed to finance many
railway deals, but more particularly colossal
Industrial combinations.
The capitalization of such concerns organized
wlthil. two months exceeds $1,500.0U0.00<J. Then
large sums were required to car- for American
stocks returned from abroad, but there were in
dications that some of these stocks were al
ready beginning to be reshipped to London. A
hardening ratÂ»Â» for money appeared at one
time, call money touching -M 4. but subsequently
r-asing off to VA per cent. The higher rate's
were established or. securities which lack an
active market. It is usual for money to be
mcving toward the interior at thi:- time. "but the
temporary appearance of a higher rrfca f e started
an Influx of money to New V. rk.
The inirn vement In the money rate was
promptly followed by a decidedly easier tone
In the sterling exchange market, which was
taken to indicate the probability of America's
draw. ntr DBon Ub funds lo.ir.<><l abroal -should
the money rates rise sharply. The import of
marly $25,000,000 in gold at San Francisco with
in th<Â» last seven months has not attracted
much attention in the East. This inflow, how
ever, has been fully reflected in the weekly
bank statement x>f New York Institutions froiii
week to week Scale buying by the leaders < f
tne street, together with some commission
hoove purchasing, absorbed the offerings of
timid holders and traders at times when prices
were aJ-out lowest.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, March 4.â The Financier sayÃ:
The statement of the New York Clearing House
1 ynks Tor the week ending March 4 shows a
fall of $1,756,775 In surplus reserve, bringing
the total excess of cash to $24,587,125. This
Is a decrease of about $4,000,(XX> since the clos
lnK week in January. In the same time the
loans have expanded $r>4,333.0y0 and deposits
more than $.'.3,000,000. As a five weeks' record
this advance has never been equaled. Had
the interior called for funds In the usual vol
ume the present surplus reserve would have
been very much less than reported. Conditions,
however, are such that receipts until within
a week or two have been sufficient to counter
act in large part the increase in the re-- i â 
requirements. Now that the movement from
the Interior is temporarily less, the constant
loan and deposit expansion Is having Its full
effect on the surplus money on hand. Hut
when the full scope of the operations of the
past month Is considered. It is to be said fur
the banks that they are making a wonderfully
strong showing. They have met the demand
for funds fur new trusts, financed the return
of American securities for Europe, supplied an
unusually heavy stock exchange demand and
absorbed the large volume of paper Incident to
the present trade revival.
The current statement, therefore, while In
teresting in its changes, must be regarded na
reflecting a culmination of previous conditions.
The reduction of 54.251.200 In specie Is test
than the $.",000,000 decrease reported by one
bank and la due to the smaller interior receipts
and operations with the sub-treusury covering
the past ten dayx. the previous week's state
ment not having shown these losses fully. The
increase in loans Is heavier than expected, but
In this Item also more than the current week's
business Is Included. The cash decrease oper
ated to reduce deposits and the total ex pan si en
was only $4, 236.700. This is less than the in
crease of jr.. 000,000 reported by the Chase Na
tional, showing a real decrease on the part of
the remaining sixty-two banks. The financing
of new trusts had a zreat deal to do with the
deposit changes. The slight advance in rates,
which the Btatement forecasts, will probably
bring a great deal o r money to New York
within the next two weeks.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 4.â The Commercial Ad

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 4.â The world's shipments
of wheat and flour for the week were placed at
near 9,000,000 bushels and the predicted oold
wave which caused some apprehension yester
day had not put in an appearance by the time
business commenced. With such Juicy meat
for their morning: meal the bears felt so lusty
and strong that they knocked Vie >>ff the price
of May as soon as they got a good chance at
It. The conclusion that they evidently came to
on observing the heavy tone of wheat the for
eigners had taken this week was that the
latter did not know what they were about, as
the weekly requirements of foreign wheat by
Importing countries amounts to only 7,000,000
bushels. Reports from California thnt the
wheat crop prospects were critical on account
Of continued drought caused early sellers to
become somewhat anxious and a 'light rally
set in near the close. May closed at 72% c, a
loss of %c.
Corn receipts were considerably heavier than
expected and the dry weather led to the ex
pectation of freer offerings from the country

In the near future. That vf&s presumably the
reason for the abandonment early in the ses
eion of a considerable-sized line of long corn.
The market felt the effect of that selling and
ruled heavy throughout. May closed %c lower.
Oats ruled weak and lower in sympathy with

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been nine arrivals of coal from
Washington with 19,478 tons; three from lirlt- j
lsh Columbia," 9218 tons; one from Oregon, 450
tons; three from Australia, 7242 tons; one from
Cardiff, 2874 -tons; total, 39,262 tons. The ar
rivals this year to date are slightly in excess
of the deliveries of .IS9S, and the generous
amount at hand this week will supply all im
mediate requirements. There is no change to
note in prices, and trade generally Is reported
good In the fuel line. The outlook for a rain
storm is now more encouraging, and the few
light showers we have had this week are
bringing buyers and sellers closer to each
other,' so that business for future loading
grows more promising. Several new names
have been added to the loading list in Aus-.
tralia, which now numbers nearly as many as
last year This is astonishing with the pres
ent high freights now ruling for coal. There
Will be a serious decline In all foreign coal j

"The Coast mines are reaping a harvest again
this year, as over SO per cent of our fueP is
furnished from those sources, and the delivery
price here leaves a generous profit. So long as
they are freed from labor troubles and acci
dents, the Northern mines are valuable prop
erty. It Is now a long time since the Coast
collieries have had any serious setbacks."

FARE .. u n .....MaBOYS AND GIRLS PAGE
OU will know that
the Lady of the
Black Robe, escap
ing by magic from
the Three Kingdoms
of Zybokar, has
tened to the aid of
Alfred and Arthur.
Tou will know also
that Egbert, who
now wore the crown
and name of King
Kahtola, ruled with
out betraying that
he was Egbert,
which was very
easy to do while he
kept Atoll In a dungeon, away from
the sons of Atrld, the black dwarfs.
We will leave Egbert for the present
and tell what happened to Alfred, who
tvas deep under ground.
Three good giants lived in the desert
of Abo-Kinnaar. To them came the
Lady of the Black Robe, disguised as a
rabbit. When they saw what they
supposed to be a rabbit they all tried
to catch it. The rabbit burrowed in
the sand and, dig as fast as ever they
r-ould, the rabbit went down a little
faster than the giants could go.
"Hello: What is this?" said one of
the giants.
No wonder that he was surprised, for
proping under ground he found Alfred
:netead of the rabbit and dragged him
>ut to the daylight.
"Good day, line giants," said Alfred,
"and thank you very much."
"Who are you?"
"Alfred, son of the good King."
"But how came you here?"
Alfred told hie story, to which the
three giants listened with much inter
est.
"I am the champion of the Lady of
the Black Robe," said Alfred. "Help
me to find the kingdom of Atreus, the
brother of King Kahtola, and I will
reward you well."
"What say you, brothers? Shall we
go?"
"Aye," said the three giants, "we will
do what we can to foil the wicked Atoll
and to help the son of the good King."
"The rabbit â what of that?" asked
the giants.
"I cannot tell you; but here are
three little bits of fur. Fasten them to
your caps and they will do you good."
"A charm," laughed the three
giants. "We need little of charms, for
who shall stand against our strength?"
Alfred then told them of the croco
diles and of the Lady of the Black
Robe.
There was a mighty spider In a cave
In the desert, who spun webs like a
cable for strength and who was wise
before all things that live in the des
ert. To this cave the giants are come
with Alfred, and the spider says:
"Al;iek-a-dayâ you ask me -the way
to the Three Kingdoms of Zykobar. If
I tell you that will mean death for
me."
'"It will mean death to you now," said
Alfred, hotly, at the same time draw
ing his sword, "if you do not tell us.
We will not be trifled with. Speak."
With a quick movement, so quick
that neither Alfred nor the giants
ONLY 5 years old, and yet she has
been eight times around Cape
Horn, has crossed the equator
sixteen times, visited half the
ports in America, sailed into
many of the ports of the old world,
played hide and seek in the Orient and
knows the southern seas almost as well
as an inland trader.
This little traveler is a native daugh
ter of the Golden. West. Her name is
Gladys Margaret Graham, and she re
turned to her birthplace after an ab
sence of two years on the brand new
American phip Erskine M. Phelps re
cently. Gladys is as bright and as
beautiful a little maiden as ever trod
a ship's deck, and a thorough sailor
lassie. She knows all about the spank
er boom, can box the compass and tell
the difference between the topsail and
pkysail yards. In an instant she can
hi that the ship William F. Bab
cock, on which she was born in San
Francisco Bay, had fore, main and miz
zen masts.
Gladys' father Is the commodore of
the Bewail fleet of ships. He worked
his way up in the employ and now
commands the first American sailing
ve s feel built of American steel in an
ican shipyard, the Erskine M.
Phelps. He was here two years ago in
command of the ship William F. Bab
cock, but left her when she arrived at
Baltimore in order to superintend the
fitting out of his new command, ffifl
wife and little daughter have accompa
nied him in all his voyages, and that
is how it comes that Gladys has been
eight times around the rape of storms.
She has been in New York, Philadel
phia, Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco,
Tan -a Seattle, Port Townsend in the
States Victoria and Vancouver
In British Columbia; Hiogo, Nagasaki
and Yokohama in Japan; Hongkong
and Shanghai in China, Newcastle and
Sydney in Australia, Honolulu, London
and Liverpool and a dozen other places.
Yet like many another child of the sea,
the port she likes best is the one she is
bound for.
"When we are at sea I have lots of
fun," said Gladys. "If it is fine weath
er I play around the deck, and when it
is very rough I play in the cabin. When
the ship is rolling it's great fun to slide
along the floor. The sitting room floor
is beautifully polished and It makes a
fine slide, and the Erskine M. Phelps
rolls just right to make it nice. I sit
down <">n the starboard side, ajid when
she rolls to port down you go. Then
you have just time to turn around and

web around them.
"Ha, ha," laughed the spider, as the
four struggled helplessly, and without
strength to break a single mesh of the
powerful web, "brave talk is cheap.
Stay you there awhile until I am ready
for my breakfast."
Alfred saw that he had made a dread
ful mistake, but he did not waste any
time grieving. "The fur," he whis
pered to the giants when the ugly
spider had gone to sleep.
The giants handod the fur to Alfred,
who rubbed the three pieces together.
To the surprise of all, the fur became
one piece. Not only that, but there
was suddenly a rabbit in the fur. The
rabbit, having wonderfully sharp teeth,
could, little by little, gnaw the webs
apart that the giants were not able to
break when the meshes of web were
all a source of strength to the web.
Quietly but rapidly the rabbit worked:
When one rope of the web was gnawed
through all fell apart and Alfred and
the giants were free once more. The
spider awoke, but too late to catch the
four friends, who thought best not to
deal with the spider any more.
Alfred carried away a long rope taken
from the spider's web. As Alfred and
the giants journeyed the sky was dark
ened by a huge flock of birds which
were traveling toward the mountains
that form the eastern boundary of an
unknown land. These birds were larger
and more powerful than any eagles.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1899.
THE LADY
OF THE BLACK ROBE
They were Rocs â such as you have read
about in the "Arabian Nights." The
giants warned Alfred to hasten to bury
himself in the sand before the birds
should decide to prey upon him. Alas!
Alfred was about to be torn from his
brave and strong comrades. The giants
and Alfred hid themselves and heaped
the sand above them.
. "Brother Rocs," said the leader of the
fiock, "I smell the rope of the great
spider of the desert. Let us search, for
if we find it we need hunt no more, for
the rope has power to snare even a
lion and to hold him fast. Good luck, I
can see from this height that the rope
is below me, shining in the sand."
just npw.
"One day when Gladys Amelia Bailey
and Susan Anthony Brown â these are
my dolls, you knowâ and I were playing
about thedeck we saw a bark ahead of
us. Our ship soon passed her, and my
papa told me the other vessel was the
bark Temuco, from Chile for Puget
Sound. I think there must be a little
girl aboard that vessel that Santa Claus
did not get to sea, for after we passed
pectations" of it being a swell affair.
"Hildegarde's Home," that quaint old
Downward from his dizzy height in
the air swooped the Roc. The rope
had been fastened by Alfred about his
waist that he might not lose It. In his
haste to cover himself with the sand
Alfred had failed to pull all of the rope
in out of sight. Without a warning,
and just as he was thinking that he had
escaped from the awful Rocs, he felt
himself whirled through the air at such
a speed that he could hardly catch his
breath.
The rope unwound, and Alfred hung
dangling in the air, swinging to and fro,
like an enormous pendulum, far above
the earth. He would not call out to the
giants for fear that he would betray
the Temuco a big sea broke aboard our
ship and washed Gladys Amelia Bailey
and Susan Anthony Brown and my doll
buggy overboard. They were carried
right down to that bark and were taken
aboard, I'm sure. Now my papa is go
ing to watch for the arrival of the Te
muco at Victoria, and as soon as she
makes port he is going to write to the
captain and ask him to send me back
my dolls. And we're going to have a
tea party Just as soon as they arrive.
"I'm going around the Horn again
with papa and mamma. From San
Francisco we are going to Honolulu. I
like Honolulu, but I don't like the mos
quitoes. From Honolulu we will go to
New York with a load of sugar, so we
will have to double the cape again.
"Have you ever seen Mother Carey's
chickens and the albatross and the fly
ing- fish and the sharks? I like Mother
Carey's chickens best. They are so pret
ty aid they fly so fast. They get right
under the crest of the big waves, and
just as you would make sure they
would be drowned they give a dart, and
there they are right under another
wave. And the flying fish are real fish,
and their wings are what papa calls
'elongated fins.' They can't fly very
far, and only jump out of the water to
escape big fish that are chasing them.
"I hope we will make a long stay in
Ban Francisco, as I like it better than
any place in the world. Perhaps when
we get back to New York the ship will
be sent here again, and I think that
would be just splendid. By that time I
will be 6 years old, and mamma says I
will then have to stay ashore with
grandma and go to school. And I don't
want to go to school. I want to live on
the sea and be a sailor, like papa.'
"House of the Seven Gables." must
have caused a pleasant surprise, judg
ing from the exclamations of ohs and
ahs from the girls and "rather neat."
"not bad," from the boys. And truly,
it seemed as though Monte Cristo had
lent the magic of his fingers in trans
forming the usual staid dignified house
into a perfect bower of fragrant love
liness. Flowers were everywhere, in
the parlors, the library, dining-room,
in the halls, while the wide stairs in
the hall "looked like one large rose in
bloom."
"Hildegarde's Neighbors," "The
Grayaons," were the first to arrive, and
after them came the other guests in
quick succession: "Lord Fauntleroy"
(in black velvet and curls) and "Dotty-
Dimple," "Peck's Bad Boy" and that
good little girl. "Elsie Dinsmore."

them to the Rocs. The giants, for their
part, were surprised when, some time
later, they came out from under their
piles of sand to find that Alfred was
missing. As there were no footprints
in the sand to show that Alfred had
run away, the giants concluded after a
little that the whole affair was one of
magic. Then they returned to their
desert home. Alfred, far above the
earth, dizzy and in great danger, was
left alone to do the best he could with
out their aid.
At night the Rocb paused to sleep.
Alfred's weight at the end of the rope
had been so little for the strength of the
Roc to bear that the great bird had not
paid any attention to it. When the
flocks of birds settled at the edge of a
great forest Alfred was seen. He cut
the rope with his sword, which he was
able to do now that his arms were free,
although he could not free himself when
he had been in the web with both his
arms bound fast Next he tried to run
away to hide, but a Roc seized him and
held him fast for the other Rocs to see.
This would have been the end of Alfred

Childhood's hour is passing, soon we two must part:
Would you believe It? It seems as
though "Polly Oliver's Problem" had
been solved by spending "A Summer in
a Canyon," for she came in smiling
with "David Copperfleld." Then "Jack
and Jill" talking of that candypull
which we all know never came off.
"Dame Durden" and "Martin Chuzzle
wit" were followed by that "Old Fash
ion Girl," "Hope Benham," who was
with "John Halifax." Next "Donald
and Dorothy" came tripping in, happy
that they were brother and sister after
so many cruel doubts.
"Gypsy Breyton" came with the
"eight cousins," "Tom Sawyer" and
"Huckleberry Finn," the "Six Boys
from Ingleslde," "Ragged Dick,"
"Rough and Beady," "Mark the Match
Boy," "Tattered Tom," "Julius, the
Street Boy" and "Bob Burton," the
"Seven Little Sisters," "Five Little
Peppers" and all the rest of the young
people. All this time every one was on
the lookout for the Prince. Suddenly
the band struck up and in came "Bon
nie Prince Charlie," and leaning on his
arm, not "Betty Alden" of Pilgrim de
scent or "Lady Jane" of Dixie land, but
"Ramona," that beautiful Californian.
She was simply attired in a gown of
white, with a cluster of golden eschsch
oltzias at her bosom, while two half
opened ones nestled in her raven hair.
"I'd like to have 'Ben Hur,' " said
Gypsy, later in the evening, to 'Huck
Finn,' which remark almost made that
democratic gentleman drop his plate of
ice cream in disgust. Then he told her
of his experience with the Dauphin and
Duke, and converted her to the belief
that the nobility were a "rotten lot,"
while in the library a number of the

"l am in search of the Three King
doms of Zybokar. There must I now
go. The distance is far. Help me to
get there and I will reward you. But
should you refuse to help me, beware
of my vengeance."
This speech so moved the Rocs that
the leader of the flock agreed to carry
Alfred to the' Three Kingdoms.
'"Only one may go with me," said Al
fred, wisely. ;
He thought that he would find a way
to deal with one Roc, even the largest
and the fiercest of. the flock, but knew
that he would be betrayed to the ven
geance of the Black Dwarfs by the
presence of a great flock of Rocs, who
would not fail to inquire into the reason
for the appearance of so many strange
birds in their land. He also feared that
he never could escape from so many
Rocs if he did not get away now.
Still hanging by his spider web rope,
but now sitting easily in a swing, Alfred
was carried away the next morning by
the Roc.
"There," said the Roc, looking down,
"are the Three Kingdoms of Zybokar."
"Then we will go down."
The Roc flew down to a farm, where
a black dwarf was plowing.
"This is the very place," said Alfred,
"for me to perfect my charm. Let me

CLEVER SCHEME OF LITTLE DON.
BY ELSA HUGG, SAN FRANCISCO.
AFTER little Don had tasted Mrs.
Baker's apple butter he made a
point of going across the street
to see her every afternoon. Each
time he was treated to a saucer
ful of the dainty and some fine light
bread. This was because Mrs. Baker
loved children and knew what was good
for them.
One day he appeared a little later
than usual, and found Mrs. Baker in
the dining room, dressed to go- out.
"\h Don, you are the very one I have
been wanting to see," said she, gladly.
"I was just going over to ask your
mother if you could go with me to the
park. Wouldn't you like to row on the
lake?" . , . ,
"No," said Don. firmly, as he looked
about the room for some sign of the
apple butter.
"But you will have a ride on the mer
ry-go-round besides. Then there are the
donkeys and the bears."
where 'I may annoint the end of thÂ«
ror>e Then the charm will be good.
Then you will be a magician, as I am.
and you will be able to rule over every
land that is shadowed by your mighty
wings. Fly low and follow me.
The Roc did as he was commanded.
The black dwarf who was plowing ran
Svard Alfred to seize him. Alfred took
oW^f the end of the spider â¢ b Â«Â»?
and threw It In a noose over the head of
the dwarf.
â¢â¢Fly away, fly away," screamed Al
fred, "for he has spoiled the charra
and will ruin us both."
The stupid Roc obeyed, and as thÂ©
rope tightened the black dwarf was
swept aloft in the air. The ; rope was
around his body, bo that it did not pre
vent him from crying out to the other
dwarfs in the field, "Save me.
The dwarfs hurled stones with slinga
at the Roc who, seeing so many ene
mies, decided to go as far away as pos
sible.
Alfred hid behind a tree until all thÂ»
dwarfs, racing over the hills in pursuit
of the Roc, had gone out of sight. Then
he went into the farm house, which was
quitÂ© deserted. He ate a good dinner,
cooking it himself, and was pleased be
cause his plan had worked so well.
"Ha, ha," he chuckled, "I have done a
very good day's work, for I am in the
Three Kingdoms of Zybokar. I have
rid myself of the Roc and the black
dwarf who owned this farm both at
once, and I am feeling very well."
How fared Arthur, the third son of
the good King, who was, when we last
saw him, struggling against a quick
sand that was threatening to swallow
him? We shall see. D. H. W.
(To be continued.)
"Ramona."
So the evening was spent, and when
the sweet sad strains of "Home, Sweet
Home" was heard, all of our friendsâ
"Our Mutual Friends"â gave three
cheers for "Queen Hilda." Soon "The
House of Seven Gables" was all in
quietness and the Maule roses swayed
gently back and forth to the music ol
Alice Pyncheon's harp.
"I don't care for those things any
more," said Don. With this he fastened
his eyes on the door of the closet where
the apple butter was kept, and heaved
a very deep sigh as he wondered how
Mrs. Baker could be so forgetful.
"Why, what is the matter with you,
Don?" asked the lady as she finished
buttoning her glove.
"Oh, nothing much!" burst from him.
"Only I do-nt care to hear about tha
lake and the merry-go-round, nor any
donkeys and bears!"
"Well, what do you like to heaa
about?"
"Mrs. Baker"â and Don gazed at hei
as though she had done him a wrong,
and spoke in his softest, sweetest toneâ
"just let's talk about the apple butter."
Mrs. Baker laughed so she had to sil
down. When she arose she went to thai
closet for a saucer overflowing with ap
ple butter and some sponge cake. Aftei
Don had eaten he said he was ready foi
the lake and the merry-go-round, and
the donkeys and bears. He also said
he hoped they would not get back til!
dark.

in the French army, and the story con
cerns itself with his love affair with his
cousin, who follows him through the Ca

maid. The story is as good as modern
romantic fiction affords. The authors

The recent suc
cess of the Brit

Mahdists in the
Soudan demonstrates that even fanati
cism cannot stand against drill and dis
cipline. But in earlier days it is easy to
understand why the Arabs swept all be
fore them. An ingenious tenet of Mo
hammed taught his followers that the
hour and minute and second of death
were fully ordained. Therefore the be
lieving soldier's self-regardless fighting
was for a while invincible. Confucius
