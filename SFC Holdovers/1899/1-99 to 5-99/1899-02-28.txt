AGUINALDO IS READY TO QUIT,
GERMANY MAY MAKE TROUBLE
THE FILIPINOS
SAY THEY WANT
NO MORE FIGHT
Eight Thousand of Them Are
Now More Than Willing to
Lay Down Their Arms.
MANILA, Feb. ij. â Two Spanish commissioners,
Senores Rosario and Obogado, who were permitted to pass
through the American lines and confer with Aguinaldo
with reference to the Spanish prisoners at Malolos, returned
through the lines this morning, near Caloocan, with sealed
dispatches for the Spaniards.
The commissioners said that Aguinaldo and Santico
were both at Malolos and inclined to listen to pacific over
tures. While the Filipinos are not yet prepared to surren
der the Spanish prisoners, they will gladly release two Amer
icans who have been held for six weeks on payment of
$30. the value of the food and clothing furnished to them.
Shortly after the envoys came in the rebels sent in a
flag of truce. Bornelli. comandante in Fernando la Cruz,
and several hundred of the enemy left the Filipinos' lines
crying:
"No quiere mas combate. Americanos
muchos buenos." [Don't want any more
fighting. Americans very good.]
They were met by a party from the American side, and
the comandante said that fully 8000 of his men had had
enough and were anxious to surrender. Among the enemy
in the jungle many women and children were visible. A
woman laid down her rifle and attempted to cross with the
flag of truce party, but she was sent back.
After the party returned to the American lines the
enemy on the right fired a volley, the bullets dropping at
their feet.
WAPHTXOTON 1 , Feb. BT. -It
seems to be assumed in official
cir<--'ifÂ»s h^re that the arrival of
the German cruiser Kaiserin
Augusta at Manila is the cause
of \h* puzzling message of Admiral
Dewey asking for the Oregon, which
the department was so indiscreet as to
make public. This is the flagship of
Admiral yon Diedrich, with whom there
was trouble in the early days of our
occupation of Manila Bay. It is known
to the Berlin Government that the
Washington officials have had reason
to bu man agents at Hongkong
of lending encouragement and even
material Btipport to the Filipino rebels.
It is clear, too. that the coming of the
Kaiserin Augusta at this time will be
considered favorable to their cause by
the rebels. For these reasons the Berlin
authorities, if they are as anxious to
convince America that they are friendly
as Embassador White represents them
to be, should run have detailed this
particular commander to watch events
at Manila at close range.
Evidently Admiral Dewey believes
that trouble may grow out of it. He
has had too much experience with this
German admiral to feel comfortable in
his presence.
War Department officials are gener
ally satisfied with conditions in the
island as indicated in the press dis
,es. Everything tends to show
that no more trouble need be feared in
the Visayan Islands, where the Ameri
can Hag floats over Iloilo, Cebu and the
inland of Negros.
Around Manila, however, apart from
the difficulties which are thought to be-
F^t Admiral Dewey in. the harbor
through the attempted interference by
other powers, the conditions are not so
favorable and a dispatch announcing a
more disastrous battle than has yet
been fought would not be received as
a surprise at the War Department, not
withstanding reports that many insur
gents have shown a disposition to sur
render.
It is thought probable here that Agul
naldo's leaders are desirous of making
a last desperate effort to get within the
American lines, burn Manila and do
whatever other damage they can before
" the arrival of reinforcements which
they know to be on the way. The
Grant, according to yesterday's dis
patches from General Lawton, will
reach Manila about March 12. She will
be followed by the Sherman and Sheri
dan and by April 15 all of the troops
now on the way to the islands will have
landed, according to the calculation of
the officials here.
The medical force now on the islands
is believed to be sufficient for ordinary
purposes and to meet any demands of
the future. The hospital ship Relief,
which will sail from New York direct
for Manila by the Suez route in a day
'or two, will carry 150 picked men from
the hospital corps and about ten doc
tors will also be aboard. This is in ad
dition to the regular equipment of doc
tors and nurses of the Relief. The ves
sel will be placed at the disposal of
General Otis, either as a floating hos
pital or for use in transferring the sick
and convalescent to the Federal hos
pital now under way at San Francjsco.
The Relief if loaded with all the medi
cal supplies that she can carry, though
there has been no official call from the
Philippines for such supplies. The au
. thorities there .have full authority to
obtain . al! supplies of any character
that are wanted wherever they can be
bought. Lieutenant Colonel "Woodhuli,
deputy surgeon general, is now en
route across the continent for duty as
chitf surgeon at Manila.
The San Francisco Call.
-The officiate of the War -Department
were asked to-day why General Otis
had refused to recognize the commis
sioners who had come to Manila from
i the insurgent headquarters at Malolos
when they came to seek peace. The
reply was that General Otis was act
ing with the greater propriety In this
matter. He was careful not to commit
his Government to any recognition of
Agulnaldo that would make a prece
dent, and then there was always the
best of reasons for withholding confi
dence in every act of the insurgents
j where the placing of trust would im
peril American lives and interests.
The Filipino insurgents will have no
difficulty, in securing amnesty, it- is
said, if they lay down their arms and
; submit unconditionally, for there is no
purpose on the part of the American
commanders to wreak vengeance upon
a submissive foe."
In addition to military reasons why
General Otis should be very cautious in
entering into any entangling negotia
j tions with the insurgents, there is the
I ever-present danger that he might by
failing to be cautious in this particu
j lar give to some jealous foreign power
i a pretext for formal recognition of the
i insurrection with all the embarrassing
I consequences likely to follow.

THEY LET THE REBELS
THROW AWAY BULLETS
MANILA, Feb. 27, 5:30 p. m.â The in
surgents have been comparatively in
active for the past two days. Except
for occasional shots from the jungle
near Caloocan, at San Pedro and alone
the river, all was quiet along the
American lines last night. The troops
have become so used to thiÃ idle night
firing of the rebels that they give it no
attention.
Rebel sharpshooters also continue
their efforts to annoy the American
troops in the daytime. They are al
lowed to waste their ammunition with
little attention until they appear In the
open. Then a single volley, or a shell
generally suffices to drive them to
cover.
In this city absolute quiet prevails.
The order to clear the streets at 7
o'clock has had an excellent effect upon
the natives, and it is enforced rigidly.
The streets are deserted after. 7 o'clock
by all save the patrols and European
residents with passes on business.
Brigadier General King is ill with
gastritis and has been relieved by
Brigadier General Lloyd Wheaton, for
merly colonel of the Twentieth In
fantry.
Advices from the rebel lines 'say the
I most fantastic reports of American
i losses during and since the fires are
| circulated by the rebel leaders. The
Filipinos are told the Americans had
â  200 men killed and hundreds wounded
| during and since the fires.
Advices from Iloilo say all is quiet
i there. The natives who fled at the
â¢ landing of the Americans are returning
!to Iloilo and many are taking the
, oath of allegiance.
The Charleston and Concord are
i patrolling the island in search of fill
i busters.
The Insurance agencies, after confer
ence and receiving instructions from
their home offices, have decided to ac
cept war risks at an additional prem
ium of 5% per cent. Most of the In
surance companies here are English.

BERLIN. Feh. 27.â Copies of the Her
ald containing the reported interview
with Prince Radziwil! arrived this
morning. It caused much antonishment
in political circles that the Prince could
have uttered any such idea concerning
the United Sta^/s.as that Europe should
make a coalition against her.
The Prince, when I saw him at his
palace in Pariser Platz, was most as
tonished of all and exceedingly an
noyed. He said that his feelings re
garding the United States were echoed
by what Baron yon Bulow recently said
in the Reichstag â nothing but the most
friendly. He further declared he had
not talked to any one -for publication
and certainly not in the sense Indicated.
He said later in the day to one of the
Ministers of State that he had made
some friendly remarks abiut France,
but even those especially referring to
the sentiment of the Emperor were nut
uttered. The whole interview was
grossly exasperated.
Later the Prince sent to me the fol
lowing letter for publication:
To the Special Correspondent of the
New York Herald: .In answer to your
question about the interview I can as
sure you that you could not 'be more as
tonished than myself by the article of La
Liberte. I received M-. Salanson in Paris
because of the recommendation of a
friend and because I thought it was a
personal affair. M. Salanson found a
third person in my room. There was a
short general conversation, but I had no
idea I was being interviewed.
I have certainly not said any word
which could be interpreted in a sense un
friendly for the relations of Germany and
the United States. I decline any respon
sibility in the article of La Liberty.

SMALL NEED FOR
MORE TROOPS AT

Volunteers Will Be Ordered Home
When the Regulars Now En

NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â The Washington corre
spondent of the Herald telegraphs: Serious consideration
was given by the President, Secretary Alger and Adjutant
General Corbin at a conference to-day to the question of
sending additional reinforcements to General Otis. I un
derstand the three transports now at New York or en
route there, the Logan, Thomas and Bufford, will be re
fitted for use in transporting troops to the Philippines,
while arrangements will also be made for sending troops
from San Francisco.
There are now about 8000 troops on their way to Ma
nila, and as General Otis has not asked for any additional
men there is apparently no need for haste in dispatching
more. The volunteers will be brought back on the trans
ports which are carrying the regulars to Manila.
No report from General Otis except a list of casual
ties has been received since Saturday, and the authorities
think that no important developments have occurred. They
are certain that no foreign marines have been landed, or
General Otis or Admiral Dewey would have tele
graphed.
Secretary Long denied to-day the report that the lowa
had been ordered to proceed to Manila. The lowa needs

GOVERNOR GAGE INDULGES
IN SARCASM ON LEGISLATORS
The Executive Thinks a Little Grammar School Educa
tion Would Be of Benefit.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 27. â Governor Henry T. Gage has come out of
the north. He came on tfce owl train and hied himself at once to his
Downey ranch. He caw George Denis for a brief hour and with a re
porter discussed affairs of state, men and trifles with an abandon that
was the very antithesis of the Gageism during the campaign.
"I believe that the State would be far better off," said the Gover
nor, "if not one of these bills that have been passed should become
law. I say I think the State would be better off."
There was no mistake about what the Governor said. He repeated
the remark, and was most emphatic In condemning: the mass of legis
lation supposed to be enacted for the benefit of mankind.
"I do not wish," continued the Governor, "to condemn any piece of
legislation in particular. My views on the subject of legislative char
acter have reached the public through my veto messages."
"How is it you vetoed the Australian bug law and then changed your
opinion?"
"My position on this matter has been misstated. The bill was in
such a horrible state when it was first presented to me that I could
not possibly sign it. By the provisions of the first bill the expert could
have gone to Paris and had a good, time in the Bois de Boulogne in
stead of chasing the nimble Australian bug in the land of the leaping
kangaroo." The Governor audibly chuckled as he reflected.
"Some gentlemen who draw up bills do not know what they are
doing." the Governor remarked.
"You think that a little preliminary course at a law college ought
to precede a debut in the legislative ring?"
"I think that a little common grammar school education would work
wonders for these gentlemen," said the Governor.
"There are a great many bills with which I am heartily in sympathy,
but which I have been compelled to veto. Bills have been drawn up so
carelessly and display so incredible an amount of ignorance that it
would have been folly for me to do anything but veto them."
"What do you think of the anti-cartoon bill?"
"I signed the bill. That shows what I think of it."
"But was not the whole business a little hurried?"
'â Not at all. I keep right up with my business. I was ready for the
anti-cartoon bill when it came."
' In reply to a question about patronage the Governor says he is not
giving the subject any attention. In regard to "Whittler patronage, he
had received innumerable applications. Due consideration would be
given each application as it came up in its proper order.
passed around and an agreement en- |
tered into to support Senator Flint, one
of Bard's supporters, for chairman, and
Assemblyman Lardner, a Barnes man,
for secretary. This agreement was
carried out to the letter, though it :
proved to be unnecessary, as the Burns 1
men were too clever to provoke a con
test at the very beginning of opera
tions by putting forward a candidate
for chairman and supporting him with
their full voting strength.
The conference was held in the As
sembly chamber after the afternoon
adjournment. The first act of the
meeting was the selection of Senator
Dickinson as temporary chairman, an
act of courtesy due to him as the ac
knowledged promoter of the conference
scheme. Permanent organization was
then effected by the election of Flint
as chairman and Assemblyman Lard
ner as secretary without contest. As
semblyman Devoto of San Francisco '<
was chosen to act as sergeant-at-arms,
and Assemblyman Kenneally of San
Francisco was selected to act as door
keeper. The conference being Uiub
formally organized, the fun began.
The Burns faction was arrayed solid
ly against every proposition to make
the procedings public. From first to last
they demanded that secrecy character
ize the meeting, and when Crowder of
San Diego, ope of Grant's adherents,
moved to admit the press a one-voiced
roar went up from the ranks of the
man who, at the opening .of thi3 fight,
asked, nay, demanded, thalt the light of
day be turned full upon every act of
his that might transpire.
Crowder's motion was seconded by
Radeliff of Santa Cruz, who is also of
the Grant alignment, and when the
question was put there was a hot fight,
and eventually a successful one, made
against it by the Burns push. Short
ridge of Santa Clara spoke rabidly
against any such proposition. He said
that to do so would be to- tear from the
niches the most sacred traditions of the
Republican party, and in other as ele
gantly turned phrases he did Burns'
bidding. He was ably assisted by Bel-
B ha\v of Contra Costa, of Bulla's forces,
who moved that the motion be laid
upon the table, and then the question
was loudly called for by the Burns
clique, and Belshaw's motion to table'
was carried by a vote of 48 to 31.
Melick of Pasadena said that he had
come into the conference under the
promise that no vote was to be binding,
and that they could take as many votes
as they saw fit, and he would give a
report out to the press if he chose to do
60.
Assemblyman Cosper of Tulare
opened the ball by telling what he did
not know about breaking a Senatorial
deadlock. He called the attention of
the members to the fact that the Legis
lature has been in session for almost
two months and has as yet failed to
elect a United States Senator, as was
its duty. He told at some considerable
length of the welfare of the Republican
party now at stake and pointed out the
necessity of electing a Republican Sen
ator at the present session of the Leg
islature in order to preserve for the
party the full measure of victory gained
At the recent election.
"We are members of the Republican
party," vouchsafed Mr. Cosper, "and.
as such, it is our duty to stand with
William McKinley in this hour when
he is most in need of every good Re
publican. It is our duty to indorse his
policy in the past and his policy for the
future and to do so we must send rep
resentatives to Washington who are in
accord with him and his plans. More
than ever it is our duty to send this
year a representative to the United
States Senate. The people demand it
and so does the administration. This
â deadlock must not 'continue; we must
â¢end it and do our duty by our country
Â»nd party and there is only one way to
do it; the good old way by wnich Re
publicans have settled their difficulties
ever since there has been a partyâ by
caucus. We should caucus on this mat
ter as we have in the past and let the
choice of the majority be the chdice of
ttfl all."
Senator Davis of Amador was not in
.favor of this idea, and said so in words
that could not be misunderstood.
"This is not a question of harmony,
'as Senator Morehouse puts it," he said.
"It is not a question of McKinley, as
Mr. Cosper has just said in his remark
able speech, nor a question of any one
else. It is not as much a question of
Bending some one to the Senate as who
we shall send there. The people of
this State do not so much demand of
us that we send some one to the Senate
as that we send a man there who will
properly represent this State, and we
cannot do that by going into caucus.
Caucus means the election of just one
nian, and despite all that has been said
I know that the people of this State do
not want a caucus at such a price.
"It has been painfully apparent that
these newspaper demands for a secret
ballot have been inspired. The inspira
tion was more than evident, and the
source from which they have eman
ated had been laughably plain to any
one who would see it. Mr. Cosp&r ap
peals to party traditions and party
custom to uphold him in his plea for a
caucus, but never before has the party
been so assailed as now, and to protect
the party and do the will of the peo
ple of this State there must be no cau
cus and we must keep out of one. Let
this matter be settled on the floor of the
house. Let Mr. Burns and Mr. Grant
withdraw from this flgh^ since they
only serve to prevent the selection of
a representative. Leave the field clear
to men who are wanted. That is the
one way to settle this question. Let
the leaders withdraw. It is already de
monstrated that the little fellows can- j
not win and they do no harm. The |
votes that are needed for this State's j
good are held by men who cannot win
apd who are not wanted."
Senator Cutter echoed the attack of
Senator Davis upon Burns and his
mouthpiece, Cosper. He said there was i
only one candidate who wanted a cau- j
cus. That had been clearly demon- !
strated in the persistent refusal of the j
others to entertain any such proposi
tion, and he said by the same token j
that if caucus was the scheme he was
prepared to say for them that they j
would refuse again. The caucus propo
sition could benefit but one man, and
that man the people of the State of Cal- j
ifornia had said they did not want and !
would not have.
"The people of this State," said he, ;
"do not so much want some one elected i
as they want the right man elected, and !
we cannot do that, it is evident, by go- |
Ing into caucus."
Senator Cutter denounced the caucus ;
proposition as a scheme advocated for
the purpose of promoting the candidacy
of a particular man. What men could
do in caucus they could do in open con- 1
vention, he said, and those who were !
anxious to get behind the closed doors j
of a caucus to cast their votes must be :
necessarily actuated by some ulterior j
motive. He believed that the proper I
and the only way to settle the question
was on the floor of the Joint assembly,
where every man's action would be nec
essarily open and aboveboard. If a :
man has convictions, he said, and is not
ashamed of them, he does not fear to
express them in the hearing of all men.
Then came Melick of Pasadena, who
votes for Bulla. It was he who origi
nated the "caucus for the tail-enders,"
who met but once and then made no j
contribution to history. He had a solu- |
tion, two in fact, for the present quan
dary.
"I agree with Senator Morehouse," |
.said Mr. Melick, "we want harmony in
the party, but we want to get it fairly 1
and aboveboard. We cannot get it ;
by going into a caucus that would have ;
but one resultâ"
'Why?" yelled Dibble, and "Why?"
yelled Grovel Johnson.
"Because," shouted Melick, "caucus
means the election of just one man and
he is not the man the people of this
State want. If this deadlock can be j
broken it Is by one of two ways:
"Let the leaders in this fightâ Burns
and Grantâ resign from the lists. They
cannot be elected and that this is a
deadlock at the present day is due
solely to the fact that they will not 1
withdraw. Let them withdraw and |
leave the field clear to a man who will <
be satisfactory to the people. If they |
will not do this let us hold a caucus on
the floor of the House, an open caucus
with nothing of secrecy to it and one at
which the vote of sixty members of the
majority shall be necessary to carry
any question that may come up. That
is a fair proposition and one that I j
think would break this deadlock, and 1
.satisfactorily, too."
"Jt would suit me if all the candi
dates should resign, " said Johnson,
"we will pull outâ I move we now ad
journ until 4 o'clock to-morow after
noon and â "
"I don't see why we should adioura
to to-morrow afternoon," interupted
Cutter, "nothing has been gained by
this conference and nothing can be that
I can see â " . . .
"Something is gained when Mr. 1
Melick approves of a caucus with sixty i
voting as a maiorjty." retorted John
son, and then the chairman was al
lowed to put the vote and the proposi
tion to meet again at 4 o'clock to-mor
row afternoon was carried.
DIBBLE'S CONTROL
OF LEGISLATION
IS NOW BROKEN
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- !
MENTO, Feb. 17.â The control which As- :
semblyman Dibble has exercised over all j
legislation and which since the session |
of ISB9 he has held by the virtue of nq |
more stable power than that of" pure ar- |
rogance, is finally and completely broken, j
As an emulator of Czar Reed Dibble has
been a proportionate success. His chair- ]
manship of the Committee on Rules and j
the almost infallible knowledge of par- j
iiamentary law and usage which he has ;
held over his fellow-members of that j
body have enabled him to make it neither I
more nor less than a steering committee j
for the suppression of the measures of the
unfavored and for the furtherance of the
bills of the wise ones who were of suffi
cient strength and standing to be able to :
offer reciprocal favors.
The files have been almost altogether at ;
his disposal, and so cleverly has he ex- <
ercised his arrogated prerogatives that !
not until the beginning of this last fort- |
night did the green ones of this session
come to an understanding of his system. !
Then It was his own delegation, the
San Franciscans, who took the first step
toward breaking him. They got their
knowledge of Dibble's file manipulation
from Caminettti of Amador, who one day
arose to ask Dibble for an exposition of
the "special Urgency file" and its relation
to the Second and third reading files, j
Mr. Dibble did not explain, but Caminettl
did, ingeniously and politely. In fact he j
threw down the whole scheme.
Next day a type-written agreement em- i
anated from the San Francisco delega
tion binding every one who signed it to
prevent Dibble, in so far as. should be
possible, from playing engineer to the ;
whole legislative machine, and to kill off

as rapidly as they should come up all of
Dibble's pet measures.
The agreement got between twenty-five
and thirty signers, and Dibble s machine
has not been working on greased wheels
since
In their assault, the San Franciscans
were materially aided by Grove Johnson.
In fact. Dibble's troubles had their be
ginning when he went against Johnson
for the leadership of the House in the
early days of the session. The Represen

ing of the written agreement.
It was Valentine, in fact, who gave Dib
ble's control its knock-out blow, and la
no quiet or lady-like language.
It all came out over the financial trou
bles of the city of Placerville, and it hap
pened just before and just after the ses
sion convened this morning. Dibble over
stepped himself, and his dethroning is the
penalty. ' Â , Â
At the request of Drury Melone. the
Napa capitalist. Dibble last week offered
in the Assembly bill 839, which provides
that when municipalities have not held
a general election for more than two
years the Governor shall forthwith ap
point the officials necessary to the oper
ation of the city's government and that
they shall hold office and call a regular
election in due time for the selection of
their successors. On its face the bill pro
vides a general law. In its intent it Is
nothing more than special legislation di
rected at the city of Placerville. The
bonds which that town issued in 1864. to
the amount of $34,500. upon an agreement
which the railroad did not keep, to put
its road through from Folsorn to Placer
ville, are now in the hands of Drury Me
lone, an agent for the original holders.
The alleged debt, with accrued interest
now amounts to $260,000, and it is this dab
of money that Melone and Dibble want to
collect by special enactment.
The Judiciary Committee, of which Dib
ble is a leading member, recommended
that the bill pass upon a BhOrt feplatia^
tion by Dibble, who made no allusion to
Placerville. Assemblyman Raw of El Do
rado, and Valentine, were both out to
kill the measure and were waiting for
the committee to take it up. but contrary
to usual procedure they were not noti
fied The bill was sneaked through and
nothing said. The first intimation of It
had by its friends was its sudden appear
ance in the file!'. Valentine called upon
Dibble to explain such work, and the
clever chairman of the Rules Committee
was quick to promise that when It came
along on the second reading file he would
have it referred to committee and thera
either killed or recommended not to
pass. Saturday it came up duly on the
second reading file and Just before it was
considered Valentine was called out of
the chamber. He left the bill in Cami
netti's hands. Another minute, however,
Caminetti, too, whs hurriedly called, and
relying upon Dibble, who was in the
chair to keep promise, he left the room.
Raw of Placerville was absent. When
the bill came on Dibble, instead of mak
ing his word good, announced that Val
entine and Raw were absent, but that
they desired him to say they had no ob
jection, and he suggested that it be read
and passed to the third reading file. Tak
ing him In good faith, the House followed
his suggestion.
Valentine met Dibble before the House
convened this morning and gave him a
thorough calling down. â  It was a red
hot row and it was renewed by Valen
tine on the floor after the session was be
gun. He openly accused Dibble of bad
faith and would not quiet until Dibble
made emphatic promise that the bill
should be at once rereferred.
It was the most glaring expose that has
yet been made: of Dibble's methods and
if there were any in the House unlearned
before it provided the needed lesson. It
was laughed and talked over for an hour
pfterward. Valentine, who has frequent
ly balked the San Franciscan at other
times, is in a fair way to be promoted
from the leadership of the Los Angeles
delegation to the position Dibble has
usurped as leader on the floor of the
whole House.
SENATORS INDULGE IN
MUCH TALK ON BILLS
PAT.L, HEADQUARTERS,
MENTO, Fob. 27.â The rider to Stratton's
primary election law was passed in the
Senate this morning after some discussion
and two votes in the negative. The ftrig
inal hill provided that clerks who, having !
been duly appointed, refused to act or j
failed to report for duty should be fined
or imprisoned or both. The Governor ob
jected to such a severe possible punish
ment, and said so. It was not desired,
however, to delay the bill, which in other j
respects the Governor favored, so it was
agreed that another bill repealing the
punishment clause in the first bill and
substituting only a fine should he intro
duced in the Legislature and passed. This j
bill was introduced last week, and this j
morning Stratton called it up on an urgen
cy resolution. It was read a second and
third time -and was passed all in ten min
utes. Smith and Davis voted no because
they could not approve of such a pro
cedure.
The Societies for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals were given a slight roast
this afternoon under the consideration of
some amendments to Assembly bill 5 re
garding the' payment of tines. Under the
present law fines from the conviction of
offenders whom it is the duty of the so
cities to suppress go to the society first
formed in the county. An amendment to
this proceeding was proposed, providing
that fines should go to the society making
the arrest. Another amendment diverting
all fines to the school fund was also pro-
Eosed, and this was added to the bill. The
ill itself is a blanket affair "dealing gen
erally with the regulation of such socie
ties
When the bill came up as amended an
other amendment was submitted placing
the law where it was, that is diverting all
fines to the society first formed.
Senator Boyce, chairman of the Com
mittee on Public Morals, was the first to
wax eloquent. He declared the committee
amendment was a means to allow one
society in San Francisco to slaughter an
other He criticized the majority of his
own committee in reporting such an
amendment. The law as it stands suits
those counties where there is but one such
society and the outside members closed
in to take a whack at the rival organiza
tion of San Francisco The spectacle of
humane societies making a specialty of
humstnity for pay was commented 09.
The country members were evidently of
the .opinion that no chestnut of the San
Francisco societies should be pulled from
the fire by them. The time for the con
sideration of Assembly bills having passed
the bill had to go over without action, but
\t will come up again.
Senator Luchsinger's bill to provide for
ttte licensing. o f architects w;a-s passed to
third reading this evening, after weather
ing a vote to deny it a second reading.
The bill provides for a Board of Archi
tects which will examine all who desire
to enter the profession of architecture
and Issue a license to those competent. It
was objected to by Smkh and others as
being on a par w-ith the bills licensing
barbers, horseshoers and plumbersâ a re
striction on the profession and not proper
bill appropriating *RO.
--000 for the completion of the State Normal
School at San Diego was passed to third
reading after being cut down to $4d.000.
Senator Rowell's bill relating to assess
ments of property was also passed to
third reading, and survived an attack in
the shape of a motion to deny it engross
ment. Among other provisions was one
which provided for the assessment of all
dep'oslts in commercial banks on March 1
of each year, and it was upon this provi
sion that the opposition showed itself.
SENATORS STILL TALK
ON SAVING TIME
call Headquarters, saqra-
MENTO, Feb. 27.â The Senate took up it.B
favorite subject this afternoonâ the ques
tion of rules. It was an interesting point,
too, the further cutting- of the limit of a
speech from ten minutes to five and from
twenty to ten for of bills under
Senator Shortridge was first to rise in
defense of his right to speak as long as he
pleased. He thought five minutes alto
gether too short a time for any Senator to
air his views. Senator Smith was the most
bitter opponent of the rule, and in support
of his opposition he cited the veto mes
sages of the Governor which were piling
up. Each one, he said, bore a reproach to
the Senate for hasty or ill-considered ac
tion. He said the Senators were not ad
dicted to long speeches, and he did not
believe in limiting them.
Morehouse did not wish to be silenced
either. He believed in discussing meas
ures with due deliberation, and when they
THE SAME OLD VOTE
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SAC-
P-AMENTO, Feb. 27.â Just one bal
lot was taken at noon to-day and
there was little interest shown in
that. The conference of this af
ternoon was the topic of all-ab
sorbing Interest and the hour for
balloting was taken up by Dibble
of San Francisco and Jake Step
pacher in circulating the call to
the conference among those mem
bers who were still holding out.
Every one but Judge Clough, Con

the vote was announced and Step

The vote was as follows:

were of sufficient importance without re

In support of his position he read from
Assembly bill 6, which, after being con
sidered by the Assembly, had been passed,
and yet a clause allowing the sale of an
animal "or any part thereof" to satisfy
a lien had been left in the bill.
Shortridge spoke again on his oft-re
peated theme, "Trivial Legislation. he
said the trouble lay in the number of
bills needlessly introduced, not in tne
speech-making. . ..
The rule was adopted, however, and the
Senators must cut short their remarks.
The rule recommended by the commit
tee, providing for the consideration of tno
special files and the third reading, brought
more useless talk, for it. too. was adopt
ed. It was pointed out that the rule made
no provision for the consideration of the
second reading file, and come of the Sena
tors objected to being compelled to place
their bills awaiting second reading on the
special file. It did no good to object, how
ever, for the lule was adopted.
ASSEMBLY ROUTINE
WENT SMOOTHLY ON
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 27.â The Committee on Cor
porations rendered to the Assembly this
morning a report ifoon all the bills that
have been before it looking to the curtail
ing of the rights and assumed privileges
of the big corporations.
Assembly bill 810, by Crowder of San
Diego, provides a uniform maximum rate
for telephone instruments and telephone
service in this State. It was reported with
out recommendation.
Assembly bill %0, also by Crowder, es
tablishes a uniform rate Of 3 cents per
mile on all railroads in California for first
class travel, and a rate of 2ft cents per
mile on second class travel. It was re
ported as was its companion measure.
Mr. Crowder also introduced -Assembly
bill 9*61. which provides that no railroad or
sleeping car company shall allow the up
per berth of a section to be lowered unless
the same has b.een sold. This last bill of
Mr. Crowder's was killed off in the same
quiet and painiess manner as its fellows.
The Committee on Rules and Regula
tions offered a report which â¢ fixes the
evenings of Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday of this week as the time for the
consideration of the appropriation bills on
the Ways and Means Committee's special
urgency file. The evenings flrst decided
upon were Monday, Tuesday and Wednes
day. The third reading file has been
made the order for this and to-morrow
evening.
Assembly bill 192, which provides for a
laundry, heating ilight ana power plant
for the. Home for Feeble-minded Children,
was ricommend^d to pass by the Com
mittee on Ways and Means, as was also
Assembly bill 252, which authorizes the
State Controller to appoint an additional
clerk to be known as the revenue clerk.
Assembly bill 741, creating the office of
State Game Warden, and Assembly bill
86, appropriating $17,500 for the erection of
two male wards at the Mendocino, Ukiah,
Asylum, were both amended by the same
committee and recommended to pass ;is
amended. Assembly bill 87, which appro
priated $20,000 for the erection of a build
ing to connect the administration build
ing with the ward buildings of the same
institution, was recommended to "not
pass."
In a message from the Governor apropos
of 287 and 288, vetoed by him on Saturday,
the Executive takes another swat at leg
islative English.
In referring again to the bills he says:
"In my message tx> your honorable body
of this date, February 25, 1899, disapprov
ing Assembly bills 287 and 288. a miscon
struction of the bills appears in the mes
sage, owing to the ambiguity of the lan
guage of the bills, which error, in justice
to the clerk of the Supreme Court, I de
sire to correct.
"The message referred to states that
by. the said Assembly bills an additional
stenographer is created, thereby increas
ing the salary to be paid to the deputies
in the aggregate annual Bum of $2400. This,
however, is incorrect, as there is but one
office created, namely, that of chief depu
ty with an annual salary of $2400, and one
of the other six deputies; (designated
therein as a stenographer) is to receive a
salary reduced to $1200, so that the aggre
gate annual increase is $1800.
"Notwithstanding this correction, my
views as to a necessity for any increase
in thÂ« number of deputies in the office re
main unchanged, and I am still of the
opinion that at this time there is no urg
ent necessity for thl^eput^. â
Dibble of San Francisco, who, with Cobb
of the same town, has been engineering
the Assembly end of the Republican con
ference to come off later this afternoon,
asked of the Assembly the *xclusive use
of the chamber for the Republican ma
jority Â»t 4 o'clock. It was so ordered, no
dissenting vote being: cast to his resolu
tion.
Dibble also offered a resolution to put
an end to the usual morning tardiness.
During the last few days there has not
been a quorum In the chamber more than
half the time and file work has been often
delayed In time consuming calls of the
House. , .. . ,
To assure a working force in the future
Dibble offered this resolution:
"Resolved, That it is the sense of the
Assembly that no committees should be
excused during the remainder of the ses
sion and that no committee should be
allowed to sit, except conference commit
tees, during the sess-ons of the House:
also that no member should be excused
from attendance except for sickness of
himself or family."
The resolution was adopted.
Assemblyman Cowan handed up an
other anti-tax-eater resolution from Glen
Ellen Grange. It demanded that fully
2T) per cent of the money now wasted in
useless commissions" be saved to the
State and also that all salaries be slashed
the same per cent. "In short,' finishes
the resolution, "less favors for tax-eaters
and immediate relief for taxpayers.
Assemblyman Valentine's bfll, ao4. was
passed to-day after a hard fight put up

of the bill, by the San Francisco Harbor
The ' fneas'ure provides that all State

be paid monthly to the State Controller,
to be by him disposed of among the re-
SP Valen e tlne n argued his bill strongly, and,
despite contrary Indications, when it
came to a vote there were not more than
a half dozen members against it.
Senator Sammy Braunhart s seawall
bill kicked up another debate of no small
proportions. Melick of Los Angeles said
that the- $1,000,000 which the bill" proposes
to raise by a bond issue was to be thrown
to the mob of political hangers-on that
the Harbor Commission has been feeding
for years past at the State's expense. He
said that the Harbor Commission was
nothing more than a political machine
and an expensive one. It had already
spent all its own tolls and other receipts
and this $1,000,000 was simply a scheme to
provide more. _, â .
Dibble denied It was anything of the
sort. He said that not one cent of the
proposed $1,000,000 could be spent for any
other purpose than set down in the billâ
the seawall. He was followed by Valen
tine, who also followed the same line of
argument. He was shut off by the noon
hour, however, and further consideration
went over to afternoon, when it passed.
Caminettis Assembly bill 988, giving
permission to the Native Sons to use the
great seal of the State in striking: oft
medals for the boys of the First Califor
nia, was also passed with a unanimous
YOtâ¬
Knowland's Assembly bill 292, relating
to erroneous tax assessments ana saie^,
was passed without debate.
Assembly bill 37, by Wade, relating to
the recording of leases, sales or hire of
street railroads and equipment, was
passed.
Belshaw's Assembly bill 500, which pre
vents the Attorney General granting per
mission to State commissions to hire out
side legal advice and compelling him to
render such service himself, was passed
after an explanation by the author.
The Governor's veto of Assembly bill
229, which made the golden poppy the
State flower, was made the special order
for Thursday.
Belshaw's Assembly bill 4SO, making it
a misdemeanor to sell liquor to habitual
drunkards or to minors, was passed, as
was Mack's Assembly bill 150, amending
the laws relating to estrays.
Assembly bill 57fi, a substitute for As
sembly Bill 70, amending the act provid
ing for the creation or sewer districts,
was also passed.
An important bill by Dibble, 552, which
provides that all certificate and debenture
companies shall be under control of the
State Bank Commisaioners, was passed,
and so also was Dibble's Assembly bill
260, which provides that gravestones
costing not In excess of $10 shall be pro
vided for all Union Boldiers who shall die
without sufficient funds for burial ex
penses. . â
The third reading file consumed the
evening session, and adjournment was
taken to to-morrow morning.
SEAWALL BILL
PASSES THE SENATE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 27.â Senator Sammy Braun
hart's seawall bill came up In the As
sembly this afternoon on Its final pass
age and was carried with only a few
scattering votes against it. The result
of the vote was a surprise to those on
the floor, for there was a hard fight made
e gainst it, but for once all three of the
leaders stood in and the opposition did
not count.
Melick of Los Angeles bitterly scored
the San Francisco Harbor Commissioners.
He said that they had prostituted their
office and spent its funds in cheap politics.
The commission, he said, had become
nothing more than a gigantic political
machine, and that every dollar spent by it
â¢was calculated for political effect rather
than the improvement it would pay for in
the State's property. He said that the
proposition embodied in the bill to raise
by a bond issue the sum of $1,000,000 was
a scheme to throw to. them more money
to go the way that the tolls and tariffs
they collect go.
Dibble of San Francisco, who has had
charge of the bill in its course through
the Assembly, denied that this was so,
and said that not one cent of the mill
ion could be spent in any but the way
laid down in the bill for the completion
of the seawall. He was backed by Val
entine and the question prevailed. It had
few other than Melick's vote against it.
"JOKER" DOESNT GO IN
COUNTY GOVERNMENT BILL
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 27.â Considerable excite-,
ment has been aroused by the expose
made in The Call in regard to the slip
pling in of a "joker" in the county gov
ernment bill, which permitted the San
Francisco county officials to hold office,
regardless of the law laid <Jown by the
acts of the recent charter election, and
this evening at a joint meeting of the
committees on County and Township
Government of both the Senate and As
sembly the obnoxious amendment was
stricken out and a new bill- substituted
which will not interfere with the San
Francisco law.
When the Senate convenes to-morrow
the bill, which was rushed through the
joint committee last evening, will be re
called and the substitute introduced,
much to the satisfaction of a number of
legislators who have San Francisco s in
terest in view. ' _ i_ ; i.
There was talk of money used to have
the bill with the "joker" amendment rail
roaded through; but whether it was the
case or not, it was found that at the
joint meeting of Saturday evening the
amendment which was passed upon with
a favorable recommendation previously
by the Assembly committee and not by
the Senate committee in some way passed
into the hands of the clerks, who think
ing that it had been properly passed upon,
â ^"sSufn i P s ri No c which provides
that all county officers elected in San
Francisco in 1898 and whose terms com
menced January 1. 1899. should hold office

trary to the law set down by the char
ter, 'which expressly opposes such a pro
ceeding.
LEGISLATORS WANT TO
KNOW WHOM TO KILL
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 27.â Another newspaper
bill is coming to the surface In the Sen
ateâthis time a restriction upon the col
umns not the pictures. Senator More
house's measure to compel the signing
of certain articles published was read the
eecond time and an amendment making
certain exceptions was adopted.
The hill requires that "every article,
statement or editorial contained in any
newspaper or other printed publication
printed in this State which by writing or
printing tends to blacken the memory of
one who is dead or to impeach the hon
esty, integrity, virtue or reputation or
publish the natural or alleged defects of
one who is alive, and thereby expose him
or her to public hatred, contempt or rid
icule, must be supplemented by the true
name of the writer of such article, state
ment or editorial, signed or printed at
the end thereof." â¢ t .
Continuing, the bill provides that the
printer or publisher who publishes such
an article without the required signa
ture shall forfeit $1000, one-half of which
shall be turned over to the plaintiff in a
suit for such publication and the other
half of the State treasury.
The amendment submitted this evening
provides that in books the name on the
title page will be sufficient and in tele
grams emanating from the same source
but one signature will be required.
There was no discussion on the meas
ure this evening, but there will probably
be a good deal when the bill comes up for
final passage.
Work of Judiciary Committee.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, February 27.â At the meeting of

evening the following bills were reported
favorably upon: Assembly bills numbers
680, 210, 209. 467, 99, 908, 941, and Senate bill
93. Bill 680 relates to attachments. Bill
210 is an act relating to proceedings on
production of foreign wills. No. 209 re
lates to petitions for probate of wills.
No. 467 is an act regarding the heaVing
of proofs of probate of foreign wills, bill <
99 is in relation to the foreclosure and j
sale of mortgaged lands. Bills 908 and ;
941 relate to witnesses in the various j
courts. Senate bill 93 repeals certain sec- j
tions of the Political. Code pertaining to j
taxes and revenues. Bill 386 was reported
back with- an unfavorable recommenda
tion. It adds a new section to the Civil
Code relating to the sale of personal
property when the title thereof is re
served in the vendor until it is paid for.
A number of business men of Sacra- ,
mento, representing various lines of busi- ;
ness, appeared before the committee in
opposition to the bill. They contended
that it would seriously injure business in
terests, and it was evidently through their
Intervention that the bill met with what
will probably bo its deathblow.

KNIGHT RETURNS
EAGER FOR THE
SENATORIAL FRAY
A Crisis in the Situation Now Attracts the
Dark Horses.
DAN BURNS HAS REACHED HIS END
The Campaign of Blnff, Bluster, Booze and Boodle Has
Failed to Draw Voters and His Associates and
Backers Are Ready to Leave Him.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 27.â There is a feeling in
the legislative atmosphere to-night that
the Mexican's Senatorial campaign of
bluff and bluster, booze and boodle, is
nearing its end. Burns has been unable
to keep his contracts. He has been in
capable of commanding the powerful
friendships and influences that he boasted
he could control. He has had his day and
his race, and those that have a right to
represent Republican Â©pinions declare
that he Is a Senatorial impossibility,
clinging to an absurd hope that parasitic
followers encourage simply because it is
money in their purses.
These opinions and the conclusion that
Burns cannot win found expression to
night in the return of George A. Knight to
the field as an avowed aspirant for the
United States Senatorship. Knight re
tired from the contest three weeks ago,
packing bag and baggage, returning to
San Francisco. He declared at that time
that he believed there was no show for
him. He is sure now that he was right
then, but is now ouite as sure that con
ditions have changed and that the time is
opportune for a new candidate in the
race.
"I am again a candidate for the United
States Senatorship," he said to-night. "I
am convinced that none of the candi
dates now before the Legislature can
win. They have all had a good day and
a fast track, and none of them can
reach the wire. Some of them are close
personal friends of mine, and I would do
nothing to jeopardize them if I thought
they had the remotest chance of victory.
I am convinced, however, that none ' of
them possesses the necessary strength or
is in a position to obtain it.
"A new candidate, free from the criti
cisms that have been maffe of the aspi
rants now before the Legislature, is a po
litical necessity, and I intend to submit
my name to the Legislature, I have noth
CLARK WILL NOT
DESERT GRANT
SAN JOSE, Feb. 27.â The people at
Mountain View, the home of Assembly
man Walter A. Clark, are aroused for
fear that their representative in the Leg
islature will vote for Dan Burns for
United States Senator. All along Clark
has been a stanch supporter of Grant, and
the young legislator was being praised on
all sides for not rushing to the Mexican's
camp as did Shortridge, Arnerich and Kel
sey of the Santa Clara County delegation.
Now these same constituents fear Clark
will join the Burns forces. Clark was
seen at his home last night by a Call re
porter ancMdenied any such intention.
The story that has caused all this un
easiness runs as follows: On Wednesday
of last week Clark was in Rodgers' general
merchandise store discussing the Sena
torial question, and is reported as saying
Burns would be elected, but not before
the middle of next week. "There is only
one man we can elect." the listeners say
Clark's words were, "and that is Dan
Burns. It is better to elect him than not
to elect anybody. One reason why we
should elect a Senator this time is because
two years hence the Legislature may be
Democratic and the election of Burns
would be better than a good Democrat.
There is only one thing against Burns,
and except that he would be a very safe
man in the United States Senate. I didn t
want to elect him, but fought him all
I could, but now I am convinced it is
better to elect him than nobody." From
this conversation those present inferred
he would flop to Burns. The people in
Clark's district don't want Burns and
they are not pleased with. this prospect
ive change of heart of their representa
tive. Clark is also reported as stating
that if the Governor could appoint Burns
would be the man.
Assemblyman Clark has been confined
to his home with the grip for the past
week, but expects to get back to the cap
ital in a day or so. He was seen last
night at his residence. He denied the
story that he would go to Burns. "As far
as I am concerned, all my efforts have
been for U. S. Grant. He is the best
man for the place, and for that reason I
am in favor of supporting him. As long
as there is a- chance for Grant's election
I will stay with him. I will say this,
however. I am in favor of the Legisla
ture electing a Senator before adjourn
ment I consider It to be to California s
interest that this be done. If it be proven
there is no chance to elect a Senator un
der the system of balloting now going on
I am in favor of a representative Repub
lican caucus. I believe a caucus to-day
would virtually mean Grant's election.
That is where I differ with the majority of
the Grant men. They are all so scared
about going Into a caucus simply because
they think their man won't win. I don t
believe Dan Burns will win the fight."
Clark declined to say whether he would

lican. If that In merit enough I will win.
If it is not, no harm will have been done.
But win or lose, I am convinced that
the time is now critical in the Senatorial
contest, and none of the men now striving
for the honor can win under any circum
stances that can be conceived.
"I have not yet determined whether
to present my name to-morrow morning
or not. The conference that will be held,
to-morrow afternoon is rather of grave
importance, and I may wait until its ses
sion is over. I feel convinced that I can
command at least seven votes to begin
with In my return to the fight."
Knight's return to the Senatorial con
test is a topic to-night of general discus
sion There has been a feeling that the
interjection of a new man into the field
is now an absolute necessity. The leading
candidates hafe ceased to make material
gains, and in fbiling to advance have prac
tically retrograded. Their contest has
dragged its slimy way of scandal and cor
ruption through the Legislature week
after week. The Mexican has failed to
prove his boasted strength and the cor
rupt influences he assumes to control can
not help him.
There Is little more to hope from th*
other candidates, and the political horizon
has been eagerly scanned for a new as
pirant. Whether or not George A. Knight
is the man is necessarily a question of
speculation. He is the first to enter and
to give expression to the sentiment that
is here.
Knight's' renewed candidacy has given
rise to some very free opinions on the
fight Burns has made and the condition
in which the Mexican now finds himself.
If Burns had anything more than bluff
and bluster to show, it Is saio*, ne would
have called on his reserve long ago. If
he "had anything more than booze and
boodle to offer he would have made the
offering long before he became a political
prophet whose only followers are the pa
riahs of politics, thf outcasts that men
shun except under the compulsion of as
sociation.

Committee on State Building:* and
Grounds returned this morninpr from Sal!
â Quentin. where they went to inspect the
prison for the abolishment of which thert;
is a bill before the Legislature. There ia
also a bill to cFeate a State convict hos

Prison. If the prison should be abolfshod
the main portion would go to Folsom, and
it appears to be the consensus of opinion

RESCUED HIS MOTHER
FROM A BURNING HOUSE
Brave Deed of John McGowan Averts
a Fatality at an Early
Morning Fire.
Bridget McGowan, an aged woman, nar
rowly escaped a horrible . death by fire
this morning in her home, 24 Valparaiso
street, a small street running oft Lom

Fire started under the stairway leading
from the kitchen shortly after 1 o'clock
this morning. John McGowan, one of the
family, was awakened by the crackling
of the flames. His first thought was of
his aged, mother, and at the peril of his
own life he rushed upstairs and dragged
her out of bed, down through the suffo
cating smoke and out into the air. A

ENGINEERING THE
CONFERENCE SCHEME
Bnrns' New Manager Thought to Be Priie
Mover of It.
A PLAN TO TRAP LEGISLATORS
Honest Men Fear That the Mexican and Bis Henchmen Will
Use the Meeting to Make Capita! in Spite of the
Opposition.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 27.â A con
ference of Republican legislators to-day clearly demonstra
ted two facts. First, that D. M. Burns cannot be elected to
represent California in the United States Senate without the aid of
a secret caucus, and second that his only chance for a dark-lan
tern caucus lies in the slender opportunity presented by a confer
ence. The sentiment is growing stronger every hour that no Sen
ator wouM be better than the election of Burns. Legislators who
at first hesitated to declare that no choice would be better than the
choice of Burns are outspoken to-night in the declaration that the
State should be saved from the disgrace that the secret caucus
threatens.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 27.â The Republican con
ference this afternoon was attended by
eighty members. The proceedings be
gan in talk and closed in talk. The ad
journed meeting of the conference to
be held to-morrow will not bring to
gether as many legislators as attended
to-day. The followers of Grant suspect
that Hervey Lindley is the prime
mover of the scheme. While they can
not discern the Burns "nigger" in the
woodpile, they are confident that one is
there and will spring out at the ap
pointed time.
The Grant theory of the situation is
this: Burns Is in the last ditch. He
nust do something to make a showine:.
If he cannot get a secret caucus he
must have a conference that may re-
Bult In an effort to obtain a caucus of
some kind. After the preliminaries
have been discussed some one will sub
mit a proposition for a vote in caucus
â without prejudice to any candidate or
conditions for the dropping of any can
didate. On the face the proposition
may be fair, but many of the anti-
Burns men will shy at the suggestion
and leave the conference. The Burns
men will insist that something must be
done to break the deadlock, and may
Bucceed in retaining forty-three mem
bers of the Legislature to listen to
further proposals. "Whatever the out
come of the conference may be. Burns
hopes to get the advantage of being
able to say to the people that forty
three Republicans, or a majority of all
the Republican members of the Leeis
lature, were willing to settle the Sena
torial question, but the minority mem
bers walked out and threatened to ad
journ without an election.
V? a last resort. Burns might be will
ing to accept the Melick proposition for
a caucus requiring sixty-one votes to
name the nominee. On these lines the
caucus might work for several days
without result, and at length a proposi
tion would come to amend the rules of
proceeding to drop the lowest man on
th-> list after a certain number of bal
lots had been taken. Then a walk-out
â might take place if such a rule were
adopted and the touts would roar that
Burns was willing to settle the fight on
proper grounds but his enemies and the
foes of the Republican party opposed
Many clear-headed and loyal Repub
licans who have the welfare of the
party and the good name of the State
In mind oppose every scheme in the
chape of a caucus and simply adhere
to the proposition to settle the contest
Jn joint convention, yet there are many
anti-Burns men who sincerely believe
that a conference may result in the
election of an acceptable and able
Senator. They may be right in their
opinions, but the members of the Leg
islature who are keen enough to see
through the game of Lindley and Dib
ble advise against a conference with
the Burns people.
A conference on the line of assem
bling all the members of the Legisla
ture opposed to the election of Burns
might open the way to the election of
a creditable Senator. Every day the
conviction grows deeper and stronger
that the election of Burns would not
only bring discredit on the State at
home and abroad, but so disrupt the
Republican party that the State would
be lost to Republicanism in the great
campaign of 1900. Better no Senator
for two years than the election of
Burns. Should the Legislature adjourn
without having chosen a Senator the
liepublicans could go before the peo
ple and say with truth and honor,
"Our party refused to take orders from
the machine politicians and the South
ern Pacific Railroad. We were forced
to the choice of Dan Burns or no Sena
tor, and we said no Senator until the
question was submitted again to the
people of California."
This method would give Burns a
chance to obtain his desired vindica
tion. Men favoring his election to the
office of United States Senator could
become candidates for the Legislature,
and if the people wanted him for Sena
tor they could vote for them.
Since Saturday afternoon a deter
mined effort has been made to break
Genera] Barnes' line, but bo far the as-
Faults have failed. The general is in
the fight to the finish, and his friends
are more confident than ever before
that he will win out. From several
quarters he has received assurances of
support. The efforts to break him down
'have reacted in his favor. On all sides
it is conceded that he has made a clean
and honorable contest for the Senator.
and predictions of his ultimate tri
umph are numerous.
All ports of rumors are in circulation
this evening. The medicine mi>n are
expecting relief. One story is to the
pffect that the unusual calm of the past
twenty-four hours will be followed by
the reign of boodle. Another story is
to th<- effect that Van R. Paterson will
be brought forward again with a great
f otirish. Among Democrats the subject
of voting for Estee to break the dead
lock has been discussed. The talk is
based on the belief that Burns cannot
w.n, but will recede from the "rule or
ru!n" policy. Early In the session Dib
b'Â« proclaimed the santJment "Burns or
no Senator," but the touts may be con
vinced after reflection that a Senator
in sympathy with the "colonel" would
be better than no Senator far two years.
It is expected that there will be a
great crowd of people here next
Wednesday. Wonder is expressed that
the leading merchants, bankers and
professional men of San Francisco and
Oakland do not take a deeper interest
in the contest than they have so far
displayed. The main influence of a per
sonal nature exerted here has been
drawn from classes that derive their
support from politics, the race course
and gambling devices. The higher and
better classes cf citizenship t-tuy away
from the Capitol and deplore the degen
eracy of the times. The good and true
men of the Legislature, who are mak
ing a gallant struggle to preserve the
fair name and honor of the State, feel
that they are not receiving the manly
support from good citizens which the
emergency calls for. The fearless pul
pit and the incorruptible press have
sustained the burden of the fight so far,
and yet one more determined assault of
the machine forces and their allies may
be made on the Legislature. The mem
bers who are fighting the battle of the
people here in Sacramento are more
hopeful of victory to-night than ever
before, but they are apprehensive that
boodle may be sent here at the eleventh
hour.
Irving M. Scott Is expected to arrive
here to-morrow. The indications that
there may be a rush of events may call
him to the capital at once.
BARD WITHDRAWS
FROM THE RACE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 27.â Hon. J. T. Richards
of Santa Barbara, who came here last
week with Thomas R. Bard, received a
message by telephone this evening
from San Francisco which may have
an important bearing on the Senatorial
situation. Mr. Bard telephoned that
he was no longer in the field as a can
didate for United States Senator and
desired the friends who were voting
for him to vote for U. S. Grant. He
also expressed the sentiment that no
election of Senator would be better
than the election of Burns.
Assemblyman Greenwell, who recent
ly changed his vote from Grant to
Bard on the advice of his Ventura con
stituents, was advised to-night to
change back to Grant. Senator Rowell
of Fresno, who has been voting for
Thomas R. Bard, has been informed
that his candidate is no longer in the
field.
GOVERNOR GAGE
THINKS BURNS
CAN'T GET IT
Governor Gage was in the city Sun
day and while here had a long conver
sation on the Senatorial situation with
a member of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee. The Governor was
sorely perturbed and could not see any
solution of the contest. He expressed
a realization of the effect the election
of Burns would have on the party and
spoke in a manner which indicated that
he did not believe the man from Mexico
couid be elected. The Governor fore
sees a grave contingency in the affairs
of the party during the next two years.
If Burns should, be elected a violent
protest is sure to follow and if de
feated he may endeavor to completely
wreck the party in this State. After
reviewing the situation the Governor
vaguely intimated that the only possi
ble solution he could see is the with
drawal of all the candidates now In the
field and the selection of some promi
nent Republican not yet named.
The Republican State Central Com
mittee will not indorse the action of its
chairman in transferring the head
quarters from this city to Sacramento.
Several leading members of the com
mittee are very indignant over this
matter and unhesitatingly condemn the
attempt to plunge the committee into
the Senatorial contest.
Fpur years ago the managers of the
Republican party deemed it wise to
maintain permanent headquarters in
San Francisco and the rooms at the
Palace Hotel were retained as a, meet
ing plate for party men when they
were in the city. The experiment
brought 1 forth good results, as demon
strated in the last campaign. Instead
of the organization dissolving after
election it was continued and whon .the
campaign opened no preliminary organ
ization work was necessary. Profiting
by this experience the present commit
tee, though they considered their active
duties ended v.ith tho election, in
structed the chairman to keep the head
quarters open until the next gen r.il
election. There was no intention, how
ever, that the Committee should take
any part in the Senatorial fight, and
when the chairman of the commutes
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALX., TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1899.
transferred the headquarters to the
State capital he did so without consult
ing the other members of the commit
tee. After the move had been made the
chairman endeavored to have his ac
tion indorsed and he met with a de
served rebuke.
He sent an agent to the Individual
members of the Central Committee with
a typewritten document commending
the removal of the State headquarters.
Included in the indorsement which was
presented to the commjtteemen for
their signatures was a clause assuming
the responsibility for the expenses in
curred. Inasmuch as the plan was not
a party affair but rather a scheme in
the interest of one individual the ex
ecutive committee very promptly and
emphatically rejected the whole mat
ter. That their position might not be
misunderstood the committeemen sent
a notice to the chairman that he had
acted on his own responsibility and
therefore he would be compelled to foot
the bills. This notice was sent by the
auditing committee of the executive
committee, which is composed of Wen
dell Easton, P. N. Lilienthal, Paris Kil
burn, E. Nusbaumer and E. C. Hart of
Sacramento. ,
TO DRAIN THE SOUTHWEST.
Mission Clubs Concentrate on a Sys
tem of Sewerage for the
District.
Property owners in the southwestern
section of the Mission are determined to
have a system of sewerage adopted by
the present Board of Supervisors. At a
recent meeting of the Federation of Mis
sion Improvement Clubs a petition was
prepared and ordered filed with the Su
pervisors, askirfe that the City Engineer
be empowered to prepare plans for a
sewer system and pledging the board to
provide funds in the next tax levy to in
augurate the work.
The object is to prepare the necessary
plan, with estimates of cost for the main
outlet that is to start from Ocean View
and tan Sunnyside, Lakeview. Fairmount,
Holly Park and empty into the bay near
Butchertown.
Following on this line of improvement,
the federation went further, and in
structed the executive committee to pre
pare a petition for an appropriation for
the erection of new schools in the West
of Castro Street District, the Sunnyside
District, Ocean View and the Five Mile
Trait. It will be circulated for signa
tures and later filed with the Board of
Supervisors.
The hoggish propensity of the telephone
company in charging 25 cents for all mes-
Bages from Ocean view got an unmerci
ful scoring at the hands of the delegates
from that club. It was resolved to re
quest the company to extend the nickel
service to the place. Delegate A. S. Lille,
with an object of aiding nome products,
offered a resolution to that effect which
was unanimously carried and sister clubs
requested to follow suit.
EXAMINATION FOR PROMOTION.
General Shafter Appoints a Board to
Examine Enlisted Men of the
Regular Army.
General Shafter yesterday issued an or
der in pursuance with instructions re
ceived from the Secretary of War, ap
pointing a board of officers to meet at
the Presidio at 11 o'clock on March 20, to
conduct the examination of such enlisted
men of the regular army, serving in this
department, as may be legally qualified
and desire to compete in the examination
for i romotion to the grade of second lieu
tenant.
AM applicants for examination will be
sent by their respective commanding of
ficers in time to enable them to report
in person for examination to the presi
dent of the board, on the morning of the
20th proximo. Upon conclusion of their
examination, and when their presence is
no longer required by the board, they will

surgeon general.
Captain Henry C. Danes, Third Artil
lery.
Captain Isaac P. Ware, assistant sur
geon.

SHOULD BE ASSESSED HERE. ]
City and County Attorney Lane Sub
mits an Opinion Regarding San
Mateo Railway Company.
In response to 'the question, asked by
the Board of Supervisors, as to whether
the San Francisco and San Mateo Rail
way Company should not be assessed by
the Assessor of this city and county in
stead of as now by the State Board of
Equalization City and County Attorney
Lane submits his answer. He advises
that the property of the company in San
Francisco should be assessed here, and
not by the State Board of Equalization.
Mr. Lane's opinion is an extended one.
It reviews the history of the franchise,
draws a distinction between commercial
railroads and street railroads and cites
numerous decisions bearing upon the sub
ject. He does not place himself above
the courts, however, as he concludes with:
"I cannot, however, state that this is un
questionably the law. because a matter
of construction is merely the opinion of
the body or person called upon to inter
pret, and what may be the opinion of the
courts, I cannot foretell."
SANTA CLARAS WON AGAIN.
The Collegians Defeated the Impe
rials of This City Sunday.
The Santa Clara College team scored its
sixth victory of the season Sunday after
rfoon when it defeated the Imperials of
San Francisco by a score of 18 to 5. The
first four innings were well played and
productive of considerable excitement.
The explosion came in the fifth inning,
when by clever bunching of their hits
tho collegians scored 8 runs, forcing
Burekoff to retire from the box. Henry
King of the Friscos occupied the slab
during the rest of the game and suc
ceeded, to some extent, in keeping down
the score of the college team. The bat
ting was heavy on both sides, but the
sharp fielding of the college boys prevent
ed their opponents from scoring often.
The batting of King and the infield work
of the collegians were the features of the
game. Jay Hughes, the great Baltimore
twirler, who was acting as coach for the
college team, was well satisfied with the
showing made by his colts.
Pacific Cable Bill.
Several weeks ago the members of the
local Chamber of Commerce telegraphed
to the Pacific Coast representatives in
Washington asking them to have inserted
in the Pacific cable bill a clause to the
effect that the proposed cable should be
constructed of material of American man
ufacture. Yesterday's press dispatches
giving an account of the provisions of the
bill failed to mention the wished for
clause. In order to make the request. or
demand more forcible, the Chamber yes
terday sent the following dispatches to
the Chambers of Commerce of Sacra.Taen
to, !-'>s Angeles, Seattle, Portland and
Tacoma: "We have wired our delegation
in congress urging the insertion of a pro
viso in any Pacific cable bill that the ca
ble be manufactured in the United States
by American manufacturers. We respect
fully ask similar action immediately by
your organization."

. Continuance.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S DESIRE
SAID HE WAS NOT PREPARED
TO PROCEED.
Â« .
Friends of the Senator Declare. the
Postponement Is Unjust, and
That It Will Elect Their
Man.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HARRISBURG, Pa., Feb. 27.â The
continuance of the trial of Senator
Quay created a sensation among the
legislators and politicians at Harris
burg. Captain James Clark, who is
in charge at the Quay headquarters,
says it is an outrage. He claims Senator
Quay was ready and anxious to go ahead
with the trial, and* that his friends
had every assurance that he would be
honorably acquitted. Senator Mere
dith, a strong Quay man, says the de
lay means the election of Senator Quay
this week. Senator McCarrell, an
other Quayite, is certain his jury bill
will become a law before the time
fixed for the trial.
Captain William Hasson, one of the
Democratic House leaders, is confident
District Attorney Rothermel had good
reason to ask that the case go over,
and said the continuance would have
no effect on the Senatorial deadlock,
except to prolong it until after the
trial. This seems to be the general
opinion of the faction opposed to Sena
tor Quay. E. S. Vankelkenberg, the
leader of the anti-Quay forces, says
the postponement was a great sur
prise.
PHILADELPHIA. Feb. 27.â 0n mo
tion of District Attorney Rothermel,
the Quay conspiracy trial has been
continued until April 10. The District
Attorney did not state his reason for
this action. Though interest in the
trial was intense throughout the city,
there was no crowding in the court, be
cause of an order issued that only the
lawyers directly interested in the case,
the panel of witnesses and a limited
number of newspaper men should be
admitted.
Senotor Quay and his son entered
the court room accompanied by their
counsel, Rufus E. Shapeley, A. S. L.
Shields and David T. Watson of Pitts
burg. The presence of the latter was
a surprise to those in attendance, as it
was generally understood he had re
tired from the case.
District Attorney Rothermel and his
associates held a brief consultation, at
the conclusion of which the District At
torney arose and, addressing the court,
said that for reasons which he did not
care to state at present he desired that
the trial of Mr. Quay be continued. He
was not ready to nroceed with the trial
now. He stated that as the Judges of
the court would be engaged for the
greater part of the present month in
hearing the liquor license applications,
he would ask that the date for this trial
be fixed for April 10.
Mr. Shapeley of counsel for the de
fense opposed the motion. He said
their witnesses had been subpenaed and
every preparation made to bring the
trial to an immediate conclusion. A
continuance at this time, he said, would
cause great inconvenience and be un
fair to^his clients.
Judpe Reitler announced that he
would grant the motion, inasmuch as
the District Attorney was not prepared
to proceed, and named April 10 as the
date for the trial.
Senator Quay, on leaving the court
room expressed his disappointment at
the unexpected deferring of the trial.
He declined to discuss the matter fur
ther simply adding that he was ex
tremely anxious to have the case dis
posed of, and that he had hoped that it
would have been taken up to-day and
quickly brought to a conclusion.
HIBERNIANS HOLD A

The annual meeting of the county board
of directors of the Ancient Order of Hi

street last night. Representatives from
all the divisions in the city were present,
'â  and the meeting was presided over by P.

divisions were Inspected by a committee
on legislation and such amendments made
as were necessary to conform to the new

'â  of the order recently held in this city.
A letter from the Knights of the Red
Branch notlfymg the Hibernians that the
former order would celebrate the birth
day of Robert Emmet, which occurs on
next Saturday evening, was read. Gov

wl he made by Mayor Phelan. Thepro
eeeds derived from the celebration will be
turned into the fund for the erection of

<=ienifving their desire to co-operate with
the Knights of the Red Branch in the
celebration, and circular letters will be
sent to all the members of the Ancient
Order of Hibernians urging them to attend
the celebration.
It was decided to hold a picnic of the

WARD IN CUSTODY.
He Is Booked on Five Charges of
Felony Embezzlement.
Bernard .Ward, financial secretary of
the Marine Firemen's Association, was
arrested last night by Detective Cody
and booked on five charges of felony em
bezzlement. Several, days ago John
Dougherty, the treasurer of the associa
tion, was arrested for the alleged theft
of $17,000 of the ' funds "of the organiza
tion. After being locked up in the .City
Prison Dougherty declared he had not
stolen a cent and that Ward was the real
culprit. Acting on his statement Andrew
Pryal the present treasurer of the asso
ciation, visited' police headquarters and
swore to five complaints charging Ward
with felony embezzlement. He â¢. alleges
that on March 5, 1897. Ward drew out of
the Hlbernia Bank $3000 belonging to the
association. On March 1, ISOT.he drew out
of the San Francisco Savings Society
$3000,. also a part of the funds of the or
ganization. A , few days later, it is
claimed, he visited the:Germania Savings
and , Loan Society, where the association
bad considerable money. Â«a 4Â«poilt. and
drew out $4000, representing that he had
been instructed to do so by the president
of the association. On July 9, 1897, it Is
claimed, he again drew on the Germania
Savings and Loan Society to the extent
of $2772 28. The same day he went to the
San" Francisco Savings Union, where the
association also had money on deposit,
and drew out $2700. It is claimed that he
was not authorized to draw the amounts,
hence his arrest.
Ward denies his guilt and claims he will
be able to establish his innocence at his
preliminary examination.

ANTI-PHELAN POPULISTS.
Middle of the Roaders Will Reorgan
ize on Old Lines.
â¢ The middle-of-the-road Populists, hav
ing had enough of fusion with the Demo
crats, have decided to purge their party
and maintain a separate organization.
Underneath the turmoil now existing in
the single-taxers and anti-monopolists is
a current of bitter resentment against
the methods pursued by the Populist
managers during the last campaign. One
of the foremost middle-of-the-roaders de
clares that the battle now on is between i
the Phelan faction and straight-out
Populists. Phelan Populism prevailed
last fall and the party gained nothing.
Now such men. as Taylor . Rogers, . Dr.
Walton Grlswold and George Monteith
are striving to rescue the organization
and blot out the hybrid stigma which at
taches to it.
Last evening a secret meeting of a
committee appointed to devise methods to
reorganize was held at Dr. Griswold's
office, 106 Eddy street. The first thing to
be done is to get rid of A. B. Kinne and
G. D. Gillespie, who are charged with be
traying the Populists. Kinne and Gilles
pie will fight to retain control of the cam
paign committee and its emoluments.
The other side threatens civil and
criminal proceedings against these men,
and before the friction is settled a few
political secrets may be disclosed.
Kinne and Gillespie have held the whip
up to the present, but it now looks as if
they would be thrown from the box and
the Populist coach tooted by Jehus who
will not turn out for either a Southern
Pacific locomotive or one of Phelan's pav
ing machines.
Several futile attempts have been made
to obtain an accounting' from the men
who handled the Populist funds, but the
statements made are most unsatisfactory
to the rank and file. Further efforts are
to be made to secure a complete state
ment for investigation. Some of the Popu
list committee openly charge that the
party was debauched by men employed by
Phelan, and, further, that money al
leged to have been spent for the ticket
never left the hands of the men who han
dled the funds.

THE WILLEY WILL.
Louisa M. Muirhead Files Her
Answer in the Contest.
Answer was filed yesterday by Louisa
M. Muirhead to the contest instigated by
M. K. Springer. R. Springer, Abbie W.
Bridgham and Sarah C. Scharrer against
the will of the late Charles .Walter Wil
ley. It is averred by the contestants, who
are uncles and aunts of the deceased,
that Willey was not mentally competent
and that undue influence was used to
influence him to sign the testament giv
ing his entire estate to the respondent,
Mrs. Muirhead.
To these allegations Mrs. Muirhead en
ters a general denial and cites proofs by
which to substantiate her contentions.
Shortly after the death of his father Wil
ley was picked . up by Mrs. Muirhead
while he was begging on the street. As
subsequent decisions proved this young
man was entitled to some $80,000 of his
father's estate, but no relatives came to
his aid, Mrs. Muirhead gave him a home
with her. After a time she was paid a lit
tle for his support, but for many months
past she says that she has received noth
ing.
When Willey went to live in Mrs. Muir
head's home he was in poor health. Sub
sequently he recovered and was employed
in a well known lawyer's office. It was
while he was employed in this office, at
tending to his various duties, and the
lawyer says in possession of all his fac
ulties, that he drew the will in favor or"
the woman, who, with her husband, had
befriended him. He never spoke of rela
tives, Mrs. Muirhead says, and she knows
that while he was in her home they never
aided him. Consequently the proponent
Js. prepared to defend her rights against
the claims of the dead man's relatives.

ACCUSES HER SISTER.
Ida A. Tripp Says She Is Being Dis
criminated Against.
Ida A. Tripp filed suit yesterday against
her sister, Carrie L. Dick, for an allow
' ance of $200 a month from the trust estate
of Emma L. Cowie, of which the litigants
are heirs and legatees. The trust estate
is at present valued at $261,000. The de
fendant and Wallace M. Cowie are the
i trustees and under the terms of the will
: the plaintiff was to receive a certain al
! lowance from the residue of the profits
of the estate. The plaintiff alleges that
her sister has discriminated against her
and for some time only allowed her $10 a
month and the use of a house, but later
gave her $40 a month. Mrs. Tripp avers
1 that her husband is unable through ill
ness to work and asks that the court al
low her $200 a month for permanent sup
port. _
PASSED A BOGUS ORDER.
More of Peter McGlade's Peculiar
Methods Coming to Light.
William McGee, who gave his occupa
tion as that of a clerk, was arrested last
night by Detective Tom Gibson and
charged with obtaining money by false
pretenses. During the administration of
Pete McGlade, the disgraced ex-book
keeper in the Superintendent of Streets'
office, McGee. it is claimed, presented a
worthless order on M. Regensburger, the
broker for $200. As the order was signed
by McGlade. the broker handed over the
amount to McGee. Since then Regens
burger learned that the order was worth
less and he at once swore out a war
rant charging McGee with obtaining
money by false pretenses.

SANTA ROSA. Feb. 2T.â The body of
Peter Besente, otherwise known as "Lit

Calder's Grove, near Sebastopol, was- laid
to rest in the Sebastopol Cemetery yes

Besente was hardly 20 years of age. The
killing occurred as the result of a quar

James Stevens engaged while drunk. Pe

Indians, witnessed the quarrel, and they
say that Stevens first attacked Besente
with a fence picket, and that after beat

A post-mortem examination held at be

SANTA ROSA ORDINANCE
IS DECLARED INVALID
Outside Merchants May Place Bank-
nipt Stocks on Sale in
That City.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 26.â Judge Dough
erty in Department No. 2 of the Superior
Court to-day handed down a decision in
the case of J. Hirshberg vs. the City of
Santa Rosa, which invalidates ordinance
159, regulating the sale of goods, wares
and merchandise. By the ruling of the
court the law which has heretofore pre
vented outside merchants coming here
and disposing of bankrupt stocks with
out paving a heavy license is declared
invalid.
The suit grew out of the action of J.
Hirshberg, a San Francisco clothing man
who a few weeks ago opened up a bank
rupt stock in a store on Laurett street
under the name of the St. Louis Cloth
ing Company. The sale was extensively
advertised and upon the day announced
the doors of the new establishment were
thrown open to the public. One of the
first persons to enter was Deputy City
Marshal W. B. Griggs, who demanded
that Hirshberg comply with the law in
the matter of taking out a license for
$100, as provided by the ordinance men
tioned. Hirshberg refused to do so and
the store was closed. Suit was brought
to test the ordinance.
In the decision the plaintiff is granted
a permanent injunction against City Mar
shal Charles H. Holmes, restricting him
from further interfering with plaintiff in
the conduct of his business.

INCREASED TROOPS AND
HEAVY APPROPRIATIONS
SENATE PUSSES
THE ARMY BILL
Amendment of Compro

GORMAN GAINS A VICTORY
TIME LIMIT ON INCREASE OF
REGULAR TROOPS.
Whita, Vest and Others Speak
Against the Bill, but It Is Dis

55 to 13.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â After a con
test that will be memorable in the his
tory of the Senate, the compromise
army reorganization bill was passed
this evening at 7:10 o'clock. When
the Senate convened at 11 o'clock this
. morning it seemed more than likely
that the bill might be passed during
the day. Gorman of Maryland insist
ed that his amendment providing that
the army should not be increased per
manently, or beyond January 1, 1901,
be incorporated in the measure. For
several hours it appeared probable
that his insistence at least would
throw the bill over until to-morrow,
and perhaps defeat it. An agreement
was reported finally, however, and
Gorman's amendment, in a slightly
modified form, was accepted.
The notable speech of the day
against the measure was delivered by
Vest of Missouri, but his brilliant elo
quence availed nothing against the
measure as finally agreed upon.
To-night the Senate took up the
sundry civil bill and completed its
reading, all the committee amend
ments being agreed to except those re
lating to the District of Columbia.
The bill was then laid aside, to be com
pleted to-morrow.
When debate on the bill was resumed
Bate of Tennessee, a member of the Mili
tary Affairs Committee, addressed the
Senate in opposition to an Increase of the
army and against warfare on the Filipl
noa. lie regarded the measure as proba
bly the most important of the present ses
sion. He objected to the bill because it
provided twice a^ many men as the exi
gencies of the situation required; because
it made distinctions between regulars and
volunteers against the latter; and because
it was an entering wedge which makes U3
depend on the regular army instead of on
the consent of the people thynselvea If
we were compelled to right for control in
the Philippines we ought to charge the
cost against the $20,000,u00 said to be due
Spain. L'ntil the President indicated to
Congress his policy and purposes no addi
tional troops should be granted him.
Kenney (D.) offered amendments to
the pending bill providing for the creation
of a veterinary corps to consist of a chief
veterinary officer, with rank, pay and al
lowances of a colonel; ten veterinarians,
each vith the rank, pay and allowance
of a fir .t lieutenant of cavalry, and twen
ty vet. .Vinarians, each with the rank, pay
and a'Jjwances of a second lieutenant of
eaval:*. Vest antagonized the bill, al
though? he said he did so with hesitation
becai'")e of its strong advocacy by his col
league, Cockrell. He declared his belief
that -i he war in the Philippines was not
being conducted with the idea of giving
the I'ilipinos self-government.
"I relieve," he said, "that this Govern
ment "ts to take the Philippines as an in
demnity. It has so been stated in the
imperialistic press. But I ask now wheth
er ii' is true that the President tele
grap-ied to our commissioners to take
noth'iig less than the island of Luzon, as
Portr Rico was worth only $40,000,fX)0 and
woulfl not be a proper indemnity for the
war. I ask now whether such a dispatch
was 'sent."

Vestâ Was no dispatch to that effect

Fryeâ Not to that effect.
Vestâ Was there not a dispatch sent
that nothing less than the island of Luzon
would be accepted?
Fryeâ The instructions of the President
when we started out were to take Luzon.
Vestâ Was there not a dispatch tnat
Porto Rico was worth only $4U,000,000, and
that, we must have LUzon for an indem
nity for the war?
p rye _Xot a thing of the kind.
Yest â Was no mention made of Porto
Rico not being a sufficient indemnity for
FryeâNot at all. The Senator has
heard read in executive session every tele
gram cable and letter of instruction that
passed between the President and the
Peace Commissioners.
Vestâ The statement I nave made was
published in the Imperialistic press of the
country and it has never been contra
dicted until the Senator (Frye) contra
dicts it now.
â¢â¢For the purposes of my argument,
continued Vest. "I content myself with
the statement that we were to take noth
ing less than the island of Luzon. If that
be true, how is it that the President said
In his Boston speech that this contin

â So " continued Vest, "it is with the
President. He places a hand on the shoul
der of the Filipino and says, 'I am :\
toiler and a moiler and I intend to save
you in spite of yourself.' And he wants
100,000 missionaries with rifles to shoot
his good resolutions into them."
He said that all those who were opposed
to the plans of the administration were
denominated traitors, but he repudiated
the charge with scorn. "If spoken," he
said "it is a slander: if written a libel."
White of California spoke against the
bill and against the present policy in the
Philippines. To-day he said the guns of
the Filipinos were pointed against us and
our guns were pointed against them. The
President recognized, he said, . the seri
ousness of the situation, as all thoughtful
persons did. It seemed that the Filipinos
had been, saved from Spain only to bo
turned over to another master. The prin
cipal ground of. their resentment was that
no policy had been outlined to them; an
assurance given them of fair and just
treatment.
White said he could not contemplate the
situation In the Philippines with any other
feeling than that of shame. There was no
possibility of assimilating the Filipinos.
The outlook was very gloomy. He advo
cated the freedom of the people of both
<"Ã¼ba and the Philippines. He agreed
with Seweil that war was likely with
Cuba. "Why. If we were to give the Cu
bans their freedom, were our armed sol
diers anchored on that Island? How vain
and visionary, the theories of men when
behind it all is the grim specter of lucre/
he exclaimed Even this great republic
might reverse itself. He had felt from
the beginning that the country was on
the verge of ruin, and he found in the
pages of history justification for this ap
prehension. We claim, said he, to be a
Christian, civilized and progressive peo
ple, but are we in earnest? Are we not
about to discard, the emblems of peace
and enter upon air era of contest? War
may come, but if it does it must be for
freedom, to defend i liberty and not a war
for conquest if it is to receive my vote."
An amendment by Thurston striking out
the paragraph relating to the age limit
for the appointment of officer* in the pro
visional regiments w.as agreed to. ;
Hawley offered as aji amendment a pro
vision in the flfteeniUi section authoriz
ing the President to tmlist temporarily in |
the service for absolutely necessary pur- !
poses in the Philippines, volunteers, of
ficers and men, â¢lndividually or by organ
izations, now in those' islands and about |
to be discharged; and directing tjaat they
shall be counted as pa.rt of the volunteer |
force authorized by this act, and that
they shall not be enlistjed for more than
six months nor beyond tine time necessary
to replace them. It was adopted.
Gorman offered the fiollowing amend
ment as a provision of section 15: "That
each and every provision, of this act shall
continue in fiorce until July 1, 1901. and
on and after that date all the general
staff and line officers appointed to the
army under tbJs act sha.ll be discharged
and the numbers restored in each grade
to those existing at the passage of this
act and the enlisted force of the line of
the army shall be reduced to the number
as provided for by law prior to April 1, ,
1898, exclusive of such additions as have
been or may be made under this act to the
.artillery, and except the cadets provided
for by this act, who may be appointed
prior to July 1, 1;X)1; ami provided, fur
ther, thai no officer who has been or may
be promoted under existing law or un
der the rules of seniority shall be dis
turbed in his rank.-' 1
Warren, a member of the Military Af
fairs Committee, opposed the amendment
and could see no reason for its adoption.
The bill, he said, had been pronounced by
Cockrell as a good lull 'before God and
man.. He agreed with thai statement, but
said the adoption or â¢ the amendment
would make it a bad bill.
The amendment was adoptedâ 6B voting"
in the affirmative and none in the nega
tive. Warren was paired .against it.
Bacon of Georgia said the adoption of
the Gorman amendment simplified the sit- !
uation materially. This bfjl would place '
an annual expenditure of $.55,000,000 upon
the country, but notwithstanding the fact
that the war In the Philippines was an
unholy war, he felt it his duly to support
the bill.
An amendment offered by Carter pro- ;
vided that three of the provisional |
regiments, at the discretion or the Pres
ident, should be cavalry. -chose members
should be particularly proficient in horse- i
manship and marksmanship, the regi
ments to serve mounted or dismounted. j
It was agreed to.
In the course of a speech against the
general features of the bill Allen of Ne
braska made the statement that he had
received many letters from the volun
teers in Manila, protesting against being
used to shoot down thoso whom they had
regarded as their friends. Those men, he
maintained, ought to be recalled.
Hoar announced his intention not to
support the bill. It was not a bill for
supplies, nor was it a bill for the com
plete reorganization of the army. It was
then merely a bill to provide an army to â¢
make war upon the people of the Philip- !
pines. With the exchange of ratifications
of the peace treaty the war would then
be at an end. It would be necessary to
determine whether there was to be a civil
war.
.Fettigrew also announced his intention
to vote against the bill, saying there was
army enough now, and that with the re
turn of peace there could be no need for
a greater army. He saw no reason for the '
increase except to coerce the people of
the Philippines and deprive them of their
liberty. He predicted that the effort to
destroy the liberty and the lives of the
Filipinos would prove the blackest chap- .
ter in the history of the United States.
He had voted to support the President at
the beginning of the war. but the Presi
dent was no longer entitled to his confi- '
dence. "I believe it tbe duty of Con
gress " he said, "to remain In session, if
necessary,, indefinitely to prevent the ex
ecutive from pursuing a course toward
these people that forever will blacken the
name of this great republic."
The bill was then, at 7 o clock, put on its
passage, and was passed, 5, to 13, the vote ;
in detail being as follows: .
Ayesâ Allison, Bacon. Burrows.

conclusion of the reading of the bill, at j
9-30 p. m., nearly all committee amend- i
ments having been agreed to, the bill was
laid aside. It was decided that the Sen- ;
ate should convene at 11 clock to-mor

AGAINST HOLDING
THE PHILIPPINES
Caucus of House Democrats
Strongly Opposed to Ex
pansion.
NEW YORK. Feb. 27.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: With only one dissenting vote, that of Burke of
Texas, the caucus of Democrats to-night declared against the re
tention of the Philippine Islands. There was a large attendance of
Democrats, but only two from New York, Driggs and Bradley.
Representative Clark of Missouri offered this preamble, which has been
drawn by Democratic members of the House Committee on Foreign Af
fairs:
We hold that the constitution of the United States as ordained and estab
lished for an intelligent, liberty-loving, self-governing people cannot be suc
cessfully applied to people of different virtues and conditions. We there
fore hold that a colonial policy Is contrary to the theory of our govern
ment and contrary to those principles of civil liberty which we have been
taught to cherish. We believe, with the declaration of independence, that
all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,
and we are unalterably opposed to the establishment of any government by
the United States without the consent of the people to be governed. And in
conformity with these principles, we instruct the minority members of the
Foreign Affairs Committee to introduce and urge the following resolution:
Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the United States hereby dis
claim any disposition or intention to exercise permanent sovereignty, juris
diction or control over the Philippine Islands, and assert their determina
tion when an independent government shall have been established therein to
transfer to said government upon terms which shall be reasonable and just
all rights secured under the cession by Spain, and thereupon leave the gov
ernment and control of the islands to their people.
Major General Wheeler went into caucus long enough to make a
spirited and vigorous speech in opposition to arraying the Democratic
party against the policy of accepting the fruits of the war and its re
sponsibilites. He warned the caucus of disasters that would probably
overtake the Democratic party If it pursued this policy.
General Wheeler had a chilly reception and was repeatedly inter
rupted, and he was taken to task by Rhea of Kansas for preferring a
party policy to principle.
Lewis of Washington made a qualified speech in opposition to the
resolution, but declared he would be bound by the action of the caucus.
Griggs of Georgia offered this resolution, which was agreed to with
o out opposition:
q We, the Democratic members of the House of Representatives In caucus
<Â§, assembled, commend the signal loyalty and valor of our soldiers and sailors
O In the performance of every military duty to which they have been as-
signed by proper authority, however much we deplore the policy of the ad
Â£ ministration now directing their movement, and wÂ© pledge our hearty sup-
O port and sympathy wherever engaged.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28. 1899.
APPROPRIATION
BILLS PASSED
House Provides for Army
and Fortifications.
PAY FOR TROOPS ABROAD
DISCUSSION OF THE PHILIPPINE
POLICY RENEWED.
Grosvenor Replies to the Charge That
There Had Been an Alliance Be
tween Uncle Sam and
Insurgents.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The House
was in session seven hours to-day, and
sent to the Senate two more appropria
tion bills, the army, which had been
under consideration for several days,
and the fortifications. The former
carried about $79,000,000 and the latter
approximately $4,700,000. The final con
ference report upon the Indian appro
priation bill was also adopted. The only
amendment of importance attached to
the army bill was to give two months'
extra pay to enlisted men in the regular
army who served beyond the limits of
the United States during the war with
Spain, and one month's extra pay to
those who served in the United States.
The discussion of the administration's
policy relative to- the Philippines, which
has been occupying the attention of the
members to the exclusion of almost
everything else during the consideration
of appropriation bills for the last two
weeks, was continued to-day, several
speeches being made on the subject.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri, the leading
Democrat on the Appropriations Com
mittee, asserted that appropriations for
this Congress would reach $1,600,000,000.
When consideration of tho army apro
priatlon bill was resumed Cox (V.) of ien
nessee made a short, sharp, general
speech, saying: "1 will never vote a cent
to put a bullet into a gun to shoot down |
those people over there (tho Filipinos), ,
who are trying to establish their home |
government." He could not understand,
ho said, why we had started out to freo
the Cubans and should end by shooting
the Filipinos. What a remarkable notifi
cation, he declared, was that of General
Otis, that we had killed and wounded 40oJ
of those people, part of them naked na
tives, armed with bows and arrow*. As
an American, he asked, where was the
glory of this achievement? 'Who had de
clared war on these people who had done
us r.o harm?
Sulzer (D.) of New \ork offered an
amendment to increase the number of
major generals to four, and to provide for
tilling the vacancies by the appointment
of General Wheeler.
Hull raised a point of order against the
amendment and the point was sustained
by the chair.
Fitzgerald (D.) of Massachusetts offered
an amendment to pay all soldiers in the
regular army who served during the war
beyond the limits of the United States two
months' extra pay upon their muster out,
and who served within the limits of tho
United States one month's extra pay. A
similar provision, he said, applied to vol
unteer troops, and he saw no reason why
;- distinction should be made. The amend
ment was adopted.
This was the last amendment. The
committee rose and the bill as amended
was passed.
Hager (R.) of lowa asked unanimous
consent for the consideration of the Sen- !
ate joint resolution authorizing the Pres*- j
ident to appoint Osman Deignan, one of |
the heroes of the Merrlmac, a naval ca
det at Annapolis.
Underwood of Alabama said he had no
desire to object, but he desired to call at
tention to the fact that each hero of the
Merrimac had received his reward for the
daring display in the heroic exploit at
Santiago harbor save the man who took
the ship in â Lieutenant Hobson. A bill
was now sleeping In the committee to
transfer to the line and promote him. He
thought it unjust that it was not acted
upon. The resolution was adopted.
Henderson of lowa then presented the
special order agreed upon by the Commit
tee on Rules setting a.Â«ide to-morrow until
6 o'clock for the consideration of public
building bills, those acted on by the com
mlttee of the whole to be first considered,
after which such as might be designated
by the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds. Those reported from the com
mittee of the whole were to be considered
in this order: First, those in cities where
there were postofllces of the first clas9;
second, where there were Federal courts.
Dockery opposed the rule on the ground
that neither the condition of the appro
priation bill nor the treasury would war
rant the use of to-morrow for this pur
pose and the appropriation of money
which would result. He figured out_ total
appropriations for the session of $6(5,000,
-000. This did not Include the $115,000,000
for the Nicaragua canal which might be
come law, nor the $25,000-,000 of claims
which we had assumed by tfce treaty of
Paris. These aggregated the appalling
total of $800,000,000. Yet it was now pro
posed to give a day for public buildings
and add $11,000,000 to these staggering lia
bilities. He figured out that the total ap
priation for this Congress would reach
$1,000,000.
The rule was adopted, 97 to 34.
A bill was passed appropriating $5000 for
the investigation of leprosy in the coun
try by a board to be selected by the
surgeon general. Corliss (R.) of Michi
gan stated that there were about 300 cases
in the United States.
Hemtnway (R.) of Indiana then called
up a substitute for the fortifications ap
propriation bill and moved its passage un
der suspension of the rules. Heminwa-y
explained that the substitute was in reali
ty the bill reported from the Appropria
tions Committee with a few minor
amendments. It was necessary to offer
the amended bill as a substitute, as no
amendments were in order under suspen
sion of the rules.
Henry (R.) of Indiana submitted some
general remarks, arraigning ."is col
league, Johnson, "for his unjustifiable
abuse of our groat President." He spoke
of the "Johnsonaldos and Aguinaldos
who were attacking the President.
Cockran (D.) of Missouri declared that
the country would never cease to regrot
the administration's policy toward the
Philippines. The war against the horde
of semi-barbarians thundering at the
gates of Manila would never cease. Our
heroic soldiers sent there were doomed.
Disease and death would ravage our
army during the rainy season.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio delivered a thir
ty-minute speech, generally replying to
the charges emanating from the opposi
tion during the past few days that there
had been an alliance between the Lmltf-d
States and the insurgent forces in the
Philippines. He carefully went over the
official records to show that there never
had been an alliance. The official docu
ments and their dates were produced in
each case. He defied the other side to
produce a single official utterance author
izing or recognizing any alliances. .
In reply to interrogations, Grosvenor
said he spoke on hi 3 own authority.
After some discussion the fortifications
appropriation bill wns passed. The con
ference report upon thn Tndian appropria
tion bill was adopted without division.
The death of Representative Hurley of
New York, who died at Hot Springs. Va.,
yesterday, was announced by his col
league, Fisher. As a mark of respect, the
House at 6 o'clock adjourned.
FILIBUSTERS DEPART
. FROM KANSAS CITY
There Is an Uncertainty as to
Whether They Are Going to
Guatemala or Honduras.
KANSAS CITY, Feb. 27.â The first de
tachment of the filibustering expedition
organized horo for an invasion of Central
America left Kansas City at 10:20 o'clock
to-night. The soldiers of fortune num

four special coaches which were attached
to the regular southbound passenger
train, on the Kansas City, Fort Scott and
Memphis road. William G. Thompson,
former captain of Company D, Fifth Mis
souri Volunteers, was In command.
It is now known beyond question that
the men composing this expedition ex
ppct to see fighting in Central America.
Reports as to their destination are con
flicting, both Guatemala and Honduras
having been mentioned, but men who are
leaders in the adventure have secretly
informed th-Mr friends that the real des
tination is Nicaragua.
District Attorney Warner and United
States Marshal Durham investigated the
affair, but when the band started south
to-night both declared that they had dis
covered nothing to warrant the arrest of
the alleged Invaders. They have advised
the Washington authorities fully.
Dr. R. E. Heath, Consul here for Hon
duras, has also notified his Government
and the Honduran Consul at New Or
leans of the movement.

WALLA WALLA. Wash., Feb. 27.â
News of a desperate battle between of
ficers and a desperado named William
Nackie, on Pine Creek, near Milton, Or.,
on Sunday, was received here by tele
phone to-night. Nackie was released
from the penitentiary here about three
months ago and went to work for a Ger

NEW PHASE IN
CANAL QUESTION
Burton's Substitute for
Senate Amendment.
GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION
PROVIDES FOR BOARD TO STJR
VEY BOTH ROUTES.
Proposition to Examine Panama and
Nicaragua Sites for Water
ways Before Taking
Action.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The meet
ing of the River and Harbor Commit
tee to-day developed a new phase of
the interoceanic canal question. Chair
man Burton took the lead in favoring
full governmental Investigation, both of
the Panama and the Nicaragua routes,
before committing the Government,
and after the meeting Burton expressed
the view that the sentiment of the com
mittee "was opposed to the Senate Nica
ragua amendment and favored full in
vestigation. To that end he introduced
in the House a bill to be proposed later
as a substitute for the Senate Nica
raguan canal amendment. Its main
features are as follows:
The Government of the United States
declares its purpose to secure at the earli
est practical date the construction of a
canal connecting thf> Atlantic and the Pa
i-iiic oceans. A board of seven engineers
shall be appointed by the President to
make the surveys and examinations nec
essary to ascertain the most desirable and
practicable route for such canal and for
the performance of such other duties as
the President may direct; three from the
Corps of Engineers of the army, two en
gineers of the navy and two from civil
life.
The board shall investigate the proposed
routes for a canal between the said
oceans, giving special and personal at
tention to the proposed canal in Nicara
gua and Panama routes, and shall com
plete estimates of the probable cost of
constructing such canal or canals. They
shall also report upon the commercial and
military value to the people of the United
States of such canal route or routes.
The President may enter into negotia
tions with the respective nations owning
the territory through which such canal or
canals may be constructed in order to ob
tain the necessary land for the construc
tion of a suitable canal and to acquire
such rights in natural waterways as may
be necessary. He is also required to en
ter into such negotiations as he may
deem necessary with any other nations
having rights in any way connected with
the construction or operation of such ca
nal or canals. The President shall ac
quire, if possible, the absolute title to
necessary territory, but if such absolute
title cannot be obtained he may acquire
such rights or easements there as may
be required and may cause investigation
to be made to ascertain the route upon
which terms most favorable to exclusive
Control by the United States can be ob
tained, but in no case shall obligations be
incurred or money paid to any company,
or individual, for rights, easements or
privileges heretofore or hereafter ac
quired with a view to the construction' of
any such canal, except under authority
given by further action of Congress.
One million dollars Is appropriated to
carry out the act. The information ob*
tamed or action that may be taken
shall be reported to Congress at the
beginning of the next regular session.
AIMED AGAINST THE
SEATING OF ROBERTS
Favorable Report on Proposed
Amendment Prohibiting the
Election of Polygamists.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â A favorable
report on tW proposed constitutional
amendment prohibiting polygamists from
being elected to Congress was made In
the House to-day by Representative Ca
pron of Rhode Island in behalf of the
Committee on Election of President and
Vice President. It refers to the case of
Representative-elect B. H. Roberts of
Utah as one of the causes for renewing
attention to the subject. After reviewing
this case the report states that its de
termination rests with the next Congress.
On the general subject, however, it urges
an amendment to the constitution, and
says:
"Enough has been presented to show
that the people of the United States,
through Congress, have placed on the
statute books their unequivocal and un
compromising hostility to the crime of
polygamy. Therefore, shall the possibili
ty be allowed to continue of electing to
Congress a person who is a polygamist
to participate in the framing of laws
for a people who have unmistakably, in
no uncertain way, but deliberately and
positively, declared that polygamy Is a
crime and a disease which should not be
tolerated In a civilized community, but
extirpated In the interest of the homes of
America, which constitute one of the na
tion's strongest bulwarks against moral
decay. We believe that if given the op
portunity the people will answer emphat
ically in the negative."
Tiburon Prepared for Fire.
TIBURON, Feb. 27.â The new fire de
partment of this town is now prepared for
any emergency. The California North
western Railway Company, under the di
rection of President Foster, has laid 1300
feet of pipe and put in a first-class pump
ing system. The apparatus was tried last
evening and everything proved satisfac
tory. At a meeting held after the trial
Charles McNeill was elected chief of the
department, Fred Hackett first assistant
and William Lewis second assistant. The
citizens of this community first realized
the danger to which the town would be
subjected in case of fire when an attempt
was made to burn the "Daily Supply"
store of Young & Mitchell. Since then
they have lost no time in providing the
town with a safeguard.
MADE SICK BY
CANNED BEEF
Soldiers Before Court of
Inquiry.
STORY OF ENLISTED MEN
THEY TELL OF THE MANY COM
PLAINTS MADE.
One Sergeant Declares That His Com
mand Suffered in Health, From
a Lack of Proper
Food.
Ppecia.l Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â When the
Army Court of Inquiry, organized to
inquire into the beef charges, met to
day after its two days' recess, Lieuten
ant Charles F. Dwyer of the Ninth In
fantry testified that he had been made
sick on one occasion by eating canned
roast beef stew, but otherwise his
health had not suffered.
A party of six enlisted men of the
Ninth Infantry next appeared. First
Sergeant Howard Alexander testified
that his regiment used both corned and
canned roast beef on the voyage from
Tampa to Santiago. There were many
complaints from the men as to the
canned roast beef. It nauseated the
men, had little taste and apparently
contained little nutriment.
The men finally got to throwing thÂ»
cans away or not drawing them, as the
meat frequeutly made them sick as
soon as they ate it. Witness was not
willing to say definitely whether it was
the canned meat or the malaria that
caused most of the sickness in the regi
ment. After getting into the city,
where the refrigerated beef was issued,
the men continued to be very sick,
nauseated and suffering from bowel
cohnplaints.. The sergeant thought
this all came from the refrigerated
meat; the gravy, especially, that came
from the refrigerated meat, seemed to
nauseate the men even more than the
meat Itself.
Sergeant Buckage, also of the Ninth,
was called. He testified that the men
did not like the canned roast beef. It
made them sick and they did not eat it
when they could get anything else.
Coming to the refrigerated beef. Ser
geant Buckage said there was little or
no complaint while in Santiago. After
the regiment got outside of town about
a quarter of the beef spoiled in transit
to the camp. What was left after
trimming off the spoiled part was con
sidered quite good. He did not know
that any man had been nauseated by
the refrigerated beef. But all the
regiment was sick on leaving Cuba,
with 50 per cent actually on the sick
report.
Replying to Colonel Gillespie, Buck
age said that from the 22d of June to
July the ration averaged one-half
short. Asked if he thought the com
mand actually suffered in health from
this lack of food, he replied very
simply: "I think it did. sir." He said,
however, that the men were not dis
posed to complain all the time, as they
felt the officers were doing all they
could for their men under the circum
stances.
The testimony of the others was of
the same general character. The en
listed men were ordered to report at
the court at 2 p. m. to-morrow.

NEW YORK. Feb. 27.â The latest
bulletins of Drs. Janeway and Dunham
last night indicate that the condition
of Rudyard Kipling Is slightly im-.

drive shortly before 6 o'clock last
night. Although very pale and tired
she looked greatly relieved, and other
relatives and friends of the family

to believe that the danger point had

Special Dispatch to The CalÃ
- SAN JOSE, Feb. 27.â The deposit o-rs
' of the Union Savings Bank held a meet

â¢ ance. The old board of directors of the
] bank was criticized and denounced by
W. Potter, C. \Y. Childs and Francis

'; mittee of stockholders called and asked
.â¢ that the depositors adopt resolutions re
questing the directors to resign. This
â  was done unanimously, and J. R.
Welch, F. W. Potter and Francis Pope

Francis Pope, a young attorney of
San. Francisco, whom the depositors
want to seÂ»^ elected a director, made a
lengthy statement erf the bank's affairs
"as. he found them after a careful study.
He said Attorney General Ford notified
. the Bank Commissioners last Saturday
"that the board of directors of the Union
'-â Sav'-ies Bank in its entirety must re
sign. Commissioner B. D. Murphy had
'reiterated this. Pope said President W.
H. Wright was practicing the purest
hypocrisy when he published the state
ment that the directors were looking
after the depositors' interests, and that
no- trouble would occur in paying them
-dollar for dollar. The audience ex
pressed approval. He said the direct
ors with the exception of "W. H.
Wright, had forfeited their right to
ho-ld office by borrowing from the bank.
Ward Wright owed the bank $Â»000,' N. (
â¢ Bowden $4239, Johnson $IK.OOO and E. A. ,
. Wheeler $307, while A. Friant was in- |
debted as ;he indorser on a number of j
notes W H. Wright was equally guilty
because with his knowledge the direct
ors had drawn the people's money ror
thÂ«ir own personal use.
"â¢ Pope has written a long letter to N.
Bowden, the bank's attorney, In which
he severely scores the board of direct- ,
ors He charges all the directors with
being guilty of a felony under section j

GERMANY'S RULING
FAVORS OUR FRUITS
Oranges, Lemons ar)d F^aisiQS No
Looger to Be ExamiQed for
San Jose Scale.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The Department of State has been In
formed by cable from Embassador White at Berlin that orders have
been issued according to which American oranges, lemons and raisins
imported, as well as American fresh or dried fruit passing through
Germany in bond, are no longer to be examined for San Jose scale.
The German Embassador to-day authorized the following: Ac
cording to cablegrams received at the Embassy to-day the Imperial
Secretary of State for the Interior has an interpretation of the im
perial order of the sth of February, 189 S. in which it is decreed that
certain kinds of fruit imported from America, such as oranges, lem
ons and raisins, are not to be regarded as "fruit" in the sense of the
imperial order and are therefore free from the San Jose scale inspec
tion provided for other fruit. Count Posadowski permitted further
the transit of fresh and dried as well as waste fruit (fruit refuse)
from America through Germany generally under the condition that the
goods are shipped through the German territory in bond.
THRICE FANNED
BY DEATH'S WING
Grim Despair of an Aged
Criminal.
Special DlFpatoh to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 27.â John Davis,
an old man from Napa, evidently de
rived enough pleasure out of life to
take no active measure toward -crossing
the dark river until last night. At that
time he was arrested by night watch
man Jacob Miller and charged with
grand larceny pursuant to an order
from Sheriff Dunlap of Napa County.
Since his arrest Davis has tried to de
part this life in three different ways,
every one of which came within an ace
of being successful, and Sheriff Tay
lor now has the prisoner closely guard
ed by two officers in order to prevent
his committing suicide.
A few weeks ago Davis stole a horse
and buggy at Napa, and, failing in an
endeavor to sell them, tied the horse
to a tree about ten miles from the city
and disappeared. Notification of the
crime and a description of the thief
were sent throughout the State, with
the result that last evening Miller ar
rested a man on suspicion and confined
him in the town jail. He afterward
admitted that he was the person
wanted.
At about 8 o'clock a prisoner named
Grover summoned Jailer Atchley to his
cell by shouting that I>avis was dying.
Dr. W. F. Jones was called and ar
rived just in time to use the stomach
pump and save the old man's life. It
was found that he had swallowed a
large dose of laudanum, which the offi
cer 'had failed to discover when the
prisoner was searched.
Grover sounded the alarm again at 4
o'clock this morning, yelling that Davis
was bleeding to death. With a wicked
looking knife he had severed the veins
of his left wrist and stabbed himself
three times in the breast. Grover and
the jailer managed to bind the wounds
sufficiently to stop the flow of blood,
and the old man dropped into a heavy
slumber, from which he did not awake
until this afternoon.
It is the custom to permit the prison
ers to roam around the corridor for a
part of the day. While Grover was out
of the cell Davis took a small rope
which he had carried wound around his
body and was making preparations to
hang himself to the door of the cell.
Another inmate perceived that Davis
was again trying to end his life, and
informed Under Sheriff Benson, who
took the rope away.
Since then Davis has been kept under
close surveillance, and he will be
watched until an officer arrives to take
him to Napa. The old man admits the
crime, and says that he carried the
laudanum, the knife and the rope,
which he called his "friends," In ex
pectation of being arrested. He told
Constable Treanor to-day that the next
time he would make "a good job of it,"
and declared he would never be tried
firf his deed.

KINGSTON. Jamaica, Feb. 27.â
Further advices from Cayenne, French
Gutana, say that additional French
troops have been dispatched to Couanl
because the Governor had information
that a strong body of Brazilians were
proceeding up the river. It is pre
sumed the French troops went to meet
them.
Every effort Is being made to sup
press the news. .But private advices
received from fugitive settlers say the
present state of affairs is due to
the Brazilians, who attacked the
Frenchmen, and forced the latter to act
in self defense after a hot dispute be
tween the commissioners, from which
the Brazilians hastily withdrew and
removed to their camp. In the col
lision a few men were killed and some
were wounded on both sides.
The camps, its appears, subsequent
ly maintained a watchful peace while
awaiting instructions. The natives are
said to be preparing to join in the fight
ing if hostilities are renewed, which is
causing the foreign settlers to flee from
the disturbed district, abandoning their
property. â¢
FOR THE DEFENSE OF
YOUNG JESSE JAMES
Among Witnesses Called to Prove an
Alibi Are the Mother and Grand
mother of the Accused.
KANSAS CITY, Feb. 27.â The defense
in the train robbery case of Jesse James
to-day endeavored to prove an alibi for
the defendant and to impeach or dis
prove the prosecution's witnesses, espe
cially Passenger W. J. Smith, who on
Saturday identified James as one of the
robbers. It was divulged that Smith had
once been arrested for stealing flour. The
past life and character of James and his
general good reputation in this commu
nity, where he has lived ever since he was
a child, will be shown by the defense be
fore it closes.
A feature of the day's proceedings was
the appearance of Mrs. Zerelda Samuels,
74 years old, mother of the notorious
James brothers and grandmother of the
defendant. She testified that she was at
the James home on the night of the rob
bery, and that Jesse was sitting on the
porch with her when they heard the ex
plosion of the dynamite that wrecked the
express safes. Jesse James' mother, his
sister and the defendant himself gave
testimony to the same effect.
Mrs. Samuels attracted much attention
In the courtroom. Mrs. Samuels carried
one empty sleeve, her right arm having
been shot off by detectives who bombard
ed her house in attempting to arrest her
notorious sons. *
FEARS OF AN ATTEMPT
ON THE QUEEN'S LIFE
Why Victoria Has Abandoned the
Contemplated Trip to the Riveira
in March.
NEW YORK. Feb. 2.â A special to thÂ©
World from London says: The World
correspondent hears to-night that Queen
Victoria has practically decided to aban
don her projected visit to the Rivelra. She
had arranged to start March 8.
This change of plans is not due to any
friction with France, but because of the
constant personal attacks by which her
advent has been heralded in the Nicois
Journal. .Remembering the assassination
of the "Empress of Austria, it is feared
that these attacks may incite some half
demented person to make an attempt on
the Queen's life, the mere shock of which
might prove fatal at her advanced age.
BABY CLIMBS UPON
A KITCHEN STOVE
Its Clothing Is Ignited and Death
Ends Its Agony Three
Hours Later.
CAYUCOS, Feb. 27.â The Infant son of
George W. Gillls, living fifteen miles
from here, was burned to death yester
day. While its mother was absent from
the kitchen, the child climbed upon the
stove and Its clothes caught flre. It lived
three hours.
The mother had just started the flre
and gone Into the yard after an armful
of wood, leaving the child on the floor.
She was gone only a few moments. Dur
ing her absence the child climbed up to
the stove and its clothes were ignited,
probably by a spark. When the mother
returned she was horrified at seeing the
baby's hair all ablaze and all its clothes
burned off except the shoes and stockings.
The house was open and a strong north
wind had fanned the spark Instantly into
a flame. The entire body was horribly
burned. The baby was her only child,
aged 13 months, and was Just beginning
[ to walk.
SLAUGHTER IN THE
MANILA STREETS AS
TOLD BY FILIPINOS
Aguinaldo's Representatives, of
Course, Place All the Blame
on Americans.
PARIS, Feb. 27.â The Filipino Junta
here received to-day a cablegram from
Manila, February 24, via Hongkong. It
says:
"The fire broke out in the Chinese
quarter during the Chinese new year
festivities. The Americans provoked
the owners by demolishing houses be
fore it was necessary. The Filipinos'
fire engine, owned by Senor Ganco and
worked by British subjects, was largely
instrumental in extinguishing the fire.
The Americans interfered with the na
tive salvagers and tried to capture the
engine, leading to a conflict. Harsh
conduct elsewhere led to general fight
ing. The Americans retired to the
walled city and the fleet bombarded the
suburbs, believing the city was en
dangered. This caused the Tondo fire.
"Aguirialdo's troops then attacked
and entered Tondo, Santa' Cruz arid
Guaipo. Conflagrations broke out at
Binondo and Malad and the city was
surrounded by a line of burning houses.
"The fighting continued Wednesday
and Thursday. The Americans by that
time were greatly fatigued by the sun,
fires and continual service." On the
other hand the Filipinos were continu
ously reinforced and the Americans
closed the Puente de Espana, to pre
vent the Filipinos from invading the
walled city. The Americans then fired
on every one standing at the doors and
windows and thus killed the engineer
of the Andrews cotton mill. The for
eigners applied to the foreign ships for
help and a number of marines were to
be landed when Admiral Dewey inti
mated that such landing would be an
act of hostility and that his ships would
fire upon any landing party. Some
British bluejackets, however, landed
unarmed to act as firemen and re
mained to guard the British consulate,
banks and other British property. The

BALLARD, Feb. 27.â 1n spite of ad
verse weather conditions grain that
was sown on well cultivated land is
strong, of good color, and will stand
several weeks of dry weather. A large
acreage thoroughout the Santa Tnez
Valley was simply "scratched in," and
would not make a crop under favorable
"circumstances. The Santa Ynez Land
and Improvement Company, controlling
a large portion of these' farming lands,
has announced that henceforth all grain
lands must be plowed at least five

SEEKS ABSOLUTE DIVORCE
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â The fact that
Mrs. Elvia Crox Seabrooke has finally be
gun a suit for absolute divorce aginst her
husband, Thomas Q. Seabrooke, the actor,
came out in the Supreme Court to-day,
when Attorney A. H. Hummel, represent
ing Mrs. Seabrooke, applied to Justice
Glldersleeve for the appointment of a
commission to take the testimony in the
suit in San Francisco.
The matrimonial differences of the Sea
brookes have been aired on many occa
sions, and rumors that the pretty actress
intended to sue for an absolute divorce
have been going the rounds among theat
rical folk for many months. Until now,
however, Mrs. Seabrooke has been satis
fled with a suit for separation only.
The facts upon which the new suit is
based were kept secret to-day. The name
of the corespondent was guarded closely
by Mr. Hummel. According to Hummel,
Mrs. Seabrooke is now the prima donna
of an opera company touring the Pacific
Coast. Justice Gildersleeve to-day said
he would grant Hummel's application for
a commission to take testimony.

the defendant to-day by Superior Judge
F. M. Angellotti.
The first ground was decided not well
taken, because Creed was pardoned out of
San Quentin on May 25, 18X1, his citizen
ship being thereby restored. As regards
i the second .ground. Judge Angellotti de
| cided that, as the official proclamation of
! the Board of Supervisors called for the
I election of two men and the ballots were
marked for two, those directions should
have been followed by the electors with
i out regard to what wag told them by the
i election officials. The election proelama
j tion should have been held as final.
It was further stated in the decision
'â â  that if the precincts complained of had
been thrown out the result would have
| been the same.
SUBJECT TO BE DEBATED.

Americans searched British buildings
seeking insurgents.
"Indiscriminate street shooting was
prevalent. Men, women and children
were killed. The bodies of 140 Ameri
cans have already been collected. Their
loss in killed and wovlnded will reach
400. The bodies of 320 Filipino men, 425

ANTI-AMERICAN
DECREE OF FILIPINOS
HONGKONG, Feb. 27.â The Filipino
Government has issued another viru
lent anti-American decree, in which
the following passages occur:
The American guns respect neither hon
or nor property, but barbarously mas
sacre women and children. Manila has
witnessed the most massacres. Conns
cation of the properties and savings or
the people at the point of the bayonet and
shooting the defenseless, accompanied by
odious acts of abomination, repugnant
barbarism and racial hatred, are worse
than the doings in Carolina, Unless you
conjure a holy war for independence you
are only worthy to be slaves and pariahs.
Proclaim before the civilized world that
vnu will fight to the death against Amer
ican treachery and brute force. Even the
women should, if necessary. American
professions and promises are pure hypoc
risy They covet the spoils of this patri
mony of our race, wishing to implant here
a more irritating and barbarous dominion
than in the past.

Your other organs may need care, but
your kidneys most, because they do
most.
If you are sick, begin with your kid-
neys, because as soon as they are well
they will help all the other organs to
health.
The treatment of some diseases may
be delayed without danger, not so with
kidney disease.
Swamp-Root is the great medical tri-
umph of the nineteenth century; dis-
covered after years of untiring effort
and research by the eminent kidney and
bladder specialist. Dr. Kilmer, and has
truly wonderful healing action on the

OFF SANTA BARBARA
Peculiar Movements of a Strange
Craft Near Anacapa
Island.
SANTA BARBARA, Feb. 27.â For many
years it has. been thought that Santa Bar
bara and vicinity were the base of a nest
of systematic smugglers. On several oc
casions during the last ten years the Gov
ernment has sent detectives here to in
vestigate, and although they always felt
sure smuggling was being carried on they
have never succeeded in getting any defi
nite Information. Last Wednesday, as
Captain Abrabas of the Olita was round
ing the east end of Santa Cruz Island, he
saw a strange vessel apparently anchored
off the west shore of Anacapa Island, four
miles distant. .He could see a skiff low
ered and three men enter it after consid
erable delay and make for the shore. With
the smuggler stories fresh in mind he
made for the strange vessel and got with
in two miles of her, when she took on
board the skiff and made for the open sea.
Her movements were very strange, hut as

REPUBLICAN PLEDGES.
WHILE the election of Dan. Burns would be a
knockout blow, his defeat, not because of his
intrinsic importance, but as a demonstration of
sincerity, would give the Republican party the great
est, lift it has had for years. The Republican press
and the Republican speakers during the last campaign
assured the people of two factsâ first, that the ques
tion of funding the debt of the Central Pacific was
settled, and therefore not an issue, which was strictly
true; and, second, that the railroad was out of poli
tics, which was based upon railroad assurances be
lieved to be true, but in reality false. The election
largely turned on these statements, which gave a rea
sonable guarantee to sound money Democrats, as well
as to Republicans, that, without treachery of any kind,
the important issues declared in the platforms were to
be settled. The result was a vindication of Repub
lican principles in this State that corresponded to their
triumph throughout the Union.
That the railroad has falsified its declaration* and
that Dan Burns is its candidate is proved to a moral
certainty. Political hardihood would shrink from de
nying these facts. Even though he were qualified,
even though he were not fatally disqualified, there
fore, his success would mean that the State organi
?ation of the Republican party, aided and abetted by
municipal and county organizations, deliberately
cheated the people. No party could stand this dis
honorable record. On the other hand, if the railroad
be held down to its promises, if Republican pledges
-ire redeemed, and if some honorable, competent and
independent gentleman, of whom there are some before
â  the" Legislature and many in the party, be elected in
the face of the unholy combinations and the bold de
fiance of the people that have marked the candidacy
of Dan Burns, public confidence will be justified and
increased to an extent that will insure Republican
success, at least in State elections, for years to come.
The railroad makes a hard fight because of its concen
trated selfishness and its secret machinations in busi
ness and among individuals. No intelligent and hon
â¢orable citizen desires to injure its interests. But its
own welfare would be promoted by the defeat of Dan
Burns. Its rights can be and ought to be protected,
but it does not own and cannot permanently domi
nate the State, and there is n.o reason why its disquali
fied representative should be promoted to a Federal
Senatorship. The obstinacy that would insist upon such
an outrage and such a repudiation of formal pledges
would be an evidence not of power but of weakness.
Moreover, no member of the Legislature who has any
respect for himself or ambition for the future can
afford to break his word, and, in view of the excep
tionally definite and positive assurances of 1898, in
which every candidate on the Republican ticket was
represented, subserviency to the railroad designs,
scenting the bait and entering the trap sprung by the
announcement of Dan Burns on January 2, 1899,
would be a disgraceful infidelity from which there could
be no recovery. This is an instance similar to the
case of Howard E. Wright, in which the -.claptrap of
vindication from substantial charges will surely fail.
Each legislator who disgusts his constituents and
satirizes his State by a vote against his pledge and
his conscience will be more likely to draw to himself
the reproach that Caesar addressed to Brutus â "et tv
quoque mi fili."
Chinatown should be kept under police rule as
strict as martial law. Among other reforms there
ought to be that depriving the Chinese of the right
â¢to possess arms. Every person and every house needs
to be searched in the interest of public safety, and the
Chinese found with knife or gun be given the limit
of the law.
The report that the Quay jury had been "fixed"
will pain the Pennsylvania Senator, particularly if
true, for the trial has been postponed, and any fixing
there may have been will represent useless expense.
While the change in the management of the pound
is satisfactory it would have been more pleasing still
had it involved the impounding of a lot of the subor
dinate ruffians who have been connected with it.
The officer who testified that he thought the army

ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT.
IT is expected that Jerry Simpson and other Jerries
will attack the President personally in connection
with public policies, and it is not expected that
they will be scrupulous in picking the mud they
throw. But when the President is attacked from his
own political household the matter takes on a totally
different aspect. Mr. Johnson of Indiana, who here
tofore commanded much respect by his independence
in voting on public questions, has compelled disre
spect by his personal attack on the President. The
House and the country will listen patiently and profit
ably to argument and reason for and against holding
the Philippines and indefinite extension of our bor
ders and our power, but neither the House nor the
country heard- with patience or profit Mr. Johnson's
envenomed attack on the motives of the President.
His statement that the executive has been controlled
entirely in taking or letting alone islands and cities by
the inter^| of men who gave large sums to his cam
paign in 1896 is something exceedingly, vile and unbe
coming. Mr. Joiinson does not pretend recently ac
quired knowledge of such contributions nor of their
requital. He enlarges this piece of evidence as an ac
cessory, but it is significant that he did not turn state's
evidence until after his own defeat for re-election and
the close of his own public career. His righteous soul
remained steeped in the sulphurous knowledge of
these campaign contributions for nearly three years
before it got on the housetop and proclaimed iniquity
from the ridgepole thereof. The stomach of his con
science never turned until he saw the backs of his con
stituency, and then he retched in public and spilled the
soured contents of his memory into the Congressional
Record.
The country, has not been moved to mutiny and
rage against the President by this exhibition, and the
only effect visible is the exertion of stepping over the
muss Mr. Johnson made in getting rid of something
which, if he had at all, was one of the confidences that
public men respect. Plain and honest people think
that if he felt so about campaign contributions and
knew that these had been made he should have re-
signed his seat long ago and appeared in the political
highway with his staff and scrip to denounce the in
iquity which has nauseated him only just now, so long
after the fact.
The opponents of expansion and all for which it
stands will keenly regret that Mr. Johnson, and his
emetic emotions are not on the other side of the
question, and will begin to despair at the sinister pros
pect offered by such allies as he and Colonel Bryan.
The President has repeatedly said that Congress is
to make permanent disposition of the Philippines, and
Congress is to be reached and controlled by the peo
ple who elect it. The way to finally determine the
whole issue, then, is by going to the people with rea
son, argument and fact, and not with the weapons of
detraction and betrayal with which Mr. Johnson has
armed his too active jaw.
THE POUND RESCUED.
THE Committee on Health and Police of the
Board of Supervisors at a meeting Friday agreed
to report in favor of appointing James VV. Wal
ton to the position of poundkeeper, vice F. A. Os
born, term expired. Mr. Walton is a member of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
has been appointed for the purpose of again giving
that organization control of the public pound.
The pound was taken from the society by the late
Democratic Board of Supervisors solely for politi
cal reasons. No charges had been filed against the
poundkeeper, and there were no allegations that he
had not discharged his duties satisfactorily, but the
politicians wanted the pound, and the board in a weak
moment acceded to their wishes.
The result has been an unending series of scan
dals. Scarcely a week has passed sjnee the change was
made that the Police Judges have not been called
upou to adjudicate charges against deputy pound
keepers. Men have been assaulted, women insulted,
small boys whipped, all sorts of cruelties perpetrated
upon animals, and lawlessness in every form indulged
in by the poundkeeper's deputies. In their pursuit ol
fees these officials have entirely disregarded not only
the law, but the rights of the people.
Considerable pressure was brought to bear upon the
late board with a view to inducing it to again return
the control of the pound to the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals, but all the influence
that could- be exerted was ineffectual. The politicians
having got hold of the pound refused to let go. It
is to the credit of the Committee on Health and Po
lice that it at last has dismissed the political pound
keeper and restored the institution to its old man
agers. Outrages of all kinds will now cease, because
the members of the society are reputable citizens who
will not tolerate lawless conduct on the part of their
employes. Besides, the cruelties that have heretofore
been practice ' .vill be discontinued. Thus the people
and the anin als will make a clear gain, and the
Board at Supervisors will receive the credit which is
its due.
MUNICIPAL PROBLEMS.
A WORK of considerable value to all students of
municipal problems is a newly issued pamphlet
containing the proceedings of the second an
nual convention of the League of American Munici
palities held at Detroit last year.
The discussions, which occupied four days, covered
a wide range, and included every important depart
ment of municipal work. Their value lies in the fact
that the debates were not by theoretical speculators
en government, but by men who had performed in
office the work of civic adminstration, and who, there
fore, spoke from a practical knowledge of the sub
jects.
One of the most interesting features of the pro
ceedings was the showing made of the results attained
in the municipal ownership and operation of water
works. Thus ex-Mayor Hillyer "of Atlanta reported
that the city owns its water works and has been oper
ating them for twenty-one years. Water thoroughly
filtrated and cleansed is furnished to private parties at
10 cents per thousand gallons; manufacturers are sup
plied at a graduated rate proportioned to the quan
tity used, and hydrants are established at various parts
of the city where, washerwomen and the poor obtain
an abundant supply*tree of cost. The total cost of the

the complex problems of a modern city. In that way
much good has been already accomplished, and it is
likely the beneficial effects will increase as the work
of the league goes on. The publications of the pro

|~\ERHAPS before these lines meet the eye Rud-
L/ yard Kipling will have been called from the
* sphere in which, towering high above all his
fellows, he is acknowledged master. Literature could
not in the death of any other one person sustain a loss
so grievous as would be inflicted were the eyes of this
giant of letters, this sorcerer of phrase, to be forever
closed now when his mental powers can be reckoned
scarcely to have reached their zenith.
There is none to take his place. There is no other
poet whose work is so majestically resonant. There is
no other whose songs can stir principalities and peo
ples, nor who, pouring <^it his soul in verse, can start
a wave of emotion which stops only at the outermost
bound where English is spoken. The power to do
this belongs to Kipling alone. Each time he has ut
ttred his thought in the heroic meter which imitation
vainly essays it has been as though a thrill passed over
the universe of intellect. It has been the voice of
nation to nation, or the trumpet tone of one inspired
thundering warnings to a world. And the world has
heeded.
Not alone as a poet must Kipling be judged. His
prose is luminous, strong, fascinating. Had he never
written a line of poetry, his renown would have been
secure, He never touched upon a theme, however
commonplace in itself, but there was in the finished
product the distinct mark of genius. His short
stories excel those of any among authors who have
entered that field, for they do not depend upon the
horrible and the grotesque. Some of them are from
beginning to end an expression of happiness. In
some there is a depth of pathos most sweet and ten
der and true. Some have the element of horror, and
they are uncanny, terrible, holding the reader to the
end captivated and overwhelmed with a sense of the
superior mind conceiving them and the unapproach
able style of their treatment.
England claims Kipling, but America denies that
he can be considered less than the common property
of the Anglo-Saxon race. He has written for all of
us. America admires and loves his work. In the
veins of his children there runs American blood. His
fame is as wide as civilization, his following not lim
ited by the lines of republic nor empire.
Everywhere there are fervent prayers that the
writer and poet shall be spared, and if he be taken
the residents of the continents and of the isles of the
sea will mourn with an equal sorrow.
OSCAR POLACK, a Hamburg importer of
California products, who is now in this State
on business, gave our fruit-packers and
shippers a good deal of sound advice through an in
terview published in The Call of Monday. In the
course of his counsel as to the best means of promot
ing the consumption of California fruits in Europe
Mr. Polack said:
"California growers should also see to it that when
they export their goods there should be nothing mis
leading in the labels. There appears to be a laxity of
method in the labeling, 'prime' and 'fancy' being used
indiscriminately, and 'choice' being applied to fine
yellow apricots, for instance, as well as to the black
and poorer grade. Then, too, they should guard
against having their cases branded as I saw some once
in a Hamburg warehouse. On one end of the case
was printed 'Italian prunes,' while on the other end
read 'Fancy California prunes.' They came from a
New York firm and had been put up by the Van
couver Packing Company of Vancouver, B. C. I
took them to be Oregon prunes from the thick skin
and large pit, but the flavor was good, though slightly
acid. This conflict of labeling should be stopped, fox
it tends to shake confidence in the shipper."
By that statement attention is again directed to the
practice of fraudulent labeling which has now become
one of the most serious evils of our commerce and one
of the greatest handicaps placed upon the progress of
honest industry. Mr. Polack is in error, however, in
supposing the wrong to be one which Californians
can remedy. We are the victims and not the per
petrators of the practice. When the products of other
States are marked as the products of California it is
not in our power to prevent or to punish.
For some time past the New York dairymen have
been making earnest efforts to procure the enactment
by Congress of a law requiring all products to be
honestly labeled as to the place where produced and
the name of the packer. California ought to cordially
assist the New Yorkers in their contest. We are
even greater sufferers than New York from fraudu
lent labeling, and it is to be hoped Mr. Polack's clear
statement of the damage to our fruit trade in Europe
by the practice will have the effect of rousing our peo
ple to the importance of procuring national legisla
tion on the subject.
THE tribute paid to The Call by the often
repeated declaration that it is one of two jour
nals that have so far blocked the shameful game
of Dan Burns and the railroad is complimentary, but
undeserved. The public or legislative memory is
hardly short enough for the vast number of extracts
from influential papers in the interior of the State, and
for the numerous resolutions of Republican Central
Committees antagonizing this indescribable candi
dacy, to have been forgotten. This kind of material,
which illustrates the almost unanimous sentiment of
Republicans and other reputable citizens, is still pro
duced daily in this State and in other States, and has
so enormously accumulated that its republication
would require a special edition.
Then the qualified and respectable Republican gen
tlemen at Sacramento whose supporters have thus far
almost held down Burns and Grant to their original
votes deserve some credit, which The Call has no de
sire to appropriate. It would be as puzzling to find
any solid influence, apart from the railroad and its
satellites, in favor of Dan Burns as it would be to
discover any party service in his record or any per
sonal qualifications in him that would justify or pal
liate his success.

SUPERVISORS
WILL APPEAL
TREIR CASE
They Gain by the
First Decision.
IN AN ANOMALOUS POSITION
PLAN FOR A MISSION PARK GOES
OVER UNTIL JUNE.
Proceedings Looking to the Condem
nation of the Former Jewish
Cemetery Post
poned. '^
An Innocent resolution, recommending
that special counsel be employed to ap
peal the case of the Mutual Electric Lighi
Company against the city to the Supreme
Court, precipitated a heated debate at the
meeting of the Supervisors yesterday.
The resolution was presented by Super
visor Kalben, and for a time he was alone
in the open fighting for it. He was joined
later by Supervisors Collins and Holland
while the opposition was represented by
Supervisors Byington, Laekmann and
Deasy. After the resolution, which called
for the appointment of John H. Durst as
special counsel for the board, had been
read a request was made that It be read
again. The discussion then ensued on the
point as to why the city should appeal a
case when its loss meant a benefit to the
public. Supervisor Byington desired to
know why the board should appeal. Under
the decision of the Superior Court there
will be competition tn lighting, which
meant reduction in price.
In defense of the resolution Supervisor
Collins said the law was on the side of
the board, and he for one did not like to
see the case go against the members. He
did not want to stand in the way of public
improvements, but he would be sorry to
see this decision go against them. Super
visor Byington pressed the question as to
why, if he was in favor of public im
provements, he stood in the way of the
Mutual Electric Light Company and its
right to erect poles. Mayor Phelan came
to ths aid of Mr. Byington, saying the
constitution allows corporations the right
tQ use the streets for the erection of poles
"without permission of the authorities.
Supervisor Holland suggested that an
appeal be taken and a speedy hearing se
cured, as there seemed a decided differ
ence of opinion in the premises. He
thought this action would bo better for
the electric company and for all con
cerned. Mr. Laekmann urged that the
city should not appeal. Such action would
benefit the gas company, and that cor
poration could test the case if it desired.
The city should not bear the expense when
others would derive the benefit. He
thought the decision was along "proper
lines and should be vjjheld and the fran
chise granted.
Upon a vote being taken It was -decided
to appeal the case. Those in favor of the
appeal were: Holland, Kalben. Black,
Phelps, Collins, Heyer and Attridge. The
minority was composed of Perrault, Laek
mann, Byington, Deasy and Aigeltinger.
A resolution was presented declaring the
intention of the board to commence con
demnation proceedings to acquire the old
Jt-wish cemeteries, bounded by Eight
eenth, Twentieth, Dolores and Church
streets. The property owners were asked
to file with the board before March 13
statements of what they consider their
land worth. After a short discussion it
was decided to defer action until the end
of the fiscal year, in June.'
The City and County Attorney was di
rected to examineinto the status of the
title of the city and county to the strip
of land 200 feet on each side of Fillmore
street," "between Bay street on the south
and the water front line on the north, and
to institute such proceedings as he may
deem advisable to perfect the same if It
is found defective, and to secure the re
moval of all obstructions to the free use
and enjoyment by the city of the wharf
privileges heretofore exercised by it. This
has reference to the property inclosed by
the Fair estate at Black Point.
The Superintendent of the Fire Alarm
was notified to ascertain if the globes
of arc lamps can be used fnr indicating
the location of fire alarm boxes. Seventv
seven street gas lamps where electric
lights are also maintained were ordered
extinguished upon the recommendation of
Gas Inspector Tupper, that they were a
useless expense.
In accordance with a communication
from the secretary of the State Commis
sion for Insane, the "board notified the
caretaker of the insane ward of the Re
ceiving Hospital that he must turn over
all money received from insane patients
to the Sheriff.
F. A. Osborn was dismissed from his
position of Poundkeeper, and James W.
"Walton was made his successor. The
change will take place March 1.
A petition was presented by a number
of firms requesting the board to dredge
the south side of Channel street imme
diately beneath the draw-bridge at the in
tersection of Fourth and Channel streets.
Owing to the accumulation of debris the
passage of vessels is made impossible.
A protest was presented by property
owners on De Long avenue against
the paving, of that thoroughfare from
Frederick street southerly.
The board was asked for additional wa
ter supply and hydrants in the district
contiguous to San Bruno avenue and
Twenty-fifth street.
J. H. Belser was granted a license to
solicit signatures to private contracts for
street work.
H. E. Law, president of Van Ness Ave
nue Improvement Club, requested the
board to increase the Police Department.
He claimed the northern part of the city
suffered from the force not being up to
the prescribed strength. He complained
of the recklessness of the criminal ele
ment, claiming to have had a house stolen
in its entirety.
The Holly Park and Mission Street Im
provement Club asked that the money
appropriated and already set aside for the
Improvement of Holly Park, bo expended
on the same. . .
Chairman Perrault of the Finance Com
mittee announced that the investigation
into the affairs of the gas company had
been postponed until March 7.
The Street Committee was not ready to
report upon the matter of granting per
mission to the Market Street Railway
Company to run its ' electric cars into
Kearny street from Geary street.
The desk of Secretary John A. Russell
was decorated with a magnificent basket
of flowers. The accompanying card bore
the inscription:
"John A. Russell, Esq., 'Come 33.' Com
pliments and best wishes of. thirteenth
member."
This was from Colonel W. E. Llttlfc,
manageY of the Sutro estate. Upon tne
adjournment of the meeting Mayor Phe
lan congratulated Mr. Rusfcell upon his
thirty-three years' service in the board.
His sentiments were applauded by the
members. -
TWO BANKRUPTS.
One of Them Does Not Know What

day in the United States District Court.
He alleged that on the sth of January of
this year his goods were attached by the
Sheriff of Santa Cruz and sold on the 26th
of the same month. There are some debts
due him, but the petitioner is unable to
give the names of his debtors or the sums
owing, because his books are in the hands
of the Sheriff under attachment.

NO CHANGE IN
THE PRESENT
WATER SATES
Five Supervisors Fa
vored Reduction.
LINES WERE SHARPLY DRAWN
MAJORITY DID NOT TALK, BUT
THEY VOTED.
Byington and Lackmann Amend
ments Cutting Spring Valley
Estimates Were Re
jected.
For the first time since its organizattor
the lines were somewhat sharply drawn ir
the Board of Supervisors yesterday ovei
the order fixing the water rates for the
coming year. By a vote of sewn to five
the existing rates were readopted.
As exclusively announced in The Cal
yesterday morning Supervisors Lackmanr
and Byington made an effort to secure a
reduction. They were 'supported by Su
pervisors Perrault, Deasy and Heyer. Hol
land, KaJben Black, Phelps, Collins, At
tridge and Aigeltinger composed the ma^
jority.
The water committee met at 9:30 in the
committee room and Chairman Phelps
presented a typewritten report re-enact
ing the present rates, which was signed
by the chairman, Kalben, Black, Attridge
arid Aigeltinger. Lackmann demurred to
this plan and argued for a horizontal' re
duction of the estimates submitted by the
Spring Valley company and also reducing
the interest on the capital stock, which he
claimed was fictitious to a certain extent.
Failing to swerve the majority of the
committee from the report agreed upon
before the meeting, Mr. Lackmann an
nounced that he jvould present a minority
report to the board.
It is claimed by the majority of the
I board who voted for the old rates and
| also by the representatives of the water
I company that under the order the Spring
I Valley will only realize 5 per cent on the
[ money invested, and that if the season
i should be a dry one the returns to the
stockholders will be still smaller.
Attached to the majority report, which
was read as soon as the board convened,
was a copy of the rate schedule passed
by the former board. This was accepted
without reading, as all the members were
familiar with the rates. Supervisor By
ington presented an amendment to this
order which provided for a reduction or
15 per cent In fixed rates for householders
and also cut the meter rates 10 per cent.
Mr. Deasy seconded Bylngton's order. By
ington, in advocating his order, said it
was based on fair compensation to the
Spring Valley company for the amount of
property in actual use. In its statement
the company had included a vast amount
of lnnd which was not in use and probably
never would be, yet the water consumers
of the city were to be forced to pay in
terest on this property if the old rates
were again adopted. This contention was
supported by Messrs. Lackmann and
Deasy. The amended order was voted
down, however, by the following vote:
Ayesâ Perrault, Lackmann, Byington
H |^s-H e olfan~d s ; Kalben, Black. Phelps
The^order submitted by Mr. Lackmanr
was then put on passage and the repre
! sentative from the Sixth Ward asked that
it be adopted. He declared that the ma
loritv report 'was unfair to the- people ol
this city in that it compelled them to pay
an exorbitant price for the first necessity
of life He claimed that 51.5W.000 included
! in the Spring Valley's list of estimate*
1 was for property not in use, and he de
clared that the operating expenses were
beyond reason. From the latter estimate
of "$473 000 he asked a reduction of $14b,000.
and also sought to have other estimate*
cut accordingly. Mr. Lackmann's pro
posed reductions were published in yes
! terday's Call. The order introduced by
i Lackmann left the meter rates un
changed, but made a reduction of lo pet
cent in fixed rates. â 
Mr Lackmann said he had hoped that
Byington's schedule would prevail, but
inasmuch as It was rejected he thought
a reduction in the householders rate
i would be better than no reduction, and
he introduced his order as a compromise.
Mr Deasy said he had favored Bying
ton's order, as he considered it just to the
citizens. He reviewed the work done at
the recent lnvestigaion and declared the
city should not be compelled to pay thou
sands of dollars int.erest yearly on the
money expended by the water company
to acquire the CalaveraS supply, which
was bought to prevent the city from ob
taining a plant which would have given
half a million people cheap water He
declared that the company was yearly in
creasing its bond issue for a twofold pur
pose-first, to mulct the people by increas
ing the interest account, and second to
increase the alleged value of the property
so a big clean-up could be made later on
by selling the plant to the municipality.
Mr neasv said some means should be de
vised to "check this nefarious scheme and
Mayor Phelan suggested that the only so
lution was for thÂ« Supervisors to cut the
Interest on the company's Investment and
thereby stop the further issuance of
b Â°The' Mayor, hearing that a report was
in circulation that he favored the old wa
ter rates, declared he wished to go on
record as supporting Byington s order.
Supervisor Lackmann's order was voted
down and the report of the majority of
the water committee adopted by the 7 to 5
vote already given.

meeting of the Methodist ministers yester
day and delivered an interesting talk on
"Revivals," his method of conducting
them and the good results he has

teners, as they warmly encored him at
the close of his remarks.

SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
THE talking vest has come to town, and the uninitiated stand about in solemn Wonder or follow awe-Btrlcken in its
wake. It is a brilliant and gaudy garment with a gorgeouaness all its own. Its coloring makes the wing or the but
terfly pale into insignificance, and its pattern scheme shames the ultra school of the crazy-quilt cult. E Â»,nw
In spite of the many virtues that would naturally win for the new waistcoat a place in a swell rreaK snow,
.this, latest thing in the haberdasher's art is not confined within the narrow limits of a gilded cage, but is Bhown aauy

: In the vest question the society man-he of cotillon fame, the hero of the '"small and early and the cve J"r; V( ~r'
â  cavalier of the "pink tea"-is sadly overlooked. The barkeep, the sport, the swell literary guy. the actor, ana newno
knows just what is what leads the procession. To Willie Collier belongs the honor of introducing the gorgeous cowrea
vest to Western civilization. Willie came to us a year ago, and it took his imitators just a twelve month to r f^ n *Â® w "^
a smart thing the colored vest was. Now they all sport one, and any man who is bold enough to admit that ne c*> Â° c*e * "Â°*
own at least one $12 vest is the man whose name is needed to replace the king of beasts in the worn elmme as crave

As to who is the lucky possessor of the loudest vest in town much doubt exists. The honor has been variously
divided between Colonel Rowalaky. "Ske*ts" Martin and Charlie Dryden. Dryden's friends insist that his vests are
marked with the rare good taste of a modern Brummel, and that their exquisite coloring is in perfect keeping witn tne
Wearer"s delicate complexion. If, under these conditions, the colors peal like distant thunder it is not the wora juggler b
fault. He has but to change his cosmetics and all will be serene again. . ,
As for "Skeets" Martin, the honor of reconciling warring colors goes to him. In his vest he has peaeably united yei

;. ON TO SACRAMENTO.
; General Exposition Committee Goes
'â  ', â  â 'â '. ..' To-Morrow in Special Cars.
" ; 'There, was much interest and enthusi
asm manifested at the meeting of the gen
- eral committee of the Pacific Ocean and
: â¢ "International Exposition, held yesterday
: afternoon In the rooms of the Chamber
â  of Commerce. The meeting was called by
â¢ iPr'esident J. B. Reinstein to hear the re
; port of the legislative committee, which
--.went, to Sacramento for the purpose, of
"â :, securing the passage of such bills as
' â¢â might be necessary to insure an appro
priation from the Legislature.
â â Charles L. Pattern, as soon as the meet
i: 'ing.-ha.d been called to order, stated that
-. he; : with the other members of the legis
' Ytive committee, had been to Sacramento
â¢.' three times and had appeared before the
â¢â¢iVays and Means Committee. The bill
' j-sking for the appropriation of $000,000 had
â¢" .'LVeen favorably considered and was so re
â¢â â p'6rted by the committee to the Assembly,
:--iv-hich voted in favor of it, with the
: amendment that $200,000 was to be paid in
: the next fiscal year and. the remainder of
-the appropriation In the following fiscal
-.-.v.ear Mr Patton stated that the Finance
'.Committee of the Senate wanted some
' l morfe specific wording of the bill as to how
â¢ th* appropriation was to be expended, and
'â¢that the bill had been altered -so as to
â â â¢ read that the money was to be expended
V on the exposition which is to be held in
Ran Francisco.
' The main object of the meeting was to
â  find out how many of the committee were
'willing to go up to Sacramento for the
/purpose of showing to the Senate that the
â¢ influence and money of San Francisco was
. in favor of the exposition. Mr. Patton
"" said that the Senate wanted some demon
stration of a public nature that would
' prove to it conclusively that such was the
â¢ " case. He thought that sut^i a demonstra
> tlon would result in the passage of the
â¢bill by the Senate. The question was dis
â  -cussed at some length by W. H. Mills, J.
â¢ A Filcher, General R. H. Warfield. B. E.
â¢Hendrickson and Mr.. Patton. They
â¢ all agreed on the necessity of im
â¢ pressing the Senate with the fact
. that the present opportunity meant
â¢ much to Calirfornia, and that It
"; should not be neglected. They also agreed
that there was no time to be lost, if any
thing was to be done, and as a result it
was decided that as many, of the general
â¢ committee as were able should go to Sac
' ramento to-morrow morning on the 8
â¢ o'clock train, returning to-morrow night:
Â' The chair appointed Messrs. Stultz.
.â¢Filohor nnd Patton a committee to make
â  arrangements. Special cars will be at-.
: ta-checl to the train for the accommoda-*
Yion of the committee. At the .meeting at
â /least thirty members signified their.in
tention of going. The secretary was in
structed to notify all of the members of
â¢ the general committee and to get as many
"of them to go as would. It is desired. that
' a . farge number shall go, to as to -more
" forcibly impress apon the Legislature the

FOUR FIRST
CHOICES WON
AT OAKLAND
Defeat of Formero a
Surprise.

FINK'S MARE HARDLY FINISH
iD THIRD. â¢
â¢ â  â '
Giga Was Flayed for a Good Thing,
but Was Beaten by Thatcher.
Olinthus Made Friends by
His Victory.
The fields at Oakland yesterday were
of light caliber and favorites more than
held their own. Of six choices sent to
the post, Formero and Hardly, both rid
den by "Skeets" Martin, were the only
ones downed. The attendance was only
fair, and the books experienced a light
day.
The seven furlong purse run, for which
Formero reigned favorite, wes the live
liest betting affair of the afternoon. There
were but two other starters, Olinthus and
Napamax. The latter was reported to be
in bad shape and her showing was a poor
one. Martin rode a fearfully misjudged
race astride Formero, and after showing
first all the way Olinthus won by half a
length in 1:27^. The winner was well
backed by a few extremely smart right
handed bettors. He was the outsider of
the trio.
Barney Schrieber's filly Good Hope was
thrown in with some slow company in
the introductory overture, a sprint over
the Futurity course. She ruled an odds
on choice and at the wire disposed of Ann
Page at leisure.
The clever filly Torsida then took a
seven furlong run, with considerable to
spare at the end. The daughter of Tor
sion was backed to even money favorit
ism, and, never extended, led the 30 to 1
shot Guilder past the judges by four
lengths. Tammany Hall, second artioice,
found the pace too hot, finishing in the
In the two-year-old sprint, Giga, the
first of the get of Foul Shot, the Austra
lian horse, faced the barrier. The filly
started in the colors of J; Naglee Burke,
and after getting away from the post
none too well, ran a good second to Harry
Thatcher, the favorite.
Charley Fink's Hardly let the crowd
down with a hard drop 'over the result
of the mile and a sixteenth run. Sent to
the post a 4 to 5 chance, she finished in
the show. After extricating himself from
a pocket, Devin.on the second choice,
Merops, assumed the front position, win
ning hands down from Alicia, an out-
Horton looked pounds the best of the
lot in the concluding six furlong sprint,
and at very short odds took the verdict
without half trying from Malay.
Track Notes.
In future at Oakland track the recall
flag will be used in all two-year-old
events.
Ellis is riding in very good form Just
now and is getting many mounts. He put
up a very persuasive finish aboard the
long shot Guilder.
Hohenzollern ran a grand race for a
horse of his class, but it would be diffi
cult to convince a good many people ot
that fact.
Bookmaker Barney Schrieber was over
joyed at the rare good showing made by

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â The stock market con
tinued very invpular to-day and left off rather
heavy, but with fractional advances in the j
prominent shares. The railway shares as
sumed more prominence in the dealings than of
late, Important fluctuations occurring from time ,
to time In those properties, during which the
specialties were temporarily relegated to the
background. Prices were receding when, to
ward noon. It was i reported that AgulnaJdo
â was inclined to accept pacific overtures, and a
rally ensued. London was a moderate pur
chaser." Covering movements In' sugar ad
vanced the prices smartly, but free selling ap
peared, which- attracted particular attention,
as it was by brokers' who were believed to
represent houses prominent on the other side
of the stocks, and the stock lost its early gain
and closed but fractionally up , for the day.
Third Avenue dropped 22 points after an Initial
rise of 4. the weakness seemingly in realizing
â when it whs reported that the property would i
be absorbed by Metropolitan. American Steel
and Wire advanced on large dealings, but sub
sequently lost part of the rise. Federal Steel
to a lesser extent sympathized with both move- i
ments in American Steel and Wire. Atchlson
was weak during the early session of the
market, but firmed up. Subsequently it was
sold down, in common with the drive at the !
rest of the market. The grangers were In de
mand in the afternoon. They sagged, together
â¢with the specialties, during . the late selling. I
â  Some hardening in call money rates accompa
ni 1 the late selling movement.

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. Freezing temperatures
to-day throughout the winter wheat â¢ belt,

j firm. May started toe higher at 73%<a734c," but ,
I met considerable celling by scalpers, brought !
\by indifferent cables, and the price j
; sagged to 73c. The weakness did not last long,
'however, as Russian shipments last week were \
I found to have been only 664,000 bushels, and the j
receipts at domestic markets indicated some
reduction of farmers" deliveries. The down- j
i ward tendency of foreign markets, however, .
I somewhat dampened the spirits. of the bulls j
! and prevented the full fruition that might oth- i

at 73% c.

CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 87.â Journal .of Com
mence says: The situation in nil descriptions
of California dried fruits is reported to be a
very strong one. Supplies at present are said
to be much smaller than for many seasons past
at this time of the year, when the spring de
mand generally sets in. Recent storms have
curtailed the" movement of stocks into con
sumption, but for several days past Inquiry
has been quite brisk, and while Individual
transactions have been comparatively small
the aggregate sales have been rather larger
than Is generally the case In February. Them
la no speculative inquiry, the demand coming
wholly from distributors who need stock to
cover current wants of consumption.
Among California cured fruits, peaches and
apricots seem to be in particularly good d*^
mand. The stock of the former on spot is
said not to exceed fifteen cars and the bulk
of this, It Is understood. Is In the hands of one
house. With demands from consumers increas
ing the market la very strong, with an up
ward tendency. Of apricots on the spot there
are Bald to be not more than five cars all
told. The home demand Is active, but tho
limited supply, coupled with the high prices
demanded, restricts business. Interior markets
are coming to New York for supplies, their
own stocks being exhausted, while little or
nothing is obtainable on the coast. Numerous
Inquiries have been received here during the
past week from Chicago, Bt, Louis, Baltimore
and Philadelphia, but holders in New York am
Indifferent sellers, and consequently the in
terior trade has been able to secure only small
lots.

THE STOCK MARKET.
The week opened with an animated market
for local securities and fluctuations w%re nu
merous. Higher prices were paid for Mutual
Electric, Hawaiian Commercial and Alaska
Packers', while Contra Costa Water and Gaa
and Electric declined.
On Saturday the big Comstock pump waH
stopped to repair a defective pipe and the wa
ter rose twenty feet. The -market yesterday
responded by declining to suit the, occasion, as
will be seen by the list of sales. At present it
1b not a mining stock, but a pump market.
After the morning .session, however, prices be
gan to recover and were higher in the after
noon. The dally telegram from the pump was
as follows: "Water raised In shaft twenty
three feet since the pumps shut down on Sat
urday. It ie now thirty feet below the 1750
--foot level. Expect to resume pumping to-mor
row."
The official report of the operations in the
Consolidated California and Virginia mine for
tha week ending February 25 la as fellows: At
the C. and C. shaft as the water wa* lowered
below the 1750-foot ' level the shaft has been
cleaned out and reopened and part of the old
pipe removed rrom the pump compartment.
The shaft below the water is found to.be In
fair condition, requiring but few new timbers.
The lagging and centers will have to be re
moved. Work on the dynamo and electric In
stallation have been continued. 1400-foot levelâ
112 feet of the west drift has been cleaned out
-and repaired, making a total distance of 192
feet. As there is a little water running from
the hailing wall In this drift a drain and
pipe* have been provided to carry It Into the
general drainage system 'leading to the Sutro
tunnel. All machinery in good order.
In the Ophlr mine the north drift from the
old Central tunnel openings was extended nine
feet and cut Into an old west drift, which will
be ventilated and examined. It could be seen
that no moping had been done In the oil
drift and before the north drift ran Into It
there had been a decided Improvement In the
character and value of the vein, an average
sample assaying Â»2 10 In gold and two ounces
silver, while a selected sample assayed Â»4 10 in
gold and 14.2 ounces silver. The drift will be
continued In the vein- beyond the old crosscut.
On the Sutro tunnel level the work preparatory
to drifting will be completed as soon as POÂ»
--" In e 'the Union Consolidated mine thÂ« nnrth
In the Union Consolidated mine thÂ« north
drift from the top of the raise 286 feet above

In the Sierra Nevada mine the north arm,
started at a point 487 feet northwest from
the 140-foot level station of the shaft, ; was
advanced thirty feet during the week; total
length, 130 feet; fate In porphyry. On the >"*>
foot level the south drift from the top of
the rnls<* eighty feel above this level, was ad
vunced twelve reel during the week: total,

Beware of "FlannelettÂ«."
' We have received I .i:n[il'- of flannel
Â«Â«tto from a oorrf:HpondÂ»;nt who thinks it
i.;,-. â ;, luspicloufl feel." and who wishes
to know whether It contains "any dele
teiioui matter prejudicial to health. ' We
have had the sample tested, and regret
to Â«ay that bin suspicions have been veri
fied on analyfilÃ. It is loaded with chlo
rldo of zinc, and If the materiaj were
worn next the skin without washing, the
consequences would probably be serious.
The effect of this adulteration Is shown
by the report on the Birmingham case
which has created so much attention.
Some' weeks have elapsed since over sixty
men employed in clearing away the snow
In the streets were Invalided in conse
quence of skin Irritation produced by the
chloride of zinc washed out from their
overcoats and overalls. What effect flan
nelette treated with the same chemical
would have upon the delicate skin of wo
men and children we leave to the Imagi

WAR OF THE TONGUES
IN A JUSTICE COURT
THERE was confusion worse con-
founded of tongues in Justice Groez
fnger's court yesterday afternoon. In
terpreter after interpreter tried his
vocal chords to a fiddle string tension in
an effort to turn an American idea into
Japanese words, then all but splintered
his larynx twisting thoughts out of the
lacquered lingo of the Mikado into the
| picturesque phraseology of a San Fran
cisco temple of justice.
The courtroom was full of small brown
Japs, who were anxious to buck and tackle
! the syntax of the Anglo-Saxon, but who
went down before a rush of battering
English sentences. At one time Judge
! Groezinger lost himself in the mixing of
I the tongues, and three Japanese int'erpre
! ters got at one of their countrymen triced
i up in the witness box. In five questions
I they had him reduced to a state of hope
less imbecility, and in two more queries
they were unable to understand each
j other. An attorney, after complaining
bitterly of the inability of the Japs to
i handle the English language, asked the
following question:
"Who done all the talking?
The answer came back through the In
terpreter, "I done It."
The next query was of the sam,- gram
matical order:
"Was the two officers there lnr that
r Â°One witness, an ambitious student of
occidental languages, refused to be ques
tioned In his native tongife, and his Eng
lish answers were often off the track.
"it was in the hearing of the case of
Toda the Japanese procurer, slave owner
and 'dlvekeeper from Brooklyn alley,
charged with keeping Chiyo, a minor girl,
in a house of ill fame. Miss Nia Koku
Chivoâ her full nameâ was born in the
eleventh month of the fifteenth year of
the present ruler of her country, which,
by the ancient method of computing time
in Japan, makes her over IS. If Toda
could work his native Nippon calendar
over on this side of the Pacific he would
clear himself of the charge, but the Cau
casian almanac makes her 17. years 2
months old, and him a law-breaker.

Toda for Saji Francisco via Victoria, be
lieving that she was to he employed as
saleslady in his handkerchief store, and
on arriving here learned that she was de
signed for other purposes. She was
forced to dress aa a Chinese girl and en
tertain visitors of that nationality. Toda
beat her and kept her prisoner in his den
till she was rescued by Officer Kane of
the Society foi the Suppression of Vice.
]f Miss Chiyo was deceived by her coun
tryman Toda it was shown that she ia
turn deceived the United States Govern
ment by coining to these shores with an
other name on her passport. This over
sight is, however, due to the cleverness of
Toda.

A PLEASING SKETCH AT THE

"Faust" Has Been Selected for the
Opening of the Ellis Grand
. Opera Season Mon- .
, j ; day Week.
The one play In Nance O'Nell's reper
tory that she has not already presented
to us is "East Lynne" â or rather as she
describes it, the "New East Lynne" â
which will be played to-night. By all
the cannons, swords arid pistols of
theatrical enterprise this Is the piece
that should have opened the engage
ment In the California Theater last
night. There was nothing new at the
other playhouses, and why Miss O'Neil,
who was commencing another return
engagement, should have elected to- ap
pear in "Magda," a play that she was
seen in no longer ag-o than last Christ
mas week, is something that can be ex
plained only by that young actress her
self. At that time Miss O'Neil's per
formance of the title part was more or
less extensively discussed, and little
that is new may be said of It now. It
is one of her best achievements, but
like everything else that Miss O'Neil
does, It Is glaringly uneven in both
conception and execution. Just as you
are settling comfortably in the belief
that here is a new Magda, one that
thrilllngly emphasizes the big brutal

note of the character, she introduces a
motley of Rankinisms that annihilates
the life-likeness of the portrait.
There are times when she gives a
really vital identity to the central figure
in this absorbing domestic tragedy, but
there are others, many others, when her
work is nothing better than husky
melodrama, when the fine irony and
bitterness of Magda's lines are given
with the fake emotional voice and the
overdone facialism, so that, on the
whole, it is a very difficult matter to
consider the performance with serious
ness and justice. And at the same time
you feel an admiration for the good
workmanship that is displayed, even as
you resent the false schooling and hasty
temperament that keep it from being
all good workmanship. She has the
material and the mindâ you feel thatâ
and a certain amount of rough but ef
fective technique; but she lacks in that
quality of generalship which is essential
to a well proportioned characterisation.
She bolls to a fever at the slightest'
provocation, and indulges in all those
old cant tricks of playacting of which
her tutor is such a past master.
Miss O'Neil is no longer an Infant;
and certainly after this much practical
work the assurance that she may some
day be a great actress can be of no
more immediate satisfaction to her
than it is to us. The female player
has fewer years in which to attain au
thoritative art than has the male. The
player's life is brief enough at best, but
Time is doubly swift and cruel to the
women of the stage. It is with them,
so to spea.k, now or never. Miss
O'Neil is a big, strenuous, interesting
personality, who ought to be a big
artist. Sfce has improved not at all
since her first season at the Columbia;
and with her present environment it is
not likely that she will improve. With
all respect for her tutor, who is an ad
mirable man in his own life of busi
ness, I think that the principle obstacle
is too much Rankin.
Miss O'Neil will play In "EastLynne
to-nig-ht and Sunday night, "Ingomar"
Wednesday night, "The Jewess Fri
day night and "Camille" at the Satur
day matinee. On Saturday night the
bill will be "Oliver Twist," in which
play both Miss O'Neil and Mr. Rankin
are at their melodramatic best.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Columbia.
The last performance of "The Sign of
the Cross" will be given at the Columbia
Theater on Saturday night. The attrac
tion to follow next Monday evening is
Blanche Walsh and Melbourne Mac-
Dowell In Fanny Davenport's production
of Sardou's "La Tosca." Miss Walsh
will have the title role of the play, as
Scarpla. Mr. MacDowell will be seen In
a character for which he is admirably
fitted and in which he has already
achieved success.
Orpheum.
There are three new turns at the Or
pheum this week, and each In its kind is
good. Cora Tanner and Louis Massen,
players of legitimate reputation, appear
in a bright if not very ambitious sketch
entitled "My Husband's Model." The
scene is a studio where comes the wife,
thinking her husband is there under an
assumed name, and that he is pretending
to be an artist. She exchanges her streei
g-arment for others more spectacular and
greets him as the painter who occupies
the studio. He takes her to be his
â  friend's model and pretends to be the
! painter, and all works humorously In her
favor until he sees that she knows him.
whereupon he promptly says that he has
put up the whole scheme himself and
come there just to trap her. Then fol
lows the usual humorous reconciliation.
Miss Tanner and Mr. Massen are equal to
a much severer histrionic strain than this
plot calls for, and they make easy, affable
work of the "little piece. The other new
people are the four Eddys, who do a hair
raising tumbling act in which the two
women do most of the dangerous work,
and the Hulines, a pair of old-fashioned
but first-rate musical clowns.
New Comedy.
John li. Sullivan and his variety show
will do good business all of this week at
the Comedy. The next attraction is Miss
Janet Waldorf, a young Shakespearean
actress who has been making a name for
herself throughout the coast.
Alcazar.
"The Girl I Left Behind Me" promises
another big week at the Alcazar, where
it is receiving a creditable production.
The piece to follow is a farce called "A
Man With a PaatÂ£
Tivoli.
At the Tivoli last night "Madeleine, or
the Magic Kiss," entered its third and
final week. It will give way to a pro
duction of Offenbach's, "La Belle He
lene " The same comic opera has re
cently been revived in New York with
notable success.
Chutes.
To-night the sailor boys of the lowa
will attend the Chutes In a body. The
new programme in the Free Theater is
rich with novelty and new animals have
been added to the Zoo.
Sousa Concerts.
The five concerts to be given by Sousa
and his band at the Alhambra Theater,
beginning with next Friday, night, promise
to be widely attended. There are to be
three evening and two matinee perform
ances and the advance demand for seats
Indicates a strong desire on the part of
the local music-loving public. Maud
Reese Davies, soprano, and Dorothy
Hoyle. a violinist, are two of the several
soloists with the band. Seats are now on
sale at Sherman & Clay's.
Steeplechase.
Extra attractions at the Steeplechase at
Central Park for this weÂ«k are Vosmer,
! the aeronaut, who will make ascensions
at night: the London Punchinello marion
ettes and a new series of animatoscope
views.
Olympia.
The Olympia has a pleasing bill, with
Shermar and Morrlssey, old-time comedy
acrobats, the "One Lynwood," European
contortionist, and Querita Vincent, the
dancer, as leading features. These togeth
er with the best of last week's people
make up on Interesting bill.
The Ellis opera season commences two
weeks from last night. It has been.de
cided to open with that good old opener,
"Faust."
In 1900 Iceland will celebrate the nine
hundredth anniversary of the introduction
of Christianity into the island.

COMBINATION
BRIDGE OPPOSED
BY RAILROAD
Clash Over Tidal Ca
nal Structures.
CONFERENCE OF AUTHORITIES
SPANS AT HIGH STREET AND
FRUITVALE AVENUE.
Southern Pacific Company Demands
That the Government Build for
It a Separate
Bridge. â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway, Feb. 27.
There Is a clash between the Southern i
Pacific v Company and the Board of Su- j
pervisors over the proposed construction
of a combination bridge to span the Ala
meda tidal canal at Fruitvale avenue.
The Board of Supervisors last week re- :
ceived a letter from Major W. H. Heuer j
advising them that he had received orders >
from headquarters at Washington to pro- |
ceed with preliminary steps to begin op- j
erations on the proposed Government j
bridges across the tidal canal at High
street and at Fruitvale avenue, the for
mer to be a highway bridge, the other a i
railway and highway bridge combined.
The interested parties are Alameda ;
County, the city of Alameda and the j
railroad, and on Saturday last the author- i
Itiea held a conference, Mr. Curtis repre- j
eenting the railroad and announcing that j
his superiors would most certainly be op- i
posed to a combination bridge, and that j
the railroad wants a separate bridge.
The Southern Pacific Company's cross- f
ing is just west of Fruitvale avenue and ;
two bridges in that proximity would be j
impracticable, since they would interfere !
â when swung open.
The Supervisors on the other hand fa
vor the plan proposed by the Government,
and at to-day's meeting a reply, conform- i
Ing with such favorable sentiment, was i
ordered drawn and forwarded to Major \
Heuer of the EnÂ°lneer Corps. U. S. A., i
The local authorities contend that a com- j
bination bridge at Fruitvale avenue and a
carriage or highway bridge at High street
would fulfill all requirements of commerce
for many years to come. They propose, ;
too. with the consent of all parties inter
ested, to abandon a portion of Washing
ton avenue which also crosses the canal ;
and to locate a connecting road upon the
north side of the canal parallel with it to j
Fruitvale avenue, the Government to bear j
the expense of the grading, etc., which
â¢will not run over $5000, in return for the j
abandonment of the right to a bridge at â 
Washington street.
In 1576 the United States brought suit â 
to condemn the right of way for the
tidal canal, and the final decree handed
down in October, 1884, provided that the
Government shall keep in repair suitable
bridges where streets cross from Alameda .
to North Side, and at that time the court
had notice that there existed four public :
highways of the county, to wit: High !
street, Washington avenue, Fruitvale ave
nue and Park street. Since then a steel
combination bridge has been constructed j
at Park street at a cost of $40,000.
NEW HOME FOR
FABIOLA NURSES
MBS. REQTJA, PRESIDENT OF THE
INSTITUTION.
Red Cross Convalescent Home Is Now
a Part of the Big As
sociation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. ' 27.
Another institution has been added to
Fabiola, and to-day the Red Cross Sol
diers' Home became part of the respon
sibility of the Fabiola Association.
The convaieecent home for the soldiers
Is no longer needed and it has been de
cided to turn it into a training home and I
general home for nurses. No such in- j
Btitution exists in this county, and the
Increasing work at Fabiola has made it
necessary that there shall be an organ
ized effort to train, educate and supply
homes for the many nurses needed in the
Institution.
Mrs. I. L. Requa is the president of the
Nurses' Institute, and is now busily en
gaged superintending the furnishing- of i
the building. During the life of the con- |
valesceni home as a Red Cross institu- |
tion it did noble work, but now that there j
Is no .further call for its services it is
to be retained in the cause of charity.
There are scores of nurses at F'abiola
who are deprived of many comforts ' of
home life which are rightfully theirs, but
which cannot be granted them in the hos- !
pltal. There is no place for them to take \
b. vacation should they desire it, or should
they become sick, which is frequently i
the case, and the ladies have decided i
that a home for such a purpose will ma- i
terially aid the work of the hospital and
enable nurses to be better educated in
tnelr profession.
Mrs. Requa will have the new home In
readiness for its work in a few days, and
Fabiola will have reached one step nearer
perfection.
SIPHON BOTTLE SUIT.
Oakland Company Sues a Rival for
Taking Its Bottles and Wants
$5000 Damages.
OAKLAND, Feb. 27.â The Oakland Pio
neer Soda Water Company this afternoon
filed suit against Samuel J. Simons for
55000 damages.
The complaint charges Simons with
having: unlawfully taken a large quan
tity of siphon bottles belonging to plain
tiff; that Simons has been engaged In
such wrongful acts ever since June 1, 1596,
and continues at present to take plain
tiff's siphon bottles while they are in the
possession of plaintiff's patrons, where
by the plaintiff has been prevented from
properly supolving its customers to the
extent of $2000 damages; also that the
company was, by reason of defendant's
acts, compelled to purchase $3000 worth
of new bottles. The defendant is also en
gaged in the soda water business.
WILL REMAIN OPEN.
Oakland High School Granted Its
Necessary Funds.
OAKLAND, Feb. 27.â The City Council
granted the School Board $4000 to-night,
and this makes it certain that the
High School will not be closed before the
usual time.
The ordinance appropriating $50,000 for
constructing a storm sewer through Cem
etery Creek was passed over the Mayor's
veto. Those opposing It were Upton,
Kowe and Cuvellier.
The water rate matter was not brought
up, although the committee had promised
to report to-night. It is believed that the
solid six will try to avoid taking a vote
on the water rate, and that they will at
tempt to defer it until after the election,
which is to be held two weeks from to
day.
The Ellis \ r oting Machine Company was
given permission to erect a booth and
test its machine at one of the precincts
at the city election.

SEVENTY-SIX YEARS
OF HONORED LIFE
PROFESSOR JOSEPH LE CONTE.
BERKELEY, Feb. 27.â Joseph Le Conte, the venerable professor of geology
and zoology in the University of California, passed his seventy-sixth birthday
to-day. The college students, all of whom look upon him with affectionate
reverence, made the event an occasion for presenting him, in a simple yet
Impressive- way, with a beautiful tribute of their esteem.
Very appropriately Professor L<e Conte's old lecture room in South Hall had been
selected as the place for making the presentation. It was the room in which for
fo many years he has delivered, with a clearness and simplicity of style bordering
almost on the sublime, his celebrated lectures on geology and evolution, lectures
which no one who has ever been to Berkeley can forget. Willing hands had
transformed the lecture desk and blackboard into a mass of flowers, In the midst
of which were placed the tokens of remembrance offered by the whole student
body.
As the aged professor entered to conduct his class as usual President Charlefc
E Thomas of tho Associated Students stepped forward to greet him, and in a few
well chosen words tendered the students' congratulations.
Professor Le Conte was deeply moved by the simple ceremony and replied
with feeling: "Can it be any wonder that I love the University of California?
You all know that I was here at its very birth, that I consider myself one of its
fathers. 1 have seen it grow up gradually under my eyes. I have seen it reach
Its strong youth in the present day. I have given more than half of my whola
active life here. My very best energies have been expended, the best and most
productive portion of my lifeâ yes, nearly nine-tenths of all that I have done
which is visible at least has been done in connection with this our beloved uni
versity. And 1 assure you it has come to something very different not only in
majesty but in character from what I ever had reason to hope to expect.
"My heart, indeed, goes out in tho performance of my duty; my heart goes
out as well into my subject; my heart overflows my subject upon my pupilg. If
I have been at all. successful in teaching it must be on that account â that over
flow of my interestâ yes, and my affections for those whom I teach
"But how shall I account for this act of your overwhelming kindness? You
have paid me â overpaid meâ for all I have done for you. The trouble is, I know
not how to make you feel how much I appreciate this. I am simply powerless
to do anything more than to return hearty, cordial, repeated thanks."

Sheriff Rogers Makes
a Record.
t
COUNTY EXPERTS REPORT
JUSTICE LAWRENCE THE ONLY
DELINQUENT.
All Other Officials Have Done All
That the Law Requires.
Fees Are Cut
Down. #
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 27.
During 1 the past four months the coun
ty has saved $3474 because of the em
ployment of an expert. E. B. Bullock
filed his report with the Supervisors to
day, showing that there has been a
marked reduction in the fees charged by
those officials who are paid by fees and
not salaries since last fall.
In the four months from October 11 to
February 11 nearly $1000 worth of claims i
were rejected because they were dupli- j
cates of claims already paid; $2316 was j
cut from claims wherein that amount i
had been overcharged. Illegal claims
amounting to $323 were rejected.
Justice Lawrence of Brooklyn Town
ship has an explanation to make. The ex-
pert's report says:
"I have visited all the Justices of the
Peace in the county and all their affairs
are checked up to date with the exception
of Justice Lawrence of Brooklyn Town
ship. His docket does not show any fines
from April 1 to December 31 of last year.
At the same time he has paid in some
money for the Auditor. I have notified
him to send a statement o"f all fines im
posed by him during the period men
tioned last year."
The expert finds a very wide discrep
ancy between the mileage charged by
Constables and that allowed by law, in
many instances 40 per cent being over
charged by the deputies. The affairs of
the County Clerk's office and the Sher
iff's office are correct. The Superintendent
of Schools, Recorder and License Collec
tors have also kept their books in good
shape and correctly.
Sheriff Rogers is a very economical
man. according to the expert. He is al
lowed 20 cents a day to feed each pris
oner, and during the month of January
he was entitled to draw $301 for his guests.
He drew $48 less, and this amount has
been returned to the county treasury. If
all the departments were run as eco
nomically as the feeding of the prisoners
there would be a large sum saved an
nually. _________

6 in East Oakland about three months
ago. died last night from injuries sus
tained on that occasion.
Moran's back was broken in two places.
For ten weeks he was at the Receiving
Hospital, and for the past week he has

something remarkable, and on several oc
casions the doctors gave him up com
pletely. He leaves a widow and two chil
dren.
Bitten by a Monkey.
OAKLAND, Feb. 27.â A cage in which
were several monkeys was standing on
the sidewalk on Eleventh street last Fri
day, when the 10-year-old son of Nathan
Stord, living at 407 Twelfth street, in com
pany with several other small boys be
gan petting the ugly little brutes. One
ot the animals bit young Stord on the
right hand, inflicting a slight wound to
which hardly passing attention was paid.
However, blood-poisoning set in and to
night the boy's condition is critical. l>r.
Hamlin has been .-ummoned, and enter
tains grave fears that the boy may at
least lose his- hand.

Accident to Mrs. F. W. Van Sicklen.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 27.â Mrs. F. W. Van
Sicklen, wife of F. W. Van Slcklen of the
firm of Dodge. Sweeney & Co., and her
five-year-old son Horace narrowly es
caped serious injury this afternoon in a
runaway accident. Mrs. Van Sicklen and
her son were driving to Oakland in a sur
rey, and when crossing the Alice .street
bridge a team belonging to Cotton Bros^
dashed up behind them, colliding with
their carriage and crushing It to pieces.
The occupants were thrown beneath the
debris close to the heels of the runaway
team. They were in danger of being
kicked to death when some men noticed
their perilous predicament and dragged
them out of the wreck. Mrs. Van Sicklen
and her son escaped with a few bruises.
They were taken to their home, corner
Central avenue and Lafayette street, Ala
meda. Although suffering considerably
from the shock, their condition Is not se
rious. The carriage was completely
wrecked.
PAUL NEUMANN HERE.
Did Not Plead the Cause of ex-Queen
Liliuokalani at Washington.
Paul Neumann, who was Attorney Gen
eral of Hawaii under King Kalakaua, has
arrived from Washington, D. C. and Is
registered at the Palace with his wife.
Mr. Neumann denies emphatically that
he had anything to do with the presenta
tion of the claims of Liliuokalanl to the
United States Government.
"I went to Washington," said he, "on
private business, and incidentally to be
admitted to practice before the Supreme
Court of the United States, as I wished
to be the first one from the islands to
be so honored. I have been a practi
tioner since 1864 In all the courts of Cali
fornia. As far as the claims of Liliuo
kalani are concerned, I had nothing to
do with them whatever, as I do not con
sider that she has any. She may have
a claim in equity, but it' is shadowy.
When King Kamehamena ill divided the
allodial lands between himself the nobles
and the people, he established a use for
the reigning sovereign of the income of
the crown lands. If that use lapsed by
reason of the non-existence of any one
who was included under its terms the
property devoted to that use would nat
urally revert to the lineal descendants of
Kamehameha 111, of which Queen Lili
uokalanl Is not one. Her dethronement
simply made the use lapse and there
Is no beneficiary to take it.
"As to annexation, I can say that the
small minority of the natives who were â 
opposed to it are now in its favor. I con- j
fidently believe that annexation will ben- i
ertt the islands much more than it will I
the United States."
CONTESTS HIS WILL.
Lizzie B. Blizard Will Fight for Her
Brother's Estate.
Lizzie R. Blizard, a sister and only
heir of the late Eugene E. Lakemeyer,
filed a contest yesterday against the will
of her deceased brother, and prays that
the probate of the document be revoked.
Lakemeyer died in New York February
8, 1898. On August 31, 1898, an alleged
will of the deceased was filed by Mrs. A.
R. Tuckey. It was subsequently admitted
to probate, and Mrs. Tuckey was granted
letters testamentary. The contestant now
avers that the will was not entirely writ
ten by the deceased and fhat the docu
ment is not dated in accordance with the
law. Hence she asks thaf the order ad
mitting it to probate be revoked and the
estate distributed to her in accordance
with the laws of inheritance.
Reis' Case Continued.
The case of Christian Reis Jr., charged
with assault to murder in shooting Wil
liam S. Pardy about four weeks ago, was
called in Judge Mogan's court yesterday I
and by consent continued until March 13.
By that time it is expected that P.irdy
will be able to appear in court, but the
probability is that he will not appear at
all.

MURDERS HIS
PARTNER IN A
TRIVIAL ROW
Bloody Crime on Lar
kin Street.
S. BRANCOLI THE VICTIM
HE IS SHOT TWICE BY DANIEL
SCATENA.
The Police Believe That a Woman
Was the Cause of the Tragedy.
Statement of the Pris
oner.
As the result of a trivial dispute Daniel
Scatona. aged 24 years, last evening shot
and killed S. Brancoli, aped 26 years.
The men were partners in a ffuil store
at SU Larkin street. After the shooting
Bcatena sought to evade the police by
barricading himself in a room in the rear
of the fruit store. Police Officer Daniel
Lyons, on learning that Scatena was in
the store, proceeded to arrest him. Find-
Ing the door of the room in which he had
taken refuge was securely fastened Lyons
forced it open. Scatena was found
crouched in a corner, his hand resting on
his revolver. Dashing into the room the j
police officer seized the murderer and
quickly (iisarmfrt him. He was then
handcuffed and taken to the City Prison,
â where he was charged with murder.
According to Scatfna's- story he was
Standing In front of the fruit store when
two hoys passed by, one of whom was
whistling. In a few minutes Branooli
emerged from the lodginp house adjoin
ing the fruit store, and accosting Scatena
demanded to. know if he wanted him.
"What do you mean?" inquired Scatena.
"Didn't you whistle for me?" asked
Brancoli. his fare assuming an angry ex-
pression.
Scatena attempted to explain that the
whistling was done by the two boys who
had psP F '"' f l the store, and advised his
partner to return to the lodging house.
"You are 100 fresh, anyway," retorted
Brancoli: "one of us must die to-night."
Bcatena claims that Brancoli at this
juncture shook his fist under his nose and
dared him to fight. As he started to walk
away Scattna declares that Brancoli
placed his hand in his hip pocket, and,
thinking he was about to draw a revolv
WILL JACKSON
APPOINT THE
BUREAU CHIEF?
Meredith's Dismissal
Expected To- Day.
Collector Jackson said yesterday that
the letter sent from Washington last
Thursday or Friday, ordering the dismis
sal of Chinese Bureau Chief Meredith,
POSTTJM CEREAL.
Professor
George
Dawson,
Instructor of Boxing,
Chicago Athletic Ass'n
Says : â
"I almost Invariably find the first
thing which I have to. ask a new pupil
to do, is to leave off coffee. For an ex-
ercise that requires the endurance that
boxing does, it is about the worst thing
a man can drink as it makes him short
winded. Many of my pupils use the
Postum Cereal and are very much ben-
efited by it. It seems to make them
stronger and gives them greater en-
durance."
If coffee is an injury to the healthy,
ptrong, athletic, how much more must
it impair the system of the ordinary
Individual.
If Postum Cereal Food Coffee -makes
the healthy athlete stronger and gives
him greater endurance, would it not be
a benefit to you?
Postum can be assimilated by the
weakest stomach. It builds flesh, mus-
cle and strength. Try it-
Grocers sell it. '
er or knife, he whipped out his pistol and
fired three shots at him, two of which
took effect. The third bullet Passed over
his head, and as Scatena again raised the
smoking revolver the wounded man ran
along Larkin street, and when near
Geary he fell. Several citizens who were
passing at the time picked him up and
carried him to the nearest drug store
AÂ«i he was still breathing, the amou
laÂ£ee was^sent for and the unfortunate
man was hurriedly driven to the Receiv
ing Hospital. After being Plaf^ Â° n the
operating table he breathed his last.
An examination of the body by Assist
ant Police Surgeon Torney showed that
one of the bullets had taken effect in the
right shoulder, passed down and penetrat
ed the lung. The other pierced the left
side and it is supposed entered the heart.
According to the police, the shooting
was due to an attempt of Scatena to win
the affections of the Promised wife i of
Brancoli. Her namejs Blanche Hamilton
and she Is employed as a domestic at 6.1
Eddy street. She met Brancoli several
months ago and he became infatuated
a brief courtship she consented to
Frequently it Is claimed, the woman
visited the fruit store to see the object of
her inflections. Scatena, it is said, also
fell In love with her, and when his part
ner learned that he was trying to sup
plant him In her affections he swore
vengeance. A few days ago the men had
a quarrel over the woman, which result
ed in Brancoli getting the worst of it.
Scatena claims that Brancoli was jealous
of his attentions to the fair Blanche, and
was anxious for a chance to kill him.
When seen shortly after the shooting
Miss Hamilton, who is an attractive
young woman, said she was engaged to
be married to Brancoli. Amid tears she
recounted how she had met him and fell
desperately in love with him. According
to her statement, they were to be mar
ried in a short' time, the date of which
had not been set. She vigorously denied
that she was smitten with the man who
had killed her intended husband.
"It is true I frequently visited the fruit
store," she tearfully remarked, "but I did
not go to see Scatena. He always treated
me with the respect due a woman who
was engaged to his partner. Brancoli, in
my estimation, would not harm anybody,
and as his relations with Scatena were
extremely friendly I am at a loss to ac
count for the tragedy."
The police have the names of several
witnesses who corroborate Scatena's
statement that Brancoli shook his fist un
der his nose and then made a move for his
hip pocket as if to draw a weapon.
had not yet arrived, but that he expected
it to-day. He had no idea as to the iden
tity of Meredith's successor, hut he in
clined to the belief that the appointment
lay with himself.
Persons who have watched bureau mat
ters closely during the past two years
believe the Collector has no foundation
for his belief, and that a man will be
sent from Washington to tako charge of
the bureau, or that some man from San
Francisco will be appointed by the Sec
retary of the Treasury.
They instance the appointment of Dr.
Gardiner as Chinese Inspector by the
Secretary, and the fact that both Mere
dith and Jackson regard Gardiner with
unfriendly eyes. The elevation of Dr.
Gardiner from the position of interpreter
to that of inspector was made in antag
onism to the wishes of Jackson, Mere
dith and the majority of the Chinese
landing lawyers who are never tired of
singing the psalm, "L,aus Meredithi." It
is argued that if the Secretary of the
Treasury went so far as to take out of
the Collector's hands the appointment of
a subordinate in the bureau it is reason
able to infer that the same method will
be pursued in the appointment of the
chief.
Dr. Gardiner says he is not a candi
date for the position, and would not ac
cept it even if it were tendered him. He
prefers to remain on the outside to watch
the coolie brokers and slave importers
and thwart their nefarious plans. In the
meantime the coolie brokers areblanning
an attack upon the doctor. They are
preparing to accuse him of dishonesty,
bribe taking and other offenses, just as
they did in Tacoma when the doctor clev
erly succeeded in exposing the conspiracy
and confounding the bribers and the ras
cals.
Dr. Gardiner is a thorn in the side of
the perjured scoundrels and their white
allies who deal in Chinese slaves. The
Government owes to him and to Inspec
tor Lynch the exposure of many irregu
larities indicating corruption during the
administration of Chief Meredith. Until
they shall have been removed, the way
of the coolie brokers and the white crim
inals in their employment will be diffi
cult indeed.
J. J. Coffey Disbarred.
John J. Coffey, commonly called "Black
Jack" by the lawyers of this city, will
have to hunt up another means of mak
ing a living, for the Supreme Court has
revoked his license to practice the legal
profession .hereafter. The charge upon
which he was disbarred was extortion
Coffey swore out a warrant for the ar
rest of a man and instead of having the
police serve the document and arrest the
accused, Coffey told the man that unless
he paid a certain sum of money the war
rant would be served. The intended vic
tim declined to be blackmailed in such a
manner and was arrested. At the trial
the facts came to light and finally result
ed in Coffey being obliged to take down
his shingle.
A Neglectful Parent.
Three small boys, sons of "Walter Birch,
Potrero avenue, were convicted by act
ing Police Judge Barry yesterday of
stealing a lot of brass pipe from the
Chemical Works at Utah and AJameda
streets and were sent to the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society. The boys testified
that their father did not take care of
them and even refused to feed and clothe
them, and a warrant was issued for the
arrest of the father on the charge of
failure to provide. Yet Sen, who keeps
a Chinese junk store on Sixth street, near
Brannan, was also arrested yesterday by
Policeman ODea on the charge of re
ceiving stolen goods, as the boys said
4hey sold the stolen brass pipe to him.

MORE THAN EXPECTED.
Captains Stockfleth and Th wing. Will
Go to Law â Foolhardy Act of
Mate Thomas Macintosh
of the Eureka.
A Btrong northwest breeze brought quite
a fleet of coasters In yesterday. Among
them were the ships Sintram, five days
from Clallam Bay; Glory cf the Seas, six
days from Comox, and W. H. Mary, six
days from Departure Bay. It was nip
and tuck between the three all the way
down. It took the Glory of the Seas and
W. H. Macy a day to tow from Comox
and Departure Bay to Clallam Bay, so
that all three started even. They carried
a fair wind all the way down the coast,
and came In almost in a bunch.
Two moreâ the Wilna and St. Nicholasâ
came along later In the afternoon, making
five big coasters that made fast runs from
the Sound.
The steamer Czarina arrived from Pu
get Sound, and Captain Seaman reports
having spoken the sealing schooner Mer
maid. This was on February 25, in lati
tude 44 north, longitude 124 25 west. The
captain- of the sealer reported having
taken 720 skins.
The revenue cutter Rush was much
more badly damaged from her collision
with the British ship Crown of India than
was at first supposed. She lost her bow
sprit and the stem was so badly shattered
that the cutter will have to go on the dry
, dock to have a ndw one put in. The Crown
â  of India's bulwarks on the port side were
â¢ smashed in and the standing rigging con-
Biderably damaged. "The Rush must be
a wonderfully Btrong boat," said Captain
Cirkhill of the Crown of India yesterday.
"I didn't imagine that a little thing like
her drifting oown on me could do any
damage to my ship. But she did, and did
it with less damage to herself than one
would think. A couple of days' work will
repair my damages. ' ",_-.,.
The trouble between Captain Stockfieth
of the steamer Crescent City and Captain
Thwing of the 6teamer Sequoia is not yet
settled. Both steamers arrived In port
with loads of lumber for the British ship
City ot York. As the Crescent City was
going aJongside the ship the Sequoia came
along and nosed the Crescent City out into
the bay. Btockflpth was not to be beaten,
however, so he brought his vessel back to
the City of York, and sending his crew
aboard cut the lines of the Sequoia, He
then nosed that vessel out into the bay
nnd took her place, taking care, however,
to place a guard over his lines so that
the Sequoia's men could not cut them.
Now Captain Thwing has placed the mat
! ter in the hands of nis attorneys, and he
; will, if he can, make the captain of the
: < 'rfsoent City or her owners pay for his
; mined hawsers and the day lost by not
j being able to discharge. There is a niro

GUTTE HAS FRESH TROUBLE
WITH HIS "HOODOO" YACHT
Benicia Tradespeople Victimized by Boatkeeper
McEntyre.
/COMMODORE GUTTE'S ill fated
yacht Chispa is justly entitled to thÂ«
distinction of being the most pro
*"-*^ nounced "hoodoo" craft that ever
cleaved the placid waters of the bay. The
latest incident that has attracted atten
tion to the Chispa, and Incidentally the
attention of the police to Dave McEntyre,
who until last Saturday had charge of the
yacht, happened at Benicia, much to the
regret of the liquor dealers, grocery men
and livery stable proprietors of the lit
tle town.
Commodore Gutte has been extremely
unfortunate In his selection of men to
handle his yacht. When he hired McEn
tyre two month ago he thought he had
discovered a model boatman. But the
commodore was doomed to disappoint
ment, for McEntyre developed into the
slickest confidence operator who ever at
tempted to sell a gold brick.
During the early part of last week Mc-
Entyre suggested to the commodore that
it would be a good idea to send the Chispa
to Turner's shipyard, off Benicia, to be
thoroughly overhauled. The yacht need
ed a little trimming, so Mr. Gutte placed
McEntyre In charge of the yacht and sent
her up to the burg.
As soon as the Chispa arrived off Beni
cia the people of that town flocked to the
Stockfleth on his return from Crescent
Thomas Macintosh, late mate of the
schooner Eureka, did a foolhardy thing
yesterday. He borrowed a small, leaky
skiff from a 'friend and started out wjtn
his wife and five children to visit the
battle ship lowa. Once clear of the
wharves the wind and the tide took com
mand of the frail craft and swept It down
the bay. In a few minutes the woman
and children were wet to the skin with
the driving spray, and Macintosh began
to think he had gone on his last cruise.
Luckily the men on the British ship Gen
eral Roberts beard their cries for as
sistance, and lowering the ship s gig
brought them alongside. They were taken
aboard and cared for until Tommy Crow
ley, the boatman, came out with the
captain, when he took them ashore. The
skiff was taken aboard the General Rob
erta and Macintosh will go after it when
the bay is calm and there is no danger of
swamping 1 . _' TT

NO TERMINAL AT TIBURON.
California Northwestern Will Not
Combine With the Vanderbilts.
The rumors to the effect that Tiburon
i is to be made the terminal of a transcon
! tinental road are authoritatively denied
I by President A. W. Foster of the San
| Francisco and North Pacific Railway, now
i leased by the California Northwestern
road.
'These rumors." said Mr. Foster, "are
i brought up periodically, but there is do
! truth in them. Our company has lately
been making improvements at Tiburon.
Surveys of the yard have been made and
! measurements of the buildings taken, but
| the work was for the Northwestern Com
pany. There is absolutely no thought of
consolidation with any other company."
When the account was recently tel
egraphed from the East that the Van
, derbilts would build a lino from Ogden
to San Francisco to compete with the
! Southern Pacific it was said that a union
j would be> effected with the California
i Northwestern in order to gain Tiburon

McEntyre was not slow in going ashore,
where he introduced himself as the now
captain of the Chispa- He carried with
him a buckskin bag that fairly bulged
with coin. Not coin bearing the good old
stamp of Uncle Sam's mints, but souve
nir pieces from all nations on the face of
the earth, which Commodore Gutte had
spent years in collecting. McEntyre
watked into the store of a liquor merchant
with his sack of coin, and introducing
himself as the captain of the Chispa,
asked leave to stow the basr in the mer
chant's safe. The merchant thought the
bag- contained thousands of dollars, and
he advised McEntyre to deposit it in the
bank. The latter left the store and pre
tended to go to the bank and deposit the
bag. He returned a few minutes later
and told the merchant that if he would
meet city prices he (McEntyre) would
give him a large order. The merchant
rubbed his- hands in glee as he informed
the smooth pretender that he would un
dersell the city dealers. McEntyre then
gave him an order for champagne, liquor
and cigars that amounted to $263. The
goods were sent to the Chispa, and Mc-
Entyre told the merchant to wait a few
days and Mr. Gutte would be in town to
settle with him.
McEntyre invited a large number of
townspeople to visit the yacht to partake
EARNS TWO SALARIES,
BUT THE CITY SUFFERS
SILAS A. GUNST, With the. Aid of Brother Mose, Uses the
Municipality's Time for His Own Gain.
GREAT Is the pull of a Police Commissioner, particularly when that Commis
sioner's name is Moses A. Ounst.
An ordinary man has difficulty in securing a single position for himself
nowadays, but the Honorable Police Commissioner, M. A. Ounst. has no
trouble in keeping: his brother Silas in two fat jobs. One of these Is in the Justice
Clerk's office, which, being a municipal billet, of course, gives him ample liberty
to hold down the second position, his main duty being to draw his salary of $100 a
month from the City Treasurer.
The second position, while a llttla more arduous, is In keeping with the
sporting proclivities of the Gunst Commissioner, and demands at leapt four hours
of his time a day in marking tickets for one of the bookmakers at the local race
tracks.
According to a friend of Brother Silas, the latter finds the money he
draws from the city insufficient to support his family in a style equal to that of
his illustrious brother. He therefore lays aside his clerical duties promptly at 1
o'clock each day and hies himself to the race track, where he draws a second sal
ary.
Before the Police Commissioner's eifrar store under the Baldwin was closed
by fire Silas devoted "his evenings to looking after his brother's Interests there.
T'p to that time he remained at his post throughout the day and on the first

ter, and McEntyre was voted the best
captain on the bay. Every night the- lit
tle circle which McEntyre had gathered
around him visited the yacht and morning
found them lying stupidly drunk on the
decks and cabin floors of the Chispa. In
the daytime McEntyre took his favorites
out driving. He taught the livery stable
men how to write his name, and in a fen
days succeeded in running a bill of $51
and several horses to death.
On Saturday last the â¢ merchants who
had furnished McEntyre with everything
he desired became suspicious and they
telephoned to Commodore Gutte's office
In this city. McEntyre got wind of this
and decided to leave town. He packed
several cases of champagne into a wagon,
took it over to Port Costa, where he sold
them to a saloon-keeper for $50.
He then continued up the road, and It
is not likely that he will ever return to
Benicia unless brought back by the Con
stable.
McEntyre relieved Commodore Gutte of
several valuable trinkets which he aiways
kept aboard the yacht, and when seen last
night the Commodore stated that he
would report his loss to Chief Lees. The
commodore Is convinced that a "hoodoo"
flits about the Chispa, and he is looking
for a man to take charge of her who has
the reputation of being a spook exter

Sullivan Is of the opinion that Lavigne

smash the bag and fling his athletic
trainer, Arthur Walker, around the mat
as if he was a bantam, the big fellow
said: "Well, I can't see what those al
leged sporting oracles In the East can
be thinking of when they state in the
papers they write for fhat the 'Kid' is
a 'dead one' and can't punch any more.
I would like to be the editor of a paper
and have one of my employes write up a
story to the effect that the 'Kid' was a
'dead 'un.' Well, do you know what I
would do with that fellow? Biff! bang!
git! Sporting editors? Well, there are
any number of them who cannot tell the
difference between a cross-counter ajid

Smith, too, but I somehow fancy thi3

wish. I was here to see the scrap. The

before they will again see anything like
It. Smith is a terror, and" so is this boy.
Well, darn me. if I know what to think
of the go. All I can say is 'may the best
man win.' "
Sullivan gave Lavlgne a few pointers
in light dumbbell exercise, which the
"Kid" highly appreciated, and one or two
moves in pulley exercises which the cham
