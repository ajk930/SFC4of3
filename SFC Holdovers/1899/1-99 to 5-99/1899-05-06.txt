NEW YORK, May 5.â
Herald's Washington cor
respondent sends the following:
Aguinaldo's emissaries to the
American Philippine Commis
sion have formally admitted the
sovereignty of the United States
over the Philippine archipelago.
From a member of the Cabinet
I learned to-night that this ad
h'.i>- was made to- . TEr-jsident
urman at a conference held,
by him with Colonel Arguelles
and Lieutenant Bernal several
days ago. It was in reply to a
direct question put to them by
Mr. Schurman. and the character
of the answer was no doubt as
gratifying to the commission as
it is to the President.
As the result of a dispatch sent
by Mr. Schurman to-day it is the
confident expectation of the
President that the end of the re
bellion is close at hand. This re
sult will no' be obtained without
concessions, which have been
recommend* by the commis
sion, and which, by direction of
the President, will he granted.
These concessions contemplate
giving to the Filipinos a form of
government modeled after that
of the United States.
A member of the Cabinet with
whom I talked told me that the
commission had unanimously
adopted a recommendation
which was submitted to the
President in Mr. Schurman's
dispatch, providing three depart
ments for the government of the
archipelago â first, the executive
department; second, the legisla
tive department; and, third, the
judicial department.
The executive department, as
recommended by the commis
sion. is to consist of a Governor-
General, who shall have an abso
lute veto power over any acts of
the Legislature, and his Cabinet,
formed of leaders among the
Filipinos and Americans. The
legislative department will be or
ganized as a result of granting
suffrage to Filipinos having
property qualification. The

TONGA ISLANDS NOW
UNDER BRITAIN'S FLAG
KING'S CHAPEL IN THE PALACE GROUNDS AT TONGA.
by kate Mclennan.
TONGA, Friendly Islands, April 11.
â A treaty has been entered Into
between Great Britain and these
islands, but the flag of the great
nation will not be hoisted unless
Germany is nasty.
The series of events leading; up to this
conclusive bit of history making in the
little paradise of the Pacific began to
become apparent to the public about a
month ago. Until March 13 King
George Tubou II was absolute ruler of
: these fertile islands, which cover a
large area and produce an average of
' from eight to twelve thousand tons of
copra annually, and contain about 35,
-! 000 inhabitants. George Tubou as
cended the throne a few years ago,
upon the death of his great grand
j father, George Tubou I. who lived to
the age of nearly 100 years, and the lat
ter part of whose reign was cursed by
the many wars and cruelties practiced
in the name of religion during Shirley
Baker's rule as Premier.
The young King entered upon his
reign beloved by all. He is a magnifi
cent specimen of manhood and looks
every inch. a King, being f- feet 4 Inches
in height and tipping the scales
iat 320 pounds. His reign had :
been without much event until
: last December, when the Ger
i man Vice Consul arrived here from
Samoa and made a demand on this
Government for Â£25,000, the claims be
ing for debts contracted by Tongans to
German traders. Some of the accounts
i are thirty years old. After considera
tion the Government repudiated these
claims. The Consul notified the Pre-
I mier that unless the full amount were
paid, Germany would send a large war
vessel to sieze Vavau, which contains
the largest and most beautiful harbor
| among the South Sea Islands, with the
exception of that of Papeete, in Ta
hiti.
On Tuesday morning, March 7. to the
surprise of everybody, H. B. M. S. Tau
ranga made her appearance in the har
bor. The captain, coming on shore at
! once, was closeted for a couple of
hours with the King at the palace.
Then the news leaked out that the ves
sel had sailed with cabled dispatches
at a few hours' notice and had on
board Â£50,000. The King was notified
! that Great Britain considered Ger
i many's claim just, but did not propose
to let her take Vavau, or any other part
of this group, so offered to pay the
; claims and protect these little islands
that Germany is so eager to acquire.
President will be* empowered to!
appoint members of. the judiciary,
just as he will be empowered to
appoint the Governor-General. ;
What the Cabinet officer with
whom I talked regarded as the
best feature of the whole matter
was the acceptance of the com
mission's proposition by the Fili
pmo envoys. ,1 -learned that be
fore the submission of this prop
osition to them they had assert-
Ed that they did not represent
General Luna, but Aguinaldo.
It is believed the presentation of
the commission's propositions
was in compliance with a request
of the Filipinos, who desired to
know what the promises made
by the United States really
meant. The first proposition
made by them to the commission
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, MAY" 6, 1899.
â¦ KING GEORGE of Tonga 1
"Â¥ 1
The details of the agreement entered
into between King George and the
commander of the Tauranga leaked out
slowly. It is not the intention of the
British at this time to annex those
islands, comprising the Vavau, Haapi
and Tonga groups. The British and
King George have merely formed a
treaty of alliance, offensive and defen
sive, the German claims will be paid
when â¢ presented, and the Kaiser has
been checkmated in one more game of
grab in the South Seas. If he does not
like the play it is his move, British
was for an armistice, during
which the Filipinos proposed to
call together their congress and
through that body arrange for
peace. This proposition was '; re
fused without consideration.
It was then admitted, the Cab
inet officer said, that the Filipino
army was too weak to stand
against the American force,
which was greatly its superior.
Aguinaldo, the envoys de
clared, is not lighting for the in
dependence of the country so
much as for the honor of his
army, and they thought it hu
miliating that they should be
compelled to lay down their arms
without first understanding what
the United States proposed to
do with them. If the United
States persisted in overriding
the Filipinos by force Colonel
Arguelles declared the natives
would retreat to the mountains
and would continue for years a
| guerrilla warfare, which would
ibe to the great injury of the
I United States.
Mr. Schurman's communica
tion made a deep' impression
upon the Cabinet meeting to
day, and after the meeting it was
; stated that the situation' in
! Luzon, aside from its military
feature, is most encouraging. In
the instructions given to Mr.
guns will cover King George and Tonga
has been changed from an absolute
monarchy to a virtual dependency of
the world-covering empire.
Who is to be Queen of Tonga? is the
question that is on everybody's tongue
at present. The steamer has just ar
rived. ' -inging hundreds of pounds
worth of wines, jewels and medals and
decorations for a new order to be in
stituted by George Tubou the day he
is wedded. The chiefs have been called
from all the islands of this group to
cast' their vote, and that vote decides
the queen question. Ofa is the favorite
of the outside island chiefs. I
have just heard June 19 is to be the
wedding day and the festivities will
last a whole month.
Copra is coming in in great quanti
ties and now that the hurricane season
has passed without a blow this will be
a good year. Copra brings, f. o. b., $55
per ton, and when one realizes that
the old nuts simply fall from the tree
and are cut in half and the kernel dried
it is all profit.
The great money throwing festival in
the churches has just finished, girls
going up and down the aisle of the
great church carrying huge tin wash
basins,' int.) which the gentle heathen
throw's all his wealth when his name
is called out and received with shouts
of praise The basins as soon as filled
are emptied into a huge washtub at
the King's feet. This screaming and
shouting is kept up all day, till the
last cent is drawn from the poor native,
who goes home hungry to his grass hut,
with only a singlet and vala on, while
the missionary rides home to his cozy
dinner and counts at leisure the bags j
of money, no account of it being given
to any one else. Besides this annual j
money throwing each native pays a j
shilling quarterly for being allowed to j
be a member of the church. Then
there is a baby money throwing, when
mothers carry their almost naked lit- j
tie ones to the table and let them drop
in the shillings. I understand at some
of these money throwlngs as much as:
$3000 has been thrown in from one
island alone. Yet collections are going
on all over the civilized world to help
the poor missionary. If they would j
only teach the natives common sense
and how to save their money for sick
ness and how to keep their homes com
fortable it would be to their credit. In :
all my travels I find the Catholics the j
only ones who seem to train the chil
dren for useful lives. Though I do not
belong to that denomination yet I fain
would give credit where it is due.
Schurman and ; his : colleagues
they have been directed to act in
a conciliatory, manner toward
the insurgents, ; and .it is , the mas
terly way in which the commis
sion has conducted its work to
which the administration be
lieves its success is due.
Mr. Schurman did not indicate
in his dispatch- whether Colonel
Arguelles and- Lieutenant Ber
nal had returned. to Aguinaldo's
headquarters, but it is the under
standing of the President that
immediately after the receipt of
the instructions sent to-day the
commission will communicate
without delay/with the Filipino
envoys.
It has been impressed upon
the commission that before the
Filipinos are granted peace they
must lay down their arms, and
when they have taken this action
and returned to their homes
then will be put in operation the
form of government which has
been recommended by the com
mission.
The commission will no doubt
make it plain to Colonel Ar
guelles and , Lieutenant Bernal
that the President, cannot guar
antee that the form of govern
ment recommended by the com
mission shall be continued, but a
Continued on Second race.
CARNEGIE
OPPOSED TO
THE TRUSTS
Believes the Country Is on
the Verge of Political
Revolution.
SELLS OCT TO FIGHT
As a Monopolist He Could Not
Battle Against Combines and
Imperialism.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Anarew Carnegie has sold out
his great interests in the iron
trade â not because he wants to
retire from business, but because
he is opposed to trusts, which, he
believes, will lead to a political
revolution in this country in the
near future,
He is saio to oes/re, when that
j time comes, to be on the side ot
those who oppose monopoly.
PITTSBURG, -May 5. â Andrew-
ITTSBURG, May 5. â Andrew-
Carnegie's retirement from the
steel business has aroused con
siderable interest here in his old
home, but to many his decision
has caused no surprise. Carnegie viewed
with uneasiness the gradual incorpora
tion of the various iron and steel in
dustries into trusts, and anticipated the
time when his company, in self-defense,
must follow in the same line.
Mr. Carnegie believes that trusts will
yet lead to a political revolution, and
he is said not to like them. The near
est approach to one he was ever in,
the famous steel rail pool, was only a
temporary agreement as to prices be
tween business competitors. Several
weeks ago Carnegie referred somewhat
sarcastically to the modern industrial
combination, "with its trappings of pre
ferred and common stock and bonds,"
and said ,he preferred the "old-fash
ioned way" of selling iron and steel.
It is well known the famous iron
master is an anti-imperialist, and
thinks the coming Presidential cam
paign will be fought with the anti-trust
and the anti-expansion people on the
same side. As chief stockholder in the
Carnegie Company, and that company
a member of the trust monster, he
would occupy an illogical position in
the anti-trust, anti-expansion party.
By selling out his interest he will be
able to devote his time, attention and
money to his endeavor to brine about
the success of the anti-expansion prop
aganda.
To the suggestion that the hatred en
tertained toward him by union labor
may cause his advocacy of any public
question to be of doubtful utility to the
cause, his friends reply that it was not
Carnegie, but H. C. Frick. who con
ducted the Homestead strike, that his
approval of Frick's course was only a
demonstration of lor* Ity to a business
partner, and that he considers himself
really a good friend of labor.
Carnegie could not associate with any
party believing in free silver at 16 to
1, but he has confidence in himself and
expects to be able to eliminate that
troublesome question from the next
campaign. '
Indeed, the theory is advanced that
his decision to retire from the trust
threatened business field may have
been born at the famous conference
which he and W. J. Bryan held in New
York last winter. -

Southern Leaders Plotting to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex.. May s.â Democratic
leaders in the Texas Legislature are in
receipt of advices that there is an or
ganized movement on foot in all the
Southern States to down Bryan by hav
ing concerted action taken in the mat
ter of fighting the trusts. The move
ment was started in Arkansas, the
home of Chairman Jones, by the intro
duction in the Legislature of an anti
trust bill, and it is reported here that
the movement will be carried all over
the Southern States.
"The politicians in the movement, I
am told, believe that by pushing this
fight against trusts to the front they
can overshadow Bryan and his views
on silver and imperialism and can thus
relegate him to the rear. While he is
opposed to trusts, he makes it a sec
ondary consideration, and the political
leaders propose to make it one of the
great issues.
In* fact, according toÂ» information re
ceived here, the next Presidential cam
paign will find this anti-trust scheme
the main issue. i-7.- f-li" '.

APIA, April 21.âFollowing
up the line of operations
for the purpose of reliev
ing the troops of the" in
cessant worry of night
attacks, and of clearing the
rebels from the ' Immediate
, neighborhood .of the inhabited
portion of Apia, on April the
day before Easter Sunday,
H. M. S. Royalist steamed a few
miles to windward to support an
armed force under Lieutenant
Freeman, first officer of H. M. S.
Tauranga, which was to pro
ceed along the beach route as
far as Letogo village and try to
drive back a number of rebels
in the Vailele plantation. Of
late the troops at the English
and American Consulates had
been subjected to attacks by
parties of these rebels from Vai
lele. It was intended to follow
the same route on the home
ward journey, so as to be under
the guns of the Royalist all the
way. The land party was made
up as follows: Americans, 60,
including 20 marines; English,
62; total, whites 122 and about
120 natives, who were indiffer
ently armed and without discip
line.
Lieutenant Gaunt and his bri
gade were away at Savaii with
the Porpoise, else perhaps this
would never have been written.
General directions were given
by Captain Stuart, in command
of the united forces on . shore,
after a consultation with the
admiral, and Lieutenant Free
man, first officer of the Tau
ranga, was in charge of the
party. Under Freeman* were
Lieutenants Cav<- of the Por
poise and Hickmann of the.Roy
alist, and fn#m the flagship were
Lieutenant Philip V. Lansdale,
U. S. N., senior officer; Ensigns
J. R. Monaghan, U. S. N.,' and
Lieutenant Perkins, U. S. M. C.
Dr. Lung of the Philadelphia
accompanied the expedition.
The Royalist shelled Vailele
village, which was burned. The
march of the land force along
the beach was continued to Le
* togo, five miles from Apia, and
"that also was burned. The head station of the plantation is at Svga, +
perhaps less than a third of a mile from Legoto. ; U ; Â©
Here Lieutenant Cave, who was ahead of the forces, saw Captain T
Hufnagel, the German manager. He asked the manager if any Sa- ?
moans had been around in that direction. None had been near that q
day, was the manager's reply. At that very moment and within a few +.
hundred yards of the speakers were a large body of rebels. q
Hufnagel advised the return home to be made by way of the main +-
road through the plantations. Everything was quite safe, he said; no Â©
rebels had been about. Three other Germans were with Hufnagel and "*â¢*"
heard this conversation. No one gave any warning of danger. The Â©
friendlies crossed the Letogo Creek, set fire to the houses and returned q
to the bluejackets, who had waited for them just past the station house. 4
"Homeward" was the order. '5
No sooner had they got to the gate leading out of the station prem- q

ises, and only 100 yards distant from the house, than at a bend in the
road 400 yards away large numbers of rebels were seen. The Colt auto
malic gun. of which the natives have such a dread, was immediately
brought forward.' It refused to act. The rebels got off clear and a halt
was made to fix the gun, which had been assembled by the armorer only
the da*-' before. It took a half hour to do so. Lieutenant Lansdale.
under whose orders the gun then was, took a few trial shots and the
gun worked all right.
Along the road marched the troops, native friendlles first. The
Junction of beach and main plantation was reached. Misled by the
information of Hufnagel, it was decided to return by the main road.
The open space where the Germans were massacred by Mataafa was
passed and down the winding road through the Tagalu gully marched
the combined fore.-. The friendlies went straight up the western bank,
all covered with buffalo grass, while along the curving road the sailors
went at double quick. Tagalu Valley is one of the loveliest in tic* Pa
cific; steep slopes on both sides, green with buffalo grass. Here and
there on th- slopes are cocoanuts. At the bottom is a purling stream,
which Issues from a patch of brush, kept to preserve the stream, cat
tle standing up to their knees in the cool water, a couple of beautiful
date palms and a huge double mango tree in the center of the valley
complete the picture to those who know tropical life. To those who do
not there is no pictureâ the eye must see for the mind to conceive such
beauty.
On the top of the west slope, just after the last of the troops had
ascended and had begun to march through the open cocoanut planta
tion along the main road, the rebels, who had taken up a position in
land of the road, fired upon them. The line was about 300 or 400 yards in
length. Both sides of the road are fenced with barbed wire for stock
purposes. The beach runs parallel about one-half mile away. Inland
is all buffalo grass and cocoanut trees, and after a distance from the
road the land drops and a crest is formed. Behind this crest were the
rebels. Many were lying In the long grass also ; some were up cocoanut
trees and screened from view by the gigantic leaves.
The Colt gun was again brought to the foreâ again it refused to
act. Lieutenant Lansdale went to it to ,1 . what he could and was
shot in the knee and was incapable of marching afterward.
At this time, right at the beginning of the fight Lieutenant Freeman
was shot through the chest He fell dead. The friendlies, subjected to
heavy fire by a foe whom they could not see, except in a few Instances,
with no discipline and only a scanty supply of cartridges, fell into dis
order and retreated through the fence toward the beach, disorganizing
the combined forces.
The Colt automatic gun, which had not fired a single shot, was
rendered useless by taking away some of the mechanism and 3000 rounds
of ammunition belonging to the gun were scattered about the field to
prevent it falling into the hands of the rebels.
Retreat was imperative; no one of the combined force would have
lived to tell the tale If they had kept on the main toad longer. Th
rebels had gone round on the east and west sides and were firing on
three sides. Toward the sea, through barbed wire fences and heavy
vegetation of bananas and taro, was the only way of safety. With
Lansdale wounded. Freeman dead. Lieutenants Cave and Perkins and
Dj*. Lung, who had assumed command of the part*. agreed that that
was their only way. Through the scrub and grass the sailors retired.
Lansdale, assisted by men, covered part of the retreat without further
hurt.
The nature of the location split up the force into parties. The men
deployed in open order. Mutual support was Impossible. The firing by
the rebels was severe. Lansdale, who was with two men and Mon
aghan, urged them to leave him to his fate. One man was shot dead.
The other, seeing he could not save his officer, retreated and escaped.
naghan refused to go and stayed by his fellow officer. *
The next morning when the friendlies under Tamasese visited the
field both were found dead some two hundred yards apart. Mona
ghan's revolver was empty, so was Lansdale's. Between them lay three
bodies of the foe. Monaghan. before th" last man left him, shot the
chief, Aiono, dead as he was advancing on Lansdale.
Deserters from Mataafa's side relate how Monaghan. stood over
Lansdale until Lansdale was shot dead, and then tried to escape, but
was unable to do so.
The beach was reached and it was found that four men were miss
ing besides the officers, namely: Edsall and Butler from the Philadel
phia, and Long and Trout from the British ships. Dr. Lung, who had
been conspicuous for his coolness and bravery under fire, took command
of the forces of Lansdale and Monaghan and under the fire of the
Royalist the rebels fell back. On the home march reinforcements were
met coming to the rescue â all returned together. Several of the Malie
toa natives lost their lives.
Th.- decapitated bodies of the three officers were recovered on the
field next morning and later on the heads were sent Into Apia, through
the medium of Brother Phillippe of the Catholic mission, who visited
the rebel camp for that purpose. On Easter Sunday the seven dead offi
cers and men were burled in one large grave at Mulinuu. All the lead
ing American nd British officials and residents were present. Ger
mans were conspicuous by their absence, the only one present being
Pastor Margraf of the German school, who had known Lansdale in
the United States and who sent a beautiful wreath in memory of their
friendship.
The German warship Falke had her flag at half-mast and sent two
wreaths entwined with the German national colors.
The decapitated heads arrived too late fur the funeral, but not be
fore the grave was tilled. The coffins were opened and the heads of
the officers put into them. Lieutenant Freeman had his ears cut off,
besides being decapitated. The bluejackets only had their ears cut off.
In the fight there were killed on the Mataafa side forty-three and
fifty wounded; many of the latter are expected to die.

The following letter was written to the Associated Press by J. H.
Moors, an American who is noted as being an ardent sympathizer with
Mataafa.
APIA, Samoa, April 19.â Those who
believed that the war in Samoa
would come to a speedy end. and
that when the Mataafa forces
found tho warships and ail the
-modern appliances of warfare di
rected against them by tried and capa

sue for peace have Indeed been greatly
disappointed. Five weeks of continuous
activity by four modern warships, bom
bardment after bombardment, machine
gunning and assaults with Tanu support
ers armed with new Martini rifles by the
naval forces, and supplied with unlimited
ammunition, have so far been ineffective
against the supporters of the late provis

with great bravery and wonderful per
sistency.

ready been burled. These represent the
loss on the Tanu ride. As the Mataafa
men have been fighting must of the day
behind fortifications, they probably have
not suffered so much.
At 7 a. m. Lieutenant Gaunt, who has
charge of a force of 150 Tanu men. who
have been supplied with new Martinis
and somewhat drilled, marched out on
the Tlvoli road to the line of Tanu's for
tifications. A little later Tamasese and
his forces departed for the front. Prob
ably 1500 men were massed about a mile
back of Apia.
At 8 a. m. Captain Sturdee sent word
to all the whites living in the neighbor
hood of the line of lire that he was about
to bombard Vailele again. it has been
found necessary to clear out all the peo
ple, as much of the ammunition has been
found defective, and a number of painful
accidents and out death have resulted
from this cause.
The assault on the Mataafa fortification
commenced about 10:30 a. m. and the Tanu
assailants were strongly supported by de
tachments from both the Porpoise and
the Tauranga, while the Philadelphia men
guarded the consulates. No success
marked the first assault and It is
probable the bombardment was as
usual entirely ineffective. After a time a
heavy machine gun was got up on the
road and commenced to play upon' that
portion of the fort that was exposed to It.
Later it was thought an attempt might be
made to take the place if the Tanu men
could be braced up to it. The assault was
at first successful, as the Mataafa men
had been driven from that point by the
machine gun. As soon, however, as this
piece stopped work the Mataafa men ral
lied, and with a rush drove out their
â¢aemles. killing and wounding a number
and in all likelihood losing men them
selves.
The Tanu forces were compelled to re
treat precipitately and are now back in
the neighborhood of those lines they held
this morning before the fight. The bom
bardment this afternoon was for the pur
pose of again attempting to destroy the
fortifications. As they are concealed from
view and protected by a dense tropical
growth In which some of the hardwood
trees are five feet through, it is a very
difficult matter to make the least impres
sion by the use of shells. Hundreds of
these costly missiles have been hurled at
the Mataafa people by the finest guns and
the most expert crews In the world, but
up to the present there Is no record of a
single person having been killed, outside
of the marine who was hurt at the United
States Consulate on the first day of the
fighting and of which I have already writ
ten. The poor fellow has since died of his
injuries.
On the first day of this present month
the most serious fight of the war took
place at Vailele, on the very same ground
on which was formerly fought the noted
engagement between the forces of Mat la
fa and the German warships some ten
years ago, and again three of the fallen
sail were decapitated according to Sa
moan custom, and but for the timely as
sistance of one of the warships the whole
party would have been annihilated. Again
the decapitated heads were sent back to
the friends just in time for interment
with the bodies.
On Sunday, the 22d of April, the coffins
containing the remains of these gallant
; seamen were landed at Mulinuu, large
i detachments from all the ships being
present. This now makes twelve whites
who have perished in this quarrel and
have been laid to rest alongside cf
I the German victims of the Vailele fight,
â¢ which occurred ten years ago.
At 1:30 o'clock on the Ist of April the.
! Royalist moved out of the harbor to the
eastward, where some of the Mataafa
â¢ forces were known to bet located. At 2:30
'p. m. sixty British sailors and forty
! Americans, taking with them a Colt au
tomatic gun, proceeded along the beach
toward Vailele. Following them In a dis
orderly way were about 200 Tanu men.
This party was unmolested until it had
nearly crossed the Vailele plantation. At
Captain Hufnagel's drying works they
met the well-known manager and asked
if he had seen any Mataafa men about,
! and he assured the officer In charge that
â he had not. The party then started to
! return, taking a route which led them
a little more inland. They had descended
into a small ravine, which was filled with
long grass, and were about to ascend the
other side of it when from all quarters
they were met by a shower of. bullets,
several being hit. and among the number
Lieutenant Lansdale of the Philadelphia
was struck badly in the knee.
A charge was made down the ravine
and up its far side, the wounded being
carried along, and Lansdale, being
dragged through a wire fence, badly
scratched his face. An attempt was made
to drive off the natives with the automat
ic gun from this position, and it is con
tended that this might have been done
if the machine had not got jammed and
useless. From all sides bullets were com
ing, but very few natives were to be seen,
as they availed themselves of every sort
of shelter. While attending one of the
wounded the commander of the British

The natives, recovering courage when
they saw that the machine gun was out
of order, rushed a section of the British
line, chopping one chap very badly with
their long knives and getting away with
his ear. During this portion of the gam

} escaped with the rest, but he gallantly
, sacrificed his life to save his friend.
By shelling the beach behind and ahead
of them the Royalist was enabled to es
i cort the party back to Apia, but the Ma-
I taafa men could be seen dodging from
rock to rock and from tree to tree, follow-
Ing up very closely, and the last shells
which the warship threw were sent ashore
! within half a mile of Apia. During the
I whole night following this vessel laid off
i just to windward of Apia, throwing shells
to keep the Mataafa forces from attack
ing the consulates, it Is not known how
many Mataafa men were killed. One was
seen to fall out of a cocoanut tree, where
he had esconsced himself, and three dead
were found on the ground by the teach
ers, who were permitted to go out after
the bodies of the slain. It is not vet
likely, however, that these people lost
very many men, as they generally kept
j well under shelter.
On Sunday, the 2d of April, the coffins
containing the remains of the gallant sea
men were landed at Mulinuu, large de
tachments from all ships being present.
This now makes twelve whites who have
perished in this quarrel and have been
laid to rest close alongside the German
victims of the Vailele fight, which oc
: curred ten years ago.
On April 3 it was decided to again treat
the Mataafa forces to a general bom
bardment. Accordingly the Royaust and
Tauranga went to sea and lav off Mataite
and Vailele. the Royalist lay off Vaitele,
and the Philadelphia from her anchorage
commenced in good earnest senu.ng hun
j dreds of heavy shells- in all directions.
| Within a few hours news was at hand in
i town that not a single Mataafa man had
I been hit. During the firing it was no
i ticed that a number of American shells
1 burst prematurely, and since that date
' it has been the rule to give all non
: combatants time to remove from the line
of tire before operations are commenced.
The Royalist and Porpoise have been
kept very busy steaming up and down
: the coast of Upolu bombarding wherever
: they saw signs of life. Lieutenant Gaunt
of the Porpoise had been employed
ashore drilling a company of 150 natives,
who have been provided with Martini
rifles of the latest patent and abundant
! ammunition. This company has been
used a number of times in conjunction
with the warships and their armed
steam launches. Generally they would
leave here during the night and their
boats would be towed behind the man-of
: war until in the morning when they were
opposite some undefended village. Then
after a bombardment by the big ship
the steam launches would, get in close
I and speed the place with their machine
guns, after which Lieutenant Gaunt and
his rangers would land and fire the
houses, getting off safely in most In
stances. However, of late the natives
are leaving a. few picked men at home,
and the Gaunt force has been reduced in
numbers in several warm lights. On the
loth Inst, it was undertaken to treat the
town of Tuanai in that fashion, but
' ('aunt's men found themselves in a very
i bad scrape. Within a few moments after
: landing they were compelled to take shel
: ter behind some rocks along the beach.
Gaunt himself frantically blew his re
i call whistle, dropped his revolver and
' swam to the boats. When the Are slack
ened a bit Ids men were able to run for
it too They were brought back to Apia
1 by the Porpoise, and it is not likely they
' will undertake any more burnings close
i to the main line of the Mataafa forces.
On the 24th of March the Auckland
steamer brought to Apia copies of "The
Samoan Question," alittle pamphlet issued
by William Cooper, formerly Municipal
Magistrate, an able lawyer and a fair
minded man. His argument entirely sup
ports the Mataafa side of the question.
On the 28th of March a raid was made
1 from Apia on Manlani. This was headed
by Tamasese. supported by a considerable
body of sailors and a machine gun. These
people returned with one head In a bas
ket, shouting as they went along the main
street of Apia that they had three heads.
Later In the day the captain of the Tau
ranga went to Mulinuu, where Tanu
resides, and told him that if the practice
of head-cutting was again indulged in
he would order his men to kill the first
one caught doing it.
Most of the houses of white residents
who lived in the suburbs and who have
supported the Tanu side of the question
have been pillaged and their furniture de
stroyed. So far none of the houses have
been fired, although they have for weeks
been within the lines of the Mataafa war
riors.
The mail steamer which arrived from
San Francisco two weeks ago brought
news that Admiral Kautz was to Investi
gate matters here and only to use force
In case of emergency. It is not thought
' that the admiral has made any partic
: ular investigation. He was only here a
i few days when the fighting commenced,
I and during that time he did not appear to
seek any information outside of that al
, ready furnished by the British and
American Consuls.
On tho 13th of April the Haurote ar
' rived from Auckland bringing late cable
grams which stated that the Samoan
| kingship question was to be settled by
1 an International commission; that Presi
-1 dent McKinley had expressed his sorrow
I that fighting had commenced here, and
I that he had stated he had ordered Admi
ral Kautz to act in a conciliatory man
ner and to bring the war to a close with
out further fighting, if possible. The day
; upon which this news was received the
' admiral left for Pago-Pago In company
with a collier to take In fuel. The Tau
ranga, Porpoise and Royalist remained
behind at Apia. After the admiral's de
parture the Porpoise and Royalist have
been bombarding . native villages and
landing sailors to devastate the coun
try. On April 17 Captain Sturdeo person
; ally led a shore party, but the Mataafa
people avoided them. They have made
no attacks during the last fifteen days,
and have sent in word that they believed
their cause to he so just that the powers
on Investigation would grant all they
asked; that they wanted no more fight
ing, and would accept the decision of the
powers. If the admiral, who Is supposed
to be In command of this whole move
ment, has left orders to maintain the
peace, his orders have not been obeyed.
Justice Chambers still remains here,
but it is expected he will soon leave. Os
borne remains at the consulate.:" ...*:' ;
On April 19 a Mataafan fort was cap

MANILA, May s.â General Oven
shine's brigade was made last night
the object of attack by the insurgents
south of this city. Apparently the
enemy hoped to break the American
line, but the Fourth Infantry, against
which the Filipinos directed their main
fire, held firm. The Americans were
under fire for several hours. The noise
1 of the musketry caused great fright in
Ma late.
A demonstration was made by the
natives beyond San Pedro Macate dur
ing the night. The Idaho and Califor
nia outposts were engaged.
This morning General Hale, with two
battalions of the Fifty-first lowa regi
ment and a Hotchkiss gun, advanced
on San Fernando, his men Hanking the
town on the right. The Americans
were compelled to wade across two
shallow streams to reach the town.
When they approached San Fernando
they found that the main body of the
enemy had deserted that place yester
day, "fleeing northward. Only a small
garrison was left to make a defense.
When our troops were in the middle
of the second stream which they had
to cross the Filipinos opened a brisk fire
on them. If they thought to hold the
Americans in check they were wo
fully disappointed, for the lowans, with
cheers and shouts, scrambled up the
bank of the river nearest the town, and
then matters became lively for the
Filipinos.
Without a moment's hesitation the
Americans rushed the position held
by the enemy and drove them out.
Then they chased them through the
town and a mile beyond. It was simply
a footrace, in which the lightly equip
ped natives had the advantage, unless
they were halted by bullets, as many
of them were.
When our troops returned to the
town they found f,hat the churches,
convent, railroad station and several
other buildings had been burned by the
Filipinos. The town was strongly forti
fied, and if the rebels had not lost heart
they could have inflicted severe losses
on our forces before tne place was cap
tured. South of the town there was
a double line of loopholed, zigzag
trenches, the construction of which
showed good military knowledge. These
trenches could easily have been held
for a long time against superior force
if the defenders had been willing to
fight. The very fact that they were
abandoned by the main body of the in
surgents is proof of the demoralization
in the Filipino army. There were also
several Spanish blockhouses, which
could have been utilized for defense,
but, strangely enough, were put to no
use.
A Spanish prisoner, who was former
ly a principal official, was left behind
when the enemy retreated. He stated
that General Antonio Luna, the rebel
commander, was wounded in the chest
in yesterday's fighting in front of San
Tomas. He added that the Filipino
troops were completely demoralized
and had retreated in great disorder.
Later in the day General Mac Arthur
moved the remainder of his division to
San Fernando. The greater part of
the residence portion of the town is
intact. Many of the inhabitants who
fled before or with the troops left all
their household goods behind them.
General Lawton has established
headquarters at Balinag. He has sent
Colonel Summers, with two battalions
each of the Oregon and Minnesota
regiments, beyond Maasand to capture

thrown open for the spring meeting of the
Westchester Racing Association. The
chief event on to-morrow's card is the

face the starter. Nearly all have been
highly trained and some of them have al

Trials are more or less deceptive, but
Don de Oro is reported to have made the
distance in a shade under 1:41, while oth

was, however, a strong feeling at the
track to-day that the fast Western mare
Imp would be the favorite, and that the
horse that heat her would have to make
a new track record. It was generally
conceded that the race was more open

large stores which the enemy is report
ed to have near San Ildefonso.
Lawton captured at Balinag a num
ber of storehouses, which it is esti
mated contain a supply of rice sufficient
to last the army six months.
Filipino prisoners say there are many
Spaniards at San Isidro, and the main
body of the native refugees is travel
ing toward the Biacabatte mountains.
The campaign appears to be centering
in the vicinity of San Isidro. The de
struction of bridges by the insurgents
necessitates the abandonment of the
attempts to run railroad trains beyond
Calumpit, and baggage trains have
been abandoned. -
The total American losses on the
day's movements were Aye killed and
fifteen wounded, including three offi
cers.
Detailed reports of the work of Major
General Lawton's expedition show that
harder fighting took place during the
early part of this week than earlier
accounts indicated. In the attack upon
San Rafael, the American forces were
met with a heavy fire from a lame
number of rebels, who were concealed
in the jungle on all sides. It was only
the adoption of the tactics followed In
Indian fighting in the United States,
every man for himself, that saved the
division from great loss. General Law
ton, as usual, was at the head of his
line with his staff. Scott's battery de
molished a stone fronted trench at
short range.
The insurgent leaders, Gregorio and
Pio del Pilar, who had 800 men in
Balinag, retreated when General Law
ton approached the town.
Chief of Scouts Young, with eleven
men, entered Balinag ahead of the
army and rang the church bells to an
nounce that they had possession of the
city.
General Lawton, when attacking in
force outside of Balinag, saw women
and children in the rebel trenches and
sent Captain. Casey with a white flag
toward the insurgents to remove the
non-combatants. When within 500
yards of the trench two volleys were
fired at Captain Case's party.
Chief of Scouts Young, whose bravery
at Balinag was most notable, served
as an Indian scout under Major Gen
eral O. O. Howard in his campaign in
the Northwest in 1876. The work of
Young's scouts was a feature of the
expedition. On Wednesday, the 3d. the
men encountered some Filipinos beyond
Balinag and drove them until of the
150 rounds of ammunition which the
scouts carried they had only fifteen
rounds left. They were about to retire,
when Lieutenant Boyd with a troop of
the Fourth Cavalry came up with them
and chased the enemy into San Mi
guel.
There are 2000 Spanish prisoners in
the hands of the Filipinos at San Mi
guel. They are served with . 5 cents'
worth of rice daily and are compelled
to work hard on the rebel defenses.
Several hundred of the Filipinos' s
i wounded are at San Miguel.
NEW AMERICAN
BANK OF HAWAII
Will Begin Operations
Shortly. '
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU. April Colonel George
| W. Macfarlane this afternoon gave out
! the first definite details of the organiza
tion of the American Bank of Hawaii.
i Of the $300,000 of the capital allotted
| to Honolulu 5100,000 is being reserved for
; small Investors. The articles of associa
tion go forward by this mall for signa
ture by the San Francisco incorporators.
,P. N. Lillenthal will bring them back on
the next steamer, together with the requi
site capital, and immediately on his ar
rival the bank win begin business.
A site for the bank has not been select
ed yet, but several building sites are un
der consideration against a possible dcci
â  sion of the concern to have its own build
! ing.
Fifty per cent of the first issue of $500,000
j stock will be called up immediately, the
remainder in two equal assessments when
required. It is intended to keep the stock
as far as possible out of the pool of
speculation. People who can bring busi
ness to the bank and bona fide investors
will be favored.
It is expected to have the bank in opera
tion within eight or ten weeks. Until
Territorial laws are given the islands by
Congress the bank will be the fiscal agent
of the United States Government, after
ward being changed to the title and func
tions of the First National Bank of Ha
waii. A branch will be established at
Hilo forthwith, and when the business of
Maul warrants it a branch will be started
on that island. It is in contemplation also
to start a savings bank and trust com
pany as an adjunct to the American Bank
of Hawaii.
There will be no attempt to cut down
the rates of Interest or to slash into the
â¢business of other banks. It is felt here
that the rapid development of Industry
constantly increasing since annexation
is sufficient to absorb all the capital that
more than one new bank might place
I here.
The stock market has become still more
I depressed. The existing banks have prac
; tically shut down upon loans on stocks.
â  Many shares have been sold in old com
; panics and in new ones that had enjoyed

DOUGLAS WAS
IN A DILEMMA
No Escape From Breach
of Promise Suit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, May s.â The first
j action in the Connell-Douglas breach of
: promise case since the filing of the sen
sational suit a week ago was the hear
i ing before Judge Day of the Superior
! Court to-day of an argument in demur
rer by the defendant's attorneys. The
i demurrer was sustained and ten days
! given in. which to amend the complaint.
The attorney for Donald Council, the
laborer who sues Mrs. Douglas, the wife
of one of the wealthiest men of Santa
j Barbara, for breach of promise to marry,
are preparing to fight the case to the end,
and apparently the defendant and her
aged husband are every bit as deter
mined, for they have employed the best
I legal talent to be had In the city to de
fend the damage suit and fight the claim
of Connell for $20,000, the sum he thinks
; would be sufficient solace for his wound
ed heart.
It has developed to-day that by the
marriage of Millionaire - Douglas to
Louisa Reutzler, his nurse and house
keeper, tie venerable financier avoided a
'â . suit for breach of promise that would
have been probably more interesting to
: the gossips than the present one. After
Louisa tveutzler had thrown over Don

> name appeared on the records of the
County Clerk as a prospective bride, this
time to become the wife of Frederick
Douglas, the family and friends of Mr.

A lady whose identity was never known
i here induced the prospective bride to ac
company her to San Francisco, and while
there turned her adrift, saying she had
' been instructed by the Douglases to dis
charge her from the family service, as
they were dissatisfied with her. Louisa
Keutzler was too wise' to be so easily de
ceived. She returned to Santa Barbara
and immediately began proceedings to
compel Douglas either to marry her or to
! par her damages in the sum of $2d,000.
Douglas consulted her attorneys, telling
them that he was willing to marry the
; housekeeper, but that his daughter ana
sons were placing obstacles In the way
of his doing so. It is a true. maxim tnat
love will find a way. and in this, case
love assisted by two clever attorneys, did
j find means to bring about Its ends
The old millionaire and his . servant
sweetheart were quietly married one
morning and as quietly left the city for

RDNER, lhaho. May 5.-State Au
ditor Sinclair has been engaged this af
ternoon in liberating from the guards
those prisoners known to be innocent.
In the arrests at Burke last night it was
rnpossible to make very nice distinctions
tnd they took all the men they found.
About fifteen were thus liberated. There
are now in the barn used as a prison So
men.
At the Coroner s inquest this afternoon
James R. Sovereign was on the stand and
was requested to identify certain articles
which have been printed in his paper
recently. The Inquest is conducted pri
vately
The noon train to-day brought in Com
pany B. Twenty-fourth Infantry Regi
ment, colored, from Vancouver. Contrary
to expectations It was found that but
few had escaped from Burke and it is
believed that not many have left Gem.
The leaders have, however, and the of
ficers of the several unions are mostly
out of the country. The body of Cheyne.
the man murdered, will be interred to
morrow by the Knights of Pythias.
Ten companies of United States troops
numbering between 500 and 600 men are
now stationed in Shosnone County, guard
ing mining and other property. Three
companies are held at Wardner to guard
prisoners arrested for alleged participa
tion in Saturday's riot, and the other sev
en companies are stationed at Mullan,
Gem and Burke for the purpose of guard
ing all the pa-sses out of the district and
preventing the escape of those suspected
of rioting. The number of prisoners here
is constantly being increased and dimin
ished. Suspects are being brought in
from various directions, and when found
to be innocent are released immediately.
The prisoners are held In a barn near the
railroad station under a strong guard of
United States troops. They were taken
(it for an airing twice -day, when the
uard is increased to prevent a possible
outbreak. Crowds of women and children
flock about the camp m the. hope of get
ting a glimpse of husband or father who
may be among the prisoners.
The Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mine

JUSTIFIES THE KILLING
OF MASTERTON AS THE
REWARD FOR PERSECUTION
A STATEMENT was made yester
day concerning the Plumb-Mas
terton case in New York by W.
W. Britton, agent of the Phoenix
Insurance Company in this city.
Britton is the son of the late Hon.
Winchester Britton, whose name was
mentioned in the sensational epistle
made public by J. Neal Plumb after he
had slain his victim. The insurance
agent claims to be familiar with many
of the inner affairs "i Plumb's life, as
his father was the tatter's legal ad
viser, and he himself spent much time
visiting with the family. His declara
tion is calculated to disprove the
thought that Plumb's letter was the
idle rumblings of a distort mind, but
that it really contains the truth, and
that the reasons given by tin- murderer
for his deed are realities.-
Britton says that the animosity be
tween the two men was inspired at the
time of Plumb's marriage to the daugh
ter of wealthy Abram Ives, for whom
Masterton had been retained as coun
sel. Masterton looked upon Plumb as
an adventurer and fortune-seeker when
he aspired to become the husband of
the wealthy girl, he having but a com
fortable income and nothing that would
place him on a scale with the rich.
Plumb, to dispel this imputation, would
not receive one cent of his wife's money
at the time of her death and the vast
estate went over to the children, man
age,] by trustees, among whom was
Alexander Masterton. The money has
since been tied up in litigation and the
only portion of it spent was for the
maintenance ami education of the
children, and that under the supervis
ion of the trustees.
"I believe," says Britton. "that the
statement was written by an insane
man. but 1 believe that insanity was
caused by the continual hounding of
Plumb by Masterton. I believe it is
true that in life the trustee of the
estate did everything in his power to
alienate- the affections of the. children
tor their father, who was an exception
ally loving man to his family, and who
deserved their confidence and love i
remember of the instance in which mv
father detected a French maid in tin*
act of carrying petty tales out of the
family circle to Masterton. and also
that Masterton extended J. Ives Plumb

DESIRELLO IN
HIS OWN BEHALF
Young Johnston's Slayer
on the Witness-Stand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, May Interest
in the Desirello murder cast- grows
more intense as the trial proceeds. To
day the courtroom was uncomfortably
filled in anticipation of the defendant
taking the stand.
The prosecution finished its testi
mony this morning and the defense
commenced the introduction of testi
mony. The testimony presented by the
prosecution is undoubtedly very strong
against the defendant, although it is
not thought it will support a convic
tion of murder. The defense showed its
hand. Throughout the cross-examina
tion of the State's witnesses it was ap
parent that Desirello's lawyers would
hold that the horses driven by Vacari
were running away or being driven in
such a reckless manner as to endanger
the lives of any persons who might be
in their path or upon the streets, and
that to prevent injury to the parties
driving, or to other people, the defend
ant drew his revolver and shot at the
horses for the purpose of crippling
them.
One witness, a Mr. Ferger, testified
that In- was at the Baumann ranch on
the afternoon of March 18, and left
there on a wagon shortly before 1
o'clock. John Vacarl was driving:, lb.
in company with the driver and James
Johnston, drove down toward Colma to
the electric line. Vacari stopped the
team near the White House and Fer
ger got off the wagon and onto the cat
going toward the city. He testified that
he was a dealer in horses and would not
have given $25 for the two horses. It
was at this place where he got off the
wagon that Henry Jensen got on. Up
to the time Ferger left the wagon the
horses were going very slowly, being
under perfect control. The conductor
upon whose train Ferger went also tes
tified that the team Stopped at the
switch. This testimony was Introduced
to show the improbability that the
horses were running away, for, as De
sirello afterward testified, he first saw
j the horses and heard them coming
i when they were but a short distance
I from this switch.
The principal witness for the defense.
; besides Desirello, was his wife, who
' testified to their journey from Baden
: to San Francisco in. the morning, and
| their subsequent meeting at Colma,
both before and after the shooting.
She had gone to eel her husband and
found him at the White House talking
to a Mr. Murphy. She was waiting
' on the corner for him when her atten
tion was attracted by what she thought
I was a runaway. she saw her husband
i jump toward the horses and call to the
, boys to stop she saw him fire into the
air and also saw him fire two more
shots while running after the wagon
She did not recognize the boys in the
wagon, although she knew one of them
very well.
Defendant was sworn in his own be
half, and after giving an account of
his action during the day finally came
down to the time of the shooting. lb
testified that he had been at the cours
ing park all the afternoon, and some
time after C o'clock started to find a
man by the name of Murphy. He did
find him at the White House, and they
were conversing when his attention
was attracted by the noise of galloping
horses coming down the road. He sun
posed it was some one driving reck
lessly. or a runaway. As the wagon
neared the place where he was stand
ing he stepped out Into the road and
called to the parties to stop. As they
did not answer he fired a shot into the
air over their heads. When this had
no effect he thought the horses had got
beyond the control of the driver and
then he fired two shots directly at the
horses. He followed them down to
Bellls' store and heard Johnston say
he was shot. He did everything in his
power to relieve the bo***- and ordered
a doctor sent for immediately. He
said that Vacarl became troublesome,
and he told him that he was the on,.
who ..tight to have been shot. He ex
plained to the people how the shooting
occurred, telling them it was an acci
dent: that he shot to kill the horses.
He did not shoot at the boy, and. in
fact, never knew him or any of his
relatives. He never intended to injure
or murder him or any one in the wagon.
.He had no malice against any of them.

Trouble Brewing in the

dispatch from its Cape Town corre
spondent, in which it is stated that the

upon tin* Transvaal republic that it
must observe its obligations to the
Queen as the paramount power by se
curing peace and order within the re
public. A demand is made for the can
cellation of the dynamite concession

Government means that the time has
come for President Kruger to observe
the letter as well as the spirit of the

how far the demand takes the form of

Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain, for the cancella

President Kruger insists, is entitled to
its opinion as to what is best for the

A MAGNIFICENT HOTEL.
The New Hotel St. James of San Jose
Will Be an Imposing Fire-Proof
Structure and Perfect in
Its Appointments.
SAN JOSE, May 6.â San Jose is soon
to be graced with one of the most mod-
era and complete fireproof hotel struc
tures of the Western coast. Mr. David
C. Halsey, proprietor of the Hotel St.
James, has completed plans for a new
"hotel building that in point of attractive
ness of exterior and convenience .of Inte
rior arrangements can with difficulty be
surpassed. The main portion of the old
building has been demolished, and in five
months it is anticipated the new build
ing will be ready for occupancy.
The new St. James will be a five-story
! building, the framework being of iron,
the walls of brick with terra cotta finish
â¢ and the roof of tiling. The style, adopted
is of the Spanish type, now much in
vogue in California, and the erected
structure will be one of San Jose's best
architectural ornaments. The building
, will, as formerly, front on North First
street, overlooking St. James Park, and
adjoin the courthouse. During the de
molition of the old main building and
the erection of the new the business of
the St. James is being conducted in the
commodious four-story brick annex that
of Itself contains 150 rooms, and will
eventually be attached to the main build-
Ing. A large and attractive hotel office
has been fitted up in a manner that would
denote permanent occupancy, and the
dining-room, which has always been lo
cated in the annex, continues to afford
the same facilities for serving guests as
formerly. In short, the improvements be-
Ing made have not in the slightest degree
caused any interruption in the conduct
of the regular business of the hotel. Mr.
David C. Halsey, the proprietor, to whose
enterprise this Improvement is due, is
thoroughly well known to the traveling
public of California, having for a num
ber of years conducted most successfully
the Byrni Hotel of Woodland. About the
first of la-; December he assumed the
proprietorship of the Hotel St. James,
and to such a degree has his business
Increased that the additional accommo
dations now in course of erection became
necessary. The owner of the property,
Mr. James Campbell, is the well-known
capitalist of the Hawaiian Islands. He
i will spare no expense in making the new
; Hotel St. James one of the most attrac
tive and best appointed hotels of the
coast. .' :"

CROPS ARE POOR
IN WASHINGTON
Cold Weather Destroys
the Wheat.
Spwial Dispatch to The Call
Call.
TACOMA, May s.â Snowstorms in
May are very uncommon in this State.
Nevertheless it has snowed at Fern
Hill, Eatonville and in Whatcom Coun
ty during the past week, giving further
evidence that spring is at least a month
backward. It has been the coldest
spring known in the Northwest, and
crops have been greatly damaged by
the long continued cold weather. This
is especially true of the wheat crou.
in which San Francisco shippers are
especially " interested.
For several seasons past Eppinger &
Co., McNear & Co., Catton, Bell & Co.
ana other San Francisco firms have
come here for choice blue stem cargoes
for shipment to Europe and South
Africa. The present indications are that
this field will be closed to them next
fall, because blue stem wheat has been
almost entirely killed in all the wheat
districts. State Grain Commissioner
W right, who has just returned from
Eastern Washington, says farmers are
despondent over the outlook. Said he:
"In May last year wheat was knee
high and in some places was already
heading out. Now it is barely above
ground and is so weak and delicate
that the slightest bad weather affects
it most unfavorably.
"Blue stem of the choicest variety
is going to be extremely scarce. All
fall sowing was killed by late frosts
and continued cold weather. There will
be practically none of it left and the
entire crop will have to come from the
spring resowing. Owing to bad weath
er lately a good portion of the resown
crop is spoiled and only a small por
tion will ever come up. There will be
practically no blue stem this year.
"Not only will th" crop be smaller
but the acreage is considerably less.
The Big Bend district Is the only one
where the acreage will be increased.
In all other sections the acreage will
be much lessâ enough with the late
season to make the fall crop far below
the normal. I cannot estimate how
much, but it will be lower than for
many years."
Frost has badly injured the peach
orchards of Yakima and Walla Walla
counties and other fruits have been
damaged.

Santa Clara's Fine Crops.
SAN JOSE, May s.â Reports from all
parts of the- county show that the grain
crop will be the largest known in years,
the late rains having been of great bene
fit. The apricots are making a better
showing than was expected. The cherry
crop will be light, but the high prices will
make up for the shortage. Prunes will be
short, the non-irrigated lands giving the
best crop. Peaches are still holding well
and a large yield is. expected. ....

BUFFALO, N. V.. March ' s.â The
members of the" State Board of Arbi
tration and Mediation have worked
hard to-day in an endeavor to settle
the existing troubles on the docks, and
at midnight a conference is going on
at the Iroquois Hotel, at which repre
sentatives of all the interests involved
are present. hie- there is every indi
cation that Contractor Connors is will
ing to grant concessions to the strikers
in the way of advanced wages and the
removal of the saloon bosses, the strik
ers show a most unyielding spirit.
In the face of this spirit the members
of the State board feel far from en
couraged, and should no agreement
be reached at to-night's conference the
board will cease its endeavors in that
line and order a public investigation of
the whole matter.
The strike of all union men employed
on tin- docks, which was prophesied for
noon to-day, did not occur. President
McMahon of the new Scoopers' Union
said that a; the request of the State
board it was deferred twenty-four
hours.
The situation in the harbor is. if
anything, worse than last night. So far
this season eighty grain-laden boats
have arrived in port. Of this number
but twenty-five have been unloaded,
leaving fifty-five still to be handled,
with the prospect of further arrivals
during the night.
The freight boats are also beginning
to come in and there are several now at
th.- docks waiting for men to handle
their cargoes.
Traffic on the canal is threatened
with almost a complete stoppage as a
result of the strike. Boats are arriving
with freight to be unloaded and others
are waiting here for loads both of grain
and heavy freight, but men cannot be
hoi to do the work.
AMERICAN INTERESTS

j This Country Not Affected by the
| Agreement Between England

WASHINGTON, May t,.â Official assur
ances have been given to our Government '<
thai the agreement reached between
Great Britain and Russia as to spheres of
Influence in China concerns only the two
parties and that in no manner does it af
fect the interests of the United States.
â  The agreement does not amount to a seiz
; ure of the lands In China defined as being
within either of the two spheres, and
even should any territory be acquired in
China by either of the parties to this
agreement the United States, it has been
stated, will not be subject to any dis
crimination in commerce or trade. Such
rights as are now possess, in treaty
ports will continue to be enjoyed freely
by the United States.
In view of the fact that tin recent
agreement presented new and important
features, through the inclusion for the
first time In the territory subject to it
01' cities that had long been treaty ports,
this assurance -is regarded here as of the
greatest value.

French Minister of War Closes Pro-
fessor Duruy's Class in Ecole
Polytechnique.
PARIS, May 5.â M. Duruy, professor of
history in Ecole Folyteehnique, was re
cently hissed by students owing to sup
posed partisanship for Dreyfus. M. de
Freyclnet, Minister of War, accordingly
closed Professor Duruy's class. In the
Chamber of Deputies to-day M. Gouzy
questioned the Government on the sub
ject, contending that the students and not
Professor Duruy ought to be reprimanded.
M. de Freyclnet, defending his course,
said the closing of the class was merely
a measure of prudence and a common pro
cedure when disturbances occurred in
classes at school. Moreover, he added.
Professor Duruy had published articles
calculated to excite the susceptibility of
the students.
This defetise led to an uproar and M. de
Freyclnet left the tribune. It is said he
subsequently resigned, ignoring the per
suasions of Prime Minister Dupuy and
President Loubet. ' :-;*

NEW YORK. May The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
General Miles will not be relieved from
the command of the army, and no court
martials will follow the finding of the
beef court of inquiry. This positive state
ment was made to me to-night by one .it
the officials of the War Department who
is familiar with the findings of the
court. President McKinley is reviewing
the record of the court, and I understand
la- is preparing a long indorsement ap
proving the findings and commenting
upon the conclusions in a manner which
he hopes will put an end to the entire
beef controversy.
WILL BE POSTPONED.
NEW YORK; May s.â That Dr. Briggs'
ordination will not take place in the im
mediate future, if at all, is the conviction
that is gaining ground among the clergy
of the Episcopal church. The silence of
Bishop Potter is accepted as an indication
that even if he has not postponed the or
dination he is deferring action with the
expectation that Dr. Briggs will withdraw
his application or postpone it until after
his return from Europe.
Postponement is desired by both fac
tions in the church, which want more
time for consideration of the matter. It
is said, however, tnat a public protest
against his ordination will be made in
church whenever Dr. Briggs presents
himself. Such action would be almost un
precedented, and it is admitted that it
would not necessarily act as a stay of
proceedings. It would be merely a formal
declaration of war and would be followed
by a formal presentation of charges of
heresy and the demand that Dr. Briggs
be placed on trial. _

Dilatation or enlargement of the stomach is
a natural sequence of indigestion, and is a
condition that causes much suffering and dis-
tress. Thus one may understand the Import-
ance of correcting any digestive disorder as
soon as the symptoms present themselves.
People too often overlook slight stomach dis-
turbances in the hope that they will wear off.
One cannot make a more serious error than to
allow slight digestive disorders to take care
of themselves.
Besides dilated stomach, heart complications
very often arise as a result of indigestion.

SANTA RITA LAD
WHO WOULD BE A
JESSE POMEROY
SALINAS, May s.â The little town
of Santa Rita has the boss bad boy of
the State. Louie Ragio, the 14-year
old son of a prominent Spanish family,
was playing on Sunday with several
companions, among whom were David
Prader. Elrn^r. Thomas and Pearl
Thomas. The latter three had been
forbidden to associate with young Ra
gio, who was their elder by several
years, for the reason that it was gen
erally claimed in the community that
his influence over the other* boys was
demoralizing. Ragio insisted on being
allowed to join them. Th- boys ob
jected to his presence, giving the rea
son why he was not desired.
Ragio rushed off to bis home, not far
away, and soon returned with a shot
gun. Coming within a short distance
of the lads he made some insulting re
marks and then deliberately raised the
gun and fired at them. Fortunately for
the lads the gun was loaded with bird
shot. The small shot took effect about
the face and body of each. Ragio was
not the least nervous or repentant over
the result of his act. but calmly told
the boys he would teacli them a les
son, and -if that shot was not enough
he would return in short order with a
charge of buckshot and "fix them."
The District Attorney placed a charge
against Ragio and the preliminary
hearing will come up to-morrow.

OF SUBJUGATION"

swers His Critics.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CHICAGO. May s.â Professor J. Lau
rence Lauchlin of the Chicago Univer
sity, one of the speakers at last anti
expansion meeting in this city last Sun
day, has sent to the Times-Herald a
reply to the editorial criticisms of a
portion of his remarks. He says:
"The phrase used in my speech:
â¢There (in the Philippines) .the flag is
a symbol of tyranny and butchery.' has
caused more or less criticism through
out the country. I used the word
'tyranny' because the flag is there
wrongly made to represent an un-
Amorican policy of conquest. for the
subjugation of an inferior race gainst
their will by a great and powerful na
tion. 1 said 'butchery' because the in
discriminate slaughter of natives by
offensive military operations in an un
holy war of subjugation can be called
by no other name.
"I am not attacking the flag, but a
policyâ a policy which makes our hon
ored "flag stand in the Philippines for
conquest 7 and subjugation. I am more
truly loyal to the flag in demanding that
it should be used only as a symbol of
liberty than those who are willing to
Fee the flag wave as an emblem of ex
pansion and conquest. It is strange
that thoughtless intolerance can go so
far as not to distinguish between my
loyalty to the flag and my loyalty to a
policy which dishonors the flag. I wish
to be understood that I yield to no man
in my admiration of the bravery of the
men 'and the .ill of the officers in the
army and navy."
CONTRACTOR HOFFMAN
ASKS TO BE RELEASED
HONOLULU, April 28. -Victor Hoffman.
the San Francisco contractor, who was
the successful bidder for the Beretania
street school,, wants to give up the con
tract. He has written to the Government
that he does not want the contract; that
on account of the advance in the price of
lumber and other material hi cannot put
up the building for $17.9?9, as first pro
posed. He asks that his bond be can
celed and the contract be given to some
body else.
There was quite a debate in the Cabi
net meeting over th matter. President
Dole and members of the Cabinet were
quite positive that the contractor had not
acted fair. it was decided that Mr. Hoff
man shall be held up to the mark. If he
still refuses to build the house for the
amount named in his tender his bonds in
the sum of $KkX) will be declared forfeited
to the Government.
Another San Francisco man has failed
to In up to his contract. Fred P. Jones,
who took $6000 of the sewerage bonds re
cently opened, writes that his money is so
tied up in other investments that he
wishes to withdraw from the bond con
tract. Mr. Jones will be released for the
principal reason that the bonds can be
readily disposed of here to equal advan
tage. Minister I 'anion was this morning

CHILKATS LIKELY
TO GO TO WAR
Situation in Alaska Is
Serious.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Corres-ponile_.ee of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, April 28.â Th red
man's burden is becoming heavier in
Alaska owing to the encroachment of
the whites, and he is growing impatient
under it. The situation has been quite
serious at Haines Mission within the
week. Though the reported battle be
tween Canadian police and American
miners never took place at Porcupine,
a clash at arms is really imminent be
tween white men and Indians over the
making of a trail to follow the north
shore of Chilkat Inlet and river from
Haines Mission to Kluckwan, the prin
cipal Indian village of the i 'hilkat
country and the largest In Alaska. The
Chilkats have threatened mischief, and
last Sunday thoroughly cowed the
whites and threatened to force them to
abandon work on the trail.
The trail is being opened under the
auspices of the Haines .Mission Cham
ber of Commerce. The- Chilkats are,
physically and mentally, probably the
best tribe of Indians in Southeastern
Alaska, and Kluckwan, the metropolis,
has a number of two-story frame
houses which for external appearance
and size will compare favorably with
many in San Francisco. They are
owned and occupied by leading men of
the tribe.
In order to open a public trail in
Alaska a permit or charter must be
procured from the United States De
partment of the Interior. Colonel
Frank Grygla, special agent of the
Land Department, stationed in
Alaska, says so. He was at Chilkat
several weeks ago and adjusted dif
ferences between a number of Chilkats
and "Jack" Dalton, promoter of the
Dalton trail from Pyramid Harbor to
the Porcupine diggings. The Chilkats
are a fearless tribe when well stirred
up over anything. They have put
their threats in writing through their
chief, whose English name is
George Shortridge, as witness the ac
companying letter received yesterday
by Colonel Grygla. The latter consid
ers the situation very serious and will
leave on a steamer to-night for the
scene of the threatened trouble. No
Government permit for the trail in
controversy has been given. The " In
dians claim it will run through three of
their villages besides luck wan and
destroy the value of their property.
They also see it will spoil their chance
of canoeing supplies up the river, and
take away their opportunity to make
money during the opening up of the
country. This is a copy of the letter;
it has been forwarded to the Secretary
of the Interior by Colonel Grygla, who
has fully, by the last mail, acquainted
the department with the crisis:
CHILKAI Alaska,
April 23, 1599.
Dear Mr. Grygla:
We are going to say a few lines.
We are In great trouble with our white
friends They are Mr. W. W. Warne I Warren],
our pastor, and Mr. Higlnw, the discoverer of
Shorty Creek, they want to take away our
money and our work they are trying to make
a new trail. From Haines Mission by way of
("luck-nun. to the Gold fields. And the trail
will be a public trail. Rut we don't want it to
be done, because It the only work for the In
dian to freight up the River.
Mr. Warne say he will fight with us. And hi
Is going to order the solders from Dyea to pro
tected them .rom us Indian to make trouble'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 6, 1899.
CORNING CHARGED
WITH KIDNAPING
Ship Captain Arrested at
Astoria. *
Special Disrate!, to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., May The contest
betw*>n the sailor boarding house keep
ers and the captain of the British ship
Howard D. Troop is likely to be more
serious than at first anticipated,- .When
the steamer Columbia reached the
lower harbor this morning she was met
by a launch having on board Captain
Corning of the Troop and United States
Marshal Houser. Houser was armed
with a United States process issued un
der the admiralty laws by Commis
sioner Thompson of this city, directing
him to apprehend the sailors aboard
the Columbia, who had signed shipping
papers in Sr.*** Francisco for the Troop,
and to transfer them to the ship. The
steamer was taken alongside the Troop
and all but two of the sailors forcibly
delivered on board the ship. The two
missing sailors could not be discovered.
Thwarted in their attempt to hold
the men, the boarding: house people ob
tained a warrant for the arrest of Cap
tain Corning on a charge of kidnaping.
The warrant was served and the cap
tain appeared before a magistrate and
his hearing was set for to-morrow
morning. Meantime a writ of habeas
corpus was procured by an attorney
for the boarding house keepers and the
sailors were removed from the ship and
lodged in the County Jail, pending the
hearing on the writ. The attorney for
the habeas corpus petitioners say the
Bailors are American citizens, and un
der the treaty of 1892 with Great Brit
ain cannot be forced to serve on Eng
lish ships.
PORTLAND, Or., May The events
leading to the arrest of Captain Corn
ing at Astoria, to-day are described in
a communication received by the Ore
gonian from Captain Corning, in which
he says:
-
I arrived here (at Astoria) May 15, and
twelve of my sailors were induced to de
sert by the crimps promising them SS 50
per day with big opportunities to make
piles of money. These men shipped In
New York nine months ago, remained by
the ship in Hongkong, and did not want
.to leave: hut promises of big pay. stim
ulated by drinks of a questionable char
acter, were too much for Jack to stand
and he deserted for that El Dorado that
did not exist.
When our ship was loaded our crew had
been reduced from twenty-live to six
hands all told. The more men taken from
the Ips by the crimps the more there is
required to make up Ihe crew again, and
the modest sum of $100 per man was de
manded from me, a like amount for a
second mate that had been sent me from
St. John, N. 8., by the owners at an ex
pense of $>*0 for his passage; also same for
an apprentice engaged by myself from the
ship Mistley Hall. These unheard-of
prices, with ?7 50 per night charged for
a watchman which they put on hoard to
keep the men from running away, soon
swell the bill up to over $200 and I think
your readers will agree with me that this
is a high figure for simply furnishing a
crew to a ship. None of this money can
be charged as advance to the sailor; it all
comes out of the shin and is called "blood
money." I believe the sting State laws
prohibit any advance to seamen.
I objected to paying this, exorbitant
charge, in which my owners bore me out.
The boarding masters told me in a boast
ful manner that I could not get a crew
save through them,, and they have boy
cotted me ever since, although I offered
to give a reasonable amount per man
sooner than gel a crew elsewhere. Quite
a number of them have applied for a
berth, but were afraid of the crimps doing
them bodily harm, if they shipped outside
of them. I have sent to San Francisco for
a crew. * * *
I am pleased to say I have got my crew
from San Francisco, the men coming in
on the steamer Columbia this morning
and being put aboard the ship under the
protection of the United States Marshal.
D. W. C.
As soon as the Portland boarding
house men learned of Captain Corning
having ordered a crew from San Fran
cisco they sept a couple of men down
to the bay city to accompany the men
to Astoria and endeavor to induce them
to desert, In this they met with but
poor success, as twelve of the men were
put aboard the ship without difficulty.
SAN JOSE BURGLAR
CAUGHT AND IDENTIFIED
SAN JOSE, May .".âChief of Police
Kidward to-day arrested Frank Raymond
for the burglary of Architect Wolfe's res
idence on Thursday evening. There Is no
doubt as to the identity, as Raymond has
several had cuts on his head received in
his encounter with "Wolfe, who broke a
i pitcher and washbowl on the thief and
. threw him down a flight of stairs. Wolfe
has identilied the man. Raymond cannot
account for his whereabouts. He claims
he received his injuries by being hi* on
i the head by a rock when walking along
the railroad track. This is impossible
from the nature of the cuts.
Raymond is undoubtedly the "borer,"
whose career as a burglar In San
Jose for the past Aye months has
mystified the police. He always
gained entrance by boring the panel
out of the door. The first case of this
kind was at Frohm postoffice. eight miles
; from here. At that time he left a note say
ing Dunham had don., the job. This note
was dictated to Raymond to-day and he
i was made to rewrite it. His writing Was
Identical, both as to chirography and
; spelling. Since the Frohm burglary, at
least fifty places have been entered in the
same manner.
Raymond is about 25 years old. He was
employed by the San Jose Brick Com
pany and resided with his mother on Pre
vost street. His partner in the Wolfe
burglary has not ye( been captured.

ISLAND REPUBLIC
IN LAKE MICHIGAN
Captain Streeter Sets
Up a Government.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, May s.â Several years ago
a schooner Commanded and owned by
Captain W. B. Streeter was wrecked in
Lake Michigan north of this city's har
bor piers and directly opposite one of
the most fashionable residence districts
on the north shore. Sand began wash
| ing about the wreck, until to-day the
land "made" by this natural operation
amounts to IS6 acres, every acre of
which, with the expenditure of a little
money, can be made available for resi
dence or. business purposes and worth
thousands of dollars.
Streeter, who lost everything but his
life and his wife in the storm which
wrecked his schooner, "squatted" on
the shore in the vicinity, and when the
wreck became 'firmly embedded in the
sand moved into the old hulk and lived
by fishing. As the land continued to
grow, fashionable residents on the lake
shore drive who owned abutting prop
erty claimed the new-made land under
riparian rights and attempted to oust
Streeter. He fought them in the courts
and won.
A few days ago he conceived the idea
of setting up a government on his land
independent of Uncle Sam and an
nounced that on May. 5 the government
of the independent republic of
the district of Lake Michigan
would lie proclaimed. The pro
clamation was issued to-day accord
ing to programme and a flag, which is
a modification of. the American stars
and snipes, was hoisted oyer Streeter's
old schooner, the cabin of which still is
above ground and occupied by Streeter
as a home and now as his capitol. A
.Supreme Court was also set up, with
judge, clerk and marshals.
While the court was holding its in
itial sitting Deputy United States Mar
shal Patterson attempted to learn what
Streeter meant by setting up an inde
pendent government, but instead of
learning he was incontinently hustled
off and told not to return. He rushed
back to the Federal building and re
ported the assault made upon him, but
after referring to the statutes it was
found nothing could be done to Streeter
as no existing laws provided govern
ment of any territory not in existence
when the laws were made and they
can be made to apply only by act of
Congress.
Captain or . I've. idem (Streeter says
he will appoint a Minister to the United
States to-morrow, who will at once
take steps to have the new Govern
ment recognized and will draw up the
necessary treaties.
The who case is a strange one and
ought to furnish the plot for a rattling
comic opera or one of Hope's novels.
POLICE WILL RAID
STREETER'S REPUBLIC
CHICAGO, May 6.â At 3 o'clock this
(Saturday) morning 100 police were or
dered to take possession of Captain
Streeter*s "District of Lake Michigan."
Streeter has about fifty hobos, includ
ing his justice of the supreme court,
marshals, etc., all of whom are armed
' and ready to repel invasion by the po
lice or any other power. It 'is feared
Mood will be shed. No advance will be
made until daylight. The police say
the time has come when Streeter, who
has been a nuisance ever, since the
wrecking of his boat, must be abated.
This latest move on the part of the
city is said to have been taken at the
ruggestlon of the United States Mar
shal, who did not like the manner in
which his deputy was treated yester
day, and who appealed to the city au
thority s.
i YOUNG KEEPS THE GEM. j
Mrs. Truman Fails to Recover Her
Famous White Diamond.
LOS ANGELES, May s.â Mrs. Ben C.
Truman, wife of the prospective Paris '
Commissioner and the well-known writer,
will not, if she decides to visit the gay
French capital, wear the famous white
diamond that has been the pride of the
family for many years. Many months!
ago the Truman residence was invaded
I by thieves, who 'obtained, among other
' valuables, the celebrated sparkler. â¢ Pri- ;
vate and official detectives sought to re- :
cover the jewel, but all their efforts have
failed. When all hoi of recovery had
been abandoned information came to Mrs.
Truman that a cigar-dealer named
Charles Young had purchased a diamond
that to all appearances resembled the
stolen gem.. ".â ..:-
Suit was instituted for the restoration
of the jewel. This morning Judge York
awarded the diamond to Young, and as
sessed the costs to the defendant, on the
plea that Young had used due care not
\ to purchase stolen property by consult
ing the police before he paid the seller
the price demanded, .and thai the Tru- |
mans could not to the satisfaction of L _.e
court identify the property In evidence.

McPartland did most of the leading

His Words Will Inspire Faith to Try

Paine's Celery Compound.
Who will doubt the wonderful efficacy
of Paine's celery compound in the face of
the following indorsement from the Bish-
op of the diocese of Burlington?
Wells, Richardson & Co.: ;;
Gentlemen: I have been asked why
I recommend Paine's celery compound,
and I desire to put on record frankly my
reasons for this Indorsement, hoping that
my words may inspire those readers who
need health and strength, with faith to
try Paine's celery compound and prove
to themselves Its worth.
At the Fanny Allen Hospital, an insti-
tution in which I am deeply interested,
Paine's celery compound has been used
successfully.

READY FOR FREIGHT
BY JULY IST
SANTA FE WILL BE OPEN FOR
VALLEY BUSINESS.
Will Have No Traffic With This City
Until Some Time in No
vember.
A dispatch received in this city from
Los Angeles on Thursday morning
brought the cheerful announcement to the
business fraternity that on the Ist of July
the Santa Fe Railroad would begin re
ceiving Eastern freight for San Francisco
and intermediate points. The telegram
was misleading to the extent that the
Santa Fe will begin receiving freight on
that date for Stockton and valley points
only, instead of through freight to San
Francisco.
By tl!e Ist- the Santa Fe's system as far
as the valley metropolis will be complete
and in. operation, * but it will be some
months later before the track is laid be
tween Stockton and Point Richmond, on
the other side of the bay. It will be some
months later still before the Union Iron
Works will have completed the big ferry
boat that is to ply between that point and
Spear street wharf.
. Chief Engineer Story said yesterday
that he could not fix a dale for the com
pletion of the Stockton section of the
road, but that it would be not earlier than
November 1. Once the track is laid, how
ever, the company will not wait on the
completion of the ferry, as there are any
number of servlcable boats now round
the bay that can be pressed into service,
and this probably will he done.
A limited amount of freight could of
course be brought to this city from Stock
ton by the river boats now being operated
by the Valley line, but not a sufficient
volume could be handle,! to warrant the
company announcing through traffic to
San Francisco.
It is said that Traffic Manager Bissell
who is still In the East, has practically
finished satisfactory arrangements for In
terchange of business with the Southern
Pacific, but nothing of the deal will be*
made public until he returns. He is ex
pected back next week,

HAWAII'S SUGAR CRO_-\
John Ena Says It Will Be the Great-
est on Record.
John Ena, a wealthy resident of |i,,.
nolulu ami vice president of the Inter
island Steam Navigation Company of Ha
waii, arrived on the Moana with his fam
ily and has engaged apartments at the
California.
Mr. Ena denied the published reports
that he was leaving the islands with the
intention of locating permanently In Mex
ico.
"It is true." said Mr. Ena in an inter
view "that I am going to Mexico with
my family, but only with the desire of
benefiting our health. 1 will remain sev
eral months on the peninsula, or what is
called Old Mexico, and if the climate does
not agree with us we will go somewhere
else.
"Incidentally I may make some invest
ments in mining lands or other Interest
paying properties. We will assuredly re
turn to Honolulu, as mv holdings are cen
tered there, and I would not care to jeop
ardize them by leaving.
"Everything is booming now at the isl
ands, especially sugar stocks. We will
have the largest crop of sugar this year
we ever had. 1 cannot say as much for
coffee, which is a failure? at least
on the Hilo side. The coffee planters
have sold their lands to a syndicate,
which will start sugar to growing on
them.
"The natives in Hawaii are anxious for
a territorial form of government. No
body wants the country to be a colony.
When the latter question was mooted it
met with the strongest opposition. The
Dative population is now practical! as
quiescent .on the annexation proposition,
hut is' extremely desirous that the pol-
Icy of the United States be to establish
a territorial form of government in Ha
waii."

â â¦-
United States District Attorney
Coombs Will Ask the Court
to Fix the Date of the
Trial.
Osca M. Welburn,, no longer seeking)
o hide his identity under the name of J
Olin H. Bedell, or beneath the garb of a
private In the regular army, will be ar
raigned at 11 o'clock this morning in the ,
United States District Court on an in- i
dictment found shortly after his dlsap- '
tjsarahce from this city. In each of the:
â¢hirty-one punts the indictment contains!
he is charged with failure to turn over to j
the Federal Government moneys collected
by him while acting as its disbursing |
jeni at this Int. At the conclusion of :
th< arraignment United States District
;: . Coombs will ask the court to set
thi il ;<â¢ ot trial. The prisoner will prob- '
ably b< represented by Frank 11. Gould
and Gavin McNab, who successfully de
â¢ â â :.]â  d him in a former trial.
The wife and son of the prisoner called
on him early yesterday morning at the
County Jail. He took no pains to conceal
his joy at the meeting, and from that time â 
on made no pretense that he was other
than the ex-Revenue Collector for whom
the authorities had been looking for a
year and a half. During the day, while
the son was seeking sureties to go on the
h m of his father, a number of former
acquaintances of the accused called at
the lil and chatted with Welburn. He
returned their hand grasps, but did not ;
. vlnce much of a disposition to talk.
Later in the day he requested Chief
Jailer Ford to refuse cajlers. saving that
he did not desire to talk about himself or ,
his case.
It was said yesterday that Welburn's
enly idea in denying his identity was a
desire to prevent the news of his arrest
leaching his family before he could com- :
municate it himself. Any hope he may I
have had of keeping up the deception
would appear, under the circumstances
a certain indication that he was as unbal
anced as his attorneys, in their answer
n.ed in the Circuit Court, have declared
he was. A score of witnesses stood ready
to swear that he was the man. and in ad
dition among his effects at the Presidio
wen- found a photograph of Mrs. Welburn :
and a rough diary of his wanderings dur
ing the months he was a fugitive from
justice. \\ hen Deputy Marshal Moffitt
drew forth the photograph from Wel
burn s valise the prisoner said:
"That's Strong's"â Strong being his tent -
mate. Mofhtt. who knew the features ot
Mrs. a Welburn; replied: 'Why. Welburn I
you know that's your wife's photo."
The diary, which is in the possession of!
Marshall Shine, was a..*,', round in the
valise. It is an irregular .-on of record, j
Kept without system and full of figures !
that mystify the authorities; although ;
they are taken to stand for sums earned
by the fugitive under the dates under
which they were entered. One portion of :
the diary is more intelligible and tells the j
story of the straits to which Welburn
was put in his search for the wherewithal
to keep body and soul - 'her while dee- !
ing from the law. For several months it I
shows that the ex-Revenue Collector who i
had lavished thousands in this city in j
politics and pleasure was reduced to work
on the docks as a longshoreman.
The scene of this servitude was Galves- j
ton harbor and the work that of loading
grain and sugar into ships-the hardest
kind of labor, among the most uncouth
lot of men. It was a range reversal of
condition, but. if the entries in the diary
are not fictions, the former Revenue Col
lector did it day after day. holding up his
end with the best of them, herding at :
night maybe with the worst of them. The
change to soldiering must have been a re
lief to such a man. for even though it
forced him into a corner where he might
suffer arrest it allowed him some let up
from unaccustomed toll and offered the'
chance of a new land and a new start on I
the road to prosperity he had missed in
this city.
Welburn can attribute his arrest to his
own sheer carelessness, the wonder of It
all being that he did not fall into ' the
hands of the authorities several days be- I
fore he did. Tin- minute he reached the
city a .ruing to see his family took
possession of him. In the interest of temp
orary safety and the hope of future re
union he suppressed the feeling for sev
eral days. It finally proved too much for 1
him. and last Sunday night, according to
his son, the fugitive visited the family
residence on Fulton street. The boy did I
not at first recognize his father in the i
blue-coated man who claimed that rela- â 
tion. There was a tearful reunion in the I
home that night, at the conclusion of
which the hunted man stole silently away
in the shadows to the camp, where he re
mained until his arrest on Thursday.
CHARGED WITH KIDNAPING.
Mr. and Mrs. Antone Hess Arrested
on a Warrant From San Jose.
Antone Hess and his wife, [da M. Hess.
were arrested yesterday afternoon by De
tectives Reynolds and Dinan on a warrant
from San Jose charging them with kid
naping Ruby Johnston, a girl 1.". years of
age. The .chaining witness is Mrs.
Euphemia M Elhannon. the girl's aunt.
Mrs Hess is a cousin of 'he girl and
was awarded her guardianship in 1887.
The girl remained with her until about
eighteen months ago, when she was
placed in a convent in San Jose to be ed
ucated, l.nder the laws of this State a
guardian must be a property owner, and
Mrs Hess not having that requirement
was compelled in a suit to relinquish the
guardianship of the girl, and her aunt
was appointed guardian.
The girl met Mrs. Hess in San Jose
April _:.. and expressing a desire to be
with her again, came on to this city with
Mrs. Hess and her husband. Mrs. Hess
intends to fight the case.

BUCKLEY DECLARES HIS
POLITICAL PROGRAMME
County Committee to Be Chosen From
Rapidly Organized Precincts,
The Returning. Boss, Who Is Boldly Mustering His
Forces, Talks in an Interesting Way of the Chaos
in Democracy and of Other Things.
Christopher A. Buckley has boldly re
turned to the fields of San Francisco pol
itics in a critical political time, estab
lished headquarters on Market street,
openly announced his intention of taking
a hand and seeking for himself and
friends the control of the local Demo
cratic party and has, with characteristic
energy and method, actively begun the
work of organizing followers throughout
the city.
Buckley has already . formulated a
thorough scheme of organization. This
scheme is now being carried out and in
CHRISTOPHER A. BUCKLEY.
From a Photograph Made by Thors 1. a.-; Monday.
a short time there will be created a new â 
local Democratic committee, large in
numbers, which will represent every pri
mary precinct in the city and which will
direct a campaign tor the capture of the
municipal convention.
It is well known that Boss Buckley has
quietly played a hand in each election
here for some years since he was deposed
from power, but it has always been done
under -e'er of the plea that he was j
merely "advising his friends." He does |
not now think it necessary to put forth
such a subterfuge. On the contrary, he |
says in effect, "I've taken my coat off j
again, boys," and his followers are being
mustered from the Potrero to North |
Beach with the cry, "Buck has come j
back! He's got the works!"
Buckley is going to cut a large figure In
the hot and interesting Democratic cam
paign that is now forming amid such
mystery. Of course, some other people
will cut large figures, more or less, too.
There's James' D. Phelan, with as pretty
a. tight as on,- could wish to see on his i
hands. There's the Examiner, which cuts )
so large a figure in the now uncertain cal
culations of many Democrats anil which I
expects and proposes to do what it can |
toward running the machine. There's
Tarpey, manager of tin- Hearst estate,
who will be back from Mexico and seeing
people long before the campaign is over. i
There's Harbor Commissioner Harney, j
chairman of the Democratic "Four Hun- j
dred and Fifty" committee that was prac
tically snuffed out at its last row, and
John F McGovern, its secretary. Then !
there's Sam Rainey waddling around the
political pond with much motion and little
sound. Rainey is looking after the pros
pects of the Fire Department under the
new charter; Chief Sullivan et al. may be
all right, whoever loses. The Committee
of One Hundred, the regular county com
mittee, which is threatened with the Hee
ney appeal, the old Tarpey resolution and
some other things before the State Com
mittee, cuts a figure, but a comparatively
small on-- because of the primary law.
There will be - no row over the Committee
of One Hundred except on the matter of )
apportioning municipal convention dele
gates, and this committee is likely to act
discreetly and keep the peace.
Mr. Phelan and his fight for the Mayor
alty are discussed just now as much as
any other feature of the Inchoate cam
paign, and politicians wonder how Phelan
stands and how he is going to stand with j
this and that influence and faction.
It is amid Hi--- party uncertainty that
Chris Buckley suddenly looms up and 1
boldly begins the first organized effort of j
the campaign. Many Democrats surmise
that Mr. Buckley knew what he thought
he was doing before he started in, and
that he had effected strong combina- !â¢
tions and secured the backing of strong i
influences in advance. There is consid- â¢
erable speculation as to whether or not j
one of the Influences behind him is the I
Examiner, which has avoided even- giving I
briefly the news that Buckley had opened j
fine Democratic headquarters in the Bald
win Annex and was whooping up politics j
day and night. Politicians observe that
the Examiner has shouted no warning
cries about either Buckley or Rainey.
Mixed up with these observations are fre
qleni speculations as to whether or not '
a prominent Examiner man will become [
chairman of the Police Commission under
the new charter, and' Lieutenant Esola i
Chief of police. 'â â " -v.*.^ â -'-_â .'â 
'litis Buckley may be found every
afternoon and evening enthroned in one
of the two very nice suites on the first
upper floor of the Baldwin Annex, hired
for the campaign. The "Old Guard"
flocks there in greater numbers every day. !
Those who come to see him and those who
frequent the ouarters would make quite
a long roll. Those who see him elsewhere
on the quiet would make another roll. ,

' ion, the young hero of many a .Buckley

.more of the old ward politicians of "other .
days" are daily callers.
Mr. Buckley talked yesterday About his !
programme, and expressed some opinions
about other political things of current
, importance, What he was pleased to say
! for publication was in effect as follows:
"I am here doing what every citizen
ought to doâ take an interest in politics.
"Now, I find that affairs here are poli
tically in an inchoate State. It reminds
me of the situation in 1882. Then, if you
remember, the municipality was in debt
and there had been a mismanagement of
public affairs. The Board of Trade, the
Chamber of Commerce and other bodies
proposed issuing bonds for $500,000 to pay
the city's debts, and all that sort of
thing; but that came to nothing. At that
time the Democrats were entirely reor
ganized by a committee of fifty chosen
by the State and County Central commit
tees. From that committee emanated a
system of clubs, known as tin 'Forty
seven District Clubs/ These clubs elected
delegates to .1 convention in Union Hall,
and that convention nominated a suc
cessful ticket, including Washington Bart
lett for Mayor and John Sullivan, Captain
James McDonald, J. Henley Smith, E. B.
Pond, Fleet I-'. Strother, Thomas Ash
worth and others for Supervisors.
"They took office in January, 1883. They
compromised some litigation with corpo
rations, and the first year they built
some schoolhouses, etc.. and ran the gov
ernment within a one-dollar limit. The
second year they built more schoolhouses.
ran the government for 97". cents and
left $200,000 in the treasury.
"I believe that if the citizens would
take advantage of the opportunity now
offered and go to the primaries this rec
ord could be repeated by the city govern
ment. It could possibly be done by either
party, but surely by the Democratic par
ty. At that election James J. Flynn was
elected County Clerk on a pledge to run
the office for $6000 a month, and he did
It. He told me that he could run it for
$5000 by cutting off tin dead weight which
every office has got to carry, more or
less.'
"This, in my opinion, is what the citi
zens want now, and they can have it if
they will go to the primaries and elect
representative men to both conventions
an, hold the parti. responsible. The
conventions will, in turn, elect county
committees that will see that pledges are
'"Now the aim and object of myself and
the friends associated with me will be
to repeat the government from isÂ».j to
18S5 Whatever Individuals are nom
inated, the convention will adopt a plat
form and create a committee that will see
it carried out. ._Â»__Â«.
"We propose to organize for the purpose
of running a ticket for municipal conven
tion delegates at the primary election.
There will Ik- an organization in each As
sembly district and also an auxiliary club
in each primary election precinct. When
these precinct clubs are organized they
will each elect one or more delegates to a
general city committee, which will gov
ern the campaign. It is not yet known
lust how large this committee will be.
This will be done within thirty days. In
my opinion this will be the strongest Dem
ocratic organization San Francisfco ever
had As to how the plan is working, all
1 can say is that 'the work goes bravely
on' and the progress is something aston
ishing even to me. and you know I have
seen organizing done before.
"What figure will the Committee of One
Hundred cut? you ask. Under the Strat
ton primary law. which, by th.- way. is
the- best thing this municipality ever se
cured, the duties of till party governing
bodies are purely ministerial. They must
apportion delegates, determine the num
ber,-stipulate how elected, file certificates,
etc. . , .-. --, '- -,
- "In mv opinion i* will make no particu
lar difference whether delegates are elect
ed by precincts, by districts or at large.
ii, course. If they are elected at large;
they will represent one element of the
party, which is not Democratic. By
either of the other plans there would be
minority representation and It is always
best to respect, the minority. But as far
as we are concerned I think now it is
immaterial.
"As to the general political effect of
the primary law. I think that for one
thing It will dissipate a crowd of 'leaders'
who claim to be leaders In all parties. It
will stop a lot of fellows who are always
In office, no matter which party wins. If
the Democratic organization 1 am con
nected with Is successful we will do away
with all that.
"No, I don't think the law will work
here as It did in Stockton by letting one
party with no fight on its hands help out
a faction of an opposite party. In San
Francisco there will be such violent con
tentions in all the districts in all the par
ties that there will be little room for such
combinations. Nobody will have many
votes to spare for such plays at the pri
maries, in my opinion. The conditions
have entirely changed. There was no le
gal election before. Now one man has
one vote. The delegates to the convention
select the committee to govern the party
and all .other committees go out of ex
istence. The party is governed through
the primary. The people have the power
in their own hands. The question is,
Will they exercise it? If they will they
have a great opportunity. If there is a
machine it will be created by the people.
"The Rickard law? Well, it is in vogue
In several other States. It's a new thing,
and we'll have to try it before talking
about it too much. It undoubtedly sup
plements the primary law in strengthen
ing party organizations.
"I am a progressive man and I believe
the city ought to be improved. I believe
that the city ought to own its own gas
and water works. The city should be
sewered and its pavements improved. I
believe that if there was a fair assess
ment of property the city could be run on
the dollar limit and all necessary im
provements made. Of course the dollar
limit is meant to pay the running ex- !
penses and all charges for the sinking
fund required by any issue of bonds
would be supposed to require an additional
levy. I believe the new charter a good
thing, and I helped to. adopt it. The local
Democracy is in a chaotic state at this
moment, but, my dear sir. don't forget i
that this is a Democratic year."
Such is the present political appearance I
of Christopher* Buckley as he mounts
the saddle, and such is the outward ap
pearance of his policy.
HOW IT HAPPENS
THAT BASSETT
IS A CANDIDATE
Would Be Shipping
Commissioner.
! Colonel F. S. Chadbourne has taken his j
' credentials Into court, asking for a judl- i
I cial order to grab the seat in the State
i Board of Harbor Commissioners now oc
} cupied by Rudolph Herold. Should the
| colonel be placed on the witness stand
â  to tell the true story of his- appointment j
j the narrative would be decidedly inter- j
j est ing. There is scarcely the shadow of
< doubt that Chadbourne was slated for the
; office of president of the Board of llar
i bor Commissioners, the place which is
! now filled by Paris Kilburn, but in a
i shuffling or juggling which occurred at
Sacramento when the "organization" was i
I conducting politics in the way the In-
I diana man kept hotel, the name of Kil
j burn was substituted for that of Chad-
I bourne.
I In 1898 it was planned thai KUburn
I should have a Federal office as soon as
j Ids term as State Bank Commissioner ex
j pired. Just as it was programmed years
| before that he should have a State office
| when his career in the Federal office of
| Surveyor of the Port was ended. The of
j flee staked out for Kllburn was that of
j United States Shipping Commissioner.
The Call derived information at Sacra
mento that Mark Hanna had been con
! sulted as to the advisability of appoint
! ing Kilburn. but it could not be ascer
! tamed that Senator Perkins was enthusi-.
i astic .in supporting the claims of the ap
plicant. The fact was not disputed that
; Kilburn was in the Mexican Senatorial
â  corral giving comfort if not aid to Burns.
No doubt Senator Perkins was apprised
through the friends of U. S. Grant where
! Kilburn could lie found. When it became
- obvious to the organization that Hanna
' could not or would not advise the Presi
dent to appoint Kilburn Shipping Com
' missioner unless Senator Perkins urged
j the appointment, it was decided to slate
I Palis for the tirsÂ» vacancy in the State
I Board of Harbor Commissioners and to
give Colonel Chadbourne a beautiful gold
I brick. The programme was carried out.
| Kilburn got an office and Chadbourne re
â  ceived a commission entitling him to the
I possession of a first-class lawsuit.
i The foregoing arrangement disposed of
! Kilburn and Chadbourne, but it left
Charles Basset I without immediate pros*:
i pect of remunerative employment as an
I office-holder. Bassett is not unknown to
State politics. He discovered 11. H.
! Markham of Pasadena and no one seeks
! to deprive him of the distinction belong
' ing to the discovery. He was not slow
to discover that Henry T. Gage stood
- a fine chance of winning the nomination
I for Governor in the Republican State
i convention last summer, and he at once
| proceeded to establish the most friendly
i relations with the prosepctive nominee.
i When Gage was nominated Basset fa po
litical future was assured. Comment ran
j along the line that he was to have an
other term as Harbor Commissioner, but
I the "organization" had others in view.
i The office of Shipping Commissioner was
; not lost sight of and so Basset) was ad
! vised to seek the good graces of Senator
i Perkins to obtain the favor in that quar
: ter which was once desired to reward
Kilburn. This is how it happened that
' Bassett became a candidate for United
| States Shipping Commissioner.
1 Bassett served with Burns on the State
1 Central Committee which conducted tile.
Markham campaign and as a reward for
hi.- services was appointed Harbor Com- i
i missioner. It cannot be called to mind
I that his service was of any benefit to the
State, but as he was recognized then for
discovering Markham perhaps he should
now be rewarded for not discovering j
Gage.
AMERICAN LEGION OF HONOR.
The Grand Council Holds Its Annual
Session and Elects Officers for
the Current Term.
At the session of the Grand Council of the
American Legion of Honor held in B'ne B'rlth
Hall the reports presented showed that the
financial condition of the order is. in a healthy
â â¢late. Needed legislation was adopted and re
ferred to the supreme head of the order tor
approval, at the session to be held in August
next. The following named were elected the
officers of the Grand Council for the current
term: William Metzner. commander; E. V.
Jones vice commander; W. W. Hobart, orator;
V; (* Sterling, secretary; W. H. H. Hamil
ton treasurer: E. B. Cooper, chaplain: Mary
C Snyder, guide; O. F. â  Haitian, warden; A.
A. Nathan, sentry: J. H. Baker, Gus I'ohl
man and J.- W. Disbrow, finance committee;
Thomas Fllbern, supreme representative; W.
H. H. Hamilton, alternate. The new officers
were installed by District Deputy Commander
Walter D. Mansfield.
Celebration Postponed.
Arrangements were made for a grand
! celebration at Larkspur to-morrow, but
i owing' to the stubbornness of wind and
I tide the event will have to be postponed
' one week, to May 14. There .was to have
i been a plank sidewalk laying "bee" in
| order that the many visitors of that pretty
; little resort in Marin County could travel
1 around the town and not get their fancy
! slippers and patent leathers soiled. Over
1 $300 worth of lumber, amounting to about
22,000 feet, had been ordered, and the inten
! tion was for the citizens to turn out with
; hammers and. saws and place the new
sidewalks in position. The lumber was to
have been there to-day, but the gentleman
I who navigates the scow schooner on
i which It was to. arrive failed to get the
material on the ground in time, and hence
I the postponement.
Stabbed a Sailor.
i Domlnico Rumaz, who stabbed John
! Johnson, a sailor in the doorway of a sa

i Thursday night, was instructed and ar
raigned before Acting Police Judge Groez

CORRIGAN CORRUPTED
HIS JOCKEY STANFORD
__# . If. T II __ Fh 1
Made Him Lose a Hurdle Race at
Latonia, Ky.
Rascally Doings of the Ingleside Czar Lead to a
Suit for Damages That Will Develop an
Interesting and Ugly History.
EDWARD CORRIGAN, czar of
Ingleslde and sultan of Emery
ville, will be haled into court
shortly to show cause why he
V should not be compelled to pay
$5000 to Alfred Nickells for defaming
Nickells* character to Prince Poniatow
ski and inducing the Prince to dis
charge Nickells as his trainer of racing
horses.
There was filed in the Superior Court
late yesterday afternoon a complaint
by Attorney Bert Schlesinger entitled
Alfred Nickells vs. Edward Corrigan.
The complaint recites that the plaintiff
was in the employ of Andre Poniatow
ski from November of last year until
April 10 of this year as a horse trainer.
EDW/rtRO CORRIGAN.
and that on the date last mentioned
Edward Corrigan said in the presence
of Prince Poniatowskl and others:
"Nickells is the crookedest man on
thj racetrack. (Jet rid of him. Not be
cause of what would happen now, but
what might happen if you keep him."
The complaint alleges that the Words
quoted were slanderous and defama
tory, and were the cause of his dismis
sal from employment by the Prince and
damaged Nickells to the extent- of $5000.
A second alleged cause of complaint is
that four days later Corrigan said in
the presence of bystanders: "Nickells
is the crookedest man on the race
track."
H. Cooper, owner of Silverado, a well- ,
known race horse, will be an important
witness for the plaintiff in the suit. Mr.
Cooper is a young gentleman of means,
who finds recreation in racing not from
mercenary motives, but for the pure
love of the sport; and because he dis
approved of Corrigan's gambling
methods he and his horses were ruled
off the track a short time ago. Cooper
is connected with the story of Corri
gan's animosity toward Nickells, which
dates from January 14 of this year. On
that day Cooper's horse Silverado ran
against Corrigan's horse Colonel Bart
lett. Just before the start Nickells said
to Corrigan, "1 think I can win this
race," Silverado having been entered in
Nickells' name. "7 "
Silverado beat the Corrigan horse,
and Corrigan, with the "gameness" of
a pawnbroker, "roared." Being a job
ber himself, he thought everybody else
must be the same, and he accused
Cooper of having jobbed him. The story
was told to a Call reporter yesterday
by Mr. Cooper.
"After a very close finish my horse
won," said Mr. Cooper. "Corrigan
raised quite a furor and declared that
if any other man but himself had been
second in the race he would have pro
tested against awarding the purse to
Cooper. He claimed that he had been
the victim of foul play and went be
fore the board of stewards and tried
to have us ruled off the track. I was
invited to appear before the board, but
I was not permitted to know the na
ture of the charges against me. I had
heard that Corrigan had said that I
had paid two of the jockeys in the race
to pull their horses in order that mine
might win. ..' -
"I stated my case to the board, and
said that I had been absent in Oregon
for ten days prior to the race and had
returned to this city only on the morn
ing of the race. I had a gentleman of
high standing to testify to this fact
and I insisted that he should be heard
in my behalf. Corrigan said, 'Nobody
disputes your word,' and the rest of the
board of stewards seemed to have
nothing to say. Corrigan, as usual,
was running the whole thing. Corrigan
refused to allow my witness to be
called. Then he offered Jockey Stan
ford a race horse if he would go before
the board of stewards and testify
against us.
"Shortly after that Nickells wanted
to enter another colt of mine and he
went to Secretary .Green and asked
permission to enter the colt for a race.
Green admitted that we had been ex
onerated by the board of stewards, and
said that he would allow the colt to
run if I would agree to certain black
mailing demands of Corrigan, which I
refused to do, and my colt was not al
lowed to run. The demand that Cor
rigan made upon me I decline to state
. â ;â --.'.â â¢ â -â - â  -.- â ..â 
at this time, but it will all come out at
the trial." â â â¢'â >-' *'_
The Jockey Stanford alluded to by Mr.
Cooper in the foregoing statement is A. E.
â¢Stanford, a hurdle rider cf fifteen years
experience. He also will be a witness to
the devious ways of Corrigan. Stanford
said that in June. 1897, he was engaged by
Corrigan to ride Corrigan's horse Redding
ton in a hurdle race in Latonia, Ky. Im
mediately prior to the race Corrigan met
Stanford with the following- proposition,
as related in an affidavit:
"Corrigan said to me: 'You cannot win
on this horse to-day. I have got a bet
on War Bonnet, and they tell me he is a
good horse to-day. Now don't you hit
this horse you are riding with the whip.
I don't care if you get beat as far as
that fence (indicating a fence about 100
yards distant). If the judges ask you any
questions,' continued Corrigan. 'tell them
what I told you and they won't say any
thing to you. There's a race coming off
next Tuesday for non-winners, and I will
run this horse Reddington in there and he
will win. In order to get into that race I
must be beat to-day.'
"I rode Reddington," continued Jockey
Stanford, "and he was last in the race.
The first price in the betting was 7 to 10.
War Bonnet, the horse on which Corrigan
had placed his money was selling at 3 or
4 to 1. â¢ On the following Tuesday Redding
ton was entered in the hurdle race for
non-winners and his price in the betting
was 2 to 1, and he won easily. There were
about six horses in the race. That was
the only time that anybody has ever ap
proached me during my fifteen years' ex
perience in riding races."
The next incident narrated ny Stanford
throws a flood of light upon the charac
ter of the racetrack Czar. It follows:
"On April IS this year I called on Mr.
Corrigan by appointment at the Palace
Hotel, and the following conversation en
sued. As I entered his room he said,
'How do- you do? I sent for you last
night, and I am very sorry I failed to
meet you.' I told him I was there and
had waited until 10 o'clock. He then said.
'I have just received a telegram offering
me $5000 for Bachelor, and I don't think
I will take it. I tjiink he can win the
grand national steeplechase at New
York.' I said that I didn't think Bach
elor was worth $5000, and he said, 'I can
buy some pretty good horses at times,
and I can give $5000 any day to get a
horse that I can make a jumper of. I
give my horses to whom I please, and I
will give you a good jumper if you will
testify against Cooper and Nickells.' f
"I said, 'I am willing to testify to what
I know before the board of stewards,' and
he said that the board would meet

LOS ANGELES CITY
LOST THE BIG SUIT
WATER COMPANY^ VICTORY IN
THx SUPREME COURT.
Its Great- Plant May Be Purchased
but Not Seized â Contract, Not
a Lease, Was Made.
The big legal fight between the city of
Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Water
Company was decided by the Supreme
Court yesterday in favor of the water
company. In 1868. when the city was not
larger than a village it owned its own
water works, which seems to have con
sisted at that time of a crude wheel and
about ten miles of wooden Hume. In that
year the city entered into a contract with
the water company by which it agreed to
turn over the "plant" mentioned to the
company upon the consideration that the
company would put in and maintain a
modern plant, extend pipe lines into the
city as demand required and furnish
schools and municipal buildings, fire hy
drants, etc., with water without expense
to the city. Another condition in the
agreement was that at the end of thirty
years the city could acquire possession of
the water works upon the payment to the
company of the value of the plant, mams
and all improvements. ;â¢â¢
The thirty years expired last year, and
the municipality sought to secure posses
sion of the water works, but did not pro
pose to pay for the same. It was main
tained that the franchise was equivalent
to the improvements, that the agreement
was a lease and that upon the expiration
of the same the property in question went
back to the city the same as the leased
piece of land with any improvements that
the tenant might have placed hereon.* A
move was taken to take the water works
by force and have a receiver appointed to
attend to the running of the business un
til the matter was settled. The water
company secured an injuncion to prevent
this being done and the lower court decid
ed against the city. It was from this in
junction that the . anpeal to the higher
court was taken. Before a final decision
was given half a dozen other actions at
law were started and appeals taken, but
the principal one was a suit by the city
to recover the water works.
The Supreme Court declares that the
agreement was a contract and not a lease.
Therefore it' has no right to that which
it never owned, the origâ "plant" being
all that was ever transferred from the
city to the company. Another point was
that the water company could not be
compelled to deliver over the plant, etc..
until the value is paid by the city. If tho
city wants to own these water works it
must pay for the same, according to the
contract. The other cases relating to- the
same matter before the court were dis
posed of according to the principal de
cision.
Was Not a Vagrant.
Mrs. Josephine Shanley. 658 Folsom
street, who has only been married three
weeks, went out of her house at 2 o'clock
yesterday morning to buy a ham sand
wich, so she told Judge Graham yester
day, and Policemen Driscoll and Greall
arrested her and booked her on a charge
of vagrancy. Her husband is a mechanic
and appeared in court to ask for a dismis
sal of the case. The Judge unuer the cir
cumstances dismissed it. but advised Mrs.
Shanley not to go for a ham sandwich at
such an unreasonable hour. He also ad
vised the officers to be more careful.
A Basket Picnic.
The regular monthly meeting of the Cal
ifornia State Floral Society will be held
to-day in the garden of John Hinkel of

Wiester will read a paper on the subject
of "Roses." Nearly all of the members of
the society will be in attendance, because
of a novel feature that is to be introduced.
They will take their lunches and form
really a basket picnic. The majority from
this "city will leave on the 9:30 a. m. boat.

THE ATKINSON INCIDENT.
IT is well that the discussion of national policy, j
novel or otherwise, shall be on the lines of reason j
and conducted with calmness. Edward Atkinson j
is one of the most distinguished of American pub
licists, and. with the single exception of the late )
David A. Wells, has been the most copious writer in i
this country upon economic and public subjects. He
has chosen to write and print statistics bearing upon j
the commerce, climate and characteristics of the tor
rid zone, and to draw therefrom conclusions as to the
wisdom of. large expenditures of life and treasure in
the conquest and occupancy of tropical territory.
These publications he addressed to Admiral Dewey,
Generals Otis, Lawton and Mac Arthur and to the
members of the Philippine Commission now in
Manila. The civil officers of the Government have
been ordered to exclude them from the mails, and it
No one is prepared to defend the wisdom of Mr.
Atkinson in sending his pamphlets to our highest j
naval, military and civil officers in the Philippines. i
They are all busy. It is a languid climate, and in their |
moments of repose we have no doubt those grizzled i
sons of Mars are more interested in a cool drink or
the study of how to shuck" some additional gar- i
ment made necessary in the temperate zone but not I
conventionally nor physically required under a ver
tical sun.
Perhaps it would have been better to let Mr. At
kinson's pamphlets go and test the fidelity of those
martial and civil officials by writing them that the
same are on the index expurgatorius of the Govern
ment and must not be read. To take the matter out
of the mails, may em like a suspicion of immaturity
on the part of those uniformed gentlemen, and the
fear that they may be led astray by tables demonstrat- I
ing the loss of revenue to the United States by abate- j
ment of the tariff on sugar. Mr. Atkinson has ad- |
dressed himself to a quite impassioned table of figures i
on that and other subjects of equally vivid interest, j
The administration should not permit itself to be mis- j
understood in this matter. That there is danger of \
misunderstanding cannot be denied.
Divers views are held as to the Philippine policy. |
Official tolerance and hospitality to the expression of j
them all would seem to be the proper American j
policy, consistent with the still prevalent ideas of what j
American liberty means. In the period of our Revo- j
Jution Burke. Fox and Pitt in the beginning of that]
struggle took sides with our forefathers in revolt

The speeches of those

Ired and twenty-five years ago.
For a century and a quarter it has been supposed '

that freedom and tolerance. Lei not the act of the

Let nothing be done that will justify the fear that
in escaping from British rule we escaped from* more
than we have established for ourselves.
It will be seen clearly, and should be seen and un
derstood at once, that every show of arbitrary power
or sign of fear that a policy will not bear criticism
and therefore comment must be suppressed gives
strength to the fear that designs of imperialism and
militarism are cherished, and that when they come it
will be not only to rough ride the rights of subjects
in the tropics, but to abridge the liberty of citizens at
home.
Testimony showing the injurious effects of fumes
emanating from the garbage crematory ought not to
be surprising, as The Call long ago exposed the fact
that it is the habit of the Examiner managers to have
large numbers of copies of that paper burned at the
crematory while they are still fresh enough to retain
all their odors.
The demand of Spain for the cession of Chinese
territory is embarrassing, for if we should ever be
called upon to whip her again we would have to take
that possession from her and become Chinese spolia
tors ourselves.
General Merritt's statement that Alger is the best
Secretary of War .the world has ever seen is apt to
raise the suspicion that there is about as much AJgcr
iÂ«m in Merritt as there is merit in Alger.

A RECREANT GOVERNOR. -\
THE Examiner and its Canadian annex always
have the latest news of thÂ« imperial progress of
C. P. Huntington throughout the State., As he
sits in his carriage, with the despotic expression of an
oriental potentate, throwing contemptuous glances on
cither side, he can always feel confident that the latest
dispensations of his providence have been duly
promulgated.
Among other press deliveries for which the public
should be duly thankful is the information that the
requisition of Governor Gage by Mr. Huntington has
â¢een thoroughly established. It is always advanta
geous to know the exact truth, and, while it is not a
:ause for gratification but for regret, The Call ac
:epts due service of the confirmation of the belief
t has for some months entertained, that, within a
xasonable time, the present executive would throw
â side the mask of respect for his constituents and
eveal the hardened features of a tool of monopoly.
Mr. Gage accepted the nomination of a Republican
State Convention and passed through the entire
canvass that preceded his election on , the distinct
pledge that the railroad was out of politics and with
the general belief that he possessed such mental in
dependence, such a strong character and such pa
triotic devotion to American institutions, that not
even a doubt need be entertained that his adminis
tration of the high office to which he aspired would be
an honor to his party and to the State.
He had scarcely been inaugurated when his. per
sonal announcement that he favored the candidacy of
Dan Burns excited suspicion in the minds of the peo
ple, and especially among faithful advocates of Re
publican principles, who had supported him with
earnestness and with sincerity. So long, however, as
he did not use the patronage at his disposal to con
trol the political situation, he was not only exempted
from severe. criticism for his individual disregard of a
popular sentiment that was practically unanimous, but
he was commended for his passive recognition of the
right of a separate branch of the State government.
hen Dan Burns was defeated, however, and the
Legislature had adjourned, the suspicions previously
entertained ripened into certainties. Mr. Gage now
presents himself as a Republican Governor, prepared
to exert all the power of his office to aid the railroad
design to throw California out of the Republican
column in the Presidential election of 1900. No
sooner had Matt Quay received the formal but void
appointment to succeed himself as a Federal Senator
from the Governor of Pennsylvania than Mr. Gage
declared his intention to appoint Dan Burns, if our
highest national council reversed its own precedents
and violated the fundamental law from which its ex
istence was derived. As might have been expected,
the Examiner, professedly a Democratic organ, hav
ing insidiously helped the railroad during the entire
Senatorial deadlock at Sacramento, was favored with
the first opportunity to print this declaration of in
tention, which has been followed by repeated evi
dences of a set purpose to deliver the State to Mr.
Huntington.
The Call loyally and effectively aided Mr. Gage in
his campaign, not for a moment supposing that the
treacheries which are now being demonstrated were
possible or even conceivable. Its first duty is to its
country â its second to the Republican party. The
true and permanent interests of both are identical.
! The welfare of neither can be promoted by corrup
'. tion, by fraud, by masquerading, by a combination of
outrageous assaults upon popular government, visible
as the noonday sun and conceived in iniquity and
j brought forth in dishonor. Therefore, because The
I Call meant exactly what it said in 1898. because the
1 utter insincerity of Mr. Gage has now be
come apparent, because the executive depart
i ment of the State government has been deeply
cauterized by the railroad brand, because there
is a manifest determination that the lower elements
of politics shall control the organization of that
great party which received its baptism of glory when
it was consecrated to "Liberty and Union, one and
inseparable." we warn the Republicans of the State
i against the disrupting machinations of the corruption
! ists of all parties, and urge them, in their primaries
j and by every form of personal and collective in
; fluence, to prove that power of resistance which the
I Republican majority in the Legislature successfully
i asserted, and, in their primary capacity, to enforce
j their right of absolute control.
The battle now being waged throughout the Union
i by great Republicans, backed by their incorruptible
fellow citizens, to suppress fraud and treachery within
1 their own party and to unite national patriotism for
the ascendancy of American self-government in equal
antagonism to monopolistic dogmatism and obstinacy
on the one side and to every form of proletarianism
on the other is one of the noblest spectacles of the
century. The contest of 1000 cannot be .yon by
chicanery, by vacillation, by infidelity to principle or
by the denial of the profoundest truth ever expressed
in a Roman maxim â that "the safety of the republic
i: the supreme law."
NATIONAL SUPERVISION NEEDED.
EVIDENCE collected by the Illinois legislative
investigation of impure foods offered for sale in
the .markets of that State confirms the impres
sion that the evil is of proportions too large to be
dealt with by the .States separately, that its suppres
sion requires the exercise of the powers of the Na
tional Government itself.
One of the witnesses before the legislative com-
I mittee, a Chicago druggist, testified that while most
! European countries forbid the sale of adulterated
goods within their own borders they do not forbid
the manufacture of such articles for sale elsewhere.
As a consequence the United States has been made
the dumping ground for all kinds of vile mixtures
compounded in France or in Germany and sent here
ito be sold. It is clear offenses of that kind could be
much more effectively checked by the officials of the
nation at the custom-houses of ports of entry than by
i State authorities. When adulterated goods have once
! â¢ I tamed entrance to the country and found their way
to the hands of the retailers it is a very difficult task
i indeed to seek them out and prevent their sale.
Further evidence given to the committee discloses
the fact that adulterations are largely used to preserve
foods for long periods of time, or to color them so
as to make them more attractive to consumers. By
such adulterations articles of food that in themselves
are wholesome are made dangerous to health. It is
stated that the chemical most used as a preservative
is salicylic acid, a drug which has an extremely per
nicious effect upon the human system.
A- considerable number of States have now adopted
pure 'food laws of a more or less comprehensive char
acter, but even where they are enforced it is found
the results are not altogether satisfactory. In this
State, for example, it was noted that the vigorous
crusade against impure food in San Francisco- had the
effect of causing the dealers in such articles to ship
them to cities and towns where less vigilance was ex
ercised. Thus the good effects of the law were purely
local and were obtained largely at' the expense of
other communities.
The same defect interferes with -the operation of all
THE SA7N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 6, 1899.
local or State laws on the subject. A stringent law
in California preventing the manufacture of impure
goods in the State would simply open a way for
adulterated goods manufactured elsewhere. A State
has no effective means of shutting Qut the products
of another State, and consequently its food laws, no
matter how well devised or with what vigor enforced,
are inadequate to the issue.
For some years past there has been an attempt at
every session of Congress to procure the enactment
of a national pure food law.' The dairymen of New
i ork have fought against the sale of adulterated
cheese fraudulently marked with the New York
brand, the flour men of Minnesota have endeavored
to obtain legislation preventing the adulteration of
flour, and several other States have, through their
delegations in Congress, been equally earnest in the
effort to bring about the enactment of. remedial legis
lation, but hitherto all efforts have been in vain.
The time has come for making a combined effort
to put an end to the evil. Adulterated food, drink and
medicine constitute far more serious menaces to pub
lic welfare than the trusts about which so much is
being said. If a vigorous campaign of education on
the subject were undertaken now it is probable the
desired legislation could be obtained at the next ses
sion of Congress, and to that end boards of trade,
chambers of commerce and all associations of manu
facturers of pure foods should unite.
DELUSIONS OF FOREIGNERS.
THERE are many foreigners who actually believe
that the maintenance of the American republic
is impossible, that it will be a very short time be
fore our government is changed to the imperial form,
I and that, if necessary, the army will be used for that
purpose. Only yesterday an intelligent Englishman,
with whom the wish was probably father to the
thought, expressed his belief that we were on the
verge of a revolution, and that Great Britain and the
United States together would soon appropriate all
vacant spaces in the world 'and enter upon a crusade
in Asia and in Africa, and ultimately in Europe, com
| pletely to enforce the rule of the Anglo-Saxon.
Among the number of straws" that to his mind con-
I clusively proved an uncontrollable drift in this direc
tion, he mentioned the fact that it had been published
'that Secretary Alger had determined that General
Miles, who has always retained his belief in our na
tional institutions, should be deprived of his command
and that General Merritt, who publicly declared that
the "constitution had been outgrown," would take his
! place.
The superficial indications of American politics are
very deceptive to those who do not comprehend the
American people. The loose talk, so common of late
among mere popularity seekers, the determination of
an unpatriotic class of opulent speculators to drag
the country, nolens volens, into a policy of foreign
acquisition, the frequency of matrimonial alliances
with aristocratic families, the disregard of popular
rights by many of our politicians and by some of our
statesmen, the corrupt use of money in Senatorial
elections and also in nominating conventions and
even at the polls, the frequent allusions to Columbia
as if she had been brought up. in a short republican
frock of common stuff and was now old enough to
wear imperial satin with a long train these and other
similar factPhave been misinterpreted as if they were
the real and the predominating signs of the times in
this republic.
The deep sea currents are often contrary to the
movements on the surface. In the United States
there are resistless forces in the hearts and in the
minds of the people, intelligently conscious of their
sovereignty, that are not declamatory or boisterous,
and for months or years are concealed by the as
sumptions and the pretensions of' self-constituted
leaders who when the necessity is developed and the
hour is ripe disappear like stubble before a tornado.
In 1806 a stranger in our land who read the volumes
of frothy matter, with buncombe illustrations, pub
lished in the Journal- Examiner or the Examiner-
Journal and in other newspapers affected with
epilepsy or St. Vitus dance, or who listened to the
lurid rhetoric of W. J. Bryan and his corps of dema
gogues, might have really believed that the industrial
masses favored cheap money, the reduction of wages
and the economical degradation of their country. But
when the^ American brain and the American con
science inscribed their verdict upon the ballots there
was hardly enough Bryan Democracy left to supply
yeast for the next campaign.
If our English friend had enjoyed a longer expe- i
rience in the United States he might ,have awaited
some confirmation of the alleged determination of
Secretary Alger. He might at least have observed :
the very next day that the President did not sympa- ''
thize with the attempted excoriation of General Miles
by the Court of Inquiry. If he had examined the state i
papers of the President and his Cabinet, the military j
and naval reports, and all official documents bearing
en the war with Spain and its results, it would have
puzzled him to discover any avowal of imperialistic '
tendencies or any concealed affection for imperialism. |
If he had observed" the proceedings' of a very large
meeting recently held in Chicago, and of other meet- ;
ings held in New York, in Boston and in many
American cities, he would have ascertained the exist
ence of decided opposition to the expansion of our
territory away from this continent. Finally, if he had '
read, marked, learned and inwardly digested the i
columns of The Call for the last two years he would j
have found that the individuality of this republic and I
its freedom from all entangling alliances are still the
cherished convictions of many of our best and wisest
citizens.
The Mazct committee may think it has weakened I
Croker's boss-ship in New York, but the fact that the
papers of the city devoted as much space to an ac- j
count of his departure for England as was given to
a description of the President's visit to Philadelphia
to unveil the Grant monument inclines to the belief
the boss will come back to his own when the Mazet j
men have gone to join the Lexow fellows who once j
flourished as brightly and just about as long as a i
skyrocket. . \

, Reduction Works.
Moore evidence was piled up yesterday
in the case of the Sanitary Reduction
Works of San Francisco* and others
against the California Reduction Company
, and others to prove that the monopoly
was scattering the germs of disgust and
disease and other germs in the thickly
settled neighborhood to the northward of
! the crematory.
One. witness told of a fall of ashes and
partly burned paper and rags that fell
In his neighborhood about five weeks ago
1 when the wind was blowing from the
southeast. It resembled a fall of snow, he
I said, only that it was not so clean or in
vigorating, although the odor was strong
enough to move a brick house.
Mrs. Mary Wohlken of , ; ,28 Ninth street
: told about the intolerable Stench arising
j from the chimney of the crematory. One
of her daughters, between 11 and 12 years
j old, was sick for a long time and an older
, daughter. was 111 all summer. The doc
tor whom she had called in told her that
the stench and the foul gases from the
j crematory smokestack were the causes of
j the sickness of her children. One of the
girls was ill all the time. When the wind
,was blowing from the south the witness
could not go out of the door or leave a
; door or window open because of the
! stench, which she described as suffocat
ing.
"It sticks in the throat," she added,
"and you can't breathe."
Frank Kosmalski, a property-owner re
siding at 4 Medea court, between Eighth
! and Ninth, Harrison and Byrant streets,
corroborated the testimony of Mrs. Wohl
j ken as to the asphyxiating, character of
t.he smoke from the cremators* smoke
stack. He said also that real estate had
depreciated in value very much by rea
son of the nuisance of burning garbage
in the neighborhood. This nuisance was
more apparent when the wind was south
l east than when the wind blew from the
j opposite quarter. He told about a snow
; storm of ashes and bits of charred- pa-
I per about the size of 50-cent pieces.
which appeared to be bits of the Ban
Francisco Examiner. This storm lasted
two days and a half last week and was
accompanied by an odor compared to
; which Limburger cheese was a bouquet of
violets.
Joseph Andres was another property
; owner who complained of the nuisance
! His property was at the corner of Eighth
I and Minna streets, more than half a mile
away, and when the wind was right to
use his own language, "I got all the stuff
i I want." This witness was a picturesque
i character with a rugged How of language
"It's the meatiest smell that ever
I smote," he said. "1 can't describe If
I there's no name for It. It stinks the house
: through from cellar to garret and even
paralyzes the back yard. Wherever It
; happens to strike a person it will knock
him down. It's the biggest smell in the
i city of San Francisco. On one occasion
: I smelled It clear up to my own residence
I corner of Laguna street and Rose aye
! nue." ."'Â»_'â ...

TESTING THE
LAW OF WEIGHTS
AND MEASURES
Attorney General Ford
Files a Brief. â

AN INTERESTING QUESTION
â â â 
V
FAMOUS -'CINCH" LAW BEFORE
THE COURTS.
â â
Judge Hughes Called Upon to Pass
on the Constitutionality of an
Act of the Legis
lature.
Attorney General Ford filed yesterday j
'in the Superior Court of Sacramento
County an Interesting document in the j
suit brought by J. P. Neely of San Diego
against Secretary of State Charles F.
Curry, entitled "Points and authorities of
defendant in support of his demurrer."
The filing of the document recalls an act
passed by the Legislature of .1891, which
authorized the Boards of Supervisors to â¢
appoint an. officer in each county to in
' spect weights and measures and to charge i
' merchants for the inspection made, and
which, when brought to the attention of
the business men. by The Call in March.
i 189S, was roundly denounced by them as
being a "cinch" law and by other uncom-
p limentary names.
The statement of facts as set forth in
the defendant's brief show that on April
â 24, 1899, J. F. Neely presented to Judge
Joseph W. Hughes of the Superior Court
an" affidavit and petition praying for a
! peremptory writ of mandate commanding
Secretary of State Curry, as ex officio I
State sealer of weights and measures to
examine, certify and seal for the plaintiff j
J. F. Neely, as County Sealer of the coun- |
i ty of San Diego, all balances, weights and
j measures to be used by him as standards
; pursuant to the provision of the statute
! On the Secretary of State's refusal to do '
so Neely tiled the petition and affidavit I
: settingforththefacts mentioned. and Judge '
Hughes cited Mr. Curry to appear before
him ana show cause why the peremptory
writ of mandate should not issue as i
prayed for. j
The Secretary of State filed a demurrer '
to the proceedings, and upon this de- !
murrer the brief was filed. The brief was
prepared by Deputy Attorney General ;
rel?e r Fnn A -.n St ,r l V ant - Among the points
fnl- Th" ln Â«h*'. demurrer an * the follow
ing, me act is in violation of the Federal
constitution; it does not describe the sub
ject of the act; the plaintiff's petition does
_ ot . & ate i hat he has Produced his
weights and measures before the defend
ant at !, he time he demanded that they
be seal.,!; the petition does not state that
he tendered to the State Sealer's deputy -
the fee of $100. and there are a number of
other technical points. .
The brief takes up each point separately
and discusses them minutely, and quoting
a number of authorities in support ot
them.
, The decision of Judge Hughes will be
looked forward to with deep Interest by
the merchants of this St.it. . Fortunately
for the merchants of this city, there is
not such an official' here. If one. were ap- j
pointed and he were allowed to collect his ;
! fees under the act his salary would equal
that of the President of the United States.

JÂ»on Chong. Door Sergeant of the Sal
vation Army, Is Arrested on a
Charge of Malicious
Mischief.
. There is a religious war on in China
town that has made Â«he highbinders wrap
themselves in a cloak of seeming virtue
and point the linger of outraged .decency
at th*.* Christianised Chinese.
Pong Chong, door sergeant of the Salva
tion Army, was arrested yesterday on
nearly a year ago. .
It has been a right for supremacy be
4wepn the two factions that labor In the
cause -.f the Lord and, according to the
Salvationists, the "regulars" have traded
.upon their name to win shekels and gain
recruits. In August last gleberg, who
figured so notoriously in the Dugan case
and brought God's Army into disrepute,
was out with th" regulars' book appealing
to the charitably inclined Chinese, when
Pon Chong. disguised in citizen's clothes,
asked for the hook. lngl< berg, thinking
h>> had run up against a Chinese admirer,
handed over the coveted prize, which Pon
immediate!*.* confiscated upon the ground
that th" notice read that the contribu
tions were for the Salvation Army. Not
cnlv did the books of the regulars appeal
to the Mongolians in the name of the
Salvationists, hut the signs over the reg
ulars' headquarters at 20 Waverly place
had the Chinese characters which the
Salvationists claim as the signs of their
order. These characters the Salvation
Army have compelled the memo* of
God's Regular Army to blot lit, and
upon these facts Lee Shue bases his com
plaints against Pon Chong.
A side issue in the war which will prob
ably be made much of in the case .if the
fighting armies is the fact that the reg
ulars had posted over Chinatown pome
2>'Â«X> placards announcing that the Salva
tion Army was offering a prize of $300 for
Lee Shue's head. In retaliation the Sal
vation Army distributed pink hills
Throughout the Chinese quarter denying
the charges and explaining how the reg
ulars were trading upon the Salvation
Army's credentials. Captain Graham and
Lieutenant Banks are the two lassies In
charge of the Chinese corps, with head
quarters on Sacramento street.
Pon Chong. whose arrest is really but a
pretext to bring the matter of the fight
ing armies to the attention of the law.
Is an Intelligent Chinaman, who has been
connected with the Salvation Army for
the past three years. Pon is not afraid 10
meet the charge lodged against him.
"I love the Lord," said Pon. "and he
will be with me. The people of God's
Regular Army have been a hindrance to
our cause. I am sorry for them."
Pon's case will me up this morning
before acting Police Judge Groezlnger.
Lee Shue and God's Regular Army will be
re presented by Attorneys 1-ringk- & Prin-

urtleW of local and State Interest. Wil
lard Batchelder has a discussion about
charity music pupils, and Alfred Metzger
talks about musical prodigies. The
usual Saunterer paragraphs about what

the title to the office of State Harbor
Commissioner." now held by Herold.
The Warring Christian Armies.
The complaint sets forth the oft told |
story of how. on March 13, 1894, Governor*!
H. H. Markham Issued to the relator, F.
S. Chadbourne, a commission as a mem- |
ber of the Board of State Harbor Com- j
missioners to succeed W. H. Brown, and j
the fact that Chadbourne Immediately J
( took his seat; how Governor Budd, on
March 15, 1897, appointed Herold to sue- [
ceed Chadbourne at the expiration of ;
' the . latter's term In March of 1898, and l
how Chadbourne stepped out and Herold
in. The complaint, however, sets forth
that Herold did not properly qualify and
the Senate In Its regular session this year |
! did not act, as required by law, upon the
name of Herold as a 'member of the
board. Then, on April 17, 1890, Governor
'â  Gage issued Chadbourne a commission for
the place occupied by Her old, but It was
repudiated by the board.
Chadbourne therefore asks that the
court determine that he Is entitled to the
office and that Herold is an Intruder,
I holding the office solely by virtue of an
; Illegal usurpation.

next week, one of the Important features
In the make-up of Ralph Delmore. who
plays the part of the fiery Frenchman,
Paty dv Clam, is a goatee of remarkable
proportions. ; During one scene he noticed
that nothing he did received Its usual
award of laughter, and It was not until
the three men who play the final scene
with him had to hand him their visiting
cards that he discovered the cause. All
three wrote "Where Is your goatee?"
Fortunately for him he had nothing more
to do than get off the stage as best he
could. Once he knew his goatee was not
there he was helpless.
GAVE Hliyi A WATCH.
First Sergeant Matthews Receives a
Parting Gift From His Men.
First Sergeant Ralph AW Matthews,
Troop M, Fourth United States Cavalry,
was presented with a very . handsome
gold watch on Thursday afternoon by the
men of the troop. The present was a
great surprise to Sergeant Matthews, who
had no intimation that he was to be
made the recipient of such a gift. The
presentation was made by Captain Lock
wood, who commands the troop. In a
short speech he told Sergeant Matthews
that the watch was a gift from the men,
who desired to show their appreciation
of his soldierly qualities, and that they
had chosen this way of doing it. The ser
geant responded with a few words of
thanks. Sergeant Matthews' second term
of enlistment ended yesterday and he was
honorably discharged from the service.
He does not intend to re-enlist, but will
remain In San Francisco. He had made
for himself an excellent reputation as an
obedient and capable soldier. ' The pre
sentation was made at the evening roll
call of the troop.
WILL CLOSE TO-NIGHT
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY
C. L. A. S. BAZAAR SCORES A BIG
SUCCESS.
Crowds Throng Native Sons' Hall to
Aid a Worthy Cause Exciting
Race for Popular Votes.
There seems to be no diminution in the
crowds that attend the bazaar of the
Catholic Ladies' Aid Society. Native
Sons' Hall was comfortably filled last
night with the friends of the charitable
organization and money was liberally
spent to swell th* fund being raised by
the society to carry on its good work.
Every booth was occupied by its repre
sentatives and every representative did
her utmost to have the visitor buy or par
take of the wares. Pretty girl's moved
through the crowd .with tickets for raffle
or entertainment, and it was hard to re
fuse their appeals.
The contest for the handsome clock
grows more exciting as the bazaar draws
nearer to a close. The friends of the
leading candidates have taken a decided
interest in their choice and are enlisting
the services and purses of their friends
with a view to having their favorite win.
chief D. T. Sullivan of the Fire Depart
ment has a lead of 403 votes, but It Is
thought this will be narrowed down to
night, as many are saving their votes for
a final effort. Sergeant Michael Joseph
Conboj is a close second, with 338 votes,
and it Is likely to Improve at the last mo
ment. Sergeant P. Shea has 178 to his i
credit, and Assistant Chief Shaughnessy
comes next with 153. Sergeant Johnny B.
Martin has *4. > votes, and his friends are
digging around for more. Assistant Chief
P. H. Dolan has 98, but will surely round
the century mark to-night.
The Cathedral Booth, No, 8, is doing a
booming business. Miss Emma J. Feasel,
the gypsy fortune teller. Is a prominent
feature of the booth, and when not de
ciphering lines on the palm or thumbing
a pack of cards she is winning shekel?
around the floor by disposing of tickets
for the raffle of the "Filipino kid."
Th- dancing school which is attached
to the St. Charles Booth No. 2 is coining
money for the society. Kelleher and
O'Connell, who are exhibiting their clev
erness as clog and Irish jig dancers, are
becoming general favorites and the booth
is nightly crowded with Interested spec
tators.
Miss Burke sang the "Holy City" last
evening, and responded to a demand for
an encore.
To-night the fan* will close and there is
every promise of a big attendance. The
beautiful bric-a-brac, the useful articles
and the hundred and one pretty things on
exhibition will be auctioned. No musical
programme will be given, as there will
be little time for an entertainment. The
keepers of the booths ,re getting ready
for the rush. All are tuning their voices,
trimming up their prettiest exhibits and
preparing generally, as they desire to see
the chanty bazaar close In a blaze if
glory. There Is every indication of It do
ing so, as those who have been there
nightly since its opening* have lost none
of their enthusiasm. It Is expected the
raffles will be drawn and the articles of
fered will be disposed of. So the Invita
tion is out, come early, avoid the crush
and choose what you want and aid a
worthy cause.
Imported Game Birds.
The beautiful English ring-necked
pheasant that has attracted so much ad
miration in the East is soon to become an
inhabitant of this State. Thursday the
State Fish and Game Commln*s'o i re
ceived from New Jersey three crate;; con
taining sixty of these game birds, which
will be liberated in Mendocino and Fres
no counties. This Importation wa.i under
an agreement made with the sportsro.
associations of these counties, who are to
stand half of the expense and attend to
the protection of the birds. As th? pheas
ants are all In good condition It Is be
lieved that they will thrive and soon be
come one of the best game bird-* of the
State. They are under the projection of
the law, which prohibits their being
killed, under a heavy penalty.

WHAT MAKES
A PERCENTAGE
POKED GAME?
Question Submitted
to a Jury.
â â¦ â
DECIDE IT IN TEN MINUTES
TAKING "RAKE OFF FOR CIGARS
OR DRINKS NOT INCLUDED.
*
The Case of C. W. Redman of the
Palace Saloon, Market Street,
Tried and Defendant
Acquitted.
A jury has decided that the police were
wrong in arresting Charles W. Redman,
proprietor of the Palace saloon, 867 Mar
ket street, for conducting a percentage
game of poker in his saloon on the night
of April 24, when the police raided the re
sorts on Market street.
Redman's was the first case of the lot
to be tried. Judge Graham having lost no
; time in arranging for disposing of it. It
was called Thursday afternoon, but when
the court adjourned only two jurors had
been accepted, yesterday afternoon it
â¢ did not take long to select the other
I ten. The names of the twelve jurors are:
John Utschlg, Charles Frederick, 1..
Gassne*f, S. Schein, J. W. Riley, C. Forbes
J. Swan, Frank ii. La Falle, A. Hirsch
man, A. H. I. rod. Richard Finking and
J. L. Hoffman.
The first witness called was Policeman
i Jerome 11. Tyrrell, who testified to seeing
six men playing poker* in Redman's sa-
I loon and seeing a watcher take â _. chip
from the center of the table after each
hand and put It In his pocket and then
take it to the manager. He said he was
familiar with a percentage game and the
game he saw was one. He identified a
card taken from the wall which read:
; "Checks, 50 cents a stack." another card
containing the rules of the game, and
chips taken from the players, among
; whom was Henry Hoffman, the man who
was sentenced to six months last Tues
day for begging.
in cross-examination Tyrrell admitted
that before he joined the police force he
had played poker with friends and since
joining the force only on one or two oc
casions. Attorney Aoh, for the defend
\ ant, wanted to bring out how much he
knew about a percentage game. The ex
amination of the witness was noteworthy
. from the. fact that Ach objected to every
Question put to him by Prosecuting At
torney Wentworth except the questions
as to his name and occupation, Ach was
I willing to admit thai the evidence of Po
licemen Meyers, Eastman and J. L. Mur
phy would lie the same, and so the pros
â¢ ecution rested.
The defendant, Redman, took the stand
j and admitted that poker games were
played in his saloon. There was a "rake
off" not exceeding two chips, representing
5 cents, from each game, which was util
ized in providing the players with drinks.
: cigars or sandwiches. 1.. M. Ettinger, a
stock and grain broker, corroborated Red
man as to the fact that drinks or cigars
were furnished the players while playing
poker in the saloon.
Attorney Ach in his argument referred
to the fact that poker was not a bank
ing game, as decided by the Supreme
Court, and lie argued that nothing had
been shown that a percentage game had
been played at the Palace saloon.
The jury was out about ten minutes
and returned a verdict of acquittal. Ach
then moved to dismiss the case, of the
other defendants, and the Judge said ho
would reserve ids decision until this
morning. _______________________
NO SETTLEMENT YET.
Schoolteachers and Merchants Still in
Doubt as to Their Unpaid
Demands.
Another, effort was made yesterday to
settle the differences of the schoolteach
ers and the merchants as to who shall
have the $35,000 available for the payment
of the November and December claims
of both parties. The merchants and
teachers have agreed that the latter shall
withdraw their claims in order that the
money may ho applied to the claims of
the merchants, which amount to more
: than $80,000.
Yesterday the merchants held a con
ference with Auditor Wells and proposed
that they withdraw all of their demands
and then present a sufficient number to
cover the amount of money available.
This proposition was not acceded to. the
Auditor taking the stand that lie would
not make any disposition of tin- funds
; until some order of court had been made
â¢ authoriizng him to pay out the money
and at the same time giving him power
: to adjust the unpaid demands of the
teachers. It is held by the legal advisers
of all parties that another suit will have
to be instituted fore such an order can
i be made.

â¢"THE pleasant method and beneficial effects of the well-known remedy, Syrup of Figs, manufactured
-*â¢ by the California Fig Syrup- Company, illustrate the value of obtaining the liquid laxative principles
of plants known -to be medicinally laxative and presenting them in the form most refreshing to the taste
and acceptable to the system. It is the one perfect strengthening laxative,
CLEANSING THE SYSTEM EFFECTUALLY, DISPELLING
COLDS AND HEADACHES, PREVENTING FEVERS,
OVERCOMING HABITUAL CONSTIPATION PERMANENTLY.
Its perfect freedom from every objectionable quality and substance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and. bowels, gently yet promptly, without weakening or irritating them, make it the ideal laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs are used, as they are pleasant to the taste, but
THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES ARE OBTAINED FROM SENNA AND OTHER AROMATIC PLANTS,
by a method known to the California Fig Syrup Company only. In order to get its beneficial effects, and
to avoid imitations, please remember the full name of the Company printed on the front of ever}- package.
Consumers of the choicest products of modern commerce purchase at about the same price that others
pay for cheap and worthless imitations. To come into universal demand and to be everywhere considered
.he best of its class, an article must be capable of satisfying the wants and tastes of the best informed
purchasers: The California Fig Syrup Company having met with the highest success in the manufacture
and sale of its excellent liquid laxative remedy, Syrup of Figs, it has become important to all to have a
knowledge of the Company and its product. The California Fig Syrup Company was organized more than
fifteen years ago, for the special purpose of manufacturing and selling a laxative remedy which would be
more pleasant to the taste and more beneficial in effect than any other known. The great value of the
remedy, as a medicinal agent and of the Company's efforts, is attested by the sale of millions of bottles
annually, and by the high approval of most eminent physicians. As the true and genuine remedy named
Syrup of Figs is manufactured by the California Fig Syrup Company only, the knowledge of that fact
will assist in avoiding the worthless imitations manufactured by other parties. '

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May .'..âThe stock market was
of a highly professional order to-day. and al
though support appeared from time to time
in particular stocks, the tone was weak prac
tically throushout the day. Tic Grangers,
Coalers and a number of the specialties, parti
cularly Brooklyn Transit, People's Gas, Sugar.
American Steel and Wire, Continental To
bacco and Anaconda, were weak. The fever-
Ishness of prices, accompanied by bear pressure
induced considerable liquidation. London was
a purchaser to a moderate amount, but not
enough to sustain the international stocks.
AMiile the bank statement can never be fore
casted with any accuracy, it Is known that the
banks on out-of-town express movement and
sub-treasury operations sustained a loss in cash
of about 8600.000. This, together with the un
derstanding that to-morrow's statement would
not reflect the $5,000,000 debit on account of the
Spanlsn indemnity payment, led traders to as
sume that the wing will not be altogether
favorable, because of the financing of indus
trials and the subscriptions to the Amalga
mated Copper Company. The understanding,
however, that the sub-treasury will cash $1 -.
-000.060 Indemnity warrants next week was re
garded as likely to make a large addition to the
loanable funds, which will be reflected in sub
sequent bank statements. Domestic news was
scarce, but the possibility of complications over
Transvaal afairs received some notice There
was some liquidation of marginal holdings by
speculators discouraged at the seeming lack
of inside sunport In certain properties and the
confident -.perations of the bears. The market
closed 'â vsk at about the lowest.
A fairly good tone was maintained through
out the day in bends, which moved in sym
pathy with stock trading, although a "few
prominent issues were under pressure. Total
sales. $2, 665.000.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 5.â Bradst reefs financial
review to-morrow will say:
Roth the temper and tendencies of the stock
market have varied considerably this" week.
! The activity was not striking and there was an
| Increased preponderance of manipulation, with
I a shrinkage In the commission house business.
! More or less lack of unison between the various
j parts of the list was observed, the standard
| railroad shares being generally 'dull or heavy,
| and the chief strength was confined to the I
I steel stocks and th.- Flower specialties, while
j gas securities, the anthracite group and sugar
were the leading examples ot positive weak
j ness. At the beginning of the week a down
j ward movement of some consequence seemed to
' be at hand, based on the Ford franchise tax
bill Just adopted by the New York Legislature,
and on the tear that the process of transferring
; the 820,000,000 Spanish indemnity to Europe
! might lead to gold exports, or to severe dis
turbances of the money market, but assurances
being given that the National City Bank of
New -York and the Deutsch Rank of Berlin,
which had undertaken the task of turning tic
indemnity over to the Bank of Spain, had vir
tually financed, the operation in advarre, and
eliminated danger of its unsettling theV-meri
i can money market, speculation at once assumed
| a more confident tone. The completion of the
May 1 disbursements, which had temporarily
reduced the supply of funds in the money mar
- ket, was another factor, while It was realized
that the Ford franchise tax law In New York
would not become operative for a year. The
rally which the stock market exhibited was led
by the Flower stocks, Brooklyn Rapid Transit
hading the movement. In fact, that group,
including the gas companies, showed th effect
of decided manipulative support. The chief
bullish demonstrations were, however, in the
steel and iron stocks. National Steel, American
Steel and Wire and American Steel Hoop shares '
riding to the reports that a plan is on foot
to combine those and other similar properties
with the Carnegie steel industries. The heavi
ness of gas stocks, due to the outbreak of Mo- ]
lent competitive cutting of prices by the New
i York local companies, however, hardly affected
i the general list, and the renewed weakness
which made its appearance on Thursday was
attributed largely to the bearish tendency of
the London market. The foreigners had. on the
whole, seemed inclined to buy during the early
. part of the week, but a break In the Kaffir
i mining market and a poor Hank of England re
! turn resulted In pronounced selling, which had
; its effect on the standard railroad stocks, al
ready rendered dull by th continued uncer- [
tainty about crop results and prospects and the
probability of poor net earnings returned by the 'â 
| leading granger roads for the month of March.
Another incident was a ten-point break In
American Sugar, accompanying reports that the :
effort to secure an adjustment of the trade war
| has fallen through, though support rallied the
I stock from the lowest. As a whole the market
I presented a much more Irregular appearance.
| and though manipulative, support by a large
' Interest is conspicuously present, it does not
compensate for the disappearance of the former :
heavy public buying power, nor altogether over
, come the renewed tendency of the board room
professionals and their leaders to act on the
short side of the account from time to time.
DUN'S WEEKLY" REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW yORK, May 5.â R. G. Dun &- Co., In
, their weekly review of trade to-morrow will
say:
The failures In April were the smallest in
- any month since records by months began, 38
, : per cent smaller than In April of last year,
not a third of the amount in IV.-7. and not half
! the amount of April of any previous year.
; Both in manufacturing and in trading they
I were the smallest ever known in that month,
and in trading the smallest ever known in
', any month. The. ratio through clearing
i | houses was less than 70 cents per $1000,
I | against SO cents in January and Jl 19 in .'
March: $7 89 in August and 88 02 In Sep
tember, 1896. A great share of the risk
in the business world has been eliminate. l.
It is not inconsistent nor strange if business
halts, because it has been crowded to the ut
most for four months in anticipating future
needs on account of new combinations pro
' posed. In some .as.-.-, prices have been ad
vanced so far as to check new business, and
i in others works have been engaged bo tar
ahead that new *â¢ orders cannot be taken. Yet
: new business in amount which would have â 
1 been astonishing two years ago. Is still com- !
. ing forward, and the voluntary advance in
wages by the firm's central association, and
i by the I'ri.k coke works, whose shipments in
April.. 30.462 cars, were the heaviest ever
' known, show confidence In the future. At
Buffalo and In Idaho strikes are causing
i trouble, but labor Questions elsewhere do not
affect general business.
The grain market has fallen off. only 2,464,148 j
bushels having been received at the West dur- ]
ing the week, against- 4 76.'.. bushels last
year, and of corn only 2,672,417 bushels have
been exported, against 4,645,749 bushels last
year, while wheat exports from both coUstS
1 have been better. 1,546,767 bushels, flour in- j
I eluded, against 2,545,237 bushels last year.
' Nearly all iron works are crowded for months
ahead, but p. good many are catching up with
their orders, which have recently diminished.
The report that all the great companies are
i to be melted Into one influences the stock mar
ket, but is still scarcely credited, and the rais
ing of foreign prices where American compe
tition Is no longer felt is suggestive. Pig is i
i nowhere higher, nor has any class of finished
i products established higher prices, though in '
. ' many the demand exceeds supplies. London
speculation made a higher price for tin at
825 85, although Atlantic receipts in April, 5105
tons, were the largest on record, and copper
is stronger at $19 25 for Lake, although Euro
i pean stocks are rising.
Shipments of boots and shoes from the East
in five weeks have been but 14. 8 per cent larger
than last year, 14 per cent larger than in the
next largest year, 1895, and 44 per cent larger
than In 1892. Factories, are busy for orders for
i months at old prices, and 2% cents advance is
paid on new orders for several grades. But the
only change in leather Is a small advance In
Union sole, and hides are half of one per cent
. stronger at Chicago.
Wool sales for the week have been large, 8,
--. 859,853 pounds, owing to sales of over 1.000.000
pounds Australian In bond for export, and
Â» heavy speculative purchases of Territory. The
i I wool year ends with heavy stocks on hand and
i prices about 10 per cent lower than last year,
i British prices averaging about 11 per cent
: higher for Australian fine, but about 10 per
cent lower for English and crossbred wools.
i Sales of domestic wool In four months have
i been 83,698,785 pounds, more than In any year
excepting 1897, when speculators were taking in
i the heavy stocks, which some of them have
recently been selling at a loss, but sales of for
eign have been 31,723,503 pounds for the year,
. against 92,-64,350 pounds In that â¢.â¢ear. The
' market in goods is a little stronger, with an
1 advance in clay mixtures, but- in general Is
waiting for the' outcome of new combinations.
â¢ and about some of- these there is still doubt
whether they will be completed. The worsted
combination has gone into operation, but with
out Interfering With deliveries of goods under
previous orders. The cotton goods market Is
the most steady because some strikes still limit
> / production a little, but is quite encouraging
i and active, and in some staples has further ad
vanced.
Failures for the -week have been 158 In the
1 United States, against 238 last year, and 23 in
Canada, against 25 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May s.â Perfect weather and lib
! eral Argentine shipments for the week Induced
liquidation and short selling In the wheat pit
at the opening of the day, and the market
continued to sag under Its load until the close.
A number of step-lose orders were met with
as the market declined. The threatened spread
of the Buffalo strike, which. if it materialized,
would prevent the movement of grain by the
lake route, had a bearish influence. Had crop
.its were ignored. July opened unchanged
at 72%@72%c, declined to 71% c and closed at
71-V
--[favorable seeding weather and fears of a

NORTHERN WHEAT MARKET.
OREGON.
PORTLAND. Or.. May 5.â A slight Improve
i ment In the Liverpool market noted to-day was
not sufficient to stand off the advance In
freights, which went up a notch. Until some
Idle tonnage accumulates, freights will prob
ably absorb any advance that may occur in
the foreign market. Walla Walla easy at > /

NEW YORK RAISIN MARKET.
NEW York, May s.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The effect: of the report from
Fresno that the California Raisin Growers'
Association will retain its control of the mar
ket for another year was not perceptible in the
market for spot Raisins. Had It come earlier
' it might have caused an advance in prices, but
as the season here Is virtually over it was prac
â  tically without influence. Spot stocks of all
â  descriptions In first hands are reported to be
, more closely cleaned up than for many years at
I this season, and what remains is In the hands
of holders who would prefer to put the stock
I Into cold storage rather than* to accept a shade
less than current market .values. Distributors
. appear to be well supplied, and In view of the
j dull condition of the consuming trade, are not
I dispose. to add to their stocks, but any In
crease in the demand would probably cause an
i immediate advance In spot prices. Â«

per pound. Defective and Southern spring
wools, also defective fall wools, do not seem
to respond. For Nevada and all free choice
wools there is an active Inquiry and a great
deal of wool has been sold. Mostly all of the
middle county and Northern wools have been
bought up In the country at prices ranging
from 10c to 12c. Choice Nevada can also be i
quoted at the same price.
"A great deal of buying on speculation is
reported in the Eastern market, especially In
Australian and territory wools. There has
been very little buying by manufacturers.
Prices are firm and holders of wool have raised
asking prices.
"The London sales which opened May 2 are
reported from 15 to 20 per cent higher on fine
wools and they are higher to-day In London
than they are in the United States, and a great

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been two arrivals of coal from
Washington, with 6356 tons; two from Oregon,
850 tons; total, 7208 tons. The quantity coming
to hand since my last report is exceptionally
light, not equal to two days' actual consump
tion; this for the moment makes no radical
change, as there is sufficient fuel here for all
Immediate calls, at the same time stocks in
yard are diminishing. Last year a number of
large coal consumers changed their machinery
and are now utilizing crude oil for fuel, which
they claim is more economical and convenient
for their purposes. Any marked reduction in
the price of coal will again find them con
suming coal in preference to oil. No foreign
coals have arrived this week, in fact, the quan
tity of foreign at hand so far this year Is ex
ceedingly small; we may naturally look for
increased shipments later in the year, as most
of our grain carriers outward will be coal
carriers Inward. Coal freights from Australia
and Great Britain are still firm for later load
ing." -^

A TRANSPORT SPEAKING A DERELICT.
THE tramp steamer Elihu Thomson, while on her way from Honolulu to San Francisco, lost her pro
peller, and was left at the mercy of the wind and waves. The transport Senator, from San Francisco
for Manila, spoke the derelict and took off twelve of the crew and one passenger. The captain and offi
cers and eight men stayed by the ship. The tug Relief went out last night to search for the derelict and
bring her into port.
pi ess on the face of the deep. Captain
Patterson offered to take tit.- entire crew
of the derelict aboard, but Captain Whit
ney decided to stand by his vessel. As he
had only one serviceable lifeboat, how
ever, he decided to keep eight men aboard
and put the others on the Senator. Those
who were transferred to the Senator were
S. Fulm< Purser Bryan and eleven fire
men and coal passers. Two months' sup
plies were put aboard the Thomson and
the Senator steamed away for Honolulu.
The derelict was then in latitude 34 deg.
2 mm. .north, longitude 132 deg. 14 mm.
west.
Early on Tuesday morning last the Sen
ator and Moana met. Captain Patterson
signaled that he wanted to communicate
so Captain Carey stopped his vessel. A
boat was lowered from the Senator and
the thirteen men from the Elihu Thomson
were put aboard the mall boat. When the
Thomson and Senator parted company
Captain Whitney told Captain Patterson
that he ligured his vessel would drift
twelve miles off the regular course every
twenty-four hours. When Captain Carey
reached the position in which the derelict
was last seen he searched for eighty
miles in every direction, but could find
no trace of her. As the mails had to be

her course and arrived here yesterday

look for the derelict took a fortnight's
supply of coal along. Upon reaching the
latitude and longitude given by the
Moana, Captain Clem Randall will begin
a systematic search for the missing ves
sel. If successful the. Relief should get
back the latter part of next week.
The Moana reached Apia in time to see
the warships shelling the town. The na
tives were not to be seen, as they were
back in the brush, but many of them
were supposed to have been killed. A
few passengers from Samoa came up on
the steamer, but all are afraid to talk,
as they are in business in Apia. W. E.
Cochrane says Malietoa is King just as
far as the American and British guns
can carry, and that everywhere else Ma*
taafa reigns supreme. He considers the
war a disgrace to civilization, and says
he believes Captain White of the Phila
delphia and the captain of the British
cruiser Tauranga were opposed to Admi
ral Kautz's programme. According to
Cochrane Mataafa and his thirteen chiefs
gave the best government to Samoa the
Islands had ever Known. Mali' tea ho
calls a stripling called into power by the
London Missionary' Society, and he as
serts thai the whole trouble is largely
due to "jingoes" from New Zealand, who
want to gain control of affairs.
On the evening of April 24 Dr. Robert
McÃurney. surgeon of the Moana. died
of congest) of the lungs. He was taken
sick a few days after leaving Auckland
and he died almost as the ship came in
sight of Samoa. His remains were bur
ied at Apia, the ship's crew attending the
funeral in a body.
The transport Newport had not reached
Honolulu when the Moana left there, on
April 28, at 11 p. m. The Rio de Janeiro.
Newport and Warren left here in the or
der named on April 20. On April 27 the
Rio reached Honolulu and the Warren
made port a few hours later. .The New
port is a faster vessel than either the
Rio I. Janeiro or Warren, but her long
passage may be accounted for by the fact
that she is under charter by the day,
while the Rio carries the mall and ha
te' make her run on schedule time, and
the Warren is a Government vessel. No
anxiety is felt for the safety of the New
port. She is simply saving coal, and
Uncle Sam is paying $800 a day for it.
The Moana brings the news that the
German cruiser Cormoran while on her
wav from China to Samoa went on a reef
in 'the Bismarck archipelago. For six \
days she hung on to the ledge between j
Kaiser Wllhelmland and New Ireland,
and she was only got off after her guns
had been moved aft. She finally reached
Brisbane, and was to go to Sydney, N.
S. XV., to be put on the drydock for re
pairs. j

AILYAR MADE A GALLOP OF THE
HANDICAP.
â¦ -
Heigh Ho Downed Horatio a Scant
Head â May McCarty, Played for
a Killing-, Practically Left
at the Post.
The winning horses at Oakland yester
day were difficult to pick and the books
recouped their losses of the day before.
Benroe, Heigh Ho and Allyar were the
successful favorites.
The Burns & Waterhouse colt San !
Tomas again proved a disappointment in \
the opening two-year-old dash. Heavily
played at odds of 6 to 5, the youngster
finished third. Tar Hill made all the run
ning, beating out Flush of Gold a length
In a drive.
Corrigan's Cabrlllo looked to be nicely
placed in the seven furlong run that fol
lowed, and ruled favorite at 6 to 5. After
racing out in front and killing off the
"warm one," Loch Ness, the Corrigan
entry, was in turn collared and downed a
head by Sevoy, a 25 to l shot, well ridden
by Hahn. 1
After reeding in the betting from 2 to
4 to 1, Benroe captured the third number
on the. card, a six furlong sprint. Bill
Dingley had the mount, and moving up in
the stretch from fifth position beat Maj
esty out a head. Ruiz managed to finish
just beyond any part of the money with
the favorite. Bueno. May Met 'arty,
played from 20 down to 6, was practically
left.
Glengaber came out in full enjoyment
of one of his running streaks, placing the
mile selling run to the credit of Hughey
Jones, Passing the favorite, Nilgai*,
astride which McNlchols was hard at
work at the stretch turn, the Morello
horse reached the wire four lengths
ahead of Gilberto. The winner was sec
ond choice In the ring.
Heigh Ho, nicely ridden by Jenkins, car
ried off the fifth purse. The mare was
blessed throughout with the best of rac
ing luck, and in a fierce drive defeated
Horatio a short head. Glover, on the
latter horse, was interfered with the first
part of the route, or he would have won.
Sly ran third.
The six furlong handicap went to
Allyar, the 2 to 6 favorite, which won
easily from Genua.

Abolish the Death Penalty.
At Albany the law-makers are wrangling
over the abolition of the death penalty. The
man who succeeds in passing such a bill will
prove as greut a benefactor to the breaker of
man's laws as Hostetter's Stomach Bitters has
to the breaker of nature's laws. If you've
nesltot<'d your stomach until indigestion, con-
Btlpation, biliousness, livÂ»>r and kidney troubles
are upon you there's but one cureâ Hostetter's
Stomach Hitters. Don't fall to try it. All
druggists sell it.

MORE BEATEN

Cannot Capture the
Local Travel.

WITHDRAWS ITS TRAINS
â â¦ â
OPPOSITION TO HAYWARDS IS
VICTORIOUS.

The Hourly Service Has Been Abol

Two Years.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May i.
The Southern Pacific Railroad lias j
given up its light against the Haywards
electric ad. having been thoroughly
beaten; and has withdrawn from the con- ]
test. This fact will be made known In
a few days, when the time-tables now in
course of preparation are Issued.
Two years ago the travel 01 the elec
tric road was so large that the Southern
Pacific determined that it would, If pos- j
Bible] procure a share of it. It announced j
that it would run last local trains to
Haywards from Oakland ever*, hour, and j
as the trip can be made in less than half
an hour it was expected that the nun- ;
dreffs of people who patronized the elec
tric road would be won oyer to the rail
road company, as the fares were the |
same.
This expectation was not realized, ow
ing largely to the fact that when the j
Southern Pacific established its depot at
Haywards it was built about a mile from I
the town, and a railroad iiorsecar line
ran from the junction to Haywards. This
practice o_ building depots .1 mile from -
town has been follewed very largely by j
the Southern Pacific, in the hope that it
would draw the town around its own j
property. In many instances it has sue
< ceded," but in the case of Haywards it.
was a dire failure, and the depot m the
marsh has never been used except by \
those who were forced to patronize it.
The electric road from Oakland to Hay
wards, wnich was opened about five years
a_.i. runs along the county road and dl
rectly through the town of Hayward as I
well "a through all the little towns en j
route. The half hourly service proved
more acceptable than the hourly service
of the Southern Pacific, although the time,
occupied is twice as long. For a long time
the hourly train left the pier and ran to
Haywards. It consisted of a lone coach
and locomotive and presented a solitary
appearance Hying along the marsh, fre
quently with not more than one or two
passengers in it. So easy has the travel
become that the conductor was frequently !
joked about taking his sleep when on the ,
Haywards local.
A few months ago about half of the
local trains were withdrawn, more re
cently all but two or three were taken off:
and now information is given out at the :
pier that the tight is entirely ended. The
new time-tables will show no hourly ;
trains to Haywards, and no more than
there were before the electric road carved j
all thai was worth having out of the local j
travel.
CONSTABLES KEPT AT
BAY BY A WOMAN
TOR MONTHS SHE HAS BEEN A
LOCAL TERROR.
Pulls Out Her Hair on the Street and
Threatens to End the Careers
of Her Neighbors.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
90S Broadway, May 5.
Constables Weedier and Williamson and
a small army of deputies were lgnominl
ously beaten to-day by an old woman. < In
Valley street lives a Mrs. O'Connell, who
for a long time has been a cans, of an
noyance to the neighbors and the trouble
is steadily increasing. Mrs. O'Connell Is
believed to be suffering from mental aber
ration. She has never yet done any phys
ical Injury' except to herself, and this ha.-*
consisted of going out on the street oc
casionally and tearing tufts of hair from
her head. She has made serious threats
against all her neighbors.
Complaint had been made to the con
stables, and having, procured sufficient
evidence to at least justify an examina
tion by the Lunacy Commission into Mrs.
O'Connell's condition, the tables went
to the house this afternoon to escort the
lady to the Receiving Hospital. They
came back without her.
Mrs. O'Connell saw the stables ap
proaching the house, flew in, locked the
doors; bolted the windows, pulled down
the blinds and finally peered out of an
upper window, amusing herself by invit
ing the outwitted constables to come in.
Every effort was made i. effect a peace
able entrance, but as there was no justifi
cation to accept the lady's invitation by
the help of force, the peace officers re
tired.
Armed with a warrant they will storm
Mrs. O'Connell's citadel to-morrow. A
hard task is anticipate.! as it is believed
the lady has fortified herself against In
truders.

MINISTER OF LANDS
FOR NEW ZEALAND
HON. JOHN McKENZIE, M.P.
HON. JOHN McKENZIE, Minister of Lands and Agriculture for New
Zealand and member of Parliament representing the county elector
all of Walhemo, arrived on the Moana with his wife and daughter
yesterday and engaged apartments at the Occidental. Mr. McKenzle
Is on his way to his birthplace, Ardross, In Rosshlre. Scotland, and will be
absent from' the colonies for about seven months, returning In time for the
January elections. He will also visit England on official business. - : ;'
Mr. McKenzle has been a power in New Zealand politics for the past
thirty years and has an unbeaten record. He Is of the Liberal party, which
has been in power since 890, and he has held his present office since that time.
He Is the most advanced land legislator in the world and is the author of
the land for settlement act, which has done more fur his Government than
all other legislation combined. This act enables Parliament to appropriate
money for the purchase of large estates from the owners and cutting' them
up In small areas. In speaking on the subject last evening, Mr. McKenzle
said:
4- "Large numbers of settlers have taken advantage of this act, which may *â¦"
i"- said to be the mainstay of our Government. During the five years the -â¦-
act has been In operation fifty-eight estates, comprising 245,534 acres, have 4
"*" been purchased at a cost of Â£1,216,482. The lands are not resold, but a 999- a
"*" year lease is given, which practically allows the benefit of the freehold to
*â¦â  the new tenant. Seven hundred houses have been erected, from which Â£61.497 "*"
4- is derived in rentals. The Cheviot estate, which was recently purchased by "â¦"
li. a special act for Â£371,000 for its 84,000 acres, rents for Â£14,500 a year. While the -â¦-
population was only eighty when the estate was bought, there are now over 4.
1500 people within Its confines. The Government exacts a return of 5 per cent +.
â *" on the purchase price in rentals and the settlers are In a prosperous condition. .
â¦ "We have established an agricultural department in connection with the Z.
"T. Land Office, which bar- also accomplished a great deal of good. Connected
+ with it are a biologist, entomologist, veterinary surgeons, fruit and poultry
+ experts, dairy commission, dairy instructor, dairy produce graders and In- "**"
.4. ectors of stock. These last instruct the people where factories are started *â¦*
for the manufacture of dairy produce. In the winter months dairy schools -4.
are established, where applicants are Instructed to become dairy experts. +
â *â  The dairy industry act, which ! also fostered, provides for cool cars on
+ railway trains and cool storage at the points of shipment. The produce is
+ graded by the dairy graders and a report sent to the consignor and the con- "***'
+ slgnee. *â¦*
"Last year we exported 106,840 hundredweight of butter and 78,705 hundred- -â¦â¢
weight of cheese at a marketable price of over a million sterling. New 2_ea- _*.
**" land produced over 12,000,000 bushels of wheat last year and exported 7,000,000 .
"â¦" bushels. There was also exported nearly 70,000 hundredweight of frozen beef,
4- worth Â£75.00); nearly two million hundredweight of frozen mutton, worth one "*"
> million sterling; over a million carcasses of frozen lambs. \worth Â£600,000, and *â¦*
V 148,179,108 pounds of white wool, worth nearly five millions Sterling. When it +
is known that much of this is produced by the small tenants working under +
"*" the land act, an Idea of the complete success of the system may be ob- .
â *-*" tallied. This year's appropriation for purchasing estates is Â£500,000."

.* t| received by the Chief of Police yesterday "positively Identified" the un- cÂ»

'. of Oakland, and who remembered distinctly fitting the old man with cast- â¦'
â¦ off garments at the Army Shelter in this city. Nothing could be doubtful *Â£
SD? about the identification, for Captain Creuss, the writer, remembered well the -*
â¦ peculiar malformation ,of the left thumb, which' feature was carefully set V
_ forth in the published descriptions of the unfortunate man. Â£_
â¦ To-day the police reported that the man almost sworn to as being in his *
V grave, a battered corpse, is Josiah Harding, who is a -simile of the pho- *Â£

â¦ times, and in each instance he has turned up and very forcefully declared â¦
i _ that be is alive. His hair, boot, thumb, trousers and nose have been recog- it
i<Â£ nlzed by friends, and still the mystery is as mysterious as ever. â¦

â > â
A VICTORY FOR CALIFORNIA
â â¦ â
KENNEL CLUB SHOW WILL
CLOSE THIS EVENING.
ââ+
A Parade of All the Successful Candi
dates and Auction Sales Both
in the Afternoon and
Evening.
As the annual dog show of the San Fran- '
Cisco Kennel Club at Mechanics' Pavilion
draws nearer a close the attendance has
Increased noticeably. All day yesterday
âboth afternoon and eveningâ aisles
of the Pavilion were thronged with dog
fanciers.
A ringful of fox-terriers enlivened the j
proceedings during the afternoon. These j
pugnacious little animals struggled with
their handlers in a vain effort to mix mat
ters with other blue-blooded members of
the same family. There was spirited com
petition in this class between the Califor
nia-bred dogs of Dominick Shannon and
those belonging to Rev. J. W. Flinton of
Victoria, B. C. in the puppy class for
dogs Dr. Flinton's Aldon Artist, a winner
at the New York show, was placed first
and Mr. Shannon's Scorcher second. In
the puppy class for bitches Mr. Shannon's
Santa Rosa was awarded the blue ribbon,
the red going to Dr. I-llinton's Victoria
Judy. In the limit class J. B. .Martin's
Golden Sunshine won.
The bench of collies shown by .Verona
kennels presented a pretty picture.' Vero
na Broker, a Verona bred dog now owned
by Joseph 1.. Eppinger, proved a surprise
in the ring. He won first in the puppy
class, novice dogs, limit dogs, open dons
and winners" classesâ a clean sweep of all
the honors
One of the most attractive exhibits in
the show is a kennel of seven pointer pup
pies shown by Al Barker of San Jose,
their breeder. They are all nicely marked
and are as active and playful as kittens.
The toy terriers, other than Yorkshires,
were judged late in the afternoon. J. C.
Farley's Moxie carried off the blue rib
bon of honor. The same owner's Midget
captured, the red and Mrs. W. A. Burns'
Muggins third. The dogs are all of the
same family, having been bred by Mr.
Farley.
There is a strange diversity of opinion j
as to the ability of Judge Lacy. All the
winning owners are loud in his praise,
saying he is the best judge ever seen
here. On the other hand the losers are
apparently unable to solve the question
as to who told him he knew anything
about dogs. ;.'â â¢'.
The show will close to-night. The spe
cials will be judged this afternoon, after
which there will be a parade of the win
ning dogs. This will be repeated in the
evening. There will also be an innova
tion in the form of an auction sale, both
afternoon and evening. Dogs of all
breeds will be offered, thus affording an
excellent opportunity for fanciers to ob
tain prize-winning dogs. The judging
yesterday resulted as follows:

OFFICE HOLDERS MAY
DEFEAT THE CHARTER
Form a Trust, Contribute Funds
and Employ Legal Counsel.
Beginning of an Organized Effort to Render Invalid
the City's New Organic Law â Will Try
to Prevent an Election.
THE office holders of the city and
county of San Francisco have
-formed a. trust and subscribed to
a fund for the purpose of defeat
ing the provisions of the new
charter. Legal counsel has been em
ployed and as soon as the necessary
steps can be taken the aid of the courts
will be invoked to prevent the holding
of a primary election and a municipal
election for the purpose of electing offi
cers of the city and county as provided
for by the charter.
For reasons that are apparent the
movement by which the office holders
have banded themselves together has
been kept secret until all of the Inter
ested officials had pledged themselves
to lend moral and financial support to
the scheme to defeat the new organic
law So far as can be learned but two
of the officers of the municipal govern
ment have refused to enter into the
compact. These are Mayor Phelan and
City and County Attorney Lane.
"I refused to become a party to the
scheme," said Attorney Lane yesterday,
â¢â¢because to do so 1 would have to
stultify myself and violate my own
conscience and the expressed wishes of
the people who elected me. Some time
ttgo an attorney came to me and asked
me how much I was willing to contrib
ute to a fund to fight the charter and
its provisions as regards the terms of
present 'dice holders. 11-' was willing,
he said, i" guarantee that 1 should hold
office at least two years. I Informed
him that I would not consider the prop
osition for the reason that I was in
favor of the charter, had worked for it
and wanted to Bee its provisions car
ried into effect. That ended the mat
ter so far as I was concerned, but I am
informed that wit* the exception of
Mayor Phelan and possibly one other
official all of the present office holders
under the municipal government have
entered into the combination and will
light the provisions of the charter to
the titter end.
"So far as 1 am concerned, when my
successor is elected under the pro
visions of the charter I will step down
and out without a word of protest."
Attorney A. Hue:' has been selected
as the legal representative of the office
holders' trust and he is now at work
preparing an extensive brief upon
which the contention of his clients is to
be supported in the courts. As soon
as he has completed this preparatory
work active measures will 1" taken to
prevent the election of the successors
of the men who claim the right to hold
office contrary to the provisions of the
new â .barter.
"I am not at liberty at this time to
discuss the particulars of the fight that
we will make against the charter," Lid
Attorney Ruef yesterday, "but you may
quote me as saying that there Is not a
shadow of a doubt but that the pro
visions of the charter, so far as they
apply to present Bee holders, will be
declared invalid by the courts. It may
1..- that the entire charter will be de
clared invalid, unconstitutional and
void. I have been employed to take
the initial steps in the matter and have
mv brief almost completed.
"I do not care to disclose the -rounds
on which the provisions of the charter
and the charter itself will be attacked.
1 can only say in a general way that
we believe th" county officers may hold
their offices for the full four years for
which they were elected, and that the
provisions of the charter which would
limit their tenure of office to "tie year
are unconstitutional. As to the city
officers we hold that they are entitled
to hold office for the full two years for
which they were elected for the reason
that the whole charter is invalid. I do
not think it wise to point out the law
upon which we will base our conten
tion, but we have not the least doubt
of our ability to accomplish all that we
propose to do and when the matter
comes up in the courts we will explode
ii bombshell that will be a big surprise
to some people."
If what Attorney Ruef says be true
then all of the time and money and all
of the laborious and painstaking work
that was necessary to frame th.- char
ter fend secure its ratification by the
Legislature has been thrown away.
Not "illy this, but the litigation that
Is about to be precipitated by the office
holders will involve the city and its
affairs in a legal controversy that will
require the expenditure of a great
amount of money and will throw the
affairs of government into such a hope
less tangle as will result in irremedi
able loss and confusion.
Those office holders who are known to
have entered into the compact to defeat
the charter and retain their official po
sitions beyond tin* time contemplated
by the new organic law decline to dis
cuss th" matter or to even admit that
they intend to appeal to the courts.
They simply refuse to discuss the sub
ject and dismiss all questioners with
the equivocal statement: "Wait till
the time comes. We are not yet pre
pared to discuss the matter."
From hints dropped here and there
it is conjectured that the contention of
the mincers, so far as county officers
are concerned, will be based on the

section of the constitution which pro
vides that all county governments
shall be uniform in their nature. The
new charter provides that county offi
cers shall hold office for two years,
while the county government act pro
vides that the term of office of all
county officials shall be four years. It
will also be held that under one of the i
provisions of the constitution, in ac- j
cordance with which the charter was
drafted, no power is legated to i
curtail the terms of office of officers
elected prior to the adoption of the j
charter. The section referred to reads
as follows:
Where a city ami county government
has been merged and consolidated into
one municipal government; it shall also j
be competent in any charter framed un
dy said section 8 of said article II ,to
provide for the manner in which, the ;
times at which, and the terms for which
the several county officers shall be elect
ed or appointed, for their compensation,
and for the number of deputies that each
shall have, and for the compensation
payable to each of such deputies. (Amend
ment adopted November 3, 1896.)
F. W. Dohrmann, to whose efforts is
largely due the framing and adoption
of the new charter, believes that the
movement to test the legality of the
charter will result in ultimate benefit
to the city.
"I understand that the county officers
will attempt to hold their offices for the
four-year term In spite of the provisions
of the charter," said Mr. Dohrmann yes
terday, "but 1 have no positive informa
tion on the subject. I have also heard
that the city officers will contest the elec
tion of their successors under the pro
visions of the charter. So far as I re
member the Board of Freeholders did not
consider the question of the constitution
ality of changing the terms .of county
officers from four to two years. We took
it for granted th.it the Legislature has
the power by the ratification of the char
ter to legalize the provisions of that in
strument.
"1; is not to be presumed that an in
strument such as the new charter is can
be put into force and effect without hav
ing its legality and constitutionality
brought Into question. In fact, it is very
desirable that this should be done in
order that there may be in future no
question as to the stability of its pro
visions. The sooner the matter Is tested,
both as to the charter as a whole and as
to Its separate provisions, the better it
will be for the people of the city. If the
present officers of the city and county-
Intend to make this test I, for one, will
not object.
"As a layman I do not care to express
an opinion at this time as to the merits
of the contention that the provisions of
the charter do not affect the county offi
cers who were elected last November. It
is a legal question which the Supreme
Court will have to decide. I will* say.
however, that even if it should be held
that the county officers are entitled to
hold office for the term of four years for
which they were elected. I am of the
opinion that such a ruling would have
no bearing on the standing of their depu
ties and the other attaches of their vari
ous offices.
"If the law is so construed as to ex
empt the present county office holders
from the provisions of the charter such
construction could not be extended to
cover the employment of their ap
point) these, 1 take it, will in any
event come at once under the rules and
provisions of the civil service clauses of
the charter. This being so. it cannot make
a great amount of difference whether or
not the present county officers extend
the term of their incumbency to the end
of th" four year period. If they are good
officers that is all that is desired, and if
the conduct of their offices comes under
the civil service provision of the charter
this cltv will be none the loser.
"As 1 Bald before, the charter will have
to stand the test of the courts, and the
sooner such test is made the better. If
the test is mad.- in the manner intimated
by the present office holders various com
plications will ensue which will in turn
have to be submitted to the decision of
the courts. For instance, the charter
abolishes some offices and creates others,
as in the case of the City and County
Surveyor. This office Is abolished by the
provisions of the charter and In its stead
the office of City Engineer Is created,
Should the courts hold that the city and
County Surveyor, as a county officer, Is
entitled to hold office to the end of the
four year term for which he was elected,
then will arise the question of the pow
ers and duties of the City Engineer who
will be elected next November. These
things, as I say, will have to be settled
by tne courts and If the question of their
settlement can be expedited in any way
the entire community will be benefited.
"What l have said is based on the sup
position that some action is contemplated
by the present office holders looking to
ward securing for themselves the right
to hold office for the full term for which
they were elected, I have no knowledge
that this will lie done, however, and It
may p.- possible that it will not be. The
first election under the charter may be
proceeded with without any trouble of
any hind, which would have the effect, of
course, of making operative from the
very beginning all of the provisions of
the city's new organic law."

LIVES A WHOLE
YEAR WITHOUT
A STOMACH
Juan Patritti a Medi
cal Marvel.
â â¦ â
IS SLEEK, FAT AND HEALTHY
â â
HIS DIGESTIVE ORGAN WAS RE
MOVED A YEAR AGO.
Â» .
The Dairyman Eats Everything
From Raviola to Roast Pork,
Drinks Wine and Does
Hard Work.
An Italian named Juan Patrltti has up
! set all preconceived ideas in regard to di
gestion and nutrition. Without a stomach
and consequently without the assistance
of the gastric juices he digests and grows
: fat on soups, spaghetti, ravlola, tamales,
beef, mutton and pork, properly seasoned
with garlic and drinks his usual allow
i ance of wine.
A year ago Patritti was dying of a can
cer of the stomach. To-day lie is halo and
hearty, does his day's work at plowing or

driving a milk wagon and does not know
what dyspepsia means. During, the past
year Patritti has dune so well that he has
purchased a ticket for Europe and next
week he starts on a trip to Italy to visit
his old home.
Patritti's case is the. .only one of its
kind known to medical science. The first
operation for the removal of the stomach
was in Zurich, Switzerland. The patient
was a woman and after her stomach had
been removed -she lived two - years,'- but
was fed on peptonized I food. Another
ca^e was that of Mrs. Magendie, who had
her stomach removed in the German' Hos
pital in this city eighteen months ago.
She is still alive and lives on peptonized
food; but Patritti eats and lives just the
same as he did before' bis stomach was
removed and bis only complaint is that
now he can only work eight* hours a day
instead of ten, as formerly. â 
Patritti is a dairyman in San Mateo
County and 39 years of age. ' About this
time last year he was admitted .to St.
Mary's Hospital and Dr. George Childs
Macdonald diagnosed the case as one- of
cancer of the stomach. It was gathered
from the patient that he had been sick
and unable to work for about three
months. Before that he had never been
sick in bis life. He was very much ema
ciated and weak and subject to violent
paroxysms of vomiting. The case seemed
hopeless, but the doctor decided as a last
resort to remove the whole of the stom
ach. With the assistance of Mrs. Fra
zer, Kingwell. McMonogal and Bailey.
Dr. Macdonald successfully performed the
operation, but the patient was almost in
a state of collapse when it was over. He
gradually rallied, however, and soon was
on the road to recovery.
A month after the operation Patritti
thought he was well "enough to go home,
so without asking anybody's leave he
slipped out of the hospital and was met
on Market street during the afternoon by
Dr. Macdonald carrying a gripsack weigh
ing twelve pounds.- He objected strenu-
sly to being taken back to the hospi
tal, but Dr. Macdonald insisted, and back
he went. He was kept in St. Mary's until
.Inly 28, when he was discharged. At that
time he weighed 107 pounds and he gave
the doctor to understand that his usual
weight was 135 pounds.
From the hospital Patritti went back
to his ranch in San Mateo County and
there he has lived and worked ever since.
He eats the same kind of food as others
in the colony and claims that he can di
gest pork as easily as he can chicken.
A year ago he did not Weigh 100 pounds
and to-day he is within two pounds of his
regular weightâ l3s pounds. A few days
ago he told Dr. Macdonald that he was as
well as ever he was, but grumbled be
cause he got tired when he had been
plowing six or seven hours, whereas be
fore his stomach was cut out he could
work ten hours and not feel tired.
The story of tin- successful operation
has been published in all the European
medical journals. so when Partitti
reaches Italy he will be in demand among
the medical colleges and medical fra
ternity generally. â¢ '.~;

Heroes of the San Rafael Orphan

The report of the officers of the Cali
fornia Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children shows that last month
more work was done than in any month
for the same time. At the meeting held
yesterday Thomas H. Williams Jr. was
elected a life member. Secretary Parnell
reported that the officers had Investigated
th case of Mrs. Golson or Goldstein of
465 Jessie street and found that the peo
ple interested were impostors and that
they are making a fat living by working
upon the sympathies of the public. The
story told Is that the woman's husband
deserted her and her HtUe baby and left
them destitute. Mr. Parnell says the
woman is able to work and that her hus
band seems to be in the conspiracy. The I
Associated Charities has refused to do i
anything for these people for the reason |
given.
The directors decld-d to present to Ru- I
dolph and William Llchtenberg and Mar
garet Blumfield the society's medals of
honor for their bravery in rescuing the
helpless children at the fire of the San
Rafael Orphan Asylum. The report of
the secretary for April showed the fol
lowing business:

RULOFSON'S FIGHT OPENS.
Action to Recover Winslow G. Hall's
Estate Before Judge Belcher.
The action of Alfred C. Rulofson, who
claims to be the legally adopted son of
the late Captain Winslow G. Hall, and
therefore entitled to decedent's entire
estate, against George E. Billings, exe
cutor of Captain Hall's last will, was
taken up yesterday by Judge Belcher.
Noah Brooks, the most important wit-
ness for the defense, was first placed on
the stand with the consent of the plain
tiff, that he might leave the city in the
near future. *
Mr. Brooks, who is at present residing
in the East, but is well known in this
city and State, having been the editor of
the Alta California and Marysville Ap
peal, knew the interested parties in the
present suit well. He testified that he
was aware of the strained relations ex
isting between the plaintiff and his father
at the time it is alleged Captain Hall
adopted the young man. Witness also
was interested in the young man and as
sisted him, but young Rulofson never
confessed to him that he had been
adopted by Captain Hall. Rulofson wrote
him prior to the filing of the suit. He
said he was about to commence an ac
tion to recover Captain Hall's estate, and
asked the witness to try and recall some
knowledge of the time of the plaintiff's
adoption. Mr. Brooks was unable to
recollect that such an adoption had ever
been mentioned to him, and he answered
Rulofson, expressing much surprise at
such a suit.
Mr. Brooks, although a friend of
Captain Hall and the confidant of young
Rulofson, never heard of such an adop
tion. He was unable to say, however,
that such an adoption had not taken
place, but to him it was strange that if
such had come to pass lie was not ap
prised of it. The cross-examination of
Mr. Brooks occupied the remainder of
the sittine., after which the case went
over till Monday.
Reinsteln & Eisner and Reddy, Camp
bell & Metson are representing the plain
tiff, and Chickering, Thomas & Gregory
and Van Ness & Redman are caring for
the Interests of the defendant. Consider
ing the line-up of counsel, an interesting
contest will doubtless spread itself over
several weeks.

ner, the Novelist, at His Bed

Came.
' â â 
John Bonner, one of the best known
j newspaper writers in America, died at his
home in this city last evening. He had
j been practically confined to his home for
a number of months, having given up ac
! tive work for the press during that pe
riod. He was an editorial writer of
marked ability and as a writer on histor
ical events ranked among the foremost in
the world. Three years ago he made a
i vigorous contest for the office of Secre
tary to the Regents of the University of
California, to succeed the late Rev. Dr.
Bonte, but failed of election.
Deceased was born in Quebec, Canada,
seventy years ago. He first came into
prominence as an editorial writer on the
New York Herald. From that he accepted
a position as editor of Harper's Weekly,
finally drifting back to daily newspaper
work, filling tie position of financial edi
tor of the Herald. He made a fortune as
an operator in Wall street, but finally
failed in a sensational manner. He then
came West, stopping at Leadville, Colo.,
where he remained during the years of
IST!' and 1880. Bonner worked for a lime
on the Leadville Chronicle and afterward
' owned the Leadville News. He came to
', this coast in 1881, was employed as an edi
torial writer on the Chronicle and filled
the same position on The Call from 1886
until 1895, with a brief interval on the
Examiner.
Since then he has contributed to the
Argonaut and Wave and also to the Sun
day Chronicle. He was a most prolific
writer, being a man of great energy and
Industry. He has written some notable
historical sketches and was the author
of a series of histories for young people
published by Harpers on Rome. Greece,
France and Germany. Mr. Bonner spent
five or six years in Paris as representa
tive of the New York Herald and while
there became possesed of a fund of his
torical information which he afterward
: utilized In his writings.
He leaves three childrenâ Miss ral dine
Bonner, who was with him when he died,
: and a son and daughter who are In New
: York. Miss Geraldine Bonner is well
] known as a magazine writer and novelist
1 of ability.
. Mr. Bonner's death was the result of a
general breaking down of his system,
caused in part by grief over the death of
his wife, a son and an adopted daughter,
: all within a period of three years.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
j from his late residence, 1900 Valiejo street.

THE DEADLY CAR
"FENDER" AGAIN
FINDS A VICTIM
An old man, apparently between 60 and >
70 years of age, was struck and killed by
Kearny and Mission street car No. 1169 at
the corner of Jackson and East streets
late last night. The victim was shabbily
dressed, and there is no clew to his iden
tity except a letter found on his person
addressed to William Kinkead, house 3,
Almshouse. After the accident an ambu
lance was summoned from the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital, but the old man passed
away before its arrival. He had been
rolled over several times by the alleged
fender and hi* neck was broken.
Patrick the motorman on the ear.
was booked for manslaughter after the
accident. He claims to have been run
ning at about half speed when the old
man stepped on the track. He shouted
to him and set up brakes, but before the
car could be stopped the fatality hap
pened. The body was taken to the Morgue.
Labor Council's Meeting.
The boycott instituted by the Bill-
posters' Union against Slebe & Green was
made a matter of lengthy discussion at
a meeting of the San Francisco Labor
Council last evening. A motion to notify _
theatrical managers that the boycott wa^
on and requesting them to withhold thei'^4
patronage from the objectionable firm
was made and carried. A committee was
appointed to attend to the matter and
urge the cause of the bill-posters, and to
also notify the Allied . Trades and tho
Building Trades Council. The Musicians'
Union asked that a certain club giving
dances in this city be boycotted, but ac
tion was referred to the executive com
mittee. Credentials received from John
I. Nolan as a delegate from the Molders'
Union and. from I. N. Burke of Carpen
ters' Union No. 483 were accepted ' and.
both gentlemen were seated. Delegates
from most of the labor organizations re
ported an increase in business. The sail
ors stated that their fight was still on
with the ship-owners. A milkers' union
was recently- organized, and its affairs
are prospering. The carpenters reported
that many firms had discharged non
union men and that the prospects of
unionizing the city were very bright. The
coopers complained that labor-saving ma
chinery had reduced them a!! to about
half time.
