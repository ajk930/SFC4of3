CAGE APPLIES THE LASH TO LAW
MAKERS OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP BURNS
LEGISLATORS INSULTED BY
THE IMPERIAL GOVERNOR
Considers All Who Vote for Grant as His
Particular Personal Enemies.
Brazen and Unseemly Assumption of Autocratic Power
by the Executive, Who Turns His Office Into
a Burns Senatorial Machine.
â  CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- 1 1
â MEN'TO. Jan. 6.â Governor Gage has
i â  his term of office by offering an ;
every member of the State
Legislature. And th--* insult was of- '
: because the Governor believed !
. that the act would result in the election
of D. M. Burns to the United States
Senate.
Whether the members of the Legisla
ture will take the slap in the face thai
given them by the new Caesar |
without resenting it remains to be seen.
The offense is ton pronounced to be mis
â¢ued or overlooked and it is now
pimply a question of whether the mem- I
f the Legislature will hold out !
their hands to receive the shackles with
. wfrich the Governor and Colonel Burns ;
â¢would bind him or assert their freedom
arvd independence at the risk of losing
B.o : rni9 small "rain of political patronage.
'T- will consider a vote for Grant a
:ifTrnnt."
,'â¢.' Such i? the <leclaration made by Gov
ernor Gage, and this in face of the fact i
that, more than a score of members of
tee Legislature have already openly de
o'iro'l their intention to vote for Grant
: sited States Senator. The can
<H<iacy "f Colonel Burns must indeed be
â¢ .in desperate straits when it becomes I
necessary for his friend, the Governor, â 
to take advantage of his position to at- I
;.ternpt to force them to surrender their I
â¢liberty of conscience, a right that is i
'that of every free-b-rn American citi- [
. zen. Governor Gag^ says in effect:
. . "I will not permit you tc cast your
vote for Grant for Senator. If you
insist on doing so against my or
ders I will consider you my enemy
kjad.-'will punish you.*'
Mr. Gage did not talk this way dur
ing the campaign. Then he said that if
'â¢â¢â iple would elect him he would
ler himself the servant of the peD
â¢jple and would serve their interests as
.they should dictate. At the same time
, Dple elected Mr. Gage they elected
tne-n to come to Sacramento to makw
laws for them and to elect a United
- Senator. These men are also the
servants of the people, but Governot
does not so consider them. He
apparently believes they are his serv
ants. This belief being firmly fixed in
his not overcrowded cranium he has
prdered them to carry out his own per
sonal wishes and not the wishes of the
people who elected them.
Such a condition of affairs might not
result in injury to the people's inter
ests were another man than Mr. Gage
in the Governor's chair, though the
affront would be as great. But Gover
nor Gage has, within the past two
weeks, proved himself to be the willing
tool of D. M. Burns and a gang of co.-
rupt politicians who are paid to carry
out the wishes of the Southern Pacific
Company and kindred corporations. He
carried out the wishes of Dan Burns
by fixing the date of his inauguration
for January 4, thus enabling him to
retain Mose Gunst, Burns' gambling
partner, in office as member of the San
Francisco Board of Police Commis
â¢rs.
as closlres to be elected United
a Senator and his desires are sec
onded by the Southern Pacific Com
on the authority of no less a per

political manager. Since his can
didacy was announced it has become
apparent that a majority of the mem
f the Legislature will refuse to

to insult the honor and intelligence of
legislators and to use the power that
the people have given him to prostitute
toe honesty of men and to further his
rwn private and selfish interests.
Evidence is at hand, and plenty of it
to prove that Governor Gage is using
patronage of his office and the

sition to assist th>- Senatorial candidacy

and as his conscience dictates.
THREATS CAUSE NO FEAR.
Assemblymen Will Not Be Driven
by Gage's Whip.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 6.â Governor Gage
has thrown down the gauntlet to the sup
porters of Grant's Senatorial candidacy
and it has been taken up. The new Gov
ernor has declared war on all who refuse
to assist in electing his friend. D. M.
Burns. United States Senator, and hos
tilities have followed close upon the heels
of the declaration. Xeither side will ask
or receive quarter.
The . situation, when viewed- from a
purely unprejudiced . standpoint, looks
promising for some exceedingly lively
times in the near future, and all because
the chief executive imagines the office to
which he has so lately succeeded* invests
him with the power of life and death over
his trembling subjects. At the very out
set of his reign he has started a rebellion
that bids fair to give non-combatants an
insight into the mental machinery of a
criminal lawyer turned politician.
Having declared that a vote for Grant
will be considered as a personal affront,
Governor Gage naturally expects instant
obedience or he will visit upon the luck-
less head of the disobedient the weight of
his majestic wrath. Before his election
Mr. Gage bore the reputation of being as
quiet as a lambâ several lambs, in factâ
but now that he is Governor of the State
he is terrible In his anger at all who
cross his mighty will. As a hoy he was
as other boys; as a youth be was not to
be distinguished from other youths; as
a stock raiser he achieved success and
momentary notoriety; as a lawyer he en
joyed the confidence and friendship of
associates; as a Governor of two days'
experience he has insulted the 120 mem
bers of the California Legislature vio
lated the moral obligations 'imposed' upon
him by his oath of office and the consti
tution of the State, and has publicly al
lied himself with the agents of the great
corporations that have had their hands
at the throat of the State for twenty
years.
But the members of the Legislature do
not propose to submit without a word of
protest. They propose to explain to the
Governor calmly but forcibly that he is
head of the executive branch of the Gov
ernment and that they compose the leg
islative branch. The two branches are
separate and distinct, and Governor Gage
has no more right, moral or dtherwlae, to
dictate or attempt to dictate to the Legis
lature than the Legislature has to dictate
his appointments or question his right and
power of veto or to grant pardons. It is to
be pointed out to him that his sole meth

ence legislative action is limited by con
stitutional provision to suggestion trans
mitted to the Legislature in the form of
messages. This sort of information will
probably be transmitted to the Governor
through speeches made on the floor of
one or both houses of the Legislature.
Many members are violently incensed
at the expressions of the Governor in
connection with the Senatorial situation,
and they declare a determination to give
expression to their opinion at an early
day. Some idea of what is being said
about the matter may be gained by a
perusal of brief interviews which are ap
pended. Assemblyman Melick of Orange
had this to say:
"I am not sorry that I supported Gage
for Governor, for I think he will give the
State a good administration, but I will
not allow him or anybody else to dictate
to me in that manner. His threat to usÂ©
tho power of his office to crush Grant' 3
supporter? will only have the effect of
strengthening their allegiance. Governor
Gage has said many hard things about
j Grant and made some onen charges. His
attack upon Grant in the Palace Hotel
was entirely unwarranted and reflected
little credit upon himself.
"As for his declaration that he will re
gard it as a personal affront for anybody
to vote for Grant, it is an outrage. I am
entitled to my opinions the same as Gov
ernor Gage or any other man is and no
threatening or bullying can make me
! change them. I intend to vote for Grant
! as long as he remains in the fight, and I
i do not think the Governor will dare to
: punish me for it. If he does, all well and
i good. I will not be the sufferer."
Assemblyman Charles B. Greenwell of
Ventura County was much incensed at
Governor Gage's unwarranted attempt to
influence the senatorial vote and concern
â¢ ing it had this to say: "It seems to me that
I it is nothing more or less than a bald at
! tempt at political intimidation, but it has
had no apparent effect. I have spoken dur
! ing the day to a number of my colleagues
: of the matter, but most of them had not
! even read the interview. I do not think
i that Mr. Gape's political play will have
! much if any effect."
Senator Mitt of San Diego was fully as
j strong in the expression of his opinion as
j was Assemblyman Greenwell, and. like
| him. he believed that Governor Gage's
I likes or dislikes would in no wise influence
i the Senatorial vote. "It was a most re-
I markable thing for the Governor of the
| State to say," said he. "I can scarcely
! believe that he said it. I have not heard
any great discussion of the matter during
the day and do not think that it has
made any great impression, surely not
! enough to influence probable results at
; all. As to my personal feeling, I cannot
i say that I have given it sufficient thought
I to have any feeling about it."
Assemblyman .-Â».rnerich of Santa Clara
I said that Gage's first specimen of Burns
politics had evidently not created any per
ceptible stir. He had heard none of his
! fellow- Assemblymen speak of it. and had
i not himself read the interview nor heard
of It until told of it by a representative
of The Call.
"I guess." said he. "that nothing of that
sort will make any difference in the pres
ent fight, and I really cannot say what
I think of it. as I have not read what the
Governor had to say. It Is rather a re
markable statement for the Governor to
make just at this period in the Senatorial
fight, but I guess it will make no differ
ence."
WHY SENATOR SMITH DID
NOT GET CHAIRMANSHIP
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â State Senator S. C.
Smith of Bakersfield has paid the first
installment of the price demanded by
Governor Henry T. Gage for his alle
giance to Grant.
Lieutenant Governor Neff announced
the list of standing committees of the
Senate this morning and when Secretary
Brandon read the name of General Dick
inson as chairman of the Finance Com
mittee Senator Smith fervently remarked:
"Turned down by the grace of God and
Gage."
Senator Smith has been given every
assurance long ago that he was to
have the chairmanship of the Finance
Committee and it had been published
broadcast throughout the State. Later in
the day, however, an emissary from the
Governor hunted up Smith and asked him
to call upon Gage, saying it was the lat
ter's request. After that Smith had less
to say about his "turning down," and at
the conclusion of the interview he de
clined to discuss the matter at all, say
ing- he did not care to embarrass the Gov
ernor in any way; that he had been
"turned down" and that was all there
was to It; by whom he did not know.
He did say, though, that a month or
more ago he received a letter from a
friend who is a close friend of Gage, in
which the writer stated authoritatively
that Smith was to have the chairmanship
of the Finance Committee and that it was
Gage's desire to have a certain gentleman
appointed chief clerk of the committee
because of his familiarity with the details.
Smith replied that he would be happy to
make the appointment, and the matter
was settled until last Wednesday, when a
friend of Smith learned that Senator
Dickinson was to have the chairmanship.
After adjournment to-day, and before
Smith had called on Gage at the latter's
request, the Senator went to Lieutenant
Governor Neff and asked why he had not
been made chairman of the Finance Com
mittee, as he had been assured he would
be. Mr. Neff explained that he intended
to give Smith the place, as the matter had
all been arranged, but that influences he
could not Ignore had demanded Smith's
turning down and Dickinson's substitution.
Mr. Neff did not state to Smith what
these Influences were, but that- Gage,
Burns and Frank McLaughlin caused the
substitution there can be no possible
doubt.
Although Smith would not discuss the
details of his interview with Gage, he
admitted that the chairmanship of the
Finance Committee was touched on, and
when pressed to state what explanation
Gage gave of his action he refused point
blank to say. But although he takes his
disciplining philosophically, Senator Smith
has no intention of yielding to Gage's de
mand that he desert Grant. On the con
trary, he is more open In his fealty to the
San Diegan than ever.
GENERAL BARNES MAKES
A CLEAN CAMPAIGN
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 6 âSenator H. V. More
house is an exceedingly wrathy man to
day. The Examiner this morning stated
that Senator Morehouse was to nominate
Dan Burns for Senator, thus Implying
that he had pone into the Mexican's camp.
Senator Morehouse requests The Call to
ttate in his behalf that he is not a hench
man of Burns; that he never has been and
never will be.
Senator Morehouse will have the honor
of presenting the name of General \v. H.
L. Barnes before the Senate for United
States Senator, acting in accordance with
the expressed wish of an overwhelming
majority of his constituents, as well as
his own desires. Moreover, he will vote
for the general to the last ballot.
Barnes is exceedingly fortunate In the
selection of men who will sneak in his
behalf in both houses, for Morehouse Is
I one of the best orators In the upper
! house, while Luchslnger of Solano, who
; will make the seconding speech, is an
| other gifted speaker.
In the Assembly Lardner of Placer will
i place the general in nomination, while
: Judge Clough of Plumas will second him.
\ Barnes' managers are preparing to bring
their "push" up to Sacramento, and by
: Sunday night there will be a large force
ion hand to boom the general. But they
: will be as different from the Burns push
jas day is from night. Theodore Reichert
I has received a letter from J. B. Stetson
i stating that it will give him great pleas
; ure to come up and do what he can for
! his old friend, while M. H. Hecht has tele
\ graphed that he will also come. And there
i are othersâ men of the highest standing
i throughout the State. Their method of
"doing" politics will be vastly different
from that pursued by Dan Burns and his
heelers, and it will be interesting to note
which will prove the most effective.
THERE WAS NO DEAL
IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 6.â The man whom Gover
nor Gage believes consummated the al
leged trade in San Diego County whereby
he thinks the Republican State ticket lost
votes in that county and the Republican-
Grant legislative ticket gained votes is
Charles Hardy, one of the Republican
leaders of the county. Mr. Hardy is now
in Sacramento helping out the Grant
fight.
The charge is made that Mr. Hardy
made an arrangement with J. Harvey Me-
Carthy, editor of the San Diego VidetU,
the Democratic organ, whereby the Dem
ocrats in San Diego County were to sup
port the Republican legislative ticket in
the interest of Grant's Senatorial candi
dacy, in return for which Hardy and such
Republicans as he could influence were to
vote for Maguire for Governor.
Mr. Hardy most emphatically denies
that he over made any deal with Mc-
Carthy of any kind or with any other
Democrat. He cites the fact that Gage
carried San Diego County by 271 major
its-; that two Democratic Supervisors
were elected in the county, as well as a
Democratic County Clerk by 1200 major
ity. He claims that Gage received as
large a vote in San Diego County pro
portionately as he did in any other county
tn the State. He also adds that there
was no necessity for any trading to elect
the Republican legislative ticket in San
San Diego, as both Assembly districts
and the Senatorial district were safely

WRIGHT MAKES AN
ADMISSION THAT
IS SIGNIFICANT
Attempt Was Made to Tamper With
the Vote of Morris Brooke.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â The bold atteript on
the part of railroad agents to bribe and
intimidate Assemblyman Morris Brooke
created surprise in the Legislature. The
Call's exposure of the scheme came at
the proper time. The members were
prepared to hear that base influences
were employed to advance th> political
fortunes of Dan Burns, but they did not
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
imagine that threats to unseat a mem
ber would follow the failure of efforts
to bribe him. All day long the touts
hay been working to break the force
of The Call's disclosures, but their en
deavors in this direction bring out con
firmatory facts.
Colonel J. B. Wright, division super
intendent of the railroad, saiu in an in
terview to-day: 'About one month ago
a prominent merchant of this city came
to me in the interest of Morris Brooke,
saying that if I would interest myself
in Brooke's behalf, his (Brooke's) vote
could be controlled for United States
Senator. I said at once that I had no
choice at that time for Senator, and,
furthermore, that I did not believe
Brooke's vote could be controlled in
that way. Then I dismissed the matter
and never heard any more about
Brooke until a few days ago, when the
same merchant called me up by tele
phone to assure me that 'That vote is
all right.' I said that it made no dif
ference to me."
The confession that a prominent
merchant was engaged in fixing the
vote of Assemblyman Brooke is sig
nificant. The telephone message to the
effect that the vote was all right surely
intended to convey to Mr. Wright the
knowledge that the vote was all right
for somebody known to the receiver as
well as to the sender of the brie? mes
sage. There is not the slightest doubt
in the world that the sender of the
message in telephoning to Mr. Wright
meant to convey the glad news that
the vote was all right for Dan Burns.
The '"prominent merchant" is doubtless
the man who had the two interviews
with Assemblyman Brooke at the Gol
den Eagle Hotel. In the first interview
the proposition was made to Brooke
that the contest would be dismissed if
he would pledge himself to vote for
some candidate to be named at a future
time. The Assemblyman did not take
kindly to the suggestion of promising
to vote for an unknown and therefore
withheld his reply. When the secona
interview took place the '"prominent
merchant" mentioned the name of Dan
Burns as the candidate whose identity
had been concealed at the first meet
ing. At the second interview the prom
ise of reward to support Burns was
coupled with the threat that the As
semblyman would be unseated if he
did not get into line for Burns.
This circumstance corroborates The
Call's original story that Brooke was in
a distressing position and hesitated to
give a straight answer. The presump
tion is clear that the "prominent mer
chant" construed the hesitation upon
the part of the Assemblyman as a sure
indication that the coveted vote for
Burns had been obtained. The message
was, therefore, telephoned to Colonel
Wright: "That vote is all right."
There are some hidden facts in the
story of attempted bribery and intimi
dation. If The Call had the authority
vested In the Assembly to administer
! oaths, summon witnesses and coniDel
j the production of papers, it would very
soon ascertain the name of the "oromi
nent merchant" who promised to re
ward Assemblyman Brooke, provided
the Assemblyman would vote for Dan
Burns, and then threatened that if
Brooke did not line up for Burns. Wil
liam Johnston would be seated in the
Assembly to represented the Twenty
second District. This is a good time to
expose by name the paid agents ot tha
railroad who offer bribes and utter
threats to influence the votes of mem
bers of the Legislature.
The Assembly has the power to com
pel witnesses to attend and answer
questions.
The "prominent merchant" who of
fered Mr. Brooke a four years' position,
in the County Clerk's office of Sacra
mento, asserting that William B. Ham
ilton had promised a place to J. B.
Wright, had no authority for maklnj?
such an offer. He offered goods that
|he knew he could not deliver. County
â¢ Clerk Hamilton asserts no promise of a
position was made to Colonel Wright,
but on the contrary a position was re
served for Assemblyman Brooke, who
was on the People's ticket along with
I the County Clerk. The Call's Imresti
; gation of the facts in the case shows
i that Mr. Hamilton was in no sense
j connected with the negotiations. Cer
tainly Colonel Wright had no claims
for recognition, as hie opposed the elec
tion of Hamilton.
GLOOM IN THE GRANT CAMP,
The Call's Exposure of the Clough
Scandal Creates Con-
sternation,
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
mento, Jan. 6.â The Grant managers are
sullen and silent in the gloom of their
headquarters. A cloud of scandal hanpa
over their camp. Dan T. Cole"s blundering
attempt to bribe the honest and noble
Judge Clough of Plumas is the talk of the
lobby. It was a sorry day for %rrant when
Cole" left his nice fat berth in the Mint
to do a little practical politics for the San,
Diego statesman.
Milt Green and Jim Brown ascertained
last night that The Call had the trua
story of Cole's letter to Judge Clough,
! and so, to break the force of the dlsclos
| ure, decided to do something to Justify
! the publication of a contradictory state
ment. They reasoned that the trouble
was caused by Cole sending one letter,
and as a remedy decided that be should2
Bend another. He was cautioned, how
eyer, against writing to Judge Clough,
bo General Barnes, whose apartments
were hanÂ«ly, was singled out as a shining
merk for the. read\ letter carrier. Milt
< ;.r> . n and Jim Brown probably wrote the
letter, but made no apologies for haste
find a bad pen. Perhaps General Barnes
v.as addrei iuse the eloquence of
th>- orator was once Invoked to send the
San Diego statesman to the Republican
National Convention as a delegate at
largo, and therefore the general was en
t';lcd to receive the announcement that
â¢the Btatesman from th>- smith was flying
a-.Pignftl of distress. This time the gen
eral did not g'i to the rescue, but simply
exclaimed, with the warmth with which
the rccusion justiiied. "To with Dan
Colo."
Under tfu circumstances, the writing of
the k-tie: Lo Barnes was a grievous mis
fako upon the part of Grant's managers.
It removed the last vestige of doubt that
< '"1 liar" written a letter to Judge Clough,
v.i, in in ;,i, offer was made to pay the
Judge's campaign expenses up to the sum
of $50u if he (( lough) would sign a pledge
to vote for (irant.
The effort of Mill Gieeq to convince the
people oi" California that Cole wrote the
letter on liis responsibility is appreciated
fop what it is woiih. but it is not worth
much. Dan Cole is utt spending his own
money In this fashion.
â The resort to letter writing in dealing
with Judge Clough can be easily ex
plained by known conditions. Quincy, in
Plumas County, where th^ Judge lives.
Is quite a distance from San Francis. o,
and therefore could not be easily reached
by the Grant managers in peAon. There
on old friend was tingled out to com
municate with the Assemblyman from
Plumas. When Dan Cole's full and iree
confession is placed before the public this
surmise will he established as a fact.
Bribery, like murder, will out. Men who
barter in votes Burely come to grief in
tin long run and to ease a troubled con
s. i' nee tell the truth. If the facts
are not brought out in a leg^lative inves
tigation- they may be brought forth in a
Congressional inquiry. In the face of
fat ts known to leading men of California
it is doubtful if Grant could hold a seat
in the United States Senate. Caldwell of
Kansas was forced to resign in order to
avoid expulsion, and the evidence against
his hri nts was no worse than could be
produced against the Grant managers.
The Legislature now in session may de
cline to investigate the scandal connected
with the campaign to secure votes for
Grant, bul U sure as fate the next Legis
lature will take up the subject and get
the bottom facts.
The followers of Burns and the agents
of Grant feel bitterly toward each other,
and the feeling of bitterness increases as
the contest prepresses. Each side say 9
hard things of the other. In the burns
camp there is talk of sending some one
to the penitentiary. The terrible secret
of Senatorial infamy held in reserve by
Burns may be sprung when the joint con
vention proceeds to ballot for Senator.
The statement from Governor Gage that
he would regard a vote cast for Grant as
a personal affront has made the Grant
men more determined than ever, yet there
is gloom in their camp resulting trom

ation, according to the judgment of weil-
Informed members of the Legislature, wal

A GENERAL KICK WAS MADE.
Assemblymen Protested at Every-
thing From the Weather to
Waste Baskets.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
-ICENTO, Jan. 6.â Grove L. Johnson's As
sembly bill No. 1, providing $50,000 for the
use of the State Printing Office, came
back to the Assembly this morning, after
having been passed by the Senate, and
was sent to be enrolled, engrossed, print
ed anu handed to the Governor for his
signature.
It was praetioaly a stand up and roll
call session this morning, as It will be to
morrow. The little business that was on
hand was pushed through or delayed till
later in the month as rapidly as could be,
but. though the time was short, the legis
lators had time to kick, and a general
kick it was. The members froae through
the rollcall and shivered through the
prayer of the chaplain, but they objected
to the general frost when the usual order
of business came on.
Mead of Los Angeles arose to a ques
tion of information and wanted to know
why it was the Secretary of State did not
attend to the proper heating of the cham
ber, as was his duty.
Speaker Wright said he thought the
question timely, but said he had already
had his attention called to the matter by
chattering statesmen and had called upon
the proper officials to have the chill dis
pi reed.- He thought it would be com
fortably warm by Tuesday morning.
Melick of Los Angeles had a kick com
ing, too. It was a reiteration of one that
he introduced earlier in the session, and
was decidedly pertinent. He put it in
the form of a resolution, that was adopt
ed, directing the sergeant at arms to ttn-d
out what had become of the wastepaper
baskets, extra desks and chairs bought
at the last session for the use of the As
sembly. He wanted to know where they
had gone, "if the sergeant at arms could
find out," so that the use of them might
be had at the present session.
There was a general kick on the official
stenographers as well. Since they got
their jobs, none of the shorthand people
have turned up around the building, and
a number of the San Francisco delegation
got up to ask what had become of them.
Speaker Wright said he had seen none of
them, and he instructed them from the
chair that hereafter they would be re
quired to report each morning to the chief
clerk and be ready to do whatever busi
ness was on hand.
Senator Cutter's anti-wine resolution,
affecting the inaugural ball, came back
to the Assembly from the Benate attached
to Assembly concurrent resolution 3, and
it was passed in Just fifty seconds and
without debate.
The report of the Committee on Mile
age came up for adoption and gave rise to
considerable debate. It allowed each mem
ber 10 cents a mile for every mile he had
traveled in getting to the capital and 10
cents a mile back again. Some claimed
their accounts short, others that they had
been awarded too much. Grove Johnson
gave vent to 20 cents" worth of virtue by
moving as an amendment to the report
that the 20 cents allowed him for traveling
from his office at Third and X streets to
the Assembly chamber be stricken out on
the ground that he aid not consider its
allowance constitutional.
Assemblyman Knight of Sacramento did
the same thing, and after a half-dozen
other petty amendments the report was
adopted.
Burnett of San Luis Oblspo proved that
he was here for the benefit of his con
stituents by Introducing a joint resolution
directing Congress to do everything it
honorably could to effect the building of
the breakwater at Port San Luis. His res
olution, which was referred to the Com
mittee on Federal Relations, was as fol
lows:
Whereas, the growing Importance of the com
merce of the Pacific Coast demands the de
velopment of our various harbors; therefore,
be it
Resolved, By the Assembly, the Senate con
curring, that our Senators and Representatives
in ConxreHS be requested to use all honorable
means to secure a sufficient appropriation to
complete the Port San Luis breakwater with
out further delay.
Resolved, Further, that the chief clerk of
the Assembly be instructed to transmit by mall
a copy of these resolutions to each of our Sen
ators and Representatives in Congress.
Henry of San Francisco introduced a
resolution, which was adopted, providing
for the purchase of eighty-five copies of
the pocket edition of the Codes of Cali
fornia for distribution among the mem
bers. It was followed by one from Valen
tine of Lob Angeles authorizing the Con
troller to draw a warrant for $255 in pay
ment for eighty-five copies of Henning's
Constitution of the State, which have al
ready been delivered.
Belshaw's concurrent resolution Indors
ing the policy of President McKlnley
cume back from the Benate with a substi
tute in the shape of Senate joint resolu
tion No. 2. A mistake was found in the
title of the resolution and It was sent back
to thÂ« Senate for correction.
Dibble brought matters to a close by
declaring that there was not enough busi
ness on hand to warrant further work,
and moved an adjournment to 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning. He said there would
be nothing to be done then but the an
nouncement of committees and the roll
call and that he would again move for ad-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1899.
Journment and until Tuesday morning at
10 o'clock.
STANDING COMMITTEES
OF THE ASSEMBLY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â Speaker Wright will an
nounce the standing committees of the
Assembly as soon as that body convenes
to-morrow morning, and he is glad it is
all over. The building of those commit
tees has been a month's hard work. Twice
he has had his list practically completed
and each time found some one or other
who was not satisfied with his allotment
and the whole thing had to be torn to
pieces again to sandwich him in. As a
result of it all, though, Speaker Wright
has what he considers the best list of
standing committees ever appointed in the
Assembly. In his opinion there are more
able men on the floor this year than in
any year of legislative history and he as
signs this fact to the high standard set
by the country districts at the recent
election and the assistance given him in
his selection by Speaker pro tern. Alden
Anderson. *
The Judiciary Committee this year
was cut to fit the cloth. There are just
twenty lawyers on the floor, and nineteen
of them were assigned to the committee.
All twenty would have been obliged to do
duty, but Mead of Los Angeles begged off,
on the ground that he wanted other work.
Grove L. Johnson was made its chairman,
find his work will be no light matter, as
the Committee on Constitutional Amend
ments and that on Crimes and Penalties
have been consolidated with the judiciary,
and the combination is a difficult one to
deal with.
The committees on engrossment and en
rollment have been combined, and that on
codes and statutes eliminated, as its work
is now being done by the Code Commis
sion. Belshaw of Contra Costa is down
as chairman of the Election Laws Com
mittee, and proposes to have the general
election law perfected before he goes out
of office.
The chairmanship of the Committee on
Ways and Means went to the Los An
geles delegation, and Assemblyman Val
entine got the appointment. Mr. Valen
tino has been of inestimable assistance- to
Speaker Wright since he took up his new
duties, and his reward is the most im
portant committee of the lower houÂ«o.
Dibble of San Francisco made a hard
fight for the chairmanship of the Com
mttee on Rules, and got it. What Mr.
lÂ»il>hle will do with it remains to be seen.

BURNS TRYING HARD
TO CONTROL DEMOCRATS
TALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â There is one force in the
California Legislature that Burns people
fear mightily, and that Is the thirty-five
votes the Democrats and Populists have
on Joint ballot.
As proof positive that the claims made
by the managers of Mexican Dan's can
vass that their man will be elected on the
first ballot are absolutely false and witn
out foundation, It is only necessary to
recite the fact that the handlers of Col
onel Burns' fight are showing a phenom
enal interest in keeping the Democrats
in line for a Democratic Senatorial candi
date to the close of the fight.
If Colonel Burns had the requisite num
ber of votes to secure his election on the
first ballot or on a few subsequent bal
lots, neither he nor his friends would care
whether the Democratic members voted
for a Republican or for a Democrat for
United States Senator. It would be to
them a matter of perfect indifference. But
the colonel is far short of the requisite
votes to win, and his managers are well
aware of the fact. This being the case
they anticipate a lone drawn out fight,
and the possibility or the Democratic
members, or some of them, stepping in
at a timely moment and breaking a deau
lock.
The Burns people also realize the fact
that if even Democratic Assemblymen
and Senators do enter the contest to vote
for a Republican for United States Sena
tor that Republican will not be Daniel M.
Burns.
So a resolution was introduced in the
Democratic joint caucus which if adopted
would have had the effect of tying the
Democratic legislators into voting for a
Democratic Senator to the end of the
fight.
The resolution was promptly consigned
to oblivion, being tabled by the decisive
vote of 18 to 8. without even being ac
corded discussion The sentiment of the
caucus was practically unanimous.
Only on two ballots are the Democratic
members of the Legislature compelled by
the mandate of their caucus to vote for
a Democrat. On the first ballot they are
to vote for Senator Stephen M. White,
and on the second ballot for James D.
Phelan.
After that, unless some change in pres
ent plans is made, the Democrats will be
able to act as a free and independent
force in the Senatorial contest, and some
of them will undoubtedly exercise their
freedom.
Assemblyman Fairweather of Fresno
County is one of those Democrats who
take a very bold position in the Senatorial
contest. Mr. Fairweather states that
while he was elected as a Democrat, he is
in the California Legislature as a repre
sentative of the people, and after having
done his party duty he will, if he Rees flt,
exercise his right to vote for a Republican
for Senator If by so doing he can save the
good name of the State.
There are other Democrats who are
equally as Independent rs Assemblyman
Fairweather. Assemblyman Meserve of
San Bernardino County and Assemblyman
Mead of Los Angeles County will, so it 13
claimed, take the same position that the
courageous Assemblyman from Fresno
County does.
What the Burns people fear Is that In
the event there should be a sharp contest
for a number of days and that Grant
should make a showing of strength which
would bring him In sight of the coveted
prize there might be a stampede of Demo
crats to his column which would sweep
him In.
It Is stated on excellent authority that
already five Democratic legislators have
ledfred themselves to vote for Grant In
the event the contest proves a long one.
This If the nucleus of the Democratic
stampede which the Burns managers fear.
Milton Green, Grant's manager, does not
deny that Grant may receive Democratic
votes, but he does say that the first prop
osition they are trying to work out is to
elect Mr. Grant by Republican votes. It
Is claimed that the Burns people do not
desire a caucus at first, but if after the
balloting has continued for several dayÃ
no result is reached, they propose to force
a caucus before thorp can be any Demo
cratic stampede to Grant.
The Grant forces received another addi
tion to-day in the way of a worker. Col
onel A. G. Gassen. member of the Repub
lican State Central Committee, arrived
fmm San Diego this evening, and Imme
diately launched himself into the fight for
the San Diego man.
JUDGE WAYMIRE A
CANDIDATE FOR SENATOR
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â Judge James A. Way
mlre, one of the foremost candidates for
Senatorial honors at the last sesÃlon of
the Legislature, arrived at the capita!
this evening and registered at the Golden
Eagle. In an Interview he said:
"I came over from Modesto, where I
have some irrigation Interests, intending
to return to my home in Alameda this
afternoon. My purpose in stopping over
was to meet old friends here and look over
the situation as to the Senatorship. I
have an ambition to be Senator, but have
not organized any contest. I shall not
spend any money and not much time. If
the contest should be prolonged and if I
could serve the party and the State by
helping to harmonize the elements as a
compromise candidate I would be only
too glad to do so.
"I believe I could be of service to the
State in Washington at this time. There
are very important questions pending and
likely to come up in relation to the Nlca
raguan canal, the impro%'ement of our
harbors, the construction of reservoirs
for the irrigation of our arid lands, our
foreign policy and other important na
tional issues, to which I have given some
attention.
â¢'I have a great many friends in both
houses of the Legislature, who assure me
that they will Be glad to support me.
Many of them, however, are committed
to other candidates, who were earlier in
the contest. I cannot expect their sup
port until they have fulfilled their obliga
tions to others. I return home to-morrow
afternoon and expect to be here again
next week, prepared to stay a few days
and take the chances of the contest."
SENATOR BOGGS' BILL TO
LOAN MONEY TO THE STATE
CALL HEADQUARTEDS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â On Tuesday next Sena
tor Boggs of Colusa will introduce into
the T:nate the following bill providing
for the loaning of public moneys to reli
able banking institutions, and the crea
tion of State and county depositories for
public cash. Senator Boggs' bill follows
the line laid down in the report of ex-
State Treasurer Will S. Green. It is as
follows:
An act eÃtnblishlng a State and County
Hoard of Deposits; to define the duties thereof
and authorizing the establishment of deposi
tories of public moneys:
The people of the State of California, repre
sented In Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows:
Section 1. The Governor, the State Treasurer
an.l the Attorney General shall constitute a
State Board of Deposits, and the Board of Su
pervisors of each county in the State shall con
stitute a County Board of Deposits, and each
board shall have the powers and exercise the
duties hereinafter provided. The Govern' .r
?hall be the president of the State Board and
any clerk. In the office of the State Treasurer,
whore the records shall be kept, may be desig
nated as secretary.
Sec. 2. As soon as practicable after the
passage of this act the State Board shall make
and establish such rules, consistent with this
act, concerning State and county depositories
as it may deem expedient, which rules may
from time to time he amended. As often as
necessity require? the State Board shall ad
vertise in one paper in each city of 10,000 in
habitants for bids for the use of the State's
money. Bids must state the rate of Interest,
which must not be less than 2 per cent per
annum, proposed to be paid on daily balances,
and the class of bonds proposed to be deposited
as security for any funds that might be In
trusted to the bidder.
No money must be deposited In any State or
county depository unleps secured by the deposit
in the State Treasury of the United StateH.
State or thÂ« county of municipal bonds of this
State to the full face value of the deposit to be
made. The State Board must fix a percentage
of county and municipal Indebtedness on the
assessed value of the property, above
which the bonds of no county or municipality
must be taken as security by either State or
county; and whenever bonJs are impaired in
value, from any cause, the County Board, in
case of a county, and the State Hoard in any
case, must require additional deposits. In
making awards between bidders offering an
equal rate of interest the State Board shall
consider the widest distribution of the money
and the location of State institutions. Upon
the deposit of the bonds as above provided,
and when the rules of the board have been
complied with, the State Treasurer must make
the proper deposits and tne place of deposit
shall be known ac a State depository-
Sec. 3. Kach County Board shall advertise
as often as may be necessary, in at least one
newspaper in the county, for four weeks for
bids for the use of the money in the County
Treasury. Each bid must state the rate of In
terest that will be paid on daily balances,
which shall not be less than 2 per cent, and
the character of bonds proposed to be deposited
as security. The board In making the award
shall make as nearly as practicable an equal
distribution of the money among equal bid
ders, and shall also when practicable give
preference to those offering local bonds for de
posit. Upon notification by the State Treasurer
that the bonds have been deposited as awarded
the County Treasurer shall make the proper de
posit, and the place of deposit shall be known
as a county depository.
Bee. 4. The Controller and each County Audi
tor shall each draw warrants on the State or
County Treasurer, as at present, and the Treas
urer shall draw his check on the proper depos
itory, giving as far as practicable the option
to the payee. Both the State and County
Treasurer must keep in \-iew the equal distri
bution of the moneys drawn, and if it be
comes necessary to draw heavier on one than
another in proportion to the amounts depos
ited, the Treasurer, State or County, is au
thorized to draw his check on one depository
in favor of another.
Sec. 5. On the failure of any depository to
pay checks from the proper source, the board
under whose Jurisdiction the depository shall
be must at once proceed to settle up with the
depository, and if necessary may summarily
sell the deposited bonds; and if there shall
be any deficiency, may seize upon any prop
erty of the corporation, and If not sufficient
shall be found of corporate property, then, In
dividual property of stockholders must b<?
taken, aa provided by the Code of Civil Pro
cedure.
Sec. 6. The owners of any of the bonds de
posited as security under this act may deliver
the tax receipts for taxes paid upon such
bonds to the State Board of Deposits, and the
said receipts shall be accepted as so much
cash upon the payment of Interest from said
owners or depositors to the State and to the
county where such owners reside.
Sec. 7. The State Board shall cause to be
established between the several State and
county depositories a system of exchange by
which the cost of transportation of the public
moneys may be as far as practicable elim
inated.
Sec. 8. The State Treasurer shall Inquire
into the sufficiency of county deposits before
he notifies a County Treasurer of their re
ceipt, and If he hnve any doubts shall lay the
matter before the Treasurer, who may reject
the same or may require additional deposits.
Sec 9 Neither the State nor any County
Treasurer shall be liable on their official bonds
for losses occurring by default of any depos
itory.
Sec 10 AÂ«t soon as the terms of the present
incumbents expire the offices of County Treas
ury and County Tax Collector shall be con
solidated.

SOME QUEER THINGS
ABOUT ELECTION MONEY
Revelations of the Republican Central
Committee Report
Governor Gage's Opposition to Grant Is the
Sensation of the Day at the State
Capital.
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â When an individual
is interested in the welfare of a party,
for him to subscribe toward the meet
ing of its legitimate expenses is, of
course, proper. Campaigns cannot be
run on wind, although I am bound to
say they can't be run without wind
either. A glance at the report of the
Republican Central Committee is in
teresting. It shows total receipts $49,
--722 10 and expenditures of $49,649 39.
This ought to leave a little balance, but
it is understood the committee is in
i debt. However legitimate donations
| may be, some of them are peculiar
i when taken into consideration together
with the other side of the account. For
i instance smiling Billy Hamilton gave
1 $20, and was paid $50 on "speakers' ac
count." Where was the speech de
livered? If it was merely one of the or
dinary talks of the Federal push, pro
jected hatwise, the figure is too high,
leaving Hamilton $30 winner. Jake
i Shaen gave $37 50 on two different oc
casions, but he draws a Federal salary
while doing State politics and could af
ford to be generous. Dan Cole threw
$99 into the pot and drew out $360 for
"election expenses." Whose election is
not stated. Among the men paid for
making speeches Major Kyle heads the
list, but he made many speeches, and
good ones. But why should Long John
Wilkins appear on the same roll? John
is no orator.
Why should Tirey L. Ford have
charged $7 when one of the important
offices was his reward? These ques
tions are not asked captiously, but with
a desire for information. Nor is it
clear why Steppacher should have
drawn as salary $508 50. He should
have been content with hib Federal
salary, for which he performed no work
during the weeks the Republican Cen
tral Committee devoted to planning
the election of Dan Burns.
It is not surprising that the Pacific
and Sunset Telephone companies
should have chipped in $2000. It has
been doing things which a legislator
might be induced to characterize as
felonies. It has its workers here. too.
probably to be paid out of a separate
fund. George Crocker contributed $7500.
but far be it from me to intimate that
this was railroad money, for the rail
road had already declared itself not in
politics. Dan Burns himself gave 11,
--000 Candelarian dollars. The purity of
his motives will not be questioned, for
there is not any.
Altogether a stud- of thÂ« report Is an
instructive lesson in pocketbook pa
triotism. I forgot to say that Major
McLaughlin is down for $2500, which,
with the time he surrendered to boom
ing Burns, was exceedingly liberal.
Southern California seems not to
have added to the central committee
spending money. Nobody in Gage's
county of IS.OOO Republican voters save
Federal office holders responded to the
opportunity. Either the idea prevailed
that Gage was not worth it or that the
north would furnish the necessary
votes. I have noticed that, as a rule,
in California politics the north supplies
the money and votes, while the south
gets the offices.
Nobody is doing anything but specu
late as to the outcome of the Senato
rial fight. Into this tight no new ele
ments have been thrust. Knight has
gone home, but this does not change the
situation. Barnes is still here, his
friends around him, but those who are
not bound to him sneak of the Rosser
trial with the lack of defense, the piti
ful breakdown of the State's case a? a
poor sort of boost toward Senatorial
honors. I have not heard much of
Bulla's chances, and am inclined to
think they are dreams.
The sensation is the position of Gov
ernor Gage. Heart and soul he is for
Burns, and is under the thumb of that
eminent defaulter and statesman where
he wriggles in apparent content. I am
sorry to have been forced into the be
lief that Gage is the smallest man in
tellectually that ever sat in the execu
tive chair, and Waite has been Gover
no: of Colorado. If he had not been
chosen to carry out the purpose of
somebody else, he would never have
been chosen; but realizing this from
the moment of his nomination people
did not think he would devote the pow
ers of his place to insulting California
by attempting the elevation of Burns.
They may have regarded him as a boor,
but they could not realize him as a
willing tool.
Gage declares that the vote of any
man for Grant will be considered a per
sonal affront. Here is a pretty pfc*
ture. The Governor of a great State
using the authority of his office as a
club to hold over the heads of legis
lators, the chosen servant of the peo
ple dictating that they shall have upon
them the shame of a Burns in the Sen
i ate. The truth could have been better
.expressed this way: "Every vote cast
for Burns will be a personal affront to
; every citizen of California save the
I ragtag and bobtail of the political
i slums."
Gage has probably succeeded in do
: ing just the opposite of that which he
had intended to do. If Burns had any
, chance Gage, posing in the attitude of
I buliy and blusterer, has killed it. If
i Grant had a hard tight Gage has bat
tered down the barricades and cleared
; the path of the San Diegan. I do not
: suppose tlna Grant feels particularly
grateful, fur a gift is judged by the
; spirit of the giver. Nevertheless, in a
: stupid and blundering way, Gage has
i done more for him than was in the ex
ecutive power io do for Burns. This
! Legislature is not to be driven. It does
[ not fear Gage, and it is rapidly learning
not to respect him. Gage will get no
j more gulden eggs. He has slain the
Burns guutse. From the standpoint of
! politics tnere could not have been a
worse play. The goose needed killing,
but there was no obligation upon Gage
|to perform the slaughter. The act was
ungrateful and uncouth, an exhibition
lof shortsightedness and churlishness.
I Gage helps bring about the defeat ut
: Burns and yet is entitled to no credit.
| He is like the man who fires a gun at
: the enemy, but linds the weapon dan
\ gerous only at the breech and his own
j earthworks demolished.
It is a good thing that the inaugural
ball is to be on the prohibition plan.
, There are plenty of people here who
i arise in the morning with painful recol
| lections of the night before, and for the
I State to give them a free drunk would
i promote the intensity of remorse,- as
I well as subject more people to it. In
augural balls are at their best when
all the guests are sober, and a states
man picking his way thrc-ugh a maze
I of skirts and electric lights, beauty and
grace, at the same time carrying two
thirds of a jag, would be at a distinct
| disadvantage.
Many of the San Franciscans here
i appear perfectly at home. I learn that
i they are in Sacramento every session,
: either holding jubs or chasing one. If
' the job eludes them they chase some
body who was mere fortunate and ul
: timately induce some tender-hearted
i one to pay their fare back to the city.
They explain that they would willingly
walk, except that the walking is bad
! beyond Oakland. A p,art of the dis-
I appointed ones have already gone, but
j the remarks they made about the Bel
shaw law still poison the air.
The subject of bribery has been men
tioned. All the gentlemen I have asked
about it assure me they have not been
| bribed, and have not bribed anybody:
With Purist Burns in the race, of
course such methods of diplomacy
would be regarded with horror. It ia
a comfort to learn that bribery is here
| looked on as crime, particularly if
i found out.
Several people have intimated vari
ously that newspaper notoriety is not to
their taste. I can only regret that I
was not sent here with orders to cater
to their tastes. An excellent way in
which to avoid notoriety is to behave
oneself, and I suggest this to the plain
tiffs in the case.
This has been a very quiet day. Yes
terday there was music by the band,
but to-day chin music is the limit.
However, the patter of the rain makes
melody not to be despised.
Several prize-fighters have arrived. I
do not know what Senatorial boom they
represent, but there are no ring events
scheduled, they are not in training, nor
are they supposed to be in quest of
health. The picture of Mose Gunst
publicly showing his diamond-studded
shirt front made a great hit. Some of
the push looked at it longingly. "It'a
a wonder we let Mose get out of town
with them shiners," said one of them.
Colds are prevalent here, so when a
statesman is heard speaking In husky
whispers, there is no possibility of tell
ing whether or not he talked hims. If
into the condition.
SKAGUAY IS AGAIN
VISITED BY FLAMES
Destruction of the Theater Royal, the
Largest Variety Show in the

JUNEATT. Alaska, Jan. 2 (via Victoria,
Jan. ti>.â The Theater Royal, the largest
place of variety entertainment in Skag

000. Two buildings, one on each aide, were
razed by the Fire Department, ana the

Skaguay was very fortunate with this
fire. A heavy gale coming down the

AND WAS BETRAYED
The Governor Cried for Help and Now
Forgets His Promises,
The Executive Outlines a Scheme to Replace
Senator Perkins Four Years Hence by
the Grace of the Railroad.
r-ALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â Henry T. Gage, Gov
ernor of the State of California, prides
himself upon the fact that he is the
boul of political honor. Mr. Gage has
often asserted that he never forgets a
pledge made nor a promise piven. But
it would seem that in these latter days
Mr. Gage's memory is either failing him
i ! ili" political honor about which he
â  alked so much ia merely an air
ehip.
There was a time during the cam
paign of 1898 that the prospects for the
n of Mr. Gage were not brilliant.
Angeles County there was no
wild enthusiasm over the campaign of
Mr. Gage, in fact there was a great
d<-al of Republican apathy existing, and
ame necessary for something to
be done to bring prominent Republicans
into the tight in order to save Gage's
county from being placed in the
lire column.
itor Bulla had a number of stanch
friends in the Republican party in Los
Angeles County, and in the hour of his
saity Governor Gage, then plain
lKnry Gage, turned to these friends of
Xiulla for succor.
And he did not appeal in vain. The
friends of Bulla assured Mr. Gage that
they would go forth and aid him, and
they did so.
In return for this Mr. Gage agreed
that whoever the Los Angeles County
delegation in the Legislr.ture agreed
upon as Senator that man would be
his candidate, and he would, if elected
Governor, aid in bringing about the
tion of that man tv the Senator
fchip.
Mr. Gage even went further. He
. that if th<- man agreed upon was
not from Loa Angeles County or city,
it mattered pot to him; it would be
just the same as long as he came from
Southern California.
Then Mr. Gage went on to state that
elected -be failed to keep
ledge he could be visited at his
in the Capitol and he would be
willing to be upbraided.
Mr. tiage has certainly forgotten his
ad he has demonstrated the
fact that his loudly heralded and
milch advertised political honor is
purely a myth.
For days past all the power of the
administration has been used to
tea to the camp of the man
from Mexico. Not one single, solitary
move, ht's the Governor made to aid
the canvass of Senator Bulla, whose
friends in October and November last
Worked night and day to save Los An
â  .. <â¢ and to spare him the
humiliation of losing the county in
which tie had resided for thirty years.
In the halls and corridors of the Capi
tal, in the rooms of the Golden Eagle
the streets of Sacramento leg
islators who refused to be forced into
the Burns camp have been threatened
with the vengeance of the State admin
istration. The friends of Bulla here
cramento have borne up heroically
' this betrayal and have said
â¢:g. They do not now, but to-day
mblyman W. S. Mellick of Los An
;dlod upon Governor Gage for an
view. It was accorded him, and
nor, to a certain extent, un-
J osi â  : himself.
Mr. Mellick is the editor of the
Daily News, an influential
Stinted in the Republican strong
t Los Angeles County. He sup-
Gage loyally, individually and
through his paper, and was one of the
As of Senator Bulla to whom tho
.â mor gave assurance that he
!? iii. If elected, assist In electing the
thÂ» Los Angeles County dele
:i to the United States Senate. Mr.
Mr-Hick reminded the Governor of, his
rid Mr. Gage replied that while
;he could not assist in the election of
Senator Bulla, he would do nothing to
Injure him. He said that he did pro-
v,, do everything in his power to
â¢ -rtion of Mr. Grant, but
â  1 that he was assisting the Burns
'. f/Â»r< â 
â¢ The Governor was very frank to ad
' mit that hi? sympathies were with
l.'.urn? for various reasons. Among
. things the Governor's heart went

newspaper exposures to which he was
â¢ being subjected, and then, again, he
;â  felt very kindly disposed toward him.
h-- Baid, on account of his past ser
vlces to the Republican party of Cali
fornia. The Governor then proceeded
to Inform Assemblyman Mellick that It
lid 'â 'â¢â  'i" great misfortune to South
ern California even if the Senator chos-
Is year was not a resident of the
Bouthern end of the State. If the Sen
ihis year was elected from the
.north, four years from now a Senator
'â¢â I t.i succeed Senator
'â¢Georgo C. Perkins.
This renews and gives credence to the
.. ptory that has been heretofore printed
that a combination was made some
time back whereby the railroad com
. pany is to Bend Colonel P.urns to the
Lte thia year, and four years from
â  now to replace Senator Perkins with
tli" present Governor of the State.
â¢ When news of this statement, which
mor Gage had made, was carried
Is of Senator Perkins to
night they were up in arms and thoy
will r.ot be appeased. Governor Gam
has undoubtedly brought down upon
his head a very merry war by thus pre
â  dieting the defeat of Senator Perkins
four years hence .'md volunteering the
â  information that it will he no misfor
tune to Southern California to lose the
Senator this year and send Burns.
SENATOR BULLA'S FRIENDS
READY TO HELP HIM
!. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6. S< nator Bulla to-day re
ceived a telegram from a number of
friend.'-- In Los Angeles asking him if their
presence at the Capital City would assist
him to any material extent in his fight
and announcing their willingness to come
if. in his judgment, returns would war
rant tii" outlay.
Senator Bulla wired a response to the
â¢ that be would be very glad to have
as many of his friends as could afford the
expense to visit the Captal city, hut he
did not think that large throngs of peo
ple could influence votes in the Senato
rial fif-'ht at this- stage of the game. How
there will be â  delegation arrive
from Los Angeles Monday to aid in push-
Ing the claims of Hulla to the Benator
ship. Edwin A. Meserve, the chairman of
the last Republican County convention of
T.os Angeles, will arrive to-morrow as
advance guard.
The Bulla people held their caucus to
night and from reports which were made
they aje led to believe 1 that two more
votes were (secured for Bulia to-day on
the first ballot. If their original figures
were correct this would ?cive Bulla
eighteen votes on the first ballot.
One thing is pelf-evident, and that is
that the turn Senatorial affair* have tak
en and the disclosures that have been
miule concerning the entrance of Colonel
Mazuma into the contest have not in
jured whatever prospect Mr. Bulla had.
TWO HARBOR BILLS
TO BE CONSIDERED
CALL HKAPQTARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 6.â Bills will be presented
at this session of the Legislature affect

San Diego. Assemblyman Mead will pre
sent the Los Angeles harbor bill and As
semblyman Works that affecting the har
bor of San Diego.
John T. Gaffey of Los Angeles has been
here for a number of days preparing the
way for the Los Angeles harbor bill. The
bill, which Mr. Gaffey has turned over to
Mr. Mead, cedes Jurisdiction over the nar- |
bor of San Pedro to the State and pro- 1

vlde6 for the appointment of a harbor
commission, to consist of three members.
The commission is also to have a secreta
ry. The Commissioners are to receive a
salary of $2n per month each, and the sec
retary is to receive a salary of $100 per
month. All theexpenses of the commission
are to be paid out of the fees collected
by the regulations of the commission for
wharfage.
The bill as drawn by Mr. Gaffey con
tains certain provisions in regard to the
construction of wharfs and other im
provements. Before the Los Angeles
County delegation takes any action upon
the bill it will probably be sent to Los
Angeles for the consideration of the
Board of Trade, Chamber of Commerce
and Merchants' and Manufacturers' As
sociation of that city.
The bill which Assemblyman Works will
Introduce in relation to San Diego bar
bor simply amends certain provisions of
the present law in regard to franchises
in San Di^go Hay. Among other things
it provides that before expirinc fran
chises can bo renewed the parties secur
ing renewals must obligate themselves
to reconstruct existing wharfs according
to the last scientific methods. The bill
of Assemblyman Works is merely amend
atory and not a new law.

Endurance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Jan. 6.â Robert
Parker, a prospector who lives in Sap
perton, fifty miles from this city,
passed through a terrible experience
three weeks ago which lias left him a
physical wreck for life. He was
brought here to-day to receive medical
attention. His right leg is broken in
three places, and both wrists are com
pletely shattered. In this condition he
crawled from Mount Baker to near his
home, a distance of fifty miles. It took
him nineteen days to complete the trip.
Parker was with his partner pros
pecting near the summit of Mount
Baker, where recent rich quartz finds
have been made. After making loca- |
tions and securing specimens of quartz, |
they descended the mountain. In pass- j
ing a glacier, Parker missed his foot- j
ing and was hurled down a crevice a
distance of fifty feet. His pack on his
back saved his life. With the help of
a long rope he carried his partner,
Charlie Bates, after great difficulty,
rescued Parker. The latter was un
conscious all that night, but the next
day, notwithstanding his terrible in
juries, he pluckily attempted to come
out to civilization with his companion.
Bates bound up his leg nnd wrists in
a rude way, and by alternately hop
ping and crawling Parker managed to
make a few miles.
Bates left him to seek help, leaving !
provisions. When he returned two
days later Parker had disappeared. He
did not turn up until two days ago,
when he was Riven up for lost. After |
Bates left him he crawled off the trail,
rarrying enough provisions to keep him )
several days. For six days he lived in 'â 
a deserted Indian hut, suffering ex- ;
oruciating pain. Starting out then he I
actually hopped and crawled a distance !
of twenty-five miles to a small settle- â 
ment, making ahout two miles a day.
There he was found by Bates and
brought to this city. Parker's leg Is j
twisted and misshapen, and he will
never use it again. Medical skill can j
do little with his wrists. From a robust
man of 225 pounds he has faded to a j
mere skeleton of IRO. His experience !
is considered the most remarkable In
the history of mining in this province.

BY CANNIBALS
Fate of the Crew of the
Sea Ghost.
SLAIN BY SOLOMON NATIVES
WHILE TBADING THE SAILORS
WERE OVERPOWERED.
All Killed and Eaten but Two, Who
Escaped After the Savages Had
Become Stupid From
Liquor.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 6.â Mail ad
vices from the South Pacific Islands via
Japan give details of the scuttling of
the schooner Sea Ghost by Solomon Is
land cannibals last October. The can
nibals killed the crew of the schooner
with the exception of two, who had a
remarkable escape. The Sea Ghost was
owned by her master, Captain Kohl
sohn. He sailed from Queensland with
a crew of ten men late in September
for Buka, an island of the German Sol
omon group, to procure a cargo of
copra.
A brief dispatch several weeks ago
stated that the Sea Ghost's crew had
been killed, but their exact fate re
mained a mystery until the two sur
vivors reached the Australian coast re
cently. Their story of the capture and
killing of their comrades is as follows:
Captain Kohlsohn arrived at Buka at
night. The next morning five or six
native boats came alongside, and in a
fiÂ»w moments the vessel's mats and
crew were talking and making friend
ly signs to the islandera. Several mem
bers of the crew went below to secure
goods for trading purposes, when
thirty natives suddenly jumped on deck
and attacked the sailors remaining
above the deck with knives. The latter
fought furiously for their lives, but
were overpowered.
Several more boatloads of armed na
tives arrived and fell upon the sailors
who had gone below, killing all but
three. One man jumped overboard,
swam ashore and was taken prisoner.
His two surviving comrades were
bound hand and foot. Captain Kohl- '
sohn was dragged from his cabin and
run through with spears. The natives j
then started ashore with their prison- |
ers, taking the dead sailors with them. |
Thfr two prisoners were left on the
sands, while the islanders prepared to
eat the bodies of their comrades. While
this grewsome feast was being made
ready several natives put out for tho
schooner and found n barrel of Hquor
In her cabin. In a short time the en
tire party bcofitno stupidly drunk.
The two sailors managed to escape
from the thongs which bound them
jumped in a boat and put to sea. After
floating helplessly about for two days
they were picked up by a trading yes- i
sel which carried them to other islands,
where they finally secured passage for
Australia.
Before proceeding to get Intoxicated
one party of natives unloaded a portion
of the Sea Ghost's cargo and then scut
tled her.
INSISTS ON INSTALLING
COLOMBET AS TREASURER
Mayor Martin of San Jose and His
Fight With the City
Council.
SAN JOSE, Jan. Â«.â The refusal of the
City Council to confirm Joseph P. Colom
bet for City Treasurer is leading to some
Interesting complications.
Mayor Martin summoned the Finance
Committee this afternoon and others In
terested and stated he desired to open
the Treasurers vault. City Clerk Cook
first objected. Deputy Treasurer Cottie
also refused to open two outside doors to
the vault, where the combination to the
vault may be found. He said his attor
ney had advised him not to do so until a
Treasurer had been connrmed and quali
fied. Colombo! was also present and
would probably have been installed as
Treasurer by the Mayor had the vault
been opened.
Mayor Martin has asked City Attorney
Beasiey for an opinion in regard to his
right to open the safe and will secure it
to-morrow. Until then nothing will be
done.
Mayor Martin still insists that he will
appoint no other than Colombet, who Is
well qualified, having filled the office be

VICTORY FOR THE

Is Adopted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â The anti
civil service reformers scored a victory
in the House to-day. The executive,
legislative and judicial appropriation
bill was taken up for consideration and
then, when the appropriation for the
civil service commission was reached,
Evans (R.) of Kentucky made a mo
tion to strike it out.
This motion has been made annually
for a dozen years or more, but invaria
bly failed. But to-day the opponents
of the law laid great stress on the fact
that they could not get a direct vote
upon the proposition and were there
fore compelled to seek its nullification
in this manner. Even these appeals
failed to bring out the full strength of
the opposition, though the motion to
strike out carried by a narrow margin
â67-61.
This was in committee of the whole,
where no record Is made of the vote.
Moody (R.) of Massachusetts gave no
tice that he would demand a record
vote In the House, where the friends of
the civil service law expect to reverse
the decision.

Hoar insisted that the Senate had as
much right to such information as the

FALSELY CLAIMED.
Brother of the Dead Woman Vindi

Secures Justice. ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Jan. 6.â A few days
ago it was stated in The Call that there
was a mystery surrounding the death
of Mary Moedinger in San Bernardino,
and that John Dempsey, who claimed
to be her husband, was an impostor.
It was also said that Fred Moedinger,
a brother, had been appointed special
administrator and had left for San Ber
nardino with a view of investigating
the matter. He returned last evening
and his mission was quite successful.
It will be remembered that the- body
of Miss Moedinger was shipped to this
city under the name of Mrs. Mary A.
Dempsey; that letters of inquiry to tho
Sheriff elicited the response that a man
named John Dempsey was holding per
sonal property of the deceased of the
value of several hundred dollars, under
a claim that she was his wife, and that
Dempsey neglected to answer all letters
of inquiry addressed to him.
"When young Moedinger arrived in San
Bernardino he consulted the District
Attorney and Sheriff. The three inter
viewed Dempsey, who at first made a
pretense that he knew nothing about
the personal property of the deceased.
When the Sheriff announced his inten
tion of making a search Dempsey
weakened and produced a package con
taining stock in the Woodland Build
ing and Loan Association valued at
$500, a note for $400 given by M. R.
York, and a lot of personal effects.
Dempsey admitted that he was an im
postor; that he and Miss Moedinger had
never been married, and that her char
acter was above reproach.
It appears that when she was taken
111 and her condition became alarming
she sent for Dempsey, because she had
known him in Yolo County. She gave
him two messages addressed to her
family In Woodland, v.ith a request
that he forward them, but both were
suppressed.
After death he took possession of her
property, claiming that they had been
married. Nobody in San Bernardino
interfered, as there was nobody there
who could dispute the claim. By ship
ping the body to Woodland he gave
young Moedinger the clew by which the
matter was investigated and the fraud
exposed.
Mr. Moedinger's first impulse was to
prosecute Dempsey, but second thought
influenced him to drop the matter on
account of the loss of time and the ex
pense involved. He is well pleased
with his success in recovering the prop
erty and vindicating the good name of
his sister.
AMERICA AND ENGLAND
ACTING IN CONCERT
The Two Governments Fully Under
stand Each Other in the Matter
of Affairs in China.
NEW YORK. Jan. 6. â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Minister Conger has notified the State
Department that the Chinese Government
has refused to accede to the French de
mand for an extension of French jurisdic
tion at Shanghai.
This action on the part of the Chines*
Government is the result of the protests
registered against compliance with
France's demand by the American
and British Governments. The au
thorities here have been quite
stirred up over the French de
mand for the reason that if it had been
granted a number of American citizens in
business in the foreign concessions at
Shanghai would have been transferred
to French jurisdiction.
The action of the British Government in
registering protests in this matter simul
taneously with the United States is re
garded as rather significant in some quar
ters and indicates an "entente cordiale,"
to quote an official with whom I talked,
existing between them, especially in ref
erence to Chinese affairs.
The report published from Shanghai
this morning 1 that a secret treaty existed
between the two governments" Is pro
nounced untrue, but there Is no question
that the governments fully understand
the position of each other with respect to
Chinese affairs.
One Office Abolished.

SOCIETY QUEEN
IN A PESTHOUSE
Mrs. Kurtz, One of the Handsomest
Women in Southern California,
Has Smallpox.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6. â One of the handsomest women in South
ern California has for more than two weeks been confined In the pest
house, a victim of the dreaded smallpox. The woman is Mrs. Carl
Kurtz, the wife of one of the leading physicians. Ysidore B. Scott,
the patient, was before her marriage to Dr. Kurtz one of the lead
ers of society. Three years ago she was the belle of the particularly
exclusive set of Northern society people who passed the summer at
Santa Monica.
Mrs. Kurtz !s the niece of Mrs. Arcadia B. de Baker, owner of the
Baker block, who is one of the wealthiest Spanish- American residents
south of Tehachapi. In i 097, when Miss Francisca Alexander, the
chosen fiesta queen, was seeking maids for her court, Mrs. Carl
Kurtz, owing to her peculiar type of Spanish beauty, was one of the
first to be selected as a maid of honor. About a year ago she mar
ried Dr. Kurtz, the son of Dr. Joseph Kurtz, one of the oldest prac
titioners in the State. Since their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Kurtz
have lived in the Baker block, in the heart of the city, where Mrs.
Baker also makes her home, this being the most aristocratic apart
ment house in the city. More than a fortnight since Mrs. Kurtz
became sick. Her husband pronounced her illness as a mild case of
varioloid. The health officers were notified, and a little later the so
ciety queen was removed to the isolated cabin which serves as a
pesthouse at the base of the foothills in a canyon near Elysian Park.
Careful nursing and constant attendance on the part of her husband
has brought Mrs. Kurtz out of danger, and to-day she is convales
cent.
FLOURISHED A
REVOLVER IN
THE PALACE
Demand for Money on
Tom Woodford.
A BLUFF SPEEDILY CALLED
THE GUN-FIGHTER'S IDENTITY
NOT KNOWN.
He Said He Was "Broke* and That
Woodford Would Have to PuÂ».
Up or There Would Be
Trouble.
"T'm hard pressed for money, TVoodford.
Tou swindled me out of $1500 in New Tork
and now you dig up. Cough up a $100 in
two minutes or I'll blow the top of your
head off."
The speaker was a rather short man, '
armed with an ugly looking revolver.
The threat was hurled at Tom Woodford,
the well known bookmaker, as he leaned
against the. railing in the rotuda of the
Palace Hotel last evening about 7:30
o'clock.
The short man. whose identity is a
mystery, was laboring under intense ex
citement. Woodford looked down into the |
muzzle of the revolver carelessly, but he
did not yield up the cash.
"You are crazy, and you'd better put
that revolver in your pocket. It might
gr> off," said Woodford calmly.
The bluff had been called, and, as Patsy j
Carroll would say, the short man was ]
not there with the goods." He put the
ugly looking weapon back in the outside
porket of his overcoat and then began to
abuse and threaten the bookmaker.
There was quite a crowd of horsemen in
the rotunda of the hotel at the time, but j
few of them noticed the affair, so quickly i
did it- happen. After quarreling for a few
minutes, tin- short man pulled the revol
ver again and said: "Woodford, I'm not
crazy; I may be drinking a little, at that, |
but I'm hard pressed, and you've got to
give up."
The argument was waxing warmer and
warmer every minute, and the onlookers
expected to see the short man carry out
his threat. Finally he cooled down, hur
ried out of the hotel and left Bookmaker
Woodford leaning calmly against the
railing in the same position as when so
violently accosted. Woodford did not
reem to take any notice of the danger,
as he followed the man out into the bar, I
whore the conversation was resumed.
As soon as he saw that his blufC had
failed the man with the revolver said
he would let the matter rest for the pres
ent, but he vowed that he would kill an
other gambling man who, he said, had
also robbed him.
W^odford refused absolutely to furnish
his assailant's name or even give a clew
to his identity. Many racing men who
â witnessed the affair were closely ques
tioned, but none of them scorned to know
â who the man was. They were satisfied
that the mysterious individual was a
member of the rarinc fraternity which
infests this city during the racing sea
eon.
When questioned last night. Mr. Wood
ford at first denied the story. Then, after
much parleying, the bookmaker admitted
that he did have "a rather exciting even
ing." but he refused absolutely to di
the identity <,f the man who threatened
to take his life.
"He is a good friend of mine, and was
excited when he accosted me this evening,
else he would neVer have acted as he did.
The charges that he made were groundless,
end when we went into the bar later to
tettle the matter he admitted that he was
Vrnng. The fellow is in hard luck, and
he thinks that I am indebted to him.
"1 met him in Butte. Mom., ajid. to tHI
you the truth. T have p*Â»hllv forgotteit hi*
r.nme. He wanted me t-> give him a hun
dred dollars and 1 couldn't see it that
way. When we talked the matter over
after leaving the rotunda I offered to
Ftake. him and he â  wouldn't take the
money." _.'

PACIFIC GP.OYK, Jan. 6.â The body of
â¢ n unknown man was found on the beach
of the United States Government reser
vation belonging to Point Pinos light
house station by M. F. Allen, a Stanford
University student, about 10 a. m. to-day.
Allen was collecting marine specimens for

an inquest. The deceased appeared to be
about 4S years old. Nothing was found
upon his person except a religious tract.
There is absolutely no clew to identity.
County Coroner H. V. Muller held an in

excitement here over the unusual circum
stances of the death, many believing the
man a suicide.
MARIN COUNTY HAS
BEEN IMPOSED UPON
So Bills Will Be Introduced in the
legislature in Reference to Collect-
ing Money From the State.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 6.â After a careful
investigation of the facts relating to the
contract to collect money said to be due
Marin County from the State on overpaid
taxes, as contained in the forceful com
munication sent the Board of Supervisors
by Cashier Augustine of the A. P. Hota-
ling Bank, that body has reached the con
clusion that it was imposed upon by the
law firm which has undertaken to secure
the money, and will make an endeavor to
have the contract rescinded. The propo
sition of whether or not this can be le
gally done has been submitted to District
Attorney Mclsaac.
â¢The contract. " says that official, "di
rects the District Attorney to bring suit
for the recovery of the money, and em
ploys the law firm to assist him. If he
should see fit not to bring suit it is my
opinion that the firm could do nothing in
the matter. I shall so advise the board."
At the request of several prominent eit-
Izens Mr. Augustine has drawn up two
bills, which have been sei.t to Senator
Dickinson and Assemblyman Atherton,
with a request that those representatives
urge their passage. The bills are
sweeping in their language. One is an act
repealing the act authorizing >c pay
ment of claims of the counties against
the State; the other provides that here
after no proceedings shall be taken by a
county official to recover any money "al
leged to be due from the State, except in
certain stated cases.
TELEPHONE COMPANIES
MAY ALL BE COMBINED
It Is Predicted That All the Bell Con
cerns "Will Be United in One
Corporation.
CLEVELAND, Jan. James P. i.ic-
Kinstry, general manager of the Cleve
land Telephone Company, which has just
absorbed all of the Bell telephone Inter
ests in the State of Michigan, stated to
day that eventually, he thought, all of
the Bell Telephone companies through
out the country would be consolidated into
one great organization. The Cleveland
Telephone Company now controls all the
Bell interests in the States of Minnesota,
Texas, Arkansas, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Michigan and the city of Cleve
land.
"As a matter of economy, if for no other
reason," said Mr. McKinstry, "I think
that sooner or later all the companies
working under Bell licenses will be com
bined into one great corporation, just as
all of the several telegraph companies of
this country were merged into the West
ern Union a quarter of a century ago.
However, I have no . orucial knowledge
that this step is at present being consid
ered, but there is a natural tendency to
j ward such a movement, and it is, In my
I opinion, bound to come."

dealers of Northern California will be as
sembled in convention, arrangements for
! which have been under way for several
1 weeks. While it is given out that the
' organization which will be the outcome of
this meeting is to partake solely of a
social nature, there is no doubt that the
promoters have a grievance to correct,
principally directed against wholesalers
who insist on retailing. Delegates have

SALE OF COPPEB MINES.
Arrangements Made to Buy the Go
linsky Property.
REDDING, Jan. s.â The probable sale of
j the Golinsky copper mines on I,ittle Back
| bone is announced, the purchasers being
a company of New York capitalists?. The
! purchase price is given as $150,000. The
property consists of a group of mines in
\ the sulphide belt, easily accessible by a
branch road from the main line of the
| Southern Pacific Company. It is, of
i course, a smeiting proposition, and there
is a.n ample site for a large plant.
1. Park Charming and A. H. Ricketts
supposed to be acting for Lewiston
Brothers, copper sales agents of New
I York City, were here conferring with the
owners, Golinsky, Weisermann & Clen
i denin, and an agreement was reached
yesterday. Operation of the mines will
add much to the business prosperity of
Redding.
A Napoleonic Silence.
LONDON, Jan. 7.â The Brussels corre
spondent of the Daily Telegraph , who has
secured an Interview with Prince Victor
Napoleon, says the Prince firmly declined
to discuss politics or the Dreyfus affair
saying:
"When the time comes for me to speak
I shall do so in the only way befitting a
Prince and the chief of a great party. I
shall say what is necessary and sign my
words with the glorious name I am proud
to bearâ Napoleon."

LUDLOW SEIZING
SPANISH RIFLES
Cubans Try to Keep the
Guns.
NOT ALLOWED BY LAW
AMERICANS TAKING NO
CHANCES IN HAVANA.
One Spanish Officer Who Wanted the
Soldiers to Come to His
House After
Arms.
Sreclal Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Jan. 6.â Major General
Ludlow, Governor of the Department
of Havana, has decided to issue a
proclamation inviting the surrender of
arms at the arsenal. Receipts will.be
given for the arms, which will be prob
ably returned later. There are sup
posed to be as many as 40,000 rifles in
private possession, held chiefly by for-
mer Spanish volunteers.
Acting on reports received from vari
ous agents, Adjutant General Greble
and Captain Blunt have searched at
night time this week, a dozen dwellings
and seized altogether about 300 rifles,
with a number of machetes.
The largest collection found in any
one instance was in a chocolate factory
where twenty rifles were found. Parties
of Cubans have been going into the
residences of former volunteers, taking
their rifles and handing them over to
the nearest American patrol. But this
is quite another matter. Nine Cubans
were caught in the act to-day, among
them a colonel, a captain and a lieu
tenant. They were arrested, taken be
fore General Ludlow, lectured roundly
and dismissed.
The military administration has no
objection to individuals having a re
volver or a sporting rifle or so in their
residences, and the searchers decline to
take the Aveapon in such cases. They
make seizures only where two or more
military rifles are found and no satis
factory explanation is forthcoming. A
Spaniard, formerly a colonel, asked
General Ludlow to-day to send to his
house and seize thirty Mausers, as he
did not seem to wish to give them up
voluntarily. This was done. A local
dealer in arms has 4500 rifles in stock,
but agrees not to sell them at present.
All these are simply precautionary
measures taken against any possible
disturbance.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â The Cabinet
at its meeting to-day gave special con
sideration to the administration of af
fairs in Cuba. There seems to be a mis
understanding among some of the peo
ple of Santiago as to the policy of the
Government with respect to the expen
diture of money collected from internal
revenue customs sources.
It is not believed that General "Wood,
who is in command at Santiago, mis
understands the purposes of the Gov
ernment, but in any event nothing will
be done in the matter until General
Wood arrives here. Then an effort will
be made to arrive at some general plan
for the handling of the receipts in the
! island. It seems certain, however, that
; all moneys disbursed must come
through a central head, and that under
no circumstances can any particular
city or section be allowed to expend all
of its collections to the neglect of other
sections. â 
General Wood, however, will receive
a proper and probably a sufficient al
lowance for Santiago province, but full
consideration Is certain to be given to
sections which collect nothing or little
from customs. It is very likely that
soon after General Wood's return to
Santiago the governors of the several
provinces will be instructed to assemble
for a discussion of the question of their
respective needs for administrative pur
poses and also for pressing internal im
provements. Thas it is expected that
a fair and enuitable distribution of the
funds collected on the island will be
secured.
OF INTEREST TO THE COAST.
Thomas E. Burns Will Be Appointed
Postmaster at San Mateo.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Thomas E.
Burns of San Mateo has been recommend
ed by Congressman Loud for Postmaster
of that place. Burns' appointment will
be announced shortly.
Senator White has introduced a bill
| amending the internal revenue collection
laws, providing for drawing distilled spir
its into wooden packages, upon applica
tion of the distiller, for export, the stamp
to cost not more than 5 cents. He also
introduced a bill increasing the salaries
of I'nited States Court Judges in Arizona,
New Mexico and Oklahoma to $5000.
Representative Loud appeared before
the River and Harbor Committee of the
House to-day and made an argument in
favor of dredging Alvlso slough and blow
ing out Arch and Shag rocks in San
Francisco Hay.
Pensions have been granted as follows:

FRANCE CONCEDED
LITTLE TO ENGLAND
The English Newspapers Do Not Like
the Madagascar Blue
Book.
LONDON, Jan. fi.â A blue book has just
been issued containing the correspondence
between Gre.it Britain and France on the
subject of the trade restrictions in Mada
gascar.
The only concession, apparently, which
has resulted from Lord Salisbury's nu
merous protests is the severation of the
decree confining the coast trade to French
vessels, of which M. del Casse, French
Foreign Minister, notified the British
Government in a dispatch dated Decem
ber 29 last.
All the morning papers comment upon
the blue book, asking how it is possible
to live in amity with a country which
tramples upon treaty rights and treats
a friendly country in such a manner.
The Times says: It is a good thing for
the world's peace that we are able to
possess our souls in patience under tne
pin pricks of the French, which, under
the cover of grandiloquent phrase, habit
ually act with a cupidity and the short
sighted cunning of the peasant.
ESTERHAZY ALONE
_AND IN EXILE
Has Little to Say of the Dreyfus
Affair, but That Little Is
Bitter.
LONDON, Jan. 7.-The Daily News pub
lishes this interesting interview which a
special correspondent in Holland has had
with Major Comte Ferdinand Walsin Es
terhazy, author of the Dreyfus borderau.
The correspondent says: "I found him
in a small, typical Dutch hotel. His face
betrayed the ravages of the anxiety of
recent months, . and he is terribly
lonely. He told me he had hardly spoken
to any one since he left England. He de
clined to say anything about the inquiry
now in progress before the Court of Cas
sation, but did Indulge in a violent anti-
Jewish tirade.

CHILKAT INDIANS
ARE FAMISHING
Starvation and Death Among the
Remnant of a Once
Powerful Tribe.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 6.â "Withered and old am I, the fish can
no longer take, the moose can no longer chase and life is no more for
me." This is the dirge of the famishing Chilkats. From the bleak
steppes to the south of Fort Selkirk, at the mouth of the Pelly and
Yukon, comes a wail of disease, starvation and death from the now
miserable remnants of the once powerful Chilkat tribe of Indians.
J. W. Lancing, superintendent of construction for the military bar
racks at Fort Selkirk, arrived by the City of Seattle, and he brings
news that the Chilkats are in sad need of food, and thro-ugh their
missionary, an Episcopalian, who has been five years among them,
they have applied to Colonel Evans, the officer In charge of the bar
racks, for relief. The steady influx of miners is driving them back
into the interior, the advent of the river steamers has frightened the
moose, cariboo and other game away and they now have to go at
least four or five days' journey before they can reach any hunting
ground. Then, too, the steamers and the host of prospectors have
totally destroyed their fisheries, on which to a great extent they were
dependent for their winter's food, and this winter the usual store of
dog salmon is wanting. They complain that the white men placed
neta and traps across the river above and they were unable to ob
tain enough fish for food. They are, Mr. Lancing says, in serious
want, and the half-starved condition of many of their number ren
ders them favorite subjects for the ravages of disease and it is not
surprising that many are down with la grippe, the military doctor
pronounces it. This has claimed many victims among them of late,
having in fact attained the proportions of a plague. Commandant
Evans has already distributed a large quantity of rations among the
Indians, but his store is rapidly running down, and unless some aid
arrives the Indians will be in a bad way indeed this winter. They are
very restless and the younger members of the tribe are reported to
be threatening retaliation on the miners for the less of their hunting
and fishing.
Mr. Lancing reports a big strike at the head of the McMillan. A
miner named Taylor arrived at Selkirk from there just before he left
with $11,000 for six weeks' work.

Man.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GOUVERNEUR, N. T.,Jan. 6.â Sheriff
George A. Storrs of Utah County, Utah,
left here yesterday accompanied by
Mrs. Jennie Wright. They are en route
to Utah in an endeavor to clear up a
murder mystery and to free, if possible,
a man from a life sentence.
At the Pelican Point Ranch, Utah, in
1595, three young men were shot down
one night in their ranch house. The
stepfather of one of the boys, named
Haynes, had had trouble Avith the men
and was arrested, charged with the
crime. The bodies of the men were
found sunk in Utah Lake and the prem
ises they had occupied were looted.
Haynes was convicted on circumstan
tial evidence and was sentenced to be
hanged, but a sta^ was secured and
the sentence commuted to life imprison
ment.
A short time after the crime George
W. Wright left that locality and lived
in various parts of tl.e West, finally
drifting to Freshwater, Colo. He was
a graduate of Kalamazoo Law College.
He soon became prominent, bearing the
sobriquet "King of Freshwater." One
morning a man with whom Wright was
at outs was found shot to pieces in his
cabin. Wright assisted at the Coro
ner's Inquest and wrote out the verdict
of '"murder by a person unknown."
Later Wright became involved in a
questionable sheep deal and after being
arrested jumped his bail and fled. He
visited his wife at her parents' home
here and then disappeared. After he
left the West evidence of a positive
character relating to the murder at
Freshwater is said to have been found
against Wright. The authorities elicited
a confession from Mrs. Wright to th ef
fect that her husband had goods which
figured in the Pelican Point murders.
The Utah authorities were communi
cated with and found the articles just
where she said.
Mrs. Wright said she was willing to
testify against her husband for the
triple crime provided he can be caught.
She says her lips have previously been
sealed through fear of him.
GERMAN MISSIONARY
BRUTALLY MALTREATED
Details of the Affair Which Gave
the Kaiser Some Chinese
Land.
BERLIN, Jan. 6.â Letters received here
to-day from Klachau, the German forti
fied settlement in the province of Shang
Tung, China, give details of an outrage
upon Father Stenz, the German Catholic
missionary, on November 9 last. The mis
sionary was about to leave Tie-Tau, prov
ince of Shang Tung, owing to the anti-
Christian feeling.
Finding himself confronted by crowds
of Chinese, who were clamoring for the
destruction of the Christians, he took
refuge in a hut. but he was dragged out,
his clothing torn from his back and ho
was struck with sticks and pricked with
knives and lances and his beard torn out.
The Chinese threatened to flay him alive.
On the following day his persecutors
prepared to hang him by the wrists.
Finally a mandarin interfered in his be
half, but compelled him to leave the dis
trict with a promise never to return.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6. â CoÃonel
Henry Sharp of the commissary de
partment, who served at Camp Thomas
and in Porto Rico during the war, was
before the War Investigating Commit
tee to-day. He said that he had su
perintended the issue and inspection of
refrigerated beef in Porto Rico; that
he had been in the commissary depart
ment for fifteen years, and that the
quality of the fresh beef issued at Camp
Thomas was equal to any he had ever
seen in the army.
Governor Bpaver read to the witness
parts of Surgeon W. H. Daly's report
to General Miles on the "embalmed
beef" issued at Camp Thomas and
asked if he had noticed the "mawkish
taste" and "disgusting odor" of the
beef referred to.
Colonel Sharp said the report ln^
question referred to a time after wit
ness left Camp Thomas, and said posi
tively that the description did not ap- 1
ply to any of the beef he had seen. In
Porto Rico, he said, he had inspected
one vessel of refrigerator beef at Ar
royo and the beef was the "wonder and
admiration" of all the natives and of
the foreign residents, none of whom
had ever seen such good beef.
The native cattie in Porto Rico, he
said, were infinitely inferior to the
American refrigerator beef. He knew
of no chemically preserved meat issued
to the army.
Colonel Sharp thought the loss of the
spoiled beef which had been in qupp
tion fell to the contractors and not to
the Government.
Now Charged With Murder.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 6.â Almost two
months ago Jose Jaccino, one of the Capi
tan Grande Indians on the reservation ,
twenty miles east of this city, in a row
with Manuel Lugo, another Indian, at a
fiesta held at that time, assaulted the
latter most brutally with rocks and cob
ble-stones, beating him so badly that
Lugo was nearly dead before any one
could interfere. Lugo has lingered along
in a precarious condition until to-day, his
assailant having been held in custody on
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon
to await the result of the injuries. This
morning Lugo died of his wounds, and the
charge of murder was entered against
Jaccino.

PRESIDENT DID NOT
WANT THE ISLANDS
NEW YORK. Jan. 6.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The Senate passed to-day the Hoar res
olution requesting the President to send
to the Senate the instructions given to
the Peace Commissioners.
I asked one of the leading members
of the Committee on Foreign Relations
what was the significance of the adop
tion of the Hoar resolution. He re
plied that in view of the fact that it
was so broad in its nature and left so
much to the discretion of the President
it would not be embarrassing either to
the administration or to the friends ( f
the treaty in the Senate.
"It is not reasonable." he added, "to
suppose that the President will be in
clined to repeat every verbal suggestion
or purely confidential message he has
a right to deliver to his Commission
ers. If the motive of the resolution
was to prove that the Commissioners
went to Paris without any instructions
as to the acquisition by the United
States of the entire Philippine group
there need be no mystery on that B
It Is known that the President original
ly had no desire or intention of taking
all of the Philippines. He simply de
sired us to take Luzon Island. It is
known that Mr. Day did not pro
pose to go to that extent. He simply
advocated taking one of the islands, or
a portion of one of the islands, to 'Â»c
used as a coaling station. There are
other members of the commission who
entertained similar views, but circum
stances arose which rendered it i.
sary to take the entire group.
"Unless I am very much mistaken,
th^ members of the commission are pre
pared to make it perfectly clear to their
associates in the Senate and to con
vince the majority of the American
people that the pending treaty is the
outcome of earnest and faithful delib
erations and in the interest of the
American people."
AGUINALDO FORMERLY
FAVORED ANNEXATION
WASHIXGTON, Jan. 6.â The corre
spondence published officially in con
nection with the peace treaty contains
much of interest from Consul Williams,
who was stationed at Manila prior to
the war. He was in constant commu
nication with Aguinaldo for some time
after the battle of Manila Bay and his
letters throw much light upon the re
lations with the Philippine chieftain.
As early as February 22 last Mr. Wil
liams wrote:
The Governor General, who is amiable
and popular, having resigned, wishes
credit for pacification, and certain I
leaders were given a cash bribe of $4<JO,<.MW
to consent to public deportation to China.
This bribe and deportation only multi
plied claimants and fanned the fires of
discontent.
On March 19 he complained that his
letters and telegrams were tampered
â with. Mr. Williams also stated that
every leisure hour was devoted to the
inspection of the forts, arsenals and
battleships in and about Manila, even
at that early day, and that he was
sending information thus derived to
Commodo-re Dewey, who, with his fleet,
was then at Hongkong. Spies were so
thick that he did not dare copy his dis
patches in his office books.
Mr. Williams left Manila on April 23.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JAKUARY 7, 1899.
writes on June 16, "that his friends all
hoped the Philippines would be held as
a cc-lony of the United States "
This was only four days after the first
i formation of a provisional government
'by the natives. Mr. Williams says he
was invited to be present when this
government was organized by the Fili
pinos, but that he declined. For this
he afterward received a note of ap
proval from the State Department.
On August 4 he wrote:
It has been my study to keep on pleas
ant terms with Aguinaldo for ultimate :
objects. Admiral Pewey says I have
planted the seeds of cordial co-operation.
: My agreement with Aguinaldo has been
j that the conditions of government by the
United States in the Philippine Islands
I would be vastly better for him and his
le in honor, advancement and profit
! than could exist under any plan fixed by
himself and Filipinos. I have traversed i
the entire ground of government with him
in counsel, and he has called his officials
, from fifteen provinces to meet for their
; discussion, as stated, friendly but unoffi
cial on my part.
On September 5 Mr. Williams cabled:
"To-day delegations from 4000 Viscayan
soldiers and also representing southern
business interests came to me, pledging
loyalty to annexation. Several insur
gent leaders likewise, f nain cannot
control. If we evacuate anarchy rules."
On July IS Consul Wildman wrote to
the Secretary of State expressing his
views on the then reported policy of the
United States Government to allow the
Philippine Islands to return to Spain.
Among other things he said, after giv
ing the particulars of his long residence
and intimate acquaintance among the
people of the Straits Settlement:
I consider the forty or fifty Philippine
leaders with whose fortunes I have been
closely connected both the superiors of '
the Malays and Cubans. Aguinaldo,
Agencillo and Sandico are all men who
would be leaders in their separate depart
ments in any country, while among the i
wealthy Manila men who live in Hong
kong and who ar<* spending their money
liberally for the overthrow of the Span
iards and annexation to the United States,
men like the Cortez family and the Paza
family, would hold their own among
bankers and lawyers anywhere. In spite \
â¢if statements to the contrary, I know
they are lighting for annexation to the
United States first and for independence
secondly. In fact, I have had the most
prominent leaders call on me and say that
they would not raise one finger unless I
could assure them that the United States
intended to give them United States citi- ;
/.unship if they wanted it. There has been
;i systematic attempt to blacken the name
of Aguinaldo and his Cabinet on account
of the cjuestionable terms of their surren
der to Spanish forces a year ago this
month. It has been said that they sold
their country for gold, but this has been
conclusively disproved, not only by their
own statements, but by the speech of
the late Governor General Rivera in tn>;
Spanish Senate. I was in Hongkong ,
in September, ISO", when Aguinaldo ami
his leaders arrived under contract with
the Spanish Government. They waited
until the Ist of November for the pay
ment of the money promised for the wid
ows and orphans of the insurgents and
the fulfillment of promised reforms. Only
00 Mexican money was placed to
their credit.
Mr. Wildman says that on the break- '
ing out of the war he received a dele
gation from the insurgent junta and
they bound themselves to obey all laws
of civilized warfare and to place them
selves absolutely under the orders of I
Admiral Dewey if they were permitted
to return to Manila. He says that on
April 27, after another conference, he
agreed, on behalf of Dewey. to allow
two <>f the insurgent delegations to j
accompany the fleet to Manila, he going
with them. It was only later that he
prevailed on Admiral Dewey to allow j
Aguinaldo to go. Referring to Agrui
naldo's organization of a government,
he says it was absolutely necessary to
take such a step to maintain control
over the natives. In conclusion Mr.
Wildman says:
I wish tn put myself on record as stat
ing that the insurgent government of the
Philippine Islands cannot be dealt with
as though they were Xorth American In
dians, willing to be removed from one
reservation to another at the whim of
their masters. If the United States O.f
clded not to retain the Philippine Islands
its 10,000/iuO people will demand independ
ence, and the attempt of any foreign na
tion to obtain territory or coaling stations
will be resisted with the same spirit with
which they fought the Spaniards.
The correspondence shows that Mr.
Wildman was warned not to make
pledges or discuss policy with Agui
naldo and that he replied that he made
him no pledges and exacted from him
but two, viz.: To obey unquestionably
the commander of the United States
forces in the Philippine Islands and to
conduct his warfare on civilized lines
Wildman further says:
Aguinaldo ha? written me by every op
portunity, ar.rl I believe he has* been frank
with me. both regarding his actions and
his motives. I do not doubt that he would
like to be President of the Philippine re
public, and there may be a small coterie
of his native advisers who entertain a
like ambition, but I am perfectly certain
that the great majority of his followers
and all the wealthy and educated Fili
pinos have but one desire â to become citi
zens of the United States. As for the mass
of uneducated natives they will be con
tent with any rule save that of the friars.
Consul General Pratt, stationed at
Singapore, details his last interview
with Aeruinaldo, saying that he en
joined upon the Philippine leader the
necessity, under Commodore Dewey's
directions, of assuming absolute control
over his forces in the Philippines, since
no excesses on their part would be
tolerated by the United States. Pratt
states that to this injunction Apui
naldo expressed the hope that "the
United States would assume protection
over the Philippines for at least long
enough to allow the inhabitants to es
tablish a government of their own, in
the organization r*f which he would de
sire American advice and assistance."
AGONCILLO "bisiRES
DIPLOMATIC STANDING
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Senor Agon
cillo, who is in Washington as the rep
j resentative of the Philippine Govern
ment, has asked to be recognized by
: the United States as such and to be
I accorded the same rights as the other
j diplomats. His request is now in the
hands of Secretary Hay. To-day Don
Slxto Lopez, the private secretary of
! Senor Agoncillo, visited the State De
. partment and presented to the officials
j a letter to Secretary Hay requesting
| on behalf of Senor Agoncillo an inter- j
i view for the purpose of arranging to
j present his credentials to President
McKinley and inquiring when it would
meet the co-nvenience of the President
to meet the Philippine representative.
The letter of Senor Lopez further
i states that he is instructed by Senor
Agoncillo, in view of recent develop- i
ments, to urge the advisability of a.n j
j understanding between the American i
; Government and the representative of !
| the Philippine people as to the rela- i
j tions between the respective nations;
: such understanding to be reached either
I at Washington, through the joint rep- i
j resentatives of the two governments, !
or in the Philippine Islands in a like !
manner.
The letter concludes with an expres
; sion of the earnest hope that the friend- j
ly relations heretofore existing between
; the two peoples may ever be main
[ tamed.
Accompanying the letter is a memor
< andum setting forth the establishment
of the Philippine republic and the pro- I
vision for a detailed system of govern- '
: ment. From the facts submitted, says !
Senor Agoncillo, "it will appear that ;
the Philippine Government Is now and j
i it has been practically ever since June i
IS, 1898, substantially in full possession l
of the terrtiory of the people it repre
sents."
SACRAMENTO HAS
A TAX COLLECTOR
Decision of the Superior Court Segre
gating His Office From That
of the Sheriff.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 6.â Judge Hughes
of the Superior Court to-day rendered an
opinion deciding that B. N. Bugbey is
entitled to the office of Tax Collector.
In 1574 the offices of Shertff and Tax
Collector in Sacramento County were con
solidated by the Legislature and it has
been the claim of the incumbent. Sheriff
Johnson, that such act has never been
repealed. Judge Hughes is of the opin
ion, however, that the legislative act re
ferred to was repealed by the general
county government act passed by the
Legislature in 1883 in pursuance of a man
datory provision of the constitution of
the State for a uniform system of county
government.
Bugbey brought suit prior to the last
general elortion to be permitted to go on
the ticket as a candidate for Tax Collec
tor and won his point. After the ballot
appeared with his printed name other
candidate? sprang up and made a canva.?
by requesting voters to write their names
under that of Bugbey. The latter, how
ever, had the inside track and in due time
secured his certificate of election. When
he appeared last Monday and claimed
the office Sheriff Johnson declined to turn
the Tax Collector's books over to him.
hence the suit which to-day was decided
in Bugbey'fl favor.
The salary is 14300 In all. out of which
Bugbey must pay the salaries of two
deputies.
CONGRESSMAN DINGLEY
CLOSE TO DEATH
Worse Last Night, and Physicians
Hold Out Little Hope of
Recovery.
"WASHINGTON*. Jan. Â«.â The condition
of Representative Nelson Dlngley of
Maine, who has been ill with pneumonia
for almost a week, has undergone a
marked change for the worse, and to
night his physicians hold out little if any
hope of recovery. Although the lung has
improved considerably and the cough les
sened, the effect of the pneumonia has so
weakened the system as to decrease the
vitality to an alarming extent. The poi
son from the sickness has permeated the
whole system, which renders it less po
tent to stand the terrible strain. Much of
the day the patient was delirious and ap
peared to be uttering extracts from
speeches he had made on the tariff ques
tion In the House of Representatives. He
was conscious only when aroused. The
physicians say tnere must be a radical
change one way or the other very soon.
THE VOLUNTEER ENGINEERS
There Is an Unwillingness to Grant
Their Discharge.
WASHINGTON*. Jan. 6.â Senator Per
kins and other public men are receiving
great numt>ers of telegrams relating to
the discharge of the Volunteer Engineers.
Those officers were enlisted for the war,
and upon the ratification of the peace
treaty there will be no funds at the dis
posal" of the department for paying them.
There is an unwillingness to grant dis
charges, BO great is the necessity for the
services' of these officers, and as the ap
propriations for their compensation will
not much longer be availahle an effort
will be made to have Congress make pro
vision for their retention in the service.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. Jan. 6.â The sensa
tional developments in the Rains-Walls
election contest, wherein it was shown
i by a reeoun. of the ballots in the Su
j perior Court here this week that gross
I frauds had been perpetrated in count
! ing the votes cast in Wilson Precinct,
have just been followed by a tragic
sequel. As a result Demus Gale, one of
the oldest and most highly respected
residents of Sonoma County, now lies
I in his coffin with a bullet imbedded in
| his brain.
In the last election Gallant Rains was
I the candidate of the Democratic party
| for Supervisor from the Fourth Dis
trict. David Walls was named by the
i Republicans. The fight between the
! two was a spirited one and when the
j election was over a canvass of the votes
1 showed that Walls had been elected by
' a majority of 17. Rains brought suit
j to contest the election, with tlje result
that it was shown conclusively he had
been deliberately robbed of fifty votes
by the election board of Wilson Pre
cinct.
The disclosures made a great sensa
tion, the papers demanding that the
author of the crime be arrested and
punished. Gale was a member of the
election board in Wilson Precinct, and
acted as inspector. When the fact that
a crime had been committed was made
public he seemed to imagine that his
friends might connect him with the af
fair and took it much to heart. His
friends told him he had no reason for
so thinking, but he could not get over
the feeling and late last night he com
mitted suicide by shooting himself
through the brain. No one believes Mr.
Gale knew anything about the frauds.
During the campaign he fought Rains
very strongly, but his work was per
fectly legitimate and he made an open
fight. It is apparent that the matter
30 preyed upon his mind that it became
unbalanced.
Gale left a letter stating that he was
not connected in any way with the
crime.
The suicide has created a great sen
sation. Gale was a member of the
Grand Jury, was In comfortable .cir
cumstances and was one of the repre
sentative men of Petaluma Township.
The letter left was as follows:
I will state as it appears from the re
count of the "Wilson precinct there has
bepn some fraud perpetrated by some ono
or more of the board. I will state as one
of the board that I had no understanding
with any one in regard to using any un
fair means in order to defeat any one. I
opened part of the ballots and" no one
looked over them with me. I passed quite
a number without looking at them, which
leaves me no chance of defending myself.
I have been informed by a trusted friend
about everything that has taken place. I
know of no plot in this affair, and I can
bear up no longer under this trouble.

DOCTOR SWEANY'S
COMBINED TREATMENT
-p? JHE GREAT CURATIVE POWERS* } .
Don't use drugs says a doctor who has only electricity to offer. Don't
use electricity another would say who has only drugs to offer.
Each would speak the truth in some cases, and yet in many cases both
would advise wrongly, simply because medicine will cure in many cases
where electricity will only give temporary relief, and in a few cases electric-
ity properly administered may effect a cure where medical treatment
would fail. So it Is with electricity or medicine when used alone.
Reader, did it ever occur to you that Dr. Sweany's Electro-Medical
Treatment will cure nearer 100 per cent of all cases than any other system
of treatment known to the world? Does it not appeal to your intelligence
that the curative powers of the two scientifically combined will accom-
plish more than either if used alone? If you want quick results and cure
without delay or failure, apply to Dr. Sweany's offices and get the combined
benefit of both medical and electrical treatment and be assured that by this
combined treatment, as administered by the direction of this capable spe-
cialist, you will obtain immediate results more reaching In its effects,
quicker, more satisfactory and permanent cures. You can also understand
that by means of this combined treatment difficult cases can be cured where
all other known means have failed.
If you cannot call at Dr. Sweany's offices for treatment, send at once for
his ELECTRO-MEDICAL BELT. The first and only combined electro-
medical belt ever made. It is the product of this competent and ever pro-
gressive specialist, who stands far ahead of any in the matter of scientific,
skillful and successful methods of treating and curing the sick and suffer-
ing. The belt will give you the benefit at once of both electricity and medi-
cation. This belt has a patent regulator so that you can regulate the cur-
rent, making it strong or weak as the case may require. It has also an
improved scrotal electrode which will carry as much current into and
through the sexual organs as can be tolerated. The medicated part of the
belt is interposed between the electrodes and comes directly in contact with
the surface of the body; the medical virtues are taken up and absorbed
into the system by "Osmotic Action." Hence you get at once and the same
time the fiill effects of both electrical and medical treatment, and the bene*
fits you will derive will be TWO FOLD, relief will be distinctly felt at once
and the results desired will be doubly satisfactory.
Remember that Dr. Sweany is not established here for the sole purpose
of selling belts and appliances, but it is his purpose to cure the sick and
suffering of all kinds and classes and to offer to the people a pleasant, con-
venient and doubly successful means of obtaining relief and cure of theii-
many diseases and ailments. So, reader, if you are a sufferer and cannot
call at his offices, send $10 at once and receive one of his electro-medical
belts. You will never regret it, for by so doing you will place yourself
fairly on the highway to complete health and happiness, as you will then
practically be under the care and treatment of the most successful special-
ist, whom you can consult at any time, either personally or by letter, free of
charge. This electro-medical belt Is neat, clean and not cumbersome and
may be worn day and night, or only at night. WORKS WHILE YOU
SLEEP!
There are two classes of diseases wherein the combined electro-medical
treatment accomplishes wonderful results: First, in the class of diseases
termed neurasthenia, in other words, nervous debility, especially of men, re-
sulting from any cause whatever, either from youthful follies or subse-
quent excesses causing breaking down of the kidneys, sexual organs, sto- :
mach, heart and the whole nervous system. Second, in the many distress-
ing and nervous ailments peculiar to women. If all of those men and wo.
men who have suffered long and have perhaps met with repeated failures In
their efforts to get well would try tins electro-medical treatment, or send for
an electro-medical belt, I dare say nothing on earth could prevent them
from pursuing a full course of treatment with complete and joyful restora-
tion to perfect health.

THE EXAMINER AND DAN BURNS.
THE Examiner of Wednesday devoted an entire
column of its editorial page to two extracts from
The Call of Tuesday last, in one of which the
following words occurred: "For obvious reasons
the Examiner will never effectively resist corruption
in the choice of a Federal Senator."
The comments upon the passage quoted wholly ig
nored this significant language and are devoted to an
argument to prove the falsehood that The Call sup
ported the Republican legislative ticket in San Fran
cisco with the consciousness that it had been named
by William F. Herrin and Dan Burns, and that Dan
Burns was a candidate for United States Senator.
There has been no evidence so far, except as to two
members, that the Republican legislative ticket either
lure <<v anywhere else in this State was named by Mr.
Herrin <>r by Dan Burns, or by both of them together.
â¢1 he presumption ami appearances are the other way.
It i- quite certain that, if any such combination had
really transpired, that legislative ticket would have
been defeated, not through the Examiner, but through
the Republican press, h is also certain that before
the election no one could have suspected, much less
have known, the genuine candidacy of Dan Burns. It
i- not certain even now that it is genuine, and the ob
jective point may be. some one else. In this respect
the information of the Examiner is probably more
direct than that of The Call.
k i^ not what the Examiner Ins said but what it
has left unsaid that will interest the public. There
Was no charge or fear of corruption in the election of
Perkins or of Senator White. But before
they represented the State there were Senatorial elec
tions in which the corrupt use of money was so well
authenticated that even the amounts paid by success
ful candidates have been repeatedly expressed in fig
ure-. Where was the Examiner in those compara
tively recent days? Let it search its own files dili-
gently and see if it can rind any effective resistance to
the bribery which at the time other journals de
nounced, or whether its columns were eloquently si
lent when the public interests demanded exposure and
conviction.
The "milk in the cocoanut" still remains there. It
has not even been reached by the comments of the
Examiner upon manufactured facts and dishonest in
ferences, which evade the real issue.
THE WAGES OF SEAMEN.
' IZJ ASTERN free trade organs, in their opposition
to the proposed legislation in favor of upbuild
â* ing our merchant marine, have asserted that the
rate of wages paid by American ship-owners is not
notably higher than that paid by ship-owners of other
countries. As a result there has been a sharp discus
sion on the question, and out of it there has come a
letter to the Boston Journal from a typical seafaring
man, the mate of a New England coasting schooner,
which gives what is perhaps the most interesting evi
dence brought out on either side.
The story of this seaman as condensed by the
Journal is that he has been following the sea for a
third of a century. Tie has sailed in the British mer
chant marine, the German â he is a German by birth â
and the American. Out of his thirty-three years' ex
liericnce under all flaps and in all the waters of the
globe, he declare? that "this i? the only country where
a man is paid and fed and has accommodations
to live in."
Just by way of illustration he adds that before he
catrfe to America he was first mate of a large German
sailing ship of 1800 tons, with wages of $15 a month.
He iÂ« now mate of a two-masted American schooner,
.and his wages are $30 a month! The sailors on that
German ship were paid $8 a month; on the American
schooner they are paid $25. "As to the food, the
.'grub' you call it here, we got on our German yes-
- sel, it was not fit to live on. I could not go back and
live on it again, and the Gorman ships live 75 per
cent better than the English, for I have been on
both."
That sort of testimony is more impressive than stat
istic*. It has the verve and vigor of a human per
sonality in it. It settles the discussion over seamen's
os by the statements of actual experience. The
free traders who are going to continue their opposi
te the promotion of an American merchant
mariue must pet some other ground for it than that
wages. The American sailor, like the land
â¢<er of the country, is entitled to legislation that
will protect his wages from the competition of the
underpaid labor of Europe.
Police Lieutenant Hannah, having been found
drunk on Market street, should be dismissed from the
force. A lieutenant who lacks the judgment to con
fine his jamborees to less frequented thoroughfares is
not tit for his position.
The resolution to have nothing to drink at the in
augural ball commends itself to the judgment. There
are plenty of saloons in Sacramento, without estab
lishing a jag mill at the CapitoL
AGENTS Of CORRUPTION.
AT the Capital City, where there is in
progress the skirmish preliminary to a Sena
torial election, the ugly head of corruption has
already reared itself. Bribery, intimidation and fraud
are the instruments employed for the purpose of elect
ing to a station where patriotism, probity, lofty ideals
and practical sense, dignity, a high conception of honor,
must be requisites of any fitting incumbent. Even the
circumstance that political rounders, social outcasts,
gamblers and thugs are active in attempts to shape the
destinies of the commonwealth to their own purposes
is enough to bring a blush to the face of manhood. |
That they should be directed and abetted by office- â 
holders and jobbers shows that public affairs have
fallen to a low estate.
There is only one remedy. These unclean creatures
must be hurled from power to which they never had a
right, and which they have abused until decency,
humiliated and outraged, clamors a protest. Let them
go home baffled and forever deprived of their evil
potency. Let the Federal brigade be shown that no
set of place-holders can safely use their positions to
forward base ends, or to place upon fair California a
lasting brand of shame. The State has already en
dured- too much from its Dans and its Gunsts, its
Jakes and its Dennerys.
That Burns is trying to buy his way to the Senate
there has never been doubt since the rising of the first
suspicion that he possessed the unspeakable effrontery j
to thrust himself into a contest where the light of i
publicity would be turned full upon him. His record j
has been stained and spotted by crime, and there has
been from him no expression of regret for his mis
deeds. He has battened and thriven until he is rich
and arrogant and brazen. He defies all tenets of re
spectability, and demands that a State which failed
to punish him for his crimes shall "vindicate" him by
sending him to the Senate. Ungrateful to have es
caped the penitentiary, he wants an apology for the
ttlling of the truth. As well and a 6 logically could
the State erect a monument to the memory of
Durrant.
The election of Burns would be the worst single
blow the Legislature could administer to California.
It would be an insult to citizenship and to the coun
cil of the nation.
The opportunity to turn to Grant has been im
paired by the indiscreet supporters of the gentleman
from San Diego. They have permitted themselves to
appear in the attitude of bribers. Dan Cole, grown
gray in politics, and ever lucky at finding himself in
receipt of a salary, in his enthusiasm for Grant offered
to pay the campaign expenses of Assemblyman
Clough, the condition being that Clough sign a
pledge to support Grant for the Senate. Cole pro
claims that this was done on his own motion and with-
out the knowledge of anybody else, but it has a sin
ister look and has hurt the cause it was designed to
strengthen. Knowing Burns to be the epitome of all
that is bad in politics, the public has been inclined to
place him on a plane below that occupied by any
other candidate. The exposure of Cole's scheme
tends to make the plane of the two a common one.
Burns cannot win by corruption. Grant cannot
win by corruption. It will be a marvel, even in the
absence of further revelations, if there shall not be
created a revulsion sweeping them both from the
field.
The Sacramento Bee says that Judge Belcher is un
fit to sit on the bench, basing this assertion on the fact
that the Judge intimates a willingness to see the
thieves of the late School Board hanged. Many
others also would like to see them hanged, and
would deem it a duty to pull on the rope if somebody
else had the nerve to provide the rope. Judge Belcher
is all right. The Bee has simply failed in this particu
lar instance to know what it is talking about, with
it a rare fault.
The lady who says she bought a box of candy the
same day Mrs. Botkin is alleged to have bought it
owes the prisoner an apology for diffidence in coming
forward. A natural impulse would have been to save
Mrs. Botkin the discomfort of a sentence for life.
Certainly an innocent woman would have a right to
feel aggrieved at the experience.
THE DEMAND FORCURRENCY REFORM
A SHORT time ago a committee representing
the American Economic Association submitted
a report setting forfh the importance of giving
to our present gold standard the validity and vitality
oi' law and establishing our currency system upon a
safe and sound basis.
In the course of this report, after reviewing the
monetary conditions of the country, the committee
said: "In the light of these facts your committee
are of the opinion that what is most needed at this
juncture is a disposition on the part of the friends of
reform to sink individual preferences as to details and
to insist that Congress shall enact such legislation
as it shall be possible to agree upon."
Furthermore, the committee added: "Never before
has there existed among all classes so great an inter
est on this subject, so near an approach to unanimity
of opinion, and so strong a purpose to see something
accomplished." That passage has had the effect of so
arousing the wrath of the New York Sun as to move
it to sarcasm, and in commenting upon the report it
said:
"The representatives of the people in Congress,
who may be supposed to know the sentiments of their
constituents, declare, on the contrary, that little or
no interest prevails in the subject among any class,
and that there is a strong purpose not to see anything
accomplished. This being so, it is not worth while to
enter into controversy with the professors. We leave
them to their own delusions."
From what source the Sun derived its conclusion
that there is a strong desire among the people not to
see anything accomplished in the direction of settling
the financial issues of the time is a question to which
the Sun itself offers no answer. On that subject its
light is in eclipse and shines for nobody, and in the
absence of any information on which to base a reply
we shall have to pass the point and leave the Sun to
its own delusions.
There are abundant evidences to show that the
Economic Association is right in asserting that the
people of the country recognize the necessity of hav
ing this issue settled at once. At a recent meeting of
the Chicago Commercial Club, for example, the issue
was discussed and a resolution adopted declaring:
"The matter of most pressing. and immediate impor
tance to the American nation after the impending
ratification of the treaty of peace is the building of a
stable foundation for the national monetary system."
From similar bodies of men in all parts of the
THE BAK FRAJSCIBCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1899.
Union similar declarations have come. All the great
business interests of the country are a unit on the
subject. The Republican party owes its success in the
elections of 1896 and of 1898 to its emphatic pledges
in favor of the gold standard and a sound currency.
Those pledges must be fulfilled or it will be hard for
the party to hold the confidence of the people in the
next election. It is evidently time for the Sun to
borrow a light and try to learn what is going on in
the world since Charles A. Dana died.
CAN NO CLEfJN fJND fIBLE MON BE
FOUND?
IT is doubtful if history records a more vital debate
than that which preceded the adoption of the com
promise measures of 1850 when, as a free State,
California was admitted into the Union. The great
statesmen of the country, then grouped in the cham
ber of the Federal Senate, were almost transfigured
in the blazing light of that patriotism which extin
guished the lesser fires of sectional hatred and for
eleven years averted the Civil War. This common
wealth received the most sacred rite of baptism that
had ever attended the addition of a new star to the
American constellation.
The mighty intelligence, the passionate love of
country, the loftiness of sentiment, the high aspira
tions for their race, that poured from the lips of Clay
and Webster, who, like Simeon, were ready to de
part when their, eyes had witnessed the consummation
of their hopes, raised the dignity of the American
Senate, composed of the representatives of powerful
American communities between two oceans, to such
a height that it has ever since commanded the respect
ful attention of the world.
"It is fortunate," said Mr. Webster, March 7, 1850,
"that there is a Senate of the United States, a body
not yet moved from its propriety nor lost to a just
sense of its own dignity and its own high responsi
bilities, and a body to which the country looks with
confidence for wise, moderate, patriotic and healing
counsels." And on the following July 22 Henry
Clay unveiled his own nobility of soul in these words,
which ought to be imprinted upon every American
heart:
"And now let us discard all resentment, all passions,
all petty jealousies, all personal desires, all love of
place, all hankerings after the gilded crumbs which
fall from the table of power. Let us forget popu
lar fears, from whatever quarter they may spring. Let
us go to the limpid fountain of unadulterated patriot
ism and, performing a solemn lustration, return di
vested of all selfish, sinister and sordid impurities, and
think alone of our God, our country, our consciences
and our glorious Union."
Since this important epoch in our national career
the unbroken line of States has been stretched across
the continent. The Gadsden purchase completed the
symmetrical development of our territory. Alaska
Hanked the Canadian Confederation and brought us
face to face with the advancing progress of Russia.
The war with Spain has ended, and now, whether for
good or for evil, our banner floats over Porto Rico
and Manila, ten thousand miles apart.
Those who stand on the higher level of observation
can already discern the splendors of an unprecedented
future piercing the gloom that shrouds the close of
the nineteenth century, and far in the East the twen
tieth century, the Golden Age of the Pacific, already
dawns. The expanding life, wealth, population, in
telligence, education and enterprise of our country
have brought us into direct contact with opportuni
ties and with questions that demand in the deliberative
body, where forty-six restricted sovereignties, in the
name of the Union, of which they are inseparable
part?, proclaim their policy and record their will, such
depth and vigor of statesmanship as the world has
rarely witnessed. Perhaps the very crisis of our na
tional fate is at hand. Labor and capital, commerce,
trade, finance, all the elements of modern civilization
in its most advanced form, with the constitution as
its base and American fraternity as its energizing
force, are demanding adjustment, without break or
disturbance of the republic, to new conditions and the
solution of questions in which the prospects of hu
manity itself arc involved.
And. while this grand panorama is unfolding itself
to our view, and California, golden in its soil, in its
products, in its sons and in its daughters, proudly
awaits the magnificent destiny that is almost within
its grasp, narrow selfishness, foul ambition, filthy cor
ruption and stupid ignorance deliberately propose that
Dan Burns or his double shall be its embassador in
the chamber which Webster apotheosized and where
Clay immortaiized American manhood!
Here is a picture for our legislators to contemplate,
and with the pressure of their pledges and their oaths,
and of their moral and intellectual responsibilities to
their constituencies weighing upon them, they are
privileged to determine whether an obnoxious Lili
putian shall usurp the place of such a man as Cali
fornia needs. We live under representative institu
tions â is it conceivable that such a Senator should
represent the State? Among a million and a half of
people is there no wise, conservative, broad-minded,
instructed, clean-hearted, prescient American states
man to be found who will hold up the honor, the dig
nity and the interests of this commonwealth before
the country and before the world?
This is the immediate question of questions which
the Legislature, so far unimpeached and unsullied,
will have an opportunity to answer on Tuesday next.
Shall Burns or his double reduce and degrade the
State to the proportions of a pothouse politician, or
shall a selection be made upon which citizens and
corporations, all men and all bodies, in whom Ameri
can blood in circulating, can unanimously agree?
Highbinders have been posing as educators in the
hope of escaping the police. Such an effort to copy
the Board of Education which has just retired cov
ered with dishonors shows the imitative faculty of the
Oriental mind.
Government beef, described as having green
whiskers, may be all right f^om the standpoint of the
contractors, but the consumers cannot be regarded as
over punctilious if they were to demand that it be
shaved.
Oakland ministers have denounced Burns. The
province of a preacher is to fight evil, and while he
dees not ordinarily dip into politics, he could not
well overlook such an opportunity as Burns affords.
The politician who says "Get thee behind me,
Satan," must not have an open palm at his back, or
he will be suspected of insincerity.
Doubtless this country can whip Aguinaldo, and
doubtless he deserves it, but we did not realize the
sort of snap we were acquiring.
Governor Pingree will never be happy until ap
pointed censor of the universe and umpire of the
! game of life.
As to th.it treaty of peace with Spain, most of the
peace seems to have been acquired by that country.
Dan Cole may look like Lincoln, but his political
methods are different.
HANNA-PAYNE SHIPPING BILL.
On December 19, 1898, there was introduced in the Senate a bill by Mr.
Hanna under the title of "A bill to promote the commerce and increase tne
foreign trade of the United States, and to provide auxiliary cruisers, trans
ports and seamen for Government use when necessary."
This bill is the outcome of the labors for over a year of a committee 01
shipbuilders, ship owners and merchants, and is supposed to unite all ruc
tions whose antagonism has hitherto prevented effective legislation. me
main features of the bill are as follows:
Commencing July 1, 1599, and continuing for a period of twenty years,
subsidies are to be paid as hereinafter follows, to all existing vessels or
American register whose owners will build within the next five years an
amount of tonnage equal to not less than 25 per cent of the gross amount
of tonnage to which the subsidy is paid.
For sailing vessels and steamships under fourteen knots speed, engaged
in trade with foreign countries distant over 150 miles from port of depar
ture in the United States, 1% cents per gross ton for each 100 miles for me
first 1500 miles sailed both outward and homeward bound, and 1 cent per
gross ton for each 100 miles over 1500 miles sailed both outward and home
ward bound.
In addition to the foregoing remuneration, steamships suitable for mail
and auxiliary cruisers will receive the following subsidies for each 100 miles
sailed both outward and homeward bound:
Vessels over 1500 tons gross registerâ . _
14 knots and less than 15 knots speed 1 cent per gross ton.
15 knots and less than 16 knots speed 1.1 cents per gross ton.
16 knots or over 1.2 cents per gross ton.
Vessels over 3000 tons grossâ
17 knots and less than 18 knots 1.4 cents per gross ton.
18 knots and less than 19 knots 1.6 cents per gross ton.
19 knots or over 1.8 cents per gross ton.
Vessels over 8000 tons grossâ
20 knots and less than 21 knots 2 cents per gross ton.
21 knots or over 2.3 cents per gross ton.
Vessels over 10.000 gross tonsâ
22 knots and less than 23 knots 2.7 cents per gross ton.
23 knots and over ;?.2 cents per gross ton.
EXAMPLE 1.
A 5000 ton gross register steamship of seventeen knots, rating on a voy
age of 7200 miles outward and 7200 miles homeward, would receive as a
subsidy $18,030.
EXAMPLE 2.
A sailing vessel 2000 tons gross register, on Voyage from San Francisco
to Liverpool and return, total distance both ways by most direct course,
say 28,000 miles, would receive a subsidy of $8850.
FOREIGN BUILT VESSELS
Will obtain right to receive subsidies under following conditions:
Vessels actually owned by American citizens on December 1, 1898, and
those which have been contracted for in foreign shipyards, and for which
copies of the contracts have been filed with the Secretary of the Treasury
prior to February 1, 1899.
These vessels cannot engage in coastwise trade, or in trade from which
our navigation laws exclude vessels of foreign flag.
American owners before being granted a register for such vessels must
give penal bond for $50,000 that they will build in American shipyards
within five years a vessel or vessels of at least 50 per cent of the aggregate
gross tonnage of the foreign built vessel or vessels for which registry is
requested.
DEEP SEA FISHING VESSELS
Which are engaged in fishing for three months during twelve consecutive
months will receive a bounty of $2 per gross ton, provided not less than one
third of the crew are American citizens.
Each American member of the crew will receive a bounty of $1 per
month during the time of the voyage.
MISCELLANEOUS.
All vessels receiving subsidy must carry United States mails free.
At least one-fourth of the navigating crew must be American citizens.
One apprentice must bo carried for each 1000 gross tons register on all
vessels except deep-sea fishing vessels.
Tests for speed to be under supervision of a board of naval officers, and
must include not less than four hours' continuous steaming at sea in ordi
nary weather. *
Subsidies to continue for a term of twenty years, under contract made
between Secretary of the Treasury and owner of any vessel registered for
foreign trade.
All former acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this new shipping act
are repealed when the latter becomes a law.
The freneral opinion expressed in regard to the proposed bill is that it will
become a law early in the present session of Congress, and its effect will be
to work a revolution in the steamship trade of the Pacific Ocean. It is in
tended to supersede all present acts, and abolishes special appropriations for
mail service. Its provisions as regards subsidies are such that a premium is
placed on size and speed. As an example, taking the route between San
Francisco and Hongkong, via Yokohama: Under the new law the steamer
Peru, 3528 tons, 14 knots, would receive as subsidy $10,187 60 per voyage.
An 8000-ton 20-knot vessel would receive for the same voyage $32,880.
This illustration tells its own tale, and it is apparent at a glance that
within a short period the time across the Pacific Ocean will be shortened at
least four to five days, and the same statement applies to the Australian
colonies. It means that vessels below 5000 tons, 17 knots, for long voyages
cannot hold their own in competition, and therein lies the bright prospects
for San Francisco. Shortening the voyage, with magnificent ocean grey
hounds from the Orient and South Sea ports, will divert an immense
amount of travel from the Suez route to San Francisco. The service will be
more frequent.
There will have to be a general rehabilitation of the steamship service
as It now leaves San Francisco. The foreign steamships now being operated
by the Occidental and Oriental line will have to give way to American built
vessels as soon as the latter can be procured. It is In expectation of this that
C. P. Huntington is about to lay the keels of two immense steamships for
the China trade. The Oceanic Company will have to perform the service
without tho co-operation of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand,
and must find American tonnage either by charter or building to make up the
requisite number of steamships required for the service.
In general, the proposed law will create an immediate demand on our
shipyards and kindred industries that will have a most beneficial effect on
all lines of business, and under it San Francisco will become of still greater
Importance as a. shipping port.

SCHOOL DEPARTMENT
AFFAIRS INVOLVED
DIRECTORS FIND MATTERS IN A
STATE OF CHAOS.
Restraining Orders and Injunctions
Together With Acts of the Last
Board Place Them in
a Quandary.
What with restraining orders and in

in a quandary. Business of the board is
almost at a standstill, and will appa
rently remain so until such time as the
legal tangle in which the board finds it
self is unraveled.

cussed at some length the resolutions
presented at the meeting on Wednesday

of the department on lines more in keep

regime.

involved it, seemed for a time to grow.
They formulated no recommendations
and, in fact, did not see clearly their wav
out of the difficulties that bes"et their of
ficial path. There is a spirit of unrest
among the teachers, as many of them
believe the salaries for November and
December will never be paid, and there
is doubt when payment on other months
will be resumed. There is no probability
of the schools being closed, as has been
proposed at different times. The teach
ers 1 salaries are supposed to go on so
there would be nothing saved in the wav
of money while the children would reap
the penalties of the harvest that has been
The Directors express belief in their
ability to bring order out of this chaotic
condition and that all would be well
shortly. The case of a creditor suing the

City Finances.
POSTPONE PAYMENT OF BILLS
RETRENCHMENT PROVES TO Bi
THE ORDER OF THE DAY.
Over a Hundred Thousand iJollars in
Bills Contracted in Excess of the
One-Twelfth Act Go Over
Until June.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met twice yesterday for the
purpose if discussing the situation that
confronts the men who will govern the
city for the next twelve months. They
are between two fires, as they cannot
meet the obligations left them by the last
board and run the city on the dollar limit
as they pledged themselves to do. At the
same time they feel they cannot be nig
gardly in expenditures, as the claim will
be made that they are neglecting the
wants of the city and thus retarding its
development.
According to a report filed with the
committee by its expert, Mr. Williams,
the retiring board repeatedly violated the
one-twelfth act, thus creating a deficiency
for the past six months of $114,300. Accord
ing to the rate at which money had been
expended during that period it was esti
mated the deficiency at the end of the
next six months would be Increased by
$133,900. In view of the condition of the
city's finances it was decided to postpone
payment of bills totaJing over $112,000,
which are In excess of the allowance
made by the one-twelfth act, until the end
of the fiscal year in June. At that time
they can be paid out of the surplus fund.
Thirty-seven thousand dollars of the
amount is due for labor and material used
in the office of the Superintendent of
streets. Superintendent Ambrose exceeded
his allowance by that amount, which Is
included in the Inheritance of debt which
the old administration left the present
one.
In addition to these drains on the treas
ury, which the Supervisors find it impos
sible to guard against, there are extraor
dinary expenditures, such as the Botkin
trial, court orders and judgments, over
which they have no control. Under these
conditions it is difficult for them to keep
within the dollar limit. They affirm their
intention of endeavoring to do so, and ex
press the belief that they can when re
lieved of the deficiency in the funds cre
ated by the outgoing board.
In addition to the morning session the
committee, consisting of Dr. Perrault
(chairman), Attridge and Collins, held a
protracted session again in the afternoon.
I Various plans were discussed for reduc
ing the expenditures as much as possible.
The members seriously discussed the pro
posed new police station for the Mission
district.
At the meeting of the Health and Police
Committee in the morning it was agreed
to report in favor of readvertising for bids
in accordance with the modified plans.
Dr. Perrault questioned the need of a
$50,000 building, saying that $20,000 should
be sufficient. It was explained that in
addition to the police station there would
be a stable for the sixty horses used in
the patrol wagons of the department.
These horses are at present boarded out
at various stables, the city paying $25 a
month for their keep. It was finally sug
gested that the matter regarding the re
quired outlay be discussed shortly at a
conference between members of the
Finance, Building and Police committees.
The new Board of Supervisors is going
on record early in its official career as
not being friendly to boxing clubs. The
Health and Police Committee met yester
day and passed upon the request of the
National Club for permits for two box
ing bouts during the month of January.
The entire committee was present, con
sisting of Collins (chairman), Phelps, Att
! ridge, Heyer and Lackmann. From the
I views expressed by the members it was
' apparent that they do not look upon box
ing as one of the arts they should foster.
The committee finally decided to grant
one of the desired permits. This will
cover the meeting between Jeffries and
Kennedy during the last week of this
month. According to Supervisor Heyer,
if the fight should develop any evidences
of a job he will vote against granting any
permits hereafter.
Manager Groom was not altogether
happy over the outcome of his petition
to the board, and meeting Supervisor
Perrault was telling his grievances to him
regarding the fact that he had secured
but one of the two permits desired. He
received no consolation here, as he was
told that the board had not yet passed
upon the recommendation of the commit
tee and might not confirm its action. The
Supervisor said the chairman of a com
mittee was not the whole committee and
a committee was not the board, and inti
mated strongly that the permit would not
be granted when it came up for final ac
tion at the board meeting on Monday.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Alter the ex
; tremely bullish demonstrations with which last '
1 week's speculations closed it was expected
I that the opening of the new year would be
marked by strength of an equally decided
; kind. This was only partly realized this week,
; new records as to quotations having been made
| In many parts of the stock list, while the
, trading, particularly in the last two days, has
shown an activity fully up to the recent higher
i average. There was, however, some disappoint
i ment in Wall street, because when the Stock
Exchange opened after the three days' holiday ;
! a disposition to realize profits took place In
; stead of the expected large public buying de
mand. A sensitive money market In London,
resulting in a rather bearish attitude toward
American stocks there, contributed to the hesi- j
' tation, which made itself felt In the general I
i railway list here and which apparently caused j
some of the professional traders to temporarily
take the bear side. The easing off of quota
; tions on Tuesday and Wednesday throughout
the market was not at all severe, and in the
i face of it the coal stocks displayed consider
! able strength, while certain specialties, like
Federal Steel, Brooklyn Rapid Transit and Peo
ple's Gas, had effective support and made rapid '
advances. These movements continued Thurs
day, by which time the slight hardening of
call loan rates, due to the heavy January dis
bursements and changing of loans, had entirely
disappeared. It may oe noted that on last
, Tuesday New York bank clearings were the ;
, largest for any day in the history of the Clear
ing-house, and that notwithstanding this the !
: current rates for call money can hardly be
said to have advanced above 4 per cent, while i
time money was freely offered and was in as |
! little demand as ever. London, after suffering i
somewhat from another session of fears about '
j relations between Great Britain and France i
I and from the large calls which the season nat
urally brought on the Bank of England, main
tained Its favorable position toward Americans p
which was not Improved by the fact that on
Thursday $1,500,000 gold was taken there In the
open market for shipment to this slSe The !
, latter circumstance was counted here, however
j among the bullish influences of the moment ' I
; Some attention was also paid to the continued j
; good railroad earning reports, and in trans- l
portation circles stress Is laid on the general
and decided tendency of railroad managers to :
insst on the . collection of full tariff rates for :
freight, which, it is thought, may result In
a permanent restoration of char RÂ« to a pay
ing basis. At the same time the market was
more Interested in the manipulation of various
parts of the 1 St n and the position which leading
â  operators and financial interests are taking
1 as well as in various developments and deals
now sal a to be pending, which furnished a
c'e a Aa,n f Â°s r tocks. COntinUed UpWard movement of

' BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, Jan. Bradstreet's to-morrow !
will say: The situation is one of quiet, hub- i
â  tamed strength. In wholesale distributive '
trade annual Inventories have occupied atten- !
tion, and distribution In this branch Is. there
fore, of only seasonable proportions. ' Retail
trade reflects the quieting down of the eager
demand ruling before the holidays, but It Is
significant that the majority of the reports re
ceived since January 1, . in mis and in the
wholesale branch, refer to collections as al
most uniformly good. Export trade, particu
larly in cereals, continues well up to maximum
i figures, while reports from the new great In
| dustries of the country are favorable.
The cruder forms of Iron and steel - have
THE SAN FT^ A 1S 1 CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1899.
been in rather less demand this week at lead-
Ing centers, and large orders are few In num
ber, heavy consumers having pretty well cov
ered themselves for some weeks to come by
their liberal buying in December. In finished
ts. however, and particularly in steel,
rather more has evidently been doing, this
being reflected in advances at both the East
and West In the prices of steel rails, steel
beams, plates and sheets. Some heavy orders
for railroad account are reported booked, and
the export trade continues of liberal propor
tions, partly aided, no doubt, by the shading
In ocean freight rates occurring during the past
month.
Aside from the aggressive strength of steel
price quotations are little changed from a week
ago.
Bank clearings for the week reflect exception
ally heavy annual settlements. In a total nf
$1,765,900,000, nearly $40,000,000 larger than ever
before reported. 25 per cent larger than last
week: 24 per cent larger than in this week a
year ago; 54 per cent larger than in 1597; 70
per cent larger than in 1595 and 75 per cent
larger than In 1594.
Business failure are exceptionally small for
th" opening week of the new year, numbering
only 237. against 218 last week. 333 In this
week a year ago, 4SS in 1597; 446 in 1596 and
405 in 1895.
Thf steadiness of wheat this wwk, partici
pate.l in by other cereals, finds explanation in
continued foreign buying, the strength of the
statistical position, the normal time for de
creases In American stocks having arrived with
supplies still smaller than at any correspond
ing date for ten years past, aided by favorable
advices from Argentina, whence mintmum esti
mates are again arriving. The world's stock
of wheat on January l, a? shown by telegraph
ar.rt cable advices to Bradstroot's, gained only
9.700. 000 bushels over December 1. against a
gain of 25,000,000 bushels in November, and
European and American stocks combined on
January 1, 1899, aggregated only 118,949,000
bushels. 13,00<i. OfM) bushels smaller than January
1 last year, 37.000.0fi0 bushels smaller than on
January 1, 1897, 75,000.000 bushels smaller than
on January- 1, 1896, 5C. 000.000 bushels smaller
than on January 1, 1595, and 93.000,000 bushels
smaller than on January 1, 1594, when the
maximum of stocks In recent years was
reached.
Stocks In the United States east of the Rock
ies are the lightest held for eight years past,
and with the exception of IS9I are the smallest
held for fifteen years past.
The December total of bank clearings proved
a fitting conclusion to a year of unprecedented
expansion in many line?, in .an aggregate of
seventy-seven cities, of $7,335,551,222. a gain of
13.7 per cent over November's hitherto unap
pn ached total of 23.5 per cent over December,
1597, of 66. S per cent over December, 1896, of 71.2
. per rent iiver the same month of 1894 and of 22.7
per cent over the same period of 1892. This
latter pain, too, was shown in spite of the fact
that the stock clearing house at New York City
is estimated to have reduced the volume of
yearly clearings at that city by $3,000,000,000.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 0.560.26S bushels, against 6.292.
--f2" bushels last week, 3.4M.57fi bushels In the |
; corresponding week of IS9B. 3.105.65S bushels in
| 1597. 8,471,68] bushels in 1596 and 2,687.178 bush
! els in 1895. Since July 1 this year the exports
of wheat aggregate 128.355.977 bushels, against
132.44rt.jv4 bushels last year.
Business failures In the Dominion of Canada
number 28, against 16 last week. 48 in this week
a year ago, 65 In 1897 and 53 in 1596 and 1595.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW TORK, .Tan. Â«.â R. Q. Dun & Co.'s
; Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The year begins with the kind of business
demand that counts. For months there has
j been a rising demand for materials, but now
the crowding demand for finished products he
j gins to advance in the iron and steel industry
about one per cent without quotable changes
In pig except at the East. Beams have ad
vanced $2 per ton: angles, $1; bars, $1, and
plates strong, with an .Australian order for
I 32,000 tons refused at Chicago because the
I works are already overcrowded. Many thou
sand cars are covered by orders at Pittsburg,
10,0 0 tons bars are taken fur agricultral works '
at Chicago, 105,000 tons rails are taken by the
Pennsylvania company. The Midland Railway
Company of England has ordered twenty loco
; motives from the Baldwin works and many ;
other home and foiteign orders are reported. The j
demand has never been greated at the begin- I
nlnis' of the year than it Is now.
The wool manufacturer has a similar embar
rassment. While all Quotations of wool by
9 Urns, of Philadelphia average IS.<)3
j cents, against 20.71 h year ago, the market Is
<â  gradually yielding, because people appreciate
i the magnitude of stocks on hand, which the
! Boston Commercial Bulletin reports at 291,- j
l Of'O.OOfl pounds, an Incn-ase In its account of I
mnds f"r the year. Ohviously this
means a great movement from the farms to
i millers' Btocks and Eastern markets, but
' prices are not yet low enough to encourage the i
I large buying nr consumption by the manufac- !
, Hirers. The only heavyweight goods yet opened I
nr.' .a reduced prices, as has b^en expected, I
nml it in still uncertain how far the trade for !
. the coming season may prove satisfactory.
Cotton goods are in fair demand, with cotton
nt ." 67 cents, and while nobody 'an guarantee
| that the price will not lower, it Is believed by !
' competent observers that the market far goods ;
is BO far relieved of accumulated surplus that
prices are not likely to decline materially, even I
if cotton falls.
The wheat movement has to sustain it the I
largest foreign demand movement ever known I
for wheat and corn together, and the Atlantic
exports of r>. 214.42" bushel?, flour inemded. ,
against 2,840. 31.1 last year, with Pacific ex- |
ports of 614,631, against 572.44<> last year, would
give some reason to iintieljiate higher prices ;
won- not the Western receipts 4,001.532 bushels, |
against 2,876,072 for the same week last year.
The country is on the up grade, and the men I
whn expect it to take a downward road have !
v.'t some timÂ» to wait. There are no Indica
tions of a reaction which always follows a >
lario- and rapid business recovery, and exist- i
ing conditions in the industrials and in foreign
trade by no means forbid the hope that the >
increase may continue, as it did after the re- !
Viva! in I^7o, for several years. Kxports, com- I
pared with Imports, continue to Indicate an 1
enormous balance In cash due this country, and
gold imports begin again.
Failures for the week have been 243 In the ,
United States, against 322 last year, and 24 In
Canada, against 32 last year.

METALSâ The pronounced strength shown by
tin during the past ten days, more particularly
the last week, was Increased to-day by bullish
news from primary points, unquestionable cvi

moved up an additional 50 points, with the in

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 6.â Reports of damage to the
Argentine crop and unexpected strength at
Liverpool !n the face of a %c decline here yes
terday started wheat strong. May opened %@
M>c higher at 71%-5f71 I ,ic, and as calls had been j
sold very freely around 71V4C sellers of those j
privileges took fright, and In the endeavor to
procure wheat they expected to need for de
livery on calls May was bid up to 71%(g71^,c. I
Traders who had not sold calls were largely in j
the majority, however, and came into the pit
with more wheat than the shorts could absorb. !
Under this ardent selling the opening strength j
Quickly evaporated and the price of May drop
ped back to 70Vic. Liverpool was '/ 4 ci higher
and New York reported fifty boatloads sold for
export. The news and conditions of a bullish
nature had little Influence, however, and the
only matters to Impress the crowd were prob
abilities of Argentine and Russian shipments on
a large scale in the near future. There was
a dearth of outside trade and about the only !
support the market got on Its downward course j
came lrorn holders of put privileges. May had I
one ur two sickly rallies from "OVic and then I
took another plunge to %c below Its previous
lowest point, selling at 69=Si<g69%c, The market I
I became very heavy as the session advanced. |
| but toward the close some covering by shorts
caused a slieht reaction and May closed at
I 70<b7('Hc.
| corn started out strong with wheat and
traders for a time bought freely to cover short
sales. The trade lacked individuality and was
entirely of a local character. May closed 94c
I lower.
Oats were Influenced to quite an extent by
the weakness in wheat and corn, but were In
dependent enough to he the firmest of the
three. May closed unchanged.
The quantity of hogs received at the yards
w:k< responsible for a strong feeling In pro
visions early. Lluldatlon for outside account,
with the weakness In grains, was more than
the maaket could stand and prices declined

Harrison's circular says: "During the week ]
there have been three arrivals from Washington !
with 6000 tons of coal, three from Oregon, 1250
tons; one from British Columbia, 2300 tons;' one
from New York, 1963 tons; total, 11.513 tons.
The Jobbers and retailers report a brisk trade
this week, as the recent storm has materially
Increased the consumption of the hotels and
householders; in fact, the usual reserve of do
mestic grades has been largely eaten into. This
accounts for the long line of teams which are
strung out on the arrival of all vessels carry
ing house coals. Our supplies of Australian
and English household grades are almost nil,
as the high Inward freights from those sections
have almost prohibited their Importation. The I
deliveries here of English and Australian were 1
over 112.000 tons less in IS9B than the year
previous: this deficiency was almost entirely
made good by the Increase from British Co
lumbia of about 93,000 tons. There were also
sold here last year over 100.000 tons of Corral
Hollow and Rocky Mountain coal, principally
for house purposes.
"Our New Year's advent was a most aus
picious one. There never was a more welcome
storm In California; It was a far-reaching and
penetrating rainfall. A few more such, this j
and next month, will cause a. softening of coal
values, as inward charters for foreign vessels
would be made at lower rates than now prevail.
As yet no distinctive difference Is noticeable,
and tonnage Is very scarce for early loading at
all foreign points."

Major Long Tells Why Christmas
Gifts Did Not Get to Manila.
A story comes from Pittsburg to the
effect that boxes of Christmas goods
shipped to the soldiers at Manila on No
vember 1 never reached their destination,
but are stored in a warehouse in this city.
The statement is denied emphatically
by Quartermaster Long. He says that
all goods which arrived prior to the sail
ing of the St. Paul, on November IS, went
aboard that vessel. Every package, small
or large, was taken away. Since that
time, however, a number of packages r.d
dressed to soldiers have been received,
but as no vessel has sailed from that date
they are still stored in the warehouse.
The"y will be forwarded to Manila at the
earliest opportunity.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1899.
SPRANG A LEAK IN A SOUTHEASTER.
THE American ship Wachusett that put in here in distress last
Wednesday is in more trouble. She was leaking, but not badly,
so the underwriters ordered a windmill and an extra donkey en
gine put aboard, after whiob. Captain Davidson was to proceed on his
voyage. The men, however, had received an advance of $30 apiece at
Port Blakeley, only $10 of which they had earned, so they considered
the vessel unseaworthy and refused to go to sea in her. The Wachu
sett is now only leaking at the rate of three inches an hour.

TORPEDO BOAT DAVIS ARRIVES
DETAINED IN TILLAMOOK BY
A BREAKING BAR.
Ship Shenandoah on Fire Againâ A
Butcher From Geyserville Ar
rested for Felony i.m
bezzlemen...
The American ship Wachusett will pro
ceed on her way to Sydney. N. S. \\.>
without discharging her cargo of lum
ber or going on the drydock. The crew
is raising a howl over this fact, and the
chances are that ten new men will have
to be secured for the forecastle before
the ship can go to sea.
The Wachusett sailed from Port Blake
ley on December 23 for Sydney with
1 028 130 feet of lumber aboard. When ten
mile's south of Flattery a southeaster was
run into and the ship sprang a leak. The
pumps were kept going, but still the leak
took in water at the rate of six inches an
hour When Captain Davidson found
himself off the Golden Gate he put in
here for repairs. The underwriters looked
over the vessel and ordered another don
key engine and a windmill put aboard,
and this is now being done. With those
in working order the insurance people
consider the Wachusett perfectly safe for
the voyage, while the owners are so sat
isfied with her present condition that they
have not a cent of insurance on the hull.
Not so with the crew, however. The
sailors assert that the Wachusett is not
seaworthy, and that if they are com
pelled to go to sea in her they will be
taken in irons. When the men were
shipped in Port Blakeley they were given
a S3U advance for the voyage to Sydney.
They have worked out about $10 of that
sum and if they desert the ship now the
o^ers will be out about $200. it will,
therefore be seen that there is something
mure than the condition of the Wachu
s.-tt b.hind the seamen's desire to leave
her If they got away Irom her here
there H the chance of shipping over again
on another vessel and thus securing an
other $Â»' advance all Inside of twenty
Captain Chapman of the British ship
Lancing is also having trouble with his
crew The vessel arrived here on Decem
ber 2 from Swansea with a load of coal.
Nearly all the men who came out from
England deserted here, and when the- ship
was chartered to carry coal from Depar
ture Bay to this port a new crew had to
be shipped. These men at once began
making trouble. They objected to the
food, to the way in which it was prepared
and also to the way in which it was
served and lastly to the pots and pans
in which it was cooked. Captain Chap
man knew there could be no fault found
with the food, as it had been passed by
the Board of Trade, but in order to pre
serve peace on the ship he sent the third
mate ashore and procured an extra sup
ply of pots and pans. The Lancing goes
to sea to-day, and the captain is likely to
discover a few mpre idiocyncracies in his
crew before he gets back again.
The American ship Shenandoah was on
fire again yesterday. Luckily very little
damage was done. It will be remembered
that the vessel's cargo of coal was tin flre
several times, and after she was dis
charged the lining of the hold was found
to be considerably damaged. Carpenters
were at work repairing the vessel, and of
course a large quantity of shavings ac
cumulated in the forehold. Some one
dropped a match into these and the re
sult was a flare-up that gave everybody
on the ship a great scare. A bucket
brigade was formed and the flre was put
out in a few minutes.
The United States torpedo boat Davis
arrived from Astoria via Tillamook yes
terday. She was built at Portland, Or.,
for the United States Government and on
her trial trip made twenty-two and a half
knots an hour. While lying at the wharf
at Astoria one of the steam pipes burst
and several of the crew were scalded to
death. The Davis left the Columbia
River on December 24 In charge of Cap
tain Thomas Neal. Off Tillamook there
was every sign of a storm, so it was de
cided to put in there. Once in it was im
possible to get out again until last Thurs
day morning, when the bar was in con
dition to cross. Captain J. A. Richard
son took the torpedo boat out and In
company with Captain Neal brought her
to San Francisco. The run down was
made at the rate of from six to ten knots
an hour. No creater speed was attempt-
Ed on account of the weather. The Davis
proved herself to be a first-class sea boat.
From here she went to Mare Isfand and
will at once be turned over to the Govern
ment.
When the Davis left Tillamook the
steam schooner Coquille River was down
at the bar waiting a chance to get out.
She was scheduled to arrive here last
Monday and some uneasiness was felt
over her non-arrival. Captain Richardson
says the Coqullle River was to sail Thurs
day night, hut the chances were against
her getting out owing to the state of the
bar.
'â .iptain Brown of the Willie R. Hume
took command of the ship St. Nicholas
yesterday, succeeding Captain Grant, who
has decided to remain ashore for a time.
John Hanley of Geyserville was arrfst
ed at the ferries by Sergeant Tom Maho
oey on a chargo of felony embezzlement
yesterday. Hanley is a butcher and got
into trouble over the sale of some hogs.
HÂ«- left for this city with the money in
dispute and the Sheriff of Sonoma Coun
ty telegraphed to Chief of Police Lees to
have him arrested. He was locked up in
Harbor Police station and will be turned
over to the Sheriff on his arrival here to
day.
R. J. Bohue, a saloon-keeper at the cor
ner of Davis and Clay streets, had a tale
Of woe to tell Captain Dunlevy at the
Harbor police station yesterday. When he
left his place of business at 11 o'clock
Thursday night he had a bunch of keys
and $350 in gold coin in his trousers pock
et. He took a room at 80 Jackson street
and went to sleep. In the morning at
4:30 o'clock he saw a man leaving the
room with his trousers in his hand. He
raised an outcry, but the man got away.
The police .ir^ investigating the matter,
but so far h;tve found no trace of the
thief or the trousers.
THERE WILL BE
GOOD COURSING
PROSPECT OF A DAY'S SPORT AT
INGLESIDE.
Dogs That Are Well Matched Prom
ise a Lively and a Long
Stake Run.
Weather permitting there will assuredly
be a large and enthusiastic crowd at In
gleside Coursing Park to-day, and why
not?
Seldom have the patrons of the leash
seen such a brilliant card as that which
the Ingleside management has arranged
for the meeting- of to-day and to-morrow.
A glance at the coursing bill of fare
should certainly satisfy the most exact
ing leashman that unless something very
unforeseen sHoui i happen each race or
course should be close and exciting.
The drawing of last Thursday evening
was a success beyond a doubt, simply be
cause the high class dogsâ bread win
nersâby a peculiar stroke of good for
tune on the part of the gentlemen wno
handled the hat, were drawn to meet in
the slips in the run down of the big
stake.
Mr. Curtis of San Jose and other prom
inent coursing men who had strayed away
from the old to the new, have returned
to their first love and in future their dogs
will be seen flying- over the emerald car
pet of Ingleside Park.
Tom McHugh, the popular and obliging
field steward, says that if the leashmen
who own first-class dogs wfll continue to
i insist upon having their charges entered
: at each meeting something must be done
I in the way of starting the game at a very
1 early hour, otherwise it will be impossi
ble to finish the rundown in one day.
The park managers would also greatly
convenience the betting public by adding
! a few more pool-boxes to the number they
! are now running. .Last Sunday the bet
ting was so brisk that the people crowd
â  i cli other in their attempt to get
within arm range of the pool-sellers, who
were kept on the jump from the start to
the finish of the meeting taking in and
paying out coin.
Eighty dogs, the pick of the local ken
nels, will cut a dash this afternoon, and
any person who has a predilection for the
sport should certainly strain a point and
witness the rundown or this stupendous
stake, as it will certainly be an event
worth going a long distance to witness.
The big blackboard which" was recently
placed in full view of the spectators is
quite a feature of interest, as the names
of the dogs going to the slips and the
scores made by the runners appear on
the board immediately after each race
Other parks may possibly follow Ingle
slde's latest hitâ that is. provided tne
judges of coursing meetings can five
the points made in each course with
an accurate description of how the points
were made if asked to do so by any per
son who having dogs entered may 'desire
information on that score.
ST7ICIDE OF A CHINESE.
Chin Lum Became Despondent and
Hanged Himself to a Stairway.
Chin Lum, a Chinese cook, was found
hanging in the basement of the building
May Bring Leprosy to This Country.
It is pointed out that the United States sol
diers in Hawaii may contract leprosy there,
and bring it to this country when they return.
While leprosy is much to be dreaded, there
are a thousand times as many victims to stom
ach disorders and blood diseases, but there is
a cure for them in Hostetter's Stomach Bitters.
Other common ailments that the Bitters are a
specific for are malaria, fever and ague. Bold
at all drug stores.
at 754 Washington street at about 9
o'clock last night. The body was cold
and stiff, and evidently had been dead
for some hours. A suicide in Chinatown
is a very unusual occurrence. If Chinese
ever do become despondent, as a rule they
wait for the joss to take them in his own
way. Chin Lum was an exception, how
ever. He has been out of work for some
time. Two days ago he was seen alive
for the last time.
Last night Sergeant McManus was
prowling around in the cellars, and he
round the dead body of Chin Lum. It was
hanging to a stairway in the back cellar
of the building. The Chinaman had evi
dently attempted suicide by another
means, as an open knife lay on a table
near the body, and there was a small
wound in the throat. The body was taken
to the Morgue.
MTARLAND AND
MICHAEL MATCHED
TWO GREAT CYCLERS WILL
RACE HERE SOON.
Champion Eddie Bald Again in Cali
fornia â Association Meeting
To-Night.
The opening night of the big indoor
cycling tournament at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion on Saturday evening, February 11,
will witness one of the greatest match
races ever seen In California. Jimmy
Michael, "the Welsh wonder," champion
middle distance rider of the world, will
ride against Floyd McFarland of San
Jose, the champion short distance handi
cap rider of the world. The race will be
at fifteen miles, paced, each man to fur
nish his own pacing teams.
Michael and McFarland have met once
before, in a ten-mile match in the East,
Michael winning. The Welshman is ex
pected her in about two weeks, and Mc-
Farland, who is now at his home in San
Jose, will commence training for the event
at once.
Eddie Bald, who has been the champion
of the United States for short distances
ever since 1895. is again with us. Bald ar
rived in Southern California a few days
ago, In company with Tod Sloan, the
noted jockey, and they are now duck
hunting in the vicinity of Bakerstteld.
They will be in town in less than a week.
Bald has been here twice beforeâ in 1595
and 1896â but has never performed in San
Francisco, although he established sev
eral records at San Jose. He will ride
here this time, as he comes to contest in
the indoor tournament.
The contract for building the track in
the Pavilion upon which these great men
wil race here has been let' to Frank D.
Ellwell, who is experienced in cycle track
construction. It will be of boards, eight
laps to the mile, averaging sixteen feet in
width, and banked nine feet high on the
turns.
The six-day riders will leave New York
next Monday for this city, and should be
here about five or six days thereafter.
The middle and short distance men will
come with or follow them.
The board of Governors of the Associ
ated Cycling Clubs will meet to-night at
room 562, Parrott building. Some im
portant amendments to the constitution
will come up for discussion, and the pol
icy of the new president, Paul M. Nippi it,
will be outlined.
If rain does not again postpone it, the
Garden City Wheelmen will hold-their big
meet to-morrow at San Jose, which had to
be put off from New Year's day. The
rains having put the roads in a rather
muddy condition, the clubs from this city
will not go down awheel, but will take the
9 a. m. train from Third and Townsend
streets.

â¢ The Populists are not all dead. It Is
true : 'that a majority of themâ a large ma
jorityâhas become either Republican or
socialist, but there are enough left to
harbor an ambition that the party name
eh.ill appear on the city ticket.
A -mass meeting, at which there was
more mating than mass, was held, to
â¢which all those who wished to attend
were" welcome.
. As soon as . the meeting was called to
order a pall was thrown over the pro
cfcriinKS by the receipt of the resignation
of Chairman C. T. Johns, who resigned as
president of the Populist City Committee
come- time ago, and who has since boasted
that he was an ardent supporter of the
.Ifcep.Ubliean ticket last November. Judge
Lucas called the meeting to order and an
nounced that plans would be considered
to.be adopted by the party during the
tiamapig.n. L. Barkman, W. F. Bliss, Dr.
K. Hesse, J. Hennessey, A. Hoernisch, E.
.A.' Moody and Adna A. Dennison were
present. Following the resignation of the
chairman, Mr. Dennison resigned as com
xnittceman of the Fourth \\ ard, explain
ing -V nat his duties as a newspaper man
made it Inexpedient for him to take an
active part in the campaign.
â  ;, : Mr:- Hennessey called attention to the
fact that Populists, after having been
ejected- to office, were Populists no longer,
He referred to ex-Mayor Davie, Council
man '.'G-irard and others as examples of
the effect of office-holding upon Populists.
Ova-He's E. Gardner, another Populist of
fice-holder, now a Republican, was also
.mentioned,- while some one else called
attention to the fact that ex-Sheriff
"White and ex-Treasurer Sanford had not
Bhoicn such interest in Populism as they
diet, four years ago.
â r-lt \ya* iinally decided to form ward
clubs ' and stand on a strict party plat
form', which will probably include a plank
providing for selling the City Hall Park
sftev.buying another one and spending the
surplus in ' establishing a city water

ing when tbo dredging project ' was con- 1
Bidered. Colonel Edwards and others fa- :
vored putting a bulkhead on the outside >

tween Eighth and Twelfth streets is to
be filled in as soon as the Eighth-street

JUDGE SMITH
TURNS NURSE
IN THE COURT
Could Not Manage a
Witness* Baby.
KRUGER'S METHOD RECOILS
CONVICTED OF CONDUCTING A
SPEAK-EASY.
For a Long Time He Was a Police
Spy Paid to Secure Evidence
Against Other Law-
Breakers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 6.
Kruger Is an example of the evils Into
â¢which men may fall by association. Two
yean ngo he was a very reliable stool
pigeon for the Police Department. He was j
employed by Chief Lloyd to secure con
victions of people for selling liquor ille
gally at $20 per conviction. Kruger's
methods were not after a while quite so
satisfactory, and people came into court j
and said that Kruger had tried to act as
Judge and jury himself and to try the
lawbreakers on his own account. After
this Kruger's services were dispensed
with.
A few weeks ago License Inspector Ma
loon discovered that Kruger was running
a saloon without a license at Temeseal.*
He was arrested and to-day was on trial.
Many of his neighbors testified that he
Hold them steam beer, and Mrs. Nelson
told of much neighborhood gossip, which,
not bearing upon the case, was ignored
by the Judge.
Maloon put up a very strong case, show
ing that Kruger had for some time sup
plied all the steam his neighbors wanted.
Judge Mortimer Smith is a failure as a
nurse. Although the small father of n
large family he did not demonstrate to
the attorneys and lobby in the Police
Court that he is any better hand at pub
cluing a tumultuous baby than a bachelor
would be.
The Judge's attempt to act as nurse
was occasioned by the behavior of the in
fant brought into court by Mrs. Nelson,
who was a witness in the trial of A. C.
Kruger, charged with supplying Temes
ealians with liquor without having a li
cense. Mrs. Nelson marched on to the
stand armed with her two-year-old child,
and the youngster did all in his power to
prevent the mother's testimony from be
ing heard. The mother, however, was
equal to the occasion, but Prosecuting
Attorney Harry Melvin and modest Juilj:.-
Smith could not hope to make them>
heard, and finally the Judge undertunk
to look after the baby. He made a dire
failure of it, and after about three sec
onds and a half he requested Bailiff
Mitchell to see if there were not some la
dies hanging around the courtroom who
would relieve the court and the mother
temporarily of the responsibility.
The jury" found Kruger guilty, but rec
ommended him to the mercy of the court.
JOB-CHASING IS NOT
CONFINED TO ADULTS
JUVENILE SEXTET THAT CAME
TO GRIEF.
Rode the Brakebeams to Evade Fare
to the Capital and Landed
in Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway. Jan. 6.
The contagiousness of the Sacramento
i job-chasing fever is by no means con- i
i fined to the adept and adult politician, j
' but has broken out In virulent form
among the juvenile element in Oakland. :
Justice of the Peace James Larue of ;
i Brooklyn Township had lined up before ;
â  him to-day six boysâ Homer Marshall, ;
Jack Walker, George Colbath, H. Smith,
Frank Carter and Mike Moranâ aged from i
9 to 12 years, and all charged with trying '
I to beat the Southern Pacific Company by j
I riding the brakebeams to evade the pay- i
i ment of fares from Oakland to Sacra- |
â¢ mento.
j The boys were arrested near San Lean- !
1 dro last night by Constable Harry Cramer â 
! and his deputy, Jerry Quinlan, and spent '
I the night in jail. They admitted before I
' Justice Larue to-day that they were on \
th>ir way to Sacramento when arrested !
| and that "their purpose was "to see what
I the Legislature was doing and to try to '
I get a job."
Mrs. Carter, tho mother of one of the :
i lads, had already packed her Saratoga, |
: and expected to go to Sacramento to-day
to be near her boy, who seemed to be '
confident of sucess in his job-chasing pur- !
j suit.
The boys claimed that they had heard >
I there were always plenty of juvenile jobs j
! lying around loose during the session of :
' the Legislature. They had evidently never
' heard of the Belahaw law. that cut down ,
and relegated to the shades most of these i
i odd jobs, clerkships, etc.
Justice Larue had compassion on the '
young prisoners and discharged them.
I'arter. Moran and Marshall are the'
leaders of the soxtet. The latter is a
remarkably clover colored boy from New
York. He 'came to Oakland recently with
a theatrical troupe, which stranded and
j cast him out upon his own resources.
Moran is known among tho juvenile ele
ment aa "Fatty Marie." Some time ago
he and several other boys traveled to
Santa Rosa, ostensibly to work in the hop
fields. Instead, some of them played the
1 role of young hoboes, visiting a number of
'â  farmhouses and carrying off personal
I property. They were arrested for bur
' glary, and subsequently Moran's parents
: sued the county authorities for falsely
imprisoning their son.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1899.
WATER RATES
YET ON THE
UP GRADE
Forty-One Per Cent
of an Increase.
SCHEDULE PERHAPS VOID
NOT PASSED ACCORDING TO THE
STATUTE.
Water Question Will Be the Most
Important Issue in the
Coming City Cam
paign.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 6.
As the users of water appear at the
companies' offices to pay their bills they
are daily becoming more impressed with
the extent of the extortionate Woodward
schedule of rates. The latest raise is 41
per cent, and is a fair sample of the rest.
A year ago William Wehr of Piedmont
paid a dollar a month for his house. Last
December his bill was $1 85, yesterday his
January bill was found to be $2 75.
And yet President Dingee of one branch
i of the consolidation and J. H. Watkinson
| of the other branch have both declared
j that they are not charging anything like
I the rates permitted by Councilman Wood
| ward's ordinance.
There is considerable doubt as to the
legality of the manner in which the
Woodward ordinance was passed. The
law distinctly provides that the rate shall
be fixed after taking testimony from the
water companies regarding their original
cost, operating and maintenance expenses.
Last year this was not done. The water
companies did appear before the commit
tee and were closely questioned, but the
report of that committee was thrown
aside entirely and the Woodward ordi
nance was presented and passed without
any testimony being taken. At the time
of its passage City Attorney Dow gave it
as his best opinion, without making a spe
cial study of the case, that such an ordi
nance is not valid.
In the municipal campaign the water
question will be the most prominent Issue.
The raise in rates has been made at a
very good time to impress upon the voters
the enormity of the crime commuted last
March at the behest and at the expense
of the water companies.
WANT CHANGE OF NAME.
Temescal Signifies a Sweathouse and
Residents Seriously Object.
OAKLAND, Jan. Câ The citizens of
Temescal are in a flurry over the discov
ery that the name of this beautiful sub
urb means a "sweathouse," a place where
Digger Indians took sweat baths before
plunging into the river.
The executive committee of the North
ern Oakland Improvement Association has
taken the subject up, and last night reso
; lutions were passed to the effect tnat the
appellation of Temescal be changed to
some name more euphonious and more
appropriate to the present conditions and
! prospects of the locality.
The citizens are now invited to make
suggestions, to be sent in writing to "W. G.
Wallace, secretary of the association. A
committee, consisting of Professor Lera
mon. M. S. Dewing, R. J. Montgomery,
H. A. Ingalls, \Y. C. Wallace and L. N.
Hager, was appointed to draft a petition
and circulate the same for signatures,

A LIBRARY FIRE.
The Books of the Berkeley Free Read
ing-Room in Danger.
BERKELEY. Jan. 6.â Fire broke out
this morning In the new brick building
on the Shattuck estate occupied by the
Berkeley Free Public Library, and for a
while both the library and the Commer
cial Bank were in danger of being de
stroyed.
The blaze was discovered shortly before
11 o'clock by Librarian D. R. Moore, who
noticed smoke issuing from the three ra
diators which heat the reading room. Go
ing to the furnace In the basement below
he found the place on fire, and at once
turned in the alarm. The Columbia Com
pany responded immediately, followed by
the Alert, I'eralta and North Berkeley.
It was found that the flames were con
fined chiefly to the radiator pipes, and
that they were being carried over all
parts of the building. After extinguish
ing the fire In the basement the library
floor was torn up and the blaze was
brought under control. The damage done
to the books wn.Â« due entirely to the effect
of smoke; through the care exercised by
the firemen they were not touched by
either fire or water. As soon as the flames
were discovered the doors of the Commer
cial Bank were closed and all the books
and money put in the safety vault. The
bank resumed business as soon as the
danger had passed.
The damage Is estimated at $1000. The
library will be closed several days for re
pairs.
Alameda Pound in a Tangle.
ALAMEDA, Jan. G.â Alameda is without
I a public pound owing to tiie legal tangle
1 surrounding the ownership of the para
phernalia used by the late Poundmaster,
Vlctorlne Joseph, who died last month.
Alfred Ewlng was appointed Poundmaster
at the last meeting of the City Trustees.
When he went to take possession of the
Pound a son of the deceased Josephs was
in charge and refused to vacate the prem
ises. He is laboring under the idea that
he inherited his father's property without
will or an appeal to the probate court.
The buildings in dispute are on city prop
erty, with the exception of a barn, which
stands in the middle of Court street. The
Public Administrator may be asked to
take charge of the late Poundmaster's es
tate in order to straighten out the mud
dle.

DEWEY'S HEROES
RETURN HOME
ON THE NERO
Forty "Jackies" From
the Olympia Here.
WERE ALL IN THE BATTLE
i
FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY
ON THE FLAGSHIP.
The Convoy Experienced an Unevent
ful Voyage From Manila and
Made Better Time Than on
the Trip Out.
The United States ship Nero reached
port last evening, having on board forty
marines. All of these participated in the
battle on the Ist of May last, serving on
Dewey's flagship, the Olympia.
The Nero made the passage from Ma
nila in thirty-seven days, experiencing
a rather uneventful voyage. The time is
considered very good for the vessel, for
she is not very speedy. When the war
â  broke out the Nero was an English col
lier and was called the Westgate. She
was purchased by the Government and
after unloading a cargo of coal here was
I turned over to the United States. She
| acted as a convoy for the Monadnock
j when the latter was sent to Manila and
i made an unenviable record for herself
I in that she was not able to keep up with
the war vessel.
On the trip from Manila the Nero en
countered the tail end of a typhoon and
I a monsoon, but sustained no damage. The
I officers in charge of the ship are: Com
mander, Charles Belknap; lieutenantsâ
W. L. Howard, S. E. Woodworth, F. E.
I Swanstrom and F. R. Wall; assistant en
! gineersâ C. B. Forgham, R. M. Wilkins,
and J. L. Smith; and Assistant Surgeon
C. M. Burr. All of these were aboard the
ship when she went to Manila with the
exception of Lieutenant Howard, whowas
stationed on the Boston during the en
'â â  gagement with the Spanish fleet. The
Nero will go to Mare island to-day.
The "Jackies" aboard the Nero are all
i discharged, their time having expired,
! Most of them have svnved nearly Â» year
beyond the time which they originally
| enlisted. "At the outbreak of the war a
number of them were about to be dis
i charged, but knowing that there was a
j chance of seeing active service they re
; mained with their ship and. under com-
I mand of Dewey helped to win the vic
tory from the Spaniards.
The boys will be paid within the next
three or four weeks and have arranged
as soon as they secure their money to give
themselves a banquet and theater party.

Hebrew Services.
There were the regular Friday night
services at Congregation Emanu-El Syn
agogue on Sutter street last evening.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger preached a ser
mon on "Gratitude," and drew an inter
esting object lesson from the rainfall with
which the State is now being blessed.
"These golden drops," he said, "are mes
sages from God. Without Divine Provi
dence man would be helpless and could
accomplish nothing. What would the
farmer and the merchant do if the rain
did not fall? This shows their utter de
pendence on the Creator. Let the senti
ment of gratitude which pervades every
heart be translated into deeds of good
ness and kindness. Let these beneficial
raindrops be an incentive to that grati
tude to God who has been beneficent to
us."

Got Off Lightly.
James Wilson, alias "Deafy" Morris,
the "stall" for pickpockets, who was ar
rested at the Palace Hotel, December 23,
by Detective Silvey and made a slash
with a knife at the detective's throat
pleaded guilty to battery in Judge Tread
well's court yesterday and was sent to
the County Jail for five months. He was
originally charged with assault with a
deadly weapon.
It Had Its Effect.
Over on the West Side there is a queer
old darky, who is well known to a great
many peopleâ Andy by name.
He always acts as if he were very
drunk. Sometimes he really is, sometimes
he isn't; but at any rate he is continual
ly singing darky songs at the top of nis
voice, whether he be on the street or
off It.
j The other day as he was rolling down
I the street to his usual accompaniment a
I youngster of 4 years turned up i.is aris
-1 tocratic little nose from the safeguard of
a tall fence and remarked:
"Andy, you're a dreat bid fool!"
Andy stopped and was quiet for the
| space of a whole second: then grinned
cheerfully as he remarked:
"Heh, you youngster, if you call me a
i fool agin" I'll kick you up so high dat
i when you comes down yo' clothes'll be all
I out o' style."
The boy looked scared a moment, and
then, recovering, suddenly veiled out:
"I don't care if you doâ rd det a new
: suit then."â Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Hooley a Better Floater That Noah.
Apropos of this gentleman, here is a
riddle that is going the rounds of the
clubs:
"Who was even a greater financier than
Hooley? Noah, because he floated a big
company when the whole world was In
liquidation."â Paris Messenger.

REBELLION IN
THE BOARD OF
EDUCATION
The "Solid Seven" Seize All the
Patronage and the Absolute
Direction of Expenditures.
Efforts of the Minority to Wrest Control
From the Majority and Reorganize the
Board â Terms of a Compromise
That Was Not Accepted.
Mr. Head's Drastic
Measures.
While the Board of Education Is plan
ning revolutionary changes In the School
irtment and racking the mimls of
hundreds of school teachers with anxiety,
the honorable body is disturbed within it
self. The Directors are working only un
der a mask of harmony, and the struggle
fur control between the factions is not by
means over. As the situation stands
- Brandenstein, Eells, Staf
ford. Holbrook and Stow, flippantly
known as the "club flush," are hopelessly
cut "if from any share of the patronage
cr ,my direction or suggestion in the ex
penditure of public Bchool funds.
The "solid Beven" have seized absolute
ly all the fruits "f victory and have left
tin- minurity members to protest as vig
orously and ;is vainly as they please. Hol
â  brook has been hoodwinked with the
empty honor of the chairmanship of the
Finan.ce Committee, but he has as much
to do with a supervision of expenditures
as a janitor. The four important com
mittees of the board are completely out
pf the Jurisdiction of the minority. The
Committee on Supplies, which governs
t l>r- vast expenditure of money for the
irtment, and which is essentially the
most Important committee of the board,
is held 1 by the "solid. seven."
-.â¢â  The Committee on Buildings and
â :' Grounds, which has to do with contracts
and contractors, and which, in the past,

minority is fretting under the re-
Fl taint upon it. The members want some
thing more than the shell of power, as
tiny S( i k to work reforms more- thorough
ly- than (>y simply acting as a check upon
thy majority. Since the board went into
office several efforts have been made by
Ih'e- minority to overturn the organization
tied by the. majority. While a revo
lution was set in motion in the School
rtinent, a rebellion has been in prog
ress fii the School Hoard.
The members of the minority have stood
solidly' together since their term of office
rj". . They say that if they could cap
ture one member from the majority they
.! form a. deadlock and force terms
from the other side. If the minority could
two members they would then be
the majority and would organize
the board as they saw fit. The first over
tures of the minority were extended to
and for a time it seemed
as if success would crown the efforts of
. the "club flush." Cole wanted certain
as and a promise was 'given that
he would re eive them if he would desert
the majority.
- - He agreed to do so, and the deadlock
seemed to be a reality. So sure were the
"cluti flush" of their position that they
â¢ pffered to the other side the terms of a
â¢compromise that might be acceptable to
...both- sides. The terms of this agreement
that Director Stow should be elected
president of the board and the other side
Ehbuld name the committees, or ihat Ber-
Bhould be chosen president and the
"club flush" should name the committees.
All the while the. minority was holding
â  ye. The majority suspect
ed the play and threatened Cole with its
vengeance. He weakened, and his son,
1 I <;. Cole, was made assistant store
ier of the department. There may be
: no -association between the two incidents,
but the "club flush" collectively shakes
Its heads and the "solid seven" nods con
terite>l!y.
The minority tried again; this time, It
seemed, with a prospect of more success.
Director Gedge was the objective point of
attack, as he possessed more than one
vulnerable point. Dr. Gedge is a dentist,
â¢ -who has offices in tho same building with
I>r. Drucker, who was a member of the
last board. Gedge and Drucker are
friends.
In the general scheme of retrenchment
and reform Director Head has planned
two measures that beyond question merit
approval One is the abolition of most of
the special departments established by
the late board of unlamented memory.
The liapan board loaded the department
with their favorites in the form of
la] teachers of cooking, drawing,
pewing, stitching and what not. In the
general scheme of public school education
teachers and the departments they
!.teaoh are worthless, and Director Head
' â  has planned their abolition after the work
of. consolidation is over. Director Gedge
lias not tak^n kindly to the plan, and once
or twice was caught flirting with the
''I ;."plub flush."
Director Head also wishes to secure the
abolition 'if the Jackson Primary School,
an institution that was created for no
qther earthly reason than to provide a
place for Mrs. Elizabeth Butler, a sister
â¢ of Dr. Drueker. The Jackson Primary
School has not a single class in it that
reaches half the standard of attendance
established last Wednesday night. The
children attending the school belong to
the Dudley Stone School and to the
Honda School, and Director Head wishes
to send them where they belong by abol
ishing the Jackson Primary School and
removing an inexcusable extravagance.
To this plan Director Gedge also objects,
although there can be no question that
the school should be abolished.
The 'â¢club flush" heard of these disa
greements in the "solid seven" and smiled
approvingly upon Gedge. He has, how
ever, remained with the majority, and it
-'. %is believed that some deal has been made
Â° â¢\ to keep him firm. Overtures were also
â¢ made to Armstrong by the minority, but
the tight is not yet won. The minority is
not in despair, and it is determined that
if its members are to bear the responsi
bilities and criticisms of public officers
they must have some share in the conduct
of the public office they hold.
If they succeed In winning: over two
members of the majority they will revo
lutionize the organization of the board.
TJie committees as now formed will be en
tirely changed. The "club flush" stoutly
affirm that they seek none of the loaves
and fishes of political life, but demand
only that a conservative, business-like ad
ministration of the School Department
shall characterize the policy of the board.
If the scheme of the "club flush" suc
ceeds Stow will be president of the board
and Bergerot will come off his perch and
descend to the mediocrity of a desk on
the floor. Stafford would be chairman of
the elementary committee and would look
after the election of teachers. Holbrook
would remain where he is, as chairman
of the Finance Committee, as the posi
tion is harmless. Cole, or whoever fell
in to complete the combination, would be
given the chairmanship of the Committee
on Buildings and Grounds. The star com
mittee of them all, that now held by Di
rector Head, the Committee on Supplies,
would go to Director Armstrong.
It is evident that a revolution could be
worked in the School Board itself.
But the situation has not yet
assumed more than the dignity "of
a rebellion. The minority feels
that it is in a most anomalous position.
It believes that the consolidation of
teachers which has been ordered Is in
the direction of reform, but it fears that
the majority is only paving the way to
burden the department with favorites of
its own. The minority does not care to
realize Its fear that it will become a cats
paw and for that reason the fight for con
trol will continue.
SEARCH WARRANT CASE.
Peculiar Point Raised in the Contest
Between Dr. Williamson and
T. E. Strong.
A peculiar point was raised yesterday
by Attorney George Collins in a search
warrant case before Judge Mogan. The
case has been going on for months and is
not yet finished.
T. E. Strong is the defendant and Dr. G.
W. Williamson, dentist, the complainant.
While Strong- was employed by William
son he received a lot of instruments and
other articles as custodian, but after
ward claimed as owner. Williamson
claimed to be the owner, and as the arti
cles were taken away by Strong he ob
tained a search warrant, and in the com
plaint it is stated that the goods were on
the steamer Dauntless at Steuart-street
wharf, but in the warrant they were
alleged to be at 6 Eddy street, where they
were recovered.
( "o!lins argued yesterday that under sec
tion 1525 of the Penal Code the complaint
must state the "person, place and proper
ty to be searched," and as the complaint
gave the place as the steamer Dauntless
and the search warrant 6 Eddy street,
where they were actually found, there
fore the court had no jurisdiction, and
he asked that the proceedings be quashed.
The Judge overruled the motion, and Col
lins gave notice that he would apply for
a writ of prohibition to test the point.
Lincoln Relief Corps.
On the occasion of the last held meeting
of Lincoln Relief Corps No. 3. a reception
was tendered to Mrs. Edith M. Comstock,
the retiring president, who is to leave this
city for Shasta County, where her hus
band has taken up his residence. There
was a pleasing programme and an ad
dress commending the retiring officer,
who has been a faithful and hard working
officer and a true friend of the old sol
diers. The membership of Lincoln Post
was present, and C. J. Handley, the com
mander, had something nice to say about
the work performed by Mrs. Comstock.
There was a collation, and at its close all
wished the guest of the evening prosper
ity in her new home.
"Echoes From the Late War."
Despite the inclemency of the weather
there was a fair audience at the First En
glish Lutheran Church last night to listen
to a lecture by J. W. Erwin, president of
the California Camera Club. His subject
was "Echoes From the Late War With
Spain, and he illustrated it with some
very fine stereoptlcon views. Among those
shown were the California Volunteers, the
principal bauieships engaged in the At
lantic and Pacific waters, the naval offi
cers and the destruction of Spain's fleet
off Santiago. The lecture aroused the pa
triotic ardor of the audience and the lec
turer were greeted with great applause.
A Young Violinist.
Gerome Helmont, the famous boy vio
linist, who has been touring the country,
arrived from Portland yesterday morn
ing and is at the Palace. He is a hand
some young chap, modest and unassum
ing, and he was somewhat taken aback
by the number of prominent musicians
who assembled to meet him. He is the
favorite pupil of Musin, who declares
that the world has never known such a
wonder. He is accompanied by Miss
Grace Preston, the contralto, who toured
with Nordlca last season, and Miss Ida
Simmons, the noted pianiste.
Customs Receipts at Manila.
Deputy Surveyor of Port St. John is in
receipt, of a letter from "Wallace Evans in
which he states that the customs receipts
at Manila exceed $20,000 a day and are in
creasing rapidly. Wallace Evans is the
son of Captain John H. Evans, who was
sent by the United States Government to
take charge of the customs service In the
Philippines. He is his father's confiden
tial clerk.

KELLY KNOWN
AS A CLEVER
PICKPOCKET
Record of the Police
Court Clerk.
THE POLICE INDIGNANT
HIS PICTURE ADORNS THE
ROGUES' GALLERY.
Arrested on Several Occasions. He
Managed to Escape Conviction
Through His Potent
"Pull."
The police are incensed over the action
of the Supervisors in appointing Tom
Kelly clerk of Judge Graham's court.
Kelly, they say, is a well-known pick
pocket. He has been arrested on several
occasions for picking pockets, but through
his potent "pull" he has managed to es
cape conviction.
A short time ago he and a notorious
THOMAS KELLY, Police Court ClerK and Koown
as a PicKpocKet.
crook named Kins were arrested at Third
and Townsend Btreets while in the act
of picking a woman's pocket. They were
detained in the <"ity Prison for several
days, but were liberated on the woman's
refusing to swear to a complaint against
them.
The morning after he had been appoint
ed clerk of the Police Court Kelly visited
the City Prison and In an insolent man
ner demanded the list of prisoners whose
cases were assigned to Judge Graham's
court. It happened that a police officer
followed Kelly into the prison and the
desk sergeant, thinking that the present
clerk of Police Court 3 was under arrest,
proceeded to book him.
"Say, you don't know who I am," an
grily remarked Kelly when asked for the
name. "I am the feller wot' a been ap
pointed clerk in Judge Graham's court.
Are you next?"
After consulting the list of clerks the
desk sergeant was astonished to see Kel
ly's name among them. He was then
handed the list, of prisoners, and as he
walked away he vehemently declared that
! he would "h'x the guy" that tried to in
! jure him.
Kelly's picture Is to be found In the
Rogues' Gallery. When he was first ar
rested for picking pockets the police had
his "mug" photographed and placed It in
the gallery of crooks. For some unex
plained reason Detective Egan. whose
blundering methods in criminal cases
have on several occasions nearly cost him
his star, seems determined to shield Kel
ly. When asked yesterday if he knew
that Kelly's picture adorned the Rogues'
Gallery he feigned ignorance and refem d
the questioner to his superior officer. As
Egan had arrested the new Police Court
clerk on two occasions for picking pock
ets and was responsible for his picture
being taken by the police, his silly atti
tude in the matter Is amusing, to say
the least.
It is not unlikely that Kelly will be
an important witness in the Gallagher
murder case. The detectives who are
working on the case are convinced that
he was an eye-witness to the murder and
| assisted in trying to cover up the evi
dence of the bloody crime.

LEFT HOME
AND HUSBAND
FOR ANOTHER
H. N. Wilbur's Wife
Deserted Him.
SHE LED A DOUBLE LIFE
WHILE HE WAS AWAY SHE WENT
THE ROUNDS WITH A FRIEND.
It Is Believed That She Is in Los An
geles With Fred Walker and
the Husband Will Try
to Find Them.
When Henry N. Wilbur, a railway mall
clerk on the run from this city to Los
Angeles, arrived home last Monday even
ing he found a surprise of the most un
pleasant nature awaiting him. His wife
was gone, as was almost everything of
value about the house.
At first he thought a dastardly crime
had been committed, that his house had
been robbed and his wife murdered, and
was on the point of notifying the police
when he found a letter conveying the
heart-breaking news that his wife was
unfaithful to him arid had deserted him
for another. It read as follows:
Dear Henry: This letter will be a surprise
and a shock to you, I am sure. AVhen you are
reading it I will be far away, never to come
into your life again. Think kindly of me and
forgive me if I cause you pain, but you will
soon forget.
You have been a good, kind husband until
lately. The life we have been living will not
do for either of us. You can now get rid of
your debts and get on jour feet. You will not
have me to longer burden you.
I cannot write more. I have not told any
one of my plans or what I intend to do. No
one is to blame. I am only unhappy to cause
you any suffering, but I don't regret the step
I am taking. Farewell for ever. From your
wife. Loots. I am leaving San Francisco
never to return.
Inquiry among Wilbur's friends elicited
the information that Fred Walker, also a
clerk in the railway mail service, has for
the past year been a frequent visitor
at the Wilbur home at 1936 Ellis street,
and that he and Mrs. Wilbur were con
stant companions while the unsuspecting
husband was on his runs. Mrs. Wilbur,
when her husbajid was away, has been
addicted to gay company and soothing
beverages, although a model wife when
he was at home. He has never suspected
that there was anything wrong or that
Walker was anything but a mutual
friend of himself and his wife.
It has been learned that Mrs. Wilbur
went to Los Angeles lasl week, and her
husband will endeavor to find her there.
He promises to make things lively for
Walker when he finds him.

Chinese Society Seeks
an Injunction.
IT APPEALS TO THE COURTS
DKNTES THE ALLEGATIONS OF
THE POLICE.
Harbors No Highbinders or Hatchet
men, but Simply Teaches the
Young Chinese Mind to
Shoot.
The "Chinese Educational Society" <3Â«.
nies the allegation of Chief Lees, Lieu
tenant Esola and Detective Ed Gibson
that the organization is the harbor of
thugs and hatchetmen. It also seeks to
avoid having its headquarters smashed
by axes wielded by brawny policemen.
To disprove the allegations and to pre
vent the smashup the directors of the
society filed .suit yesterday to enjnin the
officials mentioned from further molesting
them or interfering with their property.
In the petition for an injunction it is set
forth that the society is duly incorporated
under the laws of the State for the sole
purpose of teaching the young Chinese
mind to shoot.
It is organized, It is averred, for the
purpose of instructing Chinese youth in
tiie English language, and for that pur
pose a Caucasian teacher has been em
ployed. No highbinders and none of thÂ«
lawless element are harbored in the estab
lishment, it is contended, but notwith
standing this fact the police threaten to
break in, without authority of law, and
chop, break, smash and tatter the fur
nishings and draperies. These furnishings
are valued at $1000, the Chinese claim,
ami if the police get in and commence
work they will be out just the value of
the property. For these reasons an in
junction is asked.
Notwithstanding the contention of the
Chinese the officers say that they are in
possession of sufficient proof to warrant
a raid on the establishment, and they will
prove to the court that the society is not
entitled to the relief asked.
WILL TRY FOR LIGHTS.
Mission Road Property-Owners Want
Their District Illuminated.
The Mission Road and Five-mile Im
provement Club, of which Dr. Emil To
rello is the president, will make another
attempt to obtain a little of the public
money for improvements in the district
west of College Hill. All appeals and
petitions heretofore sent to the Super
visors were referred to the committee
on "pigeon-holes," from which they were
never heard of afterward. A different fate
will, it is expected, be accorded petitions
from this portion of the city with the new
board. At all events Dr. Torello will en
deavor to have a building erected for the
housing of a chemical engine and a hose
cart in the neighborhood of China ave
nue. The necessity of an engine in this
section has been evident for a long time.
Another determined effort will be made
by the club to have electric lights ex
tended along' Crescent avenue from Mis
sion street to the San Bruno road, and in
other places where necessity exists for
them among the more thickly Inhabited
places. Following these a system of
street grading will be asked for.
This Week's Wasp.
This week's Wasp is one of the best is
sues of that paper ever published. It is in
bright colors, with the middle full page
half tone in three tints, the pages being
filled with sketches of humorous charac
ter. The budget of jokes and stories is
now and good. "Touchstone" in the the
atrical criticism passes pointed remarks
on "The Yellow Dwarf," and xh(+ immor
tals and fairies therein, and Teresa Doane
contributes some timely notes from the
events of New Year's In the social circle.
Rosenthal's visit receives comment from
R. A. Lucchesi, who renders tribute to
the genius of Paderewski's rival. Two
beautiful half-tone views from Manila
are in its pages, making the columns of
the Wasp as diversified and entertaining
in character as could be imagined.
