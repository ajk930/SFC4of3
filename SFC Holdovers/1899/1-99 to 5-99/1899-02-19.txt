PARIS, â  Feb. 18.â For once prophe-

right. Before luncheon this
?'J_* morning; at Versailles every
'â¢ .' . body said M. : Loubet- was 'certain
to be elected as successor to M. Felix â 
.Faure... In the afternoon he was made
.-.President of the* French republic by. a?
majority of seventy votes,' having re
ceived 483 out of a. possible 'B24. '-Hr.
* As a matter. ,of fact, .it did. not need
superhuman acuteness to come to the
.conclusion that an -â  almost unopposed
candidate might win . the Presidential
: battle.' M. Loubet. virtually had things.

RIOTERS CROWD THE

Phreaten a Demonstration Against
the President at the Funeral
of Faure.
! PARIS Feb. 18. â President Loubet arrived here from Versailles at â 
' 5:03 p. m. and was received with -military honors. Amid renewed accla- <3
> mations from the crowds the President proceeded to the Elysee Palace, Â§
âº in order to pay a tribute of respect to the remains of the late President* if,
| Faure.. A great crowd surrounded his carriage with cries of "Pana- Â£
â¢ma, Resign," and "Vive la armee." Â£>
J â¢ ' In opposition to the cite* of "Panama," the supporters of the Presi- S*
| dent raised shouts of "Vive Loubet." At this stage of the demonstra- S
5 tion a detachment of mounted curassiers appeared and cleared a pas- *
[ sage for the President's carriage. .Â»
I The noise was then redoubled and the police had great difficulty in O
' restraining the mob. Suddenly MM. de Roulede, Millevoye and Habert Â§
| appeared. : A:/."- â¢<Â£Â«Â£_ S5
I?:': M. Millevoye waved a tri-color flag above M. de Roulede, while the Â£
5 latter harangued the crowd. He said: "Listen now to what I was pre- Â£?
\\ vented from raying at the Versailles election. The President belongs Â§

I to the Elysee and spit upon one whom we. have no wish to recognize as Â§

live a republic of the people." , i .. - ?; S
The street demonstrations were renewed at midnight. The Republi- Â£

howled out in various ' keys. "Begin
with -Dreyfus," for the letter indicates
the alphabetical order in which the vot
ing is to begin.
Nor does the excitement calm down.
On the contrary, it becomes more in
tense, for almost immediately M. De
roulede's tall figure is seen approaching
the tribune. He mounts the steps and
then, instead of depositing his vote in
the urn, he turns toward the assembly.
His intention is' manifestly to address
the Deputies an^ Senators, but M.
Loubet is not presiding for the first
time. He rises to his feet and sternly
reminds M. Deroulede that he cannot
.speak when once voting has begun. M.
Deroulede turns to M. Loubet and
shouts out something, but what it was
it is impossible to hear. The uproar is
deafening.
"Vive la France!" "Vive la patrie!"
"Vive Deroulede!" "Vive la repub
lique!" rise together in a mighty swell
of clamor.V
M. Loubet's gong is ringing madly.
Ushers try to Induce M. Deroulede to
leave the tribune. He refuses with an
impatient j gesture. ) Again he turns to
the President of the Assembly; again
he thunders something, "wildly gesticu
lating. Then, as another effort is made
to get him onto the floor of the house,
again he puts \ his V hand to his hip
pocket. As a thrill of excitement ran

that shooting was go-ing to begin.

BULGARIA
IS LOST IN A
HURRICANE
One More Tale of Horror
Comes From the
Sea.
BREMEN, Feb. 18.â British steamer Koordistan,
Captain Simpson, from Savannah January 7, for this port,
has arrived here and reports that on February 5, in latitude
41 north and longitude 44 west, she sighted the Hamburg-
American line steamer Bulgaria, which was signaling that
she was in want of immediate assistance and sinking.
The British oil tank steamer Weehawken and another
steamer were standing by the Bulgaria at the time. The
steering gear of the latter was broken, and her rudder was
beating violently from side to side. The Bulgaria also had a
heavy list to port, her deck being level with the water on the
port side. Her port boats had been carried away.
The boats of the Koordistan vainly tried to reach the
Bulgaria, but were unable to do so owing to the heavy
weather prevailing. The Koordistan stood beside the dis
abled vessel for twenty-eight hours, but lost sight of her dur
ing a hurricane, which was accompanied by hail, on Feb
ruary 6. -
It was evident to those on board the Koordistan that
the machinery of the Bulgaria was disabled, but they added
that everything was quiet on board her and there was no
panic, while every one wore a lifebelt.

THREE BULLETS FIND THEIR

Los Angeles Attorney â  Canes v a Man
Who Dunned Him, and in
Return Receives Mortal
Wounds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 18.â E.
Hunter, one of the best known attor
neys of Los Angeles, a prominent soci
ety man and a leading member of the
California Club, was . fatally shot be
tween 4 and' s o'clock this afternoon
by William Alford. -The shooting: took
place in Hunter's office at 437 Stimson
I block.
A few weeks ago "William Alford. who
is a pattern maker in the employ of
Llewellyn Bros,,. obtained a small judg
ment against Hunter. It is not known
whether Alford was trying to collect
the judgment, but it is supposed he
went to Hunter's office for that pur
pose.
Hunter evidently became angry at
being dunned for the small amount and
attacked Alford with his big silver
headed mahogany cane, the head of
which weighs three pounds. With one
blow of the cane he felled Alford to the
floor. Quick as a flash Alford whipped
out his revolver and fired four shots at
Hunter, who was standing above him
in a threatening attitude. One of the
shots pierced Hunter's abdomen, in
flicting a fatal wound.
Hunter rushed from his room to es
cape any further 'shots that the now
frenzied man might tire. He fled across
the hallway to the office of Borden &
Carhardt and first met F. A. Stephen
son, who occupies an office with Bor
den & Carhardt. Hunter burst into
the room, followed closely by the en
raged Alford, who had murder in. his
heart and seemed determined to kill, if
possible, the unfortunate lawyer.
Stephenson took in the situation,
grabbed | Alford and took the. smoking
revolver from him. Alford was trying
his utmost to get a final shot at Hunter.
The shooting attracted the attention
of many persons in the building, who
rushed to see what had happened. Of
ficers took Alf on" Into custody. An
ambulance took. Hunter to the Califor
nia Hospital, where he is now resting.
There is little question that the trou
ble had arisen between Alford and,
Hunter about, the judgment. On the
floor of Hunter's office a pamphlet,
covered- by blood, , was found. It reads
as follows: -
i For saleâ A small judgment against Jay
E. : Hunter In Justice Morrison's court
room.
Alford was bleeding profusely . when â 
he reached the police station. Blood
oozed from a wound in his scalp, in- â 
flicted by Hunter's big mahogany cane. j
Alford was composed, and. when asked
for his statement calmly replied:
;;,''l: absolutely refuse to ; discuss the
matter." . -
? An operation has. been performed on
Hunter. The physicians tmu out* u_in_. I
pierced the abdomen below the navel, ;
one . entered above the right groin 'â¢ and
another' tore the flesh from the : left
thigh. The viscera was cut five times.

PACT BETWEEN REED
AND HUNTINGTON
It Is Asserted That the Speaker Has
Boasted He Will Kill All Ad
ministration Measures. yy.-
NEW YORK, Feb. IS.- A Washington
special to the Journal says: The explana
tion of the pact between Collls P. Hunt
ington and Speaker Thomas B. Reed,
whereby the latter is to kill the Nicar
agua canal project and in return Hunting
ton is to deliver 132 delegates to Reed in
the next Republican* national convention,
was read with much Interest In official
circles. Friends of the administration
who have hitherto decried to gossip re
garding Reed's efforts to pull down Mc-
Kinley and elevate himself admitted the
truth of the stories.
Reed, who of late has grown incautious,
declared at a recent dinner, according to
reliable Information, that he would kill
every administration bill coming before
him. He denounced expansion, army re
organization and the campaign in the
Philippines. While his views were gen
erally known, it was the first direct
threat he had made, and his familiars
bruited it about until It has come to ad
ministration ears. ' " â '
From now until Congress closes Reed
may be expected to fight every bill which
has* the executive indorsement. The ad
ministration Is to be harassed at every
turn with all the power and Influence
Which, as Czar of the House, he is able
to muster. In this way Speaker Reed
hopes' to convince his friend Huntington,
and through him the trusts, that their
salvation lies in his (Reed's.) political
elevation. y;^

I Brown, is the son of the late capitalist,
Mac Brown, and the wife belongs to the
old Button family, also prominent In the
social and commercial life of the town
! ship. The unhappy couple have been mar
i ried for seven years, and a little son. Al
| len, aged 5 years, Is the sole result of the
union. According to the wife, the first
I three years of the marriage were ideally
happy ones. Then the husband's love
began slowly but surely to wane and fre
quent business trips to this city were
found to be urgent and necessary. Mrs.
Brown declares she has no harsh feelings
toward the woman who has wrecked her
conjugal happiness, and only waxes wroth
when she tells how she "found the picture
of her little son in the room of her hus
band's mistress."
Mrs. Coad. on the other hand, has no
charitable feelings straying in the direc
tion of the lady from Petaluma. She
threatens to bring suit for damages and
to make Mrs. Brown prove every word
she may utter to her (Mrs. Coad's^ disad

* The fair amateur .singer's person and
manner plainly show that she is not a
woman to be trifled with. Though petite
and dainty, with winning manners and
pleasant smile, she has a way of setting
her teeth and knotting her brows, while
her black eyes flash , in '. a manner that
bodes all sorts of danger to the* one who
mlstaklnglycrosses the Coad path.
13 Mrs, Coad is about 25 years of age and
' has been wedded for more than seven
years to a man. who must be at least forty
years her senior. She wears the golden
badge of her plighted troth on her thumb,
and addresses her -lord and master as
"Duckle" and "Dear."
That, however, is as far as the outward
form of Juantta's affection goes. The

circumstance of her life during the past
four years. This the.lady regards as a
most 1 fortunate I circumstance and expects
with the aid of this precious document to
be able to refute any and all the charges
Mrs. Brown may bring against her.
Mrs. Coad spoke freely of her relations
with "Doc, Brown and expressed no sur

respondent in the divorce suit.

According to the diary Mrs. Coad- mcX
Brown on the 26th of June, 1597. She was
introduced to ' him by a mutual friend.
Miss Tillie Grundel. She continued to,
see /Brown almost daily and by the 14th
day of August Mrs. Coad. and Mr. Brown r
had planned the camping party' that is to'
j be one of the sensational -features of the
suit. .In those days Mrs. Coad was living
apart' from" her husband and made her
residence with her mother. Mrs. U. C. It.
Smith, -at 1186 Powell street.
"The camping party was the greatest
mistake of my career," said Mrs. Coad;
"and if it brings. me trouble frankly ad
rait that I deserve it all. 'Doc' Brown
had planned the party, which was to con
sist of four ladies and four gentlemen.
One by one the ladies dropped Out until
Miss Grundel and myself remained. Then
1. told 'Doc' it would be impossible for
me to go. 'Why. little girl.' .he said. 'I
will take as good care of you' "as though
your mother was along.' I was all pre
pared for the trip, and I hated to give it
up. So when my mother asked me if the
other ladies were going I told her an un
truth, and said that they were.
"We left for Camp Arena on August 14
and returned to town September 9. A*
week after our return 'Doc' was taken
ill. and as the club at which he was stop
ping afforded him no comforts I proposed
that he rent a room at my mother's home.
He came to live with us during the second
week in September and remained as â  a
roomer until July. 1898. During July I had
some trouble with my sister,, and : mv
father, siding with her. struck me. 'I.
therefore packed my things and .left
home." * .:'l'-, 'â¢ .-
It was during Mrs. Goad's absence from"
the family home that Mrs. Brown came
to town and found Mrs. Goad's picture
in her husband's overcoat pocket and her
little son's portrait in the room that had
been occupied by the fair Juanita.

for by Mrs. Coad; â¢ ' â  ** *--,-."â¢ v.'A^A-

gave my picture to him to keep for me.
As to the picture of his little boy, it hap-
I pened this way. One day 'Doc*!;, was- very
despondent and told me to take the pic

i ed him of home and all the misery there. *

"Doc" Brown began to exhibit a disre

began to make repeated trips to . the
city, staving away for days at a time. m

to appease the suspicions of . .Its.
Brown. The months dragged -on and

household bills kept pouring In on her -a.nd !

Â°Â° The -Grant people expect to gain four
votes next week, but. no surprise would
be manifested ' if they lost Merrill.
Nothing seems to disturb Grant. He is
surely, ihe most remarkable figure in
this struggle,. He can give Burns points
when it comes to coolness and uncon
cern when others are excited and anx
ious; Grant never has a harsh thing to
say of any 'man who leaves his camp.
He' assumes that good reasons for go
ing were shown, and that in due time
the- wanderer may return to the fold.
He is -not easily deceived either.
After Simpson of Pasadena had â  been,
1 at Grant's headquarters several times,
I stating positively that he was going to
? join the Grant' forces. Cutter believed
; the statements. Grant, however, was
j not so credulous, and expressed his
â  doubts as to the sincerity of the Sena
tor. Cutter instantly responded: "Do
; you think Senator Simpson would lie to
me?" Grant did not answer. He pre
; ferred to refer the matter to Simpson
and allow the Senator to answer for
himself. Cutter has the answer now.
Grant is fully advised of the efforts on
the part of the Candelaria agents to
break into his fold and during the past
week has acquired some information of
', an important character. Burns in his
. desperation is resorting to methods that
will produce a reaction.
Burns will make his biggest effort of
the campaign next week. There was
an arrangement with the Southern Pa
cific that he should show elements of
strength this week that would justify
a continuation of the railroad support
or retire in favor of some candidate
who would display winning qualities.
Dan has not made much of a showing.
He has gained only one vote, but he
has kept up such a boasting and shout
ing of what he can do next week that
Herrin will doubtless grant the exten
sion of time desired.
The people of California can hardly
comprehend the magnitude and far
reaching phases of the effort put for
ward this week to advance the cause
of Burns. All. the railroad newspapers
were lined up to shout in chorus that
a Senator should be elected without de
lay. Swarms of touts were brought
here to swell the permanent army \of
the "colonel's" followers.
The party organization displayed an
activity that would have commanded
attention in a Presidential campaign.
Promises were made to reward friends
and punish enemies. Every string, that
could be pulled,' every wire that could
be manipulated and every secret influ
ence possible to sway the judgment or
the legislators were used to boost the
colonel's candidacy, and the whole re
sult was the single gain of .Simpson's
vote.
i Profound quiet reigns in the Burns
camp to-night. The scene of activity,
as far as the touts are concerned,*, has
been transferred to San Francisco.
U. S. Grant went to the theater this
evening. It is given out to-night that
Assemblyman Merrill will not leave the
Grant forces as predicted, but will stay
to the finish.

set aside each year for permanent road
work, and . when an expenditure of. more

argued at length against the bill and to
night at times the debate was heated.

GOVERNOR ASKS
AUTHORITY TO
TRANSFER FUNDS
Peculiar Message to
the Legislature.
TO MEET STATE DEMANDS
EXISTING STATUTES GIVE HIM
FULL POWER TO ACT.
What He Wants Authorization to Do
Has Been* Done Every Year
and Almost Every
Month.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. Governor Gage sent
a message to j the Legislature _ to-day
asking for authorization to direct the
Controller to transfer $400,000 from
other funds to the general fund, to meet
a deficiency that will occur between
the end of the present fiscal year to
next. December, when the next install
ment of State taxes becomes available.
There is some speculation as to the
Governor's purpose in asking for this
authorization, as it is well known that
he has the power under existing stat
utes to transfer money from one fund
to another to meet temporary demands.
Having already warrant of law, it seems
unnecessary for him to ask for what he
already has. 'y/yAj- A . _Â£
"Under existing statutes," said Con
troller Colgan, to-night, "the Governor
has the power to direct' me to transfer
money from one fund to another. This
has been done and is being done every
year and almost every month."
The statute to which the Controller
referred is as follows:
CHAPTER CCCXLV.
An act to authorize the transfer to the
general fund of money in other funds
of the State Treasury, and the return
thereof to such funds.
(Approved March 21, 1872. , *;
The people of the State of California., rep
resented in Senate and Assembly, do en
act as follows:
Section 1. Whenever the general fund of
the State Treasury becomes exhausted
and there is money in other funds not
required to meet any accrued demands
against said funds, or demands to accrue
against said funds, the Controller shall
report the fact to the Governor and Treas
urer; and if the Governor and Treasurer
find that the money Is not needed in such
other funds, the Governor shall order the
Controller to direct the transfer thereof
to the general fund. All money so trans
ferred to the general fund shall be re
turned to the fund from which It was
transferred as soon as there Is sufficient
money in the general fund to return the
same. Nothing in this act shall be so
construed as to order or warrant the
transfer of any money from any fund so
as to In any manner interfere with the
object for which such fund was created.
Sec. 2. This act shall take effect imme
diately. - - :.*: **---;-:â " -
The balance in the general fund Feb
ruary 1, 1899, was $2,064,619 88. . V"-*

lative purposes, $25,000; for State print

: Deducting this , total from the sum of
$2,991,077 85, there remains .$370,878 91.
which would be the amount remaining
in the general fund on July 1. 1899.
The amount required to meet the or
dinary expenses of i: the State govern
ment for five months from July 1 to
November 30, 1899, may be placed at
$280,000 per month, or $1,400,000. De
ducting from this the sum of $370,888 91,
on hand July 1, and there will be the
usual deficiency of $1,029,181 09. r;~%
It' is to secure money to meet the de
mands on the State during the five
months beginning July 1 that it be
comes necessary to temporally trans
fer money to the general fund. In De
cember, when tax money is available,
this money will be returned to the
fund from which it was taken. â¢ -
Pursuant to the suggestion made by
Governor Gage in his message, the
Ways and Means Committee of the As
sembly introduced a bill which directs
the Controller to inform both* the execu
tive and Treasurer as soon as a defi
ciency appears in any jof the State
funds, and the Governor is authorized
to cause to be transferred money from
other funds to the one depleted, pro
viding that such money shall be re
placed as soon as the next settlements
are made. The Governor's message is
as follows: ; ,

\ I have the honor to call the attention
of your honorable body to the State Â»
finances. kv';*- l .!,Â»
The condition of the treasury is such
that if everything be paid which the gen
eral fund is chargeable with (even if not
a single dollar be appropriated by your
honorable body at this session of the Leg
islature) still at the end of this fiscal year
there will be the enormous deficiency in
the general fund of about $900,000.
I most respectfully direct your attention
to this condition of the finances, in order
to correct the delusive statements which
have been put abroad in reference to the
plethoric condition of our 'treasury; and
most respectfully urge upon you the great
necessity for economy, and that you make
only such appropriations as are of the
most urgent character; and such appro
priations should be made payable only,
so far as possible, on and after the Ist
day of January, 1900. at which time there
will be an additional Installment of State
taxes.
If there be transferred, at the proper
time, to the general fund from other
funds, $400,000, then, in view of the fact
that some of the existing demands may
not be presented. I think it safe to pro
ceed on the basis that, with the transfer
of $400,000. we will have sufficient money
with which to meet and manage our
financial liabilities until the incoming
taxes of January next.
I therefore respectfully request your
honorable body to pass an act directly au
thorizing the Governor, for and during
this year, when in his opinion the neces
sity arises, to order the Controller to di
rect the transfer of $400,000 from other
funds to the general fund: but this
amount so transferred shall be returned
to the fund or funds from which it be
transferred as soon as there Is sufficient
money in the general fund.
While I am decidedly opposed as a gen
eral pioposltion to this transfer of funds,
I am confronted by a condition, for which
this administration is In no way responsi
ble; and I trust that our finances may be
so managed under this administration as
to avoid a repetition of such a necessity.

NO SEWER SYSTEM
FOR FOLSOM PRISON
CALE HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. Besides vetoing the San
Francisco hospital bill to-day. Governor
Gage also put the seal of his official dis
approval on a bill that directly affects the
health of the people of Sacramento, name
ly. Assembly bill No. 2, which appropriates
$lt>.ooo for the construction of a sewerage
system at the State Prison at Folsom.
i Under the present condition the refuse
of the entire prison Is emptied into the
American River, and a few hours later is
pumped up by the city pumps here to
become a part of the city's water supply.
During last summer the condition became
so bad that residents of this city would
not use the city water for household pur
poses, and in Assembly bill 2, which was
Introduced by Johnson, they hoped to find
some relief. '
Mr. Gage's reasons for killing the bill
are included in the following message:
To the Assembly of the State of California:
I herewith return to your honorable body,
without my approval. Assembly bill No. 2, â  with
my objections thereto.'
This- bill provides for the Immediate appro
priation of the sum of $15,000, to be paid to the
State Board of Prison Directors, to be ex
pended by them, at * the Folsom State Prison,
in the construction of such a system a_ will
dispose of the sewage of the Folsom State
Prison without polluting tl.e waters of the
American â¢ River. While I am of the- opinion
that the purpose for which this very large sum
IS asked is a laudable one, I disapprove of the
present bill for the following reasons:
Firstâ The letting of the contract, the entire
work of construction and the determination of
the. amount â¢of the I items of expenditure, are
left to the Board of State Prison Directors,
without any check whatsoever, .â¢ the Board
of : Examiners being merely the agent of the
directors for the approval of the bills.
Secondâ is no limit to the amount for
which . the directors may contract in the con
struction of- such work. ; and - demands: may
hereafter, in â  consequence thereof, be made
upon the Legislature for deficiency appropria
tions. ," ,- . .' ' .... . -'-
- Thirdâ The money is appropriated! Immediate
ly out of the moneys of the general fund for
the present fiscal year. There is not sufficient
money in the general fund to Justify, this < ap
propriation Immediately, - nor to warrant any,
other special appropriation until January, 1900.

GAGE DENIES
SAN FRANCISCO
A NEW HOSPITAL
Vetoes the Bill Provid
ing for One. X
REASONS FOR HIS ACTION
THINKS THE NEW CHARTER
WILL GIVE AUTHORITY.
The Bill Offered by Sullivan Had
Passed Both Houses Without
the Least Opposition Erom
Any Quarter.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb Governor Gage has de
cided that the people of San Francisco
have no right to build a decent hospital
for the city and county's sick. He im
parted this information to the Legislature
in a message sent to both houses to-day,
announcing that he had vetoed Assembly
bill 243, and giving his reasons for so do
ing. -A AJ-A:'A:A^A A\yy..A
The bill was introduced by Assembly
man E. D. Sullivan early in the session
and experienced no difficulty in its pass
age through thÂ£ Legislature. It was ac
cepted as a request from the people of San
Francisco, who desUed to build a new hos
pital and could not do so without the
permission of the State. The Board of
Supervisors of that city decided to do the
work some months ago and proceeded as
far as having competitive plans drawn
before it discovered that without legisla
tive enactment It had no right to proceed.
The bill introduced by Assemblyman Sul
livan was designed to remedy this defect
In the law.
Governor Gage's message is self-explan
atory and reads as follows: -Ay A
Executive Department, State of California
SACRAMENTO, Feb. IT. 1899.
To the Assembly of the State of California:
I herewith return to your honorable body, with
out my approval, Assembly bill No. 243, with
my objections thereto. , '
This bill gives power to the common Coun
cil or other governing body of municipal cor
porations of the first class to erect and fur
nish, at the expense, of such corporations a
municipal hospital, and to levy and collect
an ad valorem property tax on all property,
real and personal, within the limits of such
municipal corporations, the limits of such ex
penditures being $300,000, and providing for the
levying of the tax tor such purpose in the
fifty-first fiscal year, and not otherwise.
It is apparent from the tenor of the bill
that the object in fixing the limit of expendi
ture at $300,000 was to avoid the effect of sec
tion 1, article XVI, of the State constitution,
which reads as follows: â¢*'â  ~a--:.
'â¢The Legislature shall not, in any man
ner, create any debt or debts, or liability or
liabilities, which shall singly or in the ag
gregate with any previous debts or liabilities,
exceed the sum or $300,000, except in case of
war to repel invasion or to suppress insurrec
tion, unless the same shall be authorized by
law or some single object or work to be dis
tinctly specified therein, which law shall pro
vide ways and means exclusive of loans, for
the payment of the Interest of such debt or
liability as it falls due, and also to pay and
discharge the principal of such debt or lia
bility within twenty years of the time of the
contracting thereof, and shall be lrrepealable
until the principal and interest thereon shall
be paid and discharged; but no such law shall
take effect until, .at a general election, it
shall have been submitted to the people and I
shall have received a majority of all the votes
cast for and against it at such election; and
all moneys raised by authority of such law
shall be applied only to the specific object
therein stated, or to the payment of the debt
thereby created, and such law shall be pub
lished in at least one newspaper in each
county, or city and county, if one be pub
lished therein, throughout the State, for three
months next preceding the election at which
It is submitted to the people. The Legisla
ture may at any time after the approval of
such law by the people, If no debts shall have
contracted in pursuance thereof, repeal the
same." ..Â» ..- * -
As the city and county of San Francisco is
in the first class it was undoubtedly the design
in requiring this tax levy to be made ln the
fifty-first .fiscal year to evade the provisions
of the new charter.
It was likewise the object of this bill, in
view of the proposed large expenditure, to es
cape the effect of section IS of article 11 of
the constitution, which reads as follows:
"No county," city, town, township, Board of
Education or school district shall Incur any
indebtedness or liability, in any manner,' or
for any purpose, exceeding in any year the
income and revenue provided for it for such
year without the assent of two-thirds of the
qualified electors thereof, voting at an election
to be held for that purpose, nor unless before
or at the time. of incurring such indebtedness
provision â  shall -be made for the collection of
an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest on
such indebtedness as it falls due, and also pro
vision to constitute a sinking fund for the pay
ment of the principal thereof on or before ma
turity, which shall not exceed forty years from
the time of contracting the same. Any indebt
edness or liability Incurred contrary to this
provision shall be void."
If these were not the objects, and if the bill
was not designed to apply to San Francisco
only. then the bill is wholly idle, because by
subdivision 34, section 64, article 3, of "An act
to provide for the organization. Incorporation
and government of municipal corporations"
(approved March 13, 1883), municipal corpora
tions of the first class already have the power
to establish a municipal hospital. Said sub
division reads as follows:.
"To establish and maintain an almshouse,
a city and county hospital, a smallpox hospi
tal and such other institutions of the same
character as are or may be necessary, and to
perpetuate such Institutions as may have been
heretofore established in such cities or cities
and counties heretofore incorporated."
Again, the power of taxation is vested in
municipal corporations as an essential at
tribute for all the purposes of existence, unless
â  Its exercise be in express terms prohibitedâ

TO REGULATE CHARGES
FOR TELEPHONE SERVICE
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. Senator Nutt is on
hand with another whack at the telephone
companies In the shape of a bill to regu
late telephone tolls.
In his measure he provides that r. *>
charge for a telephone shall be more than
$3 a month in full, and that there shall bo
no charges for switches, and there shall
be no nickel-ln-the-slot device attached,
and that where more than one telephone
is in use by the same person or firm the
price shall be reduced to $2 50 for each. Â»
The bill further provides that there
shall be "no additional charge for
switches in the same county, ' or where
the switch called for is within thirty miles
from the person calling for the switch..
For switches at a distance more than
thirty and less tham fifty miles the bill
allows a charge of .25 cents for the first
two minutes, this to be increased 5 cents,
for every twenty-five miles over .fifty,
providing, however, that no switch* shall
cost more than $1 for the first' two min
utes. There Is no provision . for conver

9 - CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, Feb. 18.â Ventura County Republican Central Committee
â¢ is taking a hand in the Senatorial fight. To-day Senator J. J. Boyce and Assemblyman Greenwell received . tele
â¢ grams from the secretary of the committee notifying them that the committee had held a meeting and adopted
II a resolution Instructing them to vote for Thomas R. Bard for United States Senator.
% The instructions came too late for Greenwell, for he had already transferred his vote from Grant to Bard,
Â© he having taken this action a few hours in advance of the receipt of the telegram from Ventura.
_Â» â  *' With Senator Boyce the case is different. He has his own ideas on the Senatorial question, and he is not
Â© timid about expressing them. He wired a reply to the secretary of the County Committee, and in it he made
$ known his belief that the action taken by the committee was prompted by Burns and the Southern Pacific
â¢ Company, and was for the purpose of scattering the forces of Mr. Grant. He left no room for doubt as to his
U opinion and gave the committee to understand that he would ignore its instructions. The telegram received by
j**. him is as follows: VENTURA. Cal.. Feb. 18, 1899.
9'â¢ Senator .1. J. Boyce, Sacramento: The County Central Committee requests you to vote for and use all honorable
pmeana to secure the election of Thomas R. Bard. Resolution mailed. J. H. MASON, Secretary.
|; â '- ' In reply to this Senator Boyce dispatched the following: SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. 18. 1899.
9. . . Republican County Central Committee, Ventura: You are Injuring the cause you falsely or ignorantly profess to pro
-9 mote. I take no orders from Dan Burns or the Southern Pacific Railroad, even through your agency. The Ventura
Â©"- County Republican Committee permitted me to be cut on the ticket when elected Senator by the loyalty of Santa Bar
â¢f-'bara County, and Ventura County appointees were rewarded by the Budd administration. Hence, I fall to see how
1 your request should have weight." 1 respect Thomas R. Bard too much to betray him. JOHN J. BOYCE.
8-' â¢'" ' -"Those are the men who fought me before my election," said Senator Boyce this evening, "and I'd like to.
Â©"know what right they have to dictate to me in any way. They knifed me before the election so hard that I ran
_Â»,'-a hundred and eighty behind my ticket in Ventura and if I had not run over three hundred ahead in my ' own
9. county 1 would not be here to vote for anybody.
â¢ ".â¢'.... "They are all railroad men down there and have been working for Burns right along. I have the highest
8 respect for Bard and there is a movement on foot to bring the southern men together for him, but I have no use
n -for these Ventura people. They are out for Burns and they hope to break into Grant's strength by bringing
Sb his men to Bard; but they won't stay there long. They will find themselves in the Burns camp as soon as they
Â©â¢'have helped to wreck Grant's chances. I have no use for the scheme and I think my telegram is plain enough
9. .; to make my position clear."
_t '''â 'â ' Bard has many friends among the southern representatives and they all speak of him in the highest terms.
J There has been no inkling so far that there was anything behind his sudden accession of popularity, but Sena
-0 tor Joyce's telegram may throw some light on the matter.
Â£ ' The Burns men are desperate. The end of the session is drawing near and all they have done since the
% .meteoric flight of Wright to find a home among them has been to befuddle poor old Simpson and then drag
9 him into the glare of their red lisht before he had come to himself again. But Simpson has been a horrible ex
-9 ample to his colleagues, though not any more so than the honorable Mr. Wright or the equally honorable Mr. Jll
' son. The winning of votes in singles is slow work and it is certain that there will be no more defections unless
\\ - the misguided ones should organize a little procession to brace each other up.
â¢ ' It is conceded that Bard may be able to show* some strength, but it will not be of the winning kind. It is
% -s^-.-^-prl here that he may be able to muster ten or fifteen votes, and it is even asserted that he may come to
9 Sacramento- to promote any boom that may be started for him. ' - : A-A- : a..
5' VENTURA, Feb. â The Republican Ccunty Committee met in open session this afternoon at the Town
' Hall for the purpose of considering the existing Senatorial contest. E. S. Hall, chairman of the Central Commit-
E tee, presided, and J. H. Mason acted as secretary. Practically all the committeemen were in attendance. The
a. question of the election of a United States Senator was freely discussed. The general opinion expressed was that
ft the State should be fully represented ln the United States Senate, and consequently the election of a Senator
ft should be demanded. After further discussion the following committee on resolutions was appointed: Messrs. T.
9 H. Merry chairman), J. S. Collins, C. H. McKevett, W. M. Ramsey and Orestes Orr. The committee soon reported
5 â  as* follows: -.:Â«.;.,;.,,
% Whereas, There exists at the present time a deadlock in the legislature of the State of California in the election

Washington street and Dunbar alley,
back of the Hall of Justiceâ the property
that was valued so high the city thought
it cheaper to let it go than to purchase it.
The hill provides that the property may
be condemned, and it sets forth the way
to go about it, and also limits the price
which may be paid on the condemnation, j
The measure is Senate bill 690 and is ;
entitled "An act to confer power upon
common councils, Boards of Supervisors
or other governing bodies of cities or cities
and counties of over 100,000 inhabitants to
acquire or condemn lands for a suitable
site and erect thereon a sultabie build
j ing or buildings for municipal purposes,
in addition to that acquired for buildings
erected or constructed, or in process of
erection or construction, under and by
virtue of the provisions of chapter
CCXVIII of the laws of 1895, approved
March 27, 1895."
The act says nothing about San Fran- |
cisco, but it goes on to allow the acquisi- i
tion of additional land adjoining any pub- |
lie building when it is found that the i
building is Inadequate and Insufficient for
the purposes for which it was erected, I
and for the proper accommodation of the j
offices and officers for which it was In- i
tended. It is provided that the Board
of Supervisors or other governing body
may, by resolution, declare its intention
of condemning the land or of acquiring
it by other means if that be possible, and
that it may levy a tax for the payment
of the price of the land, provided the
amount collected under the levy be not
more than {160,000.
The bill was Introduced at the request of
some of Ashe's constituents, among them
being the officers of the Kearny Street
i Improvement Club, who wrote to him on i
I behalf of the membership and upon their '
direction. They sent maps also and esti
mates and the tax levy they have 1 pro
vided for in the bill -is Just equal to the
estimates of what they figure the extra
piece of the Hall of Justice' property
should bring.
The estimates submitted to Senator
Ashe are: For the property itself, $65,- i
000; for the buildings to be erected upon
It. $80,000; for the fittings of the same
buildings, $15,000. making a total of $160,- i
900. It Is further represented that the I
city always contemplated the acquisition '
â¢of this property and the building was j
constructed with a view to Its final pur
chase or condemnation. The walls around j
the property sought to be acquired are I
built of the thickness of one brickâ prac- I
tically temporary affairsâ and in case the
propÂ«rty is secured it will be inexpensive
to teir them down and connect the new j
Bpaci on the main building according to
plan 3 that will harmonize with the archl
! teeturÂ«- of each fioor.
The property sought has a frontage of
90 feet 'on "Washington street, 53 feet 6
' inches on Dunbar alley and 34 feet 8
j inches ortÂ»a line parallel to Kearny street
i and at right angles to Washington.

THE SA^ If KA^GISeO CALL; ? Stiff PAY, FEBRUARY 19, - 1899.
of the Code Commission, Boyce had in
mind an advisory board to assist the
Legislature and to propose and revise
legislation. His bill provides that the
Code Commission should be a permanent
body, Its members to devote their entire
time to the work and to receive and act
! on suggestions and needed reforms in the
I laws between sessions of the Legislature,
iso that when the next session comes
around the commission would have the
proper remedial act ready and In condi
tion to be passed upon by the legislators.
It was also provided that during the ses
sions of the Legislature the commission
should stand ready to Investigate and
'.revise bills submitted, or to be submitted,
and suggest changes that the Information
of the public needs showed. were advisa
ble. It was also made the duty of the
commission to notify the persons affected
when any legislation was under consid
j eration, and to hear arguments, oral or
j written, for or against the measure. In
order that the commission might amend
it to do justice to all parties. It was as
close to the referendum as was possible.
The bill was referred to a. sub-commit
tee, consisting of Boyce, Dickinson, Bulla,
| Davis and Taylor. It has been under con
sideration for some time and is being
stripped by amendment of many of its
principal features. The clause requiring
the undivided attention of the members
of the commission was objected to. The
clause excluding public officers and leg
islators from those eligible to appoint
ment met with no favor, the tenure of of
fice was not to the Idea of the majority
of the sub-committee, and that part of
the bill making the commission an ad
visory board to the Legislature was In
' peril of total elimination.
The committee is not yet through with
I the bill, and Senator Boyce began to
i think there was no chance for his scheme
of revision, so he declared he would have
his bill go through with some of its good
points remaining, or he would Introduce
a bill to wipe the commission out of ex-
I istence. He Introduced a bill to-day. It
' simply provides that the act creating the
I Code Commission, "is hereby repealed."
! and the fight is on. , Boyce's contention
' is that the Code. Commission, as at pres
; ent created. Is a useless incumbrance and
I an institution that falls far short of what
|It might accomplish. His bill aimed to
, make it a body In perpetual session,
! where people could come with their griev
; ances, and when the Legislature met the
| commission would be able to propose
, something definite and not compel the leg
islators to go groping about In the dark
<â  for sixty days every second year. -
"I want to better that commission and
make it something," says the Senator;
i "but if they won't let me, they can have
! the other alternative. If they don't want
' to be better, let them go out of existence
| altogether." . -.:â¢:;- ,;v";y *
SACRAMENTO COUNTY
RECEIVES A SETBACK
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 18.â Sacramento was given
something in the nature of a body blow
by the Senate to-day. It was during the
discussion of Senator Doty's bill provid
ing for the repayment to the â¢ county " of
Sacramento of money the county put Into
the State Fair. The present fair grounds
â¢ are rapidly being surrounded by the grow
ing city of Sacramento, and: it has been?
found necessary to sell the property. It
â¢was purchased In. the , first place wltii
money raised by a tax levy in Sacramento
County, and : now the Sacramentans are
trying to get that money/back.' Two
years ago a bill was passed providing for .
the sale of the property, and this year
practically the same .bill was Introduced,
but with this additional provisionâ
If within a year after the sale the fair is
not re-established in Sacramento County,
then there is to be paid Sacramento Coun
ty the difference between the price of the
property and the debts upon it. It will
sell for about $100,000, and. there are debts
amounting* to $50,000.
Senator Doty said the idea was that the
county-should be repaid- If the fair were
established anywhere else, but if it were
again located in Sacramento County, all
would be satisfactory. He declared the
measure was one for the protection of the
county In case the fair were removed.
But the Senate would not look at it
that way. It was pointed out that the
county had raised the original money,
$53,000, willingly and with a view to secur
ing the advantages arising from the pres
ence of the fair, and that it had reaped
much more than had been sown. It was
proposed to amend the bill so as to order
the money paid into the State Treasury
for the benefit of the State.
This was not what Senator Doty or his
constituents wanted. Under the act of
two years ago the money goes into the
State Treasury, but there is nothing to
prevent Sacramento from taking a try at
It anyway through the courts.
But In trying to make it certain for the
county, the promoters of the scheme met
something which put it out of their way
altogether and they objected. The amend
ment passed, however, and the bill was
laid over for amendment, despite Senator
Doty's statement that they would sooner
have the old law than the pending bill
with its amendment.
SENATORS ANXIOUS ;
ABOUT ADJOURNMENT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 18.â The Senate is getting
apprehensive of the day for final adjourn
ment, and a resolution to the effect that
the body finally adjourn on March 4, with
out fail or postponment, has been sub
mitted by Senator Curtln, and ls now in
the hands of the committee on rules.
A message from the Governor, breath
ing words of frugality and legislative
economy, was read during the morning
session and was listened to with an in
terest second only . to the attention paid
the chaplain'^ prayer. The Rev. Mr.
Sturtevant has been drawn Into the Sen
atorial contest so far as to pray that the
vexing problem of the deadlock be speed
ily and effectually, broken, and that then
the man upon whom shall fall the honor
of entering the halls of the United States
Senate for California shall be pure and
of high motives and fit for the duties and
responsibilities that shall be thrust upon
him, and that he shall so comport himself
as to be commendable in the sight of the
Lord. It is plain that the Rev. Mr. Stur
tevant is not a Burns man.
The Assembly sent in a message to the
effect that it would not accept the amend
ment the Senate had seen fit to tack on
to the bill regulating the practicing of
horeshoelng as a fine art. The bill |as
originally conceived by Assemblyman
Cobb and passed by the Assembly provid
ed that the act should affect only counties
of over 35,000 inhabitants, and the Sen
ate struck this out so as to make it re
fer to the whole State. But the Assembly
would not stand the raise, and so a com
mittee of Senators Taylor, Leavitt
and Prlskâ was appointed to confer with
a similar committee from the Assembly
to find some way out of the difficulty.
The Committee on Health and Hospit
als reported unfavorably on Hall s bill to
prohibit the maintaining of a crematory
within any city limits or within two miles
of the place. Â, ,
Maggard introduced a bill providing for
the appointment of a State quarantine
officer, under the direction and control or

and now the Federal Government will not

private property. The channel has be-
Some' shallow since the building of the

mission was first formed there were but
â¢xty banks In the state, while now there
are over two hundred. Then, too, since
th, recent failure of the bank in San Jose
the commission has ordered that all
transfers of property be at once reported,
and "this has added more work than three
commissioners can properly^attend to. In
view of these facts Senator Wolfe submit
ted the bill raising the number of com
missioners, but for economy's sake cut
ting down their salaries.
The bill creates a new board^which, of
course, provides for the extinction of the
old one, and this is the Principal reason
for the change. If the old board is abol
ished the new one must' be appointed by
the Governor, and he will have the scalps
of the present Commissionersâ Barney
Murphy. ex-Adjutant General A. W. Bar
rett and John Markleyâ hanging at his
belt. They are all good Democrats, and
the Governor wants their places for his
own men. He cannot get the places un
less by some such course as he has adopt
ed and therefore the bill was introduced.'
LANGFORD WANTS THE
STATE TO PAY THE BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. There is now pending
before the Finance Committee one of the
most peculiar pieces of legislation that
has come before the Senate this session.
It Ik a bill introduced by a Senator,
which, If passed, will save him some
thousands of dollars. A'- a'-
The bill appropriates $7479 04 to pay the
claim of Louis Gerlach, and was submit
ted by Senator Langford. The claim is
for deficiency in the District Fair ac
counts in the "Second Agricultural Dis
trict. Gerlach was a director of the fair,
and so was Langford, and when it came
time to pay up Gerlach had to draw his
note for the $7000. Senator Langford was
one of the 'lndorsers on the note. It was
a bad year for district fairs, and among
them all they came out over $200,000 be
hind This amount was made the* sub
ject of an appropriation 'dill two years
ago which- passed both houses, but was
killed by Governor Budd, who refused to
sign It. â¢ The bill introduced by. Senator
Langford' is one way of escaping from
the obligations of the note. Should, the
bill pass, the State will pay the claim,
the note will be: canceled. and the indors
ers will not have to pay. Should the bill
fall of pasage, however, the Indorsers will
have to pay up. -
Senator Langford sees nothing peculiar
in bis position. He says It is a State
debt, not - a personal one. i

FINDS ALL-AMERICAN ROUTE
THE PARTY HAS A TERRIBLE
EXPERIENCE.
â  -
After the Pack Mules Are Killed and
Eaten the Explorers Are Com

Berries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 18â Lieutenant Cast
ner of the United States army has arrived
in Dawson after traveling over 2400 miles
on foot through the unexplored and un
known Interior of Alaska, Castner and
two other lieutenants started last
spring from the southern coast of Alaska
for the purpose of finding, if possible, an
ail-American trail to , the | Interior.
The party had not gone far when It
was found that it would have to spearate.
Castner and two soldiers, with five pack
mules, started ahead, the others going
back. It was weeks before Castner re
alized that all maps of the interior of
Alaska were wrong. He was hemmed in
with ice and snow, and to go back was
as bad as to go ahead. The provisions
gave out and one by one the pack mules
were killed and eaten. Finally, without
shoes or moccasins, the party of three
reached the Tanana River, although not
recognizing it. .?;;?;â¢-
With feet tied up in canvas and living
on berries the party started to raft down
the river, let It lead where' it would. Bad
luck followed them, and their raft was
destroyed, their guns and axes going to
the bottom. A coll of rope was saved,
and with this another raft was made and
the journey continued.
On the river was an encampment of
Indians, who rescued Castner and his
companions and put them on the trail to
the Yukon, which they reached in safety.
Lieutenant Castner says a good â  ail-
American trail can be made from the
southern coast to the interior, and is
ready to lead the way. He prospected
little, but found gold, silver and o*al along
the route. The lieutenant and compan
ions were literally skin and bones when
they reached civilization, but all have re
covered from the exposure and hardships.
They were -.or more than eight months
alone in the solitudes of snow and Ice
In the interior of Alaska. The party
blazed the trail they followed, so it can
be retraveled and made an American
highway. ______^______

HER PICTURES
IN HIS OVERCOAT
POCKET
Continued from First Page.
worldâ man," said Mrs. Brown when
interviewed by a Call reporter at J her
home in Petaluma yesterday.
"When I married Mr. Brown I
thought he was a man endowed with
the higher instincts of human love. We
lived happily together for several years.
Then he began to neglect me. I did not
feel the pangs of jealousy. My nature
is too proud for that. I felt that he
himself crushed out the love I bore him,
and he alone would some day live to
regret it. hen we were married we
went to live in a cottage adjoining the
home of his family. Things went on
nicely, but after a time my husband
began to neglect me. He never gave
me any money and we lived very fru
gally. He never allowed me to get an
inkling to his financial affairs, but I
cared little for this. It was none of
my business as long as he was willing
to support me properly. But this he
did not do. Everything we got was
bought on credit and bills were con
stantly pourin**** in, which he showed lit
tle disposition to settle. I became sad
dened by this state of affairs. I had not
been brought up to live on others, but
I said nothing until he began to make
extended trips to the city.
"In August of '97 my husband left
Petaluma and told me he was going
into the country for a hunting trip. He
promised to write to me every day, but
was gone fully six weeks and did not
Write a line. I went to the city and
found out that he was camping with
some of his friends and was accompa
nied by Juanita Coad. When he re
turned he did not come back to Peta
luma. He was a coward at heart, and
probably thought that I bore him ill
will. I did not, however; neither did
I cherish any ' revengeful thoughts
against the Coad woman. His actions
simply killed my love for him, and with
its dying no thoughts of jealousy
kindled within me.
"I had my regrets, of course, and the
thoughts of teaching my boy to love a
father who was not a man gave a tinge
of sorrow' to them. His sisters and
mother, who have always shown the
greatest interest in my welfare, were
kind to me in my misfortune, and they
did all they could to affect a reconcilia
tion between us. If Mr. Brown had a
character like the rest of his family
our affairs would never be aired in the
courts of divorce.
"When I found that he was consort
ing with the Coad woman I went to the
city and visited their house on Powell
street. I was admitted to the house,
and on searching her room I found the
picture of my husband in the pocket of
her dress. On the walls of her room
hung the picture of my baby boy. The
face of little Allan decorating the walls
of my husband's mistress, , was too xtitiqh
for me to. bear, so I returned to Peta
luma and decided to* sue for divorce. .
I have filed a complaint alleging ifffl- â 
delity, cruelty, failure to. provide .and -
desertion, and I can prove a case on â¢
each and every one of these grounds* :
"The â¢â  case is set for -the 23d of -this".,
month. I was in hopes that the papers- â¢
would not get hold of this affair. For...
the sake of all parties concerned we.-,
have striven to keep the matter a se- :
cret, but now that it is out the story,
may just as well be told; . :
"My husband is not in the State- at.
present, and if his representatives plefcd.
for more time I am willing to grant'
their wishes. I do not care to make,
war on the absent, especially when he is*
an invalid. His lawyers have promised* '
repeatedly to have him file his answer,- '
but he has never done so. I believe he- .
is much of a coward to come here?
and face these charges. .* - - '^''
"Before Mr. Brown left Petaluma the
last time he mortgaged some property
for three thousand or thirty-flve hun
dred dollars and did not give* a cent of
the money to me. After being gone â¢
nearly a year he returned and offered,
to give me $10 simply to be able to go
on the stand and swear, in case I sued
for divorce, that he had provided for
me within a year. -
"I have sued for the divorce on the
ground of infidelity, for the â¢ reason
that I want everybody to understand,
my reasons for asking for a separation.
I am strongly opposed to divorces and
would be willing to put up with almost
anything but infidelity, A man who is
unfaithful to his wife is Indeed a low
creature. I have passed through a bit
ter experience, but I take solace in the
thought that my cup of future exis
tence may be all the sweeter for it.
"For the sake of Mr. Brown s family
I regret that I had to bring this suit.
They are kind-hearted people and have
always felt for me in my trouble. â¢ I
have not the slightest animosity toward
Mrs. Coad. I cannot blame her; the
brunt must be borne by my husband. â¢
"I am not prepared to say just what
Mr. Brown did with his money. I know,
however, that he spent much of it with
Mrs. Coad and the circle of so-called
friends with whom he associated.'

MAI WEBBER THE
BRIDE OF PLUNGER
CHARLES F. DWYER
Romance Begun in San Francisco
; Ends in a Wedding at
Milwaukee.
.'â¢'CHICAGO, Feb. 18.â Despite the 2000
-.miles Which separated them and a score
â¢of interfering relatives and' friends,
Miss Lois Mai Webber, daughter of the
â¢â¢lat.e Captain John Webber of Oakland,
Cad., succeeded, to-day in reaching her
â 'â  fiance -and becoming the wife. of
Charles F. Dwyer, a son of Michael F.
Dwyer, the famous turfman, and him
self . famous on two continents as a
plunger in the betting ring. j\
* This is the brief synopsis of a fast
and furious romance that has covered
"a. space of six weeks, stretched from
coast" to coast, involved a half-dozen
well known names and finally united
â 'the young girl from San Francisco to
a -scion of one of the foremost turf fol
lowing families of the world.
With newspaper men, detectives and
anxious relatives searching for her,
Miss Webber succeeded in slipping into
â Chicago early this morning, breakfast
ing with the man who a few hours
later became her husband and return
ing to the Auditorium Annex to-night
as his wife. It is as romantic a tale
â¢as has come out of the sunshine and
.flowers of California, or any other lo
cality, in many' a day and has been
.carried on with the most improved
modern devices. '
.... Six weeks Ago Charles F. Dwyer was
unknown to most Golden Gate people.
â His' name was known to the racetrack
.â¢follow 2nd many had heard it men
tioned, as that of the young man whose
consistent backing of Tod Sloan's
â¢mounts in England last fall had netted
him' '._> 000.. . â¢ AA:
' 'Then Dwyer came to San Francisco
.and aH was changed. Miss Webber
â came. into his view as a vision perched
high." upon the box of a T cart behind
.a. pair of tandem ponies, and Dwyer
was. impassive no longer. Tod Sloan
arid ' Eddie Bald, his traveling com
.pahions,. found him preferring his own
thoughts to their previous jollity, and
they knew that a change had come. -
' :.F">r two weeks he strove to obtain an
introduction '.to his divinity. He
.searched everywhere, for a mutual
friend, and at length became ac
quainted with Captain Pollock, late of
the . Rough Riders, a warm friend of
Miss' Webber. .In the meantime Miss
â¢Webber had not been blind. She had
â¢noticed the fixed stare of Dwyer's eyes,
turned always in her direction upon the
dozen .or more times she happened to be
hear him during these two weeks, and
she, too; found herself. loving the man
she knew only by name and by hearsay.
Then- came an introduction by Captain
Pollock that won for Dwyer a wife. In
'a. .downtown restaurant in San Fran
cisco Dwyer found Captain Pollock and
'ijrss Webber among an after-theater
supper, party and obtained the intro
duction which left him free to tell his
love.
- .They met but infrequently after that.
but association was not necessary. One
week ago last Thursday Dwyer and
.'Sioan' left San Francisco for Chicago.
."The evening before he bade good-hv
'to .-his sweetheart, but by no means
.gave her up. He did not ask her to
write to him or promise to write to her. \
â¢His methods were far more energetic
â He"" proposed an elopement then and
there, but Miss Webber hesitated. The
premier jockey and the premier plun
ger departed alone. Before he was
across the ferry and in the station' at.
Oakland, Dwyer regretted his depart
ure. He was silent until the train
reached Omaha. There he left the train
and conferred with General Passenger
and Ticket Agent Lomax of the Union
Pacific. A few minutes later this mes
sage was in Miss Webber's hands:
** Miss you dreadfully. Ticket for Chica
go "for you at Oakland depot. Come on
at .once and we will be married in Chica
go: Lovingly, CHARLEY.
.'.The young woman's movements were
closely watched, and every argument
.was used to induce her to abandon all
thought of the young turf follower, but
to no purpose. She left her home with
but a small grip, for the apparent pur
pose of visiting some relatives in
Sausalito, a suburb of San Francisco,
but it was speedily discovered that Chi
cago was her real destination. By the
next overland train a pursuit was be
gun, while messages hurried ahead to
.-friends of the family in Chicago ask
ing that she be intercepted.
â¢-. These plans, came to the ears of
Dwyer in Chicago, and plans were im
mediately made to balk them. He dis
covered that he was being shadowed
by â¢ detectives, and late Friday night
the following telegram was sent:

This message was sent in duplicate to
Clinton and Cedar Rapids, lowa.
Yesterday morning at 7:45 o'clock a
i Union Pacific train rolled Into Well-
I street depot, and upon the platform
: stood a silent English servant, carry
ing a mandolin case. He was "Doc."
Tod Sloan's valet. His instructions were
to look for a "pretty, big-eyed girl."
and with the clew each of them held
they discovered one another immedi
ately. The servant quietly followed
Miss Webber out from the station,
where a cab was waiting and escorted
her to the Victoria Hotel, where ' she j
registered as "Miss May Lewis, Indian- ;
apolis." "Doc" retired by a circuitous
route to his master's apartments at the
Auditorium and "Miss Lewis of In
dianapolis" was shown to a room.
At 10 o'clock Charles F. Dwyer ap
peared before the desk of the hotel and
sent his card to Miss Lewis. He met
her in the ladies' parlor, and shortly
afterward the two left the hotel and
walked boldly to the elevator in the
Annex. |A moment later both were
safe in Sloan's suite at breakfast, while
the jockey and his valet barred the
door to all save the hurrying waiters,
who flitted in attendance upon the
wondrously happy pair. .','â¢'â¢".
Then a problem arose. The record
in the marriage license clerk's office
was distrusted and Milwaukee was de
cided upon as safer from interferences
at the last moment, j Tickets were pur
chased and Tod Sloan was ready to
start to perform the duties of best man,
when it occurred to him that he was
entirely too well known and too notice
able a figure to pose as guide and men
tor of an eloping couple seeking a quiet
and secret marriage. The plans were
changed. Sloan sacrificed his , desire
and became a martyr for the afternoon.
Sitting in a chair in the lobby of" the
hotel, he sought to impress upon , the
curious that he, Sloan, who by all the
claims of friendship and circumstances
should be at the groom's left hand, was
still in Chicago.
Lou M. Houseman, an intimate friend
of both men, was hurriedly summoned
and installed in the position of best
man. Dwyer appeared in the lobby of
the hotel as a flank movement, while
Houseman, with Miss Webber, took a
cab in front of the hotel. The vehicle
whirled around the corner to the Con
gress-street entrance just as Dwyer
stepped out, and In an instant he was
inside and away for the Northwestern
depot. The 3 o'clock train hurried
them to Milwaukee. - - ;
Drawn up alongside the depot at
Milwaukee by previous arrangement
were two carriages. There was to have
been a Catholic priest within one of
them ready to perform the ceremony,
but it was found upon their arrival J
that the rules of the church forbade j
such a proceeding and no priest could j
be engaged. A civil marriage was at |
once suggested and agreed upon and
the couple were driven to the home of
Judge Ries, while the best man and
another Chicagoan who had *been
pressed into service on the way to the
station scurried about the shopping
district in pursuit erf a wedding ring, j
a marriage certificate blank, violets and
other accessories. ? . -
The abettors of the love match were
finally assembled about the couple, and
in formal earnest tones the magistrate
pronounced the words of the civil cere
mony and declared Charles F. |
Dwyer of Brooklyn and Lois Mai Web- !
ber of Oakland man and wife. The
certificate was filled out and the names
of Lou M. Houseman and Walter Def
fenbaugh attached as witnesses. The
ceremony was witnessed by Norton J.
Field of Milwaukee also.
From Judge Reis' residence the newly
wedded pair and the two witnesses
drove to the Empire restaurant, where
a wedding repast was served, while an
orchestra played the wedding march
from "Lohengrin." From there they
drove to the Northwestern station and
took the 7:15 train for Chicago. Arriv
ing in this city the elopement was
ended, and the present address of Mr.
and Mrs. Charles F. Dwyer is fiat F,
Auditorium Annex, although * - their
names do not appear on the register.
Such are the details of an elopement
which successfully brought a young
girl alone half way across the conti

SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 18.âRepresen
tative Law of Cache County, a Republi
can, to-day on the floor of the joint ses
sion of the Legislature formally charged
A. W. McCune (D.), a candidate for Sen
ator, with bribery. He said McCune had
been hounding him for some time past
with a view of .obtaining his vote, but
that he had as often told him that he
would not vote for him. Then McCune
held out to him the fact that he was a
poor man; that he had a wife and family
to support, and that It would be well
worth his while to cast his vote for Mc-
Cune and he could name his own price if
he would do so. - ;
On Friday afternoon, at the close of the
joint session, McCune again approached
Law and reiterated the proposition hith
erto made. Law told him that he would
see him on Saturday morning. He then
went to the Chief of Police and laid the
matter before that official, when plans
were laid to catch McCune.- --y â¢:.â¢
McCune met Law by .appointment yes
terday morning and after the matter had
been again, talked over McCune offered
Law $1500, which the latter agreed* to ac
cept. Law wanted a friend to go with
him to a private room to finish the details
and receive the money, but this McCune
objected to and the two men went out
upon the street. McCune told him that he
had only $80 with him, but would put up
that amount to bind the bargain.
"You go across the street," said Mc-
Cune. "and I will meet you. When I
shake hands I'll leave the money with
you." " ~"?
Law went- out, and as he did .so he
asked a friend whom he had not seen for
some time to watch the proceedings. This
the friend did, and says he saw McCune
hand Law the money. This action was
witnessed also by a detective and others
who were on the watch.
The announcement created a profound
sensation on the floor of the Legislature,
and, after a stormy scene, an investigat
ing committee was appointed, which will
begin work on Monday morning. McCune
Is the promoter and the builder of the
Utah and Paeilie Railroad, and Is a very
wealthy man, being engaged extensively
in British Columbia mines. McCune's
friends say the. whole I thing is a put-up
job, and assert that Law offered to sell
them his vote for $5000, but the offer was
refused. â  _______' ""V '.'

sume a most vigorous offensive cam

he will feel justified soon In doing this
to prevent the demoralization of his

FAMISHED REARS
ENTER THE CITY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Feb. 18.â "Look
out for bearsâ they are nosing around
close to the city," are the headlines in
a local paper which startled citizens to
day. The report that bears had en
tered British Columbia cities this win
ter has been sent to outside â  papers,
but for . obvious reasons it has never
appeared in provincial papers. Bruinâ
that is, .three of himâ became more dar
ing than usual, actually entering Van
couver, and the papers could not over
look the fact.
Several young men yesterday noticed
three black bears around Trout Lake,
where the citizens of Vancouver dis
port themselves on the ice in severe
weather. They hurried to the city, a
distance of. two miles, with the news
that Bruin and his companions were
making this way.
Helmer and McKenzie. two men from
the Klondike, possessed of nerve, Win
chester rifles and a degree of marks
manship, sallied out to meet: the deni
zens of the forest. The bears were en
countered just within the city boundary
on the high road to the heart of Van
couver. They were mad with hunger
and were on a kind of dog trot. Sev
eral ranchers who saw them approach
ing and who were unarmed turned their
horses' heads and made with all speed
back to the city. yy'AA y
McKenzie and Helmer were not to be
intimidated. They stood in the middle
of the road and as the bears ap
proached on a swinging trot they
opened fire. About fifty people watched
them at : a distance. The two young
bears dropped in their tracks, mortally
wounded. Before the Klondikers could
reload old Bruin was almost upon them.
They took to their heels, closely fol
lowed by the bear, which followed them
into the city. . .^IAAyAyMA'AyAyiAA:
It was a strange sight and one not
often witnessed in a city of 25,000 in
habitants. .'_.;-;- '1 â¢":'â¢'â 'â¢
Just when it appeared that the Klon
dikers were to make a meal for. the
bear a man with a rifle emerged from
a hotel on Powell- street and brought
the brute to Its knees. Another shot
quickly dispatched it.
The carcasses of the three bears
were secured and brought to a meat
market, where to-night they were
viewed by hundreds.

SAN SAN . RAFAEL, - Feb. : 18.â Chris
Klein, the butcher whose slaughter house

of members of the San Rafael Golf ' Club,
has determined not jto yield ' without a
struggle, and by Attorney E. B. Marti
nelll to-day filed an answer to the com
plaint of Henry C. Campbell, in which
every charge made In the petition for an
Injunction is denied. The answer is made
both for Klein and John Braunlng, the
owner of the land. >
| Both defendants to the. suit deny that
the stream of water flowing from their
land across the golf links ever has offal
thrown Into It; that It is used by the
plaintiff for domestic purposes, or that
it is .pure enough to be used. : It is af
firmed that the slaughter house is kept
as. clean as possible and that no odors
containing microbes emanate from it.
while the claim of ; Campbell that re
peated requests have been made for the
slaughter house to be moved ls vigorous
ly denied. ?â â¢â '
Klein's answer further states that many
thousands of dollars' have been expended
ln the improvement of his- property, and
that the suit tends to damage his busi
ness. ' He asks that the action be dis
missed and that plaintiff pay * the costs
of suit, as well as attorneys' fees. The
case comes up In court next Monday.

, Manila ' favors the tactics the natives
! seem to have adopted after learning
| that they could not face the American
i soldier in the open field, and it doubt-
I less , will be General Otis' task, just as
| soon as his reinforcements reach, him,
to clear them away. Half a dozen na
tives concealed in the jungle and firing
l at long range at intervals could make
life unbearable for a whole company
of regular troops until they were dis
lodged. Military officers who have had
experience in this kind of fighting say
that men become panicky .and lose
their nerve under this treatment. That
j is, however, what'- they must expect, oc
cupying the outposts and trenches
miles outside of Manila during the
rainy season, protecting the water
works and strategic points unless a de
termined effort is made before : the
country becomes impassible owing to
the rains to carry the war straight into
the interior and chase Aguinaldo's men
beyond the range of activity. -.-.??
It is estimated that at the rate of
progress now making by the transport
Grant the 1800 troops on that ship will
land at Manila about March 4. A couple
of weeks later the Sherman will arrive
with a similar number , of troops, and
: two weeks after that the Sheridan is
I due with the troops now embarking at
i New York. Before * the last of these
I troops reach Manila the dry season will
! have gotten well toward an end and
j only a few weeks will be left for active
' operations, so there is need for steady
: work in the preparation at all points
j in order to assure a fairly comfortable
j summer for our troops. A considera
j tion that favors the termination of the
I struggle at an early date is that the
I latest reports indicate fairly that the
i Insurgents are becoming short of am
munition and with redoubled vigilance
on the part of the. naval forces around
Luzon they may be brought to terms
on this account as much as from any
other. Ay:~y'AA~y : ~' yy. AA'AA'AA
ESCAMILLO TALKS
TO SAVE HIS LIFE
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by Jam':s Ooidon
Bennett. 'V,.- v.- '.-
MANILA. Feb. 18.â have just visited
the prison by permission of General
Hughes and obtained an interview with
Antonio Escamillo, a captain' on the
Filipino staff and personal interpreter to
Aguinaldo. Being 111, he came to Manila
a fortnight prior to the outbreak and was
arrested on the street on February 5.
He Is said to be Agulnaldo's private sec
retary, but denies it. He says he knew
nothing of the preparation for hostilities',
being at the theater at the time of the
outbreak, and was astonished at his ar
rest. * ' ,; ",-
"I regret the outbreak." he said, "and
deeply deplore the bloodshed, because we
were confident we could accomplish an
amicable settlement. If released on pa
role I desire to proceed to Hongkong." '
He says he is well treated, and is aston
ished that so much importance is at
tached to him.
The heat was very oppressive to-day,
and the troops, especially those who are
compelled to work in the open, have been
affected. It will probably be warmer from
now on until the rainy season.
The rebels have, been concentrating
south of the Pasig River, in front of
Brigadier-General Ovenshine's lines on
the right, all day long. The country in
that vicinity is a particularly thick jun
gle, extending for miles. The scouts re-*
port that the rebels are probably coming
from Laguna and Cavite provinces. The
Americans are strongly entrenched from
the beach to the Pasig.
SHE WOULD THRASH
ATTORNEY KEYES
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. Miss Margaret
Manning, who is being made, the defend
ant in a suit for the* possession of prop
erty deeded to her by her father, became
nettled to-day at a question asked by
Attorney J. W. Keyes while making a
deposition before Notary Public T. P.
Boyd, and threatened to horsewhip him
If he did not show, her the consideration
she claimed was her due. A sensational
scene was prevented by the coolness of
Keyes and Hepburn Wilkins, Miss Man-"
ning's attorney.
Andrew â¢; Manning died at Tomales.
Shortly before his death he deeded prop
erty valued at $15,000 to his daughter Mar
garet. A brother, named . Joseph, em
ployed by the Southern Pacific Company,
has filed suit to have the deed annulled
on. the ground of fraud. The woman was
required to make a deposition In. the case
to-day. A question in regard to an alleged
transaction regarding the use to which
$500 was put caused her to spring to her
feet and tragically threaten to thrash the
lawyer. He remained cool, and the others
present interceded in time to prevent fur
ther trouble. Attorney Keyes says he
will prove his charges, but ex-Sheriff Tun
stead, who is cognizant of the facts de
clares there ls nothing in them.
MURDER IN SPOKANE.
SPOKANE, Feb. 18.-A murder was
committed in the Crowded Cover d'Alene
gambling rooms- to-night. James Lacey,
who was released from the County Jail
to-day, where he had been held on a
charge of holding up a saloon, owned by
James Albi, entered the long hall and
brushed by Albi, who was standing by one
of the tables. Albt spoke to him, but he
ignored him and passed on. Albi drew a
revolver and tired three shots. Lacey
fell In a death struggle. 33bi. placed the
revolver to his own head and fired, but the
bullet went high and passed through his
hat. He then dashed down the stairway
and escaped. ' â â¢
j Last July Lacey killed John Murphy in
a quarrel over the proceeds derived from
â¢the holdlng-up of Albi's saloon. He was
tried, acquitted and then re-arrested on
the charge of holding. up the saloon.

HITCHES CAUSE
MUCH ANXIETY
Anglo - American Com
mission Causes Worry.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Feb. 18.â Telegrams from
Washington reporting that the Anglo-
American Commission is encountering
serious head seas are followed here with
much anxiety, as the opinion prevails
here that the future of the Anglo-
American entente largely depends on
the success of the present negotiations.
The Speaker voices the general feel
ing by saying that the news regarding
the commission is very disquieting.
"It is impossible," the Speaker adds, "to
say where the fault lies, but a failure
to arrive at an understanding will be
a. serious blow to the hopes of both
countries in regard to the future re
lationships. Perhaps the less we say
about the matter while it is still in
suspense the better it will be for the
prospects of satisfactory settlement."
The Saturday Review, as usual, finds
the United States is entirely responsible
for the hitches in the negotiations. It
says: "There are signs that we shall
receive another object lesson very soon
as to the real nature of the sudden great
affection which America is said to have
developed for England. The Anglo-
American Commission has been strug
gling to arrive at an agreement, but the
process has not thus far been charac
terized by an overwhelming desire on
the part of America to deal generously
with Canada. \ It will not be a surprise
to those who know the character of the
Washington politician â if the report
that a failure Is practically assured
proves to be true."
The Saturday Review has another
hasty comment with reference to the
resolution of United States Senator. Mc-
Enery in regard to the Philippines,
which the paper declares is mere time
serving for the Senate to pass. "This
resolution," the Review continues, 'is
simply the outcome of a maneuver to
secure the necessary vote to adopt the
Paris treaty of peace. The reputation,
of President McKinley's Government \m
indeed likely to disappear altogether J*
view of - the report of the War Offi.e
maladministration. It is an astounding
scandal to find officials who are respon
sible for the gross .-' irregularities *nd
mismanagement of the war "carefully
whitewashed, while a plain-dealing sol- 1
dier like General Miles is ; discredited.
The report, however, is a good dbject
lesson to the people of England, it will
show them how the bosses .. week, the
machine, and how ; unscrupulous, even
when his own country is concerned, the
Washington politician can became."
The scheme of Rear Admiral Lord
Charles Beresford "for the settlement
of the Far Eastern question' W the for
mation, of a league to be 'ccmposed.of
'*& United States, Great Brftain, Ger
many, and : Japan, as cable*' here from
the ; United States, has not aroused en
thusiasm in Great Britair The Spec
tator characterizes BeresfJrd*s?'plan as
"futile and* needless as it/ is immoral."
It then proceeded to argue that neither
of the powers mentioned prepared to
provide an army to resist a Russian in
vasion. AIAAA-y â¢ * / ' â¢'-* â  ;
.On the contrary," the Spectator
says, "Great Britain' wJuld feel through
a i her '' veins that a * Russian [ conquest
of Northern China hid indefinitely in
creased the security <Â»f her Indian em
plre by at once absorbing . Russian
means and satisfying Russian ambi
tion, while America, which is only seek
ing trade,, has no army to throw away.
The work would have to be left to < 'hi
na and her new. made .army, which will
require half a century of victory to
make it equal to a Russian army." .
Statistics published . relative to ." the
national income and expenditure indi
cate that it is almost certain there will
be a deficiency in the budget. During
the first forty-five weeks of the. present -
fiscal year, the customs have shrunk
Â£574,000, and the total income has di
minished Â£175,000, while the expendi
ture has increase by Â£4,750,000. There
fore there is every prospect that the in
come tax will have to be increased- to 9
per cent. y AT^y'f.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 18.â The Su
preme Court handed down a decision in
the gubernatorial contest to-day. Wil
liam . McMillan contested the seat on
alleged "irregularities of the ballots. The
decision is practically in Sadler's fa
vor. The result of the decision will de
feat the recount of about one-fifth of
the entire allegations in the relator's i
complaint, leaving the other four-fifths
to be contested and tried on their
merits. The validity of over 100 votes,
which the relator alleges should accrue
to his benefit, is permitted by the de
cision to be regularly tested and deter
mined.
The opinion of the court that the sol
diers' vote should not be counted de
prives McMillan of thirteen votes to
which it is alleged he was entitled, and
effectually disposes of that portion of
the complaint.
The relator's attorneys were given
five days to amend their complaint, and
the respondent was allowed twenty
days in which to answer.

Varsity Nine.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 18.â
| The Fireman's Fund nine of San Fran
i cisco defeated the Stanford Varsity on the
campus this afternoon by a score of 5 to 1.
The game was extremely close and Inter
esting up to the eighth inning, when some
costly errors on the part of Stanford al
lowed three men to cross the plate. The
particular feature of the contest was the
work done by the pitchers. I.anagan
played the best game to-day that has
been put. up by any of the Stanford twirl
era at any time this season. His speed
; and curves were good and his control bet
i ter than in any previous exhibition. Mos
klman for the Fireman's Fund was steady
and heady. The Varsity on the whole
i outflelded their opponents, but went to
| pieces at a critical time. The game, while
It went against- the collegians, was not
disappointing-. It showed that the Varsity
I has excellent material and is improving
The score was as follows:

zA Charming Exhibit
of the Spring Silk and Wool
Dress Fabrics.
There are two kinds of opening displays. The one is of fab-
rics that all stores carry, the same patterns, the same colors,
an everlasting sameness. The other is of exclusive uncommon
things, the goods that give an individuality and distinctiveness
to a woman's costume. It is the latter kind that our buyers
have endeavored to obtain, and to some of the advance ship-
ments of which we to-day call your attention.

CONSULAR DIPLOMACY.
LAST spring the* Filipinos were in arms against
Spain, as they had been for a hundred years.
They have all that time aspired to independence
and have fought, fallen, and fought again for the right
to establish a government of their own. They have
practically been in possession for a century of most
of the area of the islands, from which they have suc
cessfully excluded Spanish jurisdiction.'
War being on between the United States and
Spain, Dewey's fleet appeared at Hongkong, and
Aguinaldo arrived at Singapore. The subsequent
proceedings are told in the , report of United States
Consul Pratt of Singapore:
"When six weeks ago I learned that General
Aguinaldo had arrived, incognito, at Singapore I
immediately sought him out." An .hour's interview
convinced me he was the man for the occasion, and
having communicated with' Admiral Dewey, . I ac
cordingly arranged for him to join the latter, which
he did at Cavite. I am thankful to have been the
means, though merely the accidental means, of bring
ing about the arrangement between General Aguin
aldo and Admiral Dewey which has resulted so hap
pily. I can only hope that the eventual outcome will
be all that can be desired for the happiness and wel
fare of the Filipinos."
There is no doubt that Consul Pratt took our
declaration of war to be in good faith, and believed
we were embarking in an altruistic struggle to make
free and independent the victims of centuries of
Spanish denial of self-government. So believing,
Consul Pratt secured "an arrangement" between
Aguinaldo and Dewey. What that arrangement was
is not revealed by either. Its terms are unknown to
the people of the United States. We' are permitted to
believe that it was in line with our solemn abjuration
of conquest, however, and Pratt's hope that it would
er.d in "the happiness and welfare of the Filipinos"
can only mean that it was made to secure the inde
pendence and freedom for which they had so long
fought against Spain. , -
We must resort to the Filipino interpretation of
this arrangement at Singapore for further light, and
therein we find confirmation of the above view. Ad
dressing Pratt the Filipinos said: "The programme
arranged between you and General Aguinaldo we
hope will secure to us our independence."
Consul Pratt's ambitious diplomacy has been con
cluded by his recall, rebuke and dismissal from the
service, his offense being that he â¢ took our Con
gressional denial of the intention to make conquests
to be true, and in line with that and with our ancient
'policy negotiated an arrangement to help the Fili
pinos to their independence. Aguinaldo and his
countrymen do not seem to have had any suspicion
that a consular representative of this Government
would seek them out, as Pratt admits he did, to ar
range for their military co-operation in return for
their independence without having authority so to do.
There was no American Minister handy to make ne
gotiations. We had a Minister in Pekii.r. one in Tokio
and one in Seoul, too distant to be consulted. Again,
there is evidence that the arrangement made by Consul
Pratt at Singapore was ratified by Consul Wildman
at Hongkong. The latter went so far as to be
trusted with the $47,000 belonging to the Filipino
Junta, and the correspondence between him and
Aguinaldo reveals their mutual understanding of
Consul Pratt's "arrangement." Wildman was im
mediately promoted to the Chinese Consul Generalcy,
which must have seemed to the Filipinos recognition
and reward by his Government for his part in the
! negotiation.
So it is impossible to extract any other conclusion
out of the situation than that the Filipinos believed
official guarantees had passed between them and the
authorized representatives of this Government.
Dewey carried out the arrangement and, Spanish
power being terminated and yet no official disavowal
of the Singapore negotiation appearing, the Filipinos
expected its fulfillment. In the height of this expec
tation Spain sold and we bought them for $20,000,000
and Pratt was recalled!
The Filipino is probably a simple savage, but let
us respect his confusion now that he finds the Sin
gapore negotiation apparently ratified as long as it
served the interests of the United States, and re
pudiated at the point where the Filipino interest ap
peared.
ASIATIC INVASION.
THE Chronicle admits its hostility to a large
standing army and to the imperial colonization
of the Philippines, but preserves its rejected
aspiration for the incorporation of the Philippines as
American territory. This aspect of expansion has
peculiar interest for the people of the United States,
and pre-eminently for American citizens in California,
in Oregon, in Washington and in other Western
States farther removed from the Pacific. For nearly
thirty years a peaceful Asiatic invasion of the United
States was in progress. The Golden Gate of our har
bor was the "open door" through which the Chinese
poured their cheap labor and their infectious vice. They
competed with and underbid white. men in the cities
and' in the rural districts. They absorbed our
Substance like caterpillars. They lived on
Chinese food, and returned their earnings and
themselves, including their dead bodies, to
their native land. They- debauched many of our
youth of both sexes. - For nearly a generation they
were a constant pestilence in our midst and those who
are left are of the immutable type of their progeni
tors. The Chinese resident of 1850 and the Chinese
resident of 1899 are exactly alike.
The effort to check this invasion and to minimize
and ultimately to exclude this unassimilating and un-
American element from our population caused one of
the hardest and most protracted contests recorded in
the annals of Congress. For years the Chinese had
their advocates in our own midst, who anticipated
every proposition of the expansionists. Sentimental
ists appealed to manifest destiny, and in some degree
were temporarily backed by the religious element. It
was argued that the extension of trade and commerce
with Asia depended upon the free acceptance of immi
grants from the Chinese empire. It was urged that
this continent would absorb Mongolians like a
sponge. These pagans, whose head and tail sprouted
from the same end, attended our Sunday-schools in
order to learn the English tongue, and they were to
be Christianized and converted into American mis
sionaries for the regeneration of Asia.
But the evil grew and spread until it became un
bearable^ and the steady reduction of wages and the
growth of the indescribable forms of Chinese vicious
ness, which, most intense and concentrated in Califor
nia, reached the Atlantic border, the Great Lakes and
the Gulf of Mexico, produced a virulence and a
unanimity of public sentiment that Congress could
not resist. Exclusion laws were passed and gradu
ally improved until this revolting element in Amer
ican civilization is arrested and is undergoing a slow
process of extirpation.
Thus the question of expansion, inverted in form,
but practically on the very lines now projected by
the advocates of Asiatic annexation, as perfunctorily
distinguished from imperial .colonization, was argued,
THE SAN. FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1899.
fought and apparently settled. The only dissentients
were that "class of capitalists, mainly at the East, but
embracing some of our railroad proprietors, to whom
an unlimited supply of cheap labor was the highest
evidence of American grandeur. These men, who
were paupers in every ingredient of American
wealth except money, deliberately sought to substi
tute Chinese contract labor for African slavery. In
co-operation with speculators, who confound gam
bling with commerce, and with a few visionary enthu
siasts, who have no rational conceptions whatever,
they are now seeking to justify an American invasion
of Asia and the replacement of the excluded : Chinese
by Filipino fellow-citizens, with available muscle, but
thick with the disease, filth and brutishness of the
torrid zone. The Chinese forced themselves upon
us in steadily increasing numbers until they were
stayed by the strong arm of American law. The Fili
pinos, once, admitted to citizenship, will -be, beyond
Congressional power. , , -*â¢** ;
This is the necessary outcome of the. position to
which the Chronicle adheres, directly at variance
with its former relations to the Asiatic question,' and,
apart from its unconstitutional features, involving a
policy that antagonizes every leading . interest of the
country and prominently of this coast, - Upon further
consideration, we hope the conversion of our con
temporary may become fixed and not contingent. j
SIMPSON'S "CINCH BILL.
SPEAKING of the unspeakable Simpson's bill
relating to gas corporations,' introduced into
the Legislature shortly before the Senator's
fait from grace, a morning contemporary declares
that the apparent concession to the public proposed
by the. measure is a fraud. "There is no provision of
law now," says this journal, "by which companies
may charge for a meter, and as a matter of, fact they
do not and cannot."
This is partly true and partly a mistake. The law
does not at present authorize gas corporations to
charge for setting up meters, but as a matter of fact
both of the companies in San Francisco engaged in
furnishing illuminating material to the people do
exact a deposit, which is equivalent to such a charge.
The pretext of this exaction is that it is a time-hon
ored custom, but, in fact, the gas companies take ad
vantage of the ignorance of their patrons to demand
the money. They know the law does not authorize
the extortion, and they know that when served with
notice they are required to set up meters within ten
days or suffer a penalty of $50, and $10 a day for each
day's further delay, but still they require the deposits,
and get them if possible.
. The bill of the unspeakable Simpson is not only not
a concession to the public, but it proposes to legalize
the present illegal deposits.* It is not a "cinch" bill
in the ordinary sense, but it is a bill to "cinch" the
consumers of gas, and it is peculiarly appropriate that
it should have been introduced by a man who betrays
his constituents, violates his pledges and embarks on
a drunken spree preliminary to taking his mud bath.
This bill should receive no consideration whatever
from the Legislature. Apart from the character of
its author, it is an outrageous proposition to compel
consumers of gas to deposit security for their bills.
No other corporations engaged in supplying the
necessaries are granted any such privilege. No mer
chant or dealer is authorized by law to demand pay
ment in advance.
If the Legislature desires to bring down upon its
head the maledictions of three .hundred thousand peo
ple they will pass this measure. If they prefer the
praises of all consumers of gas everywhere they will
consign Simpson's, bill to the oblivion which y- will
overtake its author upon his retirement from office
and enact another which has been introduced making
contracts for deposits invalid. If there is to be any
legislation upon this subject at all it should be of the
last named character.
ACCORDING to the London Chronicle, recent
tests made off the coast of England have
demonstrated that wireless telegraphy has now
reached a point of development where it is of prac
tical value, and in all probability will soon be applied
to use on a large scale.
The system tested was that of Signor Marconi, and
under his direction several trials were made of send
ing messages without wires between one of the East
Goodwin lightships, twelve miles at sea, and a light
house on the neighboring coast. The experiments
were supervised by representatives from the Town
Councils of Dover, Margate, Broadstairs and Sand
gate.
The height of the point of transmission from the
lighthouse was 130 feet, and that on the mast of the
lightship was eighty feet. The trials were continued
for a considerable period, during much of which time
there prevailed off the coast some of the severest
weather of the season, and, in fact, at one time the
wind pressure is said to have passed all previous
records.
Notwithstanding the storm and the wind, the tests
were in every respect successful. Messages were ac
curately transmitted back and forth between the ship
and the land, being so clearly recorded they were un
derstood not only by the experts who assisted Signor
Marconi, but by men on the lightship who had re
ceived instruction in the work.
The cost is virtually nothing. when compared with
that of wire telegraphy. Thus one of the officials who
supervised the trials stated that the cost of estab
lishing electrical communication between the four
Goodwin lightships and the shore by the Marconi
system would not exceed Â£100, while in the last offi
cial Blue Book Â£10,000 was set down as the estimated
cost of cable connection, which, moreover, would not
be certain in bad weather.
Until further developments are made the system
will be valuable chiefly to the life-saving service along
the stormy coasts, where a considerable-amount of
shipping is* always more or less in danger. It is pos
sible, however, it may be used eventually in place of
wire telegraphy in all cases where the distance to be
covered is short. It is believed the messages can be
transmitted as much as twenty miles. Commenting on
the outlook the Chronicle says:" â¢;. '.
"The current, we are told, travels at the rate of 1800
miles a second eighteen times each way to Brighton!
If this be so, aerial telegraphy will be a formidable
rival to telegraphy by the speediest wires. And as for
telephony, it will, of course, become a mere antique
toy. Angelina, in Upper Tooting, will be able to
speak all day long to Edwin, in Cornhill, should
other currents hot interfere â in these tendernesses
they sometimes do. The telephone, considering its
cost in London, and continual interruption, will pass
away without regret, and every one will converse,
aerially, in the modified Morse alphabet. But no;
limitations come in. 'Cross currents,' as Mr. Morley
would say, may play an important nay, a tragic â
part in these communications." : .

The other day an old woman, alone,
friendless, without money, was told to
vacate the miserable apartment which \
was her only home.. "I will go to

word; for on the morrow she was found
dead by her own hand. In all the hard

blaming the innocent, ever ready to
cast a stone, there ought not to be one
so pitiless as to censure I do not

The bill introduced in the Senate to
stop the practice of hunting deer with
hounds suits me exactly. The hound
ing of deer is classed as sport, but it
ought to be classed as cruelty to ani
mals. The impulse to kill a deer is
hard to understand.'. This beautiful
creature has committed no greater of
fense than that of being alive, and yet
at sight of it the ' average citizen
reaches for his gun and turns loose his
dogs. The deer live in localities where
they in no way interfere with progress.
They do not, like- the buffalo of blessed
memory, exhaust ranges ' which are
needed for domestic animals or tor
fields and orchards. They do no harm,
and yet they are being killed so fast
that unless the process be checked the
deer will be extinct in a short term of
I years, slain for the human lust of
blood, for the love of inflicting torture,
for the savage Instinct there remains
in us. I would call off the dogs, and
the owners of the dogs, and make the
pastime so costly that the hunter could
I better afford to live on large bottles
I and small birds than on venison. Of
course, the deer supplies meat, but peo
ple who live in the country and kill far
more than the fancy sportsmen who
I go there once a year do not need this
I meat, and indeed would rather eat salt
I pork. I think that if God had intended
the deer for the amusement of people
whom nothing but the spectacle of suf
fering can satisfy, He would not have
given to It expressive eyes capable of
I accusing a man of murder.

Justice, a quarterly magazine de
voted to anti-monopoly, reaches my
desk. Being* heartily in sympathy
with it, I regret the impossibility of its
being a success. In the first place, no
publication appearing but once in three
months can retain a following, for it
will be forgotten between Issues. In
the second place, this particular period
ical is too heavy to be attractive.
While it is being issued once, the great
dailies, most of them avowedly the
creatures of monopoly, will be issued
a hundred times. There are many
truths in Justice. There are dire proph
ecies which are destined to be fulfilled,
but people do not care. They think in
their selfish blindness that life' is short,
and the coming calamities are to fall
upon generations yet unborn. Thus
wealth will continue the process of con.
centration into' the hands of the few,
the toiler approach nearer and nearer
a condition of slavery. What Is to be
done about it? Not a thing. Some
day there will be a crash and a smash,
but that will be a long time .in the fu
ture This country is not going on in
definitely seeing all its wealth gathered
into the hands of the Rockefellers ana
the Sages and by them bequeathed in
bulk to posterity no better than that
of the smith and the plowman. You
need not try to scare me about th*
perils of imperialism, serious as these
may be. 3 For a genuine menace to th.
welfare of this glorious country they
are not in it. N If the rottenness of our
political system does not get in its work

they have noticed that the churches are

bearing a share of the common burden
and think they have at least equal
claims. The average farmer works like
a slave. He does not know what leisure
is. All he can wrest from his acres goes
to pay the interest on his mortgage.
As to paying the mortgage itself he
never dreams except in that vague way
it is permitted all of us to dream of
heaven. The mortgage he bequeaths to
his son, together with an incumbered
plow and a harrow bought on credit.

The mothers of the Filipinos might as

our missionaries long ago and in token
of gratitude the missionaries rose up
and accepted the islands with all their

residents, of the Philippines will do as
well. They will have to do as well or

public goes to see. to stretch its curious
neck and to wonder which of the suffer
ing fools will first fall utterly exhausted,
and if he fall dead the public will re
joice in an assurance of having reÂ«
ceived its moneys worth. God made
man in his own image, but presuma
bly not for the purpose of- having the
image broken on the wheel. If people
choose to commit suicide by miles and
laps, I would take no step to prevent
them, because there are plenty of fee
ble minded to be cared for anyhow,
and self-destruction to the tune of a
band and in the glare of electric lights
is as good as the less unostentatious
methods of gaa or poison. But to
tempt men to suicide is distinctly
wrong, and therefore a burden of guilt
rests upon the promoters of these ab
horrent affairs. Nevertheless, they are
the ones who make the money out of
them. They are not going crazy, nor
losing their eyesight, nor shortening
their years. "When the riders are dead
or asylumed or crippled the managers
will collect a new set of dupes, and
the public will pay to get in. â¢ .
Senator Simpson has. been the chief
advocate at Sacramento of a Sunday
law. The high moral ground he must
necessarily assume in defending this
measure is one upon which I do not see
how he can feel at home. Possibly I
am mistaken, but during the weeks I
was in Sacramento, seeing Simpson
frequently, he always impressed me as
being drunk. Perhaps it is not sur- '.
prising that he should advocate the
law, either, for to do so a man would
have to be Intoxicated on liquor or
blinded by a selfish egotism which
would turn his mind awry as thorough
ly as the climax of a jamboree. .Of all
the measures which have appeared this
session I regard the Sunday law as the
most vicious and iniquitous. Its enact
ment would .do more harm than the
election of the veriest scalawag to the
Senate, than looting the treasury, for
it would be a deliberate setback to Cali
fornia. No Sunday la*4r is wanted here.
Men crave the liberty to attend divine
worship if they wish, to rest if this
please them better, and they cannot be
legislated into " the meeting-house,
which is the sole object of the scheme
to introduce the Puritan Sabbath. Min
isters should be ashamed to lobby for
it. - When they preach sermons worth
listening to they will have an audience
apiece and the collection plate declare
fair dividends. I am not defending
wanton violation of the Sunday nor
any other day, but simply pleading that
a decent man or a decent woman has,
in matters entirely personal, the right
to be guided by conscience.

Attention of the police is respectfully
called to the collection of hoodlums,
male and female, who lend riotous
clamor to the night in the vicinty of
Ellis and Powell streets. Some of these

News dispatches from Chicago state
that 700 soldiers lately discharged from
the army have had to be assisted by
charity there, having no employment
and no resources. It is a pitiful spec
tacle when able-bodied men, ready to
work, are obliged to eat the bread of
beggary. In a social state approach
ing the ideal no such spectacle would
be possible." If the prosperity of which
we are wont to boast were really in ex
istence, it would not be possible. The
truth has to be recognized that about
our patriotic bragging there is more
than a little pretense. One thing which j
causes indorsement of the scheme for I
supporting a larger army is that it !
would afford a living to men who can't !
make one now, because the walks of i
life in which they belong are over- '
crowded. The remedy, or at least a
partial remedy, would be. in the crea-/
tion of new walks. It is certainly bet- 1
ter that men should be drilled IntJ !
straight-backed troopers, decently uni
formed and entitled to the retention of
self-respect, than that they should ;
slouch into a soup kitchen or starve/

MUNEO SAYS THAT SOLDIERS
ROBBED THE MALLS.
Attempt to Smuggle Merchandise in
Newspapers Thwarted by
the Postal Offi
cials.
Postal Inspector Robert Munro denies
responsibility for the losses of* mail mat
ter between the United States and the
Philippine Islands. He made a sweeping
investigation into the complaints several
months ago and found that the thefts of
mall matter took place while the mall was
in the hands of soldiers for delivery.
Some months ago a newspaper pub
lished in Nebraska stated that four let
ters addressed from Manila to Mrs. Alice
Sims at Wauneta, Neb., had been tam
pered with and valuables extracted there
from.
Inspector Munro's attention ,being called
to the "matter he directed L. H. Bricker,
a clerk. in his office, to make a careful
examination of the mail pouches on the
steamship City of Peking on her arrival
in this port December 12 of last year.
Mr. Bricker took the pouches before they
had been delivered to the Postoffice people
in this city and examined 9000 letters ad
dressed to persons residing elsewhere
than in San Francisco. He found sixty
eight that .. presented the appearance of
having been rifled. These letters were
forwarded to the persons addressed with
the request that they should report as to
whether or not anything had been taken
from them. Sixty-three replies and fifty
four of the envelopes were received. The
replies stated that no property was miss
ing from the letters.
It appeared that in the hot. moist cli
mate of Manila the gummed edges of en
velopes stuck together - and the soldiers
were accustomed to force them open and
reclose them with mucilage, thus giving
the letters the appearance of having been
tampered with.
Major Murtro did not deny that arti
cles had been stolen from the Manila
mails, but he insisted that the thefts were
committed after the malls had been trans
ferred from the postal to the military de
partment He cited one instance where
a soldier lounging in the Red Cross head
quarters saw another soldier inclose a '
money order- in a letter to his wife 'and
drop it: into the letter box. The lounger
immediately called for writing material
and wrote a letter which he also dropped
into tie box. He returned about five min
utes later and asked permission to with
draw the letter he had just written. He
gav>* the address on the letter written to
the soldier's wife and was handed the
letter. This he took away with him, ab
stracted . the money order and cashed it
o: a forged indorsement.
The postal authorities found a large
number of packages, ostensibly newspa
pers, done up with unstamped letters ana
articles of merchandise Inside. These
packages were opened by postal officials
and the unstamped letters returned to tne
dead letter office and the unstamped mer
chandise dumped into the waste PÂ»P*i
baskets. Mr. Munro thinks that consider
able of the complaints made as to tne
non-receipt of letters and merchandise
sent to soldiers ln the Philippines cou
be solved by an examination of tne Bas
kets aforesaid. . . -via
The mail designed for soldiers at Â«a
nila is placed in pouches, each regiment
having a separate pouch. These art no-,
opened at all on the trip and are hanaea
intact to the . military v. authorities, -uy
whom they are distributed. . . Â
The postal authorities here say t Â«*Â« 'Â£
any stealing is done it Is done after tne
mail leaves the hands of the P O /** 1 . ? ' -

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1899.
EXCURSIONISTS VISIT
CLOVERDALE'S FAIR
SCENE IN THE CITRUS FAIR PAVILION AT CLOVERDALE.
CLOVERDALE, Feb. IS.â Cloverdale
was radiant to-night. The streets were
thronged with visitors, the pavilion
overflowed with well-dressed humanity,
unstinted in praise of the magnificent
citrus exhibit. Crowded trains came
from all points. San Francisco was
represented over 200 strong, and from
all parts of Sonoma County parties
came in vehicles of every description.
This was Mendocino and Lake counties'
day, and Â£\n excursion brought over 600
visitors from . Ukiah and way points.
They were so pleased with the display
that it is probable the railroad com
pany will be induced to run a second
excursion next Wednesday (Sonoma
day) from Ukiah, and thus on Wash
ington's birthday Sonoma and Mendo
cino, at one time one county, will be
reunited in a grand celebration over the
splendid fulfillment of past hopes and
prophecies.
This has been a summer day, the
thermometer registering 90 degrees.
To-night the gentle lady folk in their
summer, attire, their beauty enhanced
by myriads of vari-colored electric
lights "overhead, vied with the golden
fruits surrounding them ln making the
interior of the pavilion "a dream of
beauty and a Joy forever," while the
silvery rays of the moon outside and
the balmy breeze laden with the per
fume of the almond, the acacia and the
violet blooms reminded one of a mid
winter night in sunny Italy.
There was a promenade concert this
afternoon and evening by the Clover
dale band of sixteen pieces.
The art exhibit occupies a prominent
space, in charge of Mrs. L. I. Bird,
Mrs. C. E. Humbert and E. A. Cooley.
All the exhibits are of merit. Mrs. D.
M. Wambold shows a quilt made in
1838 and a pair of wedding slippers 120
years old. Herman Doden shows fancy
shell work which took the prize at the
Mechanic's Fair in San Francisco. Mrs.

" WHAT SHALL WE DO
WITH THE DEAD ?"
Serious Question That Now Disturbs the
London County Councilâ Cremation
the Only Remedy.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899,
by James Gordon Bennett.
? LONDON, Feb. 18.â "What shall we do with our dead?" is a question â¢
now agitating the minds of the members of the London County Council 1
| and others interested in the health of the living as well as the proper |
# disposal of the deceased. â¢
! Estimates show that each year about 150,000 human bodies are in- 1
9 terred within the limits of the county of London. The authorities say j.
L that within five years London will have no place for public burial, and Â©
Tthat within five cemeteries will have the imminent public burial, and #
the condition of the cemeteries suggests the imminent necessity of' some '
O change of method. .
I There is no doubt that great injury to public health has been caused I
0 by the burial grounds of the county. It has been stated that one-eighth â¢
iof the deaths in London are caused by disease which render their bodies I
y highly dangerous and infectious alter death. This condition is maximum y
jx a few weeks after decease, and In crowded cemeteries, where bodies are X
I frequently buried on top of or alongside of each other, the disturbance T
a of the earth for. new graves must be prejudicial to the health of the a
T neighborhood. The general opinion is that the only remedy is an ex- |

PRESIDENT
Â- OF FRANCE
Continued from First Page.
lery by counter cries of "A bas les Jes
uites." ~ - : - ''"' , *
Everybody seemed to be taking a
hand in the scene that was neither
creditable to their sense of their own
dignity or that of the nation. The
President looked up toward the press
tribune, where a violent altercation ap
peared to be taking place. He rang his
bell and motioned to the ushers to re
store order. As a matter of fact, it was
enough to have tolerated disturbances
on the floor of the house without being
compelled to look after the spectators.
At last things quieted down and the
voting continued monotonously, for
formal protests had been made by M.
Loubet's opponents. The letters of : the
alphabet 'were gone through # pretty
rapidly, the members of the upper and
lower chambers answering fairly regu
larly to the first calls of their names. -
At last the end is reached. The Presi
painted two excellent pictures for the
exhibit. H. P. Snyder has a veritable
curiosity shop of old relics and miner
alogical specimens. There are many
scenes in water colors.
Among the exhibitors of the Preston
display are Madam Preston, W. Ap
pleton, Henry Meyers, Dr. Hubbard
and T. J. Cottle. This is the most elab
orate exhibit of the fair.
The different booths are in line with
the general decorations. Each one is a
gem unto itself. Miss Sallie Criglor, a
dashing blonde, presides at the tamale
booth, ably assisted by two of Clover
dale's pretty budsâ Misses Adah Wil
liams and Essie Marshall. A charming
nook in the pavilion is the candy booth
in .charge of. Miss Maude Graham,
whose assistants are Misses Clara Gra
ham and Elfle McKoon. Mrs. J. R.
Vassar and Miss Mac Dobbins are in
charge of the orange booth, where
pretty baskets of luscious Cloverdale
oranges are sold to the visitor. The
Ladies' Guild of the Episcopal Church,
famous for Its excellent dinners at past
fairs, has charge of the lunch booth,
where all manner of delicacies are
served. Frank Yordi is the dispenser
of temperance liquids in another booth
tastily decorated. Miss Carver, repre
senting Proctor & Reynolds of Santa
Rosa, is selling the Sonoma County
Atlas in great numbers as an advertise
ment of Sonoma County. The dainty
booth where ice cream is served is un
der the direction of Mrs. F. W. Brush
and Mrs. T. B. Wilson. Mrs. Glendore
has a fish pond, where the susceptible
youth gets rid of his nickel to sport
with hook and line. .v-v-y
Mrs. T. J. de Hay has an excellent
display" In spiral form of jellies and
nuts. C. B. Smith has some enormous
vegetable y productions I on. exhibition.
Postmaster Baer's exhibit of apples,
deciduous fruits and "canned fruits is
quite an attraction. James* Shaw of
Sonoma has. a large plate of limes. He
has always taken the prize on limes.
J. A. Kleiser's large exhibit of olive oil
and pickled olives, made from his South
dent's gong sounded. Then he an
nounced that the list would be gone
through a second time, so that those
who failed to answer the call in the
first instance might vote.
This does not take long, and at 3
o'clock the second scrutiny Is finished.
The urns are emptied into baskets pre
pared to receive their contents, which
are carried off to be counted. The
President descends from the tribune,
not to ascend again to-day. The Dep
uties, press men and public pour out
into the corridors to get a breath of
fresh air.
"Le Roi est mort; vive le Roi," this
reflection came uppermost as the pub
lic streamed out < into . the magnificent
court yard and heard the waiting
crowds crying "Vive Loubet."
The spectacle over, everybody hur
ries to get back to Paris.
LOUBET'S ELECTION GREAT
REPUBLICAN VICTORY
Emily Crawford Describes the New
President's Qualities, Which Have
Endeared Him to France.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
PARIS, Feb. This election by a
single ballot and by Republicans only
is, the greatest Republican victory since
Grevy's walk over the course.
The new President comes from a part
of France '( where the Roman po wet
lasted longest, namely, Marsanne, in
the Department of the Drome. He
f .... I;"-: .;
Park olive grove near Cloverdale, is
the admiration of every visitor.
The large table filled to" overflowing
with the prize oranges of all kinds in
competition for prizes for the best
twelve is the leading attraction in the
pavilion. Such mammoth specimens
have never before been seen here.
J. G. Caldwell has an interesting ex
hibit of samples of genuine coal taken
from a vein on his Geyser Peak ranch.

gives the impression of remote Latin
origin and looks to be a solid, practical
man, who sees the facts of life just as
they are. As President of the Senate
he has had official and other experi
ence that will be useful to him as
President of the republic, but he is es
sentially a plain, middle-class man,
whose mind was sharpened by his prac
tice at the bar in the provincial town
of Montelimar, in the south of France.
He is there most popular and every
one at Montelimar counts himself a
personal friend of Loubet, who, as
Mayor, County Councilor, Deputy and
Senator, always acted as the servant
of the public. Obliging to his neighbors
he was : as accessible as General Grant
or Lincoln was and not less unpretend
ing. His thick-set figure, massive and
somewhtit Roman though homely head,
indicate a steady, sturdy character
who can nail his colors to the mast, but
only fight when there is good occasion.
He belonged, under the empire, to the
Republican party, then calling itself
Liberal. In 1870 he threw himself into
the national defense current and stood
by Gambetta. He was elected County
Councilor in 1871, then Mayor, and in
1876 was sent to the Chamber of Depu
ties, where he sat between MM. Henry
and Martin, the historian. Accepting
Thiers' leadership but. favoring the
scheme to declare Grevy his political
heir and to reconcile Gambetta with
both, he seemed to bide his time and
was in no hurry to push forward.
M. Loubet, for having formerly, when
Premier, sent jointly with the Foreign
Secretary, M. Rlbot, Admiral Cervais to
Cronstadt, is persona grata to Russia:
For three years, as Speaker in the Sen
ate, he lived in the Palace of the Petit
Luxembourg in much the same style as
the President lives in Washington. He
returned to .Paris from Versailles this
afternoon by train. He is the first
President who has done so. He or
dered an open carriage and pair to
await him at the station instead of a
carriage and four. He was well re
ceived by tremendous crowd 3. He ar
rived by daylight and had an escort of
cuirassiers. .The entire absence of
haughtiness in his demeanor was favor
ably remarked. [M. Loubet paid a visit
to Mme. Faure on his way home. - â  â¢
M. Loubet is the right man in the
right place. The importance of to-day's
Presidential election for the welfare of
the French republic and the prestige of
France cannot be overestimated. The
issue taken was whether the law should
be paramount or an irresponsible
leagueâ the League of the French
Fatherland in the hands of clerical,
monarchical and military agitators.
Never was a more monstrous con
spiracy engineered to pervert a whole
nation's sense of justice in order to per
petuate the greatest miscarriage of law
of the century and shield a few felons
from the consequences of crime. The
more sensible part of France feels after
M. Loubet's election that a great weight
has been taken off their conscience and
hopes that a new leaf will be turned
over the worst page of modern French
history.
M. Clemenceau wrote yesterday that
it was necessary that the new. Presi
dent should be a man not connected
with the Dreyfus affair. He would
therefore support M. Loubet. Fairness,
this, but the Nationalists do not want
fairness. They want Dreyfus, guilty
or innocent, to remain perpetually' at
Devil's Island. It was enough that M.
Clemenceau supported M. Loubet.
The Nationalists . declared that the
latter should not be President or they
would make Paris too hot for honest
people to live In. But suppose Loubet
were elected by a large -majority,
would they set their will above Con
gress? Yes, they were quite frank. It
was to be expected that DeÃeaurepaire,
that madman and story teller, would
rake up some falsehood against Loubet.
Sure enough, he published this morning
a Panama story against Loubet, if pos
sible, more empty than â¢ his charges
against the Court of Cassation. He
showed how little he himself believed
in his own tittle-tattle by admitting
that he doubted not Loubet's upright
ness, adding in a peculiar, dishonest
way, insinuations against M. Loubet
too fatuous for " contradiction.
The Libre Parole branded Loubet this
morning as a "Panama-Dreyfusite can
didate," having the effrontery to re
mark that he was supported as such by
Reinach, Zadac, Cahn. Chief Rabbi of
France, and by Dreyfus himself. The
Nationalist organs are forced to admit
that not a word or deed of M. Loubet
can be 'connected with Dreyfusism.
The fact is that the anti-Semites
heads have been turned by victories
due to the weakness of the Govern
ment, and they thought they could boss
France.. They won another victory
this morning, when Premier Dupuy,
yielding to anti-Semitic clamor, gave
Herr Frischaeur, the correspondent of
the Neve Freie Presse, notice of expul
sion from France. Herr Frischauer, an
Austrian, asked the reason,, and was
told that jit was .on account of the
. general tone of his letters on Dreyfus.
Dupuy, however, was unable to point to
a single unwarrantable passage in the
letters. ' vM / â 
M. Meline, through his shuffling and
double-dealing, caused the Dreyfus
drama to become a national crisis, and
derived the honor of being put forward
as a candidate by the Nationalists and
Monarchists, . the enemies of law and
order. Apparently he realized that it
was a doubtful compliment; declined,
wavered, accepted and declined last
night, to. the dismay of the National
ists; reaccepted this morning and half
declined in the afternoon. *
M. Loubet on his appearance in the
Congress house at Versailles was re
ceived with rounds of applause, a good
omen. By counting the hands that
clapped it could be seen that he had a
clear majority among the outside can
didates. It is signiUcent of the pres
ent yellow state of French opinion that
Colonel Monteil should offer himself
simply because he has slaughtered a
few negroes in West Africa.
Premier Dupuy replied to the Na
tionalist threats of street disturbances
by ordering troops in the barracks to
have their arms stacked in readiness
for every emergency. A~;
The lunch at the Hotel Reservoirs
was as lively as usual at a. Presidential
election. Many ladies in handsome
toilets were present. Champagne was
freely served and there was no trace
of mourning. Count Castellane was
glad to squeeze himself In a corner of
a table beside mine, and as other per
sons were drinking cheap wine he had
the discretion to order a small bottle
of cheap wine, too. After lunch all ad
journed to the Congress.
During the voting the Nationalists
attempted disorders. That nefarious
mountebank, De Roulede, mounted the
tribune and addressing M. Loubet. in
the chair, called him a Panamaist and
inquired what reply he would make to
M. de Beaurepaire's charges.
Loubet replied: "None. Your con
duct ls beneath my notice. Leav^ at
once that tribune."
M. Baudry Deuxason, a wealthy roy
alist landlord, noted for his eccentric,
freaks, while putting his paper in the
box cried "Vive le Roi!" but two Re
publican Deputies, who expected some
scene, quickly shoved him along.
At a little past 3 o'clock the news
was circulated in the lobby during a
brief adjournment that Loubet was
elected by 453 votes, against 279 for
Meline and 45 for Cavaignac.
When the sitting was resumed, M.
Loubet having given up the cnair to
the Deputy Chairman, the result was
announced and received with cheers on
the center and left, the right maintain
ing a sulky silence. Various cries were
heard, such as "Down with forgers!"
"Vive l'armee!" and "Down with the
Jews!" but all these cries were drowned
by the cheers for M. Loubet. It was
felt that France was returning to her
better self. '.; . 'AAA \y:: 'â 
Mr. Loubet. granted me an interview
to-night, in the course or which he
said: "I owe everything to the repub
lican majority. France and the repub
lic are inseparable. All the anti-re
publican opinions are free unless lead
ing to acts against the republic. The
allies must be judged by their acts, not
by their words. I shall govern in a re
publican sense only. I have given proofs
in my long political career that I am
neither a place-hunter, ambitious nor
overriding. Brought up in the study of
law, I will be its single-minded servant.
The Elysee is a post of duty. I speak
the truth in declaring that- I never was
ambitious to . go * there."
The Government shows its vigilance
to-night. If the Nationalists give
trouble all the worse for them. The
Central Brigade, 5000 strong, is on spe
cial duty and the troops are still under
arms in the barracks, but bands of
brawlers are, however, suffered to
march through the city crying. "Down
with Loubet," singing Deroulede's
Chauvinist songs and breaking win
dows.
The Duke of Orleans Is hovering
about the Franco-Italian frontier. I
have seen Prince Henry of Orleans
gathering impressions on the boule
vards. He is German-looking, with a
round, sunburned face, is tall, with a
short body, long legs and full, feminine
hips and has an awkward gait. The
city is fairly quiet and the diplomatic
world is satisfied with the election.
Russia approved It beforehand. The
people say Loubet is a "southern
Grevy."
The Nationalists have attempted to
carry out their threats and . scenes of
disorder took place to-day. Windows
were broken on the boulevards and
rioters were arrested in front of the
Elysee. The whole thing was done by
paid gangs. The rank and file of so
called patriots who marched through
the streets shouting "Confusion to Lou
bet," "Panama, Panama," and burning
his portraits, did not exceed 2000, with
a dozen ringleaders.
Premier Dupuy might have been
more prompt in maintaining order, as
he never failed to do while M. Faure
was President. But about II o'clock
he at length took steps and order was
restored without violence, and as if by
enchantment. How? Simply by block
ing a few hundred yards of the boule
vard for an hour in front of the Libre
Parole, which has been the hotbed of
sedition for some months.
If Dupuy loyally supports the new
President, the predictions of the pessi
mists that Loubet will meet the fate
of Casimir-Perler will be unfounded.
The present agitation is entirely arti
ficial.
An admirable passage in M. Loubet's
speech returning, thanks to the mem
bers of the Government has further ex
cited Nationalist rage. He says he is
for pacification, but with respect for the
law, implying that hitherto the law
had been trampled down. - â¢
The Nationalist papers this evening
declare war to the, knife on Loubet,
vowing they will never rest until they
have expelled him from the Elysee.
Jules le Maitre. founder of the League
of French Motherland, says he .will try
io get arrested for insulting M. Loubet,
as he Intends to do.
EMILY CRAWFORD.
WHERE WAS FAURE
WHEN TAKEN SICK?
NEW YORK. Feb. IS.â World
cable from Paris says: A remarkable
story obtains credence here that Presi
dent Faure, though he. died at the
Elysee Palace, was taken ill ,at the
house of actress Sorel. where he had
spent the afternoon with his private
secretary, .M. Le Gall.
The facts of that afternoon have not
been accurately accounted for, and
that Mme. Faure was not made aware
of his illness until 8 o'clock, no doubt
gave the basis for the rumor, coupled
with the President's known admira
tion for Sorel.

i.wlll act in conjunction with these three
gentlemen.'
* The. commission is an important one, as;
â¢It is allowed a large latitude, and the
. future policy of the Government in regard !
to the Philippines will be largely gov
. erned and possibly determined by its re- I
port.-
Cdlbnel Denby is particularly convers- I
ant with affairs In the Orient, and his
-* knowledge will serve him in good stead j
.in the investigations of the commission. j
â¢He-was' for thirteen years United States
' Minister to China, and will apply his !
â¢knowledge and experience to the present
problem, and in that way is expected to j
'bring about a solution satisfactory to )
both the Americans and the Filipinos.
His latest ' service to the Government
â¢was rendered as a member of the War
Investigating Commission, whicn recently
made a thorough examination of . the con- I
duct of the Spanish- American war. He
will sail for the Orient on the America :
Maru. which leaves this port on the 21st.
When seen last rieht Mr. Denby said:
'. "We are going to inquire into â¢ every
thing relating to the financial, educa- j
tional and other possibilities of the Phil
' ippines. We will do all in our power to |
pacify the Filipinos, but I am not at lib
erty "to publish our instructions in that
* - .connection. I don't know what we will
.â¢â . Â£.-,.. but we will do the best we can.
\ " Whether our report will determine the
â¢'â  policy of the administration in the gov- i
. â¢'ornment of the Islands I can not say. I
'-"do -not .think that President McKinley i
' '" -has as yet made up his mind as to what ;
l' " be Wants to do with the Philippines. He i
â  - will depend to a large extent upon Con- !
â¢ ..... cress to settle whether it shall be a colo- j
' hyor whether we will establish a protec
"V .torate. We can only hold the Philippines j
.'â¢ . tv military force.
* -' * "If- I â¢ had been asked the ouestlon a
. ' -month ago should we hold the Philippines '
â¢â¢ J. would have said emphatically yes. but
.""â¢â '.-now? that I am restricted by my official j

3 years old, at the California Theater,

one has . ? en the sole bread-winner of
the family. When she works the cup-'
board is filled. Just as when her dis
tinguished grandfather labors, the sa
loons are comparatively empty.
Venle has not been working much
of late. Local productions do not call
for child talent. Therefore, Venie's
home Is desolate, and her mother and
her little brother are suffering the keen
pangs of ' want.
Venie's mother, is an actress also. Her
ability, however, is of a special order,

SHE MUSTERED OUT
WITH HER SOLDIER
THE LADY OF THE EIGHTH
CALIFORNIA.
Isaac Belknap of Vancouver, the
Husband of the Runaway-
Woman, Seeking Her.
Isaac Belknap, in the employ of the
United States at Vancouver barracks, was
on the water front yesterday in search
of his runaway wife. He does not care
so much about the return of the woman,
but he does want to recover his 6-year-old
child.
All went well in the Belknap household
until the Eighth California boys marched
into Vancouver. J. H. Williams, one of
their number, was a fine singer, and soon
became a regular attendant at the Meth
odist church of that place. Mrs. Belknap
was a church member, and belonged to
the choir, and she and Williams met and
became good friends. When the Eighth
was disbanded Williams returned' to San
Francisco, and last Tuesday Mrs. Belknap
followed him. ?-,--(.--.^
"Tuesday last, while I was away on
business," said Belknap yesterday, "my
wife disappeared. She took the train to
Portland, Or., and when I followed her
there I found that she had joined Wil
liams and that they had gone on to San
Francisco. While I was away a female
friend of Mrs. Belknap got into my house
and packed all her clothes and jewelry
into a box and .shipped It to San Fran
cisco. I followed It. and with the aid of
Officer Charles Callaghan of the harbor
police I located it in the baggage-room at
the ferry depot this morning. If my wife
or Williams comes for the trunk I hope to
catch them and so secure the return of
my child. I don't want the woman. Her
treachery has ruined my home and spoiled
my life, and she can go." .Â»"â¢-'-
Belknap has Private Detective Macfar
lane on the trail of the runaway couple,
and hopes to locate them soon.
NEW "WAYS" WORK WELL.
Yachtsmen Busy Scraping Spars and
Overhauling Their Craft.
The directors of the San Francisco
Yacht Club are planning considerable im
i provement in the rooms on the upper
floor of their house, the walls and ceil
ing of which are at present in the rough.
The billiard room is to be divided into two
roomsâ a sitting room and a billiard room.
The celling and walls are to be finished
with tongue and grooved pine, which will
be covered to a height of seven feet with
dull green burlap; above will be a frieze
of some bright color, In the corners of
the billiard room will be permanent red
wood settees stained in dark oak color.
Besides the billiard table there will be ta
bles for writing and card playing. The
finishing of the interior of the dance hall
will be deferred until later. A wide open
archway may be left between the billiard
room and the dance hall, or the two
apartments may be separated by sliding
doors. . . . â.
The club has now nearly a hundred
subscribing members, but about 150 are
needed to furnish the income necessary
to carry on the club succesfully and w th
out economizing unduly In any direction.
The first yacht to be hauled out on
the club "ways" is Dr. A. W. McKen
zie's Sappho, which was taken up with
ease, the ways working very well. The
sloop will be thoroughly overhauled and
jftit into first-class condition. Some of
the yacht owners are already beginning
to scrape and paint their craft for the
approaching season The large schooner
Ae-eie is lying to the north of the ferry

Catherine are in the cove near the Pa
cific Yacht Clubhouse, which li nog

a meeting of yacht- owners will be held,
.at which a Programme of even for the
season will be prepared. It will be sub
ject to change by the directors. â¢ â¢ â

know how to express to you my thanks
for your interest in my humble efforts
and your good wishes and kindness for
my future. I am very proud that I
am a Californian, and my visit here
will always remain one of the happiest
and most memorable events of my life,
and I shall try to maintain the high
position which you have so generously
assigned. With the kind co-operation
of Messrs. Gottlob & Co., I am enabled
to name the week of the 27th Inst., at
the California Theater. Please accept
my gratitude and, believe me, I shall
never forget your kindness to me.
Very sincerely, NANCE O'NEIL.,
BUNKO MEN FLEECE .
GUILELESS GUESTS
GET TOUR VICTIMS FROM ONE
HOTEL.
Dr. F. Scanlan Parted With Much
Coin in a Card Game With Four
Confidence Operators.
A clever gang of bunko men is now
operating around the hotels, and though
proprietors have appealed to the police to
protect their too confiding guest:*- nothing
has been done as yet in that direction.
The "sure thing" men ply their vocation
witn more or less success. _'':VL" ,
The latest victim was Dr. F. Scanlan.
formerly surgeon on the Moana. who re
cently registered at the California Hotel,
and the day after his arrival parted with
"fifty-one pounds sterling." His tale of
woe follows: â Â, 'â â â â ;
"I was approached by an affable gen
tleman, who represented himself as Mr.
Benson of the Southern Pacific Company.
After a little talk he told me he had some
Klondike nuggets which he would like to
show me. I expressed a desire to see
them, and he took me to a room at 313
Kearny street. When we got there a
game of poker was going on, in which
a handsome man whom they called
"Judge." Mr. Davis, a business appear
ing man with sore eyes, and a slender lit
tle fellow, were engaged, and to whom I
was introduced. Benson took a hand and
won several dollars and passed me over
half of It, telling me to play. I did so,
and in the deal got three sevens. Benson
said it was a splendid hand, and I left
them and went to the hotel to- get my
money, fifty-one pounds, and came back
and played it. Benson made a side bet of
$300 with one of the party and we lost,
the other man having four eights. j
"Upon my telling them it was all I had
they asked me to take my money back,
but I refused, saying I was satisfied I had
lost it fairly. Knowing the character of
the men now, I have changed my mind.
Benson gave me $15 and promised to give
me back half what I lost, but of course I
have never seen him since."
Another guest at the same hotel named
A. B. Jackson lost $15 to the same gang
by shaking dice, the steerer in this in
stance professing to have some Colorado
nuggets.
Still another guest, Fulton by name, lost
$30 at dice, but the "Judge"., handed him
back $20, so his experience cost him but
$10.
The fourth guest was a traveling agent
from St. Louis, A. Behal. He went up
against the card game at 230 Kearny
street, but after he had won $30 he began
'to realize that It was a case of bunko and
he played until he lost the coin, being
glad to escape at that.
The hotel proprietors are up in arms
against the confidence game and will take
radical measures to protect any unso
phisticated guests who may register at
their caravansaries. Detective Wren has
been on the cases, and he believes he has
located the precious quartet of "sure
thing" men.
UNEASY OVER
HAWAIIAN BILL
Little Time Left for Its
Consideration.
ENACTMENT IS NECESSARY
LAWS NEEDED TO GOVERN THE
NEW TERRITORY.
Unless Congress Takes Action at This
Session Embarrassments of a
Serious Nature Will Re ~*>-
the Result.
Special DUpatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House.
Washington, Feb. 18.
Members of the House who are inter
ested in the passage of the bill provid
ing a form of government for Hawaii
are manifesting concern at the status
of that measure. With but twelve legis
lative days of this session remaining
and with such a large amount of public
business pressing for attention it is felt
that action upon the bill is doubtful.
The necessity for the enactment of
laws to cover conditions existing in
Hawaii Is admitted on all sides. Even
the Democratic minority, who oppose
some features of the bill, which has
been reported to the House and Is
awaiting right of way from the Com
mittee on Rules, concede the desirability
of putting the bill upon passage. They
will endeavor to amend it to conform
to their views, but failing in this will
not prevent its final passage.
Important questions are arising in
Hawaii concerning immigration and
maritime affairs, and at the present
there is no competent court of jurisdic
tion to pass upon them. It is true that
the House has passed a bill extending
the alien contract labor laws of the
United States over Hawaii, but the bill
does not provide for the execution of
these laws nor furnish a court in which
a violation can be prosecuted. With
rapidly increasing i commerce between
the States and the new territory and
vexatious questions if the shipping
laws of the United States as proposed
be extended to Hawaii, the same
trouble as to a court of final resort for
their execution and construction exists.
Chairman Knox of the Committee on
Territories and Chairman Hltt of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, the
latter a member of the late Hawaiian
Commission and thoroughly conversant
with the situation in Hawaii, have been
untiring in their efforts during the past
week to secure the recognition of the
bill. They have succeeded to the extent
of securing a promise from the Com
mittee on Rules to consider early next
week the practicability of reporting a
rule giving time to the bill. It is said
that If this Congress adjourns without
furnishing a form of government for
Hawaii, and the matter goes over until
next winter, embarrassments of a se
rious nature and extent will result-. in
Hawaii. ______J \-' - ' I

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEVENTY MILE RIVER, Alaska,
Dec. 20 (via Seattle. Feb. 18).â Lee
Plate, Julius Sternberg and J. A. Rit
chie of Montreal have returned from an
unsuccessful effort to relieve a party of
prospectors at the head of Porcupine
Rive^ They were gone over six weeks
and suffered partial starvation, as they
took provisions for thirty days only.
For six days they were practically
without food. All the snowshoe lac
ings and spare skins were fed to their
dogs. '-AAAyf
Ritchie, who led the party, was a
member of the party that was to have
been rescued. It consisted of Ritchie.
D. A. McPhee of Winnipeg, Ray Mof
fatt of Pembroke, Ont.. Philip Billneau
of Duluth and Andre Holmes of
Fresno, Cal. They went over the Ed
monton route, and last fall found them-:
selves at the headwaters of the Porcu
pine River too late to descend in boats.
Without a guide they started across
country to the Yukon 200 miles
away. Holmes' feet were frozen at
the outset. Believing himself unable to
continue, the journey -he decided to go
into carap'-at Fish Branch on the up*
per Porcupine and trust to getting
enough salmon through a hole -in the
ice to keep off starvation until help
should come. Moffatt and Billneau re
mained with Holmes.
Ritchie and McPhee with four dogs
pushed on for relief. In five days their
food gave out and they were reduced
to the necessity of toasting five beaver
hides and eating -them one after an
other. At the end of ten days they
reached a cabin at the mouth of Big
Sheep . Creek, where they found Pate
and Sternberg. Pate, Sternberg and
Ritchie started in a few days to relieve
Holmes and his companions. They
found the camp at Fish Branch, where
Moffatt had left- a note saying that
they had been unable to replenish their
supply of game and fish, and, fearing
that assistance might be delayed in
reaching them, had decided to attempt
the return trip to Lapierre House, some
200 miles down the Porcupine. Ritchie
thinks they were able to make the trip,
though they started j with so little food
that they probably would have to eat
some of their dogs, of which they had
three. __^_______^___

DIVISION COMMANDER
IS OUT IN THE COLD
WITHDRAWAL OF HIS NOMINA
; TION CREATES SURPRISE.
In Case of Need the Command of the
. Guard Will Devolve on Brig
adier General Warfield.
The only matter that has attracted the
attention of those Interested in National
Guard affairs during the past week has
been ' the action of Governor Gage ln
withdrawing the nomination of John H.
.Dick., son as major general of the guard,
. to which position he was appointed dur
ing the interim between the adjournment
of the previous Legislature and the ses
sion of the present one. The nomination
was not confirmed by the Senate.
. *In explanation of the withdrawal of
this- and other nominations which were
riot confirmed the Governor has said
that he could not be expected to approve
â¢the unconfirmed appointments of another
â¢to' positions for public office. There are
"those who are of the opinion that the
withdrawal of the name of Major General
Dickinson means that he ls to be shelved i
and that he will not be renominated for !
â the office. They base their conclusion on '
..the' bill that Senator Dickinson introduced :
in the Senate for the reorganization of j
the guard. That bill has a provision which i
â¢would, if adopted as presented, virtually
.'make the major general the head of the
guard and make the adjutant general sub
-ordinate to him and even curtail to a cer
tain extent the prerogative of the com- :
mander in chief, and they believe that !
because of this bill the Governor has de- j
termined that in case the power alluded
to should be given It is not to go to Dlck^
loson. There are others who feel quite ;
confident that Dickinson will be reap- I
pointed. If that should come to pass it
would be quite a surprise, but the Gov- \
ernor is a man of many surprises, so that ]
almost anything may be looked for.
â¢Whatever may be done, there is now no
division commander, the division head- j
quarters are closed and the adjutant gen
eral's office is for the time being the head
of the guard, and all communications go
there now Instead of to division headquar
ters. â¢In case of trouble, however, and
should there be need for what there la
of the guard in the State, General War
field, who is the senior brigadier general,
would be in command.
Nd action is being taken in regard to
the companies that are still in and those
that want to get in, for all are waiting
for something to be done at Sacramento, I
but when that will be no one can now 1
presume to tell. _ _. .

OBEYED THEIR PARENTS.
Otto E. yon Rhein Files Suit for Di
vorce Against His Wife, as
Predicted.
As was predicted in The Call of yester
; day, Otto E. yon Rheln, son of the well
known real estate dealer, filed an action
for divorce yesterday against his wife,
. Ida A., on the ground of desertion.
A romantic story hinges on the separa
| tion of the young couple, who were se
i cretly united in marriage. The fair de-
I fendant was formerly Miss Ida A. Son,
daughter of A. A. Son, the well-known
; merchant. When the announcement of
her engagement to Mr. yon Rheln was
: made ln October, 1897, her parents showed
a disposition to oppose the match. In
their effort to thwart the young couple's
purpose they decided to send their daugh
ter abroad; but Cupid discovered the plan
and a secret marriage was decided upon,
and within a few weeks after the engage- j
ment they were clandestinely united.
Mrs. yon Rhein's parents believed they
had nipped their daughter's hopes when
they sent her to Europe the same month,
but the secret marriage became known.
The parents of the pair met and decided
that a dissolution of the marriage bonds
was the proper thing, a"d the filing of the
suit yesterday was the result. Mrs. yon
Rheln came back to this city last Febru
ary, but did not return- to her husband. :
It is said she will not oppose the suit.
CHARTER WILL TAKE
EFFECT NEXT JANUARY
CITY ATTORNEY LANE SO IN
FORMS SUPERVISORS.
; Question Was Raised by Tax Collec
tor Sheehan in His Controversy
With the Board.
The new charter has not gone into ef
fect, and will not until January 1, 1900.
This question was raised by Tax Collector
, Sheehan before the Supervisors some
time since, when he was applying for
funds with which to conduct his office.
He asked for an increased appropriation
on the ground that the duties of License
Collector had devolved upon him.
The matter was referred to City and
County Attorney Lane, and he submitted
a written opinion to the Supervisors yes
terday. The attorney quotes at length
from the State constitution in support of
his findings, tie says he finds nothing in
the constitution in conflict with the ex
press provision of the charter postponing
the time of its operation until January 1
next. It might go into effect immediately
upon Its approval by the Legislature if
the charter did not itself expressly or im
pliedly fix any other date upon which It
was to take effect.
In closing, he says: "I therefore advise
that the new charter is not now in opera
tion, except for the purposes of an elec
tion to be held in November next, and.,
further, that for general purposes it does
not go Into effect until January 1, 1900.

ACROSS THE BAY.
Burglars, Petty Thieves and Other
Lawbreakers Placed Out of
Mischief for Years.
The criminal departments of the Su
perior Court held their monthly sentence
day yesterday and luckless law-breakers
were hastened out of the way of temp
tation.
Judge Carroll Cook occupied the morn
ing by presenting stiff sentences to the
criminals brought before him. James
Murray and Michael Brogan, convicted of
burglary of the first degree, were award
ed two and four years, respectively, in
San Quentin. Frank Ricardo withdrew
his plea of not guilty, and admitted hav
ing passed a fictitious instrument on
Goldberg, Bowen & Co. He was given one
year in San Quentin. Ricardo had a thirst
for champagne and he tried to satisfy it
by forging the name of the secretary of
the Cosmos Club to an order calling for
ten bottles of dry wine. Ho was caught
in his attempt, and now. his aristocratic
tastes will have to give way to cold water
within the walls ot the famous prison.
John Maloney, charged with an assault
on Charles Calliotos, was sentenced to
three months in the County JaiL William
McLaughlin' and John McShay, who were
captured in the act of breaking into tho
residence of John Schumacher, corner of
Second and Folsom streets, were ordered
sent to the Whittier Reform School, as
they were too young to be dealt harshly
with. A. Hendricks, who was convicted of
stealing a diamond and a sum of money
from a May Adams, was given a year's
rest in San Quentin. ,:,.â¢-;-.:-..,..
Judge Dunn inflicted heavy â  sentences
on John Worthard and Louis Alvarez for
criminal work, Worthard was given seven
years in . San Quentin and Alvarez the
same number at Folsom.
Judge William P. Lawler ordered
Frank Cevera, alias Krank Lagan, and
James Kelly sent to the Whittier Reform
School. The latter, who is an incorrigi
ble, was placed there at the request of
his brother James, who wishes him kept
out of mischief -until he reaches his
majority.
A GIRL BURGLAR.
Amelia Tierney Admits Breaking In
to a House to Get Money for
Her Lovers.
The preliminary examination of Andrew
Costello, an ex-convict, on tho charge of
burglary for breaking into the house of
Mrs. Jessie McLeod, 1414 Kearny street,
was held before Acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday, and an extraordinary state of
affairs was disclosed.
Mrs. Margaret Tierney and her daugh
ter Amelia, 14 years of age, were also
arrested on the same, charge, and the
girl admitted on the stand yesterday that
she alone committed the burglary. Cos
tello and a companion, Victor Marchand,
were her lovers, and on the day of the
burglary Costello said to her, "Say, go
and get me some money." She knew that
Mrs. McLeod was not at home, so she
went to a rear window, broke the glass
and crawled through the window. She
went to Mrs. McLeod's bedroom and stole
$20, a watch, three rings, a bracelet and
other articles. After committing the
burglary she gave Costello $5 and Mar
chand $4, and also gave each one of the
rings she had stolen. Neither Costello
nor Marchand knew where she had got
the money and rings.
The girl's mother testified that Mar
chand gave her the ring which was found
in her room. Marchand and Costello both
denied that they knew anything about- the
burglary, and the Judge came to the con
clusion that the charge of burglary
against Costello could not stand. He re
manded the two boys into custody until
to-morrow, to see. if they could be held
for receiving stolen property, and released
Mrs. Tierney on her own recognizance. i
Amelia was sent back to the Magdalen j
Asylum.
MONEY OF THE INSANE.
Lunacy Commission Asks That It \ Be
Handled by Proper Authorities. %
Secretary John F. Carrere, of the State
Commission In Lunacy, has addressed a
communication to the Supervisors, calling
their attention to the: disposal of money
found on the persons of insane . patients
taken to the City Receiving Hospital.
It has been the custom- to deliver it to
friends of the unfortunates or to others
on order of court. . . ; : ;.
Commissioner Carrere quotes an. opin
ion of Attorney General Tirey L. Ford, in
which that official says the money should
properly be delivered to the Sheriff and
by him turned over to the State Hospital
authorities. He asks the board to Instruct
the â¢ superintendents of Insane wards to
comply with the law.
Japs Admitted to Bail. j
The eleven Japanese, arrested at the In
stigation of Deputy Immigration Com- ;
missioner Geffeney, were admitted to bail
? by United States Commissioner Heacock
' yesterday, in the sum of $250 each. Bert
I Schlesinger, their attorney, will interpose
: the defense that they. had no Intention of â¢-.
i bribing Mr. Geffeney. but thought that
the $5. which they openly handed him;- was â¢
, a tax imposed upon immigrants by ; the â 
Government. ' â¢
Burglar Gallick.
Simon Gallick was yesterday held to an*
swer before the Superior Court by Judge
Graham on a charge of burglary, in $2000
bonds.: He broke into the rooms of Mme.
Cazeaux. 404 Ellis street, ; and was dis
covered by her. He ran and was pursued
by Policeman Murphy, who fired a shot
at him. The fugitive was caught on Lar
kin street by Policeman Phillips.

IN THEIR RACE TO EUREKA.

Officers â of tho
Sealing Fleet.
A very interesting race from San Fran
cisco to Eureka will begin to-day. For
some time past the schooners Occidental
and Fortuna have been rivals. First one
vessel has made a good run and then the
other, so now the captains have decided
to set all doubts at rest. Both schooners
will be towed to Lime Point, where they
will be cast off and will then make their
way to Eureka as quickly as wind and
sails will carry them. A : â.*.,-?_
Captains Brandt and Rosich are old
friends, having been shipmates years ago
in the Occidental. Captain Brandt left
the schooner to become master of the old
steamer Humboldt. One day when pass
ing out over the Humboldt bar a big sea
swept over the steamer and Brandt was
washed into the scuppers and had his leg
broken. The break was such a serious
one that the bones would not knit and the
limb had to be amputated in order to save
the captain's life.
While Captain Brandt was on the Hum
boldt Captain Rosich -was made mate of
the Occidental and later captain of the
Fortuna. After the Humboldt . was lost
and Captain Brandt recovered from his
sick spell ho was given his old position
on the Occidental. He is confident that
his vessel can beat Captain Roslch's, but
it should be a very close affair. The two
captains have only a new hat bet on the
event, but Jerry Daily and Will Downs
of the Merchants' Exchange have wag
ered a toothsome dinner on the outcome.
The guests are to be limited to a dozen,
of which four are to be newspapermen,
and the repast is not to cost more than
$30. Daily is backing the Occidental and
Downs the Fortuna. '
The battleship lowa will be open for in
spection to-day, and arrangements have
been made to handle a big crowd. This
will probably be. the last chance for some
time to see the big fighting machine, as
she will. In all probability, go to the Mare
Island navy yard next Wednesday or
Thursday. Yesterday the supply steamer
Celtic came down from the yard at low
water. She was drawing 21 feet, and as
the lowa only draws 24 feet, there should
be no difficulty ln getting her up to the
island. Considerable repair work has to
be done, and her engines are to be over
hauled, so It will be some time before
she Is seen In the stream again. â¢
All kinds of craft will carry passengers
to the battleship to-day. Henry Peter
eon has made arrangements to handle a
big crowd. Nearly everybody who pur
chased tickets from him last Sunday and
failed to get aboard the. warship were
taken out last Wednesday. Should there
be any of the tickets still outstanding
they will be honored to-day. Peterson
will run the launches Amy, William D.
and Petrel from the Folsom street float,
and ' the steamer Caroline from Fol
som street wharf. A float has been placed
alongside. the lowa so the crowds will be
handled easily and quickly, both going
and coming. - . 'Â -. _ .^' ..

surprised to learn of the sudden de
mise of the popular young man and
his wife, both of whom were asphyxiat

hotel in Ardsley-on-Hudson. N. V.. last
Monday night. .
On the evening mentioned Mr. and
Mrs. Keyes attended a barn dance at
that resort given by Colonel Eugene
Criffin of the First United States Vol
unteer Engineers. After the dance-Mr.
and Mrs. Keyes drove to the Ardsley
Casino, where they had secured accom
modations for the: night, and. retired.
Through a defective gas jet they were
both asphyxiated and were found the
next morning by the servants. - quite
dead. - â¢ â¢ -A : ':.
Henry Elmo Keyes was only 29 years
of age. He -was a professor of chem
istry, having taken high degrees in
Germany, was formerly instructor in
the school of mines of Columbia Uni

General Keyes, the father, was well
known in San Francisco, where he was
stationed before the civil war, in which
he commanded a division of the Federal

ROD AND LINE.
Fishermen on Fishermen's .Wharf
Are Selling Small Bass Con
trary to Law.
Steelhead fishing on Russian River has
shown no marked improvement since last
week. A few spent fish are caught occa
sionally by anglers who . are bountifully
supplied with leisure moments... :>': A, ?.-
The large run of fishes which local
anglers had hopes of anticipating when
the bar at the mouth of the river was
opened by employes of the railroad did
not delay on the order of going, but left
in double quick haste when the first heavy
rains swelled the flow of water to old
ocean. . ' * â¢ A : 'A-AAA]
Thousands of fish reached their spawn
ing grounds in good season, and in all
probability the streams that empty into
Russian River will have a plethoric, sup
ply of little fish next summer. It is ex
tremely doubtful whether anglers â¢* will
have an opportunity of enjoying anything
like sport this yearâ that is, as far "as
fresh run steelheads In Russian River are
concerned. ? .;
At Point Reyes there are hopes of a
late run of fishes. In fact, quite a few
steelheads were seen last* Sunday in? the
pool near the White House, but they re
fused to acknowledge all kinds of lures.
Striped bass are also in evidence at Point
Reyes; but, like the steelheads, they are
on the sulk. Possibly the anglers have
not tempted them with the kind of bait
that may tickle their fancy. A nice fat
clam properly placed may cause a flurry
ln the pools where Mr. Bass ls at present
enjoying undisturbed peace.
Among the sportsmen and anglers who
returned last Sunday on the train to this
city from Point Reyes and other points
where sport is to be had in season were
R. Terry, C. Brandenstein. J. Butler (or
"Tule , Chops") , H. C. . Muller, F. Vernon,
"Biddy" Walker (alias "June Bug"), O.
Feudner. A. Coutts. F. Battu, C. Precht,
C. Johnson, F. Dolllver, J. Sammi, Fish
Commissioners Babcock and * Vogelsang,
W. Mansfield, D. Cooper and Handy
Andy.
Quite a number of- expert anglers will
leave to-day for Point Reyes for the pur
pose of trying their skill In the capture
of striped bass.
On Thursday morning, about 10 o'clock,
several wagons drove on Fishermen's
wharf, and, not seeing any danger ahead,
the. drivers deliberately set to work filling
their boxes with small striped bass that
averaged half a pound in weight. The
fish were purchased, from the net fisher
men, who had also a large supply of her
rings in their boats. .-: Bass over three
pounds in weight â¢ were not sold, - but
thousands of little bass were carted from
the wharf to uptown hotels and restau
rants. Possibly Mr. Babcock, chief, of the
Fish Commission, will look into the mat
ter sooner or later.

Will Bring Him Back.
An effort was made yesterday to serve
summons on L. S. Megginson in the suit
filed on Friday by J. F. Turner to recover
$144,600 ! worth of property, but without
success, and it is thought that he has left
the State.
Turner says he has had the house in
which Megginson lived watched for the
last ten days, and has arrived at the con
clusion that Megginson has- left the city
for parts unknown. â¢ Turner says if he
finds that Megginson has departed .and
he cannot reach him to serve him he will
next week swear out the warrant on one
of the four charges of perjury he has
against Megginson arid will at once ask
the aid of Chief Lees to have him brought
back to this city. He will then be placed
where he can be found when wanted.
Turner says he has been told Meggin
son was in the State of Nevada the first
day of this week, but upon reading The
Call of the 13th Inst, he at once started
East, and It is thought he has gone to
the home of his brother in Ohio.

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant. Simple, but Baf. and Ef-
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of stomach has long been con-
sidered the next thing to incurable. The
usual symptoms are a full or bloating i
sensation after eating, accompanied some-
times with sour or watery risings, a for-
mation of gases, causing pressure on the
heart, and lungs and difficult breathing;
headaches, fickle appetite, nervousness
and a general played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the mouth,
coated tongue and if the interior of the
stomach could be seen it would show a
slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure of this common and obstinate
trouble is found . In a treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment
and irritate the delicate mucous surfaces
of the' stomach. To" secure a prompt and
healthy digestion is the one necessary
thing to do and when normal digestion is I
secured the catarrhal condition will have
disappeared. 1 *>-â¢-? ?
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed, of. Diastase, Asep-
tic Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden Seal and
fruit acids. These tablets can now be found
j at air drugstores under the .name of Stu-
; art's Dyspepsia Tablets, and not being a
| patent medicine can be used with perfect
safety, and assurance? that healthy appe-
tite and thorough:. digestion will follow
their regular use after meals.
' Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn St..
Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh is a local
condition resulting from a neglected cold
in the head, whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge.. therefrom pass-
ing * backward into the : throat reaches
the stomach, " thus producing ca-
tarrh of v the stomach. Medical â '. au-
thorities prescribed y for me for -three
years for catarrh of the stomach without
cure, but to-day I am the happiest of men
after using only one box of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I cannot find appropriate
words to express my good feeling. -I have
found flesh, appetite and sound rest from '
their use." â }: AA: *
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets ts the safest !
preparation as well as the simplest and ;
most convenient remedy for any form of
indigestion, catarrh of the stomach, bil-
iousness, sour stomach, heartburn . and
bloating after meals.

IN THE 6RIP EPIDEMIC â¢
Special Use of Hot Grogs
BY
Dr. GYRUS EDSON
â¢ of New-York' Health Departmsnt, and
Dr. LIBERMANN,
Surgeon General of the French Army.
H. Libermann, M. D., surgeon gen-
eral of the French army, in an article .
on "La Grippe" (Influenza), recom-
mends the following hot grog: "One-
third goblet. of Yin Mariani, with two-
thirds boiling water, cloves and cinna-
mon, and with or without sugar, makes
a grog of exquisite flavor, which pro-
duces immediate beneficial effect in se-
vere cases of cold, attended by convul-
sive coughing and depression. It is
best taken at bedtime. In the grip .
epidemics in France it was the tonic
absolutely relied upon, and has re- -
ceived frequent deserved mention in
the medical press. It has been shown
that patients recover very slowly.
There is much general weakness and
lassitude invariably calling for some-
thing in nature of a mild tonic stimu-
lant, and it has been found that Ma-
rian! Wine is unequaled for such
cases." ' A-"';" a
Dr. Cyrus Edson of the New York
Health Department has made a careful
study of the subject in his book on "La
Grippe," published by Appleton & Co.
On page 39 he writes of Yin Mariani
and calls special attention to it in the
form of a hot grog. . In speaking of the
complete' prostration accompanied by
the depression caused by this disease,
and also . during entire convalescence,
his preference for a tonic stimulant is
a hot grog of Yin Mariani. He says it
is excellent for the purpose intended,
and recommends its use freely. The .
remedy is simple and within easy reach
of all who suffer from this dreaded dis- :
ease. . * ; Af
A book with further explicit details
will be sent by Mariani & Co., 5* West *
Fifteenth street, New York, to any one .
who will write requesting same. It is
certainly well worth writing for.
In addition to the able authorities
quoted, the book offered contains many .
more similar and most convincing in- â¢

WEARY RIDE OF
SIX-DAY CYCLERS
ENDS TO-NIGHT
Miller Now Seems a
Certain Winner.
FAR AHEAD OF THE RECORD
SENSATIONAL PERFORMANCES
OF ELKES AND MICHAEL.
The Former Rides Five Miles in Mar
velous Time and the '.'Rare
bit" Goes a Mile in
1:51 1-5. j
Riders on the verge of dementia pro
pelled themselves around the bicycle track
at Mechanics' Pavilion all yesterday, with
agony depleted on their drawn and hag
gard* features. To say they were riding
Slowly would be true only in a compara
tive sense, as the leader has covered near
ly two hundred miles more than any hu
man machine has ever traveled In the
same period of time. The brutal contest
Is nearly at an end, the alloted time ln
â which the men are to ride being up at 11
o'clock to-night.
This race, the most brutal that human
Ingenuity has up to the present time been
able to devise, may go down in history as
the last of Its kind. The veteran handlers
of the men say It ls not likely the per
formance will ever be equaled, It so out
classes anything ever held before. . The
riders In their lucid moments say the
-train has been a cruel one, and that they
have had all they want of the six-day
game. . The majority of them are mental
and physical wrecks, and it will be some
lime before they recover from the awful
strain to which they have subjected
themselves for a mere pittance.
The short-distance races which are run
while the track is full of the weary wob
blers are a treat to watch. Harry Elkes
and Michael were the stars last night,
both riding fast exhibitions. Elkes rode
five miles, each of which was negotiated
at a 1:53 clip. Michael reeled oft his
fastest mile, going the distance In 1:51 1-5.
The vagaries of the long-distance riders'
disordered minds present humorous
phases that are at once grim and pitiable.
Poor Fredericks, the Swiss, has had more
than his share of them. Shortly after
6 o'clock yesterday morning his trainers
missed him from the track and went in
quest of him. They learned that he dis
mounted unobserved and made his way j
around through the training quarters and
out to the other side of the track. When ;
they tried to urge him out on the track
he demurred in broken English. When
this was finally translated it was found
that he thought men were racing about
on tandems and he wanted to wait until
they were through. He was finally con
vinced that there was no danger on that
score, and resumed his painful journey.
Last night Fred Carter, an employe In
one of the booths In the Pavilion, walked
across the track just where the collision
occurred the night before between Law
eon and Marx. Fredericks was the vic
tim tills time. He struck Carter and was
thrown high in the air. He fell head fore
most among a pile of empty bottles,
breaking a lot of them. He was unable to â 
continue fer a time, but later on resumed j
his wheel.
During the evening Albert became fas
tidious and demanded a pair of kid gloves.
He would not ride unless - these were
forthcoming, but once they were produced
he donned them and went on his way
happy in possessing them. Barnaby had
a number of bad half-hours during the
evening. Twice he rode high on the banks
and grasping the rail remained suspended
' until rescued from his perilous position.
Once he rode down on the floor and, dis
mounting, started to ride the reverse way
of the track. He wanted to unwind him
self.
Pllkington fell asleep on his wheel dur
ing the evening and crashed Into Ashing
er and some trainers who were standing
near the edge of the track. Ashlnger was
more troubled that hurt. He had Just en-
Joyed a hearty stand-up luncheon and
the jar settled it more rapidly than he
desired. He seemed to enjoy his lunch
eon, as he stood at the cooking table for
over a half hour helping himself to every
thing in sight with both hands. He
scorned to sit down, preferring to stand
where he could survey the substantial
spread before him.
A number of the men were presented
with bouquets of flowers and Barnabv's
trainers, not to be left in the discard.
improvised a bouquet out of a bunch of
celery. He carried this proudly for some
time before he learned its true charac
ter. When he did so he ate it.
Harry Elkes, the American champion
middle-distance rider, broke the five mile
world's paced record last evening, follow-
Fournier's machine. Fournier, by the
way, lessened the weight of his motor
cycle fourteen pounds yesterday, by put
ting on lighter rims and tires: It now
weighs 135 pounds. The difference was
noticeable in this Increased speed. He
carried Elkes along steadily for each one
of the five miles at a 1:53 clip, the total
â¢ time being 9 minutes 24 seconds for the
five miles. Elkes is in such beautiful con
dition that McFarland will have to look
well to himself in their match next Wed
nesday night, at fifteen miles, paced, or
he will be beaten.
Jimmy Michael, the world's middle-dis
tance champion, also lowered his mile
record made on the track to 1:51 1-5, paced'
by Fournier. In Michael's case It was tne
same as with Elkes. They are able to
follow almost any pace set for them, and
the faster the Frenchman can go the fast
pr will be their time. The people are won
dering what It will be when Fournier
gets his motor tandem going this week.
. Eddie Bald, the champion sprinter, dis
tinguished himself by riding a half-mile
ln the speedy time of :56 2-5 seconds.
Downing and Cotter of California
showed half a dozen Eastern tandem
teams the way across the tape in a pur
suit tandem race which was wildly ex
citing. In the last heat there were three
teamsâ Downing and Cotter, Stevens and
Coulter and the Turville brothers. Each
team started at a different point on the
track, equal distances apart, and the race
was that the team which first caught up
with and passed the other two teams

should be declared winners. It only took
Downing and Cotter a mile and five laps
to do this, their time for that distance
being 3:21.
Fournier on his motor cycle had a pur
suit race witn Eaton and Goodman on a
tandem, which was won by the French
man in short order. â¢
During the afternoon Harry Elkes also
lowered the two-mile world's Indoor rec
ord, making it in 3:45, the last mile being
ridden ln 1:50. .
Even standing room was at a premium
last night, there was such an immense
j crowd present.
Tim McGrath, the noted trainer of
pugilists, was seen in a brown study at
the track side last night. When asked
what he was dreaming about he replied:
"I was just thinking what nice, pleasant
game prize-fighting is compared to a six
day race."
"Tiv" Kreling is credited with the state
ment that it takes a man with a low
forehead and square head to make a suc
cessful six-day rider.
Miller is a one to five favorite in the
betting. The odds on the others run up
to 200 to 1. If Aronson continues in sec
ond place, however, seme plungers will
cash heavily, as a hot tip was out on him
early In the race to run second, and he
was well played at long odds.

tendance, medicine funeral benefits and
donations to members in need. The ag
gregate of money in the funds of the sev
eral courts was $152,260, an Increase of
$8000 over the previous year. Each mem
ber allowed so much a week during the
time he Is sick or disabled and the num
ber of "sick days," as they are called
that were reported during the past year
was in the aggregate 51,518. The .value oi
the property owned by tÃfc Grand court
L $6974 and' the amount In the hands of
the erand treasurer Is $4269.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1899.
MILLER AND THE LESSER LIGHTS CIRCLE WEARILY IN THEIR ORBITS.
THE EVERGREEN
STAKE IS TAKEN
BY WHAT-ER LOU
Heat Racing Proved
His Game.
PILOTED BY CHARLEY THORPE
THE BACHELOR EARNED SEC
OND MONEY.
Four Winning Favorites at Ingle
sideDavid Tenny Again Took
a Handicap â Beaten
by Our Climate. ,
The Evergreen stakes, decided In the
old-fashioned wayâ by attracted
thÂ© largest crowd of the bi-weekly meet
ing to Ingleside track yesterday. There
was little opportunity for the tossing of
hats, breaking of canes, men crying with
delight and the women sobbing, as ln by
gone days, for the Eastern horse, What-
Er Lou, ridden by Charlie Thorpe, won
in straight heats. But four opposed him â
Red Glenn, The Bachelor and Morellito.
At the conclusion of the first heat the lat
ter came in limping, and was allowed to
be drawn. By the conditions What-Er
Lou was asked to carry 11. pounds, and
many, knowing his dislike for weight, fig
ured that after he had once covered the
distance â mile and a furlong he
would be all out. Still he ruled a warm
6-to-5 favorite. Thorpe and the bay horse
took the first heat ln rag-time, stepping
the journey in 1:56. Bullman, on Red
Glenn, contented himself -with taking j
matters very quietly, finishing a subdued !
second, four lengths ahead of The Bache- j
lor. After this, the heat winner was a
1 to 2 chance. Cooling out well, What- i
Er Lou came out and took the deciding I
heat, in much the same manner as the |
first. Red Glenn once made a bluff, but
fell back, and The Bachelor, heavily
backed by the inside set, beat him for the
place. This heat was covered In 1:54%,
and What-Er Lou was ridden out to the
last ounce.
The favorites were in a sociable frame
of mind, with a couple of exceptions, cap
turing four of the purses. In the fourth
event, with a big field going to the post,
an accident was narrowly averted. On
the back stretch, Gllberto and Scintillate
fell, but Jockeys Powell and Woods for
tunately escaped with slight bruises.
Earnshaw Bros, captured the opening
run, over one mile and a furlong, with
Imp. Mistral 11. The English-bred horse
had a strong call in the betting, and at
the finish won with nothing to spare from
Wheel of Fortune,, the second, choice.
Claudlana was out in front for a piece,
but blew up speedily. Roadrunner, a 100
to 1 shot, was ridden into the show by
Powell. .
The result of the mile and a quarter
handicap, was a "Waterloo" for the tal
ent. Ferrier. with Hennery In the sad
dle, received extensive support at the
short price of 7 to 10, and was outfooted
the entire route by Our Climate. The lat
ter, piloted to perfection by Doane, was
4 and 5 to 1 In the ring. Tom Smith
made a stumble over the last hurdle, los
ing the show to Tortonl. .
A field of thirteen platers faced the
webbing in the mile selling race. Magnus,,
the -mount -of "Skeets" Martin, was a
13 to 6 favorite. Away first, the first
choice was never headed, winning hard
ridden from the 20 to 1 shot, Bonnie lone.
Castake, another outsider, finished in the
show.
The second mile selling affair developed
a surprise. Merops,. ridden by Devin, and
10 and 12 to 1 in the betting, headed his
field in the run home, and in a hard drive
led .Sardonic out half a length. â¢ Nash
Turner on. the -favorite. Opponent, met
with his usual luck, landing outside of the
money. (
The mile and a furlong handicap ended
in a pretty duel between David Tenny,
carrying top weight, and Adolph Spreck
els. -Tenny was an even-money favorite,
and in a desperate drive "Skeets" Martin
hustled him by the winning post first by
a nose.' The- light-weighted Mlstleton fin
ished third. _
, Track Notes.
Robert W. . Pinkerton of the great de
tective agency was noticed among the
crowd. ' . - '
The latest edition of the form book was
placed on sale yesterday. It contains a
complete record of all races run to date.
George Charette, one of the Merrlmac
heroes, and two brother officers of the
lowa, enjoyed the sport from the club
house balcony.
When Scintillate, which fell, with Powell
in the fourth event, scrambled to her
feet, she started on a dead run for the
| back stretch gate. She smashed the up
! per railing, and in the scrimmage, Q.
Ryder, trainer of The Fretter, was sever
ly Injured. â  aa'-'a'
"Kid" McCoy, the famed boxer, was
about the ring, shaking hands with East
i crn acquaintances. Before the second
j race was run the "Kid" had signed arti
cles with a turkey sandwich, that would
have caused a jockey to have been posted
ten pounds overweight.
Joe Harvey lost his good mare. Wheel
of Fortune, yesterday. Trainer Fisher
entered her in the opening mile dash to
be sold for $300. She finished second and
was claimed by. Hugh Jones, owner of
Charley who "also ran" in the same
race. Jones afterward stated that he was
tired of chasing $2500 horse., with "crabs."
As Charley Relf could hardly be expected
to capture a fixed race, Bookmaker Jones'
'plaint seems Incomprehensible.
It has reached such a point at the track
that If a horse changes ownership down in
Mexico, the report ls at once spread that
"Plunger Hill" or Howard purchased the
animal. Yesterday Fred Foster denied
that the Australian bettor had anything
to do with buying Yellow Tall. Mr. Fos
ter has been some years on the turf, and
It would not be surprising if he possessed
a bit of coin himself.
lowa Entertainment Postponed.
The entertainment and performance
which the crew of tho battleship lowa
propose to tender Mayor Phelan in re
turn for the courtesy extended to tiiem
by him has been postponed from Febru
ary 22, the date originally set. This was
done on account of Mayor Phelan having
made a previous engagement for that
evening. The date has been accordingly
set for Saturday, February 25.

SPORT AT STOW LAKE.
San Francisco Fly Casting Club Holds

At Stow Lake yesterday the members
I of the San Francisco Fly-casting Club
I held their tournament. The attendance
was exceptionally good for an opening
day. The weather was well nigh, perfect
for the sport early in the day, but later
in the afternoon a north wind prevented
any very good scores being made. Much
Interest was manifested by the members
in the "lure casting" contest, something
never before -undertaken on this coast.

FAIR LADIES
MUST NOT BET
ON DOG DACES
A { New Rule in Effect
at Ingleside.
WOMEN WERE RATHER BRASH
FIFTY-ONE COURSES WERE RUN
OFF IN QUICK ORDER.
Short Enders That Put in Appear
ance at the Last Momenta Dogs
: That Should Win
- To-Day.
The crowd at Ingleside Coursing Park
was so large yesterday that the officers
of the Ingleside Coursing Club held a spe
cial meeting, the object of which was to
exclude women and boys from that part
of the grand stand which Is known as the
betting ring. The women who never miss
a coursing meeting felt chagrined when
they were informed of the new departure
debarring them from an opportunity
of resting their tired anatomies against
the sides of the pool boxes, but the "new
ones," who have had only ? a limited ex
perience ln the game, accepted the order
to vacate the premises with good grace
and wended their way slowly to the "up
per deck," where a magnificent view of
the coursing can ' always be had. The
Innovation will doubtless be the means of
thinning the ranks of women gamblers,
who neglect household duties for the al
lurements which are always attached to
a game of chance. The managers of In
gleside Park received the congratulations
of the sportsmen who were present for
the move they made in what certainly is
the right direction.
The coursing yesterday was truly ex
cellent. The hares ran surprisingly well,
thanks to Game-keeper Harry Murray,
who Is considered the superior of all men
In the art of putting hares in condition
to give their pursuers courses that are of
the grueling kind. , V v.''
The upset of Commodore Nash by
Eleven Spot was one of the big surprises
of the day, but Byrne's young dog ran like
a warrior and handsomely defeated the
old bread-winner. Miss SRyball and Ber
nice-had a hard trial. The hare was a
representative of the old guard and it
seemingly amused the little animal to
run over several miles of sod in front of
its enemies, who were thoroughly pumped
when the course ended. Tullamore and
Olympus and Black Bess and Sir John
Arnot were pretty well used-up when they
were returned to their respective handlers.
The sport to-day should be first ciass, as
the winning dogs of yesterday will meet
ln the slips. Among. the. noted sportsmen,
who will be present to see the races, are
Harry Geowtage and W. Crocker of New
York. Those gentlemen came to this
city purposely to become acquainted with
the game and to learn how coursing can
be conducted with pleasure and profit for
all those who take an Interest in the pas
time. *
They propose to Inauguarate coursing
in the State of New York on a plan simi
lar to that which made popular the sport
In this State. - ...

OUR GAME AND FISH.
Two Commissions Necessary to Pro
tect the Supply Which Is
Rapidly Decreasing."
Sportsmen who have a predilection for
quail and duck shooting are afforded only
a few more weeks in which to enjoy out
ings with dog and gun in the field or
marsh.
According to the State game law the
open season for dove shooting is from
July 15 to February 15. Mountain quail
and grouse from September 1 to Febru
ary 15. Valley quail, wild duck and rail
from October 1 to March 1. It will, there
fore, be seen that duck and. quail shooting
will end with this month in all. parts of
the State.
The Supervisors of Alameda County
have appointed W. S. Dunlevy game war
den, vice J. L. Donovan, whose term of
office has expired. A new game ordinance
for the county has also been passed and
went into effect last week. It says that
the closed season for quail, bob white or
partridge is from February 1 to Novem
ber 1, and for male deer from October I
to July 1, while Chinese or Japanese
pheasants must not be taken for five
years. The ordinance also prohibits the
shipment of game birds and game ani
mals outside of the county. And the fin
for transgressing the laws from $20 to
$500, or imprisonment from ten to one
hundred and fifty days, or both. If all
other counties and States had Boards of
Supervisors who took as deep an interest
ln the protection of game as the Super
visors of Alameda County there would
be ample sport for all for many years to
come: but according to the terrible de
struction of game that is now being
wrought by pothunters, and especially
those who "live solely by market hunting,
It can be said, and without the least fear
of contradiction, that quail and duck will
be few and far between five years hence.
The Supervisors of the different counties
will then possibly wake up to a sense of
duty and. so to speak, order the stable
door locked when the horse is gone. _
The new law now pending oeiore the
Oregon Legislature prohibits the killing
of more than twenty wild ducks in one
day by a single gunner. â_ââ
The sportsmen of Santa Barbara are ag
itating plans for the holding at that
place of a big pigeon tournament a la
Monte Carlo, to decide the championship
of California, Â ;. '_2< _.
An article entitled "Divide the Commis
sion" appeared in a recent number of
Western Sports. The writer certainly hit
the nail on the head when he advocated
a" segregation of the fish and game de
partments of the State, which are at
present under the management and con
trol of the State Fish and Game Commis
sion. It is not feasible to suppose that
the Board of Fish and Game Commis
sioners can kill two birds with one stone
so to speak. In fact, the commission has
Its hands full in looking after the fish
interests of the State, which have grown
of late years into vast proportions. The
idea of two separate commissionsâ for
game and one for fish-Is not a new one
to many of the Eastern States. Michigan,
Rhode Island, Colorado and Pennsylva
nia have special State officers to super
vise the protection of game in addition
to well equipped fish commissioners. The
article ln question says: .
In California it is more a question of money
than of two commissions. The second in th*
Union in size and the first in average Indi
vidual wealth, this State appropriates the mu
nificent sum of 12500 annually for the pro
tection and propagation of its game.
Think of it: True, the Fish Com
mission was allowed $45,000 for Its
needs by the last Legislature, but $40,000 of
this sum was distinctly directed to the pur
poses of fish, leaving but t^ooo for the gam
side of the matter. â  Official red tape provides
nothing for emergenc-*. That $5000. assigned
to cover a Deriod of two years, ls, of course,
exhausted, but the commissioners, however
willing, flnd their hands tied for lack of funds,
and they cannot under the law divert one dollar
of the fish appropriation even though the fate
of the entire game Interests of the State were
at stake.
Without the least desire to -see the present
fish appropriation decreased one penny It may
be said that the sum of $2500 a year Is inade
quate for game protection purposes. Surely
it was not parsimonlc-usness. but rather failure
to . comprehend the importance of the question
that led the legislature to make this paltry
allowance. Comoarisons, If odious, are,.some
times instructive. There a.rr counties in Cali
fornia big enough to make three Atlantic sea
board States. Eastern Legislatures have
learned that game protection pays, that money
expended for this purpose is a splendid Invest
ment from a pecuniary point of view aside
from the national economy Involved In the
question.. It was this idea that induced Maine
years ago to nurse its game interests, until
now 125,000 is placed at the disposal of Its
game wardens annually, "and the game Inter
est is one of the first, if not the first, in the
entire State,"- according to the last report of
th-> commission, and yet Maine is but one and
a half times larger than the single county of
San Bernardino. Michigan with about a third
the territory, of California devotes $33,000 an
nually to game culture. New York expends
$72,000 annually for the : same purpose, and
New Jersey $30,000, and yet the whole of the
last State could be placed in Fresno County,
with enough to make a Rhode Island to spare.
The Jersey law provides for the appointment
of twenty-five wardens at a salary of $800 a
year, with ample allowance for traveling ex
penses. On the same basis it . would take
about 600 warden to cover the territory
embraced in this State. Massachusetts, about
twice the size of Humboldt County, has a.
corps of salaried game â  wardens. : Wisconsin,
about a third the size of California, manages
to devote about $25,000 a year for the proU-.
tlon of its game, and finds it a good invest-.
ment. The game wardens of Minnesota have
$10,000 a year at their disposal and yet Minne
sota is but half as large as this State. Tho
comparison might be Indefinitely continued,
but the showing would add no credit to us.
Nearly fifteen times as large a.-* Rhode Island.
California expends not quite one-fifth as much
for the protection of game.
The question is an Important one, not only
to the sportsmen, but to the whole people.
Game protection- demands the serious consid
eration of the whole people. Money spent to
this end is well Fpent. One of the chief at
tractions of the State is being utterly neglected.
Whether or not the game interests are segre
gated from those of the fish and placed under
the control of a separate bureau or game
wardens, the crying r ed of the hour Is more
money, and plenty of It. to protect the ani
mals and the birds that have so large a place
in the general catalogue of our attractions
from ruthless destruction at the hands of the
thoughtless and the reckless.

under consideration.
Judging from the matter in which
things are now moving the appropriation
from the State will be assured, as pre
viously stated, by the end of this week,
and the permanent organization of the
exposition projectors will probably be
taken up during the early part of
next week. The importance of prompt
and energetic action is appreciated and
all are anxious to get down to the work
of discussing and adopting plans for the
exhibition. A number of applications for
employment and suggestions for the ex
position have been received by various
members of the committee, but these are
all simply placed on file to be considered
at the proper time. Among the plans sub
mitted Is one drafted by a prominent local
architect on suggestions and ideas ad
vanced by Mr. Patton, which is herewith
reproduced.
TO THE INTEREST OF EVERY
MUNICIPALITY TO CO-OPERATE
MONTEREY, Feb. From present in
dications it would seem that the old
capital city is far the most enthusiastic
of the middle California towns regarding
tlie proposed exposition in San Francisco
in 1901. Many prominent citizens have ex
pressed themselves strongly in favor of
the exposition.
Mayor R. F. Johnson, in speaking of the |
plan to-day, said: "I am most strongly in |
favor of such an exposition, whether |
speaking officially or as a private citizen.
I think it will greatly benefit not only I
San Francisco and the surrounding sec
tion, but the entire State. IT all the towns :
of California co-operate with Â«San Fran
cisco as they should, for their own inter
est, and lend their best efforts toward I
showing California to the world as she i
really is, a large proportion of people who j
come to visit the exposition will remain |
permanently. I think the agricultural
products and possibilities of the State
should be especially the point of such an
exposition as is proposed. The town of
Monterey not only heartily indorses the
project* but stands ready to do all in
her power toward bringing It to a suc
cessful accomplishment. '
H. A. Greene, one of Monterey's most
progressive and public-spirited residents,
and who, as Director General of Califor
nia's Semi-Centennial Jubilee, knows from
practical experience what exhibitions of
that character can do for a town, is very
outspoken in his enthusiasm for the ex
position of 1901.
WILL STIMULATE COMMERCIAL
W DEVELOPMENT ON THE PACIFIC
'MARYSVILLE, Feb. 18.â "I have paid
little attention to the proposition for an
national exposition In San Francisco
in 1901," said Mayor C. S. Brooks to-day.
"In a general way I might say that such
an exposition, if conducted along proper
line, would be' productive of great good,
not only to San Francisco and to the
whole-S tate, but to the entire Pacific
slope as well. Our newly acquired terri
tory lift the Pacific â  Ocean should open a
market for many of our products, which
ought t> result In a great commercial de
velopment on this side of our continent.
If the proposed exposition should stimu
late this development it would be a good
investment. I am not familiar enough
with "the -Provisions of the bill before the
Legislature authorizing cities and coun
ties to apptoprlate money for the support
of + he pro]>osed exposition, to express an
opinion of i* terms, but as each city and
county ought to-be able to decide for it
s-elf wha* itbvould do in this matter, I
see no objecton. to giving them this op

TENNIS MATCHES.
Girls' High School Club Organized,
and a Court Will Be Laid in
the Near Future.
The tennis enthusiasts among the lady
players of the Girls' High School have
organized a club, and in a few weeks the
necessary money was subscribed for the
building of a court on the vacant space
back of the school. It is not yet deter
mined whether the court will, be of clay
or bitumen. The advice of the expert,
Joseph Daily, was sought, and he sug
gested the laying of a clay court. It Is
very likely that bitumen will be selected,
as the expense of keeping a clay court
in order is continuous.
The ladies' doubles tournament which
was to have been played on the Califor
nia Club courts on Wednesday last was
postponed again, due to the inability of
many of the teams entered to be present.
The date now set is February 21. The
list of teams published in last Saturday's
Call shows the extent of interest taken
in these tournaments by the young lady
players. The courts have been much used
by them during the week, and the tourna
ment of the 21st should show some Im
provement in feminine playing.
It is very likely that a round robin tour
nament will be played this afternoon.
Nothing definite has been arranged, but
it is tacitly understood among the players.
During the week a number of hot
matches were played, the most noticeable
of which Was that between George Whit
ney, the undefeated champion of this side
of the bay, and Percy Murdock, the Ala
medan, who has won many, crowns of
laurel on the other side. Whitney took
his measure without much ado. They
played five sets, all of, which George
Whitney won in ridiculously easy fashion.
The scores read: 6â 6â3, 6âo, 6âl, 6â2.
Murdock obtained a small meed of re
venge, however, defeating Grant Smith,
6-2. : yyy..A
Other contests of interest were as fol
lows: Smith beat Cornell, 6â4, 7â5, 5â7;

The question as to whether the volun

Spanish Cortes ratify the treaty of peace
is one that is worrying those who have
relatives or friends in the servce. Tnere
is a wide diversity of opinion on this sub

what the obligations of the volunteers are
to the Government:
" 'The volunteer army shall be main
tained only during the , existence of war,
or while war is imminent. . . . Provid
ed, That all enlistments for the volunteer
army shall be for the term of two years. *
unless sooner terminated, and that all of
ficers and men composing said army shall
be discharged from the service** of the
United States when the purposes for
which' they were called into service shall
have been accomplished, or on the conclu
sion of hostilities.'
"However, considering the enlistment
clause, it appears that the men can be
held for the full two years, if the Gov
ernment really needs their services.
In view of the probable failure to pass
in this Congress the bill providing for the
increase of the regular army, the clause
in the enlistment which says "I will serve
them faithful! v against all J their enemies,
whomsoever," makes it almost certain
that the volunteers can and will be held
for service in the Philippines as well as
in Cuba and Porto Rico, until such time
as the regular army has been enlarged
sufficiently -to take the- place of the vol
unteers. '~ _ ..
The confusion of opinions as to the
status of the .volunteers largely grows
out of the proviso under which men en
listed, in the. regular army to fight the
Spaniards. In general orders No. 40 It is
stipulated that "By direction of the Sec
retary of â  War it Is announced that men
enlisted or re-enlisted in the regular army
during the war may be informed that
they will be granted, their discharges, if
desired, at the. Close of the war, upon
their individual applications. .
Should the army bill- now before Con
gress become a law it is announced that
the volunteers will be mustered out at tht
earliest possible moment.
AMONG THE OARSMEN.
A Flotilla ofÃowboats Visits the
â :â ;'â .. Battlesx-,p lowa.
At the last meeting of the Pacific Asso
elation of the Amateur Athletic Union no
representative of the South End Rowing
Club was present, and the secretary of
the association was instructed to notify
the club of this fact.
M. Breen, though he has not attended
the last three or four meetings of the
board, has not sent in his resignation and
the board might wait until its annual
meeting before electing a successor to
him. _ *_
It is a curious fact that, though the
Pacific Association is practically con
trolled by oarsmen and concerns itself
very little about any sports except row
ing and swimming, the former is not
mentioned in the list of sports over which
the union claims jurisdiction. Yet tugs
of war, boxing, wrestling and other con
tests, over which the union does claim
jurisdiction, go on without check or con
trol by the Pacific Association. It is true
that the union "recognizes all athletic
sports," but what "recognition without
jurisdiction amounts to is by no means
clear. It looks as though a considerable
disturbance is imminent in the board, but
just what its nature or outcome will De
it is not easy to see. The recent meet
ings of the board have been quite peace
ful, but there Is a feeling that the calm
is of the sort that precedes a storm, tne

which it is a member, claims jurisdiction.
J. R. Bockman, the newly elected presi
dent of the board of managers of the
Pacific Association, has invited the mem
bers of the board to a dinner to-morrow.
The vaudeville entertainment given last
week in aid of the building fund of the
Alameda Boat Club was very success
ful. It realized about 850 for the fund
for enlarging and improving the club
house. At the last meeting John H. Mas- ,
tcrson, George Wigney and Sydney \<?aco ,
were elected, and two more applications
for membership are on hand. David,
Greenleaf, formerly lieutenant captain of ,
the club, has furnished considerable
amusement to his friends by a recent ex
ploit. He and some companions went for
a sail in the yacht Slow. Off the Brothers
the water was rough and the blue-flame
oil stove tipped over. David smothered
the flames with an old coat. in the pock
ets of which there were afterward found
several loaded cartridges. y-'A-y . ! ~
The Pioneers have now got their boat
house and float in order. On Sunday sev

January 17, 1899.
F. HUMPHREYS, M. D.,
MY DEAR DOCTOR:
I cannot sufficiently thank you for the
grateful and immediate relief your Spe-
cific No. 77 gave to me.
I was really very ill Sunday evening.
I had a fierce Chill and what we used
to call "The Rigors" in the Army, fol-
lowed by a very high fever.
The pains, pericarditis and osteritis,
arising from the Cable Car injury, as
well as the Grip, are at this moment, i
Tuesday morning, almost entirely ]
abated.
Sincerely yours,
SCHUYLER HAMILTON,
Maj. Gen. Vols., U. S. A.

A HOME STORY IN A FEW WORDS.
Pay rent during the years 1899, 1900. 1901,
1902, 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1906 and your total
investment will bring you what? Nothing.
Pay for a hoÂ«se on monthly Installments
during the same years, and your total in-
vestment will bring you what? A home all
paid for. It has cost you exactly the same
rent money you have been paying to your
landlord, but It has given you a deed to the
home that will always be your own. Three
new houses on the Heyman Tract now for
sale on those terms. Go out and see them.
Ask for James Cotter, the builder, who will
show them to you. Take Misslon-st. cars,
transfer to Twenty-second-st. cars, which
will bring you directly in front of the tract.

CUPID PLAYING
IN BAD LUCK
Heated Quarrel About
Marriages.
LEGAL WAR AT SAN REFAEL
TWO COUPLES DOUBTFUL OF
THEIR UNION.
Justice Hodden Declares Recorder
Gardner Has No Right to Pro
nounce Lovers Man and
Wife.
. Special Dispatch to The Call.
; * SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 18.â Cupid is play
ing- in hard luck In this city at the pres
ent time, and the "land office" marriage
business formerly carried on by the brok
ers of the ermine has assumed a frosty
aspect." What comes near being a dead- ,
lock is the result of a heated dispute on
the part of Justice George Bodden and
City Recorder Edwin Gardner as to the
! legal right of the latter to officiate at
marriage ceremonies. Pending a judicial
decision there are two couples who are
not really certain whether they are united
! or not.
Up to the last election both officials were
Justices of the Peace, Gardner being also
City Recorder, but one office was then
abolished and Rodden "won out" for elec
tion. Everything was peaceful sailing un
til one day a youthful couple came to
town and were made man and wifeâ at
least that Is Gardner's claimâ by the Re
corder. Rodden Insisted that Gardner had
no legal authority to. marry the two, and
that there ' was, in truth, no marriage
ceremony performed. Gardner, on the
other hand, declared that a Supreme
Court decision recorded in 88 Cal.. pages
407 and 408, entitles a City Recorder to
perform all the functions of a Justice of
the Peace, except in criminal cases tried
under a municipal ordinance.
To-day there was another clash. Ed
ward G. Burkhardt, living at No. 220 Thir
teenth street, San Francisco, procured a
license and was married to Lillian Cheva
lier, residing on the southeast corner of
Sixth and Mission streets, Justice Rodden
officiating. Recorder Gardner angrily in
sisted that he had been "bunkoed out
of performing the ceremony and is sharp
ening an ax for Rodden, County Clerk
Graham and J. J. Murray, who was at
one time typewritist for ex-District At
torney Martfnelll. ? ,
"A common friend spoke to me ana
asked me to perform the ceremony inthis
case," he said, "but Rodden went after
Burkhardt and told him I had no legal
right to marry people. The boy got scared
and let Rodden marry him to Miss Cheva
lier at the house of Donald Sutherland.
County Clerk Graham is doing all he can
against me and so is Joe Murray. Any
way. Burkhardt gave me $2 oO because of
the trouble he put me to in making the
engagement. I have a right under a de
cision of the Supreme Court to officiate
at a marriage ceremony, and I am not
going to be cheated out of my rights
Justice a fight." denies that the codes
Justice Rodden aenies that the codes
authorize a City Recorder to officiate at
a manage, and characterizes Gardner
claim as absurd. He asserts his belief
that two couples alleged to have been
married by the Recorder are not really
m "What I told Burkhardt," he said, "was
that I am khe only Justice of the Peace in
San Rafael; but that if he wanted to run
the risk of being married by Gardner to
go ahead. He didn't care to risk it, and
that is all there was to it."
Now the two officials do not speak as
they pass by. Cupid will have to moan
over the situation until there is a suit at
law and the question is settled once for
all.

E. B. Howard, constituting the San
Jose firm of Howard & Co., orchardists,
dried fruit merchants, etc., filed a peti
i tion yesterday in the United States Dis
j trict Court asking to be declared Insol
vent. He states his assets to be $286,386,
on which he expects to realize $113,000, the
balance due him for fruit shipped by him
to the East. , His liabilities will amount
! to $151,440. G_E9I
The petition reveals some remarkable
banking done by the recently defunct
Union Savings Bank of San Jose. It
states that on May 25, IS9B, he was in
debted to the Union Savings Bank $109,802
overdrafts and $116,500 unpaid notes given
by him to the bank. On that date How
ard determined that he could not and
would not continue to do business under
such a heavy load of indebtednesss and
so informed "the president of the bank.
The president insisted that the petitioner
should continue in business and finally
induced him to continue in business by
agreeing to wipe out and cancel all such
then existing Indebtedness from the peti
tioner to said bank except that such
amount of debts due the petitioner from
Eastern shipments of fruit * for the sea
son of 1897 should be applied to said in
debtedness. The petitioner agreed and the
bank discontinued the old account and
bank pass book, gave him a new blank
pass book and opened a new account with
him. It is alleged further that the presi
dent of the bank agreed to return said
! notes to the petitioner, but failed to do
so upon the excuse that the notes were
in San Francisco, but finally gave him
the following memorandum in writing:
SAN JOSE, June 2S. 1898.

UNION SAVINGS BANK of San Jose.
This agreement was signed by the pres
ident of the bank and by Howard. It was
stated further that $40,000 was due How
ard & Co. from the fruit firm of E. E.
Thomas & Co. ._.___-._.â¢
The attorney for Howard said that his
client would be able to pay S5 cents on
the dollar unless the court Insists on put
ting in the claim of the Union Savings
Bank for $226,000.
The revelations made in the petition
have caused a mild sensation among those
not familiar with the free and easy man
ner in which the bank has been conduct
ed and with the relations between the
Howard Fruit Company and the Thomas
Fruit Company. Edward Thomas of the
last named firm committed suicide in this
city a few weeks ago. leaving a bank
book showing overdrafts on the bank.
He was the president of the company and
the company itself, it is said, while How
ard seemed to have as much to say in
its affairs as had Thomas', who evidently
was not as successful in getting away
with such weighty overdrafts as was his
partner ln speculation, Mr. Howard.
There can be no doubt that the claim
of the bank for $226,000 will be filed at the
proper time, for some showing must be
made to lighten the fall of the bank, even
if it throws light upon a piece of bank
wrecking paralleled only by that eighth
wonder of the world, . the management
of the McDonald bunko shops in this city.
Next Monday the matter will come up
before Judge de Haven in the United
Stales District Court, and it is expected
that there will be several legal compllca
cations.
DIRECTORS DISLIKED.
Howard's Bankruptcy Proceedings
Throw Light on Their Actions.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 18.â A committee of
stockholders appeared at a meeting of the
board of directors of the Union Savings
Bank this afternoon and demanded the
resignation of the entire board. These
unwelcome callers were: Cyrus Jones,
James W. Rea, J. I.eiter and F. K. Led
yard. They were pdlitely received and In
turn settled right down to business and
told the directors in a few words that
they must give way ,to their successors.
The bank was about to go into liquidation,
and as they had been the means of wreck
ing it they were, not the proper persons
to close its business. committee was
appointed at a secret meeting of the
stockholders a few days ago, at which
time a number of the latter resolved to
right the matter of levying assessments.
The directors took no action on this re
quest 'A ' - * " y f
- H. Ward Wright,- the ex-president, ten
dered his resignation, as director, which
was quickly accepted. . The vacancy was
not filled ._â¢â _._ - Â«, _
â  Late this afternoon the directors filed
an answer to the suit Instituted by the
Attorney General to have the bank de
clared insolvent. All allegations are ad
mitted with the exception the last, and
they deny they are attempting to carry
on business. - " ' ' ,
The filing of Howard petition in bank
ruptcy has brought to light several things
not yet published. Most startling of these
is the fact that the Union Savings Bank,
after Howard had told them he was in
solvent and wished to assign for the bene
fit ;of his creditors ; last June, forced him
to continue? in business- and virtually
wiped out an indebtedness of $226,302. Of
this $109,802 was an overdraft and $116,500
in notes. So confident is Howard's at
torney, S. F. I.eib. that this money can
not be collected that he refused to place
it - among the , liabilities. If i Howard had
insisted on going into Insolvency, last June
he would have dragged the bank with
him, and, like a drowning' man grasping
at -a straw, the bank was willing to wipe
out the indebtedness if he would continue
in business and save them. Howard's lia
bilities are $151,440 24, with assets of $286,
--386. The real value of available assets.
Attorney Leib says, is $115,000.
Another surprise is the statement that
T. R. Weaver, who attached Howard for
$2000 and' brought on' the bank failure,
was a partner of the bankrupt last year
under the name of Weaver & Co.. oeing
still indebted to Howard for $7500. Before
attaching Howard, Weaver drew $2900 out
of the Union Savings Bank, and now it is
known that a partnership existed between
the two color is given to the story that
he acted at the Instance of the bank.
Ever since the bank failure. Howard has
deposited all cash receipts in' the bank for
the benefit of the creditors, and there is
now on hand $3108 15. This shows honesty,
and Howard is not being blamed so much
as the bank officials would like to have
him for the bank failure.
Myra E. Wright, to whom was given a
deed of the bank premises to secure a
loan of $60,000. and her husband, W. H.
Wright, have been endeavoring to borrow
money from various bankers on that prop
erty, offering the deed as collateral. It
is not believed the deed will hold, and as
yet no one has been found willing to take
the risk. __
GAY GOLFERS ON
OAKLAND LINKS
TIBBETTS CUP TOURNAMENT
WON BY E. R. FOLGER.
Some Interesting Mixed Foursomes
Were Played Among the Club
Members Yesterday.
Yesterday was a busy day on the links
of the Oakland Golf Club. A large number
of players were out on the course, and
many visited the club house. The cap
tain was resplendent in a gilt-buttoned
scarlet jacket, with stockings and gait
ers of the most approved type. Many of
the club members were scarcely less gaily
attired.
The third tournament for the Tibbets
cup, which began on February 4, and lias
been going on at Intervals since that date,
was concluded yesterday. There were
originally twenty-one entries for the tour
nament, eleven of whom drew byes, the
remaining ten being divided into five pairs
in the preliminary round. The five win
ners in the first round, with the eleven
byes, made up eight pairs in the second
round; the third round consisted of the
eight winners in the second round, drawn
in pairs against each other; in the fourth
round the contestants had come down to
four, and in the final round to two. These
two were D. F. Belden, winner of the
second competition for the Tibbets cup,
and E. R. Folger, one of the strongest
players of the Oakland club. E. R. Folger
is a more than usually dangerous com
petitor, from the fact that he plays a
stronger and more accurate game in a
contest than he does in ordinary practice.
The final round resulted in the victory
of E R. Folger. who won by the hand
some margin of 5 up. The whole tourna
ment by rounds, with the handicaps of
each player, is shown in the table.
The mixed foursomes, for club members,
held yesterday on the Oakland links, were
both novel and picturesque, novel as being
the first contest of the kind held on any
of the local links, and picturesque from
the bright attire of the players. The
warmth of the day had caused some of
the young ladies to don white skirts and
doff their hats.
Nine ladies had entered the mixed four
somes and of this number seven took
part. They were paired as follows: Miss
Marguerite Jolliffe and T. R. Hutchin
son: Mrs. W. P. Johnson and P. E.
Bowles; Mrs. H. J. Knowles and J. M.
Taft; Mrs. P. E. Bowles and Orestes
Pierce; Miss M. Deane and F. S. Stratton;
Miss Alice Moffltt and P. E. Bowles Jr.;
Miss Belle Mhoon and V. Bakewell. Miss
M. Jolliffe and T. R. Hutchinson drawing
a bye. twelve players; or three foursomes,
were left in the first round, which result
ed thus: Mrs. W. P. Johnson and P. E.
Bowles defeated Mrs. H. J. Knowles and
J. M. Taft; Mrs. P. E. Bowles and Ores
tes Pierce defeated Miss M. Deane and
F. S. Stratton 2 up; Miss Alice Moffltt and
P. E. Bowles Jr. defeated Miss Belle
Mhoon and V. Bakewell 2 up.
In the second round Mrs. W. P. Johnson
and P. E. Bowles defeated Miss Marguer
ite Jolliffe and T. R. Hutchinson: Miss
Alice Moffltt and P. E. Bowles Jr. defeat
ed Mrs. P. E. Bowles and Orestes Pierce.
Two pairs are now left Inâ Mrs. W. P.
Johnson and P. E. Bowles and Miss Alice
Moffltt and P. E. Bowles Jr.
The foursome in which Miss Alice Mof
fltt and P. E. Bowles Jr. defeated Mrs.
P. E. Bowles and Orestes Pierce was a
very close contest. After tying to nine
holes the game was won on the tenth
hole by one stroke.

Some time ago the founders of the club
secured from 'the Campbell estate a tract
of about 420 acres, of which ten were
purchased as a site for a club house,
stable, etc. Arrangements have been
made with the Marin County Water
Works to lay about 6500 feet of pipe, by
which water will be conveyed to the club
house; the directors of the club have
agreed to extend the system to several,
if not to the whole number, of the greens.
The club house is handsome and roomy,
being 60 feet by 90 feet; its leading feature
is a porch or veranda â¢ twenty-one feet
deep and running along the entire front.
It is built of redwood, stained and dark
ened with oil, and contains a large gen
eral club room, with alcoves, dressing
room for men, dressing room for ladies,
and abundant space for lockers, of which
there are sixty for ladies and 140 for men.
In the rear are men's and ladies' shower
baths, and a kitchen with rooms for the
man in charge of the house and his wife.
The main club room is sixty feet by thir
ty-five feet, and a room is also provided
for the secretary and his clerk. The house
was designed by the architect, S. New
som. A station, to be named Golf, will
be put in by the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railroad, which will set Passen
gers down about 3000 feet from the club
house. An omnibus line will also be es
tablished to convey golfers and visitors to
the links on Saturdays and Sundays.
The club members have hitherto been
using a nine-hole course laid out by T. w.

Coronado, and coached some of the earli

California. The new course consists of
eighteen holes, and is the longest In the
United States, being 6291 yards. The
greens will be about forty feet in diam

be a hundred" feet across. The course
presents greater variety and diversity

MISS EMMA EMOND.
(Before Bending for a free trial package.) (After using- the free trial and directions.)
Those who are losing their hair or have j
parted with their locks can have it restored by
a remedy that is sent free to all. A Cincinnati
firm has concluded that the best way to con-
vince people that hair ; can be grown on any |
head Is to let them try it and see for them-
selves. All sorts of theories have been ad-
vanced to account for falling hair, but after !
all it is the remedy we are after and not the i
theory. People who need more hair or ' are j
anxious to save what they have, or from sick- |
ness, dandruff or other causes have lost their j
hair, should at once send their name and ad- i
dress to the Altenheim Medical Dispensary, 393 |

cents in stamps to cover postage, and they j
will forward prepaid by mall a sufficient

ing all trace of dandruff and scalp diseases and ;
forcing a new growth of hair. The remedy is i
not a â¢ new experiment and no one need fear |
that it is harmful. It cured John Bruner, j
Postmaster of Millville, Henry County, Ind., ;
and he strongly urges every one to try it. A i
Methodist preacher, Victor A. Faigaux, of

Eintracht Verein Ball.
Hundreds of merry maskers partici
pated in the grand mask ball given by
the Eintracht Verein at Eintracht Hall
last evening. The galleries and all avail
able space which might be used as stand
ing room was crowded with spectators,
and the ball was pronounced a de o c, Â£ > t " <i
success by all present. The hall was fes
tooned a la manii gras and the profusion
of evergreens and soft colors made the
effect far above that of the average hall
decoration. The grand march occurred
at 9 o'clock, after which a series of tab
leaux was shown during the intermission
between dances. The first represented
the Verein Eintracht and its- sections; the
second, the Capitulation of "iorktown: the
third, the Declaration of Independence.;
the fourth, the Blue and the Gray; the
fifth, Our Heroes of the Spanish war,
and the sixth, the Prince and Princess

WAS DEVOID OF HAIR.
PECULIAR PLIGHT OF A SALEM
GIRL ENTIRELY BALD.
What a Trial Package of a
Remedy Did For Her.
The portraits of Miss Emma ?Emond show
what a striking difference is made in a person
when the bald head is covered with hair. Miss
Emond was totally bald, the hair follicles, not
only upon her head, but upon her eyebrows,
being completely contracted, not the sign of a
hair being found. Of course she was the ob-
ject of many experiments, all of which failed,
and the offer of a well-known dispensary to
send a free trial of their remedy was peculiarly
alluring to her. She sent for the free trial, fol-
lowed all directions faithfully and soon she
was rewarded by a growth of hair, which' for
thickness, quality and luxuriance was as re-
markable as the result was gratifying. Miss
Emond lives in Salem, Mass.. at 276 Washing-
ton street, and naturally feels very much elated
to recover from total baldness. An itching
scalp to people who are blessed with hair is a
sign of coming baldness and should be attended
to at once. A.
The remedy that caused Miss Emond s hair
to grow also cures all scalp itching and dis-
eases, removes dandruff and keeps the hair
and scalp healthy and vigorous. Trial pack-
ages are mailed free to ill who write to
the Altenheim Medical Dispensary, 393 Selves

"SOLID SIX"

j Ordinances Expected
on Monday Night.
BIG INCOME DEMANDED
POLITICS ALREADY FIGURES
IN THE DEAL.
â  - â  ?
Memories Revived of the Time When
the Two Companies Were
Fighting Each.
Other.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 18.
On Monday evening the City Council
j will meet, and it is expected that an or
j dinanceâor perhaps j twoâ fixing water
; rates will lie Introduced. One is expected
' from the "solid six," another one from
; the remaining five.
The ordinance will have to deal with a
] new condition, inasmuch as it can no
longer be argued that there are two water
i companies and that the value of one plant
| should serve as a basis for fixing its rev
enue. It is not believed that Mr. Dingee
' will appear before the Council to give
; any evidence this year, as It is understood
he is now out of the water business.
Two years ago the most oft-printed
piece of news was the statement of Presi- j
: dent Dingee that he would never sell out I
' of the Contra Costa Water Company, and |
how the breaking of this promise will j
; affect water rates is now interesting the
people of Oakland.
With three million dollars added to the
original capital of the Contra Costa Water j
j Company an income must now be raised j
that will pay dividends on eight millions of I
dollars, in addition to paying operating
expenses, wear and tear erf plant and sup
plying the "secret fund" found to be nec
essary in the past. Should an attempt be
made to pay 6 per cent on the Investment
it will be necessary to raise, including
operating expenses, an income of $555,000.
That this capitalization is fictitious can
be proved by looking at the data published
two years ago while the companies were j
, cutting each other's throats. Dingee
showed that $950,000 was all the Contra
Costa plant was worth; the Contra Costa
company showed that Dingee's plant was
worth about $750,000. Both concerns stated
that the books kept in their early years
were destroyed, and consequently reliable i
data could be obtained only from engi- J
neers employed by the respective com
panies. While fighting, all these facts j
were brought out, and now the public has '
not forgotten them. ;:.-â¢â .''*-
Some years ago an vmpurchasable Coun- i
ell. after much examination, added large- i
ly to its findings and fixed two million :
and a quarter as a basis upon which to
make rates, as Oakland grew it was j
thought this sum could be cut down a lit
-1 tie each year, as consumers increased.
The water companies took a different j
view, and now seek to have rates fixed on ,
a value many times in excess of the orig- j
inal figures. * Â,,_,. Â j
There is a possibility that a "solid six
may not -be found this year, and after
the experience of last February the pub
lic has little hope of any change. It is
common talk that the water companies
have an active political manager at work,
and that he is busy on the available Dem
ocratic timber of the Council in the in
terests of the consolidation and its de- j
It is easy to see that the water monop- |
oly desires a big rate at this time. Im- j
mediate value must be placed upon the 1
inflated stock, or else the confidence of ;
speculators will be broken. If the pres
ent City Council can be "induced to
make the new stock pay dividends ior the
next year and a half it may be unloaded
to advantage at something near par, and
that Messrs. Jjingee and Hayward, who
hold many thousands.of shares, are anx
ious to unload cannot be doubted.
There seems to be little doubt that the j
Council to be elected next month and
which will fix rates in February, 1900, will
make a schedule that will pay a very
small dividend on the inflated capitaliza
tion of eight millions. Consequently, the
haste to dispose of the stock.
It is not improbable that an attempt to
employ the court to enforce a schedule
that will pay dividends on eight millions
may lead to a positive step on -the part
of the public toward municipal owner
shin This is rendered more probable in
view of the fact that the platforms of
nearly all the political parties contain a
municipal ownership plank.

Love of dress and a desire to lead a

working rancher has caused Mrs. Rose
Enos to leave her home and seek pleasure
in other company than that of her hus

the hope of inducing his wife to be con
tented with her surroundings. He has
not succeeded.
Last Thursday Mr. Enos spent a few
hours in the calaboose at Pleasanton, and
his offense consisted in inflicting punish
ment on the man whom 'he blamed for
his wife's frailty. Three years ago the
couple were married at San Leandro.
They settled down to domestic life in the
I quiet town of San Lorenzo. But this was
| altogether too quiet for the young wife,
; who desired to live somewhere where the
â¢' sun did not regulate the beginning and
end of existence each day.
Anxious to please Mrs. Enos> her hus
i band bought a pretty home on C street,
] at Haywarde, and for a time his wife
â  was contented. But lately a friend from
! Watsonville visited the Enos home, and
; after his departure the little wife was
again discontented.
Mr. Enos, still anxious to please and be
indulgent', permitted his wife to visit
friends at Watsonville, and since then his
home has not known happiness. Last
Thursday a friend called on Mrs. Enos
j while her hard-working husband was in
the field, and induced her to take a buggy
ride to Pleasanton. Enos heard of it
] just in time to catch the train and nip
the elopement in the bud. He found his
man, and a minute later Pleasanton was
the scene of a sanguinary battle. Eno3
won, but his competitor had him arrested
for battery. He was later released and
returned to his desolate home, and now
, declares that he will make no more over
: tures to content Mrs. Enos.

GERMANY'S MEAT
INSPECTION BILL
To Be No Discrimination
Against Imports.
TREATED AS DOMESTIC FOOD
AMENDMENT TO SEND EXPERTS
TO THIS COUNTRY.
Press of the Fatherland Speaks in a
More Friendly Mood of In
creasing Trade With the
United States. '
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Feb. 18.â The meat inspec
tion bill passed by the Bundesrdth on
February 16 provides for an expert In
spection inland before and after
slaughtering cattle, hogs, sheep, goats
and horses, excepting what are killed
for domestic consumption. This is re
garded as only an Agrarian compro
mise. The bill contains many details
of home inspection! It not only ex
cludes diseased meat, but meat of in
sufficient nutritive value. Foreign
meats are subject to a single inspection,
i but this does not forbid an additional
inspection by the separate states for
special reasons, such as suspicion that
the meat has deteriorated since the
date of its first inspection. In any
case, however, foreign meats must be
treated the same as domestic meats.
The importation of foreign meats is re
stricted to certain ports in order to
facilitate inspection, the result of which
must be made known in each case in
a uniform manner. I: v
The bill ls considered to provide the
minimum meat inspection required
throughout the empire, leaving to the
separate states the question of adding
other features besides what are con
tained in the imperial bill.
The measure has now gone to the
Reichstag, where It is certain to lead
to stormy debates. The Center, being
the dominant factor, will propose an
amendment to the effect that Germany
appoint a corps of its own meat in
spectors to go to. Chicago and other
meat exporting centers, these inspect
ors to examine all meat destined for
Germany and issue certificates which
will be accepted as conclusive by the
home government.
Regarding this proposition the Cen
trist organ, the Cologne Yolks Zeltung,
says: "The American packers cannot
object to such an arrangement, for such
hygienio legalization will only be a,
copy, of their present legalization of
German exports to the United States
by the American Consuls here."
The statements of Baron yon Bulow,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
Count Posadowsky- the Min
ister of the Interior, regarding the
commercial and political relations be
tween the United States and Germany
and the debate in the Reichstag on the
subject have occupied the attention of
the press throughout the week and
gave rise to many notable utterances.
The Cologne Yolks Zeltung further
says: "In spite of the clear and un
equivocal declarations of the German
Government we suppose that the Ger
man baiting by the American and Eng
lish press will not cease at once. We
believe, however, that the- frank and
honest remarks of the officials of the
Government will prevent this poisonous
seed from continuing to affect the
views of the thinking and influential
classes In the United States."
. The Deutsche Zeltung publishes a
long editorial article, in the course of
which it says: "German- American â¢ re
lations are difficult to handle. Ameri
can agriculture and German industry
must export, and American industry
and German agriculture need tariff pro
tection. Thus arise most important
economic differences. . The American
desire for expansion and the German
need of expansion "produce new fric
tions, yet neither an economic nor a
political rupture will be in the Interest
of either nation." * v* i 'j
The Frankfort Zeltung. reviewing the
proceedings In the Reichstag says:
"It must be admitted that opinion in
the United States has "unfortunately
had many reasons to doubt Germany's
neutrality. We pointed out on a former
: occasion the needlessness of sending
four German men-of-war to Manila to
protect German interests. Other in
terested powers . deemed, one vessel
enough. And then the larger part 1 of
the press, the semi-official newspapers
Included, gave expression to their sym
pathy for the 'brave and severely tried
people,' which was necessarily offen
sive to the Americans."
The discord within the German and
Prussian Cabinets .has grown, more
acute: There is no longer any doubt
that the three outspoken Agrarian
members of the Prussian 'â Â' Cabinet,
Baron ; yon Hammersteln-Lexten, the
Minister of Agriculture; Baron yon der
Recke yon - der Hoist, the Prussian
Minister of the Interior, and Count yon
PoEadowsky- Wehner, the Secretary of
State for the interior, are openly at
war with the . rest ; of their colleagues.
During the past fortnight they have
given ample evidence. thereof In public
speeches, ;in some . cases flatly contra
dicting previous statements of Baron
yon > Bulow, Baron yon Thielman, Sec
retary of the Imperial Treasury, and
Dr. Bosse, Minister of Instruction, and
other Ministers. It is not yet known
how- it will all end, with the retirement
of one faction, or with a fresh compro
mise. Some of the newspapers predict
the retirement of the three Agrarians.
Baron yon Bulow, it is understood,
continues to enjoy the full confidence
of the Emperor, who holds that foreign
office interests must be allowed to pre
dominate, at any rate for the time, be
ing, In view of the important and deli
cate negotiations which are proceeding
with several of the powers, especially
with the United States. The officials
of the American Embassy here have
made representations to the German
Government in behalf of American pe
troleum interests. About a year ago
the German Government announced
that there was grave danger of an
American monopoly in Germany, and
that the Government therefore would
facilitate the import of Russian petrol
eum. Since then the Prussian state
railroads have begun to use exclusive
ly Russian petroleum. However, by a
recent administrative measure, the
flash test has been raised in Prussia
and other German states which
amounts to a virtual discrimination
against American oil. The American
Embassy took exception to these mea
sures, but it was fruitless. The Ger
man newspapers now assert that the
Standard Oil Company and the Russian
companies have come to an agreement
and that the Government will shortly
be interpellated regarding the steps to
be taken to counteract the threatened
revival of the monopoly.
Emperor William has pardoned
Henry Tiedemann of New York, a Ger
man-American who deserted from the
Prussian army in 1850 and went to the
United States, where he became nat
uralized and built up a prosperous
business in New York. Recently he
was arrested while on a visit to his
relatives in Germany and was court
martialed and sentenced to several
years* imprisonment, although the of
fense was committed before he went to
America, and he therefore was not
amenable to the treaty provisions.
The American Embassy, however,
made representations with happy re
sults. '.<y'i.-y '?.. . .
The Emperor this week ordered from

NICARAGUA GANAL PROJECT
IT HAS AROUSED CONSIDER
ABLE OPPOSITION.
: ; '
An Amendment to the Appropriation
Bill That Is Likely to Delay
Much Needed Legis
lation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â Chairman
Burton of the River and Harbor Com
mittee stated to-day that he feared the
river and harbor bill would fall to be
come a law, as the result of the action
of the Senate Commerce Committee in
adding the Nicaragua canal amend
ment. "J * yy
"I am not opposed to the Nicaragua
canal," said Burton, "but it is a vast
project, to be approached with due de
liberation and not carried along as a
'rider' with perhaps only a few min
utes' consideration. Every item of the
original bill was carefully scrutinized
by the committee, but it will be im
possible if this amendment comes back
to give It the like scrutiny. in the few
remaining days of Congress or to recon
cile it with the original character of the
bill. Viewed from a practical stand
point the amendment creates a com
bination of opposing elements, the op
position to any river a.id harbor bill,
the opposition to any Nicaragua canal,
the opposition to this form of dealing
with the Nicaragua canal, the opposi
tion of such men as Cannon to heavy
expenditures, and the opposition of the
Senate to increase the river and harbor
items. Altogether I am seriously ap
prehensive that these combined ele
ments of opposition will defeat the
river and harbor bill and the Nicara
guan canal amendment as well."
It is expected that a test will be made
on the bill If the Senate retains the
Nicaragua canal paragraph, when it
reaches the House. The usual pro
cedure would be to disagree to the Sen
ate amendments as a whole and ask for
a conference. But in this case friends
of the Nicaragua canal say there will
be a motion either, to concur, with the
canal amendment or. else to instruct the
House conferees to substitute the Hep
burn canal bill.
Chairman Hepburn and other mem
bers of the Commerce Committee do
not approve -the form of the Senate
canal amendment, and it is said to
recognize private concessions. They
therefore will endeavor to preserve the
Nicaragua feature in the .river and
harbor bill and yet substitute strict
government control as embodied in the
Hepburn bill. The precedents are be
ins examined, and under these It is said
the motion to concur with an amend
ment substituting the House proposi
tion for that of the Senate would take
precedence over a motion to non-con
cur.. The most recent ruling was by
Payne, who, while In the chair, held
that a motion to concur with an amend
ment took precedence over a strict mo
tion to concur and the latter over a
motion to non-concur. â¢.

A NEW TROUBLE CONFRONTS
DR. ALFRED SANDER.

ALAMEDA, Feb. \ 18.â Dr. Alfred * San

thinks the fates are against him when
they have anything to |do with his love
affairs. Last week he went on the war
path in search of reporters because the
particulars of one of his affairs had found
their way into print. The story was an
old one, known to nearly every Alame
dan. The doctor did not so much object
to the yarn in itself as he did to its ap
pearance on the eve of his wedding to
Miss Ruth Martha Gruenberg. He found
solace for his wounded feelings "by threat
ening to shoot every member of the Ala
meda newspaper fraternity.
Dr. Sander's wedding is set for to-mor
row. The feast has been prepared, the
floral marriage bell and other accessories
to a function of the kind are in readiness,
but they will not be used. A misfortune
far .worse than a newspaper story has
Intervened to mar the doctor's happiness.
The wedding arrangements have been dis
organized by a well developed case of
measles that made its appearance during
the night. : .--. ; 'â â â  -â ?Â±':-;j~z 'â  ; â â â  â :</. â -- '
It was with sad demeanor that Dr. San
der notified the Health Department that
his Intended bride had fallen a victim
to the epidemic that is now prevalent in
Alameda. For fear that some new trouble
may present itself, the man of medicine
hits determined that the wedding cere
mony will be performed to-morrow, even
though the feast and festivities arranged
for the occasion must be dispensed with. â¢
Miss Gruenberg is very sick to-night,
and although her Illness is by no means
serious it is possible that it may be suf
ficiently severe to make a postponement
of the wedding Imperative.

LIEUTENANT NEALL IS
ALIVE AND A FUGITIVE
He Did Not Accept Death as the
Penalty for His Dishonor as
v .y_
" His Friends Feared. '
The Authorities at the Presidio Are in Ignorance of
the Officer's Flight and Are Still Searching the
Hills for His Body.
LIEUTENANT JOHN M. NEALL is
not dead. He has fled from the city
to bury his shame and dishonor and
to escape the penalty that the law
Inflicts upon a thief. Where he has gone
no one knows, as he feared to intrust the
secret of his destination even to his clos
est friends. Not even the military offi
cers of the Presidio know that the dis
graced soldier is alive, but eyes keener
than those of the searchers in the Pre
sidio hills saw Lieutenant Neall leave the
reservation on "Wednesday afternoon
when he knew that his accounts were to
be examined and in a few hours he would
be known as a thief. After leaving the
Presidio he came into the city and then
went no one knows where.
The news of the disgrace of Lieutenant â 
Neall continues to be the sensation of :
the day in the circles in which the soldier
moved. The story of his fall is now :
known in all its details. There was much i
more than the theft of a few thousand j
dollars to force the lieutenant to sacri- |
flee the honorable record of his past and j
. the brilliant prospect of his future. He
had financially involved himself so deeply
that there was practically no hope that i
he could with his income extricate him- j
self. The crash came of course with the
certainty of exposure of canteen frauds
and then Lieutenant Neall fled.
On Wednesday afternoon Major Edward I
Field, inspector general at the Presidio, |
informed .Neall that he should prepare
himself for the Inspection of his books.
The annual inspection was in progress
and Major Field had twice made the same
demand upon Neall and the third brought
the climax. A few minutes after it was
made Neall left the reservation. Mes
sages were sent, but he could not be
found. He had not waited even to change
his uniform and left $1400 in the safe of
the canteen.
Lieutenant Neall's books were not ex
ported until Thursday, when Colonel C. E.
Compton, Major Edward Field and Post \
Adjutant F. W. Harris made an examina
tion and discovered that Lieutenant Neall !
was $3500 short in his accounts. This con- j
elusion of the examiners is not final, as I
the Inspection of the accounts was not ab- j
solutely thorough. It will be completed i
by order of Colonel Compton before to- |
morrow night. The following Board of
Survey was appointed for the purpose yes- '
terday afternoon: Captain h. O. Danes,
Battery I, Third Artillery^ First Lieuten
ant Thomas H. Slavens, Troop H, Fourth
Cavalry; Second Lieutenant J. J. Boni
face, Troop B, Fourth Cavalry. Colonel
Compton also telegraphed yesterday after
noon to General Shatter, informing him
of the disappearance and shortage. Ref
erence was made in this telegram only to
the shortage of $3500 ln the canteen ac
count, as the military authorities as such
are concerned with that and not with the
theft of $1000 from the Presidio Ciub.
"When the board of survey finishes its
work it will submit the report to the head
of the department.
It will be discovered that a curious con- !
dition of affairs exists in the Presidio can- j
teen. Lieutenant Neall was able to filch ;
what he did for the simple reason that J
he did not have to render a monthly ac- j
count of finances to any authority mat |
â¢might have been a check upon his dis
honesty. When Lieutenant Nolan died it
was impossible to arrange the finances of
the canteen and Mrs. Nolan held several
Â©f her husband's checks and would not de
liver them until some legal method of do
ing so was suggested. Her husband had
' been canteen officer and she very properly
wished to protect herself.
' When Lieutenant Neall became Nolan's
successor he did not have to make, there
. fore, a statement that would have re
vealed his ill-doing. He received two
* months' grace in which to steal, and he
seized the opportunity.
* While the officials of the Presidio were
busy yesterday afternoon examining
Neall's "accounts, other officers and men
were traversing the hills and wooded re
cesses of the reservation seeking and
fearing to find the body of the missing
lieutenant. The task was a hateful one
for the men who had been comrades and
friends of Neall. Each assumed his duty,
however, and several searching parties
were formed. Neall, as a matter of
course, could not be found. He had
sought no escape from his shame by
death, but those that knew him and were
won by his good-fellowship believed he
.had made away with himself.
. One effort of the searchers created a
particular and gloomy interest. On the
Presidio reservation there is an old, un
used, dangerous gas and poison laden tun

nel that extends Into the hill for perhaps
700 yards. It was thought that Lieutenant
Neall had crawled Into its depths to seek
death. Four soldiers familiar with mining
volunteered, therefore, to enter the tunnel
and search. They penetrated into the
darkness until the overpowering odor of
gas warned that further progress would
mean death. They retired with the argu
ment that Lieutenant Neall could not
have gone much farther, even if he had
sought what they avoided. It was only
when darkness came that the search was
abandoned and the seekers turned from
the hills and the bay shore.

to be found. It has been suggested that
he came into the city on Wednesday after
noon, purchased a civilian's dress and
then, practically disguised, fled. He had
about $100 in his possession when he left
the Presidio. It was said that he called
at the Occidental Hotel to see his intimate
friend. Lieutenant B. X. Smith. This is
denied, however, at the hotel. It is per
haps an interesting coincidence that Lieu
tenant Smith left for his home at Salt
Lake on the very night that Lieutenant
Neall absconded from the Presidio.
The whole affair has created a profound
sensation in Federal army circles, par
ticularly over the fact that Neall was
permitted to handle money not his own
when his superiors knew he was in finan
cial straits, was being hounded by mer
chants and others, and had standing
against his credit as a gentleman more

tention. General Shafter was interviewed
at Bakersfield last night by a representa
tive of The Call. , ,_ , , '
General Shatter said that he received' a
message late yesterday afternoon inform
ing him that "Lieutenant Neall. had been
missing for. two days, and that an , in
spection of his books at the Presidio
showed him to be $3500 short in the can
teen funds. The general said he had not
learned of a thousand dollars being miss
ing from the Presidio Club fund. The
general was surprised at the reported
action of Neall. whom he considered as
absolutely trustworthy. General Shafter
said he had known him for twenty-five
years, since he was second lieutenant. He
was always square in his dealings and
perfectly sober. The general said he was
aware, however, that Neall was in debt
and in need of money, but he did not
think his obligations exceeded a few hun
dred dollars. Neall was not extravagant.

The Pacific Mastiff Club held a well-at
tended meeting last night, at which it
was decided to offer the following special
prizes for competition by members of the
San Francisco Kennel Club's bench show
in May:
The Pacific Mastiff Club's competition
trophyâ a, silver mastiffâ for the best mas
tiff, irrespective of sex, to be competed
for annually at San Francisco until won
three times by the same member.'*
The club's competition gold medal for
best mastiff of opposite sex to winner of
trophy, to be competed for annually at
San Francisco until won three times by
the same member.

going prizes. AAA
The Pacific Mastiff Club trophy for the
best California-bred mastiff, the club's

The St. Bernard Club of California
meets to-morrow night for the purpose
of deciding on the special prizes it will
offer at the bench show. In point of time
it will be forty-eight hours behind the
mastiff club, but as it has a larger mem
bership It is expected It will offer more
numerous and more valuable prizes than
the latter. â .y

The meeting last night in Native Sons'

Alexander Balena, convicted of passing
counterfeit half-dollars, was sentenced by
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday to imprisonment at "hard la
bor" In the San Quentin Penlteniary for
six months and to pay a fine ' of - $100. - His
sentence was made light on the interces
sion of the Secret Service agents, on the
ground that he was a cripple and that
they were convinced that he was not a
counterfeiter, but the tool of a gang which
they expect to unearth in the near future.
Balena is a widower with a daughter
15 years old. and during her father's Incar
ceration she will be cared for by the
mother of Secret Service Agent Cronin

CALIFORNIA CAN
NOW CLAIM THE
PRIZE CARNATION
A Local Bloom Wins
at Philadelphia.
BEAT 'THE LAWSON" WONDER
THAT $30,000 BEAUTY MUST
TAKE SECOND PLACE.
Horticulturist Sievers Receives a
Dispatch Which Vindicates
the State as the Garden
Spot of the World.
John H. Sievers* carnation, the "Hanna
Hobart," has received first certificate at
the annual exhibition of the National Car
nation Society now in session in Phila
delphia. Mr. Sievers received a telegram
from A. M. Herr, vice president of the
society, that the California flower ."scored
eighty-six pointsâ a winner."
Carnations from the whole country, not
excepting the now famous "Mrs. Thomas
Lawson," which was sold for $30,000 in
Boston recently, were in the competition.
The flower Itself, as well as the obstacles
overcome in placing it in the Eastern
market, has been a revelation of what
California can accomplish.
This is the first California flower to be
entered in an Eastern exhibition in com
petition with Eastern flowers. - yr-
Mr. Sievers said: "I sent a few* flowers
to the last exhibition as an experiment.
The society requires fifty flowers cut and
a plant in bloom of each species en
tered. You can see that it is not easy to
have our flowers arrive in good shape
after a six days' journey. Really, I did
not believe it could be done successfully,
neither did my friends."
"But you tried it?"
"Yes; but of course the flowers are not
at their best. Last year, at the same ex
hibition where the "Mrs. Thomas ' Law
son" flower which brought $30,000 won first
place, the official report said that my
flowers, the "Hanna Hobart,*' were the
largest and finest ever exhibited. By ac
tual linear measurement, as given in the
report, the California flower is about an
inch larger In. circumference.
"But size is not all:
"Not at all; it is very little." He showed
the scale of points of the -exhibition by
which the judges of the carnation society
grade the flowers.
The scale to be used for the Judging of
seedlings is* as follows: â¢ -

"You must know that when flowers are
six days old they have deteriorated in
color substance and the perfume is quite

quality of a flower." Hanna Hobart?"
"Will you sell the Hanna Hobart?
' "If any flower is worth $30,000, this one
la and it is worth more to us than to any
one else. Here is what Mr. Lawson says
about it: .A. -A]
I made my offer to Mr. Galvln, after reading
of the attempts of Chicago and New York men
to transplant this beautiful flower to DM
both of these great hurly burly modern Baby
lons I made it on the spur of the moment,
because I was touched by the pathos of the
picture. . â  Â
. Some of the dealers and growers of your city
say that no flower ls actually worth what they
term the extravagant price I have paid, Senti
ment aside, I know a little something about
flowers and know considerable about carna
tions and I am a business man who knows
going rates of money, and I will say to my
critics that I can realize more than double the
amount I have invested for the sale of my
SOOO plants. <
Mr. Lawson says besides in an open
letter: ' . â¢ '- A-A'AyA
Some of your growers say there are as fine
carnations as the Mrs. Thomas W. Lawson
raised to-day in New York.- Speaking gener
ally. I have never seen the equal of things
floral that I have seen In Long Island or Tarry
town, but in my opinion there is not in New
York or any other part of America the equal
of the Mrs". Thomas W. Lawson carnation.
If there is, kindly cause it to be produced, and
I will pay its grower $5000 for a single flower,
not plant, and, in addition, if he has 8000
plants, I will purchase th entire flower,
products and rights, and will pay $30,000 for
them Again, if any one will grow a carnation
finer than the Mrs. Thomas W. Lawson any
time before February 1. 1900, I will pay to him
the sum of $5000 as a prize.
"Are you intending to offer him the
Hanna Hobart?" ,Â«- ,' â ..
"I shall be very glad to sell him a
flower for $5000, and will send one to him.
But I do not intend to sell the rights to
the flower until I have produced a better
one." 'â  'â¢*'â !
"And you can produce a better one?
"Undoubtedly! Undoubtedly! Look at
the -chrysanthemum! When a flower
brings iii $30,000 we can afford to give : a
great amount of time and money to its
cultivation. Shipping is as great a prob
lem to me just now. These flowers I sent
by Wells-Fargo. They were placed each
flower in a separate glass tube. The tube
was fastened * Into a * tin case and filled
with water. The water was not changed
in transit nor for the exhibition. I pre
ferred to use the California water be
cause I was afraid of a strange water. I
did not know how it might affect the
flowers." .

JACOB J. PFRANG AND SPOUSE
FIGHT IN A SALOON.
She Knocked Him Down and He
Plunged the Knife Into Her
Left Shoulder ahd Neck.
Jacob J. Pfrang, a piano player living at
197 A Shipley street, and his wife, Celia,
were drinking at the bar in William Cluck's
saloon, 723 Howard street, yesterday after
noon, when a quarrel ensued as to im
biblng too much "booze," as Mrs. Pfrang
expressed it.
They called each other offensive names
and Mrs. Pfrang, who is a powerfully
built woman, smote her husband on the
jaw and knocked him down. Pfrang
sprang to his feet, and pulling a bowle
knife out of his pocket, plunged it into his
wife's left shoulder and neck. The woman
fell and Pfrang rushed out of the saloon.
leaving his hat behind him. Mrs. Pfrang
was carried into- a -rear room.
Detectives Ryan and ODea happened
to be standing on the corner of Third and
Howard streets at the time and some one
told them that a stabbing affray had oc
curred in Cluck's saloon. They ran to the
place, but Pfrang had disappeared. They
took possession of his hat and bowie
knife and sent Mrs. Pfrang t:. the Receiv
ing Hospital, while they commenced a
search for Pfrang.
At the hospital Dr. Thompson attended
to the woman's wounds, none of which he
considers dangerous, as the lungs .ap
parently not been touched. \N hen Mrs.
Pfrang" was asked what the trouble was
about she laconically replied. 'Booze.
She sent a telephone message to her
brother, Al. Murley, a driver at the Lnlon
Iron Works, to come and see her.

I In this case, "â  strange to say, the com

ford's account of the remarkable man
ner in which the vision arrived, as she
delivered it on 'her death: bed to the
Archbishop of Dublin: _ , AyAy\

mutual promise?'* replied he. 'Know

religion by which we â¢ can be â  saved. I

that you will :be blessed- with g a son.

This was all right, but Lady; Beres

an ; assurance ' that â¢ the . visitation r, -was
real ; and "â  not ; a dream. C The Â» ghost â¢ re- j
plied: "You are hai i of belief.' Hold out

"while you live let no mortad eye be

It is superfluous to remark that from
this aAvful interview to the day of her
death Lady Beresford wore a black
ribbon round her wrist. She is always
represented wearing this .badge in the
ancestral portrait gallery. Â§ Also every
other prediction of the specter came
true. â  Her husband died, she remarried,

In solid vein.
The Isabella mine of Cripple Creek
has undisputed possession of all this
wealth. Even the "gob-stuff," or what
one may choose to refer to as loav grade
ore, will run anywhere from $1000 to
$20,000 per ton. The reader's imagina
tion may be enlivened as to .the possi
ble profit of this mine when it is known
that gold ore at $10 a ton, Avhen found
in sufficient quantities, is considered' a
bonanza. These sound like big stories,
don't they? Almost too big to be
"fakes," even in Colorado. I V.
The owners of this mine are not at
all excited. They have no need to be,
and so are very placid indeed. They
have the gold. They can control the
whole, for out of 2,250,000 shares a Chi
cago syndicate has pooled 1,300,000, or
enough to enable 'them to dictate the
destiny of the property. They can close
down the mine to-morrow to bear the
stock," and then, when they buy in at
their OAvn price, they can reopen and
dig out the glittering treasure. This is
not likely, for the company has Just
passed through the throes of threatened
litigation and narrowly escaped it at
the annual meeting. The minority is
decidedly dissatisfied, and if there be
the slightest loop-hole it will be made
exceedingly warm for the majority. The
latter are well fortified, and have been
trying for three years to acquire con
trol. When they laid their plans their
wildest flights of fancy did not even

Nelson B. Williams began picking up
the- stock three years ago, when the
property was owned entirely by Colo
rado Springs capitalists, who resided
just the other side of Pikes Peak, which
o'ershadows the mine. Count Pourtales,
who is considered a very shrewd finan
cier; Percy and J. J. Hagerman, and a
number of prominent Colorado Springs
mining men and railroad investors were
identified with the Isabella. They had
lots of experience and foresight, and
had piloted many a deal through ob
stacles that usually. beset the capitalist
and promoter. In spite of all this they
allowed an Illinois tenderfoot to ac
quire possession of what is probably
the only mine in the world that carries
pure gold.
It must not really be supposed that
the Avhole mine is all gold, but there
is & very goodly quantity of the real
yellow metal in sight. A prominent "
mining engineer estimates the aJl^unt
at $6,000,000. He also figures out '.here
are as many millions of low grade stuff.
This bewitched mine is right on the
spot here "five thousand miners cursed
and execrated a couple of Denver
sharpers who led them into the belief
that gold was to be found at the foot .
of Mount Plsgah. This was in 1884.
The Denver men had salted a hole, sent
the news to Leadville, then the center
of the Little Pittsburg excitement, and
stampeded the crowd of treasure seek
ers from Leadville to. Mount .Pisgah,
one hundred and fifty miles away. They
came in such a body miners, metallur

of selling a lot of worthless land and
fled during the night to escape lynching

guarded it. There was one homestead
on it when Robert Womack began pros

j to the owner "of the ranch that the lives
of range riders and of cattle were
greatly endangered by the many holes
that Womack was persistently digging
over the property. He did not quite like
the formation, however," and was about
to give up his work when one day he
picked up a rock to throw at an ob
stinate steer that was roaming in the
vicinity of his claim. The weight of
the stone amazed him. With another
rock he quickly broke it -open ' and. he
found the inside fairly glistening with

One may naturally suppose he was
intensely excited over this discovery.'

and found it $2500 per ton. The news of
this strike caused prospectors to come
in crowds from all parts of the State;
It must be confessed, though, on - ac
count of the Mount Pisgah deception,
that they were a little suspicious, and
would have made short work of Wo

A town was platted out on eighty

Brigham Young's Tenth Wife
and Her Opinion of Polygamy
WHEN I received an invitation
to spend the evening at Zion
House' with Brigham Young's
tenth wife, I felt myself the
most favored woman in Salt
Lake City.
It had taken considerable effort on
the part of several prominent ladies of
the Mormon capital to secure for me
the few words which promised me a
welcome at one of the most historic
houses in the West. . Mormonistic ideas
are deep-seated, and it is - difficult to
break through the barriers that the
strange religion has built around the
"elect." . y^A-A:-
The last bit of advice given me by my
interested friends as we stood in the
winter moonlight before the massive
double doors awaiting an answer to our
summons was: "Now, do be careful
what you say, and, for mercy's sake,
don't let any one even dream that you
are a writer." "AAA.-
I promised faithfully to mind my
p's and q's, for I remembered hearing
how a very interesting, conversation
had come to an untimely and most un
satisfactory conclusion a few days be
fore when one of President Young's
AviA'e^had been silenced by the thought
less question of a Chicago girl.
Miss Chicago had listened with
breathless attention to her hostess. At
a most interesting point in Mrs.
Young's narrative the girl had ex
claimed:
''â¢Oh, but weren't you just fairly con
sumed with jealousy?" . "-
. .-â¢ "When such thoughts and tempta
tions entered our lives we had to crush
them, that was all,'.' had been Mrs.
Young's thoughtful replyâ but here had
ended the interview. V Ay* A'
Presently: footsteps were heard In
the hall, and the door was opened by a
frail-looking woman In black, who held
a lighted lamp in her hand, forming a
striking foreground for the deepening
shadows that filled the hallway beyond.
This was Mrs. Margret Youngâ
"Aunt Margret," as she is often called
by her associates. Over her ; shoulder ?
peered the face of a young and pretty
girl, a guest of the Zion House, as we
afterward learned. My friends being
old acquaintances of Mrs. Young, . we
received a cordial welcome.
Following Mrs. Young and the flick
ering light of her lamp, we were ush
ered through "a: wide hallway that ? ex
tended, the entire length of the great
house. At the farther end we, reached
the room used, upon ; this occasion, at
least, by our hostess as ' her reception
hall. The room evidently was usable
as parlor, dining-room 'and, kitchen." It
was 20x20 feet, with windows looking
toward the Desert News building, the
abode ; of the official church newspaper.

We found Aunt Margret in a pleasant
mood. She is a kindly old lady of the
average farmwife type of fifty years
ago. No one AA'ould dream,, from her
surrroundings, bearing or â¢ appearance
that she was the wife of one so great
in church, state or social position as
Brigham Young. Many a day, laborer's
wife has more . of life's pleasures and
sunshine than President Young's wife
seemed to possess. "
The husband was mentioned as
"President Young," and she spoke of
him as one would of some ; person of
power and prominence to whom fate
had , considerably given some distant
claim of relationship. "' *â  ?"*;
We' were told of the early days, the
trip across. the plains, the trials of the
handcart â  system * of â¢ traveling and of
flights from and encounters with the
rebellious Indian Inhabitants. Mrs.
Young dwelt ? long upon the hardships
and religious criticisms "President
Young" had ; endured. The buildine of
the Zion House, her present abode, the
Tabernacle,' Temple and Assembly Hall
were topics that delighted . her soul.
Through all the conversation flowed the
current , of hero-worship with which
Mrs. Young covered Brigham's doings.
To observe "this tenth wife, and to
note the worshipful attitude of her con
versation toward one who is known to
have given her but a scanty amount of
affection, . gives an idea of the mastery
held by the Mormon ? husbands over
their wives. Margret Young had never
been even a moderately- favored wife.
She had given no children to ' : her lord
and master, by whose 'â â ' numbers his
earthly, and heavenly dominion > and
glory should be increased.
Margret Young's life, she told us. had
been devoted to the : raising of six, of
"President Youngs. - children, whose
mothers had died. That she. had done

Joining the ground on the east is the
well-known Victor mine. ..which has
paid since its organization as a stock
company $1,250,000, and is still paying
dividends, at the rate of $100,000 every
three months,. or 50 cents a share. The
principal producer of the Isabella group
until recently has been the Buena
Vista, which is now opened up to a
depth of 700 feet. Very little ore has
been stoped on the long vein below the
500 foot point.
The Buena Vista was located by Sam
Dougherty, a stonemason of Colorado
Springs, in September. 1891. In doing
his assessment Avork he uncovered a
vein and chute, but it was badly broken
up. .-. He deeded a one-half interest in
the property in November of the same
year to Billy Steele and John Blair. The
consideration was that his partner
should sink an additional twenty feet.
November 27, 1891, Count James Pour
tales, then a resident of Colorado
Springs, but now of Germany, paid $55,
--000 for the lode. It then showed, at a
depth of thirty feet, twelve inches of
sixty dollar ore. The sale created a
big sensation among mining men
throughout the State and country, and
as- it was the first big deal consum
mated in the new camp Cripple. Creek
received a great deal of - advertising
from it. Investors reasoned that the t
new camp must be a wonder, and they
were right. Dougherty, Steele and
Blair received half cash, the balance
being paid in shares in the new com
pany at the rate of 10 cents per share.
Steele arid Blair opened up a magnifi
cent*saloon.in Cripple Creek and made
money for a few /years. They, sold out
in the 'boom* of 1892 and went back to
.their old J homes in Missouri. Dough
erty still holds 40,000 shares of the stock
and is independently rich.
â¢â¢ '.-Soon, 'after.'. the purchase Count Pour
. tales I interested J. J. Hagerman, then
the silver king of -Colorado, who was
receiving hundreds of thousands of dol
lars in dividends each month from his
famous Mollie Gibson silver mine at
Aspen. The Isabella Company was in
corporated and a large acreage sur
rounding the Buena Vista was taken
in, either by cash purchase or by
shares in the new corporation. Among
the people who held a number of claims
surrounding the Buena Vista were the.
McKay brothers. Norman .and Dan.

On our departure Mrs. Young ac
companied us to the door, lighting the
way as before. Holding the lamp in
one hand, she extended the other in
blessing upon the head of a maiden of
7, in our party, saying:
â¢"Child, you must always ' remember
that you have spent an evening in the
home of President Young." -
Adjoining the Zion House is the Bee
Hive, another of Mr. Young's "homes,"
where more of his wives are said to
have "dwelt happily together." Di
rectly .opposite these dwellings stands
the Gardo House, known also as
"Amelia's Palace." Here dwelt Brig
ham and his : favorite wife, Amelia,
This was the state residence. It must
have been a source of anything hut
pleasure to the . wives just over the
way to gaze upon the elegant and mod
ern home their husband had built for
Amelia. To their weary hearts' content
they could watch their husband as he
lingered, during â¢ the balmy twilight
hours (for which Salt Lake City is
justly famed) -in the . lovely and frag
rant garden surrounding the palace
with the well-beloved and stylishly
gowned Amelia.
Amelia is said to be the only woman
who retained a mind and will of her
own after marriage, and of her the fol
lowing story is told: When sewing
machines 'were among desirable gifts
Mr. Young purchased one as a surprise
for this particular wife. â  When the
gift reached . the house Amelia was
away. . Mr. Young hastened to flnd her,
anxious to receive the words of praise
his gift should bring. The machine had
been ' placed on the landing * above a

Amelia, 'followed by her husband, ran

country, was appointed to take charge
of the Isabella ground.
In the summer of 1892, when he com
menced operations, he found â¢an in
debtedness of $75,000 and very little ore
in sight. The old incline shaft on the
Buena Vista Avas continued down and -|
levels opened every eighty feet. In De- I
? cember, 1895, the first dividend of 1 ,
cent per share, or $22,500, was paid. In
the next eighteen months $270,000 was
distributed among shareholders and .
then dividends were stopped. At the
400 foot point, or fifth level, the old
Buena Vista rich . chute was lost. A
ereat deal of crosscutting and drifting
and sinking was done, but that chute
could not be located. ; or, if it was, the
high values had disappeared. In the
meantime Hagerman disposed of his
stock to French investors at about 50
cents per share. At that time is was
considefed a high price. In February
1898-. a new board of directors was
chosen and Nelson B. Williams of Chi
cago elected president. February 1,
when George M. Kilborn took charge of . .
the mine, he found very little ore
? blocked out in the different levels.
He managed, however, to take out
enough to meet the monthly payroll,
while he kept the vast majority of
miners employed on development worK.
In November, in a cross cut from the
'.Buena Vista fissure, at the ninth, or
660 foot level, the new vein and ore
V chute was entered. It was kept very
ouiet, and Williams and associates
picked up all the stock they wanted at
from 20 to 30 cents per share. The first
shipment of ? high grade ore from the
new vein was sent out on December 24.
It consisted of sixty-five tons, and it
averaged $1020 per ton. Since that time
â  half a dozen or more shipments of sim
ilarly rich ore have been marketed. The
same chute and vein has been opened
in cross cuts at the fifth and seventh
levels,:, 400 and 200. feet, respectively,,
above the ninth level. "â¢ â '.'â â 
The Big Strike.
In running the drift at the seventh
level on the vein, Avhich is here about
six feet wide, there was a streak of
quartz and sand encountered that as
says all the way from $7000 to as high
as $96,600 per ton. This chute appears .
to be over 150 feet in length. The phe
nomenally rich ore encountered in the
stope last Saturday is holding out and
is gradually lengthening and widening.
There is now a streak of metallic ore
three feet Avide and twenty-five feet in
length, eighteen inches of which is al
most solid sylvanite, and the other half
an oxidized, rusty and native gold rock .
that is even richer. â â ',- Â
This sudden riches is simply adding
another chapter to the fascinating his
tory of mining in the West. Where one
"strikes it rich" a hundred never strike
it at â¢: all, but one may be certain, in
the case of the man who does strike it,
that he did not find fortune by , any
other means than? patience, â¢ persever
ance and pluck The history of mining
in Colorado is replete with such in
stances as the Isabella has just fur
nished, and stories of 'the well-known
men and mines have been told and re
told, but the most Interesting ones are
those that rarely reach, the? newspapers,
because they lie out of the path which
the average newspaper man treads
when in the West, and so are seldom
heard of in the East.
In the mountains of Colorado, scat
tered about among the villages and *
towns which for the most part contain
its mining population, a-e scores of
men who have located claims and cling
to them in the fond faith that some day
they will bring their owners wealth and
ease and enjoyment. If the "property"
be silver, it is held by doing on It each
year the one hundred dollars' worth of
development work which the Govern
ment requires, in the hope that silver
wilL be again "restored." Then silver
will be profitable to mine in small
operations. Now the ore must be of
good value, easily reduced, and the
operation must be conducted on a scale
which places It beyond the reach of
any but a wealthy individual or com
bination to conduct.

enough to actually discover the very

Jhe Flight of Birds.
The. speed of the flight of birds Is
often overestimated. The late Dr.
Gottke of England supposed that mi
grating birds traveled at the rate of
180 miles an hour, which is almost cer
tainly impossible; and estimates of 140
and 150 miles an hour are frequently
made. I -
A recent flight of * carrier .pigeons
from r? the Shetland .Isles to London
brought out a sustained speed of 37
miles an hour for 16 hours'. This, how
ever, Included stops for rests and prob
ably a good deal of circling to spy out
the way, for a pigeon does not fly
straight "to the mark. Better speed
was once made from Paris to Spa â 250
miles, in 5 hours, but even this gives no
hint of what a pigeon could do over a
measured ten miles. Some authorities
put their speed as high as 100 miles an
hour; it is certainly very nearly that.
Sir Ralph Payne Galloway estimates
â  the flight of a teal duck at 140 miles
an hour, but this again is doubtless in
excess of the truth. It is well known
that when gales exceed 40 miles an
hour only the strongest flylne birds can
make much headway against the wind.
Any one who has traveled at a mile
a minute on the pilot of an engine
knows that the air resistance is felt as
an almost crushing force.
Audubon, the. naturalist, once shot in
Louisiana some pigeons in whose crops
he found rice of a kind which couldn't
have been eaten nearer than South
Carolina, 350 miles away. From the
state of digestion of the rice, he con
cluded that it had been eaten six hours
earlier. Hence he figured out a speed
of a mile a minute for the whole dis
tance, though manifestly such compu
tations cannot be very reliable. He
placed the speed of wild ducks at 45
miles an hour.
In general, it is nit believed that any
bird ever flew more than 100 miles an
hour, though it may be true. The
swifter birds can certainly do from
sixty to ninety miles, perhaps more,
and almost any bird forty to fifty miles
*an hour A frequent source of error
in estimating bird flight is the fact that
at an even rate of speed a small bird
seems to be going much faster than a
big one. Â''â ';,. -, ' ...
The carrier pigeon, the frigate bird,
the falcon and the eagle are the cham
pions among big birds. - The swallow Is

In the early days, when the big, lum- !

. and valuables, the "road agent" Avas a
fixed feature in the life of the great
West. They Avere a regular bonanza ,
; for the bandits when the virgin wealth ,
of the mountains was first disturbed
..by the miner's pick and the treasure
â¢ was being shipped out of the moun
:â¢ .tains to San Francisco and other set
â¢ tlements.
â¢ An occasional report from the moun
-. tain counties of a stage robbery serves
â¢â  to remind the public that the mountain
. [bandit still exists, and that the rail
*. road has not entirely replaced the old
â¢ ."six-horse vehicle as a means of com
munication with the miners. Only last
week the news came down from Jack
,â¢'"â¢ son that two desperate robbers had at
â¢ .tacked the driver and "shotgun"

'â¢'to go back and assist in hunting down

â¢ â¢ sisted on taking him to Stockton. Avhere
.he could be cared for by his family.
â¢ McConnell drove a stage between
"' " Stockton and Sacramento before the
railroad was built: On July 4. 1871. when
â¢ the first passenger train reached Mil
. ton over the Stockton and Copperopolis
road, he took out the stage from the
-terminal point and used to double be
tween Mokelumne Hill and the railroad
' terminus. While driving along on the
,!â¢ trip of January 6, 1872, he Avas stopped
" by a lone highwayman near North
-America and politely asked to drop out
--.the treasure box. As the robber was
â¢ behind a tree and undoubtedly had the

adventure. The money Avas from the
" â¢ Sheep Ranch mine in Calaveras County,
â¢at that time owned by Ferguson &
-. Wallace. McConnell never met this

'â¢' Brooks.
' On March 5, 1872, a bandit named
'Lawlor stopped McConnell at the same

"the seat with the driver. He had put

â â¢* more than a scare, however. Bob

'â¢â¢"on the seat heard the ominous* clicks
'.'â  plainly from both directions. About
..-this time old man Wheat of Double
' Springs overtook the stage. He was on
- horseback.
McConnell hastily told Wheat there
was a robber down the road waiting for
* them. He then told Everson to get out
-and get behind a tree, as his presence
In the coach Avith a disposition to fight
' 'might cause the robber to lire on his

McConnell first met Black Bart dur

one mile from Elkhorn station, j He had
only one passenger, a man named
Brandt Greely, but there was $7000 in

the treasure box, tax money going to
San Andreas. When held up, the driver
threw out a strong box Avhich contained
nothing but Avay bills, and on being re
leased took the stage through. an hour
and a half ahead of time, Avith noth
ing missing but some letters and way
bills, the latter being easily dupli
cated.
At Funk Hill, four miles out from
Copperopolis, McConnell and Black
Bart had their most interesting adven
ture. At Reynolds Ferry there was a
family named Rogallra, with which the
driver had become quite friendly. The
boy was a good shot, and every few
trips had a nice quarter of venison
saved for McConnell. The driver re
ported to the boy about November 2,
1883, on the up trip that -he had seen
three nice deer, and on being informed
by the youngster that he was out of
ammunition took him a box of car
tridges the next trip. The boy got on
the stage, and about a quarter of a
mile from the scene where the adven
ture took place, got off to hunt awhile.
Intending then to return home.
The driver went on. and as the horses
nearod a clump of trees their ears
moved uneasily. McConnell sized up
the situatljn and saw some one mov
ing in the brush. The fellow had
flour sacks on his feet, another dropped
down over his head with eye holes pro
vided, and over this an old slouch hat.
The robber came boldly out now, but
'stepped sideAvlse across the road, evi
dently being on the* lookout for some
one he supposed AA'as behind .the stage.
"What are you looking for?" asked
McConnell.
"I want to know where that man Is
that was on the seat with you , a few
minutes ago," returned the man in the
flout sacks.
"Oh, he was only a boy looking for
his cows. He has. gone home," re
turned the driver. ' . . .
"Well, then, get down and unhitch
your team," commanded the robber,
still looking suspiciously . down the
road. A. - . ....
After some work the team was got
out . and, Bart Avent. to the brush and
got his tools. He pointed , the gun at
McConneU and ordered him to hurry
up. The driver, thinking the robber in
tended follow up the strong. box. got
the team around a' turn in the* road.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, jfejSTDAy-, . FEBRUARY 19, 1899.
Looking across country he saw the boy
with the gun. Black Bart was at work
on the box now and Avas hammering
away with a great deal of noise. It
must have attracted the attention of
the boy, as he glanced back and re
sponded to the driver's signal to return.
Securing the gun, McConnell told the
boy to follow. He crept along through
the brush and saw Bart leisurely leav
ing the scene with his gun under one
arm and a sackful of treasure under the
other.' The driver got a bead on the
fellow and . then fired. Bart glanced
hastily around and made two or three
big jumps forward. By the time a sec
ond shot was ready the robber Avas
tacking his course toward a clump of
brush. , It was afterward found that
the first shot had cut the lapels of
Bart's, two coats and taken off a vest
button. Bart then ran and got out of
range of the fighting driver. The boy,
hoAV ever,/ exclaimed that he couid get
his range, and, taking the gun, fired
a shot. . The pursuers got within sixty
yards of Bart before he was lost in th;
brush.- As? the robber ran the driver
saw him drop something, which after
ward proved to be a handkerchief. Mc-
Connell picked it up and also the rob
ber's tools; which, Avith the broken
treasure boxes, were taken on to Cop
peropolis as fast as the team could pull
the stage. â¢' :
McConnell reported the affair first to
Sheriff Thorn of Calaveras County and
then to*' J. lÃ. Hume. Orrin Langmaid
and Thacker with Tom Cunningham's
bloodhounds arrived at 2 o'clock Sun
day ..-, morning. When * Thacker . found
the laundry marks on the handkerchief
he remarked to McConnell: .. . ,vr ;
"That will land his boat."
On July 29 of that year Dorsey and
Shinn ; stopped McConnell at Funk Hill.
They got an empty box and a few dol
lars from -a' passenger. McConnell got
so used to getting robbed, or. rather be
ing stopped that he ceased to make
anything .but a mental -. note of . = it.

United States Marshal, was the . driver.

the brake, thinking him a tramp.
The robber's gun went off and the team
started. Shine 1 urged 'them forward
and got away with the treasure. The
robbers in the brush shot the bow off
immediately behind him. John was on
the go, however, and hit only the high
places on the run .to Columbia. This
was before ; daybreak. He , has had
many other adventures and carries a
Wells-Fargo watch.
A coin recently discovered in Paris, the
property of a well known numismatist, M.
Boyer d'Agen, has attracted much atten
tion, as it is believed that it is of the Mes
sianic period, and worn by Jewish Chris
tians in Jerusalem during the first cen
tury after Christ. On one side of the coin
there is a portrait of the Savior, with the
name of Jesus in Hebrew letters; on the
reverse this motto: "The Messiah, v the
King, will come in peace. He is the in
carnate living light of men."
Later research shows that there is al
most an exact duplicate of this coin in
an English collection. 'This coin has a
curious history. It was unearthed in 1812
in County Cork, Ireland, by a girl while
digging j for potatoes. â¢ The piece is of
bronze. On one side is the head of Christ;
on the other, in Hebrew: "The Messiah
has reigned. He came in peace, and being
made the light of man, he lives."
Numismatists agree that this coin must
be of great antiquity, because there is no
nimbus around the head, the aureole hav

some cheap and sure means of protecting

Many are the schemes deA'ised and the

the result that the winter visitor finds
many of the old groves robbed of their
picturesque beauty, some of them with
piles of llghtwood knots. stacked between
the rows of trees, ready to be lighted
whenever the mercury gets dangerously
close to the freezing point, while many
younger groves are almost â¢ hidden from

there is A'egetable life below.
These, however, are only the -more
simple meaÂ§s of protection, for, as one
drives through the country, he will see
many more elaborate methods in use. In
some groves are row after row of sheet

Avere spent on a farm near Mans
field, Conn. That the farm exer-
I cised any particular influence on
me I am unaware, unless it was
to breed a distinct resolve not to be a
farmer. From the time I began to read
and think of the future I wanted to be
a journalist or a lawyer, to achieve the
right to have my name mentioned
among public characters. My parents
removed to Albany, N. V., in 1849, and
soon afterward the first indications of
my decided bent came. \
I had not been at the Albany Acad
emy long before I started my first
newspaper, the Academy Record, one
copy to the edition, all written out ,by
hand, but made up as far as possible
like the printed newspapers of the day.
By this time I had decided that journal
ism Avas my goal; the law was no long
er in question. When I tried to find out
what I should do to fit myself specially
for J the career I had selected,., I groped
in the dark. Journalism was not a pro
fession; nor had the intimate relations
of to-day been at that -time established
between journalism and. statesmanship.
I -felt sure, however, that Horace Gree
ley was a model for any boy. I knew
; he must be a ; scholar as well as a
sneaker- a. statesman aa wall Â«Â» a. writ-
er. There was certainly no time to lose
if I set myself such an Imposing task.
The politics of Albany, the capital
city of the Empire State, is always in
teresting. I learned all I could about
it ' while I was at the t academy. The
presidential campaign of 1852, when the
famous old Whig party of Webster and
Clay went to pieces, found me with
rather more than the boy's ordinary
interest in : national affairs. I began
reading the history of my own country,
which to this day I find the most fasci
nating as well as fruitful of studies. ?
Fervid Politician at .14.
The excitement of the Fremont cam
paign in '56 appealed to me as stronely
as to most of the electors. A boy of 14.
with? my studies to look after. I attend
ed all .the meetings, j listened easrerly to
the speaking,, took part in the parades.
The Republican organization i formed jto
support Fremont was full of the vital
ity of , youth, fervid with the â¢ solemnity
of conviction.- It â  voiced the ; growing
anti-slavery . sentiment which . was
strong in the country. The feeling of
national unrest, the, presentiment lof
national disaster, Inflamed the imagin
ation even of the schoolboy. 'The party,
which 'seemed to be founded, on right
eousness and justice, which had sprung
from the ruins of the once grand old
Whig party and now appealed to . the
conscience of the country, was the po
litical organization with which' I de
sired above all things to be connected.
Its orators became my instructors, its
principles as announced on the stump
were so many new. text books. Politics
was a part of my education.
Beginning Newspaper Work.
â . âSo 4 it came about that when I had
finished my academy course I was able
to offer to the Albany Transcript, edit
ed by one of my former teachers, edit
orials which the editor liked well
enough to warrant his engaging me to
go on writing them. The conditions of
journalism were so different then and
now that It is hardly necessary for me
to say my engagement on the Tran
script did not establish a precedent.
Few outsiders get into the sanctum
nowadays." The newspaper business
has broadened out on the lines of other
successful business organizations and
the beginner must start at the bottom
as a rule. '.-_,-_
I had a year of this work, which was
also a year of the study and practice of
politics, and then I went to Union Col-
lege at ; Schenectady. The war . fever
was already in the air. I went into the
Presidential campaign ?â  of 1860, --. and
stumped the counties adjacent to the
college, ' and acquired a marked taste
for political speaking, a taste unmarred
by the . stage fright of *â¢ most untried
orators. -Yet in the more recent years
I have experienced time and time again
a feeling of apprehension or hesitation
Avhen rising to speak on some theme of
grave? import: That this- feeling was
not. experienced in 1860 it seems to me
must ; ha\'e been due to the deep per
sonal interest I took in the canvass. In
all the neighboring parades and,pro
cessions ? of that. eA-entful time, when
the Wide Awakes began to cut a figure
in the public eye,* the college campaign
club; : of : which * I was captain, took an
active part. ? ..... ; . "Ay
While I was. active as aid to General
Rathbone in raising and organizing vol
unteer regiments, the next. three or four
years of my life were also deA'oted' to
â¢">â¢â 'â¢'
political study, organization and ac
tivity. By 1864 I had become familiar
with open air campaign speaking. My
leisure \ time I employed in the study
of general history, American history
and economics, wfth a continuation of
activity in; writing, Avhich resulted in
1865, when I was 23, In my becoming
editor of the Albany Express, in which
I soon acquired an interest. The Trans

Public Men Cannot Be Convivial.
. The years immediately following the
conclusion of the war between the
States were now developing those in
teresting changes in American public
and public men which have become
fairly characteristic, it seems to me. of
the last half of our century. The Amer
ican statesman is no longer a senti
mentalist. Economic questions have
gradually become the â  most Important.
With the decline of sentiment in states
manship, sentimental oratory has also
become largely a thing of the past. Our
national life has become serious and
practical. Great problems of organiza
tion have gradually occupied the fore
most minds. Economic questions nat
urally do not need to.be exploited by
the flights of oratory. While the power
to make an effective speech still re
mains a desirable accomplishment for
there are occasions and topics that can
in no other way be so impressed on an
audience as by eloquence, speechmak
ing has become a minor part of the
equipment of a successful public man.
The interests after which the average
Representative in Congress now has to
look have become so diverse, so compli
cated, so important that he has all he
can do to attend to fhem. The demands
on his time are so great that he finds
leisure for little, if any, of that social
if convivial life which in ante-bellum
days was so characteristic of public
men in Washington. Conviviality and
a high order of public usefulness are no
longer compatible.
"Concentration and Constancy."
Whatever success I have met with is
due primarily to concentration and con
stancy. I felt that I could not afford
to give up journalism for officeholding,
so I declined in Albany to take the
nomination for Congress, or for any of
fice. While continuing my neAvspaper
work, I endeavored each year to make
a substantial addition to my equipment.
American biography I found stimulat
ing as -well as instructive. In fiction,
"Vanity Fair,"/ "David Copperfield"
and the "Three Musketeers'' delighted
me. I haA-e always . been fond of the
theater, but I found little time to go.
Fortunately, I haA-e found . my chief
pleasure In my work.
Greeley, Raymond and the elder Ben
nett, were the powerful personalities in
American journalism AA'hen I was groAv
ing up. People read Greeley's newspa
per, for example, to find out what Gree
ley thought. But one interesting devel
opment of our time has been the prac
tical annihilation of this personal ele
ment In journalism. There is no one
newspaper that so far excels the others
as to OA'ershadow their influence in
their own fields. Journalism is so much
broader and more. exacting that it re
quires many personalities Instead of
one to produce and maintain the news
paper. At the same time the contribu
tions of journalism to. statesmanship in
the "United States haA-e notably In
creased In the generation past. Law
remains, of course, the school of pub
lic men. Yet in no other country save â¢
France haA-e so many public men left
the editorial sanctum for the halls
of legislation.- Representative Nelson
Dingley, whose recent death was a loss
to his party and his country, never
abandoned entirely, I believe, his life
work on the ?Lewiston Journal, which
began in 1856. Mr. Blame, the greatest
of America's editorial statesmen, was -
Identified with the Kennebec Journal.
Senator Anthony with the Providence
Journal, Hon. Whitelaw Reid and Hon*..

Journalism and Public Life.
In England Junius and later John
Wilkes demonstrated the force of jour
nalism in public life. Delane held no of
fice, but preferred to be the power be
hind the placeholder. William Henry
Smith, the head of the great News com
pany, was for years the leader of the
House of Commons. Labouchere Is a
conspicuous example of the journalist
statesman of to-day. In France the
names of Gambetta, Thiers and Cavail
lac naturally suggest themselves.
While editing the Albany Express I
was introduced to Horace Greeley. It
was soon after he had gone on Jefferson
Davis' bail -bond and had provoked
from over the country a fire of criti
cism which had drawn out his charac
terization of country editors as "those
insignificant . fellows , that God in his in
scrutable ; wisdom . permits to edit the
country papers." -f .. A".yjA,'
A Greeley Anecdote.
Mr. Greeley came to Albany and Gov
ernor Fenton presented me to him, at a
reception in the executive mansion, as
the editor of the Express. "Yes, Mr.
Greeley," I said, as I grasped his hand,
"I am ? one of. those insignificant fel
lows that God in his inscrutable wis
dom permits to edit the country news
papers." He laughed heartily and we
became good 1 friends. Not long after
ward . I went to New York ?on- a â¢ confi
dential mission from Governor Fenton,
and ? saw Mr. Greeley -at that historic
desk of his in the Tribune office," writing
away with his hand up under his chin
as he followed his pen with his eyes.
As to the turning point in my. career?
I was taking a grave risk when, in 1880,
I translated myself from New York
State to Pennsylvania. In 1870 I had
become joint and in 1877 sole editor of
the Albany Evening Journal. I was at
home in New York public life, and had
been asked in : . State conventions time .
after time to frame the resolutions em
bodying the platform of. the party. I
had been secretary -of the platform
committee of i the national Republican
convention of 1876 and had come to an
ticipate only one possible removal from
Albany, that to New York. When I ac
cepted the editorship of the Philadel
phia Press, the leading Republican
journal of a famous old Republican
commonwealth, I found myself face to
face with life under new conditions, not
in a new. State, 'but in a long-estab
lished civilization. But I accepted the
risk and have not regretted it.

After Mr. Keely's death the laboratory
was given up and all the apparatus,
wires, tubing, etc., in fact, everything
which could be used as a clew to the
discovery of the principles underlying
the alleged motor, but It is shOAvn by
the result that Keely had not taken
any one Into his confidence, and this
accounts for even his supporters being
ignorant of the existence of the re
markable things which came to light.
Every bit of flooring was ripped up
and every nook and cranny explored in
the floors, walls and ceilings, and it
was found that the building Avas honey
combed with traps, holes for piping,
etc., for carrying on the bogus experi

such secrecy and ceremony, and the

Three-Ton Sphere Compressed &\r Reservoir Discovered Under the Building.
"Back of this was a room in which no one was ever admitted, and. here a remarkable discovery was made. A
steel sphere forty inches in diameter, weighing 6625 pounds, was found embedded in a pit underneath a trap. The
sphere had two projections or trunnions; both had a hole through them; one of these had been filled up and then
faced off, and the other was open and was of the proper size for charging the reservoir. Midway between the two
trunnions a small hole drilled Into the side of the sphere was found to be the proper size for connecting with one
of the small brass tubes connecting with the second story. These tubes, while of small diameter, and having a small
bore, have very thick walls, showing that they could resist enormous pressure. Of course, the sphere possessed great
strength, and must have been an ideal storage reservoir for air or gas at a great pressure.

Back of this was a room to which no
one was ever admitted, and here a re
markable disebvery was made. A steel
sphere forty inches in diameter, Aveigh
ing 6625 pounds, was found embedded
in a pit underneath a trap. The sphere
had two projections or trunnions; both
had a hole through them; one of
these holes had been filled up and
then faced off, and the other was
open and was of the proper
size for charging the reservoir.
Midway betAveen the two trunnions a
small hole drilled into the side of the
sphere was found to be the proper size
for connecting with j one of the small
brass tubes connecting with the -second
story. These tubes, while of small di
ameter and having a small bore, haA-e
very thick walls, showing that they
could resist enormous pressure.
Of course, the sphere possessed great
strength and must haA'e been an ideal
storage reservoir for air or gas ,at i a
great pressure. William Rickert, who
Avas formerly .employed in Keely's
laboratory, has come forward with val
uable evidence. He says he helped to
test the steel sphere with a hydraulic
pump which was specially made for the
purpose. . It was tested up to 28,000
pounds, or only one ton less than the
powder chamber pressure required in
tests of United States ordnance. _ Steel
tubes were also tested with this power
ful hydraulic pump. The- tubes were
nine inches in diameter and ? the bore
was only three inches. These were split
with enormous pressure and the stock
holders and the general public believed
that the tubes were burst by the "eth
eric vapor." - * v.:'
Mr. Rickert states that they ran
tubes to the lever machine which Indi
cated pressure, and one of the tubes
recently discovered Mr. Rickert believes
to be a tube running to that machine.
He also states that Keely never allowed
the men to entirely complete any con
nection to the machinery; he assumed
that part of the business himself.
The investigators have concluded that
this monster steel sphere was the whole
secret of Keely's mystifying experi
ments. They claim that he used com
pressed air, to move his experimental,
machinery. This Avas under enormous
pressure and conducted to any desired
spot through small" pipes that had the
outward appearance of wire.
' There was a great similarity in the
frequent exhibitions which Mr. Keely
gave of his motor, . and the various
phenomena he claimed to produce by:
means of his triune polar current. By.
special invitation, the spectators would â¢
meet at" the Twentieth-street' labora- ,
tory on a day set by the, inventor. If?
the guests were of special importance
there would sometimes be an introduc
tory exhibition, say the day previous, :
at which the dismantled machines
would be shown and the functions of
the different parts explained. By the
next day Mr. Keely would have the
parts together again, "graduated." or
"sensitized," and his motor ready for
operation.7 \yi y\ . ., '.fy_- A; f yl AAy"** .
The motor plant consisted, as Mr.
Keely explained it, of: 1. The trans
mitter. 2. The motor, or engine. These |
were connected by a transmitting wire. I
The transmitter, was' a: hollow brass
sphere or ball, resting on a heavy brass
base. 'In the last transmitter this ball
had been reduced to about the size of
an orange. In the older transmitters
it was some ten inches in diameter.
Around the base of the transmitter
projected, horizontally, a circle of steel
rods, Avhich vibrated and sounded like
a tuning fork Avhen twanged by the
fingers. This was the dominant scale
of the instrument. The interior of the,
globe contained two or more Chladni
plates and a group of brass resonating
tubes, looking like a bunch of empty
brass gun cartridges. This collection
of brass tubes was called the shifting
resonator. From one side of the globe
projected a small ball or knob called
the graduating shift, which held the
head of a long screw which passed Into
the center of the globe and enabled the
operator to shift the resonating tubes
backward or forward.
This transmitter was the generator
or awakener of the * vibratory etherlc
force which ran the motor. It was an
acoustic device simply. By twanging
the proper rods in the dominant scale
at the base of the transmitter, the vari
ous resonating tubes, 'phones and
Chladni plates took up the vibrations,
carrying the note up the musical scale
with infinite rapidity, conserving, mul
tiplying and intensifying It, reducing
the wave lengths of the vibrations until
they became so rapid or fine as to be
synchronous with the vibratory im
pulses of the magnetic currents flowing
toward the north pole. Mr. Keely said
this stream was of a triple nature, the
result of sympathetic Interaction among
the planets of . our solar system, and
constituted an endless closed circuit.
This vibratory impulse was carried
from the transmitter by the wire to
the motor, where, acting on the polar
and depolar disks, It set tile motor In
motion, as will be explained later.
The motor Itself consisted of a heavy
Iron hoop, or band, firmly supported, on
a bed plate. Within this hoop and re
volving freely on a stationary axis,
supported by posts at each end, was a
double walled hub, or drum, from
which eight spokes projected toward
the hoop. On the end of each spoke
Avas a vitalized disk. On the outer side
of the hoop were nine series of resona
tors and an equal number of vitalized
disks on the inner side of the hoop. By
having one more disk on the hoop than
there were disks on the spokes, a dead
center was avoided. A pulley attacnea
to the revolving hub served as a means
to transmit the power by. a belt. â 
" The company having duly .assembled,
Mr. Keely would point out. in place,
the parts examined the day previous,
and before commencing the exhibition
Avould explain the working of his motor
someAvhat as follows:;" v.:
"In the conception of any machine
heretofore constructed, the medium for
Introducing a neutral center, has never
been found. If it had the difficulties
of perpetual motion seekers would have
ended and this problem would have
become an established operating fact.
It would only require an introductory
Impulse on such a device to cause it
to run for centuries. I did not seek to
gain perpetual motion; but a circuit is
formed that actually has a neutral cen
ter. Avhich is in a condition to be vivi
fied by my vibratory ether or polar
stream, and Avhile so fed is an inde
pendent motor,' as you will see.*
Thereupon Mr. Keely would step to
his transmitter, fiuger over the dom
inant scaleâ the " steel pins running
around the base of the transmitterâ
meanwhile turning the knob on the side
of the transmitter to get. the correct ad
justment of the resonator within, and
would soon strike the right note. Then
the harmonic rosonant Impulse, which
AA'as transmitted along the wire to the
motor from the transmitter, would
awaken in the sensitized disks of the
motor, with reference to the "outreach"
of the third or dominant current of the
polar stream, alternating conditions of
"sympathetic negative attraction" and
"sympathetic positive propulsion." As
a necessary consequence the spokes of
the motor Avould begin to, revolve with
in the rim of the machine and Mr.
Keely would expain that this motion
could be kept up until the machine
wore out a costless, Inexpensive power.
The miracle was accomplished before
the eyes of the distinguished guests.
The day before they had examined the
various parts of the engine: they had
seen the spherical transmitter aoart
and had admired the wonderful collec
tion of Chladni plates, resonators,
graduated adjustment screw and other
paraphernalia that came out of it and
looked at the wire, even clipped It and
been given a piece by Mr. Keely. It
was solid, usually of German silver,
about the size of a knitting needle.
After the motor was In motion they
were allowed to test for electricity or
magnetism; not a trace. Without a
doubt Mr. Keely had discovered a new
force.
So has thought many a stockholder
who now deserves the honest sym
pathy of the reader, for there will be
no Keely motor stock worth thousands
of dollars per, share. However, the
memory of the Keely Motor Company
is likely to outlast the present genera-

MADE A FORTUNE IN BIRDS' EGGS.
A sparrow's egg seems of little or no
value and yet there is a man ln Paris
who can transform it into a prize really
worth having. Indeed, this ingenious
gentleman makes a very handsome income
through his skill in coloring birds' eggs.
As to the legitimacy of his business tne
reader can judge for himself.
A few years ago this wideawake
Parisian was an assistant in a provincial
museum of. natural history, and while
there he learned and saw a great deal
which has since been of much use to him.
So much, Indeed, did he learn that when
he lost his position he went to Paris and
determined to start in business for him
self His apprenticeship at the museum
had shown him the value of birds' eggs,
and he promptly decided to make a living
by dealing in rare eggs. True, he had only
a very small collection of eggs with which
to start business, but this was a trifling
obstacle to a man of his versatile genius.
He knew that there were many collectors
in various countries who were willing to
pay fancy prices for eggs, and he resolved
to supply their demands, no matter how
extravagant they might be.
Of course, not having many rare eggs
and - lacking the necessary facilities for
procuring them he could not supply them
unless he manufactured them, and this he
did. For example, if a collector wrote to
him for a penguin's egg, he would make
out of gypsum a shell exactly resembling
that of a penguin's egg, and he would
but just above the ground floor of the
room, another Iron shaft came through
the wall, also with a pulley on it. A
small well-worn belt was found, which
fitted over and exactly connected these
two pulleys. Going into the small rear
room, mostly filled with old junk and
the door of which was raised consider
ably above that of the middle room,
there was discovered beneath a box
and an oilcloth spread out on the floor
a trap door. This trap opened over the
shaft; which came through the wall.
Here it was found that the shaft con
nected with a small water motor of
peculiar construction, the water being
supplied by a lead pipe coming in from
the outside of the building. .Extend
ing from this water motor was a small
rubber tube. It was found that by at
taching a rubber bulb to this tube the
water motor could be started by press
ing the bulb and would stop when the
pressure was released. This water
motor is now in the laboratory of Mr.
Kinraide, in Boston. The rubber tub
ing was found also to extend between
the walls and ceiling from the water
motor to a point under the Keely mo
tor, then up through the stationary
post of the engine and to terminate in
the binding post or socket into which
the end of the wire was inserted which
connected the motor with the trans
mitter. Further investigation revealed
the fact that there were in the labora
tory different sets of transmitting wire,
exactly alike in external appearance,
but one was hollow, the other solid,
both, as mentioned, about the size of a
knitting needle, and with connecting
tips that made it impossible to tell
which was hollow and which was solid,
except by cutting or trying to blow
through them.
"A duplicate, an exact copy in exter
nal appearance, was found of the
latest perfected transmitter, 'the grad
ual perfection of years of patient study
and improvement.' The duplicate
transmitter exactly resembled its mate,
but upon opening it the Chladni plates
and the resonators were lacking. In
stead was a rubber diaphragm
stretched across' the. sphere,' dividing it
vertically into two air-tight compart
ments. The long screw, with its head
in the little bulb on the side of the
sphere, and which in the exhibition
transmitter regulated the position ol
the resonator, in the duplicate trans
mitter worked in a fine thread through
a small brass plate clamped in the cen
ter of the diaphragm. By turning the
knob the diaphragm could be thrown
backward or forAvard. By connecting
the motor and the real transmitter by
means of the hollow wire, then turning
the knob in the proper direction, the
diaphragm would be thrown forward,
the air forced through the wire "and.
down through its various connections
to the water motor, releasing an auto
matic cut-off and setting the water
motor in motion.
"A more careful Investigation of thÂ«
Keely motor showed that the station
ary axis Avas hollow. Within this hol
low shaft, which was only a dummy,
the real axle revolved, over one end oi
Avhich passed the belt which ran down
through the hollow post to the pulley
underneath on the end of the iron shaft
described. This inner axle, run by the
belt, carried the hub of the motor and
caused the same to reA'olve when It re
volved."
forward it to his customer, who would
never dream that a penguin had not laid
it. As a rule, howeA-er, he uses a shell of
some common egg, his sole care being to
see that it corresponds in size with the
desired egg. The eggs of the common fly
catcher are very cheap, and by coloring
them properly they can be made to re
semble much costlier eggs. Again, a
duck's egg costs very little, and yet ur
ingenious French gentleman could easily
transform it into an egg worth from 40
to 60 francs. Pigeons' eggs are also very
useful for a similar purpose, since they
are exactly the same size as many very
rare eggs. Any one with a knowledge of
chemistry could change them so that the
pigeons themselves would not recognize
them. ..*;.; Â. ,
Almost every collector of birds' eggs
desires to have one or two finely marked
nightingale's eggs, and is willing to pay
a high price for them. The Parisian
dealer was well aware of this little weak
ness, and, larks being more abundant
than nightingales, he found no difficulty
in getting larks' eggs "and coloring them
so that they were exactly like the genu
ine article as deposited in remote places
by the timorous nightingale.
It can be seen that this Is a very profit
able/business and a little consideration
will show that there is not much risk of
detection. True, the tricky methods of
th!s Parisian dealer have been brought
to light, but the discovery was apparently
made more by chance than by any sus
picion on the part of his customers that
they were being swindled out of their
money.
The average collector, no matter wheth
er he has a passion for autographs, pos
tage stamps, coins or birds' eggs, is in
clined to be gullible, and this seems to be
especially the case with . collectors of
eggs. They know that certain birds lay
eggs of a certain size and color, and if
they can get eggs that seem to be fault
less in these respects they are satisfied.
The thought that the coloring may not
always be natural does not seem to enter
their heads. At any rate, such has been
the experience of this Parisian dealer. He
has forwarded specimens of his skill to
collectors in all countries and it does not
appear that he was a fraud. Hereafter
collectors will probably be more cautious
about buying eggs, especially from for
eign dealers. â  . .

I It's. a rough road to the volcano. It's
a dodging among coal cars and a passing

narrow railroad track which crawls
around., the hillside. It is a region of red
banks pf earth and disintegrating rock.
* Below' "Is a raA-lne through which runs a
brook with the washing of coal dust
along its slippery banks. A bit of the

' the top âof an overhanging bank. There

are depressions which show that earth

Around the curve of the undulating
Itramcar track is the pumping station,
where by means of a siphon the water is
drawn off from a pond into the brook
below. ! On the right is a sheer wall of red
shale.' : There is a winding path which
leads"- to the top of the hill.
The winter has placed a heavy hand
upon vegetation, but It does not take more
__. - a: glance to know that the trees on
iftift ill are dead. They have the appear
ance of 'the petrified trees In some un
derground forest. There are branches
which haA-e fallen at the base of the
shriveled trees.
Along the top of" the hill the steam
bursts from a score of openings. We are
standing over a rift in the earth from
which it puffs in our faces. Around the
aperture the ground is moist and warm,
and a sulphurous odor rises. Here - the
moss takes on a deeper green. It Is the
only vegetation which seems to flourish
in the Gulf Stream-like temperature.
There is a A-iA'idness in its hue which sug

It seems as though the pressure of the
steam below A'arles. The stokers must be
slow at times, for the steam comes in
puffs; then issues in a steady stream,
as though a group of locomotlA-es far be
neath were blowing off steam.
You notice as you go toward that strag
gling bit of track that there is a percepti
ble warmth beneath your feet. In -front of
you several Inches of earth fall into
a seam. Beneath the railroad tracks ap
pears a red streak. We are standing over
a chophouse grill on the top of a Penn
sylvania mountain. The hot air rises and
the breath of a sirocco hangs over the
place. The sun Is shining brightly, and
in the light the rays of heat are plainly
A-islble as they rise in quivering, break
ing lines. It is not safe to wander in this
neighborhood. Under other conditions
there would be a genial and comforting
glow about the fire which sends its rays
into our faces. There are no patches of
snow to giA-e a cooling aspect to the
landscape here. The air along the edere
of the cliff is hot and dry and harsh. The
narrow track will be obliterated one of
these days apd the ties will go up In
smoke.
There is a fascination about that glow
ing grate on the mountain top. Almost
before I realize it I take from my pocket .
a cigar and stoop over the red seam, sup
porting myself by holding to a railroad
tie. A hot blast of air strikes my face.
It Is a longer reach to the glowing coals
than I thought. The heat almost blisters
the outstretched hand. It is only half
an inch more. The end of the Havana
strikes the bed of coals.
Behind me the earth gives away. One
foot almost slips toward the red coals.
The earth falls and covers the furnace
glare. Did ever a spadeful of earth more
opportunely, fall? -The cold perspiration
is standing on my forehead as I scramble
away from the grill set. The cigar is
lighted. We hurry away from the spot.

up timbers. From the rock above us
icicles hangâ stalactites formed by the
cold winds which sweep In at the open

upon them, giving the effect of a dimly
lighted subterranean gallery such as are

Handkerchiefs That Have Cut a Figure in Crime.

the civilized world spellbound with

kerchief. :â¢/:â¢? â¢
"Apparel oft proclaims the man," and
there are about a handkerchief certain
Indications that can trace ft to its owner
or rather vice versa, by the perfumery or
sachet upon it in some instances: by its
size, whether it be a man's or a woman's;
by initials in the corner; by its quality,
and by the laundry marks upon It. as in
the case of the notorious desperado and
stage robber so well remembered Call
fornlansâ"Black Bart."
One of the cleverest pieces of detective
work ever accomplished In this State was
done In this case by J. B. Hume, special
officer for Wells-Fargo. .
When news reached his office on No
vember 3, 1883, that a stage had beert
held up and robbed near Tuttlevllle id
that a handkerchief and some other arti
cles had been found behind some chits
near the place of attack, Mr. Hume im
mediately telegraphed to have the things
sent down to him. .
He carefully Inspected the handkerchief
âa plain hemstitched man's handkerchief
-and noticed a laundry. mark in one cor
ner F x 0 7. Upon this evidence, a hand
kerchief with that fatal laundry mark,
was Black Bart arrested.
Mr. Hume set to work to flnd out where
the handkerchief had been laundered, and
after several. days of careful Inquiry and
diligent search it was traced to a laundry
down on Bush street, kept by a man
named Ware. This laundry office was
also a sort of lounging room, with a to
bacco stand on one side, and here Black
Bartâ known there as j Charlie Bolton, a
mining man and capitalistâ a great
deal of his time. .
When the handkerchief was brought to
Ware and he was asked to whom it be
longed he said: "Why, that is Charlie
Bolton's handkerchief. He brought his
laundry here just before he returned to
the mines a short time ago."
That settled it. Detective Hume sent
instructions for the arrest of Black Bart.
Black Bart, who after years of depreda
tions, during which time he had robbed
twenty-eight stages and had kept the
stage drivers In continual, fear of - their
lives, this clever felon was at last trapped
by* a handkerchief. . The shrewd criminal,
who had held the Sheriff as well as the
Wells-Fargo detectives at 'bay for so long,
did not see that there was enough differ
ence between one handkerchief and an
other to disclose a man's identity and con
vict him of crime. But then Black Bart
lived before the days of Cordelia -Botkin.
On a handkerchief Shakespeare found

used with which to gag the victims, and
many of these handkerchiefs, are ln the
possession of pioneers, who relate to their
grandchildren tales of the wild and woolly
bygone days.
Two handkerchiefs figured in the Dur

Minnie Williams, was found covered with
blood behind the Emmanuel Church,
where the murders were perpetrated: .
Only last month Mrs. Slinkey commit
ted suicide with the aid of a handker
chief. She hung a trunk strap to four
nails and, in order to keep the strap from
slipping, she - twisted ? her r handkerchief
tightly around the -nails. Thus a hand

death; the 1 strap otherwise might have

She handles the baggage trucks and the

through the car windows is to give an
intelligent idea of her remarkable per
sonality. She is one of the most notable
of the several startling combinations of
female sex and male occupation which
this topsy-turvy end of the century has
produced.- Â«
Miss Young is a California girl. She was
educated in Los Angeles, ".and for a while
was a teacher In that county. y She at
tended business college later and learned
telegraphy and typewriting. Teaching did
not satisfy the vigorous spirit of the
girl nor give her sufficient opportunity
for the physical exercise and outdoor life
to which a long. residence on a Southern
California ranch had early accustomed
her. She was strong and athletic and
full of an adventurous Impulse to which
her extravagant healthiness constantly
urged her. ' She sought and obtained the
position of telegraph operator at Blake.
Still, her - restless desire for -, : active
physical employment kept her flitting
about on her feet away from the clicking
keys as ' much >as possible . _ and en
gaging in duties about the station which
did not ' belong , to her. She learned the
signals used in greeting the trains as they
came rushing in from either direction on
the regular continental line as '.well as on
the " little branch line which ran from
Blake to Manvel. This little branch line,
by the way, is, probably the oddest rail
road in the country. It is a complete and
independent system by itself, > owned and
controlled by a company which owns
no other road. It is only thirty miles long
and in that thirty miles it rises 4875 feet,
such being the altitude of the mountain
town of ManA'el, situated among what are
known as the New York Mountains..
Seven years ago this thirty miles of rail
was laid, and to-day the line is paying
handsomely. It is called the California
Eastern, because some of the sharehold
ers are Californians and some Easterners.
A Denver man is president, a New York
man (R. S. Slebert) is general manager.
The latter's headquarters are at Manvel.
Another uncommon feature of this min
iature railway is that its one train adapts
itself obligingly to the wishes of Its pas
sengers in the matter of the time at which
It shall leave a station. The writer was
told, when he got off the Santa Fe train
at Blake one night at 9 o'clock, that- he
could depart thence for Manvel on the
following morning at 8:30, such being the
time scheduled for the little Independent
train to start on Its 4875-foot climbâ a per
formance which it undertakes three times
a week.
The traA'eler overslept next morning and
got down to the station an hour late. In
answer to his breathless Inquiries as to
the possibility of overtaking the train, he
was informed by the "Queen of the Des
ert," as Miss Young is called, that his
intention to go on the Manvel train had
been learned the night before and the
train was still waiting for him.
He found a funny mite of an engine and
three cars standing sedately behind thÂ« .
depot, with a faint haze of steam lazily
curling from the smokestack. Two of the
cars were loaded with freight in shape of
coal and grain, while the third, a passen
ger coach, was half filled with a litter of
boxes and sacks and scraps of railroad
iron lying in the aisle.
The speed at which we finally started
on our way left no doubt in * the lone :

TO CAPTURE AN METRESS BY CUTCUFFEMYNE.
Copyright. 1899, by Cutliffe Hyne. ,- .
THE! Parakeet had discharged the last of her coal into the lighters
alongside, had cast off from the mooring buoys and was steaming
out of the baking heat of Sue:-; harbor on her way down toward
the worse heat of the Red Sea beyond. . -
' A passenger, a young man of eight or, nine and twenty, lounged
on a campstool under the upper bridge awning and watched the
Parakeet's captain as he walked briskly across and across, and
presently when the little sailor faced him he nodded as though he had de
cided something that was in his thoughts.
"Well, sir?" said Captain Kettle. 1 â 
"I wish you wouldn't look so anxious. We've started now, and may as
well make up our minds to go through it comfortably."
"Quite so,'! said Kettle. "I'm thinking out how we are to do this busi
ness in comfort and safety." and with that he resumed his walk.
The man beside him had introduced himself when the black workers
were carrying the Parakeet's cargo of coal in baskets from the holds to
the lighters alongside, and Kettle had been rather startled to find that he
carried a letter of introduction from the steamboat's owners. The letter
gave him no choice of procedure. . It stated with clearness that Hugh
Wenlock, solicitor, had laid his wishes before them, and that they had
agreed to further these wishes (through the agency of their servant, Cap
tain Owen Kettle) in consideration of the payment of Â£200 sterling.
The Parakeet was a cargo tramp, and carried no passenger certificate,
but a letter of recommendation like this was equivalent to a direct order,
and Kettle sighed Mr.* Wenlock on to his crew list as "doctor," and put to
sea with an anxious mind.
Wenlock waited a while, watching squalid Suet sink into the sea be
hind, and then he spoke again.
"Look here, captain," he said, "those South Arabian ports have got a
lot worse reputation than they really deserve. The people down there
twenty years ago were a pack of pirates, I'll grant you, but nowadays
they've got the fear of the gunboat always handy, and that's a wonderful
clA'ilizing power. I tell you, captain, you needn't be frightened; that pirate
business is exploded for now and always."
"I know all about the piratical hankerings of those South Arabian nig
gers, sir," said Kettle, stiffly, "and I know what they can do and what they
can't do as well as any man living. And I know also what I can do myself
at a push, and the knowledge leaves me pretty comfortable. But, if you
choose to think me' frightened. I'll own that I am. It's the navigation
down there that gave me cold shivers the first moment you mentioned it."
"Why, it's no worse than the Red Sea here/anyway."
"The Red Sea's bad, but you can get good charts of It and rely on
them. South Arabian coast is no better, and the charts aren't worth the
paper they're printed on."
"I wouldn't like you to wreck the steamer down there. It might be
awkward for me getting back."
"Quite so," said Kettle. "You're thinking of yourself, and I don't
blame you. I'm thinking of myself also. I'm a man that's met with a
great deal of misfortune, sir, and from one thing and another I've beef
eight years without a regular command. I had the luck to bring in a dere
lict the other day and pocket a good salvage out of her, and my present
owners heard of it, and they put me as master of this steamer, just be
cause of that luck. I am not anxious to pile up this steamboat on some
uncharted reef."
"I'm as keen as you are not to get the steamer wrecked, and if there's
any way she can be kept out of a dangerous area, and you can manage to
pet me ashore where I want in a boat, just you say, and I'll meet you all
I can. But at the same time, skipper, if you don't mind doing a swap you
might give me a good deal of help over my matter in return."
"I haven't heard your business, yet. sir. All you've told he is that you
want to be set down in this place, Dunkhot, and be taken off again after
you've stayed there four and twenty hours."
"Well, you see I didn't want it talked over beforehand. If the news
papers got hold of the yarn and made a lot of fuss about it they might
upset a certain marriage that I've very much set my heart upon."
Captain Kittle looked puzzled. "I don't seem to quite follow you, sir."
"You shall hear the tale from the beginning. We haA-e plenty of time
ahead of us now. You remember the wreck of the Rangoon?"
"She was coming home from East Indian ports, wasn't she, and got on
fire somewhere off Cape Guardafui? Only about ten of her people saved,
if I remember." â¢ â¢*,-' â¢ /ii > "AA'. -".'j-Ayy.:
"That's .about right," said Wenlock; "it's twenty-five years ago now.
Among others lost was a Colonel Anderson and his wife and their child,
Teresa, aged four, and what made their deaths all the more sad was thÂ«
fact that Anderson's elder brother died just a week before, and he would
have come home to find a peerage and large estate waiting for him.
"I can feel for that man," said Kettle.
' "I can feel most for the daughter," said Wenlock.
"How do you mean, sir?" - .
"Well Colonel Anderson's dead and his -wife's dead, but the daughter
isn't, or at any rate she was very, much alive twelve months ago.-.. that's
all The whole lot of them, with others, got into one of the Rangoon s ,
boats, and after frizzling about at sea till they were nearly starved, got (
chucked on that South Arabian coast, which you say is so rocky and dan
gerous, and were drowned. All, barring Teresa, that is. She was. pulled
out of 'the water by the local niggers and was brought up by them, and
I've absolutely certain information that not a year ago she was living ln
Dunkhot as quite a big personage in her way." ./ ,
"And she's 'my lady' now. if she only knew?"
"-Well, not that. The title doesn't descend in the female line. But
Colonel Anderson made a -will in her favor after she was born, and the
present Earl; who's got the estates, would haA'e to shell out If she turned
up again." . :;.-" -Vvi:-:- /"'â _. .__._._â -.
"My owners In their letter mentioned that you were a solicitor. Then
â¢ you are employed by his lordship, sir?" .
Mr. Wenlock laughed. "Not much," said he, "I'm on my own hook.
Why, hang It all, captain, you must see that no man of his own free will
would be idiot enough to resurrect a long-forgotten niece just to make
himself into a beggar." â¢ yv-- ./
"I don't see. why not, sir, if he got to know, she was alive. Some men
have consciences, and even a Lord, I suppose. Is a man."
"This present Earl has far too good a time of it to worry about run
ning a conscience. No. I bet he fights like a thief for the plunder, how
ever clear a case we have to show him. And as he's the man In possession
and has plenty, of ready cash for law expenses, the odds are he'll turn out
too big. to worry, at through all the courts, and we shall compromise. I'd
like that best myself. * Cash down has a desirable feel about it." /â¢ ; ? //
"It has, sir," said Kettle, with a reminiscent sigh. "But will the" other
relatives of the young lady, those that are employing you, I mean, agree
to that?": '-. ' * , -..â  â ' â
"Don't I tell you, captain, I'm on my own hook? There are no other
relativesâ at. least none that would take a ha'p'oth of interest in
Teresa's getting the estates. I've gone into the thing on sheer spec, and.
for what I can make out of it, and that, please the Lord, will be the whole
lump."
"But how? The young lady may give you something in her gratitude,
of course, but you can't expect it all."
"I do, though; and I tell you how I'm going to get It. I shall marry the
fair Teresa. Simple as tumbling off a house."
Kettle drew himself up stiffly and walked to the other end of the
bridge and began ostentatiously to look with a professional eye over his
- vessel. ' '
"I don't like the idea of those sort of marriages," said the little sailor
acidly.-- 5: â¢â¢=- ?v\i'--Â«
Wenlock shrugged his shoulders good humoredly. "Neither do I, and
if I were a rich man I wouldn't have dreamed of it. Just think of what
the girl probably is; she's* been with*, those niggers since she was quite a
kid. Of course you'll say. there's romance about the : thing. But then I
don't Care tuppence about romance, and, anyway, it's beastly uncomforta
ble to live with." ',:â 'â -.
"I was not looking at that point of view.
THE ' -SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1899.
"Let mÂ© tell you how I was fixed," said Wenlock with a burst of confi
dence "Tfi '*â  small . capital. So I qualified as a solicitor and put up a
doorpiaÂ«*i*Â«ind waited for a practice. It didn't come. When the news of
this -cirl Teresa came I tell you I just jumped at the chance. I don't want
to marry her, of course: there are ten other girls I'd rather have as a
wife; but there was no other way out of the difficulty, so I just swallowed
my squtamishness for good and always. See?" *
"It was Miss Teresa Anderson I was pitying." said Kettle, pointedly.
"Good Lord, man, why? Isn't it the finest thing in the world for her?"
"It might be fine to get away from where she is and land home to find
a nice property waiting. But I don't care to see a woman have a husband
forced on her. It would be nobler of you, Mr. Wenlock,- to let the young
lady get to England and look round her for a while and make herown
choice." r ' '" ' â¢ ..,. . : L
"I'm too hard up to be noble," said Wenlock dryly. "I've not come here
on philanthropy, and marrying that girl is part of my business. Besides,
hang it all, man, think of what she is, and think of what I am." â¢â¢ He
looked himself up and down with a half humorous smile. ..
"Still," said Kettle, doggedly, "I don't like the idea of It." .. â :
"Then let me give you an inducement. I said I was not down here on
ph?lanthrophy, and I don't suppose you are either. If you'll help this mar
riage on in the way I ask I'll give you Â£50." ' y , A _â  '/-//Â» : :
"There's no man living who could do more usefully with Â£50 if I saw
mv way to Angering it. I was wondering, sir, If I could earn It honorably.
You must give me time to think this out, and I'll try and give you* an
answer after tea," ,-â -. ,~ __ i â â  -"
Captain Kettle had not seen necessary to mention the fact to Mr. Wen
lock but while that young mon was talking of the Miss Teresa Anderson,
who at present was "quite a big personage In: her way," a memory haa
come to him that he had heard. of the lady betore in somewhat less prosaic
terms., All sailormen who have done business on the great sea highway
between the west and east during recent years have had the yarn given
to them at one time or another, and most of them have regarded it as a
gratuitous legend. Kettle was one of these. : But he was beginning to
think there was something more in it than a mere sailor's yarn, and he
was anxious to see if there was any variance in the telling. manr â .'..-. , k â¢
So he sent for Murray, his mate, made him sit, and commenced talk
of a ourelv professional nature. Finally he said: "And since I saw you
?Lt the^schedSle's Bchanged.8 changed. We call in at Dunkhot. for that Passenger.
Mr. Wenlock, to do some private business ashore before we go onto our
Pe Mu?ray 're^eat^' the name thoughtfully. "Dunkhot? Let's see, that's
on the South Persian coast, about a day's steam from Aden, and a beast
of a place to get at. so I've heard. Oh. and of course that's the place
where that she Sultan, or Queen, or whatever she calls herself, is boss.
"So there Is really a woman of that kind there, is there? I'd heard of
her like everybody else has, but I thought she was only a. yarn. . - j
"No, she's there in the flesh, sir, right enough; lots of flesh, according
"DÂ°\6o SAV A *fajj
to what I've gathered. A serang on one of the B. and I. boats, who'd been ..
in Dunkhot, told me about her only last year. She makes war, leads her,
troops, cuts off heads, and does the eastern potentate up to the mark;- The 1
serang said she was English, too, though! didn't believe much in that.
One-tenth English would probably be more near the truth. The odds are
she'll be Eurasian .and those snuff and butter colored ladies,. when they ,-i
get among people blacker than themselves, always try to ignore , their own |
lick of the tar brush. The cerang said she was a big buffalo -bull: of aY
woman, with a terror of a temper. I? don't know what's Mr. Wenlock's,.
business, sir, but he'd- better make, up his mind to square her first : and *
foremost." .
"Is she the head chief's favorite wife, then?" Â..- â â /â .'â¢- I ,*,
"That's the funny part of it; she isn't married. These Orientals always j

it seems they didn't, because sbe? said she'd, certainly poison -any man If*
they sent her into his zenana. Guess there wasn't any man about the place 1
white enough to suit her taste." . * * ,'â¢* :, â .-.,. ,:-â¢
Kettle went out then under the awnings of the bridge deck and told .-
Wenlock that he would probably, be able ; to earn his fee for helping on /
the marriage,' and Wenlock confidently thought that he quite understood
the situation. ? . ".:â¢".-â  -'..,*â¢ . - ?':
"Skipper's a bit of a Methody." thought- Hugh Wenlock, "but if he -
gets me snugly married to that little girl he'll be cheap at the price." _'-*;-
Dunkhot stood on an eminence, snugly walled, and filled. with ' cool,
square houses. At one side the high minaret of a mosque stood, up like J
a bayonet, and at the other, standing in' a ring of garden, was a 'larger/
building, which seemed to call Itself palace. J- The Parakeet lay to; rolling '
outside tho entrance, flying a pilot jack and waiting developments. ;Â«-.*Â»?&Â«&*Â§.
Captain Kettle might have his disquieting thoughts, still outwardly ho
was cool. But Hugh Wenlock was on deck ln the sprucest of his apparel,
and was A'islbly anxious and fidgety, as befitted a man who shortly expect
ed to enter Into the bonds of matrimony.' , , â¢'-/..â¢ ;*.;y-,
A double-ended boat came ; off presently,- manned . by naked Arabs, and '
steered by a man In white burnous. ; She swept up alongside, caught aif
rope and maaj fast, and the man in white introduced himself as a pilot. ;
The pilot spoke some English. He could guide them. through the reefs ,
in the most complete safety, he said, and he could guarantee fine openings '
for trade, once inside. '
"I dare say," grunted Kettle, under his breath, "but you're a heap too
uncertificated for my taste."
Then he turned to Murray. "Now, look here, Mr. Mate, I'll leave you
in charge. Don't let any of these niggers come on board on any pretense
whatever, and If they try it on steam out to sea. I'll get through , Mr.
Wenlock's business ashore as quick as I can, and perhaps pick up a ton
or two of cargo for ourselves." ?v'~*
Below the pilot clamored that a ladder might be thrown to him, so that
he might come on board and take the Parakeet forthwith into the anchor
age; and to him again Kettle turned and temporized. He must go ashore
himself first, he said, and see what offer there was of trade, before he took
the steamer. in. . To which the pilot, though visibly disappointed, saw flt
to asree. :
'.'Now, sir," said Kettle to Wenlock, "Into the boat with you. The less
time that's wasted the better I shall be pleased."
"All â¢ right.',' said Wenlock,. pointing to a big package on. the deck.
"Just tell some of your men to shove that case down Into the boat and I'm

â  forthwith enough Wenlock stood wordless In front of the divan; far more
like a criminal than a prospective . bridegroom. The lady, with the tube
of the water pipe between her lips, puffed smoke and made no further
speech. But at last Wenlock. as though wrenching himself into wakeful
ness out of some horrid dream, turned wildly to Kettle, and in a torrent of
words Implored for rescue. â  â  , â  ' , â .
The little sailor heard him quite unmoved. "You asked my help, he
said. "In a. certain matter, and I've given it. and things have turned out

Now the Lady Emir was not listening to all this tirade by any means
unmoved. Although she did not understand one word in ten of What was
being spoken, she gathered the gist of It. She threw away the snaky stem
of the water pipe and gripped both hands on the trooper's sword till the
muscles stood out in high relief. .
"Do you say," she demanded, "you unwilling marry me?
"Yes*" said Wenlock, with sullen emphasis.
She turned her head and gave curt orders in Arabic. With marvelous
' readiness, as though it was one -of the regular appointments of the place,
a couple of the guards trundled a stained wooden block into the middle of
the floor, another took his station beside it with an ominous ax poised
over his shoulders, almost before Wenlock knew what was happening,
he was pinned by a dozen more, pinioned at wrist and ankle, and thrust
down to kneel with . his neck over the block.
"Do you say," the Lady Emir repeated, "you unwilling marry me?"
"I'm a British- subject," Wenlock shouted. "I've a foreign office pass

\/*\7 A Islandâ that' mysterious; vol-
X ; Jl canic rock in the Southern
Pacific where such wonderful
'-./*;. stone giants \ and other pre
historic -relics are found has resulted
in a number of very Interesting discov
eries, to be described in a forthcoming
bulletin of the National Museum by Dr.
George H. Cooke, a . surgeon in the
United 1 States navy. An expedition led
by him made a complete examination
of this notable bit of terra flrma, which
is situated nearly on the line of â  the
Tropic of Capricorn, 2100 miles due west
from the South American coast. His
party did considerable digging for the
purpose of trying to obtain evidence
that would throw light upon the or
igin of the colossi referred to, but all
that could be unearthed was skeletons.
There were numerous caverns literally
filled with human bones, and beneath
the platforms on which the stone
giants formerly stood were chambers
filled with skeletons. The whole Island,'
indeed, was a vast charnel house, and
one subterranean vault of great size
contained an immense deposit consist
ing exclusively of skulls.
The situation of Easter Island fin the
trackless waste of the Pacific is singu
larly lonely, the nearest land being 1100
miles to the westward. It is only thir
teen miles long by seven miles in width
and scarcely a tree s - grows upon ? it.
Nevertheless, It had â¢ formerly . a very,
numerous population, estimated at not
less than 20,000, and the puzzle is -, to
imagine what became of these people
who, Judging from the astonishing ac
cumulations of skeletons, must have
held occupancy for a great length of
time. They seem to have been of a
race altogether different \ from that of
the present inhabitants,' and among va
rious arts they practiced the sculpture
of gigantic statues of stone, the like of
which have never been found in any
other part of the world. The quarries
in which these colossi were hewn from
solid' rock remain to-day just as they
were' left by the prehistoric artists,
whose work seems . to have . . been
brought to a sudden stop by a calam
ity that overwhelmed g the I island and
wiped out nearly everything living
on it. ""â â¢â â 
The voyager who might have ap
proached Easter Island 400 years ago
would have ' witnessed ' a remarkable
spectacle. He - would have A beheld,
placed at intervals along the shore,
great platforms of hewn stone and on
them rows of stone statues with their
faces toAvard the sea. as If represent
ing so many tutelary divinities keep
ing eternal watch upon the ocean in
behalf of the islanders. On one of these
platforms he might have counted fif
teen such colossi, from forty.- to sixty
feet in height. ; This, indeed, was the
platform known as . Tongarlkaâ the
largest and, most imposing of all. ..It
was eight feet in height, nine feet wide
and 540 feet long. ; To-day the plat
forms remain, but all of the statues
have been thrown down and He scat
tered about.' In front of each plat
form is a wide paved space, apparent
ly designed to afford standing room for
a considerable multitude.

Museum Freaks: How They Are Discovered, Live,
Work and Spend Their Salaries
WHAT would you consider a
good salary for a flrst-class
freak? was asked recently of
a number of persons, and In
answer one guessed $6 a week,
one $15, one $30, and one, whose
guess was thought to be out of all rea
son. $100. This is a fair illustration of the
opinion of those members of the public
who have any such opinion about the value
of a really star freak, while as a matter
of fact the salary of such an attrac
tion ranges from $250 to $900 a week.
Equally vague are most persons' ideas
about the lives of the freaks outside tof
the museum. Who they are. where they
come from and .where they go are ques
tions about which most people never
bother themselves; yet some interesting
stories are found in the lives of these
peopleâ stories of a change from lives of

Freaks are the cards on which a wide
awake dime museum manager wins or
loses. This Is not because a great deal
of money Is made from them, the con
trary being the case, when the freak in
question has become a standard attraction
and commands a large salary. In this
case, with the extra expenses In advertis
ing and providing special surroundings,
the cost of the attraction runs up to some
thing like $1200 a week, and after this ls
paid there is little left from the extra re
ceipts. ' But the public Is so skeptical of
everything shown at a dime museum that,
unless a number of these standard attrac
tions is shown every, year, the attendance
will fall off. ';;â¢>,
i It Is in the discovery and presentation
i of entirely new freaks that the money
j and the glory lies, for when one of these
i Is shown at a museum It not only greatly
| increases its reputation, but is a source
| of large profit, for few freaks haA'e at
first any idea of their value, and they
can usually be engaged for a compara
tively small salary. For this reason the
manager of one of the large museums will
traA-el almost any distance, and go to al-
I most any amount of. trouble to secure a
genuine novelty In this line, the more so
I as new freaks are becoming rarer and
rarer every year.
Freaks are, as a rule, persons of a
quiet and retiring disposition, which is
probably due to the fact that almost all
of them came from country places. This
seems rather " strange, the popular Idea
being that life in the city Is not so whole
some as that in the country, and that the
former ought to result in more distorted
forms of life. It is also true that nearly
all of them have gone back to the coun
try, usually to the places from which
they came, where they enjoy the prom
inence that their rise in life has given
them among their old neighbors. Many,

- â¢ Wild Men ' of ; Borneo. . ;i .
Perhaps the best known freaks In this
country are the wild men of Borneo.* who
were brought here : nearly, fifty, years ' ago.
In the interim between that time and the
' present they have . rolled up fortunes for
the several persons who have exhibited
them and have lived to see most of them
dead and burled. As nearly as can be as
certained they were bronght to this coun
try about 1850 by a Captain Hammond,
who found > them on , one of the ; small
islands In the Pacific. He called them the
wild men of ; Borneo because, every one
was acquainted with Borneo as the larg
est island in â¢ the world. Captain , Ham
mond died and they, were taken charge of
by Henry. Harvey of Boston. .After his
decease H. A. Warner of Waltham, Mass..
took them and he has now become blind
from age, so that his son Ernest has. to
take them on the. road, although they, still
? live with his father. In spite of their age
the little 'fellows, are as cheerful and full
of life as when: they 'first came to this
country. Their eyes are bright, their hair
shows no sign of gray, and the only signs
of approaching old age are a slight deaf
ness and a' diminution of their enormous
strength. When they were In their prime
one of them could lift two good-sized men
with ease, although they stand only about
three feet in height, and weigh but forty
five pounds. Even now they are extreme
ly strong and active, but do not lift these
great weights, while their whole life is
much more quiet than it used to be.
- Big Footed Women.
One of the most interesting cases of the
rise of a freak from poverty to affluence
Is that of Fanny Mills, the t footed
woman, who -.was discovered by Frank
' Stone,' the Boston dime museum manager.
He heard other through the postmaster
at Sandusky, ,0., and after a little cor
of bare earth strewn with dry rushes
and grass. Tables and chairs are un
known, and the cooking is done clam
bake fashion In stone ovens, the food â
taro, yams, sweet potatoes, fowls and
porkâ being prepared with the help of
heated stones and leaves. The natives
are \*ery fond of sea urchins and a
species. of small snail, which they re
gard as delicacies. Intoxicants are un
known to them. Women, being in a
minority, are in great demand, and
much consideration is shown to, them.
It is customary for a father to buy a
Avife for his son with stipulated quan
tities of taro, yams, etc., which are con
sumed at . the Avedding breakfast.
Polygamy, in the ordinary sense of the
AA-ord, is not practiced, but a husband
will sometimes rent his wife to another
man. Tattooing is done with soot from
burned leaves, which is mixed for the
purpose with the juice of a certain
berry ? and applied to the skin with
sharp' fish bones. The style of costume
formerly popular Avas the breechcloth
and not much besides, but now, owing
to missionary, influence, civilized cos
tume is adopted, the women wearing
loose goAvns of cheap cotton.
The islanders have no knowledge of
the potter's art, and with earthen ves
sels they are unacquainted, though a
red clay of a fine quality is plentiful.
There are no cocoanuts, and so the na
tives use for drinking vessels and other
domestic purposes the fruit of a sort of
gourd which' flourishes luxuriantly.
They bury their dead in the caves with
which the whole" island is fairly honey
combed, and help is given to the pro
cesses of nature by predatory cats and
rats. Thus the skulls of the defunct
are commonly found filled with the de
bris of rats' nests. Some of the ancient
skulls have peculiar markings, and
these appear to have been the crania of
royal personages.
respondence determined to go out and see
if she was all that she was represented
to be. The farm on which she was liv
ing with her parents was found to be the
most miserable place imaginable, the
house and building out of order, the
ground poor, and eA-erythlng indicating a
.hard struggle for bare existence. The girl
herself was half-clothed and fearfully
i thin and worn' looking. Her work was to
"milk the. cows and then carry the milk for
a distance of five miles to the houses
along the road. She carried two large
pails slung on a yoke across her shoul
ders, and with her huge feet the daily toil
was so severe that, coupled with miser
able food, it had worn her almost to a
skeleton.
* ' Mr. Stone took her to Boston on a sal-,
ary of $85 a week, and billed her as "the
blg-foOted woman from Chicago." She
/created? a great sensation, - and was a
drawing card for a long time.- When she
arrived she had on her feet a pair 'of
boots that showed how primitive had been
her mode of life. They were made
[throughout of the tops of farmers'
'heavy cowhide boots, and had been manu
factured at home by first cutting out of
combined bootlegs a piece large enough
for the sole and then sewing more boot
legs over It from side to side until the foot
was covered. A shoe dealer took these
â¢ shoes to place In his window as an ad
vertisement, and in return made , for her
two of the finest pairs that he could turn
out. MfisÃs_Â£&__SSSl
. Fanny's salary was steadily increased
as it became evident what a drawing
card she was, and when she left Mr. Stone
it was to fill an engagement at $500 a.
week. She was simple and careful ln her
manner of living, and in fact her living
expenses were just about paid by what
she made through the sale of her
pictures. She went back to Sandusky as
soon as she had made enough money,
bought the finest farm In all that part of
the country [ and Is the entire support of
her parents. .
Big Salaries of the Tocci Twins.
The highest priced freaks ever . shown
in. this country were the Tocci Twins, who
received a salary of $900 a" week for a
four weeks' engagement. They were two
.boys with but one pair of legs between
them, the bodies connecting at the waist,
both ': bodies and : legs being perfect and
well formed. They were constantly wor
rying about the high price of living in this
country, and in spite of their large salary
spent as little as they could possibly get
along with. They now have a large and
beautiful place near their native town In
Italy, and are persons of great distinc
tion there.. : â â - â¢ â¢' ' â 
Krao, the Missing Link, i
One of the' most interesting characters
among the freaks was Krao, the missing
link. She was a Burmese, but a ' girl ,of
a good deal of refinement, as freaks go.
She, always had a, governess travel with
her, and was well educated and a hard
student, but she had certain instincts that
she could not overcome. Most of her man
ners at table .were a3 good as those of
most persons,- but she was unable to re
sist the temptation, to stuff food Into the
pouches of her cheeks' and carry it away
from the table to be eaten later. Ordi
narily * her eyes were soft, and of great
depth of expression, but If anything an
gered her they had the fierce, intent stare
that? could be mistaken for nothing but
the look of a monkey.
23STRUGGLING TO SAVE THE OLD MERCANTILE LIBRARY
.. Promiineitjit Men to
the Rescue
-V- -Of the Association.
THE council of the Mercantile IV,.'
brary has been very busy In the
past week forming a committee of
one hundred members to raise $100,000.
It will require that much to pay off
I â¢':" the debt of the library and put it
.on its feet once more.
: "The committee is formed," said George
f A. Newhall, president of the Mercantile
Library Association, when asked about
j the expectations of the gentlemen who
' have the matter in hand: "The action
â¢ will shortly be taken which will proA-e to
. the world that the citizens of San Fran
cisco are proud of their reference library
and will not allow it to become bank
'â¢ rupt." ,
. "What will you do to raise $100,0007'
* "Well, one hundred men have agreed
each to raise $1000. We will not ask any
â¢ questions as to where or how or when they
" get the money. They, have only to get it
and hand it in. We have made out a list
? of the men we think can and will give
â¢from ,S3OO to $1000, and each of the com
â¢. mlttee of one hundred will call upon
: "those assigned to him. What we cannot
raise in that way we are going to make
'â¢ up ourselA-es."
'.*- .The Mercantile Library is dear to every
-.'old San Franciscan. It was started away
ba-ck in the times which gave birth to the
'."Committee of Vigilantes. On December
. 22, 1552, the first meeting was held. Of
those who attended that first meeting not
- many are Avith us now, but IrA-ing M.
â Scott was one of the prime movers.
- "There were a great many young rner
â¢ fcantile men here," said he, "who had
â¢come from every country and under very
â unusual circumstances, j We. were a com
munity alone, cut oft" from our homes in
the East by the mountains and the death
â¢ Strewn trail over the plains. There was
..little restraining influence and great
.'â¢temptations to vice. There were no places
'.â Of legitimate amusement where we could
â¢ spend our eveningsâno. theater, no read
â¢ Ins-roomâ only saloons."
. When the first meeting' was called It
?.was very stormy, but the meeting in the
"chamber of the Board of Aldermen was
packed. Capital stock was fixed at $50,000
?a-!*''. share at $25 each. Two thousand dol
lars, was raised that Dlght and within a
.'fortnight was Ineieaser* to $5000. In the
" following March the formal opening of
-"the library occurred. Rooms in the Cali
fornia Exchange building at the corner
"of Clay and Kearny streets were fitted up.
There was a reading and a smoking room
â¢ and.it became at once the headquarters
.of the better class. The few ladies here
then helped in every way to further the
"good cause, but it was not till the library
.â moved into its own home that a room
'.was furnished exclusively for them.
â¢ It was in 1865 that the lot where the
Mills building now stands was purchased
' for $50,000. They only had on hand $22,000,
but they paid that, and after many coun
cils borrowed $100,000 on the lot and the
building to be. The cornerstone was laid
by .the Masons. General Barnes, who was
."a newcomer then, made the oration. It
â¢ was a great event. Exclusive of tha
â¢mortgage there was still $150,000 which had
: to be raised, and nobody seemed anxious
' to buy the bonds which the association
had to sell.
.â¢' â¢ They held a fair, but it was not a sue
. cess except socially. Next they tried lee
' tures. But it cost the library more to
bring the speakers out from the East
' than the audiences returned at the doors.
Hardships of an Actress Life.
By Mrs. Annie Yeamans.
Mrs. Annie Yeamans recently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of her
â¢â¢ debut on .the stage. â¢ "'-'
This dear, delightful woman is a llAdng refutation of the old belief that
'-" the stage destroys one physically and makes old women out of young ones.
' For, despite her sixty years, she is buoyant with life and health. She comes of
â¢;..* an old theatrical family. â¢ ,'
STAGE life is no harder than . any
other life, nor any more demoral
izing if a girl takes care of her
self. It's the dissipation, not the
work, that wears one out. Heavy
midnight suppers, wine and loss of
"^ sleep are the things that, like rocks about
her neck, drag a woman down to the low-
Vest depths, both morally and physically.
"â¢' it ls the never-ceasing pursuit of pleas
ti.se that is destroying the present genera
' .* tion.
..' When I was young we just hadn't time
to think of anything but work and travel,
.studying our parts and rehearsal. My
â¢ gracious! brandy and \ sodas, cocktails,
.â¢'â¢gin fizzes and highballsâ we never
thought of such things!
." -Those were days of hard work. There
â¢ Was a change of programme every night.
One night we <â  would play, a rollicking
â¢ farce, the | next a tragedy, then vaude
ville or one of the. pretty old-time roman
tic plays, i followed by Shakespeare or
grand opera. I've played all sorts of
' partsâ boy, girl, ingenue, heavy; all
things at all times. The stock companies
in those days didn't carry understudies,
and when a man fell ill or was otherwise
incapacitated I was frequently called
upon to play his part. I have played with
nearly all the great actors of my time.
What men they were, to be sure! What
would happen if David Garrick, Edwin
Forrest, Kean and others whose
names, appear In lurid letters upon
, the pages of dramatic history were
to : j come back and act in tho
same manner as they did when living?
They wouldn't be accepted at the old
rates. There is a vast difference between
â¢ the | acting of to-day and that of fifty
'years, ago. To-day it is catural acting
â¢ that people want. Then it was all blus
.. ter and rant and noise. ''V Â«â¢
.My first appearance on the stage was
.half a century ago as a small boy in
.'â¢white duck knee breeches and sailor
blouse, dancing on 'the stage of a small
. theater In Sydney, Australia. I was An
nie Griffiths on the bill.
'.'ln the entire cast that night there was
no happier or more self-important mem
ber than myself. â¢
When I was 15 my father apprenticed
me to a circus. I was taught to ride, to
walk a slack wire and to do all sorts of
evolutions on the poles and aerial swings.
In fact, I did ; everything from riding in
the entree to the character and double
â¢ acts. Oh, how my small bones used to
ache and what terrible falls and accidents
1 used to have. Still, I liked the life, even
traveling as we did from one mining
camp to another packed like sardines in
springless wagons that bumped the breath
out of us every time we struck a stone or
rut in the road.
One day another circus marched into
the little Australian town' of Adelaide;
where was playing. With its bright red
wagons. Its German band and all its other
many . attractions it fairly staggered the
inhabitants of the little village. With the
, outfit was a New York comedian named
Ned Yeamans. Soon afterward we mar
ried. â '*. '"lt joined the same circus and trav
eled with it to Java, Singapore, Shanghai
and Yokohama. In Shanghai the manager
of the company took ill and the company
disbanded.; My husband and I gathered
together a little band of stranded actors
and gave plays j twice a week in a bunga
low theater which Mr. Yeamans had built.

was with old Charles Wheatlelgh, so long

Said a man of my acquaintance re
cently:
"Do you know that I believe women
would be the most desperate j gamblers

"Nonsense!" was my remark.
"It's not nonsense," he argued warm
ly. "I've watched them, old and young,
pretty and homely, light and dark, and
even in the small games that their
pocket-books and their consciences al
low them to play their excitement . in
winning or losing is something terrific."
And he caused me to do a little think
ing on his side, though not for the
world would I have admitted It to him.
I remembered a game of cards that
caused the separation of two of the
dearest ; and sweetest women in the
world three years ago. "â¢' ;
Of course it was poker.
Poker seems to be played, everywhere,
or was at that time, and this diabolical
cluster of "fulls," "straights," "two

"fours" has caused more, misery and
made more mischief among the women
of this city than will ever be ex

Mrs. C. took charge of.

The two .- amateurs ; gurgled with
amusement.
"How awfully funny," they said.
"Why, we feel like ] real gamblers." .
I declined to join the game, bellevinff
that $5 in the pot was Avorth $20 in the

RUDYARD . KIPLING has ap
parently settled down in the lit
tle Sussex village of Rotting
dean,; some .four, miles to the
eastward of , Brighton. ? The
place is doubtless dear to him for. old
associations' sake.- It- was here that
he spent, his holidays during the period
of his career at WestAvard Ho ! School.
All .the old villagers remember him:
when, as the nephew : of Burne-Jpnes.
he was known throughout the parish as
"â¦he Uttle Indian." . The Kipling ho"=e
is: an old-fashioned place,, surrounded
by a/high brick wall, j and 5 looking out
on * the tiny village green. ; It 'is called
the Elms. ,
: 'y Rottingdean 'is ; a delightful : survival
from the last century a watering place
unmarredâ¢ by railway, facilities, . and
only connected with ? the? outside } world
by a coach which runs to Brighton. .' A

and :* its â â ) out â¢of the â¢ way, -â¢ - pictur- .
measures, and desperate measures had to
be resorted . to. The expedient adopted
was a lottery. Bitter disputes were had
and bitter fighting engendered.
"If we do succeed in raising the money
in such a way," said some,' "it will be a
esque little neighbor. A very ancient
village |is the chosen home of the
laureate of imperialism. The Dooms
day Book mentions it. In the reign
of Richard II ? the French effected a
landing here, and attempted to march
across the downs, capture LeAves, and
avenge the Black Prince's victory at
Crecy. They were opposed by a mere
handful of yeomen; but lost heart and
returned to their ships. The secret of
this mysterious retreat will soon be
made apparent to any one who tries to
cross the downs to Lewes. The cross
ing of those wild chalk hills and deso
late valleys might - well daunt a for
eigner. But if nature has given you a
stout heart, vigorous lungs, and the
ability to climb/ridge after ridge un-
complainingly, the very best way to
enter Rottlngdean 'is by those self
same downs from Lewes. .The village
lies : at â¢: the extremity of & "combe"â a
narrow valley stretching tar inland.,/.
Up this combe, from the very edge of
the great chalk cliffs, winds the single
street; to where the gray old English
, church stands sentinel over the green.
In the little churchyard only a few
weeks ago William Black, the novelist,
was laid to rest, and' the flowers are
still banked upon his grave. In the
middle of the green lies the horsepond;
' and ? all around? are . houses, each of
which possesses an interesting history
of. its own. There is I the vicarage, for
instance, looking '. across the green to
Mr. Kipling's window. Under its high
.root many famous men received their
'"â¢ early * ; education, j among . ? the number
being A Bulwer - Lytton, the great Duke
â¢of Wellington and : Cardinal Manning.
For , the â  old '?} Rottingdean vicars also
I eked out a livelihood by keeping a
school. /â¢; You may - read in the "Earl of
Lytton's life of his â / father how the
great novelist . became "cock of the
school" .. by thrashing a bigger boy
named Moreton. This was under Dr.
T. R." Hooker in 1817. Long before then
Wellington had ?' â¢ frisked about the
green, and learned how to construe In
? the vicarage. To the ? left of the old
school, with its back to a great chalk
/hill, ! is the house /which the late Sir
', Edward â  Burne- Jones built for himself;
.andy wherein he died. Sir Wemyss
Reid "(another > uncle 'Â£â  of Mr. Kipling)
also lives near by; and a new member
of the literary colony here Is L. Cope
Cornford, the novelist. '
â  Mr. Kipling's garden wall stretches
across the' upper part of the green. The
house, as will be seen from the accom
panying picture, is two-storied with an
attic. The front gate (by which a keen
eye can Just discern two of the Kipling
children at play) Is rarely opened. The
entrance is by the smaller wicket, fur-*
ther down; the street, and directly fac
ing the church. The . house was orig
inally built by / Thomas d'Oyley, ser
: ; geant-at-law, in the last ' century. Mr.

time. The Legislature passed a bill au
thorizing the association to hold "three

Those for and those against the lottery
besieged Governor Haight, one side to

made possible. :
General Barnes. President Ralston of

chances were sold at $5 each. There were

and every one. both In and out of the as
sociation, wanted a chance. On the night
of the first drawing $400,000 was lying in
the bank from the sale "of tickets.
Financially the lottery was a great suc
cess, for all debts were paid and still a
balance of $20,000 was standing to the as
sociation's credit at the bank.
This was in 1870, the time of the library's
greatest advance. Many of the most
valuable works were purchased and the
library has many rare volumes, more than
the visitor at the library may. imagine.
But values of real estate and rates of
taxes were groAving rapidly. The building
In the heart 6f the city was with every
year becoming a burden harder to carry.
Finally the building was sold to the tele
phone company, which occupies it now,
and the library was moA'ed then - to its
present: building on Van Ness and
Golden Gate avenues.
Now the library Is In trouble again. No
interest has been paid for two years,
much less any principal. "We can pay
expenses and buy a. few. books, but the
interest is beyond us," said Mr. Newhall.
It is too good a library to have closed,
and It is too venerable to be left to want.
The other libraries of the city may be
more convenient to reach, but not one
has the "booky" atmosphere for real
study and quiet reading which pervades
the Mercantile. - H. GREY.

Some time since we saw an account of
how Bismarck, at the time when it was
thought Germany wanted to get a foot
hold in Holland, was entertaining the
Dutch Embassador with a review of the
German army. As one fine body of men
marched by, Bismarck said to the Dutch
Embassador, "What do you think of these
men?" . f-y:
"Fine soldiers," said the Embassador,
"but not tall enough."
After another body marched by the
same Inquiry was put and the same re
ply made. . Then came the regiment of
grenadiers, between six and seven feet
tall. " y -y
"What do you think of those?" asked
Bismarck.
- , "Fine soldiers, but not tall enough,"
was the reply. " X â¢
>â¢ "What does your Excellency mean?"
said Bismarck. . . ; â¢
"I mean that we can flood Holland eight
feet deep," replied the Embassador

woman ever made a fool of me! . â¢
Sheâlndeed! Who did it, then?â
on the other side of the green, is a
quaint old Innâ the Plough, kept by
one Bleyber, who kneAv the author of
"Recessional" when he was a swarthy
youngster just home from. India. Bley
ber and Mr. Kipling are fast friends;
although they differ widely in politics.
Not long since -Bleyber fell ill, and Mr.
Kipling, by way of cheering him up,
was wont to drop in of an evening to
argue imperialism versus little England
policy. The discussion invariably waxed
hot . so that when Mr. Kipling left, the
innkeeper's pulse had quickened abnor
mally, and he was feverish to a degree
which puzzled the local physician. At
length, however, the medical man
heard of these visits. Going to Mr.
Kipling's house, he absolutely forbade
him to pay (any more visits to Bleyber
"unless he-wanted to murder the man
with . argument." The incident excited
much amusement in Rottingdean; but
nobody laughs more heartily over it

haps, it be the now recovered Inn
keeper. . -. :/./- v : .'
The walk to Brighton from Rotting

A "A farmer carrying his milk to market
one morning stopped at a brook to water
his milk as usual. In dipping up the water
he. scooped up two 'frogs, and into" tne
milk 'they went. .
"One frog said to the other, T am go
ing to drown. I cannot keep myself alive.''
'Well, I am not," replied his companion. T
am going to kick tor. all I am worth.'
"When the farmer reached his destina
tion and the can was opened one poor
froggle was lying dead at the bottom, but
the other ? had kicked to such advantage
that he was quietly sitting on a fair-sized
lump of butter. And that Is what I am
going to do. I am not going to giA'e up
.now and allow myself to drown, but I am
going to kick for all I am' worth." './.-

DEAREST MARGUERITE: out !
Mardl Gras has blossomed out
J) Into "large caps," as the printers
Jl â _y say. These fat imposing letters
are not used lightly and promis
cuously. But once in a blue moon is the
dignity conferred en a social event. It
was by an act of courtesy that the Mardi
Gras before the last escaped the humilia
tion of being dressed for the breakfast
table in short letters. This year the
Mardi Gras won a page of type on its own
merits and on the merits of Mr. Greenway
as a . manager. For It was through his
efforts that it was such an overwhelm
ing success. 'â  '-"}-". ' -*"> *i
"The King is dead!" every row and then
rings out on ears accustomed to the tune.
But Greenway Rex Is not dead, and long
live the King!
'Tis well that this is so. For good cotil
lon leaders are rarer than good major
generals just now. As for good financiers,
they are thicker than blackberries com
pared with the number of men who are
capable of doing the prolonged leadership
act. One cotillon cannot make a leader,
and the second one generally mars him.
There are always two or three "cub"
leaders in training, In order that there
may be young shoulders upon which the
great leader may bestow his mantle. But
Mr. Greenway ranks his understudies
both by right and might.
The years may come and the years may
go, but the memory of this Mardi Gras
will live on forever. For it was the
strangest thing that ever happened and
the most enjoyable. Who was there?
Thereby hangs the entire tale. Who was
not there would be a far easier question.
Society with a capital S sent a goodly
delegation of buds, belles and matrons.
Society with a small s came from Bohe
mia. AaaAAAA.
â It was a pot-pourri. And under the car
nival spirit all barriers melted away. You
scratched a Russian and found a Tartar.
Nor rank nor caste existed. There was
no "keep off the grass" sign on Society's
plat. Every one elbowed with his neigh
bor regardless of Blue Book ethics. Those
who came to scoff remained to play.
The people who nought boxes in the gal
lery deserted them to mingle in the motley
throng. The empty chairs stood as silent
witnesses to King Carnival's power. The
whin's of carnival spirit that floated up
ward were so enticing that they threw
off the guise of spectators to take the role
of merrymakers.
A great manyâ in fact, mostâ the girls
had decided to go home at unmasking
time. Some of them did go, but as most
unwilling victims of stern paternal sug
gestion. All those who could stay waited
until the musicians had sounded their last
note. A^S^^^^^^_%WSfÂ»9*a%
The lights, the music and brilliant cos
tumes all blended to make the affair a
thing of beauty and a joyous memory for
ever. A great many of the girls In our
set simply wore dominoes, and of course
they looked like the merest excuses for
the real fancy dress. The men who wore
costumes did not look so very, veryâ in
fact, a man In other than evening dress
is usually a -looking object.
Every one had a glorious time, and the

sorts of funny incidents and situations
developed through mistaken identity. One
of. the gentlemenâ not in costumeâ who
served on the floor committee has not
yet recovered from a shock he received.
It happened this way: AAfAAA'
Colonel Tâ iiâ bo is seen leaning against
the marble statue of Cupid in the ebony
room. He is watching a green domino,
who is talking to the devil. She lifts her i
"left shouldalre" with the Yvette Gullbert
shrug, and the dimple nestling in the
white flesh mocks him. The pretty, figure,
too. Is dlstractingly familiar, while the ,
twinkle of a tiny beaded boot- and the
sheen of dainty silken ankles catches and*
rivets his attention. She escapes the
devil's detaining hand, there is a move of
farewell, a flash of white teeth, .a lithe
twist and she has gained the main hall
and is lost In the crowd.
The devil saunters over to the colonel
and whispers something in his ear.
The Colonelâ devil!
The Devilâ No, not the devil; she's your
(and he whispers in the colonel's ear.)
The Colonelâ What makes you think so?
Nonsense! Yet there was something
about her that makes me thinkâ
The Devilâ Well, it's a wise man that
knows his ex-wife, costumed for the Mar
di Gras. }
The colonel turns rapidly away, leav
the devil to smile satanlcally and to cool
his cloven hoofs under the marble statue.
The colonel circles' in and out among
the dizzy throng searching for the green
domino.' -.- ; .';"? :AyA<A-AyAyy
Spanish Cavalierâ Noches, colo
nel. For whom seek you?
Colonelâ The green domino.
Cavalierâ You have not good taste. See
the lovely Hawaiian maiden stands alone.
The Baron yon Mustachlos is not near^
I shall depart to bask in the sunshine of
his wasted smiles.
The Turkâ German swords and Spanish
stilettoes! Why stands the colonel alone
with so many hourls about?
The green domino approaches. . - .-
Colonel (aside)â l'd give half my 'power
of fascination to find out if that be really
she. I'll find out.
Colonel (aloud)â I have this dance?
Green Dominoâ l fear you'll lead me a
merry dance. ,
Colonel (aside)â lt is she, and I'll let her
know I recognize her. (Aloud.) Well,
what the divorce codrt has rent asunder
the -Mardi Gras has joined together.
The sprite of the champagne bottle in
corks and with the revenue stamp prop
erly pasted on her neck approaches.
Champagne Girlâ l'm "extra dry"!
Colonelâ "Mumm" is the word. I'll look
out for you at supper.
Green Domino (slipping away)â Guess
again and take beer.

â  find time for large themes in our post
prandial chat. The question has arisen
'among the women here to-night-^ ho
as you see, are mostly mothers of the
, younger set in .ociety-whether the
'â¢â  growth of all this wealth and luxury
is not killing the old-time sentiment of
love." : : ."'. â¢
"In other words," was the answer,
"whether your girls and my boys do not
hesitate a long time before letting the
tender passion invade them, when the
desired object is not financially pre
| pared to aid in advancing the worldly
success of the couple. All I can say
is that in view of what is expected of
unfashionable married pair -in these
days, I hope they do.
"I can't imagine a more deplorable
condition for a poor young husband .
than to see his wife straining to keep
up with her 'set.' I had rather my son
would never marry than have him
handicapped by a dissatisfied, fretful
woman who might be lively and good
humored and agreeable if she had only
means to satisfy the ambitions bred in
her bone." , _ .
"There you are! The old story! Put
ting everything . upon the woman! I
have no patience with you!"
"You must concede that there are
more workingmen than idlers in our
society. That these youngsters see the
girls of their acquaintance trained up
to the ht-bits of princessesâ that is
princesses of a fairy tale, for the actual
ones lead very active, busy, simple lives
by comparison with some of our 'lilies
of the field' In America, And how, in
heaven's name, is the young fellow who
cannot hope to earn more than a few
meager thousands a year in the next
ten years going to bring himself to the
point of assuming to support one of
these expensive treasures?"
"If they could begin life as we began
it twenty-five years ago," mused the
lady, "satisfied with rooms, not a whole
house, content to be entertained with
out entertaining in return on the same
scale with people of fifty times their in
come; if it were not needed to have a
country house as well as one in town,
and horses, and a string of extrava
i gant, impudent servants; to dine out
j five nights in the week and be seen at
' all the operas and balls! I can't find
that my girls, who ire, as every one
knows, the sweetest, most amiable
creatures, imagine another mode of life
than the one we are now leading."
"You convict yourself," said the gen
tleman. "Who brings up the young
people of the hour, if it is not their in
dulgent mothers?"
"Seconded by their indulgent fathers.

saddle horses, and consort in all re
spects with the children of million
aires."
"They are young but once," was the
answer, every line of the speaker's
shrewd American, face softening to
kindness, "and I remember my longing
for outdoor life and exercise, when I
first took on me the office grind of New
York. I like my lads to get their oc
casional ride, even if their horses do
eat their heads off in the stable most
of. the time."
r "And I want my girls to have all the
pretty and pleasant things denied my
meager girlhood. I was the daughter
of? a New England minister, bred in a
provincial town and never dreamed of
the indulgences my children regard as
things of course."
"By our own lips are we convicted.
We have, in short, fitted them for
everything but marriage in the old
time way, without counting cost. ? or
foreseeing disaster should Future not
do her share. But the fact remains that
the young people of our generation are
almost universally imbued with the
idea that love should wait on policy.
The men dare not woo without some
assurance that the girl can help
in the future menage, the girl can't
risk handicapping her lover by going
to him penniless, and unfortunately
for the would-be husband he is gen
erally unable to make the income
deemed sufficient until he is past the
first ardor of his youth.
"I have always thought the French
dowry system an excellent one. But
to have enforced it in our country
would have spoiled some of the best
matches I know. Other times, other
manners, perhaps. In my day, if a
girl's parents gave her dress money
and pin money she was thought lucky.
I laugh now at the memory of my poor
little income, of which I was so proud
when I first married.
"I considered myself quite independ
ent of my dear husband and made it do,
besides, to fill many a household gap.
The girls could not buy their ball gowns
alone with it in these days. I should
not venture to offer such a sum to my
daughter upon her marriage."
"Don't you believe these young peo
ple upon whom we spend so much anx
ious solicitude not to speak of hard
earned dollars are more worldly wise
than we were? Don't you think they,
products of the present artificial civ
ilization, just accept facts as they are,
and suppress. the romantic dreams that
once possessed our dear, artless souls?"
. "No, no," ..cried the lady, her eyes
softened by recollection. "I refuse to
countenance the suggestion. Love is
immortal, policy only keeps in the
background, and occasionally shows
his cloven foot." .-.-;.
"Would you be willing for your lovely
eldest to marry -a young man without
future, making $5000 at most a year?'.'
| "Oh. don't. ask foolish questions,", an
swered his friend, evasively.
"One question more. Why are there
so few marriages in your 'set?' "
Silence was the response. â New York

t&+s4s4<s*W^This brunette is gifted with imperiousness, has her hair dressed over a
semi-circular pompadour roll, but waved, and softened about the forehead
and temples by some short hair curled and fluffed. Strikingly unique is the
floral decoration. Two huge yellow chrysanthemums are flattened over the
"ears, the short stems being caught into the sides of the pompadour. The ef
feel Is marvelous. Shoulder straps of black velvet emphasize the color of
the flowers. Large bunches of violets are worn in the same manner by blondes
and some jetty-haired brunettes bunch short-stemmed scarlet popples or ja
ponicas over their ears, with a result that is artistically Oriental. The scar
let flowers in black hair give a really Japanese impression of combined viv
idness and fragility.

been a trifle neglected of late, and are
just beginning to receive the attention
due them. The Mardi Gras and a private
fancy dress ball have turned every one's
thoughts toward appropriate costumes for
a bal masque. The gowns worn at the
Mardl Gras have been described in more
or less detail, but .those for the fancy
dress ball have as yet escaped printers'
ink.
The most beautiful gown was an exact 1
copy of that worn by the Princesse de
Lamballe in the famous portrait of that
beauty. If you have dark hair and eyes
and wish to choose an effective setting
for brunette beauty, hunt up that picture
and copy the gown. The dressmaker who
fashioned this one reproduced it so beau
tifully that if the Princess had slipped
back to earth she would have cried, "My
â¢gown!" to the beautiful modern wearer.
The material Is an exquisite shade of
rose pink, the panniers of a still more
delicate tint, the under sidÂ« showing a
facing of brocaded pink satin. The bodice
has the soft Marie Antoinette effect. It is
a gown the very simplicity of which chal
lenges description. , â ___
The Queen of Hearts wore a brilliant
red satin gown covered with bespangled
velvet hearts of a deeper hue. Even the
hat was a tiny velvet heart. This is a cos
tume especially becoming to blondes,
Pierette was in white velvet covered with
dizzy black velvet circles. Coat tails,
high ruche and cap completed Pierette's
costume. A rococo shepherdess in pink
and blue and a soubrette in striped pink
and white looked very charming, and
their costumes looked especially fresh and
becoming.
To wear under the jackets the shops are
offering curious bits of workmanship
called collars, but almost any name might
claim an equal suitability, In reality they
are collar and bodice trimming combined.
One example which may be taken as an
authentic herald of the spring mode is a
very high stock studded with jet spangles,
and having here and there an embroidered
chenille star in some bright effective
color.
At the sides of the stock toward the
back are conspicuously high, ear-shaped
pieces of the silk. They tower, winglike,
far above the wearer's ears. They are
made of silk or satin to match the color
and chenille stars ln the stock. Many of
them are edged with spangles.
Other new models have hanging In front
of the stock a cascade of jet beads. Some
collars have but three rows of these In
graduated lengths, but others have seven,
the last row reaching to the waist and
thus forming an effective trimming for
the bodice of any gown.
There is also the coral studded collar,
with Its rows of coral beads. This collar
is usually made of white velvet, with the
high stock scattered with corals. The
velvet ear-shaped pieces are lined with
coral-tinted silk, and in front rows of
coral beads make a graceful garniture
for the front of the gown. Some of these
new collars have beads to exactly match
the color of the velvet used in the stock.
* * â¢
Among the pretty ribbons just creep
ing into fashionable shops are those show
ing handsome embroideries. Among them
are white ribbons with bright red, green
stemmed cherries scattered all over them.
Others are scalloped on the edge with a
brocaded feather design, outlining the
scallops in a two-inch band. Then there
are those with plumed gauze edges and
narrow striped ribbons of all kinds and
colors gathered into little frills for trim
ming summer gowns.

escorting his fiancee to her abode.
She had just made a formal call upon
"his folks," and he was dashing back to
hear their praises of his divinity.
As he put his key into the front door
some demonâ he thought it a good fairy
at the timeâ whispered him to go in
quietly and overhear their delighted com
ments.
So he sneaked into the library adjoining
the dining-room and sat down unseen and
unheard, with an expectant smile upon
his face.
\ Mamma's voice was the first that
reached him:
"She seems a pretty little thing, but
what a weak chin she's got!"
Then his sister Clara:
'Do you call her pretty? Well, I'm sure
I don't. Why, her nose is like a button."
Whom could they be talking of?
"I 'don't think she has a good complex
ion. Why, as she sat by the window her
face was the color of saleratus biscuit."
This was the voice of his sister Mary.
"O! well," broke in mamma: "there's
no use trying to say anything to Horace,
though \ I do wish he had selected a
more stylish girl.
Hew* Horace! Great heaven! they
were talking about her!
He bit 9, corner of a blotting pad, while
his thoughts were those of a pirate.
"And did you notice her earrings
queried C_ara. "I never saw such old
fashioned things in my life."
"I don't ielleve her family amounts to
much," said Mary. "I met her mother at

as being awfully dowdy. Still, I suppose
we'll have to receive them."
The young man burst in upon them like
a whirlwind.
"No, you won't!" he screamed, as he
fairly danced with rage. "No, you
won't! She shall never step foot In this
house again! Why, she could buy and
sell you all in the matter of good looks,
dresses, family, noses and complexions,
and when it comes to mammas"â here his
voice rose to a shriekâ "why, she could
give you all cards and spades and beat
you hands down!"
And he dashed out of the house in a
frenzy, while the women looked at each
other and wondered if poor Horace had
taken to drink already upon discovering
how inferior his fiancee was to his own

fatti's Third Husband.
It is a great tribute that Mme. Adellna
Patti has paid to matrimony in leading to
the altar a third consort. Her first hus
band, the Marquis de Caux. whom she
married in 186S, had the indelicacy to get
a divorce from her on account of her at
tachment for Signor Nicolini.
This attachment survived her marriage
to Nicolini In 18S6, and continued until his
death on January 18, IS9S. If it had been
her sole attachment, possibly she would
have felt indisposed to form another, but
while one sainted memory may do to
cherish for aye, two sainted memories
make a good pair to draw to, and very
possibly Mme. Nicolini has done well In
emphasizing the close of her year of
widowhood by a new alliance.
Her new husband. Baron Cederstrom,
is a Swede, and has lately been engaged

never seen an actual cure of the little

applications of diluted witch hazel, fol

possibly harm you. and may help.

After It has dried on the face smear with
cold cream to allay the irritation.
L. A. B.â First of all. you must get rid
of the matter that is clogging the pores.
This can be done only by scrubbing, the
face thoroughly eacu night with a cam

Her Majesty is now at Osborne, where
she regularly spends Christmas and the
New Year. An amusing story, which I
have reason to know is true, has reached
me. While a regimental band was play

dispatched an aid-de-camp to find out
the name of the piece of music. On his

complying with her Majesty's command
he hesitated, until the Queen insisted on

Speech.
Talk happiness. The world is sad enough
Without your woes. No path is wholly
rough;
Look for the places that are smooth and
clear, ,
And speak of those to rest the weary ear
Of earth, so hurt by one continuous strain
Of human discontent and grief and pain.
Talk faith. The world is better off without
Your uttered ignorance and morbid doubt.
If you have faith in God, or man, or self,
Say so; If not, push back upon the shelf
Of silence all your thoughts till faith shall
come;
No one will grieve because your lips are
dumb.
Talk health. The dreary, never-changing
tale
Of mortal maladies Is worn and stale.
You cannot charm, or interest, or please,
By harping on that minor chord, disease.
Say you are well, or all is well with you,
And God shall hear your words and make
them true.

MRS. S.â For information about moles
please read my little chat with Miss
Hopeful.
AGNES WITHERBEEâ I am sure you
are distressing yourself needlessly over
a condition of the skin that is common
to many women. There is no reason in
the world why you rhould allow such a
trifling affliction to stand between you
and happiness, for I don't believe it Is
really as bad as you believe it to be. And,
believe me. it won't make the difference
that you fancy it will. The trouble is
doubtless due to Imperfect circulation.
Remedy this by lots of outdoor exercise
in fact, the advice that I have just given
Hazel B. will suit your case also. Take
warm baths and scrub the body vigorous
lyâparticularly tue parts afflictedâ with
a flesh brush and plenty of soap. Then
after drying rub well into the skin some
good, pure olive oil. I think a good blood
tonic would also help. Let me know if
this treatment uoes not mend matters. I
feel certain that It will. Here's my hand
and heartiest wishes for your happiness.
Stop worrying. You're a dear, sweet girl,
I'm sure, and tne rest of it doesn't amount
to a one-cent postage stamp.
PANSYâ The astringent wash suggest
ed to Is. -â¢*.. B. is what you need to con
tract the pores. Do not wash your face
with anything but pure mported castile
soap and tepid water. And after you
have dried it. rub well with cold cream.
MRS. F. W.â Please try treatment ad
vised in foregoing letter to L. A. B. It is
just what you need. For the dandruff
use the following tonic: Forty-eight
grains resorcin. one-half ounce glycerine
and alcohol enough to fill a ; two-ounce
bottle. Apply every night to* the scalp
with a small sponge. A cold cream with
out camphor is better for the skin unless
it is very oily, as the camphor is more
or less drying. If you find it agrees with
your skin, then continue its use. *

French beauties realize the meaning of the word individuality. This Is a
blonde, who waves and loosely curls her hair and loops It In a small, soft knot
that gives an infantile expression to the head and reminds one of a very small,
wee girl whose, fractious ringlets are caught up ha single pin when
mamma Is getting her ready for her bath. Then with seeming carelessness
she has placed at one side a bunch of snowy camellias. A large yellow tor
toise-shell comb glinting back the color of the hair is thrust through above
the knot, and beholdâ the embodiment of innocence. One of Raphael's che
rubs could not be more free from guile than this golden head with its nest
ling arrangement of immaculate blossoms.
makes me think of "papa's pears, prunes,
prisms and potatoes," that we used to
say to the prim little girls at school.
The only thing I can suggest for the
palms and hardening of the .skin about the
finger-nails Is to lubricate them each night
with cold cream or olive oil. I wish you
would try tho cucumber milk. It is a
splendid skin whitener. You will find
the formula in reply to Ma i-> W. in last
Sunday's paper. To make the eyebrows
grow use equal parts of cocoanut oil and
vaseline melted together. To get rid of
the blackheads scrub the face each night
with a camel's hair face scrubbing brush,
tepid water and castile soap. Pimples and
blackheads both denote a disordered di
gestion or a diet tco rich to make pure
healthy blood, so you must be careful
about what you eat. Also take plenty of ex
ercise and a tepid sponge bath every day
of your life. I.isterine, in three times as
much boiled water, makes a soothing
wash for facial eruptions. Alternate this
with cologne. In which there is a very tiny
pinch of borax. Use lemon juice to re
move the particles of dirt from under
and around the nail. Develop the half
moon by pressing back the flesh at the
base of the nail, after the hands have
been soaked in warm soapsuds. The nails
can sometimes be given a pinkish hue by
vigorous polishing. If this does not make
them pink enough then art must be re
sorted to.
REGAâ The formula that you Inclosed
is intended to be used as a shampoo. The
water must be boiling and the camphor
powdered. It is frequently used as a cure
for dandruff. Bottle It, and when cold
rub Into the scalp every few days with a
sponge or the fingers. When used as a
shampoo, saturate the hair with it and
then rinse In several clear waters. I do
not advise It, as I think you will find it
very drying to the scalp. The liquid soap
given in last Sunday's Beauty Talk ls
much better. Twice a week is entirely
too often to wash the hair. Tell me what
is the matter with your hair and I'll tell
you what to do for it. or possibly you
found all the Information you wish in the
Beauty Talk of last Sunday. â >
MISS HOPEFUL.â Now there's a name
after my own heart. Am pleased to
know that you are one of my "steadies."
Pleaso read foregoing letter to Prudent
Prim about the eyebrows. You can make
a very good. tooth powder by mixing to
gether carbonated magnesia (powdered),
8 parts; orris root. 2 parts; pure pow
dered soap, one-half part. I really do not
know what to tell you to do to develop
your chin, as it is the jawbone that gives
most of the general outline. However,
you might try to fatten it by massaging
with the orange flower skin-food, but it
will be slow work, I can assure you.
Acetic acid will remove the moles. Dip
the end of a wooden toothpick in the acid
and apply to the center of the mole; tak
ing care not to touch any of the sur
rounding white skin with the acid. Do
this three nights in succession and then
stop. A scat) will form, which, in the
course of two or three weeks, will fall off,
taking the mole with it. Write to me
again and tell me about some of those
other girls.
A. B. Patience must be your watch
word when you start in on beauty cul
ture just as it must be in many other un
dertakings in this life. So, as you have
so little naturally, suppose you cultivate
some. In Sunday's Call of February 5. I
gave directions to Rosebud L. for
reducing a large stomach. I feel
sure you must have seen them.
If you will go through the same
exercises for a couple of months or more
it will certainly help you. The muscle
roller may be of benefit, but I do not

know enough of its results to advise you.
If you use one kindly let me know if you
are benefited. If you wish to reduce the
double chin you must massage with a
good cold cream, taking the flesh up be
tween the finger and thumb*- and rolling
and pinching as much as you possibly can
without bruising the flesh. This dissolves
the fatty tissues. Then, if the skin be
comes flabby, use the alum wash.
LAURA T. P.â you will use the fol
lowing lemon hair wash on your hair It
will. I am sure, bring back the golden
tints: One ounce salts of tartar, one quart
of water and the juice of three lemons.
Use as a shampoo and be sure and rinse
thoroughly in several waters, else tho
hair will bo left sticky and disagreeable.
Washing the hair with the yolk of an egg
in which is a pinch of borax will also help
to keep the pretty golden color.
WALLIS KENYON'â Try one of the
tonics given in last Sunday's Beauty Talk
for the falling locks. The lemon juice and
borax, followed by cold cream, that I have
suggested to J. J. 11. will certainly help
those hands, unless the freckles are of the
"stay-wlth-you-all-the-year-round" kind.
MRS. BRADFORD B.â The red nose in
your case is probably the result of poor
circulation or Improper diet. Avoid rich,
highly spiced foods, hot strong tea or cof
fee, and every form of stimulant. Do not
cat salted meats, but pin your faith to a
laxative diet of fruit and vegetables. Take
plenty of exercise in the open air and
apply witch hazel to the nose frequently
during the day, and rub well Into It at
night the following cold cream: Sperma
ceti, one-half ounce; white wax, one-halt
ounce; oil of sweet almonds, two and one
half ounces; rosewater, three-quarters of
an ounce; powdered borax, ten grains;
essence of cloves, five drops. Dissolve the
borax In the rosewater and add the es
sence of cloves. Melt the first three In
gredients in a porcelain kettle. When
melted remove from the heat and add the
rosewater all at once. Then beat quickly
with an egg-beater until the mixture is
cold and firm. Let the tar water alone,
and if this treatment does not benefit you
write to me again and I will suggest
something else. For the wrinkles there
is nothing better than systematic mas
sage with a good skin food. The benzoin
and water cannot possibly harm your
skin, but the white of egg might.
VENDETTAâ For information regard
ing the hair I must refer you to
last Sunday's Beauty Talk. Advice
given to Mrs. Bradford 8., con
cerning diet, will be of benefit
to you. Scrub the face every night with
a camel's hair face scrubbing brush, tepid
water and pure castile soap. Then rinse
the face in two quarts of warm water, to
which has been added one scant teaspoon
ful of the following lotion: Alcohol, four
ounces; ammonia, one ounce; oil of lav
ender, one dram. Mix by shaking in a
six-ounce bottle, and remember one tea
spoonful of this to two quarts of water
not a drop more.

ANCIENT ORDER WORKMEN.
The 'credentials of delegates to the
Grand Lodge, which will meet on the 4th
! noble and benevolent. Reverence ' and
I veneration are well defined. You are fond
! of praise, but it is only acceptable when
it emphasizes your true qualities. A keen
i student of human nature, you are also
! a born critic. The hand shows physical,
mental, moral strength. The line of life
is strong and well marked. The line of
, head has gained the ascendency over the
I heart line. The Mount of Venus, being
â  abnormally large, indicates strong emo
| tional nature, love of the opposite sex.
I Generous and frank, refined and tactful,
'â  extravagant but not profligate, wonder
fully free from intrigue, your highest ap
: preciation is of art and literature. You
have been a successful public lecturer,
i having a magnetic presence and a versa
| tility which renders you adaptable to all
classes. One who enthuses and elevates,
you are fond of speculation, yet cautious
withal. The Mount of Venus shows honest
family love and the artist wedded to art.
Courageous, bold, daring, original and full
!of lofty pride: the width â¢ between the
third and fourth finger is a sign
Jof independence of action, bohe
mianism, thorough unconventionality.
| Intuitive and energetic, you have a keen
sense of humor. Will and logic are even
ly balanced. Your line of heart crossed
and chained, you permit people to love
you without seeking their society. Your
long Index finger shows .ability to rule
j and great executive ability. Two mar
', riages are indicated and four children;
two will figure prominently in your life.
The strong fate line shows one destined
to be great and a marked willingness to
assume responsibilities. Two lawsuits are
shown and one voyage in the near future,
; which will not come up to your financial
: expectations. With great adaptability to
1 circumstances and people, you are a bril
â  liant conversationist, one who illumines
every topic. Phenomenal success from
; the start is due to capacity and qualifica
tion. Excellent self-control accompanies
, the power to concentrate. A star on the
Mount of the Sun indicates great success
in art. You are decided and determined.
Two ascending lines to the Mount of Jupi
ter indicate equal success in two profes
sions, lecturing and acting. You rule by
kindness rather than force.
* â¢ *
AMEDEE JOULLINâ have a good
i physique, and are level-headed and prac
â . tical, with ability to make money out of
1 your art. You are quick-tempered, pas
sionate, ardent of disposition. Lines
; across the life line indicate liability to
I brain fever brought about by tendency to
j melancholy. A man of great pride, you
! love approbation. A double heart line
I strengthens the intense affection already
manifested in the hand, causing the sub
i ject much sorrow. The line of heart, ris-
I ing between Jupiter and Saturn, the sub
ject will have more passion in his attach
ments, and will be more or less selfish
In satisfying his affections; in home life
he is never so expressive or demonstra
tive as are those with the line from Jupi
ter. This man has traveled much. Very
outspoken. he dislikes to assume respon
sibility. He has great love of chance, and
abundant self-assurance, but is excitable
and willful. His line of sun proceeding
from his line of fate brings him great dis
tinction In his profession. He is intellect

J Singular Life and End of an Aged Mormon in His Cabin oq the Edge of a Call-*

THE strangest man that ever lived I
in California is dead. )
His name was Nils Rltter. and
for nine years he made his home
in a tiny adobe cabin on the sides
lof Mount Darwin, in Inyo County. The j
I exact location of his house was on the
i southwestern shore of Dry Lake, not
! far from Panamint.
For the last eight years Ritter had
I had in his room close beside his bed the
I dead bodies of his two wives, desiccated
by the hot, dry air that blew from
; Death Valley. He was a Mormon, and
I sought the solitude of the desert that he
might live in polygamy without having
to argue the point with the civil author
ities. , - . ;..v a
Just when Ritter died is not known,
but he was found dead a fortnight ago
;by a couple of prospectors, one of
whom, T. R. Wilson, is at present in the
j city. - 'AAyy
"I had known Ritter for a long
! time," said Mr. Wilson, "and always
considered him the strangest freak of
humanity that I ever ran across.
"When he first came to the Death
; Valley country, about nine years ago,
he brought two women with him.
? These, he told a few prospectors, were
! his wives. Neither of the women could
speak English, and the whole crowd
spent nearly all day and all night
singing weird songs.

he was born in Sweden and lived a life
of sin until he was 45 years old. Then
some missionaries of the Mormon
church at Salt Lake City came to Swe
den and made him a convert and also
the two women whom he afterward
married secretly, each in a different
town. '
"We found him stretched out on his bed with the mummies of his
wives standing in coffins beside him."
"For several years all were very
happy, until somebody became sus
picious of his actions, and the trio lied
to Salt Lake City. But changes had
taken place there, and polygamy could
not be practiced as openly as it had
been in years gone by.
"In order to have perfect freedom,
Ritter and his wives came to the Death
Valley country and went into camp in
the cabin on Mount Dawson. But the
women didn't live very long. The al
kali water of a mean spring near the
house knocked them both out in the
same day, after they had been there
about two months.
"Of course nobody knew this at the
time, as the few of us down there
looked upon the whole crowd as a
gang of cranks, and seldom went near ;
them. Even that tough old Indian,
Panamint Tom, never went to the house j
but once. He said he was afraid of
them, and the big pile of provisions in j
the corner of the room had no temp- j
tation for him.
"About a year after Ritter took, up i
his abode in that desolate part of the j
world, I made a call on him. As I an- j
proached the house, I was. a little* sur- !
prised at not seeing anybody moving
about .the place. For a moment- I ;
thought perhaps the gang had moved, j
But one look in the door was enough !
to let me know to the contrary.
"Stretched- out on a cot was Ritter
himself. Dirty and unkempt he was. I
his scraggly gray hair falling in j
tangled masses . over his shoulders.
And on either side of. the bed. standing
bolt upright in a rough coffin, was the
dried-up body of a woman. The sight
almost took my breath away.
'Those are my wives,' said the old
man, pointing to the two horrid-look
ing mummies. 'They passed away to
the other side last year, but they come
back here every day. They were both
here this morning.'
"The old fellow then went on to ex
plain to me all about his strange creed,
his ideas of spirit, unity, and the ever-
I lasting life. He read the strangest
stuff about spiritualism and Mormon
ism out of a big book that I ever heard.

eat. Once a day he went out to the
miserable spring and brought in a
bucket of alkali water. Then he went
back and lay on the cot reading and
â¢listening to voices,' as he used to say
"Whenever I happen, d to be near^the
old man's cabin. I. always went . to
see him. But one visit was just IlK?e
â  the, other. The old man always said
I Just about the same things, and the
, mummies of the dead women only got
j a little dryer as the years went by.
His appearance changed very little ex
cept that his gray hair got longer and
longer and his person dirtier and dirt
ier. I always used to go to see the
old man out of curiosity. I don't be
lieve that any. of the old prospectors
in the neighborhood ever went near
him. From the first nobody liked him.
and they didn't care whether he lived
lor died. And old Ritter didn't care
whether they came to see him or not.
But he always seemed glad to see me.
"About two weeks ago I happened to
be in Ritter's neighborhood with my
partner, and decided to go and pay the
â¢ old man a visit. My partner was all
: curiosity whert I told him what a queer
' freak the old man "was.
.."The idea that anything might be
j wrong never entered my head, even
j up till the moment we stood before the
door. But one look inside was enough.
There was the form of the old man
| lying on the bed,- but he looked almost
i as dry and- shriveled as his mummied
I wives. What a sight it was! For want
of attention the skeletons in the coffin
! had slipped down and nearly fallen out
! of their places.
â¢ "Nothing would induce my friend to
i go inside, but I went in and saw that
I the big book the old man used to read
| had been taken away, as well as every
I household utensil and all the provisions.
; Whether this was done before the old
man died or not I am unable to say.
.but I think it was done afterward. The
dead body was lying straight out; as if
the man had died peacefully.
"I wanted my partner to help me
bury the old Mormon and his two
wives, but he positively refused to go
near them. Such a job was too much
for me to undertake alone, so I simply
closed the doors and windows that had
remained open tor years and came
away. If nobody disturbs them the
dead bodies will remain there for years
and years, so dry is the climate. And.
after all, I suppose that is what would
suit the old man best if he could have
the chance of expressing a wish in the
matter."

The. programme committee of the coun

WHEN THE GRAND OPERA OPENS
ij Forecast of the Coming Season. :
ing. Even our dear old friends the
Bostonians, who are* fated to arrive
here while the grand opera is on, will
figure but smally in" the columns of the
press. Grand opera is in the air and
the music critic wants his innings.
When other subjects exhaust them
selves he always has himself to fall
back on. Herr Bosworth of the Exam
ner, will apologize for hurling Italian
ward the hateful word Dago, and Sig
lor Lucchesi of the Wasp will forgive
him, and they will kiss and make up
and rival neighborly in the fling of the
adulatory adjectives at the delights of
Italian masterpieces old and new. Mr.
Robertson of the Chronicle will bring
forth incontestible souvenirs of the
earliest Patti season and discover a
enascence of "11 belle canto"; Mr.
Davies, the singer's and actor's friend
â¢ f the News Letter, will write impor
tantly about Covent Garden, from Carl
Rosa to Sir Augustus Harris; and un
less Musical Doctor H. J. Stewart is
now of an opinion that Puccini's "La
Boheme" is a finer opera than Puccini's
"Manon Lescaut" he and yours most
obediently will probably revive their
fraternal wrangle of last season in the
columns of the Post and the Call. Now
is the time to subscribe.
Seriously, though, the newspapers
â¢ant settle down to work too soon on
his opera proposition. An opera sea
son has to be boomed just as well as
i bicycle tournament. It is the duty of
every newspaper to convince every
man, woman and child in the vicinity
that this season is too important to be
missed. As I said when Melba visited
us last yearâ with not even the shadow
of the present Ellis companyâ the the
atrical credit of the town depends on
the pecuniary success of the engage-
ment. Melba's short season in the Cali
fornia Theater was fabulously success
ful. Our old records had been long
forgot; we needed some new ones and
we made them. And it wasn't so long
ifter that Charles Frohman forgave

seriously considering a season here
with the greatest opera company in the
world. Everything is off if the Ellis
engagement is not fortunate. And I
think it will be a huge success. Under
the direction of William Parry, late of
the Metropolitan, we are promised a
staging of the old : French and Italian
operas and of "Boheme" such as we
never have seen before. Melba we
know to be the only successor to Patti,
and besides Melba we are to have

It is a pity we cannot hear Gadski in

less give a thrilling performance in
such a work as the "Huguenots." An
other soprano from whom big things
are expected is De Lussan. She has
already made herself felt Europeanly,
so the fact that she is an American
girl need not mar our appreciation.
There is a rumor afloat, not
verified at this writing, that Jean
de Reszke may be induced to
make the trip with the Ellis company.
He is acknowledged to be the greatest
of living singing actors. But do not
set your heart too warmly on Jean; his
coming is .entirely a matter of con-
jecture at present. A tenor certainty is
Bonnard, long associated with the first
tenor parts in the French operas at the
Theatre de Monnaie, Brussels. He has
sung "opposites" to Melba in the Co
vent Garden season, and will do the
same here. Pandolfini is the Italian
tenor, clear and sympathetic, a beauti
ful phraser, and said to excel in the
role of Rodolfo in "Boheme." Ben
saude.is the principal Italian barytone.
We will hear him as Marcello in "Bo
heme." which character he created in
the first production at Turin. Bou
douresque is the principal French
basso. He has held the position for
two years with' the Ellis company.
Rains and De Vrjes and Viviani are
male singers whose work is more or
less familiar to local opera-goers. The
orchestra is. the Boston Symphony, one
of the finest in the world. Seppilli is
the conductor; Richard Fried his asso
ciate. Seppilli is a classmate and inti
mate of Puccini, and one of the great
est of the Italian leaders; so with Melba'
as Mimi, De Lussan as Musette, Pan
dolfini as Rodolfo. Bensaude as Mar
cello, De Vries as Schaunard, Bou
douresque as Colline, Parry directing
the stage and Seppilli at the baton, we
may expect nothing short of a mar
velous performance of the "Boheme."
In all a dozen performances will be
given, selected from, this repertory:
"Faust," "Romeo and Juliet." "Barber
of Seville," "Traviata," "Carmen."

"The Sign of the Cross," Wilson Bar
rett's religious drama, will be seen for
the first time in this city to-morrow night
at the Columbia Theater. The story of
the play, briefly told, is as follows:
Marcus Superbus, prefect of Rome, is
ordered by Nero to exterminate the fast
increasing sect of Christians. He meets
in the street a beautiful young girl who
is defending an old man against an at
tack of the rabble. Interfering, he sends
the girl to her home under the protection
of one of his guards. When he finds that
she is suspected of belonging to the de
spised sect he goes to her disguised as
a boatman and warns her of her danger.
News is brought to the girl while he is
there that Stephanus, a young Christian
boy, has been arrested. He is tortured
on the rack In order to wring from him
information regarding the meeting place
of the faithful. Marcus arrives just in
season to learn that the girl Mercia will
be at the meeting. With his guards he
hurries to the grove where the Christians
are engaged in worship, and is just in
time to save the girl's life. With the
other prisoners she is taken to the palace
of Marcus and there, while a drunken
revel is in progress in the next room, he
attempts to win her for his own evil ends.
Tearing herself from his embrace she
rushes to the door only to find it locked.
Just as Marcus is again about to clasp
her in his arms a flash of lightning, fol
lowed by a terrific crash of thunder,
blinds and deafens him. Holding the
cross above her head, the girl exclaims:
"It is the sign! The Master has spoken!
You cannot harm me now!" Marcus
crouches at her feet, filled with supersti
tious fear, and the curtain falls.
In the next act, urged on by a jealous
woman who loves Marcus, Poppea urges
Nero to refuse to pardon Mercia unless
she will publicly renounce her faith.
Marcus goes to her in her dungeon, where
she is about to go out to be devoured by
wild beasts in the arena. He tells her
of Nero's answer to his appeal and begs
her to live and be his wife. When he
finds that she will be steadfast to her
faith and will not deny Christ, he tells
her that his lingering doubts . are fled;
i that he, too, is. a Christian and will die
with her. Hand in hand they go into
I the arena just as the curtain falls.
The part of Marcus will be played by
I Charles Dalton, and Irene Rooke will im
personate the Christian girl, Mercia. The
entire company is from the Lyric The
ater, London, as are also the scenery, cos
tumes and appointments.

Steeplechase
Another permanent side-show attraction
has been added to the many in San Fran
i cisco in the form of a "steeple chase"
erected in Central Park. The "steeple
chase" is a system of life-size hobby
horses, which carry riders and race on
four parallel tracks. The racing admits
of considerable sport, and altogether the
invention is an improvement on the old
fashioned ' scenic railway. Everybody
ridesâ men, women and children.
jYiusic
Mme. Carreno paid a very pretty tribute
to a local composer, Mr. R. A. Lucchesi,
by accepting the dedication of his "Con
certo Romantico," op. 61. with the under
standing that she play it in Berlin at some
future date, probably with the Philhar
monic orchestra, under the direction of
Niklsh.
Hother Wismer and Fred Mauser will,
with the assistance of Frank M. Coffin,
give a concert at Sherman & Clay Hall
on the evening of the " 28th. The pro

lin concerto, Godard's Concerto Roman
tlque and a collection of songs by Arthur
Sullivan.

â¢-shown by the bank statement for the three

NEW YORK BANK STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Feb. IS.â Financier says:
The deposits of the New York Clearing House
banks, according to their statement of Feb
ruary 18. are within a very small percentage
of $900,000,000. Their cash reserve is $258,666,900, j
the heaviest accumulation of funds ever re- '
I ported by these Institutions. In fact, the cash !
balance of the United States treasury Including
the $100,000,000 gold reserve is only about $14.
--000,000 above this figure. Considered as a re- '
serve it constitutes 26.6 per cent of the enor- |
mous deposit total, or $34.373,525 more than the
25 per cent which is arbitrarily held against |
deposit liabilities. This is almost $10,000,000 In j
excess of the Idle cash reported for the same j
week last year and reveals the remoteness
i under normal conditions of any probability that j
. money may go to an unusual figure owing to j
the activity of exchange transactions and the i
sums required in the financing of new trusts.
| The banks, to tell the truth, are exhibiting a
degree of strength in the face of present de
! mands upon them that is little short of mar
: velous. Within the past week, despite the In
crease of $9,113,100 in deoosits. necessitating
enlarged reserve requirements of over $2,250,000, |
i their surplus reserve decreased only a little j
. over $1,000,000, the cain in cash being due to
: deposit additions. Specie receipts were $3.6-4. -
--! 000, mostly from the Pacific Coast, and losses
lof local tenders were about $2,500,000. This
I shrinkage was due to shipments to interior in
stitutions. But that the demand forecasts a
continued loss is uncertain, as the interior
i banks are remarkably strong in reserves and
will probably be able to supply their own needs
without callinff on balances here. The loan ,
' expansion of $8,567,700, Judging from known
| conditions, ought to be traced to stock ex- |
change sources, especially with reference to
1 securities returned from abroad. But a closer
i analysis of the system Indicates that special
1 operations involving two or three banks at
! most have brought about the Increases and de
' creases. Thus the deposits of one Institution
i have been swelled above $7,000,000, while its
i loans are at least $5,000,000 heavier. Two other
'< banks more than account for the difference last
i week, so that a large majority of the insti
tutions individually considered have added to
their cash resources during the week.

NO NEED FOR HURRY.
Something ls the matter with the sun.
At least that is how a Danish scientist
accounts for the intense heat of the sum
mer and the eccentric variations of au
tumn weather. He claims that the cli
mates of the earth are undergoing an
important change, and that the Arctic
regions are gradually becoming temper
ate and that the temperate regions are
slowly approaching another glacial peri
od, when their surface ls to be covered
for thousands of years with Ice. There
is, however, plenty of time to get ready
for migrating to a place of safety, as we
shall not beglacialized before 10,000 years.
Still, It is just as well to be prepared to
move. Boston Herald.

With loving touch as he said,
"Look at the red blood on his nose, __

"Yes, ma'am, it was your dickey-cat,"

"Dickey must be punished, my dear;

nountaln pass, through which ferocious
â vild beasts and giants were roam
ing. Looking through the pass the
three Princes saw a broad and swift
river that was as black as ink. upon
the waters of which lofty icebergs
crashed together. In the midst of the
river was a roaring whirlpool of such
vast size that it gulped down the Ice
bergs and great sailing ships greedi
ly. The Princes could hear the shrieks
jf the sailors as they were drawn down
by the icy and Inky current.
Then there came into view a small,
slight boat that rocked fearfully as it
glided along. At first, seen in the dis
tance, it was a mere speck. As it drew
nearer the Princes saw that it con
tained a lovely girl, whose hands; and
feet were bound with clanking chains.
Her head was bare, excepting a crown
of jet black roses. About her should
ers was closely drawn a JET BLACK

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1899.
"You may hold him just a minute
While I press the garden gate."
They pass through to the other side;
But they do not go quite away.
Curious. I watched them there,
And, thinking that they were at play,
I over the fence did peep.
No; there was a task to be done.
A hole was dug. narrow and deep,
And then carefully laid inside,
And covered over with earth.
Was the poor little chick that died.
And now they are up and away,
The brown eyes and the blue.
A child's grief lasts but for a day,
Though children's hearts are ever
true.
Only justice did they demand; .
And fully justice shall be done;
If Dickey, the cat, comes home
Before the to-morrow's sun.
She kissed , us and we went into the
house and rested ourselves awhile.
Then we went in the orchard and
climbed up the trees which Aunt Kate

UF STORY CALLS FOR FICTURE
THE school' teacher that Igo to ev
ery night at the Lincoln Night
School is paid very poorly for
her wearisome taskâ imparting
wisdom to her noisy pupils.
One little boy in my class finds it very
difficult to understand simple arithme
tic.
"Suppose, Fritz, you have a stocking
on one foot and you put another on the
other foot, how many would yod have
on both feet?"
The answer came back, "I never wear
stockings."
Suppose your father has one pig in a
pen, said the teacher, and he buys one
more, how many would he have then?
The little fellow came back with the
reply, "Dad don't keep pigs."

Cleaving the wave* and surrounding
the boat was a multitude of huge croc
odiles, leaping at the boat with hor
rible mouths wide open.
"These seeming crocodiles," said
Atoll, "are also sons of Atrid, who had
one thousand sons. All are magicians,
and I am the Queen of them all. When
I command they must all work the spell
that I wish." The cruel Atoll's lips
curled with pride.
The three Princes hardly heard Atoll,
because they were watching the Lady
of the Black Robe so closely. The boat
drifted near an island and the Lady
would have thrown herself into the
water, hoping to escape, but the croco
diles crowded close to the boat and
each tried to reach the Lady.
She sank into the bottom of the boat
in despair. Now the boat was caught
by the outer circle of the whirlpool's
waters and began to follow the path
that was leading the icebergs and the
ships down to destruction, In the throat
planted an apple tree fifteen years ago.
It has fine red apples on it.
After dinner we went into; the or
chard and picked some apples to take
home to mamma. We stayed until 4
o'clock. Then we started for home.
We caught the 4:30 o'clock train, then
the boat. We arrived at San Francisco
at 5:30. When we got home we went
right to bed. We were so tired. Our
journey had been pleasant.
The pastor of a certain church on
leaving his study, which is in the rear
of the church, one day last week, saw
a little girl friend talking to a stranger.
"What was that man saying to you,
Madge?" he asked as he came up to
her. * _ , '
"Oh," said she, "he just. wanted to
know if Dr. C wasn't the preacher of
this church." . _ ââ â¢ _ _
"And what did you tell him?" asked
the pastor. .' Vty
The little girl drew herself up with
an air of great pride.
"I told him," she answered with dig
nity, "that you was the present in
cumbrance."

BLOCKS AND A LOT OF THEM TO
The teacher blew a heavy sigh from
her lips and went at it again with re
newed courage.
"Suppose you have one jacket and at
Christmas your father makes you a
present of another jacket, how many
jackets would you have then?"
' "He ain't that kind of a father; he
never gives nothin' for Christmas." '
"Suppose your sister gives you one
apple and you have one already, what
will you have then?" y'yAy
"Stomach ache. Our apples are cook
in' apples." â¢ '
The teacher with a pleasant smile
was not to be discouraged by trifles.
She began to suspect that the little
fellow. was not well up in arithmetic,
but she resolved to make one more ef-
of the whirlpool. Slowly at first, then
faster and faster, the boat moved. The
crocodiles would not dare the whirl
pool, but stopped at the edge and there
swam back and forth. The boat, with
its precious burden of the Lady of the
Black Robe, mounted on a rim of water,
high above the surrounding waves.
Then the Lady, about .0 be drawn

crocodiles. The crocodiles surrounded
the island, so that there was no way
left open to escape. The Lady fell upon
her knees and cried aloud: - â¢
"Oh, for one minute of freedom But
for these fetters my magic would be
good yet." rr ;i : v *a,T*
"Very true," said Atoll, to the three
Princes, "if she could only reach the
flowers of the tree which is upspnng
ing above her head, she might work us
much harm and take the spell from
your father's kingdom. Butâ look!
The three Princes would have rushed
to the rescue of the Lady, but the black
dwarfs closed around them and hedged
them In with a wall of menacing
swords. .
A huge crocodile crawled upon the
island and, standing upon his hind feet,
embraced the Lady of the Black Robe.
His frightful arms were about her; his
eyes glared Into hers; his breath hot
and foul, was in her face.
"Oh. oh!" shrieked the Lady.
"My bride you* must be," said the
crocodile. "With me you shall forever
dwell and reign In the mud and ooze of
the river bed."
"Spare me, oh. spare me.* . .J -

"No, no, not that."
"Come then, down into the ooze.

The face of the Lady of the Black
Robe was white with sudden fear.
"So be it then," she said, "the daugh

Robe shall be yours, but, when I con

A STORY OE A GREAT SOLDIER*
FREDERICK THE GREAT one
day, sitting in his study, rang the
bell several times, but nobody
came in response to his summons.
At last, growing impatient, he
opened the door of his antechamber and
discovered his page fast asleep. The
king, much annoyed, was about to
awaken him, when he discovered a
written paper hanging out of the boy's
pocket.. Kings are not above curiosity
any more than ordinary mortals, and
without scruple his Majesty softly drew
out the paper without awakening the
sleeper and read it. He found it to be
a letter of thanks from the page's
mother, in which she blessed her boy
for his thoughtfulness and devotion in
sending her "the greater part of his
wages. It had been a great help to

"Our slave, our slave!" shouted the
multitude. "See! She is free! Chain

The Lady rested her hands upon the
tree upspringing above her. With a
quick motion she showered down a
storm of. snow white .blossoms in a
circle around her. Smiling, now, she
faced the one thousand fierce sons of
Atrid. Within this circle they could not
come, for the. tree bore Wizard Flowers

"Hurrah," said Alfred, Arthur and
Egbert, "she is free."
Not yet. With wonderful strength

WAR PUZZLE-TWENTY FAMILIAR NAMES.
BY C. D. FEATHERSTONE, SANTA CRUZ
WHILE watching a fishing smack in Leyden we tried to engage
in conversation with an old sailor who bartered and traded vege
tables. After an almost vain effort to understand him, we heard
him mutter' something like this: "Rothemi Lester? Avalon
Gardens. Ha! ha! Van Alden is a shrewd man!"
Leaving him, we passed a small house, which was painted red and
bore the sign, "Sam P. Sontag. English tutor." He seemed to be a re
markable teacher, for we heard him say, "If one is a unit. Ed, state
some other unit." Then, giving Ed time to think. he started another
- boy's thoughts in this direction: "Philip, pine trees are natives of what
countries?"

wisdom, or a salary, he certainly loses no time.". ."Seh! Leyden school

' Walking on past Jan Utsig's bee farm we met a strange couple, who
looked like provincial Germans. The man walked very clumsily, and no

After he had read this Frederick went
back to his study and brought a rou
leau of ducats, which he slipped with
the letter into the pocket of the boy.
Then, closing the door of the ante
chamber, he went back to his desk and
rung the bell with such violence that
he soon awoke the page, who hurried
into the room.
"Surely you have been asleep!" thun
dered the king, glaring at him fiercely.
The poor lad, much frightened, tried
to stammer out a confession or excuse,
and in his agitation he thrust his hand
into his pocket, where he found the roll
of ducats. Confused and trembling he
drew it out, and stood looking first at
the king, then at the money, utterly in
capable of speech.
"What is the matter?" asked the
king, hiding a smile behind his hand.
"Alas, your Majesty?" cried the boy,
falling on his knees. "My ruin is in

indeed, I know nothing of it."
"Why," said the king, "whenever for

i your better judgment. You are decided

well balanced. You are far too esthetic
to come down to the drudgery of life,

David Hewes and William Patterson
were yesterday, sued for $20,000 by J. B.
Louthan, on account of injuries received
by his wife, Mary, through .1 fall. The
complaint alleges that on the evening of
June 21, 1897, Mrs. Louthan was leaving
the hall of the "First Progressive Spirit
ual Church," and in attempting to reach
the sidewalk she was compelled to. walk
down some cleat steps, the building then
being in a state of repair; that her heel
caught in one of the cleats and she was
thrown violently down the Incline and
severely Injured.
Hewes was the owner of the building
and Patterson was the one engaged in
making the repairs, so both were Joined
as defendants. The plaintiff (â  further al
leges that the defendants , were Informed
the day previous of the unsafe and ; dan
gerous condition of the stairs and .-further
that a large crowd of people would use
them the next day In attending the meet
