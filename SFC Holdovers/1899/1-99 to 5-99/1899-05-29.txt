MISSIONITES DENOUNCE
THE FRANCHISE STEAL
Indignant Citizens Applaud the Intimation That a Good Stout Rope
Would Fit the Case of the "Solid Seven."
Banded Together, Three Hundred Strong, They
Will March To-Day to the City Hall to
Vigorously Protest Against the
Proposed Infamy, .
JUDAS heads the list of those who
have bartered their mortal souls
for coin. Are the' solid seven of
the Board of Supervisors ready
to complete that roll of infamy to
date by adding their names to itP
It looks like it. They seem to have
sold themselves, body and breeches,
to the Southern Pacific and the Mar
ket-street Bailway Company, and
those corporations are accustomed to
exact the limit once they pay the
price. The limit in the present case
consists of a double track franchise
for a steam railroad from Third and
Townsend streets to the county line
' and a blanket franchise for electric
street railways, to defeat for fifty
years the operations of the new char
'< ter and shut out competition.
They asked for these things Mon
day a week ago. Three days later the
Street Committee of the Supervisors
recommended the passage to print
of the resolutions, and to-day the
"solid seven" stand ready to do the
bidding of the corporations.
The "solid seven"' has never been
known to do anything for nothing,
anu it is not probable, at this late
day, that they would change their
rule. The haste they have shown to
do what the corporations required
would imply that they are not only
â¢out for the stuff,'' but that they
have received it. In their eagerness
to deliver the goods they forgot even
to give such semblance of good faith
j to their acts as to allow the usual
ume to elapse between the application
for an important franchise and its
full consideration. That is why they
propose this afternoon to rush the
resolutions to print.
They will not do so. brazen as they
are, shameless as they have proved
I themselves, without a protest that
i will make them quail. At a meetin-g
held yesterday three hundred citizens
of the Mission applauded the state
ment of one of their number to the
effect that the "traitors needed a
rope/a nd they pledged themselves to
descend this afternoon on the Super
visors, protest against the contem
plated infamies, plead with the
"sordid seven" not to do this thing,
and. finally, if the betrayal was com
pleted, to storm the chamber with
their indignation.
The "solid seven" may even stand
that. A few hours will tell. Will
they complete to date the list that
Judas leadsP
Throe hundred residents and prop
erty holders of the Mission, voicing thÂ»
Indignation of the citizens of that pop
ulous section, will march in a body this
! afternoon to the City Hall to protest
' by their presence against the passage
â¢ to print of the resolutions recommend
: ed by the subservient Street Commit
tee granting a. double-track franchise
I to the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany and a "blanket" franchise to the
j Market Street Company for its lines
| over the streets of the city. A speclal-
I ly appointed committee of ten .will put
! the protest into form and ask that the
proposed treason be not consummated.
If, in the face of this, the solid seven
| vote to betray the people the three
' hundred present will arise, and, crying
"shame on them," point the linger of
| scorn at the traitors who have earned
their thirty pieces of silver.
No ropes will be taken to the City
Hall, as has been suggested by more
than one, and no attempt will be
! made to string up any member of the
"solid seven," but there is no telling
; what exciting incidents may take
place if the seven carry out their
avowed purpose.
"Do not betray us! Do not betray
I us:" will be the cry of the three hun
-1 dred, and it would be indeed a defiant
I lot of Supervisors to face the storm
that is prepared to break at the first
sign of treachery. The cry was voiced
first yesterday afternoon by one of the
speakers at an indignation meeting of
. iiizons and property owners of the
Iffssion at Mangels Hall, and it was
taken up by three hundred volunteers,
who raised their hands in pledge of
their Intention to join the march to
the hall.
The meeting was held at the call of
the Mission and Potrero Improvement
Club, and long before the hour when
Chairman T. B. Slevin called it to or
der standing room was at a premium.
I The men assembled were solid citizens
i of the district and they were not slow
i once they got down to business to voice
I their views of the shameless "solid
â¢ seven" and the franchise steal their
votes were purchased to legalize.
In calling the meeting to order Chair
man Slevin recited the history of the |

I franchise grab, already so well known
'to the citizens of San Francisco. He
j told how last Monday the double-track
; resolution had been hurried to the

and had come before It on the succeed

go over till next Thursday, when they
i could have a hearing. The club repre

; they had hardly got beyond the door
j of the committee room ere Aigentinger
! and his associates, eager to do the bld-

; and talked with him about the ad

MISSION RESIDENTS
MAKE A PROTEST
THE citizens of the Mission have risen to protest against the cut
and-dried infamy of the Solid Seven of the Board of Supervisors.
In mass meeting assembled yesterday they denounced them as
traitors to the people, and planned to descend upon them in a
body to cry out against th c delivery of the city, bound hand
and foot, to the Market-street Railway and the Southern Pacific. At
the indignation meeting in Mangel's Hall the following protest was
adopted and signed by all present:
SAN FRANCISCO. May 28, 1899.
To tho Honorable the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San
Francisco:
"We. the residents and property owners of the Mission, do hereby protest
against the proposed granting of permission to the Southern Pacific Com
pany to lay a double track for railroad purposes from Third and Townsend
Streets to the sourtherly boundary line of this city and county along the
present route now pursued by said company and for grounds of protest and
objection name the following:
That the benefits conferred to this municipality will be more than offset
by the deterioration caused to the property of the adjoining owners through
the nuisances created in consequence of an additional number of trains being
run than at the present time, resulting in the undermining of foundations,
pollution of the atmosphere, greater and enhanced alarm of fires from sparks
and an increase of fire insurance rates to said owners, detention and delays
of street cars at crossings, the hazard to life and limb of citizens, and also a
condemnation of homes erected by the people of this city which have made
the Mission district a district of homes convenient for themselves and to
their places of labor.
That no occasion for this change exists, as the Southern Pacific is owner
of land along the bay shore where a roadway leading to our principal depot
could be constructed, thereby facilitating greater convenience to the public
in goneral and less damage to our people.
Wherefore, the citizens and property owners of the Mission humbly pray
that your honorable board will faithfully represent your constituency by re
fusing and denying this unjust request of the Southern Pacific Company.
It was decided, also, that copies of this protest would be left at
various places in the district for such citizens as wished to sign up till 2
o'clock this afternoon. The places selected are: H. F. Wynne's drug store,
Twenty-second and Folsom; George Mangel's grocery, Twenty-fourth
and Folsom; Mitchell Bros.' grocery. Twenty-fourth and Harrison, and
John Green's grocery. Twentieth and Harrison.
"We have his assurance," continued
Slevin, "that he will act in our behalf,
not allowing it to go before the board
to-morrow by reason of the fact that
the committee will not. report on it.
This will give us the opportunity we
desire of protesting. to the Street Com
mittee next Thursday."
The chairman then called upon
George L. Center for a statement of the
case concerning the double-track fran
chise, and Secretary E. D. Sullivan
read the following, which had been pre
pared for the occasion:
The facts and reasons why tho
doublf-track steam railroad franchise
should not be granted:
The San Jose Railroad Company
has not nor never had a franchise
from the city for its route from Six
teenth to Twenty-fifth and Valencia
struts. Whatever rights it may
have, have grown out of usurpation.
That the railroad passing through
Bald district passes over and along on
the sidewalks, In one case for a dis
tance of over eiKhty feet, making it
an impossibility to improve the prop
erty along its route; and that where
improvements already exist, on ac
count of the dust, smoke and noises
at all hours of the day mid night, it is
almost impossible to rent houses or for
people to live along its route on ac
count of the nuisances caused by the
trains. It is also detrimental to land
values and exceedingly dangerous to
life and limb. Probably 80.000 people
cross and re-cross these tracks daily,
thousands of whom are children. Also
all the street teaming and car traffic
on all the main thoroughfares leading
out of the city, from Fourth und
Townsend to the county line, are corn
nulled to cross these tracks at all
hours, at a great risk to life and limb.
The Street Committee of the Board
of Supervisors, without consulting the
people Interested, or giving them an
opportunity to be heardâ as they prom
isedâhave recommended that the .
steam franchise be granted for an In
definite time, thus making a nuisance
we have believed to be temporary, per
manent.
This action in the face of the ad
vanced methods of motive power of
the present day. the Street Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors pro
pose to perpetuate this steam nuisance
through this thickly settled portion of
the city, so far as they are concerned,
for all time. Electricity as a motive
power has now advanced to such per
fection that its use should be compul
sory throughout the residence portions
of the city.
These elected guardians" of the peo
ple's rights seem to regard these rights
as their own individual perquisites to
be bartered away for their own per
sonal benefit. The question is, How
long are the people going to submit to
this condition of things, and what are
they going to do about it?
Chairman Slevin called attention to
the fact that the company had made
"an entire change of front concerning
the double-track road since its attempt
to pass a franchise through the Super
visors a year ago. At that time, he
said, Attorney Foulds had contended
that by reason of the fact that the Hne
was marked on the official map the city
had granted permission to run the line
across and along its streets. Now, said
I Slevin, Foulds contends that the com
pany has been in undisturbed posses
sion so long that no power this side of
I the Attorney General of the State
' could disturb it.
In line with these remarks of the
chairman, the secretary read the fol
lowing communication, which had been
prepared and a ropy of which will be
presented this morning to each Super
visor:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., May 29.1599.
To the Honorable the Board of Su
gervlsors of the City and County of
an Franciscoâ Gentlemen: In order
that you may understand the position
of the residents of the Mission district
in relation to the proposed granting by
you to the Southern Pacific Company
of permission to lay a double track
along the present route of said com
. pany extending from Third and Town
send streets to the county line we
herewith submit for your consideration
the following facts:
Firstâ The San Francisco and San
Jose Railroad Company possessed a
right of way and operated a railroad
from 1854 to 1868. The route of said
railroad extended from San Jose to
San Francisco, and its terminus was
at the junction of Market and Valen
cia streets.
Secondâ The Southern Pacific Com
pany was granted a franchise along
Townsend street in 186â.
Thirdâ ln 1868 the Southern Pacific
Company purchased the stock of the
San Francisco and San Jose Railroad
under permission of the Legislature.
They owned repair shops at Sixteenth
and Harrison streets, and Mr. John
< 'enter, who. then owned the greater
portion of the Mission, which .was In
those days large fields, granted to the
Southern Pacific Company temporary
permission to lay a spur track from
Twenty-fifth and Valencia streets to
the said repair shops. In 1870, when
the residents of the Mission section
learned that said railroad was likely
to become permanent, they protested
to the tracks remaining in their midst.
The i railroad company assured them
that it had no intention of remaining,
and 'made application for a â  right- of
way- along the bay shore.'. The rail
road was granted -a right of way in
1870 along said bay shore, and was also
presented with about a hundred and
twenty acres of land at the end of
Third 1 street for depot purposes. The
railroad, never moved its tracks, and
replied time and time again to the pe
titions' for removal that they would
do so as ; soon as- their bay shore line
would be- completed. The bay , shore
line has never been commenced. Now
they tell us and you that they will
never abandon said road. They have
no franchise to operate from Sixteenth
?Â«S e & l %> Vi , l i en cia, and it is only rot
for Mr. Foulds to say that the city has
lost ts right to its streets because of
thÂ» L en th 'Â° f "i 116 â¢ intervening â  since
the first " railroad operated its trains
vÂ« On c -f* l^'" The city never loses
its rights to its streets. . .
Now the present" railroad is a nui
sance. : It operates through a thickly
settled j portion . of San Francisco- set
tled, - unfortunately, by poor . people
\Y c . say unfortunately, for it seems to
be pretty well. defined 'that wealth has
more claims upon public, officials than
has poverty, even though there may
be no differences on election day
Thousands of property owners' are
daily. annoyed by this railroad; thou
sands of children daily cross its tracks
to the great danger of their lives
thousands of sick and nervous persons
are Injured by the noise of passing
trains. The result of all this is that
property has depreciated in value in
our. midst, and though the Mission is
favored by nature, still the Southern
Pacific Company, through means only
known. to God and the Boards of Su
pervisors, insists on maintaining this
nuisance. In i European cities such a
nuisance would not be tolerated Rail
roads â  should â¢be â¢ operated in sections
of cities away from the residence por
tion thereof. The contemplated action
of you gentlemen in granting permis
sion' to lay a double track simply
means that our homes will be lost for
ever to us. No one desires to live
along. the route of the railroad No
property owner can now dispose of his
property. Within the last thirty
years property, on account of the rail
road, has depreciated In value 50 per
cent, and , this | double track means
simply that property valuations will
further depreciate.
We therefore appeal to you as citi
zens and ; taxpayers to . stand by us
You are our servants. Over 25.000 of
us are to be affected by your action to
day. We elected you to office, and we
want you to serve our purposes. Let
nothing swerve you from your duty.
Let your; motto be the greatest good
to the greatest number. Stand upon
your rights and the rights of your fel

Ppeclal Dispatch to The Call.
CHAMBERLAIN, S. Dak.. May 28.â
Word reached town this evening of a
disastrous and fatal tornado whii-h
passed across the country in the vicinity
of Bijou Hills, twenty-five miles south
of this city, yesterday afternoon, re
sulting in the death of seven persons
and the serious injury of two others.
The killed are:
CHARLES PETERSON.
SIX CHILDREN of Charles Peter
son, ranging from 3 to 15 years of age.
Peterson's wife and two other chil
dren were so badly injured that they
may die.
The tornado formed on a section in
plain view of hundreds and moved in
a southerly course, the first place
reached being that of Arthur Coden,
which was totally destroyed. The
storm then destroyed a church and a
schoolhouse, after which it reached the
Peterson place, where the execution
was simnlv appalling. The dead and in
jured were strewn about the premises,
all being bruised and maimed in a
shocking manner, while the buildings
were crushed into splinters.
After doing its worst here, the tor
nado passed into the range of hills
skirting the Mississippi river, where it
appears to have been dissolved. Every
thing in its course was completely de
stroyed. The path covered oy the tor
nado was only about twenty-five rods
wide and about three miles in length.
The wind was accompanied by a heavy
fall of rain and hail.
This was the first tornado that ever
appeared in this section.
OMAHA, May 28.â A special to the
; Bee from Central City, Nebr., says:
: Probably the most destructive tornado
I that ever visited Nebraska passed
through the northern part of Hamilton
County last night at 7 o'clock, destroy
ing from $75J000 to $100,000 worth of
property, including fifteen dwellings,
one church, one schoolhouse, two iron
bridges across Blue River, barns, corn
cribs, out buildings, orchards, fences
and stock.
The funnel-shaped cloud first struck
the farm of Peter Jacoby on section 8,
township 11, completely destroying the
house, barn and other buildings. The
cloud then arose and did not again
strike the ground for two miles, when
it again descended and caught the
dwelling, barn.outbuildings and wind
mill of W. P. Lantzen, leveling them.
The residence and outbuildings on the
farm of William Steel, C. R. Eastman
and T. L. Clothier were leveled to the
ground.
On the Clothier place the family had
taken refuge in a cellar. An Â©Id-faeh
ioned hay knife stuck in the wall by
the side of Al Clothier's head. The
knife was blown from Eastman's place,
a mile away. W. W. Shenberger's farm,
occupied by GeorerÂ° Noble, was the
next one visited. All the buildings were
leveled to the ground. The family had
taken re/uge in the cellar, and while
there a horse was blown in. The horse
was killed, but none of the family were
were injured.
On the farm of Mr. Liebhart, one of
the finest in Hamilton County, the
house, barn, corncribs, granaries and
outbuildings w.ere smashed into kind
ling wood and a large oi chard ruined.
Cottonwood trees nearly two feet in
diameter were stripped completely of
their foliage, some were uprooted and
others twisted off. Many hugs, two
horses and a number of thoroughbred
cattle were killed.
The residences of Peter Herningsen,
Hans Luff and A. R. Buck, with all
outbuildings, were scattered to the
winds.
The Danish Lutheran Church, togeth
er with a schoolhouse, parsonage and
large barn belonging to the church,
were wrecked. Rev. Mr. Strandskow
and family and the family of Nels An
derson, nineteen persons in all, took
refuge in a cellar under the parsonage.
A large steel range dropped into the
cellar, but fortunately no one was in
jured. Every monument in the ceme
tery adjoining the church was either
turned over, broken or destroyed.
A little north of the church the storm
crossed Blue River, taking the iron
bridge, carrying It a hundred feet or
more and twisting it into a tangled
mass.
Other residences destroyed were
those of R. Olson, Chris Hansen, Chris
Rasmussen, I. C. Anderson. C. P. XH
son and George Cayahan. Cayahan
was slightly injured. A. P. Johnson's
place was the last in the track of the
storm to meet with loss. All his build
ings and much stock were lost.
The track of the storm was sixteen
miles in length and about 100 yards in
width. During the blow a little rain
fell, accompanied by immense hail
stones. In nearly every case the fami
lies sought shelter in cellars. While
there were many narrow escapes,
strange to say no one was seriously in
jured. The loss to crops will be slight,
but groves and orchards were ruined.
A majority of the t farms were insured,
but it will be impossible for several
days to get the amount of individual
losses. Household goods and clothing
were all destroyed. Probably 5000 peo
ple viewed the scene to-day.
BEATRICE. Neb.. May 28.â A severe
hailstorm visited Beatrice early this
evening. The storm came up suddenly
and hundreds of people were caught
while driving. Several runaways oc
curred, ia which many people were In2

Cox, whose Bhoulder Mad.- waa broken,
and his wife, who sustained painful
bruises. Dead birds liÂ«- in the streets

MONTEREY PLANNING
FOR A CELEBRATION
Proposed Jubilee on the Fiftieth
Birthday of the Constitution .
of California.
MONTEREY, May There is a. move
ment on foot among the pioneer, Monte
reyans to arrange a 'ration in "Mdnte
rey of the fiftieth annivorsay of the day
on which the constitutional convention
completed Its work of drafting a consti
tution for the State if California. Great
interest in the project is being manifested
by the citizens. The constitution was com
pleted on October 13. 1849, but was not
formally adopted till Che banning of ISSO.
The plan is to set October 13 of the pres
ent year as th occasion for the .semi-cen
tennial celebration, which is to be partic
ularly Californian in its character and to
petition the Governor to proclaim that day
a State holiday, to be designated as Con
stitution day. The pioneers throughout
the State re enthusiastic over the plan.
Colton Hall, the building in Which the
constitutional convention Fat. is still
standing, though greatly in need of re
pair, owing to the lack of funds to keep
It up, and many of the old landmarks of
the pioneer era are to be found- In and
about Monterey, which in the light of
such a celebration would take on a new
interest to residents of the State. The
desk upon which the draft of the con
stitution rested while being signed and the
pen used by the signers are still in exis
tence, the latter in the possession- of the
family of the late Dr. James L. Ord.
whose brother. Judge Paciflcus Ord, of
Washington, D. C, is the only surlvor of
the members of the celebrated convention.

British Government Finds No Reason
Why the Sentence of the Court
Should Be Set
Aside.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May Â£S.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
I Groat Britain has again refused the re-
I quest of the United States that Mrs. May
brick be pardoned. This is the result of
another application made for her release
| by Embassador Choate, who has just ca
i bled to Secretary Hay the answer he re
! reived from the British Foreign Office.
--i Sincere regret is expressed in ottlcial cir
cles. The British Government Is still un
able to see its way clear to freeing -the '
hapless woman.
Despite the discouragement attendant
I upon the reiterated declination of Great
; Britain to grant the request of this Gov
j ernment. 11 is the Intention of the admin-
I istration to continue its efforts in Mrs.
Maybrick*s behalf.
When Ambassador Choate was given his
formal instructions In February, just be
fore he left for Great Britain; he was di
rected to leave no stone unturned to ob
tain clemency for Mrs. Maybrlck, and at
J the proper time to make representation
I to the British Government. ,He complied
with his instructions several weeks ago
and the British Foreign Office consented
to look Into the case again. After a rea- ,
sonable time had â  i Bed, during which it |
ie presumed the case was reviewed, the ;
reply was returned, courteously, that
nothing had developed to cause any
change In the conduct of the Government
with respect to the prisoner.
It was told to-day that the friends of
! Mrs. Maybrick in this country, who have -
i not, however, been advised of this latest i
development in her case, are still memo- !
rializlng the State Department and the
British Government in her behalf. The
State Department has just received from '.
a league organized to obtain Mrs. May
brick's release a long statement reciting :
' the facts and pleading that she be re- j
Stored to liberty. This memorial possibly ,
will be officially transmitted to the British |
Government for its information.
In July Mrs. Maybrick will have been !
ten years in prison an a result of the |
sentence imposed upon her in conse
quence I the finding of the jury that she \
was guilty of having administered arsenic

PADEREWSKI AND
MME, GORSKI WED
Great Pianist Joins the
Divorced Woman.
â  . â  .
: Special' Dispatch to The Call.
. NEW YORK. May 29.â special to the
World from Paris says: The World's rep
resentative here learns on unimpeach
able authority that lgnace Paderewski,
the great pianist, was secretly married
last December to Mmc Elena Gorski, the
divorced wife of Ladislas Gorski, the
well-known violinist, formerly a member
of the Lamoureaux Orchestra.
Mme. Gorski, when in Geneva recently,
signed herself "Elena Paderewskl" on the
register of the Casino. Mme. Gorski and
Paderewski are now living quietly in
Paris together, awaiting the Pope's dis
pensation before having an ecclesiastical
marriage. A dispensation, however, is
really needed, as the madame's marriage
to Gorski was Illegal, having been with
out the consent of her parents, as the
Polish law requires. . :
The madame, who is still passing as
Mint-. Gorski in Paris, is 44 years of age
older, therefore, than Paderewski. She
has intensely black hair, Jewish features,
! which look beautiful and ugly by turns,
' and has a remarkable fascination.
Paderewski has been devoted to her from
a time when, years ago, Gorski took care
of Paderewski's invalid son, in the days
of the great musician's poverty and ob
scurity.
In case of an ecclesiastical marriage
Gorski will probably give his wife away,
as was done by Ruskin to Sir John Mil
lais. â

ADVENTISTS ENCAMPED
IN A CITY OF TENTS
STOCKTON, May 28.â All is in readiness for the con- j
vening of ihr* .State conference and camp rrv 'ing of
the Sev< n Day Adventists. The well appointed camp
at (Joodwater Grove was visited Eo-day by hundreds
of persons from this city, who wera surprised at the
size of the white city which has sprung up under the
spreading oaks during the past week.
Three hundred tents are set up on lines of military
precision. There is a main thoroughfare leading to the :
big meeting tent, and from it are numerous streets', all
duly numbered and indicated by directing signs. Even
th tents have their numbers and the inmates will be reg- i
istered, so that any one looking for friends will have no j
trouble in finding them. All of the carivas is bright and ;
clean, and .>n the floor of every tent is burlap, which is !
swept and cleaned daily.
The large tent in which the sessions of the conference
will be held will seat 2000 people. There is another big '
place, which will be known as the restaurant. Here all â¢
the foods which are peculiar to the sect will be served at i
a nominal cost. Most of the families will do their own
cooking, and the camp is provided with every convenience I
for improvised housekeeping.
There was a scene of activity at the camp to-day. Peo- j
pie were beginning to arrive in all kinds of vehicles,
while a few early comers reached the city by train. As to
day was not the Sabbath to the Adventists, but merely the
first of the week, the work of finishing the camp went on
without cessation. Everybody had something to do and
was working as if the success of the coming conference
depended entirely upon him. |

SALT LAKE, Utah, May 2S.â Rear-Ad
miral Schley arrived here from Denver
at 10 o'clock this morning. At Provo,
Utah, he was met by a reception commit
tee headed by Governor Wells and other
State officials. A large and enthusiastic.
crowd greetted the party at the railroad
station. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the
rear-admiral and party attended the ser
vices at the Tabernacle. The regular ser
vices were suspended for special, service
in his honor. After music by the Taber
nacle Choir a short sermon was preached
by Dr. Talmage. At the conclusion of the
services Rear Admiral Schley was es
corted to the pulpit, and after shaking
hands with the church officials made a
short speech. He said in part:
This is the first time in my life that I have
ever been in the interior of this great empire
of ours, and I have abundant proof and reason
now to understand how it Is that we have
grown to such a mighty nation. , .
I believe that the fundamental principle un
derlying that confidence upon which the Repub
lic Is built has been the respect and love for its
women. As we say in our profession, the man
who serves behind the guns best Is the man
who has the best woman serving behind him.
It has been their doings largely which have
made our flag a little bit more beautiful;- that
has made us a little bit more proud of being
Americans.
In the war through which, we have just
passed I think It has been worth all the blood
that has been shed and all the money that has
been spent to have learned our own. power and
to have taught it to other people. Another Im
pressive lesson has been that the lines which
divided us heretofore have all been dissipated,
and in the war just ended the North and the
South, the East and the West, have stood in
that brotherhood : and in , that readiness to die
for the best flag; in the world, supported and
protected by the best people, because they be
lieve In God and God's presence In everything.
In the afternoon the visiting, party was
driven through the principal streets to
the home of George Y. Wallace, whose
guests they will be during their stay in
the city. ____________

STOCKTON, May 28.â Rabbi Farber of
the Jewish synagague occpuied the pulpit
of the First Congregational Church this
evening. His presence drew a represent
ative audience of Hebrew and Christian
people. Hew Dr. Sink, the pastor of
the church, spoke in the synagogue on
Friday evening, and the rabbi this even
ing reciprocated the courtesy.
In introducing the Jewish divine Rev.
Dr. Sink said he counted his frinedship
with the rabbi very highly, and while
they both held tenaciously to their ten
ets they found companionship and profit
in the social relation. The pastor said
he did not see why differences of the
head should affect the relations of the
heart. In the synagogues of old the
teachers of all shades of opinion were
given an opportunity to be heard, and he
was sure the rabbi's, remarks would
work to the edification of all. Jt was with
pleasure that he introduced his friend.
Rabbi Farber said he did not feel that
he w r as working an innovation. Neither
he nor Dr. Sink were seeking to interfere
with one another's work. Churches were
erected to the worship of God and not to
creeds. Jf a man 'entered the sacred pre
cincts with a heart for worship the
thonght of the Great I Am would so
humble him that he would not riuibhle
over smaller differences. Where the mind
contemplated the Infinite Creator there
could be no time for construction of dog
mas. These remarks he made with a view
that all should understand the broad
plane upon which he and his Christian
brother Btood He was Kind of the spirit
and age which made such a fellowship
possible.
The rabbi then delivered an eloquent ad
dress upon "Side Lights From Jewish
History. ' He showed how in many re
spects the ideas of Judaism and Chris
tianity blended. He explained the hopes
of the Jews, their characteristics, nation
al and social, bringing out many points
unfamiliar to any but careful readers Of
history. The address was well received.
Jt was scholarly and in a spirit calculat
ed to win the good will of all.

Prisoner's Crime the Killing of At

Angeles in Revenge for
a Blow.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I.OS ANGELBS, May 28.â The trial of
William H. Alford, charged with the mur
der of Attorney Jay B. Hunter, will begin
to-morrow in the Superior Court, and
probably will be one of the memorable
cases heard in this county. The fact that
Hunter was a southern attorney of abil
ity, prominent in social and business af
fairs and the owner of several mines at
Randsburg has added more than passing
interest to the case.
Alford is a young mechanic, who had
prospered by dint of perseverance and
had borne a good reputation. This was
evidenced when a friend advanced Jlu.'wO
in Government bonds to procure his re
lease on bail.
The killing occurred last February in
the office of Hunter, in the Stimson
block. It was the outgrowth of animos
ity of long standing, arising from business
matters. Hunter was indebted to Alford
under a judgment which Hunter persist
ently refused to pay. When Alford went
to collect the judgment Hunter knocked
him down. Alford then shot and killed the
attorney.
The defense will not deny the killing.
Hunter made a dying statement accus
ing Alford of having murdered him
Around this the legal battle will center
The point that Hunter knocked Alford
down with a cane whose silver head
weighed three pounds will form the back
i of the defense.
Over one hundred witnesses have been
summoned. General Johnstone Jones will
appear for the State, assisted by ex-Sen
ator White, Charles Wellborn and Win
der, Creighton & Davis. Alford will be
defended by Karl Rogers, Hon. Will \
Harris, Frank Flint and Paul Burks For
political reasons a great many hiwyers

PARIS, May 28.â 1n the race for the
Grand Prix of the French Jockey Club
to-day at Long Champs, Perth won, with
Vetatsqvez second and Holoeauste third.
LONDON, May 2:'.â The failure of Holo
causte to secure a ;>laee bettor than third
in the French derby yesterday sent up
Flying Fox stock in London this evening.
Tod Sloan, the Ainertc&n Jockey, who
some time ago hoped to secure Holocauste
as his mount for the English derby, said
this evening to the correspondent of the
Associated Press:
"I am much disappointed at the tauure
of Hnloeauste to secure a better place.
The Paris performances convinced me
that Flying Fox now has a million
chances to one of success next Wednes
day. 1 have felt for a long time that if I
could not secure a chance to win the Der
by this year I would prefer standing on
the ground to watch the race. Therefore
I have refused to ride My Boy, the own
ers of which have pressed me to make an
effort.
"I am now negotiating for a mount,
which is not yet decided, but which I
shall announce to-morrow or Tuesday,
and which, if successful, will be a com
plete surprise. I should have to he conn
dent of winning a place or I would not
think of making the trial.
"The fact that I have had a series of
losses recently in no wise affects my npir
its. All this is the fortune of the turf. I
do not know of any race I ha% r e lost that
I can look back on now and think I could
have won. My mounts, perhaps, have
been just as good as they were last year,
nor has there been any particular mishap
in the races that would lead me to think
that they were lost for any reason except
that my opponents had better v horses. In
the race for the Manchester â¢â cup, the
track conditions were -undoubtedly favor
able to Asierie, but she is in anything but
the best form.
"All talk about my being discouraged
or dissatisfied or disposed to return to
America is untrue, as are the alleged re
ports of my talk with the Prince of
Wales, which have only been printed in
the hope thut they would injure me by
being reproduced in the English papers.
"When I was disqualified at Epsom. I
knew I could not control the horae and
this rendered the result imperative. Lord
Durham told me he had not heard a clear
er or more explicit account of the race
than I gave him. Neither I nor my
American backers have ever complained
of the decision. In fact, I am quite as
well satisfied with events here as ever,
and I am confident that the end of the
season will show a good average for me."

WATERLOO, lowa, May 28.â The
/ trough train from Chicago- to Minne- \
polls over the Rock Island and
Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern
railways was wrecked at 1:15 o'clock
this morning at the . crossing of Sink j
Creek, about four miles southeast of
this place. The train consisted of five
coaches, including mail and baggage
cars, smoking car, two passenger
coaches and a sleeper. Nine persons ,
were killed and twenty-three injured.
The list of dead is as follows:

A cloudburst had washed the sand
and gra\ - el [bed, leaving the track
unsupported for a stretch of twenty
feet. The rails and ties held together
and there was nothing to indicate the
insecurity i-i the road. The engine
struck the washout and was derailed
in the ditch beside the track and be
hind It the cars were piled in a con- j
fused heap. The mail car toppled over
and was telescoped by the baggage be- '
hind, while the rear end of the baggage
car in turn telescoped the smoker.
The roof of the sleeper plowed its way
through the day coach, while the lower
half of the latter crushed thrc-ugh the
sleeper.
The engineer and fireman jumped
from the train and escaped with slight
4 injuries. Mr. Schwette of Alton, 111.,
" was brought to this city alive, but died
at 8 o'clock. He was badly cut about
the head, and it was evident from the
beginning that his injuries were fatal.
He was on his way to Minneapolis, i
where he was to be married to-day.
He asked his physician to telegraph his
father and his sweetheart. "Tell her,"
he gasped, "that I- have been detained
by a wreck and cannot keep the ap- j
pointment on time. Don't say any
more."
The news was brought to this city
by a mail clerk, the fire whistle was
blown, a switch engine and coach
hastily prepared and a relief train sent
very speedily. The injured passengers
were extricated from the debris and
brought here. Another relief train soon
arrived from Cedar Rapids and lock a !
number of the seriously injured to be
treated in the hospital in that city.
F. J. Day of Allison, lowa, a pas
senger, said: "The train was running
along at a good speed, and at a point
about three or four miles from Water
loo it left the track. The engine and j
baggage car were thrown about ten i
feet. The engineer evidently .had his !
engine under excellent control; as I
never saw such s a sudden stop. The
smoker, where I sat, telescoped the
baggage "car, and I found myself with
the brakeman on the roof of the day
coach."
Will Schollian of Waterloo, who
travels for a St. Louis tobacco house
and makes his headquarters in this j
city, suffered more severely than any i
other of the Waterloo passengers'. He j
was found in the second passenger j
coach, to which he had gone after leav- j
king the smoker, his arm crushed be- i
tween the front end of the sleeper and !
the side of the car holding him fast In
the wreck. He did not lose conscious
ness, but begged that his arm be sawed
off, so as to set him free. When it was
found that there was no possibilty of |
saving the arm, this was done, the am- i
putation being effected by a common j
hand saw. Mr.- Schollian displayed the
utmost fortitude, and after he was re
leased walked to the adjoining farm
house of Mrs. Caroline' Mericle, where
he subsequently died.
Mr. Day, in speaking of the cause of
the accident, said: "There must have
been a waterspout, for a powerful
stream of water washed the dirt out
from under the track for a distance, I
should think, of half a mile. With the
foundation gone there was nothing to
hold up the rails, and as the weight of
the train struck the weak spot, down
and over we went."

FATHER YORKE
RECEIVED BY
HIS HOLINESS
Incidents of the Audience
Granted the Popular Priest
of San Francisco.
POPE ON JOURNALISM
V
Greatly Interested in the Work in
Behalf of the Catholic Churoh
in America.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 28.â Private ad
vices from Rome state that on May 4
the Pope granted a special and private
audience to Father Yorke of San Fran
cisco. When the Pope received him in
his private room, and, after welcoming
him, took his hand in a fond clasp and
held it so during the entire audience,
he was consoling and rewarding Catho
lic journalism in the United States. "'ln
decorating you I decorate the whole
order," said President Carnot, as he
pinned a medal on the breast of a nurs
ing sister, and in so exceptionally hon
oring Father Yorke the Pope honored
all Catholic journalists of the United
States.
"What can I do for you?" said the
Pope, fondling the hand of Father
Yorke.
"Bless me, Holy Father; bless my â¢
my .mother, my family and
'friends. "
"Then you are a journalist?"
"Yes, Holy Father, I did what I could
for the defense of the church and the
rights of the sovereign pontiff."
The Pope put inquiries which showed
his close and warm appreciation of the
work of Father Yorke on the Pacific
coast, and elicited the answer: "Yes,
1 spoke to an audience of fifty thou
sand." The Pope threw up his hands,
having loosened hold of the priest's
hand for the first and only time during
the audience.
"You must wield an immense influ
ence," said the Pope, as he marveled
at the large audience of one Catholic
journalist. He proceeded to enlarge
upon the power of the Catholic press.
This done, he said to Father Yorke,
"Are there many Protestant newspa
pers in California?"
"No, Holy Father, the newspapers
are for the greater part merely secular
and neutral. There are only a few
Protestant papers, weekly ones. Dog
matic Protestantism is not strong in
California."
"How did the Catholics help your
work?"
"They helped with great devotion.
Holy Father, and 1 may take the op
portunity of saying that there are no
more loyal children of the see of Peter
than the Catholics of America."
"How are the Protestants disposed
toward the church?"
"Holy Father,, all love the Pope of
great encyclicals."
' When you reach home." -said Leo,
"bless your friends and helpers in my
name. Tell them that the Holy Father
is deeply interested in your work and
that he showed great interest in it
when he spoke to you and that he en
couraged you with all his heart. More
than that, tell them that he encouraged
you and with you all those who helped
you and forwarded your great work,
and that in giving' his paternal bless
ing to you he sent it also through you
to each and all of them. Tell them
this, all this. Be sure you tell them
this, that the Pope blessed you and
blessed them also."
Father Yorke then excused himself
and received the formal act of bless
ing. During the audience the Pope had
to sit motionless. He had displayed no
emotion in his body except at the men
tion of the audience of fifty thousand,
when, impressed with the immensity of
this influence for good, he gesticulated
with his hands and arms, throwing
them up in the air and wide apart.
His health seemed to have in no way
changed for the worse since his illness,
and he gave the impression of a non
agenenian with a length of life in
promise before him.
The advices state that Father Yorke
intends to make a visit to England, re
maining three weeks. He will then
spend three months in Ireland before
setting out for the United States.
There he will do about a fortnight's
I traveling before reaching San Francis
; co in October.
WARDNER STRIKE COSTS
MORE THAN A MILLION
The Miners Themselves and the Gov-
eminent Bear a Large Part of
the Expenses.
BOISE, Idaho, May 28.â to the pres
ent lime the cost of the Wardher riot has
reached the enormous total of $775,000, ajid
the expenses have just commenced. The
most Important item, of course, was the
value of the Bunker Hill plant, worth
$250,000, which the dynamiters destroyed.
Next to that comes the charge of $200,000
loss to the employes of railway and
smelter companies through the shutting
down of ore production of the Coeur
d'Alenes because of the riots. The miners
themselves,- deprived of work through the
shutting down, have lost altogether $175,-
MOO in wages otherwise earned. .
The expense borne by the general gov
ernment in bringing troops hither is es
timated by the military authorities at
$00,000. "The expenses borne thus far by
the State alone have reached over $30,000.
To defend the union miners under arrest
the Western Federation of Miners has
collected a fund of $10,000. and it Is un
derstood to be on the verge of raising
$00 000 more. Immense as are the expenses
already accrued, they will be added to
immensely by : the costs of the coming
trial and the maintenance of martial law,
at it will be impossible at best 1 to repair
the loss for anything like $1,000,000.
NEW YORK. Ma" 28.â Central Fed

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 29, 1899.
FILIPINOS RETURN TO
THEIR OLD TRENCHES
Town of Jolo, Capital of t\)e Sulu fJrchipelago, Over Which tbe
American Flag Was Hoisted on the 21st Inst.
The Sulu Archipelago is the most southern of the whole Philippine group, form
ing the connecting chain between Mindinao and Borneo. It consists of
about 150 islands, with about 100,000 inhafe tants, who are Mohammedans,
and were ruled by a Sultanate until 1878, when they were annexed by Spain.
MANILA. May 28, 8 p. m.â The
approach of the wet season
finds the insurrection seeming
ly taking a new lease of life.
All along the American lines
the rebels are showing more aggressive
activity in their guerrilla style than at
any time before or since the fall of
Malolos. They keep the United States
troops in the trenches, sleeping in their
clothing, and constantly on the alert
against dashes on our outposts, and
then make life warm for the American
garrisons in the towns.
The bands of General Luna and Gen
eral Mascardo, which retreated toward
Tarlac when they feared they would be
caught between General McArthur and
General Lawton, have returned in force
to their old trenches around San Fer
nando, where there are daily collisions.
Opposite our lines on the south, pro
tecting Manila, all the way around to
San Pedro Macati, the Filipinos have
three rows of trenches most of the dis
tance.
Reports from prisoners indicate that
the insurgents construe the peace ne
gotiations to mean that the Americans
have enough of the fighting. The Fili
pinos are encouraged by the belief that
the Americans are preparing for an in
terval of inactivity during the wet sea
son. This period is sure to be followed
by much suffering. Thousands of
acres of land that were under cultiva
tion last year have not been plowed
this year, and the Government will
probably be obliged to feed thousands,
just as it fed the Cubans. Friendly
natives, amigos, continue to pour into
the American lines by land and river
routes, coming from the territory of
the insurrection into the country where
the passage of the two armies has left
no food, and practically throwing
themselves upon the charity of their
conquerors. Such able-bodied men as
are not in the Filipinos' ranks have
been kept by the insurgent leaders to
dig the trenches, and the old men,
women and children form the mass of
the refugees. These are doing some
plowing, but they will be confronted by
hunger before they can realize any
subsistence from their crops. The
United States army has organized a
system of distributing rice at Malolos
and some of the smaller towns where
Filipino stores were captured, but the
latter will soon be exhausted.
The United States transport Morgan
City, which arrived he.re from San

Grows Brighter.
TUB HAGUE, May US.â The newly ap

known as the drafting committee, indi

ceasingly to-day, although the formal
labors of the conference were suspended.
An effort Is being made, and with a cer

Russian and British proposals in such a
way that the report of the drafting com
mittee may secure the support of both
parties in the plenary committee. M. de

conference to-day with this end in view,
and there Is no doubt that an agreement
in principle will be reached.
The hopes of the delegates that a per

points' now relate to the composition of
the tribunal, how the representation of
the powers is to be arranged and the
limitations to be placed upon the juris

The American troops give the Filipino
dead a decent burial, and provide every

GENERAL HALE PRAISES
THE VALOR OF TROOPS
WASHINGTON, May 28.â Tne War
Department has made public a report
from General Irving Hale, who com
manded the Second Brigade, Second
Division of the Eighth Army Corps at
Manila upon the stirring events be
tween the nights of February 4 and 9
there. This division was quartered in
the Vicinity of the water works and a
portion of it, the Nebraska Regiment,
fired the first shots that began the ac
tive fighting with the insurgents.
General Hale tells the story of the
operations of his command with great
precision and military minuteness. He
says he received his first information of
the outbreak along the front of the Ne
braska Regiment through the lucky
hearing by one of his operators of a
part of a telegram dispatch that was
passing over the wires . from Colonel
Stotzenberg to division headquarters.
His account of the beginning of the
difficulty with the insurgents agreed In
every respect with the stories of Colonel
Stotzenberg and General Mac Arthur,
and he adds that his own troops did not
begin firing until the . insurgent firing
had been going on for some time.
The first opportunity the United
States troops had to test the real
quality of the insurgents appears to
have been at the attacks at the block
tion of the Geneva convention provisions
regarding sick and wounded neutrals
constitutes a distinct success for the
American delegates. When it was first
broached, the Russians declined to take
any part in the discussion, on the ground
that the subject was not mentioned in
the circular of Count Muravieff. The
Americans urged that the Dutch invita
tion included all subjects bearing on the
circular, a view which the conference up
held. The Russians as yet have not aban
doned their position, and they will make
another effort to-morrow to have the
American proposals rejected on technical
grounds. Interesting developments are
expected.
WRECK OF THE JESSIE
TO BE INVESTIGATED
Government Will Learn Whether
Passengers and Crew Were Slain
by Indians.
PORT TOWNSEND, May 28.â The Gov
ernment will, it is said, investigate the
wreck of the steamer Jessie, which oc
curred last summer near the mouth of
the Kuskokwin River, Alaska, with a loss
of sixteen lives. One of the cutters form
ing the Boring Sea patrol, which leaves
for the north in a few days, has been or
dered to stop at the mouth of the Kus
kokwin and make inquiries. News of the
wreck of the Jessie was first published
last August. Later it was reported li.>r
passengers and crew had been murdered
by Indians after reaching shore. The
Swedish missionaries stationed at the
houses near Sampoloo Cemetery. Here,
says General Hale, the First Colorado
Regiment made a charge in fine style,
rushing and halting alternately in case
the enemy's fire became too strong.
When half way to the block houses the
insurgents broke from fhe east works
bushes and houses in surprising num
bers and ran for the hills, the Ameri
cans picking them off as they ran.
Thirty-five were gathered up in the im
mediate vicinity, twenty-four dead and
eleven wounded. This movement broke
the insurgent center and showed that
they could not stand a charge. There
fore, the tactics were repeated and
other charges were made by other regi
ments of the command with like gal
lantry and success, the Tennessee and
South Dakota troops being commended
among others.
General Hale speaks in one portion of
the report of finding the body of As
sistant Surgeon Young of the Utah
| Battery with a powder-stained bullet
l hole in his head, indicating that he had
been captured and killed after his cap
tore.
The successful campaign against
Mariquina, to protect the water works,
is set out in detail and an explanation
is afforded of what all the time ap
peared to have been a check experi
enced by the advancing American
forces. General Hale tells how his
troops had been excellently placed and
stopped the advance because of the ap
proach of darkness, this deciding them
to remain where they were until morn
ing. General Hale then says:
Lieutenant /A. P.Hayne. California Heavy
Artillery, who had voluntarily accom
panied Major Goodale as aide, expressing
I a desire to return to the city, was al
lowed tn do so and on his arrival went
tc the department commander with a
grossly exaggerated report of the situa
tion, on the strength of which the de
partment commander directed the with
drawal of the battalion. Captain Krayen
liuhl and Lieutenant Terry of the brigade
staff, with a platoon of Oregon troops as
escort, and carrying two canteens of
water per man. with a larger supply on a
cart, were therefore dispatched to the re-
I lief of the Twenty-third battalion. An
i orderly was sent to the water works to
i notify Colonel Stoten'oerger of the with
drawal of this covering forco on his left,
so that he could take other means for pro
tection. It was found that the report was
practically groundless; that tht^ position
was a strong one; that there was no fir
ing and no apparent danger, and that Ma
jor Goodale was reluctant to withdraw,
â¢ specially at night. They therefore left
the platoon there and returned. Lieuten

partment commander, who authorized me
to leave the battalion where it was and

The Kuskokwin Indians have given a
straightforward account of the wreck of

going in their canoes to the rescue of the
passengers. They secured a large amount
of wreckage from the barge which the
Jessie was towing. Other Indians who
trade along the coast knew of the wreck,
but none of them believed that any of
passengers reached shore, as the breakers
at the mouth of the river run very high
find there is a strong undertow.
CAPTAIN THOMAS MEIN ILL.
I San Francisco Mining Man an In-

TACOMA, May 28.â Captain Thomas
MHn, a mining man of San Francisco,
lies critically ill with lung trouble in a
hospital at Victoria. He has been in
Alaska looking after his interests in the
Silver Bow Basin and inspecting the
works of the new stamp mill at the
Treadwell mine, of which he was the con

taken ill, and decided to return home. He
boarded the steamer City of Topeka,
which arrived yesterday, but became
worse on the trip down. He had a num

had his own physician not been with him.
He was critically ill when taken off the

SUCCESSFUL
JUMP FROM
THE BRIDGE
Passengers on an Electric
Car View a Thrilling
Spectacle.
KIEIZ'S DARING FEAT
Demonstrates What a Man Can
Safely Do Without Injury by
Exercising Will Power.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 28.â Howard
Kretz, a young man about 22 years of
age, who says he is an art student of
the Academy of Design of this city,
made a startling and successful jump
from the Brooklyn Bridge just before
dusk this evening, and came out of the
river uninjured.
Just before 6 o'clcrck Kretz boarded a
trolley car bound for Brooklyn. It was
an open one and afforded all the ad
vantages which he was looking for.
When the trolley reached a point about
100 yards from the first arch, near the
highest point of the span, Kretz leaped
from the car, and like a flash vaulted
over the high railing. He took no time
to steady himself for a perpendicular
drop, and swung some distance from
the structure before he assumed an
upright position. The passengers
jumped from the car and peered
through the railing, while hundreds of
persons on the promenade tried to get
a glimpse of the figure. Kretz's body
flashed through the air almost in a per
pendicular streak. He struck the water
feet first, cleaving it like an arrow. He
disappeared for some seconds and then
shot up in view, only to disappear for
the second time. The waters had hardly
closed over him when he reappeared
and immediately struck out strongly
for the New York shore.
One of the deckhands on the steamer
Vulcan, which was coming down East
River at the same time, saw Kretz
flash through the air and disappear in
the water. The deckhand gave the
alarm and the Vulcan was headed for
the young man, who by this time was
swimming. A line was thrown to
Kretz and he was hauled aboard the
Vulcan, which immediately put for her
dock on the New York side.
When taken on the Vulcan Kretz
placed his hands on his abdomen as if
in pain, but when the boat reached her
dock Kretz sprang from the boat onto
the wharf. He was at once taken into
custody and hurried to the Hudson
street Hospital. Not the slightest in
jury was found on his person, but he
was suffering from shock. He was de
tained on the charge of attempting sui
cide.
Kretz is about five feet eight inches
tall and weighs about 140 pounds. He
lives in this city. He said he had been
reading a book on theosophy, and that
he wanted to demonstrate that a man,
by exercising his will power,' could do
anything he wished without injury to
himself.
PASSENGER TRAIN WRECKED
AND A PORTER KILLED
. OELWEIN, lowa. May 28.â The Chicago
Great Western passenger train that left
St. Paul Saturday night was wrecked two
miles north of here this morning. Richard
Manning of Minneapolis, the colored por
ter, was killed. Several men and women
on the train were more or less seriously
injured. The train was running over the
lowlands when the track began to settle,
and the train was derailed. _
Nearly all of the passengers in the
sleepers were undressed in their berths
when the wreck occurred. The rain was
coming down furiously, lightning was
flashing and thunder pealing. The porter
was crushed to death at the forward end
of the first sleeper.
E. W. Scribner of Boston, who occupied
a compartment in one of the Pullman
sleepers, said: ''I was waked by a loud
crash and a lurch. Then I felt the coach
I was in slide over to one side. I dressed
as fast as possible but was unable to
opcta the door of my stateroom, so I got
out of the window. Several men were res
cued in their night clothes."
The passengers were brought to Oel
weln and well cared for, most of them
taking the first train out. The entire train
and the locomotive are almost a total loss.
The train was an elegant one and the
damage to the railway company will be
heavy.

ROLLS OF
THE CUBANS
INACCURATE
There Has Been Considerable
Stuffing in Order to Cheat
Uncle Sam.
SOME SUES OMITTED
Out of 111 Applicants Yesterday
for Money Only 30 Receive
a Share.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May 28.â Thera were 11*
applications to-day for sharrs in the
$3,000,000 which the United States has
offered as a gratuity to the Cuban
troops. Thirty were given $75 each.
The others were not on the rolls, al
though they had guns which they were
ready to turn in, and certificates of
service.
The United States military authori
ties consider that the rolls are very un
reliable. Indeed, the opinion is freely
expressed that a large proportion of
the names are fictitious and that the
rolls omit a majority of the names uf
those rightly entitled to share in the
gratuity. The object of this, apparent
ly, is to discredit the proceedings and
to show the Cuban public that a large
number of the troops refused to take
American money.
Lieutenant Colonel George M. Ran
dall of the Eighth United States Infan
try, the commissioner superintending
the distribution here, went carefully
over the rolls of one battalion with its
commandant. He pointed out thirty
four names of men who are dead and
names "of others who had not been
heard of outside the rolls.
Of those paid to-day, twenty-five
turned in arms â Mausers, Remingtons
and carbines. The other five showed
receipts from the Alcalde vouching for
the delivery of their arms. The pay
ment will continue until noon to-mor
row in Havana city, but Colonel Ran
dall says it will be necessary to have
additional days after a While here and
extra pay rolls for men who have un
doubtedly seen service. He also be
! lieves that were thfc payment to be con
tinued for the next three months at
least 90 per cent of those entitled to
apply would do so. Most of those who
received shares to-day asserted that
they only heard by accident that the
distribution was now actually taking
place.
Colonel Randall will send to Senor
Perfecto La Coste, the Mayor, all the
arms turned in to-day. The first pay
ment outside of Havana will be made
on Tuesday at Santiago de Las Vegas,
whither Colonel Randall, the clerkÂ« "id
thirty soldiers will go with the pay
master.

AUCTION SALES.
By Frank W. Butterfleldâ This day at 11 a. m. at 408 Van
Ness aye.. Furniture.
THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S YEAR.
THESE are tranquil times in trade. There is no
unt anywhere. All lines of business se< m
to be in Rood shape, and as there is no undue
speculation the commercial current is about as smooth
as it ever gets. From the East come the regular and
now stereotyped reports of larger bank clearings,
smaller failures, a booming in m market, increased
activity in wool, and- so on. These weekly reports oi
continued, prosperity are becoming monotonous, and
'trade reports of late are. simply repetitions, in phrase
. ofogy changed to give them an air of newness.
The extraordinary activity in iron and steel has be
come so old that the subject is threadbare, and re
peated advancer in quotations excite little comment.
The flurry in wool if of recent date and is. therefore,
more interesting. The sales at the three chief markets
for three weeks foot up nearly .^1.000.000 pounds and
are mainly due to speculators, as the manufacturers
are doing very little buying. They will probably have
to come to it. however, as the speculators are getting
the market into their own hands and are determined
that if tli. manufacturers buy they will have to pay
them their profit The cotton mills are d^in^r a good
business, even at the higher quotations, and are put
â¢ ; out large quantities < Lumber continues
firm and activ Ing operations continue lively.
Bootr. and shoes hold the recent advances without
dimculty. and hides and leather are firm in sympathy.
But the â  â  as its drawbacks. The wholesale
distribution is slack at the moment, chiefly on account
of the cold and backward spring, which checks retail
trade. Then the winter wheat crop has been falling
ort seriously of late, and even conservative parties in
the trade now admit that the yield will fall 100.000.000
bushels under the estimates of a month ago. The Feb
ruary freeze began the work, which has been con
tinued by the Hessian fly and cold and unfavorable
â¢r<mi>ts predict a complete failure of the
winter sown grain. The export trade, too, has lately
shown a decided decrease, both in food supplies and
manufactured goods. In spite of these drawbacks,
however, the bank clearings of the country last week
were 58 per cent larger than for the same week in 1898,
and all of the more important cities showed a gain.
The failures were 142 against 245 last year.
It is gratifying to note that California is making as
good a showing as any other State, as the grain crop
is in fine condition as a rule.- and the fruit interests
are in high feather. Reverse conditions prevail in
Oregon and Washington, where the climatic condi
tions are the same as in the East, with the same re
sults. The Government section directors for both â¢
State- report a very cold and backward season, with
a poor outlook for grain and a serious deficiency in
almost all fruits. This is evidently California's year, j
When a single car of cherrie- and apricot- sold in
New York nets the California orchardists $4000 times
may be said to be good among the fruit-growers, and
this is the record of a single car last week. Advices
from New York report the demand for California
canned fruits as immense, with smaller supplies than
for ten years. an(J some California canners have al
ready sold all the fruit they can possibly pack, and
this before, the fruit 1- anywhere near ripe. Of course
there is a general skurrying about the State for sup
plies, and the high prices fur fruit quoted in this
column last week still rule, with no signs of a decline.
Enthusiasts predict that California fruit will sell high
for the next five years owing to the widespread de
-1 struction of trees throughout the East by the Feb
, ruary freeze, but this is a pretty sweeping prediction.
Other local staples are equally prosperous. Wool
has been remarkably active of late, hides and leather
have been in steady demand at firm prices, provisions
show no decrease in activity, cattle, sheep and hogs
continue to bring stiff quotations, and so on down the
commercial list. Unless all signs fail, a good many
farm mortgages will be paid off in California this year.
General Gomez intends to visit President Me Kin
ley. It is a safe wager that the Cuban general will
not discuss the Santiago campaign. He dare not tell
what he did not do. and it would be equally embar
rassing for him to tell what he did.
Â«
It is reported that Captain Watkins of the steam
ship Paris said that he could not understand how the
. accident to the ship happened. Perhaps the fact that
the vessel is on the Manacles Rocks may shed some
light on the subject.
The Filipinos want to make terms for an uncon
ditional surrender. When they understand the lan
guage better they may learn that "unconditional" is
a word that has no modifiers.
With $25,000 in hand as a nest egg to start with, the
Dewey Monument Committee would be justified in
beginning to count its chickens.
THE STREET RAILWAY STEAL.
THERE are three principal daily newspapers pub- j
lished in San Francisco. Upon a great many j
questions they arc '^dissevered, discordant, bel
ligerent." And yet on the Market Street Railway
steal, which the Board of Supervisors, elected by a
preponderance of votes in the entire municipality, is

i mous. What does this mean? â  It means an over- i
whelming preponderance of public sentiment against
I the outrage, a preponderance of the men who own the
property and pay the taxes in San Francisco.
In 1851 and in succeeding years the Common Coun
: cil of this city was corrupt and was owned by rotten
i politicians. In 1856 the Board of Supervisors, estab
! lished by the Consolidation Act, was indescribably
: purchasable and low. But in 1899 all previous experi
j ence has hem transcended. The railroad Supervisors,
j one and all, belong to a pachydermatous breed. Their
skins arc so thick that if they were thrown into a den
of lioi ilazing furnace their moral sensibilities;
would remain torpid. They arc the nearest approach j
that has yet been discovered to absolute impervious- I
ness. They are encrusted with the railroad cuticle and j
are proud of the branded covering that encases them !
with degradation.
It has been demonstrated that no Supervisor can
vote for the tangled mass of franchises and privileges,
â  unintelligible except to the initiated, that seven Super
-1 visors have been ordered to turn over to the monopo
; ly. without confessed dishonesty. And this fact is in
I no way affected by the parade on Friday last before
â  the Street Committee of property owners who justly
desire increased railway facilities in the southeastern |
part of this metropolis. Some of these gentlemen be- j
long to the living statuary that Mr. Huntington occa- |
sionally uses to produce an impression of popular
sentiment that has no real existence. But their de
mands are nevertheless legitimate and in due time and |
in the right way ought to be met. It does not
follow that, while asking for the relief to which they
are entitled, they mean that, under the guise of pro- 1
moting a necessary public improvement, the residuary
interests of the municipality in its streets and in the
easements necessarily employed in transportation j
lid be gratuitously delivered to Mr. Huntington.
But, notwithstanding the fact, generally appreciated
and which has excited the community almost to fren- j
7y. that seven of the existing Supervisors constitute a \
Board of Registration for railroad decrees, the Mayor
and the five honest municipal representatives are not
helpless. Time is the essence of this nefarious business,
land law, which even railroad audacity cannot disregard,
. favors the public interest. It has been vituperatively
I declared by the blatant advocates of this monstrous
iniquity that the law prohibiting the granting of street
railway franchises or privileges within 90 days of a
general election has been repealed. This statement is
false. The act of February .24. 1893, which not only :
cover.- tin- point but also prevents the transfer of
those privileges and franchises for seventy days after
an election is an independent statute which does not
conflict with any other legislation and, therefore, is of
binding force.
It is of course the duty of the City and County At
torney to advise the Board of Supervisors of the ex
isting law. If he is consulted he will probably tell the'!
indurated seven, who unfortunately in one respect do
not represent the united seven of Wordsworth's poem,
that they cannot confer a railroad franchise or privi- 'â 
without the concurrence of the Mayor or without
nine vote- to override his veto. Section 68 of the
Consolidation Act enacts that every ordinance or reso
lution providing for "the granting of afjy privilege" or
involving "the- appropriation of public property," which
covers .ill the applications of the Market Street Railway
Company, "shall, before it takes effect, be presented"
to the Mayor for approval, and the act of March 30,
IS6B, compels nine Supervisors to unite before a veto
can be defeated. In the garbage crematory suit be
i fore Judge Morrow he heM provisionally that, under
the act of March 3, 1893, the signature of the Mayor to \
an order or resolution granting a franchise or privi- i
lege was not required. Under that law. clearly dis
tinguishable from the act of March 13, 1897, the
] Board, after advertisement, was compelled to make an
award to the highest bidder. But, in the first place,
the attention of that distinguished jurist most likely
| had not been directed to a decision of the Supreme!
Court of this State, mentioned in this article, that will
furnish a controlling rule for a Federal tribunal: in J
the second place, the act of iSqj applies to conditions 1
upon which exclusive franchises or privileges can be
granted, and not merely to the method of procedure;
and in the third place, the act of March 13, 1897, with
draws the compulsory requirements of the earlier kiw
and authorizes the rejection of all bids. Its language j
! on this subject, establishing a discretion in which the !
Mayor must be recognized, is very precise: "Pro- !
vided further, that the governing power may reject
any or all bids." And again, that "in the discretion of !
such Board or governing or other legislative body, all :
bids may be set aside and rejected." And section 2of \
j that act, in directing that, upon proper application, the
Attorney General shall institute proceedings to forfeit
unused franchises, includes the Mayor as a "governing
power."
Authority fully confirms the view The Call has sug
gested of the right of the Mayor to pass upon such
orders and resolutions as are before the Board of Su- j
pervisors to-day. In the case of the County of San j
Diego versus Siefert, published in 97 California Re- j
ports, page 599, the Supreme Court confirmed the
proposition of Judge Field, which had acquired the I
f"rce of an axiom, that, in respect to municipal gov- I
ernments. the mode of legislation was the measure of j
the power. In the case of Jacobs versus the Board of Su
pervisors, 100 California Reports, pages 125-128, it was
held that, in fixing water rates, the signature of the
Mayor was unnecessary. This decision has been wide
ly misinterpreted. It was based entirely upon the fact
that, as to this kind of quasi-judicial legislation the j
State Constitution conferred the authority exclusively |
upon the Board. The court said: "But the power in j
question here comes not from the Consolidation Act,
! but from the Constitution of the State," and the opin
j ion of Mr. Justice Harrison, in which he concurs with
the prevailing opinion, written by Mr. Justice Mc-
Farland, definitely indicates the distinction between
the case before the court and an order or resolution
"granting any privilege." And in a suit which seems j
to have escaped general attention, the Supreme Court
'defined and limited the water rate decision and held j
specifically that an order or a resolution granting a i
street railway franchise or privilege is subject to the
Mayor's veto. This was a suit brought by the plain
tiff, Eisenhuth. against Ackerson, the Street Superin
tendent, and is reported in volume 105 of the Califor
nia Reports, at pages 89-95. It quotes section 68 of â¢
the Consolidation Act. and, although it was decided in !
1893 without reference to the statute of that year, and j
four years before the act of 1897 was passed, it covers
the point exactly and has not been subsequently in
validated.
Unless, therefore, there is some other undisclosed i
law that avoids the ruling of the highest tribunal in !
California, the veto of the Mayor can defeat the pre- \
| determined rascality of to-day. But there are other '
I safeguards to be pointed out. The mere fact that the j
I new charter has been adopted by popular vote and j
THE SAX FRANCTSCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 29, 1899.
ratified by the Legislature and that, with its reduction j
of the duration of street railway franchises to twenty- j
j five, years and its augmented percentages and other
I stringent litnitations on street railway exactions, it will
take effect within seven months, demonstrates the in
famy of the Supervisors who propose to donate the j
property of the city to the monopoly, with no reserva
! tion of any percentage for five years. However, so far
i as we are advised, it is evident that in this corrupt pro
ceeding one of the clauses of the act of 1897, has been
studiously concealed. That statute declares that "no
percentage shall be paid. for the first five years suc
ceeding the date of the franchise." that is, as originally |
granted, but' it also enacts that the Board of Supervis- |
ors "may provide as a condition of such franchise that j
the payments of said percentage shall begin at any
time less than five years after the franchise is granted, !
if such franchise is a renewal, or substantially a re- j
newal, of a franchise already in existence." It thus 1
appears that, in respect to the Geary-street renewal,
the seven railroad agents in the board are designing
â  to give away the rights of the public both under the j
: old law and the new charter. Such treachery and vil
, lainy are almost inconceivable.
It has been denied that there is a string to the prof
's fered surrender of the' four years' residue of the exist
ing Geary-street franchise. But the Market Street
Railway Company only makes that tender on condi
tion that the new franchise be granted and section 2 of
the act of March 13. 1897, exacts as a condition pre
cedent to renewal that the existing franchise "shall
be first surrendered by the holders thereof."
It is clear, therefore, that Mayor Phelan and the
five decent members of the Board of Supervisors are
! not without weapons that may be used efficaciously for
j defense. There remains also the opportunity on
I which it is impossible here to amplify, for reconsider
ation of any action that the bare majority of the Board
may seek to perfect at one session. The Board of Su
| pervisor*. under its own rules, is governed by parlia
; mentary law. and the motion to reconsider, made after
the dissolute seven have registered their own degrada
tion by some gentleman who changes his vote for that
purpose, will either carry the scheme over to the next
' regular meeting or afford a fair opportunity to invali
date the fraud. The Clerk is bound to register the j
J motion and the Mayor to hold that no bulldozing ,
I tactics can dispose of it out of the regular order.
It is to be hoped that the delegations chosen by the
I impressive public meetings that have been held may
' convince the unspeakable seven that they are sur- j
rounded. by the magnetic influence of indignant con
stituents, who will not silently defer to their contuma
cious audacity but will assert the sovereignty and the |
) integrity of the American people.
THE DEWEY STATUE FUND.
DURING the present week, and probably begin
ning to-day, the task of gathering contributions
for the Dewey statue fund will go briskly for
>vard. The observance of Memorial day will, of course,
suspend the work for a time, but the patriotic mem
ories of the day so far from interfering with the move
ment will augment its force by reviving in the public
mind and heart those sentiments and feelings of loy
alty and love for the heroic brave, to which the pur
pose of erecting a monument in commemoration of
the victory at Manila directly appeals.
The committee in charge of the enterprise begins
the canvass for contributions with $25,000 subscribed
on the first day. That js one-fourth of the entire
amount at which the cost of .the monument is esti
mated. Such a sum subscribed at once is a virtual
guarantee oi the success of the movement. It is an
assurance to the public that the promoters of the en
terprise are in earnest and that they are willing to
give freely of their money as well as their time and
their energy to bring it to a speedy and triumphant
conclu
Several efforts which have been undertaken to raise
money in this city for monuments have- thus far failed
and remain hardly more than subjects of talk and dis
cussion. For that reason some persons have doubted
whether the present movement would be successful.
The splendid subscriptions of Friday prove all such
doubts to be unfounded. A man need not be a very
sanguine optimist or a very ardent patriot to have
faith now in the enterprise. The erection of the
monument is about as certain as anything in the future
can Vie. and every citizen can contribute to it in pro
portion to his means with full confidence that the
work of erecting the monument is not to be postponed
to some indefinite date in the dim future, but will be
under way before popular interest in the matter either
fades or flags.
It will be remembered that for years before any
thing was accomplished there was talk of constructing
a competing railway down the San Joaquin Valley.
Such a road was in every way desirable and promised
to be profitable, but for a long time no one could be
induced to undertake it. At last Mr. Claus Spreckels
came forward, assumed leadership and responsibility
in the enterprise, subscribed for a large amount of
stock, and at once the construction of the road was
assured. As a matter of fact, it was undertaken and
pushed forward with an energy and rapidity almost
unparalleled in the history of railway construction.
Something of a similar nature will be seen in the
work of raising what will be the most notable monu
mental work on the Pacific Coast and one of the state
liest in America. Men do not hesitate to support
great enterprises when well assured that something
will be achieved, and that assurance they have in the
present case. The list of contributions has been headed
by Claus Spreckels with $10,000. Mayor Phelan
promptly followed the lead with a contribution of
$5000, John W. Mackay contributed $5000 and "a
friend" added $5000 more, making the' total of $25,000
with which the committee begins its work.
Upon this showing of contributions already made
it will be seen that citizens are not to be asked to sub
scribe to a doubtful undertaking. It may be regarded
as certain that a monument to the great admiral whose
victory has marked the beginning of a new epoch in
American history will be erected in San Francisco
within the near future, and every citizen who feels
within him either national patriotism or civic pride
will be glad to be able to contribute to it.
According to one expert the coal fields of Great
! Britain will be exhausted within fifty years, and ac
cording to another the mouth of the Thames will be
choked up so that large vessels cannot get to the city.
It is therefore high time for British optimists to begin
j to talk about storing up sunlight for heating purposes
and making use of flying ships for commerce.
With the gold fields of Alaska panning out very
j well to the north of us and new gold fields paying well
to the south, San* Francisco ought to feel something
like a bonanza thrill in her business this year.
Bryan's statement that something may be added to
I the Chicago platform, but nothing can be taken from
it, is equivalent to saying it may be made worse but
I it cannot be improved.
Unless the Supervisors during the day cool off con
-1 siderably on the street railway franchise proposition,
j there is likely to be a hot time in the old town to-
I night.
RETRENCHMENT
WILL BE THE
REGENTS' POLICY
University Funds to
Be Saved.
AVERTING A BIG DEFICIT
SALARIES AND ASSISTANTS
WILL BE AFFECTED.
President Kellogg's Place Will Very
Probably Be Filled at the Meet
ing to Be Held on
June 13.
The committee on ways and means re
cently appointed by the Regents of the
State University to devise some} plan to
avert a threatened deficit, met yesterday
and agreed on a system of retrenchment
that will be equal to the occasion.
Under present expenses and a much
shortened Income, the Regents have fig
ured they will be behind just $48,000 when
the next fiscal year shall have passed.
There was no plain way out of the diffi
culty that the Regents could find, so it
was decided to place the matter In the
hands of the finance committee and a
special committee of three, and let those
six find- a remedy. The finance commit
tee is composed of Regents Hallidie, Rod
gers and Miller; the special committee of
Regents Denieke, Slack and Rowell. Mr.
Rpdgers and Mr. Miller were away and
the other four met at Colonel Denicke's
residence yesterday afternoon.
Since the appointment of the commit
1> a the heads of the various departments
of the university have been communicated
with; the condition of the institution has
been explained to them and the necessity
for retrenchment has been pointed out,
and they were all a&ked to submit to the
committee some idea of the amount they
could save and the way they could save
it. The reports submitted were the sub
jects of discussion at yesterday's confer
ence. ,
The report of the committee will not he
madÂ« public until the meeting of the Re
gents on June 13. There arc a good many
details that will have to be considered
and discussed, but the general plan is one
of such retrenchment as will keep the uni
versity running on what money it has
while not seriously interfering with the
efficiency of the institution. The plan of
retrenchment will necessarily reduce the
staff to some extent and also some of the
salaries, but there will be no radical
changes. It was reported at one time that
the deficit would be avoided by the exac
tlon of a fee from each of the students,
and there was a good deal of adverse
comment on the proposed inauguration of
such a policy; and there was another â¢ re
port to the effect that money would be
raised by subscription, and that, too, was
condemned. It is probable that the com
mittee will not find tiny necessity for
making any departure so radical as the
Hrhcrne of fees.
The idea of allowing the presidency to
remain vacant until at least a year had
nassed and so save a clear ten thousand,
was nlso brought, to the attention of the
committee, it met little favor, however.
The committee was of the opinion that
the university could not lie properly con
ducted without an executive head. That
tin plan has heen abandoned is proved
by the fact that a President will very
probably be elected at the meeting on
Juno 13. The Regents are all ready to
vote on the candidates, and there Is a
general desire to have the place filled and
thÂ«- matter settled. The identity of the
successful candidate, however, is still a
matter of speculation.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Penalties to the amount of $1,119,945
j were incurred during the year ending
March 31 last for delay in the fulfillment
i of contracts for the British navy, but
; were only enforced in two cases to the cx
i tent of $275.
The subscription collected by the Paris
' ian newspaper Matin footed up to $77,915,
' which sum the Minister of Marine has
promised to apply at once to the object
intended, that, of building two small sub
marine torpedo-boats.
An imposing German fleet left Kiel on
May 3 for a two months' cruise in the
Baltic and North Sea. It consisted of
four first class and two second class
battle-ships, one coast defense vessel and
two small cruisers aggregating 61,500 tons
and carrying a crew of 3700.
The French cruiser Cecllle, built In 1888,
has just been recommisloned at Toulon
where she was thoroughly repaired. The
Cecllle has done considerable service and
been a very satisfactory ship, and now
after eleven years made 19 knots on her
trial, which is exactly the speed she at
tained when prepared for her first com
mission. She is of 5933 tons and 10,200
horsepower, and carries a battery of eight
6.4-Inch quick-iirers; ten 5.5-inch; ten 2
pounders and fourteen machine ,guns.
The London Engineering directs atten
tion of the British naval authorities to
the superiority of American naval gun
nery as evidenced at target shooting and
the running fight off Santiago. It claims
that the American target 56 feet by 16*4
feet is larger than that used in the Brit
ish navy, but urges at the same time that
"Money can hardly be better spent on
any purpose connected with war which
would yield such fruit as that laid out in
perfecting our shooting."
The French naval appropriations have
increased during the past thirty years to
enormous proportions. In ISBB they
amounted to* $34,400,000 and diminished to
$23.Â«O0,00O in 1872. In 1890 the total was
$40,300,000, and for the present year It is
$60,400,000 or 50 per cent over that of nine
years ago. For new construction, in
cluded in the foregoing totals, $7,172,000
was allowed in 1890, and $18,538,000 for 1899.
The personnel, which in 1897 numbered
39,586 men, is now to be Increased to
44,620.
A mammoth drydock at Glasgow is
ready for service, the test of Its pump
ing machinery having pasÃcd off satis
factorily.. The dock is 880 feet long and
81 feet 8 inches wide on the floor. It is
115 feet wide at top, 83 feet at entrance
and carries 26 feet 6 inches over the sill.
The dock can be divided by a central
caisson in lengths of 420 and 460 feet.
The pumps cleared the dock of 66.033 tons
of water in 90 minutes, givfng the con
tractor a margin of 21 minutes to spare,
and the outer section of 460 feet can be
pumped out in 35 minutes.
The British battle-ship Renown of 12,3i0
tons arrived at Portsmouth dockyard on
April 30, returning from the North
American station. The ship made the
trip from Bermuda to St. Catherine, a
distance of 3010 knots, in 196 hours, giving
an average speed of 15 knots an hour and
consumed 1200 tons of coal making the
passage. The trial speed of the Renown
under forced draught was IS knots, but
| the recent sea speed under natural
! draught extending for over eight days is
: a very creditable performance.
Three torpe<lo-boat destroyers for the
British navy have recently passed
through their trials with good results.
i They are all denominated as 30-knot
boats and of 300 tons. The Cygnet, built
by Thorneycroft. made 30.6S knots over
the measured mile and averaged 30.375
knots during a three hours' run. The
Mermaid, from the yard of Leslie &
Hawthorne at Newcastle made 30.926
knots over the measured mile and 30.833
knots during a three hours' run, develop
ing 7024 horsepower or 1024 in excess of
the contract. The Orwell, built at Laird's,
i Birkenhead, ran over the measured mile
at a speed of 30.7 knots and averaged 30.2
during a three hours' run at aea.
At the meeting of the Royal United
Service Institute in London on March 8,
the "Lesson of the Battle Off Santiago"
was discussed by Rear Admiral A. K.
Wilson, Admiral ('olomb and other
prominent naval experts. Rear Admiral
Wilson closed his recital of the naval
event by saying: "I have not the slight
est doubt that if the Americans had been
turned into Cervera'B shipsâ in bad con
dition as they wereâ they would have
made a very good fight of it. It is the
energy and enterprise of the race, of
which we hope we may have our share
as members of the same race, that, I
think, is the greatest factor in the suc
cess of the Americans."
OPPOSED TO
EXAMINATIONS
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir; Al
though a citizen of no note or importance
(socially, I wish to add my feeble protest
to that now being made by so many
against the cruelty and injustice of the
impending examination of the children of
the- public schools. I am the father of a
child who can show a year's record card
of the highest standard among a class of
sixty scholars. So much so that two
months ago we heard from the teacher
that by uniform attention to and excel
lence in studies this child was already en
titled to the medal; also that this pupil's
reputation for honesty in study could be
vouched for by all fellow scholars. Now,
is this year's record to go for nothing.
Is it just that a year of nonest and suc
cfsÂ«ful study should be weighed in the
balance with a hurried and favored exam
ination of an hour? Especially if a child
is of a retiring disposition and apt to be
flurried and nervous before strangers.
Certainly such a child is not at his best
compared with other children either more
self-composed or more forward, or less
honest as to their methods of success
than he is. I think this examination
business is a deliberate injustice and that
all parties concerned should cry- out
against it and insist that the year's rec
ord shall be the only standard by which
efficiency shall be tested. I remain yours
very respectfully.

GOLD IN A WATCH CASEâ D. R. T.
C, Auburn, v CaUÂ». To extract the gold
from an eighteen-karat gold watch case
the case must be pounded in a mortar
and placed in a bath of nitric acid and
allowed to remain until there is no longer
any fuming. That will eat away all the
base metal that it may contain. Then
the material must be rinsed and driod,
then rolled in sheet lead, placed in a cupe!
and then into a muffled furnace. That
will dissipate the lead and then there
will remain a button of gold. If it is de
sired to refire the gold so as to make it
of a higher grade, there must be xdded
two parts or silver to one of gold and
the same process gone through.
TWO HULLSâ F. J., City. In relation
to the question as to the difference in
tonnage between a steel hull and a wooden
bull of exactly the same dimensions G.
W. Dickie of the Union Iron Works says:
"Ac to register tonnage there would be
no difference between the tonnage of one
vessel and another that measure the same
internally, as the interior cubic capacity
of the vessel in cube feet divided by one
hundred is the register tonnage. This,
however, has nothing to do with the car
rying capacity of a vessel. Very often the
register tonnage is confounded with the
dead weight carrying capacity. As a rule
the steel vessel of the same register ton
nage will carry more than the wooden
vessel on account of the very material
difference in the weight of the hull of
the one as compared with that of the
other, but there is no rule to determine
what that difference is. It depending en
tirely on the structure of the wooden ves
sel and the weight ot material used
therein*"

Able Sermons Delivered by the Dis
tinguished Visitors to Congrega
tions of This Cityâ Their
Thoughts in Brief.
THERE are scores of orators in this
city. The pulpit has furnished an
array of Christian pleaders who
have uplifted the members of their
congregation to higher ideals; the
law has its qu.Â«ta of spellbinders who
have snatched victories from certain de
feat by Imbuing juries with the justice
of tln-ir course in their clever speeches.
ami the lay profession has any number '>f
champions whose voices and logic have
charmed audiences and raised them to a
high pitch of enthusiasm. But there are
thousands in this city who are of the
opinion that none of our local speakers
â  ompares with the Rev. George C. Lor
the distinguished divine who
preached at the services <>f the First Bap
tist Church yesterday morning at the
Alhambra Theater.
Seldom has an audience listened to such
a brilliant discourse as was delivered by
the Boston preacher. Nearly 2000 people
were seated in the Moorish play house
which for the occasion was turned into
a place of worship to accommodate the
crowds desirous of hearing the em
inent pulpit orator. Nor were they
disappointed. For about an hour and
a half he thrilled them with his
tence, and when they departed their
minds were filled with the views he ex
pressed on many themes.
The services were opened by the Rev.
A. J. Rowlands, secretary of the Baptist
Publication Society, who announced the
singing of an anthem by the choir, com
poaed of Mis:; Fanny L. Denny soprano,
Miss Florence Nagel alto. Herbert Wil
liams first tenor, Arthur A. Macurda sec
ond tenor, I). B. Crane first bass and
Matbew McCunie second bass, and H. K.
Mitchell accompanist. At the conclusion
of the singing Rev. D. B. Cheney of Wis
consin, whose father was formerly pas
tor of tho First Baptist Church and who
Is himself a native son. Invoked the di
ng. This was followed by Rev.
li. L. Mirehouse of New York reading
Psalm 7-: "Give the King thy judg
ments. O <iod. and thy righteousness unto
the King's son." Dr. E. B. Hulbert,
i the Chicago Theological Semin
ary, and former pastor of the First Bap
hur^h of this city, led in prayer.
Dr. Rowlands Introduced Dr. Lorimer to
his audience in a short speech in which
he said that the Eastern clergyman had
given up his life to the great studies of
. ly. As the pale-faced but intellec
tual little giant stepped forward a hush
fell on the congregation. "You will lind
the words of my text," he coldly said, "in
the second chapter of Daniel, the forty
d verse."
And In the day? nf those kins? shall the
God at heaven set up a kingdom, which
Fhall never be dentroyed. nor shall the sov
pr^'pnty thereof be lfft to another people;
but it shall break in pieces and consume all
the?e kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.
Closing his eyes and folding his arms on
his breast the doctor opened his sermon
on "Christianity as a World-Power." "A
dream, only a dream," he said, "is likely
to be the mocking language of the so-called
practical men of the world, who regard it
as an evidence of superior sanity to trust

mortal declaration is read in their hear
ing."

congregation that an old lady asked him

in the middle of his address when

During his sermon he alluded to
France's treatment of Dreyfus, whom he
believed to bo innocent. He described the
persecuted Jewish officer seated in his

around him and offered thanks and con

been smitten by the mysterious fragment
'if rock cut from a mountain without hands,
and which Daniel had interpreted in the
passage before us. A.nd what then? Are
all such disclosures necessarily unworthy
of credence? "Was not Abimelech divinely
guided throueh a dream? Was not the
immediate future of Egypt accurately fore
shown to Pharoah through the Fame
means? Assyrian cuneiform â  inscriptions
relate the accomplishment of various events
that were anticipated in sleep.
Thus Qyges, Kins of Lydia, had been ad
monished to enter on an alliance with
AsHUrbanipal, and by this method Egypt
had been encouraged to unite against the
Assyrians. Likewise in Persian history
rulers, such as Afrasiab and Xerxes, were
warned and directed when their senses were
wrapped in slumber, and the scenes uncur
tained were faithful counterparts of ap
proaching realities. And what are all the
successes or our modern era, all the con
quests over nature, all the triumphs over
tyranny, all the vindications of human
rights, but th- fulfillment of dreams
dreamed by saints and sages, noets and
philosophers, for the announcement of which
they were derided and cursed, were shut
up in prison and thrust out of life? As
these visions have not failed, so neither
have we reason to reject as inherently in
credible those which agitated the mind of
Nebuchadnezzar, and which | for centuries
have filled the world with hope.
It is very generally assumed by com
mentators that we have in the King's
huge, composite image a prophecy of suc
cessive empires. There is, first of all.
Babylon, the head of gold; then the Medes
and Persians, the breast and arms of sil
ver; followed by the Macedonian, the belly
and thighs of brass, and terminating with
the Roman, the legs of iron, whose feet are
partly iron and partly clay. Frequently has
It been brought to the attention of students
that the description of Rome is very fine
and very pertinent. As a world power the
trampled down all opposers and was ut
terly ruthless and merciless;, while ulti
mately she . undermined her own stability
by dividing Into east and west, and by
mingling in her poulation aliens and free
men, and by blending with her customs
and manners tin' practices and vices of the
nations she bad conquered. In the words
of an old write.r, "The Kyrinn Orontes pol
luted the waters of the Tiber."
Christianity as n World-Power: This
then Is my them<\ appropriate, I trust, to
this first assembling of our national societies
on the shores of the Pacific, from which
notable event should date a new era in the
history of cur denomination. In Its discus
sion I shall not follow the order of its de
velopment eLe we have it in Daniel's inter
pretations! for by a slightly different
method it can be rendered clearer and
more practical.
The originality of Christianity as a
world-power in worthy of serious thought.
If anything Is plain it U the difference
that exists between the metallic and the
stone empires. The latter Is cut out of the
mountain without hands; that is, has a
providential beginning, and only of It is
the record Riven "that the God of heaven
shall set up a kingdom.' Those that are
of the earth are born of mixed human mo
tives and ambitions, and have bei n the re
sult of various political or warlike move
ments None of them is warranted In claim
ing for Itself the origin which distinguishes
religion..
Hut in addition to this peculiarity it is to
be observed that Christianity is to fill the
whole earth. In every sphere and terri
tory occupied by the linage, and even be
yond it is to penetrate. Perhaps we shall
be told that Jopus said, "My kingdom la
not of this world": and that therefore we
are not warranted In speaking of if at all
as a world-power. Hut why not? Are we
sure that our Lord's words are understood?
What he meant was not that his empire
was excluded from relationship with human
affairs, but that It was never designed to
copy other world-powers and strive to be
like them. It is one of the grave mistakes
committed by some pious people that they
regard organized religion as merely a means
to itself, whose sole function Is the salvation
of individuals from the peril of perdition.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 29, 1899.
whereas It constantly proclaims that it has
come to inaugurate a "renewed earth where
in dwelleth rifchtousness."
All prophetic visions which relate to this
subject represent the mountain of the Lord
as exalted above the hills, and in other
glowing figures reveal it as blessing in tem
poral as .well as in spiritual things. Jesus
himself confirms this view in some of his
parables, and there is hardly room lelt for
serious controversy.
That Christianity is fitted for domestica
tion in all the earth is evidence of the gulf
that separates it from other powers. Pro
fessor Seeley is filled with wonder at the
many-sidedness of Great Britain, ruling
â despotically in Asia and democratically in
Canada, and adapting herself to Moslem ex
clusiveness in the East and to free thought
and spirituality in the West. Perhaps the
secret is not difficult to solve. Hut there
is a more startling phenomenon; it is that
of a religion assuming to be capable of
satisfying the cravings of mankind, and to
rule for the common good European and
Asiatic, Saxon and Slav, civilized and sav
age.
Two tendencies are observable to-day. The
one is toward secular imperialism. It is
the dream of nationalities in the old world,
and" is not without charm for ourselves in
the new. Success along this line apart from
religion is freighted with ultimate mischief
and peril. Hut the other trend Is more en
couraging and more ennobling; it is toward
the triumphant imperialism of Christianity.
For which shall we labor? I am not Baying
that they are necessarily inconsistent with
each other; but so far as grandeur and
sublimity are concerned. T would rathbr de
vote myself to the second than to the tlrst.
Would not you? 'As for me, I would rather
stain! with Livingston, Carey. Marshman,
Judson. than I would with Cllve. Hastings
and Lawrence; and I would rather in the
Â»nd be associated with Christ and tils
apostles than 1 would with Caesar anil the
legions thundering at his heels. Would not
you? Between them we must make our
choice. And I appeal to this great assembly
nl Christians and citizens, by the glorious
imagery we have studied, which holds form
the precious hope of a spiritually trans
formed and morally regenerated social State,
to array themselves beneath the banners
of Christ, and here pledge life, fortune and
pacred honor, that he may "see of the tra
vail of his soul and be satisfied."
YOUNG BAPTISTS WERE
GIVEN GOOD ADVICE
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the mem
bers of the Baptist. Young People's. Union
came together in the auditorium of the
church and for two and* a half hours lis
tened to some rousing speeches on practi
cal Christianity and the true spirit of the
simon-pure Baptist. Eloquence from the
four quarters of the country poured
out without stint and that the meeting
was intensely interesting to ; those who
participated was demonstrated by the
fact that there were no less than one
thousand persons, young and old. present
to listen.
â¢ The meeting was opened with prayer
and song and then Rev. C. M. Carter of
Muncie. Ind., was introduced to his audi
ence. He had for his subject "The Baptist
Young People's Union and Its Relations."
It was a talk of instruction to
the younger Baptists of the church,
but it was ; listened t. to. with â¢ ; wrapt
attention by the ' elders' as well as
the younger people present. Dr. Carter
decried narrow â  sectarianism â¢ that ac
knowledged the good in no other creeds
than its own but at the same time pointed
out that every true Baptist should know
and have faith in his ownchurbh and its
tenets.
He was followed by Rev. W. G. Par
tridge, D.D., of Cincinnati, Ohio, who
spoke at considerable length on "Training
for Service.". He held up the fact to the
younger members that there is always
room in the field for earnest workers, and
dwelt earnestly upon the necessity for
beginning preparation during the earlier
years and outlined the plan' of training
that the older heads had found of great
est efficacy. â¢ '",-..â 
Rev. E. E. Chiyers, general secretary of
the Union, delivered a sermon that in

SECRETARIES DISCUSSED
INTERESTING SUBJECTS
In the evening a missionary mass meet
ing was held In the First Baptist Church.
The sacred edifice was crowded to the
doors with interested worshipers, who
listened Intently to the addresses deliv
ered by R. Q. Seymour. D.D., H. C. Ma
bie, D.D., and T. J. Morgan, D.D. Rev.
H. L. Morehouse acted as chairman of the
meeting.
The first speaker was Dr. Seymour, mis
sionary secretary of the Educational So
ci<t\. His subject was on "Personality
in Missions." In part he said:
The word mission Is a very wonderful word.
There are some who shrink from It, because
it implies a propagation ot the great facts of
thi-lr religion. It is a broad word, for it belts
the Klobe. It Is an extra scriptural word: It
is not found within the lids of the Bible, and
yet the whole spirit of the Bible Is In It. It
Is part and parcel of our religious nomencla
ture. We have tried and tried in vain to find
a substitute for it. It has now a place for
â¢itself. It does not belong to any distinctive
field but to every field. It belongs to every
Christian life. No man can get a single step
outside of his own life's path without becom
ing a missionary. "As thou hast sent me into
the world even so have 1 also sent them into
the world." So in this priestly prayer of
Jesus we have conjoined his commission and
ours as missionaries â sent ones. The extent
and range of faith depends upon the breadth
of our visitant. That is, however widely the
Lord has opened our eyes it may be only to
see our white brother who lives in India,
Africa or the Philippines. We believe in our
great missionary organizations which are here
at the Golden Gate celebrating their anniver
saries-, one its eighty-fifth, one its seventy-fifth,
one its sixty-seventh. We can measure the
work which has been accomplished by these
societies. They are in the heart 6of the peo
ple. They are mighty engines for the dis
semination of the gospel and the establishment
of Christ's kingdom; the great machinery by
which Baptist churches have sent the electrical
power of the Individual life throbbing with
force and licht to the ends of the earth. I
have wondered whether faith in these organiza
tions has not allowed many to excuse them
selves from a personal participation in the
work of saving lost men. And this Is the
reason I emphasize now "Personality In Mis
sion?." â¢ . . ..
After the singing of a hymn. Rev. Hen
ry D. Mabie, secretary of the American
Baptist Mission Union, was introduced
and spoke on "The Resurrectionâ Errand
of the Church."
The address of Dr. Mabie was an endeavor
to show the intimate connection between the
doctrine of Christ's resurrection. Its spiritual
apprehension by the church, with its illustra
tion in the life of the Church and the preva
lence or non-preva'"?nee of missionary convic
tion. He began his address, by calling atten
tion to the fact that the promulgation of tha
Great Commission, as it is recorded at the
end of the Gospels, was reserved until after
Christ's resurrection from the dead. It was
the supreme event connected with the forty
days of post-resurrection of earthly life. Other
injunctions of every sort, he said. Including
the sermon on the mount, the law of prayer,
the principle of forgiveness of injuries, mercy
to the needy, etc., "were plainly and emphatical
ly taught previous to Chrlsfa crucifiction and
resurrection. Hut the Great Commission itself
was reserved to a unique occasion. ' '
SOUNDING BRASS AND
TINKLING CYMBAL
Rev. Kerr Boyce Tupper, a distinguish
ed Baptist minister nf Philadelphia, occu
pied the pulpit of the First. Presbyterian
Church last evening and preached an able
sermon. His text was, "Jesus of Nazareth
went about doing goodâ Acts x:3B. In
part he said:
"This la the most attractive picture giv
en by Inspiration of the Son of God. More
than that, it is the only of the divine pho
tographs lust suited to our age. We live
,in an age of practical benevolence, of util
itarian tendencies. The Romans em
phasized power, the Greeks learning, the
Hebrews religion, the Americans deeds
as proving creeds. The Christ that the
world needs to-day is the one which
matches sermons with services, doctrines
with doings, creeds with characters.
"It is a remarkable fact that Christ
wrote nothing. His impress upon the
world comes through acts rather than
through writings. Plato and Homer wrote
and lived; Christ wrote not, yet lives .is
no Greek author ever lived. The secret
of his influence over men is found in the
fact that he illustrated in his life th<*
doctrines of his mjnd. blending theory
and practice with perfect purity of pri
vate life and public action. The tributes
of the great men of the world to him. as
from Carlyle and Leckey, are based
chiefly upon his tender philanthropy and
noble living.
"And Christ buttressed his deed with
his creed. Three majestic and supreme
doctrines characterize his teaching, and
these doctrines the world needs to-day:
First, the Fatherhood of God. Once God
was more to man a judge; now he is a
Father. Second, the brotherhood of the
race. The ancient Hebrew was bigoted
and narrow. No man to-day can be a
true follower of Christ who does not be
lieve in the brother man as the one to be
loved and helped. There was no poor la
bor that Christ would not touch, no home
of Squalor that he would not enter, no
humble class he would not help. An un
gem rous soul can never be the soul of
a Christian. Third, the improbability of
a soul. Once it was a wish, now it is a
conviction; once it was a probability,
now it is a certainty. By the grave Christ
stood where philosophers had thrown un
answered their questions Into the dark
ness, and he said, 'I am the resurrection
and the life.' All the darkness of his day
he would illumine by revelation from the
other world, where once he dwelt in an
ineffable way with the Father.
"The great lesson from all this is that
no life can be true that is not benevolent.
Christianity without these elements 'is
'sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.'
Better have little light and much love
than to have a full revelation and a nar
row soul."
CHARMED HIS HEARERS
WITH WORD PICTURES
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con
gregational Church shared his pulpit last
evening with Rev. Dr. Poteat, one of the
most prominent divines of Philadelphia,
Pa., who Is just now touring the West.
Both by his eloquence and breadth of
thought Dr. Poteat has bullded a reputa
tion throughout the Eastern States and
the magnificent sermon he preached la-st
evening will certainly leave him as firm
ly fixed in the minds of San Francisco's
church goers.
Dr. Poteat took for his theme "The
Light of the World." He spoke eloquent
ly and at length of the revelational as
pect of Christianity, presenting his
thought in the following points: First,
the statement made by Jesus, "1 am the
Light"; second, the self-consciousness
Jesus evinced in the statement; and third,
the pure question of fact.
Said he: "Our Lord conceived all the
institutions of religion to be for the time
being summed up in his person and that
all the -generations of men must look to
Him for light. In such self-conscio.usness
he was either a stark lunatic, a blatant
fool, or he knew himself and his relation
to the world and spoke the utter truth."
"As a matter of fact, attested in mul
titudinous experiences, he la the light of
the world," continued Dr. Poteat. "The
world without him is a world of dark
ness, of weariness and suicide; the world
of'Zeno, of Hume, of Yon Hartman, of
Byron. The world with Christ in it is the
world of John and Paul and Bunyan, and
ail our social and personal and world
problems can be read aright and solved
only in his light, for he is the light of the
world."
This in brief was Dr. Poteat's remark
able sermon. The word pictures he paint
ed in Its elaboration could be presented
only in his own fashion. In most vivid
English he drew the antithesis between
the waste world of Byron and Hume and
the lightened paths traced by Paul and
John. He cast aside the facts, and thÂ»
ories made common by daily use and
dipped deeper into the Bible for fact and
lope to prove the things he had to say.
His sermon was such a one as is not too
often heard in this city and, his hearers
express the hope that he may be heard
again before he returns to the East.'
DR. LORIMER WAS
A REAL SURPRISE
OAKLAND, May S2.â Rev. George C.
Lorimer, D.D., L.L.D.. of Tremont Tem
ple; Boston, who has been attending the
Baptist anniversaries, created a sensation
at the Memorial services held in the Ex
position building to-night by the Baptist
churches on this side of the bay.
During .the course of his eloquent dis
course on "Old Glory" Dr. Lorimer al
luded to politics several times. He said
first that he did not care from what
source an army was drawn so long as it
be American "and have an able Secretary
of , War .at .its head and no embalmed beef,
success' and victory will attend it wher
ever it went."
â Referring -to the act of Congress forbid
ding the sale of liquor in the canteens,
whk-h act. on .the advice of the Attorney
General, was declared inoperative, the
sneaker said it was about time to get a
I new legal adviser to the President when
! si:i-h advice as this can be expected.
! Trusts and monopolies the speaker
branded as menacing the liberties of the

Cargo Arrives on the
National City.

CAME FROM THE APOLLO MINE
ON UNGA ISLAND.
The "Sand" Is Valued at Over $100

Is Worth Considerable.
Money.
The steamer National City attracted a
great deal of attention at Main-street
wharf yesterday morning. She was all
the way from Unga Islund with a cargo
of "sand," and the crowd could not un
derstand how such an article came to be
shipped so great a distance when enough
of the same kind of stuff to load every
vessel afloat could be procured at the
ocean beach.
Then the National City was very deep
ly laden and such great care had been
taken that not an ounce of the deck load
should be lost. The forward part of the
main deck had been into a large
box with an arched roof. This was made
throughout of inch planking and was fas
tened together as securely as nails and
the joiners' art could make it. Tons of
water wash over the structure but never
move it the fraction of an inch.
Just forward of the pilot house a well
was left in order to catch the water that
might get into the house and percolate
through the cargo, and in this way any
chance of loss was reduced to a mini
mum. The crew of the vessel said the
cargo consisted of 450 tons of sand, and
at lirst blush it seemed incredible that
such care should be taken of the cargo.
But when it is known that this particular
sand contains $100 per ton gold dust
and that it is on its way to Selby's Smelt
ing Works, the care taken to save every
ounce of it is explained.
The National City left here for Unga
Island about a month ago. She carried
a very large cargo and twenty miners for
the Apollo mine. The passage north was
a very unpleasant one and everybody
aboard was glad when it was over. It
took some time to discharge and load the
vessel and it was not until the 18th inst.
that Captain Dettmers was ready to start
back again. Two miners from the Apollo
mineâ 'W. Cushin"- and A. Wildeâ took
passage on the National City. They have
spent a year on Unga Island and have
come home for a rest. It blew very hard
the tirst few days out and Captain Dett
mers had to run his vessel into Sand
Point for shelter.
The barkentine Fremont and schooner
Winchester of the codfishing fleet had
been at Sand Point, but had cone back to
the banks before the National City got in.
The mail steamer Newport reached Unga
on the 17th inst. and th<- staling schooner
Olga put in there for water a few days
before that, but went on her cruise again
as soon as her water tanks were filled.
The last few days of the passage Captain
Dettmers had to economize his coal sup
ply. It began to run short, and in order
to reach port the National City had to
come along at half speed. Tt was origi
nallv the intention tn have taken her to
Selby's direct, but instead of that she had
to go to Main-street wharf and coal up.
As soon as that was done she went up the
river and her cargo of gold-bearing sand
will be carefully discharged to-day.
SIXTEENTH INFANTRY HERE.
Will Leave for Manila To-Day on the
United' States rransport Grant.
The Sixtprnth Infantry arrived from
Fort Crook, Nebraska, Jefferson barracks,
Missouri, and Fort Leavenworth, Kans.,
yesterday en route for Manila.
Company B and the band was the first
detachment to come over the bay and
they were followed at regular Intervals
b\ the other companies during the day.
Before dark all the men had arrived and
were safely housed aboard the transport
Grant at Folsom-street wharf. They are
a splendid body of men and made a fine
appearance, as they marched along p:ast
street. The majority of them are very
young and there is not an old man in the
ranks.
Colonel Hood is the commander of the
regiment, but he is not going to Manila
at this time, so Lieutenant Colonel Spur-
Kin is in command. The other officers
are: Majors â Kirkman and Ward; cap
tainsâ Wcodbury, Allen, Thursten, Buck.

their Joy.
Since the season opened there has been
a number of sensational games played
here, but that of yesterday threatened
every minute to throw the good spectators
.1 Into hysterics. There was not a
dull Becond during the proceedings. Ev
ery one of tho eighteen participants was
on his mettle and thrilling deeds followed
each other in bewildering profusion. When
the tumult was all over Mr. Donlin had
earned the right hereafter to be addressed
by his Intimates as Michael; heretofore
he has been plain Mike. For the left
winged lobster had, for the third succes
sive game lie has gone against them,

ians.
Santa Cruz has three twirlers and it
was the intention to use one in each
gajnt h( re, but I-. Halsz, who has just
signed a life contract with a charming
Native Daughter, would rot have it so.
Louli 'luled to pitch Saturday's
but that did not suit his fancy. He

on Saturday the newly-made benedict

land Park altogether, leaving Daubenbis
t i do the twirling. But in the afternoon
the young man tripped out on the dia
mond dei Iced nut In a brand new white
puit and prepared to array himself before
the assemblage. That's where he made
hi a third bad guess. Manager Tuttle de
\> rmin<;<i that DO ball player could trifle
with his authority with impunity, so
when the team starfd out in the Held for
the first inning, Halsz was told to wrap
himself up in his sweater and make him-
Belf comfortable on the bench. It was
a crushing blow to his aspirations, but he
â will not get gay again right away.
I'nele Hank's cohorts went on the
ground flushed with the victory of the
morning and prepared to make it a double
header. But there was nothing about the
Oakland gam*-- to makÂ»> them jubilant.
Daubenbis was as wild an an inmate of
the Magdalen Asylum and simply present

the second inning, when, with one
out, O'Nell was given his base, took sec
ond on a passed ball, stole third and

Runs were picked up in the fifth ajid

result of a gift by Daubenbis, and though
the lobsters struggled desperately live
were all the tallies they could score, game,
being called in their half of the ninth to
enabled the teams to get back to the city,
But enough of the morning game. After
the cyclone of the afternoon It will never
more be thought of.
Fred Swanton and his band of 200 fa
â  from the seashore invaded the
giand stand early ana every one of tnom
endured all the agonies of irreclaimable
cranks. They were attacked with cold
feet, hemorrhages and delirium by turns;
their whoops, howls and groans shatter
ing the Sabbath into a million fragments,
Their boisterous conduct when they were
making any noise at all Jarred on the
nerves of the 7800 loyal San Franciscans
present, but on the occasions that the
focal p'Oters had a chance to applaud they
inded with such enthusiasm that
Swanton went to his hotel with such a
n< adache. It was a wildly demonstrative
crowd. The grand .stand was filled, while
the blr-acherÃ at both ends were crowded
nearly the full length.
And such a game! For five Innings not
a run was made, but In the sixth the lo
cals broke the ice with one tally, which
â was offset by Santa Cruz in their half.
Then the latter took the lead with two
runs and scored again in the eighth. San
Francisco did nothing more until the
I ninth, when they hammered in two runs j
I and came within an ace of tying the
score. It was the fastest finish seen here
in many years and everybody actually
felt relieved when the trouble was all
over. To give due credit to all the men
who did good work would be to mention
every player Individually, but Pace de
serves special credit, i'or he went into the
game with the nail of his right forefinger
ready 10 drop off and a digit on his left
hand that looked like a stewed prune.
Nevertheless he caught the string out
and made a couple of phenomenal catches
on foul flies, besides throwing to bases
with his usual speed and accuracy.
Fireman Fitz was not hit hard by the
Lobsters, but their hits came at oppor
tune times, while Frisco's six hits were .
scattered through the last four Innings.
Fitz fielded his position as it is si Idom
fielded and had it not been for a brace of
errors by Sullivan a different tale might
have been told.
The locals opened up in the sixth, when
Pyne was given his base, was sacrificed
to sec-nil by Krug and brought home by
Rilev's double. Devereaux did likewise
for Santa Cruz in its half, by pushing out
a double, advancing on Pace's long fly to
i-.-ntrr and scoring on a short passed ball.
In the seventh the lobsters picked a
couple, after Frisco's chame had been
spoiled by a beautiful double play. \\ Itn
I one out Kleibi-r was safe on bulhvan s
fumble of his grounder, and stole Becond.
Burge's double put him across the rubber.
The~ latter tried for third and made it.
! but would have been out bad Riley held
the ball. Drennan hit a long fly out to
Muller and "Monkey" beat the ball to the
p!ate The visitors clinched the game in |
; the eighth, Streib getting a single, taking
second on Kleiber's out, and scoring on 1
1 Sully's second bungle.
When the locals came to bat in the
; ninth the excitement was Intense, for al
though they had not been able to score in
the eighth they had made two hits off
Donlin and the crowd opened up their
i lungs for the purpose of rattling the lob- j
! sters. They succeeded in a measure, for
' Hilderbrandt, the first man up. was given
his base. A mighty shout went up from
the local far..-, while Swanton s deli â -â >-
- tion nearly broke tbÂ« backs off their seal -
i trying to "pull the ball over the plate.
Muller smashed a hot one to Sausage
Kleiber, which fatty made a wonderful
pick-up of. ,He threw to Williams, forc
ing- Hilderbrandt at second, amid the
wild howls of the Santa Cruz contingent,
for the San Franciscan? had become pain
fully silent. They opened up an instant
later, when Williams threw the ball ten
feet over Clark's head in trying to com
plete a double play. Muller went to sec
ond and scored on O'Neill's single, The
crowd forgave Tip all bis past errors then
and there, while Swanton was threatened
With heart failure. Pandemonium broke
loose when Swindells cut loose a 4 double, ,
scoring Tip. Donlin was perceptibly agi
tated for the moment and gave Fitzpat
rick a pass, at which the shouts of the
populace were redoubled. Pyne was given
an ovation, but the best he could do was
to drive one to Kleiber. who tielrled Fitz
out at second. It was the Santa Cruz
crowd's turn to breathe then, while a
lull came in the local fans' demonstra
tions. It was only a lull, for Krug was
encouraged by the mob to "tear the hide
off'm it. Krug is the safest batter in the
team and had made but one hit during the
game, so it seemed as though he must
find Donlin for one punch. The cranks
opened up their batteries on Donlin again,
but the temporary agitation that had
seized him had passed and although a hit
meant the loss of the game with two men
on bases, he was steady as a rock, pitch
ing as he had never pitched before. Three
of those awful inshobts that looked a
yard wide when they started but cut the
inner corner of the plate were handed up
to Krug and he could not find them. The
best batter In the team had struck out
and Santa Cruz was In first place. The
scores of the two games are as follows:

Sacramento Again Defeated.
W.ATSONTILLE, May 28.â Knpp s prize
lot of statesmen again fell victims to the
superior prowess of Struve'a galaxy of
sugar beets to-day. At the beginning of
the seventh inning, lac score was 2 to 1
in favor of the Statesmen, but in that
inning their infield was cut to pieces and
wild throws and fumbles were the order
for a few minutes. As a result of the bad
wreck Watsonville piled up three pegs.
The lead the Sugar Beets had secured
could not be overcome and at the end the
score srood 5 to :'. against the Statesmen.
The battery work of both nines was su
perb. Outside of their battery the Pacra
mentans need lots of fixing. The score:

, inning. Selma getting in two runs when
the score stood 8 to 6. Then no run was
scored until the last half of the eighth,

hard batting, assisted by an error on the
part of the visitors. A number of unpop
ular decisions were rendered by both ur
n! nlres. Implre White gave Miller first
I base in violation of rule 50 when Miller
I ran into and knocked down a Belma field

NATIONAL BIRD
COMES TO GRIEF
AT SCHUETZEN
Eagle Shoot of the
Verein Eintracht.
BARBROCK IS CROWNED KING
ONE MORE CONTESTANT FOR
THE DIAMOND MEDAL.
Thirty-Second Annual Picnic of the
Association Draws an Im
mense Crowd to Maria
Shores.
J. F. Barbrock is a -"king" and the j
proudest member of the Verein Eintracht
Schuetzen section in San Francisco. Aided â 
i first by chance in drawing a lucky num- I
ber and then by a steady nerve when his â 
oportunity came, he has succeeded in â¢
< knocking the last remnant of a wooden
I eagle off the top of a 50-foot pole in the j
great annual "king" shoot of the Verein j
! Eintracht held yesterday at Schuetzen
Park. In his ears still echo the musical
strains of applause welling from the
throats of on-looking thousands, and in
his pockets jingle the material results of
his feat.
But the day was a red-letter occasion
for more than one manâ there were just
eleveji of them in all. What cared R.
Stettin for Barbrock's feat, or Hartmann,
! or Chris Schroeder? Didn't each of them
demolish a piece of that American bird's
anatomy? Certainly, and not a lucky I
rifleman but did not insist that his was
not the most creditable feat of the day. I
There were fully 2000 people at Fred
Schumann's hostelry yesterday before the
noon hour, as two great attractions were
crowded into one of Barnum's "aggrega
tions"âthe thirty-second annual picnic of
the Verein Eintracht and the annual
' "king" shoot of the Verein Entracht
Schuetzen Section. The latter was the.
Chief drawing card and little was done in
| the way of dancing or playing games un
; til it was finished.
In its mouth the eagle held a ring, in
one claw a scepter and in the other an |
â  apple, while on its head a crown symbo- j
; lized the nature of the event. The skill
of J. Kickert caused the loss of the ring
! first of all. but ft took from 11 a. m. to !
! 4 p. m. to pierce the heart of the bird and j
end the contest. s The eagle is alleged to
have died "game."
The members all drew tickets to deter
mine their positions and then began to
pop away. Barbrock's feat was lustily \
I cheered and the other ten winners were
i not slighted. In detail, the winners and
: their deeds wero as follows:
J. F. Barbrock ("king") first, shot the
! last piece away; K. Stettin second, shot
the crown off the eagle's head; J. Hart
mann third, knocked the scepter from a
claw; Chris Schroeder fourth. knocked the
apple from the other; J. Rlckert fifth,
smashed the ring; C. Suehrstedt sixth, de
stroyed the head; C. F. Over seventh,
broke the right wing; Captain F., A.
Kuhls eighth, broke the left wing; M.
Dieckert ninth, broke the right leg; C.
' Ellinger tenth, broke left leg: C. yon
Hartwig eleventh, smashed the tail.
After the eagle was defunct the shoot
j was continued and the marksmen, all of
whom continued to class in the â¢â¢ "king"
shoot, acquired position according to the
excellence of their scores, as follows:
R. Spahr, twelfth, Si; H. Gumbel, thir
teenth,.49; C. Over, fourteenth, 48; F.
Binner, fifth, 44: J. Zahn, sixteenth, 40;
Charles Gumbel. seventeenth, 40; C.

twenty-fifth, 19;. E. Jessen, twenty-sixth,
: 17; O. Thiele. twenty-seventh, 13; H.
; Schroeder, twenty-eighth, 10.
Charles Over made the first best shot
with a score of 23, placing himself among
I the few who will contest for the $150 dia
i mond medal. To become the property
i of any one man he must. win it in five an
i nual contests. V.- ; .-. :
The day at the park was enjoyably
spent by the members of the Verein Ein
tracht in dancing, games and wandering
in small parties over the hillsides. It was
late in the evening when the last train i
load left the park with three rousing
cheers for the day, the t organization.

Eagle Shoot of the Krieger
Verein a Success.
Thore was targrt shooting galore yes
terday at -Shell Mound Park and the
ranges wc-re patronizod by enthusiastic
marksmen from early morning till nearly
dark.
The light was not favorable for good
scoring, but it did not prevent J. E. Gor
man of the Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol
Club from making a fine record with the
pistol at fifty yards on the standard
American target. In five consecutive
phots he made 92, 92, 94, 90, 93â total 461.
This score is within three of the world's
record, now held by E. E. Partridge of
Chicago.
The eagle shoot of the Deutscher Krie
ger Verein excited a great deal of inter
est, and when Max Lengfeld brought
down the last piece of the huge wooden
bird he was crowned king amid much
enthusiasm.
The uniformed members to the number
of thin y-livi went over on the 9 o'clock
boat and began the attack on. the eagle
at 11 o'clock. It was 5 o'clock before the
mnjt-ytic bird was entirely brought to
earth.
The prizes were won In the following or

Crown, K. Sc.hnutenhaus; scepter, Louis
Laubscher; apple. Charles Moritzen; ring,

MIX-UP BETWEEN
A MEDICO AND A
LONGSHOREMAN
The Doctor an Adept
at Fisticuffs.
A SURPRISED COAL-HANDLER
SCIENCE VS. BRUTE STRENGTH
AND COURAGE,
After Being Soundly Thrashed, the
Longshoreman Was Taken Into
the Hospital and Fixed Up
by His Conqueror.
There was an impromptu set-to In front
of the Harbor Hospital on last Saturday
night that lovers of the manly art of
self-defense would have given dollars to
witness. It was a question of science
against brute strength, and science "won
in a walk."
Dr. Frank T. Fitzgibbon of the Harbor
Receiving Hospital staff is a noted ath
lete, and his brother medicos frequently
call him "FHzsimmons" for a joke. To
look at the doctor no one would take him
to be a trained boxer, and on Saturday
night a longshoreman evidently sized him
up as a man skilled in the gentle art of
healing only. Now he is wishing that a
mule had kicked him or a basket of coal
had fallen upon him before he went up
against "Fitzsimmons."
The trouble started in a very simple
manner. The longshoreman went to the
hospital to have a slight wound on his
forehead dressed. Dr. Fitzgibbon attend
ed the man and then advised him to go
home. The latter objected to being ad
visrd, and when he got outside the hos
pital began to abuse the doctor and
everybody connected with the establish
ment. Fitzgibbon warned him to go away
and cease making trouble or else he
would be arrested. Instead of going away
the longshoreman aimed a blow that, had
it taken effect, would have placed the
physician in a deep slumber. Ducking
the blow, the doctor cropp-countered the
giant on the jaw and brought him to his
knees. The big fellow was on his feet
again in an instant, and with a roar he
made for Dr. Fitzgibbon. The latter was
ready for him. and in a moment the fight
was on in earnest.
The man' was a? strong as an ox, and
had just enough drink in him to make
him ugly. Rush after rush was stopped
hy straight lefts from the doctor. Once
the latter tripped over an uneven spot on
the planking and fell, but was out of dan
ger In a moment.
A number of men from the Coast Sea
men's Union saw the fracas and. think
ing it was one of their members getting a
beating from a "scab" boarding master,
they went to his assistance, and in a few
minutes a crowd of them surrounded the
doctor and his opponent. The longshore
man made a frantic rush and swung both
arms like the sails of a treadmill. Had he
ever landed it would have been "all day"
with the doctor. The medico, however,
took things coolly, and as the towering
mass of brawn and muscle came along Dr.
Fitzgibbon side-stepped, and. cross-coun
tering with his right, caught the giant on
the point of the jaw and put him out.
In fact so thoroughly was he out that he
hnd to be carried into the hospital and re
vived on the operating table. Mr. Long
shoreman then took Dr. Fitzglbbon's ad
vice and went home a sadder, sorer but
wiser man. The only marks of the set-to
carried by the doctor are a set of skinned
knuckles and a slight Injury to the palm
of the left hand.

THE OPEN STAKE
AT UNION PARR
Beats Young America
in a Fast Course.
A DAY OF ROYAL SPORT
JUDGE BULL'S DECISIONS ARE
MORE SATISFACTORY.
Dean's Crack Dog Captures the Money
After Heartbreaking Courses.
Narcissus Wins in the
Saplings.
The second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth
-/ -ounds and the final of the open stake
v race were run off yesterday at Union
Coursing Park, and Jimmie Dean's
crack hound Gladiator captured the first
honors. Despite the fact that Gladiator
had been severely bitten on the leg and
neck on. Saturday night by her kennel
mate, Moondyne, the game dog left the
slip with Young America and took near
ly every point in the course. The first
course in the finals was a no go, as
Gladiator lost Bight of the hare after
working him clear across the field. Young
America stayed on the scent, but before
he evened the score Gladiator was beside
him. The final course was exceptionally
exciting on this account.
The sapling stake was carried off by
Narcissus, who literally ran away from
Carmencita after quite a lengthy course.
The hares were unusually swift, the
weather wa^ favorable and the decisions
of Judge Bull were much more satisfac
tory than on the Sunday previous, so all
in all those who journeyed out to the
park enjoyed a day of royal sport.
The betting was exceptionally brisk,
and. as usual, the favorites captured the
bulk of the money.

MURRAY'S ASSAILANTS
NOT YET APPREHENDED
POLICE WATCHING THREE SUS
PICIOUS CHARACTERS.
[t Is Thought That Two of Them Are
Members of the Crew of a Ves
sel at Oakland.
The officers at the Harbor police sta
tion are still investigating the riot which
W occurred on Vallejo street wharf Satur
pt day night, when Deputy Shipping Master
Murray was flred upon by a gang of
supposed "patrolmen" employed by the
Coast Seamen's Union, and hope to be
able to land me of Murray's assailants
in prison within a very few days.
At first there was some doubt as to who
had fired the first .shots, but the testimony
of a number of disinterested eyewitnesses
places the blame on the sailors. Ser
geant Brophy and Officer Thomas Ellis
have bc-en scouring the front diligently In
hopes of locating some of the men, but so
far their work has borne no fruit. Murray
has furnished good descriptions of the
men, but it is naturally supposed that
they will keep In hiding until the storm
blows over. In the meanwhile the officers
connected with the Harbor police station
have been instructed to watch the "patrol
men" closely and search all who are
known as dangerous men for concealed
weapons.
The big Swede, who is believed to have
been the leader of the onslaught, is sup
posed to live in a house on Sixth street.
near Market. A young man for whom he
has always shown an abnormal affection
â¢was seen to enter and leave the house
several times yesterday, and he Is being
closely watched, as the two are seldom
very far apart. As a rule they always
room together, and neither one will. ship
unless the other can sign for the same
vessel.
According to the statement of the wit
nesses there were but three men who
handled guns. One is the big Swede re
ferred to and the others, it is thought, are
members of the crew of a deep-water ves
â el now lying at Oakland. A clobo watch
is being kept for these men on both sides
of the bay, and if they are captured they
I will be severely dealt with, provided Mur
m. raj can recognise them, and he claims to
know all of his assailants well by sight,
but not by name. Murray was arrested
and charged with carrying concealed
weapons, but was soon bailed out.
Nobody deplores the occurrence more
than the officers of the Coast Seamen's
Union. They claim that it will do more
to injure their cause than anything else.
Ihe union meets to-night, and it is prob
able that, the entire patrol system will be
changed and a committee appointed to
assist the police in locating the offenders.

ENUNCIATED PRINCIPLES
OF THE SINGLE TAX
A LARGE AUDIENCE GREETS
ELOQUENT SPEAKERS.
The Pan Francisco Single Tax Club gave
a successful entertainment last night at
Polk Btreet. There were vocal and
instrumental selections and the principles
of single tax were ably enunciated by sev
peakers who have made the sub
ject a special study. The doctrine was
i< â ! as the only remedy for existing
evils of society and i large audience was
agreeably entertained.
The meeting was presided over by Ste
phen Potter, president of the local organ
ization. In the course of his remarks Mr.
said:
"The destitution in our land merits our
tion because the poor are setting
poorer and the rich are awaiting tlie
birth <.f the first American billionaire. --
is an unjust social system and the logical
reform lies in single tax. There, should
be no tax on labor or its products, but
â¢ T.ly on the land, irrespective of improve
ments. Singh? tax is th? only cure for
hard times, for it will stimulate produc
tlon, relieve the glut of tin- labor market
and do away with land speculation. With
it the millionaire and the tramp will be
come unknown quantities. "
1,. M. Manzer was the next speaker.
"That every person,' he said, 'has a

With this rifjht liberty and the

mankind may have a right to life. Land

same thing. Give to man the value for

service for service and hard times will

the earth was common property and that
mankind had an equal right t<> its pos

Ralph Hoyt was the last speaker and
took the stand that right and justice will
soon prevail throughout the land.
''I desire to emphasize the fact." he
said, in concluding, "that waees will go
up only when every man can employ him
self, and this panacea will be afforded
when the single tax is in full force and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAT 29, 1899.
STRUCK WITH
A CUSPIDOR AND
FATALLY HURT
Lodging- House Row
Results Seriously.
THE VICTIM MAY NOT LIVE
JOHN KENNEY ASSAULTED BY
"NICK" LARSEN.
The Latter Is Arrested and Held
Without Bail â Larsen Claims
He Acted in Self-
Defense.
John C. Kenney, who engaged in a dis
turbance in the Acme lodging house at
057 Market street last Friday and was
struck in the forehead with a cuspidor,
inflicting an ugly wound, is in a dyingcon
dition. Blood poisoning has set in and the
attending physician has littl.- hope for the
â wounded man's recovery. Immediately
on learning of Kenney's condition Lieuten
ant Nash of the Southern Station sent Of
ficer Burke to arrest the assailant. Burke
learned that shortly after the disturbance
Kenney swore to a warrant charging N.
M. larsen with having injured him. l,ar
sen was found in the lodging house where
the trouble occurred and was taken into
custody. He will be held pending the re
sult of Kenney's wound.
According to the. Injured man he went
to the lodging house and shortly, after
ward engaged in a dispute with Larsen,
who was employed there as a bed maker.
Words led to blows and the bed maker
losing his temper picked up a cuspidor
and hurled it at Kenney. striking him in
the forehead. As the blood spurted from
the wound Kenney at once repaired to the
Receiving Hospital, where the cut was
stitched. Subsequently he was taken to
th< City Prison and charged with battery.
The following day he was released on
bonds furnished by two friends.
After returning home Kenney complain
ed of severe pains in his head! and at his
request a doctor was sent for. An exam
ination revealed the fact that the wound
had become infected, presumably owing
to his being confined in the City Prison.
Larsen admits indicting the wound, but
says that he threw the cuspidor in de

As he is much the stronger man, and a.s I

MISSIONITES
DENOUNCE THE
FRANCHISE STEAL
Continued From Page One.
one passed Saturday night by the Fed
eration of Mission Improvement Clubs,
was read and adopted unanimously by
a standing vote. It protests against
the passage of the double-track ordi
nance, calls upon the Supervisors to
order the tearing up of the present sin
gle-track line across the streets of the
city so that the railroad company will
be compelled to run over its bay shore
right of way, and demands that no
franchises be granted to transportation
companies until the new charter goes
into effect.
The matter of a defense fund was
brought to the attention of the meet
ing by the chairman. He said that it
might be necessary tn carry the mat
'cr into the courts and it would be
necessary to engage U'gal talent which
cost money. No action was taken on
the suggestion at the time, but It is un
derstood that it will be part of the
business for the n*^xt meeting.
Short addresses in line with the reso
lutions already adopted and the senti
ments expressed in the letter to the
Supervisors were made by P. Harring
ton, J. P. Tuohey, F. T. Meagher,
George L. Center, F>. D. Sullivan and
A. B. Maguire. Mr. Harrington was
very forcible in his remarks.
"I think the time has arrived," he
said, "that, we should let the people of
the Mission and the city at large know
that we are not asleep. I think it is
time that the people should take the
matter into their own hands and or
ganize a vigilance committee as they
did in the early days. This idea of go
ing down to the Supervisors on our
bellies and asking them to do so and
so is all played out. We have been too
easy altogether. Tf the people. of the
Mission would do as the people of Chi
cago did and take a rope to them
things might be different."
Upon the subsidence of the loud ap
plause that followed these remarks of
Mr. Harrington, A. B. Maguire intro
duced the following resolution:
Whereas. The Market Street Rail
way Company has applied to the
Board of Supervisors for various
franchises covering many of the,
streets of our city; and whereas, said
railroad company now holds many
franchises which it uses but In parts
and for its own convenience and profit
and disregarding the rights of the peo
ple; and whereas, said railway com
pany has proven in the past to be
false to many of the promises it has
made to the people when applying for
franchises; ana whereas, the new
charter adopted by a vote of our peo
ple expressly states that It is the pur
pose of the city to acquire its public
utilities; and whereas, the revenues to
the city will be largely Increased from
franchises granted under the condi
tions of the charter as compared with
the picayune percentage required by
the present law. therefore be. it
Resolved, That all the people of
the Mission protest against any fran
chise being granted at the present,
and particularly against any fran
chise being granted to this pledge
breaker, the Market Street Railway
Company.
Paul Barblerl, who appeared last
week before the Street Committee rep
resenting the Montgomery block, and
advocated the granting of a franchise
to the "corkscrew" line, askod and was
granted permission to speak to the
meeting as a property-owner in the
Mission. He said that he represented
property-owners in other sections of
the city, who were desirious that a
cross-town electric line should be
built. He contended, therefore, that
such a resolution as had just been of
fered would antagonize residents of
other sections of the city to the aims
of the Missionites, for which reason he
asked them not to pass it, but to stick
to the fight against the double-track
franchise, in which they would find
they had no antagonism. The position
taken by Mr. Barbieri did not seem to
suit the humor of the meeting, so E.
P. E. Troy offered the following
amendment to the resolution, it being
intended to remove the objection
named:
â¢â Resolved, That we favor the cross
town road under the provisions of the
new charter."
By this time a number of those pres
nf-t had arrived at the conclusion that
the purposes for which the meeting
was called were being transcended, and
a point of order was raised to the in
troduction of the resolution. The chair
considered the point well taken, and
Mr. Rarbicri was compelled to break
off his remarks. It was decided a few
moments later, however, that the reso
lution, minus the amendment, which
was withdrawn, would be taken up
after the meeting had decided on the
course of action to be taken in the
fight against the double tracks.
After addresses as to the best meth
ods to pursue, it was agreed that a pro
test against the double-track fran
chise drawn up by Secretary E. D. Sul
livan should be adopted and that a
committee of ten to be appointed by
the chair, should present it to the Su
pervisors. On motion of I. J. Dwyer it
was voted that all present at the meet
ing should sign. It was also decided, by
a rising vote, that those in attendance
should join with the committee of ten
in calling upon the Supervisors.
The delegation will be at the City
Hall this afternoon at 2 o'clock. The
chair named the following gentlemen
as the committee of ten: George Wal
com, William Watson, Oustave
Schnee, A. R. Maguire, George I* Cen
ter. J. J. Green, F. J. Mitchell, Max
Popper, J. J. Clark and F. T. Meagher.
The meeting then adjourned to meet
again next Sunday afternoon at Man
gels Hall, when, it was announced, a
defense ftind would be started to carry
the fight to the courts If necessary.
AIGELTINGER SAYS SO.
Expects to Pass to Print The
Two Infamous Resolutions.
Supervisor Aigeltinger. chairman of
the Street Committee and the recog
nized leader of the solid, seven, says
that the double track and the blanket
franchises asked for by the Southern
Pacific and the Market Street Railway
will be passed to print this afternoon.
"I expect we will pass the ordinances j
;to print," he said last night. "Why j
â¢ should we not grant these franchises? j
! There is no opposition to them from i
i the representative men of the city â the i
. men who employ labor and who own j
property that will be effected. After i
: the franchises are granted I shall be in j
â  favor <>f passing an ordinance compell- :
I ing the street railway companies to put ',
down nat rails, doing away entirely
: with 'T' rails, and also to take up all
I tracks that are not in use.
"The meeting held to-day to protest ;
against granting the Southern Pacific j
: the right to lay double tracks over its .
right of way through the city was not i
i a protest of property owners. It was i
j got up in the political interest of j
Phelan. I do not propose to be fright- i
ened by such people, but if any man ;
! of standing in the community will show I
tne why the franchises should not be
granted I will change my vote and help j
defeat the ordinances. This is not a \
question of favoring any railroad, hut :
a question of acting for the best inter- !
esta of thf* city. The street railroad!
companies who are asking for these
franchises have declared that they in- ;
tend to begin work at once, and that
means work for a great many unem- i
ployed men. The street railways are
needed to develop the city and the
work is needed by hundreds of men out j
of employment. If I cannot produce a
property owner who favors the grant
} ing of these franchises for every prop
-. erty owner opposed to them I will do-
I nate a thousand dollars to the chari
table institutions of this city."

AN OLD MAN
BADLY BEATEN
BY A SAILOR
Vicious Attack Upon
Martin Jackson.
HIS RECOVERY IS DOUBTFUL
THE ASSAILANT CHARGED WITH
ASSAULT TO MURDER.
Fled From the House, but Was
Found Hiding Under a
Wagon by Officer
Cavanaugh.
Martin Jackson, who conducts a lodg
ing house at 9<M Koarny street, was so
badly beaten yesterday morning by Geo.
Ford that he may die.
About six months ago Jackson bought
out the New Avenue House on Kearnj^
street and up to yesterday there hns been
no trouble In the building. Early yester
day morning Officer J. B. Cavanaugh,
while patrolling his beat, was startled by
screams of agony proceeding from the
house. He rushed toward the place and
when nearing the door saw a man run
ning from the building. I'avanaugh gave
chase and found his man cowering under
a wagon in a little cul-de-sac running off
Kearny street. He called for assistance
and was joined by Officer Peters and the
two escorted the prisoner back to the
lodging house. At the head of the stairs
they found Jackson lying senseless in a
pool of blood near a little room he uses
as an office. When raised up he regained
consciousness lon"g enough to tell his
story and request that he be taken home
at once. He claims that shortly after
3 o'clock he furnished Ford and a friend,
who was accompanied by a lady, with
rooms. A few minutes later he found
Ford attempting to gain entrance to the
room occupied by the couple. Jackson
remonstrated with him whereupon Ford
struck him In the head, knocking him
down. Not satisfied with this, Ford
rained blow alter blow upon the lodging
house keeper until he had beaten him Into
a state of insensibility.
Jackson was taken in a carriage to the
<"ity Receiving Hospital, where several
ugly wounds about the head and body
were dressed. Later he w;is taken to Ms
home at 24 Turk street, and L>r. Graves,
the family physician, summoned.
Ford was taken to the California Street
Police Station and locked up on a charge
of assault to commit murder. He gave
his age as 24 and his occupation as a
sailor.
Officers f'nvanaugh and Peters, who
made the arrest, are of the opinion that
Ford use,! brass knuckles. His hand la
cut just as it would be had he used a
badly fitting pair of knuckles.
Jackson is over 60 years of age and his
recovery Is very doubtful. Last night hy
again lapsed into an unconscious condi
tion, and the doctor says that he has
about an even chance with death.

ONE SECRET
WEDDING LED
TO MOTHER
Mrs. Dam's Niece Is
Now a Bride.
MISS COOPER'S ROMANCE
ELOPED TO REDWOOD CITYWITH
DAVID RAND.
An Oakland Society Belle Takes a
Minister With Her in Case One
Could Not Readily Be
Found.
Oakland Office San Francisc Call!
908 Broadway. May 28. I
Society has been surprised to learn that]
1 of one elopement within ltsl
charmed circle a few days ago there w-ti-I
second uni onv< ntional couplel
aiimit that they were lÂ»*d into the secret
marriage practice by the example of the
others.
M â ..-â  M rrtle Cooper and Mr. David Rand
were secretly wedded at Redwood City on
April 8, and although they confessed to
their relatives a couple of days later
their friends bave only recently learned
of thy romantic trip tv San Mateo
County.
"So It's out at last, is it?" said the
petite bride last nipht. "We have been
expecting to read of our escapade for
many weeks past. It was a trille ro
mantic, of course; secret weddings al
ways are. You remember that a short
time apj Frank Gowil! announced that
he had been married at' Brentwood to
Miss Champlin. Well, they were close!
frien<l- md their example did not j
seem to be such a bad one at all. Dave j
and I hail been supposed to be engaged |
for over a year, and we thought it would |
be such fun to go and do likewise. One i
Saturday a few weeks ago we made up |
our minds to make the venture. We have
a friend )â¢!â¢â¢â a minister. Rev. A. W.
Culver bo we persuaded him to come
along with us to do the marrying. You
see, we wanted a church wedding and I
micht Dot be able to rind a minister on \
call. We went to Redwood City and were
married in the Presbyterian church there.
Rev, Mr. Wade Btood .up with us. and I
think he rather doubted my being of
legal age, but I wa* is six months ago.
A lady named Mrs. Dodge was pressed
Into se: vi< c as a witness, and the whole
thing was soon concluded. It was infin
itely better than having half a thousand
people stare at you while being married.
We kept it a secret till the next Monday
and then we told our relatives. A little
later Dave took a very formal little para
graph to a local paper, but no one sus- i
pected that it was us, but I really think
It is about time now that my friends I
cease to call me Miss Cooper. We haye 1
lived with Mr. Rand's mother and j
there aÂ«* not two happier people alive."
Mrs. Hand is the niece of Mrs. Cyrus '
Dam. and has lived with the Dams many I
years, her parents both being dead. She j
"is a graduate of California College and I
recently made her debut as an elocution- j
Ist, having studied under Mrs. Carrie
Fross-Synaer. In church circles she is j
very popular, and was chaperoned by
Mrs. Dam whenever she appeared in so
cJety.
The bride is a petite blonde of a bright i
disposition that wins friends for her i
wherever nhe goes. She is very talented,
and in public has made a very favorable
impression In histrionic art. It has been
said that on the stage she would make a
ran.- success.
David H. Rand is with the Realty Syn
dicate in San Francisco and his home ia
on Twenty-sixth street in this city. He j
is live years his bride's senior and has a |
private' fortune.
"I think we did just right." he says.
"Miss Cooper is not any fonder of being
made conspicuous than 1 am. We are
young and I have to make my way in |
the world, and 1 thought we could make \
a far hotter investment than frittering ;
away a few hundred dollars on a fash
ionable wedding that we would not have !
t-njoyed half so much. I suppose after i
this we shall give a reception, and then j
1 want tv be forgotten."
A POLICE MYSTERY
FINALLY CLEARED UP
MELVILLE STATELER THOUGHT
HE WAS IN TROUBLE,
ALAMEDA, May 28.â T. Melville State
ler. son of T. K. Stateler. the railroad
man, has been laboring under the Im
pression for two weeks that he had either
maimed or killed Police Office Brampton.
For the same length of time the local
Police Department has been deploring its
ill luck in allowing to slip through its
fingers what was supposed to be a much
wanted bicycle thief!
One night about two weeks ago, when
the police wore attempting to enforce, the
bicycle lantern ordinance, Officer Bramp
ton sighted a llghtless wheel going along
Railroad avenue, near Willow stfeet. The
offlci r hastened to the middle of the street
to bead oft" the wheelman. The bicycle
rider did not surrender, lie? let out a link
or two of his legs and ran into Brampton
at full speed. While the officer was disen
tangling himself from the broken spokes
the rider of the machine disappeared in
the darkness.
The bicycle was taken to the City Pris
on, where the learned heads of the de
partment â  got toother and reached the
conclusion that the prize had been stolen
and that the man whom Brampton missed
was the thief. Despite diligent search no
owner was found for the wheel.
Last night T. Melville Stateler visited
the police station, proved that the wheel
was his and admitted that he was riding
it when it had such a violent meeting
with Brampton. The voting man thought'
at the time that ho had kelled the officer
and fearing severe punishment has kept
out of sight ever since. Only yesterday
he learned that Brampton was none the
worse for the collision. He sought an in
terview with Chief Conrad and when he
was informed that be had not been
charged with any offense he immediately
claimed his wheel.
Young Stateli r gained considerable no
toriety a short time ago by the announce
ment of his secret marriage to a Miss
Jacobson and the divorce proceedings
which followed.
WESTERN IMPROVEMENTS
Richmond and Sunset Valley Making
Rapid Strides in Progressive
Measures.
Richmond by the Bea will not be called
upon to plead guilty to sloth and indif
ference in trying to advance the prosper
ity ot" the healthful suburban section of
the city.
The progress made in grading and mac
adamizing streets and connecting side
si wera with main leaders has been the
means of keeping Contractor Felix Mc-
Hugh busy with his gang of workmen.
â  This line of improvement indicates the
: fact that the building of houses is going
on. for it is a recognized fact that If no
homes are being erected there is no ne
cessity for progressive measures in get
ting streets and sewers in good condition.
Real estate transfers and notice of
â  buildings have been signified during the
past week as follows: Southeast corner
of Eighth avenue and Clement street, lot
25x107 feel, with old house; sold from the
Hibernla Savings and Loan Society to W.
IC. Bollington for $1900. On Second aye-
nue, 150 feet south of Point Lobos. lot S x
I'Â»> feet, for $675. One-half block fronting
600 feet on the east .side of Tenth avenue,
between C and D streets, for $15,750. A
big sale is recorded carrying a piece of
property on which will be erected, the
Richmond < '.or.gregational church, on the
< orner of Seventh avenue and Clement
Btreet, for $40,000.
The postponement of awarding the con
tract for the regrading of Twenty-fourth
avenue, between A and B streets, has
brought forth a protest from the execu
tive committee of the Point Lobes Im
provement Club, in which it offers a pur
gestion in the following language: "That
the Street Committee will award the said
contract at its next meeting, as the ave
nue has been graded and macadamized
once, but through the shortsightedness
of the property-owners the street has
asain become impassable, both to pedes
trians and vehicles, and we hope the
Street Committee will not allow this
necessary work to go by default."
Following this request the committee,
through Its chairman, James \V. Wllklns,
requests the placing of electric lights at
the following places: Sixth avenue and
Lake street. Seventh avenue and A
street; Seventh avenue and Clement
street; Twentieth avenue and Clement
street; Twenty-second avenue and Cali
fornia Street; Twentieth avenue and Lake
street, and that the lights be ex
tended from Thirty-first avenue and Point
Lobos avenue to the Cliff House and along
the road from t~he Cliff House to the in
tersection of the ocean beach and A
street.
The south side of the park, or the Sun
set Valley, not to be outdone by Its neigh
bor in the Richmond, is in the progres
sive van and has more transfers of realty
than any other section of similar area.
Whether through necessity or otherwise,
the Market Street Railroad Company has
been instrumental in advancing real es
tate valuation by its numerous electric
branches. The continuation of the Stan
van street electric line from Haight to
I'arna-Â«sus avenue and along that thor
oughfare to and directly in front of the
Affiliated Colleges opens up a new sec
tion of territory surpassed by none other
in the city as choice building lots.
The completion of the much-needed
leading sewer running east and .west
through the center of the valley Mas
given the householders a long sought for
opportunity to protect their homes in a
sanitary measure. This, together with
the introduction of electric lights and ad
ditional water mains, has made the resi
dents realize that they command some
share of the City Fathers' affections.
The most important movement, how
ever, to give the Sunset Valley an im
petus for wider usefulness is the contem
plated extension of Nineteenth avenue
south from Golden Gate Park at the ba3e
of Sweeny's Observatory to Ingleside,
connecting with the Ocean House and
Dewey boulevard.
There is one matter, however, that has
1 annoyed the property owners, and this is
: that the work commenced two years ago
! on Seventh avenue has been left in an
! unfinished condition south of the pond.
This roadway was intended to connect
] with Dewey boulevard at the Almshouse
tract, but for some unassigned reason the
work stopped as soon as the Dewey boule
vard end was completed.

TOE SA:N FEANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 29, 1899.
USED A KNIFE
TO AVENGE HIS
COUSIN'S WRONGS
"Joe" O'Brien Stabs
George Faust.
RESULT OF A FAMILY ROW
THE INJURED MAN SPIRITED
AWAY BY RELATIVES.
Had Been Secretly Married to
O'Brien's Cousin and Was Ac
cused of Treating His Bride
Cruelly.
ALAMEDA, May 2S.â A family row
I which started some months ago through
j the secret marriage of George Faust of
j Petaluma and Miss Lucy O'Brien of Ala
: meda. culminated last night in the serious
i cutting of Faust by a man known as
I" "Joe" O'Brien, who is a cousin of the
woman. The cutting occurred near the
home of James Walker, 2140 Encinal ave
nue, who is married to a sister of Mrs.
Faust.
As near as can be learned Faust and
O'Brien have not been priori friends since
the former visited Jhe O'Brien home at
: HO.'i Court street and announced to the j
family that he was Miss Lucy's husband j
and that they had been married for sev
eral months. O'Brien, the cousin. Inter
fered at the time and demanded that
Faust produce bettor evidence of the
marriage ceremony than his unsupported
word. The girl subsequently left her
home, and has since been living with her
husband.
Of late reports have reached the family
that Faust had not been treating his
wife properly, and Cousin O'Brien deter
mined to interfere in the woman's behalf.
In the meantime Mrs. Walker had taken
an active interest in the trouble, siding
with Faust as against her sister and
cousin Joe. She told Faust that the cous
in was actuated in his course by Jealousy,
and that as a matter of fact he was in
love with Lucy. This statement stirred
up Faust. He left the Walker home last
night in search of O'Brien at the same
time that O'Brien departed from Court
street on a still- hnut for Faust. Mrs.
Anna O'Brien, the mother-in-law, accom
panied her nephew, while Walker went
: with Faust. The family meeting occurred
'} on Encinal avenue, near Park street.
O'Brien and Faust did the talking. The
former is a man of slender build, while
i Faust is fully six feet tall and broad
shouldered. After some words between
j the men they were seen to clinch, and sud
denly Faust staggered away with bis
hands clasped to his left side. He was
assisted from the place by Walker, who
took him to his home at 2140 Encinal
avenue, where he was secreted.
Dr. W. I* Friedman attended the
wounded man.
"I was called last night about 10 o'clock
to 2140 Encinal avenue to attend a man
suffering from a severe knife wound."
said the doctor. "The cut extended from
his left armpit for a distance of eight or
ten inches across the body over the heart.
The flesh was cut down to the ribs. I
took twelve stitches in the wound. The
only thing that saved the man's life was
the fact that the knife was drawn diag
onally across the ribs."
Joe O'Brien, who wielded the knife, ac
knowledged that he was the party who
had done the cutting, and that his cous
in's husband was the victim.
"I cut Faust in self-defense," said
O'Brien. "He struck me. and then I,
being the smaller man, stabbed him. I
do not care to discuss the matters that
led up to the trouble. To do so It would
be necessary to go into unsavory family
secrets. I am not in love with my cous
in, and am not Jealous of her, but I want
to see her treated properly."
Faust was a member of Company C of
Petaluma, and enlisted under, the name
of James Connelly. He met Miss O'Brien
while the volunteers were stationed at
Camp Barrett. They were secretly mar
ried in San Francisco last December.
After the troops were mustered out Faust
informed Mrs. O'Brien that he was her
son-in-law. A scene followed the an
nouncement, and there has been trouble
In the family ever since.
BEN TRUMAN ARRIVES.
Ben Truman of Los Angeles, the Com
missioner to the Paris Exposition, ar
rived last night and is a guest at the Oc
cidental.
"I have been accused of desiring the
secretaryship of the commission," he said
las.t night, "but that is untrue. When I
heard that Mr. Runyon was appointed,
and knowing his capacity and ability, I
wished him to take the position, thinking
up to that time one of the commission
would act as secretary. As soon as i
learned that the other Commissioner
wished to appoiint a secretary I wrote
to Mr. Foote, telling him of my willing
ness to make the appointment of Mr.
Gasklll unanimous.
"I have no plans as yet. We will organ
ize this morning."
Poisoned by Morphine.
The death of Mrs. Mary Hall, aged 68
years, residing at 4400 Eighteenth street,
was reported to the Coroner yesterday by
Dr. Felipe Martinez, 300 Powell street. It
was stated that the deceased was suffer
ing with cancer and, in order to alleviate
her sufferings, a previous physician who
had been attending her had administered
morphine. A portion of this drug had
been- left in her room and she took an
overdose of it during the night, whether
with suicidal intent or not is not known.
Her niece, Mrs. Riley, found her in a
comatose condition at 9 o'clock yesterday
morning and at once sent for her physi
cian, Dr. Martinez, who did all in his
power to restore her to consciousness, but
without avail. She died at 3 o'clock, in the
afternoon.
In the absence of Coroner Hill Deputy
McCormick permitted the body to remain
at the residence.
A Phelan Club Organized.
A largely attended meeting of the James
D. Phelan Club of the Thirty-ninth As
sembly District was held at Saratoga Hall
on Friday evening. Permanent officers
were elected as follows: W. P. Adams,
chairman; Frank Mann, first vice chair
man; Dr. 1. W. O'Rourke, second vice
chairman; Henry M. Owens, recording
secretary; W. P. Carter, correspond! hk
secretary; Oscar Hocks, treasurer; Louis
Ratigan. sergeant at arms.
A campaign committee of nine members
from each primary election precinct was
appointed by the chairman. A resolution
was adopted making it the sense of the
club that the apportionment, when made,
should be by primary election precincts.
A committee, composed of Dr. Henry
Flockensteln, Joseph M. Kinley, John A.
Fenton, W. P. Adams and Henry M.
Owens, was -selected to confer with like
committees of other clubs for the pur
pose of organizing a James D. Phelan
League of Clubs.
Accused of Theft.
Charles Jonas, a respectable appearing
man. was arrested last night and charged
with petty larceny. Jonas bought a gal
lery ticket for the Orpheum, but as the
place was crowded he was told to go to
the box office, where the money would be
refunded. There were a number of other
men clamoring, for the return of their
money and, according to one of them,
Jonas picked up 20 cents which was com
ing to him and attempted to leave the
place.
Notwithstanding Jonas' protestations of
innocence he was arrested and charged
with petty larceny. On learning the facts
. Judge Mogan promptly released him on
1 his own recognizance.

ThÂ« Mining King's Wife Makes an
Appointment to Meet a Sharper,
but Her Brother Informs
the Police.
Mrs. Gates, the wife of "Swlftwater
Bill," the far-famed Klondike king, fell
Into the hands of the bunko fraternity
rday. She was not a victim, however,
owing to the k> ,ii detective qualities of
lu-r brother, George La More, ;<nd the In
tervention of Dot. .'lives Wren and Mc-
Mahon, but she is probably the wiser on
"froren north" exiurters anil grafters.
Yesterday afternoon an individual well
known tv the police, seedy Id appearance
ami purporting to have Just arrived from
Daws< n City, rapped at the door of Mis.
La More, the mother of Mrs. Gates, who
live* in the Mission. He Informed her
!:â  had a letter for her daughter
from "Swiftwater" and desired to deliver
It. Mrs. La More became Interested and
â  d to a wonderful romance of the
extraordinary fortune, in which
In- stated that his .irtus were Bore from
carrying a Back of gold dust 4<Xw miles,
he had just deposited in the United
3 Mint. The unsuspecting woman
him her daughter's address and Bent
for her son. who contemplates leaving I'or
the treasure land next month, that he
imbibe some ol the valuable In
formation which her visitor was Impart
ing. The Btranger departed after having
ded an Invitation to young l-;i More
to dine with him at the Palace Hotel at ;
ck.
The grafter lust no time in seeking his
victim, lie related to her substantially
:no tale .is he had t < >lcl tv her motb
ike of a dearth of pocket mon
ey while the valuable dust w;ts awaiting
the melting pot In the mint. Surveying
her luxurious parlor and the delicate tea
gown which adorned her, he passed com
plimentary remarks upon her good taste
and offered to purchase her JlOtK) worth
imonds If Bile would only consent to â 
picking them out. He asked other pertl
ibout her possessions and
d to extend ln-r a loan 11" she desired
when he received his wealth to-day. Be- ;
fore taking his leave he made an appoint
meni to meet her last evening at 9 o'clock.
Mrs. Gates entertained no suspicions of
her caller and prepared to receive htm at
the appointed hour and hear more of the :
burning of Dawson City and the picking
up of treasure In the Klondike.
Meanwhile, George La More, â¢ thinking
fellow might be spurious, went
i.. the Palace Hotel he had Riven the
name of Slongberger, hut do such party
was at that hostelry and the disappointed â 
t I started out on hi.- trail. On reach- j
Ing his Bister's house he found that the
bunco man had already left, and when be
learned of the appointment he resolved
I the police with the facts. Ac- ;
gly about 8 '>'e!(,<-k last evening he !
vis) ed Captain Bohen at the Central Po- ;
lice Station and told him the story. Ku
hen placed the case in the hands of De- I
tectivee Wren and McManon and they
Btarted with young La More to cage the
bird.
Their prey made ii is appearance on
tini" .i! the house. The detectives, who
were in hiding, landed on him and sm.hi
discovered his personality. They could
make no arrest as the man had not vet
extorted any money*, but sent him on his,
way Borrowing, after having given him ;
:â¢Â» leave the city. The fellow is j
known to the police as the â 'Klondike Bor- ;
rower," and has victimized scores tof peo- '
pie in San Francisco. Mis "graft" is usu
ally along the same lines employed in this
instance, bui he usually succeeus in mak- \
â - loan from his victims on the (
_th of a mythical sack of gold which j
is temporarily out of his possession.

IN MEMORY
OF THE
HE ROIS
DEAD
FORESTALLING the calendar by
two days, the ministers observed
Memorial day yesterday and last
evening instead of to-morrow.
In nearly every church some
reference was made to the day and its
observance, and in a great many the
entire service was dedicated to the na
tion's dead. The members of the Grand
Army were present by invitation at
several of the services, and the spirit
of the day brought more than usual
through the church doors.
The day has an added significance
this year. There are new mounds be-
side the old ones; the sexton is busy
with pick and spade, for there are more
mounds to raise, and the war in the
Philippines is adding to his labors day
by day. Time has made the day one of
solemnity and sorrow, but the sting of
grief has been dulled and the flowers
strewn upon the grave spoke more of
honored memory than of mourning.
But now it is different The reaper's
harvest has been rich t>f late: there are
otliers beside those of "61 seeking a
place in the country's mourning, and
there are those who pass by the graves
they have decorated so long for pa
triotism to seek out a new-made
mound and weep over it by themselves.
In view of these altered conditions
the day will be more important and
more extensively observed than it has
been. Custom has made it more of a
holiday for the living than a time of
mourning for the dead and a lesson of
patriotism for those who enjoy what
they purchased with their blood. Be
sides. California has slept so long in
peace that it is hard for her to wake
to the realities of war; but with one
regiment of her sons at the front and
two more only just out of the nation's
service, the meaning of Memorial day
Is brought home more forcibly than in
years gone by, and the people are look-
Ing upon it more in the light of what
it is than what they have been pleased
to make it. Heretofore its celebration
has been left to the Grand Army and
its kindred organizations; It wijl be the
saiiv- this year. >>ut they have the heart
and interest of the great mass of the
public with themâ something, perhaps,
they have not been used to.
To-morrow the civic celebration will
be held. There will be un Imposing
parade and there will be services in
both the National and the Odd Fel
luws" cemeteries. The'big parade will
start from the corner of Battery and
Market streets at 10 o'clock. The ex
ercises will follow at the Odd Fellows'
Cemetery as soon as the column ar
rives there. At the Presidio the parade
Will start from the terminus of th^
Union-street cars at 10 o'clock.
AT THE FIRST
CONGREGATIONAL
George H. Thomas Post, G. A. R., at
tended special memorial services in the
First Congregational Church last even
ing. The interior of the edifice was ap
propriately decorated for the occasion,
American flags Being prominently dis
played on the platform back of the speak
er's desk, which was flanked on either
Bide by stacked' army rifles. The members
of the post attended in a body, marching
into the church and down the central aisle
while the Inspiring strains of a fife and
drum corps at their head resounded
through the auditorium. It was an im
pressive spectacle as the veterans slowly
tiled into the seats assigned to them with
the martial music ringing in their ears.
The services opened with a special song
service of patriotic music, the audience
singing "Where Are the Boys of the Old
Brigade?" "Tenting on the Old Camp
Ground," "Soon With the Angels I'll He
Manning," and other war-time melodies.
Rev. Dr. G. C. Adams, the pastor, took
for his text the sixth verse, 12& d Psalm,
"Pray for peace, Jerusalem: they shall
prosper that love thee,." "While my text
speaks of Jerusalem it is not of Jerusalem
Itself that I intend to speak to-night," he
said. "Jerusalem was God's country and
this is God's, country. He made it allâ
these grand mountains- and these lovely
valleys". He created this continent and
then locked it up until he had a civiliza
tion prepared to inherit it." Dr. Adams
said: : ." â :â¢
You did not realize when you enlisted In
1861 that you were enlisting to wipe out some
thing that was a menace to the progress of
Christianityâ you thought only that you were
enlisting to battle for the flag. On the same
day that the pilgrims landed on the now
famous Plymouth Rock, a Dutch vessel en
tered the James River and landed twenty negro
slaves on the soil of Virginia. The Dutch were
responsible for the Introduction of the great
evil into this country and grand old England,
much as we love her, was responsible for keep-
Ing up the practice and fostering It. Queen
Elizabeth herself was a party to the traffic
In slavesâ ln fact she was personally Interested
In the business. Even good old Governor John
Winthrop of Massachusetts willed a number
of Indians to his heirs, and a church mem
ber of Boston owned the ship that made the
most successful voyage to bring slaves to this
country. If slavery had been profitable in New
England you would n..t have enlisted In '61.
It did not prove profitable there and you can
trust a Yankee every time to turn over a new
leaf when It Is to his profit.
The hand of God Is seen all through the
great struggle. Why WU General Albert Sid
ney .lohnstone struck down at Pittsburg Land
ingâa man who had the respect and confl
! den.-c of the entire Houth? "Why did Stonewall
Jackson fallâ shot, unfortunately, by his own
men at ChancelloraviHe, and cause Lee to ex
claim after Gettysburg, "oh, for a Jackson."
It was the work of God. Hut it was the
blood of the thousands of Northern and South
ern men slain In that war that cemented the
union. You never dreamed that "Fighting Joe"
Whaler would get off his sick bed In the hos
pital and compel them to carry him forward
to the front to fight under the stars and
stripes. You never dreamed that Fltzhugh I^ee
would grit his teeth and BtruKgle through all
he had to contend with a little over a year
ago in Havana for the flag he once fought
against. We thank" God that there Is no longer
a North or a Kouth; that the curse of slavery
that once threatened our national existence has
been wiped out and that we are once more
brothers and citizens of "God's chosen land.
AT HOWARD STREET
METHODIST CHURCH
At the Howard-street Methodist Epis
copal Church last night live posts of the
Cirand Army of the Republic were repre
sented. Five hundred seats were reserved
for them and a great crowd was in attend
ance. The pastor, Rev. Dr. John A. B.
Wilson, said:
As I look Into your faces I seem to bear
asaln the drumbeat of '61. A boy ef Yd, 1 i, .
member the call of the country to arm?. The I
Btory of Fort Sumter had lx-pn told and the ,
young manhood of the land forsook their plows, j
their shops, their merchandise, their professions '
and ralllpd to the standard of the union, un<l
stayed by their work until every star was r.
stored to Its field of azure. At last they came j
back, but not all of them; by hundreds of i
thousands they left their bodies in Southern ;
soil. They died, but the Ideas for which they
contended live â African slavery forever ob- â 
lltorated and the unity of the nation preserved. J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, MAY 29, 1899.
! And thirty-seven years after William Shafter
I and Joe Wheeler, General Wilson and General
I Breckinridge. uvon the same battlefield and
| under the same flag, led troops from North and
South, both white and black, upon a foreign
soil In a campaign of mercy for the- higher
civilization of the world, while the sons of
I Vermont and Maryland, Dewey and Schley,
I swept two oceans with their flags and by the
i thunders of their great guns blew from the
j seas the medieval misrule of Spain. We are
i no longer a province, but a nation, whose
' mighty Christian influence the powers of the
j world must reckon with. Afid even- Samoa can
not be Germanized or Anglicized, nor China
I dismembered without our consent.
But our present recognition by the nations of
the world and our present ability to handle
. the lever of aggressive civilization was made
a possibility by the men who from 'til to '65
poured out their lives to make a free nation
I a unit forever.
In April, ISOI. at the breaking out of the
wÂ«r, the Seventh New York militia were
: ordered t.. Washington to defend the capital.
When their train readied Philadelphia, they
learned that below Havre de Grace, Mil., the
railroad had been destroyed by the Confed
erates or then- friend?. They accordingly took
the steamer Boston at Philadelphia and pro
ceeded down the Delaware River, out upon
the Atlantic Ocean, to Cape Henry, up the
Chesapeake Bay to Annapolis, Md., at which
point they found the Eighth Massachusetts, in
command of Colonel Benjamin F. Butler.
They learned that the track between there and
Baltimore and Washington ha 4 been destroyed.
including three bridges, and eight locomotives
had been dismantled and their parts piled in
one confused heap in the roundhouse. I'pon
the rehabilitation of these engines and the re
pairing of tracks and bridges the fate ..i
Washington depended. Colonel Butler ordered
his men into line and gave the command:
"The men who understand the mechanism and
construction of a locomotive step six paces
to the front." Every officer and man of Com
pany E, recruited from the engine workers of
Taunton, Mass., stepped to the front, and in
one hour and twenty minutes engine No. 1748
was out on the track under tier own steam,
and in two hours and a half the others were
ready for service and the Seventh New York
:<ud a part of the Eighth Massachusetts were
off on their way to the capital. When they
came to the broken bridges a similar call pro
duced the requisite pumber of bridge builders,
who. pulling two haniH to pieces in an in
credibly short time, bridged the chasm from
abutment to abutment, and in seven hours
from the time the first engine was run out
at Annapolis the two regiments were pulled
Into Washington. Senator Solomon Foote of
Vermont, who received them with tears of
Joy, said: "God bless you, boys. You have
saved the capital of your country." The bat
teries v! Confederate guns, ready to bombard
the capital, were limbered up and stole back
to "Dixie," recognizing that the day was lost,
not to soldiers of the republic but to the plain
men who as unromantic mechanics had served
their generation so faithfully that when the

were equal to the crisis.
And there never waH a time when an elec

has been with most of your comrades, and, so
it shall be with you. Now, after this, what
then? Another life is before us. And the
services of this are the seedlings of that.
Where will you spend eternity? If death ends
all, why s.-ek to perpetuate the memory of

There was a day when you came home and
victory was upon your banners and honor of

TRIBUTE TO OUR
SOLDIER DEAD
Rev. Frederick C. Lee of the California -
street Methodist Episcopal Church chose
for his subject last evening "Our Soldier
Dead." He said in part:
\\> have more craves to decorate this B<Hh
of May than we had a year ago. Five hundred
killed on the battlefield, five thousand z lain by
fevers and bad food. This evening in the quiet
of this sacred ulace and hour I twine three
wreaths of laurel far our heroes dead and I
gather a cluster of flowers rich and rare for our
heroes llvinK.
M\ first wreath I lay upon the last resting
place "f our nation's dea/1. I visit all the
eighty-seven national cemeteries, with their
825,000 graves, 147.000 marked "Unknown."
While the North. West and East gather at
Gettysburg and Greenwood the South at Ander-
Bonvtlle and Nashville, let North and South
Jcin voice and sons: and ping:
"No more shall .the war cloud sever.
Or the winding river run red.
We'll bury our anirer forever.
As we laurel the graves of our dead."
My second chaplet Is for the unburled dead.
Those who fell under Foote and Faxragut,
Porter and Pennock. Beaten down by the iron
hall from Fort Fisher and Jackson. Torn and
shattered bodies swept into the waters of the
Mississippi from New Orleans to VlcksbUTÃ.
The bleached bones that lie in ocean grave, all
the way from Cherbourg, off the coast of
France, where the Alabama went down, to the
Bwampa "f <'hickumauga. Into all the waters
of harbor, bay and river I lower this token of
prateful remembrance and gratitude.
HpanniiiÃ the three and thirty years that He
bft ween the fall of Richmond and the capture
Of i "Ã¼ba, between Appomattox and Manila Bay,
I Dlace my third garland upon the new made
sraves5 raves of our boyn who fought and fell at San
van Hill and Cavlte, Manila and Calumplt.
Again making a hiatus of the thirty-three
years I join the ranks of the boys of '61 and 'C7>
to the ranks of the boys of '98 and '09 and
present my cluster of fresh culled flowers to
the veterans of the Civil War and the men who
fought so well on land and sea against Spain
and are with us in the flesh to-day. In place

May theso wise nnd representative men sug
gest to their respective governments and to

plan by which arbitration can be brought
about; a great court of appeal be instituted,
before which all International difficulties can
be argued and arbitrated. May this congress
be the first step toward Inaugurating that day
when "Nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more."

THE BATTLES
OF THE LORD
To an audience whioh crowded Metro
politan Temple in every part Dr. Charles
Inward Locke of the Central Methodist
Church preacned last evening on "The
Battles of Peace." The text was I Sam.,
xviii:l7: "Fight the Lord's Battles." He
said in part:
In the midst nf the mingled Joy and sorrow
of this Memorial Sunday, when we think of
the achievements of the nation's fallen heroes,
Is It not opportune that we should consider
what victories we must win that we may be
worthy sons of honored sires?
If we were to take our stand to-night among
the monumented mounds of Chalmette, Ar
lington Heights or Gettysburg, and arouse the
sleeping warriors long- enough to ask them for
v message for this Memorial Sabbath, what
think you would be the simultaneous reply?
Doubtless It would come back to us in clear
est accents, "Be true to the principles for
which we fouuht and fell!"
The centuries have seen many Illustrious bat
tlefields. Marathon, Waterloo and Yorktown:
Ylcksburg, Gettysburg and Manila. But if the
home-returning admiral, the maker of an
epoch and the builder of a republic, should be
pressed with an inquiry as to the triumphant
culmination of all victories on sea and on land,
this gallant warrior and Christian would re
ply, "The elevation and purification of the in
dividual citizen!"
Therefore, soldiers, patriots and fellow citi
zens. I call your attention to new fields of
conquest and to some battles which must be
fought in times of peac>, when the portals of
the temple of Janus are closed; and I do no
Injustice to the achievements of the past, when
1 aver that the greatest battlefields of the
centuries will be found in times of peace, when
the sword has become a plowshare and the
drowsy cannon sleeps In its citadel.
We must struggle for national and interna
tional arbitration, and, finally, for the dis
armament of the nations of the world. The
arbitrament ot logic and love and diplomacy
must takÂ» the place of the barbarians of war.
Many savage customs inherited from pagan
ism and the past have disappeared under the
brighter glow of advancing civilization, but.
Low strange, that the most cruel and inhuman
â  : all ot these should have perpetuated its
bloody personality. The Peace Congress at
The Hague is an assembly of no mean signifi
cance and will prove as remarkable In Its re
sults as th- victory of Dewey's fleet In the
harbor of Manila.
In times of peace we must battle for the
extermination of the criminal class. But close
ly connected with the extinction of the criminal
dasa there must be the abolition of poverty
and the suppression of vice. Under the present
system the poor grow poorer and the rich
richer. The billionaire will be one of the possi
ble curses of the next century. A reconstruc
tion Is necessary and It Is inevitable. 'If it
does not come by evolution it will be pre
cipitated by revolution.
Again, the conquest of the cities â will be one
of the battlefields of the not distant future.
Altogether too long have the great centers of
population been held up by corrupt dema
gogues. The professional politician who feeds
at the public crib will have to earn an honest
living or go to prison, where many of them
belong. To meet the emergencies of the pres
ent and future the inculcation of true manhood
is necessary beyond all things else. The
church, the home and the public school must
be protectedâ these are the nrsenals of the
weapons of peace and the training schools of
the com Ins warriors who are to win laurels
beside which all past victories will fade In
importance.
('omrailes and fellow citizens, as we shall
strew flowers on the graves of the brave men
who were sacrificed for liberty let us lift our
eyes to the god of battles and ask for a double
portion of the spirit of these translated heroes,
that we may honor the opportunities which the
victories of the sixties have committed to our
care. Thank iJixl we are now a united people 1
Pcatte.r your garlands over the blue and the
grey. From the mountains of Vermont to the
savannas of Georgia, from the everelades of
Florida to the golden strands of California,
let a united nation in tears remember the past,
and. with shouts of triumph, press into the con
flicts of the present rind the future.
GARFIELD POST
MEMORIAL SERVICE
Probably no post memorip.l services
were ever better rendered In this city
than those of James A. Garfield Post last
Tuesday evening. Social Hall in the Al
cazar building was made resplendent with
bunting, silken flaps, flowers and ferns.
In front of the platform four chairs, dec
orated with floral tributes offered by com
rades and artistically arranged by the
loving hands of loyal women belonging to
Qarfield Relief Corps, renresented the
places made vacant by the deaths of Com
rades Paulsen, Emptage, Poppenberg and
Graham, which occurred during the past
twelve months. Over the vacant chairs
were the notes of ''Taps," the soldier's
last call, completely bordered by beautiful
flowers, and with other features made a
most impressive surrounding.
After an organ voluntary by F. G.
Rohner. the colors were introduced, the
entire assemblage showing its reverence
by standing and singing the "Ode to the
Flag," the words .and air being written
by Comrade Frank Elliott Myers. After
Comrade Crall read the records of those
dead a selection from "Maritana" was
nndered on the organ with flute and vio
lin Ã¼bli^atos by Comrade Peter Johnson
and his daughter Isabel.
A prayer by the chaplain was followed
by the male quartet, c. insisting of E. S.
Elkins, George Rice, W. < \ Stadfeld and
William Nellson, who sang "The Vacant
chair," and subsequently "Sleep, Com
rade, Sleep," and tin- "volunteer's Fare
well." Miss Johannsen played Handel's
"l.argo."
General Edward S. Salomon introduced
the orator of the evening. Dr. William
Rader, pastor of the Third Congregation
al Church.
Dr. Rader spoke of the magnificent mili
tary character of Grant, the genius of
Sherman, the dash of Sheridan, the
majesty of Hancock and the incomparable
character of Thomas. Of the volunteers
ho said those of the American army had
demonstrated by their Intelligence from
the days of Washington down to the pres
ent time that in their hands the destinies
of the entire country were, safe, particu
larly when depending on their valor. He
also paid an eloquent tribute to Julia
Ward Howe, Henry Ward Beecher and
Harriet Beecher Stowe, as being among
the un-uniformed soldiers who, by elO
quent service had rendered material sup
port in upholding the Stars and Stripes
during the Rebellion, and had done so
much in the cause of civilization.
C. M. SHORTRIDGE
AT ZION CHURCH
The memorial services at the Zion A.
M. B. Church, 805 Stockton street, were
conducted by Rev. T. Brown last evening.
The church was tastefully decorated with
national colors and flowers, and the choir
rendered patriotic music. Nearly every
seat in the .large edifice was occupied.
The address of the evening was deliv
ered by Senator Charles M. Shdrtridgo
and was very impressive and full of
strong points concerning- the emancipation
oÂ£ the. negro race. The subject handled
by the speaker was "What the Negro Did
to Secure His Freedom," but Shortridge
added that it might be more properly ex
pressed "VVh;it the Negro Did to Secure
the Safety of the United States." He r .-
feri*ed to the events of the war and
averred that the use of shaves as soldiers
should have been made by the (iovtrn
ment two years before it was. To this
delay he attributed the prolongation of
the war and an immense Useless sacrifice
'of life.
R. A. AND N. U.

SCALED THE
FENCE BUT WAS
FINALLY CAUGHT
Exciting Chase After a
Young Hoodlum.
STABBED A RESTAURANT MAN
Forced to surrender at the
point of a pistol.
Edward Hennessey Cuts William
Fowler at Harbor View Over
a Trivial Dispute â Victim
Will Recover.
William Fowler, the proprietor of a res
taurant at Harbor View Gardens, was
stabbed several times last night by Ed
ward Hennessey, a young man. Fowler
was severely cut about the face and head.
His assailant was arrested after an excit
ing- chase and locked up in the City Prison
on the charge of assault to commit mur
der.
Shortly after 9 o'clock Hennessey, who
was under the influence of liquor, en
tered Fowler's place of business and ac
costing one of the waiters asked him for a
sandwich. Hennessey represented that he
was connected with a morning paper and
that he was unable to buy anything to
eat, HP he had "blown in" what money he
had on his best girl. The waiter promtly
served him with a sandwich after cau
tioning him not to inform the proprietor.
A few minutes later Fowler walked into
the restaurant and seeing Hennessey
munching <>n the sandwich in front of the
bar requested him to take a seat.
"It didn't cost me anything," replied
Ib-nnessey. "I stood off the guy for it"
(pointing to the waiter). "Don't discharge
him," pleaded Hennessey. "He knows a
hungry man when he sees him."
As be became abusive Fowler started to
eject him, when Hennessey struck him
in the face. Fowler returned the attack
and succeeded in knocking down the ob
streperous visitor. After regaining his
feet Hennessey picked up a large knifo
which was lying on the table and cut
Fowler across the forehead and nose. He
also made a deep gash on the right cheek.
Fowler's screams for help attracted the
attention of several men and they ran to
his assistance. Hennessey immediately
dashed from the restaurant, followed by
his pursuers One of them overtook him,
and aa he attempted to arrest him Hen
nessey suddenly wheeled around and
made a lunge at'him with the knife. Evi
dently realizing- that he would not b^
taken without further bloodshed one of
the men lustily blew a police whistle.
In the meantime Hennessey climbed
over the fence on the east side of the gar
dens, and rushing into a^ vacant house
took refuge behind some empty barrels.
Policemen Ratten and Webster were In
formed of his place of concealment and
they proceeded to arrest him. Hennessey
at first showed a disposition to defy them,
but was finally induced to surrender at
the point of a pistol. He was then hand
cuffed and removed to the City Prison,
where he was formally charged.
The knife with which he did the cut
ting was booked aa evidence against him.
Fowler's wounds are not serious.
