MANILA, April 30 8:10 p. m.- 1
While it is the general expec- j
tat ion among Americans that j
the Filipino emissaries will re- I
turn with revised proposals
from General Antonio Luna. Major-
General Otis is not letting this pros
pect interfere with his preparations for
pushing the war. Yesterday he ordered
Major Genera] Lawton t<> return tv
Angat. a few miles northwest of Nor
zagarac and not to advance aggres- ; .
sively while the negotiations are pend- I
ing. General Mac Arthur is apparently j
acting **n the safne policy, but he is re
; pairing bridges and strengthening the j
; lines of his force, which is stretched j
' out with a four-mile front and within a
: quarter of a mile of the enemy.
__
Th. possibilities of peace are grati
fying to a great majority of the army, j
who have regarded the war as an un- '
. pleasant duty that must be performed |
according to American traditions.
Manila is cheeerful over the pros- |
pect of a return to normal life, though j
> there are skeptics who remark that a ;
*"truce would enable the insurgents to j
rest until the rainy season, upon which
they have been depending as an im- j
portant aid.
The prisoners report that there are |
75.000 refugees north of San Fernando.
This is not impossible, considering the i
thickly populated region which the |
Americans have cleared. It seems also
that smallpox is spreading among
them.
Th" so-called Filipino Congress will I
meeet at San Fernando morrow.
When I>ean C. Worcester of the |
United States Philippine Commission, j
who accompanied the Filipino emis
saries from Calumpit, said to Colonel '
Manuel Arguelles that the Americans I
v.erÂ«Â« under noi obligations to i train i
from fighting, the Filipino officer said: j
"Would ynij fight while we are discuss- j
ing terms of peace?"' ;
Mr. Worcester responded with the j
suggestion that an armistice would
give the Filipino leaders time, to es- j
cap , p ; _ â
'My God! Where would we escape .
to?" the Filipino exclaimed, referring j
in this to the menacing hostile tribes !
behind the Filipino lines.
Arguelles told the correspondent of |
the Associated Press that he was much j
L disappointed in the results of his mis- '
-â¢ion. He said also that Aguinaldo ex- j
peeted Llumpit to be the cemetery of |
the American army.
Lieutenant Colonel Wallace of the j
First Montana Regiment. Major Adams
and Major Shields, who slept on Fri
day night in General Luna's camp,
where they went to inform the Fili- j
rinos that their envoys would return j
in safety, found the Filipino command- j
er cordial, the Filipino troops remov- j
ing their hats as the Americans passed. i
The Filipinos complained to them that!
the Americans used explosive bullets, j
which is not the fact. The American
officer retorted that the copper shells
used by the Filipinos are worse than
explosive bullets. General Luna said i
he, regretted being obliged to kill
Americans, but that that was his busi
ness. General Wheaton entertained
Colonel Arguelles and Lieutenant Jtjge
Bernal and provided them with horses
to return to their camp.
In the course of the conference yes- j
tefday Jacob ii. Schurtnann, president
of the American Philippine Commis
sion; told Colonel Arguelles that if the
insurgents would lay down their arms
he and his colleagues of the com- i
mission would consult them regarding j
the plan of government to be sub
niitted fo President McKinley. He j
said he could not promise that all their j
puggestlons would be adopted, but he j
could assure them that there would be
p presumption in favor of their sug
â A- ctlons, adding that the Commission
ers would he especially desirous of sat
isfying the legitimate aspirations of
the Filipinos.
Arguelles begged that the indepen
dence of the Filipinos at once be
granted.
When Colonel Arguelles protested
that unconditional surrender would be j
humiliating, Mr. Schurmann replied:
"There would be no humiliation in
General Otis treating our brother
Filipinos as General Grant treated our
brother Americans at Appomattox."
Mr. Schurmann said to-day to the
correspondent of the Associated Press:
"I believe Colonel Arguelles is per
sonally sincere and honest, though I
have no meats of ascertaining the sen
timents and ins of the authorities be
hind him. The Filipino people, like
other Asiatic peoples, have no trust in
mere words without force behind them,
â¢ but with force I consider a conciliatory
spirit of the utmost importance.
"I believe, when peace has been es
tablished, governing the Filipinos will
not be a difficult, matter, provided we
show them firmness, justice and kind
liness. At the present time they dis
trust and dislike us, but these senti
ments, which are, perhaps,, not unnat
ural, will soon be dispelled by the ef
tf'-ets of the good government we have
-\.'*mised them to tstablish here. It
will be the foremost duty of American

CALLS IT A MONSTER
Pleased His Holiness Has Rooted
Out "This Cockle From the
Field of Wheat."
Social Dispatch to The Call.
XEW YORK, April 30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Arch
bishop Corrigan's letter to the Pop*, on.
so-called "Americanism" in the Roman
Catholic church has reached Washing
ton, and its translation into English
has caused a sensation in Catholic
circles.
Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishops Ire
land and Keane and even conservative
Archbishop Ketzer of Milwaukee and
Archbishop- Horstmann of Cleveland,
solemnly protested to the Pope that
the errors which ho had designated as
"Americanism" had no place in the
American Roman Catholic church.
The Archbishop of New York admits
the charges against the American Ro
man Catholic, but stands alone am >ng
the American hierarchy.
In the course of his letter. Archbish
op Corrigan calls "Americanism" "a
monster which, in order to acquire the
rights of citizenship among us, has as
sumed that fair name," and' he adds
later. "Your Holiness roots out on its
very appearance this cockle from the
field of wheat." The letter is as fol
lows:
Most Holy Father: We cannot express
in words the feelings of admiration, of
joy and gratitude with which our heart
has been penetrated toward your Holi
ness in reading the masterly and admir
able letter which you have deigned to
adiiress to us on what for some time past
has been designated under the name of
"Americanism."
It is with greatest wisdom that your
Holiness has united into one group many
and fallacious errors which would like
to pass for good Catholic teaching under
the specious title of "Americanism." but
at the same time with what great pru
dence, discretion and kindness as well as
with what force and clearness has ypur
Holiness fulfilled the mission of a sup: .
and infallible teacher.';
-In truth the last document of your
Holiness in wisdom is in no way inferor
to so many others which in the course of
your glorious pontificate have excited the
universal admiration of peoples.
For us. whom the Holy Ghost has
placed as Bishops to rule the church of
God tinder the infallible guidance of your
Holiness, we hasten to offer ami to make
known to you our sentiments of admir
ing and unqualified adhesion.
We receive and accept for ourselves,
our clergy and. for the communities and
congregations which with us work for
the salvation of souls, as well as for ail
"Testem benevolentae." We accept it
and make it our own, word for word,
sentence for sentence, in the same iden
tical sense in which your Holiness, fol
lowing the tradition and wisdom of all
Christian antiquity. intends it, and
wishes that it # should be understood by
us. *
In its regard we shall never make, nor
shall we ever permit that others depend
ing from us, either directly or indirectly,
should make any reservation or tergiv
ersation. Your Holiness has spoken. The
question is therefore ended. This thought
has given us great satisfaction.
We can say also that the monster,
which in order to obtain a lasting abode,
to acquire rights of citizenship among
us, assumed to itself the fair name of
"Americanism," has on its first appear
ance been struck down dead. But it is to
you that the glory of this happy result is
due.
If your Holiness had not opportunely
come to our aid with your admirable let
ter, how numerous might have been those
who through ignorance, rather than
malice, would have been brought into
the trap. Bishops and clergy would
have had hard work to keep their people
out of error. It would have taken root
little by little, always increasing, and
soon we should have been pointed at with
the accusation of not being Americans.
Meanwhile, this false "Americanism,"
understood like other similar titles,
which to the great delight of souls lasted
I f&r res among other nations, would have
tranquilly taken possession ln our midst.
; piling high up its conquests in enormous
proportions of time and place. it is there
fore that we rejoice greatly, that by rea
son of your infallible teaching we have
not to transmit to our successors the un
grateful task of fighting an enemy which
would not have died.
And now, with our heads high, we can
repeat that we are Americans as truly
as any one, whoever he may be. Yes, we,
are, and we glory in it. \\ .â  glory In it
because our nation Is great in its Insti
tutions and in its undertakings; great In
Its development and in its activity: but
in the matter of religion and the doctrine
of discipline, of moralty, of Christian
perfection, .we glory in following Implic
itly the Holy See.
For these reasons we are and shall ever
be most grateful to your Holiness, who,
by your imperishable letter, "Testem
benevolentae," has said to us and to all
Catholics of America, "Signal blessing."
Yes, by testimony of kindness your Holi
ness roots out on its very appearance the
cockle from the field of -wheat.
May the all-powerful Lord preserve the
health of your Holiness, for many more
years, so that your Holiness may. with
your own eyes, see ripen to perfectness
the fruit of your, apostolic vigilance. .
Prostrate at the feet of your Holiness,
and kissing them with profound respect,
we implore for us, for our clergy and for
our flock apostolic benediction.
For Bishops of â¢ ecclesiastical province,
your province. ,*..- s * . .

Orders were received at fort
Snelling to-day to hold in
readiness troops there for de
parture at any mordent for
Wardner, Idaho, the scene of
Saturday's trouble amoi)g
the rrjiners.
ST. LOUIS, April 30.â Captain
Woodbury of the Sixteenth United
States Infantry, at Jefferson Barracks
received orders 'to-day to hold the
troops in his command in readiness
to move at a moment's notice It is
believed they will be sent to Ward
ner, Idaho, to help quell the miners'
riots. :fiff--'
SPOKANE, Wash., April 30.â A1l is
quiet in the Coeur d'Alenes to
night, although the decent people
of Wardner, Wallace, Burke, Gem
and other towns in the district
have no feeling of security, and many
of them are coming into Spokane.
Most of the rioting miners who went
from Wallace to participate in the de
struction of the Bunker Hill and Sulli
van property have returned to their
jobs in the union mines. â  - >
Between fifty and sixty of the non
union men who escaped from the Bun
ker Hill and Sullivan have returned to
that property after a night in the hills
j and are so far unmolested.
Through the Coeur d'Alene towns' a
reaction has set in and the destruction
of so much property, throwing 1000
, men out of employment and thereby
paralyzing all business in Wardner, is
now being condemned.
Coroner France of Shoshone County
j has created a sensation by declaring
that he will conduct a searching in
j quest into the death of Jack Smith, the
; rioting miner killed in the fusillade
! when two bands of rioters fired on each
other by mistake^
"No straw verdict," said he, "will be
accepted." This is recognized as some
thing of an innovation. fyf
"I shall summon every man in the ,
county if necessary in order to ascer
tain the cause of his death," said Coro
ner France decisively to-night. "No
straw .-verdict will 'be -.received. I shall
continue the hearing as long as may
be necessary."
Smith's body is 'now lying in 'the
Miners' Union Hall at Burke,. where it
was taken by the rioters on their re
turn there yesterday' afternoon.. At
first -some difficulty was looked for in
holding the inquest.. The 'miners sent
word down to Dr. France, the Coroner,
I that he would be expected to come up
there in order to examine into the'
cause of death. They added that in
case he did not see .fit to do so, one of
the local magistrates would be called
I upon to conduct, the examination. Dr.
France /promptly telephoned to. Paul
Cochrane, the secretary of the Burke
union, and held him responsible for the
safe keeping of the: remains until the
Coroner himself could conduct the
hearing. ' .ff ffy 'â¢:*..";. '"f'-i-'f;ff.-l* s "iff.
Last night Mr. Cochrane telephoned
back that the body would-be' held. there
subject to the , orders of , Dr. jj France.
Th- latter authorized a firm of Wal
! lace undertakers to bring ; the ' body
down from Burke, , and it will probably
be. brought back here -to-morrow..

if Governor Steuenenberg
of Idaho to assist in quelling the
riot at Wardner and preserving
order, In the absence of General
Shafter, who is at Bakersfleld.
Adjutant General .Babcock yes
terday received a dispatch from
General Miles at Washington,
notifying him that General ] H.
C. Me'rriam.^of the Department
of the Columbia, had been placed
in command of of all troops or
dered to the scene of trouble and
instructed to call for reinforce
ments without regard to depart
ment lines. General Babcock
was further ordered to Inform
every post commander in this
department to hold all troops
ready to respond to any call that
General Merriam might make at
a moment's notice. Orders were
at once sent to all the posts of
the department. At the Presidio
Colonel Compton issued orders
for troops B and . M of the
Fourth Cavalry and the com
panies of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry now there, to hold" them
selves in readiness. None of the
men, of these commands- were
permitted to leave the reserva
tion last night. All of the bag
gage that they might possibly
require was packed early in the
day, and they are prepared- to
march as soon as orders may
come.
It is not improbable that if
General Merrlam needs any
troops from this department the
cavalry and infantry at the Pre
sidio will be sent to him. j The
railroads have been informed'
that a special train may be need
ed at any time and to make ar
rangements to furnish transpor
tation. The fact that all of the
posts near, the scene of trouble
have such small garrisons, in
fact, no more, men than is ab
solutely needed to run them. it
is Likely that if troops are needed
those at the Presidio will; be or- :
dered to -Wardner, as troops can
be drawn from the Presidio more
conveniently than from any
other ' . post. " Colonel Compton
j said last night that he had is
sued the -necessary orders to the
troops under his command, and
that they -were prepared to move

they will never live in the Coeur

The appearance of the refugees is
pitiable. Without an exception they

OPPOSITION TO. THE
ORDINATION OF BRIGGS
Episcopal Clergymen May Take a
United fc>tand to Shut Out , the
Ex-Presbyterian Minister.
NEW YORK, April âWith each suc
ceeding day of uncertainty relative to the
action to be taken by Bishop Potter in
the matter of the proposed ordination of
Rev. Charles A. Briggs, there is a deepen
ing of the opposition among the Episcopal
clergy to the admission to the, priesthood
of the famous Presbyterian minister. The
movement is contemplated for concerted
action to protest against the ordination,
but it Seems not .to have taken a well
defined â¢ form. From opinions expressed
by - Episcopal clergymen th* failure to
take a decided stand ft based upon the be
lief or hope, that something will occur to
prevent success In the final stepâ that of
preferring charges of heresy against Dr.
Briggs. That, step is generally depre
cated except. as an extreme measure.
' A prominent clergyman said to-day that
he felt convinced the admission of Dr.
Briggs ' to priesthood .would be imme
diately' followed' by large' defections, to
the Catholic church. This opinion, he
said, was based upon conferences which
he had held with a large number of fel
low clergymen In this and other dioceses.

BRITON CRIES "LIAR"
Vast Assemblage of People to Pro
test Against the Policy of
Holding the Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 30.â Central Music
Hall was this after filled
with an audience gathered to pro
test against the course of the ad
ministration with reference to the
Philippines. Once or twice the proceed
ings were interrupted by protests of
those who differed from the sentiments
of the speakers.
Professor J. Lawrence Laughlin. of
the University of Chicago, in speaking
of the national policy toward the Fili
pinos, said:
"There the flag is the emblem of
tyranny and butchery."
Cries of "treason" came from the gal
lery, but the cries were quickly
drowned out by approving cheers.
When Bishop J. L. Spalding of Pe
oria declared that "England had never
been a friend of this country," an Eng
lishman near the platform cried.
"That's a lie." Without noticing the
interruption' the Bishop continued his
address.
Dr. Henry Wade Rogers, Professor
of the Northwestern University, acted
as chairman. Besides him, the speak
ers were Professor Laughlin, Bishop
Spalding, J. Lloyd Jones, Edwin Bur
rill Smith, Sigmund Zeister and Miss
Jane Adams.
The following resolutions were
adopted:
4- The frank expression of honest 4
. convictions upon great questions _.
7" of public policy is vital to the "*"
4- wealth and even to the preserva- 4
. tion of representative government. .

4- sacred duty of American citizens. 4

4- "criminal aggression." and open 4.
disloyalty to the distinctive prin
"â¦" ciples of our Government. "â¼"
4- We honor our soldiers and 4-
V sailors in the Philippine Islands
â¢â¼" for their unquestioned bravery, "*"
4- and we mourn with the whole na- 4
. tion for the American lives that - .
"*" have been sacrificed. Their duty "â¦"
4- was obedience to orders; our duty 4
. is diligent inquiry and fearless pro- '.
7. test. We hold, that our own Gov- "*"
4- ernment created the conditions 4
â . which have brought . about the _.
"*" sacrifice. * â¢ "*"
4- We earnestly condemn the policy 4
m. of the present national adminis- a

+ spirit of ,'76 that our Government is 4
x. striving to extinguish In those a
71 islands; we denounce the attempt ~
+ and demand its abandonment. 4
x. .We deplore, and resent the a.
slaughter of the Filipinos as a
"â¦" needless horror, a deep dishoror to -4
x. our nation. a
We protest against the exten
"â¦" sion of American empire by Span- 4
-- ish methods and demand the im- _*.
mediate cessation of the war

I - ana continued by us. We believe .4.
. that a foolish pride is the chief
-1 "â¼" obstacle to a speedy settlement of "â¦"
!4- all difficulties. As Mr. Gladstone -4
. said to England, "We are strong
"*" enough to cast aside all considera- "â¼â 
4- tion of false shame, walking in -4
J the plain and simple ways of right c
"*" and Justice." .*_ jy-IyY
4- Our Government should at. once 4.
. announce'to the Filipinos its* pur* .
"*" pose to grant them under proper "â¼"
4- guarantees of order the inde- -4
x. pendence for which they, have so .
~ long fought,- and should seek by "*"
+ diplomatic methods to secure this +
"x. independence by the common con- .
"*" sent of nations. It is to-day as true T
+ of the Filipinos as it was a year -4
x, ago of the Cubans, that they "are _.
and of right ought to be free and T
+ Independent." 4-
President Rogers in his address said
he had faith in the sincerity of Presi
dent McKinley. li" said the President
had declared that he desired to be gov
erned by the wishes of the people
dealing with the Philippines. This be
ing the case, he wished expressions of
opinion from both sides. He denied
that those who cavor expansion have
a monopoly of patriotism, and he de
nied - that the United i States has any
moral right to scoop in the Philippines.
Bishop Spalding of Peoria, 111., said
in part: â â 
We are, at present, in the midst of a
crisis, In which hick of thought and de
liberation may lead us far from the
Ideals ' which, 'as Americans, we have
most cherished, and expose us to evils
of which we scarcely dream. We stand
at the parting of the ways. It is not
yet too late to turn from the way which
leads through war and conquest to im
perialism", to standing armies, to alli
ances with, foreign powers, and, finally
to the disruption of the Union itself, I*
Is not too late, because it is still posSi
ble, 'probable even, that the American
people- will reconsider the whole question
of the complications in which our victo
ries over Spain have involved us, -and
calling to mind the fact that they did
not enter into this war with Spain tor
the purpose of becoming an empire, but
for the purpose of helping others to

visitors under its direction, and in the evening there will be a banquet. On
Friday the roun/l of festivities will close with a ball in the Pavilion. â¢
While it is true that the delegates will have plenty to occupy their atten
tion in the line of entertainment they will, between times, have much to do In
legislating for the nterest of the order during the sessions of the Grand Court.
Much of the legislation that is to be discussed was detailed in The Call of last
Thursday. In addition there will be something proposed to advance the inter
est of the junior branch. known as the junior courts, three of which are lo
cated in San Franciscoâ Court Pride of California, Young America and Pride
of the Golden West. These courts are probationary schools in which youths
are taught the principles of American Forestry, and when they attain majority

We have never looked upon ourselves as
predestined to subdue the earth, to com
pel other nations with sword and fire to
accept our rule.-; we have always believed
in human rights. In freedom and oppor
tunity, in education and religion and we
have Invited all men to me and enjoy
these blessings in this half a world
which God has given us, but we have
never dreamed that they were articles to
be exported and thrust down unwilling
throats at the point of th. bayonet. We
have sympathized with all oppressed peo
piesâ Ireland. Greece, Armenia and
Cuba. To emancipate the slave we
gladly sacrificed the lives of hundreds of
thousands of our soldiers. And now the
American soldier, who never shoulders a
gun except in a righteous cause, is sent
10.000 miles across the ocean to shoot men
whose real crime is that they wish to be
free, wish to govern themselves. To
say that they are unfit for freedom is to
put forth the plea of the tyrant in all
ages and everywhere. The enemies of
liberty have never lacked for pretexts to
Justify their wrong, but. In truth, at the
root of all wars of conquest there lies lust
for blood or for gold.
If the inhabitants of the Philippines
came gladly to throw themselves into our
arms we should refuse to do more than
counsel, guide and protect them, until
they form themselves into a stable and
Independent government. What, then, is
to be thought of those who seem resolved
either to rule or exterminate them, believ
ing, probably, that the only good Filipino
is a dead Filipino?
The argument that our policy has from
the beginning been one of expansion, has
no application In the present matter. In
purchasing Louisiana and New Mexico
and I'pper California, including Nevada
and Utah and most of Arizona and a
part of Colorado, it may be said that we
bought land and not human beings land
that was part of our inheritance. But,
now. following the lead of our great capi
talists and trust lords, we buy at one
stroke 10,000,000 human beings, who live in
another hemisphere, who differ from us In
every way. who dwell in a climate that
is fatal to the white man, who can be of
no advantage whatever to us. but who,
if we persist ia holding them, will involve
us in the most serious difficulties and
dangers.
A war of conquest is contrary
to our fundamental principles of gov
ernment; it is opposeu to all our tradi
tions. The thought of ruling over subject
peoples Is repugnant to our deepest and
noblest sentiment. We have room for
three or four hundred mi. ..ons of human
beings. If more are required, and we are
true to ourselves, British America will
come to us wn.iout there being need of
firing a gun. We have money enough
already and our wealth is rapio -- Increas
ing. What we have to learn is how to
live how to distribute our money, how
to take it from its mastery over us and
make It our servant. â¢
Our capital is fast becoming the most
inhuman, the most iniquitous tyrant the
world has ever known. Its tyranny is a
blight and a curse to those who exercise
It as well as to the multiutde who are its
victims. Commercial and manufacturing
competition is becoming a fierce struggle
for existence. Whereas the tendency of
true civilization and religion is to con
vert the struggle for life Into co-opera
tion for life, Into work of all for all, that
all may have those Inner goods which
make men wis., holy, beautiful and

If lt is our destiny to become an empire,
It is not our destiny to endure as a re
public Empire and imperialism are asso

with militarism nnd conquest. Was not
the Roman empire built upon the re
public?
But, we are told that imperialism has
proved a blessing to Great Britain. In
this matter there is no parity between
England and the United States. If to
day England could be blockaded for six
months, she would starve. She is
compelled, therefore, to have a navy
as strong almost as that of all the other
nations: and this has led her to make
conquest after conquest until her empire
encircles the earth. But these widely
scattered dominions, though possibly
necessary for her existence as a first-class
power, are for her a cause of weakness.
Let her colonies but become dissatisfied
and they will fall from her as easily as
the ripe" fruit falls from the bough. She
governs them wisely, because only in this
wav can she govern them at all. â¢
It is hardly possible for an American
to speak of England and not feel grateful
thoughts and kindly sentiments stir with
in his breast. To her largely we owe our
liberties: to her our language; to her
Shakespeare. Milton and Wadsworth: to
her Bacon and Ruskin and Newman. Nev
ertheless the more we hold aloof from
England the better shall it be for Amer
ica. She has not an ally In the world
and there is probably not a nation in the
world which would trust her as an ally.
She has never loved us from the days in
which she oppressed the colonies to
the dark days when, by aiding the Con
federacy, she sought to make, the dis
ruption of the Union permanent. She does
not love us now. We are the most dread
ed rival she has. because we threaten her
supremacy in what is nearest and dear
est to herâ her finances. She is -confront
ed by difficulties and dangers of various
kinds from which we ire free.
An alliance with her would involve us
In the difficulties and dangers by which
he is confronted and from which we are
free We need neither her advice nor
her assistance. The. praises which she
now bestows on us, were they sincere,
would be superfluous; but since they are
given with the design of drawing us Into
an imperialistic policy and troublesome
entanglements, they are insidious and In
sulting. Our wisest statesmen have al
ways been opposed to militarism as a
menace to our liberty. We want nothing
more than the nucleus of an army, noth
ing which shall serve as a means of con
quest at home or abroad; and, for my
own part, I think a powerful navy a dan
ger rather than a protection. We have
nothing to fear even from a coalition of
the powers of Europe, were such a thing
possible.
With ourselves, as in the rest of the
civilized world,- there is a drift toward
socialism. We must face the great prob
lems thus raised with faith In our political
principles and with confidence in the good
sense and honesty of the people. To seek
refuge in the intervention of a standing
army, under the command of a quasi-dlc-
itor. or emperor, is to enter the wav of
anarchy and ruin.
When the American people resolved not
to hold what they never intended to take
possession of, they will have little diffi
culty in finding a solution of this Philip
nine difficulty. Above all. let them not
be misled by vanity; let them not harken
to the siren voice of English flattery; let
them not stop to think what other na
tions shall say, but let them, as becomes
a great, a free and enlightened people.

ILL-LUCK PURSUES ONE,
FORTUNE THE OTHER
, Contrast in the Careers of Two Men
Operating in Shasta County
Mines.
REDDING, April 30.-The sale of the
Capital mine brings Into prominence the
striking contrast in the luck of two men
[ who have been operating in the mines of
, Shasta County. One has the record of
j selling two fortunes for a tithe of their
J value, and the other of buying two bank
accounts for a song.
Last night Sheriff Behrens accepted
â  first money on the Capital mine, the bal
ance to be paid on Saturday. To-day the
i Sheriff received news from his superin
l tendent that a rich two-foot ledge had
! been struck in the Capital, and his su
, perintendent advised him not to sell the
property short of $10,000. The sale had
: already been effected for $3000. The mine
i Is located a mile and a half from Kes
: Wick. *
Not long ago Sheriff Behrenrf 1 and a
partner Bold the Mount Shasta mine for
| $6000. It has since produced many times
that amount and to-day $100,000 could not
touch it. Ninety men are employed in the
mine and 'twelve six-horse teams are
; hauling high grade ore to the smelter. So
much for Sheriff Behrens' luck.
The buyer of the Capital mine, which
trebled in value in one night, is Colonel
J. H. Moore. A short time ago Moore
bought a third Interest in what was
afterward named the Daisy Belle mine,
located near Furnaceville. ' He paid $'">
for his interest and in a few days a strike
was made which netted the owners $4500
within a week.
Eleven hundred acres of auriferous
gravel lands along the Trinity River in
the neighborhood of Bragdon have just
been bonded to an Eastern company for
$23,000.
Federation in Australia.
LONDON, April 29.â At a meeting of the

nouncement that recently he had been
able to inform the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, that
three Australian colonies are framing

Trial.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, April 30.â Harry Wil
son, the mulatto criminal who is
wanted in San Francisco for burglary,
and who Is suspected of having
strangled May McDermott and Bertha
Paradis, was captured this noon by
Chief of Police Rawle, and is behind the
bars in the County Jail. Credit for
this capture is due to Lee Rawle, son of
the Chief of Police. Young Rawle is
employed as watchman at Capitola,
four miles from this city. Last even
ing he was at Capitola Station as the
train passed through for Santa Cruz.
Rawle happened to glance toward, a car
window and got a glimpse of the face
of a colored man he thought resembled
the description of Wilson. He tele
phoned his father, the Chief of Police,
who notified other officers, and a look
out was kept the entire. night.
This morning shortly before 6 o'clock
young Rawle made the trip from Capi
tola on his bicycle, and started in
search of the criminal. He found his
man in the "O. X.," a 15-cent restau
rant, and told Wilson he was an offi
cer. Wilson seemed to be much per
turbed. He told the Chief his name
was Harrison, and that he was from
Watsonvllle, where he had been at
work for the past two years. He
could not give the names of any per
sons from -Watsonvllle, and the Chief
accompanied him up the street, where
they met a Watsonville man who failed
to recognize the mulatto.
As the City Prison was not considered
safe, Sheriff Besse was sent for, and
Wilson was placed in- a cell in the
County. Jail. He again said his name
was Harrison.
Chief Lees of San Francisco was tele
phoned to, and Rawle, after getting a
complete description, was positive he
had the right man. He returned to the
Jail, got Wilson into a private room
and told the fellow he knew his name
was Wilson, and there was 'no use
denying it. Wilson then gave in, say
ing:
"My name is Wilson and I am the
man you want."
He said if he had not been caught he
would have left to-night on the steamer
for Mexico. A telegram was sent to
chief Lees, telling Of Wilson's con
fession, and the following response was
received by wire:
"Detective Gibson left 4 o'clock train
with warrant for Wilson."
Gibson arrived this evening on the 8
o'clock train, and will leave to-morrow
morning with his prisoner.
Chief Lees received a dispatch yester
day! morning from Chief of Police
Rawle' of Santa Cruz that a colored
man answering the description of Harry
"Wilson, the suspected strangler. who
was released on straw bonds Thursday
night by Clerk Kelly of Judge Gra
ham's court, had been seen in his baili
wick.
The Chief at once telephoned to
Rawle to take the suspect into custody
and endeavor to get him to confess that
he was the right man. Detective Ed
Gibson was instructed by the Chief to
take the 4 o'clock train for Santa Cruz,
in the hope that the man was Wilson.
After Gibson had left the Chief was
gratified to receive a dispatch from
Rawle that the man had been arrested
and admitted that he was Wilson. He
will be brought back by Gibson this
morning. _________________________________ ,

Quartz Worth a Hundred Thousand
Dollars to the Ton Said to Have
Been Taken Out
TACOMA, April 30. â Ex- Governor
Bwlneford of Alaska left to-day for
Ketchikan, Southeastern Alaska, where
he will develop a twenty-five-foot ledge

paying quantities. The sinking of shafts
and the building of a wharf will occupy
his attention, the ledge' being at the
water's edge, on the line of travel to
Juneau.
Ketchikan is experiencing a mining
boom in consequence of the commence
ment of development of numerous quartz
properties in that district. Principal
among these is the Sea Level mine, which
has uncovered several ledges of free mill
ing, ore running from $18 up to thousands
of dollars per ton. The last quartz speci

to the Coast. Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash., April Sixty pros
pectors arrived here to-day from Copper
I River, Alaska, on the steamer Excelsior.
! They brought with them a repetition of
i the story of privation and death and
many bore evidence on their bodies of the
i ravages of scurvy and frost. A man
I named Young hobbled off the vessel on
! the stumps of two legs. Another, named
I Alex Powell, had but one foot.
F. C. Goodwin of Oakland, Cal., whose
legs are black with scurvy, and whose
knees are bruised by contact with the ice,
tells an interesting story of his experi
ences, which were similar to that of oth
ers. While camped in the interior his
partner, Wesley Scheidecker, of Grand
Ridge, 111., fell sick with the scurvy and
soon became unable to travel. Goodwin
strapped him on a sled and started to the
coast. After four days of almost her
culean labor he arrived at the mouth of
the Chitna River, but his partner was
- frozen stark and stiff to his sled. He
buried him in the snow.
Continuing his journey to the coast, he
came across a tent in which there were
two sick men with scurvy. They were
Dixon Hutton of Memphis and T. B, Raw
lins of Little Rock, Ark. Another man
happened along at the same time, and
he' and Goodwin put Rawlins and Hut
ton on a sled and dragged them to the
coast.
Just before the Excelsior left Valdes a
big slide was reported on the glacier,
but no particulars were learned. It was
rumored that a party of prospectors were
coming from the interior, and it was
feared they might have been caught in
the slide. H&Sil
The Government expedition under Cap
tain Abercromble was arranging to be
gin the construction of a road Into the
interior when the Excelsior left. Relief
parties with provisions and anti-scorbu
tics had been sent into the interior.
WHEELMEN COMPETE IN
LONG-DISTANCE EVENTS
Two Races at Santa Rosa Arouse
the Interest of the Sport-Lov
ing Public.
SANTA ROSA, April 30.â Two events I
which for weeks have been the talk of j
the local bicycle world were brought off
it- this county to-day. One was a road
race from Santa Rosa to Cloverdale, a I
distance of . thirty-four miles. The con- j
t..- ants . were Frank V. Reeves, a ma- I
chine operator on the Press-Democrat,
and James D. Gould, proprietor of the
Bonita restaurant.. The start was made
j at 5 a. m.. Reeves mounting his wheel a
few minutes after completing his work
for the night. Despite the fact that a i
wind was against them all the way the |
distance was covered in considerably less i
than two hours, Reeves winning by three
minutes and fifteen seconds. By the terms
of the agreement Gould forfeits his new
Cleveland wheel to the winner.
The other event was a road race be
tween George Felix, mounted upon a
White and Ben Noonan seated astride a
Clevelahd. This race had been arranged
between the proprietors of two local cy
cleries to settle a long-standing feud. The
course lay between Geyservllle and this
city, and a large and enthusiastic, crowd
had gathered at th.- -finishing point this
aftcynoon lv anticipation of witnessing
I the outcome.
At just .'* o'clock Noonan hove in sight,
coming down Mendocino street like a cy
clone. Felix came in seven minutes later.
The crowd gave the boys an enthusiastic
reception. Felix claims that Noonan
fouled him the other , side of Lytton
Springs by throwing a chain and padlock
into the driving gear of his wheel, break- ;
' ing his chain. This is denied by Noonan
'and his backers. The time made by the
winner was one hour and thirty seconds.
I The distance covered was just twenty
l flve miles. Al Edwardo, Fred Wiseman, :
John Goodman, Melville Shannan, J. C.
! Williamson and G. P. Barnum, the latter i
' two mounted on a tandem, acted as |
pacers. The affair and Its sensational I
outcome have occasioned a great display

abouts has instruments by which the
direction could haH; been ascertained.
The shock was the heaviest at Del Monte
and continued some seconds longer there
than elsewhere. No damage resulted. At
Pacific Grove two distinct shocks were
experienced, the second ; following the first
after an interval of two or three seconds
and being more severe. Rain has been
falling since noon to-day, a weather con
dition never before known to accompany
an earthquake. a
MODESTO. April 30.-Sharp shocks of
earthquake were felt here at 2:45 o'clock â¢
this afternoon. There . were two shocks.
Several showers fell to-day and the total
this evening was .10 of an inch. It is still
threatening.
DECOTO. April 30.â Two sharp shocks
of earthquake only two or three seconds
apart were felt in this section at 2:41
o'clock this afternoon. They caused many
clocks to stop and did slight damage in
some sections to badl" constructed or old
buildings. The vibrations seemed to be
from north to south and lasted several
seconds.
STOCKTON. April 30â An earthquake
was felt at 2:41 o'clock this afternoon.
Two minutes later it was followed by a ;
second temblor. The- vibrations were |
light and lasted only a few seconds.
SANTA CRUZ, April 30.â The heaviest
earthquake in years jarred this city at \
2:30 o'clock this afternoon. Houses were
shaken, bric-a-brac was broken and in
some stores clocks were thrown from the
shelves to the floor.
SAN RAFAEL. April Marin County
was shaken by a temblor a few minutes
before 3 o'clock this afternoon. The shock ]
was distinctly felt at San Quentin. The
vibration was from west to east. So far
no damage to property has been reported.
SAN JOSE, April 30â A slight shock of
earthquake was felt here this afternoon I
at 2:44 o'clock. It is reported from Lick
Observatory that the motions were varied
in their direction and the vibrations were
remarkable for their long continuance," be- j
ing nearly thirty seconds. .;..>-:_-.- 1
JUST A SLIGHT SHOCK.
"Not Worth Recording," Says Pro
fessor Burckhalter.
San Francisco was shaken by an earth- {
quake yesterday afternoon, the seismic
disturbance lasting about ten seconds and j
consisting of two distinct shocks with
Intermediate vibrations of the earth. The i
first shock was felt at about 2:45 p. m.,
and while people were wondering whether
it was really an earthquake the vibrations
nearly ceased, and then the temblor
seemed to take a fresh grip and with a
final shake that rattled the windows of j
buildings all over town, subsided. It was ;
a very ordinary "quake," and although :
felt In all parts of the city caused not
the slightest damage so far as known. In
fact, the disturbance was so slight that
many were not aware of the presence of
the subterranean visitor until after the
shaking process had been concluded and
normal conditions again prevailed.
The earthquake was felt on the other
side of the bay, but the scientists in
Oakland and Berkeley who recorded the
seismic vibrations apeak of it in a tone of
disgust as an Insignificant affair and
hardly worthy of their attention. Profes
sor Charles Burckhalter, astronomer in
charge of the Chabot Observatory, in Oak
land, was in th* act of removing a smoked
glass from the seismograph which regis
ters the pranks of the temblors when a
Call reporter arrived there.
"Why, it really didn't amount to much,"
said he. "l won't waste a plate on it.
It was only one of those chatters, an.l
the earth really did not gyrate. No
doubt it came a long distance. 1 wouldn't '
say.it was slight, but lightâ that's bet- i
ter. The ", exact time was 2 hours, 41
minutes, 29 seconds.' its duration was ten
seconds, and the vibrations were from !
southeast to northwest." BaPtiMEfs
The clock of the seismograph at the
Students' Observatory in Berkeley
showed the earthquake to have passed
hy the university town at 2 hours, 41
minutes and 30 seconds past noon. All
the instruments gave excellent records,
but the shock was so slight that Dr.
â  Arhln O. Leuschner, the â¢" director-in
â¢ ' charge was inclined to rate it as of very
' little Importance unless reports should
show the disturbance to have been gen
eral The principal motion was toward
the west with a slight motion also to the
north By the Rossl-Forel scale its in
tensity would be measured by the Roman :
numeral it. The first shock lasted two
seconds, being succeeded by a number of
dvlng-out vibrations continuing for twelve
seconds. The latter were so slight that i
only the instruments could have detected
them. . __.___,__, .__
The principal shock consisted during the
first half second of three distinct vibra
tions causin" a total displacement of the
ground of one-twenty-fifth of an inch.
The corresponding northerly displace
ment amounted to but One-fiftieth of an
inch These figures were identical with
all the observatory Instruments.

23, they celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage at their home,
seven miles south of San Jose.
Mr. and Mrs. Rogers are among the pioneers, having arrived in San Jose
on Christmas, 1852, For over forty-six years they have lived in the same house
on the Santa Teresa Rancho. __E_B
Both received their friends and callers in a manner that showed they still
have hopes of many years of life and the same degree of happiness with which
they have been blessed. All of their children, with their husbands and wives,
and" the grandchildren were present.
Eleven children were born to the couple. Five girls and one boy are living.
Two children died oefore reaching California and three since. Those living are:
Mrs. Emily J. Colombet, Mrs. Amanda C. Brandon, Mrs. Lily Singleton, Miss Ida
Rogers. Mrs. Delia Lester and George L. Rogers. The grandchildren are: Mrs.
Clementina Struven of San Francisco, Miss Charlotte Colombet, Master Charles

pects ara most flattering. All the rivers
and creeks, from which most of the
water for inundating land is obtained, are
full, while from some mountain streams
damage is expected. Captain O. Cayer,
who has charge of the Spreckels Sugar
Company's Spence' ranch near Salinas,
received* a telephone message from King
City stating that the rainfall at- Jolon for
the storm was over four inches and that
the San Antonio and Nacimiento were ris
ing rapidly. Word was also received that
the Arroyo Beco was booming. The tem
porary dams in Salinas River at Spreck
els for irrigation purposes were taken out
before the rise reached that point. The
weather is still threatening, the wind
from the south and th*' barometer low.
AUBURN, April 30.â 1t commenced rain
ing this morning and continued all day.
While the cherries will be damaged
somewhat and strawberries retarded,
much benefit will be done to grain in the
lower end of the county. The wheat yield
promises to be the largest since ISSO.
STOCKTON, April Rain began fall
ing early this morning and continued in
termittently until 5:30 p. m. The rainfall
for the storm is .43 of an. inch; for the
month. .53, and for the season, 15.73,
against 6.03 last season. .-
DECOTO. April 30.â Light rain com
menced falling at noon to-day and con
tinued at intervals throughout the after
noon. The precipitation was .22 of an
inch. It is a great help to the newly
planted crop of sugar beets and did no
damage to fruit on the trees.
SANTA CRUZ, April 30.â Rain com
menced falling at noon to-day and con
tinued steadily the entire afternoon.
SACRAMENTO. April 30.â There were
several brisk showers here to-day. The
fall did not measure much, but it was
enough to moisten the surface of the
ground and freshen the growing grain.
The cool, soft weather is beneficial. Vege
tation of all kinds is thriving.
SAN JOSE. April There was the
heaviest rainfall of the present wet sea
son here this afternoon. Tn a few hours
.20 of nn inch fell, and then It cleared and
is cold to-night. The rainfall for the

excursionists bound for different points
along the shores of Lake Ontario in th-
Irondequoit Bay district, left tin- Bay
Station iii this- cit.v at 2:41 o'clock this
afternoon, about fifteen minutes late.
Every seat in the coaches was filled
and a large number of people * ere
islanding on the forms. The train
was made up of an engine, me closed
and two open coaches. There is a
grade about 100 yards from the corner
of North avenue and Ridge road, and
when this grade was reached the speed
of the I rain increased perceptibly.
Down the grade went th*- train, its
speed increasing constantly. When
the far curve was reached the engine
rounded it with startling rapidity.
Next to the engine was the closed car
riage, divided into two compartments, j
and when it ached the curve it veered j
over to the north side of the road
around the curve on the left wheels.
It had gone but a part of the bend in
the track when it left the rails and
shot straight ahead. There was a sud
den crash and the couplings between
the engine and coach *vere severed and
the coach again veered over and ;
plowed through the earth for several
feet before dropping on its side in the ;
front of th*- Ridge Road Hotel.
The closed coach which was over- i
turned had a partition that divided :
the front part from the rear. Men and
women were thrown into a jumbled
mass over against the roof of the car i
nnd were pinioned under the seats and
the partitions in th- car, which was
torn to splinters.
John Hilborg was standing on the
platform and was caught between the
two cars and crushed to death.
The work of rescue was energetically I
carried on, and as sunn as each sufferer
was taken out he was sent to the hos
pital.

ONE OUTLAW KILLED
While Attempting to Capture His
Companion Alive the Officer
Is Shot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OGDEN, Utah, April Captain of
| Po.ice William A. Brown was killed
I this afternoon by a crook whom
ihe sought to arrest. Last night citi-
I zens of Brigham City were held up
|by two men, and at about 10 o'clock
the cutthroats were found near the Hot
Springs, ten miles north of Ogden. The
Sheriff of Box Elder County and his
| deputies had a running fight with them,
! during which time about forty shots were
! fired without a single one taking effect.
[ During the light the robbers threw away
their plunder. They escaped to the moun
tains.
The Sheriff telephoned to ngden for
help. Sheriff Layne, Deputies Belknap
and Bailey and Captain Brown of the po
lice force went out at 4 o'clock this morn
ing, and at 3 o'clock this afternoon they
had the two robbers entrapped in the
mountains. At the time the Sheiff's posse
was about l"" feel above the men and
looking clown on their hiding place. The
officers -all. d upon them to surrender and
the answer was a half-dozen bullets.
Three members of the posseâ Sheriff Cor
don of Box Elder, Deputy Belknap of
Ogden and Captain Brownâ then secured
a position behind some rocks and called
again for the outaws to surrender. The
elder of the two cried out, "We'll kill you
first." md fired again.
The three officers then took deliberate
aim and killed one of the outlaws. The
remaining outlaw started to run. Brown
cried out that he would capture him alive
and started toward him. Both were run
ning and Brown was gaining on the rob
ber, when he turned and fired, the bullet
passing through Brown's body from right
to left and penetrating the heart.
As soon as Brown fell the robber threw
up both hands and surrendered.
Captain Brown was a member of the
police force for ten years, and has been
a captain but three weeks. He had a
record for a larger number of arrests
than any other member of the force. For
years li,- was on the Union Depot heat.
and he was known to almost every
traveler who ever came through the city.
He was a brother-in-law of ex-Senator
Frank J. Cannon.
The dead robber was named 'William
Morgan and hailed from Chicago. The
younger of the two Is but IS years old.
His story is that the two were brothers.
The dead" robber was about 35 years old.
There is a rumor here to the effect that
a large party is en route to Brigham City
with a lynching In view.
FORESTS MENACED I
BY AN INSECT PEST
Government Agent Investigating in
Northern California and South
ern Oregon. |
SISSON. April 30.â A. D. Hopkins, pro- :
fessor of entomology, of Washington. D.
C, has been detailed by the Government
to investigate the destruction of timber
at Grants Pass. Or., by the insect or
borer that is becoming very destructive
in that locality. In speaking of his mis
sion Professor Hopkins said that through I
West Virginia and other Middle and j
Southern States over an area of 75.000 i
square miles the forests have been wholly j
destroyed by a borer or pest which he
thinks is the same as is reported from
this locality, and the Government is tak
ing active measures to ascertain the hab
its, character and extent of propagation
of the insect and to endeavor to destroy
It. In Squaw Valley he procured some
very fine specimens of a grub or borer |
and its workings. He expressed the belief i
that the healthy timber in this locality
was still free from the pest, owing to;
there being so much timber felled and
manufactured into wood and lumber in
this section that the 'nsect has other ma
terial in the way of stumps and old logs,
which it prefers to work on. There is
no immediate danger of the insect attack
ing the virgin forests and healthy tim
ber.

In California the
clay will be one of
special interest. It
was born here and
only here Is It recog
nized as a true na
tional holiday, for
only in this State
has the Government
sanctioned the firing
of the admiral's sa
lute of seventeen
guns, which will
form the warlike
element of the cele
bration. The re
mainder will be left
to the orator, the
singer, the band and
the crowds, and the
countless flags which
will wave the freer
from the victory won
for them in the
southern seas. The
day was the sugges
tion of the Sons of
Vermont. There was
a meeting of the or
der in this city last
January and the
proposition of as
sisting the Sons of
Veterans in celebrat
ing Bunker Hill day
In June was dis
cussed. It had al
most been decided to
join in that event
when It was sug
gested that the first
of May be made a
day of their own,
just such a day as
they had been look
ing for to give an
excuse for a celebra
tionâand what more
glorious cause than
the brilliant achieve
ment of Admiral
Dewey. The Idea
took at once and be
fore a week had
passed the president
of the order, Judge
E. A. Belcher, had
communicated with
all the branches in
the State and had
written to most of
those throughout the
country, and from
every side came the most favorable in
dorsements of the plan. And In recogni
tion of the origin of the idea of Dewey
day, when the Government was appealed
to to give military sanction to the cele
bration, a salute was ordered fired in this
Stateâ a favor granted to no other appli
cant.
The principal celebration will be- at
Sunset Park, in Santa Cruz County. The
Sons of Vermont will take charge of the
day there, and there will be speeches and
music and flags and enthusiasm to last
the day and perhaps a good part of the
night. * Judge Belcher will open proceed
ings with a few words of welcome, and
then will follow a programme of patriot
ism appropriate and inspiring.
It is announced that the celebration in
the Santa Cruz Mountains will take place
rain or shine. There Is a big pavilion at
the park, anyway, and there is no need
of any one getting wet, even should it
rain Its hardest.
The start will be made from the foot of
Market street. Those who go will have
to take the 8:45 narrow-gauge boat.
Round-trip tickets will be $1 and half that
for children under 12 years of age. They
can be purchased at tne ferry after half
past 7 this morning. The return will be
at such time as to land the people in the
city early in the evening.
Around the city the day will be ob
served in a variety of ways, but mostly in
the increase in the number of attractions
which invite people to stay out in the
air. The park will be the scene of the
prettiest ceremony of the day. With the
band playing martial airs the silken flag
made by the sailors of the McCul
loch and presented to the city when that
vessel arrived here after the battle of
Manila will be raised to its place of su
premacy over all.
There will be picnics without limit, for
this is the picnic season, and one of the
fruits of Dewey's victory was to insure
freedom to the people. There is a good
part of the population of this city to
whom freedom means a picnic.

Jupiter Pluvius Regulates the Ele
ments and an Enjoyable Day Is
Spent in Games and

When the *49ers started for Schuetzen
Park, near San Rafael, on their fifth an
nual excursion and picnic yesterday it
was raining. But Jupiter Pluvius evi
dently holds the worshipers at the shrine
of the Argonauts in nigh esteem, for the
pilgrims received one of old Sol's genial
smiles as they disembarked on the Marin
County shore and the rest of the day was
theirs to enjoy.
The excursionists crowded all the boats
plying between this city and Tiburon dur
ing the morning and a few delayed their
departure until the afternoon. In all there
were fully two thousand people at the
park, where Fred Schumann had made
all necessary arrangements for their re
ception. The day was pleasantly whiled
been invited to be present and to take
part.

scholars and if expectations are realized
there will be fully three thousand chil

The salute of seventeen guns will be
fired from the training ship Pensacola,
from Aleatraz and from the Presidio.
That from the Pensacola will be at 8

The celebration commenced as early as
last evening, when a number of the local
ministers took as their, texts for the Sun
day evening sermons something pertain
ing to the great victory and the man who
won it.
Rev. F. C. Lee of the California Meth
odist Episcopal Church spoke on "Admir
able Admiral Dewey. ' In the course of
his remarks he said:
All hail Dewey! All hail Dewey Day! An
other star ls added to our galaxy of heroes.
Among the Sabbaths of our national life a
new day has dawned. I believe there are
some things worth fighting for, and liberty â
civil and religiousâ ls one of them. There Is
such a thing as righteous warfare, and for
the righteousness of our wars as a nation we
challenge the world for as clean a record.
Think as you may, I for my part do not
believe that all the good and great men are
dead and buried. I believe there is just as
good patriotism and just as much of lt ln
the world to-day as ln any previous day. I
believe there is Just as much honor. Just as
much courage. Just as much purity and vir
tue. Just as much brain and brawn In our
land and nation this hour as there was in
'76 or ln '63. Heroism and patriotism are not
extinct virtues, and let no man, with the
record of Santiago and Manila Bay before him.
dare to write opposite these obsolete!
With our pools and combines, trusts and cor
ners ln wheat, sugar, oil, coal, our feverish
anxiety for the latest mining and stock quo
tations, it may look to a Spaniard or a Fili
pino that we worship the "Golden Calf," and
while down on our knees in worship scram
bling for the mighty dollar. But when the
trumpet of war sounds the call to arms-
I away in dancing in the large pavilion,
! games of various kinds and feasting,
most of the picnickers carrying along well
I filled baskets, which were very light bur
dens on the homeward trip.
I The principal feature of the games was
a series of races in which young and old
alike took part and furnished the specta
tors with a deal of amusement. The re
sults were as follows:
Boys under 14 yearsâ First, Robert Merrltt;
second. Frank Curry.
Girls under 14 yearsâ May Smith; sec
ond, Mamie Ryan.
Young men's â First, Frank Keene; sec
ond, Artie Jelinsky.
Young ladles' raceâ First, Martha Nickers;
second, Jennie Lynn.
Married ladles' raceâ First, Mrs. Margaret
Tuhey; second, Mrs. J. Jacobsen.
Fat men's raceâ First, Henry Kluff; second,
Jacob Carthart.
Kit ladies' raceâ First, Mrs. Mollie Shortens;
second. Mrs. Margaret Ryan.
Members' raceâ First, I. Betan; second, O.
H. Beige.
Committee raceâ First, Thomas Benson; sec
ond, J. T. Nelson. * â¢
The '49ers are composed of members of
San Francisco Parlor No. 49, N. S. G. W.
The committees having the picnic in
charge were:

and that God always
has the man for tic

our Shatter, our Schley

Let us then to-mor

senseless and heartless
custom of waiting un
til our heroes are six

fore we sing their
praise or wreath the
laurel. A kind word
while living is worth a
ton of granite when
dead.
Let Dewey day be
celebrated with burst

nation shout out its
praises so long and
loud that our words of
gratitude and good
cheer will go echoing
across the Pacific from
the Golden Gate to

dening the heart of
our Admiral â whose
name will go down In
history linked to that
of Nelson, Perry and

Admiral Dewey, as
an American citizen I
salute you. May you
"never give up the
ship" for the White
House; the bridge for

Dr. Charles Ed
ward Locke's sub
ject at the Central
Episcopal Church
last evening was
"D ewe y's Victory
and the New Prob-
lems and Opportuni
ties It Brings to
Church and State."
His text was "God
shall Mess us; and
all the ends of the
earth shall fear
h i m." Psalms
Lxvii:7.
__. Dr. Locke said:
This evening closes the most memorable year
of this generation. Between May 1. 1898, "and
to-night events have occurred which are chang
ing the policies of the nations and swinging
portals wide open to the progress of truth.
National expansion is Inevitable; It is thrust
upon us. The Philippines are ours as part of
the victory of war. The hands do not move
backward upon the dial. It would have been
cowardly to leave the Islands in the palsied grip
of Spain, and It would be cruel to leave them
to semi-savage self-government: and it would
be puerile to refuse to bear the obligations
which their retention will Impose upon us as
a people.
To take these islands and Christianize and
civilize them Is our response to to refrain of
the ages, "Westward, ho! the star of empire
takes Its way!"
Dewey's victory, which Is to be celebrated to
morrow, has also brought new and Imposing
opportunities to the church. The church la to
carry the pure gospel and teachings of Christ
to multitudes of people to whom the Son of
God has been misrepresented. The corruption
of the Philippine Islands Is Indescribable.
Loathsome orgies of Impurity have cursed the
people. Official rapacity and priestly despotism
have enslaved the inhabitants. I have details
of the depravity of the teachers and leaders
of the people that would be Indelicate to men
tion before this audience.
It ls the church's duty to go promptly into
these our new possessions, because here for
several hundred years has been exemplified the
fact that a Christian civilization without our
Christ does not civilize. And If avaricious and
greedy men are not preceded and followed by
Christian workers lt would be better for the
Filipinos to relapse Into paganism.
Abject heathenism ls better than modern
civilization without Christ. A Market-street
firm In this city makes a boast that the largest
consignment of beer ever made has just gone
to the Philippines. The excrescences of our
civilization are a curse to any people.
The cross must go with commerce. The ma
chinery of our methods of living and doing
destroys life unless there ls the great balance
-wheel of faith In ami love for Christ.
The last of the celebration will be
flashed from the slopes of Twin Peaks,
where the improvement clubs of the mis
sion will keep bonfires blazing until after
midnight.

A CLEAR COMMERCIAL SKY.
THE domestic and foreign trade of the United
States, as shown by the weekly exports, is ex
ceptionally prosperous. This is the season
when the export trade generally falls to its minimum
for the year, and in spite of this the exports of manu
factured products for the month of March were $36,
--000,000, or 35 per cent of all the exports, this fine
showing largely compensating for the falling off in
the shipments of cereals and other natural products.
This proportion has seldom if ever been touched be
fore, and it is a striking illustration of the great ex
pansion of our foreign trade. The exports of wheat
this crop year have been considerably less than during
the same period in 1898, the figures being 96.290,000
bushels, against 195.592,000 bushels. The bank clear
ings show no falling off in general business, those for
last week being 65.7 per cent larger than for the same
week in 1898, and New Orleans nd Minneapolis
were the only cities of any size to show a decrease.
The gain in New York was 91.7 per cent, in Boston
69.3 per cent, in Pittsburg 76 per cent, and 51 * on.
The commercial failures were 184. against 245 for the
corresponding week last year. There arc no signs
of a falling off in domestic trade anywhere, though the
demand for general merchandise is lighter, as is usual
at this season of the year, when the spring trade is
over and the summer trade has hardly begun. The
retail business of the country, however, is reported
good, being assisted by favorable weather.
The staples remain about as previously reported.
Wool is quieter but steady, and sales of foreign de
scriptions for export are still being made. Cop
per has ruled very firm at an advance. Leather is
also strong, largely owing to the small stocks of hides
available. Wheat is unsettled, but prices stand about
where they have been for some little time. Lumber
continues firm. Iron and steel are quieter as far as
new business is concerned, but prices continue strong
and the margin of profit is still good.
hi? remarkable hew well business stands the strain
of foreign complications. It was feared a week or
two ago that the strained relations in Samoa and the
Philippines would have an adverse effect, but thus far
none has been apparent. It was the same through
out the Spanish war. No matter what happened
abroad the business of the country went on expand
ing, with hardly a ripple on the commercial stream.
It is an object lesson to other countries, as showing
the stability of American institutions and the perfect
confidence of the American people in their Govern
ment. We know that we are able to take care of
ourselves on land or sea, and in the midst of war go
on merchandising as if war were a mere side issue â
something to amuse the children, as it were.
There was not much excitement in Wall street dur
ing the week. The continued easing of the money
market, larger supplies if funds and the disposition
on the part of the banks and money lenders to look
more favorably upon industrials as collateral had a
pood effect and the feeling was decidedly better. The
only drawbacks were the uncertainty regarding the
crops and a slackening of public interest in the
market, which made itself apparent in a falling off in
the volume of transactions. Bonds again came to the
front in preference to stock?, and were strong and in
demand.
Conditions in California continue brilliant. It is
resting to observe that in official reports of the
condition of the wheat crop the six principal winter
rv heat States make an average of 60 per cent, while
California is classed as perfect, or 100 per cent. This
means millions to us. and its importance cannot be
c\ stimated. If wheat is perfect the minor cereals
are likely to be equally promising, and they are. Fruit
conditions remain about the' same. With the single
exception of peaches the crop will be light, but there
will be no famine in any description, and the light
res': of the yield will result in higher prices and better
markets, besides leaving the field clear for the next
year. This season promises brilliantly for the fruit
grower and general farmer, and as a natural conse
quence for the merchant; and it is reasonably safe to
lay that 1899 will be one of the best all-round years
)he State has ever seen.
Massachusetts has* come to the conclusion that the
telephone business is a public service that ought to
be regulated by the public and not by a monopoly,
and a bill has been introduced into the Legislature
giving the State Gas and Electric Commission the
right to supervise it and fix prices. The conse
quence is the telephone company in Boston is crying
out that the good old State is getting to be as woolly
as Kansas.
.
The announcement is made that among the sup
plies the Government is to purchase for the Indians
this year re to be a number of lawn mowers, so the
next outbreak of the brave . will probably be one of
profanity because the Government did not provide
loldicrs to run the machines.
THE BATTLE OF MANILA BAY.
j r\ YEAR ago to-day, at a quarter to 8 o'clock in
i j\ the morning, while Admiral (then Commodore)
â  * Dewey and his forces were fortifying themselves
by a hearty breakfast for the second part of the battle
of Manila Bay, Colonel George A. Loud on the
revenue cutter Hugh McCulloch wrote in his diary
j the following words:
"This is Sunday and May day, and it will be an
j American date in history."
This prediction, made when the echoes of the ter
rible cannonade that had destroyed the flagship of the
Spanish admiral and wrought havoc on the Spanish
fleet and the Cavite battery had scarcely died away,
has been literally fulfilled. In the dead of the night
the American squadron had passed Corregidor
Island, and in the gray dawn it -had approached
within four miles of Manila. Five times it had
sailed in grand procession, describing a semi-circle,
and had poured jits terrific broadsides upon the
enemy, both in the water and upon the land. The
I. la de Cuba, to which the Spanish admiral had trans
ferred his flag, had been sunk. One torpedo-boat had
disappeared and another had been riddled under the
fire of the Olympia. When Colonel Loud wrote the
battle had been practically won, but at 20 minutes to
11 it was renewed, and by half-past 12 the Spanish
vessels were sunk or destroyed, Cavite had sur
rendered and Manila was at our mercy. Not an
American life had been lost and only five or six of a
gun crew on the Baltimore had been slightly
wounded by splinters.
I This is a brief record of a naval engagement that j
. humbled the pride of Spain, emblazoned our Occi- j
' dental flag with the splendors of the Orient, estab-
l ished a new epoch in naval warfare and enrolled Ad- i
: miral Dewey in the fraternity of the immortals. The j
sacrifice of life among the defeated Spaniards was
: comparatively small. But seven of their ships were
: swept from their chosen refuge, and their shore de
fenses, armed with powerful guns, reduced with a
precision and with a celerity that had never previously
been equaled. In every sense the victory was com
-1 plete. In the first actual test upon a large scale of
: modern vessels and modern armaments, in which me
. chanical adjustments play such a conspicuous part, the
United States led the powers of the world. Admiral
Dewey, with his broad intellect, with his scientific
education and trained experience, with his perfect
nerve and with his calm and prompt judgment, was
the very type of a great naval commander of the nine
teenth century. He made no mistakes, then or since,
either of omission or commission. The deep enthu- I
siasm of his countrymen, the plaudits of the nations;
have not shaken his self-poise. He remains where |
his honors were won, the appreciative recipient of !
Congressional ami popular distinction, avoiding the 'â 
rock of politics, upon which so many high reputa
tions have been wrecked, and illustrating his patriot
ism by the uncomplaining endurance of privations
and by the resolute fulfillment of duty. And no one
of the intelligent and brave officers and men who dis
played their superiority of race and of discipline has
been overlooked by their commander or will be for
gotten by their rejoicing fellow-citizens. All are in
cluded in the glory of this auspicious anniversary.
"Tho dominant blood that daunts the foe.
That laughs at odds and leaps to the blow-
It is Dewey's glory to-day, as Nelson's
A hundred years ago."
THE HUNTINGTON DICTATORSHIP-
T T has been the custom of Mr. C. P. Huntington
IT has been annual visit to Mr. State to deliver one
during his annual visit to this State to deliver one
speech, in which his imperial decrees were suc
cinctly registered. This year the latest phase of rail
road policy has been developed in a succession of ad
dresses by Mr. Huntington, in which his autocratic
character is boldly and incisively revealed.
He appears to entertain a sublime confidence in
himself and an unflinching determination to govern
both State and national policy. His blunt expres
sions, however, in the first place, conflict with estab
lished facts, and, in the second place, excite the
deepest hostility. If. in a few sentences on his own
behalf and representing his railroad corporations, he
would announce his withdrawal from all pretense of
supremacy over the law and over social, industrial and
political action, and then live, up to the declaration,
harmony would be restored and the railroad and the
public could labor together for that kind of prosperity
that would lift the State out of the slough of corrup
tion to a level corresponding with its geographical po
sition and its natural advantages.
But Mr. Huntington seems to be obstinately bent
upon rigid adherence to despotic conservatism, and
when, with the stern paternalism of William of Ger
many, he occasionally expresses his personal wish to
advance the public interests, prolonged and bitter ex
perience contradicts his statements.
In his address of Thursday night at the Palace
Hotel banquet he formulated his belief, in which the
intelligence of the world shares, "in the future of San
Francisco," and declared that the true interests of
the State and of the railroad were identical. This
proposition has never been seriously disputed except
by Mr. Huntington himself, whose definition of
mutuality of interest, like Lord Glosmore's concep
tion of liberty, means unqualified submission to rail
road demands and to railroad aggressions. With
marked consistency with his past conduct, but with
equally conspicuous inconsistency of sentiment, he
advocated Asiatic expansion, which would insure an
endless supply of cheap and degraded . labor, but
recognized the great necessity of California to be the
introduction of thrifty colonists. He even addressed
honeyed words to the unfortunate Finns, whose ex
cellent capacity for colonization will be generally con
ceded. But what immigrating spider would be de
sirous of entering the railroad web? Does Mr. Hun
tington remember the Dutch colony that was induced
to settle a few miles from Merced, which comprised
an unusual combination of intelligent, educated and
honest families, possessed of means, who transferred
themselves and their possessions with their Lares and
Penates to California? Those people were drawn
from their native land by glowing representations and
by flattering proposals. They brought with them the
industry and the integrity of their race and expended
large sums of money, established substantial homes,
erected ornamental and attractive structures for so-
cial purposes and commenced horticultural operations
upon an extensive and diversified scale. The result
was that, within a few years, their capital was lost and
their enterprise abandoned. Most of them were re
duced to poverty and the survivors returned to Hol
land. To-day their settlement is an uninhabited ruin.
The soil, thinly spread over the bedrock, would bring
no fruit to perfection, and the dead orchards and the
crumbling buildings are a ghastly memorial to fraud
and to greed.
White colonization is a prime necessity to this
State, but it must be promoted under public auspices.
It will not flourish through railroad methods.
There are many other striking points in the last
manifesto of Mr. Huntington. He indorsed in words,
as an excellent rule of mercantile life, supplementing
the payment of "legal taxes" by allowing a reason
able margin of profit to purchasers of goods, but he
omitted a reference, which the community will sup

ply, to the fact that the railroad has always been the
principal tax-shirker on this coast and has rarely con
tributed to the liquidation of public indebtedness ex
cept under compulsion or through compromises that
produced the most unjust unequality.
California does need "more people" and our mer
chants "more customers," but our "logical develop
ment" can only be secured through efforts apart from
the railroad, unless Mr. Huntington reverses his
policy and renounces a dictatorship, to which Ameri
can communities will not submit.
THE DREYFUS CASE.
IT has been frequently announced in the press that
the decision of the Court of Cassation in the
Dreyfus case will be promulgated to-day. Wheth
er this statement is authoritative or not remains to
be seen. All civilized nations await the final decision
of the tribunal that represents the ultimate judg
ment of France with the deepest interest.- The real
question seems to be whether, under a government
nominally republican, the law can be gagged by
military influence.
An enormous mass of evidence has been taken and
most of it has been published. That the conviction
of Dreyfus by a court-martial was improper is the
very least that can be claimed under the additional
proof. The bordereau, containing treasonable in
formation for the benefit of Germany upon which
the prosecution was based, must certainly now be
discarded. Three out of five experts at the trial ex
pressed the opinion that it was in the handwriting
of Dreyfus, but one of these three, M. Charavay,
upon further consideration, has retracted his original
views, and the majority, therefore, now favor the ac
cused. If in other respects the trial had not been
grossly unfair, this fact alone ought to insure either
the release of Dreyfus or a new hearing.
Under the French method of reinvestigation it has
been insisted that there were other evidences of guilt,
not introduced before the court-martial or the in
troduction of which was studiously concealed at the
time, by which' the alleged crime was or. might have
been sustained. The widest latitude for the pre
sentation of this testimony has been allowed by the
Court of Cassation, which has considered an unlim
ited number of documents and many oral statements,
chiefly hearsay, matter of opinion and vague con
jecture.
The result is that the case against Dreyfus has
been materially weakened, and, in the opinion of
sound lawyers in France and elsewhere, his innocence
has been at least presumptively shown. His alleged
confession has not been proved. The secret dossier
upon which so much reliance was placed was almost
certainly an ingenious afterthought. The trial and
acquittal of Esterhazy, upon a charge of having
written the bordereau, was transparently a concocted
scheme to check the development of public opinion
in favor of Dreyfus. The confinement of Colonel
Picquart, who chivalrously assailed the proceedings
that had brought reproach upon France, is an obvi
ous persecution. The arbitrary punishment of Zola
was an attack upon free speech and upon the right
to express honest opinions, for which the only re
cent parallel to be found is the legislative onslaught
upon the California press at the instigation of the
railroad.
The law governing the Supreme Tribunal of
France lias been amended during the present year.
As it now stands the revision proceedings must re
sult in one of three judgments. It may be held that
the conviction was legal and just, but this can hardly
be anticipated. It is more likely that one of the re
maining alternatives will be adopted. The Court
may annul the sentence, declare Dreyfus innocent
and award him an indemnity, or it may determine that
a crime was perpetrated, with which he was not
legally connected, and direct a retrial before another
tribunal. The last form of decision would simply
recognize the evident fact that some one having ac
cess to the records of the Staff Department of the
French Army had committed a heinous offense, but
would not imply a judicial belief in the guilt of
Dreyfus.
It is earnestly to be hoped that the outcome of
the investigation may relieve France from the im
putations of injustice and cruelty that have impaired
her national standing, and measurably remedy an
apparent atrocity, against which more than three mil
lion Frenchmen have at last protested.
THE SIBERIAN RAILWAY.
RECENT statistics relating to the great Siberian
Railway show that the line will be something of
much more value than a mere military road.
As the line open for traffic is extended the amount
of its business increases so rapidly there is abundant
evidence to justify the conclusion that the railway is
needed to meet the demands of commerce and in
dustry and will repay the Russian Government even
if it were of no strategic value whatever.
Upon the western and central divisions of the great
road now in operation there were carried in 1896 less
than 175,000 passengers. In 1897 there were 413,000
and in 1898 fully 650,000. The present year, it is pre
dicted, will see the number increased to 1,000,000.
Equally marked has been the increase in freight. In
1896 it was scarcely 405,000,000 pounds; in 1898 it was
more than 1,475,000,000 pounds. These figures show
to what an extent Siberia is being colonized and its
resources developed.
This rapid increase of traffic is said to be surprising
to the Russians themselves. It is much greater than
the road was prepared for, and as a consequence
while the line is being pushed forward at the rate of
about two miles a day a sum equal to $9,000,000 has
been appropriated to lay heavier and better rails along
certain portions of the old track to fit it for the traffic
carried on upon it; and at the same time something
like $20,000,000 has been set apart for the construc
tion of branch lines as feeders.
It has been long foreseen that the opening of the
Siberian road will work a mighty change in the course
of the commerce between Europe and the Orient, but
it now appears it will work in Russia itself a much
greater change than was expected. It has broken up
the stagnation of ages and set large numbers of Rus
sian people to traveling in search of new homes. It
has proven that Siberia is really a rich country^ fitted
to become the home of a prosperous people. It will
bring the wheat lands of Siberia into close communi
cation with the parts of Russia where droughts are
common and will thus aid in diminishing the suffer
ing which follows the frequent famines. The rapidity
with which the traffic is increasing also has had the
effect of encouraging the Government in the work,
and the enterprise is now being prosecuted with more
vigor than ever.
Miss Viola Jeffres of Telegraph Hill, the author
of the Tom Bozzle letter, is wasting her time in a
cracker factory. Her gift of metaphor should have
no difficulty in finding a market. "My heart beats
for you," she wrote, "like a nanny-goat on a tin
roof." Match that if you can for a figure of speech.
Let every shop be closed to-day anu every starry
banner fly. There is but one Admiral Dewey in the
world â he is ours.
OAKLAND HAS
CRAWLED OUT
OF THE HOLE
Won Another Game
From Sacramento.
NEW GROUNDS DULY OPENED
HITS AND ERRORS THE FEA
TURES OF THE EVENT.
Rain Interfered Somewhat With the
Play and Prevented the Game
at Recreation Park in
the Afternoon.
In a drizzle that threatened every mo
ment to develop into a downpour, Oak
land opened its new ball grounds at Gold
en Gate yesterday morning by defeating
the Senators by a
___^ score oMI to 5. It
was a nasty day and
none of the San
Francisco contingent
ventured across the
ba y, but several
hundred loyal Athe
nians braved the in
clement weather and
rooted for their
bunch of cripples.
It may have been
the rooting, or it
may have been the
moisture, or possi

the ball as they have

sphereâ that is everybody who ever pre
tends to hit it, and after the third inning
the result was never in doubt.
Sacramento presented Its regular team
with Beckwith in the box. Now Beck
with is a good out
fielder, a fair sticker
and an exceedingly
fast man on the
paths, his particular
feature being his
ability to get away
from a base, but
Beckwith should take
the miscreant who
made him think he
could pitch and
argue with him to
the contrary, using a
bat to enforce his
argument. Beckwlth

stern-wheeler gets

they will begin to
win games, but at
present they are
firmly Intrenched in the last ditch, and
It does not seem likely that any other
team in the league could rout them out
of it even If the attempt was made.
Sixteen hits, including two home runs

one inning was
enough for Russell.
Sacramento piled up
two runs and three
hits, and Russell
gave way to Moskl

the string, Dun

The Senators were as full cf holes as

STRONG'S MASTERPIECE
GRACES BOHEMIA'S WALLS
Portrait of dames Â«M. .Hamilton as a .Highlander.
JOSEPH D. STRONG'S masterpiece, the picture which added the capstone
to his fame as a portrait painter, is to be shown among the art treasures
of the Bohemian Club. It was upon this picture Mr. Strong placed the last
touches of his brush, completing the work just before he was stricken
down. James M. Hamilton, a lifelong friend of the painter, posed for the
picture. The face, slightly idealized, bears all the characteristics of the gallant
Highlander.
There is an atmosphere of the braes about it. The figure shows all the poetry
and strong character of the Scotch race, while there is a glint in eye which
speaks of the subtle Scotch humor so ably exploited here recently by the Rev.
Dr. Watson. Mr. Hamilton was a favorite model for Mr. Strong. He often
said he could, when blindfolded, reproduce the kindly and familiar features of
his friend.
The picture is said by critics to be a companion in portraiture to Charles
Rollo Peters' wonderful landscape, "The Camp by the Cross." Both bear the
stamp of genius and both are the product of the great West, now commanding
such widespread attention in art, literature ana music.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
France is expending $5,000,000 reboilerlng
and rearming the older Ironclads and
coast defense vessels.
The Russian cruiser building at Elbing,
Germany, has been named Novlk and is
to be completed by September, 1900. The
vessel is only 3000 tons displacement, but
is to steam twenty-five knots, and will
cost $2,152,500, exclusive of armaments.
Three of this type are contemplated to be
used as scouts.
Two cruisers about to be built for the
French navy, intended for courier and
outlook duty, are to be very fast. They |
are 394 feet in length. 44.6 feet beam and
4000 tons displacement The engines, of j
15,000 horsepower, are to give a speed of,
twenty-three knots, and the armament
will consist of eight 3 1-3-inch quick
firers, twelve 6-pounders and four 3
pounders. Their average cost is estimated
at $1,719,000.
There is great complaint at the Keyham
Naval Engineering School over the in
sufficiency of food given to the students.
After the noonday meal they only receive
weak tea. bread and butter, and at 9
o'clock in the evening each student gets
one bun. The engineer officers at the col
lege lay the blame upon the sailor officers,
who have charge of the Institution, and
are in favor of having the school taken
away from the control of the line and
turned over to the engineers and civilians.
â  It has been suggested by the London
Daily Graphic that the ships of the Brit
ish navy should have battle honor flags,
in the same way as the regiments have.
At the break of the poop and on the bar-
bettes or on the ring wheel appear
in large letters the names of the victories
in which ships of the same name have
taken part, but no ship has a flag bearing
such a record. Such a plan would no
doubt meet with approval if adopted in
the United States navy, and it would not
be records of victories gained by name
sakes.
The. London Times expresses some un
easiness regarding the use of water tube
boilers on naval vessels. When in 1895
the Belleville boiler was first introduced
in the Terrible and Powerful the Times
was not enthusiastic in favor of this new
departure, and it now expresses the opin
ion that the boiler accident on the Ter
rible is a blow to the advocates of this
type of boiler and that an Inquiry by the
Admiralty is needed to settle the question
of preference for the old style shell boiler
and the water tube type.
The several Russian battle-ships in
j course of construction all differ somewhat
jin size and general design. The Tsare
i witch, building under contract in France,
i is the largest, being 12,900 tons; Retrisam,
: building at ''ramus', is 12,700 tons, and
Pobieda (Victory), on the stocks at St.
j Petersburg, is 11,362 tons, and is 1300 tons
smaller but of the same general design as
the islabya and Peresviet. The Tsare
! witch will cost over $6,000,000, including
armament. One of the terms of the con
tract with the Cramps firm is that the
draught of the ship, ready for sea and with
1016 tons of coal aboard, is not to exceed
twenty-six feet. The consumption of coal
is also guarded against being too exces
sive and is limited to 1.7 p Hinds per horse
â  power per hour at a speed of ten knots.

The transports Grant and Sherman are
irttll in quarantine. The Sherman was to !
have come over yesterdlay, but Dr.
Brooksj the United States Quarantine Of- ,
fleer, changed his mind and the vessels j
had to remain at Angel Island. Both
transports will he thoroughly fumigated j
by to-day and the Sherman will then dock |
at Folsom-street wharf. With the Grant.
however, it will be different. Her crew
will have to remain In quarantine for a j
fortnight and the vessel therefore cannot
come out of quarantine unless the Govern- j
meat supplies another crew to bring her j
over.
It was the Intention of the quarter- j
master to dock both vessels at Folsom |
street (the Government dock) and in or- |
der to make room the Beelunaw was mov- j
ed to Main-street wharf, where she will
complete her loading. Both the Grant and
Sherman are 41J feet long and on the
south side of Folsom-street wharf only is j
there that amount of space. the north
side of the wharf ends at the easterly side ]
of Kast street, while the southerly side i
continues right across Kast street, a dis
tance of over one hundred ieet. there
will be pU-nty of room on that side there- ,
lure for the Sherman to-day, and the
Grant; when she comes out oi quarantine,
will go to Pac-ilic-street wharf (.the j
Oceanic dock).
I'nited States Quarantine Officer Brooks
spent the entire day on the transports. |
When he boarded the Sherman in the ;
morning Brigadier General Otis made a I
plea t<> be allowed to land. He explained j
that urgent business required his pres
ence in Bos Angeles, so Dr. Brooks gave
him permission to come ashore and placed
the quarantine steamer Sternberg at his
disposal. The other cabin passengers on
the Sherman came ashore a l 7 p. m. on i
the quartermaster's steamer ' ' I '..well. !
They were landed at Clay-street wharf |
and as soon as their baggage was checked |
they dispersed.
The loading and discharging of the :
Steamer Australia was carried on -imul
taneously yesterday. The vessel waa j
nearly two days late getting here from
Honolulu <m account of having to wait for
troops; and in order to get her away on
schedule time the stevedores have to
work overtime. An enormous quantity of
machinery for the sugar plantations is '
being shipped by the Australia.
Captain Lewis Baker and Steward Her
bert Edgar Passingham of the British
chip Mary A. TroojÂ» are on trial in Kng- I
land for maltreating and driving to his :
death a Chinese boy named Ah Ching. All j
tho vessels of the "Troop" fleet are known
as "hard ships" and the Howard D. ;
Troop; now on the Columbia River, is i
having considerable trouble in securing a
crew. The Mary A. Troop arrived at
Puget Sound the* latter part of last year j
ar.d she was not an hour in port before
the crew deserted. When she was ready I
to -.u'l another crew was procured after;
considerable trouble and among them was
Ah Ching. who shipped as cabin boy.
The unfortunate Mongol was the butt of
the captain and steward from the time the
ship passed out through the Straits of j
San Juan de Fuca. He -was beaten un- :
til his body was a mass of running sores,
he was compelled to eat rope yarn and
potato peelings and to lap up dirty water
from the deck. The crowning indignity,
from Ah Ching's point of view, was the
<-utting off e>f his pigtail. He then disap
peared overboard and is supposed to have
committed suicide.
\Vhen the Mary A. Troop arrived at
Buenos Ayres the crew went ashore and
made a statement to the British Consul.
He at once caused the arrest of Captain
Baker and Steward Pa - ! ;-ham and sent
them to England for trial. With thorn
went several of the sailors who are wit
nesses In the case.
Captain "Walley was placed in command
of the Mary A. Troop after Captain Ba
ker's arrest and he started from Buenos
Ayres fnr Hamburg in her. Had luck
seemed tn follow the ship after the death
of Ah <7hing and on March 26 the Troop
put into St. Thomas in distress. The cap
tain was sick, the enronometer broken
and the provisions had nearly all given
out.
Tho America Maru. which arrived from
thr* Orient last Saturday, brought the
news of the hard luck of the American
ship Sach*m. The vessel sailed from New
V'*rk for Shanghai with a cargo of kero
sene. When about half the voyage had
been covered Captain Schulz died from
Bright's diseast' of the kidneys and was
buried at sea. The mate then took charge
of the Sachem. In rhe Formosa channel
she ran into a terrific thunder storm. A
flash of lightning struck the ship and
the mate was knocked insensible. For
throe hours he lay as though dead and It
was only by the unremitting exertions
of the crew that his life was saved.
The ferry steamer Berkeley was again
In trouble yesterday. Something went
wrong in the engine room on the Â» a. m.
trip and she was laid oft for two hours.
The Piedmont took up her rum ing until
the necessary repairs were made, after
which the Berkeley went back on the
route.
CRUISE MARRED BY RAIN.
Yesterday's Storm Kept Many Yachts
at Their Moorings.
A second time the fates decreed against
a comblnc-d cruise of the yacht clubs. On j
Piimlay, April 23, the California and Cor- j
inthian fleets were to have met at Pre
sidio Shoal buoy and sailed in company;
alonp the city front. Despite half a gale!
from the southwest, the California^ were
at the rendezvous, but the Corinthians ,
did nut leave buron Cove.
On Saturday night more than thirty j
yachts of the San Francisco, Corinthian,
California and Encinal fleets lay at an- ;
chor in front of the San Francisco club- !
house, and everything pointed to a sue- j
cessful cruise on the morrow. But shortly |
alter 10 o'clock yesterday morning a
heavy rain set In. and though Commodore
T. 1.. Hill's flagship got under weigh
about 11 o'clock, and was followed by aev
eial yachts, all were soon lost to view
ln the obscuring rain. After sailing over

LUXOR WINS
THE STAKE AT
UNION PARK
Young America Goes
Down in Final.
The crowd which gathered at Union
Coursing Park yesterday to witness the
running down of the Class stake was
large The hares, however, were not so
tough as they had been on Saturday, and
the dogs all showed up in good form.
Luxor was victorious in the final run with
Young America. The course was short
and the decision was disputed by some,
but most were of the opinion that It was
correct. Connemara had been put out in
the fifth round by Luxor, after having
successively defeated Mercy May. Wait a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 1, 1899.
cessful courses, and Luxor, having had
comparatively easy chases, was in much
better condition.
The first course of the afternoon, with
Lawrence and Theron in the slips, was of
particular interest, as botn the dogs have
been the winners of the last two stakes.
Theron sold a 5 to 2 favorite, but the
fraternity fell hard when Lawrence got
the flag. There were a number of short
ends during the afternoon, but no very
heavy odds were risked in any of them.
In the second round, Lawrence and
False Flatterer went to slips twice before
a decision was given. The last of the two
courses was Long and exciting. The match
between Victor Queen and Emm Pasha
was short.
Much dissatisfaction was expressed at
the decision in the course between Mercy
May and Interesting. The reason for
such dissension was the fact that Inter
etlng having become unsighted when
he left the slips had just recovered him
self when the kill was made and the de
cision given to Mercy May. The course
was so short that many of the spectators
believed the dogs had not even met and
expected no decision. However, one was
given and there was general disap
proval.
The reserve stake will be finished to-day.
The trains will leave on yesterday's
schedule time. The following are the re

AMONG THE CRICKETERS.
British Sailors Tied Pacifies in the
First Match of the Season.
The first local cricket match of the
season was played on Saturday. April 22,
on the baseball ground in Golden Gate
Park between an eleven captained by C.
P. Coles of the Pacific club and a team of
apprentices from the British ship Crown
of India, King George, Coptic and Strath
don. The sailors were captained by the
Rev. H. W. L. O'Rorke, chaplain of the
Seamen's Institute of this city, . who
scored 19 runs for his side. The only other
batsman who scored double figures for
the sailors was Mr. Legg of the Coptic.
The innings closed for Cl runs. For the
j Pacifies C. P. Coles alone scored double i
figures, making IS runs. Shaw bowled
very successfully for the sailors, taking
six wickets. The Pacific innings closed
for 61 runs, and thus the match resulted
in a tie. C. Simmonds, formerly of the
Citrus Colony, Placer County, did good
service for the Pacifies, bowling three
men and catching three others.
The first match between clubs belong
ing to the California Cricket Association
will be played on Wednesday, May 3, in
Lake County between Burns Valley and
Lakeport teams, on the ground of the
former. The delegates of the Burns Val
ley club to the association have recently
been appointed. They are H. P. H. Hag
gitt and T. W. Beakbane. The Lake
County men are anxious that a team of
San Francisco cricketers should visit
them this season. They promise them
three matches and boundless hospitality.
In the last year of the century the Lake
County players hope to visit this city.
Burnell & Co., who last year gave a
bat, a pair of pads and a pair of batting
gloves to the association to be awarded
to the players making the best averages
in batting and bowling, have promised
three similar prizes this season.
The first match between city clubs will
be played on Sunday. May 7. at the Web
ster-street ground, Alameda, between the
Alameda and Pacific Cricket clubs. The
programme for the season Is in the hands
of the printer and will soon be issued.
It contains eighteen matches between the
Alameda, California and Pacific clubs for
the Brown pennant, to be presented at
the close of the season tp the club making
the best percentage.

Ariel Rowing Club Did Net Hold its
Regatta at Long Bridge.
The proposed regatta of the Ariel Row

Bhen the quarantine officers ordered

Some rare judgment and dlscrernment
was practiced by the quarantine officers!

dispensation was given his freedom early
in the day. Twenty-one officers who
were <*n the Grant were, also dismissed
from quarantine; but not until late in tho
afternoon; There were a number of other

among the rank and file, but who had
saved sufficient money t<> buy a first

GUS STRAND CRAZY.
Arrested for Larceny, He Has an At-
tack of Delirium.
Gus Strand, a real estate agent, who
has several times been arrested for half
interest swindles, turned crazy in his cell
at the City Prison yesterday morning. He
imagined that the cell Boor was full of
trap doors and that people were trying
to kill him. it.- was sent to the insane
ward in I he Receiving Hospital.
Strand was arrested last Wednesday for
being concerned along with Kern Kenny
In a swindle whereby a Mrs. Meyer was
induced to part with"?7"> em the false rep
resentation that she was to get an In
terest in some business.
Some months ago while Strand was in
: the prison he attempted to hang himself
; in his cell; and made another attempt in
: the insane ward in the hospital. At that
I time he was suffering from the effects of
a prolonged debauch, and it is supposed
that he had been again drinking heavily
before being arrested.

of three beautiful and impressive cere-

In the morning Father Dastler, superior
of the redemptorists, celebrated solemn
high mass and Inaugurated a mission for
women. Earlier in the day 300 of th*- boys
and girls of the parish received their first
| communion. At 4 o'clock in the after-
noon Most Rev. Archbishop Riordan ad-
ministered confirmation to another class
of 300 of the boys and girls who were
gathered to receive it. In the evening
Father McGeogh preached an eloquent
sermon.
The administration of confirmtlon in
th*- afternoon was a most beautiful cere-
mony. To a class of 300 of the brightest
boys and girls of the parish the Arch-
bishop spoke long and kindly of the duties
i they were about to take up as Catholic
citizens in the highest sense. He dwelt
â¢ upon the things they had been
taught In their Catholic training, |
â  and pointed out to them how I
, they might best adapt themselves to ]
j ful speech, brimming over with kindness I
; children with as rapt attention as by
. their parents and relatives, who crowded
the big church to the doorways.
All through the next month there will
be special devotions at St. Patrick's, and
the most eloquent Catholic fathers of the
city will be heard from time to time.

CONDEMNED MOBS.
Rev. William Rader Delivers an Able
Sermon on the Recent Out-
rages in Georgia.
"Mobs and Government" was the sub-
ject of an Interesting address, delivered
by the Rev. William Rader last evening
before the members of the Third Congre-
gational Church. The sermon was based
, on the recent outrages committed in Geor- I
; gia by an infuriated moh and the speaker j
! condemned its lawless action. At the j
outset he said the mob crucified Christ,]
| reddened the streets of Paris and Ver- !
I sallies, blackened the name of Boston, I
j fired Philadelphia churches and disgraced I
| Chicago. It has lynched and burned and j
tortured both whites and blacks. In I
part he said: \
The burning of a negro in Georgia and th*> I
hanging of another on the evidence of the 1
first has brought the blush of shame to our
cheeks Such atrocities would make the Sultan |
of Turkey blush. The flames that consumed j
the wretch scorched the flag. For seven year:-) -
there has been on an average a negro burned i
for every year. The eight millions of negroes,
when educated. if that distant day ever comes, :
will make a rare conflict If they remain in j
i their Ignorance there will be a race war. |
Block Justice in the courts and you make a I
mob on the streets. The atrocity of the crimes I
i Incites the passions of men, which, influenced I
: by race hatred, develon the lynching mania.
Such fiends should be punished, not by lawless I
mobs but by lawful and speedy methods, Mobs I
: are anarchists. They are un-American. They I
sow seeds of lawlessness among the vicious j
' classes. The tendency toward lawlessness in
our country is seen in the fact that a San ]
; Francisco evening paper defends the atrocities
I of the South in a lengthy editorial. That is a ;
dangerous sign of the times.
! The remedy lies In a profounder respect for I
! law, as a principle of righteousness and as a i
method of Justice. Whenever an infuriated
populace takes the laws of a community into j
its own hands democracy Is defeated and the i
flag insulted. While we are expressing our hor-
ror at Spanish atrocities and respecting the 11- j
lustrious name of Dewey, let us remember that
self-government at home ls the surest guaran- !
tee to the world of our ability to govern abroad
and that to the extent of our Inability to place I
1 within the reach of the greatest wretch the j
instruments of .lustier- we shall become the j
I lauphing stock of the nations of the earth.

Opposition Does Not
Prove Acceptable.
THE LADIES ARE BLAMELESS
WORTHY CRUSADE AGAINST
VILE SALOONb.
Dens That Cost the City Very Many
Times the Amount Paid Into
the Treasury for
Licenses.
Oakland Offlce Pan Francisco Call, S
908 Broadway, April 29.
The action of the License Committee In
mending to the Council that no
liquor licenses be granted to houses where
minora have been served or crimes com
mltted; or which are known to he the re- I
sort of thieves and other disreputable
characters, is eminently proper, and is to !
be encouraged and commended. When
ever such a course has been suggested in ;
the past it has always been met by the
practice of applying for a license under
a new name, as though a dandelion would ,
smell like a rose because called one. The
habitues and environments of a saloon
determine Its character, and these are not
changed because the ex-proprietor be
comes the bartender and the nominal pro
prietor is never or seldom seen.
There tire in Oakland fully fifty dead
falls which should be closed and which !
are costing the clty many times the
amount of the license they put in the
treasury. They harbor the very worst
types of men and women; and give the
â¢ more trouble than a score of sa
foons decently conducted. Occasionally a j
murder, or attempted murder*, or crimes
equally henlous; are committed, and tho
city and county are put to great expense
in "trying the cases, which would never
have "come up but for these dens. The
abolishing of such places would be a wise
economy. ____________
Mayor Snow has In his possession a ''.
statement from two lads now awaiting
trial for burglary, in which they tell him
*f the particular saloon where their crime
was hatched, and where they were served
with liquor, although both are minors.
Any man who would vote to continue
a license to such a house is unworthy of
a seat in the City Council or anywhere
else outside the pillory of public indigna
tion and contempt.
The Supervisors will meet to-morow,
nnd if they do what is requested of them
they will revoke the license of the notori
ous Thalia saloon on the San leandro
road. This place was, a few days ago,
the scene of a most diabolical orgy. The
details have been suppressed, but enough |
is known to justify very peremptory ac- i
tion. This is not the first time that this i
resort has been a scene of bloodshed;
but decency demands that the affair of
last Sunday shall be the last. ;
I have no patience with that large class '
of people who live by their wits and who j
are forever opposing any attempt to pro
mote decency and order on the ground
that it Is a movement to make Oakland a
"blue-law" town. Such a suggestion is I
as ridiculous as it is insincere. Because
an effort be made to close a number of
notorious haunts of vice, there is no sense
in declaring that prohibition Is the end in ,
view; because vile keno dens are driven
out to Emeryville is no argument that
every place of legitimate amusement is
being turned into ii prayer-mi
house; because vagrants, hoodlums anil
tinhorn gamblers are compelled to move
on or out is surely no excuse for saving
that no one can live in peace in this city. i
Vet this is the view taken by those who i
would subvert every attempt to suppress
vir.> nd to maintain law and to prevent '
high school students and others from that
class being exposed to temptations which
they have nut experience enough to
understand.
Rev. Dr. Sunderland has published a j
CLUBMAN,ACTRESS
AND CARNATIONS
cÂ» -
â¢ '<
â¦
.Â» \f) ESTFRDAY was a cold and dreary day in more ways than the literal
â¦ \y on Â° for a certain well-known clubman. He remained at home during tho
.â¢ J entire day and evening, not daring to go to the club, for there he
1 would have been sure to meet those friends he had cordially hidden to
k* enjoy his triumphs, and who, by a strange turn i.i cordially wit
strange turn of fortui
/ nessed his defeat.
It happened on Saturday evening,
and not only the clubman's friends
jut the entire Orpheum audience are
gossiping about the swell and the
long-stemmed carnations he ordered
sent to Miss Rurkhart over the foot
lightsâand which she refused to ac
cept
Miss Rurkhart herself refuses to
discuss the incident. "He was just
a foolish man," she said, and then
ho showed two perfect rows of
pearly teeth and twisted her full, ex
pressive lips in a most tantalizing
manner.
"The front of tho house" have none
of Miss Burkhart's charitable discre
tion, and told the tale to all who cared
to listen and learn. This is the man
agement's version of the exciting epi
sode: A well-known clubman, dilet
tante, and admirer of all things beau
tiful in art and nature, on Saturday
afternoon loft at the Orpheum box
office a note for the fetching Miss
Rurkhart that told of his admiration
of the lady and her talent, incident
ally touch* upon his own exalted so
la! position and which concluded by
saying that he would that evening
send her a bunch of carnations, that
would be handed to her over the foet
id lights. "If I may have the rare pleasure of escorting you to supperâ after
,* the performanceâ lake one of my carna" â ' ~"* ** *" *"â¢"Â«â¢ v*air"
*^ the note added, and the clubman came |
Â£â¢ with his friends, all in on the secret, J
V to see Miss Rurkhart "put the car- !
4 * nation in her hair." j
* Mi..; i iurkhart'- playlet ended. Tho
â¢ t Â» usher, keeping stop to the music of
. applause that greeted the little lady,
gÂ» dashed to the stage and held th* car-
nations toward her. Miss Burkhart
rÂ» shook her head. Th" curtain fell. j
v Again the audience thundered, de
i? manding the curtain be raised again
* so the charming actress could get
\ those carnations that they imagined
Â£â¢ she had overlooked^ Up again went
4 the curtain, but the lily-white hand
i^ did not reach for the flowers, and the
* usher ing them on the stage just as
â¢I' the curtain once again fell.
r. The clubman was puzzled. His
V friends smlied mysteriously. When
'.*, the orchestra came out from under
f * the stage and each man, from Leader
â¢' Rosener down, had a carnation In his
r . buttonhole, and the stagehands were
*' seen peeking from the wings each
Â mother's son's coat decorated with a
â¢-" carnation, the clubman fled.
* The clubman's friends Saturday
k.- evening drank to Miss Burkhart's
% health. The clubman paid for the b >t
<â ? ties.

Practical variation of an old adage. He
has evidently heard somewhere that there
is a torrid place which is paved with good
intentions. He makes the application to
Fablola's Derby day and very aptly.
Many well-meaning folk have inadver
tently created the impression that the
ladies who conduct that magnificent insti
tution have locked hands with the ele
ments of viciousness and have entered
into a contract to boom and extend the
manifest evils of the racetrack. This is
absurd, but not an altogether unreason
able deduction. The ladles of Fabiola
have but one object in the premisesâ the
welfare of Fabiola, and If some other
source of benefit can be devised the
ladies will most willingly accept It. Dr.
Sunderland says that it is all very well
for the Christians to stand up in prayer
meeting and denounce Fabiola dayâ such
efforts are easy, but offer no remedy. He
proposes that 'all unite in raising a sum
annually equal to the amount received
from Fabiola day and then the Purpose of
such protest is accomplished. This is
right. Oakland Is guilty of too much re
solving and subsequent inactivity. * â¢ ,
There Is something remarkably logical
in Dr. Sunderland's suggestion, and it will
no donbt appeal to the i lies of t-abiota.
Argument on such a question is vain.
Conviction can only be arrived at from a
knowledge of practical example. There
a?e many among the budding manhood
and womanhood of our society who un
doubtedly take advantage of Fabiola day
to obtain their first experience of the
racetrack. If it could be proved that
vAbnc- Wldber were one of- these would
kny n human being dare defend Fabiola
|'v. b n ,l can it be proved that such oc
casions hpve not laid the foundations for
more than one such career?
I do not think the disseminators of vice
at Fmerv ville will receive another annual
metaphorical certificate of character from
Fablola's friends. The remedy is solely
in the hands of those who would sup
press it.
The manner in which a grand jury can
be persuaded to take up an alleged griev
ance, which is based on purely personal
motives, is rlalnly shown in the case of
ex-Coroner Evers. Some years ago a
grand jury declared that Mr. Kvers had
overcharged the county about $120*3 dur
ing his term of oflice. It now appears
that Coroners for years before Mr. Evers
was elected, the Coroner that succeeded
him and the present Coroner have made
exactly the same charges. Yet Evers
was put to heavy expense to defend him
self from these "suits, while the charges
i*re still ing made and successive grand
iuries have not thought lit to make any
more indictments. Why Evers should
have been singled out would no doubt
make a good story.
Thursday night a cultured, though
very small audience at the Macdonough,
was quietly rebuked by the artist Rosen
thal. During the rendition of a number
was heard the squeaking of a pair of boots
in the balcony, where are supposed to be
seated the genuine music lovers. The
pianist refused to play in competition to
boots. He stopped abruptly. The squeaks
kept on, then subsided. The pianist re
sumed, and Oakland people were made
aware of the fact that if they could not
support an artist for one night at the
Macdonough, neither could they annoy
him. When the Macdonuogh has added a
dispel for people who must cough
and a conversation room for people who
must talk after coming to the theater,
then it wil indeed be a model playhouse.
It was quite too bad that this modern
Athens should have suffered such a re
buke on account of the carelessness of
one "music lover."
What ls the value of a Jury? This ques
tion is brought up by the remarkable ex
hibition of injustice meted out in Justice
Quinn's court last Thursday. There were
six jurors and supposedly six mini and
intellects. There might have been two.
but. there were no more, or else, as the
Court said,* there was corruption and
crookedness. When the two referred to
have, been determined the other four are
at liberty to attempt to receive $10>)
apiece by the grace of one Morehouse of
the late unlamentcd Legislature.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 1,1899.
NO NEED TO
PAY INTEREST
FOR SALARIES
Treasurer Gilpin Has
a Scheme.
WORKED WELL YEARS AGO
LAKE MERRITT FUND MAY NOT
BE SACRED.
Work Done After June May Have to
Paid for From the Income for
the Next Fiscal
Year.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 30.
"If I were permitted to act I could fix
matters in flve minutes so that no em
ploye of the city would have to pay 8
per cent interest, or any interest, to any
bank on his salary Warrants for the next
few months," said Treasurer Gilpin.
The prospect of every employe of the
city of Oakland having to pay 8 per cent
interest to some bank for the purpose
of drawing salary on their warrants, un
til some money is received after next
July, is causing considerable worry at the
City Hall. Mr. Gilpin, who has handled
the city cash for ten years, says he can
adjust matters if permitted to do so, al
though his methods might be considered
to be not in harmony with the law. The
method, however, was in force for many
years, and during that time the banks
cashed warrants at their face value, with
out any interest.
About three years ago the City Council
passed an order that no city money was
to be put on deposit in the local banks,
nut that the city, not having a fire-proof
vault of its own, should rent a deposit
box in one of the banks and hoard its
money in it. Since that time no money
has been on deposit in banks, and conse
quently the banks are under no obliga
tion to the city to cash warrants without
interest. There is now in the city's de
posit box a sum of money sufficiently
large to enable all salary warrants to be
paid at tin face value, If the Treasurer
be permitted to carry into effect his lit
tle scheme, which is to take the money
from the box and put it on deposit. The
banks then, having the use of the money,
would make It earn the interest which
they would otherwise charge the em
ployes.
The county of Alameda has done for
years past just what Mr. Gilpin wants to
do, and thing has been said. In the
case of the county there Is not the excuse
of there being no adequate treasury in
which to keep it, and yet here is never
a time when there is not from a quarter
to a half million dollars of the county's
funds In the local hanks.
There is also some doubt as to whether
the $48,000 now held to pay for the work
on Lake Merritt can be retained for that :
purpose after June 30, if the Council shall
undertake to transfer it to the salary
fund, and the law permits. After June
30 it is calculated that at least $30,
of this fund will not have been earned,
and consequently the work done after
that date will ii*- chargeable to the in
come of the city for the next fiscal year. }
There are differences of opinion regarding >
this trasfer of funds, but everybody seems
willing to strain a point if all the em
ployes can be saved from having to pay
8 per cent interest on their warrants,
especially now that after May 1 nearly
all such warrants have already been re
duced 25 per cent by ordinance.
THE AX HAS FALLEN.
The First Slash Strikes City Electric
Light Employes.
ALAMEDA, April 30.â The political ax
has fallen and as announced in The Call
the first blow has struck the municipal
electric light works. li: an effort to re
duce expenses and isolate the account of
the works from all oth* i bran* I of the
city government a complete overhauling
of the working force has taken plat
Rut one man has thus far lost his official
head, but it is stated i ha : as soon as the
electric light committee, composed of
city Trustees. Schulte and Mackle, thor
oughly familiarize themselves with the
conditions surrounding tho city light
plant the ax will make deeper slashes
among tho employes. William Carlson,
assistant fireman, has boon dropped from
the payroll. Fireman James Davis will
in future have no assislai and .-,)] be
forced to do duty for < [even hours at a
stretch.
Al Fisher, who occupied the dual posi
tion of collector and engine wiper, has
been relieved of the latter part of his
work, and Instead has been placed In
charge of the accounts of he plant, for
merly kept by City Clerk Lumhorn. En
gineer J. O. Messer will be given -..â > as
sistance in the engine room and will be
forced to work about twelve hours a day
tc keep the machinery in proper shape.
For some time there has been a little
difference of opinion existing between
Messer and Electrician <".. A. Weise. The
City Trustees have also taken this matter
in hand. Messer and Weiso have been
given positive orders to shake hand and

THE OLYMPIC
TRY-OUT WAS A
GREAT SUCCESS
Wind and Rain No
Bar to Cycling.
PREPARING FOR RELAY RACE
ONLY FOUR TEAMS WILL CON
TEST THIS YEAR.
Thirty-Two Riders Go Over tho
Courses in the Mud Across
the Bayâ The Re
sults.
The rain of yesterday did not prevent
the hardy road riders of the Olympic
and Bay City clubs from holding their I
last try-outs preliminary to the great an- ;
nual relay race.
The Olympics rode fourteen men over 1
the 10-mile triangle course, starting from
a point near San Leandro, while the Bay
Cltys put eighteen of their best and speed
iest over the five-mile course from San
Leandro to Haywards.
The rain, which commenced falling just !
as the club men reached San Leandro,
drenched the enthusiastic riders, their j
thin racing suits doing admirable service
at bathing apparel. But with the relay
race only two weeks in the future and
with the absolute necessity of picking out
men for the teams, mud and rain did not
daunt the hardy roadsters.
C. S. Myrick officiated as starter for
the Olympic race, the men starting two \
minutes apart and riding unpaced. The
summary Is as follows:

Captain Agnew of the Acme Wheelmen
of Oakland had a little try-out for a few
of his men, reversing '.he usual order of
things and riding from San Leandro to
High street, thus taking' advantage of the
wind, though not escaping the rain.
Boy Whitson. a new rider from the
East, ls expected to do much for the
Acme team in the relay.
It is now a definite fact that there will
be but four teams in the race this year â 1
the Olympic, Bay City, Acme and Garden
City. â  _r= I

the foremost and most able practioner of
pure and honest clairvoyancy in tins country.
Five minutes spent with nim will convince
every skeptic that he has nothing in common
with that class of so-called "mediums" that
invest every city in this country Without
asking a single question he reveals your
past, present and luture life, culling your
mends and enemies by full name. He h-lps
the unfortunate and lends his power (which
is stronger than that of any medium now
in San Francisco) to help every caller to
succeed in the realization of their desires.
Unhappy lovers, unsuccessful business men,
those inflicted with so-called "incurable"
diseases, will find Proiessor Dubois a true
friend who will set them arignt and help
them to their success and happiness.
No matter what your trouble may be, con-
sult Professor Dubois and you will depart
thoroughly satisfied that there Is at least
one reliable medium now in your city.
Professor Dubois' charges are moderate,
and within the reach of all. The small fee
of $1 charged on all consultations. Daily
and Sunday, 10 a. m. to 7 p. m. Absoluts

tain $1 if answer is expected. Palmistry

WITTMAN AND
MORAN MEET AS
STRANGERS
Trouble Between the
Two Captains.
WERE FRIENDS FOR YEARS
COULD NOT STAND HIS SEVERE
CRITICISM.
The Property Clerk Demands of
Chief Lees to Prefer Charges
Against "Handsome
George."
Captain Wittman of the Central station
and Captain Moran, the Property Clerk
of the Police Department, are no longer
friends. In a moment of anger the
Central station captain referred in a dis
respectful manner to Moran, and as the
result they do not speak as they pass by.
The incident which brought about the
strained relations which now exist be
tween the two police officials occurred in
Moran's offlce. Wittman. accompanied by
several of his men, at the conclusion of
the hearing of the Junction proceedings
instituted by the Pacific Coast Jo* key
Club against Chief I_*-*-s. visited the Prop
erty Clerk's otlice and instructed Moran
to have the evidence in the case ready by
the following morning. While Wittman
was dilating on the necessity of having
the evidence ready, Moran stood among
the group of policemen nodding assent to
what the Central station captain was say
ing. Suddenly stopping in the rriiast of
his remarKs Wittman savagely turned on
Moran nnd accused him of humorously
treating him.
"This is no joke." he hotly declared, his
face Hushed with anger. "You can
shake your head; hut it don't go with
me."
Moran was so astonished at the declara
tion of Wittman that ho could not think
nf a reply. Trembling with suppressed
anger Moran walked out of his office,
leaving Wittmann to finish his remarks
about the evidence in the case to his
squad of officers.
Th. following day the two captains met
in Chief Lees' office. Still smarting under
th*- humiliation of being degraded by a
man of the same rank, Moran dramatic
ally pointed his finger at Wittman, and
addressing Chief Lees, said:
â¢â I d< mand of you to prefer charges of
disrespect against Captain Wittman. In
the presence of his men he not only de
graded mo. but by Innuendo accused mo
of trying to suppress the evidence in the
Injunction proceedings Instituted by the
Pacific Coast Jcol-ey * 'Ill."
Still pointing his finger at the Central
station captain, who had become speech
less by the suddenness of the attack,
Moran declared that even the policemen
who had heard the burning words of con
demnation of their superior. officer subse
quently came to him and extended their
svmpa'thv.
"They wanted to apologize for this
man's conduct." remarked Moran. "as
they fully realized that he had made an
unwarranted and brutal attack on me."
By this time Wittman had recovered
his powor of speech, and, facing Moran,
demanded to know the names of the po
licemen who wanted to sympathize with
him.
"That is mv business." hotly retorted
Moran. "You will have to get their names
from them."
"You're only making a bluff." angrily
remarked Wittman. "You ought, to con
fine yourself to the facts."
"1 have a witness, a responsible person,
who is hero an.l will corroborate what I
say." testily answered Moran.
Turning to Chief T.ees he again de
manded that he prefer charges against
the Central station captain. While the
head of the department was deprecating
the occurrence Moran turned to Witt
man and declared that he did not want
to know him in the future.
"We moot as captains of police," he re
marked, "but as friends, never."
"I have been in this department for over
twenty years. and not once have I been
before the Police Commissioners, charged
with misconduct. T am sorry to say that
you cannot boast of the same record."
Moran was about to refer to the bribery
charges-- which were brought against
"Witt! and which were dismissed by
the Police Commissioners, when Chief
Lees called a halt. Both men then left
Lees' offlce ami went to heir respective
departments. Xow they meet as strangers
âone revengeful nd the other awaiting
an opportunity to strike back.
SOUTHERN OUTRAGES.
Bey. T. Brown of the A. M. E. Zion
Church Proclaims Against
Them.
Rev. T. Brown, pastor of Starr Kin?
African Methodist Episcopal Zlon Church,
delivered an address last night on the
recent, inhuman lynching tragedies com
mitted in Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and
elsewhere in the South. He Inveighed bit
terly against the brutal outrages, which
he characterized as the most awful and
. horrible in the most civilized age known
In the world's history.
"The Egyptian bondage of the Jews for
43*1 years." the reverend speaker said In
the course of his remarks, "cannot be
compared with the barbarity going on in
our own Christian land. The murder of
Bam Hose by burning him to a stake for
a supposed crime is a disgrace to the
civilization of America. The murder of
the aged preacher Strickland by lynch
ing and the cutting up of the bod!' as
souvenirs is the essence of barbarism. It
appears that Christ and the colored man
nre the only two beings who have not the
friendship of the world. It gives rise to
the question, 'Shall the United States con
tinue to be the colored man's home or
shall he look for another?'
"Give the colored man protection or
give him death. No people have done
more to build up the great commonwealth
than the colored Americans. The negroes
fought loyally for the. old flag, but the
old flag cannot protect them. In four
great national wars the colored man took
an active part. He has never yet proved
a traitor, yet he is murdered and the
general Government looks calmly on. Tie
can only protect himself by racial unity.
"I hope the time is not far distant "â¢ en
the tree of peace shall spread its broad
branches over tiie land: that there will
Tie no more lynching and nil men will he
living in perfect national peace every
where."

DEATH STAYED
THE ARM OF
THE SUICIDE
Remarkable End of
H. L. Kirchoff.
HIS REMAINS TO SCIENCE
DIED FROM ASTHMA WITH
POISON AT HIS SIDE.
A Letter to the Coroner Shows That
He Had Intended to
Take the Fatal
Draught.
. -
The taking off of H. If. Kirchoff ln a
id-street lodging house yesterday
afternoon brought to light one of the most
peculair cases the Coroner's office has
been called upon to handle for a . long
time. Everything goes to show that the
man, driven to desperation by poverty
and sickness, had intended taking his
own life. At the last moment death
stayed the suicide's arm, and the man
for whom life held nothing more was
taken away.
When the landlady went to Kirchoff'p
room yesterday morning she met no re
sponse to repeated knocks. Thinking
that her lodger, whom she knew to be in
poor health, had mercifully fallen into a
refreshing sleep, she went away. In the
afternoon she called again, but could get
no answer. The door was finally forced
open and Kirchoff was found lying still
and cold upon the bed. On a table at his
head was a bottle of laudanum, and be
si*!. it the following remarkable letter:
Dear â oner: In case I should he found
dead blame no one hut myself. I am suffering
with an incurable sickness known as asthma-
There is no cure for it and the suffering is un
bearable. My money Is gone anil death will
be welcome. I have no friends or relatives
(.live my hody to the doctors. Let them cut
it up. They can learn something from me. I
have been ruptured for forty-two years and
have a skin that no other man has.
H. L. KIRCHOFF.
Another letter was drawn up in the
form of a will. In it he bequeathed all
his personal belongings a lit
tle furniture and some beds and bed
clothing to Mrs. E. Badger of 74.A Natoma
street for attending him. both while he
was ill at her former residence, 115 Second
street, ami since that time. He also
stated that I;.- owed nothing, either to the
landlady or nny one else. lb- was 72
years of age. and according to his own
statement had no relatives living.
BAINTALL WAS LIGHT.
San Francisco Is Given a Slight Wet-
ting With Plenty of Wind.
Rain began falling in San Francisco at
4 a. m. yesterday and continued intermit
tently until shortly after noon, but the
j precipitation was light. The storm start
ed on the coast of Washington and
' worked its way south along the coast as
â¢ far as Tehachapi, extending also into the
interior, with a light fall of snow in the
foothills. The wind blew with consider
able violence all day, reaching its great
est velocity at about 10 a. m., when the
gauge on the top of the Mills building
registered thirty-four miles an hour. At
5 p. m. it was blowing twenty-four miles
an hour. On Mount Tamalpais the wind
blew fifty miles an hour. Forecaster Mc
: Adie says the storm is over for the pres-
I ent and there will be no rain to-day, al
though the indications are that the wind
will blow and the weather will continue
cool.

GROSSER OF
THE RUBICON
HAS ARRIVED
General Harrison G.
Otis on Politics.
AFFAIRS IN THE PHILIPPINES
â 
WILL LEAVE FOR LOS AN
GELES IMMEDIATELY.
The General Thinks the War in
the Far East Will Be Ended
in a Very Few
Weeks.
The modern Caesar has arrived. The
valiant brigadier from the Southland,
whose cablegram from Manila announc
ing that he had "crossed the Rubicon"
thrilled the hearts and sent the blood
leaping with Joyous bounds through the
veins of his vassals in Los Angeles is
here, having reached this port on the
transport Sherman en route to his home,
where 3 reception befitting his deeds of
daring on the bloody battlefields of the
Far East awaits him.
General Harrison Gray Otis' achieve
ments in the Philippine campaign are
current history, but the deed which is
destined to send his name echoing down
the corridors of time is his daring emu
lation of the Roman conqueror. With a
single stroke of the pen he put himself on
a plane far above all other military heroes
of the epoch and took his place on the
pinnacle of fame along with the greatest
heroes of ancient and modern times.
Lawton, Mac Arthur, Wheaton and the
namesake of this nineteenth century
Caesar may win battles, as they are doing
daily and batter the half-saVage Tagallos
into submission to Uncle Sam, but their
victories pale in comparison with the
feat of Harrison Gray Otis of Los Ange
les. They are not the only generals who
have the abality to win battles, but who
save he could cross the Rubicon without
getting wet.
But what has. induced this warrior of
Los Angeles to leave the scene of war
where glory is to be bought at the can
non's mouth? Why return to the land or
peace and orange blossoms? The whisper
comes from the South that politics is the
moving cause; that the newly-created
Caesar must leave the hard field of noisy
battle for the soft endeavors of politics.
"I have returned because my business
and civil interests demanded it." said
General Otis yesterday afternoon as he
stamped up and down the reading room
of the Occidental Hotel. "J have not
given politics any thought, and. if I had,
what of it?. You ask me if 1 intend going
as a delegate at large to the next Na
tional Republican convention? It is ab
surd to figure on anything so far in ad
vance. I do not wish to say anything
more on that matter. If you wish to
know anything about the Philippines, I
will most willingly edify you. I think
that the war in the Philippine Islands is
about ended. The natives have neither
supplies nor ammunition. They are with
out discipline, order or leaders, and they
can not last more than a few weeks at
the most. The war is practically over."
The general showed great pertuhatlon
of mind when the subject of politics was |
again approached, and he would have no :
more of it. _________________
DEWEY DAY FEATURES AT
CATHOLIC LADIES' FAIR
PATRIOTIC SONGS AND RECITA
TIONS WILL BE GIVEN.
The Voting Contest for the Most Pop
ular Policeman or Fireman
Gaining in Interest.
Dewey day will be appropriately cele
brated at the Catholic Ladles' Aid So
ciety's bazaar, a special programme in
cluding many pleasing features having
been arranged for the occasion. .To-night
will be "Native Sons' and Daughters'
night," and Dennis Foley's orchestra of
twelve pieces will render patriotic music
gratuitously; Mr. Gildea will sing origi
nal compositions on Admiral -Dewey; Mr.
Morrisey will â¢ recite, and Mrs. Fitzsim
mons will render patriotic selections on

in each department. A total of 782 votes
have been cast, and of these Sergeant J.

ity of votes when the polls close on Sat
urday night. The fair is gaining in pop
ularity daily, and it is almost certain to
prove the financial success that was ex
pected for it. '*.-"â¢.â¢
A MISSION PANHANDLE.
Superintendent McLaren's Scheme to
Make a Boulevard of Dolores
Street.
Park Superintendent McLaren has hit
upon a plan, devised during the rainy
days when the park was deserted, as
yesterday, that will loubtless please the
people of the Mission and be a great ad
dition to the present scheme to extend the
panhandle to Van Ness avenue. Mr. Mc-
Laren is of the opinion that Dolores
Street, which is wide and for a long way
out into the Mission is free from car
tracks, should be made into a boulevard
and trees set along the curb as far out as
Twenty-sixth street. Then Buchanan
street at the junction of that thorough
fare and Dolores should be widened also
into a boulevard to the proposed exten
sion of the panhandle. This would give
the people of the Mission a panhandle to
the park.
The park was deserted yesterday. It
was free day for the children at the
Chutes, as it will be to-day, and hundreds
of youngsters enjoyed themselves. The
baby monkey will be named to-day and
the winner of this novel contest will take
home either a bicycle or sewing machine.
At Sutro's Baths the Japanese troupe
of acrobats and expert swimmers enter
tained the guests. Following are the re
sults of the aquatic contests: 50-yard
dash, for novices, won by R. Bedford,
J. O'Brien second; 50-yard dash, for ju
veniles, won by C, Donovan. R. Bedford
second; 170-yard dash, for amateurs, won
by W. Hurley, R. Dahl second: high div
ing, won by O. Schulte; trapeze diving,
won by Pi 1 Guerin, O. Bey f us second.
