GENERAL MILLER BEATS
PANAY ISLAND REBELS
ILOILO, March 17, via Manila. March
20.â A battalion of the Eighteenth
Infantry, a platoon of the Sixth Ar
tillery and a machine gun battery
made a reconnoissance in th* direc
tion of Mandurrioa and Santa Barbara
yesterday. While they were returning
the insurgents attacked their outposts
on the right.
Although fatigued from marching in
the hot sun for two hours, the entire
command proceeded to the assistance
of their comrades, the artillery pouring
shell and shrapnel upon the Insurgents,
who were strongly, intrenched and in
large force.
Companies C, H and X of the Eight
eenth deployed to the right, driving the
insurgents back, and then wheeling to
the left made a juncture with Compa
nies B and I. A heavy engagement en
sued. Companies B. C. M and J of the
Tennessee Volunteers, Major Cheat
ham commanding, arrived later and
formed on the left, and two more com
panies of the Eighteenth marched from
Iloilo to act as a -support to the other
troops. Colonel Van Valzah and Major
Keller commanded the battalions of the
Eighteenth Regiment.
General Miller was on the scene early
and directed operations from imme
diately behind the fighting line. He
had several narrow escapes. The line
advanced by rushes for 3000 yards un
der a hot fire, pouring in deliberate vol
leys upon the enemy's position, the ar
tillery making good practice. By the
time the American forces were within
SOO yards of the enemy- final position
darkness fell, preventing the charge.
for which the Tennessee men and the
companies of the Eighteenth on the
right had already prepared by fixing
bayonets. Our retirement upon Jaro
was accomplished In â¢-'ood order.
The engagement was brought on by
the enemy's persistent attacks upon our
outpost at Jaro bridge* Nothing could
be gained by forcing the enemy back
farther, as -it was impossible with our
limited number of troops to hold the
position. The American troops were
exhausted by fighting and â¢ having to
wade knee deep through rice fields and
sugar cane. There were several cases
of prostration by heat.
The only man killed was Private

FIRST CABLEGRAM
DIRECT FROM ILOILO
NEW YORK, March 20.â dispatch herewith is doubtless the first
sent by cable direct from Iloilo since the war began. Formerly an over
land telegraph line connected Iloilo with the cable which touched the isl
and of Panay on the north coast. The Eastern Extension Cable Company
has now run a loop from the original cable around the coast to the port,
held by the Americans. The Call-Herald correspondent has promptly
availed himself of the reopening of communication by cabling a descrip
tion of the fierce engagement outside Iloilo.

Infantry-
The wounded of the Eighteenth were:
Privates Joseph Daly, knee and
thigh; Theodore Burr, arm and chest;
Preston Savage, forearm; William
Brushechke, chest, all of. Company B.

Corporal C. E. Bates, foot. Com
pany I-
Private T. A. Marlowe of Company L,
First California, serving with the ar
tillery, was wounded in the side and
back and Private Samuels of Com
pany F, Tennessee Volunteers, was
slightly wounded in the face.
The bullet passed through Roven
berger's wrist and entered his mouth
between the gum and cheek without
injuring his head. There were other
miraculous escapes, as the men ad
vanced amid a perfect hail of bullets.
The severity of the engagement may be
judged by the fact that the Eighteenth
Regiment alone fired 62.800 rounds. It
is estimated that the insurgents with
"their more than 2000 rifles fired more
than cur total of ammunition.
Private Biehl was brought in badly
wounded and gave warning to hurry
up some ammunition, as most of the
men were short. He then returned to
the fighting line and was struck in the
chest. He fell saying, "I'm done for,"
and died in ten minutes.
It is impossible to tell accurately the
Insurgents' losses, as the American
troops converged at a given point with
out traversing the ground shot over,
but to-day, from Jaro belfry. I could
see the enemy carting away their dead.
The minimum estimate of their losses
is two hundred killed and three hun
dred wounded. The evolutions were
prettily executed and the highest credit
is due battalion and company com
manders.
The men are chafing at being robbed
of the fruits of their victory., A charge
would probably have resulted in the
capture of the enemy's arms and am
munition, but from the configuration of
the ground and the position of our
troops it -was impossible to allow an
advance in the darkness. â 
The behavior of the troops was ad
mirable.
There has been only desultory out
post shooting since this engagement.
The following instructions were found
on cases of ammunition captured:

from Germany and Japanese sources
and the French colonies. The city is
quiet and business is reviving.

DEWEY SAYS INSURRECTION
IS ALREADY BREAKING UP
NEW YORK, March 20.â A special

â¢Admiral Dewey said to the Journal cor
respondent to-day: â  â¢
"I believe that the Tagallo ipsurrec-

tion is already breaking up. General
Wheaton's column could take Malolos,
the insurgent capital, by a good dash.
The main part of the insurrection lies
between Manila and Malolos. There is
practically no opposition to the United
States authority . in the southern isl
ands. The natives there hate the Ta
gallos and are really anxious to wel
come us.
"The Tagallo is half devil and half
child. Eradicate the devil and you have
only a child to govern. The strength of
the enemy has been greatly overesti
mated. The insurgents are finding out
that "in warfare as in a great many
other things the power of money -is al
most irresistible. .". . '
"If the Spaniards put down an insur
rection here, surely we can do the same.
We are strong enough to hold these
Islands without foreign alliance. With
the Oregon, lowa, Monterey and Mo
nadnoek we could face any possible
complication."

Aguinaldo Cuts Off the Heads of His
Chiefs Who Differ From
Him.
MANILA, March 20, 4:45 p. m.â The
First battalion, Captain O'Neil's, of the
California regiment, under Lieutenant
Colonel Duboce, has been ordered to
embark on the. lndiana to-morrow in
order to reinforce the garrisons of the
towns of Bais and Baguyan, on the
east coast of the island of Negros,
where Colonel Smith is in command.
This is only a measure of precaution,
as Major General Otis says he does not
anticipate trouble there. '
Aguinaldo is taking extreme meas
ures to suppress all movements calcu
lated to cause a cessation of hostilities.
Twelve adherents of the plan of inde
pendence, residents of Manila, have
been condemned to death because they
wrote advising surrender and all loyal
Filipinos have been called upon to per
form the national service of dispatch
ing them.
On Friday last General La Oarda. at
'one time Aguinaldo's Secretary of "War,
visited La Gordas for the purpose of
advising Aguinaldo to quit. He argued
with the insurgent leader and attempt
ed to convince him of the folly of his
persistence in the face of overwhelm
ing odds. Aguinaldo was furious at the
advice and ordered General La Garda
to be executed immediately. The un
fortunate general was promptly decapi
tated.
Among the incidents of yesterday's
fighting was the coolness exhibited by
a company of the Washington Volun
teers who crossed the river in a native
canoe under a heavy fire, fifteen being
taken across ?on each trip of the small
boat, to attack the enemy's trenches.
The inability of the commissary train
to keep up with the advance led to .con
siderable suffering, and many of the
men were completely exhausted when
they were recalled and, falling from the
ranks, were strung along for _ distance
' of almost six miles, numbers returning
| to camp in the' artillery ambulances,
: which were always close up to the lines.
The work of the ambulances was. es
j pecially worthy of mention.

FLYING BRIGADE WORKS
UNDER HARD CONDITIONS
HONGKONG, March 20.â A corre
spondent of the Associated Press at
Manila says:
An arm-v has seldom operated under
harder conditions than have been en
countered .by the "American .flying bri
gade." The country the American troops
have traversed la intersected -by la- j
coons, narrow and unfordable. rivers and
bamboos so thick that the enemy cannot
he seen a hundred feet distant. During
the charges the Americans were ignorant
__ to whether they were attacking a him- !
dred or thousands of rebels, which amazes
the foreign observers.' The Filipinos were
unexpectedly fierce at Cainta. Had It<Â»ot
been for the fact that the American line |
was thin the enfilading fire would have |
slaughtered many of our men.
One of the prisoners captured by the
Americans says the Filipino leaders boast !
that they can conduct such a war for
years depending on the American forces
being weakened daily by twenty men
killed, wounded or invalided, ' â_-_.
Some of the high officials here think
that 10 000 reinforcements are needed, as
the troops now on this island are hardly
more than required to maintain a line
around Manila and police the city.
Considerable rain has fallen and it
teems that the season for rains is begin
ning prematurely. It is possible that when
the steady rains begin our troops will
have to be withdrawn to permanent bar
racks which will enable the rebels to re
turn to their old positions.
The Americans have refrained from de- :
stroying the buildings in the country
swept by General Wheaton's troops. A
sentry has been stationed before every
=tore at Pasig. but the soldiers are bring

AMERICAN LINER PARIS.
SLAYS HIS
FIVE YOUNG
CHILDREN
Most Atrocious Crime of a
Father at Hutchinson,
Kansas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HUTCHINSON, Kans., March 20.â
An atrocious crime .was revealed here
to-day when the Coroner and his as
sistants . removed the dead bodies of
five little children from the house oc
cupied by John Moore, which hurried at
an early hour. A Coroner's jury inves
tigated the case, and in accordance
with the jury's recommendation Moore,
the father of the dead children, was ar
rested on a charge of murder. The
tragedy has caused much excitement
here and there is some talk of lynching
the prisoner. However, a lynching Is
not looked for.
When the firemen and neighbors
reached the burning house the father
was the only member of the family of
seven found outside. His actions were
queer and he would not talk. While
the building was still burning and his
children were within the burning wal}s
he. took a horse from his stable and
rode away.
' When the firemen entered the house,
after having partly quenched the ;
flames, they found, the five children ly
ing side by side in a bed on the floor, all
dead but not badly burned. The dead
were: Carl, aged 12; Mary, aged 10;
Pearl, aged 8; Charles, aged 7. and Lee,
aged 3. â¢ '
The Coroner's autopsy, held this af
ternoon, developed convincing evidence
of an awful crime. The skull, of each
child was deeply indented and from the
dents long fractures extended. All but
oneof the children had been stabbed
in the neck. The throat of the little
3-year-old boy, a pretty boy, had been
slashed so deep that the spinal column
had been severed. â¢ ' â¢
It was upon these facts and the
strange behavior of the father that the
authorities base their charge of mur
der. ' .
When Moore was called before the
Coroner's jury to testify he pretended
to believe that an exploding lamp had
caused .the fire and ; that his children
had met death in the" flames. He tes
tified that he was awakened, from a
d.eep sleep by the smoke and that he
found the house afire all. over. It was
fifteen minutes, he said, before he re

MARTHA PLACE DIES
IN ELECTRIC CHAIR
NEW YORK, March 20.â Mrs.
Martha Place was executed at
Sing Sing Prison . to-day. She
was the first woman to die in
the electric chair in the State of
New York and she went to her death
quietly. Her death was instantaneous.
But two shocks were given. State Elec
trician Davis threw down the lever at
exactly 11:01 a. m. The voltage of the
current was 1760 and it was continued
for four seconds. It was then gradu
ally diminished to 200 voltage, which
was continued for fifty-six seconds. Dr.
Irvine, the physician of the prison,.ex
amined the woman and then ordered a
second shock. That was the same as
the first in power and continued for the
same length of time. The second shock
has always been administered at- Sing
Sing. .
Mrs. Place murdered her stepdaugh- [
ter, Ida M. Place, a mere girl, on Feb
ruary 7, IS9S. She first threw acid in
the girl's eyes and then -smothered her.
This was early in the. morning in their
home in Brooklyn. She waited the en
tire day for her husband to return and
then attacked him with an ax, fractur
ing his skull and otherwise seriously
injuring him. Place, however, re
covered.
Mi *s. Place was convicted and sen
tenced to' death, but she never for a
moment believed she would be electro
cuted. She at first claimed she could
remember nothing of the murder and
later the plea of insanity was submit
ted in her behalf. It was not until
â¢Thursday last that Warden Sage- an
nounced to her that Governor Roosevelt
had absolutely refused to interfere with
the course of justice and that she must
die on Monday. It was a great shock
to the woman, but during the last four
days she bore up wonderfully well. She
suffered in two ways after she learned
that she must die, from sleeplessness
and from loss of appetite. Again yes
terday the warden visited her So that
there might be no misunderstanding
and told her that she must be ready at
11 o'clock Monday morning.
She was ready at that hour, and no
one who watched her could understand
what change must have taken place in
the woman's nature to so dull her
senses that she could go to her death
so calmly and impassively." -It had
not been expected that she would do
60. The last woman condemned to die
in this State went to the gallows
shrieking and -fighting, but Mrs. Place
hardly uttered a sound. She merely
murmured a prayer, with closed eyes,
her face turned partly upward and
seemingly unconscious of things about
her.
This was the twenty-sixth" electrocu
tion at Sing Sing Prison, but none be
fore was so successful as that of to-,
day. Not only was there no scene, but
there was no delay. Within three min
utes after coming through the iron
doors the order of the law had been
carried out. There were -twelve wit
nesses present, and only those, who
watched every movement witnessed
Mrs. Place's death. Few were able to
see the raising of the body as the elec
trical shock passed through it. It was
only when the current was partly shut
off that they could see the body relax.
It was an easy way to die.
On Sunday Mrs. Place had her regu
lar attendants, and during the night
she was visited by her spiritual adviser,
Rev. Dr. David* Cole of Yonkers, and
Mrs. Meury, a mission worker of Brook
lyn, who has taken a great interest in
the woman's welfare. -
Mrs. Sage, the warden's wife, also
spent an hour or so with her, but at j
9:30 Mrs. Place was left alone with the
night matron, Mrs. Coultrick, with the
keepers in an Outer room. The con- ;
demned woman was very restless. Out- |
side a terrific gale was blowing which '
rattled the windows in the gloomy old
hospital building where Mrs. Place's I
quarters was located. There was a i
driving snow storm, too, and several ;
times the woman went to her window i
to watch the storm. She did not retire >
until 2:30, and after' that she was up
several times to pray. Never for a i
moment did the matron relax her vigil
ance. Mrs. Place was followed with
watchful eyes for the twenty-four \
hours that preceded her taking off.
It cannot be denied that Warden Sage j
was anxious in the extreme regarding
the execution and it was w'th this in
mind that he ordered every precaution '
taken to insure the best results. He sent
Rev. Dr. Cole to her at 9:15 this morn- \
ing. first inquiring whether the aged i
clergyman could stand the strain. Dr.
Cole assured him that he could, and |
was so full of sympathy for the woman i
he had known since she was a child j
-that he was anxious to be with her and !
comfort her to the end. Dr. Irvine also
visited her in the morning, and with I
him was a woman physician, who had |
been sent to attend the execution at j
SUPREME COURT
HEARS BRASLAN
Union Bank Director's
Petition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 20.â The legal
'wrangle relative to the closing of the
Union Savings Bank of San Jose has
fairly begun. The .heavy guns of the
Supreme . Court w ere brought into ac
tion in San Francisco to-day. This was
upon the consideration of the petition
for a writ of certiorari by Charles F.
Braslan, who wishes to have reviewed,
the recent action by Superior Judge
Lorigan in appointing a new board of
directors. The petition recites that the
bank in question is in the hands of the
lower court and the Bank Commis-
Bioners. At the time insolvency pro
-eeedings were " begun the ' board of
directors was served with the papers
In the proceedings. The directors re
signed one by one and a new board was
elected to fill the vacancies. Braslan
was one of the latter. On the Bth inst.
six of the directors elected by the
.stockholders resigned, but Braslan, the
seventh, held his office. Soon after
ward Judge Lorigan. of the Superior
Court 'made an order filling not only
the six vacancies but the position held
by Braslan.
It was this order that the petitioner
asked to have reviewed. He contended
that the action of the Judge of the
â¢lower court was illegal so far as he
was concerned, as he had been duly
elected by the stockholders and had
never been- removed from office by the
â¢parties in Interest, and. further, that
he is still a director. Another point
that Braslan makes Is that three of
the directors named by the Judge of
the lower court are not stockholders
and have no right to a voice in the. set
tlement of the affairs of the institution.
The contention is made that unless the
order of the 'lower court be set aside
the* suggestion of Governor Roosevelt.
Mrs. Sage was the last of her friends
to say good-by. During the last few
minutes of her life Mrs. Place
was again and again urged to go
bravely to her death, and she promised
that she would, i She told her pastor
that she believed that her sins had been
forgiven, and asserted her faith in the
hereafter. She was buoyed up with this
feeling when the warden came to lead
her to the chair. She was dressed in
black, a gown that she had made her
self, simple and plain. She had expect
ed to wear It at her new trial, or when
she received her liberty. .
A white band was. around her throat
and her light brown hair, now turning
gray, was brushed back smoothly over
her forehead. It was clipped away only
where the electrode was to be placed.
Mrs. Place said simply that she was
ready, and the warden took her arm in
his. They went slowly through the de
serted old hospital building, alone sev
eral hallways and finally through the
last corridor of all. On either side the
murderers' cells were draped with
heavy curtains, and the procession
moved more quickly through this dis
mal place.
Meanwhile the witnesses had been
called into the death chamber. The
electric apparatus had been given its
final test" and all were waiting with
suspense for the coming of the woman.
Suddenly the side door through which
the party would enter was thrown open,
a keeper stepped in and called for an
other keeper and turned rapidly away.
The keeper returned and was followed
almost at once by Mrs. Place, leaning
heavily on the warden's arm. Her face
was very white, her head uplifted and
her eyes closed. The white band
around her- throat seemed scarcely
whiter than her face.
The warden held her arm closely with
his and with his other, arm he sup
ported her. -Behind came, the women
attendants, one a physician and the
other a day matron. Rev. Dr. Cole
came next and after him were the two
keepers. As they came over the thres
hold Mrs. Place gave no- sign of fear,
nor did she even seem to know what
was about to happen. She passed al
most like a blind woman across' the
short space that separated her from,
death. She was gently pressed down
into the frame, and Dr. Irvine, who was
In waiting, stepped in front of her. He
motioned to the women and they, came
up on either side. It took but a moment
to strap her in. The edge of her skirts
was lifted quickly, the stocking drawn
down over her shoe and the electfode
fastened by one of the women to the'
right leg. Then the skirt was dropped.
The head cap 'was clamped on, the
straps buckled across the face and the
pad dropped over the forehead. The
two women stood with outstretched
the Bank Commissioners will turn over
to the alien board of directors all of the
property of the bank, to the injury of
the stockholders. .vs_'&
When the petition came before the
higher court to-day Attorney General
Tlrey L. Ford represented â¢the Judge
of the Santa Clara court, the Bank
Commissioners and the new board .of
directors. His first move was to attack
the right of Braslan to take the matter
into the court upon a writ of certiorari.
He claimed' Braslan was not a director,
and consequently had no standing In
the court. When action was begun in.
the lower court all of the directors were
served with the pikers in the liaulda
tion action, and if Braslan was not
served with the liquidation of the bank
he was not subject to the order of the
court, and consequently his relief, if
he had any, would lie in Injunction,
mandamus or quo warranto proceed
ings. Mr. Ford further contended that
the order appointing the new board of
directors was not a judicial order,
hence this was not a judicial proceed
ing to be reviewed. As to the appoint
ment of directors not stockholders,
that was a matter purely discretionary
with the court, which was conceded to
look after the best Interests of the
stockholders. S-t-'v?':-.?;*
Attorney Metson represented Mr.
Braslan. He made an able argument
to show that the order of the Judge of
the lower court was a judicial order
and therefore subject to review, and
that unless it were reviewed and the
new board ousted the interests of the
stockholders would suffer.
The Supreme Court Justices took the
case under consideration.
Louis Callisch, Amasa Eaton and Cy
rus Jones to-day' filed withdrawals of
their resignations with the County
Clerk. They! were elected directors of
the bank after the failure, hut subse
quently resigned and were reappointed
by Lorigan. , Their action would indi
cate they think the Supreme Court will
overrule Judge Lorigan's action. Nich
olas BowdenJ another . director.' asked
that, in case, the appointment of the
(present board of directors be declared
void, his resignation be considered
withdrawn." ' . .
A lot of- seeds stored at Santa Clara
was attached to-day in an action com
menced by H. Cheeseman against C. P.
Braslan for $1050 [ alleged to be due for
services and money advanced. Cheese
man was employed as salesman by the
Braslan Company. Braslan denounces
the action as spite work because of his
part in Union Bank affairs, and sav_

BO quickly, and the body was relaxing
almost before the .witnesses were con- j
scious that the execution had occurred. ;
Only the woman's mouth was visible I
and it changed merely in the drawing j
down of the lips and a little darkening
of the skin. Mrs. Place murmured as
she was seated in the chair, "God help I
me; God have mercy." .-., â¢ !
There was no sound after that, not!
even a moan. The visible effect of the
shock was less than had ever been ob
served In the death house before. \
There was not the slightest distortion '
of the features; the eyes were covered !
and when the straps were removed they !
were still closed. On the second- shock
the body straightened out again and a i
little foam oozed from her lips. When
the current was shut off the body re
. posed naturally in the chair.
Dr. Irvine called upon the woman
physician to make an examination, j
which she did by merely opening, the
.waist and placing her stethoscope be
tween the folds of the dress over the
heart. She performed her work quickly
and then the other physicians present
were asked to complete the examina
tion. Dr. Irvine gave it as his opinion
that death had been instantaneous.
The body was allowed to remain in |
the chair until all the witnesses had re- I
tired, when it was taken to the autopsy j
room and a post-mortem examination j
held. No one was present but the j
operating surgeons and their - report
was sealed and will be filed in Kings j
County, together with the other docu
ments . relating to the woman's death. !
The autopsy was a rapid one, and al- j
though no information was made pub- j
lie, the indications are that the or- '
gans were found in a healthy condition. j
The insanity plea entered in behalf !
of Mrs. Place had never impressed fa- j
vorably those who knew the woman '
best. Her spiritual adviser, Rev. Dr. j
Cole, was one of those .who never for j
a moment thought Mrs. Place was any
thing but a sane woman, and this was !
the opinion also of Dr. Irvine and
finally of the commission appointed to
inquire into the condition of Mrs. Place
â Drs. Dana and Polk.
The body. was taken to the Sing Sing
station, where it was shipped to East
Millstone, N. J. Dr. Cole was asked to
officiate at the funeral, but he felt that
he could not stand the . strain. He
promised to be present, although he
could not conduct the public service.

MANIAC LASSOED TO
PREVENT HIS DEATH
SAN RAFAEL, March 20.â The eastern part of town was thrown into
excitement this evening by the actions of a crazy, man who. bereft of
clothing, rushed about the hills, yelling at the top of his voice. A coach
man of William Babcock telephoned for Sheriff Taylor, who repaired to
the scene with Constables Lewis Hughes and W. J. Treanor, Express
man George Agnew and a number of citizens.
They found the man hanging from a small ledge jutting from the
side of a cliff*; nearly sixty feet from the ground. He was foaming at the
mouth and savagely biting at the rocks, and paid no attention to calls
from the officers. Taylor and Agnew climbed the hill and appeared on a
rock about twenty feet above the maniac, from where a lasso was thrown
over him. He was hauled up. and after a hard struggle bound hand and
foot, then lowered to the ground with a rope. -
The man .was carried to the County Jail and there had to be placed in
a straitjacket on account of his violent attempts to scratch and bite the
officers. He was identified by a number of laborers as Joseph Azveda, a
laborer employed on the San Pedro dairy farm. He will be examined and
probably Consigned to an Institution for the insane to-morrow. How the
lunatic scaled the cliff is a mystery to the officers.
and estimating that each dwelling con
tained five inhabitants, I found that
11,000,000 people had their ' homes in
this great city.
"This city is spread over three coun
ties, namely, Dosha, Drew and Ashley,
in the State. of Arkansas, and was the
grand metropolis of that prehistoric
race called mound-builders. These peo
ple numbered countless millions, and
the Yazoo Valley of the Mississippi was
their fields. The entire delta of the
Yazoo was in a high state of cultiva
tion. Every acre was utilized for agri
cultural purposes, and ' was the chief
source of revenue for the busy little ex
tinct dwellers. Thousands of canals
were dug and used by them for irri
gation and navigation, and countless
pottery factories show that they manu
factured superior' articles of earthen
ware for domestic purposes. Pots,
cups, plates and baskets in sundry and
various patterns yet exist, some in
beautiful colors of red, white and black
enamel, with ngures of man. bird or
beast raised or cut in intaglio upon
them. v :
"Many acres are covered six. feet
deep with the bones of those unknown
people. Their teeth, yet sound and
perfect, can be picked up by the hatful
at this distant day. They were a small
race and their anatomy Is precisely the
same as that of the Chinese in every
particular. They came to this country
from the overcrowded regions of China.
I have, traced their footsteps from the
shores of Kamchatka and Siberia,
across the Aleutian Islands down the
Western shores of America, across the
continent to the valley of the Missis
sippi and many of Its tributaries to the
northern confines of -Mexico. There
they cease. No trace could I find in
South America. Coming back to the
Yazoo, Miss., delta, we find that 90 per
cent of all the streams or bayous that
flow through It were dug by these peo
ple, and all the gateways point to the
great metropolis beyond the Mississippi
in Arkansas."

THAT RUNS TO CABANAS
HAVANA, March 20.â Captain T. _..
Huston of the Volunteer Engineers was
questioned to.-day by 'a correspondent of
the Associated Press on the subject of the
story printed by a. local . newspaper at
Cincinnati, Ohio, saying that the location
of the keyboard by which the United
States battle-ship Maine was blown up In
Havana harbor on February 15, 1898. had
been found by him In a gunroom of the
Fonseca prison while engaged in cleaning
out the fortifications. The captain said
the use of his name in this connection
was not authorized. He showed the cor
respondent a cable with several wires
running into the harbor from Fonseca
prison opposite Cabanas fortress. One
wire was connected with a disused tele
graph Instrument in a neighboring Gov
ernment building. Though the cab * _,
not been investigated by the United
States engineers, the supposition is that
it- runs Ito Cabanas, across t the harbor,
and has been used *- or .telegraph ing.
There is a remote chance that .the wires
In the cable were connected with mines
or torpedoes, but there is no indication
that it had anything to do with the blow
ing up of. the Maine. The end of the cable
sticking out of Fonseca prison a has been
seen by tourists for weeks past. ..Man>
soldiers have also seen the cable and
many have expressed the belief . that It
was used to blow up the Maine.

KIDNAP CAPTAIN
WALLACE'S CHILD
Crime of Sailors of the
Sea King.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 20.âDe
serting sailors from the bark Sea King,
now loading lumber at the Chemainus
mills near here for Sydney, N. S. W.,
for which port she will sail on Wednes
day, have wreaked a fiendish revenge
for alleged wrongs upon Captain John
Wallace, master of that vessel. Four
deserters from the lumber ship are said
to have stolen his five-year-old son.
It was at first thought the boy had
fallen from . the gangplank which ran
between the ships between which his
father's vessel' was moored, but from
evidence discovered this afternoon the
boy was kidnaped. While the remain
ing sailors were dragging the bottom
of the bay members of a party that had
been searching the wilderness in the
vicinity of the lumbering towns re
turned and reported that the child had
been seen late on Saturday afternoon in
company with three of the sailors who
had deserted. The quartet, who are
thought to. have taken this terrible re
venge on the shipmaster, left the ship
early last week, vowing when they did
so, according to their messmates, that
they would "make it hot for the cap
tain." :â ' p---:a
The crew shipped at San Francisco.
The trouble was caused by the refusal
of the captain to send them to. the hos
pital ashore when they were feigning
illness. The four men lay in their
bunks for weeks, refusing to turn to
and complaining of sickness, and when
Chemainus was reached they asked to
be sent to the Marine Hospital, their
plan being, now that they had secured
their advance, to get away from the
ship. Captain Wallace called a doctor,
who pronounced them in good health,
and the captain then made them join
the rest of the crew at work.
â¢ Seeing that the captain was deter
mined to keep them aboard they left
under cover of night, with threats of
vengeance, which it seems they have
carried out by kidnaping the captain's
son. v ':./ --'-â¢- ? -'".'-. : v

ACCUSES HIS DEAD
WIFE OF FRAUD
William Brattan Baker of San Jose
Sues His Sisters "to Recover
Property.
SAN JOSE. March William Brattan
Baker of this city to-day filed a sensa
tional suit in the Superior Court, in which
he accuses his deceased wife, Emily
Maria Baker, and his three sistersâMa
tilda, Emily and Annie Bakerâ with de
frauding him of $23,500 worth of stock in
the W. B. Baker Company. . Baker's
father died some years ago, leaving a
valuable estate. This was afterward in
corporated into the' Baker Company, with
a capital stock of $50,000. Baker and his
wife each received 930 shares, valued at
$23,500, and the rest was divided among
his sisters.
? The complaint alleges that as soon as
he received his certificate of stock he,
unknown to his wife, assigned it to her
In case of his death, but kept the matter
a secret and the certificate in his posses
sion. Shortly after his wife ' either found
or. stole it and had the stock secretly
transferred to his three sisters. By this
means he was ousted from the company
and deprived of his share of the property.
He asks the court to set the transfer of
stock aside, on the ground that he was
fraudulently deprived of It, and return it
to his possession. â¢

CANADIAN LAND
GRABS IN ALASKA
Governor Brady Gives
the Facts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON; March 20.â Some im
portant statements concerning the Alas
kan boundary situation are given in of
ficial correspondence now on file in tfie
State and Interior departments -which
have never been made public. Governor
Brady of Alaska, as long ago as the lat
ter part of February, called attention to
the extremely threatening condition of
affairs. On February 21 Governor Brady,
who was here, had a conference with Sec
retary Bliss, who was then just leaving
the Cabinet, and Secretary Hay, in which
he urged that the aggressive acts of the
Canadians be promptly met. .. He submit
ted a formal note of warning of the pend
ing trouble and the possibility of blood
shed. The note was considered at the
next Cabinet meeting.
On February 23, the records Show, the
Governor submitted a formal communi
cation to the Secretary of the Interior, in
which he speaks of the bitter feeling
along the line that made the presence of
.troops, in his opinion, imperative, and,
among' other thing's said:
The Canadians, from our way of looking at
matters, have constantly shown a spirit of
aggressiveness, so far as tne boundary line is
concerned. This" is shown in three instances.
There is a point on the Stickeen River which
for years has been regarded as the boundary
line. Thousands of miners have passed up and
down the river; merchants have done Immense
business, and this was always recognized as
the boundary line. An American citizen is
operating a quartz ledge six miles below the
recognized boundary. The Canadian officials
have cone down six miles below him, thus
making a gap of twelve miles. They compel
him to pay " duties on his - Supplies which he
. carried in to operate this ledge.
Last year, in February,, an order went out
to the customs officials .of the mounted police
to remove from the recognized stations on the
boundary lines to. the summit of the passes.
Our peoplo had no notification of such inten
tion; but they made the move, and some of
our citizens were at that time in favor of go
ing up and compelling them to move back by
force, but when I was sounded upon It, of
course I peremptorily forbade any such action.
I took the trip to the summit of. Chilkoot Pass
and found the British- flag flying there and the
Canadian officials collecting duties from all
who bad their, goods piled up there on the
snow.
I asked the officer in charge by what au
thority he had moved from the lake to the
summit, and he replied by the command of his
superior officer.
Now our customs officials at Skaguay have
not recognized these lines -so far as sending
convoys over with British goods. The convoys
get compensation from the persons they con
voy so far as Log Cabin, the point from which
the British moved to the summit of the White
Pass.
Recently the news has reached us here that
two convoys were Imprisoned for two days for
undertaking to continue to convoy as far as
Log Cabin.
Late last autumn gold diggings were discov
ered on a creek called Porcupine Creek, which
is a tributary of tj-ie Chilkat River, which is
upon the third trail, viz., the Dalton or Chilkat
trail. " These discoveries are proving to be
very rich, and they are very. close to â  the
thirty-mile limit, which we also always have
regarded as the boundary line. The claims
have been worked during the winter and people
are satisfied of their richness ami many men
have gone in with stocks of goods and pro
pose to start in business with the prospect of
a lively mining business. This Immigration
has been extensive from the fact that a few
weeks ago the Parliament of British Columbia
passed an alien act, which will throw part of
the intended immigration into the Atlln coun
try into the Porcupine district Instead. The
same aggressiveness which has been shown
upon the Stickeen and upon the passes would
impel the Canadians to move down and claim
this country as belonging to them.
I think I know the temper of our people and
feel sure In saying that if such a step be at
tempted on the part of the Canadians a con
flict will â  ensue. This danger Is so imminent
that I deem it wise that our troops in Alaska
be ordered to take possession on these lines
and maintain our sovereignty over the soli
which we claim. I see no other step for us to
take if we want to avoid a conflict with Great
Britain. I regard the â¢ Porcupine district
especially as the point of danger. ->>---
Secretary Hay, on February 23, wrote
to the Interior Department a letter in
which he adverts to the boundary nego
tiations. Among other things he said:
In the whole stretch of the coast boundary
line between Prince of Wales Island And
Mount St. Ellas there are but two localities In
which a boundary has been provisionally estab
lished pending the eventual determination of
> the entire question of the frontierâ In
"Stickeen River and at the passes north of
Dyea and Skagruay. â >/ \ Â»
Continuing. Secretary Hay said:
The location of the so-called Panhandle
boundary line between Alaska and the British
Northwest Territory is now under negotlatipnfi,
without agreement so far. ' Until the two
governments shall reach an accord as to the
definitive - boundary It would appear that the
point provisionally, located .on the Stickeen
River should be respected by both governments
as a modus Vivendi without prejudice to the
final fixation of the line. The very full report
of the Canadian engineer. Joseph Hunter,
should, it Js thought, > suffice to determine
whether there has since been such encroach
ment upon the Jurisdiction of the United States
as is alleged In Governor Brady's letter.
Secretary Hay concludes by suggesting
that unless it should distinctly appear
that the provisional- understanding of
January and February, 1878, has been dis
regarded by the British agents In the
Stickeen Valley, this Government should
not make complaiint or inquiry of the
not make complaint or Inquiry of the
statements. .

' LOS ANGELES, March 20.-Knob Hill

that has stood in the way of trespassers
in that aristocratic neighborhood is
amended. This afternoon the report ol
the Fire and Water Committee was sub
mitted to the Council and adopted the
only dissenting votes being those of Pres
idem Silver and Councilmen Toll and V.t
ter. This report recommended^ the amend
ment of the ordinance, which prohibited
on well" drilling within 1600 feet of West
lake and Sunset parks. "-.,_â â¢ -* _
The amendment . recommended and
adopted by a 6 to 3 vote was that Inst'
of the former comprehensive bounds a
new line of demarkation be adopted. It
happens that the new line is exactly what
the oil men and the Southern Pacific haw
wanted. It will leave outside the inter
dicted district the lots â¢ that have , been
leased by the Southern Pacificâ that i.-,
the Los Angeles Railway Company-for
the purpose of oil development.
The opposing factions were present in
full force in the lobby of the Council. The
oil men were there to flank the. petition oi
a thousand business men asking for â¢â .
amended ordinance. The Westlake Pa:/
district citizens were there to lend sup
port to their protest against any change
in the protective measure. The petition
and protest were read and laid away and

CAUSE OF SICKNESS
AMONG SOLDIERS
Much Refrigerated Meat Was
Also Condemned, Say Wit
nesses Before the Court.
. CHICAGO, March 20.â principal
â¢witness on the list to appear before the
army court of Inquiry to-day. Dr. Nich
olas Perm, was unable to be in the city.
w hereupon the court took a recess at
noon until 6 o'clock to-morrow evening,
when Dr. Senn will be heard. During
Its short session to-day the court re
ceived the evidence of four witnesses
who had been called upon request of
Major Lee. the representative of Gen
eral Miles. According to their testi
mony the canned beef was always un
palatable and distasteful, and in their
judgment it was a contributary cause
of sickness among the soldiers and un
fit for an army ration. Critical refer
ence to the refrigerated beef was also
made by the witnesses.
It seems probable that the court will
be able to terminate its Chicago work
in time to leave Wednesday evening for
New York.
The first witness examined was Colonel
J. D. J. Foster of the Fifth Illinois In
fantry- He testified that at Ponce he
drew refrigerator beef once. When the
meat reached camp it was pronounced
bad, and a board of inquiry condemned it
and It was burled. He did not try it
again. The regiment was about six miles
from the port.
Captain Edward J. Bemick of the First
Illinois testified that some of the canned
roast beef he saw was spoiled and was
thrown overboard on the voyage to Cuba.
After the surrender of Santiago refrig
erator beef was issued. The regiment was
Ã¼bout three miles from port. One lot was
buried as soon as unloaded on this and on
one or two other occasions. He thought
the condition of the meat was due to fail
ure to receive it promptly. About 25 per
cent received had to be buried and about
5 per cent of the rest had to be cut off and
thrown away. Some of the men .thought
they discovered a peculiar odor, but there
were no suspicions that the meat had
been chemically treated. On the voyage
home canned roast beef was issued," but
the men would not touch it.
"One day at Santiago," witness said.
I went into a restaurant and met a
rentleman in citizen's clothes, who made
himself .known to me as Swift's repre
sentative. He said he was in trouble; he
. had just got a cargo of beef in and thÂ«
refrigerator plant had stopped. He said
he was going to General Shafter to get

PERRY BELMONT'S
REPLY TO BRYAN
- NEW TORK, March Perry Bel
mont to-night gave out a reply to. a
letter received during the day from
Colonel W. J. Bryan,. in which he says
â  "that before answering the unwarranted
.letter he had instituted a suit against
a New York newspaper on account of
en alleged libel, in which he was char
acterized as "a higher priced man than
3 the floater, who sells his vote for 52 on
election day," and continues:
Tour purpose to be equally defamatory
that beef accepted. I told him I thought
poor beef came to our camp invariably,
but he said it was not poor beef, simply
discolored on the outside, and by cutting
away the discolored part the insiae would
be found perfectly good. I was in Gen
eral Wood's headquarters an hour .ater
and saw him there waiting for an inter
view with General Shatter. I did not
learn whether he succeeded In getting
that beef accepted or not, but I under
stood from outside parties that they
threw overboard several tons of it and
accepted the balance." _â¢__.Â«- .
Major Lee asked: "What effect. if am ,
did the canned roast beef have upon the
health of the men?" _,_-,-. n f
"The beef nauseated a great many of
the men; I am satisfied that it caused
diarrhea also." ,
"Was there any suggestion that it was
best to discontinue the use of hat _ meat.
"No sir: we made the best of it.
"You regard this canned roast beef as
wholesome or unwholesome as an army
ration?"
â¢'Unwholesome. , _Â«-_
Dr. William G. Wlllard. surgeon major
of the First Illinois Volunteers, testified
that in Cuba the health of his command >
was good up to July 22. Then th- sick
call began to increase very rapidly and
by the Â°*>th or 29th it was as high as 300
a day In his judgment this sickness
was due to a combination of circum
stances of which the condition of canned
roast beef was one. He had no occasion
to believe that any of the beef had been
treated with chemicals. Canned roast
beef so-called, was never a lit ration, in
his opinion, and It was especially unlit j
for men in the condition of the troops |
coming back from Cuba.
Replying to a question from Major Lee,
Dr. Willard said: "From what I have |
heard of its preparation and from its ap
pearance I should say it was boiled beef.
I had one case of scurvy- a man who had
been eating hardtack, sow belly and
canned roast beef regularly for thirty-:
three days. He was a member of the Sev- â¢
enth Infantry."
Oliver A. Gibson, quartermaster and
acting commissary of the First Illinois
Volunteers, corroborated the testimony of j
Dr. Willard. As a ration for a soldier
Gibson considered the canned beef in- j
ferior and would place the meat in the â 
third grade. The labels he saw were Ar
mour & Co.. bby, McNeill & Libby, and
a Kansas City firm whose name he did
not recollect. He also saw the Prairie
State Packing Company's brand, which,
in his opinion, was the worst of all and
should be placed in a grade lower than j
the others.
A number of witnesses who had been
summoned were on hand at 2 o'clock, but
none were examined, the court holding
no session in the afternoon.

words forbids the plea that in your letter
you misused them through ignorance.

erence to opinions upon public questions

The Democratic Club of New York has

CHAMBERLAIN SPEAKS
OF TRANSVAAL GRIEVANCES
LONDON, March 20.â During the course
of the discussion of the vote on account
in the House of Commons to-day the Sec
' retary of State for the Colonies, Joseph
: Chamberlain, replied to various colonial
'. questions raised.
Turning to the Transvaal, Chamberlain
' said that not one of President Kruger's
promises to remedy grievances had been
fulfilled.
Chamberlain asserted that if President
: Kruger would give the Johannesburgers a
real municipality, with control of their
own educational system and civil politics,
: as he could do without the slightest de
rogation to the interests and dignity of
i the Transvaal, he would remove nine out
! of ten Uitlanders' grievances.
Great Britain. Chamberlain then
I pointed out, could only intervene in the
i event' of a breach of the London conven
tion, or If the comity of nations was not
observed. As the paramount power in
: South Africa, Great Britain could make
: friendly suggestions, but he (Chamber
[ lain) did not believe for a moment that
' they would be successful now and there
; fore It would be undignified to make
: them.
Chamberlain concluded with saying:
"As long as the present conditions con
tinue they constitute a real danger. We
are watching the' situation most care
fully: but thus far there has been noth
ing to justify an ultimatum and. failing
compliance, war, which seems to have
: been suggested by a previous speaker."

PRESIDENT RESTS
ON JEKYLL ISLAND
BRUNSWICK, Ga., March 20.âPresi
'< dent McKinley rests to-night on Jekyll
Island, the beautiful winter club home of
; a number of Eastern millionaires, on St.
Simons Sound, ten miles up the coast from
Brunswick. With him are Mrs. McKin
ley, Vice President and Mrs. Hobart and
: Senator Hanna. They are the guests of
ex-Secretary of the Interior Cornelius N.
Bliss, whom the President promised to
visit last year. In another cottage is
Speaker Thomas B. Reed. All persons in
any way concerned in their presence at
Jekyll assert positively and unreservedly
that the visit of the two rival political
leaders at the same time is a mere coin
cidence. Whether any Improvement of
' their strained personal or political rela
[ tions will be one of the accidents of their
inevitable meeting on the island no one
will predict. The Speaker probably will
j leave Jekyll to-morrow afternoon or
Wednesday, and the Presidential party
\ on Wednesday forenoon.
DROWNED NEAR SUISUN.
SUISUN, March' 20.â Glullo Braghetta,
he lessee of Joyce Island, was drowned
on Thursday while crossing to the main
land to visit his wife and children at Fair
field. It was thought at the island that
he was still visiting at Fairfield, while at
the latter place it was believed his coming
'had been delayed by the storm; conse
quently his relatives had no intimation of
the tragedy until this afternoon, when his
nephew, Victor Tolo, came to Suisun and
learned that Braghetta had not been seen
here. Search was instituted and Brag
hetta's capsized boat was found at Long
Beach. It is probable that he was caught
by the gale while crossing on Thursday
and the craft capsized. Search for the
body has been unavailing.
i Braghetta was one of the most promi
nent Swiss residents of this vicinity. He
was 53 years of age. For the past five
years he had - conducted a stock raising
business on Joyce Island, in partnership
with ex-Sheriff B. F. Rush, who owns the
island. The deceased was a member of
the Odd Fellow and Knights of Pythias
lodges. ;â¢â .-;._

NO DANGER NOW
OF CROP FAILURE
Continued Rainfall in
California.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS. March 20.â The whole of
Monterey County was treated to another !
rain last night and to-day, while this par
ticular section received a tremendous
downpour. In tbfcVty and vicinity it
has rained almosS-ricessantly for the past
twenty-four hours, and from all indica
tions the storm is not yet over. The ba
rometer is very low, the wind Is blow
ing from the southeast and there is
every indication of several days' rain. The
Salinas River, which was swollen con- ;
siderably by the last storm, has been so
augmented by the present downpour that
in some places "it is wider than it has
been In years. The many irrigation en- j
gines and pumps that are situated near j
the river banks are in danger of being
washed away. The rainfall for this vi
cinity during the storm is .81 of an inch
and for the month over 2 inches. Re
ports come from the south, and especially
that portion of the county where the
farmers have been drought-stricken for
several years, that not only are they
saved from destitution and possible star
vation, but that with the last storm and
the present rain they will be able to
stock up their larders. Other sections
will get a half-crop of grain, while in the
section between Gonzales and this city a
two-thirds grain crop is assured. Mon
terey's greatest output this year, how
ever, will be sugar-beets. The Spreckels
Sugar Company alone has about TWO acres
of land near this city ready to plant to ,
beets. Many other ranchers will put in
beets who up to a week ago did not ex- ;
pect to raise any. The Spreckels com
pany's pumps are running night and day
irrigating their ranches No. 1 and No. 2.
At King City, where they have recently |
put on a larger force of men, they will
plant about 5000 acres to beets. At the j
present outlook the new factory will have
to run' this season.
MONTEREY, March 20.â The splendid .
rain that began here at daylight yester
day morning has completed the good .
work begun by the storm of last week.
Already an inch and a quarter of rain
has fallen and to all appearances the j
storm is not over. It is believed fully
2.5 Inches will be the precipitation of the
present storm. There will be a good crop
of apples and apricots and a fairly good j
one of peaches and pears. The rain means
thousands of dollars to this section, as it
obviates the necessity of expensive Irri- |
gation plants. Small fruit and vegeta
bles also are gseatly benefited by the ,
storm. News comes from the southern
coast section of the county where cattle
are raised that many of the larger ;
ranch owners who lost so heavily by cat
tle dying from want of grass last year j
are restocking their ranges. The feed for
stock in that section is already better ;
than for years past, and the present rain
assures an abundance for the entire year
throughout that section.
KING CITY, March 20.â rain
which fell here on the 15th and 16th Inst, '
came just, in time to save the crops. The
grass is growing fast, and there is no
reason to fear a scarcity of feed for stock
this season. Many of the stockraisers had
made "arrangements to move their herds, :
but the timely rainfall precludes the ne
cessity of going to this expense. In many
places in this valley the rainfall for the ,
last storm exceeded an inch. The Salinas
River is booming, and the threatened lack
of water for irrigation purposes Is be- !
lieved to be a thing of the past. There
will be enough water to irrigate the en
tire Spreckels beet sugar ranch. It has
been raining here since yesterday, and
another good rainfall is looked for. Should
it fall a heavy crop of grain and feed
would be doubly assured in this valley.
VENTURA, March 20.â Another liberal
installment of moisture fell last night,
reaching all parts of the county. Ven
tura had half an inch, Oxnard, Hueneme
and Simi three-quarters and Santa Ana
and the Ojai Valley about an inch. An
other storm is approaching. The farmers
are in a cheerful mood. The prospects j
are encouraging for the best bean crop I
In vf*__.rs
MODESTO, March 20.â This section has
been visited by another welcome rain.
For the past twenty-four hours the fall
has been 1.20; total for the storm 2.48
inches and for the season 7.09. The pros
pect could not be more satisfactory than
at present. The wind is still from the
rainy quarter and the sky cloudy.
WOODLAND. March 20.â weather
was stormy Sunday afternoon and at
times the precipitation was quite heavy.
The rainfall at 8 o'clock this morning was
62 of an inch, making 12.18 inches tor the
Storm This seems to make reasonably !
certain good crops all over Yolo County.
SANTA CRUZ. March 20.â Another good
rain * has visited every section of this
county. It commenced yesterday and the
downpour through the night was heavy.
There have been frequent showers to-day.
The rain is of much benefit. |
GOVERNOR STONE
MAY APPOINT QUAY
The Pennsylvania Statesmar) to
MaÃe a 9bt for a Seat in
the Senate.
n> Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel, Washington, March 20.
0 It is reported here that Governor Stone has decided to appoint Quay
â¢5 as United States Senator in default of an election by the Pennsylvania
% Legislature, and that Quay will put in his certificate and make a de
Â£> termlned fight for his seat. He expects to receive a majority of the
Â»* votes of the Republicans in the Senate, and relies upon several Demo
Â® cratic votes to reverse the precedent heretofore established in that body.
Â§ If Quay is seated it is said that other Governors will also appoint Sen-
M ators. Among the best informed politicians in Washington It is the 1m-
S pression that there are still too many Senators in that body who are
ft sticklers for Senatorial precedents and their honored customs to reverse
â¢* the action taken by the Senate in the Washington, Montana, Wyom
-3 ing and Oregon cases. Many Senators who voted against seating ap
Â§ pointees from, these four States are yet members of the Senate and can
ft not consequently change their attitude on this question.
CHIRRED BODIES
ARE REMOVED
Remains of Two Wind
sor Victims Recovered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 20.â A large
force of men worked in the ruins of the
Windsor Hotel to-night. Part of the
rear walls and chimney on the Forty
seventh-street side was still standing
at a late hour. Smoke was issuing from
the chimney, which extends to the base
ment, showing that fire still smolders
in that part of the ruins. The workmen
excavated slowly and with great care.
The debris was thrown from the space
occupied by the hotel to the sidewalk.
Crowds pressed as close to the ruins as
they were allowed by the police.
At midnight 300 laborers who had
been digging in the ruins were relieved
by another gang of 300. No other body
has' been found since 9 o'clock in the
morning, when the workmen came
across the remains of two charred
bodies.
The men worked all day on. three
sides of the old hotel, Fifth avenue.
Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh streets.
From the three sides on which the
workmen are engaged the ruins had at
midnight been gone over for about
twenty-five feet from the building line.
The first body taken out to-day was
from the Forty-sixth-street side; the
second from the Fifth-avenue side?
close by what had been the main en
trance. They were merely fragments of
bodies. Neither has feet nor arms.
These fragments were taken to the
Morgue, where they were ticketed as
bodies "1" and '_*' and placed in the
section especially set aside for the fire
victims. These two bring the total
number of bodies so far recovered up
to twelve. Besides these there are at
least six persons who were seen to
jump from the roof and windows while
the hotel was burning, and of whose
bodies no trace has yet been found.
From time to time to-day articles of
more or less value were*, found and
turned over to the police. They in
cluded jewelry, watches, clocks, canes,
articles of clothing, letters, keys,
photographs,* field and opera glasses,
silverware and toilet articles. A neck
lace was found on the Forty-sixth
street side near where the baths were.
It was set with diamonds and opals
and estimated to be worth about $10,
--000. M&m
According to the lists of missing
property prepared by the police it be
longed to Mrs. James R. Stokes, who Is
missing. One of Thomas P. Ochiltree's
trunks was found, the contents quite
uninjured.
Several of the persons hitherto re
ported as missing were found to be safe
to-day. The present list of missing
numbers forty-four.' This, however,
takes into account but few of the 200
servants of the house. Although at
night the ruins are perfectly lit by elec
tricity and oil lamps, the men work
under disadvantage as compared with
the day men, and proceed more slowly.
At midnight the contractors thought
that many bodies would be discovered
by to-morrow, by which time a suffi
cient space will have been cleared away
to allow a larger number of men to
work to advantage.
CHINA NOW IN A
MORE PLIANT MOOD
ROME, March Admiral Canavero,
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, to
day returned the visit of the Chinese Min
ister. Sir Chih Chen, with whom he had
a prolonged interview yesterday, presum
ably regarding the Italian demand for a
concession at San Mun Bay. Sir Chih
Chen will be received by King Humbert
to-morrow.
According to the Trlbuna. the Chinese I
Minister expressed to Admiral Canavero
the apologies of the Tsung li Yamen for i
returning the note of Signor Martino, j
then Italy's Minister at Peking, embody- |
ing the Italian Government's request, and |
said if another note was presented it
would be examined with the "greatest j
friendship toward Italy." Regarding this
the paper remarks:. "The presentation ,
of a note would show that the Minister !
has no further mission and that the mat- j
ter would be arranged between the Tsung j
li Yamen and the Italian Foreign Office."
Admiral Grenet has received a telegram
of congratulation from Emperor William j
upon his appointment to the command of {
the Italian squadron in Chinese waters.
FATAL RIOTS AT
LAREDO, TEXAS
Crisis Reached in the
Smallpox Epidemic.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LAREDO, Tex., March 20.â The crisis
in the disturbance here over the carry
ing out of the State Health Officer's
regulations in suppressing the small
pox epidemic seems to be reached.
When the work of removing the pa
tients was resumed this morning the
scenes of yesterday were repeated, and
Captain Rogers of the State Rangers
and four assistants attempted to dis
perse, the crowd, but were fired upon
and Captain Rogers received a bullet
in the. left shoulder. The Rangers re
turned the fire, killing Agipato Her
rera, an ex-policeman, who was leading
the rioters, and another Mexican, and
wounding a woman, a sister of Her
rera, who had fired at the officers from
the window of a house near by. Sev
eral other Mexicans were wounded, but
the number cannot be ascertained, as
they escaped in the crowd. Dozens of
people report seeing wounded men, but
how many saw the same ones is not
known. The shooting was followed by
a number of scattered shots In dif
ferent parts of that quarter of the city
populated largely by Mexicans, and
they were construed 'as prearranged
signals by the rioters for re-enforce
ments.
Dr. Blunt, according to arrangements
made, had notified Captain Ayers, in
command at Fort Mcintosh, tnat the
United States troops were needed, and
at 11:45 a. m. a detachment of the
Tenth Cavalry, mounted and fully
armed with 100 rounds of- ammunition
each, arrived at the market place. City
Marshal Joseph Bartholomew was
sworn in as an officer, and under his
direction the crowd was quickly dis
persed. The leader of the first crowd
encountered by the military under
took to talk instead of obeying orders
to clear out, and was promptly knocked
down with the butt ot a carbine and so
badly hurt that he died within a short
time after being carried away. His
followers took the hint and rapidly fled.
A Catling gun and an ambulance
corps accompanied the cavalry, and
affairs took on a decidly martial ap
pearance. All places of business were
closed, and the placing of the Catling
gun In a position to rake a street
would quickly clear that thoroughfare
from end to end. Platoons of troopers
circulated through the disturbed dis
trict and scattered or drove out the
crowds gathered on the cross streets,
most of them taking refuge under the
river bank but offering no resistance.
Mayor Chrlstin had requested Colonel
O'Horan, the commandant of the Mexi
ican military force in Nuevo Laredo, to
co-operate with the Laredo authorities
in preventing the crossing and recross
ing of the river by crowds in case of
trouble, and while several hundred
Mexicans driven out of the disturbed
district were refugeeing under the river
bank a strong detachment of Mexican
cavalry deployed on the south bank of
the Rio Grande. Those on this side
concluded they were coming across to
assist them against the colored United
States cavalry, and a mighty cheer
went up. Fortunately, however, they
discovered their mistake before doing
anything rash. The city being: quieted,
the work of the health officer was again
taken up, with a guard of cuvalry with
each wagon, under orders from Captain
Ayers that if anybody attacked in any
way the Mexican officers or themselves
to "shoot, and shoot to kill."
The work progressed during the rest
of the afternoon without further inter
ruption, and will continue under ihe
cavalry guard until completed. Thy
chances of serious trouble seem about
over, though there may be Isolated
cases of resistance to the health of

FIGHT OF STATE
OF OHIO AGAINST
THE OIL TRUST
Standard Attorney Demands the
Name of the Man Who Offered
Big Bribe to Attorney
General.
NEW YORK, March Upon the
arrival of the interested parties in the
Standard Oil Company hearing at the
Hoffman House it was decided to take
no testimony to-day. It was agreed to
have a hearing in the case of the State
of Ohio vs. the Buckeye Pipe Company,
a branch of the Standard Oil Company.
Messrs. Elliott and Kline, counsel for
the Standard Oil Company, sent a letter
to Attorney General Monnett of Ohio
to-day, demanding that he. make public
the name of the man who offered him
a bribe of $.00,000 to discontinue his
fight. -
With reference to the letter written
him by Elliott and Kline, Attorney Gen
eral Monnett said he would reply to it
after he had consulted, with the Su
preme Court of Ohio.
A hearing in the case- of the State of
Ohio against the Buckeye Pipe Line Com
pany was begun this afternoon in the of
fice of Commissioner C. Edgar Mills. The
hearing was held that the Attorney Gen
eral might take depositions in the pro
ceedings brought in Ohio to annul the
charter of the Buckeye company for vio
lation of the anti-trust laws of Ohio. The
claims of the prosecution are that the
Standard Oil Trust still exists and that
despite the law the Buckeye Pipe Line
Company is still a member of it. The
Buckeye Pipe Line Company was organ
ized for the transportation of crude oil.
Its headquarters are at Lima. Ohio, and
its capital stock is $10,000,000. H. H. Rog
ers is the president.
At the proceedings to-day M. F. Elliott
and Virgil P. Kline represented the com
pany. Attorney General Monnett ap
peared for the State of Ohio. W. L. Flagg
acted as his assistant.
As a preliminary Messrs. Elliott and
Kline agreed to admit a copy of the testi
mony given in October last by John D.
Rockefeller in the Standard Oil Company
case, provided the Ohio court should de
cide that such evidence was competent.
Counsel objected, however, holding that
such testimony was not competent.
George Rice was the first witness called.
Flagg asked him if he ever owned a certi
ficate of the Standard Oil Trust and he
answered yes.
The witness identified as his property
two certificates, one a certificate of the
Standard Oil Trust and the other a cer
tificate of assignment of legal title, both
original certificates.
"Have you ever owned a trust certifi
cate of the kind called a certificate of
equitable interest, which you handed into
the trust and for which you received a
certificate known as an assignment of le
gal title?" continued Flagg.
Rice said he could not reply unless
given an opportunity to explain, and
Flagg asked, "Did you ever hand in to
the trust a certificate for which you re
ceived stock of a constituent company?"
TRAGIC SEQUEL
TO GOOD NEWS
Suicide of a Farm Hand
Near Olema.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, March 20.â For over
a decade Francis Melanti eked . out a
miserable existence as a farm hand on
a ranch near Olema. Then came the
news that a large fortune had been left
him by the death of a relative in
France, and with the news came insan
ity, resulting in suicide.
Melanti, who was commonly known'
as "French Frank," lived in a little
cabin about eight miles from Olema.
and was very reticent about his oast
life. About all he ever told his com
panions was that some day he expect
ed to go back to France and live in
plenty for the rest of his life. A few
weeks ago he received a letter which
evidently contained news of a pleasant
nature, for he seemed very happy after
ward, and said he was going home,
where a large sum of money awaited
him. Shortly after the receipt of the
1. issive he was taken ill and confined
to his bed.
Frank Knott, a gamekeeper for the
Country Club,. visited the cabin yester
day and found Melanti lying dead on
the floor in a pool of 1 lood. In his
breast was a gaping wound and by the
side of the remains lay a rifle. The
position of the body and the weapon,
together with the *->owder burns on the
clothes, showed that Melanti had com
mitted suicide by placing the muzzle
of the gun against his breast and dis
charging it with his toe. Coroner Eden
was summoned and brought the re
mains to this city after an rnquest was
held. The verdict was death from a
gunshot wound self-inflicted.
It is believed that worry' over his
health, which prevented his leaving for
France after he had made preparations
t ogo, unbalanced the man's mind and
caused him to seek death.

Rice said "yes." and again asked to be
allowed to explain.
Flagg held him to a "yes" or "no" an
swer. Flagg asked an explanation of the
exchange of stock certificates and Rice
showed that at the dissolution of_the
trust he received in place of a historical
certificate of stock a certificate of as
signment of legal title which entitled him
to his proportion of the property owned
by the twenty different companies repre
sented In the trust. â
"The last certificate conveyed to me,
said Rice, "an equitable Interest in the
property owned by the trust; the second
conveyed to me the legal title. _
"To whom did you present the certifi
cates supposed to convey the legal title.
"I did not present It.* It was presented
by my agent ; McKemper, to the liquidat
ing trustees." you receive directly upon
â¢What did you receive directly upon
presentation of that certificate.
"I received corporate scrip in nineteen
different constituent corporations and a
paper acknowledging a fractional Interest
in the Anglo-American Oil Company of
London." _ ... . ' â
"Now, having stated so much, will you
state if the Buckeye Pipe Line Company
was a member of what is known as the
Standard Oil Trust?" asked Flagg.
"yes. it was."
"How do you know?'
"By its being represented in the corpor
ate scrip I received from the liquidating
trustees." .. .
In answers to questions witness said he
had owned this corporate scrip about
three years. He had never received any
dividends from any of it. None of the
companies in which he received fractional
shares upon surrender to the trust of the
trust certificate paid dividends on such
fractional shares. Besides this scrip wit
ness said he had six shares represented by
certificates of the Standard Oil trust.
A special dividend paid on the Standard
Oil trust certificates in the hands of the
liquidating trustees. Rice said, amounted
to 36 per cent for the last two years, or
17% per cent a year. The regular dividend
was 12 per cent a year, making a total
dividend -of 29 1 . per cent per year. Wit
ness said the fact that the three-sevenths
of the stock of the pipe line company still
remained as it did constituted the reason
for the existence of what is known as.
liquidating board of trustees. He under
stood that the other four-sevenths were
owned almost exclusively by the liquidat
ing trustees and the officers of the other
nineteen constituent companies. His re
fineries had been shut down for about
three years. He was still producing oil.
He thought the Buckeye Company did 9"Â»
per cent of the local pipeage in the State
of Ohio. He was not aware that other
companies had tried to obtain some of this
business. :"". â¢â¢'. >'â â

SCORES OF BILLS
THROWN OUT BY
GOVERNOR GAGE
His Excuse Is That They Failed to Reach
Him Before the Legislature
Adjourned.
SACRAMENTO, March There -is
promise that the labor of the Senate
and Assembly during the closing hours
of the Legislature will avail nothing.
The last batch of bills passed in both
houses did not reach the State printing
' Office' until early Sunday morning. Dur
ing the rush of work on these bills one
of the presses became disarranged and
two fonts of type were "pied." , This
occasioned such a delay that nearly two,
score of bills failed to reach the Gover
nor until after the Legislature had ad
journed sine die. The Governor has
made the positive statement that he
will not sign these bills. He gives as
his reason that it would be against
public policy to sign bills that had not
been duly reported back to the two
houses and the report entered into the
journal and approved.
If the Governor has in mind the call
ing of an extra session for the election
of a United States Senator he can con
ceal his motive by calling the session
for the passage of these bills, .which he
claims under the conditions he cannot
sign. . When the Legislature is in ses
sion for any purpose whatever and
there is a vacancy in the United States
Senatorship it may ballot for Senator,
even though this was not mentioned in
the call for the special session.
Some doubt has been expressed as to
whether Assembly bill 728, appropriat
ing $250,000 for the Pacific Coast Expo
sition, is included in the list of belated
bills. An attempt was made this even
ing to Interview Governor Gage regard
ing the exposition bill and an extra ses
sion. The Governor positively refused
to answer any questions or give out
any information. It is understood the
reason for the Governor's unwillingness
to talk to-night is that there are some
of these bills he intends to sign and
that others he will refuse to sign, on
the grounds heretofore stated. It is
evident that if he should sign one of
these bills it would be inconsistent to
refuse to sign others, and consequently
he does not care to have the public at
this time know the bills that are in
cluded in the list.
The following is the list of" belated
bills, claimed to have been given by the
Governor's office to-day to certain As
semblymen close to the administration.
It is believed to be correct, although
that is a matter concerning which the
Governor alone knows:
Assembly bill 606â Making an appro
priation for repairs to the Capitol build

Assembly bill 385â Regulating the mode

The foregoing list includes the ap
propriation for the San Francisco Ex
position. Other lists which it is claimed
came from the Governor's office do not
contain this bill and it is said this bill
was sent to the Governor at 11:40 Sun
day morning. Controller Colgan de
clares, however, the exposition bill is
among the number that did not reach
the Governor until after adjournment.
In past years it has been by no means
uncommon for bills to be sent to the
Governor after the Legislature had ad
journed. Particularly is this true of
Governor Markham. "He and other Gov
ernors did not hesitate to sign such
bills when it was evident their passage
was for the good of the State or the
locality they were intended to benefit.
State Printer Johnston was asked to
night if there was anything in the
story "which it is rumored a San Fran
cisco paper will publish to-morrow to
the effect that the holding back of the
bills was a part of a bold conspiracy to
cause the Legislature to hold over- after
11 o'clock Sunday so as to force further
balloting for Senator; also that two
"forms" of type were purposely "pied"
to cause the delay. Mr. Johnston said
that he received the big batch of bills
for final printing at 9:55 a. m., with in
structions to return them before 11
o'clock. This was an utter impossibil
ity, and all the printing offices in the
city could not have done it. It was 5
o'clock in the afternoon when the bills
were completed and returned to the of
ficers of the Legislature. On the day
before a "form" was "pied," but it was
matter for the history of bills and had
nothing whatever to do with the print
ing of the bills received the next day.
Mr. Johnston says any story of a con
spiracy of that sort is as ridiculous as
it is false.

San Mateo Supervisors Wrestling
With a Difficult Problem.
REDWOOD CITY, March 20.-The time
of the Board of Supervisors was taken ud
this afternoon with the report on the pro
posed new road between Woodside and
La Honda. There is at present but one
road between the county seat and the
entire coast side of this county, except
the road that leads from Half-moon Bay
by way of San Mateo and Belmont ThÂ«
present road, from Woodside to the sum
mit of the mountains, has a grade vary
ing from six to twelve feet, and from
the summit to La Honda from five to
seven feet. The new road will be on this
side of the mountain of a uniform grade
of four and* a half feet and on the other
side of three and a half feet to the hun
dred, and at its highest point will be 225
feet lower than the highest point in the
present one. It was shown that the nine
miles of new road will save from one to
one and a half hours In time over the
same distance of the old road.
Some of the largest property owners are
unwilling to grant rights of way. Among
them are E. D. Jones. E. F. Preston and
B. D. Weeks, the road running through
the land of the former for a distance of
five miles. Mr. Jones and Mr. Preston
refused to estimate the damage, on the
ground that the* road would cause irre
parable injury to their property.
Further testimony will be heard by the
board on April 3. -Â»

three entries. She was undoubtedly best,
but Spencer, who had the mount, took
exasperating liberties with her, only to
be led out a head by Marcus Daly's Mort
gage. The winner is a daughter of Mon
tana and . Lottery and was ridden to
every advantage by Thorpe. In fact, the
veteran was overzealous in his desire to
win. interfering with the favorite some
what in the last part. Spencer, however,
lodged no claim of foul with the stand.
Winyah ran third.
Why Rancivor was installed favorite for
the opening event is not known. She has
shown little In the past, and ran unplaced.
Sweet Cakes, the entry of. Garnet Fergu
son, got away in advance of the field, and
never headed finished over a length ahead
of Guatemoc at the wire. The winner was
10 to 1 in the betting.
Tossed in a mile selling race, to be sold
for a fourth of her real value, the second
event over a mile proved easy for
Espionage. A 11 to 10 favorite, she was
backed to a standstill by the Chicago dele
gation, and won hands down from Whale
back. Horton finished a very bad third.
Over a heavy track Eddie Jones is more
than a useful horse, and the brown horse
outclassed his field in the second mile
event. A 2 to 5 favorite, he won leisurely
from Castake.
Liberal scratching caused tho field In
the seven and a Jialf furlong recital to be
reduced to five. Dr. Sheppard had a dis
tinct call In the ring, and with Piggott
up subdued Prince Blazes and Tempo the
last part without great effort.
Frank McMahon, the astute young
southern turfman, sprang a mild surprise
in the final mile and a sixteenth run with
Pat Morrissey. The major portion of the j
crowd thought the route too far for the
gelding, but it proved only a gallop for
him. Carrying Thorpe and 109 pounds. Pat
made every telegraph polo an insulated '
one, beating Dr. Bernays out six lengths.
Torsida, the favorite, was unplaced.

HONEST SPORTSMEN
FAVOR THE NEW LAW
Ingleside's Gamblers Denounced by
Advocates of Sport.
DELAY IN THE POLICE COURT
Attempting to Fight the Operation of the Ordinance
With Absurd Technicalitiesâ Jury Trials in
Every Caseâ The Police Watching
PooIro)ms.
Ed Corrigan and his motley crew of
gamblers, who have ruined racing in this
city, have no defense for the evil of Ingle
side except the uncertain chance that the
prohibitory ordinance shall be declared
illegal.
When the flght to destroy the nest of
blacklegs at the track began legitimate
lovers of horse racing, as a high-class
sport, were fearful that the destruction of
the gamblers migMKtojure honest sport.
These sportsmen s|s'uo\v that the atro
cious game, as Corrisan and his fellows
have developed It, must be completely
eliminated before legitimate racing can
find again a place. These men realize
that the thieving tout has replaced the
breeder of good horses; that the "skate"
has replaced the stake horse; that an hon
est sport, with honest chances, has retro
graded into sure-thing gambling.
Legitimate sportsmen therefore, men
who are personally and deeply Interested
in honest, high-class horse racing, are
adding their praise to that of the press,
pulpit, merchants and artisans for the
suppression of the great vice of Ingle
side. The gamblers must stand, there
fore, alone In their struggle for immoral
ity against the law. The courts are now
the only refuge of the blacklegs.
The opinions of legitimate sportsmen
were .well set forth last Saturday in the
Breeder and Sportsman, the representa
tive newspaper of its class in the West.
This paper denounces the game of Ingle
side in unmeasured terms and takes the
position that honest horsemen should
welcome the death of a dangerous, im
moral game that has been driven out of
every other community. The Breeder has
nothing but words of praise and encour
agment for horse racing honestly con
ducted, but for a gambling game which
corrupts and blights the community there
are only words of condemnation. The
Breeder declares that honest horsemen
and honest sports have it now in their
power, since the beginning of the light
against Ingleside, to kill the great evil or
refuse to move until the debasing game
has been removed. These opinions from
such a source will carry great weight.
In the courts the gamblers are finding
very little encouragement. In the Police
Courts they are fighting for delay. They
asked yesterday that juries be drawn by
the Sheriff, but the request was denied.
They will receive a hearing to-day, and in
every instance demand jury trials. The
Superior Court will not act until Friday,
when the application for a writ of injunc
tion will be heard.
The way of the Ingleside transgressors
through the courts does not seem to lie
over the smoothest bitumen, but, on the
contrary, the road grows rougher as it
advances. There appears to be a point
in the matter of smashing laws in this
city when that business gets a setback,
and the point and the setback have ap
parently come along. When the racetrack
cases came up in the two Police Courts
at 10 o'clock yesterday morning the at
torney for the defendants began the to
be-expected sparring for delay. A jury
trial was requested, and the jurors must
be impaneled by the Sheriff instead of the
Chief of Police. The police officers had
lawlessly broken into the property of the
racing people and interfered with the very
proper, innocent and lawful amusement of
the persons engaged in selling pools, and
had marched to and fro upon that prop
erty intimidating the possible purchasers
of those pools. All this savage exercise
of a function clearly not within their
right, intimated Attorney Ach, for the
defendants, demonstrated an intense bias,
a fierce prejudice on the part of the Chief
of Police and his captains and officers.
Moreover, continued the lawyer, a police
officer is financially responsible for an
arrest that fails of convictionâ a remark
able revelation and one, if established by
-Judicial decision, that will intimidate and
officially paralyze every peace officer in
this city.
tb Mr Cl Ach continued that the arrests
were' made In the presence of Chief Lees
by police officers acting wholly on what
is called "police evidence."
The matter first came Into the field of
judicial vision in Judge Mogan's court,
attorney Ach, with his seventeen clients,
stood at the bar and asked for a Sheriff
impaneled jury. * The Judge took the
question under advisement till 11 o clock,
and the lawyer with his troop filed across
the corridor into the Police Court of Judge
Conlan. Here the same request, giving
the same reasons, was made. The pros
ecuting attorney stated in return that
such reasonâ bias and prejudice on the
part of the arresting officerâ be
given in every case of arrest in this city.
He then read section 230 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, which is as follows:
"When jurors are required in any of the
Justices' courts or in any Police or other
inferior court, they shall, upon the order
of the Justice or any one of the Justices
where there is more than one, or of the
Judge thereof, be summoned by the Sher
iff. Constable, Marshal or police officer of
the jurisdiction." -â â â  â â  : ,-'_'-__
Judge Conlan quickly denied the motion,
stating that he could see no reason why
a Police Court jury should not be impan
eled in the usual mannerâ that is, by a
police officer, and that no bias or preju

dice on the part of the arresting officer
had been shown. ...
The case of H. L. Jones, one of the de
fendants, was chosen for trial and the
matter was continued till this morning
by consent of the prosecution, when it
will be set for hearing.
Mr. Aon and his party then crossed
back Into Judge Mogan's courtroom. Like
his Judicial brother over the way Judge
Mogan denied the motion of the defense
for a Sheriff jury in short order. In the
latter court Attorney Ach asked Chief
Lees if he was biased against the race
track either personally or in his official
capacity. Lees denied that he had the
least prejudice against the defendants and
said the course he is pursuing is prompted
only by duty and not by personal Inter
est. He did not personally superintend
the selection of jurors, but turned the
work over to different police captains, so
that the panel would come from differ
ent localities. The only instruction he
ever gave for such selection was to get
good men.
The cases will come up this morning as
in the other Police Court.
The Supervisors are still- receiving
words of commendation from all classes
of reputable citizens and organizations,
as the following communication will
show:
SAN FRANCISCO. March 16. 1899.
To the Supervisors of the City and County of

action is deserving of the sincere gratitude of
all who are interested in the welfare of our
city and the safety of our homes. Again thank
ing you, I am, yours most respectfully,
_____ MAY KIMBALL,
Recording Secretary.
The police, under the direction of Chief
of Police Lees, are still most active and
vigilant in carrying out the provisions of
the new law. Patrolmen were stationed
yesterday on every street where there is
a poolroom, and a virtual blockade and

STAMPED WINE.
Barkeepers Must Affix the War
Stamp to Wine When They
/ -;'; Bottle. It. v]J;
; : By letter dated March 14, 1899, George
;W. : Wilson, Commissioner - of- - Internal
Revenue, notifies Collector John C. Lynch
cf the following important rulings:
1. If a customer buys from a wholesale
dealer a barrel of claret for lax use and the
dealer bottles It, he must stamp the bottles be
fore delivery. *
2. A customer buys a barrel of claret for' bar
use and the dealer delivers It to him. It is
a wine that cannot be drawn from the barrel
a bottle -at a time without stamping what la
left, and if bottled all at once it must be
securely corked. If he bottles this wine all at
one time, the bottles to be uncorked as occa
sion requires, and the wine sold over the bar
he must stamp the wine when bottled.
3. A customer buys a tank of wine for bar
use in order to obtain uniform wine and orders
it bottled by the dealer and has it sent to him
fifty or more bottles at a time, as' occasion
requires. The stamps must be affixed when the
wine is bottled.
4. A customer buys a tank of wine for bar
use. If he comes to the dealer's cellar and
bottles It himself, furnishing his own bottles,
he must stamp the wine as it is bottled.
The only case In which a battle filled from a
barrel Is not taxable Is where the bottle merely
serves the purpose of a decanter, being filled
from the barrel as occasion arises, the intent
to sell by the glass being confirmed by the
actual and constant use for that purpose.
In cases where the entire contents of a barrel
are transferred at one time into bottles, there
to be retained for some time, the allegation
that the wine Is ultimately to be sold by the
glass cannot be accepted, and the bottles ln
such cases must be stamped according to law.

Gadski, De Lussan, Ma and - Ceppi Sing Meyerbeer's
Bombastic Masterpiece.-'
THE crowd that attended the
opera last night will go on record
as the largest of the Ellis season.
The police will" never permit an-
other like it. Every seat in the
large auditorium was occupied, and the
management only knows how many
admission tickets were sold. The aisles
and margins downstairs and in the
dress circle were blocked solid. No at
tempt was made to preserve the thin
nest sort of a passageway in the aisles
and doorways. The women could not
promenade, and he whose business or
pleasure encouraged going out between
acts was lucky to escape wit- a whole
skin â say nothing about the coat. The
Grand Opera House was simply
stretched. There was very" audible dip-"
order in the gallery during the early
part of the evening, but fortunately
nothing of a panicky nature happened.
The opera was Meyerbeer's bombas
tic masterpiece. "The Huguenots," with
a superlative cast: Gadski, the Valen
tine; Melba, the Marguerite; De Lus
ean, the page; Ceppi, the Raoul, and
Boudouresque the Marcel, and all the
subsidiary parts in good hands. The
choruses were strong and telling; the
orchestra under SeppilH was in the pink
of form. It would be hard to imagine
a better performance. But better and
more attractive operas there are by the
dozen, and th.' enthusiasm of the night
was hardly in proportion to the size of
the crowd. The cast was the magnet.
The crowd came because the three big
stars, Melba, Gadski and De Lussan,
were to sing. And it was a memorable
experience to hear these voices in one
production. It was especially satisfy
ing to hear Melba and Gadski on thÂ«
same night. Their .voices and methods
are so wonderful and unalike that the
special accomplishment of each singer
seemed enhanced. But even with the
finest vocalization and acting there are
long dull moments in "The Hugue
nots." Unquestionably this is the most
shapely and inspired of all Meyerbeer's
operas, but it weighs a ton just the
same, .so much of the music is so prosy
and pompous. It does not rush you
on to the sequel as Wagner does, as
even Verdi does in his later works; it
is brilliant, intense, dramatic at times,
but there are great broad perfunctory
deserts to cross that are very dry. It is
only a great cast that can make any
thing of "The Huguenots,." and even
then the stuffiness and gloom are not
entirely gilded over.
Mr. Ellis' cast was certainly mag
nificent; and the production throughout
was admirable, from, the mise-en-scene
to the ballet, which, while' almost ludi
crously small (eight and a premiere),
was alertly up to its business. The
concerted pieces and the tremendous
choruses were given out with zeal and
sonority, the masses of people 'were
well Btagemannered, and the principal
singers gave distinguished perform
ances. â¢". ""->''- â .â '*.-'- - : â :'
' Gadski's Valentine was another stun
ning tribute to this artist's remarkable
power and Versatility. It was a tenta
tive, poetic personation, beautifully
sung from that great sweeping vece of
hers, and beautifully proportioned in
interpretation. â¢ Not a false heroic
marred it. It swelled consistently till
the approach to the final tragedy, when
it bcame strenuously, passionately
dramatic. Ceppi played up to Gadski
in the right mood. He is one robust
tenor who realizes the importance of
repression, and his climaxes were legiti
mate and stirring. Not the least of
Ceppi's- amiabilities is his ability to
throw off a broad, ringing top note
without employing any of those man
nerisms that make tenors out to be
something less than men. . -â ,',;" ,^

MOST BRILLIANT
NIGHT OF ALL
- milE glory and. glitter of the opening
I night of the opera were but pale, flat
night of the opera were but pale, flat
'â¢'â . I and Insignificant incidents as com-
X pared with the magnificence of last
\ night. All those who graced the first
â¢â¢venlng were there with the addition of
BY ASHTOIV STEVENS
a mighty fringe of gorgeous, perspiring
humanity, who paid admission. blocked
the aisles and stood fifty deep in the few
feet of "standing room."
The management inaugurated a new
system and sold ''admissions," and there
were enough of "stand-up" seats sold to
again fill every chair in the vast house.
In the gallery there was the mischief
to pay. The first three rows were by a
prudent few reserved at the rate of $2
per seat, but the regular habitue of the
top circle resented the â¢ "airs" of the
holders of numbered chairs and seated
themselves in "first come, first served"
fashion. A force of eighteen . policemen
vainly essayed -to assist ticket-holders to
the chairs their coupons called for, but
the will of the "unreserved" majority
prevailed, with the result that several
hundred dollars was returned to coupon
holders at the box-office.
The elect arrived earlier than usual and
forced their way in through a mob of ad
miring humanity that with delicious
franK passed upon the cut of a gown,
the set of a, coat, the arrangement of
jewels and even the personal beauty of
the representatives of the swell set. .
Mrs. Joseph Tobin. in dead white satin
and fleecy tulle, muffled from throat to
heels in a brocaded white opera coat, for
a moment rendered the mob speechless.
Then a pale-faced little girl in shirt waist
and sailor hat found . her breath and
gasped: "My Gawd, hut don't she look
awfully like" Tom rke's wife?" Lucky
Ton*: Fortunate Mrs. Tobin! Not every
one won the [miration of the crowd as
she Id. One little girl in pink was told
her face was "like a tinted wall," and the
pale young beau on whose arm. she so
proudly leaned was pointed out to the
â¢crowd f. : as "that guy that looks ready
made."
The new carriage system worked
superbly. and there were no annoying
delays. Long before the rise of the cur
tan the house was seated, and the opening
chorus found a vast auditorium ready to
appreciate and applaud. .'; Â-_
The gowns of the ladies were of gor
geous splendor, and the jewels worn
spOke much for the wealth and rare Rood
taste of those in the social â  !m. There
was considerable good-natured discussion
as to whom should be awarded the palm
for taste, elegance and beauty; but there
were so many favorites with stanch sup
porters that the contest of necessity was
declared off.
Miss Helen Hopkins was without doubt
the most stunning girl in the auditorium,
and Miss Ethel Kceney. with her saucy.
little black patches showed up brighly
beside her in the Hopkins box.
Mrs. Will Crocker was remarkably
handsome. in a plain blue rhousseline so
altogether dainty and sweet and sia-.ple
that It must represent an appalling sum.
The foyer Was not so alive as on other
occasions, the "standing room" blocking
the aisles and making â - â¢> and entrance
a matter of much serious consideration.
It is doubtless for this reason that Joe
McCarty. son of the famous "White
Hat" of the same name. never went near
his se.at during the evening* Up and
down the foyer the young man tramped,
now and then breathing deep and draw
ing his opera tile further over his nose
but never within earshot of the music. .
A pretty scene between acts was the
cafe. The ladies who braved the crowded
aisles assembled th'-re to discuss the mu
sic and the audience and the gowns. It
was a crowd of ladies bound for the re
freshment booth after the first act who
detected Ernes! Wlltsee as he came
strolling' in. his -manly form encased in a
plebeian "storm coat." Wiltsee tried haro.
to hide his shame and finally managed to
shove the 1 offending garment Into the safe
keeping of the. cloak room.
Judge Megan was also perceived pro
tected from the cold in a tan top coat,
bis official head ornamented by a black
derby. â¢ -
However, if now and then outer gar
ments were a bit "shy." the dress suit
was every time to the front, and one ob
serving "foycrist" with a mathematical
turn of mind said be noted only seven
soup stains on the assembled gorgeous
ness of all the beaux. *

BUSINESS MEN ATTEND
THE NOONDAY SERVICE
THE first of the noonday services held at the Chamber of Commerce by the
Brotherhood of St. Andrew yesterday -was marked by the large congrega
tion of prominent business men. Bishop Moreland of Sacramento delivered
a sermon, hymns were sung, prayers repeated and benediction pronounced,
all in the short period of thirty minutes, after which the congregation dispersed
and returned to daily toil. The object of the meetings is to give an opportunity
to men occupied all the week and disinclined to attend church on Sundays of
attending divine service without much inconvenience to themselves.
The Episcopal clergy was well represented at yesterday's gathering. Hymn
books were â¢distributed by the ushers and an organ provided. The spacious cham
bers, .ordinarily devoted to the- consideration and disposition of worldly matters,
donned a sacred apearance. which was pronounced by the profusion of white
lilies arid the open Bible on the rostrum. After the opening hymn, the recital
of the creed. Bishop Moreland spoke in part as follows:
"I am addressing a congregation of business men. In the spirit of business I
will confine my remarks. I implore every one of you who cherishes a secret sin
to tear it from your heart. The man who conducts his business on lines of theft
and deception is too despicable to be called a thief. The man who places fraud
ulent wares on the market, sand in his sugar or adulterations on his shelves
is bereft of the Spirit of God and should reach for the hour of repentance at
once. Going to church will not save him, neither will it give him a title to
eternal life. He must amend his ways and tread the paths of righteousness, even
though Iris profits be less. .
"A business man's name on'the wrapper that binds his wares should he an
absolute guarantee of their purity and of his honesty and integrity. That men
may come to the realization of this I come to preach to you to-day. Oh, men.
do not think that because God does not strike you dead he will not pass judg
ment upon you. Death Is not a judgment. It is simply an introducer to a life
of paradise.. The judgment of God often visits men in the hours of their life.
"-.enounce evil before it is too late. Come back here to-morrow with a reso
lution to sin no more. In support of this, you will have the assistance of divine
power â a divine hand that sever- all chain*." ' *
The meetings will continue through the week. Among the clergymen who will
deliver sermons are: Rev. Herbert Parrish. Rev. Edgar J. Lion. Rev. T. J.
Lacey, Ph.D., and Right Rev. V,*. F. Nichols, D.D., Bishop of California. John
W. Wood, general secretary of the- New York society, will preach on "Keep

AT THE THEATERS
De Koven's "Rcb Roy" Sue.
cessfnily Presented at
the Columbia.
A houseful of San Francisco's music
lovers greeted the Bostonians last night
in the Columbia Theater, where v.-; pro
duced for the first time in this city De
Koven's "Rob Roy." with Its kilted las
sies fair to look upon, its Scotch rebels
shouting for Prince Charlie, its sweet mel
odies and rol choruses, its scent of the
heather and Its pictured remembrances of
the days when the souls of true and loyal
men were sorely tried.
The company was favored with a house
of a quality that even Melba would not
scorn. Though the skies were darkened
with portents of rain the ladies came in
subdued epera toilets and their .escorts'
in evening dress.
"Rob Roy." despite some incongruous
patches of burlesque and Impossibility.
is a coherent work, in which the composer
of the score and the writer, of the book
seem to be at their best. Both parts that
go to make up the work have an out-of
door, breezy atmosphere. The kilted
Highlanders of Prince Charlie and the
red-coated soldiers of King George make
up the -personnel of the characters. The
music is De Kovenesque. There is a fine
effect of massed harmony in the choruses,
noticeably so in the military scenes., and
solos, duets and quintets are sprinkled
lavishly through the three acts of the
opera. "--- : , â 'Â¥â  '. â â â  : â .'â¢â  -
The first of the old favorites to receive
a hearty Californian greeting was Henry
Clay Barnabee, as Dugald MacWheeble,
Mayor of the town of Perth, and the old
time applause rang out to his song. "Take
Oft Your Hats to the Mayor and Make
Him a Low Salaam."

Jessie Barlett Davis, looking as pretty,
sinping as melodiously and acting as
earnestly as .ever, was encored and ap
plaud- at every appearance. She was
Prince Charlie's sweetheart and all the
Charlies in front of the footlights envied
him. She and Helen Bertram, as Rob
Roy's bride, had the most of the work of
the performance, and they did it well.
Of the men in the acting and singing,
William Broderick. the Cameron of Lo
chiel. took the lead. He looked the part
to the very life and acted and sang it
with an enthusiasm and virility that was
highly pleasing.
William Lavln was the Prince Charlie
and William H. McDonald the Mac-
Gregor. These and that of the Cameron
were the male serious roles and they were
performed faithfully and conscientiously.

"Rob Roy" will increase in popularity.
Aside from' its most excellent feature, the
music, it is finely set and costumed and
the groupings and tableaux are artistic.
It would be unjust to close without a
parting word for the chorus. It is not
built up of sticks, as choruses too often
.ire. but it is real flesh and blood, plump
and pretty, and knows how to move and
act and sing.
Alcazar.
"Nerves," a farce comedy, was present
ed at the Alcazar last night to a crowded
house, it is full of amusing complications
caused by the "weak nerves." of Mrs.
Captain Armltage and her mother. Mrs.
Angela Buxom Brittle, who keep their
husbands and ether people in perpetual
worry by their suspicions and innuendos.
The comedy parts are intrusted to Clar
ence Montain'e a's Hippolyte Caramel, a
French confectioner: and Marie Howe as
Mme. Zephyr Elaine, a fashionable mil
liner, and they were highly successful.
Frank Denithorne as a young dude with
a bad cold did a clever- piece of acting.
Ernest Hastings was Captain Armltage,
but he appeared to be out of .his element
and was forgetful of his lines. George Os

YOU ARE TAKING A TERRIBLE RISK.
To Prove for Yourself the Wonderful Merits of the Great
Kidney and Bladder Remedy, SWAMP-ROOT, Every
"Call" Reader May Have a Sample Bottle Sent Abso-
lutely Free by Mail.
Have you ever considered what neg- ,
lecing your kidneys means?
Have you ever realized . the terrible
risk you are taking?
Do you not pass on the streets, every
day, men and women whose counten-
ances show that the final stake is up
and the die being cast?
How may you know them?
By their pale, sallow, sunken or
bloated countenances, dull, lack-luster â¢
.eyes, puffy or dark circles under the j
eyes. slow, languid movements, j
blotched, pimpled, unhealthy complex- j
ions, and general appearance of weak-
ness and debility.
In addition to their outward appear-
ance, how do they feel themselves?
Weak, worn out,, tired, languid, rest- J
less, nervous, irritable and worried
easily over trifles, feverish, chilly, short
of breath, dizzy, irregular heart, rheu- j
matic,' with pain or dull ache in the J
back, neuralgic, sleepless, generally de- I
bilitated and used up.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys cause ;
â  all these symptoms.

Tivoli.
. "The Mikado" was revived last even- ;
I in* at the Tivoli Opera-house. Those ex
! pecting much from j Gerald Gerome, who
had full opportunity to display his abili
* tie- were disappointed. However, it was :
; his first effort in the part and he has room
to improve. Aside from this the presenta- j
tion was in the usual style of the Tivoli ]
company and pleased the audience.
OFprieum.
The hit of the Orpheum's new bill is
Barnes and Sisson by a large majority. |
They have a lot of new material and their j
pongs and dances are a great go. Next
come the Dartos with their Parisian
dances. They have finish and snap to
their work, to say nothing of the cos
tuming that characterizes the Paris music
hall. The Gipsy Quintet, from which
much was expected, is no worse, and cer
tainly no better, than several such turns
that have been seen here. Percy Honri.
the concertinist. is a wonder in his way.
He gets a suprising amount of music out
of this commonplace instrument. Mr. and
Mrs. William Robyns have a very clever
little comedy skit in "Straight Tip Jim
It is full of witty slang of the racetrack
and a pathetic little story runs through
the plot. Mr. Robyns makes an ideal race
track tipster, while Mrs. Robyns .sustains
her part of the woman looking for a win
ner. Taken as a whole the bill s a good
one. J. W. Wlnton with his walking, talk
ing figures was the hit of the holdovers.
Alhambra.
Agnes Hemdon began an engagement
at the Alhambra Theater last evening in
the emotional play. "La Belle Marie.' It
is the pathetic story of an innocent coun
try girl, the daughter of. a Scotch me
chanic, who falls in love with the son of
her father's employer.
Olympia.
The Olympia has two good cardsâ the
one Signer Antonio Vargas, the famous
barytone, and the other Querita Vincent.
Each sot several encores last night, and
they are the feature of the bill of twelve
or more acts. Miss Vincent has a new
song that won for her four encores.
The Chutes.
Carl Sawvell and his colored quartet
held the stage for over half an hour at
the Chutes Free Theater last evening and
sang ten or twelve capital glees. Saw
vell is an excellent basso and his "King
O'er the Land and the Sea" is well worth
hearing. The four Miltons varied their
saxophone, calliope and bell quartets and
Sherman and Morrlssey, the "Indestruct
ible" comedians, continued . their bur
lesque trapeze performance. This is the
last week of Ethel Lynwood. the "human
knot " and the amateur cakewalk will be
1 given for the last time Thursday night.
MADAME . MELBA, INJURED.
A Falling Statue Strikes Her on the
Head, Rendering Her Un
conscious.
Through the accidental falling of a
bronze statue Mme. Melba had a narrow
escape from death or serious injury at
the residence of M. H. de Young on Sun
day night. ;4? .'.'.}-
With Manager Ellis and a number of
members of the company she "was the
guest of Mr. de Young. j After supper the
ladles withdrew to the drawing-room, and
Mme. Melba selected a chair in a cozy
corner of the room. She had hardly
seated herself when a pedestal, . sur
mounted by a" bronze statue, tilted for- l
ward. The statue slid off and struck the j
diva on the head, rendering her uncon- i
orders, lame back, dull pain or ache in
the back, gravel, catarrh of the. bladder,
rheumatism, sciatica, neuralgia, uric
acid troubles and Bright's disease,
which is the worst form of neglected
kidney trouble.
Swamp-Root corrects inability to hold
water and promptly overcomes that un-
pleasant necessity of being compelled
to go often during the day and to get
up many times during the night.
Swamp-Root is the great medical
triumph of the nineteenth century; dis-
covered after years of untiring effort
and research by the eminent kidney
and bladder specialist, -Dr. Kilmer, and
can be purchased at any drugstore in

aid was hurriedly summoned, and. to the
relief of all. it was soon ascertained that
the injury was not serious.
It is supposed that the back of Melba's
chair struck the pedestal and this cause
it to tilt sufficiently forward to jar the

THE NEW MILITIA BILL.
BEFORE Governor Gage signs the bill for the
reorganization of the National Guard he should
call into his counsel some of the leading offi
cers of that organization. Not being a military man,
the Governor will naturally be unable to understand
some of the provisions of the measure in question,
but that he ought to understand them before he at
taches his approval is a proposition which can scarcely
be controverted. As originally framed the bill was
more objectionable than it is now, but it still contains
a large number of so-called reforms which are of
doubtful, utility, and which may,' instead of placing the
National Guard upon a more substantial footing, j
thoroughly disorganize it. : - - 1
The war with Spain left the militia of California in
a somewhat disheveled condition, consequent upon
the enlistment of a large number of its members in the
United States Volunteer service, each enlistment hav
ing in law operated to discharge a guardsman. - But
the disappearance of men and the resignation of offi
cers do not call for the changes of system which are
made by the bill now before the Governor. Under our
method of government the chief executive of State
and nation is the commander in chief of the army and
.navy. The reason of this is perfectly plain. In
Rome the military commanders used to be indepen
dent, and as a result they often utilized their soldiers
to place them upon the throne. It is to make the
military department of the Government subordinate
to the judicial, civil and political departments that all
the generals are appointed by the President or Gov
ernor and arc made subject to his command.
The reorganization bill under discussion erects the
major general of the California militia into an inde
pendent official. It cuts down the Governor's staff,
and requires that some of his militia appointments
shall be approved by the major general; it fixes the
term of the latter at a definite period, and authorizes
him to act independently of- the Governor in the dis- |
charge of many of his duties, notably in ordering en- I
campments and carrying them out.
This is all wrong in principle and should not be
tolerated. Depriving the Governor of power over the
National Guard will not tend to reorganize that insti
tution, while it will infract a very important feature of
our system of government. If Governor Gage will
call to his aid the prominent officers of the militia
they will show him how this bill is certain to operate
to the disadvantage of the organization. We. are sat
isfied from a cursory reading of the measure that it
increases the expense of maintaining the Guard. This
alone is an objection which ought to appeal forcibly
to the Governor, who is on record as an economist
of most uncompromising character.
There are some good things in the bill, but they are
counterbalanced by the attempt to make the major
general of the militia an irresponsible commander.
We think that such an innovation will generally meet
the disapproval of the National Guardsmen.
The court which gave Dick Williams a new trial,
and then another, and promised him a third, was not
the Supreme Court of the State, as the entire matter
was within Federal jurisdiction. Inadvertently a
writer on this paper had accepted the theory that the
fault of William's escape lay with the Supreme Court.
An ex-convict emerging from an immurement of
ten years finds that the gold he buried before incar
ceration has been dug up! We do not hesitate to de
nounce this as not .having been a square deal. If there
is honor among thieves, now is the time for some
body to come forward.
Filipinos must not burn any of the American pris

any satisfaction for him to know it,' he is the meanest
creature. of his kind, and the best of the outfit to es
cape lynching got more than he deserved.
The Deputy Sheriff who murdered a boy at Colma
seems to have the worst excuse ever advanced. At
least, if anybody ever had a worse one he has been
hanged before now.
Senator Perkins says that'he kept out of the Sena-
t orial contest. 'He did this from choice. There were
several others who were never really in it, but who
tried to be.

THE CALL fIND PUBLIC OPINION
THE most noted contest in the history of Ameri
can politics closed when the Legislature ad
journed. ...â '. T
â¢ There had been failures before to elect a Senator.
There had been contests .which ended in taking up
side candidates and electing them, by the help of the
minority, like Christiancy in Michigan, Cameron in
Wisconsin and Tipton in Nebraska. But in each case
the. scat was contested for by the incumbent. Zach
"Chandler in Michigan, Mat Carpenter in Wisconsin
and Thayer in Nebraska were pushed aside by the fu
sion of a Republican minority with the Democratic
minority. .â¢'
. Here the case was different. A change in party con
trol had found a seat vacated by a Democrat to be
filled by a Republican. ' The record of the outgoing
Senator, with -but- little exception, was strong and
commendable, and his great ability had proved itself
in the Senate. His Republican colleague, without' the
advantage of a legal training, is yet so equipped in the
school of experience that he ranks well up and is a
most useful and creditable Senator.
It was the aspiration of the Republican party to fill
the vacant seat with a Senator worthy in ability to suc
ceed White and the equal in influence and usefulness
to Perkins.
When the candidacy of Burns appeared the party
was appalled. He represented a force that had here r
tofore been invincible. For more than thirty years the
Southern Pacific Railroad had never lost a battle in
California politics. No matter which party had a
majority in the State, the wishes of that corporation
had never been resisted nor denied successfully by
either. Indeed, so supreme had its power become that
it did not have to solicit an alliance. Both parties
sought its favor, and the one that was denied, seldom
put up a stout fight, but was content to' wait until it
was needed, when the fickle corporation would change
and use it as the instrumentality of its purpose. With
this record behind the power that supported him
Burns had grounds for the swagger with which he en
tered the fight. The Call recognized the natural
politics involved in giving the Senator to Southern
California, but we had no candidate. For reasons that
are now history we opposed both Grant and Burns.
As the long fight wore on it became plain that the
heretofore irresistible force behind Burns would lose
iio point nor spare any resource to effect his election,
and after clearing the air in the revelations of Speaker
Wright's serpentine and sinister part, thereby laying
bare also the ante-election incidents in Grant's cam
paign, we enlisted all the resources of The Call in the
service of the majority opinion and public judgment
of the State, which clearly ran against the election of
Burns. ..... !
The contest settled down finally to a siege. The
majority of the Republican members, representing a
majority of the party and the people, and standing
for the State's good name, stood the siege well. They
pursued no offensive tactics, but stood firmly on the
defense. The excellence of their discipline and their
loyalty to the right were proved by the fact that from
the .first ballot to the last only six men deserted them.
Every blandishment which can dazzle men and make
them forget tlie future and the past in the delirium
of the moment was exhausted, but the Republican
Old Guard stood firm, yielding not. We believed that
cur position was right when The Call announced it,
and our initiative was taken in advance of the use of
means for ascertaining public opinion, . but we as
sumed that the people were right on this issue, and
our confidence was not misplaced. The Call was in
line with the party and the people, and therefore won
its fight. It voiced public opinion when it pulled
Wright out of the Speaker's chair, in which he had
sat only seventeen days, enjoying briefly the fruits of
chicane and deception, and The Call has continued to
utter the public will to the close of this battle royal,
from which Burns retires defeated and discredited,
and in which the Southern Pacific Railroad has met
the first defeat in its history.
We by no means underestimate the value of the for
titude shown by Grant, Barnes and Scott. Grant' de
ported himself with dignity and decency, self-restraint
and wisdom, while Barnes and Scott never lost sight
of the fact that they, with Grant, were less candidates
for the Senate than they were trustees of the party's
future and the State's honor. Through it all The Call
has fought at the front, has fought fairly and has won
every objective point which it sought. The Southern
Pacific has discovered that ft is not the sole power in
this State, for the people of the State, must be
reckoned with. We* have not set down anything in
malice against that corporation. It has rights which
we will as readily defend against demagogues and
anarchists as we have just defended the people against
the corporation in a matter where it had no rights at
stake and wherein its presence should have been -un
known. We have taught the lesson that a newspaper
to have influence and power must align itself with en
lightened public opinion, and then must fight without
flinching. *
DIPLOMACY IN THE PHILIPPINES.
WHILE the results of the fighting between our
troops and the Filipinos have been on the
whole satisfactory, it is clear that an- attempt to
establish peace throughout the Philippines by strictly
military methods would entail a long and costly strug
gle. We could easily dispose of the insurgents if they
would come forth as one host in battle array, like the
Dervishes at Omdurman, but it will not be so easy
to track a thousand separate bands of marauders
through the jungles and the mountains.
From the reports that come to us from Manila it
appears the Filipinos have had sense enough to learn
already the difference between an American and a
Spanish force. In the earlier fights the insurgents
stood their ground with some firmness, and in one or
two instances even took the offensive and attacked our
lines with no other arms than bows and arrows.
They have now abandoned tactics of that kind and
are fighting like fleas on the jump. They snap at us
in one place, and when we reach for them they are
somewhere else. . -Â,-.
As a consequence of these tactics on the part of
the insurgents our troops have been compelled to re
sort to what are known as "punitive expeditions"-
that is to say, detachments are sept out to destroy.
property^ when they cannot find the enemy. Thus we
are told that a recent expedition, after having scat
tered a band of Filipinos, proceeded to burn five. miles
of huts and to destroy all the rice in the storehouses
and the growing crops in the fields. -â ""'-"â¢
Punitive tactics are very effective in civilized coun
tries and in the temperate zone, but are considerably
less so among semi-barbarians, in the tropics. The
Filipino is not much dismayed by the destruction of
his bamboo hut, for he can build another without any
cost for raw material and with no labor except that
of his wife and children. Neither does he care much
for his fields in a land where nature affords an abun
dant supply of vegetable food, and where, owing to
the climate, the amount of food required to sustain
life is very little. - .
For these reasons it is probable the settlement of
the Philippine imbroglio will depend more upon the

commissioners sent out by the President than upon
the army. It is noted that the natives have been more
impressed by the kind treatment accorded to prisoners
taken in battle than by the valor of our troops or the
deadliness of our arms. -When.it is clearly impressed
upon them that we do not mean to reduce them- to
such a condition of wretchedness as \hat imposed by
Spanish rule they will probably be willing to listen to
reason and accept our government peacefully as long
as we remain in the islands.
In the meantime it is certain" that in our dealings
with a people whom Kipling has described as "half
savage and half child" we shall have tq humor them a
good deal. Punishment for any attack upon our lines
must of course be swift and sharp. It will never do
to let them get the impression' in their minds that we
cannot whip them. At the same time it is going to be
so hard to catch the villains in order to whip them
that a considerable amount of coaxing will be judi
cious in the interests of economy.
UPON no set of our State officials is there rest
ing at this time. a more serious responsibility
than that with which -the Regents of the Uni
versity are charged by the duty of selecting a suc
cessor to President Kellogg. It is hardly too much to
j say that the. whole work of higher education in Cali
i fornia will be more or less affected by the personal in
! fluence of the man chosen, and therefore the choice to
j be made is one of no-ordinary moment.
â¢ Universities, ever since the days of the academy
' founded by Plato, have performed an important ser
vice in shaping the course of civilization, but never in
human history was the influence of such institutions
so potent as at this time. The increased reliance of
men upon science to devise solutions for the social
.problems and needs of the age has given the uni
versity a leadership which it never had before, and
has rendered the personal characters of its president
and its professors matters of no small concern to the
community. â¢ â¢
The time when a university was simply a seat of
I scholarship is past. The people now turn to the uni
] versities for lecturers on all forms of knowledge and
!on all issues that arise. From farmers' clubs, from j
! literary societies, from university extension associa- i
; tions, from reform organizations, and even from politi-'
i cal committees, come demands upon them for a j
| scientific study of the problems of the time and a |
â  popular exposition of them.
The presidency of a university is now a vantage
point from which a strong, clear-headed, wise man
can make himself widely useful to the community. A
small man in such a position is worse than nothing,
for his inability to use-*the power the position gives
renders that power valueless to the community, and
one of the greatest forces of civilization is therefore
lost to that people.
Regent Rodgers, who has just returned from an j
extensive tour made for the purpose of seeking out j
a man well fitted for the presidency of the University, |
is reported to have stated that he has investigated the '
I qualifications of ten. men, and is prepared to submit
; a report at the meeting of the Regents in April. This i
probably means that the question will then be settled
and the selection made. That being so, it is well at j
j this time to remind the Regents that they are choos- j
: ing- a man not merely to teach young men and ;
women the learning that can be found in books, but
! a leader of the higher thought of the State. If they
i cannot find at this time a man who measures up to
j that standard they had better postpone the election
! and put the presidency in commission for a while.
AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS METHODS
A RECENT number of the Exporter, a Sydney
publication devoted to the export trade of the
Australian colonies, gives, concerning the fruit
trade with Europe, a good deal of information likely
to be not only interesting but instructive to Califor
nia!*?, since it shows the vigor with which the people
of those far-off countries are striving to compete with
us in that line of industry.
From the reports given it appears the Australians
ship to England not only fresh fruit but even fresh
vegetables, and the announcement is made that aspar
agus and green peas arriving in England between No
vember and March are sure to bring good prices. The
chief difficulty to be overcome in the trade in fresh
fruit is that of preserving it during the Jong voyage
across the ocean, though of course the heavy freight
rates also constitute a handicap on the enterprise.
Both in Victoria and in New South Wales the fruit
men, aided by their Governments, arc energetically
ard scientifically striving to master these obstacles.
It i** noted by the Exporter that the Victorian Gov
ernment grants a bonus on fruit exports, and in that.
way/offsets' the freight charges and stimulates pro
ducer, and shippers to devise some means of pre
serving the fresh fruit so as to make the shipments
profitable . â¢
' Several plans have been tried, but none seems to be
wholly satisfactory. The one most in favor at present
â¢seems .to be what is known as the "Southerland pro
cess," which amounts virtually to inclosing the fruit
in waxed paper bags.. In the meantime the Govern
ment has been lending its aid to the work and the
Agricultural Department is experimenting â¢ with" a
process of preserving fresh fruit by means of ster
ilized air. It is said that some apricots treated in
that way by the department were kept in good con
dition for forty-three days, but the bloom had faded
and the fruit would not be attractive in the market.
It is worth noting that the British correspondent
of the Exporter advises fruit and vegetable shippers
to send their goods direct to Manchester instead of
London or Liverpool, on the ground that the markets
of the two last-named cities are the general dumping
ground for the exports of all nations, while Man
chester, with. the swarming populations of the manu
facturing cities around it, is a comparatively over
looked market for such articles.
Another illustration of the comprehensive manner
with* which the Australians are seeking- to increase
the consumption of the products of their industry is
found in an announcement in the same journal that
the Government of Victoria has induced the railroads
to serve a tumbler of colonial wine with lunch or
dinner at all their eating-houses without extra charge
and to furnish it by the bottle at a shilling a quart.
By that means it is expected to make the use of native
wine common among the people and thus build up a
large home market for it. â¢ x
It will be seen from these reports, all of. which are
given in the ordinary course of a trade review, that
the Australians, though far from the great markets of
the world, are not sitting in idleness waiting for some
one to come along and help them. Through their
Governments as well as by individual enterprise they
are working out a solution of their difficulties and
bid fair to succeed.
â  There was something distressing in the thought of
the electrocution of a woman in New York, but now
that it is over it seems to have been the proper course.
With the Oregon- at Manila some of the powers
would better, put on their good behavior.

and Public.
SOME SUPERVISORS DISAGREE
HEATED DEBATE ON BEPOBT OF
GAS INVESTIGATION.
Dr. Perrault Presents a Minority Be
port Which Is Finally Received .
but Consideration De
ferred One Week.
An acrimonious debate marked the pro
ceedings of the Board of Supervisors yes
terday when an attempt was.made to fix
the rates to be charged the city by the'
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company
for lighting the streets and public build
ings. â  -"'^v
A searching inquiry was. made by the
board recently as to the cost of gas, and
a report was expected from the Finance
"Committee, which had charge of the in
vestigation, yesterday. Mayor Pheian pre
cipitated the -discussion by asking if the
report on the gas question was ready.
Dr. Perrault replied: "I am ready to
present a minority report, which my as
sociates on the committee refuse to sign."
Supervisor Collins said: "As a member
of that committee I wish to say that I am
not ready to report, but will do so next
week. I object to the reading of the mi
nority report." â¢ ; .*" â¢
"I conferred with Mr. Collins in this
matter," rejoined Perrault, "and as his
report Is ready _ believe it should be sub
mitted now.".
"The doctor is mistaken if he thinks he
knows all I have to report," replied Col
lins. "I merely told, him one thingâ there
Is much more to be embodied in the re
port. I will bring in a report next week,
although I do not know whether any one
will sign it."
"The minority. report is ready first and
should be received by this board," said
Perrault. "J want to resign the chair
manship of the Finance Committee and
want to clean up all the work on hand.
In this case the other members of the
committee do not agree with my ideas
and those of his Honor the Mayor."
Here Attridge took a hand. "I don't
think it is necessary to read this minority
report," he said.
Collins indignantly chimed in: "I don't
like the way this come about. This re
port was presented to me at 3:30 o'clock
for my signature. This, gave me no
chance for investigation 'and is not the
proper way to proceed. I won't have any
report crowded down my throat. When
ever I have any report to make I present
it to my associates on the committee be
fore we enter this room."
Perraultâ l did not intend to ("light the
committee. The course I took is the usual
one. It is customary for the chairman of
a committee to prepare the report and
take the leading part in its presentation.
The other members of this committee did
not take the active Interest in this inves
tigation which they should have done.
Mayor Pheian ended the debate by say
ing it could be received as a resolution if
not as a minority report.
When it came up for the -second time
it was laid over for one week. Perrault,
Lackmanii and Deasy voting against such
action, .-. -
The report, which follows, is interesting;
showing as it does that the city pays one
third more for lighting than It should be
charged, and that the general public is
charged an exorbitant price for gas. The
report submitted by Dr. Perrault reads:
PAN FRANCISCO,' March 20. 1899;
To the Honorable the- Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San FranciscoâGen
tlemen: Your Committee on Finance and Au
diting beg leave to report in the matter of the
bills of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company and. the Pacific Gas Improvement
Company for the months of December ' and
January, as follows:
The Superior Court has decided that the con
tracts under which gas and electricity were
supplied to the city and county of San Fran
cisco are void, but that the companies are en
titled to reasonable compensation for com
modities- furnished, and that it is the duty of
the board to fix such reasonable compensa
tion. Your committee has held an investiga
tion, .giving full arid fair opportunity to all
parties in Interest to be heard, and herewith
submits a sfenographlc report of such Investi
gation for the information of the board. We
have, elicited the following facts, as an ex
amination of said report will show:
That the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company Is a combination of the San Fran
cisco Gaslight and the Edison Light and Power
Company: that before or after such combina
tion mfcst of the competing companies that had
been organized for the purpose of supplying the
city with lighting (gas and electricity) have
been absorbed and that the present capital
stock upon which dividends are paid does not
represent their real value; that rates are kept
excessively high in order to pay dividends on
fictitious capitalization;- that in the matter of
electric light the city pays more. in many in
stances, than is charged to private consumers:
that the cost of gas delivered to the consumer
ls less than $1 a thousand cubic feet: that
competing companies will. if given facilities,
supply the city with electric light of equal can
dle power for at least 33H per cent less than
is now charged the city. For these reasons we
Firstâ That the electric light bills In dispute
be settled on a basis of 25 per cent less than
the amount charged and that the gas bills be
settled at the rate of $1 35 per thousand cubic
feet.
Secondâ That the rate to consumers be fixed
on a graduated scale, as follows: Beginning
July 1, 1889, one year. $1 50 per thousand-, and
for the years succeeding that the rate be fixed
â¢respectively at $1 45. $1 35, $1 30 and $1 25. thus
at the end of live years reducing the price of
gas to $1 25 per thousand cubic feet to con
sumers; that these prices will yield a fair and
reasonable return on the real value of . the
company's plant, used for. the manufacture and
distribution Of gas ani electric light.
Third We recommend that new specifications
be prepared for lighting the city streets,
squares, public buildings, with gas and elec
tric light, which will admit competition. -and
that new proposals bo Invited and ln accord
ance with the Judgment of the court a new con
tract let. "' : ' : â â ;
A. M. Hunt, a civil engineer, presented !
! a voluminous report as to the cost of an
I electric plant for lighting the streets and
! municipal buildings. The present cost of
I this lighting is $400,000 per year. With its
I own plant the cost would be $170,000. Mr.
| Hunt estimates the cost of a plant and
I distribution system at $459,000. This does
not Include real estate upon which it
would be Installed. The communication
i was referred to the Street Light Commit
tee and also ordered printed for distribu
tion, among the members of the board. '
This was not the only light shed upon
the question of illuminating the city. The
following communication was received

offer (said fifteen days being necessary for
making underground. connections with electric
wires in said City HaY) at a rate or price of
6 cents per thousand watt hours, being 40 per
cent less than the 'price which the city and
county has been and is. now paying for electric
current used ln the City Hall. We will furnish
suoh bonds as may be required as a guaranty
for the quality of the' light and the efficiency
of the service.

The Pacific -Surety Company, which in
sures boilers, reported to the board that
the hot water heaters in the Free Library
and County Clerk Deane's office were in
bad condition. They were pronounced
worn out and unfit for use. It was .sug
gested that the pipes leading to. the heater
be covered, thus giving better service
on the use of less fuel. A report was also
rendered on the steam boilers which sup
ply power for the building. The report
States that there is but one -safety valve
for these two boilers. "In getting up
steam in the cold boiler, which' has no
safety valve,'-' says the report, "the only
thing the man in charge has to go by 19
the steam gauge, and. should anything
go wrong with it there is no possible
means of knowing what pressure may be
on the boiler. This state of affairs should
not be allowed to exist any longer than
the time it takes to remedy It."
DR. WEBB AND THE
NICKEL-IN-THE-SLOT
CAPTURED BY ITS SEDUCTIVE
- INFLUENCES.
He Struck a Royal Plush and Now
Has a Machine of His
Own.
The Vanderbilts have stamped the nick
! el-in-the-slot machine as the proper thing.
( The deceptive little box with its straights
! and flushes and full hands, which sepa
| rate so many nickels from their specula- '
' tive owners, has won the hearts of the |
! Vanderbilts. and that is almost enough to j
j wipe out all the harsh things the preach- I
ers and Supervisors have said about them.
The seductive jingle of the nickel falling i
into the box, the click, click of the op
erating rod and the whirr, whirr of the :
cards have literally entranced the Van- !
derbilts, and now the Vanderbilts have
i one of their own.
Nickel-in-the-slot gambling was the first !
! purse-loosening amusement that caught
; the eyes of the Vanderbilt party
i when they rolled into the State in their
I private pleasure cars. At Santa Barbara
; Dr. W. S. Webb, brother-in-law to Come;
-; lius Vanderbilt Jr. and president of the
! Wagner Car Company, dropped into a
; cigar stand on the main street and no
, ticing, the nickel-in-the-slot machine
! standing invitingly on the counter he in
quired what its use was. The cigar dealer
i explained to his inquisitor that all it cost
I to play it was a nickel, and a person was
! liable at any time to get a royal flush.
"If you get a royal flush you get a hun
i dred fine cigars," said the cigar merchant,
1 with the air Of a man who was used to
paying off on a royal flush two or three
times every day.
"A hundred for a royal flush, and it only |
costs* a nickel to play it," . retorted the l
doctor. "Well, I guess I'll try it."
"The main guy of the Vanderbilt par*- |
ty," as Patsy Carroll would term Dr. !
Webb if. he were telling the story, threw a
half dollar on the counter and asked for j
i a few nickels.
The cigar dealer, only â¢ too willing to
change ' half dollars when there was a
prospect of somebody going up against his
own game, handed the doctor five shining !
nickels and -â¢ quarter, winking at the j
same time to some of his statues standing
in front.
The man of money and cars - dropped I
.the first nickel in the slot. Click went the i
rod and then the. cards began to turn. j
When they stopped Dr. Webb began to
count his hand. .
'Ten, jack, queen, king, ace, and all one
coâ" .'â¢*'â¢
"All one what?" chipped in the cigar
dealer, as he stretched his neck to see Dr.
Webb's hand.
"All one color. That's a royal, flush,
isn't it?" asked the doctor, with. an as
sumed air of innocent surprise.
"I think that's right," said the crest
fallen dealer. ' â  â¢
. Dr. Webb got his cigars, but he liked
; the game and remained at the stand some
i little time playing the machine.
When the Vanderbilts arrived at the
i foot of Townsend street the other day Dr.
| Webb came up town and invested $20 in
i a brand new nickel-in-the-slot machine,
I and he didn't say it was for the baby,
' either.
Evidently the doctor thinks there is
more profit in runing a nickel-in-the-slot
i machine than building cars. Or perhaps
the doctor intends to keep dropping nick
els in the machine until he gets another .
royal flush and pay himself. for the win
ning. Or he may want to play the ma
chine a while and see how much percent
age he would lose if he continued to go
up against the other fellow's nickel win
! ner. However, it may be that he may
i want to do business with the members of
i the Vanderbilt family.

AMERICAN MAIL
THROWN ASIDE
BY CANADIANS
Twenty Tons Rotting
Near Skaguay.
CARRIERS WILL NOT TOUCH IT
â ,
: THE INTERNATIONAL POSTAL
AGREEMENT VIOLATED.
_â
Only Letters Bearing the Dominion
. y . Postage Axe at the Present
Time Transported Over the- â¢
Pass by Contractors.
The postal service to and from the
Klondike has been most unsatisfactory
for many months, and friends and rela
tives of the gold seekers in the frozen
j north have long been puzzled over the
fact that their letters have never reaphed
their destination. The fault lies with the
Canadian contractors who are employed
to transport the mail. Letters come out
from Dawson and other points in fairly
good condition and as quickly as can be
reasonably expected. But the mail going
the other way is sidetracked.
The explanation of this condition is the
fact that the contractors who bargained
with the Canadian Government to carry
the postal matter from Skaguay to Daw
son refuse to handle any mall which does
not bear the Canadian postage. Mail
matter from the United States is thrown
aside when it leaves the steamer, and at
the present time it is estimated that
twenty tons bearing American stamps is
piled up in heaps at Skaguay. Thousands
and thousands of letters from anxious
friends and relatives who have not heard
from the venturesome men who went Into
the land of ice to dig for gold are rotting
in the open or being blown into the gul
lies and sea and will never be delivered.
The anxiety of the snow-imprisoned
miners can be imagined when month after
month passes and no word comes from
home. Then, too. there are hundreds of
unfortunates who staked all their ready
I cash to defray the expenses of the inward
I trip, and this money has been exhausted
since they reached the alluring gold fields.
These men have been unsuccessful, and
they are hanging around Dawson waiting
for money from home to bring them back
to civilization. The letters containing re
mittances are in the discarded mail at
the seaboard, and the persons to whom
they are addressed are in desperate
straits in .consequence thereof.
Frank Jaqua, a young man from Pater
son, N. J., who went- over the Chukoot a
year ago, has returned by the same
ink Jaqua, a young man from Pater-
X. J., who went over the Chilkoot a
ago, has just returned by the same
route. He brought messages to several
people in this city from stranded miners
to whom money had been sent, but they
had never received it and could not un
derstand why their correspondents here
had not responded to their requests.
Jaqua made a personal Investigation of
affairs at Skaguay, and he solemnly de
clares that carload upon carload of mail
from the United States is lying. there in
heaps and that the Canadian carriers will
not transport it over the pass. He in
formed a Call- reporter that the only sure
means of getting a. letter into Dawson is
| to first send it over the Canadian line, to
j Victoria or some other point, enclosed in
another envelope and have some friendly
person repost -it with- a' Canadian stamp
I attached. 'â¢ â¢ * " * "
. Since his return to civilization Jaqua
has received information from his home
.that his relatives and friends, wrote 'â  him
repeatedly and that they were surprised
to read in his letter from the Klondike
that he was not receiving any mail. He
located the cause at Skaguay and called
on the Canadian postal authorities there,
but got no satisfaction. He was curtly
informed by the contractors that they
were not paid to carry ' American mail
over the passes and that they would not
touch the post coming from the States.
A well known lawyer in this city whose
brother- is mining near Dawson, when he
learned from the Paterson man the true
condition of affairs; decided to report the
matter to the postal authorities at Wash
ington. The refusal of the Canadian car
riers to handle American mail is a viola
tion of the international postal agreement
and in all probability the Dominion Gov
ernment will be requested to investigate.
In the meantime all persons wishing to
communicate with friends in the Klondike
will be wise to send their missives to some
one in Canada and have them remail
them. â¢ â  .
Jaqua does not think the Klondike a
very good place for miners. His partner
is an expert mining engineer and both say
the country has been overrated. They
went there as the representatives of a
wealthy syndicate, in" which Vice Presi
dent Hobart is interested, and during the
past year have traveled extensively
through the regions where digging is go
ing on. While a few lucky argonauts have
struck it rich, the majority of the thou
sands who rushed into Alaska expecting
to get wealth quickly will return with
empty pockets. â¢

had the sailor in a tight place and foolishly went into a mix-up when he

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 20.â market, after
a sensational movement in sugar and the local
transportation shares, closed weak with mixed
r.et changes. Interest centered largely in sugar,
in which the transactions were over 191,000
shares, with a total of about 900,000 shares.
Sugar opened with an advance of about 8
points, ran off 3% and then touched 182, with
a subsequent plunge of IS points, closing with
a net loss of about S points. . The extraordinary
movement of this stock had a wide influence
in other directions; Brooklyn Transit was
lifted over 6 points and then lost much of the
gain. Pronounced strength appeared in the
Vanderbilts. Union Pacifies, Northwestern, the
coalers and Chicago Terminal, while some of
the internationals made a show of strength in
the early dealings in sympathy with the higher
range in London. . The tobacco stocks were
extremely feverish. American Tobacco broke
6%, rallied '.< and left off with a loss of 2; Con
tinental Tobacco slumped 14*4 and was off 3
points at the close. The liquidation in these
stocks was attributable to the reported forma
tion of a new opposition tobacco company.
Manhattan retained the greater part of a 4
point rise. There was a disposition of the
professional element to let- commission house
purchasers have stocks, and subsequently
while sugar was tumbling and call money
reached 9 per cent, prices were freely offered
down. Standard stocks, while easing with the
recent market, receded in an orderly manner,
and the reaction in those securities from the
best did not exceed two points except In special
cases. Money on call toward the close eased
with the last loan at 4 and offered at 3, but
the market failed to respond to the changed
conditions due to the supply of money offered
and the reaction ' was unchecked to the end.
The strength in Brooklyn Transit was coinci
dent with the published interview with the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit Railroad to the effect
that an exchange of the majority of Brooklyn
Transit elevated stocks for Brooklyn Rapid
Transit stock ha been arranged. The ad
vance in Union Pacific and New York Central
was timed with the announcement of the re
turn of the leading interest In Vanderbilt
stocks, an 1 gave rise to a renewal of rumors
that Union Pacific might be absorbed by the
New York Central. The opinion -was ex
pressed because of the action of the market
that the rise in London, which was a pur
chaser at the opening only, was manipulated
from this side to facilitate the liquidation
which was evident in the market."
Bond prices to-day were raised generally.

I was directly due to a sudden influx of orders

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 20.â There were a number of
strong factors In the wheat market at the corn-
'. mencement, and traders started business in a !
j bullish mood. Cables were higher and freezing i
I weather was reported in .the wheat belt, which
i It was thought might prove damaging to the I
| growing plant. The statistics were also re- j
| garded as rather favorable to the buying side. j
World's shipments were considerably smaller j
than expected, and the amount :on ' passage '
showed an increase for the week of only 80,000
bushels. May opened %i&%c higher at 67%@
68% c, and as crop damage claims became more I
numerous than ever the price rose to .6S , .â¢
68% c. Apparently reliable reports from both
the Northwest and Southwest regarding farm- :
ers' deliveries were to the effect that receipts
.were being heavily reduced and in many cases j
were insufficient for the requirements of the j
local millers. As the senders of this informa- â¢
tion backed up their claims with messages to I
buy, shorts became nervous and covered freely,
advancing May to 68% c. The market ruled very !
firm the greater part of the session, but near j
the end the taking of profits by scalper's re- I
suited in a reaction to 67% c, and the price at \
the close was 67% c buyers.
Light country acceptances and small receipts i
strengthened corn. A fairly good speculative i
business was done at 'some 'improvement
In prices. A good cash demand ana consid- '
erable buying of July by the country helped I
oats. â¢As the session neared the' close, how- j
ever, selling caused a loss of more than half j
the advance. May began %c up, at 26c, rose to |
26% c and closed at 25% c.
Provisions opened strong In sympathy with |
the buoyancy of the grain markets, but later j
lost the advance on selling out by the tired I
longs,' who â  were evidently awaiting firmness i
on which to market their holdings. May pork
closed 5@7%c lower, lard 2%@6c lower and ribs I
unchanged.

COFFEEâ C. E.-. Bickford's circular gives the
receipts at this port for the first two months
of the year at 31,871 bags, against 24,039 bags
during the same time in 1898. The sales from
first- hands were 21,352 bags, against 18,580. The
stock In first hands March 1 was 16,357 bags,
against 10,701. The world's visible supply
March 1 was 6,522,000 -bags, against 6.024, 925.
The circular says:
"Our last circular was dated February 7,
since which time the market has been active
and firm for the very highest and the very
lowest qualities, and decidedly irregular and
soft for all intermediate grades. Having but
one small arrival since the 19th of February,
the market has not afforded a sufficient- supply
of those qualities most in request to satisfy
the demand and a large' business Is still pos
sible in strictly prime to fancy Guatemala at
the top prices given, and also in inferior coffees
of any growth costing not over 7%c per pound.
In addition to the sales given at. the end of
this circular, quite a- business has been done
in unwashed Salvadors for forward deliveries
at slightly less than the basis of present spot
quotations, and Is still going on.
"The New York market for Brazil coffees has
no features of encouragement to holders, the
quotations there for spot and futures having
steadily gone off. ' â  >'

THi. b'iOGK MARKET.
Rather more tone was shown by mining
stocks owing to the publication of the weekly
reports showing considerable .activity at the
mines, and some stocks sold a few cents higher
than 'on Saturday. A telegram from the pump
read as follows: "Machinery for rearranging
the elevator of 'the Rlsdon pumping plant ar
rived here on .Saturday night. It is now being
put together and will. be in place in a few days
arid pumping resumed."
Local securities were fairly active, with a
rise in Hana Plantation.
The- Belcher assessment of 10c per share will
be delinquent in the company's office to-day.
The Gwin Mining Company of California
paid a dividend of 25c per share on March 10.
- Th- Best & Belcher and Gould & Curry com
panies have repurchased the steam hoist plant
now in place at the Obiston shaft from the
Fulton foundry, to whom It had been sold long
ago, and will begin the erection of a new shaft
house and gallows frame for the same.
In the Sierra Nevada mine the north drift
from the northwest drift on the 140 level was
advanced 22 feet; total length 233 feet. The
face Is in low-grade quartz. Since the weekly
letter was written an upraise has been started
from the end of this drift. .In the Union shaft
workings of the Sierra Nevada the south drift
from the top of the raise, SO feet above the
800 level, is out 112 feet. The face Is In por
phyry and clay. .___._-
In the Best & Belcher and Gould & Curry
mines, ln the drift connecting with the Obis
ton shaft, a great mass of old timbers and rock
has been cleaned out from and near the' shaft.
A little air is beginning to' circulate through
the shaft. â¢ - 'ââ  * ,_._..,
In the Hale & Norcross mine the work of
cleaning out- and repairing the connecting drift
between the main incline and the Sutro tunnel â 
south lateral branch is * progressing favorably.
The official report from the Consolidated Cal
ifornia and Virginia mine for the past week
states that on the 1400-foot level, at the point
of. intersection of the west drift with the north
and southwest drifts, there is some heavy
ground that has to be carefully timbered, and
five sets, or thfrty feet, have been repaired.
A line of air pipe has been carried fro*- the
shaft to the face of the drift and connected
with a tour-Toot fan and a five-horse-power
electric motor that will be started up as soon
as the water is again turned into the pressure
pipe. It has been decided. to run directly west
to the Consolidated Virginia shaft from the
Junction of the northwest and southwest drifts
on this level instead of following the north
west drift, as the distance is shorter to reach
the stopes and there is quite a stretch of un
prospected ground between this point and the
hanging wall of the old bonanza. 1650 levelâ
The drift ha been cleaned out to the point of
Intersection with the footwall raise, used when
prospecting work was being done at the time
when all work was suspended in July last.
Large quantities of eleven and fifteen-inch air
pipe have been taken out of caving and aban
doned drifts, and there is still a lot of T rail
that can be profitably removed from this level.
Air passages and main drift will have to be
kept open on this level for the purpose of se
curing a circulation of air through the levels
below and for the safety of the mine. In the
neighborhood of the last fire on this level they
have built a series of light bulkheads to pre
vent the too rapid circulation of air through
the burnt district. 1750 levelâ Of the main
wept drift 208 feet have been repaired, retlm
bered and track laid,, making In all a repaired
drift of 358 feet, and the station as remodeled
Is forty-two feet long. The repairs ln the west
drift have been carried to a point where the
bulkhead was built to control the last fire. The
electric Installation for present requirements Is
complete.
In the Ophir mine. in the old Central tunnel
workings, crosscut No. 1 was started during
the past week at a point 126 feet northeast
from the main west drift. It will make a
good crosscut of the vein and, it has been driven
fourteen feet in a mixture of quartz, clay and.
porphyry. A west drift is being cleaned out so
as to obtain a better supply of air. On the
Sutro tunnel level of the Ophlr work has con
tinued in the connection drift, which la, out
thirty-two feet ln very hard rock of the hang
ing wall. .

COMPROMISE
Lively Meeting Held
Yesterday.
ONLY ONE SIDE HEARD
FINAL ACTION WAS DEFERRED
UNTIL NEXT THURSDAY.
Attorney Crests-ell Urges Them Not
to Further Complicate Matters
by Refusing the Offer of the
Merchant Creditors.
About five hundred teachers met in the
auditorium of the Girls' High School yes
terday afternoon to consider the compro
mise offered by the merchant creditors of
the late School Board. They listened to
reports from the secretaries of various
committees; a long speech by Harry T.
Oreswell and other counsel, did a great
deal of talking and finally adjourned to
meet next Thursday afternoon, when final
action will be taken.
The meeting was called to order shortly i
after 4 o'clock by Elisha Brooks. He In- i
troduced C. H. Murphy and W. D. Kings- !
bury, who have been it Sacramento look- !
ing after legislation which interested the i
teachers. The two gentlemen -rave a very I
good account of themselves. Colonel :
Murphy first made an oral report, and it
was afterward supplemented by a written
one read by Mr. Kingsbury, which cover- J
ed- practically the same ground. A brief
excerpt from it tells the whole story: [
'"Every bill we tried to have passed went
through and those which did not stand
our scrutiny were defeated.*- An itemized !
list of expenditures was then read, which :
show- that it had cost the committee
$415 75 to do its work. This was so satis
factory that when Miss Emma Stincen,
who acts as treasurer, showed that a
little more money would be needed all
agreed to an assessment of 35 cents,
Messrs. Murphy and Kingsbury were
tendered a unanimous rising vote of j
Harry T. Creswell. one of the attorneys
for the teachers, then made a long state
ment. He went carefully over the ground,
covering every move made since last De
cember, explaining clearly why certain ;
actions which some considered the proper
thing-had not been taken. He said that ,
he, as one of the attorneys, had not only
endeavored to straighten out the tangle
' but had taken only such steps as would
prove most expeditious. He advised
strongly against suing the merchants to
prove the illegality of the latters' claims.
"Such a course," said he "would in
volve us in a long and expensive litiga
tion. The late school board was anything
but systematic. There are no records to
show "what was purchased and we would
be obliged to carefully question the book
keepers and managers of establishments
holding claims. The Judge would, in all
probability; appoint a referee at $10 per
cay to take evidence. Then there would
be the fees of an attorney and a stenog
rapher. Everything would have to be
taken down in full and when the notes
were transcribed we would have a pile of
evidence about three reet high. This is no
exaggeration. My advice to you. as your
attorney, is that you accept the com
promise offered by the merchants. It is
the safest course. The merchants claims
ac -~-e-*"-ie $â¢*â¢*- Â°*'"'- and there is nothing at j
it _ t-u-- to J_i-i-Â«.r them from drawing I
c"Â this =urn. There Is but $25,000 to
imeet this with, and the other $33,000 would i
have to be drawn from the ~eneral fund.
If this is done the chances are that your
â -a'aries will asrain be shaved in -day or
June The merchants oner you 5-J per cent
of this sum. or $44,000. My advice U* that
vou 'accent it and avoid litigation."
- Hp was followed by Lewis Bartlett who
Wad letters from Auditor Wells. P*. A.
B^rgerot. I. J. Truman and others advls-
Ingithls course. Other speakers followed
him on the same lines, and at the conclu
sion of their remarks a motion was made
that the compromise be accepted. .he
result was chaos.
There â Â»-..-" apparently two strong iac
tiorÂ« one which favored the compromise
and I the other bitterly opposed to it. Two
score people started to talk at once and
Pr/4d-nt Brooks rapped sharply several
times before order could be restored Then
a motion was made to adjourn until next
Friday It was voted do*** A teacher in
the rear of tho hall finally secured the
fioor and made a strong plea against the
adoption of the resolution. He said that
onjv one side had been 6"â and nothing
could be lost by making a short delay. It
was too late to do any more talking, so
theltnoUon to adjourn 'was finally passed,
T*uâ¢-_J_ instead of Friday being chosen
ei'the Sb* for the next meeting.

ALLOTMENT LAW EVADED.
Attempts to Ship a Fifteen-Dollar
Crew on the James Drummond.
United States Shipping Commissioner
Gwin has tied up the American ship
Jam.es Drummond and the vessel will be
unable to obtain a crew until the author
ities at Washington, D. C, have been
heard from. The ship is owned in Bath,
Me-., and came to this port with a mis
cellaneous cargo. Her master, James
Skew- Intends to clear for London and
Liverpool direct, and had made all his
preparations for engaging a crew at $15
per month per man.
As the regular going rate of wages for
twenty-two consecutive months for deep
water sailors had been $20, the Commis
sioner suspected that something was
wrong and telegraphed to Washington,
D. C. yesterday for instructions. -
Only a short time ago Congress cut
down the allotment of advances on deep
water sailors to one months-p ay. Hence
It was expected that the keepers of sailor
boarding-nouses would so arrange mat
ters as to ship men ostensibly at $15 per
month and draw down the other $5 per
month by collusion with the captain.

Dr. C. F. Burgess, who lives to the St.

March 8 Paul Egry, the well-known vio

violin was out of order and he asked for
the loan of the doctor's Instrument, which
is valued at $250. Egry got it and took it

MORE CONFISCATED FISH.
A Big Seizure Which Will Go to
Charitable Institutions.
The children of the Hebrew and Protest
. ant orphan asylums and the inmates of
J the Almshouse will rejoice to-day when
! their dinners are served! Such fish as
| they will eat cost wealthy men good mon
! ey, for striped bass is one of the luxuries
. of the tables of those who can afford to
have good things. For some time the fish
j ermen up the rivers have been catching
striped bass weighing less than three
I pounds, the lfmit marked by the State
j laws. As it is difficult to convict the of
! fenders the deputies of the Fish Commis
sion have decided to cause them all the
annoyance possible, and so every bass un
der weight is seized and given to those
who are dependent upon the people in
general for their support- â¢: . â¢ .
On Saturday Deputy John H. Davis
seized 1&0 pounds of these fish that ar
rived from Sobrante. and yesterday â¢_â "-")
pounds more were confiscated on the wa
ter front by the same officer. The fish run
from one and a half to three pounds, and
i in order that the lot might ecape the
! eyes of the officers a layer of flounders
j and sole was placed over the top of each
box. The Fish Commissioners are deter
â¢ mined to break up this illegal catching of
I striped bass if possible.
The Fighting Jockey.
Frederick Maynard. known as the fight-
Ing jockey, was yesterday held to answer
before the Superior Court by Judge Con
lan on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon, in $1000 bonds. March 9, during a
fight in the Thalia, Maynard stabbed Jo
seoh Calderon, a machinist, six times
with a pocket knife, but none of the
wounds was dangerous.
In the Divorce Courts.
Gerald Cullen was granted an annul
ment of marriage from Mary J. "Cullen"
yesterday on the ground that the defend
ant had a husband living in the person of
Joseph Rlggs when the litigants entered
into the marriage contract. Suits for di
vorce have been filed by Ralph M. Knowl
ton against Nellie Knowlton. for cruelty:
Alta Fluger against Henry M. Fluger. for
â¦"a'lure to provide; Francis O. Zwisler
against George A. Zwisler. for failure to
provide; Martha R. Lascette against Har
vey N. Lascette, for infidelity, and Mary
E. Kenney against John B. Kenney for

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrcp Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing 1 the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
Other "aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Bteup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
. effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

fWhen I see a man who is an easy and steady eater and
a sound and regular sleeper, . I see a man who has no oc-Â«
casion to be afraid of the world, the flesh or the devil. For.
from those still solemn hours of the night, when human
figures lie like recumbent statues in the darkness, and from
those other hours when busy forks and fingers deliver to
the mouth the food which the palate stands ready to wel-Â«
comeâ from these two things, I say, proceeds all human'
power, together with the clearness and sanity of mind which*,
leads it to every valuable accomplishment.
"When we sleep," said Leigh Hunt, "is the time when tha
mysterious spirit goes to take its airy rounds." "I advisa
you to sleep in peace and wake in Joy," said Sir Walter
Scott. "Sleep," said Bulwer. "is the happiest of earthly
boons." "Sleep," said a poet-philosopher of Boston, "lingers
' all our lifetime near our eyes as the night hovers all day im
What these gentle men say is very good and fine, and
makes sleep seem as easy a thing to come at as a ham
sandwich is to the fellow who has five cents still left in his
pocket. Nevertheless, if you could take the roofs off tha
houses and look down into them from above, passing from
one to another, swift as Asmodeus, you would see millions
_^ of people tumbling about on their beds, praying in vain to
j^__J the somnolent gods from early evening to the crack of day.
*~^r "I couldn't sleep," writes a lady. "I tossed and tumbled

Dr. Cook Fails to Pay
Overdue Alimony.
. â¢
ONLY RECENTLY DIVORCED
WENT TO RENO TO BEAT THE
STATE LAW.
He Faces His First Wife in Court and
Tells of Another Wife and
Small Family, to
Support.
r * ~' Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
906 Broadway, March 20.
â  Dr. Cook, the well known physician, is
In a peck of trouble. lie has been married
to two women, and both of them expect
him to support them. Not many months
Ago Dr. Cook figured in the Oakland di
vorce courts. His wife narrated a tale of
unhappiness which impressed the Judge
as being sufficient to Justify him in grant
ing her a decree. On her showing that
Dr. Cook had a lucrative practice she was
'granted alimony. After this she lost sight
of her hut-band for a few months, and he
also forgot to pay her the alimony.
Dr. Cook was not anxious to live a
single life. It is little less than a year
since the divorce was granted, and to-day
'he was again called into court, this time
,to explain why he did not pay alimony
!to the first Mrs. Cook. The doctor then
confided to Judge Ellsworth that shortly
after his divorce he made a hurried trip
to Reno and that now ho has another
wife and family to support. And all this
has happened within a year. The first
Mrs. Cook was also in court, but there
were no loving glances cast by her at her
ex-husband when he told of how he had
'evaded the State law by crossing into
Nevada and of how- he had replaced his
first wife by her successor, who was not
in court to-day.
The first Mrs. Cook's attorney argued
that his client was entitled to support,
,but Judge Ellsworth said that he knew of
no precedent for a man being required to
.support a divorced wife when it was

PRESIDENT WM. R. HARPER. I
â¢4-
BERKELEY, March President William R. Harper of the University Â®
of Chicago, one of the most distinguished scholars of the East, is to be ~
ln California during the present' week. He comes to deliver the oration V
at the Charter day exercise, of the University of California, to bo held *Â»
in Berkeley March 23; but his stay will be fully occupied during the brief V
seven days with a veritable round of public receptions and addresses. Both q
tho pulpit and the platform will make demands upon him dally, and the rep- i
resentatlve associations of scholars and clergymen are arranging dates on Â©
which he will be their guest of honor. >
President Harper's visit is somewhat unique in that it is the first occa- V
Eion on which an Eastern college president has crossed the Rockies for the Â«
express purpose of attending the anniversary exercises of California's State h?
University, a.nd collegians are disposed to look upon the event as marking Â©
the closer union which is springing up between the universities of the East -*âº
and West. The subject of his address on Berkeley's Charter day is to be Â©
"Democracy and the University," and in it he Is expected to outline the i
most modern views of the relation between colleges and the masses. . T
President Harper will arrive In Berkeley on the morning of Wednesday, Â©
March 22. On the afternoon of the same day the student body of the unlver- â +
sity has arranged to tender him a public reception, consisting of a military Â©
parade and review on the campus, to be followed by an address in Harmon -+
gymnasium. The latter will be exclusively for members .of. the university. Â©
At half-past 10 Thursday morning the Board of Regents and the professors â +
and associate professors of the faculty will assemble in Harmon gymnasium Â©
to celebrate, with appropriate academic exorcises, the thirty-first annlver- -â¦
sary of the day on which the university first became a corporate body un- Â©
der charter from the State. Here President Harper will deliver the oration -f
which brings him to the Pacific Coast. Â©
The distinguished visitor will also spend a short time at Stanford Unlver- â¦
Elty as the guest of President David Starr Jordan, his last public address be- V
lng delivered in . Oakland next Sunday afternoon. <-_

proved that he had another wife and child
legally dependent upon him. Dr. Cook
said that his income at this time does not
exceed $50 per month, and that $20 of this
Is necessary to maintain a horse and
buggy to keep up his practice.
Judge Ellsworth evidently did not con
sider that $50 a month is too much for a
doctor to keep up an appearance with and
maintain a wife and child, and so he dis
missed the contempt proceedings. In the
meantime the first Mrs. Cook will anx
iously watch for her ex-husband's prac
tice to increase, so that she can make an
other attempt to collect her alimony.
PROVED TO BE A FAILURE.
Married the Same Man Twice and
Now Rejects Him.
OAKLAND, March 20.â After having
twice married the same man, having been
once divorced from him, Mrs. Johanna M.
F. Schmid has finally concluded that
after all marriage is not what it is pro
claimed to be. Accordingly, she has
once more appealed to the Superior Court
to untie the nuptial knot. :; : L; - . ':..
In her complaint for a divorce from
Jacob G. Schmid, filed this afternoon,
Mrs. Schmid charges her husband with
failure to provide and extreme cruelty.
The parties were first married in 189., but
the domestic path proved too thorny, and
in March, 1896, Mrs. Schmid sued for and
secured a divorce. A few months later
the divorced couple kissed and made up
and their marriage was once more sol
emnized. The law prohibiting divorced
people from remarrying or marrying at
all within a year subsequent to a decree
was not then in effect.
The fruit of the marriage was a bright
baby girl, the custody of which the
mother now asks for. The Schmids reside
in Last Oakland.
St. Mary's Students Celebrate.
OAKLAND, March 20.â Last evening
the students of St. Mary's College cele
brated St. Patrick's day by musical and
literary exercises. The college hall was

the exercises were under the auspices of
the Athletic Association of the college.
The following took part: William Eccles.

Realizes His Insanity.
OAKLAND, March 20.â E. Brownine.
a draughtsman, aged 32 years, was com
mitted to Napa Insane Asylum, to-day by
Judge Hall. Browning is of a very mel
ancholy disposition and at times becomes
violent. He realized that his mind is un
balanced and asked the court to commit
him to an asylum, where he might hope
for eventual recovery. He wears his
hair ln long curls, and his face is orna
mented with a unique growth of beard.
Browning states that he adopts this fasn
lon so that his appearance might be in
keeping with his condition. .
An Old Journalist Insane.
OAKLAND, March 20.â Samuel Stevens
Saul, aged 65 years, a pioneer newspaper
man, was examined for insanity to-day
by the Lunacy Commissioners and has
been recommended for committment to
an asylum.
THE SAT* FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 21, 1899.
AN OLD-TIME
RAILROAD MAN
PASSES AWAY
Death of Thomas J.
Carothers.
OAKLAND'S BAGGAGE MASTER
'â¢MOVED TO A NEW HOME" A
MONTH AGO.
Contracted His Fatal Illness by Fi
delity to Dutyâ Proof of Deep
Devotion for His Loved
Daughter. . ;
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 20.
Thomas J. Carothers, known equally
well as "the Southern Pacific baggage
master," and an Oakland politician, died
THOMAS J. CAROTHERS.
at his residence on Harrison street to
day. For twenty-seven years Mr. Car
others has been actively engaged ln busi
ness in this city. In 1872 he came to this
city from Sacramento and entered the
employ of the railroad company. He has
never changed his employment, and was
well known by the thousands of people
who pass through the Southern Pacific
depot.
Soon after his arrival Mr. Carothers
took a prominent part in the politics of
Oakland. He was elected to the City
Council from the First Ward several
years ago, and gave such satisfaction to
his constituents that they returned him
a second and third time. When M. C.
Chapman was Mayor he appointed Mr.
Carothers a member of the Board of Pub
lic Works. At that time the board ex
ercised more power than any other
branch of the city government, having
full power to distribute all the patronage
In the Police. Fire and Street depart-,
ments.
The deceased affiliated with several fra
ternal societies, being a member of Har
bor Lodge, 1. O. O. F. ; Occidental Lodge,
A. O. U. W., and Golden Gate Lodge,
Knights of Honor, in each of which he
held Important positions.
Mr. Carothers attributed the origin of
his fatal illness to the amount of work he
was called upon to perform at the Na
tional Christian Endeavor Convention.
The blockade of travel and baggage on
that occasion fell heavily on his depart
ment, and he was required to go for three
days without a minute's rest. This pro
duced complications which ultimately re
sulted in death. Sixty-two years ago Mr.
Carothers was born at Washington, D.
C. He came I . California with his broth
er in 1855, both having received appoint
ments as mall agents for the Government.
After arriving in this State the brothers
resigned their Government appointments
and went into business in Sacramento
upon a large scale. They acquired valua
ble property just outside the capital city,
which they still own.
The funeral will take place Wednesday
afternoon. During his lifetime Mr. Car
others frequently requested that there be
no religous services at the house, and that
the ceremonies be as simple as possible.
His wishes will be carried out, even to
the extent of not. permitting friends to
send the customary floral tributes. The
deceased leaves a widow, but their only
child died several years ago.
A few weeks ago Mr. Carothers moved
Into his new home. There is one room in
it that was of special interest to him. It
was the room that would have been occu
pied by his only daughter. Lillian, had she
lived. The plans were made before her
death and "-"** parents declined to alter
them. The girl's room was furnished just
as though she were living, and such fur
niture, bric-a-brac and other things as she
had prized were retained as a memorial
of an only child.
Mrs. Baven's Strange Death.
OAKLAND, March 20.â Dr. R. T. Strat
ton will conduct an autopsy to-morrow on
the body of Mrs. Iva Raven, who died at
the Receiving Hospital to-day under
rather peculiar, circumstances. Mrs. Ra
ven was a domestic in the employ of R
M. Clement, . City Engineer-elect, and
yesterday morning she complained of
pains In her stomach. She was taken to
the Receiving Hospital and shortly after
arriving there became unconscious and
remained in that state until the end,
which came this morniing.
The physicians at the hospital were un
able to ascertain the nature of the
woman's illness or the cause of death
Coroner Mehrmann will also hold an In
quest to-morrow night. Mrs. Raven was
with her husband last Saturday night
and he has been subpenaed to attend me
Inquest. Deceased was a native of Nor
way, aged 41 years.

OAKLAND, March 20.â A missionary
mass-meeting will be held at Asbury
Methodist Church (South) to-morrow
from 9:30 a. m. until 4:30 p. m. An inter
esting programme has been arranged, and
Drs. Hannon and Knight are to partici

LOWER WATER
RATES FIXED
FOR OAKLAND
Council Passes the
New Ordinance.
WAKEFIELD MAY BE UNSEATED
WAS NOT NATURALIZED IN
TIME TO HOLD OFFICE.
In Conflict With the Provisions of
the City Canvassing
the Returns of the Re
cent Election.
OAKLAND, March 20.â The City Coun
cil passed the Upton water-rate ordinance
to-night with only two dissenting votes.
This ends the water-rate business for this
year. The schedule, which will go into
effect July 1, places the rates about mid
way between those passed last year and
the Manuel ordinance passed four years
ago. It was based on the investigation
made by the. minority of the Council and
is slightly higher than the ordinance pre
sented by Councilman Earl, who Is a
member of the Fire and Water Commit
tee. The only votes against it were those
of Earl and Brosnahan. Not for several
years has the water rate matter been dis
posed of so smoothly.
The Council commenced to-night to
canvass the returns of the late election.
When the official returns are made it is
possible that Dr. W. F. B. Wakefield will
not be permitted to take his seat. The
great register shows that W. F. B. Wake
field, a native of Canada, was on July 30,
i*-:<-.. naturalized, and that on the same
day he was registered. The city charter
says, "The Mayor, members of the Coun
cil, Auditor, Treasurer, City Attorney,
Police Judge, Commissioners of Public
Works, School Directors, members of the
Board of Health and Health Officer must
each at the time of the election or ap
pointment have been a citizen of the
United States and a resident and qualified
elector of the city for three years next
preceding their election or appointment."
The Board of Education will fill the va
cancy when It occurs, but not until the
canvass is complete can any action be
taken. i__3&
The canvass proceeded till a third of the
returns were gone over. All the leading
candidates had representatives , present,
but there were no changes from the un
official returns already published. The
canvass will be resumed at 7:30 o'clock
Tuesday night. '
ROETH'S HIGH WATER
RATE IS ADOPTED
MITCHELL'S OBDINANCE BE
JECTED.
Supervisors Fix a Schedule for Out
side Consumers for the Next
Fiscal Year.
.Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 20.
The water rates for all of this county
outside of incorporated towns were fixed
by the Supervisors to-day. For many
weeks the matter has been under discus
sion and this morning two ordinances
were before the board. One was intro
duced by Supervisor Roeth; the other by
Supervisor Mitchell. Roeth's ordinance
is about, 25 per cent higher than Mit
chell's. For the smallest of houses Roeth
would charge 45 cents, and Mitchell 25
cents, and this graded until a large four
story house Is. reached, when Mitchell
would charge $2 60 and Roeth $3 15.
The rates for extras, such as lawns, ani
mals and other uses to which water ls
put, are in the same proportion. When
the ordinances were read Mr. Roeth
stated that his figures were based upon
the rates now In use, with the exception'
of an increase of 25 per cent for water for
sprinkling purposes.
Mr. Mitchell said he thought existing
rates were too high, and defended his or
dinance on the ground that his rates were
just and equitable. Mitchell's ordinance
was voted on first and was defeated, the
vote standing: For the ordinance, Mit
chell and Talcott; against. Church and
Roeth, while Wells was excused.
The Roeth ordinance was then taken' up
and passed by the votes of Church, Roeth
and Wells. Mitchell and Talcott voted
against it. The new rates go into effect
i July 1.

BLACKSTOCK GIVES UP
TO SOUTHERN PACIFIC
Advises Abandonment of All Liti
gation and All Efforts to Se
cure Rate Reductions.
â 'â .'â 'â¢' . â *
Bis Colleagues Decline to Act on His Resolution and
Ask for Time to Consider Bis Extraordinary
Proposition.
I am unqualifiedly of the opinion that the continuance of this
litigation is not in the interest of the people of the State, and that
it is the duty of this board, so far as it has the power, to terminate
this litigation, so that it may free its hands and save further ex
pense to the State. ... I find it to be in the power of this
commission, without the consent of the railroad company, to ter
minate this litigation by repeal and rescindment of the whole resolu
tion, covering the 8 per cent grain rate reduction as well as the
25 per cent general horizontal reduction.-- Excerpt from report
of Railroad Commissioner Blackstock.
IT was in the above quoted words that
Railroad Commissioner Blackstock, at
the meeting of the Railroad Commis
sion, yesterday, proposed to surrender
to the ' Southern Pacific Company the
fruits of three years of expensive litiga
tion undertaken in behalf of the farmers,
merchants and shippers of this State.
This language was part of the report he
submitted to his colleagues, and Its sub
stance was subsequently embodied in a
formal resolution, action on which was
deferred until to-day.
If this resolution is adopted it will give
to the railroad corporation even more
than it had the audacity to ask in its
overtures for a compromise with the pre
decessors of the present commission.
H. M. La Rue, the chairman of the for
mer board, stated, and his assertion has
not been contradicted, that an offer was
made to him on behalf of the Southern
Pacific by W. H. Mills to settle the pend
ing controversy on the following terms:
Tho Southern Pacific Company would put
into effect the 8 per cent reduction on
grain rates, and would dismiss its suit
restraining the action of the Railroad
Commission, if the latter would agree to
forego any action on the 25 per cent gen
eral horizontal reduction resolution.
It is claimed that the railroad made this
proposition in order to escape the ordeal i
of having its books and papers brought
into court and its affairs and business
methods thrown open to the public, as
would be the case If the litigation were
pressed to a conclusion in the courts.
Those familiar with the situation hold
that such a ventilation arid investigation
would probably result in demonstrating
that the commission would be justified in
making radical rate reductions all along
the line, and that it is this danger which
the Southern Pacific has been desperately
seeking to avoid for the past three years.
By the resolution of Commissioner
Blackstock the terms of this proposed
compromise are not only accepted but the
corporation is exempted from the effects j
of the 8 per cent reduction in grain rates
throughout the State.
The reason assigned by Commissioner
Blackstock for his extraordinary resolu
tion is that to continue the litigation
would be a mtter of great expense to the
â¢ people, while the saving to the grain
shippers would not exceed $30,000 a year.
Commissioner Blackstock had been ap
pointed a committee of one to investigate
the pending litigation regarding the 8 per
cent reduction of grain rates and the pro
posed 25 per cent reduction * of general
freight rates ordered by the last Board.
lie submitted his report yesterday. After
a complete review of the present status
of the case he presented his resolution
providing for the abandonment of the liti
gation and requested that immediate ac
tion be taken upon it.
Commissioner Laumeister, while ex
pressing himself in favor of the resclnd
ment of the 25 per cent general horizontal
reduction, was opposed to the repeal of
the resolution passed by ' the previous
board inasmuch as it related to the 8 per
cent reduction on grain rates. He asked
for a postponement of its consideration.
Commissioner Edson expressed himself
In a similar strain, and thought that time
should be allowed himself and his col
league to consider the report of Mr.
Blackstock In. all Its essential points. The
latter rather unwillingly agreed to * the
postponement, and his argument in favor
of his recommendation will be heard this
afternoon.
The report in part is as follows:
So far as this case is concerned, it appears
that the only material question presented ls as
to whether or not the 8 per cent grain rate
schedule, promulgated by the commission is
fair, Jurt and reasonable. It Is a matter of
common knowledge, and undoubtedly the* fact.

Thousands of women fail of this for one
great prevalent reason. While they resort
to every device to preserve their beauty of
complexion by external applications and
possibly take the best care of their general
health, they are too frequently utterly neg-
lectful of their health in a special womanly
way. No woman can remain beautiful, at-
tractive or amiable, who suffers from weak-
ness and disease of the delicate and import
ant feminine organism. A woman who
suffers in this way will lose her clearness
of complexion, her eyes will become dull,
worry and pain will mark her face with
wrinkles and she will become nervous,
sickly, fretful and despondent. There is a
sovereign remedy for all troubles of this
description. It is Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription. ;> *
" Mv illness was causr/d by lack of medical at-
tention d'uriug childbirth. It lasted for a period
of three years, during which my suffering was
almost indescribable,'' writes Mrs. Edith Petty,
of Tcxanna, Cherokee Nat., Ind. Ter. " Owing
to the injuries receivedâ rupture, internal dis-
placement, etc.. I became a physical wreck. I
was in a constant state of pain and nervous col-
lapse. I became so nervous. I feared insanity.
My heart was affected and I had spells of palpi-
tation and smothering. Was reduced in strength
and could take no solid food. The doctors told
me that recovery was impossible without a sur-
gical operation. * My monthly periods ceased en-
tirely. My mother bought a bottle of Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription. I took twelve bottles.
Thanks to an All-wise Providence and Doctor
Pierces medicines, the symptoms have all dis-
appeared. I can now do a hard day's work, eat
anything and everything I wish. I regard my
recovery as permanent, for it is nearly two years
aiacc I stopped taking Dr. Pierces medicines."
that the Southern Pad flo Company, In order
to meet the comr>etltlon of the Valley road,
has reduced its rates In the territory affected
by that competition, so that the same are now,
and have been for some time, as low or even
lower than the rates prescribed by the 8 per
cent grain schedule of the commission; also
that reductions have been made by the South
ern Pacific Company in the Sacramento Valley
so that at the present time the difference be
tween the rates actually enforced by the rail
road company and the rates proposed by the
S per cent grain rate schedule Is very small,
such difference, in all probability, not affect
ing the revenue of the company to an extent
exceeding $30,000 per annum. Certainly, as the
case now stands, the substantial pecuniary
matters In Issue are slight, and the question is
whether a decision of these matters in favor
of the State will Justify the great expense and
delay which must be incurred in order to reach
a final decision. â¢ â¢
I am advised by the Attorney General, and by
counsel retained the Attorney by our prede
sel retained ln this case by our prede
cessors, that it will require enormous labor and
a very wide range of Investigation of expert
witnesses and the expenditure of not less than
$30,000 to prepare the case for submission by
the respondents to the Circuit Court for de
cision; that it will take years to 'try Itâ
counsel stating that It will require possibly
five or six years, another one that it will take
not less than four years to take the case
through the Supreme Court of the United
States, where It would Inevitably be taken
should it be pushed to final Judgment. I am
further advised, as appears by the records and
by the report of the Attorney General to the
Assembly, that up to the present time there
has been paid and incurred in counsel fees and
expenses in this case more than $43,000, the
counsel fees alone amounting to more than
$33,000, and It further appears from like sources
that the future costs and expenses of this liti
gation will be at least $67.000. $30,000 of which
will bo required as fees for experts and $30,000
as fees for special counsel. Should we press the
case with diligence, in my own opinion It would
require at least the remainder of the terms of
office of the present commission to bring It to
a final conclusion, and during all this time the
hands of the commission would be bo tied that
it -practically could not investigate or make
any reduction or changes in the rates now en
forced. It seems to me that, even If we could
be assured of a final judgment ln this case,
the expenditure of time and money necessary
to accomplish this end would not be Justified,
even to reach such a result; on the contrary,
it seems clear that the people are Interested
far more In securing actual reductions of rates
whenever the same may be' had, rather than
that they should bear the heavy burdens of this
litigation, even to secure a. favorable decision,
which, as I have shown, would accomplish very
little for the actual benefit of the people.
"While not desiring to criticize the acts of our
predecessors, It is evident that a serious mis
take was made in adopting the so-called 25
per cent freight rate resolution. Had the com
mission confined its official action to the pro
mulgation of rates actually determined upon. It
is not likely that any litigation would have
resulted, ln which case the people would have
secured at once the benefits of the reductions
made and would not have been- called upon to
bear the expenses of this litigation, the out
come of which ls exceedingly uncertain at best.
It 16 the duty of the commission to secure, so
far as It can legally, reductions In rates of
transportation, and It ls evident that no such
result can be accomplished by any general hor
izontal reduction of the rates maintained by
the company: on the contrary,- the only practi
cal method of securing any reduction Is to In
vestigate each class of rates and to remove
such discriminations as may be found, and to
reduce apy particular rates or classes of rates
which may be found exorbitant to the basis
of a reasonable and fair rate. ' When this ls
done It Is certain that' the company will not
have . the advantages which it has secured In
the present litigation, growing out of the par
ticular form of the resolution adopted by the
board.
In view of these undoubted conditions exist
ing at this date and of the results which are
certain to accrue in the future, is It our - duty,
representing the State and exercising sound
discretion as the agents of the State, to make
the extraordinary expenditure, without com
pensatory results, which undoubtedly will be
required ln the future prosecution of this case?
I am unqualifiedly of the opinion that the con
tinuance of this litigation is. not in the Interest
of the people of the State, and that is the
duty of this board, so far as It has the power,
to terminate this litigation so that It may free
its hands and save further expense to the State
and thereafter proceed by regular methods to
secure such advantages as may be had for the
benefit of the shippers of freight.
' I find It to be in the power of this com
mission, without the consent of the railroad
company, to terminate this litigation by re
peal, and rescindment of the whole resolution
covering the 8 per cent grain rate, reduction as
well as the 25 per cent- general horizontal re
duction. By the rescindment and repeal of this
resolution the entire basis of the suit is re
moved and the case must fall, and with it the
Injunction against this commission, thus leav
ing the commission free to adopt rates based
upon present conditions, and to adjust. Is pos
sible, the â¢ numerous complaints constantly
coming before the board 'of discriminations in
freight and passenger charges. This, to my
mind, manifestly is the only proper course to
pursue, so that the hands of the commission
may be untied and It can for itself take the
responsibility of putting Into effect the con
stitutional and statutory' provisions of the State
as Judge McKerina has most clearly defined
them to exist.
In pursuance of the conclusions reached by
me and stated in the foregoing report, I have

nished by the railroads 'In â¢ this - State,
whereby they, suffered .considerable, dam
age, and praying. for relief:
"The undersigned cattle shippers and
dealers desire to 'call attention to. the fact
that we are dissatisfied with the charac
ter of the service rendered by the rail
road companies in this State in the matter
of cattle shipments. "Service is unsatis
factory, particularly with regard to the
failure of the companies to. run stock
trains on schedule time and to handle
livestock with proper care. Trains j are
often many hours behind schedule time,
and we are compelled to keep our cattle
standing in cars waiting to be coupled
with the trains when they arrive, i This
causes appreciable shrinkage, in the
weight and the bruising of the cattle and
consequent loss to us. It also compels our.
men to stand around guard at the cor
rals at unreasonable hours and incapaci
tates them from performing their usual
duties. We also desire to complain of
the carelessness of the companies while
coupling cattle cars, which are thrown to

much needless suffering to the stock." -:

Grain Rate 1 Reductions Would Be of
Vast Eenefit to Them.
SACRAMENTO, March 20.â Ex-Railroad
Commissioner La Rue stated this even
ing, when his attention was called to the
report of Commissioner Blackstock to the
effect that it .would not pay to continue
the suits against the railroad company as
a matter of economy, that this assertion
was not substantiated by the actual fig
ures of freight rates which were on. file
with the Railroad Commission. When
these figures were obtained it was shown
that in the matter of shipping 'grain to
tide water the farmers would save by the
reduction about $160,000 annually.
Mr. La Rue added that when the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road established its freight rates it took
as a basis the rates decided upon by the
Railroad Commission as a fair charge,
and the Southern Pacific has conformed
to the new conditions in the San Joaquin
Valley, the great grain growing section,
so that in some instances it is charging
even less than the figures to which the
commission sought to limit it. The 8 per
cent reduction in grain rates was flrst
proposed by Commissioner La Rue.
Mr. La Rue said further that he had
deemed it impracticable to enforce a 25
per cent horizontal reduction on general
freight rates, and had looked with favor
on a request* from W. 11. Mills for the

Her Great Loss Brought on Hysteria

She Will Soon Recover
Mental Balance.
While suffering from hysteria, the re
sult of poignant grief over the recent
death of her husband, Mrs. Dr. Frederick
P. Muffe made what was happily an un
successful attempt at suicide yesterday.
Ever since the sudden and untimely de
mise of Dr. Muffe his widow has been
half-crazed with sorrow, and as the days
go by she seems to feel her loss more
keenly. Her daughters have done every
thing in the power of loving children to
console their heart-broken mother, being
deeply concerned for her physical and
mental health, but until, yesterday they
had no suspicion that she ever thought
of ending her sufferings by suicide.
Late yesterday afternoon the report of
a pistol startled the inmates of the Muffe.
home at 1211 Jackson street, and as it
came from the room occupied by the be
reaved widow it created consternation and
gave her daughter Agnes a horrifying
shock. Mrs. Muffe had secured -possession
of a pistol and vainly attempted to shoot
herself, but in her nervous, hysterical con
dition she pulled tho trigger before the
muzzle was pointed in her direction and
the bullet was imbedded in the wall. She
did not attempt to lire a second shot.
Kindly hands led her to her chamber and
she was lovingly soothed and persuaded
to retire. A doctor was called and pre
scribed a sleeping potion, and last even
ing the patient was resting quietly.
Mrs. Muffe- nervous system Is com
pletely shattered, yet her family hope her
recovery will be speedy and comDlete.
The numerous friends of the late doctor,
who is remembered for his many acts of
kindness, join with the family in their
sorrow and express thankfulness that his
.widow escaped the bullet fired by her own
hand while she was grief-crazed.
'Dr. Muffe died on the morning of March
10 of heart disease. He was seized with a
paroxysm, and while his wife was prepar
ing a remedy to relieve his agony he ex
pired. The shock, followed by the sad in
cidents of the funeral; was too great, and
the unhappy widow has been suffering
â from melancholia and despondency ever
since. Her two daughters are Mrs. H.
Baum of Fort Bragg and Miss Agnes Jes
sie Muffe. â 
TWO BANKS WILL
RESUME BUSINESSS
APPLICATIONS MADE TO THE

Assets of the Institutions Greatly
Enhanced in Value by the
Southern Rains.
.Two of the four banks that suspended
payment in San Uuis Obispo County last
week have felt- the result of the recent
copious and opportune rains. Communi
cations were received by the Bank Com
mission yesterday from the officers of the
Commercial Bank of San Luis Obispo and
of the Citizens' Bank of Paso Robles,
stating that owing to the enhancement in
value of the real estate held by them,
caused by the storm, they were prepare
to resume business.
In the case of the Commercial Bank the
commission was informed that the stock
holders were ready to contribute an ad
ditional $50,000 to the capital of the insti
tution and that most of the depositors
had agreed not to make withdrawals for
certain stipulated peri ds, varying from
three to nine months.
The stockholders of the Citizens' Bank
have arranged to pay in .$15,000 cash and
the depositors have made concessions
which will prevent, anything like a run
on the bank. .
There will be a meeting of all the mem
bers of the commission to-day to act on
the applications of the institutions to re
sume business, and it is believed that
they will be permitted to do so.

SIGNIFICANCE TO CALIFORNIA
OF IMPORTANT EVENTS.
Able Speakers Discuss the Prospects
of the Countries and Islands
of the Pacific From States
men's Standpoint.
â 
Enjoyable social Intercourse and discus
sion of topics of public importance were
in order hist evening at the meeting or
the Unitarian Club of California winch
was held in the rooms of the Merchants
Club. About 100 members of the club and
guests were in attendance. They assem
bled at 6 o'clock and spent over an hour
in discussing dinner. At the close of the
feast the club listened to a discussion or
the significant events that have recently
been crowding upon one another in the
Pacific Ocean, by speakers capable of dis
cussing them. The trend of the speeches
showed the paramount importance to
California of the changes that have oc
curred. President Sheldon G. Kellogg
presided over the meeting and introduced
the speakers. 'â¢-;'-â  J _Â» .. ,
Eli T. Sheppard, for many years united
States Consul in China, was the first
speaker. His subject was the recent de
velopments In China and Russian prog
ress in the Orient. â¢ His remarks were
concise and to the point. He referred to
the fact that -as a result of the recent
war America is of necessity materially in
terested in the trade of the Pacific Ocean,
and in consequence this means a great fu
ture for the Pacific Coast and San _ ran
cisco in particular. Speaking of the na
tional influences now at work, which are
slowly dismembering China. Mr. Sheppard
said that the probable effect upon the
trade of America is a question that re
quires the most careful and matured con
sideration. China, he said, was now In
a vortex of international struggles.
France and Russia represent the policy
of territorial acquisition by spoilization,
while England and America stand for the
integrity of China. Of all the. agencies
at work in Asia there are none equal to
Russia. Her designs and policy cannot
be comprehended,* because they have
never been frankly avowed. Russia
love of conquest is solely her excuse for
such gigantic Asiatic dominion as she
now possesses. The results of the Span
ish War, which gives to this country the
Philippines, necessitate that America
shall have some definite polio* in China.
In the future, Mr. Sheppard declared, our
policy must be a firm one, as it is the
duty of this country to protect her own
trade interests in China and not trust to
England to do so, as has been the case.
The speaker said in his opinion America
and England must combine to protect
their natural rights. He showed. the
many advantages that would result as a
consequence of this co-operation.
C Count liirokichi Mutsu, the Japanese
Consul was next introduced by President
Kellogg. He dwelt on the future of the
Pacific and in substance said that one of
the most interesting subjects was a Study
of the trade between America and Japan
The latter country is the second greatest
buyer of American exports. Of all the im
ports at least one-fourth come from
Sa pan. which fact shows the close trade
relation of the two countries. After the
war with China. Japan's energies were
turned toward development and expan
sion and various business enterprises
sprang up all over the empire. The ag
gressive future of the empire is shown by
the Increase in the Japanese navy. The
empire of the rising sun is awake to the
situation in the Pacific., it realizes
that the future of the Philippines and the
Hawaiian group must go hand in- hand.
He predicted continued pleasant re
lations between Japan and America. â 
Professor Bernard. Moses of the Uni
versity of California treated the future of
the Pacific Ocean from the standpoint of
a historian. One of his remarks was most
significant and striking. He said as the
American nation had advanced from the
east to the west it. had met new condi
tions and achieved successful results on
new soil. The nation to-day is as full of
aggressive expansion as it ever was. If
the nation increases in the future as it
has done in the past it must of necessity
overrun the boundary of the United
States, and that the outlook is toward the
islands In and beyond the Pacific. Pro
fessor Moses clearly showed by concise
logic that all of the new questions arising
for solution at the hands of this Govern
ment are capable of solution, and that
what America immediately needs and
must have is diplomats, who must pos
sess business as well as -diplomatic knowl
edge. The many questions of climate,
labor and government in our new posses
sions are capable of solution, and will not
be hard to adjust. Professor Moses was
loudly' applauded at the conclusion "of his
remarks. -:_* . _. . * â,_.,,
Hon. W. R. Castle of Honolulu followed.
His remarks were entirely relative to the
islands, of which he is a native. He said
Hawaii was fitted to take its place as the
part- of a great civilized nation. To.-day
the islands, declared the speaker, are as
much American soil as any one of the
States of this Union. He showed that
financially, socially and otherwise Hawaii
was worthy to take place as a part of the
United States. " :- *
Captain Henry Glass, formerly of the
Charleston, also made a few remarks on
his personal observations of the islands.

a prominent Park-street business man,
was arrested late this afternoon on com
plaint of . P. A. Kennedy, a former em
ploye. Macra.te at once furnished bonds
for his release. Kennedy claims that
Macrate disturbed his peace and made
threats against his life. The two men
met last Thursday in front of the home of
Mrs. J. E. Jackson, 2105 San Jose avenue,
and what followed probaDly will not be
learned until it is exploited in court.

Patrick White, 320. 1vy avenue, was in
his brother's house St. Patrick's day
when a quarrel started between his broth

White seized a poker and laid him out.
Patrick had his sister-in-law arrested on
a charge of battery and the case was
called before acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday. The sister-in-law. Mrs. Kitty
White, told the Judge that Patrick had no
right to "chip in," and as Patrick refused
to prosecute the rase was dismissed.
The Charge Denied.
