TULARE'S STATESMAN, TOO, MUST
FACE MOST SERIOUS CHARGES
CHAIRMAN COSPER
GETS CAUGHT IN
THE DRAGNET
Accused of Having Solicited a Large Sum
for His Vote.
SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS WANTED
falter R. Bacon, Grant's Attorney, Threw the Shell Into the
Camp That Created the Consternation of the
Investigators.
: ; Â;.^ALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
; .^fENTO. Jan. 19.â The sensation of the
I ;'â¢: -.'jdiiry- before the Assembly Investigating
. Committee was a charge made by Wal-
' ter R. Bacon, attorney and political
â¢ : friend of U. S. Grant, against Assem
blyman E. T. Cosper, chairman of the
committee.
While no direct charge was made by
Mr. Bacon, yet the statement made by
him before the investigating commit
â  tee.'this afternoon was in the nature of
,i an accusation and will be considered as
i.such until the facts are made plain by
.: competent witnesses. As the accusa
;; â¢ tion stands Cosper is charged with
'.'.' having solicited the payment to himself
â¢ jof -16000 |n return, for his. vote for Grant
for United States Senator. The wit
, .ness, who, it is alleged, is conversant
. .with all the facts and who, so the story
goes, acted as Copper's agent, Is C. G.
.I,;in:herson. an attorney residing in
'." --VJsalia. A subpena has been Issued
â¢ â¢ for him at the request of Mr. Bacon
â¢â '.â  and as soon as it can be served Mr.
.I-amberson will be taken before the
;' committee and asked to testify under
. bath to all the facts within his knowl
edge.
A few minutes prior to the moment
-..selected by Mr. Bacon for making the
"(charge Mr. Cosper was on tht- witness
Stand and there testified that he had
never at any time asked or received re
. muneration for his vote in the Legis
. lature, nor had any Senatorial candi
' date made any improper offer to him.
When the proceedings before the in
.-â¢ vestigating committee closed last night
â¢: Milton J. Green was formally notified
; "; to appear before the bar of the Assem
:' bly this morning and show cause why
".he. should not be punished for contempt
â â¢; ytpt- refusing to answer questions relat
. Ing to the payment of money by him
â oh behalf of Grant to secure the elec
';â  tion of certain legislators in the various
';â¢ districts of the State. Providence and
S the inability of the official stenographer
â  to arrive on time with a proper trans
-..; cript of the record Intervened to save
; â  :' Green from a humiliating backdown or
-;; 4 ."prison cell. From the fact that
â ; .Green's attorney has been busy to-day
i spreading vague reports of the possi
f \4iility of his client's willingness to
i, vi^ijswer the question in a moderated
I form, taken in connection with hints
: f;f.b.m several of the committeemen that
they do not feel disposed to deal harsh
r ly with the recalcitrant witness makes
. .possible the belief that Green will not
;.â ' jne-'-*ent to Jail and that he will not be
required to answer questions that have
b/eri put to him. Now that Colonel
1 Burns and his army of political shys
; ;.fera.-, ; have reached the conclusion that
t.h.r present scandal has put a final end
â ^ to. Grant's Senatorial ambition they do
Vnot. feel disposed to punish Green to
the extent of forcing him to divulge the
â  secret methods by which they them
: Fflvos are seeking to force their can
â > dldate into high office against the
;:' : â  â¢wi"fihÂ«s^_pf the people of the State. It
} -frlU not do to allow the dear public to
;' look -behind the veil, because if this
I were done a hanging bee might be the
.â -result.
>. .It is a noticeable fact that the inves
â  tigating committee, which declares lt
::.f< bent on delving to the bottom of
.'â¢things, criminally neglected to ask
i; Green the name of the prominent per- '
'â "son who told him that Howard E. '
j fright was going to make application '
â¢ to D. M. ; Burns for a cash contribu
tion to his (Wright's) campaign ex- j
â¢ p.enses. It is to be presumed from the !
.': evidence that Gre^-n. when he learned the !
facts from the "prominent citizen," in- \
. tercepted Wright and informed him i
-â¢that he was welcome to help himself '
"from.t he Grant Senatorial sack, pro
.; vlded he would promise to vote for \
t?nih.t.for Senator. The committee has j
seen, fit to leave this point In the dark, j
The San Francisco Call.
possibly with the purpose !n view of
shielding the "prominent citizen."
The mention of Wright's name re
calls the fact that he cut but small
figure in to-day's proceedings before
the investigating commltte. It would
seem that the members of the commit
tee have cast him out on their mental
garbage heaps, there to remain until
such a time as will seem proper for
them to haul him off to the garbage
crematory, there to be incinerated by
the contemptuous votes of his former
legislative associates. Such a fate will
be the proper and perfect ending of a
career of criminality so well begun.
Hugh M. Burke, a member of the
legislative staff of The Call, was the
only witness examined to-day whose
testimony touched on the misdeeds of
which Wright has been convicted in
the estimation of all honeÃt men. Mr.
Burke interviewed both Wright and
Green prior to the publication of the
charges against the Speaker. Both
men In their statements to the witness
made practically the same admissions
as were made to the manager of The
Call, and upon which the original
charge was based. W'right's denials,
admissions and evasions were indica
tive of his guilt even then, and his
statements since, made clear by direct
and circumstantial evidence of the
most convincing character, show his
fear of the exposure then impending.
Another member of The Call's legis
lative staff was the nextÂ»wltness called.
He related to the committee the facts
concerning the Issuance of passes by
William F. Herrin to Assemblyman A.
H. Merrill of San Francisco at the so
licitation of D. M. Burns. The witness
then related the substance of informa
tion that had come to him and which
in effect was that Assemblyman Cos-
per, chairman of the committee, had
either in person ot through an agent
sought an interview with Milton J.
Green, and had told Green that he
(Cosper) had been offered $6000 to vote
for D. M. Burns for Senator; that Cos
per had said that he did not want to
vote fcr Burns, but preferred to vote
for Grant; that if he did vote for Grant
he thought it nothing more than fair
that Grant should recompense him for
having refused the offer made by
Burns. When the witness was ex
cused Mr. Cosper took the stand to
deny that he had ever made or caused
to be made such a proposition to Mr.
Green or any one else, and also that
he had never been offered ?6000 or any
sum to vote for Burns.
During the course of Cospor's testi
mony it was brought out that he had
been shown a paper containing or pur
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1899.
WRIGHT'S DEGRADATION
PROVED BY HIMSELF
After Howard E. Wright, Speaker of trje Assembly, cast his first
vote for D. M. Burns he caused to be published his alleged reasoQS
for doing so. One of the reasons he advanced was that Y>e had it
from the best authority that four members of the Supreme Court
were advocating Burns' election. b[e added that the last person
with whon) he discussed trje Senatorial situation was a member of
tbe Supreme Court, and th;at this conversation occurred a few hours
before r;e voted for Burns.
Every n)err)ber of tr;e Supreme Court has been interviewed and
all declare tr;at they r;ave never talKed to Wright on trje Senatorial'
question, and tJ)at t^ey never have in any manner sought to influ
ence tys vote.
Whjen he became a candidate for SpeaKer of tbe Assembly Wright
n>ade tbe solemn declaration tbat he was UQder no obligations to
any corporation or individual. At that tin>e he bad just completed
the expenditure of $900 given him by U. S. Grant through; Milton J.
Green. Ttys n)oney was given bin) under an understanding that be
woulÂ£ support Grant for Senator.
Wrigbt betrayed his constituents by voting for Burns. For this
he was denounced by the voters of his district.
The Call cbarged Wright witb having accepted $1650 fron) U. S.
Grant, througb his political manager, Milton J. Green, in return for a
prort)ise to support Grant for Senator. Wright testifies under oatb
tbat be did receive tbe money from Green, and that be did pledge
bimself to vote for Grant.
When the cbarges against Y)\m were first made Wright made
public a statement tbat the only money he received from Green
was $750. He now swears to the receipt of $1650, the aroount
named in the original cbarges made by Tbe Call.
In a published statement Wright denied that he had ever paid a
cent to W. B. Pringle, as alleged in the cbarges made against him.
He now swears that be paid Pringle $250.
porting 1 to contain a list of names of
legislators who had signed the paper
as a written pledge that they would
vote for Grant so long as he hnd a
chance of being elected United States
Senator. Mr. Cosper thought there
were about a dozen names signed to
the paper, but he could not remember
any of them. During the course iÂ»f the
investigation Cosper has been most dil
igent in trying to get from witnesses
the admission that they had seen such
a list as he described to-day. Ilia tes
timony on this subject caused a rippie
of surprise.
It was when Mr. Cosper stepped
down from the witness stand that the
real surprise of the day was sprung.
Attorney Bacon then asked permission
to. address the committee. When it
was granted he said he requested the
attendance of certain witnesses who
would prove or disprove the charge
that a certain Assemblyman was of
fered a bribe by one Senatorial candi
date and sought a bribe at the hands
of another.
When pressed for particulars Mr.
Bacon said that he was in possession
of information that led him to believe
that C. G. Lamberson of Visalia was
sent to Sacramento by Assemblyman
Cosper to make a proposition to Milton
Green. This proposition was, he sak ..
that Mr. Cosper had been offered the
sum of $6000 by D. M. Burns or some
one acting for him to vote f:>r Burns
for Senator; that Cosper did not want
to vote for Burns, but preferred to vote
for Grant; that if he did vote for Grant
he wished to be remembered in a way
that would compensate him for refus
ing to accept the offer made by Burns.
No comment was indulged In regard
ing this statement, but without dis
cussion the subpena for Mr. Lamberson
was Issued.
By vote of the committee aubpenas
were ordered issued to secure the at
tendance of Jojhn D. Spreckels, pro
prietor of The Call, M. H. de Young,
proprietor of the Chronicle and William
F. Herrln.
Mr. Spreckels' presence Is desired
that he may testify as to whether or
not he has ever seen a list of those leg
islators who have pledged themselves
to vote for Grant. This is the trouble
some list that Chairman Cosper has
been searching for and which he seems
to have had the exclusive privilege of
scanning.
Mr. de Young and Mr. Herrin will be
asked to tell anything they may know
about "Wright's alleged application to
Herrln for $1200 with which to make the
fight in his district. Committeeman
Mellick gave notice that he would
move to reconsider the vote by which
the subpenas were ordered issued,
and the matter was thus left in abey
ance.
Yesterday Assemblyman Anderson
related to the committee the details of
a cash offer made to him by Milton
Green. Anderson refused the offer.
Green also testified in his own defense
concerning this particular transaction.
He acknowledged having made the of
fer of cash to Anderson and that the
offer was refused. He said, however,
that Anderson had promised to keep a
memorandum of the money he spent in
his campaign and if, after the election.
Green wished to stand a portion of the
REPREHENSIBLE USE
OF THE PARTY HEAD
QUARTERS FOR BURNS
Every Effort Being Made by Central Commit
tee Members in His Behalf.
THE "ORGANIZATION" USED AS A CLUB
A Special Attempt Is Now Being Pat Forward to Bring
About a Caucus in tbe Hope of Whipping
Members Into Line.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19.â The despondency in
the fold of D. M. Burns remains un
broken. The two ballots in joint as
sembly to-day brought to the "colonel"
no signs of reinforcements. The touts
hold fast to the hopes of a caucus, see
ing in the secret conclave the only
chance of winning out.
It Is said to-night that a special effort
wi'l be put forward to secure caucus
agreement. Republicans at home as
well as the fearless and untrammeled
representatives in the Legislature
should be on their guard against the
adroit scheme for secret balloting
which the caucus system recognizes.
The plan is to obtain letters and per
sonal requests from Republicans in
every county of the State urging the
Republican Senators and Assemblymen
to sink their personad preferences and
for the sake of harmony in the party
come to an agreement. The argument
to be advanced is that prolongation of
the contest will intensify the bitterness
of factional strife within the party.
Burns cannot win out In an open
fight. The supporters of Grant will not
support him and he cannot take away
from General Barnes and R. N. Bulla
the members who comprise their fol
lowing. In a case of extreme necessity
two Democratic Senators might be
brought into the colonel's fold, but the
recruits from the opposition cut a small
figure in the calculations of the colonel.
He is so thoroughly convinced that he
cannot get Democratic votes that he
declares that he does not want the
support of other than Republicans. His
one slender chance of success in this
struggle is In obtaining from Republi
cans a promise to settle the fight on the
quiet. Here is the danger to the cause
of clean representation in the United
States Senate. Members of the Legis
lature may be led to believe that the
people are demanding instant termina
tion of the fight and that the struggle
cannot be brought to a finish by other
than caucus methods. One week ago
Grant and Burns might have named the
next United States Senator, but the
campaign of each has been so dis
creditable that the two leading candi
dates combined could not now control
the situation. The bosses were stronger
at the start than they have been since,
and as a result of the weakening the
members of the Legislature may settle
the fight without reference to the plans
of Herrin, Perkins, Burns, McLaughlin,
Green and Brown.
Major McLaughlin asserts that the
headquarters of the Republican State
Central Committee In Sacramento are
expenses he could do so. This limping
defense has caused much amusement
here. Mr. Anderson's reputation foi
honesty and integrity are so well estab
lished that even a flat denial of the
facts testified to by him would not
have affected their weight in the least.
As it is the circumstance has made the
occasion for Mr. Anderson's friends to
indulge in small pleasantries at his ex
pense.
The committee having the investiga
tion in charge is not to be the sole
judge of the worth of the testimony
that has been and will be given. The
readers of this paper are given the
benefit of a full verbatim report of the
proceedings had before the committee.
Every one has an equal opportunity
with the members of the committee to
enter an intelligent judgment for or
against the persons accused.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
not used for the convenience of Col
onel Burns' followers. He insists
that the apartments may be used freely
by all Republicans and any one in
terested in proper legislation for the
State. Let it be admitted that the major
is correct, but still the stubborn fact
remains that the members of the
executive committee of the Republican
State Central Committee, who are here
now and have been here since the
opening of the Senatorial struggle, are
openly advocating the cause of D. M.
Burns. It is unfair to such eminent
and able Republicans as General W. H.
L. Barnes and Hon. R. N. Bulla,
Thomas Bard, Charles N. Felton and
others that they should be forced to en
counter the opposition of members of
the executive committee and that these
members should establish Republican
headquarters in Sacramento at this
time. The significant fact should be
borne in mind that this is not a contest
against a candidate of the common
enemy, the Democratic or fusion party.
It is a contest within the Republican
ranks, and therefore the oreanized ma
chinery of the party should not be put
in motion to advance the claims of any
candidate at the expense of his fellow
aspirants of Republican faith. Fair
dealing, clean politics and a decent re
gard for the sentiments of four-fifths
of the Republican voters of the State
demand that the "organization," so
called, should clear away from this
contest and close up the rooms in Sac
ramento. Major McLaughlin unques
tionably has a right to be here and ex
press his sentiments as a citizen. No
one questions the exercise of that privi
lege by Messrs. Kilburn and Watt, but
they have no right to speak for the execu
tive committee of the Renublican State
Central Committee, or to spread the im
pression that the committee has a
choice among the Republican aspirants.
If that policy is to be pursued let the
executive committee hold an open
meeting and indorse Dan Burns for
United States Senator. The Repub
licans of California are not in a frame
of mind to tolerate much longer the
suggestion thrown out every day that
the "organization" is for Colonel Burns.
It is common for a member of the Leg
islature to remark: "You know that
Burns is not my choice, my personal
preference, but I am with the organi
zation."
Steps should be taken by the Repub
lican voters in every county of Califor
nia to eliminate the "organization"
from this contest, which is purely
within the party. The ppoplÂ» can elect,
the next United State? Senator if they
will brace up the good and true Re
publicans in the Legislature and im
press upon the mird of every legislator
the danger of acceding to any scheme
of sceret caucus.
FACTS OF THE
COSPER STORY.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19. â The sensation of the
hour to-night is the statement made on
the witness stand before the investigat
ing committee by one witness that he
had been 1. formed that Assemblyman
E. T. Cosper had dispatched a trusty
messenger to Milton J. Green, Grant'B
manager, who informed him that Mr.
Cosper had been offered ?6000 to vote
for Daniel M. Burns for United States
Senator and that if he (Cosper) voted
for Grant he thought that he was en
titled to similar consideration.
Inasmuch as Mr. Cosper is the chair
man of the committee investigating the
charges of bribery in the Senatorial
fight, the developments this afternoon
had the effect of creating quite a stir.
Milton J. Green, Grant's manager,
was seen to-night and an endeavor was
made to secure from him the full de
tails of the alleged attempt made by
Charles Lamberson, an attorney of Vi
salia, who, it is stated, carried to Green
this information concerning Assembly
man Cosper's alleged offer from Burns,
and what he C Lamberson) said Cosper
thought he ought to have for voting
and staying with Mr. Grant in the SenÂ»
atorial fight.
Mr. Green declined absolutely to be
interviewed, but he stated that if he
were called and again took the wit
ness stand he would relate everything
that he knew about the Lamberson
and Cosper affair and would tell the
full truth. It is understood from a
high, authentic source that the facts
that will be established on the witness
stand by the testimony of Green and
other witnesses are in substance to this
effect:
That just prior to the time the
joint balloting for Senator commenced

tion of the testimony of J. P. Brown
â â f Wednesday which could not be sent
;n t;::!Â« fur publication:
Q. Did you take any part in advising
with .Mr. Green or Mr. Grant as to what
should be done in close districts?
A. No. sirâ as to specific districts.
Q. Yes.
A. No. sir. In fact, matters political
were seldom discussed before Mr. Grant.
Q. The matter was seldom discussed be-
Mr. Grant?
A. Thut is. political mati
Mr. Mellickâ How about financial mat
ters?
A I had no part in financial matters.
The chairman- Well, in the figuring out
ol this proposition as to rhai.es ol suc
cess on the part of Mr. Grant and Mr. l>.
M. Burns you kept close track as possi
ble upon tho movements and actions 01
Mr. Burns?
A Not as close track as possible prob
ably.
Q Well, as practical?
â¢\ We tried to keep somewhere m touch.
q Well Mr. Brown, 1 think you have
that your Interests and those
of the paper in which you are Interested
were with the candidacy of Mr. Grant i
ask if in the progress of the campaign,
you learned of any Improper metnoaa
pursued by Mr. D. M. Burns In the mat
ter of electing Republican legislators?
\ What do you mean by learn<
Q Well, I mean just what the ordinary
dictionary definition of tho word "learn
ed" is and Its popular significance.
A i do not think 1 could give the best
evidence on that.
Q. Well, will you give such evidence as
A Ob yon will hear ail sorts of rumors
from all sorts of â¢â¢strikers." They Will
come and pretend to have information to
give you 9 borrow half a dollar
or such matter.
Q True 1 will put the question in an
other form. Mr. Brown, that may be
more satisfactory to you. Can you point
this committee to any means whereby
they can probably learn of any improper
means having been used by Mr. I>. M.
Burns to ek-ct Republican legislators who
i be favorable to his candidacy for
United States Senator?
\ you mean Mr. Burns or his friends?

in this Legislature?
A. 1 might later, sir.
Q. Can you do so now?
A. At the moment, no.
Q. And the scope of the question in
?:y candidate, you understand?
A. I understand that perfectly; yes. sir.
Mr. Mellickâ Cannot you tell what you

that I have heard it would lake up a week
of this committee's time telling of the
Idle rumors that were passing around
fac ramento â and always do â during the
; ,; V ,. session. It is common knowl
edge that there are touts and strangers
about that have tales on the end of their
tongues that they are willing to pour
into any man's ear that is willing to give
them a dollar for the information; and I
would not attempt to repeat them or to
drag men's names in.
The chairmanâ l think it would not be
advisable, unlessâ
A. Oh, no.
Mr. Mellickâ But he Is in a position to
know definitely. You are, Mr. Brown.
You know you are.
Mr. Burnett-Give us some of the ru
mors that you have heard. You have got
plenty of time.
A. Oh. we have heard rumors that
money was being used on the other side.
Q. What were those rumors?
A. Oh. nothing. I cannot state specifi
cally now. We nave heard that vast num
bers of people were being brought up here
from Los Ar.Reles; that the Los Angeles
delegation was keeping â working for Mr.

was five or six hundred dollars a day,
and I have heard all sorts of stories.
Q. Who did you hear was putting up
this money?
A. For whom?
Q. For any of the Senatorial candi
dates.
A. I cannot recall now thai they specifi
cally mentioned anybody; but I don't per
mit those things to affect me generally.
But I will try Industriously to see if I
cannot recollect.
Q. Can you recall a single rumor con
necting the name of any candidate for
the United States Senate with any mem
ber of the Legislature as having assisted
him financially? Have you heard, at any
time, of any candidate for United States
Senator having assisted any candidate for
the Legislature?
A. Yes; I heard it here on the witness
stand this morning.
Q. Have you heard it anywhere else?
A. Oh. I have read the stories in the
newspa
Q. Have you heard it in talk on the
streets with your friends?
A. 1 have heard those things that were
published in the newspapers talked. Yes
s:r.
Q. But nothing except what was pub
lished In the newspapers?
A. Well, now you are pinning me down
to try to recollect what was transpiringâ
crowding one thing upon another for two
or tin
Q. Well, you ran recollect some of those
instance , surely.
A. Oh. l have understood that one party
here was sending for members of the Leg
islature and attempting to intimidate
them not to vote for Mr. Grant.
Q. 'Who was that party?
A. Who sent for members of the Leg
islature?
Q. Yes.
A. It was a namesake of mine, named
Brown.
Q. Brown?
A. V-
Q. What Brown?
A. L. H.
Q. What candidatesâ do you know of
any candidate that he sent for? Do you
remember the name?
A. No, I don't know that.
The chairmanâ You mean any legisla
tor, Mr. Burnett?
Mr. Burnettâ Yes.
Q. You said "candidate."
Mr. Burnettâ Legislator, I mean.
Mr. Mellickâ l did not understand that
answer. You say that you have heard
that L. H. Brown was sending for mem
bers of the Legislature and intimidating
them to vote for certain candidates for
Senator?
A. No; telling them thai Mr. Gage
would not give them any patronageâ and
telling them that they could not get any
bills through for their county, etc.
Q. Unless they voted for whom?
A If they voted for Grant.
Q Now, who told you?
a! Who told me that? I don't recollect
now who did tell me that. You see, we
I have dozensâ hundredsâ of people coming
I into our rooms in the night.
I Q. In the night?
| A. Of an evening, you know. The gossip
; in the street is talked about there, and
| I could not recall, really, who said it. j
Q. Was it one of your own workers?
A. I don't know. I don't think so.
i Q. You have a pretty good memory of
i names, haven't you?
I A. No; I think I have got a poor mem
ory of names.
Q. It seem** to me so now. â¢
A. I thin* I have got a poor memory of
names.
Q. But cannot you remember what the
man looked like? Was it an old man?
A. Oh, I suppose there were twenty peo-
I ple in the room when that statement was
made.
Q. Name somebody in the room when
thai statement was made.
A. That I cannot tell you.
The chairmanâ Mr. Green present?
A. I could not say that.
Q. Was Mr. Grant present?
A. I could not say. I would say yes as
to that generally, because Mr. Grant is
: always present, I think, in the general
: room. However, it seems to me that Mr.
Brown could be sent for and asked
whether he did it or not. I don't remem
ber who told me.
The chairmanâ l think, myself, Brown
"might be sent for.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, you said that you
heard that Brown was intimidating?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. You used the word "intimidating"?
A. That is the word.
The chairmanâ The s clerk will issue a
subpena for Mr. Brown.
Mr. Mellickâ then, you say that
you heard that a certain candidate was
sending to Los Angelesâ spending how
much did you say? Five or six hundred
dollars?
; A. Oh, I would sayâ l would estimateâ l
understood they had sixty-one people
here, and I estimated it would take five
or six hundred dollars a day to keep them
going; and I know that every session
when thÂ«ry come to vote on joint ballot
each man has two guardians, who sit
beside him.
Q. And how many people has Grant got
here?
A. Grant? Oh, I don't think he hasâ l
don t know how many he has got here.
Q. I mean on the payroll.
A. Well, I don't know of any payroll.
Q. Do not know of any payroll?
A. No, sir.
The chairmanâ Do you know of any
roll for any candidate?
A. No. sir.
Mr. Mellickâ you know whether
James B. Kelly is on the payroll?
A. I don't. I say I don't know of any
payroll.
Q. Did you have a conversation with
Mr. James B. Kelly regarding certain
legislators to vote for Grant?
A. Did I have a conversation?
Q. Yes.
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you have a conversation with
Mr. Kelly in regard to getting certain pa
pers to support Mr. Grant?
A. Certain papers? No, sir.
Q. Any paper?
A. No, sir.
Q. Never had a conversation with him
in regard to Grant's candidacy?
A. Oh, I do not think there is any ques
tion I have talked of Grant's candidacy,
but certainly I never asked Mr. Kelly
to get any newspaper to support Mr.
Grant.
Q. Well, I meanâ or tried to influence
any legislator?
A. No, sir.
Q. Well, to promote Grant's candidacy
in any way?
A. Well, Mr. Kelly and Iâ we didn'tâ l
have never talked to Mr. Kelly about
members of the Legislature or newspa
pers or anything of that character.
Q. Or Grant's candidacy?
A, Oh, yes; talked about Grant's can
didacy.
Q. Weii, what did you say to him?
A. Well, I don't knowâ simply I thought
he was a good candidate; he' thought he
was one, and I thought he was one, and I
think so yet. It is difficult to go back
over conversations and repeat what was
said.
Mr. Mellick â Well, now, you knew a
year ago. you say, that Colonel Burns
was going to be a candidate for United
States Senator?
A. I did not say I knew it. I said I be
lieved it.
Q. And then that you planned Grant's
campaign accordingly?
A. Very largely, sir.
Q. And what led you to believe that
Colonel Burns would be a candidate?
A. I heard It In San Francisco.
Q. And who told you?
A. Oh, I don't remember who it was
told me. I don't remember who it was.
Q. I suppose, then, during the campaign
youâ believing that Colonel Burns would
be the opposing Senatorial candidate â
watched his acts pretty closely, so far as
you know? 7- â â '-..<â â 
A. Oh. no. I am. not a spy, you know.
Q. But merely In a general way, as you
say.
A. No, I don't know as I paid any par
ticular attention to him.
Q. Well, do you know of anything dur
ing the campaign that led you to believe
that he was specially promoting his can
didacy during the progress of the general
campaign?
A. Do I know of anything that he was
doing?
Q. Yes, did you hear of any cases where
he was spending money for special can
didates?
A. He as an individual?
Q. Yes.
A. No, sir.
Q. Now, then, you say that you were
one of the advisers of Mr. Grant. Were
you one of the advisers that told him to
contribute this money directly to the
legislative candidates rather than to put
it Into the campaign fund of the State
Central Committee?
A. Well, I don't recollect that I advised
him that specifically; but if the question
was asked me I should certainly have ad
vised him not to have put it in the hands !
of the Republican State Central Commit
tee.
Q. On what ground?
A. On the ground that the chairman of
that committee was not for Grant; and
I don't think I would trust to the ex
penditure of money to be scattered all
over the whole ticket when he had am
ple funds. \
Q. Do you understand that. Major Mc-
Laughlln was In any way slighting the
legislative ticket?
A. Do I understand that he was?
Q. Yes.
A. Oh. no; I never heard that.
Q. Well, then, if you had contributed
money to the State Central Committee's
fund you would have just promoted the
whole ticket, rather than one special leg
islator?
A. I presume that might have been so.
Mr. Burnettâ You say you made a num
ber of trips throughout the State during
the campaign and before the campaign?
A. No. sir.
Q. Well, you said that you made one to
Los Angeles?
A. I said I made several trips to Los
Angeles. I made two, I think, to Los
Angeles.
Q. Who did you go to Los Angeles to
see?
A.I went down ; to ' Los Angeles to see
Mr. Mosler on two occasions.
Mr. Mellickâ Mosier? You mean L. E.
Mosier. editor of the Times?
A. Yes. â¢ : V '; â  - * ' {
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1899.
Mr. Burnettâ What did you go to see
him for?
A. I went to argue with him for Mr.
Grant; told him I thought Mr. Grant was
a good man; tried to convince him that
he was an available candidate.
Q. To secure the support of his paper
for Mr. Grant?
A. Yes, sir, which he afterward gave
without a dollar of compensation or with
out exacting any character of a promise
from Mr. Grant or from any one else
that I am aware of.
Q. Well, what propositions were made
to Mr. Mosier to secure the support of his
paper?
A. What propositions?
Q. Yes.
A. Simply the arguments that one man
might make to get another to support
his friend.
Q. Well, I understand that you made a
trip East?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. In the interests of Grant's cam
paign?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Whom did you go East to see?
A. I went East to see, among others â
to see that there wasn't any influence
out here brought to bear to defeat Mr.
Grant.
Q. Who did you see in regard to that
matter?
A. Well, I went to see General Hubbard,
for one.
Q. General Hubbard?
A. Yes.
Q. What did Mr. Hubbard say?
A. What did he say?
Q. Yes.
A. He said the railroad company would
toot use any money to elect any man for
the Legislature, or to defeat any man.
Q. Mr. Hubbard said he would take no
part in. the canvass of the State?
A. So I understood him.
Q. Well, who else did you see In the
East?
A. In reference to this matter?
Q. Yes, in reference to the candidacy.
A. I saw Mr. Elkinsâ Senator Elkins.
Q. What did you see Mr. Elkins for?
A. Well, Mr. Grant wanted me to go and
see him, and talk to him about the situa
tion here, and see if he could render him
any assistance anywhere; But he evident
ly could not.
Q. What did Mr. Elkins say?
A. Oh. he talked very friendly of Mr
Grantâ knew him since he was a boy,
liked him very much, and knew him
as an honest man; believed he would be
a very good Senator.
Q. Did he agree to lend his influence to
Mr. Grant's candidacy?
A. Did he agree to do it? He agreed to
do anything he could, but as he confessed,
he did not see anywhere that he could
help.
y. Did you see any one else in the East
in connection with the candidacy of Mr.
Grant?
A. I saw Mr. Grant's mother.
Q. Any one else?
A. Not that I call to mind now.
Q. Do you know of any one else that
went East In the interests of Mr. Grajit's
candidacy ?
A. Not that I know of.
Q. What did you ask Mr. Hubbard to do
for Mr. Grant's candidacy?
A. Did not ask him to do anything for
it. I asked him not to do anything
against it.
Q. Did he agree to that?
A. He said that they would do nothing
against any one or for any one.
The chairmanâ Mr. Brown, you have
stated that your people thought that Mr.
Burns would be the man.
A. We thought so; yes.
Q. Against Mr. Grant?
A. We thought so.
Q. How soon did you determine that the
man you would have to fight in this can
idacy was Mr. Burns? How early in the
campaign?
A. Well, we always figured that we
would have to fight Mr. Burns or his mr
fiuence straight through. Not as an in
dividual, of courseâ as an dldividual can
didate. That was settled when the an
nouncement was made in San Francisco
that he would be a candidate; but I al
ways thought that he might be one.
Q. About what time was the candidacy
of Mr. Burns for the United States Senate
announced in San Francisco?
A. Oh, not but a little while previous to
the convening of this Legislature, I be
lieve.
Q. Not more than four weeks before the
convening of the Legislature, was it?
A. Not more than four weeks.
Q. Well, prior to that time, or at least
up to two or three weeks before that time,
did you not understand that Mr. Burns
was friendly to the candidacy of M. H.
de Young?
A. That was common rumor; yes, sir.
Q. That was your feeling, as one of the
managers for Grant, was it not?
A. I figured It was either Mr. de Young
or Mr Burns, and in either event it would
have been Mr. Burns' strength that he
would have to fight or have to overcome.
Q. You figured against the strength of
Mr. Burns and not the strength of Mr.
de Young?
A. Well, we figured on both. I don't
think we omitted to figure on anything
that was dangerous.
The chairmanâ You are excused, Mr.
Brown.
UNFINISHED TESTIMONY
OF HOWARD E. WRIGHT
Following is that portion of the tes
timony of Howard E. Wright omitted
last night:
The chairman â Had you in any conver
sation with Mr. Leake intimated that you
would shoot, strike or otherwise damage
Mr. Leake?
A. No, sir, never.
Q. Anything of that sort?
A. Never.
Q. Did you receive any other money In
aid of your candidacy than the money re
ceived as you have stated?
A. No, sir.
The chairmanâ I am not quite clear as
to whether you have testified that you
told Mr. Leake that you got the $900 of
Mr. Green.
A. No. I have said I had testified that
I did not say to him I had received $900.
Q. And you have testified, have you not,
that you told Mr. Leake that you had
put the money that you got from Mr.
Green into your candidacy?
A. Yes, sir, I had said this; that I had
this $750 and it was in regard to a busi
ness transaction, which I supposed he
understood from the letter In his hand;
and he said, "Well, you got some other
money from Mr. Green." I said, "Yes;
that all went into my campaign," but the
amount was never mentioned at all.
Q. Oh, I see.
A. The first time I have expressed this
matter Is in this testimony to-night.
The. chairmanâ Do you think of any
thing else, gentlemen, you want to In
quire about?
Mr. Mellickâ Going back, Mr. Wright,
to your getting the original $900â you say
you got $500 and $400â you had the con
versation with Mr. Green on tne boat;
then afterward you received the money in
person. What was said at the time that
you received this $500 and $400 in person,
and from whom did you receive it?
A. I received it from Mr. Green.
Q. And what was said at that timeâ do
you remember?
A. I do not remember of anything that
was said.
Q. If there had been anything said to
bind you to his Senatorial candidacy you
would have?
A. I certainly should have remembered
It, yes, sir.
The chairmanâ Anything further, gen
tle-men?
Mr. Lardnorâ T think Mr. Leake referred
to one m.itter th^t hn<= not been touched
upon: that In. that the organisation of
committees, etc.. was withheld till after
he found out how the different members
of the Assembly stood and then organ
ized them according to the wishes of cer
tain prominent candidates, or influences
of that character were held out or used
against you. or toward you. What can
you say as to that matter? I think Mr.
Leake referred to it in his testimony.
Mr. Mellickâ l think he only referred to
it in the case of Muenter, and that has
already been answered in regard to Mr.
Wright.
Tli.' witnessâ As also have T said in my
testimony to-night, Mr. Mellick. that I
formed my committees without reference
to Senatorial candidates or corporations.
Mr. Lardnerâ T do not know but what
it was referred to by Mr. Leakeâ l think
it wasâ that the committees were an
nounced, and then, after the preferences
of different candidates were found out,
they were shifted to their detriment.
A. I do not remember that testimony.
Q. Was it a fact, or was it not a fact?
A. It was not a fact; not a fact.
The chairmanâ There is another branch
of Mr. Leake's testimony that I would
like to inquire about, Mr. Wright. Did
you say to Mr. Leake on Saturday even
ing that if he would not make the ex
posures mentioned by you you would try
to persuade Colonel Burns to get out of
the Senatorial fight?
A. I did not. I told Mr. Leake I was
going to continue to vote for Mr. Burns,
as I have testified in answer to a question
you have put here to-night.
Q. Did you say to Mr. Leake in any of
that conversation that for any consider
ation whatever you would attempt to get
Mr. Burns to withdraw from the Sena
torial fight?
A. I did not. And for further corrob
oration of my testimony I would ask that
Colonel Burns be subpenaed and asked
whether, at any time, I have requested
him to get out of the fight.
Q. Well, that would not prove anything
as to your conversations.
A. Well, I did not say so, Mr. Cosper.
Mr. Lardnerâ l want to understand.
One other question about this man Prin
f;le. Did he receive any money at all
rom you?
A. Yes, sir, he did.
Q. What was the consideration for that?
How did that happen?
A. The consideration was this: He was
a very poor young man; he had been mak
ing a hard fight in the hope of being
elected. Aside from that, he was very
much interested in Mr. Jordan's cam
paign. Mr. Jordan himself, after Mr.
Pringle had withdrawn, came to me and
told me of Mr. Pringle's condition, and I
said, "Well, if that is the case, Frank, I
will help him out. If he has been put to
this expense under the hope that he was
going to be elected, why, I will return a
portion of it to him," and that informa
tion was taken to Mr. Pringle,. and later I
did give him a portion of his expenses.
Q. How much?
A. Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Q. Was any portion of that a portion of
the Green money?
A. Yes, sir; it was money that I had
received from Mr. Green.
Q. That you had received from Green?
A. Yes, sir.
Mr. Mellickâ Now, Mr. Wright, will you
tell the reason why, after you voted for
Mr. Bulla, you turned and voted for Colo
nel Burns?
A. I voted for Mr. Bulla because I had
told him a year ago that if he were a
candidate and I were ever elected to the
Legislature I would be very glad to vote
for him. Before the time came for voting
I went to Mr. Bulla and said that I was
going to give him a complimentary vote,
and if it developed that he would have
strength enough to win I should be glad
to vote right along for him. Colonel
Burns' candidacy, in the meantime, as I
have testified here before, was interest
ing me greatly. I had been receiving in
formation in regard to the charges that
The Call and the Chronicle had made
against him, and the information I re
ceived led me to believe that the charges
were false and were untrue. I went to
Mr. Bulla and told him that I was going
to vote for Colonel Burns, and did so.
That Is all.
Mr. Lardner â You had heard those old
charges before, hadn't you, Mr. Wright?
A. Yes, sir. They had been sounded
very much In the newspapers, but I hadn't
had a chance until I came here to investi-
I gate carefully. The Chronicle, I under- !
stand, sent Mr. Rathom over to Yolo
County, and he was unable toâ from the â¢
information I receivedâ justify the j
charges that the Chronicle had made in ,
regard to Colonel Burns' life there; and !
I understand from a very intimate friend of
Mr. Ed Leake that Mr. Leake of The Call \
j had written to him (Ed Leake) in Y'olo j
J asking him to furnish The Call with any- |
! thing to the detriment of Colonel Burns
1 that could be found; and I heard that Mr. :
| Ed Leake said that there was nothing i
| against Colonel Burns in Y'olo County, ;
; and that the people were his frlend3
1 there. All of those things went to form ;
my opinion, which had been in doubt.
The chairmanâ How about that Supreme
Court Judge business?
A. How do ydu mean, Mr. Cosper? |
Q. It has been asserted somewhereâ l
do not remember just whereâ that one of
th elements that entered into your deter- '<
mining the matter was that you had re
i ceived information that four Judges of '
the Supreme Court had expressed their
opinion to you that the charges against j
Mr. Burns were false, and that his can- j
! dldacy was a desirable one.
A. No. I think you misunderstood the
I matter, Mr. Cosper. I stated in an inter
i viewâ in my statementâ that I had re- j
! ceived from an authentic source the in- j
; formation that four of the Supreme Jus- j
i tices were favorable to Mr. Burns tor
! Senator; and The Call did not ask that \
question. The Call asked them whether j
| they had said any such thing to me. The :
, Call never has asked them the question â 
, whether they are favorable to Mr. Burns 'â 
I or unfavorable to him. I do not know why j
I The Call does not do so. I imagine they
; would get quite different answers from
' the ones published, if they did.
| Mr. Mellickâ Well, Mr. Wright, of course |
| it is our business to trace down any ru- i
mor in regard to any candidate.
A. Certainly it is.
Q. The day that you voted differently
voted to change your vote from Bulla to
j Burns, I heard that Colonel Burns had
' invited you up to his room and told you I
i that, if you aid not come Into his camp j
: to vote for him, that your whole work as !
Speaker would be a failure, and that i
â  therefore you changed.
A. That is absolutely and unqualinedly
untrue, Mr. Mellick.
Q. I wished only to give you a chance to
j explain.
A. There never has been any such Inter
view between Colonel Burns and me, nor
has Colonel Burns ever requested me to
vote for him. I voted upon my own volition
and because I believed then, and I believe
now, that it Is the proper thing to do.
The chairmanâ Was your change of
vote from Bulla to Burns induced by any
promise, consideration by way of money
or of patronage through Mr. Burns or
any agent of Mr. Burns?
A. Not in the slightest degree, sir
Mr. Lardnerâ Was your change from
Mr. Bulla to Mr. Burns prompted by any
instructions from your district?
A. No, sir.
Mr. Mellickâ Had you received help
from Colonel Burns or the State Central
Committee in getting your nomination?
A. No, sir.
Q. How long have you known Colonel
Burns?
A. I have known him since 1897
Mr. Devlinâ l would like to ask at this
stage, Mr. Chairman, are you going to
ask every member of the Legislature the
reason he voted for a candidate?
The chairmanâ l have stated repeatedly
the course this committee follows will be
a matter of development.
Mr. Devlinâ l think the witness has
fully and fairly answered all of the ques
tions.
The chairmanâ l think he has. I think
it is not to his detriment that he has.
Mr. Devlin â And it puts a witness, some
times, in a delicate position to speak of
the merits of different candidates.
Mr. Mellickâ The reason I asked him
specially Is because the attorneys for Mr.
Grant and 'friends of Mr. Grant seem to
think we are specially directing this in
vestigation that way.
The witness â I have no objection, gen
tlemen. I am very glad to answer your
inquiries.
Mr. Mellickâ He has voted for. Colonel
Burns, and we want to find out the rea
sons.
Mr. Devlinâ All right; I have no objec
tion.
Mr. Sanfordâ There is one thing, I be
lieve, Mr. Wright, that has been over
looked. I believe Mr. Leake said you told
him that you promised your wife never
to vote for Colonel Burns.
A. Well, that is untrue.
Q. No such conversation took place?
A. That is untrue. We never had any
such conversation.
The chairmanâ Will you pass judgment
on that question, gentlemen?
(The chairman hands a written ques
tion to the members of the committee.)
The witnessâ l shall object, of course
gentlemen, to The Call conducting this
examination.
Mr. Colver (of The Call)â lf you will
pardon me, I will speak for The Call;
there seems to be no one else to represent
it, and I will act as attorney In fact for
the present. The name of the manager
of The Call has been brought into con
tempt here by the witness, and he has
made the allegation that certain citizens
of Sacramento have referred contemptu
ously to the manager of the paper. Now
sir, he refers to these citizens as promi
nent business men. He is giving them
character; and if they are prominent
business men, I think The Call and
Mr. Leake" himself are entitled to know
who these business men are, and the
public as well, in order to judge as to
their character, and as to whether or not
they are competent to besmirch the char
acter of Mr. Leake.
lli#tlÂ§iS
Chairman, that the extreme delicacy and
the tenderness of The Cafl at . this mo
ment is delightful to me. It Vl.? t thi"
contravention of the usage ih lat the>
have been applying to me here foi a few
days past, and I am glad t Â° i ll% riha .t
fir. Colver-I want to Bay further, that ,
in every charge that has been ma^e
against Mr. Wright the dates and name b
have been given and the parties making
Colyer Pjease sit j
down. We cannot permit indulgence in
things of this kind on either side. .
Mr Colver-If the Speaker can indulge
In them, we can as well. ,â. Â j
The chairman-BeÂ»qulet, sir! Be quiet.
I say that neither side can indulge in
these things any further, nor can tnc j
business of the committee be deterred b>
that kind of conduct. Between you and
Mr. Wright, anything that you want can
be settled in the way of an > nte . rv iew.
The witness-! might suggest, Mr.
Chairman, that we can settle it between
ourselves. It ought to be left in that po
sition. . . j
The chairmanâ That is rr.y position ex-
Mr.' Colverâ When a man denies every
thing he says, thoughâ . ..
The chairmanâ What further has the
committee to do with the examination or ,
Mr. Wright? If there is nothing, we,
will excuse you from the stand. You are j
excused, Mr. Wright.
REPORT OF TESTIMONY
TAKEN YESTERDAY
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.â The com
mittee of investigation met in room 16
of the Capitol building at 2:30 p. m.,
January 19, and the following testi
mony was taken:
L. H. Brown, being sworn, testified
as follows:
The chairmanâ You may state your
name to the committee.
A. Lewis Henry Brown.
Q. Do you know Daniel M. Burns?
A. 1 do.
Q. Do you know Ulysses S. Grant?
A. I do.
Q. Mr. Brown, it has been asserted on
the witness stand here that you had
called some legislators into your pres
ence and intimidated them by stating that
if they did not vote for Daniel M. Burns-
Mr. Mellickâ Oh, no; if they voted for
Grant.
The chairmanâ Yes, that if they voted
for Grant they could not receive any
patronage. I want to ask you if you have
called any legislator before you at any
time to discuss with him the Senatorial
situation?
A. No, sir.
Q. You may name the legislators with
whom you have discussed it.
A. Discussed it with Assemblymen Raw,
Raub and McDonald.
A. Where and when did you discuss the
situation with Mr. Raw?
A. 1 think on the street, if I am not
mistakenâ somewhere along X street.
Q. Do you remember the conversation
that you had with him?
A. The conversations I had with all
three were similar.
Q. Do you remember it?
A. ] think I can recall it.
Q. Will you kindly state to the commit
tee what that conversation was both on
your part and that of Mr. Raw?
A. I was asked what I thought of the
situation and what the outcome would be
and I stated that it looked like a dead
lock, and I thought it possible that Colo
nel Burns would either be the Senator or
name the Senator.
Q. Did you state to him the reasons why
you had come to that conclusion?
A. No, sir.
Q^What reply did Mr. Raw make to
â¦ v, A ; Well< h ? see med to agree with me on
that proposition; particularly the propo
sition that he would name the Senator in
the end.
Q. Did he give you the reasons why he
had come to that conclusion?
catl It .V?ea. t t hlnk h * dW " 'd Â° " Ot re "
Q ;* Was <- i, he <J uestl Â°n of patronage a
AN* discusslon in that conversation?
Q. In any manner or form?
A. No, sir.
Q. Have you at any time since the elec
tion of Mr. Raw to the Assembly dis
cussed the question of patronage?
A. No, sir.
Q. Neither directly nor indirectly'
A. No, sir.
Q. Have you done that In person or
through any agency whatever?
A. No, sir.
Q. Or by letter'
A. No, sir.
Q. Telegraph or telephone?
A. No, sir.
Q. Mr. Brown, where and when did you
have a conversation with Mr. Raub con
cerning the Senatorial situation?
r^'it 1 i th .i n T k U Was walktn S out of the
Capitol, if I am not mistaken, going down
either at lunch hour or after the adjourn
ment of the Assembly-I am not certain
which.
Q. I will return once more to Mr Raw
if you Please Tlad you any other conver
sation with Mr. Raw concerning the Sena
torial situation than the one you have
mentioned? *
thtnv ? : *, 1 / 0 not th nk T have - Ido not
think I had any other that I remember
now. Mr Raw and I are old friends and
we possibly discussed it another time,
but I don't know as we did.
Q. What Is your best recollection in
that regard?
A. Well, I do not remember as we did.
He would be the best witness to that ex
tentâthat is. he could be put on the stand
and could tell you whether we had the
conversation or not, but I do not remem
ber that we did.
Q. Very well. Then returning to Mr
Raub. Can you remember that conversa
tion with Mr. Raub that you have spoken
A. It was a similar conversation to the
one that I had with Mr. Raw. He asked
me what I thought of the situation and
I simply told him about the same thing
And, in fact, I presume that most of the
members have talked with different ones
about the situation. That is a common
occurrence to ask: "Well, how are things
to-day?" J or "What do you think of the
outcome?"
Q. I am asking now particularly of that
conversation.
A. Well, a similar conversation. This
is the extent of any conversation that I
have had with any one.
Q. Well, calling your mind directly to
this conversation with Mr. Raub, if you
can remember it, state what. that conver
sation with Mr. Raub, if you can remem
ber it, state what that conversation was.
A. Well, I remember remarking to him
that it looked as though It would be a
deadlockâ possibly for some time, maybe
a monthâ and I thought in the end why
who ever Colonel Burns threw his
strength to would be elected Senator in
my judgment. That is all. *
Q. Did you lay before him the basis of
your judgment in that respect?
A. No, Ido not know as I did I ao
not remember saying anything further
about it. . . â¢â¢: .-. â -â -..'.
Q. What reply did he make to you in
that regard? - ;|' - - .--
A. He seemed to think, as most outsid
ers have thought, that it would be the
same as I had said; it looked that way
at least. â  . * *'
â  Q. Did the question of patronage arise
in that convention between you and Mr
Raub?
A. No, sir.
&.^l d y J? v . have any communication
with Mr. Raub concerning the matter of
patronage directly or indirectly?
A. No, sir.
Q. By yourself or by any agent of
yours?
A. No, sir. In fact. I know nothing
about the patronage and I hadn't any au
thority to say so either.
Q. Well, we are not inquiring now into
your authority. We are only inquiring as
an To him' you. mentioned that matte? at
A. No, sir. .
Q. Is that the only conversation con
cerning the Senatorial situation that you
have had with Mr. Raub since the Legist
lature began its session? -^egis-
A. Theonly conversation of any extent
It is possible that I passed him on the
street, and he said "No change" or "dead
lock," or something like that, but no con
versation of any length or of any con se"
quence at all; nothing only just passing
the time of day, something like that B
> Q - D i d ,7 0u at w any time after the' elec
tion of Mr.- Raub to the Assembly advise
him in any manner as to his vote on the
Senatorial question? me
A. I did. '^V â 
rJil wm >' ou kindly state to this com
mittee what that advice was?
i A I told him that I thought Mr. Grant's
! chances were good at that time and it
looked as though it was possible of his
i being elected, coming from the south.
i Q Was that the full extent of your ad
vice to him at any time?
A I think that is about the extent of it.
Q Did you at any time advise him to
vote for Daniel M. Burns?
q' bid yoa at any time detail to him
the reasons why a vote for iJaniel M.
1 Burns would be advisable for him?
A. I think it is. possible. that I said that
! when the break came it might be well to
! get on the winning side; something ut
! th (f Dhfyou, directly or indirectly, imme
; diately or remotely, hold out to Mr. Rjub
! any inducements to vote for Mr. Burns .
q' You have been in sympathy with Mr.
Burns' candidacy in this matter, have you
not, Mr. Brown? ... Â
A 1 have since he announced mm.- I
I would like to state that I have had no
authority from Colonel Burns or any oi:e
else for patronage or anything of that
kind, or money or anything else, for that
Q Have you any control or influence
over any possible patronage that might
be given to any legislator?
A. None whatever. you could bring any
Q. Do you feel that you could bring a
influence to bear on the question of pat
ronage in the interest of any legislator
that would vote for the man whose can
didacy you favored for the L nited States
Senate? i
A No sir
q' Have you given to the committee the
full extent of your conversations with
Mr. Raub in that behalf?
A. No, not in behalf of the Senatorial
canvass. â¢ . , â
Q. Kindly detail it in full.
A. I gave Mr. Raub a letter to Mr.
Greenâ letter of introduction.
Q. You wrote that letter, did you?
A. I did. ...
Q. Can you state its contents without
getting the letter? You have not that
letter now? Â'r'L iV .
A. No, sir. The letter would be th
best evidence. I do not recall now the
contents. It was simply a letter of intro
duction. Mr. Raub was the Assembly
man from Yuba and Sutter, and that I
knew him to be an honest man, some
thing of that kind. -
Q. You knew Grant to beâ oh, you knew
Raub to be. â â  x ,
A. Raubâ well, I believe Grant is, too,
for that matter. T Â«â  ,i".
Q. Can you get that letter? Do you
A. I presume Mr. Green has it. I think
he can produce it. '
Q. Do you now remember whether that
letter contained any advice as to what
course he should pursue in the- matter or
his vote?
A. No, sir.
Mr. Mellickâ What difference does it
make?. .. ,
The chairmanâ Well, there is nothing
apparent thus far, Mr. Mellick, but tnis
inquiry is to see whether it may make a
difference. Now. you have detailed all
your conversation with Mr. Raub in this
s p â¬ c t **
A. All' that I recall, yes, sirâ that I re
member. , " Â ,
Q. You speak of Mr. McDonald. Is it
Mr. McDonald of Tuolumne?
A. Of Livermore. _ â 
Q. Known here as McDonald or Ala
meda?
A. Yes, sir. , _
Q. What conversation, if any, had you
with Mr. McDonald concerning the Sen
atorial situation? â . : t : ;i;;.
A. Simply, he asked me what I thought
about the situation and I told him what
I thought the outcome would be; similar
to the others. And that was about the
substance of the conversation so far as
I can recall. I do not remember now the
details. I think that is about what it
was. It was in the presence of another
gentleman or more than one. I know there
were gentlemen present there at the time
of the conversation; a gentleman named
Horton.
Q. Is he a resident of Sacramento, do
you know?
A. Of Livermore. He is here, I believe.
Q. He is here?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Did you in that conversation have
anything to say about patronage?
A. No, sir. -.:â¢. <-â¢-â â¢â  ..â...â ....â  â 
Q. Did you present to Mr. McDonald
any inducement of any character what
soever that would have a tendency to in
fluence his vote for United States Sen
ator?
A. No, sir. I did tell him, I think, if I
am not mistaken, come to recall it, that I
did not believe that Mr. Grant, under the
circumstances, could win; and I presume,
if I am not mistaken, I said something
about getting on the winning side in the
end.
Q. You stated what you believed to bÂ©
the winning side?
A. Well, 1 thought in the endâ l did not
say who the Senator would beâ but I
thought that Colonel Burns Drobably
would name the Senator finally; that is,
I thought his votes, whichever way they
went, would name the Senator. That was
my opinion of â idea.
Q. By saying to him that you thought
that Colonel Burns would name the Sen
ator, did you mean thereby that Colonel
Burns would dictate as to who the Sen
ator would be?
A. No, no. I did not. I simply thought
his votes, wherever they went, if they
went in a body, would probably be suffi
cient to elect the man.
Q. Would be decisive of the question?
A. Yes, sir. For that matter, if Mr.
Grant's votes should go the same way,
probably they would. â ".T.-z
Q. Did you say so to him?
A. I do not recall. I do not think I did.
I do not think I mentioned anything about
Grant's votes.
Q. Now. do you recall any other legis
lator with whom you have had any con
versation concerning the Senatorial situ
ation? -â ->.
A. Not any conversation, but simply a
passing. I remember of meeting Senator
Morehouse down on X street in front of
Hale's store and jokingly mentioned
about getting on the winning side, or
something of that kind. I did not men
tion any names and he said that he was
for Barnes, and I said that Barnes â Gen
eral Barnes â was an ideal Senator. That
was the extent of the conversation as I
passed by. Both of us were laughing
at the conversation.
Q. Have you held up before any legis
lator thc> chances of patronage as an in
ducement for him to vote for any can
didate for United States Senator?
A. No, sir.
Q. Directly or Indirectly?
A. No, sir.
Q. In person, by letter, telegraph or
telephone message?
A. No, sir. I had none to give. I did
not know of any, either.
Q. Do you know. Mr. Brown, of any
meretricious inducements having been of
fered to any legislator by any persona
with the purpose of influencing his vota
for United States Senator?
A. I do not.
Q. Can you point this committee to any
person, papers or other means whereby
they may learn of any improper influ
ences brought to bear upon any legisla
tor to induce him to vote for a United
States Senator?
A. I cannot.
Q. On behalf of any candidate for
United States Senator?
A. I cannot.
Q. Before the Legislature?
A. No, sir.
The chairmanâ Gentlemen of the com
mittee, what further do you wish to ask*
Mr Lardner-The letter that you gave
to Mr. Raub or to Mr. Green-was that
before or after Raub's nomination 0
A. It was after his election.
Q. After his election?
A. Yes. That letter was given at tha
request of Mr. Green. He asked me if I
knew Mr. Raub and I told him I did and
he asked me if I would give him J i<.nÂ«r
of introduction to him. letter

Mr. Leake. the manager of The Call, to
Interview Speaker Wright with reference
â  .to-'a statement that four members of the

â¢â¢:â¢â¢ t; raily anxious to bring Sir. Leake and

W&H.--T had to open the conversation, as 1

Q. So far as any money transaction was I
concerned, then, your conversations were j
confined, were they, to the Question of ,
this $750 loan and any sums that he might
have paid to Mr. Pringle?
A. The conversations- were confined to
that. But I asked each of them about the
$1650. because Mr. Leake had told me that
was the amount and desired me to ask
questions on that point.
Q. Did Mr Wright detail to you at that
time the circumstances attending the loan
of $750?
A. Yes, sir. _â

tors to vote for any candidate for United
States Senator?
A. You mean in the line of suggestion?
Springing from discussion of rumor or
frem absolute knowledge?
Q. Either one.
A. Well, In the line of surgestion, I
would say: Endeavor to get Dan Cole's
letter to Judge c lough.

of names of those who have been assisted
in their race for the Assembly by Mr.
Green?
A. I know nothing of such a list. I never
saw such a list.
Q. Your paper. The Call, has nad the
policy of defeating. If possible, the elec
tion of Daniel M Burns to United States
Li rship, has it not?
A. You will have to asK Mr. Leake
about the policy of The Call.
Q. What is your Judgment about it?
A. You want my judgment?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, I do not want to make a speech
for General Barnes, but I think that
should be the best way out of It â would
be to elect him.
Q. No, that does not answer the ques
tion.
(The reporter read the question.)
Q. Now what is your judgment on that
matter as to what the policy of the pa
per is?
A. Now, that is a mere matter of
opinion. I am not authorized for the pa
per or to define its policy, but it is my
judgment that the policy of the paper Is
t<-> defeat Daniel M. Burns and U. S.
I Grant for the United, States Senate.
Q. Well, Mr. Burke, do you know of
i any improper methods', or methods that
you would consider improper, pursued by
Daniel M. Burns, or any agent of his,
directly or indirectly, to influence the
votes of legislators for United States Sen
ator?
A. Well. now. that is a very broad ques
tion. Mr. Chairman. You have got to
I make the definition of what an impioper
effort is.
Q. I say anything that you consider im
proper. lam leaving it with you, be
cause I cannot do otherwise. Then the
; committee, after you have answered, will
decide for themselves as to whether it is
j Improper?
A. Well, yes. I do.
Q. You may state what it is.
A I think the impression that Colonel
Bums' friends are giving out. that he
represents the organization of the party
and that the patronage will beâ that in
! the distribution of the patronage of the
party Burns' friends will be recognizedâ l
think that is an improper thing.
Q. Do you know, Mr. Burke, If any one
of Mr Burns' friends -who has held out
to any legislator the argument that In
the distribution of patronage Burns'
friends would be recognized?
A No: I cannot point to you a single
man who has said that, but I am morally
convinced that the impression has gone
out.
Q. Can you direct this committee to any
person who can give this committee in
formation in that behalf?
A. Well, I would put Major Mclaughlin
right on the stand. That is the only way
that I know.
Q. That Is the only way that you know?
A. Yes. sir.
Mr. Melllckâ What do you know about
that letter to I>amberson at Visalia?
A. I know only by a report that $1500
was sent to that county In aid of Grant,
but the opposition candidate was elected.
I do not know that it was corruptly used
or anything of that kind, but I have un
derstood â
Q. Do you know to whom It was sent?
A. No."
Q. Do you know who sent it?
A. I do not.
Q. Do you know of any place that we !
could get the Information that would en- I
able us to ascertain who sent it and to
whom it was sent?
A. I do not know of any one, but Mil-
I ton Green might know about It. He might
i know about it; I do not know that he
j knows about it.
Mr. Sanfordâ Did you hear a current re
port as to who sent It?
A. I heard it currently reported that It
was Grant money.
Q. But you did not hear the person that
had sent It?
A. No.
Q. But you did hear that it was sent to
Lamberson?
A. Lamberson. I believe it was, sent to
him. I do not know that he made any
improper use of it. I do not know that he
received it.
The chairmanâ lf I understand you, that
money was sent to Lamberson by letter,
as you understand the report?
A. I do not know how It was sent, but
I think by letter.
Mr. Baconâ May I ask the witness a
question, please?
Mr. Melllckâ l just want to say this:
that he comes here saying that the policy
of his paper Is to defeat Colonel Burns
and Mr. Grant. Now. then, he points us
to this T-amherson letter, telling us that
there was $1500 possibly sent down there.
I do not see what use there is In sending
for that letter. Mr. Boone is here, the
Democrat from that district. Even
though money was sent there it would not
have any effect upon the resolution upon
which we are working. It simply helps
you do what you say the policy of your
paper Isâ defeat of Mr. Grant. I do
not see any use of that kind of testimony
here at all.
The witnessâ Mr. Melllck. I want to cor
rect your statement in one particular.
The chairmanâ l will give you the op
portunity, Mr. Burke.
A. I want to say to Mr. Melllck that I
did not state that it was the policy of
The Call to defeat D. M. Burns and U. S.
Grant.
Q. Only that was your opinion?
A. Only that was my opinion.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Burke, you say that you
have heard that $1500 of Grant's money
was sent down to Mr. Lamborson?
A. To Lamberson, I believe.
Q. Where does he reside?
A. I believe at Visalia.
Q. Who told you that $1500 was sent
down to Mr. Lamberson?
A. I cannot call to mind who told me
but the suggestion came to me that the
committee ought to inquire about that.
Q. Did Mr. Lamberson tell you that he
had received $1500 of Mr. Grant's money?
A. No. I do not know Mr. Lamberson.
Q. Does Mr. Lamberson live in the same
county that Mr. Cosper lives In?
A. That I do not know.
Q. Did Mr. Cosper tell you that Mr.
Lamberson had received . $1500 of Mr.
Grant's money?
A. He did not. t
Q. Did any member of this committee
tell you that Mr. Lamberson had received
$1500 of Mr. Grant's money?
A. No member of the committee told
me so.
Q. Did anybody on earth ever tell you
that Mr. Lamberson had received $1500 of
Mr. Green's money?
A. No.
y. That is what I thought.
A. But I Bald I understood that $1500 was ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1899.
sent to Mr. Lamberson.
The chairmanâ You know, Mr. Burko,
that Mr. Lamberson lives in Visalia, In
Tulare County, and that that is not In the
Fifty-fourth District, from which Mr.
Cosper came?
A. I did not have that in mind at all.
The same simply was Impressed upon m<_'
as money having been sent in the district.

The chairmanâ We have taken a broad
er scope in that matter, gentlemen of the
committee, than we otherwise would have
done for the reason that we are Investi
gating and with the hope that this hear
say matter might bring out some things

cine and positive testimony: but it seems |
to be barren of results thus far. So, Mr.

A. Two personsâ a man and his wife.
y. Returning again to the question of
consideration: Do you know anything

to give for that pass?
A. I do not.
Q. Do you know of any other Influences
that you considered impraner. in the ln
terest of any of the candidates for United i
States Senator?
Mr. Mellickâ Before you leave that other

A. It was obtained at tne solicitation

the language that Mr. Simpson used In
conveying that intelligence to you.
A. I don't recollect the language; but if
you want me to relate the story as I re- .
member it. as it was related to me, I can ,
give you that.
Q. The substance of it. We are not af
ter the exact language.
Mr. Mellickâ l will state that Mr. Simp
son is right there, and we can have him
In a minute instead of having Mr. Levings
second hand.
The chairmanâ You may answer the
question.
A. My recollection of it
at this time is that it was
understood that Mr. Her
rin of the Southern Pacific
Company was giving out
passes to legislators in
the interest of D. M. Burns,
und his candidacy â not
then yet announced except
by Mr. Herrin â for the
U. S. Senate, and a
member of the Chronicle
staff was detailed to as
certain whether or not
that was the truth; and
in the course of his inves
tigations he became ac
quainted with a man who
had been in San Francisco
for a few monthsâ six or
eight months, or a year or
something of that kindâ a
New Yorker, there with his
wife, out of employment,
, and wanting to get home.
During the campaign he
became very well ac
quainted with Mr. Merrill,
who was elected fromâ l
have forgotten the district
âto the Assembly ; and he
applied to Mr. Merrill for
assistance to take him
and his wife to his home
'in New York. Mr. Merrill
went with this man to see
Colonel Burns. Colonel
Burns referred them to Mr.
Bert Worthington, a con
fidential secretary of â I
have forgotten whether it
was Mr. Fillmore or some
other official of the South
ern Pacific Company, and
Mr.Bert Worthington refer
red Mr.Merrill and hisfriend
to Mr. Fillmore, or to Mr.
Huntfngtonâ H. E. Hunting
ton. Mr. Huntington said
that he did not want the
politics of the railroad
mixed up with his depart
ment, and told Mr. Merrill
to go to Colonel Burns and
get a note to Mr. Herrin if
he wanted the transporta
tion. Mr. Merrill returned,
with his friend, to Colonel
Burns, and they entered a
private room and held a
conversation which was
not overheard by any one.
Q. By "they" whom do
you mean?
A. Colonel Burns and
Mr. Merrill.
Q. Not the other man
with him ?
A. The other man was
left out of this private con
ference ; did not know
what transpired ; but
when Mr. Merrill returned
he had a note, and he and
his friend went over to the
railroad building and the
note was presented to Mr.
Herrin, and Mr. Herrin
said, "Wait a minute,"
and gave some instruc
tions to one of his clerks,
and presently the clerk re
turned, handed Mr. Herrin
the envelope, which he, in
turn, handed to Mr. Merrill,
and Mr, Merrill and his
friend went down the
street, where the envelope
was opened ; and it con
tained two passes â one for
Mr. Merrill's friend and one
for Mr. Merrill's friend's
wife, and the reporter for
the Chronicle went across
the bay with his friend,
whose name 1 have forgot
tenâbut he went across
the bay with this friend the
night he started for New
York, and went up the
road as far as Port Costa ;
and all of this was related
to him by Mr. Merrill's
friend. The reporter posed
in the guise of a man from
Philadelphia who was
[stranded financially and
wanted to return, and
wanted to know how he
could get transportation ;
and this friend of Mr. Mer
rill's told him how he could
get itâ how he had got it,
related the whole conver
sation in detail, and then
gave the reporter a note
of introduction to Mr. Mer
rill, in which he recom
mended that Mr. Merrill
again use his good offices
for this financially stranded
Philadelphian who wanted
to go home. That is practi
cally the story that was
told to me.
Q. Have you pxhausted your informa
tion in the direction of improper influ
ences brought to bear upin the legisla
tors, bo far as this one instance is con
cerned?
A. Well, if you confine it to information
I can tell you information that I have,
but the value of it isâ
The chairman -I think we had bettor
have him give us the names of those that
can give the information ami get it di
rect, We may spend a year here on hear
say matters.
Mr Burnettâ l would like to have his
information so far as I am concerned.
The chairm;in--Very well. Then the
question is submitted to you. gentlemen,
whether we shall go into hearsay matters
with this witness or wbetner we shall ask
him for his sources of information and
get it direct from these.
Mr. Burnettâ l think we better get the
information to see whether it is worth
pursuing or not.
Mr. Sanfordâ We can start with it and
see whether It amounts to anything or
not.
The chairmanâ Very well, you may re
late to the committee what information
you have.
A. Information was brought me from
some source that Assemblyman Cosper,
chairman of the committee, had ap
proached Milton J. Green, the political
manager for U. S. Grant, and told him
that either Colonel Burns or his financial
representatives had offered Mr. Cosper
16000 to vote for Mr. Burns; that Mr. Cos
per told Mr. Green that he did not want
to vote for Burns; that he preferred to
vote for Grant, but that if he did vote
for Grant he thought that he should be
remunerated to the extent of the offer
that had been made to him by Colonel
Burns or Colonel Burns' agent. That was
the information. And in justice to Mr.
Cosper. I would like to add to that that I
detailed two reporters of The Call to in
terview Mr. Cosper as to the truth or
falsity of it. and Mr. Cosper denied the
truth of the interview he was said to
have had with Mr. Green in which these
facts were stated.
The chairmanâ Now. I would like to say
to the committee that this matter, being
a somewhat personal one. I hope you will
make the examination exhaustive. If I
can help you out at the end of It I will
do so, but I would rather you would con
duct the examination upon that propo
sition, at least until I see that it is as
exhaustive as I am satisfied with.
Mr. Mellickâ Who told you, .Levings?
A. I do not know.
y. Well, there was the name of some
Assemblyman mentioned in connection
with it. was there not? I did not hear
your story very good. Some one told
you that some Assemblyman â told you
that Mr. Cosper hadâ
A. No; the information that I had was
that Mr. Cosper had gone to Milton Green
and then these other facts transpired.
You wish me to repeat it?
y. I did net hear it very good for some
reason or other.
A. The information was that Assembly
man Cosper had gone to Mr. Green and
told him that Colonel Burns, or some of
Colonel Burns' authorized agents, had of
fered Mr. Cosper $6000 to vote for Colonel
Burns for Senator; that Mr. Cosper told
Mr. Green that he did not want to vote
for Colonel Burns: that he preferred to
vote â when he changed his vote from
what it Us at present â to vote for Mr.
Grant, but that he thought that if he did
vote for Mr. Grant he should be remun
erated to the extent of the offer that had
been made to him by the Burns people.
And I afterward sent two men to see Mr.
Cosper and Mr. Cosper denied the truth
of that information.
Q. I do not understand that exactly.
Do you say that your Information is that
Mr. Green went to Mr. Cosper?
A. That Mr. Cosper went to Mr. Green.
y. When did you hear this, Levings?
A. Four or five days agoâ l do not re
member. Three or four, or four or five
days ago.
y. And where were you when you re
ceived the information?
A. In Sacramento.
Q. Whereabouts?
A. I do not remember.
Q. You haven't any idea whether it was
In the Capitol building?
A. I think it was downtown â probably
was downtown.
y. Down at the Golden Eagle Hotel?
A. Presumably. That is where we meet
most people that have information to
give.
y. You think it was in the Golden Eagle
Hotel?
A. I rather think so.
y. Was it in the evening?
A. I do not remember.
Q. That was a very Important piece of
information, was it not, if it should be
true?
A. If it was true, yes.
y. That should have impressed you. Is
not your memory good enough to have
it impressed on youâ the man that gave it,
or the time, or something about it?
A. I have told you and the committee,
Mr. Mellick, that I do not remember the
source of my Information.
y. No: but I want to try and refresh
your memory.
A. All right; go ahead.
y. Was it a man or a woman that told
you?
A. I do not know. Probably a man.
y. Was he an old man?
A. I am sure I cannot tell you. There is
no desire of evasion that I reply this way.
Q. I know; but I want to refresh your
memory. Mr. Levings.
A. I really do not remember. I have
tried to refresh my own memory before I
came here to-day, because I never expect
ed, after I had ascertained from Mr. Cos
per his denial, to be able â even if it were
trueâ to fix the truth of it, and I dismissed
it from my mind, as there are many other
matters that engage my attention.
y. I know; but you detailed two report
ers, did you not?
A. I did.
y. Who were the two reporters?
A. Mr. Colver and Mr. James.
Q. Mr. Richard Colver and Henry
James?
A. Yes, sir.
y. What did you tell them when you
saw them?
A. I repeated more briefly what I have
told you. and told them to go to Mr.
Cosper and ask him as to the truth or
falsity of it.
y. Both of them?
A. Yes.
y. Did you indicate to them from whom
you had gotten it? , Maybe they will re
member what you told them?
A. No, sir; I did not tell them. I pre
sume I did not. I do not see why I should
have told themâ
Q. You gave them no inkling of what
kind of a man it was that told you about
it, nor anything of the kind? Did not
you give them any inkling except, just
go and Interview him?
A. That is ail.
y. Well, do you think they have ac
knowledge of who it was that told you?
A. I know they have not.
y. You did not dream it?
A No- I did not dream it.
y. It seems to me that you ought to
remember something about the kind of a
man that would tell you such a story as
that: I surely would.
A. That is a very natural thought, I
will admit.
y. Did you believe it when you heard it?
A. I neither believed nor disbelieved it.
y. Then you had it in your mind in
abeyance to find out. did you not?
A. I intended to find out about it if I
could.
(J. Did you inquire any more about It
yourself?
A. I do not think I made any direct in
quiries. I possibly tried to ascertain
some of Mr. Cosper's antecedents or his
political connections, or something of that
kind; I do net recollect whether I did 01
not.
Q. Did you inquire from Mr. Colver 01
Mr. James as to what they found out?
A. They reported back "that Mr. ( JoÂ»
per had denied that there was any trutfc
in the statement which they put to hire
and which I asked them to.
W. Did Mr. Green deny it also?
A. I did not ask Mr. Green.
Q. I mean did Mr. James or Mr. Colvei
ask Mr. tlreen?
A. They did not.
Q. Then you were satisfied that it waÂ«
not true when your reporters came bach
with that report?
A. I wai
<J. Then what else did you do?
A. I dropped it temporarily.
Q. Did you make any note of It in I
note book or anywhere eU
A. I did not.
Q. No way of refreshing your memorj
as to who told you at all?
A. Not that I know of.
Mr. Burnettâ Do you know of any onÂ«
who could pive us information In r
to It outsid'- of Mr. Green and Mr. Cosperi
A. No; I do not. If 1 did I would hayÂ«
got it myself.
Mr. Lardnerâ How lone: ago was it thai
you instructed the two reporters to gc
and interview Mr
A. My recollection is that it was last
Sunday. Mr. Cosper probably will re
member.
The chairmanâ l will testify aftei
awhile.
The witnessâ l do not remember thÂ«
day.
Mr. Melllckâ Mr. Levings. It seem? t~
me a little bit unfair to oring up a thing
of this kind without having some idea aÂ»
to who tolil you.
A. Very well.
Q. Do you not .think it Is possible foi
you to refresh your memory if we givÂ«
you time?
A. If I do, I will certainly volunteer thÂ«
information to the committee.
Q. There iB no data of any kind that you
could go to and help your memory?
A. I nave no knowledge of any.
Mr. Burnettâ Was it an absolute stran
ger who told you this?
A. I do not know. I tell you I do not
remember who it was.
The chairmanâ Mr. Melllck Is hereby
designated as the chairman of this com
mittee for the time being. I desire to bÂ«
sworn, gentlemen.
Cosper on the Stand.
Mr. Cosper, being sworn, testified as
follows: .
On last Sabbath afternoon, at about 9
o'clock, I was in my room at No. 809 L
street, with my wife, doing some work In
connection with the contested election.
The door bell rang-. Two gentlemen stood
at the door and said to the landlady that
they desired to see Mr. Cosper, or "some
thing to that effect. I stepped to the head
of the stairway and called them up. I
had seen the gentlemen be-fore about th<i
mrrldcrs of the Goden Eagle Hotel, but
dtl not know" them. They came Into tlia
roorr. and asked if they could see me
alone I said to them, "Certainly," and
requested that my wife go into one of the
other rooms that we have there. She left
the room, and I then asked them what
their business was. I do not remember
the language I used in that respect. And
they began to tell me something of the
story that Mr. Levings has detailed on
this stand just now. I said to them:
"Gentlemen, the lady that was with me
is my wife, and if you have any interview
to seek with me It must Tie in the pres
ence of my wife." They said "Cer
tainly," that was agreeable to them, or
I to that effect. So, I called Mrs.
Cosper into the room. They stated their
names to me. The smaller man said that
his name was Colver. and introduced me
to the taller man, saying that his name
was Mr. James. Then they said to me â
Mr. Colver, by the way, was the spokes
manâhe said to me that they had a mat
ter to tell me about that they thought
perhaps I would not care to have my wifa
hear was the reason that they had "asked
me to see them alone. I saiQ to them that
there was nothing in my actions or In
my career in any way at ail that I was
not perfectly willing that my wife
should know. They safd then that
that was perfectly satisfactory to
them. Then they went on to say
that there was a rumor on the street that
Mr. Green was saying that I had sent
somebody to him â not naming that body,
by the way â to' him with a statement to
the effectâ l do not know that I can re
peat tne exact language, but the sub
stance is very clear in my mindâ to the
effect. I say, that Colonel Burns, or some
body in his interest, and offered me $6000
if I would vote for him for United States
Senator, and that I did not so desire to
vote for him, but that if I should vote
for Mr. Grant they ought to do as well
by me, I think, was the langnage that
was used. Well, I said: "Gentlemen,
from what sources do you receive any
such Information as this?" They said
they were not able to tell me. I said, "To
whom did Mr. Green say this?" They
said they did not know. I said to Mr.
Colver that the man who reiterates a
scandal is equally guilty in law and
morals with him who originally pub
lishes it, and I hold you per
sonally responsible for this statement."
I think, like what they say of my friend
Wright, I was a little hot and said some
thing to the effect that I should hold any
body strictly responsible, and Mr. Colver
said that he was entirely willing to ue
responsibleâ that is, he said, "The man
agers of our paper are." "Oh." I said,
"a libel suit or a suit for slander is no
remedy for a man that the newspapers
attack. The only remedy Is a shotgun,
and It may be that it will be necessary
for me to use it." That is irrelevant,
but still I am trying to give the entire
conversation. They said it was not In any
aggravated sense like that they came to
me, and they seemed to be fair in their
way of treating the matter, and I cooled
down. It is not my custom to get off
my base that way generally. I then
pressed the matter as to whom Mr. Green
had made this statement. My theory is
that Mr. Colver said that he did not know
âthat he was not' certain, but that ha
thought that it was Mr. Leake.
Mr. Mellickâ Which Leake?
A. I think the term then wa3 Mr. Leake.
My understanding was that it was the
man they called "Sam" Leake. But how
I got that understanding I cannot de
scribe to you. I said, "I want to sec Mr.
Green and Mr. Leake." They said, "We
felt that you ought to have at least the
opportunity to deny such a charge as
that." 1 said, "I thank you for that kind
ness." or something to that effect. I said,
"You may say that if any man, Milton J.
Green or any other, says that I sent to
him any word or intimation that I de
sired him to give $6000, one or any other
number of dollars for my vote for United
States Senator, he is a devilish liar." And
I think I said something to the effect that
I desired to crowd that lie down his
throat. I do not know what it was that
I said, but something to that effect.
I said further that if any man has inti
mated that Daniel M. Burns. Ulysses S.
Grant, or any other candidate for United
States Senator has offered me any con
sideration of any kind whatsoever for my
vote for United States Senator that that
man is a liarâ that any such statement
or intimation Is an absolute and uncon
ditional lie, and I so reiterate that fact
to this committee now. I say that no
man has offered me, or so far as I know
intimated to me that I might have a
meretritious consideration for my vote for
any candidate that is before this Legis
lature for the office of United States Sen
ator. I think I said to these gentlemen
that if they would inquire Into my his
tory and antecedents they would readily
learn that such an offer would not be
entertained for a moment by me or by
any of my friends. I had my overcoat
and hat on when these gentlemen came
and was about to go up to the Golden
Eagle Hotel to catch the news. When
they reported I went immediately to the
Golden Eagle Hotel and sought to find
Mr. Green. I did not find him. I did not
know Mr. Leake, but I desired to se-j Mr.
Green first, to know whether there w.is
any truth or shadow of truth in any such,
statement as that that he had male such
a statement concerning me. I do not now
remember whether I went homo to my
room prior to this second circumstance or
not. but the second circumstance is this:
That that evening, while standing by th<j
lunch counter of the Golden Ea^le Hotel,
Mr. Colver came to me and said to me
that "we do not intend to use that inter
view and the matter had better drop
where it is." What his language was I
cannot quite recall, but my understanding
was, as he conveyed it to me, that they
had run it down and considered there was
nothing in it. At least I so felt and said
nothing about it until two or three days
ago, I met Mr. Green in the hallway near
the statuary, on this floor of this building.
As a reason for not finding those gentle
men before. I will say that, after having
been appointed the chairman of this com
mittee. I felt that I did not want to be at
the headquarters of any of the can
didates for United States Senator,
and I have keut away from them
because I wanted to keep my mind in
the condition that the mind of a Juror
ought to be â unprejudiced and unbiased
by any of those incidental remarks that
a .man Is apt to get in such a place as
34
INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
that in the interest of candidates for
United States Senator. That was tne
reason I did not go directly to Mr. Grant's
headquarters to see Mr. Green. And the
time I speak of, when I met Mr. Green in
the corridors of the Capitol building, was
the first time I had met him after this
Interview with The Call reporters. I then
told him what the rumor was. He de
nied most emphatically to me that he
> v. r made any such statement at all, or
anything that approached it in charac
ter. Now. gentlemen of the committee,
I request of you the most searching ex
aminationânot only into what I know and
s.iy about the matter, but anything you
may learn concerning the matter, and I
am in your hands tor examination.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Oosper, as I am a friend
of and appear here for Mr. Grant, I would
like to ask just one question. You say
you met Mr. Green out in the hall here?
A. Yos.
cj. Ajid Mr. Green denied to you that he
had circulated such a report?
,\. Vcs.
y. I did not quite understand it.
A. I thought I had so stated.
Q. 1 think you did, but my attention
was directed to something else at the
time.
A. He convinced me that he had not.
His manner was that of indignation and
honesty. 1 am one who believes that
truth presents itself with its own force
through the words and acts of men, and
I believed what he said and dropped the
matter without the expectation that any
thing more would be said about it. but
without any fear, I assure you. if anybody
wants tn say anything about it.
Mr Burnettâ Have you had any conver
sation with Daniel M. Burns since you
came to Sacramento?
A. Yes, sir. *
Q. What was the nature of that conver-
A. I was In Mr. Burns' headquarters
very soon atter I came ..ere, as I was in
the headquarters of every candidate that
had headquarters. I think. I asked Mr.
Burns what his chances were for the office
of United States Senator. I do not know
what he said to me, Mr. Burnett, about
the matter. I had so many talks with so
many of them. 1 was repeatedly in Mr.
Grant's headquarters; I was repeatedly in
Mr Bulla's headquarters, and I was re
peatedly in Mr. Barnes' headquarters,
smoked their cigars and received their
kindly treatment.
Q. Did Mr. Burns offer you any induce
ment at any time or ask you to support
him?
A. Mr. Burns never asked me to support
him. I have already said that he never
offered me any inducement.
Q. Did any of Mr, Burns' friends offer
you any inducement or request you to sup
port Mr. Burns?
A I do not knew who Mr. Burns
friends are. I will make that clear by
Baying that nobody had offered me any
Inducement*â Mr. Burns' friends or any
other candidate's friendsâ any other in
ducements than this: That they have
held out to me the arguments as to why
this man and that should be elected to the
United States Senate. Of course, Mr.
Burns' friends came ana talked to me,
showing me why he ought to be
elected. Mr. Burns' friendsâ Mr. Booth
and Mr. Reichert and Mr. Green did that,
and Mr. Hamilton, I think his name is,
on the part of Mr. Burns. 1 do not sup
pose you mean that kind of inducement,
though â only such inducements as pre-
Bent themselves to a man's reason and
Judgment.
Q. I had reference to patronage or finan
cial assistance.
A. My answer has already covered that.
Mr. Melllckâ Mr. Cosper, believing that
you want to give an unqualified denial
it seems to me that there is one phase of
it you have not touched, and that is this:
You say that no candidate has given you
money or any inducement to support him?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, in view of the developments so
farâ take it in another â has any can
didate, without regard to inducement or
any consideration whatever, given you
any money or offer of patronage?
A. Not any whatever.
Q. Did any candidate for United States
Senator put any money in your legisla
tive fight?
A. Not to my personal knowledge. I
want to say to the committee that I had
heard after my election that money was
pent into the district from which Mr.
Bo. me comes and that that money: was
expended in the interest of the candidate
opposed to Mr. Boone and the candidate
for the Senate opposed to. Senator H. L.
Pace, and that probably some of that
money was expended in my interest, in
asmuch as a portion of my district lies
in Tulare County; but personally I have
no knowledge of that matter.
Mr. Burnettâ Did you receive any com
munication during the campaign from Mr.
Green or Mr. Brown?
A. None whatever.
Q. Or Mr. Kelly?
A. None whatever. I did not know Mr.
Green, Mr. Brown, nor Mr. Kelly. Ido
not know Mr. Kelly.
Q. Well, have you had any conversa
tion in regard to United States Senator
with Mr. ureen since coming here?
A. Repeatedly.
y. What was the nature of the conver
sations?
A. The nature of the conversations was
always as to Mr. Grant's qualifications,
and the claims that be had upon the peo
ple for the office; never in the nature of
a financial transaction or patronage
transaction, in any way whatever.
Q. Did he at any time give you any
reason why he believed Mr. Grant would
be elected? â¢
A. Would be elected?
Q. Yes, end the reason why.
A. I think he has said to me that, In his
Judgment. Mr. Grant Would finally win
out, but I do not now remember that in
any conversation he analyzed the reasons
for that judgment and laid them before
me.
Q. Did he at any time submit to you a
list written or give you a list verbally of
representatives that would vote for Mr.
Grant, or that he expected would vote
for Mr. Grant?
A. He had on a little slip of paper at
one time a list of men whom he had would
support Mr. Grant. But when I came here
âthat was early in my history in Sacra
mentoâand when I came here the only
legislators with whom I was acquainted
were W. P. Boone of Tulare County, H.
L. Pace, the Senator from our own town,
and I could not remember Mr. Burnett,
the names of those people. I presume, if
they were handed to me now â the same
listâ l would know them well enough to
remember them.
Q. You do not remember the name of a
single man on the list, do you?
A. Wait until I can think a moment. I
really do not think I can recall a solitary
name. I was not familiar with the names
elected .to this Legislature at that time.
Mr. Mf Hickâ Was that a printed list?
A. No, sir. It was a lead pencil list.
Q. Did It pretend to be the signatures
of the members? Was It claimed to be
the signatures of legislators?
A. I think about a half dozen names or
thereabouts purported to be signatures
of legislators.
Q. And was it claimed that they had
signed an agreement to support Mr.
Grant?
A. I think so. My memory of it is this:
That the head of that list was that "We
hereby pledge ourselves to vote for U. S.
Grant Jr. for United States Senator so
long as we shall have a chance for elec
tion." I may be off on that. That is as
near as I can remember.
Mr. La Bareeâ How many names were
attached to that list?
A. Well, I did not count them, Mr. La
Baree. My own judgment is that there
were about a dozen. I had the Impres
sionâbut how I got jt i cannot tellâ that
that was only a portion of a complete
list; and I think probably I got that im
pression from the statement made to me
by Mr. Green at the same time that there
were twenty-five or more who stood
pledged to vote for Mr. Grant; but I am
not sure that he said that thpy stood
pledged in writing to vote for Mr. Grant
Mr. Burnettâ Did he give you any rea
son why he believed that those parties
would support Grant?
A. That they were pledged.
Q. Simply that?
A. Yes.
Mr. MelTickâ Did he toll you why they
signed a written paper of that kind?
Q. He did not. You must remember
gentlemen, that at that time I was look
ing over the entire ground in order to
make up my judgment as to what my
duties were toward my constituents with
reference to the person for whom I should
vote for United States Senator. I was
not committing myself to any candidate,
nor to his friends, and was. therefore,
not taken into very much confidence.
Mr. Burnett â Now. you .said that you
had received information that a certain
amount of money was put down into Mr.
Boone'B districtâ slsoo. Where' did you get
that information?
A. I did not so state, Mr. Burnett.
Q. What was your statement?
A. As I remember it I heard After I
came here that money had been sent into
Mr. Boone's district.
Q. How did you hear that?
A. 1 was trying to recall that to my
mind. I think that It was by intimation
ana not by direct statement.
Q. Do you Know from what source It
came?
A. 1 was trying to recall that, too. It
was several d;iys ago and my mind has
been full of very many things since that
time. My imi >ression isâ and it is only
an impressionâ that either Assemblyman
Dale or J. W. VViley, attorney of Bakers
field, who was .bere far some time, said
to me, "Do you know that our people"â
they were friendly to Grantâ "assisted in
your tight?" N ow, 1 cannot tell you,
gentlemen, that t,V)se were the men, be
cause there were numerous Grant men
talking to me, all the time insisting that
it was my duty tcÂ» vote for Mr. Grant,
because 1 was the only man in the Sev
enth Congressional District that was
standing out against him; and which one
of those numerous rr.ven that were insist
ent on that point it would be im
possiblo at this juncture for me to tell
you.
(j. One reason that they gave why you
should vote for Grant was because
Grant's money had gone into your dis
trict and assisted in yrrur election?
A. That was the question exactly. "Do
you know that our people assisted you in
your fi^ht?" My answer to that was that
"if they did it was without any consulta
tion with me, and I don't feel myself
under any moral obligation to vote for
Mr. Grant, therefore. I like to be con
sulted by neople that desire to assist me
in my lights." Anu that was my uniform
answer whenever a question of that kind
was raised.
Mr. Baconâ l want to 1 ask the chairman
if I could be permitted to cross-examine
Mr. Cosper with reference to his state
ments about Grant's campaign?
Mr. Mollick â So far at' 1 am concerned,
if he If willing.
The witnessâ l desire to say this further,
gentlemen, at this juncture that Mr.
Grant and none of Mr. Grant's friends
have asked me to vote fcr him in consid
eration of any assistance that they have
given me. That is fair to Mr. Grant. If
they insisted they did not use that as an
inducement to me further than what I
have stated to you from these outside
men, and I do not know a thing about
their authority to speak for Mr. Grant or
Mr. Green. It was a matter so foreign to
my liking that 1 did not cure to pursue
the thing and did not pursue it.
' Mr. Baconâ May I ask you some ques
tions, now. Mr. Cosper?
A. Certainly.
Q. Mr. Cosper, I believe in your direct
examination or in your direct statements
prior to any mention of Mr. Grant, you
said that no candidate and no friend of
any candidate had ever made any offer
to you of anything, of any consideration,
either of patronage, money or influence,
to secure your vote for any man for
United States Senator?
A. I think it amounts to that.
Q. And that nobody had solicited your
vote for United States Senator, giving as
a reason for it anything improper?
A. I do not know that I said that, but
I think that is true.
Q. You have also said just now that you
did not know whether or not these
people that had talked to you about
money having been put in Mr. Boone's
campaign were friends of Mr. Grant or
not?
A. I do not know that I said that.
Q. Boone's district?
A. But I knew they were friendly to
Mr. Grant's candidacy; but I said that I
did not know that they had any author
ity to speak for Mr. Grant or Mr. Green
in the matter.
Q. And you do not remember who It
was?
A. Not with definiteness, no, sir. I have,
given you my best impressions, or given
the committee, rather.
Q. Do you enjoy being examined in an
inquiry of this kind. Mr. Cosper?
A. Oh, Mr. Bacon, I am apt to take the
world as it comes, and I will take this
with the rest of It. It Is not particularly
unpleasant to me.
Q. It is not?
A. No.
Q. You enjoy It, then?
A. Well, I do not know why you should
assume it.
Q. Well, you say it is not unpleasant.
Mr. Mellickâ l do not think that is
proper.
A. It is a matter of indifference; solely
a matter of indifference.
Mr. Mellickâ That is hardly a proper
question.
The witnessâ You ought to know, Mr.
Bacon, that I did not invite it nor did I
avoid it.
Mr. Baconâ Certainly; I understand
that. Now, Mr. Cosper, usually to the
ordinary man it is a very unpleasant
thing. Is it not?
A. I am not sure what you would con
sider an ordinary man.
Q. A man with keen sensibilities, with
respect to his name and standing in the
community in which he lives.
A. I think there are a great many or
dinary men who would not be so keenly
sensitive.
0.. You think there are?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Then that is probably the reason that
you connected the name of some Assem
blyman with a rumor of having made a
statement and you cannot remember
whether he was the fellow that made it
or not?
A. I am not responsible for your pre
sumptions, Mr. Bacon.
Q. Well, I am just trying to get at your
reason for making that statement,
A. Mr. Bacon, I am under oath. I am
asked to give these things, and it Is my
duty to give them as nearly as I can. I can
not say positively, and so clearly indicated
it to this committee that I could not say
positively, that either of the gentlemen I
have named was the gentleman who made
that statement to me. You ought by this
time to have understood that fact.
Q. I do understand that, sir. I under
stand that you made that statement.
A. I would not voluntarily bring the
name of any man into a transaction of
this kind, but I cannot avoid my responsi
bility under oath. I would not if I could.
Q. Now, then, you say that no one con
nected with Mr. Grant has ever made any
Improper proposal to you with respect to
your vote?
A. I say that not only of that individual
but of all individuals.
Q. Then why did you detail this state
ment that you had just made here, that
you were solicited to vote for Mr. Grant
because Mr. Grant's money had possibly
helped to elect you?
A. I did not so detail nor so state.
Q. Did you not say that somebody had
said to you that you probably ought to
vote for Mr. Grant because you were
under obligations possibly to vote for Mr.
Grant.
A. I did not and the record does not so
show.
Q. What Qoes it show in respect to that?
A. I shall have to ask for the written
record to tell you exactly, but I know
that that was not the truthâ the form of
the statement.
Q. Now, with respect to Mr. "Wiley, if
it was Mr. Wileyâ l do not know who it
was, but if it was Mr. Wiley â will you
please state to this committee what Mr.
Wiley said to you?
A. I have stated it as near as I can re
member it, and my best memory of my
former statement Is this, and of what ha
said is this, if he be the man, and I do
not say that he was: Upon urging me
to vote for Mr. Grant because I was the
only man in the Seventh Congressional
District In this Legislature that was
standing out against Mr. Grant he said,
"Don't you know," I think was his lan
guage, "that our people -assisted in your
fight?" I think that js the way I stated
it and I think that is the way It was stat
ed to me by this Individual, whoever he
may be.
Q. Would you consider it wrong if they
had assisted In the munner Indicated by
him?
A. That would depend upon circum
stances. I think it was very possible that
money might be legitimately expended in
such a fight as I had, because I had a
large fusion majority to overcome. I do
not feel that all expenditures of money,
even in large sums, may be Illegitimate
in the promotion of a political campaign
by any means. I very much doubt that
any money sent into that country for the
assistance of the political campaign was
at all improperly used, but it is a matter
of doubt and not of knowledge.
Q. As a matter of fact you do not know
whether there was any money sent In
there or not?
A. I do not. It was not sent to me, at
any rate.
Q. What I want to get at, Mr. Cosper,
is this: You would not regard it as being
improper if that money had been sent in
there, especially under the circumstances
detailed to you?
A. You put that as a question, I sup
pose?
Q. Yes.
A. The answers that I have madeâ
Q. Just wait a minute.
A. Very well.
Q. Then what I would like to know is,
why, when you were examined by the
gentlemen of the committee and asked
if you knew of any Improper proposals
being made to you, you coupled the name
of ah Assemblyman with this statement
if it is immaterial?
A. Because, as I remember, I was di
rectly asked to do that very thing. It
was not at my solicitation, nor have I
made any voluntary statements. j,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1899.
Q. But, when being asked whether or
not you knew of any proposal of such
kind being made, you said you knew of
none whatever, and being asked to spe
cify you stated this one.
A. I cannot trust your memory, Mr.
Bacon.
Q. Well, is that the fact?
A. I do not understand it. I shall have
to refer you to the stenographers' notes
on those things.
Q. Well, the stenographers' notes would
not govern this question as to whether or
not that is a fact. Mr. Cosper.
A. State the proposition again, then.
(The reporter read the question.) I do
not think that I did that.
Q. You did not mention the name of an
Assemblyman?
A. Not in that connection; no, sir. That
is a misconstruction of the examination.
Mr. Baconâ That is all.
Mr. Burnett asked that a subpena be
issued for M. H. de Young, and also |
that a subpena be issued for J. D.
Spreckels and W. F. Herrin. After a
lengthy discussion it was finally deter
mined to Issues subpenas for those gen
tlemen, but at the request of Mr. Mellick
the matter was deferred until to-mor
row morning.
Mr. Mellick called the attention of the
committee to an article contained in the
Los Angeles Times, signed by C. B. I
Washburn, containing a charge that a
legislator had been offered $3000 to
make Bulla his second choice, but
spurned the offer, and asked that a sub
pena be Issued for C. E. Washburn to
appear before the committee and tes
tify. A motion was made to that effect,
seconded and carried.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Chairman and gentle
men, you will remember that when this
investigation commenced I made some
little objection to the investigation taking
as broad a scope as it has taken. In my
judgment the investigation should at this
time â or at that time my judgment was
that the investigation should be limited
to the incident that prompted it, namely,
the investigation of the charge against
Mr. Howard Wright. This committee
overruled those objections and concluded
to go into this thing. A great many
times during the course, of this in
vestigation it has been remarked by
the chairman and various mem
bers of this committee that they
were desirous of securing suggestions
from anybody that would lead to knowl
edge of improper influences having been
brought to bear upon members of the
Legislature with respect to their Senato
rial votes, and, in fact, that question has
been asked of nearly every witness for
the last two or three days. Now I have
not been on the witness stand, but I have
heard these questions. 1 have been illâ
in fact almost too "ill to be present a part
of the time I have been here, but I have
begun to make some investigations my
self, and, with your permission, would
like to have you subpena some witnesses,
gentlemen, I desire to say to start with.
I don't know when you will adjourn to
and I do not know who the first witness
will be, but it seems to me, gentlemen,
that you are posing before this State in
a position that will soon make this in
vestigation a very peculiar affair, in this:
That it has apparently been directed
against one man. This afternoon a news
paper man is put upon the stand, and I
do not think that the trends of the testi
mony up to the time that Mr. Cosper was
put upon the stand can be misunderstood
or misconstrued by anybody that heard
it. Mr. Brown was put upon the stand
practically to pprve noticeâ or his testi
mony did practically serve notice â that
the libel suit between The Call and the
Speaker of the House had probably been
compromised and settled.
Mr. Burnett â Now, Mr. Chairman, I am
opposed to this kind of argument, and
trust if he has any suggestions as to any
evidence or any witnesses that might be
likely to throw any light upon this situa
tion, I am perfectly willing, so far as I
am concerned, to take it.
Mr. Baconâ l will stop that, then, Mr.
Anderson. The Speaker pro tern. of the \
House was in here yesterday and was ex- I
amlned. not at great length, and I asked j
to be excused from cross-examining him I
on account of my ill health and that I |
might be allowed to recall him. I would
like to have Mr. Anderson recalled, for 1
the reason that Mr. Anderson detailed a j
conversation that was had between him
self and Mr. Benjamin, and upon that
conversation basod a prejudice against
Mr. Grant. The testimony of Mr. Benja
min as to what that conversation was
is different from that given by Mr.
Anderson. I want to inquire of Mr. An
derson how â with that in his mind against i
Mr. Grant, one of the most prominent can- i
dtdates for the United States Senate in
this raceâ he would presume to appoint a
committee to hear and Investigate
charges of corruption with respect to any
man who was a candidate for the United
States Senate? I want to say this, fur
ther: That I would object at this timeâ
I think it is unseemly for this committee
to put Mr. D. M. Burns or Mr. U. S.
Grant or any other Senatorial candidate
upon the witness stand, for the reason
that I do not remember of. an instance in
the testimony of any of the witnesses in
which a direct charge has been made
against any of those gentlemen that they
had knowledge of the improper use
of money, influence or anything else, with
respect to the vote of a single Assembly
man in this House. So, why should you
lower the character of your investigation
â why should you attempt to lower the
standing of the men who are candidates
for United States Senator, one or two of
whom seem to have very good chances
for election here, by calling thorn upon
the stand to refute charges that are not
made? On that account I object at this
time to the introduction of the testimony
or to putting Mr. Grant or Mr. Burns or
any other Senatorial candidate upon the
witness stand.
Now, I heard another rumor to
day that I would like to Investigate.
I have heard there w^s a certain gen
SAN FRANCISCO'S CHARTER
IS BEFORE THE GOVERNOR
Passed the Senate by a Unanimous Vote Without Debate,
and Only Awaits the Governor's Signature
to Become Law.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19.â The San Francisco
charter has now passed both branches of
the Legislature, and of the 120 members
of the Senate and Assembly, but one lone
and solitary Assemblyman could be found
to oppose it. That Assemblyman was
Grove L. Johnson of Sacramento.
As far as legislative action is concerned
the charter is now disposed of, for it was
finally adopted in the Senate this morn
ing.
When the charter came up In that body
Senator Wolfe moved that It be referred
to the' San Francisco delegation.
Senators Cutter, Curtin and Sims vig
orously opposed the proposition of Sena
tor Wolfe on the ground that as the peo
ple of San Francisco or a majority of them
have approved of the charter it was clear
ly the duty of the Legislature to ratify
that action.
Senator Davis of Amador, who is one
of the most impressive speakers on the
floor of the Senate, opposed the motion
in a most vehement speech, during the
course of which he said:
"It does not^make the slightest differ
ence to us what the San Francisco dele
gation thinks of this charter. Whether
they favor it or whether they oppose It
Is to us a matter of perfect indifference.
The Senate needs no command or man
date from that delegation as to what
It should do with regard to this charter.
The Senate cannot amend the Instrument,
tleman in this State who had a friend
that was in the House, and that that
friend made a proposition, or made a
statement to another gentleman, that
this friend of his in the Legislature
had been offered $6000 for his vote
for a certain gentleman who was a
candidate for the United States Sen
ate, that he did not want to vote for
that man, but, should he vote for
anybody else, he thought he was en
titled to receive the same amount as
he would receive should he vote for
that other man. I desire a subpena
for Mr. C. Q. Lamberson.
Mr. Lamberson said, as I under
stand it â I may be misinformed. Ido
not know anything about it myself,
personally. It is just like a lot of
other things that have been floating
around here; but this statement was
made to me in this way: That Mr.
Lamberson said that this friend had
been offered $6000 to vote for a can
didate for the United States Senate.
Mr. Burnett â Where is Mr. Lambereon?
Mr. Baconâ l think he is in Visalia.
The chairmanâ He is an attorney re
siding at Visalla.
Mr. Mellickâ Some man here told you
that, you say?
Mr. Baconâ l heard this on the street
several days ago, and I could not tell you
who told me.
The Chairman â Who is that friend
that you referred toP
Mr. Bacon â That friend was Oos
per, and I desire Mr. Lamberson sent
for.
Mr. i-iellick â To prove what?
Mr. Bacon â To deny or prove the
truth, of the rumor that Mr. Cosper
said to Mr. Lamberson: "I have been
offered $6000 for my vote for a Sena
torial candidate. I do not want to
vote for that man, but if you believe
some other Senatorial candidate will
pay as much I would rather vote for
somebody else; but if I do I ought to
receive the same amount of money as
I would get if I were voting for this
other man."
Mr. Burnettâ How much foundation Is
there for that rumor? What foundation
is there to it?
Mr. Bacon â I was told some time ago
that there was a gentleman in this town
ânow I cannot give the names at all; I
do not remember .a single one of these
namesâ but I was told that a gentleman
telephoned from this town to Visalia.very
recently, to Mr. Lamberson and asked
him if that statement was true and he
said it was.
Mr. Burnettâ Do you know who it was
that telephoned?
Mr. Baconâ No, sir, I do not. I do not
remember any of those things, because
just as these gentlemen have testified to
day, they go in one ear and out the other,
so far as the names are concerned. I talk
to a hundred men every' day about this
Senatorial situation.
Mr. Burnettâ Some one told you that
some one had telephoned from here down
there?
Mr. Baconâ Yes, sir.
Mr. Burnettâ You do not recollect who
it was that told you?
Mr. Baconâ No, sir, I do not; but I
know It made a very vivid impression on
my mind.
Mr. Burnettâ Did you know the man or
was he a stranger?
Mr. Baconâ The man that told me? Oh
I think I did; yes, sir. I must have.
Mr.. Burnettâ You have forgotten, have
you?
Mr. Baconâ Well, I have not forgotten
him. lam Just exactly in the same posi
tion as these other witnesses who nave
testified.
Mr. Burnettâ Why not tell us who it is?
Mr. Baconâ Well, I say I cannot. I told
you in the start that I could not.
Mr. Burnettâ Well, I would favor issu
ing a subpena for Mr. Lamberson, in
asmuch as his name has been connected
with two or three matters.
Mr. Mellickâ l do not see any use in
sending for him. Mr. Bacon starts out
with the proposition that there is no use
of subpenaing Colonel Burns, Mr. Grant
and different ones; and here Is a man
way down in Tulare County that has
heard something, or has said that per
haps Mr. Cosper was offered this money
by one of these principals. Why not get
the principals here?
Mr. Baconâ Now, Mr. Mellick, the first
day of the committee, or the first session
of the committee, I made that same sug
gestion, and you gentlemen overruled me.
Mr. Burnett â I move you, Mr. Chair
man, that a subpena be Issued for Mr.
Lamberson of Visalla.
Mr. Sanfordâ ln view of the fact that
the $1500 transaction has been referred to
In reference to Mr. Lamberson, I think
that It is only proper that we should is
sue a subpena.
Mr. Baconâ About the $1500â1 do not
know anything about it. I never heard of
it until I heard of It to-day. All I am
speaking about is that matter I spoke
about a moment ago. I will say this-
That my understanding of the statement
Is that Mr. Lamberson said that Mr. Cos
per had been offered $6000 to vote for Mr
Burns; that he did not want to vote for
Mr. Burns. I do not want to use the
names of these gentlemen. Mr. Burns so
far as I know, possibly is an honorable
gentleman. He Is a gentleman that is
It must be adopted or rejected as a whole.
The people of the city of San Francisco
have approved of this measure and their
wishes should be respected by the Legis
lature. There is not a member on the
floor who was elected In 1898 who Is not
pledged to vote to approve this charter,
and we should vote to approve it without
delay."
Senator Simpson of Los Angeles also
favored the proposition to vote to approve
the charter without further reference or
delay.
Senator Smith of Kern County an
nounced that he favored the charter, but
If good reasons could be given why It
should be referred he was willing to vote
to do so.
Senator Wolfe finally simplified mat
ters by withdrawing his motion to refer.
He explained that he had opposed the
adoption of the charter by the people of
San Francisco, but when the question
came up in the Senate he thought that he
would be "tempted" to vote to ratify It,
even though only by a narrow margin a
majority of his constituents had voted in
favor of the charter.
The vote was then taken on the ques
tion of ratification, and thirty-five Sena
tors voted aye. After the result had been
announced Senators Hoey and Feeney en
tered and requested that they be record
ed as voting aye, but President Flint
ruled that this could not be done. So re
ally the charter had thlrty-aeven Bup-
Dortera^.wlth three Senators absent.
very prominent in this State, and I do
not want to bandy his name around with
anything of this kind. Mr. Grant is just
exactly in the same boat.
Mr. Mellickâ Do you wish to have him
here for the purpose of impeaching Mr.
Cosper's evidence?
Mr. Baconâ No, sir. I do not think that
the impeaching of Mr. Cosper's evidence
cuts any figure in this case. What you
want to know is' whether that was ac
tually done.
Mr. Cosper's evidence was that Mr.
Green said he had never said this on the
street.
The chairmanâ No; Mr. Cosper's evi
dence was to the effect that no such offer
was ever made, as well.
Mr. Baconâ Yes.
The chairmanâ l consider that vastly
more Important to this committee than
whether Mr. Green had said anything con
cerning me personally.
Mr. Baconâ Now, we want to find out
what Mr. Lamberson says.
Mr. Mellickâ As I understand, Mr. Lam
berson says that Mr. Cosper says so.
Mr. Baconâ No, sir; he
don't say anything of the
kind. He says that Mr.
Cosper sent him up here
to make this proposition.
Now that is a direct,
flat-footed charge, gen
tlemen, and it seems to
me if you want to inves
tigate anything now is
the chance. Mr. Lam
berson said that Mr.
Cosper told him that he
had been offered $6000

A Disappointed Lobby Fails to Thrill With
a Sensation.
Scandals and Investigations So Change Conditions
That Prophesying Turns Out to Be
Bad Business,
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19.â This morning Milton
Green was to have appeared at the bar
of the Assembly and either answer a
question, or, according to general belief,
be sent to Jail for contempt. He did not
appear, a,s the stenographic notes of the
committee had not been written up, and
the only showing made by it was a re
quest for stationery. This was readily
granted.
There were more people present than
usual, for the spectacle of a man in the
act of being grilled is something which
attracts. I do not see why it should, for
to me there is nothing more distressing
than to see a man writhing on the wit
ness stand, piled with questions which he
can only answer at the cost of the repu
tation of himself or his friends.
In my letters from this city I had pre
dicted without prejudice the election of
Grant, and it is a matter of regret to me
as an amateur prophet to have to accept
the view that he is out of it. Possibly
this is a mistaken view. Grant still leads,
but after the showing that his money has
been given to candidates for the Assem
bly, a circumstance attested by Green,
acknowledged by Wright, I cannot see
how Grant has a shadow of a chance. I
have been unable to see from the first
how there was any chance for Burns.
Therefore I confess to being utterly in the
air and everybody else is. Bulla gained
a few votes and the glad hand, still the
goal is so far in advance of him as not to
be in view. Barnes gained a vote. These
facts may be significant or not. For my
part I do not at this moment believe that
at the day of adjournment there will have
been a Senator elected.
Howard E. Wright received $1600 of
Grant money through Milton Green. Both
of them have acknowledged this under
oath, and both of them had denied it In
conversation with newspaper men. This
was the allegation of The Call, and it waa
substantiated by the principals. This pa
per had also stated that Wright had
promised to vote for Grant. For verifica
tion it is only necessary to scan the testi
mony of Wright himself, for if ever a
man was convicted out of his own mouth
Wright is the man. There is a point that
the committee should make clear. Green
testified to having been told by a friend
that Wright was going to Burns
for money and that he intercepted him
and supplied the money. But ne would
not tell the name of this friend. I do not
see how he can avoid doing so. Green
has repeatedly said that he had no apol
ogy to offer for the use of money among
prospective legislators, because none of
it was in the nature of a bribe nor for the
purposes of corruption. If this is the
fact the friend concerned witn him could
not be jeopardized in reputation by the
fullest statement. The friend our-y to be
willing to take the stand and tell how he
knew Wright was going to Burns for
money, and there seems to be no reason
why Green should object to his dointr so.
It must never be thought there is any
Pleasure in writing a truth whion hurts,
n the contrary itls often a painful duty.
The truth has been told and it has deeply
wounded. There are threats in plenty,
which mean only that sore spots have
been touched. As a citizen of California I
would be glad to record that the contest
for the Senatorship was clean and honor
able. To do so is Impossible. Throughout
it runs the taint of fraud, intimidation,
Regardless of anything the committee
may formally conclude, regardless of the
possibility of the whitewash, I am con
vinced that the methods of the Grant
management have killed Grant. This
leaves Burns next. His followers are
hopeful, having looked upon Grant as tho
chief obstacle in their way. But I do not
see them demonstrating the strength.
They talk'about it freely, but where is It?
Last night I said I believed the Assem
bly committee of investigation was a fair
and honest body. The satisfaction of say
JUSTUS S. WARDELL
RETAINS HIS SEAT
CALX, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19.â Justus S. Warden will
retain his seat in the Assembly as rep
resentative of the Thirty-ninth District.
The contest of Leon Jones before the As
sembly Committee on Contested Elections
came to an end this evening and the com
mittee will recommend such a course.
Chairman Cosper did not join in the con
clusion reached by the members of the
committee, as he had not attended Its ses
sions, owing to the necessity of his being
present at the investigation of Speaker
Wright. He said he intended going over
the ground covered by the committee, and,
if satisfied with the law in the premises,
would vote with the majority.
Ex-Assemblyman Frank Powers, attor
ney for Leon JonVs, appeared before the
committee and argued earnestly in favor
of his client. He stated that waiving
technicalities Mr. Jones would have won
to vote for D. M. Burns;
that he did not wish to
vote for Burns, or^that
he would just as soon
vote for Mr. Grant, or
words to that effect, or
if he did he thought he
ought to have the same
amount of money as if
he voted for Burns. Now
there is a flat-footed
proposition, gentlemen,
and you can investigate
it or not, as you choose.
A motion was made that a subDena
be issued for Mr. Lamberson. seconded
and carried, Mr. Mellick voting no.
Mr. Mellick-I would just l ike Dtl to * a >
this: That I think you gentlemen ha\e
gone off half-cocked and I want to with
draw from the committee I don t want
anything more to do with it. I made a
motion to reconsider the vote when the
motion was carried to subpena those
other gentlemen, the next time we met,
and filed my motion. -.-intort
Mr. Burnett-Mr, de Young has printed
a statement that D. M. Burns has ex
pended $14,000 of railroad money to elect
a railroad candidate. I understand he

ing so still remains, and I hope It will
to the end. That an embarrassing task
has fallen to it there can be no question,
and to emphasize the ignominy of the
presiding officer of the Assembly must
strike all the members as something they
would rather avoid. The session this af
ternoon was interesting, and while fully
set forth in the news columns some of
the salient features may not be out of
place here.
Two Call reporters, Messrs. Burke and
Levings, were the principal witnesses.
When Levings told about having heard
the rumor that Cosper had offered to vote
for Grant for $6000, this having been the
figure expected from Burns, there was
a bit of a sensation. It must not be un
derstood that any weight is to be at
tached to any rumors, and no man can
be so grounded in the confidence of his
fellows as to escape them. Neither can
any afford to Ignore them, and Cosper will
not. Nevertheless, as chairman of the
committee, the surprise must have been
little less than a shock. He will be given
full opportunity to refute Itâ an oppor
tunity which he would doubtless demand
were this necessary. The man said to
have acted as messenger between Cos
per and the Grant camp has been sub
penaed and Cosper has made oath that
the charge is unfounded.
Mr. Burke corroborated the allegations
that Wright had admitted having receiv
ed Grant money for which no note was
exacted, and that Wright had threatened
to have the representatives of this paper
expelled trom the floor unless they dis
continued the habit of exposing his meth
ods.
The testimony of these gentlemen seem
ed to have great weight, and the hints
they offered materially widened the pos
sibilities. There stretches before the com
mittee a field, the limit of which cannot
be surmised. The work in sight promises
to consume as much time as the election
of a Senator, and, perhaps, adjournment
will find it incomplete. The only tangi
ble result thus far is the discrediting of
Wright and the elimination of Grant as
a factor in the situation, and as to the
latter there Is an element of speculation.
The other is a certainty, as nothing the
committee could do would restoreWright.
The charter has been saved. Charles
L. Patton and others have been here and
devoted noble efforts to its salvation. It
was never In the least possible danger,
sentiment for it being unanimous except
as to Assemblyman Johnson of Sacra
mento, whose objections were just strong
enough to control his own vote. Howev
er, Patton and the others showed their
good will and loyalty, and had a good
time. They have gone home now proud
and happy at having snatched the charter
from defeat.
Senator Boyce's remarkable resolution
is on its way to where twineth the wood
bine. Already it had been shorn of its most
eccentric features, its stuffing knocked
out. and by the time it comes up fox final
action the author will not be able to re
cognize his own handiwork and thus will
mourn but moderately over its defeat. The
idea of Boyce seems to be that newspaper
men in their quest for information must
not disturb the repose of the diplomats
composing the Legislature. There are
plenty in the Senate who take a broader
view, among them Dickinson, Shortridge,
Braunhart and Morehouse; yet I have
seen all the gentlemen roasted, Indeed,
have myself taken a friendly fall out of
them. They are too big to resent the
criticism which must come to those in
public life, or to think themselves mem
bers of a superior class. Perhaps Boyce
has not gained much by putting himself
on exhibition.
While the Assembly was waiting this
morning for the sensation which never
came. I listened to proceedings so Inter
estedly as to fall asleep. When Major
Kyle gets to reading a bill his voice lulls
a "tired world to rest.
To-night the Grant men are holding a

out by four votes and, further, that If
the committee insisted on technicalities,
his client would have been seated by a
majority of eight votes. Mr. Powers
quoted authorities from the Supreme
Courts of various States and advised the
committee on the legal phase of the- con
test, but without avail. Assemblyman
Hanley replied to Mr. Powers' arguments
and the committee then voted in favor of
Mr. Warden.

BILLS BEFORE THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.â The Assem
bly's Judiciary Committee transacted a
large amount of important business at its
session to-night. It not only recommend-
cd for passage Mr. Meserve's bill reduc
ing the number of Superior Judges in
San Bernardino County to one but also
recommended the passage of Assembly
bill No. 149, which, if successful, will
amend the Code of Civil Procedure In
reference to appeals to the Supreme
Court from interlocutory judgments in
actions to declare what are deeds and
what are mortgages. Bill No. 132 was also
recommended for passage. It provides for
the satisfaction of mortgages which have
been foreclosed.
Delegates from the Horseshoers' Asso
ciation appeared before the committee in
support of a measure Introduced by Sena
tor Taylor in the upper house of the Leg
islature and Mr. Cobb in the Assem
bly, which has fnr its object the licensing
of horseshofrs and compelling members
of the trade to pass an examination be

Cobb addressed the committee at length,
as did also P. W. Cnmmins, State presi
dent of the Master Horseshoers' Associa
tion, and president of a San Francisco
council, and Mr. Johnson, a member of

Mr. Oommins pointed out the import
ance of the proposed enactment and â¢ v

;.-'. Only two votes were taken this morn
. ing. The Investigation committee wanted
to break away as soon as it could to re
sume its examination of witnesses in the
P Wright scandal, and there was a good bit
of other committee work pressing. Bills
are weeks behind, and the file work is
barely started, so when the motion was
put for adjournment no one objected, and
further balloting is deferred to to-morrow
noon.
Now that the floaters have got started,
there is a good aeal of surmise as to
where the rest of them will cast their lot.
Thomas R. Bard holds on to the two
votes he has been honored with from the
start. John Rosenfeld has one to donate,
Irving M. Scott is in line for the booby
prize with still another, and there are a
couple of Democratic votes figured on for
some Republican candidate, though they
are claimed at present by the Grant I
. people. .

GRANT'S FORCES WILL STAY
WITH HIM A WHILE
'; :. ' 'ATI*. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
, ' MENTO, Jan. 19.â Ulysses S. Grant's re
... maining hope of Senatorial success !is
. ' â¢rooted in the dishonor that has this week
: --come upon him through his unholy flnan
â â¢â¢â  rial connection with Howard E. Wright.
'.. . Speaker of the Assembly. To-night would
.â  - : have seen him deserted by all save four
. of the twenty-eight votes he musters had
â¢ -it not been that his adherents feared to
â¢. .â¢ desert him before the report of the in
. vestigating committee is rendered.'
â¢ â¢ â  "The boys thought It would look as
.'. though we were all getting out from
â¢under if we shook him right now, when
, there is h popping." said one if his
â trusted lieutenants just a few minutes
ago, "though 1 can't see how we can win
htm out now."
He had just come down into the office
of the Golden Eagle from Mr. Grant's
headquarters, where for three-quarters of
an hour he had been in red hot caucus
with twenty-three others of the Grant
faction. Thai caucus was the crucial test !
of the Gran strength, and, thanks to such '
a combination of unclean circumstances as |
probably no other candidate to the United
. Pi a";- Senate has ever faced, he will be
able to -control his strength for. an in- ;
definite period, and by the decision of to- I
. night's caucus he will hold it intact. The
'â â¢.' .deadlock is practically assured.
Ail through the past stirring weeks i
â " -Grant's forces have been on the brink of
â¢ mutiny. The string to which has dangled |
. -his meager bunch of votes would have
' been snapped ere this if it could have been
: ."dÂ«pided into whose outspread toga the
â¢ â¢ votes should fall. Yesterday the defec
' riot) was so near at hand that Bulla had
"â¢ "credited himself with seven Grant scalps,
arid.. General Barnes was making room
â¢on his belt for seventeen more. The four
remaining would have stayed with him
till he got back to San Diego. Assem
blymen Crowder and Works and Senator
Nutt and one other could not be swayed,
but the rest were looking for another
camp so long as it should not be Burns.
This morning came a hurried call for cau
cus Grant and Green: h^d come to a
knowledge of the smiles of Bulla and the
confidence of Barnes, and had learned I
the reason of it, and they lost no time in J
rounding up the flock.
It was no easy task, however, and a
caucus was only agreed to upon the con
dition that neither Grant nor any of his
strikers should be present. And to-night,
the caucus. Senators Jones of Orange
and Trout of Santa Cruz were not on
hand, but they sent in notes to say they
â would abide by any decision that might
be come to.
Assemblymen Dale of Kern and Works
of San Diego were also absent and. like
the others, sent in notes of acquiescence;
even Works had finally become disaf
fected and was willing the switch should
be made, if come it must.
There was a hot wrangle and a good bit
of speech-making for the better part of
an hour. A switch was Imminent, but to
whom to switch was the snag In the path.
There was no desire to elect the odorous
Burns. The leaders wanted to go in a
bunch to some one, and Thomas R. Bard,
the Ventura olive grower, was mentioned
more than once. But there were some
for Bulla and more for Barnes, and then
some spellbinder among them gave the
opinion that a switch at this time would
look as though they were getting out from
under possible charges of assistance in
campaign expense?, and, accepting the
suggestion as a compromise excuse.
Chairman Nutt was allowed to declare it
the st-nsf of the caucus that the forces
of the Southron stay with him until the
report of the committee that Is investi
gating his campaign finances Is in the
hands of the Assembly.
THREE STAR ATTRACTIONS I
FOR THE ASSEMBLY
.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 19.â There are three star at
tractions being arranged by the Judiciary
Committee of the Assembly for the 24th.
25th and 2Â«th of this month, and Chair
man Johnson has Issued invitations to
nearly every banker, jurist and preacher
of the gospel in the State to be present.
On the JMth the bill Introduced by Cobb
of San Francisco for the purpose of ex- j
emptlng all church properties from taxa- j
tlon cornea up for consideration, and the I
divines who have been Instrumental in
Its framing propose to be on hand to help
the committee with timely suggestions.
On the day following the jurists are In
vited to be on hand to consider with the
committee the constitutional amendment
introduced by Johnson, which has for its
object the creation of an appellate court I
in and for the Stat--> of California. Mr. \
Johnson's proposed amendment was |
drafted in answer to a prayer that has ;
been going up from the Supreme bench j
and from the legal fraternity for the past |
ten years, and that there may be no pos
sible" mistake that would later nullify it
he has called for a combination of the
legaJ brains of the State to consult with
him and the committee.
On the next day, the 26th. trust deeds,
or. rather, the abolition of trust deeds. Is
to be the consideration In hand, and the
bankers will be on deck to fight the bill
that is proposed to do away with that
handy instrument. The object of the j
author of the bill is to compel bankers to
make loans on straight mortgages in- \
stead of upon trust deeds, as at present, I
and as the average banker had rather I
have the trust deed as his security he is I
naturally forninst the passage of any en
actment that is aimed to abolish what
he considers his superior security.
SENATE PROCEEDINGS
IN THEIR DETAIL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 19.â The Senate this morn
ing was in the charter approving busi
ness. In addition to approving the San
Francisco charter a similar instrument
for the city of Vallejo was ratified.
Then Senator Boyce of Santa Barbara
had an inning with his resolution to make
it contempt of the Senate for a newspa
per representative to endeavor to ascer- j
tain the views of Senators on miasure3
pending before the Legislature tiurlag a
Senatorial session or on the floor of the
Senate at any time.
Senator Boyce's first endeavor was to
secure an executive session, but he could
not. Senator Smith wanted reporters ex
cluded only while the resolution was un
der discussion.
Senators Shortridge and Bulla vigorous
ly opposed the motion for any executive i
session. They both were of the opinion ]
that if the resolution was adopted the
public should know the reason the Sena- â¢
tors gave for its adoption.
Senator Boyce, noting Die fact that h!3 !
motion for an executive section was i
doomed to defeat, withdrew it.
He then proceeded to make his speech j
in advocacy of the adoption of the reso- !
lution. He took a stand against yellow
journalism and what he was pleased to ;
term the effort of the newspapers to run j
the Legislature by buttonholing memb^is I
and attempting to ascertain in advance |
how they intended to vote on pending'
bills. By this means he thought newspa- !
pers endeavored to commit Senators on i
legislative matters before they had had !
due and proper time to consider them.
Senator Braunhart took a stand in fa- |
vor of giving the press every facility to
obtain information which it sought and !
he was opposed to the Boyce resolution
He had himself been the victim of bitter I
abuse at the hands of the newspapers,
but he was a great believer in the prin
ciple of the freedom of the press.
aerator Davis stated that he could see !
no need for the passage of any such res- j
oiution as the one pending. * The press
had not abused its privileges. When it i
did then was the time to act.
Senator Bulla proposed two amendments :
to the resolution which had the effect of
striking out all reference to newspaper
employes, managers or proprietors. "The !
resolution would then exclude all parties i
from annoying Senators by polling them," i
said Senator Bulla. "It is really the lob- ,
bylsts who bore us most."
Senator Doty of Sacramento vigorously
opposed both the resolution and amend
ments. Said he:
"I am always willing that my constitu- i
ents here in Sacramento shall come to me '
at any time and question me as to what j
they wish me to do, or what 1 am going
to do. I respect the press, and some of 'â 
the Senators are altogether too 'touchy* !
about these matters. I have no rea.so'n
to complain of the press of Sacramento
County, and I do not believe any Senator, ;
as long as he Is in the riglit, has any I
reason to fear the press of California, for !
I believe that generally the press means I
to do right."
Senator Davis favored Senator Bulla's
amendments, as they would take away I
any offense to the press, and would pro
tect Senators from lobbyists.
Senator Simpson thought that the press
had been allowed altogether too much â¢
freedom. At one time the Legislature had i
been referred to by the press as the
'"Robbers' Roost." He favored the reso- !
lution.
Senator Morehouse, in speaking on the l
resolution, in substance said: "Anybody!
can ask me at any time now I intend to
VOtÂ« on any bill. I will answer him oÂ»- :
not, as I see fit. But Ido not think any- t
body should bf permitted to' Interfere
with sessions of the Senate. The news
papers cannot hurt me, and I have no
ill feeling against any newspaper and only ,
against one newspaper man. I think ;
there should be an exception made in the '
law of murder, so that I could be per- |
mltted to kill this man, and It would be
only justifiable homicide. I refer to the I
managing editor of the Examiner. He is |
unfit to live."
Senator Shortridge took a strong stand
against the. resolution.
The hour of noon having arrived the
further consideration of the resolution
went over. First, however. Senator
Bulla's amendments were adopted.
Abolition "of "the~Blacklist.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA-!
MENTO, Jan. 10.â The bill Introduced by i
Assemblyman Sanford of Mendoeino j
f'ounty. which has for its object the abo- }
lltlon of the blacklist among employers, !
has been favorably reported by the As- '
sembly Committee on Labor. Mr. San- \
ford's bill makes it illegal for any epi- !
plover, either individual or corporation,
to blacklist any of his employes, and pre
scribes a heavy penalty for a violation of
the law. It is drawn along the same
lines as the Utah law, which has, by the i
Supreme Court of the United States, been |
declared constitutional. Mr. Sanford was !
requested by the officers of a number of
labor unions, particularly unions of rail
road employes, to introduce this measure |
and will endeavor to secure favorable
action upon it in both branches of the I
Legislature. As he is a hard working i
member, has had the benefit of previous |
experience in the Legislature and is a
good talker the bill has excellent pros
pects before it to pass both Assembly
and Senate.
Confirmed by the Senate.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 19.â The Senate
confirmed these nominations: Joseph H.
Choate. New York. Embassador to Great
Britain; C. H. Brickenstein, Surveyor of
f'uFtnms. Denver, Colo.; B. F. Booth,
Postmaster at Brigham, Utah. Also a
number of promotions in the army.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, *1899.
GERMANY WILL NOT
BE PERMITTED TO
GOBBLE UP SAMOA
While the Philadelphia Hurries to Apia
the Kaiser Will Be Asked to
Disavow Consul's Action.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â The
Washington correspondent of
the Herald telegraphs: Unless
Germany promptly disavows the
action of her Consul at Apia
there is reason to believe that a
joint note will be presented her
by the American and British
Governments requesting such
disavowal. It was expected,
when Freiherr Spreck Yon Stur
burg, secretary of the German
Embassy, called upon Assistant
Secretary Hill at the State De
partment to-day, that he had
come authorized to make a sub
stantial disavowal of the German
Consul's act, but his call was, I
am told, merely one of inquiry.
Embassador Pauncefote also
called at the department, but the
officials are reticent in regard to
what passed between him and
Secretary Hay. I understand,
however, that the American and
British consular representatives
in Apia will continue to act to
gether. I hear, on the authority
of a diplomatist here, that the
three powers are acting in har
mony in Samoa, and that if the
German Consul has acted in the
manner indicated his action will
be promptly disavowed.
It was learned to-day that
about a month ago, anticipating
trouble, Germany directed its
representatives here to request
the State Department to issue in
structions to the American of-
ficer in Apia to co-operate with
the German and British Consuls
in preserving the peace. The re
quest -was complied with. I was
told at the German Embassy that
nothing had been received re
garding matters in Samoa, but it
is denied positively that the Ger
man Government is endeavoring
to stir up trouble. I understand
that the German Government,
some months ago, agreed to the
removal of Herr Raff all, German
! President of the Municipal Coun
cil of Apia, upon the representa
| tion of this Government, and last
i November instructions were sent
i to him from Berlin directing him
!to leave Apia, How he happens
i to be mixed up in the rebellion is
! a question which the German
| Government is expected to ex
plain.
Before making any representa
! tions to the Berlin Government
; Secretary Hay has cabled the
American Consul at Auckland in
; structing him to communicate at
i once with Consul General Os-
I born at Apia and direct that of-
I ficer to make a full statement of
the situation, with such facts
bearing upon the course pursued
I by the German Consul as he may
! deem important.
Secretary Hay received a dis
: patch to-day from Consul Gen
' eral Osborn. It announced that
j the decision of the Justice in
: favor of Malietoa Tanua had
l caused the adherents of Mataafa
I to rise in rebellion, and that the
j former's forces had been defeat
} cd. It is also stated that the
three Consuls had signed a pro
clamation recognizing the Ma
taafa party's provisional govern
| ment pending instructions from
| their Governments. This action
I on the part of the American rep
; resentative will be disavowed by
this Government. Protests have
been made by the British and
American Consuls at the action
| of the German Consul in violat
ing the Berlin act.
The dispatch also related to
I the hostile attitude of the Ger
man Consul, and this information
caused a great deal of apprehen
sion in official circles.
In view of the situation, Secretary
Hay requested Secretary Long this
morning to order the Philadelphia to
Apia
The vessel will go by way of

have taken no action to increase
their naval forces at Apia.
COMMODORE KAUTZ
RECEIVES NO ORDERS
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 19.â The United
States flagship Philadelphia, with Com
modore Kautz on board, arrived here
this morning from Acapulco.
Up to a late hour to-night Commo
dore Kautz had not received any or
ders to proceed with the Philadelphia
to Samoa. He' said that the paint on
the bottom of the flagship was very de
fective, pealing badly during the re
cent southern service, and leaving the
plates exposed. lÂ£e therefore believes
that unless matters are extremely
critical at Apia the vessel will be or
dered to go into drydock at Mare
Island. Upon arrival here Commodore
Kautz received instructions to await
the arrival of a chief engineer, who has
been ordered from Havana to join the
ship here. The former chief has been
condemned by a medical board. It is
therefore expected that unless contrary
orders come the Philadelphia will re
main here about a week. She will then
proceed to Mare Island.
THREW THE GERMAN \
CONSUL OUT BODILY
LONDON, Jan. 19.â A special from
Auckland. N. Z.. says:
The British and American Consuls
were compelled to force the doors of the
Supreme Court at Apia, Samoa, in
which the German Consul had estab
lished himself, and to push, him into the
street.
All parties at Apia, the special dis
patch continues, unite in condemning
the German Consul for the fighting
which has taken place between the
rival Kings. It is pointed out that, in
violation of all agreements, the Consul
accompanied Mataafa's force when the
claimant invaded the town and en
couraged the opposition to Malietoa
Tanu.
When the British and American Con
suls were informed as to the situation
they adjourned the court and locked the
building:. The German Consul then de
manded the keys and they were refused
him. He then broke open the doors, re
moved the locks and replaced them
with others. He afterward brought the
German Municipal President into the
chamber and the latter went up on the
balcony and shouted to the British and
American marines assembled on the
square:
"I am the Supreme Court. lam the
Chief Justice."
The crowd replied with Jeers and the
GENERAL EAGAN IS
DULY NOTIFIED AND
RELIEVED OF DUTY
Commissary General Succeeded
by Colonel Davis Pending His
Trial by Court=Martial.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â General Eagan was served with legal
notice of the ordering of a court-martial for his trial just before the
close of office hours to-day. This notice was delivered by the messenger
of the adjutant general in the usual course and had the effect of reliev
ing General Eagan of his duties as commissary general of the United
States army, pending the conclusion of the court-martial. The office
was placed in charge of Lieutenant Colonel George B. Davis, who has
been on duty there for some time as assistant to General Eagan.
It was said at the department that the text of the charges and speci
fications upon which General Eagan is to be tried will not be made pub
lic by the department, but will be placed In the hands of the Judge ad
vocate of the court-martial, Colonel Davis, and the court itself may give
them publicity.
British Consul demanded the keys of
the building, which were refused.
A Scotchman named Mackie there
upon climbed on top of the building and
hoisted the Samoan flag, while the Brit
ish and American Consuls and a num
ber of marines invaded the building,
forced the doors open and pushed the
German Consul into the street.
Then the two Consuls formally and
legally, according to the special dis
patch, opened the court and issued a
warning against any further interfer
ence with its Jurisdiction, threatening
to arrest and imprison any one at
tempting to do so.
THE ENGLISH FEAR
CRISIS IN SAMOA
LONDON, Jan. 20.â The Times, in a
special article this morning with refer
j ence to affairs in Samoa, after point-
I ing out that when the Central Amer
ican Ship Canal is completed, the pos
! session of Pago-Pago harbor, incom
: parably the safest in the entire Pacific,
; will become a world-important ques
â  tion, says: "The decision of Chief Jus
j tice Chambers that the Berlin act dis
! qualified Mataafa must be accepted
with considerable resreve, for that act
! expressly reserves to the Samoans the
I 'free right to elect their King and to
| choose their form of government.'
' This right has been well recognized by
the three powers.
"The part the United States have
played in the matter must be eonsid-
I ered in connection with President Mc
; Kinley's last message to Congress. It
I must not be forgotten that these islands
! were, so long ago as 1872, a cherished
I object in the eyes of American cx
i pansionists, and even now Samoa is a
word to conjure with throughout many
Western States. The present situation
will not be devoid of benefit if It serves
to convince the three powers that the
Berlin act requires immediate and radi
i cal amendment, in default of which Sa
] moa will always be liable to become the
i prey of civil war and a source of
anxiety to the signatory powers. It
may even be, as was nearly the case
ten years ago, the theater of hostilities
between two of their number."
CHAIRMAN COSPER
GETS CAUGHT
Continued from First Page.
Charles Lamberson, the chairman of
the Republican Committee of Tulare
County, came to the rooms of Mr.
Green and Mr. Grant in the Golden
Eagle Hotel and requested a private
interview. That interview he secured.
Mr. Green and Mr. Lamberson were
in consultation for quite a time. Mr.
Lamberson informed Mr. Green that
his friend, Assemblyman Cosper, had
told him that he (Cosper) had been
offered a $6000 gift to vote for Colonel
Burns, and Cosper told him that he did
not feel as though he could vote for
Burns, but if he voted for Grant he
thought he should receive like con
sideration.
Mr. Lamberson told his story, and it
is related that Mr. Green in a rather
forcible way informed Mr. Lamberson
that he (Green) was not bribing any
legislators to vote for any man for
Senator, and then Mr. Lamberson,
without further suggesting anything,
withdrew.
On Sunday last Assemblyman Cosper
stated that he believed that it was his
friend Mr. Lamberson who had put this
story in circulation, for he knew posi
tively of one man he had told it to.
But when Mr. Cosper was Interviewed
by a reporter of The Call on Sunday
last and asked as to the truth^f the
story above related he did not^iccuse
Mr. Lamberson of telling it. In fact he
denied absolutely that he had ever
heard of it until the reporter detailed
it to him.
Mr. Cosper must have known of the
story at that time for a short time
thereafter he accused Mr. Lamberson
of telling it. The Call reporter never
mentioned on Sunday the name of Mr.
Lamberson to him. In fact, the re
porter did not know that Lamberson
had ever made any appeal to Mr. Green
in behalf of Mr. Cosper and therefore
never used his name in the Sunday in
terview with Cosper. Thus it would
seem that when Mr. Cosper informed
The Call representative on Sunday that
he was entirely Ignorant of the story
afloat that a man had gone to Mr.
Green and claimed that he (Cosper)
had been offered $6000 to vote for Burns
and that if he voted for Grant he
thought he ought to receive similar
consideration he forgot Charles Lam
berson and the story he was telling to
that effect.

Insurrection on the Islands of
Mindanao and Zebu Grows
Rapidly.
MADRID, Jan. 19.â The War Office has received a dispatch from
General Rios, in command of the Spanish troops in {he Philippines,
concerning which the officials maintain the greatest reserve. The
dispatch also announces the departure of Spanish troops homeward"
and says the situation at Manila is unchanged. Still, according to
these advices, the insurrection in the island of Mindanao against the
Americans is growing rapidly. Various Mohammedans are there and
fanatics are scouring the country, preaching a holy war. It is further
asserted that the island of Zebu is in full revolt.
Premier Sagasta announces that the Queen Regent will sign a de
cree convoking the Cortes the following day after the receipt of the
news of the ratification of the treaty of peace by the United States
Senate.
DIDN'T TALK FOR
ADMINISTRATION
Senator Foraker Makes
Explanation.
Special Dispatch to The CalL.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The Senate
listened further to-day toadiscussionof
the policy of expansion. Turner of
Washington delivered a carefully pre
pared speech on the Vest resolution.
The speech was for the most part a
constitutional argument, in which Tur
ner took issue with Senator Platt and
Senator Foraker upon their recent ut
terances.
At the conclusion of Turner's address
Foraker took some sharp exceptions to
statements made in the speech, espe
cially those referring to him person
ally. He explained at length the na
ture of his statements, declaring that
he had spoken only for himself and

CANAL RIGHTS
ARE CONSIDERED
Maritime People Before
the Committee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The Mari
time Canal Company, representing the
old concession for building the Nica
ragua canal, had a hearing to-day be
fore the Commerce Committee of the
House. The Maritime Company was
represented by its president, Hiram
Hitchcock; the president of the con
struction company, J. W. Miller, and
the solicitor of the company, A. T.
Mason. Professor Haupt, one of the
Nicaragua Canal Commission, was
present to discuss engineering fea
tures involved, and Hon. Warner Mil
ler, former president of the Maritime
Canal Company, was also present.
President Hitchcock took up the or
ganization of the Cragin-Grace syndi
cate and stated that his understanding
was that, owing to discouragements,
the syndicate had dissolved prior to the
time when the contract for the cences
sion was secured. He declared that
the last concession was in violation of
the rights and interests of the Maritime
Company and of the United States Gov
ernment.
Stewart asked Hitchcock if the com
pany had gone into this plan with a
view of unloading it on the Govern
ment.
Hitchcock answered positively in the
negative. There had never been such i
a purpose, he said. The finances of the j
company and the amount of cash it had
actually spent was inquired into mi
nutely by members of the committee;
also the relations between the Mari
time Company and the construction
company. The latter had spent some
thing over $4,000,000 and the Maritime
Company something over $1,000,000, out
side of certain stock and bond trans
fers.
Hitchcock said if the Government
took up the work he believed the com
pany could retire such stock and bonds
as were outstanding, except that held
by Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
"What do you think of the Panama
canal in its effect on your canal?"
Hitchcock was asked.
"I am told by eminent engineers who i
have examined the subject that it will i
cost $400,000,000 to complete the Panama \
canal," he said, "and when it is com- i
pleted it will be inoperative, for the |
reason that it will be impossible in |
certain seasons to control the summit
level and operate the locks."
Professor Haupt said the essential
point was to secure immediate action
under existing concessions, in order to
avoid dangerous complications which
would postpone and possibly defeat the
entire canal project. He said the j
Panama canal could be completed if 'â 
enough money were furnished. But he
said it made a route 450 miles longer !
between the northern terminals, and
the amount of canal work was double |
that of the Nicaraguan route.
Mason, attorney for the company, I
gave the legal phases, arguing that the
present concession was in full force.
Fitz Ready to Fight Sharjsey.
TOLEDO. 0.. Jan. 19.â Robert Fitz-
Blmmona to-night issued a long state
ment in which he scores O'Rourke and
Sharkey and offers to arrange a match
with the latter if he will sign articles
within two weeks. He says he will
waive a finish fight, but will insist that
the articles call for a fight of twenty
five rounds or more. He will bet as
much side money as his opponent
wants.
Wants a Big Guarantee.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â Peter Maher,
the heavyweight pugilist, to-day re
fused the offer of the Lenox Athletic
Club to make a match with Jim Jeffries
unless guaranteed a $20,000 purse, al
though Jeffries, through his manager,
jiccepted the proposition the club made.
amendment offered by Allison was
adopted. It provides that the Secretary
of the Treasury shall not pay out for
â work on the canal more than $20,000,000
during any fiscal year. Earnest ef
forts were made to amend the meas
ure in other particulars, but all failed.
THE HOUSE CONSIDERS
POSTAL APPROPRIATIONS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The House
to-day practically decided the Brown-
Swanson contested election case from
the Fifth Virginia District in favor of
the sitting member, Ransom, a Demo
crat, by declining to consider the case.
Twenty-four Republicans joined with
the Democrats and Populists on this
vote.
The postofflce appropriation bill was
then taken up. The greatest surprise of
the day was the adoption of two
amendments striking out of the bill the
appropriation of $171,000 for the fast
Southern mail and $25,000 for special
mail facilities between Kansas City
and Newton, Kans. This appropria
tion for the Southern mail has been
fought annually for six or seven years,
but has always been retained. The in
crease in the appropriation for the
pneumatic tube service, from $225,000 to
$300,000, was knocked out by the elimi
nation of the provision which fell un
der a point of order for the repeal of
the law against the extension of this
service. The House adjourned with a
motion to recommit it pending. The mo
tion carried instructions to strike out
the words "newly acquired territory"
in connection with an appropriation of
$300,000 for mail facilities in Porto Rico,
Cuba and the Philippines

THE EXAMINER FOR BURNS.
THE Examiner of yesterday, with its usual stolid
persistence, in an editorial distorted by blisters
of big letters and black type, repeats its oft-told
lie that The Call, before the election, knew that the
railroad was not sincere in its avowed withdrawal
from politics. There is no dolt in the State so stupid
as not to know that this is a deliberate concoction of
ibc socialistic organ, which, after having been unmer
cifully thrashed in 1896 and IS9B, and having had its
views of expansion contracted almost to extinction,
now desperately struggles for some kind of recogni
tion. We know it to be a lie as respects The Call,
and we also believe it to be a lie as respects the en
tire Republican press of the State, that the candi
dacy of Dan Burns for the Senate was even suspected
before the election. The firm and uncompromising
attitude of that combination of journalistic power
against his candidacy, the moment it was re
vealed and the shadowed hand of the railroad thrust
into the fight, was a demonstration of that fact.
Judging, however, from the sneaking aid that Dan
Burns has received from the Examiner, that paper
may have been better informed. The number of
righteous men in the Legislature would indicate, also,
that it was only in a few instances that the true rail
read purpose was even tacitly understood. The rail
read has always had its creatures in the Democratic
and in the Republican organizations. Of this the
Examiner, with all its froth and splutter, is fully and,
as many think, solidly aware.
The Examiner editorials suggest the answer to a
question once proposed by a youth to an experienced
exhorter: "What do you do when you are preaching
and can't think of anything to say?" The clergyman
teplied. "I just holler." And its substitution of ex
pansionists and corruptionists for Washington and
Jefferson fills the description of that class of states
men by the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, "Their
names go clattering down the corridors of time like
a tinkettle to a dog's tail."
A CONTINGENT FUND STEfJL.
THE Republican majority in the State Senate, in !
one matter of legislation at least, has adopted |
the motto of the Austrian statesman who ex
claimed, "After me the deluge."
It is quite evident that these Senators do not un
derstand the nature of their responsibilities, or they
have concluded that this is to be their last appear
ance on any stage and that it can make no possible
difference what sort of a record they leave behind.
They have passed a bill amending the Bclshaw law by
*thic!i they have added some $200 a day to the ex
penses of the Senate. With the prestige of a unani
mous Republican vote in the upper house this bill |
has gone to the Assembly, where a majority of the j
Republican caucus has declared in its favor, and a I
party combination has passed it to third reading, j
About the same amount of expense has been added to j
the Assembly.
Thus we have a Republican Legislature amending |
a law which enforces economy in its own expen- |
ditures so as to add $400 per day to the burdens of '
the tax-bearers during the legislative session.
The course of the Republican majority in this mat- !
ter is indefensible, for it appears that it has been
adopted solely for the purpose of making more places '
for the hangers-on of the Senators and Assembly- 1
men. The patronage created will without doubt be I
used to promote the Senatorial prospects of some
body and to put bills through the Legislature con
taining appropriations.
It is a clear case of conspiracy to further public
plunder. If the Republican party is to permanently i
succeed in this State all such raids as this must be i
abandoned. If the Governor signs this bill after it j
has passed the Legislature he will stultify himself and j
deal a blow to his party from which it will not soon
recover. Governor Gage said in his inaugural mes- !
sage that the great demand of the present time is for I
economy in the administration of the government, i
How can he sign this steal without admitting that
economy is for everybody except the legislative i
jobbers?
We confess deep disappointment at the course
which has been pursued by the Republican majority j
in the Legislature upon this subject. We have no I
doubt that the same disappointment will be ex- i
tperienced by thousands of Republicans throughout j
the State. There can be but one result to such legis- j
lation â political destruction.
The following of Daniel Burns
Is marked by unexpected turns;
For, don't you see? O, cursed spite!
That Wright is Wrong and Wrong is Wright.
Chairman Cosper of the Assembly investigating j
committee has a large opportunity, but whether
he is large enough to grasp it is not an absolute
certainty.
The tenor who has been arrested for porch
climbing was merely following his instinctive inclina
tion toward the high seize.
THE NEW CHARTER.
WITH the virtually unanimous vote given in
both houses of the Legislature for the charter
San Francisco reaches a resting-place in what
has been a long, vexatious and costly struggle. For
a time at least we are to have no more new chartc
agitations, elections and expenses. Upon that re
sult, if upon no other, the city, the voters and the tax
payers can be congratulated.
It is not to be expected, even by the most sanguine,
that the new charter will prove satisfactory in every
respect when put into operation. No set of men, not
even the heaven-sent statesmen who framed our na
tional constitution, ever succeeded in drawing up an
organic law that was found so perfect it did not need
amendment. Our charter may require revision in
many places to make it a good working system of
municipal government; and, furthermore, it is to.be
remembered that now that the people, the Assembly
and the Senate have approved it, there remains the
Supreme Court. That high tribunal may see fit to
drive the proverbial coach and six through it at the
first opportunity.
Under any circumstances, however, we are not
likely to have the expense and the work of making a
complete new charter imposed upon us again for a
long time to come. Such alterations and amend
ments as experience may show to be desirable, or as
the Supreme Court may require, can be made one by
one as each emergency arises. We have our charter
and we are now to go forward and use its powers
and provisions as best we can for the improvement of
the administration of the city in all departments of its
work.
For the prompt manner in which the charter was
taken up and approved the thanks of the citizens are
due to the Republican majority in the Legislature,
who, having control of the business of the session,
gave the charter the right of way and acted upon it
with dispatch as well as with a due regard for the
wishes of the city. This creditable action at the out
set promises well for the work of the session, and
there is now good reason for believing that as soon
as the Senatorial contest is out of the way the Legis
lature .vill deal with public business in a way to merit
the approval of the people and make a notable record
in the way of good work well and promptly done.
(\ STRONGER LAW NEEDED.
ONCE more the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion, in its annual report, complains that the
law under which it acts is inadequate and de
fective and asks that it be amended. It begins the
report of its work during the past year with the
statement that the law in its present condition can
not be enforced, and that "until further and important
legislation is enacted the best efforts at regulation
must be feeble and disappointing."
Proceeding to more definite statements of the evils
resulting from the defects of the law the report says:
"Tariffs are disregarded, discriminations constantly
occur, the price at which transportation can be ob
tained is fluctuating and uncertain. Railroad man
agers are distrustful of each other, and shippers all
the while in doubt as to the rates secured by their
competitors. The volume of traffic is so unusual as
to frequently exceed the capacity of equipment, yet
the contest for tonnage seems never relaxed. Enor
mous sums are spent in purchasing business and
secret rates accorded far below the standard of pub
lished charges. The general public gets little benefit
from these reductions, for concessions are mainly con
fined to the heavier shippers. All this augments the
advantages of large capital and tends to the injury
and often the ruin of smaller dealers. These are not
only matters of gravest consequence to the business
welfare of the country, but they concern in no less
degree the higher interests of public morality."
Considerable space in the report is given to a re
view of facts brought out by investigations made by
the commission during the year. These cover a wide
range of subjects. Secret rebates were given on
some roads, secret freight rates on others, one tur
pentine company was discovered to have constructed
a large number of oil tank cars with a capacity of
6500 gallons and certified that they held 6000 gallons,
and thus had 500 gallons carried free on each car
load, and another railroad company was found to be
carrying coal for large coal interests at less than its
published rates.
These instances serve to show the nature of the
violations of the law, and the commission is power
less to prevent their repetition. A considerable
6pace is given to a statement of the results of traffic
associations and the arguments of the railways in fa
vor of forming pools for the purpose of fixing freight
rates and thus eliminating the "competition which
leads to discriminating rates for large shippers. The
commission does not approve of the pooling arrange
ments, and declares if they are to be permitted they
should be made under governmental supervision and
every part of the contract should be open to public
inspection.
The issue is one of the most important before the
country, for, as the report says: "No one thing does
so much to-day to force out the small operator and
build up trusts and monopolies, against which law
and public opinion alike beat in vain, as discrimina
tions in freight rates." The commission makes a
clear case in support of their claim that the present
law is defective, and Congress should cither amend it
or abolish the commission and put an end to the pre
tense of railroad regulation.
A VISIBLE REMEDY.
r\ CCORDIXG to the Philadelphia Inquirer the
/ \ rapidly increasing wealth of the East has de
; vcloped "a very difficult situation to meet, and
J the remedy is not visible." This difficult situation is
| that capital has become superabundant, investments
are scarce, interest rates are falling, and, as the In
quirer says, many people who have been living in
comfort on their incomes when their capital yielded
6 or 7 per cent are now seriously embarrassed by the
decrease to 4 per cent or less.
Such is the difficulty for which Eastern experts can
see no visible remedy. The Inquirer says hopelessly:
"We may go into the ocean carrying trade and give
employment there to millions; we can develop Cuba,
and perhaps the Philippines; we may even venture
into South America; but these ventures must be made
slowly, and any relief that would come to the con
pested money market would come slowly. But evi
dently our financial leaders will have to branch out
into other countries and seek new fields of investment,
for good opportunities in the United States are ob
viously getting scarcer."
It is one of the strangest features of this new era
that so many intelligent journals in the Eastern
States are repeating that sort of thing. It is a folly
akin to the stupidity of crass ignorance to assert that
good opportunities for investment in the United
States are getting scarce, and that our capitalists must
go to the West Indies or the Philippines to find in
vestment.
The whole of the Greater West, and vast regions of
the Southern States, are hardly half developed, and
abound with resources of every description. In Cali
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1899.
fornia alone there are opportunities for the building
c f railroads, the opening of mines, the irrigation of
lands and the establishment of factories, every one of
which would yield a certain profit if judiciously con
ducted.
It is narrated that Turner, in reply to a question
from an admirer of the wonderful brilliance of color
in his pictures, "With what do you mix your colors?"
answered, "With brains, sir." Our Eastern capital
ists can profit by the answer if they are wise and en
terprising. If they will mix their capital with brains
they will find plenty of investments for the com
bination.
Of course if men wish to live idly in New York or
Philadelphia, to dawdle around clubs and golf games
and draw interest while doing nothing, they must con
tent themselves with small incomes from their cap
ital; but if they will come West and get the inspira
tion of Western energy into them and set to work at
the great task of developing the resources and diver
sifying the industries of the country they will soon
find plenty of opportunities.
In fact, the prospects for investments anywhere on
the Pacific Coast, and particularly in California, were
never better than now. However difficult the situa
tion m.ay be for capitalists in the East, the remedy
is visible if they will only look West for it.
IS BRYON c LEADER?
COLONEL WILLIAM J. BRYAN talked his
way to the leadership of the Democratic party.
For the subject of his faculty for talking he
chose a question that is purely scientific. Everything
concerning a standard of value and the natural laws
that work in the circulation of money or its represen
tatives in currency is purely a matter of science. In
reference to a standard of value, and a single stan
dard, for there can be but one, the first scientific con
clusion was reached in 1366 by the French phil
osopher, Oresme. He demonstrated that if many
standards of value exist, represented by money or
currency of different intrinsic value or purchasing
power, that of the least value obsoletes and drives out
of circulation, use and effect upon the volume of cur
rency all of greater value.
In 1526 this subject was re-examined by Coper
nicus, to whom we owe the discovery of the true
structure of the universe with the sun as the center of
our planetary system. He knew nothing of Oresme's
conclusions, but by a purely original examination
reached entire agreement with them. In 1558 Sir
Thomas Gresham, an English philosopher, re
examined the whole question, subjecting the reason
ing of Oresme and Copernicus to every possible test,
and affirmed their conclusions. In 1697 Sir Isaac
Newton and John Locke again subjected to the tests
of science and experience the question of a single
standard of value and the conformity of all other
money and currency thereto, and affirmed the con
clusions of Oresme, Copernicus and Gresham.
It is true that Copernicus merely discovered the
truth of the Heliocentric theory, one of the mightiest
achievements of the human intellect, while Sir Isaac
Newton discovered the law of gravitation. John
Locke gave to religious liberty and toleration its
philosophical foundation in his "Essay on the Human
Understanding," and his studies drove him into exile
in Holland, where he found the same atmosphere of
tolerance and reason that had refreshed the intellect
of Descartes, Spinoza, Erasmus, Grotius and Bayle.
He withstood Stillingfleet and Sergeant in philosophi
cal controversy, and brought everything to the test of
science. None of these students and philosophers dif
fered on the issue that Colonel Bryan has made in
American politics. They knew scientifically that what
the French called "le double etalon," and Henri Cer
nushi named "the bimetallic par," and Colonel Bryan
calls ''bimetallism," could not exist. They knew that
only one standard of value is possible, and they
knew, further, that a common necessity present in the
affairs of all civilized men, working its way through
natural selection, would establish such standard.
They knew that if statute law established two stan
dards, bimetallism, each with equal function and legal
tender power, but varying in actual intrinsic value in
the market, the less valuable would obliterate and
obsolete that of greater value, and thus become itself
the single standard.
Colonel Bryan stands opposed to this conclusion
of science and opposed to the philosophers who from
1366 to this date have affirmed that conclusion.
It is interesting to note his method of discussion, in
contrast to their reasoning. He addressed the Bi
metallic League of Denver on the i6th inst. and stated
his case in this form: "The American people favor
bimetallism, never mind where the silver is produced.
Those who advocate the gold standard as a rule know
that the gold dollar is not stable nor honest. Every
goldbug denies this, however, and it is this denial
that gives me an evidence of his insincerity. You
ask me why the gold standard is wrong? Because it
i.- a system of grand larceny, perpetrated upon mil
lions with no other purpose than to rob them."
Surely a great party has pitifully fallen when it has
declined to the leadership of a man who in such
phrase discusses a scientific subject.
Since he asserted Democratic leadership the in
herent judgment and capacity of the American peo
ple for self-government have been shown in the re
pudiation of his party. In that time the Democrats
have lost eighteen seats in the Senate, and in the next
Congress there will not be a single straight Demo
cratic Senator from a Northern State. The party has
even broken in the South, and eight Republican Sen
ators come from that section.
Mr. Bryan's leadership has routed his party, and
it can have no survival as long as he stands at the
front chewing his tongue at philosophy and science
and hurling such expletives as "grand larceny and
robbery" into the arena of scientific discussion.
Germany must not get the notion that she is su
preme in Samoa or the business of war-lording will
develop realistic features more striking than the wear
ing of a uniform.
Johnson of Sacramento, in the act of trying to kill

Ship captains are now complaining that
the weather has gone to the other ex
treme. Last week it was blowing- so hard
they had to heave to their vessels. Yes
terday it was almost a dead calm and no
headway could be made at all. Early in
the morning there was quite a fleet off
the heads, and those that refused assist
ance from the tugs did not reach port
until this morning. The ship Sintram
from Puget Sound, the bark Andrew
Welch and barkentine Planter from
Honolulu and the lumber schooners Laura
Madsen, Charles R. Nelson, Mizpah and
North Bend were all in a bunch at one
time, but they soon scattered. The An
drew Welch and Planter were out twenty
days from the islands, and each captain
was anxious to make port first in order
to win the race. The bark was the first
picked up by a tug and she beat the
Planter in by nearly an hour. The cap
tain of the Sintram accepted a tow late
in the afternoon and his vessel was an
chored before sundown.
The British ship Buckingham put into
Rio de Janeiro yesterday leaking badly,
according to a dispatch received by the
Merchants' Exchange. No cause for the
leak was given, but the chances are that
the vessel was caught in very heavy
weather off the Horn and was badly
strained. The Buckingham left Tacoma
â¢for Queenstown on October 21 last. She
has on board 91.165 centals of wheat,
valued at $101,000, shipped by Balfour,
Guthrie & Co.
The wrecked steamer Noyo, which is
now discharging at Main-street wharf,
very nearly capsized yesterday. Too much
lumber had been taken off the starboard
side and the vessel began to list to port.
Luckily, the mooring lines held her up,
but the lonereshoremen lost no time in get
ting on the wharf. The wrecking scow
Cataline was pressed into service and the
Noyo was fastened to her in such a man
ner as will prevent her from turning
turtle. As soon as the lumber is out an
attempt will be made to patch up the
wrecked vessel from the inside. It this
can be done it will obviate the necessity
of putting her on the mud fiats and save
a lot of expense. As soon as the holes in
the hull have been plugged up the Noyo
will be pumped out and put on the dry
dock.
I'nion-street wnarf has been pronounced
unsafe by Chief Engineer Howard C.
Holmes of the Harbor Commission, and
no vessels will be allowed to dock there

Every housewife who lives on the eleva

LEAF TOBACCO.
The Ireasury Department Defines the
Meaning of Cases and Bales.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch's of
fice received from Washington yesterday
the following communication on the
much-disputed matter of the sale of leaf
tobacco: â¢
This office has received your letter dated 23d
ult., Inclosing one from Deputy Collector
Neustadt, dated the 13th ult., relating to the
sale of leaf tobacco by qualified dealers in
quantities in less than the original package â
that is, in quantities running five pounds up
to twenty pounds. The question presented,
whether dealers who rehandle, assort and re
prise their tobacco are at liberty to construct
their own packages by placing a paper wrap
per or other temporary covering around the
tobacco, regardless of the quantity or as to the
manner In which It is repacked.
Section 69 of the act of August 28, 1894, pro
vides that every person shall also be regarded
as a manufacturer of tobacco whose business
it is to sell leaf tobacco in quantities of less
than one hogshead, case or bale.
This statute does not fix or determine the
size of hogshead, case or bale or leaf tobacco,
and for proper guidance we must look to the
customary commercial size of such packages.
No question will be raised as to the size of
hogsheads of tobacco. In Home States a hogs
head of leaf tobacco has been fixed by law and
decisions of court as low as 750 pounds and
as high as 1200 pounds.
A case Is universally held and defined to be
a box, chest or other receptacle complete in
Itself, in which it la Intended to cover or In
close any article which may be placed therein.
To case is to cover or furnish with a case
any material which it is intended to protect
and inclose.
A bale, as defined by Webster, Is a large
package prepared for transportation or storage
by pressing and confining the articles with
cords, gunny cloth, bands or elats, as a bale
of cotton, and as defined by the Century Dic
tionary is a large bundle or package of mer
chandise prepared for transportation, either in
a cloth cover, corded or banded, or without
cover, but pressed and secured by transverse
bands, wires or withes and longitudinal slats.
The chief articles of merchandise that are
baled are cotton, wool, tobacco and hay, and
the weight of the bale of American cotton is
between 400 and 800 poundn.
The office has recently investigated the ques
tion as to the size of cases and bales of im
ported Sumatra, Havana and other tobacco,
and finds that out of a large number of im
portations the smallest bale Is eighty pounds
while the largest Is 238.
The investigation as to the size of domestic
packages, hogsheads, cases or bales for heavy
plug tobaccos and light-weight domestic wrap
per and filler tobacco has not been definitely
concluded, but It is not anticipated that these
packages will fall short of the minimum
weight of the imported packages.
Dealers In leaf tobacco who do not rehandle
reassort or reprise their tobaccos must confine
their sales to original packages purchased by
them and are not permitted to retail tobaccos
from these packages.
Qualified dealers who do not rehandle, assort
and reprise their tobacco are required to repack
the same and hogsheads, cases or bales before
shipment or delivery to the purchasers; and
while they are not restrained as to the size of
these last packages they must bring them with
in the terms as defined herein relative to cases
or bales and are not permitted to take small
quantities of tobacco and enclose the same In
a. temporary wrapper of paper or other light
material for the purpose of selling, and delivery
of the same to any person. Neither have they
the right to break an original package pur
chased by them and retail leaf tobacco there
from, and are only permitted to break these
original packages for the purpose of rehandllng
reasserting and reprising the tobacco prepara
tory to Its sale to other qualified dealers or to
manufacturers, or to persons who purchase leaf
tobacco in packages for export.
Any quantity of leaf tobacco not properly
packed In a hogshead, case or bale, found out
side of a factory or the place of business of a
qualified dealer In leaf tobacco for sale, and
leaf tobacco in transit not properly packed,
will be subject to seizure and forfeiture pro
vided such tobacco is not in possession of the
person who produced the same.
There are no restrictions placed on the farmor
or grower; and he is not required to put up his
tobacco in hogsheads, cases or bales before de
livery, and can deliver the same by lall, vessel
or other mode of conveyance In such quantities
and in such packages, or loose in the hand,
as he may desire, and such tobacco will be ex
empt from seizure.
A distinction is made between the business of
selling leaf tobacco by sample and the busi
ness of selling samples, but incidentally, and as
necessary to his business, a dealer is permitted
to send out samples of his tobacco for the pur
pose of soliciting orders, which must be prop
erly accounted for both by the dealer and by
the person tn whom the tobacco is delivered,
and these samples will be exempt from seizure.

BELLE WEDS
AN ARMY MAN
Brilliant Nuptials of Miss
Kip and Dr. Guy Edie,
U. S. A.
/â VN 3SS ELIZABETH CLEMEN
/ I 1 TINE KIP and Dr. Guy
II Lewis Edle, U. S. A., were
1 married yesterday at noon at |
II Grace Church. This was the i
}â  \ first swell church wedding of
the season, and society was
well represented at the fashionable func
tion.
The bride is the daughter of TV. P. Kip,
and ever since she made her debut in the
world of society has been considered one
of the beauties and a belle of the exclu- |
Bive set. Dr. Edie has been stationed at I
the Presidio for the past four years, and j
is a popular officer and distinguished phy
sician.
Long before noon, the hour set for the
ceremony, the invited guests began to ar
rive. The church, with its pretty decora
tions of drooping vines, pliant ferns and
fluffy white chrysanthemums, was much â 
admired. The ushers, Captain John A. ;
Lockwood and Lieutenant Rutherford of
the Fourth Cavalry and Lieutenant i
Butner and Lieutenant Force of the Third
Artillery, were in attendance and found
seats for all.
Promptly at noon, to the strains cf the
bridal march from "Lohengrin," the
bridal party entered the church. First !
came the ushers, then the maid of honor, !
Miss Mary Kip, and lastly the bride, lean- I
ing on the arm of her father, W. P. Kip. !
Dr. Edie and his best man. Lieutenant
Harris of the Fourth Cavalry, met the
bride at the altar, where W, P. Kip Jr.
spoke the solemn binding words and
Bishop l.ichols pronounced the benedic- I
tion.
The bride wore an exquisite gown of
cream white satin. The corsage was .
high, finishing In a pleated stock of soft i
chiffon. The bridal veil, which fell into
the folds of the immense train, completed
the costume.
Miss Mary Kip wore a modish gown of
cream white bengaline. A large white
picture hat with nodding plumes was an
artistic accessory to the fetchy costume.
After the church ceremony the bridal
party and a limited number of invited
friends assembled at the Kip residence on
Eddy street, where a bridal breakfast was
served.
Dr. and Mrs. Edie left last evening for
a southern bridal tour, and on their re
turn will reside at the Presidio.

On Interesting Questions.
At the regular meeting of the board of

"Wednesday the committee of public af

counsel to assist the Prosecuting Attor
ney of the Police Court in the prosecution
of the poolsellers who had been arrested
upon warrants issued by the Police Court.
It was decided to ask the Legislature to
pass an act against the issuance and use
of trading stamps. The board decided to
send a communication to the Secretary of
War. asking for the return as soon as
possible of the First California Regiment,
now at Manila.
The Pacific Ocean Exposition to take !

SUICIDE NOT INTENDED.
Police Now Satisfied That John Mc-
Geough Was the Victim of
a Robber.
John McGeough, manager for Sullivan's
shoe store on Fourth street, who was
sent to the Receiving Hospital January
7 in a serious condition and not expected
to live, is on his feet again. Since his re
covery he has had a chance to give the
police an account of. his experience that
night, and they are now searching for the
ex-volunteer infantryman who la known
to have been in McGeougtTs comDanv
that night and who, the detective^ are
satisfied, cut him with the intention of
robbery.
The doctors at the Receiving Hospital
say that it is impossible for Alctreough
to have made the wounds himself- be
sides those who know him understand
there could be no reason for an attempt
at suicide, as he Is in a good position is
prosperous and of good family. There is
now no question that an attemet to mur
der him for his money or to do him great
bodily injury was made, and the detec
tives are hopeful of soon landing the
criminal.
The Loss of the Jewel.
An Inquiry was begun yesterday after
noon by Captains Bolles and Bulger into
the wreck of the steam schooner Jewel
on January 13 near Caspar. Captain
Madsen testified that the weather was
thick and he could not see the lights on
land, and that the vessel went aground
betore he was aware that he was near
the shore. The schooner was valued at
$25,000 and the lumber cargo at $12 'W0
The Investigation will be resumed to
day.

A NEW ASSOCIATION FOUNDED

! â
What Trade With the Philippines
Will Probably Do for at Least
One Section of the
City.
The North Central Improvement Asso
ciation, which was called into existence
i a short time ago for the purpose of im
proving that section of the city situated
| on the level north of California street
| and oast of Kearney to the bay, although
; as yet .n its infancy, is making rapid
j strides toward the accomplishment of the
â  main objects for which the association
. was foundtd. A meeting of the commit
j tee of five on organization, ways and
! means, appointed at the last meeting, was
i held yesterday afternoon, and the ne-
c essity for the rapid organization of the
j property owners in this section of the
j city and the furtherance of the various
! contemplated and needed improvements
j and other subjects were discussed.
It was decided unanimously to appoint
the following members of the new asso
ciation permanent officers, they being
merely selected at the last informal meet
ing to govern the society temporarily:
President, H. P. Sonntag; vice president,
George K. Fitch; secretary, Edgar
Pa'nter.
Tne birth of this improvement associa
tion is the outcome of the increasing
I trade between the United States (partic
i ularly California) and the Philippine lal
i amis and Hawaii. By the enormous In
crease of shipping that will necessarily
go to and from this city to the islands
It is absolutely necessary that something
should be done in the way of making Tfe
n< i . ssary preparations for the reception
and disposal of this Increased commerce,
as it will undoubtedly be unshipped en
that part of the water front within the
i/ . lundary lines indicated by the associa
tion.
In order to facilitate the disposal of
freight after it is landed good, smooth
roads and perfectly paved streets are
needed and will be demanded by the asso
ciation. Property owners along the wa
ter front will be requested to construct
adequate and appropriate buildings to
give place to the rookeries that are now
erected on their property. Other improve-
I ments similar in nature will be advocated
in the interior streets, and everything will
be done to put the entire section of the
city iii a presentable condition, so as to
meet the increasing demands upon it.
Property values, as a result of the ef
forts of the new association to improve
the general district, will advance and in
crease markedly. Although the work of
its members is simply a consequence of.
i an absolute necessity for immediate im-
I provement, it means much toward fur
< tht-ring a rapid growth in this entire sec
tion of the city.
The first general meeting of the asso
ciatiftn will be held in about ten days or
two weeks. It was decided to charge
property owners an initiation fee of $1, to
be followed with the payment of monthly
dues to the amount of 50 cents.

MR. HOBART WAS ALL SMILES
CAPTURED THE CUP ASTRIDE
DR. SHEPPARD.
Lord Marmion Easily Beaten by Op
ponent â Sokombeo No Longer
a Maidenâ A Mild "Kill
ing" on Merops.
There was nothing unusual about the
racing at Ingleside yesterday. The game
â was always an uncertain one, and the fact
that five favorites were dethroned no
longer causes any great amount of sur
prise. That Mr. Hobart's win of the gen
tlemen's race was not hailed with any
deep seated feeling of joy will
awaken no surprise. The methods re
sorted to by that gentleman reflect no
credit on himself nor on the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club.
Sokombeo began proceedings by taking
the opening six furlong sprint for mai
dens at odds of 6 to 1. He was ridden by
Charley Thorpe, and at the finish won
hands down from Sevoy, the staggering
favorite. Alhaja was a close third.
Miller & Blazer cut a good thing
Joose in the six furlong dash that follow
ed. They started their recent purchase
Merops; with Bullman up, and getting as
good as 6 to 1 the colt won cleverly from
Master Buck. Winifred, the favorite, fin
ished fourth, behind Potente.
Dr. Sheppard. with Walter Hobart up,
was a 1 to o chance for the gentleman i
rinrr race, and won galloping from Fer- j
rier.
Then came a six furlong spin, for which
Dr. Sharp went to the post favorite. The
Doctor made a fair bid for the purse, but
was downed somewhat handily at the tin- I
ish by Guilder, the second choice, well
ridden by Johnny Woods. Lady Britan
nic was extensively backed and managed ;
to run into fourth place at the end. All â¢
.of the others, perhaps, were possibly
â¢ not trying.
Again the talent fell in a heap over the
defeat of Lord Marmion. The brown
horse had a big pull in the betting on the
fifth event, also a six furlong run. but
was ingloriousiy beaten bj "Kid" Wel
ler'a Opponent. The latter was as good
as 4 to 1. and won eased to a walk.
The concluding number on the card was
a five furlong selling affair. Prince Ty
rant went over to the barrier favorite and :
was not among the first three at the end.
In a driving finish Heigh Ho led Eakins
over the line half a length, with Schnitz,
another outsider, third.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1899.
THE WINNER WON
A STORM OF HISSES
Hobart frets the Gentlemen's Cup but Not the Racing
Public's Favor.
Never probably in the history of the
American turf did a gentleman rider re
ceive the reception tendered Walter Ho
bart when he had won the deciding race
of the series of contests for the hand
some silver trophy offered by the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club. Winning from a field
of platers far below mediocrity, astride
the handicap horse Dr. Sheppard, he was
greeted after the finish by one lone flut-
Frank Skinner.
tcring handkerchief from the clubhouse,
and a thousand and one catcalls and
hisses from the grand stand. He went
direct to the clubhouse as soon as he dis
mounted, changed his clothing and then
left the track without seeing any one.
When the cup was offered by the In
glcslde association the conditions stated
that three times was the name of the
successful rider to be engraved thereon
before it became his personal property.
Tn the contests for the trophy Mr. Wal
ters was successful once, Mr. Dunphy
once, and twice had Frank Skinner fin
ished first, and on two occasions had Mr.
Hohart had the pleasure of finishing In
front. Once were the conditions of the
race distorted to suit the Increase in
avoirdupois of Mr. Hobart, and on that
occasion, to his chagrin, he finished sec
ond to Mr. Skinner.
The conditions of yesterday's race dis
BAY CITY CLUB
IS HOT AFTER
ITS TRADUCERS
Fahrbach on Games'
Amendment.
THROWS DOWN THE GAUNTLET
PROTESTS AGAINST UNFAIR
LEGISLATION.
Association President Nippert Should
Not Be Thus Embarrassed at
the Opening of His Ad
ministration.
The members of the California Asso
clatfd Cycling Clubs arc engaged in a
bitter internecine strife over two amend
ments to the by-laws proposed at the De
cember meeting of the hoard of govern
ors, one of which, the better of the two,
was passed at the January meeting and
will come up again on a motion to recon
sider at the February session.
The amendment which was beaten was
proposed by Secretary Scovern for the
Olympic Wheelmen and had for its ob
ject the requirement that every contest
ant in an association road race, except
the annual relay and twenty-miie events,
should be an Individual member of the
â  iation in good standing on its
books.
The amendment which was carried was
proposed by M. E, Games, chairman of
the delegation from Alameda, and com
bined the good features of the Scovern
amendment with the additional broad pol
icy that no exceptions be made; in other
word.s, that any member of the associa
tion could ride in any event, interclub or
otherwise.
The fairness of this latter clause bo
captured tho delegates at the last meet
ing that they carried the Games amend
ment by over a two-thirds majority, the
only ones against it being the four Olym
pic delegates. Since ti.it time the organ
of the Olympic Club Wheelmen has been
so bitter in its denunciation of the Bay
City Wheelmen because they voted In
favor of the Games amendment and
against the Olympic's pet scheme, the
in amendment, tnat President Emil
P. Fahrbach of the B*Â«y City Wheelmen
has thought best that the position of his
club toward the amendment should be
frankly stated to itie public and to the
members of the association in particular
in refutation of the unfair inferences that
have been cast upon his club and its dele
gates, simply because they supported the
Games amendment.
President Fahrbach has been an active
wheelman for over fifteen years He
joined the Bay City Wheelmen in IRB4. It
is unlikely that such an old-time devotee
of cycling would support any amendment
that he thought was injurious to the
sport. His letter is entirely free from
personalities and is a fair statement of
his club's position. It is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, January 19, 1899.
Cycling Editor The Call: Judging from the
various articles recently appearing In the daily
paper? in which Mr. Games 1 amendment was
termed a "Joker," it might be well to give the
same here in full so that the cycling public
can judge for itself.
The amendment as presented and voted on
at the last meeting of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs reads as follows:
"In all annual events promoted by the asso
ciation all contestants must be members In
good standing upon the Individual membership
Met otherwise they will not be entitled to
ride In such events. All amateur members of
the association may and shall be permitted to
compete In all races (whether open or interclub
events) held under the rules of the association,
and further, that all rules and laws In con
flict with this provision are hereby repealed."
As a matter of record, let me state that this
amendment was read in full at the December
meeting of the association. Judge, therefore,
my surprise to have it termed a "Joker" a
month later. How any one reading this amend
ment can term It a "Joker" is beyond my un
derstanding. Does It not particularly state that
all amateur members of the association shall
be permitted to ride in club events, and that
all rules to the contrary be rescinded?
Yet it appears from the statement of one
delegate that he only discovered the sense of
it after a delegate of the Bay City Wheelmen
Fpoke in Its favor. Immediately he arose In
arms against it, asserting that all paat legls
tinctly state: Mounts to be decided by
lot the day preceding the race. This did
not tickle the fancy of Blingum's petted
child of fortune, so he frowned and pout
ed, and acted as if he was "real angry."
So were all the chappies. How cruel it
would be to see "Wally" finish in the ruck
behind a bunch of plebeian bronco
busters!
So a meeting was called of the associa
tion and the conditions were altered. Al
though Fred Foster had promised Dr.
W. S. Hobart.
Sheppard to Mr. Skinner, he could not
resist the glitter of gold. His vow was
broken. Mr. Hobart secured the horse.
One thousand if he won, five hundred if
he lost, rumor has it.
Walter Hobart has wealth untold. He
should buiid a race track of his own; the
bones racing thereon should bear the
Hohart colors; the judges in the stand
abide by his word, and the jockeys hum
ble themselves at his greatness.
The cup is now the property of Mr.
Hobart. Mr. Sklniur, W. B. binfc Jr.
and Mr. Forsland, active competitors in
former races, refused to take part in the
pleasing exercises. Dr. Sheppard was a
prohibitive 1 to 5 favorite in the hooks,
and won with ridiculous ease. Mr. Hot
barfs own horse, Ferrier, ridden by Mr.
Dunphy, finished second. Una Colorado
and Hazard also ran.
So passes away a pleasant feature of
the California turf.
latlon (against the Bay City Wheelmen) would
have been In vain, and that had he thought
that such a law would be considered he would
have come prepared to defeat it. What does
he mean by this? Am I to understand that
other clubs would be lashed into line to vote
against this amendment? I hope not. There
is an old political saying; In California that
if one desires to defeat a bill or law (no matter
' h<Â«w meritorious) all one need to state is "the
Southern Pacific Company is In its favor."
Would this delegate therefore adopt the same
methods In his lashing of other clubs and rest
his arguments by saying the Hay City Wheel
men are behind this amendment? What if they
are? And why should not the Bay City
Wheelmen be in favor of such a law and do
their utmost to have it adopted? This club
has on its roll of membership no less than
forty out-of-town riders, and their Interests
practically demand that they defend any dis
criminating legislation against them. As "to the
statement that all past legislation would be
defeated by this amendment. I can only say
that it would he well if that were don?.
Have the California Associated Cycling Clubs
prospered during the past administration, with
Its methods and legislation? I think not. Have
the smaller clubs availed themselves of the
clause limiting riders permitted in club events?
I say no. Neither the last relay race nor the
race "for the Baker & Hamilton trophy had
any entries encouraged by this clause. In fact,
! the last mentioned race saw no competition
| by the Reliance Club Wheelmen of Oakland.
; Enclnal Cyclers of Alameda, Capital City
Wheelmen of Sacramento nor the California
Cycling Club of San Francisco. This last
mentioned club was encouraged by the Olympic
Club Wheelmen of Ban Francisco not to enter
a team, their pacing being too useful to the
Olympics.
I ask, could not these clubs by the adoption
of the "Joker" amendment draw from each
other and enter at least two more teams? Say
that the Acme Club Wheelmen of Oakland
drew from the Encinal Wheelmen of Alameda:
the Capital City, Wheelmen from the Stockton
Club, and the Imperial and the California Cy
cling Club of San Francisco combined, would
not Interest In such entries be increased?
Would not cycling in Sacramento, Stockton,
Oakland and Alameda be rjenefited? Any
equitable person must admit that the "Joker"
amendment has Its merits, and I think it
j should be permitted to remain a law. The
i law as it stood llmltine entries in club events
I to resident riders was passed and aimed
against the Bay City Wheelmen, and after it
i passed the association under the last admin
: istration did not act In good faith toward that
club. How was It that the entry of the Acme
Club wheelmen of Oakland for the last Baker
& Hamilton race, with Mr. Lind of the Im
perial Club of San Francisco as one of its con
testants, was accepted? Was the rule en
forced? Were the Acme Club Wheelmen noti
fied of their infraction of the Association's
pet measure? I do not mean by this to criti
cize the action of the Acme Club. The Bay
City Wheelmen hold and have always held
their associate clubs In highest esteem, and any
entry from any club In any race is always wel
come to compete against Its riders.
No event in which the Bay City Wheelmen
have competed has suffered owing to Its entry
of non-resident riders; on the contrary. it has
forced the interest of friends of cycling in
such towns as Santa Rosa, Los Angeles, Marys
vllle, etc. Does such Interest work hardships
to the association? In case of non-adoption of
this "Joker" amendment, will President Nip
pert be compelled to say to a non-resident
rider. "You must Join the association, but
you cannot compete in club events?"
Would It be well to embarrass him at the
very commencement of his administration?
Can he increase the now shrunken roll of mem
bership on the strength of such legislation?
I It may be stated that there are other bene
fits derived by Joining the association. Well!
Ahem! Let that rest. Racing and racing
clubs are the life of the association, say what
you will.
Speaking of racing clubs, there is one In this
State to which I bow with deference, and that
club Is the Garden city Wheelmen of San Jose.
i Long may they prosper; they are sportsmen,
' good find true. I am clad to extend to them
the hand of good-fellowship and to say, "Go
and win," for no defeat has ever marred your
conduct nor robbed you of a desire to better
your racing teams for the next event. I say
again, long may they prosper and may success
crown the efforts of the riders of the Fleur
de-Lis.
| As for the Bay City Wheelmen, its member-
I ship to-day is bound in a bond akin to Ma
sonry. No legislation, no laws of the asso
ciation, can crush the wearers of the Maltese
cross. Its members rise above racing Inter
! ests and in their place find rood-fellowship â
I that which clings through misfortune and ad
' versity, and that which makes man swear for
i ever his loyalty to man. It is this
i feeling which will forever exist among
us; it Is this feeling that compels
the admiration of all: it Is this
brotherhood that assures our existence. Legis
late as you may, there will always be the Bay
City Wheelmen. E. F. FAHRBACH,
President The Bay City Wheelmen.

HANNAH LOSES
HIS GOLD LACE
AND HIS STAR
Found Guilty of Being
Drunk.
CLAIMED HE WAS "DOPED"
SUMMARILY DISMISSED FROM
THE FORCE.
He Offers a Weak Explanation of
How It Happened That He Was
Found Helpless on Mar
ket Street
The Police Commissioners last night
dismissed Lieutenant Dan Hannah from
the department. Satisfied that he was
guilty of the charge of drunkenness pre
ferred against him by Captain Dunleavy,
the Commissioners unanimously decided
to deprive him of his star.
Hannah was defended by ex-Assistant
District Attorney Hosmer. It was shown
that on the night of January 3 Hannah
was found In a beastly state of intoxica
tion at Market and Spear streets. His
revolver and false teeth were lying on the
sidewalk where he had fallen.
Policeman Smith of the Harbor station,
not recognizing him, took him into cus
tody. Hannah was in such a helpless con
dition that he was unable to give his
name, and it was not until the arresting
officer found h.s star in his coat pocket
that he recognized him as the lieutenant
of the Southern station. He was at once
taken into the gymnasium and allowed to
sleep off the effects of nis debauch.
Several police officers testified that they
saw Hannah taken into the Harbor sta
tion and were satisfied that he was suf
fering from an overindulgence in liquor.
For some reason the Commissioners did
not call Officer Smith, who found Han
nah lying on tne sidewalk helplessly
drunk.
Dr. Bunker for the defense testified that |
he had treated Hannah several times for :
stomach trouble. Recently he was suf
fering from a cold and he gave him a
mixture which contained a small quantity
of cordial. He advised him to take a
drink of hot whisky after taking the
medicine.
F. A. Dunbar, a real estate dealer, tes
tified that he met Hannah about 9 o'clock
on the night he was found drunk. He
was walking along Montgomery street,
and according to the witness he was not
under the influence of liquor.
Hannah in his own behalf swore that he
had taken several doses of the cough
medicine before reporting off duty, and as
he was feeling bad he thought that a
drink of whisky would improve his con
dition. Aftrr taking one or two drinks
âhe could not remember the exact num
berâhe walked along Montgomery street
until he met his friend Dunbar. He had
a few minutes' conversation with him and
proceeded along Montgomery street to
Pine. After reaching Pine street he re
membered nothing until he was awaken
ed in the gymnasium of the Harbor po
lice station the, following morning.
The Commissioners evidently did not be
lieve his story, as they promptly agreed
on the verdict of dismissal from the de
partment.
Officer William D. Scott was also dis
missed from the department for ineffi
ciency.
SLOAN-COLEMAN SHOOT.
The Champion Jockey Defeated the
Bookmaker by One Bird.
The turf was well represented yester
day at the Olympic Gun Club's trap shoot
ing grounds. The feature of the day was
;t special match race between Johnny
Coleman and Tod Sloan, who were on the
cards to shoot a 100 live bird match: but
as a sufficient supply of pigeons wa? not
on hand to afford joy for the many han
dlers of the whip who were present and
who desired to enter the game, Coleman
and Sloan shot at only tlfteen birds each
for the purpose of giving their compan
ions a chance at stopping "quarterers"
and "tailers."
The contest between Sloan and Cole
man. as the score will attest, was very
exciting. The champion pig-skin sticker
missed his fifth bird, which was a left
quarterer flying close to the ground, but
he very prettily grassed all others in good
Style. Coleman missed his fourth and
lust bird, which lost him a champagn*
dinner.
A return match is certain to take place,
as Coleman wants satisfaction very bad
ly. The following is the score:
"Fifteen bird shoot, entrance $20; at
Olympic Gun Club grounds:

that the county Boards of Supervisors

The question was whether the Supervis

County Surveyor or if it should be givein â¢

it,ls the duty of the County Surveyor to

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â The stock market was
strong and active all day, except for realizing
movement around delivery houi, when prices
receded about a point In many stocks, but to
ward th- ciose picked up sharply and the clos
ing wis strong, with material net gains in all
the leading shares. The volume of business
â was above the million share mark, and Lon
don, after being a Feller for a long time, to
day reversed her position and purchased 35,
--000 shares. Following the example of the Im
perial Bank of Germany, the Bank of England
reduced its rate of discount. A continuance
of easy money conditions here was another
â¢ factor in the confidence shown to-day. The
Grangers made new high record prices for the
current movement, and the average price of j
active shares was about the hlehest. The
strong London tone encouraged a high opening 1
here, and as there was a large accumulation I
of buying orders over the night, the short in- ]
terests were compelled to retreat in many
stocks. There was heavy realizing at the ad- |
vance, but the stocks sold were well taken |
and the market broadened out. The greatest !
activity and strength was shown by Manhattan, j
Burlington. St. Paul, Sugar. Atchison pre- '
ferred. Reading first preferred and Northern
and Union Pacifies. The advance In sugar was
* credited to a rounding up of the shorts. The
, 'advance in Burlington seemed to be accepted
as meaning that something was under consid
eration in regard to a refunding scheme, al
though negotiations under way were said to
apply to the issue of only a small amount of
bonds. The interests concerned were noncom
; mital and there was no definite development
I o/<e way or the other. There was an advance I
In most of the Gould properties, some of which i
have been Inactive of late, Manhattan rising
4 1 , and Missouri Pacific 2 points. Among the
Investment stocks New York Central rose IV..
j The bond market showed relatively more ac
tivity than the stock speculation. Marked ad
vances were scored all around, with the un
dertone aggressively strong.
United States fives registered advanced U In
the bid price.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were more active and strong
to-day on the reduction by the bank of its dis
count rate to 3 1 ,Â» per cent, though a rate of
3 per cent was generally expected. In some
quarters it is thought that the bank fears gold
withdrawals, as Â£163,000 was taken for the
United States to-day, against Â£170,000 bought.
Americans were strong at every point and
there was a strong support. New lork came
strong and the close was buoyant at the top. |
The favorites were Northern Pacific and Cen- !
tral Pacific. The Rothschilds are said to be |
buying the latter. There is a flat denial of the
report that the Central Pacific scheme is ready, j
and it is now stated that It is even unsettled j
how far the Government will give way on the |
debt question.
Coppers boomed. Tintos touched 35, closing
at 34N- Anacondas were 7.
Money was slightly harder on the small re
duction of the bank's rate.
Silver was good on continued demand from
the East.

Canadian Pacific, 87Ti; Grand Trunk, 7H; bar

CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 19.â Unfavorable news from
abroad gave wheat a weak start. The Liver
pool market paid no attention to the advance
here yesterday, j but on the contrary was %d
lower, and the continental markets also tended/
downward, while all advices continued. \m
speak very encouragingly of the outlook fqry&
large yield In Argentina and India. May
opened %<S%c lower at 70%'S v 7o*;c, and although \
the crowd wore Inclined to buy their enthusi- (
asm was checked by the execution of heavy
selling ' orders for futures from the United
Kingdom in the hands of commission men. The j
Northwestern receipts were quite moderate,
however, and that. In the minds of local oper
ators, partially offset the bearish news from
abroad. Wall street stocks and cotton were
; both strong to begin with, and that was con-
I sidered another and still more Important reason
for disregarding the depressing aspect of the
European news, the consequence being that the
weakness at the opening was In a short time
replaced by a spasm of sentimental strength
and May wheat rose quickly to 71% c. New
York reported forty boatloads, which It worked
for export at an early period of the session,
and one of the many email successes of the
bulls In the day's market followed that an
nouncement. Sentiment In favor of higher
prices, however, exhausted Itself an hour or so
I from the close, when It was found that there
i was no demand for spot wheat at 3%c below
the speculative price of May. Near the end
early purchasers became sellers and May be
gan to sag slowly, finally working down â  to
70%@70%c, at which it closed, a loss of %@%c.
Corn met with buying of a character that
led the crowd to believe that prominent par-
I ties were becoming â  Interested. May closed a
I shade higher. .
I Oats followed corn closely, being Influenced
by the same reasons which governed the
leader. May closed at 27% c.
Higher prices for hogs, lack of offerings and
the steadiness of corn held provisions firm at
a small advance. Pork, lard and ribs are prac
tically unchanged.

DRIED FRUITS IN NEW . YORK.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â Journal of Com
merce says: There has been' considerable im
provement in the demand for dried fruits since
the beginning of the year, . although nothing
approaching speculative Interest has been
shown. Sales In most Instances . have been of
small quantities, but the movement has been
steady and stocks have been gradually ab
sorbed, both here and on the coast. This is
particularly true of apricots and peaches, the
supply of these goods remaining in first hands
being reported to be exceptionally light, while
Inquiries from distributors would seem to in
dicate that they are carrying small stocks.
! Smaller offerings of dried apples and a firmer
j market for the latter are said to be one of the
j chief causes for improvement of the demand
I and the better tone In peaches and apricots,
! since buyers, who for some time past have
given their attention chiefly to the first named
' on account of its comparatively low cost, are
more disposed to make purchases of California
fruits now that prices are more nearly equal.
The California raisin situation, so far as
the spot market is concerned, seems to be un
certain. According to a number of sellers
spot stocks are comparatively small, while
others assert that the supply is fully adequate
to all requirements for several months to come.
According to advices from interior markets
holdings of graded fruit are small, but In the
chief centers, like New York Chicago and
Philadelphia, the stock carried by first hands
is an unknown quantity and no one seems to
be in a position to make an estimate as to
its extent. The most unsettling feature is the
uncertainty as to the quantity of Pacific re
maining: unsold in the Eastern markets. In
prunes the spot situation is generally con
sidered to bo a satisfactory one from the
standpoint of large handlers, for while the
requirements of consumption at present are
comparatively light stocks of all desirable
sizes are said to be small, and as buyers have
been ordering from hand to mouth for some
time past it is expected they will soon be
forced into the market by the increasing de
mands for consumption and compelled to pay
I full prices.
LONDON WOOL SALES.

DOWN AND WEEPS
FOR SOME TIME
The Alleged Slayer of Raoctyer
Wilsor) Uooerved by a Visit
From His Wife.
BUISDN, Jari. 19.â For the first time
aince his arrest, charged with the mur
der of old Dan Wilson, W. J. Miller
broke down this morning and wept like
a child. The collapse of the alleged as
sassin occurred as he was being taken
back to his cell after an Interview with
his wife. Mrs. Miller came up from
Port Costa on the morning train and
went immediately t<> ihÂ» Courthouse in
Fairfield. The interview between hus
band and wife took place in the Sher
iff's office in the presence of Under
Sheriff Robinson and Deputy Sheriff
Reeves. They wecre not allowed to dis
cuss the Wilson oase, the conversation
being confined to strictly family af
fairs. When Miller was being taken
back to his cell at the conclusion of the
interview Mrs. Miller walked by his
side. As he bade her good-by at the
entrance to the jail he sought to re-
Hssure her, telling her not to worry as
everything would be all right and he
would soon be free. The poor woman
could not reply, and the moment Mll
)or was in his cell he threw himself on
his cot and burse Lnto tears. He was
left alone in his grief and continued to
Fob and weep for nearly half an hour,
but when the jailer looked in upon him
about an hour afterward he had recov
ered his composure and in a measure
the confident air which he has main
tained since his arrest, but he was
more subdued and less inclined to talk
than heretofore.
Mrs. Dickinson caught a glimpse of
her son and Mrs. Miller through the
barred window- of her cell as they were
returning from the Courthouse, and
â¢the sight completely unnerved her. As
Miller disappeared within the building
t=ho gave way to a fit of weeping and
lamentations. She blamed herself for
the present misfortune of her son, and
tearfully implored Mrs. Miller to for
give her. "It was a sorry 'lay for me
when I brought you and Bill (Miller)
up from Los Angt?les," she wailed, "and
1 would thank God if I had never
done it."
Mrs. Miller's visit to the Sheriffs
office was mainly for the purpose of
obtaining a new nrd.^r from her hus
band for his wagos duo from the rail
company. Miller gave her an or
der for the money when she was here
xeek. but it was written in pen
cil, and the railroad officials refused to
h<.nor it, insisting that it be made out
and signed in ink and duly witnessed.
Mrs. Miller is naturally much incensed
at those who have been instrumental
in placing her husband behind the bars
SAM'S BOW GETS
THE FIRST PLACE
Senator P Second, Cuba
of Kenwood Third.
WINNERS OF ALL-AGE STAKES
CHAMPION EVENT WILL END
FIELD TRIALS TO-DAY.
At the Annual Meeting of the Pacific
Coast Club It Is Decided to
Hold the Next Meet ia
January, 1900.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 19.â The six
teenth annual meeting of the Pacific
Coast Field Trials Club was held at
the Southern Hotel last night. The
following officers were elected for the
coming year: President, W. E.Stevens;
first vice president, C. N. Post, Sacra
mento; second vice president, H. W.
Keller, Los Angeles; secretary and
treasurer, J. E. de Ruyter, San Fran
cisco. Executive committee â J. E.
Terry, J. M. Kilgariff, W. Brooks Jones,
Frank Maskey.
The date of the next trials was set
for January 22, 1900. The same stakes
and conditions will govern. At the
close of the meeting the following dogs
Mere entered for the champion stakes:
J. E. Lucas' Alex C, Stockdale Kennels'
Sam's Bow, Cuba of Kenwood.
The second series of the all-age
stakes was run to-day. Cuba of Ken
wood with Alex C ran first. The other
brace was Sam's Bow with Senator P.
A large number of birds were found
near Mr. Trevis' house at Stockdale
and were driven out into the field
nearby, where the cover consisted of
short alfalfa. The dogs were worked
there and made a beautiful picture for
the spectators. The dogs could be
plainly seen ranging over the ground,
striking points and backs. In the work
of the first brace, Alex C and Cuba,
both dogs first, ranged well. Cuba
v. as first to find the birds in a cab
bagfl patch near the house. After a
few points here the dogs were moved
Into the alfalfa fields, where several
hunts wore made, Cuba showing a bet
ter nope and doing the work in a more
finished, positive manner. The time
â¢down was 32 minutes.
In the meantime another covey of
birds waa driven into near the race
track by Mr. Tevis' employes. The
second brace of dogs worked there on
low cover, the birds lying well. Senator
was first to find the birds among the
lung grass in the lane, but, unfortunate
ly made a few bad flushes before he
settled down to his work. After a few
points by each dog they were cast into
th<- field, where the spectators had an
other exhibition of fine work in open
ground. After going Into the field Sen
ator became more steady, making more
points than Sam's Bow. He showed
fully as much speed, ranging as wide,
but Sam outclassed him in the manner
of his work, showing more steadiness,
which is the result of greater age.
At the close of this heat the judges
rendered their decision, awarding first
to Sam's Bow, second to Senator P,
third to Cuba of Kenwood. The de
rision seemed to be a surprise to many
ppertators, whose opinions had been
based only on the latter part of the last
heat, failing to take into consideration
with the hangman's noose dangling !
threateningly over his head, and de
nounced them all from the Sheriff down
in vigorous language.
"They are all a pack of liars," she
declared while waiting for the bus
which was to convey her to the depot
this afternoon. "They have no â¢M
--dence against my husband, and lucy
cannot show that he had anything to
do with the killing of Dan Wilson."
She is especially indignant at the
methods employed by the amateur de
tective, Stranahan, to secure evidence
against Miller and his alleged accom
plices. She declared that he had lied
willfully and maliciously in order to
make a case against her relatives and
secure the reward offered for the ap
prehension and conviction of the mur
derers of the old rancher. She was
very anxious to know if Stranahan
would testify at the preliminary ex
amination, and when informed that he
would probably be present she seemed
much put out. Mrs. Miller returned to
Port Costa on the 3:20 train.
Mrs. Wilson was taken from her cell
in the insane ward of the jail to the
office of Attorney George Lamont this
morning for the purpose of holding a
consultation with the lawyer who has
been engaged by her mother to look
after their interests. She was escorted
across the road by Deputy Sheriff
Reeves and seemed to feel greatly re
vived by the warm sunshine. She is
very weak, however, and the effects of
her enforced confinement have told
severely on her, more so than in the
case of either of the other prisoners.
While returning to the jail she nearly
collapsed and but * the supporting
arm of the Deputy Sheriff would have
fallen to the ground. She says but
little and appears to be slowly giving
way to the terrible strain on her
nerves. Mrs. Dickinson was in a very
excited state all day, but no attention
was paid to her.
The authorities still have hope that
one of the trio will break down and
confess before the hearing is held next
Tuesday. There is a possibility that j
the preliminary examination may be
postponed on account of the serious ill
ness of Sheriff Savage. Under Sheriff
Robinson received a note by mail from j
the Sheriff this morning in which the
former stated that he was improving !
slowly and would try to be on hand for
the hearing. This afternoon a tele
phone message was received from Val
lejo, the Sheriff's home, to the effect
that Mr. Savage was very low. Under j
Sheriff Robinson became alarmed at
the seeming contradictions in regard to
the condition of his superior and went
to Vallejo to-night to investigate the I
matter. District Attorney Devlin did
not come to Fairfield to-day being de
tained in Vallejo by private business.

LEAKING GAS PIPES
CAUSE AN EXPLOSION
PETER AGGESSON INJURED IN A
CABLE TRENCH.
Leaky gas pipes passing under the
wheel pit of the Union Street Cable Car
Company at the junction of Montgomery
avenue and Washington street nearly
cost Peter Aggesson, an oiler, his life
yesterday morning. Aggesson had de
scended into the trench at the point men
tioned at half-past 11 for the purpose of
oiling the gear of the revolving wheel
over which the cable passes. He detected
no odor of pas. and after a time lighted
a small jet used to light the dark pit. For
a few seconds nothing happened, but gas
which had been escaping from leaky
mains soon ignited and a terrific explosion
occurred. Simultaneously with the re
port forks of flame shot out of the slot
for a distance of 300 yards in each direc
tion.
When the excitement subsided those
who had gathered on the scene found
Agge?snn lying underneath the machin
ery badly burned. His arms, face and
hands were severely scorched and he was
in an unconscious condition. An ambu
lance was summoned, and he was hurried
to the Receiving Hospital. There it was
found that in addition to his exterior in
juries he had breathed considerable flame
into his lungs. It is not believed his in
juries are dangerous.
The accident was caused by the explo
sion of gas which probably had been ac
cumulating for several hours. The shock
was sufficient to cause a general destruc
tion to windows in the vicinity.
BULLARD AND MARTIN
IN COMPLETE CONTROL
Captain Nevills' Partners Oust Him
From Possession of the Raw

Trustworthy information was received
from Scnora last night to the effect that
Captain Nevllls had been completely dis

Ballard and Martin started for San
Francisco yesterday morning after plac
ing Sydney Sproul in charge of the mines.
Sproul will undertake to prevent Captain
Nevills from regaining possession. Super
intendent Smith, at the App mine, re
fused to .surrender possession to Ballard
and Martin, who were obliged to take a
Deputy Sheriff with them to gain control
of that property. Nevilla Is expected to
arrive in Sonora any day and his advent
on the scene is expected to result in some
decidedly interesting developments.
DIRECTORS "STAND PAT."
No Change in the Proposition to
Abolish the Normal School.
Notwithstanding all rumors to the con
trary. School Director Holbrook states
that the Board of Education "stands pat"
on their intention to abolish the city Nor
mal School. The board made up their of
ficial mind that schools that could be
spared should be closed and the funds
heretofore used for their maintenance be
spent in schools that were more worthy
"The Board of Education," continued
Mr. Holbrook, "is too deep in the busi
ne w 8 , of Poetically disentangling the
school affairs of San Francisco to bo
swayed by sentimen. Just at pres
ent. Later on It may entertain sukkcs
tions along such lines. Some of the even-
Ing papers have been devoting considera
ble space In efforts to show that any sys
tem of retrenchment that discommoded a
comparatively few persons, even though
it benefited a large number, was both un
wise and unpractical.
"This, of course, would not affect the
determination of the boarcl in the pur
suit of economy. The subject of the
Mission High School has not been men
tioned in the board meetings."
Director Holbrook spoke in commenda
tion of Mrs. Fitzgerald of the Normal
School, and said that whatever might be
the disposition of that institution she
would be actively employed in the de
partment.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1899.
MUST BRING
HER PRICE OR
SUFFER DEATH
Trial of Ong Foon Is
Commenced.
AH LING AND HER TROUBLES
ALLEGED THBEATS TO COMMIT
FOUL MURDER.
The Defense "Will Show That Slave
Owners Conspired to Get the
Defendant Out of
the Way.
The trial of Ong Foon, a prominent
member of the Chinese Society of English
Education, charged with attempted extor
tion and blackmail, was commenced in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday afternoon.
Attorney Howry appeared as special pros
ecutor and Colonel Eddy represented the
defendant. A jury trial had been de
manded, but it was waived and the Jurors
were dismissed.
Ah Ling, the complaining witness, who '
lives at 10 Bakers alley, testified to the
fact of the defendant and two other Chi
nese calling upon her on December 25 and
telling her that they had expended $350 to
prevent her being arrested for giving a
false name at the Custom-house, and they
wanted the money, the defendant declar
ing that unless she returned the money
he would have her killed or sent back to
China. She told Wong Ah Dong, her
landlord, and he and Wong Tung came
into her room to ask an explanation from
the defendant.
In cross-examination the woman said
she came here about three years ago and
had lived at 10 Bakers alley for about five
months. It was a rooming house for
girls, and six or seven lived there. She
was engaged in doing needlework. Miss
Ling was asked as to whether the house
was not of ill fame, but Mowry objected.
Colonel Eddy said he wanted to show
the character of the woman, that she was
a slave girl and that the complaint had
been sworn to by her at the Instance of
her landlord to have the defendant ar
rested because he was giving information
to the Custom-house with the object of
stopping the illegal slave traffic.
Witness said that Wong Ah Dong ac
companied her when she swore to the
complaint. She had seen Leong Chee
Cum, who was one of the two men with
the defendant on January 3, and he de
manded the money again. She did not
think to have him arrested. She did not
want the defendant arrested, but Detec
tive Gibson and Lieutenant Esola came to
her and told her they had arrested Ong '
Foon for vagrancy, and they talked with
her about the other matter before she,
swore to the complaint. They came to the'
house as there was a flisturbance. Her
real name was Yung See Fung, but she
did not like It, and when she went to live
in Bakers alley she changed it to Ah
Ling.
Wung Ah Dong, the landlord of the
l^use, generally corroborated the
woman's statement, but contradicted her I
by saying that the defendant had only \
threatened to kill her. Nothing was said
about sending her back to China. In '
cross-examination he said he rented the i
rooms only to women. He was asked the
question as to whether he was not en
gaged in bringing women from China who
were not entitled to land here, but objec
tion was taken to it and sustained, lie
had no enmity against the defendant. He
did not know that a price of $2000 had
been placed upon the defendant's head,
but knew that he belonged to the educa
tional society. He admitted that he knew
defendant was instrumental in preventing
the landing of Chinese women here and
that he had assisted in deporting women
to China. He denied that he belonged to
a body of men banded together to get the
defendant out of the way. In re-exami
nation he said that defendant was ac
cuaed of blackmailing women.
Wong Tung also supported the woman's
testimony, but, like Wong Ah Dong, did
not hear the defenuant threaten to send i
her back to China. In cross-examination
he said he belonged in Santa Rosa, but
had been here for two months. He could
not tell what business he was employed in ;
and admitted that once he was engaged
in the landing of Chinese women.
This closed the case for the prosecution,
and the defense will go on this morning.
WEBSTER SUPERINTENDENT.
He Defeats Madison Babcock. After
Years of Litigation.
The contest of Reginald H. Webster
and Madison Babcock for the office of
Superintendent of Schools has been de
cided by the Supreme Court in favor of
Webster.- As a fact the recent election
decided the case, the cause of action
lapsing by the election of Webster. On
October 14, 1895, the office of Superin
tendent became vacant by reason of the
death of the incumbent, who on Novem
ber 6, 1594, had been elected to till the
office for four years, commencing on the
first Monday in January, 1895. On October
24 the Board of Education appointed
Madison Babcock to fill the vacancy
"until the regular election then next fol
lowing." On November 3, 1896, there was
a general election throughout the State
and in San Francisco, at which Webster
was elected to the office of School Super
intendent. Babcock refused to yield up
the office. He contended that he held the
office under the consolidation act and that
the words "regular election then next fol
lowing" meant the next election at
which officers of this class (Superintend
ent of Schools in counties) are to be elect
ed. In fact, the main point of contention
lay in the construction to be placeu upon
the meaning of the* words "regular elec
tion." The Supreme Court holds that the
phrase is synonymous with "general elec
tion" and says "> hether it be a general
State election or a general municipal elec
tion it is unnecessary here to determine,
since the election at which the relator was
elected was both a general State election
and a general municipal election."

FOLLY OF THREATENING.
A. Burgle Will Have to Serve Out a
Long Sentence.
"When Anthony Burgle went gunning for
Slgmund L. Braveman he got more than
he bargained for. Braveman filled him
full of lead, and now the Supreme Court
says that the judgment and order of the
Superior Court, under which he was sen
tenced to serve seven years in the State
prison, is not to be disturbed.
The two had considerable business
trouble, and one day some time ago
Braveman attached a grocery store be
longing to Burgle. Burgle was so angry
and so foolish as to state in the presence
of a number of people that he would get
his pl-stol and kill Braveman. The threat
reached the ears of the intended victim.
Burgle put in an appearance with his
weapon and Braveman opened up with
his own battery. When the engagement
was over Burgle was sent to the hospital
for the surgeons ta operate upon. They
were kept busy for several hours explor
ing half a dozen bullet holes in various
partÃ of the man's body. However, Bur
gle soon recovered, and in the trial he
was proved to be the aggressor and seven
years was the sentence. He appealed to
the Supreme Court, setting up the plea
of errors on the part of the Judge of the
lower court in his instructions to the Jury.
The higher court found no error and Bur
gle will have to go to prison.

Captains Bulger and Bolles, United
States local Inspectors of Steam Vessels,
finished yesterday their inquiry into the
loss of the freight steamer Protection,
which foundered about thirty miles off
the mouth of the Columbia River, Ore

GRANTED RIGHT OF WAY.
Valley Road Can Co~-truct Tracks on
Bryant Street.
E. F. Preston, attorney for the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Road,
appeared before the Street Committee of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday with
a request for permission to construct
tracks across Bryant street from the wa
ter front. The railroad officials want
access to the block of land bounded by
Harrison, Bryant, Main and Spear streets
upon which buildings and other require
ments of a terminal station will be erect
ed. Mr. Preston explained that it was
purposed to expend about $1,000,000 in im
provements in the vicinity. The members
of the committee agreed to report to the
board in favor of granting the request
embodied in the petition.
The Mutual Electric LJght Company,
which is making inroads on the monop
oly of the opposition company, was grant
ed permission by the Street Committee
to erect poles outside the fire limits. The
petitioners represented that they had
many applications for service of their
lights in the suburbs and could not afford
the expensive underground conduits cov
ering 80 wide an area.
The Street Committee before which the
application was made determined to re
port favorably at the next meeting of
the board on the matter. They will rec
ommend that permission be given for the
overhead system of wiring throughout the
City, but outside the fire limits.
The committee held an extended session
and acted on many street matters of
minor importance.
in Memoriam.
The passing away of Mrs. Harriet
Shober McKlroy in this city on January
13 takes from among us one of the old
est pioneer ladies of this State. Mrs.
McElroy was born in Lancaster, Penn
sylvania, in 1816, and at the time of her
death was In her 83d year. She ar
rived in San Francisco on the 22d of
November, 1549, and has resided In thl3
city ever since. She was a lady of re-
markable business ability and energy;
charitable and kind, and leaves behind
her a large circle of friends who ad
mired her for her sterling worth and
many good deeds. She had a wonder
ful memory and often entertained her
friends with graphic recitals of the
stirring events of the early history of
this city. Her life was an example
of quiet, earnest endeavor for all that
is good and true and it may be truly
said of her â
"None knew thee but to love thee.
None named thee but to praise."
Her ancestors were among the early
settlers of Lancaster, where many of
her relatives reside. She leaves in this
State a daughter, Mrs. A. P. Van

A GOAT'S SAD FATE
The Animal That Feasted on Tin Cans
Finally Falls a Victim to Deadly
Strychnine*
o
THE goat has always had the proud distinction of being the only do- O
mestlc animal capable of digesting anything from a tin can to a O
blacksmith's anvil, and never before in the history of San Francisco O
has the suspicion been entertained of a goat dying from poison admin- O
istered with murderous intent. Cats and dogs that make night hideous O
with their howling- have often fallen victims to wrathful householders by o
the aid of poison, and now the gentle nanny goat has to be added to the o
list. O
Mrs. Domingo, who lives on Fifteenth avenue. South San Francisco, o
purchased two goats to supply her baby with milk, as she believed its nu- O
tritive properties were superior to the cows' lacteal fluid. The goats o
browsed around the neighborhood, and, according to Mrs. Domingo, had o
only one enemy, a Mrs. Dodds, who took a dislike to them, owing to o
their love for her vegetables. The goats were all right Wednesday night o
when the family retired, but yesterday morning one was found in the o
o
yard cold and stiff, bearing evidence of having died a cruel death from O
poison. Mrs. Domingo and a lady friend called upon ex-Judge Eddie M. o
Sweeney and asked him to take action against Mrs. Dodds, believing o
that she administered poison to the goat. Judge Treadwell was seen and o
he was requested to Issue a warrant for Mrs. Dodds' arrest. O
The Judge questioned the ladles, but neither saw the goat die. Mrs. o
Domingo was satisfied, however, that strychnine was used, and the Judge o
advised her to get Dr. Creely or some other veterinary surgeon to make O
an autopsy on the goat's body, and if there was evidence of poison, then O
she could swear out the warrant. What worried Mrs. Domingo so much O
was the thought that she might have milked the goat Wednesday night O
after the poison had been administered and given it to her baby. O
Dr. Creely was engaged to make the autopsy, and he drove to Fifo
teenth avenue and got possession of the goat's body. He learned that o
poisoned cabbage leaves were found in Mrs. Dodds' garden, and the pre- o
sumption was that the goat had wandered into the garden and partaken o
of the poisoned vegetable. He instructed Mrs. Domingo not on any ac- o
count to use the milk of the other goat, for a time at least, as it might o
have also partaken of the poisoned cabbage leaves, but not to an extent o
to cause death. Dr. Creely was satisfied, from a cursory examination of O
the dead goat, that its death was caused by poison. O
HAY DEALERS
ANGRY AT THE
S. P. COMPANY
Cannot Obtain Decent
Accomodations.
FREIGHT YARDS A MIRE HOLE
BUSINESS CONDUCTED UNDER
GREAT DIFFICULTIES.
Eastern Railroads Provide Dry, Com
modious Sheds, but Uncle Collis
Affords Nothing but High
Rates and Mud.
The hay dealers of San Francisco are
thoroughly disgusted with the manner in
which they are treated by the Southern
Pacific Company. The hay men do an im
mense business with the corporation, and
notwithstanding this fact they can get no
accommodations whatever to facilitate
the handling of their bulky commodity.
In speaking of the matter yesterday one
of the dealers said In the interest of him
self and fellows:
"The cold-blooded manner of treatment
accorded us by the Southern Pacific Is
something to be marveled at. Their
freight yards around Townsend and Sixth
and Seventh streets are honored with the
nome of a hay market, but they are noth
ing more or less than a mire hole. Be
tween the tracks the mud Is from six-
Inches to a foot deep, and for this reason
and the fact that when It is raining hard
it is impossible to do business, we have
urged the railroad company to do some
thing to improve the facilities for doing
business with the hay men.
"What we want the company to do is to
scrape out that muck between the tracks
and fill it in with a proper substance so
that we can get in and out with our teams
in all kinds of weather. This they refuse
to do on the ground that the place is
leased land and that they do not expect
to be able to renew the lease after a
couple of years. Down at Tnird and
Berry streets there is a large, dry shed,
and we are enabled to do business with
expedition. However, the hay that comes
into the city by the schooners at that
point does not amount to much. The great
bulk comes over the Southern Pacific
lines, and that is why we feel that we are
entitled to decent accommodations.
"In all the large Eastern cities the rail
road companies provide commodious
sheds, wht-re the unloading of hay can be
done in all kind? of weather, and such
places become regular hay markets where
business can be conducted promptly. For
these reasons we think that we are being
ill treated and that it is the duty of the
company to accord us the facilities we
require. Whether or not we will succeed
in securing justice at the hands of the
corporation remains to be seen."
In this connection a matter that is seri
ously troubling the hay men is as to
where the company will be able to lay
down the hay when the tracks in the
yards mentioned are no longer available.
OLYMPIC ATHLETICS BOOMING.
Boxing, Indoor Baseball, Potato Rac
ing and Water Polo.
The Olympic Club Is displaying a good

ary 22, on the outside grounds of "the club
has been postponed.
On Wednesday evening, January 25,
there will be a potato race In the club
gymnasium, with twenty-five potatoes
placed one yard apart, the total distance
to be run amounting tÂ«3 aDout 600 yards.
First and second prizes will be given. The
time set for the event is 8:30. At 9 o'clock
on the same evening the first of the new
series of water polo games between the
Bull Frogs and Pollywogs will begin. The
Water Dogs, having dropped out of the
contest, the Bull Frogs and Pollywogs
will play the best two out of three games
for a new set of medals presented by
Leader John Hammersmith. John Elliott
will referee the game, and as he is the
original framer of the rules, he will take
care that the game Is played as it should
be and that no fouling is permitted. On
Wednesday evening the Bull Frogs and
Pollywogs played a practice game.
The two best handball teams at the
Olympic Club are Hampton and Bonnet
and James and Harrison. It is not cer
tain that the teams of the Reliance. Acme
and Encinal Recreation clubs will consent
to play against Hampton and Bonnet, in
that case Morton and Eagan will be the
second team representing the Olympic
Club. James and Harrison and also Mor
ton and Eagan will go over to Oakland
to-night for some practice in the courts
of the Reliance Club.
On Saturday, January 28, the entries
close for the preliminary six-round boxing
contest for the feather-weight (120
pounds) championship of the Pacific
coast, to be held in the club gymnasium
on Wednesday evening, February 1.
The cross country run will be from Sau
sallto to Lime Point and will take place
on Sunday, January 29. The 8 ' o'clock
boat in the morning- will be taken, and
the run will be followed by a swim and
dinner at Sausalito.
Early in February, probably on the sth
and 12th, a combination athletic event will
be held on the outside grounds, consisting
of a broad jump and one hundred yards,
quarter-mile and half-mile races. Three
prizes will be given, and the scoring will
be by points, first place in an event
counting three points, second place two
and third place one.
The mounted sword contest, twenty-nine
attacks, for the championship of the
world between Louis Tronchet, master-at
arms of the Olympic Club, and Ivan de
Malchin of the Russian army will take
place at Woodward's Pavilion on Friday
evening, January 27. There will also be
a wrestling match and foil contest by lo
cal men. Professor Louis Tronchet is
practicing at' the San Francisco Riding
School and believes that he has secured
a good horse, accustomed to sword prac
tice. His Russian antagonist relies on his
fine horsemanship and on his wide expe
rience in mounted sword contests, to
which Tronchet. though a good horseman,
is comparatively unaccustomed.
PASSING OF JAMES LINFORTH.
The Well-Known Merchant Suc
cumbs to a Brief Illness.
With the death of James Llnforth, who
died recently at his home at 422 Ellis
street, the community loses one of its
most upright If not one of its most prom
inent merchants. His untiring zeal in
charitable work of all kinds won for him
a large circle of devoted friends.
Mr. Llnforth was a native of Birming
ham, England. He came to this country
when he was a boy, arriving in California
in the fifties. Upon arriving in San
Francisco he obtained employment In a
hardware store. In 1867 he established a
similar business of his own under the
firm name of Linforth, Kellogg & Co.,
which for many years after was one of
the principal hardware establishments in
the city. At the time of the decedent's
death he was a member of the firm of
French & Linforth.
For many years past he has rendered
Invaluable assistance to the Chamber of
Commerce.
He was one of the original trustees of
the Californlar-Women's Hospital, and at
the time of his death was president of
the Foundling Asylum. He joined the
order of Odd Fellows in this city in 1859,
and for many years was regarded as one
of the ablest and most devoted represent
atives of the institution.
The remains of the deceased were taken
from his late home to Odd Fellows' Tem
ple, where the beautiful funeral ceremo
nies of the order were solemnized in the
presence of a large number of friends and
relatives. The pallbearers were: David
F. Walker. L. H. Bonestell, J. F. Cooper,
Captain Bruce, Thomas R. Bannerman,
James Patterson, Adam F. Green and W.
Edwards.
Marie Barna, a California girl,
tells how she was selected to sing
leading roles at the great Wagner
festival, in next Sunday's Call.

GOOD HAUL FOR
TWO DESPERATE
HOUSEBREAKERS
They Get Away With
Valuable Property.
BOLD CRIME OF BURGLARS
OPEBATE WITHIN A BLOCK OF
THE CITY HALL.
The Police Believe They Used a
Wagon in Carrying Off
Their nigotten
Booty.
An unusually daring burglary was
committed last night in the lodging
house at 327 Larkin street, within a
stone's throw of Police Headquarters.
F. R. Davidson, a well-known horse
man, was the principal loser. His
room was broken into during his ab
sence and almost every article of value
was taken. The burglars also secur
ed a check book, containing a check for
$200, which Davidson intended to cash
to-day.
Davidson left his room shortly after S.
o'clock last night, and on his .eturn
several hours later, he found the door
of his room open. Convinced that
burglars had entered his apartment
during his absence he at once sum
moned another lodger in the house and
together they proceeded to make an in
vestigation. Davidson found that the
crooks had gotten away with three
suits of clothes, several pairs of shoes,
a valuable book case, a satchel con
taining clothing, a dressing case and a
number of collars and hankerchiefs.
An examination revealed that the
burglars had used a skeleton key in
gaining an entrance. The apartment
was almost completely cleared of every
portable article and it is believed by
the police that the desperate house
breakers used a wagon in getting away
with their booty.
Shortly after 10 o'clock a well
dressed man was seen to enter the
house. He was accompanied to the
door by another individual, who re
mained outside. The stranger who
entered the house pretended to be in
search of a friend whom, he claimed,
had recently arrived from Montana
and had rented a room in the house.
On being told that the person for
whom he inquired was not staying in
the house the stranger left and imme
diately joined his companion. The
supposition is that they returned to the
house a few minutes afterward and
entered the room of the horseman.
Davidson is convinced that the men
are hangers on about the racetrack,
and that they in some way learned
where he is rooming.
Immediately after the daring burg
lary was reported to the police two
officers were sent to the house to make
an investigation. Beyond getting a list
of the stolen property they failed to
find anything which would enable them
,to obtain a trace of the desperate*
crooks.

ALAMEDA CITY
FLEECED BY A
CORPORATION
Telephone Company's
Illegal Bills.
ITS FRANCHISE VIOLATED
v
OVER $6000 PAID FOR TELE- â¢
PHONES THAT WERE TO
BE FREE.
An Effort to Be Made to Recover the
Amount, or at Least Part of
It, From the Corpo
ration.
AXiAMEDA, Jan. 19.â For ten years the
city of Alameda has been paying tribute
to the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph i
Company, contrary to the provisions of!
the ordinance under which the munici- |
pality granted the corporation a franchise
to operate its telephone system in this
city.
The corporation has received illegally
from the city treasury over $0000 in that
time for charges which, under the terms j
of Its contract, it had no right to make.]
Ordinance No. GB, passed March 12, 1888,
grants the Sunset Telegraph and Tele
phono Company and it* assigns a fran
chise to operate its lines within the city
â¢ limits. The consideration is set forth in
section 5 of the ordinance, which reads
as follows:
In consideration of the rights herein granted
the paid city of Alameda by its properly author
ized officers shall have the right to transmit
over the wires of said Sunset Telegraph and
Telephone Company, free of charge, all mes
sages relating to the city's business.
It was also agreed that this provision j
should Include the placing of telephones
In the city offices without cost to the mu
nicipality.
The telephone company never made any i
pretensions of carrying out its part of the i
contract. From the very start the city
â was charged for the use of the telephones
and lines, and the practice has been kept
up for close on to eleven years. The pe
culiar feature of the transaction is that
each succeeding Board of City Trustees i
has passed upon and allowed the bills
â without a question. Â»
When the officials moved into the new j
City Hall the clerk ordered telephones
placed in his office, the office of the Board ,
of Health and at the electric light works.
After they were in position the telephone
company was informed that no pay would
be allowed for them under the provi
sions of the franchise, and no bills have I
ever been present)
In the school and police departments,
however, the old telephones were trans
ferred into the new building. The com
pany had illegally charged for them ever i
since they had been in operation, and as '
no one seemed to object and no one de
manded that they should be used free of j
charge, the bills continued to be filed with j
the City Trustees, and have been present
ed and paid up to date.
The School Department had been pay
ing $22 50 a month up to 1895, when the !
Directors kicked a little and the tele
phone company magnanimously reduced I
the figure to $17 50. The police telephones
are costing the city about $30 a month,
and that has been the price for nearly ]
eleven years.
The attention of the City Trustees will
be called to the provisions of the tele- I
phone franchise, and the City Attorney j
will be asked to take steps to recover tne
money unlawfully paid to the telephone
corporation.

AN ARTILLERY ARGUMENT.
Lipka Tries to Settle a Divorce Case
With a Revolver.
OAKLAND, Jan. 10â The matrimonial
differences of Mr. and Mrs. Elkan M.
Lipka almost developed a tragical phase
this afternoon at the office of Mrs. Lip
ka's attorney, D. Mitchell, on Broadway.
Some time ago Mrs. Lipka brought fruit
for a divorce from her husband, who is a
pawnbroker at 845 Broadway. The com- j
plaint charged infidelity. Recently the I
parties condoned matters and. accor3t i^
to Lipka's statement. It was agreed ihat
the present suit be dismissed and a new
complaint on less sensational grounls be j
filed, Mr. Lipka agreeing not to contest. |
Mrs. Lipjta called at her attorney's of
fice this afternoon. En rou:e she passed
her husband's shop and he followed aer.
Whipping out a big six-shooter as he
stepped into the office he shouted to
Mitchell that "if he pursued any unpro
fessional conduct" lie would "shoot him
on the spot." LipjfSi demanded that the
divorce suit be immediately dismissed,
and still brandishing his revolver stated
if his orders were not compiled with he
would shoot the head off the attorney. But
for the timely Interference of a number
of spectators a tragedy with plenty of
bloodshed might have resulted.
"My wife and I agreed that this suit
should be dismissed," said Lipka, "and
she has so instructed her attorney both
verbally and in writing, hut he evidently
doesn't propose to do this. When I saw
my wife go into his office to-day I could
stand it no longer ami decided to take a
hand in the affair myself. They have tried
every way to catch me in .some compro
mising- situation, but each time I fooled
them. Now my wife, can have a divorce,
but not on the charges named, and that
fellow has got to have the ca.se dismissed
i or I'll know why," and Mr. Ltpka walked
away and frowned, murmuring to him
: self, "If he don't dismiss It to-morrow he
will see what will happen."

NICKEL-IN-THE-SLOT CASES.
Judge Treadwell Hears Them atid
Will Give His Decision Tnis
Morning.
The Police Judges called a meeting for
yesterday afternoon to consider the cases
i of the men arrested for having nickel-in
; the-slot machines in their possession, so
as' to arrive at some definite course of ac
tion, but Judge Treadwell went on with
I his cases yesterday morning and tne
j other Judges were left to look after their
| own.
Judge Treadwell had twenty-four cases
on his calendar and three were selected
for trial, the others, with the exception
of two, agreeing to abide by the Judge's
decision. The cases tried were those of
H. Boston, Henry Anke and St. Thorn
Worden. One represented the machine
where money drops out: tlit second where
checks drop out, redeemable by cash at
the bar, and the third where checks are
redeemable only in trade. After hearing
the evidence the Judge agreed to give his
decision this morning. It was at first
proposed to make a test case and take it
to the Superior Court, and Prosecuting
Attorney Carpenter was agreeable, as ho
had in view the Fisher case last May,
but the defendants changed their minds.
SHAFTER ASSUMES COMMAND.
He Relieved Major General Merriam
of This Department.
Ma.ior General Shafter at noon yester
day formally assumed command of this
department, relieving General Merriam,
who will now return to Denver.
There was no ceremony attendant on |
the turning over of the department by j
General Merriam. General Merriam sim- ]
ply issued a formal order, complying with '
his instructions from the War Depart- ';
ment, relieving himself of command, and
General Shafter acting under similar or
dera issued an order assuming command.
The general transacted no business of !
importance yesterday. He issued one or :
two routine orders. After a few hours
spent at army headquarters he returned
to Fort Mason.
The general and his party left the Pal- I
ace yesterday morning and went to Fort :
Mason, where he has taken up his for- !
mer residence. Everything is in readiness I
for the public reception to-night, which
promises to be one of the. largest of its i
kind ever held in this city.

the Marriage of Mr.
and Mrs. William
Fahey.
MR. AND MRS. WILLIAM
FAHEY celebrated last even-
Ing the twenty-fifth anniver
sary of their wedding at their
home, the Cosmopolitan Hotel, on
Fifth street. Surrounded by their

Mr. and Mrs. Fahey received the
congratulations of 150 guests, who
had assembled to do them honor.
The hours of the reception were
from 8 to 12 o'clock, during which
the guests wandered through the
artistically decorated apartments
and tripped the light fantastic to
the Inspiring strains of an excellent
stringed orchestra.
At midnight a magnificent supper
was served. A feature at the ban
quet board was a bottle of wine that
had graced the feast a quarter of a
century previous.
In many ways was the happy
event of the years ago recalled.

CARSON, New, Jan. 19.â Things have
taken on a red glow since yesterday In

| and stated that the matter would be
taken to the courts, and that he .still
considered himself chairman of the
committee.
The Stewart men are all smiles and
consider it their greatest victory.
The Republicans are also wearing a
; broad smile as they consider it the big

party. The Silver men are pleased as
i they claim that the renegades and
traitors have been weeded out of the

cast in the balloting to-day," Mr. El

TWO HUNDRED POUNDS
OF POWDER SET OFF
SAXTA CRUZ, Jan. 19.â An explosion
occurred this morning at 1 o'clock at the
California Powder Works, the second
within a week, but luckily no one was in
jured.
It was the single-wheel mill, and as no
one was in the mill at the time the cause
will ever remain a mystery.
The noise of the explosion and shock
awakened the people of Santa Cruz.
Two hundred pounds of blasting powder
was the size of the charge that went off.
The foreman of the mill, Joe Maynard,
was on his way to the mill, and was
within forty feet of the building at the
time of the explosion.
The building is of granite walls on three
sides, while at one end it is open. The
only damage to the mill was the roof be
ing blown off. The machinery is all right,
as the wheels weigh seven thousand
pounds.
This mill has exploded more times than
any others at the works, and several
times with fatal results to the employes.
The mill will be repaired at once.
WHITE SAYS THE
TREATY IS BEATEN.;
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â A Washing
ton special to the World says: Sena
tor White of California says: "The
peace treaty is beaten so far as this
session is concerned unless an amend
ment is accepted."
Senator White intends to rise to a
question of privilege to-morrow. He
will present to the Senate his reasons
for refusing to obey the resolutions of
the Legislature of his State, instruct
ing him to vote for the treaty and also
to vote against any amendment of the
same. He will quote many famous
precedents for asserting his right and
duty to vote his own independent con
victions, and not to be a mere register
of the will of a Legislature which did
not elect him. His colleague. Senator
Perkins, will obey the command of the
Legislature, but he Is reported to be
ready nevertheless to vote for the Ba
con resolutions declaring against the
annexation of the Philippines.
Selling Crackers, Not Liquor.
MILL VALLEY, Jan. 19.â Tho war be
tween the Tamalpals Land and Water
Company and certain persons to whom it
sold land with a provision that no in
toxicating liquors should be sold on the
premises, which provision, it is alleged,
was violated by several purchasers, has
broken out again with vigor. Onco more
the courts will bo called upon to sustain
the company in its claim that under the
provisions of sale It is illegal for the
persons owning the land to dispose of
liquor thereon either by selling or giving
it away.
It is said that the excuse to be offered
in this latest phase of tho trouble Is that
a crnckor or two is sold and the liquor
given with Itâ a pretext used at various
times in other climes.
Cramer Against Creed.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 19.â Another In
stallment of the dubious political methods
in vogue In the southern part of Marin
County was furnished the public to-day
by a continuance In the Superior Court
of the suit of Eugene Cramer to dispos
sess John E. Creed from the office of Con
stable of Sausalito Township, to which
he was lately elected, or rather, declared
elected by the Election Board.
It has been shown that, while the elec
tion proclamation called for two Consta
bles for Sausalito Township and the bal
lots specified that electors should vote for
two, the Board of Election and the Board
of Judges "did politics" to the extent of
instructing voters to mark their ballots
for only one.
Will Prosecute Poachers.
SAUSALITO, Jan. 19.â The officials of
the Tamalpals Country Club have deter
mined to put an end to the poaching and
wholesale destruction of game and iish
carried on within their preserves for sev
eral months past. They took the initial
move last evening by arresting two Por
tuguese laborers named Bonetti and An
zlno for spearing salmon. A vigilant
watch has been kept for poachers for two
weeks, but their movements were so se
cret that none of them were detected un
til last night.
Killed Wife ana Himself.
SEATTLE, Jan. 19.â David Williams, ex-
Surveyor of Kitsap County, shot and
killed his wife and then committed sui
cide this afternoon at his borne near Sil
verdale. The only cause that can be as
signed Is insanity. In taking his own life
Williams shot himself three times with
a shotgun. Two hours elapsed between
the first and third shots.
Dying From Trichinae.
TOMALES, Jan. 19.â Anzini, the man
who is in such a miserable plight
through eating pork infected with
trichinae, still lingers. He cannot be
safely moved from the fatal Conti
ranch. It is now about the twenty
fifth day of his illness.
For a Coast Revenue Cutter.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The Senate
Committee on Commerce to-day au
thorized a favorable report on the bill
authorizing the construction of a reve
nue cutter for the Pacific Coast at a
cost of $225,000.
Sailors Have Influenza.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 19.â Her Ma
jesty's ship Imperieuse leaves here on
Monday for a cruise In southern waters.
Sixty of her crew are 111 with the in
fluenza.
Marie Barna, a California girl,
tells how she was selected to sing
leading roles at the great Wagner
festival, in next Sunday's Call.
WILL INSIST THAT
COOK FIRED FIRST
Plea of the Stable Em
ploye's Slayer.
GATHERING THE EVIDENCE
BOTH SIDES ABE PREPARING
FOR THE STRUGGLE.
Mrs. Cook Orders Two New Gowns
in Which to Appear at the
Coming Murder
Trial.
Srvedal Dispatch to The Call.
NAP A, Jan. 19.â Every energy is be
ing put forth by prosecution and de
fense in the cases of Jesse Walters and
ex-Sheriff McKenzie, charged with the
murder of Alfred Cook, in preparation
for the preliminary hearing, which will
be held next week.
It was expected that the arraignment
of the accused would take place and
the date for the preliminary examina
tion be set before Justice Bradford to
day, but these proceedings had to be
deferred owing to the absence of
Attorney Beerstecher of the defense.
He is in San Francisco gathering evi
dence for his client. District Attorney
Bell and Deputy Sheriff Daly went to
San Francisco Tuesdrv- in connection
with the case, and Bell returned yes
terday, but left his companion in the
metropolis. The arraignment is set for
to-morrow morning.
The case promises to develop one of
the keenest legal combats ever wit
nessed in the Superior Court of Napa
County. Nerved by the intense public
sentiment that was aroused by the sup
posed wanton killing, the District At
torney is using every aid within his
power to obtain evidence, and is him
self personally active in the matter.
No less a degree of determination and
energy is being exhibited by the de
fense.
One significant point brought out in
the Coroner's inquest by the testimony
of Fred Jacks was that the first two
shots were considerably louder than
some of those that followed, the Infer
ence being that they came from Wal
ters' 44-caliber, and not from Cook's
little 32-caliber revolver, and that Wal
ters was the aggressor.
It is now claimed by the defense that
this testimony and the inference there
from will be demolished. It is asserted
that Walters' cartridges were loaded
with smokeless powder and Cook's with
ordinary black powder, and that the
latter's pistol, therefore, made the loud
er report, particularly as It was fired in
the confined space of the box stall. The
prosecution proposes to make actual
tests before the trial.
The statement of Attorney Johnston,
published in The Call excited con
siderable comment, and is interpret
ed as meaning that Mrs. Walters will
stand with the prosecution, at least in
the proceedings against McKenzie. She
is said to have ordered two new gowns
for her public anpearance on the wit
ness stand.
DEADLOCK AT SAN
JOSE NOT BROKEN
But the Mayor Is Authorized to Break
Into the Treasurer's Safe and
Count the Cash.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 19.â Daily Council meet
ings are afternoon features, and the at
tendance at these matinees are Increas
ing. The attraction Is the deadlock be
tween Mayor Martin and the Council over
the selection of a City Treasurer. Only
three Councllmen attended a special meet
ing called this afternoon and nothing
could be done. Another meeting will be
called to-morrow. The Mayor still ex
pressea a determination to name no other
than Joseph F. Colombet. and the Coun
cil declared it will not confirm him.
The Finance Committee has empowered
the Mayor to open the safe and count the
money in it, as Is done every month. An
expert has been sent for to open the safe,
as the late Treasurer Ewlng left no mem
orandum of the combination. Mayor Mar
tin was also empowered to put an expert
to work on the books.
At tho next meeting of the Council a
resolution will bo introduced instructing
tho Mayor and Finance Committee to open
the safe and pay the $36,000 worth of city
bonds that fell due on January 9. With
these bonds paid the deadlock over the
Treasurer will become a siege that prom
ises to last for some time.
PHYSICIANS REFUSE TO
SIGN DEATH CERTIFICATE
So a Coroner's Inquest Will Ascertain
the Cause of Ernest Wil
helm's Demise.
REDDING, Jan. 19.â Ernest Wilhelm,
a young man 19 years old, born and reared
In this city, died In convulsions at 4
o'clock this morning. He had been sick
but a day and night. Dr. J. M. Read was
called to see the patient, and later. Just
before death ensued. Dr. O. J. Lawry was
summoned. Both physicians have been
interviewed and each declares that he
will not issue a death certificate. Dr.
Read stated that the patient showed
symptoms of having taken something into
his stomach that affected his brain. Burial
cannot be made without a certificate of
death, necessitating a Coroner's Inquest.
OBJECT TO POLICE METHODS.
Building Trades Council Thinks
Th^re Is Too Much Economy
on Certain Lines.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last night the methods o: t!>e Po
lice Department were brought up and se
verely criticized.
The police force Is composed of men of
almost every trade and vocation. Nat
urally there are a number of carpenters,
painters and paperhangers wearing the
star and brass buttons. For some years
it has been customary when there was
a little carpentering or painting to be
done around one of the stations to take
a few men off the routine and put them
to work. As this crowds out legitimate
artisans, whose bread and butter depends
on this very work, they deprecate the
practice, and last night the venerable
head of the department was criticized in
no uncertain terms for permitting it. An
effort will be made to stop it once and
for all.
It was also reported that the contrac
tor who is remodeling Morosco's theater
had refused to agree to employ only un
ion men at union wages, and Messrs.
Page and McCarthy were deputed tc
visit him and talk over the matter. It
is probable that it will be amicably ad
justed, as the proprietor of the house has
always been on record as a friend to or
ganized labor.
ADOLPH SUTRO'S WILL.
It Has Been Admitted to Probate by
Superior Judge Coffey.
As was expected the will of the late
Adolph Sutro was admitted to probate
yesterday. W. H. R. Adamson, Mrs. Dr.
Emma K. Merritt and William McCrindle
testified as to the authenticity of the will
and Judge Coffey made the order admit
ting the instrument to probate. Letters
testamentary were issued to Mrs. Merritt
and W. H. R. Adamson, their bonds be
ing fixed at $300,000 each.
In accordance with the stipulation filed
by Attorneys Wheeler, Bishop and Mc-
Enerney the contest of Edgar E. Sutro
was dismissed without prejudice. In the
event the Supreme Court sustains Judge
Troutfs decision declaring the trust
clause Invalid the contest will not be
again taken up, but in the event the
higher court sustains the trust clause
then the will In its entirety will, without
doubt, be contested. .
Succeeds Gas Inspector Tupper.
Auditor Asa R. Wells has appointed H.
L. Crocker to fill the vacancy caused by
the resignation of O. M. Tupper, who was
elected Gas Inspector by the Supervisors
at their meeting last Monday. Strong
pressure was brought to bear on Mr.
Wells to appoint a politician to the va
cant clerkship, but he would have no one
except a man able to perform the duties
required of him In a satisfactory manner.
The new appointee was formerly a clerk
for the railroad.

NOW PREVENTS
COMBINATION
Secrets of the Big Deal That Is
Pending Between the Water
Companies.
Large Pool of Contra Costa Stock Soon to
Expireâ ls Hayward at Work in the
City Campaign?
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 19.
Next month the existence of an Im
mense pool of Contra Costa water stock
â¢will expire and with its expiration It
is probable that the consolidation of
the two water companies may become
an actual fact.
In April occurs the annual election of
the Contra Costa Company and a most
determined effort will be made if con
solidation has not taken place by that
time to oust the Pierce element in the
directory, as that element is now all
that Btanda between the coming to
gether of the two companies.
For the first time The Call publishes
the interesting facts connected with
one of the greatest financial deals ever
promailK:itt-il in this State. It affects
every citizen of Oakland and other
towns supplied by either the Dingee or
Contra Costa water companies be
cause water consumers are threatened
with a raise of rates to twice what they
are at the present time.
All that keeps the two companies
from coming together is a paltry $55,
--000, while the capitalization of the pros
pective consolidation Is $9,000,000.
At the present time the two com
panles are deadlocked. Practically they
are very close together and a conces
sion by the Pierces would instantly
toring about a combination. All the de
tails are arranged, everything is ad-
Justed with the exception of the dif
ference between the price paid for the
Mount Eden Water Company and the
amount President Henry Pierce de
clares that the Contra Costa Company
has paid for it. Theoretically they are
as far apart as they wore three years
ago and the conditions are such that
â within a month water rates may be
raised to the highest notch permitted
by the existing extortionate schedule
or a rate-cutting war may begin, such
as existed two years ago.
For over a year the two companies
have been anxious to combine and the
only obstacle in the way was the in
flexible demand of Alvinza Hayward
that if a consolidation were effected it
should be on equal terms. Hayward
always argued that his plant was
newer than that of his rival, that it j
cost loss to operate it, that it was as
valuable, that his water supply was ot
a better quality, more reliable, not de
pending on catchments, needed no ex
pensive system of filtration, and that he
had more customers than the Contra
Costa Company. Nothing could swerve
Hayward from his fixed purpose, and
not until a few months ago could he
be persuaded to accept the terms upon
which the combination is to be ef
fected. The terms are that Hayward
and his associates are to have three
million dollars in stock and that the Con
tra Â«"osta Company after consolidation
Should guarantee the payment of the
new company's bonds, aggregating one
million dollars.
To fully understand this big financial
problem it is necessary to know that
th" Contra Costa Company has bonds
outstanding of two million dollars. Its
authorized issue of stock is six mil
lion shares, of which three million
have been issued and the remaining
three million are still in the treasury of
the company.
The Dingee Company is capitalized
for four million, of which one million
dollars is in bonds and three million
dollars in stock. Both bonds and stock
are held by Hayward, Dingee and their
associates and neither has ever been
put on the market, consequently has
no known value.
The proposed plan of consolidation
whU'h is all ready to go into Immediate
effect capitalizes the combined com
panies at nine million dollars. This
amount is made up of the Oakland
Company's bonds, the Contra Costa
bonds, the three million dollars' worth
of stock Issued by the Contra Costa
Company and the remaining three mil
lion now in its treasury, which would
be turned over to Hayward, Dingee and
their partners.
This arrangement appears at first
Fight aÂ« though the Contra Costa Com
pany would absorb the Hayward con
cern, but this is not the case in reality.
The 30,000 shares held by the Contra
Costa company are distributed among
perhaps 100 shareholders, between
â whom harmony has not existed for
many years. On the other hand, Hay
â¢ward would absolutely control his
30,000 shares, and when it came to a
vote on the directorate he would have
no difficulty whatever in getting the
dissatisfied element of shareholders
now holding Contra Costa paper. It
has been known for years that the
shareholders, of whom the Chabots are
the largest, are opposed to the regime
of the Pierces. The Pierces have al
ways maintained themselves in office,
and in addition to Henry Pierce (the
president), Orestes Pierce (general
manager), and Marshal Pierce (an
other official), there are several rela
tives and friends well placed in the
company. So long as good dividends
were being paid on the Btock no one
cared much who ran the concern, but
when Alvinza Hayward entered the
field and created a disastrous competi
tion dividends ceased and factional bit
terness within the company increased
to a great extent.
Prior to the negotiations taking defi
nite shape it was stipulated that each
company should meet free of debt â that
Is to say, that prior to consolidation
each should pay off its floating indebt
edness. The Dingee Company has no
floating indebtedness, and the Contra
Costa Company was understood to
have had but $10,000 outstanding, but
when balances were struck this amount
was found to be over $100,000.
This large debt had to be cleared off
by the company before a basis of agree
ment was reached. The Contra Costa
people were Very anxious that It
should be taken care of by the com
bination, but Hayward was obdurate,
and finally the debt was provided for
by its contractors.
About two years ago, when competi
tion was at its height, Contra Costa
stock fell from par to $30, and there
was great fear that Hayward would get
In and obtain a majority of the Btock
at the low figures. This was feared
by Messrs. Prescott, Tom Brown and
Whittier, and they at once formed a
large pool composed of a controlling
amount of the stock and agreed that
rnder no condition should any of such
stock be disposed of for two years. At
the annual electio-n last April the pool,
which is friendly to the Pierces, voted,
and of course retained control. Next
month this pool goes out of existence,
and as it Is understood that nearly, all
the directors except the Pierces are
anxious to come to a permanent agree
ment with Hayward and stop competi
tion there will be a virulent effort
made to put the Pierces out.
The bone of contention that Is now
keeplnp the companies apart is a paltry
pumping plant located near Mount
Eden. This pumping plant was offered
to Dingee when he first entered the
water business for a comparative trifle
â$2000 or 53000. Feeling confident that
the Alvarado supply was inexhaustible
Dingee declined the offer of the Mount
Eden plant. As a matter of fact the
artesian belt in that district is general
and there Is nothing to prevent any
body from sinking as many wells as he
likes and piping it into Oakland.
When it was soen that there was
likely to be another dry year the Con
tra Costa Company, which depends en
tirely on its reservoirs for its supply,
considered it advisable to supplement
its catchment system with a pumping
plant. It acquired the Mount Eden
plant, which was incorporated by Sam
Bell McKee and the Pierces, and the
corporation was later absorbed by the
Contra Costa Company far a sum. un
derstood to be about $60,000. With a
few improvements made after it was
offered to Hayward and Dingee the
plant is said to be worth not more than
$7000*
During the negotiations toward an
agreement the Pierces demanded that
the capitalization of the Mount Eden
plant be considered a debt of the Contra
Costa Company and be assumed by the
united companies. Hayward agreed to
this if its cost price be made the amount
of the debt, but the Pierces stood firm
and demanded the amount for which
they had capitalized it, and therefore
a difference of about $50,000 is all that
keeps the two big corporations apart at
this day.
Alvinza Hayward is known to favor,
in the event of consolidation, a large
reduction in the amount of stock. He
believes that a $9,000,000 capitalization
would be altogether too high for a
town the size of Oakland, in the event
of placing the stock on the market. He
has said that a water plant for Oakland
could be obtained on a capitalization
of $4,000,000, and that such stock would
at once find a good market. Experts
declare that $2,000,000 worth of city
bond? could duplicate either of thr.
water plants now existing, because sÂ«c%
I bonds would be wortn rar more than I
the same issue of bonds of a corpora
tion. It is more than suspected that
the platforms recently adopted by the
Municipal League and Republican
; party, favoring the municipal owner
i ship of waterworks, have not been ln
i serted for the single purpose of catch
| ing votes, but that it has emanated
; from those interested in the new enm
; panics. Some taxpayers have even
! gone so far as to say that Hayward
would accept $2,500,000 in city bonds for
his plant, and that then the City of
Oakland would be Independent of pri
vate corporations.
BOBBED OF HER BABIES.
Mrs. Marrea Shlifko Claims That Her
Husband Has Taken Them Away.
Mrs. Marrea Shlifko, residing at 51 Jer
sey street, complains that her husband,
Joseph Shlifko, abducted her children last
Tuesday and 1 refused to give her Infor
j mation as to their whereabouts. For fear
of his vengeance the woman refrains from
| asking the police to assist her in a search
| for her offspring, but friends will bring
the matter to the attention of the officers
if the little ones are not produced soon.
According to her story, the family Is
indigent, and her husband forces her to
toil for the daily bread. He frequently
beats her, and last week administered to
her such a severe thrashing as to pre
vent her from attending the cigar fac
tory where she works. It was rent day
Monday, and her delinquency in salary
prevented the landlord from receiving his
rent. He threatened ejection and the
father took the two children and left the
I house. He informed the woman that he
! was simply going to a neighbor's house
and would soon return with them, but
put in an appearance yesterday morning
unaccompanied by the children. When
questioned concerning them he said that
he had placed them in a poorhouse, â  but
would give no further Information. The
mother is frantic and threatens to take
her life If she cannot have the children
back again. Some of the neighbors fear
that she will carry out this threat.
Last night the father offered to com
promise the matter, Baying that he did
not care whether he lived with his wife
or not, and would be willing to return
her one child if she would give him the j
right to hold the other one after a sep
aration. This proposition was met with
refusal, whereupon he Informed her that
he I would persist in keeping them both.
The elder of the children. is a girl, aged
five years, and the younger a boy of four
years.
