After a consideration of the subject the Government authorities have decided that until the treaty of _eaee

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.âHav
ing failed to receive from the
State Department any answer
to his latest communication.
Senor Agoncillo, the envoy of
Aguinaldo, will in a few days take an
other step to bring the latter's cause
to the attention of the Government.
Just what form this will take and what
representations it will embody Agoa
cillo's attorney declines at this time to
reveal.
The envoy here is keeping in close
touch with the conditions existing in
the islands, and, it is said, is using his
influence with Aguinaldo to avoid hos
tilities with the Americans as long as
possible. Such advice as has been
vouchsafed was in the direction of
averting a rupture so long as this is
"consistent with Filipino independ
ence."
General Otis cabled the War Depart
ment to-day from Manila as follows:
"MANILA, Jan. 26.â The transport
Zealandia left to-day for San Fran
cisco with 164 officers and enlisted
men."
The soldiers on the Zealandia are
said at the War Department to be con
valescents. The dispatch, like the last
received from General Otis, was re
garded as satisfactory because he made
no mention of a change in the condi
tions at Manila, as he would be sure
to do had there been any insurgent
outbreak.
MANILA. Jan. 21, via Hongkong,
Jan. 26.â The Republica, the official or-
gan of the Filipinos, announces that
the Congress at Malolos has adopted
the Philippine constitution, passed a
vote of confidence in Aguinaldo and
empowered him to declare war on the
Americans whenever he may deem it
advisable.
At a mass meeting of women at Ca
vite yesterdaj-, the paper adds, it was
enthusiastically resolved to petition
Aguinaldo for permission to take the
men's places in defense of independence
and to bear arms, if necessary.
Paterno has asked for and, it ap
pears, has been granted the privilege
of taking a prominent place in the line
of battle against the Americans.
An American sentry yesterday even
ing killed a captain of Filipino artillery
at the Tonto outpost. As a result, the
native press is intensely excited and de
nounces it as a "cowardly assassina
tion." On Saturdaj - evening (January
21) five Filipinos, determined to have
revenge for their captain's death, at
tempted to enter our lines. An Ameri
can sentry killed one of them, who was
armed with a revolver, and after a fur
ther exchange of shots, the others were
arrested. The incident has intensified
the excitement here.
The Ambini Cabinet insisted upon the
liberation of the Spanish prisoners in
commemoration of the proclamation of
the Filipino republic and also donated
money to the native clergy. A decree to
that effect was signed. The Spanish
clergy, however, remain prisoners.
An elaborate programme has been
arranged for the formal ratification of
the constitution to-day.
â¢ Nothing was accomplished at the con
ference here yesterday, and it is ru
mored that the Filipinos, at their r_-xt
â¢ meeting, will give the Americans eight
days in which to accede to their de
. mands for recognition. The rumor is
â  .discredited. '.'.'â¢
â¢ MADRID, Jan. 26.â Cabinet met
this afternoon under the presidency of
the Queen Regent. The absence of Gen
eral Correa, the Minister of War, was
much commented upon and is believed
to have been connected with a decision,
.. not yet divulged, reached by the su
â¢â¢ preme military tribunal relative to Gen
eral Jaundenes, the Spanish comman
; der, who capitulated a: Manila and who
has been in prison since yesterday, and
.General Toral, who capitulated at San
tiago de Cuba and who is absent from
â¢ Madrid.
. The Premier, Senor Sagasta. outlined
.- the Government's Intentions relative to
The San Francisco Call.
the peace treaty. He said that informa
tion received by the Minister of For
eign Affairs, Duke Almodovar de Rio,
I had created the impression that Presi
dent McKinley feared the treaty would
be defeated in the .Senate, and appre-
I hended an obstinate resistance on the
part of the Philippine Insurgents
against the Americans, who desire to
-deprive them df-._depen__nc_ and de
base the Spanish government,; which
are sufficient reasons for. the triumph
of the anti-ahnexationists in the Sen
ate. Therefore, the Premier insisted
that the convocation of the Cortes
: should no longer be delayed.
The Cabinet met again this evening,
Senor Sagasta presiding. It appears
that the evidence before the court
martials showed that General Jaudenes
had sufficient ammunition to have en
abled him to resist longer. The court
ordered his arrest, whereupon he sur
rendered himself, attired in civilian
dress and accompanied by his son and
several ministers of state. General Cor
rea confirmed the arrest. It is reported
that the court-martial will exonerate
General Toral on the ground that he
acted under superior instructions, but
that Admiral Montejo, who was de
feated bj- Admiral Dewey at Cavite,
will be tried for the incompetent condi
tion of his fleet.
The newspapers assert also that Ad
miral Cervera is awaiting trial, and
that therefore he will not be able to
take his seat as a Senator on the re
assembling of the Cortes.
It is understood that at the Cabinet
meeting this evening Senor Capedepon,
Minister of Interior, proposed that the
suspension of the constitutional guar
antees should now cease.

for the Home Department, was the
j principal speaker this evening at the
great Unionist, demonstration at
â  Blackpool.
Referring to the historical events of I
; the past year, and particularly to the
Spanish-American war, the Home Sec
retarj- said that i while the absolute
neutrality of Great Britain j had not
been -property appreciated by one of the
contestants,- the English people had
been gratified at the good feeling which
has arisen between the United States
and Great Britain. The results of the
war had been to make the United
j States an important factor not only in
Asiatic but possibly also in European
politics and to bring America face' to
face with seme of the colossal problems
and difficulties which Great Britain had
long experienced.
"This," he continued, "is a serious
event for the great powers of the
world, but It is not likely to be disad
vantageous to the British empire,
which gladly acknowledges the kindly
sympathy and the sense of common ob
jects now animating alike the citizens
of Great Britain and the United States
and which feels that the continuance of
the growth of this feeling must tend
to the peace and prosperity of the
world. The growth of such a feeling Is
far better than the formal alliance
suggested by some."

MENTO, Jan. 26.â 1f , the recom
mendations of the Assembly In
vestigating Committee are ac-
I cepted Speaker Howard E. Wright
! will be shorn of power and dismissed
> from his seat in the Assembly. The
J ; coat of whitewash that Colonel Burns
; : promised him will not be applied, unless
j i it . is done *â  by a majority vote: of.
; J Wright's fellow-members.
I ! Not only will Speaker Wright lose his

! ; he is to be given company in his dis
; ; grace. Milton J. Green, U. S. Grant's
! ' political .manager, is on the report for
! ! as warm a scoring as honest men can
> give one whom they believe has re
j sorted to dishonest and.reprehensible,
i methods to influence and debauch
' ! members of the Legislature. Mr. Grant,
! who provided the money, which was'
j doled out by Green to prospective leg
' ! islators in return for . promises that
i they would vote for Grant for Senator,
is scored in the. report as a person who
; has aided and abetted ,"'a practice so
I reprehers* ble that it deserves theTniQSt
| severe censure at the hands of the Leg
islature and all people" who have an in
terest in the fair fame of the State.
Having dealt out stern and equal jus-
I tice to Wright, Green and Grant, the
i committee will, in its report, take up
! the case of D. M. Burns and William
IF. Herri n. The acts of this pair of
I politicians in issuing passes and rail
| road tickets to legislators will be com
; mented on so severely and so plainlj-as
to leave no doubt as to the conclusion
of the committee that the issuance of
this transportation was for the pur
pose of influencing the votes of legisla
j tors in the Senatorial contest
The committee report as it will be
presented to the Assembly to-morrow
afternoon or Saturday morning is com
plete with the exception of such part
as will relate to the investigation of
! the accusation that has been made
â  against Assemblyman Cosper, chair
! man of the committee. Evidence bear
, ing on this charge will be taken to
morrow morning and the conclusions of
1 the committee regarding it will then
| be added to the report as it now stands.
The report as prepared recites that
! Speaker Wright received the sum of
i $1650 from Milton J. Green, and that in
i the opinion of the committee the money
was paid and received under an agree-
ment. understanding or pledge that
Wright should vote for Grant for Sena-
; j tor. Each important detail of the cvi
, dence pointing to the conclusion that
: Wright received the money, and that
he received it by reason of a pledge
given to vote for Grant, will be set
I forth, that the Assembly may judge of
j the justness of the conclusions arrived
at by the committee. Having done
I this, the committee will suggest that
! the proper course to be pursued should
I be. expulsion of Wright from the As
sembly. It will be stated, however,
that inasmuch as Wright is the Speak
â  er of the Assemblj- and that he was
given the position by the Assembly, it
, should rest with that body, and not
| with the committee, to mete out such
punishment to him as may seem to fit
i the crime.
In the case of Green the committee
will set forth that he has used the
j money of his employer in a manner cal
culated to prevent the exercise by cer
; tain members of /the -Legislature of
i ' their own will and choice 1 In the matter
I of the election of a United States Sen
â¢ ator. - Also that money so used was
I given to present members of the Leg
islature at a time when they were
seeking election and that it was given
in return for promises given by the
i members themselves to men who were
jso situated as to be able to control
, them, that they would, in case of their
I election, vote for Grant for United
States Senator. The case of Wright
; will be cited as a proof of this, and that
:of Jilson of Siskiyou, who admitted
j having received $400 from Dan T. Cole,
who in turn admitted having received
j it from Green to promote Grant's can-'
I didacj-.
The report sets forth that while it is
i probable that in a majority if not all
i Instances where money was paid to
I legislators or to men who expected to
j become legislators Mr. Grant may have
| been ignorant of th^ details of the ac
| tual transactions as well as the
I pledges demanded and received, it is
! still true that he, provided the funds
I and should therefore be held equally
: guilty with Green. In one Instance
citedâthat of the paj-ment to Wright of,
â¢ $750â it'is known that Grant knew that" 1
i the money was for Wright, and, if no
I worse, that it was given Wright with
I the idea In mind that it would retain
i him in the Grant camp. The report
also sets forth that it is apparent that
I Grant knew that his money was being
j spent in a manner calculated to in
' fluence members of the Legislature
' prior to. the assembling, of that body
j relative to the manner in which they
J should vote for United States Senator.
The committee's report deals at some
length with the transaction whereby
William F. Herrin issued two railroad
tickets from San Francisco to New
i York to a friend of Assemblyman Mer
: rill at the request of Dan Burns. The
baldness of the excuse given by Burns
and Herrin on the witness stand is
! pointed out. as well as the limping ex
planation given of the transaction by
; these two justly celebrated politicians.
One detail in particular, that of pay
ment for the tickets, is made a subject
; for comment not particularly compli
, mentary to either Burns or Herrin. Still
: another count is added to the indict
ment of Herrin and the further ar
raignment of Wright. It is the transac
, tion whereby Wright .went to Herrin
! and secured a mileage ticket over the
Southern Pacific Company's lines. : The
report sets forth that Herrin testified
that Wright paid for the ticket, but the
, Assembly is left to judge as to the truth
i or falsity of the statement.
When the investigating committee
' met to-day a dispatch from Charles G.
Lamberson was read to account for his
failure to appear before the committee
in response to the subpena that was
served on him last Sunday. The tele
gram stated that Lamberson would be
in Sacramento by noon to-mprrow.
The committee agreed that if he did
not make his appearance at the time
specified he would be reported to the
Assembly as having disobej-ed the
summons of the committee.
After some discussion as to the proper
course to be pursued to secure the tes
timony of Milton J. Green in the mat
ter of the accusation that Assembly
man Cosper solicited through Lamber
son a $6000 bribe from Green It was
finally decided to appoint a committee
to take Green deposition, he being con
fined to his room at the Golden Eagle
Hotel by illness. Chairman Cosper ap
pointed Burnett, Melick and La Baree.
Green's phj'slcian refused to allow any
one to see him this afternoon or this
evening, but agreed to permit the com
mittee to take his deposition to-morrow
morning.

said, declined an offer of $3000 to vote
for R. N. Bulla as his second choice for
Senator, has not yet been found by the

BULLA MEN WORK
TO GET A BREAK
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
; MENTO, Jan. 26.â Bulla people are
jof the opinion that Grant's â¢ solid
i twenty-eight have made a mistake in
! agreeing to stand by their favorite to
| the end of the session, to consider no
! second choice, and thereby to insure the
; defeat of Daniel M. Burns.
Bulla's men figure that Colonel Burns
could get about ten more votes if Grant
were to withdraw. They also figure that
If Grant were to declare himself out of
the race there would still be enough
Republican members who would stay
out of a caucus to wipe out all possi
bility of 'Burns winning the toga by a
dictate of King Caucus. The Bulla men
figure that if Grant is out of the fight
and his men free to do. as they see fit.
ten of, them, but not any more at the
outside, might sign a call for a caucus.
This would bring the total up to only
thirty-seven, counting all of Burns'
twenty-seven votes, which are unques
tionably unitedly in favor of a caucus.
Then the Bulla folks figure that out
of the remaining thirty Republican
votes left there are only five that would
possibly find their way to _ caucus calL
There can be found no Senator nor
Assemblyman outside of the Burns
column who says that he favors a
caucus and will boldly come out in tho
open and declare himself to that effect.
It will be a sorry day for the eight Re
publican legislators for Los Angeles
County if at the dictates of King
Caucus they should ever be compelled
to vote for Burns for Senator. It would
mean political death to every one of
them who, on any account or for any
reason, public or private, financial or
promise of future political advance
ment, was to go over to Burns. The
members from Los Angeles County are
well aware of this feeling that exists
against Burns in Los Angeles County,
and in all Southern California this
statement applies with equal force.
Some of the Los Angeles members â one
Senator and one Assmeblyman â
like to land in the Burns camp, but
they dare not do so in the open. On the
quiet they are urging the caucus all
they can, but not openly.
Mr. Bulla has tried to persuade Gen
eral Barnes to retire and throw his
votes to him. General Barnes treated
the proposal with great lack of cor
dialitj- and suggested the possibility of
Bulla withdrawing and throwing his
thirteen votes to him, which would
then give the general a total of twenty
four votes and make him an important
factor in a race in which he might cut
a considerable figure. But neither
Barnes nor Bulla could agree as to who
was the proper man to pack his things
and retire from the Golden Eagle Ho
tel and the ; Senatorial race. Their in
terview came to naught.
James Brown, Grant's leading man,
when asked as to whether or not the
Grant men would, in the event of
Colonel Burns dropping out of the con
test, go into, a caucus, replied: "The
twenty-eight supporters of Mr. Grant
will go' into a caucus when they have
a written agreement signed by forty
three Republican members j unquali
fiedly pledging themselves to vote. for
Grant. Then we Will go into a caucus,
but not till then." This is the pro
nunciamento of the Grant forces. .
"Walter F. Parker departed for the
south to-daj- to do some , hustling in
Southern California for Burns. He will
endeavor to secure the indorsement of
Burns by some of the county Repub
lican committees In that part of the
State.
E. A. Meserve, who Is leading Bulla's
fight, went down to watch Mr. Parker.
Both will be back Monday.
Ex-Attorney General W. F. Fitzger
ald arrived to-day from San Francisco.
He says that he has no desire to inter
fere, nor will he mix up in the Sena
torial fight.
Major M. T. Owens arrived from Los
Angeles and is listed at the Bulla head

Mr. de Young recently had a siege of

INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
BURNS DRIVEN
TO DESPERATION
The Mexican Now Playing Every Known
Political Trick.
Seeing Ruin Staring Him in the Face, He Tries
to Stack the Cards to Deceive and Hold
His Weary Supporters.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 26.â The touts are saying
to-night that there has been a great
change of sentiment regarding Burns,
and that the people vi the State want
him for Senator because the news
papers are against him. There are no
indications at this hour that the Re
publican members of the Legislature
want Burns for United States Senator.
No gains were registered for Burns in
the joint assembly to-day. His voting
strength is where it was the day that
Howard Wright deserted Bulla. Every
influence that Burns and his touts,
backed by the Southern Pacific Rail
road, could bring to bear has been em-,
ployed to boost the colonel to first place
in the contest, but he is still below
Grant. \
The colonel is now playing another
' card from his sleeve. Agents through
out the State are seeking to get County
Committee resolutions passed com
mending Burns for the Senate and ad
vising the Legislature to break the
deadlock. The game was opened in
Marin County, but it did not work in
that locality. A majority of the County
Committee could not be corraled. The
expected indorsement was denied and
some other county committees will be
warned. The last and only hope of the
Burns following is the secret caucus.
It is not certain by any means that
Burns can win with a caucus, but it is
â¢ a sure thing that he cannot win with
â¢ out one.
' . All the touts talk of something to
' . happen early next week. This time they
expect Dan to do something and the
"Colonel" himself knows that some
thing must be done to hold his own
â ' forces. He perceives that he cannot
block the legislation of the session by
deadlocking the Senatorship. The As
sembly has already passed eleven bills
and the third reading file to-morrow
will present thirty-six measures. The
. San Francisco charter is out of the
way and the coyote bill will soon be up
for general discussion. Less than a half
hour's time each day is consumed in
voting for United States Senator. It is
the sentiment among leading Republi
cans here that the people can get along
without a Senator rather than submit
to' the disgrace of Burns' election.
. ' There will be a general assault on the
Grant camp between this time and
â¢next Monday evening. Colonel Burns
.'â¢ is making a close study of the weak
.' places in the Grant line. The Bulla
men also believe that the disintegration
.of the Grant forces must come at an
' early day and they are cherishing the
' belief that the break will not benefit
.Burns. The proposition is laid down,
that Burns could not get a caucus if
the Grant men were left perfectly free
to go to whomsoever they pleased. In
. â¢ the break Barnes, Bulla and Scott
would get the majority of Grant's men.
The Bulla and Burns men are therefore
fighting on the same line in opposition
; to Grant.
Wherever the slightest weakness is
disclosed in a supporter of Grant the
touts make a dead set to surround him.
It is believed that Le Barron of Sonoma
is preparing to leave the Grant fold.
He is convinced that his constituents
want him to leave and do not want him
to go to Burns. He says that the peo
ple of Petaluma are in favor of General
Barnes for United States Senator and
he also announces an intention to be
guided by the desires of the people
who elected , him. He acknowledges
that Petaluma is solid for Barnes, but
fancies that other sections of the county
may favor Scott. While entertaining
these conflicting notions concerning the
popularity of Barnes and Scott he is
reflecting that Colonel Burns would not
be personally objectionable to himself.
Le Barron, has been voting so far this
session to please Senator Perkins and;
ex-Assemblyman Price. It is suggested
by his friends in Sonoma County that
he ought to change his programme and
-. vote to please the people who elected
â¢ him to the Legislature.
The document signed by certain mem
bers of the executive committee of- the
.Republican State Central Committee
has not yet reached the "organization"
in this city. It is known here that sig
natures were obtained in San Fran
cisco. The feeling here among Repub
licans who care for party success in
the future is in "favor of eliminating
' both Grant and Burns from the contest.
On this basis -harmony can be restored
and a creditable Senator chosen.
â¢ Assemblymen who have been voting
for Burns were seen to-night. They
- expressed the opinion that something
â¢in the way of aggressive work in the
direction of detaching men from the
Grant camp would be pressed as soon
as the report of the Investigating com
â¢ mittee is submitted to the House- When
It transpired late to-night that the re
port of the committee would not white
â¢ wash Grant, Green or Wright, the Bulla
forces manifested considerable delight.
Bulla and his lieutenants estimate that
they will get the support of a majority
.' of the Grant men. Inquiry all along
the line discloses the information that
â¢â¢ "General Barnes Is the second choice of
.-â¢.â¢many of the Grant men. Should the
â¢â. ' Grant forces dissolve Barnes is likely
to be the chief gainer. What is more
. 'significant still is the fact that Barnes
seems to be the second choice. of the
Burns men. They admit his popularity
and his eminent services to the party.
â¢ .: Irving M. Scott will return to San
' Francisco to-morrow. He may decide
to coma back to this city, and endea
. vor to put more vigor into . his cam
paign or he may conclude to await a
turn in the affairs of the contest. Mr.
Scott's reception has been civil and cor
dial, but he has not received much
political encouragement.

DENNERY WILL NOT
GET ASHES SEAT
. CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 26.â Leon Dennery will
not be a Senator from the Twenty
fourth District of California this year
nor for over three years yet to come, at
least. yy'-yy^-
The Call has information that the
committee, or at least a majority of It,
will decide the Dennery-Ashe contest
in favor of R. Porter Ashe.
There! never was anything to Den.
nery's contest for a seat in the Twenty
fourth Senatorial District. His evi
dence was submitted, but it made no
favorable -impression on the committee.
All day the committeemen have been
listening to the argument made by ex-
Senator Eugene Bert in behalf of Den
nery, and the technicalities he raised
as his reasons why the ; expressed
wishes of a majority of the voters in
the Twenty-fourth Senatorial District
should be overturned and Dennery
seated in the Senate to act as messen
ger boy for Daniel M. Burns.
At the conclusion of ex-Senator
Bert's argument the committee was
ready to render a decision, but Senator
Ashe's attorney started in on an argu
ment in his client's behalf to show the
very weak case Dennery had presented.
The committee will, in all probabil
ity, make a unanimous report in favor
of permitting Senator Ashe to retain
his seat, although there may be two
Senators who might bring in a minority
report. There are, on the other hand,
five who are known to be in* favor of
throwing out Dennery's contest.
The testimony in this foolish proceed
ing taken in San. Francisco made up
three large volumes of type-written
matter, in all nearly 4000 pages.
Senator Ashe and his brother, Will
Ashe, were the only two witnesses to
take the stand. Dennery may con
tinue in his position as messenger boy
to the colonel, but he will not be a
State Senator for a while at least.

matter and its manager, J. A. Filcher,
who had charge of California's exhibit
at Hamburg, was present in the As

"We are trying to get for California

have only 160,000 feet in all.
"One feature of our 'exhibit will be
a topographical map of San Francisco
Bay Ahich will illustrate our commer
cial advantages and shipping facilities
for trans-Pacific trade. We will also
have our collectors go out into the
State to gather in exhibits from the
timber section:, the mines and the ag
ricultural region. There will also.be
shown a number of Irving M. Scott's
models of California built warships and
ocean liners.
"I, of course, do not know whom Gov

to select one each from the northern,
central and southern sections of the
State." .
There are those who claim to know,
however, of two of the appointments
that will be made. Assemblyman Val
entine is one and Mr. Filcher himself
another, though Hon. E. F. Adams, a

Central California and if this be so he
will, of course, be an opponent of Mr.
Filcher. *

BOYCE WANTS TO HELP
THE MERCHANT MARINE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 26.â Senator Boyce of Santa
Barbara to-day introduced a joint resolu
tion asking Congress to take action to
bolster up the merchant marine. The res
olution was as follows:
Whereas, Our experience during the recent
war with Spain has demonstrated the great
advantages to any government arising from
an adequate fleet of auxiliary steamships, from
which such government can be supplied in
cases of great emergency, and has also demon
strated the comparative Inadequacy of our
merchant marine to the necessities of our peo
ple, either In peace or war; and
Whereas, The experience of all the leading
nations of the- world has shown that a mer
chant marine can be fostered and developed
by a prudent extension of the policy of sub
sidizing lines of modern vessels for the trans
portation of mails upon the ocean; and
Whereas, The extension of our possessions
and the development of our commerce now de
mands and . the superior skill displayed by
American workmen In marine architecture jus
tifies the Federal Government in adopting; a
liberal policy for the building up of our ocean
carrying trade; now, there, be it

SAN FRANCISCO'S
NEW CHARTER IS
HOT IN DANGER
Rumor of Its Possible
Nullification.
BILL IN ASSEMBLY SCARES
AN ACT FOB, REORGANIZATION
OF MUNICIPALITIES.
The Measure Is Intended to Effect
Only Those Towns That Are
Being Governed Without
Charters.
Considerable alarm has been, occa
sioned in this city by the persistent
rumors that have been given circula
tion, both here and in. Sacramento, to
the effect that the new charter was in
danger of being practically wiped out
or nullified by the passage of a bill re
cently introduced in the Legislature en
titled "An act to provide for the re
organization of municipal corporations
and for determining the population
thereof." y :[ i:
There is no occasion for alarm. The
charter is an accomplished fact, and no
legislation is pending or contemplated
that is likely to affect it one way or
another. The rumors were probably
started by opponents of the charter,
although for what purpose it is difficult
to imagine. They may have been de
luded Into believing that the proposed
bill was really aimed at San Francisco's
charter.
The bill referred to provides "that the
legislative. body of any municipal cor-
poration upon receiving a petition for
the reorganization of said corporation
under a higher or lower class, signed
by not less than one-fifth of the quali
fied electors of said corporation, as
shown. by the vote cast at the last
municipal election held therein, shall
submit to the electors of such city, at
a special election to be called within
two weeks after receiving such petition,
the question whether such city shall so
reorganize under and in accordance
with the provisions of this act."
Assembly bill 53 has been carefully
examined by Attorney Garret Mc-
Enerney, who says it has no i bearing
on the charter, or the municipal govern
ment of San Francisco. . v
"If this bill should become a law."
said Mr. McEnerney, "It would have no
effect on j any chartered : city. It would
only be supplemental to the municipal
corporation act of 1883, , and only j those
cities .'incorporated under that act
would be affected:
, "Chartered cities are, not divided into
classes, and this act clearly states that
it is for the purpose of; enabling, those
cities that are â¢ incorporated .under the
general incorporation act to reorganize
into ' a higher or. a lower: class, ' as - in
crease or decrease in population may
make advisable." '; :
OPPOSED TO CORRECTING
AN OLD BOARD'S MINUTES
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 26.â An important meeting
of the State Board of Examiners was held
with closed doors to-day. : Ex-Attorney
General Fitzgerald went before' the board
and requested, that the minutes of a meet
ing held during the administration of Gov
ernor Budd should be amended to .show
that favorable action was j taken on % the
claim : of -I. H. Polk, expert, of the Rail
road Commission.. The amount of the
claim is $7700. The record shows that ac
tion was postponed, on the motion to al
low the , claim, although the approval
was favored by Governor Budd. ; Mr. Fitz
gerald, in presenting his statement to the
meeting â¢ to-day, * said * that the minutes
were not correct; as the claim was allowed
and not postponed. : , ' ,-â¢ y--, 2-. r. 'â 'â â  â â¢ '< - â¢
The ex-Attorney â¢ General â¢ proposed to

minutes of the meeting should be cor
rected by the adoption of a resolution set
ting forth 11 at he appeared before the
board to-day and submitted facts show
ing that the State Board of Examiners
had at a prior meeting approved the claim
of the said Polk, and that he (Fitzgerald)
voted for the allowance of the sum
named. ' [&Â£'*< â >:
Rumor says the session was. somewhat
animated. Governor Gage refused to stand
for any such change of the record as Mr.
Fitzgerald suggested, and his fellow mem
bers supported him in the stand. The Gov
ernor pointed out that there were two
ways open for the payment of Mr. Polk.
One was to apply to the court for an or
der directing the State Board of Exam
iners to allow the claim, and the other
was to apply to the Legislature for re
lief by a bill appropriating the amount
claimed. Governor Gage was firm in his
determination to resist a correction of
the minutes. He maintained that the
adoption of the method in this case would
open the door to the admission of other
claims on the same ground. Mr. Fitzger
ald insisted that the minutes should be
amended to show the real action of the
board, but his arguments did not change
the position of the Governor.
REGISTRAR BIGGY HAS
A REGISTRATION BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 26.-W. J. Blggy. the Regis
trar of Voters of San Francisco, is here
for the purpose of securing data and post
ing himself as to the condition of meas
ures affecting registration of voters and
primary elections. It is Mr. Biggy's de
sire that no laws shall be enacted which
are not in. conformity with and operative
under the new charter of San Francisco.
One bill has been Introduced in the Sen
ate providing for voting by affidavit. This
would avoid the necessity for the publica
tion of registers other than by index, but
by some extraordinary oversight the city
of San Francisco is excluded from the
provisions of the act. â¢>
Until the new charter goes Into effect
the registration in San Francisco will be
taken under a law passed In, 1878, but un
der the provisions of the charter the city
Is brought within the jurisdiction of the
general law. .
In the proposed primary law there is a
provision providing that registration shall
commence forty-five days before the elec
tion and close not less than thirty days
prior thereto.
Section 1094 of the present registration
law, is unconstitutional In that- it is
claimed to be unjust and It is alleged that
no one has a right to pass specifically.
A bill has also been introduced -in the
Senate which provides that the heading of
three political parties shall be printed at
the head of every ballot and by putting a
cross opposite "Democratic." "Republi
can,", or "Populist" one person can, if he
desires to do so, by one cross vote the en
tire straight ticket, or If he desires to
vote for one or more candidates of an
other party he can do so by putting a"
cross opposite their names. i
The bill which Mr. Blggy is urging is in
substance as follows:
, Section 1004. A register, .in which shall be
entered th- names of the qualified electors of
each of the counties in the State, shall be kept
at ihe office of â¢ the County Clerk of such
county, and in each of . the cities and counties
In the State such a register shall be kept ln
the office of the person charged with the reg
istration of voters in such . city and county.
There' shall be In each of the counties and
cities and counties in the State (where regis
tration is. now required by law to take place
previous'to each general election, and in other
counties, or cities and ' counties, when i re
quired by the Board of Supervisors or other
board having charge and control of elections),
a. J new and complete registration of the voters
of such counties and 'cities and counties who
are entitled-, thereto and who apply with the
proper proof. Such registration i shall com-'
mence at least general election and
shall continue ~ 'â  â - â next ensuing, .; when
such registration shall cease. Â Every.' landlord,
or keeper- ot any premises where lodgers abide,
shall keep a list of the names ;of all lodgers
occupying rooms or sleeping apartments or
beds in' th?' premises under, his control, - com
mencing such list on the one. hundredth day
previous to any election, i and such list shall
be kept daily, so as to be ready for reference
and inspection by the Board. of Election Com
missioners or a clerk delegated by them for
that â¢ purpose. Blank lists shall be furnished
to every, landlord or keeper of premises whet
lodgers - abide and shall be. collected dally by
order of â¢' the Election Commissioners: .such
blanks shall be ruled in columns 'showing the
name of . the lodger, | the . number of. room and
the story of ;: the 'building,'- and ,at any timey
from the beginning of registration to the day
of election shall be furnished to the Board of
Election Commissioners upon their, request
therefor. ,- â  .' .
, Any. landlord | or keeper, of premises where
lodgers abide neglecting or refusing to comply
with the provisions of this act shall be deemed
to be: guilty of a- misdemeanor, and on convic
tion thereof shall â¢ be fined â¢ the / sum of fifty
dollars, . and ! in the event of â ; non-payment of
such fine shall be committed to the County Jail
for a term of days at the rate of one dollar
per day for each dollar mof .said fine. Any
voter registered in premises In which the land
lord â¢â  or keeper neglects, or. refuses to .comply
with this act shall be cited to appear before
the Election Commissioners within five (5) days
In order to verify his right to vote. It shall
be considered a proper. citation to such voter if
the citation, is addressed to the name of the
party registered, the number of room and place
of registration,, and. If the party cited does
not appear in answer to . the citation at the
time appointed his â¢ name- shall be stricken

of $120,000 for California's exhibit at the
Paris Exhibition in . 1900. The measure
passed with only six votes against it and

requested him to explain the bill, and
after he had done so It was passed with
out dissent.
Assembly bill 42, by Kelly of Oakland,
provides that paid firemen should have
annual vacations without loss of pay, and
it precipitated a good bit of discussion,
but was finally passed.. It is intended to'

PURE FOOD BILL RECOM
MENDED FOR PASSAGE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 26.â The Dockery bill came
up before the Committee on Health and
Quarantine to-day so much amended that
it could scarcely be recognized, though It
still retained the same laudable object for
which It was first designed.
Mr. Dockery's original provided that a
State commission be created by guberna
torial appointment for the purpose of in
specting all food oroducts manufactured
in or snipped into tne State. The com
missioners to De appointed were author
ized to appoint agents whose duty It
should be to inspect all canned goods and
Other food products that are ever adulter
ated or counterfeited, and in cases where
they found fraud, confiscate the goods
without further ado. Under the present
system there are only a few of the coun
ties that have food regulations/and it is
the custom of the manufacturer or job
ber to take back confiscated goods and
ship them to some quarter of the State
where pure-food laws do not operate. This
practice it is the object of the Dockery
ill to do away with. Dockery talked his
original bill over with the Governor and
found that he was opposed to more com
missions, so he has so amended the bill
that the food inspections bureau will be
simply a department of State Board of
Health. In* this way he figures that the
expense of maintaining a separate com
mission will be obviated and the same
good accomplished at the minimum cost.
The bill was recommended for passage by
the committeee.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MEN'IO. Jan. 26.â "The Republican
* - of the State of California, in
State conventii _ assembled, hereby de
clares itself un .Iterably â nosed to con-
vict bor being brought into competi
tion with fre- labor and hereby pledges
itself in support of any measure de

and â¦he Industries of our State against

"And we are in favor of the passage
of 8 h laws as wi ise such con
victs to be employed upon the public
highways of this State, thereby with
drawing them from competition with
free labor in all branches of industry."
âExtract from the platform of the Re
publican party.
The fight that was begun before this
Legislature opened against the inter
ests of free labor and in favor of the
State prison ring Is on in dead earnest
and it is not a single-handed affair, as
the first assault begun in the Assembly
would Indicate. It is as well organized
and cleverly conceived a scheme as has
ever looked to legislative enactment for
its consummation and It behooves the
friends of the freeman to look well to
its interests.
The opening gun was fired when As
eemblyni-n Knights of Sacramento in
troduced on Wednesday an amendment
to the bill offered in the Assembly by
Speaker pro tern. Alden Anderson of
Solano. The bill provided that the
crushed rock turned out by the rock
crusher at Folsom should not be sold
. to private contractors In cities, but
should oily be sold to Boards of Su
. pervisors for the purpose of building
county or State roads. The amendment
of Mr. Knights nullified the bill by pro
viding that the rock should be sold to
private contractors to be used on city
streets. In other words Mr. Anderson
; desired to give the owner of a private
quarry a chance to make his legitimate
profit and the free man who labored
for him the opportunity to earn his
daily wage. The amendment of Mr.
. Knights was intended to work to the
contrary end.
The- bill and the amendment were re
..'â  ferred to the Committees on State
.-.Prisons and Labor and Capital and last
'. evening they went on a junketing trip j
to Folsom State Prison. They were i
met by Warden Aull, they were boun- |
:â :' teously dined and copiously wined and '
'.the warden read his ready-made report. ;
Then they went over the prison prop- j
city, looked at the dam. Interviewed the !
rock crush, and returned to the din
â¢. ing-room to come to the conclusion that
â  the crusher was the best friend the free j
'; man has in the State. When they got j
â¢ back here this morning ihey decided j
â¢â¢': that Mr. Anderson's bill should be |
.amended by killing it and If present
â¢ ! plans are follow ed they will so report
; ''..to the house.
The assassination of the Anderson
. ; bill is but the first step. The next is
to be taken by Senator "Eddie" Wolfe
â¢of San Francisco. Mr. Wolfe is at pres
ent engaged in "working hard," as he I
puts it. in a letter to a friend, over a j
bill that has for its object the installa
tion of a wire nail making machine In
each of the State prisons. The product
of the machines is to enter Into compe
tition with that now in the market, the
product of free labor.
Mr. Wolfe's bill bears all of the un
lovely features of a lead pipe cinch and
",â¢ a generous lobby is expected here
â¢ to fight it. Every nail made to
. -day pays its profit to the trust
organized in 1597, but every one
of them is turned out by a free
laborer, who receives a salary above
. most of the men engaged in almost
any other line of ordinary mechanics.
It is against the pay of these men that
Mr. Wolfe intends to direct the unpaid
labor of the convict. That Mr. Wolfe's
bill is not to the best Interests of the
trade is best demonstrated by the cor
respondence that has passed back and
' forth between the members, agents and
officers of the Manufacturers' and Pro
: . ducers' Association and other commer
cial organizations of San Francisco.
;. When he first conceived the idea of
prison made nails Mr. Wolfe wrote to
the representative of one of San Fran
- Cisco's largest wholesale and retail j
' â¢ hardware firms declaring his intention
-.and asking the price of nail making
.... machines.
: This was before the ' Legislature was
. .convened. The hardware man answered
Mr. Wolfe, but immediately made the
Scheme known to the Manufacturers'
elation, and It directed its mana
': ger. Oscar Lewis, to be on hand in Sac
' ramento and use every honorable
means to beat the bill. To accomplish
this Mr. Lewis is now in this city and
â¢ was with the combined committees
â¢ when they visited Warden Aull yes
'-.â  terday. Though he was not prepared,
-he made a hard fight against the kill
- ing off of the Anderson bill, but the
dinner and the suavity of the Prison
,'â¢ Director was more than he could over
come and he scored his first partial
' -failure. He is. however, not discour
aged and is making himself ready for
â¢_â¢'â  the hie fieht that is to come when Sen
ator Wolfe attempt* to override his
\ party platform and the interests of free
labor with his little wire nail enact
â¢â  ment, which is expected to appear in
â¢.'the Senate In the early part of next
â¢. -.'week. _______

NEW YORK, Jan.. 26.â A Philadelphia
special to the Herald says: The dis
patch from* London containing sensa

discussed in medical circles here.
: Dr. Elwood R. Kerby, a member of

"All the work in this great institu

said Dr. Kerby, "is in the line of ex
perimental and teaching purposes. The
authority of the hospital Is almost su

burled by the hospital at the Govern
ment's expense. While I was taking a
course at the general hospital thirty
or forty persons, male and female, were
Inoculated with the germs of a loath
some disease that its Initial lesion
might be studied. This experiment was
made on peasants and very poor peo
ple.
"In malarial cases, while the physi

suffer chill after chill before quinine

DIED IN POVERTY.
End of One of the Best Known
Â« Gamblers of Early Days.
GILROY. Jan. 26.â Burke, an * old
time gambler, well known all over the
State, died this morning at the County
Infirmary near San Jose. For over twenty
years Burke had resided In Gilroy. He
was taken to the Infirmary a few months
ago to be properly cared for, as he had no
relatives in this country, and his ad
vanced years made him almost helpless.
Burke was born in Canada, and was al
most 80 years of age. He was a Mexican
war veteran, a hero of Buena Vista. In
early days he worked for John Parrott,
who has since become rich. This was in
the City of Mexico. He came to this
Stale with ex-Mayor Bryant of San Fran
cisco, and during the early gold excite
ment at Virginia City was a partner of
"Bill" Briggs. â >
By gambling and speculations he made
considerable money. His purse was al
ways open, and when the Civil War broke
out, being a sympathizer of the South,
where he resided for a number of years,
he gave $5000 to the Confederate fund
raised In California.
Burke had changed his name In early
days. His right name was Jean Beau
reau, as near as can be learned. The re
mains will be brought to Gilroy for Inter
ment.

Though the rules clearly state that a
game of water polo shall consist of two
fifteen minute .halves, with three minutes'
rest at half-time, the Bull Frogs loudly in
sisted that they would play for twenty
minutes only, as the water in the tank
was too; cold to permit of longer Immer
sion. Referee John Elliott reluctantly
consented to the Bull Frogs* proposition,
and a fast and furious. game was soon in
progress. Ducking, scrimmaging and com
plaints of foul play were in order, the' air
being: filled with shouts and screams that
almost drowned the referee's whistle. Af
ter a. goal had been, gained on both sides,
one of . the_,Pollywogs attempted to' drag
Goal-keeper Kreling Into the tank, and
got kicked on the ear for his pains. There
upon: a : storm of protest and recrimina
tion ensued., until John Elliott wisely re
fused to referee such a game any longer,
and the contest was called off, neither
side being able to claim a victory. .
' The water-polo game was preceded by a
potato race In the gymnasium, for which
the following entered: Bush, Burgess,
Klarman. Olsen, Stone. McCarty, Mona
han, Kreling, Saunders and Conlev. There
were twenty-five potatoes placed at inter
vals of one yard; the total distance to be

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Jan. 26.â was a bad day for
the prosecution in the preliminary ex
amination of Jesse Walters, charged
with the murder of Alfred Cook. V ; v
I. Metcalf, heretofore considered one
of the strongest, if not the most im
portant, witness against Walters, gave
testimony that caused exultation in the
camp of the defense. It was that the
first two shots fired in McKenzie's
stable appeared to him t > have come
from the box stall, in which Cook was
killed, and he further testified that
when he looked toward the place where
Walters was standing he saw no smoke
about Walters' pistol, nor any smoke
coming from the box stall. His reason
for thinking the shots came from with
in the box stall was that they sounded
"dead."
When the prosecution rested its case
at the afternoon session Justice Wil
liam Bradford, before whom the hear
ing was being held, startled every one
by announcing that unless the prosecu
tion presented more evidence to show
that Cook had been killed in cold blood
he would discharge the prisoner. This
caused District Attorney Bell to rise
and charge the court with "talking a
little rashly and recklessly."
An explanation followed by the Jus
tice to the effect that he had understood
that when the prosecution rested Its
case and objected to certain testimony
on behalf of the defense it was proposed
to cut off the defense from submitting
evidence altogether. On being assured
that such was not the case he modified
his original dictum and said he was
prepared to hear the defense before
rendering judgment in the matter.
-It is the confident belief of the de
fense, based on to-day's developments,
that the release of Walters will be or
dered. They anticipate, however, that
he will be immediately re-arrested. In
fact, the District Attorney stated that
had Walters been discharged to-day
he would have had him brought before
the Superior Court. , Should the ac
cused be held or discharged and rear
rested the defense intimates that it will
resort* to habeas corpus proceedings to
secure the prisoner's entire freedom or
his release on. bail.
Attorney Beerstecher, who repre
sents Walters, made, a significant ex
periment this afternoon immediately
following the adjournment of the court.
He procured a 38-caliber revolver, load
ed it with smokeless powder cartridges
of the same make as those found in the
weapon surrendered by Walters, and
had It discharged at the spot Where
Jesse Walters Is said to have stood by
I. Metcalf. He had Justice Caldwell
stand in the position Metcalf stood, ac
cording to the latter's testimony to
day, when he turned to see whence
the first two shots had come on that
fatal sth of January. Tom Pickett fired
two shots in quick succession, and as
soon as Caldwell heard the first report
he swung around toward Pickett, and
declares he saw cmoke, though but a
slight cloud, near the outstretched re
volver in the hand of Pickett! An em
ploye of the stable witnessed the test
and states that he also saw the smoke
after the shots were fired. This testi
mony will be used by the defense to
prove, in conjunction with the testi
mony of witness Metcalf, that Cook
must have fired the first shots
and that Walters only fired in
self-defense. The defense sprung a
surprise on the prosecution at the af
ternoon session of the court by serving
a subpena on Sheriff Dunlap, demand
ing "that he produce in court the trunk
and contents thereof, property in his
lifetime of Mr. Al Cook, alias Al Door
man, now in your possession, and all
property and effects of said deceased,
Including all papers, books, pictures
and letters, in your possession or under
your control."
This trunk is now in the possession of
the Sheriff and is supposed to contain
letters and other evidence showing the
relations that existed between Cook and
Mrs. Walters. Among the letters in
the trunk the defense expects to find
one written by Mrs. Walters to Cook
Informing the latter of the chance for
employment in the stable of McKenzie.
It is known that among Cook's effects
in the trunk is a tintype of Mrs. Wai
ters, sent to Cook while he was at Palo
Alto. This will figure as an exhibit in
the case. A contest is expected over
the production of the trunk and its con
tents. . : : . . '
Mrs. Walters was an interested and
sad-faced spectator of the proceodim-.s.
but sat apart from her husband. The
latter was conspicuously the most
cheerful of the pair. .
Ex-Sheriff McKenzie succeeded, to
day in securing bail and was released
from custody. The sureties on his
bond, which is for twice the sum of his
ball, and t the amounts in which they
qualified are as follows: F. Booreo.
$3000; Ann Maher, $800; P. J. Seinel.
$1000; Thomas McÃain, $3000: Henry
Brown, $2000; C. F. Hargrave; $5000: J.
F.Zollner, $5000; George E. Goodman.
$5000; Henry Fowler, $5000: Charles
Reams, $1000: J. H. Shlvely. $1200; J. A.
McClelland. $5000; C. Malandrlno. $2000;
Joseph Dixon, $500; L. H. Gunn. $2500:
M. C. Dillon, $5000: George Head. $3000.
He experienced considerable difficulty
in securing bondsmen, and many of his
sureties acted in that capacity simply
out of regard for his sick wife.
George A. Knight came up to-day and
will aid in .-.the defense of McKenzie
should his services be deemed neces
sary.- He T was in attendance at the
hearing. "The court room was well
filled.. \
Metcalf, was the first and most im
portant witness. He was the only per
son present, at the killing of Cook in
addition to Walters and McKenzie. He
testified that on the morning. of Thurs
day, January 5, â. he was ' passing ': Mc-
Kenzie's stable on ! his .way home, when
McKenzie, who was standing, inside the
stable, within about ten feet / of, ,the
door, asked him [ to step inside and con
tinue j negotiations, concerning, the ex
change of horses, which had been com
menced on the preceding.: Tuesday.
About . a minute later Walters came in
and walked to the extreme rear of the
stable opposite the box stall in which
Cook was killed. - Witness heard two
shots, turned suddenly in -.the direc
tion from which they had 'seemed, to
come, and saw the accused facing the
door of the box stall, and in his ex
tended hand a pistol aimed toward the
box stall. He heard no remark made
by Walters, but admitted that Walters
might have greeted McKenzie without
his hearing it. though he was inclined
to think that no greeting had taken
place. When his attention was drawn
toward the point whence the shots had
come, McKenzie was standing between
him and the box stall, about eight or ;
ten feet distant, with his nack partly j
toward the witness. The shots ap- ;
peared to have come from the box
stall. He judged so from the dead
sound. The shots were close together.
He ran from the stable as soon as he
realized that a shooting fracas was on.
and went directly home.
Under cross-examination by Attorney
Beerstecher, Metcalf testified that Mc-
Kenzie had urged him to enter the sta
ble and that he had demurred, stating
that he had no time. He had no inten
tion of entering the stable until asked
by McKenzie to do so. Â£ He heard the
reports very soon after Walters entered
the stable. He thought from the re
ports that the shots came from the box
stall from their sound, but did not know
who fired the shots. He saw no smoke
about Walters' pistol, nor did he see
any smoke "coming from the box stall.
He saw no smoke anywhere. Walters'
pistol was not poked into the box stall.
The accused as standing, three or four
feet from the door of the box stall.
Sheriff Dunlap reiterated his testi
mony given at the Coroner s inquest re- j
garding his being summoned to the
scene of the tragedy and finding the re
volver at Cook's side in a changed po- j
sition at a later inspection of the scene
from that which it had occupied when
he first viewed the body and its sur
roundings. ' ;t.' â¢
Coroner, R. M. Kyser, Dr. D. E. Os
born and Dr. Haun testified to the post
mortem examination - and established
the fact that death resulted from bul
let wounds. Dr. Haun testified there
were no powder marks on Cook's
clothes. George W. Amen, a Deputy
Sheri.f,* gave evidence . regarding the
arrest of Walters and the latter's sur
render of his revolver.- He further tes
tified to having seen Walters lounging
about the corner of Second and Main
streets shortly before the shooting oc- j
curred. This -is about a block from j
McKenzie's stables. Under Sheriff Daly
testified to havii. -" received Walters'
pistol from Amen,- and to the powder
from one of the shells having been ex
tracted for determining its character.
Frank Weston, the complaining wit
ness, testified to his identification of
the body of the slain man. ' J. Erring
ton, a former, employe in the saloon of
Jesse Walters at Oakvllle, testified to
a meeting between Cook and Walters,
near the saloon on December 26, 1896,
and to a conversation between the two
men. He had overheard only scraps of
the talk. .. Coo* said: "I am not afraid
of any one." Cook left town on the
sOuth-bound train a day or two after
ward: Subsequent to this he heard
Walters remark while in the saloon, at
the mention of Cook's name: "If the â
â â ever .'comes back I'll kill him."
Witness had heard before the time of
the conversation that there was trouble
between Cook and Walters.
Sheriff Dunlap testified that he had
employed .William. West to extract the
powder from one of the shells in Wal
ters' pistol and that the powder was
of a light color. William West stated
that the powder was of the smokeless
kind. John C. Grigsby, who was Wal
ters' barkeeper during the latter part
of 1896 and the early months of 1897,
testified that one day he heard Cook
say to Walters, "To with you."
Cook then ; walked away and Walters
left in the opposite direction. He also
had. heard Walters remark. in reference
to Cook, "If he don't; mind his own
business I'll make him." . ' â - .-.â â¢'â ;
* "Do you remember stating to me,"
asked District Attorney Bell. "that you
recollected that Walters said, "The
â â - â , If he meddles with my private
affairs I will fix him?" .
"Yes." responded tho witness, "but 1
don't think he referred to Cook in those
words. He might have meant them.'be
cause they were great enemies. The-.'
were having trouble right along ful
some days." . . yy-y I
"This is our case; the prosecution
rests." concluded the District Attorney.
Attorney Beerstecher made Grigsby
a witness for the defense and attempt
ed to examine him regarding threats
made by Cook against Walters. Dis
trict Attorney Bel objected 'on the
ground that no foundation had been
laid for evidence of this kind, which he
sad was evidently Intended to estab
lish self-defense. He objected to this
testimony at that time. Justice Brad
ford failed to catch the point of Bell's
objection, j jumping to the . conclusion
that Bell was endeavoring to entirely
shut out the defense from a hearing.
This led him to make this brief and
unexpected address to Bell: ',-'
"I say, now distinctly that , If you
have no more evidence I shall never
hold Mr. Walters to answer." ::./;
\ Bell flushed, rose to his feet and In
terrupted the' court by saying. "I think,
your Honor, you are talking a little
rashly and recklessly."
His Honor was not to be stopped,
however. "If you will give me some
evidence." he continued, "to show that
Mr. Walters shot down ; Conk In cold
blood, and will then give Walters a
chance to answer, your testimony." '
Beerstecher here , interrupted. "I
understood your Honor to say that If
the prosecution "had rested its case,
and '-would .- Introduce Vno further
evidence in the ' case, consider
ing, the evidence; before your
Honor, j you were of the opinion that
there Is not sufficient evidence to hold
Mr. Walters for the crime of murder."
.Bell attempted to get in a word, but
Justice Bradford : shut him off, saying.
"I understood Mr. â â  Bell ,to say : that he
had no further evidence to present and
that he was going to stop the defense
from getting in its side of the matter,
but he afterward said that Walters
could bring in his defense, but that this
witness' evidence was not admissible.
I then said that unless the defendant
was given a chance to put in evidence I
would dismiss him, whether it was law
or not.'
A general clearing up of the situation
followed, and owing to the Illness of
Mrs. Ray of San Francisco, who Was to
have testified, the proceedings were
postponed until 9:30 o'clock to-morrow
morning.

DRAMATIC DEFENSE
OF COMMISSARY
GENERAL EAGAN
Goaded to Madness by the Insin
uation That He Murdered
Soldiers for Gain.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â The feature of the proceedings before the
Eagan court-martial to-day was the testimony, dramatic in many parts
in its quiet' intensity, of Commissary General Eagan himself. Not
more than fifteen or twenty people outside of the court and a dozen or
so of newspaper correspondents were admitted to the trial rooms. Sev
eral witnesses preceded the chief figure in the trial. General Eagan lis
tened intently to the testimony of these witnesses, and occasionally, held
brief whispered conferences with his counsel. He was dressed in full
uniform, without sword, and his florid face, white hair and mustache
and soldierly, bearing recalled to many the late General Sheridan, to
whom he bears a distinct resemblance. His call to the stand this morn
ing was something of a surprise, as it had been thought if-. he testified
at all it would be later. When his name was called he rose, and standing
before the witness chair raised his right hand, took the oath administered
by the judge advocate and at first related his army career. As he pro
ceeded in his testimony it became apparent that the line of defense would
be justification and extreme provocation, finally bringing on a serious
nervous condition which rendered the witness unfit for business and
made him to a degree irresponsible for his acts. The President's order
of immunity, it was .also made evident, would be relied on as applica
ble to General Eagan's testimony before the war commission, and that
the court-martial had no proper jurisdiction of the case. When General
Eagan began the story- General Miles' aspersion on him, he raised his
voice somewhat and spoke with great earnestness, though with perfect
enunciation. In speaking of the criticisms of the .newspapers, which he
said had been called forth by General Miles' testimony, his manner was
intensely dramatic and impressive. His eyes filled with tears and his
voice trembled, and the impression he. left with many was decidedly
favorable. After the court adjourned several members shook his hand
and in a friendly way asked after his health.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â When the
Eagan court-martial "reassembled to
*_ty Judge Advocate Davis stated that
he wished to submit formally the tes
timony of -General Miles as' read yes
terday as an exhibit in this, trial, and
with this statement, he said, the prose
cution rested its case.
Mr. Worthington, counsel for Gen
eral Eagan, read several exhibits In
connection with the testimony given at
yesterday's session of the court. These
inclrded the, correspondence' between
General Miles and General Eagan,
through the adjutant general, in which
the latter asked as to whether the in
terview published -In - New York news
paper, in which General Miles is alleged
to have severely criticized the commis
sary general's department, was au
thoritative. Extracts from the alleged
interview were also read and submitted
as part of the record.
Colonel W. L. Alexander, U. S. A., of
the Subsistence Department, was the
first witness called by. the defense. He
said he returned to Washington from
Jamaica on the morning of the day
General Eagan gave his testimony be
fore the War Investigating Commis
sion. General Eagan, he said, was
hastily going over papers in connection
with his testimony and showed signs
of great excitement. General Eagan
nervously handled the papers and wit
ness had rarely seen a man in such a
nervous condition. His manner was so
exceptional Chat he asked Colonel Davis
of the .Commissary .Department, who
was present, whether the general was
not ill. He had been intimately con
nected with General Eagan, but never
before had he seen him in such a con
dition. ' â¢'-
General Merritt asked whether, to his
knowledge, General Eagan had con
sulted any one as to the substance .of
his testimony to be presented to the
commission. Colonel Alexander an
swered that, BO far as he knew. General
Eagan had not.
Colonel George B. Davis, assistant to
Commissary General Eagan, was the
next witness. He testitfied that he
had been very closely associated with
General Eagan during the last several
months. He was in the office the day
General Miles gave his testitmony be
fore the War Investigating Commis
sion, and as soon as General Eagan
saw the published statement of his tes
timony he became considerably. excited
and wrote to General Miles, asking as
to the truth of. the interview published
with General Miles. As time went on
his excitement increased to such an
extent that he did not and apparently
could not attend to the duties of his
office. Later on General Eagan reached
such a state that he could not attend
to any business. The day before Gen
eral Eagan appeared before the com
mission, he read his statement to the
witness, who urged him to modify it
somewhat, but he would not listen, and,
walking up and down the room, said
he ' would not change a word of it.
Newspaper clippings were constantly
being received, criticizing General Ea
gan, and these greatly increased his ex
citement. Some of these clippings car
ried the Idea that General Eagan was
a murderer,. and that he had acted cor
ruptly in sending unfit food to the
army. During these days the witness
said that General Eagan was wholly
unfitted to perform the ordinary duties
of his office.' Up to this time the gen
eral had been a hard worker and never
before had exhibited any signs of nerv
ous strain. . :
In answer to questions Colonel Davis
said that General Hasan's conduct of
his office was perfectly honest and he
had always had the good of the service
at Heart, more so than any other com
missary general of whom the witness
had ever known or heard. The witness,
again referring to General Eagan's tes
timony before the commission, said
that he had not been consulted in its
preparation, but, at the general's re
quest, had supplied some of. the rec
ords. The general- had asked him at
one time as to his judgment concern
ing the argument he had prepared for
the commission and the witness had
replied that it was a complete answer
to the criticisms which had been made
against him Abut he had advised that
some parts or it be omitted. General
Eagan, however, was greatly excited
and wit-ess thought he would bring
the matter to his attention more ur
gently the next -morning, but witness
did not then have a good opportunity.
'General Eagan had told the witness
that he was prevented from proceeding
in military, fashion against | General
Miles by .the President's order of im
munity to witnesses, but that he hoped
to he able to proceed in the matter in
the civil courts. 'Hy^iyy,
Miss Millard, General Eagan's stenog
rapher, was then called. Che had taken
.nearly all of the general's dictations
â since September 15 last and testified
that she took the dictation of the. gen
<eral's statement, before the commission.
At the time General Eagan gave his tes- ]
timony before the. commission he was j
greatly excited, nd while he was die- !
tating, his statement he walked the floor ;
in an excited way.. It had neveu been
His habit to wal": the floor while dictat
ing. The statement .was n:.. fully com
pleted until the day it ,w s presented
to the comr..issio_.' She saw. General
Eagan only a.few. minutes before he left
to appear before the , commission and
he was then in such, a nervous state
that his. hands trembled. The witness
thought that the general . had ' never
been able to read the statement through
as a whole ffo - . ', the' time it Was. begun
untilit was read to the commission.
,- Mr. Rogers, : clerk in the - office of the
commissary general, was the next wit
ness. He had, been in the office since
1811, and since General- Eagan came to
the .office he had seen him frequently
every day. . After General Miles* state
ment had been made public General
Eagan's appearance was greatly
changed. He looked haggard and worn
and at times was greatly excited. Wit
ness thought that General Eagan had
come to believe that public sentiment
was strong against. him, and that the
public had accepted General Males'
statement as true, and this worried
him greatly. As the days passed his
nervous disturbance greatly increased
until he appeared before the commis
sion. On one occasion the witness went
to General Eagan's desk and spoke to
him on a matter of office business. As
he approached the desk the general
said, apparently to himself: "I am a
murderer and for gain." This he re
peated several times in an absent
minded way. He did not appear to no
tice the witness.
General Eagan himself was the next
witness. He said he entered the volun
teer army in 1861 and in 1566 was made
a second lieutenant in the regular
army. He then briefly gave a history
of his military career, which included
several campaigns against the Indians.
He received a wound in the Modoc war
for which he received a brevet. During
the war with Spain he had been in his
office every day with one exception and
he had worked early and la"te. He had
given his testimony before the commis
sion under oath, preferably so. He had
first read General Miles' statement in
the Washington papers. For a long
time he feared that he might not be
called before the commission, but he
finally received a summons to appear.
Even then he was not fully prepared,
as his statement necessarily involved
the overhauling of records, etc. ,He
had held a conversation with. the. Sec
retary of War, in the course of which
he told. the Secretary thaf he desired
to defend himself by bringing proceed
ings against General Miles, . but was
told that the immunity granted by the
President would prevent any such ac
tion. Witness accepted this as a' fact,
but he did not think - this immunity
covered the newspaper interviews in
which General Miles had by inference
declared him to be a murderer for
gain. Witness said he became greatly
excited. This statement of' General
Miles, in the opinion of the witness, had
taken away his (Eagan's) character. He
could not proceed against General Miles
in the courts or otherwise, and he felt
that he might be better dead in the
gutter. _
During this recital General Eagan's
eyes filled with tears. His voice trem
bled, and he spoke very feelingly. His
honor as a soldier, he continued, had
been attacked, and a soldier's honor
should as sacred as the honor of a
woman. He had kept his sorrow to
himself. He had kept away from the
clubs and very soon found he could not
sleep. He felt that the people of this
country had come to believe that he
was a dishonest man. ,
"But I am an honest man," said the
general, with feeling, "and I believe
that no one who knows me will believe
that lam a dishonest man. My record
is clean, my uniform is unsullied, but I
have been slandered and wronged."
In answer to a question by his coun
sel as to whether, he had ever received
any benefit for any contract he had
made, General Eagan said, with great
In answer to a question by his coun
as to whether he had ever received
y benefit for any contract he had
de, General Eagan said, with great
"No, on my honor and before, my
God, not one cent's profit gain did I
ever receive, and yet my office his dis
bursed $19,000,000, and I am how a pb6r
man â so poor that I have not now suf
ficient money with' which' to pay your
fee." 2,\
As he (Eagan) understood public
sentiment, the public believed him to be
a murderer and for gain, and he said
he was greatly racked in body and
brain in consequence. He was goaded
to death and was very glad of a chance
to appear before the* commission and
through them 70,000,000 people in the
defense of his honor.
During this impassioned and impres
sive recital each member of the court
listened intently to every word spoken,
and every /eye was fastened upon, the
speaker.' The incident was dramatic
in the extreme. The witness spoke of
his mental and physical condition be
tween the time General Miles gave his
testimony and the time he himself had
appeared. He could not get rid of, the
thought that the country believed him
to be a murderer and for gain, and it
drove him nearly to distraction. .
Mr. Worthington then read a large
number of newspaper clippings, many
of .which spoke of General Eagan as a
scoundrel and . demanded his dismissal
from the army. ' At 12 o'clock Mr.
Worthington announced that he was
unable to proceed .with his case, as the
Secretary of War, whom he desired. to
call as a witness, was now before the
War | Investigating Commission and
could not appear. Thereupon the court
adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow. ,

TRAGIC DEATH OF FORMER
ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND
Falls With a Fatal Stroke of Apoplexy While
Arguing a Case in the United States
Supreme Court.
WASHINGTON, Jan. ' 26.â For-!
mer Attorney General Augus-'
tvs H. ' Garland was stricken
with apoplexy while address
ing;*,the United States Su
preme Court at ,12:15 o'clock this after
noon and died within ten minutes. The
occurrence came with startling and
tragic 'unexpectedness, changing the
usual â¢ caJm and dignity of the court
into temporary, confusion, while the
dying man was carried from the cham
ber in .a, futile effort to alleviate his
condition.
When'" the court convened at noon .
Mr. Garland resumed -an argument in
the case of â Towson vs. Moore, . which'
had begun yesterday. There was a full t .
bench, with" the- exception of Justices
Brewer and White. Mr. Garland spoke '
calmly and* with no evidence c_ agita-f |
tion or effort. . He had read from a vol- \
ume and had followed v with ' the sen
tence: "This, your Honors, is our con
tention.";yy:2:l
As the last word was uttered Mr.
Garland was seen to raise his hand and
then to gasp. He tottered and fell side
ways, striking against a chair and
overturning it as he fell heavily to the
floor. A succession of loud, deep gasps
came from him as* he lay on the floor.
His .associate in the case, Franklin
Mackey, was at once by. his side with
other counsel and officials. The head
of the dying man was raised, his shoes
removed and a draught of water given :
him. A deadly pallor had over
spread his a face, but this soon gave
place to a deep purple, which foretold
the gravity of the attack. He was
carried from the chamber across to the
room of Chief Clerk . McKenney, and
there placed on a sofa. Senator Gal
linger, who is a physician, was near at
hand. A single glance told him that
the attack would be fatal, and within
ten minutes from the time of the
stroke Mr. Garland breathed his last.
The court meantime had postponed the
case in which Mr. Garland was inter
ested and proceeded with other busi
ness.
It is said that never before in the
history of the United States Supreme
Court has :an attorney been stricken
with death while making an argu
ment there. There have been cases in
which counsel have fainted, stricken
with illness, but no case in which death
has followed within a few minutes, as
happened to-day. "-,
After the death of the former At
torney General became known the Su
preme Court adjourned for the day.
This action was taken on the motion of
Attorney General Griggs. In recogniz
ing the motion Chief Justice Fuller
said: "The court learns of the death
of r. MGarland with sincere sorrow,
and concurs in the suggestion that has
been made. Out of respect to the. mem
ory of this distinguished member of the
est tracts to be planted: are the Deonardt
and Capltan 520-acre tract and the A. F.
Maulhardt 450-acre tract. The planting of
beet seed under the supervision of the
sugar factory agriculture department will
commence about February 15 and con
tinue until May 1. The harvesting will,
commence about the Ist of August, con
tinuing until the close of the season in
the latter part of November. The rainfall
during the month of January in the vicin
ity of Oxnard was over six Inches, and
the factory officials are confident of an
extra good sugar beet season.
INGENIOUS DEVICE
OF A FIRE FIEND
/Mechanical Contrivance Found in a
Partly Burned Building in Fresno
Which Started the Flames. ..
FRESNO, Jan. 26.â Officers, have discov
ered an ingenious device of a firebug in
the building of F. S. Markarian, which
took fire at an early hour this morning.
Underneath a bench of some kind ln the
storeroom was found a piece of board, at
tached to which was a common alarm
clock, with the minute hand missing and
the hour hand pointing to the hour of 5.
Running the length of the board was a
wooden trigger attached at the top to the
mechanism of the clock. The lower end
of this trigger . or lever was broken or
burned off. It was long enough originally
to reach an iron file which was fastened
diagonally across the bottom of the base
board The suposlWon 'Is that the
mechanism of the clock was so arranged
that at a set hour the lever would have
drawn aside so that the bottom end would
pass a bundle of. matches across the. file
and thus start the fire. ' This piece of
mechanism was found in that portion
of the storeroom where the flames were
thickest. Not far away were discovered
two charred portions of a box which fitted
nicely together and evidently had been a
portion of the machine Inclosing the file
and the match end of the lever.,, It . is
supposed this box contained combustible
material which the matches first set fire
to after the mechanism had set the lever
to move.- = __'_.___ â¢
There was also .noticed about the prem
ises a very strong odor of kerosene. While
' no- doubt* is entertained by the fire de*
I partment officials that the fire was of in
cendiary origin, it is- not known who
placed that infernal machine in the store

The news of General Garland's death
produced a profound sadness in the
Senate, where he had served for * many
years as one of a galaxy of distin
guished men.
Word of the tragedy was soon noised
through the. Capitol and Senators and
Representatives hurried to the court
room. The two Arkansas Senators.
Messrs. Berry and Jones, were among
the first to view the body, and follow
ing them was a long line of persons,
high in legislative and legal circles,
who had been associated with Mr.
Garland at various times in his long
and notable public service.
Augustus H." Garland was born in
Tufton County, Tennessee, June 11, 1832.
and received his education at St. Mary's
College, Lebanon, Ky., and at St. Jo
seph's College, Bardstown, in the same
State. He was admitted to the bar in
1853, and began practice in Arkansas.
He was admitted to the United States
Supreme Court in 1860, entered political
life as a Whig and was an elector on

Declares That He Never Had Any
Personal Interest in the Ex
penditure of Government
Funds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. -Secretary
of War, Alger to-day appeared before
the War Investigating .Commission. .
â¢ Secretary Alger, in beginning, stated
that he had been on duty at the War
Department constantly during and "af
ter the war with Spain. The chiefs of
bureaus in the department, he said,
were generally, appointed to such places
because of seniority, but the President,
if he thought proper, could break this
rule. When asked in regard to expen
ditures by the department of the war
fund the j Secretary .replied that the
larger part had /been devoted to
strengthening coast defenses. In antici
pation of such an inquiry he had
brought with him memoranda, pre
pared by heads of bureaus, giving de
tails of the expenditures of this fund..
Secretary Alger further said that he
had never had any cause during the
war for complaint of any officers.
"Was the head of any bureau .guilty
of failure to discharge his duty dur
ing the continuance of the war?" asked
Governor Beaver.
"No, sir," replied Secretary Alger.
''Did any report come to you of any
irregularities or of any fraudulent prac
tices in the contracting for* supplies fur
nished to any department?"
â  ."No. sir." â :" '''.'"'â '':â _â  y "â â 
"Did you directly or indirectly have
any Interest in the selection of any of
the camps occupied by the troops?"
"No, sir. Ido not know that any one
connected with me had any such in
terest." *â  '-.â '. .' : â¢â  â¢
i "Did you have any interest in any
contract for materials supplied during
the war?" .-" ..- .-.. â¢ '
"Not a cent in any contract," replied
the Secretary,, emphatically. . '
- "Does that ; apply to transports pur
chased?" â¢ â â â 'â¢'.- . 'yy;yyy-yyy: :
" "Yes, sir." â â ..'â .
The Secretary went on to state that
he had never had any personal Interest
in ; the expenditure of. Government
funds, directly or ; indirectly. : No con
tracts for equipment were entered into
prior. to the declaration of war.
:: "Have you received any: complaint
from .the commanding general of ; the
army while at ; Porto Rico as to . the
quality .; of/, refrigerated and - canned
roast beef furnished the army?" : :
The , Secretary, replying,:.'- referred- 1 to
his | annual \\ report, quoting a dispatch
from General Miles asking that' no more
beef be | sent j because they could; get a
large supply ; there. General Miles had
public position was that of delegate to
the convention in his State, called to
consider her relation to the Union after
Lincoln's election. He voted for the
secession' ordinance and was elected a
member of the Confederate provisional
congress. Afterward, he served in the
more regularly organized Confederate
House of Representatives, and yet later
as a Confederate Senator, continuing in
the latter office until the end of the war.
In 1565 he was formally 'pardoned by
President Johnson, but was not per
mitted to resume practice in the United
States Supreme Court, because of the
"Iron-clad oath" bar, until he had
fought for and won that privilege by a
masterly legal struggle. In 1874 he be
came, acting Secretary of State ' of
Arkansas and later Governor of the
State. Subsequently he was twice sent
to the United, States Senate, and in 1885
President Cleveland appointed him At
torney General. He was a delegate to
the Chicago convention In 1892. when
he strove, for the nomination of his
former chief. Personally he was re
markably genial, and his popularity
was great.: â¢ - â _â - -.-. ='.- '-/â¢-,â '
said something about beef that had
spoiled there. ',â¢.'.,'' '.". ' ".
Governor Beaver asked whether actual
preparation -for;, war was not made be
fore the. declaration of war, because It
was thought it Would be averted. No
reply, however, was expected if the
question was not deemed by the Secre
tary a proper one.
The witness replied that there had
been hopes that war would be averted.
The chiefs of the several bureaus of the
department had never assembled to
bold a council of war. They were all
too busy. In regard to the Inspector
General's office, the Secretary did not
consider that the bureau had been
practically abolished by the transfer of
Officers to other duty.. He believed that
it retained its efficiency. :/:,;
. Secretary Alger next told of the In
spection of the camps, especially the
tour of inspection by General Miles.
He (Alger) had never received any of
ficial complaint from the armies in the
field in regard to fresh or canned meat
furnished the troops.
"Have you any information that meat
was chemically treated?"
"Nothing but what had been brought
out by this commission."
Beef, he went on, had been used as
an army ration for many, years and its
use was not an experiment in the Span
ish war. No complaints had been re
ceived by him from the camps In re
gard to beef.
'When asked whether he was person
ally interested in contracts for furnish
ing meat, the' Secretary said with pos
itiveness: "I have not: I never had,
directly or indirectly, interest in any
property or anything supplied to this
Government:." , 'â¢;â  :
He had never received an official re
port that beef furnished the army had
caused sickness. He > had received re
ports from .several sources that .at
Chickamauga and Gamp Thomas there
had been a lack of medicine and sup
plies. The reports were investigated
and supplies ordered at once. . He had
never received a feport from the sur
geon general that he was ; unable to fur
nish supplies. .â¢:â .'.''. ,
In regard to the arrival of the Fifth
Corps at Montauk, he said that every
possible precaution ; had â  been taken to
make the camp healthful and comfort
able. .There had been many deficien
cies that it was impossible to remedy,
but everything that could be done had
been done.
This closed the examination, and Sec
retary : Alger was asked whether he
wished to volunteer any statement, but
he declined to do so. : . .

POLICY OF THE
PRESIDENT UPHELD
BY GROSVENOR
Declares if Blood Is Shed in the
Philippines It Will Be Upon
the Heads of Opponents.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â third
day of the debate upon the bill for the
reorganization and increase of the reg
ular army passed without notable in
cident. Its ; feature was an hour's
speech by Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, whose
utterances, rightly or wrongly, are fre
quently supposed to reflect the views
of the President. ' Mr. Grosvenor de
clared most emphatically that the pres
ent situation in the Philippines was due
to the opposition in this country to the
ratification of the peace treaty. He an T
nounced : that the future of the islands
was a matter for Congress to decide
and that for the President to announce
a policy would be for him to usurp the
authority of Congress. The friends of
the bill continue to express great con
fidence in the passage of the bill, but
they admit that some important modifi
cations will be | made. The advocates
of a general staff detailed from the line
may be successful and the. size of the
infantry companies may be reduced.
Dinsmore (D.) of Arkansas opposed the
bill., A standing army might lead to
disaster, he said. In the course of his re
marks Dinsmore raised a laugh, at the
expense of Dolliver (R.) of lowa by re
calling a statement made by the latter
in a speech during the Fifty-first Con
gress In which he predicted the free coin
age" of silver before the close of Presi
dent Harrison's administration.
Dolliver called attention to the fact tbat
the speech was made In opposition to free
coinage.
Dinsmore warmly opposed the annexa
tion of the Philippines.
Grosvenor (R.; of Ohio followed Dins
more. In opposition Grosvenor said he
would approach with due solemnity the
measure fraught with such far-reaching
consequences. He should aim simply to
point out his own position, distinctly dis
claiming that he spoke for any one else.
He did not wonder that there was a wide,
distinct, antipodal difference upon the
question* said to be involved in the bill.
Those who Imagined it threatened an as
sault upon their liberties naturally op-'
posed it vigorously. Despite this alleged
horror at the' prospect of militarism,
but twice. in the history of the country
had the regular army been used save In
war. He recalled the action of President
Cleveland during the Chicago riots in
sending . troops there on the advice of
Secretary Olney, saying that that act
commended itself to him more -than any
other of the Cleveland administration.
The idea that the army might be invoked
to subvert our liberties was a man of
straw which gentlemen set up. It was a
slander upon the American people. He
characterized Johnson's speech yesterday
as the fiercest and most vindictive at
tack upon the administration that he had
heard on the floor* of the House. The
trouble was that the foundation, upon
which the whole magnificent superstruc
ture was built was false. The argument
he had made answered itself as soon as
the Intelligent mind recapitulated the
history of the past few months. Gros
venor contended that the purpose of the
administration had never deviated from
the time . the declaration of war was
adopted with the absurd provision in .it
which no one here would support now.
From that day .to. this, Oils Government
under the, guiding, hand of the adminis
tration had never deviated from Its pur
pose, and Mood to-day simply executing
the orders and decrees, of. Congress, civil
ization and of Almighty God.' 'â¢""'.' '
"Does the gentleman mean' the -Teller
provision; as the absurd- provision in the
declaration of war?" asked . Dinsmore.
"I mean the provision that the people of
Cuba were and of right ought to be free
and independent," replied Grosvenor.
Proceeding, Grosvenor declared that the
foundation of all our trouble originated
May 1. 1898. Incidentally at this point he
mentioned the desultory discussion in the
press. of Admiral Dewey as the Demo
cratic candidate for the Presidency in
1900. And yet, he said, it was Dewey who
had got the country into all this trouble.
At that time, he continued, there was not
a thought of the Philippines; there was
no one on this. floor who knew within a
thousand how many Islands were in the
archipelago. At that time, when we had
no thought of the Philippines, continued
Grosvenor, Dewey -was instructed to. And
the Spanish licet and destroy or- capture
It. The most brilliant page in our history
was' the, answer that splendid 'officer and
his men gave to those instructions. But
when he had executed his orders he
found himself powerless to get out of
Manila Bay. Was there, he asked, any
one who would undo Manila and tear
those shining pages from the history of
this' country? ** .
At this point Grosvenor paid an elo
quent tribute to our soldiers and sailors,
officers and men, and said that no one
should stain, with his consent, their honor
until proofs were produced, not of mis
takes, but of derelictions of duty. He
spoke feelingly of the President's difficult
task during the 120 days of the war, and
defied any one to show that he had failed
in any duty that he might have dis
charged. He described his -sleepless vigil
with. Adjutant General Corbln at his side,
and incidentally paid the latter an ex
alted tribute, .which was heartily greeted
by â members on the floor. No man ever
did his duty, he said, better than Henry
C. Corbln. After the protocol was signed,
Mr. Grosvenor said, the President had
sent to Paris a â¢ peace commission , which
fully and, grandly represented the best
type of American manhood. What had
that commission done which should' not
have been done? The President had been
criticized for not Informing Congress re
garding his ultimate - purpose regarding
the Philippines.' The President was not a
usurper; he had -.never sought and never
would seek to usurp the authorit y of Con
gress. The future of the islands was a
matter for Congress to decide. The blood
of those who might, be sacrificed In the
Philippines, he charged, would be upon
the heads of those. who opposed the Presi
dent's policy. -The President had nobly
discharged, his duty, when he found him
self by the accident of war in possession
of the PhllinDlnes. -*.Â»'"';
"If We were in- possession of the Philip
pines,", asked Terry (D.) of Arkansas,
"why should we pay Spain $20,000,000 for
them?"' : - â -â --â . â â -..:'â â¢ â¢ â  ,v
"Why, .let. me ask you," responded
Grosvenor', answering the. question by
asking another, "did we give Mexico $13,
--000,000 when she lay crushed under our
power?" . â¢ , . -v â¢
"Answer my question.'!. . '
"My question answers, yours."
Proceeding. Grosvenor charged that the
present strained relations "â  between the
American authorities and the' Insurgents
in the Philippines was due to the moral
support they were getting in this country.
He described "how. Aguinaldo had burned
the. proclamation of |he President of the
United States and had shot to death those
Who sought to print* it. -y â  â¢ '.â â¢â¢â :â â â¢.
"Aguinaldo was our. ally a few months
ago," interposed Johnson (R.) of Indiana.
"Why. did he not remain our ally?" re
plied Grosvenor. "
"Benedict Arnold was- our ally also, but
he became a traitor." -v
But for the: course of events here.'be
ginning before the conclusion. of the last
campaign, -.continued- . Grosvenor. ..there
would to-day be peace and co-operation
In the Philippines. The expressions : of
those who were opposing the administra
tion encouraged , the resistance of "Aguin
aldo and his gang" at. Iloilo," while here
In this capital Agoncillo was insultingly
demanding of the President that he de
fine his . position. ; He had seen . a letter
from Dewey, read In New York a few
days ago, In which- Dewey said that if
tho treaty was ratified and the insurgents
were taught that they were.not supported
by 2 a great party ;In the United States
there would bo an end of strife and peace
would â , be established: X . * .â¢ . â¦
In conclusion. Grosvenor challenged any
one to deny: First, that the President
had deviated. from the course mapped out
by Congress;, second, that he, had usurped
any authority he was not compelled- to
assume, and, , third, that the settlement
of .the Philippines .was a; question' for the
future...... -.:. -â¢â >...'.',â¢.,â¢:-â .--â â  â 
i, Hepburn 1 (R.) "of lowa .advocated , the
passage . of the bill.* He said .that- if the
army was increased to. 100,000 it would not
now be larger, the area,; population Â»â¢Â«Â«Â»
necessities of the United States consider
ed than the standing army which Thomas
Jefferson supported. He defended the
course of the President relative to ,- the
Philippines. He declared there was.' no
â justification for the reckless assertions
that the administration desired to hold
.the Philippines permanently. They would
be treated as Cuba was to be treated.
When the islands were pacified, when an
archy had been expelled, when the* in
habitants have had an opportunity to ex
press their wishes and form a government
then would be the time to sail away.'
Jett (D.) of Illinois, who is a member of
the Military Committee, attacked the bill
vigorously, but said he would vote for
the minority substitute. - Ho was unalter
ably opposed to the annexation. of \ the
Philippines. ..y : Vi
The other speakers at the afternoon ses
sion were MoÃae(D.) of Arkansas and
Simms (D.) of Tennessee in opposition to
the bill, and Brownwell (R.) of Ohio,

of New Jersey in support of it. <>
BUTLER TALKS FOR
THE EX-CONFEDERATES
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â the
Senate seemingly was about to .con
clude consideration of the pension ap
propriation bill,' late this afternoon
Butler (Pop.) of North Carolina offered
his amendment, announced some time
ago, providing for the pensioning of ex-
Confederate soldiers. Upon this he
took the floor and delivered a speech,
which, as he proceeded, developed into
a most unexpected utterance.
While his colleagues on both sides ;of
the chamber listened with interest.
Butler defended. the position taken by
the South during the great civil con
flict of a third of a century ago. He de
clared that the South was right and
that history would so record, and that
every stiot fired by a Southern, soldier
was fired in defense of the rights of his
State conferred by the constitution in
self-defense and in defense of his home
and fireside. -.
Bate (D.) of Tennessee, himself: a
distinguished Confederate officer,- de
clared that while the South believed it
was right, the occasion was not oppor
tune for the proposition which Mr. Br*t
ler had made, and that the Southern
soldiers as a body did not desire pen
sions from the General Government,
and he expressed his satisfaction that
Mr. Butler had withdrawn his amend
ment. _______________

Parr's Bar^ Receives BacK a
Greater Part of the Money
StoleQ.
LONDON, Jan. 26.â robbery of over Â£60,000 from Parr's Bank
in this city on Monday last, which has been the sensation of the
week, took a dramatic turn to-day when the chairman of the bank
announced at a meeting of the shareholders that Â£40,000 in the big
gest notes had been returned to the bank by post.
The robbery was apparently a most daring crime. The thief is
supposed to have walked boldly behind the counter, when there were
over 100 clerks at work, opened a drawer from which he took a par
cel of notes and walked out of the bank undetected. American
thieves are suspected of having been concerned in the theft, and it is
said several Americans were recently noticed loitering about the
premises. The police are again utterly helpless.
Thirty-six Â£1000 notes and twenty-two Â£500 notes figured in the
robbery. Most of these have now been returned and the remainder
of the notes are practically unnegotiable. i :"-
The chairman of the bank also announced that the Bank of Eng
land had promised to pay this amount, the Â£47,000, of which Â£40.000
had been returned. The remainder of the money was in notes of
smaller amounts, which could be easily passed, and might therefore
be considered lost. The shareholders greeted this unexpected an
nouncement with enthusiasm, especially as it was accompanied by a
declaration of a dividend of 19 per cent. ,
ARGUING THE
PEACE TREATY
Senators Fail to Get
Information.
SO M'KINLEY IS CRITICIZED
â 
*
ASSERTED THAT STATESMEN
ARE ENTITLED TO ALL FACTS.
Talk of Adopting a Resolution to
Prevent Treaty From Binding
Uncle Sam to a Colonial
Policy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
/
WASHINGTON, Jan. To-day's
executive session of the Senate was
consumed in discussion of the failure
of the President so far to send the Sen
ate the documents in his possession and
on rile in the State Department bearing
upon the Paris conference.
. Senator Gorman raised the point as
soon as the doors were closed that the
resolution had been adopted several
days since and addressed the Senate at
some length on the failure of the Presl-
dent to respond to the Senate's request
â¢for information.
The attack of the Maryland Senator
'.'was followed by similar speeches by
Senators Vest and Hoar and they were
replied to by Senators â¢ Lpooner and
Piatt. The five Senators engaged in a
running debate, the opponents for the
treaty contending that the Senate was
â¢entitled as a part of the treaty making
power to all the facts bearing upon the
case, and the supporters of the docu
ment holding that the President could
withhold any papers which he did not
'. consider in the interest of the general
welfare to give out. Senator Spooner
cited precedents to show that the Presi
dent could withhold information of this
character at his pleasure and that such
a course frequently had been followed
in cases in which the President deemed
! it unwise to communicate facts bearing
upon interested complications when to
.do so might prejudice the country's
best interests and promote the very
evils which it was sought to ameliorate.
The point was also made that the Presi
dent might feel more free to communi
cate with the Senate if he could be sure
of privacy in doing so. No one pro
. fessed to speak by authority and all the
.. Senators who were heard in support of
â¢ the President's course expressed con
' fidence that the President's - action,
whatever it might be, would be for the
best interests of the public.
Replying to this latter point. Sena
tor Hoar said that no one could excel
. him in admiration for the personal
qualities of the President or in confi
dence in his patriotism. At the same
time he contended for his original pro
position that the Senate was entitled
to the President's full confidence . in
passing upon a question of so much im
portance as the acquisition of territory
thousands of miles from our own
shores and with millions of people to
tally unlike our own population. He
â¢ thought there must be some reason for
â ..putting the Philippines on a footing so
, different from the footing on which
Cuba had been placed in the treaty.
The opinion is generally expressed
that the time allowed for the debate of
the treaty in executive session will not
be by any means consumed, as very
few Senators on either side desire to
m make speeches behind closed doors..
The friends of the treaty profess in
creasing confidence for ratification, but
there is some talk of adopting a nega
tive resolution to the effect that the
treaty does not bind the United States
to the adoption of a colonial policy.

HIS ACCUSER IS UNSEATED
WHITESIDE DISCREDITED BY
HIS OWN PARTISANS.
Is Denounced in Joint Session of
the Legislature as a Liar for
Making Accusations of
Bribery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HELENA, Mont., Jan. 26.â Sensations
came thick and fast to-day in the Mon-
tana Legislature. . Before the mem
bers met in joint session to vote for
United States Senator, the Grand Jury
reported that it had heard no evidence
on which to return any indictments.
For two weeks the Grand Jury had
been faithfully investigating the charge
of bribery made by ' State Senator
Whiteside of Flathead County, when
he dramatically turned over to a joint
committee thirty $1000 bills, swearing
they had been given him and three
others' by agents of W. A. Clark of
Butte to influence their votes in his
favor for the Federal Senate. White
side repeated his story to the Grand
Jury, and thirty-three other witnesses
were examined on all phases of the
matter. One of Whiteside's alleged co
partners in the vote-selling business re
pudiated him and discredited him be
fore the Grand Jury. Other contradic
tory and ref utatory evidence was given.
The result was a sweeping and com
plete vindication of Clark. Judge Mc-
Intire thanked the Grand Jury for their
action and said he would have come to
the same conclusion had he been on
the jury.
At the session of the Senate this af
ternoon by a vote of 14 to 9 Whiteside
was unseated on a contest for his of
fice and his Republican opponent given
the seat. Whiteside's majority on the
face of the returns was only one, and
a recount of the votes by the Senate
resulted in a reversal of the result.
Nine Democrats and five Republicans
voted to unseat him. All. those who
voted for Whiteside were Democrats.
In the joint session Whiteside made
a long speech, in which he made un
supported charges of bribery against
every man who voted for Clark. After
his speech was ended one of the ac
cused members arose in his place and
violently denounced Whiteside as a
liar, and there was a hot time for a
while, but no serious results. White
side reached in his hip pocket as if to
draw a gun, but the weapon was not
displayed. â

A New Jersey Woman Cut Off Her

to Be Most Effectual.
" NEW YORK, Jan. 26.â Mrs. Mary
Holly of Paterson, N. . J., always de
clared her greatest fault was that she
talked too much. . ' She felt that her
loquacity was a serious defect and de
cided to cut off the offending member.
Having carried oat her decision she is
now unable to talk at all, though she
was discharged as cured to-day from a
hospital in Paterson.
Family troubles had made the woman
despondent and one day about a month
ago she told some neighbors . the only
way she could think of to cure herself
of talking much was by cutting off
her tongue. They .found her in her home
several hours afterward unconscious
from loss of blood. She had cut off
an Inch and a half of her tongue with
a knife. It was at first thought she
would die, but careful treatment at the
hospital saved her life. Her abbreviated
tongue, however," refuses to perform its
office and she is unable to articulate a
single word Intelligibly.

Special Dispatch to ' The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 26.â damag
ing testimony given by Miss Matilda
Luetzone in the preliminary hearing
of Mrs. Augusta Young, to-day, on the
charge of arson, removed , all doubt of
her complicity in the . crime. = Harry
Young, her husband, who jumped his
bail and fled, has not been heard from
nor is there any present probability of
his capture. ' V ~V '.
Mrs. Young was brought before Jus
tice of the Peace Rodden this morn
ing. At the outset the . prosecution
sprung a surprise by offering a joint
complaint, charging both -Young and
his wife with the crime. By this they
were enabled , . to . offer - evidence of
Young's acts and declarations which
would otherwise have been inadmissi
ble. Associated with District Attorney
Mclsaac was 1 Frank Drury of Sau
Francisco. â  â¢â¢">'â¢ \
William : Lewis, '- an expressman at
Tiburon, was the first witness. He tes
tified to the discovery of the fire and
of his efforts to extinguish it. Fire was
discovered in. five rooms at the back of
the store, the Dally Supply. Kerosene,
gasoline and gunpowder were discov
ered in close proximity to the places
where the fire were started. Lewis'
testimony was corroborated by Fred
Hackett and Jerry O'Connell.
Constable Louis Hughes explained
the condition he found the store in the
next day when he visited the place for
the purpose of investigating. Gun
powder was scattered around and the
floors and walls were found to be sat
urated with kerosene.
Miss Matilda Luetzone in her testi
mony demonstrated not only that Mrs.
Young knew of the intended fire, but
was an actual participant. Miss Luet
zone is a cook employed in a neighbor
ing house. On the night of the fire her
attention was attracted to the Youngs
on account of their unusual actions- She
testified to having become so much in
terested in their proceedings that she
peeped through the windows. She saw-
Young and Mrs. Young arranging the
materials for the fire. Kindling wood,
cans of gasoline and powder were
placed around ln various parts of the
house. While Miss Luetzone's English
was somewhat imperfect, she told a
straight story, and two hours of the
most searching cross-examination by
Attorney Cochrane failed to shake it
in any material point. 2 k '"',,
At the close of Miss Luetzone's tes
timony the prosecution rested. Attor
ney Cochrane moved that the case be
dismissed as the commission of a crime
within the statute had not been shown.
Judge Rodden overruled the motion and
directed that Mrs. Young be held tto
answer, fixing her bonds at $2000. As
Mrs. Young prefers to remain in jail
no effort will be made to secure bonds.
UNCLE SAM MULCTED.
An English Justice Gives Judgment
in Favor of Pelley Brothers.
LONDON, Jan. 26.â Justice Bigham.
in the Queen's Bench Division of the
High Court of Justice, to-day decide
in favor of Pelley Bros., the ship
brokers, in the suit of the United States
against them to recover Â£5300 paid the
brokers on April 21, 1898, on two 600
--ton colliers by Lieutenant Sims, who
was then acting naval attache of the
United States Embassy in London,
that amount being 10 per cent of the
, total sum, Â£53,000, for which the ship
brokers agreed, on ..prll 21, to deliver
the colliers. 'â¢-â ;'
It was claimed -on behalf of the
United. States that Pelley Bros., ac
cording to the contract, were to deliver
the colliers "as soon as possible." and
that they promised verbally that one
of them was to be ready to sail in
twenty-four hours and the other in
forty-eight hours, but that they failed
to deliver the ships before the neu
trality proclamation of A ril 26. claim
ing they were unable to get them ready
in time to do so. The case hinged on
whether a state of war existed on April
22, when the owners ceased their prep
arations to fit out the ships. They testi
fied that they sounded the Foreign Of
fice on the subject, and were informed
that they might be liable under the
foreign enlistment act if they carried
out their contract. The Justice said
they did what he hoped any English
gentleman would do under the circum
stances. He himself believed that war
existed on April 21 and that there was
no ground to Insinuate that the brokers
acted in bad faith. They were entitled
to keep the money under a clause in the
contract which provided that it should
be retained if a state of war preceded
the delivering of the ships. *

ablest soldier, and. is recognized by the people as the champion of their
rights. He has unmade two presidents that attempted to override the popu
lar rightsâ Moreno, in 1876, and Cordero, in 1895. That Alfaro has been suc

the rebel forces at San Aucanna Monday.

SACRAMENTO", Jan. 26.â The case of
Jacob Oppenheimer, charged with the
murder of a fellow-convict at Folsom
Prison named Charles Ross, is still on
trial in Judge Johnson's department of
the Superior Court. There was some
thing of a sensation in the course of the
trial to-day when Brady," the Yolo train
robber, attired in prison stripes, made
his appearance as a witness. He added
to the sensation when he declared that
Ross tried to stab -Oppenheimer with a
knife that he held in his hand before
he himself received a fatal thrust from
Oppenheimer's % sharpened '.file. 1 The
knife fell to the 'ground, said Brady,
and then he (Brady) seized it and threw
it away. He asserted that he still knew
where the knife was secreted.
. Attorney, Brown, for the- defense, in
sisted that Brady be sent back to the
prison, under proper escort, for the
purpose of securing this knife as evi
dence. After some argument the court
granted the motion and late this after
noon Brady was taken to Folsom un

Admiral Sampson above Admiral Schley.

Department have looked into the ques
tion of Schley's status as raised in the

vice, in accordance with the precedent es
tablished in the Quackenbush case. But
as Quackenbush was dropped as the re

PACIFIC COAST INTERESTS.
Log Bafts and Cable Bills Being
Closely Looked After.
From letters recently received by Sec
retary Scott of the Chamber of Com
merce it Is evident that the Pacific Coast
Representatives at Washington are look
ing closely after the interests of this lo
cality, as per requests in resolutions sent
to the East a few days ago. At the an
nual meeting of the chamber a memorial
was. prepared asking that when the Pa
cific cable bill came up for action
everything possible be done to have in
serted a clause that the material be fur
nished by this country. A bill was also
forwarded prohibiting the construction
and rafting of logs from ports along the
coast to this city on account of tha dan*
ger to shipping. 'JIM 111 ill.i l.|iJl|i_ilinHf"np
Yesterday letters were received from
Congressman E. F. Loud and Senator
George C. Perkins relative to these mat
ters. Of the.cable Senator Perkins writes:
"When the cable bill gets to the amend
ment point an amendment will be offered
providing for the construction of the ca
ble in this country." . , ,
On the same subject Mr. Loud writes:
"Relative to the Hawaiian cable- 1 will
say that it would seem from the action of
the House recently that that subject will
not receive consideration again. this Con
gress."
Upon the subject of towing log rafts
Mr. Loud says:
*'In relation to the bill proposed on the
subject of towing logs on the Pacific will
say I will introduce it Into the House,
although 1 question whether the same
can receive favorable consideration as
there is only a little over a month of this
session of Congress remaining. I will do,
however, what lies in my power.''

A Lunatic Noisily Appeals to thÂ«
French Hospital for Shelter.
The inmates of the French Hospital
were disturbed a few nights ago by the
entrance into their grounds of a raving 1
maniac, who had not only. been stripped
of. his mentality but of his clothes a_
well, and for a brief period wildest con
fusion reigned.
. It is the custom . of the Institution to
bolt and bar its gates at nightfall. On
this particular night, however, one of
the physicians, on retiring, neglected this
precaution. As he ascended the front
steps of the building his attention was
attracted by a frenzied shriek, and turn
ing he saw a man stark naked, screaming
and flinging his arms wildly about his
head, dart through the hospital gate and
run round and round the house.
The man was hnally captured by one of
the attendants, to whom he confidently
asserted that he was Napoleon Bonaparte.
He added that six men were pursuing
him In order to assassinate him, and that
he had fled for refuge to the hospital,
knowing â¦hat a French institution would
feel honored In affording shelter and pro
tection to Napoleon Bonaparte.
He was carried to one of the wards and
put to bed: but became so violent that it
took six men to hold him. Finally be
coming wholly unmanageable, he was
wrapped in blankets, put Into an ambu
lance and conveyed to the Receiving Hos

VICTIMS OF DIME NOVELS.
Small Boys Endeavor to Emulate the
-**â¢ Example of Sontag and Evans.
ALAMEDA, Jan. Morris Weiss,
Harold Perry, Arthur Gott and Amiel Di
dies. boys ranging in age from 14 to. 18,
were caught to-day in an attempt to emu
late the example of Sontag and Evans.
The boys had been feasting on dime-novel
literature, and had concluded that a ban
dit's life was the ideal existence. For
weeks they have been busily engaged
constructing two caves in a vacant lot
near the lower end of Park street. They
worked entirely by night, carrying the
dirt away in sacks. They concealed the
entrance to the caves so completely that
no one besides the boys had the least
suspicion of the existence Jof the . ren
dezvous. -..-'â  â¢..
The boys might have been able to carry
out their original intention of becoming
bandits had they not started in to secure
booty that no well regulated band of
brigands would have dreamed of. . They
attempted to get away with a two-story
dwelling house, the residence of the late
F. K. Krauth Sr. They were carrying
off the building in sections and recon
structing it in . their underground hiding
place.
Tolerable headway was being made on
the undertaking, when a policeman sur
prised them at work. One of - the
boys was captured, but the other three
made their escape and were not taken
into custody until this evening.
Everything movable about the Krauth
house had been taken and stored in the
caves, a-d he Toys say it was their in
tenlio itcg!' away with the whole build
ing. They calculated it would take them
a year to complete the job.
Charges of malicious mischief have
been placed against .them.
There Was No Wrong.
OAKLAND, Jan. 26.â The inquest on the
body of the six-weeks-old child, Maude
Porter, was concluded to-night and Coro
ner Mehrmann refused to approve of the
verdict. The jury heard the testimony
of all the officers of the Rescue Home,
where -the child died, and brought in a
verdict, that death was due to extreme
carelessness on the part of the mother
and of the officers of the home. ''me
censure of the officers of , the home is not
deserved." said the Coroner. "They were
very, straightforward witnesses and there
was nothing in the evidence to justify
any such ; verdict, and I have certified
to my disapproval of it. The mother is
a young girl, not very strong minded, and
she covered her child's face with a very
light downy quilt. The least motion of
the child would bind the quilt over its
mouth, and , this was the cause. The
baby also had a weak heart, and conse
quently was easily . asphyxiated. There
is nothing to show the least criminality
on the part of the mother or of careless
ness on the part of the officers." '_>Â-â

A PROPHECY FULFILLED.
WHEN in 1873 the Hon. William Alvord
retired from the office of Mayor of the city he
devoted a notable part of his closing address
to the Board of Supervisors to a statement concern
ing the City Hall, then in process of construction, and
in doing so made certain declarations which to-day
read like a prophecy that has been fulfilled.
After noting the progress made in the work on the
City Hall during that year Mr. Alvord said: "I feel
impelled to add that it will be a lasting disgrace to the
city to erect so large and splendid a pile in the small
tract reserved for it, hemmed in by the rows of inferior
houses that will eventually grow up around it. The
sale of the lots fronting the hall on Market street was
a mistake that should, if possible, be corrected by re
purchasing them before any improvements are made
thereon. The whole space between the hall and Mar
ket street should belong to the city and be converted
into lawns and gardens, thus making a beautiful es
planade in front of the costly edifice now being
erected
"In the great cities of Europe power and money
have been employed in our time to remove unsightly
obstructions and clear the way for fine views of
cathedrals and other architectural monuments. It is
an inexcusable defiance of experience and taste for
this young city to build up obstructions and to hide
its most pretentious public hall as if ashamed of it.
The policy of the city in this, as in all other particu
lars, should look to the future â be calculated
to increase the beauty and spaciousness of a metropo
lis destined to be the second in America."
The warning of that statement has been fulfilled.
The rows of inferior buildings hiding the view of the
City Hall from Market street have been constructed.
The disgrace to the city has been accomplished. It
now remains to be seen whether we will be content
to live in that disgrace or to remedy it. There never
will be a time when the desired lots can be repur
chased more cheaply than now. This, therefore, is
the time to act. The City Hall park is needed and
should be provided without delay. No other muni
cipal improvement is more important or more pressr
ing than this.
c SUIT TO RECOVER.
AS an outcome of the exposures made by The
Call of the frauds by which the Pacific Bank
was wrecked, a suit has been brought in the
Superior Court of Los Angeles County to recover
from Moses H. Sherman a large sum of money
alleged to belong of right to the bank and its de
positors.
As set forth in the report from Los Angeles, the
complaint of the plaintiff asks for an accounting of
25,500 shares of stock in the Los Angeles Consoli
dated Railway, and alleges that in 1889 the bank and
Sherman were equal owners of the stock in question,
which was of a par value of $2,550,000, and constituted
51 per cent of the capital stock of the corporation.
The complaint continues that in November, 1892,
Sherman represented that the road was in financial
distress and he was authorized to borrow $150,000 arid
to place the 25,500 shares of stock as security for the
loan. y.2y2yy:,
The bank now alleges that this transaction was not
undertaken by Sherman in good faith, but in order
to gain personal control of the stock, which was in
1894 exchanged by Sherman for other stock and
bonds worth $500,000. The bank now claims half of
this sum on the ground that Sherman holds it as trus
tee. Representatives of the bank regard this sum as
the proceeds of the half interest of the original block
of stock. Judgment for $275,000 is asked for.
Since the case is now in the courts for determina
tion, The Call has no desire to comment further upon
the evidence which was brought out in the startling
disclosures made of the wrecking of the bank. These
revelations were made by The Call, however, mainly for
the purpose of bringing to light facts upon which just
such suits as the one instituted could be safely based.
It was the desire of The Call that the depositors
should be able to recover something from the wreck
of their fortunes by the spoliators of the bank, and the
action undertaken in the Los Angeles court promises
to aid the fulfillment of that desire. r -
Judge Trcadwcll seems to have about the correct
idea as to the nickel-in-thc-slot device which does so
much gorging and so little in the way of dividends to
the investor. ", y-r

A LOAFER GOVERNMENT.
' \T OTHING is more suggestive than the low
: i [^ dudgeon of the Examiner at the suggestion of
i Irving M. Scott for the Senatorship.
: The Examiner is appalled and views with alarm
in advance the possibility of a great ship-builder hav
ing a seat in Congress, because, that body legislates
in matters affecting his business and provides for con
i tracts on which his firm may bid.
This is a bald proposition to exclude from Congress
everybody who has any near or remote interest in the
processes of government. Every statute is liable to
go before a court for construction, and out
I of the incident litigation a lawyer gets a fee.
Therefore, lawyers in practice must be excluded
from Congress. Manufacturers are directly in
: terested in revenue legislation, and are, there
fore, ineligible. Merchants have a stake in the
same legislation, and are outlawed by the Examiner
theory. Physicians have a remote interest in legisla
tion affecting their profession and must not sit in
Congress. If ship-builders must stay out, so must
ship-owners, and a farmer is ineligible because he is
I concerned also in revenue legislation. Since the in-
I terstate commerce law was declared constitutional no
j one interested in transportation can legislate. A news
j paper owner cannot go to Congress because the Gov
| ernment contracts for advertising in the press.
It will be seen, therefore, that the new rule of the
j Examiner excludes everybody except loafers who are
j not manufacturing anything, nor producing, nor buy-
I ing or selling. It turns government over to the idle,
j v. ho have no stake in the property, business or indus
j tries of the country.
For a long time the Examiner labored to prove
: that Mr. Scott could not build a seaworthy ship. It
! smuggled reporters on warships built in his yards, to
; come back from trial trips and write them up as death
traps that would fall into a heap of jackstraws in a
middle wind or rip apart from the jar of firing one of
! their own guns. This defamation of his work went to
every ship-builder in Europe, to hamper Mr. Scott in
his business and give his rivals an advantage. This
was to his injury and to the harm of San Francisco.
If it had been true Mr. Scott might have become
eligible to the Senatorship under the Examiner rule,
for he could not have been awarded any more Gov
ernment contracts. When the Oregon steamed 16,000
miles and appeared in the Atlantic as fresh as a jolly
boat, ready for a fight, without heating a journal,
starting a seam or missing a turn of her screw, the
lying of the Examiner about Scott's skill was filed
away in the same pigeonhole with the assessment of
the estate of the late Mr. Ananias. '- 1 '.;-.
Being no longer able to misrepresent his ability as
a ship-builder, the Examiner proposes now that Cali
fornia shall declare Irving M. Scott ineligible to the
Senate because he has built the best ship that floats
and because he is a man of culture, position and
honor, a credit to his State and country.
The Call is not making Mr. Scott's fight, nor any
body's fight, for the Senate. We simply want what the
Examiner does not want, a creditable representative
of California to be elected. The Examiner is doing
its best to get a discreditable representative chosen.
California Republicans will do well to avoid adopting
the Examiner's theory that no man doing business or
practicing a profession in the United States is eligible
to the Senatorship, for it means a government of
loafers, or of men who are doing business outside
this country mining in Mexico, for instance.
THE PURE WINE BILL.
WHETHER the . bill of Senator La Rue, de
signed for the prevention of wine adulteration,
is wisely ordered in all its details is a matter
which can be determined only by experts, and per
haps not even by them until it has been tested in
operation. The subject is a complex one, and only
the results of experience can show whether in its pro
visions the measure falls short of its object in any
respect or overreaches the mark.
The enactment of some such measure, however, is
not only desirable but necessary for the protection of
the interests of honest dealers and producers in one
of the greatest industries of the State. It is another
step in the direction of a comprehensive system of
legislation against the various forms of adulterated
or sophisticated foods, luxuries and medicines which
have now become so common throughout the
civilized world as to be a serious menace not only
to legitimate business, but to life itself.
A short time ago The Call directed attention to th
seizure and condemnation by the Mexican authori
ties of a large quantity of Californian wine shipped to
that country for sale. The condemnation was based
upon the charge that the wine was adulterated with
salicylic acid, and the merchants in whose hands it
was seized, after making tests of their own, conceded
that the charge was well founded. The result of the
case was that the repute of our wines was injured in
the Mexican market, and honest dealers in pure wines
suffered because of the action of the dishonest dealer.
Senator La Rue's bill, after declaring in detail what
shall constitute pure wines and the processes by which
they may be fermented and clarified, provides that
every manufacturer, or dealer in wines as defined
: shall mark on every cask, package or bottle, in plain
letters, the name of the firm; further, that any wine
which upon analysis shows the presence of any in
gredient deleterious to the health of the consumer
shall be subject to seizure and confiscation; and,
finally, the violation of the law is declared a misde
meanor, for which an adequate penalty is imposed.
' It would be a benefit to honest producers and deal
ers if the law requiring the labeling of packages with
the name of the manufacturer were enacted by Con
gress and made applicable to all classes of goods.
One of the heavy handicaps upon the industries of
California is the frequency with which inferior fruit
and wine products put up in the East are branded
with California labels and put upon the market as the
products of this State. The evil, moreover, is an in
creasing one, and constitutes one of the strongest ar
guments for the adoption of a comprehensive pure
food law for the country at large.
SENATORS ATHIRST FOR GORE.
SENATOR DICKINSON has introduced a bill
defining conditions under which the taking of
human life may be lawful. f ; -fv' -
The real purpose is shown in the last clause. We
quote it as a choice specimen of locoed statesman
ship: Homicide shall be justifiable * * * "when
committed in the heat of passion (aroused) by the
willful and malicious publication of libelous matter
of and concerning the slayer by the party slain."
The bill is hardly necessary. There have been so
many precedents as to have clearly established - the
bounds. Nobody is denied the right of self-defense,
or the defense of honor, whether that of himself or of

guilt had been absolutely settled. Yet in the list of
circumstances he submits as bases for the innocent
shedding of blood there is none explaining how with
out fault one may lure a girl into a lonely church and
there strangle her. We respectfully suggest that the
omission be corrected.
Several Senators have been touched on raw spots.
Some of them have been , accused of wrongdoing. . A
few have had their pictures published in a style of art
not designed to flatter, but rather to mildly correct
and uplift, to make plain the error of the Senatorial
way. Dickinson would give to rich of these the privi
lege of going forth and slaughtering editors and car
toonists on the highway. It is too much to ask. The
thought that a Senator reading his morning paper
may rush to the reporters' stand and there establish
an abattoir, thereafter resuming his seat, wiping his
dripping blade or reloading his pistol, while the
wheels of legislation begin to move again and the
sergeant-at-arms mops up the gore, is not a pleasing
one. A far better way is for the Senator to so de
mean himself as to be above hostile criticism, and an
excellent start in this direction would be in refraining
from the introduction of fool bills.
AN EXCELLENT BILL.
IF Assemblyman Atherton of Marin County will
force his bill for the suppression of poolrooms
upon the Legislature with sufficient energy to, se
cure its passage he will earn the gratitude of large
numbers of people, who will keep his memory green
notwithstanding the efforts of the caricaturists to
thrust fame upon him. We believe that it is only
necessary to get this subject before the Legislature to
procure the enactment of a law, for unless the mem
bers are lost to all sense of their duty to the public
they could not fail to vote right.
The sale of pools upon horse races ought to be
suppressed everywhere. The business demoralizes all
who engage in it; it corrupts the young and debases
the aged. It is illegitimate in every sense of the
word and can be defended on only one ground,
which is that it perhaps aids to encourage the breed
ing and development of fine horses. But even this
argument fails when urged in support of general pool
rooms. As carried on in California this part of the
.business is entirely indefensible.
Mr. Atherton's bill proposes to prohibit the sale of
pools in all places outside of racetracks, his object
being to break up the dens located in his own county.
This is a compromise on a general prohibitory law
which ought to be accepted by the Legislature.
Among the people of San Francisco, where the evils
of miscellaneous pool-selling are ever present, we ven
ture to say not a dissentient will be found to the
measure. Certainly the frequent fates of the messen
ger boys, clerks and bookkeepers who are led to
gamble upon horse races by the presence of these
places upon the public streets is a daily object lesson
which needs no amplification.
Heretofore it has been found difficult to convict
outside pool-sellers owing to the disposition .. of
Judges and juries to be lenient and to respond to the
"pulls" of the politicians interested in the dens.
Under a State law, however, there is every reason to
believe that the result would be different. Mr.
Atherton's bill not only makes it a misdemeanor to
sell pools outside of racetracks, but the same penalty
is directed at the owners of buildings in which the
business is carried on. The Police Courts of this city
would find it difficult to evade the provisions of such
a statute, unless it were full of holes, which is ap
parently not the case with the bill under discussion.
Mr. Atherton should see that his bill is not smothered
in committee which is the usual. method adopted by
the pool-sellers for defeating legislation of this char
acter â but brought before the Senate and Assembly
for action. Once up for consideration, its-passage
ought to be easy.
CECIL RHODES IN HIS GLORY.
REPORTS from London concerning the recep
tion given Cecil Rhodes on his recent arrival
there show that the once discredited backer of
the Transvaal raid has now regained all his former
prestige and even augmented it. In some respects his
welcome has been even greater than that accorded
Lord Kitchener, and he now seems to be regarded as
the foremost man in the empire.
It is not strange that this should be so. Kitchener
represents victory and the military glory of Great
Britain, and was of course received with all the en
thusiasm that such heroes excite among the masses.
Rhodes represents industrial conquest, the extension
of trade, the building of railroads, the opening of new
lands to civilization and the creation of new oppor
tunities for labor and capital to acquire wealth. In
fact, what Kitchener accomplished has simply opened
a way for the undertaking of the great schemes which
Cecil Rhodes proposes to carry out.
. All that Kitchener could do in London was to ask
the financial magnates to subscribe money to build
a school at Omdurman. Rhodes asks them to take
stock in an enterprise that will return them big profits
arid firmly bind to the empire nearly the whole of
Africa. He visits Great Britain to take advantage of
the situation caused by Kitchener's victory, for the
purpose of advancing his long cherished ambition of
constructing a railroad from Cape Colony to Cairo.
The project which a few years ago seemed like a
dream of a visionary rather- than the plan of a con
structive statesman is now feasible. Rhodes' railways
already extend from Capetown northward as far as
Buluwayo. He now desires funds to push the line
from that point to Khartoum, where it will meet the
military railway that Kitchener constructed as an ex
tension of the Egyptian system. If the, gap can be
completed there will be a British railroad from the
Cape to Cairo, and Rhodes will take his place as one
of the greatest empire builders in the history of the
world. 'â  .'.â¢'. -'â¢''';
Without the work of Rhodes the victory of
Kitchener would profit Great Britain very little. With
the supplement of that work, however, it will prob
ably prove to be the event which. determined the vir
tual sovereignty of Africa, for with such a road in her
possession Britain would soon dominate the conti
nent and bring all the tribes of the interior into vas
salage. ,',,â '" ;y:.l*
.The enterprise, however, is not going to be one of
easy performance. The gap to be filled from Bulu
wayo to Khartoum is something like 3000 miles, and
the whole region is wild and inhabited by the fiercest
savages now in existence. Rhodes is said to have
estimated the cost of the work at $50,000,000. Labor
of course is cheap and abundant. The. British Gov
ernment is expected to subscribe liberally or to guar
antee the stock. It is to obtain that assistance that
Rhodes .is now in London, and from the reports it
appears he will succeed.
Merrill of San Francisco, who introduced into the
Assembly the bill providing for the imprisonment of
debtors, is the gentleman at whose request Dan
Burns. paid for two railroad tickets across the con
tinent, but who refuses to vote for the Mexican.
Possibly Burns thinks that Merrill is a little slow in
paying debts himself, however anxious he may be on
behalf of the worthy butcher and baker. ' * '. [: .*
SKYSCRAPER
ON THE SITE OF
THE RICHELIEU
Newman Wins the
Leasehold Suit.
MAY SELL FOR A LARGE PRICE
PROPOSAL TO ERECT A LIFE
INSURANCE BUILDING.
If the Scheme Does Not Miscarry the
Structure Will Cover One of
â¢ i the Blythe Estate ,- ;
; Lots.
Another skyscraper, to look down on the
Lotta Fountain, Is one of the probabili
ties of the near future. The location is
the site of thÂ© old Adams & Kibbe build
ing, on .the gore of Geary and Market
streets, more familiarly known as the
Richelieu saloon, of which Charles New
man is proprietor.
It was announced in The '"'all several
weeks ago that the improvement of the
corner was contemplated and that the
building would- become the home of one
of the leading insurance companies of the
East, supposed to be the New York Life.
The publication of this news led to a law
suit between Newman and George Carroll
of Carroll & Carroll, wholesale liquor
dealers, to decide who owned the lease.
Incidentally.' the lease, which runs about
five years, was worth fighting for, as the
company that desired to build on the lot
offered $40,000 and other considerations in
order to make it possible to carry out
their plans. : y 4 .
George Carroll thought he had a good
chance to get at least a share of that fat
plum, but the court found that he had no
equity in the matter and decided in New
man's favor. This decision removes the
main obstacle to the enterprise, and it Is
expected that it will soon begin to take
definite shape. Lucky Newman appears
to cut a very important figure in the
proposition. His leasehold on the Riche
lieu property, on account of its term and
for business reasons, is exceptionally
valuable. This is made plain by the fact
that he is to receive $40,000 for the transfer
thereof. Another part of the agreement
that will be of particular interest to that
portion of the community that goes "up
and down the line" is the fact that the
old Richelieu is to give place to a "gen
tlemen's cafe," which it is said will be un
surpassed by anything of the kind on the
continent. This will occupy the Richelieu
quarters, with an extension of fifteen feet
up Market and Geary streets.
It is stated that the insurance corpora
tion will secure the adjoining lot, now a
part of the old Blytho estate, upon which
to build. This will give a fairly good
frontage. on both streets and allow of the
erection of a modern architectural slice
of cheese among the other striking tall
structures of the city. The principal con
dition of the deal Is that the building
must be completed,, within eighteen
months of the time of the transfer of the
leasehold, and that Newman is to have a
ten years lease of the cafe portion. Fail
ing to complete the building within the
specified time the corporation Is bound to
pay a substantial forfeit for each month
.over. time. ~ ;â .>.?:-â â¢;â¢'." ',-v... â

founders of ' the place It went into the
hands of John Farley, backed by Carroll
& Carroll, who gave it its present name.
The venture was not a success, and the
place rapidly passed through the hands

GRAND JURY REPORTS
ON THE BRANCH JAIL
BROADWAY INSTITUTION IN
UNSANITARY CONDITION.
After Due Consideration of Many
Cases the Inquisitorial Body
Finds an Indictment.
The Grand Jury held a protracted ses
sion yesterday. Many witnesses were ex
amined, on several cases, resulting in the
finding of one indictment. This was
gainst J. P. Turner, who has been the
central figure in a number of criminal
suits in recent years. Late in the after
noon the jury filed Into Judge Carroll
Cook's court and presented the indict
ment. It was placed on the secret file. A
bench warrant was Issued â for Turner,
his bail being fixed at $2500.
Ex-Deputy Superintendent of Schools
Charles B. Stone, who has been retained
by the inquisitorial body as an expert,
was in attendance upon the Jury, but was
not called to testify. He supplied the
members with some data' which they dis
cussed. If the courts decide that the one
twelfth act is constitutional it is possi
ble the jury will proceed against the
bondsmen of the last School Directors.
They will be liable for the large amount
of money spent and bills contracted In ex
cess of the amount allowed by law.
The major portion of the afternoon was
taken up in a discussion of the condition
of the jail on Broadway. One hundred
and ninety-five prisoners are confined
there, some cells . containing eight men.
Owing to defective plumbing the
place is in an unsanitary condition and a
menace to the health of all who enter It.
The jury determined to send a commu
nication to the Building Committee of
the Board, of Supervisors, asking them to
present the matter, to their associates for
their consideration.
Poverty Stays a Youthful Union.
Two youthful country maidens one,
Laura . Walker, aged 13 years, and the

Fell to become the bride of Call Sodbe,
who .is -2 employed on the United States
training ship Adams at Mare Island. She
said that the young man hod written her
to come to the city, where he would meet
her, and all would go well. When she ar

they took lodgings at a house 1? Fifth

DULLEST SYMPHONY
OF THE SEASON.
THE symphony concert in the Orphe
um yesterday afternoon was re
markable for nothing, except per
haps A. Weiss' handling of the cello
solo in the serenade for string or
chestra by Volkmann. I arrived too
late for the "Midsummer Night's
Dream," and was, together with a hun
dred belated others, locked out on the
sidewalk during the performance of that
number. I hope that it was well played,
but at the same time I will wager that it
was not. Never before in San Francisco
did Mr. Scheel direct a concert as unin
teresting as this one was. The symphony,
for some unexplained reason, was Gold
mark's "Rustic Wedding," a lively and
unique piece of music, but certainly not
one that deserves three performances by
the same band in little more than a sea
son, while so many Important works are
not being heard even once. It was played
without Scheel's usual delicacy and ab
solutely without enthusiasm; it was, in
fact, the dullest symphony performance
of the year. The closing piece was Sven
selen's "Carnival a Paris." a freakish
firecracker that would sound as silly - by
any other nameâ say, "Carnival of Pare
sis." STEVENS.

Confusion reigns supreme in the De

â¢. cation adopted on Wednesday night have

out their general scheme of retrenchment
and reform the School Directors, in most
instances, have lost sight of individuals
and do not know who are affected by the
resolutions of consolidation and dismissal.
Some of the teachers that have been con
solidated or dismissed as substitutes, pro
bationary and special teachers know their
fate as a matter of course. Many others
that have been consolidated out of schools
and some that have not been do not know
until the Superintendent of Schools fin
ishes his compilations and submits his
. final report. It is expected that this re
â¢ port will be submitted next Monday night
at an adjourned meeting of the School
Board.
Until then confusion and uncertainty
. must continue. An example will illus

remembered that the Board of Education
established that fifty pupils should be a
minimum basis of attendance for each
day class. Principals of schools were In
structed to classify their schools upon
':' this basis, and to classify in every in

executive session of the board there was
an animated discussion over the matter. j
Some of the Directors could not sec why

â¢' sharp discussion followed and the affair
was taken under consideration until the

Of the protests that have arisen the one j
against the closing of the City Normal
â¢ School was the strongest and the longest. I
The 125 girl petitioners evidently found j
an able champion in Director Gedge, the
youngest member of the board. Five '
months of the year remain to be studied j
out by the class and the plea found a fa
vorable hearer in another member. This
gradually Increased until seven votes
stood for permitting the school to remain ,
open for the balance of the year, end
' Ing June 30, provided the pupils paid its '
running expenses. To the board this
seemed to be receding from the original j
stand that the Institution be abolished,
. but the cause of the girls won over Di- |
rectors Armstrong, Bergerot, Conlon.
'Cole, Gedge, Head and Kempâ a partial
victoryâ the school was given five
' months' grace.
-â¢ The salary bill of the school which Its â 
125 girl patrons have taken upon them
' -selves, according to the old pay schedule, I
â¢ is about $380 per monthâ Miss Fowler,
principal, $200; Miss Fitzgerald. $140, and j
. janitress, $40; total for the five months, ,
â¢{I9OO. Judge Conrey of the Taxpayers*
. Educational League, who has charge of |
f
-
this unique financial matter, states that
the money in monthly payments Is ready
for use and the school will go on till
June 30, till the present and last class is
graduated.
Miss Fowler and her pupils were jubi
lant yesterday morning over the conces
sion. The newspaper visitor found the
gray haired teacher sitting in her recep
tion room, sewing a slight rent In the
national ensign, a sort of colonial dame
maklng-the-first-flag tableau, and a con
gratulatory group of girls around her.
"We did Aulte well in the terrible or
deal." said she, "and came out with colors
partly flying. The pupils are satisfied
and the studies will go on as usual. Of
course, it will come a little harder on
them, especially on those who are less
able than others to pay for their tui
tion, but there will be no complaining.
Every student here must earn ncr own
living, and to gain the profession of
teaching she entered this Normal School.
It Is said this institution is below stand
ard, and that It has only one year of
study, while State Normals have four.
Let me explain that: Pupils here are
high school graduates, while those in the
State schools need not be such. Another
published error was that Alameda Coun
ty refused our diplomas. The School Su
perintendent of that county has made a
different statement. However, we are
thankful for the grace we have re
ceived."
Miss Fowler's position is a peculiar one.
! According to the order of the Board of
! Education, she goes off the payrolls on
I January 31. She will be employed by the
normal students for five months ending
â  June 30, and then where she will be "at"
must be determined, possibly, by the
court, as she is not disposed to be abol
ished with her school. Miss Fowler was
somewhat startled by the visitor's query
as to whether her acceptation of the pu
. pils' offer for five months' employment
I could be technically construed as a vir
| tual surrender of her position and con-
I tinuous salary in the School Department
I should she finally fail of a place on the
| "safe" list by reason of long service as a
i public teacher.
The pioneer mandamus suit of the num
j ber that will probably follow the board's
I order of Wednesday evening will be that
; of Miss Mollie L. Sabins, a Washington
| Evening School teacher. Recently, an
ticipating the loss of her position, she
applied for a restraining order, which was
refused by Judge Belcher of the Superior
Court, on the ground that there was then
no evidence that she had been dismissed.
The Judge in his decision referred to a
i previous caseâ that of Bell against the
, Board of Educationâ in which he decided
a mandamus-suit in favor of a dismissed
i teacher. Attorney J. H. Splnettl stated
i yesterday that if Miss Sabins were dis
i missed from her position and salary she
; would immediately commence suit against
j the board. '
"I have every reason to believe," said
: he, '"that Miss Sabins and Miss Dwyer
have been consolidated out of the Wash
ington Evening School. The former has
been In the department fourteen months,
and her class was the largest in that
school. All of the decisions of the Supe
rior and Supreme courts have been fa
vorable to the teachers, and all of the
decisions follow the Kate Kennedy case.
Miss Sabins violated none of the rules of
the department, her competency was not
questioned, her class and school are still
In existence, and I cannot see why the
courts will not Intervene in her behalf.
The Board of Education is actuated by a
worthy desire to economize and work the
department out of a grievous tangle, but
it must not treat a regularly elected
teacher with Injustice."
The compiling of the lists of the dis
missed ana unassigned is a work, under
the rules of the Board of Education, re
quiring care and time: Teachers who en
tered the department previous to August
1, 1898, are out beyond the hope of sal
vation unless the courts come to their re
lief.
This will cull out about eighty-five
! names. From August 1 the list will be
| followed back to about the middle of the
| year, the last elected teacher going first
; till a number considerably over a hundred
I shall be "assigned without pay." There
j exists a working possibility that the
j board will not stop at the abolition of four
I evening schools and the reclassification
j in the others, as ordered last Wednesday
i evening. The sewing, music and several
| other special classes escaped only by a
I bare margin. The cooking schools went
out early In the caucus. "Let their moth-
I ers get Into their kitchens and instruct
i the girls ln cooking," said a practical Di
; rector, and the others echoed the senti
i ment. The bookkeeping classes were last,
; because it was understood that the sup
> ply of young bookkeeping material in this
city would not be exhausted for ten years.
The classes In manual training went down
after considerable fighting. The Directors
were loth to cut off the chances of a boy
learning a useful trade, but these classes
had to be sacrificed in the scheme of re
trenchment.
The rule that only pupils of 14 years old
i and upward, and who are employed in the
daytime, could attend evening schools
was enacted to prevent the crowding of
those schools by children who passed
their daylight in Idleness and . attended
the evening classes for various reasons
i other than a desire to learn. The Nor
i mal School was abolished for a number
iof reasons, considered ample by the
I board, notwithstanding the storm of pro
i testing arguments raised over the mat
' t . en . 95 c Potent reason given by a prac-
I tical Director was that the school was
! established years ago, when teachers
were few. and that institution was the
supply station for the city schools. With
the flock of universities. State Institu
tions and i schools of pedagogy grinding
out educators there was no "want" left
for the San Francisco Normal School to
fill. So the proscribed schools and
; classes went out for cause, say the Di-
I rectors.

EPISCOPAL CONVENTION
COMPLETES ITS LABORS
Marked Progress of the Church in California Is
Joyfully Announced.
THE last session of the Episcopal
convention was called to order by
Right Rev. Bishop Nichols yester
day rooming in St. Paul's Church.
There was a fair representation of
;, delegates present when the morn
ing prayer, read by the rector, Rev. Wil
liam M. Reilly, began at 9 o'clock. Rev.
Charles S. Llnsley of Sonora read the
Scriptural lesson, and a benediction was
pronounced by Bishop Nichols.
After the spiritual communion with Di
vine Providence the members of the con
vention settled themselves down to the
serious discussion of business proposi
tions affecting the welfare of the Califor
nia diocese. The morning was entirely
taken up with the reports of various com
mittees, all of which showed the Episco
pal church in this State to be progressing
in a marked degree.
The principal question which came be
fore the convention was the providing of
an episcopal residence for the Bishop in
this city. Resolutions were introduced by
Major Hooper as follows:
Whereas, In the interest of the advancement
of the divinity school established by the Rt.
Reverend the Bishop of the Diocese, he has
felt it Incumbent on him to reside at San
Mateo; ar.d
Whereas, It is the concurrence of opinion
of a large majority of both priests and laity
of this diocese that the Interests of the church
would be greatly enhanced and benefited by the
residence of Its official head ln the see city
of this diocese; and
Whereas, It Is but just to ourselves that
such residence should be had and maintained
befitting the dignity of this branch of th*
American church: be it therefore
Resolved, That it is the sense and conviction
of this convention that such a residence should
be provided; and it is therefore
Resolved, That & committee of four ladles
and four gentlemen be appointed to take the
necessary steps to inaugurate and put into
effect this declaration, wish, intent and
bounden duty of this convention.
During the discussion Bishop Nichols
retired from the chair and A. N. Drown,
PROMINENT LAY DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION.
chancellor of the diocese, acted as chair
man pro tern. He appointed the following
ladles and gentlemen with power to elect
a chairman and add to their number if
deemed advisable: W. E. Dean, William
Babcock, Henry T. Scott, Major W. B.
Hooper, Mrs. S. Wilson. Mrs. W. Crock
er, Mrs. I. L. Pool and Mrs. George A.
Pope. Later in the day. on motion of
Major Hooper, Rev. William Carson Shaw
was placed on the committee, which will
report at the next convention.
On motion of General Houghton the
chair appointed a committee consisting
of J. F. Houghton, H. H. Howlett and A.
N Drown to memorialize the Legislature
to exempt church sites and the edifices
erected thereon from taxation.
Rev. Dr. E. B. Spalding read the re
port of the committee on Christian edu
cation and strongly urged endowment for
church schools, which are at present car
ried on by personal efforts by the prin
cipals His recommendation to place the
schools on a firmer basis met with marked
favor on the part of the delegates.
Rev. John A. Emery, in reporting for
the Board of Missions, made a plea for
the enlargement of the church's mission
field. Rev. Edgar Lion, for the San Fran
cisco convocation, said that contributions
last year had been most generous. W.
Lucas reported for the San Joaquin con
vocation that the past year had not been
very encouraging, but the outlook for
the present year was more hopeful. Dean
Lewis, for the convocation of San Jose,
said that the church debt in San Luis
Obispo is being rapidly paid off. Twelve
men are traveling, engaged in preaching
the Gospel, and only four were aided by
the Board of Missions.
The finance committee reported contri
butions as follows: For parochial pur
poses, $84,738 01; for the diocese, $8439 62;
for general objects. $690 01. The total
value of church property is $714,639 51.
Bills payable In. the sum of $82,553 61 were
presented, Sunday schools had contrib
uted $24SS 33.
There are now in the diocese 1 Bishop.
72 priests, 6 deacons. 9 candidates Â»for
deacon's and priest's orders, 19 lay read
ers, 33 parishes, 33 missions organized and
14 unorganized. Two cornerstones were
laid and one church opened in IS9S.
The number of families in the diocese
is 5584. There were 675 baptisms. 257 con
firmations, 539 communicants, 2SO marri
ages and 442 burials. There are 519 teach
ers and 6174 pupils in the Sunday schools.
Right Rev. . William Morris Barker,
Bishop of Olympia, then delivered an ad
dress, In which he compared the condi
tions existing at the present time with
those of twenty-six years ago, when he
first visited this city. "The growth of
the church," he said, "has been four
times greater west '- of tho Mississippi
than it has been in the East during the
last ten years." "
ln the absence of Bishop Morris of Or
egon, Rev. M. Garrett, rector of Trinity
IMPROVING- MISSION STREET.
A New Bridge Over Islais Creek With
Bitumen on the Roadbed.
Mission street west, formerly Mission
road, is now coming in for improvements.
Since the roadway became a continuation !
of Mission street proper it began to be
neglected by the Street Superintendent. J
In this way the old wooden bridge over j
Islais Creek, west of College Hill, fell into I
decay and became a source of danger to j
the many people whose business com- |
pelled them to drive over it. Now; how- I
ever, the street is undergoing repairs, and !
a new iron and stone bridge Is being built |
over the creek. -It is the Intention of both j
the contractor, and the Supervisors that
this bridge shall last for |at least half a
century. The abutment are of . con
crete, with culverts , leading * from < the
roadway Irito the bed of . the creek. In j
addition to this Mission street from Cres
cent avenue, on the summit of ." College j
Hill, to Silver avenue, about a mile far- 1
Church, Portland, was called upon for a
speech. In the course of his remarks he
said that the little diocese of Oregon gave
twice as much for missions as did the dio
cese of California, Dr. Garrett was com
missioned by the convention in a rising
vote to bear a message of greeting to
Bishop Morris.
Rev. Charles L. Mlel, speaking for. the
diocese of Sacramento, said that It had
a great territory, and he hoped that it
would soon have enough missionaries to
cover the field.
Rev. L. Sanford, rector of St. Paul's,
Salinas, and Rev. C. S. Linsley, mission
ary of St. James, Sonora, made felicitous
speeches, and Duncan Ferguson asked the
prayers of the assembled delegates for the
little mission in South San Francisco un
der his direction.
The afternoon session was called at 2
o'clock, and the subject of Sunday-school
work, which had been made a special or
der for that hour, was taken up. Rev.
William Carson Shaw addressed the dele
gates, making a strong plea for the or
ganization of an institution with appoint
ed officers to stimulate Sunday-school
work throughout the diocese. He earn-
estly asked the co-operation of the clergy
to make the institution effective. Rev.
W. I. Kip Jr. expressed himself as
strongly in favor of the proposed move
ment, and spoke of the advantages of a
central office in this connection. Rev. H.
E. Cooke declared that the education of
youth in spiritual things was a public and
not a private matter, and introduced res
olutions appointing a committee of five
for the purpose of forming a diocesan
Sunday-school institute. The chair ap
pointed Revs. H. E. Cooke, M. D. Wilson,
W. I. Kip Jr., W. C. Shaw and Dr. H. C.
Davis. , _ _
The committee on canons recommended
that the county of San Joaquin be trans
ferred to the convocation of San Joaquin.
The committee asked to be discharged on
the proposition of taking the power of the
Missionary Board to fix the stipends of
missionaries and placing it in the hands
of the Bishop. After considerable discus
sion, during which Rev. James S. Mc- =
Gowan took tne stand that the power
rightfully belongea to the Bishop, the
committee was discharged. -*" -
The convention then proceeded to tha
election of officers and the chair appoint
ed the following tellers: Standing- com
mitteeâRev.. W. A. Brewer, Mr. H. Tay
lor* boards of missionsâ James
Hulme. Mr. William Burbeck; incorpora

cessful. 2iy 2,: â¢â â¢
By unanimous vote the secretary was
ordered to cast the ballot for Rev-. David
McClure as registrar and A. IN. Drown as
chancellor of the diocese.
On motion of Rev. H. E. Cooke, second
ed by Rev. E. B. Spalding, it was resolved
to accept the invitation to hold the semi
centennial convention next year in Trin
ity Church, San Francisco. â¢_ _
The committee on church charities re
ported that the various institutions were
In excellent condition. The committee on
the state of the church reported that there
ther west, will be bituminized. This,
when finished, will make that nortion of
Mission street one of the prettiest drive
ways in the city. Dr. E. N. Torello pres
ident of the Mission and Five-mile Im
provement Club, and Meyer H.Levy, its
secretary, have labored hard and stead
fastly for improvements in the Excelsior
Homestead section of the Mission, arid
credit is due them for the success of their
efforts. _â 'â '-"_,â  , TV"
The question ; of getting electric lights
on Silver avenue, ; which , thoroughfare
leads from Mission ..', street -to the San

ilies scattered over a large area of the

Next in order come a demand for
a new schaolhouse. - The old barn In
which Miss Haggarty instructs the ris
ing r generation of the hills is unfit for
the use for which it was nailed together
twenty-five years ago, when it stood -on
Columbia street (East Mission)., Tn its
present condition it is said to-be unfit to
house a flock fof goats. * much less chil
dren. An engine house for the housing of
was large encouragement in the progress
of parishes and missions and the mission
ary offerings were above the average. The
church had received a new impulse during
convention week. There had "been a de
crease of $12,585 59 in the debt of the dio
cese during the past year. Resolutions
were adopted empowering the committee,
together with the secretary and the arch
deacon, to prepare a missionary map of
the diocese.
Rev. Robert Ritchie', rector of St. Paul's,
Oakland, presented resolutions, which
were adopted, testifying the appreciation
and thanks of the convention to the morn
ing and evening papers for their full and
complete publication of the proceedings.
Resolutions of thanks were also passed
to the rector and vestry of St. Paul's
Church for their hospitality and kindness
in extending the use of the church for
the purposes of the convention; to Right
Rev. William Morris Barker, Bishop of
Olympia, for his delivery of the sermon
at the consecration of Bishop Moreland;
to Major Hooper for his consistent and
abundant hospitality to the visiting dele
gates.
Rev. H. E. Cooke's resolutions of re
gret at the separation of Bishop W. H.
Moreland from this diocese and an ear
nest hope for his success in his new field
were adopted.
After the singing of a hymn, benedic
tion and prayer by Bishop Nichols the
convention adjourned sine die.
Bishops Banqueted.
Rev. William H. Moreland, the newly
consecrated Bishop of Sacramento, was
presented with a handsome solid silver
communion service for his private chapel
at the Episcopal palace at the capital by
the clergy of California at their annual
reunion banquet in the Occidental Hotel
last evening. v .
Bishop Nichols made the presentation
speech, and the recipient fittingly re
sponded. The banquet was an elaborate
affair, and was attended by the visiting
bishops and the entire clergy of this dio
cese. The table was in the form of a
horseshoe, and was profusely decorated
with ferns and cut flowers.
Bishop Nichols presided. Speeches were
delivered by Bishop Perrln of British Co
lumbia, Bishop Barker of Olympia, Bishop
Leonard of Salt Lake, Rev. Dr. Lusk of
New Haven, Conn.; Rev. F. H. Church
of Tacoma, Rev. R. C. Foute of Grace
Church, Chaplain Clark of the Seventh
Regiment of Los Angeles and Rev. H. R.
Ramsay of Santa Barbara.
At the conclusion of the banquet Bishop
Moreland was warmly congratulated by
his brethren.

CONFERENCE OF
THE BROTHERHOOD
The Cathedral Mission of the Good Sa
maritan was the scene of a most remark
able religious service yesterday after
noon, conducted by the Lord Bishop of
Columbia. The occasion was a quiet hour
in anticipation of the assembling of
the convention of St. Andrew's Brother
hood chapters of the Pacific Coast.
The hymn of the brotherhood was sung,
and in . a few words the preacher an
nounced his themesâ let me know
Myself," "Lord, let me know Thyself,"
"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
The addresses of the Lord Bishop were
direct and appropriate, and the large body
of men which filled the edifice were much
Impressed. '
The regular meetings of the convention
began at the Church of the Advent last
evening. After a short service by the Rev.
J. A. Emery, participated in by the sev
eral clergy present, the Pacific Coast
counselor, L. C. McAfee of San Francisco,
too.c the chair and called for the roll of
delegates present. Those from this city,
Fresno, Spokane, Seattle, Stockton, Peta
luma, Portland. San Mateo, Los Angeles.
New York, Sacramento and other cities
responded. A brief session was then held,
at which it was decided that a committee
be appointed to render any possible as
sistance in the arrangements for the tri
ennial conference, which is to be held in
this city in 1901. The same committee was
also instructed to do all in his power to
gain for the Pacific Coast the annual In
ternational conference of the brotherhood
for 1901.
Professor Bailey of the University of
California read a very carefully prepared

Church" followed. Mr. Mallock's paper
on "Brotherhood Influence In the Univer

ful. "Brotherhood Work In the Army"
was discussed by Major Noble, U. S. A.,
who eloquently pointed out the enormous
field for pious and effective work that the
army presented. I The "question box" was
ln charge of Dr. H. R. Braden, who was
quite equal to the occasion. A brief prayer
and benediction closed the services, which

BEWAILED THE
SAILING OF
THE SCANDIA
Officers and Privates
Left Behind.
HER DEPARTURE UNEXPECTED
VAIN EFFORTS TO OVERTAKE
THE SPEEDY TRANSPORT.
Disappointed Soldiers Drown Their
Sorrow in the Flowing Bowl.
The Morgan City Also
; Departs for Manila.
Instead of tossing on the waves of
the Pacific on the good ship Scandia,
two officers of the Twentieth Kansas
Regiment are tossing on beds of pain
at the Grand Hotel bemoaning their
ill fortune in missing the transport
that is bearing their command to south
ern waters. They are Captain J. F.
Morrison of Company I and Lieutenant
M. F. Smith. Both officers arrived
with their regiment on Wednesday af
ternoon, and being desirous of getting
more than a fleeting glimpse of this
city before departing, they secured
leave to go ashore. In their search for
attractions they forgot the hour of
sailing, and are now stranded on the
shores of San Francisco waiting for the
departure of another transport.
The officers are not the only disap
pointed ones. Non-commissioned of
ficers and privates are sharing their
sorrow. Unlike their superiors, they
were not given leave to go ashore, and
the sorrow is more poignant. Unlike
their superiors, they are not tossing on
beds of pain, but are drowning their ill
luck in bumpers of Barbary Coast
liquor, well knowing that severe pun
ishment will be meted out to them for
their willful desertion.
When Captain Morrison and Lieu
tenant Smith learned that their boat
had sailed they were frantic. They
speeded to the water front to charter
a tug in the hope of overtaking the
Scandia before she passed through the
Golden Gate, but their efforts were
futile. Bemoaning their fate both re
turned to the Grand to await orders
from the War Department. _'- r s;
A few non-commissioned officers and
a number of privates were also anxious
to taste of the delights of city life and
quietly slipped over the side of the
Scandia while she was lying alongside
the wharf, expecting to return by the
same route. Their disappointment was
great on their return to find their
transport gone.
When the transport Morgan City
sailed yesterday afternoon on her long
voyage to Manila, she went out of the
harbor with her lifeboats utterly out
of condition for use. This was a
flagrant breach of law.
The boats were filled with freight to
the gunwales, over which their canvas
covers were drawn and lashed down.
With the boats In such condition it
would, in case of disaster, be impossi
ble to get them clear for launching till
much precious time was lost. Not only
are the boats reported to be unfitted for
service, but the vessel sailed short
handed, a smaller number having been
shipped to take the berths of the old
crew discharged just before sailing.
It has been stated that a part of the
Morgan City's cargo was coffins in
which to bring back to their native
land the remains of soldiers who died
in the Philippines. This is denied by
J. Heldt, late a quartermaster of the
steamer. She had a lot of undertaking
supplies, but no coffins. The cargo of
bacon, of which so much was said, was
not removed and will become part of
the rations to be served out to the sol
diers at Manila. ~2y y

PREACHING THE

CALIFORNIA
Effective Work Being
Done at the East by a
Native Daughter.
MISS HELEN KELLEHER NO*
TABLE TRANS-CONTINENTAL
LECTURING TOT7R.
An Extraordinary Interest Being
Manifested by the People of the
East in Everything Per- y
taining to California. . \ y
Our readers will no doubt call to
mind that not long ago the Southern
Pacific Company, in connection with
the State Board of Trade, Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association, Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce and
other interests, arranged with Miss
Helen Kelleher, the well-known lec
turer on California, to deliver a series
of 100 lectures on our Golden State in
the principal cities of the Western,
Middle and Eastern States, the same
to be magnificently illustrated by over
200 catefully selected slides, artistically
colored and reproducing scenes surpris
ingly true to nature by a dissolving
view electric stereopticon, the largest
and most powerful ever used in this
country. S
For the further information of the
citizens of our city and State the pas
senger department of the Southern Pa
cific Company advises that the tour,
thus far, has met with extraordinary
success, notably in the cities of Chica
go, St. Paul, Cleveland, Detroit, Grand
Rapids, Springfield, 111., Lafayette, Ind.,
Kalamazoo, Mich., etc.
The season was inaugurated at the
Chicago Beach Hotel, December 1. be
fore an audience of 500 of the best peo
ple of that city. Subsequently it was
delivered before Chicago's swell club,
the Marquette, on which occasion
every seat was occupied, as well as
standing room. At Cleveland, January
2, the crowd was so great that hun
dreds of people were turned away from
the doors of the Y. M. C. A. auditorium,
being unable to obtain even standing;
room.
Miss Kelleher reports that an Intense
and unusual interest is being manifest
ed by the people of the East nowadays
in everything pertaining to California,
the Inhabitants having awakened, as it
were, to a better and stronger realiza
tion of the great attractions of our
State from the standpoint of health,
wealth and pleasure. The present se
vere winter throughout the East and
West has contributed in a great meas
ure toward intensifying this desire to
know more about the Golden State.
Miss Kelleher further reports that
her lecture and mission are meeting
with the highest praise from prominent
business men and would-be tourists,
who unhesitatingly admit that her de
scriptive and illustrated lecture is the
most effective means of advertising the
State of California that has ever been
devised. - ____..
A Chinatown Burglary.
Burglars visited the furnishing goods
store of Heringhi & Belasco at 805 Dupont
street last Wednesday night, and stole
$350 worth of silks, blankets, ladies'
cloaks, silk blouses, etc. One of the pad
locks on the front door was opened with
a skeleton key and the two other locks
were forced by the burglars. The store
was opened for the first time Wednesday
morning, and was visited by large crowds
of Chinese, examining the stock. The
store was crowded at night, and in the
crowd were several highbinders, who took
observations for their visit after mid
night. The burglars failed to leave their
visiting cards or any other clew by which
they might be identified. v

stantial progress upward to-day until the clos
ing dealings, when there was the usual profit

average of about a point, but leaving fair gains
for the day. Transactions were. In excess of a
million and a half, being the second largest
day in the history of the exchange. Expecta
tions of an early settlement of the peace treaty
and the firmness of Americans In London were
important features In the market's strength.
The unrest in the Philippine Islands was passed
unnoticed and has no appreciable effect on
trading. The grangers made extreme advances
of from 1 to 2%, the latter in St. Paul on Its
showing of a net increase for December of
5335,000. Northern Pacific and Union Pacific

Steel preferred at one time made notable gains. â 
Sugar, Glucose, Rubber, Pacific Mall and Ten- ]
nessee Coal and Iron were likewise strong fea- !
tures among the specialties. A number of low
priced stocks moved up sharply. The ease of
money, which is the backbone of current high
prices. Is shown by the quantity of funds of
fered for long periods on exceptionally easy
terms. It was reported that money had been
offered at 3 per cent for a year, and that large
sums were being received frofn â11 parts of the
country in New York. Pacifies and Chesa
peake and Ohio were purchased for London
long accounts, while other Americans were
traded In both ways. A number of commission
houses did the largest business to-day that they
had executed In many years. Their purchases
kept the traders on the long side until the
final dealings.

tensive demand for the middle-grade issues,
â which un 1 a ready market at advanced prices.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 26.â The bullish sentiment in
wheat, which got so well under way yester
day, continued with Increased energy at ! the
opening. Wheat leaped into the air wltsi a
buoyant' skip at the very start and offerings
were scarce at l@l%c over yesterday's close-
Even the few traders who for a minute or two
thought It worth while to risk to sell a little
short/ at such an advance soon changed their
minds and found it difficult 'to reinstate them
selves at 2c above the top price of Wednesday.
Buying orders from outside sources were nu
merous, urgent and apparently without limit
as to price. . The selling was evidently'con
fined for the most part to local scalpers who
had previously bought at ' lower prices. 1 The
crowd appeared to have made the alleged Wall
-1 street policy to "buy wheat when It Is- weak,
buy It when it is strong and buy it all the
time." May started at from 76@76%c, sold' in
heavy amounts for â  about fifteen minutes be
tween the opening figures and 75% c, chiefly
around 76% c, .and then rose excitedly to 77c.
In a few minutes It reacted to 76% con realiz
ing on profits by longs, then rose again to 77c,
and some l little brought 77% con the second
advance.
Liverpool was apparently forced Into recognl-,
tion of the strength prevailing here, spot wheat/
opening Id up and futures from 1%Â®1%d. |'./
Foreigners were largely short in May wheat i
here and in New York. One commission houÂ£c
that does a large foreign speculative business
was reported to have called margins from Eu
ropean customers up to 80c a bushel. Many
European shorts were said to have sent orders
to "buy In" the wheat. The announcement of
this caused the greatest excitement, and as or
ders kept coming from all quarters to buy
wheat May shot up ; to 79% c. That was a gain
of 4%c for the day, and as the majority of
traders had handsome profits coming they took
advantage . of . the excitement to secure them.
The liquidation became so general that inside
of fifteen minutes May. tumbled back to 77% c,
but as 'quickly started on the up turn again.
The advance was cut short* by the bell sound
ing the end of the session and May closed at
77%n. â 
There. was a broad general trading In corn,
with prices strongly under the Influence of
wheat. Wall street furnished the bulk of the
buying orders, | but any material advance was
checked by heavy selling from the country.
May closed â  %c higher.
Oats followed corn closely. During, the last
hour there â¢ was a good deal of excitement and
May started to climb rapidly, but In the last
fifteen minutes profit taking caused a decline
from the top.. May closed %f*~%c higher.
Heavy buying of pork by a. group of com
mission people strengthened provisions. Pack
ers sold freely on account of liberal receipts of
hogs and easier prices at the yards. May pork
left off 15c higher and lard and ribs 12% c each.

here do not seem to have been much Impressed
by the results of the raisin growers' mass meet
ing held -In Fresno on ' January 17 to devise
plana for the marketing of the current year's
crop. Many of them express entire Indifference
and those who had an opinion to express were
of the opinion that the packers', contract would
not be accepted. by many, as It gave the asso
ciation . most arbitrary powers and left J the
packers little. Some went so far as to say this
feature of the association's plans would prob
ably result In Its early dissolution by creating
strong and effective opposition.

landed by the Collector as a native-born *
and was arrested on a charge of being
illegally in the country. The record of her I
â¢ testimony as given before the Chinese
- Bureau was introduced and the girl de- j
. -clared that the testimony she had given I
: .on that occasion was false, and that she .
-. had been coached to so testify by a Chi- ,
. nese cook on the. steamer which brought
her from China to this port.
The girl said that she had been sent lor '
by Chin Mun Wai. her uncle, her parents '
': having died In China, and that on the :
. way the Chinese cook inquired as to her
; history. When she told him that she was â 
.. a native of California, that her parents

WEATHERED THE SOUTHEASTER.
The little schooner Stella Erland had _ rough time of it coming
here from Seattle. She has been purchased by Professor A. W. An

THERE WAS A
HOT TIME IN
THE OLD TOWN
It Broke All Records
for January.
PROFESSOR HAMMON RATTLED
v ;â :-.. yy -
CAN'T TELL WHERE THE HEAT
CAME FROM.
Fruit Trees Will Be in Danger Unless
a Cool Wave Comes Quickly.
The Eastern States Are . ' .â  . .
. , Freezing.
' All sorts of anathemas were hurled
at the weather man yesterday by the
perspiring, swearing sufferers from
the heat, but Professor Hammon posi
tively denies that he is responsible for
the rise in the temperature, and he
further asserts that he is unable to
give an explanation of what heHerms
"the phenomenon." The thermometer
reached the seventy-eight mark during
the day, which is the highest on record
for the month of January, and as all
of the atmospheric conditions were
favorable for cool weather no one is
able to offer a sane reason for the heat.
Should the temperature continue as
great as it was yesterday it is feared
that the fruit trees will blossom and
the crop be endangered, as It is hardly
possible that the remaining days of the
winter will pass without a frost.
Throughout the State, the mercury
took a jump during the past two days,
but San Francisco carried off the palm.
With the exception of San Luis Obispo,
where the ' thermometer registered 80
degrees, it was warmer in this city
than any other place in the State. Re
ports were received at the United
States "Weather Bureau late last evening
from all portions of California, includ
ing the southern cities, and while the
average temperature was in the neigh
borhood of 75 degrees, nowhere except
at San Luis Obispo was the mark set
by the metropolis equaled.
While Californlans are enjoying sum
mer heat the mid-winter Eastern cities
are suffering with the cold. At Omaha
yesterday the thermometer registered
4 degrees, at Chicago 10 and at Mani
toba 35 below zero, with everything
favorable for still colder weather.
Professor Hammon throws up his
hands when asked to explain the freak
weather. "By all signs," he said, "we
should have cool weather. For the past
three days It has been blowing a-per
fect gale on Mount Tamalpals. The
wind gauge registered from thirty to
sixty miles an hour.. The wind has
been dead in the north, and with the
mountains covered with snow * cool
weather is due. But all signs fail in
dry weather.
"I see no prospect of rain within the
next twenty-four hours, and it is
needed badly. Should this warm spell
continue for a week the fruit crop may
be Injured. This is excellent growing
weather and the fruit trees will begin
to blossom if it lasts much longer. The
chances are that there will be a frost
during the coming two months, and
should the buds burst before it comes
there would be considerable damage.
The sun I? now sucking up the mois
ture, in the ground, which it would be
preferable to have preserved until the
dry summer months. It is impossible
to tell how long this warm weather will
continue, but it is probable that it will
not let up within the next twenty-four
hours, and it may last longer.
"The heat of Wednesday when the
thermometer stood at 74*4, was the
highest since a record has been: kept.
Yesterday the mercury rose 3"_ degrees
higher than the previous day. On Jan
uary 6. 1857. the thermometer reached
as high as 73; December 8. 1893,- it stood
at 72: February 22, 1888, at 70. and
March 7. 18S2, at 8Â«. These are the high
est on record until to-day." .
In the "Divorce Court..
Mrs. Daisy M. Peterson has sued her
husband. Conrad H. Peterson, for a , di
vorce, alleging extreme cruelty as a cause
of action. Mrs. -ergon alleges that she
married her husband In 1893. but now.
through his cruel treatment, she seeks i
relief in the courts. Upon filing the com
plaint Mrs. Peterson * secured an â¢ order
from Presiding Judge Dalngerfield re- 1
straining her husband, from disposing of
his interest in the priming establishment
of Valleau &â  Peterson and other property
valued at $10,000, pending the determina- j
tion of the suit.
Oliver W. Winthrop's wife has appealed '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 27, 1899.
to the Superior Court for a decree of di
vorce on the ground that her husband has
been convicted of a felony. Winthrop was
sentenced to life imprisonment for the ab
duction and attempted blackmail of Mil
lionaire Campbell of Honolulu. Mrs. Win
throp asks that she be allowed to resume
her maiden name, Josephine A. Winfield.
Suits for divorce have also been filed
by Charles Frish against Gertrude Frish
for desertion, and by Casimer Cerviers
from Annie Cerviers for cruelty.
Decrees of divorce have been granted
Etuecia Schadde from William A. Schadde
on the ground of extreme cruelty, and
Mary Scharrer from Lewis H. Scharrer
on the ground of desertion. The plaintiff
was allowed to resume her maiden name,
Bowie.

MERCHANT BASTHEIM'S DEATH
Verdict of the Coroner's Jury and the
Result of the Autopsy.
Coroner Hill, assisted by Morgue Sur
geon Zabala. performed an autopsy yes
terday morning upon the body of Joseph
Bastheim. the merchant who was killed
in an elevator last Wednesday in the
building at 129 Sansome street.
All the organs of the body were found
in a normal and healthy condition. The
neck was broken in several places and
three ribs and the right clavicle were
fractured. Death resulted from the acci
dent. A verdict to that effect was ren
dered by the Coroner's Jury.
Coroner Hill's theory of the accident
Is that the deceased was looking down
from the elevator and failed to draw in
his head to avoid being struck by the
ceiling of the fifth floor. He was struck
on the top of the skull and thrown down
insensible, to be crushed the next moment
between the elevator and the celling.
Dr. Williamson was present at the au
topsy on behalf of the Fidelity and Cas
ualty Insurance Company, in which Insti
tution the deceased held an accident pol
icy. â 
WAS LAID TO REST
BESIDE IS MOTHER
IMPRESSIVE FUNERAL SERVICE
OF THE LATE DR. SULLIVAN.
The Cathedral Crowded With His
Friends â A Eulogy by Bishop
Riordan.
" 'â¢â -- 2' : .;j
Funeral services were held at St.
Mary's Cathedral yesterday morning over
the body of the late Dr. James F. Sulli
van. The scene was most Impressive.
The great edifice was crowded almost to
the doors. A solemn high requiem mass
was chanted, and Archbishop P. W. Rior
dan delivered the eulogy in honor of the
dead physician, whose life and abilities
had been given so generously to the serv
ice of his fellow-men.
Long before the candles gleamed about
the bier, which was placed before the
sanctuary rail, the cathedral began to fill
with its saddened congregation. There
were men and women of many creeds in
the throng, for the dead physician had, in
his life, ministered to many, and by his
kindness had been endeared to all.
At 10 o'clock there was the sorrowful
sound of the funeral dirge and the service
of death, a solemn requiem j mass,' had
begun. The music was under the direc
tion of Professor H. J. Harrison, and the
following vocalists: Miss Katherine Black,
Miss Julia Sullivan. Professor Sand, Mr.
Manlloyd and chorus. The officers of the
mass were as follows: â â¢ Celebrant. Rev.
Father Harrigan; deacon. j Rev. Father
Charles A. Kamm; sub-deacon, Rev. Father
Dempsey; master of ceremonies, Very
Rev. Father Prendergast, vicar general.
Among those present in the sanctuary
were the Most Rev. P. W. Riordan,
Archbishop of San . Francisco, and Rev.
I Fathers Mulligan, Wood and. Butler.
The eulogy upon the dead' physician was
delivered eloquently and impressively by I
Archbishop Riordan. In the course of his I
tribute, Archbishop Riordan said:
"Death comes to us all, and we are re- j
minded when on* of our friends is called :
to meet his God -that" we should always
be prepared for the inevitable end of this 'â¢â 
life. Now death has claimed one of my j
dearest friends. Dr. Sullivan, a friend of i
thirty-three years.
"I knew him when he was a young !
physician in a city far distant from here,
and as the duties of the priest and the j
physician are often duties common to ,
both. 1 used to meet my friend in the ,
bedroom of the sick and of , the dying :
when 1 was performing the offices that !
fell to me as a young priest. My friend, !
whose honored life has ended, was pos- j
sessed of the greatest kindness of heart
and large charity and generosity. He was
always the friend of the poor.
3 "When I was appointed Archbishop of i
San Francisco, the first - letter of con- ',
gratulation which I < received from . tho
Pacific Coast was from Dr. Sullivan. He !
was ever a firm Catholic, believeing and '
practicing the teachings of his faith. He j
has done untold good in ministering -to i
the spiritual needs of the dying while. re- i
Having, at the same -time, their * physical
distress.- .' .", â  " ' _>'â â â 
"Now that he is gone he will have al
ways the prayers, of the poor and the.
tears of his friends. In conclusion. I wish
to express a hope that all young physicians
will emulate his example and maintain
his principles of honor, faith and devotion
to duty. .:,-., .; 4 ;
At the conclusion of the . Archbishop's
eulogy ' the â¢â¢ requiem mass was resumed.
When It was ended and a. benediction had
been pronounced, the * funeral cortege
started on "its way to Calvary Cemetery.
The honorary pallbearers: were as fol
lows: David Farquharson, T. F. Butler,

Outlines Vividly the Battle of Manila
and the Bravery of a Well
. Known Newspaper
Correspondent.
Rev. Francis Brooke Doherty, the Paul
ist missionary, who lately returned from
Manila, where he served through the late
war as chaplain .on General -â  Merrltt _
staff, gave to his audience last evening
at Metropolitan Hall, on the subject of
"With the Army at Manila," one of the
most vivid descriptions of Manila,, the
battle, the heroism of the boys in blue,
and, in fact, the war itself from the time
of commencement until the signing of the
final treaty of peace, that has yet been
presented to the public of this city. The
lecture was given for the benefit of the
Catholic Truth Society.
The speaker was introduced by Dr. A.
j P. O'Brien, who also, recently . returned
from his duties as surgeon to the First
California Regiment, stationed at . Ma
nila. He said in part:
"Peace is the better partâ it is the true
relation of life when all charity and jus
! tice is fulfilled; but besides that steady
! movement of men the ebb and flow of
j endeavorâ the tides in the affairs of men
â¢ which lead on to fortuneâ there are at
I times great tidal waves of energy arising
I when some volcanic ] gathering, . repressed
| for a while, shakes the earth beneath the
i waves. Then old landmarks are obliter
ated, headlands are buried beneath the
â¢ waves and new divisions are formed to
I change the chart of the world. This is
; the work of war, terrible and devastating,
I sweeping away the labor of centuries and
; engulfing hosts of precious lives.
"The religious community to which I
i have the privilege of belonging is never
I behind on occasions of this kind. Filled
with the spirit that animated the Ameri
i can humorist when he wanted to. offer
! upon the altar of - his country all his
; wife's relations, they said. 'Let us send
Father Doherty.' This compliment I ap
| predated. â¢ '"
After the story of the voyage the
I lecturer described the situation of the
! Philippines, their inhabitants, their mode
of living and their various character
istics. An Interesting description was on
! the subject of Aguinaldo. His first head
! quarters at Cavite were spoken of. and
the lecturer's own visit and interview in
! terestingly pictured. The Filipino lead
er's personality was cited and his im
. passive character outlined. "Aguinaldo."
; said the priest, "is an ordinary man, with
jan extraordinary amount of common
' sense and with an Oriental imagination,
which plays as many tricks with facts and
fiction as does an Egyptian juggler."
In speaking of the attack on Manila
; and its occupation by the American troops
j the lecturer spoke of the gallant entrance
> of General Merrltt within the walls and
1 his own detail to follow the- general with
' the Oregon regiment. Â« '.'The first one I
! met at the shore." he said, "was the Ex
aminer correspondent, who asked -me
j anxiously ' if there had', been any 'news
j paper man In before him. "I answered
'No,' for I knew nothing of the fact that
i Sol Sheridan of The Call was fighting his
1 way into the city with the California men
: and was the first to cross the bridge In
| that direction."
Colonel James Smith was characterized
: as the Roosevelt of the Philippine expe
dition. "Roosevelt declined a brigadier
', generalship," he said. "Colonel Smith
' does not want the position. His highest
i ambition has been gained ln the splendid
! record of his regiment, and his . greatest
joy will be to bring that regiment back
j and lead it in honor through -the streets
jof San Francisco. These are men who
; have served their country well, who have
borne abroad the stars and stripes."
The lecture was concluded with a clear
! definition of American spirit as the lec
j turer rightly understood It: "My coun
. try, may she ever be rightâ but, right or
; wrong, my country!"
LARGEST COURSING STAKE.
Ninety-One Greyhounds Will Bun at
Ingleside Park.
If warm and sunny weather has any
thing to do with bringing out the running
powers of a Merced Jackrabblt. then it
can safely be said that the coursing at
Ingleslde Park Saturday and Sunday will
be of the grueling order. The game
keeper is authority for the statement that
a few private trials that took place yes
terday proved that the hares had re
gained their old long-distance form, and
that runs of two and three miles will be
witnessed on Saturday. '
The drawing for the coming meeting
took place last evening, and resulted in
| a 72-old dog stake and a 19-dog sapling
stake, which means that little delay can
be taken when running off the dogs, or
otherwise the finals will be determined
after dark. .

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
BROSNAHAN IS
IN CONTROL OF
THE COMMITTEE
Is Elected Chairman
by Democrats.
LAYMANCE WING ON TOP
INDEPENDENT BEPUBLICANS
HOLD PBIMARIES.
Bey. Dr. Coyle Explains Why He
Signed the Petition of Coun
cilman Wood
ward.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway. Jan. 26.
The Democratic Committee of Twenty- '
one has organized with the election of
Con Brosnahan as chairman. The little
difficulties that existed in the Fifth and
Seventh wards have been adjusted, nnd
to-morrow evening the committee will be
prepared to name the delegates who shall
compose the convention to nominate a
municipal ticket next Tuesday night.
R. M. Fitzgerald is taking no active part
in the city campaign and has apparently
realized that the opposition to him is in
complete control, for he has not appeared
except by proxy at any of the meetings.
In the Seventh Ward the Fitzgerald man
did not appear with M. J. Laymance to
choose a third man who should name the
delegates from that ward, and therefore
Mr. Laymance was forced to act alone.
In the Fifth Ward matters were adjust
ed by allowing the Fitzgerald men, H. C.
Mi Pike and B. F. McFadden, to choose
the delegates, and the Laymance men are
absolutely In control of the convention.
The election of Con Brosnahan as chair
man is somewhat of a surprise. Mr.
Brosnahan was chairman of the County
Central Committee when It was In
control of R. M. Fitzgerald and
he is always looked upon as bein^r a
and be Is always looked upon as being a
Fitzgerald man. Now it would appear
that he is on the other side of the fence,
and so little opposition was manifested to
his election that there was no necessity
for a rollcall throughout the proceedings.
The independents are holding club pri
maries this week and will nominate a
complete ticket next Monday night. They
are skirmishing for some strong Republi
can to head their ticket, but nothing defi
nite has yet been made public regarding
their nominee. BRtB
Councilman Woodward is circulating a
petition to go on the ballot as an inde
pendent candidate for Councilman from
the Fifth Ward. Some surprise was
caused when Woodward exploited the
fact that the name of Rev. Dr. Coyle was
on his petition. When spoken to about
the matter Dr. Coyle said that he signed
the petition, but that Mr. Woodward
knows that he will not get his vote. Dr.
Coyle believes that Woodward has a right
to run if he wants to, and says that no
one will be Influenced to vote for him. no
matter whose names are on his petition.
The position In the Fifth Ward is enig
matical. The Municipal League and -the
Republicans have united on Felton Taylor,
an energetic young Republican of busi
ness ability and not a politician. The
Lake Merrltt improvement Club has In
dorsed Councilman Woodward to a cer
tain extent. There will probably be a
straight Democrat nominated from the
ward and it is not impossible that the ex
perience of two years ago may be repeat
ed, when two reliable Republicans ran
against each other and permitted the
election of a Democrat, who afterward
resigned, and who was succeeded by
Woodward, the appointee of Mayor
Thomas, and whose actions and vote were
directly responsible for the water rate
scandal of last spring.
POISONED FAMILY
ARE RECOVERING
THE AGENT FOR THE HOMINY
MAKES INQUIRY.
Believes That an Analysis Will
Show That the Food Was
Pure.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 26.
The family of Mrs. Minnie Norton, which
was poisoned by eating hominy, are out of
fill danger, but still quite sick.
Mr. Shane, who sold the hominy to
Mrs. Norton, says that he is not in any
way responsible for the unhappy result
of eating it. "There was one little error
in the statement made this morning,"
said Mr. Shane. "It says that I have a
Stall in the free market. But that is not
the case. I have only handled the hom
iny for two days and do not know how
It is prepared or what is done with it.
1 was very much surprised to learn that
the Norton family were taken sick after
eating it. and I have determined not to
handle it any more.
"The parties who sold it to me are posi
tive that it was good, and have visited
many other places where It is sold and i
have found no one sick. They went to '
Mrs. Norton's to-day and asked for a
sample of what they had eaten intending
to have it analyzed, as they an- certain
that if the children were poisoned It was
not through anything contained In the I
hominy when it left their establishment. ;
"1 have visited the Norton? to-day. and
they are still sick, but as they had thrown
away all the hominy we could get no i
sample for analysis'. Mrs. Norton is mis- |
taken in saying that when I sold her the
hominy 1 did not know whether It was
good or not. I have told her that I did
no! prepare it And did not know how to
prepare it. but if I had not believed It to i
be perfectly pure and wholesome nothing ;
on earth could have persuaded me to sell
any."
Mr. Shane has been handling goods from â¢
house to house in Oakland for many years ,
and his patrons, are ready to support his j
statements.

DEFENSE CHABGES FBAUD.
Trial of the Sensational Francoeur-
Jones Suit Begun.
OAKLAND, Jan. 26.â The trial of the
sensational suit of George H. Francoeur
against E. Norwood Jones and his di
vorced wife, Gertrude H. Jones, was com
menced before a jury in Judge Ells
worth'3 court to-day. The action is
brought for the recovery of $500 on a
promissory note made May 1, 1597.
The defense charges fraud, and sensa
tional developments are anticipated.
Judging from the opening statement on
behalf of the defense, made by Attorney
_. L. Hutchinson. He outlined at length
the story of how Mrs. Jones lost over
$2000 to shield her husband from disgrace,
it being alleged that he was Intimate with
Annie Johnson, a young girl who died
at her home on Twelfth street, and of
whose murder Jack Howard and Hulda
Johnson were suspected. Many sensa
tional facts in connection with the pres
ent suit were brought out some months
ago when Attorney Hutchinson was de
fendant in disbarment proceedings Insti
tuted by Henry Beatty in reply to seri
ous charges made by Hutchinson in the
answer to the suit brought by Francoeur.
Hutchinson was exonerated, and in his
opening statement to-day spared no
one. He contended that Mrs. Jones at
the time of making. the note thought It
was a mortgage for $100, and counsel in
conclusion said that the defense would
show Francoeur's services to Jones and
his wife were tainted with fraud.
E. Norwood Jones is serving sentence
in the Knoxvllle (Term.) State Prison for
forgery, and some months ago his deposi
tion was taken. In this deposition Jones
avers that he had received a letter from
Francoeur wherein the latter had threat
ened to expose his connection with the
Annie Johnson case unless he. signed the
note; that the letter was lost, but tnat
such was its contents. .
Attorney Beatty for the plaintiff objected
to the amlssibilitv of the deposition. He
said: "I would suggest. that this Jury be
dismissed until the attorneys can agree
as to what parts of the deposition should
be admitted before the jury. It contains
many statements that are immaterial and
scandalous. Indeed, we object to a con
vict ln Tennessee uttering lies and scan
dalous remarks."
The case went over until to-morrow
morning to give the defense another op
portunity of securing the letter referred
to. 'Jones says it Is probably among his
old papers In San Francisco.
GRAVE CHARGES MADE
BY ANNETTE P. CLARK
HEB CONTEST OVEB OLIVE J.
WICKES' ESTATE.
Dr. J. __. Shannon Sued for Valuable
Property Belonging to the
Estate.
OAKLAND. Jan. 26.â The contest over
the estate of Olive Jane Wiekes, who
died at Fabiola Hospital last November,
wherein Annette P. Clark seeks to pre
vent the Issuance of letters of administra
tion to Dr. James M. Shannon, was to-day
set by Judge Hall for hearing February 13.
The will filed by Dr. Shannon is dated
October 5", 1898. witnessed by A. H. Pratt
and is signed by Mrs. Wiekes' cross. By
Its terms property located at Fresno, val
ued at $10,000. Is left to testatrix's
"friend and physician, Dr. James .M.
Shannon."
Contestant, Annette P. Clark, charges
fraud on the part of Dr. Shannon, and
she moreover contends that since Mrs.
.Wiekes was not a resident of Alameda
County the courts here have no jurisdic
tion.
To-day Annette P. Clark filed suit
against Dr. J. M. Shannon for the recov
ery of the property belonging to Mrs.
Wiekes' estate. The complaint recites
that she is the executrix of the estate of
Alfred M. Wiekes, who died In San
Francisco December 24 last, and whose
wife last October was under the care and
control of Dr. Shannon, she being af
flicted with a cancer; that Dr. Shannon's
relation to Olive W'lckes was that of a
physician, and as such he exercised un
due influence over her whereby he In
duced her to sign away her estate to him.
"At a time when her mind was weak
ening, on or about October 1,. 1898," says
the complaint, "when. by. reason of her
sickness she had physically become in
capable to understand- the result of her
acts, and no longer could write her name,
defendant produced before her a draft of
a deed purporting to convey to himself
as the grantee and for valuable, consid
eration the hereinabove described prop
erty," which Is located in Fresno, valued
at $10,000. . . Â»
Continuing, the complaint recites "that
still pursuing his evil designs and hav
ing discovered that Mrs. Wiekes had the
sum of $1665 07 deposited in the Hlbernla
Bank, San . Francisco, ho did then and
there, on or about October 7, cause to be
filled on a blank page of her bank book,
left there for that purpose, an assignment
of said account and money unto himself."
Plaintiff asks that a receiver be ap
pointed; that Shannon be enjoined from
disposing of the property and that he be
ordered to convey the property to her as
executrix of the estate of Alfred W'lckes,
husband of the late Olive Wiekes.
It leaked out this afternoon that several
weeks prior to October 5* 1898, another will
was drawn for Mrs. W'lckes in the office
of Attorney. Ben W'oolner, .wherein noth
ing was bequeathed to either Alfred M.
Wiekes or Dr. J. M. Shannon. What be
came of this will is a matter of conjec
ture, but may have some bearing on the
present contest. -;'.:'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 27, 1899.
NOT A HOLDUP,
BUT A EIGHT
WITH BAKERS
Collier Not Struck
With a Jack.
HIT BY AN OFFICER'S CLUB
FAKE STO BY WAS TOLD TO THE
HOSPITAL STEW ABD. ".
Officer Stahl Justified in Breaking
Up a Bow on Washington
Street in the Early
Morning.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 26.
Another sensational hold-up mystery
has been solved, and what was thought
to be a very remarkable circumstance Is
but an ordinary Incident.
Early Wednesday morning J. J. Collier,
a saloon-keeper, who was a candidate for
I Constable of Oakland Township, appeared
; at the Receiving Hospital with a severe
gash in his head. He told Steward Borch-
I ers that he had been attacked on "Wash
. ington street by two fellows at 3 o'clock
In the morning, one of whom had struck
! him viciously on the head with a black
; jack. The two fellows. Collier said, had
j been put out of his saloon early in the
i evening for misbehavior and had followed
and attacked him on Washington street.
Washington street is well lighted all
night, and is within sight of the City Hall
i police station, and Collier's story was re
' garded with suspicion. Now it Is learned
i that the blackjack was Officer Stahl's
! club and that he had good cause to use it.
j Collier and a friend were walking down
f Washington street early in the morning,
j and on passing the Palace bakery they
i saw a skid on the -sidewalk at the en
i trance to the cellar, bakehouse, which was
! open. One of them. It Is stated, kicked
; the skid Into the bakery and narrowly
I escaped striking one of the bakers on the
head. The bakers, four in number, rushed
up the steps, and the first one was met
! with a stiff blow between the eyes. The
bakers and Collier and his friend were all
mixed on the sidewalk, shouting and hit
ting and kicking each other..
Police whistles were blown from the
Crellin Hotel, and Officer Stahl was quick
ly at the scene. He saw that he had a
difficult Job to break the half-dozen men
apart and that one of the bakers was on
the ground and two men were kicking
him. Stahl drew his club and struck one
of the kickers a heavy blow on the head.
This brought matters to a crisis, and then j
it was discovered that the injured man i
was Collier. Stahl says that had the man !
been his brother he believes he would '
have struck him with his club under the
circumstances.
As no one expressed a desire to have
arrests made, the parties were allowed to j
depart, and Collier went to the Receiving
Hospital, where his wounds were treated. !
Mr. Wagner, proprietor of the Palace \
baker>*. says all that his men did was
perfectly Justifiable, as one of them was
j very nearly hit by the skid which was
j sent flying down Into the bakehouse.

ROSORMONDE
TOO SPEEDY FOR
OLD RUBICON
The Mare Stepped a
Fast Mile.
FIVE FAVORITES DEFEATED
THE BOOKS NOW HAVING AN
INNING.
Wyoming Finished First at Bemu
. nerative : Odds Captive Showed
Bare Bacivan and
Yaruba Score.
The sport at Oakland track yesterday
was replete with surprises. The pro-,
gramme catered mostly to the cheaper
class of horses, but proved a strong draw
ing card, judging by the attendance. Five
favorites were beaten, and the books
reaped a golden harvest.
, Of all the upsets, the defeat of the odds
on choice, Rubicon, by Rosormonde was
the most sensational. The dainty daugh
ter of Ormonde, with Bullman on her
back, picked up 102 pounds, and in the
fifth event of the day led the big chestnut
horse from wire to wire, winning by two
lengths in 1:39%. There were but two
other starters, and Limewater took the
show from the second choice, Morlnel.
The winner was 6 and 7 to 1 In the betting.
In the opening five furlong scramble for
| maidens several good things were cut
j loose, proving disappointments. Racivan,
| with Eddie Jones up, led from the jump,
i and at the wire led the 15 to 1 shot Side
' long out over two lengths. Romany, the
! favorite, was third. Bid Mc, all the way
from Reno, cut a sorry figure, being
lamentably short of speed.
The Elmwood farm's Meadow Lark was
considered the one cinchy favorite of the
day. The Brutus gelding closed a 9 to
10 chance, and Mr. Ferguson's Australian
gate effort closed his career. Wyoming,
at one time as good as 10 to 1, headed Fly
in the stretch and scored with Henry
Shields looking back. Cavallo, with Sni-
I der up, came strong at the end, downing
I Fly for place honors. - -,".-"^
Then came another big bunch of maid
ens in a five furlong spin. Nearly every
I one. of the twelve starters had friends,
with My Dear closing favorite. She was
never dangerous. Yaruba, from the sta
ble of Galen Brown, piloted by Henry
Shields, won ridden out from Racebud.
The latter was backed from 60 down to
15 to 1.
| A. cheap collection of speed faced the
barrier in the mile selling run, for which
Castake went to the post favorite. Rid
den by little Reiff, the gelding had speed
to burn in the sail home, finishing a
couple of lengths ahead of None Such at
the stand. After making the pace, Master
Daly and his mount, Balllster, ended up
in third place.
Bookmaker Caesar Young's mare. Ma
mie G. enjoyed first call In the betting on
I the final event of the day, a mile selling
affair. She proved another disappoint
: ment, never getting to the front. Old
* Captive, with Piggott up. collared Amelia
Fonso in the stretch and won with com-
I parative ' ease in 1:40 flat. The favorite
! was third. y'syy. -*:-'.
Track Notes.
Barney Schreiber yesterday disposed of
two of his string. He sold Ulm to Charley
Fink and Racivan to P. Ryan. - For the
latter he obtained $200.
; Bookmaker, Johnny. Coleman narrowly
escaped losing a bank roll of $5500 before
the track . was . reached : yesterday. While
still aboard the train Cashier George Suy
dam asked the, sheet writer of the Stuy
vesant Club. to carry the cash up to the
track. He nodded : assent, but it : there-
skipped his memory in talking over
the day's ."dope" and the bank roll was
left on the car seat. The train messenger
spied the leather bag and notified the con
ductor. Coleman later received a wire
from Oakland Mole saying the money was
safe. The honest messenger was hand
somely rewarded, -v "V -- â¢â¢..â¢/â¢. -\r-yy ,â¢>*.::.

SCHOOL BOARD
POLITICS AT A
SECRET SESSION
Director Stow and Superinten
dent Webster Attempt to Dis
miss Mrs. McPherson.
A Plea of Economy That Might Have
Served a Double Purpose in the Poly
technic High School-Favored
Vice-Principals Uncertain.
THERE have been few sessions of l
the Board of Education which have
excited such general public interest
as that which was held on Wednes- j
day night. The public meeting that |
was held on Wednesday was simply i
the formal ratication of what had been |
done in executive session. None of the I
discussions which animated the private I
meeting were heard. None of the inter- |
esting debates that might have been of j
public moment were continued in the
presence of the public. Among the many j
affairs considered by the board .n exec
utive session of the committee of the
whole one was of particular signilicance.
This measure had reference to the Poly
technic High Schoc; and the instructor
ship held by Mrs. S. W. McPherson. A
very determined effort was made to
abolish the position held by Mrs. Mc-
Pherson. It Is claimed that this effort
was made by Superintendent of Schools
Webster, his cousin, Principal Bush ofthe
Polytechnic School, and School Director
Vanderlynn Stow, to provide a place for a |
favorite. The endeavor was not success- !
ful, but it was not altogether a failure, '
and will be considered at the next meet- |
ing of the board. The affair created con- i
siderable comment, and served to show !
that there are wheels within wheels even
In the machinery of a reform School I
Board. I
Mrs. McPherson has been a teacher in
the School Department for several years. j
She is now the head of the department of
mathematics in the Polytechnic High ;
School. On Wednesday night Superin
tendent Webster and Director Stow urged
the abolition of the position held by Mrs.
McPherson on the ground that it is not ,
necessary to the school. The position tak- ]
en by the Superintendent is extremely pe
culiar as he once held the very position |
he seeks to abolish.
In urging the abolition of the position
Superintendent Webster declared that as !
economy Is the motto and the purpose of
the board he thought it would be advan
tageous to abolish the position of head of
the department of mathematics. Inci
dentally it was remarked that Principal
Bush, the relative of the Superintendent,

MAN, NEARLY SUFFOCATED.

The Fire Fiend Visits Myers, Car
rack & Williams for the Third
Timeâ The Cause Not
Known.
The Pacific Box Factory at the corner
of Fourth and Kentucky streets was
destroyed by fire last night. The flames
were discovered shortly after 11 o'clock
and an alarm was turned in imme
diately, but within twenty minutes
after the fire was first seen and almost
before the Fire Department had
reached the spot, the establishment
had been burned to the ground. Shav
ings, light boxes, lumber and other in
flammable matter in the factory made
excellent fuel for the fire fiend, and
when he had finished his work nothing
was left but ashes.
The blaze burned brilliantly for about
twenty minutes. Large sparks and
burning shreds of lum" cr flew through
the air at a lively rate. These fell for
200 yards around .he burning* building,
igniting boathouses, cooperage works,
lumber piles and furniture factories in
the vicinity, and it. looked for a time
as if the entire portion of the city
would be consumed. Watchmen and
policemen kept a lively lookout, how
ever, and very 'ttle damage was done
to the surrounding buildings. '.. "
"Tim" Gleason, 70 years of age, the
night watchman of the box factory,
was in the second floor of the building
.when the lire broke out. He smelled
the smoke and in attempting to locate
the fire was nearly suffocated by the
fumes. Being unable to find his way
from the building he sought a window
and called for help. His cries were
heard by Night Watchman Fred Hale
and Policeman Jordan, who broke open
a door and making their way to the
second floor succeeded In rescuing him.
The flames were first discovered by
Policeman Jordan and Watchman Hale
while ' they were standing hear' the
bridge on Fourth street. This was
about 11:10 o'clock and the officers
turned in an alarm from box 512. A
second alarm from the same box was
sounded within a few minutes and then
a third was rung in from Fourth and
Townsend streets. Jordan says he first
saw fire in the second story on the
Kentucky-street side of the factory,
just above the engine-room, and it is
believed that the blaze started in the
shaving-room, which is next to the en
gine-room. The origin of the fire is
not known, as it is positively stated
that there was no fire in the building
after C o'clock. f-^.y. ,
The box factory is owned by Myers,
Carrick & Williams, and this is the
third time they have been burned out.
They formerly owned a box factory at
Fifth and Brannan streets. This was
burned twelve years ago and after be
ing rebuilt went up in smoke ; some
years after. It was this fire which,
spreading to the houses in the neigh
borhood, rendered so many poor families'
I is a mathematician and can assume the
duties now performed by Mrs. McPher-
Son. A majority of the members of the
board did not take kindly to these sug
gestions, and after considerable discus
sion the matter was laid over for con
sideration to the next meeting.
In the discussion Wednesday night it
was shown that the law will not permit
the board to reduce arbitrarily* the salary
of a teacher. As head of the department
of mathematics. Mrs. McPherson receives
$155 a month. If she were degraded in
rank she would be reduced to a salary of
$140 a month. Those who urged the aboli
tion of the place held by Mrs. McPherson
, saw a way to cheat the law. but promised
that they would not dismiss Mrs. Mc-
Pherson from the department. Under the
provisions of the scheme Mrs. McPherson
was to receive another place.
The effort made to remove this teacher
prompted an Inquiry by some members of
the board, and it 'was claimed that cer
tain very honorable reformers of the de
partment were striving quietly to engineer
to success a little scheme of their own.
It is said that the way was being paved
to give Mrs. McPherson's place to John
B. Clarke, another instructor the Poly
technic High School. It Is not by any
means a new device to abolish a position
to get rid of its holder and then -create it
to provide for some one else.
When the School Board has finished its
heavy labor of consolidating teachers
very little else will be done to place the
School Department on what the Directors
believe to be a legitimate and economical
basis. As far as the members of the
board and the Superintendent can see no
further consolidation will be needed either
in the day schools or the night schools.
Rearrangement ' and readjustment will
follow slowly, but after the first day of
next month there will be but . very few
dismissals.
After order has been brought out of
chaos the board will then direct Its at
tention to the horde of vice principals
that were created by the last School Di
rectors. The last board endowed several
grammar schools with two vice principals
and many primary schools with one vice
principal each. Every endowment of this
sort meant an increase of salary to each
favored teacher. The board intends now
to rescind the action of its predecessors
and restore the schools to their former
condition.
destitute. The firm came into posses
sion of the factory which burned last
night about four years ago. A box
factory which had been on the site
burn and the property was purchased
by the present owners.
The first of this year the factory was
entirely overhauled. New engines and
boilers and two complete sets of box
machinery were put in. The factory
has been working full time with a large
force of men for some months past and
when the fire broke out last night the
building was filled with a large quan
tity of completed orders ready for ship
ment to Mexico. There were about
three million feet of lumber in the
yards adjoining the factory and this
was more or less burned. Over a hun
dred men and boys are thrown out of
employment by the burning of the fac
tory.
Mr. Carrick, of the firm, was on his
way home from the theater with his
family when he saw the blaze. From
the street car he perceived that it was
his factory which was burning and
reached the factory almost as quickly
as the Fire Department.
"I left the factory at 6 o'clock." he
said, "and at that time everything wa
in good shape. The fires under the boil
ers had all been drawn and in fact had
they not been there could have been
no danger from that quarter. We use
shavings for fuel altogether and if the
fire is not fed it goes out within a few
minutes. There is no question but
what the 'fire started in the shaving
room, but how I am at a loss to explain.
There is no smoking allowed in the
factory, and besides, the men had all
been away from the place for hours. I
would hate to think that any one set
the place on fire and I know of no per
son so unfriendly to us that he would
do such a thing. We have been giving
our men steady and paying employ
ment, and all seemed perfectly satis
fled."
On being asked to make an estimate
of his loss Mr. Can-ink' said that he
could not tell until he learned how
much of the lumber had -been saved.
"We valued the factory at $40,000, and
would not have "cared to dispose of it
at that figure," he said. "On the build
ing and contents we carried in the
neighborhood of $14,000 insurance. The
factory is 'of- course a total loss. Tak
ing out the insurance, we are out about
$26,000. How much of the lumber is
saved it is hard to determine, but I
fear that the larger part of it has been
burned."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 27, 1899.
INNOCENCE
CAUSED THEIR
SAD UNDOING
Fair Buds Fall Because They
Understand Not the Mixing of
Swell Oakland Punch.
Society Matrons Offer Timely Suggestions.
Would Not Educate the Girls, but
Abolish the Punchâ Merits of Pink
Lemonades and Ice Water.
OAKLAND is seething. The City of
Churches is in the throes of a social
scandal, utilizing all its great minds
and spending all Its spare moments
in the attempted solution of a vex-
ing problem. "Shall it be lemon
adeâproperly made or punch?" has
become Oakland's legitimate successor to
the perplexing "Shall we keep the Philip
pines?" -
Naturally each side of the question finds
its adherents and its opponents, and
whether it is the tempting punch or the
cooling lemonade that comes out victor,
it will not be without a hard-fought and
warmly contested battle.
Although divided on the beverage ques
tion, the city stands firm and pat in its
sympathy for its poor, unsophisticated,
misguided buds. The girl who required a
strong, sober arm to steer her biased
footsteps across the ballroom, the dainty
miss who perforce had to accept assist
ance so she might rise from the table, and
even the debutante who fell a victim to
the punch within the very walls of
classic Berkeley, all, all alike, find shelter
under the protecting Oakland chaperones'
wings.
Poor, poor thing," they say, "how could
she know the evil effects of 'so sparkling
and well tasting a liquid? In her innocence
she must be protected, and punch with
truly champagne in It must be henceforth
banished or else the pernicious results ac
cruing from too frequent visits- must be
scientifically explained to her."
The bud herself, it appears, is in favor
of scientific explanation. The matrons
are divided on the subject. The dude who
counts for much in the dancing est vol
unteers the information that rfTormatioh
must begin with the chaperone. Says the
wise dancing man, "If 1 can fill the chap
erone up first, then the bud would come
easy." â¢*-.'.
In the matter of reform, however, Oak
land chaperones . aye positively decided
upon two things: First, that the road
side house must be discouraged, and sec
ondly, that an Oakland Greenway is an
absolute necessity. Bicycle parties and
a restful tarry at the wayside inn have,
according to gossip, been fruitful sources
of enlightenment for buds. Many a fair
debutante after a bicycle party has
emerged from her rose-colored surround
ing a sadder but wiser woman.
Much of the buds' undoing, according
to those .in a position to know,
is because of the absence of an
all-powerful leader who would give
the punch manufacture his undi
vided attention and take heed that
the bowl that supplied the brew was prop
erly sweetened and correspondingly weak.
Oakland once boasted a leader, who
sold sewing machines while he was not
dancing. His reign was brief and glori
ous. His "Frat" dropped him from its
list, the swells decided that he had a
way of appropriating that which did not
exactly belong to him and society fool
ishly concluded that it could get along
without him. Now Oakland's swellest
young man Is looking for the erstwhile
leader, hoping to fill him full of holes.
As might have been expected Oakland
Is looking in this direction to see if we,
also, have our vexed problems, and how
we may manage them.
We have troubles of our own. Only the
other day a number of dear, innocent buds
went off in a lunch party. After the

privilege of a seat at that famous table
on. the notable night when the- young
Baron distinguished himself by flinging a
champagne bottle at young Martin. We
also have our cares.
While all Oakland is gossiping at the
sad accidents that have, fallen to the lot
of the Innocent ones, a few of the more
energetic of the matrons have cpme to
conclusions that they feel certain. will put
an end to the evil. Their deductions prove
that they have carefully studied the"mat
ter, and even the lady who puts in her
plea for icewater gives substantial back
ing to support the demand.
Mrs. Thomas Magee Jr. is a leading
factor in the social world both here and
ln Oakland, and her reflections should
parry much weight. Mrs. Magee would
abolish punch at all evening parties, not
that she has ever witnessed any evil re
sults of the meeting of the bud and the
punch bowl, but on the general principle
that the young should be kept out of the
way of temptation. Says Mrs. Magee:
"I have never noticed that our young
people used the beverage freely, but I
think the safest plan would be to remove
the temptation. I think lemonade or some
cool drink is necessary when dancing, but
there are many nice drinks that contain
no alcohol. The temptation to drink freely
of any drink that will tend to cool an
overheated dancer is perhaps responsible
for some of the cases of overindulgence,
but personally I have never seen any case
of the kind."
Mrs. W. E. Sharon, with the true moth
er and chaperon instinct combined, would
look out for the young men as well as the
buds. "I think It Is a mistake to serve
punch at the dancing parties which young
people attend," says Mrs. Sharon. "I dis
approve of anything of the kind," says
the lady, "not only for the young ladies,
but for the temptation that Is thrown in
the way of our young men."
Mrs. H. K. Beldefi's views coincide with
those of Mrs. Sharon, and she also cries
out for the protection of the young danc
ing man.
Mrs. E. B. Beck in her investigation of
the subject has met young men who have
cried in vain at dancing parties for a
glass of cold water. "It is the. hardest
thing to get at some parties which I at
tend, and yet it is the most desirable,"
said the young man Mrs. Beck had In
mind. The lady wants to see the punch
bowl go. -
Mrs. T. C. Coogan wants lemonade as a
punch substitute, and so does Mrs. Wil
lard Barton. Mrs. Isaac Requa also puts
in a plea for the circus beverage, with a
special request that It be "properly pre
pared."
Mrs. H. C. Taft wants the punch bowl
banished, and Mrs. V. G. . Hush would
vary the monotony of lemonade with or
angeade. " W : -,: â -,-. .-..;
Mrs. Henry Wetherbee challenges the
caterers to prepare a new cooling drink
minus all alcoholic stimulants, and Mrs.
John R. Glascock says if lemonade Is
sticky and apt to soil white gloves that
icewater is an excellent substitute. As
for the tale, of intoxication, Mrs. Glas
cock does not believe a word of them.
"Many of our young ladies are eccentric
in their behavior," the lady declares, "and
that may account for the rumor."
up to date and recognizing the impor
tance of this movement, determined to
convince shippers that there is no need
to look further for the best and fast
est service from San Francisco to the
cities. beyond the Rockies.
The lot consisted of seven car loads
and from Denver eastward was handled
by the Burlington company, who fur
nished special freight train service and
rushed the goods through to Chicago,
a distance of 1025 miles, in thirty-five
.hours and forty-seven minutes. This
time was only three hours longer than
the regular limited vestibule train ser
vice of that company. In other words,
they did everything in their power to
encourage the shipment of goods from
the Orient via San Francisco.
What the Southern Pacific did in this
direction is another story. The tea left
this city on the morning of the 18th
inst., composing a part of one of the
regular "tri-weekly" passenger trains
of that enterprising corporation, and
finally got to Ogden before the goods
spoiled. By the economy, of axle grease,
coal, .wear and tear on the roadbed and
rolling stock, not mentioning the nerv
ous system- of the employes, Uncle Col
lis turned the cars over to the Denver
and Rio Grande Company on the 21st
inst., or about three days after their
shipment from this port. The distance
to Ogden is a little less than 800 miles.
The Denver and Rio Grande trans
ported the cars to Denver,' an equal
distance, and turned them over to the
Burlington on the afternoon of the
23d inst. 'yyy,y. _â  \
To make the Illustration plain and
comprehensive it is only necessary to
state that through the remarkable en
terprise of the Southern Pacific Com
pany the tea arrived at Denver, cover
ing a distance of about 1600 miles, in
five and a half days, and after being
taken in charge by the Burlington was
transported 1025 miles in less than
thirty-six hours.
Railroadmen are trying to figure out
where the tea would, now: be if the
Southern Pacific service had extended
to the Windy City, and how long' it
would be under such circumstances be
fore another cargo of tea would come
this way. ____________
