VANCOUVER, B. C, March
8. â Among the passengers who ;
arrived here to-day on the Em
press of India was Captain Fraser
of London, England, late of the
imperial forces. He has just j
come from Manila. He said:
"I dined with Admiral Dewey
prior to leaving for Hongkong. j
He is in poor health and certainly |
should be ordered home. I be
lieve he has aged much, and cer
tainly his hair is very white. He
is an unassuming man, and is, I
should think, a born commander.
The strain which he has under
gone and is undergoing must be j
very great. From the way in !
which the American naval com
mander speaks, he fully appre
ciates the difficulty in the way of
...
the colonization of the 1200
islands that form the great group
of the Philippines. Admiral
Dewey thinks that it will take at
least two years to subjugate the
Filipinos, for they are fighters
from 'away back,' a phrase that :
Admiral Dewey himself is said to i
hayf â partiality for."

AMERICAN SOLDIERS
SUFFER FROM HEAT
: MANILA, March B.â The temperature j
to-day at 3 o'clock was eighty-seven
degrees, but the cloudy air was like j
steam, and the troops were greatly in- j
convenienced on the line in spite of j
the temporary shade afforded by mat- j
ting and bamboos wherever feasible.
â¢There are fewer prostrations, how- I
ever, from the heat. Our troops to-day
are not compelled to remain in the open
country to the same extent as yester- j
day, when they were engaged in clear- ,
Ing the jungle. The rebels seldom ap- :
pear in the open except in the cool of
the morning and in the evening. Our
soldiers probably will feel the heat less ]
when they are on the move.

PRINCESS KAIULANI
ON HER DEATHBED
HONOLULU, March I.â Princess
Kaiulani, heir apparent to the
throne which was wrested from
Queen Liliuokalani by force of
arms, is near her death. Four
physicians in consultation at her bed
side agree that the young woman will
not live twenty-four hours. Princess
Kaiulani has been ill for some time,
but not until to-day did her indisposi
tion take a serious turn. Rheumatism
has now affected her heart, and her
hours on earth are numbered.
Princess Kaiulani _ illness dates back
to a trip made to one of the other
islands several weeks ago against the
advice of her physicians. She was
brought back sick, and since has been
confined to her room.
A strange development in connection
with the case lies in the story, only
whispered as yet, that in spite of all
precautions the poor invalid has heard
that a section of the natives are bring
ing to bear upon her in her sick condi
tion the Influence of the superstitious
rites of anaana. or praying to death, in
unrighteous revenge for her abstaining:
from interference In politics on behalf
of the ex-Queen. It is very true that
her discreet conduct in recognizing the
conditions brought by annexation has
made the Princess very unpopular with
a number of the adherents of the
Queen, much to the grave displeasure
of Liliuokalani, who has ever endeav
ored to show that their personal rela
tions were of the most friendly nature.
Kaiulani is the daughter of the late
Princess Likelike. A. S. Cleghorn, a
Scotchman, is her father. He is now
living in Honolulu. She was born Oc-
Liliuokalani, v, ho has ever endeav

[aiulani is the daughter of the late
Likelike. A. S. Cleghorn, a
>tchman, is her father. He is now
ng in Honolulu. She was born Oc
tober 16, 1875. After the death of Ka
aua, when Liliuokalani ascended the
one, Kaiulani was declared heir ap
parent to the throne of Hawaii. This
was on March 9. 1891. The Princess was
then in England pursuing her studies.
In the events that have transpired
here during the past six years, the fact
that she was being educated in Eng
; land worked against her chances of
ever being Queen. The American ele
ment here was always afraid she
would lean toward British interests as
against American. On this account, it
is safe to say, Kaiulani would not have
ascended the throne even had the mon
archy lasted. The large and wealthy
American element here has never fa
vored her claim to the throne. In 1893,
after Liliuokalani was dethroned, state
matters were in a very unsettled con

HORSE MEAT
New and Probable Theory-
Concerning the Canned
Roast "Beef."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters Wellington Hotel.
Washington* March 8.
Light seems to be breaking upon
some of the shady transactions involv
ed in the beef scandal.
There is a strong probability that
much of the canned roast "beef" to
which the troops on transports and in
the fields of Cuba and Porto Rico ob
jected was not beef at. all, but horse
meat. This is a theory constructed by
some men who have closely followed
the proceedings of the Alger relief com
mission and the beef court of inauiry.
It is a theory built on strong circum
stantial evidence.
The meat was dark red. It did not
have a "beefy" smell. The fat was
yellowish and unusual in appearance.
The meat was coarse and fibrous,
each fiber being of about the
thickness of a toothpick. It was an
ugly and unusual looking mass of
flesh.
Dr. Salmon, chief of the Bureau of
Animal Industry, said to-day that
horse meat is dark red, considerably
darker than beef. The fiber is coarse
and, as a rule, the meat is tough. The
fat is somewhat yellowish and is con-
siderably softer than beef fat.
Dr. Salmon stated that the depart
ment had official knowledge of two
horse-slaughtering establishments, and
has two applications on file at present
from men who want to establish them
selves in the horse-packing business.
hen Morton was Secretary of Agri
culture; a German started a horse
packing plant on Long Island, and
came down 'to Washington to ask Mor
ton to detail an Inspector to examine
the stock and methods of slaughter.
This was done. The proprietor bought
old horses at from $3 to $7 a head.
These were mostly animals that had
outlived their usefulness, such as con
demned car and cab horses. After
awhile the Government inspection of
this plant was withdrawn because
there was no law compelling the in
spection of horse meat.
A (lose friend to General Miles said
to-day he could prove that a horse
packing plant is in operation at Chi
cago.
Major Lee, counsel for General Miles.
who left for Chicago last night to be
present at the session of the court
there, will, on his return to Washing
ton, insist that some of the red cans be
submitted to the Department of Agri
culture for examination. While in
Chicago he will investigate the horse
slaughtering business.

KEEPS WATCH

Debate on Army Budget
Leads to the Usual Talk
of Being Prepared.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
00000000000000
NEW YORK, March- B.â A ca
ble to the World from Paris
says: A great wave of emotion
like that which swept America
after the Maine disaster is now
passing over France. It has be
come evident that the explosion
of the powder magazine at La
Goubran was the work of an en
emy. More mysterious than the
explosives found was the attack
on the sentinel there. Two shots
were fired at him as he stood on
guard. The sentry gave an
alarm and the guard was turned
out, but no prowlers were dis
covered, though the sentry says
he say six men running away.
PARIS, March B.â ln the Chamber of
Deputies to-day the debate on the army
budget led to the usual references to
the necessity for preparedness against
Germany and to comparisons of the
two armies.
The members of the house, while
complaining of the budget, which ag
gregated 875,000,000 francs, admitted the
impossibility of retrenching in the face
of the necessity of .meeting German in
creases by corresponding additions.
The Minister of War, M. de Frey
clnet, admitted that the French effect
ive force was inferior to the German,
but he pointed out that it was impos
sible to remedy, this, owing to the lack
of population.
The Minister also expressed the belief
that mere numbers above a certain
point did not add to the effectiveness
of the army, as the excess beyond that
point could only act as reserves, and
he was convinced that the fate of a
conflict would be decided before the
reserves could be employed. It is not
necessary, therefore, the Minister said,
to be alarmed about neighboring in
creases. France must meet quantity
by quality. The rifles and guns of the
French army were without their equals,
and the country, therefore, might await
the future with confidence.

FLESH OF A
LIVING MAN
Horrible Torture of a Priest
by Fanatical Natives
in China.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
VICTORIA. B. C, March Particu
lars of the murder and horrible mutila
tion of Rev. Father Victorien, a Catho
lic missionary at Hwel-Fei, were re
ceived by her Majesty's ship Empress
of India. For some time previous to
the tragedy .there had been a feeling
of enmity against the Catholics among
the evilly disposed and this at last came
to a head In an attack on the Catholic
converts at Shihkushan. Father Vic
torien at first made his escape, but was
so unfortunate as to be caught by a
roving band of rioters, who, after beat
ing him cruelly and stripping him al
most naked, tied him on a board and
brought him in triumph back to his
former home. There a large band of
rioters was assembled whose evil pas
sions had been stirred by the slaughter
ing of converts in which they had been
indulging.
"In sight of his late home," writes
correspondent, "they tied the poor
priest to a tree â and here I would glad
ly draw a veil over the rest of this
ghastly scene, but that I feel that the
world should know of what the Chinese,
in their hour of triumph over a defense
less foreigner, are capable, and I would
warn all' readers who are inclined to be
squeamish to read no further or to skip
the next few lines.
"As this poor man hung from the
tree to. which he was tied pieces were
cut from. his thighs and eaten by his
tormentors. Fire was evidently applied
to his body and slugs were fired into
non-vital parts. Finally, before life
was extinct, his body was cut open
from the chest to the bottom of the
abdomen, he was disemboweled and the
various organs were taken out and
eaten by these semi-civilized people,
who at the same time drank his blood.
He was otherwise mutilated and his
head cut off. One eye evidently was
gouged out.
"Now, first, as to how these particu
lars are known. The remains tell their
own tale to begin with, and I have seen,
to my sorrow, the state of things that
would manifestly result from such
treatment as I have described. In ad
dition to this, details are gradually
leaking out through native eye-wit
nesses, who are not in any way con
nected with the mission and have abso
lutely nothing to gain by exaggera
tion."
The doctor who examined the remains
upon their arrival at Ichang writes:
"I have to-day seen a sad and pitiful
sight which I -wish I could bring home
to some of those benighted statesmen
who will fatuously insist on regarding
and treating this nation of China as a
civilized or even semi-civilized people.
What I sawâ and the horror will re
main with me for many a long day
was all that -was. left of what but little
more than a month ago was a fine, en
thusiastic young . Roman Catholic
priest, who came out some eighteen
months ago to bring light and religion
to a people who have done him to death
in a manner ' that , could â¢ not be , sur

LONDON. March B.â Lord Charles
Bere'sford landed this afternoon at
Southampton on the American liner St.
Louis after six months' hard work as
the British empire's commercial trav

The gallant admiral said he felt all
right and fit for anything.
â¢When asked to give his opinion on
the future of China trade, the feeling
in the United States on the matter and
-figure relations of Great Britain and
the United States Lord Beresford said:
. "There is only one thing to do, and
that is to maintain a policy of open
door. If we don't have that policy
and if we go in for spheres of influence
we shall drift into war. Spheres of in
fluence means every country grabbing
something, and if all the powers begin
grabbing land in China they are bound
to quarrel and war will be the result.
I am convinced that we can keep China
on her feet if we do not go in for a
policy of every nation grasping terri
tory for itself.
"The thing for Japan, Germany, the
United States and Great Britain to do
is to agree in maintaining the open
door policy, insisting that no ports shall
be closed against their ships of trade.
So far as trade is concerned Great Brit
ain is a predominant partner in China.
We must keep ports open if we are to
keep our trade. As for competition,
America is gcing ahead with leaps and
bounds, faster than we are, but at
present we have more trade than every
body else. The trade of China last year
was worth Â£55,000,000, of which 55
per cent was with British traders.
"While in America I endeavored to
show that with her growing trade she
is as much interested as England, Ger
many and Japan in securing unrestrict
ed trade with China. Of course I do not
suggest a cut-and-dried alliance be
tween these powers or between us and
; America, I don't think it necessary, and
! I don't suggest for a moment that
America would join an alliance of that
kind, but I think we might agree, work
ing together, to maintain an open door."
Lord Charles Beresford expressed his
appreciation of the kind treatment
which he had received in America and
paid a glowing tribute to the business
activity and industry of the country.
He stated positively his mission was
purely commercial and not political.

DISGRACEFUL SCENE
BETWEEN LOBBYISTS
AND ASSEMBLYMEN
Decent Element of the House Stirred
to Open Rebellion.
VIOLENCE OFFERED THE SPEAKER
.'-'"yy '
Major McLaughlin Gets Himself So Greatly Disliked
That He Retires From the Floor to Save
Himself From Chastisement.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March B.â To-day Major
Frank McLaughlin, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee,
was the central figure in a scene on the
floor of the Assembly that has few
parallels in all the infamous .side of
legislative history.
Ignoring every rule laid down by the
House, every dictate of decency and
honorable procedure, he injected his
presence into the regular business of
the day, and in attempting to make
further Senatorial capital out of the
episode in which Milton J. Green,
Grant's political manager, was the
prime factor, stirred the decent ele
| ment in the House to the point of open
rebellion, and himself escaped being
ignominiously thrashed by two of the
: sturdiest members of the Grant faction
by taking a tin offered by Grove L.
Johnson and retiring from the open
floor to a corner behind the railing in
the hack of the chamber.
Never in all the long, unlovely story
that" can be told of California's Legis
latures was such a scene as to-day's.
From corner to corner and from one
side to thÂ« other men bandied epithets,
jeered and cried out to know by what
right the outsiders should come among
them, whip in hand, to demand that
they do the bidding of Burns. .
From their seats members criticized,
howled at and jeered their Speaker,
who, with uplifted gavel and flaming
face demanded above the roar that
they maintain some small semblance of
order.
To and fro across the chamber raced
the members of the different steering
committees bracing up a man here,
concentrating a half dozen there, where
they would best serve their purpose, and
at all times combating McLaughlin and
the gang of touts that had bobbed up
on the floor when the alarm was seDt
out through the corridors.
In the anger and hot blood of the mo
ment everything was forgotten by the
anti-Burns factions save that in his
desperation the Mexican had invaded
their very privileges, sacredly exclusive
to them by the law itself, in an attempt
to force them to coin, his Senatorial
capital for him.
For a moment it was forgotten that
the main question was whether or no
Milton J. Green should be relieved of
the charge of contempt that is upon
him. and every energy was bent to de
feating and rendering of no effect the
onslaught that McLaughlin, aided by
Johnson and Dibble, had made upon the
very honor of the House itself.
Upon the first test made they were
victorious, hut upon the second the
Mexican forces prevailed, though in
winning they destroyed their last ves
tige of a chance of success. Between
them and the Grant forces, whom they
fought to win over, they builded up a
barrier which it will take longer to
surmount than the few remaining days
of the session.
At the first sign of danger only the
Burns forces rallied. The others in the
House considered the case against Mil
ton Green too dead an issue to ever
again prove a casus belli between the
warring Senatorial factions and to-day
they expected nothing more than the
usual certificate from the attending
physician. 'â ..'..
And in truth it did not seem at first
that there was. A letter from Walter
Bacon, Grant's other manager, to As
semblyman Crowder, was read and it
explained to the House that Mr. Green's
wife was so seriously ill as to preclude
any possibility of his appearance. In
the same old way Grove Johnson got up
to move further time for the accused.
He said he knew of Mrs. Green's ill
ness and said also that many of the
members knew also of the sad death
of the new-born baby. The excuse, he
said, was sufficient.
Then came Fairweather with an
amendment, which was in effect that
the charge of contempt be dismissed.
Then the speaking began.
Burnett, one of the committee whose
questions Green refused to answer,
spoke with considerable heat against it.
He said that Mr. Green's family mis
fortunes were lamentable, but they had
nothing to do with the case In hand.
He would reluctantly agree to a con
tinuance, under the circumstances, but
would not consent to dismissal.
Belshaw of Contra Costa said: "If
we adopt the amendment we declare to
the world that we did not mean it; that
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
all this talk of ours over Green's con
tempt has been a joke and a josh. It
would virtually say we did not know
what we were talking about."
Then Lardner, who seconded the
amendment, came to Green's defense:
"I was a member of the. Investigating
committee, and at first I was as earnest
as any of you that Mr. Green be
brought to book for his contempt. But
by the unfortunate circumstances that
have resulted from all this trouble Mil
ton Green has been sufficiently pun
ished."
"This weekly farce!" shouted Cami
netti, "is a shame to this House, and I
shall certainly vote for this amend
ment!"
Then Judge Clough of Plumas made
the speech that carried Fairweather's
amendment on the first ballot. "Gen
tlemen," said he, "this man's punish
ment has been enough. Even if you do
not agree with me in that you will in
the fact that nothing has been gained
in continuing from week to week the
charges aganist him. Each week there
have been interpositions of Providence
or something else to prevent his appear
ance here. First it was his sickness,
then his wife's, and now. saddest of
all, the death of their new-born babe.
I have the emotions and feelings that
move all men â you have them and I
for one will not vote to bring him here
at, such a time as this. I am for the
amendment."
Then Valentine fo Los Angeles said
he had as much as any. man of the milk
of human kindness in his breast, but
he did not second any move to lift the
charges from Milton Green. "It Would
vindicate Green and write the Assem
bly down a lot of fools who do not
know their own minds,"
Then it came Johnson's and Dibble's
time to tip the future play off to the
Burns gang. Johson said he hoped the
amendment would not carry. It was
not a question of sympathy, he said,
but a question of vindicating the
course of the Assembly.
"It is just this," chorused Dib
ble. "Shall we or shall we not disgrace
this House?"
"All those in favor of the amendment
signify by saying aye," said Speaker
Anderson, and after the chorus went
up he declared the "nays" had it.
A yell of disapproval went up, and a
rollcall was demanded and ordered.
The Burns people thought they would
have no trouble in beating it out, but
before the call was half finished little
Jake Steppacher shot out into the cor
ridors to sound the alarm and round
up McLaughlin. Assemblyman Barry
of San Francisco got off wrong, voting
"aye," and started to leave the cham
ber, but Johnson sent the sergeant at
arms after him with orders to come
back and change to "no." Mike came
back.
The roll call won by a' score of 36 to
35. Before Speaker Anderson announced
the vote Johnson and Dibble demanded
a call, of the House. Although the
amendment had won they still demand
ed a chance to beat it and took advant
age of the Speaker's hesitancy to get
it. The call was ordered after a row
over roll call and the doors were closed
almost on the coattails of McLaughlin,
who came in, breathless, with Jake
Steppacher closely following.
Bliss, Cr.owly, Greenwell, Hanley,
Kelley, Kenneally, Robinson and Works
were absent. There were just seventy
two members present and while the roll
was being called and recalled Mc-
Laughlin strode on the floor and to
Johnson's seat. V_V:
He talked a while with Grovel, and
Grove got into rapid action among the
members. Then Lardner of Placer
opened the ball against McLaughlin.
He jumped to his feet, and, indicating
the major, demanded to know if there
was not a rule of the House that no
outsiders be allowed to lobby on the
floor. His hint was well backed up by
a shout of approval from the Barnes
and Grant ranks and McLaughlin
gracefully retired behind the railing,
only to return to begin operations in
another quarter. Back and forth he
went, and each minute the anti-Burns
element grew warmer. McDonald of
Alameda and Blood of Calaveras stood
ready -to administer a thrashing if he
persisted, and finally yielding to the
overwhelming sentiment against him
he retired from the floor.
Crowder moved that further pro
ceedings under the call of the House be
dispensed with, but the Speaker ignored

ANOTHER OF BURNS
PET MEASURES GETS
A KNOCKOUT BLOW
Dickinson's Harbor Commission Bill Laid to
Rest.
ONLY NINE VOTES CAST IN ITS FAVOR
A Majority of the Republican Members of the Senate
Could Not Be Whipped Into Line by the Lobby
ists of the Mexican.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March S.â Dickinson's bill to
provide for the reorganization of -the
Harbor Commission of San Francisco
has been laid to rest.
It was refused passage by a vote of
26 against 3 in its favor, and among
its strongest opponents were a ma
jority of the Republican members of
the Senate. The fight was as bitter
a one as the Senate generally allows
itself to indulge in, and while the result
showed no party line, yet in the debate
it was sharply drawn. It resulted in
a combination between the Grant men
and others and the Democrats in what
looked like a manifesto to the Gov
ernor that he would get no more pa
tronage to use in the Interest of the
Senatorial aspirations of the man from
Mexico.
It was as severe a defeat for Burns |
as was the vote on the poolselling bill j
taken yesterday, and it was not made i
lighter by the fact that among the op- j
ponents of the bill were two of his own I
men. Lobbying did no good and only
served to make the fight more bitter,
and on the question of patronage .he j
measure was fought and lost. In the j
debate, after it had been fairly started, '
there was no attempt made to conceal :
the real intent of the bill, and finally
when Shortridge announced that ail the
bill meant to him was the removal of
Budd from the attorneyship it was so
'evident he had hit the purpose of the
measure that the Senate and lobby
joined in the laugh that went up.
When all the oratory had been ex
hausted the supporters began to hedge.
They had not expected so fierce and de
termined an opposition, and so Mere
house moved to postpone action on the
bill until Friday.
. Leavitt was quick to see the way the
wind was blowing, and he rose to say
â¢he would like to take some more time
'to consider the measure before he
voted .upon it, an anxiety for informa- i
tion that met some derision. j
Morehouse insisted on his motion on
the ground that there was no need to
hurry the matter, and besides he would
like a full House present to consider
the bill. There was at the time thirty
five out of the thirty-nine Senators
present, a number seldom exceeded in
any of the sessions, but Morehouse
thought there ought to be more and
repeated his motion,
Davis suggested if that was all he
wished the bill to go over for he might
just as well let it go to a vote, and
should it be defeated he could move for
a reconsideration, but that was not
what Morehouse wanted. But his mo
tion delayed matters only a few min
utes, and then the bill was forced to a
vote and to defeat.
Dickinson was the first to speak on
the measure. He declared the bill was
not formed for political reasons nor on
political lines and he pointed to that
section which continues in office the two
Democrats whose terms have not ex
pired in support of his statement. He
said when an institution collects and
pays out over $60,000 a month it should
be put in a position to do so with no loss
to the State and no injury to the busi
ness of the harbor and he thought the
present commission had shown it was
incapable or unwilling to properly per
form its duties. He referred to the
message of Governor Budd in which he
recommended an increase in the com
mission and he said that to provide for
the better handling or the business it
was deemed better to add two more to
the governing body.
Coming back to the work of the pres
ent commission, he referred to the pur
chasing department that requires an
expenditure of $9000 in the purchase of
goods to the value of $22,000; to the har
bor police, which he said were useless,
and had been so characterized by one
of the members of the commission re
sponsible for them; he referred, too, to
the watchmen, who, he said, were also
of no use, for every vessel had its own
watchmen. He charged that the pres
ent commissioners were doing nothing
toward cutting down expenses and were
letting harbor affairs drift as they had
been drifting in the same old expensive
â¢way for years. Could the bill only be
passed he saw a vision of retrenchment
and reform; of officials all of whom had
duties enough to keep them busy, of
useless employes hunting for other jobs,
and everything running like a well
made watch.
Boyce took a different view of the
case and declared himself as opposed
to the bill. He said the conditions of
harbor affairs in San Francisco was
enough to put every decent citizen to
the blush, hut Dickinson's bill was not
the remedy. It would be no relief, he
said, to add two more to the hungry
leaders who had already made the in
stitution a shame; would only make
matters worse than they are, and he
was opposed to the bill, for he knew
there were other and better methods
of correcting the evils that exist.
When It came to Morehouse he made
a regular old-fashioned, cheer-inspiring
campaign speech to which no one is
ever expected to listen unless he be of
the same political faith as the speaker
and which is a matter of course when
ever a machine candidate gets up to
speak to the boys. "To the victors be
long the spoils" was his text and in
expounding it he rapped civil service
and toleration in politics as hard as his
verbal club would allow. He was in
favor of the bill, he said, and if he had
his way he would turn out every Demo
crat in the harbor service as soon as it
was put in force. : yyyy-
They had done it to the Republicans,
he cried, and the Republicans should
do it to them. "I want; to see the
political patronage of this State when
the State Is under a Republican admin
istration in the hands of Republicans."
the excited Senator ejaculated, "and
then when the Democrats get control
let them Are us." --; v :
' As no one had said anything about
political patronage and Dickinson had
been careful to keep his argument-' In
favor of the bill down to the manage
ment of the present commission. More
house's remarks ; were a trifle irrele
vant, but then every one knew where
the little black man had climbed
i
through the fence, and It did no harm
to let Morehouse have his fling.
But Davis had a hot package to hand
to the Senate, and as soon as More
house had run down he proceeded to
pass it out. He was in favor of civil
service, he said, and for any one to de
clare against it as had the Senator
from San Jose (meaning Morehouse)
was to declare all the civil service
planks in the Republican party for
years to be but living lies. "No man
shall crack a whip over the heads of
the men of the Republican party," he
cried, "and $ay to them 'go back to the
spoils system which you have aban
doned.' We will not go back to it. The
party does not want it and there do
not live better Republicans than those
here on the floor of this Senate who
are going to vote against this bill. We
are not here to advocate the spoils sys
tem and this is the first time I have
heard such a "sentiment as has just
been expressed so openly flung into our
faces.
"We' are here to rise above politics.
In this matter the only thing we
should ask ourselves is, '"What is the
right thing to do?' and it is not to add
to an institution which you already de
scribe as iniquitious. There is no use
in raising this commission to five
members. It is good enough or bad
enough as it is. It should not be made j
the excuse for going back again to the
old spoils system. Do not pull down the
flag of clean politics and vote against
this bill."
Then Wolfe had his say, and in
starting out he declared that all he I
had heard was rot, pure and simple, j
which was an easy way of answering i
SPIELER HERRIN : "Here y'are. Don't Be Afraid. The Kind Gentleman Inside Won't Do a Thing to You."

it. but not quite to the point. He pro- |
ceeded, however, to pick up Davis' j
speech for his allotted time, and in
closing declared the bill was a measure
to put the water front of San Fran
cisco on a business basis. It could not
be done with less than five commission
ers, he was sure.
Then it was Shortridge's turn, and to
the delight of those who knew but did
not like to say so, he laid bare the j
scheme by pointing 'out what the bill j
meant to him. "It means getting Jim j
Budd out of office; that's what it means i
to me," he shouted in the glee of hie
discovery of the great truth, and he j
joined in the laugh his outburst brought :
from his auditors.
Dickinson wound up matters with
another explanation of what the bill
would do, and then the orators ceased.
It looked bad for the bill. So bad. in
fact, that the motive of Morehouse's j
motion to postpone final action was ;
very apparent. His motion went to de- i
feat by this vote:
Ayesâ Bulla, Flint, Leavitt. More
house, Shortridge, Taylor, Wolfeâ 7.
Noesâ Ashe, Bettman, Boyce, Braun
hart, Burnett, Chapman, Curtin, Cut- j
ter, Davis, Dickinson, Doty, Dwyer,
Feeney, Hall, Hoey, Jones, Laird. La
Rue, Luchsinger, Magga-rd. Nutt, Prisk,
Rowell, Sims, Smith, Troutâ 26.
There was no more talk. The j
rollcall on the bill was demanded, and j
without more ado the bill was laid in
the grave that had been dug for It. The
vote was as follows:
Ayesâ Rett man, Bulla, Flint. Laird,
Leavitt, Morehouse, Shortridge, Tay
lor, Wolfe- -9.
Noesâ Boyce, Braunhart, Bur
nett, Chapman, Curtln, Cutter. Davis,
Dickinson, Doty, Dwyer, Feeney, Hall,

gard. Nutt, Pace, Prisk, Rowell, Sims,
Smith, Troutâ 2s.
Absentâ Currier, Gillette, Langford,
Simpson â 4. ; â '/:."â 
Senator Dickinson changed his vote
from aye to no before the result was
announced and then gave notice of a
motion to reconsider the vote.
Stratton was excused from voting, on
motion of Davis, because he was an at
torney of the commission in its recent
litigation and has now a claim against
it for services rendered.
It will be noticed that in the votes
against the bill are those of Boyce. J
Cutter, Jones, Maggard, Nutt. Smith
and Trout, all Grant men. and Davis
and Rowell, Scott men. It will also be
noted with Interest that Burnett and
Hoey, two Burns men, are among the
opponents of the measure.
To Maintain Jurisdiction.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March B.â Assemblyman Cami
netti this morning brought in a minority
report from the Judiciary Committee on
Senator Simpson's Santa Fe Railroad bill.
The report contained a substitute, bill,
drafted by Caminetti, which he claims
will extend the same privileges as Simp
son's bill to the Santa Fe, but precludes
a possibility of the Southern Pacific prof
iting by it. Caminetti claims that Simp
sons' bill puts franchises transferred to
the Santa Fe beyond the jurisdiction of
the State Railroad Commissioners, and
his substitute is designed to countenance
the transfers, but maintain the jurisdic
tion. * '

Johnson made no capital .of his

went right along .as it has been

his last batch into camp.
There were some, however,

! Alameda approached the desk and
shaking his fist up at the Speaker ap
pealed from his decision. Anderson
said the vote was announced and there
was no appeal. Then Brown criticized
the Speaker and Dibble attempted to
call him down. He was jeered for his
pains.
Caminetti tried the same motion, hut
it resulted in only more jeers. The
Burns crowd sneered and the Grant
people were ready to fight. Brown re
newed his motion and also his criti
cism, but neither resulted in anything
save more bad feeling and jeering.
Boone (D.), was brought in and
voted with the noes and Cosper got
up and said the members of the com
mittee had all talked with him. which
the members had not all done, and in
deference to them he would change
from "aye" to "no." He was shut
out by the angry Grant faction and
compelled to wait until, on motion of
Johnson, the call was* dispensed with,
to make his talk.
Then Brown changed from no to aye
and O'Brien, who had not previously
voted, voted no. Wade of Napa
changed from aye to no, and Brooke of
Sacramento did the same thing, and the
vote wound up 37 to 34 against the
amendment. 'y '.'-,
The Grant and Barnes people did not.
vote solidly in Green's favor. A num

him vindicated without a hearing, and
their votes were cast conscientiously
to that end and not because they

A SETBACK FOR
THE SEAWALL BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March B.â The San Francisco
seawall bill has had another setback. By
a mistake of the printer the amendment
which provided for the continuance of the
seawall both to the southward and to the
northward, changing the original bill to
include the buildinp of the wall north of
the portion already completed, was left
out. When the bill was introduced by
Braunhart in the Senate considerable op
position was made to it because it did not
provide for the seawall being built to the
north, instead of only to the south, and
the bill was amended so as to meet the
objections made.
In consequence when the mistake was
discovered it created somewhat of a stir
among certain members of the Assembly,
before which the bill was considered this
evening. An amendment was, however,
introduced by Assemblyman Dibble,
which set matters aright, and the bill
was recommitted to the conference com
mittee and will again have to go to the
printer, which will necessarily cause de
lay. -

FIGHTING MAJOR
McLAUGHLIN HAS
HIS NOSE TWEAKED
Suffers an Indignity at the Hands
of an Irate Newspaper
Man.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March B.â Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin objects to the tone that has
I been taken by the Los Angeles Times in
its criticism of his acts in connection
with the Senatorial campaign of Dan
Burns. As one definite result of his
feeling in this matter he had a per
sonal encounter to-night with C. E.
Washburn, legislative correspondent
of the Times.
The encounter occurred in the hall
way on the second floor of the Golden
Eagle Hotel, and for about a minute
the combatants provided entertain
ment for a small but select audience.
Washburn had just reached the toD of
the stairs on his way to the head
quarters of Ulysses S. Grant when
some one addressed him. Turning
about he saw McLaughlin standing
near and asked if it were he who
spoke. The major replied that it was.
"What did you say?" asked Wash
burn.
"I said you were a tub of â â ."
"Then you are a ."
retorted Washburn.
For reply to this the major led with
his right and landed lightly on Wash
burn's jaw. He then reached for his
handkerchief or something else in his
hip pocket, but changed his mind and
received a left hook from Washburn
instead. The major countered neatly
but ineffectually, and Washburn broke
the rules of ring events by tweaking
McLaughlin's nose.
Both men indulged in some lively In
fighting, the net result of which was
slight damage to the Washburn coun
tenance caused by a large diamond
worn by the major on his right hand.
The contest of skill and endurance was
becoming interesting, but at this point
i one of the major's friends caught
Washburn about the neck and pulled
| them apart.
Washburn broke away from the man
\ who held him, but when he glanced
about him and saw that the major was
j backed by half a dozen or more friends,
he concluded that he was in the camp
of the enemy and stood no show of suc
cess even did he put the bulky major
out in the next round. It was at this
point that the really serious aspect of
the case became apparent.
"You've got your friends about you
and I am alone," said Washburn.
"Wait until I get my friends and I'll
fight you to a finish."
With that he rushed into the Grant
headquarters and summoned help.
The contest that had occurred earlier
in the day in the Assembly chamber on
account of the Milton J. Green con
tempt proceedings had stirred up a
very bitter feeling between the mem
bers of the Grant and Burns factions.
On the part of the Grant men' this feel
ing was particularly bitter toward Mc-
Laughlin, who had lobbied against the
Green resolution on the floor of the As-
sembly.
Had Washburn found any of the
Grant supporters in Mr. Grant's head
quarters a general free-for-all fight
would have been the result. As it was
he found the quarters vacant, and so
hostilities -were suspended for the time
being.
The fight has intensified the feeling
between Grant's supporters and Mc-
Laughlin and the balance of the Burns
following and a clash is momentarily
expected. _________^__ â __

SAVES THE LIFE
OF PETER CASTRO
The Alleged Assailant of Mrs.
Douglass Barely Escapes
Lynching,
SALINAS. March B.â a ruse prac
ticed by Sheriff Farley Peter Castro
owes his escape from death at the
hands of infuriated citizens of Castro
vllie. The man accused of complicity
in the brutal attack upon Mrs. James
L. Douglass was captured near Pajaro
last night by the Sheriff's posse after a
weary pursuit through marsh and
brush and along the railroad line. Soon
after the capture Douglass, who was at
the head of a party of citizens intent
on lynching the suspect, rode into Cas
troville. Castro saw the party ap
proach and Implored the officers to save
him from death. The Sheriff managed
to elude the husband and hurried his
prisoner away in a carriage in company
with only one other officer, bringing
him to the Jail in this city. Had Sheriff
Farley lest any time it is probable the
posse under Douglass would have taken
Castro from him and hanged him.
After his escape from the vengeance
of Douglass in Castrovllle on the day
following the crime Castro tried to bor
row a horse from P. Collins, a rancher
near the town. He gave as his excuse
for being out of breath that he had
got into trouble and wanted to go to
Salinas and give himself up. Collins
was unaware of the tragedy of the
night before, but refused to loan the
animal. Then Castro set off afoot
toward the hills. The Sheriff tracked
the man through sloughs and at times
mired in them. The trail was lost when
near Pajaro and the posse separated,
some going to Watsonvllle while others
were stationed at the county roads near
Pajaro.
Night came on and it was feared the
man would escape on a freight train,
he being an expert brakebeam Jumper.
The train arrived at the depot and had
been at the station but ten or fifteen
minutes when Sheriff Farley observed
a man approaching on the dark side
opposite the depot. He hailed him and
the fellow asked him what he wanted.
Farley asked the fellow where he was
going and he replied, "To Watson
ville." He said he was working near
by and gave his name as George Stew

WHO WROTE THE
ALLEGED WILL?
Fuller Mystery Deepens
at Chico.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OROVILLE, March B.â The news,
printed exclusively in yesterday's Call, j
that a contest Is about to be filed in the i
Fuller will case revived interest in the
matter here and at Chico. While every
body expected the heirs of Alfred Ful
ler would exhaust every effort to "obtain
the property which they claim is right
fully theirs, the announcement that the
â will was to be disputed as an alleged
forgery" created a great sensation and
the people of Chico and vicinity are
now talking of nothing else. The mys
tery attending the sudden appearance
of the alleged will of the old capitalist
has been before the Grand Jury for
some time and now the new phase â
the charge of forgery-^undoubtedly
will be taken up when the contestants'
petition is Bled.
It is not known here who is to be
charged with having committed the fel
ony and many wild rumors are afloat.
The lawyers familiar with the case will
not enlighten the anxious public until
they have made every preparation to
substantiate their allegations. Many
persons who attended the proceedings
when the alleged Fuller will was ad
mitted to probate are now recalling the
testimony given by Dr. Rodley, J. M.
Garner, H. Cormack and Mrs. Minnie
Houseworth.
Mrs. Houseworth said she was in
Chico a few months before Fuller died
and met him on the street. He told her
he wanted to see her privately and she
made an appointment to meet him in
the park. According to her story they
went to the park by different routes so
no one would see hem together. She
met Fuller and he broached the sub
ject of his will. This was in September.
Fuller told her he had made a 'will,
leaving to her all his property, but he
refused to give the document to her
or to tell her to whom he had entrusted
it. She asked him for the will and he
replied he had put it into a good man's
hands and it would bo delivered to her
' immediately after his death, should his
! demise" precede hers.
Mr.-. Houseworth further testified
that she met Fuller about a month be
fore his death and that he said to her:
"Minnie, I have done all for you that
a man can do for the woman he loves.
I have left you everything I have."
He again refused to give her' the will
or inform her who had it. .
Mrs. -worth was away from
Chico when Alfred Fuller died, but she
returned soon afterward and asked all
of Fuller's old friends if he had left his
will with them. The will was not found
until It mysteriously reached Mr. Cor
mack a year after Fuller's death.
Garner, the second witness to the al
leged will, told in court how he came
to attach his signature to the paper.
He went to Dr. Rudley's office to get
some medicine for a man who was sick
at his ranch and while there was asked
by the doctor and also by Fuller to wit
ness the document and say nothing
about It.
Dr. Rodley's testimony was on the
same line, and he went into minute de
tails of the incident and the conversa
tion he had with Fuller before Garner
came in. Fuller, so the doctor said, was
afraid to trust any one with the know
edge that he had made a will and could
not decide upon the second witness.
Garner came in "and as Fuller had con
fidence in him he signed the testament.
Now the all-absorbing question is:
Who will be accused of having written
the will? The public is also on the gui
vive to learn if the reputation of Dr.
Rodley and John Garner will be in any
way reflected upon when the Fuller
heirs file their contest.

MINERS FLOCK TO
REPUBLIC CAMP
SPOKANE, Wash.. March B.â The richest gold ore yet found In Re
public Camp on the Colville Reservation was uncovered in the Flasrhlll
claim to-day. Telluride ore was encountered in the shaft at a depth
of twenty feet which assays $15,957 to the ton.
The camp Is greatly excited. Three stages come Into the camp
daily, laden to the guards, and large numbers of miners are going in by
private conveyance and on horseback. Experienced mining men pre
dict the camp will have 5000 people before midsummer and 10,000 by the
end of the year.
A sensational strike of, sold ore has been made in the Bunker Hill
mine, on Palmer Mountain, in Okanogan County. This claim was
owned by "Pinnacle Jimmy." who bonded it to the British-American
Corporation of London. That company threw up the bond and Patrick
Clark of this city, president of the Republic Company, immediately
took a bond and started experienced miners to work. The face of the
tunnel is now in remarkably rich ore and from sixty pounds of rock
taken from the waste dump and pounded out ln a hand mortar four
teen ounces of gold was taken.
OUR STRATEGY
WAS HAZARDOUS
Colomb's Lecture on
War Lessons.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March B.â Vice Admiral
Philip Howard Colomb, retired, lectured
this evening on the lessons of the Span
ish-American war before the members
of the United Service Institute.
After dealing with the impossibility
of secrecy in warfare hereafter, owing
to the vigilance of the press and the
necessity for protecting cables in shal
low water, he said he thought, that if
Spain had showed real comprehension
of strategy the United States would not
have been so successful. The sure way |
for the United States would have been j
for her to send a sufficient force to the j
coast of Spain to balance the forces i
known to have been in Spanish ports
and to send a squadron to the Cape
Verde Islands the moment ft was
known a Spanish flotilla was assem
bling there. If, he added, the island of
Minorca had been seized as a base j
nothing offensive on the other side of :
the Atlantic would have been attempted |
by Spain. â¢-. V :v; .:;.,
The lesson to be deduced was, ac
cording to the lecturer, that the Amer
ican strategy was hazardous, in so far
as it departed from the stereotyped
rules of naval warfare. Admiral Cer
vera's ships were lost sight of, causing
anxiety on the American coasts and
obliging the Americans to keep consid
erable squadrons wholly in a defensive
attitude Instead of maintaining com
mand of the sea.
It was clear, he added, that if there
had been coal supplies at Santiago de
Cuba, and if Admiral Cervera's squad
ron had been reasonably efficient, in
stead of a "miserable abortion," all it
could have purposed to effect by enter
ing Santiago might have been effected
without any interference on the part of
the United States navy.
From actions between the Spanish
forts and American ships, the speaker
deduced the idea that very inefficient
batteries were able to keep ships at a
distance. /VV-
Regarding the purely tactical ques
tions involved the admiral said it was
plain Admiral Dewey took advantage
of the superiority of his guns and gun
ners and placed himself in so distant a
position that neither the Spanish ships
nor the Spanish batteries were able to
adequately reply to his fire. The whole
thing, continued the lecturer, was tre
ribly business-like on the American
side, with a pathetic parade of quixotic
gallantry on the other.
In conclusion, Admiral Colomb com
mented on the fact that all orders to
the American ships were sent from
Washington, which he considered a
momentous change in naval warfare.

CHAMPION DIVERS
PLUNGE TO DEATH
Thomas Donaldson
, tally Injured.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ© Call.
NEW YORK, March B.â Thomas Don
aldson of Bath Beach, L. 1., known the.
world over as a champion high diver,
dove from the roof of Madison-square
Garden, a distance- of 85 feet, this after
noon with probably fatal results.
Donaldson traveled for some years
with Barnum & Bailey's circus and has
been the star attraction at the sports
man's show now running in the garden.
He has been making two dives dally.
The tank is less than eight feet deep
and on two or three former occasions
Donaldson did not have the success ex
pected, and came out of the water with
hemorrhages from the nose and ears.
Harry Cornish has charge of the
water sports and it was he who this
afternoon gave Donaldson the signal
to dive. Three thousand people were
present and saw the famous diver lean
from the platform and, falling slowly
forward, make the plunge. He shot
straight downward, but it was plain
before he got half the distance that he
had lost control of his body. He struck
the water head first and failed to come
up. Small circles of blood came bub
bling up from the bottom, and Harry
Reeder, the amateur champion swim
mer, and an attache of the garden
plunged into the water. The men dived
several times and finally Reeder
brought Donaldson to the surface. He
was apparently dead, with blood flow
ing from mouth, nostrils and ears and
from wounds on the head.
Donaldson was carried to one of the
t dressing rooms and attended by several
physicians. He was then removed to
the New York Hospital. He has a frac
tured skull with compression of the
brain and the left side of his face is
crushed in. The surgeons at the hos
pital say that his death is a question of
hours.
Witnesses of the accident say that
as Donaldson left the platform the col
ors which were wrapped about him be
came loose. His attention was diverted
and he did not have his wits about him
when he struck the water. He weighed
more than 200 pounds and struck with
terrific force. Donaldson was 45 years
of age.

SIX DIRECTORS
HAVE RESIGNED
Court in Charge of the
Union Bank.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March B.â The manage
ment of the Union Savings Bank is now
in the hands of Judge Lorigan of the
Superior Court, who this afternoon re
ceived the resignations of six directors.
The matter came upon the filing of a
supplemental complaint by Attorney
General Ford to the suit brought to
: have the bank declared insolvent. The
supplemental petition recited that all
seven directors had resigned, and the
court was asked to fill the vacancies.
j This was a mistake, however, for Di
rector Charles P. Braslan refused to
; resign. An answer was filed by the
directors stating this fact. Those re
signing were: W. H. Wright, N. Bow
den.-A.masa Eaton, Cyrus Jones, J. W.
Rea and L. Callisch. Francis Pope and
; L. B. Archer filed notice of appearance
as attorneys for the several depositors.
The directors' answer stated that at
! a meeting the stockholders had said
they would be satisfied with four places
I on the board chosen to close the bank's
j affairs. This left Wright and Bowden
1 of the old directors on the board. Pope
object__ to these men being reappointed
i by the court and also was In favor of
I ousting Braslan, who had been elected
;to the directorate since the failure.
! Pope was starting in on a long har
: angue about the directors overdrawing
their accounts when Judge Lorigan in
: terrupted him. He then asked till to
morrow to file a protest against the re
; appointing of any of the old board.
Deputy Attorney Sturtevant objected to
delay, and the court sided with him.
Judge Lorigan said he would appoint
a board of directors on Friday morning,
and asked if any names were to be sug
gested. S. A. Barker suggested a list
, of fifteen names and S. G. Tompkins
\ seven. Cashier Friant submitted the
: entire list of stockholders of the bank.
, The court will appoint- seven and let.
the directors settle whether Braslan'
shall resign or not. The latter abso-
I lutely refuses to resign and the case
: will have to be* fought out in court.
The depositors held a meeting at
j Hale's Hall this afternoon. It was de
j cided not to ask for representation on
I the board of directors. They are be
coming uneasy at the continual delay
in the settlement of the bank's affairs,
and unless matters go ahead more rap
idly will commence suit. A committee
consisting of Louis Argues, F. F. Brit
ton, B. G. Hurlburt, C. W. Childs and
j H. T. Besse was selected, to which the
I depositors will assign their claims in
case it becomes necessary to take such
I action. ' . '' " Â- v _;

ATLANTA, Ga., March B.â The
Tenth Immunes . (colored), Colonel
Jones, who were mustered out at
Macon to-day, began to show their ill
temper as soon as the train bearing
the negroes home began to move out of
Macon. Producing revolvers and other
arms which they in some way managed
to smuggle with them they began fir

every direction as the train sped on,
and passers-by were compelled to seek
shelter. Luckily only one person was
shot in Macon, Will Goodyear, a 16

fractured by a ball. As the train
passed the various stations on the road
the rioting was renewed, shots being
fired from the train at the people
standing on the platforms.
At Griffin, Ga., where the first sec

stopped at Griffin the negroes, who by
this time had filled up on whisky, be
gan firing their pistols and yelling like
Indians. Over 200 shots were fired, and
the police were powerless to resist. The
city was at the mercy of the negroes,
who kept up a fusillade of shots until
the train was carried beyond the city
limits. The news of the outrageous
conduct spread rapidly over Griffin,
and it was determined that the next
section of the train should be held in
check.
Major Davis ordered out the Grif
fin Rifles on his own responsibility*, as
there was no time to lose. In addi
tion to the militia, the Mayor deputized
nearly a hundred citizens to assist the
officers in preserving the peace and
protecting the city. About 5:10 o'clock
the second section came in sight and
above the roar of the train could be .
heard the rattle of firearms which were I
being discharged indiscriminately.
When the train came to a standstill the
negroes saw 200 heavily armed men,
who commanded them to keep quiet. ,
The negroes were awed, and with few
exceptions were as docile as lambs, i
To those who proved fractious cracked
heads were administered. When the
train pulled out from the depot and the
negroes thought they were out of !
reach of the citizens they began firing
at houses. At the first shot a volley j
was poured into the disappearing
train by the citizens and militia. Un
fortunately George Agee, a trainman,
was shot in the abdomen and fatally
wounded and one negro was clipped on
the shoulder. by a bullet.
As the several sections came Into the
union depot they were met by the po
lice reserve, heavily armed. The ne
groes were evidently awed and gave the j
police no trouble. The Tenth was re- :
cruited from all parts of the country.
The negroes for the most part are from

all of them were sent out of Atlanta to
their destinations before the night 'was

SULLIVAN WILL GET
A NEW COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, March S.â The pro
posed restoration of a former pay officer
of the navy to his corps with the rank
he would have had had a court-martial
not dismissed him from the service Is
causing bitter comment among paymas
ters. But the President is understood to
have ordered that a commission be made
out for his signature, and the appointment
will unquestionably be Issued.
The case is that of former Paymaster
John Clyde Sullivan, who was dismissed
from the navy a few years ago for em
bezzlement, It having been .alleged that
he made personal use of Government
funds to the amount of $6000. The money
was refunded when an Inspector discov
ered Sullivan's accounts to be wrong,
but the court-martial found him guilty
of fraudulent conduct, and he was dis
missed. Mr. Sullivan is said to hail from
Canton Ohio, and has always had strong
political support. For a number of years
a bill has been before Congress to restore
him to his former corps with the rank
he would have held but for dismissal.
The measure was defeated at every ses
sion until the one just ended, when it was
passed and signed.
Sullivan will now take his place at the
foot of the grade of lieutenant command
ers and resume his duties with increased
rank after several years of Inaction. Sul
livan is well known at Mare Island,
where he was stationed at the time of his
trial. His bill for relief was deemed a
meritorious one by Senator Perkins, who
took an active part in securing its pas

two distinguished German travelers, Professor Futterer of Karlsruhe,
geologist, and Dr. Holterer-Lorrach of Baden, who have just crossed
Northeastern Thibet from Turkestan, discovering the source of the
Yellow River and entering China by the northwest.
In upper Taho Valley they were attacked by about thirty robbers.
The explorers returned the fire and wounded some of their assail

ants of the district advised the explorers to make compensation to
avert more serious consequences later. Accordingly one of the wound

Futterer made a valuable geological collection, besides taking

"GET A GUN, SIR,"
CRIES JACK CHINN
Bronston Obliges the
Colonel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LEXINGTON, March Colonel
Jack Chirm, the celebrated racehorse
man and politician, attacked Senator
Charles J. Bronston, one of the leading
Democrats o_ the State, in the lobby of
the Phoenix Hotel here this afternoon
to challenge him to mortal combat over
an old score between these dis
tinguished Kentucky politicians. The
Democratic State Central and execu
tive committee were in session at the
Phoenix at the time, and not less that
300 of the most prominent men in the
State were in the lobby. But for in
tervention on the part of friends of the
would-be combatants Kentucky would
have added another to her long list of
tragedies.
â  Senator Goebel and General P. Wat
Hardin, leading aspirants for the
Democratic nomination for Governor,
were near by when Chirm attacked
Bronston and took prominent parts in
keeping the gentlemen apart. While
Chirm claims he has been waiting for a
chance to get even with Bronston on
account of the bill the latter filed in a
lawsuit in which Mrs. Chirm was
charged with fraud, politicians claim
politics was really at the bottom of the
trouble.
Bronston had only entered the lobby
a few minutes beforehand and was in
conversation with a correspondent
.when Chirm approached the Lexington
Senator and said:
"Have you got your gun?"
"No, but I can get it," promptly re
plied Bronston.
"Go and get It; how long will it take
you?" asked the agitated Chirm.
"I can be here with it in ten minutes,"
said Bronston, and then the colonel said
he would wait for the Senator's return,
at the same time hurling an ugly and
unprintable name at Bronston. When
Chirm cursed Bronston the latter, al
though he knew his adversary was
armed, rushed at him. Senator Goebel
rushed in between the men and pushed
Chirm back. Others intervened and the
men were kept apart.
Bronston went away, but true to his
words returned in ten minutes with a
44 caliber Colt's revolver, nearly two
feet long. He entered the hotel lobby
with the formidable weapon in his hand
and sought Chirm, who had been
dragged into a room by friends. Brons
ton waited an hour'for Chirm to make
his appearance, but he didn't come.
Both men were then arrested. Chirm
was put under a bond of $5000 while
Bronston was released.
During the afternoon fully 2000 per
sons surrounded the hotel and filled Its
lobby, expecting to see a repetition of
the famous Swope-Godloe affair. .
It is the impression that Chirm will
be challenged to a duel to-morrow.
Both men are of the gamest fighting
stock in Kentucky and both 'swear ven
geance. It is predicted this will result
in one of the greatest feuds in the his
tory of Kentucky.

TIDAL WAVE ON
KOREA'S COAST
Gale Carries Death to
Thousands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, March B.â According |
to news received from the Korean capital
by the R. M. S. Empress of India, mile j
after mile of the Korean shore was de- j
vastated by a terrible storm, followed by
a tidal wave, in the opening week of Feb- j
ruary. The storm broke upon the un- !
fortunate country so suddenly that the j
boating population had no time to seek
shelter. The loss of life all along the j
coast is appalling. The Chemulpo corre- ;
spondent of the Shanghai Mercury writes â 
to his paper of the disaster as follows:
"The black clouds had hardly shrouded
the blue sky on the morning of Friday
last, February 3, when a terrible rain and
wind storm swept up and down the coast.
On the southwest and west coast it was
most violent. Here it raged with an aw
ful intensity, and the seas swept up and
carried away acre after acre or the
wooden buildings of the natives. Many
thousands of lives were lost, not to men
tion the vast amount of property de
stroyed. The village of Kuhgsan was
perhaps the greatest sufferer. Here one
of the Japanese coasting steamers broke
from her moorings and was driven upon
some rocks and then was carried high
up ashore and many hundreds of yards
inland by an unusually high tidal wave.
The sea rose so high that all the houses
within considerable distance of the beach
were washed away and two lives were
lost.
"At Chemulpo a Japanese schooner in
the height of the gale was sunk at her
own mooring in the inner harbor. She
was laden with coal. The harbor is
strewn with the wreckage of countless
sampans and junks, and hundreds of bod
ies have been washed ashore. The em
bankment by the custom-house, lately
built in connection with the railway, has
been washed away.
"The stone beacon on the north watcher
has been completely swept away. This
was erected in IS9O by an American rail
way contractor under an agreement with
the Commissioner of Customs for $26,000.
The work was done without any official
supervision, and though it was well fin
ished, doubts .were ever and anon ex
pressed about its' capacity of weathering
a storm. The work was finished In De
cember and- forthwith handed over to the
charge of the customs,' and $10,000 was
paid on account, with a promise that the
balance would be squared up by January
5. But the Korean Government, acting on
its old principle of delaying payments as
much as it is possible, had not paid the
balance when the storm broke out. Then
the Government refused to pay anything
further, alleging, though rather iate in
the day. defects of construction. But the
Lord High Treasurer soon found he was
not dealing with a Chinese contractor and
had to pay the money, and quickly, too."

ly 2000 acres oLwhat is commonly known
as the bank land, or 6000 acres In all. He
will devote all his energies and resources
to a barley crop.
The tule land Is the richest and most
productive farming land in the State.
In seasons when it can be kept clear of
water It yields enormously. The cost of
plowing and seeding Is considerably less
than the expense of plowing and seeding
the high land of the valley. A few spring
showers to give the young grain a start
is all that is necessary. There is a great
deal of moisture below, and it continues
to rise during the season, thus insuring a
lusty, healthy growth, without the neces
sity for further heavy rains. The season
Is so well advanced that nothing short of
an extraordinary flood can prevent big
crops in District 108.

SAUSALITO, March B.â When the hour
arrived for the trial of the five pea-and
shell game operators who were arrested
at Tiburon for fleecing a Santa Rosa con
tractor out of $115, none of them ap
peared. They gave cash bail aggregat

PRESERVATION OF FORESTS
DENUDATION OF MOUNTAINS
TO BE CHECKED.
Further Storage of Surplus Rainfall
in Southern California the
Main. Object of the Or
ganization, i
Special "Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March B.â The For
est and Water Society of Southern Cali
fornia was organized this morning. In
response to an invitation from the
Southern California Academy of
Sciences a number of men repre
senting various local Interests gath
ered at the Chamber of Commerce to
form an organization that shall have
as its object the preservation of sur
plus water in Southern California, The
objects of the new organization are:
First Further storage of the surplus
rainfall in the wet season for summer
use; reclamation and improvement of
the desert and arid lands by this
means; to support the work in this
line being done by the United States
Geological Survey.
Secondâ lnstitution of a rational sys
tem of managing forests and mountain
watersheds.
The following statement of the water
situation in Southern California was
made:
The safety of the community demands
the arrest of all further forest denudation
In Southern California. The sole enemy
in this is fire. The increasing ravages of
fire are a menace to every watershed in
Southern California, Forest denudation
has increased torrent and flood action on
a rainfall not increased. It has created
torrents, has caused serious damage
where watersheds have been much in
jured, as in the watersheds of the San
Gabriel and Santa Clara. On the other
hand, mountain streams and springs have
given out, lessening the summer supply,
to the injury of irrigation.
Besides these Important considerations
also is the probable and unfavorable
modification of the climate due to undue
forest denudation. Greater extremes of
heat and cold must be expected where the
forest covering is removed. The forest is
like a blanket over tho mountainsâ
retards radiation of heat. Air on a de
nuded mountain rapidly cools, flows down
the naked mountain sides and canyons
out into the swails and lowlands, in crop
and orchard. This means more severe
frosts. Extremes of beat must also be
more numerous and agricultural returns
must diminish.

WILL OFFER UP
PRAYER FOR RAIN
LOS ANGELES, March B.â ls God withholding rain because the natives are rebellious against him?- Some min
isters credited with more than ordinary power of thought are considering this abstruse question.
The Methodist clergymen of this city have set aside Wednesday. March 15, as a day of fasting, humiliation .
and prayer. By this means they hope to learn why there is a lack of rain. . <
"I" do not believe much in the wrath of God," said the Rev. Burt Estes Howard. "I think nature is very j
apt to take its own course in these matters. However, I do think that a day of prayer and humiliation will
be good for the people." â '-âÂ«'-'",_
Rev. Warren F. Day has signified his willingness to join in the services of the day of humiliation. God could
work a miracle if he chose. He chooses generally to answer prayers in the most natural way. Of old God withheld
rain because of the hardness of people's hearts. I believe he does It now. I believe also that he answers prayers."
Other eminent divines that have approved the action of the Methodist ministers in this matter are Right Rev.
Bishop Johnson, A. C. Smither, Hugh K. Walker and P. F. Bresee.
The Baptist ministers also will devote the day to fasting and prayer.
The Methodist ministers sent a letter to all ministers ln Southern California, as follows:
We request all our people and pastors and members of our sister churches to set apart a day for
fasting and humiliation before God that we may have a due sense of our own dependence upon God; of our un
designed neglect of duties; of our failure or refusal to walk in the way of his commandments, and for prayer
that he will mercifully forgive our sins, quicken us by his grace, fill us with his love.
LIGHT SHOWERS IN CALIFORNIA.
REDDING, March Reports from
Hetten, the stock region of Southern
Trinity, indicate that the winter has
been unusually favorable for stock.
The heavy fall of snow was confined
principally to the mountains, and but
little feeding of stock had to be done
in the valleys. In the Long Ridge re
gion of Mendocino County, adjoining
Southern Trinity, about the same con
ditions are met with, the winter so far
having been the best for stockmen in
many years. A sale of 15,000 clips of
fall wool was effected in Tehama Coun
ty last week. This is worthy of note,
because it is the first sale that has
been made in some time. The 15,000
clips weighed 65,000 pounds, bringing
7*4 cents a pound. Charles Mores was
the purchaser. There is more unsold
wool stored in Tehama County at the
present writing than for several years.
The cattle market in Northern Califor
nia Is so buoyant, the demand exceed
ing the offerings with rising prices,
that stockmen are convinced that an
era of high prices has come to stay.
The man with a big herd of cattle and
a good range occupies about the same
relative position with respect to profits
as the mine owner with a paying prop-
erty.
GUERNEVILLE, March Bâ Cloudy
weather prevailed all yesterday and
last night. This morning light showers
set in, wetting down vegetation and
laying the dust. Barring late March
frosts, Western Sonoma is now sure of
enormous yields.
WOODLAND, March 7. â Copious
rains this month and April showers are
necessary to insure the usual crop of
hay and an average yield of grain in
Capay Valley. Many farmers are appre
hensive that the rainfall will not be
sufficient and that these crops will be
i short and may possibly be a total fail
-1 ure. Twenty-three tests made in va
! rious places and in different qualities of
i soil show that after digging through a
dry surface of from four to eight inches
plenty of moisture is found in the soil,
ln every Instance at the depth of twen
ty-four inches the soil was so damp
that it adhered to the shovel used in
, digging. This would indicate that con
-1 ditions are favorable for fruit trees and
â  that they can stand several weeks of
' continuous dry weather. Good rains
' next month will be in ample time to
j insure heavy yields in both orchard
j and vineyard, but there is danger that
j the showers may come too late to save
i the hay and grain crops. If there is no
: exaggeration in the reports sent in
; from Vacaville, Winters and other ear
ly fruit belts, conditions for a good
fruit crop in Western Yolo are more
I favorable than in any other part of the
: State. Early in the season there was
j some apprehension among the fruit
! growers that the apricot, peach and al
-1 mond trees were dropping their bloom,
but the season is far enough advanced
: to show conclusively that these fears
I were not well grounded. The Indica
i tions are now favorable for a heavy
! yield of apricots and peaches and the
I prospects for a good almond crop were
never better. Indeed, all trees look
well, and old settlers agree that horti
cultural prospects were never more
promising than they are this season.
There is no longer any danger to be
I apprehended from late frosts. With
! out more rain there will be at least a
j partial crop of fruit. The normal rain
; fall for March and April will Insure the
j largest crop in the history of the val-
ley.
PLACERVILLE, March The long
continued drought has given way to
â  welcome rain, the precipitation com
| mencing at 6 p. m. Indications are for
I a copious rainfall in the western part
of the county and a heavy snowfall on
the mountains. The past month was
the dryest February in over a quarter
of a century. The rain is timely, but
crops could have withstood the drought
for a month longer.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, March B.â is
cloudy and threatening to-night. Crops
in this section look fine and are grow
â¢ ing well. Late sown grain is especial
ly promising.
BAKERSFIELD, March B.â lt has
been cloudy here this afternoon, but
i there are no other indications of rain.
j The barometer remains above the rain
I point and no rain may be looked for for
! several days at least. Crops are suf
fering much for want of moisture. Sev
eral grain growers sold their crops to
! sheep men for feed at 50 cents an acre.
Ranches in the northern part of the
county are absolutely bare. Rain would
do no good now.
NEVADA, . MsYch B.â Began raining
briskly late this afternoon and this
evening the indications are favorable
for a continuance of the storm. . Only
thirty Inches has fallen in this city, 25
per cent short of the previous average
of seasons to date. When to-day's
storm came farmers in the lower part
of the county were complaining of
-scarcity of feed and miners were
alarmed as to the outlook for next sum
mer's supply of water. Confidence is
now restored and everybody Is happy
and hopeful. -
EUREKA, March B.â There has been
a total rainfall thus far this season of
24.27 inches, as against 26 Inches to the
same j date last year. The crop pros
pects are excellent, there never having
been a better outlook in this county.
The dairy interests were never in better
condition, but the outlook for lumber
is not so favorable owing to the scarcity
of rain in other portions of the State.
A dry season in California means less
sales of lumber for Humboldt mlllmen.
OROVILLE, March B.â Two light
rains have fallen here lately and the
grain crop is looking exceptionally well.
Pasturage is so far scant. With spring
showers both grain and hay will be
good. The fruit crop is very promising,
but all depends upon late frosts so far
as deciduous crops . are concerned.
Without frost the crop will be very
heavy. There "is every, promise of a
magnificent olive and L orange crop. The
orange trees are full of buds. The snow
on the mountain ridges is not over three
feet deep, but It is thought there will
be abundant water for all 'irrigation
needed. .'
VISALIA, March The last rain in
this county fell on February 2; .37 of an
inch, malting 5.67 Â£or the season. The
THE SA_T FRANCISCO CALL., THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1899.
j month of dry weather that followed
; has been damaging to growing grain.
| W heat oh the plains is suffering now
and some is ruined. Grain nearer the
foothills is faring better, but will be a
. failure if rain does not fall within ten
j days or two weeks. There is little feed
I for stock.
SANTA ROSA, March Rain began
falling here shortly after noon to-day.
Every indication favorable for a con
tinued downpour. While crops were
not suffering in this section the storm
is very acceptable.
GILROY, March B.â lt has been
cloudy here to-day and there are strong
indications of rain. It cannot come too
soon if the grass and grain are to be
saved. Thus far the orchards have not
suffered, but they must have rain with
in two weeks.
HOLLISTER, March B.â lf rain comes
within two weeks fair crops will be as
sured, otherwise a partial failure of all
crops will result, as It is not expected
fruit will escape the severe frosts forth
coming.
AUBURN, March B.â lt commenced
raining this evening. The wind is in
the southeast, with every Indication for
a good shower. Although the grain in
this immediate vicinity could stand the
drought several weeks longer any ad
ditional shower would prove a boon to
stockmen and assure a bountiful grain
crop. The fruit growers are dependent
upon the South Yuba water ditch and
that company claims to have sufficient
water in the reservoir to meet all de
mands, but. the miners need rain and
snow badly and it is doubtful if enough
will fall now to help surface mining.
The large mines using water as power
are already in need.
MODESTO, March B.â rain has
fallen at Modesto since February 2, but
growing grain is showing well, except
on light, gravelly soil, where rain is
now needed. Wheat will yield good
crops if rains come within three weeks.
Heavy dews have kept the grain green.
The weather is cloudy this evening.
MADERA, March B.â The weather is
very warm. Indications for rain are
poor. Grain is suffering. With rain in
a few days part of the crop will be
saved from late sown grain. The ear
lier sown is nearly all a failure. In the
foothill section crops are in better con
dition than on the plains, having had
more rain. The recent hot days and
dry winds were very damaging.
NAPA, March B.â The fall of rain in
Napa County to date has been about 11
j inches. Light rainfall this afternoon.
Crops, grain, grass and fruit generally
! are in good condition.
YUBA CITY, March B.â Rain began
falling this afternoon. Five one-hun
dredths of an inch were registered,
making for the season 8.33 Inches.
Crops are not suffering here yet from
the drought, except grain recently
sown, but will need considerable spring
showers to mature. The weather is
clearing.
WILLOWS, March B.â Wheat and
barley are in splendid condition. With
the usual spring showers Glenn County
will harvest an immense crop. With
out any more rain, the yield will be
from four to six sacks to the acre. No
damage has been done to fruit so far.
On the hill cattle ranges the grass is
backward, and In some places stock is
suffering.
CHICO, March The cool, cloudy
weather for the past four days, with
occasional light showers, has been of
great benefit to all growing crops in
this section. Late sown grain has been
particularly benefited by it. Summer
fallow crops look most encouraging.
There was a light fall of rain this after
noon.
SUISUN, March B.â The grain crops
of Solano County never looked more
encouraging. They are not suffering
from lack of moisture just now. With
rain later the yield will be the best In
years. With the exception of cherries
and apricots, the fruit crop is expected
to be large. Indications are excellent
for prunes, peaches and almonds. The
absence of heavy frosts and late rains
insures a prosperous year for the or
chardlsts.
UKIAH, March B.â Rain began fall
ing this morning and continued inter
mittently most of the day. The precip
i Ration was .30 inch, and for the season
18.40 inches. Crops in the valley look
well, and with the usual spring rains
the yield will be excellent. For the upÂ»
lands, however, much more rain is
needed In order to insure pasturage.
Wells and streams are very low for this
season of the year.
COLUSA, March B.â No rain has
fallen here since the second week in
January. Crop prospects never were
better than now, but rain is needed.
Indications to-night are good for rain.
AFTERMATH OF THE
DINGLEY FUNERAL
NEW YORK, March B.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald sends the following: Clerk McDowell of the House of Representa
tives has declined to pay some of the bills submitted on account of the
funeral of the late Representative Dingley on the ground that they are
exorbitant. > The total cost of the funeral when all the bills have been
paid will be about $4500. The largest amount Is for a special train of
four cars which carried the funeral party from Washington to Lewis
ton, Maine. This cost $3840, including meals served on the cars. This
bill Mr. McDowell paid without opposition. V-'V
The bills on which payment has been suspended are those for ser
vices of various kinds at 'Lewiston. A Lewiston undertaker put in. a
bill for $500 for his services, and bills for $75 for a steel case in the receiv
ing vault; $75 for a slate case in the grave and $90 for the catafalque
on which the casket rested while the body of Mr. Dingley was lying in
state at Lewiston. He also put in a bill for thirty-six carriages,
though only eight were used. Mr. McDowell also thought the bill of
$60 for "four trained singers," who sang at the funeral in Lewiston,
was exorbitant, but- he paid it under protest.
Mr. Dlngley's funeral was one of the most expensive that has recent
ly been paid for by the House of Representatives. That of Representa
tive Hurley of New York, who died recently, cost only $1109, and that of
! Representative Cranford of Texas, now in progress, will cost compara
i tively little, notwithstanding the long distance from Washington to the
â¢ place of burial in Texas. Only one car was chartered for the Cranford
â  funeral party, and it will not return to Washington, as only five mem
j bers of the party will come back to this city, and they have been sup
; plied with railroad tickets.
SANTA CRUZ, March Rain is
falling this evening, with prospects for
heavy showers before morning.
SALINAS, March B.â Despite the fact
that no rain has fallen in over four
weeks, crops and feed look promising
all over the country, except In a few
spots. Ranchers report that there still
remains a great amount of moisture in
the ground, despite the drought and
warm, drying winds, and that a good
crop is assured. Should there be a suf
ficiency of seasonable spring rains more
than the average crop would result.
The weather to-night is cloudy and
threatening, the barometer 30.08 and
falling. The rainfall for the season to
date is 5.55.
SAN DIEGO, March B.â lt Is cloudy
to-night, with wind from the south.
Conditions are favorable for rain, but
up to 11:30 p. m. none had fallen.
STOCKTON, March B.â Rain com
menced falling here this evening. With
a reasonable amount of rain from now
to the end of the season the San Joa
quin crop would be heavy. What pas
ture land there is in the county will be
greatly helped by the fall of to-night.
SAN JOSE, March B.â Rain began to
fall here at 6:30 this evening and is now,
coming down heavily. If it continues
until an inch or more shall have fallen
it will be worth thousands of dollars to
the fruit. men and farmers of this val
ley. The grain is now tn need of moist
ure and this rain probably will answer
all present requirements. On account
of the dryness of the last month many
of the fruit trees on the high places
have died, while those in the valley are
just budding and require irrigation to
develop the buds. One good soaking
at this time will, in the opinion of
orchardists, mean a large fruit crop this
year, for there have been no damaging
frosts this spring. The rain also will
have the effect of reviving business and
inducing many extensive improvements
which have been held in abeyance be
cause of the dry winter and the pros
pect of "hard" times.
FRESNO, March B.â The sky has been
clouded In this vicinity at times during
the past two days, but as yet
no rain has fallen.. The weather
during the present week has been
marked by heavy winds from the north
west which have had a blighting effect
on the grain crop. The fruit crop is
doing well and will be larger than usual
unless late frosts occur. Even the most
sanguine have about abandoned hope
of rain in time to benefit the grain crop
and the verdict seems to be that the
present year will be a dry one. Wheat
j in many parts of the county is already
j beginning to suffer and rain even at
I the present time would have to be
! heavy in order to do any good. Unless
â it rains within two weeks the grain
j crop is doomed in this part of the val
i ley.
MARYSVILLE, March Rain is
j falling here this evening, with a pros
pect that it will continue. The grain
I acreage in this vicinity is heavy, al
! though the crop is somewhat backward.
; Fruit . prospects never were better.
! There has been no injury of any kind
j from frosts. Neither fruit nor grain
| will suffer if there be no more rain for
two weeks.

FOR A SURVEY OF
THE CANAL ROUTES
NEW TORK. March B.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: If President
McKinley adepts the advice of a number
â¢of Senators and members of his Cabinet
he will appoint an entirely new commis
sion to investigate the Nicaraguan and
Panama canal routes in accordance with
recent legislation. The matter was con
sidered at a Cabinet meeting yesterday.
i It Is the belief of some Cabinet mem
bers that owing to its experience the
: Walker Commission is especially fit to
j continue the work under the new pro
! visions. The President Is undecided on
â  the subject, thinking it may have been .the
I purpose of Congress to have a new com-
I mission named, the members of which
I have not participated in r-ny previous sur
vey, and will therefore submit an impar
i tial report. Suggestions are made also
that the President enlarge the Walker
Commission by appointing several civilian
engineers. A decision is probable In a few

HERR RAFFEU Chief Cause of the Recent
Trouble in SarT)oa.
HERR RAEFEL
RECALLED FROM
SAMOAN ISLES
Chief Source of Fric
tion Removed.
PROSPECTS ARE PEACEFUL
i
NATIVES ARE INCLINED TO
SUPPORT MALIETOA.
i The Decisions of Chief Justice Cham
bers Meet With General Ap
proval â Outrages Committed
by Mataafa's Followers.
The chief source of all the trouble in
Samoa has been removed from the group,
and hereafter it may be hoped that peace
and quiet will prevail in this much-vexed
Island paradise. The arrival of Herr J.
Raffel, the ex-president of _ie Apia Mu
nicipal Council, on the Alameda yesterday
marked the close of the brief but trou
blesome Samoan rebellion. Herr Raffel
left Samoa in a state of partial collapse,
due to the prolonged strain cast upon
him by his trying position as supporter
of Mataafa. He came into direct con
flict with the Supreme Court, at the head
of which was an American citizen, Chief
Justice Chambers, and not unnaturally
he got the worst of the encounter.
Herr Raffel does not care to talk about
the matter himself, but the latest ad
vices from Apia indicate "that Judge
Chambers has won all along the line.
His decision, awarding the throne to Ma
lietoa Tanu rather than to Mataafa, has
met with general approval among the na
tives, most of whom are only waiting un
til a definite settlement Is arrived at in
order to declare their loyalty. The peo
ple of Tutuila, where the new United
States coaling station is placed, have al
ready shown their preference in a very
marked manner. When the exiled Ma-
Hetoa chiefs reached Paga-Pago they
were received with every demonstration
of hospitality. Pigs and fowls innumer
able were killed in their honor. On the
other hand, the Mataafa men, nominally
guarding the prisoners, were regaled on
nothing but taro, the commonest of veg
etables. _ , *'
According to Herr Raffel, Judge Cham
bers' decision ran contrary to the ex
pressed wish of the Samoan people. How
ever, It has now been ascertained that the
majority of the natives are in favor of
Malletoa, though they have hitherto been
deterred by threats from declaring their
true feelings. Herr Raffel, who was the
Royal Treasurer as well as President of
the Municipal Council, endeavored to or
ganize at the public expense a regiment
of 1000 Mataafa warriors. They were to
'be supplied with modern arms and abun
'danco of ammunition, and everything
might have gone Off well had not the Su
preme Court again Interfered. The Brit
ish Consul appealed to the court, and a
leading Savaii trader, E. J. Allen, applied
for a mandatory injunction against Dr.
Raffel and all his officers concerned In
the collection of taxes and customs, re
straining them from expending Govern
ment moneys on this so-called army. The
Injunction was promptly granted, and
with it the scheme for the formation of a
Mataafa regiment came to an end.
The fact is that the provisional Govern
ment established by Mataafa and tempo
rarily .recognized for police purposes by
the foreign consuls, has not come up to
expectations. Mataafa's people, not being
under proper control, have done a great
deal of looting in and around Apia, and,
further, the provisional Government has
endeavored to impose unjust taxation
upon Malietoa's supporters. Fortunately,
owing to the presence of two British men
of-war, the Porpoise and the Royalist,
any active outbreak was avoided. Ma
taafa's people. were compelled to apolo
gize for indignities inflicted on British
and American subjects, and peace was re
stored. H. J. Moore, an American citi
zen, who has all along taken the German
side of the quarrel, was summoned by
Chief Justice Chambers to answer a
charge of contempt of court, because of
a letter which he had published in the
Samoan Herald disputing the authority
of the Supreme Court. However, Mr.
Moore came down in time, and having
amply apologized was let off with a fine.
Vaillma, the historic home of Robert
Louis Stevenson, together with . its . flne
plantation, has been sold to a German
merchant. Herr Kunst, for the nominal
sum of $8750.
APIA, Samoa, Feb. 22.â Dr. Joannes
Raffel, president of the municipality of
Apia, departed for San Francisco on the
Alameda this afternoon. Until the ves
sel was well under way It was not a cer
tainty that he should be allowed to leave
Samoan waters, and his sailing was not
unattended by exciting incidents. .
Herr Raffel was adjudged guilty of con
tempt of court some time ago and Chief
Justice Chambers determined upon hold
ing him upon Samoan territory. When
the Moana sailed he was among her listed
passengers, but was seized before he had
an opportunity to become settled in his
stateroom. The Alameda was his next
chance, and he made every preparation
for departure. When his intention be
came known it was announced that his
way would be blocked and all available
influence was brought to bear upon Chief
Justice Chambers to permit Raffel to de
part In peace. . , V .
A body composed of the heads of the
leading German firms called upon the
Chief Justice in his behalf and pleaded hia.
case. Chambers remained obdurate, how
ever, and refused to grant the permission
unless the request was made directly
through the German Consul. The peti
tioners took their leave and soon sought
out the German Consul, Herr Rose, who
acceded to their request and personally
appealed to the Chief Justice.
The Alameda was billed to sail at 3
p. m. to-day, and Raffel went aboard
early. About noon the British man-of
war Porpoise steamed out of the harbor
and laid directly in the Alameda's course.
This action caused an air of uneasiness,
which was intensified when the Rovallst,
smother British man-of-war, swung into
position within distance of communica
tion from the shore. Both vessels rested
within sight of each other and awaited
the departure of the steamship.
When the hour set for the departure ar
rived the Alameda glided away from the
wharf and headed down the stream. An
immense crowd lined the shores and
await..] developments. The presence of
the German man-of-war Falke was an
other source of attention as she shifted
her position and activity was apparent on
her decks. '-yyyy--
Shortly after the .Alameda had gained
headway, however, something happened
which was calculated to remove all sus
pense from the mind of Raffel. The Roy
alist hoisted a series of signals and her
sister engine of destruction turned and
leisurely steamed into the harbor. The
Porpoise passed close to the Alameda,
but made no exchanges, the signal, in all
probability, having been a message that
Raffel had secured his liberty and was
no longer desired by Chambers.
HERRINGTON'S COUNSEL
ASKS FOR A DELAY
Evidently Not in Favor of an Inves
tigation Into Ballot
Frauds.
SAN JOSE, March S.â The discovery of
fraud perpetrated in the Herrlngton-
Campbell contest during the recount of
the ballots is the principal topic of dis
cussion just now. Judge Hyland's court
was crowded this morning at the time set
for contestant's counsel to decide whether
he wanted an investigation. The specta
tors were doomed to disappointment, as
Attorney H. A. Moore asked for another
day for consideration. It is said the Her
rington forces, in whose favor the ballots
were tampered with, will not demand an
Investigation. They propose to l*t the
court decide In favor of Campbell and
then appeal to the Supreme Court.
This may not satisfy the court, and
Judge Hyland may insist on the fraud he
has discovered being looked into. The
Democratic and Populist county central
committees and the Republican Good
Government League offered a reward of
$250 for the conviction of any one tamper
ing with the ballots, and since this gross
fraud has come out they have reiterated
their offer. The Good Government League
has offered an additional reward of $50
for any evidence of persons who tampered
with ballots during the contest.'
The Inky thumb marks on ballots where
crosses were made It is believed will lead
to a clew, and efforts will be made to
locate the guilty man. The attention of.
the Grand Jury will be directed to the
case.
The contest comes up again to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock.
Cutting Insurance Rates.
WOODLAND, March There Is much
commotion in local insurance circles, and
if one-half the rumors in circulation have
any foundation a lively Insurance war is
likely to be instituted. Several companies
have already sent special agents to this
city to assist the local agents in protect
ing their business. It has been known for
some time that rate cutting has been go
ing on, but there was no intimation of a
possible open declaration of war. until the
arrival In this city of Roger B. Friend, a
representative of the Thurlngla Insurance
Company of Germany. .This company be
longs to the compact, but threatens to
withdraw.

fidelity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. March 8. â The
thirty years of turmoil in the Mayberry
household are to have an airing, so the
wife has filed suit for divorce in the
Superior Courtâ the plaintiff Mrs.
Emily Gray Mayberry, the defendant
Colonel Edward Leodore Mayberry.
The colonel is said to be worth a mil
lion. His home estate, El Molino. lo
cated between Pasadena and Alham
bra, is one of the most beautiful in
Southern California. The property is
named after a noted old Spanish mill
still standing within its confines,
which was built by the mission fathers
early in the century.
The divorce complaint is based on the
grounds of extreme cruelty and infidel
ity. The allegations cover forty-five
pages of typewritten matter.
The couple were wedded in San,
Francisco in 1870. Edward Mayberry.
aged 27, is an only child. Harry May
berry, aged 31, is a son of the plaintiff
by a former marriage.
The complaint recites almost endless
cruelty on the part of the husband. In
February, 1872, it is asserted. May
berry discovered his wife crying be
cause of her having surprised her hus
band while he was paying improper at
tentions to Lena Robinson, a servant.
Angered by his wife's tears, it is al
leged, the colonel struck Mrs. May
berry on the face with his fist. The
blow rendered her unconscious for
three days and resulted in per
manent paralysis of the ring finger of
her right hand, which she had raised
to avert the blow.
Later cruelty, the complaint states,
wrecked her health. The paralysis
spread from the finger to both hands
and then to the feet.
In 1575, the complaint alleges, the de
fendant beat his son Edward, then 4
years old, with a club. During the
summer he caused his wife further
mental suffering by undue familiarity
with two servants named Emma Rob
bins and Miss Lindy. * *
In 1879 the plaintiff went to a New-
York sanitarium for a few months and
returned cured of the paralysis, except
for a finger and the right wrist. The
injury to the wrist, she asserts, was
caused by her husband. She found him
beating the two boys with a riding
whip. The mother interfered. Colonel
Mayberry, it is alleged, seized her by
the wrist and threw her across a room.
While she was. absent in New York, it
is alleged, the . defendant lived with
Mrs. McGregor. The plaintiff says she
discovered this after her return. Shame
and humiliation caused the paralysis
to return. The paralysis was total by
1892. The plaintiff has since been en
tirely helpless.
Further allegations in the complaint
treat of the relations of Colonel May
berry and several servants, which are
said to have increased his wife's mental
distress. _2,_ __
DR. THOMPSON A
MARTYR TO DUTY
San Mateo Physician Stricken by
Scarlet Fever Contracted
From Patients.
SAN MATEO, March The sudden
and untimely death of Dr. H. Harrison
Thompson yesterday has cast a gloom
over the whole community. The popular
young physician was a martyr to his
duty, as he contracted scarlet fever and
diphtheria while attending the family of
Mr. Wescott. Two of the Wescott chil
dren were stricken by these dread dis
eases last week and Dr. Thompson re
sponded to a call to the quarantined home
on Thursday. On his return to the Hotel
Mateo, where he resided, he was taken
ill. Fearing he might spread the dis
ease, he requested to be taken back to
the Wescott home, and his wish was
granted.
The deceased was about 35 years old
and a graduate of Cooper Medical Col
lege in San Francisco. He was attend
ing physician to nearly all the wealthy
families of San Mateo. His father, who
is a wealthy resident of Salem, Or., ar
rived to-night to take the remains of his
son home.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March Another day ap
pointed for the election of Dan Burns
has- come and gone. Grove L. John
son's prophecy that the Candelarian
would be chosen to-day convened a
larger audience of spectators than
usually assembles to hear the Senators
and Assemblymen respond to their
names on the joint ballot for Senator.
There were no changes. The same old
story was told again and the convention
adjourned to meet to-morrow. There
are no signs to-night that the balloting
to-morrow will differ from that to-day.
Burns is weaker to-night than at any
other time since the beginning of the
contest, yet his chief adviser and
manipulator, Hervey Lindley, expresses
the greatest confidence in the ultimate
triumph of his cause. It is conceded
that Lindley is a bold, skillful and un
scrupulous political operator, who
knows the advantage of . organization.
He is determined to make the fight of
his life next 'week to accomplish the
election of his candidate. Behind him
are the forces of the Southern Pacific
and all the evil influences of the State.
Every agency that can be invoked to
thwart the' will of the people and pro
mote the success of Herrin's favorite
will be employed to break the forces
that have stood up so manfully in de
fense of the honor and good name of
California. *
There is no longer any mistake or
misjudgment in the character of the
contest to be fought next week. The
railroad will attempt by all the
means at hand to force the election of
Dan Burns. Threats of party venge
ance, promises of reward which can
never be kept, cajolery, persuasion
and combines of every kind will be
employed to rally every man that can
be rallied to espouse the cause of the
"Colonel."
A determined attempt will be made to
break the Grant lines after the caucus
scheme is abandoned. It seems now
that the work for a caucus is not being
pressed vigorously and perhaps in a day
or two activity in that direction will
cease. The fight against the people will
not end with the overthrow of the cau
cus scheme. Efforts will be made to
induce passive Republicans and indif
ferent Democrats to absent themselves
from the convention. Some day toward
the close of next week when the at
tendance is light all the evil influences
will be brought to bear . to swell the
Burns vote to the number necessary
for a choice. It is all important now
that the representatives of the people â
the champions of honor and cleanliness
in public lifeâ shall be vigilant until
the finish. ',-â¢ V
The railroad has made the Issue. The
people of California did not seek it. It
was forced upon the State in a manner
that can never be forgotten and never
again be tolerated.
Burns was not a candidate for the
office of United States Senator when
the Senators and Assemblymen com
prising this Legislature were before the
voters of this State. If a design ex
isted to. bring forward Burns it was
carefully concealed from the people by
the arch-manipulators of, the corpora
tion. The voters of the State accepted
in good faith the statement of the cor
poration that the railroad was not in
politics. Republican orators and the
Republican papers assured the people
that the railroad was not an. issue in
the campaign. On the strength of that
assurance the party won a magnificent
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1899.
triumph. As soon as the votes were
counted the railroad cast aside all of
its pledges of non-interference and
brought forward a candidate whose as
pirations were never suggested to the
people.
Night and day since the result of the
election was announced the agents of
the railroad, assisted by the political
bosses of the party, Have been Working
to force the members of the Legisla
ture to indorse the candidate of the
corporation. In many way nine-tenths
of the people of the State have pro
tested against the perpetration of this
great political and moral outrage. So
vigorous has been the protestation that
all the influences working to compass
the success of Burns have not been
able to muster more than twenty
seven supporters of his cause in the
Legislature.
But while the people in their homes
and places of business, in their offices
and shops, on their vineyards and
farms, are protesting by letter.- and
telegrams against the election of Burns
to the Senate, the political
bosses, the agents of the railroad and
the touts of the race course are as
sembling at the capital of the State to
overthrow and set aside the plain will
of the honest people.
Fifty-eight Republican members of
the Legislature; who have been man
fully and steadfastly upholding the
honor of California in this remarkable
struggle, are apparently as firm and
resolute to-night as ever, but the time
has come when the force and power of
public judgment should be enlisted in
their support.
A voice of commendation should
come from every fearless pulpit and
every independent newspaper in the
State. These men are here, serving
without pay and without the hope of
reward other than that which the
conscience bestows for duty well per
formed.
As Republicans they are battling to
preserve the Republican party. Men
familiar with the history of political af
fairs in California know that the elec
tion of D. M. Burns at this time would
disrupt the Republican party in this
State. ;VV:V- ;
In the Assembly mix up to-day over
the Milton Green contempt proceedings
the Burns men by the employment of
notorious and desperate measures de
feated the Grant forces, but the con
troversy introduced an element of bit
terness between the two camps that
cannot be reconciled. There was a
rumor ' this forenoon that the Grant
forces were weakening and listening to
the dulcet overtures of Lindley. There
is no such report to-night. Every Grant
man has a tomahawk aloft for the
"Colonel." Charges of bad faith as be
tween camps are made by the Grant
men, who insist that there was a tacit
agreement with Burns that Green,
whose wife was sick nigh unto death,
should not be forced to come to Sacra
mento. Assertion is made that this
agreement was violated. The wrath of
the Grant men to-night is boundless.
Every sign of caucus has vanished and
every chance for an alliance of the
Burns and Grant men has gone glim
mering. â¢ V
"Where do we get off?" That is an
Inquiry occasionally heard in the San
Francisco delegation of Republicans.
There is a suspicion that the patron
age to be bestowed as a reward for up
holding the standard of Burns is to be
distributed to the interior members of
the Legislature. The time is coming
for a definite statement as to what the
San Francisco members are to receive.
There is still talk of an extra session
to elect a Senator, but that gives no
assurance to the San Franciscans that
the country members who are expected
to join the Burns column will not re
ceive the rewards while the San Fran
cisco members receive the praise and
promises for future recognition.
The defeat to-night of Dickinson's bill
in the Senate to enlarge the State Board
of Harbor Commissioners and redisttib
ute the patronage may have an impor
tant bearing on the Senatorial contest.
A great deal of foiling has been pro
voked by the defeat of the measure,
and Republicans who voted for the
measure are disgruntled because they
find themselves to be a minority of
their own party in the Senate. .It was
another defeat for Burns and the touts
are not in a good humor about it.
The aspect of the Senatorial fight has
undergone a marked change since noon
to-day. It is the opinion of well
informed and intelligent men that the
camp of Dan Burns is on the verge of
demoralization. There may he divided
inner councils. The outward signs show
a working at cross purposes. All the
progress . made toward the establish
ment of closer relations between the
Burns and Grant forces has been scat
tered to the winds. Senators Hoey and
Burnett who have been voting consist
ently with the Burns following went
outside the camp to-night and voted to
defeat the Harbor Commissioners' re
organization bill. The supporters of
General Barnes held, a conference to
night after the adjournment of the
Legislature.
It was resolved by those attending
that the proceedings should be kept as
secret as possible. It transpired that
the nineteen supporters of the general
who were present displayed the greatest
enthusiasm and confidence. There was
no suggestion of wavering and no al
lusion whatever was made to a caucus.
The conference was attended by Sen
| ators Bulla. Morehouse, Stratton, Luch
singer and Assemblymen Anderson,
| Atherton, Belshaw, Boynton. Brown,
Clough, Conrey, Knights, Knowland,
Lardner, Melick, Miller of Los Angeles,
Muenter, Robinson and Valentine. The
absentees were Senators Dickinson,
Taylor and Gillette. It is known to
night that the Barnes men are firmer
I than ever before.
U. S. Grant went to San Francisco
early this morning and returned late
to-night. Word comes from the Grant
camp that all caucus talk is ended. The
fight will be fought to the finish on the
floor of the joint convention.

noon in the shape of Kenncally's As

cure to the native-born and naturalized
citizens of the United States^ the exclu

State. ryy
Davls, Gillette and Sims opposed the
bill and Shortridge and Bulla spoke in
its favor. It was called unjust and un-
American by one side and a very good
measure by the other. It failed of pass
age, however, by a vote of 17 to 13, and
then Senator Leavitt gave notice of a
motion to reconsider.

that hereafter all bills enacting new or
amending old laws should be so fash

Senator Stratton started another pri
mary bill on its way to the Governor, a
duplicate of one which had passed both
houses and which every one supposed had
become a law. It had lain in the Gover
nor's office ten days and consequently be
came a law through lapse of time, but it
was found there was no enacting clause
in the bill sent to the Governor, and so all
the time put on It was lost. The new bill
will be rushed through as speedily as pos
sible. Senator Dickinson also submitted
a bill, a substitute for the dairy inspection
measure recently vetoed. :, -.-
A message from the Governor this even
ing gave notice that he had signed Sen
ate bill 277, which provided for the detail
of one of the officers of the National
Guard to ascertain and' pay armory rents,
armorers' wages and other expenses aris
ing out of the mustering in of portions of
the National Guard and Naval Militia into
the United States volunteer service; also
the expenses incurred in reorganizing the
National Guard and to result therefrom,
and making an appropriation to pay the
same. It is provided in the bill that the
officers appointed under its provisions
shall receive the same pay as an officer
of similar rank in the United States army
while he is engaged in the duties assigned
him. He is empowered to adjust all
claims, and these are afterward to he
passed upon by the Board of Military Au
ditors, and if they be approved a warrant
for their amounts shall be drawn on the
Treasurer. The bill appropriates $30,000 to
pay the claims which will be submitted.

ANOTHER INVESTIGATION
IS NOW UNDER WAY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March B.â George W. Ficks,
manager of the Clunie Opera House of
this city, appeared before the bar of the
Assembly this morning to say why he
should not be punished for having inter
fered with an officer of that body while
in pursuit of his duty. V "' ;
Ficks was haled to the bar of the As
sembly last night on a warrant issued by
Speaker Anderson. The offense with
which he was charged consisted in ob
structing a search made in the Clunic
Opera House by Assistant Sergeant at
Arms Dahle, who was in search of absent
Assemblymen pursuant to an order for a
call of the House.
When the Assembly was rapped to or
der on Monday night there was found to
; be no quorum, and a call was at once or
i dered. Dahle heard that there were a
I number of members absent without ex
cuses at the opera house and he went
there to get them.
Ficks refused to allow him to enter.

and not being sure of his position Dahle
and his assistants returned to the Assem
bly chamber. Last night there was an
other call, and this time Dahle insisted
upon entering when Ficks opposed him.
He got into the theater and began his
search, but the manager refused to allow
the lights to be turned up. and again
Dahle was balked. He demanded that the
lights he lighted, but Ficks refused, and
announced that he would shoot the first
man who attempted to do so.
Then Dahle got a warrant and brought
Ficks up to the bar of the House. On
motion of Grove Johnson he was released
on his own recognizance and ordered to
appear with counsel this morning.
When he turned up this morning Dibble
offered the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Speaker appoint a select
committee of three to take testimony and re
port the facts in connection with the arrest
of George XV. Ficks for Interfering with the
sergeant at arms and obstructing the process
of the House: that the Speaker assign one of
the official stenographers of the House to re
port the testimony and one of the committee
clerks to assist as clerk of said committee.
Resolved. That the committee be given power
to send for persons and papers.
Resolved. That said committee be instructed
to ascertain and report whether there were any
members of the Assembly attending the the
ater with which said Kicks is connected during
the session of the House without leave of ab
sence, and also whether any member of the
House advised or Instructed said Ficks to ob
struct the process of the House in any way.
Wade of Napa asked Dibble why the
last section of the resolution was insert
ed, and Dibble replied that he had been
informed that certain members of the
House who were present at the theater
without leave had assisted Ficks in keep
ing their presence known from the officer,
and that if this were the case the guilty
ones should be punished.
Dibble then moved that the committee
report on Friday next. It was so ordered,
and Ficks again released on his own re
cognizance.

THE PRACTICAL VIEW.
THAT Ingleside as now conducted is doomed is
a circumstance which seems to excite no ex
pression of regret. As a business proposition
Ingleside is bad for everybody but the proprietors. It
is a constant drain on the community, and for that
which it absorbs makes no return.
It is true that racing "puts money into circulation"
in certain channels, but it adds nothing to the wealth
of the community. The money it stimulates is merely
taken from legitimate channels and diverted to a
course always ending in the pocket of the speculator,
whether owner or bookmaker. There is no advantage
in. this, no impetus given to business, no industry pro-
The money which Ingleside attracts comes from
poor people, for the most part. They earn it by
labor, and then instead of paying the butcher and the
grocer and the landlord they wager it on a speed con
test which may have all been settled before the horses
left the post. They lose their own money, and in
desperation take money that does not belong to them.
This they also lose, but the money has been "put into
circulation." That it would have truly have been in
circulation if devoted to legitimate purposes is a fact
the touts ignore.
Business men would be glad to see racing re
stricted, and rather than see it go on at the riotous and
ruinous pace which now marks it would be glad to see
grass growing on the track. They have suffered
much. Their employes have been led into embezzle
ment and other forms of crime. This can be said
cf men and women. It can even be said of boys. A
spirit of distrust has arisen, and so strong is the
prejudice against the Ingleside institution that no
workman resorting there habitually can retain good
standing. He causes himself, whether justly or not,
to be suspected, and as a matter of protection his
employer watches him.
Racing, if honest and periodical rather than con
tinuous, would not be 'objectionable. Racing which
depends for its support upon the dollars of the de
luded poor has nothing to commend it, and the
sooner abolished the better.
Citizens of Spokane chased a man whom they sup
posed to have escaped from jail, but when they as
certained that he was a smallpox patient who had
broken away from the pesthousc the swiftness with
which their enthusiasm vanished would have given
points to a professional sprinter. There is always the
possibility that in attending to the business of some
body else one may catch more than he is after.
Italy is offended at the refusal of China to stand
and deliver. Italy has the same right to a portion of
the Orient that a footpad has to that which is in
your purse, yet if the footpad told you to throw up
your hands, and you demurred, probably he too would
be offended. A nation on the highway with a sand
bag is much like an individual.
A gentleman who with four comrades was through
the heroic efforts of some strangers saved from
drowning paid the gallant rescuers $5, and did not de
mand any change. Nevertheless, as a mere matter of
justice, the rescuers ought to send back at least a
dollar and six bits.
If the members of the State Senate can discern any
compliments in the estimate placed upon them by a
writer in the Sacramento Bee they have keener per

Setting tired of this chestnut
THE MAJORITY'S WILL.
IT does not seem to have occurred to the Burns
.Junta that it has always been left to a majority to
say whether there shall be a caucus or not. Yet
that is everywhere the usage. In other words, in
stead of the caucus ruling the majority, the majority
precedes the caucus and decides whether it will or not
invoke the caucus as an instrument of its will.
Every time Burns has tried to get a caucus this ma
jority has withstood and defeated him. Is it not time
that he subjected his will and surrendered his ambi
tion to the often expressed will of the majority? The
majority has decided repeatedly against a caucus, and
in joint convention it has nearly a hundred times de
cided against his aspiration to be Senator. In every
possible way the party by its majority in the Legis
lature has decided against Burns' candidacy and
against his schemes for making it successful.
This has been done because the party sees its de
struction in his success, and as the majority should
defend the life of the party, that high duty has been
performed in opposing him and should be to the end.
The party is entirely satisfied with the conduct of
its majority. It applauds, approves and will stand by
that majority, which has wisely decided that party in
terests do not require a caucus.
Mr. Burns is the bolter. He maintains a chronic
bolt from the decision of the majority. Had he not
been a bolter he would have closed his headquarters
and gone about his business long ago. Only a de
fiant and unjustifiable ambition which hopes to flour
ish over the ruin of the party has kept him at Sacra
mento and made the contest scandalous. Cancel the
bolters, cast out those who defy the majority, and the
State can' have a worthy Senator and the party can
have salvation without further delay.
THE NEW PRIMARY LOW.
THE chief problem to be solved in connection
with the new primary election law which went
into effect last week is whether or not the peo
ple for whose benefit it was enacted will go to the
polls and vote at elections held under it. In New York,
where a similar statute has been on trial for about
two years, there has been no change in the popular
indifference to primary political action, and there the
machinery of nomination is still, as of old, in the
hands of the bosses and their men. If the people of
California do not take sufficient interest in their poli
tics to attend the primaries authorized by the new law,
the experience of New York will doubtless be re
peated here.
So far as a layman may be permitted to judge, the
legal objections lodged against the former statute
declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in
March, 1898â have been obviated. Senator Stratton
attempted in that act to enlarge the qualifications of
voters at primaries, and for that reason his work was
annulled. In its decision in the Tulare County case
the Supreme Court discussed the question of a test
for voting, but did not decide it. Justice Garoutte,
who wrote the opinion, however, went far enough
with this argument to show that he did not regard a
test for voting with favor â power to make a
reasonable one including the power to make an un
reasonable oneâ and his suggestion that a Demo
cratic Legislature might prescribe as a test a belief
in the 16 to 1 theory and a Republican Legislature
faith in a high tariff was sufficient to show the dan
gerous character of the idea and indicate that it
might be used by partisans to the disadvantage of
the people.
These remarks seem to have had the desired effect
upon Senator Stratton. He has omitted the test
entirely from the new law, requiring only that the
voter shall swear to membership of the party with
which he desires to act. It is difficult now to predict
how this rule is going to operate. A reasonable test
would, perhaps, have prevented much prospective
fraud at primaries, and it may be that the failure
practically to prescribe any will nullify the good in
tent of the statute altogether; but, as with the other
questions presented, only a practical trial of the sys
tem will demonstrate its strength and weakness.
So after all the main question is whether the people
will care to vote at primary elections. The political
bosses capture conventions, nominate candidates and
control patronage through the indifference of the
masses to their civic duties. Does any one believe for
a moment that if every man in San Francisco at
tended as conscientiously to his election responsibili
ties â¢as he does .to his private business corrupt
Supervisors, boodle School Directors and incompe
tent and dishonest officials would be elected? If,
then, the present debased condition 1 of politics is due
to the failure of the people to attend to their duties
as citizens, how is a change to be worked by a law
which merely makes their indifference more disas
troi s?
The new primary law is an experiment, and as such
it should be given a full and fair trial. Its purpose is
to strengthen party organization, and in this respect
it will correct a most disheartening tendency in the
Australian ballot system, namely, a tendency to mul
tiply "piece" clubs and elevate to the dignity of
"parties" all sorts of committees appointed by sore
head politicians solely to defeat the regular candi
dates. One thing, however, may be regarded as set
tled before this statute is even given a trial. If the
people do not go to the polls and vote for delegates
to conventions the politicians will have them more
firmly imprisoned than ever, for none but regular par
ties can under the statute appear with a designation
upon the official ballot. . yy';iy
Prophets of evil have predicted that at some future
day San Francisco would drop into the sea. When
this shall occur Seattle will have a better chance to
become headquarters for transportation to the Phil
ippines. Until then it must wait with such patience as
it can summon up.
AN EASTERN DELUSION.
C* EVERAL times of late we have had occasion to
SEVERAL to the persistency occasion to
direct attention to the persistency with which
*-â *' the press of Boston, New York and Philadel
phia reiterate the statements that there is ; an over
supply of capital in the United States, that there are
no longer opportunities for its profitable use at home
and that our capitalists must seek investments abroad.
. The New York Commercial Advertiser is the la
test offender in that unreflecting way. In commenting
recently upon the proposed establishment of cotton
mills in Venezuela by American capital it said:
"The United States has reached a stage of industrial
development where British example in this respect is
forcing itself on American attention. American capi
tal has become so abundant and American production
has so outstripped domestic consumption that new
/fields of enterprise are imperative. This is the mean
ing of the project for cotton mills in Venezuela. It
[ is a case of necessity." V.?V
The error contained in that statement is so vast that
its acceptance by the capitalists and the press of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1899.
East can be accounted for only upon the theory that
the public mind of that section is subject to an im
mense delusion. British capitalists can afford to send
their capital abroad because they manufacture at home
all the raw material produced there, and, indeed, a
great deal that is not produced there, but America has
not yet reached that stage by a long way.
Why should we send out our capital to manufac
ture raw material in other lands when we do not
manufacture what we produce in our own country?
We" are sending large quantities of raw fruit to
Europe and importing large quantities of fruit pre
serves and confections of all kinds. Why should we
not work up at home our fruit to its highest form
and ship it in that shape to Europe? Why, in fact,
â¢should we export any kind ,'of. raw material if we
have capital enough to manufacture it all?
That there is a glut of money in the Eastern centers
is not to be denied since all authorities there agree
upon that point. The country around Boston, New
York and Philadelphia, however, is not the whole of
the United States by any means. There are abundant
opportunities for the profitable investment of capital
over the whole vast region lying west of the Missis
sippi and south of the Potomac. If the Eastern peo
ple could recover from their delusion and see things as
they are they would perceive at once that there are
larger opportunities open for capital in any one of our
Pacific States than there are in Venezuela, and that
it would be better for us to manufacture our own raw
material before we go abroad to work on that of
other folks.
IN referring to various proposed measures for the
relief of the Supreme Court, through amend
ments to the State constitution, The Call men
tioned one evil affecting all the courts, whether of
original or of appellate jurisdiction, that needed
separate treatment That evil is the enormous de
velopment of records. Before the codes were adopted
or official reporters had taken the autocratic relation
to the administration of justice that they now hold
the points of exception in the trial of a cause were
briefly expressed at the very time they were made and
the bills of exception immediately signed by the
Judge. Now each case is officially reported and the
elimination of immaterial or argumentative matter is
left to the discrimination of the reporter. When a
motion for new trial is made a transcript from his
notes is usually required, and charged for by the folio.
In the preparation of statements or bills of excep
tion the rule of late has been virtually to adopt the
transcript, the testimony in which is often but not al
ways reduced to narrative form, and the work has
become chiefly mechanical or automatic, and is com
monly performed by clerks. The result is, as we have
heretofore pointed out, that the labor which ought to
devolve on the bar is largely transferred to the bench,
and that it is a very small case that, by the time it
reaches the Supreme Court, does not contain a drop
sical record that needs tapping before its solid con
tents can be reached. In the Federal courts the
situation is worse, for there the principal object of
the law appears to be to fill the pockets of clerks, re
porters and printers.
These facts entail almost prohibitory expenses upon
litigants, except in very heavy controversies, and pro
duce inexactness and confusion in the practice and in
the administration of the law. In courts of original
jurisdiction the jury have to depend upon their own
recollections of the evidence, and, in the enlarging
number of cases in which juries are dispensed with,
there is no valid reason why qualified Judges should
not be required to rely on their own notes. Instead of
this directness and simplicity, which only demands com
petency and industry, it is the fashion to take nearly
all cases under advisement and to have the short
hand notes written out, so that the labor of trials is
practically duplicated and the judicial mind immersed
in a turgid mass of irrelevancies and immaterialities
from which it must extract the salient elements for
decision. When the inevitable motion for new trial
comes all this labor has to be performed again, and,
on the appeal, when transcription and typewriting
have ceased, the printer reproduces the tangled ac
cumulation until the Judges groan as they expend a
hundred dollars' worth of energy and research to
produce a dollar's worth of justice.
These are scanty illustrations of the overloaded con
ditions of the law within our. courts, due partly to
political legislation for the creation and support of
supernumeraries and partly to our yearly deluge of
legal fledgelings, which in the driest season never fails.
The theory of our system is that justice should be
swift, cheap and exact. In this State it is precisely
the reverse. From the commencement- of a lawsuit
to the end each step is accompanied by "every ele
ment of cost, delay and inartistic technicality that the
ingenuity of indolence could invent. From the ad
mission of the State to the present year the Legisla
ture has contained men whose interests were to in
crease the volume and retard the progress of litiga
tion, and each session has been besieged by Court
house lobbies, whose energies were bent upon the
multiplication of methods to extract money from the
people, without rendering an equivalent. The bane of
California from the first has been the unnatural pro
portion of scheming politicians interlaced by the com
mon desire to extract an easy livelihood from the in
dustrious and producing classes, until almost every
man of energy and of strength has had to carry at
least another man on his back. The public welfare is
j as unknown a quantity in the making and in the ad
: ministration of our laws as the public honor is in the
! deadlock at Sacramento.
It is the system, or lack of system, not the courts,
that is to blame, and, while it is indispensable, even by
an extemporized method, if no better way can be
found, immediately to relieve the congestion of the
Supreme Court, it is equally necessary that our best
legal minds, who have some desire to connect them
selves with posterity, should initiate a larger reform,
that will embrace the entire judiciary, the laws they
are called upon to apply and the officers by whom
they are assisted. In other States, and especially in
Great Britain under its recent legislation, rapid strides
have been made toward simplicity, uniformity and
promptness in the enforcement of rights and in the
redress of wrongs. It is full time for California to
awaken from its Rip Van Winkle slumber and real
ize, that, in this as in other respects, it must place
itself abreast of the times.
Morehouse seems to have relented. He does not
thirst for editorial gore as once he did. After all, the
slaying of editors would be dangerous amusement.
The gentleman would find the hunting of ducks more
conducive to health.
There is no use in being overcome with terror at
the expenditures of Congress. There are in this
country half a dozen men who could together foot
the bill and have enough left to be certain of three
meals a day.
South American republics intimate that they do not
desire to be absorbed by the United States, and as
this country has not the slightest desire to absorb
them, there ought to be good feeling all around.

SUBJECT TO OFFICERS.
Many Recruits Arriving at the Pre

Yesterday.
The adjutant general of the department
was officially notified that the Ninth In
fantry left Madison barracks, New York,
on Tuesday morning for San Francisco.
The regiment will arrive here about the
last of this week or the first of next. It
is commanded by Colonel William 11.
Powell and during the last war won for
itself an honorable record in Cuba, par
ticipating in the Santiago campaign. An
erroneous idea was disseminated through
th. medium of the afternoon press to the
effect that the Ninth is coming here to
be sent to the Philippines. This is denied
by the officers at department headquar
ters. The regiment comes here to take
the place of the First Infantry and to do
garrison duty on this coast. Four com
panies go to the Presidio, two to Van
couver barracks headquarters and two
companies to Angel Island, one company
to Benicia, while the other company is yet
to be assigned.
The advent of the Ninth to the Presidio
and the surrounding posts in the harbor
will have the effect of stirring up the
social life of the garrison and there is no
doubt that the officers of the Ninth and
their families, since they come here to
make San Francisco their home, will be
accorded a royal welcome by the citizens
of this city.
The new army bill as just passed by
Congress has thrown all the officers of
this department into a sea of speculation.
None of them seem to exactly understand
it clearly, and they are waiting for the
full text from Washington with such ex
planations as the War Department will
send. â¢â "â 
The matter of promotion under the new
bill is the question of greatest interest
to the regular army officers and they are
not certain as to how its provisions will
affect them. Some will be, of course, pro
moted, while others will be affected by a
reduction of pay.
One of the officers who will be promoted
is First Lieutenant David J. Rumbough,
now stationed at the Presidio, lie will
become a captain. His promotion will
give general satisfaction, as he is one of
the best known and most popular offi
cers serving here. He was appointed to
the Military Academy in 1876 from Vir
ginia and graduated four years later. He
has seen constant service in the Third Ar
tillery and, besides, is a graduate of the
School of Artillery. By his efficiency he
has won the highest respect of all of his
superior officers. Major David H. Kin
zie of the Third Artillery is another who
will be promoted. He will be made a lieu
tenant colonel and in all probability will
go to some other regiment.
Since the Presidio has been the receiv
ing station for all recruits they are gath
ering there every day from all parts of
the country. There are now at this sta
tion over 150 of these soldiers. They have
all been carefully vaccinated.
Bids were opened yesterday noon for
the transportation of 7600 tons of miscel
laneous stores to Manila. Uncle Sam Is

Bird of the transportation bureau of the
War Department as follows: "We are
asking for bids for 7000 tons of freight
now stored at San Francisco. If British
ship-owners offer the cheapest rate they
will get the contract for transporting
this freight to Manila. If they bid the
same as American owners the American
ships will be given the preference."

the animal tissues from decomposition

CALIFOBNIANS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON. March 8. â Joaquin j
Miller, California's eccentric poet, called >
at the White House to see President Mc-
Kinley to-day. He said this was his first
visit to Washington in fifteen years.
Miller had with him an enormous gold
nugget, which he took from a Klondike
claim. He was accompanied to the
White House by the Hoosler poet, James
Whltcomb Riley.
Senator Perkins left for California this
morning, several days sooner than he ex
pected. Representative De Vries also
left for home to-day. Mrs. E. F. Loud i
will make a trip to Europe this summer.
THE POPULIST CONFLICT.
Charges Preferred Against Dr. Gris
wold, George A. Clough and
Garrett W. Smith.
The latest development in the. troubles
of the Populists is a communication tothe
i officers and members of the county com
mittee of that political organization pre
ferring charges against Dr. W. N. Gris
wold, George A. Clough and Garrett W.
Smith. These three members of the Peo
ple's party are accused of circulating and
promulgating false and misleading state
ments regarding the conduct and manage
ment of the last campaign, scandalizing
the members, disgracing the party and
stirring up discord and strife.
The principal offense of the three per
sons was saying that the purity of elec
tions committee of the People's party had
corruptly disbursed money intrusted to
Its care and that its members were conse
quently guilty of felony.
Accompanying the communication con
taining the charges is a copy of the
adopted minority report of the executive
committee, which on February 14, 1899 in
vestigated the purity of elections commit
tee. In this minority report is an item
ized statement of the campaign funds
amounting to $1987 57, with receipts and
expenditures, followed by a statement
that the executive committee found the
accounts of the purity of elections com
| mittee correct and proper in every partic
ular, and that said committee discharged
its duty in a perfectly honest and satis
factory manner.
Extreme Cruelty Charged.
Officer McCurry of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
sworn to a complaint charging Louis &
Kraeke of 133 Henry street with cruelly
to animals. -Kraeke manages the City
Transfer Company's business at 311 Bush
street. The cruelty complained of is that
starves his horses so that they are
unfit for work. In fact, It is alleged that
he has starved one horse to death, the
poor beast dying of hunger a few nights
ago. On Tuesday night he was found
driving one animal that was so sick It
could hardly stand, the other horse prac
tically dragging its helpless companion
along the streets.

GOLF LINKS
"HOODOOED" BY
BUTCHER KLEIN
The . "Hoot Mons"
Under a Spell.
>Â»â *
HOBNAIL SHOES OSTRACIZED
PRIVATE CADDIES CAUSE A
BLUE LAW.
A Lady Member Claims Her Son Is
Persecuted and Makes Things
Interesting- for a Brief
Period.
"Butcher Klein has been a 'hoodoo' to
the San Rafael golf links-there can be no
doubt of that. Ever since we had the
trouble with him over the pungent odor
emanating from his sausage factory
something or other has gone wrong. The
â¢hoodoo' began with the filing of an Infor
mation in the Federal courts against the
club for the sale of liquor without a li
cense, gained full force with the strike of
the caddies, then manifested itself in a
heated quarrel over the wearing of, hobnail
shces. and has now reached a stag? where
[a leading lady member declares her son
is persecuted. There have been numerous
clashes, and the result will probably be
several resignations. All of us are on
' edge in expectation of the next manifes
tation of the 'hoodoo.' "
The speaker, a prominent member of
the club in question, formed the center of
an rested group of auditors in the ro
tunda of the Palace Hotel las evening.
In response to inquiries for details he .took
another puff at his cigar and resumed his
tale.
'Well, you all know about the liquor
trouble and how it w_ settled. It was
! shortly after that that the caddies struck
because they were paid only 15 cents a
round. Some of the members had been
in the habit of giving them a quarter
and sometimes more. Well, the little
devils knew the men who adhered to the
rules, and every time one of them up
peared they all took to the brush, leaving
the boycotted players to wander around
all day without caddies. The golf council
has lately settled that disturbance by de
creeing that any member paying more
than 15 cents shall be lined not to exceed
$:_> for the first offense. In addition, we
have had to place a badge on the caddies,
and they are obliged to serve in rotation
according to their numbers.
"There were a few of the players who
wore hobnail shoos, and these shoes were
injuring the floor of the new clubhouse.
[ A rule was adopted and pasted up con
spicuously requiring that hobnail shoes
be discarded. All respected the order but
one young fellow, whose mother is the
'leading member' referred to. lb- contin
ued to wear them and had to be called
down by one of the directors. Then he
told his mother, and she raised a row on
the ground that the rule was aimed at
her son and nobody else, but the shoes
were discarded nevertheless.
"Then came the private caddies. Some
of tho more opulent members took to
bringing boys not among the original
twenty and paying them as they liked.
This caused a threat of another strike,
and a rule was adopted proscribing tho
private, caddie system. The same young
gentleman that made trouble over the
hobnail shoes came one day with a private
caddy decked out in a manner that would
put a Highland caddie to shame. He was
gently but firmly told he would have to
conform to the rule. He carried his
troubles home and then came the rumpus.
"The lady brought her son up one day
with a private caddie and set him to play
ing. One of the directors made a chance
remark to the lady in question and site
berated him in unmeasured terms and de
clared a scheme was on foot to persecute
her boy. She asserted that she had come
to witness fair play and intended to have
',%. Her son and his private caddie were
there to stay, and she would like to see
anybody put them off while she was
there. She was given a clear field.
"Now the council will hold a special
meeting to consider the question, and I ;
understand that until the fTffair is settled
a Constable or two will be kept on the
grounds to see that the rules are en
forced. I think there will be several res
ignations before peace is restored."

SLAPPED THE BUNKO CHAP.
Clarence Berry Gets Rid of a Confi-
dence Man at the Lick.
One of the bunko men who have lately
1 been working the hotels came to grief
Tuesday afternoon in the Lick House,
and he will no doubt give that caravan
sary a wide berth in the future. Clarence
Berry, who is well known from his exten
sive holdings in the Yukon mining dis
trict, was standing with his two brothers
i in the lobby of the hotel, when he was ac
; costed by one of the "sure, thing" gentry.
The stranger claimed an acquaintance
i which had developed in the Klondike
j countrj', from which he said he had just
i returned. Berry remembered that he had
1 spoken with the same individual only
I three weeks before. Realizing that the
. man was lying and sizing him up for
; what he really was, Berry drew back and
\ administered a slap in the face of
j the luckless fraud that sent him scurrying
' off as fast as his legs would carry him,
j besides waking up the habitues of the
: place from their peaceful afternoon slum
bers.
Berry does not think that the man Is
running yet, but he is inclined to the
! opinion that he will not be annoyed by
: the members of his ilk for some time to
; come.

Steeplechaseâ the Rider
of Lord Chesterfield,
Suspended.
Favored by circumstances. Sardine, the
fast Corrigan filly, placed the Ocean View
; stakes to the credit of the Maistre of In
' gleside yesterday. Kitty Kelly, the out
| sider in the betting, was best, but ran out
â¢ at the stretch turn with Thorpe and lost
out by a short neck. The winner, ridden
by Henry Martin, closed a 3 to 5 favorite
in the ring. The Marcus Daly pair, Ella
Boland and Mortgage, had a strong fol
lowing. After racing head and head with
Sardine to the stretch Ella Boland gave It
up, and her stable companion, away none
too well, was never prominent.
The talent experienced a very squally
afternoon of it. Joe Ullman, Lord Chester
field and Survivor, all hot favorites, hav
ing their colors lowered.
The surprise of the day was the capture
of tho mile handicap by Joe Mussle, once
30 to 1 in the betting, ridden by the colored
lad, Basslnger. Pat Dunne's Survivor was
the post favorite, but went the overland
and was led over the line two lengths by
the outsider.
The short course steeplechase proved
replete with incidents and accidents, dual
ly resulting in Corrigan's Tyro getting the
purse, against which, coupled with van
ity. 10 to 1 was laid. At the fifth jump
Cairns, on the favorite. Lord Chesterfield,
managed to let his mount run out, and a
barrel of coin went up in smoke. Monita
fell at the same obstacle, knocking Trim
lfto completely out for some minutes. Our
Climate, ridden by Frank Doane, came to
grief at the first piece of brush. Tyro, in
front all tho way, Â»won cased up from
Reno.
Of the original large number of entries
in the first event, a five-furlong scramble,
eleven faced the barrier. The Baldwin
entry. El Salado, with Devin up, closed a
6 to 5 favorite. The flying mare, Flora
Hawk, second choice in the betting, nearly
made a runaway race of it. Losing the
field the first part, she backed up Badly
at the end, allowing the favorite to get up
and win by a short head in fast time.
The finish to the mile selling run that
followed was a very close and exciting
one, Cromwell, Joe Uliman and Opponent
finishing short heads apart on the wire in
the order mentioned. The field was a
large one and raced well bunched to the
stretch, where Opponent showed first. At
the paddock the favorite, Ullman, looked
to be winning, hut was caught the last
few jumps by Cromwell, with Bullman up,
which made a great run from the rear.
The winner was 5 to 1 in the betting.

checks down on Carter H. Harrison Jr., a

Walter B. Bryant, a young man from
Springfield, Mass., is here, negotiating for
the purchase of some desirable racing
; stock. He is looking only for bread-win
i ners, and Is a welcome addition to the
! turf.
Tommy Murphy, "the man who plated
Rey El Santa Anita for the Derby," is
' going down the grand circuit this year
with Tommy Keating and his string of
[ equine stars. Tom is the best in the busi
ness at turning out platers, and if Search

Bob Cairns, the rider of Lord Chester

day night, at the meeting of the stew
ards, he can appear before the grand tri
bunal and tell them why.
Rathbone, who rode Tyro, was recog
-1 nixed as one of the best steeplechase rid
' ers in Australia, from all accounts. His
debut here is certainly a success.
Johnny Coleman went to 7 to 5 to show
I against 'Reno, and if tho tip had not tray
eled the rounds that the jumper was dead,
the Easterner might have had a line be
hind his box after the race.
Tully Coulter, the well-known trainer

The stranger with whom Ed Corrigan
had the altercation at the track on
Tuesday is paid to he a Deputy Sheriff
of the city across the bay. Friends of his
say that nobody ever stepped on nis

turned.
Young Dcvin is riding in good form

SHEEP WEEE NOT BOUGHT.
Christian Kleine Accused of Obtain-
ing Money by False
Pretenses.
John TV. Hansborough yesterday swore
to a complaint in Judge Mogan's court for
the arrest of Christian Kleine on the fel-
ony charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses.
In the complaint It is alleged that No-
vember 5 last Kleine, while manager of
the Marin County Packing and Provision
Company, informed Charles Alpers. treas-
urer of the company, that he had pur- j
chased from W. F. McAllister 600 sheep !
for $550 cash. He was handed a check for !
the amount, payable to order, and pro- i
cured McAllister's indorsement thereon.
The company later found that the state-
ments made to Alpers by Kleine were '
false, as he had not purchased the sheep
from McAllister, and got McAllister's in-
dorsement to the check with the intent
to cheat and defraud the company.

DR. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
HOW TO MD OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with
your water ancj let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment or settling indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys;
if it stains your linen it is evidence of
kidney trouble; too frequent desire to
pass it or pain in the back is also con-
vincing proof that the kidneys and
bladder are out of order.
WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp- Root, the great kidney remedy,
fulfills every wish in curing rheuma-
tism, pain in the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold
water and scalding pain in passing it,
or bad effects following use of liquor,
wine or beer, and overcomes that un-
pleasant necessity of being compelled
to go often during the day, and to get
up many times during the night. The
mild and the extraordinary effect of
3wamp-Rcot is soon realized. It stands
the highest for its wonderful cures of
Lhe most distressing cases. If you need
a medicine you should have he best.
Sold by druggists in fifty-cent and one-
â¢Jollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottle of this
wonderful discovery and a book that
tells more about it, both sent absolutely-
free by mail, address Dr. Kilmer & Co.,
Binghamton. N. Y. When writing
mention that you read this generous
r-.ffer in the San Francisco Daily Call.

OUR IMMENSE TRADE.
American manufacturers seem likely to make
their greatest record in the fiscal year which
Ends four mopths hence. The reports of the
Treasury Bureau of Statistics covering seven
months of the fiscal year show that the ex
portation of domestic manufactures is $23,
--500,000 greater than the highest record ever be
fore made in the corresponding months of the
fiscal year. During the seven months ended
February I, 1899, the exports of domestic man
ufactures amounted- to $182,336,503, or an aver
age of $1,000,000 a lay for every business day of
that period. Not only are the manufacturers
Increasing their sales in foreign markets, but
they are evidently supplying to a greater ex
tent than ever before the home market. The,
Imports of manufactures In the seven months
under consideration amount to only $147,200,972,
cr $35,000,000 less than the manufactures ex
ported. The exports of manufactures during
[he past seven months have been nearly 25 per
rent greater than the imports of manufactures.
Comparing conditions with those of a decade
ago, the evidence of gain by our manufacturers
Is even more striking. In the seven months
ended February 1. 1889, our exports of manu
factures were $78,751,933; In the seven months
tnded February 1. 1*99, they were $182,336,503,
in increase of 131 per cent. Or. the other hand,
Imports of manufactures In the decade have
fallen 2.*! per cent, despite the fact that the
consuming population has meantime Increased
25 per cent. The imports of manufactures In
ihe seven months ended February 1, 1899, were
$194,996,778, against $148,300,972 the correspond
ing seven months ended February 1, 1899.
THE HAY MARKET.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"A ireful study of the hay market at the
present time shows a peculiar and rather un
interesting state of affairs. It is a well estab
lished fact that the weather has great influ
ence over all produce markets, an excellent ex
ample of which is being demonstrated on the
San Francisco Produce Exchange at the pres
ent time with grain, more particularly barley,
which is perhaps more especially a cereal of
local production and Interest. With every cloud
barley futures weaken, and we find the market
a particularly sensitive one.
'This is always a critical season of the year
and one would naturally think that with the
continued dry weather and rather discouraging
crop prospects hay (as well as all kinds
of grain) mid be stiffening in price daily,
but the converse of this has been true.
"Hay has been coming to market slowly. 1650
tons for the last six days ending to-day, a rath
er light, supply. The explanation of the con
tinued Sepression is simply that light as the
supply has been the demand has been still
lighter. A good rain may Inprove nude by
Inspiring confidence, etc.. hut will encourage
the farmers to let go their holdings. To sum
up the situation, we give it as our opinion that
If we have rain immediately prices will weaken
some: if it continues dry we will probably
see hay go no lower, but may look for the
market to be regulated from day to day, ac
cording to tht receipts and the demand.
"Ordinarily we would state that dry weather
would cause hay to jump, but the poor con
dition of trade here seems to militate fcgalnst
any advance in prices."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March The stock market
was dull most of the day.except at the closing,
when there was considerable activity. The
interest largely centered ln the coalers, which
made some handsome advances, and a number
of the specialties went up over a point, while
fractional advances were the rule in many
other stocks. The published report of a com
bination of practically all the coalers wae the
ground for the strength ln those properties.
Much interest attached to the declaration of
the regular dividend - in Sugar. The market
waited until it was announced and then mod
erate activity appeared. Sugar, after opening
higher ar.d -then losing more than the earlier
gain, rose about 4 points for the day. The
large payment which the Government was to
make to the Southern Pacific on the claim al
lowed by Congress lent strength to that prop
erty. The stagnation which prevailed the
greater part of the session, with fluctuations of
only % or so, was dispelled in the final deal
ings, when the coalers were marked up and
there were sympathetic rises elsewhere. Lack
awanna and Reading first preferred led the
coalers with an advance of 3 points each.
Among the standard stocks St. Paul gained a
point.
Bonds were very active at a higher level for
the leading issues. Total sales, $4,600,000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March B.â The weight of accu
mulating stocks at a season when they ought
to be diminishing made wheat weak from the

j the world's visible stocks to be 11,000,000
' bushels larger than a year ago and 5,500,000
bushels more than at the beginning of Feb
ruary. May opened %c lower at 71%@71%c
and made a decline of %Â®%c inside the next
minute. Liverpool and foreign markets ruled
weak at a sharp decline. A dispatch from
Buenos Ayres denied that serious damage had
been done in wheat in Argentine by the heavy
rains, claiming that wheat was for the most
part under shelter. Liquidation became gen
eral and May slipped off to 70% c. Some cov
ering of short wheat causad a slight temporary
rise. The price soon had another slump,
which took It as low as 70% c. Advices from
i California said that' the crop In the southern
valleys had been completely burned up. The
I market firmed up a little on that, May recov
! ering to 70% c. Just at the end of the session
I a message was received from San Francisco
saying it looked like rain. That caused more
I selling and a further decline to 70% c, the clos
| Ing figure being 70%Â®70%c.
Light offering strengthened corn. There was
: very little pressure on the market. May left

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, March 8.- The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
I market is very quiet. But few manufacturers
i have been In and they have purchased very |
sparingly. The sales of heavy-weight goods I
have thus far been disappointing, and falling â 
to receive the orders which they anticipated i
! earlier In the season they naturally felt disin
; clined to buy very' liberally of wool. The dull
ness is also intensified by the announcement ;
j of the formation of the worsted trust, which '
I has been the all-absorbing topic of conversa
tion In manufacturing circles and in the wool
trade.
Prices are generally unchanged, although
dealers show more disposition to meet the view
of manufacturers.
The sales of the week in Boston amounted
to 2.612.000 pounds domestic and 710,000 foreign, I
â  making a total of 3.322 against a total of I
' 3.263,000 fo rthe previous week and a total of |
1.237,000 for the corresponding week last year.
': Sales since January 1. 1899. amount to 36,802.
--500 pounds, against 36,019,480 last year at this
time.
LONDON WOOD SALES.
LONDON, March 8. â The second day's ses- |
I sion of the present series of the wool auction

: and a better selection than that offered yester
j day. Medium low stock ruled Irregular. Shabby
I stocks showed a drooping tendency and sold I
110 cer cent lower. Scoured merinos were j
j eagerly bid for by the Gorman and Yorkshire \
! buyers at hardening rates. Victoria greasy j
merinos were well represented and sold readily
to France and Germany. Lamps were well
represented and were strongly competed for.

PLIGHT OF MAYOR PHELAN
Plans for Perpetuating Himself in Office Shattered by
the Newly Adopted Compulsory Primary
Election Law.
Democrats Eager for the Opportunity to Use Their Knives
on Him and the Committee of One Hundred
That Backed Him.
MUCH of the Joy brought to Mayor i
Phelan by the adoption of the new
charter has changed to sadness j
within the past few days, say the
politicians who carefully study every
move on the local political chessboard. I
That Instrument, with all its manifold j
advantages as a political stepping stone,
has become a veritable apple of Sodom, j
so far as Phelan is concerned. It has j
been turned to "ashes on the lips" by the
enactment of the Stratton primary law.
It is a matter of common notoriety that
the city's hefting expert has heretofore J
considered that he had a first mortgage'
on the mayoralty, for the first term at
least after the new charter went into ope- |
ration. His confidence was largely based
upon the fact that he felt assured of the';
support of the Non-Partisans, and he ex- j
pected that he would be again able to
use that organization to force his nomi- ;
nation for Mayor upon the local Democ
racy. The plan was to havo the Non-
Partisans first take him up as their can
didate for Mayor. Such action on their
part, it was believed, would compel the
machine Democrats to fall in line be
hind Phelan, even though he might be
distasteful to many of them, as well as I
to the ordinary voter.
It is a matter of comment among in
fluential Democrats that Phelan's plans
have gone so far as to inaugurate a move
ment among the Non-Partisans, with
whom his brother-in-law, Frank J. Sulli
van, is closely allied, for the reorganiza
tion of that body on a broader and
stronger basis. The new organization, I
so the story goes, is to be known as the
Municipal League, and is to have the sup
port of many of the members of the Mer
chants' Association.
But the Stratton primary law has been I
passed, and things are different now.
Neither Non-Partis nor machine Dem
ocrats now see their way clear to "de
livering the goods." Delegates to nomi- <
nating conventions must be chosen at
primaries held under the Australian sys
tem. No self-constituted committee of
one hundred alleged Democrats can as- '
SCHOOL BOARD
HOLDS A VERY
BUSY SESSION
Attention Given to
Many Matters.
At its regular monthly meeting last \
evening the Board of Education made no ;
move toward further economy by lopping j
off the heads and salaries of teachers in ;
the department, and every one breathed \
easier when It adjourned. The meeting
was one of the quietest and most' busi
ness-like held for some time. The mem
bers did not go into executive session, as
the various recommendations and deci
sions were settled the night before, when
the different committees met.
Only once during the session did the
proceedings attain any degree of excite
ment. It was upon the introduction of a
resolution by Chairman Brandenstein of
the committee on qualifications. Under
the resolution special teachers in the de
partment would at the annual examina
tion held on March 24 be compelled to
take the examination and take out a spe
cial certificate in the branch she was
teaching.
Directors Head and Gedge opposed its
passage and the latter moved that the
resolution be laid on the table. On a vote
being taken the result was 6 to 6.. In the
hurry to complete their business no fur
ther action was taken on the resolution,
which read as follows:
Resolved That all teachers in the Pan Fran
cisco School Department ling regular teach
es" certificates, but engaged in teaching spe
cial subjects, without special certificates en
titling them to teach such special subjects,
must secure necessary special certificates at the
regular semi-annual examination of teachers
commencing March 24, 1899.
The board modified its rule that a pri
mary school must have fifteen classes
In order to be entitled to a vice principal
by reducing the limit to fourteen, lhe

A.' communication was received from
Rose M Stack demanding her salary as
assistant teacher ln the Buena Vista Pri
mary School for the month of February,
1899, amounting to $50. .
Ida Clayton Carman, formerly Ida
M Clayton, tendered her resignation as
assistant teacher in the Redding School.
Miss M R. Carew gave notice to the
board that she had been appointed to the
GBAPE-NUTS.

Any man or woman who cares to
' make a test by using Grape-Nuts for a
portion of one or two meals each day,
will find a distinct increase in vigor,
and particularly in brain power. Then
if they feel disposed to know the rea-
son why, they can have Grape-Nuts an-
alyzed, and the result will show that
the food contains the natural phos-
phate of potash obtained in a natural
way from the cereals, and albumen ob-
tained in the same way. These two
elements unite together in the human
body to make and rebuild the gray mat-
ter of which the brain, solar plexus and
nerve centers are filled.
These are scientific facts which can
be ascertained by any careful investi-
gator. The food Grape-Nuts, is not
only the most scientifically made food
in the world, but almost any user will
agree with us that the flavor is unique
and moat winning.
surne control of the party organization
and its bone and sinew by arbitrary ac
tion, nor can any body of men create a
party convention without submitting to
the arbitrament of a primary. The rank
and file of the voters must be given an
opportunity to express themselves. â¢
Among the active, loyal Democrats this
condition of things is a source of great
gratification. They see their way clear
to taking their revenge on Phelan s ob
noxious Committee of One Hundred. They
declare that if the Democrats of San
Francisco obtain the opportunity to ex
press themselves fairly .as to their prefer
ences for candidates in tho forthcoming
election Phelan's votes in the nominating
convention will go into the "scattering
column. Knives are out for him in every
direction. He is charged with breaking
pledges and promises as if they were of
no more value than so many bubbles. In
making bis combinations during the last
campaign it is stated that Charlie Fay,
popularly known as Icewater Charley, or
some other third person, was his go-be
tween, and when an arrangement did not
suit his Honor after the election he
showed no hesitation in repudiating it,
casting the responsibility upon his inter
mediary.
When the announcement was made that
the Non-Partisans had determined to con
test the validity of the primary law much
surprise was occasioned. It was gen
erally presumed that they would be the
lirst "to give such a law their earnest and
united support. Those who can see
through a political millstone when there
is a hole in it now assert that the Phelan
cause was seen to be in danger through
the compulsory primaries. If they ab
jured the primaries the Non-Partisans
would simply become an Indorsing con
vention and would lose all the power and
prestige that accompanies the appearance
cf the party designation on the official
ballots. Hence the prompt determination
to take action to have the primary law
annulled.
As matters now stand Phelan will be
compelled to make his fight at the pri
maries, where, the indications are, he will
have to meet such adversaries as Colonel
James F. Smith of the Fighting First of
California or Assessor Dodge, or possibly
both.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI^I^, THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1899.
COLONEL J. E. SLINKEY'S
MYSTERIOUS ACCUSER
She Is Miss May Lynch of This City
and Was Inspired by Jealousy.
Colonel J. E. Blinkey has at last learned who wrote the anonymous
letter to Coroner Hill alleging that the late Mrs. Slinkey died of poison,
and that the colonel was cognizant of this fact at the time. The colonel,
assisted by his old-time friend and fraternal brother. Captain P. W. How
ell, has been persistently hunting the unknown writer.
Coroner Hill attached no value to the mysterious communication, but
feeling that it was his official duty to make a careful investigation, did
so and found that his nameless correspondent was the flattest of fakers.
The letter could only have been inspired by some description of illogical
jealousy, and this established the sex of the writer. Here the detectives
struck their first snag, because the gallant colonel had lady friends in
many counties.
But Captain Howell and Colonel Slinkey continued the mystery to ex
plore. The captain was no slouch among the fair sex. and from long ex
perience had achieved a knowledge of the devious ways of the female
heart. The captain swore that he would never rest until he had unearthed
that writer and completely cleared his friend from the foul charge.
They do not appear to have unearthed anything, but the Coroner did.
He learned that a Miss May Lynch of this city, an Intimate friend of
both gentlemen, was the writer. Coroner Hill sent for her. and when she
responded after several days she was accompanied by no less a body
guard than Captain Howell. During the rather animated conversation
between the two in the Coroner's office it seemed to that official that the
captain had not met the lady that day for the first time. It also looked as
if the captain hadn't been very far away when the letter was inspired.
This was a little mystery on the side. However, Miss Lynch accused the
captain there of having persuaded her to disregard the Coroner's request
for four days, and that she had come against his will, having shaken
herself free from his Svengali-like glare long enough to board a car. The
captain, when he found that his Trilby had knocked out the spell, fol
lowed her to the Coroner's office.
During the visit Captain Howell waxed reminiscent over the part
played by the Old Friends in the last campaign. He said Colonel Slinkey
made a piece-club of the order and dragged considerable contribution out
of several candidates.
"Patton," continued the captain, "very correctly attributed his defeat
to the fact that Phelan gave $25 to the order. However, O'Donnell pun
gled up his $25 and was smashed. But nothing could save O'Donnell. I
tell you, Doc, I'll have nothing more to do with the Old Friends. Slinkey
pulling candidates' legs lets me out." Even Miss Lynch appeared to
have knowledge of alleged shortcomings of the members of the order and
condemned them by name severely.
Colonel Slinkey stated last evening that Miss Lynch. wrote the letter
through jealousy. He did not explain what caused that feeling, this be
ing a matter not for publication. However, Miss Lynch knows of a Mrs.
Curtis a friend of the colonel, and peradventure this knowledge inspired
the anonymous letter. But the colonel now knows that the captain did not
report all of his discoveries during the search for the mysterious writer,
and while they are brothers in the society of Old Friends, outside of the
lodgeroom harsh discord has got a good swipe at them.
MRS. C. BOTKIN
MAY SOON BE
A GRASS WIDOW
Husband Brings Suit
for Divorce.
Mrs Cordelia Botkln'a troubles are
many. Imprisoned for murder, she has
but few joys, and now her handicapped
wedded bliss Is to be taken from her. Yes
terday afternoon Melcom A. Botkin filed
suit for divorce from his notorious wife,
alleging as a cause of action that Mrs.
Botkin has been convicted of a felony.
Mr. Botkin refrained from Betting forth
in his complaint his wife's questionable
relations with John P. Dunning, husband
of the woman for whoso death Mrs. Bot
kin stands convicted and for which she in
all probability must do penal servitude
during her remaining days.
Mr. Botkin avers in the complaint that
he married Mrs. Botkin on September 26.
1872. December 30, ISMS, he continues, Mrs.
Botkin was convicted of the crime of
murder in the first degree, and on Febru
ary 4, 1899, was. sentenced to life impris
onment in the State prison at San Quen
tin. The issue of said marriage is one
son, Beverly Botkin. aged 26 years. Hence
the plaintiff asks that the bonds of mat
rimony now existing between himself and
Mrs. Botkin be dissolved.
A peculiar question of law arises from
this suit. Although Mrs. Botkin has been
convicted of a felony, and the statute
makes such a conviction grounds for a di
vorce, will the court grant the decree of
divorce on this ground prior to the deter
mination of the legality of the conviction
by the Supreme Court? ; â¢
Yesterday Mrs. Botkin s attorneys filed
their bill of exceptions to the judgment
heretofore entered In the Superior Court.
Judge Cook granted the District Attorney
twenty days in which to flle his proposed
amendments to the bill. When this is
done the matter will be carried to the
Supreme Court for final adjudication, and
in event the higher court orders judgment
suspended, which will practically kill the
effect of the conviction temporarily,
doubtless lengthy argument will follow
regarding the right of Botkin to secure
a divorce on the ground named, even
though no opposition is expected from
Mrs Botkin. If a new trial is granted
You Have a Pain,
maybe in your shoulder, or back or side;
at ' all events you want to get rid of it.
Did you ever try
Altoeeli&
Porous FjlasteiÂ£S
Do you know that we have hundreds "of
letters from all parts of the world telling
us of the wonderful cures these plasters
have made? Do you know that all other
so-called . porous plasters were started
after Allcock's had acquired their enor-
mous sales and world-wide reputation?
Do you know that none of them have the
medicinal properties of Allcock's? Just
put them to your nose and compare the
fine aromatic odor of Allcock's with the
smell of all others. Don't be deceivedâ
get the genuine article.
Mrs. Botkin the past conviction Is swept
aside and the ground is still wanting.
The final decision of the court is the only
thing which will set these matters at rest,
and It will be expectantly awaited.
Outside the Immediate suit of Mr. Bot
kin for a divorce. Interest divides with
that of Mrs. Clara Arbogast, one of the
most Important witnesses against the de
fendant murderess. Only a few days ago
Mrs. Arbogast secured a divorce from her
husband. Mrs. Arbogast was a conspic
uous figure in the Botkin trial, and it was
stated during- this case that Mrs. Botkin
had told Dunning that her husband want
ed to get rid of her that he might marry
Mrs. Arbogast. Mrs. Arbogast Is now
free and Botkin seeks his freedom. Will
they wed when time sufficient has passed
or are the stories told on the witness
stand based on fiction and not on fact?
A PURSE FOR MRS. LENNON.
Employes of the Sutro Line Aiding
the Bereaved Widow.
The many friends of Edward _ennon,
the motorman who lost his lire while fish-
Ing at the Cliff House last Tuesday, are
raising a purse to present to his widow
as a token of the high esteem ln which
he was held.
J. C. Cooper, a motorman, and Michael
O'Doherty, a conductor on the Sutro line,
are doing the active work of raising the
funds. The list was started with a hand
some donation from the company and all
the officers and employes have contrib
uted liberally. Contributions have also
been received from men working on other
lines and more are expected.
Mr. Lennon left a widow and two chil
dren, aged 3 and 5 years respectively, In
straitened circumstances.
Battered the Conductor.
P. F. Kelly and a friend got on a Geary
street car at Powell street on Tuesday
night. The friend had a nickel, but Kelly
pretended he was without a cent. That
gave him the opportunity to show his
friend how he could ride on a car without
paying his fare. When Conductor Ly
nagh asked Kelly for his fare he jumped
off the car and jumped on again on the
rear platform. When the conductor tried
to put him off there was a lively scrap,
and an old lady's screams attracted the
attention of the police. Judge Mogan
yesterday fined Kelly $20.

CLOSING OF
THE CAMPAIGN
IS WELCOME
Scanning Names on
the Ballot.
DOW MAKES EXPLANATION
IMPROVEMENT CLUBS MAKE
CHOICE OF CANDIDATES.
Choose a Councilman at Large From
the Center and From Each
Section of the
City. ;, --
" " Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 8.
Only -three days more are left to the
candidates In which to patch up the
â¢holes that "the other fellows" have made
ln their fences. This municipal campaign
has been a very desultory one. and seems
to have been held merely because there
is a precedent for holding a campaign
prior to every election.
The leading men on either ticket and
their stand on all matters regarding the
public were as well known at the last
city campaign as they are to-day. There
are no strangers before the voters and
had the election been held the day follow
ing the conventions the result would prob
ably have been the same as will be
reached next Monday. The most enthu
siastic friend of Mr. Snow will not sure
ly claim that during three weeks of so
called campaigning they have added one
particle to the honor of his record of j
ten years at the City Hull. Mr. Davie's
most ardent supporters cannot claim that :
their candidate is any better known to- I
day than when he was elected Mayor four
years ago. There is one good excuse,
however, for encouraging and enduring \
campaigns. They make work for print- :
ers, bill-posters, ball-owners and saloons, i
and cause the circulation of a large sum
of money, although the coin used prob- |
ably drives away as many votes as it I
purchases.
The alphabetical clause in the Austra
lian ballot law, while perfectly fair Is
less agreeable this time than ever be
fore. 'In a district so largely Republi- J
ran as this the Republicans naturally
would like to have their candidates in the ;
most conspicuous place on the ballot.
This is not the case. Mr. Snow is the
last of the five candidates for Mayor and
at the bottom of about two dozen candi- ;
dates for Councilmen at large is found |
another Republican candidate. The in- |
dividuals suffering from this disadvan
tage are consoling themselves with the
hope that the last will be first and the;
first last. There are 130 names on the ;
ballot and by to-morrow each voter will
have received his sample, so that to- I
morrow night, should the sample ballots j
be collected, Monday's result could be i
foretold. .V .
City Attorney Dow has Issued a state
ment concerning a car man who was dis
charged temporarily a few months ago,
which incident la being used in an at
tempt to hurt Mr. Dow's candidacy. It
appears that Mr. Dow reported a car
man for being disrespectful to him and
that the employe was laid off for a few
days. Mr. Dow afterward wrote to the
manager of the railroad requesting that
the employe be reinstated and that no
further notice be taken of the matter.
Mr. Dow considered he had good cause
to make his complaint, but showed a
magnanimous feeling toward the offen
der and has lost no votes by this at
tempt to injure him.
At a meeting of the directors of the
following improvement clubs held on
Tuesday evening, after a full and free
discussion of the twenty-five nominees
for Councilmen at large, at which the
following clubs were represented, the
West Oakland Improvement Club, the
Lake Merritt Sanitary Club, ttte Tele
graph Avenue and Northern Oakland
Improvement Club, the North Oakland
Improvement Club, the Linda Vista Im
provement Club, the Oakland Improve
ment Club and the Peralta Heights Im
provement Club, the following candi
dates were indorsed as the choice of the
clubs: A. Barstow, J. C. Bullock, C. H.
Kramm and B. 11. Welch. A special
committee, consisting of one representa
tive from each club, was appointed to
take charge of the details and un earn
est effort will be made by the various
clubs having the improvement of our fair
city at heart to elect those whom they
know can be counted on to favor a judi
cious expenditure of the city's money for
the many needed improvements that our
city wants, some of which are now under
JURY MAY NOT VIEW
THE SCENE OF THE MURDER
PROSECUTION IN BRANDES' CASE ,
OBJECTS TO THE STEP.
Dr. Crowley Discredits the Theory j
That Lillian Brandes Died of
Meningitis Caused by
Blows on Her Head.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 8.
The jury trying William A. Brandt 8 for
the murder of his little daughter may not
view the former Brandes home in Berke
ley, where the crime is alleged to have
been committed.
It Is expected that the defense will con
clude with its expert testimony early in
the day to-morrow, and an application
will then be made by Brandes' attorneys
asking that the Jury view the premises.
This application will be vigorously op
posed by the prosecution. "The Supreme
Court has said that it don't believe in tak
ing Juries out to view premises unless
there is urgent need," said Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Melvin this afternoon. "In
the case of the People vs. Southern, 120
Cal., the Supreme Court says the trial
court has an absolute discretion in grant
ing or refusing such application, but sug
gests that under ordinary circumstances
the safe course would be a denial of the
application. The decision says: "There
is always great danger that something
may be said or done or omitted to be done
In taking a view which will operate in
creating a mistrial of the cause.' Hence
we will most assuredly oppose any such
appllcatioH in the Brandes case."
The trial was resumed this morning, and
though Juror Sieben appeared still quite
ill he managed to hold out until 1:30
o'clock this afternoon, when his condi
tion again became worse and an adjourn
ment was taken until to-morrow morning
at 9:30. Philip Sieben is of the best class
of German-American citizens. He retired
from active business occupation many
years ago, and being unaccustomed to the
trying ordeal of a protracted trial it has
affected his nerves.
Dr. A. H. Pratt was on the stand again
this morning for further cross-examina
tion. His testimony, however, proved of
little consolation for either side, j He said
that the Injuries or symptoms as ex
plained in the hypothetical question put
by the prosecution were not sufficient for
bim to determine the cause of death. He
stated that "nothing is definite in medi
cine;'therefore nothing is definite in the
pvmptoms of meningitis," so that he was
able only to speak of the ordinary or
usual symptoms. .
Dr. D. D. Crowley, the last of the de
fense's medical experts, was next called.
In response to the long hypothetical ques
tion that Attorney Bennett has asked
each of his experts Dr. Crowley answered
that Lillian "might have died of hang
ing." As to whether the girl could have
lived from Tuesday until the following
Saturday/supposing she had been struck
on the head, without exhibiting any signs
of distress, witness declared that then she
did not die of concussion of the brain or
shock, or meningitis; neither did Dr.
Crowley believe that she died of beating.
On cross-examination witness contra
dicted Dr. Pratt by saying that he found
no abnormal adhesions in the dura mater
of Lillian Brandes. Â, ._
He also said that in meningitis the pa
tient generally becomes delirious from
twenty to twenty-four hours before deatn,
but he afterward modified somewhat by
saving that the symptoms varied and that
there were cases where a patient would
conceal pain, particularly where he or she
is afraid of those about them.
In the main Dr. Crowley corroborated
Dr. E. H. Woolsev. chief medical expert
for the defense, so far as the theory of the
girl's death is concerned.
THE BOOK SOCIAL.
Oro Fino Parlor's Idea Brought Much
Literature to the Native Daugh
ters' Home.
The pretty parlors of the Native Daugh
ters'. Home at 925 O'Farrell street were
crowded last night by friends of the in
stitution, who assembled on the invitation
of Oro Flno Parlor to enjoy the book
social given for the purpose of starting a
library for the home. Each person who
accepted the invitation was requested to
bring a bound book, which would be ac
cepted in lieu of a money fee for admis
sion. The books as received were placed
in a pile, and by the time the last one was
handed to the attendant in charge there
were enough to fill several shelves.
There were a number of the prominent
members of the Native Daughters pres
ent. For the entertainment of all there
was presented a programme which had
for its features: Piano solo, Miss Helen
Ford: vocal solo, Fannie Igo; exhibition
of fancy dancing. Miss Helen Wright;
tenor solo. William Fenstermacher; reci
tation. Miss Hazel Buckley; vocal solo.
Miss May Walsh; piano recital. Miss J.
Toplitz; humorous songs, W. J. Hynes;
vocal solo, Mrs. Kennedy, and a farce en
titled 'â¢Advertising for a Companion," by
four members of Oro Fino Parlor.
Mrs. W. S. Leake, chairwoman of the
committee of the home, during the evening
delivered an address on the subject of the
'new institution and fully explained in a
comprehensive manner its purpose, and
urged upon the Native Daughters to unite
in their efforts to make it a success.
The affair, which was arranged by Mrs.
Dollle Bradley, Miss May Meany. Miss
Tillie Stahl. Mrs. C. F. Kapp. Miss Nellie
Mulcahy and Mrs. Wright, was a decided
success, and ought to be an incentive for
other parlors to emulate CTro Fino in ex
tending a helping hand to the home.
STRICKEN DOWN
WITH PARALYSIS
CAPTAIN DELANY SUDDENLY
ATTACKED AT BYRON.
The Stroke. Which Came Upon the
Ex-Supervisor Unexpectedly, Is
Serious but Not Neces
sarily Fatal.
Ex-Supervisor Captain P. M. Delany,
familiarly termed the "Cappun." is lying
at his home, 1210 Mission street, in a
critical condition, having been stricken
with paralysis on Wednesday last at By
ron Springs,* whither he had gone to en-
Joy a rest. The stroke, which came upon
Captain Delany suddenly and unexpect
edly, has affected his left arm and the left
side of his face. The attack is quite se
rious, though not necessarily fatal, and
it will be some time before he will be
strong enough to be about.
For months past the captain has not
been feeling well, and last week his phy
sicians advised him to go to the springs
for a few weeks. As soon as he was
stricken with paralysis Captain Delany
sent for ' Dr. Ragan, who immediately
went to the springs. On arriving there
Dr. Ragan found the captain's condition
very much worse than his friends in this
city expected.
His condition yesterday, however, was
considerably improved, and Dr. Ragan de
cided to remove his patient to his home
in this city. On arriving at the Oakland
Mole last night the "cappun" and Dr.
Ragan were met by ex-Supervisor Shee
han, who had a carriage in waiting. Cap
tain Delanv's residence was literally be
sieged last night by his many friends who
â¢were anxious to learn something about
his condition.
RAID ON POOL ROOMS.
Chief Lees Seizes the Paraphernalia
in Dens of Gambling.
Acting under the instructions of Chief
Lees, Captain Spillane detailed Policemen
Tyrrell, Esola, Fraher, Clark, Eastman,
Royston, Burke and Macdowell to raid
the different poolrooms south of Market
street yesterday afternoon.
The officers gathered at 1 p m. and vis
ited poolrooms owned by the following:
Sam Reynolds, 906 Market street; Broyer
& Glynn. 276 Stevenson street; Berry &
Co., 269 Stevenson street: Dunn & Co., 206
Stevenson street, and Broyer & Glynn.
Fourth and Mission streets. Simultane
ously the guardians of the peace seized
the paraphernalia in use, consisting of
the books, checks, blackboards and other
articles. The people in the poolrooms
made a break for the door, but after they
saw that the officers were not to arrest
them they returned. The following ar
rests were made: Sam Reynolds. Harry
Hill, George Williams, John Connelly and
Paul Briggs. These were taken to the
City Prison, where a charge of violating
the poolroom ordinance was booked
against them. They were released on
cash bail.
The same parties have been arrested
several times before, an I caffs against
them all are pending in the Police Courts,
-'his is the first time that Chief Lees has
decided upon seizing" the paraphernalia,
and in doing so he is following the practice
adopted by him with regard to the nlckel
in-the-slot machines. He is determined
to held the property unless the courts or
der him to deliver it up.
Health of Students Involved.
The bad condition of the plumbing at
the Affiliated Colleges has been brought
to the attention of Health Officer O'Brien,
and that official will report the matter
at once to i,.e university regents. The
chief complaint is that sewage from the
buildings is carried but a short distance,
where it gathers in a cesspool.
VICTOR HECK PRIZES
HIS KLONDIKE TEETH
Â© ALAMEDA, March* Victor Heck, a well-known citizen of this city, Â©
Â© settled a suit to-day brought against him in City Recorder St. Sure's O
Â© court by a dentist named Morels. Heck would not consent to a dismissal O
Â© of the action until he recovered his two eye teeth, plugged with Klon- O
O dike gold, which were the cause of the trouble. Q
Â© The claim was for $17 50 for "labor performed and material furnished" Â©
Â© in extracting the aforesaid eye Teeth. The attorneys for both sides had Â©
Â© agreed upon a compromise when Heck appeared in court and objected fu- Q
O riously to settling the case. 'V;; O
Â© "I want my teeth first," he declared, "and will not consent to any fur- Q
O ther proceedings until I get them." O
Â© "What teeth?" asked the surprised attorneys. Â©
Â© "Why, the two eye teeth Moreis pulled from my Jaw. They were Q
Â© filled with Klondike gold, and the doctor failed to keep his promise and O
O replace them in my head," was the excited reply. "The gold in those O
O teeth is of the finest quality and hard stuff to get. A friend sent It to me O
Â© from the north, and fearing that I might lose it I engaged the doctor to Q
Â© drill holes in my eye teeth and bury it in them. In order to make the Â©
Â© holes big enough the doctor pulled the teeth, telling me he would trans- Â©
Â© plant them in my jaw later on. So my teeth were extracted, converted O
O into burglar-proof safes and put back in my mouth. The strain on my O
Â© nervous system was too severe, and I was forced to have them pulled O
Â© again until my jaw got into condition to stand the transplanting process. O
O After they were extracted the last time I felt so good about it that I Q
Â© kissed Dr. Morels on the forehead and bade him a tearful farewell. It Â©
Â© was a painful parting, and I remember it vividly to this day. I want O
Â© those teeth: They are worth money and are mine." VV Â©
Â© â  The counsel for the physician soothed the irate Heck by giving him Q
Â© the following order on Morels: o
o V 'VV o
Â© Dr. Morrisâ Sir: The bearer Is entitled to two teeth which you have in Â©
O your possession. They were pulled from his Jaw and belong to him without ques- Â©
q i lon " Â» PHIL DIBEST. Attorney. Q
O . . /__&Â£â¢ V-V-VV^ Vo ;
O Heck soon produced the golden teeth in the Recorder's office and con- Q
O sented to the settlement agreed upon by the attorneys. O
Â© "I would not part with those teeth for anything," said Heck. "I Q
Â© intend to grow them in my jaw again some day, and am going home now Â©
O to try to drive them into place with a tack hammer." Â©

DEADLY GAS KILLS
A WELL-KNOWN BROKER
Frederick Stiel the Latest Victim
of Carelessness.
FREDERICK STIED, senior member of the firm of F. Stiel & Co., 219 Front
street, was found dead in his bed yesterday morning, having been asphyx
iated by illuminating gas in his room at 642 Fulton street, the residence of
J. A. Bernstein, where he had been living for many years. The deceased
had been ill with kidney complaint for about a week, and when he was able
to go out, which was last Tuesday, he celebrated the occasion with his friends
too recklessly and on his return home that night he was very much under the
influence of liquor. â -'â ':. â  :-'â â 
When Mr. Bernstein was leaving the house yesterday morning his atten
tion was attracted by the odor of gas. He traced it to the room occupied by
Stiel and forcing the door found the latter lying dead in bed. One of the stop
cocks on the gas fixtures was partly turned on, but there was no Indication
whatever that the death of the old man was other than accidental.
The body was removed to the Morgue, and an inquest will be held. Stiel was
a native of Germany, 6S years old. He was a widower and left two sons, one
in Honolulu and the other in Heidelberg, Germany.
Mr. Stiel was associated with P. T. Brunsing in the brokerage business, their
specialty being Eastern accounts. He was also salesman for Lachman & Jacobl,
and was a prominent member of the Commercial Travelers' Association.
COMMISSIONER NORTH
SCATHINGLY REBUKED
CALLED DOWN BY SECRETARY
OF THE TREASURY.
Suit Against Captain Van Oterendorp
for Alleged Violation of Immi
gration Laws Dismissed. .
Immigration Commissioner North has
been once more rapped over the knuckles
by the Secretarj' of the Treasury for an
other of his annoying blunders.
The rap has arrived In the shape of a
communication from the Secretary di
recting United States Attorney Foote to
dismiss the suit brought by North some
time ago against Captain K. Van Oteren
dorp of the steamship Alameda to recover
53000 penalty for the alleged unlawful
landing by the captain of three members
of his crew, which North averred were
aliens and not entitled to land. .
When the suit was brought counsel for
the captain filed a protest with the Secre
tary of the Treasury against the czarlike
methods of the local Immigration Com
missioner, and made a statement asking
for an investigation of the mare's nest
discovered by the astute Commissioner.
An Investigation was had, with the result
as outlined. The Secretary says that he
is convinced that Captain Van Oterendorp
is not engaged in smuggling immigrants
into this port, and informs Mr. North that
two of the three men for which the pen
alty was sought to be collected are
American citizens and have a right to
land, notwithstanding the doubts of Mr.
North.
The case has been dismissed according
ly. This is the second time that Commis
sioner North has been called back to
earth when soaring among the crowned
heads of Europe, Asia and Africa, and
his fall has been very hard. His prede
cessor, Mr. Stradley, though a Democrat,
never made blunders such as those which
have elevated the present Commissioner
into his present unenviable notoriety.
Myer Is Convicted.
Leon M. Myer, charged with swindling
Florence Gladding out of diamonds val
ued at $500, was convicted of petty lar
ceny by a jury ln. Judge Cook's court
yesterday. He will be sentenced Satur

OLYMPIC CLUB FIGHT
NOT A BRUTAL AFFAIR
POLICE COMMISSIONERS DIS
CUSS CHIEF LEES' CASE.
There Being No Formal Charges the
Matter Will Be DroppedâOffi
cer Pichon Fined.
Police Officer Pichon was fined $10 and
reprimanded by the Police Commissioners
last night for having used his club on
Louis Isaacs on the night of January 23.
Isaacs was walking along Stockton street,
between Washington and Jackson, when
he overtook a crowd of voting men who
were making considerable noise. A3
Isaacs turned out to pass them Officer
Pichon swooped down to stop the dis
turbance and landed upon the inoffensive
citizen. Before Isaacs could explain he
received a couple of pokes in the stomach
with the policeman's club, for which ho
preferred charges.
The charge of ill-treatment against
Special Officer Joseph Glllen, preferred by
Frank Rosso, was dismissed. The Com
missioners found that Rosso, who is a
habitue of the Barbary Coast, first at
tacked the officer.
The Commissioners considered infor
mally the newspaper charge against
Chief Lees of countenancing a brutal
glove contest In the Olympic Club rooms
on March 1. The Chief made a statement
denying the charges made by a newspa
per of this city and was substantiated
by Sergeant John B. Martin, who, in a
written report, denied that the Chief had
signaled to him not to stop the fight.
Martin also reported that after the fight
he saw McGee, the contestant, who, it
was reported, was badly used up, and
that McGee was not Injured ln any way
and the only marks he bore were a
bleeding nose and a discoloration of one
eye. McGee also furnished a signed
statement. In which he denied that he
was hurt In the contest, but claimed, on
the contrary, that had the fight lasted a
round or two longer he would have put
his opponent out. The day after the
fight McGee helped' his mother move and
the following day he went to work.
As no formal charge had been pre
ferred against the Chief the Commission
ers took no action in the matter.

Either a Broken Engage

Embezzlement.
C HA RLES G. NAGLE is not. a kiss

of the most prominent attorneys of
the city, and talks loudly when he
has been drinking. He has sub
mitted to the wiles of the kodak fiend.
had his photo taken in shirt sleevss In
b lady's backyard, and Indulged in the In
teresting pastime of changing girls lor
half an hour at a picnic.
In his big-hearted way Nagle has given
his love to an entire family and his pho
tograph to tho 10-year-old sister of the
young divorcee that wore his ring. He
has taken the same fair lady to the doc
tor with him and let her revel in the'mys
teries that belonged to his carbuncles, tie
has spent his evenings and his Bundays
With her, and in a burst of admiring
frenzy has even fallen upon his knees
Jn the middle of tho roadside and with
hands outstretched to the starry heavens
above, proclaimed that he loved Nellie
Rodgers and would die for Nellie Rodgers.
All these many delightful attributes of
the well- known friend of the notorious
Rev. C. O. Rrown were brought out be
fore Judge gan in Police Court De
partment No. 1 yesterday in the ease of
Mrs. Nellie Igers. who is charged by
Nagle with felonious embezzlement and
accused of having In her possession a
ring set with a diamond and two garnets
and valued at $150, which Is said to be
the property of the said attorney.
According to Nag story and the
â witnesses who testified in his behalf the
ring In dispute was obtained by the defend
ant from the complainant ostensibly for
the purpose of admiring the jewel at close
range. "ttet me look at your ring," so
Nagle declares the lady said when he met
her at a fashionable oyster house, where
he had 'gone to sustain his waning

"only don't forget to return it to me."
But she forgot and continued to forgetâ
on purposeâ and hence the suit. In sub
stance, this is the story Nagle told on
the stand.
He was dressed for his part of star wit
ness. He wore a gorgeous vest, in which
tiny crimson stars twinkled on an emerald
green ground and a white tie that
Bet off his firm, well molded chin and well
barbered mustache. He carried himself
with the stunning haughtiness of a star
parlor actor and "eiocuted" his re
sponses, letting his voice rise at the com
mas and fall at the colons. Unfortunately
for Mr. Nagle, he browsed far away from
the questions put to him, and soon had
revealed to an Interested public that ho

think of marrying herâ that he had called
upon her frequently, had taken her, her
RACING GAMBLERS
INTEND TO FIGHT
They Are Determined to Retain
Their Evil Grasp Upon
the City.
Supervisors Are Warned That an Effort
Will Be Made to Debauch
Them.
.'HP HE gamblers of Ingleslde do not
intend to be driven without do not '
intend to be driven without a Strug- â 
J. gle from their nest of evil at the
racetrack. They are determined to |
fight as they fought before, and no se- I
cret is being made of tho fact that their ,
weapon will be money. Corrlgan and j
his fellows realize that they have no i
legitimate argument to offer in their j
own behalf, and they have no scruples i
in resorting to any artifice that will i
help them to continue their degenerate j
and demoralizing substitute for sport |
at Ingleside.
A day after the Supervisors passed to
print the resolution prohibiting book
making and poolselling the gamblers
declared that they would migrate to
Oakland. The contract made by the
managers of both racetracks made it
possible for the local manipulators to
fasten their burden of crime and dis
grace upon the people of Oakland. In
pique, therefore, the racehorse contin
gent of this city announced that they
would go to the track at Emeryville.
The announcement had the effect
which the gamblers*, did not expect. The
prospective annihilation of Ingleside as
It Is now conducted was welcomed as
ii relief from a terrible evil. People of
every class were eager to express their
commendation. Corrigan and his as
sociates discovered very quickly that
their presence ln San Francisco was
riot wanted. Certain classes of citizens
from whom the racing surethlng men
expected some support were a unit in
praising the Board of Supervisors for
its action. Men ln every condition in
life welcomed the change that means
so much to the welfare of the city.

the first place, that liquor dealers

and to picnics, and that he had written to
the fair one epistles in which the only
phrase of affection was "give my love to
all the family."
"I was friendly with all the family," the
attorney testified. "When I called my call
was intended for the whole family. I gave
them one of my photographs; gave it to
the little Bister for all the family. Yes,
and they have a whole lot of photos of
mineâ kodak things, taken ln the family
back yard and at picnics. Yes, I went to
picnics an.i had my photos taken with
Mrs. Rodgers at picnics. But that does
not signify anythingâ at a picnic." And
the attorney smiled expressively and audi
bly. Those present laughed, tho Judge
looked wise, the bailiff rapped for order,
and thus waa unfolded the ethics of pic
nic life.
In the morning Mrs. Rodders was an in
terested spectator. In the afternoon she
took the stand and scored even a greater
success than Nagle. She brought to the
witness chair a charming personality, a
guileless manner and incidentally a hint
of the latest style in bonnets and color
ing in silk waists. For his elocution she
substituted sarcasm. What he had treat
ed frivolously she touched positively. The
only point on which the two agreed was
the one which revolved round the social
picnic.
"Do you recognize this picture?" said
B. K. Collier, the attorney for the prose
cution. "At the time It was taken you
say you were engaged to Mr. Nagle?"
"Yes, sir."
"Yet in that picture you are In the arms
of Harry R. Fee, and his lips are pressed
closely to your own."
"Oh, that was at a picnic. The boys
had changed girls foe half an hour."
Mrs. Rodgers' examination developed
the line of defense, which Is that the rin?
Nagle brings suit to recover was a ring
he had given the lady as an engagement
ring; that after the engagement had ex
power to perpetuate the racing evil.
On the contrary, liquor dealers have
been among the most enthusiastic in
dorsers of the Supervisors in the pres
ent campaign. These merchants have
the same reason for condemning Ingle
side and its methods as have other de
cent members of the community.
They have gone personally to the
members of the Board of Supervisors
to encourage them in the stand they
have taken. Representatives of every '
decent element in the city have done !
the same, for the adoption of the law, !
which has been passed to print, means I
much to the people of San Francisco. j
On every hand the Supervisors have j
been congratulated for what they have
done. In demonstrating themselves to I
be proof against the corruption of the \
gamblers the Supervisors have earned i
a tribute which has been gladly given. '.
But the greatest fight of the cam- j
paign is yet to be lost or won. The j
Ingleslde schemers boast that they have !
power to corrupt the Supervisors and
either destroy or modify into practical
worthlessness the new ordinance. No !
one except the gamblers accepts this
boast as the truth. The Supervisors \
have taken a determined stand and
there is absolutely nothing to Justify !
even the suggestion of a suspicion that
the members of the board will hesitate J
in their crusade after they have gone j
so far on the road of good government i
and public morals.
The gamblers are simply boasting
that they have already found authori
ties of this city susceptible to corrup
tion and the thieving game of the race
course Is far too valuable to be aban
doned without an effort. The Super
visors are therefore on their guard
against the track schemers. The plan
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 1899.
tended over a period of several months
Mrs. Rodgers, on account of his habitual
Intemperance, discarded Nagle, and that
his suit was brought in a spirit of vln
dictiveness.
"I became engaged to Nagle early in
June," said Mrs. Rodgers. "He gave me
an engagement ring. After a while he got
to drinking heavily, and I determined to
have nothing further to do with him. As
for the ring, I have not got it any more.
One evening as I was returning from
work I saw Nagle near my home In a
beastly state of intoxication. He was
leaning against a church. When
I perceived him I began to run,
drawing off my gloves as I did so. The
next morning I found I had lost the ring.
That same evening, after I got home,
Nagle came to the house and raised a
terrible rumpus. He demanded admission
and when it was refused him he got down
on his knees in the middle of the street
and wildly screeched that he was a promi
nent attorney, that he loved Nellie-Rod
gers and was ready to die for Nellie Rod
gers. Afterward he held up a milk wagon,
drank milk and fell asleep on the pave
ment.
"No, I don't remember what he said
when he gave me the ring, and really I
can't say. He didn't place it on my finger
and kiss me, Mr. Nagle Is not a kissing
man."
Miss Edith Lord, sister of Mrs. Rodgers,
also testified to the hilarious fashion in
which Nagle was wont to make calls in
"the wee sma' hours" at the home of his
fiancee.
"He came one morning at 3 o'clock. He
was terribly intoxicated. He called upon
my mother to produce Nellie Rodgers,
saying if she did not he would cut her
(mother's) heart out. The ring he Is
suing for now was Nellie's engagement
ring. When he got to drinking so Nellie
decided to have nothing further to do
with him. Every time he called I wont
to the door and said Nellie was not at
of Corrigan's followers is now to have
some member of the Board of Super
visors introduce an amendment to the
resolution which has already been
passed to print.
The purpose of this amendment will
be to delay the adoption of the original
resolution, if nothing else is possible.
The amendment will have to take the
same course as the original resolution
and time at least will be gained by the
gamblers. Every effort will be made
to do more than this and to neutralize
the effect of the new ordinance by
saddling upon it some substitute.
Some of the gamblers were boasting
yesterday that they had found a mem
ber of the board who was willing to
act as their catspaw in the matter.
Members of the board were interviewed
yesterday and all declared emphatically
that the report circulated by the track
manipulaters is utterly without founda
tion. Every member who voted for the
resolution declares that he will supple
ment his first vote with another which
will make the resolution a law.
The Supervisors feel that the people
of the city are looking to them to be
freed from a great evil and nothing
can intervene to prevent the fulfillment
of the trust. The gamblers of Ingle
side, so. members of the Board of Su
pervisors say, will not be allowed to
buy the privilege of debauching San
Francisco.
. In this resolution the Supervisors
may congratulate themselves upon the
hearty support of every reputable and
decent element in the city. Ministers
of every denomination will speak from
their pulpits In advocacy of the new
law. Merchants arid tradesmen of all
classes will give support to a measure
that is a protection to them and a safe
guard to their employes. The city is
thoroughly aroused and the people will
give every encouragement in their
power to their representatives.
The gamblers have already attempt
ed to blackmail some tradesmen into
an expression of protest to the scheme,
but the plan fortunately has failed.
The masters of Ingleside will have to
migrate, therefore, to Emeryville and
share with the gamblers of Oakland
the profits of a restricted field or fight
a hard battle in the courts. Neither
prospect is a cheerful, one. The Oak
land contingent does not like its con
tract to share its crime-nest with the
Ingleslde people. Victims are not so
plentiful that they may be willingly
shared. . The Oakland schemers would
prefer, therefore, to see the Ingleslde
people stay where they are.
If the controversy is carried into the
courts there is every reason to believe
that the new ordinance will be sus
tained as constitutional. It Is general
in character and operates against no
special class. It Is within the legiti
mate police power of the Board of Su
pervisors and is justified by many de
cisions of the Supreme Court. This is
now the situation in reference to the
new ordinance and there will be no
change until next Monday afternoon,
when the Board of Supervisors will
again vote upon the ordinance. The
members know that every effort will be

home. That should have been enough for
any man." Miss Lord also testified that
she had been on picnics and that Harry R.
Fee was her "young man."
Miss Nettle Kip of 515 McAllister street
testified that Mrs. Rodgers had shown her
the ring and said it was the pledge of her
betrothal to Nagle, and Harry R. Fee
offered testimony to the same effect.
John Luft, a grocer, told how he had
acted as the Nagle Mercury and had
called Mrs. Rodgers to the 'phone In his
store to receive messages from the attor
ney. "Mrs. Rodgers showed me the ring
and said she was to marry Nagle," said
Luft.
On Saturday morning the witnesses in
rebuttal will be examined. A spicy bit of
evidence to be offered is the two following
letters from Mrs. Rodgers to the man to
whom she claims she was engaged:

At Home- My father came walking In this
morning very unexpected to us all. He says It
is very warm in the country.
Now, C. G., this Is what I want to ask you.
You know I spoke to you about going to Angeles

want you to find a gentleman for her. or If
you like you go with Edith and I will go with

I must stop drinking anything: my stomach i 3

Sailing of the Australia
for Hawaii.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda and Toyo Risen Kaisha's Hongkong
Maru both arrived from Honolulu yester
day. The Alameda was from Australia,
New Zealand and Samoa before calling at
Hawaii, while the Hongkong Maru came
from China and Japan. The Alameda was
the last to leave Honolulu and the first
to reach San Francisco, beating the Hong
kong Maru from deck to dock by over 12
hours. It was hardly a fair test, how
ever, for although the Hongkong Maru
is a new ship on her maiden voyage, there
is something the matter with her boilers,
and the firemen cannot keep steam on
them. When the vessel was in Honolulu
a gang of boiler makers was at work on
her, and everything was supposed to be
in good shape when she sailed. Something
went wrong in the engine room, however,
and the Alameda ran away from her.
The Hongkong Maru left Honolulu at 10
p. m. on the Ist Inst., and the Alameda at
2 a. m. on the 2d inst. At 9a. m. yester
day the Alameda was tied up in the Oce
anic dock, while it was after 5 p. m. be
fore the Hongkong Maru reached the
Mail dock. The latter vessel is a sister
ship to the Nippon Maru, and is not
nearly as handsome or as well appointed
a vessel as the America Maru. The
Hongkong Maru brought all the Hawaiian
mail and also the files, much to the dis
gust of people doing business with the
islands.
The Hongkong Maru left Hongkong on
February 8, Yokohama on February 19
and Honolulu on March 1. She brings

cabin " and eighty-one Chinese steerage

moved from place to place while the
quarantine officer was trying- to count
them and in consequence the task had to
be gone over attain and again before the
doctor could get them to tally with the
passenger list.
The Alameda brought the news of the
wreck of the American ship Edward
O'Brien. The vessel left Departure Bay
en February 2 for Honolulu with a cargo
of coal. On February 27 she passed Dia
mond Head and stood In for Honolulu.
Captain Banfield ran close to the entrance
In the reef, intending to anchor and wait
for a tug. The starboard anchor was let
go, but the headway on the vessel was so
great that It parted the anchor chain. The
port anchor was then dropped, but before
it held the ship crashed on to the west
Bide of the entrance and in spite of every
effort struck there. She finally became a
total wreck and was to be sold at auc
tion the day the Alameda sailed.
The Edward O'Brien was built at Thom
astown, Me., in * ts 2, and was 2157 tons net
burden. She was 259.1 feet long, 42.5 feet
broad and 28.9 feet deep.
The Alameda brought up fifty-six cabin
and 100 steerage passengers. Among them
were Mme. Amelie Salmon, Mme. Mary
Jackson and Mme. Alice Power of the Sis
terhood of the Sacred Heart. They have
been transferred from Australia to Amer
ica. Thomas R. Kyle, professor of physi
cal science in the University of Mel
bourne, was also a passenger. Orpheus
McAdo, head of the Jubilee Singers in
Australia, came over from Sydney to se
cure more talent for his organization.

seen at the Orpheum next week, and Wil

German representative in Samoa, who
made so much trouble, came up from
Apia. He has been removed from office,
and Dr. Golf succeeded him. Nine Inva
lided members of the First Colorado and
twelve of the First Nebraska regiments
returned on the Alameda.
The Alameda brought up in treasure
$1,010,000. being the balance in trade be
tween Australia and America
The Norwegian bark Prince Edward
has been posted at Lloyd's as "missing"
and the gamblers in reinsurance will
have to pay up. The Prince Edward left
Baltimore for Honolulu over eight
months ago and was given up for lost
some time ago. She was formerly the
British bark Somersetshire and was built
in 1867. She was 193.5 feet long, 39.9 feet
broad and 23.9 feet deep, with a tonnage
of 2180 net. She was coal laden.
The Chilean bark Elisa, which went
ashore at the entrance to the harbor at
Shanghai and became a wreck, has been
sold at auction. She was lumber laden
from Puget Sound. The hull sold for
$4050 and the cargo for $5500.
