Policy.
SENSATIONAL SPEECH IN HOUSE
Chief Executive Charged With Re
taining Philippines in Interests of
Capitalists Pledged to Aid Him.
Special Dispatc h to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â During the general debate upon the
army appropriation bill in the House to-day Johnson (R.) of Indi
ana, who a fortnight ago made several notable speeches violently at
tacking the policy of the administration during the consideration of
the army reorganization bill, returned to the assault and delivered
against the President and some of his advisers the most scathing
philippic heard in the House for months. He sneered at the Presi
dent and the influences which he alleged controlled him, impugned his
motives, questioned his sincerity and likened him to Dickens' most
contemptible character, charged his Secretary of War with incompe
tency and predicted that the President would in the end be engulfed
by adverse public sentiment. Although his utterances were far
more sensational than those in his former speeches and dazed some
of his auditors by the impetuosity with which they were delivered
the speech did not raise about him the storm of his former speeches.
Landis. one of his Republican colleagues from Indiana, briefly
stated to the House that Johnson's colleagues had repudiated him,
and the two members had a wordy duel. Later in the day Marsh (R.)
of Illinois replied to some of Johnson's strictures, but the Republican
leaders had evidently decided to ignore the attacks of the Indianan
and no general reply was made to his speech to-day.
THE army appropriation bill to
day was lost sight of in the gen
eral discussion of the policy of
the Government relative to the
Philippines and several notable
' speeches -were made, particularly that,
of. Settle (D.) of Kentucky. The gen
: eral, debate on the bill closed to-day,

â¢ "A few evenings ago." he began, "the

principal guest. From the newspaper
accounts of the affair it was an exceed
ingly elaborate one. The Secretary of
War was in attendance, he whom the
Boston populace had hissed upon the
â¢ " street a few hours before, ere they
turned to greet with rapturous ap

It was interlarded, was- nothing more
or less than a carefully devised and
studious mlsstatement of the issue be
tween the chief executive and those of
his own party who are opposed to his
wretched policy in the Philippines. It
was an effort to befog tlje subject and
to mislead the public judgment. We
are told, sir, that this address was re
ceived with enthusiastic applause by
those who heard it, but we who read
it in cold print in the light of the in
defensible tragedy now being enacted
near the shores of Asia, involuntarily
think of that creation of Charles Dick
ens, who was accustomed to roll his
eyes piously to heaven and exclaim
with great ostentation to those _about
him, 'My friends, let us be moral,' and
who was the father of two daughters,
one of whom he named Charity and the
other Mercy.
"His Excellency declared upon this
occasion, if not in so many words, at
least in effect, that he had never en
tertained any policy with respect to th&
Philippines up to the time the treaty
of peace was ratified; but that he had
simply held them as commander in
chief, the questions as to their disposi
tion and control to be determined there
after by Congress.
"If the chief executive really feels as
he declared at the banquet that he did,
that the disposition of the Philippines
is a matter to be determined by Con
gress, why does not he call a special
session of Congress to settle the mat
ter at once and then keep his hands
off? Heaven knows, there is need of
action. If he is sincere, why did he
permit his supporters in the Senate to
vote down the other day the Bacon res
olution which distinctly declared that
the United States entertained no inten
tion of permanently holding these isl
ands? Why did he Insist that the Mc-
Enery resolution should be passed, a
resolution which is a fraud, a delusion
and a snare â a shameful evasion which,
like a Christmas tree, has something
upon it for everybody. That resolution
is intended simply to quiet the con
science of the American people, to lull
all opposition to sleep while the Presi
dent goes ahead, waging relentless and
merciless war against the Filipinos and
laying deep and secure the foundations
for a permanent American colony.
"Mr. Chairman, I am determined that
the President shall neither befog the
issue between himself and those of the
Republican party who oppose his Phil
ippine policy nor mislead the public
judgment, nor shirk the responsibility
for the grossest blunders which he has
committed in connection with this great
problem. I insist that the whole policy
is not simply an error, but that it is
a crime; and that the chief executive
of this nation is the one who has pre
cipitated upon us the embarrassments
and the difficulties by which we are
now confronted. I insist that he did
not simply hold the Philippines as com
mander in chief, leaving the question
of disposition and control of them to
Congress, but that he formulated and
put into execution an affirmative and
aggressive policy, that of their perma
nent annexation to this country, and
forced it to the Senate with all the
power and influence which his high of
fice enabled him to employ.
"The President's first impression was
to demand of the people of the Philip
pines simply a coaling station, a meas
ure amply sufficient for all of our legiti

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1899.
REPUBLIC OF FRANCE
IN SMALL DANGER
PARIS, Feb. 24.â M. Paul
Deroulede is trying hard to
turn his blunder into an act of
heroism. It was apparently the
Government's wish to let him
down so easily that only the ri
diculous side of his escapade
would strike the people. There
is only amusement felt at the way
in which he walked into the open
arms of the police just at the mo
ment when the authorities were
wondering how to prevent him
doing mischief without at the
same time adding to his impor
tance in the eyes of the populace.
His grotesque appeal of yester
day gave him a fine opportun
ity. After haranguing General
Roget to save France from some
thing which he was too exjcited to
specify definitely, M. Deroulede
committed the blunder of refus
ing to leave the barracks when
ordered to do so, and was
promptly arrested on the ridicu
lous charge of illegal trespass.
When Deroulede was told by
M. Cochefert, Chief de la Police
de Surete, last night what the ac
cusation against him was he was
stupefied with indignation. To
dream of revolution and be ar-

rested for trespassing was too
much for his ebullient nature,
and he broke out with an indig
nant protest, declaring that he
had attempted to induce the sol
diery to join him in overthrowing
the parliamentary republic and
replacing it with some embryonic
monstrosity which he calls a
"plebescitary republic," pre
sumably meaning a form of gov
ernment in which he would ap
peal to the people represented by
the gang that is always at his
heels upon every important ques
tion.
Perhaps the truth is lie saw
that the contempt with which the
Government was preparing to
treat his abortive coup would
kill him politically, so he made a
bid for a martyr's crown by
pleading guilty to the serious
crime of sedition, for which the
code provides punishment of
from three months' to two years'
imprisonment with a fine of 3000
francs. M. Deroulede has de
clared his offense and signed his

however, all would have been well. The
whole Union would have followed him
cheerfully and to-day we would have
been at peace with the Philippine re
public; our army and navy, which is
now waging war against our former
friends and allies, would have been dis
banded. No army bill for a standing
army of 100,000 men would have been

declaration. M.. Marcel Habert
his lieutenant, says he is willing
to do what his chief says.
There was much excitement in
the Chamber of Deputies this af
ternoon and a large attendance of
members.
The President of the House,
M. Deschanel, declared that he
had received a request to prose
cute MM. Deroulede and Mar
cel Habert. The statement was
greeted with cries of "Read."
The President then read a let
ter from the Public Prosecutor,
according to which General
Roget deposed that a band of
men, headed by Deroulede and
Marcel Habert, followed his bri
gade and entered the courtyard
of the barracks occupied by the
troops.
MM. Deroulede and Marcel
Habert, the general further de
posed, questioned the officers
and refused to leave when re
quired to do so. Therefore they
were arrested and confessed that
they wished to lead the troops
ready to reduce instead of getting ready
to greatly increase the burden of our
taxation. But the President committed
a fatal error. He wrote into that treaty
the absolute transfer of Spanish sov
ereignty over the Philippines to our
selves and the payment of $20,000,000 as
a consideration for the cession. Then
he issued to the people of the Philip
pines a proclamation in which ho in
formed them that the United States
had succeeded to the title of Spain, de
clared that the government and con

and replace the "parliamentary
republic by a plebiscite republic"
(Uproar.)
The two Deputies mentioned
were then removed to the police
station.
The Public Prosecutor asked
for authority to prosecute the
two prisoners on the charge of
attempting to turn - the troops
from their duty. :* -
M.Castelin, Republican mem
ber for one of the -divisions of
Aisne, moved that MM. Derou
lede and Marcel Habert be set at
liberty, provisionally, without
prejudicing their prosecution, de
claring that he knew of their love
for the republic, and did not be
lieve his friends were as guilty as
represented.
. The Premier, M. Dupuy, said
a decision whether or not to
prosecute the two Deputies ought
to be taken without delay, and
he asked the Chamber to imme
diately appoint a committee with
instructions to report on the sub
ject this evening.. Â ; \
.. M. Laces, . Nationalist, repre

NEW YORK. Feb. 24.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: The cablegram from Ad
miraJ Dewey to-day, asking for the Or
egon, was in the nature of a bombshell
to the administration. Unfortunately
for the authorities. Admiral Dewey
made no explanation of what the "po
litical reasons" were that necessitated
the immediate dispatch of the battle
ship to the Philippines.
Admiral Dewey's message was one of
the principal topics of discussion at the
Cabinet meeting. After the meeting a
member of the Cabinet gave me this
statement in reference to the sensa
tional dispatch from the naval com
mander:
"So far as we know, there is nothing
in the international situation in the
Philippines requiring the presence of
an overwhelming force at Manila-
There is no question pending between
the United States and any foreign gov
ernment relating to the archipelago.
"No complain has been made of the
inability of this Government to pro
tect foreign subjects and their prop
erty, and no intimation has been re
ceived that any foreign government
proposes to submit a claim for dam
ages on account of the destruction of
property in the city.
"It is my opinion, and the President
and other member of the Cabinet view
the matter in the same way, that Rear
Admiral Dewey, in cabling for the Ore
gon, desires to have in the Philippines
a battle ship flying the American flag
which might impress the Filipinos with
the naval power of this country.
"It is true that he has at his dis
posal a large number of smaller ships,
but the moral effect of the presence of
the Oregon would be such that it might
impress the Filipinos with the futility
of resisting a government like the
United States."
Notwithstanding this pacific state
ment on the part of this Cabinet mem
ber, there is an underlying apprehen
sion of trouble, and it is expected that
Admiral Dewey will immediately ac
quaint Secretary Long with the nature
of the "political reasons" which caused
him to request that he be reinforced by
the Oregon.
The Americans have been victorious
In every conflict and the natives suf
fered enormous losses, but it does not
seem to have affected their fanatical
desire to rid themselves of the Ameri
cans. It is pretty certain that Otis will
have to keep on fighting until his army
is increased to such an extent that it
will be able to inaugurate an offensive
campaign against the rebels and com
pletely crush them.
General Corbin said this morning,
after reading the dispatch from Gen
eral Otis, that he was satisfied the
worst was over at Manila, and that the
arrival of the Scandia, together with
the knowledge among the insurgents
that General Lawton with other rein
forcements will speedily appear, will
put an end to their activity. He had
no doubt that the rebels were putting
forth their utmost efforts to drive out
the American force before a large body
of regulars could arrive, as this course
was strongly urged on Aguinaldo by
his agents in Washington, Paris and
Hongkong. These agents expressed the
opinion that unless the Americans
could be defeated before fresh and
thoroughly seasoned troops arrived
they could never be beaten.
So far as is known here the only Ger
man man-of-war in the Philippines is
the Irene, which is at Manila, though
at Hongkong the Germans have the
Kaiserine Augusta and several other
cruisers which might be sent to the
Philippines.
It was stated to-day that Rear Ad
miral Dewey might want the Oregon
because he had learned that the Ger
mans proposed to reinforce the Irene
and he desired to have available a
squadron which would overawe the
German admiral and prevent him from
resuming the high-handed tactics
which he pursued last summer.
It was reported at the department to
day that a large number of German
marines had been landed at Manila, but
neither Secretary Long nor Secretary
Alger had received any official infor
mation on this point at the close of
office hours.
It. is admitted in administration cir
cles that the effect of a large squadron
upon the representatives of foreign
governments in the Philippines would
be excellent, and it may be Admiral
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Dewey had this in view when he sent
his dispatch concerning the Oregon.
Though it was stated at the Navy
Department at the close of office hours
that no instructions had been sent to
the Oregon to expedite her departure
from Honolulu for Manila, it is expect
ed that she will be communicated with,
if possible, by the army steamer leav
ing San Francisco on Sunday. Proba-

MANILA, Feb. 25.-10:15 a. m.
â The foreign Consuls met to
confer regarding commercial In
terests, but the result of their
deliberations has not been com
municated, it is understood, to
the American authorities. The
British Consul was not present
at the conference.
The shooting of two English
men and of Mr. Argentine, man
ager of the Andrews cotton mill
at Tondo, on Wednesday is gen
erally regretted, but it is ad
mitted that it was Q.uJJe una
voidable. Instead of remaining
in the stone basement during the
excitement occasioned by the
fires in ti^p vicinity, the trio
leaned from an upper window.
Their white suits attracted the
attention of the American sol
diers, who, believing them to be
natives firing from the windows,
shot all three. Mr. Argentine is
dead. Mr. Simpson is fatally
wounded and Mr. Haslam
slightly.

LATEST SCANDAL
AROUSES THE IRE
OF HONEST MEN
Indignation in Legislative Circles
Over Attempt to Bribe
Raub.
MOST FLAGRANT OUTRAGE MADE
KNOWN.
Only Lack of Time Prevents a Rigid Investigation
Into Tbis Effort to Debauch an Assemblyman
With an Offer of Office or Money.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 24.â The allegations Â».f
bribery made by Assemblyman C. <:.
Raub against an agent of D. M. Burns
have created a sensation in legislative
circles.
The attempt which was made to cor
rupt the chairman of the Committee on
Corporations of the Assembly was one
of the most flagrant outrages on the
dignity and decency of the Legislature
that has yet come to light. There is
reason to believe that this latest scan
dal in the campaign of the Mexican
will develop incidents far more sen
sational than those which have ap
peared, and that It will be found if the
Assembly chooses to pursue the inves
tlgatli i!, that a prominent State official
is involved in the affair. There was a
feeling of uneasiness In official circles
generally and in the camp of the Mexi
can the customary blustering and
meaningless thivats were made and
unnoticed by those who knew the Mcx â¢
lean and the methods of his campaign
ers.
There is now no longer any question
that the representatives of Dan Burns,
with or without authority, are using
the weapon of State patronage to ad
vantage. Promises of places or their
equivalent in cash are seductive in
ducvments and the tricksters of the
Burns outfit are using them not only
to reduce but to intimidate.
Assemblyman Raub had but very lit
tle further to say In reference to the
attempt that had been made to bribe
him. He declared that there is abso
lutely no question that the man who
approached him so mysteriously and
secretively had full power to act as the
agent of Dan Burns. The man who
made the offer is a recognized cham
pion of the Mexican and^enjoys the lat
ter's confidence in the scheme to win
the Federal Senatorship. No idle inter
ference suggested his offer, therefore,
and Raub knew well that he could de
pend upon the sincerity of the over
tures that were made. Whether or not
the promises could be kept as tar as
the delivery of State patronage is con
cerned is quite another matter that
may be determined by Burns and the
State officers that have assisted him
to the extent of their official positions
1n his fight to disgrace the State. The
offer of a money substitute is another
matter. It is bribery, pure and simple,
and adds another gross outrage to the
history of the scandal and blackguard
ism that Dan Burns has given to Cali
fornia.
There was considerable talk to-day
that the Assembly should institute a
rigid Inquiry, demand the name of the

MENTO. Feb. 24.â Under Senator Smith"s
motion of yesterday the Senate has made
up another file of important measures
â¢which will be taken up and hurrk-d
through after the few bills remaining on
the special urgency file have been dis
posed of.
The Governor's message withdrawing
certain appointments from the considera
tipn of the Senate which had been re
ferred to the Committee on Executive
Communications was reported back with
the recommendation that it be approved.
The report was adopted.
The Governor notified the Senate that
he had vetoed Senate bill 82. providing
for the expending of $7500 in refitting the
office of the State Treasurer. His reason
for vetoing the measure was that there
was no real reason for the appropriation
and, besides, it was made payable out of
this year's funds instead of those of 1900.
Assemblyman White's bill in relation to
the appraisement of the estate of de
ceased persons was passed.
Dibble's Assembly bill 354. prohibiting
the defacing or desecration of the flag
and providing a punishment for any such
defacement, was passed to third reading.
Chynoweth's Assembly bill 399, amend
ing the act governing the organization
ana management of county fire insurance
companies so as to enlarge its powers,
was killed by the striking out of the en
acting clause on motion or Shortridge.
The Committee on Mileage and Attaches
recommended that $142 50 be allowed for
the expenses of the junket to Highland
Asylum in San Bernardino County and
$72 85 be allowed for the Junket to Napa
Asylum. The allowances were passed.
Then Senator Luchsinger offered a res
olution allowing five members of the Com
mittee on Finance and five from the Com
mittee on Prisons and Prison Buildings
to visit San Quentin Prison. There was
considerable opposition on the ground of
uselessness and expense, but the resolu
tion was finally adopted.
Senator Braunhart's pool-selling bill,
which, like Banquo's ghost, will not down,
came up again to-day. There was no con
sideration of the original, because Braun
hart had a substitute and this was intro
duced and ordered to print pending ac
tion. The substitute is practically Sena
tor Dickinson's bill to restart pool-sell
ing, with some of the best features of the
old bill added. The substitute prohibits
pool-selling on any contest except in the
track, inclosure or fair grounds where the
contest is held. Also that any person who
allow* or gives authority to any one to j
make books or who votes for any ordi- j
nance which allows such pool-selling shall i
be guilty of a felony.

for the payment of the bounty on coyote j
scalps. It was In fact the evening session
all by Itself, for there was but little else
than Bcalp bounties treated of In the ora- 1,
man who attempted to bribe Aesem
i blyman Raub and punish the offender
to the full extent of the law. These sug
gestions have not yet taken formal
; shape and it is feared that they will
not, owing to the lateness of the ses
sion and the necessity of postponing
| and probably jeopardizing essential
legislation should an inquiry be held.
The Assembly as a body, however, is
' indignant that a new scandal has been
j added to so much already blotted into
Its history. Heelers of Burns are in
unpleasant presence around the lobbies
and within the railings and all who talk
with them are viewed with disfavor.
Assemblyman Raub was besieged by
his colleagues as well as by newspaper
j men yesterday, all asking for the name
i of him who had attempted to bribe him
lin the interest of Dan Burns. To all
j Assemblyman Raub made the same re
ply. He reiterated the statements he
had made at the caucus of Grant men
! and subsequently to The Call, but he
| positively declined to reveal the iden
â  tity of the man who approached him.
In explanation of this attitude As
; semblyman Raub says that he has
[ known the man for some time and does
not wish to expose him, although the
attempt at bribery was bitterly and
emphatically resented. Raub says that
i his only purpose in making the expose
i was to show to his colleagues and to
j the people of the State generally the
! dishonorable methods that Burns Is
employing in his campaign. Members
of the Legislature have been black
mailed, intimidated and, as far as pos
sible, bribed. They have been offered
place or coin, as in the instance of As
semblyman Raub, and when that failed
| they have been threatened with politl
. cal oblivion as the penalty for their re
fusal to join the forces of Dan Burns.
Assemblyman Raub knows as well as
others that Burns cannot win without
; a caucus and it is known also that out
i side influences upon which the Mexican
is depending are determined that the
caucus shall be held soon or not at all.
This reason explains why such a daring
offer was made to Raub, who has been
! with the Grant forces from the begin
ning and gave no indication that he
was wavering in his allegiance.
Raub, however, will go no further in
his expose than he has already done
unless he is forced to do so by the
proper authorities. Representatives of
Burns content themselves with abus
ing Raub, assuming that vituperative
abuse is legitimate denial. None of the
Mexican's touts are demanding, with
any degree of emphasis, however, to
have Raub name the man who sought
to bribe him. The incident remains an
other scandalous episode in a disgrace
ful campaign fought by the Mexican to
secure an honor that in his possession
would become a reproach to the State
and its people.
Tory that marked the flight of the evening
hours.
With the ears of the scavenger of the
j plains for a subject the Senators waxed
eloquent over the obligation of the State
to pay when it had contracted a debt, and
it was argued that the bounty was a
I legitimate debt and it should be settled
.to the tune of $287,000. Senator Smith
j spoke in favor of the bill and so did
Shortridge and Bettman and Simpson and
I Curtln. Senator Moxehouse objected to
; paying under the appropriation system
j provided for in the bill, and Senator Gil
! lette backed him up. Bulla took the other
' side principally on the matter of pro-
I cedure, for the bill requires that each
claimant shall prove his claim in court
before he Is paid.
Senator Doty was outspoken enough to
say he thought the bill was in the Inter
ests of speculators who had bought up
the claims and hoped to realize on them.
:He pointed to that section of the bill
i which allowed the Attorney General to
â  transfer the suits to Sacramento for trial
! for support of his theory that the poor
i man was not the rrifcn being looked out
j for. Senator Dickinson spoke along the
i same lines.
Senator Laird, who introduced the bill
and was responsible for all the trouble,
closed the debate on the line of "the State
must pay Us debts," and then the bill
went to a vote. The result was 19 to 12,
: and a call of the House was demanded
i and ordered. The necessary two votes
' were secured by the sergeant-at-arms,
and then Morehouse changed his vote
from no to aye. The ballot was an
nounced as being 22 to 11, and then More
house gave notice that to-morrow he
would move for a reconsideration.
WILD COURSE OF
SENATE BILL 56
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 24.â Senate bill 56, Intro
duced by Senator Curtin of Tuolumne
i County, has run like a rolling stone
! through both houses of the Legislature,
; gathering moss In the way of amendments
i hi its erratic course. And It has not yet
found rest.
The bili. as originally submitted. In
creased the salary of the Judges of the
i Superior Court of Tuolumne County from
$3000 a year to $3500.. The- bill was referred
to the Judiciary Committee, where an
amendment was offered to add the Supe
rior Judges of San Francisco County to
those increased, and providing a raise for
thorn from $4000 to $6000; but the amend
ment was lost.
The bill was reported 'back to the Sen
ate as introduced, with the recommenda
tion that it pass. On second reading
Stratton moved to amend by adding the
San Francisco Judges and Increasing
them to $5000. The amendment was car
ried and the bill went to the printer to
have the amendment added.
The amendment was printed and the bill
came back for third reading, when Cutter
moved to amend by striking out the in
creased pay for the San Francisco Judges
and leaving them at their former $4000.
This amendment was carried by a vote
reversing the former action of the Senate,
and again the measure went to the print
er this* time to be pruned down.
Again the bill came back for third read
ing, and again there was an amendment
awaiting It. Stratton wanted to amend
Ly striking out .the $4000 for the San Fran-

Cisco Judges and inserting $5200 instead,
but the amendment was lost, and as orig
inally introduced the bill was passed.
Then the vagrant measure wandered over
to the Assembly and at once began to
accumulate more amendments.
First it was amended by the insertion
of $5000 for San Francisco Judges, and to
them were added Slskiyou from $3500 to
14000, Shasta from $3000 to $3500 and Con
tra Costa with another raise, but Contra
Costa was taken out again. In this shape
the bill passed the Assembly and once
more it straggled back to its original
home, the Senate.
But the Senate would not stand for the
amendments the Assembly had tacked
on. Senator Laird, who had voted against
the San Francisco raise, said Shasta and
Sisklyou did not want a raise, and he be
lieved they had been put in there so he
would vote for the amended bill. He voted
"no" anyway. All the Assembly amend
ments were voted down, and now a con
ference committee, composed of Senators
Cutter. Davis and Sims, has been ap
pointed to confer with a similar commit
tee from the Assembly in order to- settle
Sn, jus ,\, how muoh the already overworked
bill will stand.
All this explains why the session of the
Legislature Is expected to last well into
iV3 ELTCII.
SHALL THE PEOPLE
VOTE FOR SENATOR ?
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 24.â The resolution by Cam
inetti of Amador asking: that the States
of the Union be memorialized to ask Con
grops for a constitutional amendment
that will permit the election of United
States Senators by direct vote of the peo
ple was this morning the subject of as
Interesting a debate as has been heard in
the Assembly during this present session.
In defense of the resolution were lined
up Caminetti, Mead and Valentine of Los
Angeles. Opposed to it were Grove L.
Johnson. Judgo Dibble of San Francisco,
I Belshaw of Contra Costa and Melick of
Los Angeles.
Mr. Caminetti explained the course of
procedure that would be followed should
his resolution be adopted. He said it was
the law of the land that If two-thirds of
the States should call upon Congress for
such enactment as he proposed Congress
would be obliged to action. When
the required number of Stales call upon
Congress it ceases to be an appeal and
becomes a mandate. The Senate, he said,
was of course opposed to such an-amend
ment, but it was the opinion in Con
gress that the country s constitution
should be so changed.
In speaking to the resolution Johnson
of Sacramento said he for one dfd not
care to go on record as Raying that the
men who go into political conventions
were of higher order and greater honor
than the men who make up the State
Legislatures. "California," said he, "has
been represented In the Senate by good
men and it is not true that a poor man
can no longer be elected. Stephen M.
White is an example of the poor man who
ELEPHANT: "WELL, I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT FOR THE CARTOONIST,"
has been elected to the Senate, and Steph
en M. White is a poor man."
The resolution, he declared, amounted to
the calling of a convention to amend the
constitution framed by Thomas Jefferson
and his great confreres. In these trou
blous times it would be a grave error to
call such a convention.
Those who tried to control a Legisla
ture in the election of a United States
Senator would use the same methods in
trying to influence a convention. The
remedy for the evil of corruption was to
prohibit the use of money in the pri
maries, the convention and the campaign.
The whole harm was done before the Leg
islature met, and not afterward, and the
bill the speaker had introduced prohibit
ing the use of money In Senatorial cam
paigns would remedy the evil.
Belshaw said that in nominating con
ventions combinations are possible that
could not exist In a Legislature, and that
they could be so manipulated that a nom
inee could be foisted upon the people
whom the people did not want, but for
whom they would have to vote or desert
their party-
Mead (D.) of Los Angeles said that
he was in favor of the resolution for the
reason that when a Legislature was to
be nominated in a Senatorial year the
question was not so much upon the can
didates' capacity for law-making as upon
whom they would vote to make Senator.
In this way, he said, the Legislature
became a machine for the making of a
Senator, to which the manufacturing of
laws was a secondary proposition.
Valentine (R.) of Los Angeles strongly
backed the stand taken by Mead. He de
nied that the peoole wouul be compelled
to swallow the candidate nominated in
convention. Under the present system
of elections the people, by petition, could
procure their own candidate. To-day Cal
ifornia stood disgraced before the people
of the United States.
The people of the State of California
wanted to vote directly for Senator, and
the Legislature of the State was com
posed of men who were presumed to
represent the people.
The people of the United States were
entitled to vote on the proposition as to
whether or not the election of a United
States Senator should be left to them.
There was a deadlock to-day in Califor
nia over the election of a Senator, and
this would be impossible if the people
were allowed to make the choice.
The resolution was finally so amended
that at the convention which it called for
only the one proposed amendment can be
considered, and the door not thrown open
to a wholesale breaking up of the con
stitution. To-morrow it will come up for
final action.

conference held by Senator Bulla with his
followers at 6 o'clock. As on Monday last,
Mr Bulla announced before adjournment
was taken this afternoon In the Senate
and the Assembly that he had something
to say to his followers, and he invited
them' all to his quarters at the Golden
He reiterated his statement of the oth
er day that he could no longer hope to
win, and he wanted to arrange against
the time when the break would come. He
said that he had come here to Sacramen
to pledged to eleot a southern man Sena
tor if it could be done and if he could
not win himself he wanted to throw his
strength to Thomas R. Bard, who was a
tit man for the position and very popuiar
south of the Tehachapi. He was careful
to explain that he did not care to influ
ence the course of his adherents after
he had cast loose from them, but that
if they had no other leanings it would be
pleasing to hfm if they wDuld drop in be
hind the Venturan.
Senator Bulla. however, had a string on
his proposition. He did not want to
!<lve in unless he could get a half dozen
or so of the crowd just now voting- for
Ulysses S. Grant. Come what may. Grant
Is the last man that Bulla wants to elect.
Even if he retires from the Senatorial
race he will still be a conspicuous figure
in the situation and will use his energies
in the San Diegan's defeat. He knows
that there are men among Grant's follow
ers who are practically pledged to Bard,
and that If Bard sets them Grant's
chances of election will be even more re
mote than now. If he cannot start
Grant's forces breaking for Bard he will
stay in the fight to keep Grant out.
To the plan broached by Bulla to-night
all of his followers practically agreed.
They are willing to swing to the new
Richmond in the field if they can get
company for their trip over, and they
are looking for it in the Grant camp, and
a prominent figure in the scheme said to
night that he did not think they would
have much trouble in doing it judging
from the way some of the Grant people
are talking.
"Ever since Greenwell of Ventura
went over the other day there has been
a feeling of unrest in one section of the
Grant layout," he said, "and I think there
will be somethingdoing over there before
many days. Dan Burns is allthat is hold
ing that crowd together. They cannot
agree to go in a bunch to any one and
they do not want to take a chance on
Burns picking up any of the stragglers.
Bulla will try and show them the way to
go and from what a number of them have
said to me lately I think our little exodus
is not far off."

CALL. HEADQUARTER^, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 24.â Opinion that impor
tant events will occur next week is
gaining strength to-night. The candi
dates for Senators themselves expect
that something will happen. The call
for a conference of Republicans next
Monday at 4 p. m. elicits some com
ment, although the conditions proposed
are suo+i as will prohibit discussion on
the merits of aspirants. The Grant
men are very shy of the scheme, fear
ing that there is a Mexican in the wood
pile. The promoters of the conference
aver that the suggestion did not ema
nate from the Burns camp, but was pro
moted by a desire to do something to
bring about an agreement among Re
publicans. If the exchange of views
leads to the conclusion that Grant and
Burns should retire from the field for
the good of the Republican party, a
recommendation to that effect may be
presented.
Senator Bulla was asked this even
ing if there was any truth in the re
port circulated to-day that there was
an effort to bring about a consolida
tion of the Grant forces with his own.
He replied that he had not been ad
vised of such a movement. The Bulla
men held a caucus or conference to
night. The only absentee was Assem
blyman Belshaw and he sent word that
he would abide by the decision of his
fellow supporters of the Los Angeles
Senator. After considerable talk, the
conference appointed Senator Gillette
and Assemblyman Valentine as a com
mittee to confer with candidates for
the Senate with a view of effecting
some sort of an agreement whereby a
Senator acceptable to the people may
be chosen. It is the opinion of Sena
tor Bulla that important changes will
occur about the middle of next week.
Thomas R. Bard of Ventura left here
for San Francisco this afternoon, but
will return next Monday or Tuesday.
Mr. Bard is in the hands of his friends,
so to speak, and they have doubtless
advised him that Sacramento will be a
dull place from Saturday afternoon un
til Monday morning.
The votes for Johnson o>n the first bal
lot in joint convention were cast by
Senators Cutter and Leayitt and As
eemblymen De Lancie, Dibble, Henry,
Knights, Knowland, La Baree, Lardner,
Merrill, Miller of San Francisco, Kaub,
Robinson and Valentine.
Phil Crhnmins arrived from San
Francisco this evening to look after
some matters of legislation in which he
is interested. He was asked late to
night if he had paid a visit to Colonel
Burns this evening, and replied that he
had not. He did not express any opin
ion as to the outcome of the Senatorial
struggle, but indicated that he was sat
isfied with the action of his friends in
supporting Colonel Burns.
The promise of an appointive office to
Raub in case he would enter a caucus
raises a deal of conjecture as to the
extent of patronage promises in the in
terest of Burns. No doubt many prom
ises are out respecting legislative meas
ures. In this connection the testimony
of Lamberson, which was not fully con
sidered by the members of the Legis
lature In the rush of exciting events,
is doubly interesting now. Lamberson,
in talking with a Burns man, was told
that unless members of the Legislature
lined up for Burns they would not
get their bills considered. It is ob
served now that Dibble is getting in po
sition to grasp legislation in the As
sembly, and as he is known to be one
of the ablest and most audacious of
Burns' supporters every move that he
makes ought to be closely studied. The
representatives of the people in the
Legislature have practically won this
fight against Burns, the machine and
the railroad and should not be tricked
out of the victory in the closing hours
of the session.
The signs of a secret caucus are
growing smaller by degrees and the
deadlock is as firm as ever. During the
past forty-eight "hours strong efforts
have been made on the quiet to effect a
reconciliation of the Grant and Bulla
forces, with the purpose of swinging.the
Bulla men into the Grant camp. Strong
appeals have been made to â¢ sectional
pride in order to attain the coalition.
The feeling at one time between these
factions was very bitter, but it has been
to some degree allayed recently, but
whether it can be subdued to the extent
of bringing about a solid front of the
southern men is not clear. It is claimed
here that the influence of Senator Per
kins has been invoked to help an ad
justment of affairs on the lines pro
posed.
No doubt the administration has ex
pressed to Senator Perkins a desire for
the election of a Republican United
States Senator from California. The
result can be speedily attained when
Burns and Grant retire from the field.
The sentiment against either boss or
boodle rule is stronger to-day than it
was at the beginning of the session.
A box of salve for wounded feelings
was opened at the joint convention to
day. There was a little arrangement
made by Republicans who sympathize
with Grove L. Johnson to give him
some complimentary votes for the office
of United States Senator. The affair
was arranged by Senator Cutter and
Assemblymen Dibble and Valentine. A
small detachment was drawn from each
of the leading Senatorial camps to
make up fourteen votes. Three votes
were drawn from Barnes, four from
Bulla, three from Burns and four from
Grant. The Democrats, hearing of the
movement, fancied that it would be in
accord with the eternal fitness of things
to seize the opportunity to indorse Wil
liam R. Hearst, and accordingly they
gave him twenty-eight votes "right off
the reel." The convention hastened to
call for another ballot in order to bring
the scattered forces back to their re
spective stations. Hearst got twice as
many votes as Johnson, but Johnson
made up in applause what he lacked in
votes. It is suggested now that Wright,
Jilson and Simpson should each be vin
dicated by a complimentary \*ote. The
vindication though brief is cheap, and
should be passed around to Los An
geles, Alameda and Siskiyou.
The talk is heard along the Senato
rial line that there will be "something
doing next week." It is certain that a
vigorous effort will be put forward to
Induce the legislators from Southern
California to rally round the standard
of Thomas R. Bard of Ventura. Irving
M. Scott is still in the field with two
votes, and stands ready to welcome ac
cessions when the inevitable break
comes.
. The supporters of General Barnes are
firm and confident. They cite the .fact
that the General has not lost a man
since the fight opened and has achieved
a- gain of four, a larger gain than any
other candidate can show. â  Burns has
not yet lost a man, but has gained only
three votes since the first ballot was
taken. Â..-â  . -j .".--â . ; - '
The prolongation of the contest until
the pay of legislators stops is now fore
shadowed. The honest men realize that
there will be danger to the cause of
clean politics and able representation In
the Senate when that time comes. It
Is suggested -that the stanch .and true
men of the Legislature who are fighting
a gallant battle. for the people and the
fair name of the" State should be urged
to remain here to the finish and resist
the election of any unworthy man. Pro
vision will be made for the touts to re
main here, but If members of the Leg
islature who have business affairs at
home requiring attention should leave
from time to time during the 'closing
days of the session the number of votes
necessary for a choice will daily dimin

APPROPRIATIONS
IS INTRODUCED
Only One or Two Radical Changes From the
Old Measure.
STATE PRINTING IS THE FEATURE.
Each Department Is to Pay for Its Own Work Oat of a
Special Fund That Is Considered Sufficient to .
Carry It on Two Years.
:. CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- |
IJENTO, Feb. 24.â After a month of the j
hardest kind of work. Chairman Valen
tine of the Ways and Means Committee
got the general appropriation bill intro
duced in the Assembly this evening.
From a comparative standpoint, it is not i
B. remarkable document. It carries but j
one or two radical changes from the am- !
Hibus bill of ISTT; none of the funds of
Btate institutions are severely sliced,
neither have any of them been Increased
to a noticeable extent.
â¢ The military appropriation Is increased
enough so as to cover the expense of the â 
' iiew naval battalion. The district agri
cultural societies were the greatest suf
ferers under the pruning knife. They were
fell cut down from $500 to $2000 less than j
â  the figures of previous years. Governor ;
' Gage's pin money fund â officially desig
nated as his secret service fundâ remains
the' same, $10,000. but a slight reduction
is made in the amount allowed him with i
which to pay State rewards for the appre- |
hension of criminals.
The feature of the bill that is unusual is
the product of .the fertile brain of Valen- j
â  tine himself. It carries no appropriation
' for the State printing office, saving of :
course the salary of State Printer John- ;
â ton.
Instead each of the State departments is .
allowed a sufficient sum to pay for the â¢
printing it may need during the two fis- I
cal years to come and each shall have its j
printing done at the State office ami pay
for it out of the funds so provided.
Last year's appropriation, whie^i was j
vetoed by Governor Budd, amounted to
$270.0u0; the aggregate of printing funds
carried in the bill this year amounts to
about the same figure.
â¢It is evident that some agreement ha 3
b^fcn arrived at between Governor Gage
and the Legislature with regard to the '
: funds for district agricultural fairs. I-.-i
session there was a tacit agreement in the
.. Legislature to pass both the appropriation
ft>r the State fair and the appropriations
..'for the agricultural districts. If one could
not be passed then the other should not j
be. Both bills were to stand or fall to-
f ether. Both were passed, but Governor
liidd vetoed the district apportionment j
end eft the State fund. A mighty howl
..went up from the rural districts forth- i
â¢.â with. This year it is understood that j
both items will receive the Governor's
J sanction, although the district apropri.i- :
tions have been cut down approximately
one-third to -meet Governor Gsge's irtea
of economy. -â â =- â¢"â ' ;'â â¢-!

The amount allowed for salaries In the
6tate Bureau of Highways is but $WOO, a
reduction of 512.000. made necessary be
cause of the fact that two of the offices ,
In the commission are to be abolished. |

small one. The per diem and salary of
the Lieutenant Governor and Senators ;
figures $21,500; Assemblymen, $42,000.
For the pay of the attaches- of the Sen- j
â  ate $21 o<io is "allowed. $3000 more than last .
year The Assembly is allowed for the i
game purpose $2* .500. Last session's ap- !
propriation was $21.00-1 The appropria- j
. tlbns of IS?7 were based on the Belshaw I
law and figured for sixty days. This j
year the Belshaw act is dead and the per
"diem is figured on a seventy-day basis. :
Following is the bill in brief:

<Â£ S^^nfiB^ 'i mother enjoys
\~\ ~\J^^ good general

-health, she will have a child with a robust
body, an alert brain and vigorous health.
You cannot expect such a child from a
weak, sickly, nervous, despondent woman,
who- is'broken down by derangements and
disease of the distinctly feminine organs.
A woman in that condition is almost sure
to have a puny, sickly, peevish baby.' Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription is the best
preparation for motherhood. It relieves
maternity of its dangers, and of almost all
â¢its- pain. It restores the delicate and im-
portant organs that bear the brunt of ma-
ternity to perfect health and strength, and
assists the regular and healthful perform-
ance of all the natural functions. It ban-
ishes the ailments of the critical period,
arid makes baby's debut easy and almost
painless. It insures the little new-comer's
health. ; Thousands have testified to its
Bents.' Good medicine dealers sell it, and
honest druggist will insult your intelli-
gence by urging upon you something else
â¢as "just as good." The "just as good"
kind is dear at any price.
" Mrs F. B. Cannings, of No, 4320 Humphrey
Street St. Louis, Mo., writes : "I am now the
â¢ happy mother of a fine, healthy baby girl. I
feel that your ' Favorite Prescription ' has done
me more Rood than anything I have ever taken

STRATTON PRIMARY BILL
WILL BECOME A LAW
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 24.â The Governor had the
Stratton Primary Law under considera
tion this evening, in conference with the
author and T. V. I ator. The general pro-
Vision* were approved with the exception
of the one providing a fine of $25 or its
equivalent in Imprisonment for any fail
ure of a duly appointed election officer to
act This was considered too severe, but
the' changing of the bill would necessitate
a reconsideration by both houses. The
difficulty was overcome by an agreement
to draw tip a bill providing for_ the repeal
of the section setting forth the punish
ment and this will be put through both
houses i and signed by the Governor. In
the meantime the Stratton Primary bill
will be signed and will become a law.
Fighting the Placerville Bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 24.â Judge Williams of Pla
cervllle appeared before the Senate Ju
diciary Committee this afternoon and
spoke in opposition to the Placerville bill,
which was before that body. He spoke
against the measure in strong terms,
stating that if the bill went into effect it
would virtually place the town of Placer
ville in the hands of an unscrupulous and
grinding railroad monopoly. Last even
ing Drury Melone, the Napa capitalist,
appeared before the committee and spoke
in favor of the bill, which. If it goes
through, will benefit him greatly
The bill is to provide for the filling of
vacancies of the offices of cities where
there has been a failure to elect the lama
by tfca pÂ«oplo for more than, two years.
The bill directly applies to Placervllle. It
seems that in the early part of 1863 the
town of Placerville was greatly In need
of a railroad and the Sacramento Rail
road Company agreed to furnish them
one from the terminus of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, which was then at El
Dorado, to Placerville, if the town would
bond itself to the company for half the
expense of the construction of the road.
I The people of Placerville kept their
j agreement, but the railroad company
failed to ke>> theirs, for they made the
terminus of the road at Folsom. about
twenty miles from Placerville. Since then
â¢ the town has been evading the election
of officers, for in electing them it would
throw itself open to suit for the payment
of the bonds. The committee reported
the bill back to the Senate without rec
! ommendation. and it will probably be
fought with vigor by a number of Sena
, tors.

SECRETARY LONG
REPLIES TO SCHLEY
Practically Accuses the Bear Admiral
of Having Made Misstate
ments.
NSW YORK. Feb. 24 âA Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long, it is understood, has prepared a
statement in answer to that of Rear Ad
miral Sehley which will be sent to the
Senate if. asked for by that body. It la
believed the Secretary- calls Attention to
what the department deems mlsstate
ments in the rear admiral's communica
tion..- , â .
The department is specially aggrieved
over that feature of Schiey's defense in
which be asserts that in accordance with
the department's orders of May 27 he did
go to Santiago and blockade the harbor.
and that the Spanish fleet did not leave
without a decisive action.
The officials complain that Rear Admi
ral Sehley said nothing about his dispatch
that on' account of weather, the shortage
of coal and the difficulty of coaling from
a collier hÂ» would be compelled to disobey
the orders of the Secretary and go to
Key West. While the authorities admit
that the flying squadron went to San
tiago they say it did not do so until May
Â°9 forty-eigbi hours after the receipt
of the Secretary's orders
Secretary Long said this afternoon that
no court of Inquiry would be ordered for
the present, and. as the Herald stated this
morning, none would be ordered until af
ter the adjournment of Congress.
VICIOUS CONVICT
ATTEMPTS MURDER
SAX QfUBNTIN PRISON. Feb. 24.â The
jutemill was the scene of a fierce combat
between two prisoners te-day, and a mur
der was prevented only by the vigilance
of the guards. The contestants were H.
Silkins. who is serving five years for a
burglary committed in Los Angeles, and
J Baker, serving the same time for grand
larceny from Kern County. Silkins was
slashed on the right cheek with a knife.
but the wound is not considered serious.
Warden Hale exercises the most rigid
discipline in the Jutemill, for it is there
that most of the serious quarrels have
their origin. A constant watch is kept
to prevent the men obtaining possession
of a deadly weapon, but Baker had torn
a small pair of shearsâ the kind used in
cutting twine â in two and sharpened one
of the blades to a razor edge. As soon
as the quarrel became heated he sprang
at Silkins and stabbed him In the cheek.
He was thrown down and disarmed be
fore he could inflict further injury.
Silkins' wound was dressed by Dr. Law
lor the prison physician, and Baker was
hauled off to the dungeon, where he will
remain in solitary confinement until the
next meeting of the Board of Prison Di
rectors. It is probable he will then be de
prived of all his credits.

band, has taken a lesson from the worm
and turned upon her enemies. She feels
the bitterest resentment for Miss Matilda.
Lutzone, a cook formerly in the employ

other inflammables into the "Dally Sup
ply" store between the hours of 9:30 and

Tn company with Attorney Coehrane,
Mrs. Young and James J. Daly, a witness
for the defense, appeared before Justice
Gardner to-day ana Daly swore to a war
runt charging 'the co->k with perjury. The
complaint alleges that she willfully and
fnlsely swore to what she knew was not
the truth as regards the whereabouts of
Mrs. Young on the night of the fire. The
warrant was placed In the hands of Sher
iff Tavlor for service In the morning.
Mrs "Young went to Pan Francisco this
evening by wav of Sausallto avoiding
Tiburon. DistriW Attorney Mclsaac said
this evening he did not believe Miss Lut

A CALL FOR A CONFERENCE
IS THE LATEST SCHEME
S3 CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO. Feb. 24.â A conference of S3
â¦ . Republican legislators Is the very latest method advocated as a way to â¦
â¢3 break the deadlock and elect a United States Senator. It Is a plan that Â»
<i some members who have been opposing the election" of Dan Burns may jj
X accept in good faith, and which all of Burns' followers will enter into with +
*8 a rush because they see In it a preliminary step to a secret caucus, which S3
*â¢ is now the only remaining peg upon which Burns may hang his hopes of a
â¦ the toga. â¦
Â»* The call for the conference, together with the names of the five Sen- Â«3
gÂ» ators who issued it. is as follows: â¢ g*
â¦ Whereas. It Is nearing the end of the legislative session . and there has â¦
*Â£ been no election of a United States Senator, and y
5 "Whereas, It Is the duty of the Republican members of this session to g
â¦ elect a United States Senator, or at least to leave nothing undone that is hon- *
S5 orable to accomplish this end. and â¦*
â¦ Whereas, A general conference might, assist In arriving at the desired re- â¦
53 suit, and In the hope that, by an interchange of ideas, progress may be J5
4 niade toward a solution of the question, we hereby signify our assent to at- 4
5Â» tend such a conference, to be held in the Supreme Court room on Monday. $5
4 the 27th day of February, at 4p. m.. an* with the distinct .understanding and â¦
g<s agreement at such conference â 88
â¦ 1. That only Republican members of this Legislature shall be present. +
t Â» ' 2. That no particular candidate's candidacy shall be advocated. gg
â¦ 3. That no vote shall be taken as to any candidate, or upon any nomina- 4
gg tion, with distinct understanding that nothing done and no vote taken shall S3

V . On its face the scheme appears to be Innocent enough, but there are V
am' many legislators who profess to see in it a clever move to bring about a S3
4 Senatorial caucus and the election of Dfin Burns. One of these is Senator &
S3 Cutter, who is recognized as one of the wisest members of the Grant V
â¦ following: ; ; ; 88
â¦ "It is all rot and rubbish." he said to-day, "and Is only a step toward â¦
Â«8 a caucus. What good can such a conference do? We meet each day in *5
X joint assembly, in the corridors and on the streets. Each man knows A
V â¢ how the other man stands. We could meet In conference and talk to the #
S3 end of time with no result so far as our votes for' Senator are concerned. *3
Â£ This is simply a scheme to bring about a caucus, and I will have noth- Â£
â¦ Ing to do with it." ; Â«; â  â  â¦
*â¢ There are others who are of the same way of thinking as Senator S3
Â£ Cutter, and it may be that there will not be enough signatures to the peti-
V tion secured to Justify the holding of the proposed conference.
88 Senators Morehouse and Dickinson, who are the prime movers In the gj
â¦ conference scheme, emphatically deny that it was Inspired by Burns, or â¦
** that it is being advocated In the hope that any particular candidate will S3
*â reap a benefit. They say that the sole object In view la a general discus- â¦
V pton of present conditions in the Senatorial situation to the end that some S3
Â£5 plan may be devised for the election of a United States Senator who will â¦
â¦ be acceptable to the people of the State. One of the plans that will be y
S3 discussed is for the withdrawal of both Grant and Burns from the contest. jÂ»

IMPROVEMENT PLANS
FOR THE MISSION
PBXSPEB.TY-OWNEBS ANT> MEE-
CHANTS UNITED.
A Neglected Section to Be Brought
Into Municipal Prominence in
the Near Future.
The Mission, so called, which embodies :
the Eleventh Ward under the consolida
tion act, comprises one-third of the area
of San Francisco, and which pays taxes ,
upon property heretofore unheard of ex
cept It be to the Assessor and Tax Col- i
lector, is not going to remain in its pio
neer Innocence and virgin condition any
longer. Within the past few months sev
eral clubs or organizations have been
formed, consisting of property-owners and
tenants throughout the Mission district,
for the purpose of bringing about a gen
eral line of improvements all along the
entire Mission district from Twelfth j
street to the county line. Enrolled In ;
these various organizations are the west
of Castro street. Sunnyside, Glen Park,
Ocean View, Mission road and Five-Mile
House, Mission Union Improvement Club,
Fairmount Improvement Club. Precita
Valley Improvement Club, Mission League |
of Improvement Clubs, and last but not ,
least, the Mission Merchants' League, re- '
cently formed on Valencia street. One ]
and all of these clubs are organized for
the purpose of advancing the interest of
the Mission district. Some of the clubs
are for building hospitals, others are for
the repavement of business streets, oth
era for purchasing vacant lots to be con
verted into public parks and pleasure
grounds, while still others are for the ,
extension of sewers and the grading of
streets through territory heretofore un
improved. But one and all are for the
improvement of the Mission from
Twelfth street to the county line.
The advocates of these general improve- i
ments picture to their hearers at the va
rtoua club meetings the splendor and ele- '
gance* of the Western Addition us com- j
pared with the Mission proper. At the '
time the Western Addition was a howling
wilderness of sand dunes and cemeteries |
the Mission was a tax-paying district.
From the industry of the property-owners
in the Mission district the wild lots of the
Western Addition have been improved
and made profitable to those who own :
property therein. Parks, boulevards and
bituminized streets have been added to :
the attractions of the Western Addition,
while the Mission has been left in its nor- '
mal condition with "nigger-headed" cob- :
ble-stones and wooden sidewalks. Xo i
parks, no boulevards and very few bitu- \
minized streets are to be found within
the entire area of the Eleventh Ward.
To bring about a revolution in this re
gard is thf- object of the various improve- \
ment clubs recently started in this section
of the city.
To acquire the two cemetery lots oppo
site the Mission High School for a public
park is one of the objects in view. This
site, sheltered as it is under the brow of I
the Twin Peaks, free from fogs and chill- !
ing winter winds, is. in the opinion of the
great majority o.f the Mission people, an :
ideal spot prepared by nature for a botan- I
ical garden. Others there are who want j
the "flatlron" â¢'West Mission streeO |
turned into a little park and the ola ram
shackle wooden buildings burned down !
or removed.
The property-owners and residents of i

NEARLY DIED IN A
FIT OF SNEEZING
PECULIAR MISHAP BEFALLS AN
ALAMEDA MEECHANT.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 24.â John Hansen. who
occupies a prominent place among the
young business men of this city, nearly
sneezed himself to death a few days ago.
The tissues of his brain were Injured by
the attack, and for some time the young
man's condition was considered critical.
The most serious injury he sustained was
a rupture of the drum of the left ear.
Mr. Hansen was at work in his office
last Tuesday when â¢he felt a chill come
over him and commenced to sneeze. At
first he thought he had caught a slight
cold, but the sneezing continued for
nearly an hour and increased in severity
until Hansen collapsed from exhaustion
and had to be taken to his home on Eagle
avenue, where medical assistance was
summoned. The young man remained in
a comatose state for many hours, the
physicians ascribing his condition to in
juries to the organs of the head brought
about by the paroxysm. When he re
gained consciousness he complained of
violent pains in his head. Upon examina
tion it was discovered that the drum of
his left ear had been injured and his hear
ing somewhat impaired. His eyesight,
which had previously been perfect, was
also slightly affected, but the doctors
state that the injury will only be tem
porary.

DISMISSAL OF
MEREDITH HAS
BEEN ORDERED
Upon the Report of Special
Agents, Major Moore May
Also Have to Go,
Call Office, ~Rlggs House,
Washington, Feb. 24.
The indications are that Major Moore
â¢will have to go also. The report of
Special Agents Llnck and Smith can
not be Ignored. It substantiates prac
tically all that The Call has printed,
about Moore's relations with type
writers and other women. Assistant
Secretary Howell has not yet con
sidered Moore's case, but the recom
mendation of the Supervising- Special
Agent, Mr. Chance, will be that Moore
be relieved from duty. Mr. Chance de
clined to discuss Moore's case, but The
Call correspondent learned from an
other treasury official to-night that this
will be Chance's recommendation.
There is no doubt that it will be car
ried out by Assistant Secretary Howell.
When seen to-nigh"t the latter was
willing to discuss Meredith's case, but
said he had not had time to examine
the report in the case of Moore, that it
was now on his desk and he might be
able to; examine it to-morrow. Con
cerning Meredith, he said: â¢"The report
of Special Agents Linck and Smith cor
roborated Moore's charges against
Meredith. There is no doubt in our
minds that he was not a good officer
and should not have been intrusted
with the Chinese bureau duties. The
letter directing that he be relieved from
duty is en route to San Francisco and
should reach there in the course of a
few days. It is brief, does not enter
into the history of the case nor the
findings, but merely directs his dis
missal for cause."
"Does the fact that Moore's charges
against Meredith were sustained mdi- I
rate that Mr. Moore will ba exoner- I
ated?"
"By no means," replied Assistant !
Howell, "for the charges against Moore ;
are of entirely a different nature and I
have nothing whatever to do with
Meredith's case. Moore was charged i
with conducting himself in an ungentle- j
manly way with women."
"Would the department feel Justified j
in taking cognizance of such matters j
provided his official duties had been
performed satisfactorily. In other j
words, would these charges (if sus- i
talned) be considered sufficient ground i
for his removal?"
"I think so," said Howell. "But re
member that I have not yet seen the
report in Major Moore's case, and con
sequently do not know what action I
shall take."
Supervising Special Agent Chance
was then' seen. He said that propriety
forbade his discussion of Major Moore's |
case until the Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury has examined the report.
"Have you examined it yourself?"
"Yes."
"Will you make- any recommendation
to Assistant Secretary Howell?"
"Probably so," said he. "It is a part
of my duty."
Mr. Chance spoke of these recom
mendations as "unpleasant duties." all
of which indicates beyond doubt that
Major Moore will also have to walk
the plank.
The report of Agents Linck and
THE BULGARIA
REACHES PORT
Was Believed to Have
Cone Down.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
PONTA DELGADA, Feb. 24.â The
Hamburg-American line steamer Bul
garia, Captain Schmidt, from New
York on January 2S for Hamburg, pre
viously reported in great di?tress by the
British steamer "Weehawken, 800 miles
from the Azores Islands, entered this
port this morning under her own steam
and reported all well on board.
Subsequent to the departure of Sec
ond Mate G. Scharges and three others
of the crew who were picked up at sea
by the British steamship Vittorla and
landed at Baltimore, the weather be
came worse and salvage operations had
to be abandoned. All day and night
the crew and passengers of the Bulga
ria jettisoned cargo until February 7.
During the afternoon of February 7
â William Koenig, a sailor, jumped over
board and was never seen again.
The weather on the morning of Feb
ruary S is described as fearful, and
there was six or seven feet of water in
the hold. On the morning of February
9 the weather became calm, and 107
dead horses were thrown overboard.
The swell was very high until February
10. By that time No. 4 hold, which was
full of grain, had fourteen feet of water
in it and the pumps were foul and un
able to work.
Stormy weather recommenced on the
afternoon of February 11 and lasted
until February 14, when the British
steamer Antillian, Captain Fost. from
Liverpool on February 4 for New Or
leans, appeared. The commander of
the Bulgaria asked the captain of the
Antillian to take the disabled steamer
In tow. This the captain of the An
tillian tried to do and a hawser was
made fast between the two steamers
between 7 and 8 o'clock that mornine.
but at noon the hawser carried away.
The Antillian succeeded in again tak
ing the Bulgaria in tow, but once more
the hawser carried away. The Antil
lian stood by the Bulgaria until the
morning of February 15, when she pro
ceeded on her voyage.
In the meantime the crew of the
Bulgaria had been working Incessantly
in efforts to repair the disabled rudder
of the steamer, and at 10 o'clock on the
morning of February 21 the Bulgaria
was again under control. By noon of
February 22 she had made 226 miles,
-and at noon on February 23. 240 miles
more had been covered. The balance
of the distance here, 194 miles, was cov
ered by 7:30 this morning.
During the storms and in workinc:
the passengers and crew of the Bul
garia sustained many injuries, a num
ber of arms and legs being broken.
Prizes for Historical Essays.
BROOKLINE. Mass., Feb. 24.â The
Daughters of the American Revolution i
have offered prizes for the best essays on
American history by students of colleges .
that admit women, Leiand Stanford Jr. j
VciverÃlty included.
Smith alludes especially to the case of
Fong Suey Wan, a Chinese procuress,
and other Chinese who were captured
In that raid, and shows that Meredith
allowed Fong Suey Wan to escape, not
withstanding the fact that evidence
had been put in his possession showing
that she was guilty of felony.
Assistant Secretary Howell said to
night that even Collector Jackson was
now of the opinion that Meredith was
at fault.
The report of the special agents in
Moore's case furnishes much evidence
adduced in San Francisco tending' to
show that the major had on various
occasions made. Improper advances to
women, as alleged in The Call.
Collector Jackson said yesterday that
he received no information as to the al
leged dismissal from the service of
Benjamin E. Meredith, chief of the
Chinese bureau. He said that Mr.
Meredith was attending to his duties as
usual, and that neither of them had re
ceived any news from Washington.
Special Agents Linck and Smith said
that their report must have arrived in
Washington last Thursday, but that
they had not heard what disposition
1 had been made of it. There was a large
! mass of reliable evidence against Mere
dith tending to show that Meredith de
i sipnedly allowed Fong Suey Wan, the
I noted procuress, to slip through his
I fingers after he had been warned by
: Miss Cameron of the Presbyterian Mis
| sion and several other persons that she
I would be brought into court and dis
â  charged on her certificate of landing.
| It was also shown that he had engaged
| at various times as interpreter Harry
! Huff, a man who had the reputation of
i owning one or two Chinese slave girla
j in Chinatown.
The recommendation of the agents,
I together with the evidence submitted,
! were that Meredith had been guilty of
willful neglect of duty in failing to
! prefer the proper charges against Fong
! Suey Wan, and that his failure to do
bo was reprehensible and inexcusable.
Another charge against Meredith was
i that he had been guilty of conduct un
! becoming a gentleman and Federal offi
i cial in that he had used vile, profane
i and insulting language to a member of
I the press and to Dr. Gardner, at the
' time en official interpreter for the bu
reau. The testimony showed that Mere
| dith was of an overbearing and testy
j disposition while at the head of the
bureau, and that he resented a sugges
tion from any of his subordinates as an
impertinence. On one occasion, when
Dr. Gardner suggested something in
the line of suppressing the notoriou8 f
traffic in and landing of coolie slaves
and contract laborers, Meredith re
warded his zeal by calling him an im
pertinent puppy and ordering him out
I of the office on pain of being kicked out.
Dr. Gardiner, being a man of peace,
likewise a preacher of the gospel of
good will, did not wait to be kicked,
but he has the consolation of knowing
that some unkicked kicks come home to
roost.
The evidence against Major Moore
j was overwhelming. He confessed to his
assault upon Mrs. Pickens. The agents
expressed the opinion that he is insane
j at times and on certain subjects, and
the Treasury Department will no doubt
take the fact into consideration when
passing sentence upon him.
REV. DR. CRABB
WOOED HER NOT
Miss Perry Denies the
Impeachment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, - Feb. 24.â Miss Carrie
Perry, who Dr. Crabb declared had
been thrown in his way by a special
act of divine providence to receive his
ardent love, was the chief attraction in
the Crabb divorce case to-day. She
was petite, pretty and modest, and she
denied that the revei'end doctor had
ever wooed her.
There was a falling off in attendance,
still there was the usual coterie of fe
male admirers of the minister at the
trial. No one appears to console
and comfort Mrs. Crabb, yet the little
, woman bears up wonderfully well.
The question of the admission of a
part of the written confession by Dr.
Crabb that he loved Miss Perry was
the first considered this morning. Judge
Kittredge decided to admit it with the
explanation for the missing part by Mrs.
Crabb. Attorney Haseett then tried to
introduce Dr. Crabb's "Lyrics of the
Golden West." The poems 'To Esther"
and "Esther, the Ideal," it was said,
referred to Miss Perry. In these there
are warm protestations of love, and it
was intended to prove that the plain
tiff in reality addressed them to the
young lady. The court refused to ad
mit the book as evidence.
Miss Carrie Perry was then called to
the stand by the defense. All eyes cen
tered on her. She created a good im
pression and Dr. Crabb smiled approv
ingly. She denied that the doctor had
ever made love to her or proposed mar
riage. â  She admitted having attended a
lecture with him in San Francisco. He
had written to her that he and Mis.
Crabb were coming down and asked
her to accompany them. Dr. Crabb
came alone, however, and said his wife
was unable to accompany him, owing
to illness. Miss Perry said she had sent
her picture to Mrs. Crabb, and not to
the latter's husband, and that this was
j the one that was destroyed. The wit
ness had never received a letter from
Mrs. Crabb requesting her to cease cor
respondence with her husband. Mrs.
Goodrich, matron of the sanitarium
where the witness was employed as a
j nurse, told her Mrs. Crabb was much
disturbed because she thought the wit-
I ness was paying attention to Dr. Crabb.
' A tetter came for her in the doctor's
handwriting- and at the suggestion of
tin matron it was returned unopened.
Mrs. Mary Perry, mother of Miss Car
i rie, testified to the good character of
Mis. Osborne. The latter was janitress
\ of the Gilroy church, and several times
Dr. Crabb had been found caressing
her hand and gazing lovingly into her
eyes.
Both sidos then rested. Attorney
Burchard, for Dr. Crabb, wanted to
submit the case without argument, but
Attorney Hassett would not consent to
| this. Argument will commence on Tues
day morning.

{ insurgents set fire to them last even-

I The Filipinos also sent a large body of

CANAL PROVISION
REMAINS IN BILL
Senate Passes River and
Harbor Measure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON,' Feb. 24.â After a
session of nearly eight hours to-day the
Senate this evening at 6:30 o-clock
passed the river and harbor bill by the
decisive vote of 50 to 3. The measure
was under consideration throughout
the day and on several of the com
mittee amendments a determined fight
was made, but in every instance the
opposition availed nothing.
The sharpest contest arose over the
Nicaragua canal bill amendment. A
point of order was made against it that
it was general legislation, but the Sen
ate, to which the Vice President sub
mitted the point, overruled it. It was
then attacked as not being relevant to
a river and harbor measurt, but this,
too was overruled by the Senate.
Fettl re-w (Silver R.), Rawlins (D.)
of Utah and Teller (Silver R.) of Colo
rado vigorously attacked the bill, their
opposition being directed especially
against vhe canal amendment. The
statement was made that the measure
would never see the light of day m the
House, and that the canal would not be
built under the proposition inserted in
the afternoon Sewell of New
Jersey delivered a speech in support of
the Hull-Hawley army reorganization
bill in the course of which he declared
that the United States was now as
much at war in the Philippines as it
was with Spain when our army was be
fore Santiago. He expressed the belief
that it would require an army of 50.000
men to control the Filipinos and that
we were likely yet to have serious
trouble in Cuba.

Honors for Newell Vanderbilt.
RAN RAFAEL, Feb. 24.â At a banquet
given by the ex-members of Company D
last evening at the Fourth street bar
racks, First Sergeant Newell Vanderbllt,
thorltles, In not venturing outside the
fortress, caused an unfavorable Im
pression and much comment in Manila.
The streets were patroled, although
Tagalos were expelled days ago. The
flames extended their sinister reflec
tions over the whole capital giving the
appearance of a fiendish festival. The
inhabitants passed a ghastly night.
The Americans are universally cursed
and execrated. Â«>
"At daylight the fleet continued its
work of destruction, and marines dis
embarked on the beach a number of
quick-firing guns. The troops then re
crossed the river to protect the remain
ing houses at Binondo and Guiarpo. At
9 o'clock General Otis, from the tower
of the cathedral, viewed with a tele
scope the nre area surrounding the
town.
"There is extreme scarcity of provi
sions. The walls of the suburbs are
placarded with 'Death to Yankees.' and
'Respect foreigners.' The weather Is
very dry and the river and brooks low
er, consequently there Is a scarcity of
water, and the absence of fire-fighting
implements has Increased the helpless
ness of the situation.
"The Insurgents threaten to wreck all
of the capital, not leaving a stone or
brick within the radius of American
control. The savage grandeur and
heroism of Napoleon's expulsion from
Moscow is being repeated In the far
East. Brave races are claiming their
independence and their rights, although
maligned and misrepresented. Cuban
horrors under the Spaniards were noth
ing compared with those of the Philip
pines under the stars and stripes."
who was adjudged by ballot at Van
couver to be the most popular sergeant
in the Eighth Regiment, was presented
with a handsome gold locket studded with
diamonds. The fycket was presented In
a fitting speech by Judge Angellotti. The
committee of arrangements consisted of
Arthur Scott, V. J. Cheda and County
Treasurer Thomas Fallon.
ENEMY'S SHARPSHOOTERS
ACTIVE ABOUT CALOOCAN
MANTLA, Feb. 24, 4:44 p. m.â The en
emy's sharpshooters have been particu
larly active about Caloocan all day.
Special attention was paid to the three
gun batteries near the railroad, and the
improvement of the rebel marksman
ship was very noticeable. The rebels
| fired volleys at the battery, their bul
| lets frequently skimming the tops of
j the sandbags.
A lieutenant of the Twentieth Kansas
Volunteers and three other men were
slightly wounded. A man was killed in
the trenches, to-day.
The rebel battery has not been used
since a shell from the United States
double-tuxreted monitor Monadnock ex
ploded over it yesterday.
The enemy's nre was so hot during
the night in the vicinity of Higgins'
house that the headquarters was re
moved to a church four hundred yards
inside the line.
A few small flres have destroyed sev
eral native houses in the outskirts of
â¢the city.
The Twentieth Infantry is being dis
embarked from the transport Scandla.
i The regiment will be encamped on the
water front, at the former quarters of
the Tennessee volunteers temporarily.
Orders have been issued to enforce
the provisional customs tariff at Iloilo,
and the following officers have been ap
pointed to conduct the civil affairs of
Iloilo: Major Theodore Stomberg, treas
urer; Captain J. T. Evans, collector of

GOLFERS COMPROMISE
WITH BUTCHER KLEIN
For a Proper Consideration His Odor
Manufactory Will Be
Removed.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 24.â When the San
Rafael Golf Club attempted to force Chris
Klein, the butcher, to move his slaughter
house from the vicinity of the new golf
links on the theory that the juxtaposi
tion of an odor factory was not condu
cive to an esthetic enjoyment of the game
Caledonian, the members were not long
kept in ignorance of the fact that they
had caught a Tartar. Klein declared
that "he was there first," and prepared
to make a stand in the courts for what
he deemed his rights. Attorney Camp
bell had not counted on such determined
opposition; so the manipulators of the
brassie and the niblick withdrew their
forces and held a council of war.
Their deliberations resulted in a truce
being declared, and it was finally decldod
to see what could be done with the stub
born butcher on a monetary basis. After
a conference with the "Hoot Mons,"
Klein found enough coin was forthcom
ing to salve his" injured reelings and make
the suit accrue to his financial benefit.
Accordingly, it is stated on excellent au
thority, for a goodly consideration the
butcher will move his sausage mill and
let the Injunction issued by Judge An
gellottl continue permanently. In addi
tion to this compensation, the butcher's
attomey'e fees will be paid by the club.
As soon as the slaughter house is re
moved the club will build a summer house
on Its site and turn it into a sort of villa
similar to the various places around the
bay now so well patronized by society.

Uneasiness at the Celerity With
Which Filipinos Pierce Our
Lines.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Im
pressed with the gravity of the Philip
pine situation the President and his
Cabinet grave consideration to-day to
measures which should be taken to put
an end to the trouble aa quickly as pos
sible. It was determined to give Gen
eral Otis all the men he may need. It
was pointed out to-day by a member of
the Cabinet that Otis would not require
any great reinforcement if he succeed
ed In slaughtering the Filipinos as he
did in the engagement of yesterday.
Of 1000 Filipinos engaged, 500 were
killed and wounded and 200 taken pris
oners. This extraordinarily large num
ber is taken as an indication of the
purpose of the Insurgents to oppose the
suffered, who endured, who sought and
who found relief."
"Mrs. H. P. G. Carnes, one of the
best-known ladies In Butler, Pa., says:"
"For nearly three years I was under
the doctor's care, a constant sufferer
from female weaknesses in the most
aggravated form."
"Medicine did me no good and my
suffering was so great that at times I
felt that death would be relief."
"At last our druggist recommended
me to try a remedy about which I had
heard much, but knew little."
"I took hia advice and before I had
finished one bottle, I was astonished at
the marvelous change It made in my
health."
"I am rejoiced to say that It com
pletely cured me. I am now feeling
ALGER DETERMINED
TO STAY IN POWER
Will Not Get Out of the Cabinet
Until H e Is FÂ° rc Â«d
Out.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24. â The Herald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: Secretary Alger said to-day that "so far as hiÃ
own disposition was concerned he would remain in the Cabinet until the
end of the present administration."
No one ever doubted this. The President has hoped that he might
even unwillingly tender his resignation without a direct request for It.
Naturally the President is reluctant to resort to drastic measures, but
with the pressure being brought to bear upon him by the most promi
nent Republican leaders in both houses of Congress and members of
his Cabinet there is no doubt that ultimately the resignation will be
demanded if the Secretary does not tender it voluntarily.
Secretary Alger will be so completely ignored in all arrangements
for the reorganization of the army and in the selection of officers un
der the law that those who desire his resignation feel confident he can
not much longer withstand the freezing-out, process which has already
been instituted.
In view of such occurrences as those in the House of Representa
tives and of the popular demand in all directions for a change in the
head of the War Department, the President has quite made up his
mind Alger must speedily be unloaded from the Cabinet.
American troops to the last, probably
because of reports Aguinaldo has cir
culated among them that the Ameri
cans will torture them if they sur
render.
The only source of anxiety to the of
ficials is the apparent ease- with which
the insurgents, apparently In large
numbers, are able to penetrate the
American lines. The force of 1000 men
dispersed by the Americans yesterday
"gained access to the outskirts of the
town behind our lines," according to
General Otis. This shows to the of
ficials that the lines of the American
force are so thin that it is not difficult
for the Filipinos to get through without
detection.
FILIPINO JUNTA'S
VENOMOUS TIRADE
HONGKONG, Feb. 24.â The Filipino
Junta In Hongkong publishes a venom

following effect:
"Chaos and pandemonium reign at

of the house of a foreign Consul (the
name is not given) the American au
thorities promptly paid for the damage,
hoping to avoid publicity. The escape

The- manifesto alleges that Major
General Otis is "incapable of filling his
position," and then proceeds in a rabid
denunciation of the American soldiers-,
declaring that their conduct is bring
ing disgrace upon the white race.
The Junta says the premises of a
Hongkong merchant at Iloilo had been
looted by Americans and the merchant
has lodged heavy claims for his losses.
The tirade concludes with the state
ment:
"The reports of the hoisting of the
American flag by the natives of Negros
are practical buncombe."
Caught In San Francisco.
RIVERSIDE, Feb. 24.â Ed Franklin,
who stole $7000 from Peter Provensal a
couple of weeks ago, has been arrested
at San Francisco. A telegram from the
detectives of that city was received by
Sheriff Coburn this morning stating that
they had Franklin and that a larga
amount of the stolen money Was found
with him. Coburn left for San Franciaco
to bring him back.MRS. EMILY SPRING
SUES FOR A DIVORCE
SAN JOSE, Feb. 24.â A divorce suit
was filed in the Superior Court to-day
that will set San Jose polite society
agog and supply food for the gossipers
for many days to come. The principals
in the case are Mrs. Emily Spring and
her husband, Henry M. N. Spring,
clothier and Councilman. Mrs. Spring
is the plaintiff and she charges her hus
band with violating the seventh com
mandment. She names as co-respond
ents the two Behr sisters â Jane and
Nellie â residents of San Francisco. Feb
ruary 12 and 19 last are given as the
dates when her husband so far forgot
his marriage vows as to mingle and
associate with these young ladies.
Mrs. Spring is determined to insist
on a divorce. She has engaged Attor
ney V. A. Scheller of this city and given
him instructions to carry the case right
ahead to a final separation. The
plaintiff asks for all of the community
property, estimated at over $50,000, $400
. a month alimony and $750 counsel fees.
She demands the custody of the three
children â Jackson, aged 7; Dorothy,
aged 5, and Margaret, aged 3.
The Springs are prominent society
people of this city and have always
moved with the upper-ten. For the
past couple of years they have not got
along: very well together. Several months
ago Mrs. Spring became convinced of
her husband's infidelity and engaged a
detective to watch him, with the result,
,it is alleged, that sufficient proof was
obtained to warrant the charges set
forth in the complaint. On the first of
the year Mrs. Spring closed their pretty
. home on Seventh and S.in Antonio
streets and with her children took up
her abode at the Palace Hotel in San
Francisco. Since that time Spring has
â  b^en living at the St. James Hotel in
ihis city.
H. M. X. Spring is one of the best
known young men in this county. He
conducts one of the largest clothing
stores in this city, on Santa Clara and
Market streets. He is a member of the
City Council and is worth in the neigh
borhood of (100,000. Most of this Mrs.
Sprinp claims is community property.
Spring is an enthusiastic sport and
owns a number of fine hounds. To
these animals and to the fair sex Mrs.
Spring attributes their troubles.
Mrs. Spring has a fortune of her own.
Before her marriage she was one of the
:in<<\vn of the society belles of this
city and took a leading part in festivals
and balis for charity purposes. She is
one of San Jose's sweetest vocalists.
Mrs. Spiinp and her children are now
located at the Hotel Pleasanton in San
Francisco. The erection of a pretty
summer home will at once be com
menced at Belvedere. In August she
wiil leave on an extended European
visit, during which she will pursue her
vocal studies with the b^st masters
abroad. It is said she has ambitions
to become a great concert singer and
her numerous friends are confident she
has plenty of ability in this line.

mean by telling those who gathered
around the banquet board at Boston
that up to the ratification of the treaty
h^ had simply held the Philippines as
commander in chief without any policy
of his own, leaving the whole matter to
be determined afterward by the Con
gress? Was he foolish enough to be
lieve that his mere statement would be
allowed to pass unchallenged? Was he
vain enough to suppose that his ipse
dixit would conclude the matter, with
the damning proof of its falsity so near
at hand?
"Mr. Chairman, why did the Presi
dent change his original intention as to
the terms to be incorporated into the
"treaty? What were the influences that
brought the change about? I have
heard it stated that the applause of
the people who greeted him just about
at this juncture of public affairs while
he was on a tour in the West was the
reason fc-r it. Was it, then, the condi
tion of public sentiment rather than
the right or wrong of the matter which
Influenced the Presidents mind? Does
the chief executive regard his great
prerogatives to be so supinely repre
sentative that he must needs abdicate
them at every popular wind that blows?
Does he feel that his high office gives
him no latitude for tne exercise of in
dividual judgment and of independent
action? Did he make no allowance for
' transient ebullitions of public enthusi
asm and excitement, overlook his op
portunity to save the people from
themselves, lose sight of all the sacred
traditions of the country and fear to
make his appeal to that ultimate tri
bunal which has so often in our na
tional history vindicated those who
have fearlessly stood for the right in
public affairsâ the sober second thought
of the great American people? And is
his Excellency quite sure that he prop
erly gauged the condition of the public
mind on the subject of Philippine an
nexation? Is he absolutely certain one
swallow really makes a whole sum
mer? It would really seem so, for in
this Hoifie Market address he exultingly
declared that the annexation treaty had
passed the Senate by over two-thirds
and was sanctioned by the judgment of
nine-tenths of his countrymen. How
â¢that treaty finally got its two-thirds
majority in the Senateâ the tremendous
pressure necessary to secure it thereâ
where its fate hung doubtful and trem
bliig in the balance until the very
latest moment and was then only saved
by the votes of Senators who had most
of them spoken against it, no man
knows better than Mr. McKinley. Adu
lation has indeed sorely blinded the
chief executive to the truth if he imag
ines that even the majority of his coun
trymen approve of this permanent hold
ing in the Orient. Let him not pin his
faith too securely to the sordid inter
ests which clamor so loudly in his hear
ing. If he will but quiet the noisy
throng which surrounds him long
enough to put his ear to the ground
â¢ and listen he will distinguish the
premonitions of the coming storm; he
will hear the steady tread, not of the
100 000 men he demands for a cfusade
against liberty, but of a mighty army
â¢ of people who are beginning to move in
defense of their cherished traditions
and their violated honor. _
"We have been told, further, that the
Preside- 1 yielded up his first blush im

dilections are naturally for arms. They
have imbibed, of course, the prejudices
and the preferences of their calling. We
cannot blame them for desiring to mag
nify the size and importance of the
army and navy, for advocating expan
sion and the taking on of a colonial
policy.
'"Again, we have been assured that
the demand of our Peaeft Commission
ers at Paris to hold the Philippines is
what induced the President to yield.
So far as one of the Oommisioners is
concerned, we know that this is false.
But even if this statement were true,
th^ constitutional power to negotiate a.
treaty was his, not the Commissioners'.
They were simply his instruments, ap
pointed to carry out his will. No, Mr.
Chairman, this plea, like all the others,
will not avail. The truth is that these
Commissioners got their inspiration
and their instructions from the White
House. Those instructions once
changed, the action of the Commis
sioners would have been different. The
wrong was with the chief executive.
He and he alone is responsible.
"Mr. Chairman, in my humble opin
ion, the reason for the change in the
Presidential policy was his concession
to the selfish capitalists of the coun
try, his surrender to their demands.
These are the gentlemen who furnished
the money for his nomination and elec
tion and who, I doubt not, have
pledged him a renomination and re
election. These are the gentlemen who
are already seizing upon valuable fran
chises in China, m connection with the
English syndicate, with a member of
Parliament from Wales at its head.
These are the gentlemen whoTh Lord
Beresford has in mind in his cordial
but not wholly disinterested invitation
tn an alliance in China with Great
Britain, Germany and Japan, against
Russia and France, the old-time ene
mies of his country and the old-time
friends of ours. These are the gentle
men who are already grasping after
special privileges in the Philippines, in
Cuba and in Porto Rico. It was, I im
agine, for their special benefit that the
President created his advisory board
to the War Department, composed of
three American citizens, their object
being to farm out valuable privileges
and immunities which should belong to
the people of those islands themselves
and in whose disposition they should
have a voice, if their government is to
be free and their rights maintained. I
have no fault to find with the spirit
of legitimate American commerce. My
contention is against th? spirit of
American greed which cares nothing
for the spirit of American liberty.
"And what do these gentlemen pro
pose? To amass colossal fortunes in
the islands by virtue of their franchises
and upon the cheap labor of the native
population, not one dollar of which will
ever find its lodging place in the pock
ets of the American people. To enable
them to do this our whole population
is to purchase their field of operations
for th^m in the Philippines for the rarr
som of $20.00Qp')00 and is to be taxed in
terminably and excessively in the crea
tion and maintenance of a great army
and navy which is to conquer and hold
the Filipinos in subjection and defend
the islands after they have been ex
pensively fortified against the assaults
of the great European nations, with
which our new foreign policy will be
certain to bring us into frequent con
tention.
"What else is upon the programme of
these gentlemen? The open door in the
Philippines, making it totaJly impossi
ble for ever to discriminate in duties
in favor of the products of the Ameri
can farm and the American shop.
"What is the other sacrifice that is
required? That the annexation of
Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines,
absolutely sure to come at an early
day, for they have registered it in their
vows, shall precipitate the sugar, to
bacco, hemp and other cheap products
of these islands and Hawaii upon the
American market in free and unre
stricted competition with the agricul
tural and laboring elements of our
country.

!ed attention. Six months ago, he said,
| no one could have made him believe he
j could ever have been brought to vote
! for a $20,000,000 indemnity to Spain. Yet
| the change of conditions had rendered
it incumbent that he should vote for it,
just as it was necessary that he should
vote for the pending bill. The Govern
ment occupied a certain attitude before
the world. He would stand by it, right
or wrong. (Republican applause.) But
I his action in support of the Govern
ment did not mean that he gave his
assent to the administration's policy
of imperialism. He argued that we rec
ognized the Filipinos as belligerents
against Spain and were now morally
estopped from seeking to place them
under our dominion. We occupy the
cruel, heartless position of accepting
th<^ Islands of those natives and from
the hour of victory leaving them in the
lurch. We must either turn the Filipi
nos loose or subjugate them.
In conclusion he charged that despite
the soft evasions of the administration
it was everywhere doing all in its
power to familiarize the country with
the monstrous face of imperialism.
Landis (R.) of Indiana, replying to
Johnson, declared that the latter did
not represent the sentiments of his dis
trict; that he had been repudiated by
the people. If the .gentleman returns
to his district, he said, he will be cru
cified by public opinion and spat upon
with indignation.
Johnson said it mattered not to him
whether he were popular. He was only
concerned as to whether he was right.
He referred to Landis as the "diminu
tive Representative of the great Re
publican party of the great common
wealth of Indiana."
Rhea <D.) of Kentucky said he was
tired of the vacillating policy of the
President. In the course of his ar
raignment of the President. Rhea spoke
of Secretary Alger as a man who, "if
public history be true, had been cash
iered from the army for cowardice on
the eve of battle."
"That is not true," interposed Spauld-
I ing (R.) of Michigan.
"Oh. I do not mean cashiered in the
I literal sense. I mean that he left his
I command without orders and against
j orders and came here, where he was
j court-martialed."
"He was never court-martialed."
"Then he resigned."
"That's different," replied Spaulding,
amid great Democratic laughter and
applause.
Marsh (R.) of Illinois, a member of
the Military Committee, closed the de
bate. He evoked much applause on the
Republican side in reply to the Presi
dent's critic by referring to him as the
greatest of living Americans, and. the
first in the hearts of his countrymen.
He declared it was absolutely untrue
that any franchises had been granted
in the Philippines, Porto Rico or Cuba.
This closed the general debate. The
committee rose and at 5:32 p. m. the
House recessed until 8 o'clock.
Seventy-seven private bills were

The Regular Troops to Consist of Ten
Regiments of Cavalry, Seven of
Artillery and Twenty-Five
of Infantry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â The Sen
ate Committee on Military Affairs re
ported the compromise army reorgan
isation bill just before the adjournment
of the Senate at 6:30 p. m. The bill
had been framed at the War Depart
ment last night by the officials of that
department and a number of Senators,
and was under consideration by the
Senate Committee and its sub-commit
tee during the greater part of the day.
The formulation of the compromise
was placed in the hands of Senators
Hawley and Carter of the Military
Committee, on behalf or the Repub
licans, and Senator Cockrell in the in
terests of the Democrats. They met at
10 o'clock to-day and continued quite
constantly in session. Colonel Carter
of the army sat with them for the pur
pose of supplying technical informa
tion. The sub-committee had it in
charge until 4:30 o'clock, when the full
committee met. The committee made
a number of changes and after a sitting
of two hours reported the bill to the
Senate.
The bill as reported differs in many
details from the bill read in the House
to-day by Hull, but the general frame
work is the same. In the new bill one
section covers the entire increase of
the army, and it reads as follows:
That to meet the present exigencies of
the military service the President is here
by authorized to maintain the regular
army at a strength not exceeding 65,000
enlisted men, to be distributed among the
several branches of the service according
to the needs of each, and to raise a force
of not more than &5.000 volunteer infantry,
as he may determine, from the country at
large, under general law, or from the lo
calities where their services may be re
quired, with regard to citizenship or ed
ucational qualifications, and to form the
same into not more than thirty regiments,
organized as infantry regiments of war
strength in the regular army.
Provided, further, that each regiment
shall have one surgeon with the rank of
major- two assistant surgeons, one of
whom shall have the rank of captain.
and one that of tirst lieutenant, and three
hospital stewards. Provided, that such
increase in the regular and volunteer
forces shall continue in service <mly dur
ing the necessity therefor, and not later
than July 1, 1901.
The allotment of major and brigadier
generals is aÂ» follows:
That the President shall have power to
continue in service or to appoint by and
with the advice and consent of the Sen
ate brigadier generals of volunteers who.
including the brigadier generals of the
regular army, shall not exceed one for
every 4000 enlisted men actually in ser
vice;' and major generals of volunteers
who. including the major generals of th^
regular army, shall not exceed one for
every 12.0f>0 enlisted men.
Provided, that regular army officers
continued or appointed as general offi
cers or as field or staff officers of volun
teers, under thÂ« provisions of this act,
shall not vacate their regular army com
missions; and provided, further, that no
general officers appointed under the pro

ALGERISM AND
ITS CONSEQUENCES
President Jordan of Stanford
Strongly Criticizes the Ad
ministration.
STOCKTON. Feb. 24.â Professor David Starr Jordan in a lecture
before the students of the High School this afternoon indicated that he
was very much out of harmony with the administration and prevailing
practices in politics generally. His subject was "Higher Education,"
but he tacked over to current political affairs. He declared there was
enough latent statesmenship in this country shut out by the politicians
from participation in the affairs of the government to improve the
beneficent influences of this Government a hundredfold apd revolution
ize the decaying governmental systems of Europe. The exclusion of
statesmanship and the prevelance of personal "pulls" and "pushes"
was responsible for the embalmed beef scandal, for such incompetent
officers as Captain Alger, and for the thousands of lives sacrificed in the
late ill-managed campaigns of the army.
The Americans, he said, were competent to lead the march of civi
lization and to be in the vanguard of the movement toward more per
fect political systems. As it was now, the burdens of government were
increased twofold through incompetency, waste and dishonesty. The
office was created for the man, and not the man selected for the office
through his intellectual and moral attainments.
The professor told the students the story of how one of the late
Peace Commissioners went to a banquet in Paris with his mouth full of
tobacco. After he had expectorated over the floor a cuspidor was
brought by a waiter, who, being unfamiliar with the use of the recep
tacle, set it on the table before the embarrassed Commissioner. Would
it not be better, he asked, to send men abroad who were familiar with
the usages of good society, instead of men who would make the nation
appear to be made up of uncouth persons?

ONE-STORY BALDWIN.
BALDWIN'S announcement of intent to build
a row of one-story rookeries on the site for
merly occupied by his imposing tinder-box and
gepulcher combined is a direct affront to the people
cf this city and a threat to capital. It has almost the
savor of blackmail, for Baldwin is shrewd eqough
to realize that one phase of the indignation he will
arouse may take the form of an offer for the property.
Such a structure as Baldwin contemplates would be
worse and more unsightly than a hole in the ground.
It would deface one of the prominent corners, and
necessarily attract cheap tenants, if any at all. It
would be a blot and a blight, having the distinct
cnect of lowering property values. On that corner
should rise a stately structure, and this time not made
of lath and plaster.
Baldwin is not appreciative. San Francisco has been
too .good to him, and he would repay its kindness
with a shanty. The walls of his old hotel should have
been condemned while hot, and leveled to the ground
while warm. Instead of this course being taken, the
aged- capitalist was permitted to do as he pleased, to
t;;ke his time in clearing out rubbish, to use the streets
as depositories for blistered bedsteads and soaking
mattresses, and to abuse everybody who objected.
Now he begins to show the brand of gratitude which
stirs him.
, ' The first thing Baldwin knows he will be getting
unpopular.
A PROFESSORSHIP OF ADVERTISING.
IX a recent address at University College, Liver
. pdol, on the occasion of the formal opening
of a school of commerce in connection with the
college, the Right Hon. James Bryce, M. P., in out
lining the work which should be undertaken by the
school, suggested a systematic training in what he
cailed "the art and mystery of advertising."
' While the proposal is novel in its nature, it is well
worth serious consideration. Mr. Bryce stated that
in none of the great commercial schools of the Con
tinent, or elsewhere, i 3 any instruction given in the
. value of advertising to commercial enterprises, or the
best means of employing it, and went on to say:
"Advertising has now become so extremely important
a part of our commercial life it would be very desir
able if something could be done to reduce it to a
science, so as to enable the young merchant to know
in what way his money expended for advertising
could be used to the greatest advantage."
That such a course of instruction, based upon the
experience of successful advertisers, would be a bene
fit to young men about to embark in mercantile life
is indisputable. Millions of dollars are expended
Â«very year in advertising, and it is safe to say that
much of it is virtually wasted. Shrewd men of course
learn by experience how to advertise in a profitable
way, but a considerable number of persons go on
year after year paying for so-called advertisements
that yield them hardly any returns whatever.
In this connection it is worth noting there has been
formed in London an association calling itself the
Society for Checking the Abuse of Advertising. It
Tiis conducted a successful campaign against all de
vices which are disfiguring to streets or landscapes
or are dangerous to life and limb. A similar society
would find a good field for operation in America,
where such devices are carried to the extreme.
Whether Mr. Bryce's suggestion will be adopted
at the Liverpool School of Commerce is doubtful. It
sounds somewhat too fanciful to be accepted by con
servatives, and yet it is essentially wise. Young men
â¢.who intend to carry on a commerce in all parts of the
worJd ought certainly to be instructed in the best
means of making known to foreigners the nature,
uees and prices of the goods they handle, and to do
.that they must resort to advertising of some kind. It
. would be well, therefore, to teach them the folly of
Spending their money on various forms of so-called
*d.ve.rtising which offend the public instead of attract
ing it.
That England has on hand a little affair in Egypt
wherein the death rate is likely to make that of the
Spanish-American war seem trivial is a circumstance
w"hich the people of this country have hardly consid
ered" worth noting. This thing of spreading civiliza
.tiqn among the benighted, while it is an established
"habit, nevertheless comes high.
Several collectors have recently left the city, leav
ing no addresses, and none of the money which they
happened to have taken in. However, as they left a
large part of the latter at the racetrack and pool
rooms, they will not be able to declare dividends even
if they escape the police and their own consciences.
Since Dewey has called for the Oregon there is no
doubt he will get it. If there is anything Dewey
wants all he has to do is to say so.
LEGISLATIVE BLUNDERS.
IN the case of Howard E. Wright The Call warned
the members of the Assembly of the danger of
yielding to misplaced sympathy for an unrepen
tant corruptionist. When his bare resignation from
the Speakership was accepted as an atonement for the
receipt of pecuniary aid in a political canvass under
a distinct understanding that he would support a par
ticular candidate for the Federal Senate it became
evident that the citizens of this State would apply to
such Assemblymen as allowed themselves to be drawn
into that indefensible position the maxim of nos
citur a sociis, or. to express its accurate meaning, that
a man is estimated by his associates.
This warning may now be repeated and enforced
in relation to the Senate, to the entire Legislature
and to the Governor. Because episodes in the life
of Grove L. Johnson were recalled through the me- j
dium of cartoons in the daily press, for which, if |
libelous, a complete remedy was provided by law, it
has been plausibly asserted that the unconstitutional j
anti-cartoon bill, which had been defeated in the Sen- j
ate the day before, was passed and immediately ap- ;
proved. If this assertion had been true, then, irre
spective of the merits or the demerits of this bill, by ;
such an exhibition of rage and vindictiveness the Sen- J
ators who voted for it and the Governor who signed j
it would have injured themselves and not the press, j
It is too clear for argument that a public officer, j
either in the legislative or executive department of
the government, who, representing the people of this .
State, does any act under the influence of passion for
the purpose of revenge, or to facilitate the candidacy !
of a man unworthy of the station to which he as- j
pires, places on record the evidence of his own lack j
of balance and incompetency to reason with accuracy |
orj|o decide with justice.
But the Assembly also saw fit by resolution to ex
press its confidence in Mr. Johnson, and yesterday in
the joint convention he received fourteen compli
mentary votes. These were pieces of folly that cannot j
fail to produce unpleasant consequences. The world :
is exceedingly tolerant to- youthful follies, or even to j
conduct of a graver complexion. There is a generous
and chivalrous vein in human nature, resulting from
the universal consciousness of imperfections that
leads to the condonation and oblivion of early faults
in men, and occasionally in women, who labor and
strive for a transformed and higher life. But the con
dition is an element in the pardon, and, if violated,
the original transgression is revived. A man who,
having a turned down page in his own history, in the
course of a professional and legislative career, in
which he is aided by the silence of the press and of the
public, wantonly and vituperative'y assails every
human being who crosses his path and dogmatically
ard uninterruptedly represents every corrupt element
in politics until he becomes virtually an enemy of the
human race, cannot expect that, in his own case, the
mantle of charity will never be raised. He, above
other men, is called upon to exercise the same moder
ation and the same humanity toward others that he
solicits for himself. He occupies no attitude that
enables him to assume his own immunity as giving
him an opportunity to betray the public, to lower
and degrade the State in which he resides, and coarsely
and brutally to vent his own personal animosities
under the shield of legislative privilege, while he
seeks to deprive an observing and independent press,
without motive or object except to benefit the State
and the nation, of constitutional and legal protection.
The hysterics and melodramatic frenzy at Sacra
mento, to the extent to which they exist at all, are
deliberately worked up by Dan Burns and his asso
ciates in the hope that when all other treacheries to
the people have failed he may be forced into the Sen
ate of the United States on a wave of spurious indig
nation. No human being has pretended to assign a
reason for this unprecedented attempt to insult the
State and locally to destroy the Republican party ex
cept as a retaliation for newspaper exposure and
criticism. The comments of the interior press alone
have deprived the railroad and its satellites of excuse
or palliation -for their obstinate and dishonest ad
hesion to Burns, and the infamy of his success would
be beyond apology or explanation.
The Call has no candidate for the Senate. It
stands, first, for the country, and, second, for the Re
publican party. It asks only that the best available
Republican be chosen. This is a demand that Cali
fornia and the nation will comprehend. It cannot be
evaded by Billingsgate or by puerile exhibitions of
temper. It cannot be affected by the roar of a bully
or by the violence of a bravo. It speaks for itself, in
precise, clear and patriotic tones, harmonizing with
Republican dignity and with American honor.
SfIVE THE FORESTS.
AT the instance of the Water and Forest Society
two bills have been proposed in the Legisla
ture and should be passed. One is to create
the office of Irrigation Commissioner, to serve with
out salary and to co-operate with the United States
Geological Survey in the location of reservoir sites
tor the storage of the flood waters of the State in
such situation as to permit their best distribution to
serve the purposes of mining and agriculture. The
Geological Survey has a Federal appropriation
amounting to $10,000, which, added to a like sum ex
pended by the State, will efficiently locate a storage
system and survey its scheme of distribution, so that
when the Federal or State government, or private
enterprise, under proper legal restriction, is ready to
construct and develop any part of the system the lo
cation will be found ready and the best lines of dis
tribution laid. Surely no argument, beyond its ob
vious necessity, should be needed to secure the pas
sage of this bill. The Federal Government will not
enter upon the work without State co-operation, and
the latter must be official. The Federal appropria
tion may be spent anywhere that such official co
operation is offered, so that California must act now
to secure it. It will cost the State but a trifle; no
salaried office is connected with it and no official drain
upon the taxpayers is proposed by it. The object
lesson is before us. The valley lands are in the dusty
agony of a series of dry years, while a heavy snowfall
covers the mountains. This will melt in the summer
sun, creating floods in the streams which will flow
wastefully to the ocean. Such circumstances will oc
cur again and again, and with ample preparations for
storage and distribution all the surplus water will be
saved to irrigate the millions of acres of valley lands
which, in such years, will be fruitless without it.
The other bill proposed by the society is of no less
importance and is for the same purpose of securing,
without cost, the co-operation of the Federal Govern
THE SAN raAjNTCISeO CALL, SATURDAY FEBRUARY
ment through the forestry division of the Agricultural
Department. This bill authorizes the Governor to
appoint a Forestry Commission of five members, to
serve without salary and at no expense whatever to
the State. They are to comprehensively examine the
situation of our forests and report bills for laws to
secure the economic harvesting of timber fit for the
market, and to preserve for future use the young
crop of trees. They will report the means needed to
protect our forests from fires, which now destroy in
one year as much merchantable timber as commerce
uses in five years. At the close of its two years
term and after making its report this Forestry Com
mission shall cease and determine, so that no salaried
and costly position can germinate in it. It is be
lieved that the Governor will have no trouble in find
ing five gentlemen in the State whose interest and en
thusiasm in the subject will make them willing to un
dertake this high service.
The Legislature should be admonished to the
speedy passage of this bill by existing conditions. The
abnormally dry weather is causing the spread of fires
now in the mountains. The heavily timbered country
lying between the forks of the American River is now
on fire in a dozen places, from opposite Auburn to
far beyond Colfax and up to the snow line. There
has not been rain enough to wet the fallen leaves and
down timber, and, if heavy rainfall does not occur be
tween now and May, the present fires will follow the
retreat of the snow and cause the greatest destruction
ever known. While it is true that the proposed com
mission cannot this year meet and subdue these fires,
they furnish it an opportunity to study the conditions
suited to meet and prevent like destruction in the
future.
These two bills were introduced late in the session,
but they are of such importance that they should pass
by general consent and enable the Governor to
promptly use the authority they confer.
The forestry division of the Agricultural Depart
ment promises complete co-operation with the For
estry Commission, which assures a plan of campaign
that will finally save our mountain forests from de
struction.
A BENEFIT FOR THE INTERIOR.
WISE and timely were the words of the Record-
Union when in expressing regret that .ome of
the interior papers take a narrow view of the
proposed Pacific Exposition it said the only consider
ation of the subject worthy of intelligent concern is
this: "Is such an exposition desirable for the coast
in view of the importance it is now assuming in na
tional concern?"
That is truly the whole issue at stake, and, as the
Record-Union goes on to say: "If such an exposi
tion will substantially advance the coast interests in
the eyes of the world, and as they deserve, then it is
desirable at any cost. If it will not tend to enlarge in
telligence concerning the Pacific States, Pacific Ocean
commerce, our relations to the lands beyond the seas,
our coast production and capacity; if it will not tend
to crystallize sentiment in the nation upon the impor
tance of the Pacific Ocean commerce, then it will be
folly to promote it."
The only way to find a correct answer to the ques
tion involved in these considerations is by studying
the results of expositions in other parts of the United
States. Within the last few years a thorough test has
been made of the subject in the East. Atlanta held an
exposition which proved so profitable to the South
that Nashville followed at once with another. The
success there led to the undertaking of an even
larger exposition last year at Omaha, and now, en
couraged by the results, New York, Philadelphia,
St. Louis, Buffalo and Detroit are making prepara
tions for expositions, and New Orleans and Cincin
nati are talking of like enterprises.
Surely with such results before his eyes no intel
ligent man can doubt the benefits of expositions or
regard them as beneficial solely to the cities in which
they are held. The expositions at Atlanta and Nash
ville attracted attention to the entire South, and mil
lions of dollars of Northern capital and a considerable
number of Northern men have since gone South to
develop the mining and manufacturing interests of
those States. Similar results of good to the whole
Pacific Coast will follow a comprehensive inter
national exposition at San Francisco.
Nor can it be denied that we have reached a point
where such an exposition is needed. Our rural indus
tries have been so developed the production outruns
the demand of the market now open for them. We
need new markets, and such markets are to be found
in many parts of the world. The only way to find an
entrance to those markets, however, is by advertising
ourselves and making our resources and products
known to consumers.
Anything which will stimulate the commerce of
San Francisco will make an increased demand for the
products of the interior. Anything which will draw
the attention of the industrial and commercial cap
italists of the East and of Europe to this coast will
help every farmer, miner and orchardlst as well as
the residents of cities and towns. The benefits of
the exposition will, in fact, be felt throughout the
whole coast. From the Atlanta exposition the new
energy radiated over the wide region from the
Potomac to the Mississippi, and there is no reason
for supposing the influences of the Pacific exposition
trould be less widespread.
Ex-Governor James B. Grant of Colorado, one of
the shrewdest, richest and most popular men in that
State, once its Democratic executive, has left the
Democratic party and joined the Republican. How- I
ever, there is not enough of the Democratic party left j
there to cast a shadow. Mr. Grant evidently got tired
of flocking by himself.
A pretty young woman whose husband is now
serving a term of nineteen years for a crime in which
she was his confederate is about to be tried for the
second time in New York. The first time the jury
disagreed, and as the woman is as handsome as ever,
there is no reason for anticipating any change.
A gentleman who suffered the inconvenience of
having a handful of whiskers plucked from his chin,
and has brought suit for $250, is moderate in his de
mands. Certainly a barber would have removed them
for less, but between barbering and barbarism there
is a distinction which must be maintained.
It is a pleasant surprise for this country to learn
from Sir Charles Tupper that Great Britain won our
victory with us in the recent debate with Spain. If
Sir Charles knew this before he ought not to have
kept it a secret.
General Shafter must have brought a fairly good
constitution back from Cuba or the multiplicity of
banquets to which he is being subjected would lay
him out.
The legislative scheme to prevent lawyers from
badgering witnesses has much to commend it, but a
good club would better serve the purpose.
A vote of confidence passed by a Legislature which
seems to have so much confidence in Burns really
does not amount to much.
FUHRMAN`S DEFENSE
o FEBRUARY, 23, 1899. 0
0 To the Editor of The Call-Sir: In the interest of fair play I 0
0 would respectfully request you to permit me. through the columns of g
0 your valued journal, to acquaint the public of this city with some 0
Â» facts in relation to the collection of delinquent taxes which l the 0
0 other daily papers utterly refuse to publish. For the past fourteen 0
0 days there have appeared daily In the Examiner articles full of the Â«
0 choicest selections from the latest edition of -billingsgate diction- 0
0 ary " as revised by Andy Lawrence, charging me with all possible Â«
0 crimes, of which the mildest are "the robbing and persecution of 0
0 poor widows and innocent orphans," and threatening me with Grand C*
0 Jury investigations" and a berth in San Quentin if I should dare to Q
0 continue "my nefarious practices." And why ail this? Simply, Mr. 0
0 Editor, because I have striven to do my duty without fear or favor, 0
0 and have so far forgotten myself as to treat Mr. Andy Lawrence, the 0
0 editor-in-chief of the self-styled monarch of all the dailies, the same 0
0 as I would treat any ordinary mortal. Simply because of all the 0
0 special counsels ever employed by this city I am the first attorney 0
0 appointed who has succeeded in making Andy Lawrence, the most no- 0
0 torious tax-shirker west of New York, pay his taxes.
0 In the opinion of Mr. Lawrence this is a crime at least equal to 0
0 high treason, "which ought to be punished with instantaneous death, 0
0 without benefit of clergy. Mr. Lawrence is, of course, a very poor 0
0 man, because he is only assessed for $200 worth of furniture, which 0
0 is all the wealth he possesses, according to the assessment rolls, with 0
0 no jewelry, no watch, no money in bank, no library and not even a 0
0 musical instrument to cheer him up when he arrives at his fireside in 0
0 poverty flat, situated on Nob Hill. And while this assessment is far 0
0 ' below the average assessment of an ordinary laborer and working- 0
0 man, yet poor Mr. Lawrence has never seen fit to pay his taxes 0
0 thereon until he was compelled by suit, prosecuted by me, to pay at 0
0 least his taxes for 1896. Another suit for the 1897 taxes is still pend- 0
0 ing, and my service men have at last succeeded in serving him with 0
0 the summons and complaint to-day, after three weeks' hard work to 0
0 make rersonal service on the artful tax-dodger. When he was served 0
0 to-day he swore amid a volley of the choicest oaths that he would 0
0 again "get even with that Fuhrman, and drive him out of town." 0
0 This, in brief, is my story. The poor widows and orphans are 0
0 mainly incorporated in the holy person of Mr. Andy Lawrence, but in 0
0 addition thereto let me say that only thirty-five delinquents of 1896 owe 0
0 this city the pitiable sum of $52,757 15 in the aggregate, among which 0
0 are several banks, the Blythe estate, and other prominent and highly 0
0 respectable tax-dodgers; all of whom have been sued and every suit 0
0 will be pressed without fear or favor. No wonder the Examiner is 0
0 indignant at the "persecution of such poor people." Very respectfully 0
J3 yours, ALFRED FUHRMAN, 0
0 Special Counsel for the Collection of Delinquent Taxes of the Fiscal 0
0 Years 1896-97. ' $

THE FLOOD SUFFERERS.
Over Two Million Yellow River Chi
nese Starving to Death.
A pathetic appeal has been received by
the Chamber of Commerce on behalf of
the flood sufferers of the Shantung prov
ince of China. Those signing the appeal
are American and English people, and
their account of the prevailing distress
of the unfortunates shows that the situa
tion is serious. The writers state that
the Chinese of the district have raised
something lika $70,000 American money,
but this will go but a short way, as there
are over two millions of people starving.
The letter states:
Dally, almost hourly, we are in receipt of re
ports from our countrymen in the interior de
picting the condition of the famine refugees.
Hundreds of villages are submerged, others sur
rounded by water, houses, furniture, clothing.
In fact everything, la under water. The na
tives themselves are living In straw huts. Many
have absolutely no shelter from the winter's
cold and snow, subsisting on bark, willow
twigs, roots, etc. The summer's crops have
been a failure, the seed for next spring's sow
ing Is gone, and there is nothing for these
starving millions to hope for.

FAIR PROPERTY IS
TO BE CONSIDERED
IT WELL COME BEFORE THE
STREET COMMITTEE.
The City Urged to Assert Its Right,
and Also to Abate a Nui
sance.
One of the most Important matters that
has been called to the attention of the
Street Committee of the present Board of
Supervisors will come up for consldera-
I tion on Monday. It will be in connection
with the disputed Fair property on North
Beach.
J. T. Engle will present a communica
tion setting forth the legal status of the
property from his point of view, and urg
ing the necessity of action on the part of
the city to assert its rights to the same.
His communication In part will say:
If the Fair estate is not checked now, it will,
at an enormous expense, fill in and utterly de
stroy this safety basin and commit a monu
mental act of vandalism against the marine
and mercantile interests of the world, and
that, too, at the very time the Merchants' As-
Bociation Review is advocating the construc
tion of Just such safety slips on the entire
northern city front.
There will also be submitted the follow
ing petition, which is being numerously
signed:
The undersigned residents and registered vot- |
ers In the Forty-first Assembly District re- j
spectfully represent:
That the health of ourselves and our families
and the safety and comfort of our homes is se
riously threatened by the maintenance of an
enormous open cesspool by the Fair estate on
the northern side of Ban Francisco. A portion
of the bay has been land-locked and walled in
by a line of piles and rock and by a tilling of
sand within that line, so that the water within
that enclosure no longer ebbs and flows with
the tide, but is converted Into a pond or lake.
Into this lake empties the sewage from an area
of more than 140 blocks, and it is there pent up
to stagnate and to breed noxious exhalations
and a pestilence to poison the air which we ,
and our families must breathe.
If the public streets had been left open where '
they cross the tract that Is being reclaimed ]
and where they intersect the rim of. the pond j
referred to, or if sewers had been constructed
thÂ«rela at a!! of those points, no such unfor- !
tunate result would have ensued. If all of j
those streets or portions of streets were now to
be opened or large sewers built therein, the ex
isting nuisance would be abated.
We accordingly memorialize your honorable !
body and urge upon you the necessity of af
fording us Immediate relief from the danger |
herein referred to, either by compelling the
extension of all sewers across the Fair tract, or
by requiring: that the enclosing wall above i
mentioned be perforated where the streets In- I
tersect the same, and that sewers or other j
openings be maintained therein so as to allow !
the uninterrupted discharge of all sewage into
the waters of the bay.
NATIVE DAUGHTERS' BENEFIT.
Longfellow's "Evangeline" to Be
Bead in Connection With a
Series of Tableaux.
There have been a number of rehearsals
of "Evangeline," which is to be produced
in Native Sons' Hall this evening
for the benefit of the Native Daughters'
Home, recently established In this city,
and the number of tableaux which have
been under the direction of a committee
of La Estrella Parlor, under whose aus
pices the reading will be given, has in
creased from sixteen to twenty-one.
These, presented at the proper time,
when Longfellow's exquisite production is
being read by Psrst Grand Presidents Miss
Clara K. Wittenme?/er and Miss Mariana
Bertola and the Misses Rose Cohen and
L. O'Keefe, all noted for their elocution
ary talent, will give an added interest to
the words of the poet. In addition, there
will be several selections by a choral of
thirty voices, four vocal solos and spe
cial orchestral music.
The money realized will be devoted to
aid in the complete furnishing of the
home.
LÂ«ntâ¬n Service at St. Mary's.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the second
of the series of Lenten exercises under
the auspices of the Calvarian Society will
be held in St. Mary's Cathedral. The dis
course which will follow the "Way of the
Cross" will be delivered by the Rev. J.
E. Cottle. His subject will be "Human
Repentance." The text is from St. lake's
gospelâ "And the ' Lord, turning, looked on
Peter, and Peter remembered the word
of the Lord." The services will conclude
with the benediction and blessed sacra
ment.
Not David Donohue's Brother.
Relatives of David Donohue, who was
unfortunately shot and killed during a
duel between Martin Kelly and Billy Har
rington in the Republican county commit
tee rooms some years ago, refute the
statement that the deceased was a broth
er of James Donohue, as has been an
nounced, who petitioned Judge Mogan to
be sent to jail that he might mend his
ways. David Donohue had but one broth
er, John Donohue, so naturally James the
petitioner, could not have enjoyed that
relationship.
Mary G. O'Brien's Will.
The will of Mary G. O'Brien, filed yes
terday, bequeaths an estate valued at
$1250 to her daughter, Mary P. O'Brien,
who is named as executrix to serve with
out bonds. In her will Mrs. O'Brien says
that John O'Brien of Company I, Eighth
United States Infantry, called upon her
and said that he was her son. Mrs
O'Brien says that the soldier is an im
poster and entitled to no share of her
estate, which she provides against.

COLLISIONS
AND ACCIDENTS
ON THE FRONT
Steamers and Schoon
ers in Trouble.
THE YACHT FOLLY DAMAGED
CAPSIZED WHILE BECEIVING A
COAT OF PAINT.
Sale of Unclaimed Klondike Outfits
by the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company â Triple Launch
ing To-Day.
There was a chapter of accidents in the
bay yesterday. The steamers Apache and
Monticello were in collision, the gasoline
schooner La Chllena and the schooner Jo
seph and Henry ran into each other, the
yacht Folly was badly damaged and a
sailor from the lowa was nearly drowned.
The river steamer Apache brought from
Mare Island a quantity of supplies for
Manila. These were put aboard the Roa
noke and the Apache proceeded to her
dock at Market street wharf. The Mon
ticello was docked across the way at Mis
sion street, and a3 the Apache came up
the slip the wind and tide caught and
carried her down on the Vallejo boat.
The Montlcello was struck hard on the
port side and every pane of glass in the
steamer was broken by the crash. A few
feet of railing were carried away, but the
damage was not sufficient to prevent the
Montlcello from making her usual after
noon trip to Vallejo.
The La Chilena was on her way to Fort
Ross and the Joseph and Henry to Co
quille River. The latter was beating out
and about 2 p. m., when off the Presidio,
the two vessels came together. The cap
tain of the La Chilena thought the
schooner would cross his bows, but mis
calculated the distance and the vessels
crashed into each other. The La Chilena
lost her fore and main mastheads and
had to return to port for repairs. The
Joseph and Henry continued on her way,
so her damage could not be ascertained.
Commodore Campbell and his wife had
a thrilling experience on the yacht Folly.
It is only a short time ago that the com
modore purchased the yacht and she was
being got ready for the summer season.
Now the Folly is unusually deep and on
the dock has somewhat the appearance
of a wedge. She was got close inshore,
between two wharves, at Sausalito, and
when the tide began to fall gays were
run from the foremast to the wharves
to prevent the Folly from toppling over.
At almost dead low water Commodore
and Mrs. Campbell were standing on the
yacht's deck, directing a gang of paint
ers, when without a moment's warning
one of the guys parted and the Folly fell
with a crash on her port side. The com
modore, his wife, the painters and the
Eaint pots were all thrown into the bay.
ut luckily tbe water was only a couple
of feet deep, so they were able to wade
ashore, escaping with a ducking. A num
ber of the planks pn the port side of the
Folly are sprung and she will have to
go on the ways for an overhauling be
fore she can go into commission.
One of the sailors of the lowa fell from
the boom rigged from the side of the
battle ship and had a narrow escape. He
struck his head against the side of a boat
which was alongside, but just managed
to keep afloat until a couple of his com
rades, who jumped overboard after nim,
reached his side. He was as well as
ever half an hour after he had been taken
to the sick bay.
The schooner Fortuna arrived at Eure
ka yesterday at noon and Captain Rosich
is delighted. He left three hours after
the Occidental and beat her into port,
thus winning the bet he made with Cap
tain Brandt before leaving here live days
ago. Captain Rosich telephoned the news
of his victory to the Merchants" Ex
change yesterday.
The barkentine Wrestler and the bri?
Lurline will have a tight race to Kahului.
There is only one wharf down there, and
whichever vessel gets in iirst discharges
and loads sugar for San Francisco while
the other vessel lies in the stream and
her crew looks on. The Lurline sailed
from here last Wednesday and the Wres
tler got away yesterday morning. The
betting is all in favor of the Lurline.
There was a sale of unclaimed goods at
the yards of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company on the front yesterday. Nearly
all the stuff was made up of the outfits
and provisions of men who had started
tor the Klondike, but got cold feet and
came home when they got to Dyea or
Skaguay. Their outfits they did not con
sider worth the return freight, so they
left them on the steamship company's
hands. Peddlers were the principal pur
chasers and the goods realized small
prices.
The tugs Fearless, Wallula and Union
will be launched from the Union Iron
Works this morning. They will be placed
in the water one after the other and will
be christened by the children of the men
who assisted in building them.
Repairs are being made to the steamer
City of Peking. One new plate will have
to be put in on the port side and two oth
ers will be straightened. She will get
away on schedule time for the Orient.
The American ship M. P. Grace is mak
ing a very long passage from Sydney, N.
S. W., to this port. She is now out ninety
six days, which is something unusual for
her, as she is a fast vessel. All the ves
sels from Australia have been making
long passages, so the supposition is that
the Grace has been delayed by light winds
and calms.
The master of the schooner Reliance ran
his vessel into the hay wharf yesterday
and nearly killed one of his crew. The
vessel was making her way out of Mission
Creek with her jib and foresail set. A
sailor was on the jibboom fixing some of
the gear and the skipper was at the
wheel The latter had been bidding a
number of his friends good-by and was
feeling happy. Nearing the hay wharf,
he attempted to shear the schooner off.
but his hands got mixed and he put the
helm to port instead of to starboard. In
consequence the Reliance crashed into the
wharf and the man had to jump over
board in order to save himself from be
inE killed. After some hard work from
people on the wharf the man was rescued
and the schooner got off and proceeded
down the bay.

V'oiHd make an average day's work. After
".eliciting this information the chairman

.sicttfen clerks. Supervisor Collins thought |
Â° tilts tvas- figuring too close, as there were
' a lot .â of bills to be made out and the pub

â  .thought, twenty men more nearly the

â  Supervisor Attridge. the third member

DIRECT RAIL LINE BETWEEN
VENTURA AND SANTA MONICA
Another Important Shortening of Its Through Coast Route Contemplated by the
Southern Pacific Company.
BETWEEN the active operations I
of the Valley Road and those of {
the Southern Pacific the State of
California will probably see dur- j
ing the next year one of the |
i busiest periods of railroad construction
S in its history.
It was learned yesterday that the
| Southern Pacific Company has had un
; der consideration for some time the j
construction of a direct connecting line j
between Ventura and Santa Monica,
along the coast. Two strong induce
ments exist for the construction of this
proposed link. It will shorten the dis
tance between Ventura and Los Ange
les by ten miles and will provide a
lighter grade between these points than
now exists via Saugue. It will also tap
a new section of territory, and one that
is looked upon as being capable of con
rable development. Other import
ant results to be achieved by this pro
ject are that it will shorten the pro
posed new through coast route of the
' Southern Pacific, and enable its trams j
; to hug the shore for about fifty more '
I miles than has heretofore been possible, j
As with the fifty-five mile gap be- !
tween Surf and Elwood. this work has j
been held In abeyance owing to the ,
financial problem that its execution in
volved. But since the settlement of the j

the manufacture of brandy out of wine
and prunes without notifying the revenue
officials of his venture. Wooest had a
ten-acre vineyard and a prune orchard in
the <same county and also went into the
manufacture of prune brandy.
BOOMING THE BLUE LABEL.
Local Cigannakers Will War on Non-
Union-Made Goods.
At the meeting of the Labor Council last
night William Strauss of the New York
Cigar-makers" Union made a long speech
urging the members of the council as
union men to look for the blue label on
cigars.
"A few years ago," said Mr. Strauss,
"there were. 700 cigar-makers working in
this city and earning good wages. The
market has since been flooded with East
ern scab goods from the sweatshops of
New York and the farms of Pennsylva
nia To-day there are but 200 cigar-mak
er- in the city and n<>t half of them have
steady work. If you as union men will get
and stand together and insist on union
made goods things will be better in the
future If you 5o not there will not be
a cigar-maker working in the city within
rive years. Makf a firm fight and you will
help us and yourselves."
Several memb< rs of the local Cigar
makers' Tnion spoke on the same linos
as Mr. Strauss and a committee wasap
pointed to assist him in making his fight
against non-union eoVins.
Town Talk.
The fact that pictures do not make a
paper has been fully proved by the sue
;" Town Talk under its new regime,
being excluded from the inner
iing matter filling every
available space. "The Saunterer" gives
eight pages of bright paragraphs, club,
political and society chat. The new de-
EartnientFâ World of Law and Amateur
-have already attracted attention
promise to grow in interest. The
musical and stage news is more complete
than in f.ny other local paper, and the
miscellaneous matter is above the aver
age. Mrs. Bermingham's portrait appears

COMES IN ANSWER TO A CALL
REV. H. H. BELL Who WiÂ» Fill the Pulpit Left Vacant by the
Late Dr. M. M. Gibson.
lis the Rev. H. H. Bell the United Presbyterian Church has chosen a worthy
â UCeeMOr "to fill the pulpit made vacant by the death of its pastor. Dr. M. M.
C-i'nson. Dr. Bell arrival In this city yesterday and took up residence at 1548
Fulton street, and to-morrow he will preach his initial sermon.
Dr Bel! was' here during the month of December last year and delivered a
half dozen sermons. His efforts were appreciated by the congregation, and a
trer^ral request was made that he be called to minister to their spiritual welfare.
The~ doctor was engaged in evangelistic work In Illinois, but on being choÃen
na^tor of the local church he Immediately started for this city.
The reverend gentleman is a graduate of Monmouth College. Having com
nleted a classical course there in 1886. he entered the Alleghany University of
pVmisvlvanla and took a complete course in theology, and on finishing in 1889 he
was aÂ«=i*ned to Colorado Spring*, where he occupied the position of pastor for
five year* Since then he has been actively engaged in evangelistic work under
the direction of the United Presbyterian Synod of Illinois. His eloquence and
a-ctive campaign have earned him quite a xequtation in his calling, and this fact
led the United Presbyterian Church of this city to apply for his services, as it !s

WHOSE WAGES
ARE REDUCED
Material Saving to the
Department.
RADICAL WORK OF DIRECTORS
ABOLISH MANY VICE PRINCI
PALS IN THE SCHOOLS.
The Work of the Committee on Sal
aries and Rules Is More Far-
Reaching Than at First
Supposed.
According to Superintendent of Schools
Webster the School Department will save
$700 a month as the result of the radical
action of the Directors at their meeting
on Thursday night. The saving will be
made in the salaries of principals and
vice principals. Many of the latter have
been abolished. The. reductions were
originally mapped out by the Committee
on Salaries and Rules, and the work of
this committee was then gone over by
the entire board in executive session.
The salaries of principals were fixed
upon the number of classes over which
they have control. Where there is more
than one vice principal In a school and
the position of one has been declared
abolished, it is expected that the one
first appointed, without regard to senior
Central Pacific's debt to the Govern
ment has been effected it is probable
that both the Surf-Elwood and Ven
tura-Santa Monica gaps -will be given
early and energetic attention.
From Ventura to Los Angeles by way
of Saugus is about eighty-one miles,
with a grade of 1 per cent between Ven
tura and Saugus and a steeper grade
to and beyond the San Fernando tun
nel. Between Ventura and Los Ange
les, by way of Santa Monica, the dis
tance is only seventy-one miles, with a
grade not to exceed 1 per cent at any
point. Recently Chief Engineer Hood
of the Southern Pacific ordered a sur
vey of the coast line between Ventura
and Santa Monica direct. It is esti
mated that the cost of construction will
be high, in the neighborhood of $50,000
a mile, owing to the rough and broken
character of the shore line. The actual
distance to be built will be about forty
five miles, though the distance between
Ventura and. Santa Monica is fifty
four miles. Existing spurs and branch
lines will be used as connecting points.
The town of Santa Monica, it is cal
culated, will be greatly benefited by
being placed on the main line, and as
the Southern Pacific is a large holder
of property there this additional mo
tive exists for the contemplated new
link.
ity in the department, will be retained.
Where a vice principalship is abolished,
the incumbent merely loses the additional
salary which attaches to such a position,
but does not lose his or her place in the
department. The action of the board af
fects the following teachers:

Porous Pxasters
Why are Allcock's the best plasters?
Because they make the cures where all
others fail. Why do they make the cures ?
Because they contain the right materials.
Compare their fine aromatic odor with
the nasty smell of all other plasters.
Your sense of smell will tell you which
is the best. Did you know that Allcock's
have a greater sale than all the other kinds
put together? Did you know that all

plasters are in imitation of Allcock's?
But they imitate in appearance only.

DOUGHERTY IS
CAUGHT AFTER
A LONG CHASE
Alleged Defaulter In
Prison.
DECLARES HIS INNOCENCE
ACCUSED OF STEALING FIBE
MEN'S ASSOCIATION FUNDS.
Evaded Arrest for Many Days, but
Was Finally Found in Bed
at His Home by Two
Officers.
John Doug-herty. the alleged defaulting
treasurer of the Pacific Coast Firemen's
Association, was arrested last night by
Sergeant Donovan and Detective Cody, at
his home on Gilbert street. He offered no
resistance and was at once taken to the
City Prison, where he was formally
charged with felony embezzlement.
Dougherty is charged with appropriat
ing $17,000 of the funds of the association
while acting as its treasurer. Shortly af
ter the alleged theft was discovered the
president of the association visited police
headquarters and swore out a warrant for
the arrest of Dougherty, charging him
with felony embezzlement. Dougherty
was East at the time, but returned a few
weeks ago to learn that the police were
searching for him.
Armed with the warrant Detective Cody
visited his house, but was unable to find
the treasurer. By dint of inquiry Cody
learned that after returning- to this city,
Dougherty, fearing arrest, took refuge in
the hold of a ship, which was lying at the
foot of Third street. He remained in
hiding for four days and then struck out
for Baden. Cody located him at the lat
ter place, and started after him.
In some way Dougherty learned of the
detective's movements and went to San
Jose. Yesterday morning Cody learned
that Dougherty had gone to San Jose, and
he determined to arrest him. When the
detective reached the Garden City he was
surprised to find that the bird had flown.
Convinced that Dougherty was on his
way back to this city, Tody took the re
turn train, arriving here last night. Ac
companied by Sergeant Donovan he went
to Dougherty's house on Gilbert street.
Donovan covered the rear door so as to
prevent Dougherty from escaping, while
Cody entered the house from the front.
Dougherty was found in bed, and as the
deteciive approached him he angrily de
manded to know the object of his visit.
Cody, after reading the warrant to him.
ordered him to dress himself, which he
did He was then escorted to the City
Prison and locked up. His bonds have
been fixed at $20,000. '
Dougherty denies that he stole tne
funds of the association. He says that
before he went East he turned over his
books and. also the funds of the associa
tion to Financial Secretary Ward.
He expresses the belief that he will be
discharged at the conclusion of his exam
ination in the Police Court.
A NEW POUNDKEEPER.
J. W. Walton of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
Succeeds Osborn.
The Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals has won its long and
stubborn fight for possession of the pub
lic pound. The Health and Police Com
mittee of the Supervisors, at its meeting
yesterday, appointed James W. Walton,
a member of the society, poundkeeper, to
succeed F. A. Osborn.
This is confidently expected to put an
end to the long series of scandals which
have attached to this public institution
since its management was taken . from
the society for political purposes.' Mr.
Walton's administration of the office is
expected to prove a capable one. For
some time the work of the men employed
by the retiring official has been such as
to bring odium to the office, and the first
work of the new lfcad of the department
will be to correct all this.
The committee reported against grant
ing permission to Dr. B. C. Atterbury to
open a hospital and dispensary for Chi
nese on Washington street. It was con
sidered a nuisance and a detriment to
adjacent property.
A Good Meeting Place.

Struck by an Ambulance.
While Mrs. Mills, who lives at 311 Polk
street, and Mrs. Herring, wife of Police
Officer Herring, were crossing Market
street near the junction of McAllister
street yesterday afternoon Mrs. Mills was
struck and knocked down by one of the
city ambulances. Her companion stepped
back and was also struck down by a team
going the same way as the ambulance.
Both women were badly bruised ana cut,
Mrs. Herring being so badly injured about
the hips that she will be confined to her
bed for sevr-ral days. They were taken
into J. J. O'Brien's store and afterward
sent home in carriages. A peculiar thing
regarding the accident was thjs conduct
of the driver of the ambulance. Instead
of stopping to see how badly the women
were injured he whipped up his horses
and drove rapidly away. It is not known
which ambulance did the damage, but the
police are making a searching investiga
tion.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â Stock quotations to
day were decidedly irregular, and the move
ment was In some respects a counterpart of
yesterday. Prices opened favorably for the bulls
In a number of stocks, the industrials and the
specialties being prominent. Subsequently,
values moved alternately down and up. and
leaving net changes mixed with losses averag
ing a point in prominent railways, accompanied
by sensational advances among the specialties.
The dispatch from the American naval com
mander in the Far Bast requesting the pres
ence of a battleship for political reasons was
considered possible of an unfavorable Inter
. pretation, but the rout of a body of Filipinos
by the American army in a measure offset the
advices. London, after some firmness, was a
feller on balance. The International shares
were generally fractionally higher In the early
dealings, while the advance in Burlington, To- j
bacco and the steel stocks gave an early ap- j
pearance of strength. The smart . recoveries i
. from yesterday's close failed to hold in the |
ccse of the railways. Realizlngs In St. Paul on j
Its favorable showing for the third week in i
February left it below yesterday, and Burling
ton lost its early advance and declined further, !
ending with a loss of hi on the reported aban- |
donment of a general refunding plan. There
was considerable professional selling as well i
.as some realiztnzs and stop- orders were j
reached. Traders were induced to sell on the j
idea that there would be another substantial
decrease in the bank reserves to-morrow. The
market displayed feverlshness as the contend
ing interests succeeded in either lifting or de
pressing prices and then dealing contracted,
with a somewhat professional appearance to
the afternoon's trading. Tobacco made a max
imum rise of six points on th,e rumor that a
large operator was short and refused to cover |
and the circulation of stories as to the com- i
pany's earning power. Subsequently the price I
ran off and closed with a net gain of 1%. j
There were some very violent advances among i
â¢ the local specialties, the extreme rise in the
case of Third Avenue being 14, Consolidated
Gas 12%, Brooklyn Union Gas 8% and 2 points
' in Metropolitan. The advance in the gas stocks
was on the expectation of securing the passage
of the law allowing .the convenient manufac
ture of gas In contiguous territory which would
permit the disposal of valuable new real estate.
' The rise in Third Avenue was said to be on
the discovery of an unsuspected short interest
existing. The highly favorable condition re- i
ported in the iron and steel Industries and In- |
timations â  that the relations of the leading In- ;
terests would be closer led to an extreme ad
vance of 5% In American Steel, with which
Federal Steel sympathized to the extent of 3%.
. itÂ» extreme rise. American Tin and New York
Air Brake rose 3 points at a Jump. Sugar was
. â¢ Fomewhat weak at one time on the continuance
, of dividend rumors, and International Paper
chares receded on realizing following the decla
ration of dividends of 1% on the preferred and
I on the common. The selling of the active list
began with heavy realizing in Burlington and
Sugar.
The feature of to-day's bond trading was the
active inquiry for- San Antonio and Arkansas
Pass 43, which improved 4 points. The general I
market was very Irregular, weakness and i
strength developing in many Issues. Total i
â sales, $5,000,000.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business here was small to-day, owing to the
heavy settlement. The tone was good in the
early hours, but was depressed later by a ru
mor of the death of the Ameer of Afghanistan,
â which affected consols and Indian issues,
although it was much doubted.
Americans opened off, then rallied slightly
above parity and maintained a firm tone on
professional and Continental buying until New
York prices became weak, whereupon the mar
ket became rather wild, went flat and closed
at only fractional recovery. Three hard spots
were Central Pacific Baltimore and Ohio and
Ontario and Western. There were dealings in
Central Pacific 4s at 105%; in the 3%s at 91%; j
In Southern Pacific 4s at 89, and in Southern
Pacific shares at 35%.
Coppers were flabby. Tintos were 40; Utahs

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Feb. 24.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
I Wednesday being a holiday, not only broke
the Stock Exchange week, but established a
difference in tone between its earlier and lat
ter ' portions.
Monday and Tuesday were in the main de
voted to further exhibitions of the speculative
temper of the street and to the bullish mani
pulation which had led to renewed public in
terest. It 19 to be remembered, however, that
while the standard stocks were strong, the ac- .
tivity in them seemed to decrease and atten- I
tion was to a larere extent turned to special- !
ties and neglected parts of the share list. At
the same time the further advance in the past ',
two weeks had resulted in the usual accumu- I
lation of long stocks In weak and timid hands, j
and when the market reopened on Thursday It j
found traders were disposed to attack values, i
while the material for llqudatlon was abund- |
! ant.
I The fact that the Burlington refunding plan, |
| a belief which was adhered to by a consider- j
I able number of operators in the face of all |
I denials, proved to be. a far less comprehensive j
I plan than had been predicted, also tended to j
I unsettle the market and bring out offerings of i
! grangers and other high-priced stocks. Conse- j
I quently when the room traders raided the ;
| market on Thursday afternoon prices showed i
a readiness to yield, and the fact developed that |
I a considerable number of stop-orders were un
| earthed in Friday's market. Irregularity was
! prevalent, the standard stocks selling off,
1 while manipulative strength In the Industrials.
particularly the lower ones, was the principal
sustaining factor. There has been a large
amount of activity on the part of commission
houses, the disposition to buy stocks extending
to specialties and â  low-priced securities, with
less of a regard for Investment values and
| more inclination to follow manipulation or to
j accept rumors at their face value than the !
1 market has exhibited for some time past. There j
j was irregularity in the advances and a cor
i responding irregularity In the subsequent de- j
â  clines. At no time In the week was the move- \
I ment of prices uniform, which alone would 'â 
i tend to indicate that professional Influences i
| were more or less supreme. ._ â¢; .*'. '
London has shown an Increased tendency to j
| follow the course of our markets, and es- I
i pecially In the latter part of the week was a j
' moderate purchaser, though this was In part
! at least ascribed to orders from this side.
| The slight hardening of money < which made
i Its appearance In the last two days has not
passed unnoticed and perhaps aided ' In caus
! ing more conservative views to become preva-
J lent, while it must also.be noted that the ac
j tivity of the iron and steel markets and the
generally cheerful nature of reports regard-
Ing those industries are looked on as argu
ments of some force for the continuance of
i bullishness on the Industrials.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Feb. 24.â R. G. Dun's weekly
review of trade will say to-morrow:
The situation Is without precedent. Busi
ness has never been better on the whole, and
I in some great Industries the gain Is astonish
ing. Exports surpass last year's as much as
' imports, though the excess over Imports , then
i was heavy. Failures are smaller than last
; year and smaller than in either of six years
| past. Stocks are stronger, the average for the
j active railway securities being a- little higher
and for trusts much more, owing to â  the i ex
traordinary advance of $48 75 in Tobacco. Pay
ments through exchanges show a greater vol
ume of business than ever before at this sea
son, and nearly one-half larger than in the
best of previous years. The outgo -of bread
stuffs and cotton continues heavy. But there
are some who fear that such prosperity can
i not last.
Popular Impressions have to be reckoned with
because they control events. Yet at every
j point of danger except one the signs . are in
i every respect favorable. The upward rush â¢of
! 16.6 per cent in the prices of plgiron since
| January 1, and 17.6 per cent In prices of iron
and steel products, does indeed raise â  a ques
tion whether exports of such products may not
be temporarily checked, but if they could be
entirely stopped, as they are not, the balance
due this country would still be . large. The
crush of demand for finished products, at a
time when nearly all the works are crowded
orders covering production until July 1 or
later, causes many to refuse to contract be
yond that date except at higher : prices, and
a rise under such circumstances | may prove
the one thing needful to sober buyers and ', to
bring into : the list of producers other estab
lishments heretofore idle. While a fairly large
capacity of production is still In reserve, the
demand now pressing for cars, vessels, bridges,
buildings and pipes Is . partly to anticipate an
expected rise in price*. The best sign Is that
the â¢ great â¢ producers ; appear to be anxious to
maintain their : hold on foreign markets, al
though just now unable to take orders for
future, delivery. - -
It Is a sign of similar Import that the boot
and shoe manufacturers, .Just at this time,
seek better markets by ' a somewhat general
reduction of 2% cents In prices, although
leather averages slightly higher. The ship-
I ment* from the East have been smaller than
in four of the past six years In quantity, and
only 16,766 cases larger than in 1892, and hav
ing gained nothing during all these years In
proportion to .population, the Eastern manu-
f acturer naturally seeks that business. The
increase In prices of grain leather has not
hindered much, while a : few large sales of
hemlock sole are not necessarily at quoted
prices â¢<* A great many factories have been out
of work and sales at a reduction do not cover
all grades of goods. ;
â  Nobody can Judge ..what . the clothiers may
buy as yet, and the woolen manufacturers have
a very uncertain market ahead,, but Judge that
there will be a heavy demand for goods before
long and many of. the smaller mills are look
â  Ing for chances In the â¢ wool markets. Little
weakness Is there seen, except for fleece, and
In' quarter and -three-eighths blood 'and comb
ing wool prices are ,' generally strong, with
scarcity of supply, but sales for three, weeks
have been - 18.050,200 pounds, against 34.763,500

BRADSTREETS ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Iron and steel and cotton goods
have shared -in public Interest . this week be
cause of urgency In demand â  and consequent
buoyancy in prices. .In .' the former Industry
the striking feature has . been the continued
call for supplies alike of raw and of manufac
tured material, not only on domestic, but even
of foreign account, and it Is as yet too early
to ascertain . the effect of the numerous and
heavy advances announced during the week.
It is, of course, â  to be â¢ remembered : that iron
and steel are in active demand at advancing
prices the wOHd over, and it is encouraging to
find that export buyers of plgiron are follow
ing up their demands, notwithstanding recent
advances in this line. It is beginning ' to be
questioned, however, whether this country can
hold its export trade in some products if pres
ent Â©rice tendencies continue. A notable ex
ample of this Is furnished in steel rails, which
are now up to a parity â¢ with â  quotations in
other countries, and some business Is said to
have cone abroad because of this. Iron and
steel prices as a whole are from 15 to 20 per
cent higher than they were at this time a year
ago, and considering the cost of production and
output it is asserted that profits are but lit
tle below those of 1890.
In cotton goods, as in iron and steel, and a
number of other products, , active export de
mand seems to have been ; at the bottom of
the unquestionable improvement which has
occurred in the last I three months. The last
week has witnessed especially marked strength,
print cloths, ginghams and gray cottons all
sharing In the price advances. The : export
trade in cotton goods is the largest ever known
for the period since January 1, being more than
double the value of exports a year ago. Cotton
Itself is rather easier and slightly lower on
the week, the result partly of a slightly in
creased movement at the South. Cereal prod
ucts remain steady and .but little changed In
price, partly because of the near approach of
the crop-scare season and ajso because of lib
eral export calls. Notwithstanding heavily in
creased - receipts and continued cutting of 'â¢ re
fined sugar by the warring , refiners, . raw
sugar Is slightly ' higher, on the week, appar
ently on the growing appreciation of Improved
statistical- conditions. . : â 
Lumber is reported quiet at some markets as
1 a result of the late stormy weather, but all
markets report prices unchanged except where
quotations have been still further advanced.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3,844,359 bushels, against 2,454,
--771 bushels last week; 3,722,469 bushels in the
corresponding week of 1898, 1,372,215 bushels in
1597, 2.206.773 bushels in 1896 and 2,639,038 bush
i els in 1895. Since July 1 this season the ex
ports of wheat aggregate 162,897,349 bushels,
against 161,204,750 bushels last year.
Business failures for the â  week | number 220,
a gain of 60 over last week,' and compared

â¢ CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. : The; general' 1 surround-:
ings ,- of -.the . wheat Â« market were \ unchanged
at the commencement. Cables were lifeless, the
weather was not' a' disturbing factor and Ar
gentine shipments fto â¢â  Europe >â  for s the > week
were about anticipated. -, Under those â¢ circum
stances May wheat opened * a shade ' lower at
from 73c to 73%@73%c,' and. for an -hour or so
gave very little indication of getting far from
, those figures. The drought- was reported
broken in - California and the i bears : took an
inning on that Information. After backing
and filling between 72% c and 73% c for May until
tha last i hour of the session the market be
came weak â¢ and looked f for a while as if it
was going to break up in little pieces when ru
mors . of considerable export i business having
been done commenced to be circulated. Soon it
became known that 600,000 bushels of wheat
held; In New York by a Chicago firm had been
sold for export and that 200,000 bushels of Kan
sas wheat had been disposed of to be shipped
by way of gulf ports. New York wired also
that late London cables bid 6d more for wheat
than the price at which they accepted offer
ings f yesterday. That changed the whole com
plexion of the market, and from being list
less and inclined to go lower it became very
strong and quite active. May â¢ mounted in a
few minutes from 72% cto 73% c. and before the
end it brought 73% c, with the latest trading at
73%@73%c. .
Lack of outside -' speculation, free country
offerings and liberal receipts depressed corn
I early. The sudden ' upward whirl in wheat,
I however, â  caused a sharp rally in corn, and
1 May closed with a gain of %c.
Oats were Influenced almost entirely by wheat
and corn. May rose %c.
There was a fair provision . trade, with pork,
rather easy on commission house selling. Pork
closed 5c lower, lard unchanged, and ribs a
shade higher.

PORTLAND.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 24.â The foreign
cables, both public and private brought very
little encouragement to-day, but buyers who
apparently had . to have wheat bid up 'to 60c
for Walla Walla, and some extra heavy wheat
for milling purposes sold 'at 61c. - Even these
prices failed to dislodge enough wheat to set
prices . back to an export basis. Valley has
no percentage over Walla Walla at the present
time, and 60c ' was the best quotation obtain
able, with blue -stem nominally 61c and 62c.
Foreign wheat shipments from Portland for

THE SOTCK MARKET.
It was an average day In local securities.
The leading variation was an advance In Ha
waiian Commercial.
The mining stock market is purely a pumping
proposition at present. If the water is being
lowered prices go up, and if there is any halt
in the operations they immediately go down.
The depression of the past two or three days
has been due to the temporary cessation of
pumping In order to make some alterations.
The capacity of the pump with 100 miners'
inches of water for the first lift is 12,700 gallons
per minute; with 150 miners' inches of water it
is 19,000 gallons, and with 200 miners' Inches It
is 25,440 gallons per minute, but owing to the
limited capacity of the drain boxes in the Su
tro tunnel only 5600 gallons per minute will be
pumped for the present. Yesterday's telegram
read: "Stopped pumps several times during the
past twenty-four hours for the purpose of test
ing. The water rose four feet, but was quickly
lowered, and now stands 53 feet and 6 inches
below the 1750-foot level.
The market was weak In the morning, but
made a general recovery in the afternoon.
The Orleans Mining Company of Nevada ,
County has levied an assessment of 7 cents per
share, delinquent . March 14.
The Granite Hill . Mining and Development
Company of Nevada County has levied an as
sessment of 2 cents per share, delinquent
March 15.
â¢The official report from the Standard Consol
idated mine of Bodie under date of â . February
18 says that raise^No. 1 on the 160 level- has
ten Inches of fair-grade ore In the top, and has
been stopped temporarily. â¢ They are still rais
ing from the 316 level to connect with the 150
level, and the raise has 36 inches of ore in the â 
top. The south drift on the 31S level has three
feet of poor ore in the face. | The east crosscut
In the Black ledge on the same level has passed
through a low-grade vein ten inches wide.
Stope No. 5 on â  the ; 150-foot level In the Moyle
vein shows 14 Inches of good ore. Good ore is
also being stoped from the Fortuna vein on the
582-foot level and from other points In the mine.
During the week the new mill ran smoothly
.and crushed a total of 351 tons of ore; average |
assay vanner tailings, $10 11; concentrates pro
duced one and a half tons; no assoy value
stated; plate amalgam produced, 1895 ounces;
value per ounce not stated. '

IN SEASON
AT OAKLAND
Tony Liealzi First at
100 to 1.
CON DALTON A SURPRISE
LED GOAL RUNNER OUT IN A
DRIVE.
But Two Favorites Finished in Front.
The fascinating Widow Jones
a Winner â Glen Anne
Finally Scored.
Opportunities to win a fortune were
more plentiful at Oakland track yester
day than in the frozen Klondike country.
The long shots had an outing. Not that
a favorite did not score, for both Sat
suma and Wyoming headed their fields
out at scant odds. It was Con Dalton.
the black gelding from Dr. Rowell's sta
ble, and Tony Liealzi that afforded the
golden chance. Con Dalton took the third
â¢ vent .at odds of 30 and 40 to 1, and Li
calzi scampered In winner of the final
event with some of the books laying 100
te 1 about him. Throughout the after
noon the betting was crotchety and' the
winners hard to guess.
A big bunch of platers started in the
opening five-furlong scramble, with Jer
ilderio ruling favorite. W. H. Martin
took her back before a furlong had been
'covered and she finished in the bunch.
The heavily played Widow Jones led all
t.he way, winning easily from Ballister,
a. 10 to 1 shot. QradaSi a 100 to 1 out
sider, ran into show.
Devin had the mount on Glen Anne, and
ttie mare was installed a mild choice for
th> mile scliing run that followed. ShÂ«
â¢was in front from the Jump and in a drive
dawned Henry C a bead. The poorly
â¢ridden Joe Mussle succeeded In finishing
third.
Tom Ryan's sprinter. Goal Runner, was
sent to the- post a 2 to 5 chance for the
third number, a six-fuViong spin, and"fin
ished second. Eddie Jones took Con .Dal
ton to the front, and outlasting the fa
vorite earned the decision by a couple
of lengths. Yaruba led Sir Urian out a
head for third place.
Espionage was scratched from the
seven-furlong run. and Satsuma had a de
cidedly strong call in the betting. A quiet
play on San Mateo cut his price from
5 to 1 to 13 to 5, and the brown horse
nearly scored. Satsuma did not catch
him- until the paddock was_ reached, and
was ridden along some to win by half a
length in l:2^ ; o. Eddie Jones was third.
Thf Sly people were not pronounced In
their views, and Wyoming carried the big
coin. Bullman rode the latter, and pass
ing Zamar in the stretch beat Honig's
sprinter a neck, driving hard. Ihe
wretchedly ridden Sly ended up third.
A cheap, trashy assortment of platers
furnished the sport in the closing five
furlong dash. Al was favorite, with H.
Martin up, and after showing the way to
the stretch blew up. Tony Liealzi, with
Ellis In the saddle, then disposed of Feb.
ruary by a length.
Track Notes.
â  -Bookmaker John CVNeil will quit booking at
â  the end of the present week. With his family
he will start on a pleasure trip to Southern
California. i
. . .Grncias, which ran third In the opening
race, was played from 100 down to SO to 1.

for the benefit of Ivy Powell. The young man |
gets cold feet whenever he rides a short priced
horseâone something like Roadrunner.

Scratchedâ Schnltz 106.
Sloan was suspended pending an investi- j
gation into the race. Judge Murphy said j
last night that he was in receipt of in- i
formation that would lead him to believe |
that Tammany Hall was backed by par- j
ties In the New York poolrooms. The â 
steward's believe Sloan guilty of fraud,
and wfll recommend the license commit
tee of the Western Turf Congress to re
fuse the rider a license. Ââ.-,
A friend of Foster's said after the race
that "Fred thought Abuse a 'cinch, and
that if his horse was beaten the one tnat |
did the trick would have to run the six ;
furlongs better than 1:13. He was
beaten in 1:13%. of the race Billy Ran-
On the morning of the race Billy Ran
dall, the trainer of .Tammany Hall, en
deavored to persuade Foster to scratch
Abuse, telling him that Tammany Hall
had the others safe, and that more mon
ey could be made by playing the Montana
sprinter. Foster, however, would not ac
quiesce. Abuse started again on Thurs
day and finished second to Miss Rowena,
Some very uncomplimentary remarks
were passed around about this latter
ra The stewards also took further action.
For his very peculiar looking ride yester
day on Jerilderio and Sly, Jockey W. H.
Martin was indefinitely suspended. Mar
tin gave promise of becoming quite a
shining light among saddle artists and If
he has fallen into bad company it is to
be regretted. He came to the coast this
winter with Charley Fink owner of Hard-
Iv Florence Fink and others.
In futurV the entry of the horse George
H. Ketchum will be refused at Oakland.
The previous rulings in the cases of Les
terÃeiff and Henry Shields were reaf
firmed! Reiff was indefinitely suspended
and Shields was restricted to riding lor
t^n-n^ le ca S f cs Ga 1 f en al?"r c n robatlc- horses
placed on the proscribed list in the past
the rulings were also reaffirmed.
The following resolution was then
adopted by the board: The present stew
ards of this club believe the parties con
nected with the Little Pete scandal at
Bay District track should remain ruled \
off for life and during their tenure of
office will consider no further applica
tions for reinstatement.

It was brought to the attention of the
Health and Police Committee of the Su
pervisors yesterday that Kid McCoy was
to box In Mechanics' Pavilion to-night In
connection with the bicycle racing with
out the customary permit having been
secured from the committee. Chief Lees
was Instructed to stop the boxing if the
customary license of $100 was not forth
coming. A deputy from the License Col
lector's office visited the Pavilion dm ing
the afternoon to collect the fee. This was
refused, and he was told the exhibition
would go on despite his efforts. Finally
when the management saw the law was
against them, they said they did not care
if it was stopped so long as they could get
the people there. Unless the license Is
procured the police will not permit Mc-
Coy to pull on a glove.
Jimmy Michael left for the East yester
day morning. Michael is anxious to come
back here next fall.
The Pavilion cycle track Is to be moved
directly after the close of the present
meet to the Olympic Club grounds

Muller and Tracey to
Meet Tuesday.
AUSTRALIAN IS THE FAVORITE
ERNE AND HAWKINS BOOKED
FOR MARCH 3.
Smith and Lavigne, Two of the Great
est Fighters of the Day, Will
Do Battle Before the Ex
celsior Club.
There will be sport for all lovers of the |
game of hit and miss during the month
of March. The National and Excelsior
Athletic Clubs have announced certain
pugilistic events, which for excellence
cannot be duplicated.
The National Club will give the first
show on Tuesday evening, the 20th lnst.
The programme is a good one, as among
the contestants there ate champions in
their respective classes.
Tom Tracey, who will meet Fred Mul
ler In a twenty-round bout, has satisfied
the lovers of the game here that he is a
clever and a game fighter, notwithstand
ing that he has a slight predilection for
skitting around a ring whenever hard ;
pressed by a sturdy opponent. It must be j
remembered, however, that Corbett whip- \
ped Sullivan by his clever footwork and j
quickness in avoiding the onslaughts of j
the big fellow. Doubtless if Sullivan had I
Corbett In a twelve-foot ring James j
would not be posing as the ex-cliampion j
heavy weight pugilist of the world to-day, j
The Marquis of Queensberry, when he |
framed the rules which are looked upon as ;
nearly perfect by the fighting men of the
present time, considered that atwenty-f our I
foot ring was the proper size for scientific ,
boxers. For those who rely upon their I
brute strength and ability to stand pun
ishment, doubtless a ten-foot ring would
be better appreciated, as they could cor
ner a clever boxer and thereby stand a
far better chance of scoring a knockout.
The Tracey and Muller light should be
well worth seeing. The preliminaries are
also good. "Cocker" Tweedie and Jimmy
Reiiley are game lads, who should give
the .sports "a run for their money, and
Willie Cole and Eddie Alford, who are ,
also booked for a ten-round argument,
will doubtless aÃsist materially to make
the show an interesting affair. Tim
Hurst has been selected by the National ,
Club to referee all matches. The game
Will commence promptly at 8 o clock
The r.ext event that will be pulled
oft" by the National Club is the >-"ie-
Hawkins twenty-round contest, wh^h
will take place on Friday evening. March
3 The preliminary to this bout will be a
ten-round contest between "Gene Mulli
gan alias Sunset, and Charley Johnson.
The Eastern sports are very sweet on
Erne, but it can be safely said that Haw- â 
kins will not lack for financial support.
With the decision in the Hawkins-Erne |
fight will go the right of the winner to :
challenge Lavigne for the lightweight
championship of the world. Hawkins is
at present training at the Seal Rock
House, where he haÃ established training
quarters. Erne does most of his work at ]
the Olympic Club. John W. Considine, i
manager for Hawkins, and Kennedy, j
manager for Eine, held a conference yes
terday and decided upon the right of the ,
winner to challenge Lavigne.
Of the manr battles scheduled to take .
place during the month of March, prob
ably the groatest interest will be mani
fested In the twenty-round bout between i
the hurricane fighters, George Lavigne, |
the "Saginaw Kid," and "Mysterious"
Billy Smith. Smith and Lavigne are un
disputedly two of the greatest fighters of
modern times. They are not only clever
and up to every little trick in the game
but they are also aggressive and take a
delight Jn giving and taking punishment.
The champions will meet in Wood
ward's Pavilion on the evening of March
10, and the battle will decide the cham- \
pionship of the class they represent. It j
will be held under the auspices of the Ex- :
celsior Athletic CJub. Smith has been j
training hard in Alameda since his arri- ;
val, and Lavigne is getting Into splendid j
shape at his favorite station, Blanken's i
Six-mile House.
This is what a writer for a New York j
paper says of the proposed Fitzslmmons ;
and Jeffries fight:
If the Westchester Athletic Club Is successful i
in securing the Fltzslmmons-Jeffriea match it is i
more than likely that the bnut will be brought I
oft In the daytime. The officials of the club, i
it is Bald, are anxious to have the mill decided
by daylight because they believe it would then
attract a larger crowd.
Such an arrangement would also afford the J
club an opportunity to take pictures of the con
test, which woulfl mean a financial Item of no
small Importance to the organization. A club
capable of pulling oft such an Important fight
before the kinctoscope could well afford to offer
a handsome puree, as the revenue derived from
the pictures oftentimes far surpasses the gate |
receipts.
The Sheriff of Westchester County, who is in
favor of all athletic everclses, It is said, also '
favors the contest taking place In the daytime. \
A sporting man who is a personal friend of the
Â£hÂ»rlff of Westfhester County and connected '
with the club said yesterday that it was pretty j
sure the fight, If it went tn the Westchester I
Club would come off before nlghtrall. He paid i
that the authorities were also In favor of hay- |
Ing such a big event decided in the afternoon i
or morning because better police arrangements !
could be made, and It would eliminate the
swearing In of a score of deputies which would
be necessary under other conditions.
The articles of agreement signed by Flts
slmmons and Jeffries have no mention of the
time of day the contest If to take place, but
it Is a certainty that If the picture machine
gets in Its fine work the principals will have a
fay in the matter. They appreciate what a
good thing the pictures are and will no doubt
demand a percentage of the profits.

AN ISSUE IN
LOCAL POLITICS
The Tribune Causes a
Sensation.
BOUQUETS FOR BOTH SIDES
REPUBLICANS ARRANGE TO
~~ STORM ~ NORTH OAKLAND.
Candidates Before the Peralta, Im

Begin.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
; . . 90S .Broadway, Feb. 24.
The anti-press fever at Sacramento has
reached Oakland .and is cutting a promi
nent figure in the local campaign. Near
ly everybody who has yet made a speech
on the issues of the municipal fight has
had something- to say one way or the oth
er about the newspapers.
W. W. Foote and John I*. Davle last
night devoted a large portion of their time
at the Tabernacle to remarks about the
local and San Francisco papers and re
ferred to the fact that the leading Demo
' cratic organ in the State did not even,
mention that the Oakland Democracy was
to open its campaign. _
. To-night the Oakland Tribune, a Re
publican newspaper, created quite a sen
eation among politicians by publishing the
â¢following editorial introduction to itts re
.-port of the Democratic meeting:
On all lines of decency the Tribune Is a
Blanch Republican newspaper. -
In the municipal campaign now on It IB
anxious to transmit Its allegiance to the ticket
nominated by that party. - 'â¢
â  The ticket is sufficiently rood and the party
majority here Is sufficiently large to Insure
a substantial victory next month.
1 False issues based upon personal feelings
should find no place In the Issues of the cam
paign, and yet this is being done by a.con
temporary. _
The Democratic party has no newspaper ad
vocate here. It held a convention in the reg-u-
Jar wav composed of the best material within
Its ranks. It nominated John L. Davle for
Mayor K. M. Clement for City Engineer.
Thomas F. Garrity for City Attorney, Edward
HackÂ»u for Auditor and other equally rep
utable gentlemen for other positions.
These gentlemen are all Independent, honest
men. "" We do not believe that any of them
will 'be '-bossed," nor do we believe that there
are any men or eet of men who are trying to
WWle^ajTwe have said, the Tribune's alle
giance belongs to the gentlemen on the Re
publican ticket, we violate no rule of party
j.ropriety In saying that the city will be safe In
the hands of either set of candidates.
The Tribune, being a newspaper, sues a run
end fair report of the Democratic meeting last
evening which was large and enthusiastic.
The denials of the candidates of the charges
made against them, which the Tribune knpws
to be false, were enthusiastically received
It should suggest something to the friends of
th : n l , t '. ! rihÂ°a a t n plrsoSl vilification, willful
falsehood and false Issues should have no place
h eyTr l Xund to react In favor of the po
litlcal enemy. *
The Second Ward Republican Club has
' gent out notices for a rally at Milton Hall
next Tuesday evening. The president of
tl^ b h n^y 3 -of the Republican
candidates, headed by Auditor Snow and
City attorney Dow. addressed the Peral
â¢^T^urtWarWndependent Improve
ment Club held a meeting this evening
in Montana Hall at Adelaide station
Next Tuesday the club has invited thÂ©
Democratic candidates to appear beforeit.
The Independents will also hold a meet-
Jng at Milton Hall in North Oakland next
Monday evening. _
MANY CANDIDATES OUT
FOR THE NOMINATIONS
REPUBLICAN CITY CONVENTION
MEETS TO-NIGHT.
Delegates Are Named and the Pro
ceedings Promise to Be Lively
and Interesting.
BERKELEY, Fpb. 24.â The Republican
city convention will be held in Shattuck
tHall to-morrow night. Final arrange
ments for the gathering were completed
at a special caucus of the City Central
Committee last night. Representation
.â¢will be limited -to twenty-one delegates
from each ward.
The exposure made in this morning's
Cell of a scheme on the part of certain
candidates for School Director to intro
duce a provision into the party platform
calling for the abolition of the office of
City Superintendent of Schools was the
chief topic of discussion to-day. While
there is an unusually keen competition
among the different candidates to secure
nominations, it is evident that the ques
tion of School Superintendent is to be the
vital one of the whole campaign, and
ehould such a provision be embodied in
the convention platform a split must in
evitably follow.
The Good Government Club has been
active In its opposition to the measure.
It is more than certain that the Independ
ent Taxpayers and the Non-Partisans will
seize upon this as a handle with which to
turn the right in their favor.
The number of candidates seeking nomi
nation is larger than ever before, and the
proceedings promise to be exceedingly in
teresting.
OAKLAND WATER RATES.
May Be- Fixed by Resolution Next
Monday Night.
OAKLAND, Feb. 24.â The Water Com
mittee of the City Council met to-night
and decided to hand in a resolution or
ordinance next Monday night, fixing the
â¢water rates for the next fiscal year. Mr.
Dingee has not appeared at any of the
sessions, and this evening he was repre
sented by Attorney Nusbaumer, who
stated that Mr. Dingee's sworn state
ment is on file and that, being out of
the water business, he does not see any
necessity for answering the summons of
the Council. This concluded the investi
gation and tho committee decided that,
having all the information it wanted, it
could prepare an ordinance or a resolution
and present it to the Council next Monday
night.
All depends on the will of the Council
â¢whether the rates are fixed by ordinance
or resolution. Should the committee pre
"pare a resolution, and should the Solid
Six remain intact, the whole business
could be transacted in a few minutes and
before any protest could be made. The
only member of the six, who is up 1 for
re-election, is Woodward, and there are
some who believe that he may change his
vote In an attempt to save his political
life. If an ordinance be presented, it will
go to print for ten days and there will be
ample time for the public to exploit it.
Auditor Snow appeared before the Fi
nance Committee and said that at" the
rate the Council is spending money, there
will be a deficit of $82,000 at the end of this
fiscal year. Heitmann said that the com
ing city election will cost twice as much
as any other city election and that, If carÂ©
v.-ere observed, the High School Board
could receive the $4000 necessary to pre
vent it from closing. The Council prom
ised to do all In its power to prevent clos
ing the High School.

Sensation in the Trial
of J. W. Lynn.
ASSAULTED WIFE TESTIFIES
SAYS SHE DID NOT KNOW SHE
SIGNED COMPLAINT.
Mrs. Lynn Believes Her Husband
Was Insane When He Cruelly
Fired Five Bullets
Into Her.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Feb. 24.
<?> "I certainly believe my husband <SÂ»
<$> was Insane when he shot me five <i>
<3> times last February, and when I <$â¢
<$> signed the complaint charging 1 at- <S>
<8> tempted murder I did not know <i>
<s> what I was signing. I have no de- <Â§
<$> sire to prosecute him for the shoot- <S>
<$> Ing-, for I need his helping hand, â¢$>
<S> since I have no means of support 4>
<$> for myself and 9-year-old daugh- <3>
<S> ter."
The foregoing sensational statement
was uttered on thÂ© witness stand by Mrs.
Martha Lynn on cross-examination at the
trial of her husband, John W. Lynn, this
afternoon, before a Jury In Judge Ogden's
court.
Mrs. Lyim had first recited the circum
stances of the shooting. On the morning
of February 1 of last year, alter husband
and wife had lived apart for several
years, Mr. Lynn called on his wife at her
home in this city. He asked her to come
and live with him again, but she refused.
"Then he told me to look at the man
crawling over the roof of the porch." said
witness. "I looked through the window,
and as I turned he shot me, rive bullets
taking effect."
Witness said she had been acquainted
with the accused for two years prior to
their marriage in New York, nearly thir-i
teen years ago; that she also knew his
mother, who was a patient in the Utlca
Insane Asylum, at a time when Lynn was
an attendant at the hospital; that Lynn
subsequently worked as a fireman in an
electric light works and was injured on
the head.
The accused man sat by his attorneys,
Hugh Aldrich and J. E. McElrath, close
ly following his wife's words, and fre
quently tears filled his eyes and rolled
down his cheeks.
When asked by Attorney Aldrich
whether she considered her husband sane
at the time of the shooting. Deputy Dis
trict Attorneys Harris and Samuels vigor
ously objected, and in order to adduce an
answer the defense then made Mrs. Lynn
their witness, which action the court
ruled permissible.
Mrs. Lynn explained that the Tuesday
prior to "the attempted murder her hus
band had met her in company with an
other man on Market street, San Fran
cisco. He said to her escort: "Do yoii
know that this is my wife?" and ordered
her to go home with him. On one occa
sion when Lynn was 111 he refused to take
medicine offered by witness because he
imagined she wanted to poison him.
When witness said it was her firm be
lief that Lynn was insane ever since he
attempted to murder her, she was asked
why she had signed the complaint.
"When I signed the first complaint re
plied Mrs. Lynn, "I had not read it and
did not know what I was signing. The
second complaint I was simply told to
sign and thought I had to sign it to c
no desire to prosecute him for the shoot
ine for I -ertainly need his helping hand,
as I nava no mplns of support .for my
self and my 9-year-old daughter. .
MaTy witnesses are to be examined,
and the witness fees already amount to
Lynn was insane.
SAYS SHE COULD NOT
HAVE HANGED HERSELF
DR. ROWELL TESTIFIES AT THE
TRIAL OF J. W. BRANDES.
Another Autopsy Physician Who
Says That Poor Little Lillian
Was Murdered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 24.
Dr Hubert Rowell of Berkeley Is quite
as much convinced that Lillian Brandes
was brutally murdered by her father as
is Dr Buteau. and he so testified on cross
examination to-day. The entire day was
occupied in pathological and hypothetical
questions asked by Attorney Bennett
Among other puzzling and protracted
questions asked was this:
"Doctor, if this girl had received on
Tuesday evening such a blow on the head
as you assume she did at some time re
ceive; from the condition of the body that
you saw. assuming that the girl hung
herself on the following Saturday morn
ing at 6 o'clock with a soft ligature to a
bedpost and thereof died, would not the
symptoms of hanging in that case have
was quite equal to the occasion
and renlied- "I don't see that it would
alter the case at all. Death by hanging
is death by hanging wherever you hnd it.
And we would expect to find some of the
symptoms of death by hanging, no mat
ter how badly the girl had been hurt pri-
m Dr. i Ãowiell also explained that, strange
as It might seem, cases of meningitis and
shock have been known where the pa
tients have gone about several days and
were suddenly taken with chills and died.
"Meningitis is progressive," said Dr.
Rowoll. "The membranes become more
and more involved until the patient is no
longer able to stand up."
In answer to a question put by Juror E.
A. Randlett, Dr. Rowell testified that Lil
lian Brandes' physical condition was such
that she could not have hanged herself.
Dr. F. H. Payne, also of Berkeley, who
had witnessed the autopsy, was next
called, and on direct examination testified
along the same lines as his predecessors;
but to the surprise of all the defense ex
cused witness without any cross-examin
ation.
The trial will be resumed next Tuesday
morning.

SHAFTER TELLS
OF THE FALL
OF SANTIAGO
The General Lectures
in Oakland.
BEEF WAS NOT EMBALMED
DEFENDS THE REPORT OF THE
WAR COMMISSION.
Provisions Were Neither Scant Nor
Spoiledâ Heroic Work of the
Surgeons of the Ameri
can Army.
OAKLAND, Feb. 24.â General Shatter
delivered a most Interesting historical
lecture to-night, before an enthusiastic
audience at the First Unitarian Church,
on "The Campaign in Cuba." His address
was entirely free from any and all ai
tehipts at flowery speech making or
vainglory effusion, and was in the lan
guage of a soldier, who had seen battle
and felt proud because It had proved a
victory for the country under whose flag
he fought* as a general.
The speaker recited at length the move
ment of the American army from the
time It left the United States for Cuba,
touching briefly upon the battles of El
Caney, San Juan and tne capture of San
tiago, until it returned to the camp at
Point Montauk.
"The simplicity of the campaign," said
General Shafter, "Is what made It seem so
easy. It was simply a matter of getting:
ashore and fighting.
The speaker paid a glowing tribute to
General Joe Wheeler, referring to him as
an ex-Confederate general, "but withal
one of my most faithful and efficient gen
erals, a most loyal and excellent man."
"You have heard something of the In
humanity of the army doctors. I tell" you
there is not a word of truth in it. They
were brave fellows, too. Out of 1400 men
who were shot only thirteen died of
wounds. Never before In the history of
warfare has there been so slight a loss
of life. There was but one capital opera
tion. It seemed as though, as long as a
man was not shot through the head or
heart, he recovered."
General Shafter also denied the- criti
cism -of short rations. "Rations were not
so short," continued the speaker, "unless
some one was too lazy to go after them.
Men had hard bread, meat, sugar and cof
fee, and at no time except the first night
were rations short.
"You have heard of the poor provisions.
There are several frontiersmen present
here to-night and you know what it la to
open canned meat In the sun when It Is
120 in the shade. That It was unfit for
food Is not so."
In conclusion the speaker appreciated
the War Commissions report which viewed
with satisfaction the fact that the result
of the campaign was the realization ot
the objects contemplated, and all with ao
little loss. .
"I think we should be hapy in the suc
cess of this war; that we should pat each
other on the back instead of calling each
other hard names. The victory Is too glo
rious to mar it by any little petty differ
ences that might have cropped out In the
campaign. Â . .
"The question now resolves itself, what
to do with that which we captured, but
this does not affect me as a soldier; but
as an American citizen I should not like
to see a foot of ground captured by the
blood of our men ever given up.
A SUICIDE'S COMPLAINT.
Tailor Broman Accused His Wife of
Hounding Him to Death.
On the person of Frank Augustus Bro
man. who killed himself in Union Park
yesterday morning by shooting himself in
the head with a pistol, was found a letter
written at his request by a friend, the ,
agent for a Scandinavian newspaper
published in Minneapolis. The letter stat
ed that in 1882 Broman's wife, by threats
of having him arrested, forced him to
marry her. He alleged that she was an
unfaithful wife to him and that by her ,
abuse she made life miserable for him.
He finally left her and opened a tailor
shop at 713% Bush street and had not seen
nor heard of her for some time previous
to his death. .
On the Bth of the present month Judge
Bahrs issued an order that Broman pay
his wife $3 per week for her maintenance.
Mrs. Broman called at the Coroner's >of
fice yesterday afternoon and denied all
the allegations made against her by her
husband. She said that she had been a
goo 4 and true wife to him, but that he
was a drunkard and had abused and neg
lected her and their children.

GREAT COURSING EVENT
AT INGLESIDE PARK
PROBABLE WINNERS OF THE
FIRST RUN DOWN.
Champion Dogs From Eastern States
to Run Against Bread-Win
ners of California.
The directors of the Ingleslde Coursing
Club have concluded at last to make
much needed improvements In the park
where thousands of dollars have been
won and lost.
Good Judging, faultless slipping and ex- i
cellent hares, are the three things which
have made Ingleslde Park the favorite
place of amusement of the thousands of
pleasure seekers who have a predilection
for coursing. Weekly the crowds grow
larger, and consequently space is at a
premium on Sunday afternoons, when the
game is in full blast. It is with the ob
ject of giving- the patrons of . coursing
something better than "elbow room" that ;
the park officials contemplate extensive
improvements. They are very well pleas
ed that there is another park in existence
within easy distance of the city, as under
the present conditions they could not at
tempt to accommodate the many people
who have become educated to the grant
old game.
It will be no easy matter to handle
the immense gathering of sport lovers
who will witness the great one-hundrtM
dog stake match, which will be lnaugu
rated to-day and finished on Sunday.
Count yon Halpln says that there Is no
such word as fail and that the great
meeting will be recorded in the coursing
history of the State as being the mos
successful and interesting affair of it
kind that has been attempted since in
closed coursing was introduced. The
count's opinion cannot be gainsaid.
John Churlton, secretary of the Ameri
can Coursing Board, will run for the first
time his grand bitch Dolly Varden, and
some anxiety will prevail among the bet
ting fraternity, as she is drawn in the
stake to meet H. Lynch*! very fast younif
bitrh Lottie M. Another new one to ap- j
ficar on this occasion will be E. M. Kel
ogg's lowa Boy. Coursing 1 men can n-st
nssured that this aspirant for honors will
be brought to slips as fit as a fiddle.
Russell and Wilson nre running a pair
of real good ones, namely. Lady Herscholl
and Lady Emma. The latter bitch. Imme
diately after arriving here two weeks ago,
hit the talent so hard that the boys are
not likely to forget her name lor some
time.
Handy nnd Smith are running a string
of corkers: greyhounds that have won
stakes both in Eastern meetings and in
California. Smith and Sweeney, thf-ir
trainers, never run a dog until he is right.
A. Massey has a pair that the wise ones
will have to look out forâ that Is, the old
reliable and several times stake winner
Hadowlst, the other one being his grand
performor Llghtfoot, a bitch that has set
many prizes in the East to her credit.
A. "L. Sears is in with another good one
named Hotstuff.
In the run-down of the stake there are
openings for the knowing ones to fall in
deou. |On Grizzle will doubtless sell on
the short end In her race against Eclipse,
but if the dog is in anything like good
shape he is very liable to raise a flag.
The courses which readers of The Call
should have a care in playing are Nog. 1,
5 9 11, 18, 31, 32, 38, 40 and 44. Doubtless
several dogs that will figure as favorites
in the betting and whose names will ap
pear on the card opposite the foregoing
numbers may see their Waterloo. Bet
ting on hound racing can be made profit
able only by keeping track of the past
performances of the dogs and the condi
tion which they are in when handed to
the slipper. Last Saturday The Call
missed only four races out of the large
number that figured in the run-down and
tho Sunday tips were also successful in i
a grent measure.
In the run-down of to-day s Dig stake
the winners should be:
Eclipse, Twin City Girl, Black Hawk.

Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
VANCOUVER, Feb. 24.â"Unfortun
ate New Guinea. She has been de
vastated by two terrific cyclones which |
I have filled the land with horrors. The I
j inhabitants are in sore distress. Moth- â â 
I ers have sold their children into slavery
to buy food. Hundreds are on the j
verge of starvation. We must have j
j help."
So writes the Rev. Dr. Brown, gen
| eral secretary of the Foreign Mission
ary Society, stationed at New Guinea.
His story of the terrible conditions pre
vailing in the cyclone-swept land is
told fully in the mail advices brought
yesterday by the steamship Miowera.
Dr. Brown says now that details
of the destruction caused by the cy
clones are coming to hand he is more
than ever convinced New Guinea na
tives must receive assistance from the
outside world or die like dogs. The
furious elements leveled the native Huts
by thousands, and in some instances
whole rows of houses, sometimes a
hundred at a time, went down like lines
of balanced dominoes pushed to their
fall by a child's hand. During the first
cyclone trees falling or flying through
the air caused the death of many, while
a steady avalanche of uprooted timbers
kept tumbling down the mountain sides
on unprotected villages with their frail
houses. Dr. Brown writes:
It was simply a Niagara of twisted tree
: trunks, tangled roots and huge rocks
I which leveled to the ground more than
[ one promising village. By this avalanche
! scores of native converts were crushed to
death, while all the banana and yam gar- j
dens were destroyed, thus cutting off the ;
natives' means of subsistence. New
born rivers are now rushing and roaring
where life-sustaining yams a short time ;
ago grew in abundance.
"We have no time for prayers." say my
converts to me. "We can only look at
our ruined huts and cry."
All the churches and schoolhouses were
blown down. All the mission boats were ;
i sunk at their moorings or blown out to j
I sea~ I have counted twenty-flve vessels |
i lost off this coast during the cyclones and
I hundreds of natives were killed by fall
ing trees and terrible mountain ava- ;
lanches. Some of the converts were so
appalled by the disaster that they, have :
! gone back to the old religion and customs.
Mothers are again selling their children
into slavery for food to keep life in them.
In one instance a native mother traded
three of her young children for a 14-year
old boy who could help her in the struggle
; for existence.
Dr. Brown says the hurricane did one
particularly strange thing. In its mad
pranks it plowed up a prehistoric |
graveyard in the valley of the Sagania
River The natives informed the doctor
j they had found skulls of great size In
I the pits laid bare by the cyclone. Some |
i had long hair and all were suggestive ,
;of ages long ago. The bones of animals :
; of a kind never before seen or heard
of in New Guinea were exposed. They
had apparently been buried beside the ;
! human kings of a forgotten race.
CONCATENATED ORDER
OF THE HOO HOO
BLACK CAT HOLDS HIGH REVEL
AT AN INITIATION.
Candidates Inducted Into the Mys
teries of the Nine Lives of
the Somber Feline.
The Concatenated Order of the Hoo Hoo I
held its first Initiation of the Hoo Hoo I
year Thursday night in Encampment ;
Hall, Odd Fellows' building. The ceremo- |
nies of the order, which are most unique, j
commenced at 7:30 o'clock and it was j
! after 11 p. m. before the last of the eight- !
een candidates was taken into the. mystlo j
' circle and the black cat, which had hel.d
high carnival during the ceremonies, had
! given its last meow.
At the close of the ceremonies the thir
ty-seven ancient and respected Hoo Hoos,
i together with the eighteen novices, went
to a restaurant on Market street, where
they partook of an elaborately prepared
bHriquet, at which C. J. Church, the
snark, presided. While the vow of silence
prohibited the new members of the order
! from expressing their feelings, they lls
| tened to responses on other topics which
' the snark suggested. Those who respond
i ed were: S. L. Everett, A. Kendall, Nat
Harris, J. J. Logic, Walter Sutton and S.
: J. Hendy, and Arthur J. Kennedy favored
with excellent vocal selections.
Hoo Hoo is a society of lumbermen and
those connected most closely with them in j
business relations and numbers about six !
â¢ thousand members throughout the United
' States and Canada. It was founded in
1592 and bases its ceremonies upon the !
; black cat with its nine lives. About six !
hundred men on this coast are enrolled ,
among the worshipers of the great Hoo |
Hoo, and the order is epjoying the great
est of prosperity, both financially and so
cially.
The badge of the Hoo Hoo consists of a
small button bearing upon its face the
I mystic black cat, with curled tail, with a
: white background. The officers are nine
! in number and are called the Snark, the
; senior Hoo Hoo, the junior Hoo Hoo, the
! bojum, jabberwock, custoeatton, scriven
i otor. gurdon and arcanoper. Among j
i prominent members of the order resident j
in this city are Charles Johnson of the I
Union Lumber Company, George D. Gray
of the prominent firm of Gray & Mitchell,
C. J. Church of Crane Company, S. L.
Everett of the Pacific Coast Wood and
Iron, J. J- Loggle of McKay & Co., Man

for a Tugboat Collision.
Captains Bolles and Bulger, United
States Local Inspectors of Steam Ves
sels, yesterday filed their decision In the
matter of the collision between the tugs
Sea Queen and Mlllen Griffith on Febru
ary 7 They held that Captain Driscoll of
the Millen Griffith and Captain I. L.
Smith of the Sea Queen were equally
blamable for the collision, because they
neglected to blow the danger signals and
to stop and back. Their licenses were sus
pended for thirty days. The damage dono

Service on the lowa.
About two hundred Christian Endeav
orers went out to the battleship lowa last
night to attend a service under the aus
pices of the Christian Endeavor Society
of Calvary Presbyterian Church.

followed by an address of welcome by
Rev. F. Brown, chaplain of the lowa,
and a response by Dr. John HemphiU.
Other addresses were made by O. C.
Wheeler, chaplain at Mare Island, Fred
Hunt and Mr. Eden. Music wa^ furnished

rence, E. C. Gilbert. B. Mcbougald and
A. S. Johnson. The service closed with a
benediction by Rev. E. A. Dugan.
CYCLISTS AND THEIR TRAINERS
Hale Pays His Debts and Now Aron
son May Be Arrested.
Teddy Hale, the ex-champion cyclist,
had his case dismissed by Judge Graham
yesterday, as he was man enough to see
that his trainers were paid the money he
promised them.
Oscar Aronson, the cyclist who won
the second prize, will also probably be ar
rested to-day. Yesterday " K }?*'L S. y ?Â«;
his trainer, applied to Judge Graham for
a warrant for Aronson's arrest, a.s ne
had reason to believe he intended lea\ing
the city without paying him. Kyan said
that Aronson had agreed to give him
$100, but as West, Miller's trainer, was
called in to assist on the fifth day. Aron
son refused to give the $100 but offered
to make it $50. Now he refuses to pa>
anything. The Judge said he would issue
the warrant to-day.

WILL BUILD
A FAIR SHRINE
TO ORPHEUS
Claus Spreckels* Mu
nificent Gift.
MUSIC STAND FOR THE PARK
BUILDING TO COST NOT LESS
THAN $60,000.
A Marble Peristyle, Dedicated to Mu
sic, to Be Erected Immediately
on a New Site by the
Capitalist.
Through the generosity and public spirit
of Claus Spreckels a magnificent music
Stand, to cost at least $60,000, is to be im
mediately erected in Golden Gate Park.
This munificent gift to the public -was
unexpectedly made at a meeting of the
â  Park Commissioners yesterday.
Mr. . Spreckels. through his son Adolph,
the Park Commissioner, informed . the
board that he desired to build a perma
â  nent music stand of marble or granite,
the minimum cost of which would be $60,
--000. The donor also agreed to furnish
: plans for the structure. On behalf of the
.' . citizens of San Francisco the Park Com
â¢â¢: mlssioners gladly accepted the splendid
â¢ .offer.
Music lovers and those who have had
\ the artistic improvement of the city and
;. park at heart are delighted beyond ex
..' pression Ht the grand gift of Mr. Spreck
. ./els. Several attempts have been made to
eecurn a beautiful music stand, but the
projectors were always unsuccessful. The
! -old location is inadequate for the immense
.;-\_. crowds which frequent the park, and the
Bhell in which the band now plays is
â 'â  neither a thing of beauty nor a conven
ient site.
The new music peristyle will be erected
â where the Administration building of the
' Midwinter Fair stood. The Park Com
â  rnlssioners will prepare the ground and
!" 'Supply the benches, and Mr. Spreckels
will defray the cost of the beautiful build
ing. The plans are not drawn yet, but
architects will be employed immediately
and within a few months the work of
construction will begin and the beautiful
monument to Orpheus will be quickly
completed.
Park Commissioner Frederick W. Zeile,
speaking of Mr. Spreckels' gift, last even
ing said:
"It is one of the grandest acts ever per
formed by a public-spirited man. A hand
eome, enduring building, dedicated to mu
sic, is now assured the public. The pres
ent and coming generations will be bene
. flted and uplifted by the generosity of
' Mr. Spreckels. The commissioners are
â  only too glad to leave the selection of a
design to the donor, as we are certain
that an exquisite bit of architecture will
beautify the park.
'â¢The .site fs beautifully adapted to a
music building and is the most accessible
in the park. When completed the great
crowds that go to the park to listen to
the music will be easily accommodated.
Thanks to Mr. Spreckels. San Francisco
will have tho most beautiful music build
ing In America, if not in the world.
PUBLIC PARK VEHICLES.
Merchants' Association Wants Cheap
Conveyances in Golden Gate.
A mwempnt Is on foot by the officers of
the Merchants' Association that is cal
culated .to be of great benefit to the gen
eral public and give thousands of people
an opportunity of seeing all the sights in
Golden Gate Park in one day. a privilege
now denied them by reason of the great
distances and the numerous attractions.
The proposition is to secure a cheap
tpeans of transportation, similar to those
In many of the Eastern cities. The mat
ter has been laid before the Park Com
missioners and it is believed the proposi
tion will be a paying one to that body.
The sucpestlon is that the commissioners
shall secure three or four large open
wagons, capable of holding from a dozen
to sixteen people, that shall make regular
trip? around the park, taking in all the
.â¢principal points of interest. The fare
should be small so as to be within the
â¢ reach of all. L. M. Kins:, superintendent
.of' the association, was recently in the
â¢ E&ft and found that in many cities public
conveyances in public places are paying
â¢' Institutions, beside accommodating an ap
.preciating public. In discussing the mat
. .ter, which has been laid before the Park
Commissioners. Mr. King said:
â  â¢ "The vehicles should start from both the Stan
â¢ yari street ar.r] thp Fulton street entrances'.
There 1? hardly any doubt that such a service
â â¢â would pay its own expenses and leave a profit
' <or the Park Commissioners to spend on im
.prpvements at the park. If, as a beginning,
NEW GALLERY FOR
THE ART INSTITUTE
Edward Searles Will Erect
an Annex for Exhibi
tion of Paintings.
EDWARD F. f3EARI.ES will add another gallery to the Hopkin* Institute of
Art. The plans were submitted to him and he has announced that the con
struction will commence at once. The limited space in the present building
has been a matter of comment among artists for some time. Pictures
placed on exhibition could not be displayed to the best advantage, and as a re
sult many of the leading painters have sought the walls of other galleries upon
vrhich to hang the products of their skill. This fact was made known to Mr.
Searles, and he immediately notified tfte board of directors of the institute that
he- would stand the expense of providing additional room.
The additional structure will be placed on the southwest corner of the build
ing: and will extend from the octagonal conservatory to the Mason-street line
on the west, running parallel with the main building southerly toward Pine street.
It will have a length of 105 feet and a breadth of 43 feet. The interior height will
be 21 feet, of which IB feet will be reserved for pictures, and thÂ© remaining six
will be set with frieze extending from the paneled ceiling downward. The Interior
finish will be of wood. A large gabled skylight, below which will be a glass
ceiling, will light the gallery. The floor plans call for maple. The exterior will
be in harmony and keeping with the building proper.
The cost of the annex will approximate $17,000. One of the present conserva
tories will be removed, but the octagonal one will remain Intact. The construc
tion of the building will bo let to the lowest bidder and such notice will soon be
made public. , j
MISSION ROCK, WHICH WILL BE TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR A COALING
STATION AND SUPPLY DEPOT.
the service was tried on Bun<says, when there
are crowds anxious to see the park, there can
be no doubt that It would be a profitable under-
not interfere with the carriage and
hack trade from the livery stableÃ. Parties
who can afford to take a carriage or hire a.
horse and buggy will do bo anyway. But there
are thousands of people going to the parlc who
cannot afford to hire a carriage, and are not
able to walk over more than a small portion
of It who would welcome an opportunity to be
driven through it co as to pass the principal
attractions for the small sum of 10 cents. There
are large numbers of tourists and visitors who
have not the time nor money to spend in nir
ing a carriage and taking half a day to explore
the park thoroughly, but who would be glad to
ride out on the street oars and then be able
to take a public conveyance and be driven
around over a route which would in the short
est time enable them to see the principal fea
tures at a email expense.
If the Park Commissioners do not care to
provide their own conveyances they might mako
arrangements with some one of the carr.ag*
mmpanies by which it would furnish and main
tain at the park a certain number of vehicles
which would make regular trips for a fixed
price per passenger, and In return for the
privilege turn over to the park a percentage of
the receipts. I believe that such a service at
the park would be appreciated and commended
by all citizens.

REMAINS TO LIE IN STATE
REQUIEM MASS AT ST. MARY'S
CATHEDRAL THIS MORNING.
John W. Mackay Generously Remem
bered the Bereaved Family of
His Old Friendâ The
Pallbearers.
1 : "
IN MEMORIAM.
Cherished and honored beyond all others.
Loved and looked up to as dearest and best.
Noblest of natures and kindest of brothers.
Truest of souls that a friend ever blest;
Could you but speak to us, poor dead one lying
Cold In thy casket; and If It were meet
That you could whisper us, "Hush and cease
sighing-,"
Even our grief for you then would be Â»weÂ«t-
Oh! but 'tis hard to feel we, left behind youâ
We, sore and sorrowing, here by your bier â
Never again in this life may remind you
How much we- worshiped you, how held you
dear.
Hand, cold and motionless, though wÂ« may
clasp you â
Hand, true and faithful, now rigid and prone â
Though we may cling to you, fervently grasp
you,
No pressure shall thrill In response to our
own.
Eyelids now closed in the last solemn slumber.
Would that beneath you our own eyes might
see
One glance of the many that beamed without
number.
Soothing our troubles or brightening our glee;
Voice that once flowed like a beautiful riverâ
In song, sweeter than song-birds' most ex
quisite trillâ
How can we feel that you are silent forever,
Your glory departed, your melody still?
Ah! but we'll keep thy grave green with love' a
fountains,
And close in our hearts a grave greener for
thee.
With a grief that shall last, friend, as long
as the mountains.
As deep and unchanged as thÂ« sob of the sea.
The heart-place left vacant shall never, oh,
never,
By another be claimed, by another be filled.
Until we, too, lie down In thy calm sleep for
ever.
And our pulses, like thine, friend, forever are
stilled.
â From Dan O'Connell'B "Lyrics."
When Dan O'Connell wrote "In Memo
rlam" a score of 'years since he little
thought he was singing: a requiem which
to-day touches a responsive chord on the
heartstrings of the multitude of friends
who loved him in life and grieve at his
death. Around his bier, to-day, those
same friends will gather, and with sad
dened hearts gaze for the last time upon
the clay from which the poet soul has
fled. In the green room of the Bohemian
Club, where his brilliant wit and quaint
philosophy have so often cheered his
companions, the body of Dan O'Connell
will lie in state from 8 to 10 this morning.
The Bohemian Club, though appreciat
ing that all men loved their dead brother.
Jealously claim him as their own, and
to-day they will leave all else to honor
his memory.
At 10 o'clock the funeral cortege will
leave the Bohemian Club and proceed to
SJ. Mary's Cathedral, where a solemn
requiem mass will be sung for the repose
of the soul of the lamented litterateur.
The cathedral choir, under direction of
Organist Harrison, will sing* the mass,
and H. J. Stewart, vice president of the
Bohemian Club, will preside at the organ.
After the service at the cathedral the re
mains will be taken to Calvary Cemetery
and placed in the Coleman mausoleum.
Before the benediction at the grave is
pronounced. President J. A. Thompson of
the Bohemian Club will make a few re
marks.
The Â»ntlrÂ© Bohemian Club will act as
honorary pallbearers in addition to Wil
liam Berg, Dr. Jerome A. Hughes, F. W.
Croudace. James B. Gill, T. J. Schuyler,
T. F. Meagher, Captain Smith, George T.
Knox, Captain Nat Messer and Frank
Cummins, all warm personal friends of
the deceased.
Alexander Gunn of Cleveland, Ohio, and
Dan O'Connell were the closest friends.
Mr. Gunn is in the city and has probably
the last letter written by the lamented
Bohemian. It was written a day or two
before the fatal attack of pneumonia and
is in Dan's usual vein, as follows:
LAUREL. LODGE, Sunday Morning.
[Given from our Royal Couchâ to be deliv
ered by one of the Princesses now brewing tea
at our anointed elbow.]
Come over on the 10 boat and we will have
a ramble. It is our earnest hope that your
Majesty's royal cabesa may be free from all
pains. " Come to our soothing zephyrs and be
soothed.
Oh, the guile of Gill! The guile of Gill!
"For, Alick, beware of that owl of the night.
He drinks and he runs away." DAN.
Mr. Gunn kept up an unbroken corre
spondence wjjth his friend for years and
he has a number of beautiful poems as
yet unpublished. He will undoubtedly
send copies to James V. Coleman, who
will be Dan O'Connell's literary executor.
It was reported yesterday that Mr. Cole
man will collect all of the dead poet's
work, but wilf only publish a limited num
ber of volumes, which are to be given to
Dan's friends.
John W. Mackay yesterday gave a gen
erous and tangible evidence or the affec
tion he bore "dear old Dan" by sending
a check for $1000 to the bereaved widow.
No services of any sort are to be held
at the Bohemian Club this morning and
the club will be open to members only
while the remains of Mr. O'Connell are
lying' in sta^e.
Minus Salaries and Positions.
M. W. Hamilton,. William Dietz, Jack
Davis, Joe Hambaugh and Henry Morri
son are bewailing the loss of their salaries
and their positions. For the past half
year they have been employed as mall
drivers by the Midland Mail Company,
but owing to a disruption in the latter
firm the men have not been able to col
lect their pay in two months. On Tues
day they were told that the company had
given up its contract and they were no
longer needed and their services were no
longer required. The men appealed to the
Postmaster, who yesterday had each
driver prepare a statement of the amount
due him, and the papers will be Imme
diately forwarded to Washington for set
tlement. > â  â â â â â â - â ;,-â ;.: -â  'â -;.â >â =

CREDITORS MEET.
Sam and Julian Waller Will Prob
ably Be Forced Out of Business.
The creditors of Waller Bros., the Grant
avenue druggists, who are on the verge
of bankruptcy, held a meeting: yesterday j
afternoon and appointed Messrs. Reding
ton and Mack a committee to meet the
Waller boys and effect a settlement.
After the meeting Mr. Redington and
Mr. Mack had a long talk with both mem
bers of the embarrassed firm. It was
agreed that Sam and Julian Waller
should meet their creditors to-day and
discuss terms upon which an immediate
settlement could be made.
"We want to pay all our debts if we
have to go out of business." said the ex-
School Director when seen last night.
"Our creditors held a meeting this after
noon and we agreed to meet them to
morrow and make a settlement. I do not
care to discuss my financial affairs in the
newspapers, therefore I am not at lib
erty to state just how much our liabili
ties will amount to. In all probability
this trouble will force us out of busi
ness."
TOOK "ROUGH ON RATS."
Mrs. Minnie Owen Committed Sui

TRIED IT ON THE DOG,
BUT IT DID NOT WORK
William Boyle Sought to Die by Morphine, but
When His Canine Friend Survived a
Dose He Used a Pistol.
WILLIAM BOYLE, a waiter who has been unable to find a place where hÂ«
could wait, became despondent several days ago and determined on sui
cide. He had heard of the old adage, "Try it on the dog first," and be
fore attempting to end his life by morphine administered a large portion
of the drug to, a stray canine he picked up on the street. The essence of the
poppy did not agree with Bruno, and when his stomach refused to retain it
Boyle became convinced that the adage was to be depended upon and decided
that morphine was not the thing to use upon himsolf. After considering the
matter for a week, the despondent waiter determined to kill himself with a pis
tol, and profiting by his first experience with the dog. last night put a bullet
into himself -without first perforating his canine friend.
For. a number of years Boyle has been employed in San Francisco as a
waiter at a number of restaurants, but his age has prevented his securing
steady employment for over twelve months. He has had odd jobs from time to
time, which have kept him from starving to death: but nothing has come his
way which would allow him to lay aside a little money for a rainy day. The
proprietors of the ' What Cheer House, on Sacramento street, have employed him
at different times and allowed him to room at their place when he was out of
work. In the last six months Boyle worked two weeks, and the run of hard luck
was more than he could stand.
Two weeks ago he secured a large quantity of morphine, enough to kill a
regiment, the doctors say, and picking a dog up on the street administered a.
quantity of the drug to him. The dog threw up the stuff and survived the
experiment. Boyle, thinking the morphine was not good, decided to kill him
self with a pistol. Last night he fired a bullet into his left breast. The bullet /
struck a rib and passed around the back, lodging under the right shoulder. He
was taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where Dr. "Yon der Leith removed
the bullet and made the patient as comfortable as possible. While the wound is
a serious one the physician does not think it wiil prove fatal.
At the hospital last night Boyle stated that his reason for wishing to end his
life was that he could secure no work and he said that he was sorry he had not
succeeded In bis attempt. He refused to tell where he secured the morphine.
NAVAL SCHOOL
TO BE ERECTED
IMMEDIATELY
| Work Now Begun on
Yerba Buena Island.
CAPTAIN GLASS COMMANDANT
THE GOVERNMENT TO EXPEND
$150,000 AT ONCE.
The Building of the Training Station
Has a Very Significant Bearing
on the Future of San
Francisco.
The passing of Goat Island Is a thing of
the near future. When the Government
recently decided to establish on this coast
a Naval Training School the Bureau of
Navigation selected as a site the island
that rises from the waters of the bay mid
way between San Francisco and Oakland
and the bureau also decreed that hence
forth the island is to be officially known
by its original name of Yerba Buena. The
Government will expend In the erection of
this Naval Training School nearly $250,000,
although of this amount only $180,000 has
at present been appropriated. For the
purpose of erecting the buildings and
wharf, making the roads and digging the
well which is to supply the water, $150,000
is to be expended within the next year,
while the remaining $30,000 of the first
appropriation is for the maintenance of
the school.
Captain Glass, who commanded the
Charleston when that vessel was sent to
Manila, and of whom It may be said there
is no more efficient officer in the navy, has
been selected by the Secretary of the
Navy to have charge of the new train
ing school. He is to supervise its erec
tion and to have entire control. In the ad
ministration of the training school he will
be assisted by three other officers.
The preliminary work on Yerba Buena
Island has already been commenced. All
of the island with the exception of that
portion on which is located the light
house and the torpedo station has been
turned over to Captain Glass for the
Naval Training School. Eight months
from now will see the school practically
completed and with a capacity for accom
modating 500 boys who are to be trained
to be seamen.
Captain Glass visited the island yes
terday morning for the purpose of in
specting the progress of the work. He
went over on the tug Vigilant, accom
panied by engineers, who made the final
survey for the buildings. The work on
the graded road, which is to lead to the
wharf, has already been commenced, and
the well which is to supply the water will
have been dug and finished by the middle
of next week. While the entire middle
portion of the island is to be given up
to the school, the buildings and wharf
are to be erected on the southeastern side
of tne island, between the lighthouse and
the torpedo station. The buildings will
comprise the residence of the command
ant quarters for three other officers and
the barracks, and the latter will include
the steam power and electric plant. AH
of these buildings will have a southern
exposure and will be protected from the
western winds by the high crest of the
* The specifications for the Naval Train
ing School have already arrived from
Washington, and bids will be opened at
the Bureau of Navigation on March 15,
and as Captain Glass said yesterday, he
hoped that the work of erecting the
buildings would be begun by the first of
April In the meantime the work on the
road to the wharf will be rapidly pushed
forward and the driving of the piles will
be commenced next week. It is neces
sary to complete the wharf so as to be
able to land the building material as it
is needed. After the work on the school
is actively commenced it will, in the opin
ion of Captain Glass, take about six
months to complete it. In the meantime
the enlistment of boys who are to be
trained will continue. Boys are being en
listed at present, and even now there are
about 200 of them on the receiving ship
Pensecola.
The Pensecola will soon be brought
down to Yerba Buena Island, and it is
possible that Captain Glass may at once
make his headquarters on the vessel for
the purpose of better superintending the
work He will also shortly have under
his command the United States tug Vigi
lant, and, in fact, she will be turned over
to him just as soon as he secures a crew
for her. In addition. Captain Glass, when
the school is completed, will have a
iy-foot launch for the convenience of
)fflcers and their wives in plying be
n the Island and the city. Besides
Pensecola, Captain Glass will have
Adams as a cruising ship and possl
me other for the same purpose.
=Â» building of this Naval Training
ol on Yerba Buena Island by the
rnment has a very significant bear
m the future of San Francisco. It
8 plan of this Government to have all
s seamen trained sailors when they
ito the service. The erection of the
jl clearly indicates that the training
>1 at Newport, R. 1., is not capable
naining enough boys at a time, which
indicates the intention of the Govern
ment to greatly increase the navy. This
being the case, and the fact that the
school is to be here, points to the fact
that as a result of the newly acquired
possessions of the United States this city
Is to become a great naval base. For- I
merly it was found necessary to send
East for trained sailors when they were
desired, but in the future this will not be
the case. The school means that the men
that go into the navy will be of a higher
class in all ways, and the fact that San
Francisco is to be a naval base meana
that trade is expected by the Govern
ment to increase proportionately.
This is strengthened by the fact that

BUNKO MEN ARE STILL
WORKING THE HOTELS
C B. PENNY OF AUSTRALIA THE
LATEST VICTIM.
Registered at the Palace on Thursday
and Soon Parted With. Over
Five Hundred Dollars.
Clifton R. Penny, who registered at the
Palace on Thursday morning from the
Menzies Club, a wealthy social organiza
tion of Menzies, the metropolis of the
gold fields of Western Australia, is the
latest victim of the confidence men who
are plying their nefarious vocation
around the hotels. The gullible gentle
man parted with $540 after becoming ac
quainted with some of the "sure thing"
gentry, and that, too. almost before his
name had time to dry on the register.
He has been in this country for several
months, having been touring the large
cities of the East. He evidently did not
read the article in Sunday's Call, which
tol-i of four guests at the California who
had been swindled in various amounts
ranging from $15 to $250. Therefore when
an affable individual accosted him in the
hotel corridor almost immediately after
he registered, he and his new-found friend
went on some pretext or another to a
place on Sutter street and his money went
with him.
It is the same old story of the poker
game, the invitation to the unsophisti
cated stranger to take a hand which
proved his undoing. Penny appears to
have been an unusually "good thing," for
after losing $40 in coin which he had with
him he proceeded to lose $500 more. Not
having the ready cash he offered to draw
a check for the amount. Of course the
harpies protested, fearing that the
check would be served likewise. Then
Penny, after remarking that his word was
good for any amount in his country, de
liberately went with the steerer to the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank and drew $500
in cash, which he handed to his newly
made acquaintance.
The paving teller of the bank, who wit
nessed the transaction, saw Penny later
in the day. and after a little investigation
the latter came to the conclusion that he
was "up against it good and hard." He
was a cheerful loser, however, and realiz
ing that he had been not "penny wise but
pound foolish," he naively said, "Well,
it's my own fault and serves me right."
He resolved to get out of a country which
had used him so illy and immediately sent
his effects on board the Moana, which
sailed yesterday with Penny as one of her
passengers.
Detective Ross Whittaker has been put
on the case, but so far the bunko people
have not been apprehended.
