CANDIDATES FOR
THE SPEAKERSHIP
Payne of New York
Enters the Race.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 22.â The Wash

telegraphs: Sereuo E. Payne of New
The San Francisco Call.
Van Ness avenue the people of
San Francisco will gain a new
park of possibly greater popular
benefit to the generality of San
Franciscans than the present
great pleasure-ground.
A new pleasure-ground will be
I created for the benefit of the
, many and not of the few. A
splendid recreation ground de
signed for the great mass of the
people will be established. Those
that can ill afford carfare to and
from Golden Gate Park will have
in the extension of the panhandle
a superb park within easy access.
It will be but a step from the
bustling, business thoroughfares
of the city. The original plan of
the founders of the Golden Gate
Park will have been carried into
realization, and San Francisco
will have a park designed for the
masses and not alone for the few.
While Golden Gate Park is
admittedly a park for the people.
and, on holidays, is thronged by
thousands of men, women and
children seeking recreation, the
pleasure-ground is, nevertheless,
too remote for the daily presence
of many thousands more who
want a place of pure air, green

Mr. Reed resigns. This proviso must
be made, for who knows that Mr. Reed

tion of the city people have been
agitating for years for new parks.
Improvement clubs in every dis
trict voice the want. Thousands
of men and women flock daily to
the downtown * reservations that
are inadequate but accessible.
The extension of the panhan
dle on the lines proposed 'would
satisfy a want that "with
every year is growing * greater.
The people of the city need a
great park in their midst, and
they will fight against real es
tate speculators,' wealthy land
owners and private selfish power
to obtain it. The people of San
Francisco were forced in the first
instance to tight against corrup
tion to win Golden Gate Park,
and even then the land-grabbers
and real estate speculators won
for themselves the very land
which it is now proposed to use
as an extension of the panhandle.
The people will renew the strug
gle with their ballots and will
find opposed to them wealth and
power. â¢
Men that can afford to drive
to Golden Gate Park do not
want an extension of the pan
handle. It is their, privilege to
use the great stretch' of pleasure
that time?"
"I don't know that there is any
hurry about that. Not much can be
done until just before the reassembling
of Congress. During the last contest
for the Speakership I was not ap
proached for my vote until after I ar
rived in Washington for the winter's
work."
Mr. Payne expects to have Represen

Illinois, Cannon of Illinois and Sher

the opinion that the President would
remain neutral in the Speakership con

Men that have property on the

will oppose extension. Those
that see nothing in the future- of
the city and care nothing for it
will be in opposition, and on
these lines a great battle for the
city will.be lost or won.
It will be' argued . against ex
tension that the expense will be
too great and that its burden
should not be placed upon the
people of the city. This argu
ment is over thirty years old. It
robbed the people of San Fran
cisco out of a splendid public
reservation that was designed
to extend from Stanyan street to
the sib? of the City Hall. This
argument was made when the
lines of Golden Gate Park were
fixed, and it was made by men
who said that some clay the prop
erty would be of enormous value.

They have property and business
interests -involved. They have
built up a trade or profession and
must necessarily suffer, whatever
they may be paid for -their hold
ings. They have in the district
a capital that is valuable in great
measure simply by virtue of lo
cality. * This they will lose in con
fiscation, and. having acquired
ownership in honorable ways,
they are fearful of the result. In
being forced from their present
holdings to contribute to a gen
eral public good they must start
anew in other districts almost
with the same disadvantage as if
they migrated to a' new* city.
This condition of affairs is a
serious one and has already, re
ceived some attention: There is
a disposition on the . part of
nearly all who have discussed the
question to do all in their power
to induce the appraisers of 7. the .
property to place liberal esti
mates upon holdings, having in
view in the estimates the loss
that private citizens, merchants,
tradesmen and professional men
will suffer in the confiscation.
Those who oppose the pro
posed extension of the panhandle
can with their opposition only
postpone an action that inevit

Franciscans have seen for many
years the loss they suffered in not
securing the panhandle thirty
years ago. It is inevitable that
some day the extension will be
made, and it can lie done now
more cheaply than it will be
later. The extension of the pan
handle is a public necessity, a
need of the general public, of the
.or and not the rich.
An argument has been made
that the city has greater and
more pressing needs than the ex
tension of the panhandle. Resi
dents of outside districts want
improved sewers, public build
ings, schools, hospitals and ade
quate quarters for the Fire De
partment. The Mayor and
Board of Supervisors have wisely
considered these needs and have
provided for them in the pro
posed bond issue. The local au
thorities are not blind to the
present needs of the city nor to
its future welfare. They seek to
provide for both in the proposed
legislation and popular indorse

TERROR INSPIRES
HIS CONFESSION
Murderer Confronted by
Victim's Corpse.
Special Cable to The Call .-.:*.<! the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1-99, by James Gor
den Bennett.
PARIS, April Crimes have been
a feature of the week, the number of
which is exciting public notice in Paris
at the present moment, it is gui! ex
traordinary, equally remarkable being
the fact that bestiality, nOt theft, was
the motive for a great majority.
The police captured under curious
circumstances a man who murdered
and assaulted a little girl in Chuis-y-
Le-ROi about a week at-*". Tin- day
after the murder the police made a big
laid In the district, arresting all sus
picious characters. Many of these were
convicted of bondage or other of
fenses and sent to prison. Among them
was a miserable-looking young ii... of
about .''*. named Sautton, who later in
j.i [son boasted to a fellow prisoner thai
he had had something to do with
the Chois-y-Le-Roi murder. The fol
low prisoner was a detective posing as
a prisoner with the object of working
out the secrets of the real prisoners- a
common dodge of the French police.
He informed the Governor of the
prison.
The young man at first denied the
murder, though he admitted the as
sault. Eventually he was confronted
in a theatrical manner with the corpse
of the little girl at the Morgue*. The
corpse of little brielle Martin lay
covered with a shroud. on a table, and
as soon as Sautton appeared the shroud
was quickly removed. The murderer
covered his face with his hands so as
not to see th.- corpse.
"Look," said M. Ie Mercier. the exam
ining Magistrate. "Look, Sainton, at
your victim."
A so:-, from the trembling prisoner
was the only reply.
"Will you look, Sautton?" command
ed 1..* Mercier more emphatically. "Do
you recognize Louis Gabrielle Martin?
Do you recognize the little girl you
murdered?"
The shivering wretch opened his fin
gers slightly, .as! a hurried glance at
the corpse, th- muttered:
"Yes, sir; that's her."
Ordered to repeat his confession,
Sautton told th.- ghastly tale again.
Unable any longer to prevaricate in the
presence of the corpse, this time he
gave the full details of the outrage. At
his conclusion M. le M. rcier asked:
"Do you repent your crime?"
Sautton broke Into a violent fit of
weeping.
"Have pity." he cried, clasping his
hands. "I want to go away: I want to
go out. Have pity."
Accustomed though he is to violent
emotions of criminal confrontations.
M. le Mercier was much moved at this
dramatic scene.
When the confront was over
Sautton signed a written report of his
confession.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
SUCCESSFULLY TESTED
NEW YORK. April 22.â A special cable
to the Journal from Paris says: De
Ducretet, the eminent French electrician,
who, like Marconi, has been experiment
ing with wireless telegraphy and is a sci
entist of. high repute in France, made
some experiments the other day. In the
presence of Consul General Gowdy, Dep
uty Consul Bowen and a correspondent,
he transmitted a message from one cham
ber in his laboratory to another, the wall
being no obstacle. I 'ucretet then dictated
the following:
"My invention will enable us to send
telegraphic messagos without wire from
Paris to Xew York. Transatlantic ca
bles are so costly and cumbrous that
they will soon be abaiidened. By reason
of the rotundity of the earth we would
require two poles, one in Paris and the
other in New York, three thousand feet
high. If this height is impracticable we
can make fast a- receiving pole in mid
ocean and keep a man there to transmit
messages. This pole must be twelve hun
dred feet ligh. The automatic recorder
that ] invented needs no man. [I re
cords messages while a man sleeps, and
will be of the greatest use for ships and
an Incalculable advantage during wars."

GAGE WAS READY
TO NAME BURNS
"Mexican Dan" Opposed
the Scheme.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 22â Opinion is
divided here as to whether Governor
Henry T. Gage will emulate the prece
dent of Governor Stone of Pennsylvania
and appoint Dan M. Bur:.s to fill the
vacancy in the California United States
Senatorship. The adherents of Burns
insist that the phraseology of Governor
Stone's document fits the case in Cali
fornia, and that an opportunity is pre
sented to repay political obligations.
The statement is made by those who
profess to know that the Governor
stood prepared to issue to Burns a com
mission on the day the Legislature ad
journed without reaching a conclusion
in the Senatorial imbroglio, but, know
ing that two other Governors issued
commis.ions that proved worthless in
similar instances, Burns was too
shrewd to take this chance, and dis
couraged the plan.
Senator J. J. Boyce of Santa Barbara,
who is in the city, is quoted as hav
ing said that Governor Gage was cer
tain to name Colonel Burns as the suc
cessor of Stephen M. White, and that
he might not wait for further action in
or settlement of the Quay case. Sen
ator Boyce said he found divided senti
ment here among Republicans as to
whether the Republican State Commit
tee ought to be reorganized. He is as
staunch an adherent of U. S. Grant as
he ever was, and would, he says, in
the event of an extra session of the
Legislature, take great pleasure in
again voting for that gentleman for
United States Senator.
When the Senator was asked whether
he would agree to go into a caucus to
determine the Senatorship, he declined
to make any statement. ,
Walter F. Parker, whose friendship
for Dan Burns is admitted, gives it as
his opinion that Burns will not be ap
pointed until after the United States
Senate shall have passed upon the
Quay case next winter. 'yy
The efforts of those who are opposed
to Burns are rapidly crystallizing into
organized strength- as an anti-Burns
movement for next year's State cam
paign. This concentrated power will
be prominent In the legislative pri
maries, and in the southern counties of
the State the fight will be between the
Grant forces and the Burns crowd.
The discussion as to the possible del
egates to the National Convention next
year from this end of the State has
brought to the fore Brigadier General
H. G. Otis, who, it is said, will be of
the chosen few. as a Republican dele
gate at large, providing he is willing to
make an alliance with the machine
leaders. Congressman R. J. Waters
may make a dash to be selected as dis
trict delegate.
On the Democratic side Stenhen M.
White will he one of the four delegates
at large. The choice of a district dele
gate will engender- the usual party tur
moil.

LEWIS M. CLARK
COMMITS SUICIDE
MEMPHIS, Term.', April Colonel Lewis M. Clark of Louisville, the
well-known racing judge, committed suicide here to-day in his room at the
Gaston Hotel. .;-'-.;7 *' '.."'vy
Colonel Clark had been indisposed for several days and Thursday even
ing he requested President Montgomery to take his place in the judges' stand
on Friday, saying that he would not leave his hotel. Last night Colonel
Clark was attended by Dr. Johns, who announced that his patient was suf
fering' from melancholia.
Colonel Clark was up. early this morning, but did not leave his room. He
ordered a drink of brandy shortly before 9 o'clock and seemed to be in good
spirits. At about 9 o'clock a revolver shot- was heard in Colonel Clark's
room. The door was forced and Colonel Clark was found lying across the
foot of the bed with a smoking revolver in his hand. A small hole in the
right temple, through which blood was slowly oozing, told the story. Colo
nel Clark was writhing in great agony. Efforts to revive him were of" no
avail and he expired without speaking.
The news of the suicide caused a sensation among horsemen. Colonel
Clark was extremely popular in Memphis, having acted as presiding judge
at the spring races for a number of years. lb- was a member of the local
clubs and was prominent in social and business circles.
The Jockey Club has elected 11. H. Heed presiding judge to succeed Clark.
LOUISVILLE. Ky.. April *22.â Colonel Lewis M. Clark was born In St.
Louis, Mo., in 1846, and was the son of George M. Lewis Clark. His grand
father was Governor William M. Clark of MissouYi. Colonel Clark was one
of the most notable' figures of the American turf. Over twenty years of his
life were devoted to it, during all of which time no breath of scandal has
ever assailed his name. He was the author of a majority of the turf rules
or laws of the present time, and was one of the founders of the Turf Con
gress.
THOUGHT DREYFUS
WAS INNOCENT
M. Monod Gave Telling
Testimony. â¢
sreeiai Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. April 22.â The Figaro, con
tinuing its publication of the testimony
given before the Court of Cassation in
the Dreyfus revision proceedings, to
day rtrints the depositions of Gabriel
Monod, M. Hanotaux, former Minister
of Foreign Affairs; Count d'Aynac and
General Mercier.
M. Monod, in the course of his testi
mony, said that at the end of Decem
ber, 1894. he dined with M. Hanotaux
and asked him if he was certain of the
guilt of Dreyfus. To this query the
Minister replied: "It was not I who
tried him. I have nothing to say."
After dinner M. Hanotaux's secretary
said, when both were in the street:
"You know General Mercier committed
a frightful blunder."
Thenceforth M. Monod doubted the
guilt of Dreyfus. He investigated the
matter and became convinced that Es
terhazy was'the author of the bor
dereau. In March, 1897, he wrote to
M. Hanotaux imploring him to say if
he believed Dreyfus guilty, but he re
ceived no answer to the letter. Subse
quently in his presence M. Hanotaux
said: "The only thing for which 1 can
never be consoled is the Dreyfus af
fair." Later he (Monod) wrote to M.
Hanotaux, who replied: "I am trying
to obtain certainty. It really needs
more than a firm conscience. We re
quire a superior light to guide us in
the darkness of this matter."
M. Monod said that when he was in
Italy the Marquis Visconti Venosti and
other generals, among them Rlcoti,
Gonsulez, Primano and Guerini, told
him that the Italian Government did
not have any documents received from
Dreyfus, but had several from Ester
hazy.
It was not until 189S, M. Monod said,
that he came into relations with Colonel
Pic-quart and the Dreyfus family.
M. Hanotaux, in his deposition, ex
plained how, owing to the persistence
of General Mercier, the proceedings
against Dreyfus were commenced in
spite of his (Hanotaux's) protests on
the ground of the diplomatic side of the
affair. International difficulties arose
as the prosecution progressed. M. Hano
taux said that he never saw a letter
from any sovereign on the subject, that
none was ever offered him and that the
whole story was a fable.
He had never expressed an opinion
as to the guilt of Dreyfus and he had
not answered M. Monod because he did
not feel called upon to express an opin
ion In writing. In conclusion he said
that his real opinion in the matter was
In conformity with the indications he
had given the court.. 7-

WANTS A CHINESE
MURDERER PUNISHED
Korean Legation at Washington Takes
Acton Regarding a Mayfield
Crime.
SAN JOSE. April 22.â Investigation into
the killing of Lv Chlong Sang, a Korean,
at Mayfleld on October 9, 1898, is to he
made .at the instance of the State Depart
ment at Washington. A Chinese named
Gee Suey committed the murder. The
men quarreled In a gambling-house. At
the preliminary examination- held a few
days later Gee Suey was dismissed from
custody on motion of B. A. Herrington,
who was then District Attorney, because
tin evidence was not sufficient to warrant
a trial.
Several prominent Koreans of San Fran
cisco took deep interest in the case and
hired attorneys to prosecute the China
man. They were incensed at the dis
missal of Gee Suey. The case was re
ported to the Korean legation at Wash
ington, and in turn brought to the atten
tion of the State Department. Governor
Gage was asked to look Into the matter,
and hi has requested District Attorney
Campbell to supply a certified copy of the
testimony taken at the examination.'' It
is found that no transcript of the testi
mony whs made. /.--."

RALE IN POWER
TILL NEXT JULY
Change at San Quentin
Delayed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN, April 22.âWarden
Hale will not relinquish his position
until July 1, in order that the vast
volume of business to be transacted
between the present time and harvest
ing season may be disposed, of without
the complications likely to arise from
an inexperienced man taking charge of
prison affairs. 'This was decided upon
during an executive session of the
Board of State Prison Directors to-day.
Martin Aguirre. Hale's successor, will
not be appointed until the May or June
meeting. The matter was formally
placed before the board in the shape
of the following resolution, unanimous
ly adopted:
Resolved, That the term of the State
Warden of the State Prison at San Quen
tin be for four years, to commence on the
Ist day of July, 1899.
Resolved, That the term of the incum
bent, W. E. Hale, shall be extended to
that date and until his successor shall
have been elected and .qualified, and for
the purpose of saving the giving of a
bond this resolution shall be construed
as an extension of the present term.
The meeting of to-day was of special
importance on account of the fact that
the nine men charged with a conspir
acy to escape from prison were brought
before the board and a thorough in
vestigation made as regards the data
in the possession of the prison officials.
Some startling facts were developed,
among them being an admission by
Cooper that when he told the Warden
he had seen the revolvers said to have
been smuggled into the penitentiary
he prevaricated; the statement of -the
same person that Guard Shields bought
a quantity of poison at Mack &
Company's wholesale drug store in San
Francisco, which was to be used to out
the guards to sleep, on an* order from
Cooper under the name of Harry C.
Parsons, M. D.; a further statement
that Parsons was the stool-pigeon's real
name; the introduction of evidence
showing that. in case the scheme failed
Captain Edgar and Sergeant Ellis were
to be decoyed into the carpenter shop
and killed with hatchets; and finally,
an admission by Captain Edgar him
self that he and Guard. Randolph had
kept the fact of the conspiracy from
Warden Hale until 9:30 o'clock of the
evening on which the men* were thrown
into the dungeonâ March 3.
The trial of. the men was conducted
in Captain Edgar's office and occupied
all the afternoon. On the table had
been placed a large number of knives,
razors, slungshots and keys, a hatchet,
a hammer wrapped with chamois skin,
drills, saws, picklocks and other in
struments and tools the men intended
to use in attempting to gain their lib-,
erty.
"I learned on February 1," said Cap
tain Edgar, "that a break was to be
made. The news came from good au
thority through Guard Randolph. We
thought it best to keep quiet and did
not even tell the "Warden until the
night the conspirators were arrested.
! Then we .three and Captain Birlem held
a consultation and concluded to place
! the men in the dungeon. Cooper did
â  not confess, as has been stated. We
j. learned he was in tjhe plot and sent for
him on the last Sunday in February.

j ..pressure and told us he had seen the

'Joyous is the First Sight of Spring."
How does it find your health bank account? Here are
some points worth considering from a financial standpoint.
4 * Misfortunes Never Come Singly. "
It is said that ninety-five out of every
hundred business men meet misfortune at
some stage in their lives; some recover
and some do not. If the remedy in busi-
ness life were as easily found as in the
ills that beset humanity, there would not
be so much misfortune.
In the latter case, multitudes ivhen
attacked by rheumatism, scrofula and
other diseases, flee for protection to
Hood's Sarsaparilla, and they find there
a sovereign and specific remedy.
Hood's Sarsaparilla possesses merit peculiar to itself. It is the
specific of the age for all blood troubles. The liver, kidneys and
bowels are all toned up by its adipn as a cleanser, the
nerves are made strong and steady, and thus good health ensues.
Honesty Is the Best Policy/
Never was a more pointed saying put
; into print, and yet to be honest only be-
cause it is policy is a poor kind of hon-
esty. Better change 44 policy" to 44 prin-
ciple' and the world wilt like you better.
In the medical world there is one
medicine honest for principle's sake-
Hood's Sarsaparilla.
ââ____ . * Â»
'/â â â  It acts promptly for both sexes and all ages.
Hood's Pills cure liver ills; the non-irritating and only cathartic to take
with Hood's Sarsaparilla, the Best Spring Medicine Money can Buy
pistols, which he thought he could find.
He failed to do so.
"Cooper used to be a physician," con
tinued Edgar, "and confessed to me
that his intention while on the mid
night watch was to â¢ put 'knockout
drops' in the coffee of the guards. The
intention was then to unlock enough
cells to let about five hundred prison
ers out and all would have escaped
over the walls."
. Warden Hale summoned Edward
Morrell, who is regarded as the prime
mover in the conspiracy. The man
was very defiant. He bitterly assailed
Cooper, and said the stool pigeon had
come to him a dozen times with wild
cat schemes to get out of the peniten
tiary, but he paid no attention to them
because he distrusted Cooper.
George Schlegal said he had made
keys and given them to Cooper. Si
1-overi'n admitted he had advised
Schlegal to have nothing to do with
the plans. Cooper had told him he had
a rope, knife and keys and said he had
led the others to believe he would 'dope'
the guards, but that he intended to
follow another plan. A pretended con
fession was to he made to Captain Ed
gar and then Edgar and Sergeant of
the Night Watch Ellis were to be de
coyed into the carpenter shop on the
pretense of showing them where the
weapons were hidden; "There they
were to be hit on the head with . a
hatchet." The guards were then to be
overpowered. . He knew' nothing about
any revolvers.
Bullock, Gould, Chevalier,' Shaw,
Roupe and King were summoned in
succession. All tried to shield Morrell
and Schlegal.-
Cooper was summoned last as the
star attraction, and before the board
had*. finished questioning him several
things hitherto unknown to any ; of the
prison officials came out. 7, A sensation
was caused by Cooper saying that when
he told, the Warden he had seen the
revolvers he prevaricated.' He. was so
sure the weapons were hidden some
where, he said, he thought it would be
a greater credit to him to make the tale
strong. ' Cooper adhered, to his story
that he had been told by Morrell that
Guard Shields had brought the pistols
into the prison, and added that Shields
also had brought in the "knockout
drops." In explaining this Cooper
caused surprise by saying his true
name was Harry C. Parsons and that
he held a physician's certificate.
"I made out an order,", he said, "for
a quantity of chloral hydrate, digitalis,
belladonna" and aconite. I gave Shields
a total of $46 given me by Morrell and
he went to San Francisco and pur
chased the' poison' from Mack & Go.,
the wholesale druggists, about two
weeks before we Were arrested. I
know he got the poison there because
the bottles', were- labeled. The order
was signed 'Harry C. Parsons. M. D.'
At Devlin's suggestion the Warden
will prepare a synopsis of the evi
dence and the relative degree of culpa
bility of the prisoners and action re
garding punishment will be taken at
the next meeting. Devlin said in his
opinion Cooper should be watched"
carefully in order to prevent the other
convicts taking his life. All the mem
bers thought Cooper had been punished
enough, as he is in very delicate health.
Schlegal and Morrell, as the principal
ringleaders, will be placed in the in
corrigible ward as soon as it is fin
ished. ; ;
On recommendation of Warden
Hale, during the morning session, the
final step was taken toward the con
struction of a separate ward for in
corrigibles. The plans are for the
construction of cells partly of wood
and partly of iron at a cost of $1148.
Professor Gardner of Cooper Medi
cal College, who had sent in a request
to the Warden that the law concerning
the disposal of the remains of deceased
prisoners be complied with, will be in
formed that hereafter such shall be the
case. The law requires that the bodies
of persons dying at a public institution
shall be sent to a medical college for
the advancement of scientific research
when' provision has not been made for

44 One Good Turn Deserves Another."
It is easy to go through life doing
good and helping to make others happy.
A lady who had been ill with a compli-
cation of troubles, having been thoroughly
cured and now enjoying perfect health,
felt it a duty to tell her friends that the
specific that brought her back to health
was Hood's Sarsaparilla.
Thus, after Hood' had served her well,
she felt it deserved a good turn at her hands.
Thousands tell the same story of blood
purified and health restored.
44 Like Diamonds Raindrops Glisten."
Drops of Hood's Sarsaparilla are pre-
cious jewels for the blood which glisten
in their use, and, like the rain, disappear
for the good of humanity. Each dose
is in a very short time thoroughly mixed
with the blood and actively engaged in its
work of purification â curing scrofula,
salt rheum and all blood humors.
burial of the remains by relatives or
the deceased has made no expression
of desire for interment.
Owing to the unsanitary conditions
prevailing In the prison grounds and
the danger of the total destruction of
buildings by fire th.- warden was em
powered to receive bids for the laying
of water mains, with hydrant and hot._
attachments, at a coat of $1679.
The report of Expert L. Wadham
shows the books of the prison to be
in proper condition and the available
funds for the balance of the fiscal year
to bo as follows: General apportion
ment for supplies, $34,630 37; same for
salaries, $19,975 30; State Prison fund.
$5558 98. The revolving fund of the
jute mill is up to the $100,000 standard.
The report of Warden Hale on jute
and grain bags was as follows:

THE DRILL WORK OF KNIGHTS
TEMPLAR AT SACRAMENTO
SACRAMENTO. April 22.â From 10,
--000 to 12,000 people filled the new
pavilion to-night and witnessed
the closing feature of the Knights
Templar conclave. The affair marked
an event in Masonic circles which will
long be treasured in the annals of the
order in this section of I â â â â  State. It
seemed that all Sacramento had turned
out to pa; a farewell tribute to the dis
tinguished organization which has been
the guest of the Capitol City tor three

would be a large attendance at the ex

Tiers twenty high had been erected so

employed extensively to heighten the ef

The drill corps participating ii the

rounds of applause as they executed

to the vocal burst of enthusiasm.
The drill was kept tip until a late
hour, the grand officers reviewing it
from their position; and then dancing
was in order. The drilling by a corps

much enthusiasm, and at its close the

CONTUMACIOUS
WITNESSES WILL
BE PROSECUTED
ROBERT MAZET, Chairman of the Legislative Investi
gation Committee Now in Session at New York.
NEW YORK, April Eeyond the enunciation of a stringent line of ac
tion against contumacious witnesses, the preparation to make a speedy
example of one individual, to-day's sessions of the Mazet investigating
committee were comparatively uninteresting and unimportant. Neither
Mr. Croker nor any of the better known persons associated with him was
examined, and the affairs of the Tammany leader did not come into promi
nence. After one more session, on Monday, it is announced the committee
will adjourn till May 9, and In the interval, it Is presumed, it will submit a
preliminary report to the Legislature and possibly proceed against several
witnesses for contempt.
To-day's proceedings opened with an investigation of the proceedings In
this city of the Maryland Whisky Company. Mr. Moss had several times in
timated that this brand was being sold through the influence of city officials.
Samuel Mcir. . a Broadway tailor, who, Mr. Moss seemed to think, had fur
thered the sale of the Maryland whisky, refused point blank to answer a
number of questions, and Chairman Mazet directed that counsel should bring
Meirs before the court for contempt as soon as possible. The other witnesses
called confined their testimony almost entirely to the building department
and the various systems of fire-proofing.
The proceedings opened in a somewhat sensational manner. Proctor Clarke, as
sistant counsel to the committee, addressing Mr. Mazet. -aid he desired to .call the
attention of the committee and of witnesses to the Penal Code sections which provide
for a year's Imprisonment or a fine of ISOO, or both, for refusal to answer questions
propounded by the committee of the Legislature.
"You will observe," said Mr. Clarke, "by contumacious refusal to answer proper
and material questions, a witness commits a misdemeanor. It is the purpose of the
counsel, with the approval of the committee, at the proper, time, to be determined by
the Judgment of the counsel to the committee, to cite such contumacious witnesses who
have refused to answer such proper questions to the constituted criminal authorities of
this county for presentment, indictment and punishment, not for a moment doubting that
the constitutional officer of this county, the District Attorney, will lend his aid to the
proper observance of the laws of the State."
â Mr. Clarke went on to state that If it were impossible for the Grand Jury of this
county to spare the time to deal with cases of contempt, the counsel for the commit
tee would request the Governor to appoint a Judge to hold an extraordinary term of
the Supreme Court and to impanel an extraordinary Grand Jury before which the
matters could be brought according to the existing laws governing such cases.
Dr. O'Sullivan. representing the city departments, referred to Mr. Clarke's an
nouncement as "intimidation."
Mr. Clarke protested against the use of that word, and Mr. Mazet ruled that Dr.
O'Sullivan had no right to use It. The Tammany counsel, however, continued and
said: "I contend that this committee Is not the Judge of questions as to their material
ity or propriety, and also that you are not the Judges as to whether a witness ls con
tumacious or not,"

BERLIN, April 22.â The meat in- j
spection bill in the Reichstag and the j
Midland Canal bill in the Diet have j ;
engrossed attention this week through- j
out Germany. The Agrarians and the i
Reactionists oppose both measures, and j
the ultimate fate of the bills will be j
interpreted as evidence of the fighting j
strength of the parties.
The canal bill occupied more time in â 
the Diet than did the meat inspection
bill in the Reichstag, the first reading
of the latter requiring two days, while :
the former took five days. Both bills
have gone to special commissions, j
where they will probably be much al- !
tered, possibly more than acceptable to
the Government, in which case they i
may be withdrawn.
The ranks of the opponents of the
canal bill were strengthened this week
by the accession of Baron yon Stumm,
also called the Coal King, and former
bosom friend of Emperor William, a j
fact which is much commented upon,
in view of his Majesty's predilection for
the project. The Government thus far
does not fear the entire failure of either
measure' I
Regarding the meat inspection bill, I
j which more directly touches American j
I interests, there were many interesting
features in the Reichstag debate. The I
; leading Agrarians made a point of aim- j
i ing their remarks and gestures at Pro- i
i fessor Stiles, the scientific attache of
j the United States Embassy, ho was J
present at the debate but who has now j
| started for home on account of family
matters. Trichinosis was hardly dis
; cussed by any of the two score speak
ers, and the charge that American pork
frequently contains trichinosis, which
until a year ago was constantly reit
. crated in the Reichstag, was not once
! made on the lloor of the house. This
shows that the irrefutable scientific
proof to the contrary advanced by Pro
fessor Stiles has been accepted as' con
clusive by even the wildest Agrarians.
It was also notable that the debate
was practically a repetition of the
statements made to the army beef In
vestigation, with the worst evidence
and bitterest construction of all sorts
of American press comment. The rep
utation of leading American packing
houses was torn to shreds by quota
tions from American publications,
| which were read in extenso or sum- ;
! marized by Ilerren, Klinkowistrom,
! Wangenfeim, Vielhaben, Sieg or other
Agrarians. It may be assumed that
, this would be the line of argument fol
lowed b the opponents of the bill. The
comment of the press this week, when
in sympathy with the Agrarians, al
most entirely consists of a reiteration
of the charge, which one paper puts
j tersely, that "this American meat, ;
I which Germans are expected to eat, ;
j has been found by the highest Ameri- ;
I can investigating committee unhealthy j
and even deadly to America's own ;
army of strong, lusty men."
It is out- of the question that the bill j
can pass in its present shape, and it is
( merely a question as to how much it \
i can be altered without becoming un
acceptable to the Government. Its op-
I ponents wish above all the following :
j changes: The abolishment of the pro
vision making a double inspection com- j
pulsory, even on cattle slaughtered for
domestic use: to put foreign meat on i
the same footing as domestic meat in j
the matter of Inspection: to take the
execution of the provisions of the bill
out of the hands of the Bundesrath and
fix them In the bill, as one speaker
ADVERTISEMENTS.
INTENSE SUFFERING
FROM DYSPEPSIA AND STOMACH
TROUBLE
â
Instantly Relieved and Perma-
nently Cured by Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
A New Discovery, but Not a
Patent Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an Interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
cure of acute stomach trouble and chron-
ic dyspepsia by the use of the new dis-
covery, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: "The patient was a man who
had suffered to my knowledge for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate seemed
to sour and create gases in the stomach;
he had pains like rheumatism in the back,
shoulder blades and limbs, fullness and
distress after eating, poor appetite and
loss of flesh; the heart became affected,
causing palpitation and sleeplessness at
night.
I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
1 blood remedies, but to no purpose. As an
i experiment I finally bought a fifty-cent !
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at !
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
most immediate relief was given and after
he had used four boxes he was to all ap-
pearances fully cured.
There was no more acidity or sour wa-
tery risings, no bloating after meals, the
appetite was vigorous and he has gained
i between 10 and 12 pounds in weight of
; solid, healthy flesh.
i Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are j
! advertised and sold in drug stores, yet I !
â  consider them a most valuable addition j
|to any physician's line of "remedies, as
i they are perfectly harmless and can be
| given to children or* invalids or in any
j condition of the stomach with perfect
safety, being harmless and containing
nothing but fruit and vegetable essences,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
Without any question they are the
safest, most effective cure for Indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or i
severe."
Stuart's dyspepsia Tablets are made by I
the F. A. Stuart Co. cf Marshall. Mich., j
and are sold by druggists everywhere at I
fifty cents per package.

said, "to remove it from the diplomatic
dickering field with foreign countries."
If its opponents accomplish this, as
seems to be likely, the bill will be un
acceptable to the Government and will
undoubtedly lead to a tariff war with
the United States.
The above statements are the result
of the inquiries made on the subject
by the correspondent here of the As
sociated Press. An American exporter,
who is in the confidence of the Wash
ington administration and who is now
here, said bluntly:
"If Germany passes a law requiring
in addition to the American official cer
tificates, of the healthy condition of the
meat exports, which are as reliable aÂ»
the German certificates, a double in
-1 spection after the arrival of the meat
i here, that will be tantamount to a pro
! hibition against American meat, and
[ such action will doubtless be answered
! by retaliation on German exports to
the United States. Every bottle of Ger
man wine will.be opened and its hy
gienic qualities tested."
A strong point in the speech of the
Minister of the Interior. Count Posa,
; dowski-Wehner. was that the bill was
intended by, the Government as a
"transitory measure until Germany
produces enough meat for her own peo
ple, which, it is believed, will not take
long."
The correspondent learns from the
best sources that while the State De
partment at Washington has from time
to time instructed the United States
Embassy to present the American i
: view of the differences which have i
| arisen on the subject of the "most fa
vored nation" clause in the commercial
| treaties, formal instructions have not
| been received at the Berlin Embassy
' looking to the negotiations for an en
i tirely new reciprocity treaty..

SALINAS READY
FOR THE COMING
OF THE NATIVES
To=Day the Delegates to the
Grand Parlor Will Be Given
a Welcome,
SALINAS. April 22.â At last, after
weeks of splendid planning and the en
thusiastic can ing out of plans by en
ergetic 'committees, arrangements are
completed, the preliminary work is ac
complished, the decorations are placed
and all is ready in Salinas for the visit
of the Grand Parlor of the Native Sons
of the Golden West. Even the smile of
welcome has been donned by the Sa
linasites and cordiality, good fellowship
and a week of royal entertainment
await delegates who are to arrive to
morrow. The city in its gala attire lÂ«s
a pleasing sight, for all the business
houses and hotels and many private
residences are decorated. The yellow
symbol of California gold, the tint be
loved of the Native Sons of the Golden
West, has literally flooded the city. It
mingles with the national colors in the
draping of buildings; it (lies in stream
ers from points and pinnacles; it pre
dominates everywhere. The decora
tions are very artistic, though not so
elaborate as they might be. Lines of
banners of all nations, the stars and
Stripes and the California bear Hag pre,
dominating, are Ing at intervals on
Main, Alisal, Gabilan and Castroville ;
streets, alternating with lines of gor
geously colored Japanese lanterns,
which when lighted will produce a bril
liant effect. A bandstand, elaborately
..rated, has been erected on Main
street, where public concerts will be
given every afternoon and evening of
the week. Salinas has so armed her
entertainments that the delegates will
find a continuous' round of pleasure
from the time of their arrival to the
end of the week.

The May Queen will be crowned with
great pomp. She will be attended by
a full court composed of knights, squires,
pages, jesters, maids of honor, etc.
Beautiful costumes arc in the course of
preparation for this feature. The con
test for tho election of the Queen has
fairly aroused the whole city, and the
great question in Sacramento to-day is,
"Who is to be Queen of the Slav.
mother? Who is to be Queen of the
May?" The visiting Sir Knights have en
tered into the spirit of the contest, and
they are among the most liberal patrons
of the ballot-box.
The four prominent candidates arc Miss
Petrie. Miss Hammond, .Miss Hems and
Miss Heltman. Miss Petrie Is the daugh
ter of one of Sacramento's prominent cit
izens, who is, by the way. a past com
mander of the Grand Commandery of
the State. Miss Hammond is the popu
lar bookkeeper in the Golden Eagle Ho
tel, and the patrons of that hostelry are
making great efforts in her behalf. Miss
Hems is a bookkeeper In a large mer
chandise establishment in a portion of.
the city where a great many Sacramento
shop men live, and they are doing good
work, as the Hots show. Miss Alma
Heltman; who leads the votes to-night,
is the daughter of J. H. Heitman of this
city. She is a beautiful young woman of
the brunette type. She has many friends
among the young people, many of whom
are making a personal canvass. This is
the first contest of the kind that 'ever
took place here, and the result will be
looked forward to with more than ordi
nary interest.
A large class of young girls is being
trained to take part In the May-pole
I ters of the local parlors of both Na
tive Sons and Native Daughters. Santa
Lucia Parlor, N. S. '*. W., has arranged
convenient and comfortable smoking.
â  reading and lounging rooms, and a
committee will always be in attendance
to attend to the wants or answer the
Inquiries of guests.
The Native Daughters have taken
possession of the rear rooms of the
same building, beautifying them in
the dainty and artistic way which only
women understand, and making them
the most attractive of all the rendez
vous in the city. The reception commit
tee, some of whose members will al
ways be present at headquarters, Is
posed of Mrs. L. G. Hare, Mrs. J.
Stirling, Mrs. A. McCandless, Miss Mac
â  I 'at ton. Miss Mabel Harvey, Miss Na
talie Clark, Miss Edith Baker, Mrs. E.
A. Baton, Mrs. Harvey Abbott, Mrs.
, S. N. Matthews, Mrs. C. N. Blanchard,
[ Miss' Grace Shearer, Mrs. A. Harris,
i Miss Bee Porter.
Other places at which a hearty wel
come will be extended to the visiting
parlors are the armory of Troop C,
National Guard of California, and the
City Hall. The reception rooms at both
places are beautifully decorated. At
the City Hall some of the city officers
will dispense the city's hospitality,
while a detachment of Troop C will
preside daily in their especial domain.
The armory proper will have the fin
ishing touches of its decorations given
later, as it is there the grand hall and
the annual banquet are to be held. The
plan is to decorate it with especial
elaboration, much expensive material
as well as elegant cut flowers and
potted plants to be employed. Mr.
Pratt, the official decorator, has de
signel and is supervising the work at
this particular place.
All the business sessions of the
Grand Parlor will be held in the opera
house. where special preparations have
been made for th' comfort and con
venience of officers and delegates.
A committee composed of P. E. Zab
ala, E. J. Harris, L.â U. Grant, E. A.
Eaton, DA. Porter and others from
Santa Lucia Parlor of Salinas went to
San Francisco to-day to participate in
tie high jinks which Stanford Parlor
gives to-night in honor of the visiting
delegates in San Francisco en route
here. All the delegates now in San
Francisco will lea. there at 9a. m.
to-morrow for Salinas. At San Jose
the ]'if- Regiment Band will meet
â  them and accompany them here.
Gabilan Parlor of Castroville. and the
Casti oville Brass Band will meet the

gates to a reception and luncheon,
after which all will proceed to Salinas. !

dance. For this event, also, elaborate
preparations are being made. The par
ticipants will be handsomely dressed in
patriotic colors, carefully designed by
proud mothers.
There will be a Cairo street, lined with
booths of all kinds, and the air will re
sound with the stentorian voices of ama
teur spielers. These booths will be pre
sided over by the young women of Cali
fla Parlor, Native Daughters.
There will be a football game, a base
ball game between members of Sacra
mento and Sunset parlors of Native Sons,
and a baby show. This last feature is to
be a particularly interesting affair, as
Sacramento is proud of her reputation as
a producer of attractive youngsters.
There will be an immense band con
cert, accompanied by a large chorus, with
artillery effects. There will be many
other features sufficient to entertain all.
This is an opportunity that Sacramento
has been waiting for, and now that it is
here it Is Intended not only to rival* but
surpass similar celebrations in Southern
Cauifornia. The flowers here are both
bounteous and beautiful. There are
many up-to-date carriages here, and
Dewey day in Sacramento will go down
in history as one never to be forgotten
by those who will be so fortunate as to
be here on that occasion.

ihe trip will be of national Importance
and several representatives of the United
States Government will be among those to
profit by it.
The ship will be equipped so that much I
scientific work can be done on board She
will carry many guides, packers and bear
ers, so that all sorts of journeys of explor
ation inland may be made. To a great ex
tent each member of the party may work
independently, having an outfit and ser
vants placed at his disposal and having
only to notify Mr. Harriman of the nature
of the experience he desires and to name
the place at which he will rejoin the shin
As for the route, all. that has been de
cided as yet is that the steamship will
make the inside passage to Sitka, thence
to Cooks Inlet arid around Kadiak Island
Even these plans may be modified to meet
the wishes of members of the party or to
follow up some line of investigation which
may suggest Itself later. Almost every
branch of scientific research will be rep
resented, and Alaska will be scanned and
sounded from every point of view
Leland Stanford University of Califor
nia will have one representative at least-
Professor C. H. Gilbert. As another Cali
fornia representative it is expected Pro
fessor John Muir will go.

COPPER QUEEN GROUP
OF CLAIMS JS SOLD
REDDING. April 22.-The Copper Queen
| group of claims in Trinity County has
; been sold to a Napa company, composed
of Henry Brown of the Bank of Napa and
Schuppert and Buckman, owners ofthe old
Spanish mine in this county, also of Nana
, The deeds of the property will be trans
ferred on Saturday. The amount of
! money involved has not yet been made
i public. The Copper Queen is situated
â¢about five miles north of Trinity Center
and a mile oast of Carrvllle, on the Trin
ity River. The men who relinquish own
i ership to the property are William Voll-
S?,_ rs ' -^? m I!llk '' ' Frank Pimmick and
Ellas Ellery. The property is immensely
rich in copper, carrying carbonate ore
which can be easily treated. The Copper
Queen is well developed, having over 300
feet of tunnel. It was successfully worked
in the seventies by William Andrews
when the ore had to be freighted to Red'
; Bluff and then shipped down the river
One lot of 2800 pounds sent down by Mr
| Andrews yielded 1800 pounds of pure cop
! per. It is estimated that there are over
i 200,000 tons of ore in sight. The purchas
ers will go to work immediately on an ex
tensive scale. Messrs. Brown & Schup
pert went to Napa on Wednesday night
to be prepared to turn over the purchase
money, while Mr. Buckman went on to
San Francisco to place an order with the
Union Iron Works for a furnace for a
i forty-ton smelter, which will be erected
j immediately.
MANY BEOUESTS OF
BARONESS HIRSCH
The Will Not to Be
Opened Until May 1.
VAST SUMS GIVEN CHARITIES
TWO ADOPTED SONS LIBERAL
LY PROVIDED FOR.
In the Event of the ElÂ£er Dying
Childless Ten Millions More
Will Be Added to the
Amounts Donated.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
NEW YORK, April 22.â A World cable
from Vienna says: The will of the late
Baroness Maurice de Hirsch, which ru
mor says gives $100,000,000 to charities, is
not to be formally opened until May 1.
Although mention is made of bequests
to the extent of $100,000,000, the actual be
quests to charities so far disclosed aggre
gate only about $12,000,000.
The late Baron left $124,000,000, of which
$100,000,000 went to charities under his will,
which is equivalent to the sum now al
leged to have been devoted to charities.
So probably there has been some confu
sion between the Baron's and Baroness'
wills.
'I'll.- elder of the Baroness' two adopted
sons, Maurice de Forest Bischoffsheim.
gets interest on $10,000,000, and in the event
of his dying childless the principal goes
to charities. The second adopted son, a
permanent invalid, gets $100,000 per annum
tor life.
tor Baron Hirsch's New York fund for
the extension of schools and other insti
tutions there is $1,200,000; for the Oriental
Israelite Normal School In Paris and for
the maintenance of colleges in the
East, $800,000; for pensions to teach
ers In the same institutions. $600,000;
for feeding and clothing the poorer pupils
in the schools founded or to be founded
by the Universal Israelite Alliance, $500.
--000; for a loan fund of the Jewish board
of guardians in London, $600,000; for Baron
Hlrsch Institute in Montreal, $120,000; for
a home for Jewish working girls founded
by the Baroness, $600,000; for the com
mittee of Jewish benevolence In Paris
$100,000; for the Jewish Colonization Ass.,.'
elation in London. $5,000,000; for the Jubilee
fund in Australia started by the Baroness
for the support of boys and girls, $400,000;
for the Baron's primary schools in Ga
licia. $600,000. to which the Baron had al
ready devoted $6,000,000.
To each of the twenty officers of the
Paris Blenfaisance, $5000; for the Jewish
communities in Vienna, Bremen, Buda
pest!., Paris, Brussels, Mayence, Frank
fort-on-Main and Munich, sums aggre
gating $200,000.
The text of this document, if published
in full, will be found, it is said, to con
tain a passage of great general interest
referring to Princes and others in high
stations who were Indebted to the Hirsch
family in large sums.
The delay In publishing the text of the
document is undoubtedly due to influence
from the highest quarters here and In
other European countries.
CHINESE SUSPECTS ARRESTED.
FRESNO, April 22.-Two more Chinese

ENGLAND IN NEED
OF FIGHTING MEN
Recruiting Becomes a
Difficult Task.
ARMY'S WANING STRENGTH 1
GETS ONLY .THE DREGS OF THE
POPULATION.
Scotland Is Especially Backward, and
Even in Ireland It Is Harder
to Get Soldiers Than
Formerly.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, April 22.â A special ca
ble, to the World from London says: !
England must prepare to make a big :
financial sacrificg if she wishes to avoid
a conscription in some form. The mil- :
itary authorities here are at their wits' ;
ends to stimulate recruiting, which has j
shown a great falling off. It was de
cided recently to add another battalion
to the Scots Guard, but so few recruits [
have come forward that special per- j
mission has been . obtained to enlist ,
men in Ireland for this nominally Scot- j
tish regiment. But that is an old story,
as there are almost as many Irishmen I
as Scotchmen in some of the most fa
mous fighting Highland regiments.
Despite all the fresh inducements of j
pay and . pension recently offered, in
volving a large additional charge on j
the nation, the army is getting only ;
the dregs of the population. Scotland j
especially is backward. Even in Ire- i
land it is harder to get soldiers than '
formerly.
This state of affairs is attributed in
some measure to the Improvement in
trade and the consequent satisfactory |
condition of the labor market, for it |
is a known fact that except in a few j
districts in North England Englishmen \
rarely become soldiers except through
want of employment.
It is different in Ireland, but there j
political feeling is a great drag on re
cruiting.
Army reformers insist that the diffi
culty can be surmounted only by pay
ing at the rate of the labor market and
giving the soldier 24 cents a day clear
instead of deducting his rations from
that pay, as at present.
TOMB OFTHE POPE
HAS BEEN PREPARED
The Missing* Detail Which. Consisted
on an Inscription Is Completed
by His Holiness.
ROME. April 22.â Several years ago the
Pope gave the famous sculptor, Luchetti, I
a commission to construct a tomb for his t
Holiness, to be placed in the basilica of
St. John. The tomb is now complete in
every detail save one. It can be erected
in its place in a day or two. The missing
detail is now supplied. It is the Inscrip
tion, which the Pope once jokingly said he
would write as soon as there seemed to
be a likelihood of needing it. Last week
he composed the inscription and sent IE to j
Luchetti. It is in Latin and is very sim- .
ple, only the Pope's christian and family
names, date of birth, blank for date of
death and a few wojds recording Leo's
veneration for St. Thomas and St. An
thony.

MME. D'ALMA
JAILED BY MOORS
â -.-'..â¢'.. . â 
Arrested While Entering
a Mosque.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 22.â -According to
an account given to-day by Sic Hassan
Ben Ali, manager of a troupe of Ara
bian acrobats, a startling chapter has
been added to the already sensational
career of a young woman formerly the
wife of Rudolf Aronson, who, since her
divorce a few years ago, has been
known as Mme. Alma d'Alma. Ben
Ali said that Mme. d'Alma is at pres
ent a prisoner in the hands of the
Moors, and showed me a cablegram to
himself in which she announced that
she had been .arrested. The dispatch
was dated yesterday at Tangier, and
read:
Have been arrested while attempting
to enter mosque.
It was signed "Dalma." Ben Ali was
much perturbed over the tidings, . and
said he had grave fears that the pris
oner would be harshly dealt with.
Madame d'Alma Bailed from this city
on March 29 for Tangier with the in
tention of endeavoring: to obtain ad
mission to the harem of the Sultan of
Morocco for the purpose of studying
the life of the inmates.; Ben Ali said
that he made the acquaintance of
Madame d'Alma on board steamship on
the voyage from Mediterranean ports
*to this city. It was his account of life
in the Orient, he said, that suggested
to her the idea of traveling in com
paratively unknown portions of MoToc-
CO, He warned her that she would
probably have much difficulty in gain
ing an entrance to the harem of the
Sultan, but she determined to perse
vere in the adventure.
Ben Ali said that he learned of her
safe arrival at Tangier and of her de
parture from that place to go into the
interior with a caravan. The next
news he received was contained in the
cablegram. : >v:-
Allowing for the time elapsed, Ben
Ali said that he was pretty well sat
isfied that the arrest had taken place
at the town of Sidi Kassam Bo Assray,
a place which is celebrated for a
mosque of great antiquity and pecu
liar sanctity. This place is five days'
journey from Tangier and sixteen days'
journey by caravan from the city of
Morocco.
"I greatly fear." he said to-day,
"that Madame d'Alma is in serious
trouble. She was to travel in the garb
of a woman of the country in which no
objection would ordinarily be made to
her entering the mosque. She was ig
norant of the customs of the country,
and it is very likely that she com
mitted some breach of decorum which
would constitute a dreadful offense in
the eyes of a fanatic. Evidently she
managed to get a messenger through
to Tangier to send the cablegram.
This makes me think she has been sent
a prisoner to the Sultan at the city of
Morocco. In that case it will take con
siderable time before she can be com
municated with."
Ben All said he would. write to the
Secretary of State asking him to in
tervene in the prisoner's behalf.

Weekly Call,sl.oo per YearNATIONS WILL
NOT QUIT ARMING
Prediction of Failure of
Hague Conference.
Copyrighted, 1.?9, by the Associated Press.
LONDON. April According to ad- \
vices from excellent authorities, not
even the most sanguine, of those con. !
cerned now expect any substantial j
progress to be made at the coming
peace conference toward the disarma
ment or even a suspension of anna- I
ments. The Czar himself and his en- j
tourage are reported to have lost their j
Illusions on the subject, and it is said
that the proceedings and the treaty on
military and naval Questions will be
confined to the merest generalities, j
None of the decisions will be binding j
and even in the matter of international
arbitration, if anything is agreed to, it
will not be absolutely obligatory.
The British newspapers this week
have generally taken up the question
of Emperor William's choice of Profes
sor yon Stengel as a German delegate
to the conference, and it is pointed out.
Judging from his writings, he is a de
clared advocate of war and not of
peace. Therefore, the papers here con
fess to be nonplussed at his selection,
and declare it is hardly possible the ,
German Emperor can desire the sue- j
cess of the conference if he maintains ,
his nomination.
Extracts from Professor yon Sten
gel's pamphlet, "Der Ewige Friede"
("The Everlasting Peace"), have been
reproduced. Some of his references to
America are decidedly resting.
Alter declaring that the Germans, least j
of all nations, should support the "lan- ;
tastic aspirations of the friends of
peace," he says: The Americans, in- j
toxicated, will strive more and more to j
become the dominant power and die- i
tate their law to Europe in any con- [
test between America and Europe, j
Shall Germany stand peacefully to one i
side and bow humbly before America?
Certainly not. This is already impos
sible, because political dominion is also !
economic dominion, and Germany must
be politically and militarily powertui ill
she does not wish to go to economic i
destruction."
Further on. Professor yon Stengel de%.
dares that he does not know whether ;
it was "mere madness or crime when
perpetual peace was preached to the
German nation," and describes the 1
Czar's rescript as a "bombastically
composed document."
David Christie Murray, in the Lon
don Morning, to-day remarks that Eu- i
rope is anxious to learn if. after this
frank expression of his opinions, Pro
fessor yon Stengel's appointment will '
be confirmed by Emperor William, add
ing that if so, it would be a saving not
to hold the inference at all.
The proceedings of the British Par
liament this week were mainly of a
domestic nature. The Marquis of Salis- i
bury, who has returned to London j
from the south of France, reappeared '
in the -House of Lords Friday even
ing. His holiday on the Riviera has j
resulted in a great improvement in his i
health. Much amusement was caused
by the fact that he has had his usually
long hair closely cropped, with the re- j
sult, as one paper says, of "transform
ing him from a cavalier into a round
head."
The most interesting parliamentary
event *-> as the introduction by the
Lord Chief Justice, Baron Russell of
Killowen, of his bill against illicit Be
cret commissions in business, which
custom the report of the investigating
committee of the London Chamber of
Commerce recently denounced so
stronerly and urged the adoption of leg- j
islative measures to correct* it. Lord
Russell thundered against secret com
missions with an indignation which '
awed even the House of Lords. His
bill proposes to extend the law affect
ing public bodies to commissions on all
business transactions, making such
secret payments a criminal offense.
His lordship mentioned a number of .
cases, some of them very painful,
showing the prevalence of the system
and the jury done thereby to trade :
and morals.
The Lord High Chancellor, Earl
Halsbury. gave the hill a hesitating '
welcome, but the newspapers generally
warmly welcome the measure and urge
the adoption of its essentia] features.
The increase of the British garrison
at th( Cape of Good Hope from 3300
men three years ago to 9000 men has
been leading to the impression that
some movement was premeditated
against the Transvaal republic.
The Liberal papers to-day comment
upon the situation and ask if Great
Britain is preparing to seize the Trans
vaal. They point out that the perma
nent establishment of big garrisons In
South Africa is a complete reversal of
the old policy of withdrawing troops
from the colonies.
A big strike of miners has begun in
Belgium for an increase in wages
About 40.000 men are now out. a num
ber of factories are closing for lack of
coal, the bricklayers and masons are
Joining in the movement and disturb
ances are feared. The Socialists form
an important element among the strik- :
ers.
In consequence of the complaints of
French colonists that it is impossible
to find French wives unless they return
home, th*- Ministry of the Colonies in
tends to install a central emigrant of
fice for women in Paris, with branches' '
in the country. Approved maidens who '
are. accredited suitable for colonial
marriages will be provided with a wed
ding outfit costing $60, with $20 pocket
money and with a free passage to the

CARNIVAL QUEEN
IS NOW A BRIDE
Wedding Bells Ring Out
at San Rafael.
Prec.al T'ispatr'h to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. April 22.â A romance
which had its inception at Lake Tahoe
last summer came to a happy climax
at noon to-day in the marriage of Miss
Edna Rodden, one of the local society's
fairest belles, to Harry M. Martin of
Reno. Nev. .-7.'*
The ceremony was performed at the
Presbyterian church on Fifth avenue
and E street, Rev. Dr. Mackenzie of
San Francisco officiating. The interior
of the edifice had been transformed into
a floral bower, and the youthful couple
clasped hands under a huge wedding
bell of roses while the words were pro
nounced which made them one. The
bride was given away by her father.
Judge George Rodden. Edmund Stadt
\ muller of San Francisco acted as best
I man and the Misses Anna and Gertrude
Martin, sisters of the groom, as brides
-1 maids. Another sister, Miss Clara
: Martin, was maid of honor. The ush-
I ers were Dr. George Rodden of San
! Francisco, a brother of the bride; Roy
Baker of Oakland. John McDonald and
William L. Corrigan.
The wedding march from "Lohen
grin" was played by Miss Flora Mc-
Donald Graham, while Miss Maude
Fay, a college classmate of Miss Rod
den, sang during the performance of
the ceremony. A unique and pleasing
feature of the occasion was the intro
duction of little Lewis Raphael Corri
gan, the five-year-old nephew of the
bride, as ring bearer. The precocious
youngster. proudly took his place, bear
ing the ring upon an embroidered satin
cushion. Into the covering of which had
been worked in silk letters the initials,
"R" and "M," and. he seemed highly
disappointed because he was not per
mitted to place the ring upon his aunt's
finger himself.
The bride was charmingly attired It*

wore a tulle veil and carried a bouquet
of Bermuda lilies. The maid of honnÂ»
was richly gowned in pink silk and the
bridesmaids in dresses of white and
*-.'!â¢â¢' silk. * At the conclusion of the
ceremony the couple were surrounded
by a host of friends and showered with
congratulations. The guests then de
parted in carriages to the residence of
the bride's parents, where a. wedding
breakfast was served. The pair were
the recipients of many costly presents.
Miss Edna Rodden's popularity is
best estimated from the fact that with
out any effort on the part of her friends
she was unanimously selected from
among a large number of beautiful
girls to he the queen of the rose festi
val proposed last summer, a project
ultimately abandoned for various rea
sons.
Mr. Martin is nne of Nevada's pros
perous young merchants! The two met
at Deer Park Inn, Lake Tahne, last
summer, while their parents were en
joying the summer season at that re
sort. It was a case of love at first sight
and their betrothal was formally an
nounced a few weeks ago.
Mr. and Mrs. Martin will spend their
honeymoon in the Hawaiian Islands,
and will make their future abode ln

ALL POINTS TO BE
FAIRLY ADJUSTED
Excitement Over Samoa
Dying Out.
Coryrlghted, IKfÂ». by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, April 22.â The excitement
over the Samoan question has almost
died out, and the general expectation Is
that all the points at variance will now
be amicably and fairly adjusted by the
special commission.* Some of the lead
ing papers, in their desire for fairness,
even print communications from mem
bers of the British mission at Samoa,
controverting some of the statements
of Dr. Raffel, the German president of
the Municipal Council at Apia, regard
ing the relations of Tanu and Chief
Justice Chambers with the mission
aries. yy) yy
The Vossische Zeitung, referring to
the utterances of Dr. Lohr in present
ing the Samoan interpellation in the
Reichstag, said: "It clearly seems
there is a jinjo element in German pol
itics." 7 777
The . Alldeutsche Verband made a
weak demonstration by passing a reso
! lution to the effect that its members
| expected the Minister of Foreign Af
j fairs, Baron yon Bulow, to stick to his
[ declarations and see that "neither Ger
i many's treaty rights nor the national
I honor is in any way sacrificed at Sa
| moa."
The demonstration of the German-
Americans at- Chicago against the
American-British treaty or alliance is
discussed in the press, even the semi
official organs devoting considerable
space to the matter. In one of several
editorials the Post says: "The direc
tion of the American policy will not be
influenced thereby, even if a small mi
nority makes the conflict of their hearts
the subject of a political discussion. If
the Americans consider their interests
require an alliance with Great Britain,
they .would surely not be hindered
therein if the citizens of German ex
traction should put before \ their eyes

the dangers of war with Germany and
therefore appeal to their adopted coun
try not to put them in a situation where
they would he ohliÃed to fight their
fatherland. The result, so far as the
German - Americans are concerned,
would only be an intensification of the
bitter feeling belonging at the same
time to two countries, while the Amer
ican politician cynically looking down
upon this measure of patriotism, heart
and intellect reflects on "whether it
pays to catch the Dutch vote."
Another editorial in the Post says it
is hoped the movement of the German-

that the two countries ought to be and

DISSECTING THE
MURDOCK NOTE
Expert Eisenschimel Yet
on the Stand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, April 22.â Expert Eisen
schimel continued his testimony in the
Murdock note case this morning. He
took up the capital letter "M" in "Mur
dock," and with the aid of two rulers,
and by drawing a quadrant on the
blackboard, showed that the three long
strokes of the "M," if extended up
ward, would meet at a given point
above, while in the genuine signature
such would not be the case, the strokes
of the "M" being always parallel.
As the witness proceeds from one
branch of his work to another, he
hands to the jurors cards of enlarged
I photographs which have been prepared
Over Cafe Zinkand â Elevator.
for their information and convenience,
so as to enable them to follow him.
Eisenschimel next took up what he
called "sections" in the writing of the
name "Murdock, " showing that Wil
liam Murdock made from three to fiva
sections, while the writer of the signa
ture to the note made it in six sections.
Attorney Freeman at one time inti
mated that witness was intentionally
passing one of the photographic cards,
for the reason that the measurement
was not in accordance with the point
the expert was endeavoring to make.
The witness resented the insinuation.
General Barnes came to the rescue by
asking the court to put a stop to any
discussion between the counsel and
witness. His Honor stamped out the
little blaze with very small effort and
all was well again.
The defense has two more experts to
examine and then, it claims, It will
prove that William Murdock was at his
home all of the day on which the note
was alleged to have been signed at
Mrs. Murdock's house, twenty miles
distant. ;

THE GOS RATES QUESTION.
THE point raised by Mayor Phelan in connection
with the recent order fixing gas rates at $l io
per thousand feet, passed by the Board of Su
pervisors, is worthy ot more attention, it seems to us,
than lias yet been accorded to it. In any event some
body ought to undertake the work of carrying a case
to the Supreme Court in which it will be considered
ana decided, for the interests involved are sufficiently
important to justify the effort.
The Mayor claims that when the Board of.Super
visors adopted the order fixing gas' rates at $1 io its
action was final: that, in other words; under the
statute of IS7S, wherein the board finds its power,
there is no authority to rescind a rate once adopted
until one year has expired. Upon the point whether
or not the rate is reasonable the Mayor says the Su
pervisors are not compelled to allow the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company interest upon the
par value of its capital stock, but only upon the actual
value of its plant. As to whether the board is bound
to make an investigation and give the gas company
a hearing prior to fixing rates, Mr. Phelan does not
express an opinion.
The facts of the situation seem to contradict the
position taken by the gas company in this matter.
President Crockett says that the corporation cannot
afford to reduce its rates to $1 10 per thousand feet,
Yet it is a notorious fact that the Equitable Gas
Company is furnishing illumination at $1 per thou
sand. If the monopoly concern is insisting upon a
rate which will enable it to pay dividends upon a vast
amount of watered stock, of course its contentions
should not be considered. The gas consumers of
San Francisco are not to blame because the managers
of this corporation have for stock-jobbing purposes
overcapitalized their business. In the face of the
competition which is now confronting them they
should squeeze the water out of their stock and pre
pare to transact a legitimate business. No other con
clusion is logical in the premises.
We do not believe there is anything in Attorney
Bishop's contention that the act of 1878 is unconsti
tutional. It is true that that statute, which confers
upon the Board of Supervisors the power to regulate
the rates at which gas shall be supplied to consumers,
was "passed prior to the adoption of the present con
stitution. But there is nothing in the organic law
which forbids its enactment, and under the provision
that all laws not in conflict shall remain in force, it is
valid under the new constitution. Section 33 of ar
ticle IV, in fact, expressly authorizes the Legislature
to enact just such laws. The points at issue, however,
are very important and they should be settled
promptly.
INDUSTRIAL STOCKS.
WHILE the speakers at each and all of the Jef
ferson banquets found in the midst' of their
dissensions on all other subjects a point of
agreement in the denunciation of trusts, the promo
tion of such combinations for the control of the
great industries of the country goes briskly on, and
the so-called "industrial stocks" find no lack of in
vestors.
As has been pointed out by The Call, the investment
in such stocks has been largely of a speculative nature,
and the stronger financial journals of the East have
repeatedly warned the public to be careful in exam
ining the nature of the various companies that have
put shares upon the market. It is conceded, how
ever, that a considerable number of the new combina
tions arc sound, and that fact keeps the whole market
buoyant despite the danger of the situation.
It now appears, moreover, from a report in the
New York Tribune, that much of the opposition to
the boom in industrial stocks is due to persons who
have railroad shares for sale, and who therefore are
de. irons of turning the attention of investors from the
industrials to railroads. In the light of that revela
tion a new interest is given to the problem. It* is
possible the warnings against the industrial compa
nies may have been inspired by something other than
a pure desire to protect the public from error.
It is reported that ex-Governor Roswell P. Flower
was recently told by Picrpont Morgan that he must
strp supporting industrial stock, but it does not ap
pear from the report, as it comes to us, whether the
teliing was in the nature of advice or command. In
either case it was not heeded, for Mr. Flower has since
been quoted as giving a good "deal of encouragement
to the industrial movement. In a recent interview he
is reported to have said:
"I firmly believe that any concern organized for the
purpose of manufacturing any product of prime ne
cessity, that is undertaken with the view of cheapening
the cost to the consumer, must, in the nature of
things, be a success, provided, of course, that it is in
telligently and honestly administered." He went' on
to say, in effect, that these great enterprises are but
the modern tools of commerce that bear the same
relation to the smaller concerns that steam power
beats to the old processes of hand labor. â â _
Ex-Governor Flower is one of the most eminent
Democratic leaders in New York, In times past he
has been a prominent candidate for nomination
for the Presidency, and he still represents a strong
element in his party. It is therefore interesting to
note that he gives his commendation to the great in
dustrial trust movement at the very time when his
party seems bent upon making a fight against that
movement the chief issue of the campaign next year.
Clearly Mr. Flower will have to banquet by himself.
He is not fit to dine with either wing of the Jef
fersonians.
THE PfINHfINDLE EXTENSION.-
EVERYBODY has appreciated any improvement
that beautifies Golden Gate avenue as an ap
proach to the park. With all their tendency to
! differ about matters of public interest, the people of
i San Francisco have been cordially joined* in their
pride and pleasure in Golden Gate Park. The short
est road to the general good will of the masses has for
a long time been found in the donations of private
citizens for the adornment of the^park.
It is proposed now to acquire the property neces
sary to bring the .park boundary down to Van Ness
avenue by a.-panhandle extension that will make an
ample, parked and beautified entrance to the main
body of that great popular pleasure-ground.
As this will bring the park itself nearer to the peo
ple for whose use it is established and will in every
way dignify it and enhance the attractions of the city,
it is to be hoped that the proposition will meet with
popular favor.
Golden Gate Park is itself a monument to California
enterprise and initiative. Mayor McCoppin, who had
a prevision of the necessities of the city in the direc
tion of park and pleasure-ground facilities, was the
real promoter of the original reservation on the sand
hills which has now become one of the noted parks of
the world. But before it was developed very few
people believed that a park could be made on this
peninsula. When a professional opinion in the matter
was sought, Olmsted, whose reputation as the ar
chitect of Central Park in New York has since made
him a standard authority, gave as his judgment that
landscape treatment of the location of Golden Gate
Park was impossible. Recognizing the desirability of
an exit from the city to the ocean beach, he advised
that Van Ness avenue be excavated and curved to the
beach, so as to furnish a sunken driveway to the
ocean, and he believed that with such improvement
the city must be content, because the sands of the park
site were impossible of treatment to make them sustain
the * lawns and flora necessary. But the difficulties
then believed to be insurmountable have been over
come, and we have a park that all the year round is
the most attractive of any in the world, and the drive
from any of the entrances on the city side to the
ocean beach is through bosky foliage, velvet lawns,
flowers and shrubbery that would have charmed
Calypso.
The extension of all this as far as Van Ness avenue
will immeasurably enhance all the charms 6f the park
by enlarging their footing and will increase the en
joyment of them all by making them more accessible.
Older cities have paid heavily for delay in securing
land for parks and pleasure-grounds. Within a few
years New York, already in possession of Central
Park, Washington square and numerous * smaller
tracts, spent nearly twenty millions in securing park
land on the Bronx, north of Harlem River, and ex
tending nearly to King's bridge.
Every citizen sees now that it would have been
economy if long ago an ample tract as far downtown
as old St. John's Park or Gramcrcy square had been
reserved for park purposes, so that" there would have
been ample facilities for recreation and beautified
breathing spaces at intervals from Castle Garden to
Central Park. But the opportunity was passed by and
the Canal-street region on the west side and "tlie
swamp" were all overrun as business property, and
the city was driven into Westchester County as the
only possible place for further park extension.
It is not yet too late for San Francisco to econo
mize her opportunity to bring Golden Gate Park
down toward the center of population by this pan
handle extension. With this land acquired and
parked in harmony with the general plan, and Buena
Vista Park, already reserved, treated as its fine alti
tude and sightly slopes will permit, San Francisco
will have a park system that will forever outrival any
in the world and that will be a beauty and a joy
forever to all the generations of her people.
The Supervisors are inclined to take the initiative
in the matter, and in the collateral necessity for a
modern sewer system, and we are sure that the people
will sustain them in these enterprises whenever they
are called upon to pass judgment upon the propo
sition.
UNSUCCESSFUL GRf-IND LARCENY.
THE attempt of the rag-tag and bobtail of the
Democratic party to pose as the representatives
of the deep-seated opposition throughout the
1 United States to monopolistic exactions and
| corruptions' is actually farcical. At the cheap
! dinner in New York, which was paraded .as
j a contrast to the feast of the white-tied
i Democrats, O. 11. P. Belmont said: "We have
â  reached a point when -Democracy must rule or the
heirs of the greatest republic that we know of must
| bow their necks to the most powerful plutocracy the
world has ever known." This republic is the heir
of all the ages, but it is not yet dead, and, therefore,
Jias no heirs of its own. Taking Mr. Belmont's
words, however, as they were obviously meant, it
may be said that by striking out "Democracy" and
inserting "Americanism," this quotation will be con
verted into an expression of popular sentiment that
| deserves respect. Political manipulation in the
j United States is confined to no one party, but for
I many years has affected all parties. Historically the
; Democrats have been worse than the Republicans.
Whenever they were needed they have been used by
the different oligarchies of which "greed", is the
watchword. In this State the railroad lias never
failed to secure Democratic advocacy, and, as has
: been often stated, the domineering effort, with the
treacherous aid of the Examiner, to force Daniel
M. Burns into a Federal Senatorship was merely a
! preparatory step to the proposed transfer of Califor-
I nia to the Democracy in 1900.
The mass of Republicans throughout the Union
t greatly outweigh the Bryan Democracy in their an
tagonism to the extreme pretensions of monopoly
I because they are rooted in the American conception
i of self-government and equally object to imperialistic
I tendencies on the one hand and fo the socialism and
proletarianism of the Chicago platform on the other.
j They represent the sound constitutional Americanism,
through which and through which alone the integrity
I of the law can be maintained and the equality of its
administration secured.
The last and most dangerous expression of mon
opoly is imperialism, and essentially every expan
sionist is an imperialist. There are Democratic an
| nexationists by the thousand. There are Republican
I opponents of that revolutionary policy by the ten
! thousand. The most effective exposures and de
nunciations of the treasonable scheme to impress a
j British character upon this Government have come
from the Republican 'party.
Republicans can afford to laugh at the dinner cam
paign, in which it appears to be the peculiar office
of William J. Bryan to enact the role of a boss po
litical bully. Having beaten the Examiner-Journal
or Journal-Examiner into silence on its "national
policy," he and his newspaper ally are now engaged
in the congenial work of kicking the gold Democrats
out of the Democratic organization. Free silver at

is still the daughter upon which the defeated candi
date for the Presidency . harps. He also persists in
forcing the Chicago platform into the disgusted
American stomach, which spewed it up in the na
tional campaign of '1896 and in the State elections of
1898. This embalmed socialism and anarchy of the
tin-can Democracy was the alimony of Mr. Bryan's
party when it. was divorced from the genuine Democ
racy of the country, and in the campaign of 1900 may
reverse Shakespeare's order by furnishing a cold and
rotten feast for its funeral.
Mr. Bryan and the Examiner-Journal need have no
fear of 'the commission of bigamy by the sound
money Democrats. Their divorce is absolutely valid
and they retain all the valuable property of the Jef
fersonian Democracy. They will either remain in a
state of single blessedness or contract a new alliance
with the sound Republicans of the 'nation that will
be free from every meretricious element. American
ism is bound to be on top, and it will sit down pretty
hard on dangerous monopolists and imperialists and
on the demagogism of Mr. Bryan and his sup
porters.
THE MAN WITH fl SOUL.
THE tremendous compression of broad generali
zations in Edwin Markham's poem, "The Man
With a Hoe," stamps it as one of the most re
markable productions of modern times. The picture
by Millet, which gave Mr. Markham his inspiration,
is a grand conception, splendidly executed.
The picture and the poem represent a type of man
kind, bent and muscularly rigid, with a face brutal
ized by incessant labor and hardship, and fixed in a
stolid expression of hopeless imbecility in which the
faint stirring of rebellion against the oppression and
the fraud of ages can be detected. This terrible shape,
in which the light of intellect has been extinguished,
is presented as a portent and a menace to "the judges
of the world," and to the "masters, lords and rulers in
all lands."
As a work of art the picture resuscitates a dead past
and should, as it will, endure. The poem, however,
is a dangerous anachronism. It has no application
to the age in which we live. It is wholly pagan in its
scope. It is built upon a godless and a fatalistic as
sumption. It ignores the grand harmonies of human
development from. the age of Abraham to the birth of
Christ. It disregards the greater triumphs, the un
intermittent chorus of progressive mankind from the
dawn of the Christian era to the closing years of the
nineteenth century. It assumes isolated exceptions
to be the rule and reproduces failure wrapped in the
cerements of the grave as if its shrunken distortions
reproved the beauty, assailed the strength and shad
owed the exuberant hopefulness of modern civiliza
tion.
In the age of Cyrus or of, Xerxes imbruted pes
simism could have been typified by "The Man with
a Hoe." The hordes of Egypt and of India, the
Helots of Sparta, the black savages of Africa, might
have been .embraced within its range. But since the
blended forces of Hebrew theism and Christian fra
ternity began their prolonged struggle with the ever
diminishing barbarism of the world that type has
dwindled until now it is virtually extinct. The Saxon
sullenly wore but soon broke his collar and threw his
ponderous weight into the human march. The Nor
man struck the fetters from the limbs of Freedom and
entrenched it in a perpetual charter. The Celt allowed
no intermission in his upward struggle. The whole
Caucasian race has ascended the slopes of advance
ment and toils on toward its higher peaks. There
lias been no "silence of the centuries," and the
"dumb Terror" of antiquity has ceased its mute and
unheeded appeals.
When our Declaration of Independence was
promulgated and the sovereignty of man became the
endowment of a nation, the last physical or intellec
tual obstruction to human progress was removed.
The imperfections, the inaptitudes, the degrading
passions and appetites, the hard selfishness, of man
kind were still to be conquered, but opportunity, full,
complete, universal, came, and where opportunity is
open the "emptiness of ages" is a solecism and the
burden of the world has fallen like the load that Chris
tian bore to the celestial gates.
It is a marvel that "The Man With a Hoe" should
have been written at all â it is a greater marvel that it
should have been written in the United States it is
the greatest marvel of all that it should have been
written in California. This man belongs to a past
long interred. He exists nowhere on the globe, not
even among the peasantry of Russia, . the slavish
toilers of China or the fierce tribes of the Philippines.
Least of all is there any vestige of his existence in
America. Bad as conditions arc, low as the relative
depths of misery and poverty still remain, though
greed and false ambition yet infest even the citadels
of brotherhood, the uplifting of the race by the up
ward pressure of civilization has been .universal.
Food, shelter, comfort, education, mental stimula
tion, are even now unequally distributed. Extremes
of poverty and of wealth are visible even in our own
favored land. But the standards of life arc every
where raised far above the level of Mr. Markham's
conception, and. physically and intellectually, man
kind are comparatively as enlightened as they are
free.
"The man with a hoe" has long been dead. The
central question of this generation is moral and per
tains to the soul. While the human body has been
nourished and the human mind expanded, is morality
distanced, torpid or perishing? This is the text for
the great poet, the mighty interpreter of mystery, as
he views the signs and the portents that attend the
expiring throes of this century.
Charity sweetens the bitterest draughts of life. The
tender influences of love surround or touch every
phase of physical suffering and reach the craving of
the agitated mind. Optimistic gleams pierce the
deepest shadows that fall upon the pathway of the
unfortunate and the unsuccessful. But, in the midst
of unapproachable physical and mental advancement,
in the ordinary and not the exceptional or eccen
trical business of the world, where is the evidence of
corresponding moral improvement? Is the standard
even of the past maintained? These are interroga
tories that appeal not merely to individuals, but to
communities and to nations. They are suggested by
the occurrences and the revelations of each tumul
tuous day. They arise spontaneously from common
observation and experience. They include the multi
farious transactions of trade, commerce, finance and
government. They are illustrated through all lati
tudes and longitudes from the equator to the poles,
from Greenwich or Washington to the Philippines.
It is the man with the soul, the perfected citizen,
the nation governed by honor and by principle, that
the latent sublimities- are to arouse and to inspire
when priest or poet utters the intelligible word of
solicitation or of command. 'Sy.

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
Mrs. Gertrude Atherton is not alto
gether adorable, for she has recently
denied the authenticity of an interview,
and whosoever does that is fit for trea
sons, stratagems and spoils; but none
the less she is to be commended for the
frankness with which she has publicly
condemned the tone, the style, the man
ner, the matter and the method of the
criticism that prevails in California.
Even if her condemnation be madness
there is reason in it. As she herself is
reported to have said, British critics
have treated her work seriously and to
some extent sympathetically, and
therefore have been helpful to her;
while Californian critics, giving the
subject no earnest thought at all, have
either praised her books carelessly out
of conventional courtesy to a woman,
or have gibed and jeered at/them for
the purpose of showing wit. It must
be added that generally the criticisms
have been of the latter sort; for as the
opinion has prevailed among us that
wit is the chief qualification of a critic,
and mockery the finest element in wit,
nearly every man who has essayed
criticism has practiced to acquire a
style having in it as much of the
mocker as strong drink or a cocktail,
and most have been so successful that
satire and criticism have become well
nigh synonymous with us. Indeed, a
style that stings or bites or burns is
seemingly so much admired that even
politicians have taken it up as a popu
lar.thing. Our present misgovernor, for
example, announced in the flrst speech
of his campaign before the people that
he intended to speak "caustic verbi
age," and he has kept it up until sus
picion bas arisen that his tongue is
forked and has its root in a gall bag.
%'â <].* y-y.t "â¢; ;. â¢,"..';
That we have exaggerated the value
of satirical wit in the domain of criti
cism, given it a rank altogether out of
proportion to its worth, and carried it
too far in every direction is indisputa
ble. We have flouted nearly every
thing that has been done in the State
from the undertaking of a transconti
nental railroad to the writing of a
poem. Society, art, letters, politics and
oratory have all been sneered at with
an impartial injustice. Indeed, so far
have we carried our skill in that kind
of thing that at one time. our chief
critic was pictured in popular imagina
tion as an incarnate ferocity, wearing
a red shirt, carrying pistols in his
pocket, a dripping scalp in either hand,
a hatchet in his mouth, with his brow
bound by a bloody rag â a Jack the Rip
per of literature with a mania for man
gling female poets. We have talked
1 and written as if there were nothing
good in California but prunes and cli
mate; and, in short, made such noises,
that Eastern people, listening from the
distance, long since concluded there is
nothing on this side the Rockies but
jaybirds. .
* * *
What we need in California is an in
fusion of Boston culture--â that kind of
culture which men and women attain
when they have been taught from
youth upward to admire everything
done in their State, in their town and
in their set. Such culture is productive
of that satisfaction with the environ
ment and its people, which furnishes
about the surest basis for good man
ners and good morals the world affords.
Bostonianism is of course not exactly
perfection. A mutual admiration so*
ciety has always its ridiculous side;
but under any aspect, it is pleasanter
both to sight and to hearing than a dog
fight with forty terriers in the pit.
When the Massachusetts Legislature
meets, Boston treats it with as much
respect as if it were truly an assembly
of the virtuous and the wise; but when
the Legislature of California meets, w_
lampoon it, exaggerate every ridiculous
or offensive feature, exalt its fools and
ignore its abler men until by the car
ricaturing process it is made to appear
more like an outbreak of corruption in
the blood of the commonwealth than a
part of its healthful life. When grand
opera is given in Boston and Mrs. Jack
Gardner and the Beacon street and
Commonwealth avenue set go down in
rich array to listen, the social critics'
of the city neither gibe nor jeer, but
await the outcome with the calmness
of men who are assured that the opera
is to be put to its supreme test; that
Boston society is to revise the reviews
of Europe and rejudge its judgments
and pronounce final verdict upon the
performance.' But when grand opera
comes to San Francisco chatter- j
ing of the wits is as satirical as if our I
dames and .gentlemen of fortune had
never seen an opera gown nor heard
music before. When a man or woman
of Boston makes public a book or a
story, the work is discussed as if It
were a matter of historic and almost
religious importance, serious efforts are
made to discover the aims of the au
thor, to note the relations of the philos
ophy of the story to the problems ol :
life, and everything is done to impress
the world with the belief that some
thing new and great has been accom
plished. It is different here. The re
sult is that, by reason of her style of
criticising herself, Boston enjoys the
reputation of a city of the highest cul
ture and refinement, while our city isÂ»
spoken of as a "jay town" â and then
we wonder why.
â¢ â¢ *
Could the Boston method of self-ex
alting criticism be introduced here, it
would not be difficult to win for San
Francisco the reputation of the most
cultured city in America, We have at
present in California more talent and '
of a higher order than Massachusetts.
Ina Coolbrlth, Joaquin Miller and Ed
win Markham have written better po
etry than any other Americans now
living. Mrs. Atherton and Mr. Vachell
have written novels with more red
blooded, live humanity in them than
can be found in anything the East has
produced in a long time. Mr. Morrow
and Mr. Bierce are as far superior' to
the popular short story writers of the
other side of the Mississippi as the pro
found problems of life and mind with
which they deal are superior to the dia
lects of darky, Yankee and slumgul
lion which the Eastern populars are
forever trying to reproduce by distor
tions of spelling. Charlotte Perkins
Stetson has written the best satirical
verse of the time in our languageâ*
slight in quantity to be sure, not above
a dozen pieces or soâ but of a quality
"which as gentle as bright, never car
ried a heart stain away on Its blade."
â¢Â»/â **
Nor is it in literature only that we
excel. We have musical composers and
skilled, interpreters of music, artists
who have learned how to reproduce
upon canvas the splendor of the lights
and the purple deeps of. the shadows
that make up the marvelous richness
of our atmosphere. Boston boasts of
her architecture, but she has no mu
nicipal building with a facade so pic
turesque as that City Hall which we
have shut out from sight of our mall.
thoroughfares, and to which we close
our eyes as if it were a den of thieves.
We have, Ifurth< re, a commendable
group of millionaires, for they have
been munificent in giving as well as
magnificent in taking. Why pursue the
theme? We are in advance of Boston
in everything except the gentle art of
writing in such ;. way as to make the
world think we are criticising ourselves
when we are really sounding our trum
| pets to all the winds that blow and ex
alting our horn to the highest heaven.
* * *
Were it not for the seriousness of the
subject the announcement by Wash
-1 ington officials that General Law tun's
j expedition from Manila was intended
| not to suppress the insurgents and es
tablish order in the country, but mere
;ly to distribute broadcast the procla
mation of the Philippine Commission,
would be everywhere regarded as the
best contribution yet made to the hu
j mor of the day. No comic writer, could
i imagine anything funnier. The pro
found respect we have for our Govern
ment enables us to receive the state
ment with something of the gravity
with which it was uttered, and yet we
cannot but feel that our honored Presi
dent is moving toward the ridiculous.
His "benevolent assimilation" speech
at Boston was itself a hard trial to the
.gravity of a people who have a keener
j sense of humor than . any other or,
earth, and if our august chief execu
tive doesn't look out he will be known
as . a great American humorist before
long, and people will be hunting for
jokes in his messages to Congress.
â¢ * *
. â Whatever may be the fate which
awaits us under the new charter, *we
can find consolation in the assurance it
(cannot give us anything worse in the
| way of a Police Commission than we
have been suffering under for some
! time. "When our municipal government
was exposed to contact with the mag
netic Markham by reason of his official
position as Governor of the State, it
had the misfortune to catch Mose
Gunst from him, and the thing seems
something like the seven years' itch, for
it stays' with us and keeps us scratch
ing in continual irritation. To make a
police or any other kind of commis
sioner out of such a Gunst was to in
flict upon us the worst ever imposed
upon an American commonwealth.
. Burns in the .Senate would have been
bad, but the national capital is distant
and Congress adjourns occasionally, so
we should have had respites; but Gunst
is local. To get rid of him it was neces
â¢ sary either to burn the town or adopt
a new charter, and we have chosen
what seems to be the least expensive
of the two remedies. When we begin
a new era under the new charter the
happiest shout of. -the time will be:
"Mose Gunst has went!"
_ * â¢
Eastern femininity has been as con
spicuous during the past- week as the
Easter bonnet, but not altogether so
lovely. Mrs. Lease has announced a
determination "to make money cheaper
than men in this country," and Mrs. Sen
ator Frye has tried to make that emi
nent man. Dr. Jordan of Stanford, feel
cheaper than any money known to our
currency. Concerning the Lease prop
osition, little can be said at this time,
as we cannot estimate the degree of
cheapness she proposes to introduce
into our monetary system until we
know exactly what valuation she puts
upon men. Mrs. Frye, however, is
clearly open to discussion. In accusing
Dr. Jordan of talking of things of
which he was ignorant, she wrote of
things of which she herself was igno
rant; and in putting her tongue into
politics has put her foot in it also. The
doctor's reply was neat, and while
Mrs. Frye is entitled to the last word
she would do better to take a second
thought than to take advantage of the
privilege.
â¢ * â¢
The proposal to bond the city for the
purpose of providing funds for the ex
tension of the "panhandle" to Van Ness
avenue is doubly commendable, inas
much as the plan if carried out will
not only open a spacious and beautiful
way to the park, but will establish a
precedent which will open a way for
the improvement of the whole city. We
condemn our city officials from one
generation of them to another, because
San Francisco is neither so well paved,
so well sewered nor so well kept In its
public places in any respect as are the
large. cities of the East. Bad as they
may be, however, the officials of the
city are not wholly to blame for its
Silurian condition. They may be plain
hogs, but they are not the swine into
whose bodies went to the devils whose
name was legion. I have no doubt they
would gladly improve the city if they
j had the money and the lack of money
is no fault of theirs, for they put taxes
las high as the traffic, will bear. The
obstacle in the way of progress is that
we have followed. the methods of the
dark ages and done patchwork im-
I provements as we- could pay for them
out of annual revenues, instead of doing
'what is done in every enlightened city
in the world, and borrowed sums suf
ficient to make improvements on a
comprehensive scale. Permanent bet
terments of any kind will be enjoyed
by future generations, and the pay
ment for them, therefore, may be justly
extended over a considerable period.
By taxation we take money from busi
ness where it is earning anywhere from
10 to 20 per cent, while by borrowing
we could get it for less than 4 per cent.
Finally, by the pay as you go process,
we have to wait years for improve
| ments that are needed now, while by
bonding the city we might have them
at once. Nearly all municipal work
when well done. is economy in the true
] sense of the word, and by promptly im
proving the city we would accomplish
such a saving in â â wear, and tear as
would amount to more than the cost
long before the bonds fall due. The
"panhandle" proposition is clearly a
handle to pan-San Franciscan prog
ress. ______________________

IAN MACLAREN AS
AN EXPANSIONIST
We sat at one of the little tables in
the Palace courtyard, and lan Mac
laren's usual fluency of conversation
was marred by just a trifle of languor.
This was only to be. expected, for he
had been wrestling nearly a couple of
hours with the pathetic story of Dr.
William McClure's life, reading his own
creation with such an intensity of ex
pression that none in the audience
were ashamed to weep.
"California audiences? Yes, I have
invariably found them cultured and ap
preciative. l have traveled through
the whole southern portion of the
State, and everywhere I have met with
the same subdued yet graceful recep
tion." . . â¢ Â â¢ â  .
With a generosity worthy of a broad
minded minister of the Gospel, to
whom creed is little more than an
empty-sounding word, lan Maclaren
thus heaps coals of fire on California's
unfortunate head. For, to put it mild
ly, the people of the Golden State have
not shown the proper amount of en
thusiasm over this gifted exponent of
the kailyard school. Every one who
reads at all has laughed and wept over
his pathetic or humorous pictures of
Scottish peasant life. Kate Carnegie
and Dr. McClure, Jemmy Soutar and
"Postle" are living characters wher
ever the English tongue is heard. Yet
somehow the fame of his books did not
induce people to attend lan Maelaren's
lectures in sufficiently remunerative
numbers. One glance at the scowl
which adorns Major Pond's bushy eye
brows is sufficient to prove this fact.
"What are you about here in Cali
fornia, anyway?" asks the Major. "It
will be a long time before you catch me
on this coast again:" As Major Pond's
ample shoulders bear the financial bur
den of the transaction, his annoyance
is quite excusable. *7 -
But lan Maclaren has nothing but
good words for us, for our climate, our
scenery, our capacity for infinite devel
opment. "Your cities are beautiful," he
said. "Look at San Francisco, with its
unsurpassed situation. Your Mayor
has kindly shown me all over the town,
and, in passing, let me pay a slight
tribute to Mr. Phelan. i I consider him
to be the ablest Mayor I have met in
America. In all my travels through
this country I have never come across
a man who showed such an unselfish
spirit of civic patriotism and devotion
to the municipal idea. It surprises me
that a person of suoh wealth and so
cial position should give himself up so
completely to the thankless task of
serving his fellow- citizens.
"Your city, under good government,
has unlimited opportunities for expan
sion. And what a magnificent vista for
trade is "opening up before you in the
East! San Francisco should become
the emporium for the whole commerce
of the Pacific."
"But do you believe that the policy
of territorial aggrandizement, inaug
urated by the late war, is a wise one
for the United States to adopt?"
"That is a question which the peo
ple of the commonwealth must settle
for themselves. But as a Briton I am,
of course, an imperialist, and believe
that the true policy of a great nation
is to extend its foreign trade by every
legitimate means. And there is no bet
ter method than the establishment of
wealthy and prosperous colonies."
"But do you think we are justified in
holding the Philippines permanently?"
"Oh, that is a mere debating society
question. The thing Is a fait accompli,
and whatever happens the United
States cannot retire. She has made
herself responsible to the nations of
the ! world for the establishment of a
stable government in these isles; she
must maintain law and order at any
cost. 'Your country. has taken tip what
Kipling has so happily styled the
white man's burden, and she can
never lay it down. In my opinion not
only the Philippines, but also Cuba and
Porto Rico, should be governed as are
our crown colonies. It is a great mis
take to grant independence to the Cu
bans, to set so-called generals like
Gomez in posts of power. It is simply
aiding them to misrule the people,
to repeat in the future all the corrup
tion and cruelty which have character
ized Spanish administration in the
past.
"Why should a great free nation like
the United States do this thing. She
has everything to lose and nothing to
.gain by following such a course. A
free Cuba will prove a constant trouble
and annoyance, a potential source of
war. Revolution will follow revolution,
for the Cubans are not strong enough
for self-government, and each time the
United States will be expected to step
in restore order.
"The cost will be enormous, and the
commercial development of the island
will be seriously checked. The same
remarks apply to Porto Rico and the
Philippines. The United States must,
in her own Interests, adopt a firm co
lonial policy, based on the principles
which govern England's administration
of her crown colonies. And see what
you will gain by following this course.
It is not merely a question of trade,
though that is important enough. It
is the vital part which the government
of colonies plays in the development of
a nation's higher faculties.
"The establishment of a highly or
ganized, highly, paid and thoroughly
competent colonial civil service would
provide an invaluable outlet for your
college, graduates, men of culture and
breeding; who at present have no'
sphere for the proper exercise of their
talents. All the home professions art
overcrowded, but the prospect of hon
orable- service in the nation's cause
would attract the best and brightest in
the land. Of course, I assume that
such a service would be entirely inde
pendent of political Influence, and that,
by means of a severe competitive ex
amination, only the attest, both physi
cally and mentally, would be selected
for the work. And to Insure honest ad
ministration, the men must be well
paid. This is what England has been
doing in India, and. in fact, all over
the world, for the past century. She
has sent the pick of her youth to serve
their country as colonial administra
tors, and the result, as you know, has
been unqualified success.
"Think what an addition this civil
i service would be to the resources* of the
nation. Think of the effect it would
ultimately have on the home adminis
tration. AS soon as the people of this
country recognized that it was possi
ble to secure honest and capable ad
ministrators for the colonies, they
would be satisfied with nothing worse
for their own use. American politics
would be purified, the office-seeker and
the boss would be eliminated from na
tional life, and the ideal free Govern
ment aimed at by the founders of the
republic would be realized."
"It sounds pretty. Dr. Watson." I
said, "but how about the accomplish
ment
Unfortunately. Dr. Watson was no
longer the preacher, the shrewd, much
t raveled man of the 4 world. The ap
pearance of Major Pond had suddenly
converted him into lan Maclaren. the
popular lecturer and writer of kailyard
stories. An impatient audience awaited
him across the bay. and there was no
time to go into details. "All you have
to do." he said. -as he waved a fare
well, "is to work out your policy of
colonial expansion on the lines I have
suggested, and the nation will never,
regret the experiment." .â *

peared in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
morning. He was instructed and ar
raigned by the Judge and was quite ra
tional in his answers to questions. The
case was continued until April 28 to await
the result of the old man's wounds.
The old man was partly conscious yes
terday, but had no realization of what
had happened him. His mind seemed
blank on that point. Owing to his age the
chances of his recovery are doubtful. He
was removed to the City and County Hos
pital yesterday afternoon.
It appears that Donovan borrowed the

penter work. Donovan had ground the
edge down, making it almost as sharp as
a- razor. If the blows bad been struck
with the sharp edge of the ,-.x the old
I man's skull would have been split open.
Joseph J. Jardlne, the old man's son,
thinks that Donovan is more vicious than
I crazy. He had no reason in the world to
attack his father. Donovan was a heavy
drinker of claret, but as there had been
special mission services in the church for
the past two weeks he had suddenly
stopped drinking, and that might have
made him crazy.
Recently Donovan threatened to shoot
George Lame, a tenor in the choir, as he
imagined that Dame wanted to get him
out of the choir. Lame complained to a
policeman and Donovan was searched,
but no weapon was found upon him. He
also threatened to shoot a bartender in
'â¢ a saloon at Fourth and Brannan streets,
who is now in Fresno.
Three or four years ago Donovan was
arrested by Policeman Mullin for carry
ing a concealed weapon. He had a double
barreled' derringer in his ' pocket. _ynce
then he has always threatened to get
even with Muljin. He has - a brother,
Maurice Donovan, a carpenter, in Berke

Unless he acts more like a crazy man
than he does at present there is little
chance, of him being sent before the In

REVOLTING DEED OF
CRAZY MRS. BUTTNER
MRS. CHRISTINE BUTTNER,
rendered desperate by real or
fancied wrongs, committed sui
cide yesterday in a most re
volting manner, cutting her throat
from ear to ear with a large carving
knife.
The unfortunate woman was a
widow, 4S years old, and was living
with her stepdaughter at 2041 Taylor
street. The stepdaughter, who is
very hard of hearing, was engaged
about her household duties in the
dining room shortly before 1 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, when her atten
tion was attracted by the concussion
and jar of a heavy body falling.
Suspecting something terrible, be
cause her stepmother had been de
spondent and had exhibited symp
toms of insanity for the past two
years, she hastened to her mother's
bedroom and saw the body of Mrs.
Buttner lying on the floor in a pool
of blood, with the carving-knife
grasped in her right hand. The sui
cide had partly disrobed, and stood
between the foot of the bed and the
bureau, facing the mirror. After
committing the fearful deed she fell
to the floor and expired immediately
from the profuse hemorrhage.
On the bureau was found a letter
written in German by the deceased
and addressed to Undertaker Maas.
The following is a translation fur

TEN INNINGS
AND DISASTER
FOR OAKLAND
Santa Cruz Wins a
Hot Contest.
BEST GAME OF THE SEASON
REMARKABLE FIELDING BY
BOTH TEAMS.
Donlin Proves to Ec a Master of
the Art of PitchingâRus
sell Makes a Great
Showing.
. In a game that required an extra round
to give a decision and kept the usual Sat
urday crowd of cranks in a fever of ex
citement from the time the first ball was
pitched until a sensational double play put
an end to further hostilities, the Colts
succumbed to the Lobsters by a score of
3 to 2.
There will be more extra-inning games
played at Recreation Park this season,
for the teams are evenly matched and
playing the best ball ever witnessed in
California; but it is "a cinch" that a pret
tier contest will never be handed out to a
local crowd than that of yesterday.
All the teams in the league have now
been seen here, and it must- be admitted
that Santa Cruz has made" the most fa
vorable impression. The men are all big,
strapping fellows, who handle themselves
in an ideal manner, are heavy sluggers,
and above all have at least one pitcher
who is the peer of any twirler in the
league. Donlin is the next candidate for
Eastern honors, and there is no company
in the National League that is too fast
for him. He draws the cork with his left
hand, has amazing curves, great speed
and absolute control of the bail. His only
fauLt is his great deliberation in cutting
loose. It is exasperating to see him stand
in the box apparently buried in thought
when he should be busy, for he wastes
fully fifteen minutes during a game in
communing with himself. But in- is young
yet, and will learn better, in the course
of time. Yesterday Donlin made the Oak
land wing shots look like bogus beer
checks. He struck out eleven men, gave
only two bases on balls and was only
touched up for five singles, no two of
which came in the same inning. One of
these, Schmeer's drive in the tenth, was
of the scratchiest kind, and it was a ques
tion whether to give Schmeer a hit or
Devereaux an error. It was a terrific
grounder, which . struck Devereaux's
hands and got away before he could close
on It. Such work as Donlin's will win
games anywhere, particularly when
backed up by such almost faultless sup
port as he received yesterday. The won
der is that Oakland scored at all.
Ewing is still having hard luck with his
team. Donovan continues to ride his
Charley horse, and Dunleavy has not yet
recovered from his sprained ankle. In
consequence Ewing, after releasing Bor
land on Monday, had to hire him over
again for this series, placing him in cen
ter field. Twice yesterday the young man
had a golden opportunity to bat in a run
and gain favor with his employer, but
he struck out instead, y

hand, which he split two weeks ago. has
not healed, but is covered with court
plaster. It is exceedingly -painful yet,
and three halls got past him owing to his
inability to receive them properly. It
will be another week at least before Oak
land's hospital squad will be fit for ser
vice.
Fred Lange made the star play of the
day, a one-hand catch of a smoking
liner over third by Williams. in the sev
enth inning. Schmeer, however, won
nearly as great a round of applause in
the sixth, when he made a running pick
up of Burge's grounder, at deep short,
fielding the runner out at first after a
quick recovery.
In the. tenth Williams got a put out
and assist on a double play that set
tled Oakland's hopes of capturing the
game.. After Croll had struck out
Schmeer made his scratch hit. Lange
followed with a hot grounder to Wil
liams, who made a pretty scoop, ran to
second and pinched Schmeer and then
i threw Lang* out at first.
Of the eight hits Santa Cruz made off
Russell. who was not far behind Donlin
in effectiveness, in only one inning was
I there any bunching. In the sixth the
I first three men up ripped off singles and
it looked like all day for Oakland. But
Santa Cruz failed to tally in that inning,
which fact, when it is further stated that
a base on balls and a passed ball also
favored the Lobsters, shows the quality
of fielding Oakland was dishing out.
i Williams, for Santa Cruz, scored in the
first inning on a base on balls. Donlin's
sacrifice and. Pace's single. Oakland fol
lowed suit, when with one out Schmeer
was given a pass, stole second and scored
on Lange's single.
Santa Cruz took another in the fourth.
Pace getting his base on balls, advancing
to second on Clark's sacrifice and com
pleting the circui when Streib drove out
a single.
From that time on until the ninth there
was a lull in the run-getting, but not in
critical plays. Then, when the people were
getting ready to go home, the Colts tied
the score. Hardle was safe on Arellanes'
â¢ excusable error, was sacrificed to second
by Lee Hammond and galloped home on
Moskiman's nice single.
Then the crowd sat down again to
watch further developments. They came
in the tenth, for with one out Streib
: singled, stole . second, reached third on
Schmeer's fumble of Arellanes' grounder
and tallied on Moskiman's error of
Schmeer's throw after the shortstop got
j the ball. Oakland could not tie the game
| up again and the score was as follows:

To-Day's Game at Oakland.
Manager J. Cal Ewing will throw open |
his new baseball park to the Oakland [
cranks this morning, when his team of I
colts and selling platers will again face j
the crustaceans from Monterey Bay. j
Baseball fever is epidemic across the bay
now, and the patients are enraptured
with their' team, so the Sunday morning ,
games will bring out large crowds. More- !
over, the trip across the bay will prove
delightful to San Francisco fans, who can ;
take in the morning game, return with the j
players and witness the afternoon games I
at Recreation Park. The new grounds
are located at Golden Gate, the flrst sta
tion beyond the racetrack. Game will be
called at 10 o'clock sharp, and visitors
from this side will have to take the 9
o'clock boat. â¢ Following is the line-up for j
the morning game:

AN EASY VICTORY.
Polytechnic High School Defeats the
Mount Tamaipais Military
. Academy Team.
The Polytechnic High School of San
Francisco added another game to its al- !
ready long list of victories by defeating
the Mount Tamaipais/ Military Academy
at the Folsom street park yesterday after
noon by the one-sided :>core of 16 to 7. The
local boys completely outclassed their op
ponents, and from . the start there was
never any doubt that they would win.
The soldier boys were lighter as a whole
and showed themselves to be sadly lack
ing in team work. Hatch's delivery
proved easy of solution, and the Poly
technic batters took kindly to his curves.
The score might have been closer but for
the fact that Hatch was miserably sup
ported in the field, the infield especially
being guilty of ragged work. After se
curing a safe lead the Polytechnic players
let up a little and allowed their opponents
to have a few runs for consolation.
The two teams were as follows:.
Polytechnicâ Jacobs, pitcher; E. Gage,
center field; McCarthy, third base; Gage,
catcher; Morgan, shortstop; Sanborn, first
base; Levy, second base; Clough, left
field; Collins, right field.
Mount Tamaipaisâ first base;
Barr, shortstop; Carbaley, left field: Cof
fin, center field; Curtis, catcher; Hatch,
pitcher; Hill, second base; Minor, right
field; Hanson, third base.

CAPTAIN COGHLAN PLIES
THE LASH ON GERMANS
IN SPEECH AND SONG
NEW YORK, April 22.â Captain
Joseph B. Coghlan â¢*â¢'''â¢ the offi
cers of the United States cruiser
Raleigh were the guests of
honor at n reception at the
Army and Navy Club to-night.
Captain Coghlan. replying to an ad
dross of welcome, aid:
"We have received a warm welcome
here to-night, but we received a warm
er reception when we arrived at Ma
nila. In fact, the Spaniards were so
warm In their reception that they
wanted to keep us there for good. I
find that what I Lid last night at the
Union League Club has caused great
umbrage to be taken In Washington.
This has been caused by newspaper re
ports of what I said which were not
entirely correct. Some of the reports
were garbled. 1 will not say I was in
correctly reported, but the meaning
wa.s twisted a little. What I said was
true, however, and I will repeat it if
necessary. I said what I did about a
certain power because we felt it out
thero at "Manila.
"We were -ing nagged to death.
They were nagging us, damn them.
It might have brought war. We were
ready for it. We had enough of it. I
have' read a good deal in the newspa
pers out what occurred at Manila,
and not one of them has placed our
gallant Admiral George Dewey in a
proper light. We felt the nagging that
was going on constantly. That is the
reason I thought we should place the
Admiral in a proper light.
â¢'You nil understand that the whole
of us were a long way from home. All
shared grand old Admiral Dewey's
anxiety nd felt the responsibility that
he and we were under. We felt we
were being belittled In Manila and we
felt the nagging keenly. The Admiral
â was a man who could stand it. and
kept up a long time when all of us were
â¢irritated almost to impatience. You
can be irritated by a man until you
want to kill him. Well, when the mo
ment came he stopped them and they
never moved another hair. 1 did think
nnd always will think that we were
that close (snapping his fingers) to
â killing them. No man in the whole
country was more able or more ready
to uphold the honor of our people than
â¢grand old Admiral Dewey."
Captain Coghlan was here interrupt
ed by such vociferous applause that he
could not continue his speech for a few
moments.
"He is a James Dandy,'* he contin
ued. "I could go on all night and re
peat what I have said, but one does not
vant to get a reputation of a one
speech man. I will say that no matter
â what occasion or what difficulty con
fronted him. Admiral Dewey ways
rose superior to the occasion. Ho never
made a mistake ln his work there We
nt home may make mistakes in telling
about it. but ho made none at Manila.
110 told the Spaniards at Manila thai
if they fired a gun after May 1 he would
wipo them off the face of the earth, and
after that they never pulled a trigger."
When Captain Coghlan finished
speaking the cheering was so loud that
it might have boon heard in Broadway,
more than half a block away.

that he was of the opinion the matter
was one which should be attended to by
the roper department of the Govern
ment.
The story told by Captain Coghlan ia
somewhat different from that which has
reached the Navy Department. An offlcer
on duty at the department told me he
understood that when the aid to the Ger
man commander in chief brought to the
attention of the admiral the bringing in
of supplies to foreign residents the Ameri
can command* said he had winked at
the practice while he did not officially
know of It, because _e*did no! desire to
impose extraordinary hardships on for
eign residents in Manila, but now that
the matter was brought to his attention
officially by the German admiral the prac
tice must Immediately stop. The depart
ment's reports do not show that the ad
miral made any reference to the cheap
ness of the German Hag, while Captain
Coghlan declared last night the admiral '
asserted they could be -'tight for half a
dollar a yard anywhere.
Navy official sincerely regret the neces
sity of bringing Captain Coghlan's atten
tion to the remarks attributed to him
by the press and they earnestly hope he
can inform the department he was incor
rectly quoted.
At a dinner given him at the Union
League Club in New York last night Cap
tain Coghlan is reported to have told the
story of the Incident of Dewey and the
German admiral as follows:
â¢Hiring those .lays, after the great fight was
over, he (Dewey) Buffered the most outrageous
nagging. On, on it went, day after day. rub
bing clean through the flesh to the bone, but he
always held himself and others up. I tell you
it was magnificent. I must tell you of an inci
dent which. I think, will -be of interest. Ad
miral yon Diederichs sent an officer to complain
of the restrictions placed upon him by Admiral
Dewey. I happened to be near by at the time,
and I overheard the latter part of the conver
sation between their offlcer and our chief. I
shall never forget it. and I want the people of
the United States to know what Admiral
Dewey said that day.
'â¢Tell your admiral." he said, "that his ships
must stop where I say." "Hut we fly a flag,"
said the officer. "Those flags can be bought at
half a dollar a yard anywhere," said the ad
miral, and there wasn't a bit of fun in his face
when he said it. either. "Any one can fly
that," he continued. "The whole Spanish fleet
might come on us with those colors lf they
wanted to. Therefore, I must and will stop ;
you. Tell your admiral I am blockading here.
I am tired of the character of his conduct. I've
made it as lenient as possible for him. Now
the time has arrived when he must stop. Listen
to me. Teil your admiral that the slightest
Infraction of these orders by himself or his
officers will mean but one thing. Tell him
what I say. It will mean war. Make no mis
take when I pay that it will mean war. If your
people are ready for war with the United States
you can have It in five minutes."
I am free to admit that the admiral's speech
to that officer took my breath away. As the
offlcer left to go back to his ship he said to
an American officer, whose name I can't recall,
"I think your admiral does not exactly under
stand." "Oh. yes. he does." said the American
offlcer. "He net only understands, but his
means every word he says."
COGHLAN ORDERED TO
SEA BY SECRETARY LONG
NEW YORK. April 22.â Captain Cogh
lan of the cruiser Raleigh was suddenly
Ordered to sea by Secretary Long late to
night. The captain was entertained at a
di-nner at the Army and Navy Club, and
was expected to finish the evening at
the Montauk Club in Brooklyn, where a
reception was being given Senator-elect
Chauncey M. Dep in honor of his birth
day. Just as Mr. Depew had finished his
speech a telegram from Captain Coghlan
was read, in winch he announced he
would reach the Montauk Club in twenty

This was hardly read by the secretary
of the Montauk Club when another' tele

hands. This announced that he (the cap
tain) was sorry to have to disappoint the
Montauk Club, but that since dispatch
ing the previous telegram ho had received
orders from Secretary Long to proceed at

No explanation for this sudden move on
the part of the (department regarding

AN INTERNATIONAL
TRUST IN COPPER
All the Big Mines in
America Combined.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 22.â The Times-Her
ald will say to-morrow: Definite in
formation reached Chicago to-day that
the contracts had been signed in Lon
don Friday which formally transferred
to a single organization practically all
of the large copper producing mines in
the United States. The details were
meager and came through the brokers
who had handled minor parts of the
deal In this city.
It Is understood that the mines under
contract produced about 425,000,000
pounds fine of the total output of 583,
--000,000 pounds fine that were mined in
this country last year. The same mines,
it is claimed, will produce fully 475,000,
--000 pounds fine of the output of the 600,
--000,000 pounds fine estimated for 1899.
According to the estimate made di-"*
rectly after the negotiations for the big j
producers became public property, the j
actual value of 'the mining properties |
taken over will exceed $400,000,000. The j
particulars, however, will probably be
made public during the coming week
and the formal life of the company will
date from May 1.
In effect, the 'new organization is an
international trust in copper. The or
ganization will protect the price both in
Europe and America and give to the j
company power to distribute the out
put intelligently and economically to
the market where it is most in demand.
It was the latter consideration which
brought into the combination some of
the interests that were previously an
tagonistic. The Rothschilds furnished I
the funds and made the stipulations for |
the European interests involved, while ;
the Standard Oil Company was credited
with acting in the same capacity for
the American side. The Rothschild in- <
terest had its main leverage in its hold- j
ings on Isle Royal, in Lake Superior, j
known as the Wendigo Copper Com- j
pany, the stock of which concern is j
not listed on any American exchange, |
and the Isle Royal Land Company \
(limited).
Among the other properties named in .
yesterday's private cables were, the]
Clark-Bigelow and the Marcus Daly in
terests in Montana; the Arcadian and |
Centennial in the Lake Superior region,
and the Old Dominion in Arizona, but
it is known thai several other heavy
producers not named are included.

STOPPING SPREAD
OF DISAFFECTION
AMONG VOLUNTEERS
General Otis Is Now Censoring
Cablegrams Sent to Soldiers
in the Philippines.
NEW YORK, April 22.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: General Otis is making a
determined effort to prevent the
spread of disaffection among the volun
teers under his command by censoring
dispatches sent to them by political
opponents of the administration in the
United States.
The President has received a cable
gram from that officer informing him
of the action he has taken and stating
that the seditious messages being sent
are responsible for the change in the
feeling among the troops who desire to
be returned immediately to the United
States.
It was denied by Secretaries Alger
and Long to-day that \ the matter was
made the subject of Cabinet discussion
.yesterday, but it is known that the
President has discussed the dispatch of
General Otis with his Cabinet advisers
with a view to determining the action
which ought to be taken. There seems
to be no doubt in the administration's
mind that it is within the power of
the President to direct Judicial action.
He will not do so, however, but will
let the matter rest in General Otis'
hands, who will continue to exercise
the censorship he has established and
thus prevent dispatches sent from this
country reaching those for whom they
are intended.
Dispatches which General Otis has
suppressed declare, I understand, that
the volunteers have completed their
term of office under the army reorgani
zation law and are entitled to imme
diate return home. The effect of this
agitation, it is said, is that volunteers
who six weeks ago announced that
they were desirous of remaining in the
Philippines until the insurrection was
quelled now insist upon being imme
diately transported home.
It is also asserted that as a result of
the circulation of the dispatches among
volunteers few will take advantage of.
that provision of the army reorganiza
tion law under which .the Government
was authorized to re-enlist them for a
period of six months after the procla
mation of the President announcing
the exchange of ratifications of the
treaty of peace with Spain.
TREASON REVEALED IN
SEDITIOUS CABLEGRAMS
.CHICAGO, April 22.â A Washington
special to the Inter Ocean says: Notwith
standing the denial of the Associated
Press concerning the sending of seditious
cablegrams to Manila, the statement
published in the Inter Ocean this
morning is repeated on tne highest pos
sible authority. Several .days ago Gen
eral Otis cabled direct to President Mc-
Kinley that he had in his possession a
number of cablegrams to officers of vol
unteers which were treasonable and se
ditious. He repeated those cablegrams to
the President and they were laid before
the Cabinet yesterday. They were dis
cussed, but no conclusion was reached as
to what should be done regarding the
men who have been engaged in the con
spiracy.
The administration has known for some
time that letters were sent to volunteers
in the Philippines urging-them to demand
their discharge. Some of the volunteers
have revealed this to their officers. But
since the exchange of ratifications of the
peace treaty the anti-expansionists have
sought to use the cable to urge volun
teers to refuse longer service. General
Otis has absolute control of the cable,
and he has taken possession of cable
grams and reported .item to the Presi
dent. He is the Judge as to what mes
sages shall be sent and received at Ma
nila, and he has withhold these messages
from the men for whom they were in
tended.
It is known also that other cablegrams
have been sent to Hongkong to be deliv
ered and that they urged the volunteers
to refuse further service in the army
and demand Immediate discharge. .Such
messages are. regarded as clearly sedi
tious, because the Philippines are now
United States territory and the insurgents
there are in rebellion against this Gov
ernment.
They are not fighting for any right they

GENERAL LAWTON PUTS
FILIPINOS TO FLIGHT
MANILA, April 22.-7 p. m.â General
Lawton took the field at daybreak to
day with a column of troops consisting
of the North Dakota Regiment, two bat
talions of the Third Infantry, the
Twenty-second Infantry, two guns, of
Scott's" battery, three troops of the
Fourth Cavalry and Gales' squadron,
equipped in light marching order. This
force started at 5 o'clock this morning
over the Novalich road, traversing the
country previously cleared of rebels,, but
subsequently reoccuplcd by them. It is
to be presumed that General Lawton by
this movement will outflank the enemy
before joining General Mac Arthur north
of Novalich.
The Dakota regiment first encountered
the enemy in front of Novalich at* 8
a. m. The rebels opened fire on our
troops, but their flre was silenced fifteen
minutes later, the enemy retiring in bad
order and the Americans advancing along
the rough roads around Novalich. They
were considerably annoyed by the fire
of the rebel sharpshooters from the jun
gle for two hours. At 2 o'clock in the
afternoon the rebels were in full flight,
leaving many dead on the field and our
troops were compelled to take a brief
rest in the shade, the heat was so over
powering.
MANILA, April 23. 11:20 a. Colonel
Remie and Major Lasseras. the Spanish
commissioners, with their secretaries, at
tempted to enter the rebel lines yesterday
to confer with Aguinaldo regarding an ex
change of prisoners, but failed in their
mission. The party, the members of
which were attired in full uniform, drove
to the American camp and lunched with
General Mac Arthur. They then proceed
ed in a carriage, under a flag of truce
toward Calumplt, but were stopped by the
rebel outposts on the road who assumed
a menacing attitude and refused to par
ley with the commissioners, and the latter
were compelled to return and took the
evening train for Manila.
The rebels before Calumplt have re
cently been reinforced by men from the
Pampanga Province and are now well in
trenched in the strongest position on what
is practically an island formed by a trib
utary of the Rio Grande. â¢

AMERICANS TOO VAIN
AND TOO RESOLUTE
British Journals Declare That Uncle
Sam Must Not Give Up the
Philippines.
righted, 1*599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, April 22.â The news from the
Philippine Islands of the retirement of
General I.awton from the Santa Cruz dis
trict and the capture of the boat's crew
of the Yorktown has made a considera
ble impression here, and the comments
of the press all reflect anxiety lest the
unfavorable news should have a discour- i
aging effect upon America's expansion
views.
Prominence is given to dispatches from \
America, apparently indicating a cooling |
of public opinion regarding the Philip
pines, and the general tenor of the British
press deprecates this seeming tendency
to gloominess, pointing out that upon In
numerable occasions British arms have
met with a check, only to eventually con
quer all obstacles.
"We were discouraged after Isandula,"
remarks one paper, "but we are beyond
the Zambesi all the same."
Discussing General Lawton's retirement,
the Speaker says: "The movement ap- j
pears, on reflection, natural, as any other
course would be folly. The American i
campaign up to now is justified by causes.
The real significance, of the apparent '
check is to be looked for in America it
self. There is little doubt that when the
Presidential contest occurs the adminis- ;
tration will not have to reckon with a !
disorganized and discredited foe. The !
cost and sufferings of the troops will help
the Democratic reaction and the repa
triated troops are not likely to be mis
sionaries of Imperialism. In short, |
America's setback in the Philippine
Islands may very well combine with other i
factions to strengthen the new Demo- 1
cratic-Populist party, which may make |
a good fight in 1900. even in the East."

Rice Rupture toe,
Wonderfully Brilliant Invention
Sold at a Low Price.
A Home Cure That Is Restoring
Thousands to Perfect Health.
Many Remarkable In-
stances.
Some time ago Munsey's Magazine contained
an article on rupture with a number ot lllus-
showin.'the remarkable curat y
of a system invented by Dr. W. S. Rice 4-.S N.
Main St.. Adams, N. Y. Lawrence E. of
Syracuse, N. V.. offers another fortunate ,n-
MR. LAWRENCE E. MEYER.
stance of the marvelous results of Dr. Rice's
method. The important points are that the
rupture, no matter how large, dangerous or old
it may be, is securely and comfortably retain-
ed within the abdomen. At the same time the
broken muscles are made to grow together and
become as Arm and solid as any other portion
of the abdomen. It ls a home cure, the pa-
tient using the method himself, and the price
ls so low that everyone can afford it. Mr.
Meyer says of the cure: "I tried the method
of Dr Rice's because it seemed such a vast
improvement over anything else I had us. d
and also combined curative effects such as no
other rupture treatment contains. Of course I
hadn't much faith in the possibility of a cure,
but the results are remarkable. Whereas I
had been laid up for months before now the
rupture did not bother me for a minute. It
was only a short time when I couldn't feel any
trace of where the rupture had been an. l . I soon
was able to work all day as freely as a young
man. I advise every ruptured man or woman
to send at once and get this method, as it will
certainly cure permanently and perfectly."
! Mr. Meyer's advice Is good. Upon application
to Dr. Rice he will send you free a book that
fully explains how he cures rupture. If you
know of another person ruptured send and get
a book for him. Such an act of kindness will
be remembered all the rest of his life. Write
to-day without fall. Address Dr. W. S. Rice,

AT LOGGERHEADS
Wages Is the Bone of
Contention.
A STRIKE NOW IN PROGRESS
EACH SIDE CONFIDENT OF GAIN
ING THE VICTORY.
The Causes Leading Up to the Strike
old in the Correspond
ence â Ships Are
Tied Up.
Th" trouble between the Shipowners*
Association and the Sailors' Union of the '
Pacific has reached the acute stage. Each
patty thinks it has right on its side and i
neither will yield an 'inch The ship
owners assert they are paying "all the
traffic will bear," and the sailors hold j
that in view of the good times and the
demand for ships "poor Jack" should for
tir.ee be given more than a bare pittance.
That is how the matter stands and each j
side is using its best endeavors to carry
its Int. So far the shipowners have
carried the day, but at a great expense.
They have sent their vessels away with
non-union crews, but the said vessels
have been held In the stream for from
two to five days at an expense of at least
$300 a day.- This the Sailors' Union looks
upon as a partial victory, as the expense
to the owner has been in each instance
more than the advance in wages would
have amounted to.
It is an unequal contest. The shipown
ers have the -money and the ships. The
sailors have the men. The last time they
measured their strength the union lost.
As in the first instance the men consider
they have right on their side and in spite
of their weakness have again taken up
the gauntlet.
The following letter from the Sailors'
Union was written shortly after the ship
owners announced an advance of $5 per
month in wages. The correspondence is
self-explanatory:
BAN FRANCISCO, April 5. 1599.
Sailors' Union of the Pacific.
Charles E. Nay! Secretary Shipowners'
Association, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir:
The Sailors' Union of the Pacific, at Its
adjourned meeting, held on the 4th Inst.,
Instructed me to advise your association
that, taking iii: cognizance of the -..sting
condition of trade and the generally Im
proved times, we have decided upon the
following scale of wages from the port of '
San Prancisco:
In sailing vessels going to Puget Sound or
any other inside ports, $40 per month.
In sailing vessels to outside or open
ports, $45 per month.
In sailing vessels to Mexico. Hawaii or
Australia, $35 per month.
Siberia, Central or South America, $30
--per month.
In steamers going to Inside ports, $45 per
month.
In steamers going to outside or open
ports, ZiiO per month.
Overtime, per hour. 40 cents.
And also the following r es Â°lution: "Re
solved, That it would be for the benefit of
all concerned If the (your) association would
appoint a committee to meet a like com
mittee from the Sailors' Union to discuss
the sundry differences at present existing
along the Coast, and to make such arrange
ments as shall be deemed most expedient to
aid the Uovernment officials in carrying
out the amendments to the navigation laws
enacted by the last Congress."
Tbe Sailors' Union took this action, feel
ing thut lt is the desire of your association
as well as of the Bailors' Union, that these
laws shall be given an honest trial, and
that ether differences rest now mainly
upon mutual lack ot confidence, which we
believe could be removed if some under
standing could be reached. It will be un
derstood that any conference is contingent
upon the acceptance of the above scale of
wages from San Francisco and that other
question? are left open, to be considered in
any meeting to which your association
might agree.
Awaiting your answer, I am, in behalf of
the Sailors' Union of the Pacific, very
truly yours, A. FURUSETH, Sec.
Shipowners' Association of the Pacific
Coast.
SAN FRANCISCO, April 12, 1539.
A. Furuseth Esq., Secretary Sailors'
Union of the Paclflc â Dear Sir: Responding
to your favor of April Bth inst., I inclose
you a copy of the new scale of sailors'
wages adopted by the board of directors of
this association on March 31 last. This is
an Increase of J5 per month on all coast
ing voyages and voyages to the Islands of
the Pacific, and is considered by our peo
ple to be fair to both tbe sailor and the
Bhlp. although from a comparative and
point very liberal compensation for the ser
vice rendered. If this scale could be
maintained throughout the year out of all
Pacific Coast ports, I have no doubt it
would be entirely satisfactory to the great
majority of sailors, who are. I believe,
reasonable men. Whether it could be
malntainÂ»d would depend largely upon
themselves.
I have written so much relative to the
wage question because, while your commu
nication invites a conference for the os
tensible purpose of devising ways and
means of aiding the Government in the en
forcement of its new laws, yet you have
practically shut this association offl from
the consideration of this important matter
by inserting in your letter a condition
precedent, as follows: "'lt will be under
stood that any conference is contingent
upon the acceptance of the above scale of
wages from San Francisco," etc.
Feeling certain that, having raised wages
voluntarily J* per month, our directors
would not feel Justified. in conceding a fur
ther raise as a condition upon which the
privilege of a conference with your "' m
mittee might be secured on other questions
of apparent Importance, or at all, for r> a-
Fons already given, I deemed it useless
therefore to call a special meeting of our
Board of Directors for the purpose indicated
ln your communication. And awaiting your
further pleasure. I remain, respectfully
yours, CHARLES E. NAYLOR,
Secretary and Attorney.

** a "Â°rs." It ls not satisfactory to "sailors"
at all. it may be satisfactory to the lands
men who. under different kinds of induce
ments, are prevailed upon to go to sea for
a trip or bo. Of that we know nothing. The
proposed scale could not be made the basis
for any agreement extending along the
coast. You go on to stale that "whether
it could be maintained would depend large
ly ujon themselves (the sailors)." Seafaring
men have long understood that the main
taining of wages depended upon refusal to
accept less, but there was a hope, born of
reports circulating along the water front,
that the Ship-owners' Association might be
Willing to adopt by agreement a reasonable
scale and to adhere to the same for a speci
fied time. That the sailors would agree to
ar.y scale agreed upon was proven beyond
doubt when there was an effort to increase
wages during the prosperous years from ISSS
to 1593. You suggest further that your as
sociation is practically shut oft from any
conference because our union made such
conference "contingent upon the accept
ance of the above scale of wages from San
Francisco." You are fully aware that our
communication left "all other questions
open." and that any conference limited to
"devising ways and means of aiding the
Government in the enforcement of its new
laws" would be entered upon at any time
you should desire. â¢
You further inform us that you have
deemed It "useless" to call a meeting of
the Roard of Directors to consider our letter
of the Eth Instant. We expected that our
communication would have been considered
of sufficient importance to have been other
wise dealt with. We hoped that a confer
ence might be brought about, and took such
action as we thought advisable to that end.
If we understand your communication at
all, lt informs us that you, personally, think
that the ship-owners are unwilling to confer
with us.
Awaiting your further pleasure. I am. on
behalf of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific.
yours truly, A. FURUSETH.
Secretary.
There was no reply to the last commu
nication and thus the matter rests. The
shipowners scored heavily against the
union yesterday. Xo less than eight ves
sels sailed with non-union crews and
those that are still tied up expect to get
away to-day. The vessels .that sailed
were the . Mary Wlnkelman. W. H. Di
mond. Prussia, Occidental, Andrew
"Welch, Mary Buhne, Daisy Rowe and
Eureka. There is another big fleet getting
ready to sail, however, and the union
promises to delay their departure as much
as possible. :
The â¢ story about Captain Jensen, a
union patrolman, and a runner" in yes
terday s paper was not entirely correct.
The patrolman was carefully knocked out
by the "runner," but Captain Jensen was
not followed nor had he anything to do
with the fracas.
SHANGHAIED AND
RESCUED IN TIME
CHARLIE WAN, A CHINESE, IS
DRAGGED TO MAIL DOCK.
Placed on Board a Schooner Bound for
Alaska, but the Police Were
Notified and Took
Him Off.
1 ' Charlie Wan, a Chinese living at 618
Jackson street, was shanghaied Friday
j night and forcibly dragged by two white
men and a Chinese to the Mail Dock and
placed on board the schooner B. J. Che
ney, bound for Alaska.
Corporal Cockerill learned of the case
! and reported it yesterday morning to
! Captain Spillane, who. accompanied by
I Policemen Tyrrell and Esola, went at
| once to the Mall Dock and took Charlie
; Wan off the vessel.
Charlie told the captain that about
three months ago Jue Yick ask?d him to
sign a paper, which he said was a con
tract for Yick to go to Alaska, and if
Charlie signed it Yick could get an ad
vance of $74 on his wages. Charlie on
that representation signed the paper. He
heard nothing further of the matter, and
was surprised when two white men rep
resenting them- as police officers ap
proached him on Jackson street and '
grabbed hold of him. Gue Chung, a Chi
nese, was with the 'two men.
They told him that he had signed a con
tract to go to the Alaska fisheries, and
as the vessel was about to sail he would
have to *â¢> with them. He remonstrated
with them, but they dragged him along j
until they reached the Mail Dock and
put him aboard the vessel.
Charlie did not know where Jue Yick
' could be found, and was unable to give a
i description of the two white men, as it
was dark at the time and he was un
able to get a good ok at them. He has
been working for Louis Bloch, 707 Front
street, for me time. The poll are
searching for the kidnapers.
WHO OWNS THE HORSES?
A Witness for the Defense in the
Foster Case Gives Strong Testi
mony the Other Way.
One of the witnesses for the defense in
the case of Fred Foster, the horseman,
charged with obtaining money by false
pretenses, surprised the attorneys for the
defendant yesterday while being exam
ined in Judge Conlan's court.
Attorney E. L. Rhodes testified that he
knew both Foster and Howard, the com
plaining witness, and he never at any
time saw any acknowledgment or bill of
sale signed by Foster that Howard had a
half interest In the horses Yellow Tail and
Sam McKee ver. Foster had told him that
he did not own a hair in the tails of the
horses, and witness could never Induce
him to show him the original bill of sale
for Yellow Tail. Foster had often re
ferred to Howard's kindness and gen
erosity to him. On the night prior to
the signing of the disputed paper witness
had strongly advised Foster to settle up
the troubles between him and Howard by
giving Howard a bill of sale outright to
the two horses.
Defendant's attorneys were so staggered
by Rhodes' evidence that they declined to
requestion him, but said they would defer
it till the next calling of the case.
Garnett Ferguson, another witness for
the defense, testified that he had s*bld Sam
McKeever to Foster on January 28 for
$5000, which was paid in gold coin. The
case will be continued Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Travers Is Vindicated.
Mrs. Laura Trovers, who slapped Attor
ney Louis C. Plstotosi's face because he
Insulted her In Justice of the Peace
Dunne's court and was arrested on a
charge of battery, at the Instance erf the
irate attorney, had her case dismissed by
.Judge Graham yesterday. In Judge said
'that Plstolesl had no right to grab hold
of the defendant's arm. making it black
and blue, and she was justified In slapping
his face. '-yyy

HONESTY REWARDED IN
A TANGIBLE MANNER
DD. JONES, Interpreter of Chi
nese for the United States At
torney, was electrified yes
-1 terday on receiving a telegram
from Washington informing him that
his -salary had been increased from
$75 to $125 per month-
Jones' honesty anil the fact that he
has always refused to take a fee out
side of M;: salary is the reason for the
increase in his pay. It was asked for
by United States Circuit Judge Mor

Heacock, Internal Revenue Collector
Lynch, District Court Clerk Morse,
United States Marshal Shine, United

Before Mr. Jones was appointed to
the position he now holds it was the
custom to charge Chinese $2 for each
case in which, the Interpreter acted.

THE SAN PRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 23, 1899.
A PERMANENT
TRANSPORT FOR
THE PHILIPPINES
The Charles Nelson
to Be Purchased.
FOR USE AMONG THE ISLANDS
CLEVELAND "WILL ALSO CHANGE
HANDS AT MANILA.
River Boat T. C. Walker in Trouble.
A Sea Cook Nearly Asphyxiated.
Maxim and Vine in
I Collision.
The transports Charles Nelson and
Cleveland, now on their way to Manila,
may never come back to San Francisco.
The chances are that Admiral Dewey will
keep the Nelson, as she is just the class
of vessel he wants for an interisland
transport, and some merchants of Manila
are after the Cleveland. Friday last Cap
tain Charles Nelson received a cablo from
the Philippines asking if the Nelson was
for sale, and the answer sent back was
"No."
"If the Government wants the Charles
Nelson," said James Tyson, manager lor
Charles Nelson, yesterday, "I suppose it
will take her. She is under charter to
Uncle Sam and there is no limit to the
time he may keep her in the Islands. She
Is a splendid vessel, almost brand new, a
very big carrier for her size and draws
very little water. She was built especially
for the coast trade, and it was seen to,
when she was being planned, that there
would be no trouble in her crossing shal
low bars and getting alongside the mills
where there is very little water. She is
just the boat for an interisland transport,
but just the same I hope the Government
won't take her, as we want her here as
soon as we can get her."
It is stated authoritatively on the front
that the Nelson will go on the ways at j
Cavite, after discharging, where she will
be sheathed and coppered. She will then
be put into service between the islands.
She has accommodation for 750 troops,
and can carry 900 tons of freight. With
these she can go hundreds or miles up
the rivers in the Philippines and would
thus prove to be an invaluable boat to tlio
army. The Nelson was built at Alameda
in 1&98, and is 407 tons net burden. She is
ICS feet long, 35 feet 5 inches beam and 14
feet deep. The Cleveland was also to. be
used in the Interisland trade, but as a
merchantman, not as a transport.
â¢ All the transports now in port will get
away this week. The Morgan City will
be ready Monday night and will sail
Tuesday morning. She was moved to the
Government wharf yesterday and will
take aboard prior to sailing *-49 recruits
j and 88 officers and civilians. The Ohio and
i Senator .will probably get away Wednes-
I day afternoon. The former comes down :
j from Hunters Point to-day and will dock
!at Folsom street. The Senator is loading
at Broadway. These two vessels will take
the Thirteenth Infantry, now on its way
here from New York; and a number of
recruits. The work of getting the Leela
naw ready has been delayed owing to the
strike among the shipwrights. She will :
be ready the latter part of the week and
will take the field pieces of the light artil
lery that sailed on the Newport for Ma
nila and a number of mules for the com
missariat transport corps. The British
ship Bldston Hill, laden with supplies for
the troops, will be towed to sea to-day.-
The auxiliary cruiser Badger has been
overhauled at the Union Iron Works, and
will begin taking stores on board to-mor
row. She will sail for Samoa as soon as
the commissioners arrive from the East.
The United States steamer Nero sailed
for Honolulu last night. She will go direct
to the Islands and will begin surveying
the route for a able between Guam,
Hawaii and San Francisco.
Martin Samuels, cook on the schooner
Reliance, had a close call last Friday
night. He took a room in the lodging
house at 1314 Stockton street and came
i near to ending his life by the gas route.
| Martin went to a wedding on Wednesday
j evening and had a good time. Thursday
; he did not go back to work, but Friday
I in- was on deck as usual. Friday night
| he went Into a saloon at North Beach,
! kept by a Portuguese, and after taking
j several drinks of gin he remembers noth-
I ing more until he woke up in the hos
| pital yesterday afternoon. The landlord
i of the lodging-house says that Samuels
1 engaged a room on Friday afternoon and
i some time during the night came home
| and went to bed. He must have turned
| the gas on without lighting it, for the
i place was full of the poison when the
| landlord found him. Samuels was hur
! rled to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr.
j Hlmmelsbach worked over him for an
j hour before he was out of danger.
C. McNulty, mate of the Stockton
! steamer T. Â«'. Walker, was badly Injured
at Washington-street wharf yesterday
i morning. The vessel had just tied up
: after her trip down the river, and Mc-
I Nulty was lowering the apron to allow
i the passengers to go ashore. The apron
I is one of those affairs that la hauled -up
I and lowered by pulleys.- One pulley rope
i was broken, and as McNulty began to
lower the apron the second rope broke
and the apron fell on the mate.
McNulty's 8-year-old son was standing
on the upper deck of the steamer, and
when he saw his father under the apron
he fell to the deck in a faint. McNulty
was got from under the apron and taken
to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr. yon
der Leith found he was suffering from a
dislocation of the left knee, a number of
contusions on the side and back and a
lacerated wound of the scalp. In the
evening McNulty was sent back to his
home in Stockton on the steamer.
The Walker was unfortunate yesterdays
â  While returning to her berth nt Washing
ton wharf late in the afternoon she ran
; into the end of Clay street wharf and
ripped up nearly twenty feet of that
structure. The davits used by the Harbor,.
Commissioners! were carried away and
trie of the fender piles were broken into
splinters. The vessel was heading into the
j slip when the tide caught her and carried
her down on Clay street wharf. The
Walker was not damaged to any great ex
tent.
The schooners Vine and Maxim were in
collision off Meiggs wharf yesterday. The
Vine was lying at anchor awaiting a crew
and the Maxim was outward bound for
Casper to load lumber. When off Meiggs
wharf the Maxim missed stays and the
tide carried her down on the Vine. The
latter lost her starboard rail and the
Maxim her martingale.
Captain yon Helms of the steamer Cur
acao telegraphs the Merchants' Exchange
that the United States training ship Ad
ams was in Magdalena Bay on April 5 and
that all the boys were well and enjoying
themselves.
The battleship lowa will be open for in
spection to-day and the launches Amy ard
William D will carry visitors from Fol
som-street wharf to her.
H. J. Blsh came down from I'kiah last
Friday and yesterday morning was robbed
of $I'JO at the ferries. He was expecting
some friends by the early morning train
and went down to meet them. In his fob
pocket he carried five $20 gold piece?, and
white he was in the crowd some thief used
a sharp knife and took both pocket and
twenr'es. He reported the matter to Cap
tain Dunieavy. hut the police have vety
little hopes of finding either pocket or
Money.
Captain Inman Sealby leaves on his last
voyage in the Coptic in a day or two. On
.the return of the vessel to San Francisco
Captain Rinder. who was here in the Bel
gic, will command her. Captain Sealby is
one of- the most popular masters in the
employ of the Occidental and Oriental
Company. He has been coming here since
1893 and was formerly first officer of the
Oceanic. The chances are he will take
command of one of the new steamers now
being built for the White Star line. Chief
Steward Gliddqn of the Coptic is going
back into the railroad business and his
place will be filled by Thomas Lilly.
The coast survey steamer Patterson will
leave for St. Michael on June 1. Captain
Pratt goes out in command and W. A.
O'Malley will he executive officer.
ART GALLERY ANNEX TO
MARK HOPKINS INSTITUTE
MONEY FOR ENTERPRISE CON
TRIBUTED BY MR. SEARLES.
The Architect Estimates That the
Structure Will Cost Twenty-Six
Thousand Dollars.
No time will be lost in building the art
gallery annex of the Mark Hopkins In
stitute. It is now ascertained that the
sum of $26,000 will be required to construct
the gallery according to the accepted
plans. Yesterday Horace G. Plan, repre
senting Mr. Searles. made a payment to
the architect and directed that the work
should go on at once.
The artists have long desired a suitable
gallery, with proper light for the display
of their pictures. When the "long felt
want" was exhibited to Mr. Searles he
asked for estimates of the cost. At first
the modest sum of $15,000 was mentioned,
but when the architects and the artists
finished their calculations the figures of
cost were, Increased. Mr. Searles met each
advance in a generous spirit, but request
ed, just prior to his departure, that the
outlay be kept as near $25,000 as possible. ;

HIRT'S DEATH
ACCOMPANIED
BY A MYSTERY
Thought to Have Died
of Consumption.
POISON FOUND IN THE BODY
DOUBTS AT HOSPITAL AUTOPSY
RESOLVED BY A CHEMIST.
Two Days in His Room ij?lrtly Un
conscious Before He Received
Medical Attention and Then
It Was Too Late.
.
There is a mystery about the death of
Bonifacius Hirt, who was sent from . the
What Cheer House to the County Hospital
| last Thursday and died there on the same
| day.
Hirt was a printer, 63 years old, and had
roomed at the What Cheer House for the
past year. Up to a week or two ago he
had been of shiftless and Intemperate
habits, but he suddenly became more
J careful of himself and remained by the
j stove in the offlce of the lodging house.
He had been suffering for a long time
with consumption, and appeared to grow
weaker and weaker every day. On Tues
day morning the bedmaker reported to
the clerk that the door of Hirt's room was
locked and that he had looked over tho
trantom and bad seen Hirt asleep.
The clerk decided not to disturb the old
man, and nothing more was seen of Hirt
until the next morning, Wednesday, when
the bedmaker had a similar experience.
The clerk and the bedmaker rapped loud
ly at the door, but received no reply. Then
they stood on a chair and called to Hirt.
He replied, "I'm all right," but they could
not induce him to get up and open the
door. Finally, after a half hour of hard
work, the key was poked out of the lock
and the door was opened.
Finding Hirt in a semi-unconscious con
dition tho clerk notified the Board of
Health that the man was dying and that
an ambulance should be sent to take him
to the City and County Hospital. The
clerk says that he received an answer to
the effect that the hospital was crowded
and that there was no room there for the
What Cheer House lodger. A second and
more urgent summons was sent to the
health offlce and on the following morning
the ambulance was sent and Hirt was
conveyed to the hospital. â¢
He died there on the same day, appa
rently of consumption, and an autopsy
was held by Dr. Tillman, who found, in
addition to the evidences of the disease, a
puncture in the gullet, which might have
been caused by a corrosive poison. Coro
ner Hill was notified of that fact and the
body was conveyed to the Morgue, where
the stomach was removed and handed to
Chemist Crackbon for analysis.
Yesterday morning Mr. Crackbon re
ported to Coroner Hill that he had found
\ carbolic acid in the stomach of the de
ceased in sufficient quantities to have
caused death. The What Cheer House
clerk said yesterday that no carbolic acid
or any trace of that or any other poison
was found in Hirt's room. The people at
the hospital seemed to be unaware that â 
Hirt had taken poison and ascribed his
partly comatose condition to the ravages
of consumption.
Coroner Hill will hold an inquest on the
case to-morrow morning.
Hirt was receiving a pension of $12 per
month from the Government, he having
enlisted in the Seventh New York Heavy !
Artillery on September 5, 1884. Before be
ing taken down with his last sickness he
worked on the German Demokrat. He
claimed to be the father-in-law of Cap
tain Spillane of the Police Department.
The deceased was buried yesterday by
the G. A. R.

Have you ever considered what neg- *
lecing your kidneys means?
Have you ever realized the terrible
risk you are taking?
Do you not pass on the streets, every
day, men and women whose counten-
ances show that the final stake is up
and the die being cast?
How may you know them?
By their pale, sallow, sunken or
bloated countenances, dull, lack-luster
eyes, puffy or dark circles under the
eyes, slow, languid movements,
blotched, pimpled, unhealthy complex-
ions, and general appearance of weak-
ness and debility.
In addition to their outward appear-
ance, how do they feel themselves?
Weak, worn out, tired, languid, rest-
less, nervous, irritable and worried
. easily over trifles, feverish, chilly, short
j of breath, dizzy, irregular heart, rheu-
j matic, with pain or dull ache in the
' back, neuralgic, sleepless, generally de-
: bilitated and used up.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys cause
all these symptoms.
Your kidneys are the most important
organs of the body.
They work to keep you in health by
filtering out of you*, blood the poisons
and germs of disease.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great

the Spring Valley Water Company has
since 1593 been overpaid a total amount
of $8110 91 for water furnished Alamo
Square and Alta Plaza. The contention of
the water company is that water supplied
other squares was charged against Alamo
Square in order to avoid confusion in the
itemizing of bills. The committee took no
positive action, but. the majority of the
members were of the opinion that the
amount of. the alleged overcharge should
be deducted from the next bills presented

BLUE AND " COLD OF BERKELEY WAVES IN TRIUMPH ON CINDER PATH AND IN DEBATE.
VICTORY FOR THE
BLUE AND GOLD
TRACK ATHLETES
Stanford Again Meets
Crushing Defeat.
BIG CROWD IN ATTENDANCE
AT ANNUAL INTERCOLLEGIATE
DAY AT BERKELEY.
Little* Enthusiasm Manifested Over
the Games, While the Cardinal
Gets the Ax Right in the
Neck.
Bitter was the medicine that the Uni
versity of California forced down the
throats of the Stanford athletes during
the past year. The annual football game
was the first acrid dose, then came the
baseball defeat and now as a climax to <
their athletic travail Stanford must bear
I rushing blow in the shape of a track
1 field knock-out.
The largest crowd that has ever gath
-3 for a field day in Berkeley saw the
heme team play with the visitors yester
day afternoon. California's victory did
depend so much upon the inherent
:ngth of her team as upon the inferior
lity of her opponent. Stanford was
lelessly weak in the field and to this
lue the great discrepancy in the' score,
Ich read 74 to 43 when the last event
; tabulated. On the track Stanford had
'airly strong team, especially in the
[-(-distance events. . .
here was nothing in this year's Inter
calate field and track battle to excite
;rest. It seemed a foregone conclusion
t California would come out â¢of the
lggle with glowing colors and no spe
animalion characterized the specta
s who filled the benches. Although
general result was no other than
it was anticipated, me surprises In
sprints and longed i stance events were
in store tor the Berkeley men. Not a
(le record was broken, yet a few of the
l-s proved exciting enough to force a
mentary throb in the breasts of the
s lpathetic spectators,
lie finals ot" the 100-yard dash and the
.-mile run were the .â¢are events. In
sprint race Simonds and woolsey,
resenting California, and Stewart and
11 from Stanford darted out together
the shot of the pistol. Down the
rse they came, making a single line
oss the track. About the 50-yard
-k the four began to separate. Simonds
Stewart forging ahead of their com
petitors. The race was between these two
and each man fought hard for first place.
It looked lor till the world as if a dead
heat would result, when Stewart, on his
last stride, broke the '.ape with a bound,
an Inch ahead of his blue and gold rival.
In the half-mile run Uie last lap brought
strange results. Moser of California took
the lead and Smith and Williams of
Stanford trailed him twice around the
track. Then me Warnick. another blue
and gold shirt. Th( pack followed far in
the rear. When the spurt began Moser
had a working lead, out Williams and
Smith and even Chadbourne, another car
dinal athlete, seemingly miles behind,
had speed enough eft 1., win a dozen
such races. In a spurt Williams burst
forward, pulling Smith with him. It was
the end of Moser and â  arnick, both of
whom were pressed by Â« Had!.. .urn.-, who
was not even thought of. Williams won
the race with Smith a close second.
The best time was made in the mile, a
race in which no California man was a
possibility. Williams and Smith were on
their mettle, and they finished in a strong
Epurt In the very good time of 4:39 4-5.

Outside Districts Have Been Sadly ,
Neglected by the Old. Electric
Light Company.
Out of the twenty or more improvement
clubs in this city not one has been found
to oppose the resolution introduced by
Supervisor Attridge for the privilege of
granting to competitive light companies I
the right to erect poles upon which wires
may be strung with the view of giving to
the people in outside sections of the city ;
a cheap rate of illumination.
A good many of the clubs which have
held meetings during the week have with
out any exception passed resolutions fa- j
voring the stand taken by Supervisor At
tridge, and have requested his brother
city legislators to vote with him on the
measure in order that it may become a I
law. The Precita Valley Improvement j
Club, which held its meeting on last Fri- |
day night, passed a resolution favoring !
the scheme, that expression coming from
this old and well recognized club appeared
in yesterday's Call. A similar expression
was had at a previous meeting of the Fed
erated Mission Improvement Clubs, j
which body has delegates from all of the '
improvement clubs located in the Mission,
extending to Ocean View and the county ;
line. -
With the members of the clubs the pres
idents are united to a man, a few of
whom, when spoken to yesterday, simply
reiterated the sentiments of their clubs
thus:
George R. Fletcher, president of the
Point Lobos Improvement Club Why of
course I am in favor of the resolution in
troduced by Supervisor Attridge, and I
sincerely hope and trust that the other
members of the board will vote in ac
cordance with the views of .Supervisor
Attridge.
Dr. Charles V. Cross, president of the i
Western Addition Improvement Ciubâ !
Quote me as being in favor of Supervisor
Attridge's resolution, and while I had not
an opportunity of bringing the matter be
fore the members of the club I know full
well the sentiments of each and all on
this subject as being favorable to its pas- '
sage. -

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 23, 1899.
Three matches were played, two singles
and a double. In the singles Sam Hardy
of Stanford* beat his brother Sumner
Hardy of California, and Hunt of Califor
nia beat Spencer of. Stanford. In the
doubles Sam Hardy and Schneider of
Stanford defeated Sumner. Hardy and
Stone, representing the blue and gold.
Five sets were necessary to decide the
doubles. The first two sets went to Sam
Hardy and Schneider without any great
effort on their part. . Both the Hardys
were playing their customary careful
mo. volleying and placing with ac
curacy.
The next set went to the Californians
with a score of 6â2. This gave the blue
and gold team heart, and the fourth set
was attached, but not without a struggle.
The score read 6 â 4. With two sets each
the rival teams came back to the courts
after a short rest. The pace set by Sum
ner Hardy and Stone in their last two
sets began to tell, and the Stanford team
! of directors of the Polk Street Merchants'
I Associationâ for myself, and I am
1 more than sure, if I had an opportunity
: of consulting the other members of the
association, that one and all would favor
Supervisor Attridge's resolution.
Thomas B. Slevin, president of the Po
trero and Mission Improvement ClubÃy
all means, I am in favor of the resolu
. tion introduced by Supervisor Att ridge.
Why shouldn't I? It will be the means
of getting electric lights extended to out
side sections of the city; just the very
i thing that we have been battling for in
our club for years. The resolution in
| troduced by Supervisor Attrtdge strikes
i the keynote. Such a resolution should
have been on the city law books long
ago.
Presidents of other improvement clubs
who favor Supervisor. Attridge's resolu
tion are: Mission and Five Mile House,
i Dr. Kmil N. Torello: Fairmount, Chris
Stader; West of Castro street. F. H. Qual
man; Sunset, Richard Keller; Sunny
side. Gustav Sclmee; Mission Business
Men's Association, L. A. Souc; Potrero,
John Barduhn; Holly Park, Thomas
O'Xeil. and San Francisco Improvement
Club, No. 1 South. Charles Milly.
Representing the labor associations, P.
H. McCarthy, president of the Builders'
and Trades Council, indorses the resolu
tion presented by Supervisor Attridge and
trusts in the honesty and good judgment
of the other Supervisors to carry it into
operation.
As a stronger indorsement of the senti- 'â 
i ments of the resolution, the improvement
club recently organized in South San
Francisco at its meeting last night, after
transacting other important business per
taining to the local wants of the district,
adopted the following resolution as the
sense of the club:
Whereas, Supervisor Attridge has introduced
a resolution before the Board of Supervisors
; having for its motive the object of granting
the privilege to persons and corporations the
i right to erect poles along the streets of the
city in what Is known as outside flre limits;
i therefore, be it
Resolved, That the San Francisco Improve
i ment Club No. 1 South in meeting assembled
I do most heartily indorse the said resolution
i and respectfully recommend its final passage
; by the members of the Board of Supervisors;
I and be It further
j Resolved. That we believe that the passage
of said ordinance is a necessity, and will tend
to the reduction of light rates to the citizen's
in general and the residents of this portion of
San Francisco In particular, and will give to
j the people the advantage of better' Illuminated
I streets the year round. <
As a 'conclusive indorsement from the
representatives of all the improvement
clubs embodying the large area of the
Mission district who have delegates in the
Mission Federation of- Improvement Clubs
the following resolution was unanimously
passed at the meeting of the federation
last night at the Fairmount Club:
Resolved, That we, the members of the Fed
eration of Mission Improvement Clubs, at a
meeting held this 22d day of April, do most
cheerfully indorse the resolution Introduced by
Supervisor Attridge, whereby it is intended to
grant to the ' Mutual Electric Light Company
the privilege of erecting poles and wires in
districts lying outside of the so-called fire
limits, the object being to give to the people
an opportunity of getting a choice as between
a company having no opposition and one who
wishes to enter into competition for. the pur
pose of supplying light to the citizens at re
duced rates. Therefore, we recommend that
the Board of Supervisors vote for and pass the
resolution as introduced by Supervisor At
tridge, as it Is to the benefit and in the inter
est of the resident and property owners of out
lying sections of the city.
CONVICTS SENTENCED.

Louis Richard was sentenced to- five
years' imprisonment in San Quentin yes
terday for burglary. .A short time ago
while the convict was plying his trade, he
was caught in a room of the Western

the same prison for a term of five years
for burglary. He entered the rooms of
Mary Gortes, at Pine and Taylor streets,
and was looting the premises when ar
rested.
Judge Dunne sentenced Joseph Monroe
to four years in San Quentin for burglary
and George Mason, to live years in San
Quentin for the same offense.
The sentencing of Cal Childs and John
Piggott, convicted of grand larceny, was
continued for one week.

ESTATES OF THE DEAD.
Wills of Joseph Durroux and Sidney;
A. Rackliffe Filed.
The will of- Joseph Durroux, who died
April 5, was filed for probate yesterday."
His ( state, which consists of personal
property, including stocks in the Spring
; Valley. Water Works and - .the Giant
recovering Its former activity won out
the match by a score of 6â3. The full
score was 6â3, 3â6, 2â6, 4â6, 6â3.
Hunt of California and Spencer of
Stanford then crossed rackets In singles.
The game was a listless one, devoid of in
terest to the spectators. Spencer se
cured one set. The first set went to Hunt,
7â5, the second was won with an easy
score, 6â2; the third set was appropriated
by the Stanford man, 9â7, and the fourth,
which gave the match to the blue and*
gold, was won 7â5. Both players were on
a par, which explains the closeness of the
score.
The match between Sam Hardy and
Sumner Hardy was the surprise of the
day. By agreement a five-set contest was
waived, best two out of three being sub
stituted in the place. The flrst set was
won by Sumner Hardy, 6â4, after some
very fine tennis by both players. The
next two sets were captured by Sam
Hardy without any difficulty. The cardi
nal representative smashed, drove,
volleyed and "bobbed" with an accuracy
and sureness that left his brother panting
in surprise. Sumner could not strike his
own pace, anrl before he realized what
had happened Brotner Sam had won the
match. The score was 4â6, 6âl, 6â2.

NATIONAL GUARD.
Another Candidate Looms Up for Ad
jutant Generalâ Talk of Officers
Who Are Dissatisfied.
Another week has passed and the Na
tional Guard of the State is no nearer re
organization than it was at the begin
i ning of the month. The muster rolls
; which were expected from the com
: panics that have expressed a willingness
1 to return to the service of the State have
j not yet been, forwarded to the proper of
| ficials.
A number of officers who have reported
are exceedingly anxious to ascertain who
will be adjutant general and major gen
eral. Some of these have declared that
if the men nominated for these positions
1 are not the kind who will advance the
interest of the citizen soldiery they will
throw up their commissions.
The latest candidate that has been
named for the office of adjutant general
is Lieutenant Colonel Duboce of the First
California Volunteers, now at Manila.
Captain A. J. Kelleher, regimental ad
jutant of the First California Volunteers,
I who held that position for many years
in the First Infantry, N. G. C, prior to
entering the volunteer service, is now on
1 his way back to this city.
Everything in the Naval Militia is
moving along smoothly. It is the only
branch of the National Guard that is
displaying any activity at this time.
Battalion orders will shortly be issued
j and a number of recommendations will
' be made. C. R. Allenger, a petty officer,
will be recommended for the position of
mate on the Marion; K. J. Lewis, pay
master's yeoman on the Pinta, will also
â¢be recommended for the position of mate.
I There are a number of applicants for the
position of chief cockswain on the Ma
rion. Lieutenant Shaw will preside at an
election to be. held in the. third division
to fill a vacancy created by the resigna
tion of Lieutenant Junior .Grade Morgan.
Lieutenant Hunt will preside at an elec
tion to lie held in the division at Santa
Barbara to fill a vacancy caused by the
resignation of Lieutenant Junior Grade
Squires.
Those men who served in the auxiliary
fleet during the Spanish-American war
are filing their claims for one month's
extra pay allowed them.
On the afternoon of Saturday, the 15th
inst., two boats left the Marion with a
; number of men to make a landing on An
i gel Island. The first/designated as. the
Pioneer, was under command of Lieuten
ant W. F. Burke, who had eighteen men,
and the other, which left about four hours
later, was the ship's sailing launch,
in which there were twenty men under
command of Lieutenant Harloe. A land
ing was effected at Chinese Camp on the
east shore of the island and tents were
pitched for the night. At daylight there i
was breakfast and the men were marched I
to a plateau, where, with a one-pounder i
they had brought with them, they had a i
drill in the artillery branch, as required
by the new tactics. In the afternoon, af
ter a lunch and a short rest, the two
boats sailed as far as Red Rock and then
returned to the city.
NEW SEWERAGE tLANS.
Engineers Will â  Have to Rush Work
to Have Them Ready This Year.*
It begins to look as though San Fran
cisco was about to enter upon an era of
municipal improvements which are de
signed to place it on a par with the great
cities of the country. To-morrow night
the Board of Supervisors' is exnected to
appoint a commission to draught plans
for a sewerage system, and " Marsden
Manson and B. C. Grunsky will, from
present indications, be selected for this
important work. . Mr. Grunsky said-yes
terday that under normal circumstances
a year would be none too much time to
allow the engineers .." to prepare their
re-port, but in. view of the necessity of
holding the bond election during the
present year the report would have to be
ready by the Ist of October, in order. that
the Supervisors might have ample op
portunity to consider It before the people
were asked to vote upon the scheme.
He thought that this could be done by
rushing matters, and if the board decides
to employ . a sewerage commission work
on the plans will begin at once and be
rushed to completion. San Francisco is
advantageously situated for the construc
tion of a perfect system of drainage, but
still there are numerous obstacles- in the
way of grades and low lands to be over
. come. However, the problem is not re
garded as one of exceptional difficulty.
It will take several years to, place the
city in first class sanitary condition, but
the project now under consideration is
regarded as a step in the right direction.

DEBATERS FROM
BERKELEY WIN
FROM STANFORD
Have Popular Side of
the Argument.
JUDGES ARE NOT UNANIMOUS
STANFORD'S STRONG PRESENTA
TION AGAINST RETENTION.
Believe the Occupation of the Philip
pines Is Against Democratic
Principles as Outlined in
the Declaration."
The University of California debaters
were declared victors last night in their
annual meeting with representatives of
Leland Stanford Junior University. The
subject of the argument was the
question uppermost in the minds of the
American people at the present time:
Resolved; That the retention of the
Philippines is contrary to the princi
ples , for . which this , Government
should" stand.
It was expressly provided that the
debate should be decided upon the
skill of the presentation of argument
more than on the merits of the con
troversy. Working along these lines
it was the general impression in the
audience that the honors would rest
with the young men from Stanford,
as their logical presentation of facts
was admitted to be much superior to
that of their opponents. Two of the
latter's representatives contented
themselves chiefly with ridiculing the
arguments of the opposition without
trying to controvert them. The judges
of the debateâ E. W. Britt, Judge
James M. Seawell ' and William M.
Piersonâ were divided in their opin
ions as to where the honors should go.
It was finally announced that the ma
jority cast their vote for the Univer
sity of California, while the remaining '
member of the committee favored the
Stanford men. They declined to dis
close the individual vote, but it was
surmised that the judicial mind of
Judge Seawell was not involuntarily
swayed by the question under debate.
The attendance indicated that exhi- .
bitions of brawn by the athletes rep
resenting the two great institutions of
learning were not the only affairs that .
attracted friends of the students.
* Metropolitan Hall was crowded to the
doors long before the debate opened,
and thus was paid mute tribute to the
highest objects of the universities. The
aisles of the hall were packed, al
though early in the evening police
barred the doors and denied admission
to hundreds of people. The patience
of the audience seemed inexhaustible,
as none left the building until the re
sult was announced.
The college yells, without which no
intercollegiate function would be com
plete, were given in a sharp, incisive
manner. The tempo seemed faster
than that heard on gridiron and cinder
path, the organized shouters apparent
ly being under better control of their
leaders. The ax which has played so
prominent a part in the affairs of the
colleges was the subject of much good
natured chaffing between the students.
President David Starr Jordan and
President Martin Kellogg attended the
debate together and watched with in
terest the struggles of the debaters.
The University of California men
were particularly jubilant, as in the
afternoon their athletes had scored a
decisive victory over the Cardinal, who
had to find solace in their win of the
tennis championship, about the only
thing they save,] out of the wreck.
The debaters were: For the affirma
tiveâJohn Springer, James Ferguson
and Anthony Suzzallo of Leland Stan
ford Jr. University. For the negativeâ
W. M. Martin. C. M. Warner and I.
Golden of the University of California.
Professor Charles Mills Gayley pre
sided over the meeting and Introduced
the speakers. John Springer of Stan
ford opened the debate. He held the
question before the Government at
the present time to be whether in
retaining the Philippines it is violating
any of the principles for which it
should stand. This Government, he
said, should stand for democratic
principles as they are laid down in the
Declaration of Independence, which
says that all men are. created equal
and are entitled to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. The speaker
contended that the democratic princi
ples apply to the people of this country
now as strongly as they did in IT.*;,
when that great document was framed.
At that time the Americans were the
weaker people struggling for liberty
and he likened them to the Filipinos
of the present day. lie did not think it
the duty â¢of democracy to invent : a
new _ government and 'then go cruis
ing around the world forcing that
governnment upon unwilling people.
To perform this alleged duty in the
Philippines will require a vast army.
He thought it better to bring back
these soldiers and make of them men
and not military machinery. . This
country was the first to adopt dem
ocratic principles and one* by one the
â  others have followed until nearly all
the world believes In them. Thesedem
ocratic principles apply to all people,
whether they be white or black or
brown.
In conclusion the speaker reiterated
his statement that it was no part of
democracy to force a government
upon unwilling people
W. M. Martin was the first speaker
for the University of California. He
dwelt on the dangers of jingoism and
said â  the retention of the Philippines
was believed in by big men who never
stood for radicalism or jingoism. He
said the responsibility of the United
States in the islands should be re
membered. He pictured the position In
which Dewey was nlaced last April,
when he found himself in Hongkong
harbor and had either to fight the
Spaniards or slink home across the
' Pacific. After the battle of Manila,
in which he was victorious, the army
â  j of occupation became a necessity. The
speaker contended chat this republic
is not fighting for -glory; but for the
preservation of law and . order. The
Philippines came into its possession
because of a war. which was â¢ waged
for humanity and justice. To\argue
that the United States should with
draw now is to urge the Government
to shirk the duties which belong to it
It is a duty to the Philippines, to
civilization and to ourselves. To sur
: render the islands to the natives would
: be. absurd, he declared, as they are
not fitted to maintain a government
â¢ and could not organize. one. It would
not- do to hand them over; to the in
surgents, who are in a minority, nor
can they be handed over to any other
nation, as this would incur the- hos
tility of nations not participating. it
â¢ was. incompatible with honor to take
any course except retention. If we
withdraw the nations will say we are
too weak or -too corrupt to rule the
islands. * -
James "Ferguson, for Stanford Uni
versity, claimed the previous speaker
had not considered conditions as they
exist but had argued on conditions as
they -were before "the war. He said
they were attempting, to govern with
out the consent of the governed He
thought the best policy was that of
helping the new nation, the motto
being, "Hands off and walk alone "
The succeeding speakers for each
side enlarged upon the ideas .outlined
by their leaders. The decision of the
judges in favor of the University of
California was received with such
demonstrations of joy as marked the
winning of the. football game last
Thanksgiving day.

Remarkable Effects From the Foso Method of

esteemed citizen of Dayton, Ky., has regained

â¢ _-sb. His scalp was perfectly smooth, entirely
levoid of hair and In the condition which most
people believe to be utterly incurable. He had
tried various scalp treatments and remedies, but
all to no purpose, and his last effort with the
well known l-'oso treatment was begun wllh
but little faith. The results, however, were so
much greater than he had anticipated and came
so Quickly and with such substantial proof that
Mr. Collins is very much elated. He now has
an entire new growth of hair of natural color
and vigor and. Is very much pleased to give

Edward Hannan was first registered

day of his death.
Hannan's Almshouse record is one
long tale of duties faithfully per
formed, courteous. treatment to all and
profound appreciation for the many
little acts of kindness shown him. He
â¢was wonderfully industriousâ un
usual trait for inmates of the Alms
houseâand delighted in making him
self useful. He seemed especially
adapted to care for the dead and over
3000 bodies were by him. prepared for
their last long sleep.
The. Almshouse officials, in speak
ing of "old Ned," have only the kind
est and the best to say of him, all
illustrative of his genial disposition
and unusual industry. A death al
ways found him ready for duty and
no matter how late the hour and cold
the night Ned would shuffle into his
clothes and proceed to perform the
last sad rites for his erstwhile fellow
sufferer. Hannan only had one fault
âotherwise he would not have been of
this world and certainly never would
have come to the poorhouse â he liked
the black bottle and now and then fell
by the roadside. His lapses from
strict sobriety, however, were but few
and far between, and when he was
"under the Influence" he was mild
and inoffensive.
Hannan was a native of Ireland, 81
years of age, and single. The cause
of death was old age. The burial will
take place on Monday and the remains
of the "Morgue man" will be laid to
eternal rest in the Catholic burying
ground.
HOT SHOT FIRED AT
GOVERNOR H. T. GAGE
WAS ROASTED FOR KILLING THE
PURE FOODS BILL.
J. W. Kerr Says That the Executive
Destroyed the Measure That
Men of Brains Created.
At a meeting of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association on Friday J. W.
Kerr, chairman of the pure foods commit
tee, presented a report that has not been
equaled for a long time. In very pointed
language he gave Governor Gage one of
the worst roastings for killing the pure
foods bill that an executive ever experi
enced in the history of the State. Mr.
Kerr called attention to the efforts of the
association, the Board of Health and a
number of other commercial bodies, to
say nothing of the efforts of individual
citizens, to secure the passage and ob
servance of laws that would protect the
manufacturer and consumer *r>f the prod
ucts of the State from the Injuries worked
by the unprincipled persons who adul
terate every food product they can han
dle. After all of these efforts what was
considered to be a just law was framed
and passed by the Legislature, and went
to the Governor for his signature. The
bill died In that official's pocket, and of |
this Mr. Kerr says:
"I did not believe that a man could ever
be found In the position of Governor of
the State of California who would refuse'
i to approve such a measure. Neverthe-
I less, no stone was left unturned ln dis
j charging our duty, and we confidently
| awaited the result, only to be doomed to
' disappointment by what would seem to
: be an unreasoning and arbitrary exercise
1 of authority. * * * * That bill originat
ed from a convention of representative
men from every part of the State. It pro
; posed to deal with conditions which have
; been recognized as great evils by other
States of this Union and by the most ad
[ vanced nations of the world. It was not
! the child of darkness in regard to which
i any one could plead lack of knowledge.
' This association, through its officers, had
1 for three years openly and fairly agitated
i this question until every citizen of the
. State knew of the pure food movement
and Its purpose. â¢
"The people had responded to the cry
of our farmers for help and their repre
sentatives had approved the demand for
protection. One man has undertaken to
| set aside all their demands, to render void
your work of years. The question of
: State economy could not have entered
' Into the question, for the same hand
which withheld approval of this work
signed the appropriation for a Governor's
mansion, Involving an expenditure of
three times the amount called for in the
pure food bill, and certainly If times were
pressing the Governors of California could
have Stayed out of doors a little longer
without any detriment to themselves or
to the interests of the State. Under the
present circumstances the striking down
of this effort on the. lines of commercial
honesty and good business morals looks
like an arbitrary and unwarranted exer
cise of authority. * * *
"It is with mingled feelings of indigna
tion and regret that I have to report that
the years of unselfish work and expendi
ture of money on the part of this asso
ciation, the desire of the people and the
favorable action of the Legislature should
all have failed at that very point where
we had a right to expect thoughtful, con
siderate and public-spirited action."

STRANGE VICTORIES OVER DIS-

The Lame Made to Walk, the Deaf to Hear
and Blind to See â Female Weakness
and Rheumatism Absolutely Cured
at 440 Geary Street, San
Francisco.
A reporter's visit to the office of
Healer Truth, at 440 Geary street, yes-
terday, was prolific of interesting ex-
periences and served to show to an as-
tonishing degree the work now being
performed by that healer in this city
and elsewhere.
Over 3000 patients are now undergo-
ing treatment at Healer Truth's hands,
and still the number is increasing
daily. People who have been deformed
nearly all of their lives and who were
obliged to go on crutches; others wear-
ing cumbersome trusses, and still oth-
ers who were brought in on litters,
were made whole after a few visits and
recovered the full use of their limbs.
It is intended in this article to refer in
detail to several of the more important
cures effected by this remarkable
healer.
N. S. Hawley of Greenfield, Mass.,
who came to California suffering from
a kidney and bladder trouble of ten
years' standing, Was relieved almost
instantaneously by Healer Truth, and
is now thoroughly recovered.
Mrs. Mary P. Thompson of Detroit,
Mich., met with an accident while
traveling some years ago and received
injuries which developed into a cancer
of the womb. Hearing of Healer
Truth's remarkable work here, she
came to San Francisco and consulted
him. She decided to undergo treat-
ment, and in a few weeks' time she was
enabled to return home completely re-
stored to her former good health and
spirits.
Mrs- Mary Millorn, 441 Geary street,
was for years a sufferer from chronic
headache, which caused her endless
agony. This trouble was the result of
female disorders. After taking a few-
treatments every vestige of her trouble
permanently disappeared.
At a distance Healer Truth has per-
formed some remarkable cures. A few
of these are given below, the initials
only being used. For fuller details con-
cerning these, inquiries are directed to
Healer Truth, who is not at liberty to
publish or cause to be published the
full names and addresses of his pa-
tients.
Mrs. M. McM.' of Tesla,. CaL, writes
j that she is improving greatly under
I Healer Truth's treatments. Her trou-
ble is general debility and asthmatic
affection. Mrs. A. A. E. of Grass Val-
ley writes: "I am slowly improving.
My prayer every night is that no harm
shall befall you, such a grand work as
you are doing." L. E. of Hawthorne,
Nev., a sufferer from hip disease,
; writes that he is greatly relieved. Mrs.
E. T. of Crockett, Cal., reports that her
son and herself are both gradually re-
â¢ covering from distressing troubles of
j long years' standing.
Mrs. C. B. Barden of 77 Pleasant ave-
j nue suffered from a tumor which, ac-
cording to the advice of her physician,
I Dr. Bangs, would develop into a cancer
unless operated upon. Mrs. Barden
began treatments with Healer Truth,
and after twelve treatments she was
1 completely cured and returned to her
! home a highly delighted woman.
P. L. of Berryessa, who is a victim
; of a disease of the bladder, writes un-
: der date of April 13 that the disease is
gradually subsiding under Healer
Truth's ministrations. "I am gaining
1 strength," she writes, "and have a
good appetite. I shall soon walk. I
; praise God for all his mercies in this
great deliverance from suffering."
Miss Dora Gardenieyer of Llvermore
was deaf for years, but after a * few
treatments Healer Truth was enabled
to restore her. Miss Nora Miner,
Roekville, Conn., was cured of con-
sumption after being given up to die
and after suffering several exhausting
hemorrhages. McKenzie Carpenter,
220 Washington street, Keene, N. H.,
was permanently cured of kidney trou-
ble and rheumatism. Frank A. Bemis
of this city was cured of lost vitality,
weak back and impaired memory. He:
was unable to work for years, . but is
now stronger than ever before in his 'â 
career. C. R. T. of Grass Valley, lost i
manhood and exhausted vitality, was
completely restored. . 77 , .
Gilbert Mansfield, 289 Valencia street, j
was cured of nervous prostration three j
months ago, and since that time has ;
gained twenty-five pounds of flesh.
T. J. H. of Ashland, Ore., a sufferer
from rheumatism, writes that his con- ;
dition after one month's treatment has
changed wonderfully. Mrs. H., who is
being treated for nervous headache, is j
now almost well. W. H. Barden of j
Agnews Station was a victim of the j
morphine habit for nine years, and suf-
fered from a paralysis of the optic
nerve. He was cured after a few treat-
ments.
Miss Maggie Galeman of this city
had lost her voice completely, but after
three or four treatments by Healer
Truth she recovered its use again. Mrs.
Cora Delorme, 1081 Main street, Hart-
ford, Conn., an absent patient, was
cured of female weakness and nerve
trouble of the most aggravated type
after several treatments.
Mrs. J. Lavez, 322 Seventh street,
used crutches for nearly six years be-
cause of an affection of the knee joints.
After one treatment she was enabled
to walk unaided. One knee joint* is still
stiff, owing to the result of an opera-
tion performed by an eminent surgeon
of this city, but otherwise she is com-
pletely cured. M. A. D. of Dunbar,
speaking of his daughter, says her cure
amazed her friends, who had despaired
of ever seeing her leave her home
again. ' M.

ONE OF THE HINCKLEYS.
A Descendant of a Family Prominent
in the Early Days of the Country
Passes Away.
The remains of the late Ezra Hinck
! ley, who died suddenly a few days ago at
| his home, 574 Folsom street, will be fol
; lowed to their last resting-place to-day
by the members of Apollo Lodge, I. O.
!O. F. The funeral service will be held
iln Memorial Hall, Odd Fellows' build-
Ing, under the auspices of the lodge. Mr.
: Hinckley was born in "Walworth, New
; York, in 1826, and was a descendant of a
j family that was prominent ln the colo
: nial and ante-revolutionary period of the
i country. One of his ancestors was Sam
uel Hinckley, who for fifty years served
in public life. He was a deputy magis
; trate, assistant governor of the "Plymouth
Colony, and a Commissioner of the Con
federated Colonies of New England, who
died at Barnstable, Mass., at the age of
88. The well-known Crocker family of
this city and State and some branches of
the Hinckley family, notably that of the
late Fritz Hinckley, who married Flor

FLOOD STAKE
CAPTURED BY
LUCKY MEROPS
With Piggott in the
Saddle.
ULM SHOULD HAVE SCORED
DEFEAT DUE TO THE RIDING OF
McNICHOLS.
Large Attendance and Lively Bet
ting at Oakland â Four Favorites
Dethroned Ailyar Again
Wins Galloping.
The attractive card drew an old-fash
i ioned crowd to Oakland track yesterday,
i and the layers of odds were highly elated
lat the play. As four of the six favorites
were knocked down, the booking frater
nity had all the best of the argument. *
The Flood handicap at one and a half
miles for three-year-olds was the feature
of the afternoon's sport, and resulted In
a lucky win for the favorite, Merops, rid
! den by Joe Piggott. The son of Brutus
i was assigned 112 pounds and ruled a 6 to
j 5 favorite. Perhaps just as much money
went in on the ninety-six pounder, (Jim,
j with the Irrational McNlchols in the sad
dle. If the latter rider is honest he should
ibe set down for incompetency, diaries
I Fink, owner of I'lm, gave McNlchols Or
; ders to make every post a winning one.
j While the field was traveling down the
' back stretch at a snail's pace the gay
'â  youth allowed three horses to pass him.
I Once the stretch was reached he began to
ride again, and in a punishing drive was
beaten out but a head by the favorite in
2:3_c.. Olinthus, packing 115 pounds, was
third. Gauntlet, the second choice, ran
disappointingly.
In the opening, two-year-old scramble
Bamboulia, the Puryear D colt, more than
I turned the tables on Flush of Gold. The
latter filly closed favorite, but tired long
before the wire was reached, finishing
i third. Reiff, on Bamboulia, seemed a big
i improvement over Shields, for the colt led
May Gertrude out a length in :48%. Six
i to 1 was laid against the winner, and he
went begging in the ring.
The Duke & Wlshard cast-off Heigh Ho
was installed a lukewarm choice for the
. splint next decided, but Reiff took mat
i ters altogether too easy the- first part and
! was led over the line by Prompto, a 5 to 1
I shot, with Jones in the saddle. Sly came
from seventh position in the stretch, fin
ishing third. Flora Hawk led to the
I stretch, where she "blew up." _ -â¢â 
| Corrlgan's mare Daisy F ruled an odds
| on choice for the mile and a furlong sell
i ing run. and at odds of 2 to 5 won hands
down from Grady. Jennie Reid, with
I Loulller up, ran a close third.
The Cambridge stable's wonder, Crom
i well, had everybody guessing when the
, mile and a sixteenth event came along.
The chestnut horse closed favorite, and
' while he did not bleed failed to show an
atom of speed even with Bullman on his
i back. Piggott, with the leg up on Eddie
! Jones, assumed the front position In the
stretch and in a fierce drive with Castake
and Potente gained the verdict by a head
in 1:47%.
Duke & Wishard's Ailynr. second choice
in the ring, made a scamper of the free
handicap over six furlongs. The Baldwin
entry, La Goleta, had first call in the bet

Track Notes.
The horses oAvned by Doss & Co. were
disposed of at public auction in the pad
dock at Oakland track. The prices realized
were as follows: Hugh Penny, $1250, E.
Corrigan; Don Quixote, $600, E. Corrigan;
Opponent, $625, J. Coffey. Mat Hogan
brought $125 and Orion $150, the latter also
going to the nod of Corrigan.
Starter Jim Caldwell nearly experienced
an attack of acute heart failure yester
day. While looking for the best price in
the ring some one "lifted" his chronom
eter. He reported the fact to Captain
Forcy of the Pinkerton Agency and
walked about in a state bordering on
collapse until it was* discovered that
Charley Quinn had taken the timer in a
joke.
Mike Daly would make a great Santa
Claus. Early in the week, just before de
parting for the East, he presented Bliss
Rucker to Charley Weber, the ex-jockey.
While journeying overland he read that
the horse won a race on Friday, and yes
terday he telegraphed the California
Jockey Club to send him the purse.

and Tobacco.
"High life below stairs'* best expresses
the condition of affairs last evening in
the banquet hall of the Native Sons'
building, where Stanford Parlor No. 76
gave Its high jinks to the delegates to the
Grand Parlor, which will convene in Sa
linas to-morrow and to specially invited
members of the order.
There were present about four hundred,
one-half of that number being delegates.
The programme that was presented by
J. J. Lerman, F. A. Schleicher, John J.
McCarthy, Samuel Shean and J. Green
berg, the social committee of the parlor,
for their entertainment was a lengthy
and pleasing oneâ in fact, the A-ery best
that this parlor has ever arranged at an
affair of this kind. There were nearly
thirty numbers on "the list,'' and while
these were being presented no smoking
was alloAved, nor were any refreshments
served.
D. A. Curtin, president of the parlor,
delivered a short address appropriate to
the occasion, at the conclusion of which
he introduced J. J. German, the chair
man of the committee, who, after ex
pressing the hope that all would enjoy
the hospitality of Stanford Parlor, intro
duced Sheriff Henry S. Martin as the
master of ceremonies.
The first number was by the Stanford
University Glee Club, which rendered sev
eral choice selections; Daniel E. Hanlon
favored with imitations of Henry Irving,
Henry James and John McCullough; then
William J. O'Brien, the sweet singer, ren
dered several vocal selections; T. G. Eg
gert amused the audience with stories
and songs; the Frank Coffin Quartet en
tertained with choice selections, after
which Marshall P. Wilder of the Orpheum
kept the audience in a roar for a quarter
of an hour. Miss Hazel gave an exhibi
tion of fancy dancing; Ogilvie and Lloyd
sang duets; Donald de V. Graham sang
ballads; A. Dayton sang coon songs; and
Louis Steiger gave imitations of Chinese
singers. In the second part there was a
Cakewalk, musical selections by the Stan
ford University Mandolin Club, vocal se
lections by Major A. A. Borllni, John Des
mond and W. H. Brown, banjo duet by
the Howard brothers, club-swinging by
members of the Olympic Club and con
tributions by artists from the local the
aters after the places of amusement
closed.
At the close of the programme a special
committee served pipes, tobacco and
sandwiches and it was near midnight
when the jinks was closed in due form
and with three cheers for the enter
tainers.
All the delegates who were in the city
last night will leave this morning at '9
o'clock by the broadgauge for the con
vention city to remain there until next
Saturday. _____________________________
HARES RAN STRONG
IN THE COLD SNAP
FIRST ROUND OF THE BIG STAKE
FINISHED.
Probable Winners of the Races That
Will Be Run To-Day at Union
Coursing Park.
The crowd of sport-lovers at Union
Park yesterday sought the shelter Of the*
betting ring. The cold and sharp wind
from the north that swept over the pleas
ure ground was not hailed with delight
by those who had left behind their over
coats. The hares showed a marked im
provement in their running, and the sport
was consequently much better than usual.
Although ninety-six dogs contested in the
all-aged stake, the favorites, with few
exceptions, carried off the winning colors.
The first course, between Koolawn and
Morning Glory, was an upset to the
"know-it-alls," who played Koolawn, a
; 2*;2 to 1 shot, to win. Hooper's dog was
seemingly "off her feed." Her perform
ance was very mediocre, considering what
she is capable of doing when fit. Sister
Julia, a dog that belongs to no particular
place on earth, met Mercy May in the
slips. The betting was 10 to 1 in' favor of
Miss May, and it can be safely said that
those who played her "were on to the
pipe." Sister JulFa was not fast enough
to catch a cold on a warm day, and Mercy
May ran unassisted. The judge, immedi
ately after the kill, rode near the betting
ring and declared all bets off. The favor
ites had matters their own way until the
nineteenth course was called, when Sil
ver Lyon, a 3 to Â shot, bowled over Vigi
lant, who ran unsighted for some dis
tance. The twenty-first course jarred the
talent considerably. Lowlander, a strong
favorite at 8 to 1, met the Milo kennel's
Miss Rabbit. It looked like easy money
when Lowlander shot from the slips and
led his opponent fully ten yards to the
hare, but after the turn the brindle dog
had to be content to watch the tall of Miss
Rabbit, who rapidly scored up points on

THAT COURSING CHALLENGE.
The Owner of the Greyhound Motto
Declares That He Has Been
Grossly Misrepresented.
Last Tuesday a challenge appeared in
The Call purporting to have come .from
the hand of Frank A. McComb of West
Side, who is the owner of the greyhound
Motto. The fact that the name of Mr.
McComb was wrongly spelled and that the
intention of the writer was evidently to
injure the good standing in which Mr.
McComb is held by the Union Coursing
Park Association is in Itself an evidence
of guilt on the part of the unscrupulous
and malicious person who wrote tin arti
cle in question. It is pleasing to chronicle,
however, that neither " Mr. McComb nor
the Union Park management will feel in
the slightest the sting that was intended
by the venomous writer to cause pain and
injury to the parties it was aimed at.
The following letter in contradiction to
the challenge which was received sup
posedly from the owner of Motto speaks
for itself: , Â ââ
WEST SIDE, April 20, 1599.
To Sporting Editor Call-Dear Sir: J wish
to state that the challenge issued In The Call
Of April 17 is absolutely false. I knew nothing
of it until lt appeared in the paper. Some
person with a great deal of nerve has put it
ln and forged my name to it 1 nave no
idea of the person that did It. I do not wish
to Insult any one. nor do I wish to do any
thing for which I would be ruled out of the
park, as 1 am sure I would be if .1 had put
that challenge in the paper. Hoping I will
be exonerated from any blame in such a
base act, I remain. "^^"^oMÃ.

Sportsmen were out in number yester

between W. C. Brown and Supervisor

the birds, as afterward developed, were
a strong and speedy lot, but, everything
considered, the men made good scores.
The match was at twenty-five birds, un
known traps, and was won by Brown by
I the narrow margin of one, the score
standing at the end Brown IS, Black 17.
I Brown started badly, losing three out of
j his first five birds, Then he braced and

One year ago Rev. Dr. Dille denounced
ln the strongest language the practice of

accenting a benefit from the racetrack.
l>r. Dille's words were in some quarters
construed as being personal, and a hitter
controversy ensued. Rev. Dr. Coyle ex
pressed the same sentiments as Dr. Dille,

DARING JAIL
DELIVERY NIPPED
BY THE SHERIFF
Brandes and Eslabe
Cleverly Foiled. -
MURDERERS PLAN AN ESCAPE
HACK SAWS AND FRAME FOUND
ON THE LEADER.
An Unknown Woman Smuggles Tools
Into the County Jail and Aids
Prisoners in Their Con
spiracy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway; April 22.
Sheriff O. L. Rogers to-day frustrated
a well-developed conspiracy which had
for its prime object the delivery of two
[ murderers, prisoners at the County Jail,
i ami the success of which might have re
sulted in a wholesale jailbreak.
The leaders in the conspiracy were Wil
liam A. Brandes, convicted of murder in
the second degree for beating to death his
â¢ 13-year-old daughter, Lillian Brandes. and
whose motion for a new trial will be ar-
g ued before Judge Hall next Monday; and
Joaquin Eslabe. the convicted murderer
of Charles Gates, the crippled t..male
vender, whom he beat to death with a
piece of lead pipe.
Eslabe is the instigator and the two
prisoners found a formidable ally in a
simple-minded married woman, whose
name Sheriff Rogers declines to make
public. This woman has frequently vis
: ited Eslabo at the County Jail and she
appeared smitten with the murderer, who
with Brandes, James Qilllgan, the slayer
of Jockey Epperson, and other important
prisoners, occupied the Grand Jury corri
dor during the day time and up to 9
o'clock of evenings.
About ten days ago Sheriff Rogers, his
1 chief jailer. Louis Schoenau, and Deputy
George Tavlor first learned that a con
spiracy- was brewing. This fa. they dis
covered through words dropped by the
leaders in conversation with other pris
' oners. _ ,_.,â _
A few days ago Eslabe' female friend
and ally visited the jail and left a small
package for her jailed lover. She had
frequently brought fruits and delicacies
for him and the package was passed to
the prisoner without examination.
This morning Eslabe and Brandes ap
peared to be In unusually cheerful spirits.
Hints were dropped that reached the
1 Sheriff's ears and an immediate investi
gation resulted. Eslabe was taken Into
his cell and searched. On him were found
' hacksaws, files and a frame. When con
fronted with the evidence the conspirator
; frankly admitted his purpose and his al
lies, confessing that he had sent for the
j tools. He threateningly asserted that he
i "would vet make holes in the County
: Jaii." Th.- delivery was to have been ef
fected to-day, tin. Eslabe remarked to
; Sheriff Rogers and Jailers Schoenau and
Tavlor, who conducted the search, that
they "could not blame him for trying to
escape while the gallows are staring him
lln the face." Eslabe's case is now pend
] ing In the Supreme Court on appeal.
The strictest secrecy was preserved at
the Jail and in the Sheriff's office. In
fact. Chief Jailer Schoenau vigorously de
nied the report of the attempted deliv
ery. Sheriff Rogers, however, though with
i much reluctance, finally verified the story
as given her. with.
"Yes. we have been expecting this,"
I said the Sheriff, "but I felt confident that
we were perfectly able to cope with it.
"We are fully prepared to handle such
matters and were well informed as to the
movements of outsiders. We did wish
to keep the matter quiet until after
i Brandes' case had been disposed of; but
now that it is all out, why, that's all
i there is about it."
Brandes and Eslabe have V now been
placed in solitary confinement and each
: in his separate cell will so remain until
j his case is disposed of. The woman in the
j conspiracy will in all probability be ar
' rested. _____________________________
Fanners' Institute at Haywards.
OAKLAND, April 22.â There was an
1 enthusiastic meeting of farmers and fruit
men at the opera house in Haywards this
' afternoon to arrange for a farmers' insti
tute in Eden Township on May 27. The
institute will be conducted by the agricul
tural department of the State University
under the direction of Professor D. I*.

OAKLAND, Aprl! 22.â J. F. Turner, the
San Francisco real estate deal* who has
figured in numerous deals across the bay
and who was interested in th**- famous
"Nobby" Clark case, to-day filed several
deeds in the Alameda County Recorder's
office covering property in Alameda and

Stayed the Stroke of the Ax.
A ".DA, April 22.â The new Board
'of City Trustees held another caucus
â  last night to discuss prospective
I changes in the appointive offices of the
I city. The Police Department came in
, for the lion's share of the discussion. -One
of the Harmonic Hall contingent urged
that the position of every police officer
he declared vacant on account of the
i force violating the rules of the depart
: ment and being too aggressive in the
: City Marshal's fight. Joseph Forderer,
| who was re-elected a member of the
hoard on the Municipal League ticket,
'. blocked the wholesale slaughter by call
ing attention to an old city ordinance
' which provides that no city officer can he
! removed without being given a hearing.
KILLED BY A
COIL OF ROPE
Peculiar Death of a Laborer
on the Mohican.
OAKLAND. April 22.â Joe Neves, a Portuguese laborer, was killed on the
Mohican, lying off old long wharf, this afternoon. In company with Captain
C. W. Saunders and First Mate E. W. Kelley, Neves was holding on to a
guiderope attached to a yardarm on the vessel, assisting in lowering a
heavy piece of machinery Into the hold. ; ;
For some reason the donkey engine moved, causing a peculiar noise;
which evidently alarmed Neves. Letting go of the guiderope, he Jumped Into
the coil of rope back of him. The yardarm, being thus suddenly released,
swung out, tightening the coil about Neves' body, hurling him against an
iron water tank and then out into the bay at least a hundred and fifty yards.
His dead body was .immediately recovered- and it was found that his left
leg had been broken, also both arms and his back. He was removed to the
Morgue.' An inquest will be held next Monday night. Deceased was aged 32
years and leaves a large family residing on B street, near Louisa, in the
Watts Tract.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 23, 1899.
CITY HALL IS
DECLARED TO
BE TOO SMALL
Prisoners Likely to Be
Roasted Alive.
NO SAFETY FROM FIRE
EVEN PUBLIC RECORDS ARE IN
' GRAVE DANGER.
-
The Mayor Sees Little Hope of
a New Hall' Until City
and County Are
United.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 22.
The Board of Works decided officially
to-day that the City Hall is too small for
the city's business and also that it is very
badly arranged for the convenience of the
public. Mayor Snow's great objection Is
to the entrance, and he declared that in
no other city of even a quarter the size
of Oakland is the entrance to the City
Prison, the Board of Education, the Police
Court, the Mayor's office, the taxpayers'
office and other places where ladies fre
quently have business in one spot. In this
city there is generally a gang of Police
Court loafers and prison frequenters con
gregated around the entrance of the City
Hall, and Mr. Snow has a plan whereby
the police feature could be confined to
Fifteenth street in the rear, leaving the
front free for the city's business.
The Commissioners are anxious to cen
ter all the municipal departments under
one roof, but find that this caanot be
done, and although they roundly condemn
the City Hall, it was the opinion of the
Mayor that no new City Hall will be
built until the consolidation of a city and
county, which be places at ten years in
the future.
City Engineer Clement has be'en re
quested to bring his offloe from the Mac-
Donough building into the City Hall and
occupy the room now held by the Board
of Education. He has measured and finds
that there is much too little space for
the growing requirements of the Engi
neer's office. it is proposed that the Board
of Education shall -share the same rooms
as the City Council. An attempt will be
made to secure a reduction of the rents
for the quarters now occupied by the En
gineer.
The Commissioners called attention to
the fact that the City Hall is an old shack
and that there is not within it a single
fireproof room. So thai in case of fire all
the city records would in all probability
be destroyed, for it has long been con
ceded that the old wooden building would
quickly be totally burned if lire ever got
a good start.
One question that Is appealing to the
Commissioners very forcibly "is the loca
tion of the prisoners. The City Prison is
in the basement of the City Hall. The
cells are old-fashioned and generally con
tain about thirty people. In the event of
a fire the probability is strong that at
least half of the prisoners would be
roasted to death. There have been sev
eral small fires at the hall, which have
been quickly subdued; but there is a gen
eral feeling among the City Hall crowd
that "there will come a time some day"
when things will be different. '

SALVATIONISTS ENTER
JOB PRINTING BUSINESS
AN ADJUNCT TO THE WAR
CRY DEPARTMENT.
Will Compete With Rival Establish
ments on Equal Terms â No
Favors Asked or Given.
The Salvation Army lias decided to en
ter the job printing field, .and the an
nouncement has caused shivers of ap
prehension to begin traversing the spinal j
columns of the employing printers of the
city, while the typestickers are also ex
periencing a feeling of dread. But there
is no reason for either to be alarmed, for
the Salvation print shop is to be run for
revenue only, paying first class wages and
doing first class work. No attempt is to
be made to secure work by offering to do
it cheaper than anyone else as it Is claimed
is done by a certain establishment con
ducted by a religious organization across
the bay. The Salvationists are prepared
to enter into active competition with the
firms al^ady in the field on equal terms,
depending on the excellence of the work
turned out to bring them business. The
circular announcing the entry of the Sal
vationists into the field of job printing,
which has been sent to a large number of
business men within the last few days, is
as follows: . ;.'*â .;. Ty{.y
SAN FRANCISCO. March 15, 1539.
Dear Sir: We desire .to call your atten
tion to the fact that we have opened up a
first-class Job printing establishment in
connection with our War Cry department..
With modern type, experienced workmen
and other facilities, we feel that we can
give you entire satisfaction, both in price
and workmanship. We are certain that our
work in itself will merit your patronage,
yet desire to call your attention to the fact
that all profits accruing from such will be
used to assist in our work on this coast,
which we believe is already too well known
to require further explanation from us.
Trusting that we may hear from you In
answer to this, I remain, yours very sin
cerely, WILLIAM EVANS,
Lieutenant Colonel.
The printing department of the Salva
tion Army is in charge of Charles Dan
ner. Mr. Danner says he proposes to em
ploy only flrst Class men and expects to
pay union wages and in some instances
more. He says:
"The job printing department will be
run on business principles in every re
spect. It will not be conducted on the
lines of the social work of the army at
all. 1 expect to start a solicitor about
next week, and at first will employ one
jobber and one pressman. Later, if the
business warrants it, I will put on more
men. I shall not cater to the cheap class
of trade at all, as there is more money in
doing first class work. None of the print
ers will receive less than the union scale'
of wages, $3 per day, and I expect to pay
more than that in some Instances. I have
no intention or desire to fight the union,
and in this connection I will say that the
majority of job printing firms in this city
are at present employing non-union men,
or at least paying less than union wages.
The union men need have no fear that
our shop will have a tendency to reduce
wages, and I will be only too glad to com
pare payrolls with competing firms at
any time."

the medicine on her, and I stopped using it.
It was indeed very painful. Her skin was all
red and raw, and moisture coming from it all
the time. A perfect stranger to me advised
me' to DM Cuticura remedies. I got Cuti-

they entirely cured her vithin a month. She

and as each side wishes to ho ahead of
the other the battle is not considered done
with by long odds. Chinese who know
the situation thoroughly say that there
will be no more fighting in Fresno, but
that tin battle will be finished in this i
city, and the local police are accordingly
keeping a sharp lookout. There are four
tongs interested In the present difficulty,
and the numbers are about equal. On the
one side Is the Hop Sing tone, with WO
men. and the Bing Songs, with 1600. On
the other the Suey Dins number 1500 and
the Hip Sins are 400 strong.
A number of highbinders arrived in this
city yesterday afternoon; in fact almost I
every train brought in a bunch of them.
The respectable merchants are preparing
for a highbinder war. They seldom go
out into the streets, and never unless
attended by a strong bodyguard. The
fact that the old Chinatown squad has
been moved and men who are practical
ly strangers to Chinatown substituted
tends strongly to embolden the bad ele
ment, and if the warring tongs can raise
sufficient money the fight will be in full
swing within the next forty-eight hours.

entertainment.
Covers were laid for fifty-one in the
handsomely decorated dining hall of the
club, but Prince Poniatowski and Judge
John Garber wore prevented from partici
pating. Nearly all of the prominent offi
cials of the Southern and Central -Pacific
systems were there to meet with the
brightest and foremost legal and business
lights of the community and it proved
quite the swellest function the club has
seen for many a day.
C. P. Huntington occupied the place of
honor at the right of Mr. Mills and Gen

left Senator George C. Perkins and li. E.

In consequence of the practical. If not legal, extinction of the Pacific
Yacht Club, the Inter-Club Yacht Association will consist of five instead of
six clubs this year. But th enthusiasm of the yachtsmen has shown no
abatement.
The Oakland Navy, in charge of a committee consisting of H. G. Hinck
ley (vice commodore of the Oakland Canoe Club), Jules Hartman, Charles
Stewart, P. W. Hurndall and C. L. Taylor Jr., with R. R. L'Hommedleu as
referee, after a year or two of hibernation, has shown signs of renewed
life, and has already hold three races, the first on January 29, the second
on February 26 and the third on. March 12.
Tlie Oakland Canoe Club has prepared an extensive programme, in which
are included six races (or the Mayrisch badge, handicap races for sloops,
mixed races for sloops and canoes, ruises to Tiburon and to the Encinal
Yacht Club house, receptions to visiting yachtsmen and other events.
The San Francisco Yacht Club, the oldest on the Pacific Coast, com
prises In its fleet all the large schooner yachts, such as J. D. Spreckels'
Lurline, E. A. Wiltsee's Aggie. Isador Gutte's Chispa, W. S. Goodfellow's
I.a Paloma tho Kamona, White Wings and Virginia.
The new clubhouse is spacious and convenient: its interior is rapidly
being made comfortable and attractive, the billiard-room having recently
been partitioned off, lined and decorated. â
The San Franciscos have departed from the traditions of the local yacht
clubs by electing a ladyâ Mrs. J. W. Sperryâ to full membership, and an ap
plication from a second lady has been received. inasmuch, however, as
the wives; sisters and friends of members have always been freely admitted
a* 1 guests to tho clubhouse, their election as members can make very little
difference. ; â *.-â 
The board nf directors for 1839 comprises Dr. T. L. Hill, commodore;
Dr. V. P.' Buckley, vice commodore; James Kitterman, port captain; E.
<*. Bartlett, corresponding secretary; w. G. Morrow, financial secretary;
Robert P. Hoguei treasurer, and J. M. Punnett, measurer. R. B. Hogue
left the city a few days ago on the steamship Mariposa, on his way to
Australia, where he will remain for several months; the club will thus lose
the services of a most efficient and energetic treasurer for this season. Sec

Of members having swollen to such proportions that a proposal to limit Its
numbers has been seriously entertained. Notwithstanding its increasing
size the club Is as free from strife and dissension as it has always been.
Having a regular and ample income it is able to indulge in a larger ex
penditure than any of the clubs on the bay, and its entertainments are al
ways marked by an abundance of good cheer and a spirit of frank cama
raderie.
The officers for 1599 are Carl "Westerfeld, commodore; W. H. Toepke.
vice commodore; T. L. Miller, secretary; C. L. Barrett, treasurer, and J.
H. Keefe, port captain by election of his fellow members and commissary
general by universal acclamation.
The Corinthian fleet will shortly receive a notable additionâ a yacht, 65
feet over all, which is being built by Frank Stone for H. Simpklns, owner
of the Mistral. The new boat will be the largest yawl-rigged yacht on the
bay and will be luxuriously equipped.
The California Yacht Club, under the command of Commodore Allen
M. Clay, is showing great activity, having doubled its number of active
members since New Year's day. Commodore Clay has bven thoroughly
overhauling his newly acquired sloop, which he has christened Pactolus,
and has fitted her up quite handsomely. The members bad an entertain
ment last night at their clubhouse on Oakland Creek and this morning will
join the Corinthians In the opening cruise of the season. The united fleets
will piesent a pretty sight as they sail along the water front in squadron,
under signal' from the sloop Aeolus, flagship of the Corinthian Yacht Club.
The officers of the California Yacht Club for 1899 are: Allen M. Clay,
commodore; A. C. Lee, vice commodore; E. N. Walter, treasurer; R. L.
Eames, secretary; C.-E. Clark, port captain, and .1. J. Sherry, measurer.
The Encinal Yacht Club has rebuilt the annex which was destroyed by
fire on the morning of January 2, but is not yet quite ready to name an
opening day. Its officers are: P. S. Teller, president; Henry M. Lands

commodore; John F. Ward, vice commodore; Dr. C. L. Tisdale, port captain,
and F. C. Youngberg, measurer.

its programme includes cruises to Belmont Slough, San Francisco, Red
wood City and Napa. The fleet in commission numbers "two schooners, six
sloops, two catboats and three launches.
The programme of the San Francisco Yacht Club includes half a dozen
hops at the clubhouse, an open regatta, cruises to Pi taluma drawbridge.
Paradise Cove, McNears Landing, Marin Islands, YaliÂ» jo, Napa and up the

The Corinjthian programme embraces cruises, to all the above-named
places and also to Suisun; a chowder cruise and a clambake or two; a
small yacht regatta, races for rowboats, and the usual games at Corinthian
Cove. Once -in the seasonâ on Atigust 5 and G â the San Franciscos and
Corinthians will venture into' the unfamiliar waters of the lower bay, cruis
ing to Belmont Slough to meet their brethren of the South Bay Yacht
Club.
The opening jinks were given yesterday by the Californias at their club
house on Oakland Creek and by the Corinthians at Tiburon. At the lat
ter place Port Captain J. H. Keefe s arrangements for mitigating the pangs
j of hunger and assuaging the horrors of thirst were, as thorough as usual.
The entertainment succeeding the dinner was funny enough to provoke the
laughter of a Trojan horse and warm enough to melt the heart of an Ice

4RS. AD^UR^u K/\UTZ, Wife of the Admiral cf the Philadelphia
Is it the bravest thing to run away
with our husbands to the field of bat
tle or does it require more courage to
remain at home?
That is a difficult question.
I know a woman, a young mother,
whose sense of duty augmented the
force of her generous heartâ and if
ever a woman deserved a medal for
courage it is she.
The first transport was leaving for
Manila. This wife had listened to the
last call to arms with heroic calmness,
while her heart beat time to the noisy
drum. It was her duty to comfort the
old mother with "O, he'll come home
all covered with laurels, and we shall
be bo proud of him, and baby will be
old enough to say papa then."
The soldier-husband stood at the
gate; the mother lifted baby up high
for the last kiss, and her brave voice
did not falter when she said "God bless
you, dear. Come back to us."
Her smile was the last that greeted
him; her hand was the last to wave
good-by, and the first to strengthen
the feeble old mother.

MRS. LIEUT. E. L. BE AG}., Wife of Lieut Beach,. U. S. S Baltimore.
To "live ; in a. hostile city is by no
means the greatest sign "pf female
as the encouragement and stimulus of a
good woman in his home. Behind every
successful man is the influence of some
good woman. We sometimes say that
women know very little of business, and,
judged from the business standards of
men, this is technically true. .
The reason of this is simple enough, in
that the one it* by his very creation fitted
for business and then trained; the other
is not. But the most powerful,, if silent,
factor in the world of. business to-day,
nevertheless, is the influence of woman.
She it is who stands behind the man, In
fusing new hope, new courage, and point
ing the way to a new beginning, and often
by her Instinct succeeding In settling im
portant matters in a single moment where
days of planning along business lines have
brought only failure and deeper gloom.
How often the women of this land have
been the means of averting business dis
asters or the multiplying of failures with
further complications the world will never
know. But there are men who know it.
It may sound smart to some ears to say
that "a woman breaks a man," and, alas!
that it should be true in some cases. But
it Is also true that more often woman
makes a man. We read and hear of the
former, and sometimes, because of certain
conditions of circumstances, we are In
clined to exaggerate their number. But
that Is only because of the noise they
make. Happy marriages are silent, and
far outnumber the unhappy ones.
Whenever we hear of an unhappy mar
riage we should always remember that
there are thousands and thousands of
happy unions of which we never hear.
Where love, is kept alive in a home un
happiness has a hard time getting a foot
hold, and as the good women In the world
far exceed the others, a young man
stands a pretty good chance of getting
one of the right kindâ that is, if he can
give so far as any man can glye, a pretty
good equivalent for what he asks.

the quiet mustering of the troops, the

WJjat Presidents Cost.
PRESIDENTS "come high, but we
have got to have them." It costs us
5114.565 a year for a chief executive.
His salary is $50,000 and "found," as
our Western neighbors say. The Presi
dent's finding is rather comprehensive,
covering about every possible require
ment of a family. His private secretary,
the clerks, 'doorkeepers, messengers and
steward, and three other servants, cost
us $33,865 a year. Then there is a con
tingent fund of $8000 a year, which the
President may use according to his dis
cretion.
In furniture and repairs to the White
House the sum of $16,000 more, to be used
by the direction of the President, is pro
vided by the nation and is always ex
pended. For fuel alone $3000 is allowed,
and for necessary repair's to the green
house there is $4000.
Altogether the Presidential "fading" a
annually amounts â¢to the snug sum or
$64,865, nearly $15,000 a year more than
his salary. The two aggregate $114,865.
This is an imposing aggregate, but it is
small compared with other Presidents.
The President of the French Republic re
ceives as salary $120,000 a year, $32,450 for
contingent purposes and a handsome
house, rent free. So we get our Presi

THROUGH the kindness of F. W.
Peters, secretary of the Ylgorit
Powder Company, I am enabled to
present to the leaders of The Sun
day fall one of the strangest de
cisions ever handed down by any
court in the world.
Mr. Peters, as an exporter of powder
and a heavy Importer of Indian stuffs and
condiments, is in correspondence with
many of the great Fas* Indian houses.
Among the lot none are more prominent
'hat th* old and highly respectable firm
of Manockjee, Poonjeajee A Co. of Bom
bay.
During the month of January, 1898, my
friend received a letter from the Bombay
house to the effect that a certain order
was canceled on account of a disastrous
flre which had destroyed their principal
warehouse, It was stated that the firm
was ir. no way involved, but that it was
necessary that a friendly suit be insti
tuted in ll " Indian courts to deride which
member or members of the firm should
be held responsible for the conflagration
which had cost the house a loss of at
least 2,'ttO/OO rupees .51 .000 .000).
It. was stated in the letter that the fire
was caused by the overturning of a lamp
In the counting-house and communicated
to the warehouse through the agency of
a cat.
It was quite easy to understand that a
Are might have been caused by the over
tures- of a -.:;, In the counting-room,
and even that It might have been carried
into the warehouse by a cat. After
sifting the correspondence the curious
story may be told as follows:
The house of Manockjee Poonjeajee &
Co. is one of the oldest in all India. Its
members are all Parsees. Now to the
Occidental this fact may seem very insig
nificant, but not so to one who has ever
resided In the Orient. For in all the four
quarters of the globe there are no greater
merchants than this most peculiar sect.
The wary Turk, the sly Chinese and the
clever Armenian all nave their claims as
shrewd mercantile men. but none should
be mentioned In the same breath with the
Parsoe; he is the acknowledged king of
merchants.
One of the peculiarities 0 their busi
ness methocjs is the fact that all property
owned by a firm must be carefully des
ignated, and. If possible, segregated, In
order that if a loss occur through the
negligence of any member of the firm the
rest may not .-differ for the faults of the
others.
To give an example, one member of the
firm desired to take a flyer at the pow
der trade, the other members of the
combination considered it an unsafe busi
ness; so it was agreed that the house go
into the business, but that the individual
who lad proposed this innovation was to
be responsible for any damage that might
accrue hi case of explosion not due to
the negligence of the other members. In
order that this particularly bold mem
ber might be properly recompensed for
his great risk, he was to have one full
half if the profits from the sale of the
powder, while the threo timid members
were to divide the remaining one-half.
So much for the business methods of
our Bombay merchants. Now for the
strange tale of the cat.
The ancient house of Manockjee, Poon
jeajee & Co. is situated in Borah Bazar
Street Fort. Bombay, and it is claimed
by the members of the present firm that
their ancestors have carried on the same
business, with a few modifications to
meet the necessities of the European
trade, for more centuries than the United
States has been known to the map of the
world. The firm is made up of four
partners, and their counting room and
one of their warehouses are in this build
ing. This particular storeroom contains
only the silks and other precious stuffs
for which the house is noted In trade all
over the world.
One day there strayed Into the count
ing house where the four sedate and dig
nified merchants sat smoking their pipes
in the solemn silence so common to the
prosperous Oriental merchant a pretty
white kitten. Little attention was paid
to pussy until she had made the round of
the room, rubbed her soft fur against
the leg of each member of the firm and
finally walked demurely over to the
great strong box which stood in one cor
ner. Here she paused for a moment and
seemed to critically examine its fasten

with the construction of the safe, and

stretched herself comfortably beside the
door and began to purr a little cat-like
song, looking at the four 'partners with
an expression which seemed to say:
Now, gentlemen, you may rest perfect
ly secure. ,L will assume all the respon
sibility of this business myself."
"Brothers!" exclaimed one of the party
"this is surely a good omen. Unbidden
this pretty lit. c creature comes in to our
place of business; without ceremony she
introduces herself to each member of the
firm. Next she examines our property to
see If we are solvent and in good standing

strange form? Let us adopt the little
stranger and give It a home in the great
house of ' Manockjee, Poonjeajee & Co
Should we refuse her shelter it- is pos
sible we offend the Deity. What say you
my good brothers?" '
Solemnly the remarks were considered
by the other three partners. Finally one
said: "Brother, what you say may be
true. You are well known foryour ' wis

tional university: you have also listened
to the wise teachings of the mysterious
men who live on the mountains. But
first let me ask you one question. Is this
request that we adopt this strange visitor
the result of your occult training, or
simply a playful thought? You say It
seems a good omen and that it may be a
message from the other world. Why these
odd thoughts?" ~_H_9-|

from all four pipes. "Brothers," he re

THE WAT TO TELL FORTUNES WITH CARDS.
IF there Is one thing more than an
other that fascinates women, and
men, too, for the matter of that, it is
having their fortunes told. What
like hearing is that "the dark gentleman
with the black eyes is dying for love of
them," that "a large fortune will shortly
be left them," or something equally de
lightful. They do not shrink, or pretend
not to, from listening to prognostications
of evil, but on the whole are naturally
more inclined toward the sybil who
promises them a rosy future. Fortune
telling by cards ls now the absorbing
pastime of certain smart sets of society,
and many a maiden is achieving a sur
prising popularity because she can read
cleverly the mystic signs and symbols
shown "by the black and red spots.
The systems in vogue are the Parisian,
the Italian, the Vingt et Un and the Et
teilla We propose to describe and follow
the Parisian as being the least compli
cated It is the system most frequently
met With, and is familiar to the gypsies
of all nations as the "Sevenfold."
It may be remembered- that no small
cards are. necessary for card-laying; the
value of the cards is rated thus: Ace,
highest, then king, queen, knave, ten,
nine eight and seven the lowest.
The general character of the suits is
aS Cl u o bsÂ°^t S and highest, and denote every
thing that is good and lucky; Whatever
their position or surroundings, they pre
sage good fortune, and no environment of
'evil can alter this altogether-
Hearts are next In good odor; they de
note love, kindness, family affections,
pleasure and the genialities and beauties
of life, but they may be tempered by rel
ative cards and untoward situations.
Diamonds signify quarreling, opposition,
hindrance and every possible drawback
of a militant character.
Spades presage sadness, illness, loss of
money and reputation and death.
These are the general characteristics of
the four suits; it must be' clearly under
stood that the best cards may be modi
fied by the circumstances of their posi
tions. Happily, too, the worst cards are
capable of improvement in the same way.
For example, the king of hearts may be
cited as a man of good fortune, open
heat red and open-handed, and endowed
with plentiful means to indulge his gener
ous qualities, but if the card be drawn
upside down it signifies that all his good
luck will be of short duration, , that his
very good qualities will be the cause of
his ruin. If he be placed (in dealing out
the cards) between two lesser cards of
the same suit, he may lose his source of
income, his friends or his reputation, ac
cording to their Individual significance. It
is necessary, therefore, to weigh very

to sustain a great loss. From out this
ominous cloud there came a beautiful
white dove, which I read, means peace
and prosperity after the misfortune.
When I awoke this little white kitten was
Now to explain the proper laying of a
hand.
Choose out the thirty-two cards, which
include eight of each suitâ the cards
which we have already Indicatedâ taking
ace for highest and seven for lowest
value; shuffle and cut them with the left
hand, if you are operating for yourself,
or cause it to be done with the left hand
of the person concerned, if you are op
erating for another. Perhaps for the sake
of clearness it will be best to speak
throughout as though the operator were
the Individual whose fortune was being
Bought
Cut and turn up a card to represent
yourself during the transaction; then
shuffle and deal the cards into two
packets of sixteen cards' each and choose
one of the packets for the fortune. The
first card of this packet which you turn
up must be laid aside; it is known as
"the surprise." and will be wanted later.
Range the cards In a neat semicircle
before, you; If your representative card
(we will call It "the representative")
does not turn up in the packet chosen
you must repeat this process until it
does; If by any chance it should be
drawn first as "the surprise" you must
equally repeat the process until the fif
teen cards are spread before you, in
cluding the representative.
From the representative you proceed
to count seven, and thus light on the
first ' card to influence your fortune;
you must consider first its simple sig
nificance and then its relative significance
as influenced by the cards on either side
of it. ;
When the meaning of this card has
been thoroughly investigated you can
count on to the nest seventh card, al
ways remembering to count from left to
right; it is rather a good plan to draw
a card that has been investigated a lit
tle above the exact line of your semi
circle, or you may use counters or scraps
of paper to show which cards have al
ready been treated' as seventh cardsâ in
the latter case do not put the counters on
the cards, but opposite them, on the outer
edge of the table, for, though the card
as a simple seventh card has been Inves
tigated, it still has Its significance and
relative effect on the others.
Readers must understand that every
card has a precise and definite individual
meaning, with which, if we would be
good cartomancists, It is absolutely ne
cessary to tax the memory. We propose
in a future article to give a complete list
of these meanings, but for the present we
must speak as If our readers were al
ready conversant with them.
. Let us take the queen of hearts as the
representative. She. stands for a loving
and attractive woman, hut her position
at the moment beside the knave of ' dia
monds signifies that she ought to beware
of an unfaithful servant or â¢ inferiorâ
possibly of a soldier boy who has it in
rubbing its back against my robe. Now
take the strange circumstance, or chain
of circumstances, as you will, I have
nothing more to say."
"Well," said another member of the
house, "I am quite willing to admit that
his power to give her annoyance. For
tunately the nine of clubs on her other
side points at unexpected money resources
which may extricate her from difficulty.
She may buy off her tormentor (a very
unwise proceeding, we submit) or other
wise by pecuniary means rid herself of
his influence.
Counting seven cards from the repre
sentative we reach the ten of diamondsâ
this is a journey. The seven of clubs and
the seven of hearts on either side denote
special prosperity both in money matters
and the affectionsâ the journey will be
both profitable and pleasant.
The next seventh card is the queen of
spades, a widow or elderly womanâ her
influence is not likely to be friendly, but
it is. in this case, counterbalanced by the
ten and eight of hearts (the suit of the
representative and consequently svmpa
thctic); the ten signifies satisfaction after
annoyance, the eight a young and friend
ly relative to the representative.
We may conclude that mischief or hin
drance contemplated by the elderly widow
woman is put a stop to by the young con
nection, a blonde person, by-the-by, and
that great relief and satisfaction ensues.
Proceeding to the ace of clubs we have
good news; but the seven and ten of
spades proclaim it to be transitory and
soon turned to mourningâ there is even a
suspicion of shame in the transaction but,
luckily, this will be found to be a false
alarm.
The king of hearts and the knave of
clubs side by side are two persons who
play a strong part in the fate of the rep
resentativeâthe king is blonde and prob
ably a relation, or perhaps an old and In
timate friend: the knave is dark, ener
getic and quick at seizing an opportunity;
the nine of diamonds on the other side
foretells family talk and interest evoked
by the circumstance of the two men's in
fluence on the representative, and points
at difference of opinion. However, as may
be very clearly seen, the next step from
the king to the representative is a mar
riage, and the fact of the suit being sym
pathetic is of the best augury, and closes
this hand, for, as it will be seen, any
further choice of- the seventh card would
only repeat the operation on the old lines.
We have given our explanation as
shortly as possible, but any expert who
cares to go more in detail into the
matter can easily amplify the meanings
derivable from the "sevenfold" methodâ
for. instance, In the hand before us, the
young or energetic lover (or "influencer")
has for seventh card the deceitful servant
or inferior, whose machinations the rep
resentative was called upon to meet earli
er In "the" day. â  The significance of such
relative points is simply inexhaustible,
and can only be brought out by experi
ence and practice.

as the animal. seems part of our brother's
dream, we really have no right to turn lt
away. Suppose, as has been suggested,
we take the little thing, and in order that
the good or ill-fortune lt may bring be
equally divided, we will consider It one of
the assets of the firm. Now, how shall we
divide the ownership of the animal?"
"Oh, well!" exclaimed the others, "we
will follow the regular precedent of our
people. You, Manockjee. may claim the
left foreleg; I will take the right, and so
on til! the cat is equally divided. Is this
arrangement satisfactory to all?"
There being no objection to this mode
of distribution, lt was so agreed. The
bookkeeper was called into the counting
house and the ownership of the cat was
duly entered on the books of the firm as
one of its assets, each quarter of the ani
mal being designated as the property of
some individual member of the firm.
All went well with the house of Manock
jee, Poonjeaiee & Co. for a year or so. and
pussy became a great favorite with the
whole household. It was often remarked
by different members that they had cer
tainly made no mistake when they adopt
ed the stray little kitten, for surely never
for centuries had the great house been
so prosperous. Trade with the West had
almost doubled. Connections had been
established in parts of North and South
America, all of which were .successful.
Yes, there could be no mistake, the kit
ten had been a harbinger of good luck.
Some time during the month of De
cember, 1897, while puss was playing In
the street in front of the store its atten
tion was distracted by some little moving
object and it did not notice a bullock
cart coming from an opposite direction.
In a moment poor kit was under the
heavy wheels and before lt could extri
cate itself one white paw was crushed
and broken. The accident was witnessed
from the store by two members of- the
firm, who rushed wildly into the' street
to save their pet.
They carried the suffering cat Into the
counting room and carefully examined
Its Injuries, it was found that the bones
of the left foreleg were broken and that
the animal was in great pain. "We must
send for a doctor," said one. "Of course,"
was the quick response of all the others.
"But first let us consider whose portion
of the cat has been injured."
This was easily settled. The left fore
leg of the cat belonged to Manockjee, so
it was the duty of Manockjee to send for
the physician and foot the bill.
A doctor was accordingly sent for and
did all In his power to relieve the suffer
ings of the injured animal. The leg was
wrapped in bandages soaked in turpentine
liniment, and regularly each day the doc
tor made his professional call at the great
house to hasten the recovery of the mas
cot. But it is no easy matter to weld a
broken bone when a cat is the patient.
Pussy would put her foot to the ground
once in a while and undo all the work of
her doctor friend.
In the early part of January, 1898, the
cat was walking about over the tables and
desks of the counting-room when she
overturned a lighted lamp. The flame
from the lamp ignited the turpentine with
which the bandages were soaked, and
pussy flew in terror through the counting
room, into the warehouse. The agony of
the burning bandage about the leg kept
the poor beast going at top speed, evi
dently hoping to And relief in some of the
snug corners among the bales of silk.
where she had taken many a quiet nap
on other occasions. Before help could be
summoned the great warehouse with its
valuable contents was in flames, and three
hours after only the big iron safe marked
the spot where once stood the old. old
house of Manockjee, Poonjeajee & Co.
The partners took their loss with all the
stoical forbearance of the confirmed fa
talist. All things were ordained in the be
ginning. This was merely a decree of
fate. So they bowed deferentially to fate
and calmly proceeded to rebuild upon the
ruins. BPW
But now came the Important question of
settling for loss.
Who was at fault? A business meeting
of the firm was held and it was soon de
cided by the other thro" partners that the
whole damage was caused by the burning
bandage wrapped about the left foreleg .if
the cat. That left foreleg was the indi
vidual and separate property of Manock
jee, which made decision an easy matter.
Of course Manockjee was responsible for
the destruction of the warehouse. ! There
was no room for doubt.
Although Manockjee did not dispute
this assertion outright, still he asked for
time to reflect before assuming the entire
responsibility.
At last he asked his partners If they
would object to a friendly suit in the
courts to decide for a certainty just
where the blame should be lodged. "In
this manner." said he, "we may settle the
matter for all time and it will leave no
room for hard feelings."
This was agreed to. with the following
somewhat strange result:
The case was presented fairly and with
out prejudice. Manockjee had retained
one of the brightest pleaders before the
Indian bar, and through his shrewd ef
forts the Judge handed down the follow
ing remarkable decision:
A cat being owned severally by
four men, each being proprietor of
a designated section of the animal,
overturned a lamp and set fire to
a bandage on the left foreleg. The
cat ln fright ran into the ware
house and communicated the flre
to the goods stored therein.
Held, that the owner of the sec
tion of the cat which included the
bandaged leg is not responsible for
the damage caused by the flre, be
cause the three other owners, pro
prietors of the three other legs,
were guilty of contributory negli
gence in that It was by the assist
ance of the legs owned by them
that the cat was enabled to run
into the warehouse and spread the
flames. Judgment for defendant.

Ex-Superior Judge Sanderson was asked
his opinion of the decision of the learned
Indian Judge. He said:
"I quite agree with his Lordship. It wu

"Contributory negligence is an expres
sion rather hard to understand; it does
not always mean exactly what it says.
However." the other partners were guilty
of contributory negligence in this in
stance.
"I read the decision in one of the nu
merous foreign legal journals a short
time ago, but it was only a synopsis of
the judgment and at the time I considered
it simply a legal joke. But now that I
come to think of it the article was in an

same case were presented to one of our
local courts the result would have been
the same except, possibly, the Judge
might have been tempted to throw the
whole thing out of court. Still, if the
ownership of the cat were entered on the
books of the firm, with the segregation of
the property as here represented, it would
probably become the painful duty of the
court to listen to the case.

The Pride of Genius.

men of real genius are always

jLJL examples as proofs of the truth of
this statement. When Mirabeau was dy

head carefully, for it is the most remark
able head in all France."
Michael Angelo wrote In 15-42: "All the
differences between me arid Pope Julius
arose from the fact that Raphael and
Bramante were jealous of me and tried
to overthrow me. Yet everything that
Raphael knows about art he learned from
me.";
Rossini addressed some of bis letters to
his mother as follows: "To "Mrs. Rossini,

Finally. Schopenhauer, when he was
asked where he would like to be buried,
replied: "The place does not matter, as
posterity will know well enough where

These are certainly striking examples
in some respects, but it would not be dif
ficult to find others quite as striking of
real men of genius who were noted for
their modesty. After all, the entire mat

True Detective Story.
Last week came the story of the arrest
for forgery of the Rev. George R. Parrlsh.
paster 'if the First Congregational Church
of Marshalltown, lowa, as told by the
Pink' i detectives. Now, there is noth
ing particularly strange In the arrest of
a man for forgery; it Is a daily item of
news, and so common an occurrence in a
great detective agency as to hardly call
for the most ordinary attention, but here
was a case that even stirred the cold, pro

SHE following are the reasons for
the theory that the Garden of
Edon is at or near Seychelles. I
could even put it at Praslin, a
small isle twenty miles north of
Mahe.
Allow that Genesis Is not allegorical,
that Eden, its garden, its two trees, did
exist on this earth. Eden is a district,
the garden is a spot chosen ln that dis
trict, the trees were actual trees, im
bued for a time with spiritual qualities;
these trees, the bush, the ark. the taber
nacle and temple differed nothing from
the same things in the world except
for the time during which they were
spiritually consecrated or set apart for
manifestations of God. or Satan. God's
consecration made things which were
equally clean, clean. and unclean; there
fore I see no reason for doubting that
God did sot apart the two trees to be
one if Life, the other of Knowledge; or
that God when these two trees had ful
filled their purpose should have rele
gated them back to their former ordin
ary tree position. We see this in the
way the temple is no more than another
building; in the way the Philistines and
Titus and Nebuchadnezzar carried off
the holy things of God which at one
time it was death to touch. I therefore
maintain that there Is no reason to
doubt that two trees of the earth
were used as mystical or sacramental
trees In Eden's garden, or that they
Were destroyed when they had fulfilled
their mission; they were, I think, rele
gr. ted back to their position as trees.
Allowing this, what was the tempta

wonder what would be the effect of

must place ourselves in man's position,

by his belly's appetite; lie could desire
no carriages, dress or jewels; he had
no one to be spiteful to, to bo jealous

could be curious; he was as a child,

Different Aliases.
"Parrlsh." "Thompson" and "Aiken" are
some of the names under which the ar
rested man has been known, with likely
more to appear when he shall tell the en
tire truth of the strange story of his life.
"Parrish." "Rev. Dr. George R. Parrish,"
is the title which appears in the record of
his arrest for forgery. And this record,
as given out by the detectives, tells of the
thrre years' chase necessary to capture
him.
"All criminals come to the detectives
who wait." said the elder Plnkerton years
ago. "Criminals will talk, and they will
continue their methods until some day
they make a slip and reveal themselves.
The slightest cue is sufficient for their de
tection If you only have time and patience
enough to abide lt."
Th!s has been true in the case of Par
rish. for the clew that has been followed
to his arrest was a slender one, and the
arrest did not come until three and a
quarter years after the commission of
the particular crime with which he la

man increases the doors by which wo
can be tempted. The temptation was
in its result distrust of God, a feeling
that God withheld something from man.
In man is implanted by nature the
spirit of Inquiry. We all know this:
tell a child not to open a certain book,
he lmmediatl has an immense long
ing to open that book, which he would
not have noticed if he had not been for
bidden to touch it. You can test it
yourself: leave a dozen lozenges on
your table, tell a child not to eat them,
let the child see them constantly, tell
him only once, and add to your telling
that If he eats something unknown to
him will happen. Keep treating the
child kindly, so that he will not fear
you; some day you will find eleven loz
engesâat least I think so. Therefore
I think the forbidding of the tree was
even to our reason a fair test to man.
and that the very fact of this distrust
and forgetfulnees of God was virtually
a communion with Satan! a sacrament
with Satan: a. mystical eating, though
material, which led to Satan communi
cating or inoculating man with evil,
poisoning, tainting him.
Now, with respect to the other tree,
the Tree of Life, there is no reason to
doubt that man often had ate of
it; before his banquet on the forbidden
tree man had communed with God,
when he named the animals, etc., and
there is every probability he did eat of
the Tree of Life. I do not go into de
tail on this, for you know the Scriptures
and you know what Is written of the
Bread of Life, the fruit of the Tree of
Life, etc., which eventually, In the last
chapter of Revelation, appears again
alone, not with the- Tree of Knowledge;
therefore, I think man often partook
of the Tree of Life in the garden. When
he had eaten of thÂ« Tree of Knowledge,
he was prevented. from so doing, for he
had acquired Â»*â¢ taint from thus eating,
which, if he had after eaten of the Tree
of Life, would have given him Immor

have mixed God with Sata.i ln their at

I am now rebating to you how these
thoughts first struck me and in the
order in which they did.
Well, I thought there were two trees
â actual trees which had been sacra
mental, and had ceased to be so; and In
Praslln, near Seychelles, and only there
in the whole world, Is a magnificent
tree, curious beyond description, called
the Prince of the Vegetable Kingdom;
it is unique in Its species, and on earth
â the Laodicean Seychellarum, or Coco
di Mir. This, I believe, was the Tree
of Knowledge. I then thought if the
one tree is to be found, so Is the other,
and this I think is the Artocarpus In
clsa, or bread fruit; it Is a humble
tree, of no great distinction, yet to an
observer It is as unique in its kind and
among trees as the other. This last
tree is only found in the Indian Ocean.
It is a life-sustaining tree, and, like the
other, it is full of Scriptural types. :
Having thought that these were the
two trees, then the question arose,
Where was the Garden of Eden? And
'first came the Information that Sey
chelles is of granite, and all other Isles
out here are volcanic, granite being the
more ancient formation. â¢ Then the Rev.
Ib Bury mentioned casually that the
verse Genesis ii:10, could be read that
the four rjvers flowed Into Eden, not
out of It. I have been at the sources
of Euphrates, Tigris, etc., and unless
the rivers were forced to flow back
ward no spot could agree to a central*
basin in those lands, while a flood does
Then began a long and not a hopeful
chase. The Rev. Mark Thompson had
disappeared and the name vanished from
ministerial circles. But the detectives
were "sure he would remain in the minis
try, and in that channel they looked for
him. Thorough inquiry was put on foot,
with the result eft learning that the hunt
ed man was born in Kewanee, 111.,' and
had been admitted to the bar in Iowa;
that he had been a newspaper reporter,
had practiced law, had been Prosecuting
Attorney at Wichita. Kan., and a little
more than years ago had become a
minister of the Congregational church.
He had been a "rolling stone,"- and was
possessed by an uneasiness that kept him
moving from place to place.
From church to church and from one
religious society to another the detectives
went without encouraging results. Sev
eral times they received a "tip" that the
Rev. Mark Thompson was at such a
place, going under such a name. Off would
go a detective, shadow the innocent object
of suspicion, inquire into his past and
learn that be was not Mark Thompson.
Then would come a report from some
other place, or from two or more other
places, and the detectives wuld hurry to
investigate them, without the desired re
sult.
There are many perfectly honest and
upright ministers In half a dozen States

Piling Up Forgeries.
Mark Thompson could not be found.
Days became weeks, weeks became
months and the months piled into years.
But the patience of the successful detec
tive Is without limit and he never rests.
Clews were sought and, the search con
tinued. Other eases were being attended
to, but as the several detectives Went
back and forth from one end of the land
to the other, were at scores of hotels in
as many towns, met criminals, brother
detectives, old and casual acquaintances,
not change features of 10,000 feet high.
So I took the rivers Euphrates as Eu
phrates, on which is Babylon, and
Hlddekel as Tigris, on which is Nineveh
(vide Daniel). They meet and flow Into
the Persian Gulf.
Babylon oppressed Israel; Nineveh
oppressed Israel. Required two other
rivers - connected with oppression of
Israel.
The question of whether ever a river
came down the Valley of Jordan Into
the Rod Sea is one which has been
much discussed. That an immense
crevasse exists from the source of the
Jordan to the Red Sea is the case; the
depression of the Dead Sea is the diffi
culty; the ravines of Kedron and Gihon
are very deep.
Taking my ground spiritually, and
the similarity of the name Gihon with
the brook of Jerusalem, I think that
they are the same.
The Pison, or Nile, flowed into the
Red Sea; the Gihon, or Gihon Brook,
flowed into the Red Sea, joined, flowed
down, met the Euphrates and Tigris,
united near Socotra, and the soundings
shown end in a deep basin 2600 fathoms
deep, which is close to Seychelles. Cush
is written In margin for Ethiopia. Cush
was son of Nlmrod*; his land was prob
ably near Babylon, now Bab el Mandeb.
Perlm means Bab (gate) el (of) Mandeb
(the world). .
Pison means overflowingâ the Nile
overflows. Egypt oppressed Israel. The
Nile is believed now to flow Into the
Red Sea; the Blue Nile encompasses
Cod jam, a province of Abyssinia, in
which there is gold. 'Havllah. son of
Joktan, son of Shorn, went with Sheba

they never ceased making inquiries after
Mark Thompson, or, rather, the man who
had been known by that name.
Finally, In October, 1897, the detectives,
through the remarkable Instincts of. their
profession, were satisfied that they bad
at least touched the trail of the man they
were after. A forged draft for $900 came
Into their hands.
"That draft was written by the Rev.
Mark Thompson," said the keen-eyed de
tective expert into whose hands it came.
It was compared with the Sandwich forg
ery, and the comparison showed that the
two had apparently been made by the
same hand.
The .500 forged draft had been offered
to a Watertown (Wis.) bank by a young,
well 'appearing, nervous, clerical looking
man, who had stated that he was the
Rev. Edward 10. Aiken. The draft was
refused, and shortly afterward a similar
instrument was offered by the same man
to a bank at Elkhorn, Wis., and was not
cashed. -.*?"-*,:â¢â 
Trailing His Forgeries.
"Where is the Rev. Edward E. Aiken?"
asked the detectives, but he had as com
pletely disappeared as had the Rev. Mark
Thompson. Yet the search was contin
ued, but the combined Revs. Thompson
arid Aiken moved about as rapidly as
did the detectives, and though clew after
c'.ew was exhausted the hunted forger
was not found.
Then cameâ only a few weeks agoâ the
result of patience and knowledge of the
fact that "criminals, as a rule, continue
their '.rick.-;." Thompson-Alken continued
his hypocrisy and forgery, and unwit
tingly made a clew that has led to his
Imprisonment for the Sandwich forgery.
Another forgery came into Lie hands of
erally connected with Abyssinia, so I
think Pison is Nile.
Gihon means "bursting forth"; the
brook Gihon is on the southern side of
Jerusalem; it meets Kedron and flows,
when it does flow, to the Salt Sea (Dead
Sea), by the "Valley of Fire; it is To

ing to be. written by James Lee Barton,
treasurer of the American Board of Com
missioners for Foreign Affairs,- recom
mending the Rev. Dr. George R. Parrish
to. tic deacon ..of a Congregational church
at Wanwatosa, Wis.
'I tie letter was dated at Chicago, and
the writer said while he was "loitering"
in that city he had heard of L.c Wan
watcsa vacancy and hastened to recom
mend his friend.
"Mr. Parrish, whom I have known from
his boyhood," the letter stated, "was.edu
cated for the bar, is a broad-minded
scholar and a natural orator in fact, pne
of the ablest speakers to whom I have
ever listened; while In social and execu
tive qualities he excels,' being, in short,
just such an 'all around man' as to flt
him for service in such a field as yours."
- Mr. Parrish was not called to Wanwa
tosa, but, unfortunately for him, the dea
con to whom the letter had been sent
met James Lee Barton shortly after its
receipt I and expressed his regret at not
having been able to comply with his re
quest.
Mr. Barton was more than surprised.
He said he had never written such a let
ter, and had not been in Chicago for a
year. Then the forged letter went Into
the hands of the detectives.
"This was written by the forger of the
Sandwich and Watertown drafts," said
the detective who had passed his Juc~
ment on the second Instrument the mo
ment he looked at it. For years the hand
writing of these drafts hau been retained
in his memory.

That "Parrish" would likely keep thr 1
name until the discovery of his recent
phot. Hinnom, the Valley of Slaughter,
the sewer of Jerusalem, the site of all
abominable sacrifices; it is connected
with Jerusalem in an evil way; it has
the same name as Genesis. Now comes
a difficulty. "vP : ; y
This is about the substance of every
thing about Eden â Its garden, and its
trees; quite useless unless it tended to
illustrate a great truth. The first word
God utters to man is; "Thou shalt not
eat"; the last injunction Christ gives
is. "Take,- eat." To the world at large
the history of the fall is foolishness;
such effects could never come from so
small a cause of eating of a tree. So
the large proportion of professing
forgery was made known occurred to the
detectives, and on that conclusion they
acted. Records of the names of 'ulsters
in charge of Congregational clv- -r â :- '--.
every State were examined, when, lo! and
behold, credited to the pastorate of the
First Congregational Church of Marshal â -
town, lowa, was the name "Rev. George
R. Parrish."
To Marshalltown the detectives went,
where they made quiet, searching inquir
ies as to Mr. Parrish, holding him under
the strictest surveillance during their
progress. , For days he was "shadowed."
Detectives' eyes were on him all day, and
every night he slept under their guardian
ship. vyy^y^ ; -yyyyy-; 77.77^7.
It was learned that the pastor ''-nd re
ceived his call through a letter of rec
ommendation, and that that letter was a
forgery. .The detectives ere sure they
had the right man at last, but "to inane
assurance doubly sure" they sent to
Sandwich for the Rev. Mr. Lewis, who
gladly hurried to Marshalltown to ident
ify the man who had so cruelly imposed
on him.
Then came a dramatic finish. Accom
panied by the detective Mr. Lewis en
tered the First Congregational Church
with the congregation, took a seat and
waited . for the beginning of the usual
Sunday morning service. Presently the
Rev. Dr. George R. Parrish entered his
pulpit.
"That is the man," whispered Mr.
Lewis to the detective.
Mr. Parrish was not disturbed then. Ha
conducted the service as usual, preached
a strong sermon, calling upon his congre
gation to live honest, truthful, upright
lives, to never fear to do the right, and
to never stoop to wrong, no matter what
the circumstances or temptations.
When he closed a hush of approval
came over the congregation, which was
followed by words of commendation from
one to another, while many went to the
pulpit to shake their pastor by the hand
and congratulate him on his sermon.
The detectives patiently waited, and
when the pastor left the church he was
shown a warrant for his arrest charging
him with forgery, and was taken Into
custody. He was silent, and consented
to go to Sandwich for trial without the
Issuance of extradition papers. He ls now
there waiting for the action of the Grand
Jury.

letter from a Chinese doctor, who offers
to prevent hair from falling out: He
says:
"What a carrot Is to a horse's coat a

can be explained, but every horseman
knows that a regimen of carrots will
make his stud smooth and lustrous as

( converts, a girl who had been res-
JL cued, educated and married to a laun
dryman, was taken ill. She had no
idea of burning punk or even of prepar
ing a sweet smelling feast for the gods,
but she did want to go to a Chinese
doctor. "White man him he read book;
no learn cure In book."
So Ah Suey determined to go to a real
sure enough doctor who would give her
medicine as strong as her illness.
She did not think it quite au fait to go
on tho street by herself, so she asked me
to "come 'long" in the pretty Chinese
way.
Dr. Wang VI Fat, or translated. Dr. All
Healing Light, has an offlce on Chinese
street, as they call Sacramento street.
At the foot of the stairs a big brass sign
announced ln Chinese that the doctor ln
Ills "exclusive longevity hall" could pre
scribe 600 medicines truly Imported from
the "Antor," and knew how to cure 400
different diseases.
Friends were told to walk In, but others
must ring the bell and. wait. The doctor
quickly opened the door and bowing low
asked us to enter. ,
The room was like my companionâ a
mixture of Chinese and American.
We were shown Into tiny consulting
room by a young American woman. Ah
Suey solemnly sat down before the more
solemn â â tor. Neither spoke as she
C. daced her bared arm on a small satin

all laid down ln tradition by the man
who for thirty days drank the dew from
haml>oo trees to call the genie, who ap
peared and gave him on the pot a per
fect knowledge of all diseases.
I>r. VI placed his four lingers on Buey's
pulse and moved them as In playing a
flute. Five minutes of this linger manipu
lation was devoted to her arms, the doc
tor all the time gazing thoughtfully at
the point of his embroidered shoe, while
Suey kept her eyes fixed solemnly on
space.
At length he broke the silence. "Your

ceeds from a disturbance of the equilib

heat, has ended by exceeding beyond all
measure the proper bounds assigned to it.

lie turned to his desk and covered a
sheet of paper the size of one legal cap
with hieroglyphic* and handed lt to Suey.
Both rose to their feet and bowed low.
*Then ley looked at her prescription, and
pointing to one of. the Ingredients with a

* "Too much moneyâ take it out."
The doctor. replied: "But most glorious,

"Must some time go," answered Suey.
"Maybe now, maybe then. No waste
money, cut it out."
Dr. Vi sighed and shook his head, many
times, but cut out the Item Suey pointed
out. Then she read it over and one other
Item was cut out by the reluctant doctor.
He told her that his father and his broth
ers and his ancestors back for 800 years
had cured and healed. Did she think ha
could mistake? â  V".
"You all light. No spend so much
money."
The learned doctor told her even his

doctors and had prescribed for many
women and children in China.
Even when be showed .her his mother's

rot relent.
* All at once Suey put out her little brown
hand, saying, "Sing Sing,"- and Dr. VI
took it In his with the most graceful bow.
He likewise said "Sing Sing." ..yy.
Then he took off the basket "cosey" of
his teapot and we each had a little green
cup of tea, and everything was lovely.
' When we were going out I turned to the
doctor, end wanting to be polite, I said.
"May your business prosper." Putting
both of his hands over his stomach he
bowed to a right angle and replied in Chi

Special to The Sunday Call.
A TINY force of 760 men, the
Northwestern Mounted Police of
Canada, guards and controls a
territory nearly as large as the
whole of Europe. They are big.
powerful men physically, most of them of
sturdy Scotch or Irish extraction, and the
moral force of the brilliant red tunic
which they wear is a minor revelation of
the method by which the tiny British
Isles govern an empire. Although there
are thousands of Indians, and half-breeds
more dangerous than Indians, and rough,
reckless miners, and outlaws, in their do
main, they ride the plains and climb the
mountains and keep the peace of the
third of a continent.
In 1873, 150 men were sent to Manitoba
from Eastern Canada. That was the be
ginning of the Northwestern Mounted Po
lice. During Riel's rebellion they num
bored 1,000. At present there are in the
Northwest Territories 648; in the Yu
kon, 184.
There are three divisions, each with
headquarters near the United States line.
Each division has outposts, with from
two to ten men each. It has also a
Superintendent and two Inspectors.
Above them are the Commissioner and
Assistant Commissioner. Two extra In

ously by wishing his business to prosper,

TWO MEN AGAINST A' HUNDRED IN
DIANS.
When Piapot, restless, quarrelsome,
drink-doving. and his . swarthy, hawk
faced following, spread their circle of
smoke-tanned tepees near the construc
tion line of the Canadian Pacific Railway
beyond Swift Current, th.ere was inaugur
ated the preliminary of a massacre, or
whatever form ef entertainment the brain
of Piapot might devise.
Then the railway management sent a
remonstrance to the powers. The lieuten
ant-governor, issued, an order; and two
policemen rode forth carrying her Majes
ty's commands. .Not a brigade, nor a
troop; the officer bearing the written or
der was but a sergeant. With him was
one constable; that was the force that
was to move this turbulent tribe from
good hunting ground to a secluded spot
miles away. . ',-'yi ,->r.v
Piapot refused to move. The sergeant
calmly gave him fifteen minutes ln which
to begin striking camp. Result, fifteen
minutes of abuse. The Indians screamed
defiance at the sergeant, and: fired- their
guns under the charger's nose as they
circled about him In their pony spirit
war-dance. Â<.-.'â 'â¢
When the fifteen minutes were up, the
sergeant throw, his picket line to the con
stable, dismounted, walked over to Chief
Plapot's tepee and calmly knocked the
key-polo out. All the warriors rushed for
their guns, and one of the biggest bluffs
on record was played by the redskin.
But the sergeant continued methodical
ly knocking key-poles out, and Plapot

man of much prominence in his district.
He knew Suey, and we had a cup of tea
before we began business. He said most
politely it was a great pleasure for him
to be able to speak with mo, that he was
much honored. The druggist said it was
a tonic thai Dr. Vi had ordered for Suey,
but it was a pity she had refused to have
the "iing-poi -you-y-tan" put In. It is the
supernatural treasure for all desires In
either kill the sergeantâ stick his knife in
' the heart of the whole British nation â
or give vp and move away.
He chose the latter course, for Piapot
* had brains.
SITTING BULL OUTWITTED.
After the killing of Custer, Sitting Bull
became a more or less orderly tenant of
her Majesty the Queen. With 900 lodges
he camped at Wood Mountain, just over
the border from Montana. An arrow's
flight away was the Northwestern Mount
ed Police post. One* morning the police
found six dead Saltaux Indians, scalped
In approved Sioux fashion. A seventh
Saltaux, still alive, had seen the killing.
The police burled the dead Indians and
took the living one to their post.
With characteristic cheek, Sitting Bull
came, accompanied by chiefs and war
riors, to demand the seventh Saltaux. In
Wood Mountain there were 20 policemen
backing Sergeant McDonald. With the
chief there were at least 500 warriors.
Sitting Bull throw his squat figure from
his pony and thrust the muzzle of his gun
into. Sergeant McDonald's stomach. Mc-
Donald was typical of the force. He
pushed the gun- to one side and told the
chiefs to step inside the gate, stack their
arms and come insid* the shack for a
pow-wow. - _. .
They" demurred; the sergeant was firm.
Outside, it was play day in- Bedlam. The
young bucks rode and whooped and fired
their guns. ;-7*.'.:77 : i-'.i. - -
"Send your men away," said the ser
geant to Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull de
murred.
. "Send them away!" \ repeated : the ser
geant, "If you have authority." ,
Sitting Bull and his chiefs made toward
the door, but there were Interruptionsâ
red-coated objections. - And outside ln the
yard the chief's. rifles were stacked.
Sitting Bull, like Piapot, had brains.
The bucks were sent away. 'â  Then t the
.scry.*.*.. pet_oiadÂ«d . th* chiefs - try Ue^9
English, and a true panacea for all ills,
according to the dose and the manner of
taking.
The medicine consisted of tiny red pills
with 1 a strong odor of musk. They are
made by one family ln China, who alone
possess the secret of their composition.
Their .manufacture has made the family
famous. and rich for hundreds of years,
but no blasphemous analytical chemist
has ever attempted to solve the mystery
of their Ingredients. It would be most
affronting to the god who first gave the
secret to its possessor's ancestor. But
the little red pills are expensive, and
Suey, who says she has to die some time,
anyhow, would not waste any precious
gold on them, for they are one of a num
ber of medicines which must be paid for
by an equal weight In gold. The medicine
is put in one scale and the pure gold must
balance the weight of the pills; so they
are literally worth their weight ln gold.
. The druggist laid the prescription on the
counter and with a long wooden block ran
over the items and laid a large square
of paper on the counter in which to place
the Ingredients. Two other men were
making prescriptions for customers, tak
ing the herbs from the drawers which
lined the wall back of the counter. There
were ninety drawers in one square, and
over and below were thirty more, all un
labeled, but the mixers of medicine never
hesitated â¢as to which drawer they
wanted.
There : were plenty of customers, and
two men were. busy cutting up the roots
and what seemed like dried vegetables
into thin, attractive wafers.
Over the door to a small private office
was a sign in black letters on red paper,
"Step Inside to look at the ginseng." Be
side the sign was another, "Cinnamon is
kept here." I asked why the ginseng and
cinnamon were kept in the other room,
and was told it is because they are so
valuable.' Like the little red "supernat
ural treasures," ginseng and the clnna
man bark ' which Chinese druggists use
are worth their weight ln gold.
The druggist was putting up the pre
scription and Suey asked him to tell us
what each thing was and what it was for.
First he counted out ten dried bad
smelling bits of gristle,- which he said were
the sinews of deer. Deer are very fleet
of foot and never are tired, so for the
"tired feeling" the sinews were a remedy.
Then he put ln a handful of reddish
brown pressed leaves. They are the leaves
of the Haw Show Woo tree and are to
make one feel young again. The flrst
Haw Show Woo tree was a gift of the
gods thousands of years ago.
Chinese herbs usually have some legend
connected with them to illustrate their
virtues, and this is the story connected
with the "Haw" herb: Haw Show Woo
was a very good, very devout and very
old man. One day *he was accused of
stealing the affections of his brother's
wife and was sent to" prison for trial. He
became very hungry and prayed to the
gods as became a man of his great piety.
During the night a bush sprang up
through the floor of his dungeon, and in
the morning the famished man ate the
leaves. Days went by while he was wait
ing for his trial and he continued to piece
out his scanty diet with the leaves of the
bush. When he was taken into court for
trial the officers exclaimed: "This is not
the man who was arrested and confined
ln the cell. The culprit is an old man;
this is a young man." Â»
Sure enough Haw had become a young
man to all appearances again.
They investigated the case anyhow and
discovered that Haw was innocent all the
while.
Before taking the shackles off the pris
oner ' ey asked him if he was really Haw.
"** __," he replied.
' xhen tell us about this wonderful
change in your appearance." So Haw told
him the story of the little plant that had
grown up in his cell and how he had eaten
the leaves.
The.offlcials dug up the shrub and pre
sented it to the Emperor. His family for
many years was the only one that had the
privilege of eating the sacred leaves. But
as time passed slips were cut from it and
sent through the kingdom, and now the
commonest coolie may eat of the wonder
furtherâ mainly by force of the red-coated
arguments he had brought to bear. "Tar
ry here, my brothers," he said, "until
I send Constable Collins and two others
of my men to arrest the murderers. The
Saltaux are subjects of the Queen. We
cannot allow them to be killed for the
fun of the thing."
ADVENTURE OF BIG JACK COLLINS.
Then big Jack Collinsâ wild Irishman
and all the rest of Itâ went over, to the
Sio^c camp and arrested three. The
buc,s jostled and shoved them, fired pis
tols over their heads, but big Jack and
his comrades hung on to their prisoners
and worked their way to the post, with'
no sign of annoyance until a big buck
spat In Collins' face. .
A big mutton-leg fist shot out, and the
Sioux lay like a crushed moccasin at
Jack's feet. 'Take that, ye black baste!"
he hissed between clenched teeth; "an'
ye've, .made me disobey orders, ye foul
fiend!"
. Then-he marched his prisoners into the
post and reported himself for misconduct
in striking an Indian.
Now a little as to the physique of the
Northwestern mounted police. In height
their average is 5 feet 9 Inches, with a
chest measurement of 38 Inches. Men
and horses are subjected to a most
searching medical examination before be
ing taken on. The regulations of enlist
ment, are framed, Indeed, "to make it a
most difficult force to get into and an
easy one to get out of.". Result, a fine
body of contented men and few deser
tions.- .-.*.â  -
During the Rlel rebellion the police were
always at the front. It was iat the tak
ing of.Batoche that Jack French, a big
hard -flghtjng Irishman, inspector of po
lice, became Immortal. After a hot scrim
mage a wounded policeman was left on
the field. Jack French saw : him and
shouted ln a brogue with the music of an
organ la it: â¢"'What ar* you doln' there.
- . ... .. . â¢ .. :*â¢- -- y . - -...â ".â¢.
ful Haw plant and renew his youth If he
possesses enough money.
Besides these Haw leaves the druggist
put in some powdered bone of the elk.
The elk has strong bones and the horn is,
as it were, the cream of all his bones.
So powdered elk's horns will take away
the ache In one's bones.
Then there were two dried lizards,
which the druggist cut in half with a long
scissors before he threw them in. Lizards
are agile and quick and active ln their
movements, bo they are good to cure that
disinclination to wake up and go to work.
The livelier the lizard the more agility
you acquire by drinking a broth of him.
Then there were cucumber seeds and
watermelon seeds, because every one
knows how- cooling are watermelons and
cucumbers. They are to combat the "ig
neous element" and make lt retire to its
proper sphere. K3B
A handful of big brown beetles was
added to make Suey Increase in beauty
or to take on more fat. The beetles are
fat and soft themselves, so increase those
attributes in her who eats them.
A handful of spiders went in. Spiders
are hungry. They eat and never have
enough; so spiders help to create an ap
petite and make everything taste, good,
even in a boarding-house.

of wafers which looked and smelled like
parsnip, but which he called wang tslng,
or bright slave.
While we had been talking a messenger
brought In a stick of wood shaped like a
knife. The handle part was red and on
the blade were some black characters.
He said it was a notice for him to attend
a meeting of his company. He tied up
the parcel, about six inches square,
tucked the folded prescription into the
grass string with which he tied up the
bundle, leaving a loop to carry. It by.
Then Suey asked him for something
else and he consulted his book of pre
scriptions. He made up another much
smaller prescription, but did not tell us
what went Into it. When we had said
"Sing Sing" and were on the street Suey
told me she had asked him to give her
something to make her hair stop falling
out. I was sure that I had 'seen some
Cook.?" "I'm wounded," came back a
faint call.
"It's mesilf'll carry you, thin!" and
down he marched, whistling, though two
bullets cut the skirts of his tunic. - â¢ v:Â ;
"They're gettin' pretty close now," mut
tered Jack; but he was only a few feet
from Cook.
. May it be remembered to the credit of
the half-bpeed rebels that, when they re
alized what French's mission was they
ceased fire. And when he swung his com
rade upon his broad shoulders and start
ed home with him a cheer ran along the
whole rebel line.
He brought Cook ln safe and then went
back to the fighting. His reward was net'
the â¢ Victoria Cross, for ln half an hour
he was dead. Cook still lives. He is in
tho Government employ. " ~ â'ââ â¢*-â
dried rats go Into the prescription, and
Suey said I was right but not to say
anything about rats before a Chinaman
because he does not like It. I asked her
If she did not think the dose would be
bard to take.
"Not so bad as sickness," she an
swered. "Bad devils not like bad devils
go way." Which meant she could stand
it, but the bad devils of sickness could
not and would go away and let the melon
and cucumber seeds do their work and
bring harmony in her "sublime organiza
tion.
â  Suey was to pour four bowls of water
over the medicines and boll them. When
the four measures of water had been
boiled down to one measure, about two
teacupsful, she was to drink it as hot
and as quickly as she could.
She was quite sure she would soon be
well, and I agreed with her when she
quoted to me the proverb, "While the
medicine works the patient Is under the
care of the most high one."
She told me another proverb the Chi
nese have which says, "A doctor has the
heart to cut flesh off his own thigh to
give to his patient, but never the heart
to deceive him.". That would be quite
as true in English as Chinese.
Suey had been charged to bring home
sundry articles for her neighbors, and
as the parcels of medicine were large I
suggested to her to leave them in the
first shop she entered, as ehÂ© wanted to
go Into several.
She looked her horror at my ignorance
and then explained that around the rest
ing-place of medicine all the devils of
illness lurked, and any man would very
much dislike her to leave such a com
pany in his shop to destroy him and his
business. HELEN GREY.

THE LOOTING OF THE CONVOY
HOPE rrz> the last a bad -w=>T "
INHERE are some things." said the captain, "which a soldier may
value even more than life Itself, and one of them Is the discharge
to the very letter of the trust which has been reposed in him by a
superior officer."
The subaltern rolled a fresh cigarette with his fingers and stuck
it between his teeth at an angle -which made it like a tiny flagstaff.
"You haven't been In charge of a convoy before, have you*?"
asked, 'lie subaltern.
"No." responded Malcolm, "and that's why I feel the responsibility
and honor of It BO keenly. You know that the very greatest care Is shown
in choosing officers for the command of the convoys down the pass; and
I am very proud. Indeed, at the confidence which the general has reposd
ln me."
"Sort of makes you feel a man," said Duncan. "I know the sensationâ
I had it when I first appeared in my kilt. 1 thought the heart of the world
stood still for the occasion."
"Don't be Idiotic, Duncan." said the captain, shortly.
"It's gospel, or I shouldn't mention it to you, especially as you're such
a one for facts. I'm sure that our own sensations now are equal to what
my own were when, as I say, i first appeared In â "
"Really." interrupted the senior. Impatiently, "you do at times make
the most absurd comparisons."
"But it's honorable it's the tartan." protested Duncan, greatly enjoy
ing this unexpected chance of exasperating his dearest friend. "I.ord"' he
added, with mock may. "You don't mean to say you're turning traitor
to the cause of the kilt and the bonnet?"
"I never suggested .<.** said the captain, in great haste, and very grave
ly. He was a sober, steady Scotchman of strong Presbyterian tendencies,
and held such levity as Duncan's in horror.
"Why." continued Duncan, "you'll be false to the nickname and the
march next. What should we be without our 'Dirty Knees' and 'Come to
me, and I will give you flesh'? You might as well put us Into trousers at
once."
"You willfully misunderstand me." said Malcolm. "No man believes
more In the regiment and its traditions and rights than i do, and no ma
tries mere to uphold them."
Duncan gave a shout of laughter, which rang down the pass. "How
easy lt is to rag you," he said. "And what a temptation! Who could stand
against It?"
"Silence there, ordered the captain, as the men's laugh rang our also.
They had no clear perception of what they were amused at, but the sub
altern seemed to be tickled, and being very sympathetic they rejoiced wit!*
him.
A color sergeant of the party, who had laughed louder than any one
of the rest, on the strength of being a remote member of the subaltern's
clan, became wooden-visa ged on hearing the captain's order, and repeated
it with the additional request that the men should stop their ".'.aft blether"
generally. --
"You are demoralizing the convoy," said the captain, severely. "This
ls hardly the place for joking. We're In the land of the enemy, and no
man knows when ho may be out off. I wonder how people can laugh and
make fun in those gloomy hills. It isn't in keeping with the spirit of the
place."
"By Jove," grumbled the somewhat subdued subaltern, "it would be a
dreary region if we couldn't venture on a Joke sometimes. Those who
brought you up didn't give you much elastic on the Sabbath."
The captain marched on in dignified silence, scorning to take notice of
Duncan's method of expressing himself, and for some time the kilts
swayed monotonously, and brown, hare knees pooped out from them as
the men toiled along the narrow, dangerous mountain pathway.
"We are." said the captain' after a pause, "in a region which may be
said to be alive with danger. We are in an out-of-the-way spot in a very
dangerous pas*, and liable at any time to attack from a strong, relentless
tribe. A convoy like this, remember. Is worth much in the way of loot to
th" hillmen, carrying, as we do. stores and ammunition. It was about here
that a cor.-. of laden mules under a British officer, escorted by only a
dozen native soldiers, was cut to pieces. Every soldier and muleteer was
put to the knife, and the officer, rather than run for it and save his own
life, as he could have done, died fighting and trying to protect the wound
ed. You remember the incident?"
The subaltern nodded. "It seems to me." he said, "that the chap
oughtn't to have been sent with a mere handful of men on an errand like
thatâ the men natives, too. Now, If they'd been a dozen of Ousâ"
"It would have been better." Malcolm interrupted, graciously; "but the
natives fought like men to the end."
"1 wonder what would happen if we were put in the same boat?" said
Duncan, questioning!*-.
"The same thing." replied the captain. ,
"Meaning*""" queried the subaltern,
"That if we were attacked we should stand by the stores and ammu
nition."
"And each other?"
"That ewa without saying."
"You're a proper one for going baldheaded for duty." said Duncan, ad
miringly. "You couldn't make It clearer to a fellow if you put a nail In his
head and hammered it."
"That would let sense out. instead of driving lt In," rejoined the cap
tain, almost with a laugh. "But." he added, repressing any suspicion of
levity, "this is no place for merriment.. Don't these hills remind you of the
Highlands?"
"They're quite as dismal, If that's what you mean," said the subaltern
"And they've got another resemblanceâ they're Infested by clansmen i
suppose that when we've quite civilized them they'll swarm with illicit
whisky stills."
There was a gruff laugh from the rear of the officers, a laugh which
showed that the conversation was being followed with admiring attention
by the sergeant and the men.
"More than one of these fellows have been there, evidently," continued
the subaltern In a low voice, regardless of Malcolm's reproving look. "And
still would go, T suppose. I'll warrant a few of them would like to under
take a bit of good missionary work of that sort. Why not? There are
worse things than the barley bree. And think, as a good Scot of the
profit of it." 7:.yyyy
As be spoke they got out of the foot of the pass and emerged In a
straggling little column, upon a small plain.
The last mule had left the shelter of the rocky path, and every animal
and man was In the open, when a shot was heard, and looking at the Side
of the hill at his right, the captain saw a puff of smoke. The little cloud
rose as bo gaze.', a cloud In which he saw a tiny tongue of fire A second
later he heard the crack of the jezall.
"Ah!" exclaimed Malcolm.
"Loot!" said the subaltern. "That's the meaning of it. And this in
view of the fact that only a week ago two hiilmen were hanged for at
tacking an escort. J.t shows how little they care for the moral of lessons
even when they're taught by the British army. Now I've done chattering'
Command me." * . â¢ uer ''*' ''
"You shall hive the 'post of honor," said the captain, ouicklv but

The subaltern. Color Sergeant Mill, and half the small force hurried
smartly to the rear, and the muleteers thrashed their hardy iit.il
beasts on. â * ''"-"-'<*â¢

Hi-/ SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 23, 1899.
The mules trotted on across the plain, and the men kept well along
side. Duncan.. the color sergeant, and the rest of the rear guard followed
rather more slowly.
"Push on!" was the commander's order.- and the stern necessity of
obeying it was borne upon those who remained unhurt. Bullets pinged
about the convoy and knocked down here and there a man or beast. If
the soldier lived he was put upon a mule; if dead, they left him where' he
fell, though Malcolm, knowing what must follow from the hlllmen's
knives, yearned as much to carry them with him as If they still had
breath. If the mule carried stores, both were left, but ammunition was
transferred, ln obedience to the captain's will. Come what may. Malcolm
vowed that such a deadly aid should not fall into the power of the enemy.
Every bullet might mean a countryman's life later, for he. knew, as well
as his people knew, that among the clans were those who had the guns
for which these very cartridges were made.
"Push on!" he cried once more, casting an anxious look to see how
Duncan and the rear guard fared. So far as he could tell the subaltern,
the color sergeant and the men were yet uninjured, or at any rate not so
severely wounded that they could not fight and retire together.
A bullet struck the captain in the ankle. "Push on, men!" he cried, con
quering his pain and hobbling over the rough and rocky ground.
Another shot laid a muleteer at his feet. "He's dead or 1 wouldn't
leave him." he shouted, for the encouragement of the rest. "Push on, and
through the little pass there before the'hlllmen cut us off. God helps those
who help themselves, and we can get over the ground faster than they
can."
"I've toppled an ugly nigger over, sir," said a bronzed, sturdy -private
named Gladwin, who had halted for an instant to fire a shot. "He came
a mucker from a ledge a hundred feet up. He'll shoot slugs no more."
"Pot as hard as you like when the chance comes," said Malcolm; "but
don't forget what.we've to do. Push on!"
"It's a rum sort of order, an' not In the drill book." said Gladwin to a
comrade. "Rut even the very mules seem to understand it. Push onâ
yes. by George, we'll have to, If the niggers all get along like that. I_ook!"
He pointed to a narrow, straight ledge of rock, along which a line of
men was gliding. The first, was already preparing to descend at a point
which would enable him to reach the ground and get in front of the con
voy before it entered the narrow gorge loading to the vale beyond, in which
the headquarters camp was pitched. '-.7 .'.'...:"'
"Push on!" shouted the captain, "before he gets to the ground and the
others follow."
"I knew a good trick, sir, if you'll let me stop a bit an' play it," said
Private Gladwin.
"What is It?" demanded Malcolm, hobbling on. "Get ahead there!
Don't stop, at your peril!"
"This, sir." shouted Gladwin, exultantly: "but â  T want another rifle
to do it properly. The player of this game has to be sort of fed."
He crouched behind a little loose rock near him, and sheltering him
self carefully, presented his rifle deliberately at- the leading hillman and
tire,!. 7 _â '... .
The target toppled over and bounded down the hillside.
Gladwin's rifle cracked again, and the bullet claimed Its man. A third
hissed from the muzzle, and the unerring marksman brought his quarry'
down.
"I'm a proper sort of rear guard for you." shouted Gladwin. "Can yon
trust yourself to shove on, sir. an ' leave 'em to me till Mr. Duncan
comes up?"
By wry of answer the captain roared, "Push on. we're cur. to do It
now. They'll never live on that ledge. You, Mark, and I will lie down with
Gladwin and shoot them as they run."
"It's a jolly game of pick and choose," said Gladwin. "This i. where
the magazine comes in handy. Crumbs! They're firm' like a pepper cas
ter' 'Watch!"
He put his helmet on his bayonet point and stuck It cautiously above
th" rock. Instantly a little shower of bullets flattened themselves against
the stone. The helmet was riddled and the hackle was shot away. "That's
a trophy to show." said Gladwin, laughingly. "Only even mv head Isn't
thick enough to make anybody believe that I wore it when the shots
tamo."
"Keep under -shelter." cried Malcolm, warnlngly,
"We've ragged 'cm, It's true," said Gladwin. "Load's cheap to-day."
He presented cautiously, and picked another man off. ' â¢
"Thai settled 'cmâ they've turn* d tall! Hooray!"
He jumped up and blazed at the line, which was now hurrying hack
to be--. shelter, and abandoning the attempt to annihilate the head of
the convoy and Intercept the passage to he camp.
Th" head of the convoy staggered on toward the mouth of the gorge
and hurried through it Into the vale beyond.
A tall Highlander, one Maxwell' heaved it. and took unto himself the
command. "You rush on to camp, thin [unâ you ought to he able to cut It
judging from the way you've legged it so farâ an' tell 'em we want a troop'
o' cavalry."
He addressed a dazed muleteer, and. so that the man might collect his
wits, struck him with a groat fist in. the back and sent him reeling over
the tin In the right direction.
"Push en'" roared the Highlander. "Captain's orders!"
In a sort of frenzy he seized each muleteer as he emerged from the
gorge and smote him as he had smitten the (.first, who was now tearing
toward the still, white tents, feeling very much more comfortable than he
had bee,, when under fire. By way of further encouragement Maxwell
gave rpoh passing mule a resounding slap*. .;-.'*
There was a break in the progress of the convoy. Maxwell's vigor hav
ing got the head in advance of the tail. He turned back into the gorge to
hurry on and help the rear, and as he did so the last of the string of hill
men -that Gladwin had shot rolled down to his feet.
"That settles the ledge dodge!" he exclaimed. "I hope it's the last ef
.->. bad lotâ the murdering, looting thieves!"
He looked up the hillside and saw that tho line of demoralized dans
men had turned and was hurrying back to Join In a last desperate assault
upon I lie rear guard.
"Head party safely through, sir." reported Maxwell. "I'll go' and help
to get the tail on." ' .
He dashed toward the rear as If he might have been taking part in
some exhilarating game, and did with the muleteers and mules there as
he had done with those who wore now on the safe side of the valley
"A queer show, upon my word!" said Duncan, with a laugh, as Maxwell
thumped the beasts and the drivers. "I'll give you the finest bottle of
Scotch you over tasted when wo get out of this."
"That's something to work for!" shouted Maxwell, "Here, laddie no
living men are going to be left behind while Donald Maxwell stands on
two undamaged logs!"
He seized a comrade who had been shot in the leg and had stumbled
hoisted him upon his broad shoulders and began to walk off with him.
Feyshad:An Oriental Story of the Mirage and the
Lesson It Taught a Foolish Merchant

The merchant Feyshad. Sire, in a Journey across the desert, fell
apart one day from tbe caravan with which he trai-eled. and. caus
| ing his camel to kneel, he dismounted tor the purpose of counting the
**â  emeralds and rubies In the sack which he wore at his belt.
In this sack there were balas rubies of the color of a white
mouse's eye, and emeralds colored like the grass after rain, and. also.
there were green sapphires and sapphires of cornflower blue, and sapphire
colored like the Bosphorus on a windless day; and pearls, Sire, some black
and bean-shaped like the thumb of an Ethiopian woman, and some like a
woman's little teeth, and. some that blushed rose red. as if at the thought
of their own beauty. ?'.-"- ;.'*' â '.â  '
So lost was the merchant In contemplation of his treasures that he did
not notice Sleep, who, passing by on his gray mule, cast a handful of
poppy seeds on the head of Feyshad, and then rode on, laughing, with eyes
half closed, in the track of the vanishing caravan. Feyshad had slept
scarcely an hour. Sire, when, awaking, he glanced around and found him
self alone. His camel had forsaken him, and over all the yellow desert
burning beneath the noonday sun there was no trace of life, save the
bleachingbones that here and there marked the road of the caravans. . â¢
He turned to the east and to the west, to the north and to the south,
and nothing did he see but the sands running"*to a rim against the sky]
save in the east, where a sand devil danced upon the plain, making move
ments as if in derision of Feyshad. "â :. .."7;
"Alas!" cried the unhappy merchant as he tore his beard. "Fool that I
am: That 1 might count my treasure in safety I withdrew me from the
caravan, where was my real safety. I thirst, but where shall I find water
here? The sun consumes me, but where shall I find shade?" Then he
ceased for fear of his own voice, which sounded strange in that echoless
desert, and sitting with his eye fixed upon the sand devil, which was now
dancing into the west, he gave himself to despair, till suddenly. Sire he
was startled by a voice from behind, crying:
"Feyshad! "
. The merchant. Sire, turned, and to his astonishment he saw before him
at twenty paces distant, an Arab veiled in white and seated upon an ass '
â¢ ' At this sight a great horror fell upon the soul of Fevshad, for but' a
moment before, he had been alone seated amid the vastness of the desert
Nor did his horror grow less when he beheld the thing before him cease
lesslyÂ»changlng form as It spoke, yet speaking always In the same voice
Now, it was an Arab seated upon an ass; now, a woman naked and be
striding a lion; it would shrink now to an ape seated upon a dog and now
it would swell to the form of a stout man upon a camel.
And Ho- form cried to him, saying: "i-'eyahad, I am the Fata Morgana
the dreamer of the desert. I bring to the waste places the ghoÂ«ts of the
cities, with their mosques and towers, and the sapphire shadow of the Nile
bends at my v#ord through the heat-shaken air and past the feet of dying
men. 1 give to man the one thing realâ lllusion. I am thine * Â»
Then Feyshad, consumed by thirst, cried out, heedless of the horror
before him: "Water, I pray you. water!"
And lo! Sire, Feyshad found himself seated ln the courtyard of his
own house in Old Cairo, and the fountain in its center played beneath the
sun, casting its diamond-bright waters to the sky, and the great acacia
planted by his father cast upon Feyshad its pleasant shadow. His thirst
had vanished at the sight of the water, nor did he notice that the fountain
was but the ghost or shade of a fountain without song or sound and that
the leaves of the acacia moved ln the breeze without a whisper. '
His tortoise crawled upon the pavement of the courtyard Throueh an
open door he saw within the house the figure of his wife like a brown
shadow against the sunlight of a window that lay beyond. She waa grind

The subaltern opened wide his eyes in anger. "Leave you!" he echoed.
"Not if you deliberately ordered it, and the men heard you; and not If ten
thousand of these blood-stained brutes came upon us. Not me! Here, wi

He thrust the rifle into the captain's hand, and put a strong arm
around his waist. "Now, Just you hop as best you can on the one leg."
The captain obeyed. It was almost absurd, but they were not able Just
then te appreciate the humor of it.

wounded ankle.
"The stores will keep them back a bit," said Duncan. "See how they're'
scrambling and worrying each other to get them. They'll have a bit of
loot, after all."
"But precious little, sir." said Gladwin, reloading his magazine. "I

"Thank God!" exclaimed the captain, fervently.
"Look out!" cried Gladwin. "Give 'em a fair field."
There was a roar and rush of horsemen through the gorge and across
the plain, the glitter of sun on steel, and the shout of excited men as a
troop of lancers swept past.
"Just in time!" sang out the leader of the troop as he rushed on at
the head., waving his sword. "Thanks for giving us a chance like this."
"It'll be like playin' polo." opined Gladwin. "Lord, how they'll scatter
'em and pick 'em out of the holes with the lances! It's a time like this
that makes a chap feel that the horseman Is nearly as good as the kilted

He fired two or three parting shots, and then ordered his rifle with the
air of a man who had done his duty.
""We can stay here safely now," said Malcolm. "Thanks, old fellow,
I don't know that we need be ashamed of the affair. I've acted up to my
ethics."
"The affair will be hard to beat in this little war, anyhow," answered
Duncan. "But what would you have done, suppose things hadn't turned
out so well? How would you have prevented the ammunition from getting
into their hands?" > â  v -" , : 7v7.

the subaltern. "Good old ethics. But what a planâ now-, I should never

"It's a good finish. They're coming back. Ah! I'm glad they're bring

"They didn't give us a chance," growled the troop leader, as he rode
up "Scurried off like rabbitsâ wouldn't face the lances. But they got a

FOUGHT
SIDE BY
SIDE.
WHEJ. JJ.E BJ-UTISjH AND AMEJ-_IC/\NS FOUQHJ SIDE BY SIDE IN SAjMO^ 1899.
BRITISH and American marines
have fought side by side again. â¢
The latest instance, as has been
heralded to the world by tele
graph, occurred at Samoa on
April 1, and sent a thrill of ap
proval through the hearts of the
people of both great nations. ,
Of course things were not always so.
There was a time not so long ago when
the sight of one on shore leave was a
signal for the other to fly at his throat.
This state of affairs went on from the
time of the founding of our republic until
ISS9, when all bitterness was "sponged
out."
This happy state of affairs came about
st the mouth of the Pelho River, China,
on the day that Captain Tatnall uttered
the immortal words, "Blood is thicker
than water."
The affair that occurred on this day is
without doubt the flrst Instance where
British and American forces have offi
cially acted together in arms against a
common foe, or for the achievement of a
mutually desired end. It is not, however,
the flrst tlmo that the Innate feeling of
brotherhood between the men of the two
great English-speaking nations has
spoken forth In noble actions, gratefully
recognized and applauded on both sides
of the water.
Though as British subjects the Ameri
can colonists had fought side by side with
the British regulars against a common
foe and as freely poured out their blood
for the glory of the British flag at Louis
burg. Fort Duquesne, Quebec and many
another hard fought field, they were
never accorded such recognition by their
comrades ln arms ns was their due, but
were rather treated with jealousy and
contempt.
The success of the American arms on
land and pea during the revolution and the
war of 1812 enforced a certain amount of
respect for their prowess, but added a
bitterness that amounted almost to hatred
on the one side, which was cordially re
ciprocated on the other.
This semi-hostile attitude was the cause
cf frequent duels between the officers of.
the two services, and many bloody colli
sions between their men, when they met
in the various ports of the world.
The action of the American commander
end his men put an end to all this and
Inaugurated an era of mutual esteem and
friendliness that has borne prod fruit In
the years that have followed, a notable
instance of which was the prompt and ef
fective protection of the British flag and
British guns given to the helpless Ameri
can Consul and the doomed Americans of
tho ill-fated Vlrglnlus by the captain of
the British sloop-of-war Niobe at San
tiago de Cuba in 1573.
Coming Into port and hearing that Cap
tain Fry and fifty of the men captured on
the vessel had already been butchered ln
cold blood. In spite of the protests and
sppenls of the American Consul, and that
nnother large number were then about to'
he slaughtered, he ran his lone little ves
sel in between the city and the two Span
ish warships lying in the harbor and sent
word to the Butcher Buriel" that the
murders must cease or he would blow the
ships and city to pieces. The slaughter
was stopped and 100 American lives were
saved.
Tatnall's words and actions were not
forgotten. With Captain Sinclair "blood
was thicker ' than water." Serving the
gun on board the Plover was not the
only Instance of timely and valuable aid
to the distressed Britons rendered by Tat
nall and his men. The story of that day's
work contains others.
Great Britain and Francs were endeav
oring to secure from the Chinese Govern
ment recognition of a treaty made some
time before with Viceroy Yek at Canton
and the admission of their Commission
ers to the Chinese capital.
The allied fleets, under command of Ad
miral Hope, arrived at the mouth of the
Peiho River on June 20, 1559.
The American war steamer Powhattan,
under Captain Tatnall, arrived the same
day, having on board John E. Ward and
suite, who were to represent the United
States in the negotiations that were ex
pected to follow, but with no Instructions
to resort to force to obtain the desired
ends. >
The Chinese, In anticipation of an at
tack by the English and French, had for
tified the river, in hopes of making It *
impregnable. VStt
Immediately on his arrival off the bar
Admiral Hope sent a boat to communi
cate with the commander of the forts, ex
plain the friendly nature of his mission
and request the removal of the obstruc
tions from the channel of the river. This
being refused, he wrote to the authori
ties, saying that if they were not removed
by the evening of June 24 he would re
move them himself.
While matters were in this condition
Captain Tatnall. with Mr. Ward, leaving
the Powhattan outside, started up the
river in the Toey-wan, a light-draft
steamer ohartered for the purpose. When
the Toey-wan was near the first barrier
she ran aground on the hidden bank, and
was for a time ln a critical situation from
exposure to the batteries, and the danger
of the fast-falling tide leaving her half
hanging on the bank.
The British vessel Plover came to her
aid, with an offor of the privilege of hoist
ing the American flag on her, if necessary
to abandon the Toey-wan.
Willie hanging there Captain Tatnall
aent his lieutenant to the officer in com
mand of the fort to say that the vessel
had come for the purpose of going up the
river to Peking with the United States
Minister, who had been directed to de
liver to the Emperor in person a letter
from the President and 'to ratify the
treaty. '.-', yy
The reply was that the barriers could
not be removed, as they had been placed
there to protect the villages from rebels
and pirates, and that on any attempt to
remove them the forts would open fire.
On this the Toey-wan, when finally re
leased from her perilous position,
dropped down the river again to a point
near the bar.
Receiving no answer to his letter of the
20th, Admiral Hope made his preparations
to go ahead anyway. Leaving the larger
vessels outside, he proceeded with the
Plover, to which he transferred his flag,
and ten other light gunboats, mounting
in all twenty-eight guns and carrying
some 800 officers and men, across the bar
and Into the mouth of the river. Seven
hundred marines were, placed on board of
Junks and anchored near the bar as a
reserve force and storming party in case
it would be necessary to attack the forts
by land.
Though up to this time everything had
"Worn an entirely pacific appearance, some
uneasiness was felt from the rumors that
Russians were on hand to assist the Chi
nese.
The advance began early on the morn
ing of the 25th. when the flood tide was
running strong, but owing to the nar
rowness of the channel and the strength

WHEN we look about among our married friends and acquaintances
we cannot help wishing for the power to shuffle them like a pack of

.Just across the street, perhaps, lives the charming domestic woman with all
the lovely traits which keep this old world worthy , of : the Creator's attention,
and she is mated to a monster of Infidelity and vice.
Through the open windows of a summer cottage- whose inmates I knew . I
heard a selfish, pett<**-souled woman scolding one of the best men who ever fell
to a woman's lot as husband.
An hour later, in a public conveyance, a disagreeable husband nagged the
sweetest of wives in the presence of a dozen strangers.
One could not help thinking that It would be a comfort, to readjust those four
families and to let the vicious pair and the scolding pair drive each other to
swift destruction, while the four amiable and moral people enjoyed that Eden
on earthâ happy home, where love and harmony preside. t

At 2 o'clock, when the ebb tide was
strong, the flrst barrier, having, been,
broken and passed and the Plover, with
the Opossum, was â¢ attempting to break
through the guard, the mask was thrown
off. A single gun was fired from the fort

VOLLEY BALL THE NEW GAME
FOR FIRLS
GIRL'S HIGH SCHOOL HAS JUST STARTED IN HERE
GENERAL GRANT'S MOST ASTONISHING EXPERIENCE
Lanadon Kaine Tells for -he First Time of the Arousing and Exciting Experience of General Grant at a Negro Mass-Meeting During His Triumphant Visit to New Orleans in 1880.
Special to the Sunday Call.
IN the spring of 3J.SO General Grant,
after Ins memorable' tour of the
world, visited the Southern States
and brought his- triumphal journey
to a close at Xew Orleans,' where he
remaJn-'d a week or two. There- 1
I-Lccompa] led the general to what proved
to be perhaps the most exciting demon
stration of negroes of those timesâ a dem
onstration which General Grant called his
SncKt astonishing experience.
A new generation was (ring on the
.Scene, and although the men who had
â¢ been conspicuous in the service of the
Confederal States had cordially wel
.corned Grant to the defeated section,
there were people In the Crescent City
â¢who could not bring themselves to the
point of taking part In the street dem
onstration in honor of the hero of the
Union army. Many 'of those who se
cluded themselves during the public cere
monies subsequently called on Grant at
tbÂ© residence of his cousin.
As the- hour for the arrival of the
|Grant party approached the streets
â â warmed with black faces, shining with
'enthusiasm and hope. Somehow they
concelved the idea that Grant had come
piot as a private citizen but as their
'Moses, to restore their political suprem
acy. They were more serious and less
[boisterous than on other public occasions,
when their loud laugh distinguishes the
Southern from the quiet Northern gather
ing. The escort of the Grant party was
'first a company of United States reg
ulars, then a post of the Grand Army of
.thÂ© Republic and a cfvic society or two.
It was not Impressive as a procession, but
â¢as lt came the fervor of the inflammable
pegro nature reached almost the limit,
[and- when It passed the black mass fell
lin behind, filling the street from curb to
curb.
Service at the hotels and restaurants
â where the negroes were employed was
utterly inefficient. The blacks were ab
sorbed in the one subject, too exalted by
a now-born hope to concern themselves
about their usual business.
The general was disposed to be as quiet
as possible without appearing discour
teous. "When first asked to receive a
delegation of colored preachers of the
Northern Methodist church he pleaded
fatigue. After some persuasion he con
cerned to meet them at Wesley Chapel.
with the stipulation that there should he
no general negro demonstration, "l had
enough of that at Jacksonville," the gen
eral explained.
This was distinctly promised, and the
affair was regarded as so trivial an In
cident of his visit that the newspapers
made no announcement of it. It was ex
pected that he would be driven to the
place at 10 o'clock in the morning to speak
â¢a few words of encouragement to' a score
of colored preachers, and so the enter
ttalnment committee did not choose to ac.
[company him. 1 was asked to go .with

So said Miss Walker, instructor
in physical training at the Girls' High
School, a few days ago. Â»Vt the time the
big gymnasium was filled with strong,
handsome girls < lad In bloomer costumes.
All were in a quiver of excitement, for
they were to take their first lesson ln
volley ball. . Miss Walker has just re
turned from the Kast, where the game
has a firm foothold. She saw it played at
both Wellosley and Smith lieges and be
came thoroughly versed in the game, see-
Ing Its advantages and knowing thai it
would surely prove of benefit to the girls
of -v.-! Francisco. 7
â¢'What's tin new game' like?" asked sev
eral of the girls crowding, around.
"I'll show you _ when we get down In
the yard," answered Miss Walker, "b.it
to put it briefly It is a sort of composite
between basket ball' and tennis.
"A large net is stretched across the

"First, the two teams of girls range
themselves on either side of the.net. The

Grant Tells Stories.
It was a long drive, and on the way
' Grant was more than "ordinarily com
municative, which is saying a good deal,
It was and still Is a popular fallacy that
he was in all situations a reticent man.
However self-contained he may have
been In an official capacity, socially he
was genial, cheerful and chatty. As ho
lighted a cigar, the carriage being open,
he .said:
"I have the reputation of being a hard
smoker. There are people who say my
portraits are bad because there Isn't a
cigar in my mouth. That's a slander. I
never In my life smoke.', to excess, and
now I consume only three or four slgars
a day. I am a slow smoker, and a cigar
auta me a good while.'.'
As we passed the university buildings,
the general said that If the war. had not
come when it did he should have been a
resident of the South, a professor .in a
Southern college.
"General Sherman," he exclaimed, "had
been the professor of mathematics in a
college in Mississippi"â l think It was Mis
sissippiâ"and decided to give it up. He
wrote to me at Galena, asking if I cared
to take his place. . I always liked mathe
matics; it was the study I had done best
In, and I thought I might enjoy the .work.
It was decided that I should go. but then
the rumblings of Impending war caused
me to change my mind, and with -some
reluctance 1 finally declined it."
When we were within about two blocks
of the church we were shocked by the
spectacle of a solid mass of black hu
manity. As they caught sight of the ap
proaching carriage they made a furious
rush, and with yells they surrounded us.
The two or three policemen in the neigh
borhood did all they could, but were
powerless. That the generalâ of whom It
has been said that the sudden appearance
of the enemy never surprised himâ was
surprised and alarmed by the unexpected
body of negroes; ins face bore unmistaka
ble evidence, and we soon found the sit
uation really dangerous. .
Negroes Hem Him In.
"Let us get out of this," exclaimed the
general. "Driver, turn about and go
back."
It was useless, however, to make the at
tempt, It was the determined purpose
of every man, woman and child In the
mass to shake Grant's hand or touch his
person. The air was filled with cries. A
tall old negro forced himself between the
wheels, regardless of a busy club, and
reached Grant's hand, crushing a new-
Bilk hat as he did It. Then straightening
himself to his full height, with his hands
above his bare head, lie shouted, "Kress
Gawd! I done shuck his han'l"
For nearly half an imur the scene was
beyond graphic portrayal. . These Ignor

"Why," that's easy," say a dozen voices
in chorus.
"But, say, I believe lt will be lots of
fun." whispered a pretty golden-haired
maiden to her nartner. "I am just crazy
to start." â y-yj. 7_
"Come, girls; all ready!" says Miss
Walker, at last, and then there was a
scamper for the school yard. Down the
stairs they run, laughing and screaming
for joy.
"Put the net across here," says the
teacher, "and then we will begin."
lt was an easy matter to put up the net
and In less time than It takes to tell the
two teams were ready for play.
"Now, look, girls; tills is the way."
And Miss Walker tossed the big, heavy
looking ball a few feet Into the air and
before it fell to the ground she struck
It a quick blow with her tiny fist that
sent it far over to the other side of the
Held.
Half a dozen girls ran after it. but the
ball got away from them and had to be
picked up.
Again Miss Walker served, and by a
lucky strike the ball was sent oack and
hit the ground on her side of the net.
I"lt's not as easy as it looks." one of
the players said to- another, "but it's lots
nicer than basket-ball."
And so the lesson proceeded. Before
half "an hour had passed the girls were
able to serve and return the ball with the
greatest ease, and certainly got a large
amount of exercise out of the play, for
their cheeks were glowing and their eyes
sparkling With the pleasure of good
health. ''â  y

"Now," said Miss Walker, when the
girls were fully acquainted with the game,
"the method of playing is this: In serv
ing the ball the player stands four feet
from the net on what Is called the 'drib
bling' line. She tosses the ball Into the
air and gives it a quick, decisive bat,
which sends It flying over to the other
side. It is then batted back. The side
which allows It to touch the ground ls
scored against."
Any number of girls may play, so long
as they are evenly distributed on each
side. The most satisfactory thing about
the game is the absence of roughness as in
basket ball. No tumbling over one an
other on the floor in reaching for the ball
Is possible, as the moment it touches the
lloor a certain number of points is lost to
the . side permitting it. The girls take
readily to this new form of gymnastics,
and the "Atalanta" Club, which had be
come depleted, is filling up again.

Which was rendered at the last match

as so thin and weak as to be little more
than a Squeal. With a greater volume of
voices Miss Stevenson hopes to product'
BO loud and full a sound that even the
Berkeley campus might be proud to ut
ter it. .
One tall, slender, betallored maiden re
marked the other day: "Basket ball was
so hilarious, you know, that really I was
obliged to withdraw; but now I and my
set can return to athletics without fear
of having our front teeth knocked out or
our noses broken."
Credit is due the Victor Wheeling Com
pany for the invention of this game, and
the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics,
which is connected with the Y. M. C. A.
of that city, was the first school to adopt
it. This school gives not only a thorougl
training In gymnastics, but also in phy
siology, anatomy and all allied subject
A Mrs. Hemenway, who gave to Har
vard its gymnasium, seeing the necessity
for an institution for teachers of ath
letlcs, endowed the Boston Normal School
of Gymnastics. One of the principal lec
tures of the course is "Treatment of
Emergency Cases"; another is "Anthro
pometry or Scientific Strength Testing."
* Miss Walker, the Instructor of gymnas
tics at the Girls' High School, after re
ceiving her degree of Ph.B. at Berkeley,
went fas' and took a. thorough course
in the Boston school of training. No se
rious accident to any of her girls there
fore goes unattended. At the last basket
ball game a girl was hit in the nose and
a- most annoying hemorrhage was pro
duced. Miss Walker, quickly on the scene,
whipped something out of her pocket, ap
plied it to the injured member, gave the
girl a lecture and sent her home as good
as new. ,
Miss Walker's pleasure is supreme at
seeing the girls so apt at the new game.
She says: "It ls much more agreeable to
teach volley ball than basket ball, as
there Is no danger of any girl getting
hurt. This game is Just as beneficial and
much prettier than thÂ© other.
"It ls especially adapted to them; as lt
contains those elements of skill, agility
and deftness not to be found elsewhere.
The frequent poising of the whole body
on the ball of one foot, and other posi
tions which I might mention, engender a
remarkable grace and dignity in the fig
ure. I do hope that before long other
schools and colleges will lay aside their
oasket ball for volley. As it is now we
can only play among ourselves, for we
are the only school out here that knows
anything about it.
"The beneficial exercise which exists In
a game of ball cannot be equaled by any
other kind of gymnastics. Chest weights
I consider very injurious to beginners.
They should be used only by those who
fully understand posture concepts, or the
proper position of the body, as without
this knowledge the devotee is sure to de
velop lopsidednesa.
"Under any circumstances chest devel
opers, dumbbells or Indian clubs should be
used as little as possible. Their disadvan
tage is in developing the muscles of the
chest near the arms at the expense of
those of the back. In ball or other games
the pleasurable excitement aids the res
piratory and circulatory organs, besides
hardening, and beautifying the muscles,
thereby producing the proper threefold
development of the body."
lleved Grant had come to New Orleans
for the sole purpose of "leadin' us out ob
de wilderness," as they shouted. Many
of them did not know Grant's face and
so we three were almost equally the ob
ject of adoration.
A path was made at last from the car
riage to the door, but at every step we
were obstructed and crushed by the pres
sure of the crowd. Inside the chapel door
we found .'matters hardly better. "Empe
ror William," an old negro, had charge of
the reception. He stood on the platform,
his face beaming witn fervor and per-'
splratlon, obviously speaking at the top
of his voice, but to us Ills words were in
audible. Then the choir of a hundred
voices burst forth with "De Bridegroom's
Come." The marshals, all old negro
preachers, had little' knots of their hair
tied with narrow blue ribbon, and in their
white cotton-gloved hands they held red,
white and blue batons, which they waved
wildly. Every bit of space in the church
was occupied exclusively by negroes. Not
only that, but the crowd outside had
climbed to the ''open windows, and as they
filled them entirely, not a breath of fresh
air could enter. Only a great outburst of
melody from the choir prevented a gen
eral hysteria, which was plainly immi
nent. To the singing the people kept time
with their feet and their swaying bodies.
It. was hardly conceivable that any ne
groes .In the city 'were kept ignorant of
the event, so thoroughly had the preach
ers betrayed the general. Scores of them
must have worked all night to erect the
platform' and arrange the decorations.
Over the pulpit was a huge portrait of
Grant, draped and festooned with flowers,
and opposite was a similarly decorated
portrait of Lincoln. Grant had not spoken
a word from the moment. we were fairly
surrounded by the multitude. Xow he
whispered, as he wiped his flushed face:
"I've been in Africa, but I never had as
hot a time as this."
I could not help noting that he took
little' interest in the scene and the
speeches,' but I learned the reason later.
Occasionally a seat snapped under its
heavy load. The pressure from the out
side at one of the windows became so
great that a dozen men and women were
pushed into the room, falling with shrieks
which were echoed by those upon whom
they fell.
Grant Makes a Speech.
When Grant arose to speak there was
a renewal of the cries, but the little pas
tor and the marshals soon restored quiet
enough for hts words to be heard. He
spoke briefly, saying in effect that the
colored people had their future in their
own hands. He urged them to stick to
the Bible and the spelling book and they
were bound to win the respect of all man
kind and enjoy their full share of ma
terial prosperity. To some, who evidently
expected him to announce that he had
come to consecrate himself to the restora
tion of their political rights, the speech
was apparently disappointing.
A -young negro, a teacher in the uni
versity for colored people, made a brief
hut really eloquent address.
"General Grant, he said, "you hava
been famous for epigrams that live in the
hearts of the American people. You
spoke the sentiment of a determined pa
triot people when you declared you would
'fight It out on this line If It takes all
summer.' But there was one sentiment,
nobler than all, one that has sunk deep
Into the hearts of millions. When the
landlord at Jacksonville would have
driven back the colored people as they
escorted you to your hotel, you said: 'Let
â¢them come; for where I am there the col
ored people may be also.' " jgWfil
For a moment It seemed as though the
crowd would rush on the raised platform
to lay hands on the hero, but the preach
ers, seated in the nearer pews, quickly
passed Scott Chin from his seat to the
platform. He was a tall negro, a preach
er for sixty years, born in slavery. He
seemed taller because he was thin, and
he wore an old blue army overcoat which
spread at the bottom and gradually con
tracted toward his narrow shoulders. As
his head also narrowed at the top, he waa
exactly pyramidal.
Then a" woman with the "gift of prayer"
gave an extraordinary exhibition of the
power of an uneducated mind. Before she
ceased Grant had shaken hands with the
preacher and we moved rapidly toward
the door, a path having been cleared by
the zealous marshals. We were not, how
ever, to escape so easily. When we
drew near the door the people ln the win
dows began to drop Inside and make for
the same exit to head us off. The glory
of glories was to have shaken Grant's
hand. Soon we were in the midst of the
same excited throng, and through the
door we could see a solid mass filling the
streets.
Caught in the Church.
--"Can't we get out through the back
door?" asked the general, and finding
there was such a door, we fought our
way toward- the pulpit- again. After hav
ing, our feet trodden and a hard struggle
we emerged. The driver had been shrewd
enough to. make a circuit and outwit the
crowd, and as he drew up we threw our
selves Into the carriage exhausted. The
multitude from all sides made an Impetu
ous rush after us. The foremost hurled
flowers Into the carriage, a huge bouquet
narrowly missing the general's bared
head, for he had taken off his silk hat
again, in a pitiful attempt to restore its
respectability. The horses were put to
their best gait.
"During the whole time until U had
made my speech." Grant said. "I wft9
wretched at having to speak. I never
made a speech until I was 40 years old,
and I never enjoy any occasion where I
have to do it." Then, taking off his hat
he turned and said: "Driver, take us to
a good hat store. I've got to buy a hat.
At the most important hat store in the
town there was not a hat of any fashion
that was large enough for Grant head.

nature of concerted action by the municipalities named. Local reasons have, it is true, given the inspiration; but in every place the aim is

"Old Bill" was a sort of character in

throughout the country. Personally I know of a large, number of
changes In various municipalities that were the direct result of this
action on the part of New York city, and it is only by a continuation
of these methods, 'first one city and then another, that cities can
be made officially clean, the officers of the law really to enforce it
and not to compound felonies.
I recall when the Lexow Committee came to New York city, its

his own section of the State; but he knew absolutely nothing about

could this man guide the committee in securing evidence of the
evils that bound New York city hand and foot? Nor Was it until

That committee had no idea what it was going to do, of what it was
necessary to do. â¢ '

at a hotel, would carry his own meal in
his pocket.
On a rainy day old Bill's overcoat was
a gunny sack, and his habits* were all
in line with this sort of thing. All of
this time Bill Murdock was acquiring
land, while he attended to his flocks
and sold their wool.
A cousin of William, Samuel Murdock,
came to California with his three chil
dren in 1861.
Samuel's son, Gawn W. Murdock, is
the husband of the woman who holds
the $100,000 note. *
Samuel Murdock was an illiterate
man and could neither read nor write.
He had inherited some money, and with
this small capital he and his son Gawn
went into the sheep business on Stony
Creek, near Orland, forming a partner
ship. They made money rapidly, and,
it Is claimed,- from ISCI-62 until 1877
Samuel loaned his cousin "Bill" large
sums, of money, the profits from the
business, with which money Bill pur
chased land. Gawn, the son, objected
to these loans, and bad feeling was en
gendered between father and son on
this account. It appears that no books
were kept in the matter of the partner
ship business. and the concerns of father
and son were sort of go-as-you-please.
The estrangement between them grew,
until the partnership was dissolved in
1876. Gawn agreeing to pay his father
$15,000 for his interest, $5000 of which
was then paid in cash:
It was then that Samuel left the
house of his son Gawn and went to live
with his cousin "Bill." In the early
seventies Gawn had married Mary El
len Ashurst, daughter of a farmer who
lived in Tehama County. Samuel was
on good terms with Gawn's wife.
While staying at Bill's house. Bill
told Samuel that Gawn had not made
a just settlement with him (Samuel),
and, after threats to sue, Gawn agreed
to pay his father $20,000. This was
done, the payment being in cash and
notesâ sÃooo in cash. This was a short
time before this $100,000 note was said
to have been made.
Samuel returned to his son's house
to live, and it is to Id- that all of the
old man's affections seemed centered
on his two grandsons. Edmond ' and
Stanley, Gawn's two children.
The story goes that finally- a settle
ment between the two men, Samuel
and William, came up. They met at
Gawn's house on the sth day of Sep
tember, 1877. Gawn was not at home.
The men talked over their business
transactions and it was agreed that
Sam would turn over to Bill the $20,000
paid him by his son and that William
would give a note for a balance of
$100,000. Samuel then asked to have
the note drawn up for that amount
payable to Mary Helen Murdock. to fall
due in twenty years, so as to mature
about the time his two grandsons be
came of age, the money to be for their
: benefit.
Mrs. Murdock wrote the note. Bill
signed it â and that's how and why the
note was made, according to the story.
The evidence already given in court
tells the details of the whereabouts of
the note from that time to this and
circumstances in relation to it.
Gawn Murdock, the husband of the
holder of the note, has been closely
cross-examined ' and his testimony
stands unshaken. He told of meeting
Hill Murdock at Chico a day or two
after the date of the note. Bill said
to him: "Gawn, you, needn't be mad
at me any more. I have settled with
your father. He gave me $20,000 and
I have given my note for $100,000. pay
able to Mary, twenty years after date."
Gawn returned home and his wife
showed him the note. They wrapped
it up carefully, put it in a vial, which
they then sealed, and after bottling the
vial, placed the bottle in a powder can
and buried it in the barn.
After ten or eleven years the note
was dug un and was seen by several
persons In Sacramento and in San
Franc
Gawn testified that his wife wished
to borrow money on the note from one
li. S. Megginson. He and his wife met
Megginson in the pavilion at Sacra
mento in 18M and the matter was
talked of. Bill Murdock was in the
pavilion . and they found him, intro
duced Megginson and brought up the
subject. Megginson told Bill that Mrs.
Parkhurst," said Mr. Lexow, "what is your case?" I told Mr. Lexow
that we were not presenting a case, that it was the duty of the
investigating committee to make its case, provided it could secure
the necessary evidence, and we believed that it could. AVhy, do you
know, those men actually thought that ai! they would have to do
would be to come to New York and find the evidence all ready to
place before them.
Therefore I say that your ordinary legislative committee Is, by
Itself, totally unfit to carry on an investigation of this sort. Its
members are not familial with the city. They do not know where
to look for evidence, and if their counsel happens to be as ignorant
as they it is a simple impossibility that the inquiry should amount
to anything. These investigations must and will be conducted by 1
men thoroughly familiar with the .municipality under fire. The
counsel must be a man who knows his city, who is familiar with the
ways of the police, and is too' shrewd a man to be deceived by the
subterfuges that are sure to be resorted to.
There ls more corruption in. big cities to-day than there ever
has been. There always will be corruption while the police are free
to levy tribute and the criminal and vicious classes generally un
derstand they can buy protection.' New York has been held up to
the country as the most vicious case. I say that what is true of'
the police of New York is true of the police of Philadelphia, Chicago.
Detroit, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and in fact of every
city in this country In which 50,000 persons live.
I am not making a general arraignment. AA hati I say is the
result of information which . has been communicated to me from
unquestioned sources. I doubt if people In general have noticed the
signs of action in the various municipalities. These signs are in the
form of meetings of, one sort and another, all tending to give ex
pression to popular objection to existing municipal conditions, ob- <
jections that are bound to bear fruit, and . fruit that will not be
nipped in the bud. It is. not a question of* politics or of religion!
beyond the fact that religion enters more or less into every question!
. The residents of every municipality must take a lesson from the
bosses. AVhen strife narrows down to a personal interest, the bosses
put party aside, really, and agree to act according to their personal*
interests. This ls exactly what the people* must do, and it is just
what they are eolne to do. . Take New York city as an instance of

Murdock wished to borrow some money
on his $100,000 note and he (Megginson)
wanted to know if the note was good.
.The reply was that the note was good
and would be paid when due.
The strongest testimony was that of
T. J. Kirkpatrick, a roan who lias lived
near the Murdock place for forty-three
years and who bears a splendid repu
tation. He was intimately acquainted
with both Sam and Bill Murdock and
was a Justice of the Peace in early
days and at the time the business deais
between Sam and Bill were mada,
Kirkpatrick testified that he heard a
conversation between the two men,
when Bill was trying to get a reduc
tion from 12 to 10 per cent of the in
terest rate on a note held by Mary.
He also stated that at Sam's request
he drew up an affidavit in the form of
a statement, by Sam, of the indebted
ness of William to him, giving as his
reason that he wanted to protect his
grandchildren. The affidavit was pro
duced, identified by Kirkpatrick, and
read in court. It ads as follows:

wa. I began loaning money to
the said "William Murdock in the
years of 1861 or '62, I will not say
which, and did continue to loan
to the said William Murdock my
money until 1877. The first he
borrowed from me w as money
that was left to me by my
father's estate and my brother
William Murdock, who had pre
viously died in Grisley Bend,
Butte County. I let him have
$4000 the first loan. I then loaned
him the money that I sold my
wool and sheep for from year
to year and trusted to William
Murdock to keep the accounts,
as I had no education". I think
he kept the books as correct as
ne could until the last transac
âthe settlement with Gawn
Murdock. I loaned him $5000 in
April, 1576, and when I made my
final settlement With Gawn
Murdook I loaned AVilliam Mur
dock $20,000.- September 5, 1877,
â¢ which was about two years ago.
I have settled, with William
Murdock and have taken a note
from him for the amount due

The affidavit bears the acknowledg
ment seal of Justice of the Peace T. J.
Kirkpatrick, and is dated October 31,
1879.
Trial of the big case Is now going on
before a jury at Willows. Interest and
principal now amount to nearly $350,
--000.' and each side is represented by
high-priced and clever lawyers.
' Kirkpatrick testified that Bill Mur
dock read the affidavit and said it was
all right. ,
Mrs. Helen Murdock testified that she
was at Allen Springs in 1577. In Sep
tember of that year she received word
from Samuel, her husband's father, to
return to her home at once. She did
so, arriving on the night of September
4. The next day "William Murdock came
to the house. The two men discussed
business matters alone and then Sam
uel called her into the room.
On a table were pens, ink, some pa
pers, a . blank note and many piles of
twenty-dollar pieces. A powder can
containing gold coin was near the table.
The money had been brought in to the
house by Samuel from the cellar. Sam
uel asked her to write the note, telling
her to make it .like another one he
showed her, which was for $26,000, only
to make the amount $100,000. the inter
est one per cent per month, the time
twenty years after date, payable to her
self. William read the note after she
had written it and he then signed it.
Samuel then stated that the note was
to be for the benefit of her sons, his
grandsons, when* they became of age.
the first comparison: Mr. Piatt is a Republican, Mr. Croker is a
Democrat. Ostensibly they v are bitter political foes. In reality they
work together. There was no talk of an investigation in New York
until. Mr. Piatt returned from Florida and went to Albany. Mr. Piatt
Inspired the appointment of this committee. It is stated that Mr.
Croker will be questioned by the committee. If he is the questions
will not be such as to cause him any annoyance, and if, at any time,
this Mazet investigation should reach a point where either political
party leaders would be" seriously injured it will be shelved. It makes
less difference about the small fry, but the politicians in high places
are sure to receive protection. Mr. Piatt will not allow Mr. Croker
to be personally injured. Mr. Piatt is in. power in- the Legislature.
Mr. Croker will not allow Mr. Piatt to be injured. Mr. Croker is in
power in New York city. You ask who will be injured? Why, the
people, of course. They always are when it comes to a question be
tween them and the bosses.
The time to begin an investigation is just before an election.
An investigation held at any other time is almost sure to be of small
effect. No matter how much the public learns as to how badly it
has been abused it forgets all about it in a comparatively short time.
The probe is felt. when it is inserted, but the wound soon heals and
only the scar remains. Therefore the time for punishment of those
who have wounded the body oolitic should be immediately after the
injury is discovered. It is useless to conduct an investigation that
Is not going to produce results that will benefit the people. We know
that New York's police are corrupt. AYe know that criminals buy
immunity. We know that vice is shielded because the police are
paid for shielding it. A really bona fide and searching investigation
would prove this to any one's satisfaction, because proof is plenty.
But, as I say, though all this may be laid before the public, there
is no remedy which would be effective that will be applied as long
as the municipality Is under the control, of the people who are now
in power. There would simply be a change of methods. The cor
ruption would be as great as ever.
I believe the city and country have had their fill of being ruled
by vice because of their own inaction. There never was any neces
sity for it. and there. is none now. The revolt is coming. It will be
an uprising of the people, and it will include every one of our great
cities. '...'â¢â â¢ . . â¢
The men counted the money to the
amount of $20,000. which was taken by
"William after being put into two can
vas sacks, and two notes were handed
over to William, who tore them up.
One of these notes was the one copied
from and was for $26,000: the other one
was for a smaller amount.
Under cross-examination by General
Barnes Mrs. Murdock said she was 34
years of age when the note was signed.
The number "93" on the corner of the
note she thought she copied from
another note. She was questioned very
closely as to the kind of pens and ink
used. The defense evidently puts great
stress on these points, as they will have
considerable bearing when the expert
testimony is till in.
E. L. Robinson, an attorney, testi- '
fied that he saw the $100,000 note in i
Sacramento in 1877. He was Intro- J
duced to Mrs. Murdock by a Dr. Hicks
and he heard the latter talking to
William Murdock about the note.
H. A. Skiff, at one time in the em*j
ploy of Gwan Murdock, but now a con- '
ductor for the Southern Pacific, heard:
"William Murdock say to . Mrs. Mary'
Helen Murdock in 1890: "You ought to^
be satisfied. You hold my note for'
$100,000 at 1 per cent interest."
Mrs. Matilda Glover of San Francisco â -'
was at Allen Springs in September,
1577. Mrs. Murdock was there also and
was called home suddenly. She left j
her children at the springs in care of
Mrs. Glover.
Dr. W. A. Sehorn, a dentist of Wood
land, heard the late Senator Boggs
speak of a big bill that William Mur
dock owed, soon after the latter died,
and C. B. Ashurst testified that Wil
liam Murdock told him he had a big
bill to meet before he died.
William Megginson of Ohio, in an
affidavit, testified that William Mur
dock said the bill for $100,000 was all
right and in consequence he loaned
money to Mrs. Murdock on it. This
closed the case for. th plaintiff.
In his opening address for the de
fense General Barnes said he would
prove that the note was a forgery and
mat th?" crime"- wnÂ« commuted smte
- March 12, 1390. He placed in evidence
signatures of William Murdock ad
mit., to be genuine, written at various
times between 1872 and 1893.
There is the full story and the out
line of the evidence as given up to this
time. The story seems probable, yet
the defense claim they will knock it
into splinters'.
Four famous experts on oncography
say the signature is a bungling and
barefaced forgery, and it will be
claimed, and probably testified, that old
Bill on his deathbed denied that he ever
gave such a note.
Affidavits published shortly after Bill
Murdock's death state,', that he did
positively deny the making of any such
paper.
The claim will be called absurd by the
defense, and the idea of this miserly
bachelor giving such a note to a wo
man not of his kin will bo ridiculed.
It Is a strange case. The matter of
Ih-- Gigr.'n:.' up of large tuns fiom un
der woodpiles and in out-of-the-way
lilacs is sneered at by the attorneys.
Yet such was the practice in those
days, and a hired man of old Bill Mur
dock used to tell of his once dig
gin? up while plowing $10,000 in gold
which had been buried in an old iron
pot.
What will the twelve men decide?
If Mary Helen Murdock's claim Is
held good the estate of old Bill Murdock
will be insolvent, and his last will and
testament will be just so much waste
paper.

This outburst was at last merged in
the applause that greeted the young

the figure of Lorenzo Perosi in black cas
sock could be looked upon by all, framed
in the columns of porphyry that support
the altar's gilded canopy. Here stood the
young priest, baton in hand, with his

bride was attended by her sister. Miss

Joseph Vent officiated as best man. The
bride was elegantly attired in a dress of
white organdie over white satin. The
groom is the proprietor of the Crystal
Springs Ranch dairy and son of J. Tomp
kins capitalist. The bridesmaid was at
tired in blue organdie with blue satin
ribbons and wore a corsage bouquet of
choice roses. The mother of the bride
wore a handsome black silk crepon
trimmed with white appliqued chiffon and
spangles: ornaments diamonds. Mr. and
Mrs. Tompkins took the morning train
for Del Monte, where they will remain a
week before making a tour of this State
and Nevada. They will return in a few
weeks to their new home on Post street,

be at home Thursdays. Among those

Tompkins, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Vent,
composer, that he was sent to tho Insti
tute of St. Cecilia, at Rome. Here fur
ther tuition and encouragement fell to
him. and at Ratisbon also he continued
studies which led him always to contem
plate the church and Its music. As quite
a young man Perosi was nominated to a
professorship at the Conservatory of
Parma, but inclination led him to Venice,
where, confirming vows he had already
taken, he assumed the ecclesiastical
habit.
' At Venice the priest-composer found
himself amid surroundings that brought
him constant Inspiration, and ___c How of
music, from his pen became more and
more rapid. . : As time went on, to a num
ber of- masses, motets and other church
compositions,- there came to be added the
oratorios which first won the young musi
cian a reputation outside his own imme
diate circle. Perosi conceived the idea of
illustrating in twelve of these works the
Gospel narratives of Christ's life on earth.
In quick succession four of these oratorios
have been produced: indeed, if I am not
wrong, the last twelvemonth has given
birth to all. To "La Passlone ai Cristo"
succeeded "La Transfigurazione di Cris
to"; this was followed by "La Rlsur
rezione di Lazzaro," while the latest of
the series Is "La Risurrezlone dl Cristo,"
to which Milan has just been listening.
These are the works by which, thus far,
wo have to plumb the depths of Perosi's
genius; these are the compositions which
are fast pouring the. riches of the world
into the young priest's lap, and which
have so far won hint the Pope's pat
ronage and good will that he stands 1
to-day Maestro dl Capella at the Slstlne
Chapel. Perosi, I am told, accepts his
food fortune in a calm and modest spirit,
n person he answers to a type not un-
"an Indian chief who rules in council,"
strong physically and mentally. Figure
5 is an Indian squaw who works bead
moccasins. Figure 6 is Colonel Ingersoll.
Figure 7 is George IV of England, weak,

Figure 8 is the woman type. Figure 9is
the sensitive philanthropist who dies of
overwork, and figure 10 represents tho

QUEEREST BACHELORS' CLUB
IN THE WORLD.
WAUKEGAN, 111., April 5.-There
is in this city, which is -a
thriving port situated on the
west side of Lake Michigan,
thirty-five miles north of Chi
cago, one of the most singular clubs that
has come to the notice of the reading pub
-11? for some time. It is the Waukegan
Bachelors' Club, recently brought into
prominence by the singular experience of
Its first president. Dr. AY. W. Pearce. now
Mayor of this city. Some years ago Dr.
Pearce offered a prize of $50 to the mem
! ber of the club who should first become
the father of twins. The prize was won
by Dr. Pearce himself, and this queer In
stance of a man- winning his own prize,
together with the novel nature of the
competition, has called general attention
to an organization that Is one of the
most unique in existence.
The Waukegan Bachelors' Club was in
corporated under the laws of Illinois. Au
gust IS, 1891. The Incorporators of t..e
i club were: Dr. W. AY. Pearce. J. A Car
i man, A. Lloyd Logan and J. S. Shute. It
: is an organization of men banded together
1 for social fellowship and enjoyment. Con
trary to the Inference derived from the
i name, all members of the club are not
i bachelors. Originally they were, how
ever for bachelorhood is a first requisite
: for membership. The right to marry is
I given to the members by special election,
' one being chosen every year, whether It
may be- his own desire to enter the realms
of matrimonial bliss or not. There were
; seventeen charter members, and none but
! those elected to do so has ever broken
i the solemn and fraternal vow of single
! blessedness.
The club Is composed of the best pro
! fessional and business young men of the
city, the limitation of membership to twen
ty-five being the only disagreeable feature
; in the minds of the young men who long
'< lngly desire to become "Bachelors." To
' have provided by the constitution that
j members should never marry would have
j been to attempt the impossible. So, In or-
I der that the salt In the club life might
not lose its savor, with each succeeding
1 year it was decreed that one member
should be elected' to make some woman
I happy or miserable, as the outcome might
j I.e. Cuplillan vows no not deotroy the
love each one has for his alma mater, and
! at the club he is as much of a bachelor
j as his unmarried brethren. ' y /yly
The annual meeting of the club ls Its
I red-letter day. Great anxiety over the
' election is manifested in the city as well
! as ln the club, for on that day the fate of
; some, bachelor must be settled. During
j the supreme meeting the balloting is al
ways a solemn affair. Occasionally sharp
j politics are brought into play and votes
are bunched for a particular man, but
| oftener the vote is scattering, and after
! the ballots are counted some' unsuspecting
man discovers himself suddenly thrust
Into a sphere of matrimonial necessity.
With him it is a case of tie up or lose the
claim to bachelorhoodâ paradoxical sit
uation. '
The end. of an election ts always the
! time for an elaborate celebration. The vic
j timâ for many of them take the mandate
Iln the spirit of one victimizedâ is ban

common among the Italian priesthood.
He has a clear and benignant eye, hair
that curls upward from the forehead, and
a downward twist to. the corners of his
mouth that would seem to betoken a de
termined if not an obstinate spirit.
What, then, are, the characteristics of
these new oratorios?
Chiefly, one notes the absence of set
recitatives and airs, and the preponder
ance of irregular phrases, either fluent or
declamatory, , designed to enforce the
, meaning and sentiment of the words de
livered by the soloists. Sometimes these
are supported for awhile by a consistent
Instrumental figure; sometimes the ac
companiment is more undecided in shape;
sometimes it verges on the amorphous.
The works are divided into parts, and
each part shows an abundance of sections
which, although "full closes" are fre
quent, are intended to follow one another
without a break. The choruses, many of
which have a Gregorian foundation, give
the works their chief grandeur, and must
needs be most moving in performance.
I have said that Perosi has not resisted
modern influences, and the most super
ficial examination of his music will estab
lish this fact. With a show of severe
counterpoint he mingles dissonances, some
of which are too harsh to be even touched
upon a. pianoforte and call for all the
softening that strings can give them. In
the freedom of his wanderings from key
to key. too, he follows his operatic com
patriots..-
The new oratorio is orchestrated with
none of the lavish color to which young
Italy is addicted. Perosi chooses instead
a sober and dignified manner, which be
comes his music well.
hat will Lorenzo Perosi do with his
victory? Will he remain the priest-com
poser, or will the day come when we shall
speak of him as the composer priest? Will
his church or his art hold him the faster?
Thus far the church has the mastery
Perosi has taken his triumph with becom
ing modesty, and he remains firmly set in
his intention to devote his gifts to the sole
service of his Creator. That he may con
tinue in this spirit will be the desire of all
who hear and consider his music.
upon the same base, not to speak of the
big and little triangles which represent
big and little natures. â¢ â¢
Now as to marriage. In Mrs. Huntley's
conception each side of the triangle is a
fiddle-string. If the man's psychical,
physical and spiritual sides twang In
harmony with those of a woman they
may safely marry. Unison is as unneces
sary as It is impossible.
All this is more or less intelligible, but
when reduced to practice it moans that
husband and wife. should be so constituted
as to "get along well together." j

queted and made the hero of the hour.
Thus far all who have been elected to
renounce a life of single blessedness have
succeeded before their year ran out In
convincing local or distant belles that
they are among the handsomest and best
of men. Members who have been elected
to matrimony are: J. P. Hull, W. E.

C. E. Shultls, Dr. Percival Pearce. Dr. W.
AY. Pearce, AY. I. Lyon and E. P. Bidln
ger.
Several years ago Dr. W. W. Pearce
was the choice of the club. Soon after
election day he made a trip to Boston and
brought home the intellectual bride, who
recently presented him with twins. The
occurrence was doubly Interesting, inas
much as the Mayor won his own medal,
which he says he will always be proud to
wear.
The Mayor's brother, Dr. Percival
Pearce, was elected to be married in 1895.
The summer had scarcely passed when
he led to the altar Miss Jessie Cooke,
daughter of Homer Cooke, one of Chi
cago's leading attorneys.. He met the
young lady while rusticating at the club's
summer retreat at Third Lake, in his own
county. Last year R. F. Bidinger, a
leading shoe dealer of the city, and Town
ship Assessor, was the chosen one of the
club, and he was married before the end
of the year. Another election in recent
years was William I. Lyon, who found a
lovely bride In Poughkeepsie, N. Y. He
Is a son of Hon. G. R. Lyon, a leading
member of the Illinois Legislature.
No club Is more patriotic than the Bach
elors'. When war broke out with Spain
the patriotic spirit of every member was
aroused to the highest pitch. Most of
â  them were prosperous men with business
on hand that they could not leave, yet
nil recognized the fact that they should
be represented in the conflict for Cuban
freedom. Accordingly the ballot box was
resorted to and a representative was
elected to serve in the ranks of the United
States army. A\ . C. Parker was the
choice. He Joined the Illinois Calvary,
Troop M. yy
The present officers of the Bachelors'
Club are: Cyrus Blodgett. president; Ar
thur Smith, vice president; Theodore
Durst, secretary and treasurer: "Dr. Por.
clval Pearce, chaplain.
The headquarters of the club ls at
Third Lake, in Lake County, Illinois,
where their summer houses and beautiful
grounds are situated. The Old Maid is
their famous sailboat, known as the
champion all over the string of lakes In
that vicinity.
No organization ever contained a more
sociable lot of people, and when ladies'
day at the clubhouse comes around every
year the climax of the pleasure season is
reached. Four degrees are conferred on
members by the bachelors, as follows:
Junior Bachelor. Senior Bachelor. Married
Bachelor and Most Reverend Bachelor.
The last is conferred only once in seven
years and on the chaplain alone.
. It Is to be hoped that some way will be
found of perpetuating the organization,
but with the compulsory marriage rule
in operation the name will necessarily
have to be changed some day to the an
omalous one of Married Bachelors' Club.

Mr. Halsey, the sensational nov- j

a novel of 100,000 words within a week, j
says a contributor to Tit Bits, we have j
many writers of fiction who have achieved
marvelous records as writers.
The average English novelist is content
to produce one novel a year; a feat which
cannot be despised When we consider that j
the average novel contains from one hun- j
dred and fifty to two hundred thousand j
words, .and that merely to copy it would
represent a month's hard work, writing j
five or six hours a day. Several of our j
novelists, however, have produced three, j
four, and even five of these novels in a
single year; three have a joint life record
of 230 novels; and at least two have aver
aged two and a half novels for every year
of their writing life. "7 7
In the newest school of writers S. R.
Crockett, the author of "The Stickit Min

numbers, if not In volume of his novels.
His first novel, the famous "Stickit Min

but Its success was such a stimulus to
Mr. Crockett's Industry that 1894 saw four
of Its successors, and in six years its au
thor has written and produced fifteen
novels, or almost as many as Mr. Black
more has produced In thirty-five years.
Mr. Barrle is content wjth a much slow
er rate of production. He began well by
publishing four novels .In his first two
years, but, singularly enough, his first
really successful novel, "The Little Min

Industry as a writer of fiction, for in all
the lnterevenlng seven years only two of
Mr. Barrle's novels have seen the light.

thorough and conscientious work. Last
year he produced two books, but one was
merely a collection of short stories.
Among other leading writers of fiction
who have averaged more than one vol
ume a year Is Mr. Jerome, whose record
Is sixteen novels ln eleven years. Stanley
AA'eyman, one of the most painstaking of
all our novelists, has published eleven
novels in his nine years of writing, but
he never attempted fiction until he was 35
and had lost the first fervor of youth.
Frankfort Moore has published thirty-six
novels in twenty-four years and Mrs.
Macquoid fifty-seven In thirty-seven
years.
George Gisslng is responsible for seven
teen books in fifteen years, and Rider
Haggard wrote twenty-one novels ln
seventeen years, four of which were pub
lished in 1888. In recent years the seduc
tions of country life have been stealing
over him and sapping his literary energy.
Between 1595 and 1898 he seems to have
given the world nothing in book form
from his pen.
Among the "laggards in literature" the
chief Is perhaps Olive Schrelner, whose
average rate of production ls one book
in five years. Indeed, for very many years
It seemed likely that her first brilliant
venture, "The Story of an African Farm,"
would never have a successor.
j George Meredith has produced little
more than one book in every two years of
his writing life Mrs. Humphry Ward has
been content with seven books in eighteen
years, Mr. Hardy has produced eighteen
novels in thirty-four years, or a rough
average of two years for each book, and
Mr. Blackmore's record Is very similar,
with sixteen novels ln more than twice aa
as many years.
Of our older writers Mr. Henry takes
the palm for Industry, with a record of
over one hundred books, and is followed
by Miss Braddon, with fifty-seven novels
in thirty-eight years.BEAUTY

Â£â Ââ3 HERE is nothing that so de
lights a woman's senses as a
faint, delicate perfume. It Is as
dear to her heart as the rustle
li> of a silk petticoat, or the sparkle
of her first engagement ring.
There is nothing gui! so closely mingled
with our inner consciousness as a partic
ular fragrance. That there is a strange
connection between perfume and our men
tal processes we all know, for who has
not at the faintest Odor of a certain
flower or perfume had memories Invoked
that wakened in the mind like Actual re
vivals of the past, bringing back all the
hopes and heartthrobs associated with
them years ago?
The art of making perfumery has been
practiced since time immemorial. Even
In this progressive age the art has not
fundamentally changed, and I really
doubt if modern perfumers can excel the
oils and pomades and precious ointments
of the days of -. raby the Blest.
The amateur perfumer Is not always
successful, as appliances and a knowledge
of how to use them are necessary. And,
too, when you can purchase for really
a very small sum a bottle .of perfumi*
that has been made by the greatest per
fumers in the world, and has been im
proved by having been kept for years in
a cellar in Paris, it would seem foolish
to try to emulate it in a saucepan or
over a gas stove, and prohably get a red
nose into the bargainâ now. wouldn't it?
Sachet powders and other fragrant
toilet accessories can be made at home,
however, if you will take a little pains
and carefully follow directions.
The true gentlewoman never uses strong
rerfumes, and yet her clothing and her
person are impregnated with a subtle
fragrance that is wafted across one's
tenses with a suggestion of soft winds
that blow over a meadow of wild vio
lets.
Select your favorite perfume and carry
It out in every detail. Make sachets of
all sizes suitable for every article of dress
as well as for closets, wardrobes and
bureau drawers. When the skirt and bod
ice of your gown have been brushed and
t repaired after wearing, place one of these
sachets between the folds. Also let one
of these little bags of sweetness find its
way into the corner of your hat. another
in among your handkerchiefs and gloves
and still others In the drawers of your
dresser, where lie dainty linen garments
and pretty hosiery. A tiny sachet is also
pinned Inside the corset. Say that the
scent chosen has been violet. A perfectly
delightful sachet is made from the follow
ing formula:
Violet Sachet, .
Black currant leaves, powdered,
one-fourth pound.
Rose leaves, one-fourth pound.
Cassia buds, one-eighth pound.
Orris, ground, one-half pound.
Gum benzoin, one-eighth pound.
Grain musk, powdered, one-fourth
dram.
Mix thoroughly and let stand for
one week.
Then If you can afford it use the expen
sive imported violet soaps, although as a
matter of beautifying there is nothing
better than the pur- castile soap, the
odor of which can be done away with
by using a little violet toilet water ln the
bath. . â¢* *
For those who are particularly luxur
iously inclined the following bath bags
will be a delight:
Violet Bath Bags.
Two pounds of finely ground oat
meal; one can of almond Hour. one
cake of best white castile soap,
shaved fine; one-quarter pound
powdered orris root. Take one yard
of cheesecloth and make it into lit
tle bags and fill with the mixture.
After using these, which will make
a soft, white lather, rinse the face,
neck and arms in vat. containing
a few drops of benzoin.
An excellent tooth powder to be used at
the me time Is-
Diet Tooth Powder.
One-fourth pound of prepared chalk,
finely powdered, three-fourths ounces
pulverized castile soap; one ounce
powdered orris root; one-half dram oil
of sassafras; one ounce pulverized
sugar.
Poucl re de Violet.
Talcum powder, seven and one-half
ounces. . *
Finest starch, one and one-fourth
ounces.
Powdered orris root, one and one

Oil of orris, ten drops.
Do not use liquid perfume on your hand

lobes of the ears and the eyebrows is per
missible, but not a drop on any article
that you wear or carry. It Is considered
very bad form.
A few drops of essence of violet in your
face powder and in your cold cream will
add to your galaxy of sweet odors. You

LILLIE Câ My advice to your husband
would be to consult a skin specialist. lb*
probably needs a good blood tonic as well
as local remedies. If he will take the
trouble to give his face a good scrubbing
each night with a brush, warm water and
castile lap the blackheads will certainly
be benefited.
L. M. Have sent you the addresses
you asked for through the mail. You ask
for a remedy for a shiny nose. This af
fliction is pretty sure evidence of too
much oils and fats taken Into the sys
tem. So the first thing to do ls to abstain
from all rich and indigestible foods. Eat
plenty of fruit' and drink mineral waters.
The following lotion used in the water
with which you rinse, your face will
counteract the excessive shlniness of the
skin; Alcohol, four ounces ; ammonia, one
ounce, and oil of lavender, one dram. Mix
by shaking in a six-ounce bottle. Do not
use more than one scant teaspoonful of
this in two quarts of warm water. Di
rections for making the orange flower
skin food were given in last Sunday's
Call. I cannot tell you just how long It
will take the peroxide and ammonia to
do its work. Months probably.
FAIRFIELD I could not send you a
personal reply. I have so many requests
of that kind it is Impossible to grant
them. Coeoanut oil is not good for the
hair. You need something in the wav of
an irritant to start it to growing. "Try
the following: Four ounces eau de co
logne, one-half ounce tincture cantha
rides and one-fourth dram each of oil of
lavender and oil of rosemary. Apply to

real cure I know of for blackheads is the
use of the complexion brush, warm water

even' night. Immerse the brush in warm
water, rub the soap on until you get a

at night, just before going to bed. If>ou

not longer. As there are also pimples, it
would be wise to get rid of these before
beginning the face-scrubbing process. Be

MILDRED M.â Formula for orange
flower skin food was given in last Sun
day's Call. As far as the hair-producing
property of cold cream is concerned, you
can feel absolutely secure in using a
cream that contains neither lanoline nor
coeoanut oil. These oils.ln their pure state
are both excellent hair growers, although
when combined with other ingredients, -*s
ln the skin food, are comparatively safe.
Do write to me again and ask me all
those other questions that are worrying
you. SsÂ£-Pe_B
A. N. M.â ln massaging the lines about
the mouth smear the skin first with some
good emollient cream and then knead
and smooth the little lines, rubbing al
ways across the wrinkles. If you will
send me a stamped addressed envelope I
will send you the address you desire. â¢
UNHAPPYâ I am afraid I can give you
but little comfort concerning the Super
fluous hairs. The preparation that you
mention and others of a like nature
merely banish the hairs for the time be
ing by burning them off to the surface of
the skin. Ammonia slightly diluted will
have the same effect. Bui the hairs will
return and possibly coarser than before.
There is positively nothing but the elec
tric needle that will destroy them per-,
manently. Peroxide of hydrogen will
bleach them white.
PAN S^â As long as you continue to
wear nigh collars you will no doubt be
distressed by that discoloration about the
neck. It can be bleached out by applying
pure lemon juice each night. ! After It has
dried on the skin rub thoroughly with cold
cream. Bathing the eyes with diluted
Witch hazel will often do away with the
dark circles under them. For the profits
perspiration, use a little of the lavender
lotion suggested to L. M. R. in the water
in which you bathe the armpits and after
thoroughly drying dust with a powder
made of one part boracic acid, two parts
precipitated chalk aud seven pari*** of
powdered talcum. This will surely help
you. There certainly is no Improprirty
in asking your married friend fn- a pho

as a compliment if mad.- in a I L. .... way.
DAISY D. M.I have never heard of
the cream you mention, so cannot advise
you about it. The best rouge is made by
incorporating a small quanlty of pow
dered carmine In a little cold .ream
Keep the ends of your hair well trimmed
and apply the following tonic for the
dandruff: Forty-eight grains resorcln
one-half ounce glycerine- and alcohol
enough to fill a two-ounce bottle Annlv
every night, rubbing it well Into the
scalp. Send me a stamped addressed en
velope and I will tell you where you can
procure the complexion brush.
E. A. E.â As you are afraid to use any
thing containing oil on your skin why
not try thick, pure cream. It is' ver'v
whitening and will also make the skin
wm,.? ; velyety. and if well rubbed in
will utterly discourage wrinkles. Use this
at night, and in the daytime apply the
following astringent wash: Take a half
pint bottle and place in It three table
spoonfuls, of fresh, uncooked cucumber
juice. Half till the bottle with el er
flower water and then add two table
spoonfuls of eau -de cologne. Shake well
and add very slowly half' an ounce of
simple tincture of benzoin, shaking the
mixture no Â«T aid then. Fill the bottle
with elder flower water ' Let "'l* on
the skin. Advise me as to the result of
this treatment. Peroxide of hydrogen
with a , little ammonia added, will bleach
the hairs so that they will be much less
noticeable ami will no- injure the skin
in any way. I have no faith in the ef
licac- of face masks.
AN INQUIRER-The flushing in your
case is probably caused by an overheated
condition of the blood. Eat plenty of fruit
and crisp green-salads and drink freely of
mineral waters. These re cooling to the
blood. The astringent wash, formula for
which is given in reply to "E. A E " I
think will help you also, and the orange

the skin. It was the" glycerine in the lo

Which are most injurious to 'the skin
A little rice powder lightly applied after
rubbing the least little bit of cold cream
on the face will cool the skin and reduce
the redness to some extent. If applied

the costumes is described as being made
in white cloth, but they would be equally

The first model Is composed of a SKiri
very flat and forming a fourreau which
widens at the bottom into crushed^ pleats
and a train. It is trimmed round the bot
tom with three rows of stitching -in reg

corsage and corners at the bottom of the
tunic are trimmed with designs cut out
in perforated cloth and laid on over white
taffetas. The sleeves arc flat and trimmed
with stitched wristbands. Beneath the
corsage is a kind of large double-breasted
waistcoat, which comes down to tno
knees. It can be made either of cream
white velvet or taffetas embroidered all
over with gold thread, with round but

THE fan will play an important part
in the summer girl's campaign. It is
the- chief weapon of defense against
mosquitoes, and for the purpose she
will use the palm leaf fan. But for the
less serious purpose she will use one of
the new and exquisite designs.
The new fans are from 9 to 10 inches
in length", the tiny empire fan not being
as popular as it was several seasons ago.
There are many pretty chiffon fans, one
having a pretty, pastoral scene painted
upon it. Another of white chiffon has sil
ver spangles decorating it. One very
unique fan is made or silk, upon which are
appllqued designs in Chantilly lace, and
alternating with the lace medallions are
pretty little hand-painted figures; the in
laid sticks are painted and spangled. A
pale cream-colored silk fan, elaborately
ornamental with figures in the style of
the V.ernis Martin fans, is among the
most* expensive. Paillettes of shining
steel are used to sew the delicate pat
terns of flower sprays appliqued - on "the
net and chiffon. ' -
Black fans, black and green and black
and violet seem to be the popular colors.
There are many pretty commencement
fans and- wedding fans, which, of course,
are white. Chains are much used, and.the
pretty Japanese fans are almost as beau
tiful in design as the expensive silk and
lace.

Woman to-day seem to have acquired
a magpie taste for "all that glitters."
Jeweled ornaments are more than ever
the rage, beeds and. spangles are worked
up into a melange With cut. steel and
pearls, and the complex mixture shines
forth on .various parts of gay costumes.
A new collar is made out of fringe of
fine pearls, falling all around the neck.
Occasionally the fringe has the threads
graduated in length, so that they reach
clear to the bust in front and are tapered
off on either side. The shower of pearls
is sometimes arranged. to a velvet collar,
or for a decollete goWn they may depend
from a single rope of pearls around the
neck, and are accounted most coquettish
in that they sway gently at every breath.
The velvet collars or stocks are mostly
black, but sapphire, ruby and amber are
sometimes preferred. Collars of this kind
with the swinging fringe, it is prophesied,
will displace the long pearl chains that
have been so much worn. They are not
intended exclusively for full dross; on
the contrary, they, are more particularly
admired over silk blouses and all kinds
of pretty loose silk waists, such as one
would wear to the theater.
There are collars also that are made
entirely of steel, in fine cut heads, ar
ranged in squares, and with pearl and
steel pendants.

A $5,000,000
SHAWL
THAT India, after a foreign* occupa
tion of some centuries, and in spite
of the apparent poverty of the
great bulk of the people, is still
probably the greatest treasure house on
earth is due to the fact that for ages it
was, with Ceylon and Burma, the field
which supplied the rest of the world not
only with gold, costly fabrics and spices,
but with precious stones, the finest speci
mens of which, however,- were ever re
tained by the Hindoo and Mogul Princes
for their own personal adornment.
One of the jewel treasures of th" Indian
Princes, that of the Gashwar of Baroda,
is perhaps the most remarkable, being
appraised by experts a few years ago at
the immense sum of three crors of rupees,
or (15,000,000. Among his collection his
chief diamond necklace, worn on state oc
casions, contains the "Star of the South,"
a Brazilian stone weighing 254 carats, for
which $400,000 was paid, the whole neck
lace being valued at forty lacs of rupees,
or $1,000,000. The masterpiece in his pos
session, however, is a wonderful shawl
composed entirely of inwrought pearls
and other precious stones worked in the
most harmonious and artistic arabesque
patterns, and which actually cost the ex
traordinary price of $5,000,000. >
This shawl was Intended as a present to
cover the tomb of Mohammed, but when
it was finished the Gashwar thought twice
of the idea and kept it himself. While it
is true that the native jewelers as a rule
care less for the purity and commercial,
value of the stones than for the general
effect produced, yet their artistic feeling
and skill in setting gems, often but poorly
cut and polished, cannot be surpassed:
As evidence of this, a comb of matchless
workmanship was presented to the Prince
of Wales by the Raja of Jaipur. Another
present which the Prince of Wales re
ceived on his visit to India in is;., was a
SWOrd from the Maharaja of Kashmir, set
with diamonds and emeralds valued at
$25,000. in addition to which there was a
solitaire diamond in the belt worth $10,000.

ESTHETIC
CU RL PAPERS
WOMAN has at last found a way
out of the difficulty of making a
fright of herself with curl pa
pers. Doing up one's hair on re
tiring has always been a per
plexing problem to those who eschew hot
irons, for even in the sancity of isola
tion one does not like to feel herself a
fright.
With a due knowledge of feminine cap
rice, some enterprising manufacturer has
sent out a curl paper, which- ties around
the desired curl with a dainty bow of
ribbon, so that when the bang or pompa
dour is arranged for the night "the head
looks as if surrounded by a halo of pretty
ribbons and floating 'ends'.
Half the horrors of a fire in an apart
ment house are thus done away with, for
the harrowing sight of curl papers has
always added to the other terrors in no
small degree: sleep walking can now be
as graceful as a scene from "Macbeth,"

SPRING
COLORS.
FASHION makers say that from
Paris comes the seal of approval
on all shades of violet, coral and
national blue , for new spring
dresses, and that holding prime favor is a
very bright rendering of the periwinkle
tint, a combination of cream and any of
the paler tones of beige.
In millinery violets and blues certainly
hold the palm. For a touch of color in
an otherwise all black hat coral seems to
be the favorite.
Beautiful shades of violet and blue
cloths are to be used for dressy costumes,
and the. newest foulards and India silks
are shown in those two colorings, be

STANFORD PARLOR, N. S. G. W.
Stanford Parlor had a very pleasant
meeting last Tuesday night and the pleas
ure was heightened for the large number
of members present by the friendly visit
of Grand Trustee Judge Fletcher A. Cut
ler of Eureka, Humboldt County, a. stanch
admin of Stanford, who during the even
ing gave one of his admirable and inter
esting talks.
The parlor elected to membership H. M.
Owens, J. 1-*. Nolan, D. E. Behlow and J.
F. Murphy, and at the next meeting, when
initiatory work is performed, these gen
tlemen will bo taught the mysteries or the
order.
The members of this O. K. parlor have
for a long time been preparing for the
1900 celebration, and they have discovered
that to make as great an event as that
will be a success the help of ladies is a
necessity. To secure their help in the
matter it has been decided to form an
auxiliary composed of the lady relatives
of the members, who are to aid' in the. so
cial part of the affair. A committee of the
most gallant members has been appointed
to arrange for this auxiliary.
During the evening Fred H. Jung, sec
retary of the parlor, read an interesting
letter he received irom Arthur H. Clif
ford, a member of the parlor now at Ma
nila, commissary sergeant of the First
Regiment of California Volunteers, In
which he returns thanks for the kindness
of the parlor In its remembrance of tho
members who are in the service. He
gives a resume of the work of the Cali
fornia boys and adds: "Revenge is strong
in the Malays, and I do not suppose that
they will ever forget their first battle with
the Americans; but we must put a good
finish on what we have before us ana In
still Into their dull Drains that they can
not bear arms against such a powerful
Government as that of the United States."
Relative to the climate he writes: "The
writing of a letter is but a short time to
bestow on those who have proved so kind,
yet this tropical climate seems to draw
all usefulness from one. I confess that

the man:
"What's the matter with your baby? , *
"Hey?" responded the nan. "Want a ride? Of course you can ride;
climb up. I ain't got time to stop." , â,,
"I said what's the matter with the baby, the baby In the wagon?
cried Buster John at the top of his voice.
"In the waggin? Oh, yes! Well, get in."
"Don't you do it, brother," Bald Sweetest Susan. "He heard what you
said "
The man looked at them with twinkling eyes. "Oh, both want to ride.
Well, get Inâ that's all I've got to say."
Buster John was not to be put down that way: he was very close to
home nowâ in fact, he could see the tall form of his grandfather standing
on the knoll above the spring watching the covered wagon with curious
eves, for it had been a long day since one had come along that road going
in that direction. So Buster John grew very bold Indeed. He went close
to the front wheel of the wagon, close to the heels of the off mule.
"You know what I said. I asked you what was the matter with the
baby In the wagon."
The man seemed to rouse himself. "Baby In the waggin! Why. they
ain't no baby in there; it's a cat I picked up on the way. She's a mouser.
We need mousers where I'm a-goln'."
Buster John, more indignant than ever, ran ahead, called his grand
father and asked him to go and see about the baby in the wagon, telling
him hurriedly how queerly the man had acted.
But the White-haired Master shook his head. "He's only playing with
you." he said.
The children were in despair at this, for they were sure something was
wrong. Even Aunt Minervy Ann had said so. Buster John began to pout,
Curious Burying Ground
Where Bodies Are Piled High.
OUT to the northwest of Manila, between two steep hills, some of our soldier boys came upon the eloquent pile of
bones which their camera has, brought home. The view is but a portion of the bones which lie in the sun for whom
soever will to carry away or desecrate without let or hindrance. They are the bones of the wealthy Spaniards, who,
by paying a large bonus, hoped to rest in exclusive seclusion till what their spirits left behind returned to first
principles. A hundred rods beyond . this pile of bones is built In the rock a species of catacomb in the sheer walls
forming the sides' of the hill and making a natural rounded blind valley. Tombs are cut out of the rock and rented
to those who can afford It at the rate of $30 for the first year and $30 every five years forever after. 'Ihe rent must be
Invariably, paid In advance, and if.lt Ib not forthcoming the bones are pulled out of the tomb and dumped upon the bone
pile. The simpler Filipinos and impecunious Spaniards are laid to rest in the cemetery Just outside of Manila.
and Sweetest Susan was ready to cry. She looked appeallngly at her
grandfather, her eyes swimming in tears.
"What is it, Sweetest?" the White-haired Master inquired.
,_,, That poor little baby," she said, controlling herself the best she could;
"111 dream about it all night."
"Well, don't cry; we'll see about it," remarked the grandfather sooth
ingly.
Hy this time the wagon had come up. The driver bowed politely and
would have gone on, but the White-haired Master motioned him to stop.
11 his he did, but with no good grace. He pulled up his mules and sat on
the seat expectantly; with a grin in his face that was half a scowl.
â¢ "You come from Mllledgeville way?" the children's grandfather In
quired. 'M-'.y
"Who told you?" the man asked quickly; "them children there?"
"No," said the White-haired Master, frowning a little. "I was simply
Inquiring."
The man laughed. "Well. I come from that-a-way."
"What news?" asked the White-haired Master.
"Lots an' lots; I couldn't tell you in a week. The wide world is turned
end up'ards. Murderin', riot, bloodshed, burnin', -rippln', rarin', roarln',
snortin'. You know what?" -..*.:
The man closed his restless, roving eyes. "Well, down yon way they're
tarln' up the railroad tracks while the brass ban' plays. I ketched 'em
a doln' of it, an' I danced wi' 'em 'roun' the fire a time or two, an' then
I picked up this waggin and mules and come on 'bout my business."
The man wagged his head up and down, and rolled it from side to side,
and shifted his glances, and giggled in a very excited manner. The chil
dren's grandfather tried to find some basis for the man's strange actions;
tried to duplicate them In his memory, but failed. Then he asked:
"What have you in your wagon?"
"Well, fust an' last, I've got some few bed cloze and some few ruffage
for the mule. : an' thenâ well, yes. there's a -cat I picked up, a reg'ler
mouser. She growls, but there ain't nothin' the malter wi' 'er."
In response to this statement the wagon cover was lifted high enough
for the child to put its head out. Its little face was distorted wih fear or
despair.
"Me am' no tat!" she cried; "my mammy say I'm her 'Itty bitsy baby;
my daddy say I'm his big 'itty man; my nunky tall me Billy Bistit. Oh,
pease lift me outer here. Me wanter see my daddy an' mammy!" The
child had cried and screamed so much that its voice had a harsh -md un
natural sound. It pierced the tender heart of the White-haired Master
like a knife and roused him to a fury of indignation.
"Is that what you call a cat, you trifling scoundrel?" he cried. He
passed through the gate and was now close to the man.
"That's what." answered the man with a chuckle. "He'll bite, an'
he'll scratch, an' he'll growl. He also calls himself Billy Biscuit, but do he
look like a biscuit? You wouldn't want me to call him a chicken, would
you?" < -;
He stuck out his tongue as he said this and looked about as foolish as
it Is possible for a grown man to look, and the grandfather's Indignation
changed to a feeling of amazement and disgust.
"Is the child yours?" he asked.
"Why, whose should he be. mister? You'd be errytated ef you wuz a
youngster an' had to ride all day in a klvered waggin; now wouldn't you?"
The observation was a just one, considering the source; and though it
lacked feeling and sympathy, the White-haired Master could make no
reply.
"This is a likely place to campâ there by the spring." the man re
marked. "Ef I thought I mought be so bold as to ax youâ"
"You may," said the White-haired Master. "Drive in the gate here
and unhitch under the trees yonder. There's fire under the washpot.
You'll find plenty of wood to start it up, but be careful about it: don't
burn any of the fencing."
The man drove in as directed, turned his wagon round, the tongue
pointing to the gate, unhitched his mules, watered them without taking
the harness off and then gave them two bundles of fodder apiece to munch
on. Then he got out his frying pan, his skillet and his coffee pot and
finally proceeded to kindle a fire.
Buster John'and Sweetest Susan watched all these proceedings with
great Interest, especially as the man paused every now and then to talk
to himself. "Yes. that's me," he declared over and over again; "Roby
Ransom, corridor 1, room 9."
He paid no attention to Buster John and Sweetest Susan nor to Drusilla,
who Joined then* as the wagon drove in the gate, and he seemed to have
forgotten the child in the wagon. But Sweetest Susan had not forgotten
it. She stood by th-3 wagon arid saw the little one looking at the man with
scared eyes. â¢"ââ¢
The whole affair was very interesting to the children. The big trees
had been a favorite resort for campers, in old times, and the youngsters
vaguely remembered Beeelng strange men sitting around the fire frying
bacon that sent forth a very savory odor, but of late years there had been
no campers there. The campers and wagoners, like most of the able
bodied men. had been camping out under the tents of the army or sleep
ing as Johnny Banter put it. "under the naked canopies." Therefore this
mysterious man was the first camper who had kindled a fire in the spring
lot since Buster John, Sweetest Susan and Drusilla had been of an age to
aporeclate ,the circumstance.
Consequently they watched him closely, and in comparative silence,
their comments being confined to low whispers. Sweetest Susan's solici
tude was for the child in the wagon, but her curiosity compelled her to
keep sharp eyes on the man. who went nervously about his business, and
very awkwardly, too, as even the children could Bee. Sweetest Susan's
solicitude was rewarded, for. as she leaned against the frame of the wagon.

the child on the inside reached its soft little hands out and patted her
gently on the arm. To Sweetest Susan this was more than a caress, and
she seized the small hand and held it against her cheek for a moment.
Then she made bold to ask the manâ called him Mr. Ransom at a ven
tureâif she might bring the little one some supper.
"Who told you my name?' the man asked with suspicion in his eyes.
"I heard you call yourself Roby Ransom," replied Sweetest Susan very
"We'll, you heard right for once," he said. "Supper for the young un?
Tooby shore; fetch it. I didn't allow I'd take in boarders when I started,
an' I ain't got any too much vlttle^for myself."
So Sweetest Susan and Drusilla went to the house to arrange for bring
ing the child some super, while Buster John lagged behind and watched
the man till the bell rang. Meanwhile the grandfather had told his daugh
ter (the mother of Buster John and Sweetest Susan) about the child in
the wagon, and that lady was in quite a fume about it. At first she in
sisted en going down and taking the child away from tho man; she was
sure there was something wrong. '*â¢,*_":.
"There may be." said the White-haired Master, "but we are not sure
about It. and we might make bad matters worse. There s plainly some
thing wrong about the man: that much is certain; but the child may be
his and it may be badly spoiled. No, it would be wrong to interfere with
him :. l've thought it all over." ' . .-- '..- ââââ,,, mo i,~ â¦Â»,__,
"If you'll take my advice," remarked his daughter, you 11 make the
negroes tie the man and lock him in the corn crib until we find out some
thing about him." -'â Vy
"That would hardly be legal." said the old gentleman. >;
"Well I don't think there is much law in the country at this time, the
lady Insisted. "If we knew he had stolen the child, what could you do with
"What you say is very true," remarked the White-haired Master,
"truer even than you think it is.- Still there is no reason why we should
be hasty and unjust." , ... , , , _.Â»._. o _i_-
As the lad* was convinced against her will, she remained of the same
opinion still, and that opinion became a conviction when Sweetest Susan
arrived and told all she saw and all she thought. But there was nothing
to be done but to give the child one full meal If it got no more, and so the
lady set about fixing supper for the unfortunate. She piled a pla.e hgn
with biscuits and ham and chicken, and when the children were through
supper they waited impatiently for Drusilla to finish hers, so they could all
go together. Sweetest Susan Insisted on carrying, the plate herself.
When they arrived at the camper's fire they found the man eating
supner by himself.
"Where's the baby?" asked Sweetest Susan. .-..--* ;-â¢.
--"In the waggin." replied the man curtly. "T wanted to take the imp
out. but he wouldn't let me tech him. Git him out if you can."
The child needed no coaxing when Sweetest Susan called him. He
crawled to the front of the wagon and held out his arms to her and he
hugged her so lightly around the neck that It was as much as she could
do to climb down without falling. The little fellow was well dressed, but
he was barefooted, and his feet were very cold.
"Where are his shoes?" asked Sweetest Susan, Indignantly. â 
"He must 'er pulled 'em off and flung 'em away. Oh, he's a livln ter
ror, he is. Don't you let him fool you." Â«,<__,â,.Â»*
The child ate his supper, sitting in Sweetest Susan's lap, and he seemed
to be very hungry. He tried to make Sweetest Susan eat some, too, and
once or twice he smiled when she pretended to be eating ravenously. But for
the most part the child kept his eyes fixed on Mr. Ransom, and clung more
tightly to Sweetest Susan whenever he caught the man looking at him.
The result of it all was that when the time came for the children to go
to the- house Sweetest Susan found it impossible to get rid of the child.
He wouldn't allow Ransom to take himâ seemed ready to go into con
vulsions whenever the man approached: and, finally, in order to Induce him
to get into the wagon Sweetest had to go in with him (accompanied by
Drusilla) and once there she was compelled to lie by the child until it
dropped off to sleep. He held her hand tightly clasped in his tiny fists.
Buster John was impatient, and said he was going to bed, and Sweetest
Susan told him to tell mamma that she and Drusilla would come as soon
as the baby went to sleep. Drusilla. drowsy eyed, lay down on the bed
clothes and was asleep before the child was. Sweetest Susan made every
effort to withdraw her hand and slip from the wagon, but these move
ments aroused the child and set it to whimpering.
Everything was very still; even the frogs called to one another drow
sllv ' The mules had cleaned up their ration of fodder and were now doz
in"' Under these circumstances it was not long before Sweetest Susan was
as sound asleep as Drusilla. and apparently the child was asleep too.
' Ransom in due time arose from the flre where he had been sitting, went
to I- ,'â  rear of the wagon and looked In. and then stood listening Intently.
Nothing was to be heard but the regular heavy breathing of three sound
Bleeoers He went to the spring, got some water and carefully put out the
fire At no time had it been a large one. Then stealthily, almost noise
less'lv he put the mules to the wagon, drove out at the gate and Into the
nubile road Once Sweetest Susan dreamed that she was going to town
n the wagon with Johnny Bapter; but that must have been when the
wagon was going down the long and steep hill that led to the Crooked
Creek
An hour after the wagon had disappeared Mrs. Wyche. the children s
mother aroused herself from thoughts of her husband who was in tho
army and remembered that it was long past the time for Sweetest Susan
to be in bed". She called to Jemimy, Drusllla's mother, who was nodding
by the fire in the dining room. .-. y

NIANTIC PARLOR, N. S. G. W.
Last Tuesday night Niantie Parlor, Na
tive Sons of the Golden West, celebrated
Its twelfth anniversary by an at home
to members and their lady relatives and
friends. Shasta Hall. Native Sons build
ing, in which al 1 assembled, was not
large enough to accommodate all who
wished to enjoy the programme prepared
for their -entertainment. Henry Millzner j
made a few introductory remarks, after |
which there were vocal solos by Mrs. j
Robert McLav, John Ross and R. Ray; a ,
zither solo by Leo Edelman. and recita
tion by Mrs. T. Barton. Then followed
dancing and the serving of icecream and
cakes. The committee that provided for â¢
the evening was Frank Mordecal. J. B.

short visit to Paraiso Springs. Miss Ma

last week for Crescent City, where she
will remain for some time with her sister,
who is also a member of the parlor.
On the evening of the loth Inst.
Fremont Parlor gave a fishpond party in
the Native Sons' banquet hall for the
benefit of the Native Daughters' Home.
There was a good attendance, and those
who were there were liberal in purchas
ing fish. It is expected that the affair
has raised a neat sum for a deserving
cause In addition to the fun created by
fishing there was a good programme of :

COMPANIONS OF THE F. OF A.
Under the direction of Mrs. B. Harris,
Miss Kate Campbell, Mrs. Hartwick,. Miss
A. O'Keefe and Mrs. Giebeau, Live Oak
Circle, recently gave a social in the Social
Hall of the Alcazar, which proved to be
one of the mest enjoyable functions that
this wideawake circle has ever given.
There was a good attendance and tho
programme of dances was a well selected
one.
On the night of the 10th Inst, the grand
chief companion paid his official visit to
Loyal Circle in Oakland and was greeted
with a genuine welcome by the members
and visitors. There were present the
frand eubschief- companion, Mrs. Flora
acobs; the grand financial secretary,
Miss Agnes D. Bremer- the grand record
ing secretary, Mrs. L. Atwood; Grand
Trustee Mrs. A. Davis, Past Grand Chiefs
Mrs. Duke and Mrs. Carah and repre
sentatives from many of the local circles
and some from the Alameda County cir
cles. After the close of the business there
were speeches by the grand officers and
others, and during the evening the grand
chief was given by the circle as a token
of appreciation of his efforts on behalf of
the order a gold-back brush, and to the
grand subchief there was presented a
beautiful floral token. There was a col
lation and a general good time.
On the night of the 13th Inst. Indepen
dence Circle, which was Instituted on the
Sth of last December with a membership
of twenty-three, was visited officially by
Grand Chief Companion Coburn, and he
was greeted by a large number of the
members of the order. The work of Ini
tiation was performed in a very pleasant
manner by the officers, and at the close
the announcement was made that Ih ad
dition to the five who were admitted to
membership on that night the circle had
since its institution -added forty-two
strangers to its membership, a very good
showing in that space of time. For the
entertainment of the members and vis
itors as well as the grand officers there
was an adjournment to the Social Hall of
the Alcazar, where twenty-one members
of the circle, who had blacked up, gave
a pleasing minstrel show and cake-walk,
that being followed by a collation ln the
banquet hall. There the circle, to show
its approval of the course of the grand
chief companion, presented him a very
pretty dressing case, Then thero was tho
presentation by the circle to its deputy,
Mrs. K. A. Haughy, grand treasurer, of a
fine pair of opera glasses in a. velvet
bag, as an expression of tho approval of
her work for the circle.
On the night of the 15th Inst. Inter Nos
Circle No. 215 had a Jolly domino party in
the Alcazar Social Hall. The largo at
tendance gave proof that Tnter.Nos Is
still one of the popular circles of
the order. Many were in costume,
some pretty, some original 'and many
plain and ordinary, but all served the pur
pose of concealing the Ideality of the
wearers until the time for unmasking.
The evening was most enjoyably spent.
There was a good programme of up-to
date dances.
Bonita Circle will give a social ln Man
gels' Hall on the 27th Inst.
The farmers' party that was recently
given by Robin Hood Circle was very well
attended and was one of the most enjoy
able functions that this enterprising sub
ordinate has ever given. Everybody was
jolly, and the only regret was that the
hour for "Home, Sweet Home" came too
soon.
THE CHOSEN FRIENDS.
The recent session of the Grand Council
held in this city revealed one of the pecu
liarities of fraternity. Grand Councilor
Boehm served three years consecutively I
as the head of the order and during that j
time devoted a great deal of personal at- i
tention to it, visiting many councils, giv
ing advice, and so forth. After his re
port, which had been referred, was adopt
ed, some representative made eulogistic
remarks about the earnest and arduous
work of the grand councilor, and then
moved that the grand body prove Its ap
preciation of his work by a rising vote.
Such a vote was given. Subsequently
there was a call for the election of five
representatives to the Supreme Council,
and, as was expected, the grand councilor
was nominated, and, as it was also ex
pected, that in view of the compliment
paid by a rising vote, that on the first bal
lot he would be rewarded for his services
by an almost unanimous vote for supreme
representative; but on that ballot he
fell short two of being elected, and on the
four other ballots he did not receive
enough votes to send him to the supreme
body. That was a case of tendering an
officer an empty honor.
The reception that was tendered by Ev
ans and Golden Gate councils to the grand
officers and representatives to the Grand
Council in the Foresters' building waa
attended by 187 persons. The affair was
under the direction of W. N. Brunt of
Evans and J. Rothenberg of Golden Gate
Council, and consisted of a choice pro
gramme, the numbers being contributed
by Mrs. Beers. Miss Juliette Turpin, F.
D. Brandon, Master Mangels, Miss K.
Butler and J. L. Cahill. There was a fine
collation and addresses by Walter N.
Brunt, Grand Councilor Savage and oth
ers, and dancing until midnight followed.
THE AMERICAN GUILD.
At the meeting of the American Guild's
local chapter, San Francisco 328, it was
announced that Supreme Deputy R. W.
McGarvle had been confined to his home
for some time by Illness. It was stated
that in a short time he would be able to
continue In the work of the guild. It was
decided that at the close of the next
meeting of the chapter there should be
after the routine business a card party
for all the members.
IMPROVED ORDER RED MEN.
C. Nellsen, an active member of the or
der, is organizing a new tribe of Red Men
who will open a wigwam In Mission
Opera Hall. There are about fifty names
on the petition to Institute, and it is ex
pected that it will be in working order by
the Ist of May.
Manzanita Tribe had an Interesting
meeting in its wigwam last Wednesday
night, when there was work in the adop
tion degree. After that had been disposed
of and other business had been passed
upon there was an adjournment to the
banquet hall, where all enjoyed a feast of
corn and venison and smoked the pipe of
peace and listened to a varied programme
of songs and stories.

â y-.vv-?Â£-_ ._â 3 l l K only player in San Francisco
to-day that may he taken seri
ously is Lillian Burkhart, and
il she. as you know, is appearing
in a vaudeville show at the
Orpheum. With comic opera and in
llammatory farce comedy at every
other hand stub is the theatrical for
tune of the town. We are under many
obligations to the Ori heum, but under
tame greater than this one. The ab
sence of any legitimate counter attrac
tion has served to attract attention to
Miss Burkhart. and attention is all that
this clever young woman needs I don't
want to pose as a discoverer and
prophet and all that sort of thing where
doubtless there have been scores of
knowing ones ahead of me, but at the
same time I should ike to go on record
as one of the pioneer appreciators of
Miss Burkhart's original and fascinat
ing art. She is sure to do something
big and brilliant one of these nights in
a bigger field, and when she does I
want to be able to chorus with the rest
of the I-told-you-sos. For you see Miss
Burkhart's case is quite different from
that of the other legitimate actresses
whom we have seen in vaudeville. They
have come Into the business through
ointment In more serious acting.
or through love of short toil and long
leisure, orâ to get down to the most
popular reasonâ through a yearning for
the queenly salary of the elevator of
the variety stage. They all have
brought with them experience, reputa
tion and a proper disesteem for the
performance of any more work than
the contract calls for. Vaudeville of
fered them no new honors, no occasion
for ambitionâ nothing, in fact, but the
maximum of salary for the minimum of
work. With .Miss Burkhart it was dif
ferent. She has to her credit just one
season of legitimate playactingâ that
was with her husband, Charles Dick
son, in "Incog." When a season or two
ago she crept into vaudeville at a salary
that even a newspaper man would
scorn, she was little better than an
amateur. She carried with her no
reputation at all and a wealth of in
experience. But she had the talent and
the grit and she knew what she wanted
to do and finally she did it, and to-day
she is the â rest actress on the va
riety stage. Maybe this mode of de
veloping genius is hardly model. The
environment of coon songs, acrobatics
and trained animals does not seem cal
culated to nourish the Instinct for
clean, graceful comedy acting. But on
the other hand there is perhaps an ad
vantage in not being hampered by the
AMUSEMENTS.

Why Miss Burkhart still sticks to
vaudeville I '.-ill not attempt to say.
Certainly she has reason to be grate
ful to it. But until the one-ad vaude
ville play reach* the same dignity that
the short story has reached In litera
ture there is no artistic reason why it
should monopolize th efforts of an
actress whose youth and skill are
needed in the larger comedies that are
already written and languishing for
proper exploitation. And in the mean
time Miss Burkhart is missing experi
ence. She has run he gamut of the
available half-hour sketch, but she has
yet to try herself In the cumulative
craftsmanship that wins in the big
play. The- actor can grow great at his
leisure, the actress must do it while
she is young. This present work is
pretty, delicately poised, full of humor.
womanliness and fragrance, but it Is
essentially miniature, and 1 think that
Miss Burkhart could do the real life
size tiling. She has the voiceâ a voice
clear, easy, beautifully musical and yet
equal to ithe quickest colloquial
phrase â the fresh, companionable stage
presence that counts for sc much; the
expressive face and the little easy fig
ure; she wears her gowns like a gen
tlewoman; and best of all, she has the
quality which is the most desirable and
the seldomest found in the woman
player, and that is Humor. Woman
may be just as humorous an animal as
man, but she has a harder time con
vincing the world. On the stage she

The principal players" meet first at a hotel
In old Point Comfort. Sites, who hails
from San Francisco, is in pursuit of a
clerk who has robbed him by forgery of
$50,000; and for whose arrest he has " of
fered a reward of $,"000. In an economi
cal effort to save the reward he has trav
eled to Virginia. To hide his Identity he
assumes the name of Mr. Wright, and the
first complication arises on his meeting
his nephew and niece, who are spending
a few weeks at the same place. He takes
them into his confidence. A far more se
rious complication arises upon the arri
val of Henrietta Oliver, who has been em
ployed by the detective agency to try to
capture the defaulter. She has learned
that la- has assumed the name of Mr.
Wright, and she Immediately picks Sites

of Henrietta; his whole manner changes.
From bAng mean and close he becomes
liberal almost to extravagance. He sends
her flowers In abundance, but she never

"Captain Swift" is not a new play to
this city, it having been produced here
several times, once at the Alcazar some
time ago. But it is a play of great popu

again. It deals with one Captain Swift,
who, after leading a life of outlawry in
Australia, returns to London to become
the guest of a Mr. Seabrook. Mrs. Sea
brook at once recognizes in him her ille
gitimate son. Swift while at the house
wins favor with Seabrook'a ward and cre

as the technical wonder of the pianistic
world. Under Mr. File ''.lander's direction
he will give two recitals in the Grand
Opera-house on Tuesday and Wednesday
afternoons at extremely popular prices.
The following is the programme for Tues
day's concert:
Sonata, F minor. Op. 37 (Beethoven): "Ro
manze," "Vogel al Prophet" (Schuman): so
nata, Op. 53. B flat (Ludwlg Schytte); "Ber
ceuse," valse. C sharp minor, valse. D flat
major (Chopin); "Scherzo,?' I! flat minor. "At
the Fountain" (Davidoff-Rosenthal); "Etude
a la Tarantella" (GruenfelJ); "Papllions" (.Ro
senthal); "Vienna Carnival," on themes by
Johann Strauss (Rosenthal).
The Ghutes.
At the Chutes Free Theater the Salvlni
family of acrobats will make their first
appearance in this country this week.
Antonio Vargas, the barytone, will sing
here for the first time, and the Hartwell
sisters, singers and dancers, will disport
themselves for the first time on any San
Francisco stage. Ada Sweeney, a
serio-comic, will be new, and Way and
Man land will present a new turn. The
remains of "Sally." embalmed, will be
gazed at in mournful contemplation by
"Joe Storms Jr." and Congo and Major
Ganta, styled the "Merry Midget," will
be seen in the zoo.
Tha Olumpia.
The Olympia has Ed Dolan, an Irish
comedian; Dollie Mitchell, a chic dancer;
Agnes Castro, the popular soprano; Quer
ita Vincent in new songs and dances, and
some ten or more other acts.
Battle of jVlanila.
This faithful and artistic reproduction
of the great sea fight is one that appeals
to all Americans. The Olympia. with Ad
miral Dewey on the bridge, is the central
figure, and but a short distance away can
be seen the burning ships of the Spanish
navy, giving silent evidence of the deadly
aim of the American gunner. The artists
who were sent to Manila have certainly
done their work in a satisfactory manner,
for the great stretch of canvas stands
the test of the strongest opera-glass and
reveals points of interest and beauty not
visible to the unaided eye.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MAJtKJBT.
NEW YORK. April 22.â The market to-day'
was almost wholly professional and the net
changes were trivial. The specialties monopo- '
1.te.l attention except for activity In some of
tho Internationals. In the early trading an ex
pected favorable bank statement was dis
counted, and on Its appearance general realiz
ing followed, the appearance of a large supply
of stock from large holders giving encourage
ment to the bears to put out short lines, and
the market closed with a raid In progress. The
bank statement showed a large increase In
loans and deposits and consequent heavy gain
in surplus reserve. Loudon sold freely of
Southern preferred and Denver and Rio Grande,
but those stocks were very well taken and all
cioseo. at good advances. Norfolk and Western
â hares were the only other strong slocks.
Sugar was strong throughout and gained 2%.
Brooklyn Transit moved Irregularly, slightly
above yesterday's figures. Among other special
ties Continental Tobacco was pressed for sale
early on the Increased capitalization, but ral
lied on supporting orders, and closed with a
gain of 2 points. Tennessee Coal and Iron was
weak, losing a point. New Jersey Central was
helped by the announcement that certain high
rate bonds would be refunded by the Issu
ance of stock to be subscribed for by present
stockholders. The market closed weak.
The level of prices for the week was not
much changed, declines only lightly exceeding
In number the advances. The trading was of
c. professional character. The trade reports for
the wei showed a marked abatement of pros
perity in various lines of industrial activity.
The imports for March were the largest for
nearly two years, nevertheless the excess of
exports reached nearly J33,OWJ,<iOO, largely due
to a gain in manufactured ducts, at; the ex
ports of cereals, cattle and raw material fell
off about 118,000,000. Sterling exchange was
strong, with an insufficiency of commercial
hills. it was thought that preparations for the
payment of the Spanish Indemnity figured In
the starting market.
Money on 'Â11 phc-wed a variable tendency,
alternately easy and firm, with ease generally
prevailing. The bank clearings of the United
States, reflecting the comparative apathy in
speculation, decreased for the week over $94.-
OuO.oOO. but were still greatly in excess of those
of last year. The grain market's strength, sup
posedly reflecting an expectation of a shrink
age in the cereal yield, waa watched narrowly
for its effect on the Grangers. This group of
Btocks moved within compressed limits, while
Turlington advanced about 2 points on the sub
scription privilege extended to stockholders.
'I "he professional element showed a frequent
disposition to be bearish, while real holders of
Â«tock generally clung tenaciously to their fa
â¢voritea, but tho liquidation of speculative
holders was not lacking. The dullness of the
week Merced conducive to an Increase In the '
short interests, which acted as a support to
values on concessions frequently. After a long
period of inactivity business suddenly in
creased as though it had been prearranged.
The most notable changes in prices for the
Week were declines In Third Avenue 9%, Brook
lyn Transit 4, Manhattan 3%. People's Gas 3%,
New York Central 2 and Lackawanna and
"Western % each. The advances Included New
York Airbrake 11, Colorado Fuel 10%, Colorado
Fuel preferred an dNew Haven 7 each. Ana
conda Mining 8, National Steel 4, New Jersey
Central, Delaware and Hudson and Louisville
over 3 each and Southern preferred 2%.
There was talk at one time of a recurrence
of discrimination in loans against the Indus
trials, but less was heard of this with the eas
ing of money.
There were sales for Western account on sev
eral occasions, which was taken to be con
nected with Information on crop prospects.
Railway earnings that appeared during the
week were generally favorable.
Considerable favorable comment was aroused
;Jjy the keen Investment inquiry for bonds,
which Included middle class as well as prime
grades. The market displayed pronounced
strength throughout, moving Independently of
the stock market.
United States twos, threes registered and

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.
NEW YORK, April 22.â Financier says.
The New York banks added $3,684,700 to their
cash holdings last week, making a gain of
about .6,600,000 since April 8. Within the same
period reserve requirements, owing to tho
shrinkage of 810,565.700 in deposits, decreased
about $2,050,000, so that the excess reserve has
expanded $15,000,000 in the comparatively short
space mentioned. This change, which, of
course, tends to an easier condition of the
money market, has been brought about in part
through the resumption of the interior move
ment ln this direction and by the liquidation j
in loans, which has been a choice feature of j
the statements for several weeks past. The I
loan Item discloses the fact that since the
opening of April a contraction of between 819.- |
000,000 and 120,001/, has taken place. Ob- i
viously, In the face of a showing like this, !
the outlook as regards money rates becomes
very much more settled, and as the factors ;
which make for an expansion ln reserves are
â till prominent the future holds out the prom- i
ise of still easier conditions. The current state- I
ment, however, when studied in detail, presents )
some anomalous features. Thus, one Institu
tion, which has strong foreign connections, has
decreased Its loans no less than $9,000,000, and
Its deposits and specie accounts show corre
sponding changes. This may have occurred :
in the usual course of business, but the sterling !
loans made in this center a fortnight since j
and the lmmlneney of the settlement of the j
Philippine indemnity may not have been with- '
out influence.
The financing of industrial combinations and
the settlement of heavy railroad deals an* re- j
sponsible for some of the unlooked for changes l
In the individual Institutions from week to
week, but as these are now generally provided
for. tho___ weekly exhibit of totals may be more '
easy ntemplatlon. Taking the statement
ln a broad sense, lt means- that if anything l
the banks are recuperating the losses sustained
during the crop movement early In the spring,
and since they have concluded the operations
Incident to the financing of various large deals
that from this time on they will have loanable
funds in excess of the demand. This may tend
to revive sagging speculation, or it may in
spire a resumption of truet formation checked
several weeks since, but the latter is Improb
able, owing both to exhaustion of suitable ma
terial and the indisposition to encourage the
trust babit. As for speculation there are too
many conflicting features, from foreign money
markets to domestic crops and other causes, to
make a prediction of much value.
THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 22.â Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were generally quiet and

icaâ should have ever been able to
get Into the castle, for before this day no man had ever escaped from
the deadly sleep of the Poppies of the Land of Silence. Al Araaf
guessed rightly that but for Prince I-Don't-Care the giants would
never have been able to cross the fields where the popples were
growing.
"There is your enemy, Abraminidin, said the magician in a loud
voice, pointing to Prince [-Don't-Care.
The two giants stared at Price I-Don't-Care and then laughed
heartily, because the Prince now looked so small to them that they
were amused at the idea that they ought to fear him.
This made Prince I-Dori't-Care angry, for he did not like to be
laughed at. "Come on; both of you at a time," he said fiercely to the
two giants, holding his sword as if he would attack them.
Ha, ha, ha! Ha. ha, ha!" laughed Abraminidin.
"Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho!" responded Hardflst.
"Such a funny little man," said Abraminidin, "and to think that
I went away to get out of his way!"
"Funniest thing I ever heard of," said Hardflst, when he had
so far stopped laughing that he was able to talk.
"Cowards!" shouted Prince I-Don't-Care. "If you will not fight,
I will first fight this wicked old man."
Before either of the giants could stop him Prince I-Don't-Care,
with one swift stroke, cut off the head of Al Araaf, and the magician
fell dead upon the floor. At that all the mice servants and courtiers
scampered off as fast as they could go.
. "Hasten." they said to the lions and the tigers and the wolves
r~ md to all other wild beasts of the fields and of the jungles, "the ma
gician. Al Araaf, is dead, and the Prince I-Don't-Care, who is might
ier, will be here goon. Flee!"
Hut the wild beasts had better sense than the timid mice.
"It is good news that you bring us," said they. "We will be bet
ter off now that there is no magician to turn us into other forms
that he may force us to be his servants. Ho, brother mice, wait and
you will see that a better time has come for us."
There was such a noise just then within the castle that the mice
which, like all other mice, had much curiosityâ stopped to listen.
Swords were .ashing against swords, and as the animals looked up at
the castle windows to find out what it all meant they saw the two
giants running about and slashing wildly with their swords at little
Prince I-Don't-Care. Then the doors were slammed together with a
loud noise. Then ail was still.
"The giants have killed the Prince." said the watching mice to
the other animals. So they all thought; but, as they watched, the
little man, taking a desperate chance for his life, leaped boldly out
of an open window at the very top of the castle. The ugly heads of
the two giants were poked out of the same window to watch the
Prince, who had managed to give the giants a fine, lesson in this way.
Hardly had the head of the magician rolled upon the castle floor
before the two giants were trying to make a prisoner of the Prince.
Strong as they were, the giants were not as quick as Prince I-Don't-
Care. This the Prince saw after he had dodged the swords of the

JUST about half of our puzzle
solvers last week guessed that
puzzle No. 1, in the mountain
series, was "glass mountain."
About one large baker's dozen
were sure that it was "Lookout Moun
tain." But there were enough to guess
even the hard No. 1 and all the others
to make up quite a long roll of honor,
which is published this morning, that
the bright ones may have due credit
The r|urT)ble Little Violet and the Haughty Lilac.
I AM more beautiful than you," said
the Lilac to the Rose In the front
yard.
"Perhaps you are," said the Rose.
"I know I am," said the Lilac.
"I think that shy little Violet is pret
tier than you," said the Rose.
V "Humph, she's too shy to say yea or
i." said the Lilac.
â¢ "I don't think so." said the Rose.
"Oh, she's crying!" said the Lilac in
surprise.
"Poor little thing," said the Rose, as
she leaned over and kissed the Violet.
OW the time had come to show
whether the magician, Al Ar
aaf, hr\d guessed the secret of
that dream in which he had
found that he was to cause the
death of the giants and that he
was to rule in the land forever,
holding it as his own. You
know that the magician, when
he caused the poppies to grow.
thought that thereby he would
keep Abraminidin, the giant,
who was the rightful owner of
the castle of Al Kabo, from
coming back to his home. But
his plan had failed in this, for
after the sword of light had
swept a path clear of the pop
pies, so that Prince I-Don't-
Care and Bloodfillikin were
able to make their way safely
to the castle, Abraminidin and
his brother, the giant Hardfist,
had no trouble in passing over
the same path and here they
were. Al Araaf was surprised
when he saw the giants, but he
wondered more that the Prince

lint nearer drawn the giant shrinks
To subtle form of crafty minks
and encouragement. There are some
pretty hard puzzles this morning, all
about California towns and cities. See
how many you can guess. The correct
answers to the puzzles published last
Sunday are as follows: Twin Peaks
(peeks), Howell (Napa County), Hamil
ton, Whitney. Coast Range, Siskiyou
(Siss-key-ewe). Here are some of the
names of some of our young friends
who sent In lists of answers which
"I should think you would be ashamed
of yourself, Rose," said the vain Lilac.
"Why?" said the Rose. Â .' i\
"Becauseâ" The Lilac got no fur
ther.
Just then a little boy and girl came
skipping along. They stopped before
the Rose and said: "What a lovely
rose!" and going over to the Violet said,
"What a beautiful violet!" and without
taking any notice of the Lilac went
away. The Lilac's pride was so hurt
she only lived a few hours and then
died.
GEORGE W. SIMONTON, Vallejo. ;
THE SAN FKAN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APKIL 23, 1899.
giants narrowly half a dozen times. A bold plan came to him, which
was to run in between the two giants when they were swinging
their swords, and take the risk of being cut In two by them, the
Prince thinking that the chance was better for the giants to cut one
another than for them to touch him, their bodies being so much
larger targets for the sword play.
This bold plan worked very well once. As he went in between
the two giants both struck at him with great force. Their great
swords met in air and clashed, making the noise that had been heard
by the listening and watching animals. Both swords were raised
and fell several times. Prince I-Don't-Care played his dangerous
game with the greatest coolness and lack of fear. Down fell the
swords yielded by the giants for the tenth time. So far the Prince
had escaped all harm, and the giants were crazed with rage, so that
they forgot to be careful with their swords.
"Oh. oh!" shouted Abraminidin, "be more careful, Hardflst."
Hardfist's sword had struck him and cut his left hand off.
"Be careful yourself!" shouted Hardflst in response/ "See what
you have done." No wonder he spoke â Abraminidin's sword had
slashed into the right hand of Hardflst.
At this rate it was plain that the giants would kill each other,
and so save Prince I-Don't-Care the trouble.
"Run and slam the doors!" shouted Hardflst.
Abraminidin did as he was told. Then It was that there was a
moment of silence, for the Prince hid under the giants' huge bed.
Then Prince I-Don't-Care leaped from the open window at the top
of the lofty castle and spun dizzily through the air toward the dis
tant ground.
Think of leaping from the window of a castle that was higher
from the ground than any church spire in the world! Think of being
whirled over and over a hundred times in air, like a pin-wheel,
while falling down to almost sure death upon the stone floor of the
castle court-yard.
"Forward!" said the Lion, the King of the Beasts.
Like a flash of light the wild beasts leaped to be the first to
seize Prince I-Don't-Care for their prey. Now they are crowded to
gether, pushing, growling, snarling. Now â one breathless second
moreâ Prince I-Don't-Care, falling to almost sure death, is saved
by striking upon the thick, soft and furry coat of the lion. Not an
Instant did the Prince lose. He had not been saved from death by
falling to be eaten by wild beasts if he could help it.
About the lion and the Prince rage the beasts. The Prince throws
his arms around the lion's neck and goads the lion's sides fiercely with
his spurs. They are off with the speed of the wind, the Prince riding
the lion and goading him on. The other beasts are following closely.
"He is mine!" growls the bear.
"Mine, too!" grumbles the tiger.
"Mine only!" answers the lion, as he runs swiftly.
There is a dark cave into which the lion goes. All the wild beasts
also go In. The lion will not dine on the Prince, for the King of
Beasts is not the equal of the beasts altogether, and they are all
hungry.
"Well, growls the lion, sitting on his haunches and glaring at
the other beasts in the darkness, "let the Prince decide which of us
shall have the honor of eating him."
"Why, as to that," answered the Prince, "why â don't care."
Thereupon, finding that they must settle the matter for them
selves, the beasts fell to fighting. Every one got In the way of every

And now upon the raging main
A rakish, long, black craft is seen.

The nature of the ship to spy.
"It Is a pirate ship." quoth he.
"Come, comrades, up, arid put to sea!
No more she'll ply her murderous trade,
For she our prize shall soon be made."
Then he a signal whistle blew
And summoned Towser for his crew-
And though all sails the pirates spread
And fast. before the wind they fled,
The bold pursuers' rain of lead
Soon laid the crew of pirates dead.
And yet, with treasures well supplied,

Sunday's Call. I always like to look at
The Call and think It terrible if I do not
have time to look at it every morning be
fore I go to school. I like the Children's
page the best of all and think it lots of
fun to guess the puzzles. My yellow
mamma kitty has four yellow baby kit
ties and 1 wish all the boys and girls
could see them. I send you the answers
to the puzzles and hope they are right. I
am 9 years old and go to the Agasslz
School. Your little friend,
IRENE CYRUS. .
San Francisco, April 16.
Dear Editor: Our parents take The Call
and we enjoy reading the children's pagb
very much. We have never seen any let
ters from Black Diamond, so we thought
we would write and let you know what
our town Is like. We have a large sal
mon cannery and two wharves, where the
Stockton and Sacramento boats land. f Wo
are both In the eighth grade, and our
teacher's name is Miss Ella Cunningham
Stiles. Our pastor's name is Rev. Fred
erick H. Whales. We send the answer to
the puzzles. Hoping we will soon see this
In The Call, we are respectfully, *

other. Prince I-Don't-Care laughed gleefully. He was fond of dan
ger, and liked to have unusual adventures. His sword was once
more in his stout right hand. While -the lion and the tiger were
fighting a bear blocked the door of the cave to keep the Prince in
the cave. "For," thought the bear, "I am strong enough to conquer
any animal except the lion and the tiger, and the Prince will be mine
when the big animals kill each other. The lion and the tiger fought
on. "Come," said the Prince to the bear, "let us see who shall tend
the door."
"Agreed," answered the bear.
The lion and the tiger were too busy to notice the bear. The other
smaller animals were afraid to take part as against the bear. The
truth was that the bear thought that he would have no trouble to
conquer the Prince.
It was now the sword of the Prince against the claws and the
teeth of the bear. The Prince made one mistake, and the bear struck
his sword and threw It outside of the cave, through the doorway. The
boar was full of joy; he would also have been full of the Prince but
for the sword of light, which was suddenly waved above the bear's
head. Blindness fell upon all the beasts for an instant. The Prince*
was quick to see his chance to escape. Quick! He is out through
the doorway. He has dug the dirt out from under a great, rolling
stone with the point of his sword. The stone rolls up against the door
of the cave and the beasts are all prisoners. They cannot move the
"Now," said Prince I-Don't-Care, while yet the howls of the
beasts In' the cave rung out In a horrible chorus, "I must attend to
the two giants. I have had very good luck twice to-day, having been
saved when I fell and the beasts did not eat meâ what next?
Well. I don't care."

TOM, KATIE
AND ROSiE.
GIRLS are no good," said Jack
to his cousin Tom. "they always
cry if one has any fun. "Silly,
soft things; that's what they
are," said Tom, "and so stuck
up. too!"
"Let's play at being girls,"
"That wouldn't be any fun," answer-
Ed Jack scornfully. "Why, girls can't
play marbles." ,". > '"": "*' "
"Do you hear those silly boys?"
asked Kate of Rosie. "Just because
we don't like to be rough, they think
we are silly. Well/ never mind; we
don't want them. Shall we go Into the
meadow, where the hay has been car
ried, and each make a garden? I
would plant roses in mine.".
"I must get my roses out of my
mother's rosebeds," said Kate. "I
should like to see them all red."
When the two -iants had seen Prince I-Don't-Care carried oft
by the lion, with all the wild beasts folio' ing, they thought that
they had known the last of their enemy, and so they fixed up their
hurts the best they know how, and went up in one of the towers of
the castle to look out. They saw after a time a very large dog wait
ing outside of the gate, and beside the large dog was a very small
one. \
"A very fine dog." said Abraminidin.
"It would make a good watch-dog," answered Hardfist. "I will
call him in."
Even as they spoke the large dog came in and lay down under
a tree, and the smaller dog also entered the court-yard and lay be
side the large dog.
The two giants went to see the animals. They were much pleased,
and led them to a kennel and then fastened the outer gate of the
Or\ fill f*
"We are here again, Bloodfillikin," said a voice in the smaller
dog's skin, when the giants had gone away.
"Yes," answered Bloodfillikin, "it was lucky that you killed that
wolf on the way from the cave. The two giants think that you are
a dog now that you are in the wolf's hide, my dear Prince."
Now when it was night the two giants shut all the dors of the
castle and bolted them, shutting the Prince and Bloodfillikin out.
They also had shut out the mouse servants and courtiers of Al
Araaf, who were now without a master. While the giants snored
and the prince and Bloodfilikin were trying to find out a way to get
into the castle, a mouse, dressed in a robe of red, came to the Prince
to offer to do him a service. He said that he and his companions
could open the doors of the castle by drawing back the bolts with
their teeth. What would the Prince give them in return?
"There is a mill in the Valley of Oko," said the Prince, "that is
full from foundation to eaves with sacks of the finest grain that ever
has been seen. That mill belongs to the castle of Gorbozo, and the
castle is mine. If you will open the castle doors now you shall have
the mill for your own and the miller shall always grind the finest
corn meal and the finest flour for you; and the miller's pretty daugh
ter shall never try to kill you with her ready broom, but shall be your
friend forever; and every Christmas day you shall feast with me
sitting at my table as honored guests and having whole cheeses to
eat and everything that is nice, and I will marry the miller's pretty
daughter, and she will make nice plum pudding for you."
At this the mouse laughed. "How do you know that the miller's
pretty daughter will marry you?"
Anyway, the bargain was made between the mouse and Prince
I-Don't-Care. Then the mice went inside of the castle, creeping
into the great hallway through a hole they had gnawed through the
floor. They pulled back all the bolts of the doors without making
a noise. The doors were opened then by Prince I-Don't-Care from
the outside. Enter then the Prince, sword in hand; also enter Blood
fillikin, while still the two giants were sleeping.
D. H. W.
(To be continued.)
The boys had stopped talking about
marbles and were walking behind the
girls quietly. Suddenly Jack said: "I
shall plant mine full of red poppies."
"You go and play by yourselves."
said Kate quite angrily; "you said that
girls are no good."
"More they are, only to make be
lieve," said Jack. "Fancy pretending
to have a garden and planting, other
people's flowers in it. Just like girls."
"Children, children, don't quarrel;"
their mother called out from a window. .
"Come home and see little Nell, who is
sick, and has nothing to play with ex
cept an old doll."
So the gardens did not get planted
that day after all.

HARRY WAS
IN TROUBLE,
ONE day Harry came running into
the house, crying as hard as he
could. Mrs. West ran to see
what was the matter. She saw
at once that his face and hands
were very muddy. This is the story
that Harry told:
"Mamma, I was going to feed the
pigs. I could not reach over the gate,
and so I opened it. The pigs ran out,
and now they are eating your cabbages.
Will you help me to put them in their
pens?"
Harry's mamma readily agreed. They
went in search of the pigs as soon as
Harry had been washed. They found
them in the garden eating cabbages.
Then Harry said that he was sorry, and
that he would never leave the gate
open again, and he has kept his prom

strongly marked.

MISS SUSAN P.. Petalumaâ This is the
hand of a delicate, nervous, fretful per
son. You are bright and observant. Your
lines indicate thrift and economy. You
will be disappointed in one love affair,
i but eventually will secure your ideal. The
death of your father will Interfere with
j your plans for a time.
T. M. L., Reno You are not firm enough.
You allow people to influence you to your
detriment. You will inherit a small sum
â  of money from a relative this year.
GRACE A.. San Joseâ Your hand shows
pride and ambition. Cool, self-possessed.
Unapproachable to many. You are ruled
solely by your own opinions. Possess
good principles, but are not generous.
Two marriages. One marriage will cause
great unhappiness.
Y. Z., Sacramentoâ affability and
: generosity. You are sweet-tempered;
sensible and highly esteemed. Two love
affairs. Good health generally. You have
a strong will, and should be successful in

j lack of decision has caused you iolrse
otherwise good opportunities.
MAY W., Vallejoâ You evidently- are
destined by nature to live a long life. Will
! not, however, bo one of unbroken success.
! You are careless and lack pride. Some

by the junior class, Intermediate work by
the intermediate class, parallel bars and
an exhibition of first aid to the injured

ture and a trophy will be the reward of
the victorious nine.
THE TRAP SHOOTERS.
Bekeart and McMurchy Enjoying
Themselves in Mendocino County.
The gun clubs will put in an appearance
Sunday at their respective trap shoot
ing grounds. The San Francisco Gun Club
will hold a live-bird shoot near San
Clemente station; the Union Gun Club
will hold a bluerock shoot on the Lincoln
Club grounds, Alameda, and the Olympic
Gun Club will try conclusions on blue
rocks at Ingleside. On Sunday, April 30,
the San Francisco Gun Club will have
several pool-shooting contests at Ala
meda Point.
Sportsmen will be pleased to learn that
Harvey McMurchy and Phil Bekeart are
enjoying happy moments catching trout
and fresh air on the banks of Big River,
in Mendocino County. It is said that
Bekeart with his little pistol winged a
flying fish in the Big River lagoon. Dr.
E. N. Short has written a friend in this
city a long description of his trip to the
mountains. His letter winds up as fol
lows: "No use In argument, this fellow
Bekeart Is a wonderful shot. He has been
reading the yellow journal, and you know
that Phil delights in perusing anything
that is sensational or imaginary. A few
evenings ago he pointed out to me a great
story concerning some wonderful perform
ance of a dime novel hero who bagged a
thousand swallows in tin afternoon's
shooting with a parlor rifle. Don't you
know that since Phil read the article he
has wasted all the ammunition in camp
shooting at trout which can be seen leap
ing out of the water after winged insects?
He has actually killed a few 'Dolly Var
dens' with his little gun, and now
contends that this style of shooting Is the
kind of practice a man requires who has
predilection for trap shooting. 'I am sat
isfied now,' said Phil, 'that on my return
to the city I will astonish Haight, Feud
ner, Golcher and other crackajack trap
shooters when I meet them at the Ingle
side trap shooting grounds. I think I can
easily grass one hundred straight. Oh, this
shooting at jumping trout Is the greatest
scheme on earth to sharpen a man's wits
and make him as quick as a steel trap.' "

IN BARGE AND SKIFF. j
Ariels Will Hold the First Rowing
Regatta of the Season.
The convention of oarsmen held In Jus
tice of the Peace J. E. Barry's courtroom
last Tuesday night, though It was, attend
ed by representatives from all the clubs
except the Olympic and Pioneer, did not
reach any conclusion. The arguments for
leaving the Pacific Association and form
ing a Pacific or "Western Rowing Associa
tion, to be affiliated with the National
Association of Amateur Oarsmen,, were
set forth by S. J. Pembroke and J. D.
Mahoney, and those on the other side by
the delegates from the Ariel and Dolphin
clubs. The failure of the P. A. A. to hold
regattas over measured courses and to
keep records of the performances of oars
men was pointed out, and it was stated
that it is not 'to the oarsmen's interests
to belong to an association the parent
body of which expressly disclaims arv
Jurisdiction over rowing and regatta's. If
a rowing association were formed -its
board of managers would not have to ex
pend energy on track and field events and
on other m? Iters with which oarsmen
have no concern. Money contributed by
the oarsmen would be expended on row
ing, and half of it would not be sent out
of the State to support a non-rowing
Eastern organization, as at present.
Every oarsman who has rowed in re
gattas has paid $1 per annum for regis
tration and each rowing club $17 50 in the
lost two years to the Amateur Athletic
Union, oarsmen having been told that un
less they did so they would not be per
mitted to row.
The advocates of continuing . in the
present condition simply urge that though
the P. A. A. has done nothing for rowing
it would have done so had it been necea
sary, and that the rowing men have held
several successful regattas under the aus
pices of the P. A. A. and have had fewer
disagreements than ever before; also that
the .oarsmen were registered not merely
as oarsmen but as amateur athletes and
were entitled to take part ln swimming
races, track and field events and other
sports.
The Ariels will hold a regatta at Bong
Bridge on Sunday, April 29, at which there
will be senior and junior barge races, a
skiff race for novices and an exhibition
shell race between "W. Growney and Le
ander Stevenson. ':'â¢';"â

St. Dominic's Picnic.
The enthusiasm already manifested by
those who have in charge the picnic to be
given by .the members of St. Dominic's
Church on May 6 bodes well for Its suc
cess. A meeting of the parishioners was
held on Monday' evening last, and tha
various committees in charge of the af
fair gave promising reports. The picnic
will be given in Mirabel Park. A variety
of games has been arranged and will be
a feature of the day's outing. An ex
cellent band will discourse music for the
dancing, and with G. M. Kelly as floor
manager an enjoyable time will be surely
had by those who attend.
