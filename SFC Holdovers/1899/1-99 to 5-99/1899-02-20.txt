MANILA, Feb. 20, 10 a. m.â
The insurgents were evidently
encouraged by the withdrawal
of troops from Guadaloupe last
night. They followed the
Americans at a safe distance
as they retiied to San Pedro
Macate, and during the night
kept up a desultory but annoy
ing fire. Several Of their shots
penetrated the headquarters of
General King, which is the
bui.lding formerly occupied by
Ihe rebel General Pilax.
An unusual number of the
.enemy who have been seen to
the northward causes a suspi

attack on General McArthur*a

T'F.TROIT, Mich., Feb. 19.â Admiral Charles Beresford was seen In pass
ing through Detroit to-night in reference to the battle reported at Talien
Wan between Russians and Chinese. Lord Beresford paid that such a bat
tle was only what he had been expecting for some time. Its effects, he be
lieved, would be to shake the Chinese Government more than anything that
has occurred, and he asserted that trade would also suffer as a result of it.
As to the statement that the origin of the trouble concerned a question of
taxes, his Lordship said he did not understand how that could be the case,
unless the Russians had very recently begun taxing the Chinese. He thought
it more likely that the Russians may have taken Chinese land for military
purposes and not paid what the natives considered full value for it.
As the Chinese never differentiate between foreigners, considering all
alike. Lord Charles said this incident will work as much harm to British
and American interests as to Russia.

"that I consider it extremely improbable that, no matter what may be the
final disposition of Â«'hina, Russia will never be driven out."

effect of the lire was apparently to
drive the rebels further inland.
Beyond a few ineffectual volleys
from the trenches, which were returned
with interest, the enemy made no dem

rest of the line. Scouts claim to have
seen General Pio del Pilar, who com
manded the rebels at Paco, with his
arm in a sling, directing the troops.

RIOTOUS SCENES IN
THE STREETS OF PARIS
Conflicts Between Rival Factions in
Which People Are Injured and
Many Arrests Made.
PARIS, Feb. 19.â Police measures for
the maintenance of order have been
taken on an extensive scale and the
! city is quiet. M. Loubet did not auit
j his residence at the Luxembourg until
6 o'clock this evening.
Toward 7 o'clock demonstrations oc- I
curred In front of the office of an an- |
archistic paper, the Journal dv Peuple. |
on the Boulevard Montemartre. for and
against Loubet. t
There was a collision between the
rival factions and several person* were
Injured. The partisans of the newly
elected President were worsted In the
conflict and moved off to the Cafe Bre
bant, where they were again attacked
j and dispersed by their opponents.
Many arrests were made.
Similar encounters occurred at about
9 o'clock at the offices of the Libre
Parole.
In the course of the demonstrations,
the Dreyfusards attempted to invade
the offices of the Petite Journal. Find
ing the doors barred against them,
they smashed the windows.
At the hall of the Thousand Columns
700 Bonapartists met to protest against
the election of M. Loubet. Speeches
were made by Baron Le Goux. M. j
Lasies and M. Cuneo d'Orlando. Sev- j
eral persons who interrupted the pro- j
ceedings were ejected. When the meet- i
ing broke up there were some slieht
disorders and several arrests were
made.
More serious disorders occurred at
the Brasserie Maxeville, on the Boule
vard Montmartre, where several
women were trampled upon and in
jured.
A fracas also took place at the Cafe
de Spanoramas, where blows were free
ly exchanged. In both cases the police
intervened energetically, arresting j
many.
At 11 o'clock an enormous crowd was
demonstrating in favor of M. Zola.
Toward midnight crowds broke the
windows of the Rothschilds offices, in
the Hup Lafltte, and another group
wrecked the offices of the anti-Juif.
Minor disturbances took place in
various parts of the city, but the
crowds gradually dispersed and at mid
night quietude . had been almost re
stored.
To-morrow Premier Dupuy will ask
the Chamber of Deputies to vote 6400
francs for the obsequies of M. Faure.
This was the amount voted for Presi
dent Carnot's funeral. President Lou
bet, following the precedent set by j
President Casimir-Perier, will attend
the obsequies.
M. Loubet will preside at the first
Cabinet Council of the new administra
tion on Tuesday. It is estimated that
20,000 persons viewed M. Faure's body
on Saturday.
On the advice of medical attendants
the remains of M. Faure were placed
â  In the coflin this morning, in the pres
| ence of M. Dupuy. This afternoon
crowds filed past the bier. Mme. Faure

which is more guarded, will wait to
see him actually at work. The Liberte
exhorts him to relieve the impression
that he was elected in the interests of
Dreyfus.
The family of the dead President
spent some time in the presence of. the
body to-day, prior to the touching cere
mony of placing the remains in_the
coffln^which took place at noon. M.
Dupuy stood at the foot of the cata
falque, while the deceased'B military
household marched in and took uo a
position behind the Premier. MM.
Berge, Legall and Blondet were also
present. With tears in his eyes. M.
Berge cut a few locks of hair from M.
Faure's head and kissed his left hand,
an example which was followed by M.
Legall and M. Blondet. The body was
then raised and placed within the cof
fin, which was enclosed in a leaden
shell, the cover of which was soldered
down, leaving a glass covered aperture
through which the face of the dead
President is visible. Upon the silver
plate on the casket is a simple inscrip
tion. After these ceremonies were com
pleted, the casket was replaced upon
the catafalque and the public was
again admitted to view the remains.
CAMPAIGN AGAINST
PRESIDENT LOUBERT
PARIS, Feb. 19.â Altogether 100 ar
rests have been made in connection
with to-day's' disturbances.
There is every sign of a campaign
against President Loubet, similar to
that which drove M. Casimir-Per.er to
resign. Clearly. La Patrie Francaise
will leave no stone unturned to achieve
this object, its chief ground of objection
being that the President is a Dreyfus
i ard. The street demonstrations which
have occurred have not been spontane
ous, but were evidently organized and
so far they have been easily suppressed.
It is affirmed that the Dupuy Cabinet
will aot energetically to maintain public
order.
The keynote of M. Loubet's policy
may probably be found in the following
conversation with M. Bourgeoise, leader
of the moderate radicals, who came to
offer to the new President the support
of his party. Before accepting It, M.
Loubet said:
"You are doubtless aware that one of
the first enactments of any Ministry of
mine will Lj a stringent law to stem
the current of insult, infamy and defa
mation which now befouls France. I
fear that perhaps legislation of this
kind will scarcely tally with the radical
ideas."
M. Bourgeoises answer was a cheer
ful acquiescence.
Herr Frisehauer, the correspondent
here of the Neve Freie Presse, has been

DUKE OF ORLEANS
LEAVES FO^ MILAN
LONDON, Feb. 20.â According to the
Rome correspondent of the Daily Tele
graph, the Due d'Orleans, realizing the
impossibility of anything favorable to
him happening In France, has left
Turin for Milan.
The Paris correspondent of the
Times says that no ground can be dis
covered for describing President Lou
bet as a Dreyfusard, adding: "It would
seem if he were that he would have
accepted the resignation of the Dupuy
Cabinet."
ONLY A FORE'ASTE
OF WHAT IS COMING
LONDON, Feb. 20.â The Paris cor
respondent of the Daily Mail describes
the scenes at the Versailles election as
a "Donnybrook fair with a touch of
tragedy thereinâ the tragedy of a new
ly chosen ruler attempting to ienore his
unpopularity and smilingly returning
thanks for congratulations."
"I believe," says the correspondent,
"that the riotous scenes in Paris are
only a foretaste of what is coming-.
Last night the boulevards were, battle
fields and nowhere was a voice to glor
ify the new President. To-day the
press is uncommonly rancorous. Here
are some of the titles of honor con
ferred upon Loubet: 'Imbecile.' 'Pan
amaiPt,' 'wretch,' 'liar,' perjurer,' and
avowed protector of the Dreyfusards.' "

HANNA REFUSED
TO AID BURNS
IN HIS FIGHT
Still Another Boast of the
Mine-Jumper Without a
Shadow of Truth.
Mclaughlin betrays a secret
The Claim That the National Adminis
tration Was Behind Dan Proven
False by a Telegram From
the Ohio Senator.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb.
19. â It was a transparent claim always, but flimsy a fraud
as it was, the Burns gang can no longer say they have the
backing of the National administration. It was Major Mc
laughlin who let the cat out of the bag. In his efforts to
win over one of the Bulla men, he told more than he ought
to have told, and he told it louder than a shrewd manager
should tell his secrets, so the veil has dropped and another
flimsy pretext of the eminent leaders of the Burns faction
has gone a-glimmering.
The feline was released during a conversation held last
Friday between Major McLaughlin and Assemblyman Me
lick. Poor old Simpson had just decided to sail under the
black flag in the Senatorial fleet, and had sealed his politi
cal doom by voting for Burns. Flushed with victory, Mc-
Laughlin had decided to win Melick over also, and he told
the Assemblyman so.
Now Melick does not drink more than is good for him
and he can see as far through the political grindstone as an
other, so when McLaughlin told him he should listen to
the wishes of his party and vote for Burns. Melick vigor
ously denied that the party had spoken. Mr. Melick was
seen to-night and thus detailed the conversation that fol
lowed:
"The major said to me: 'You know who the party
wants.'
"I replied that I thought I did, seeing that I voted once
a day.
" 'You should vote as the party wishes,' said the major.
'The organization should have some say in the matter.'
"I told him the organization had never spoken. To this
he replied that" he had tried to get the State Central Com
mittee together to declare for Dan Burns and had tele
graphed to United States Senator Mark Hanna for permis
sion to do so, but Hanna wouldn't give his consent. The
major then produced a telegram from Hanna, which in ef
fect was that it was against all party usage to call a State
Central Committee together for any such purpose as declar
ing for any particular Senatorial candidate. He hoped the
long deadlock would not injure the party in California, but
he could not sanction any such course as the major had
mapped out."
That was the end of the conversation and Melick and
the friends who were with him and who saw and heard it all,
left McLaughlin sorrowing over the refusal to allow him to
play his great card.
So falls all the talk about the organization. It was never
intended that the party should be consulted, but it was
hoped the Central Committee could be braced up sufficient
ly to enable it to declare in favor of Burns. Now that the
scheme has been exploded, the touts must search for an
other fairy tale to whisper in the ears of confiding legisla
tors.
It is significant that Burns and his lieutenants have been
unable to draw the National administration into the fight.
Hanna is not a man to foregather with a crowd of losers; to
espouse the cause of a man whose victory would be a curse
and his defeat a blessing. The Burns people have known all
along they could not get the support of anybody but the
touts and heelers, the Jilsons and Wrights, and the irre
sponsibles like Simpson, but they kept up the gaudy pre
tense and tried to ladle it out as pap to support the weak
kneed.

it" from start to Jinish Grant's friends be
. ing largely in pie majority. Adjournment
was had after two hours' stormy debate
without action being taken. A motion de
nouncing: Grant was overwhelmingly vot
ed down."
The men of California who have been
making such an earnest and gallant
fight since the Legislature convened to
save the State from the disgrace of
Burns' election to the United States
Senate, are greatly encouraged to
night. They were convinced early in
the struggle that Burns would be beat
en out of sight if the people were once
arouped to the danger confronting the
commonwealth. The mass-meetings
held in Southern California and the
events in Ventura County have had a
good effect in arousing public senti
ment. It is susrsest'-'d to-night that
measures be taken in every county of
the State to instruct all Republican
â  members to remain here at their re
spective posts of duty until the final
adjournment of the legislature.
Burns will attempt to do. business
with the weak and pliable as soon as
the pay of members stops. It is the
calculation of the touts that the re-
Bpectable business men. and men of af
fairs whose presence are required at
home, will b<-> compelled to leave Sacra
mento shortly aft^r the first of March.
The Burns touts who live on politics,
and ex.*ct to be rewarded if Dan wins
out, can stay here. They have no busi
ness or professional interests at home
to look after, hence it makes no differ
ence to them whether they remain here
or swarm around the Palace and Grand
-hotels in San Francisco. Steps may be
taken in every county represented by
an anti-Burns legislator to keep its
representatives here to defeat the obvi
ous scheme of the touts.
While nine-tenths of the Republican
voters of the State are opposed to Dan
Burns' candidacy for the United States
Esnate, the party organization refuses
to consider their wishes. To save tne
party from disruption the Republican
voters may be compelled to make their
wishes known "to the Legislature
through other channels than the party
organization.
The touts are talking caucus to
night, and claiming the support of
members of the Legislature who
squarely assert they will never enter
a secret or open caucus as lone as
Burns is a candidate for the United
States Senate.
Whatever may be the outcome of the
Senatorial contest the fact is evident
that the Grant men, the supporters of
General Barnes, and the followers of
Bulla cannot be coerced or lured into
a secret caucus. The sentiment is
crystallizing that no election would be
better than Burns as Senator. Re
ports received from every section of the
State take the ground that the election
of Burns would disrupt the Republican
party.
From the outset the Burns campaign
has been conducted in a manner to re
pel independent and self-respecting
members of the Legislature. The
talk of railroad employes and volu
ble touts that Burns has only
to snap his fingers to bring six
of Bulla's following and a block of
Grant votes into the Candelaria corral,
has embittered members of the Legis
lature. Dan himself possesses some
tact and conciliatory ability in the
management of his fight, but his chief
lieutenants can get out and make more
enemies in an hour than Burns can
onriliate in a week.
The anti-Burns men are now lined
up so resolutely that come what may
they will take the consequences of re
sisting the election of Burns if the
Legislature remains in session for a
year.
General Barnes arrived from San
Francisco to-night and was greeted by
many of his stanch supporters and
friends. The report was circulated two
or three days ago that he would not
return to the battleground after going
i" San Francisco Saturday for his
usual Sunday visit home. He returns
more confident than ever of winning
the battle for the Senatorahlp. Since
frhe first show-down he has gained two
votesâ Anderson and Knightâ while
Burns, with all the powerful influences
of the Southern Pacific, the assistance
of the "organization" and the presence
ef an aimy of touts, has gained but
three votesâ Wright, Jilson and Simp
son.
There is a report to-night that Thom
as R.. Bard will arrive here to-morrow
and open headquarters.
THE SAST FKAJN CISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1899.
BURNS DENOUNCED FROM
AN ALAMEDA PULPIT
Alameda Office San Francisco Call, i
1428 Park street, Feb. 19.
Rev. C. E. Rich of the Santa Clara aye- I
nut M. E. Church discussed the Senator
ial situation this evening, and during the
course of a sermon entitled "Political
Corruptionâ The Trinity in Unity." said:
"My reference to political parties will
be of the Democratic and Republican
onlyâ not to their peculiar principles, nor
to the rank and file of the votersâ but thÂ«
partieÃ as poetical machines under the
control of party bosses.
"The words Democratic, Republican and
American may be interpreted to mean ab
stractly the same â "the voice of the peo
ple.' Under our form of government the
people assemble in primaries and elect
men as delegates to a convention, which
nominatf-s citizens for public offices; then
the people gather at the polls and vote.
This is theoretically Americanism.
"But what are the facts? Do the peo
ple nominate their choice? Are they not
rather chosen by professional politicians
of unsavory reputation, months ahead, :
under the dictation of a party boss, the '
grip of whose imperative will is gloved in
cunning, and whose avarica and ambition
is tainted by knavery? Aro not caucuses
and primaries and conventions packed,
and the Legislatures controlled by the ,
party boss? Are not nominees pledged to
party fealty, which means cowardly sub
mission to "the will of one man, and that '
man utterly deficient in morals and cap
able only of manipulating schemes for his
own selfish purposes and the enlargement
of his bank account?
"Did not Boss Buckley carry the Dem
ocratic party of San Francisco In his vest
pocket? Did not a vast number of the
officials of that city and teachers in the
public schools and numerous corporations
pay Into his or his lieutenants' pockets a
large percentage of their Incomes? Did
not his henchmen swarm in the lobbies
ready for a consideration, to 'push jobs
by bribing or bulldozing Senators and
Assemblymen already pledged to exe
cute his will? T ask, did the rank and file
of the Democratic party vote for the
nominees of the party or for those of the
"In the late convention of the Repub
lican party. who made the nominations
-the people or Boss Burns? Why was
Dr. Pardee. an every way worthy man
pushed aside to make way for Mr. Gage?
It is evident the boss saw that if a man
was chosen from Central California for
Governor his chances for the United
States Senatorship would be very slim.
So this fellow Burns, who. if the press
statements be true, robbed the State
treasury and should be wearing stripes
behind San Quentin bars, -thrusts aside
the will of the people and nominates the
State ticket. â 
"I affirmâ and who will deny it?â that
for many year 6 the people have had no
voice in the nominations of very many
of the State and city officers, but have
voted their party ticket much against
their own consciences and under the
snap of the party lash as it has t been
crowded upon them by 'the push.'
Referring to the three branches of our
government. Mr. Rich spoke of the leg
islative department as follows:
"This is the Initial In political govern
ment. Here laws originate, appropria
tions are made and debts Incurred. Here
come parties with long purses, who have
axes to grind; here the taxes are sized
up, the State is robbed and the people
cinched; here the party boss finds his
throne; here also prominent officers or tne
Federal Government are chosen. It is
a burning shame that in nine States the
Legislatures are scjuandering the peo
ple s money in the intense oattle for
United States Senatorehip, a position re
quiring intelligence and character of a
very high order.
"Think of a man like Burns aspiring to
such a position. Our State is dishonored
by the shameful aspiring of a thief to
this high position. Think of the bribery
and diabolism openly practiced by Burns
and Grant, men who have secured the
party reins and are recklessly lashing
the team over the down grade.
"The lessons of the hour teach us thÂ©
necessity among men of a political con
science that is not seared with a hot
iron; of American principles only at the
front, recognized and honored; of select
ed men to represent those principles; of
an independent American spirit that al
lows no man or men to dictate the char
acter of the ballot; an organization that
arranges methods of voting for these
principles.
"Why not extend Alameda's plans to
the entire State, obliterating all party
lines and voting only for men loyal to the
people."
WASHINGTON AVER'S FUNERAL
Remains of the Pioneer Laid in Their
Final Besting Place.
Thft funeral of the late Dr. Washington
Ayer was held from the Masonic Temple .
yesterday, at 2 p. m., under the auspices
of Excelsior Lodge No. 166, F. and A. M., |
of which he was a member. The attend- |
ancp was large, hundreds of friends of
the deceased "being nresent to pay a last
tribute of respect to the departed.
In the passing of Dr. Ayer San Fran
cisco loaes a citizen who did much to ad
vance its interest in the days before the j
advent of railroads. Coming to the Pa
cific Coast when a young man. in 1849, he
practically grew up with the country and
hecame prominently identified with the j
affairs of this municipality, which was his
home during the greater part of hi* long ;
life.
A TEN-ROUND FIGHT
FOR M'COY AND GREEN
THE CLEVER KID MUST STOP
THE LOCAL MAN.
Articles Were Signed at the Pavilion
Last Evening in the Presence
of Both Men.
Georga Green, the local middle-weight,
and "Kid" McCoy, light heavy-weight
champion of the world, signed articles
late last evening at the Pavilion to fight
ten rounds in this city. The contest will
take place during April before the club
offering the greatest inducements.
McCoy has agreed to stop Green within
the ten rounds, and if the local man is
on his feet at the end of that time he will
be awarded the decision. There is nothing
in the articles of agreement to prohibit
Green using all the defensive tactics
usually adopted by a man who is boxing
another who is out of his own
class, and it may be very confidently
predicted that the handy middleweight
will use every artifice to stay out the num
ber of rounds. Green's well known abil
ity to take punishment will stand him
well in the contest with the hard-hitting
scientific kid.
Tho sporting fraternity expect to see a
splendid contest of gloves between these
two men. Green in the past has always
been an agreseive puncher, and will
doubtless mix things up in a most inter
esting manner with his antagonist. Both
Green and McCoy were" presenf when the
articles were signed.
MOTHERS OPPOSE ROBERTS.

LASSERE ALIVE AND WELL.
The Missing San Jose Man Writes
From Portland.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 18. â Romain Lassere,
whose mysterious disappearance led his
family and friends to believe he had been
murdered, has turned up in Portland, Or.
His wife received a letter from him to
day.
A little romance surrounds the case.
Lassere left his home on Sunday morning
for San Francisco to purchase some cat
tle. He met another butcher there, and
the latter induced him to take a trip to
Portland. They left on a steamer that
afternoon, but before doing so Luaert
wrote his wife of his intention. This let
ter went astray, and absence of word
from Lassere alarmed his relatives. The
postman brought the lettor on Monday
morning, but Mrs. Lassere wai not at
home. The letter was left on the porch
and a gust of wind blew it into the next
yard.
In tho letter received to-day mention
was made of the letter written from San
Francisco. Mrs. Lassere then began a
search of the premises and in a bunch of
lilies found the first letter. Lassere will
return in a couple of days.

BOGUS LETTERS
TO BOOM BURNS'
HOPELESS CAUSE
Despicable Methods Resorted To by
the Southern Pacific Organ.
Senator Boyce Exposes a "Fake" Letter to
Poor Old Simpson Applauding Him
for His Treachery.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 19.â Senator John
J. Boyce has exposed another one of the schemes of Dan Burns and tne
Southern Pacific Company to deceive legislators for the purpose of pro
moting Burns' candidacy for United States Senator. He has not only
exposed the scheme, but he has laid the lash on the back of the Sacra
mento Record-Union, the railroad paper, v.'hich is responsible for the dis
semination of this latest falsehood meant to delude legislators.
Senator Boyce makes the expose in a letter addressed to the Los
Angeles Times. It is as follows:
SACRAMENTO. Cal.. Feb. 19. 1899.
Sycophantic mendacity usually chacterizes the utterances of every pub
lic journal that surrenders its independent manhood as a guide to public opin
ion and becomes a mere bulletin-board, on which is recorded "train orners
from the Southern Pacific dispatcher's office, and is used for the convenience
of carrying on the details of the system.
I am told that in the past the Record-Union, or its predecessor in journal
ism, wielded an Immense power and influence In- this portion of the State, ann
carried on a "battle royal" against the growing arrogance of the old entra '
Pacific combine, which sought to fasten upon the people of Central California
the shackles of despotic monopoly. The advance of material development in
time strengthened their enemy until the paper was obliged to surrender at
discretion, and the railroad people bought the paper and "good will ot tne
journal which bad so long protected the rights of the people in this vicinit> .
and henceforth it became but the servile creature of its master and has ever
since taken orders from the Central office. Since this paper became the chat
tel of the Southern Pacific Railroad it has become the spokesman of that cor
poration for the purpose of molding public opinion and "setung the pace tor
all other journals upon the Southern Pacific payroll.
This judgment has been slowly formed by careful observation of the
course of the Record-Union for the past few years, but never could be based
upon any concrete proof available tome until, in the course of the develop
ment of the preser* Senatorial contest, one of the tentacles ot the octopus
reached out into an obscure locality, where my absolute familiarity with men
and things brought the proof home to my mind.
In the puerile attempt on the part of the Record-Union, in Its issue of
Sunday. February 19. to show what it is pleased to call "the other side." the
opportunity is offered, and I avail myself thereof.
In this article the paper says: "In view of the fact that some of the
newspapers of the State have been loud in their abuse of Senator Simpson,
who recently changed his vote from Bulla to Burns, it will be interest
ing to note a few of the many letters received by the Senator from Re
publicans throughout the State."
Under this heading we find the following: "Jacob Sharp, a member of
the Common Council of Santa Barbara, wrote a? follows:
" 'T have just been reading an account of your change of vote in the
Los Anjreles Times. If you fail to make them retract, or fail to su*Â» them
for criminal libel, you will disappoint your friends. Dâ n it, I am mad
enough to demand satisfaction myself.' "
My personal familiarity with Santa Barbara and its inhabitants, and
representing them in the public office of Senator from that and the ad
joining County of Ventura, imposes upon me the duty of exposing the meth
ods resorted to by this great journal.
There is not now, and never was, since the existence of a Common Coun
cil of Santa Barbara, any member thereof named Jacob Sharp. There is a
man who has resided in Santa Barbara some years, known as "Jake Shope."
He formerly was a deputy constable in a Justice court and a collector of
bad debts. -
This man ascertained the extent of his popularity in Santa Barbara by
having been defeated at the last election as a candidate for Justice of the
Peace on the Republican ticket, when the city was carried by from 200 to
400 Republican, being defeated for that office by "Old Tom Curley." who has
lived some years in Santa Barbara, and gained a precarious existence as con
stable, deputy constable and auctioneer.
The people of that community, when they chose "Tom Curley" over
"Take Shope" set their estimate on the character of Shope in a most em
phatic fashion. In the opinion of the writer, Shope's communication, if any
such is in existence, received its inspiration from a certain lawyer in Santa
Barbara, who travels on an annual pass and has usually delivered that coun
ty delegation in State conventions according to the orders of the Southern
Pacific political bureau.
These historical facts serve to show the value of such communications
as the Record-Union quotes to bolster up its deeperate cause.

the street railway companies to

JUNEAU, Alaska. Feb. 13 (via Port
Townsend, Wash., Feb. 19).â C. H. Elli
son, one of the most noted trail warm
â¢ers on the 600 miles to Dawson. has
come out of the frozen north swift
footed as Mercury. He was accompa
nied by J. A. Bradley, an athlete of
Titusville, fa., who assisted in setting
the pace.
According to their story, an army of
men is now on the trail to the coast.
Several thousand men have been lying j
around Dawson during the winter, un- |
able to get work or prospect and wait- i
ing for a favorable opportunity to get \
out. The trail hus recently become in j
good condition.
According to Ellison, if one could j
take a bird's eye view from some lofty j
interior mountain peak, thousands of l
disappointed and hard-looking: men j
would be seen hauling their little sleds
and toiling up the icy trail. Some of
these men are literally "on their up
pers," with no money and just enough
"grub" to last them on their trip. Oth- i
ers have little more than their blan- i
kets and only a few pounds of food,
depending on the more fortunate and
the road houses to help them through.
Dogs art high-priced in Dawson,
bringing from $500 to $1000 each, and
â  proportionately low in Skaguay. There
are teams of the best Malamutes in
Dawson which $5000 would not touch.
A single Malamute "to the manor born"
is worth a team of a dozen dogs of
the kind brought up rrom the States.
The serious question nresents itself:
What is Skaguay to do with these men?
Skaguay is the first point they reach
on the coast, except the few who may
come over the Taku trail by way of
Atlin. Many, of course, have money. |
but the vast majority had not enough j
to buy an extra pair of shoes for the
trip out.
This tramping army is estimated at
between 4000 and 5000, and Ellison says
most of them will arrive out in thirty
day?. When he left it looked as thoush
a good sized section of Dawson was
packing up, getting sleds, dogs, har
ness, etc.. preparatory to leaving.
This, of course, will greatly change
the appearance of things in Da\\son.
but the gold is still in the creek beds
and in the sidehill claims of the Klon
â  dike tributaries, and nearly everybody
agrees that as much as, if not more
than, last year will be taken out in
next spring's clean-up. Though it may
bÂ« said of Dawson that "She has seen
better days," and that the boom has j
collapsed, the gold is there for the com- j
parative few who were lucky enough
to seek it first.

applied to the institute for shelter.
Ten days ago James L. Flood, his old
classmate, was married in this city, the
wedding being one of the most sumptu
ous ever seen in Kansas City.
Deweese's father, who lives in St.

Discord Is Caused by the
Illinois Statesman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The Colum
bia Theater was well lulled to-night at
a meeting held under the auspices of
the Societies of the Sons of the Revo
lution and of the American Revolution,
in aid of the fund for the proposed
statue of Lafayette, to be erected by
Americans in Paris during the exposi
tion year. Well known public men and
prominent citizens of the district were
present. The Marine Band furnished
the music and the audience sang patri
otic songs.
Robert J. Thompson of Chicago, sec
retary of the Lafayette Memorial Com
mission and the originator of the idea,
delivered an interesting address.
Representative F. H. Gillett of Mass
achusetts said, among other things:
"To-day the doctrines of Lafayette are
dominant. From us he learned them;
he was the most effective missionary
we sent forth; the noblest personifica
tion of our principles and, in perpetu
ating in Paris his memory, we are per
petuating our loftiest traditions."
Senator Mason of Illinois delivered a
speech in support of the proposed mon
ument. There was one reference which,
however, did not meet with the ap
proval of the entire audience.
"Yes," he said, "Hungary had her
Lafayette, Poland had her Lafayette,
America had her Lafayette and the
Philippines will have their Lafayette."
Loud applause greeted this remark,
but a moment later, when a portion of
the audience realized the aim of this
statement, hisses became 10-uder and
louder.

Little Time Left for

IMPORTANT BILLS IN SENATE
ARMY REORGANIZATION AND
THE APPROPRIATIONS.
Four Important Measures Not Yet
Received From the House Are the
Army, Navy, Fortifications
and Deficiency Sills.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The week
will be a busy one in the Senate. With
only twelve days of the session left all
Senators appreciate the necessity of
very strict and close attention to busi
ness in order to get through the bills
which all admit must become laws in
order to prevent an extra session of
Congress. Very rarely has it occurred
that there have been so many important
measures on the Senate calendar so
short a time before the final adjourn
ment for the last session of Congress.
There, however, are only comparative
ly few of these bills outside of the ap
propriation bills which must neces
sarily be acted upon before adjourn
ment, and if the Senate disposed of
these with the same facility that it has
used in getting rid of other important
bills during the past week, the session
will be closed up in good order and
with time to spare. The army reorgan
ization bill and the census bill are in
reality the only two measures aside
from the appropriation bills upon which
final action would seem absolutely nec
essary. The census bill has passed both
houses and is now in conference and is
reasonably sure of enactment in some
shape. The army bill is yet to receive
the attention of the Senate. Other
measures which will be pressed to a
certain extent are the Alaskan code
bill, the Hawaiian territorial organiza
tion bill, and various other bills per
taining to Hawaii.
A contest over the army bill, which
was promised for last week, was post
poned until the present week, largely
because the storm of the first days of
the week prevented consideration of the
bill by the military committee. Senator
Hawley, chairman of the Committee on
Military Affairs, has given notice that
he will proceed to have the bill taken
up for consideration immediately after
the disposal of the routine business
Monday morning. He will iirst ask for
unanimous consent to take the bill uu.
and if this is refused will make a mo
tion to this effect. There is no prob
ability that the bill will not be taken
up, as the Democrats as well as the
Republicans concede the necessity for
some legislation leasing the army to
cover the prest. .nergency. With the
bill once before me Senate, Senator
Cockrell will proceed to give the rea
sons of the opposition to a permanent
increase in the army, and he will be
followed by other Senators in the oddo
sition so long as no disposition is man
ifested to abandon at least some por
tions of the House bill.
The vital point of difference between
the two bodies of the chamber is the
duration of time for. which the increase
of the army is made. Republicans de
mand that it shall be permanent and
the Democrats refuse to make it more
! than temporary. The latter declare
that they will not abandon their posi
tion and say that whatever is done
must be done with this understanding.
Some of the friends of they bill have
suggested the acceptance of* the Hull
bill, with an amendment making the
increase for only a specified time: but
the Democrats generally manifest a
I disposition not to accept this change,
!as they say it would leave the way
I open for the Republicans to get the
'â  legislation they want in the next Con
j gress by repealing the temporary pro
vision. So far no tangible basis for a
compromise has been suggested on
either side, but some of the most influ
ential members of the Senate are work
ing to that end, and the prediction is
freely made that they will succeed be
fore the close of the session. It has
never been supposed that any common
ground would be found until the cham
pions on the two sides should have an
opportunity to test the metal of each
other's weapons. This opportunity will
come Monday and it expected on
Tuesday a chance will be found for a
conference locking to an agreement.
This opportunity will be afforded by
taking up the river and harbor bill, if
present plans are carried into effect.
Of the supply bills, the aenate now
has before it only th- lostoffice appro
priation bill and the river and harbor
bill. Of these the postofflce bill has re
ceived partial attention and the river
and harbor bill none. It is expected
that the sundry civil bill will be re
ported late in the week. The river and
harbor bill will probably arouse con
siderable discussion, and there will be
an effort to defeat the Nicaragua canal
amendment on a point of order.
There are still four important appro
priation bills, namely, the army, navy,
fortifications and deficiency bills, which
have not yet been received from < the
House of Representatives.
Senator Cullom says he will make an
effort to get up the general bill provid
ing a government for Hawaii, but the
chances of success are very slim. Sen
ator Fairbanks will also undertake to
call up the bill extending the anti-con
tract labor laws to Hawaii. There may
be an effort to amend this measure and
it also may fail. Senator Carter will
continue to press the Alaskan bill when
ever opportunity affords.
The Sampson-Schley controversy will
almost certainly come up in executive
session. The anti-scalping bill will be
abandoned. For the rest, there are
many minor bills on the calendar which
will give the Senate plenty to do when
it is not engaged with the more mo
mentous questions. Wednesday will be
devoted to the reading of Washington's
farewell address and to eulogy on the
late Senator Morrlll.

MAD DOG SLAIN ON
A SALINAS STREET
Pursues Little Children and Causes Much
Excitement Before Its Career Is
Cut Short.
SALINAS, Feb. 19.â A mad dog, something almost unheard of in
California, has been shot in this city after having run amuck in the
streets as well as in private yards on the east side of town, chasing little
children and stirring up things generally.
The canine, a large black animal, was first noticed by residents on
Front street. Two little children of W. N. Vanderhurst, who were on
the street at the time the dc-g first appeared, were pursued by the rabid
creature. They ran as fast as possible into the yard, the dog after them.
A neighbor who had heard the screams of the children procured his
gun and went in pursuit. He shot the animal, but only stunned it.
This shot attracted other people, who entered the chase. The dog would
bite anything with which it came into contact, and all the time foamed
at the mouth. Before it was killed four bullets entered its body. Dr.
Faulkner, the county veterinary sugeon, announced the case as one of
genuine rabies.
AMERICAN TRADE
WITH GERMANY
Conditions Are Most
Satisfactory.
HIGH WATER MARK REACHED
NINETY-SEVEN THE BANNER
YEAR.
Robert P. Porter Says There Is No
Danger of Commercial Difficulty
Between the Two
Countries.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Preag.
LONDON, Feb. 19.â 1n an interview
with the correspondent of the Associ
ated Press last evening, Robert P. Por
ter, who goes to Berlin to-morrow, ex
plained at some length the objects of
his mission, prefacing his remarks
with the statement that since the war
with Spain many continental countries
had shown a disposition to make un
friendly discrimination against Ameri
can products.
Referring to the recent statement in
the Reichstag by Count yon Posadow
sky-Wehner, German Imperial Secre
tary of State for the Interior, on the
subject of the trade development of the
United States with Germany, he said
a close study of the question did not
warrant the conclusions drawn by
Count yon Posadowsky-Wehner. On
the contrary, it showed most satisfac
tory and profitable trade conditions so
far as Germany was concerned.
"In 1897," said Mr. Porter, "German
imports into the United States reached
high water markâ Â£l2,ooo,ooo or Â£15,
--000,000 higher than in any other year
during the decade then ending. The
decline for 1898 was almost wholly due
to the decreased sugar importation.
The healthy feature of American im
ports into Germany, in my opinion, lies
in the fact that of the $150,000,000 in
1898, over half was composed of raw
cotton, petroleum, tobacco, copper and
the like, mostly for conversion into
manufactured articles, giving employ
ment to German labor.
"Large imports of raw material, es
pecially when a country does not pro
duce raw material itself, are a source
of wealth rather than loss to a country
like Germany. There can be no com
mercial difficulty between the United
States and Germany, because, apart
from Great Britain, America is knit
more closely to Germany by bonds of
kinship or mutual interests than te any
other power. Individual interests may
clash, but a fair analysis of the bal
ance sheet of the two nations shows
a healthful cc-ndition of trade, which
is the subject for rejoicing rather than
alarm on both sides. "
With reference to his visit to the
West Indies, Mr. Porter said that many
of his suggestions regarding Cuba and
Porto Rico were based in a measure
on what he had observed in Jarnacia.
In concluding the interview, he highly
praised the success of the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, Joseph Cham
berlain, in dealing with Great Britain's
West Indian administration.
MAJOR WILSON IS CRAZY.
Such Is the Belief of the Frienas of

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Feb. 19.âC01

day to arrange details for the departure
of his regiment, the Third Immunes,
next month. He also will appear as a
witness to-morrow in the trial by court
martial of Major Edward Wilson on
charges of forgery and embezzlement.
The general orinion is that Major Wil
son is out of his mind. The evidence
thus far given shows Wilson s offenses
to have been greater than was indi
cated by his confession. ,

CLOVERDALE, Feb. 19.â This was a
day of rest at the citrus fair. The
doors were open only a part of the day
for the visitors, who came to view its
beauties between trains and also for
the people from nearby towns who
came in carriages, the beau and his
sweetheart, the staid busy man of six
days with his family out for recreation,
change and rest. The weather was per
fect, the sunshine tampered by a re
freshing western breeze.
To the sentimentally inclined visitor
it was a rare treat to be inside the
pavilion this morning. A half hundred
canaries poured forth a sweet lyre of
praise to their pretty surroundings, the
harmony of sound being made com
plete by the chimes of the church bells
proclaiming this the Sabbath day. The
eye, resting upon the fairy scene
around, could but inspire the visitor
with a feeling of thankfulness to a
beseficent One for His great goodness
and the favors shown to this land of
sunshine, fruit and flowers.
The exhibits are all looking fresh and
attractive as ever, and will be renewed
with greeneries and new decorations

of Yellow Mountain, about a quarter of
a mile below the town of Ophir. this
afternoon, and killed one man and
practically destroyed the Caribou con

visible from the town of Ophir. and
those who saw it say it was the larg

being about 100 feet deep and irtore
than a quarter of a mile wide.
The Caribou mill was crushed like

force of men has been digging for Var

evening.
Mighty slides have been runnine: all

PAPERS READ IN THE
COUNCIL OF WOMEN
National Organization Brings Ita
Washington Session to a
Close.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â There was a
large attendance at the final public meet
ing at the Church of Our Father of tha
triennial session of the National Coun
cil of Women. Several interesting papers
were read. The business of the council
will be closed at a secret session to-mor
row.
The first paper to-day was by Mary
Newbury Adams of lowa, entitled "St.
Hilda of Whitbyâ How Abbesses Were
Educators and Civilizers." She briefly
reviewed the life of this remarkable
woman and of her work at Whitby. In
every historic epoch, she said, there was
found an organizing genius, who brought
to a focus the interests of the people
with an appreciation of the learning of
other ages. St. Hiiida was such a genius
for the English language 1200 years ago.
She was an example of a mother of lit
eratureâthose who prepared the home
for the gifted and kept brightest the fires
of genius, making for all time perfect
conditions for those who can do and
speak.
Elizabeth B. Grannis of Xew York
read a scholarly paper, entitled "Is the
Church Universal a Hindrance or a Help
to the Development of Womankind?"
Christ, she said, came to establish the
church universal, and there could be no
justification for any division, branch or
denomination of the church. It should
ever hold the banner of unity aloft and
should work individually and collectively
to make visible the oneness of the church
of Christ throughout the world.
"The Message of the Madonna," by
Elizabeth Boynton Harbert of Illinois
closed the meeting.
WOMAN ATTACKED BY
AN ENRAGED HORSE
The Wife of Pacific Grove's Postmas
ter Receives Serious
Injuries.
PACIFIC GROVE, Feb. 19.â Mrs. C. G.
Chamberlain, wife of the Postmaster of
Pacific Grove, was attacked by an en
raged horse to-day, and received serious
injuries about the head and face. Mrs.
Chamberlain tried to drive away a stray
horse which was doing damage to plants.
It appears the animal had a habit of
chasing people, because of its having been
tormented by boys. As Mrs. Chamber
. lain raised her hands the brute sprang
over the low fence of the yard and rushed
at her. She turned and fled toward the
porch and fell. It is not known whether
in this fall or by the animal jumping
over her and striking her with the hoof
she sustained the injury. At any rate
a long and deep cut on the forehead had
to be attended to. Mrs. Chamberlain, it
is believed, will recover, although, she
may lose the use of one eye.
SPANIARDS OCCUPIED
VANCOUVER ISLAND
Discovery of a Document Proving
Their Former Right to North

SEATTLE, Feb. 19.â The Post-TntelU
gencer published this morning: for the
first time an old Spanish document culled
from military records left in Mexico by the
Spaniards during the days of their ascend
ancy in the western portion of the United
States .and showing beyond dispute that
Spain held and occupied Nootka Sound,
on Vancouver Island, as late as 1793, both
prior to and subsequent to the arriveal of
Mackenzie at latitude 51 degrees 21 min

ThjE WEATHER fIND TRADE.
THE effect of weather upon trade is forcibly
shown by the decline in the country's bank
Li-ings last week to a mere 254 per cent gain
over the same week last year, whereas the gain of late
Jias been ranging from 25 to over 50 per cent. About
: half of the cities and more important towns showed a
los~. The blizzard played havoc while it lasted. The
.tion of merchandise was practically sus
â¢ pended for several days, passenger traffic was seri
. interrupted and merchandising in country towns
in the West and Northwest came to a temporary
â¢ standstill. ' The flocks and herds of the whole country,
already depleted, suffered losses from freezing. And,
worse still, the orchards from the Missouri River to
â¢the Atlantic coast and from Michigan to Florida were
deprived of the major part of their forthcoming crop,
and in some States were killed outright. This was
notably the case with the peach orchards of Michigan,
. Delaware and Georgia, three leading peach States of
.'the Union. The destruction was so general that we
are told that the United States will have to look to
â¢California for peaches this year. The wheat crop, too,
i! is feared, has been cut down by the terrible weather.
But the storm is over and business has been re
sumed with a rush. The promptness and vigor of
the revival are surprising. Evidently there is plenty of
good blood in the commercial body, or it would not
' .revive with such force. Wall street was especially
.lit. and developed unexpected strength, though
the volume of business was not up to the previous
level. The buoyancy was helped by the continued
good showing of the railroad earnings, and by the
fact that London has ceased to throw our securities
brck at us. The West reported a good demand for
spring account in spite of the incomplete resumption
â¢of railroad transportation. The condition of the iron
â trade was well illustrated by the enormous increase
in bank clearings at Pittsburg, the gain over the same
â  week last year being m per cent. This industry still
â¢ leads all others in point of activity. The other promi
nent staples, such as wool, cotton, hides, leather,
' boots and shoes, wheat, corn, etc., exhibited no par
ticular change during the week.
â  Mention has already been made of the recently born
eagerness in the East to form trusts and all sorts of
trade and financial combinations. In some quarters
this tendency is being viewed with distrust, not to
say apprehension; but the banks are showing them
selves very conservative regarding all new ventures
of this class, and this acts as a check to overspecula
tion, so the long heads see nothing alarming in it.
â¢ Combinations become automatic after a while and
regulate themselves. If they are-topheavy they go to
â  the wall of their own gravity and hurt noboody but I
â¢those immediately concerned in them. This is the
daily history of trade in every form.
The local, like the Eastern, situation is at present
the plaything of the weather. But here it is not the
storm, but the lack of one, that is affecting business.
We have now been over a month without rain, and^
while no district is actually suffering, we shall need
rain everywhere very soon to mature the crops. At
the moment the question is of feed, not seed. The
crops are looking all right, but the pasturage is un
deniably deficient. Even in the coast counties the
grass is too short and backward, and the farmers and
stockmen are feeding their cattle and sheep hay, some
thing unprecedented in former years. The sown
crops are green and growing, but the growth is slow
and the plant is of short staple. Scattering rains
from now on, however, will bring it out all right.
Under these conditions the merchants are naturally
conservative, but business throughout the Ftate is
vtry fair, nevertheless. Failures are small and few,
collections are up to the average, money is plentiful
and readily available to solvent borrowers at the
usual rates, and with a good rain in a few days the
commercial situation will be rosy enough to suit even
the chronic croaker, who, like the poor, is always
â with us.
Whether the volunteers shall be kept in service for
two years is a question, but as to the power of the
Government to keep them there there seems no room
for doubt. This does .not alter the fact that the Alger
threat of retaining them until he shall have been pro
vided with a regular army the size he wants was a
bluff.
While there is seldom excuse for interfering with a
family quarrel, there surely can be no wrong in stating
that the Oakland woman who poured acid into the
i3.ee of her husband should be sent to jail or to an
asylum for the rest of her life.
In the sad fate of Lieutenant Neall there ought to
be a lesson, but the world has had the benefit of many
limilar lessons.
the: senatorial deadlock
THE treachery of Dan Burns to the. Republican
party and his complete willingness to turn the
State over to the Democracy in 1900 are becom
ing more apparent every day. His tactics art upon Ml
exact level with himself and correspond to his politi
cal experience as a railroad hireling. Any falsehood
is told or any contradiction tolerated to make votes
lor him. Senator Simpson was induced to play Judas j
to Mr. Bulla in direct opposition to his own pledges
and to the Republican organization of hi* own to
cality. Thus, for , some unexplained consideration.
this wretched old sinner incurred personal degrada*
tion and popular wrath to a degree thai cannot fail to
irjure his party in the next Presidential campaign.
Here is an instance of a direct slap in the fact admin*
fettered by Burns and the railroad to the Republican
voters in one Senatorial district. In other part* of
the State the railroad machinery is brought to bear on
Republican central committees, and, although it ha*
usually failed, in some instances it ha) succeeded,
Such was the case in Ventura County, where a resolu
tion was adopted requesting Assemblyman GrccnwcU
to transfer his vote from Grant to Thomas R lUird,
Greenwell, however, had made the transfer in advance
of the resolution. Upon its face tin's proceeding was
plausible. As The Call stated on Saturday last, Mr.
Bard, who resides in Ventura County, is .m influential
and a reputable citizen, and if the intention had been
in good faith to give him the vote of his own Assem
bly district even at this late day the compliment
would not be censurable. But if. as many believe,
the plan is to weaken Grant, up to this tune the BIOS!
formidable competitor of Burns, and when this has
been done to transfer the vote to the Mexican and
railroad candidate, then an act that might have been
innocent is turned into a shameless iniquity.
The Call repeats its warning against these homi
cidal attacks upon the Republican party. The dead
: lock would never have existed but tor the candidacy
O. Burns. It could have been broken weeks ago but
for the obstinacy of the railroad and its braren dis^
â regard of its own professions during the campaign of
1898. All that was necessary was the withdrawal of
this defaulter to the State, possessing no qualifications
and every disqualification, backed only by corruption
and repudiated by the mass of his fellow-citizens. A
deadlock is greatly to. be deprecated and may beat the
party in 1900, but the election of Burns would sen.! it
to irretrievable destruction, and if both results are
attained the railroad will have won its entire fight.
There never was an opportunity for the Republican
party of California, with its grand history behind it,
so completely to indicate its principles and its in
tegrity. It can grasp the situation as it really is and
assume an attitude that for years to come will keep
it the dominant political organization of the State. It i
won the last election on its own merits and on the !
distinct assertion and belief that the railroad was out
of politics. Let it now hold the railroad to its own
declarations and defeat its concealed purpose to turn
a subsidized and inferior agent into a Senator of the I
United States. Let Burns and Grant be set aside and j
the standard of statesmanship and integrity sub- j
stituted for the debasing exhibition that has so far i
marred the legislative session. Let the "grandeur" of
Dan Burns' Republicanism glisten solely in the mud
in which it originated, and, following the example of 1
Indiana and the lofty ideals of the past, let the dead- I
lock be broken and the future ascendency of the party
in this State secured by the prompt election of a Re
publican, a statesman and a gentleman.
AN EASTERN DELUSION.
A RECENT debate in the Prussian Diet on the
outlook of the sugar industry has given rise to
no little exultation among our contemporaries
of Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Their de
light is due to an agreement on the part of the Prus
sian statesmen that under American administration
Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines will produce so
much sugar that the beet sugar industry of the tem
perate regions of the earth will be well nigh unprofit
able.
Commenting upon the outlook, the Eastern papers
maintain that while the development of the West
Indies and the Philippines will be bad for Germany
it will be very good for the United States, inasmuch
as it will save us from having to import sugar from
abroad. The argument is that from the enlarged out
put of the islands the people of the United States will
derive a clear profit undiminished by any loss.
As one of our exchanges puts it: "A line in our
tariff giving Cuban and Porto Rico sugars a prefer
ence of a fraction of a cent a pound over the bounty
fed sugar of Germany, and the islands would be
worked to their utmost capacity. More than that, such
a preference would stimulate all the other sugar
growing West Indies, English, Dutch and French, to
apply for annexation. If they got it, they would all
prosper, and our market would be very nearly if not
wholly supplied."
This roseate view of the prospect is due to an illu
sion rather than to anything in the reality. America
as well as Germany has a beet sugar industry at stake.
The enormous stimulation of sugar production in the !
islands which would result from the free importation
of the product to this country would affect the en
tire West from Nebraska to California. It would
ruin one of the most promising of our rural indus
tries and check the prosperity of thousands of farm
ers who are now engaged in the cultivation of the
sugar beet.
Our Eastern contemporaries are taking too nar
row a survey of the situation. They perceive what
they regard as a prospective benefit to the East, and,
pleased with the promise, pay no attention to the in
terests of the West. It is certain, however, that even
from the standpoint of Eastern interests they are mis
taken. Eastern manufacturers have no better market
than that afforded by the growing West, and what
ever injures the West is sure to react upon the East.
There is indeed no aspect of imperialism that is
genuinely favorable to the interests of the people of
the United States. If the mongrel islanders prove
recalcitrant it will cost us much to subdue and keep
j them in order. If they prove to be willing workers
the competition of their cheap labor will be costly to
American industry in many ways.
Without imperial colonization and conquest we
can and will in a short time build up a sugar industry
in the United States capable of supplying all the
sugar our market demands. With imperialism we
shall check that industry and have our source of sup
ply far away instead of at home. Qur welfare as well
as that of Germany is at stake in the issue. It is a
delusion to think otherwise.
THE MERCANTILE LIBRARY.
AFTER a long discussion of ways and means the
trustees of the Mercantile Library have devised
a method of raising money which promises to
provide the institution with a sum sufficient to clear
off the incumbrances and give it a sound financial
standing.
The method proposed h the simple one of
a direct appeal to the liberality and public
spirit of the citizens. A committee of one

hundred has been appointed, each of whom
agrees to raise , $1000. If all succeed in : the
undertaking $100,000 will be added to the treasury of
the library, and once more the institution will have a
fail 1 prospect Â«of that prosperous career. to which it is
entitled by reason of its history: and its usefulness to
the community.'
That the citizens generally should make a prompt
and liberal response to this appeal goes without say

exercise of their patriotism, .
The ease and rapidity with which the tnisls wns met
and overcome are the more remarkable because the
I iVsue was precipitated wholly unexpectedly and .it a
time when the French icemad to outsiders to be in
capable of acting reasonably upon any subject. For
months past we have been reading of stormy sessions
in the Chamber of Deputies, of riots on the streets,
! of angry criminations and recriminations between the
rival parties in the country and of intrigues and con
spiracies in the army and among the clericals. Basing
their conclusions upon the conspicuous features of
this turmoil, not a few prophets have been freely pre
dicting the speedy downfall of the republic. The ex
pression has been common that the French are in
capable of self-government, and that a race so ex
citable cannot, maintain a stable administration. .;
What has happened is only another proof that
the French are different from some other people, but
not worse than other people. Their natural vivacity
is such that every argument sounds to our ears as
something very much like a quarrel. We mistake the
vehemence of their eloquence for a sign of an ill-bal
anced intellect. We shall after a while come to learn
that an uproar in Paris does not mean that any one
wishes to fight, but only that every one wishes to
talk. When a real danger is to ", be confronted the
Gaul can be as wary as any other man, and is not
going to ruin his nation for the sake of his party.'T
. The conscious strength of the conservative Repub
licans was shown by the easy toleration of the little
outbursts made by the radicals on one side and the
imperialists on the other. No attempt was made to
suppress them by military force. They were per
mitted to play their parts during the day as they
thought best, and the election went surely on to the
conclusion that the conservative will of the people
desired.
Clearly the French republic has come to stay. It
is doubly secure in its own strength and in the weak
ness of its opponents. Neither the radicals, the im
perialists nor the monarchists have either a leader or
a principle around which they can rally enough people
to do more than create an uproar on the boulevards.
President Loubet may not prove to be a great man,
but he promises to be a safe statesman; and as affairs
are going in these days that is better than greatness.
PREPARING A WELCOME.
NO little gratification will be felt in the city, and
indeed throughout the State, over the an
nouncement that the Native Sons have under
taken the work of preparing a suitable reception for
the California Volunteers when they return from Ma
nila. It is everywhere recognized that some formal and
stately welcome should be given to the heroes of the
State on their arrival at home, and no body of citi
zens is better fitted to arrange the ceremony or can
more appropriately carry it out than the Native Sons.
It is stated that a majority of the members of the
volunteers and of the heavy artillery are natives of
California, and a considerable proportion of them are
affiliated with the Native Sons organization. The
welcome that is being prepared for them will there
fore have in it something of fraternal cordiality as
well as State pride. The occasion of the greeting will
be one of no little moment to the city and will no
doubt be carried out upon a scale that will give it a
high rank among the festal records of the city.
The reception given in the Eastern cities to their
volunteers as they came home from Santiago was in
the nature of a spontaneous outburst of popular en
thusiasm and patriotic pride. The warmth of the wel
come thus given was largely increased by the excite
ment of the war and the flush of victories which were
then still fresh in the public mind. Those feelings
will to a considerable extent have passed away before
the California troops return. The excitement of the
battle with Spain is over and we are now engaged in
the comparatively dull task of discussing how we shall
pay the war debt and what we shall do with the Phil
ippines. It is therefore advisable that we should pre
pare to receive our returning troops with something
more than a mere outburst of street- applause. They
should be greeted with the highest honors their fel
low-citizens can bestow, and all will note with pleas
ure that the Native Sons are resolved their welcome
shall be so given.
AN editorial entitled 'The Act of a Traitor" was
reproduced in The Call Saturday morning,
and by accident credited to the Sacramento
Bee. It should have been credited to the Los An
geles Express.
The Pioneers and the Masons united yesterday in
obsequies over the body of Dr. Washington Ayer,
who had held several important municipal offices in
this city. It was truthfully said of him that during a
residence of fifty years his personal or his political in

would be valuable even in the Senate of the United
States.

bad condition. .
"This bad condition," says Mr. Bid-
Ktrup, "has been brought about by vari-
OUR causes. Principal among these is the
dispute between Chile and the Argentine i
Rnpublio over the boundary. This has
boon, a bone of contention between the
two countries for forty years, but last
M.'iv It assumed, a critical aspect, and
Caused a good-sized war scare. The prop
osition .was . referred to a commission,
Which surveyed, the Cordilleras and prac
tically established the boundary line, but
there were other questions on which the
opposing, interests could not agree, and
Queen Victoria was at last appealed to to
arbitrate the differences. The two coun
tries say they will abide by the decision,
but Chile is very much afraid that the
Argentine Republic is not sincere in its
promise. Business interests have been
cripnled by this hull-headedness over a
atrip of land which is really valueless. It
Is a barren tract extending from Tacne
on the north down toward the Straits of
Magellan, to a point east of Punta Are
nas, and is about twenty leagues wide,
with no habitation or vegetation, yet both
sides lay claim to it.
"Another cause of the depressed condi
tions is the manipulation of the money
market by a combination of bankers, who
prevailed on thÂ« Chilean Congress to is
sue fifty million pesos in paper currency,
and the result has been that gold went up
to 47 per cent premium, and silver 18 per
cent over the paper money. The Govern
ment established the gold standard in 1832,
and a coin of eighteen penniques, or thir
ty-five cents in American money, was
minted. After the paper was floated it
was possible to buy twenty-one pesos for
$5 In gold. Of course it is Impossible to
carry on an importing business under
that high rate of exchange. The customs
duties are payable in gold and the Gov
ernment holds an auction every Monday
â¢and sells the yellow metal to the highest
bidder. Naturally there is a great scarc
ity of gold. Capital is disinclined to make
Investments under the existing conditions,
though there is considerable undeveloped
mining property.
. "Valparaiso Is'absolutely at a standstill
and her citizens will be glad to tide over
the trouble. Santiago, the capital, with
it 5.400,000. 400,000 people, is little better off. Ar
ffcntlne Republic Is more prosperous, and
as more resources. â¢* Â» v â  "
"The salvation of Chile is to settle for
all time the boundary question. She must
also reduce her navy, â  the expense of
which is rapidly draining her resources.
She has but 8000 soldiers, while Argentina
has over 10,000, and though her navy is
not so great, I take it that she would
prove victorious in a struggle with Chile.
"President Errazuriz of Chile is a lib
eral, but has not much power and is not
well liked. The party of Balmaceda, who
was deposed . some years ago. is growing
stronger every day and at the next ejec
tion, two years hence, it may assume the
reins of government."
LEGISLATIVE
MONSTROSITIES
It is surprising to note with what
equanimity the newspapers in Califor
nia regard the twin monstrosities, the
Works bill and the Morehouse bill; one,
if it becomes a law, will place in the
power of every disappointed scoundrelly
offlceseeker to sue for libel or damages
without any provocation or without
even filing a bond, and annoy out of
existence nine-tenths of the poverty
stricken country papers which have not
sufficient funds to keep even, much less
defend law suits filed by irresponsible
scrubs. The other virtually gives a
right to shoot in the back any news
paper man who has the courage to ex
pose their villainy, and it will be a shot
in the back every time, for the framers
and advocates of such a bill have not
the sand to approach even a country
editor in front.
Newspapers sometimes carry things
to the extremes, but as a general thing
they have a good foundation and ample
proof for all they print, and are amen
able to the law at present, the same as
others. They enjoy no special privi
leges and the people should protest
against legislating any special favors
to the rascals who are afraid of the
truth. â Willows Journal.
WATER FOR PRECITA VALLEY.
Plan to Cut Through Bernal Heights
to Cortland Avenue.
At a meeting of the Preclta Valley Im
provement Club, held at Graham's Hall
on Alabama street Friday night, the ex
ecutive committee reported that Engineer
Schusler of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany had promised to have hydrants set
on Preclta avenue just as soon as the
mains were laid along the street line. It
is the intention of the water company to
put its men to work In laying mains from
Folsom street to San Bruno avenue dur
ing the coming week.
President Vizzard stated that the con
tract for the filling In of Bernal Park will
be signed in the course of a few days.
This information was hailed with delight
as it was one of the principal objects for
which the club was organized.
An effort will now be made to have Ala
bama street graded from Proeita to
Cortland avenue, which will moan the
piercing of Bernal Heights and the open
ing up of new southern territory behind
the hill, where there is already a settle
ment of industrious property owners.
PARK AND CLIFF.
Thousands Visit the City's Pleasure
Grounds for Sunday Outing.
Rarely has the crowd that was on the
beach yesterday been exceeded in num
bers. From the Cliff House as far as the
eye could reach the surf-beaten shore was
studded with humanity. The same condi
tions existed In the Park and all suburban
amusement resorts.
From 4 till S p. m. the cars returning
from the Park and Cliff were packed to
the limit. The Chutes, Sutro Heights and
the Cliff House were the favored places
and were thronged all day long.
Early In the morning the attendants of
the Park Emergency Hospital were called
upon to sew up an eye wound which Har
ry Verges received while attempting to
pass before an Ellis street ear with his
laundry wagon. G. Verges, his father
was also slightly injured. They reside at
I 513 Haight street, and are proprietors of
ia French laundry.
The kangaroo at the Park gave birth
to two babies yesterday, which she im
mediately secreted in her ventral pouch.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The French â  armored 'cruiser D'Entre
castaux Is still .undergoing steam trials.
She was launched over two years ago and
since her completion has been trying to
develop the ( - designed horse power and
speed. The design called for 13,500 horse
power and 19 knots, but the best results
so far have been 10,547 horse power and
18.45 knots. â  â¢
The British battleship Victorious is
proving herself to be an undesirable ves
sel on the China station because of her
great draught of water. She has not been
docked for ten months and there is only
one dock in the Far East that can take
her in. This is the Kowloon dock at
Shanghai, but the difficulty of docking
her is also greatly Increased by the swift
tide running past the dock entrance and
a risk is run. The Victoria draws nearly
twenty-eight feet of water, and there are
but few ports in Asiatic waters where she
can lie comfortably.
Italian naval appropriations allow $4,
--800,000 for new building during the coming
fiscal year. The vessels under construc
tion number twenty, of which nine are
torpedo boats, the others are " battleships
and armored cruisers. Notable among
the latter are Amiraglio Brin and Regina
Margherlta, sister ships, of 12,675 tons, 433
feet 4 inches in length, 27 feet 6 Inches
draught, and Intended to make a speed of
20 knots. The sum of $840,000 is to be ex
pended upon these two vessels during the
coming year, which will nearly complete
the Brin.
Penalties for exceeding f he time limit
on contract built ships are rarely enforced
in any navy in times of peace. In the j
United States navy the penalty clause is
entirely ignored, and the British Ad
miralty appears to be equally lenient with
Its contractors. In 1894 contracts for six
torpedo-boat destroyers were signed, to be j
delivered by March 30, 1895. None had i
been delivered up to March 31, 1897, and j
the penalties amounted to $350,000. It was :
not until January 6. 1898, that the first de
livery was made, and it is tacitly under
stood that there will be no demand made
for payment of penalties.
Russian specialists claim to have solved
the successful use of petroleum fuel on
board of ships. A splendid result was ob
tained in the trial of the machinery of the
Rotislav. The success is attributed to a
new process of pulverizing petroleum res
idue by mechanical (pneumatic) means in
stead of by steam as. formerly. The en
gines of the Rotislav greatly exceeded the
contract and gave the ship nearly two
knots more speed than anticipated, and
during six hours at full speed showed the
great advantage which liquid fuel, when
treated by the new method, has over coal
It is proposed to erect at St. Petersburg
two large reservoirs capable of holding
6500 tons of petroleum.
One year ago Great Britain and France
were practically the only naval powers
that had coaling stations abroad, and the
former was especially well provided it be
ing possible for her fleets to proceed to
any part of the globe without running
the risk of getting short of coal. The coal
ing stations of France are unimportant
carrying but small supplies, and are in
differently protected. The United States

LONG PASSAGES
Over a Dozen Are Now
Fully Due.
FLEET DETAINED AT PANAMA

VESSEL! TIED UP.
City of Para Loaded by the Crews of
Other Steamersâ No Rush of
Visitors to the
lowa.
The British ship Centeslma arrived from
Newcastle. N. S. \\\, yesterday after a
long passage of eighty-two days. Light
winds and calms delayed the vessel, the
only exciting; incident during the voyage
being a terrific thunder and lightning
storm, encountered in 20 south latitude.
Over a dozen deep water vessels are
now fully due, and the pilots are girding
up their loins in anticipation of a busy
week. A heavy westerly swell has b~*Â»n
setting inshore for several days, and Pilot
F. Jordan reasons from this that there
must be a breeze off shore somewhere
that will bring the fleet along. 'j.^e
Centesima was the first of the expected
vessels, and the others should come drop
ping in one or two at a time during the
week.
The American ship Erekine M. Phelps,
which is now out 146 days from Baltimore,
is fully due. She is a new vessel, on her
maiden voyage, and is commanded by
Captain Graham, formerly of the \\ liiiam
F. Babcock. The British ships Inchcape
Rock and Talus are out 144 and 143 days
respectively from Cardiff. The Inchcape
Rock is making an unusually Ion? voy
age for her, while Captain Stenhouse of
the Talus is noted for his quick passages.
The ship Riversdale is out 134 days from
Hamburg, the Bidston Hfil 130 days from
London, the Cederbank lou and Primrose
Hill 138 days from Newcastle, England,
the Brussels 88, Cardigan Castle 77 and
Brenda 65 days from Newcastle, Austra
lia; the American ship M. P. Grace 91
and the British ship Orown of India 71
days from Sydney, N. S.W., and the brig
Galilee 36 days from Tahiti. All these
vessels will have tales of light winds and
calms to tell when they reach port.
The Crown of India is really 291 days
out from Newcastle, N. S. W., for San
Francisco. When 150 miles off the coast
of New South Wales she was caught in
a hurricane and dismasted. After being
given up as lost she was picked up by a
tug and towed Into Sydney t N. S. W. New
masts and yards for her nad to be pro
cured from England, and it was Decem
ber 11 last hefore she was ready to sail
for San Francisco again.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
City of Para arrived from Panama and
way ports. She brought up an unusually
heavy cargo, and it was late in the af
ternoon before she was got into her berth.
At Panama the strike was still on. 'me
'longshoremen who handled the freigut
were getting $1 75 in silver and de
manded $2. When their demand was re
fused they marched out, and soon the
freight from New York began to pile up
at Panama. Just as the railroad com
pany was about to give in the strikers de
manded $1 in gold, which is equal to $2 75
in silver.
When the Para left Panama the Mail
Company's steamers San Bias, San Juan,
Acapulco and Starbuck" were tied up
awaiting cargoes. The crews of these
vessels pitched in and loaded the City
of Para, or else she also would have had
to tie up. The railroad company was try
ing to Dring in laborers from Fortuna
Island, but the venture was not a suc
cess, and the chances were favorable for
the continuance of the deadlock.
Besides her New York cargo the City
of Para brougi.t up 13.252 sacks of coffee
and 8322 sacks of sugar from Central
Amercia. She had fourteen cabin and
seventeen steerage passengers. Among
those in the cabin were Baron A. Jacob
de Kaustein, an Austrian nobleman "vho

Mexico for some years, returned to
America on the Para for a visit.
There was not the expected rush to the
battle-ship lowa yesterday, and in conse
quence many of the tugs and stern-wheel
steamers did not pay for the coal they

WOUNDING OF
CHAS. HAWLEY
Found Dying on Grant
Avenue.
HIS SKULL IS FRACTURED
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN
STRUCK BY A THUG.
The Police Make an Investigation,
but Are Unable to Ascertain
Whether or Not He Was
Assaulted,
Policeman Fennell, while patrolling his
beat on Grant avenue last night, found a
well-dressed young man lying on the siue
. walk near Geary street in an unconscious
condition. , Blood was flowing from 'his
nose, and a deep cut over his left eye in
dicated that he had been assaulted. Fen
nell, realizing that it was a serious case,
lost no time in having the man conveyed
. to the Receiving Hospital. An examina
tion by Assistant Police Surgeon Thomp
son revealed that the unfortunate man's
skull was fractured. His neck is also uis
located, showing that he had been vio
lently thrown to the ground.
From cards found In his pockets las
name was ascertained to be Charles Mer
ritt Hawley. There was also a marriage
contract discovered in his clothes, wnich
read as foil lows:
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 6. IS9S.
To Whom It May Concern: This is to cer
tify that we, Charles M. Hawley and Alma
E. Burton, have taken each other for hus
band and wife for better or worseâ to live
together in sickness, in health and In pov
erty or wealth, until death doth part us.
Be it understood that we are such from this
day, Sunday, November 6, 1898. Signed,
Charles M. Hawley and Alma E. Burton.
The contract was in a woman's hand
â¢ writing, and was evidently written by
.Miss Burton.
On a piece of paper was scrawled the
following: "Good night, laddie, and may
God ' bless you is the prayer of your
sweetheart. I do love you, you dear,
brave boy. I am proud of you. Look to
Jesus, darling, and you will be happy."
The message was not signed, but from a
comparison of the hand-writing with that
of the marriage contract it was evidently
written by Hawley's contract wife.
â  There was also a memorandum book
found in one of Hawley's pockets, con
taining the names of his family and fe
. male acquaintances. On one page was
the following:
"Left home Friday, October, 1889. Ar
rived in Cripple Creek February 23, 1895;
left Cripple Creek March 31, 1897. Ar
rived San Francisco October 14, 1897; left
for Honolulu September 7, 189 S. Returned
to San Francisco October 7, 1898. Left for
â¢ Oregon November 2, 1895." On one of the
cards was written the address, "The Co
â¢ lonial, Berkeley, Cal."
Immediately after the police were noti
fied that the man was dying, Sergeant
' Martin and Policemen Fennell and Hurd
proceeded to make an investigation. Aft
er considerable trouble they found two
boys who claimed that they saw Hawley
staggering along Grant avenue. W hen
near Morton a man who had been follow
. ing Hawley walked up - behind Km and
struck him with his clenched fist.
As the man fell to the sidewalk his head
â¢ struck against the curbstone, rendering
him unconscious. His assailant at once
took to his heels and disappeared up I >
. Morton street. An habitue of the tender- |
â  loin, who is known as "Jack," informed |
the officers that Hawley fell down. He j '
watched him as he staggered along '
â¢ Grant avenue, and saw him topple over,
his head striking against the sidewalk. '
Hawley wore a hard hat, which was dent
â¢ ed in the back as if the wearer was struck
with some blunt instrument from behind.
" The surgeons at the hospital are satis- i
fiV-d that Hawley was assaulted with some '
blunt instrument, and as he fell uncon
scious' to the sidewalk his neck was dis
located. Captain Wittman had several
â¢. of his men scouring the tenderloin late
last night with a view of solving the mys
tery.
At midnight the unfortunate man was
In a dying condition and the surgeons at
._ the hospital expressed the belief that he
7 would not live many hours.
â¢ â¢ Proprietor Holman of "the Colonial" in
Berkeley, when seen last night, said that
â¢ he had a relative named Charles L. Haw
â¢ 'ley, who was supposed to be in the Fast.
' He did not think that the injured man
. was his relative, although his description
of the latter tallies exactly with that of
. the wounded Hawley. He also claimed
. â¢ that his relative had been recently mar
ried to a young woman named Miss Rey
nolds.

Is a parallel to the man who uses cof-
â¢. 'fee when In training.
The great trainers insist that their
' : men leave off coffee.
â¢ ' Why?
â¢ ; Experience teaches that the heart's
' ".action is weakened by coffee, even
when taken in small doses, and short-
ness of wind is due to a failure of the.
heart to furnish fresh blood to the
lungs fast enough.
Naturally the man who refuses to
throw off habits of this kind that crip-
ple his powers must stand aside for
the nervy ones that strip off the im-
pediments and train to win.
Why do trainers advise their men to
use Postum Cereal Food Coffee?
Because, while it looks like rich,
black Mocha and creams to the rich
golden brown of Java, it contains none
of the alkaloids of coffee; on the other
hand it is made of the selected parts
' of cereals (grains) that yield the albu-
men and phosphates needed by the hu-
man body to replenish the gray matter
in the nerve centers.
All who care to win in life s race need

extreme \ cruelty : "and ' desertion. â¢ Before

The De Hirsch Youths' Auxiliary
asked that it be permitted to present
itself to the Grand Lodge. The re
quest was granted, and at 2:30 p. m.
Colleague Michaels delivered an inter
esting essay on "Judaism," and Col
leagues Monash and Posener gave the
opening and closing addresses respec
tively.
A petition for a charter for a new
lodge to be instituted in this city was
read and referred to the committee on
state of the order. The petition con
tained forty-three signatures. The
committee on memorial set 8 p. m. as
an hour at which to report.
D. S. Hirshberg, a member of the
executive committee, read a communi
cation relative to the holding of tne
session of the Constitutional Grand
Lodge in this city in 1900. It set forth
that should the district insist upon the
holding of the convention in this city
the expense of transporting the many
delegates from the East would be so
great as to cause a deficit. The only
>-f -f O-f O + O-f O-f O-f O-fO-fO-fO + O-f O-f
Mrs. Swarzschild could ask. the court for
affirmative relief the husband caused the
suit to be dismissed. Mrs. Swarzschild
Immediately filed a complaint requesting
the court to dissolve their union on the
grounds of cruelty, desertion and failure
to provide. Bhe asked for alimony and
counsel fees.
Before summons could be served upon
Swarzschlld he packed his baggage and
left town. His whereabouts he concealed
carefully, and for a time it was un
known to Mrs. Swarzschild and her at
torneys, J. J. Greeley and J. D. Sullivan.
The latter trio were surprised early last
week when they were presented with a
summons and copy of a complaint filed
by Ferdinand Swarzschlld in the latter
part of last month in the District Court
of North Dakota, charging Mrs. Swarzs
child with extreme cruelty and desertion,
and praying for a separation on those
grounds. As Mrs. Swarzschild's suit is
still pending in the local courts a pretty
legal puzzle will probably result from
Swarzschild's efforts to get a divorce
from his wife and at the same time es
cape paying alimony and counsel fees
through a California court.
The Swarzschnds are well known in
this city and in Fruitvale, where they
made their home shortly after they were
married, some four years ago. Ferdinand
Swarzschild is reputed to be quite
wealthy, and to be the holder of vast in
terests in the Tesla coal mines.
Thai couples' troubles began early in
their married life, but they succeeded in
hiding their sorrows from the social cir
cles in which they moved. The rirst open
outbreak of hostilities occurred on June
10, when Swarzschlid, so his wife alleges,
refused to give her sufficient money to
buy wearing apparel, which she claimed
Bhe was sadly in need of. Burning words
were exchanged by husband and wife, and
Mrs. Swarzschild asserts that at the cli
max of the quarrel her husband struck
her. She left the house, and came to this
city and stayed for a time with her
mother.
"We do not expect Swarzschild to obtain
his end by bringing suit in North Da
kota," said J. J. Greeley, attorney for i.rs.
Swarzschild, when seen yesterday. "We
will simply set up a plea in bar on the
ground that an action of the same nature
instituted by Swarzschild in North Da
kota is still pending and undecided in the
Superior Court of this State, Our suit
means by which this deficiency might ||
be overcome would be by levying a +
special assessment on all the members O
in the United States. The consider*- +
tlon of the communication was made 9
a special order of business for 4 o'clock _
in the afternoon, and was settled by
ordering a reply sent expressing the q
determination of Grand Lodge No. 4 a
to secure the holding of the conven- o
tlon in San Francisco. Considerable a
discussion was had before a decision "T
could be reached. .a.
The reading of the officers' reports, o
all of which indicated progress, con- â â¦
sumed the time until 6 o'clock, when O
an adjournment was taken until 8 +
o'clock p. m. ?
At the evening session a memorial, o
written by Past Grand President â¢+
D. S. Hirshberg, was read by O
L. S. Solomon. The body then re- Â£
solved Itself Into a committee +
of the whole and considered mat- o
ters pertaining to the lodge. The +
Van Ness avenue committee reported O
that at present it would not advise a +
sale of the property of the lodge, but Â®
recommended that If ever it could be '
sold advantageously the Grand Lodge O
be called together in special session "*"
and consider the matter. O
The finance committee's report was +
made a special order for 3 o'clock to- O
day. The library committee recom- .4.
mended that $2000 per f.nnura be al- X
lowed for library expenses. a
An adjournment was then taken un- X
til 10 a. m. to-day. +

Her Young Husband May Encourage .

iaurope.
The Call's exclusive story which ap
peared last Friday telling of a prospect-;
ive wedding, with Charles F. Dwyer, the ;
noted plunger, and Mai Webber, the
fascinating brunette of this city, as the '
contracting: parties, which had its cul
mination in Milwaukee on Saturday, has
caused a small sized sensation among the
numerous friends of the now happy cou- ;
ple. There were many doubting Thomases â 
who, after reading the story in these col
umns, predicted that the marriage would
never take place, but when the telegrams
came announcing that Mai and . Charles
had been made one the dubious individ
uals were compelled to admit that they ,
were woefully wrong in their conclu
sions. The wedding was the universal
topic of conversation yesterday and con
gratulatory telegrams have been speed
ing . across the continent in unlimited
numbers to the young couple. , ; ..\
Among the friends of Mr. Dwyer In this
city the opinion was expressed that the
young turfman, for he is only 23 years â 
of age, had in all probability found his
affinity in the young lady, but they ap
peared to â be amused at his impetuous
step. They believe him to be sincere,
however, and see no reason why the mar
riage should not turn out a happy one.
The i bride and groom are young and in
telligent, and money will not be lacking
to purchase all the required comforts in |
addition to many luxuries.
It is ' not generally known that Mrs.
Dwyer, during her residence in San Fran
cisco, had theatrical aspirations and de
sired to shine as a star before the amuse
ment loving public. That was when she
was Mai Webber, and with that idea in
view she applied to S. H. Friedlander,
formerly manager of the Coiumbia Thea
ter, to help her realize her ambition. Ne
gotiations were entered into and arrange
ments were about completed for her ap
pearance on the legitimate stag?, but for
some reason or other the matter f oil
through. Now that the talented young
lady has plenty of money at her command
it Is possible that should she still enter
tain the same ambition to go before the
footlights, her indulgent husband may
encourage the whim, and a musical educa
tion in Europe is not a remote possi
bility. Mr. Frledlander, when seen last
""I remember Miss Mai Webber as a
dainty, prepossessing little lady, who
came to my office one morning and ap
plied for a position on the stage. She
stated that she had already studied for It
and had appeared in various amateur pro
ductions in the city and. elsewhere. She
showed herself to be possessed of a beau
tiful soprano voice and, -besides, consider
able talent. At my suggestion she joined
Cooper's Dramatic School in order to per
fect herself in her chosen art. and she
took part in various performances given
under the auspices of the school. .;.-.
"Finally Miss Webber made her debut
two years ago when living â â¢ pictures were
all the rage In San Francisco. She im
personated 8 the . character, of the â¢ tam
hmirine eirl" after a very famous French
nXunp at the California/ Her represen
tation of the character was so perfect and
realistic that we were compelled to show
the olcture nve or ten times; at every
performance. She was an immense draw-

E Bickel's Store Robbed.
The tailoring establishment of E. Blckel.
3559 Sixteenth street, was entered by
burglars eenrly yesterday morning and
over $200 in clothes carried away. An
entrance was effected by prying open the
fr T^o d men"iivin a g Ji^ y names of George
Smith and Charles Johnson were arrest

[ween Sixteenth and Seventeenth streets.
Officers Robinson and Rottanzi had locat
ed some of the cloth stolen from the
tailor shop and lay in wait. About 11
o^clock last night the two men drove up
in a buggy and while loading their plun
der into the vehicle were captured by the
officers after a sharp run up Seventeenth
street.
Purim Masquerade.
The annual Purim masquerade ball was
held last evening in Odd Fellows' Hail
under the auspices of the San Francisco
Hebrew Social Club. The hall was
crowded with friends and members of the
organization, nearly all of whom were in
costume. The gallery was crowded with
spectators. The success of the affair was
due to the efforts of the following com
mittee- H. Goldman, I. Brilliant. J. Gold

Falcon Island's Sudden End.
The latest budget of news from the
native kingdom of Tonga mentions the
disappearance of an island in the Pacific
under circumstances that seem to lend
some color to a popular superstition. On
October 13, 1885, the inhabitants of the
Tongan capital witnessed one of the
grandest natural pyrotechnlcal displays
of the century. Some thirty miles to the
northwest a submarine volcano suddenly
started operations, throwing columns of
steam and feathers of fire to an estimated
height of 12,000 feet. When the perform
ance was over and people thought it safe
enough to approach it w.is found that a
new Island, six miles long, two miles
broad and 300 f*Â»et high, had been added
to the map of the world. /It was chris
tened Falcon Island, but nobody cared to
settle on it. People who promenaded its
surface had a sensation akin to walking
on piecrust. Fragile and unsubstantial
as it was, it managed to live for exactly
thirteen years, finally sinking and disap
pearing from human view on October 13,
In this year of grace 1898. No matter what
the "Thirteen Club" may say, if that bold
body is still in existence, which we doubt.
there is something uncanny about that
particular number.â London Chronicle.
Railway Tickets Free for Voters.
French Deputies and Senators have the
privilege of traveling gratuitously, or
nearly so. on all the French railways, and
the idea has just occurred to M. Berton, a
genial Socialist Deputy, that the advan
tage of free railway traveling might, as
well as not, be extended to other citizens.
He has, consequently, proposed a law
whereby persons desirous "of taking part
in the elections and of manifesting their
will" shall be conveyed free of charge to
the constituency in which they are elec
tors. M. Berton says, in support of his
scheme, that the duty of a democracy Is
to facilitate the discharge by the citizens
of their civic duties. To this end the rail
way companies should be obliged by law
to enable commercial travelers and ner
sons working in other than their native
districts to return home almost gratui
tously at election times. The curious part
of this proposal is that, as it concerns at
a moderate estimate some 350,000 working
men, it is not at all unlikely that the
chamber will give it a favorable reception.

LIEUT. NEALL
IS ANOTHER
JEKYLL AID HYDE
Frequenter of Gam
bling Resorts.
WENT THE PACE THAT KILLS
PONIES, GAMINU AND LIQTJOiI
. WERE HIS RUIN.
His friends Think He Fled to the
Orient â Military Club Examin
ing the Fugitive Treai
urer's Accounts.
It is now generally thought by the army
officials of the department and by the offi
cers of the Presidio that Lieutenant John J
II. ; Neall. the absconding canteen officer, j
is safely out of the country. At lirst the j
thebry of suicide was suggested and en
tertained, but that is now considered im
. pmenta In this un
fortunate affair indicate that Lieutenant
N.eaJl. . in addition to living beyond his
. means, spent some of his time In the com- !
pany of women of questionable repute.
lie-was in the habit of coming to the city
: late at night. On these occasions he fre
.â¢ ifuented a number of gambling resorts,
-where the stakes were high an.d where
-women were permitted to p}ay.
It was in one of these places that the
â¢ lieutenant met Vivian Alcctt, who lives
.'on .Stockton street with Mrs. Laura RilL
>iiss Alcott, who is an unattractive
blonde, upon hearing of the trouble that
â  â¢had overtaken the army officer, began to
circulate a number of tales about Lieu
tenant Neail's relations with her. She
stated that he was deeply in love with
"her; that he gave her many presents and
that he wanted her to run away with him. j
The woman claims to know of the where
abouts of Lieutenant Neall, and says that
ehe lias in bank *700Q, which is at his dis- i
poaal. Not content with publishing to the
â world the shame and disgrace of one man,
â¢who has already placed himself beyond '
.tie pale of society, she mentions as a vis- [
ilor w^ch Lieutenant Neaii the name of a :
.-well-known ofticer of the Eighth Calif or- ;
â .'â rlia liegiment, who was stationed for a
'â¢While at the Pres<dio, and who w^s also
an Mntiiiiate friend of Lieutenant Neall.
â  Th* statements made by isiiss Alcott
are- to be accepted witu suspicion. Mrs.
Hill positively states that Lieutenant
Keall did not frequent her place, and
tha-t iliss Alcott was no more to him
than' any of the other inmates. She ad
inns tha.t Lieutenant Neall met the wom
an in a well-known gambling resort, and
that he was under the imiuence ot liquor
a.t the time.
These are the facts that came to light
yesterday in connection with the expos- :
ure of the dual existence that Lieutenant â¢
>"eail has been leading tor montias past, j
It is now generally conceded that it was j
the officer's ungovernable passion for the
card table ana the race course that
wrought his downfall.
The fact that Lieutenant Neail has dis- j
srracea the uniform is murtiiicauon |
enough for his brother officers and for j
his friends, but when it was learned that |
he had been unfaithful to his home ties |
the blow was even more severe to those
who had once been proud to number him
as a friend- Though Lieutenant Neall
led- a Jekyll and Hyde life, as a trusted
."official, his friends say he was not the
:morally bad man his enemies declare him
'to be, and they offer in extenuation the
â¢fact that he was always in his cups
â¢when he demeaned himself.
â¢ ' At a meeting- of the officers of the Pre
sidio .Club held late on Saturday evening
.Lieutenant William S. McNair was ap- j
"pointed temporary secretary and treas- I
. urer of the club. A committee of the of
ficers was appointed to make an exam
ination of the club's affairs for the pur
pose of determining Lieutenant Neall's
shortage. This will take several days.
The affaire of the organization are said
to have been balanced up to the begin
ning of the war. Since then the running ;
of the club has been almost entirely in i
Lieutenant Neall's hands. Whatever he
naay have stolen will of course be made
good, by the officers, so that the creditors
of the institution will lose nothing. It is
impossible to state at present how much
Lieutenant Neall took from the club, as
during .the time that the volunteers were
at the reservation it did a large cash
business.
The examination into the affairs of the
post canteen is to be completed to-day,
arid the board will make its report to Gen
eral Compton, commanding the Presidio,
â  who in turn will immediately acquaint
'the department commander with the re
â¢ Bulf of the investigation and the amount
of the .shortage.
The sentiment in Troop B, which was
.commanded by Lieutenant Neall, is still !
â one- of perfect loyalty to their disgraced
; officer. ' One of the troopers said yester
day :â¢â¢ "We loved the lieutenant, and there
;hv-not - a man in his troop who would not
ha.ye given up two months' pay willlngly
'tei'h'aye averted this sad happening."!
: -.Yesterday morning when the first ser- |
â .â geaht of the troop informed the men that
â¢'as a result of Lieutenant Neall's abscond
ing with the canteen funds the mess!
'would have to get along without its ex
tras, and that only Government rations ]
â srould be served, there was not a murmur.
The men of his troop all have only
â¢ thÂ§ kindest words to say of Lieutenant
JSeall. They do not seem able to realize
â what has befallen their commander, and
any one who should go among the men
end cast any aspersions on the name of
Lieutenant Neall would fare badly at
their hands.
There Is hardly any chance that Lieu
tenant Neall will be apprehended. It is
now thought that he took passage
for China or Australia. Those who know '
the man best express the belief that he j
will some day in the future make go-.-c! !
whatever his shortage may be. It is very j
apparent from what his brother officers j
have to say that none of them are at all i
anxious to see Lieutenant Neall brought i
back here to stand trial. If he were, of
course his sentence would be a dishonor
able dismissal from the army and a term
in the State penitentiary, for a court mar
tial has the same power in dealing- with
such a case as any civil court in the same
district.
ECCENTRIC HORATIO
PAUL PASSES AWAY
FELL FROM THE LOWEST RUNG
OF A LADDER.
He Is the Man Who Shot Manuel
Davie Over a Growler of
Beer.
Horatio Paul died at the Receiving Hos
pital this morning from a compound frac
ture of the right ankle, sustained about
two weeks ago through a slight fall from
a step ladder at his home in Temescal.
Paul was an eccentric character. He
had been frequently* in trouble. Several
months ago he shot Manuel Davie, a Por
tuguese, who lived on his premises, at
First avenue and Maple street. It was
stated at the time that Paul had asked
Davie for 10 cents, with w.hich to pur
cahse a "growler" of beer, and, being re
fused, he had shot Davie, one bullet en
tering the breast near the heart and the
other in the neck. Davie was recently dis
charged from the hospital, but is still suf
fering from the effects of the wounds.
Deceased was a native of England, aged
66 years, and a pioneer. He leaves a widow
and one daughter, Mrs. Hutchinson. re
elding at 9% Valencia street, San Fran
cisco. His sister is the wife of Percy Bee
mish. The funeral will be conducted un
der the auspices of the Society of Califor
nia Pioneers, of which deceased was a
member.

THREE DOG FIGHTERS CAPTURED IN A POLICE RAID.
DOG FIGHTERS
GATHERED IN
BY THE POLICE
Seventeen Sports "
Arrested.
ARE CAUGHT RED HANDED
I '
!
OFFICERS FIND THEIR GAME
IN A DINGY BASEMENT.
"Chalk" Casey, Leader of the Gang, (
Deplores the Fact That Canines
Get More Consideration
Than Bicycle Racers.
The police neglected the six-day racers
yesterday, but they raided a dog fight, j
! which, in the opinion of the _ public, is i
! quite as brutal a sport, even though rea- !
sonless dogs are the contestants.
Seventeen "sport" promoters, who re- ,
side along the line from Tar Flat to the
Barbary coast, and two â â  "bulls," a
i brindle and a white, trained until their
1 muscles and bones seemed about to burst i
j through the skin, were gathered in by j
the police and crowded into . the little |
boxes at the Seventeenth street police sta
tion.
The gang was fathered by "Chalk" 'â .
Casey, a recognized authority on dog ;
fighting, and John Baxter, the proud own- :
jer of the brindle dog. Andrew Shew-' :
bridge, who was, some five months ago,
mixed up in the killing of Tom Grady;
John gemming, who gave his name as
j James Williams, the dapper little book
I agent of Benhayon case fame, and a
host of similarly prominent luminaries
were among the captured, and, like the
man with the iron mask, bewailed their
fate. The captured dog fighters lined up
and gave the following names, many fie- ;
titious, and claimed the occupations set
forth: :
John Brown, hack driver; Dan Scullen,
shoemaker; Alex McVicker, Felix Des
mond, teamster; Henry Pare, laborer; ,
John O'Neil, plumber; Andrew Shew- ;
bridge, laborer; Chris Sverson, teamster;
James Casey, bartender; James Mack,
j laborer; John Baxter, horseshoer; John
Hogan, laborer; James Wilson, stevedore; ;
Thomas Smith, laborer; James Williams, I
blacksmith; Peter Menconi, laborer;
Frank Smith, teamster; John Wilson, j
hackman.
The match 30 rudely ended by the po
lice was arranged several days ago. The
basement under M. J. Meehan's grocery
store. Sixteenth and Church streets, was
secured for the battle, and the dogs put
on reduced rations. Three doors and a
! few planks were secured and a pit six by j
! ten feet erected in the basement and the
invitations to the event sent out.
This last move proved fatal to the suc
cess of the affair. An invitation fell into
the hands of a man who refuses to sane- |
tion either dog fighting or six-day bicycle
racing, and C. B. Holbrook, secretary of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty i
jto Animals, was notified. He communi- ;
I cated with Captain Gillen of the Seven- ,
I teenth street Police Station, and. Detec- j
tives Robert Graham and John Fitz-
I gerald were put on the case. It was
worked up nicely by them, and yester- :
day a squad of policemen, appointed to j
raid the "game," assembled under the
command of Sergeant Campbell. Besides :
the sergeant and detectives mentioned, I
Officers James Belyea, H. L. Folsom, M. â 
S. Cooney, A. Fracy and Con Hlehl of ;
the regular police, Mr. Holbrook and his â 
officers, Hooper, McCurrie and Walton,
made up the squad. â¢ '.â ; \<i^.:''-^r â â 'â  â *.â 
At 6 o'clock the advance was ordered.
j A rush was made and the basement doors '
were burst in just as the ferocious look- i
ing dogs v.-ere being dragged into the pit
by their handlers.
It was useless to resist, and the sur
! prised and sorrowful dog fighters were
: bundled into the patrol wagon and hur- I
ried off to Jail. Subsequently the sports
and- dogs, now tagged as exhibits for
evidence, were jaunted off to the : City
Prison to await bail.
"Chalk" Casey remarked when he
reached the City Prison:
"There will be dog fighting as long as
there are dogs," he said, "and although
I've done time for promoting a scrap I
won't squeal, but will do time again if
necessary. But it's funny how the ladies
like six-day races and how the law mak
ers hate dog fighters."

Dogma of Infallibility.
"Infallibility a Hurtful Dogma" was the
subject of the Rev. A. J. Wells' sermon at
the Second Unitarian Church last even
ing. He argued that where there was su
perstition there was always friction In re
ligion and he believed that to accept in
fallibility was nothing less than supersti
tion. "We should take the holy Bible,"
he said, "and read it to form our own con
victions."

THE SAJST FRANCISCO CALL, aiONPAY. FEBRUARY 20, 1899.
NON-WINNERS'
STAKE GOES TO
REST ASSURED
Beats Fast Entries at
Ingleside.
MOTTO WAS THE RUNNER-UP
GRAND OLD F^AR NOT MAKES A
SPLENDID SHOWING.
Short-Enciers Rsap a Harvest and Cxo
Home Jubilant â A Fine Card
Is Run Oft Before
Thousands.
Coursing enthusiasts are beginning to
believe that "Biliy" McGiven, the popu
lar handier of Bartels Bros.' kennels,
uses a magic lotion to anoint his dogs
and bitches. Last Sunday Mac's Melody
took the open stake without turning a
hair, and yesterday Kest Assured, a
handsome brown bitch belonging to the â 
same kennel, captured the non- winners' \
; btake in tine style.
Next to the victory of Rest Assured the
j work of the grand old dog Fear Not was
! the most interesting feature of the day's
sport. The winner of the John Grace cup
: three years ago at Newark had some of !
j the hardest courses of the day, but by
pure grit and speedy work he landed
; third money. In the opinion of many
i Fear Not might have won the stake but
.for an over-hard course with Petronius,
and again, had not the "jack" in his
course with Rest Assured turned from
him, as the points scored by the rivals
before the kill were about even. The run
; ning of Motto, F. A. McComb's bitch, was
remarkable. The Santa Clara candidate
had some gruelling courses, but succeeueu
â  in going tnrough the stake to v-.e iUiai
when he was put out by Rest Assured.
Thousands of lovers of coursing took
: advantage of the delightful weather and
journe>ed to the favorite park to enjoy
the exciting sport. The betting ring was
i crowded throughout the day. "Shortend
\ ers" were in their glory, landing often
and pocketing their winnings with satis
fied smiles. The following dogs brought
them good fortune: Kerry Gow beat Mag
; net at 3 to 5; Black Bess beat Sunburst
iat 3 to 5; Fireball beat Maid of Bail,
| 3 to 5; Lady Emma beat Dawn, 4 to 5;
' : Beauty beat Star Pointer, 3 to 5; Motto
I beat Cavalier, 3 to 5; Grasshopper beat
i Fox Kenny after a "no-go" at 3 to 5;
Miss Alice beat Matchless at 4 to 5; Bell
Seward beat Terrona, 3 to 5; 'Pastime beat
Precita Girl at 2 to 5; Mysuc beat Vanity
after a "no-go" at 2 to 5; *'ear Not beat
Hicks, 3Vz to a; Miss Alice beat Sylvanus,
3 to 5; Petronius beat Forget, 3M: to 5-
Fear Not beat Petronius at 2% to 5, and
Motto beat Maid of Bail in a bye at 2
to 5.
The manner in which the "jacks" ran
I yesterday was largely due to their hand
ling by Harry Murry. At this time last
year spectators were satisfied with a run
i up and a kill, but yesterday the hares
'. gave the dogs plenty of exercise betore
â¢ being dispatched.
Owing to the great card to be run off
â  on Washington's birthday, on Wednesday
next, there will be no try-outs at Ingloslde
' to-day. It has been the usual custom of
; the management of the park to allow
j owners and trainers to exercise their sap
lings there, but the privilege will be with
; held until next Monday.

Supreme Need of the Hour.
At the Howard-street M. E. Church last
evening Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson
preached on "The Supreme Need of the
Hour." He said in part:
"Much of our dealing with the prob
lems of evil which confront us is surface
dealing. We try to remedy this defect
and that defect of an intrinsically evil
condition. We build one Christmas tree
reformation and are surprised a little
later to find that the frutt Is gone and
there Is no life in the tree to produce
more.
"A few years ago the greatest minister
in the United States turned the busy mind
of New York toward the absolute neces
sity of municipal reform, and he led the
greatest city of our country to victory,
and Tammany was overthrown. But be
fore the smoke of battle had cleared away
the reformation was captured by a set of
politicians not less vile, though less ex
perienced, than those who had been over
thrown. And by their vile collusion Tam
many Hall in three years was again on
the throne with a longer lease of power
than ever.
"The trouble is that we don't plow deep
enough. We doctor symptoms when it is
the cause of the symptoms that must be
dealt with. The present condition of
government and the state of society in
this and all other cities represents fairly
well the average moral or immoral condi
tions of Its citizenship. We must get at
the regeneration of the individual as the
supreme necessity of the hour. Every
thing else but postpones without curing.
This only is permanent. Except a man
be born aguin ho cannot enter the king
dom of God. The principles of the king
dom of God are the supreme need of so
ciety to-day. And they ran be by the new
birth fuipefnnturally imparted to every
human soul."

â¢:â¢â . WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â fol
lowing 'statement from the War De
. partment on pending army legislation
and the needs of the service was issued
tcf-day with a request for Its publica
: tlon: .
On Monday the Senate will take up
.what is now conceded to be the most im-
Ipbrtant subject before Congressâ the reor
ganization of the regular army. The Mili
.â¢'.,tary Committee has submitted two bills
for Its consideration. One of these, the
: House (known as the Hull) bill, is report
ed with but few amendments, by its
tnalrman. Senator Hawley. an expert in
matters relating to military organization.
. It has been perfected by the committee,
.including the Democratic members, in
several particulars; the most noteworthy
'."â¢and valuable being, perhaps, the provision
'.' increasing the corps of cadets by 100 and
insuring an adequate source of supply for
.-.vacant second lieutenancies. The meas
..UFe- preserves the present organization
.and/slightly strengthens the cavalry, aug
ments the artillery and organizes that
â¢.arm on a scientific basis suited to our con
.dltioris; gives to the Infantry the much
â¢â  needed three-battalion organization, and
make* only such additions to the staff as
-.'axe - absolutely indispensable. Under its
â¢ provisions entrance to any branch of the
army can be obtained only after the can
didate for a commission has demonstrated
"his fitn-es for it to the satisfaction of a i
â¢competent examining board. There is a
â¢"clause empowering i.ie President to ex
â tend or contract the enlisted strength ac
cording to the necessities of the country, I
" providing for the first time a scheme j
-.adopted long since for all modern Euro- i
â pe?n' military systems.
' The other bill is brought forward by
â¢.Senator Cockrell. Its first section directs j
â¢ 'the- dlsbandment of the volunteer army
â¢'"Within a specified period after the peace I
"treaty shall have been ratified by Spain. j
.'Sections 2 and 3 contain its principal pro- ;
vjslons. By the former, authority is con- j
.feared for continuing the regular army at ;
.Its war strength until July 1, 1901. while ,
ti*fe third section authorizes the President - r
â jo' raise the military forces to the number ,
-â¢of 000 in Cuba, Porto Rico and the is- ;
â¢ lands of the Pacific, to be known respec- <
â¢ti.vely as the Army of Cuba, the Army of I
.â¢3?oJtb Rico and tho Army of the Islands :
of the Pacific, to be composed of the in- ;
-habitaxkte of such islands. No organiza
l.tton is provided in the bil for this force, i
' nor does it determine what relation it
â¢Sh'ajl sustain toward the permanent mill- i
â¢ tarv establishment of the United States
and -t>o professional, educational, or other I
*est is prescriDed for the persons who are
."to "officer it. The bill does not provide for
â .;any additional general officers greatly
seecled In the administration of affairs in .
.'=C'i-ba. Porto Rico and the Philippine. It
.-.would Leave the army as now organized. .
â  yflth but three major generals and six
: -brigadier generals, which allows but one
â¢.â ceneral officer for each of the military ;
aepartments In the United States and one
for- â  anting general of the army. ;
â¢ . Cuba now constitutes a miUtlary Qivi- ;
:sion commanded by a major general, and, ,
moreover, comprises six milittary depart
menta commanded by general officers of i
eers. In Porto Rico there is a
necessity for at least one general' officer
and in the Philippines for the general of- \
fleers required for an army corps, so that ,
â¢If Senator Cockrell's bill should become;
"a law it would leave the army deficient
nor only in enlisted force, but without any
general officers to administer the impor
i tant duties now devolving upon the Gnv- ,
'err.ment. Moreover, the bill fails to make
any provision for the increase in the gen
'eTal staff, which is urgently called for
. by the necessities of the situation in our ;
new possessions.
â¢ The criticism that has been passed upon i
the" department has been the absence of
sufficiently trained staff officers. The |
t'ockrell â¢ amendment would perpetuate l
this alleged lameness. Should his bill be |
â¢passed into law, the adjutant, inspector,
' quartermaster, subsistence, medical and i
pa>*' departments would be left with only
1 rho bare skeleton of the staff organiza
tions that we have had for the adminis
tering of affairs in the United States
alone, previous to the declaration of war
â¢with Spain. The returns of the War De
.partnier.t show the strength of the reg
' ular arm-, at this time, to be only a few
â¢/Jess than r.0,000 enlisted men. Of these
-'nearly 14;000 are in Cuba and a like num
ber in or en route to the Philippines, and
In PoTto Rico 1686, leaving the total en
. Jistc-d men of the regular army in the
' -United States 24.000. Of these 6000 are
â  /held .in readiness for dispatch to re
â  "ir-fnrce the army at Manila. This would
.". Joave the total enlisted strength of the
' .hrrhy" within the United States less than ,
â¢Il?;000, or nearly 4000 less than is neoes
â¢Vsary to furnish a single relief to man the ;
.^uns -now on our seacoast fortifications. !
'!?â  'would compel the abandonment of all
\ [oyir p.osts in the Interior, would strip the
: .'lndian country of troops and leave none
â¢ to- supply the" requirement of an exigent i
.--Condition.
"' The- Hawley bill fixes the permanent
â¢mi.iitary. establishment at the minimum
â¢â -of 50.000, a force that in proportion to j
..â population and wealth of country is less
. 'ban fixed by any other act of Congress. ,
'â 'At this time there is not an officer on
â¢ -duty.. -with any college in the United 1
.States, notwithstanding the law con
â¢.Jempfates that there shall be a hundred
'.detailed for the Instruction of the young
â tÃ"en of the country, but the absence of
- officers from their regiments by reason of
' Wounds and sickness, and" of the ne
cessity of the service In connection with i
" the muster-out of volunteer regiments,
compelled the department to withdraw
.instructors from these educational insti
tutions. Neither has it been able to at- i
tach officers to our embassies and lega
tions'abroad. There should be one at
â¢? very-: European capital; there are now but
â  three-'. ln all, and those who were recalled
'to participate In the war cannot be re
' turned. . The passage of the Hawley bill
â¢would. enable the department to meet this
urgent requirement and also to re-estab
lish the schools at Fort Leavenworth and
' the artillery school at Fort Riley, all of
.".which are now closed for the want of of
ficers'. The passage of the Cockrell bill
wo/uld discharge at once all the volunteer
â  quartermasters, medical officers and com
..missaries. among whom are officers of
â¢- the . .regular army holding volunteer:
"commissions, and would leave the depart- ",
ment with a corps of officers wholly In
- adequate with the increased demands that
are Doing made from every quarter. The
' bill reported by Senator Hawley provides
â¢biily 'lor the absolute neeas of the ser
.vice, on lines of efficiency and economy.
â¢ It was at the instance .of Mr. Hull pre
' pared under the supervision of the adju
tant general of the army, of General
â¢ Schwan. Colonel Carter, Majors Heist and
â¢ Johnston and Simpson, officers of long
Eeivice and high ability. The passage of
Â° the -Hawley bill would give promotion to
"'"officers that have earned it by the hard-
' est kind of frontier and battle service.
- Otherwise our gallant officers must go
without reward beyond a sense of duty
well done. _ _
â  The natives of Cuba. Porto Rico and
trie Philippines do not understand our pur
poses and ways of government sufficiently
to admit of their being made part of our
military establishment to the extent of
â¢organizing them into companies, battal
ions and regiments at once. Our officers
of greatest experience with mem are of
.this opinion. In time this could doubt
less be done, but it will require education.
' J3v degrees a company could be given to
'a' regiment to be utilized as scouts and
guides; further on a battalion could be
! added, and In time, things working well,
." raiments could be. organized; but it will
take time, so much time, that for the uses
of the Immediate present and some time in
"the future, they could not be wisely
"counted as affording any considerable
eXrength to the service, however many

TO FORMULATE LAWS
FOR THE ANTILLES
National Commission About to De
part for Cuba and Porto
Rico.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The commis
sion named by the President to consider
questions pertaining to the civil affairs in
Cuba and Porto Rico is busily engaged in
completing preparations to leave for the
islands, the purpose being to sail late next
week or early in the following week.
! Henry C. Curtis, a member of the com
j mission, has not arrived from lowa, but
; General Kennedy and Charles W. Watson,
I the other members, are proceeding with
! the work. The chief questions before
them are those of taxation, public schools,
public highways and franchises for pri
vate enterprises.
At present no personal or realty taxes
are being collected in either island, the
former laws having been suspended. With
a view to preparing and recommending a
desirable system for property taxation
: the commission is making a complete com
i pilation of the tax laws of the several
i States, to the effect that the bestrnay be
i given Cuba and Porto Rico. The plan
will be agreed upon after the members of
the commission have visited the islands,
and personally given the conditions thor
, ough study. . , .
The questions of public schools and
highways will receive early attention, but
I it will be necessary to give more imme
diate attention to the applications for
franchises which have accumulated in
a great mass through the YV ar D.e
partment. All applications for fran
chises of a quasi public nature are
' referred by the department to the com
mission and the latter must pass upon
them. To date the capital represented by
the applications on file aggregates $80,.oj.
--000. among the applications being one for
the construction of a railway from the
eastern to the western end of Cuba, a dis
ta-?^Â°co6m^ssion has not determined
upon its itinerary, but it probably will go
first to Cuba. _

NEW YORK, Feb. 19.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The adminis- '
tration is unwilling to grant a cable con
cession across the Pacific without express
authority from Congress, but Is making
all necessary preparations for the estab
lishment of a line either by Government ;
or by private enterprise. The Nero, which
has been used as a collier, will leave San
Francisco the latter part of next month
to make surveys for the line. As all the ,
necessary surveys have been made be
tween San Francisco and Honolulu the
main work will be between Hawaii, Guam â

THIS SAJV FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1899.
WASHINGTON
AS A CHRISTIAN
AND A SOLDIER
Ministers Glorify His
Memory.
PICTURE HIM AS A MODEL
REV. H. T. SHEPARD'S LESSON
FROM HIS LIFE.
Lays Stress on the Absolute Truth
- fulness and Uprightness of the
First President of the
Republic.
The Rev. Dr. H. T. Shepard, pastor of
the Olivet Congregational Church, at
Seventeenth and Noe streets, took the life
of George Washington for the subject of
his sermon last evening.
"We shall commemorate Washington's
birthday next Wednesday," he said. "To
day let us study his life and find out how
he became so great. Washington, in the
first place, was raised by God-fearing par
ents, who when he was yet almost an in- j
fant taught him the Lord's Prayer and
Biblical texts, and as he grew older they
further directed him in the right way, so
that his conscience would be sensitive to
right and wrong doing.
"It was noticeable that as a boy every- I
thing he undertook he did with all his
might, and that even at his studies he
never wasted his time, but recognized the
advantage of obtaining a good education.
When Washington was 16 he started out
In life as a surveyor. . His strong person
ality and ability caused other men with
whom he came in contact to respect him,
and he was looked upon as a leader by
them.
"Lord Fairfax, who was sent over to
America as a high official by King George
111, reposed the greatest confidence
in Washington, and early in his career
predicted that Washington would be a
man among men. We all know how Wash
ington became the first President of the
United States, and how he was both pat
riotic and Christianlike. He was a lover
first of God and secondly of his country.
"Let us take Washington as a model to
copy from him, and in our lives recognize
we can never be successful except by
God's help and guidance."
Rev. Frederick C. Lee's Sermon.
Rev. Frederick C. Lee, pastor of thÂ«
California-street M. E. Church, preached
a stirring sermon on the life of Washing
ton last night. The church was crowded.
"You will admit," he said, "that Wash
ington was the greatest soldier-statesman
that ever lived. He was known as a man
of few words, but that every word that
was spoken by him was not delivered un
til it had been given due consideration and
would carry its weight with it and would
be true. -Let us at all times speak the
truth, no matter what it costs us. And
let us lead a life like George Washing
ton's so that when we are called away
we may leave behind us a memory that
will be respected as much as his.'

FANG AND
BALD MADE
GOOD RECORDS
Olympic Club Crack
Redeemed Himself.
THE CYCLER DID LIKEWISE
GOOD MARKSMANSHIP IN THE
BROILING SUN.
Birds by the Score Fell Under the
Gunners' Aim, but a Few Score
Also Escaped Without
Damage.
Members of the Olympic Gun Club "en-
Joyed" a live bird shoot in the broiling
sun yesterday. Although the heat was
deprecated and tha sun's raya criticized,
both came in handy. Poor shots said the
shimmering of the sun's rays on the
| gleaming barrels was responsible for their
i ill luck; experts took pride in referring
to their records for the same reason. Jack
Fanning redeemed himself and bested
all opponents. Eddie Bald, the famous
I cycler, also added to his fame. He crept
I into the money once or twice, and then
: pronounced shooting the most sporty
: sport extant.
In the first six bird match Ed Fay pot
i 5 birds, Fanning 5, Games 5 and Kitttle
i man 4. In this match it will be noticed
that Games stood even with the "cracks,"
but in subsequent events he fell down
j hard. Both barrels would jjo off at once,
! he would get a second biro on a snap or
; the first barrel, but the birS invariably se
cured its liberty without material dam
age.
In the second match, one of twelve
i birds, Fanning made a clean record,
killing his dozen "clean," but not witnout
using a second barrel on seven occasions.
Unlucky Games secured but 5, while Bald,
who entered this match, got 6; a lair
record for Bald, but he did even better
:in the next contest. Kitttleman landed 6,
and Nauman landed close to the money
; with 10 to his credit.
Although Bald only winged 8 birds out
' of his 12 in the next match, this was great
work for him and he was jubilant. He
promises to kill all with his first barrel
next Sunday, and, as he made the promise
i after killing 7 birds straight, many are
j inclined to believe him, although a lew
! are doubtful. In this match Fanning got
i 11, Nauman 11. Golcher 9 and Games 9.
In the next six bird match Fanning killed
6 Nauman 6, Golcher 6, Kittleman 4 and
dames, with usual luck, 3.
Games and Kittleman tnen shot for the
championship, others not participating.
Kittleman got 5. The record was not plain
regarding Games' score, but in any event
he paid Kittleman $10 and quit shooting.
Games says another Sunday is coming,
however, ahd Games had better practice
on all opportunities between now and
'. then. ,
"MEMBERSHIP DAY."
Dr. Locke Inveighs Against Brutal
Bicycle Races.
Yesterday was celebrated as "Member
ship day" at the Central Methodist Epis
copal Church, of which Dr. Charles Ed
ward Locke is pastor. The special evan
gelistic meetings which have been held
in this church for the last two weeks
culminated in a service of great beauty
and impressiveness. The rite of baptism
was administered to children, after which
a class of twenty persons was received
into full membership.
When the invitation was cordially ex
tended by Dr. Locke for people to join
Central Church eighty persons crowded
around the chancel and gave their names
to the pastor.
Last evening in his sermen Dr. Locke
indulged in some sharp words of denun
ciation concerning the six-day bicycle
race In the Mechanics' Pavilion.
"Since last Monday evening," he said,
"a company of young men have been sub
jecting themselves to a test of physical
endurance which, in all the record of bi
cycle riding on this coast, is unprecedent
ed in barbarism and- inhumanity. The
contestants have ridden their wheels con
tinually, only stopping to rest when,
from sheer exhaustion, they fall or are
taken from their machines. When they
are nearly overcome with sleep tin cans
are mercilessly beaten in their ears and
every expediency is resorted to to keep
them in the race.
"As the race nears the end it is reported
that many of the competitors are suffer
ing from delirium, because of this ter
rific mental as well as physical strain,
and it is certain that many of these poor
fellows will not for a long time, and, per
haps, never, recover from this frightful
tax upon their nervous systems.
"Some sporting men about the city
have been heard to denounce this bicycle
race because of the atrocity of this heart
less and inhuman contest. I am told
that pool-rooms about the track are
crowded with those who are gambling on
the race. Is it not exasperating that
there is not such a mighty protest of pub
lic opinion as to make such public spec
tacles an impossibility? And, behold,
too, this abomination of Sabbath break
ing. All through this holy day and this
evening a wild throng has made and
is making the Pavilion a gateway of hell.
God have mercy upon these wicked
multitudes who are transgressing the
holy day into a carnival of godlessness.
"Fellow citizens, cancers of Immorali
ty are eating their foul craters into our
body politic. It is time for us to protest
with loud earnestness, and. In the namo
of the home, of good order, of the Statp
and church, Inaugurate a crusade against
coarse and profane desecrators. Let us
demand the passage and enforcement of
such laws as to make these cruel exhibi
tions impossible."
Ancient Order Foresters.
Court Apollo will give its sixth grand
entertainment and ball in Union Square
Hall on the 22d inst.
The board or deputies has organized a
team for initiatory work. The board has
also organized the 1900 Club, which will
receive the delegates to the Subsidiary
High Court in that year.
During the past week the high chief
ranger visited Courts Violet, Concord,
Ivanhde and Piedmont. In each place he
was pleased with the interest show in the
order and in several of the courts can
ciidates were initiated. On the 18th he will
visit Court Volta and on the 23d he will
be with Court Grant in East Oakland.
Last Thursday night Permament Secre
tary Falconer visited the court at San
Pablo, where he initiated ten candidates.
Hermann's Sons.
The masquerade ball that was given
last week in Eintracht Hall under the
auspices of the united lodges of the OV
der of Henmann's Sons was one of tne
most successful affairs that has ever been
given under the direction of that order.
The attendance was unusually large, the
costumes were varied, many original an
a great number very attractive. Oscar
Hochs personated Prince Carnival and
Mrs. May Goebbels personated Princess
Carnival, and followed J. Hohn, t c floor
manager, and F. Micheelsen, chairman
of the committee of arrangements, who
lied the grand march. There were about
three hundred couples in the march, and
the procession as it moved in the various
turns around the hall to the music of a
military band was a pretty spectacle.

ONLY THREE
WEEKS BEFORE
THE BUTTLE
Oakland Desires No
Extremist.
CAMPAIGN OF PERSONALITY
SNOW HAS OUTLINED HIS PLAT- i
FORM.
Questionable Practices Have Not
Benefited the Water Monopoly.
Cranks Are Not to Be
Countenanced.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Feb. 19.
Three weeks i>cm the day this article
"Is published a new government is to be
elected for this city. These weeks will be
busy ones, for it is pretty well acknowl
edged that no candidate for office is to
bo accepted at his self-appraised face
value: The keynote of the campaign was*
fittingly voiced by Hon. Giles H. Gray at
the meeting of the Municipal League
Thursday night. "This is not a campaign
cf parties," he said, "but a campaign for
gooC government. No national principles
. are involved, and no man is violating his
party fealty, whatever it may be, by act
ing in a non-partisan capacity in this
campaign."
It is a campaign of scrutiny and per
eonal worth is the basis of vote-getting.
A practical wave seems to have swept
. over the voters, and no one appears to
cure whether a man is an imperialist or I
a socialist, so long as he possesses the
Intelligence, ability and manhood neces
sary to serve in a public capacity. The
people are not basing their opinions on
a man's previous stand politically; they
, are examining his past life, his standing
with his creditors, his standing socially,
and even his family relations in order to
ascertain whether those who are candi
dates are possessed of the moral stam
ina that will insure honesty and economy
in the government of Oakland.
At the same time there is no desire for
extremists. People do not want "corpo
ration" men or "anti-corporation" men.
They do not desire prohibitionists or
free-saloon license advocates. They do
not desire injudicious penuriousness nor
luxurious wastefulness. They do not de-
Blre high tax advocates nor "cheap" men. |
In a word, there is a desire for intelli
gent men of fair, broad views, who can
follow a policy to the end without being j
swerved to one side or the other or i
turned backward. Auditor Snow clever
:â  \;>ressed this sentiment a few nights
ago when he said thiu although economy
must be not only a sentiment but a prac
tice in successful city government, still
it is false economy to have a "cheap" j
government. Mr. Snow explained his i
statement by declaring that a city can
not stand still, but must retrograde or
â¢progress. It is not sufficient to raise
just enough revenue on which to run a
city and not to have any for permanent !
improvements, any more than it is com
mendable to fix a tax so high as to leave
a large surplus to be squandered in the
interests of any body or influence which
'may secure a pull on city officials.
The fact that voters have been so gener
ously supiilied -"-.ih political oratory in
the past is recognized by candidates who
are all desirous of keeping off the public
platform as much as possible and of mak
ing personal campaigns. Probably not for i
another week will a public demonstration
be made by any party, and it would be ab
solutely Impossible to bring out large au- (
diences night after night to listen to the :
same plalitud-s that have been spread
broadcast for years. This is not a cam- \
paign of platforms or promises. All the j
parties have formulated model docu
ments, any one of which if sincerely car
ried out would give to Oakland all that j
any pessimist could desire in the way of
beneficial government. But it is well
known that much that is promised would
not be carried out by those who have
â¢pledged themselves, and therefore the
s<ai\h is being made for those who can be
depended upon to carry out their pledges,
no matter what their views may be on
national political questions.
Mr. Snow has already given an outline j
of what might be called the basis of his ,
campaign, and it is evident that the tax
levy is to be the main point of dispute be
tween the two men seeking the office of
Mayor.
John L. Davle has always maintained
that a dollar tax is ample upon which to
run the city. Mr. Snow has declared that
when he as Auditor in l!>S9 had the power
to dominate the tax levy he fixed it at $1,
ran the o<--- government successfully and |
turned over a large surplus into the next j
fiscal year. Mr. Davle has not yet made i
his lirst speech in this campaign, but will j
do so toward the end of this week. It is !
â aid that he is working very carefully on :
his subjects so as to be able to present
without any element of doubt his exact |
position on matters municipal. After he j
has flone this, the line will be tightly ;
drawn and for the following two weeks I
the battle must necessarily be very bitter,
and to a large extent personal. U hile
â¢ the records of candidates as public offi
cials wfll up brought up, it is realized that
the first camp to indulge in epithets and
what is known as mud-sllnging will be at
a disadvantage, for Oakland voters have j
been mo well trained In politics during the
nasi ten years to be deceived by the usual i
tactics of politicians.
After listening to the speech of Mr. |
"Watkinson. manager for the Contra j
Costa Company, before the City Coun- {
ell, I am inclined to think that even in
local politics honesty is the best policy.
With all its manipulating and its pur
' chasing of manhood during the past
twenty years, this corporation has not
â¢ received what is due to it under the law.
It has been in existence thirty-three
years and Just one-half of this period it j
has not paid dividends. The law entitles
it to a reasonable rate of interest on the
value of its plant, and it has not received |
it. The reason is very plain, it has stood
in its own way of being fairly treated. <
Just how it made Its initial entrance into j
politics and commenced to debauch Coun- '
cils and city officials matters not. Such j
an entrance into illegitimate business was
made, and the company has suffered ap- |
parently as much as the people. Year!
after year the company's officials go be- i
fore the Council and are listened to re- I
speetfully as individuals as they tell
about the costs and present value of their
plant, but at the same time the man post
ed on public affairs is smiling tip his
sleeve at the figures presented, knowing
full well that they are not correct; that
they are based on fancy, and that only
the original books which went out of ex
istence with Anthony Ohabot could throw
a clear light on the subject. Had the
company followed throughout an honest j
policy of dealing squarely with the peo
ple year after year and not have brought
suspicion and worse on itself by its many
attempts to secure a benefit unearned, at
the expense of the people, it would cer
tainly have fared better. Many men who
have sat In the Council, I doubt not,
have been actually forced, against their
judgment, to favor a water-rate ordi
nance below a legitimate figure to pro
tect themselves from the inevitable
charge which would otherwise be made of
being bbught by the corporation. There
is no reason why the Contra Costa Com
pany and the city of Oakland should not
deal as harmoniously and as squarely
with each other as any other two parties
to a contract.
It is surely not beyond the limit of pos
sibility in these days of commercial man
agement that a city like Oakland can
not be supplied with water without there
being not only suspicion but positivie evi
dence of the existence of crookedness. If
there be any merit in the company's con
tention thai it has not received its just
due from thlÃ city for seventeen years
of its existence, it is probably balanced
by the fact, although the company does
not admit it, that for the other fifteen
years it has received more than its due.
Oakland pfcduces more queer stories than
any other tov*n of its size in the world. Where
else, outside or Utah, has a man ever com
mitted bigamy by marrying two Bisters, the
second Bister havin* full Knowledge ot the
first marriage?-Edltorial Squib from ban
Francisco Newspaper.
This statement Is perfectly true, but the
incident with which It Is sought to bear it
out is perhaps one of the least queer of
the many that this city furnishes. In pol
itics queer incidents predominate. Where
else in the world in a city either larger or |
smaller than Oakland would men be elect- j
ed to office after having once proved their
unfitness as officials and their unfaithful
ness as men? Yet in Oakland men known j
to be wholly untrustworthy have been re- ;
turned to "the Council term after term, .
and at this hour there is one man. proof
of whose perfidy is actually on record
who aspires to succeed himself In that
honorable body. This is certainly a freak
Where else but in Oakland would people j
give a bonus of $10,000 toward building a i
handsome theater, and then make a prac- â ,
tlce of crossing the bay to see the plays? j
Where else can so many definitions of
murder be found, or so many manslayers
be seen at "large?
Where else does there exist a valuable
water front that has done nothing toward
building up a city during nearly half a
century in which the population of that
city has grown from nothing to neariy j
lO liigÂ° pumpkins, double-headed goats, fat |
women and skeleton men have not the j
least chance of starring in a (lime muse- ,
urn in this city, bring altogether insignifi
cant when compared with the nueer inci
dents that are daily seen in our courts,
government and on our streets. And just
as I am writing comes a report that a
jealous Oakland wife has poured carbolic
acid on her sleeping husband s eyes and
destroyed his slgnt.
These remarks about freaks have a lit- j
tie' lnterest just at this time. It does a!
city no good to be regarded as a stamping ;
ground for freaks, and Oakland has more
than her share. A few months ago a city
nfflriil Â«tated at a public meeting that
there Ur! cranks in other cities, but that
God has been unduly f enerous in the mat
ter of cranks toward Oakland. I don t
the* thinking people. Three weeks from i
now they will have an opportunity of lay- ;
ing the foundation for at least two years
of progress and dignity. The Intelligent
iikp of a little red stamp in the ballot
booth wfll do more to stamp out cranks
crooks and freaks than any amount of
lecturing or BOOTH.
STUDENT FINANCES
ARE UNSATISFACTORY
APPEAL TO BE MADE TO THE
BOARD OF REGENTS.
They Will Be AskÂ«d to Impose a
Students' Expense Fee Upon All
Entrants to the University.
BERKELEY, Feb. 19.-The Constitu
tional Committee of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of California is
about to attempt a radical change in stu
dent finances. The move held to be
necessary because of the very irregular
method now in vogue of collecting and
paying for the debts which the student
body incurs during the course of the col
lege year.
These expenses arise from many
sources, principally for the hiring of halls
in which the two intercollegiate debates
are held, together with the printing of
posters and programmes which those
events always involve. The amounts ex
pended for these purposes reach from
J3OO to $400 every year, and up to the
present the only way of meeting them
has been by subscription.
This method has proved very unsatis
factory, as the burden was never dis
tributed evenly over the student body
as a whole.
The Constitutional Committee purposes
to remedy this defect by adopting a plan
which besides establishing a permanent
fund for all student enterprises will in
sure an even distribution of expenses.
The plan is to request the Board of Re
gents to establish what will be know-n
as a students' expenses fee, to be made
compulsory for all students registering
for a term's work. While such a feo
would be merely nominal, about 25 cents
a term, the payment of it, under the idea
suggested, would be absolutely necessary
before registration could take place. The
fund so collected would be retained by
the secretary of the Board of Regents,
and sums could be drawn from it upon
requisition by the president and treasurer
of the Associated Students.
It is understood that the measure meets
with general favor in the college, and a
strong effort will be made to Induce tho
Board of Regents to adopt it before the
opening of the next academic year.
CLUBBED BY HIS BROTHER.
Manuel Thomas Looked for a Family
Row and Found It.
OAKLAND, Feb. 19.â Manuel Thomas
of the Watts tract took exceptions this
afternoon to his stepfather calling him
his son, and in an altercation that fol
lowed Thomas was floored by a club
wielded by his brother Antone. As a re
salt Manuel was treated at the Receiving
Hospital for an ugly scalp wound. He
emphatically declined to give any ac
count of himself.
Antone Thomas was taken to the City
Prison and is detained awaiting further
developments. To a reporter the prison
er said:
â¢ 'We were all gathered at my home on
Dalton avenue in .; Emeryville, and
my stepfather made a remark about
Manuel being his son. Manuel took ex
ceptions to the remark. I told Manuel
not to make any trouble, and got him
outside, when he suddenly turned upon
me with clenched fists. I have been
Moored by him before and knew what It
meant, so I clubbed up the first thing
handy. ' a thick 1 club, and hit him over
the head. I knocked his unconscious."
Antone will be detained and a charge
cf assault with a deadly weapon may be
placed t gainst him.

BELIEVES IN EXPANSION.
Rev. Dr. Coyle Ininks We Should
Keep the Philippics.
OAKLAND. Feb. 19.â Rev. Dr. Coyle at
the First Presbyterian Church to-night
spoke on "Expansion and Slaughter,"
dwelling particularly upon the Philippine
question. He said in part:
"Progress and pain are inseparable. The
whole creation groaneth and trava.lleth m
pain together until now. because it is
growing, expanding creation. In every
direction it involves struggle and agony
and death. Theorize about it as we may,
bewail it as we will, God's worid is full
of growing pains, and is likely to be until
the end."
The speaker contended that the England
of 1899 Is a far nobler and purer England
than that of 17!ty. largely owing to ncr
wise and humane policy of expansion. He
regarded the retention of the Philippines
as best for the Filipinos, for the United
States and for :he whole tvorld.

AN INDEPENDENT MOVEMEN/T.
Disappointed Office-Seekers May Start
a New Party.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 19.â 1t is likely that the
dissatisfaction among the candidates who
met with defeat before the conventions of
the two local political organizations will
crystallize Itself into an independent
movement. It is almost certain that sev
eral of the disappointed ones will go be
fore the voters at the April election as in
dependent candidates. Among these are
John Conrad and Louis Schroeder for City
Marshal, and Lin Palmer for Treasurer.
City Treasurer Wheeler cut loose from
both parlies early in the campaign and
announced that he would make a fight for
re-election on his record. Ben J. Smith
stated to-day that he would be in the field
as an independent for the office of City
Trustee. H. H. Barotean feels encour
aged over the great number of candidates
for City Marshal and has decided to enter
the race as an independent.

MEMORY WILL

Outline of Proposed
Celebration.
TO BE TWO ENTERTAINMENTS
FRANK SHEA THE ORATOR AND
R CULLINAN THE POEl\
The Grand Leading Feature of the
Occasion Will Take Place at
the Mechanics' Pavilion
in the Evening.
The St. Patrick's day convention of 1899
held an adjourned meeting yesterday aft
ernoon at Red Branch Hall, 230 Mason
street. Chairman J. J. Barrett presiding.
Wllliaim Broderick, chairman of the Ex
ecutive Committee, reported that Me
chanics' Pavilion had been secured for
the evening of March 17. and that the
great building would be prepared for the
thousands who are expected to assemble
on that occasion. In fact, Mr. Broderick
predicted that no other hall In the city
was large enough to hold that crowd.
Relativie to the afternoon place of en
tertainment the committee reported that
without doubt the Tivoli would be se
cured. Mrs. Kreling had been seen in re
gard to the matter and it was thought
arrangements would be perfected tp-day.
The Tivoli people will put on their own
entertainment, which will be some piece
or programme appropriate to the occa
sion, reserving time for a short oration
and poem, both taking not more than
forty-five minutes or an hour. The prices
of admission will probably be similar to
those on matinee occasions. It was
thought that such an arrangement would
be far more satisfactory and provide a
better class of entertainment than by any
other. Moreover, the Tivoli management
would not permit the use of that the
ater unless they were to provide most
of the entertainment. If by any slip the
theater is not secured the committee will
engage Metropolitan Temple, and the
Literary Committee will prepare a pro
gramme for the afternoon's entertain
ment. The report of the Executive Com
mittee was approved.
The chairman desired to correct a state
ment In the press that a committee was
soliciting funds for the celebration,
which was not the case. The convention
expected to raise a good sum of money
from the entertainment at the pavilion,
all of which after the payment of nec
essary expenses would be donated to the
Youths' Directory-
The literary committee reported that in
the evening at the Mechanics' Pavilion an
interesting programme would be rendered.
There would De a grand chorus of 500
voices, under the leadership of Professor
John McKenzie, who would also give a
song composed for the occasion, entitled
"My Own Dearest Boy," and dedicated to
the Youths' Directory. There would also
be stereopticon views of Ireland, with ap
propriate music; Irish scnool of dancing,
by O'Connor and Kelleher: competitive
drill, by two companies of the League of
the Cross, and fancy dancing by little
girls, as well as other interesting features.
It was stated that Professor McKenzie
desired the singers who intended to take
part to call upon him at 524 Eddy street.
The price of a single admission to the
Pavilion was fixed at 25 cents.

COMMENCEMENT OF A
PROMISING MISSION
REDEMPTOBJST FATHERS AT ST.
MARY'S CATHEDRAL.
Three Able Representatives of the
Celebrated Order of Missionaries
Begin a Noble Work.
With the celebration of solemn high
mass at 11 o'clock yesterday morning in
St. Mary's Cathedral a two weeks' mis
sion was begun under the direction and
by three of the most eloquent and able
representative of the Redemptorlst Com
munity of Priests, Fathers Bond, Hild
and Fagan. The object of the mission
is to encourage the members of this par
ish In the strict practice of their reli
gion by teaching them the true road to
salvation.
Immediately after the first gospel of the
mass, the initial sermon, which virtually
opened the mission, was preached to the
congregation. In it was outlined the true
purpose of the undertaking which was
about to be inaugurated by the Redemp
torist Fathers. The earnest hope was ex
pressed that all those present would en
deavor to aid the mission by attending
the various exercises to be held within
the coming two weeks and by performing
the duties that the conditions of the mis
sion will exact.
During the present week the first mass
with an appropriate sermon for those who
follow the mission exercises will begin
promptly at 5;30 o'clock in the morning;
the second mass and sermon will be at 9
o'clock. The evening devotions will be
gin at 7:30 o'clock every day of the week.
It is probable there could be no better
time selected for this work than the
present. A certain feeling that during
the Lenten season every Catholic should
do something in the way of self-sacrifice
and prayer prevails throughout the en
tire congregation. This feeling will now
be given special encouragement by the
advent of the Redemptorists. They will
preach to and pray with and for those
â¢who come to listen to their words of in
struction from the pulpit and their words
of advice and guidance in the sacred pre
cincts of the confessional. No effort will
be spared to make the present mission
one pf tho most successful that has ever
been' held in thi? city. The lessons taught
by the missionaries will inspire those who
attend their lectures with a deeper and
fuller sense of their religious obligations,
and will bring them in closer communion
with their Redeemer.
It is the expressed hope of Very Rev.
J. J. Prendergast. V. G., that every par
ishioner will regularly attend the exer
cises, approach the sacraments and gain
all the spiritual favors and graces at
tached to the mission.
PENIEL MISSIONS FOUNDERS.
T. P. and Mrs. M. P. Ferguson Visit
ing in San Francisco.
The three Peniel branch missions in this
city ar now receiving a visit from the
founders of the organization, T. P. and
Mrs. M. P. Ferguson of Los Angeles. They
;|e accompanied by G. B. Studd, editor
of the Peniel Herald, the organ of the
missions. This religious work began in a
remarkable manner.
About three years ago Mr. and Mrs. Fer
guson, who had been for eight or ten
years engaged in reiigious work, received
a mysterious donation of $25,000. They
were directed to use the money wholly in
the cause of city missions; that the mon
ey was from th^ Lord.
The Fergusons, with this and other do
nations, as soon as they could procure a
lot, erected a fine church in Los Angeies
at a cost of $50,000. It Is situated at 227
Main street. From this one mission the
posts have spread until they can now be
found all over the State, also in Alaska,
India and Arabia.. * The name. Peniel,
comes from that given by Jar-ob to the
scene of his all-night wrestle with me
angel.
The branch missions in this city are
San Francisco No. 1, basement Caliiornia j
and Kearny streets, conducted by Misses j
C. Knowlton and Clow; San Francisco
No. 2, "Josephine" Peniel. 45 Third street.
Mrs. Drain, Misses Butler and Baldwin;
San Francisco No. 3. Kearny and Mont
gomery avenue, Misses A. Johnson and
Burton.
One of the features of the mission at 49
Third street is a midnight prayer meeting
from 11 o'clock to 1, held every night tne
year around.

THOUSANDS of spectators filled every
nook and cranny of Mechanics' Pa
vilion last night to witness the finish
of 'the six-day race. There was noth
â¢â ' in* spectacular about it. It simply ran
..r.d-owp like a clock with a weakened main
'â¢â¢â¢-. i'pring. ' , .. -.
â¢â¢'. .'-.The men had ridden so desperately that
'they practically crowded the mileage of
'â¢â¢â¢ Â« six-day race into the first five days of
â¢"â¢ : .-the contest. As a result they had, with
':â¢â â¢ 'the exception of Miller, ridden one an
/'â¢i other to a standstill. When it came to
'â¢â¢'â¢"the closing hours of the struggle the posi
''â¢â¢'tionsof the men were assured, so their
â¢ "".riding was more in the nature of an cx
.=. Munition than sharp competition. The
" .only exception to this was the contest for
â¢' â¢fryurth place between Hale and Gimm.
"'At-the end of the third day the latter was
' ''going great guns and had a commanding
â¢lead' on his field. Upon entering the
"â¢' -fourth day he commenced to lag. Instead
"'â¢of -fighting every inch of the way. as had
â¢ 'been his custom when challenged, he left
" 'lap after lap slip from his grasp. Miller
V: was the first to pass him. A day later
â¢'â¢Aronson, to the surprise of everybody
'""forced him into third place. He did not
' : .hold that long when Frederick displaced
. :hrm. â ,
â  ' For the past two days Gimm suffered
"â¢Intensely. His features were drawn and
"haggard, while his hands and legs were
I-".-" badly swollen. He could hardly remain
" "on" 'his wheel and tired nature finally gave
'â¢ â¢ way about 8 o'clock last night. He col
" lapsed on his wheel and had to be carried
from the arena. Hale then passed him
' = for " fourth place, and poor Gimm could

kept the secret until a few. days ago,
â when they gently but uurepentantly
broke the news to the father and mother
6t the groom, and the widowed mother
of the bride. - .
. Dr. Schord and Miss Papst had been
sweethearts for over two years and the
relatives of both acknowledged and
agreed that sooner or later it would be
satisfactory to all concerned for the
young people to become man and wife.
The parents of Dr. Schord admired the
lady of his choice and the young: man
â¢was eminently pleasing to the mother of
.Miss Papst; but owing to the youth of
the two lovers the relatives thought it
better that they should wait for a year.
Dr. Schord started to practice dentistry
a. short time ago and his father advised
him to become lirmly established in busi
ness before taking a wife.
Waiting was distasteful to the love-lorn
-couple. They realized that the parents
wished well by them in cautioning delay,
but considered the heeding of the advice
of their elders a hardship. The festivi
ties of the Christinas holidays brought
the lady and gentleman much together,
'end they decided that they would no
â¢ â¢ longer d"e!ay mSrriage. The old adage,
"Love laughs at locksmiths," they
".. thought might well be changed to "Love
laughs at parental objections." So they
determined to marry without consulting
any one or anything but their own
hearts. â¢
An elopement was proposed, and the
romance of a runaway match appealing
Ftronglv to the gentleman and his lady
love alike, the idea was adopted and an
elopement determined upon. On the
morning of December 28 Dr. Schord and
Miss Papst took the train for San Jose

JORDAN ON SCHOOL SUFFRAGE
President of Stanford University on
the Selection of Teachers.
The following is an extract from a per
sonal letter written by Professor xja.vi<\
Starr Jordan giving his views on school
suffrage:
The schools of California under Â»the control
of urlvate schemes and partisan manipula.-
tlons are far less effective than the schools of
a free commonwealth should be. The main
reason for this is the Influence of vulgar
greed, which enters under the name
politics. Teachers are chosen for any reason
rather than character and merit, and the chil
dren suffer accordingly. A remedy for this
condition lies in school suffrage for woman.
The Interest of women in school affairs is
much more vital than that of men, for the
school Itself is an extension of the home and
belongs In a large degree to woman's province.
This Interest dies out If there Is no way of
working It tnto action. To give life to It we
must allow women a voice in school manage
ment. I hereby Indorse Senator Smith's bill

MILLER TELLS OF HIS RIDE.
CHARLES MILLER, champion six-day bicycle racer, said after the race
was finished and he had retired to his tent:
"It was a long, weary grind, but was not specially painful after the
second day was passed. The first forty-eight hours were agonizing on ac
count of the fast clip set. After that I ground away without much mental or
physical suffering. Once I went out of my head and when my trainer told me
to get on my wheel I wanted a long coat, because I feared to expose myself
"I did not consider time as I rode. Of course I saw the clock, but I did
not know whether it was morning or afternoon. After the third day was fin
ished I imagined that I had gone but forty-eight hours, and could not under
stand it. My knee valns me considerably, but that will be well in a few days.
The only real discomfort I feel is a saddle-soreness.
"When Waller dropped out I felt much easier, but Gimm began to worry
me the first few days. Still I knew that he wouldn't last and that I would
win My preliminary training accounts for my gooa present condition. In
three weeks preceeding the meet I made 2000 miles in the open. I expect to
be about to-morrow, though of course I will be stiff. The greatest hardship
is experienced when your trainer wakes you up. Ten hours is all the sleep I
had during six days, but I will get a good one to-night."
CONNECTING CÂ£YLON AND INDIA
The South Indian Railway to Build
a Railroad From Madura to
Paumban.
Arrangements for the construction of
the Madura-Paumban Railway have
now been finally made between the
Secretary of State and the South In
dian-Railway Company. The proposed
I formation, of a subsidiary company for
I the construction of the line has been
i vetoed, and the construction work will
be intrusted to the South Indian Rail
way Company itself. The capital re
quired will not, however, be raised by
the company in the open market, but
will be provided by the Government.
The first allotment of funds will be
made at the beginning of the next fin
ancial year, 1. c., at the beginning of
April, by which time the South Indian
Railway Company will be quite ready
to commence construction work. The
alignment for the proposed railway has
been engaging the attention of the Gov
ernment of Madras for some time past.
Two routes have been under consider
ation. One route starts from a point
on the South Indian Railway main line,
north of the Vaigai River, a mile or so
to the north of Madura Station; and
thence, passing through Sivaganga by
a detour involving some nine mil^s ex
tra length, until the river Vaigai is
crossed, follows the south bank of that
river to its terminus on the sea. The
other route leaves Madura Station at
its south end, and continues on the
south side *of the Vaigai River to the
sea terminus. This latter route Is some
nine miles shorter for all through traf
fic than the former. In endeavoring to
arrive at a decision as to which of these
two routes possesses superior advan
tages the Madras Government had to
consider, first, the interests of the
through traffic with Ceylon, interests
which undoubtedly demand the adop
tion of the South Vaigai route on ac
count of its shorter length; secondly,
the Interests of local development; and,
thirdly, whether or not it would be
either possible or desirable, In deciding
on the location of the line, to influence
in one way or other the solution of that
important problem of the futureâ the
threatened short-circuiting of the South
Indian Railway by the extension of the
Mayaveram-Mutupet Railway south
ward to a junction with the Madura-
Paumban.
This last consideration formed the
subject of careful inquiry on the part
of the Madras Government, which, in
common with the agent of the South
Indian Railway Company, recognizes
that it probably is inevitable that at
some future time a connecting link
should be made between the southern
end of the Tanjore District Board's
lines of railway and some point on the
Madura-Paumban Railway, whicn will
deprive a considerable mileage of the
South Indian Railway of much of its
present traffic. The agent of the South
Indian Railway made, in this connec
tion, certain proposals in regard to the
route the projected Padukota Ratlway
should take, as also the mode in which
this and the Mayaveram-Mutupet Rail
way should be made to meet the Ma
dura-Paumban line, so that a part of
the effect of this Inevitable short-cir
cuiting of the South Indian Railway In
the future might be neutralized. But
the Madras Government decided that
the tameness of the finish In the big race,
they were more than compensated by the
sensational riding In the short-distance
events. Fournler, with his petroleum
driven machine, added interest to the
hair-raising struggle between the sprint
ers. . â  .
The tired riders expect to be about
again, but it will be-some time before
they regain the condition in which they
were^ bef orÂ« the race.
"The event 6* the evening, rollowing the
finale of the six-day race, was a five
mile paced match between Harry Elkes,
the American hour-record holder, and
Jay Eaton, the "indoor king." . The
"King" did not hold his throne long last
night, however, as Elkes caught him in
short order, and after covering a couple
of more miles gained another lap. Elkes
was paced by tandems mounted by Coult
ter-Stevens, Lawson-Leonart, Downing-
Cotter Birdsall-Theisen and Turville
brothers. Eaton depended upon Four
nier's "infernal machine," which could not
cut out the pace that Eaton wanted, how
ever, and the "King" did not live long.
Elkes 1 time for the five miles was 9.52
one second better than his world s record
time of 9:53, made Saturday night, and
his performance was wildly applauded.
The Australian pursuit race was won
by Charles Turvilie. In the first heat
Chapman beat Waller; in the second Tur
vilie defeated Stevens. The imal be
tween Turvilie and Chapman lasted one
mile Â«nd seven laps, at which timÂ» lur
ville caught his opponent, the time being
419 4-S '
'EdC!<- Bald made the greatest tUU lie
has put up during the tournament in ns
half-mile exhibition. The genial Eddie
was doubtless inspired by the immense
crowd present, for he brought his own
previous record down to 55 seconds flat,
a truly phenomenal ride, considering the
fact that Bald had sprinted out to the
beach and back in the morning and had
ridden an exhibition in 56 in the afternoon
at the track.
Jimmy Michael lowered the track rec
ord for one mile to 1:512-5 in his exhibi
tion, paced by Fournier. It seemed as if
the "rarebit. was flying, so. fast did he
round the curves,- and he beat out his
pacer by half a lap at the finish.
"Kid" McCoy as a starter of the races
is a decided success, and nightly meets
with a friendly reception that indicates
his popularity. . , . Â
The talent met with a surprise in the
one-mile pursuit race between Downing
and Cotter on a tandem and Fournier on
his machine. Fournier has never lost a
race of this kind before, but he was
beaten last night by the California boys,
who covered the mile in 1:54 2-5.
To-night and to-morrow night the Pa
vilion will be closed, to give the riders a
well-earned rest, as most of them have
had a hard week of it. The _ building will
be reopened Wednesday night with a big
match race between Harry Elkes, the
American paced champion, who defeated
Eaton last night, and Floyd arland
of San Jose, the California champion, at
fifteen miles, paced by twenty riders.
There will also be a tandem pursuit race
between Downing and Cotter, of Califor-
nia, who have carried everything before
them In their class of race heretofore, an -
Eaton and Goodman, of New York, the
Eastern champions en tandem. There will
also be a multicycle handicap be
tween riders mounted on tandems, trip
lets, quads and quintets, which promises
to be wildly exciting, as the big machines
cut out a terrific clip when once started.
The local amateurs will again be given a
chance to show their prowess in a mile
handicap and a mile open scratch.
Next Friday night the men who have
iuat finished the six-day race, and who
by that time will be sufficiently rested,
will start on a 24-hour race for the world's
championship. There will also be numer
ous short-distance events and paced races
Thursday. Friday. and Saturday nights.
Pat Powers of the firm of Brady, Pow
ers & Kennedy arrived here yesterday in
time to see the finish of the big race. He
was delighted with the big attendance,
naturally, and, after coming from the
blizzard-stricken Jr^ast, was glad to be In
a more equable climate.
Miller rides an Eldridge bicycle. â¢
| such proposals could not be entertained,
| and that the alignment of the Madura-
Paumban Railway should be settled
with sole reference to local conditions.
It accordingly came to the conclusion
that, in the interests not only of
through traffic, but also of local devel
opment, not to mention convenience
and economy of railway working, the
South Vaigai route should be adopted
in lieu of the alternative course. But
j the Government is of opinion that, for
I the full local utilization of the Madura-
I Paumban Railway, the country -north
! of the Vaigi River should be brought
from the first into touch with the rail
way by the construction of an eight or
nine mile branch to Sivaganga, crossing
I the Vaigai at Mutanandal. It only re
mains to state that the branch in ques.
tion would be constructed simultan
eously with the main line.â The Times

A Terrible Fate That an Oculist's
Patient Had to Face.
Somehow it made ma fee! badly, this
happening that I am about to relate. I
was in the office of ah oculist, one of the
leading men in his ftrofession in Pitts
burg:. A big. burly, strong and healthy
looking man entered. His appearance in
dicated that he had many years of life
beiore him. He was well dressed, keenly
intelligent and of pleasant countenance.
"Doctor, my eyes have been troubling
me, and I would like you to make an ex
amination of them and treat them."
After a few preliminary questions the
doctor told him to strip himself to the
waist. He took off his clothes and stood
there, a magnificent specimen of man
hood. The doctor examined him, paying
particular attention to his back, for a
reason of which I knew nothing. Hav
ing finished, he said:
'"Put on your clothes; I can do nothing
for you. Your sight may last six months,
but no longer. Treatment will do no good.
Blindness is sure to come."
"What's the matter, doctor?" he asked,
quietly, with a faint tremor in his voice.
The doctor told him in technical lan
guage and then explained that the trouble
came from the wasting of a nerve lead
ing from the spine.
''What's your bill, doctor?" asked the
man. when he got his clothes on.
"Five dollars," replied the doctor.
He paid it and left the office without
another word. In the fullness of life he
walked out into the blessed light of day,
doomed to darkness until death within six
months. It was an incident to the doctor;
to me it was a tragedy.â Pittsburg News.
A Juror's Remarkable Error.
An incident occurred at the Courthouse
at MqMinnville, Term.. the other day that
is unique in the criminal annals of the
State. William Brown had been on trial
for several days charged with the murder
of his wife, and that afternoon the jury
returned a verdict of guilty of morder in
the first degree, which means hanging In
that State. Just as the Judge was about
to pronounce sentence one of the jury
men stated that he had passed through
the trial under the impression that it
was John, the brother of the murdered
woman, who was on trial, and not the
husband, and that he had viewed the tes
timony from an entirely different stand
point than he would have done if he had
thoroughly understood the case. This de
velopment necessitated setting the ver
dict aside, which the Judge did after some
rather pointed remarks at the sovereign
who had sat through five days of an ex
citing criminal investigation and had not
been able to learn who was on trialâCin
