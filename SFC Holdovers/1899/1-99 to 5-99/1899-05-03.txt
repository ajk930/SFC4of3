VOLUME LXXXV- NO. 154.
ATKINSON IS PLAINLY
ACCUSED OF TREASON
WASHINGTON, May 2. â The
Postmaster General has direct
ed the Postmaster at San Fran
cisco to take out of the mails for
Manila three pamphlets issued by
Edward Atkinson of Boston, vice
president of the Anti-Imperialist
League. This order does not apply to
the circulation of the pamphlets by
mail in this country, but bars their
dispatch from this country to the
Philippines, discontent and even mu
tiny among the soldiers being stated
by the department to be the design
of those publications.
The three pamplets are specifically
described and under no circumstance
are they to be forwarded by mail to
the Philippines.
The three pamphlets are those which
havo the tit!": "Criminal Aggression
by Whom?" "The Cost *">f a National
Crime" and "Tho Hell of War and Its
Penalties.!'
These, unless something should de
velop to necessitate further action, may
be circulated through the iris within
this country. Accordine to Mr. Atkin
son's own statement, as reported, a
large number of the pamphlets have
beep sent out. The matter was brought
to the attention of the postal officials
by the War Department, whose au
thorities were greatly exercised at a
suggestion that some action be taken.
It is thought there is little possibility
of any of these publications getting
past the San Francisco olfiee. but if a
few should the military authorities in
the Philippines will promptly suppress
them. Postmaster General Smith made
this statement to-day:
'Thes.- pamphlets actually incite to
mutiny, atid it would be utterly un
justifiable i" permit their circulation
among ihe soldiers in I 'â¢.â  Philippines.
Their circulation is a movement to in
duce the soldiers to disobey orders and
in effect to embarrass and resist the
Government in whose service they are
engaged. Their circulation except in
tho mails for the Philippines is not in
terfered with, because, In being sent to
Maniia. they are destined for soldiers
fighting our battles, but in this coun
try the effort to incite to mutiny could
have no result. Not only are they de
signed to incite to mutiny the American
soldiers <*n those islands, but also to
foment and encourage Insurrection on
the part of the Filipinos themselves.
"Such seditious literature as now es
topped might havo an effect on the
forces we now are dealing with that
â would incalculably revert to their ad
vantage, and certainly would tend to
stimulate and strengthen their already
â weakening cause. The law covering the
case is ample. What action might be
takenâ and the offense is of the gravest
characterâ is not to be discussed. I
do not believe there is any Intention to
prosecute Mr. Atkinson, as the matter
now stands. The authority to do so,
however, is plain. He not only attacks
the President and the Government In
the most virulent language ami dis
putes the national policy, but also calls
>-n the American troops to defy the
Government. Certainly this Govern
ment is empowered to stop or check, as
it sees fit, the circulation of these se
ditious publications."
ATKINSON'S PAMPHLETS
OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
BOSTON, May 2.â Hon. Edwin At
kinson, vice president of the Anti-Im
perialist League of this city, said he
had received no direct communication
from Washington about the action of
the Postmaster General. He explained
that the documents were compilations
of facts and figures taken from debates
in the National House and Senate, and
calling attention to points overlooked
in debate.
"By the action of tho Senate." Mr.
Atkinson continued, "these compila
tions were published as Senate docu
ments, and they are now public docu
ments of the United States. Therefore
any action taken toward keeping them
out of the mails would imply that
Congressional records and official
documents of the United States are un
suitable to be sent til officers "f the
volunteer regiments now at Manila
whose terms of service have expired
and whose return to this country is de
manded by officials of certain States,
who say that the men are entitled to
discharge.
"It is said the dispatch of these
pamphlets from this country to the
Philippine islands is barred lest they
should create discontent and even mu
tiny among the soldiers, that being
stated by the department to be the de
sign of these publications. There are
two pamphlets only. The first edition
of the first, printed in November, was
dedicated to President McKinley In
support of his statement that 'forcible
action would be criminal aggression."
"These pamphlets were, on April 24
and 25, addressed by me to Admiral
George Dewey, President Schurman,
Professor Worcester, General H. G.
Otis. General Lawton, General Miller
and the correspondent of a New York
illustrated weekly in Manila. None of
these have to my knowledge been sent
to any one else. I desired to Bend them
to other officers, and for that purpose
notified the War Department of my In
tention and asked for a list that would
give nic the names. If it is unlawful
for a citizen of th.- United States in
communicate with other citizens in
Manila by sending documents in a pri
vate edition which have been printed
by order of the United States Senate as
public documents. I am content to leavf
the matter at that exact point, which
requires no comment from me.
"1 would, however, call the atten
tion of the Postmaster General to the
necessity of requiring that all news
papers lately printed here and else
where which contains the late speech of
Senator Hoar, given at the Republican
Club in Boston, in which he used this
expressive phrase. 'I can see no differ
ence in 'In' lynching of a Southern
postmaster and lynching a people be
cause they think a government derives
its just powers from the consent of the
governed, and got those Ideas from the
constitution of the United States.' be
taken from the mails.
"If this attempt to forbid free speech
and free mails to the people of this
country has been made, which I can
not believe, I think the people will de
-1 cide themselves what to do about it."

THE DOCUMENTS
ATKINSON SENT
TO THE SOLDIERS
BOSTON, May 2.â Mr. Atkinson to
night gave to The Call correspond
ent copies of the alleged treason
able documents sent to soldiers in
the Philippines, The flrst of the docu
ments is entitled "The Cost of a National
Crime," "The Hell of War and Its Penal- j
tlesi" On the flrst page, just below tho j
title. appears the following: "Tenth edi
tion, making twenty-two thousand. Two
treatises suggested by the appointment of
a day of national thanksgiving by the
President of the United States. From
first edition: This pamphlet is respect
fully dedicated to the President of the
United States, upon whom now rests a
fearful responsibility.
Oh, yet a nobler task awaits thy hand.

Then follow a number of pages devoted
to showing that the Government revenue
under the Dingley bill will be Insufficient
to meet the expenses of a so-called "im
perialistic" policy, and closing as follows:
"I will append one question to each
reader: 'How much Increase of taxation
are you willing to bear and how many of
your neighbors' s=ons are you ready to
sacrifice by fever, malaria and disease in
order to extend the sovereignty of the
United States over the West Indies and
the Philippine Islands'." By such policy
we throw away our previous exemption
from militarism, which constitutes one of
our chief advantages in establishing low
cost of production coupled with high
rates of wages or earnings, computed by
myself at 6 per cent per annum on our
total annual product, by which advantage
we were attaining a paramo control
of trade on th*- export of our goods to
every port of the world-*. commerce. '
This Is dated "Boston, November 21,
lÂ«i8." an.l is signed by "Edward Atkin
son." .._. . .
Here is another citation: . "The pretexts
upon which this so-called policy of im
perialism Is promoted consist of mixed
motives of piety. profits and patriotism.
"To the advocates who hope for a great
field of missionary service we may put
the question: How many of the youth of
America will you subject to vice as a sac
rifice for each heathen convert that you
may make? ' , ,
"To the advocates of .the expansion nt
commerce we will put the question: How
much will you Increase the power of th*'
people of thÂ« Philippine Islands to con
sume American goods when in fact during
the last ten years they have bought of
us on the average $100,000 worth a year?
yet we have bought of them annually in
the same period an average' of J7.0W.000
worth, mainly of sugar and hemp, and
from the export duties on these products
the Spanish Government has secured its
principal revenue; such export taxes be
ing forbidden bj th* constitution of the
United States. . .
"To those who set up the pretext of
patriotism we call attention to the reflex
of militarism, the pauper labor of conti
nental Europe waiting for its. remedy un
til the masses wh*) carry .the guns urn
them against the classes who carry the
sword to their oppression In the conscript

Europe. **â¢'â â [
"To the workmen we put the question: j
How long will you hear an additional tax

consumed not in proportion to ability but
In proportion to numbers from which the
principal revenues of the United States
are collected' such additional tax upon
every one of your families of Wvv persons
surely coming to no; less than $15 a year.
"Th.- pretexts are piety, profits " and
patriotism; the conclusions vice, venality
and pauperism These are the constants
which surely accompany Hie rule of blood
and iron and the control of the masses
by th*- military classes."
The second part of this first document,
"The Hell of War and Its Penalties."
opens with a "slightly condensed" copy
or a letter addressed to President McKin
ley by Mr. Atkinson under date of No
vember 14. 1898. This letter deals almost
entirely with the danger from Infectious
diseases to be expected In Cuba, Porto
Rico -Mid the Philippines. It says:
"If we are rightly informed there were
2.">,000 United States troops at Manila, but
on an apparent danger that the native
fcrces might take possession of Iloilo and
prove capable of establishing home rule
reinforcements were urgently called for
and three regiments have been hastily
dispatched.
"The United States forces sent to the
Philippines -ire therefore now about
double the number of French soldiers in
the campaign in Madagascar.
"By the rule of proportion, without
making any allowance for the hotter and
more pestilential conditions of the Phil
ippine islands, the death rate In our
forces in the Philippines In the first year
will be one-third, or about 8000 men.
Probably a large number will be sent,
home invalided. . 21 .
"As these conditions must be known to
the executive officers of the Government,
through the records of the surgeon gen
eral's office, the reason becomes plain
why volunteers enlisted for the Cuban or

fair and honest on the part of th*- re
cruiting officers to be put into possession
of t he* facts.'' "
Then comes this, under date of January
13, 1889, over Mr. Atkinson's signature:
"The young men of the United States
.who volunteered in a war undertaken in
the name of humanity are now being
compelled to serve in the 'forcible annex

William McKinley on the llth of April,

SALINAS, May 2.â Another of those
cases wherein a young boy utterly de
praved either by natural tendencies or
by social contact tries to vent his ani
mosity toward companions came to
light in this city to-day. A lad only
fourteen years old deliberately at
tempted to murder three younger play
mates by discharging the contents of
a shotgun at them, because they re
fused to humor him in some childish
fancy. The would-be murderer has
been arrested.
Louie Ragio. the fourteen-year-old i
son of a prominent Spanish family of j
Santa Rita, a little village several miles
north of this city, was playing oh Sun
day with several companions, among
whom were David Prader, Elmer
Thomas and Pearl Thomas. The latter
three had been forbidden to associate
with young Ragio, who was their elder
by several years, for the reason that it
was generally claimed in the com
munity that his Influence over the other
boys was demoralizing. Ragio insisted
on being allowed to join them. The
boys objected to his presence, giving :
the reason why he was not desired.
Ragio rushed off to his home, not far
away, and soon returned with a shot
gun. Coming within a short distance
Of the lads he made some insulting re
marks and then deliberately raised the
gun and fired at them. Fortunately for
the lads the gun was loaded with bird
shot. The small shot took effect about
the face and body of each. Ragio was
not the least nervous or repentant over
the result of his act, but calmly told
the boys he would teach them a les
son, and i_.\th**t shot was not".' enough
he would return in short order with a
charge of buckshot and "fix them."
The three wounded boys were taken I
to their homes. The would-be murderer j
boastfully told of how ;he tried to kill
his companions, and only to-day, it is â 
asserted, changed his story by saying I
it was an accident. The little lads
stoutly deny this statement and assert j
that Ragio tried to murder them. The j
affair created considerable excitement
in Santa Rita, the sympathizers of
Ragio trying to have the affair hushed, j
while friends of the wounded boys were !
as desirous that the culprit should bo I
punished.
The District Attorney placed a charge
against Ragio to-day and the prelim
inary hearing will come up on Satur
day. '

directed to refuse to issue a warrant for

MERRITT SHOWERS
PRAISE UPON THE
SECRETARY OF WAR
DETROIT, May 2.â The Michigan
Society, Sons of the American
Revolution, entertained the vis
iting delegates, officials of the
order and distinguished guests
to-night by a dinner. A feature
which was of peculiar interest was a
speech of General Wesley Merritt.
warmly defending Secretary Alger. He
declared Alger the best Secretary of
War the world has ever seen.
The sneakers chose their own sub
jects, there being no- set responses to set
topics.
Secretary Alger began his speech with
a reference to the struggles of the Pil
grim Fathers to secure "equal rights
and religious freedom to all." and al
luded to the heroic deeds of the revolu
tionary patriots, ancestors of the so
ciety which furnished to-night's enter
tainment-, but he soon turned the at
tention of his' auditors to the more re
cent war with Spain. , The Secretary
spoke at some length of the trials of his
department in equipping the great
army so hurriedly, and expressed his
gratification that ultimately "battles
' were fought and victories won, without
the loss of a gun or a color."
Continuing, he said:
Supposing they had a little beef spoiled,
I what of it? If they had had no beef at
i all they would have had more than Gen
| eral Joe Wheeler and I had In the other
j war. ?â¢â¢..
The people of the United States are an
unselfish people. They have never sought
territorial accession except to the benefit
:of the peoples that came with it. The
flag of this nation has been hoisted over
Cuba. Porto Rico and the Philippines, in
j lands whose people have for centuries
! been oppressed by Spanish misrule.
.Whatever else may be, we can be assured
that as it has been raised in Porto Rico
and. -the Philippines there it will remain. !
j One of these islands we hold in trust; the I
others 'are ours. â¢ The strife that brought |
j upon this country the war with Spain I
was not of our own seeking; the for*.- of
events and the cry of downtrodden hu
manity called for < our aid. No human
mind could stop it. It was to be.
There is not a heart in the breast of any
, true American to-night whose pulsations
do not quicken " with pride over the
achievements of our army and navy. The
i volunteers and the' regulars in the Philip
; pines have won for themselves the na
tion's crown. . All honor to them, and I
I hope and trust that ('ongressional action
shall give such recognition of their serv
ices as shall show to them and to the
world our appreciation of their valor. The
nation mourns for the families who will
never again hoar the footfalls across the
threshold of those they loved; but that is
.the sacrifice they offered, the sacrifice
they have made. .
. We are to-day, we hope, near Ing the
end of the conflict and Hearing the dawn
of peace in the Philippines, and upon
every lip is dally, yes, hourly, expressed:
"What of the, future?" God in his infinite
wisdom can" only answer that question,
and he has guided us thus far, and as his
hand has been. so. plainly. seen in the his
tory of tin 1 'past twelve months we can
feel assured that as he rules, what is
right will be.
; Major General Merritt was the next
speaker. , Said he: *
. When we went to the Philippines there
was, only one. course for us to pursue, viz..
the course that has been taken up to the
present Our navy had captured Manila
Bay and the army had to capture the city
and we could not let go; and the prospects j
are I now that, the American flag will con- ;
tinue to wave in the Far East.
The army in the East, as I testified I
before the Investigating commission in
Washington, had everything the War De
partment could furnish. We lived well
and we did our duty, and we have no
apologies to make or recriminations to
offer. This most outrageously abused ad
ministration has done more for the army
than any other administration that ever
existed. If there were canned speeches j
here to-night they would be better than
some of the refrigerated speeches that we
have read. If I had a canned speech to
deliver, on this subject I assure you it
would not smell.
General Merritt referred to the Secre- 'â 
tary of War as the best Secretary of
War the world has ever seen. He |
added :
No Secretary, was ever more abused. |
Secretary Stanton stood through his
abuse as the most fearless Secretary that
ever lived. We have now another Secre
tary, who has made fewer mistakes and
been more abused than any of ids prede
cessors. He has the confidence of all ex
cept a few malcontents. Through him j
has been attacked the President of the
United States.* He is almost sick at heart ;
at the weight of unjust obloquy that has j
been heaped upon him; but with no prom- j
ises to make or platitudes to indulge in, 1
he is conducting aji honest administration. i
1 was born a Democrat. I don't think j
I'll ever get over it. I'm proud to belong j
to that .political faith. (A voice: "You're j
a Republican, but don't know it.") But |
I hope the time will come when there will |
be no differences between Democrats and j
Republicans, at least manifested against
those who rule the Government. I talk '
as a soldier. I don't commit myself to !
any complications that may lead to

STOCKTON, May 2.â Mrs. Virgine
Hassell, a dashing young English
woman, murdered Mrs. William
Hickman early this morning and
then ended her own life.
Mrs. Massed was known as "The
Countess." and Mrs. Hickman is said to
have been a victim of her unnatural af
fection. They were found dead in bed.
locked in each other's arms. The re
sponsibility, for the tragedy was easily
fixed by the circumstances surrounding
it. The woman had a. steady hand and
knew where to shoot to produce in
stant death.' Mrs. Hickman was shot
through the. left temple, and the mur
deress then ended her own life with a
bullet through her. right temple.
The scene of the double murder was
the Leffer roomine-house, 216 South
Sutter street, at which, place Mrs. Has
sell made, her home. The intimacy be
tween Mrs. Hickman and Mrs. Hassell
had been a source of comment in cer
tain circles for some time.
Mrs. Hickman w.s a woman with two
children, a daughter of T. J. Smith and
related through marriage to one of the
leading families of Stockton. Of late
Mrs. Hickman's husband and relatives
have been making strenuous efforts to
keep the women apart. Mrs. Hassell
never lost an opportunity to
hunt her up and get her out to visit at
the rooming house. During the last
week the relatives of Mrs. Hickman
were congratulating themselves that
the pair were becoming less infatuated
with each other.
Yesterday afternoon the two met, and
Mrs. Hassell said she had just received
a remittance from England, and in
tended to start back home this morn
ing. She wanted Mrs. Hickman to
spend her last night in Stockton with
her. She also went to the Smith home
and made the same statement, with the
result that the two started for the
private lodging house. The English
woman was seen to- mail some letters at
about 11 o'clock, and also purchased
some bananas at a stand at the same
time.
None of the inmates of the place,
other than "Jack" Lawson, remember
having heard the shots when the
tragedy was enacted. Lawson says
that at about 4:30 o'clock he heard
two reports, a few secconds apart, but
supposed the noise was on the street
and was a part of the Dewey celebra
tion.
The discovery of the crime was due
to the uneasiness of Mrs. Hickman's
father over her having been away all
night with Mrs. Hassell. When the
daughter did not come to the store he
set out for the Hassell lodgings to in
vestigate. He knocked on the door
and received no answer. The father
lost no time in breaking the door open
and the sight terrified him.
The bed was in the northwest corner
of the room. Mrs. Hickman was on
the side next to the wall, lying over
the side, with her head turned toward
Mrs. Hassell. Mrs. Hassell's left arm
was under Mrs. Hickman's head,
caressingly, and Mrs. Hickman's left
hand was resting on Mrs. Hassell's
bosom.
Mrs. Hassell's head was thrown back
and her mouth was open. She was ly
ing on her back, her right arm thrown
across, near the face of her companion,
and the pistol with which the double
tragedy had been committed had ap
parently just slipped from her lifeless
fingers. The hair of the two women
was matted with clotted blood, and the
pillows on which they lay were satur
ated. The doors and windows were all
securely locked, showing that no one2
had entered the apartments. On a
large trunk was a note:
"This trunk and machine, with con
tents, is the property of Miss Edith
Cox, 1723 Valdez street, Oakland."
This was the only message left Mrs.
Hassell had torn up several pictures
of herself, but a large panel portrait of
her friend reposed on the bureau.
Edith Cox, the girl mentioned in the
note, arrived here to-night. She was
Mrs. Hassell's, or as she always re
spectfully addressed her, "the Coun
tess' " maid. She knew the woman in
England. After Virgine Mathilde
Reike, "the Countess," had become the
wife of a remittance man, she sent for
the girl to come out and live with her.
Miss Cox says Mrs. Hassell was
reared In Carlisle Mansion. London, at
which place her mother died less than
eighteen months ago. The mother had
a bona fide title, derived from the
French side of the family, and the
father, who died many years ago. left
considerable property.
"Mrs. Hassell's mother kept up a pa
latial establishment," she continued,
"and when she died, about all she left
to poor Mrs. Hassell was the French
titleâ genuine, I know, but T cannot at
this minute recall it. The young
Countess has had every advantage. She
had her swimming and dancing mas
ters. She rode like a man and often
went off into Scotland on a hunt. She
was finely developed and few men could
equal her for all-around athletics. She
was always odd and did not care a snap
what the people thought of her. She
would go up into her room and smoke a
cigarette and gossip. She always car
ried a small revolver in her bosom ever
since I knew her. She was a dead shot
and brought to this country with her a
gun which she had had made at a cost
of .Â£6O.
"A year ago last January, and shortly
after her mother's death, she got what
money she could together, and, with an
old lady, started out on a trip of the
world. On an ocean liner she met Has
sell, and as he was suave and made
gjpat representations regarding his
landed interests in California, she came
overland to San Francisco with him and
they were married. They came to
Stockton, and in June, at her request,
I came out from England, bringing sev
eral of her trunks with me. I found
them living in a scantily furnished
rented house, and the Countess selling
her silver plate and pawning her valu
ables in order to get food. He put on
airs, and the poor woman even picked
chickens for the market. It ended by
him beating and abusing her, and last
July they separated.
"She went out to' work in a private
family, and later got into a store. She
got some money from England occa
sionally, and I understood she had some
interests remaining there which would
be quite valuable if they ever got out
of court. I went to Oakland to work,
and. like a fool, have been sending
every cent of my earnings to her in
order to Indulge her as far as possible
In what she had been used to.
"A month ago her letters began com
ing irregularly, so I came up to Stock
ton tn see what was the matter. We
ate and slept together, and she seemed
as cheerful as usual. We made plans
to go back to England soon, and she
never once rationed having any new
trouble. She was not a woman ho
would allow any man to break her
heart. She did love Mrs. Hickman,
though.
"When I ram* I found she had been
giving nearly everything she had in
the way of clothing and fancy articles
to Mrs. Hickman. Her valuables she
had been selling to keep up her wants.
She had several trunks of the finest
kind of things a few months ago, in
cluding some silver plate. I suppose
all is gone.
"She probably wrote me a letter, but
I missed it at Oakland in my hurry to
pet here. That may throw some light
on the tragi

Janeiro and was not yet 28 years old.
Her father was, I believe', in the Brit

Mis. Hickman was known before her
marriage as "Beauty Smith." The
woman who ended her life was of
striking appearance. Her dress and
manner indicated that she had not al
ways been forced to limit her expedl
tures.
Has comes of a good English fam
ily. He will bury his wife, whom he
has never ceased to love.
Mrs. Hickman was probably shot
while she slept, as her eyes were closed
as if in sleep. The English woman's
eyes were open and there was a set
look of pain on her face. As far as as
certained to-day Mrs. Hassell had only
75 cents in her possession. Her story
that she had received money from Eng
land and was on the eve of returning
to that country is believed to have been
a myth invented for the deliberate pur
pose of getting Mrs. Hickman into her
power that she might kill her. In the
course of a statement to-day Mr. Smith,
father of Mrs. Hickman, said:
"One day she wanted Emma to go
riding with her and I refused to allow
it. Mrs. Hassell made some remark to
the effect that she would rather die
than be separated from Emma. I then
became afraid of the woman."
HUSBAND TELLS OF A
FORMER INFATUATION
STOCKTON, May 2.-The inquest
over the remains of Mrs. Hickman and
Mrs. Hassell to-night brought out very
little to add to the story iff the tragedy,
save in the testimony of Mr. Hassell!
the estranged husband of the mur
deress. He testified that in London
when his wife was Miss Virginie Kick*-,
she formed the same sort of an attach
ment for a young woman as she did
here for Mrs. Hickman. Then it re
quired all of their influence to break off
the mad infatuation the woman had for
one of her own sex. Here when she
first met Mrs. Hickman she showed tne
infatuation that was so marked ln the
old country, and the husband tried to
check it, but could not.
The jury found that Mrs. Hassell snot
and killed Mis. Hickman as she slept,
and then sent a bullet into her own
brain. '.:'.-'.'.'.
SERVANT GIRL'S LOVE
FOR "THE COUNTESS"
OAKLAND, May 2.â Few, perhaps,
were closer to Mrs. Hassell than her
forme: maid, Edith Cox who came with
her from En_,:_ind to California. Miss
Cox Is at present employed as a domes
tic ln the family of Veterinary Inspect
or Pierce of Oakland. When she learned
of the awful tragedy t l-day she has
tened to Stockton by the early evening
train. Miss Cox ie also .1 very intimate

General Harrison Gray Otisâ **l Have Crossed the Rubicon."
LOS ANGELES, May 2.â The home
coming of General Otis has aroused much
speculation in political circles. This has
been increased by the sudden departure
of Governor Gage for the north, whloh
fact, the friends of Otis assert, Is tan
tamount to a refusal to participate in the
greeting of the soldier editor, and par
ticularly unfortunate a.Â« the executive
there frequently referred to her rela
tions with "The Countess." as Mrs.
Hassell was familiarly called. When
interviewed to-night Mrs. Perry said:
"Edith Cox was Mrs. Hassell's maid
back In England, and she was very
close to her. She frequently told us that
Mis. Hassell had a great deal of trouble
with her husband. She said he married
Mrs. Hassell for her money, and when
that was about gone he wanted her to
sell the silverware, but Edith hid it.
and that very nightâ l thir'- * was last
Julyâ some one set fir.- to the house, so
Edith told us. I know that Mrs. Hassell
must have been hard pressed financial
ly, for Edith frequently sent her money
from her something she could
ill afford, poor girl.
"Edith once said also that Mrs. Has
sell had occasionally referred to a lady
friend at Stockton, of whom she
thought all the world, and I presume
this might have been Mrs. Hickman. I
suppose Edith has gone to Stockton, for
she was so much attached to Mrs. Has-
I sell that if anything happened to her
she would naturally rush to her side."

EPISCOPALIANS IN OPEN
REVOLT AGAINST BRIGGS
Many Clergymen Assert That His

NEW YORK, May 2.â There is now a

Never, it is said, in the history of the
Anglican church in America has it been
confronted with such a crisis. As Dr.
Clendenin has put it the very foundations
ol not only church discipline but of the
faith which forms the foundation of the

CLERGYMEN MEET
AT PACIFIC GROVE
Episcopal Convocation Opens Its Ses
sions in the Seaside
City.
PACIFIC GROVE, May 2.-One of the
most Interesting conventions this town of
many conventions has ever known opened
at St. Marys by the Sea, the pretty little
Episcopal church of this city, this after
noon. It is the convocation of San Jose
of the Episcopal church, and numbers
among its members some of California's
leading clergymen. The ministerial visit
ers were net at th*' train by a reception
committee and driven to the parish house,
where luncheon was served. Then they
proceeded to the church.
Rev. 17 B. A. Lewis of Gilroy, dean of
this convocation, called the body to order.
He presented a report of the work of his
diocese, after which Dr. L. Delos Mans
field of San Jose, treasurer of the convo
cation, made a financial statement. Rev.
Dr. Gardner, the popular young Palo Alto
pastor, was appointed essayist for the
next convocation, his topic to be "The
Relation of Science and Religion."
The object of the convocation is the con
sideration of missionary work to be found
in this diocese and the solution of various
problems affecting the growth of the
church. The afternoon was therefore
chiefly devoted to a discussion of "Chris
tian Science," so called. Rev. J. A.
O'Meara of Santa Clara opened with a
paper ln which the subject was looked
! at from three points of viewâ theological,
scientific and therapeutic. He declared
"Christian science" was a misnomer, the
i cult it designated being essentially not
! scientific, since science classified prov
: able knowledge and was exact and not
j Christian, for it regarded Jesus as a man
of human parents and not as the divine
Christ, thus striking away the very foun
dation of Christianity. ".';-''
"Christian science," he said, "cannot
| stand the test of common-sense. It denies
| the existence of matter and the trust
worthiness of the evidences of the senses,
I while the greatest scientists teach that
matter does â¢â  exist and that the senses
are trustworthy."
Looking at the subject with relation to
therapeutics, he said Christian - science
had been successful in some cases, operat
ing on the principle of the domination of
mind over matter, where the trouble was
of an imaginary nature; but that, ft was
baffled when confronted with surgery.
The paper concluded- with, the statement
that Christian science was the enemy of
I the church of God. because it denied some
of the -most cherished doctrines of the
church and denounced them as delusions.
Vespers were celebrated at 7:30 o'clock.
Rev. William Ford Nichols, Bishop of
California, officiating, assisted by Arch
deacon Emery and twelve other clergy
men. After service the Bishop made an
address upon missionary work in the dio-
I cese of California.

PASTOR CRABB IS
DENIED A DIVORCE
Must Provide for His |
Wife's Support.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 2.â The Rev. W. D.
Crabb, the Methodist divine, has been de
nied a divorce from- his wife, Hattie A.
Crabb. Instead he must pay $20 a month
for her maintenance, besides the cost of
the suit. This was the decision of
Judge Kittredge to-day.
The case, was reviewed by the court.
The charge, on which a divorce was
sought was cruelty, resulting in great
mental suffering. In deciding the case
Judge Kittredge said several things must
be considered. Were the. accusations of
defendant against her husband false? Did
the accusations cause grievous mental In
jury, or did these feelings arise from the
fault of the plaintiff? The accusations
were admitted to be false,, but the court
did not believe the mental suffering of the
pastor arose from the accusation. In
stead there was something else back- of
this trouble. The whole case was a
mystery. He did not believe the true
| cause had been brought out at the trial.
: Hints of the disturbing element could be
i found in the correspondence between Dr.
I Crabb and his wife.
The court said Dr. Crabb's unhappiness
! arose from the fact that he considered
| his wife insane. The attention of the
! minister to teachers while at the Univer
; sity of the Pacific and to his female
: parishioners at Gilroy had nothing to do
with It. He was possessed of the idea
that his wife was Insane seven years ago.
At that time he made the matter known.
Dr. Crabb suffered from this and it
seemed to blight his life. His letters
showed this. That he fully believed his
wife deranged mentally was borne out by
his having sent her to a private asylum at
| Livermore. and later to the Agnews Asy
| lum. During the trial It was conceded
! Mrs. Crabb was sane and responsible, so
i the court would not decide that matter.
| The charge of grievous mental suffering
j through false accusations had not been
I sustained and the divorce was denied.
Judge Klttredge said he did not be
lieve Dr. Crabb had ever written a con
! fession of his love for other women." and
i hinted that the confession produced
In court was forged. He did not believe
there had been any undue intimacy by
Dr. Crabb with female members of his
parish.
It was ordered that the first $20 for
maintenance be paid on May 15, and that
payments be made thereafter on the Ist
jof each month. It was doubtful whether
Mr. Crabb could pay this sum. His sal-
I ary now in a South San Francisco church
! was only $19 a month. Besides this he had
but a few household goods and an inter
est In a parcel of land. Yet he should
contribute something to his wife's sup- j
port. I _
Attorney C. W. Cobb, counsel for Dr.
Crabb. was granted a ten days' stay.

SLIGHT DAMAGE
DONE BY FROST
Fruit Around Fresno Is
Nipped.
â â¦ â -
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, May 2.â number of vine
yardists who were seen to-day, â  said
that fully a quarter of the crop was
ruined by the late frost and that the j
! raisin product would be lessened ac- ;
j cordingly. Not since 1896 was such a j
late and so severe a frost experienced. I
Such reports are invariably exaggerat- j
ed, but there is no gainsaying the fact
that the late frost did considerable
damage. A peculiar thing about the
frost is that it seemed to come in cur
rents. Certain vineyards were dam
aged, while adjacent places escaped al- j
j together, or were only slightly bitten.
I The generally accepted theory is that j
the cold spell went in currents, al- j
! though it may be that local conditions |
j in certain vineyards enabled them to
withstand the frost better than ad
jacent places. For the reason that the
damage was not general it cannot
well be expressed in figures. "';'
SONOMA, May From the present |
indications the fruit crop in this vicin
ity has not been seriously damaged by
frosts. At present an abundant crop
j of fruits, with the exception of cherries,
I prunes and pears, is expected. Of. the
| three varieties excepted, a fair crop is
i assured, while apricots will be very ;
! scarce. Apple orchards and most of
! the peaches will need thinning. Vine- ,
j yards are looking fine and an abundant !
crop is expected. The grain and hay
I crops are both excellent. The showers
I of last week were of great benefit to
both.
RED BLUFF, May 2. â Manton.
thirty-five miles northeast of. Red

was damaged. Even strawberries suf
fered. Manton is the principal apple- |

MATAAFA' MEN
STILL DEFIANT
Situation in the Samoan
Islands Very Critical.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
WELLINGTON. J*. Z.. May Advices
from Samoa indicate that the instructions
received from the powers to cease hos
tilities make the situation in the islands
very serious, as the rebels hold the main
food supplies and are again near the
municipality of Apia.
The correspondent of Reuters News
Agency thinks it Is evident thai the home
authorities have misunderstood the situa
tion in Samoa. The Germans and rebels
are already jubilant and claim a victory
over the British and American forces.
The correspondent says that unless the
rebels are made to submit the difficulties
will remain unsolved. The white people
in the outskirts of the city are at the
mercy of the rebels.
The American Vice-Consul's store at
Falifa was looted last week, while a Ger
man store adjoining it was left untouch
ed, British and American residents all
strongly condemn the action of the pow
ers In ordering cessation of hostilities
at this stage.
Two days after the last battle at Vaili
ma Lieutenant R. A. Gaunt of the Brit- \
ish cruiser Porpoise marched his brigade
Into Valllma unopposed and was followed
by a company or British bluejackets un
der Captain Sturdee and Lieutenant
Cave. An inspection pf the battlefield
shows that the defenses erected by the
rebels near the home of the late Robert
Louis Stevenson were strong and well
planned. The loss sustained by the reb
els, it is evident, was much greater than
was at first supposed. The main section
of Mataafa's followers, who were en
gaged in the battle of Valllma, retreated
westward to Lulumoenga, where they lay
In wait for frlendlies. Orders had been
given them to capture Lieutenant
Gaunt's head. The rebels were also anx
ious to secure the superior weapons with
which his brigade ls armed.
It is rumored that thirteen boats, with
armed rebels, are approaching from the
east. The town appears to lie safe.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1899.
THE FILIPINO ARMY MUST
SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY
MANILA, May The second
conference, held this morning
between General Otis and the
Filipino emissaries, Colonel
Manuel Arguelles and Lieu
tenant Jose Bernal, terminated with
out any definite results.
MANILA, ': May 2.â Major Manuel ,
Arguelles and Lieutenant Jose Bernal j
of the staff of General Antonio Luna re- j
'.. turned to-day to renew the request of l
General Luna for a cessation of hostili
ties. They have found the field of \
> labor a most uncongenial one. , The
two officers were received in confer
! ence with Major General Otis. The
proposals which they had to submit
differed but slightly from those which j
they brought from the Filipinio com- I
mander in the flrst place. They de
i sired a little time in which to sum
mon Congress, and expressed ' them
selves at being confident that the Con
gress will decree peace, because the
i people desire it. They represent that
j Aguinaldo is without power to sur- ]
I render the army, and that the Congress
i must decide that question. Incident
! ally, the Filipino envoys asserted that
Aguinaldo had not yet made a fair
test of his strength against the Amer
lean forces, because only one-third of
his army had been assembled to
gether.
The envoys presented a letter from
Mabini, President and Minister of For
! eign Affairs in the Cabinet of Aguin- j
aldo, and who is the backbone of the |
, Filipino organization. The communi- j
cation is personal and unofficial . and j
seconds Major Arguelles' arguments.
Whether or not General Luna is sin- j
I ' cere in his overtures, the negotiations
: are giving the insurgents a much-need
ed opportunity to rehabilitate their de
moralized force The truth is that dis
sensions among the leaders of the ;
rebels is helping on the disorganization j
of the Filipino army almost as much as I
the American campaign.
In the course of the conference with
the Filipino envoys, General Otis agreed
with the statement of Major Ar
guelles that the people of the Philippines
wanted peace, and he added that re
quests for protection are pouring In :
upon him from all parts of the country.
Major Genera] Lawtc-n was engaged;
in hard fighting early this morning. ;
Telegraphic communication was cut at 9
a. m., and there have been no reports
from Gent Lawton since that time.
The first authentic information re
garding Lieutenant J. C. Gillmore and
his oarty of fourteen men from the
I'nited States gunboat Yorktown. who
were captured by the Filipinos on April
12, was received to-day atÂ» the hands of
Major Arguelles. It is in the form of a
list of the missing men, and is signed
by Lieutenant Gillmore. The Lieutenant
reports that he and his party have been
brought across the mountains from
Baler, where they were captured.
This Information was brought in re
sponse to a note which Major General
Mac Arthur sent to Luna by Major
Shields and Lieutenant Hayne, and
which these officers, bearing a flag of
truce, carried across General Luna's
line yesterday evening.
WASHINGTON, May 2.â The follow
ing cablegram was received at the War
Department at midnight:
MANILA. May 3.â Adjutant General,
Washington: List of prisoners in the
hands of Insurgents just received shows
Lieutenant Gillmore and seven enlisted
men in the navy lost from the Yorktown,
and six enlisted men from the army.
Three of the six were wrongfully arrested
in January before hostilities commenced.
All reported to be doing well. Besides the
above there are two men in the hands of
the Insurgents of the south. Captain
Rockefeller is still unaccounted for.

COLONEL FUNSTON MADE
A BRIGADIER GENERAL
WASHINGTON, May 2.â The President
has appointed Colonel Frederick Funston
of the Twentieth Kansas a brigadier gen
eral of volunteers. This appointment was
recommended by Major General Mac A
rthur and supplemented very strongly by
General Otis In a cable dispatch received
yesterday. General Mac Arthur said the
services of Funston during the campaign,
especially In the crossing of the Rio
Grande, deserve recognition such as his
promotion to be a brigadier general, also
that as a leader of troops Colonel Fun
ston was particularly valuable. The Presi
dent recognises the services of Colonel
Funston. and his first official act on return
ing to Washington was to make him a
brigadier general. The cable General Otis
sent yesterday says: "Mac Arthur strong
ly recommends Colonel Funston's ap
pointment as brigadier general for signal
skill and gallantry In crossing the Rio
Grande and most gallant services since
the commencement of the war.- I urge
his appointment. Funston Is an able lead
er of men and has earned recognition."
AGUINALDO DENIES THAT
HE IS SUING FOR PEACE
LONDON, May 2.â Representatives of
the Filipino Junta, say they have received
a telegram from Aguinaldo, dated April
30, ln which he states that his Govern
ment has nothing to do with the present
peace negotiations, which, he asserts, are
being conducted by a group of half-castes
and Creoles, who are anxious for peace
in the expectation of getting high oflices
under a new government. Several of these
men, Aguinaldo says, are members of the
Filipino Congress, where they are endeav
oring to outvote him. Aguinaldo added
that he had had no direct negotiations
witn the Americans since the fall of
Malolos, when certain proposals passed
between D. .C. Worcester of the American
Philippine Commission and a representa
tive or Aguinaldo to peace based upon In
dependence with an American alliance.
Aguinaldo disavows the present negotia
tions and adds that under no circum
stances will he accept an American pro
tectorate. The dispatch concludes with a
contemptuous reference to Major Argue
les as a Spanish officer who has no more
authority to act on behalf of Aguinaldo
than has Luna himself. â¢ -\yy '--.--
Maher and Buhlin Draw.
NEW YORK, May 2.â Peter Maher and
Gus Ruhlin, "the Akron Giant," fought a
twenty-round draw before the Lenox Ath
letic Club to-night. Maher was nine
pounds the lighter of the two. Maher was
the odds-on favorite at ' 100 to 60. Six
thousand people saw the fight. Maher
weighed 181 pounds and Ruhlin 190. ,
BRIGADIER GENERAL FRED FUNSTON.
NO WONDER "AGGY"
IS A HOME RULER
NEW YORK, May 2.â Peter Scan lan of Jersey City, whose reputation
for voracity Is excellent, declares Aguinaldo, who is giving the Americans
so much trouble in the Philippines, is the son of an Irishman. Mr. Scanlan
says the Filipino leader's right name is O'Gormelly. His father, he says, was
a native of Tralee, County Kerry, who went to Hongkong, where he married
a wealthy Japanese woman. He then moved to Manila. There he engaged
in the grocery business and made a fortune. Aguinaldo was born in Manila,
and In his youth was sent by ids father to Madrid to be educated for the
priesthood, but the lad objected to that calling, aad told his father he wished
to he a second George Washington and free his people. His father then dis
owned him and made a will cutting him off from any share of his prop
erty. : fff _
Mr. Scanlan thinks it is the Irish blood in Aguinaldo that makes him
such a fighter.
NICKEL MACHINES
WILL HAVE TO GO
Mayor of Los Angeles
on the Warpath.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 2.â Mayor Fred
Eaton at to-day's session of the City
Council sent a snappy message to that
body by which he returned the ordi
nance to license the nickel-in-the-slot
machines without his approval. This
ordinance was prepared to assist in
raising additional revenue, owing to the
reduced condition of the city treasury.
Mayor Eaton in his message says that
he objects to the ordinance, as it pro
vides for the licensing ' of machines
which pay winnings in money, and that
they are "a notorious sure-thing me
chanical swindle."
After reciting that the City Attorney
has informed him that the machines
are not made illegal devices by law and
according to the rulings of the Supreme
Court cannot be prohibited, he says he
does not believe the city is reduced to
the necessity of gaining . revenue by
licensing such swindling devices, and
that other games might be taxed which
give the player a more even chance.
The message concluded with a broad
side that startled the city patriarchs:
"It seems somewhat anomalous that
in a city where it is lawful to drink
bottled beer on Sunday but unlawful
to drink the same brand of beer when
drawn from a keg the City Council
should license one of the most vicious
forms of petty gambling that is prac
ticed."
The whole was referred to a com
mittee, which in its report said:
Your committee iK appalled to contem
plate the amount of irreparable damage
that would be" occasioned by such a com
promise with satan; an eternity would
not be of sufficient duration to overcome
the evil Incubated during that period of
the maintenance of devices of the char
acter described by the Mayor.
The measure failed to pass over the
Mayor's veto.
To-night Mayor Eaton said he. would
call a special meeting of the Police
Commission to-morrow for the purpose
of giving saloons notice to remove from
their premises all slot machines paying
money to the players under penalty of
losing their saloon licenses.
"If the Council won't take the mat
ter in hand it gratifies me to be able
to do it," said the Mayor.

SOLDIERS A RE
NOW ON GUARD
Confidence Is Gradually
Restored at Wardner.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WARDNER, Idaho, May 2.â The
presence of soldiers has eased the situ
ation remarkably, and to-night the
people are gradually regaining slight
confidence, but it is felt that peace can
not be assured until 500 troops are
quartered here. More troops will ar
rive to-morrow. Captain Batchelor and
his gallant seventy-six soldiers, as
sisted by 100 townsmen, who are un
der arms, would give such resistance
as would annihilate any ordinary force,
but should the 1300 men up . Canyon
Creek arrive fully armed, the little
guard now here could hardly hope to
cope with them.
The old militia guns to the number of
about seventy have all been distributed
among the men here, and what State
ammunition remained has also been
distributed among the men. About
7000 rounds of ammunition belonging to
the old militia force, and stored in the
vaults at the B.unker Hill office, were
lost in the wreck of that property. Be
sides the State guns all the private
arms in town have been put to use.
One group of seventy men is on guard
at the camp of Captain Batchelor's
soldiers. Besides half as many men
are watching the station. Up at the
Bunker Hill mill is another group of
armed men. To-night they came down
to offer their defense to the town, but
later decided that it would be better
for them to return to the property.
This morning a little bunch' of
Bunker Hill men guarding the tram
way were overtaken by some of Sheriff
Young's deputies and their guns taken
from them. Later, on the command of
Auditor Sinclair, the Sheriff consented
to return the rifles to their owners, and
they have been continuing their watch.
State Auditor Sinclair is working
night and day to bring about the ar
rest of the criminals, and is vigorously
assisted by Coroner France. Twelve
complaints have been made out against
the conspirators, but the work is de
layed by the slowness of Prosecuting
Attorney Samuels. Francis Turner has
been arrested. The officials say that he
has positively been identified as one of
the masked rioters who blew up the
Bunker Hill mill. He was released on
$4000 Vail. â¢â -.;' :-7\-.W'.7.
The inquest to-morrow will be a dou
ble one. The body of James Cheyne,
the Bunker Hill man shot, by the
rioters, who died this afternoon in
Spokane, where he/was taken for hospi
tal treatment, will be brought back here
to-morrow. The inquest will take place
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon at Ward
ner Junction. Attorney General Hayes
is now on the road here to conduct the
prosecution. .:.â¢ .
To-night on the flat by the railroad
station little eampfires are flickering,
and the faint call of a bugle is sounding
"taps" for the night. There Captain
Batchelor and his trusty fighters are
stationed. Near them is a little force
of armed men from the nearby town
ready for any emergency.
J Quite a number of union men left to
day on the trains, going in both direc
tions. But two arrests have been made,
and these are both out on bail. Martial
law has not yet been declared, but it is
expected that it will be to-morrow.
Coroner France will commence the in
quest on . John Smith, the union man
killed last week, as soon aa witnesses j
can be subpenaed. *
ITALIAN CABINET
MAY STEP DOWN
Strong Disapproval of
Government's Policy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, May 2.â ln the Chamber of Dep
uties to-day there was a prolonged and
animated discussion regarding the Gov-,
ernment's foreign policy, growing out of
various interpellations. The debate was
adjourned until' to-morrow, when the
Government will make a statement cov
ering all the questions raised.
In the course of the discussion Admiral
Canavero, Minister for Foreign Affairs,
created a lively sensation by producing,
in response to the attacks upon his policy
at San Mun Bay, China, an official letter
signed by Count *Bonin Longare. Under
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in
the Cabinet of Marquis di Rudini, ad
dressed to the then Minister of Marine
Signor Brin, requesting the latter to ini
tiate some action that would secure for
Italy a station in China. The production
of the letter demonstrated that the lead
ers of the present opposition really ini
tiated the policy they are now oppos
ing.
Admiral Canavero's action in making
public a secret document evoked sharp
comment from Marquis di Rudini. Signor
Crispi, former Premier, and other lead
ing members of th*- Chamber.
Finally General Pellieux, the Premier,
asked that the debate be adjourned, and
the House rose amid considerable excite
ment. The Cabinet will meet to-morrow
morning, and it is rumored that General
Pellieux will tender the resignation of the
Ministry to King Humbert. General Pel
lieux went to the Quirinal this evening
and reported the situation to King Hum
bert. 7V<7-
The scene in the chamber when Signor
Crispi rebuked Admiral Canavero for di
vulging state documents was very dra
matic. "We are giving with light hearts."
said Signor ("rlspi, "a sorry spectacle to
Europe. I ask the Chamber to cease this
discussion." â¢â â ''.
The Deputies treated Signor Crispi with
extraordinary deference, several rising
and exclaiming. "He is our only man."
As. three-fourths of the Deputies are
likely to vote against the Government, it
is believed that General Pellieux has de-
cided to repeat a strategem often employ
ed by Marquis di Rudini and to resign
forthwith, in which case King Humbert
will probably invite him to reconstruct
the Cabinet.
FINED FOR HAVING
STRUCK JAKE RAUER
SAN RAFAEL, May 2.â John Quinn, the
turfman, pleaded guilty to a charge of
simple assault in Justice of the Peace
Rodden's court this morning and was
fined $25. Quinn was charged with hav
ing assaulted Jake Raver. the San Fran
cisco collection agent, on the Tiburon
ferry-boat two weeks ago. The difficulty
between the men arose from an attempt
by Raver to collect a bill due the Bald
win Hotel. It came out at the trial that
the bill was owed by Charles Quinn. a
brother of the defendant, who is at pres
ent in the East.
All the Quinns looked alike to Raver
and he tackled the wrong man In a street
car, demanding payment of the account.
Quinrt was escorting some ladies to the
racetrack at the time, which prevented
him giving full expression to his resent
ment. The next time he met Raver was
on the Tiburon ferry, when he planted his
fist on the collection agent's forehead,
knocking him down.
Raver arrived at the courtroom to-day
just as Quinn was satisfying the fine Im
posed by the court. He was much dis
gruntled that the fine was so low and
heaped anathemas upon the head of the
court and officers, He wanted the trial
to go on, claiming that imprisonment
alone could avenge the punishment he re
ceived from the racing man.

Honduras and Nicara-
qua to Be Taught
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 2â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: There is reason to believe
that the administration proposes to use
the Pears case and the Bluefields inci
dents to compel respect for the United
States in Honduras and Nicaragua,
While it is assumed that the Govern
ments of Honduras and Nicaragua
wish to act fairly, their subordinates
have been guilty of petty persecutions
of American citizens which, in many
instances, cannot be made the subject
of official complaint. A letter written
to the State Department last week by
a resident of Honduras shows the
character of the treatment accorded to
Americans in that country, and com
munications from Americans in Nica
ragua indicate that they are subject
ed to all manner of petty annoyances.
The State Department is therefore de
termined to bring the Hondurans and
Nicaraguans to account.
With this object in view the proposi
tion of the Honduras Government that
the Pears case be referred to arbitra
tion has been rejected and Minister
Hunter has been instructed to press
for an immediate settlement.
Should the $10,000 indemnity demand
ed be not forthcoming within a reason
able time a squadron will be ordered
to Honduras to enforce payment.
In the Bluefields matter the authori
ties are determined that General Torres
shall be removed and American citi
zens there shall not pay the double
assessment ordered.
On the part of the Navy Department,
cause of complaint against Nicaragua
arises out of the failure to get two ca
blegrams to Commander Dayton, com
manding the Detroit, now at Bluefields.
Similar trouble was experienced some
months ago in the case of the gunboat
Marietta, and the Detroit was sent to
Bluefields to make an investigation. At
that time President Zeyala denied
there had been any international stop
page of messages, and the matter was
finally dropped. The authorities are
much annoyed at the repetition of the
trouble, and steps will be taken to pre
vents its reoccurrence.
Frank Pears, a United States citizen
of Pittsburg, Pa., was killed by a sentry
at San Pedro Sula during the revolu
tionary uprising cm February 2 last. A
dispatch to the Herald from Washing
ton on April 17 last said that the United
States Government had demanded $10,
--000 indemnity for the heirs of Pears, the
Honduras Government having allowed
his murderer, who was a soldier, to
escape, justice by going into the in
terior. Minister Hunter was instructed
to demand indemnity and the punish
ment of the murderer.
, The Bluefields incident referred to is
the demand of General Torres, Presi
dent Zelaya's representative, that
American merchants should again pay
import duties for which they already
had been taxed by General Reyes, the
recent revolutionary leader, while he
was in power.
Outlaw to Act as Lawyer.
AUSTIN, Tex., May 2.â Charles Beeler,
who is in jail at San Antonio, charged
with the robbing of the Wells-Fargo Ex
press of $60,000 In coin, refuses to employ
an attorney and Bay? he will present his
own case when it comes to trial. He has
asked the court to grant him an immedi
ate trial. He still refuses to divulge the
hiding place of the stolen money.

MINERS RUSHING
TO KRAMER CAMP
Special Dispatch to Thp Call.
RANDSBURG. May 2â Not since the
free milling gold strike by Burcham,
Singleton and Moore at what is now
Randsburg, in April, 1895, has there
been such excitement among miners
on the Mojave desert as the news of
gold strikes ten miles southeast of
Kramer has created in the last week.
Indeed, men who have lived out here
among the bold and bleak mountains
if the painted desert say there has not
been such general excitement because
of new ore rinds since the day.s of the
Calico silver discovery, nineteen ears
ago. After unusual secrecy by th*- dis
coverers of the Kramer mines for four
months, information concerning the
richness of the finds leaked out on
April 22, and forthwith the rush for
Kramer began from all of the little
mining camps from hachapi to the
Colorado River. This week the rush is
greater than ever, and before Sunday
it probably will comprise hundreds of
men. Miners on horseback, on foot, on
the Santa Fe Railroad trains and in
wagons are going into the Kramer
camp by scores daily, notwithstanding
the coldest and windiest May weather
known in years. Last night over 400
men slept under blankets amid grease T
wood chaparral on the desolate foot
hills around Kramer and to-night there
will be more there.
For over a year Albert S. Clarke,
Dixon Duncan and Robert Goldsberry
have been drywashing for gold among
the desert foothills in that locality.
They are old soldiers of fortune and
have had twenty-two years' experience
among the Southern California mines.
Last November they found drywashing
ore near Krai that paid them $30
daily. They agreed to keep their suc
cess a strict secret.
While they conducted their dry
washing they prospected for ledges. In
January they found them. No human
being was within ten miles and they
kept their work secret among them
selves. Meanwhile they have been lo
cating twelve claims on the richest ore
and in localities most advantageous to
themselves; and have sunk shaft: and
crosscuts to reveal the formation of
the ore bed. These miners have been
shipping their drywashed gold to San
Francisco from four different Santa Fe
Railroad stations in order to let no one
know what wealth they were digging.
However, when they sent $2200 worth
of gold from Barstow last week the
secret got out and the rush to Kramer
began.
C. A. Burcham, the millionaire miner
of Randsburg, has mining prospectors
locating claims at Kramer. He says
the Kramer camp will be second to
Randsburg. D. A. Douglas, who has
been a mining expert for the De la Mar
Company of I'tah, says the Kramer
gold strike is the more wonderful be
cause of the peculiarity of its ore. No
such gold ore ever was found in Amer
ica before. It is quartzite, porphyry
and quartz proper. It assays all the
way from $I."* to $600. The vein is. twen
ty feet wide, but In some localities Its
width is over thirty feet. The ledge
may be traced for four or five miles.
W. C. "Woodward, who has charge of
the Randsburg Hallway, has seven
claims there. Shafts on two of them
are down twenty feet and the ore runs
from $6 to $20 a ton from the grass
Boots. 11. R. Bacon, who was first on
the camp last week, has seen Dixon
Duncan horn $4 in gold from a pail of
ore from his claim there.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAT 3, 1899.
WILL CONTROL
THE CANNERIES
OF THE STATE
A New Combination of
Fruit-Packers.
TO MAKE A STEADY MARKET
THREE LARGE CONCERNS ARE
STILL HOLDING OUT.
The Corporation Will Endeavor to
Minimiza the Cost of Production
by Effecting Sweeping
i Changes.
Articles of incorporation were filed yes
terday for the California Packers' Asso-
elation, with a capital of two and a half
million dollars.
The new concern is composed of some
of the largest fruit-packing establish
ments In the State and Its object will be
to control and regulate the prices of
canned fruits. It will also ship goods to
all parts of the world. It is organised on
practically the same lines as the Alaska
Packers' Association, and the members
hep-: to be able to minimize the cost of
preparing fruit for shipment and thus
dictate prices.
Under the plan agreed upon it is prob
able that some factories will be closed
altogether and others which now can
fruits of all kinds will limit their output
to a single variety. For instance, facto
ries In cherry-growing districts are now
canning net only cherries but peaches,
pears and apricots. The fruits not raised
In that particular district must be
shipped to the country* often at great ex
pense. After having been canned they
must be reshipped to the point of distri
bution, which may be in the neighborhood
where they were grown. It is the plan of
the corporation i" save this. double ship
ping bill by treating each variety of
fruit in the. portion of the State where it
grows in largest quantities.
The new concern held a meeting yes
terday afternoon and organized with the
election of the following directors: A. D.
Cutler of the Cutting Fruit Packing Com
pany; M. .1. Fontana of Fontana & Co.;
E. 11. Nielson, California Preserving
Company; I". Tillmann Jr., Oakland Pre

& Co.; W. H. Wright, San Jose Packing
Company; W. J. Hotvhkiss, Russian Riv
er Packing Company; James Madison, A.
F. Tenny Company; J. Streining, Rose
City Canning Company.
The concerns which have not entered
Into the combination are the Southern
California Packing Company, the Pacific
Cannery Company and the California
Canneries Company.

The Charge Against
an Attorney.
STRANGLER SUSPECT TALKS
GRAND JURY WILL BE ASKED
TO INVESTIGATE.
Harry Wilson, the Negro, Sentenced
to Eighteen .Months in the
County Jail for Petty
Larceny.
Harry Wilson, the suspected strangler.
who jumped his bonds and was captured
at Santa Cruz, was taken before Judge
Graham yesterday morning to be tried
on the three charges of petty larceny
booked against him. Detectives Ed Gib
son. Wren and McMahon' had In readiness
the three women to testify against him
and others who would have corroborated
their statements, as some of them had
also been victims in the same* way. Wil
son did not put them to the trouble of
testifying, as he pleaded guilty to each
charge, although declaring he was not
guilty on one.
The Judge at once sentenced him to six
months in the County Jail on each charge,
making eighteen months altogether. Af
ter receiving his sentence he asked per
mission to speak to the Judge. He told
the Judge that he was not so bad as he
had been painted and was not cognizant
of the serious crimes which suspicion had
pointed at him. He then said that he had
given Attorney .1. N. E. Wilson $300 to get
him out of th*- City Prison and the attor
ney had told him that the case would be
squared and he need not make his appear
ance in court. He did not know anything
about the bondsmen; all he cared for was
to get his liberty, and he was willing to
pay the $300 for it.
Before court opened yesterday morning
Attorney Wilson made a request at the
chiefs office to see the negro, but was
told that he did not want to see him.
Captain Seymour was persuaded to go
with Attorney Wilson to the prison, and
tin- negro was called out. The negro was
sullen and flatly accused the attorney of
getting the $300 in three $100 hills to get
him out and have the case squared.
Attorney Wilson denied that he got a
cent from the negro, and angrily said:
"Did I not tell you to be in court the next
morning?"
The negro retorted: "No, you did not.
You told me to get out of the city, as the
police expected a Spanish woman from
Panama who would make a serious
charge against me, and I told you that
I did not know anything about a Spanish
woman."
Attorney Wilson again mad.- denial of
getting the money, ami said all he got
was an order on the property clerk for $23
which was in Wilson's pockets when ar
rested.
"Well." said the negro, "it is a negro s
word against a white man's; that's all."
Tie- negro repeated the same story to
Chief Bees and hinted that he had wit
nesses who would prove that he was
right The Chief will lay the matter be
fore the Grand Jury, so that the whole
nauseous business can be probed to the
bottom. __________________
WILL BUILD A NEW
HOME OF VAUDEVILLE
ED FISCHER TO ERECT A HAND-
SOME THEATER.
The Proprietor of the Oberon Is
About to Engage in an Ambi
tious Amusement Venture.
Two hundred thousand dollars Is about
to be Invested in the construction of a
new theater In San Francisco. The pro
moter of the enterprise is Ed Fischer,
proprietor of the Oberon, and the location
chosen for the new playhouse is on O'Far
rell street, adjoining the Alcazar.
For some time contractors have been
at work on the premises. A large three
story building was removed and excava
tion has been made for a basement. The
plans were submitted to contractors yes
terday by the architects, and their esti
mates will i"- finished to-day. Fischer
will push the work with all possible
speed, and by October the doors will be
thrown open to the public.
Vaudeville will till the bills.
For this class of theatricals the plans
will differ somewhat from other specialty
showhouses. There will be three galleries
and a graduated scale of admission prices.
The pit, however, will be built on the or
dinary plan. In general appearance it
will resemble the Tivoli. only its seating
capacity will be much greater. The speci
fications call for a building of 50 feet
frontage and 137:6 feet deep. The cost will
be great, but Fischer says he expects to
realize handsomely on this investment.

GAS BILLS ARE
RENDERED AT
SAME OLD RATE
Issue Has Not,, as Yet,
Been Forced.
$1 75 IS STILL THE CHARGE
CONSUMERS DO NOT PROFIT BY
RECENT LEGISLATION.
Officials of the Gas Company Affirm
That They Will Never Agree
to the $1 10
Rate.
The hills of the Ran Francisco Gas and
Electric Company for April are due and
will be presented to consumers as rapid
ly as the clerical force of the corporation
can handle them. The rate for which they
will be rendered is Jl 77 per thousand cu
bic feet, the same charge that has been
made for years.
According to Mayor Phelan the com
pany is not entitled to that rate for its
products, as on the 3d of last month the
Supervisors fixed $1 10 as the rate to be
charged the householders. The board re-.
scinded, or endeavored to rescind, this
action afterward, hut his Honor the May
or holds the law does not countenance
such action and that the $1 10 rate must
stand for one year. He takes this posi
tion on a section of the consolidation act,
which provides that rat can be fixed but
once a year. Having acted in the matter
once the board cannot review Its work.
Up to th*- present time no one has ap
peared on the scene ready to force the
issue .-.mi determine the rights of the peo
ple and of the gas company in the prem
ises. The officials of tin company affirm
they have not decided upon the course
they will pursue, but are awaiting the
advice of their attorneys as to the law
bearing on the case, it is thought some
thing may develop at any time that will
take the case Into the courts for them to
pass upon.
Attorney William Rix, who is one of the
legal advisers of the company, in discuss
ing the situation yesterday said: "The
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company
will never agree to accept the rat of
$1 10 per thousand cubic feet. This is
not fair compensation for the service sup
plied. We have two points upon which
to base our fight. First. that the Supervis
ors have no right to fix rates and sec
ond, that if they have the right they have
rescinded their action naming $1 10 as the
amount to be charged. We believe the
latter contention will hold in law. hence
no rate has been fixed by the present
Board of Supervisors and th.- old rate
obtains. The company will not do any
thing wrong, illegal or unjust."
President Crockett said â  the bills for
April an- being made out at the old rate
and that up to th*- present time no one
was objecting very hard. "They know
the company is here and is responsible."
he said, "and whatever rate is finally de
termined upon as th.- legal one the con
sumers will lose nothing. We await our
attorneys' advice in the matter before we
take any steps. They are going thorough
ly int.. the law of th.- case and our direc
tors will be governed by their advice."
.Mr. Crockett Would not discuss the re
duction in price of gas in New Fork on
Monday from $1 10 per thousand cubic
feet to"f*s cents." "1 do not know what the
conditions are In New York." said Mr.
Crockett. "It seems to be a tight between
the different companies and the price
asked for seems to have no relation to
th.- cost of production. It could not prop
erly he hold to he a parallel case to that
in this city."
As the matter stands the rate as fixed
by the Supervisors is $1 l" and this is the

ANTIOCH GUN CLUBS
ARE GETTING READY
SEVENTH TOURNAMENT OF THE
TARGET ASSOCIATION.
Men From All Parts of the State Will
Meet in Competition at the An
nual Festival.
Trap shooting is now one of the lead
ing outdoor sporting features which has
numerous supporters in all parts of the
State. â  -b
Four years ago a few enthusiastic
sportsmen in different parts of th.- coun
try, desiring to develop the trap shoot
ing skill of individuals and to promote
acquaintance and good fellowship among
sportsmen, met and organized the Cali
fornia Inanimate Target Association. Un
der its auspices six successful trap shoot
ing tournaments have been held at San
Francisco, Stockton, Alameda. San Jose
and Monterey. Now the seventh tourna
ment, which promises to eclipse in every
particular all previous tournaments, will
be held at Antloch on the 29th and 30th of
this month.
The programme of individual events
will provide for five twenty-bird races
each day. Class shooting is to prevail
and a trophy is to be provided as the
first-class prize in every event and the
prize money will be divided between the
successful competitors in the four classes.
Heretofore it has been the custom where
four moneys were given to allow 40 per
cent to the first class, 'â 'â <) per cent to sec
ond class, 20 per cent to third class and
.10 per cent to fourth class. But this year
the old way of doing businessâ that is. in
segregating tin- money In prizesâ ls to be
reversed, so that 10 per cent will go to
the first class, 20 to the second class. 30
to the third class and 40 to the fourth
class. Th.- philosophy of this division is
t.i place the greatest amount of money
where there will be th.- greatest number
of men to share its division.
The trophies to be shot for this year are
very valuable and handsome. The Roos
"three-man team" trophy will be con
tested for at Antloch for the third time,
and this promises to be one of the hotest
races of the tournament. A new trophy
will ,be provided for the "six-man teams'*
and th*- usual cash prises will be given
for high averages. Decorations will also
be provided for the best two averages be
tween SO and 90 per cent, three for the
best three averages between 70 and 80 per
cent and four for the best four averages

McGLADE IS ON TRIAL.
His Counsel Making a Technical
Fight for His Liberty.
The trial of Peter McGlade, ex-hook
keeper of the Street Superintendent's of
fice, charged with forging demands on the
treasury, opened before Judge Cook yes
terday morning. McGlade was put on trial
for the specific crime charged to him of
forging a warrant for $96. purporting to
be the demand of one H. Swords for labor
performed on behalf of the city. Ex-Su
perintendent of Streets Ambrose was put
upon the stand and testified that McGlade
was employed in his oilice at the time the
alleged crimes were committed Swords
then took the stand and said that at the
time of the forgery of the warrant he
was not employed by the city, consequent
ly could make no demand on the city. At
this point the prosecution endeavored to
introduce the forged . document in evi
dence, and here the technical fight began.
Patrick Red. ly objected to the introduc
tion of the document on various grounds,
and in order to argue the points raised
the Jury was dismissed until this morn
ing, at which time Judge Cook will rule
on the merits of the points raised.
Polite attendants will be on duty all day
and evening to answer questions and dem
onstrate its value. Everybody invited to

more. Other suits for damages for the
alienation of the wife's affections, it is
said, will soon be filed; ami the family
troubles of the Dlnmores will be thor
oughly aired in tin- courts. Up to a few
months ago Mr. and Mrs. Dlnmore lived
happily in a pretty home at 2117 Webster
street. A few mouths ago society was set
a-gossiping when Mrs. Dlnmore filed suit
lor divorce, alleging cruelty as a cause of
complaint. The cruelty alleged in the
complaint resulted solely in mental suf
fering; it was set forth, through Mi. 1 Â»in
more's dislike for his f;:inily-in-l<iw and
habit <*f ordering relatives nut nf the
house.
In tho complaint tiled yesterday Mr.
Dlnmore sots forth that a shnrt time ago
lie was called East on business. While in
the East his family-ln-law Invaded his
home and when lie returned they had
taken his wife from him to their home in
Petalumai They poisoned his wife's mind
against him. Mr. Dinmore alleges, through
false and malicious stories and thereby
robbed lum of the comfort of his family
and w recked his home.
_\lr. Dinmore's wrath is specially great
again.-: his brother and sister-in-law. for
it is through their influence, he contends,
that he lost his wife. As for his wife he
has naught but sympathy, though he
keenly feels the publicity of the family
troubles occasioned by the filing of the
.- :: f : divorce. The tiling of the suit for
damagi s will open tho door of investtga

opinions lie will sunn find the cause that

AT THE THEATERS.
Miss Burkhart's performance of "My
Aunt's Advice" at the Orpheum was
reviewed in yesterday's Call.
The best of the newcomers are the
Sisters Hawthorne^ who do two com-
tnonplace music hall ditties with change
61 â  stume and then prise their au
ditor? by appearing in Japanese ki
monos and singing "The Willow Pat
tern Plate" to a scenic accompaniment
that carries out most artistically the
willow pattern idea. They sing the
eong with a harming archness, and
the scenery is really novel and beauti
ful. Three plump, sturdy girls and one
lively thin one by the name of the Nel
son Sisters do some acrobatic work
that the tougher sex rrfight be proud
to do. and the Valderes have a graceful
unci difficult bicycle act. Altogether
the show is much more ' Â»rpheum-llke
than last week, when It was saved from
absolute mediocrity only by Miss Burk

A footrace at Pleasanton last week
is the cause of it all, for Delaney and

â with bills. They camp back with the
pouches and the wallets.
A few weeks ago a wise man ap-
proached Delaney and whispered in
his right ear something about a
chance to make big money without
losing any flesh. Delaney winked
both eyes and listened with both ears.
It was too good, so he told his friends
about his prospective good fortune.

Holders Will Be Let Off as Lightly
as May Be Consistent With
the Good of the Service.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
has notified Internal Revenue Collector
Lynch that it being apparent that the
holders of cigars stamped with the coun
terfeit revenue stamps, with which the
country was flooded by an enterprising
firm in Pennsylvania, were innocent of
wrong intent, they will he dealt with ns
lightly as may ho consistent with the
good of the service, the t.olleetor havinc:
requested that such a course be pursued.
The cigars will ho returned to the persons
from whom they were taken, on the pay
ment by them of the sum necessary to
replace th*- counterfeit stamps with good
ones, and of a nominal fine, presumably
for. the purpose of sharpening their eye

sprinter that over put on the spikes.
Tho wise man had programmed the
affair to a nicety. He had persuaded
a number of Stockton men that they
might have money to sell If they
would make a match with their favor
ite sprinter, whose nnm de guerre is
Gibson. All that was required of
them was their presence in Pleasan
ton on the day fixed with pouches
and wallets.
The sprinter who was to win the
boodle for the local sports was
brought to this city, and he did mar
velous work at the Olympic Club
track. The local contingent couldn't
lose. They left on Tuesday night for
the scene of pedal strife. On the train
the sprinter and the rest made things
lively for a while, until he of the
spikes found it necessary to go into
another car, as the smoke was crawl
ing down his lungs and he feared for
his wind. This was a good sign of
earnestness, and the San Francisco
contingent admired the honesty of
their principal.
At Pleasanton the Stockton crowd
met the local force and gave them
assistance in deporting the empty
pouches which the latter had brought
to pack off the money of the former.
The race was run on Friday morning,
and it was as pretty a race as any
sportsman could hope for. The bet
ting was brisk, the local band having
brought about $2000 to the track. Mc-
Henery held the stakes and Fred
Vetter was a judge. The San Fran
cisco idol took the lend In the first
ten yards: then the Stockton wonder
forged ahead and set the pace. About
the sixth second. San Francisco was
in the lead again and country money
was on its way to the metropolis.
Just then something happened which
Delaney docs not care to describe.
Stockton won by an inch.
The sprinters did not stop running
when they finished their ; 100-yard
course. The San Francisco man kept
moving right along until he reached
a buggy, which moved him further
along and out of the way of a great
wrath. The Stockton people became
suddenly jubilant and the San Fran
cisco contingent began looking for
rifles. But their spike wonder was a
hummer, and he ran the race of his
life, It would have been his last had
they caught him, which they did not.
Let no man ask John Delaney if he
has pouches for sale.

I ceived another severe fall at Oakland

! In the seven-furlong event, fifth on the
I card, the chestnut horse became afflicted
i with his old habit of bleeding and fell on
j the back stretch, near the flve furlong

running. Suddenly his mount was Been
to falter and fall back, then fall. Bull
man was at first supposed to be badly In
jured, but an examination developed the
fact that he had escaped with some
bruises and a shaking up.
The programme was not an enticing one,
attracting a small crowd. Three favorites
were bowled over.
A big field of seventeen platers started
in the first event, a five furlong scramble.
Bill Dingley, the Montana rider, had the
mount on i Don't Know, against which
sprinter 12 to 1 was laid, and In a fierce
drive with Madrone earned the verdict

no speed whatever.
The chestnut colt Roy Hooker ruled a
pronounced favorite in the betting

was outfooted from the start. Holme;,

was neared, when he was passed and led
out by Bullman, astride Jennie Reid,

Track Notes.
This will be the closing day of the Cali
fornia Jockey Club's season of racing. A
Darktown derby will be the feature of the
card.
Hahn, a well-developed specimen of the
"genus pinhead," which flourish in pro
fusion on racetracks, was fined $25 by the
judges for boating The Plunger over the
head with his whip.
Presiding Judge Murphy departed for
St. Louis last evening, where he will have
the same position at the Fair Grounds.

THE BUG IN THE CHARTER.
\A R. HENRY X. CLEMENT and Dr. E. R.
/ \ Taylor are able and reputable lawyers. In
* * The Call of Sunday these gentlemen as
signed two reasons for the failure to provide in the
new charter for the regulation of the rates and
charges of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany, and for the discrimination between that cor
poration and other monopolies, classified as common
carriers. One of these reasons is the doubtful con
stitutionality of such municipal legislation, and the
other the supposed intermixture of the business of
the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, which
is a local concern, with the service of the Sunset Tele
phone and Telegraph Company, extending to all parts
of the State:
It is not the function of the press to determine c0n
..... T , , , , ,
stttutional questions. It had been supposed, however,
â â .â â .â â â .-â â â â ..-â â â  â  â 
that there could be no doubt of the power of State
regulation m the particulars mentioned, and that the
only point in controversy was the existence of this
right in the municipality, either by express specifica
tion or under the implications of the law. We have
not before us any direct adjudication on the subject,
but in the American Law Review for April-May, 1896,
a very able opinion by one of the most prominent
lawyers in Kansas was published, in which the rights
of State control and of the delegation of municipal
control over telephone companies was vigorously as
serted. In Massachusetts also, perhaps in other
*v* : 'yy . â  _.
States, the same views are entertained. It seems that
all monopolies or even competitive associations, de
pending upon franchises or privileges derived from
the public, should be subject to restrictions in their
exactions and should not be permitted equally to
plunder the community at large and their private cus
tomers.
This municipality has its regular legal adviser, to
whom the constitutional question should be promptly
committed. If the State constitution as it exists
manacles the Legislature in dealing with telephone
companies it should be amended. We do not believe
that there is any such limitation. The other point
suggested by Mr. Clement and Dr. Taylor can hardly
be sustained. There can be no doubt that the State
â¢
jurisdiction of the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph
Company and the municipal jurisdiction of the Pacific
Telephone and Telegraph Company are clearly dis
tinguishable. To a certain extent they may use the
same wires and the same instruments. But it is well
understood that the identity of each corporation is
separately maintained, that each service is independent
of the other, that the accounts are not commingled,
and that it is entirely practicable to treat the business
of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company as
distinct and complete within itself.
The existence of this bug in the new charter, to
which The Call has invited the attention of the pub
lic and of the municipal authorities, is unquestion
able. The constitutional doubt should have been re
solved in favor of the people and not of the telephone
monopoly. There should be no delay or hesitation
in the exercise of lawful means to compel its submis
sion to reasonable supervision over its tariff and to
some recognition of the interests of its customers.
These monopolies, in alliance with the railroad, have
virtually held themselves above the law in this State
and have treated the public with contempt. It is time
to make them understand that the American people
live under a free Government and not under a private
despotism.
In their efforts to distribute prize money to the
Cubans the American authorities are having a great
deal of trouble with "swollen" lists of insurgent
Cub m soldiers. When the American Government
needed Cuban soldiers in the war with Spain the list
of available and willing men was lamentably small.
From the tenor of British comment on Coghlan's
speech it seems the opinion over there is that he
ought to be deprived of his rank as captain, retired
for about a couple of weeks and then restored to the
navy as a commodore.
Senator Butler of North Carolina is said to have
enrolled himself as a student in the law school of the
university of the State, which shows that the Senatot,
though a Populist, has sense enough to see that he
can never learn any law in the Senate.
The emissaries of Aguinaldo want to retire from
their rebellion with honor. Thus far they have retired
flora the advance of the American troops with haste,
It is rather late in the campaign for them to change
their policy.
It is cheering to hear that the Emperor William
has joined in the gayety of nations. He has just read
and apparently enjoyed "Hoch der Kaiser 1"
The report that Aguinaldo is of Irish parentage on
his father's side accounts for his excellence as a
.fighter, but where did he get that name?
APPOINTED SENATORS.
SENATOR PERKINS, in discussing the seating
of Senators who are appointed by the execu
tive,' says he may be criticized for his present
I position because he voted to seat Corbett of Oregon.
' The first case decided by the Senate was that
of Kensey Johns, appointed by the Governor
of Delaware in 1794, after a legislative ses
sion had been held subsequent to the occur
rence of the vacancy. The Senate held that the
Legislature having met, the Governor took no juris
diction by its failure to elect a Senator. Up to this
time this rule has been adhered to. The issue raised
in the Corbett case, however, was new. A careful
study of the discussion proves this plainly. The
case was stated by Senator Spooner of Wisconsin, an
able lawyer. It turned on what constitutes "a meet
ing" of the Legislature. The Legislature of Oregon
met and the Senate organized permanently for the
transaction of business. The House never reached
even a temporary organization, but met from day to
day without a quorum, in a futile effort to get a
quorum and permanently organize. In this way the
time allotted to the session passed away without the
transaction of any legislative business, and, of course,
without notice to the Governor that the Legislature
was in session at all, since the official notification to
him of that fact by committee never occurred. The
issue in the Corbett case, then, was. Does such a
gathering of the members elected to the Legislature
constitute a meeting of that body within the legal and
constitutional meaning?
Senator Spooner said: "The constitution has de
volved that Federal function (election of a Senator)
upon the Legislature of a State. So it is but a step
to argue, and the conclusion is inevitable, that
there is no jurisdiction under the constitution
of the United States to perform this Federal
function until, by compliance with the consti
tution of the State and the law of the State,
there exists an organized legislative body, consti
tuting a Legislature capable of legislating. So it was,
at the suggestion of Mr. Fessenden, in 1866, that the
present law was passed as we find it in the statutes to
day, containing the words, 'meeting and organization
of the Legislature.' Now, what is the 'organization'
of a Legislature? I looked at Anderson's Law Dic
tionary this morning and it says: 'In the sense of to
constitute, to qualify for the exercise of appropriate
functions. It may refer to a government, a court, a
legislative body, a board of deputies or other officers.'
"If there is a quorum of sworn members in each
House, who have elected a Speaker or a President
pro tempore, who have provided themselves with fa
cilities for expressing and recording the legislative
will, who have clothed themselves by a performance
of conditions precedent with the power to legislate, so
that they may pass laws which will be valid and bind
ing, a rule of action upon the people of the State,
even though they may not have been able to elect a
permanent Speaker they should be taken as a Legisla
ture within the constitutional sense and qualified to
choose a Senator." ,
The Oregon House consists of sixty members. The
constitution of the State requires that two-thirds of
each House shall constitute a quorum to do busi-
ness, but a smaller number may meet and compel at
tendance of absentees and adjourn from day to day.
Observe the language, "may" â not "must" nor
"shall" â compel attendance of absentees. At the first
meeting of the House thirty-four were present and
twenty-six absent. When the roll was called thirty
responded and thirty were absent. So it continued
from day to day, the highest number responding to
rollcall being thirty-one. There was not even a tem
porary organization, no temporary Speaker was
elected, and only thirty-one of the sixty members were
even sworn in.
Senator Spooner's argument that this did not con
stitute ''a meeting and organization of the Legisla
ture" was perfectly correct, and his deduction there
from that the Legislature not having met and organ
ized the Governor had not lost jurisdiction of the
Senatorial appointment was highly plausible and
justifiable. But, observe that very argument was a
complete admission that if the Legislature had met
and had organized and had then failed to elect a Sen
ator the Governor's jurisdiction would have been lost.
Therefore, in voting to seat Corbett Senator Perkins
remained in line with the adjudicated cases of Johns
and Lanman, and his vote was not inconsistent with
his present position. The doctrine of the constitution
is that the Governor takes jurisdiction only when the
vacancy occurs during a recess of the Legislature,
that such jurisdiction ceases upon the meeting and or
ganization of the Legislature and does not return to
the Governor upon legislative failure to exercise it.
It was plausibly held in the Corbett case, in line
with the foregoing doctrine, that the Governor's juris
diction remains intact if the Legislature fail to "or
ganize."
As we have said before, the whole matter is so
plain that it needs no lawyer to state it. The Legis
latures of California, Utah, Delaware and Pennsyl
vania had met, organized and were in session transact
ing legislative business, and the executives were offi
cially notified and cognizant thereof when the vacan
cies occurred in the Senate by expiration of the
regular terms. Therefore jurisdiction was never in
the Governors of those States, but was originally in
the Legislatures and remains there until 'the Legis
latures choose to exercise it.
Th|E PEACE CONGRESS.
WHILE we have welcomed May this year not
with a festival of rejoicing over the return of
the season of flowers, but with the celebration
of a great epoch-making victory, the month will not
be lacking in- more peaceful suggestions, for its chief
event will be the gathering of the international con
ference called by the Czar to consider the possibility
of bringing about a general disarmament of the
nations.
The conference is to open at The Hague on the
18th and every civilized nation on the globe will be
represented among its members. The delegates from
this country will be Andrew D. White, Embassador
to Germany; Stanford Newel, Minister to the Neth
erlands; Professor Seth Low of Columbia Univer
sity; Captain Crozier of the United States army, and
Captain Mahan of the navy. The American commis
sion as a whole is regarded as an exceptionally strong
body, several of its members being men of interna
tional reputation.
It is not expected that much of a positive nature
will be accomplished by the conference, for no dele
gation is to be empowered to do or to promise any
thing which will be binding upon its Government. It
is to be a meeting for discussion merely, and from the
tone of the comment on the subject in diplomatic
circles it is doubtful if the Czar's suggestion of gen
eral^ disarmament will be given much more than a
perfunctory consideration.
Nevertheless there is a strong belief the discussions
at the meeting will result in materially strengthening
the cause of peace. It is said the United States and
Great Britain will unite in urging an international
agreement that private property shall in times of war
be respected on sea as on land, and will also advo
TILE SAJS FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1899.
cate a more general adoption of arbitration as a
means of settling international disputes.
The notable feature of the conference will be the
part the United States will play in it. For the first
time an American delegation will sit in a great Euro
pean council and be respected as the representative of
a world power of the first class. Of course American
sentiment with respect to disarmament will have little
weight, since that issue does not affect us. We have
no heavy armaments to menace Europe, neither do
the armaments of European nations menace us; but
on all other questions the expression of the Ameri
can Commissioners will be given as much attention
as is paid to those of any other power.
It is generally believed in â  Europe that after the
conference at The Hague is over there will be a meet
ing of the greater rulers of Europe in England, at
which time the recommendations of the conference
will be reviewed and possibly some agreement may
be reached which will strengthen that famous "con
cert of Europe," which has now become an established
institution of diplomacy. Under any circumstances
the peace conference is likely to be the most impor
tant event of the year, and its proceedings will be
studied closely by all who are interested in the wel
fare of nations and the prosperity of mankind.
UNDER our free institutions the people make the
laws, subject only to essential constitutional re
strictions. The enforcement of the law, there
fore, is guaranteed by a compact between the people
themselves, which cannot be disregarded without
vital danger to the republic.
The Call has uniformly insisted that the Federal
constitution and the State constitutions/ and all the
laws made in pursuance thereof should be rigidly
observed. It has applied this obviously correct doc
trine without evasion or partiality. It has demanded
its application to its own party and to the Federal
administration. It has denounced Asiatic expansion
and imperialism, because the one is a substantial
equivalent for the other and both are repugnant to
constitutional obligations and also to the theory and
the practice of our Government. While recognizing
the terrible provocations in the South, it has uni-.
formly resisted the cruelties of mobs and declared
that crime should be punished through the courts,
whether perpetrated by brutalized negroes or by re
vengeful whites. It has antagonized monopoly in
every form that has raised it above the law or enabled
it to strike at the rights and the interests of the pub
lic, whether represented by oppressive trusts or wield
ing dictatorial power through an individual, as in the
case of C. P. Huntington.
The scenes in Idaho, which have been depicted
vividly in our columns, show the evil example and the
viciousness of unrepressed lawlessness. In the most
wanton manner, without excuse or palliation, valuable
and wealth-producing property has been destroyed
and hundreds â perhaps thousands of industrious
citizens at least temporarily deprived of employment.
The crime is as deadly to labor as it is to capital.
Equality before the law does not mean an aristocracy
of violence any more than it means an aristocracy of
fraud or greed. It does mean the same law and the
same administration of the law for the rich and the
poor alike, and that all men of every condition, living
in the United States and possessed of the inestimable
and inalienable rights of American citizenship, or
whose presence among us is tolerated, shall be com
pelled to live in peace and in order, in conformity
with the necessities of civilized society, and shall not
attempt to steal their neighbor's goods, to injure his
body, to take his life, nor forcibly to redress their own
grievances.
Mob law spreads like an epidemic. It must be
dealt with dispassionately and temperately, but with
inexorable firmness and promptness. If General Otis
is justified in refusing to treat with the Filipinos un
til they have unconditionally surrendered, there is
much greater necessity for the refusal to temporize
with outlaws in an established American State upon
this continent. Lawless combinations of miners at
Wardner are quite as destructive and inexcusable as
aggressive and fraudulent combinations of capital in
San Francisco or in New York.
UNIVERSITY REORGANIZATION.
T F the report so widely circulated be true that- East-
IF the authorities consulted upon the that- East
ern authorities consulted upon the selection
of a new president for the State University have
advised that upon the close of the first academic year
after the new man enters upon his work all the pro
fessors and heads of departments in the university
shall resign so as to leave him free to reorganize the
institution, then the Regents are certainly wise in
deliberating well and long before they act. A whole
sale reorganization and reconstitution of the univer
sity staff may be attractive, but it will be a hazardous
experiment to carry out.
The claim is made by those who favor the rumored
plan that there are in the university some professors
who should never have been appointed and some who
have grown old in the service and are no longer use
ful. The elimination of these, it is said, would be of
great benefit to the institution. New men would
mean new vigor, new energy and a new. and more
vitalizing stimulus to the university in all lines of its
work.
Even if all that is claimed were sure to be accom
plished beyond a shadow of a doubt, there would still
be serious objections to anything like a wholesale
sweeping of the university by an Eastern broom after
but one year of experience in the State. It would be
demoralizing to university life if each change in the
presidency should mean a wholesale change in the
professorships and the teaching body generally.
Under such conditions a university career would be
almost as uncertain as one in politics, and a professor
in future would have to give a good deal of time and
energy to the work of wire-pulling among the powers
that be in order to hold his position after attaining it.
The great universities of Europe and the East have
not become centers of learning and noted as the
homes of scholarship by any practice of turning pro
fessors out of their chairs simply because they have
grown old in service, or because they arc not "up
to date" according to the ideas of some new head of
the institution.
There is no need for a clean sweep at Berkeley, and
if there is to be one it should not be intrusted to an
Easterner. Berkeley should, have a strong and vig
orous personality in the president's chair, but there is
no reason why she should seek it at the risk of de
moralizing the staff or rendering uncertain the tenure
of cffice of the men who elect to serve her in any of
her departments.
It begins to look as if the Filipinos were awaken
ing to a realization of the fact that American bullets
are hard to dodge and don't bounce after they strike.
Up to date about a dozen candidates have come
forward to fill Tom Reed's place as Speaker of the
House, and still there is room for more.
The dispatches announce that the Coghlan incident
has been duly closed. It is possible that some covert
reference is made to the gallant captain's mouth.
ENFORCE THE LAW
NEWS OF THE MINES.
One of the few Argonauts now living
who were present at the birth of quartz
mining on Gold Mountain, near Grass Val
ley, late in 1850, is Frank Morse, who is
an engineer at the San Francisco Mint.
His interest in the nebulous history of
that beginning of quartz mining was
greatly stimulated by an account re
cently published in these columns in con
nection with the Peabody-Gold Hill suit,
involving the oldest quartz mine in the
State. The following is part of the story
told by Mr. Morse:
"I suppose there are not more . than
three or four, if as many, survivors of
that meeting of December 30, 1850, when
the Gold Mountain mining district was or
ganized. I remember the time quite well.
I went out there in .September, 1850, from
Parks Bar, on the Yuba near Marysville,
where I had been running a wheelbarrow
for $16 a day until I got a fever, as so
many of the miners did.
"This rich ledge on Gold Mountain was
known to exist for some months befote
this organization of the district, and the
recording of claims. The ledge was
broken off and turned downhill like a sort
of wave and it was not found in place
short of about forty feet below the sur
face. The side of the hill below the vein
and the ravine were rich and claims were
being worked when I got there, each
claim being 30 by 40 feet. The rules ob
served elsewhere in nearby diggings were
followed, but claims were not recorded
until December 30, 1850, when laws Were
adopted and a recorder elected. Thomas
Cracklin's claim merely happened to be
the flrst one recorded and so ranks as the
oldest one by the record. Some of the
rock of the broken vein was very rich
and, of course, the dirt was rich. The
only way most of us could work the rock
at first was by pounding up the richest
specimens on a stone with a hammer and
then panning out. A man by the name of
Huff, who 1 thnik was an old Georgia
miner, had a big mortar and it was the
only one in the diggings. He and his
party rigged up a spring pole and pOund
ed out $20,000 that winter. Long years af
ter I found Huff ranching on the Ameri
can River. To show haw much we knew
about quartz mining, a few of us pooled
our claims and run a tunnel 250 feet long
that tapped the ledge about- forty feet
below the surface. There was no water
to contend with and we could much better
have just sunk a shaft forty feet deep,
but we had an idea that we ought to have
a tunnel for some reason, probably be
cause it would be easier to get the rock
out. 1 remember that Joseph Cracklin
took out $15,000 with a mortar and went
East in 1851. I helped him pound it out.
Two men, Walsh and Wheeler, bought up
a number of the claims that winter ana
turned their sawmill into a quartz mill.
They afterward sold to a London com
pany, who sent out Melville Attwood as
manager, about 1852. -?. â¢ ....
"'Some of those lirst mills built in 1861
would be great curiosities now. One was
set up near my cabin, and would work
night and dayâ if they could get It to
work. I would be trying to sleep in
my cabin and would hear them say, 'Well,
boys, I guess we've got steam enough
now.' Then the thing would start up and
go set-choo, rattlety-bang, rattlety
bang, rattle-ty-bang, rat-tle-ty-bang, sst,
choo â bang*, and then it would stop. The
Kelly mill was not very far away,
and was made almost entirely of wood.
The wooden mortars were lined with
boiler iron. As I remember the cam shaft
it was a big lug 18 inches thick with the
wooden cams mortised in a spiral row
around it. As the journals were all of
wood, it would squeak frightfully. You
could hear it a mile sometimes. When it
would squeak a fellow would climb up
and 'dope' the bearings with molasses.
1 suppose they did not have any grease
to spare. A lot of the rock ore we
took out of our tunnel and sent to the
first mill went only $49 a ton, and as we
had to pay $50 a ton to have it crushed,
we quit."
Herbert Long, an emintent mining au
thority, has written for the New York
Engineering and Mining Journal an ex
tensive and interesting account of the
Iron Mountain mine of the Mountain Cop
per Company, in Shasta County, which is
being operated on bo large a scale.
The ore deposit, he Bays, is part of a
great lode, in some places hundreds . of
feet wide. The mine proper consists of a
great lens of ore roughly shaped; like a
ship's hull that has been . thoroughly
mapped and explored, It is estimated to
contain 1,750,000 tons of sulphides. There
is an excellent prospect of finding similar
ore bodies to the north of it. The fol
lowing is an interesting estimate of the
value of the mine:
"Assuming the correctness of Mr. Hill's
estimates of quantity and richness, the
sulphides contain very nearly 129,000 short
tons of metallic copper. The sulphides
and oxides together have over $3. 0ut), 000 in
gold, and S.tKHhiHH. ounces silver, assuming
there are 1.000.000 tons of workable limo
nlte. Th* total value at present market
prices of the three valuable metals would
be something over $53,000,000. This is
quite enough to make a good mine.
â  "After prolonged study of th*' mine and
its ores 1 concluded that it would require
ten years for the exhaustion of the known
ore body, and that by working on the
plans which I submitted to the company,
an annual net profit of $1,300,000 would be
secured, or $1.1.000.000 in all. The present
worth of this Mini might very reasonably
be taken as the value of the mine, and
this, at the ruling rates of interest, would
be about $9,000,000. This estimate, deal
ing only with the known resources, is
moderate when â â >. recognize the prob
abilities of the remainder of the great
area which is not yet fully prospected,
but in which ore is known to exist in no
small quantities.
"It can hardly be believed that this mine
laid unappreciated, though not unknown,
through so many years, while an active
search for mineral went on through this
neighborhood and all over the State. For
years, the Iron Mountain mine was
hawked about for a buyer unsuccessfully,
end was eventually sold for $300,000, part
stock, pari cash, to the present owners,
the Mathesons of London, and their asso
ciates."
The news comes this week that the Col
orado company, which is just starting one
great gold dredger on a bench of the
American River at Mississippi Bar six
miles from Folsom. 150 feet above the
river, is planning to construct tin-. or
four more in that region. Other dredging
enterprises are in process of elaboration,
and the Increase of dredgers promises '<<
be rapid. This form of the industry his
great possibilities in California, but like
anything in mining must be handled with
skill and discretion.
Mr. Postlewftite, who is California's
leading authority on the subject, says
"The field for dredging in California is
an immense one. Nearly all the rivers
draining into the Sacramento will pay to
dredge in. parts. There is virgin ground
in the beds. Then the old deposits of tail
ings are often rich, for they lost a good
deal of the poM then. Besides the
benches and old cuannels there are many
basins up in the mountains that would
pay well. Where there is a natural or ar
tificial supply of water within twelve feet
of the surface ground can he worked.
"Ground must first be thoroughly pros
pected. To sink shafts with timbering: and
pumping is costly, if not Impossible. There
is now in use a steam traction prospecting
machine, costing $2000. which will sink
and case a hole several inches in diameter
at a cost of about $3 a foot. Ten to twenty
holes should be sunk in an area of 100
acres, according to the amount of
variations. By sinking, such holes
the average values can be closely
known: there are no risks, and it be
comes a legitimate and safe enterprise,
with no element of speculation.
"Under ordinarily favorable conditions
the cost of dredging will be within three
cents a yard: Hard ground costs more,
because less is handled. Bowlders are
handled, but they lessen the output, and if
the.re are too many large ones. I would
say, 'Don't dredge.' One beauty of a
large amount of ground near Oroville is
that the bed rock is a volcanic ash,
which is easily dug up. It will all be 1
dredged some time. It is noticeable that
most of the money being invested is
Eastern money. thouph Californians are
beginning to make- many Inquiries."
Local mining laws are rapidly being
adopted, as mining districts are organized
again all over the State as a consequence
of the repeal of the State law. Last week
a convention of Tuolumne County miners
was held at th*' courthouse in Sonora "for
the purpose of adopting the old quartz
mining laws made by .-*. similar convention
held in the said dity tf Sonora.on Oc
tober 5, 1572, and also for such other reg
ulations as shall seem proper for the
protection of persons engaged In mining."
In reply to a Los Angeles (Cal.) con

In California 1000 tons of graphite equal

does not exist in California in commercial
quantities. There were several San Fran
cisco dealers, but none have produced any
of consequence for a 'ong time. The Cal
ifornia Graphite Company has a deposit
near Cazadero, Sonoma County, but it
has not produced any. The Elkhardt mine
is near Watsons, Mendocino County,
twenty-eight miles from Ukiah, but is a
non-producer, being of too low grade to
be used. There are several small known
deposits in Southern California, none of
which have been utilized.
A mining district that is attracting.con
siderable attention just now lies over in
Nevada to the east of Modoc County, oc
cording to the Redding Free Press. It is
locally known as the Pueblo district, and
is directly on the route of the old over
land immigrant trail. A number of rich
silver and copper strikes have been made
in the district and the sale of one mine,
the Denio, a copper proposition, has lately
been effected. The sale price was the
round sum of $100,000. II is stated that in
early days immigrant trains brought into
California and Oregon samples of ore
extremely rich in silverâ so rich, in fact,
that the white metal would run out in
big drops under the blowpipe. It is a for
bidding district to .he prospector, how
ever, owing to the scarcity of water and
lack of transportation facilities.
Shasta County's lead in copper mining
is being followed by a general waking up
as to copper possibilities in other mining
counties, says the Redding Free Press.
Reports from Siskiyou County Indicate
that the people have faith that a copper
smelter there is only a question of a year
or so. as large bodies of copper-bearing
ore are encountered in several districts
of the county. A 40-ton smelter to handle
the ores of the Copper Queen mine is an
assured addition to the wealth-producing
agencies of Trinity County. A copper
smelter Is being erected in Plumas Coun
ty. Several deposits in that county are
under bond and are now being examined
by experts.
"My correspondence." says Fred Grote
fend in the Redding Searchlight, "has re
vealed many inquiries with regard to the
deep ground possibilities of the Coffee
Creek section, and I had an idea that
there would be quite a number of pros
pectors there this summer, but I did not
think they would come as early as April.
1 am reliably informed, however, that for
the past ten days or two weeks fully fif
teen men have gone in there each day,
most of them possessed of a fund of ex
perience and equipped to stay all sum
mer. There is no getting around the
fact that the men who do scientific min
ing are impressed with the possibilities in
existence there. It is the scientific men
who are sending those prospectors there."

pastor of Trinity Church, is preparing for
an early departure, and will leave shortly

blnce the reverend gentleman and the
â vestry agreed to disagree there has been
much gossiping as to the whys and
â¢wherefores that caused the vestry to act
po summarily. It [ a known thai dissatis
faction with the pastor dated back many
months and that Dr. Cooke was not
ignorant of the dissension his presence in
the church caused among the parishion
ers. At that early flay Dr. Cooke earn
estly desired an Investigation and offered
to withdraw if thai appeared to the
vestry to be the wisest plan. In the tem
pest in the Trinity teapot Dr. Cooke found
some warm adherents, but many dissatis
fied ones who resented the Innovations he
was pleased to make and In general found
fault with the pastor, his methods and
his personal tastes. It is alleged that
even his love for the dainty and the
beautiful fell under their displeasure, and
they grumblingly complained when the
man who should have been their spiritual
advisor tied a fragrant hunch of blos
soms to the handle-bar of his bicycle.
Dr. Cooke is the son of Jaj Cooke, the
noted financier, and consequently well
provided with this world's Roods; yet
when the reverend gentleman expressed
himself as not In the church for salary
those who made that salary possible
looked upon this statement as a personal
affront and registered another 'kick"
against their pastor.
However, the vestry has chosen to over
look Dr. Cooke's monetary principles and
have paid over to the gentleman $750â $2.">0
salary for the month, allowed as a vaca
tion, and $.100 as a godspeed.
No action has as yet been taken to ap
point a successor to Dr. Cooke. It is a
matter In which the vestry has decided
to act with extreme care. Rev. Mr. Han
son will till the pulpit until a man is
chosen, and it has been decided that there
is no cause for hurry in the matter.
A debt of $2000 hung over the church
when Dr. Cooke was call( and during
his administration the debt has grown
to J7OOO. These figures, however, are not
causing the vestry any anxiety, and they
claim there will be no trouble in canceling
the entire debt. One cause for genuine re
joicing is the return of C. V. S. Gibbs to
the church. Mr. Gibbs was one of Dr.
Cooke's most bitter enemiesâ an enmity
not founded upon any personal dislike but
based entirely upon Mr. Glbbs' inability
to hear and understand the pastor.
Gibbs, who. by the way. is the only one
left of the original founders of he church.

petition in the United States District

alleged that the respondents had com

themselves to be attached by the Dono
hoe-Kelly Banking Company and that the
bank and the respondents had engaged in
a conspiracy to have the bank enjoy a
preference over th*- rest of the creditors.
Judge de Haven decided that the allega
tions in tie- complaint were true with the
exception of that which charged conspir
acy on the part of th*- bank against the
other creditors; but tie- court found that
the action was commenced and the at
tachment levied upon the property of the

judgment out of the property attached,

ing order was therefore dissolved and
Trustee William D. Scurlock was given
full power to close up the affairs of the
estate.
j The case has been all the more interest
! ing because of the fact that the alleged
act of Insolvency was committed just
before the Federal bankruptcy law went
into effect. Tin remaining creditors tiled
the petition in the United States District
Court among the first, and at one time
there threatened to be a contest on the
matter of Jurisdiction; but the United
States District Court took hold of the
affair and restrained Sheriff Whelan from
interfering with tin- trustee in disposing
of the property of the insolvent firm.
With this decision the suit has been
: practically wound up.
HELD A NIGHT SESSION.
Judge Groezinger Listens to testi
mony in the Wong Tang Per
jury Case. "
Judge Groezinger held a night session
last evening with a view to disposing of
the case of Wong Tang, charged with
perjury, but was unable to finish the case
owing to the lengthy examination of wit
nesses and the number subpenaed.
' Wong Tang was arrested at the Instiga
tion of Ong Foon. a member of the Chi
nese Educational Society, who was ac
quitted of murder by a jury In Santa
Rosa a month ago. <ni*i Foon, the com
plaining witness in the Police Court pro
,.. dings, claims that Wong Tang commit
ted perjury on the trial of himself for al
leged extortion a few months ago. The
case has been hanging lire owing to the
absence of ting Foon in Santa Rosa. On
his return to this city he took the matter
up. as Wong Tang had testified against
him at the murder trial.
Wong Tang was placed on the stand last
night and examined at length by his at
torney, Arthur E. Mack. The other wit
nesses called were George Downey and
Gut Finn, two Chinatown watchmen. The
case will go on again to-morrow at noon.
Fired at the Seals.

REORGANIZATION SALE IS ON.
The Immense Establishment of J. J. :
O'Brien & Co. Is Thronged With
Intending Purchasers.
The reorganization sale of J. J. O'Rrien
<Sr Co. commenced yesterday and proved
a success beyond all expectations. The
mammoth store was thronged through
out the day and all departments were lib
j erally patronized.
The ladles in particular seemed to ap
preciate the value of th.- bargains offered
them, and many were heard expressing
their Intention to return and patronize
the establishment more extensively. The
sales were so large In volume that many
packages could not be delivered last
night, the capacity of the many delivery
wagons not being equal to the occasion.
The Immense stock of the establish
ment has been shown to the best advan
tage, so that Intending purchasers In
quest of bargains have no difficulty in
finding articles to suit their fancy, no
matter in what direction may run their
tastes.

OLYMPIC CLUB IS TO

DIRECTORS DECIDE THE VEXED
QUESTION.

Club Is Divided, Some Eager for the
New Accommodation, Others
Oppose It.

After several months of deliberation the '
directors of the Olympic Club have at
last decided to add a bar and grillroom to !
the club's accommodations. This propo
sition has been under consideration for
some time, as the pinion of the club was
divided m regard to the introduction of
a bar.
There are still two well-defined parties
In th.- club, sunn- who advocate the Intro
auction of the bar and others who violent
ly oppose ii. One side claims that alco
hol should not be used Internally in an
athletic club because it is likely to prove
a peril among the younger members. They
fear that the bar privileges will be
abused and that the morale of the club
will be destroyed.
As yet arrangements for th.- new bar
flnd grill have not been perfected. It is
very likely that the privilege will be given

DRIED FRTIT IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial says: "Prunes re- I
main steady at about previous range of quota- ,
tions. with trade conflned to comparatively i
small orders from interior distributors. There
have been some offerings of renovated stock. I
which has Injured the sale of the better grades
somewhat; but it is understood that th" light
stocks held by dealers will exert little inlluence
ultimately. It is not the season for heavy de- |
n.and. and trade is limited to small quantities.
Prices are generally firm, though It was said
yesterday that some lots were sold at a slight
reduction from published figures.
â¢â¢Raisins are virtually unchanged. There I
have been sales recently of some hundreds of j
cases to seeders slightly below the market j
price for ungraded goods, but It was said yes- )
terday that no more were obtainable at the re- i
duced figure. Graded stocks are quiet at about j
previously reported prices. Demand is com- |
parattvely light for all grade?, and the situa- i
tion shows no indication of immediate Improve- j
ment.
"Peaches -ire in the same position as at last
reports. In general, conditions do not change, j
Demand Is restricted hy high prices and
movement is limited to the few small lots in- i
terior distributors take. Prices range at 23
@28c for peeled, with occasional sales up to 30c, |
nnd the tendency is still upward.
"Apricots are in very slight supply, and j
dealings are small. Holders nre not urging
sales, and hich prices nit purchases to actual ;
requirements of consumption." ;
THE LUMBER TRADE.
Paclflc Coast Wood and Iron says of lumber: :
â¢'The lumber trade circles of the Pacific coast
were never in a more prosperous condition than
at the present writing. California. Oregon and
Washington are a unit In the good ding \
â¢which prevails, while Arizona mills
are rushed with orders. Prices have
advanced and stand firm ' at pree
ent quotations, with a strong tendency to ad
vance. This Is In the wholesale markets, while â¢
the retail circles also feel the renewed stimu
lus and prices In their lines have likewise taken
a Jump to the good.
"The mills are running full time and are
crowded with orders, which will necessitate an
unusual activity for some time to come Shin
gle mills are being erected all over California \
and additions to the old mill plants are gen- |
erally being made so that the Ingle output i
can bf Increased. Prices stand it $1 37. but
there seems to be every prospect of an advance
for both plain and fancy grades.
"Building operations in both urban and sub
urban districts have renewed the healthy de- |
manda icr hardwood lumber, and the market I
is healthy along all lines. The quasl-associa- j
Hon still holds its prices In hardwood for cer- |
tain purposes an*l an excellent season is upon i
ar.d before the iocal hardwood Interests.
"Foreign shipments of lumber are numerous
nnd all of the cargoes are large and hold at
good rates. England has renewed her previous
demands, while the Orient. Australia and South
America, together with the Hawaiian Islands, I
fire sending in a steady stream of orders. The I
latter port of receipt has about all the lumber j
lt can utilize for some few mont I to come. I
Advices from the Orient and Vladivostok point ]
toward a good market for Pacific coast woods, I
ami the prices are responsive.
"In the Eastern States the spring trade is :
commencing and the general commercial activ
ity promisee a good year for the lumber trade, j
"The receipts of lumber at San Francisco
were larger in April than in the previous
month, save those from Mendocino County. The
latter show a decrease of 703,033 feet, while i
pine, spruce and fir advanced the figures by j
some 534,000 feet, and both Humboldt and Del '
Norte counties total more than in March.
Taken all In all. the lumber prospects are very
promising and. with advancing prices and en
larging Eastern and foreign calls. a brilliant !
year should be recorded In the history of the
lumber trade of the Ra. ;r)e slope and the West !
ln general."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW Y.ORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May -Stock prices ranged
over a wide radius to-day, and ended
wlth good gains for the day. A considerable j
advance, ranging from 1 to 3 points, in the !
specialties occurred in the first half hour, aided
by purchases of round amounts of the interna
tional stocks for London account. Stock values
then suffered on a continuance of yesterday's
heavy liquidation, and receded sharply, the
specialties losing from 2to nearly 6 points. By
noon liquidation had practically ceased, and
there were rallies, which, among the special- '
ties, ranged from 8* to $%. The standard rail
roads moved less widely except for Burlington
and Delaware and Hudson, which made net ,
gains of l* and 3%, respectively. Among the I
specialties, the net gains extend to 14% In Air :
Brake, 6* in Metropolitan. 3% in Manhattan,
3% ln Brooklyn Transit and an average of 2
points in Federal Steel.. Sugar, National Steel
and Tennessee Coal and Iron. Coll money j
rates ruled at 5 per cent most of the day. and ! !
their steadiness was a source of confidence as
was the easier tone In sterling exchange, which j
was attributed to the London purchase â¢of. '
stocks. Another reason which might be as- M
signed for the rally was the fact that the Ford
franchise tax bill would not figure ln the tax ;
levy of this year, and that the hope of those I
interested in the securities affected was that
the delay of a year might bring about a ;
modification of its provisions. The sharp
speculative contest between the bulls and bears
In Brooklyn Transit, which ultimately resulted
In favor of the former, was. because of it.- I
great activity, a sentimental influence In favor ! '
of taking the long side in other properties. The
dissemination ot a story that the susar in
siders were indisposed to come to terms with
present rivals because of the fear that other
syndicates stood ready to start up a new
opposition, was supposed to have something to
do with the dip in sugar, but the readiness of
a large house to absorb offerings brought about
a rally, in which the earlier loss was more than
recovered.
Besides the tax franchise bill, the rate war
induced liquidation in Consolidated Gas, but
covering of shorts and other purchases caused
the stocks to rise above last night's figures.
The rapid fluctuations with alternate pro
nounced weakness and strength caused a re
duction In the outside interest and left the mar
ket much of the day in the hands of the pro
fessionals. Late in the afternoon, when the
market broadened out and a general move
ment was under way, activity of commission
houses was again noted.
The market left Off strong at generally the
best prices. Some recessions occurred in tho
bond market in sympathy with th.- early
llquldatlon in stocks, but there were later
partial recoveries. The total rales, $2,525,001
United States 2s coupons and the new 4s
coupons declined % in the hid price.

CALIFORNIA PRUNES IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, May 2.â The Journal of Com
merce says: Reports of the heavy drop of'
prunes usually expected at this time are be- :
ginning to come in. Letters received from all I
the growing districts are of the same purport.
The trade here is generally disposed to accept
these reports with a good deal of allowance,
for the natural desire of growers to start the
season with promulgation of such features as
will be mi st advantageous to them, but there
are a number of prominent handlers here who,
while admitting that conditions now governing .
growing crops may not be so bad as has been
. published through the letters of Interested
growers, are of opinion that there Is go.
ground for believing the crop will turn out to
be be considerably less than last year. One
of these merchants to-day said he had little
doubt that the reported damage to the crop
was not overestimated by his California cor
respondents. He could not agree with some
of them that the present drop was due to the j
recent warm weather, but was disposed to at- j
tribute it to a loss of vitality in trees caused i
by the prolonged drought last winter, which
killed many trees and undoubtedly had a
weakening effect upon tne rest.
A feature contributing to the strong feeling
among handlers Of prunes here is the prospect
of a large demand from Eu ope this year, __
the result of reported short prune crops there.

MAJOR BEN C. TRUMAN IS AP
POINTED A COMMISSIONER.
â¦
When the Governor Reaches Sacra
mento He Will be Ready to
Name the Board of
Health.
Governor Gape arrive., from Los An
gr-tcs on the Owl yesterday morning and
went to the Palace Hotel. He will remain
In San Francisco until to-morrow even
ing and then go to Sacra- He was
engaged yesterday with ex-Senator
Stephen M. White, Judge Ross and others
in considering business matters relating
to mining affairs.
Many of the place-seekers were anxious
to see the Governor and ascertain if ap
pointments were soon to be announced.
The aspirants for the oilice of Labor Com
missioner are the most active, but the In
terest manifested In the impending
changes in the Hoard of Health is very
great. The Governor Is not paying much
attention to the contest lor presidency of
tho State University. He said last night
that he did not suppose that he would at
tend the meeting of the committee ot Re
gents to-day. He doubted whether lie
would attend the meeting of the board
next week or ever preside at any or the
sessions.
The Governor said without hesitation
and with a knowledge that the statement
would be published that he had radi
cally appointed Major Ben C. Truman as
one* of the Commissioners of California
to the Paris Exposition: He also re
marked that he had tendered a similar
appointment to M. H. de Young, but that
the latter declined to accept the position.
He was asked if Mark L. McDonald was
to be one of the Commissioners, but the
inquiry did not elicit an affirmative or
negative respense.
The accomplishments of Major Truman
were dwelt upon with delight. The major
reported the iirst speech that Governor
Cage made in California. The event oc
curred some twenty years ago at Wil
mington, and according to the Governor's
account of the affair the major not only
fully but accurately reported the speech.
Aside from this the major has had other
Training to tU him for the position of
Commissioner to represent California at
Paris. He was once secretary of the Yo
semite Commission and chief writer of the
Southern Pacific Literary Bureau. Later
he was prominently identified with the
horticultural department of tie World's
Fair at Chicago, and last but not least
wrote a book on dueling. While he was
busily engaged in preparing the horticul
tural exhibit of the Chicago fair hi was
challenged to fight a duel by a sub-com
missioner or attache of the exposition.
Th.c difficulty was adjusted without the
loss of blood. The Governor's judgment
that the major is a good man for the
place is seconded by many others, some
of whom fancy also that the place is a
good one for the major. Colonel Henry
Kowalsky is a candidate for the office of
Commissioner. He would be. delighted to
accept the place which Mr. de Young
declined.
The Governor may devote same time to
day to the. consideration of appointments
for the Board of Health. Labor Commis
sioner, the Code Commission, Commis
sioner of the Bureau of Highways and
Registrar of Voters for San Francisco.
He Indicated last night that he would not
announce his selections until he reached
Sacramento. It is almost a certainty that
some of the many oilice seekers will be
relieved of anxiety before next Saturday
night.
Governor Gage was so busy yesterday
that he did not get time to go down to
the steamship office at the foot of Market
street and pay his respects to Hon. George
C. Perkins, the United States Senator
from California.

Kagan was in this city about a month

Honolulu to visit his son, who has large
coffee plantations on the islands. Genera]
Eagan's wife is now at Honolulu, and

POSTUM CEREAL.
LED INTO IT
By Following, the Habit of Friends.
As I took my coffee in very moderate
Quantities, 1 really did not believe what
my friends frequently told me, that
coffee was the cause of the gas on my
Ftomach, which has troubled me for,
oh, perhaps forty years.
I am now a little over sixty. years
old, and I know that this gas trouble
came on about the time I was twenty,
and has been with me ever since. I
have denied myself almost every kind
of food pleasant to my taste, but with-
out any appreciable benefit. N
All of my friends have known of 'my
trouble, M it has been of such long
duration. me time ago I was called
to. nurse a sick friend who had Postum
Food Coffee In the pantry and used it
In place of coffee, praising it very
highly. For about a week I used it as
they did, as my only beverage, and the
second day I noticed a change in my
condition, and from that time on I
never had one attack of the belching
of gas. The friends, exclaimed, "Why,
where has your .trouble gone?" and
every one in the house knew that I had
been entirely cured by leaving off cof-
fee and taking Poetum Cereal instead.
You can depend upon it that never
since that time has coffee passed my
lips, and never will while I can get the
food drink, Postum. My stomach has
grown so strong since that time that I
can eat anything I like and now take
great pleasure in my meals and in life
altogether. I send you a list of friends
whom I know have been greatly helped
by leaving off the use of ordinary cof-
fee and using Postum Food Coffee in
its place. Some of these made very
flat, poor Postum, on the start as they
only boiled it a few minutes, but it la
generally known now about here that
the only way to get the flavor is to boil
it long enough. L. M. Graham, 729

THE LEELANAW IN HER NEW DRESS.
WHEN the transport Leelanaw was carrying gold-hunters to the Klondike she wore a black dress, but
now that she is under charter to carry mutes and munitions of war to Manila for the Government, '
her owners have painted her white. She was moved from Main street to the Government wharf a
few days since and it is expected she will leave for the Philippines to-day.

Captain C. B. Johnson Appointed by
the Pilot Commissioners to Suc
ceed Pilot yon Schmidt,
Deceased.
The funeral of Colonel TT. G. Egbert,
who was killed In battle, took place from
the transport Sherman yesterday. Troop
M of the Fourth Cavalry and the mount
ed band came In from the Presidio to
serve as an escort to the remains of the
dead soldier, while Major and Judge Ad
vocate Groesbeck. and Major Fie and
Captains Plummer and Noble, aids-de
camp to General Shafter were the pall
bearers. The coffin was mounted upon a
gun carriage, both being draped with the
stars and stripes and the colors of the
regiment. From Folsom-street wharf the
cortege moved to the overland ferry,
where the 4 p. m. boat was met. The re
mains will be taken to Arlington Ceme
tery, Washington, D. C, where the inter
ment will take place.
The freight transport Leelanaw sails for
Manila to-day. When she is on the road
there will be a lull, as it will probably be
three weeks before another vessel gets
away. The Grant is in quarantine and
will not be .released until Monday next.
The Sherman goes on Hunters Point dry
dock to-day, and when she comes off it
will take sixteen days to overhaul her
machinery. The Centennial arrived yes
terday, thirty-five days from Manila and
twenty-three days from Nagasaki, but as
a case of smallpox developed during the
voyage she had to Join the Grant at An
gel Island.
The return of the Centennial to Manila
is doubtful. She Is used as a cargo boat,
and as the Snerman and Grant will carry
6000 tons of freight and 3500 soldiers there
will be nothing left for her to do for a
time, at any rate.
The Grant and Sherman will require -a
considerable amount of overhauling be
fore they can go to sea again. They went
from New York to the Philippines via the
Red Sea, and after doing considerable
transport duty among the islands came on
to San Francisco. In consequence a lot
of temporary repairs had to be made at
sea, and these will now be overhauled
and made permanent.
The Leelanaw takes away to-day a lot
of muli . and horses for the army trans
port corps and the guns and ammunition
of the Light Battery that left here on the
Newport last month. A supply of feed
for the animals and a small quantity of
army rations are also aboard. Every pre
caution has been taken for the safety of
the animals. The ship is Illuminated
throughout with electri* and a con
densing engine will supply all the water
required. At Honolulu the mules will be
landed and given a rest, after which the
voyage to Manila will continue. The ship
Tacoma, now out ten days from the isl
ands, will probably get here the latter
pari of the month. She is fitted out to
carry animals ami will probably go back
to Manila with a load of mules as soon
as she can be got ready.
The Valencia left Nagasaki on April 26
and the Portland Is seventeen days out,
bo both these transports should he"in and
ready to sail again (if Uncle Sam wants
them) by tho time tho Sherman and
Grant are ready for sea.
The transport Charles Nelson arrived at
Manila in time for the soldiers to take
part in the Dewey day celebration. The
chances are that she will be coppered at
Cavite and. used as an Inter-Island trans
port. '"7 f--;' 'â â â 'â â  â¢"â  "â¢-'*'
The Pilot Commissioners yesterday ap
pointed Captain C. B. Johnson a, pilot to
succeed Captain yon Schmidt, deceased.
Johnson is a brother of the pilot who
wrecked the Mail Company's steamer
New York, .and has not been to sea for
ten years. He came out here as master
of a sailing vessel and then went Into the
employ of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company. He was with that concern for
a very long time and brought the Santa
Rosa out here from the East. When the
southern boom broke out Johnson relin
quished the command of the Santa Rosa
and went to San Luis Obispo, where ho
superintended the building of the Hotel
Ramona. He ran that concern a while
and then came back to San Francisco,
where ho engaged in the boiler-covering
business. ,

A POLICEMAN
USES HIS CLUB
ON A BOATMAN
Wounded on the Face,

ATTACKS WERE UNPROVOKED
CHARGES PREFERRED BEFORE
THE POLICE COMMISSIONERS.
Officer Frank Greenan Gets Back at
the Boatman by Having Him
Arrested for Bat
tery.
When the Police Commissioners meet
to-night they will hear charges preferred
by John Barry, a boatman on the water
front, against Policeman Frank Greenan
for unofflcerllke conduct In brutally strik
ing him on the head and face with his
club without the slightest provocation,
which is a too common practice with
some officers.
According to Barry's statement, he was
in a saloon on Folsom street a week ago
yesterday afternoon drinking a glass of
beer when Greenan came in, and, draw
ing his club, made a rush at him, club
bing him on the head. Barry ran out of
the bar into a room in the rear and took
refuge under a bed. Greenan pursued
him, and, dragging him from under the
bed, kicked and clubbed him again.
Barry got out of the place as quickly
as possible and went to a saloon at Fre
mont and Folsom streets. Greenan had
apparently followed him, as he had only
been there a few minutes when the offi
cer made his appearance. Greenan again
clubbed Barry bo bad that he had to be
taken to the Harbor. Hospital, where live
stitches were put in a lacerated wound
in his scalp, two in a wound in his temple
and six in a wound on his lip.
During the attack in the two saloons
Barry asked Greenan to arrest him If he
had any charge to prefer against him,
but this the officer declined to do, which
apparently is the most surprising feature
of the whole business.
* Barry made formal charges against
Greenan before the Commissioners after
making a complaint to Captain Spillane,
and the charges will be heard to-night.
As soon as Greenan was served with a
copy of the charges he swore to a com
plaint in Judge Mogan's court charging
Barry with battery. Barry was arrested
Monday night and the case was called In
* curt yesterday morning. By consent it
was continued till to-day, when the whole
facts will come out.
Greenan has been four times before the
Commissioners recently on different
charges, and if Barry's charges aro
proved against him the probability is
that he will be dismissed from the force.
PERSISTENT SMUGGLERS.
Steerage Steward of the Curacao De
tected With Contraband Mexi
can Cigars.
The steamer Curacao is keeping up its
reputation as a smuggler of Mexican ci
gars, or rather as an attempted smuggler,
for almost every time she arrives from
Mexico the customs Inspectors find on
board from 600 to several thousand cigars
secreted about the vessel for the purpose
of being smuggled ashore. On most of
these occasions the contraband goods
have been found stowed away in the
crew's quarters, but yesterday morning
the steerage steward, whose name was
not given, was detected in the act. He
left tho steamer at the Broadway dock
with a valise in his. hand, but was
watched by Customs Inspector Stephens,'
who asked him what was in the valise.
The steward made no reply, but dropped
the valise as though it were so much
dynamite and scampered away as fast
as ills legs would carry him. He had not
been seen again up to the time The Call
went to press this morning. The valise
was found to contain 800 Mexican cigars.
They were confiscated.

UNCERTAINTY
RULES AMONG
THE DEMOCRACY
Anxious About Cen
tral Committee.
HEENEY PROTEST A MENACE
WILL BE FELT IN THE COMING
EIGHT.
Chris Buckley Said to be in the
Saddle Ready to Do Queer
Things With the Pri
mary Law.
All good Democratic eyes are turned to
ward the meeting of the executive com
mittee of the State Central Committee
which will be held in the California Ho
tel to-morrow night. On the face of it
there is nothing of Importance to come
before the meetingâ only the appeal of
Heeney from the action of the committee
of one hundred In making itself the mu
nicipal convention of San Francisco; but
an attempt will be made to have this ap
peal the basis of the downfall of the Phe
lan body and its final exit from local
politics. The Heeney appeal has been be
fore the executive committee since the
last campaign and has dragged an uncer
tain existence through several sessions,
but the political pot is simmering for the
coming fight for city government and the
old case will be made to do duty in earn
est.
The Democratic campaign has hardly
opened. There are no definite combina
tions made and no factions In the field,
but quiet work is going on all the time,
and it is a safe prediction that before
May is well on Its way across the calen
dar there will be plenty doing in the
Democratic haunts.
Already talk of district clubs is being
beard and several of the districts are
fitted out ln this respect even this early
in the campaign. Buckley, too, is re
ported to have established headquarters
and made himself ready for something to
turn up, and the committee of one hun
dred is emerging from Its hibernation and
ls thinking of primaries under the new
law and a basketful of other things which
so far can only be guessed at.
The primaries are the main object of
the purists, however, and through them
much Is hoped to be gained. The present
plan is to put through a blanket ticket
and corral everything in sight, though
that means if the new law and the old
friends will only stand for it.
Under the new law everybody votes at
every one else's primary; delegates are
named from the districts, the precincts
or at large, just as the appointing power
sees fit, ami the committee of one hun
dred has come to the conclusion that at
large is good enough for tnem. The Idea
is to have the names of all the delegates
to the municipal convention printed upon
a slip and made ready for the willing
voter, and then to have nil the commit
tees" friends vote the slip by passing it
on the primary ticket in strict accord
ance with the law, but hardly with Dem
ocratic principles.
The delegates will not be selected to
represent any particular district; they
will be taken from anywhere there Is a
man who is willing to do the right thing
from a committee standpoint. District
lines and precinct lines will play no part
in the selection, and the proceedings of
the last election, where the banner Dem
ocratic district- received two delegates
and the banner Republican district re
ceived seventeen delegates to the Demo
cratic convention, will be repeated
The new primary law will cut the most
prominent figure in the coming campaign,
for it Is something untried and not viewed
without suspicion. The election at Stock
ton only recently called attention to the
first loophole, and there is no telling how
many more will appear before the local
politicians have had their swing at it
in Stockton it was found that one side
had no contest. Its delegates were per
fectly safe, and so the surplus vote was
used to dabble in the politics of the other
side, to the great gratification of the
bosses and the chagrin of the party med
dled with.
In pursuance of the new law, the Elec
tion Commission has issued certain orders
to govern tho coming primary and among
them is the following:
Each political party, as aforesaid, shall file
with the Hoard of Election Commissioners, on
or before July 8, 1.99, its petition authenti
cated by its chairman and secretary, setting
forth: The name of the party; that the peti
tion is authenticated by the proper officer
of the party committee; that It Is the Inten
tion of such party to hold a local convention
for the purpose of making nominations of can
didates for city and county offices to be voted
for on Tuesday, November 7, 1599, In ac
cordance with Section 1, Chapter 2, Article XI
of the "New Charter," and request a place
upon the official primary election ballot. The
petition must specify in detail the apportion
ment of delegates, whether at large, or by
Assembly districts, or by primary election pre
cincts, or by combinations thereof for the pro
posed convention. The petition must be veri
fied by the proper officers of the party, before
an officer authorized to administer oaths.
The clause allowing the apportionment
p{ delegates at large Is where Â£32 blanket
ticket finds its authority, and under that
it Is expected that the entire ticket of the
committee of one hundred will be sub
mitted to each Democratic voter regard
less of his district or his precinct, and
that in that wav the committee will lose
none of its strength by reason of having
to make fights in places where lt ls not
strong. Committee of one hundred clubs
are being formed In many districts, and
it is hoped to secure a strong organiza
tion, but there are others in the field and
lt will not be surprising if the anti-com
mittee forces should show their teeth.
T__ere>are Buckley clubs in some of the
districts and there are Central Commit
tee clubs, and there are more of all kinds
being formed; but the committee of one
hundred ls far ahead with its schemes
and its organization, and unless It gets a
setback from the action of the executive
committee of the State Central Commit
tee lt will play another big part In the
charter campaign of the Democrats.
FILIPINOS AT THE FAIR..
Arrangements Made for Many Novel
Exhibitions.
Much routine business was transacted
at the meeting of the board of trustees
of the Mechanics' Institute last night.
The privilege of publishing the daily pa
per at the Mechanics' Pavilion during the
Fair was awarded to Julius Biumenthal
for $SlO, and it was also decided to con
tinue the publishing of the Library Bul
letin and the contract for the same was
let to Upton Brothers, they being the low
est of several bidders. The board donated
300 volumes to be sent to the soldiers at
Manila, 100 to the Lick Old Ladies' Home
and 100 to the college settlement at South
Park.
A letter was read from Assistant Secre
tary of War Meiklejohn stating that the
quartermaster general .had sanctioned
the request made for the transportation
of 100 tons of freights and 100 natives from
the Philippines for exhibition at the fair.
The freight and natives will be brought
over on one of the transports, the latter
at the expense of the Mechanics' Insti-
I tute. Secretary Cummings read a number
| of letters relative to the exhibits to be
I made at the fair, which showed that there
I will be excellent ones, both from the Phil
| ippines and Honolulu. Everything ls pro
gressing nicely and the outlook for the
exhibition Is exceedingly bright.

Sure Rupture Cure.
Wonderful Restoration Re-
ported From Boston,
Mass.
_
GEO. F. MULFORD CURED AFTER
SUFFERING EIGHTEEN
YEARS.
Despite the claims so frequently made that a
surgical operation is necessary to cure rupture,
the case of Geo. F. Mulford of Boston, Mass.,
who resides at 484 Bast 7th street, is pointed
out as a direct refutation of the surgery be-
lief. Mr. Mulford was ruptured for eighteen
years and tried everything known almost, but
failed to even derive benefit. His rupture waa
such that trusses did not hold him and for this
reason the surgery Idea was presented to him
as the last resort. A final effort was made by
the comparatively new method invented by Dr.
W. B. Rice of Adams, N. V., well known an a
rupture cure specialist, and in two weeks after
treatment began Mr. Mulford was practically
a cured man without having suffered pain.
operation, detention from work or suffering of
any kind.
GEO. F. MULFORD.
The Important feature of the Rice Invention
Is the fact that It hold! any kind of a rupture
no matter how severe it may he and is worn
with so much ease and comfort night and day
that a person scarcely realizes he Is wearing It.
The case of Mr. Mulford is somewhat Identic
cal With that of Geo. Hell of St. Charles>
Minn., reported cured by the same method of
treatment. It Is a wonderfully brilliant In-
vention, is sold at a marvelously low price,
and is the greatest blessing ever devised for
those who have suffered with rupture and
erroneously believe there is. no cure outside of
the knife.
Readers should send for Dr. Rice's illus-
trated book on the cure of rupture and mall it
to any one they know to be ruptured. Such an
act of kindness will he worth a great deal to
those who suffer with this great affliction.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
WAR AGAINST
ROADIE DENS
TO BE WAGED
Supervisors Take a
Decided Stand.
THE "THALIA" IS CITED
PLENTY OF EVIDENCE IS TO BE
PRODUCED.
Residents in a Rapidly Settling Dis- â 
trict Object to the Granting of
Licenses for Saloons to
Improper Persona,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 2.
Next Monday morning M. Casley, in
whose name is granted the license for the
Thalia roadside house on the San Leandro
road, must appear before the Super
and show cause why his license should
not be revoked. This action was deter
mined upon by the beard this morning.
The question of the disorderly houses
along the San Leandro road has become
one of paramount Importance during the
past three years, during which time the
territory has rapidly become settled, ow
ing to the electric road. Before this time
the county road was dotted with roadside
houses, but as there were no residents
near them their character was not ex- ,
ploited. Now it is different, and the hun
dreds of respectable residents in the many
settlements along the San Leandro road
have determined on a change and have
so informed the Supervisors.
This morning Attorney Kinsell renewed
his application to have the license of the j
Thalia revoked. He declared that apart
from the character of the house the li
cense had not been properly granted, and
he also stated that this objection applied ;
to several other roadside houses. The
ordinance requires that the applicant ;
must be shown to be a man of good moral
character and a fit person to conduct the
saloon decently. This is. not shown in the
case of Casley.
Supervisor Church said that Attorney
Kinsell Is not the only person who has
complained about the Thalia. A number
of residents in that neighborhood have
told him that the place was run in a dis
reputable manner.
Supervisor Mitchell said that since the
complaint mad*, at the last meeting he
had made some inquiry as to the charac
ter of the Thalia loon and had ascer
tained that it was not what it should be.
At the last meeting it was stated that
there had been an orgie at the place and
a man severely injured. Although the
complaint had not been made after the
style of a regular protest, still Mr. Mit
chell thought the board had a right to
compel the owner of the place to appear
and explain all about the light of last
Sunday week.
An argument followed between Chair
man Talcott, Mr. Church and Mr. Mitchell
as to the jurisdiction of the board regard
ing the revocation of a license when it
knew that the law was being violated,
' even when no formal complaint was
made. District Attorney Allen said that
the board could revoke any license at any
time it saw fit when It was satisfied the
law was being broken. Mitchell wanted
to know what evidence there was in this
case to warrant such a revocation, to
which Mr. Church replied that there
â would be plenty of evidence forthcoming
at the proper time.

CONTRACT FOR
DREDGING LAKE
MERRITT VOID
Big Improvements to
Cease.
A CARELESS AGREEMENT
I
MONEY MAY BE USED FOR
OTHER PURPOSES.
Contractors Have Done a Lot of Good
Work for Which They May .
Not Receive Any
Pay.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 2.
The contract awarded by the late Board
of Public Works is null and void and the
large Improvements recently commenced
are necessarily stopped. Judge Ellsworth
gave a decision this morning in the action
brought by F. W. Ruppert against Con
tra* O. P. Johnson, and declared that
1 for many reasons the contract Is mi
i valid.
In discussing the case. Judge Ellsworth
said â¢hat there are many intricate points
of law Involved in the suit, but a few of
them are all that is necessary to decide
â  it. "The city charter says," said the
! court, "that the contract must specify at
what time the work is to commence and
be finished. In this contract there are
' two provisions as to time; one states that
'. the work must be finished by June 30;
the other that the work must be com
pleted within one year from the letting
of the contracts. The Board of Public
- Works seems to have reserved to Itself
the matter of determining at what date
the work la to be finished. This is in con
travention of the charter. The contract
st.it. that the work must be finished by
June 30, if the amount of cubic yards
dredged from the lake does not exceed
55,000. There is no provision made if the
; number of cubic -yards exceed this
j amount. In my judgment the contract
â¢ fixes neither time nor amount, nor does
it say that the work has to be done ac
cording to specifications.
"In the contract there were more speci
fications than there were In the adver
tised proposals. I see no escape from
these conditions, In the proposals there
is no provision for a gate at the Twelfth
street dam. In the contract this provi
sion for a gate is a very important item.
1 will not pass upon any other questions,
for these convince me that the contract
is void, and it is so ordered."
Much disappointment is expressed by
those who secured the commencement of
the improvements around Lake Merritt.
Johnson's attorney and City Attorney
Dow have not yet decided whether to ap
peal the case or not.
The dredging ceased a week ago, as
there was a doubt regarding the pay- :
ment for work done. Tne contractor has
built an expensive dredger in the lake,
has constructed over a thousand feet of
bulkhead of heavy timbers and has
dredged some thousands of cubic yards
!of mud from the lake. He has received
| one payment of J2OOO and has earned
' about $10,000, in addition to the expense
! of probably $15,000 for building, the
dredger.
City Attorney Dow says that the money
appropriated for tne work will remain in
tact, as another contract will be let. It
â  does not follow, however, that the same
j contractor will get the work. But as the
! dredger and retaining wans are necessary
i for the completion of the work. Contrac
, tor Peterson will probably be paid some-
I how.
City Treasurer Gilpin declares that the
' annulment of the contract will place
these $55,000 at the dlsposa. of the other
â â  funds after June 30. Under the law all
'â  moneys not earned in the several funds
â  by the end of the fiscal year can be
â  transferred by the Council to any other
j fund. t-^y
MASTERS MAY BE PARDONED.
Monster Petition Presented to the
Faculty in His Behalf.
BERKELEY, May Over 1000 stu
dents of the University of California have
asked the members of the faculty to re
scind their recent action in dismissing
from college the editor of this year's
Blue and Gold. Their petition, couched in
simple, respectful language, voices the
unanimous opinion of the entire student
body. Not one of the men and women
who compose the large number of under
graduates has refused to add his or her
signature. Names have been added day
by day with a readiness which only goes
to show that the matter is one over which
the members of the university feel deeply
concerned. All the students are united In
wishing to have Masters reinstated.
President Martin Kellogg was seen in
his office in South Hall this afternoon and
presented with the request and its long
fist of signatures attached. The president
up to this time has persistently declined
to discuss the reasons for Masters' dis
missal. To-day, however, he explained to
the committee who waited upon him with
the petition that it was the tone and atti
tude which the Blue and Gold had as
sumed toward the women students of the
college that had prompted the faculty's
action. :.v; _...\,r
"There "are faults and ldlosyncracles
which our professors may have," he said,
"and which we do not pretend to excuse.
It is a question how far those may be
made a legitimate Held for the satire of
the editor of the college annual's pen.
Well-meaning fun no one would object to.
But the Blue and Gold this year has
shown affront to the women of the uni
versity which is, to gay the least, un
gentlemanlv, and it was that particularly
which we felt deserving of censure."
Whether the faculty will be favorably
disposed toward the petition offered for
their consideration must remain to be
seen. The fact that it bears the signa
tures of practically all the women stu
dents in college may have some weight in
determining its disposal.
IS NOT A SVENGALI.
Dr. Anderson Pleads Not Guilty and
Tells How He Bathed His
Accuser's Feet.
OAKLAND, May 2. -Dr.' H. L. Ander
sen, the advertising Gollcitor charged with
practicing medicine without a license, ap
peared In the Police Court to-day and
pleaded not guilty, asking for a jury trial.
His case was set for May 11. Anderson
Bays that his arrest at the instance of
W. A. Boscow is "a piece of spite work,"
and he laughs at the published story of
his having exercised a hypnotic influence
over Mrs. Boscow.
"I do not know anything about the hyp
notic science," said Anderson to-day, "and
1 would not know how to begin. It is all
nonsense. Mr. Boscow's treatment of his
wife, while my wife and I stopped at their
house was of the worst kind and when
Mrs. Boscow threatened to bring suit for
a divorce we advised her to try and get
along with him for the sake of the chil
dren. â  :
"Boscow has treated me disgracefully.
Why, I have spent hours bathing his feet
with warm water and applying other rem
edies trying to make him well and this
is the way he repays me. I have never
made it my business to practice medicine,
though I am a regularly licensed physi
cian and I never Svengalled a person in
my life." . â _ . Â«.*v.
Son Against Father.
OAKLAND, May 2.â The latest develop

Thomas C. Armstrong and his wife,
which, have reached the courts in a suit
to have canceled certain deeds covering
property valued at $15,000 and which the
husband claims to have executed when
he thought he was about to die, is the
arrest of their son, Samuel P. Armstrong,
on a charge -of battering the father.
It appears that tho elder Armstrong

Major McLaughlin Is Not in the Confidence of the New

to a seat Matt Quay of Pennsylvania.
Recent events convince Senator
George C. Perkins and U. S. Grant Jr.
that an alliance has been formed be
tv.o.en Governor Gage and Colonel
Burns which contemplates ihe Candi
da* y of the Governor to succeed Per
kins in the Senate four years hence.
While the supporters of U. S. Grant

"War was not declared on all who es
poused the cause of Grant. Senator
Perkins was. however, sharply criti
cised fur appointing a man like Colonel
J. P. Jackson to the office of Collector
of the P.*rt. The point was advanced
that Jackson, the holder of a lucrative
Federal office, contributed not one dol
lar to the Republican State Central
Committee. In reply to these com
ments Colonel Jackson remarked that
he contributed to the campaign, but did
not give to the committe*. as he de
sired his contribution to go where his
confidence was reposed.
There was a fixed opinion at Sacra
mento that Perkins was favorable to
Grant as the election of the San Diego
man would satisfy the south and leave
the field clear for the election of a
north man to fill the next vacancy
in the Senate. Jn this manner Perkins
expected to smooth the way for his own
re-election.
As explained to The Tall, the alliance
of Gage and Bui for Senatorial
honors does not embrace Major Mc-
Laughlin, chairman of the Republican

that the Major has not been advised of
the deal. Senator Perkins' suspicions

were not excited until he went south to
attend the Free Harbor celebration.
Some facts were then brought to his
knowledge that opened his eyes. Even
then he was not convinced, but after a
conference with IT. S. Grant, which took
place in this city one day last week, the
Senator dismiss all doubt "as to the
alliance between Gage and Burns.
The secret as to the compact by which
Gage is to succeed Perkins must have
been divulged by some one high in the
councils of the Southern Pacific. The
fact that Senator Perkins received an
invitation to the recent banquet does
not signify that he is in the confidence
of Huntington and Herrin in political
matters. It is known that U. S. Grant
has powerful friends in the East, and a
word from New York may have been
Hashed over the wire.
The assertion that Major McLaughlin
has not been taken into the confidence ,
of Gage and Burns will not create in
tense surprise. The Major Is rated as a
good man for certain lines of work
He is exceptionally good to amuse big
public men who come to California for
recreation and intellectual rest. It is
not certain that Hervey Bindley has
been taken into camp. While he is re
garded as clever on the surface, he is
rated as deficient in depth.
The Grant men throughout the State
maintain an organization, and propose
to be ready to meet any scheme to elect
Burns in extra- session of the Begila
ture. Their main hope now is that the
United States Senate -will not seat Mr.
Quay of Pennsylvania.
KILLING OF SEALS
STILL CONTINUES
POINT REYES HERD PICKED OFE
ONE AT A TlMii.
Many Half Grown Animals Attempt
to Reach the Old Rookeries
Only to Be Sent to Their
Death.
The killing of the sea lions at the Point |
Reyes rookeries is still going on merrily. I
Yesterday Deputy Al Wilson telephoned
to Secretary J. P. Babcock that he is find- j
Ing enough of these fish killers at the
point to keep him busy for a day or so,
although the herd has been scattered from
the rocks upon which they used to bask
unmolested. The fusillade of Monday
was a jar to their nerves, from which they
have not recovered, but many are anxious
to get back, and consequently they fall
| victims of the rifles when they start out
on tours to prospect their old home. In
order to make things Interesting Mr. Wil
son says that he has constructed a rock
blind at the nearest point to the "roost
ing" place, from which he blazes away at
â  all that come along that way. It is cer
tain that in tins way he will greatly re
duce the herd.
As stated in The Call yesterday, the
rookeries proper are inaccessible from
any point except the water, and there is
but little Inducement for one to approach
the seal ledges from the ocean side. On
most of the tides the currents run toward
the rookeries from the south through ai
deep channel close to the foot of th*- high
cliffs. Nearly all of the prowlers approach
their old home through this channel, and :
as they near the rocks it is their habit to j
frequently rise to the surface to watch i
for dangerous intruders and to see if any
of their kind have been successful in get
ting hack. The result is a short, sharp
report that is carried landward by the
gale- which always blows against the face
of the cliff, and the seal rolls over dead
: with a bullet through its head.
Mr. Wilson's account of recent devel
opments is that the older seals are too
i clever to poke their heads into this dan
i ger, but the half-grown animals, driven <
from the larger breeding rookeries by the
! male monarchs of the herds, are compelled
to seek some place for resting, and they
i run risks that in most cases prove fatal.
These younger fellows are just as greedy
fish killers as any, and their destruction
is of as much importance as any. So far i
it Is difficult to tell exactly the number :
of sea lions killed, hut with the 150 i
slain two months ago and what have been
shot in the present expedition it is safe
to say that it will reach 800, and the game
has not been very plentiful either. Mr.
Wilson will likely keep banging away for
a day or so longer.
AN INCORPORATED CLUB.
i The Sunnyside Hall and Improve
ment Association Organized
Under State Law.
It Is the intention of the members of
the Sunnyside Hall and Improvement As
sociation to bring their organization un
der the dignity of a corporate body. With
this object In view articles of incorpora
tion will be filed with the County Clerk
as soon as they are drawn by the at
torney of the baby organization. The sum
of $2000 is Bel down as being the working
capital of the corporation. Of this amount
$205 has already been listed by the follow
ing members, who will constitute the first
board of directors: W. A. Merrill (chair
man), Gustave Schnee. A. li. Ewell. A.
F. Schneider, H. P. Hanson, John Bar
rett. William B. Pell, Peter Quinn, John
Stammer and John A. Johnson.
(in* of the first acts of the corporation
will be to build its own hall, which had
been decided on at the first .ring held.
The place selected for this site is on Sun
nyside avenue, near Acadia street, and
but two blocks from the San Francisco
and San Mateo electric car line.
This improvement club, previous to its
incorporation, did considerable for the
progress of the Sunnyside district. It
took a leading part in the sewer agitation,
wliich has for its object the constructing
of a leading outlet from Ocean View to
the Mission Ray, following the course of
Islais Creek bed. This and bringing to the
notice of the City Hall officials the neces
. sity of a schoolhouse and portectlon
against fire in the section represented by
it have been the means of drawing offi
cial eyes to this promising suburban part
! of San Francisco.
C. L. A. S. Bazaar a Success.
The. Catholic Ladies' Aid bazaar, which
closes on Saturday night, Id now an as
sured success. Mrs. M. Deane, who [a the
president of the society, so announces.
There was another' large crowd In attend
ance last evening and the booths, voting
contests and auctioneers did a lively busi
ness. One of the fearures of the evening
was the singing of Miss Julia Sullivan
the well-known contralto. Mrs. DeanÂ©
said last night that no attempt was being
made toward giving a long musical pro
gramme for the reason that it interfered
with the business of the bazaar.
The ladles of the society are deeply
grateful to their many friends and the
public generally who by their generosity
nave contributed to the success of the
bazaar. The lunchroom as usual did a
large business. The indications are that
the crowd will continue to attend the

PROFESSIONAL BEGGARS
CAUGHT PLAYING POKER
Julius Klein and Herman Hoffman,
; Two of the Gang Arrested
j Last Week in the Market
; Street Resorts, Get Six Months
; for Begging,
- . â  â  .
JULIUS KLEIN and Herman Hoff
man, two of the gang of poker
players arrested during the raid
a week ago last Monday night,
appeared before Judge Conlan
yesterday and were each sentenced to
six months in the County Jail for be
ing professional beggars. Klein, who
is 21 years of age, burst into tears
when receiving his sentence and was
led from the courtroom in a lachry
mose condition. They were arrested
last Thursday morning at McAllister
and Buchanan streets by Policemen
Cullinan and Geiman, who had
watched them going from house to
house begging for money or clothes.
The money they received and the
money obtained for clothing which
they sold to secondhand dealers was
utilized In playing poker at the resorts
on Market street. They were so en
gaged when the police raided the re
sorts last week. Klein was among the
men arrested at the Metropoie and
SPREADING THE
GOSPEL OF TOE
BROTHERHOOD
Mission of J. S. Ingalls
to This City.
There are a thousand acres of land up in
Washington which is peopled by the mem
bers of the Co-operative Brotherhood. They
clear the land themselves, they will run
the sawmill which will cut up the timber
they fall and they have already stab
lished a cigar factory, which is adding
materially to the wealth of the little com
munity they are rapidly forming. Mem
bers are being enlisted from all over the
country, and they have grown in number
from the beginning of February, when
the scheme was launched, until now,
when they number over 4000.
The president of the Brotherhood is now
in the cityâ S. Ingallsâ and his mission
J. S. INGALLS, President of the
Co-operative Brotherhood.
is the formation of new branches of the
order in this State. He has already ap
pointed Joseph Asbury Johnson State or
ganizer, and the first steps toward or
ganization will be taken at a meeting to
be held next Saturday night. Then the
plan will be explained to the public and
the proselyting will begin.
The method of operation Is through a
fraternal body, but this has reference
only to the social side of the plan. The
real Idea is embodied in the .colonies to be
formed whenever it Is found possible or
profitable to its members. On the thou
sand acres now in the hands of the Broth
erhood it is hoped to establish a woolen
mill. The sheep will be raised on the
ground by members of the order, the w0..l
will be carded and spun in the mill on the
farm, and the work will be done by mem
bers of the order, and It will be taken to
market in a vessel belonging to the order
and manned by members.
That Is only a start, however, but it
serves to show what the plan contem
plates. The order is divided into two
classes of membershipâ the resident and
the non-resident. The resident are those
who are on the farms and who do the
work; the non-resident are those who be
long to the order and pay a monthy due
for the purpose, and who at the end of
ten years are entitled to a place in the fac
tories of the Brotherhood and support for
themselves and their families. It is one of
the rules of the organization that when
j a member has kept himself in good stand
Hoffman was at the Palace saloon.
They will be defendants In the poker
cases when they are called for trial.
Klein was arrested last January by
Policeman Daly for begging:, and got
thirty days In Jail. The police give
him a bad character.
Judge Conlan, in sentencing the two
men yesterday, said they ought to be
ashamed of themselves. They were
both able-bodied men, but instead of
working for an honest living they pre
ferred to impose upon charitable peo
ple by begging and to spend the money
they received at the poker tables. It
was frauds like them that prevented
many charitably inclined people from
helping the really deserving poor, and
he would give them the full limit the
law allowed him. If the police had
placed a charge of vagrancy against
them, which .should have been done, he
would have given them the extra six
months each.
Both Klein and Hoffman claimed
ing for ten years the order is bound to
take care of him ami give him a chance
to earn his own living, whatever hap
pens.
For compensation the plan provides that
all the working members shall receive
time checks, the value of which will be
determined by the income of the colony.
The by-laws contemplate such an equali
zation of work and hours that one occu
pation will be as desirable as another,
Announcement ! j
We beg to apologize to the large number of our <
patrons throughout the city whose purchases we
were unable to deliver on our 5 o'clock delivery (
yesterday evening. This inability on our part was ,
due to the extraordinary rush of business at our '
establishment yesterday, and we earnestly hope '
that it may be excused by those whose generous
patronage has thus been conferred upon us.
A special delivery of all such delayed packages
will be made at 8 o'clock this morning.
We also rely upon the kindly forbearance of the
large number of our patrons to whom at our coun-
- . ters yesterday we found it impossible to give
more prompt attention.

that they were forced to beg in the
first instance, as they lost all their
money at the poker tables. They got
so infatuated with the game that they
lost all desire for work and hoped to
always win back the money they had
lost with the money they got by beg
ging. They had a regular, system and
had a list in their pockets of the
houses they had called at, so that they
would not make a mistake in going the
second time with probably a different
story.
and in that way the time checks will be
of equal value.
There la much more to the plan, but the
underlying principle is one that aims to
secure for the laborer the greatest return
for the labor he expends. The plan is in
its infancy and the farm in Washington
is the only one so far established, but if
it prove successful others will be estab
lished as the growth of the members war
rants.

Local Merchants Lose
Their Fight.
REDUCED RATES OFFERED
BARS ARE DOWN TO A FLOOD
OF EASTERN COMPETITION.
Great Northern and Northern Pacific
Go Back on the Agreed Sched
ule on Less Than Car
load Lots.
The big hardware and grocery jobbers
of the East are again free to send their
men and their goods into the West to
enter into active and ruinous competition
with the wholesalers on this side of the
Rockies.
The bars that for nearly a year have
held out Eastern dealers from Paciflc
Coast territory were let down on Monday
by the Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific railroads by the adoption of a de
creased tariff on less than carload lots of
freight of mixed classifications.
In an exclusive story in The Call on
Friday last it was stated that the mer
chants of this city had been given the tip
that the two big northern roads were
about to throw down the agreement en
tered into by them last May with the
other transcontinental lines that met in
Milwaukee at that time. They pledged
themselves to a higher rate on less than
carload lots on westbound freight and by
doing so lifted the unjust burden of East
ern competition from the shoulders of
coast merchants. It was further told
that the merchants here had every reason
to believe that their information was au
thentic and that, working upon that be
lief, the different associations were hold
ing almost daily meetings to discuss
plans for holding off the threatened in
vasion.
Their agents were In constant commu
nication with the influential jobbers in
Seattle and Tacoma, and with different
correspondents in the north, and a few
days ago a concerted move was made on
] the two roads. To no avail, however. The
i big firms of the East swung, too. a great
, i power, and yesterday the reduced sched
ule went Into effect.
When the Transcontinental Traffic Bu
i reau met in Milwaukee last May it di
vided freight into five classes and on less
i than carload lots raised the rate on da
1 from $2 40 to $4; on class 2 from $2 In to
, ! $2 60: on class 3 from $2 to $2 60; on class
4 from $1 70 to $1 90, and on class 5 from
$1 60 to $165, a schedule that effectually
1 shut out the Eastern firms. â¢';,'_/'
It prevented the retailer and small Job-
I ber on the coast putting in his orders to
. the Eastern firms and the coast whole
salers of a consequence got the business
1 that was justly due them.
The schedule adopted Monday by the
1 northern roads is by no means the old
rate, but another just as bad li umps
i freight noW running under schedules of
from $170 to $3 the hundred pounds into
, a general rate of $1 60. Under it the
' Eastern dealers may mix a cargo of pis
tols or other high freight with a con
' signment of tit. plat.- or other shelf goods
and ship the stuff in tinder the one rate
, of a dollar and a half a hundred
Although the merchants, of this city
, deny that the new rate will have any local
' application or Influence, the matter was
considered of sufficient Importance to
> warrant a number of them holding a
meeting yesterday afternoon and ad
journing to the Southern Pacific offices
for consultation with Mr. Stubbs, au
thority on freight matters no matter how
intricate. There the question was talked
over pro and con, and as a result of ii
the merchants here have no fear that the
Southern Pacific or southern systems will
follow the lead of the other lines.
The question resolves itself for the pres
ent into a proposition concerning solely
the dealers in Seattle. Tacoma, Portland
and Spokane, but the business men of
those towns have stood so stanchly witn
the local merchants in their fight that the
local dealers will now stand with them
and if the combined influence carries the
weight expected it will not be long be
fore the Great Northern and Northern
Pacific will be again swung into the line
of opposition to Eastern competition.
COMPETITION FOR PULLMAN.
Wagner Sleepers to Come West on
New York Central Routings.
The cut made by President "Jim" Hill
of the Great Northern on sleeping car
rates from Missouri River points is to be
not the only competition that Mr. Pull
man and his porters are to have in the
Intermittent snooze business westward.
The Vanderbllt people, operating the New
York Central line and routing through to
this city, Los Angeles and Portland, have
announced that after the middle of the
month they will operate through sleepers
to the West.
As the New York Centra] hauls nothing
but Wagner sleepers the conclusion is
that the palacelike Wagner is to enter the
Western field on Vanderbilt routings at
least, and railroad men are looking to the
near breaking up of the cinch that the
Southern Pacific and friendly lines have
had for so long on sleeping car accommo
dations.
It has been a fact for months past that
unless an eastbound traveler was routed
over the Southern Pacific system or over
lines in which that line participated
largest in profits it has been impossible
to get at call choice sections or state
rooms on Pullman sleepers. These roads
have been permitted to chart In advance
all decent accommodations, and unless a
person car. to sleep over the wheels or
wait a tedious length for a vacancy be
was compelled to so change Ins routing
that the Southern Pacific got its division.
By the system in vogue in the Pullman
offices these roads were permitted to chart
and hold up to within forty-eight hours
of leaving time every section and state
room on eastbound trams, practically
creating a premium on accommodations
and giving them leverage on Eastern rout
ing not held by other lines.
The invasion of the Wagner will likely
nut a stop to such practices and may in
time result in a reduction in the rate
charged at present for being bunkoed out
of a night's sleep by an t^ntfpped porter.
Nickel-in-the-Slot Cases.
Eleven cases of saloon-keepers, charged
with having nickel-in-the-slot machines
on their premises, were called before act

The arrests were made some months ago
and the Judge suggested that the de
fendants should plead guilty and he would
inflict a nominal fine. Prosecuting Attor
ney Carpenter objected to such a propo
sition, but the Judge continued the cases
till to-morrow to enable the defendants
to come to an understanding and promise
not to use the machines again.
