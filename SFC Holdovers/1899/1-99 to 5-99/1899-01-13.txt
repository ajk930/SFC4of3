VOLUME LXXXV-KO. 44.
ALAMEDA'S TRUSTED REPRESENTATIVE
BETRAYER OF HIS CONSTITUENTS
ONE MORE VICTIM GAINED BY
THE SOULLESS CORPORATION
Howard Wright Enrolls His Name on the Black List
of Dan Burns.
A WEAK EXPLANATION CONFESSES DEGRADATION
Notwithstanding the Most Corrupt Senatorial Situation in California's Legislative
History the Ballots Demonstrate the Utter Hopelessness of
the Mexican's Contest.
FROM THE CALL OF TUESDAY.
Burns polled his full strength to-day. The twenty-four votes given him
on the first ballot are all that he has been able to secure by means of his
political influence, the influence of W. F. Herrin of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, the offer of patronage under the control of Governor Gage and intimi
dation offered by a crowd of political highbinders whose reputations are as
unsavory as that of their master. From this time forward any accession of
strength must be gained by bribery. To learn the names of the legislators
who accept the money of Burns and the railroad company in return for their
votes the public has but to watch for the names of those who, from this
time forward, enroll themselves under the Burns banner.

BERKELEY voted for D - M - Burns >
he Having voted for Bulla on the first
and second ballots.
It. .was a spectacle that is, fortunate
ly. ..^â¢â¢!dom â witnessed in a legislative as
semblage. Jilson is new in politics and
the- tempting bribe of a patronage po-
Fltiop was too much for his honesty.
With Wright it was different. With an
unimpeachable record as a legislator
he- was honored with the position of
Speaker of the Assembly, and had he
remained true to the principles that
have -endeared him to his constituents,
he obuld have demanded and would
have- received almost any office within
the. gift of the people of the State. In
ptead, he has elected to cast his lot
V it.h the gamblers, touts, saloonkeepers
and political shysters who form the tail
to Pan Burns' kite.
In doing this Mr. Wright has the
grace /to acknowledge that he is
aware that he has not the support of
a majority of the people who elected
him and whose servant he is. He ad
mits that he was sent to the Legisla
ture to express the will of his con
stituents, hut he acknowledges the
betrayal of his trust and declares his
intention to turn a deaf ear to the
prayers of his people.
Beyond tl,- fall of Wright and the
d^fegtion of Assemblyman O. H. Huber
of Los AnjjeleÃ. to whom more extended
reference Will be made in this story, the
Senatorial situation remains un- â 
changed. Burns' weakness was dis
eiowd on Tuesday and the events of ;
ye.sterday and to-day have only served j
tcaccentuate it.
The man from Mexico came to Sacra
mento with the strength of the South
ern Pacific Company behind him; with j
f he control of the patronage of Gov- I
ernor Gage; with a following of polit- !
leal heelers from every town and city j
In th* State and with the boast that he I

had enough votes a nd_to spare to elect
him "United' States Senator. .Now, after
five ballots . have been taken/? he can
only show a miserable total of twenty
six votes, and to retain these he has
had to resort to every artifice known
to political tricksters. â¢
The Senatorial situation, as it exists
to-day, is in one sense more . corruDt
than any that has ever disgraced the
legislative history of the State. Every
wirepuller, Federal ever disgraced the
dative history of the State. Every
puller. Federal official and politi
cal pap-sucker in the State has been
brought to Sacramento to assist in pro
moting Burns' candidacy. Besides other
influence it required the efforts of four
Justices of the Supreme Court to pull
Howard E. Wright from a path of
t rectitude and honor and force him to
1 say the words that seal the sentence of
his own political ruin. So much is ac
knowledged by Wright himself.
I the words that seal the sentence of
own political ruin. So much is ac
wledgod by Wright himself,
One of these eminent jurists is Su
preme Justice McFarland. He has tem
porarily deserted the bench where the
cause of the people is so neglected that
it requires months and sometimes years
to secure a hearing," to come to Sacra
mento to do the bidding of the railroad
company, whose servant he is. and of
Dan Burns, who is his master. The
Call opposed the nomination of this
man and did nothing to secure his
election for reasons stated at the time
of the meeting of the convention, and
the truth of â  which is now made ap
parent. . /
Of Assemblyman O. â¢ H. . Huber there
is much to say, and none of it is to his
credit. He came to Sacramento under
instructions from his county i conven
tion to support Bulla. Last night he
attended a caucus of the Bulla forces
and positively and specifically agreed
to remain true to Bulla until a major
ity of the caucus subscribed to the same
agreement. To-day Huber voted once
for Bulla and then, without notifica
tion of his intentions, deserted the
Bulla camp and went over to Grant.
The breach of faith was so flagrant
as to lay Mr. Huber liable to the im
putation that he has accepted of the
good things intentions, deserted is
camp and went over to Grant,
breach of faith was so flagrant
lay Mr. Huber liable to the im
ion that he has accepted of the
things that the San Dlegan is
creOited with handing out to those who
promise to support his candidacy. Such
charges are being made openly here
to-night,^ and when Mr. i Huber goes
home to his constituents he will have
to make some explanations that may
prove embarrassing.
Three ballots . taken to-day in joint
convention --demonstrated the utter
hopelessness^ of the Burns cause in the
Senatorial struggle. ; After all the
boastings and vauntings of strength in
reserve to be displayed as the voting
progressed the Candelaria colonel could
not muster on the third ballot to-day
more than twenty-six votes.. Even the
touts were chagrined when the motion
to adjourn came from the Burns camp
and was resisted by the Grant men in
the convention.
Poor Howard E. Wright, the man. in
whom the people of Alameda once re
posed confidence, cc-uld hardly utter the
words which signified his disgrace. .
" In the State library immediately pre
ceding the session of the convention
Bulla and Wright had high words.
When the Speaker asserted that he had
not solemnly promised to stand by
Bulla from the first to- the last Senator
Bulla replied: "You lie." The Speaker
said in a tone of resignation: "It can
not be helped." In some circles con
tempt is expressed. for Wright, but the
general expression is one of profound
sympathy. It is clear to all that he
know the path of. honor and duty, but
did not have ' the courage and manli
ness to follow it. The pressure of the
politicians ; was .too great for his . weak
character â to resist. The applause of
the touts, '; which â  proclaimed to the au
dience assembled In the Capitol the
news that his public career, once ,so
promising and bright, had ended in
shame and degradation, was not music
to the ears of the Speaker. â¢ .

SPEAKER WRIGHT'S SUPPORTERS
SAY HE HAS DISGRACED THEM
The Recalcitrant Assemblyman Bitterly Denounced
by Former Friends.
NO TERMS TOO STRONG FOR HIS CONDEMNATION
Republicans in All Parts of His District Express Their Humiliation Over the
Disgrace Which Has Been Cast Upon Them by Their Trusted
Representative in the Legislature.
WRIGHT'S FORMER FRIENDS DENOUNCE HIM.
Hundreds of the former friends and supporters of Speaker Howard
Wright in his district yesterday expressed themselves in strongest terms
of condemnation of his action in voting for D. M. Burns for United States
Senator, and from those expressions it is readily seen that the young man
has dug his political grave by betraying the trust placed in him by the people
of Alameda County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 12.
The announcement that Speaker How
ard Wright had cast his vote for United
! States Senator for Dan M. Burns ere
! ated such surprise in this county that
th*Â» information required substantiat
ing before it was believed.
Assemblyman Wright's present home
in East Oakland and his old home
at Berkeley, which two places consti
tute his Assembly district, were more
shocked than if an earthquake had vis
ited them.
This Assembly district Is one of the
most substantial and conservative in
the county, and it has always sent to
the Legislature a map with a record for
honesty and steadfastness. Two years
agn Mr. Wright waÂ§ elected to the As
sembly, and his career in the last Legis
lature led his supporters to believe that
the estimate they had formed of his
character was correct, and when he ex
pressed a desire to succeed .himself he
found little difficulty in being re
elected.
Throughout the campaign Mr. "Wright
made many speeches and caused it to
be well known that he was against Mr.
De Young for United States Senator.
He made this declaration in the streets
of Berkeley, and on several occasions he
declared that no one affiliated with the
railroad company should be accorded
his vote for Senator. Mr. Wright's
initial vote on the question for Senator
Bulla was regarded as evidence that he
intended to keep his ante-election prom
ises. When he followed this up by vot
ing on the second day for Bulla his dis
trict was satisfied that it could trust
him.
When he was assailed by the Burns
followers and charged with being a
traitor to Burns, to whom it was al
leged he had promised his vote, hun
dreds of his warmest supporters flocked
to his defense, and were perfectly will
ing to go on record as expressing their
utmost confidence in their Assembly
man. More than this, they repudiated,
on Mr. Wrights assertion that it was
so, the statements of the Burns men
that he was tied up to the railroad com
pany, and that as time went by he
would be found in the Burns camp.
These assurances of support and these
many offers of defense were hardly ut
tered ere the news came that Speaker
Wright had fulfilled the prediction of
his enemies and had disgraced himself
and betrayed his district.
When the first spasm of surprise had
passed away indignation was rampant,
and hundreds of the very best men in
Mr. Wright's Assembly district de
nounced in unmeasured terms the ac
tion of their representative. No one
acquainted with the public feeling in
Berkeley or East Oakland can possibly
argue that there is the least kindly
feeling toward Mr. Burns in those dis
tricts. Mr. Burns' character and meth
ods of doing politics are as far re
moved from the character of the men
whom the Seventh Ward and Berkeley
would have to represent them in the
United States Senate as Maguireism is
removed from McKinleyism. Having
lived in the district many years, and'
having ably represented it in one J^gis
lature, Mr. Wright knew, and It was
his duty to know, perhaps better than
any other individual, that Mr. Burns
is not the choice of that large district.
Further down in this article will be
found expressions of opinion concerning
Mr. Wright from men who stand high
est in the Republican party in the
Speaker's Assembly district. These
men are neighbors, and have been sup
porters and admirers of Mr. Wright.
In their own words they express sur
prise, indignation and abhorrence of
the action of their representative at
Sacramento tn-day.
After surprise and indignation, curi
osity was aroused, and everybody was
demanding to know why Mr. Wright's
position on such an important matter
had changed. No valid reason could b'^
suggested and several arguments were
made that would not have been pleas
ing to Mr. Wright, and which that gen
tleman might consider lilielous if he
saw them in print.
Neither was the situation improved
to any marked extent when an after
noon paper published an "explanation"
which Mr. Wright had given to a re
porter in Sacramento. Mr. Wright's
explanation is as follows:
"For over a week I have been engaged
in investigating carefully the charges
made by the newspapers against Colonel
Burns, and I am ready to say that I be
lieve them to be unqualifiedly false. I
mean the charges that he was short in
his accounts in Yolo County and else
where and that he is a desperate crim
inal.
"Yes, I had opportunities for Investiga
tion this week which I did not have be
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
fore, because a quantity of data has been
put into my hands by business men and
others, residents of Yolo County, wno
have come to me and told me that tne
stories are absolutely false. If the Sena
torial election should be left to the peo
ple of Yolo County I believe they would
decide in favor of Colonel Burns by an
overwhelming' majority.
"The people of Alameda County also
would decide in favor of Burns if they
understood him as I do. Assemblyman
Pierce of Yolo, who has known Hurmi
since childhood, was one of the sources
of my information. Pierce ip a graduate
of the State University, and a man of
high character.
"I have received from most authentic
sources information that a majority of
the members of the Supreme Court are
advocating the election of Burns. A great
many of the prominent business men of
San Francisco, with whom I am asso
ciated, are for him. Some of the residents
of my own district also have spoken to
me of Burns, but I cannot mention their
names without arousing comment.
"I believe that Burns is the best fitted
man for the Senatorship. No man is more
loyal to his friends. He is a man of
trained mind and has great organizing2
ALAMEDANS DENOUNCE SPEAKER WRIGHT
abilities. He can do more for "the State
than any one else. I want the people of
my district to study Burns and know him
as 'l have learned to know him, and then,
they will not disapprove of my course."
. This "explanation" was the blow that
stung almost as bitterly as the first an
. nouncement that Wright "had gone to
Burns." Mr. Wright will certainly be
called upon to mention the names of
those people in his district who spoke
to him of Burns, but whose names he
could not give "without arousing com
ment." â¢ A thorough canvass of the two
sections of Mr. Wright's district fails
to reveal a single man of standing in
the community or whose opinion has
weight in the councils of the Repub
lican party who does not stand ready
to denounce openly the aspirations of
Mr. Burns, and of the men who are
â¢ helping to crown California with dis
grace in the United States Senate.
Certainly there i? no desire to follow
Mr. Wright's example and to favor
Burns "if they understood him as I do."
Neither does anybody in Mr. Wright's
district thank him for the suggestion
"I want the people of my district to
-study Burns and know him as I have
learned to know him." whatever that
may indicate. When Mr. Wright re
turns to Oakland he will certainly be
called upon to explain how he came to
"know Mr. Burns." whom he has been
acquainted with but a short time, to the
. exclusion of his knowledge of the peo
ple who sent him to Sacramento to
honor them and himself.
Nor are there those who are slow to
remark that Mr. Wright has been part
ly cajoled and browbeaten by those
Burns men who charged him with rep
resenting a church district of "rice eat
ers â¢nd long hairs." who believe in
lengthy prayers and smart turns of
business, and to whom Dan Burns Is
like a son of Belial.
There are yet some who believe that
when I.ir. Wright realizes how: abso
lutely repulsive his action is to his sup
porters and how thoroughly antagonis
tic everything suggestive of or con
nected with Dan Burns is to his As
sembly district, he will remedy his fa
tal mistake and regain the esteem of
his friends. In the meantime his ac
tion is the foremost subject of conver
sation throughout this end of the coun~
try-
ALL OF ONE MIND.
Bow Speaker Wright's Action Is
Viewed by Bis District.
CITY ATTORNEY DOWâ I have been
elected to office by the Republican party
from Mr. Wright's Assembly District for
six years, and 1 think I know the feeling
of that district. It is certainly and al
most unanimously against Mr. Burns and
all that he represents;. Speaker Wright,
who lives in my ward, knows this as well
as I 80, and knows that he is not repre
senting- his district when he votes for Mr.
â¢Burn?. His doing so is a great surprise
to me.
JUDGE A. W. BISHOPâ I cannot
think what could have induced Mr.
Wright to so thoroughly debase him
self and destroy his political future
by voting for Burns. I should have
thought that his family connections,
if nothing else, would have kept the
young man from taking such a false
step. I cannot make myself believe
Wright is in earnest and yet hope
that he will redeem himself and show
his manhood and loyalty to this
county by repudiating all connection
with Burns.
ATTORN KY W. H. WASTEâ I have
lived In Berkeley a long time and want
through the State University and per
haps know the feeling of that tuvn as
well as anybody. If Mr. Burns was the
last man on earth for the place I believe
Berkeley would sooner we California's
seat in the Benate vacant than t<> have it
filled by Dan Burns.. Mr. Wright replied

along with every other Republican in this

I would not hav< 1 Wright
known that he might be likely to vote
for Burns.
DR. N. K. FOSTER, M. D., resid
ing at 1266 Twenty -third avenue, is
a good Republican who voted,
worked and shouted for Howard
Wright during the last campaign.
At that time he considered Wright
one of the best men available for the
high honor of Assemblyman, and he
regarded him as a man standing al
ways on the side of the people. Here
is what he said to-day:
"If Howard Wright thinks more
of the 'Railroad Push' tnan he does
of the people he was sent to represent,
all right; but he will find out his mis
take very soon. If the Lord will only
forgive me for voting for Wright I
will never do so again. I am really
sorry that Wright has voted for
Burns for Senator and his action has
caused the biggest kind of a surprise
in this district."
J. W. EVANS â I never supposed that
Wright would vote for Dan Burns. Really
| I can't see now where the Inducement
! came in for him to do so. J have feH
. great pleasure in the fact that he was
not voting for Burns, and I presume
i everybody else in this district felt llke
' wise. I don't understand why he changed,
nor does anybody else know. I am really
sorry be did bo, and I am confident that
i if he should run for the Assembly to-mor
row, the people knowing what they do
now. he could never again be elected. ]
do not like to denounce Wright, for I
!do not know his motives. Of late I have
heard that Wright might be found on the
i side of Burns and that Burns secured him
! the Speakership, but I would not be
! lieve it.
HARRY A. MELVIN. Chief Deputy
: District Attorneyâ lf Dan Burns has the
i Seqatorship he must have had the votes
. to give to Howard Wright for the Speak-
I ership. Of course, when the people voted
i for Wright, Dan Burns was not thought
of for Senator. I still hope for the best,
and it wouldn't surprise me, If the work
of The Call and Chronicle will yet result
in the election of a man like General
Barnes.
W. C. MASON, 366 East Fourteenth
} streetâ l didn't suppose he would vote for
Burns. It simply shows to my mind that
Wright does not represent this district,
and if ho should run for the Assembly to
morrow there wouldn't be a corporal's
guard who would vote for him, knowing
Be was for Dan Burns. I think Wright
might have discussed his position on the
United States Senatorial fight when he
-first came out for the Assembly, and then
we would have known what to do.
REV. C. M. HILL, Pastor of the
Tenth Avenue Baptist Church â I re
gard it a disgrace that a county of
Alameda's standing, intellectually
and morally, should be betrayed by
any of its representatives voting for
such a man as Colonel Dan Burns. I
consider that the election of a man
like Burns to the United States Sen
atorship would be a shame and a dis
grace to the civilization of California.
Surely, I cannot see how Asseblyman
Wright can feel that he represents
the convictions of the people of this
district when he casts his ballot for
Dan Burns. It is shameful.
REV. J. R. KNODELL, pastor of Pil
prim Congregational Churchâ l have no
use for any man who will delib
erately cast his vote for this man
Burns for I/Viited States Senator. That
is my opinion Bummed up as brief as
possible. I am chairman of a reform or
ganization, and I know how the good peo
ple feel in this matter. "We all worked so
zealously for Howard Wright's election to
the Assembly that we now feel disgusted
over his action in voting for Burns for
United States Senator. I know that we
. would not have done so had we enter
tained any idea that Wright was going to
. do as he did.
FRANK ADAMS, Deputy County
i Clerkâ Well. I am curprised, to say the
1 least, and I do not see how those who
have spoken and written so favorably of
Wright can conciliate matters. 1 think
now that Wright should be hit as hard as
possible. Yet. when I come to look back
and consider how easily Howard Wright
walked into the Speakershlp, don't you
know it seemed very strange and even
: suspicious? There can be no doubt but
that the Burns camp knew where he stood
all the time.
REV. A. T. NEEDHAM, pastor of
the Eighth Avenue M. E. Churchâ
; Any man who votes for Daniel M.
Burns to represent California In tne
United States Senate does not, yea, he
; cannot, voice the sentiment of this dis
trict, and if Howard Wright has done this
it Is disgraceful. If the Republican party
votes for and indorses for United States
: Senator such a man as Dan Burns it
bodes party ruin. The party is doomed
I to certain ruin if it indorses Burns.'
REV. W. W. FREAR, Represent
ing the Congregational Foreign Mis
sionary Work on the Pacific Coast â
Wright's action in supporting Dan
Burns for United btates Senator is a
shame and a disgrace to this district.
DR. W. J. WILCOXâ To say that lam
H'.iri.rised is putting It mildly. Why, I
thought from the start that Wright "was
i for F.irnes Nothing was ever further
: from my mind than to realize that Wright
I has voted foi Burns. I think It was notn
ing less than foolish on his nan. Hy his
action in this contest Wright shows
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. JAN U ART 13, 1899.
short sightedness and very poor politics,
to say the least.
W. H. FIFIELDâ I feel that our As
semblyman, Howard Wright, has dis
graced himself. Mr. Wright no longer
represents his constituents at all. His
statement in an interview wherein he says
that he thinks he represents his district
by voting for Dan Burns is all false on
his part. It is awful and I don't believe
that any one would vote for Wright to
morrow if he should be running for office.
I say that I do not believe a man in this
county cotild be elected to represent the
people in the Legislature should he be
known to favor Burns for United States
Senator. Wright has simply disgraced
himself. ' â¢ . ,
GEORGE D. METCALF-W right has
done very wrong. He has not represented
his interest. Berkeley considers itself
grossly betrayed. The feeling against
Wright's action Is fully as three to one.
GEORGE SCHMIDTâ This thing is
outrageous. Speaker Wright should know
what Berkeley wants. He lived here long
enough to know. Burns is not our choice
and Wright knows it. Burns wants six
ty-one votes and in my opinion Wright
is just a dummy who is doing Burns' bid
ding.
DR. W. W. ALLENâ Wright's conduct
is very disappointing ajid very unsatis
factory- He would not have been elected
had he been suspected of being in the
Burns camp. Xo one in Berkeley wants
Burns andr-fi vote for him does us a great
injustice. â 
JUDGE GEORGE R. WILLIAMS,
Chairman of the Republican City-
Central Committeeâ What is my
opinion of Howard Wright's action in
voting for Dan Burns P Why, you can
say that I don't approve of it at all.
I was very much surprised when I
heard he had voted for Burns for
United States Senator. I don't think
his constituents approve of his action
either. Had we known before the
election last November that Wright
was going to vote for Burns we
would not have sent him to represent
us. I feel perfectly disgustel and
that doesn't half express my feel
ings.
DR. J. S. EASTMANâ I am greatly dis
appointed and cannot understand what
Wright is thinking about. Most certainly
we are not satisfied. There is nothing in
common between Burns and Assembly
man Wright's district.
E. S. GRAYâ Assemblyman Wright has
done wrong. If he wants to know how
we wish him to vote we will at once in
form him. He says some of his constitu
ents have spoken to him of Burns. For
every one that may have mentioned
Burns there are a hundred opposed to
him. Wright cannot claim to represent
Berkeley and vote for Burns for United
States Senator.
F. G. CONKLINâ I hardly know what
to say. lam very much astonished. I
thought better of Howard "Wright than
that. I suppose now we may as well
send Burns to the Senate, as we cannot
send him to San Quentin. I feel that
the action of Howard Wright is a dis
grace to the State.
L. X. COBBLEDICKâ Howard "Wright
would not have got my vote if I thought
he was going to act this way. I think
the whole affair was done as a trade.
Burns was probably behind the move
ment when Wright was nominated for the
Spc-akership. Wright is hot representing
his district in any way. There is no
(juestion as to that. Ido not think Cali
fornia would be well represented by
Burns. There are plenty of other good
men we could send to the Senate. Burns
has done nothing to recommend him be
sides figuring as a political boss. I guess
Howard Wright will not represent the
Fifty-first Assembly District after this
term. The people will not stand for such
actions.
R. H. CHAMBERLAINâ I am very
much surprised, indeed. I think the
change 'must have been made for some
other purpose than a good one, although
I do not want to cast reflections upon Mr.
Wright. I was glad when I saw that he
did not vote for Burns in the first two
ballots, and 1 am very sorry he has gone
over now. The people of Alameda will
suffer for his action. It was a very flimsy
excuse for him to say that several of his
constituents had asked him to vote for
Burns. Why don't he stand by himself.
He should have some stamina and back
bone. I think Burns would make a very
poor representative of California,
T. H. WAKEFIELDâ It is just as I ex
pected. The railroad people knew who
they were nominating when they put
Wright up. He is representing railroad
interests instead of those of the people.
The railroad controls fifty men in this
ward, and they knew what they were do
ing in nominating Wright. He has not
carried out the supposed wishes of his
constituents. I have no doubt that W.
Baker and the railroad people knew how
Wright would stand before they nomi
â¢nated him.
M. S. HAMILTONâ Wright ought to be
kicked out of the community. He has
not acted fair to those who elected him.
Of course he went to the Legislature un
pledged, but he knew the general senti
ment of the district. My opinion is that
neither Grant nor Burns will get elected.
However, of the two, I would prefer
Grant.
PROFESSOR J. T. WALLACEâ It is an
outrage. I am mortified, as a citiaen of
California, when a man who Is a graduate
of the State University can fall down like
that. It is a disgrace to the State of
California. His going over to Burns will
probably have a bad effect on some of
the others. I suppose Wright is repre
senting race track interests as much as
anything else. He certainly is not repre
senting the intelligent class in the com
munity by any means. It is a shame that
a man will go there and act like that,
when there are so many good men in the
district who would be honored by the posi
tion. In a way I gave my indorsement
to Wright before his election. I was Sec
retary of the Anti-saloon League when
it indorsed several of the candidates,
Wright among the number.
H. M. CAMERONâ It is certainly an
outrage. That is all I can say. I was
not disappointed in his action, because I
was expecting it from the way he was
hanging fire. He has in no way expressed
the sentiments of the people of this ward.
There is no use In my saying anything
further. If Wright was here, though. I
would say more to him. I am afraid
there are more hanging back like Wright
was.
C. H. DALYâ I was very much aston
ished when I heard Wright had rone over
to Burns. I suppose he had good reasons
for the change. He probably owes his
speakership to Burns. I don't think his
constituents are pleased with the way
he has acted, although I am sure he made
no pledges. I think Wright was honest
in his flop, if you may call it such. There
are a great many people beginning to
think that Burns has been misrepresented
and that he would probably make a good
Senator.
H. P. CAPELL â You can express my
disapproval of Wright's action in just as
strong terms as you like. I am exceed
ingly disappointed in him. I am satisfied
he owes his chairmanship to the sup
port from the Burns contingent. He has
done nothing to show that he has been
representing those who elected him.
G. H. CHICK, Berkeleyâ To say I am
surprised at Wright's flop is putting it
mildly. Wright has disgraced himself
and even.' body that voted for him has
been betrayed. What will be the opinion
of the university town when it is known
that our representative voted for Dan
Burns?
JOHN E. BOYDâ Assemblyman W r right |
has betrayed the confidence of the people |
of Berkeley, and if he were to come up
again for re-election he would not re
ceive a handful of votes. I cannot under
stand him at all. He has done so well in
the past that there must be some mate- !
rial reason for his sudden change of j
heart. Perhaps one may some day learn i
the secret.
E. P. BANCROFTâ I would like ' to be
one of the number to tar and feather the '
man who voted for Burns. Three of j
Berkeley's leading menâ J. W. Richards, j
G. H. Chick and Professor Boone â had j
the utmost confidence in him and vouched j
for his integrity, and all have been greatly
disappointed, as Wright promised he
would not vote for Burns. I consider we
have been grossly betrayed, and Wright
has covered himself with dishonor.
CITY TRUSTEE J. W. RICHARDS.
Berkeleyâ l am far from satisfied with
Speaker Wright's conduct, and I know !
that the people of this district feel as I j
do. Burns is not our choice and Wright
knows it as well as anybody. A short
time before the Legislature convened Mr.
Wright came to me and asked my opinion |
concerning the sentiment of the Republi- j
cans here about the Senatorship. I told
him emphatically that I thought the Re
publicans here would feel it a lasting
disgrace If their representative in the As- I
sembly should vote for Burns. I told him j
that his constituency here would look
upon Burns' election as one of the dark
est stains upon the Republican party in
this State. And this is not for reasons
Of party policy merely. It is because we
fvtl that Burns is altogether unworthy
of the high office which he seeks, and
that such a man would ruin the policy
and prevent the further succees of the
party, that we asked Mr. Wright to vote
against him.
J. NTCHOLSOXâ Berkeley has no more
use for Howard Wright. We used to like
him and trusted him, but he has proved
to be unable to appreciate our confidence.
GEORGE LOWâ Anybody who would
vote for Dan Burns is an enemy of Cali
fornia. W-right was not elected to vote
for him. but to represent this district,
and I know how Berkeley feels to-niprht.
Professor boone. Berkeley
BOARD OF EDUCATIONâ I expressed
myself yesterday, and you can juiiere of
my surprise and indignation from wh;it I
said then. Here it Is: "I know nothing
of Wright's political relations with Mr.
Burns and the railroad; but I know
mighty well enough to know this, that he
has a'mind of his own: that he is true to
his convictions; that he never promised
Mr. Burns his vote; that if he hail he
would have voted so. Wright is no cow
ard, and he cannot be intimidru-d. His
constituency must ndmire him for his in
dependence, whether it be the result of
politics or of 'church' influence. Let it go
at the latter. Berkeley and Oakland are
willing, and T think Wright can stand it."
A BILL TO CREATE
STATE HIGH SCHOOL FUND
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 12.â Assemblyman Cami
netti this morning introduced into the As
sembly a bill that provides for the crea
tion of a State high school fund and a
State tax of 2 cents on every hundred dol
lars of assessable property, the proceeds
to be used for school purposes. All moneys
derived from said tax must annually be
divided by the Superintendent of Public
Instruction equally among the several
counties and cities and counties of the
State.
The amount so apportioned muet be ex
pended for support of a county or city
and county high school, and the Board of
; Education may divide the amount ap
{ portioned in each county or city and
I county among all high schools in its
! jurisdiction. As a condition precedent to
the receipt of this aid strict compliance
with the following provisions of the act
is required:
That all buildings and other require
ments for a high school be furnished and
kept in order without expense to tho
State; that a course of study approved by
the Superintendent of Public Instruction
shall be taught therein; that all gradu
ates of grammar schools In the county
be entitled to enter as students therein;
the County Superintendent of Schools
must annually and oftener If required re
port to the Superintendent of Public In
j struction the condition of all high schools
in his county.
The Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion or a deputy must visit once in each
year all high schools receiving State aid
â¢nd prescribe a course of instruction
therefor calculated to prepare "pupils for
admission to the agricultural, mining or
scientific departments of the University
of California, as well as for the practical
duties of life."
The moneys shall be paid to each county
quarterly by order of the Superintendent
of Public Instruction. The bill was given
its first reading and referred to the Edu
cation Committee.
FOR THE ERECTION OF
AN EXECUTIVE MANSION
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 12. - This session of the
Legislature will be called upon to deter
mine whether the State shall provide a
sujtable home for the Governor. Senator
Doty of Sacramento introduced a biU to
oay appropriating $55,000 for the erection
of an executive mansion to be completed
within two years.
Under the terms of the bill a commis
sion consisting of three members, who
sh;ill serve without compensation, but
will be allowed reasonable contingent ex
penses, shall have charge of the construc
tion of the building . The mansion is to
be located on the Capitol grounds and
the architecture shall be in harmony with
the Capitol building. Competitive designs
may be called for and the commission is
authorized to expend $1000 in prizes 'for
designs. Th^ building is to be constructed
of California stone. The bill was referred
to the Committee on Public Buildings.
A bill providing for an executive man
sion has also been introduced in the As
sembly, but it differs from Senator Doty's
measure in that it appropriates $75,000
for the purpose.

BARNES NOT
A RAILROAD
CANDIDATE
Tbe General Denounces the Re
port as a Scheme of His
Enemies.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 12, â Telegrams were re
ceived here to-night from San Fran
cisco to the effect that a story is in cir
culation in the metropolis that General
W. H. L. Barnes is the railroad candi
date and that Sproule and other rail
road men were in a saloon offering to
wager $200 to $500 that Barnes would be
elected.
General Barnes was asked to-night if
there was any truth in the rumor from
the city. He replied: "There is not
a word of truth in it. In my judg
ment the whole thing was planned and
concocted by the enemy at this end
of the line and was designed to prevent
members of the Legislature from com
ing to my support in this contest. The
story on its face is false. In the first
place William Sproule is not a sport
ing or betting man and does not fre
quent saloons. He is a quiet, reserved
business man, whose time is passed
after business hours at his home.
"I am positive," continued the gen
eral, "that this is a scheme to make
the members of the Legislature believe
that I am the railroad's candidate and
by causing this belief restrain them
from voting for me. I am here almost
I alone making this fight. I have with
I me a few loya! and devoted friends, but
\ I have not the support of the State
Central Committee or the push. I have
I not the support of the railroad com
| pany nor have I money or patronage at
jmy disposaJ. My campaign is clean
j and open and can be seen as it is. I
would be glad to receive honorable
support from any quarter and certain
ly would have no objection if friends of
the railroad company should vote for
me. It is my belief that the statement
implying that I am the railroad candl
| date emanated from the enemy here in
| Sacramento. It is absolutely without
truth and was designed by influences
hostile to me."

VICTIM GAINED
Continued from First Page.
has added the name of another bright
and promising young man to its long
list of victims. He will follow in the
road of the outcasts gone before. When
the Legislature adjourns he will be
kept waiting in the anteroom of the
yellow building to see Herrin and tell
him how he sacrificed himself in the
cause of the corporation. A few
crumbs of consolation may be thrown
to him for a month or two. but the
atmosphere will grow colder with each
succeeding visit, arid in the end the
lackeys will not take his card to the
! master. In many a barroom from Sis
j kiyou to San Diego may be seen the
wrecks of young and brilliant men who
made the mistake early in life of serv
ing the corporation instead of the Deo
ple. They tell the story of prosperity
in youth, the early promises of a bril
liant career in the public service, the
fatal error of yielding to the blandish
ments of the railroad corporation and
its agents and the subsequent descend
ing steps to an utterly useless life. The
same old story will be told again as
often as men betray the people.
Mr. Wright made a statement to-day
concerning his reasons, or alleged rea
sons, for surrendering his position in
the eyes of the public In order to enter
the Burns fold. It might as well be
termed his confession, but by whatever
name it is called, it stands for itself
as the pitiful pretense of a man who
sees and knows the error of his ways
and who seeks to justify himself in the
eyes of the public by reciting argu
ments that find no response in his own
heart. It is as follows:
During the past six or seven days I have
been carefully investigating the charges
made against Colonel Burns by the news
papers, with the result that I believe them
to be false, and that he is merely tue vic
tim of enemies who are seeking to destroy
him. Moreover, I believe that the people
of the State of California, if given time,
.will find this out for themselves.
I have received from the most au
thentic source the information that four
members of the Supreme Court are es
pousing the election of Mr. Burns. I do
not care to mention their names without
their permission. I have Seen in close
consultation with Morris M. Estee, whom
the people of California know to be thor
oughly reliable and honest, and the life
long friend of Colonel Burns. I have scru
tinized the character of Burns throueh
the -statement of Mr. Estee very carefully
In addition, I have received p large num
ber of requests from the most prominent
business men in San Francisco asking me
to vote for Mr. Burns, together with many
individual requests from representative
men in my own district. I feel justified
in voting for Mr. Burns in preference .to
any other candidate at this time for these
reasons, and for the further reason that
his trained mind and wonderful organ
izing abilities, his great heart and gen
erous nature, will accomplish in the
Senate of the United States a great good
for the State of California.
( I believe the people of my district
and my county, if given the opportunity
of the same careful investigation I have
had. would, in the majority, agree thpt f
had voted right. And I want to say that
I voted as I did because I believed! it to
be right. The people who know me know
that I give to all public questions the
most serious consideration, and I have
not come uÂ» thia decision suddenly. I iÂ»i
alize that the majority of my constlments
are not favorable to Mr. Burns' candi
dacy, but Just how many are oppos.^ to
him I do not know, for the reason tbÂ»t I
have not had the opportunity of leaning
their preferences. I have satisfied mys-jjf
however, of Mr. Burns' integrity, [n nv '
investigation I have gone through all tie
reports of the alleged shortage in Yoo
County and the alleged shortage in :..-.
Secretary of State's office, and 1 don't be
lieve he had any more to do with these
shortages than I had. If there is any
thing convincing in court records they
should recommend themselves to the peo
ple of California at this time. My last
talk with any one in regard to the Sena
torial situation was with a Judge of tne
Supreme Court, and he expressed a pref
erence for Mr. Burns. I can only say in
conclusion that I am ready to stand or fall
by my decision to-day.
M. M. Estee is now here as the chief
manager of the Burns fight. If Estee
is entitled to any one distinction above
all others it is that of "hoodoo-in-chief"
of every political contest in which he
enters as principal or second. In this
particular instance Burns" cause Is so
bad and his chances of success so slen
der that Estee cannot do him any
harm, but if harm were possible Estee's
blunders would find the way to it.
Governor Gage's enemies ought to en
joy the spectacle of Gage and Estee
working together in a common cause.
Estee, inspired by the Examiner and
Maguire, made one speech in the late
campaign and that one speech did the
Republican cause more injury than all
the efforts of opposition orators com
bined. The talk goes that Burns, in
his despair, may attempt to put Estee
in the race for the Senatorship. The
fact will be recalled that Burns once
managed a Senatorial contest for Estee
and the latter had fifty-four supporters
in the Legislature, but Dan, who then
had money and the reputation of let
ting it go, could not muster six more
votes to gain. Estee's election. The
"hoodoo" hovered around the winning
mark and Estee could get no closer
than fifty-four; Estee himself asserts
that there is no thought of bringing
him into the race. He appears to un
derstand that his political career in
California has closed.
The Burns men have caused it to be
circulated that in the event of a dead
lock by which the Legislature would
fail to elect a United States Senator it
would then be within the power of
Governor Gage to appoint a Senator
and that he would appoint Burns'. This
is merely a sample of the gold bricks
that are being handed out here to
country legislators. The Senate of the
United States has decided in two recent
c?ses, one in Oregon and one in Mon
tana, that if the Legislature fails to
elect a Senator then the place must re
main vacant until the regular session
of the Legislature, the Governor having
no appointing power.

The flood of bills since Tuesday has been
so great that the State Printing Office
has been swamped, and it was given out
to-day that bills Introduced yesterday
were not likely to be sent back this -week.
Among ihe bills tied up is the Cutter
bill, tearing the heart out of the Belshaw

to be done to get this measure up at once,

Election of Dan Burns.
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
f MEXTO, Jan. 12.â T0-day members and
visitors present at the Joint session of
the two houses witnessed a melancholy
.spectacle. Possibly all did not appre-
Cilatt it to the full, but to those who
. did it brought a feeling of sadness. It
whs the fall of a man to whom the
future seemel to hold out much, who
\v-at; respect) I a.s an honorable citizen,
. "'. who- was gi\en fair esteem as a poli
tician at i d and adroit, and
wtiu had an opportunity to write hia
Qfetoie high. He had been given a po-
Bltioh of h :;â  " He had been looked up
: who would not violate the
: â¢ *â¢!>â¢ given to decency. Yet
lie fill. When his name was called he
Vpjed tor Dan Burns. He did it in a
tremulous with a sense of shame
and a face burning. He realized the
dvgrad.ation to which he had sunk, the ;
f.; : : .. -humiliation he had brought upon his
â ':'.' floarest and nearest associates. Never
fi.>.;- s- he voted for Burns, and on each
!â¢.-â¢*â¢ .succeeding ballot emphasized the dis
â . Three times he proclaimed him
jfeli dupe or knave. Three times the
cup was passed to him and he drained
to th<: dregs the draught to his own
: : â  /undoing and his own dishonor. This
man was Howard E. Wright, Speaker
. of the Assembly.
It is impossible not to feel sorry for
Wright; he has sacrificed so much and ]
all for nothing. He has traded his
political birthright for a phantom nn-ss
:.-.â¢ of pottage. He has allied himself to
.Burns, and Buni? is an impossible pre
-4 gumption, a creature of luck and acci
dent and lenient courts. Wright has
forfeited the respect of his former
friends and skulking into the Burns
camp with a sense of his abasement
upon him can expect no consideration
i-VHii there. He has stamped his word
as worthless, his pledge as of no ef
f><-t. A wretched traitor, unlike Judas
in that he has no thirty pieces of silver
arid that he has not hanged himself,
if- he shall not hereafter be accounted
as one undeserving of trust, and whoso
word is the mockery of truth, then is
there no honor in party affairs. I pre
dict that the career of Wright is at an i
.end. This is the penalty he has earned. |
Probably he relies on a Burns promise, j
but Burns himself, spurned and de
spised, is in better condition to make
ses than to keep them. Good- by
to Wright.
i-ijy also to Huber of Los An
geles. In the face of a solemn agree
ment tn stand by Bulla unless there
should be a caucus decision later to
lii-ke' another course, he cast his vote j
.to-daj f I ( '.rant. That he went to a ;
â¦r<;ppeoLable candidate matters nothing.
for, a man who exhibits such traita is I
rx-.i friend to Grant nor to anybody else.
He is no acquisition to the forces of
'any,, candidate, for he cannot be de
â¢ pÂ£.ided upon. My personal opinion Is
â that H-Ã¼ber will land in the Burns
. camp, md, unless greater inducements
fae/Mtered, stay then; until tents are ;
stiii. k. To lie may be regarded is part |
.of ]_>< fctirs, but It is a poor and .-scurvy i
part which may be left to the Wrights
and the Hubers of the situation. 1 do
r,"t expect to pay either of them, but â 
entertain a hope that in some measure
the estimate in which they are held
w may be a warning to others. As to the
pair, they are gone beyond redemption.
This is not the funeral dirge, but the
epitaj ha.
My letter of yesterday was marked
by an omission. I tried to say that
â¢ Judge l>avis of Amador had made a
ech in nominating Irving M.
Scott, but the superior genius at the
other end of the wire Judged it better to
gay nothing. Judge Davis will please
: gies, for the story he told
of the Oregon was the best the joint
convention has had a chance to listen
â¢to. Also, the type machine slipped a
cog a;,'! thus gave to Grove L. Johnson
r-redit for things I had said myself, a
instance not pleasing to either of
us, Ti>- might have said the same things
b<>' tor. but as he didn't, let the truth
prevail.
It is scandalous that members of the
Supreme Court should be here toutine
for any candidate. It is scandalous be
yond â¢ xpn ssion that the particular
candidate of their affection should be
I'm:. Burns, but if they advocated the
best and purest of men there would
be ' no essential difference in the vil-
Jiiiny.of their mission. They have left
the- bench to which they were elected to
\ out the law of the land and are
Hobbling in politic?. They degrade the
ermine, they prostitute high office and
all to do the bidding of their master.
WHo are their masters? Not the ueo
â¢ple' who chose them, not the Legisla
ture from which they are trying to se
cure more Judges so their burden may
1Â»' lightened, but the Southern Pacific
Jtailroad. To its power they bow. At
it l>.-hest they desert the post of duty
and, mingling with the motley crew,
drink "bad whisky over a bar polished
by the vest of the most notable schla
wags .In California, while they ask
Buppori for Dan Burns. There are
r additions to the push, but the
BupVeme court, as a matter of courtesy.
must tak<- precedence. A push with a
Supreme Court finish is no ordinary af
fair.- Sometimes the lofty tribunal
maKefl mistakes in its regular business.
Its decisions are not always above
criticism, but people choose to think it
fÂ«ir .- 1 1 I<l1 < l able, composed of Jurists of
experience an<l without reproach. Off

Hoary old McFariand, I do not hesi
tate to say, cares more for the Inter

the Interests of California. He has i'ist
been re-elected, and a sorry error the
: ; voters of this State made when they
â  did it. McFariand is h(-rp as a Burns
spieler, ii" better than a Dennerv or a
"banjo-eyed" kid, whose labors h? is
sharing- There are many shady fel
lows <>n the spot fur Burns. It s a
regrettable circumstance that McFar
iand should have taken his stand at
their leveL Affording to Wright there
are four members of this elevated tri
bunal rntrnged in the same business.
It is a pretty rotten business and such
B court needs reforming as badly as
Burns needs defeat.
The joint session to-day was Interest
ing, because there were no speeches and
because the time was given to voting.
There were moments of excitement, as
I when on the first ballot Burns and
A fJ-r.int tied at 26. It was In the pro
duction of this tie that Wright cov
ered . himself with ignominy. I wish
you rouid have observed the cowering,
â¢ u -Â«nkiaK attitude of the man, sinking
into his Beat as though to avoid a
blow. Of course there were cheers, but
they must have struck Wright as
harshest discord. They constituted his
price.
There were two more ballots, the sec-
! ond taken after a spirited effort to ad
journ, and on each Grant led by one
vote, Burns remaining at the first fig
| ure. Huber was the man who flopped,
but it is not a fair assumption that he
can be depended upon. The results do
not indicate much to me except that
Burns is what is commonly designated
as a "dead one." With clear con
science members might turn to Grant or
to almost any other candidate. They
cannot turn to Burns. The condemna
tion of the colonel is too strong, and
for them to share it would mean more
graves by the side of that which
Wright has dug for himself.
I do not by any means regard Grant
as out of the race, but there are many
men who are possibilities. The â¢ real
! temper of the joint session has been but
partly revealed. There are some who
are still voting Into the air. for Tom.
Dick and Harry, and only biding their
time before casting the vote where it
will have some effect. Burns men still
say they can win, knowing they can
not, but some of them merely claim
that Dan will name the man anyhow.
He won't even do this, and when the
break comes they can either go to the
candidates whose chances are best,
thus getting a share of the glory and
spoil, or they can flock sulking by
I themselves.
In all kindness I would call atten
tion to a provoking Instance of habitual
bad manners on the part of Kenne.-ily
of San Francisco. When his turn j
comes to vote .he bawls out the name \
of Burns with every accent and all the (
ardor of a hoodlum. He attracts at
tention to himself, and this is a con
tingency he should avoid. Kennealy ;
Is the individual whom the police of i
San Francisco think had no right to

just In time to constitute an embar- j

STORY OF THE DAY'S
BALLOT FOR SENATOR
Defection of Speaker Wright Did
Not Create the Stampede
Expected.
TALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Cat.. Jan. 12.â The defection of
i Howard Wright, Speaker of the Assem
bly, is the story of the joint Senatorial
; ballot of to-day. The fight itself was
I just as bitter, just as long and just the
: same as yesterday. There were not the
long-winded ppeeches, with their paucity
; of ideas, but there were three ballots and
! a wrangle of small dimensions over the
taking of a 9econd ballot to take their
i place. The interest of the sesion cen
tered In the Speaker from the end of the
first vote when, pale-faced and with
\ bowed head, he forsook Bulla and. In a
voice that could scarce be heard by the
clerk, answered "Burns" to the call of
his name.
What the force that tossed him by the
heels into the corrupt camp of the al
: calde, what the consideration that was
sufficient to drag him from his decency
i and the high esteem that his constituents
I have rushed into print to express, became
! from the moment the question of para
mount interest. But Wright vouch
safed no explanation. Pale and
, worried, with a restless eye wande.r-
I Ing over the chamber for some answering
', gleam of sympathy, he continued at his
dÂ»-sk through the session. His own re
ward was the consternation and pity of
1 those who had looked to him as a leader
! and the claquing and beer-laden cheers
of the hired mob of Burns' adherents
with whom be had chosen to cast his lot.
With Wright Bulla was the only other
' sufferer by thf day's vote. Wright left
j him on the first ballot, and Huber of Los
Angeles followed on the second, though
he cast his lot with Grant rather than
Burns. General Barnes gained a vote in
l&uenter of San Joanuin, who, since the
fight began, has been persistently casting
; his vote, for Van K. Paterson. Muenter
went over to General Barnes on the first
ballot and his arrival WU welcomed with
a hearty round of applause from the gen
â  eral's friends on the floor.
As on yesterday, balloting began shortly
after noon. '1 here was not near the
crowd on hand that was there the day
! before, though the Burns clique was
more than ever in evidence. The gang
had little to cheer at. The last ballot left
them just one vott; behind (3 rant. They
! tallied 26 on the first and 26 it remained
up to adjournment. Grant was even up
; with them on the firm, but pulled up to
' 27 when Huber came over In the second
i and maintained his lead of one to the end.
Neither the gain of Grant nor the gain
of Burns Is significant of further acces-
Blon of strength. The strength of both
â is at its maximum. The Burns people
i figured that the sudden swing of Speaker
! Wright would begin the stampede that
they have bent thHr greatest effort to
ward creating. But it was prolific of
nothing but pity for thoir victim. It was
a sorry, downcast looking lot of heelers
: that trooped out of the Capitol at the end
tif this third day, which was to have been
the day of days for them. Victory, swift
and sure, was promised them; their work
was not to be so hard as profitable, and
with the end of the unsuccessful third
day hard work is staring them In the face,
and with no other prospect than lots of
It. It is not work that they came here
for. There is nothing personal In their
connection with Dan Burns. Friendship
does not enter Into it. It is nothing but
(he hope of quick money that holds them
to him. with possibly a job as Janitor or
with the Fire Department when they get
back to town. With absolute defeat and
the consequent ill temper of their master
as their probable fortune, they are ready
to make use of their return slips which
Herrln was kind enough to attach to his
transportation, and get hack to their old
haunts and old grafts In town.
The first ballot wns takon at 12:30
o'clock and resulted as follows:

Speaker Wright scarce had time to an
nounce the result of the vote when Sena
tor Cutter of Yuba moved that another
ballot be taken. He was opposed by the
Burns faction with a motion to adjourn,
but a rollcall decided In favor of the sec
ond vote and It was at once proceeded

tuted the name of William H. Alford for
that of M. F. Tarpey as their candidate,

The third ballot was also moved by
Cutter and carried. The only change
was In the name of the minority candi
date, Judge Sewell being substituted for
William Alford. Mr. Sewell got the en
tire Democratic vote.
At 1:45 o'clock Speaker Wright an
nounced that three ballots had been taken
and still a United States Senator was not
elected, and an adjournment was taken
until noon to-morrow.
BEECHER AND LAIRD ARE
AGAINST CONSTITUENTS
CALLi HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 12. â Assemblyman J. H.
Beecher of Shasta County, who has permit
ted himself to be mads one of the victims
of the dire Influence of the Burns push
and who has for five ballots voted for
Mexican Dan, feels deeply the unfortu
nate- position In which he Is placed, but
he does not appear to be strong enough
to break away from the fold Into which
he has been dragged and- reassert his
manhood. It was a very cleverly arrang
ed plan on the part of Colonel Burns and
his manipulators whereby they persuaded
Assemblyman Beecher to violate his
pledge made to the Grant people and tq^
cast his vote for a man for United States
Senator whom It Is admitted is not the
choice of twenty-flve Republicans In
Shasta and Modoc counties, which are
included In Beecher's district.
George D. Champlln, a relative of
Beecher, who Is also connected with the
Stanford estate and has been more or less
close In his relations with the Southern
Pacific Railroad. is directly responsible
for Beecher's change of heart from Grant
to Burns. In this work Champlin was
assisted by Superior Judge Edward Swee
ny and ex-County Clerk Drynan of Shas
ta County. Both Sweeny and Drynan
have been in Sacramento on and off ever
since the Senatorial flght opened and
they have left no stone unturned, not only
in bringing Beecher over into the Burns
camp, but they have also been constantly
guarding him to see that he stays where
he is placed.
Beecher was not originally a candidate
for the Republican nomination in the
Fifth Assembly District, but It was given
him. Judge Sweeny, who was originally
favorable to Grant's candidacy, nomina
ted Beecher in the convention. His dis
trict was close, having been formerly rep
resented by Shanahan. so some of Grant*
friends gaVe to Beecher material assist
ance in making his nght. In fact, It was
the friends of Grant who persuaded
Beecher to enter the contest. AH during
The campaign the voters in Shasta ana
Modoc counties believed that Beecher
would, if elected, cast his vote for Grant
fO Ãe!cherÂ°probably intended to do so for
he is not a politician and is not well ac
quainted with the double-cross tactics of
the professional politician. But after he
arrived in Sacramento his relative Cham
nlin got to work on him. and with the
assistance of Sweeny and Drynan, Beech-
Cr J W udge W Â° n S^e m > t0 T"\Â« ambitious
bench of the State would not be distaste
fuf to him, and Colonel Daniel Burns has
in the past promised nominations to
friends who assist him. i Anyway, Judge
Sweeny has closed up the Superior Court
ff Shasta County and made two trips to
Sacramento since the Senatorial fight has
none? and the effect of his labors here
arl visible He has assisted in adding
on! vote to the Burns column, and As
semblyman Beecher has thereby violated
h Th P e judge emphatically denies that he
is for Burns and claims that he has not
participated in the Senatorial fight. But
there are others here who claim that the |
Judge is f mistaken, and they are Just as
firm in their statements that he has
placed the Burns collar over his neck a*
kwoonv is in his denials.
Well defined rumors are current that
Assembly-man Beecher is to be remem
bered by Governor Gage in the shape of
a four-year Job. and it Is also asserted
that ex-County Clerk Drynan is not to
be forgotten for the work that he has
dO A g^n is C n^n d f>overnor Gage a - P
narent in the Senatorial contest.' He is
Cslng It to foist Daniel M. Burns upon
thfÂ« people- of California as their repre
sentative in the Senate of the United
States Evidence of the fact that Burns
can command any of the State patronage
to aid him in his fight daily accumulates.
Of course Beecher and Drynan both deny
that they are looking for any appoint
ment from the Governor. It wag nut a
iTected that they would admit It.
Senator T. J. Laird, who represents the
counUcs of L-assen. Modoc. Shasta Bis
kivou and Trinity, has mlsreprseented his
Constituents" on every ballot by voting for
Turns Laird secured the Republican
nomination in the Second Senatorial Dis
trict after a sharp contest by one vote.
if there had even been a suspicion that
hp would upon his arrival at Sacramento,
become associated with the touts and
Federal brigade in attempting to force
the election of Daniel M. Burns to the
United States Senate, he would have been
buried under an avalanche of votes by
tho hardy mountaineers who make up the
votes of his district and who are unani
mous in their opposition to Burns, and
who regard his Senatorial candidacy as
an insult to the honest people of the
Sl Se t nator Laird has stated that he has no
future political ambition and that this is
the last office he will ever seek at the
hands of the people. It was not necessary
for the Senator to say this He has by
his own acts placed himself on the re
tired list. He has misrepresented his con
stituency by voting for Burns on five
ballots and according to reports from the
counties comprising his district he could
not now be elected poundmaster In any
one of the five counties.
THE BREAK FROM BULLA
WAS UNEXPECTED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 12.â The friends and sup
porters of Senator Bulla do not feel at
all elated to-night over the situation. Not
until this morning did they know that
there would be a break in the eleven votes
which had for two days been cast for the
Senator from Los Angeles. Half an hour
before the Joint session convened Speaker
Wright informed Senator Bulla that he
Intended to change his vote on the first
Joint ballot to Burns. He said that he
had received telegrams from some of hia
constituents asking him to do so, and that
very strong pressure had been brought to
bear upon him which he could not resist.
Senator Bulla informed the Speaker that
he thought he was doing him a great in
justice in leaving his standard, but it had
no weight with Wright.
But while Wright's change to Burns
was looked for, the Bulla men did not
anticipate the change Assemblyman Hu
ber of Los Angeles made from Bulla to
Grant. This was desertion in the ranks
of Bulla's home county, and desertion on
the part of a man who on Monday last
in the Bulla caucus assented to the prop
osition that no man shoufd leave Bulla
save after four of the seven Bulla votes
from Los Angeles had signed a written
agreement to do so.
Huber was seen after the Assembly ad
journed to-day and asked about hia
change of heart. His only reply was that
he "was doing politics." Assemblyman
Valentine asked Huber to attend the Bulla
j caucus, which was held late this affer
noon, and Huber agreed to do so. But
when the caucus was convened Huber was
not there and he failed to turn hln*. .De
spite the two desertions the nine remain
ing Bulla men agreed to stand by thel
candidate in the balloting to-morrow. N
reports of any immediate prospective ac
cessions were made.
The Burns leaders were not at eu
pleased over the fact that" Grant game
one Of Bulla's Los Angeles County vote
to-day. They regarded it as a forerunm
of a complete break-up. Bulla's strenpt
j can never go to Burns, but when the vote
does leave him there are four Grant men
in the Los Angeles County delegation.
Therefore any prospect which tends to in
dicate that Bulla is to retire the Burns
men regard with a feeling far from satis
factory. They want to keep Bulla in the
contest. There was a rumor that Burns
would to-morrow throw to Bulla three or
four votes which have been cast for other
j candidates and which he can control in
| the interest of Bulla but which he cannot
! secure for himself for the reason that the |
i members are afraid to vote for him direct.
If such a move is contemplated by the
Burns people to encourage the Bullaltes .
i and keep the nine votes ne has now to-
I gether, they have not notified Senator j
Bulla to that effect, for he stated posi- ,
tively to-night that unless there was a ;
general break he anticipated no additions !
to his standard to-morrow.
WHY PARDEE AND DALTON
DID NOT GO TO THE BALL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 12.â Dr. George C. Pardee |
of Oakland and Assessor Dalton j
of Alameda County journeyed all â¢,
the way from the bay to Sac- j
ramento In order to shine ac leading i
lights In high social circles at the Inau- ;
gural ball. But both of these distinguish- !
ed gentlemen were doomed to disappoint- |
ment, for neither of them was permitted i
to mingle with the gay and brilliant !
throngs that graced the second floor of !
the Capitol on Monday night.
Dr. Pardee's form had never been dec- j
orated with a dress suit, but It so hap
pened that his friend. Assessor Dalton, j
had two suits of this character, and when
the doctor unbosomed himself and ex- |
plained his dilemma to Dalton he prompt- |
ly proffered the doctor the loan of his
extra dress suit, thereby clearing the way ,
for Oakland's ex-Mayor to appear at the '
one social function in which all the State ,
Is Interested in appropriate attire.
Mr. Dalton's extra suit was not made ,
for Dr. Pardee and it needed fixing In
order to -bring it to the point where it
did justice to the doctor's manly form.
The coat and vest were both all right,
but the trousers were long and the waist
measurement was sufficient to cover the
doctor almost twice. These little defects,
however, were mere trifles and easily
overcome. Several tucks were taken In
the waist and the length of the trousers ,
legs were abbreviated by several inches
Finally after a trusty tailor had labored j
for several hours on the suit the doctor |
donned it and came forth a thing of beau- <
ty Dalton waa proud of him and con
gratulated him on his magnificent ap-
P Speaker Wright had promised the doc
tor and Mr. Dalton that he would furnish
them with two tickets to the ball. Both |
gentlemen, dr.-ssed in their finest linen j
and arrayed in their gaudiest purple, |
took up their station at 8 p. m.. waiting ;
for the Speaker to make good his prom- j
ise to furnish them with the pasteboards
that would give them entree to the ball
room Nine o'clock came and still no
word from Wright and no tickets. The doc-,
tor and Mr. Dalton began to get nervous.'
Could the Speaker have forgotten them? j
Certainly not. He was not a man who
would make a promise to give his two
friends admission to the sacred precincts
of a great society function and then over
look them. The clock ticked off another
hour and still another and still no tickets.
Then it was that Dr. Pardee and Mr.
Dalton realized that they had been
dumped. They were not altogether
pleased at the way they had been over
looked and decided to go into caucus.
Dr. Pardee acted as chairman. Mr. Dal- j
ton moved that It be the sense of the I
caucus that neither of them attend the |
inaugural ball, and the motion prevailed. |
At 11:30 the caucus adjourned without i
date. Dr. Pardee immediately thereafter
shed Mr. Dalton's dress suit, took the â¢
tuck out of the waist of the trousers, re
stored the trousers legs to their original j
length and returned the suit In Its en- !
tirety to Mr. Dalton. Both gentlemen '
tookthe first available train for Oakland, i
They had traveled one hundred and \
eighty miles, adorned themselves regard- :
less of expense and suffered some consid- j
erable discomfort to attend the Inaugu- j
ral ball, and then the privilege had been j
denied them because of the short memory
of their friend.
WRIGHT'S EXPLANATION
MAY CAUSE SCANDAL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- i
MENTO, Jan. 12.â The statement made by
Howard E. Wright to the effect that the !
attitude of four members of the Supreme !
Court influenced him to cast his vote for j
Burns created consternation in the camp j
of Burns. Advisers of the colonel regret j
exceedingly that the Speaker made an |
assertion of this character and are cir- j
culating the report to-night that there is i
no foundation for his statement. All the j
candidates and the friends of the aspi- |
rants for the Senatorshlp were astonish
ed that Wright should give utterance to
such views, even If he had knowledge i
that Supreme Justices were mixing In the
Senatorial fight.
In the minds of many of the people of
! California there has long been a suspi
j cion that the highest judicial tribunal of
the State was not free from the taint of :
corporate influence. The statement of j
i Wright will tend to confirm the sus
i picion in the public mind and arouse the |
people to a sense of a new and great
danger.
The lawyers of the Legislature are talk- !
i ing to-night in whispers about the re- |
markable explanation given by Wright j
for his course in the Senatorial oontest. j
! Something will be sprung at once to |
smooth the matter over in order that the
Supreme Court of the State may not be
exposed to a storm of public indignation.
It is now said by Wright's friends in
the Burns household that he should not
! have made any explanation beyond a ;
! mere declaration that gratitude and i
I recognition of political favors caused him
to espouse the cause of the "colonel."
Wright's statements may be cast aside '
as a sensational incident of the day, but
many lawyers fear that It will cause a ;
tremendous scandal in California.
MCCARTHY TRYING TO
SELL BURNS A GOLD BRICK
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 12.â The Senatorial contest
has brought to Sacramento a number of
characters who are desirous of being
placed In close contact with Colonel Ma
zuma, and many of them are not at all
particular as to how or where they mete
the colonel so long as they succeed In
forming his acquaintance.
From San Diego J. Harvey McCarthy
has Journeyed to Sacramento for the pur
pose of looking upon the Senatorial fight
and gathering such crumbs as may hap
pen to fall from the table and come with
in his reach. McCarthy is somewhat of
a picturesque character. He is a Demo
crat and is the person with whom Govern
or Gage alleges Mr. Grant's San Diego
manager, Charles Hardy, arranged a deal
whereby the Hardy Republicans in San
Diego County were to vote for Maguire
for Governor in consideration of the fact
that such Democrats as McCarthy could
influence were to vote for the Republican
legislative candidates.
When McCarthy was first approached
I by the Grant people he entered a verbal
denial of the charge that there was any
deal of the kind indicated between him
and Hardy. Then later the Grant people
asked him to sign an affidavit to that ef
fect.
But here Harvey balked. He does noth
ing of that character unless he is paid
for it. He refused to sign the affidavit,
and the Grant managers did not think
enough of it to press the matter, bo they
i simply let his affidavit go. For the past
I two days McCarthy has been consulting
with the Burns leaders, and the story
came straight from Burns' headquarters
that McCarthy was endeavoring to sell
i for $500 an affidavit to Colonel Burns,
i which would be to the effect that Hardy
! had made a deal with him last October
to trade off the Republican* State ticket
in San Diego County for Democratic
votes for the Grant legislative ticket. Mc-
Carthy was asked last night whether or
not he had tendered his affidavit to the
Burns leaders for a consideration and he
. denied the charge. However, McCarthy
i has had several conversations with
i friends of the colonel to-day. His affl
i davit in thiÃ matter of the treachery of
j the Grant men is a gilded brick and utter-
Ily without value. If J. Harvey has ten-
I dered it to the colonel and the colonel has
purchased it he has purchased something
that he cannot use for any purpose.
BUSINESS TRANSACTED
IN THE ASSEMBLY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
-1 MENTO, Jan. 12.â The Committee on Con
tested Elections began active work yes
terday morning, when Assemblyman Cos
per of Tulare, chairman of the commit
'â . tee, applied to Speaker pro tern. Anderson,
i who was in the chair, for authority to
I subpena witnesses and exercise other
i quasi judicial prerogatives. The author
i ization was given, and the committee pro
| ceeded to issue subpenas for witnesses In
i the three contests that it has to consider.
Belshaw of Contra Costa raised another ;
storm over the official stenographers. The :
only time they have been in the Assem
bly was during the uncertain days when i
they were rustling for their jobs, and Bel
shaw got up to ask that they be notified
to be on hand each morning at 9 o'clock
or give up their positions. Dibble of San ,
Francisco, chairman of the Committee on j
Rules, said he had submitted a rule coy- j
erlng their case, and asked that no ac- !
tion be taken until his report was ren- i
dered.
The Committee on Federal Relations re- ;
ported for the adoption of Assembly con
current resolution No. 2 relative to the ,
completion of the breakwater at Port San
Luis, and it was adopted by a unanimous
vote.
The Assembly is getting ready to fight
Cutter's bill doing away with the Belshaw
attache law. The Democratic minority
is lined up solidly with Belshaw, and he
has also got the support of a goorl many
of the members who have come pledged to
economy. Belshaw claims that the gen
eral tone of the Assembly is favorable to
his measure, and he predicts that Cutter's
amendment will be killed off when it gets
within reach.
Thirty-one bills were introduced during
the morning, but excepting Caminettl's
school bill none of them were of more
tlinn passing interest. At 11 o'clock re
cess was taken until noon, when the Sena
torial ballot was to come up, and upon the
completion of that at 2 in the afternoon
adjournment was taken until to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock.

him to the high station.
The other night he imparted In confi- I
dence to a friend that he occupied the
same re'ation Â£o Colonel Burns that the
lamented Garfield once occupied to John
Sherman. oarfield went to the national
convention at Chicago in good faith to !
espouse the cause of John Sherman. In
his speech placing Sherman's name be- |
fore the convention he had no omer pur
pose than that of gaining success for the !
candidate. The brilliant speech of the ;
gitted Garfield, however, challenged the :
admiration of the great convention and
the delegates saw in the speaker the man
for the high office of President.
Senator Shortrldge believes that his
own speech placing Colonel Burns In nom
ination impressed the Senators with so
lofty a regard for his qualities as a leader
that they cannot be restrained from com
ing forward and tendering him their sup
port for the office of United States Sen
ator.

MRS. WILSON IS
ARRAIGNED BY
HER DAUGHTER
The Child of Daniel H. Wilson
Demands Vengeance of
the Law.
Mrs. Miller Visits Her Husband and Creates
a Scene in the Office of Sheriff Savage.
Accused Women on the Verge of
Collapse â McEwen's Fear.
SUISUN, Jan. 12.â Interest in the
Wilson murder case continues unabated
and everybody is on the gui vive for
further developments. Contrary to ex
pectations H. E. McEwen, the old
rancher with whom Mrs. Dickinson has
been living, was not arrested to-day,
but he knows he is under suspicion and
lives in dread of being taken into cus
tody. The officers, who have woven the
network of evidence around the alleged
slayers of the old rancher, are being
congratulated on every side.
"You have caught the murderers of
old Dan Wilson this time," is the in
variable greeting. If there is a person
in Suisun or Fairfleld or in the vicinity
of the Wilson ranch who believes a
mistake has been made he is carefully
keeping his opinion to himself.
Mrs. Miller visited the County Jail at
Fairfield this morning and had a brief
interview with her husband. The in
terview was not entirely satisfactory to
either husband or wife as the meeting
took place in the Sheriff's office and
neither Miller nor his wife was al
lowed to discuss the case or anything
relating to it.
Mrs. Miller is rather a handsome
woman, of Spanish blood, about 35
years old. She has piercing black eyes
and a determined manner that seems
to brook no opposition. She came up
from Port Costa on the early train
and swooped down upon the Sheriff's
office like an avenging angel. She de
manded to be allowed to visit Miller
in his cell at once and also
to see her mother-tn-law and sister
in-law. Sheriff Savage was not
inclined to grant her request, as he is
desirous of shutting off every avenue
of communication. When Mm. Miller
was informed that the prisoners could
not be seen her eyes flashed fire. Step
ping close to the Sheriff she cried in a
voice quivering with suppressed ex
citement: "Can't see my husband?
Why can't I see him? He did not kill
Wilson; you killed him!"
The Sheriff was struck speechless by
this unexpected and 1 highly dramatic
accusation. He recovered his powers
of speech and the use of his mental
faculties after a brief period, however,
and tried to pacify his accuser with
soft words and sympathetic assurances.
His efforts were vain, however. Mrs.
Miller declared she had come to see her
husband and she proposed to see him.
After a conference with the District
Attorney the Sheriff finally gave the re
quired permission, but stipulated that
the prisoner should be brought to his
office and that no reference to the
charge against him should be made in
the conversation between him and his
wife. Miller's first question upon en
tering the office was whether his moth
er and sister had been arrested.
"Why, yes. They are locked up
here," said Mrs. Miller.
"HowÂ»do you know?" asked Miller,
quickly.
Mrs. Miller replied that she had read
the news of their arrest in the news
papers. Deputy Sheriff Downing then
interfered and threatened to lock Mil
ler up in his cell again unless he ceased
to talk on the tabooed subject.
Miller gave his wife an order for his
last month's salary, due from the rail
road company, and after a lone talk
on purely personal affairs he was led
back to the jail. Miller remarked that
he needed a shave, and Deputy Sheriff
Reeves volunteered to send him a razor
that he might shave himself.
"Oh, don't do that," said Mrs. Mil
ler hurriedly and in evident apprehen
sion. "He might cut his throat." Mrs.
Miller was not allowed to see either of
the women prisoners and returned to
Port Costa on an afternoon train.
Mrs. Wilson, who has maintained a
sullen demeanor ever since hef* arrest,
is beginning to show the effects of the
strain she has been under for the last
I twenty-four hours. She shed no tear
1 nor gave any outward evidence of eon
< cern w-hen arrested, but late this after
noon she suddenly threw herself upon
[ her cot and burst into tears, bemoaning
her fate and protesting her innocence
of any crime.
"This is awful," she sobbed. "I don't
see why they arrested me. I have not
that date, and now after many years
there are many persons who having such
fac similes are under the impression that
they have a treasure.

PRE-EMPTION AND HOMESTEADâ
Subscriber. City. Tour question as to the

ceased from the 11. of Marcn, 1891.
OLIVER WENDELL lOLM^sâ Z..
City. Oliver Wendell Holmes died In Cos
ton October 7, 1894. The .as. of his pub
lished works was "Over the Teacups."
At the time of his death he was preparing :
an autobiography, which he had for some j
time prior to being summoned dicta- <
tipg to his secretary.
SWANSâ C. F. C, Dlnuba. Cal. The
quotation, "Swans sing before they die;

the readers of this department furnish
the name of the author and where the
poem in which the words occur can be
round?
PICTURES IN COLORSâ An Amateur,
City. This department has repeatedly
announced that It does not advertise the
business of any Individual or firm, and
for that reason this department cannot
toll -who It Is that "offers for sale the ma
terials for taking pictures In their natur
al colors," and for the further reason
that there arÂ« no such materials offered
done anything and I did not expect
this. I wonder if I will ever get out
of this place."
After awhile she became more calm
and stubborn, refusing to talk or to
eat the food brought to her.
Mrs. Dickinson, who has been re
gTaded as the dominating spirit of the
alleged conspiracy, has upset all pre
dictions by giving every evidence of
an early and complete break
down. She passed a sleepless
night, and all day long she
walked the floor of her cell wrining
her hands and crying. Her condition ia
rapidly approaching nervous prostra
tion. Whether innocent or guilty the
woman is in a terrible plight mentally
and physically. She has lost her de
fiant air and now presents such a con
trast to her former self as to create
compassion in the breasts of her ac
cusers. She feels that all the world
is against her.
"Everybody has shunned me and
talked about me," she says, "for the
last two years â ever since the murder.
I know I am hated and have no friends,
but I don't know anything about this
case."
The old woman appears to have even
been deserted by McEwen, whose mis
tress she was. He has made no at
tempt to see her and has made no re
sponse to her written appeal to him to
secure counsel to defend her.
Under Sheriff Robinson drove out to
the McEwen ranch this afternoon and
sought to secure some information from
the old man, but without success. Mc-
Ewen declared, with great vehemence,
that if Mrs. Dickinson was a party to
the murder of Wilson she had not taken
him into her confidence and he had
nothing to tell. The old man sought
to convince the officer that there was
no good reason why he should be taken
to jail. He gave a promise to come to
the Sheriff's office to-morrow morning
to make a statement.
Miller maintains his air of confidence
and expects to prove an alibi with the
testimony of the Sheean girls of Val
lejo, but the Sheriff and those who
have been working on the case are con
fident that the accused man will find
his confidence misplaced. Miller se
cured an attorney to-day to defend
him. The alleged murderer sent for
Attorney Lamont, one of the leading
lawyers of the county, to take his case,
but Lamont refused to have anything
to do with it. During the afternoon
Max Robbins, a young attorney, visit
ed the jail and offered to defend Miller.
The accused prisoners are becoming
confused, and before they are placed
on trial they are likely to be entangled
in contradictory statements regarding
their movements within forty.-eight
hours of the murder. For instance,
when Miller was informed to-day that
the officers had positive evidence that
his mother and McEwen had been seen
leaving his house about 2 o'clock on
the morning of the day on which the
murder was committed, he protested
that they departed a little before mid
night. McEwen thought they had left
Miller's house about 9 or 10 o'clock
Thursday night, and Mrs. Dickinson
said it was as early as 7 p. m. Mrs.
Wilson's memory on this point was
even more defective. She at first said
that McEwen and Mrs. Dickinson had
not visited Vallejo and had not seen
Miller for two weeks before the murder
was committed, but when she was
prompted she admitted that they went
to "Vallejo Thursday mornins and
reached home some time the following
night at what she regarded a reason
able hour.
Mrs. Lillle Baylard, the young mar
ried daughter of Mrs. Wilson, who was
living on the McEwen ranch with her
mother when her father was assassi
nated, maintains that her mother was
outside the house when the fatal shot
was fired, and that she came indoors
immediately after and retired. This is
in direct contradiction of Mrs. Wilson's
statement. Mrs. Baylard says she will
tell everything she knows that can bp
used to help secure proper punishment
for the slayers of her father. She ex
presses no sympathy for her mother
or grandmother and no desire to see
them.
There is but one thing that appears
to worry Miller, and that is the refusal
of the Sheriff to allow him to confer
with his mother. His anxiety to see
her may be natural, but it is also due to
a plainly evident desire to compare
notes, and this is just what Sheriff
Savage is determined to prevent.
unless it is by some bunko firm that pur
ports to do that which has not yet been,
discovered.

In the ordinary way of coun^.ng a man
born on the 18th of December, 1830. was on

would be necessary to know the precise
time of birth in order to answer exactly
how old the man was on the date named.
ONE MILLION STAMPSâ J., City. No
one at this time Is offering any sum of
money for a collection of one million
stamps. Some years ago M. O. Balrd of
Palo, IowaÂ» gave an explanation of the
one million stamp collection in the fol
lowing words: "The collection was made
in full In the city of Cedar Rapids, lowa,
I think during the year 1889. The clrcum*
stances were as follows: An aged lady
wished to enter the Old Ladies' Home in
the city of Cedar Rapids, but in order tÂ»
do so she had to have $100. The editor"
of the Cedar Rapids Gazette, F. W.
Faulks, who is noted for his Interest in
all benevolent works and institutions, con
ceived the thought of raising or securing
1,000.000 stamps, and an enterprising busi
ness man offered $100 for the same. The
Gazette editor used his paper freely for
the enterprise, and invited any one and
every one in the State of lowa to contrib
ute 2-cent stamps to the collection. The
stamps came pouring in by the trou
sands. In an almost incredible space oC
time the number was secured and the old
lady enjoys the fruits of the enterprise.
The stamps were on exhibition in the
show window of the store in the city
named, and I saw them several times."
Since the movement was started in 1889
every now and then there appears a par
agraph to the effect that $100 is offered for
a million stamps, and as often as it aD
pears some one starts in to make a col
lection without the slightest idea if therÂ«
Is any truth In the paragraph printt*.

THE RIVER AT ILOILO HAS
BEEN BLOCKED BY NATIVES
MANILA, Jan. 12.â The situation at
Hollo is unchanged. The Filipinos are
unceasingly active day and night. On
Saturday they loaded some lighters
with rook and sank them at the en
trance of the river, blocking the chan
nel for all vessels with the exception of
launches. The lights have been ex
tinguished. ( >rder, however, is main

On Sunday one of the Arizona's boats,
manned by soldiers, was carried on by
the ebb tide to Quimares Island, and
â while attempting to land there armed
natives assembled on the beach and
compelled the Americans to retire. The ,
Filipinos refuse to have any dealings
with the Americans. Vegetables and
fruit are not obtainable, business is ,
suspended and thy warehouses are
filled with rotting supar.
At Manila the situation is critical, but
pacification is possible in spite of the
unyielding attitude of the Filipinos. It
is reported that the rebel Government
at Malolos is willing that the Ameri- :
c-ins should establish a protectorate on .
the condition that they nromise to give
the Filipinos absolute independence;
within a stated time. It is also said
that the Filipinos will demand official j
recognition.
Efforts are being made to bring about

There were never any honest differ- j

a theoretical difference about the inter

leased upon showing my English

General Aguinaldo's soldiers,
one and all, are longing to attack
Manila. They declare they will

from Iloilo to-day is that the

be bombarded the German Consul went
to Dewey at Cavite and askÂ«d if lie had
iiny objections to this proceeding: To
charter Spanish steamers then lying- in
the Kiver Pasig. placing on board the
neutral refugfes and anchoring theso ves
sels between the neutral warships. Dewey
answered: "Well, why not? 1 do not
make war against women and children."
Even the Spanish non-combatants were
granted this privilege. The only condi
tion made was that those steamers which,
being in a blockaded port, belonged to the
Government of the United States, should
return to Dewey's hands after the sur
render of Manila. Furthermore, ho grant
ed that in the casÂ« of a typhoon all these
steamers of refuge might come over and
anchor with the American fleet at Cavite.
Asked if German military men gener
ally who had seen the run of events
at Manila held the same opinion of
Dewey, the major replied that they
did.
The question was asked: "What are
going to be the future relations of Ger
many and the United States in regard
to possessions in the Eastern archiDel-
ago?"
Major yon Sonnenburg replied: "Ger
man and American interests through
out the whole world run alone parallel
lines, and parallel lines, you know,
never meet. I do not see how any ill
feeling can arise between the two great
peoples."
Questioned about the attitude of the
native Filipinos toward the United
States, Major yon Sonnenburg was em
phatic:
"The Filipinos will fight," he said.
"unless you give them what they want.
I believe they will not lay down their
arms until they get self-govejnment."
STRONG OPPOSITION
TO PEACE TREATY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.â Little busi
ness was transacted by the Senate in
open session to-day. Sixteen bills on
the private pension calendar were pass
ed and a joint resolution extending the
thanks of Congress to Miss Clara Bar
ton and other officials of the Red Cross
Society for their beneficent work in
Armenia and Cuba were adopted.
In the executive session the proposi
tion to debate the Paris treaty in public
was discussed, but no conclusion was
reached.
Senators Hale and Hoar announced
themselves openly during the session
as determined to vote against the
treaty, and while the discussion was In
progress, a number of Democratic Sen
ators held a conference for the pur
pose of deciding upon a course of an
tagonism calculated to secure its de
feat. While confessing that they are
not yet able to count enough Senators
to insure this result, they profess to be
very hopeful as a result of the work so
far done.
IMPERIALISM DECLARED
"CRIMINAL AGGRESSION"
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.â The House
to-day passed the diplomatic and con-
sular appropriation bill without an
amendment. During the general debate
two set speeches were made against
imperialism by Carmack and Games of
Tennessee. The diplomatic and con
sular bill Is the sixth of the regular
appropriation bills to pass the House.
Seven budgets yet remai/i to be acted
upon. The bill, as passed, carries $1.
--705.533.
In his speech, Carmack protested
against launching this Government on
a career of conquest and criminal ag
gression. The President, he declared,
was now waging war upon his own re
sponsibility, for his own purpose. While
the war against Spain had been blessed
of God, this war for the conquest of
the Philippines was a crime against
liberty and the curse of God was upon
it. It revolutionized every tradition of
the republic. It was being entered upon
thoughtlessly and recklessly witho-ut
considering the cost. It was in utter cun
tompt of the solemn warnings of the
greatest and wisest of our statesmen.
The flag was to be kept floating over
the Philippines, but not a single free
man was to stand beneath its folds. A
cuuntry that was not fit for a free
man's home was not fit for a free
man's flag. (Democratic applause.)
He spoke, of the tremendous cost dis
tant possessions would entail upon us,
drawing his illustrations from the
countries of Europe. England, he said,
expended one-third of her revenue fcr
the cost of past wars and one-third In
preparing for future wars. Only one
third was expended to meet the current
necessities of Government. But added
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1899.
American troops have not yet

The natives have poured kero

Thousands of natives are leav

bare of provisions.
The First California Regiment,
which embarked a week ago in
five steamers, presumably for
Iloilo, are at this moment disem
barking. This would indicate
that General Otis has abandoned
his designs upon Iloilo for the
present, or that he requires all
his men to defend Manila.
to the monetary cost, sa!d he, would be
the loss of our sense of security and
peace of mind. "War all around threat
ened us constantly and to meet it we
would have to be armed to the teeth
on sea and land. Once a nation tasted
of colonial empire it became a passion.
The appetite was never satisfied. Yet
one of the world's greatest men had
declared that colonial empire had never
been a source of power to any country.
Macaulay affirmed it. Lord Beacons
field declared that England's colonies
were a millstone around her neck. Ho
referred sarcastically to Secretary
Gage's alleged statement that Christian
civilization and 5 per cent profit could
go hand in hand. He wanted to know
if we could perve God and Mammon
at the same time.
Carmack was liberally applauded and
congratulated by his colleagues when
he concluded.
Games (D.) of Tennessee followed
with an argument against the power
of the United States to acquire terri
tory except for the purpose of making
States of such territory.
FILIPINO REFUGEES
TELL QUEER YARNS
HONGKONG, Jan. 12.â A steamship
Just arrived from Manila brings a large
number of rich and influential Filipinos
and their families, who have left the
Philippines owing to the situation
there. The refugees say the landing of
American troops at Iloilo would be
treated as casus belli, and that the
Filipino army thereupon would attack
General Otis at Manila.
The Filipino Government has offered
an asylum in the province to foreign
families, including Spaniards, who are
now inhabiting Manila.
The Filipinos here say that ten Amer
ican volunteers Jumped overboard from
the transports bound from Manila to
Iloilo, swam ashore and said they had
not volunteered to fight the Filipinos.
The report is not confirmed.

WAS ALBERT
COOK SLAIN IN
SELF-DEFENSE?
NAPA, Jan. 12.â 1f the killing of Al
bert Cook was not the result of an act
of self-defense by Jesse Walters, the
Oakville capitalist, It was one of the
moat cold-blooded, cowardly and delib
erate murders ever perpetrated. And
each day adds strength to the now gen
erally accepted belief that it was the
latter, and each passing hour augments
the bitter sentiment against Walters.
In the general condemnation of the al
leged atrocious crime that is heard on
every side, ex-Sheriff McKenzie cornea
In for not a small share of the blame.
All through Napa County the tragedy,
though it occurred one week ago to
day, is the still absorbing topic, as Wal
ters is and his victim was well known
In this section.
Interest was intensified by the sensa
tional testimony which was forced from
ex-Sheriff McKenzie yesterday by Dis
trict Attorney Bell. This brought Mrs.
Walters, the wife of the prisoner, di
rectly into the affair, and made a dra
matic climax to the many sensational
features that have already developed.
His testimony was that he had been
asked by Mrs. Walters to give employ
ment to a cousin of hers; that he had
employed Cook, who came to him under
the name of Doerman, on the repre
sentation that he was the cousin of
Mrs. Walters. This testimony made a
deep impression on the Coroner's jury,
and speculation was indulged in to-day
by people here whether the finding of
the Coroner's jury would not implicate
ex-Sheriff McKenzie in the alleged mur
der as an accessory before the act, on
the theory that he was a party to a
conspiracy which resulted in the in
veigling of Cook into McKenzie's stable
and his subsequent killing. Should the
Coroner's jury go to this length, the
authorities will cause the arrest of Mc-
Kenzie. This information was vouch
safed the representative of The Call at
the office of the District Attorney.
In the minds of those connected with
the prosecution there is not the slight
est doubt that Cook was foully killed.
This confidence is based partly on the
evidence already given at the Coroner's
inquest and partly on testimony not

the District Attorney. It is claimed
that there â¢will be no difficulty in con

All three, bullets fired by Walters
struck Cook, notwithstanding that Wal
ters, according to his original state
ment, was under fire when he first shot.
Only one of Cook's shots went home,
though he fired four shots, and is said
by Walters to have taken the Initiative.
All the missiles that plowed their way
into Cook's body show a range that
indicated his back was toward Walters
when the latter fired.
The testimony of Fred Jacks was that
the sound of the first two shots was
considerably louder than some of those
which followed. The importance of
IF FRANCE DARED
SHE WOULD FIGHT
AGAINST ENGLAND
BERLIN, Jan. 12.â The opinion Jb prevalent here that the diffi
culties between France and England are by no means over and that
England Is bent on exacting 1 further concessions from the republic.
No one appears to doubt that if France were in the same relatively
strong position that England Is to-day there would be war to-morrow.
As a matter of fact most people believe that the English need a
war, not one of those that are profitable to illustrated journalism,
but a war that would carry off a hundred thousand men and which
in its consequences would lead to the purification from Internal cor
ruption and decay that is undermining England's greatness.
NOISY WELCOME
TO THE RAINFALL
Giant Powder Exploded
at San Miguel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
gAN MIGUEL. Jan. f2.-the rainfall
here yesterday was 1.68 Inches, as against
.07 of an Inch on the same date last year.
The amount of the precipitation for the
Btorm up to Tuesday night was 2.37
inches and for the season 3.66 inches. Last
year up to this date only .84 of an inch
of rain fell at this point. The ground is
thoroughly soaked, and In the low places
â water covers the land. Giant powder was
exploded last night in celebration of the
deliverance from drought. The greatest
change .has taken place between San
Lucas and Bradley. What were dry, sun
baked plains forty-eight hours ago are
now great fields of water, with all of the
water courses overflowing their banks. At
a point a few miles south of San Lucas
the railroad track was partially sub
merged and the foundation of a cattle
guard so hadly washed out that trains
were delayed. The grass has begun to
show, above ground, but it is yet too cold
to make a rapid growth. It is noticeable
that the farmers and business firms in
this vicinity who were preparing to move
Jacks' testimony lies in the fact thttt
Walter's weapon was a i4-calfcer Smith
& W r esson, -tfhile that of Cook s was of
32-caliber and a much smaller revolver
in every particular, iAt the inquest,
which will be resumed to-norrow,
Jacks' testimony will be corroborated
by that of A. H. Daniels, an ex-Tustice
of the Peace. Jacks keeps a bicy.le re
pairing establishment next door U Mc-
Kenzie's suable, and Daniels and Tacks
â were in the shop when the shootinr oc
curred.
In addition to Daniels, there will e s
tify before the Coroner's jury to-n*r
row District Attorney Bell, who is re
ported to have some startling revela
tions to make; Maurice O'Connell, wÂ»
will give important testimony regard,
ing Walters' movements in Napa on tht
morning of and just preceding the time
of the tragedy; Sheriff D. A. Dunlap,
who will testify concerning the weapons
and the incidents immediately following
the killing, and another witness, whose
name has not been disclosed, who will
testify to having seen Walters hanging
about in the neighborhood of McKen
zie's stable and closely observing the
entrance to it before he finally en
tered it.
Since the testimony by him yester
day ex-Sheriff McKenzie - has worn a
more accentuated look of worry, and
the change in his appearance was the
cause of remarks among his friends
and acquaintances. When Interviewed
by The Call representative to-day he
admitted being aware of the public
sentiment and opinion regarding his
connection with the affair, and made
the following statement:
"I had no knowledge that the man
kiWed was Cook until after the terrible
event, when the corpse was recognised
by Mr. Coward as that of Cook. Be
sides, I did not know that Walters was
coming to the stable that day. It would
be unreasonable to suppose, If I were
a party to this matter, that I would
want to be a witness to the crime.
"So far as my wanting to send ev
erybody away from the stable that
morning, there ia nothing in ft at all. It
was merely by chance that there was
none of the employes in the stable at
the time. The prosecution, I know,
are making much of this fact.
"I am innocent of everything and am
perfectly willing to make known all the
information I have. If Mr. Walters
came here because he got wind of Cook
being employed In the stable he has
placed me in a very nasty position and
any friendship I had for him should
cease.
"I want to say, further, that I never
had any communication with Cook,
either by letter, telegram or telephone,
before he came here. I suppose he
came in response to a letter written to
him by Mrs. Walters, telling him I
would give him employment. I did not
know where he was located. In fact,
his employment was a matter of little
or no thought to me. I had ten years'
business as Sheriff to wind up, as I was
about to go out of office, and I had
sickness in my family, bo I had enough
on my mind without thinking of hiring:
stable men."
Among the matters under investiga
tion and which may be expected at the
examination to-morrow Is the wound
of Walters' and the pistol found near
Cook's hand. One of the theories held
by the authorities is that the wound
may have been self-inflicted, and that
the smaller pistol may never have been
used by Cook or been in hie possession.
An effort is being made to trace the
history of the weapon. No one has
thus far been found who ever saw a
pistol in Cook's possession or heard of
his carrying one.

now, as the result of the downpour, pre

Sieclal Dlspntc-h. to The Call.
CARSO:?, Nev., Jan. 12.â At the Silver
party Sta*Â» Central Committee meeting
to-day the following resolution was in
troduced:
Whereas. W. K. Sharon, chairman of th*
Silver party Sate Central Committee now, Is
laboring t . <1.-V:it the expressed will "' thÂ«
Silver party in 'ts platform declaration for the
re-election of William M. Stewart ti> the

Sharon can no longer hold said office; there
fore
Resolved. That Â«aid W. E. Sharon be re
quested to tender at onop his resignation aa
chairman of the Fllver party State Central
Committee.
This was opposed on tho pround that
the gubernatorial contest took precedence
with the committee It was laid on tha
table temporarily and Governor Sadler
was allowed to select a committee, con
sisting of one from each county, to han
ble his fight in the contested election case.
Money was subscribed to furnish the sin
ews of war for the contest.
On a motion to lift the resolution from
the table a hot fight ensued. Sharon wa3
charged by members of the committed
with having violated party pledges. Shar
oi in defense charged Stewart with
ticrhery. The resolution was finally
taken up by a vote of ?. to 0. After a lonff
debate it was decided by a vote of 23 to 19
to adjourn the meeting for one week, and
the secretary was instructed to put In
the call that the object of the adjourned
meeting would be the deposing of Sharon
from the chairmanship. The staving off
of the vote for one week is claimed as a
victory by the Newlands people. Tho
Stewart men, however, claim that they
are willing to give the people of the State
a week's time to discuss the matter and
allow the central committee men to in
struct the proxies. They say they car
ried their point in having the full pur
pose of the meeting published in the call,
and that the vote, 3 to 9, is significant as
expressing the sense of the meeting
They had full power with the proxies in
their hand to administer full punishment
to Sharon had they felt disposed, but
giving their opponents another week was
in the interest of fair play. This is tha
first preliminary skirmish of the battle,
and both sides claim the honors.
The Stewart men were in high feather
to-day over the report that the anti-
Stewart men were getting ready to
run William Sharon in case New
lands cannot get sufficient votes.
They regard It as a sign that tha
Newlands people realize that they cannot
count sufficient noses to win. Newlands
has been in communication with A. C.
Cleveland, who is now sick at the Arling
ton Hotel, threatened with pneumonia.
Overtures were made to Cleveland yester
day, and as an immediate result the word
has gone out from the Newlandfl head
quarters that â¢ Sharon will be thrown into
the breach if necessary. This statement
Was made in the 1 Enterprise,, Xewlands'
organ, this morning, and is regarded as
printed by authority.
fciOST DURING THE STORM.
Iron Mountain Prospector Believed
to Have Perished.
REDDING, Jan. 12.-To the list of the-,
lives lost in the great snowstorm in
Shasta County will doubtless have to be
added the name of Cal Kro,chex, who has -
been missing for four days. He was a
prospector, residing at Iron Mountain. He
left his cabin last Monday for the moun
tains to the north in search of two pack
horses. A search party, consisting of M.
R. Adams, Krocher's partner, and two
hired men. left Redding this morning to
look for the missing- man. Krocher is an
old mountaineer and ordinarily is per
fectly at home in the hills, but owing to
the heavy storm which set in after his de
parture he is supposed to have lost his
way in the deep snow and perished from
exhaustion and exposure.
A young man named Harkness was a
victim of the snowstorm of New Year's
day. He fell exhausted on the Clear Creek
divide. He was rescued, but died soon
afterward. William Goodall of Shasta
sought refuge in a tunnel from the fury
of the storm, was penned in for days, dug
his way out and reached the Camden toll
house more dead than alive. It is be
lieved that other cases, perhaps of death
will come to light with the melting of the
snow and the resumption of communica
tion with the less frequented sections.

Special Dispatch, to The Call.
MEW YORK. Jan. 12. â The Herald's Washington cor
respondent sends the following:
Brigadier General Charles P. Eagan. commissary general of
â¢:ice of the army, will be court-martialed by order of the
President for vituperative language employed by him to-day be
fore the War Investigating Commission in his comments upon
or General Miles and the testimony of that officer respecting
the character of beef furnished the army which invaded Porto
Rico.
The War Commission will find in its report to the Pre-i
--:' officers that the beef furnished the army
of invasion of Porto Rico was "embalmed/ chemically treated
and unfit for use. are untrue, and that the meat supplied was
good.
It is understood that President McKinley is seriously con
sidering the advisability of relieving Major General Miles from
command of the army as a result oi the beef scandal.
These are highly sensational developments to-day in the
meat scandal, which has disrupted the army from its com
mander-in-chief down to the lowest private in the sen-ice.
They are true indications of the state of discipline which prevails
throu;j vi the military branch, and the heroic treatment which
will have to be administered to bring order out of the existing
â¢â¢.on.
General Eagan has declared for some days past that either
he or General Miles would have to be court-martialed, and he
that either he or General Miles should be put
c army, as either he or General Miles was right.
General Eagan's wishes will be gratified. He will be court-
But it will not be on charges based upon the char
acter of the beef supplied to the army. It will be on charges
. out of his vituperation of his superior officer which
may result in dismissal from the service, and, notwithstanding
the unpopularity of Major-General Miles in administration
â -. that officer will not have to lift a hand to secure redress
for the outrageous insults which he was compelled to suffer to
day.
I learned this evening that Secretary Alger. immediately
upon learning of the character of General Eagan's testimony,
verified the reports of the gross language which the commissary
general had employed, and it is expected he will ask the com
n to present him to-morrow with a full copy.
The commission will not hesitate to comply with his re-
Its members were deeply shocked at the vulgarity dis
played by the witness, his utter disregard of the traditions of
the sen-ice, and finally his breach of discipline in criticizing so
disgracefully the conduct of his superior officer.
In the meantime General Miles is sawing wood and saying
little. He appreciates that his position has improved by the
disgraceful attack made upon him by General Eagan. He knows,
though Secretary Alger has not communicated with him. that
the Secretary of War disapproves of General Eagan's language,
and he knows, furthermore, that the President stands with his
Secretary of War. But General Miles' hands are tied.
A personal friend of General Miles, who is aware of the pres
ent intentions of the commandin general, said to me to-night:
"So far as General Eagan and his testimony are concerned
General Miles thinks the commission should have refused to
listen to such language, just as in Congress when one member
calls another a liar the Speaker decides him out of order. The
general does not contemplate taking any immediate action."

given before the War Investigating
'Commission to-day by v Commissary
-'jeneral Eagan. who, appearing unex
pectedly to meet the allegations against
the beef issued in the war, vigorously
arraigned Major General Miles, com
manding the army. He read his testi
mony from a large written statement.
He denied numerous statements of
General Miles, charged that the latter's
testimony constituted severe reflections
â on the commanding generals of the ex
peditions, and referred to him as "this

any other preparation for availing himself
of the funds at his command. There were
experienced disbursing: officers in the isl
and that had in the aggregate over $400 -
000 in their possession", and yet General
Miles had complained that there were
no paymasters in the island, so that the
soldiers had no money with which to buy
food for themselves. General Miles had
then called on the department to put $50 -
000 more In the hands of Black, and this
General Eagan declined to do. putting
J1').OÂ» to Major Black's credit In New
York
General Eagan referred to the mysteri
ous manner in which papers disappeared
from the files of the W ar Department. He
said that while General Miles was at
Tampa he wired to the commissary gen
*ral to know what- stores t and supplies
we . re . on hand at Tampa, and some other
points. General Eagan replied in the
usual way. though at that time the rail
road tracks at Tampa were piled with
millions of rations. General Eagan said
he was astounded the following morning
to see In the reports to certain papers
that General Miles had severely repri
manded the commissary general, the chief
of ordnance and the quartermaster gen
eral for the unprepared condition of their
respective departments. General Miles
had no right in the world to deliver such
%H Ap J 7l and \. an ? wttcess had at once in
closed the clipping to the adjutant gen
eral s office, requesting an inquiry as to
the authenticity of the report. No such
reprimand was ever received by him and
the general commanding had taken no no
tice of his inquiry or even taken the trou
ble since then to declare the unauthorized
character of the present statements. It
was such indifference as this that had
given license to the yellow journalistic
knaves j ho had misrepresented and
hounded Government officials throughout
the war t Gene al Ea*ar. subsequently
had tried to get his letter of inquiry and
press clipping from the adjutant gener
al s office, but it had disappeared and was
nowhere to be found.
Witness then charged General Miles di
rectly with disarranging and hampering
the administration of the War Depart
ment by calling officers from their duty
where their presence was absolutely ne
cessary This was the case in taking
Colonel John \\ eston away from Cuba to
serve with the Porto Rican expedition
and in putting Major A. L. Smith; a very
efficient officer, assigned as depot commis
sary in Porto Rico, to work on "some
transport duty, when his services were
demanded on shore. General Eagan said
the commanding general went clearly
outside his power in doing this, and Inti
mated that General Miles was moved to
do so by the Ignorance and Inefficiency of
his own appointee. Major Black who was
supposed to be the chief commissary of
General Miles' staff. General Eagan re
ferred to General Miles' testimony that he
had telegraphed the department from
Porto Rico for complete and proper ra
tions, and said that If the commissary
general's office had received any such
message he should have considered it at
the request of a "very ignorant and 11
Informed person."
Continuing, General Eagan referred to
General Miles' expressed preference for
native beef, of which he said there was
plenty, and asserted then* were no cattle

Froro Gen. Eagan's
denunciation of Ma
jor General Nelson
A. Miles.
; -would never allow. General Eaeran, quot
i inp General Miles' allegation that In his
judgment there was some serious defect ;
i in the refrigerated an 4 canned beet, said
I General Miles would not say this was :
anything more than his judgment.
"Whoever." said General Eagan, "calls i
It "embalmed beef' is a liar."
Citing the reports submitted by* General
Miles in corroboration of his statements, j
: General Eagan submitted whether or not
j his course of submitting these reports
would not be construed as seeking adverse
! reports. He cited Generals Merritt and
Shafter as approving the beef.
"Newspaper statements emanating from
General Miles that 190.000 pounds of the I
beef were condemned at Porto Rico is ab- I
solutely false. No such quantity was
condemned there or elsewhere." -
Witness said Surgeon Daly's report that
the beef apparently was injected with
chemicals to aid in preservation was "a
' falsehood and he made it out of whole
I cloth." He denounced the assertion that
chemically prepared beef had been issued
anywhere and said he did not believe ;
Surgeon Daly had that belief then, since
or now.
"Why." he asked, "did he shirk his
i duty; why not then make chemical
; analysis and why keep this information
j to himself and spring it suddenly on the
: commission and the whole country and
imply packing houses have been cheating
the Government and violating their con- :
tracts. At no time did he inform the
, commissary- general or the Secretary of
War of these things."
"This," continued the witness, '"is a
scandal calculated to ruin thousands of
people and discredit and put in infamy
one of the greatest industries of the
world. General Miles, in his testimony.
refers to the beef as sent out under pre
tense of an experiment. This implies cor
â â  ruption, a serious charge not to be lightly
made. Already t c press almost wholly
has accepted this view, and some nave
demanded my dismissal. It was not an
experiment nor pretense thereof.
"General Miles lies in his throat, In his
; heart, in every part of his body. He
\ should be drummed out of the service
: and imprisoned. I wish to force the lie
; back in his face. Unless he can prove his
statements he should be avoided by
â â  everybody, should be barred out of every
i club."
The witness denounced in the most sen
â¢ sational terms his (Miles') scandalous,
llbelous and malicious falsehoods.
General Eagan's testimony on this
point was:
"General Miles was asked by your com
mission how tinned fresh beef became a
part of the army ration. His answer is.
j 'You had better ask the Secretary of War
! or the Commissary General. I think they
: can tell you. I know it was sent to the
army as food and the pretense Is that it
was sent as an experiment."
"General Miles, in saying that this
\ food was sent to the army as 'a pre
tense for an experiment,' says that
; which implies corruption, which ninety
nine out of every hundred people will
understand to mean corruption, be
j cause it was a "pretense of experiment."
he says, not even giving credit to me
j for furnishing it as an experiment, but
j that I furnished it under the 'pretense
of an experiment.' This is a serious
charge, and should not be made by any
man lightly nor without ample evidence
to support it. Taking the statement in
the sense it was probably intended, the
sense that will be accepted by the coun
try at large, the sense that already the
j press, almost wholly, of the United
I States has accepted it â indeed some of
| the press called for my dismissal from
i the army and my court-martial â I
1 answer that it was not furnished
J under the pretense of experiment, nor
' even as an experiment, and when Gen
eral Miles charges that it was furnished
as a 'pretense of an experiment' he lies
in his throat, he lies in his heart, he lies
in every hair of his head and every pore
of his body, he lies wilfully, deliber
ately, intentionally and maliciously.
"If his statement is true that this was
furnished under "pretense of an experi
ment' then I should be drummed out of
the army and incarcerated in prison
with other libelers. His* statement is
a scandalous libel, reflecting upon the
: honor of every officer in the department
! who has contracted for or purchased
this meat, and especially and particu
larly on the commissary generalâmy
self. In denouncing General Miles as a
liar when he makes this statement I
wish to make it as emphatic and as
coarse as the statement itself. I wish
to force the lie back into his throat
covered with the contents of a camp
f latrine. I wish to brand it as a false
j hood of whole cloth, without a particle
of truth to sustain it, and unless he
can prove his statement he should be
driven out of the clubs, barred from the
! society of decent people and so ostra
cized that the street bootblack would
not condescend to speak to him, for
he has fouled his own nest, he has as
persed the honor of a brother officer
â  without a particle of evidence or fact
to sustain in any degree his scandalous,
libelous. malicious falsehoods, viz.,
that this beef or anything whatever
was furnished the army under "pre
tense of experiment.'
General Eagan referred to the pub
i lished interviews of General Miles and
. correspondence between them as to their
â¢ authenticity. General Miles having made
a non-committal reply, and the â  witness
then said: ," ;' >
"When a man refuses to deny a libel or
falsehood or a statement attributed to
him It is well known that he assumes the
matter. When he avoids the question the
: supposition is that he cannot deny it.
My question is not answered yet. He has
i not yet denied the interview published in
I the New York . Journal dated December
; 23. 1598. and having refused to distinctly
deny it. he should be held to the strictest
; accountability for it. If he made these
statements as set forth there, then he
lied again, and if he made the statements
that 'pretense is the . precise . term to be
used' (as he said then, referring to the
, â¢experiment'), then he lied with as black
a heart as the man who blew up the
Maine, and he deserves to be character
ized and known to America and Europe,
Jjar here his - statements - have good, as be
ing the colossal, prodigious liar of the
nineteenth century.
I submit to this committee and to the ;
whole country that this account of an in
terview with him In the New York Jour- :
nal, going uncontradicted. undented, and
when the opportunity was given him a
refusal to deny it in terms, places upon ;
him the responsibility for the statements
in that interview, which statements I !
here and now denounce as unmitigated
falsehoods, vile and slanderous, so slan- ;
derous that it can only be called filth. !
I submit to this commission and to the
country at large whether it is the char
acteristic of an honorable man to permit
such statements as are made in this al
leged interview with General Miles In the [
New York Journal, dated December 23.
ISS3, to go uncontradicted. If untrue, and
whether or not it is not the first duty â¢
of a gentleman, an honest man. an hon- i
orable man, to deny such falsehoods as |
are to be found in the article I refer to,
if they were not made by him."
This interview was headed as follows:
"Miles makes grave charges against the
administration; poisons used in beef made :
soldiers ill; tons of bad beef sent to ;
troops in Porto Rico."
Continuing, General Eagan said: "When :
I was commissary in May last General
Miles had already selected for his staff
as chief commissary one of the ablest
commissaries of the regular army. Major
H. B. Osgood. Judge of my surprise when
one day General Gilmore, the adjutant
general for General Miles, told me it was
General Miles' wfsh to have Major John â 
D. Black, recently appointed from civil
life as a volunteer commissary, made his i '
commissary on his staff. I expressed my I
surprise that the senior officer of the
army should select a volunteer totally
devoid of experience to the subsistence
department and therefore wholly incom- !
petent for such an important duty. Short- i
ly after and about June 18, General Miles !
sent a very ordinary, commonplace tele- i
gram to the adjutant general at Wash- t
ington inquiring what subsistence stores i
the subsistence department had at Tar- â 
pa and somewhere else, some such simi
lar inquiry to the quartermaster general |
and the chief of ordnance.
"I made a formal written reply to this
and to my amazement the next morning I
saw it published in the press of the coun
try that General jdiles had sent or had
. found it necessary to send a serious repri
mand to the quartermaster general, the
; commissary general and the chief of ord
( nance for conditions that he found there. |
No such reprimand was ever received, I
and General Miles has no authority In his |
commission or his position under the law
or regulations to send reprimands to me.
This uncontradicted story of a reprimand
to the heads of three of the most import- j
ant departments of the army aided as j
much as anything in exciting the yellow j
Journal press, the knaves of so-ca*ied j
journalism, to harass and vilify and libel j
the conscientious, able and hard-working
officers or. duty in Washington. Since !
asking that an investigation be made to [
learn who gave out this garbled and al- [
ieged reprimand, I have instituted in- j
quiries to find my requests, with the j
newspaper clippings inclosed. The ad- j
jutant general's department has reported ;
\ their inability to find it."
"Inspector General Breckinridge," he j
said, "has recently addressed letters di- ;
rect to officers of my department calling j
for reports to him about the various artir
cles of food furnished during the past i
year to the army. He does this without
the authority of the Secretary of War.
In effect i - have in these two officers of
the army General Miles and General
Breckinridge who take upon themselves j
to Investigate matters pertaining solely !
and exclusively to the Secretary of War; I
i to call for ex parte reports, and to do [
this directly, not through the adjutant :
general of the army, but direct and with
out the knowledge of the Secretary of
War or the adjutant eeneral of the army.
General Eagan said it appeared from
the seeking of these reports that the sub
ordinates were Inspecting their superior,
| trying him by ex-parte reports obtained !
I at their own instance. He referred to the â 
j reports from officers and submitted by [
j General Miles as irresponsible statements, ;
i and said that few army officers "would :
! take advantage of the situation to make i
I statements which they knew there was [
[no power nor means to disprove, [
' because the substances they speak \
of have passed out of existence, the i
proofs are gone. One of these officers |
goes outside to tell you about competi
tion for contracts and what was used in 'â 
canning, both things without his possible
knowledge. If General -mies had inform
ed himself as much about the army ra- ,
tion as he pretends to have informed him
self about refrigerated beef, which he
falsely calls 'embalmed beef." then he
: should have been enabled to inform you
that this very tinned beef we are speak- \
ing of has been a part of the army ration ;
| since February 8, '>>*. Whether General f
Miles is ignorant of this I do not pretend â 
j to say, but he takes It upon himself when
i asked who fixed it as a part of the array
ration to say. 'You will have to ask some
one here in Washington.' This implica
tion shows how reliable his statements -
â¢ are."
Having traversed General Miles' state- .
ments, he said:
"Having shown him to you as having
i been a liar, having demonstrated the ani-
I mus which pervades this whole matter. I
i go back to his statement that in his judg
i ment food was one of the serious causes
lof so much sickness and distress of the
I troops. The design to say. to imply, to
assert, to insinuate, that sickness * was I
caused from such reason- in Porto Rico I
is to make an assertion wholly untrue, de- '
void of any facts and devoid of truth,
and can only be prompted by a base mo
tive and under cover of the qualification
'in my judgment.' "
Questioning General Miles' course in
submitting briefs of reports from regimen
tal commanders. General Eagan said the
course is unprecedented in the history of '
the army, not within his province, nor
contemplated by law or regulation, and
there would be just as much justice In
the President or Secretary of war send- â 
ing out a circular letter inviting criti
cisms on the conduct of General Miles
| during this war.
His own (Eagan's) conduct and work :
had been looked into; he saw no reason j
why General Miles' conduct and work '
should not be looked into on this show- j
ing, adding: "It is high time and proper
that this commission should examine into
the truth and falsehood of the statements
and examine into his conduct of the war "
He charged that if Chief Surgeon Daly i
with General Miles, had ever made an
expert examination of the beef, then he '
"willfully and deliberately falsified the
facts."
General Eagan concluded as follows
"If I have used harsh language before 1
this commission in dealing with the sub
ject I ask the commission to bear in mind
the grouping together the statements
i made by General Miles means that I ;
have furnished or allowed to be furnished
to the army embalmed beef and that a
great deal of sickness aros^from Its use
that I have furnished meats to the army
under the 'pretense of experiment' meats
that made the soldiers sick.
"Nearly all the press of America, be
cause of General Miles' high position in
the army, has accepted these views and i
his statements, and many of them have !
called for my disgrace, court-martial and I
dismissal from the sen-ice. Although that :
these statements of General Miles were !
held back by him. not furnished to the i
Government for its appropriate action and '
I use. but sprung upon you and the coun- I
try at a time when the country, from the i
falsehoods that had been told in regard i
i to starvation and supplies for the army !
t was in a state of excitement and ready to I
\ believe almost anything. The subject I i
I have, just treated here is a filthy subject
and you cannot touch pitch without be
ing defiled: you cannot touch ba*e ma
licious. Ãbelous falsehoods, misrepresen
tations, without calling a spade a spade
and telling the whole truth and charac
terizing things as they are. The dam-ieÂ» !
that has been done by these statements
is believed to be very great, but I Induie*
the hope and the belief that my state
ment, when published to the country
when read by the representatives of tor- !
eign governments here, will offset the
statements made by General Miles and
will, in some measure at least, do justice
to others that have been wronged ma
ligned and libeled. For myself. I content j
myself with expressing my profound belief
that either General Miles or I should be >
put out of the service; either he la rlsrh* '
or I am rieht: either he dishonors his
uniform with false statements and libels
or I dishonor mine in . feeding soldiers '
with poisonous beef, causing their sick- â 
ness and. doing so under 'pretense of ex- i
! periment." "

AMONG DEPUTIES
Renewed Uproar Over
the Dreyfus Case.

ATTEMPTED INTERPELLATION
UPON THEM DETEATED.
Â«
Statesmen Declare It Is Impossible
to Continue the Revision Pro
ceedings Under Present
Conditions.
Social Dlstatch to ThÂ« Call.
PARIS, Jan. 12.â The Chamber of
Deputies, after an exceedingly stormy
debate on the interpellations relative to
the charges of M. de Beaurepaire.
adopted the order of the day, which
-.va s accepted by the Government, the
vote standing 423 to 124.
The chamber waa crowded. Paul dcs
Chanel, in taking the chair, said that
France loved both the army and justice.
He dwelt upun the danger of internal
dissensions, appealing to deputies to be
calm -- . . lerate.
Then, on the motion of IL. Dupuy, the
chamber proceeded to discuss immedi
ately tae interpellation of Lucien Mil
levoye, Republican-Nationalist, respect
ing M. de Beaurepaire's accusations
against the Court of Cassation.
ii. .Millevoye, amid a constantly
growing tumult, spoke upon the sen
sation caused by these accusations and
declared it impossible to continue the
revision proceedings under present
conditions. He read M. de Beaure
paire's statements and demanded the
adoption of disciplinary measures
against the guilty judges, asserting
that It was for the Chamber and the
Government to take steps to allay pub
lic excitement.
Joseph Lasces, plebiscitaire anti-
Semite deputy for Condon, in the de- j
partment of Gers, evoked considerable
applause by asserting that the country
had enough of the Dreyfus affair, but
the tumult was speedily renewed when |
he began a violent attack upon AL
Luew, president of the criminal branch
of the Court of Cassation; M. Manau.
the procurator general, and M. Bard. |
official reporter to the court, upon the I
original appeal of Mme. Dreyfus for re
vision. "Their actions," he said, "call
for the closest scrutiny."
M. Dupuy rose to protest against the
attacks erf M. Lasces upon the judi
ciary.
The President of the Chamber. M.
Deschanel called M. Lasces to order,
but the Deputy continued long enough.
amid a deafening uproar, to make a
definite charge against the criminal
branch of the court of displaying par
tiality and to declare that the Dreyfus
agitation was being supported by for
eign gold.
1L Lebret, Minister of Justice, reply
ing from the tribune, said that un
doubtedly a fresh incident had arisen
in connection with the affair, but. if as
a citizen and Deputy he cherished oDin
ions to which he was faithful, as Min
later of Justice, he had certain duties
to perform and in performing them he
would not falter. His first duty, he
went on to say. was to assure the rez- ,
ular course of law. As certain charges
had been brought against a Judee he
made them the subject of special, j
searching and sincere inquiries. M. '
Lebret then recounted the details of
the Bard-Picquart incident already
cabled. With reference to Bards
addressing Picquart as "colonel." the ,
Minister of Justice said that the een- j
erals themselves continue to call him
'colonel." and Captain Erque. Pic
quart's jailer, had been ordered to do
so.
This statement was followed by a
great uproar. M. Lasces moved a sus
pension of the session in order to ;.llow
the Minister for War, M. de Freycinet,
to be summoned.
M. Leon de Baudrey d'Asson. Con
servative Deputy for Sables d'OHnde,
moved that the whole Court of Cassa
tion should be court-martialed. The
closure was then declared and various
orders of th" day were proposed, the
Premier accepting the proposal of the
leftists advocating the order of the day
pure and simple. â¢
Finally the order of the day was
adopted. 423 to 124. and the Chamber
adjourned.

Will Submit a Memorandum for Ap
proval to the Diplomatic Corps
at St. Peters
burg.
= --â¢â¢ at Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1539. by Jsmei Gor
don Bennett.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 12.â Much
irritation has been caused in the high
est political and diplomatic circles by
the way the prospects of the so-cailed
â "disarmament" project of the Emperor
have been damaged by misrepresenta
tion.
In the first place the Emperor has
proposed no disarmament, wn&t he
seeks is to stop the continually Increas
ing armaments.
The matter has been very clearly
placed before me by one who knows
the situation exactly and the views of
his Majesty. He says what the Em
peror wishes is to put a stop, if possi
ble, to the prodigal expenditure which
so often occurs when, for instance,
some new gun is discovered, one army
adopts it at a vast cost and all the
rest have to follow suit.
I am confidently told the Emoeror
holds no illusions concerning wh
proposed. At the present moment the
Ministers of State are drawing: ud a
memorandum upon the euoject to be
submitted to the Emperor. This will
probably be revised and certain delays
will take olace before they are ap
proved. Then they will be deliberated
upon by the members of the diplomatic
corps here. Should they arrive at a
practical resolution special commis- ,
sioners from the various nation.?
assemble here to agree upon some joint
action which might seem possible.
. It is necessary to state that while the
heads of the diplomatic corps all are
warm advocates of the Czar"s proposal,
there are indications of sketicism as to :
whether practical resolutions will be
possible.
It is stated that "W. T. Stead, by his
recent trip, has worked up a deal of
friction. First. Baron Fredericks, head
of the imperial household, complains
that Mr. Stead, after he was ree
by the Czar in his private capacity, not .
j=ionally as a journalist, went
home and wrote out the audiences as
an interview. Next comes Mr. Steads
fierce attack upon Count Muravieff. â 
m he treats as a mere fleurehead :
and gives all the credit to Count Lams
dorff. This has not made matters ;
pleasant at the Foreign Office ' here.
Count Muravieff has always set his
face steadfastly against receivine cor- .
respondents, and in this point he dif- ,
fers from Count Lobanoff Roetovskv.
who cleverly made much use of the
press.
YOUNG VANDEhBILT TO
TRAVEL IN EUROPE
Will Then Settle Down to Learn the
Intricacies of the Railroad
Business.
N'EV." YORK. Jan. 12.â A Boston
special to the Herald says: "William
K. Vanderbilt Jr. in his rooms to-day
had this to say of his plans:
1 When I finish college this June I
shall spend some time in traveling. I
consider that as advantageous as col
lege education. Later I shall return
and go into the railroad business, but
I shall no- take charge of it. I know
nothing about railroading and must
learn tbe whole thing before I can con
] trol any part. I shall work in all de
partments in order to have a thorough
â  understanding of it. Then I shall be in
a place to do whatever is needed for
me to do."
Mr. Vanderbilt declined to speak of
his engagement. It is evident that this
has nothing to do with his leaving
| Harvard, as he told his friends a year
I ago he would spend at most only t^o
years at college.
MAYOR EATON NOT
SEEKING NOTORIETY
L.OS ANGELES. Jan. 12.â Mayor
Fred Eaton to-day further defined his
attitude in his proposed crusade against
the saloons. The announcement that if
he finds the Police Commission has the
power to regulate the side door policy
now in vogue he will call upon it to en
force the city ordinances has created
much excitement among those who are
engaged in the liquor traffic.
"It is not fair to call me a Doctor
Farkhurst," said the Mayor this even
ing, "for I am not seeking notoriety;
neither is this an outburst of sensation
alism. I sha!! proceed strictly under
the law. The proprietors of objection
able place? must remove bad features
when notified. Should they refuse to
comply with r he ordinances it will b*
time to try other measures."

he says he has the beet of reason? for
thinking police surveillance Is desirable

ABDULLAH PASHA'S
FORCE ADVANCES
LONDON. Jan. 13.â Special dispatches

vance -was ordered. Abdullah Pasha, com
manding the Turkish troops, was directed
to capture Sasbeh. the headquarters of
an important insurgent leader, 150 miles

A SURPRISING ADDITION.
WHEN the names of the men who voted for
Burns were published yesterday it was thought
the black list was complete. That another
should follow the example of Jilson was hardly con
ceivable, yet one more has yielded and must be placed
on the roll of dishonor. This one. and the fact is
stated with regret, is Speaker Howard E. Wright of
the Assembly. Of him better had been expected. He
has wounded and disappointed his friends, and in so
doing has accomplished nothing more. Seeking to
â¢ aid and abet the enemy, he was able to carry only his
individual strength, and not to do the evil of placing
Burns appreciably nearer the goal. Here is the list
revised :
SENATORS.
Bettman, San Francisco.
Burnett, San Francisco.
Hoey, San Francisco.
Laird, Shasta.
Leavitt, Alameda.
Shortridge, Santa Clara.
Wolfe, San Francisco.
ASSEMBLYMEN.
Arnerich, Santa Clara.
Barry, San Francisco.
Beecher, Shasta.
Cobb, San Francisco.
Devoto, San Francisco.
Dibble, San Francisco.
Henry, San Francisco.
Jiison, Siskiyou.
Johnson, Sacramento.
Keiley, Alameda.
Kelsey, Santa Clara.
Kennealiy, San Francisco.
Lundquist, San Francisco.
McKeen, Alameda.
Miller, San Francisco.
Pierce, Yolo.
Rickard, San Francisco.
Eugene Sullivan, San Francisco.
WRIGHT, Alameda.
Since decent Republicans have thus been twice be
trayed, there is no telling but there are more Judas
like characters still to be revealed. Jilson was the
first. Wright the second. We quote from the cdi-
toria) of yesterday the finaf word "next."
THE PACIFIC EXPOSITION.
rROM the tenor of the proceedings of the con
ference between the Board of Supervisors and
the Pacific Exposition committee appointed by
Mayor Phelan, good auguries can be drawn of the
success of the proposed enterprise. The project was
discussed only in a general way, but enough was done
to show that the Supervisors are willing to co-operate
in any well devised plan for carrying out the under
taking, and that the committee can be relied upon to
suggest such plans.
The proposal submitted at the meeting was that the
Supervisors should ask the Legislature for power to
appropriate Si ,000.000 for the exposition, that $250,000
should be asked as a special State appropriation, and
that Congress should be asked for $500,000. These
sums are not excessive. The city and the State can well
afford the amounts asked for such a purpose as a
great exposition conducted on a scale of the first mag
nitude, and Congress has in the past made so many
liberal grants to expositions in other States it can
hardly refuse the amount it is proposed to ask for
California.
It is stated to be the intention of the committee ap
pointed by the Mayor to request the various commer
cial, industrial and financial organizations to elect rep
.:!â ( se.ntatives to serve with the committee, and in that
v increase the membership from the original fifteen
appointed by the Mayor to 150. Mo better plan could
be dievised for augmenting the strength of the com-
Nnittee and widening its influence. With the enlarged
â  'membership the committee would be fully represen
tative of the business interests and energies of our
people, and therefore well qualified to conduct with
success all the complex work the great enterprise will
. rcqttire.
â¢â¢.The exposition is in many respects the most im
rtant undertaking that now occupies the attention
. of the progressive men of the city. When well under
.'.way and a comprehensive statement of plans can be
â¢ published it will be found to be a movement of inter
. estto the whole United States, for it will not only ex
hibit the industrial achievements and resources of the
'â .-.. region known as the Greater West, but the possibili
ties of commerce with all countries bordering on the
- ' Pacific Ocean and the fruitful islands that dot its wide
expanse. %
.â¢' , When once fairly started the movement will go for
â "â  ward largely of its own momentum, and the enter
_. .prise will increase in magnitude and importance as it
.. nioves. The main thing is to make the start this win
i.'.ter so as to allow an ample period for preparation.
â The time is none too long for the accomplishment of
â  such an undertaking, and it is gratifying to note that
â¢"it is being pushed with vigor and finding favor
â¢ throughout the Stnte.
It would appear from a casual glance at the mes-
sages of the various Governors that most of them
think they were elected not mere State executives,
â¢but to bear the burdens of the earth, while Pingree
. takes in the suni moon and stars as welL
WRIGHT YIELDS \r]lS HONOR.
SPEAKER HOWARD E. WRIGHT has
gone over to Burns. He has yielded his
honor and his manhood, has brazenly be
trayed the trust of his constituents and be
come part and parcel of the unclean gang
trailing, purchased and branded, at the heels of the
Mexican. There is not another man in the Assembly
who could have had less excuse for such a course as
that taken by Wright. He knew that the people who
sent him there did not want him to support Burns.
They had so declared. Representative voters, including
ministers, bankers, merchants, members of the pro
fessions, had made known that they would regard the
election of Burns as a calamity and disgrace. Yet
Wright listened to the tempter, ignored the counsel
of friends to whom he was under obligations and
stamped himself an ingrate and a political pervert.
Such avenues to reputation as were open to him he
has deliberately closed. Such admirers as he had he
has insulted grossly. Such hope as held out promise
to him he has dashed to earth. He has sacrificed
reputation, humiliated all who had confidence in him,
violated promises and acquired an obloquy which will
last until he shall drop from the public life for which
he has shown himself to be unworthy and unfit.
Wright has issued an "explanation" which but makes
his weakness and treachery more apparent. By
coupling himself with other of the Burns tools he
thinks to avert the storm of indignation, but his rea
soning is as bad as his act. He cannot hide under
the bedraggled ermine of the Supreme Court, even if
members of that body have left the duties for which
they are paid to slosh and swagger, inglorious and be
smirched, through the pool of politics made more
foul by the presence of Burns and his creatures.
When a member of the Supreme Court is elected, as
was McFarland, as a railroad man, and visits the
capital to urge the support of Burns, the fact is evi
dent anew that this corporation regards the Mexican
as its property even as, with the best of grounds, it
reckons McFarland with its other assets. Instead of
clearing his own skirts, Wright has directed attention
to the iniquity of those among whom, with a fatuity
akin to madness, he has cast his lot. Yet Wright is
not so dead to the impulses of remorse as not to un
derstand that he has taken a plunge into a deep of dis
grace out of which he can never ascend. The mire
of the pit is on him, and is indelible. His conscience
must torture him, for when he called the name
' D. M. Burns" he hung his head with all the abject
ness of a cornered thief, and blushed the scarlet hue
of shame. His voice trembled, his hand shook, and
well may they have done so. That instant he was
leaving his high estate, that instant he was taking his
place in a rabble of outcasts, whose methods are
criminal, whose object is gain, and whom respecta
bility loathes as a virulent form of evil.
To record the truth concerning Wright is a painful
duty, but as he shall reflect on the ruin he has wrought
he will have to acknowledge that he alone is to blame.
There can be no shifting of responsibility nor evading
of penalty.
A BOARD OF THIEVES.
AN esteemed evening contemporary, speaking of
the late Board of Education and its achieve
ments, refers to it as a "board of thieves." It
declares that no other combination of English words
will adequately describe that choice aggregation of
political rascals. It cites some of the acts of the mem
bers to prove that they rose higher in the scale of
infamy than any other set of men who, in the his
tory of San Francisco, ever attempted to govern the
schools.
It may seem a little harsh to indorse this designa
tion, yet it cannot be denied that, while these School
Directors did not actually steal and thus lay them
selves liable to the statutes against petty and grand
larceny, they nevertheless were thieves, compared
with whom Jack Shepard and Dick Turpin were gen
tlemen.
The late Board of Education did not pick the
pockets of the rich, nor fleece corporations, nor stand
up taxpayers, nor rob the mercantile community.
What they did was to steal money designed to pro
vide the children of the city with the means of ob
taining an education. In other words, they stole
from the young and helpless â a class who were not
able to resent their infamous conduct or set on foot :
measures for their punishment. On the whole, we
think history will justly describe the late Board of
Education as a "board of thieves."
We imagine that the future searcher of public
records, who, perhaps, a century hence, may sit down
to compose a municipal history of San Francisco,
will marvel greatly at one thing. When he comes to ;
study the record left behind by this "board of thieves" ,
he will wonder why no measures were taken for
their punishment. If he delves deep enough into
the subject he may indite some scathing sentences
upon pusillanimous grand juries, indifferent and neg
lectful District Attorneys, busy and complacent
courts and a lethargic and longsuffering people.
But in any event the late Board of Education will
go thundering down the ages as the most infamous j
aggregation of political rascals who ever disgraced a
civilized community. No apology will ever be made
for them. It will be impossible to apologize for men
who robbed the children of a great city and who re
tired from office with the curses of mothers upon
their heads and the maledictions of an entire press
covering them with obloquy.
We had imagined that the "tough old board" of
1881 would never have a counterpart in our history.
The "board of thieves," however, has by contrast
given them a heavenly projection.
AN INCIDENT IN SCOTLAND.
A REPORT comes to us from London to the
effect that Mr. Dunbar, Assistant Under Secre
tary for Scotland, has recently had trouble with
a gas company over the amount of his gas bill, and
has not only surmounted the trouble by defeating the
company, but has disclosed certain reprehensible
practices on the part of gas meters in Scotland which
are of interest to gas consumers in all parts of the
world.
According to the story as it comes to us, Mr. Dun
bar's gas meter showed that within six months he had
consumed 80.200 feet of gas. He protested and of
fered to compromise, but the company stood firm by
the meter, and when he persisted in his refusal to pay
i on that basis the company shut off his gas and sued
him for the amount. When the case came up for
hearing the official meter inspector of Edinburgh was
appointed as an expert to examine the Dunbar meter
and report on it.
The inspector solved the mystery. It is reported
that he found the meter had what he called a "re
verse action." Instead of registering 10,000 feet it
would register 90,000, and Â«o on, until it became a
jumble, of which one could make neither head nor
tail. In Mr. Dunbar's case he figured that there had
been an overcharge of 71.400 feet. This left Mr. Dun
bar liable for 13,800 feet, although he had offered to
pay for 21,000 feet when the bill was first presented
t'- him.
When the report of the inspector was filed in court
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1899.
the gas company not only abandoned the suit and re
placed Mr. Dunbar's gas meter with a better one, but
they paid his legal expenses, and doubtless showed
other evidences of a sincere desire to have the trouble
forgotten. Unfortunately for the company, however,
the matter is not of a kind to be forgotten. The dis
covery that a gas meter may have a "reverse action"
which enables it to pass from 10,000 feet to 90,000
feet at one jump makes the case one of international
interest. It will be read here with as much attention
as in Scotland itself.
It is not likely that any meter in San Francisco is so
nimble as to register 80,200 feet of gas when only
ij,,800 feet had been consumed â it is only a canny
Scot's meter can do that â but all the same there
are reasons for believing some of the meters in the
city have a capacity for the reverse action in a
restrained way.
Companies whose officials persist in extorting $5
deposits from their patrons are not likely to have
"been neglectful of the advantages of such meters. It
is even possible that one of the reasons why they
boldly violate the law and illegally demand the deposit
i- because they have such meters, and wish to secure
their pay in advance in case a kick comes on account
of the results of the reverse action.
ACCESSORIES BEFORE THE FACT.
IT is impossible to commend on any conceivable
ground the attitude ot the Democratic press and
a smail portion of the Democratic party in the Sen
atorial contest now pending at Sacramento. Under
the tutelage of the principal organ of the party in this
city a sentiment of glee has been fostered over the
candidacy of Dan Burns. In short, the Democracy is
rejoicing at the beautiful predicament in which the
Republican party is placed, and it is fair to assume
, from the expressions of its organs that if the race
track gambler and political boss is finally foisted
| upon it there will be general jubilation among the
Democratic leaders.
This sentiment is founded entirely upon political
i feeling. It has no higher inspiration than the, thought
that if the Republicans elect Dan Burns Senator it
will result in a sweeping Democratic victory in this
city next year and in the State in iooo. The latter
campaign will involve not only the Presidency, but a
Senatorship, and the Democracy hopes that if Burns
is chosen they will carry the State for the Democratic
candidate for President and elect a Senator to suc
ceed Senator Perkins.
While this may be denominated politics, it cannot
jbt commended on grounds of morality or decency. A
; Democratic newspaper conniving at the election of
\ Dan Burns is engaged in quite as disreputable busi
ness as a Republican paper similarly employed. Over
i and beyond the political character of United States
| Senators there exists the welfare of the State and its
'. people. When California sinks so low as to send for
j its representative in the upper house of Congress a
j political boss, a racetrack gambler and a corruption-
I ist, the commonwealth will have reached a state of
I development which cannot fail to result in its un-
doing.
For a political party to hope for such a condition
is little less than criminal. And for Democratic news
papers or Democratic legislators to connive and abet
the realization of such an event betrays a condition
01 degeneracy that is simply appalling.
What the Democracy and its organs should do is
to aid the respectable Republican newspapers in de
feating the gigantic conspiracy which contemplates
the election of Dan Burns to the United States Sen
ate. This conspiracy has been organized by the rail
road, and is being carried out by the worst elements
in the Republican party. Unless it can be defeated
the State is going to be irretrievably damaged. The
evil effects of its consummation will be felt by Demo
crats and Republicans alike, and the disgrace cannot
fail to inflict injury upon the interests of all the
people.
Unless the Democratic party and its organs desire
to earn everlasting infamy, they will abandon their
secret attempts to aid the candidacy of Burns and go
in with decent Republicans to encompass his defeat.
THOSE CONFEDERATE PENSIONS.
THE CALL recently suggested that Senator But
ler's proposition to admit ex-Confederate vet
erans to the Federal pension roll would not ap
peal to those veterans. Our position was promptly
confirmed by the ex-Confederates themselves.
The Confederate Veteran Camp of New York has
since passed the following resolution, offered by Com
rade Beasley, himself from North Carolina, Senator
Butler's State:
Resolved. That the Confederate Veteran Camp of
New York condemns in unmeasured terms the ef
forts of Senator Butler of North Carolina (who is
not a Confederate veteran) to debauch the manhood
of the South by seeking to obtain pensions for ex-
Confederate soldiers from the United States, and that
any similar effort by any Southern member of Con
gress will be abhorrent to this camp and meet with
unqualified condemnation.
The Senator seems to have had no conception of
the affront he offered to the manhood of the men
; who threw their lives in the balance for what they
thought to be right, and, losing their cause, lost it
I like men and not like cringing beggars. It is to be
i forever remembered, to the credit of the Southern
people, that they have supported without complaint
! the taxation necessary to pension the Union soldiers
I whom they disabled in civil strife, while at the same
time caring adequately for their own maimed or
weakened in the vain struggle they maintained so
long and so bravely.
The hostile reception they have everywhere given
i to Senator Butler's proposition is proof that they can
sustain the access of good feeling as our fellow coun-
trymen without any sordid inducement, and this very
attitude adds to the happiness and confidence which
have attended the mutual expressions of good will
from both sides of Mason and Dixon's line.
That line itself is likely to hereafter be remembered
more as the work of those two eminent English as
tronomers and Fellows of the Royal Society of Brit
ish Scientists than as the former line dividing slave
and free States and union and disunion.
The discussion of this subject of pensions has
brought to general knowledge the fact that Confed
erate veterans will not even care for admission to the
National Soldiers' Homes, for the reason that the
Southern States have built and equipped such homes
for their own who need them, and the old soldiers
are more likely to be contented in the midst of their
own people than far removed to the national institu
tions.
Time will soon efface all that tells of our civil
struggle except the memory of it, and it is a tribute to
American manliness that that memory on each side
will be so softened toward the other, and that the valor
of all who fought will be cherished as the common
heritage of their children to the remotest time.
Readers will also remember that The Call was in
strumental in the detection and capture of the late
Frank Belew.
Perhaps James Gallagher really broke his own head
and then filled his corpse with lead. But those who
[ witnessed the phenomenon ought to give the details.
WINE MEN ARE
VERY PROPERLY
EXASPERATED
Resent the Slight to
Their Industry.
CRITICIZE THE COMMITTEE
THE "LEMONADE FEAST" NOT
TO THEIR LIKING.
Declare That the Legislators' Action
Was an Unjustifiable Blow to
One of the State's Great
est Intei ests.
The announcement that the committee
of the Legislature having in charge the
banquet of the Governor's inaugural ball
had decided not to serve wine at that
function, and the publication of the menu
card showing that lemonade was the star
beverage, has most properly exasperated
the wine men of California.
It appears to them almost inconceivable
that such a thing could happen in this
famous home of the vine. They have
been discussing the matter during the
past two days in no complimentary man
ner, so far as the men responsible for
the act are concerned. They call atten
tion to the fact that the State of Cali
fornia, through its Legislature, has for
many years by generous appropriations
greatly fostered the viticultural industry,
and that by reason of such assistance
that Industry has grown to be one of the
greatest in the State â that carries an
investment of more than $60,000,600, em
ploying thousands of people and paying
about a fifth of the realty and personal
property taxes of the commonwealth.
They further speculate upon the obvious
fact that in due course of time the mak
ing of wine in ths Golden State will be a
paramount interest.
After such reflections these men natur
ally ask what influence was powerful
enough to induce a committee of the Leg
islature to give to the wine industry such
an uncalled-for and damaging slap in the
face; and, moreover, to parade to the
world the fact that the lawmaking power
of the State deliberately discredited one
of its pet industries. The allegation is
most earnestly made that California's
dry, .wholesome wines properly belonged
upon the banquet table, and that people
at thai table were not required to par
take of them. And, finally, they make
what is probably a deserved comment to
the eftect that the lemonade was doubt
less "made from limes imported from
Mexico or lemons from Sicily." The an
nexed interviews from men distinctively
representing the two great branches of
the Industry will suffice to show the pre
vailing sentiment:
"1 consider this action of the legisla
tive committee a direct reflection upon
the people of California that an industry
paying nearly a nfth of all the taxes of
Lhe State should receive at the hanas of
their representatives such an insult," said
Charles. E. Bovven of the Wetmore-Bowen
Company. "Wheat, wine and wood have
tor years been the mainstay of taxation
in tniÃ State. Agriculture in its varied
form is the new life and wealth ol the
State. Why denounce and advertise to
the world by State sanction, through
State oillclals, one of its life-giving indus
tries? It it were in.my power i would
deduct from, the salary of each responsi
ble legislator -" per cent 'of his pay, or an
amount equal to that contributed by the
wine industry toward his salary. The
average California legislator who would
be "tempted' by the sight of a bottle of
California wine served at a gubernatorial
banquet need not 'reach' for it if his idea
of temperance intrudes, It i.-> to be hoped
that btate legislation against California
raisins, the seeds of which have been
known to produce appendicitis, will not
tollow."
"This action of the legislative committee
Is an unwarranted "blow to one of tne
most important industries of this State
and a gratuitous insult from the Legis
lature," said Andrea Sbarboro, secretary
of the Italian-Swiss Agricultural Colony,
and president of the .Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association. â¢""California nas
such an immense territory sparsely set
tled, and what it wants most is a popu
lation of thriving agriculturists, who,
while producing a certain line of agri
cultural products, will also consume otner
products of the State and make th; com
monwealth more prosperous. There are
many industries of the State which can
compete with other States of the Union,
but there is only one industry which has
absolutely no competition. The great ar
chitect of the universe seems to have
given to only one of the States of the
Union, tmd that" California, a soil and
climate required to produce as fine wines
as those of Italy and France. With tins
blessing California has also within
easy reach a mighty population to suppiy
with uus most healthful, nourishing and
not intoxicating beverage.
"While the little republic of Chile, with
a territory and population about as large
as tuoi: of the State of California, now
produces and con;, lmes 75,000,000 gallons
of wine per annum, the State of Califor
nia barely brings forth a third of that
quantity. With 70,000,000 of Inhabitants in
the United States, with Its wine trade al
ready extended to the Central and South
American republics, to England, Belgium,
Switzerland and Germany, where the wine
connoisseurs of Europe prefer the pure
grape Juice of California to the same class
of wines produced in Italy and France,
the State can hardly dispose of the small
Quantity of wine which it now produces,
and, strange to say, some of the greatest
drawbacks to this important industry are
caused by some of the misguided people
of California. In fact, if the Legislature
acted for the true interests of the State
if would devote its energies to and ap
propriate millions of dollars for the de
velopment of this great industry and the
encouragement of the American peopie to
the general use of light wines at their
table, whereby the curse of drunkenness
would be driven from the State and from
the United States.
"It is a well known fact that in the
wine-drinking countries of the world in
toxication is practically unknown, yet our
own Legislature a few days ago passed
a resolution declaring that the members
of the Legislature and the high officials
and society people, who might attend the
banquet to be given after the inaugur.il :
ball, were not sufficiently civilized to be
able to sit at a feast where wine was
served and control themselves in such a
manner as becomes decent people. The
great lawmakers therefore prohibited the
use of wine at the banquet.
"Now. when we consider that the State
of California is as large as the kingdom
of Italy, where one billion gallons of wine
is produced annually, which quantity
could also be produced in this State, thus
giving employment to ten millions of p^o
ple and enhancing the value of grazing
and so as to pay interest on a valuation
of $100 per acre, it should certainly be the
business and the duty of our law-makers
to encourage instead of discredit this
great and promising branch of our agri
culture.
"The wine men will remember their en
emies." :
ACCORDED MASONIC HONORS.
Charles M. Chase's Remains Interred
in Laurel Hill Cemetery.
The funeral of the late Charles M.
Chase took place at 2 o'clock yesterday
from the Masonic Temple. The remains
were interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery.
Mr. Chase, being a member of Doric
Lodge and also the California Command
ers', was accorded the full ceremonies of
the order by his brother Masons The
services took place in King Solomon's
Hall and was conducted by Worshipful
Master Simon Myrson of Doric Lodge
The casket was hidden from sight be

deceased in token of their esteem and
love.
Doric Lodge was represented by Moritz

ANOTHER STORM COMING.
Weather Officials Say the Prospects
Are Excellent for More Rain.
Professor Hammon of the Weather Bu
reau said late last evening that the con
ditions were becoming more and more
favorable for another storm. The pres
sure has begun to fall all along the
coast, the weather is foggy and the wind
easterly, and all of these are good fore
runners of a storm.
"I do not know lust how much of this
storm we will get," said Professor Ham
mon, "or just when it will strike us, but
from local signs it should rain again Fri
day night. The barometer rose some on
Wednesday, but it has been on the down
grade ever since. The weather conditions
have been behaving beautifully and we
must admit that the backbone of the
drought has been effectually broken. The
great rise in the Sacramento River is a
sure sign that the last rain fully per
formed its duty and the ground got pretty
thoroughly filled with water. The pecu
liarity of all the clearings since January
1 lies in the fact that they have not heen
followed by north wind and cold weather,
and under those conditions m is easier for
rain to return again. Besides the moist
ure In the ground has not been drunk up
almost immediately by the cold winds.
â J â¢ v'dence presented to us is for still
mori â 
"Ni tide of this State escaped the
t:crciu ie last precipitation, and all
the rain necessary to assure bright crop
prrspects fell everywhere except, per
haps, in the Upper San Jriaquin Valley.
The seasonal rainfall for this city is now
6.&5 inches, about twice as much as laat
season." _______^___
DECLINE TO ACCEPT
THE NEW CITY HALL
SUPERVISORS DECIARE IT IS
NOT COMPLETE.
Building Committee of the Board In
vites Bids for the New Police
Station on Seventeenth
Street.
The Building Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday afternoon and
declined to accept the new City Hall from
the Commissioners who had charge of Its
construction. They took this decided
stand on the ground that the building was
already sadly in need of repairs and that
it was not fair to make it a charge upon
the resources of the Supervisors.
The commission having it in charge is
composed of the Mayor, Auditor and City
and County Attorney. Tho Mayor is the
only member of the old board, which re
ported the building as being completed,
who is now in office. Architect Shea wai
present and said no money had ever been
spent on the building in the nature of re
j:tirs and as a consec^ence the iron work
was rusting away. Its life could be pro
longed with proper care, but this it had
never received.
Clerk Russell told of the bad condition
in which the ceilings on the top floor were
lcfl by the man who built the new roof.
The plaster is falling steadily, and in
many places requires immediate attention.
The "eommitteemen claimed that the retir
ing Commissioners should have in
corporated in their report a statement as
to the exact condition of all portions of
the building. The report was referred
back.
It was dptermined to advertise for bids
for the new police station in keeping with
the revised plans submitted by Architect
Shea. Tn these rod brick take the place
of pressed brick, and other minor changes
are made in order that the building may
come within the appropriation of $50,000
allowed by the last Board of Supervis
ors. At a recent meeting of the I-inance
Committee of the present hoard Chairman
Perruult suggested that this appropriation
might be stricken out in order to cut down
the expenditures of the board. This sug
gestion has not taken definite shape yet.
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.
Coroner Hill Will Stop the Prema
ture Embalming of Bodies.
Certain undertakers in this city are in
the habit of embalming bodies before tho
death certificate has been signed and in
several instances during the past two
years the evidence in cases of suspected
malpractice and poisoning has been cov
ered up and destroyed.
Two death certificatea were presented
yesterday to Coroner Hill for his signa
tureâone of Minnie Sutter of 80 Jackson
street, 2fl years o!d. Dr. Edward Selzer
was the attending physician and he cer
tified that the cause of death was alco
holi.-in and apoplexy. The body, how
ever, had been embalmed by Undertaker
Metzler. The other case was that of El
len F. Nelson, a married woman, 35 years
old, whose residence was 1722 Twelfth ave
nue. Dr. Alfred McLaughlin was the at
tending; physician and he certified that
peritonitis was the cause of death. This
body had been embalmed by the Pacific"
Undertaking Company. t
Dr. Hill said he was determined to put
a stop to the tampering with human
bodies after death and before the death
certificate had been signed and approved,
and to that end he issued the following
circular yesterday:
Attention is particularly called to the fact
that the law is being violated when bodies are
being injected before certificates of death are
accepted by the health authorities.
V"ii will please see that the certificate is
satisfactory to the Coroner or the health au
thorities before injecting or in any way inter
fering with the body. Notice is hereby given
that violators of this rule will be summarily
dealt with. I trust that this office will have
the hearty co-operation of the undertaking pro
fession in this matter.
HELP FROM THE SOUTH.
Los Angeles Merchants Working for
San Francisco's New Charter.
The Merchants' Association of this city
has a strong friend in the Merchants' and
Manufacturers' Association of Los Ange

cure the adoption of the new charter by
the voters of San Francisco, and frequent
ly words of encouragement were received
from the affiliating organization in the
southern part of the State. The charter
is now before the Legislature, and the
Los Angeles merchants manifest their
good will hy taking action to have the
charter made a law, as shown by the fol
lowing communication received yesterday:
Whereas, the people of the city of San Fran
clflco have adopted a new charter for that city,
which is now pending before the Legislature
of the State for ratification; ami
Whereas, we deem the principle of home rule

BABNEY KEARNEY'S DEATH.
Verdict That It Was Caused by Par
ties Unknown.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterday
morning on the body of Barney Kearney,
who died at the City and County Hospi
tal on January 8 from the effect of a frac
tured skull. The testimony was that on
New Year's day deceased was struck on
the head with a bottlp in a saloon on the
corner of Folsom and Spear streets owned
by C. O'Donnell, a nephew of the dead
man.
The injured man was taken to the Har
bor Hospital and a lacerated wound in
his scalp was sewed up, the surgeons not
having- discovered that the skull had been
fractured. Kearney went to work the
next day, but had to knock off, and was
sent to the County Hospital, where he
died.
It was reported at the time that the
blow hud been inflicted by O'Donnell, but
the widow of Kearney testified yesterday
that her husband did not give the name
of his assailant. A verdict was rendered
implicating a party or parties unknown.

WHO WILL GO
TO GUAM?
Among the members of the Pacific Coast
Naval Colony there Is much speculation
regarding the appointment of Captain
Henry Glass to the Governorship of
Guam. The word has been passed along
that it is taking a "snap Judgment 1 on
Glass, who is tossing on the Pacific en
route from Manila to San Francisco and
is totally ignorant of the soft thing the
Vavy Department is piling up for him.
Cong ago the gallant captain slated him
stlf for the new Training Station at Goat
Island, and he is enthusiastic upon the
suhject of teaching Uncle Sam's young
sailors ideas how to shoot like Dewey.
And the department knows he Is just
about the right man for the new blue
jacket schoolhouse at Yerba Buena.
Now Captain Glass will be about as well
please* over his job at Guam as he would
be if the Government would make him
superintendent of a home for superannu
ated seals on one of the Pribyloff Islands,
and when he lands at San Francisco,
which will be in a few days, the wires
will grow warm between this port and
Washington. He will want to know who
the thunder around the Bureau of Navi
gation has a grudge against him ana I
he finds out the barometer in that per
son's latitude and longitude will take a
a Guam is a arty dab of land on the map

and couldn't load /Glass ln %* Chief or
and shoot him into Guam. The Chlel or
the Bureau of Navigation ought to know
that Henry will kick like the re Â«oll â  pf ag
send him to Guam, but he won : go. Xou
send him to Guam, but he won t go. You
see, he ha* been triced up on board the
rotten old Independence at Mare Island
off and on for years. In fact, like old
Paddy White's ghost that haunts the
gun deck of the Guardo at midnight.
KempfE owns a plank in the ancient hulk.
He is one of the few officers on the station
that have been kept here right along.
When the fighting began most of the
available officers on this coast were
shipped East for service. The navy-yard
was pretty well cleaned out, and the re
maining officers there howled over thÂ«
little extra duty falling to their lot ana
also because they were missing a chance
to jump up in the line of promotion.
Hughes was snatched out of the Hydro
graphic office, and MacMillan, his clerk,
who is an Annapolis graduate, was given
a commission and sent to Manila. Stoney
at the enlisting rendezvous was chased off
to Cuba, and eventually fetched up as a
teacher of navigation in the academy. By
the way, why don't Crowninshield send,
Stoney to Guam? There is an officer that
would" take to the place and be an honor
to the job. Stoney's heart and soul 13
burled in the Pacific or along its shores,
and, beinp: tired of hammering 'sights*
into the heads of the cadets, he would
pack his traps for Guam at an hour's no
tice.

.. "Detective Dillon. He was in the ilympia
J "sa-hoon New Year's evening and left be- .

CATTLE ENDANGERED
BY THE BIG STORM
PASTTJBE LANDS ALONG SAN
PABLO BAY FLOODED.
A Breaking Levee Puts Tubbs Island
Completely Under
Water.
The storm on Wednesday afternoon
caused an unusually high tide in the bay
and did considerable damage along the
shores of Marin County. Pasture land
was flooded in many places and the Bat
tle were rescued with great difficulty.
: Tubbs Island, near the mouth of Petalu
: ma Slough, was completely flooded, but
! fortunately the cattle were saved.
When the tide was at its height the
levee which protects the pasture land
gave way and water poured over the
island. The sheep were driven across the
bridge to the mainland and the larger
â  found shelter on the island.
Tfirnm Tubbs of the Tubba Cordage
Company, who owns the island, has not
yet been able to make an estimate of Ids
"The island consists of about 1500
lie said, "of which a large portion
ild out in grain. The remainder is
pasture land. I do not know how much
damage has been don- 1 by ih.> storm. The
Wednesday afternoon and the
whole inland is still i:ndÂ»>r wati-r. From
what I can learn the livestock la ail saved.
The fields which are under water are
and it is not likely that
they will be badly damaged, as the water
will drain off with the outgoing tide. I
understand that the low-lying pasture
land.s of Mario County have all been
Hooded and some cattle have perished."
MEASLES AT VANCOUVER.
Mustering Out of the Eighth B-egi
meut May Be Delayed by the
Prevailing Epidemic.
There may be some delay in the m
ing out of the companies of the Eighth
Regiment row stationed at Vancouver
Barracks. It is not that the men ar> not
ready to leave the service, or that Cap
tain Taylor, who is to pay and dismiss
them from the employ of L'ncle Sam. is
not ready to do his work, but the measles
and mumps have called a short and sharp
halt.
An officer just down from Vancouver
; that there are nearly a hundred
of measles and mumps among the
men of the companies now there, and that
the two diseases are rapidly becoming an
::iir\ Kor this reason the men are all
the more anxious to get away, but many
of them are in the hospital and it is un
safe for them to leave at present.
It was just at this time last year that
the Fourteenth Infantry, which was tnen
at Vancouver, suffered from an epidemic
of mepsles. There have been no deaths
reported from the epidemic as yet, but
the men will have to be careful, aa expo
sure frequently results fatally.

IT WAS BOUNDING A CXTRVE AT
FIFTY MILES AN HOUR.
Q. F. Richardson, Master of Trans
portation, Says That It Was
an Unavoidable Acci
dent.
The officials of the Southern Pacific had
very little to say yesterday concerning
the wreck of the "Owl" near Ingomar on
Wednesday night. Master of Transporta
tion Richardson, in speaking of the acci
dent, said:
"It was one of those unfortunate acci
dents that could not be foreseen. When
the train rounded the curve it was run
ning at a high rate of speed and the sheep
were huddled on the track. There were
several hundred of them; they were lying
down and had no chance to get off. The
Engineer Wood of the Wrecked
"Owl," Who Was Killed-
engine ran on top of them and was
thrown from the track. You know sheep
are the most dreaded of all animals by
railroad men. They will derail a train
quicker than any other kind of an animal.
The 'Owl' will go through all right to
day, as the wreck has been cleared."
At the time of the accident it was very
dark and the rain was falling-, while the
wind was blowing a gale. Engineer Wood
had not a moment's warning. Such was
the force of the collision that the head
light of the engine was smashed, while
the smokestack was twisted. The engine
turned a somersault and fell- into a con
struction car that was on the sidetrack,
completely -wrecking it. That there was
no loss of life on the part of the passen
gers is due to the fact that there was no
one in the day -coach. One of *the sleepers
left the track, as did the baggage and day
coach. The engine was almost demol
ished. Engineer Wood was rescued as
soon as he could be got from under the
debris, but he was so badly* scalded by
the escaping steam that his case was
hopeless. Death mercifully ended his suf
ferings. His remains were brought to
Oakland yesterday morning.
Conductor Henry Brydges pent a man
back to Los Banos, a distance of nine
miles. Finally news of the wreck was
got to Oakland, and within a half hour
from the time that the notice was re
ceived a wrecking train, with sleepers for
the comfort of the passengers, was well
on its way to the wreck. No. 17 was held
for some time to prevent a collision. After
a few hours' work the track was cleared
and the passengers were taken to Tracy
and sent to Los Angeles by Lathrop.
TWO SYMPHONIES
PLAYED BY SCHEEL
Owing to some delay in the arrival of
the scores Russia was not represented In
yesterday's symphony programme. There
was no Borodin, no Rimsky-Korsakoff.
Instead we had Beethoven's first sym
phony and the unfinished one by Schu
bert â excellent performances both. The
Beethoven symphony Scheel read in the
only effective wayâ the Mozartlan wayâ
without any false rubato and without any
strained emphasis. His rendition was ex
tremely simple, full of sweetness and
rhythm. The Schubert symphony is n -Vi
ferent sort of work; it calls for virtuo
sity; and it got it in splendid measure.
Scheel has played this work on several
occasions, and It is necessary only to say
that yesterday's performance was a cor
rnboration of previous applause. The
Wagner "Faust" overture, a couple of
Brahms' Hungarian dances and the
scherzo from Bizet's "Roma" suite com
posed the balance of the programme. The
audience was large and apparently
pleased with everything except the tem
perature of the Orpheum, which was sev
eral degrees below comfort.
A New Law Firm.
W. C. Van Fleet, ex-Justice of the Su
preme Court, has formed a partnership
with E. B. and George H. Mastick, for
merly the law firm of Mastick & Mastick,
with offices in the Mills building. The
new law firm has taken the name of Mas
tick, Van Fleet & Mastick. Soon after it
was known that Justice Van Fleet was to
retire from the Supreme bench it was un
derstood among the Judges, most personal
friends that he would cast his lot with
the firm of Mastick & Mastick.
It was with much regret that his col
leagues on the bench parted with Judge
Van Fleet and they did all in their pow
er to retain his valuable services by of
fering him a position as one of the Court
Commissioners. Although it was an offer
that many a lawyer would have Jumped
at Judge Van Fleet declined with thanks
and immediately made arrangements to
perfect the details of the partnership with
ilu Uastlcks. The offices in the Mills
building will be retained.
Testify in Favor of Ashe.
The Dennery-Ashe contest dragged
along wearily yesterday and may not be
concluded for several days yet. The tes
timony put in by Porter Ashe is all to
the same effect, the intimidation of vot
ern and the favoritism shown the workers
for Dennery by the police. The case will
go on again this morning.
Washington Council, Y. M. I.

give an entertainment and ball in Union
pquare Hall this evening. The committee
on entertainment has prepared a first

Wanted for Bigamy.
Delia McDevftt, living at 20 Folsom
street, swore to a complaint in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday charging John
Smith, a bartender, with bigamy. She
was married to Smith at Reno, iNev., Jiui
vary 5 on Smith's assurance that he was
divorced from his former wife in the
East. Now she has learned that he was
not divorced and that he intends to leave

Finance Committee of Supervisors
May Cancel the Contract for
Collecting Taxes.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors will meet this morning, and
among other matters will consider the
contract entered into with the law firms
of Rodgers, Paterson & Slack and Devlin
& Devlin. This relates to the collection
of money claimed to be due the city from
the State, arising from services and out
lays connected with the assessment,
equalization and collection of taxes. In a
long communication to the board yester
day the lawyers affirm that they have
been maligned by persons unfamiliar with
their claims, and object to their contracts
being rescinded. In conclusion they say:
Having a contract that provides for contin
gent compensation. If you prevent us from
carrying out our part of the contract, the
fault is yours and not ours; and you would
be responsible to us for what, under the cm
tract, we might he entitled to. But if you
desire to abandon the course which you have
pursued, in attempting to secure for the coun
ty money that belongs to It and desire to sur
render such money to the Stat". you have but
to express that desire to us and you will be
accorded the same right that a lawyer extends
to any client, to pay up as far as you have
gone and quit. If you had made or desire to
make still such a request, you would have
encountered no difficulty. In the meantime
we must firmly protest against any action
taken to rescind the contract in which we have
an interest without our rons=Â°nt.
UPROAR IN THE PRISON.
Henry Schoen Becomes Violently In

August Schoen, who was arrested a few
days ago for passing fictitious checks, be

EDDIE BALD, CHAMPION
BICYCLIST, IS HERE
ON A PLEASURE TRIP, WITH
JOCKEY TOD SLOAN.
He Expects to Ride at the Indoor
Meet Next Month, and
Later Go to Europe.
Eddie C. Bald, the champion short dis- !
tance cyclist of the world, arrived yester- !
day morning, accompanied by Tod Sloan
and C. F. Dwyer. and is stopping at the '
lalace. The party left New York a month !
ago and have been making the trip hv |
easy stages, spending the last week duck !
hunting in Southern California.
This is Bald's third visit to this city he '
having been here in the fall of 1896 and
again in ISftfi. He raced then at San Joso !
and several other places, but not in this
city as there was no track here.
For the past four years Raid has held I
the short distance championship of Amer
ica against all the cracks of his class. At
the half, mile and two miles he is practi
cally invincible. Although he has suffer
ed defeat some few times, yet when the
records were compiled at the close of the
in he was always on top with a bi<
margin. s
Bald is without question the most pop- j
ular racing man of the day with clubmen
spectators and his opponents as well. His i
gentlemanly manners, fair riding and '
pleasing address win him hosts of
friends. This was further attested yes
terday when as .soon as his arrival was
noised around cydedom. his letter-box at
the hotel began to till with the cards of !
his visitors until nearly every notable in j
the sport here had paid his respects.
To a Call reporter Bald said: "Although
J am on a pleasure trip purely as a rest !
after a hard season's work I may ride
here at the proposed indoor tournament
next month. Powers, Brady and Kenne
dy, the managers, are all good friends of ;
mine and square sports, and if they con- i
duct a meet you can depend upon it that !
it will be a good one. If I decide to re- !
main in California to get into condition !
for next season I will probably be here i
until April. I have had several good of
fers to ride in Europe next season and :
will probably accept. Give all the boys '
of the Bay City and Olympic clubs my \
best regards and tell them they wii'l
doubtless see 'Eddie' in harness at the j
Pavilion races next month."
Bald looks heavier than when he was
hers before, and probably tips the scale
at 170 pounds in racing costume. With
the arrival of Jimmy Michael, the cham
pion middle distance rider of thf world, !
later this month San Francisco will con
tare the two greatest men in the world !
in the sport of cycling.
An Incorrigible Girl.
Mabel Gaffer, a girl 15 yf-ars of age,
was sent to the Magdalen Asylum yester
day by Judge Conlan. She is an Incorrigi
ble girl and wants to be bad. When her
parents died she was adopted by Mrs. M.
; Montenegro, 309 Fulton street, but for ths
i past six months she has been behaving
iin a most shocking manner. A few nights
: ago she cut off her long hair and toid
â  Mrs. Montenegro that she intended to
' sell It co that she and her lover could
j leave the city. She declined to say who
: was her youngr lover. She declared that
; she wanted to lead a bad life and nothing
i could stop her. She was taken to Secre
: tary Kane's office by Mrs. Montenegro,
: and when left alone for a few minutes
I broke everything she could lay her
; hands on.
His Whiskers Saved Him.
Because his wife took $8 out of his pock
ets yesterday afternoon Charles Freel, a
janitor, living at 708 Fulton street, took
a knife and tried to rut Ms throat. His
whiskers saved him from making deep
wounds, and when he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital the doctors only found
two small scratches. He had been drink
ing.

CALIFORNIAN
BOYS' HEALTH
IMPROVING
Senator Brings News
From the First.
SICKNESS GREATLY REDUCED
THE ASTOR BATTERY HOME TO
BE MUSTERED OUT.
Captain A- P. O'Brien Returns in
Charge of Sick Soldiers and
Captain "Warren With
Dispatches.
The United States transport Senator re
turned from Manila last night with 130
soldiers on board. Among these are eight
convalescents, two of whom are from the
First California. None of them are seri
ously ill.
The Astor Battery came home on tho
transport, and it is expected that it will
be immediately ordered to New York,
where it will be mustered out. The bat-
tery includes eighty-three men under
command of Captain March. But one man
was left behind besides the five who were
killed in the battle on the 13th of last
August. Sergeant Harry L. Burdick.who
is in the hospital suffering from typhoid
fever, was too sick to be brought back.
Captain A. P. O'Brien, surgeon of the
First California, came under orders in
chargp of the sick on board the Senator.
Captain E. C. Malaby of the same regi
ment was detailed as his assistant. Dr.
O'Brien reports that the health of tho
boys of his regiment has greatly im
proved in the last two months. The sick
ness in the First California and the en
tire Eighth Army Corps has been mate
rially reduced; at the time of the depart
ure of the Senator it was a little under S
per cent. While Captain O Brien is stil
in the service and is here under orders it
is believed that he will receive his dis
charge in a short time, when he will re
sume his position on the Board of Health
relieving l>r. Gallwey, who has been at
tending to the duties of the office during
Dr. O'Brien's absence.
Corporal Fred Healy of Company H,
the special correspondent of The Call who
=ent this paper so many interesting sto
ries of the every day soldier life of his
comrades cf the First California Regiment
received his discharge some time ago on
account of disability. He has fully re
covered from his illness, and after mak
ing a visit to Hongkong and the interior
of Japan, will return home on the Rio de
Janeiro, which was to sail on the t 19th of
last month and is due here on the 24th
ln Among the other officers on the Senator
are Captain, F. W. Warren of the First
California, lieutenant E. J. Bryan of the
Oregon and Major R. B. C Bement of the
Minnesota regiment, detailed on General
Merritt'a staff. Captain Warren has been
intrusted with dispatches to the War
Department at Washington and will leave
for the Capitol City within a few days.
Lieutenant Bryan is en route to Port
land and Major Bement to St. Paul, at
which places they Are to await orders.
The two sick California boys are Cor
poral Ammerson of Company B and Pri
vate Cook of Company F. Ammerson is
convalescing from a wound received in
the arm during the battle of August 13
and Cook's complaint is bowel trouble.
The other invalids are: Colonel C. \\.
Whipple of the ordnance department of
xhe regular army; Sergeant Shou of the
Fourth United States Cavalry; Privates
Newgard and Terry of the Minnesota
regiment; Windsor of the Colorado and
Slater of Idaho.
The Senator made the passage from Ma- ;
nila in twenty-eight days and from Isa- |
gaÂ«aki in twenty. She encountered some i
rather severe days during the voyage and |
had to lay to seven hours, but sustained :
no damage. The Ohio started from Ma- j
nila with the Senator and the two yes- j
sels made the run to Nagasaki together, i
At that port the Ohio stopped to coal and
was not to leave until two days after the
Senator.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
. NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â net exchanges for
the day were rather mixed, but with a pre
ponderance of gains. The movements seemed
largely to be the outcome of an organized
campaign against the short Interests. One \
group of stocks after another were boosted,
leaving the bears in doubt where the next move
would Bet in. The activity and strength was
in the giltertged railway shares, and then suc
cessively drifted into the Paclflce. the Flower
stocks and then back into the Pacifies again. j
Great Northern preferred made an extreme j
gain of 7%, Pennsylvania 4. Jersey Central 4.
American District Telegraph 5%, Third Ave
nue 3, Brooklyn Transit 2%, Norfolk and West
ern 2, Burlington 1%, and the Pacifies 2 to
3'j. rart of which were lost in the late dealings.
The iron and steel shares showed a lagging
tendency, although they, too, enjoyed periods j
of strength. London was again a seller on j
balance, although arbitrage dealings were
somewhat interrupted, as the cable worked
poorly. Predictions of a very favorable De
cember statement stimulated interest in Bur
lington. Northern Pacific was stronger on ru
mors that some arrangement of their differ
ences with rival companies were likely. The ;
purchasers of Jersey Central, rumor had it. I
were by insiders In expectation of increased
traffic, because of new industries recently es
tablished along the line.
The extent of recent sales for London ac
count if shown by the large borrowing of
stocks in this market until the stocks sold
arrive from the other side. It is estimated ,
that fully 150,000 shares of stock is now bor- i
- wed here, of which 100,000 are expected to 1
arrive by Saturday week. Chicago is display
ing great interest in the New York market, and i
it Is estimated that nearly a quarter of the
business of the exchange comes over Chicago
wires. Transactions In stocks was little short '
of a million shares. Realizations in final deal
ings gave the market a heavy tone at the
closing.
Improvement occurred in the bond prices in !
.the forenoon, but the market later showed !
weakness in spots and closed irregular. Total
sales. $5,136,000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â There was enough bull
ish feeling among traders carried over from
yesterday to start wheat strong, although the
general situation before business began sug
gested a downward course. Liverpool 'cables
came only %d higher and the price currents
prospects for winter wheat were more encour
aging. One point concerning domestic receipts |
was interpreted favorably to the bulls. May I
opened a shade lower at 70 ,Â»'a71c, and as the i
market began to show strength shorts took fright ;
and covered. As there was very little for sale I
competition soon helped the price and May ad- ;
vanced to 71% c. A private message from a !
leading local trader who is abroad reported i
| Russians canceling rye seals and declared that
i France web a buyer of wheat. This had ;a '
1 bullish effect, and as a New York syndicate
I which was reported long about 5.000,000 bushels ;
1 bought on. every little dip the price held stead
ily within , %c s of the top the greater portion
of the session. Reports received late In the |
day said that the Argentine wheat crop would j
i be of large i proportions and the grain of good I
quality. As the expectation of a deficit in that i
quarter has been one of the sustaining fea- j
i tures here of late this piece of news had a
> weakening effect and May declined to 70%
; buyers, . tne closing price.
Damp weather and bullish news from the
country concerning the demand for feeding and i
reducing stock* in first hands strengthened
corn. When wheat In the last hour began to
! droop corn followed, getting very heavy near \
i the end. Selling orders began pouring into I
the pit. May closed a shade higher than yes- |
terday.
Light offerings and email receipts strength- !
! ened oats. There was a good export inquiry I
and a few speculative orders were sufficient, I
;to send prices upward. Near the end. howV
1 ever, cats yielded with the other grains. May/
; closed a shade higher. f
A light run of hogs and a good export de- !
mand for meat products started provisions
strong. The market was called upon to ab- '
â  sorb a good deal of long property, but as com- i
! mission houses bought freely prices were well !
â  maintained until wheat and corn began to show â 
I weakness. Then provisions became quite heavy
and the early gain was lost. May pork closed
5c lower. May lard â  24c lower and May rlbÂ« i
24c lower.

CALIFORNIA PRUNES IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Jan. I!.â Journal of Com
merce says: Recent offerings of Pacific Coast
prunes at auction have had a depressing Influ
ence upon spot prices, from which the market
seems to be recovering as a result of stronger,
reports ' from California. Stocks on the coast
are reported to be unusually small for this sea
son, and according to latest mall advices from
there holders seem imbued with confidence in
the future and are not disposed to close out
stocks except at full prices. While the de
mand here shows little Improvement there is
reported to-be more inquiry for consumers, as
] the low price for prunes as compared with
| other dried fruits, particularly evaporated ap
ples, are said to be attracting the attention of
buyers. There has been no marked improve-
I ment in spot quotations, but a firmer feeling
j obtains and holders seem less anxious to make
' sales now that cheap auction lots are believed
to be out of the way.

SAN JOSE'S TREASURER
FOR A SINGLE DAY
After a Brief Incumbency Emil G. Levy
Tenders His Resignation to
Mayor Martin.
SAN' JOSE. Jan. 12. â This city Is again without a Treasurer. After hav
ing: filled the office for one short day. Emil G. Levy has resigned. This last
act was a surprise and many sensational stories are afloat in regard to it.
Levy say he resigned because of his business, -which would not allow him to
devote any time to city affairs. Knowing ones say Mayor Martin demanded
his resignation when he found the young man was lacking some requisites
necessary for the office.
The naming of Levy by Mayor Martin for City Treasurer was a surprise
to the politicians and the public generally. City Treasurer Ewing died on
December 31 and a few days later Martin named Joseph F. Colombet for the
place. Colombet had held the office for several terms and proved an effi
cient officer. The Council refused to confirm him because he was anti
gang and had taken a prominent part In the charter election. A second
time the Mayor sent in Colombet's name and it was rejected. On Tuesday
he named Levy, and the Council immediately confirmed him. Yesterday
Levy arranged his bond and this morning he was formally installed.
Shortly after 5 o'clock this afternoon Levy called on Mayor Martin and
tendered his resignation.
Treasurer's office has now been closed for twelve days and business
Is being impede-: _ :â¢ 13*5,000 of city b:>nds and Interest became doe
Â»re was no Treasurer to pay it. The office '.vas opened to-day, but
Levy was unable to reaoh the money in -he Inn-r vault, as Ewing left no
: tr& â ' the combination of the safe. An expert i 3 expected from San
to-morrow to open the -
irs of age and a member of the firm of J. H. Levy & Co
The Council will not l I until next Monday, but it la not belfevpd
â  ~:!i wait ur.til then to name the Treasurer. In all proba
bility a special Council meeting will be called to-morrow.

BIG JIM JEFFRIES
First of All the Sailor Will Be Given
the Best He Has
Earned.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â Tom O'Rourke,
manager of Tom Sharkey, said to-night
that the tone of Jeffries' challenge was
such as to leave the Impression that
the Califomian meant what he said

first opporj;.Â«Tiity for a fight.
"There are so many desirous of meet
ing Sharkey that for the present I am.
undecided what to do," said O'Rourke.

give the sailor a rest, in view of the
fact that he has been fighting almost
continuously for the last three years.
Fitzsimmons, Corbett, Maher, McCoy .
and others all desire a chance at him."
Regarding the report that he would
take Sharkey to England to fight
Charlie Mitchell. O'Rourke said he '
might make the trip if there were
enough money In it. He received a
cablegram from Mitchell to-day and I
answered it, asking whether it was to
be an exhibition or a fight for a purse
offered and before what club.

STATE OF ANARCHY
THROUGHOUT FORMOSA
Bandits Overrun the Island Despite
the Recent Japanese
Victories.
OMA, Jar.. 12.â The steamship Ta- j
coma brings news that an awful state of
anarchy prevails throughout Formosa,
despite the recent victories of the Japan- I
ese 'troops over the Vormosan bandits. ;
The latter have ascort of mountain and I
forest strongholds, and readily move to â¢
another when routed from one. A3 a
rule they do not risk their numb- in
open battle, but prefer guerrilla warfare.
Writing from Twattutia, a well Informed
native correspondent says the Japanese j
are obliged to keep close to a few cen- !
ters where there are garrisons. In
Southern and Central Formosa It Is dan- (
gerous for foreigners to go beyond the â 
strictest treaty port limits. :
Business throughout Formosa Is at a
standstill. The correspondent declares
tiÂ»at commercially Formosa has retro- j
graded very markedly since Japan an- i
nexe-; it. This has resulted largely from j
the refusal of the natives and Chinese i
to cut off their queues and forego other |
ancient customs which the Japanese have
ordered. Merchants are fast converting
their property into cash and escaping to
Amoy until peace is restored. Rich Chi
nese at Amoy have outfitted a number of 1
ftlibustering expeditions, â¢which have suc
ceeded in carrying supplies, arms and am
munition to rebels.

Politics Aroused Jealousy.
"It provokes me," confides a female

That's just what it amounts to. Polities
is nothing to me. Some other -woman's
husband better be yelling 1 for my hus- I
band â that's the way I look at It. Men j
are so silly! They nearly kill thmeseives f
for a person they never saw, because he i
represents something In the party. I re- i
member one Presidential election when '
my husband didn't jet home until 3|
o'clock in the morning 1 . I heard a wheeze
on the stairs, and he burst into the room [
whispering away down in his throatâ he
was so hoarse from shouting 1 â¢ that he |
couldn't speak out loud for days after- i
wardâ 'lt's a landslide!' Poor thing! his i
party hadn't had a landslide for a lor.jr
time. But I can't have proper patience
with such foolishness." â Chicago. Post.

AT TIMES A
SOCIAL LIGHT, AT
TIMES A THIEF
Dual Character of H.
E. Hutcherson.
FROM PARLOR TO PRISON
HE CONFESSES TO NUMEROUS
BURGLARIES.
First Discovered Rifling Lockers in
the Encinal Recreation Club
Rooms in the City of
Alameda.
ALA MED A, Jan. 12.â Herbert E. Hutch
erson, who is held by the police on a
charge of burglary and who has made a
complete confession, is a second edition
of Jekyll and Hyde. One side of his life
In this city was that of a society young
man; the other was that of a petty pil
ferer and burglar. When Hutch^r?on
went out to shine in the more commenda-
ble role of his dual character he dressed
well, spent money freely and was a good
fellow generally. He belonged to che btfct
social organizations and was received Into
the exclusive set. He was looked upon as
a model young inn p..
His election to membership In the En
einal Recreation Club was the beginning
of the end. He had enjoyed the hospitality
â  of the organization but a few weeks when
members began to miss things. First
email articles of little value went, and
then sums of money disappeared from the
lockers of members while they were ex
ercising in the gymnasium. Suspicion
turned toward Hutcherson. Several mem
bers hid themselves on top of the lockers
one evening and watched the young man.
The result of their investigation was not
made public, but at the next meeting of
the directors Hutcherson was expelled.
After his expulsion he went to Mill
Volley and spent a couple of months in
riotous living. People who knew his home
surroundings and were acquainted with
the fact that his parents were having a
hard struggle to get along, questioned
him as to hi? lavish expenditure of mon
ey. He stated that an uncle in the East
was supplying him with funds.
Just before the Recreation Club ex
pelled him over $200 had been stolen from
the lockers of th<- members.
Hutcherson has made a full confession
to the Chief of Police. The department,
however, is disposed to deal leniently with
him. He will be arraigned to-morrow
before Justice Morris, when, it is stated,
the charge against him will be reduced to
petty larceny, to which ;â >â¢ will plead
guilty, and sentence will be suspended
upon" his promise to leave thr Stnte.
A NONSUIT WANTED.
Mrs. Le Protti Has No Case Against
the Railroad.
OAKLAND. Jan. 12.â The case of Mrs.
â  Gugllelmina Le Protti against the Pied-,
mont and Mountain View Railway, one of
the lines of the Oakland Transit Com
pany, came to a sudden end this morni::^,
after the plaintiff had occupied two fiaya
in putting in her evidence. Judge Ogden
held that Mrs. Le Protti had failed to
prove any n.-.idigence on the part of the
railroad company, and granted a nonsuit
in defendant's favor.
Mrs. Le Protti, by her attorneys, Reed
& Nuubaumer, M. C. Chapman and T. M.
Bradley, sued tor $2:>.7Â»i. alleging in her
complaint that she had been damaged to
that extent through injuries received by
her as the result of a collision between
her Ip-undry wagon and one of defendant's
cars on Vernal avenue some time In Oc
tober, 18W. The evidence showed that one
â  I defendant's oars collided with the right
hind wheel of Mrs. Le Prottl'a laundry
wagon and threw her forward to the
ground, knocking on; three of her front
teeth, curling ht-r shin, and causing con
clusion of the spine, which finally resulted
In spinal neurosis, or "railway spine."
It wns further develÂ» ped that Mrs. Le
Prottl's driv.-r. while driving along Vernal
avenue at a safe distance from the rail
way track, turned suddenly toward the
track to pas? an approaching let wagon,
when it appeared that there was plenty
of room fur the laundry wagon to pass
and still keep a safe distance from the
track.
Hairnon Bell, the attornov for the de
fendant, argued that all the negligence
was on the part of plaintiff, and the Judge
so ruled.
Convention Call.
OAKLAND. Jan. 12.â The Republican
City Central Committee held an execu
tive session in the Blake and Moffitt
building to-nignt and issued a call for a
convention t" be held next Monday night,
and E. H. Blake and Daniel Doody were
appointed a committee to secure a hall.
A committee of twenty-one, three mem
bers from each ward, was appointed, who
in turn will select the 143 delegates to
the convention.
Twelve Thousand for Tompkins.
OAKLAND, Jan. 12.â The Supreme
Court has affirmed the verdict In the case
of John W. Tompkins, City Clerk of Oak
land, against George Montgomery, the
millionaire Salvationist, for $12,r.00 dam
ages for injuries to the plaintiff's wife
The Injuries were caused by the overturn-
Ing of a coach owned by Montgomery.
Quarreled and Shot Himself.
OAKLAND, Jan. 12.â Joseph F. Duarte,
an old-time resident of San Leandro, had
a quarrel with his wife this afternoon.
after which he wen* into the back yard
and shot himself In the right temple." His
wife heard the shot and summoned Dr.
Smith, but Duarte's chances of life ar>;
very slim.

GOOD LUCK THE
CAUSE OF DEATH
OAKLAND, Jan. 12.â Mrs. Caroline A. Bigelow died last night of a
shock caused by seeing a sack of gold. This evidence of good luck
after a long spell of misfortune proved too much for her welfare.
The husband, brother and son of Mrs. Bigelow have been engaged In
mining in Nevada for a long time, and they have put into their venture all
the capital they could possibly raise. For a long while they met with
nothing but very ordinary returns, but recently they struck a rich vein,
which guarantees a big fortune.
Mrs. Bigelow was at once informed of their good luck and wm also
told that last night they would arrive home with a sack of the shining
nuggets, of which they had found so many. They kept their word, and
last evening returned and at once displayed to Mrs. Bigelow their wallets
of gold. The sight of the yollow metal and the significance of it proved
too much for the old lady, who had long been subject to heart trouble.
No sooner had 6he taken one look at the gold than she fell back into her
husband's arms and expired immediately. Mrs. Bigelow was 62 years old,
and the cause of the shock was the relief to her anxiety that came with
the discovery of the gold mine.
Her remains will be taken to Nevada and interred near t,he site of the
mine whence the cause of her death was taken.
CITY WATER
CHARGES MAY
BE ILLEGAL
The Bills Are Doubled
for This Year.
THEIR PAYMENT IS REFUSED
BOARD Oi 1 WORKS OBJECTS TO
THE DEMANDS.
The City Attorney Will Probably Be
Instructed to Take the Matter
Into the Courts for
Adjustment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 12.
The Board of Police and Fire Commis
sioners has decided not to pay the bills
of the water companies that have been
presented for the current month and
which are compiled according to the high
est rates permitted in the new schedule.
Their action will probably result in a le
gal investigation as to the validity of the
ordinance under which they are framed.
The difference between the old rate and
the new was shown by the bills of the two
companies. Instead of charging $1 7D per
hydrant $3 50 was charged, and the bill
of the Contra Costa Company was raised
from $343 to $Â»9fi. while the Oakland Com
pany raised from $4 13 to $S 26.
After a little discussion the Commis
sioners passed the following resolution re
ferring the bills to the City Council:
Resolved, That the water bill for the month
of January for water supplied to the Fire De
partment "and for repair of nre hydrants be
and the same are hereby referred to the Coun
cil without recommendation, and for instruc
tion as to whether bills fur supplying water to
the city and Its fire hydrants should be allowed.
pursuant to a resolution of the City Council
purporting to fix water rates for the fiscal year
IS9S-1899.
The effect of this resolution may be that
the Council will authorize the City At
torney to take such steps as may be nec
essary to test the legality of the celebra
ted Henneberry ordinance. It will be re
membered that last year the ordinance
fixing the rates was vetoed by the Mayor,
and that Henneberry's resolution was
rushed through by the 'â¢solid six" at the
last moment. It has been contended that
neither the ordinance nor the resolution
legally fix the rate and that the city can
not be made to pay the high figure now
being charged by the company.
ATTACKED BY FOOTPADS. .
A Miner's Fight to Save His Prop-

OAKLAND, Jan. 12.â Charles Gaffney,

the corner of Thirteenth and Clay streets
to-night. .
Gaffney was unarmed at the time, and
having "several hundred dollars, consid
erable jewelry and diamonds on his per
son he yelled lustily for help. His cries
were heard by Harry Thomas, clerk of
the Board of Public Works and son of
Mayor Thomas, who had left him about
a block from the scene. Thomas ran to
his assistance and attacked one of the
footpads and a lively fight ensued.
In the meantime Gaffney ran to the
Metropole and reported that he had been
held up. The night clerk and day clerk
and several guests armed themselves and
went in search of the robbers, hut the
robbers had made good their escape, for
Thomas was unable to hold the man he
attacked until the police could be sum
moned. The footpads were colored men.
Several recent hold-upa :ire laid to them.

IMPORTANT WITNESS MISSING
Detectives Trying to Collect Links
in the Mentel Case.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 12.â The detecttveÃ
who are securing the evidence against
Mrs. Mentel, charged with the murder of
her husband, have been trying to get
track of a witness who is of vital impor
tance to their case.
Before the Inquest Bruno Steinmetz. a
member of the A>ameda Fire Depart
ment, told a Call reporter of a statement
that had been made to him by a female
acquaintance in San Francisco to the ef
fect that Mrs. Mentel had told her on the
day of the tragedy that she intended to
go to Alameda with her husband and that
she had made up her mind to kill him.
The woman, according to the Steinmetz
story, told him that Mrs. Mentel displayed
the pistol with which she intended to do
the shooting; that she took the weapon
away from ncr and only returned It when
Mrs. Mentel promised not to carry out
her threat.
Steinmetz refused to give the name of
the woman at the time, stating that ha
did not care to get her mixed up in the
case. The Call reporter gave the state
ment to Deputy Coroner Fowler, but no
attention was given it either at the in
quest or at the preliminary examination.
Now the detectives are anxious to locate
the woman, but Steinmetz has had a
complete loss of memory concerning the
matter and will give the officers no clew
to the identity of the woman.
Her testimony would be Important to
show premeditation on the part of Mrs.
Mentel.

DRAINING OF GOLD
LAKE, NEAR SITKA
Immense Body of Water Re=
leased in Order to Secure
Rich Deposits in the
Bottom.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Jan. 9 (via Victoria, B. C, Jan. 12).â The first
Btep in one of the most enterprising mining operations in Alaska
has been taken, and successfully. Gold Lake, in Pande Basin, near
Sitka, was drained through a 300-foot tunnel last Fridays It was a
sight of a lifetime. The Pande Basin Gold Mining Company, organ
ized of San Francisco and New York capital, believing that the bot
tom of this lake was covered with rich gold-bearing gravel and de
composed quartz which had dropped into it from the ledges of the
surrounding mountains, set out more than six months ago to drain it.
The lake lies at a considerable elevation, its natural outlet being a
small creek. One of the leadine: members of the company is ex-Sur
veyor General W. I. Willey of California. Peter Broon, an experi
enced miner, who has been around Juneau ten years,. was made fore
man of the tunnel scheme. The lake is 3000 feet long by 2000 feet
wide and very deep, lying in a valley.
Everybody was driven out of the tunnel when the last blasts were
fired in a narrow wall of rock separating the upper end of the tun
nel from the bottom of the lake. One of the holes did not go off,
and thinking that enough of the rock had been torn away to release
the waters, Broon waited patiently several hours expecting the
break to occur at any moment. A crowd of Sitka spectators were
present. Becoming weary of and impatient at the delay, Broon en
tered the mouth of the tunnel to see what the matter was. In do
ing this he faced death, for the torrent might have swept down in
an instant and carried him away.
Broon found that the charge in the hole, aa he anticipated, had
become damp from seepage. He deliberately took out the shot, re
charged the hole, lighted the fuse and retired down the tunnel. All
this time the crowd stood breathless over his fate. The charge went
off, tore awjy the remaining rock, shattered several feet of glacial
clay, and in a few minutes the barrier broke away before the pres
sure of the water on the other side. There was a rush and hi6s of
a!r, a mighty roar and the water leaped from the mouth of the tun
nel with the force of a dynamite gun. The torrent carried every
thing before it. Huge boulders and rocks as large as houses were
swept down the mountain like so many marbles. Part of the moun
tain side was washed away, leaving a hole yawning as though some
giant Cyclops had taken a bite out of the earth in his rage.
The water fell rapidly, and as the lake was frozen the suction
Boon brought the ice down into the dropping waters with a mighty
crack, roar and splash. It was like the thunder of cannon. The lake
was drained of the immense auantity of water, sixty-one feet deep,
3000 feet long and 2000 feet wide. The torrent plunged down the ra
vine of the creek and spread itself over the ice of another small
lake below. The great weight also broke the ice of this lake with
a second reverberating crash. This lake must be crossed on the trail
from Sitka to Pande Basin. The ice was thrown into such confused
masses that on the return to Sitka the party drawing and riding in
a boat were from 8 o'clock in the evening until 2 o'clock in the
morning going the two miles across. The beach exposed by the
drainage shows gravel and decomposed quartz. Surface prospects
indicate, It is reported, that the ground will go about $35 to the ton,
though this is not corroborated. Foreman Broon came over on the last
steamer. If the ground around the lake pays $3 or 94 to the ton. the
outlook is that the enterprise of the company will be rewarded by
a good thing.
ALASKA'S RICH
PLACER CLAIMS
Gold Bearing Sand and
Gravel Found.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Jan. 9 (via Vic
toria, B. C, Jan. 12).â The latest report
from the Nakwashinsky Bay placer dis
covery, near White Stone Narrows and
Sitka, is that the ground will run about
$47 to the yard of earth. This is in all
probability a wild estimate, but from
all reports there is little doubt that
gold-bearing sand and gravel has been
found and located. It is impossible to
learn the value of the ground till fur
ther work has been done on it in the
spring. The people of Sitka have much
faith in it.
Juneau is somewhat excited over a re
port that became current that placer
ground has been found, within twenty
miles of the city. Gold Creek, which
runs through one side of the town,
yielded about a half million dollars to
; miners some years ago, and this creek
1 now worked out was the start and
' foundation of Juneau. As there are so
â  many quartz ledges around Juneau it
â¢ is thought that this last mysterious
| find may be all right. Parties are now
! understood to be out examining the
ground, though it is not known in what
direction they went.
Captain J. E. Snevely has Just come
out over the ice from Dawson to Ju
neau. He is located in the Eagle City
district on the Yukon. He says there
are 1000 men mining on Seventy Mile
Creek, 2000 on Forty Mile ands^OOO
around Eagle City. He represents a
Sandusky (Ohio) company. This is in
American territory. He says the out
look of all these creeks is very good.
He says also that hardy vegetables are
grown and that oais, shoulder high,
mature in the vicinity of Eagle City.
Up here on the brow of the earth,
where the eternal clouds come tumbling
S down out of the northern lights, in
terest in Atlin and Porcupine over
shadows all other mining camps in
Aluska or British Northwest Territory.
| For example: Thirst for Porcupine
j Creek gravel kept increasing in the
brawny breasts of sixteen men em
ployed in the Big Treadwell mine on
Douglas Island until it became no long
er resistible. Fearing that if they quit
work without due notice their pay
would be withheld until the end of the
month or indefinitely, trie sixteen men
put up a job on the company which
worked to a charm. They knocked
off work the other evening before the
6 o'clock whistle and all were conse-.
quently discharged on the spot. They
went right down and got their time to
date and the next day the sixteen
stro-ng, shrewd and cheerful men came
over to Juneau and took a small steam
er for Haines Mission, which is the
way to go if going to Porcupine or
Atlln. Small steamers are now run
ning from Juneau up the Taku. whence
there is a good winter trail to and
down Pike River to the lake. Soon
another trail will be broken across a
comparatively level country to Discov
ery City on Pine Creek and to Surprise
Lake, where another town has sprung
up and been named Surprise City. The
mining camp in any country which has
not the affix "city" as a part of its bap
tismal name is the exception and not
the rule, and does not run very much
to the pan. The first large party of
the season, headed by Dockie McKin
non and George Miller, left on a Taku
steamer yesterday to go in over the
Taku trail. The party numbered four
teen in all. Fritz Miller, a brother of
George Miller, McKlnnon and two
others, are the discoverers and original
locators of Pine Creek. They took in
several tons of supplies. George Rice
of Juneau is building a big saloon and
hotel at Atlin, and it is nearly com
pleted.
The winter has been unusually mild
in the Atlin region. It has been so open
that it is doubted by those in there that
the lake ever freezes. People have been
going- around in their shirt sleeves.
This statement is made in a letter I
have received dated December 27.
Stragglers are still coming into Atlin
from the Teslin Lake country. They
are in very bad condition. Quite a
number of Indians have arrrVed. They
came all the way from Wrangel up
through the interior. A man named
"Blondy" and a cook named Jack, ar
rived at Atlin late in December by way
of the Brooks trail from the summit of
White Pass. They said they were
thirty-six days on the trail. They took
in SCO pounds of stuff. At Steamboat
Landing, on Taku Arm, the arm is
open for five miles, which makes it bad
for traveling on the ice. Three saw
mills are busy on Atlin Creek. The
logs are usually small, but the lumber
brings $150 a thousand feet.
The stampede to McGee Creek was a
disappointment. Only two or three lo
cations showed any prospect worth
staking.

WAS A USELESS
AND EXPENSIVE
INSTITUTION
Criticism of the Nor
mal School.
NEVER UP TO STANDARD
ITS CERTIFICATES WERE NOT
GENERALLY RECOGNIZED.
Turned Out Teachers in One Year,
When Better Schools Had a
Course of Three
Years.
When the Pan Francisco Board of Edu
cation, careering onward in ita work of
demolition, leveled the city normal
School at a. breath, it ran against a bank
of sentiment. Now, a bank of sentiment
Is often only a bank of vapor that may
be blown away if strongly breathed upon,
but sometimes it resolves Itself Into
something akin to a stubborn fact. The
friends of that institution, which will be
olily a "has been" after February 1, are
moving to avert Its fate and injunction
BuitÃ are clouding the atmosphere. Vir
tual contracts are being charged over by I
these twelve roujrh riders of Directors,
Bay the lawyers who scent the battle afar.
When tli>' city Normal School receives the
High School sweet-girl graduate and
starts hVr up on the steeps of knowledge
the city enters into a sort of contract to
keep her moving until she has completed
. a year and stands at the end of the road
.. with a teacher's certificate or diploma
bound with blue ribbon in her hand. Now,
there are 325 lady students in the Normal :
School, and how can the city keep its j
j'oontract" if th: Institution is no more? \
Moreover, the Normal School, established 'â¢
twenty years ago by John Swett, has
turned out probaly 1800 cultured and able j
teachers for the schools of the State, and ,
. auch a record should stand between it \
and Instant annihilation.
Added to these arguments the girl- ;
pupils of the school are petitioning their
parents and friends for tfie rescue of j
their fostering mother. So, much is raov- i
Ing for tiie salvation of the San Francisco !
Normal School.
The abolition of the institution by the
board last Wednesday evening was the re
sult of a caucus discussion held a few
hours before the session. When the ques
xjmii of retrenchment against the great
'deficit of 1180,361 first struck the young j
board BQuarely In the face the Normal j
School was marked lirst on the list in the
order of going, and the following was the
summing up of delinquencies against it:
The Ban Francisco Normal School Is not
up to the standard and its graduates are
outclassed by the graduates of the three
Btate normal schools. Its deterioration
has i â  f on for ytars, consequently
its use la passed.
Only about half of the counties of the
State will accept a San Francisco Normal
I diploma for a teacher's certificate.
Alameda, the county of schools, colleges
and university, absolutely refuses to con
sider ft San Francisco Normal School
graduate's credentials. This alone, ar
gued ;!:â¢- board last Wednesday, stamps
that Institution as below standard. Then,
too its course is but one-third that re
quired by the State institutions, whose
graduates are accepted everywhere, and
with which the local school board can
never hope to compete.
Tii.- Normal School for some time has
received the closest and tenderest atten
tion of the old board, and by that un
. savory body has been used as a stepping
â  stone to teachers' positions in this city.
Every student entered there was booked
for graduation, and no girl ever failed of
the blue-ribboned diploma. Consequently,
the members of the late Board of Educa- j
tlon and their political friends passed
their candidates along through the two
classes of the school, and at the end of I
the course of bui a single year were a.Â«- j
signed to a city Bchool as teacher, often
â¢â¢" -without a class wherewith to teach. From
this inexhaustible supply came the cloud
":of teachers whose names now swell the
salary list, and helped materially in roll-
Ing up the grea< 1180,381 deficit, plus the
tnt;il of "a large number of extra bills."
the foregoing scathing re
view of the Ban Francisco Normal School
and its connection with the late Hoard of
Education by the present board are state
ments and arguments from friends of
the Bchool. They dispute the alleged as
sertion of the present! board that the in
stitution is an illegal establishment by re
ferring to the fact that its certificates
of Qualification an- accepted by the State.
and that the constitution authorizes the
establishing of normal as well as high
and technical schools. This Normal
School costs the city several thousand
dollars every year. Eight hundred
.dollars comes back to the Nor
mal School fund in fees from students
from without the city at the rate of $60
per year from each pupil. There are two
teachersâ the principal, Miss Fowler, sal
ary (200, and MrÂ«. M. M. Fitzgerald at
$140 per month -who instruct the 120 stu
dents. Miss Fowler graduated in the
same building where she now teaches
thirty-four years ago and has been em
ployed there about twelve years. Mrs.
Fitzgerald is a State Normal School grad
uate and a teacher of many years' ex
perience. In addition to her official duties
us principal Miss Fowler is the regular
.' teacher of one of the classes. The school
'is so arranged that one section or half
of the number of pupils enrolled are al
ways acting as "understudies" or sub
stitute teachers In the city schools in.
â  order to gain experience. This enables
. the two teachers to handle the sixty pu
pils left.
The girl students themselves are speak
ing for the school, holding that by virtue
/ , .of their Hi^'h School diplomas they have
'.been received in the Normal, and such
.reception is a contract, by the terms of
â  which the city agrees to school them for
"â¢'-a year ending June 30, l.xyi*. Attorneys
Highton and Cooney have a petition bear-
Ing the names of a large number of citi
zens protesting against the abolition of
. the school. This protest they attempted
. . to prepen-t to the board at the last meet- i
: lng. but that body refused to go into the
'Â.m erits or demerits of the matter.
To the query why the Normal School
â  'was picked out as a sacrifice the board
answered in no uncertain voice that the
City Normal School is only the begin
ning of the end: that before the work of
retrenchment and reform is ended a num
ber of other schools of the city will fol- |
low it down the road to the deposit of the J
"has b'f-us."
"We are legally advised and are other
wise well prepared," said a Director yes
terday, "for aJI the protests and injunc
tions, and we will go right ahead stick-
Ing to the spirit of the 'act of January 4.
1899.' "
AFTER WHITE'S MONEY.

day brought to light the operations of a j

plainant in the present instance Is Rich

Wife, Minnie Ellert. for a total of $41 77.
The complaint alleges that defendants or
ganized the Unity Merchandise Club early
in the year 1897. There were te be a series
of drawings each week, and after mem
bers' assessments had reached J2-". they
were entitled to a refunding of that
amount, less 10 per cent retained by the
promoters of the scheme. Ihe complain
ant alleges that he and his wife were,
members and paid in the required amount
that would entitle them to a refund, but
they have never been able to force an
accounting. The promoters pf the club
agre_ed to create a reserve fund for the
I by depositing $in a week, but this
was never dune.
AN EXPENSIVE NICKEL.
Delinquent Taxpayers Suffer While j
Special Attorneys Wax Wealthy.
J. B. Davitt. proprietor of several
bakeries In this city, believes that he has
good cause to complain against one of
the laws on the statute books that has
been pronounced "good law" and consti
tutional by the Justices of the Supreme
Court. According to his statement the
statute does work a hardship upon him,
and he sees no way out of the difficulty
but to stand the cost.
In 1897 Mr. Davitt was visited by the
Assessor, to whom he made a statement
Of his property, und a little later he paid
his taxes to the Tax Collector. In that
year the rate of taxation was set by the
Supervisors on the same basis as that
of the preceding year.
Unknown to Mr. Lmvltt the Supervisors (
found, after fixtng the rate, that there
would not be enough money to run the '
city government, and an additional levy j
was rixed. The majority paid the addi
tion, but many did riot, and thereon hangs ;
the tale. The Supervisors secured tho \
services of a special attorney to collect
the delinquent taxes by bringing actions j
in the Justices' courts. Yesterday Mr.
Davitt was served with a summons in- j
forming him of the fact that he had been
sued for the sum of 5 cents and costs.
The costs are the main features, for
with advertising, attorney's fees, County
Clerk's "â fees, etc., the amount now is
something like $12â all for a delinquency
of a half dime. Hundreds of people have
been made to suffer as Mr. Davitt has,
and he is anxious to have the Legislature
amend the law so. as to give those who
are delinquent a chance to square them
selves with the Tax Collector without
paying such high < osts.
LABOR LEGISLATION.
Two Central Trade Organizations
Will Work Together.
The forces- of organized labor in thin
city will be united this year to draft meas
ures favorable to the workingman and
present them, to both Congress and the
State Legislature. The Labor Council is
now stronger than ever, as a number of
unions which hitherto held aloof are now
represented In that body. Last week it
appointed a special legislative committee
and notified the Building Trades Council
of Its action. At the meeting of the lat
ter body, held last night, a committee con
sisting of P. H. McCarthy. Walter Goff
and A. H. Coburn was appointed to work
in conjunction with the committee from
the Labor Council. There are a number
of measures which the union men want
adopted, prominent among them being an
eight-hour law which- will "hold water."
The present eight-hour law is useless, as
the Supreme Court; has decided that if a
man is working -by the hour he can work
as many hours- a day as he chooses, and a
bill will be presented-to remedy this de
fect. Legislation, on prison made goods
will also- be attempted.
.Old. union men say. that in the past labor
has'lost through inot being united: Tills
year all are. standing together, and much
iis hoped, for. ' â¢
NeV. officers will be elected by the Build-
Ing Trades Council next' week. Nomina
tions were' made last nlgh,t as follows:
'President, P. 11. McCarthy, E. L. Mals

LOOKING FOR THIEVES.
Corps of Patrolmen. Parading the
Business District.
Chief Lees has at present a corps of
his most .efficient patrolmen, garbed In
citizen clothes, parading the business
district in search of a gang of sneak
thieves which operated with considerable
success during the holidays and since.
The object of this gang, it is said, was to
get away with as many packages as pos
sible from the wagons of the various ex
press companies.
On one occasion two packages of cigars,
valued, at $30 and $60, were taken from one
of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s wagons, while
the Jones Delivery Agency lost goods
valued at about $75. \fany, other compa
nies suffered and the cases were reported
to the police. As. the detectives, were un
able to round up' the gang it was decided
to send out a corps of patrolmen. It is
their duty to keep an- eye on the various
express wagons, but as 'the thieves are
extremely clever It Is doubtful that the
efforts of the police to jail them will be
successful.
Charged With Forgery.
Michael Broderick. a carpenter living at

"Are you engaged to marry Mrs. Edna Wallace Hooper?"
Tod never flinched, and it may have been the reflection of the brllliant

fact, I must refuse to discuss family. affairs In print," said the jockey """ '

The following statement was given out

THE ENGINES
STOPPED, BUT
NOT THE SHIP
Havoc Played by the
Progreso.
OVERDUE DRUMCRAIG GOT IN
BRITISH STEAMER FASTNET IN
THE SOUTHEASTER.
The Little La Chilena Defied the
Storm â Others of the Weather
beaten Fleet Safely in
Port.
The eteam collier Progreso ran amuck
at Beale-street wharf last night. She
came down from Port Costa after dis
charging and the captain attempted to
dock her at Main-street wharf. Some
thing went wrong in the engine-room,
however, and. Instead of stopping, the big
steamer went full tilt at the ship I. F.
Chapman, moored to Beale-street wharf.
Luckily there was a barge laden with
railroad Iron alongside the Chapman, and
it gave the Progreso a sheer. In conse
quence the ship's headgear only was car
ried away, but had the barge not been
there she would have been cut In two.
Continuing on her way, the Progreso
cut her way for twenty feet into Beale
street wharf and then came to a stop.
The collier dented a number of her plates,
and it will be several days before she
will be ready to go to sea again.
The bar was very rough yesterday after
the storm, but nevertheless a big fleet
came in. The vessel with her maintop
mast gone that was outside Wednesday
night turned out to be the British ship
Drumcraig, 173 days from Swansea. She
was the lirst to come in, the tug Sea
King bringing her through the north
channel. Late in the afternoon she was
followed in by the Henry B. Hyde, the
American ship which kept her company
outside Wednesday night, and after the i
Hyde came the British bark Birkdale (
from Newcastle, N. S. W., American ship
Lucille from Puget Sound, British ship j
British General from Antwerp, the steam- i
er Chilkat from coast ports and five lum
ber schooners.
The subsiding of the gale gave the ves
sels in port a chance, and nearly all of
them that had sails bent had them out |
drying. The gunboat Yorktown was able I
at last to get lier coal aboard, and late in ;
the afternoon sailed for Manila, While â¢
the storm was raging lighters could not j
Ik- alongside of her, but yesterday morn- ]
Ing brignt and early two scows laden with |
roal made fast on each side, and it did |
not take long to lill the warship's bunk- !
ers. The revenue cutter McCulloch spread
her sails, as did also the Drumcraig, and
both took all the advuntage possiole of
the sunshine.
The Drumcraig came here from Ant
j werp via the Cape of Good Hope. She
! encountered fine weather until September j
ti, when she was off the coast of Brazil.
On that day a pampero struck her, and ;
! for three days the crew had a tussle with
I the elements. On September 9 the storm :
moderated, but while the men were set- I
ting the malntopsail the tie carried away !
anu the yard came down with a run,
smashing in two on the deck. Then the
main cap broke and the mainmast head ;
sprung, and Captain Johnson decided to
run for Rio de Janeiro. After a time,
however, as everything seemed to be
working smoothly, the captain changed
his mind and the course of his vessel also.
lie gave up tht? idea of going Into Rio,
stripped the mainmast and started for
San Francisco by way of Good Hope.
All went well on that course until Octo
ber 30, in latitude 43.2'J south longitude 1HÂ»
east, when a very heavy gale from the
west southwest was run into. The port
lifeboat was stove in and other damage
was done. No other accidents or gales
were met with until the ship was oft the
Golden Gate. Then she got a touch of a
southeaster. Captain Johnson was stand-
Ing on the bridge amidships, when a big
sea struck the ship and heeled her over. I
Captain Johnson lost his balance and fell
to the deck below. When picked up he
was unconscious. His face was badly cut
and his back injured. As soon as the ship
docked yesterday morning he came ashore
to consult a doctor about his spine.
Another vessel that caught it off the
coast was the British steamer Fastnet.
She is only a small vessel and the seas
completely buried her at times and swept
everything movable on deck ovfc-board.
She was hove to for thirty hours, and
Captain Moeckler says he was never out
in a worse gale. The Fastnet was built
in England in 1878 and was for years in
the trade between Prince Edward Isl
and Halifax. Then she was purchased by
people in British Columbia and came out
here to go into the Klondike trade. When
the boom burst she was sold to L. A.
Martinez of Guayaquil, who is going to
put her in the Central American trade.
He is now In Portland negotiating for an
other vessel to run in company with the
Fastnet. The steamer will be overhauled
here and will then sail for Guaymus. She
is 338 tons gross and 155 tons net burden,
145.4 feet long, 23.5 feet broad and 11.3 feet
deep.
Captain Moeckler, who brought the Fast
net down, was one of the best knowri
I sealing captains on the coast. Since the ;
loss of the schooner Mattie T. Dyer on
French Frigate Shoals three years ago he
has made his home on the sound and
turned pilot. He will leave the Fast
net here and will go back to Seattle. Be
tween Point Arena and Point Reyes, Cap- i
tain Moeckler says, he saw. tens of thou- !
sands of fur seal, all making for Bering
Sea.
Of all the vessels that were out in the
storm none of them made belter weather ;
of it than the little gasoline schooner La
Chilena. Monday last she was lying at
Fort Ross, and when the gale came up
j Captain Matsen had to cut his mooring
I lines and put to sea. He had to run In !
the teeth of the gale to Bodega, and li. â 
spite o-f the fact that the schooner was
more often under than over the waves,
she made the eighteen miles in three |
hours and came to a sheltered anchor- â 
age. On Tuesday morning it had calmed j
down so that Captain Matsen made an- :
other start, but had not got half wa->- to '
I Point Reyes when it was blowing a living ;
gale. The crew could not see the length
of the vessel for the driving spray, and
the La Chilena weathered the point with-i
her decks under. The schooner acted i
splendidly, and for her inches the skipper '
says there is not a finer sea boat atioat. !
He had to seek shelter again in Drakes |
Bay, from which place he got away again
yesterday morning. A few hours later
the saucy little schooner came speeding I
In over the bar and up the bay as If such";
a thing as a southeaster had never blown.
Sergeant "Tom" Mahoney is down with
the grip, and the passengers by the '
; Tiburon and Sausalito ferries will not see '
i the genial and obliging officer for some
days to come. Chief Wharfinger Perc*
Henderson ie recovering from his attack
and expects to be able to return to his dv- :
ties to-day.
The Shenandoah Is now on Hunters :
Point drydock undergoing an overhauling.
It will be remembered that her cargo of i
coal caught fire when she was lying at
Mission street. It was put out and starts!
again three times, and in consequence the '
lining of the ship was badly burned, it :
will cost many thousands of dollars to â 
make the necessary repairs.
On May 14 the British ship Tamar left â¢
I Vancouver, B. C, for Melbourne, Austra
lia. On July 3 the following note was I
written, put in a bottle and thrown over
board: "British ship Tamar, latitude 9 ,
degrees 41 minutes, longitude 156 degrees
I 29 minutes. All well. Forty-five days out
from Vancouver. H. W. W." Since then
the Tamarhas arrived at Melbourne, from
which port she went to Sydney, N. S. W..
and after loading sailed for London on
| November 19.
The bottle left by Itself was carried by
the current on to Danger Island, where
the natives picked it up on August 16 last.
From Danger Island it was taken to Fan
ning Island and there given to the cap
tain of the schooner Eliza Miller, which
happened to be in port. From Fanning

UNSATISFACTORY BOUTS.
Contest for Alleged Amateur Middle
weight Championship a Farce.
The monthly, exhibition of the San
Francisco Athletic Club did not please the
large crowd which assembled to witness
it. The contest for the alleged amateur
middle-weight championship of the coast
was a fiasco and developed Into a slugging
match.
Tffe contestants -were Gus Koster, San
Francisco Club, and J. J. Cqetro, Wat
sonville Athletic Club. Although sched
uled to weigh 158 pounds the latter tipped
the beam at nearer 170 pounds. An ac
commodating gong saved the member of i
.the home club and gave rise to the re
mark of a spectator that one could not
get a fair deal unless he was a member
of the club. J. J. McDevltt was referee
of this bout.
In the first round Castro landed some
terrific right and left handed blows on
Koster's ribs and head. Koster took the
punishment and landed a vicious blow on
Castro's ear and the latter went to the
floor. The gong saved him at the count
of six. ]n the second round Castro de- !
livered some more kidney blows on Kos
n-r, who got in a. right on Castro's jaw.
and Castro went to the floor just as the
gong sounded. In the third round Castro
landed on Koster's jaw. The latter went
down and the gong sounded at the count
of four, and Koster staggered to his cor
ner. In the fourth Castro landed on KosÂ«
ter's ribs and Koster hit v, astro a blow
on the law, and the latter went down and
out.
In the feather-weight contest between
Eddie Alford of Brooklyn and young Me- j
Donald of the San Francisco Athletic!
Club, the lads went the six rounds, each i
weighing 115 pounds, and Referee Smith
of the Acme Club declared the bout a
draw, although it was the opinion of the
spectators that Alford won on points.
The six-round contest between Kid
Johnson and A. Granneld, both of the San
Francisco Athletic Club, was also de*
clared a draw by Referee Smith. Smith
awarded the contest to John Deane of
the San Francisco Athletic Club in the
latter's six-round bout with Joe Long of
the California Athletic Club. The con
testants weighed 138 pounds and put up
a good fight.
DEATH FROM NEGLECT.
Another Helpless Victim of the
Deadly Baby Farm.
Death came mercifully to little Johnnie
Martin, one of the infants rescued re
cently from Mrs. Susan B. Cunningham's
baby farm at 51 Clara street. The child
died yesterday, and the case was reported
to the Coroner, the physician refusing to
sign the certificate of death.
On December 31 the officers of the So
ciety for the Prevention of . Cruelty to
Children raided the Cunningham place
and found it in a most filthy and disease
breeding condition. Half a dozen infants
were discovered in a semi-starved state,
and the Cunningham woman v.-as said to |
be the worse for liquor. She was directed i
to return the children to their parents or i
guardians at once, and among those sent
home was little John Martin, aged life
years. The mother lived at 217 Grant
avenue and the father, who Is an invalid,
lives anywhere he can find shelter.
Several days ago Officer McMurray
called upon the woman, a complaint hav
ing been made by Officer Reavis, and ;
found the father and child 111, the boy
suffering from the measles and generally
run down in consequence of his previous j
harsh treatment and cruel neglect at the
Cunningham establishment. The mother
had moved to 109 Grant avenue and she
promised to see that the little fellow was
cared for properly. From what the offi
cers and Morgue officials learned little, if.
anything, had been done to relieve thÂ«
baby of its sufferings. Dr. McConnell
stater, that the baby's death appeared to
have been caused by neglect and measles.

Grand Jury Commences Bravely.
The new Grand Jury held its first ses
sion last night- and- commenced work
bravely by finding an Indictment against
! a man whoso trial in the Police Court re-
I suited In an acquittal because hfs guilt
was not proved beyond a reasonable
doubt. During election times George
Young, whom the police claim is a pro
fessional pickpocket, was arrested for
robbing P. J. Thomas, the printer, of $140.
He was caught In the act by Detective*
Egan and Crockett, assisted by Frank
O'Kane, the well-known athlete, who saw
the men struggling and went to the as
sistance of the officers. He took the
money from the man's hand. In addition
to the men who made the arrest the wit
nesses summoned last night were Mr
Thomas. P. J. McCormick and St. John
McCormick. The man Is. out op $300 cash
bail and it is expected he will be arrest
ed to-day.
Abused His Mother.
Mrs. Anne Kennedy, aged 60 years. Hy
ing at 22 Grove street, was assaulted by
her invalid son last night and brutally
beaten. The unfortunate woman was
preparing the evening meal when her oon,
so she claims, attacked her, breaking her
nose and discoloring her left eye. Acting
on the advice of a neighbor she visited
the Receiving Hospital, where her inju
ries were dressed by Dr. Weil.
Bunko Men. Arrested.
Acting under Instructions from Captain
Bohen Detectives Egan and Gibson made
a round-up of bunko men yesterday and
seven were arrested. They were Samuel
Whitney, J. S. Adams, the notorious
"Dink" Wilson, Charles Hawley, John
Miller, Edward Anderson and Nell Nel
son. Each was released on giving: $50 cash
bail.
