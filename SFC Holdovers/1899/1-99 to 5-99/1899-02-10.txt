Aguinaldo Has Some New Sol
diers From the North Who Are
Believed to Be Very Fierce,
NEW YORK, Feb. 9â The Sun Manila cable
says: The Filipino generals, whose forces were
so unmercifully punished by General King's
brigade in the fighting last Sunday, nearly 1000
of them having been killed in the attacks upon
Santa Ana and San Pedro Macate to the south
east of the city, are reported to have fled to the
interior in disguise to escape violence at the
hands of their own people.
The officers in command of the main body
of the insurgents have asked Aguinaldo to send
them re-enforcements, but say they do not want
any more Tagallos. :^r
Reconnoitering parties are finding villages
in every direction flying the white flag, and there
is every indication that the villagers have had
quite enough of the effective warfare waged by
the Americans.
The newly arrived native troops are very ag
gressive and are much in need of such lessons
as was given to their companions in arms last
Sunday.
; MANILA, Feb. 9, 4:40 p.m.
All is quiet here to-day. The
â¢. Filipinos are lying low, except
.on the extreme left and right.
. They are evidently concentrating
.between Caloocan and Malabon.
Judging from appearances the
Filipinos are being reinforced by
; .better drilled men from the north
,: crn provinces. In front of Caloo
can they are as thick as a swarm
of bees.
'.. The American troops feel the
.heat at midday in the open, but
.they are anxious to proceed.
: The soldiers are impatient of re
straint while in - sight of the
.enemy.
.'â¢; The Filipinos are still en
trenching themselves on the left
; of Caloocan.
â¢ â¢ Sergeant Major Smith of the
Tennessees has been ordered to
proceed to the United States by
.'the next transport as an escort of
the remains of Colonel William
G. Smith of the First Tennessee
Volunteers, who died of apoplexy
during the recent battle with the
Filipinos.
5:50 p. m. The natives, fear
ing the Americans were about to
â¢ make an attack or bombard the
town of San Rogue, set fire to
â¢it to-day. It is still burning as
this dispatch is sent, and as it is
â¢ composed in the main of bamboo
huts, it will probably be totally
destroyed.
Telegraph operators are now
worth their weight in gold, and
the members of the signal corps
are working night and day.
AGUINALDO
MUST SUBMIT
NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â The j
The San Francisco Call.
Sun's Manila cable says: Leaders
of the Filipinos, including Aguin
aldo, have taken well to heart the
lesson taught them during the
past four days and are now trying
by diplomacy to end the hostili
ties which they started. Judging
from the latest developments
they have failed as badly as dip
lomats as they did as military
strategists, and it looks as though
their only course is to make com
plete submission to American
authority.
A number of prominent Fili
pinos to-day visited General Otis,
the military commander here, for
the purpose of making overtures
for a settlement of the trouble.
They were received by General
Otis, but his manner was chilling.
The deputation was talkative, and
its members dwelt upon the situ
ation from the Filipino point of
view, but they had absolutely
nothing to offer as a basis of set
tlement. They pressed General
Otis for a declaration of -ome
kind as to what the Filipinos
must concede in order to secure
peace, but his answer dashed their
hopes of obtaining any terms that
would prove beneficial to the
enemy.

Otis said to them, "that I have no

NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â The
Herald's Washington correspon
dent sends the following: . In
terest to-night in the Philippine
situation is centered upon Iloilo,
which is believed to be in posses
sion of General Miller's com
mand.
General Otis cabled to the
War Department- to-day . an
nouncing the dispatch of the
First Tennessee Regiment to
Iloilo to reinforce General Miller,
but it is not certain that it will
arrive at its destination in time to
take part in the attack. *
, It developed to-day that under
the terms of 'â¢instructions ; sent to
General Miller by General Otis.,
the former is to present an ulti
matum to \ the natives directing
that they evacuate the town and.
permit : the landing of American
forces by 9 o'clock on February
10, or it will be 'immediately
bombarded and forcibly- occu
pied. General Miller now has
between 2500 and 3000 men, and
the First Tennessee Regiment
will increase his command by
another thousand. â¢
As the Herald 'stated-' this
morning, it is not expected that
General Miller will find any great
difficulty in occupying the port,
as it is easily approached. Dis
embarkation under the guns of
the naval vessels can be readily
accomplished, and the men-of
war will materially assist the mili
tary in driving the natives out of
the city.

AGUINALDO IS NOT

; CHICAGO, Feb. 9.â Edward C. Andre,
Belgian Consul at Manila, passed

an interview Mr. Andre said he had
been much interested in reading the ac
counts of the battles with Aguinaldo's
forces and he was not surprised they
had been x defeated -so easily by the
American J troops. â¢ The ultimate result
of .the revolution, Ihe said, would be
the formation iof a little | military party
among the Filipinos,- but the greater
part . of the inhabitants â¢ of the islands
would appreciate American . rule all the
more because of Aguinaldo's defeat. In
Mr. Andre's opinion Aguinaldo is not
the real- leader of the insurgents. He
believes the â¢ little rebel is in the hands
of other persons of greater intelligence.

ALAMEDA COUNTY
FEELS VENGEANCE
OF D.M. BURNS
Frank Jordan Shown -That He Has Offended
the Boss.
GIVEN NO CONSIDERATION WHATEVER
Six Members of the Delegation From Across the Bay Act
As Executioners of the Will of the
Man From Mexico,
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 9.â lt is not pleasant for
a county to have its name hawked
through the streets of the capital as
one of the shreds to the Burns Sena
torial tail, but that has been the honor
thrust upon Alameda County and up
held by the Burns members of' its cau
cus last night. Burns had decreed that
whenever worked against him should be
corrected with a heavy hand, and
Frank Jordan, County Clerk of Ala
meda County, is the latest man to flnd
out he meant what he said and some
times could carry it out. Jordan was
in need of some legislation for the bet
ter working of his office, but because
he worked for Grant he gets nothingâ
and Alameda County bears the burden
of a boss' spite. -
Tom Williams gave it all away while
in the company of some friends after
the unfortunate county had been whip
ped into line. He boasted that Burns
could pay in revenge as well as coin-â
that Frank Jordan had worked j for
Grant, and any man who worked for
Grant and wanted anything from his
men could wish for it. It seemed not
to matter that a county of 150,000 peo
ple might object to further the cam-,
paign of. a man they would not' have
anyway, , but their case was in the
hands of their delegation and their dele
gation was in the hands of "Burns.
Last night was the time set for the
officials of Alameda County to appear
before .the' Alameda .delegation with
their . requests arid suggestions for such
legislation as they needed. The offi
cials : came and had a J most j successful
interview. They got all they wanted
and more, tooâ all but Jordan. He had
his time and expense bill for his pains,
for he could get nothing from the dele
gation. .' 'â¢7- : 'xx 27xx' r ~ "â '
It was agreed by the delegation that
nothing short of a two-thirds majority
should bind the delegation, but when
once bound by such a vote it would re
quire unanimous consent to change the
decision. The needs of the officials had
been discussed among the delegates and
some idea of what they needed was
arrived at, but what they wanted was
shown, upon the meeting of the dele
gation, to.be an entirely different mat
terâand what they got as well.
The Sheriff was expected to ask for
an extra deputy; he , told Stratton he
needed but oneâ yet he asked for two
and got them by a vote of 6 to 3. The
Assessor asked for everything he could
possibly need, the Recorder was not
backward, the County Surveyor, the.
Constables, the Justices, Stenographers,
Coronerâ of them got practically all
they wantedâ but Jordan. He got
nothing. It was a great day for Burns
and Alameda. , ... , '- ,
: Every official who came up was hand
ed his package by a vote of 6 to 3 ex
cept the Auditor and i County Clerk.
Stratton, Taylor, and Knowland were
the three. " | Leavitt,* Bliss, McDonald of
Livermore, Kelly, McKeen and the
peerless Mr. Wright were the six. ".â¢
It was so plain that the thing was a
programme that Stratton, chairman of
the delegation, declared he would re
sign and leave them to go ahead in
their unanimity, .' and Taylor and
Knowland were ready to stand by him,
but when the Auditor's offlce came up
for consideration -McKeen broke and
things quieted ; down until Jordan's
claims were considered. Then the
Burns men deliberately betrayed their
county for a bit of personal spite. They
bartered the honor their constituents
had entrusted to them because "no man
could work against Dan Burns and get
anything."* ' '*;:'
Tuesday night when Jordan came up
from Oakland Tom Williams met him
at the depot. Jordan had been in Sac
ramento for some time and had > gone
down to g Oakland f to gather in | those
telegrams,' see that they were properly
sent, and Williams was waiting to tell
him what the Burns - - people * thought
about it. He told Jordan then that he
would get nothing from the 'delegation
and that he would never again get any.
thing from the ' Burns element. Jordan
wanted some relief in the work of regis
trationan extra clerk and extra money
for * copyists. >It â â  was something every
clerk of /Alameda ' County has . wished
for and asked for, and it has grown, to
be a necessity to prevent delay and ex
pense and annoyance to that ';â  county.
He appeared before the delegation after
every one "of the officials had been
lavishly endowed :â¢ with legislative fa
vors and - found the tables turned. - â¢*:
The question came up on the appoint- j
ment of a new deputy j for registration i
in his office. *:i "I " move the request be
denied," said Senator. Leavitt, and by. a
vote ':- it was : ; denied. - The * vote was 5
against and '4 ; in - its", favor, and by ; the
,rule requiring, a two-thirds majority to
bind - the * delegation - his cause "â¢ was lost.
1 9 Stratton J voted ! for. the deputy; he is
a Barnes man; so did Taylor, -a * Bulla
man; and Bliss and McDonald,* both ad- i
herents of Grant. Against it was
Knowland; a Barnes voter, but one who 1
'has ; a â  personal -. feeling against Jordan,
by which he swears he will never vote
'. to help the clerk. â¢*. Then . there â  was
Leavitt, * a Burns man Kelly, a Burns
I man; McKeen, a Burns man, .and
! Burns' latest â  acquisition, - the 'Honor
able (?) Mr. Wright. Ail-, these men
with the- -exception / of '-, Knowland had
voted with , the . six ' who were so gener
ous. r . It was 'no sudden thrill of econo
! my; lit was just that Jordan could get
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
nothing from Burns even if Alameda
wanted it. '" .7
There was no ' necessity for follow
ing up the needs of the County Clerk.
It was plain he had tied up Alameda's
registration for the next two years at
least by daring to antagonize the man
from Mexico, so the unfortunate clerk
let it go at that, and when he came
downtown after the caucus he had the
pleasure of being told, "I told you so."
"He took Burns' money before elec
tion and now he works for Grant," was
Tom Williams' explanation of why Ala
meda County, should be denied decent
registration. It had been argued that
whatever Jordan had received or spent
had no bearing on the necessities of
his office, but - that was a matter the
precious four of the delegation passed
by, although each one of them knew
when he voted that although the club
they wielded was swung over Jordan,
when it struck it was their own county
it hurt. Jordan had been helped by
Tom -Williams before his election, and
while smarting under what he consid
ers the injury Jordan has done him he
does not hesitate to say his assistance
was of the substantial order. Having
forgotten the sunburst through which
the . Hon. Mr. Wright winged his way
| into, the Burns camp, Williams feels
hurt that after his generosity the Coun
ty Clerk should work for Grant. Th*.
| Burns people were rallied and the four
Alamedans betrayed tnelr county for
Burns and did. the master's bidding.
. The thing ' got out and : the Burns
people were jubilant, not because they
had: betrayed a county, but because
Jordan had been fixed..
The matter has not ended with the
characteristic work of the Burns men
in the caucus. It will be fought out
before the Senate on a bill to be intro
duced there to-morrow by Senator
Stratton. He intends to draw up a
measure specially fitted to meet the
case of the luckless Alameda office, and
he and Taylor and Knowland will sup
port it. It will provide that in coun
i ties where the registration is > placed in
charge of the County Clerk the Super
visors shall assist him financially. As
a rule, all measures affecting one coun
ty are left to the delegation from the
county, and the action of a caucus of
the delegation is usually recognized by
the Legislature as final, but . Stratton
is going to keep his bill out of the hands
of the delegation, or at least the Burns
men in.it, for only from the outside
can Alameda hope to escape the wrath
of the beaten Burns.
, The most interesting part of the
caucus of the Alameda delegation was
not the session in the Capitol; it was
a session . downtown impromptu, brief
and characteristic, and due to a sudden
accession of virtue on the part of Mc-
Keen and his desire to return to the
majority fold. McKeen was one of the
six in the delegation, and he was proud
to be with such company as Leavitt
and Kelley and the Hon. Mr. .Wright.
He voted as they did until it came to
a question of the Auditor's office, and
then it was McKeen made his unlucky
and unwitting step toward virtue. He
was sorry he did it fifteen or twenty
minutes â after, and that -was what
caused the interest.
Cal Ewing, Alameda's Auditor,
wanted two deputies and a fat addi
tional sum for expenses. He asked for
it from the delegation and there was
at once an earnest objection from Tay
lor and Stratton and Knowland, the
minority. Stratton declared that he
knew for a fact that Ewing only needed
one additional deputy and. he was op
posed to giving him any more. But
the six were in evidence and it ap
peared useless to argue until McKeen
showed some symptoms of reform. He
said he did not know about that extra
deputy, and when the vote came round
to him he voted "No.".
â¢ It was sto 4. It required six to bind
the caucus. ' The chairman declared
the motion lost and Ewing lost his dep
uty throufh the virtuous perfidy of As
semblyman McKeen. After, the caucus
adjourned the majority with Ewing and
a few others sought a place, where they
could talk it - over, and when Stratton
came upon â¢ them in the Golden Eagle
he found Ewing jubilant.
* "I have all I wan!," Ewing declared.
"I was treated -well," and he ordered
another bottle. .; .
"You seerp happy for ft man who has
only, half what he asked," said Strat
ton. :"':., ,'
"No, I got all Tasked for," declared
Ewing. "I asked for two deputies" â 
"And you were given one," inter
rupted Stratton.
"No, two."
. "No, one."
-. "I tell you it' two," insisted Ewing,
and the - sturdy majority crowded
around and said: "Yes, he got two."
Stratton was not to be bluffed. "He
was given but one deputy," declared he,
"and my notes show it. Your notes
show It, t too, Mr. Wright, and so do
yours," -turning to Kelley, who had
acted as secretary of the caucus. The
Hon. Mr. Wright gave it as , his
recollection that the vote had â  given
Ewing two 7; deputies, McKeen having
voted <in â '* favor ;of -'â  it, and with . such
backing McKeen swore he had voted to
give his friend Ewing all the deputies
he wanted and had never thought to
vote otherwise. * Stratton "was -firm,
however, and exhibited his notes.' They
showed that McKeen had voted "No,"
making five to four, and under the rule
of the caucus the vote to allow Ewing
a second extra deputy was lost.
. Then he called- for/the notes of the
secretary, r and after some * hesitation
they were produced and again they
showed the motion lost and the un
fortunate McKeen '.' had , found himself
for once with the virtuous. Then the

OLD WORKERS GETTING DISGRUNTLED.
>
Collector of the Port Jackson Sheds the Light of His
Experience on the Situation and Announces His .
Intention to Break the Deadlock,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- .
MENTO, Feb. 9.â The story comes from I
the inside of the Burns corral that Ma
.jor.Frank McLaughlin, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee, is
â¢the chief manager of the colonel's cam
'.pai'g'n, and that all orders emanate from
.'him. The major's supremacy as man
ager is not relished by several of the
'workers who have been here recently.
.One .worker who took his departure this
' Week, said before going away:
* "There is no -sense In my staying
around. When I got here Frank opened
a -bottle of wine and I have not been
â asked to say two words to him since."
.-â¢ Commenting on the departure of this
â¢ worker, another friend of the colonel
who is here to-night remarked:
'.".This' man who went away feeling
that he could be of no use while Frank
was managing affairs is one of the best
'7 workers in the Slate, and is so recog
â¢ nized by the raiiroad. He knows how
a campaign of this kind should be con
ducted and he has had ample experi
ence. He could teach Frank, but he is
not" even invited to make a sugges
tion."
From other inside sources the infor
mation comes that there is discord in
the camp of the colonel. The touts are
swarming around here, but there seems
' to be an absence of method and system
in the work laid out for them.
The story that Herrin has cold feet is
- denied by the insiders of the corral.
â¢ The latest information from the yellow
building comes in the form of positive
assurance that Herrin will stand by the
"Colonel" as long as {he latter believes
that there is any hope of success, arid
' will stay longer if Dan desires further
proof of loyalty. â¢ "-*.-'., '
It is surprising to old-time politicians
that Burns has made such a poor show
. ing in this fight. They consider that
he has had behind him the regularly
organized machine of the Republican
. party; that he has the powerful back
â¢ ing of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, the assistance of Phil Crim
mins and Martin Kelly, the backing of
Mose Gunst and his gambling influence,
the prestige of the State patronage and
"the friendship of the Governor, and
â¢'. yet with all these elements of strength
" he is not able to muster more than
.- twenty-six votes.
'.' ' A. shrewd and successful campaigner,
a" veteran of several Senatorial con-'
tests, remarked to-night: "In times
past we would have considered the rail
road support or .the support of the
party organization as sufficient back
ing to win a fight, but Burns, with
"these elements in his favor and many
â¢ more, makes no progress. It must be
bad management of his fight a man
agement that excites antagonism."
' â¢ Colonel J. P. Jackson, Collector of the
Port of San Francisco, who arrived on
the scene last night, is telling mem
bers and candidates for United States
' Senator that he is here to break the
'.deadlock. He has not openly an
nounced his preference for any partic
ular candidate, but it is an open secret
that he is here to help Grant out of
ah. ugly and scandalous situation by
â¢ an endeavor to elect him to the offlce
.of United States Senator. Colonel Jack
â¢ Bon has peculiar ideas concerning
â¢caucus government. He has a notion
that forty-three members, which com
prise a majority of the eighty-five Re
publicans of the Legislature, may get
-together in caucus, and if twenty-two,
' a majority of the forty-three, agree on
...a* candidate for â  Senator, that the
.*. eighty-five Republicans will be bound
' by the decree of the caucus to support
â¢the nominee.
*.â .'. He argues that if a majority of the
â¢Republicans of the Legislature goes
.'.into caucus the minority is required by
.â¢ party custom to abide by the will of
'.-the majority. He asserts that the
'.question was submitted two years ago !
â¢to high authority on party govern- ]
ment, and the decision was that the
members belonging the the minority,
â¢.whether they participated In the caucus
or not, were bound by party usage to
accept the caucus decree.
There is not the slightest danger that \
the Grant men, the Bulla men or the |
"supporters of General Barnes will give I
â¢ serious consideration to Colonel Jack
son's notion of a caucus. This con
test will be fought in the open light of
" day until Grant and Burns retire. When '
they get out of the way a Senator can j
be elected. : : ' .*.â â .->. *â %.:

will be no marked change in the situa
tion before Tuesday next. The belief
grows stronger every hour that neither
Burns nor Grant can win out. A few
of the touts still reiterate the declara
tion that the fight will end in the elec
tion of Burns or nobody. It is a settled
conviction In the minds of nine-tenths
of the members of the Legislature that
the deadlock cannot be. broken until
both Burns and Grant are eliminated

Colonel Jackson passed the hours of
daylight in extending warm greetings
to the various Senatorial aspirants and
making appointments to meet each one
of them at a later hour in the day. He
met Senator Bulla in the Senate cham
ber and made himself agreeable to
General Barnes at the Golden Eagle
Hotel. Mr. Grant observed the cor

the general and never shed a tear.
PROF. HERRMANN GROVE JOHNSON IN HIS MARVELOUS SLEIGHT OF HAND PERFORMANCES
Colonel Jackson and Milton Green were
boon companions in the Perkins cam- j
paign two years ago, hence it is not I
strange that much of the colonel's time j
is passed in the room of Mr. Green.
The Alameda telegrams, which were
programmed to excite a Grant boom
have fallen as flat as fell the mercan
tile Indorsement which Mose Gunst pro
cured for Dan Burns in San Francisco.
In each case the Call's prompt exposure
knocked out the vitality of the scheme.
The touts are here In force again, and
may rally for one more big bluff, but
positive Information from the inside of
the Burns corral is to the effect that
the "colonel" â¢ does not expect to win.
The best that he can do is to defeat the
election of any Senator. This decision,
if carried out, would not bring Senator
Perkins to grief. Perkins would be well
pleased to have as a colleague a weak
ling like Mr. Grant of San Diego, but
he would "view. with alarm" the elec
tion of some man of robust and vital
energy. No Senator would suit Perkins
to a dot.
Should the Legislature adjourn with
out electing a Senator to succeed
Stephen M. White a great pressure may
I be exerted to induce Governor Gage to
call an extra session on the single ques
-1 tion of the Senatorial vacancy. Already
: there is talk of such a plan. In the dis
! cussion of the matter it is said that
j public opinion, backed by the influence
jof the Republican party organization,
' would compel members to come to an
1 agreement. When thit subject was pre
sented to Governor -Gage this evening
! he manifested no inclination to express
! his views thereon. His friends enter-
I tain the opinion that he never will yield
|to extra session pressure. ' .
; He may deem it advisable to consult
I several of the leaders in each house and
j endeavor to facilitate action on the gen
, eral appropriation bill for the mainte
' nance of the State Government. With
the tax levy bill and the general budget
passed the Legislature could adjourn
I without detriment to the public inter
; est. The Governor, so* far as known,
j has expressed no views on this subject,
I but his general declaration in favor of
| retrenchment in the conduct of State
affairs leads his friends to the conclu
! sion that he would do everything with
! in -the scope . of ; executive privilege to
j avoid the necessity for an extra ses
! sion of the Legislature. 'â .**.

COLONEL JACKSON
â¢ UNFOLDS BIS PLAN
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- i
MENTO, Feb. Late to-night Colonel
J. P. Jackson's plan for breaking the
deadlock was unfolded. In brief he
proposes to consolidate all the elements
of opposition to the candidacy of Dan
Burns. He would call a convention of
the legislators who are voting for
Grant,' 1 Barnes, Bulla, Scott. Bard. Fel
ton and Estee. The numerical strength
of these scattered forces is fifty-eight.
Th,e colonel would have all of them
meet in convention and ballot openly
for United States Senator. If no one
receives a majority of the fifty-eight
on the first show down then the lowest
candidate is to be dropped. The pro
cess of dropping the lowest candidate
is to be continued until one man re
ceives the entire vote. The fifty-eight
Republicans, with the aid of three
Democrats may then elect a Senator.
There is a good deal of merriment in
the camps of Bulla and Barnes over the
unfolding of Jackson's method of
breaking the deadlock by inviting all
the opponents of Colonel Burns to vote
for Grant. In the Burns camp there,
is a "ha ha" !at the expense of the
Collector and his caucus scheme.
There was an alarm in the Burns cor
ral to-day. Howard Wright was not
present and Dan was shy a vote. Jake
Steppacher was in a great state of trep
idation and blamed Dibble for the
blunder or mishap. Dibble replied that
he was too busy to look after Wright,
and then Jake suggested that the ex-
Speaker should be permanently paired
to avoid a repetition of the disaster.
SENATE BUSINESS TENDS
TOWARD NIGHT SESSIONS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. The need of night ses
sions in the Senate is becoming apparent
to the members of that body, and the first
step toward burning the legislative mid
i night oil was taken by Senator Smith
I this morning. He submitted a resolution
! providing sessions of the Senate to
j commence at 10 a. in., 2 p. m. and. 8 p. m.
It was referred to the Committee on
Rules. . Â;.* ,
Assemblyman Cobb's bill. to provide for
the registration of master and journey
men horseshoers and a board of examin
ers to Insure their competency, brought
Senator Cutter to his feet, for he had
found a bug. He wanted to amend the
hill by striking out that clause making
the act apply to counties of 35,000 Inhabi
tants or over only. -.*..-â¢
He represented two of the counties
which were not up to the limit, he said.
and should the bill pass the effect would
be to drive all horseshoers who failed to
pass the board of examiners in the larger
counties to the smaller ones, where no
such disability would- exist under ' the
"bug." Cutter thought the law should
be made general if it were passed at all.
Taylor declared that the bill .would not
pass the Assembly again as amended, and
Senator Smith submitted: two amend
ments, one of which made It impossible
to establish a newspaper in any town un
less by consent of the editor already run
ning papers there, and' another of a
smillar nature, both of which were barred
for levity. He said he wanted to get. rid
of such. legislation. . The amendment fin
ally went through and the bill was passed
for third reading.
The bill introduced In the Assembly to
provide $11,000 for : the furnishing of the
office of the clerk of the Supreme Court
was met by an amendment from Senator
Davis, cutting down the appropriation to
$7500. ' The Senate declined, to stand for
the reduction, and the bill passed. '
Warden's Assembly bill No. : 121 to, re
quire pilots and pilot commissions to
keep certain records, which it was shown
they already keep, was gravely passed by

FROM BLOOD TO
GOOD BLACK INK
Senator Morehouse Changes From
Gore in General to a Speci
fied, Individual Fluid.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 9.â Senator Morehouse has
closed his arsenal, spiked his guns and
emptied his cartridge belt. He no longer
thirsts for editorial blood, but he ls still
stalking newspaper criticism.
He wants the names of the writers. He
demands that every article published
which "tends to blacken the memory" of
any one dead or "Impeach the honesty or
Integrity" of any one living, shall be sup
plemented by the name of the one ,who !
writes it. The bill Is a substitute for the
one which makes it a pastime to kill the
men of pen and pencil, or makes It only
necessary to have soap and a towel handy
to get rid of the only stain his former bill
would recognize. It is the result of the
discussion before the Judiciary Commit
tee of the Senate of a few days -ago, in
which much of the pent-up bitterness of
the senior Senator from Santa Clara took
the form of a speech. His speech was a
well-worded and interesting denunciation
of a law which closes the muzzles of law
less pistols, and against the men who
write on personalities, and having deliv
ered it he felt better, and not so vicious,
and, taking up a suggestion from Senator
Davis, he demanded .names in his next
bill. '-â¢'â¢ ' -
As it is now, both bills. are before the
Senate, and should the murderous one be
allowed to go before the Senate as well
as its running mate, there will be a double
dance upon the wishbone of the prostrate
journalist, for if there is aythlng a leg
islator dearly loves It is to follow in the
footsteps of the eloquent and erratic Sen
ator Simpson, of Pasadena, to deliver an
impassioned speech in one direction and
then vote In the otherâ to have a good go
at the press, and then kill the bills.
Senator Morehouse's latest Idea in ed
itorial legislation is as follows :
An act to add a new section to the Penal Code
* of the State of California, to be known as
section 258, relating to libel. :
The people of the State of California, repre
sented in the Senate and Assembly, do enact
as follows:. 'oj -â¢''
.Section 1. There Is hereby added to the
Penal Code of the State of California a new
section, to be known as section 258, to read as
. follows: ""â¢â¢'â 
Section 258. Every article, statement or edi
torial contained in any newspaper or other
printed publication, printed or published in
this State, which by writing: or printing tends
to blacken the memory of one who is dead, or
to Impeach the honesty, integrity, virtue or
reputation, or publish the natural or alleged
defects of one who Ib alive, and thereby ex
pose him or her to public hatred, -contempt or
ridicule, . must be supplemented by the true,
name of the writer of such article.- statement
'or editorial, signed or .-printed at ' the end
thereof. Any owner, proprietor or publisher of
any newspaper or other printed publication
printed or published in this State who shall
publish any such article, statement or edi
torial in â¢ any printed , publication, printed or
published In this State, which is. not So sup
plemented by the true name of > the writer

as , required, by ; this - section, shall forfeit the
sum of $1000 for each and every article, state
ment or editorial lso published in violation of
â  the requirements of 'this section,-'.: which, said
sum so forfeited may be sued for and recovered
against, any such owner." publisher or proprietor
so; violating this section, ln a, civil action by
and in the name of any person who may bring
action therefor, one-half of the recovery to be
paid into the treasury of this State by the
plaintiff and the other half to be retained by
the plaintiff in such action.
If : in any such action it shall appear by
affidavit to the satisfaction of the court where
such action is commenced that a defendant has
made a publication in violation of this section
within this State, and that after due diligence
such defendant cannot be found within this
State, â¢or. Is a . foreign corporation, the court
must direct an attachment in such action to
issue against the property of such defendant
and thereupon such attachment shall issue and
be- executed as in other cases where by law
an attachment is provided for.
Sec. 2. This action shall take effect thirty
-Java from and alter its passage.
Senator Morehouse says that notwith
standing his desire to wallow in the blood
of offending newspaper men he will offer
an amendment to the cartoon bill which j
will provide that ! cartoons may be pub- J
lished if they be not drawn with malice |
prepense and a desire to injure or distress
the subject. Morehouse will also mitigate !
to a great extent the severity of the pres
ent bill. His amendment will provide
that jit shall simply be unlawful - for a
publisher to insert displeasing pictures,
and it will devolve upon the complainant
to prove his case rather than upon the de
fendant to disprove It.
DOUBT IN REGARD TO
SCHOOL TAXATION
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 9.â Doubt seems to exist in
the minds of the members of the Assem
bly Judiciary Committee In regard to the
taxation of school property. Constitutional
amendments 2, 7 and 14, which all relate
to the subject of school property taxa
tion, were reported back to the Assembly
without recommendation by the commit
tee this evening. J Representatives from
Stanford University appeared before the
committee and spoke in favor of amend
ment 2, which relates directly to the
Stanford University. The object of the
amendment is to exempt all the property
which is connected directly to the college
from taxation and in consideration . of
which the university is willing to allow
residents of this State tuition free of
charge. The other amendments are of a
like nature In regard to schools In th*-
southern part of the State, with the ex
ception of the free tuition. When the
matter comes up in the Assembly, as it
will in the near future, considerable dis
cussion will follow.
The bill relating lo admlnstratlons were
all put over until Monday evening, which
is the next meeting night of the commit
tee.
The bill putting a tax upon bicyclists
was referred to a special committee com-
pared of Works and Cowan to test the
constitutionality of the act. The money
derived from the tax is to be devoted to
the making of a path for the use of pe
destrians and wheelmen along country

WAXED ELOQUENT OVER ?
THE INHERITANCE TAX
CALL ' HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 9.â Whether or not. to tax
the inheritance of an absent brother or
sister was a subject over which: more
than, one Senator. waxed, eloquent to-day.
Senator Braunhart's Senate bill No. 5 was
the cause of It all, land an amendment
Placing back In the bill something the Ju
diciary Committee had already stricken ,
out was the direct occasion of all the ora
tory \ before it was defeated. - \ ,
To place back in the bill a clause ex
empting the inheritance of . absent broth
ers and sisters would be to reverse them
selves, declared Senator Bulla, and Sen
ator Davis then took up the cudgel and j
explained how ; the amendment refused to
stay dead after the committee had hit |
it with a club. Bulla, with the habitual
gallantry of the South, could see the , wis
dom and the justice in allowing sisters to
inherit without the supervision of the tax
collector, but: he thought brothers j could
and should shift for themselves. ,
Senator Curtin,: who generally- likes to
delve deep Into the legal aspect of things,
tried a touch of sentiment which won a
nod of Senatorial approval from Bulla.
Curtin could see no reason why the lit
tle nieces and nephews of the deceased,
possibly and probably minors, shouia be
assessed -for their inheritance wnne tne
brothers and sisters: generally adults,
should be allowed to Innerlt free of
charge. Smith of Bakersfleld admitted
the existence of. a brother whom he had
not, seen for twenty years, and while the
tie that still bound them was a strong ,
one, â¢â¢ still he 'was 1 willing his ' brother
should pay; a tax on any little testamen- .
tary courtesies the Senator might bestow
upon him.
Davis found authority for his position
in that section of the code which declares
blood to be thicker than water, and he
tried to* show, upon his sanguinary the
ory, that under the amendment the moun
tain mining, pioneer from Amador would
derive a great deal of post mortem bene
fit. He declared it would protect from
depletion the little gold the hills of Ama
dor had grudgingly yielded the man of '49,
and how after he had joined his fathers
the non-mining brother of the East, who
may have made his pile ln railroads or
canning army beef, could come in and
receive the small though golden store,
without lifting the State treasury a hair's
breadth.
Senator Sims favored brothers and sis
ters, and then Bulla arose to call atten
tion to the fact that while Senator Da
vis had spoken feelingly of the big tax
to be deducted from ithe big estate while
referring at the same time to the little
estate, he failed to mention that the tax
on the little estate would amount to only
a very small amount. He called atten
tion to the fact that the fees in each
_ase were relatively the same for big and
little, and he ventured an assertion that
some Senators then voting to take off
the tax would oppose a proposition to
reduce the fees. â '''..'
Davis declared this unfair criticism, and
Bulla made a point of order that Davis
nad already consumed the amount of ora
tory the Senate allows, and besides he
meant nothing, anyway â a statement
which mollified the Senator from Amador.
Braunhart arose to add to the swirl of
words which had his bit of legislation
for a center, but he only said his amend
ment was all right and it ought to be
voted for. It was, too, to some extent,
for there were 14 votes for the clause. It
was beaten by 3. and therefore a quasi
fraternal donation will be exacted from
prospective heirs who remain from the'
State while local brothers and sisters are
Hearing their end.
Another amendment, submitted by Sen
ator Wolfe, making the bill relate to es
tates at present in probate as well as
those to be probated, met with more fa
vor. The bill will come up for final pas
sage to-morrow. â¢ â 
There was a fight over the clause re
lating to nephews and nieces last session
in the Legislature, and by Its adoption the
State lost over $250,000 in taxes on the
Stanford estate. The exemption of the
nieces and nephews was cut out by the
amendment and was extended to make
liable also brothers and sisters. This
means another big saving in several of
the big estates. -*'-'"'â¢â

to show them. It was unfortunate in
view of the one-time Speaker's asser
tion that he recollected the vote and it
stood 6 to 3 in favor, with McKeen in
the six. His notes showed McKeen in
the four and the motion was lost.
The wine grew flat in the glasses
while the bluff of the reduced majority
dried up and blew away, in dust. It
was plain it was a bold attempt to get
an extra deputy for Ewing anyhow,
trusting the chairman 'would forget
how the vote went and allow McKeen

a bad mistake, but the chairman would
not stand for a back-down and McKeen
had to stay good.

mity of Daiton and it is expected that

has been fulsome and persistent in
singing the Senator's praises, will now

official Alameda estimation for the way
Jordan was treated, not through sym
pathy for Jordan, but through fear of
similar treatment, and the whole situa
tion may be said to have been strained.
COUNTY CLERK JORDAN
MAY YET GET HELP
Oakland Oflice San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 9.
County Clerk Jordan was before the
Grand Jury to-day, testifying in regard
to the . additional help needed in his of
fice to get out the great register.
The Alameda delegation last night at
Sacramento, in caucus, declined to give
Mr. Jordan any help, and the Grand Jury
will probably attempt to induce the dele
gation to reconsider its decision. Mr. Jor
dan to-day made the following statement
of the situation as viewed from his stand
point: .;*"....â¢;'â : /â ';â .:â '-:;_ ;: V. s-'-UJ-:*-.-'.
I appeared before the Alameda delegation in
Sacramento last night and asked for one regis
tration deputy and for the year 1900 $3000 foi
extra help, making the*, cost of â  registration dur
ing the next four years $12,000. In the four
years prior to 1595, the flrst year of my first
term of office, the county paid about $18,000. As
every one knows in this county during my flrst
term through an accident of legislation I was
compelled to do the work at an expense of
several thousand dollars to myself. â¢ The allow
ance for general duties of my office was "only
sufficient to attend to such duties properly.
Under the new registration law about 30,000
men will have to make duplicate affidavits, or
60,000 affidavits in all. How is this to
be done without extra help?
Can any reasonable man say that out of my
salary of $4000 I have to pay for this? The
situation Is just this: The people of this
county and the city and county committees of
the political parties should take warning and
act at once in order to prevent thousands of
men from being disfranchised. I don't care
how the delegation provides for assistance. * for
provide they will have to, or else the voters of
this county will remember it to their sorrow.
The allowance of extra assistance does not help
me a cent's worth. They can either give me
the patronage, as I propose to throw the au
thority upon the Board of Supervisors, only if
it goes there, as It rested before 1895, it
will cost the county for the same period, as
embraced in my proposition, $8000 more. â¢ I
think those members of tne delegation who
voted against the proposition when they think
the matter over will arrive at the conclusion
to consider the wishes of the voters instead of
vengeful politicians.
All the county officials have been sub
poenaed 'to appear before the Grand Jury
and enlighten that body regarding the
help required In their departments.MILES IS

What He Wanted at
This Time.
Eagan Yet in Danger of Court-
Martial and Dismissal
From Service.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: When I saw General Miles this afternoon he told
me he had been Informed of the purpose of the President to make
a complete investigation of the allegations made by him respecting
the character of the beef furnished the army during the war.
General Miles feels that there can be but one conclusion â that
the court will flnd, notwithstanding the conclusion of the War Inves
tigation Commission, that the statements of thousands of soldiers
that the beef and canned meat supplied to the army was unfit for use
and that frozen beef was embalmed are correct.
General Miles will not be represented by counsel, but he may
deem it advisable to seek legal advice as to the course he should pur
sue. In any event it is his purpose to aid the court in every way in
getting at all the facts, and in reaching a conclusion which will be
honorable and just. t v
"In appointing a court," he said to me, "the authorities have taken
the proper judicial course. I had intended to advise such action as
soon as I had received all the reports from the troops who served
in Porto Rico and Cuba. All but five of the regiments have been
heard from. One report from the Ninth Infantry was received, but
the inclosures were missing, and as it was important to obtain them
it was returned with Instructions to forward copies at least of the
missing documents. The reports represent a total of 22,000 men."
It is because of the necessity of giving the court such facts as
he may have that General Eagan will remain in Washington. An
officer of the army with whom I talked said that though General
Eagan is now under suspension, should the court find him responsible
for supplying the army with bad beef he can be court-martialed
again and dismissed from the service. .:

COMMISSION
ATTACKS THE
MILITIAMEN
Apparently Only the Volun
teer Is to Suffer by the
Late War Investigation.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â The report
of the War Investigation Commission
is in the hands of the President, and
the commission is dissolved. All of the
members of the commission, including
the secretary, Mr. Weightman, and the*
recorder, Colonel Davis, met by ap
pointment at the White House at 4:15
o'clock this afternoon and were at once
shown into the Cabinet room, where
they were received by the President.
General Dodge, the chairman of ' the
commission, presented the report, and
in receiving it the 'President congratu
lated the Commissioners on the com
pletion of their task.
Seated around the Cabinet table, the
members went over their work in a
general way, and at the request of the
President read portions of their report
which covered certain points in which
he had expressed an interest. The con
ference lasted about an hour and a
half, and as the Commissioners were
about to leave the President" stated
that he was satisfied that each member
had done his whole duty. He himself
had rendered them every assistance
possible, and said they could bear wit
ness that he had not sought to influence
them in any manner or in the slightest
degree. .
In speaking of the report to-day a
I prominent member of the commission
j said:
The report does not whitewash. It
criticizes, but not persons or things not
warranted by the evidence before us. We
started out. with the assumption that the
conduct of the war was all right and
then we went ahead to hear and call-wit
nesses who said it was not. The report
represents the honest opinion of every
member of the commission. We were
unanimous in adopting it. 1 say this and
I am of the opposite political faith and
don't expect and don't want anything
from the Administration.
I know that every line of the report rep
! resents my individual view and if any
* member tried harder than I did to get at
j and out all the facts 1 have yet to see
; him. There was no suppression or con-
I cealment and no point brought out in the
i evidence was evaded or glossed over. We
! never met before hearing a witness and
j agreed not to examine him or to touch
upon certain matters that might turn out
unfavorably. Everything that a man
l knew or thought he knew was the subject
I of inquiry, and I am satisfied, when the
! country gets our report in full, that there
I will be no complaint either as to our
i methods or results.
The President never saw a line of our
report before he received it officially; not
a single word. Nor, indeed, -has he ever
talked with any of the commission
about It.
He has never in any way, by: word or
action or messenger, evidenced a wish to
have us develop anything but the truth
or even touched upon the matter of our
work.
We have questioned more than 500 wit
nesses and the majority of them had some
complaint that. they wanted to relate. In
no instance can it be proved that we have
omitted to call any witness who has been
brought to our attention as having Im
portant facts to disclose. But had we de
. sired to "whitewash", the administration
jwe could have had" 5000 witnesses who j
could truthfully testify that the conduct \
1 of the war was all right.
Of course, there were some evils, but
i they were to be expected. The soldiers
I in the Civil War never had hospitals or
! medical attendance as good as was given
â  them In the war A with : Spain. And their
army ration then was not as; eatable as [
It is" now. The men who complained the
j most of the food we found very generally
' the militiamen from the interiors of
States and who had been allowed "*2 per
head for subsistence >- stores while they
were in State camps. When they went
] into the active fighting. they expected the
same sort of thing. . -X,' â 
In questioning these men nearly all con
fessed to us that .they had always re-
I ceived the army ration. They had no
right to expect any more. There .were
I many complaints brought to us that on
j their face were foolish and false, but we
went to every trouble and expense to In
quire into every genuine charge.

FOREIGNERS IN CHINA
Placed in Deadly Peril by the Success of the
Rebels Who Hope to Expel the
Present Dynasty.
TACOMA, Feb. 9.â The steamer Empress of Japan brings news that several Catholic priests and over 1000
native Christians have reached Ichang from Chang Yang and Lichuan, where their chapels were burned down
and the houses of native Christians attacked and destroyed. The perpetrators of these outrages carry the flag
of the arch rebel, Yumanfze. Their flag bears the following Inscription: â -"'.,,â >â".-!â  7x.y,7..
"Destroy* all foreigners and advance the Tsing dynasty." * -V"
In both Szechuen and Shansi provinces the Yumantze rebels have offered a reward of 120 taels for the head
of every male foreigner \ho is killed and 100 taels for every woman or child. This offer has created the great
est enthusiasm among the rebels, who declare they will kill every foreigner they find. This puts the mis
sionaries throughout Central China In the greatest danger, -V. > V.*V~" â '-;-. 'â -'-' -.. : â¢ .'
At Changlo a native Christian has been killed. '- Even Ichang has been threatened, though that city is
rendered safe by the presence of the British gunboat Esk. â  . â  '."â¢'"**!-:'." '.."
Great excitement prevails among the people over the influx of Christian refugees, and a guard of soldiers
has been stationed about the Roman Catholic premises. It is reported that a native gunboat has been dis
patched to Ichang, and that the Viceroy has ordered several hundred soldiers to procr-**-*' to the scene of the
anti-Christian disturbances. The Viceroy has issued a proclamation declaring that Christians also have good
parents and must therefore be protected and properly treated. -;.;-!
Popular opinion throughout Shansi and Szechuen attributes these troubles to the Kolao Hui, a secret society
which is endeavoring to stir up all China against foreigners. This society has grown very powerful during the
past year, its members claiming that it numbers one-third of China's population. Its members are no longer
ashamed to publicly own that they belong to the society. One Kolao Hui leader had several thousand men ready
to march to Peking or anywhere else where they might drive out foreigners. He asked She magistrate of San
yuan to lead them at once against the foreigners in that vicinity. The magistrate replied by clapping him into
prison with his chief aids. 77y*M7?7: i; " x:X-x7-
There are indications that the Kolao Hui intends to follow Yumantze's example by turning into banditti.
One of their leaders claims that within a year. they will be ruling China and will have every foreigner expelled.

ing protection from the Viceroys and Governors, ir

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Feb. 9.â Mail
advices to hand by the Empress of
China, which arrived from the Orient
yesterday, tell of the terrible experience
I cf Mrs. Peter Rijnhart, the well-known
! Canadian medical missionary, in the
j interior of Thibet.
She arrived at Tachienlu, China, on
the 26th of November last in a dying
condition, being almost, worn to a
shadow, after traveling by herself two
months through a district infested with
robbers. During this period she had
only a few mouthfuls of rice daily to
keep life in her. The lady is well
known in the vicinity of Montreal,
where she took a medical course with a
view of doing missionary work in the
Orient. Prior to leaving she married
an educated Hollander, Peter Rijnhart.
Her remarkable story, as told in the
Chinese exchanges just at hand, is as
follows: "My husband and I supported
ourselves for three years by practicing
medicine among the hill tribes of China
and did missionary work as well. Last
May we decided to make a journey into
the heart of Thibet. We were denied
a passport as the authorities said we
would never return alive. However, we
started out with our one-year-old baby,
three servants, a caravan, two years'
provisions, stores and gospel books.
"About the end of Aueust, at the foot
of the Shlhdaugla mountains, the baby
died and left us grief stricken. When
died and left us grief stricken. Whehn
we t reached Najachuka, robbers stole
five of our horses. At the next town
we applied to the Thibet officials for
passes and were again refused. Our
troubles culminated when we secured
new guides, who did not know the way,
and on the 21st of September we were
lost in the terrible Gumba mountains.
We encamped on the Nachu River,
when on the second day we were sur
rounded by fully 2000 robbers, all armed
and * all desperate looking men. They
seized the entire caravan, .killed the
natives and after terribly ill-treating
my husband left us to starve. On the
26th of September my husband, sick
and weak, walked to the robbers' camp
to ask for enough rice to keep us alive.
I never saw him again. Next day I
followed him and the robbers told me
that if I would become one of the
chief's numerous wives my life would
be saved. I refused, but told them I
would act as doctor for the tribe. They
gave me a trial on a fever patient and
I was successful. I was then treated
with the greatest respect, some of the
tribe fairly worshiping me. -
"I managed to escape in the night to
Tashi Gomba â¢ and received help and
protection from a Thibetan abbot. I
was given food and, almost alone, made
the journey to Tachienlu. I had some
marvelous escapes and twice nearly
starved to death."

ORDERLY LAWSON
WOUNDED AT MANILA
The many friends of Laurin L. Lawson, a private of the First
Washington Regiment, U. S. V., will be shocked to read his name among
the wounded in the recent battle at Manila. His home is in La Crosse,
Wisconsin/but for some years he had been in business in Minneapolis, and
would have volunteered with the Minnesota regiment only for the" war break
ing out while he was In Seattle. He joined the Washington regiment and
came with thei.i to this city, where they were quartered for six months. \ 7
Mr. Lawson would be noticeable in any gathering for his bright, hand
some face and graceful bearing, adding to this a charming, refined manner
and a high order of intelligence. His soldierly carriage and exquisite neat
ness gained for him the coveted position of orderly to Colonel Wholley,
which position he occupied at the time the regiment sailed for Manila. He
made hosts of friends in regular army circles, and in society, who are hop
ing to hear soon that his wound will not prove serious.

ENORMOUS
DEFICIENCY
Cannon Sounds a Warning
Against Extravagant
Appropriations.
Says Neither the Ship Subsidy
Nor Nicaragua Canal Bill Can
Pass This Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â Chairman
Cannon of the Appropriations Commit
tee of the House, in the course of the
general debate on the sundry civil bill
to-day sounded a note of warning
against extravagant appropriations and
practically served notice that neither
the ship subsidy bill nor the Nicaragua
canal bill could be passed at this ses
sion. Although he specifically dis
claimed speaking for any one but him
self, the statements he made, coming
from the chairman of the Appropria
tions Committee, caused great interest.
Cannon made ; a general statement of
the revenues and expenditures for the
present fiscal year, increasing Secre
tary Gage's estimate of the deficiency
in the revenues from $112,000,000 to $159,
--000,000, exclusive of the $20,000,000 to be
paid to Spain under the provisions of
the treaty of Paris. :.'. !
Grosvenor of Ohio, Hepburn of lowa
and W. H. Smith of Michigan, although
they did not enter into any lengthy
discussion, took issue with Cannon, but
he maintained that our revenue might
be sufficient to meet our expenditures
for the next two years if needless ex
penditure was not entered into. He in
dicated that it would be a close mar
gin and that new expenditures might
mean a bond issue. Cannon's speech
was in .very way a notable one and
doubtless will furnish the text for a
good deal of discussion during the re
mainder of the. session.
n h -f_ 52 vu f e A5 cn o_- ent into committee
?J5Â£ c T h< ! le (Mr _ Sherman of New York
in the chair), and took up the considera
tion of the sundry civil appropriation bill.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois, in charge of the
measure, made a general analysis of what
â¢ _ , _} *?' lned * " It carries $62,928,101, but $20,
--000.000 â¢is for payment to Spain to carry
out the provision of the Paris treaty. Ex
clusive -of that the bill carries $8,095,756
less than the estimates and $5,929,311 less
than the current law.
In connection with the bill Cannon
made a general statement as to the con
dition of the .revenues. The Secretary of
th ?_ '.Treasury ,r in October last, Cannon
said, had estimated the deficiency of the
cf cv < c Â£ u _' _' or _. the fiscal year ending July
1, 1899. to be $112,000,000, or a monthly aver
age $9,333,000. In, his judgment. In the
light of the receipts and expenditures for
the first seven months thus estimated, j
the deficiency was much too low. The ac
tual deficiency up to February 1, 1899, was
$93,151,000, an average of $13,307,000 per j
month. At this rate the deficiency for the
fiscal year would be $159,000,000. But this
would not Include the $20,000,000 provided I
by the bill to carry out the provision of
the Paris treaty. The cash balance in
the treasury on February 1, including the |
, $100,000,000 - gold reserve, was $274,000,000.
Two hundred millions of that had been j
| put into the revenues by the war loan.
i Deducting the monthly estimated deficien- I
i cy for the next five months there would, I
I he said, be in the treasury, July 1, $208,- |
| 000,000. This was a conservative estimate.
There would be, therefore, $108,000,000 to
meet the ordinary expenses of the Gov
ernment on that date. These figures, he '
continued, took no account of the sink- j
ing fund. To care for It would require
$53.000 ,000 additional.
-As Cannon : proceeded the most Intense
interest was manifested in his statement.
The Secretary of the Treasury estimated
the expenditures for the next fiscal year,
exclusive of the sinking fund, he said, at
$641,000,000 and the revenues at $610,000,000
or a deficiency of $31,000,000. Yet, Cannon
continued. Secretary Gage could not pos
sibly have foreseen In his estimates for
1900 the changed conditions which followed
the* negotiation of the peace treaty, the

NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â Coroner. Hart
began to-day an inquest into the death
of Mrs. Kate J. Adams, who died from
poison on December 28. The most gen
erally accepted I theory has been that
some person or persons with a secret
to hide had attempted to disposed of
those having knowledge of the secret,
and that Henry C. Barnet, a former
member of , the Knickerbocker Club,
who died November 10, had fallen, a
victim to poison sent him anonymously
in the mail.
Harry Cornish was the first witness.
Mr. Cornish told of. receiving the bottle
of medicine and a silver bottle-holder
at ' the Knickerbocker Club on 'â  Decem
ber 24, and -of preserving the - wrapper,
and subsequently taking the articles to
the flat where he â  lived with Mrs.
Adams ) and Mrs. Rogers. He narrated
the circumstances . leading to the prep
aration *of I a dose of j the drug for- Mrs.
Adams, who, after : drinking it, re
marked that it was very bitter.
.Cornish said he drank t what was ; left
in the ;.'; glass â¢ and â¢ said: '.'That's all
right." Then he sat down to read, but
was startled by . a call * from "', Mrs. Rog
ers, "Come and hold mamma." 77: i
, He found Mrs. ; Adams apparently
very 'ill In the bathroom, hurried 7 the
I hallboy fora doctor and ran to a drug
store for instructions. \: ,-. .'
-'.The druggist gave him sweet â¢ spirits
of ammonia for her. r No doctor having
arrived Cornish ran for Dr. Hitchcock'
and later, at Dr. Hitchcock's request,
fetched - Dr. \ Potter. â  Mrs. Adams died,
and the doctors told him the case must
be reported to the Coroner. .; . .
The witness said. he < went to Assistant
District Attorney Mclntyre, his per
sonal x friend, and asked f him to . expe
dite the action of the Coroner. 'All 1 this

occupation of the Philippines and the ob
ligations which we assumed in the peace
treaty to discharge the claims against
Spain, which claims, he understood, al
ready reached $25,000,000. Neither did the
Secretary's estimate, he said, take into
consideration the increase of the navy.
It estimated only the ordinary main
tenance of the navy. But the naval com
mittee would report in its bill a provision
for from twelve to fifteen battle-ships and
cruisers. We did not complain. It was a
logical sequence. The army must be In
creased. It was, therefore, the part of
wisdom and common prudence to fully
realize the condition which confronted us.
With these enormous expenditures upon
us, Cannon said, we must plant our foot
steps with care and see that no dollar
goes out of the treasury except for an
efficient public service.
"Do you take into account in your esti
mate," interrupted Dockery â¢ (D.) of Mis
souri, "the Hanna-Payne subsidy bill?"
Cannon replied that he did not include
in his calculation of a deficiency of $159.
--000,000 either the legislation for an efficient
merchant marine or the construction of
the Nicaragua canal. He favored the re
generation of the merchant marine (Re
publican applause) and the construction
of the Nicaragua canal. (Republican ap
plause.) "But," he added, with great em
phasis, "I am not willing to enter upon
either of these great enterprises until we
have given them full and proper consider
ation and we have provided the revenue to
meet these expenditures. I insist that
there shall go hand in hand with legisla
tion for these projects the legislation nec
essary to provide the revenues to meet
their cost. :-xy
"Does the gentleman mean," interposed
Carmack (D.) of Tennessee, "that owing
to the responsibilities we have assumed
abroad we must spend less money at
home?"
Cannon replied that nothing he had said
could be distorted into such a statement.
But he gave it as his opinion that the
United States could never again spend
less than was spent in the year prior to
the war with Spain. He did not stand
in his place seeking to cripple an
efficient public â¢ service. for a great and
growing population, but he was op
posed to entering upon new lines of ex
penditure until "there had been full con
sideration and real debate, and not then
unless there was already on the statute
books revenue legislation to meet me
expenditures."
Cannon proceeded to point out that all
the time for the remaining three weeks of
the session would be occupied, and that
there would be no time to give these
measures the intelligent and proper con
sideration they should have. The whole
House was aroused by the statement.
Grosvenor R.)' of Ohio wanted to know
whether Cannon assumed that one of the
great committees of the House (the In
terstate and Foreign Commerce Commit
tee) had been idle or derelict in its duty.
It was prepared to enlighten the House
on the subject of the canal.
Cannon Insisted that nothing he had
said reflected upon that committee. But
It was simply an organ of the House.
He was not charging it with dereliction,
but if it could multiply itself tenfold in
strength and wisdom* there was no time
In the next three weeks to place itself
In touch with the measure so that the
House could intelligently determine the
legislation necessary for the inaugura
tion of that great work.
Hepburn, chairman of the Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce, asked
Cannon to be more explicit. Coming from
him a statement meant a great deal, He
demanded to know whether Cannon was
to be understood as saying that no op
portunity was to be given for the consid
eration of the Nicaraguan canal bill.
Cannon disclaimed any. purpose of
â¢ speaking for any one but himself. - -.7-y.-,<
"I am one member," said he. "I speak
only for myself. I voice only my own
opinion. I do not reflect the sentiment
of others, but I do say candidly upon my
own responsibility that It Is absolutely-
Impossible In the time remaining for us
to intelligently consider either of these
bills." -â¢ -.-â¢".â -
while, the witness said, he was ill. He
i went to the club about 4 p. m. (Mrs.
Adams' death having occurred during
the forenoon), and there was taken
seriously ill. Dr. Phillips gave him
treatment for over an hour, using a
stomach pump. . X-X 77X7
The witness could suggest no motive
for the poisoning; he had no auarrel
with any one and, so far as he knew,
had no enemies. Subsequently he modi
fled this statement and admitted that
he had had "differences," one about
eighteen months ago.
Cornish was questioned about the
illness and death of H. Barnet. the
questioning bringing out the fact that
the two * men had not been on the best
of terms. Cornish's information re
garding - Barnet's ; illness was obtained
through Dr. Phillips, who attended him
near the end, when Dr. Douglas was
called in. . :;.;''' ; 'â¢'; â *;:' .':-â 
"Did you have any idea who sent you
that box?" asked Osborne, 'suddenly.
"I have no idea. I was in no posi
tion to know."
"Did you not tell Captain McClus
key," reading from a typewritten state
ment, "It came over me in an "instant
when I thought of * . Mollneaux â
just the fellow who sent that box to
me"? . â¢ â 
Cornish replied that that must have
j been his Impression when he made the
statement to Mr. McCluskey. He could
not think of any other man on earth
with whom he had had any kind of
quarrel that could leave a feeling of
vlndictlveness. Mollneaux had tried to
cause him to lose his position. When
witness heard about the handwriting
it struck him that the writing on the
wrappers was like the writing of Moll
neaux. He had not the original of the
wrapper, but the fac simile in the news
papers . reminding him of Molineaux's
writing. Adams was really the first
man to put that thought into his mind.
Witness did not know of any disagree
ment between Mollneaux and Adams.

Mollneaux in his life. *

Special Dispatch to The Call.
-," DAWSON CITY, Jan. 19, via Seattle,
.'Wash., Feb. 9.â The sensation of the
moment in Dawson is a stampede
'started a week ago by some old timers
and well-known characters of the coun
try. Several hundred men left the city
â  on last Tuesday and have not , yet re
turned, although it is more than a
week ago. Numbers have come in, as
'is- always the case, having been com-
: pelled to drop out of the race short of.
.Its destination. Some of these had feet
; -or hands frozen. Some were merely
unable to keep the pace, while the gen
eral complaint was a lack of provisions
. for such a long run.
' The destination of the stampeders is
' not actually -known to any one here,
nor is it known just exactly on what
information the stampede is based, but
the "tip" that started it is credited
with being straighter than anything of
the kind that has come to town for
some time.
'.* "Nigger" Jim, who occupied such
wide space in the newspapers outside
ia_t summer in the pose of an El Dorado
â¢King, is at the head of the procession,
'.'â¢wherever it is. and that fact, for his i
name has a good deal of potency here,
Is. responsible for the length of line
â¢following. A friend or partner of
â¢â¢' "Nigger" Jim's came to town on Mon
day and exchanged' or deposited $3000
in gold dust and made ready to leave
â  again. ... . -X'-Xx
'â  '.'Nigger" Jim himself is said to have
: .had much difficulty In securing the in
formation as to. where the stuff , had
been found. He prepared to accom
pany his friend,, but in the meantime
pent a messenger up the creek to notify
.'a few other friends. The town was
.Soon agog with the news, if it could be
. so called, a vague report of a big find
somewhere by somebody, and that
'"Nigger" Jim was going.' A crowd
.gathered in the street to watch a. dog
â¢team that had been posted in front of
â¢the Pioneer saloon. Others. made' ready
to follow the team when it should start,
â¢hitching up their own teams and load
ing their sleds with provisions. "Nig-,
ger" Jim's outfit and that of his friends
'was stationed at the back of the sa
"â¢loon, and when all was ready -they
started from there as quickly as pos
sible. Some saw the move at once
. ; and followed ; others * were tardy and
the leaders were a long -way down the
river before they discovered what had
taken place. Many others, slow In get
ting the news, started late that night
and even the next day.
â¢"."Nigger" Jim and his big following
have returned to town, all of them very
much the worse for a very trying ex
perience, none of them having driven
a stake. Jim led them into the moun
' tains, where they floundered breast
.deep in the snow, for two days.. He
: made several attempts to elude the
â¢crowd, but being unsuccessful. finally
declared he .had lost, his way and took
the- back track. Many of. the 600 suf
fered with frozen feet, hands and
â¢faces, as the thermometer has ranged
.'about 30 below, few had proper equip
ment for such a trip and only the
; chosen had snowshoes and sufficient
â¢provisions.
â  *.' Various are the guesses concerning
"the adventure. It is believed that Jim
will make another ana less conspicu
ous start for the new creek, although
it is safe to say that- few who followed
him this time will try it again. Others
believe that the whole thing was sim
' ply a rank fake to gain notoriety.
.. From the Kuyokuk there is little
news* as yet. A good deal of prospect
ing is going on, but at the time the
latest intelligence came out It was too
early for any definite knowledge of the
ground to have been obtained. Circle
and Eagle City are both reported in
â¢ cheerful spirits- and thriving. Cabins of
"Circle empty last winter are nearly all
occupied again, and Eagle City has
grown to be a place of 300 cabins. From
Captain Geiger and others I have
â¢learned the location and situation on
nearly all the steamboats that are
frozen in on the river. The McArnold.

The breaking up of the river in the
spring will work havoc with very many
of them, and very many thousands of
dollars invested in steamboats will cer
tainly be crushed up in the ice.
There has been another complete
breakdown in the mail service, espe
cially that of the American contractor.
Richardson, and no word has been re
ceived from the outside since the river
closed, except the vague reports from
an occasional traveler. The Canadian
mounted police here have undertaken
to take out a mail every two Weeks
without regard to the contractor, but
there Is reported to be a small moun
tain of* mall at Bennett, which they
seem unable to move. The loss of the
official mail which went through the
Ice on a sled about six weeks ago has
caused the officials here a deal of ex
tra work lit rewriting their reports.

JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 3 (by steamer
Rosalie, to Victoria, Feb. 9).-â po
lice,in Atlin may have something to do
any. day now besides sitting before the
fire. Feeling 'runs high since the news
of the exclusion act reached there;
trouble is brewing, -and defiance of the
authority of the police may be shown
any day. .*. 'â : , .*
This is the latest news brought down
this morning by' the steamer Wolcott,*
plying between Juneau and Lynn Canal
points. â¢ Anticipation of some trouble of
this, nature is in all probability what
took Stipendiary Magistrate Rant to
Atlin recently. He left Skaguay for
Atlin City six days ago. A report, un
corroborated, has come over White
Pass that Gold Commissioner Graham,
who has been hibernating at Bennett
this winter, has recommended the in
crease of the police force not so much
at Atlin City as at Discovery City, on
Pine Creek. Â» .â¢V* , i'-
Recently men have been flocking Into
Atlin at the rate of from thirty to fifty
a day. Last comers to the coast over
the trails estimate the number at about
those figures. Most of these are Cana
dians. They -are proceeding ' without
hesitation to take possession of the
ground staked by American miners,
and that is where the trouble is. They
go along the creeks and drive their
stakes right over the first locations
made by the "early birds,", who were
quick to follow Fritz Miller, the locator
of Discovery claim. Naturally there is
a good deal of friction, and ls feared
blood will be shed.
This Is considered more imminent
from the fact that all the information
is in possession of the Canadian "jump
ers,-'* so-called, who came from the Ca
nadian towns on the last ships and
from coast towns â  of: Alaska, fortified
with all the facts and full knowledge
of 'the legislation at Victoria. On -the
other hand,, the American claim hold
ers have meager information and are
at a considerable disadvantage in not
knowing just what . to do. Thus very
valuable claims, possibly worth large
fortunes, or at : least an Independency
through life to most men, are being
taken awayâ usurped and appropriated
before the very eyes of their first lo
cators and owners, men who acquired
them last summer at considerable ex
penditure of both. money and labor. It
is understood that even improvements
need not be. paid for -unless the Cana
dian locator Is so magnanimous as to
reimburse the first locator.
It now transpires that certain* men'
who left Atlin last November for Vic
toria and Vancouver went south with
the purpose of promoting legislation
aimed at the exclusion of aliens and,
being familiar with the lay of the land,
so to speak, at Atlin, will be able to
profit greatly by the turn of affairs.
Building operations are yet-suspended
at Atlin City and Discovery City.
These, town sites are to be surveyed.
Owners of buildings do not, therefore,
know whether their buildings will b_
in the street or not. Â it must necessar
ily be several weeks before this sur
vey is completed, and there is the add
ed possibility that the survey may have
to be sent down to Victoria- for ap
proval. That would cause more delay.
Merchants at Skaguay are still com
plaining of no business". .Up in the
Porcupine country there is about
twelve feet "of snow, and it is almost
impossible to get around even on snow
shoes, as the snow on top is very
light and soft. It Is ho thicker in some
places than 1 soap suds, and snowshoes
sink down almost knee deep in places.
The creeks were frozen during a re
cent cold snap and traveling is easier
Men in search of gold seem to prefer
camping in twelve feet . of snow, the
hardest kind of work, discomfort and
even hardship, if they may be near the
spotâ though they can do no prospect
ing till the snow goes offâ to remaining
in towns where they may be comforta
ble and at no more- expense." Conse
quently they are struggling up to Por
cupine on the ice.
The exclusion act Is expected to send
a big rush into this country in the
spring. The stakes on claims in many
creeks in the Porcupine, Salmon River
and other districts in that section will
be found piled up three stories high
when; the . snow goes. Nobody ques
tions that owing to the snow which
hides the stakes some creeks have been
located and relocated several times '

Cheerful News to a Lot of Dry . Men

the Whisky Famine Is
Averted. .
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SKAGUAY, Alaska, Feb. 6 (via Seat
tle, Feb. 9).â There are warm times at
Skaguay now, and they are getting
hotter each passing day. ' Sunday was
a day of excitement. The most cheer
ful news to a lot of dry men in; a cold
climate was that the whisky famine in
Atlin and Dawson, which became im
minent after, the arrest of the Ameri
can convoys, has been averted. After
thinking over the ultimatum the Can
adian officials at White Pass. Log
Cabin and Bennett, concluded that they
wouldn't arrest any more convoys if
such action carried with It .the exclu
sion of whisky. So now- the grave in
ternational complications that threat
ened are a thing that might have been,
and whisky is the password to peace.
Horsemen dashed through the town*
yesterday afternoon in regular "Rough
Rider. style. There was trouble up at
the toll gate.- The toll gate up on the
Brackett wagon road at what is known
as Camp 9 has been a bone of conten
tion for several weeks. The packers
claim that the trail-beyond that point
and this side of White Pass was made
not by Brackett, but by the original
packers on the trail, and that Brackett
has no right to charge toll over it.
A crowd of about .fifty, packers, all
mounted on : sprightly steeds, suddenly
appeared at the toll gate yesterday
afternoon. They demanded to go
through without paying. The gate
keeper refused. Axes were produced, *
and the packers, led by J. H. Brooks j
and Burt Johnson, chopped down the
toll gate. They carried away the pieces |
and dumped them down the ravine Into !
the river. Then Mr. Brooks brought to I
light a large bottle which he had con- )
cealed somewhere, and so far as It went
around the perdition of the, toll gate
was drunk and toasted. Feeling very
jolly the whole crowd rode into town
and dashed down the principal .street
with their horses flecked with foam.
The wagon road company made com
plaint and the whole' crowd was ar
rested. The rough 4 v riders permitted
themselves to be arrested in a graceful
manner by a deputy United States mar
shal, for whom they gave three cheers
before they rode away on* their personal
recognizance as well as their horses.
NEW DISCOVERIES
MADE AT ATLIN
JUNEAU, .Alaska, Feb. 4 (via Port |
Townsend, Feb. 9). Parties who ar
rived from Atlln this morning report j
that on the 28th of January when they j
left Atlin there was nothing- known
there of the passage of the alien act.
New discoveries and records were be
ing made every day. Aliens were still
in the swim. The weather was very
mild. Food and whisky were getting
scarce, and very few were getting
through to Atlin on account of the fan
tail trail being impassable for loaded"
sleds. Lake Bennett was not .frozen
sufficiently to make traveling safe. The
pioneers of this country who are ac
quainted with* the. different routes to
the interior say in their opinion that
the Takou River route is without doubt
the most reliable and safest winter
route to the Atlin district.
A great many people who have tried
the different " routes are returning to
Juneau and going up the Takou. which
is frozen solid and well timbered all
along the entire trail from Salt Lake
to Atlin. * ' â¢â¢ â¢'*'*â

discover the cause of his death. The

buried alive. '----.. '..
Mr. Rigley was undoubtedly, interred
while in a .trance, it is contended by
physicians who viewed the body this
afternoon. On Wednesday of last week,
after a short illness," he apparently
died, and Dr. Monterey, the family
physician, declared he was dead. -
A few years ago Mr. Rigley took out
several insurance policies on his life,
and it was partly for this reason that
It was decided to hold .an autopsy to
ascertain beyond doubt the exact cause
of death. But for this the discovery of
the .terrible .;: mistake : that had been
made would never have become known.

MORMONS AT WAR
AMONG THEMSELVES
SALT LAKE, Feb. 9â A large and
enthusiastic audience greeted Senator
F. J. Cannon at the Salt Lake Theater
to-night when, he came on the stage to
deliver his lecture on "Senatorial Can
didates , and Pharisees." A special
train' from Ogden brought down a
large number of the personal friends
of the Senator.
The Senator referred to the recent
attack upon him by the Women's Re
publican Club of Utah, and made that
the basis for a discussion of the living
"questions how pending in' the State.
He then took up the whole subject of
the trend of politics in Utah, and set
the line sharply between the progres
sives and the reactionaries of the Mor
mon church. He pointed out. that Utah
came to the nation as a Hagar out of
a wilderness, with her empty water jar
and her dying child, and that the na
tion opened its arms to her and took her
Into its friendship and under its au
thority, in return for which the . na
tion is entitled to receive from her such
devotion as was never given by any
other State; that she cannot repay the.
nation except by holding to the highest
ideals, and that .for these John Hendy
Smith and Heber.J. Grant, apostles of
the Mormon church, have substituted
the lowest. ;.'â¢â¢â *'['' â  .
He. made. a touching reference to his
mother, whose faith and holiness had
always kept him in the church. He
said that when he faltered at the re
sponsibility which now confronted him
of seeking to have Utah spared the
possibility of the awful shame of a
Senatorship bought and sold he had
been Impelled by the remembrance of
what his mother said and did in the
last Senatorial fight when his father
was a candidate against him. She
came to him then and said: "I don't
want to be a Senator's wife. I only
want to be a Senator's mother." With
such courage standing behind him, with
a mother brave enough to discriminate
between father and son, he felt that
he would be recreant to all his ante
"ASSAULT UPON
THE REPUBLIC"
â  - *
Deputies Defend Court
â¢ of Cassation. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.'
: - . _____ ....-â  ';.-...
PARIS, Feb. 9.â score of Deputies,
including MM. Brlsson, "Bourgeois, Bar
thou, Sarrien, Poincare, Pelletan and
Millerand, have addressed an open let
ter to the Government declaring their
intention to uphold the supreme prin
ciples of justice as above all attacks.
The manifesto asserts that there is no
necessity to deprive the criminal cham
ber of the Court of Cassation of the
right of rendering judgment in the
Dreyfus case. - â  : [2'X7:2 ?7x-77t ' â¢ *
* M. Lebret, Minister of Justice, has
testified, say these distinguished mem
bers of the Chamber, "to the honesty
of the judges, and if the court is dis
qualified it will mean the triumph of
calumny. 'The honesty of - the whole
Court of Cassation will in turn be ques
tioned and the highest jurisdiction of
the country will thus be placed by the
executive power at the mercy of defa
mation." :'y'~xxy.2
In concluding the manifesto its sign
ers say: : 'The law proposed by the
Government is not a law of appease
ment but a law of civil discord, threat
ening the liberty, honor and security of
the citizen at a juncture when the
union of all republicans is required to
defeat; a combination of clerical reac
tion and Caesarian demagogy pre
paring for a third assault upon the re
public."
This step Indicates the growing op
position to the . revision â  bill, which,
even if it survives in the Chamber of
Deputies, is * almost certain to .be . re
jected by the Senate, largely recruited
from the magistrature and strongly op
posed to such changes of procedure as
the bill contemplates.
The publication of the text of the
revision committee's voluminous report
and the Mazeau dossier, serves to em
phasize the hollowness, not to use a
harsher word, 'of the charges of Ques
nay de Beaurepaire against the crimi
nal chambers. It is difficult to believe
that a man who was president of- a sec
tion of the court could have brought
such reckless accusations against the
Judges of another section, and it is
still more difficult to explain how the
Government could have been induced
by such trivial charges. to Introduce the
revision bill, unless it was riding for a
fall. '.;.â¢.;.-
The general belief is that nothing can
save the Dupuy Cabinet. In any event
to morrow's debate in the Chamber of.
Deputies is expected to be a very
stormy one. " â - â  â  -"

Deputy District Attorney here, died at
St. Luke's Hospital this morning as the
result of wounds Inflicted by himself
last Tuesday- afternoon. At 10 o'clock
to-night Mrs. Olga Lavrenius, a young
Russian widow, understood to have
been Rhodes' fiancee, shot and instantly
killed her 10-year-old son and then sent
a- bullet through her own brain, t
â¢ The tragedies of Tuesday and to
night both occurred at the Arno, a./ash
ionable hotel where Rhodes and Mrs.
Lavrenius .both boarded for several
months. .'.; ;
The cause of .. Rhodes' act is not
known. He was a bright attorney, with
good prospects and very popular. Tues
day afternoon he was found in his
room ,by his friend, John S. Mosby Jr.,
sop' of the Confederate colonel, rapidly
sinking from loss of blood, caused by a
deep gash in each arm and each leg.
He was taken to St. Luke's Hospital,
where he lingered till this morning,
though always expressing the wish to
die. - : ; : : '. -:--v 7X-7:
Mrs. Lavrenius attended him at the
hospital until his death, which she took
with seeming composure. To-night,
after her little son was asleep in his

then turned the weapon upon herself. "
Rhodes. was a Kentuckian. belongwtg

Mrs. Lavrenius was a beautiful wo

Five or six years ago they were par
doned by the Czar and came to this

: of the opinion that Rocket, a recent win
ner of an open stake at Ingleside Park,
can defeat any greyhound in the State
. excepting For Freedom. Thinking thusly
| Mr. Deckelman had a challenge published
in an evening paper for a match race,
best two out of three courses, for $500
, â  a side, first come first served, the con
-1 test to be decided at Ingleside Park on
the 26th inst. Doubtless the challen"e
would have been gobbled up by many dog
; owners ere this had there been a deposit
! placed in the hands of any reputable par.
--i ; ty as a guarantee of good faith on the
part of the challenger. However, if Mr.,
1 Deckelman is still of the opinion that his
, dog Rocket is equal to the. task of lower
i ing the colors of any representative of
; the kennels of this city al Ithe gentle
! man has to do is to deposit $100 in The
i Call office and it will be covered in short
1 order by the owner' of Connemara.. which
[ dog is considered by many expert fanciers
! the equal, if not the superior, of For
Freedom.
Judge John Grace has positively stated
' that he is strongly opposed to judging
' ; mAtch races, but Mr. Deane, the owner.
on Connemara, has . signified his willing
ness to run his dog against Rocket In any

STAGE HELD UP
BY A MASKED BUT
NERVOUS ROBBER
Two San Francisco Men Relieved
of Their Gash Near Santa
Barbara.
SANTA BARBARA, Feb. 9.â Three
times in twice as many months the
Santa Barbara and Los Olivos Stage
Company's stage has been held up in
the very same place and its passengers
relieved of their money and valuables,
and still the robber or robbers is at
large. From descriptions given and
his mode of operation it seems like the
work of one man. _:H.'. ;; >.
This morning at 9:15, as the stage
which leaves Lbs Olivos for Santa Bar
bara at 7 o'clock was ascending a short
grade, at the foot of which runs Stepp
Creek, situated near the red gate of the
San Marcos rancho and twenty-five
miles from this city, the passengers
were surprised to hear from behind
them the command "halt." On look
ing around they saw lying behind a
fallen oak tree a masked man and a
shotgun pointed at the sage. The sec
ond command to halt was given and
the stage was stopped. The robber
then said "Get out." A second time he
called, "Get out d d quick, you on
the back seat." E. L. Paddock and J.
W. Armstrong immediately complied
with the request,
"Empty your- pockets," was the next
request. Armstrong threw down $37,
and Paddock 59 or $10. The robber
â  turned his glance upon Paddock and
said: "You are faking and withhold
-1 ing some of your money. You are too
well dressed to carry so little with
you." Paddock pleaded that it was
all he had, but that he had a school
warrant which he had just cashed for
a party and would give him this, if he
wished. The robber said he was look
ing for cash and not for school, war
rants. He then commanded them to
turn all their pockets inside out. ' -
The driver just at this time noticed
that, the robber's gun (a double-bar
reled shotgun) was shaking very ner
vously, and he asked him to please
i turn it a little to one side, as he feared
it might go off. This the robber did,
but he was so excited and nervous that
he soon pointed directly at the bunch.
He ordered the two men to board the
stage and asked the driver to throw
out the Wells-Fargo box. The driver
said there was none and the robber
was satisfied. He then said that "the
other fellow looked as though he had
no money and .that he would not trouble
him." The "other fellow" was a man
; by the name of Hector, who Is a farmer
living in the neighborhood. They were
all .thanked for their money and the
j inconvenience he had caused them and
Ihe bade them good-by. As they were
I leaving he cried out "Tell Hicks I shall
i never bother him again, and that I will
j not be here when he comes."
Hicks is the ex-Sheriff who was . in
'â . office during the last two robberies. It
| was not twenty minutes after the stage
left .that a deputy sheriff was hot on
I the trail. In about ten minutes Frank
i Manderville and two men by the name
of Kelley were met. Manderville is a
TO THE MEMORY
OF WINGFIELD
Services in Honor of the
Late Bishop.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. BENICIA, Feb. 9.â Memorial service- :
were held in Benicia to-day in memory
of the late Right Rev. J. H. D. Wing
field, Bishop of Northern California.
: The service was preceded by the pre
i sentation of a memorial pulpit by the
many friends of the late Bishop. The
pulpit is a splendid piece of art and
â¢ architecture and is composed of fluted
I columns and ornamental filigree work
iof brass. The base is of solid oak- with
j a memorial plate,' on which are en
| graved the following words: "To the
' glory of God and in loving memory of
1 J. H. D. Wingfield, D. D., LL. D., mis
â  sionary Bishop of Northern California.
j Erected by his friends. 1833â i898."
Colonel L. S. Babbitt of Benicia ar
senal made the presentation address,
and.the services were conducted by the
: Right Rev. William H. Moreland of
; Sacramento and.the Right Rev. Wil
â  Ham F. Nichols, D. D., of San Fran
cisco. The topic of. Bishop Moreland
I was the Bishop as a preacher, and was
very Instructive and impressive. The
address by the Right Rev. Bishop
Nichols was the Bishop as a pioneer
Bishop, and in it he described
the history of the Bishop until the day
of his death. His address was listened
to with great attention and was the
most eloquent eulogy of a man who
labored so hard and earnestly for. the,
church he loved so well and the benefits
that have accrued to the northern dio
cese of this State.
: Rev. ' John Partridge of -Petaluma
spoke of the Bishop as a father to his
clergy, and In his remarks stated that
the clergy were loyal .to him to a man.
He placed the very highest value upon
a man and never changed his opinion
until actual experience compelled him
to do so. Bishop Wingfield was also a
strong believer in his clergy being ade
quately compensated for their, work.
His theory was that a few faithful, ex
perienced workers "were of more ser
vice than a greater number of ill-paid
men. Rev. Partridge stated- that in
one instance he showed his fatherly
care of the church, and where his sym
pathy resulted in the saving of a church
from the- Sheriff's hands and the auc
tioneer's hammer. He referred to Co
lusa. A loan of $1000 had been prom
ised by the Church Building Associa
tion. The people of Colusa had raised
$1800 and were relying upon this 51000
from the association. At the last min
ute the. people from the East declined
to make this loan, as they found fault
with the title of the : ground on* which
the .church stood. No* one ' could be
found to 1 loan this money. "Just as the
church and property were to be sold, '
and the people were all in despair, a
check was sent to ' the .treasurer with
the request that the name of the sender
should not be divulged.
Neither ' mortgage - nor. note was de
manded, simply .â¢ a".' receipt. ...To the
honor of Colusa people the amount was
repaid with interest. :* The Bishop was
without doubt singularly ' unselfish and
was a faithful adviser of rich and poor
alike. Rev. Partridge gave an excel
lent insight of Bishop Wingfield in re
lation as a' pastor to his church. ' ..
After this followed -the celebration, of
the holy communion by Bishop More
land of Sacramento. After the -cere
monies all the strangers who.had/at
tended were invited to a luncheon that
had been prepared by the ladies "of the
church. "
| deputy sheriff and he was told of the
j circumstances, and the man Hector
! went back with him to go in pursuit.
I Nothing has been . heard from these
j men up to a late hour.
Sheriff Stewart, who was returning
| from San Quentin, where he had just
[ taken some convicts, missed the robbed
stage this morning and was compelled
I to take another by way of Lompoc. He
! arrived in the city this evening and
j ascertained what facts were to be
| known, and immediately left for the
j scene of the robbery, accompanied by
! Deputy Sheriff Peter Storni, J. O. Arkly
I and his fine bloodhounds.
Paddock, of the firm of Jones, Pad
i dock & Co. of San Francisco, and J.
IW. Armstrong, of Miller, Schloss &
Scott of San Francisco, were the vic
tims. .These gentlemen are well known
throughout the State as the "heavenly
twins," because they are continually to
gether on the road. When seen at the
Arlington Hotel this evening and asked
to describe the robber they both agreed
that he was the largest man they had
ever seen. They said' that the robber
was lying on his stomach behind . a
fallen tree with his head and shoulders
above the log. He wore a red bandana
handkerchief as a mask, with holes cut
for his eyes, a blue jumper and blue
overalls, which Mr. Paddock said had
been washed and were slightly faded.
He wore no hat, and had very thick
sandy or brownish hair. They say he
had a decidedly "Dutchy" accent, and
they knew .it was not a disguised
voice, for he appeared to be very
scared, and his voice trembled in such
a way that it was evident that it was
not faked. His gun was very unsteady
all the time. Mr. Armstrong stated that
he was surely an amateur at the busi
ness. The stage drove slowly, and the
passengers looked back until they were
out of sight, but the robber did not
move from his position.
The stage driver, Frank Cook, says
that he believes it to be the same man
who did the holding up four months
ago, but he cannot account for the dis
guised voice. It occurred in exactly
the same place that the two other rob
beries occurred, but the robber was On
the opposite side of the road this time.
There are several theories going the
rounds this evening. One is that the
robber is a man living near the scene
of to-day's trouble, and who has been
suspected of the other two robberies.
This Is based on the statement that the
robber made as the stage was leaving,
"Tell Hicks I shall never bother him
again," and also that he was armed
with a shotgun. Another theory is to
the effect that he is the same man- who
has been doing the holding up in other
parts of the State and is traveling
around in this. business. -This is borne
out by the fact that a man answering
the very same description was seen yes
terday carrying a shotgun and a roll
of blankets about five miles farther u_Â»
the road. There are now ten or fif
teen men in pursuit, and both the Ven
tura and "San Luis Obispo .County Sher
iffs will join in the hunt.
LANKY FITZ TO
FIGHT JEFFRIES
No Chance for a Meet
ing With Sharkey.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â The chances
for a meeting between Bob Fitzsim- '
mons and Tom Sharkey in a twenty- I
four-foot ring for the heavyweight
championship of .the world are rather
remote. It was generally expected that j
these two would have been matched to
day for a limited round or finish con
test, but after parleying for over, an
hour Martin Julian and Tom O'Rourke
failed to agree on a date for the con
test and the negotiations fell through.
Julian immediately began to arrange
a bout between Fitzsimmons and Jef
fries and soon had the matter well in
hand. Jeffries was represented by J.
P. Egan, who. acted in behalf of Wil
liam A. Brady, now in San Francisco. |
The meeting, which was held in the I
Bartholdi Hotel, was attended, by a i
large gathering of sporting men and j
newspaper representatives. Julian ar
rived late in the afternoon from De- '
troit, but previous to his . arrival
O'Rourke announced that he had signed
Sharkey to meet Charlie Mitchell of
England for a purse of $11,000, the bout
to take place before the Bolingbroke
Club of London on May 29. : ;* r ; v*
Julian opened the proceedings by
stating he was ready to match Bob
Fitzsimmons against Sharkey and was
anxious to have the contest take place
as soon as possible before the club of
fering . the largest purse. He stated
that the conditions should be Marquis
of Queensberry rules to govern, with the I
exception that there should be no hit- I
ting in clinches or . breakaways, no
bandages to be worn by either con- j
testant and the pair should box twenty
five rounds if the contest should occur !
in this State, but if a club should offer I
a larger purse than any other and a
finish fight could be arranged then the
principals would accept that offer.
O'Rourke agreed to all these proposals, !
but- when Julian said the men should |
meet within eight weeks of the date of.
signing of articles O'Rourke objected.
He said that Sharkey could not meet
Fitzsimmons .. before November next.
Julian then said he' would extend the
time until June.
"That is impossible, also." said j
O'Rourke, "as Sharkey will meet i
Mitchell in London on May '29.*'
"You had ,no right to make that j
match," was Julian's hot retort.
"Well, we are out' for the money."
said O'Rourke, "and you would have
taken the same i offer if it came your
way." - . * â¢
. A war of words ensued during which
O'Rourke said: "Look here. . Julian.
I'll put up a forfeit or 510,000 to bind
Sharkey 'â¢ to meet your man in i Novem
ber, and you can make any matches
you* see fit for Fitzsimmons in ; the
meantime." â¢' * \ .*â _**
. â¢â â¢ â¢"I ,* know your reasons for not want
ing to fight now,* said Julian. \
"Well, I '*. can tell you," replied
O'Rourke, "I know Sharkey -is improv
ing-., â¢ while ; Fitzsimmons â¢' is â * standing
still, and as your man has not fought
in , two years I ! feel : that ' Sharkey has
a right* to dictate terms and should get
until November." . .' . 'â¢
"My, money, has been up. for a long j
time," replied Julian, "and yours Is '
only up for a couple of days." ;.
_' More words followed.- Julian r made
several references - to â¢ the i meeting hof
Fitzsimmons and Sharkey in San Fran
cisco, and finally said: "I * drop " all'

INSURRECTION
IN NICARAGUA
General Reyes Holds a Coromand

O ..-.. NEW YORK, Feb. 9.-A Washington special to the Herald says: O
O. Senor Correa, Charge d'Affaires of Nicaragua at Washington, has re- O
Â© ceived information showing the extent of the revolution which is now O
O in progress in his country. Practically the whole of Eastern Nlca- O
O ragua is in revolution, with Bluefields as a center of the trouble. The O
O . insurgents have . Greytown, at the mouth of the San Juan River, the O
O proposed. Atlantic terminus of the Nicaraguan canal. This point is O
O of special importance to the Insurgents, as It commands the railroad O
Â©through the San. Juan Valley, the only line on which President Ze- O
Olaya's. forces could advance against the insurgents. General Reyes, O
O who heads the. revolution, was until a short time ago one of President O
O Zelaya's trusted officers' and belleyed to be loyal to the Executive. He Q
O was sent to Bluefields as' military commandant in charge of a force- O
O of troops. He was allowed to import 'arms from the United States, Q
O and these. were sent to. him from Managua. All went well until he re- O

GENERAL SHAFTER.
THE cowardly and brutal attacks of the Ex
aminer, day by day, upon the commanding*
general of this military department are a foul
illustration of personal journalism. Because the im
* .â¢pudencc of its correspondents was properly rebuked
; ny General Shafter, in the discharge of his official
: duty at Santiago, without any public object what
ever and solely for the gratification of vindictiveness
the Examiner uses its type for display headings and
. '/re-vamped extracts, culled months ago from a few sen
sational newspapers, that are revolting alike to its own
'.-- readers and to citizens generally. General . Shafter
'.won his first honors in our Civil War. He was
'afterward distinguished in much of the hardest In
â¢'; dian fighting upon the continent. He captured San
tiago with a celerity that has hardly been equaled, but
has praised the army rather than himself. His fame
'is' national and historical. He has been an object of
' popular appreciation wherever he has traveled since
..active hostilities with Spain ceased. He is of old
. .American stock, and related to some of our best
citizens. The late Oscar L. Shafter, once a. Justice of
. the -Supreme Court, and who before he came to this
: -State barely missed an election to the Senate of the
â¢United States in Vermont, was both intellectually
I. and morally great. His brother, James McM.
â¢Shafter, was a jurist and a statesman, who achieved
success in Wisconsin- and in California. These de
' Ceased gentlemen are . widely and honorably repre
. sented by their descendants who live among us. Gen
. eral Shafter, whose high standing and reputation are
â¢due to his individual merits and to the services he
has rendered to his country, has fixed his home on
* our soil. In view oÂ£ all these facts there is a peculiar
meanness and atrocity in the attempt of the Examiner
to revenge itself, not on General Shafter himself, who
is. beyond the reach of its hammer and nails and may
.safely trust the nation with* the maintenance of his
â¢ good name, but upon his relatives and friends.
' * This is the kind of journalism that gives color to
* the legislative assaults upon the' liberty of the press.
President McKinley ought not to feel disturbed at
the prospect of having the beef scandal probed to
the bottom. Nobody dreams that he is personally
concerned in it, nor is it possible to suppose that the
executive of a great nation would for a moment de
sire to shield the unspeakable scoundrels who would
sell rotten meat for the use of the army. Let the
last rascal be exposed, even though the result lead
to changes in the army and the Cabinet.
Perhaps the city can hold back from teachers the

obtain a certificate entitling them to do more than
teach in a school for the feeble minded, unless, in
deed, circumstances forced them to become inmates.

THE PHILIPPINE SITUATION.
SELF-DECEPTION is bad policy for indi
viduals or nations. The native bloodshed in
the Philippines has brought on a situation that
must cause the keenest solicitude. It is useless, to
seek for evidence of who fired the first shot or struck
the first blow. Both have been given and taken, and
our relation henceforth to the Filipinos is that of
conqueror to the conquered. Our conquest is not
complete, but must be pushed to be effective. We
have cleared a space around Manila. The poor huts
of the natives have been burned and all shelter for
a hostile force has been destroyed as far as the cannon
and torch can reach. We have been taught, by the
example of Hastings and Give in dealing with
Asiatics, and by that of Malakoff in dealing with the
Arab tribes. . What followed after Plassey must follow
now, for all that our arms leave alive in the Philip
pines will be Asiatic. Our conquest must be gar
risoned and every plantation and compound must be
under military protection. We cannot exchange the
sword for the olive branch. Heretofore American sen
timent has saluted the gallantry of all native people
fighting for independence on their own soil.
Masaniello, La Rochejacquelin, Riel, Emmet, Tous
'saint. Simon Bolivar, Kossuth, Marco Bozzaris,
even Nana Sahib, as their several stories were told
or sung, inspired and thrilled the American heart. In
cur- literature the hero, struggling for the indepen
dence of his country, has been a prized figure, and
in our oratory his name has never failed to make
affluent the fountain of eloquence. For one hundred
and twenty-two years the American spirit has been
determined and fixed on that line of sympathy for all
people who aspired to govern themselves. That spirit
created the Monroe doctrine and was the leading
impulse in our declaration of war against Spain. Tlie
native Cubans aspired to independence. They gasped
on the point of a Spanish spear. Their agony was
within our range of vision and we ran to their rescue.
Cuban women were represented as in amis for inde
pendence, and their story, told in our Senate, sent a
wave of sympathy rolling across the continent. In
cur own Revolution we had one Moll Pitcher, who
fought for our independence, and she has been a
heroic figure ever since. Â
The Philippine situation has . changed all this.
Masaniello led the fishermen against Neapolitan state
oppression and national policy. La Rochejacquelin
summoned La Vendee against the Directory. Kiel
commanded the red-haired halfbreeds of the north
against Canada. Emmet died on the gallows for re
belling against England. Toussaint captained his
black destroyers against France. Simon Bolivar
stood against Spain. Kossuth defied Austria. . Boz
zaris -and the Suliotes withstood Turkey, and Nana
Sahib attempted to avenge Plassey against England.
But now we have reached the parting of the ways. A
far people, alien to us in race, has mistakenly fired a
shot in behalf of its independence when its freedorh
and self-government conflict with our new-born na
tional policy. They are rebels against us, and where,
in all the wide world, is there a country to sympa
thize with their aspirations or to mourn their women
who fell in action, sternly facing our* deadly arms and
deadlier aim? Every other powerful nation has done
just as we are doing, and to be consistent they ap
plaud the success of our arms. A light seems to have
gone out of the world. The beacon to which the peo
ple who aspired to be free could always turn has
gone out. National policy, the iron law, has ex
tinguished it.
In all history, there is no other such sudden and
complete reversal of a national point of view. We
have parted company with the memory of the dead
who were trampled under the hard hoofs of French
horses in the Palatinate, and the martyrs who were
swept from the Carnatic by the besom of Hyder Ali,
and contemplate with composure a distant conquest
of a protesting people, and without a pang count the
bullet-holes in the slender bodies of scores of dusky
Moll Pitchers, who fell in the trenches fighting for
independence, but against our national policy, and
perhaps against our hope of an increasing com
merce.
It was Halleck, an American, who wrote
"But, to the hero, when his sword
Is drawn in battle for the free,
Death's voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard .
The thanks of millions yet to be."
However, trade is the main thing, and, as it follows
the flag, woe', to those who fire upon that emblem of
profits.
Of course if people will stay in such places as Chi
cago and freeze to death, there is no way of prevent
ing it. Attention might be called to the fact that in
San Francisco the use of an overcoat is not deemed a
necessity, that there is summer in our air, and that
the formation of a film of ice barely perceptible to
the eye is regarded here as a marvel over which the.
oldest inhabitant marvels exceedingly, mourning that
the times have changed.
CATTLE QUARANTINE LfIWS.
A PETITION from his constituents, presented
to the Legislature by Senator Laird, asking for
a reform in the cattle quarantine laws, will
serve as another incentive toward the accomplish
ment of that much desired legislation. It 'appears
that our laws on that subject are radically defective,
and as a consequence one of our largest interests suf
fers serious^.
The evil was strikingly manifest during the drought
last summer, when the lack of pasturage in many
parts of the State rendered it necessary to ship cattle
to other sections. The effort to obtain some relief for
the cattlemen imposed upon Governor Budd and
other State officials a great deal of hard work, and
the deficiencies of the law on the subject were then
clearly perceived. *
In his last message to the Legislature the retiring
Governor strongly recommended the passage' of a
better quarantine law for cattle, and in doing so said
with reference to the experience of the previous
summer:
"Twice have eminent physicians . been sent to
Washington, D. C, in the hope of bettering our con
dition. Twice it has been necessary to request Dis
trict Attorneys to enforce strictly the criminal statute
cf 1893, and almost constantly the executive of the
State, or the secretary of the State Board of Health,
has been engaged in correspondence and investigations
on the subject The present quarantine law is in
sufficient. .Under the opinion of the Attorney
General of this State the contagious disease fund
is applicable to contagious or infectious diseases . of
human beings only. A law should be passed giving
full power to the State Board of Health to employ
such assistance as may be necessary, and the moneys
in the contagious disease fund should be. made , to
apply in cases of cattle quarantine in the same manner'
and to the same extent that they now do in cases of
human quarantine." â¢ .' - '; â¢; .
The special complaint made by the signers of- the 1
petition just-submitted is that the Federal quarantine
protects one State from another, but not one sec
tion from another section of the same State, and that
j the State laws are inadequate for the protection of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, ' FEBRUARY 10, 1899.
districts where cattle are healthy from those where
the cattle are infected with disease. The petitioners
ask that the State Board of Health be empowered to
declare a quarantine against any district where infec
tion exists. They also ask that the laws be so shaped
that the Federal Government may quarantine any
infected section of the State.
After the experience of so large a portion of the
State during the past summer, the legislators can
hardly ask for further proof of the need of the re
quested reform. It should be granted at once.
THE OSSAULT UPON MILES.
I__; ROM the vituperative columns of the New
| L '-7.. York the comes a long, double-leaded, scream-
York Sun comes a long, double-leaded, scream
ing editorial assault upon General Miles as
malignant in its intent and almost as coarse in its
wording as. that of the notorious Eagan. The em
balmed beef contractors have. evidently rallied 'all
their organs, and are trying to turn attention from
themselves by making an aggressive attack' upon the
man who exposed their frauds upon the soldiers at
the front.
The Sun declares that in making public charges
against the beef contractors and exposing the foul
nature of the beef furnished to the army General
Miles was guilty" of a greater offense than Eagan.** It
asserts that, by his disclosures the General has de
graded himself, disgraced the army, and brought his
country into reproach before the world in order to
further his personal revenge. Warming up to its
work of serving the beef combine, the Sun says:
"The offense of General Eagan was inexcusable in
its vulgarity, in its blackguardism; but it was with
out harmful effects except on himself. The. offense
of General Miles is of far greater damage. It
is demoralizing to the army; it is downright treach
ery in a commanding general . in time of war, and
should bring upon him the universal loathing of his
countrymen, as it will invite for him foreign con
tempt. He is no soldier. . His uniform should be
stripped from him. In no event should he be suffered
to remain commanding general of the army.".
In justification of this attack all that the Sun offers
is that General Miles has furnished newspapers with
information concerning the nature of the food sup
plied to the army. That this information was first
given in official reports to the War Department, and
afterward in testimony before the investigating com
mittee: that it is confirmed by reports from army
inspectors and regimental officers, the Sun counts as
nothing. "During the whole course of American
history," it says, "there has never been an example
of unsoldierly conduct on the part of an officer of
high military rank so disgraceful as that exhibited
by him (Miles) in inciting newspaper assaults on the
army and furnishing them with documentary ammu
nition."
In that assertion the Sun has permitted its tirade to
get the better of its cunning and betray it into the
utterance of a plain lie. There has been no news
paper assault upon the army, neither has the General
furnished any evidence,' documentary or otherwise,
to support such an assertion on the part of the wrath
ful beef organ. There has been an attack upon the
contractor*, who furnished foul food to the army, and
that attack has. been supported not only by what
Miles has told, but by ample and strong testimony
gathered from men who served with the- volunteers
and to whom the embalmed stuff was given as food.
General Miles need not regret the coarseness of
the attacks' the beef trust has': made upon him. Such
assaults as those made by Eagan and the Sun con
vince the people of the villainous nature of the men
who carried out the conspiracy to enrich themselves
by poisoning our troops with rotten beef. ; r The
rascals have been caught in their frauds, and the
more they howl the more certain will be the people
that they are guilty.
THE BALTIC AND BLACK SEA CANAL.
Ir^ OR some time past there have been frequent re
ports in this country of a project on the part of
the Russian Government to construct a canal to
connect the Baltic with the Black Sea, the waterway
to be of sufficient depth to permit the passage of war
ships from one sea to the other, thus enabling the
Russians to mass their full naval force at either point
without having to send the fleets on the long voyage
around Western Europe.
It now appears that this story, which has been told
with so much detail and apparently upon such good
authority,, is without foundation. The denial comes
from -official sources and is not to be disputed.
The circulation of the report led a considerable
number of Americans to apply to the American Con
sul at St. Petersburg for information on the subject.
In his account, published in the current number of
Consular Reports, he says: "I received a large num
ber letters from engineers, newspapers, contract
ors and manufacturers of excavating machinery, ask
ing for specifications, cost of labor, details of con
tracts, etc."
In order to be able, to answer these questions with
accuracy, the Consul General called upon Prince
Hikoff, Minister of Ways and Communications, and
learned from that official that no such project is un
der consideration by the Russian Government. The
Prince Is quoted as saying: "Some time since* a
French engineer called upon me with a map of the
suggested canal, as well as an estimate of the cost of
building the same. I asked where he procured the
data his estimates were based upon. He said, 'From
Russian maps.' I then informed him there are no
correct maps of that" portion of Russia, and his canal
was 900 miles short."
.'The Prince added the Russian Government has no
idea of building such a canal. He expressed a doubt
of there being sufficient" money in Russia to do so.
He said, however, there had been some consideration
of a project to construct such a canal of sufficient
dimensions to permit the passage of gunboats, but
that it had been abandoned because of the great Cost.
As there is no truth in the report it will be well to
have the denial as widely circulated as. the report it
self. It does not make so good a story, nor can it be
illustrated with maps, but the publication of the de
nial may save a good many enterprising Americans
from wasting time and labor in trying to get infor
mation on which they can base bids for contracts,

It may be advisable also to add to the denial the
wholesome moral that there are abundant opportuni

and it is not worth while to be looking for. contracts
in Russia or any other foreign and far-off country.

Conditions. â¢>
A special meeting* of the directors of the
Merchants' Asociation was held yester
day for the purpose of considering* pub
lic improvements and a number of pro
posed laws now before the Legislature.
Vice President Baldwin stated that the
bill for the suppression of poolrooms had
been introduced by Assemblyman Ather
ton at the request of members of the as
sociation. ' V .
There was an Interesting debate con
cerning the taxing of State, cOunty, school
district and city bonds.' The position was
taken by the board that on account of
the taxation of such bonds the people
here will not purchase them, and as a re
sult these securities are sold to Eastern
bankers, to whom the people of this State
pay tribute. It was pointed out that
the taxes on the million dollar bonds that
the State is about to issue for the con
struction of the seawall and other im
provements would be very great.
A resolution was passed declaring that
it is against public policy and contrary
to true principles of economy for the
State to tax its own securities, and ' the
Legislature is requested to propose an
amendment to. the constitution exempting
such bonds from taxation. " ; : :-
The secretary of the association was in
structed to send the following telegram
to the author of the bill providing for the
issuing of bonds by the State for the con
struction of the seawall:
Hon. Samuel Braunhart, Senate, State Capi
tol, Sacramento, Cal.: The board of directors
of the Merchants' Aesociation, in meeting as
sembled, unanimously resolved to oppose the
passage of your Senate bill No. 54, relative to
the construction of the seawall of this harbor.
Seawall construction should be paid out of the
current revenues of the Harbor Commission,
and we believe that these revenues are suffi
cient to accomplish this purpose. The aim of
the Merchants Association is to- revest in
the city and county of San Francisco the con
trol and ownership of its harbor front and
abolish tolls thereon.
MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
Action in relation to other bills pending
in the Legislature was taken as follows:
Favoring the passage of Senate bill 425
for the abolition of trading stamps; fa
voring the passage of Senate bill 42
adopting certain desirable amendments to
the Political Code in relation to pilots;
to oppose Assembly bill 12 repealing the
purity of election law; to oppose Assem
bly bill 19, the provisions of which would
nullify some of the desirable features of
the Australian ballot law; favoring the
passage of Assembly bill 208 for. the â¢ es
tablishment of a State civil service law,
and favoring, the passage of acts estab
lishing better provisions for the govern
ment of primary elections.
The committee appointed to consider the
scheme suggested by the Mayor of extend
ing Golden Gate Park panhandle to Market
street and the purchase of seven blocks
of land lying north of the park, reported
that while it indorses' the suggestion,
there are other matters requiring consid
eration flrst. The report concludes as
follows: .*. ,
We therefore recommend that the Merchants'
Association indorse the proposed scheme for
extending the park panhandle and for acquir
ing the blocks north of. Golden Gate Park, and
that at or about the same time an election be
held for the construction of new school build
ings and , other necessary improvements. In
our opinion the matters to be considered should
be taken up in about the following order:
Firstâ Main outlet sewers. Salt water pump
ing station for fire protection and for flushing
6ewers.
Secondâ New school buildings, hospitals, po
lice stations and necessary repairs to the pres
ent school buildings.
Thirdâ Parks and boulevards.

"OTHELLO" AND
THE SYMPHONY
Frederick Warde, Louis James and
Kathryn Kidder are having a prosper
ous season of it at the Columbia popular
izing the masterpieces. The bill "Wednes
day night was "Othello," the audience was
packed to sardine space arid the perform
ance was extremely interesting. In our
present poverty of legitimate acting it
signifies little or nothing to say that Mr.
James is the best Othello and Mr. Warde
the best lago on the American stage.
Even when Mr. James played a very over
done Moor last year it was still the best
portrayal of Shakespeare's jealous hero
that we had. This time Mr. James seems
bent on modifying himself, and both he
and ourselves are to be congratulated on
the result. His Othello was really a fine
tribute to his talent. No one can look
the part better than Mr. James, and when
he settles down to serious work and sets
aside the ranting tricks of the one-night
stand no one in this generation could ask
for a more strenuous and vivid character-'
ization. â  â¢
Mr." Warde is still inclined to make the
malevolence tof ' lago even more obvious
than the playwright wrote it , but despite
several notable exaggerations in his per
formance he acquitted himself fa
vorably. Especially in the scene of the
first imposition on-, the Moor's credulity
was his work strong and. telling. Barry
Johnstone gave a delightful version of
Cassio, playing with easy * authority in a
semi-modern vein. Miss Kidder's' Des
demona was ingenuous and original to a
degree and splendidly dramatic in the
scene of the first accusation; indeed, it
was a creditable interpretation, although
it lacked in the qualities of passion.
"Othello" will be repeated Sunday night.
Macbeth will be given Saturday, night
To-night and to-morrow afternoon will be
devoted to "The School for Scandal."
This .is the prospect for next week: Mon
day and Saturday evenings, "Julius Cae
sar"; Tuesday and Sunday evenings, "The
School for Scandal"; Wednesday evening
and Saturday matinee, "Hamlett": Thurs
day evening, "Macbeth"; Friday evening,
"Othello."
While the symphony concert in the Or
pheum yesterday afternoon divulged lit
tle that was novel it was still a marked
success and In every respect superior to
its predecessor, the only really bad con
cert of the seven given so far this sea
son. Mr. Scheel was enthusiastically him
self again, and the band, despite certain
shortcomings in the brass instruments,
which have been discussed here time and
time again, was in good form and tem
per. The "Lohengrin vorspeil was given
a thoroughly poetic and uplifting per
formance; the strings were faultless in the
difficult top-note passages, and the whole
rendition was remarkable for its clear ar
ticulation and imaginative coloring. Deli
cacy and accuracy of another character,
but equally as urgent, were notable in
the "Midsummer Night's Dream" scherzo,
which was encored. Two lively pieces
were "The Mill," Templeton Strong's or- j
chestral, arranged from a Raff quartet,
and hte extremely intimate second rhapso
dic of Liszt; both were given with good
dash and spirit. The long piece was Mosz
kowski's symphonic poem, "Joan of Arc,"
which renewed the favorable impression
made last year. The eighth and last con- !
cert of the season takes place a week
from Thursday, with & programme that
includes the wonderful â¢Pathetic" sym
phony of Tschaikowsky and three Wag
ner excerpts.
At the California Mr. Broadhurst's farce
of ""Why Smith Left Home" is making
out a good second - week. Black Patti's
Troubadours, headed by Ernest Hogan,

"Peaceful Valley" is in the last nights
of a two weeks' run at the Alcazar. The
new piece will be "A Gold Mine," a play
made famous by Nat Goodwin.

"Spider and Fly," continues at the Com
edy Theater. Miss Post ls now in good
health and able to take the role which
was so badly filled at the opening. Alto
f ether the production is greatly improved,
t continues the rest of this and all of
next week, giving way to John L. Sulli
van's vaudeville and athletic combina
tion.
: "Clorindy," the rag-time opera, finishes
with the week at the Orpheum. Milton
'and Dolly Nobles in "Why Walker Re
formed" are still a strong card, and tho
dog and monkey show is the best of its
kind ever given here.

The Pacific Ocean Exposition Planned
on Imposing and Attractive
' Lines by Its Pro

Charles L. Patton, chairman of . the
finance' committee of the Pacific Ocean
and International Exposition, accom
panied by Supervisor Lackmann, left for
Sacramento last night to set in motion
the legislative machinery for obtaining an
appropriation of $500,000 for the big fair
which' it is proposed' to hold in this city
in 1901. They will be joined this morning
in the capital by Henry J. Crocker and
Secretary Doolan.
In the bill asking for the appropriation
by the State it is -provided that the Gov
ernor appoint a. commission of fifteen;
who shall be known as the Pacific Ocean
and International Exposition Commission,
and have charge of the money contribut
ed by the State. 1. Vr!
In view of the fact that California ap
propriated $350,000 for a California exhibit
at the Chicago Fair, the committee ' an
ticipates no "trouble in inducing the Leg
islature to act favorably on its proposi
tion.
It is known that the Governor is very
favorably disposed toward the project,
and that the San Francisco legislative
delegation will use its united efforts and
influence in both the Senate and Assem
bly to secure the necessary legislation.
The San Francisco Supervisors have al
ready pledged themselves to make an ap
propriation of $750,000 to be extended over
a period of three years, and their action,
it is believed, will have great influence
in securing favorable action Dy the Legis
lature. After both State and city have
backed the enterprise in a financial way.
the promoters will knock at the doors or
Congress for similar support.
It is proposed to have the fair of 1901
established on such an imposing scale and
to make it so attractive that its benefits
will be felt not alone in California, but.
throughout the Pacific Coast and the
United States. "While special features will
be made of the natural and manufactured
products of all Pacific Ocean countriesâ
of Asia, Oceanica, South America, Central
America, Mexico and Canada, as well as
of the United States, including gold
famed Alaskaâ all the nations of the earth
will be represented. â¢ With the mighty
struggle that is at present in progress be
tween the great Powers of Europe for
commercial advantages in the Orient, it
is â¢ confidently anticipated that they will
see to it that their commercial interests
do not suffer at the coming San Francisco
exposition. __________________
LASTING MEMORIAL TO
GOETHE AND SCHILLER
COPY OP REITSCHEL'S FAMOUS
STATUE EN ROUTE HERE-
German Citizens of San Francisco
Will Erect It in Golden
Gate Park.
The monument to Goethe and Schiller,
Germany's two great poets, is now en
route to this country on a sailing vessel,
and probably will arrive some time next
month, when it will be erected on the
site selected in Golden Gate Park.
This monument, which will be erected
by the Goethe-Schiller Monument Asso
ciation, is an exact copy of the famous
one by Reitschel in Weimar, and is world
famed as a work of art. It consists of
life-size figures in bronze of the two poets
in the act of clasping hands, and sur
rounded by a laurel wreath. ' The pedestal
ls to be of marble quarried and cut In
California. " â¢_ â  ' â
The monument Idea is practically an
outgrowth of the Midwinter Fair. Ger
man Day at the fair realized $300, - and
Charles Bundscher suggested that this be
used as the nucleus of a monument fund.
On February 26, 1895, the association was
organized by prominent German citizens
and delegates from all the German socie
ties. A fair was held in Mechanics' Pa
vilion, which netted the association $5000,
and Dr. M. Richter, Dr. A. Barham, A.
Entzmann, H. Epstein, Professor Fluegel,
Dr. G. Gutsch, E. C. Prlbeo, Herman
Schussler and Dr. Sanger were appointed
a committee to order the monument. They
obtained the consent of the heirs of Reit
schel to use the old molds of the statue
at Weimar and decided that the pedestal
be a purely California product.
The site was selected by E. A. Denicke,
C L. Laumeister, Dr. M. Magnus, Otto
Mueser. Dr. F. P. Muffe. R. Wienecke,
L. S. Rose and F. H. Rosenbaum. The
monument is to stand in Golden Gate
Park facing the grand court between the
Museum and the Japanese Tea Garden.
The officers of the Monument Associa
tion are Charles Bundschu. president: M.

First Association Football Game of
the Season â at Sutro
Baths.
The Vampire Club of this city, who has
for the last two years been doing its j
best to revive interest in association foot
ball on this Â«oast, has arranged a very
attractive match for Saturday.
* The club will be opposed by the Moun
tain Copper mine team from Keswick, !
Shasta County. The Vampire team is \
largely composed of Englishmen em
ployed in banks and insurance offices in
town.
These teams met twice last year. The
first meeting took place at Alameda in
January. The game was a very good one,
and although the Vampires had more of
the play than their opponents the game
ended in a draw of one goal each. The
second meeting took place at Redding, on
â¢Thanksgiving day, when the Vampires,
after a very exciting tussle, beat their op
ponents by two goals to one goal. The
result was unexpected, as the Vampire
team was somewhat weak,. while the Kes
wicks had their best available team.
'.- Both teams will play their hardest-
Vampires to sustain their reputation in
the last game and Keswlcks to secure re
venge. Included in the Keswick team is
H- R. Plate, who played for Stanford in*
the big game on Thanksgiving day last,
and who is now located at Keswick. The
game will be played at Presidio athletic
grounds and will start at 3 p. m.

SANTA FE MEN HERE.
George Nicholson and John Player
Looking Over the Railroad
Situation.
â â '. George T. Nicholson, passenger traffic
: manager of the Santa Fe, with hparirjuar
. tors at Chicago, arrived in this city yes
terday and Is now at the Palace. Mr.
choir on stated that his visit had no es
pecial significance as far as his line was
concerned. He came out, he Bald, to. see
a sick child in the southern part of the
State.
In view of the fact, however, that the
Santa Fe Is about to absorb the Valley
road it is believed that Nicholson is here
to look over the situation" In connection
*rith the passenger traffic, though he
'.'would not express himself on that point.
The fact that John Player, the super
intendent of machinery, of the Santa Fe,
has also arrived from Chicago would
- make it appear that the two gentlemen
.are out here on railroad business. Player
Is supposed to be considering the availa
: billty of Point Richmond, Stockton, or
this city for the erection of machine shops

DEATH, THEN A NEW LOVE.
Fannie A. France Buries Her Hus
band and Remarries Within
Three Weeks.
Three weeks ago last Sunday George "W.
France departed this life, leaving a
widow and three children. Last Tues
day a marriage license was issued by
Cupid Danforth and on the same day
the "bereaved" widow of the dead man,
Fannie A. France, was united in mar
riage to Stephen Turner, a widower, of
Boston, Mass. Yesterday morning- an
application for a family allowance for
the support of Mrs. France-Turner from
the estate of her late husband was heard
by Judge Coffey, and when he heard that
the lady had again married he was
astounded and remarked that it was the
quickest case on record where a heart
supposed to be broken by death was
mended and made happy by another love.
The court promptly refused to allow
the lady a family allowance and ap
pointed the dead man's nephew, Oliver W.
France, as administrator of the estate
and guardian of the* three children.
LODGED IN THE "TANKS"
ON MERE SUSPICION
W. BARRON AND A. BLUM RUN
AFOUL OF POLICE.
They Are Said to Be Confederates of
Simon Gallick, a Recently
Captured Burglar.
Will Barron, who is said to he a civil
engineer by occupation, and Al Blum, a
hanger on around the Palace beer hall,
were taken into custody- last evening by
Detective Sullivan and Officer O. H. Phil
lips and lodged in the "tanks" of the City
Prison, pending investigation.
Neither of the prisoners was informed
on what grounds he was arrested, and
they are now deprived of their liberty and
their right to notify friends or counsel of
their Incarceration, until the officers of
the law are satisfied of their guilt or in
nocence.
Blum was taken out of the beer hall
1 without warning and later Barron was
[ arrested on Market street.
Both Sullivan and Phillips were detailed
by Captain Bohen, Chief of Detectives,
to gather further evidence against Simon
; Gallick, the young burglar who was near
ly killed on Wednesday while fleeing from
j the police, after robbing the Hotel Mare
chal Neil. As* was stated i The Call
of yesterday, he was pursued by Bellboy
Timmerman, and sought safety in a coal
yard, in which place he' was flrst cap
tured. On his second break for liberty he
'â¢â  evaded Policeman Murphy and a special
I officer, and hid in a basement on Willow
i avenue, where he was found by Officer
j Phillips. *--*---;i â¢ "â¢'-,*â¢â â¢'
Detective Sullivan and Phillips in their
search for evidence against Gallick found
a skeleton key and some of the booty in
! the coal yard. and also made a search of
i his room for stolen stuff, but his pals
i were ahead of them and carted away all
evidence of his guilt. -r ' ,
Young Gallick was placed on the grill
! by the officers last night, but refused to
incriminate others. It is understood he
will plead guilty to the charge against
him and thus avoid a drawn-out trial.
It Is probable that the police think that
in Barron and Blum they have Gallick
confederates, and until they have evi
j dence to the contrary both men will lan
guish in prison. , â¢'â¢

WAITING FOR McKINLEY.
Ohio Society Preparing to Welcome
the President.
That President McKinley will visit this
city during the_ present year seems now
to be settled. Knowledge of this fact
brought out a large and enthusiastic at
tendance of the members of the Ohio So
ciety ot, California at their monthly gath
ering last night in Mystic Hall.
The' meeting was called to order by
President Ben B. Haskell with the aid of
a brand-new gavel. This gavel, a fine
specimen of artistic workmanship, has an
interesting history. It was sent to the
financial secretary, Norman R. Arter. by
Job Reeder, of Hanoverton, O. Its head
is made of the wood of an. apple tree cut
from President McKinley's farm in Ohio.
The handle is made of a black walnut
rail split by a soldier of the Revolution
during the first year of Ohio's existence
as a State, in 1803. In the handle the let
ters I. X. L. are Inlaid with wood picked
up by the donor from the battle field of
Chickamauga. Mr. Reeder. who made the
gavel after he reached the age of 70 years,
is the son of a Revolutionary sire, and |
during the Civil War he marched in the j
famous Twenty-third Ohio to the same
music as did President McKinley under !
the command of Major-General Ruther
ford B. Hayes. . _____
J. A. Woodruf was elected a member
of the society. He* is one of the ninety
six surviving members of the Twenty
third Ohio who escorted the President as a
guard of honor at his inauguration. There
are nine others of the regiment now living
in California.
The committee on arrangements and re
ception of the President reported that an
early visit .from the President is now
practically assured. There are over 30,000
natives of Ohio resident within this State,
and it is thought that at least 2000 of
these can be mustered Into line.

MRS. REGAN'S
VILE STORY OF
THE KILLING
Describes Her Fight
With Kennedy.
HE WAS SHOT IN A ROW
BOTH STRUGGLING FOR POSSES
SION OF. A PISTOL.
Disgusting Tale of Vulgarity and
Vice Is Recited by the Alleged
Murderess on the Witness
Stand.
Mrs. Elizabeth Regan continued her tes
timony in Judge Graham's court yester
day and described the killing of Police
man Thomas H. Kennedy in her house
on January 12. She declared that, al
though she did not dislike him, she had
ceased to love the man she claimed had
promised to marry her long previous to
that time, and strenuously contended- that
she had no motive In causing- his death.
She said she had continued to tolerate his
presence , because â â¢he feared him, even
though she defied him whenever he
showed a disposition to be ugly.
Almost in the same breath the woman
who is accused of murdering her lover
because he was about to sever his rela
tions with her told how he had shed tears
copiously on the slightest provocation,
and said she could make him cry by sim
ply raising her finger at him. She denied
that he had informed' her that he intended
to marry another woman, and swore she
had never heard of Miss Sohrman until
questioned about her by a reporter for
The Call after her arrest and confinement
in the City Prison. She admitted that
she had continued to receive Kennedy at
her house at all hours of the day and
night up to the time or the tragedy, al
though their relations of intimacy had
practically ceased ln November of last
year.
Mrs. Regan was on the stand all day,
and told the story of her relations with
Kennedy, including their frequent quar
rels from the time they first became ac
quainted Up to the time of his death, even
to the minutest revolting detail, so far as
her memory served her, and concluding
with a recital of the events leading up to
the final act in the "disgusting drama.
She placed no .restraint on herself when
I repeating the language, which she alleged
he was accustomed to use in addressing
her, and the vileness of the recital caused
I even the barnacled court habitues to
j blush. She bared her shame to the world
j and did not falter until late in the after-
I noon, when under the merciless cross-
I examination of Attorney Barrett her
nerve failed her and a few tears found
their way to her eyes. But she stuck to
her story. She was still on the stand
when court adjourned, but the cross-ex
amination will be completed to-day.
The courtroom was well filled when tho
hearing was resumed in the morning, a
fair sprinkling of women being among the
spectators attracted by the expectation
of hearing the story of the crime from
the lips of the defendant, together with
the spicy details of her previous life. The
exhibition probably fully equaled their
expectations, but the testimony as given
is unprintable. ''JtffWÃ
Mrs. Regan resumed where she left off
the day before and in answer to questions
put to her by Attorney Long said Ken
nedy had never mentioned Miss Sohr
man's name to her. Kennedy, she said,
came to her house on the evening of Sun
day, January 12, the day before he was
killed. She was in the kitchen preparing
supper. He came up behind her and said:
" 'Liz, I am the biggest in town.'
Then he commenced to cry. He was al
ways crying," continued the witness. "He
sat down by the kitchen table and I went
over and put my arms around him and
asked him what was the matter.
'That â : old hen is continually
throwing her daughter in my way, and
you know the result.'
"I told him to do what was right by
i her. He said he knew he had not treated
me right and when I said that was noth
i ing new he got mad and began to abuse
me and my folks."
Mrs. Regan said Kennedy dried his
! tears and left the house soon after. He
came back the next morning (Monday) at
6or 6:20. She let him-in the hack way and
he took his shoes off in the 'kitchen so
as not to awaken her sister and little
daughter who were sleeping. He went to
bed in McDevitt's room and she returned
to her own bed, where she remained
about fifteen minutes and then arose to
prepare breakfast. After her sister and
daughter had left the house Kennedy
called to her and she went to his room.
He began to abuse her and she left. - A
few minutes later, she thought it was
about 9:30 a. m., she* looked in and he was
sound asleep. Kennedy got up at about
1:30 p. m. and came into the dining room,
where she was, and immediately began
I quarreling.
"Finally he threatened to fill me full of
I holes or full of lead," testified the wit
i ness, "and I said: "You are too big a
I coward to do that. You stood by while a
j brave man was shot (referring to the kill
: ing of Police Lieutenant Burke). That
made him mad and he rushed back into
! McDevitt's room and grabbed his revolv
; er, which was lying on the bureau, and
started toward me. I told him if he came
I at me I would let him have it."
"Have what? What did you mean by
I that?" asked Attorney Barrett,: but the
I witness could not give a lucid explanation
' of the meaning, of the phrase as used by
i her. .*""'â¢ x. /â â¢**.;
! She then described how she grabbed the
! pistol and wrestled around the room with
Kennedy, overturning chairs and- tables.
Her sister, Mrs. Deane, came In and she
'cried:' v -"'.-'.'.
"For God's sake, Annie, come and help
me; Kennedy Is killing me." â 
Annie ran over to the house of Mrs.
' Johnson.** another sister, and .told her
| what was going on. Mrs. Johnson came
Into the house and said something which
Mrs. Regan said she did not understand.
Just then the pistol -was discharged and
Kennedy fell to the floor.
"I saw blood flowing from his mouth,"
said the witness, "and. wiped it away. I
got a pillow and put it under his head and
told McDevitt for God's sake to go for a
doctor."
McDevitt had returned home a few min
utes before the beginning of the row and
retired at once. Mrs. Regan said she was
badly bruised in the struggle with Ken
nedy, her dress nearly- torn off and her
hair pulled down. She was subjected to
a rigid cross-examination at the after
noon session, but beyond an unparalleled
exhibition of how depraved human be
ings can become in their daily life nothing
new was developed. Mrs. Regan could
not be trapped into any material contra
diction. She will go on the stand again
at 1:30 p. m. to-day.

ADOLPH SCHMID
SUCCUMBS TO
HIS INJURIES
Two Suspects in the
City Prison.
DECLARE THEIR INNOCENCE
VICTIM ACCUSES THEM WITH
HIS LAST BREATH.
But No Ante-Mortem Statement Was
Taken and the Alleged Mur
derers Could Not Be Posi
tively Identified. , J
Adolph Schmid, the ex-convict, who was
' hacked with an ax in his room at 815
Stockton street Saturday . morning, died
at the City and County Hospital yester
day morning and his body was removed to
the Morgue.'
The police have in the "tanks" two men
who are detained on suspicion of being
directly or indirectly concerned ln
Schmid's murder. They are Al C. Flan
.ders, master of the tug Millie, and Charles
Forrest, an ex-convict. Forrest was ar
rested on Monday, and Flanders was cap
tured on "Wednesday night at his resi
dence, 718 Bay street. The two men were
taken to the City and County Hospital
by Detectives Gibson, Wren, Dinan and
McMahon Wednesuay night for the pur
pose of being identified by Schmid. He
was delirious and was unable to open his
eyes. He appeared to recognize Flan-
ders' voice, but nothing* intelligible could
be got out of him.
Flanders and Forrest were arrested
on a statement made by Schmid to a
friend, also an ex-convict, who was sent
to talk to him by the police. He had re
fused to tell the police who attacked him,
and they had to resort to strategy in an
effort to get at the facts. Schmid told
his friend that Flanders had called at
his room Saturday morning and after
talking* with him for a few minutes left.
Almost immediately after two men, one
of them Forrest, came into his room and
attacked him with an ax. He believed
Flanders had sent the men there to kill
him. The reason he gave was that Flan
ders should have been sent to San Quen
tin instead of him for the crime he was
charged with. When he was sent to the
penitentiary . he had left with Flanders
a trunk containing his clothing, papers
and some articles of jewelry. After his
discharge he went to Flanders for his
trunk and It was empty, except for a few
papers. He took away the empty trunk
and the next day called upon Mrs. Flan
ders, and told her that her husband vas
an ex-convict and had been the means of
sending him to San Quentin.
Schmid also told the physician who at
tended him at the hospital and his nurse
that Flanders and Forrest and an un
known man were the men who hacKed
him with the ax, and he told the same
story to Detective Wren. Unfortunately
an ante-mortem statement was not taken,
and without It Schmld's statement is not
worth much.
Flanders said yesterday that Schmld's
accusation, as far as he was concerned,
was untrue, and he could easily prove an
alibi. He had not seen Schmid for at
least two months. At the time Schmid
was arresed about seven years ag*o for
robbing a sailor he tried to fix the blame
upon Flanders and the latter was arrest
ed and detained in prison for a day.
That was the only time he was ever ar
rested. He had only known Schmid for a
month. Schmid left his trunk with him,
but it only, contained an old Prince Albert
coat, a vest and a suit of underclothing,
besides a bundle of letters. Flanders
gave the old clothes away.
Schmid took away the trunk and two
weeks later, when Flanders again saw
Schmid, he accused him of telling his wife
that he (Flanders) was an ex-convict.
Schmid denied it and said it must have
been another named named Dunderro.
Since then Flanders had not spoken to
him. ' " 'â  â¢â  :Â»-*'-*â â¢-;-
Flanders said that his wife was con
stantly nagging him about being an ex
convict and he came to the conclusion
that Schmid had been poisoning her mind
against him. â¢ Mrs. Flanders was inter
rogated by the police yesterday, but she
denied that Schmid had ever spoken to
her about her husband being an ex-con
vict. *
Forrest is equally emphatic in his de
nail. He says he had not seen Schmid
for two weeks previous to last Saturday,
and he had not seen Flanders tor six
years till "Wednesday evening. Saturday
last he was at work in. a barber shop on
Fourth street, near Bryant, and could
easily prove an alibi.
The detectives are still working on the
case, but have been unable to find any
trace of the ax. The inquest will be held
this morning.

which caused fresh fears for the winter plant
started wheat strong. May opened %c to %c
higher, at **3*|(573%c,. touched 73V. then pro
ceeded to modify the bullishness, with which it
began. Apart from the weather considerations,
the early nevw was by no means striking and 1
even in that respect the Price Current made
somewhat llfdit of the supposed damage re
marking that late sown wheat was doubtless
more or less damaged, but otherwise the out
look was utill promising.
j Liverpool was firm, while on the other hand
' Paris reported a sharp decline In February i
wheat and unchanged for later deliveries. I
1 Local Interests were persistently against the
advance, and alter touching 73% c near the start
May -sold. down, to 72% c. At that point, how- I
ever, the market began to show considerable
: strength, as the West and Southwest continued
I to send reports of a serious damage to the win
, ter plant. May rose quickly to 74' .'. Realiz
es , set - n and - May declined to 73% c, closing at
that figure.
Under free delivery, free offers by several
prominent houses which met a slow' demand
corn developed a lower tendency. May closed
a shade lower. â¢
In the absence of any sort of independent
market, oats followed corn, leaving off with a
slight loss.
A good export demand for hogs and higher
prices at the yards started provisions strong.
The market subsequently eased off", however,

AN OFF DAY AT INGLESIDE
. BUCKWA WON THE HANDICAP
VERY EASILY.
Adolph Spreckels Looms Up as a
Crackajackâ The Bachelor Beaten
â . by Lodestar Spots and
Queer Angles.
/â¢Ed Corrigran, the big Chicago turfman,
'Is passing many pleasant hours in Cali
. forn.ia this winter. What he says "goes"
at Ingleslde. and his horses, are getting
â¢;the lion's share of everything in sight.
'The hurdle affairs, the most disgraceful
â ..j^bs that ever graced a race
track, and which are rapidly caus
ing the sport in California . to
..fall into disrepute, tickle the . fancy
.of the Hawthorne horseman, and continue
;.. to find a place on the card at the local
. -track. Yesterday six events were run off,
â and horses from the Corrigan barn cap
â¢ tured four of them. Two of the best num.
â¢ b'ers were declared off. and the sport was
below the average. Favorites were thrice
successful.
. The seven-furlong handicap was only a
. gallop for Buckwa. The big gelding was
â¢ a 1 to 2 chance and won with plenty to
â â  spare from Highland Ball.
. â¢ Of the original eighteen entries in the
â¢ opening sprint at six furlongs. 4 eleven
â¢ faced the Darrier. Credo, the Corrigan
entry, was heavily backed, and with a
â  trifle shaking up in the stretch' overtook
and downed Eaklns handily. The 11 to 5
favorite The Wooer was sent away back
â¢In the bunch, and Martin then took him
' up. The race had all the appearance of
a "shoo in."'
â¢ Old Ferrier with one or two live ones to
beat annexed the second purse. At one
â time as good as 10 to 1 in the ring. Bull
man. who had the mount, was away well,
' and. catching Midlight the " last few
strides, won by the shortest of heads. Op
ponent was a sluggish third. Don't Skip
'Me the favorite, also started.
â  The mile and a sixteenth run was a
â¢speckled looking affair. Adolph Spreck
els. the Corrigan entry, had an immense
' following for some reason, and at odds
of 3 to 1 waltzed in. In a mild and te
â¢ dious drive. Spencer, astride Dr. Bernays,
â  .finished second, a head before Mistral 11.
. The fourth event was declared off and a
mile and a furlong selling run substi
tuted. The "innocents" all got aboard
The Bachelor and were massacred. Mar
tin was at the helm and, taking the Cor
rigan entry out of it. came with a grand
â¢ stand rush at the wire, nearly a length
behind Lodestar, the- second choice. For
mella was third.
. The last race which was also declared
off, was replaced with a six furlong spin.
Maxello, from the Corrigan string, was
thrown in with a cheap lot of "skates"
and made a show of his field. Una Colo
â¢rado took the place from Naranja.

JOHNSON FIGHTS
FOR THE BANKS
Grovel Makes a *â¢" Lonesome
Stand. Against Mnen
ter's Bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 9.â Evidently Grovel John
son is also attorney for a bank. ; The
single-handed and bitter fight he waged in
the Assembly to-day against Assembly
bill 206, by Muenter of San Joaquin, can
be explained by no other hypothesis, nor
can his previous policy regarding that
measure. .'A*
Mr. Muenter's bill is designed to throw
one more safeguard around those people
who trust their earnings- to the savings
banks and also to compel banking institu
tions to render each year to the Assessor
true statements of their assets that they
may be taxed accordingly.
Like the law now in force, Muenter's
bill provides that on- or before the first
day of April of each year every banker
shall file with the Bank Commissioners a
true statement of the bank's finances, but
it adds a proviso that the statement shall
be verified by a majority of the board of
directors as to the correctness of the
statement made by the principal officers
and as to the value of assets therein set
forth. The bill further requires that the
Bank Comlsslon's report shall be made
out at 12 o'clock noon on the first day of
March of each year and at the same time
a similar statement must be made out for
the Assessor of the county in which the
bank does business.
As was expected, Mr. Muenter s bill has
won the opposition of the banks. The
average director would rather not verify
his bank's annual statement. He would
also rather not make out the list for the
Bank Commission and Assessor at the
same time for palpable reasons, and to
avoid being compelled to do so a fight
on Muenter's bill was ordered.
Early In the present week Grovel John
son got his instructions from his bank
ing clients in San Francisco. He re
ceived a telegram instructing him to have
the bill held back on the file for four or
five days. He took it at once to C. L.
Ortman. Assessor of San Joaquin County,
who is working hard to get the bill
through, and together they went . to As
semblyman Conrey, chairman of the Com
mittee on Commissions and I Public Ex
penditures. Mr. Conrey said he could not
understand why so much time was want
ed and he told Johnson to have his peo
ple on hand, the next: day or not at all.
Johnson talked the matter over with Ort
man and tried to induce him tp have tho
clause concerning the. verification by
directors cut * out and he intimated that
the bill would not pass unless this was
done To save the rest of his bill Mr.
Ortman - practically * consented to the
amendment Johnson wanted and that pe
culiar legislator Immediately wired his
San Francisco clients to be on hand next
day â¢â ---.*-.
A telegram came instead, telling John
son that Ed H. Hamilton, cashier of the
Sacramento Savings Bank, would appear
for the banks. At the committee meet
in**: that evening both Johnson and Hamil
ton were present and so were Mr. Muen
ter and Mr. Ortman. Hamilton told the
committee that the only objection the
banks had- to the bill was the director
clause * He was asked if it would incon
venience a bank to close up during the
noon hour of the first Monday in March to
prepare its statement.
He replied: -"Well. I will tell you hon
estly It would not, and no honest bank
would fail to do It." The bill was "at once
recommended to pass. ,'_'__ . â¢-,
Ortman and Muenter fancied that John
son's opposition would be withdrawn after
Hamilton's friendliness, but when' the bill
"came up on the second reading file to-day
they were undeceived. â¢ .; -
Despite that Hamilton - had said "no
honest bank"' would fail to make its re
port and have 'it - verified on the pre
scribed day, Johnson got out on the floor
to beat the very clauses that would com
pel either honest or dishonest banks .to
do that very thing. He wanted the entire
clause concerning directors cut out. and
he wanted to amend further by cutting
out the words "at 12 o'clock meridian." ;.
- Valentine of Los Angeles i took the floor
In "defense -of the measure and said that
Johnson's proposed amendments would
cvt * out ' the â greatest safeguards â¢ the . bill
contained. . â .* V , .
Johnson, -however, * insisted, and pursu
ing his usual course tried to handle not
only his own vote but every other vote on
the" floor. - That he was not as strong as
he was before The Call exposed his legis
lative methods was impressed upon him
savory part of the city; a stranger
would be loath to believe it. John and
Charlie walk hand-in-hand down the nar
row streets and stop and Btare at each
new object like a couple of country boys
paving their first visit to a circus. - And
when "John" ogles anything, whether it
be a particularly choice bit of the por
tion of a pig a white man would throw
away or if it is a lady with baby-size
feet and an incredible quantity of vermil
ion paint on her lips, he, is. a sight for.
gods and men to see and wonder at.
You may meet him on the street any
when his amendments were voted upon
and both of them killed.
â¢ Mr. Muenter's bill went to its engross
ment and third reading, with only the op
position of Grovel and Le Barron".
BURNS GIVES THE
STATE A SETBACK
Candelaria Bullion Brought
Here and Shipped North
for Reduction.
Colonel Daniel M. Burns has little
love for California. To be sure, the
Mexican mine jumper condescends to
manipulate politics for the people of
the State and he is willing to be sent
to the United States Senate, but be
yond that Colonel Burns does not care
a farthing for the commonwealth or
the inhabitants thereof. *
Small : wonder, then,' that Burns
should Ignore the California smelters
and send the bullion from his unlaw
fully usurped Mexican mine way up to
Everett, Wash., for reduction. That
is what he does, paying the cost of
extra transportation from San Fran
cisco to Puget Sound, rather than pat
ronize local smelters.
Last Sunday the Pacific Coast steam
ship Curacao arrived from Guaymas
and other Mexican ports, and amon*?
her cargo were thirty-five bars of sil
ver bullion from the Candelaria mine,
valued at $28,000, which were shipped
by the Candelaria Mining Company
from Mazatlan. This bullion has been
transferred to the steamer Walla
Walla, which sails for Puget Sound

ports this morning, and will be taken
to Everett for reduction. The Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's boats are
not operated for the health of its di
rectors and stockholders, consequently
the freight bill on these thirty-five bars
of bullion from here north will amount
to a tidy sum, but Colonel Burns is sat
isfied to pay it rather than , give the
bullion to Californians to smelt.
This has been going on right along,
and it is a curious fact that while Col
onel Burns finds it convenient to send
his bullion to Puget Sound. British Co.
lumbia and other northern mine-own
ers have discovered that it is to* their
advantage to have their bullion sent
down here for treatment. The Walla
Walla on her last trip down brought
four carloads of ore for reduction
which, it was estimated, would yield
1200 to 14.00 ounces of silver and about
12,000 pounds of lead.'
And Colonel Burns is anxious to rep
resent California in the United State-
Senate!

NOW ON TRIAL
FOR THE MURDER
OF HIS CHILD
Brandes Shows Signs
of Weakness.
OPENING STATEMENT STINGS
..WITNESS STBEIGHTIF MAKES
... â¢ AN IMPORTANT DENIAL.
. Case May Hinge on Expert Medical
. ' Testimony â Eleven Physicians
Will Be Examined as to
Cause of Death.
;.'* â¢_:' ' Oakland Offlce San Franlcsco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 9.
â¢With the beginning to-day of the tak
â¢ ing of testimony in the trial of William
â  A, Brandes, charged with cruelly beating
id. death his thirteen-year-old daughter
Lillian, the prisoner showed symptoms of
â¢a. realization of the fact that he is now
..on trial for his life. -
..tVhile District Attorney Allen delivered
/his opening statement to the jury in Judge
â¢Hall's court this afternoon, Brandes ap
â¢peareid to be cowering down in his chair.
.â¢"the prosecution rehearsed briefly the tes
timony adduced at the preliminary ex
â  amination. He recited the facts that the
autopsy held over Lillian's remains show
"- ed marks of violence that refuted the
â statement of the accused father that the
gI.H- had hanged herself. The Coroner's
jury believed that death was due to in
juries inflicted on the head with a smooth,
blunt, -flexible instrument, and that pre
...vioUsto her death the girl had been heard
to-, exclaim: "Oh, Al, Al, please don't. I
-.did* not take the money." Furthermore
â¢.that Brandes had made dire threats
against her on account of her behavior.
- â¢".â¢The defense hopes to establish Brandes'
:; in-nqcence almost wholly through medical
expert testimony to the effect that the I
girl did not die from the blows inflicted on
â â 'her. head. Eleven physicians will testify,
namely: Drs. J. S. Eastman. F. H. Payne.
JJo* ow c - I'_Geor1 '_ Geor^ c M. Whitworth and
G-. 8.-Hoagland. Berkeley physicians, who
were present with Drs - S. H. Buteau and
â¢ J. ...AL: .{shannon at the autopsy over the
remains of Lillian Brandes, will support
the. prosecution. Dr. E. H. Woolsey
who,* with Attorney Bennett of the
defense, removed the skull of the
murdered girl just prior to the
funeral, will testify that the autopsy
"â¢ physicians were mistaken in their conclu
sions.; The other medical experts will be
Drs,. Henry Ryfkogel, O. D. Hamlin and '
A._ H. Pratt for the defense.

ANGRY PARENT
Dr. J. S. Green's En

OPPOSE THE MATCH.
The Bride-to-Be and Mrs. Green Use
Angry Words, While the Doc
tor Enjoys Peace at
i - Sea.
7~~ ' -
ALAMEDA, Feb. 9.â An Innocent notice
of the engagement of Dr. J. S. Green and
Miss Amanda Roebke, which appeared
yesterday, has started a social war be
tween the families of the physician and
his alleged intended. Mrs. S. S. Green,
mother of the doctor, says her son Is not
engaged to Miss Roebke; that he has no
Intention of getting married, and that
even if he has he is too young to assume
the responsibilities of a husband.
Miss Roebke insists with all the em
phasis possible that she is engaged to Dr.
Green, and furthermore that she intends
to marry the man of her choice or will
know the reason why. The man in the
case is on the high seas, on his way to
Acapulco, where he will assume the po
sition of surgeon of the steamer City of
Panama.
Dr. Green has but recently reached his
majority. He and Miss Roebke have been
keeping company for some time, in de
fiance of the wishes of the young medico's
parents, the principal opposition on their
part being a question of religion. The
engagement was not made public until
after the steamer upon which Green was
a passenger had passed beyond the Golden
Gate, and then Miss Roebke herself an
nounced to the world that she was to be
the bride of Dr. J. S. Green.
This was the first intimation the doc
! tor's parents had that he nad disobeyed
r their commands, and in the absence of a
statement from him they flatly deny that,
he has plighted his faith to Miss Roebke.
"The last words my son told me before
he left on the steamer were that he was
not engaged to that girl," said Mrs. S. S.
Green. "He intimated that we would hear
all kinds of stories, but told me not to pay
any attention to them. Why. he is too
young to think of marrying, and besides
he could not support a wife. He Is only
21. and has just graduated from medical
college.
"Her family circulated the statement
some weeks ago that they were to be mar
ried as soon as he graduated, but I
nipped that little scheme in the bud and
.made him promise not to have anything
more to do with the girl."
Miss Roebke is not at all alarmed at the
attitude of Dr. Green's parents, and as
serts that it will not be possible for them
to prevent the wedding.
"The doctor and I have been engaged
for some time and have made no 'effort
to conceal the fact," said the young lady,
I "but his parents have opposed the match.
They have nothing in particular against
! me "excepting that I am a Christian and
j they belong to the Jewish faith. .On that
' account they have done everything pos
sible to get him to give me up, but I
know that he loves me and I adore him
and as the children say, 'Nobody can cut
our love in two.' ; * ~kxx
"We agreed not to publish our engage
ment notice until after he sailed for
Acapulco. He said his old folks would
raise a row about it and he wanted to be
out of the way of a scolding. Dr. Green
will probably be gone five or six weeks, as
his steamer piles between Panama and
Acapulco. When he returns, if he thinks
there is no danger from fever, he will
take me back with him."
Miss Roebke is a handsome brunette and
has a wide circle of admirers. The notice
of the engagement was not a surprise to
the friends of the young people.

OAKLAND, Feb. 9.â A mysterious wom
an who travels frequently on the ferry
boat Garden City by the creek route be
tween this city and San Francisco caused
considerable fear and annoyance to Cap
tain . Fredericks and Mate Hogan. Last
night she came over on the 6 o'clock boat.
It was cold and windy, and the few pas
sengers that were on board sought shel
tered seats and left the upper deck solely
to the mysterious woman. As soon as she
came aboard Captain Fredericks said to
the mate: .;7:'V^\'|K^.'A\''
"Here she comes again; I wish she
would travel by some other boat."
Asked for an explanation, he said that
the woman is always acting in a most pe
culiar manner. She carries a revolver,
and sometimes is not slow in producing it.
Barely had the captain made these re
marks than he exclaimed: - ,
"There she goes again," and the woman
with a pistol in her hand was seen run
ning to and fro on the deserted deck,
threatening to shoot everybody â  who
was in sight and sending sundry
threats in the direction of the captain.
Mate Hogan was on the lower deck: and
said that he had no desire to meet the
lady; he hoped that she was not anything
more criminal than demented, but said
he heartily wished she would cease pa
tronizing the Garden City.
No one anpeared anxious to arrest the
woman, and when the boat arrived at the
slip all were so glad to see the last of her
that they made no effort to follow her or
to ascertain her identity. * :â'- :

The Gallant Gentlemen Declare That
No Young Lady Was Tipsyâ , "-.
That She Merely Slipped
on the Floor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
;.'.-V. 908 Broadway, Feb. 9.
After being entertained' by ladies for a
long time the gentlemen In Oakland so
ciety have at last repaid a small portion
of their indebtedness. They have given
a cotillon in honor of the ladies, and the
affair was particularly interesting in that
the punch-bowl was conspicuous by Its
absence. This incident has caused much
comment and some explanation.
Dr. J. P. H. Dunn, the handsome
Health Officer of this city, and who is ab
solutely Irresistible in his uniform of sur
geon major of the National Guard, has
made an explanation of the punch-bowl,
of its absence from the gentlemen's co
tillon and of the incident that led to the
recent disturbance in society caUsed by
the effects of said punch-bowl on a cer
tain young lady.
"There was no punch-bowl." said the
doctor, "and that is all that can be said,
It wasn't there, so we can't talk about it.
Nobody appeared to miss, it, and being
somewhat of a bud myself, and as this
was the first of these annual gentlemen's
cotillons that I took part in, I cannot say
whether Its absence differed from the
customs of previous cotillons or not."
Then the gallant surgeon major ex
plained the little incident that shook so
ciety two weeks ago. "It is preposter
ous," he said, "that a young lady in so
ciety should take too much punch. The
affair was not understood. The young
lady in one of the figures of the german,
resembling a whip, was on the end of the
line, and fell to the floor rather heavily.
She sought to pass the incident off by
laughing heartily. Just one unchar
itable attendant at that ball saw the whole
thing, misconstrued it, hurt the young
lady's feelings, slashed at society * right
and left and brought the punch-bowl Into
question."
That is allâ Dr. Dunn says so.
Charles D. Bates, another "bud" of the
gentlemen's annual cotillon, says that the
punch used by society at the young lady's
dances is the most harmless thing in the
world. It is merely lemonade, colored by
a little claret. "Circus lemonade, if you
will, quoth he, "and it wouldn't affect
anybody If she drank the whole bowlful."
lhe incident has caused trouble for Mr
Bates. Tuesday afternoon a young lady
from Berkeley called on his wife anxious
to find out the name of the young lady
vaguely hinted at as being the victim of
the punch-bowl. And so it goes on, but
I the punch-bowl has disappeared, never
j theless, -â â â ..- â â  â  - . â â ' .
TO DETERMINE THE

Will Assist ; Board of Supervisors in

ide as a Disease Producer.
Some excellent results are anticipated
from the recent appointment of F. Hoke
weg as chemical expert to the Finance
Committee of the Board, of Supervisors.
Chairman Perrault realized the necessity
of a practical man to help, the board to a
proper solution of the gas rate question,
and succeeded in having Mr. Hokeweg ap
pointed to the position. He has made an
exhaustive inquiry into the subject and
has collected a mass of valuable data and
statistics which will, materially aid the
board in fixing the rates. .
; It is necessary to determine the quality
of the gas in order to arrive at the cost
of its manufacture, and this Mr. Hoke
weg is j now Investigating.' In this con
nection the presence of carbon monoxide
in- gas figures extensively. From 5 to
L Jt er â C 1?? t * .of , th,s .Poisonous element
Is , the limit of safety allowed by law. -Gas
with that amount is the product of coal
only, while water gas contains from 30
to 1?, per cent; half water gas., from 17
to 23 per cent, and generated gas con
tains as high as 50 per cent.. of the deadly
compound.
Aside from the : numerous i asphyxiations
resulting. from, inhalation of gas in this
city, Expert Hokeweg has discovered that
carbon monoxide will produce certain dis
eases. It is slow and insidious in its ac
tion and produces locomotor ataxia and
other forms of spinal paralysis, - anaemia
or an impoverished condition of the blood,
diseases of the eye and Innumerable nerv
ous affections. It is Mr. Hokeweg's in
tention, backed by the Board of â¢ Super
visors, to take precautions to lessen, the
possibilities of danger from this source.
He will recommend safeguards as to leak
ages which have been adopted in Ger
many and other Continental countries and
known r^. Muhlbach's regulator.* : This
consists in j passing the gas through a
glass bulb partly filled with water. . The
regulator will be placed-- in hotels and
large lodging houses, and deaths by in
halation of the poisonous fumes will be
a thing of the past.
The result of Mr. Hokeweg's. investiga
tions will be eagerly awaited and neces
sary reforms in the manufacture of | illu
minating gas are sure â¢to be Inaugurated.

ALL MUST BE PUT THROUGH
NICARAGUA CANAL BILL AT A
STANDSTILL.
The President Is Anxious to Have
the Army Reorganized at the
Earliest Moment V
Possible.
Special Dispatch ,to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.-Although
Senator Morgan is willing to accept
Hepburn's Nicaragua canal bill - re
ported by the House Committee on
Interstate j and Foreign Commerce, he
realizes that the opposition of Speaker
Reed must be overcome by . hook or
crook, and he proposes to do it by crook
rather than have no bill at all. But
neither Chairman Fry c of -the Com
merce Committee of the Senate, which
has Jurisdiction over river and harbor
appropriations', nor Chairman Burton
of the House Committee on Rivers and
Harbors take kindly to the proposed
scheme of attaching the Nicaragua
measure to the river and harbor bill.
It begins to look as if there might be
an extra session after all. The regu
lar appropriation bills are not only un
usually delayed, but important mea
sures, such as the Hanna-Pavne steam
ship subsidy bill, army reorganization
and the anti-scalping bills have yet to
be acted upon. Senator Hanna is very
anxious about the shipping subsidy
measure, and unless it passes at this
session he will doubtless endeavor to
persuade President McKinley to con
vene Congress in extra session soon
after March 4.
Owing to the opposition to the army
reorganization bill that has been de
veloped in the Senate, the supporters
of that measure have almost aban
doned all hope of securing its passage
at this session. The failure of - the
army bill will, it is said, of itself be
considered by the President as suffi
cient cause for calling an: extra ses-*
sion.
Senator Hanna believes the inhabit
ants of the Hawaiian Islands can man
age to get along under existing ar
rangements without much trouble, but
he thinks there is an immediate neces
sity for the passage of the Nicaragua
canal bill and his subsidy measure, and
as neither is likely to pass at the pres
ent session, it is safe to assume that
the influence Senator Hanna is sup
posed to have with the President will
be exerted in favor of an extra session
next spring.
There was considerable talk at the
Capitol to-day to the effect that the
anti-expansionists in the Senate intend
to prevent the appropriation of the
$20,000,000 indesmnity to Spain stipu
lated for in the peace treaty. The anti
expansionists, it is understood, believe
they can in this way accomplish what
they hoped to do if they had prevented
the ratification of the treaty.
The Interesting: information comes
from Madrid that the Spanish Cortes
will not ratify the treaty until our
Government appropriates the $20,000,
--000 which Spain is to receive. By an
tagonizing this item in the sundry
civil appropriation bill | the anti-expan
sionists think that they can accomplish
their purpose, as the failure of the Cor
tes to ratify the treaty would render it
still inoperative.
"If necessary," said an anti-expan
sion Senator to-day, "we will filibuster
against the appropriation. "We do not
intend that the money shall be appro
priated this session. The time remain
ing of the present session is so short
that it will be comparatively an easy
matter to kill the $20,000,000 item by re
sorting to dilatory tactics." : V / .-
POSTOFFICE BUILDING
PLANS -ARE CRITICIZED
Senator Perkins Roasts Supervising
Architect Taylor of the
Treasury. ."' :'
WASHINGTON, Feb. Perkins roast
ed the Supervising Architect of the Treas
ury in the Senate to-day by severely crit
icizing the design for the San Francisco
new public building. ':. He was equipped
with a blue-print photograph of that ar
chitectural, monstrosity, and held it up to
the view of brother Senators. Perkins'
attack was actuated by the refusal *of
Architect : Taylor to modify; the plans at
Perkins* suggestion and at the suggestion
of Federal Judges in San Francisco. Ten
days ago Taylor informed . Perkins that
no further changes would be made. . How
ever, in view of the adverse criticism of
the design, which was quite generally ex
pressed by Senators to-day, it may be
that he will change his mind. The plans
have been * changed . three times, but all
who have seen photos of the latest agree
that it is the worst. of the three.
Mr. Perkins said that the San Francisco
people were indignant that an attempt
should be made to force them to accept a
building that did -not comport with other
structures in the city.' ,â 
. "It : looks like ; a cotton ". factory," com
mented Tillman.
' "Why." said Perkins, "our jail in San
Francisco is a -^leasing picture compared
to that."
GAMBETTA'S BODY FOUND.
Probably Committed Suicide While
Despondent Over the Loss
of Money. r *
-. NOVATO, Feb. The mystery of the
disappearance', of the farm hand, Peter
Gambetta; was cleared up to-day by the
discovery of the body of the missing man
in Novato creek, near the railway draw
bridge, 1 about -a mile from town. The
body was first . perceived ;â¢ where -. it had
washed up on the bank by some employes
of the railroad, who notified -Joe Gam
betta, a brother. Coroner Eden was sum
moned from San Rafael, and an Inquest
held this afternoon. The evidence showed
that Gambetta â  was despondent * over . the
theft "of $55. his savings, of; several
months. . He rose from ; the â  supper * table
and left the house on the evening of Jan
uary 6, and was not seen again until the
body was found. The verdict of ' the jury
was that deceased came -.to his death; by
drowning. Everything goes to show, and
the townspeople, with not a single excep
tion, believe that ; Gambetta committed
suicide through despondency, v- *

ARCHITECT CRITICIZED.
Delay in Public Buildings Alluded
To by Senators.
WASHINGTON, Feb. Throughout its
open session ".. to-day the ' Senate had un
der consideration the legislative, execu
tive and judicial appropriation bill. i'A
lively debate was precipitated over the
appropriation for the support of the of
fice of the Supervising : Architect of the
Treasury, and that official was criticized
for the delay in the construction of public
buildings throughout the United States.
A speech made by Allen, in which he
commented unfavorably upon the meth
ods of the Appropriation Committee, in
duced a rejoinder from Chandler of New
Hampshire, which resulted in a sharp tilt
between the two Senators.
Fifty-one pages of the pending bill were
disposed of before the Senate went into
executive session r for the - remainder of
the day.

- â 
The Directors Are Anxious to Have
the Question of Life-Tenure :
to Teachers' Positions
Finally. Decided.
. â  - *
When School Superintendent Webster
Btraightened out the unassigned lists and
got the dismissed teachers down to a
.philosophical acceptance of their fate he
â¢thought the hardest' part of his task was
â¢done. For four weeks he has labored in
Â his office and at the schools on an aver
. age of. eighteen hours a day. While' he,
'With his deputies and typewriters, has
â¢ been arranging names, dates and changes
in the heavy work of reclassification, his
anterooms have been crowded with com
plaining teachers,- protesting citizens and
â¢ information seekers. Added to this his
: desk telephone has been ringing day and
.night almost without intermission. He
could close his door and insist on all vis
itors taking their turn, but he could make
. 'no office rule that would shut out the tele
phone. A teacher weary of waiting would
r seek the nearest station and ring him up,
and the : insistent bell would soon bring
-. him to terms.
;. Whatever : Mr. Webster's sins in being
. -the" heavy' Instigator of the revolution
. that*, has upheaved the 'department, a
â¢ spirit of unfailing courtesy has possessed
him through all the trying interviews,
' explanations and expostulations. This to
the credit of the man:'
However, the revising of the substitutes,
unassigned and dismissed, did not finish
â¢ the work. The straightening out of the
regular teachers, the remaining schools
and classes was to be Inaugurated. This
: labor is now under way, and has proven
to be no small task. Principals and as
sistant principals long secure in their po
sitions cannot understand- why their
schools should be "interfered with," as
â they term it. Clouds of reasons have
â¢ emanated from this heretofore privileged
class why their staff of teachers should
â¢ not be cut down. In some cases they have
â¢ reluctantly complied with peremptory or
ders from the board, and in others they
"have professed to misunderstand instruc
tions.
. An old teacher with a life tenure to
â  his job may be pardoned if he is slightly j
above boards of education. He cannot
be degraded or dismissed without statu
tory reasons, of which Insubordination is'
not one, and any. suit he may bring will â 
outlive the board. . The present- heads of I
the department have met several educa- j
tors that in this respect overtopped them,
and a quiet little war Is on in conse- j
â quence. It ls not the purpose of this !
article to single out the gentler sex as |
the greatest insubordinates, but from the
statement of a department official the
lady principals and other teachers of that j
gender most solid in San Francisco *
schooldom are the hardest to manage.
They are without the radius of reason ;
and hold on like grim death to their an
cient privileges.. " - â¢
â¢ To discipline tnese supposed to be
school disciplinarians is the new task of
the board. This official body is anxious
lo test the question of life tenure in the
department and take from the school sys
tem of this city its eleemosynary charac
ter. As a preliminary a few little evils ;
â¢have been sponged away. There are; no >
more superfluous teachers, acting as '
â¢mere . clerks to principals. No teacher
â¢will instruct minutes per diem and
.'get paid for a full month. Soft little mon
itor jobs. in school yards have been abol
ished, classless teachers have become cor
respondingly salaryless. And the rod ln
pi'oKle tor the principals themselves is
the complete change in their personnel
â¢ arid pay. The cut in salaries of the ,Poly
technic is a beginning, and such work
will go merrily down the line. - Already
more than $5000 per month has been saved,
md after a while a still larger sum will
â¢ remain in the fund from these economies
each month. It is estimated that this j
-.saving per year will just pay one month's ]
. salary.
'* For the ensuing half year the Building
'Committee must worry along with $5000
a- month. . In such a deplorable condition
are the schoolhouses of this city that
' twice this sum is needed, but cannot be
spared. The building force consists of
.eight carpenters, two painters; and, with
the superintendent, seventeen, persons all
told. The former board raised this force
to thirty-seven. These seventeen work
men will patch a little and paint a little
â when absolutely necessary.
. To-day Auditor Wells may be relieved
of a portion of his burden and the Janu
ary teachers of some anxiety. In all prob
ability Judge Seawell will exempt the
salaries of last month from the $113,000
indebtedness, and let that deficit rest on
November-December pay. Mr. Wells will
then settle for January, notwithstanding
that General Dickinson, his attorney, has
strongly advised him that he cannot in
any case do so. ,
Attorneys Pierce and Henley are pre
paring the papers in three cases brought
by eighteen dismissed teachers. The first
Is that of a substitute, the second a pro
bationary and the third of* a regular, all
of whom claim they were unlawfully de
prived of their positions in the School De
partment. These will be test cases, and
upon them will hang the fate of ail the
dismissed teachers. v
'. Yesterday morning, when Superintend
. ent Webster took up the matter of E. C. j
"Kilpatrick,' ex-principal of the Business
Evening School, with a view of reinstat
ing him in his old position, he learned
that the board. in ordering the with
drawal of the' appeal against Kilpatrick,
had not fully settled' the question. : While
"the present board is disposed to revoke
the acts of its predecessor, it will prob
ably order a rehearing of the case before
deciding and ending the matter. 'Then G.
â¢H. Foulks, the present principal of the
school, who has been active in pressing
.the charges against Kilpatrick, will be in
vited to repeat his statements.

BASEBALL MEETING.
Schedule of Games for the Coming
. Season.
.* That baseball' is destined to boom once
more was made manifest last night at an
enthusiastic meeting held in the office of
Attorney Eugene Bert. Representatives
from the six towns forming the league
we're in 'attendance, and J. T. Moran of
Oakland presided.
The schedule committee presented . a
schedule of games for the season, to
which objections were made by certain
clubs as to the holiday dates. The mat
ter was amicably adjusted and the sched
ule was adopted in Its amended form.
The schedule contemplates a total of
eighty-five games. Each team will play
eighteen at home and a similar number
away from home. Each team will also
meet an equal number of 'times* during
the season of eighteen weeks. There will
be Saturday games in the country towns,
an innovation that is expected to meet
with much, favor. A Sunday morning
game will be played in â  Oakland, and the
same teams will play in San Francisco
In the afternoon. The Spalding ball was
adopted as the league ball.
A dispute has already, arisen .Â»etween
Manager Borchers of San Jose, and Man
ager Strube lof Watsonvllle in , regard to

Want Sixth Street Bituminized.
Since The Call published the intentions
of the Market Street Railroad Company
to place Sixth street in the line of electric
car service, the property owners and mer
chants desire to have the street bitumin
ized from Market to Harrison. It is
claimed by those having property on this
street, as also those doing business there,
that Sixth street is one of the foremost
business streets on the south side of Mar
ket, and consequently is entitled to con
sideration at the hands of the Super
visors. They think the street should be
paved before the new tracks are laid.

DECLARES THE
STATEMENTS
ARE ALL FALSE
Dr. F.B. Robinson Makes
a Hot Denial.
HE DENOUNCES MRS. WREDE
SAYS HE HAS ' BEEN DELIBER
ATELY SLANDERED.
Did Not Threaten Her Life - With a
Dirk Claims * His *â¢' Relations
With â¢* the p Daughter
Were Proper.
Dr. F. B. Robinson makes a most em
phatic denial '"'of "-the allegations made
against him by Mrs. Meta Wrede, par
ticularly with reference to the statement
that he had -threatened her life, and as
to his relations with, her daughter, Edith
Wrede. Dr. Robinson brands the charges
as "maliciously false," and says he is at
a loss to understand why the : woman
should deliberately pick him out and
make charges . calculated to greatly in
jure his reputation, and which "have no,
foundation in fact."
In speaking of these charges yesterday.
Dr. Robinson related his experiences with
Mrs. Wrede and her family, covering a
period of several years. He said: , ,
"As a result of a quarrel with her
daughter, about two and a half years ago,
Mrs. Wrede went to my father and also
I to my wife and made all kinds of charges
I against me. However, after ascertaining
her character, they would nave nothing
more to do with her. She says a 'stormy
Interview' took place between herself and
me two weeks ago. This is untrue. We
| had a wordy altercation six weeks ago
I at her house,- which was brought on after
she had had a quarrel with her daughter,
I and by my calling and requesting her in
plain language to cease circulating cer
tain false reports about me.
"One word led to another and the dis
cussion finally resulted in my citing cer
tain cold facts regarding her. which,
| though true, were distasteful. Mrs.
i Wrede then ordered me from the house,
I but not having called at her invitation, I
refused to go at* that ' moment. I. how
ever, departed somewhat later, and did
not remain all night, as charged by Mrs.
Wrede. 'â¢'.' _.'â 'â  ....
"The alleged dirk episode, of which the
woman makes so much, was a matter of
vivid imagination, for there is not one
word of truth in it. These are not the
days when gentlemen carry such weapons
and particularly a practicing physician of
good repute. The statement is simply
nonsensical. With reference to the as
sertion that I was the means of breaking
up her household, it is also untrue. As
a matter of fact, it was systematically
broken up by her from the time her hus
band left her. , ' ...
"She further declares that she sold her
furniture the day after the episode in
question. This is also incorrect, and Mrs.
Wrede knows it. She had been selling her
household effects for a long time, and the
remainder of It was disposed of three
weeks after that incident between us, and
has since been living at the Fulton House,
on Larkin street. ; . <;. ' ,
"Another allegation I wish particularly
to deny is that I went to her house 'under
protest.' As late as three days previous to
the date on which she says I threatened j
her life, she requested me to perform an
operation upon her. So much for that.
Furthermore, not only was I the physician
to her husband shortly before and â¢up
to the time of his separation from Mrs.
Wrede. but I have prescribed not alone
for her but for various members of the
family for the past few years.
"This -woman states that during her In
terview with my wife the latter told her
that I had stayed away from my home
empty whisky bottle and a small glass
were lying near him. It is believed that
he took strychnine in the liquor, after
having been on a protracted spree. On
being asked Wednesday by a woman
friend if he had any funds remaining, he
replied: ."I've got money enough to last
until to-morrow, and I won't want any
after that." His last service aboard ship
was on the Edward O'Brien, which he
left November 1 of last year. In an en
velope found on his person were two
bunches of faded flowers. \ reminiscences
evidently of a love affair. - â¢
Berbquist was a Swede, aged 38 years,
and earned his living by playing the ac
cordion. â¢ He was found dead in his room
in the Adelphia House, 909 Kearny street,
about 4 o'clock p. m. - yelterday, - having
bled to death j from razor wounds. "He had
cut both of his wrists and also Tils throat.
He was suffering from \ the j last stages of
consumption, and ;* had become 'so ' weak
that- during the -last three nights of . his
life he had to.be assisted to go upstairs to
his room. ;, Despondency caused by ; this
incurable malady is believed to have led
him to take his life.
several days at a time. This allegation
is most emphatically denied by Mrs. Â« Ro
binson herself. Now it; Is directly de
clared by Mrs. Wrede that the 'alleged
assault was due to her threat to go to my
mother : with stories S about * me. The in
consistency, of this charge .is shown by
the fact â¢ that > the tales i she proposed Sto
carry-were well known to my father and
mother. As I was well aware of this fact,
there was no reason for me to become ex
cited, let alone make threats, against life.
I do not care to say anything of the wom
an's "reputation. It is too well known
to. make that necessary. Her statements
are malicious fabrications, and I can only
brand them as such. If she were respon
sibleâhad propertyâ l would sue her for
slander, but she has nothing left of a
once : splendid property, and therefore
there is no redress for me.' . **
"Finally, the statements she makes
against her. daughter Edith are infamous.
My relations 'to the young woman were
never anything more than that of physi
cian and friend." * . â  - â * " -
LIEUT. COL MILEY
-IS HERE AGAIN
HE HAS BEEN ORDERED TO
PROCEED TO MANILA.
Will Join General Lawton's Staff in
the Philippinesâ Brilliant Ca-
reer of a Brave Soldier.
Lieutenant Colonel John D. J Miley, aid
de camp to General Shafter, who partic
ularly distinguished himself at San Juan,
is at the Palace, having arrived from New
York . yesterday morning. He will pro
ceed to Manila to report to General H. W.
Lawton, who . is going there by way of
the Suez- canal. In the regular army Col
onel Miley is lieutenant' of the Second Ar
tillery and while In Cuba was inspector
general of volunteers. It was rumored
that he will be General Lawton's chief
of staff, but of this Colonel Miley . had
received no official notification.
"I only know," said , Colonel Miley,
LIEUTENANT COLONEL MILEY
! "that my orders were to proceed to the
Philippines by way of San Francisco.
While 1 would be highly gratified to be
favored with the high position, I have no
knowledge of it as yet. I do not think,
however, that I will perform any inspec
tion duty at Manila. . I received my or
ders while at Governor's Island, and just
had time, to pay my respects to General
Lawton before his hurried -departure on
the Grant, and I did not discuss military
subjects with him 'at all. I assure you
that I was glad to be sent by way of this
city, as I formed many pleasant associa
tions during my stay here at the Presidio,
and I was anxious to renew them. Al
though my time is limited, as I sail on
the Coptic . Saturday, I would be glad to
meet all my friends."
Colonel Miley with Captain W. H. Mc-
Kittrick and Lieutenant J. R. Wheeler
raised .the American flag at Santiago, and
he says 'that pulling? on the rope which
hoisted "Old -Glory" was one of the pleas
antest incidents of his life. '
When Colonel Miley was at the Presi
dio no officer, was more popular with the
rank and file than he and his career has
been watched with interest by the San
Francisco public. As a first lieutenant in
the Second United States Artillery he was
assigned to duty on General r Shafter'
staff and - later on : was made lieutenant
colonel of volunteers In recognition of his
efficiency during the war. When the war
ceased he reported to Washington, and his
assignment to General Lawton's staff is
another tribute to his sterling qualities as
a man and soldier.
"KID" M'COY WILL
MEET CHOYNSKI
MANAGER W. A. BRADY AR
RIVED LAST NIGHT. .
Fight Promoter ..Says Fitzsimmons
, and ; Jeffries I Are Practically
' Matched r or a Fight.
i William A. J Brady,' i theatrical I manager
and fight promoter .-.New York, arrived
in this cty last night ; and went to the
Palace. â¢ He had a pocketful of telegrams,
all relating to fisticuffs and to. the coming
six-day " bicycle race of ** which he is the I
prime mover. Brady, t , notwithstanding j
his long overland, "trip, -looked as fresh j
and wide-awake as he. always does, and 1
as usual is "full of fight"â is, for the j
men 1 whom he has taken under his pro- i
tecting* wing. These are "Kid" McCoy !
and' Jeffries. . He did 'not know until he
reached this city that the "Kid". had de- \
cided to put himself under his guidance,
but a telegram from McCoy which read :
"Will meet Choynski after March 20. Ar
range everything. I will train in Los An- :
geles," clinched the bargain which was i
started in New York a few weeks ago.
Brady was jubilant over the prospective
match and â  expressed -his belief that It
would be a great fight. Brady met Eddie
Graney, Choynskl's manager last
evening and the match was speedily
made. The* men will meet at catch
weights before the * Palace Athletic Club ,
on March 24. 7.7 Â '"â ...
' From his other telegrams Brady gave ;
out the information that the Fitzslm
mons-Sharkey match was off because
O'Rourke and Julian could not agree on
the date ,of contest. Sharkey wanted a
postponement which had all the ear- j
marks of being Indefinite, and the. match j
fell through. -
â¢â¢'. The third telegram, contained the infor
mation that Fitzsimmons and Jeffries are j
.practically matched. There was a â  big
crowd at the conference of the represen
tatives of the big fellows in -New York
yesterday, and another meeting will be i
held ' to-day to sign articles. Julian's de
mand that Jeffries' $2500 be deposited in
the Journal office this morning at 9 o'clock .
will be complied, with to the letter.
When Brady was asked when the fight
would take place *he answered: "We ;
would like to fight :in -six weeks. Any
old - time will : suit â¢ us. Jeffries is now i
sparring in â¢ Portland, Maine, but I will
have him on the scene of the contest right
away. He gave exhibitions in Boston on
Monday night, but was stopped : by . t c
authorities, and he punched. the bag the
rest of the week. He -was : matched to
meet Joe Goddard -on -, February - 21, â¢ but

meeting.' . - â¢''â¢-"*
"In â¢; regard to Corbett Tx would like to

With Him.
"I believe this to be the fastest- indoor
track of its size ever constructed -in the
world," remarked diminutive - Jimmy
Michael, the middle-distance champion of
the world as he dismounted from , his
wheel after a two-mile, spin, around the
eight-lap board surface just completed in
the Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday, after
noon. â â â¢â -,. . â¢_*. / . :
Michael, in the presence of fully 500 on
lookers, had just finished â¢ two ' miles jat a'
1:55 clip, paced by Henri Fournier's won
derful gasoline racer. It was a marvel
ous, hair-raising performance, and; a hun
dred watches were held on the "Welsh
Rarebit" as he "tacked on" behind the
wizard Frenchman, after riding a couple
of laps to warm up, and set out to try,
his speed on the track to determine
whether he might reasonably, expect to be
successful in his trial against the world's
five-mile record at the opening of \ the
meet to-morrow night.
F. Ed Spooner, the well-known Eastern
newspaper man, Jack McGlynn of the
Olympic Club, and R. A. Smyth, official
handicapper of the Pacific Coast, took
the time from the tape, so its accuracy
is guaranteed.
Fournier had been using the track for
a * couple of hours before Michael came
out. Every imaginable sort of a bicycle
racer had during that time tacked on be
hind him. Fournier was running his ma
chine at about a 2:10 clip, and for some
time Miller. Waller, Pierce, Lawson, Tur
ville and the other six-day man followed
behind him, at what they termed "a com
fortable pace." If 2:10 for mile after mile
is a "comfortable" pace for them, what
must they do when riding hard, is the
question the onlookers asked themselves.
Miller had but a short time previously
ridden an unpaced mile in 2:04, which is
better than the Coast record. The men
with their big-geared machines, most of
which run up to 116 or 120, seemed to be
going slowly, however, compared to the
swiftly moving piston rod and the rapid
"choo, choo, choo," emitted from Four
nier's pacer.
After the long-distance riders had had
their exercise, the sprinters were given a
chance to ride behind Henri. McFarland
and Stevens, of "I and Stevle" fame, were
the first ones out rapidly followed by
Jay "King" Eaton, Teddy Goodman, Har
ry Gibson and Harry Elkes. Shortly aft
erward came "Big Bill" Furman i and
Fritz Lacey, who had arrived from Los
Angeles but a few hours before. They
have been training down there for this
meet, and are in good shape. Lacey is a
firofesslonal, and Furman says he Is go
ng to turn "pro." at once, as he "needs
the money." Russ, Bozio. Kragness and
numerous other amateur Olympians also
tried out during the day and showed
splendid speed. i,'
The performance of the afternoon, how
ever, was Michael's try-out for two miles.
Little Jimmy has been doing much quiet
training in the park on his wheel, and
many Is the would-be racer who has
tacked on to this diminutive sprinter out
there, thinking he was only a boy and eas
ily left behind, only, to soon see the form
of the supposed boy vanlsn rapidly in the
distance as he pedaled out of sight at a
two-minute clip.
After encircling the track a couple of
times -to get warmed un the "Rarebit"
caught the rear wheel of Fournier's ma
chine and they were soon flashing around
the track so fast that a man standing in
the center and turning his head to follow
them could not keep in one position more
than a second. .â â ;â¢'-
Fournier's pacing machine is so ar
ranged that he can set it at a given speed
and it will keep it up for miles at a time.
Thus It was an easy matter for him to
set the register at "1:55" per mile, and it

The long-distance riders at the track
all have two pairs of handle-bars on their
machines, one pair upturned and the oth
er dropped. Ii they want a comfortable,
"for health and pleasure" position, they
ride resting on the upper pair. If some
one is trying to pass them in a dashing
sprint they drop down to the lower ones
and give him a rub that he won't for
get. And what the six-day men don't
know about bicycle racing is hardly worth
while learning. They are familiar with
every possible feature of the game.
