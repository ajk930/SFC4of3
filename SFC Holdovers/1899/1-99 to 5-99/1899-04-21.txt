The conflagration is the worst that

Story of the Imprisonment of the Com
mander of the Falke Carries Its
Own Refutation.
THE story of the arrest at Apia
of the captain of the German
cruiser Falke by a party of Brit-
ish biuejackets, brought to Vic
toria by the Australian liner Ao-angi
to-day, carries its own refutation.
The Aorangi does not stop at
Samoa on her trip from "Wellington,
N f Z.. to British Columbia, but does
call at Suva, Fiji. The distance irom
Samoa to Fiji is only about 500
miles.
Giving the interisland steamer two
days to make the run of 500 miles
from Apia to Suva and the mail
boat 14 days to make the run from
Fiji to British Columbia, that would
make the news from Samoa bear date
of April 1, or, giving &n extra 24
hours for the doubt, say March 31.
Thus the Upolo, leaving Apia on
the afternoon of April 1, should reach \
Suva on the morning of the yd, and
the Aorangi (a 13-knot ship), pick- \
ing up the news on the afternoon of
April 6, on her arrival there, should
reach Victoria on the 20th.

HI RAPELJI
SLAYER OF
LEONG TUNG
A Sensational Development
in the Highbinders' War
at Fresno.
SjwiaJ r>is>peteh to The Call.
FRESNO, April 20.â Hi Rapelji, the
deputy sheriff who acquired fame
throughout the State a few years ago
1 by his rapture of Sontap and Evans,
! created a sensation to-night by con
fessing to District Attorney Everts
that he had shirt and killed Leone; Tung,
one of the victims of the highbinder
riot in Chinatown last night.
Rapelji is now employed as a watch
! man in the Chinese quarter and was
' the first white man to reach the scene
of the excitement after the shooting
commenced. During the melee he
caught a Chinaman named Wong Duck
and turned him over to Deputy Sheriff
Walden. At the time he claimed that
: he had seen Wong Duck sh<x>t and kill
j Leong Tung.
At the inquest held over the remains
of the dead Chinaman to-da^- Rapelji
denied that he had seen Duck kill Tung.
but claimed that he simply caught him
running in the alley during the shoot
ing. Rapelji's testimony was regarded
as rather peculiar and was a surprise
to every one.
To-night District Attorney Everts vis
ited Chinatown in company with At-
W. I). Crichton and together
tht-y proceeded to cross-examine the
watchman. The latter told a number
onflictlng Btortes, but was finally
red by the attorneys and admit
ted that he himself had fired the bul
let which killed Leong Tung.
When he entered the alley after the
commencement of the shooting Hapelji
saw a Chinaman lying prostrate on the
ground and being held down by another
Mongolian. A third man stood a few
iway and was discharging his pis
tol at the body on the ground. The
man who was holding the victim down
was Wong Duck, the victim was heong
rho is now In the Morgue, and the
Bhooter was Leong Tung. RapHjl
rushed up and struck Tung, who
turned to run into an adjacent door
ordered to halt and upon
his' refusal to do so Rapelji tired, kill
ing him instantly.
The watchman then turned around
and Baw Wong Duck In the act of run
. from the body of the dead
Chinaman. He caught thp Celestial by
the queue and held him until the ar
rival .'f the peputy Sheriff. After the
shooting Rapelji declared that the man
who had been lying on the groufid
jumped up and bolted. His dead body
on a slab at th" Morgue Is a mute con
tradiction of this story.
Commander F. C. D. Sturdee oF the British Cruiser,
Who Probably Does Not Hold the Commander
of the Falke Prisoner.
The story, as told to the Suva and
Honolulu papers by the late arrivals
from Apia, is that the captain of the
Falke Is charged with having supplied
the rebels under Mataafa with arms
and ammunition, having, the Upolu's

PRESIDENT
IN FEAR OF
TOM REED
Believes the Maine Man Is
Looking Toward the
White House.
Spprlal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 20.â Thomas B. ]
Reed's change of residence from Maine j
to this city has created uneasiness I
among the friends of President McKin
ley. They suspect that instead of ]
abandoning his Presidential ambition ;
Reed has merely shifted his ground to i
be in a better position to attack the j
convention next year.
Governor Roosevelt's admirers alFo j
are not overjoyed at having a Repub- j
Mean of Reed's importance invade the j
State. They fear he may stand in the
way i if their favorite when the time 1
t for New York to select candi- j
dates.
Senator Platt's friendship for the '
former Speaker is looked upon aS an!
element of danger in the situation.
While ostensibly supporting Governor
Morton for the nomination in 1596, it i
was no secret that he was really for
Reed. Though he has made his peace j
with President McKinley and is now
on an intimate footing in the White i
House, the President's friends have not
forgotten the bitter assaults which he,
made upon President McKinley before
the St. Louis convention.
They are disinclined to credit the :
financial reason given by Reed's friends
for his removal to this city. They say
he was receiving a comfortable in- I
come, and that he would not have
withdrawn from his position of power |
and infitience in Washington merely for
the sake .>f increasing it. They sus- !
pect that a secret understanding ex- j
ists between him and Senator Platt j
whereby the fight which was lost in ;
1596 will be renewed next year.
With the seventy-two delegates of
New Fork at his bai k Reed would be
a much more formidable candidate for
the. Presidency than, he was as the can
didate of the twelve delegates from
Maine. Moreover, his strength in New
England would probably be at his dis
posal even sh^uM he becotne the can
didate of New Fork.
Should there be a change of senti
ment in regard to the results of the
war with Spain it is even feared by
President McKinl?y's 'friends that
Reed's anti-expansion views and his !
freedom from responsibility for the new
policy would make him strong in the
convention.

KNIGHTS TEMPLAR IN
A BEAUTIFUL PARADE
MASONIC TEMPLE AT SACRAMENTO.
SACRAMENTO, April 20.â The en
campment of the Grand Com
mandery and department <â â  n
clave of the Knights Templar of
California opened in this city this
morni;:g with a short session devoted
to the presentation of reports, followed
by the annual parade and review. The
city never looked more attractive than
it did to-day, garbed in the Templar
colors >'f white and black, relieved by
the Stars and Stripes. On all sides the
decorations were in evidence, and in
many instances they represented th>
expenditure <>f much labor and money,
the business men of the city appearing
to disregard all other considerations in
the < ndeavor to make the visitors feel
that they were heartily welcome.
The main feature of the 'lay was the
parade this afternoon of the command
eries. For such an occasion the weather
was simply perfection, the sky being
free from a single cloud and a soft
breeze cqoling the air. Thousands of
women, dressed in summer attire, im
parted to the crowded sidewalks along
the linp of march the charm of fresh
ness and color, and it is doubtful if
the Knights ever marched through a
city which beamed such a cheery hos
pitality or invited more irresistibly to
enthusiasm.
The spirit of the day caught the musi
cians, the plumed Knights and the
populace -ill at once, and- there is no
body among the hundreds of visitors

seen Sacramento under such favorable
conditions.
The procession was headed by Thief

rendered without resistance. They were
placed in the launch, with the rifles
they had intended to land, and hur

tion Captain Sturdee hastily sum

The parade proceeded through the
principal streets, over more than two
miles of smooth bitumen pavement, and
was watched by thousands. Along
Capitol Park the review by the grand
commander took place and the sight
was an impressive one when the
Knights marched along in the shadow
of the palms that sentinel the outer
edge of Capitol Park. Even upon the j
balconies of the Capitol itself people
had stationed themselves to catch an
advantageous view of the procession.
The forty-first annual session of the
Grand Commandery of the Knights
Templar of Calrfornia opened this
morning in the Masonic Temple, which
had been rendered a thing of beauty
by the handiwork of the decorator and
florist: The commandery was called to
order by the grand command* r, Robert
Morns Powers Of San Diego, who pro
-1 to read his annual address. Re
ferring to the recent war with Spain,
following the blowing up of the Maine,
the gvi-nd commander said:
These events are mutters of recent his
tory and familiar to you all, and I men
tion them only to show that In this rec
ord-making epoch our fraters, whether or
land or sea. nobly performed their part,
adding greater luster and greater mean
ing to the term "American."

at Manila, Sir Knights Gobin and Moul
tnn in Cuba, and at the front on the fight
ing line at San Juan Hill and El Caney
could be found the modern Coeur de
Lion, (far honored frater, "Fighting Joe"
Wheeler.
But as Knights Templar and as citizens
of this greal republic we recognize one
grand, central figure, who hart previously
proven himself a patriotic soldier and
officers that, there being ample evi
dence of the guilt "f the Germans,
they must stand by the action of Cap
tain Sturdee.
Both ships got under way. and af
ter they had taken up positions on
either side of the German ship, orders
were sent on board the Falke to re
main at her moorings under peril of
immediate annihilation by the war
ships on either side. The senior of
ficer of the Falke was informed at
the same time by the joint command
ers of the British and American ships
that they were prepared to back up
their action.
The German officer sent letters pro
tecting against the action of Captain
Sturdee and Admiral Kautz, but made
no move.
With the issuance of the orders to
"lie still" to the Falke, communication
with the German ship was to all in
tents and purposes cut off, and no one
w;ts allowed to leave or go aboard ihe
Falke without permission written and
signed of either Admiral Kautz or Cap
tain Sturdoe.
The position is, the Upolu's passen
gers said In their reports to the Suva
papers, greatly strained. The Ameri
cans and British have come to a tacit
agreement that the flagrant acts of ih?
Germans in encouraging and aiding the
rebel chief Mataafa had gone far
enough, and when news was brought
to them that the Falke's commander
intended to put more arms ashore, the

WASHINGTON OFFICIALS
DISCREDIT THE STORY
WASHINGTON*. April 20.â The state
ment that the commander of the Ger
man cruiser Falke had been arrested
at Apia by the British naval com
mander was at once scouted by the of
ficials to whom it was referred here.
Both Secretary Alger and Secretary
Long expressed their disbelief in the
I accuracy of the report. Attention was
directed to the fact that the Navy De
partment heard from Admiral Kautz
! by cable from Auckland at a later date
I than that upon which the steamer just
\ arrived at Victoria must have sailed
\ from Suva. Admiral Kautz' dis-
I patches were dated April 4 and were
forwarded from the nearest cable sta
tion, Auckland, April 12.
It is pointed out in official German
quarters that the arrest of the com
! mander of one warship by the com
mander of another is an absurdity, and
moreover, cable advices have reached
the Embassy much later than those
which a steamer had brought to Vic
toria. No such action was disclosed.
The British Embassy also is without
any Information of auch an occurrence2
It is suggested as an explanation of
the story that the steamer's crew had
heard of the arrest .a" the German
manager of the plantation where the
American and British .sailors were
ambushed and were taken aboard the
British warship and had jumped to the
usion that the person arrested was
the German commander.

POWERS CANNOT CHECK
THE TRIBAL WARFARE
Fighting Between the Forces of Ma-
lietoa Tanu and Mataafa
Continues.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 20.â Samoan
advices t'> April 3. via Suva, n^r
Aorangi, are to the effect that fighting
between the men of the newly crowned
King Malietoa Tanu and Mats
men continues, and Bcarcely any busi
- lone. It Is said thaf the
Mataafa faction has been weakening
considerably of late, and a large num
ber of former adherents .â¢.;< ready to
take sides with Malietoa. Some of the
Mataafa chiefs, in order t" intimidate
those who were turning, mad.- threats
to them that their villages would be
burned and their chiefs kill< d. They
replied that they would d>> lik
with the Mate The Mataafa
party then resorted to intimidation
with thp Malietoa prisoners at Macana
and Aana. Finding that the :
with whom these pris< i bil
leted were among those to change their
political views, and that the pria
making too many friends, they
sent nit-n down to remove the chi<
Mali< toa people in th">" 61 i
The prisoners were brought from the
island to the mainland, and while on
way the Mataafa iii--!i an
themselves by firing volleys over the
heads of th-' Malietoa chiefs, who
forced to pull the l">ats. In spite of
all the threats, the Malietoa men re
main firm and still trust that th<
dsion of the Chief Justice will be UD
held and their King will get his throne.
The continued inaction of the pow
ers is having an influence on the na
tives. The followers of Malietoa are
living in fear of their lives and prop
erty. The prisoners on Tutuila have
petitioned to be taken back to Apia, be
cause when the recently crowned
Malietoa Tanu is secure on his throne
they fear the rebel force will send a
strong party down to the islands where
they are in captivity and kill them.
The Malietoa men are also being
hunted for taxes, at the Instigation of
the President and the provisional srov-
The provisional government

ate. The blue jackets' guard got wind
of it, but before they could capture the
ifa Embassy it had taken to iis
heels in the brush. Mai - â¢ Uow
l< spite the fact that a number of
the weaker ones are deserting their
cause, are daily getting mure and more
daring and arrogant, and more mau
. â¢ <i.
The provisional government, too, con- :
tinues to force itself on the natives. It
has sent ii"v. four chiefs to Tutuila I
to collect taxes, but the British and
American Consuls have written â¢advis
ing the people not to pay any taxes to
the government. When the Upolu left
Apia for Suva there was considerable
sickness among the British and Ameri
can seamen. A number were suffering
from dysentery and tropical fevers,
brought on by the excessive heat and
malaria-producing weather.
Three days prior to the sailing of the
Upolu one of the gunners of the British j
ship Porpoise succumbed to dysentery
despite the unremitting attention of the
ship's doctor. His remains were taken
ashore and buried in the foreign ceme
tery Just outside Apia with all military
honors. A landing party from the Phil
adelphia accompanied the British
funeral party, and the firing squad was
composed half of Americans and half
of Britishers. This goes to show the
friendly relations between these pow
ers. This is the second death on the
Porpoise since she arrived at Apia.
Both officers and men have suffered
greatly from fever as well as dysentery,
and a great number are down with
abscesses under the arm pits and on
the feet and legs.
The Porpoise has the greatest num
ber of sick. There are comparatively
few sick on the Philadelphia. Lieuten
ant Bhuter of the Porpoise was in the
hospital when the Updid left, and Lieu
tenant Gaunt was also down with fever.
He was the officer in charge of the
landing party which defended the con
sulates at the first attack.
The Porpoise's men are quite run
down with their long spell in the trop
ics. They were engaged in cruising the
South Seas for some considerable time
before they were ordered to Apia.
"When- the Upolu left Apia there was a
terrible panic among the followers of
the new King. It was reported to
Mataafa, and the German Consul has
the credit of propagating the news, that
the British were going to storm Mull
nuu and call together all the Malletoa
people, arm them, and place Malietoa
and Tamasese on the seat of govern
ment. Immediately there was an ex
odus of chiefs from Mulinuu, with Ma
taafa, who retired several miles up the
coast to Vaiusu, and all day goods
were being carried away from the
point.
The Malietoa people, scattered all
over the country among their conquer
ors, are greatly trembled on account of
threats, made by the Mataafa people
that as booh as the British should start
fighting against the Mataafans there
MURDERER MOORE'S
DOG IS DISCOVERED
Sheriff Getchell Will Try to Catch
the flr>imal in Order to Trace
the fugitive.
NEVADA CITY, April 20.â Murderer Moore's halfbreed shepherd dog,
who disappeared with its master three -weeks ago, after the latter had
killed Policerr.Jin Kilroy. was seen at Spanish Joe's, cabin, p.n eighth of
n mile from where Moore used to live, at 2 o'clock this morning. He
was in a half-famished condition and but a shadow of bis former self.
Joe heard him gnawing at some bones at his back door and going
out attempted to rateh him. but he fled like a hare. It is thought he
will come back to-night and a trap has been set to capture him alive.
If this can be done Sheriff Oetchell will put a leash on him in the morn
ing in the hope that he will lead a posse to Moore's hiding place, if
that worthy is still in this locality.
The ofTirers have three theories. One is that Moore is stiU secreted
In the jungle around Banner Mountain, and having exhausted his food
supply has been forsaken by the dog. The second is that he has b*en
lying |>w untlfwithin a day or two and then, driving away the dog,
which he is thought to have cherished too highly to kill, fled. The third
theory is that Moore has either died from starvation and exposure or
committed suicide, and that the dog, finding himself without a master,
. red back to h ; s old haunts.
would be a. wholesale slaughter of the
unarmed Malletoa men ami women.
When the Upolu left, her passengers
say, messengers arrived at Apia with
news that a command had been issued
by Mataafa that all people were to as
semble toward Apia to resist the land
ing- â¢;' the British and to make an at
tack on the British residents. This
command only the Atuans obeyed.
They have taken up a position in the
woods to the eastward of Apia, but did
not seem anxious to begin the prom
ised attack. Only a few of the Savaii
adherents have arrived and it is re
ported from that- place that they are
lukewarm. Nevertheless those of the
Mataafa people who are in the vicinity
of Apia talk big and make rash threats,
especially against- the women of the'
deported chiefs. They also threaten to
burn Mulinuu should Great Britain do
anything against them.
One foreigner who has been making
himself prominent .with Mataafa wrote
to the United States Consul, as one
having the confidence of Mataafa,
that if the British Consul did not exalt
Mataafa his people would become ex
asperated and in less than several days
there would be a massacre of British
and British sympathizers. The â¢ con
tents of the letter were submitted to
Consul Maxse.
Residents of Apia who are thoroughly
conversant with the situation say that
unless the warships are kept at Apia
the newly crowned Malietoa Tanuâ
barefooted boy, with a lava lava and a
white jacket, thus they describe him â
will be unable to establish himself. Un
less he were strongly supported by the
powers there would be a rebellion inside
of three months. As matters stand, ac
cording to the residents of Apia, it is
a mistake to establish a King In Samoa
at all. The only safe method is for the
native government to permit the hered
itary chief of each district to govern his
own people.
The situation was undoubtedly de
plorable at last accounts by the Upolu
and Aorangi. The homes of the un
happy loyalists have been razed; they
are now banished from their kindred
and their household goods have been
looted by the rebel warriors under Ma
taafa, and the great powers now rep
resented there seem impotent to stop
the. tribal warfare..

TALENTED NURSE
ENTERS THE PESTHOUSE
LOS ANGELES, April 2n.â A pesthouse
at any time is not an attraction, and the
aggregation of buildings that servo thia
purpose for Los Angeles forms no excep
j tion. Still the unfortunate little colony
i of isolated and Infected patients that is
removed from the world has found a new
ministering angel in the person of Miss
A. Tisrlale, a young and talented trained
nurse, who last night, leaving the world
and all Its possibilities of health and hap
piness behind her, went out to the gloomy
little group of buildings in the northwest
hills to nurse the smallpox patients.
There has been great difficulty In secur
ing trained nurses for the work. Dr. Fow
fis. the Health Officer, for a long time
sought only BUch attendants as have had
Tii" disease. As the city pays $3 a day
j to nurses. Dr. Powers felt that he could
not solicit nurses who had not them
selves experienced the trial. Miss Tis
i as not had the disease, but she has
â tly been well vaccinated and goe3
among the infected patients without fear.
Bhe abandons engagements for the lead
ing physicians of the city to accept this
d ity. Under present arrangements a
suspected person must be taken to the
Pothouse when he may not be infected
â¢ with smallpox, and as the pesthouse lacks
many of the modern tittings and appli
ances, the situSllon is one of getting
along the best the doctors can.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1899.
MANY BELIEVED
HIM INNOCENT
Witnesses Testified in
Dreyfus' Favor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, April 20.â The Figaro, con
tinuing to-day its publication of tes
timony offered before the Court of
Cassation in the Dreyfus revision in
quiry, devoted twenty-four columns to
some twenty depositions of minor of
ficials, most of which were favorable
to Dreyfus. It gives also a fac-simile
of the bordereau.
Major Forslnetti, who was director of
the Cherche-Midi Prison in 1800. at the
time of the condemnation of Dreyfus,
testified that Dreyfus consistently and
persistently protested his innocence
and after he was condemned repeated
ly asked for a revolver, declaring that
his only crime was in having been born
a Jew.
The witness said that aft^r the peti
tion for a revision of the trial by court
martial was rejected Colonel Paty
dv Clam visited Dreyfus and tried his
Utmost to draw from him a confession
that he had been entrapped into a
guilty communication of documents to
a foreign power. Dreyfus energetically
protested that he was not guilty, and
Colonel Paty dv Clam said, in part
ing from him: "If you are really In
nocent, y>'ii aif the greatest martyr of
the century."
Major Forslnetti told the court that
I he quest â  n d Captain Lebrun Renaud
regarding the alleged confessions of
Dreyfus, bui Captain Lebrun Renaud
promptly denied that Dreyfus had con- â¢â 
â 1 anything. Major Forslnetti
added that, although 1"- and Major
Atteles v. i re on terms <>f great friend
ship, the latter had never mentioned
any confession to him. ForsinettJ de-
I dared that he was convinced of the in
nocence of Dreyfus.
Many others testified f'>r and against
Dreyfus. There were numerous wit
i nesses who deposed that they had come
intu contact with Captain I>-hrun Re
naud, and that he never mentioned any
confession of Dreyfus. Among these
was the Abbe Valadier, to whom Cap
| tain Lebrun Renaud described a srore
of times the degradation scene without
ever alluding to any confessions.
M. Bertillion, the handwriting expert,
pravf the reasons which led him to con
sider that the bordereau was forged by
tracing the words and pointed out de
tails in the writing that were common
to the bordereau and to the handwrit
ing of Madame Dreyfus and also to that
<>f the brother of the prisoner. Several
words that he showed were about iden
tical.
M. Bertillion explained the points
which led him to regard Dreyfus the
author of the bordereau. When Bertillion
was testifying before the court-martial
Dreyfus exclaimed: "Oh! Le monstre,
tv done lecriere." After this exclama
tion Dreyfus ceased to follow the tes
timony.
Mme. Teysonniere and Charvay, the
experts, testified to the similarity of the
writing of the bordereau and that
Of Commandant Esterhuzy, while M.
Pelletier, another expert, energetically
insisted that the handwriting was not
that of Dreyfus.
M. Gobert of the Bank of France tes
tified to a similar effect and expressed
his conviction that the handwriting
was that of JEsterhazy.

WILL IT RUSH
FOR THE OLD AX
Berkeley . and Stanford
: , Are Agreed.
Special : Dispatch ' to The Call.
PALO ALTO, April 20.â The proposal
of the Berkeley faculty to call the in
tercollegiate field day and debate off
for the year on account of the likeli
hood of an intercollegiate rush over the
stolen Stanford ax and the confidence
of the Stanford faculty that no such
action was necessary if the students of
the California University refrained
from raising the ; ire of the cardinal sup
porters by a display' of the purloined
trophy, resulted in sending Professor
Greene 'to' Berkeley this afternoon to
confer with the faculty of the Univer
sity of California. Satisfactory ar
rangements were made- and assurances
given by the Berkeley faculty that the
visitors from Stanford would be treated
with proper respect.
After Professor Greene's return from
Berkeley this evening a conference be
tween the members of the faculty, the
committee on athletics and students*
affairs was held, and a report made to
President Jordan. The latter then, to
gether with Professor Richardson, is
sued the following statement, which
was posted on the bulletin board:
The committee on athletics has every
assurance that our students are to be re
ceived at Berkeley as guests and to be
treated with every courtesy at the field
day next Saturday. Our students are
urged not to allow themselves to be
drawn Into any rush or ungentlemanly
conduct. Anything resembling a personal
encounter between the students of the
two universities must disgrace them both
and will lead to the suspension of all in
tercollegiate contests. Let no old ax cut
off our sense of dignity and self-respect.
DAVID S. JORDAN,
(President.
GEORGE M. RICHARDSON,
Chairman Athletic Committee.
The question of the final disposition
of the ax is yet to be solved. The
sentiment of the student body is
against accepting it from Berkeley.
The faculty committee, acting on this
feeling,- has declined -a proposition -of
the Berkeley faculty for its speedy re
turn. ] ,
PAILLERON, POET AND
DRAMATIST, IS DEAD
PARIS. April 20.â Pailleron, the poet
and dramatist, is dead.
Eduord Ju!< s Henri Pailleron was born
in Paris In 1524, and began life as a law
yer's clerk. He made his entry into the
world of letters in IS6O with a volume of
satires in verses, entitled "The Parasite,"
and by a piece in one act, in verse. "The
Parasite," played at the Odeon -Theater,
was a success. A year later he made a
derided hit at the Theater Francaise with
hiÂ« two-act comedy in verse, "La Dernier
Quartier," a most ingenious and delicate
piece. This was followed at the Gymnose
by a brilliant little literary effort. "Le
Atonde Ou l'Ons' Amore." and later on
by the four-act comedy, "Faux Me
nages," in which the interest and emo
tions were of a far deept'r and more sen
suous character.
His "Helene," a drama in three acts, in
verso, was produced with success at the
Theatre Francaise In 1V72. His greatest
triumph, perhaps, was achieved with his
famous comedy in three acts, in prose, en
titled "Le Monde Ou l'Ons' Ennui,"
which was presented in ISBI and secured
his election as a member of the French
Academy in the place of Charles Blanc.
Other of his best known pieces are 'T.:i
N' " and "Le Narcotlque.
M. Fnillernn's works are distinguished
for their polished literary style, their wit
and humor, th.-ir keen satire and their
fertile imagination.
RUSSIA'S FINANCIAL
CONDITION IS CRITICAL
BERLIN, April 20.â The Cologne Ga
zette has received reports from Constan
tinople saying it is asserted in financial
circles that the regular payment of the
Russian War indemnity through the Otto
man Bank will be used as a guarantee for
an external Russian loan of about 300 000,
--000 francs. Russia's financial condition
is described as giving little cause for re
joicing, and, indeed, it is downright criti
cal. Russia hns been needing a large loan
for a long time, which can only be raised
abroad.
All efforts in this direction have been
unsuccessful, notably In Paris, where they
have repeatedly met with a point blank
refusal. The co-operation or the Ottoman
Bank is being courted in order to facili
tate success on the Paris Bourse. Should
the attempt to raise a loan in Paris again
fail the London market will be tried.

NEW ORLEANS, April 20, Arcll
bishop Chapelle was to-day officially
informed by his Eminence Cardinal
Rampolla, Secretary ol State to L#o
XIII, that the Holy Father hud ara
ciously granted the Archbishop'l "
quest concerning the episcopal see of
Porto Rico, by appointing th>- Rev.
James XL Blenk, S. M., of Now Orleans,
to fill it.
Father Blenk was chosen by the
Archbishop as auditor of the delegation
to Cuba and Porto Rico and he was
recommended by tho Archbishop for
the latter island because he deemed
him the most suitable clergyman ho
knew of to occupy that ancient see in
the present circumstances.
During his stay last winter in the
island of Porto Rico Father Blenk
pave such proofs of wisdom. Catholic
self-restr.niiit and patriotism that the
Archbishop thought he was rendering
a most signal service to the church and
to the United States by recommending
him as the next Bishop of Porto Rico,
under the new order of things. Fath
er Blenk was for years president of
Jefferson College, Louisiana, and since.
1896 lias been pastor of St. Mary's
Church, fifth district of New Orleans.
He is a member of a teaching and mis

GREAT UNREST AT THE
WHITTIER SCHOOL
LOS ANGELES, April 20.â The state- '
m*nt wns made to-day by those who arc
cognizant of the facts that affairs at the
Whlttler Reform School are In a state j
of chaos. Prospective changes in the t
management of the institution have ere- |
ated unrest among the pupils and officers, j
which nniy be removed by immedi- j
ately filling the existing vacancies among
the trustees. While General C. C. Allen :
has been discussed as a candidate for
trustee to succeed Mrs. Adina Mitchell. \
president of the hoard, it Is learned to-day
that Allen may become treasurer of the
school. Former Senator R. F. del Valle j
is now treasurer, and his friends hoped j
owing to a long acquaintance with Gover
nor Gage that he wmild be retained. It ,
is understood here that there is to ho a j
complete sweep in the management of the I
school. For this reason, it is stated. John
Kenneally will not he a member of the
new board.
The resignation of John Rowland has
pone direct to Governor Gage at Sacra
mento. Rowland's nephew. William Car- j
lisle, is slated to be deputy superintend- ;
â¢ in <>f the Bchool, no matter who may be
chosen to succeed Superintendent Van
AlÃtyn.
The statement that Walter F. Parker
is slated as the successor of Thomas
Lewis as expert to the State Board of
Examiners is denied by his closest
friends. Parker is in the desert country
examining mines, and will, it is said, re- I
port to the powers in Sacramento before '
he returns. It can he stated that Gover- i
nor Gage has been appealed to t' 1 deny >ir
confirm the report that John W. Mitchell
may succeed Robert N. Bulla on the Code
Commmlssion. Gage brands the story as
devoid of accuracy and without founda- |
tion. Republicans here assert that they
are willing to submit to some things that i
are within the province of a Governor. >
hut that the appointment of Mitchell j
would cause the members of the bar to
rill a meeting of their association and j
enter vigorous protests.
The statement is made here by the sad
die politicians that W. F. Fitzgerald is
not a possibility for adjutant general for
tho reason that when he was attorney
general he Insisted that M. M. Kstee had !
not been elected Governor. Dan Burns
was never knnwn to forgive a political
misstep, and this insistence In Fitzgerald
was unpardonable, and if the colonel can
prevent the appointment, as he probably
can, Fitzgerald will not, for three years
p.t least, grace the place that was so am
ply filled by General A. W. Barrett.
HENRY E. HUNTINGTON'S
OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTH
LOS ANGELES, April 20.â The dismis
sal of Henry E. Kuntington from his
place as assistant to the president of the
Southern Pacific has been followed by his
declaring to make Los Angeles his future
place of residence. Information leaked
out to-day that he is the largest owner
and controller of the Los Angeles Rail
way Company lines, as well as the Pasa
dena road. Jc was given out when the
purchase wr.s made* a few months ago
that the biggest share had been chipped
in by Collis P. Huntington. "While this
deal to sell the Santa Monica electric line
has not been .completed, the negotiations
are under way. When Collis P. Hunting
ton made his visit to Los Angeles April l
and became the guest of General If. H.
Sherman for a few hours it became
known then that the Sherman-Clarke syn
dicate made a proposition and offer of
sale to the Southern Pacific's president.
This has been met by a counter proposi
tion at the hands of the railroad magnate
and whenever the Santa Monica system
is secured it will be with the money of
1 nele Collie and not. it is stated in com
mercial circles, by the cash of the nephew,
as he is as deep in the scheme as it is
possible to venture.
It is freely predicted In quarters close
to the powers that the traction lines are
bound sooner or later to become a part of
the Huntington system. Negotiations to
bring about this result, undertaken
months ago. have never been given up it
being only a question of time when the
tntertata involved will reach common

DR. BUCKLEY IS
STYLED A FAKER
Dunn and Hill Testify
to That Effect.
ONE DOSE FOR ALL DISEASES
BROMIDE OF SODIUM HIS FA
VORITE PRESCRIPTION.
i Some Sensational Testimony Given
Before Superior Judge Angelotti
in the Celebrated Manning
Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. SAN RAFAEL, April 20.â Dr. E. P.
Dunn, insanity expert and city health
officer of Oakland, created a sensation
In the Superior Court during the hear
ing of the suit of Manning vs. Man
ning by branding Dr. C. F. Buckley,
the well-known San Francisco phy
sician, as a "faker." The flutter caused
by Dr. Dunn's caustic testimony waa
Increased by the testimony of Coroner
K. i; mil of San Francisco, who de
clared that Dr. Buckley found the
father of the Mannings a "good thing."
Ho. also swore that Dr. Buckley has one
prescription for almost every disease
under the sun â bromide of sodium.
Andrew Manning died at Tomales a
f<-w months ago and a few hours before
his death deeded his property, valued
at 126,000, to his daughter Margaret, a
handsome brunette, employed as fore
woman in a metropolitan cloak house.
J. J. Manning brought suit to have the
,lÂ« , ,i ,\, clared a deed of trust for all the
eight children on the ground that the
father was insane and unduly in
fluenced. The hearing of the case has
been in progress before Judge Angel
lotti for three days.
Dr. Buckley attended Manning for a
year prior to his death and all the
prescriptions were compounded at Cor
oner Hill's pharmacy. Yesterday Dr.
Buckley swore that Andrew Manning
had been troubled with progressive in
sanity and was a mental wreck when
he died.
Dr. Dunn was placed on the stand by
Attorney Hepburn Wilkins for the de
fense to-day, and expressed surprise
that Dr. Buckley had given such testi
mony. J. W. Keyes of counsel for
plaintiff asked Dunn what reputation
Buckley bore.
"Faker," was the laconic reply.
"Do you mean that?" asked Keyes.
"Yes, sir. He is considered a faker
and absolutely passe by the medical
fraternity."
"Passe is too aristocratic for my vo
cabulary," said Keyes. "What does it
mean?"
"Well," retorted Dunn, "the general
idea is that he is a back number."
When pressed for the names of phy
sician's who thought Dr. Buckley a
faker, Dunn said it would be unprofes
sional to tell.
Such a sensation was created by the
testimony that Sheriff Taylor had to
rap repeatedly for order.
Coroner Hill testified that Manning
was a "good thine," and had probably
been fnund so by Dr. Buckley.
"Dr. Buckley has one prescription for
almost every case," he added, 'bro
mide of sodium; he seldom varies."
Dr. Buckley was not present at to
day's proceedings and his friends as
sert that he will take proper action as
regards the so-called unprofessional
behavior of Coroner. Hill and Dr. Dunn.

batteries of artillery.
To replace the troops in the Philip
pines about 14.000 regulars will be dis
patched to Manila as soon as the nec
essary transportation can be provided.
Probably the first regiment to go will
be the Seventh Artillery, now distrib

rack?. Light Batter C and Mof this
regiment have been ordered home from
Porto Rico for service in the Philip
pines. Two other regiments, including
possibly the Eleventh Infantry, recalled
home from Porto Rico, will also be sent
to the Philippines. These reinforce
ments are in addition to the six regi
ments of regulars already under orders
to report to General Otis at Manila for
duty in the Philippines.
The plans of the 1 department contem
plate placing about 30,000 troops at the
disposal of General Otis in the early
fail, and to make the changes so grad
ually that his military strength will not
fall below its present figure of about
21,000 effective men. A vigorous, ag
igressive campaign has been determined
upon in the fall and will be prosecuted
to the bitter end. The insurrecti<_m is
to be effectually suppressed by force of
arms, if that result cannot be accom
plished by other riieans. It is said that
the army* in the Philippines is to be in
creased to 30.000 whether the insurgents
abandon the field or not, as it is recog
nized that even in the expected event
of the surrender of Aguinaldo a strong
military fierce will be needed in the
archipelago for some time to come.
To demonstrate the physical impossi
bility of bringing home the volunteer
forces in the Philippines under two
months' time the officials of the War
Department have prepared the follcrw
;ng statement of the present disposition
of army transports on the Pacific sta-

The fastest of seven transports now
at San Francisco can hardly reach Ma

therefore, be utilized for the return of
the volunteers before the Ist of June.
The Grant and Sherman are expected
to arrive at San Francisco early in
May and to start back for Manila be
tween the 15th and the end of the
month. They will not be available for
transportation home of volunteers in
the Philippines before July l.
The transports in the Philippines are
not considered available for the trans
portation home of volunteers, as they
are constantly needed in the archi
pelago. Three of them are held at Ne
gros, Cebu and Iloilo as possible asy
lums for foreigners in case of necessity.
Those at Manila re being held in re
serve for similar purposes, as well as
for use in possible expeditions to other
portions of the archipelago. It will
therefore be seen that the department
Is seriously handicapped In its trans

ON EXPANSION
Talks to Crowded House
at Syracuse.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SYRACUSE, N. V., April 20.â The Al
hambra, with a seating capacity of 3000
people, was comfortably filled with
an enthusiastic crowd to-night to hear
Colonel W. J. Bryan. Mr. Bryan, on be
ing introduced, was cheered to the
echo. His address covered old ground
on the subject of income tax and the
currency.
Taking up the subject of expansion,
Mr. Bryan said:
A large standing army is a burden to
taxpayers and a menace to the republic.
This nation can depend upon its volun
teers. They can defend it in the hour of
danger. (Vociferous cheering.)
What has happened to make more sol
diers necessary? Nothing but a Republi
can administration. The President says
our occupation of Cuba is temporary:
there is no trouble In Porto Rico. Seventy
thousand soldiers are wanted to carry the
benign blessings of freedom to 9.000,000
Filipinos. Who will pay the cost? .If
the Filipinos, they must be taxed four
times as high as Spain taxed them. If
we pay It. ask a gold man to show you
how it will get back to the taxpayers.
Common people furnish soldiers and syn
dicates get the money paid for war. I
, don't want a single soul to be brought
under the American flag unless he can
share in every blessing of this Govern
ment. (Great applause.)
Shall we call our chief executive Presi
dent of the United States and Emperor
of the Philippines? Government by one
man backed' by force is despotism. People
who are opposed to taking the Philippines
plead not for the Filipino but for the
American people, lest they may, by be
coming accustomed to despotism, be pre
pared to yield to despots. I oppose Chris
tianity fired out of a Gatling gun. The
man who is hit does not need the Gospel.
Does the laboring man want Oriental
labor to compete with him? Every nation
in Europe wants us guilty of conquest.
If we are to become an empire let us
send Bartholdl's statue back to France
and go to England and borrow a statue
of William the Conqueror. Let us treat
the Filipinos as we would the Cubans, and
we will erect in the harbor of Manila a
new statue of Liberty in the Old World.
ALLEGED THEFT OF
A JUNEAU STREET
TACOMA, April 20.â The Pacific Coast
Steamship Company is accused of steal
ing- an important part of Front street, in
Juneau. It is that part which runs down
to tidewater, where Juneau people have
expected eventually to maintain a city
wharf and other marine conveniences.
The Juneau Mining: Record gives this
account of the matter:
Wh-n J hn Oldl was Trustee of the city of
Juneau he laid out a continuation of Front
street which was to run to the water front
to connect with Captain Carroll's wharf site.
A man named Price, during times when Ju
neauites were doing more business than they
could handle, built a two-story house which
now lies vui ant It fact's Front street bn'-k t"
the Pacific toast Steamship Company's ware
house and stands squarely in the middle of the
street.
Years ago a suit was brought Involving this
building, and Price was ordered to remove it.
The order of the court was never carried into
execution, and the blocking proposition was
subsequently purchased by the Pacific Toast
I'nmimny, which now has wharf facilities in
that ixjrtion of the city blocked, and has ap
plied for a patent.
Citizens adjacent to the property are up in
arras against the proposition, and the Alaska 1
Chamber of Commerce has be^n appealed to.
A protest against the Issuance of a patent has
been sent to Washington. The Record claims
that had this street been legally opened before
this there would have been docks and coal
bunkers on the point, but to start to build
wharves now means a fight In the courts and
the Land Department for at least two yean. >

M ANY APPLICANTS
FOR THE POSITION
Commissioner of Public
Works.
Predial Pispatrh to The Call.
WOODLAND, April 20.â The merry
war among the applicants for the posi
tion of Commissioner of Public Works
on, notwithstanding the uncer
! talnty of the status of the legislation
affecting that office.
John Reith. a Yolo County applicant
for the position, was in Woodland
W'-dnesday morning, summoning the
old guard to his assistance, and as a
result of his visit a delegation consist
i ing of Judge Ruggles. Frank Mixon.
Frank Dietz, W. L. Wood. Supervisor
Russell and others went over to Sac
! ramento Wednesday afternoon and
urged Mr. Keith's claim before the
< governor.
The delegation returned Wednesday
evening and has since maintained a
discreet Biience in regard to the result
of the visit There is a rumor that
Governor Gage accorded a respectful
bearing to Mr. Keith's friends, but
gave no intimation of whom he fav
ored or when the appointment is likely
to be made.
It has been frequently reported, and
neither Assemblyman Pierce nor his
friends have denied it, that he is also
a candidate for the office. It hus also
been rumored that his candidacy is due.
t" assurance from persona who are
credited with being very Influential
with the chief executive, thai Governor
Gage is anxious to do something Coi
him as a reward for his friendship an 2
party services.
other prominent candidates are J. W.
Browning of Grand Island, Colusa
County, and ex-Senator William John
ston of Sacramento County. The !at
ter is credited with bringing to bear
h powerful political pull and with being
sanguine of success.
In the meantime the Attorney Gen
eral is wrestling with grave Legal prob
lems affecting the office. The last
Legislature attempted to repeal the
law under which the incumbent was
appointed, but neglected to express tlv
purpose of the bill in its title. There
are decisions <>f the Supreme Court
which indicate that the act is on that
account unconstitutional. There is still
a more serious defect. The act orig
inated in the Senate. It was twice
amended in the Assembly. The Sen
ate refused to concur. A conference
committee considered the matter and
the Assembly receded from the amend
ments. The enrolling clerk of the Sen
ate incorporated the amendments in
the act, notwithstanding the refusal of
the Senate to concur in them. The
records therefore show that the act as
signed by the Governor never nassed
the Senate. The validity of the act
may. therefore, be questioned upon two
vital points, and the opinion of the
Attorney General will be awaited with
much Interest.

DOCTORS TALK ON
MANY SUBJECTS
Close of the State Mcdi-
cal Society Meeting.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
DEL MONTE, April 20.â The sessions
on the last day of the State Medical
Society meeting were quite as well at
tended as on the previous days. Several
doctors who had intended leaving Del
.Monte in the morning remained for
another day because of the great value
of smne of the papers and discussions
introduced. At the morning session the
papers presented were as follows:
"A Study of Caesarian Section, Four
Cases," by Dr. W. S. Thorne of San
Francisco; "Intravenous Injections of
Mercury in Syphilis," by Dr. F. Dudley
Tait of San Francisco; "Twer Successful
Cases of Amputation Through the Hip
JÂ«,-int by Weyth's Method," by Dr. C. G.
Levison; "Preliminary Ãeport on Trans
plantation of the Ovaries," by Dr. J. F.
McCone of San Francisco, and "Intes
tinal Anastomosis," by Dr. J. Henry
Barbat.
Pru-fessor Le Conte discussed at some
length the paper of Dr. McCone, calling
attention to the great biologic value of
these experiments in transplanting
ovarian tissue from one animal to an-
Other. He also spoke very feelingly <>n
the question of vivisection. He thought
that one should always have great.
sympathy with all lite, but the degree
of consideration given should depend
upon the grade of life. It is better. In
Ins opinion, that a thousand dogs be
sacrificed rather than one human being
suffer unnecessarily. It sho-uld be
urged on the attention of all anti-vivi
sectionists that every effort is made to
the animals as much suffering as
possible through the use of anesthetics.
Great interest was taken in the work
of Dr. McCone and the words of Pro
fessor L.c Conte. Dr. Barbat's paper
save the results of his experiments on
dogs which had been made at the medi
cal department of the State University.
Now that so many people are having
appendicitis and are compelled to have
their intestines operated on the study
of methods for operating <>n the intes
tines is becoming very prominent.
Dr. F. Dudiey Tait of San Francisco
discussed Dr. Uarbat's paper at length
and complimented him <>n the great la
bor he had undertaken. During the
afternoon session Dr. Thomas W. Hunt
ington of San Francisco, recently the
Southern Pacific surgeon in Sacra
mento, reported the successful ampu
tation of bo-th legs in three cases, after
injury.
Dr. W. Lemoyne Wills of Los Angeles
reported a case of fracture and disloca
tion of the bones of the neck which
had occurred to an acrobat.
Dr. Huntingdon reported a case of
dislocation of the spinal column, which
occurred in July last In the person of
the nephew of Lieutenant Governor
Neft*. The dislocation of the bones was
successfully replaced by means of a
very ingenious device originated by Dr.
Huntington.
Other papers of the session were "Un
usual Features of Tubercular Pere
tonitis," by Dr. E. E. Kelly of San Fran
cisco, ;inÂ«l "A New Method of Applying
Plaster Jackets," by S. J. Hunkin of
San Francisco.
The society indulged in the customary
annual banquet in the evening, which
was thoroughly enjoyed hy the forty or
i .fi f u- members who remained.

It Is, no doubt, due to this fact and to
the systematic work the players under
go that such a high degree of profi

SPECIAL CONGRESS
DULY CONVENED
Work Yet Before Uni-
versal Brotherhood.
BY MRS. H. H. SOMERS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX DIEGO. April 20.â The special
congress c-f Universal Brotherhood con
vened this morning on Point Loma at
the site of the school for the revival of
the lost mysteries of antiquity. It will
continue the remainder of the week
until Saturday. The programme as
arranged will be two sessions daily, one
in the morning to consider business
affairs of the organization and one in
the afternoon, open to the public, for
the discussion of the questions and pur
poses in which the organization is in
terested and which it purposes lo pro
mote. Committees have been busy all
day arranging matters in their respect
ive jurisdiction which must receive im
mediate consideration and be acted
upon.
Some affairs of importance and of
interest to the general public will be
taken up. For instance it has been de
cided to improve the grounds of the
S. R. L. ML A. without delay. This work
will be begun just as soon as specifica
tions, now in preparation by capable
parties, can be completed.
Mrs. Tingley, with her cabinet, and
also with many of the international
representatives, will remain at Point
Loma for several days after the great
body of members of the congress have
departed, in order to enjoy a needed
rest after the labor of the congress and
to see that the work of improvement
is thoroughly inaugurated and well un
der way.
"Eumenides," the old Greek drama,
will be presented each night. It appears
that the general community is just be
ginning to realize the advantage of the
opportunity thus afforded them. Many
who have seen the presentation once
are returning for the second and third
timo, bringing others with them. No
higher commendation is possible. Prep
arations are in progress to make the
closing rendition on Saturday night es
pecially attractive and impressive, and
in order that no one may be deterred
by reason of the price from witnessing
the play tickets for that occasion are
reduced to 50 cents. The proceeds, of
course, will be used to further the
brotherhood movements.

CASE OF QUAY
BEFORE THE JURY
Failing to Agree It Is
Locked Up for Night.
VERDICT IS NOW UNCERTAIN
OPINIONS AS TO A DISAGREE
MENT OR ACQUITTAL.
The Ex-Senator Did Not Offer Any
Testimony in Defense, and His
Counsel Secured the Last
Argument.
Siwial Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA. April 20.â The case
of ex-United States Senator Quay was
placed in the hands of the jury
promptly at 3 o'clock this afternoon,
and no verdict being reached by 10
o'clock at night the jury was locked up
until morning.
There was no intimation, other than
mere rumor, as to the attitude of the
jury. The generally pxpr>-?spd opinion
of those who have followed the trial
since its beginning on Monday of last
week is that the verdict will he an ac
quittal. Many, however, look for a dis
agreement. There are but few who ex
press the belief that a verdict of guilty
will be given.
To-day's proceedings were confined
entirely to argument and the speeches
by counsel, the defenseÂ»deciding to pre
sent no testimony. Mr. Watson began
the day by requesting that the case be
withdrawn from the jury and a verdict
of not guilty rendered. He contended
that the commonwealth had utterly
failed to make out a case against Mr.
Quay. Judge Biddle determined that
the issues were those for a jury to de
cide and he ruled that it he gone
through in the usual way. Mr. Shields
here announced the defense's inten
tion to take no testimony, and under
the rules of the court he thus obtained
the privilege of making but one, the
last, speech to the jury.
District Attorney Rothermel spoke for
one hour. Mr. Shields followed for one
hour and three-quarters, and Judge
Biddle charged the jury in nine
minutes.
MRS. FRYE SCORES
PROFESSOR JORDAN
Says He Should at Once
Apologize.
Special Dispatch tn The Call.
BOSTON, April 20.â Mrs. William P.
Frye, wife of the former Peace Com
missioner, writes a most amazing open
letter to Professor David Starr Jordan
in reply to his recent lecture to the stu
dents of the Stockton, Cal.. High School
on "The Higher Criticism." Profess ir
Jordan attacked the administration and
its policy and told a story of one of the
Peace Commissioners going to a ban
quet in Paris and expectorating to
bacco juice on the floor. In Mrs. Frye*a
letter she says:
Evidently you lack not self -conceit, but
most certainly do discretion in speech.
You propose to address young men on
"The Higher Education." and then de
vote a portion of your time to a sense
less vulgar story which had not even the
merit of freshness nor the appearance of
truth. There was probably not one of
your audience so stupid as to accept for
fact your idiotic fiction.
Further along she says:
But what interests me most in your ex
traordinary harangue is your attack on
our Peace Commissioners, in which you
display such profound ignorance as to our
public" men. What do you mean by your
suggestion that "It would be better to
send men abroad wh>. are familiar wit.i
the usages of good society?" Are you ig
norant of the facts that one has been
Secretary of State, is now Circuit .1
that one has been a Senator, for two
terms the chairman of the Commit-
Foreign Relations, one of the most ac
complished lawyers in the Northwest and
a finished scholar; that one has been in
the House and Senate twenty-nine years;
that one has been Senator two terms and
is now a Circuit Judge, a gentleman by
birth and breeding; that one was pro
prietor and editor of the New \<>rk Trib
une, who has served us admiral"
Minister to France; that all were
iiates of our colleges; that all had â 
greater experience in polii â  and
greater familiarity with social ethics than
you could dream of?
Not one of these gentlemen chewed to
bacco: not one of them attended a ban
quet while abroad. Now do you not think
that you had better apologize to your
students for your cross and untruthful.
statements, and redeem, at least to that
extent, your reputation as a gentleman
and a scholar?

A member of the campaign committee
as asked yesterday as to the men the
Governor would consult In order to ascer
tain the views of the Republican State
organization In regard to the distribution
of patronage. The answer was: "The
Governor said he would consult member*
of the campaign committee before mak
ing appointments, in reference to the
appointment of Paris Kilbufh as Harbor
Commissioner members of this committee
were consulted."
In the southern part of the State there
Is considerable talk among Republicans on
the subject of reorganizing the Republi

timent Is expressed thai Parker and Os
borne do not represent the Republican
voters of that region of the State, and
that the party will suffer at the next elec
tion if they are to be recognized in the
future as party leaders.
A commltteeman at the Palace Hotel
yesterday remarkÂ« d: "There is nothing
in this talk of reorganizing the Republi
can State Central Committee, for there Is
nothing to reorganize for. The committee
will have nothing to do until the members
are called top'ther for the purpose of is
suing a call lor a eonvT'iition to select del
egates to the next national convention of
the party. ] do not know of any member
that desires further service on the com
mittee, and if reorganization should be
desired nearly all the members would be
willing to resign. There is much bad
feeling in the committee growing out of
the Senatorial contest, and when the
nit ml of the committee are called to
gether there will !Â«<â¢ an expression of this
feeling. 1 do not hear that a meeting is
contemplated, and see no reason for now

opinion that the Governor in maklnpr ap
polntmenta will consult leading members
of the committee and not recognize any
one man as having authority to speak for
the Republican organization. The Gover
nor has been advised that he ought to
appoint able and first-class men to nil
the offices under his administration; in or

The office of Commissioner of the Bu

R. A. GRAHAM'S COUNTER
CLAIM NOT AN OFFSET
JUDGE BAHRS RENDERS A DE-
CISIVE OPINION.
The Court Also Holds That the
Spreckels Note Case Is a Purely-
Equitable Action.
I Judge George H. Kahrs yesterday hand
ed down an opinion In the case of J. D.
Spreckels &- Bros. Company against R.
j A. Graham, In which tit court holds that
| the defendant's counter claim to the plain
tiff's action to foreclose upon a pledge
given as a security for the payment of a
note, amounting to $523,162 Z2. is manifest
j ly no cause of action upon which he can
j recover, or by virtue of which he can se
j cure any set-off against the plaintiff's
claim ami the same should therefore be
' dismissed. The court also holds that the
i case is purely equitable and consequently
| denies defendant's motion for a rial of
the action by jury.
In the opinion the court says that the
gravamen of defendants counterclaim to
plain! action is that plaintiff wrong-
I fully permitted fires to break out In cer
tain coal mines and permitted the fires to
I devastate the mine: that they wrongfully
; removed the machinery therefrom, and
j that the. same could not be operated; they
allowed the roof of the mine to cave in
and thereby cut off access to the same.
and finally shut down the mine aJso
gÂ«ther. Defendant also alleges that he
was induced to make large alterations in
and to a certain railroad, entailing a
! large expenditure of money upon him.
[ and that he was induced to make these
i changes and Incur these expenses
: through the representation of plaintiff
â  that it would cause the mine to be con
! Unually worked and that the product
thereof would be transported over the
railroad, thus furnishing a profitable busi
ness for the railroad for many years to
come. In thus shutting up the mine these
avenues of profit were closed to the de
i fendant. it is alleged, and it is upon these
; allegations that the defendant sets up
i his counter claim for $750,000 damages.
"No stockholder can sue on behalf of
! a corporationâ Graham's suit being on be
) half Bf the corporation owning the coal
â  mines in questionâ without first alleging
that the directors of. that corporation
have been requested to file suit and have
declined to do so." continues the opinion,
"and no stockholder can file rait at law
for injury done to his corporation. The
suit must be filed by the corporation. The
failure to make the corporation parties
to the action is therefore an incurable
defect. The action on hearing is one
against the defendant on his personal
liability, and he cannot by way of counter
claim offset claims that did not arise out
of the transactions which formed the
foundation of the plaintiff company's
: claim." "
I Continuing, the court says the alle&a-

PIGGOTT'S "PAL" CONVICTED.
Calvin Childs Found Guilty by a
Jury Last Night.
Calvin Chllds, the accomplice of Pick
pocket Jack Piggott, whose "pull" with
the courts proved to be mythical, was
found guilty by : . jury In Judge Dunn's
court after it had been out about fif
teen minute last evonlng.
The crime for which Childa stands con
victed was the taking of a pocketbook
containing Jl.'.J from xlenri Oule. a pas
senger on an Ingleside car, about two
months ago.
The- projectors of the Battle of Ma
nila panorama must derive considerable
satisfaction on overhearing: the favor
able comments passed by Interested
spectators as they view the reproduc
tion of the victory of Dewey'a fleet
over the Spanish squadron. The praise
is well deserved, for no finer panorama
has been seen in San Francisco. The
scenes are true representations of the
beautiful I M ui)n as it appeared
'>n the morning of the conflict. No
rtights of iinaÃination have boon per*
mltted, nor has the beauty and gran
deur of the work been allowed to suf
fer on account of labor or expense. To
form a correct Impression of how the
destruction of the Spanish fleet was
effected a visit to the panorama on
Market street, near Eighth, will suffice.

what difficult for the Santa Fe people be
cau Â£ c u ot l^ c attitude toward tho Yallev
fÂ£ a Â« that has 'always been maintained by
the Southern Pacific. Mr. Huntington has
never fancied competition, even of a the
jnretlcal . n tU , re / and it came to him
in a practlca form and as an accomplish
; ed fact In the completion of the Galley
TtÂ°lf he l^fi his T forces to work to stifle
It if he could. He never acknowledged
the existence of the Valley line save in
aggressiveness. He withheld the usual
Â«\ u ,rte.Â«ies even in the smallest, and
neither he nor his nephew would ever lend '
\ C V, to Â« Proposition for the interchanging^
j of traffic either freight or passenger.
Their demeanor changed radically, how- I
ever, when it leaked out that the Califor
nia line was to become a part of and af- '
ford a San Francisco terminal to tlfe !
, Santa Fe and that the existing competi- :
: tion was to become transcontinental rath
!er than local. Negotiations on the differ
ent phases of the question have since
been opened by both sides, and it is con
j fidently expected that it will all have
been settled by the time President Ripley 'â 
j has returned from his tour of Europe '
I ntil it is settled and the president has
returned nothing more will be done to
ward the final amalgamation of the two

SHIPWRIGHTS'
STRIKE HAS
BEEN SETTLED
Boole & Son Forced
to Give In.
FOREMAN BARNES IS OUSTED
UNION MEN WILL FINISH THE
WORK ON TRANSPORTS.
The Trouble Looked at One Time as
Though It Would End in a
General Strike on the
Front.
The trouble between Boole & Son and
Ipwrights 1 Association has been set
tled by Boole & Son yielding: to the de
mands of the workmen. During yesterday
afternoon the matter threatened to grow
Into a general strike, as the painters and
ealkors joined forces with the ship
wrights and walked out. The Labor "Union
\\a~ going to take up the fight, and the
result would have been a general boycott
on Boole & Son.
Foreman Barnes was the cause of all
the Btrife. Boole employed union men on
all his work, but Barnes bad been b'.ack
listed by the Shipwrights' Association f^r
some breach of union rules, and the men
refused t'.> either work for him or with
him. This was the state of affairs las:
Monday, and ever since Boole has been
trying to get men to till the places of the
Nk. rs. First he rallied for union men
I offered them extra inducements in
er to go to work. Then he advertised
for non-union men. and when they pat in
an appearance the calkers and painters
quit work.
Â»Ole & Son do nearly all the work on
Jovernment transports, and there are
"rush" jobs on hand just now which
made things very awkward for Boole,
The Leelanaw is being fitted out to carry
to Manila and she was to be r â  Ldy
II next Monday. The United States
auxiliary cruiser Badger is being got
to carry the Samoan Commission-
Apia, and she also was to be ready
I] on Monday. The strike Btopped
work on these vessels, and Captain How
aril, assistant general superintendent <>f
transports, Dad to Btep In. !!â¢â  insist
the work being completed, and that
at on.-,, so Boole had to take the only
course out of the dilemma. Barnes disap
from the ships as foreman and
union men will not be asked to work with
him, but he will remain in the employ of
i* Son under full pay in
capacity.
When the calkers and painters walked
â  â  Join the shipwrights yesterday afl
>n things were lively around 'Main

step has been - "~*
taken. They oftentimes come to a sad realiza-
tion of it when it is too late to avert the
danger that threatens.
Nervous decline, nervous prostration and all
other diseases of the nervous system come on
insidiously. The symptoms may be only slight
at first, but they are a warning. A person
is apt to think they will wear off, or per-
haps may seek some palliative Just for im-
mediate relief. In a short time the symp-
toms again appear. It is now time for ac-
tive treatment. Palliatives only serve to mask
the disease, the destruction goes on. The
warning may be in the shape of headaches
Fig. 1), which may be throbbing or aching;
hollow eyes (Fig. 2). or you may notice dots
before the eyes; coated tongue (Fig. 3); pal-
pitation of the heart (Fig. 4), weakness in
arms and legs (Figs. 5-8), impaired digestion
(Fig. 6), or pain and weakness in the back
(Fig. 7). Other symptoms that may be present
are twitching of the muscles, nervousness,
lack of energy. loss of appetite, general weak-
ness, sleeplessness and dizzy spells.
If you notice one or more of the above symp-
toms be warned and don't allow yourself to
go on and on until you are a nervous wreck.
A disorder of the nervous system will affect
the entire organism, because the nerves are
distributed to all of the organs of the body.
Your stomach, your liver, your bowels, your
heart, all t*ccme affected In time.

a radical remedy, a remedy that will .reach
the cause of the trouble and correct the various
effects at the same time. Such a remedy Is

will correct the effects. Hudyan will cure

Oakland's New Grounds Are to Be
Opened With a Regular League
Game Next Sunday Morn
ing.
The California League is organized on
good lines this season, with six evenly
matched clubs, and the teams are playing
higher class ball than has ever been
played on the coast this early in the sea-
Ffin. No better evidence of the evenness
<if the league clubs for championship hon
ors is necessary than the result of last
Sunday's game in San Francisco. Had
the locals won the game they would be
at the head of the list and Watsonville
at the tail end. As the result of the
game was reversed, the Watsonvilles are
now leaders and the San Franciscans tail
enders. the other four teams all being
tied for second place. This forecasts a
hot struggle and an even race during the
season, with every game bitterly con
tested. Following is the percentage of the
teams:

"Pop" Swett. the old-time favorite with
the local Bhouters, has been drawn Into
the game again after four years' retire
ment, and has been signed by Harris as
catcher. This settles the receivership for
the San Franciscos, for with Swett in
anything like his old form he will make
the best of them hustle to keep in his
class. Swett was first brought into the
professional ranks by Harris, who signed
him to catch for the old Havorlys in
l^vs 89. Prior to that he had been playing
with semi-professional and amateur
teams here, this being his native town.
In 1890 "Top" caught for the Bostons,
but returned to California at the close of
tho season, and for the next three yean
wore the mask for the San Franciscos.
In 1804 and IS9- r > he caught for Nashville,
in the Southern league, and since then
he has devoted his attention to private
pursuits. At present Swett. although in
the best of health and strong as an ox, is
about thirty pounds overweight, but he
has already gone into active training and
every morning takes a fifteen or twenty
mile fog out to the Cliff and along the
beach. In the afternoons he is the first
member of the team to show up for prac
tice and is rapidly getting into form. His
;irm is strong and his throwing to base
is sure. Swett will not participate In this
week's series at Sacramento, as it will
tnko him about ten days to get into per
fect condition; but will go into the game
against Srin Jose on the 24th.
That the local team has been badly
handicapped so far this season was ap
parent to all after Sullivan went behind
the bat last Sunday. His catching and
throwing were in marked contrast to
Hartman's work, and with Swett in the
team the locals ought to make a hot com
bination. After the change last Sunday
the team braced up and played a won
derfully fast game, but it was too late
to avert defeat. Sullivan will do the
catching this week.
It requires some little time for the old
timers like Borchers and Harper to get
down to their best work. Both of these
pitchers have been in harness about
twelve years and their muscles are not as
f-upple as the youngsters'. In a month
from now, however, they will hit their
proper gait, and then most of the "kids"
will receive some valuable lessons in tho
art of twirling. â¢ .
Cal Ewing has signed Russell as change
pit.her for Oakland and hereafter will
play Mosklman permanently at first.
Donovan and Hammond, who were In
jured In the last game Oakland played
here, have recovered and reported for
duty. The team will have Its regular
men Saturday and Sunday.

for Oakland, attempted to get gay with
Manager Ewing. but got his release in
stead. Several times of late Borland
failed to appear for practice, which did
not go with Cal. Borland has been a dis
appointment from the start. He was
signed because of his supposed ability as
a hitter, but he has proven woefully in
efficient in that respect, and besides his
fielding has not been of the sensational
order.
Oakland's new grounds will be opened
next Sunday morning with a game be
tween Oakland and Santa Cruz. Here
after the teams playing here in the after
noon will play a regular league game at
Oakland on Sunday mornings.
Iberg was a disappointment to his ad
mirers last Sunday. He fielded his posi
tion poorly and his delivery was not up
to his work of last season. His eye is still
troublesome, though in a week or two he
will doubtless be as effective as ever.
ODea of San Jose has entirely recover
ed from his long l.mess and will be in
this week's games with his team. ODea
has a reputation as a cnacher that dis
counts Dalrymple. May heaven help
those with sensitive nerves when they
get on the coaching lines together.
Donlin. the Santa Cruz pitcher, is a ter
ror to opposing batsmen. He uses all the
curves, has plenty of speed, and. being a
left-hander, ne uses a sharp inshoot that
is most baffling. His one weakness is his
lack of control at times.
Sacramento has a remarkably strong
fielding team, but so far this season It
has shown up rather weak at bat. Hits
are what win games, and the Senators
will have to laoe the ball out oftener If
they expect to cut any figure in the cham
pionship. They are big enough to tear a
ball to nieces with the stick.

Jim McDonlad received a dispatch from
Nick Young last Sunday ordering him to
report at Philadelphia ai once for umpire
duty with the big league. Accordingly
Jim started East Monday night McDon
ald did not go East in ti'nn- for the open
ing of the season because of an attempt
to juggle with his salary, which be would
not allow. When the double umpire sys
tem was adopted in the National League
some cheap men were engaged at com
paratively small salaries to pass judg
ment on base plays, the regular umpires
deciding balls and strikes. An attempt
was made to cut the latter's salaries to
the figure received by ?h<- others. Mc-
Donald, who Is considered the best umpire
in the. country, would not accept the re
duction and refused to report for duty
until Young came to his terms.
The owners of the Watsonville team
have ended their petty squabbles and now
the greatest harmony prevails, with the
result that the team is at the head of the
class.
Pace and Clarke are loading in hittiner
in Santa Cruz. Clarke has made the only
two homo runs in the league thus far.
The San Jose team Is well worthy of all
the good things that have been said of it.

not played a ragged game this season,
those It has lost being by the narrowest oc
margins. â

OUR CROP REPORTS.
CROP reports carefully collected by The Call
from all sections of the State and published on
Wednesday are of a character to justify the
most sanguine expectations of a prosperous year. All
varieties of crops are reported to be in a flourishing
condition in almost every county. It is only here and
there that any falling oft from a normal yield is
feared.
It now appears the rains of March came in ample
time to save hay, grain, fruit, grapes, sugar beets and
all other staple crops. The outlook is at this time a
promising one for all rural industries. Something of
the abundant prosperity which the State has not en
joyed since the free trade panic of 1893 set in is likely
to be ours this season. We have the prospect of good
prices as well as of good crops, for the remarkable
revival of industrial activity in the East has put the
people of that section into a condition of prosperity
that will enable them to be liberal consumers of Cali
fornian products.
By the collection of these reports The Call has been
first to furnish the business world with anything like
a comprehensive review of the crop prospects of the
season. The publication was, therefore, one of the
most important news items of the day and of great
value to the commercial community. It afforded a
sure foundation for a hopeful outlook for all lines of
trade. We are evidently going to have an active
business year all round. The abounding prosperity
of which we have had so many reports from the East
will flow out upon this coast and California will have
her full share of its blessings.
THE COUNTRYâ NOT PARTY.
THE Chronicle does not serve the country or
the Republican party by its frequent disserta
tions in favor of embalmed beef. It constantly
aims to create the impression that the comments of
the press and the strong feeling among the people
against fraudulent contractors originated in and have
been fostered by the Democrats of the country and
tha* they tend to injure the interests of farmers and
etock-raisers.
This position is untenable and, to the extent *f "its
influence, injurious to the administration and to the
Republican party. General Miles, who first used the
expression that has itself become embalmed, merely
performed an official duty in a manner that has ar
rested public attention. As the testimony before the
investigating commission has accumulated it has been
scrutinized and discussed by leading Republican
journal":. The issue is not partisan, but neces>arily
and properly excites the deepest interest among pa
triotic citizens of all occupations and of all grades of
poverty or wealth.
There could be no worse crime than for a ring of
contractors, aided by public officials, to line their own
pockets by feeding our soldiers and our sailors on
rotten meat and adding the unnecessary perils of
manufactured disease to the horrors of war. It is not
our function to anticipate the findings of the commis
sion, which will be approved or condemned as they
may deserve when promulgated and compared with
the evidence. But the Chronicle misconceive? the na
ture of the charges that are now sub judice. It is not
claimed that unwholesome canned or refrigerated
beef is exported to the markets of the world, but that
refuse, which ought to have been condemned, and
would not have been offered in private trade, was
considered good enough for the men who were fight
ing our battles. There is certainly evidence tending
to show that much of the beef was not spoiled in its
transmission or after its arrival in Cuba, but before it
started. There was one explosion of canned beef at
Washington that left an indelible impression upon the
puMic mind.
There is no danger that one of the "chief indus
tries" of the country will be crushed, but there is a
prospect that deep-seated corruption may be exposed
and punished. Questions of common honesty, ques
tions touching the sensitiveness of the people in re
spect to their army and their navy, cannot be appro
priated by any political organization. The adminis
tration does not occupy and cannot be forced to
occupy the position of indorsing the frauds of con
factors if they have been satisfactorily proved. The
Chronicle may easily discover a better method of at
testing its fidelity to Republican principles and to
American honor.
The people of the United States appear to be in
that position where everybody wants to shake hands
with them. The Berlin Post now expresses the hope
that a German-American alliance is not among the
improbabilities.
GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS.
PERSONS who are familiar with the various
theories upon which have been predicated
changes in the social state, alleged to be de
sirable, will recognize a jumble of those theories in
the Examiner plan for Government ownership by
Government thrift. Collectivism, nationalizing of
property, Gronlund's co-operative commonwealth,
and all of the schemes for a social state reduced to the
level of the least energetic members of that state, are
reflected or refracted in this plan.
Civilization has come about through the desire of
man to own property as his individual possession. It
was this desire in the plain people that finally over
came the feudal system, with its brilliant panorama of
knights and ladies, its pomp and circumstance, its al
luring pageantry. This desire destroyed feudal
tenure, strucli the iron collar from men's necks, made
them the owners of their own persons, and intro
duced the wage system as the necessary privilege of
freemen, who, owning their own capacity to labor,
must have the right to take pay for its use. This en
franchisement of man and his rise out of the feudal
system was the leaven which has finally worked out
the destruction of chattel slavery as applied generally
to the black race. Individuality, the exultation of
man in owning himself, and the exaltation of his
faculties in the effort to become the owner of prop
erty, real and personal, to enjoy life and liberty and
the pursuit of happiness, moved the nations to brand
the slave trade as piracy and slavery as a denial of
the rights of man.
In modern nations, starting at the strongest and
most important Governments, as we approach those
that govern less and interfere in the business and
personal matters of the people to the minimum we
find man rising in the scale with the widening of his
opportunities. As he governs himself more, and be
comes every year richer and more important, and is
governed externally less, his opportunity to rise and
advance by the power of personal character is ex
hibited in a general gain in the scale of living, the
enrichment of life, the conversion of the rare luxuries
of one generation into the common comforts of the
next.
The best and broadest opportunities of man have
been afforded in this republic, under its wise and well
tried constitution, and the social state that has been
founded on the civil state which that constitution
creates.
The great individual fortunes of which the Ex
aminer complains are merely the result of the oppor
tunities furnished to man in this republic. During
the last thirty years peasant immigrants have come to
us from Europe in the steerage and by immigrant
train, and, applying their individual qualities and per
sistence to the better opportunities they find here,
have found themselves, before middle age is reached,
able to revisit their European birthplace, traveling in
a Pullman and the first cabin of an ocean steamer.
It is not a matter of surprise that a country which
has given to so many the experience of this advance
in fortune and rise in condition should present the
spectacle of numerous immense fortunes, every one
founded originally in the self-denial, economy and
thrift of a man whose qualities were inspired to high
action by the invitation of opportunity. Nor is it
surprising that in the midst of these opportunities, of
which the vast majority have taken advantage to their
own betterment, there are some who lack the char
acter and quality to do so. These are the failures, the
disinherited of fortune, in whose name the social
state is impeached. The Examiner proposes such
change in the civil and social state as shall bring both
down to the plane of energy of these failures. As
they cannot compete with the energetic, cannot make a
cay's march with the strong, cannot equal in thrift
and accumulation the enterprising, sober and indus
trious, all incitement and inducement to individual
energy, strength, industry, sobriety and thrift must
be taken away and substituted by Government owner
ship of all productive property and enterprises and the
transaction of all business by the Government 1
It is admitted that this plan will make the indi
vidual ownership of property impossible, and so will
eradicate the energy, foresight and other qualities in
man which have been* actuated by the desire of such
ownership. The vast majority of active men in the
country who have thrived by individual energy and
character will be reduced to the level of the minority
who have failed to thrive through the lack of char
acter and energy. The new civil and social state will
be founded upon the moral, industrial and physical
diseases and disorders and failures of the present state,
and no prophecy is needed to foretell the result.
Man having risen in the struggle for existence
against the resistance of nature and environment, if
relieved %of the necessity of such struggle by being
cosseted in the arms of a wealthy and important Gov
ernment, will lose what he has gained by exertion,
and with the loss of opportunity will lose all those
high capacities- which it invited into exercise.
Life is a great advantage. It is through life that
we enjoy all of the physical world around us. The
beauties of the morning and the evening, the glories
of high noon and the soothing mysteries of the night,
are ours because we are alive. But to many these
exquisite pleasures that we enjoy because we are alive
are not available by reason of illness, or the period of
their enjoyment is shortened by death. Shall it be
said, therefore, that none shall enjoy the opportuni
ties of the physical world to any greater degree than
those who are ill, and that the period of their en
joyment by all shall be shortened to the length of the
briefest lives?
Such a policy would be the precise analogue of the
proposition to take away all material opportunity
from every individual because some have used it to
gather much and others have failed to gather any.
SPEAKER REED'S RETIREMENT.
REPORTS of Speaker Reed's intention to retire
from Congress have been current for a long
time, and, while they have been generally dis
credited, they now come from what seems an authori
tative source. Mr. Reed himself has not spoken di
rectly upon the subject, no letter from him resigning
his seat has been made public, but the activity of the
canvass for the succession to the Speakership gives
reason for believing that his friends are assured of
his determination.
There has been much speculation as to the motives
which have prompted Mr. Reed to retire from a posi
tion of so much power and importance, and which
he has filled with such distinguished success. It is
asserted by some that, being a comparatively poor
man, Mr. Reed desires to engage in lucrative business
so as to provide himself with a competence for his old
age. Others assert the views of the Speaker are so
antagonistic to those of the administration on many
important issues that a conflict would be unavoidable
if he retained the Speakership, and that he prefers to
resign rather than to divide his party.
Whatever may be the motive, it is certain the re
tirement of Mr. Reed is an event of great moment to
cur politics. He is in many respects the strongest
individual in American political life to-day, and his
influence upon Congress has been for years of so
THE SAN FKAKCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1899.
I
potent a character that he has to a large extent dic
tated the course of legislation. It is to him we owe
the policy which has transformed the House of Rep
resentatives from a turbulent debating society to a
legislative body, performing its work with accuracy
and dispatch. To him also is due the defeat of many
a wild, ill-considered measure, the adoption of which
might have seriously compromised the welfare of the
country.
Since neither the President nor the Speaker has
ever given sanction to the reports of antagonism be
tween them, that phase of the situation need not be
discussed. It is certain, however, that Mr. Reed has
been all along in opposition to the jingoes and im
perialists of Congress, and was a conservative force of
great value. Some time ago, in a noted article pub
lished in one of the popular magazines, Mr. Reed
said with reference to the craze for annexing islands,
"Empire can wait," and on that principle he has con
sistently acted. The annexationists have been attack
ing him for some time past with more or less vin
dictiveness, and have undoubtedly formed a faction
opposed to his re-election to the Speakership. It is
not likely, however, that he would resign to avoid
their antagonism, for he has little cause to fear them,
and, moreover, he is the kind of man who never gets
out of the way of an enemy.
If the reports prove true, and Mr. Reed retires from
politics, the course of the coming session of Congress
will be watched with a good deal of anxiety. Many
issues are to be dealt with on which Republicans are
by no means united. It will require a masterful hand
to wisely direct the House of Representatives next
winter, and there will be much regret if Tom Reed is
not there to undertake it.
THE LfJTE SAMUEL G. HILBORN.
THE death of Samuel G. Hilborn is deeply re
gretted not only in California, where he was best
known and appreciated, but throughout the
Union. He had acquired a national reputation by his
conspicuous service as a member of the Committee
on Naval Affairs of the House of Representatives
during the late war with Spain. He had endeared
himself to all citizens who were familiar with his
record by his industry, by his intelligence and by
his unswerving rectitude.
As a man, as a citizen, as a leading member of fra
ternal orders, and through the manner of his perform
ance of public duties, he had earned general com
mendation and respect. There was nothing sensa
tional in his career, for he had no itching for mere
notoriety, but identified himself with substantial ques
tions and with solid work.
The State of Maine was his birthplace, and after he
had graduated at Tufts College he acted as a school
teacher and at the same time qualified himself for the
practice of law. His experience as an educator led
him to realize the importance to good citizenship of
sound American training and to devote special atten
tion to the common schools of his country. When
he settled in Vallejo, in 1861, and began active pro
fessional life, he soon became known as a safe ad
viser who, though not possessing any special gifts of
oratory, carefully prepared his cases and attended to
the interests of his clients. His relations with the
public began a few years after he reached Vallejo,
when he became a municipal trustee and a member
of the Board of Education. His rise was gradual but
steady â he never retrograded, but constantly pro
gressed. His success as a county Supervisor caused
his election to the State Senate, where he distin
guished himself by his mastery of the intricate de
tails of railroad freights and fares and by his abso
lute fidelity to his trust. He labored hard as a mem
ber of the convention that framed the constitution of
1879, and conservatively resisted all its sandlot fea
tures and opposed its adoption at the polls. In 1883
he was appointed United States Attorney for this dis
trict and served his term with honor to himself and
with advantage to the Government His first election
tc Congress was to fill a vacancy in 1892, but he was
unseated. He was afterward twice elected and repre
sented his district during the exciting contest against
the railroad funding bill, which he was largely instru
mental in defeating, and in the excessive labor caused
by the late war, which probably contributed to the
disease to which he has now succumbed.
Mr. Hilborn had a commanding presence, and he
was a fine example of genuine Americanism, un
alloyed by any treacheries to the great ideas incor
porated in our Government. He was true to himself,
true to his family, true to his country, and he passed
away at a ripe age honored and admired and leaving
an influence for good that cannot fail beneficially to
affect the rising generation.
Arkansas proposes to provide herself with a new
and splendid Capitol, and has decided to erect it on
the site now occupied by the penitentiary, which will
be torn down to make way for it, and thus we see
how things go from bad to worse â where once thieves
were kept in confinement they are now to be turned
loose upon the State treasury and paid for robbing it.
General Shafter says that the only way in which
we can persuade the Filipinos that we are a nation of
well-meaning, God-fearing, man-loving people is by
killing half the native population of the Philippines.
And General Shafter knows that we have just given
Spain a sound thrashing for trying to do the same
thing.
Police Commissioner Gunst wants to leave the
State for six months. Strange as it may seem, some
of the Supervisors were adverse to granting the Com
missioner's request. If the worthy members of the
board could only discover some means to prevent the
Commissioner getting back again they might justify
their official existence.
After all the jesting and the jibing about the
Bryanite JefFcrsonians, a dollar dinner is not so cheap
a feast after all. It may provide but a 6cant repast in
New York, but in San Francisco a man can get all
he can eat and nearly all he can drink for that money.
The next time the Philippine Commission has a
proclamation which it wishes to make known to the
people it should advertise it in the newspapers. This
thing of sending soldiers out on a bill-posting expe
dition is too costly, and never yields good results.
C. P. Huntington graciously announces that in two
or three years the Southern Pacific Company may be
building railroads in the Philippines. There are some
evils from which even the Filipinos should be spared.
The Southern Pacific is one of them.
Huntington says that when he makes a move he
knows what he is after. Californians are wondering
when the old gentleman will make his next move. He
seems to have seized everything worth taking in the
State.
The people of Oakland are trying to make the
Southern Pacific Company keep faith. This taking
up of the white man's burden is becoming a serious
affair. The people of Oakland ought to tackle some
thing easy.
SEWERS IN THE
MISSION WERE
TALKED ABOUT
Subject Taken Up by
Street Committee.
WILL MEET AGAIN TO-DAY
,
TWO CONSULTING ENGINEERS
TO BE APPOINTED.
.One Will Probably Be Rudolph Her
ring, Who Planned the Sewer
Systems of Many Large
Eastern Cities.
The Street Committee of thÂ» Board of
Supervisors met yesterday afternoon and
devoted much of their timo to the dis
cussion of tho Mission sewer project.
Mayor Phelan and John C. Quinn and
A. S. Baldwin, representing the Mer
chants' Association, were present to con
sult with the members of the committee.
Several plans involving tho appointment
and compensation of a sewer commission
were discussed, but the Supervisors failed
to arrive at any definite conclusion.
Messrs. Manson, Grunsky and Tilton,
who have been suggested to serve as a
commission, were not present, but tho
City Surveyor was represented by Mr.
Mosey.
The members of the Street Committee
held an informal meeting Wednesday
night and virtually agreed to appoint two
consulting engineers to assist the commis
sion In Us work. Rudolph Herring, the
famous engineer, under whose supervis
ion the sewer systems of Washington,
Chicago and Philadelphia were put in,
will probably be employed as one of the
consulting engineers. The gentleman is
at present In Honolulu, but he will be
hack here before any work on the pro
posed project is under way. Colonel Men
dell will in all probability be also selected
to act as one of the consulting engineers.
The matter of compensation to be allot
ted the commission for the performance
of its work was gone into and after a
discussion lasting an hour or more the
committee was no nearer an agreement
than before the subject was first
broached. Messrs. Grunsky and Manson
have already informed the Street Com
mittee that they would furnish the city
with a complete plan for a new system
and an estimate of its cost within five
months for the sum of $16,000. That
amount includes the cost of surveying the
ground, field work, other expenses and
the compensation of the two commis
sioners. As the committee and the Mayor
and, in fact, everybody who has thus
far evinced an interest in the project,
feel that it is necessary in order to ex
pedite the labors of the commission to
appoint two consulting engineers to assist
the commission it will be necessary, of
course, to set aside an additional sum
to compensate the engineers for their la
bors.
Not knowing what portion of the Â§18,000
requested by Messrs. tirunsky and Man
son is for compensation, the commit lea
was unable to settle the question, and tho
Mayor suggested that another meeting be
held this afternoon at 4 o'clock at his of
fice in the City Hall to uetermine upon a
sum to be set aside for the performance
of tht work.
Clerk Russell and Supervisor Algreltink
er then pointed nut the fact that the
committee would have to devise wa/s and
means to raise funds to carry on the work i
and there was at present no m.mey in tha
treasury for that purpose. Supervisor Hol
land suggested that a certain portion of
the money be set aside immediately to be
used by the commission in field work and
other necessary labors, and that the re
mainder be provided for in the tax levy
for the next fiscal year. This knotty
problem provoked an interesting discus
sion on the condition of the different
funds. A. S. Baldwin suggested tha*
enough money to start the commission on
Its labors could be taken from tne urgent
necessity fund, and the Mayor informed
him that the fund was depleted every
month by the many demands that are
constantly made upon it.
Cyril Williams, export of the Finance
Committee, was ordered to be present at
the meeting to be held this afternoon
armed with a statement of the condition
of different available funds.
The committee received a letter from
Joseph Ilowell. in which that gentleman
generously offered to perform his duties

from Henry T. Scott, vice-president of the
Union Works, and from the Mayor, Su

TAKEN FROM IN FRONT OF MER

Lawsuit Probable Over the Loss of

Man Hurt on the Pacific
Mail Dock.
A large party of Congressmen, United
States and State officials and their friends
went on an excursion around the bay on
the State tug Governor Markham yester
day. The affair was In honor of Con
gressman Clark of New Hampshire, and
among the guests were Senator Perkins,
Congressman Julius Kahn, Special Agents
of the Treasury Linck and Smith, Col
lector of the Port Jackson, Surveyor of
the Port Spear, Deputy Surveyor Chaun
cey Milton St. John, Harbor Commission-
ers Kilburn. Harney and Herold. It was
the intention to have gone out on the
revenue cutter Golden Gate, but as that
vessel is laid up for an overhauling the
Harbor Commissioners kindly placed the
Governor Markham at the disposal of the
party.
After visiting a few points of Import
ance in the northern portion of the bay,
the Markham was headed back for Fol
som street, and there the party got a
splendid view of the departure of the
transports Warren and Scandia. From
there the Markham went to the Union
Iron Works and Hunters Point and then
back to her dock. The excursionists had
a most enjoyable time, as the day was a
perfect one for an outing on the water.
R. D. Chandler, the well-known mine
owner and coal merchant, was mourning
the loss of a trotter in the 2:30 class, a
brand new set of harness and buggy and
a lap robe and whip yesterday morning,
but later in the day his grief was some
wheat assuaged by the return of the horse
fun] buggy. The other articles are still
missing.
The entire outfit was in service for the
first time. When the ship Louis WaJsh,
With a cargo of coal from the Sound for
Mr. Chandler, was sighted Captain Jessen
and E. Pollexfen, one of Mr. Chandler's
clerks, grot into the buggy and drove to
the Merchants' Exchange to find out
about what time the vessel would get in.
They were not in the building five min
utes, but when they got out on the side
walk again the horse and buggy were
gone. The matter was at once reported to
the Harbor police, and they ascertained
that a horse and buggy similar to the
missing ones had started for Oakland on
the creek steamer. The horse was driven
by a young man, and with him was a
young" lady. The Oakland police wore
notified and the young man was interro
gated or. the other side. He was able to
prove conclusively that the horse and
buggy were his, so that clew vanished.
About an hour aftor the creek route
episode one of Mr. Chandler's customers
on the corner of Washington and Stock
ton streets telephoned that a blind alley
noar his place was barricaded with a bug
gy bearing Mr. Chandler's name and that
inside the barricade was a horse. It was
the stolen rig, but the harness, lap robe
and whip were gone, and Detective Ellis
Is now on the trail of them and the
thieves.
The steamer Rio de Janeiro sailed for
the Orient yesterday. She had quite a
number of passengers and every available
inch of space, including some of the
staterooms, was crowded with freight.

to-day, after which she will go alongside
the auxiliary cruiser Badger and fill her
bunkers. The Nero will sail Saturday for
Honolulu, from which point she will begin
taking soundings for a cable between here
and Hawaii. The Badger will leave Mon
day with the United States, German and
British commissioners for Samoa.
Bernard Mcdonagle got his back hurt
and his scalp torn on the Mail dock yes
terday afternoon. A runaway team
knocked MoGonagle senseless. Ho was

There is going to be a lawsuit over the
loss of the schooner R. W. Bartleu's
rudder. As told exclusively in The Call
the vessel was towed to sea by the Sea
Queen, but before the schooner was cast
out It was discovered that her rudder was
gone. The Sea Queen then towed her
back to port and the tugboat company
demands the price of an extra tow. The
owners of the Bartlett assert that it was
the tug's tow rope that pulled the rudder
out of the vessel, and so the chances are
the matter will be adjusted In court.
COMPLAINT
OF A SAILOR
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
My son, John Collins, has been in the
United States navy for three years and
seven months. He enlisted at this port,
which is his home, from which he
sailed. He was on the Philadelphia, and
from her was transferred to the Balti
more, and was on that vessel, which
so distinguished herself during the bat
tle of Manila. He is still with Dewey
though hi 3 term of enlistment expired
seven months ago. The latter time
was put in for the "good of the ser
vice," as they call it. Now he can
come home and he wants to very much.
He writes me from on board the
United States steamship Buffalo, Ma
nila, March 7, and say?, among other
things: "We were informed to-day if
we wanted to go East to New York
and waive all transportation we could
go on this one (the Buffalo), but if we
wait three or four months longer we
can go home on the Solace. So I have
decided to go on this one and pay my
way home overland to San Francisco.
It will be about sixty days before I
reach home from this date. This ship
is a madhouse."
Now, Mr. Editor, a criminal, when
released from the penitentiary, is given
a good suit of clothes and transporta
tion back to the place from which he
was convicted. I ask if it is proper to
land my boy and others so far from
home and compel them to pay the rail
road company their hard-earned money
to get to see their fathers, mothers, sis
ters, -wives or brothers after their long
and faithful service to their country.
My son is a fireman and stood to the
furnaces in the battle when the ther
mometer ran up to 170 degrees. One
greater than I has said that such men
are as great heroes as the man on the
bridge. Yours truly.

ple of this city, the press and the Or

how you would be pleased with my work,

MEN'S LESSON
IN MORALITY
The Call's Crusade for
Decency.
ENDS IN COMPLETE SUCCESS
JUDGE GRAHAM VIEWS THE IN
DECENT PICTURES.
He Convicts Kollman and LÂ«vy and
Orders Them to Appear for
Sentence This Morn
ing.
The crusade of The Call against the ex
hibition of Indecent pictures in phono
graph parlors has been brought to a suc
cessful issue, all the proprietors of par
lors having been convicted and warned
that a repetition of the offense would be
severely punished.
In acting Police Judge Barry's court
John Collins was the first one to be con
victed and fined; then followed Peter
Bacigalupi, and yesterday M. Kollman,
848 Market street, the last of the trio ar
rested by Policemen Tyrrell and Esola on
instructions from Captain Spillane, was
similarly dealt with.
When the case of Kollman was called
his attorney, J. E. Bien, said that as far
as he was concerned the case was sub
mitted. He would like to add that the
defendant was going out of the business.
The Judge said that in his opinion the
pictures exhibited were suggestively im
moral, and he would impose a fine of $10,
as in the other two cases, but if the of
fense were repeated the maximum pen
alty would be imposed.
The cases of Kollman and M. S. Levy,
415 Kearny street, who were arrested on
the complaint of Frank J. Kane of the
Pacific Coast Society for the Suppression
of Vice under order 2525 of the Board of
Supervisors, were called in Judge Gra
ham's court yesterday afternoon.
A machine with an ele< trie attachment
had been titted up in a room in the base
ment of the City Hall and the Judge had
an opportunity of examining the pictures
seized in the parlors of Levy. Levy was
present and persisted in protesting that
the pictures wtre works of art, and if he
had thought otherwise he would not have
exhibited them. The Judge, after he had
peeped at the pictures, remarked that
1 they were grossly immoral, and it was a
j shame that children's minds should be
I polluted by being allowed the privilege of
seeing them for a nickel.
When the Judge opened court Attorney
Birn, for the defendants, submitted the
rase on the pictures themselves, and the
Judge remarked that in his opinion they
wire grossly immoral and suggestive. He
had seen them, and they were not fit to
be displayed anywhere. He was unalter
ably opposed to anything of the kind, and
he would convict the defendants. As the
clerk of the court was not present he
would reserve sentence until this morn
ing. He ordered that the objectionable
pictures be destroyed.
Prosecuting Attorney Wrntworth con
curred with the Judge in his opinion of
the character of the pictures, and had no
hesitation in saying that they were
gm=sly immoral.
The minimum, penalty under the ordi
nance under which the arrests were made
is $50 and the maximum $200. It is prob
able that the Judge will impose the min
imum penalty on the condition that the
defendants promise not to offend again.

"With Mr. Miehling to think is to act
and he at onca began to look around Â£oi

Presidio were considered, but they were
rejected, as if the exercises were held in

etc., being needed, and by charging an
admission fee of 10 cents for adults it Is
believed a BUfficlent sum i an be realised
to equip them all and leave a surplus for
future, necessities. Mr. Mi. -tiling finally
decided that Glen Park offered the most
facilities and he proceeded to learn on
what terms it could be secured. He was
prepared to divide the receipts with the
owners of the park, but when he ex
plained his scheme to Mi Baldwin the
latter at once informed him that lie could
have the park for thing and welcome.
Superintendent Webster was next vis
ited by Mr. Miehling, who explained his
project ami requested the former to use
his influence with the Board of Educa
tion to obtain the necessary permission.
Mr. Webster's enthusiasm was aroused in
an instant and the permission was had for
the asking. Nothing remains now but to
arrange the preliminaries to insure the
success of the greatest picnic ever given
the little folks in San Francisco. But one
of the most Important matters is the ques
tion of transportation. As many of the
children .are not overburdened with nickels
and dimes it is hoped the street railroad
companies will carry them to the park
free, thus enabling nil to â  tend.
A committee to be appointed by the
principals of all the schools will take
charge of the gate receipts; which will be
divided equally among the schools. Other
committees will have charge of the vari
ous booths which will be erected on the
grounds. Superintendent Webster Is pre
paring a circular to the principals invok
ing rheir aid to make the affair a great
success. All the arrangements will be in
the hands of the teachers. They will at
tend to all the advertising and there will
I c no money wasted in the employment of
managers <>r promoters.
The drill will take place in the forenoon,
so that the children may devote all the
afternnn to play. The drill promises to be
a trrand spectacle, as the proficiency of
thf pupils is too well known to admit of
the possibility of failure. Mr. Miehling has
charge of thirty-five schools, with an aver
age of a thousand pupils in each school
so that it will not be difficult for him to
gather together ten thousand and put
them through a course of military exer
cises for ho delectation of d ml ring pa
rents ami friends.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL2I, 1899*
I. J. TRUMAN IS
FOUND GUILTY
OF CONTEMPT
Refused to Obey an
Order of Court.
FINE AND IMPRISONMENT
SUCH IS THE JUDGMENT OF [
JUDGE COOK.
A Stay of Five Days Was Granted, j
However, That the Matter May
Be Taken to the Supreme
Court.
Treasurer I. J. Truman has technically
been placed In the custody of the Sheriff
for contempt of court for having refused
to obey an order made by Judge Cook
directing: him to pay the demands of ;
Stenographer Jospph P. Stevens. For his !
contempt of the order of court a fine of '<
$5 is also imposed upon the Treasurer, but i
by grace of all Interested parties a stay j
of execution of five days is granted that j
the matter may be carried before the |
Supreme Court, now sitting in Los An- :
geles.
The contempt proceedings against Tru
man came op for hearing before Judge
t'o..k on Wednesday. Truman appeared
the court with his counsel, J. H.
Dickinson, the prosecution being repre
sented by George 1Â». Collins. Truman
tiled his answer to the order to show
cause and the court proceeded to the
hearing, it was contended on behalf of
Truman that the fund set aside for the
payment of criminal court stenographers
had been exhausted and no moneys were
available to meet Stevens' demand. Col
lins contested this theory, citing various
authorities substantiating his contention
that the Treasurer had no alternative but
to pay the demand if it wen regularly
Issued, which proved to be the fact in
this case.
The case was then submitted for dccl- [
si'iti and yesterday at noon Judge Cook
Bled his findings. After going over the
various legal matters involved Judge
Cook concludes:
"It Is ordered that the respondent. I. J.
Truman, be and he is hereby adjudged
guilty of a contempt of the authority of
this court in refusing to obey Its order of
April 8, I^9. and as a punishment for his
contempt he is ordered to pay Into court
a fine of $5. and It being yet In his power
to perform the act lie is directed to make
the payment of the sum of $117, and is
hereby ordered into the custody of the
Sheriff, to be confined and Imprisoned In
the County Ja.il of the city and county ol
San Francisco until he obeys the order
of court as stated."
Upon the decision of the court a war
rant of commitment was issue. i which
placed the Treasurer at the disposal of
the Sheriff, but by consent of all parties
Truman was allowed his freedom for five
days that the highest court of the State
might pass upon the legality of th.j deci
sion.
LEES TELLS HOW HE
STOPPED GAMBLING
ON 1 THE STAND IN THE RACE
TRACK CASE.
He and Attorney Ach Occupied the
Morning Session Exchanging
Compliments of a Dubious
Nature.
The nth of March and the happenings
; of that dayâ the most eventful, even
i though sad, in the history of th. Pacific
Coast Jockey Club- underwent a thorough
( autopsy before Judge Murasky yesterday
; during the hearing of the action of the
j racing corporation against Chief I,ees
I and his nun to restrain them from ar
i resting poolsellers -within [ngleside
; track "without due process of law."
chief Lees was put on the stand at the
opening of the day's session and continued
his testimony regarding tue manner in
which his force went through the g
and put a Stop to lawlessness. It was a
case of "bullyrag" all the forenoon. Lees
and Attorney Ach, who represents the
<lub. did not get along at all. J,ees want
ed t'> explain matters brought out in
question anil answer form, but Ach was
obdurate. Finally the ( hlef lost his tem
per and ordered Ach to "act like a genii. -
man." Then Ach gave It back to Lees,.
and so it went. talk, argue, quarrel, ob
ject and except. The result of all the i
difficulty was Plmpl'- to prove by the Chief
that in obedience to an ordinance passed
by the Supervisors prohibiting poolselling
li.- went to the track and despite all pro
tests closed out the bookies.
when Lees left the stand Captain Witt
man was put on the stand ana the same
BCi lie was re-enactedâ the same testimony
and proof were forthcoming. Ach Is anx
ious to get all the "evil acts of the po
lice" In the record from their own lips,
and if their acts of putting a stop to
gambling are "evil acts," then he is suc
ceeding splendidly. If such acts were
lawful, then his labors will go for naught.
When Wlttmnn left the stand the case
was continued for further hearing.

NBLSON A. MILEB,
Major General <'>mmandlng.
President Butchers' Board of
Tradi . fc>an Francisco, Cal.
The forngoinp letter of Nelson A. Miles
to President Hammond of the Butchers'
Board of Trade leads up to an interest
ins: story.
The (Sovernmont's purchase of 1,500,000
i"-uin<if! of dressed beef for the soldiers at
Manila, as reported in a recent tele
graphic dispatch, has created a mild son
.â -.iti.m among the meat men of this city.
The further Information that twelve car
-Im,-c!s ur about 800 dressed beeves were
already en xoute to this city to he shipped
to the Philippines has aroused a great
deal of unfavorable comment.
It is claimed by many that the car
casses aro lirinK forwarded in an "om
balmed" state by the very firms who
Ffnt their unwholesome m<>;..t to Santiago.
The further fact that the heavy order was
placed with Kansas Â«'ity ftrma instead
of with local moat dealers has caused
many inquiries to be made V>y butchers
as to why this was done when this city
is on the PeabOard and Kansas City is in
the interior.
Samuol C. Harhmond, president "f the
Butchers' Board of Trade ami a member
of the well-known firm of Hammond .<c
Brod. discussed the subject at length yes
terday. He read the dispatch and l><Mnt;
vitally Interested In the matter he- m-.iA*
an Investigation on his own account and
rendered an opinion without any hesita
tion.
"The meat to be shipped from here,"
he Said, "is bandied in the same manner
nnd by the same (inns thai sent the 'em
balmed' btVf to the soldiers at Santiago,
and in my opinion the experience with it
in Manila will not be any better than In
Cuba.
"'Embalmed,' as applied to beef, was
first used in this city about six years ago
to describe an odor ami taste which be
longed peculiarly to meal killed and pre-
Berved by artificial means, and le noi due
as much to the use of chemicals as it la to
the method of dressing and preserving
meat after killing cattle as la done by the
big meai trust.
â¢ T Cattle are bound to have thai odor ana
taste because Immediately on th>ir ar
rival at the abattoirs, while in a fever
ish and heated condition due to their trip
cm the cars, they are slaughtered as
quickly .-if; possible, washed In hot water
and run Into i lera with all the animal
heal still in the carcass. This is done
t-i save in weight what would be other
wise lost by the evaporation during the
first twenty-four hours, which would
amount under average conditions to from
twenty-five to forty pounds per carcass,
ami in money would represent, according
to the statement of the number killed by
one Kansas Citj hOUSi . to a .saving of
more* than HO ,OOO per month.
"The animal heat and moisture retained
in the carcass, together with the fact
that the meat i.s KÂ«jÂ«t in illy ventilated
rooms, or worse still, cars, for Quite a
length of time, is what causes that taste
which can onU be described by 'em
balmed.' After being kept more than ten
<lavs in a cooler, particularly if the tem
perature is allowed to vary more nr less
a few degrees, a 'beard' begins to form,
this 'beard' being nothing more than
"mold, 1 exactly the same as would form
on any article kept in a dark, damp place,
and is the forerunner of rapid decompo
sition and naturally adds to the vile taste
of the meal, If such a thing were possi
ble.
"It certainly serins a shame that the
Government should enter Into a contract
to supply our soldiers with more of the
same disgusting, unhealthful nuats after
the experience we have had In Cuba.
How can it be expected that it will prove
any more satisfactory or less deadly in
Manila, where the climatic conditions are
the same, if noi worse, than it did in
Santiago, an it Is prepared in exactly the
same manner and by the identical firms
in both cases.
"While a protectionist and a strong be
liever in home industries, 1 -would rather
see the meats for our soldiers bought in
Australia, where the packers are either
more honest and certainly have [ess in
fluence with our 'Major Qeneral Eagans,
or else have a more successful way of
preserving fresh killed meat. This plan
might be much better, as it would result
in giving our soldiers a chance of being
killed by Mausers and not by the ra
tions served by their own Government.
"Just -why this order for 1.50u,00<) pounds
of beef should be placed at a point so
far removed from seaboard, than on this
coast, which has produced so many cattle,
as to make the price Of beef much lower
here than in any place In the world, Aus
tralia alone possibly except! d, has, i .see,
caused much comment. On Investigation
it will be found that our herds have been
much depleted during the last two years
and to take from this market the neces
sary cattle to fill this large order would
practically cause a beet famine here and
prices would necessarily go up to a figure
unhenrd of heretofore.
"The reason of the scarcity of cattle
on this coast at the present time is due
to the drought of the last two years
During the season of 1897 a very small
amount of rain fell, and the season of
1898 was almost totally dry, there not
being enough water in the rivers to allow
irrigation to land situated so as to re
ceive it. Feed for cattle became so scarce
that a large percentage simply starved to
dearth. In some sections the loss was al
most total; in others, where convenient
to shipping points, the cattle that were
still able to move and stand the strain o t
travel were either sent by their owners to
other points where food could be obtained
or were sold to speculators at ruinous
prices. The latter then shipped them to
Nebraska and other Eastern points where
corn was selling from 8 to 10 cents per
bushel, and were there fattened and sold
on the Eastern market. The representa
tive of an Eastern dressed beef firm who
was here previous to our last copious
rains stated that he alone had bought for
his firm 18,000 head df the Starving cattle
last year and was out here again for the
same purpose. When he found we were
having a general rain he went East.
"The prices ruling here to-day are over
40 per cent higher than last year at this
time. First-class beef to-day is selling
at M 4 and 9 cents per pound, dressed
weight, as against 5Â®5^4 a year ago. In
the second grade the advance is still more
marked, as beef which could be bought
all last summer at from cents per
pound brings easily 8 cents per pound
now, a difference of fully 100 per cent.
These figures are the wholesale prices to
dealers by the whole carcass. There is
no immediate prospect of prices being any
lower, for the reason that it will take at
least two years to increase our herds to
their normal condition again. With the
abundant grass this year it will be pos
sible to maintain all the increase, and not
more will be disposed of than financial
necessities of growers require or.than will
firing satisfactory prices to the producers.
"Another reason that prices will be as
high or even still higher than at present
rule for the next three months is the fact
that though we have had enough rain to
insure good feed,, it came this year nearly
three months later than usual, and while
grass is growing nicely everywhere our
cattle are very thin and it will be at least
two to three months before even the earli
est of them are in condition to kill.
"In the meantime there are very few
cattle to supply this market, and they are
in the hands of a few firms who have
been feeding them with hay and grain at
the high prices which have bpen ruling
for the past year, anticipating this very
condition of affairs, and even they have
comparatively a small number of the one
mentioned were to be filled. There is no
question but that beef would bring very
high pricesâ at least 11G12 cents at wholfe
sale."
Chinese Immigrant Escaped.
One of the 352 Chinese passengers who
arrived on the Coptic made his escape
yesterday or the evening before from the
Quarantine station on Angel Island while
nominally in the custody of Dr. Brooks,
Federal Quarantine Officer. The remain
der were landed on the Mail dock yester
day morning and placed in custody of
Customs Surveyor Spear. Only 131 were
for San Franoisco, the remainder being in
transit for Havana, Panama and Van
couver.

DEFICIENCY IN THE CIRCULATION.
The circular of Henry Clews, under date of
New York. April 15, sa>6:
â¢â¢it U not easy to nnd any 'bear' elements in
the Wall street situation as it now stands.
Rather the position favors the prospect of a
strong market and a bullish tendency in specu
lation until the fall months. Beyond that
period, however, there are monetary possibili
ties which will need to be watched. There are i
very evident symptoms that the supply of cir- j
culatlon is falling short of the requirements of ,
our largely Increased businebs. It is true, there :
has been an increase of the money in actual
circulation the amount having risen from
Si 756.000 000 on April 1. IS9S, to $1,927,800,000 on
the first of this monthâ a gain of $171,800,000;
but of this increase $112.700,uvH) has consisted of
gold which is almost entirely unavailable for
active use in trade; so that we may say the
increase in the furms of money available for
retail transactions is only about $00, 000,0*)
within the last twelve months. This increase ia
the active circulation, outside of gold, Is at the
rate of 3.4 per cent, while the increase in the ;
transactions of the clearing houses â : th- coun
try was 4 ( >.S per cent within the same period;
whii h shown an amazing disparity between the
expansion of the active circulation and that of
the general trade of the country as expressed
ia our banking operations. There seems to be
no hnpe of the demand for more currency be
ing met through an increase of note issues by
the national banks, for during the nm quarter
of the current year the banks withdrew over
$6,000,000 of bonds deposited for circulation. The
only existing way through whi'-h this want can
t.e met is by the treasury returning to the
i3uue of gold certificates, which would have ,
the effect of giving circulation to a considerable '
rum of now idle gold. These facts demonstrate
'he necc-fstty for Congress taking up the cur
rency situation as one of the first measures I
after its assembling.
"The money situation will be materially lm- j
proved next week by the payment of the 80,
--000.000 peace treaty money to thÂ° :r,:-!i Gov
ernment, as it will come direct from the New
York suti-treasury into â¢ the New York City
banks, and it is now quite certain that bills of .
exchange will be remitted in place of forward
ing the gold, it being cheaper to do so. It is j
reported from Washington that the Secretary
will recoup the treasury gradually from the
Government funds in the national depository
r.anks at the rate of $l,ow,i)00 a week. The
banks will therefore gain $19,000,000 by thÂ«
operation, fts they will receive $29,000,000 and
only pay out $l.oort,nni) next week."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TOHK STOCK MAJRKKT.
NEW YORK, April 20.â Stocks to-day gravi
tated Rlowly below yesterday's level. Influ
ences affecting price values were the contin
ued strength and rising prices of starling ex
change and reports of damage to winter wheat.
There was some strength about the opening,
but the outside demand being email, encour
aped the boars to put out short lines, the
Belling movement being most confident around
delivery hour. The Impression on values was
very large as a rule and covering movements
left the net change of the day moderate.
Trading was of a listless sort, and although
Â»W dealings were about half a million shares,
little Interest was manifested in the uncer
tain vibrations of stocks. The railways gen
eially moved thin narrow limits. Anaconda
Mining advanced 6%, the purchases being in
f .n-.o volume for London account, where thÂ»
demand was represented to cover sales of
privileges which would be called. Among the
tpecialtiea Continental Tobacco dipped sharp
ly, closing near two points off. The Flower
stocks were under pressure, but left off with
narrow changes either way. Southern Rail
way and Louisville and Nashville, on their
Joint purchase of the Birmingham Southern
Railway, held firm against large London sales.
American Smelting and Refining opened
strong on its first day's trading in the un
listed department and then rolled down. The
market ciosed steady.
The increased activity and strength in the
bond markets reflects Investment buying, which
is very heavy in mmi of the newly issued
mortgages. Total Bales, $4,000,000. U. S. 2a

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 20.â Warm rains throughout
the Southwest, where fears of blight had pre
| vailed, together with sugnestlons of an Im-
I provement in the crop situation from other
. sections, gave wheat a weak start. May
; opened %o to Via lower, at 74 hie, and advanced
I to 75Vic. All the opening strength oozed out
ward the end of the session. May declined to
i 73% c and closed at 74Â®74Hc. Primary Western
I market receipts were only 261.000 bushels, com-
I pared with 433.000 bushels a year ago. Atlan
| tic port clearances of wheat and flour were
equal to 211.000 bushels. Crop reports as a
whole were unfavorable, but In several cases
conflicting, and the market had many changes
i within a moderate range. Liquidation con
; tinued, however, on all the hard spots and
I near the close the market was in a very heavy
I mood. Short selling by Wall-street Interests
i and heavy selling in September from the North
west also had a bearish Influence. July fluctua
tions kept in close touch with May at nic to
IVic premium.
[ Speculative Interest was limited In corn and
a slightly lower range of prices was estab-*
llshed. Rains throughout the corn States and
indications of Increased acreage had a de
pressing Influence. May corn closed %c to %o
. lower.
(tats were weak and lower In sympathy with
I the leading grains. There was an enormous
cash demand, but it was said to be old busi
ness transacted under the reduced export rates
inaugurated yesterday, but withdrawn to-day
on the plea that it was a mistake. May oats
closed 14c to 140 lower.
Provisions were firm and fairly active owing
to higher prices at the yards and hotter de
t jnaod for meats. Part of the advance was lost
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY,
near the close. May pork opened 2%c higher at
$9 15, advanced to $9 20 and closed with buyers
at $9 15. The range In lard and ribs was small.

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS.
The gloomy news from "the Prune crop, men
tioned In The Call of yesterday, is abundantly
' confirmed from a number of sources. Th* drop
Is very severe and takes in the whole State,
Santa Clara, Sonoma, the San Joaquln and all. I
It is generally agreed that the dry weather
last year Is the cause. Many orchards lose all
thÂ«ir Prunes, others a quarter to a half, and so j
on. The irrigated orchards seem to be stand- i
ing the visitation better than the non-irrigated,
thus tending to prove the theory given above.
The trees blossomed so liberally that the whole
State Immediately rushed to the conclusion that
the crop would be immense, but experienced
orchardlsts know by bitter experience that a
tine crop of blossoms does not necessarily mean
a fine crop of fruit. The drop will probably
cease in a few days, when the full extent of
the damage will be known.

of ore. equal to an averags of $1S 43 per ton.
The Boston News Bureau says: "The North
Star Mining Company has been incorporated
under New Jersey laws to take over the busi
ness of the North Star Mining Company of

HE REFUSED TO MARRY HER
LOVE STORY OF THE "DUKE
OF RICHMOND."
lteri of the Ancient Millionaire
Were Opposed to the Love Match
and Dampened His Ardor
Disastrously.

Oakland Offlee San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 20.
Miss Jane HodÃe to-day finally verified
the romantic story uf her lacerated affec
tions and sad disappointment caused by
the sudden termination of her engagement
to the aged capitalist, John Nicholl, the
"Duke of Richmond," as published In The
Call last January, by filing suit in the
Superior Court for the recovery of $50,000
damages fur breach of promise of mar
riage. The complaint was prepared by At
torneys Heed <fc Nusbaumer.
Following is the complaint verbatim:
That on or about the linn Jay of Novem
ber, 189S, at the city of Oakland, county of
Alameda, t-tatt.- or California, in considera
tion that the plaintiff, who was then un- ]
married, would ut the request of the de
fendant marry him <-'" request, the defend
ant promised to marry plaintiff within a
reasonable time.
That the plaintiff, confiding in said prom
ise, has always since remained and con
â¢ tinued and still is sole and unmarried, and
has always remained from said 10th of No
.vrmber. IS9S. :u> to the rreser.t time, ready
and willing to marry the s-.iid defendant,
and she is now ready and willing to marry
the snid defendant.
. That thereafter and on or about the 26th
day of December. IS9S. the plaintiff re
quested the defendant t--> fulfill his said
promise of marriape and make this plaintiff
hls= wife, but the said defendant refused to
fuflU his said promise of marriage and
notified the plaintiff that he would not then
or at any time thereafter fulfill his said
promise of marriage, and the said defend
ant refused and still does refuse to marry
plaintiff. ,' Â
That upon the refusal of defendant to
fulfill his aforesaid promise of marriage,
and by reason thereof the plaintiff suffered
nnd Ftlll suffers much in mind and body,
and her health was thereby and still con
tinues to be BTeatly impaired, and she
suffered and stii! suffers great injury to her
fpeiines nnd affections, and her pride was
thereby and by reason thereof greatly
w.iunded.
That the plaintiff has been damaged by
reason of the premises In the sum of $50.
--000.
Wherefore plaintiff prays Judgment
nealn^t defendant for the sum of $50,000 and
for costs of suit
A simpler complaint in a suit of such
magnitude and bohind which lingers the
love story of \ho anciont millionaire has
seldom reached the file of the Superior
Court. Miss llodpp has passed singly
thrmiph forty-six Bummers and her tardy
millionaire lover, whoso wooinp her with
hurninc kisso? nnd twelve-mile drives has
boon told in The Call heretofore, has
reached the ape of 70 years. Miss Hodge
says that she became enlaced to John
Nicholl on November 10 of last year.
"For more than one year he had bf^n
wanting to put the question," says the
lady who was once the prospective
"Duchess of Richmond," "and I finally
decided t" riv*Â» him nn opportunity. On
November ? John Xirholl called upon me
and ap hÂ«Â» wa? getting into his buggy he
snid, in the presence of Mr. and Mrs.
Berry: 'Jni;t>, I think you need a com
panion. To-morrow we will go driving
and talk it over.'
"I consented, and when we went driving
the following day we had hardly lost Bight
of my home whfn Mr. Nicholl remarked:
Man* 1 , do you know what I am going to
do with you? That is. if you will let me
do it?' I answered, 'What?' and then he
said: 'Marry you. I thought you knew
that for me time. What do you say?'
I replied that I thought I had better
marry him. and he embraced me and said,
â¢God bless us In the union.' "
However, when the news of the engage
ment was broken to the aped lover's
daughtersâ Misses Hester and Maizie
Xloholl â there was Thine doing In
th" millionaire's household at 1353 Fourth
avenue. Maizie. according to Miss Hodge,
instantly grew cold toward her and finally
the daughter told the prospective step
mother that she did not approve of It.
Soon thereafter Miss Hodge received a
note, ostensibly from Mr. Nieholl, an
nouncing that he knew of no engagement
but merely an agreement that if the
daughters \were willing he would marry.
After that Miss Hodge seldom was per
mitted to sf>e him. The daughters kept
Mm secluded In his palatial home.
Mif=s Hodge is a niece of Mr. NicholL
She says she is now very much disap
pointed" in him who had made her think
the world pivoted on her. She had not
meant to tako any action for months to
come-7-possibly neverâ hut the action of
Maizie and Hester, who, she says, had
t-^-nt a lady friend to find out who her
lawyer might be, and who also tried to
effect a reconciliation, has induced her
to gratify the ladies, who, he claims,
destroyed her hopes, by filing the suit.

I would like to have your Judgment on

advice and assistance. Tours respectfully,

S\N FRANCISCO, April 5, 1899.
Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor of San
Francisco, Calâ My I 'car Mayor: I have
before me your valued favor of the Ist
Inat Inclosing resolution No. ]SÂ«i (Fourth
Series) In rr-iation to the exportation of
lepers to Molokal, In the Hawaiian Islands.
In reply thereto would say that I think
the resolution is In the Interest of th>;
bealtb Of our rtty and State, and. as you
Justly say, the support of these lepers t.o
.im unjust burden upon our people.
I am in full accord with your \iÂ«jws on
this subject. It Pcems only rlÃht and
proper that the Federal authorities should
*rrant permission to have patients afflicted
with leprosy transported to the Island In
the Hawaiian (tr-oup especially set apart
for their treatment, and their support
should lie borne by the Government In pen
eral.
It Is needless for me to Bay that it will
afford me great pleasure to co-operate with
you and the Board of Supervisors In your
efforts In this direction. I am Inclined to
the opinion, however, that our Federal au
thorities would at this time answer us by
Baying that they have no authority to
grant this permission, as under the resolu
tion annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the
United States is provided In substance:
That until Congress shall enact laws for
the government of the territory, the Ha
waiian laws now In force and not In con
flict with the treaty of the United States
or with treaties with other countries, or
In conflict with our own laws, shall remain
In full force and effect until the Congress
of the United States shall provide the nec
essary legislation for the government of the
Territory of Hawaii.
The Commissioners appointed by the
President last year visited the islands and
they have formulated a bill for Its ter
ritorial government.
This i ill has been Introduced Into both
branches of Congress and referred to the
committees, but no action has yet been
taken by Congress. Therefore, until this
bill becomes a law, I do not think the ob
ject in view can be attained. But as I
have before stated, as soon as the reso
lution which has been formulated Is final
ly adopted, If you will place In shape a
proper communication, to the President I
shall gladly Join you In the petition prayed
for. I remain, very truly yours.

DOWN 60 THE RATES
ON PULLMAN SLEEPERS
GREAT NORTHERN INAUGUR
ATES A NiiW SCHEDULE.
The Pullman palace car people are ex
periencing tholr first rate war In the West.
Ever since the traveling public became
convinced it could stand its two and a
half per night for an lntermittant snooze
across country Mr. Pullman and his por
ters have had rates and about everything
else all their own way.
Now, however, they have found their
finish, temporarily anyway. The company
has boon compelled to paro down its
through tariffs to Missouri River points
on both berths and drawing rooms, and it
remains to be seen whether the cut will
stop at its present figures. The loosening
of Mr. Pullman's cinch was effected by
Jim Hill, the fighting president of the
Great Northern. Hill has never paid
bounties or royalties or anything else,
Bave the first price, to the Pullmans or
Wagners or other of the palace car manu
facturers. "When he has wanted sleepers
he has bought them outright and paid the
B&laries of his own porters.
A week ago he announced he could find
profit enough in a lesser rate than the
standard that has obtained and cut
prices from one and a half to two dollars
to Missouri River points. Yesterday the
Pullmans announced the same cut. The
cut Is as follows: From Omaha to San
Francisco and Los Angeles, from $13 to
$1150. drawing room from $r>o to $44; from
Chicago to S;m Francisco and Los An

NEALL WAS IN
GOOD HEALTH
IN JANUARY
Examined Then for
His Promotion.
TESTIMONY OF DR. WARE
ACCUSED SEEMED WELL THE
DAY HE DISAPPEARED.
Facts and Figures Are Shown From
the Books of the Troop, the Club
and the Post Ex
change.
There was little else than a column of
figures In the court-martial of Lieutenant
Neall yesterday. They were taken from
the books of the Presidio Club, the books
of the troop to which Neal! was at
tached, from bills and statements from
merchants and from the books of the
post exchange. Receipts, disbursements
and balances filled the day's evidence to
the exclusion of everything else except a
few words about the condition In which
Neall seemed to be In at the tinre he
disappeared from the post.
I. P. Ware, captain and assistant sur- :
geon, was called during the afternoon to ;
tell the result of the examination to j
which Neall submitted at the time he
was before the examining board for pro- j
motion to a captaincy. A physical ex- I
amlnation is an important part of the j
examination for promotion, and Ware j
was one of the surgeons on the medical
board. The examination took place about
the beginning of January. Neall seemed
to be in good health and the surgeons
considered him well fitted to perform the
duties of the rank to which he aspired.
Dr. Ware noticed a slight weakness and
irregularity of Neall' s heart, but he at
tributed it to an attack of grip, from
which he was told Neall was just recov- |
ering. He did not consider the weakness
permanent or serious. He advised Neall
to smoke less, but that was all. Po far
as the certificate signed by Neall ueclar
ing that he was in good health was con- [
eerned Ware said the board seldom con-
Bidered such documents. An examina
tion is made of the applicant for promo
tion whether lie certifies he is in good
health or not. The certificate is presumed
to be merely the statement of the indi
vidual and he is not considered an ex
pert even on himself.
Under cross-examination Ware admit
ted that grip might affect a man in a va
riety of ways and might seriously Inca
pacitate him, but it would be more like
ly to make him inefficient In his clerical
duties than in his military duties.
This piece of information was brought
out by the testimony of First Sergeant
James C. Robertson of Neall'S old troopâ
ii. He was called to tell everything about
the books of the troop and the troop
fund, but after he was through he was
asked about the inspection to which In
spector General Field subjected the troop
and of the maneuvers which they were
ordered to go through as a part of the
inspection. Neall was in command dur
ing the man. uvers and the sergeant tes
tified that there was nothing wrong with
the way he handled the troop; there were
no wrong orders given and the maneu
vers went off without hitch or mistake.
He thought at the time that Lleuti
Neall was well able to handle the troop
and that he knew his business. He had
noticed that Neall had had a bad cough
for some time before, but he knew the
lieutenant was not on the sick list. The
Inspection was held on the morning of
February lf>, the date of the disappear
ance of Lieutenant Npall. The desire of
the prosecution to show that on the morn
ing of that day he was apparently in ex
cellent health is evident.
Referring to the books, the sergeant
said the Inspector had found everything
in good shape except the truop fund book.
The inspector had not inspected the troop
fund book, but if he had done so he would
have found it sadly lacking in many items
that should have appeared upon Its pages.
The, troop fund book, the witness said.
was kept by the commanding officer of
the troop.
Lieutenant McNalr, quartermaster of
the Third Artillery, and one of the mem
bers of the court, was culled to testify to
the condition of the books of the Presidio
Club, of which organisation he is secre
tary and treasurer. ]!â¢â  succeeded Neall
in those offices. The Investigating com
mittee had reported to him that the club
was about $1000 in debt, and he wrote
to the various creditors for statements of
their accounts. He had settled all the
outstanding bills. He said the creditors
disclaimed all intention to dun the club,
but they submitted their bills as a memo
randum of account to be paid at conveni
ence. The books, the witness said, seem
ed not to have been kept up from May
of 1898.
McNalr was questioned closely by Mr.
Thornton as to the financial standing of
the club, the obiect being to show that
when most of the officers have been or
dered away the club is not self-sustaining
and under the circumstances the treas
urer has to wait until the receipts in
crease by the arrival of more officers be
fore he can pay all outstanding bills, but
this line of inquiry was not followed far,
as it will be made a matter of defense and
not of cross-examination.
The other witness of the day was Pri
vate Arthur M. Graham. Troop ]?, clerk
of the post exchange. His testimony re
lated to the receipts of the post exchange
and how they had been receipted for every
day by Lieutenant Neall. He. too, was
asked about Neall's health during Janu
ary and February of this year, but he
said he had noticed nothing serious the
matter with his officer.
More Trouble in Chinatown.
A number of Chinese highbinders loft
this city yesterday for Fresno to take
part in the war now on in that place be
tween the Hop Sings and the Suey Dins.
The Chinese in this city aver that the
trouble grew out of the convict inn of Tal
Choy for the murder of Chuck Hock in
this city about six months ago. The high
binders* were afraid of Lieutenant Price,
so they fought their battle in Fresno. The
war is not yet over by any moans, but it
is expected that the battleground win ho
changed from Fresno to San Francisco
before the end of the week owing to the
change, of squad men in Chinatown. The
new sqund Is not yet broken in to the
harness and the highbinders; think they
can operate more frec-ly than heretofore.
Cruelty to Animals.
Felix Gross, a coal dealer on Ninth
street, was yesterday convicted by Judge
Conlan on a char-e of cruelty to his
horses and was ordered into custody to
appear for sentence this morning on $300
bonds. The fuse against John Crowlcy,
one of Gross' drivers, was continued till
to-day. Gross wanted to conduct Crow
ley's defense, but was promptly stopped
by the Judge on the complaint of Secre
tary Holbronk. Then Gross got an at
torney's clerk to undertake the defense,
but he was also called down by the Judge.
Had Drunk to Excess.
W. H. Marston, a well-known insurance
man, was picked up at the corner of First
and Mission streets last evening by the
police and taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal, where he was treated for the effects
of excessive drinking. While the attend
ant at the hospital was out of the room
Marston Jumped through a window, and,
gaining the street, ran two blocks before
the officers could recapture him. He was
returned to the hospital and placed under
restraint.
Attorney Pistolesi Fined.
When Attorney Louis C. Pistolesl ap
peared before acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday for sentence on the charge of
disturbing the peace of Bacon place the
Judge said he would impose a fine of $5.
Pistolesi suggested, "no alternative," but
the Judge retorted that he was quite able
to pay the fine. Pistolesl gave notice of
appeal.
TWO TRANSPORTS
ARE TRAVELING
TOWARD TROUBLE
Warren and Newport
Sail for Manila.
SOLDIERS AND MARINES SAIL
BANDS PLAYED "THE STAR
SPANGLED BANNER."
It Will Be a Race to Honolulu Be
tween the Transports to Secure
the Only Available
\ Berth.
Two transports sailed for Manila yes
terday afternoon. The non-arrival of a
contingent of the men who were to go on
the Warren delayed that vessel since last
Tuesday, and in consequence she did not
got away until half an hour after the
Newport. Both vessels will call at Hon
olulu, and as there is only one availabe
dock, the first one in will get it. The bet
ting on the front is that the Newport will
be in port and tied up alongside the wharf
before the Warren arrives.
The Warren took away 240 recruits and i
912 men, comprising eight batteries of the \
Sixth Artillery, 22 bandsmen, 6 members â 
of the Hospital Corps and 2 members of
the N. C. staff. General E. B. Williston j
was in command, and with him !
were Major S. A. Cloman, commissary;
Major Bose, in command of the troops;
2G company officers and 4 surgeons.
The transport was to have sailed at 3 I
p. m., but the men who had been given j
shore leave could not be found, and the j
warning whistle from the steamer was
not sufficient to bring them out of the j
saloons in which they were having "just
one more before you go." A corporal's |
guard was se.nt out and several free \
fights were imminent before the men .
were driven out of the drinking-places j
and aboard the transports. Finally all j
who could be found were secured and
then the gangway was hauled in. A num
ber of stragglers then showed up and they |
were got aboard over the side with the |
assistance of a rope.
Second Boatswain Charles Barmann got
a good ducking just before the Warren
sailed. He went to throw a lot of rubbish
overboard, but kept such a tight hold on j
the stuff that he went over himself. Joe
Keating, Henry Peterson's factotum, hap
pened to be alongside the transport in a
Whitehall and he at once went to the
boatswain's assistance and got him into
the boat. Barmanii was put on the wharf
and got back aboard the transport noth
ing the worse for his wetting.
There were a number of changes among
the crew of the Warren. Chief Steward
Mussel has been appointed port steward
of the transport fleet and he remains
ashore. Chief Steward Howard went out
in his place. First Assistant Engineer
William E. Mears did not depart. His
place was taken by F. James, and D.
Hillman went out as second assistant, and
A. B. Gibson (Junior engineer) as third
assistant.
There was no delay in getting the New
port away. At 2:.% p. m. the last of the
soldiers marched down to the transport -
and were put aboard. Promptly at 3p. m. ;
the vessel pulled out into the stream ami i
was well out on her way to sea before the â 
Warren's lines were cast off. Strange to
say, \Â»ry few vessels saluted the New
port, while almost every whistle on the
front w;is blown as the Warren steamed
past. It was not generally known that
the Newport was to sail, and people took
her for one of the Mail Company's fleet
bound for Central America.
Those who went out on the Newport
were: Colonel Pope, commanding the
marines, and Major Tiernan, commanding
the artillery; Mr. and Mrs. I'msted and
son for Honolulu; Messrs. Hargls, Neth
ercote and Peyton, clerks for the Govern
ment service in Manila; and the following
nurses: Mrs. Switzenberg, Misses Anna
M. Seagran, Marie A. Kolp. Rose Tweed
Mrs. Dr. Palm, Misses C. L. Howard,
Margaret Bertram, Wlllha Dockrill S.
Hayden, M. A. Burrill. Mary Hambley,
Mrs. A. Newman (sister of Senator
Thurston of Xebraskai and Miss Hartley
(an artist). Mrs. Newman is to write a
book i>n the* Philippines and Miss Hartley
Will illustrate it.
Besides theso there were 260 marines,
officered by Captains Davis, Fuller, Long
and Haynes and l^leutenants Thorp, But
ler, Leonard, Gillson, Hill, Reid and Dun
lop. Major McAuley and Major Spicer
and Dr. Waggener also mustered with
the marines.
Two batteries of artillery, composed of
220. men and the following officers, also
â went out: Captain Taylor, Fourth Artil
lery: Lieutenants Bowley, Miller and Kll
breth; Captain Rellly, Fifth Artillery;
lieutenants Summerall and McCloskey.
and Dr. Coffin and Lieutenant Burgess,
commissary and quartermaster.
Of the other transports now in port the
Morgan City will probably get away next
.Monday. Her engines have been over
hauled and that has delayed her some
what. The Ohio go.s on the drydock at
Hunters Point to-day, and she will be
back at Folsom street to-morrow and
will begin loading Monday. The Senator
is now taking in her cargo and will he
ready to pail as soon as the troops as
signed to her arrive. The Grant is now
hourly expected from Manila and she will
be rushed back again as quickly as pos
sible. When she goes she will carry two
full regiments.

The evil of "hand booking" has be-

This gambler's name is Fred Jackson.
He is a type of the men who are violat

money from a source which he is care
ful to conceal. He haunts the saloons
on Market and Ellis streets up to Pow
ell. He accosts his patrons wherever
he meets them, and. under the very eyes
of the polite, conducts his illegal busi
ness. Yesterday afternoon he motioned
a patron into a doorway at Stockton
and Market streets. The thoroughfares
were thronged with pedestrians. The
police themselves had created a dis
turbance at the corner in an effort to
arrest and subdue a belligerent pris
oner. Jackson drew his customer into
a doorway, announced the result of a
race that had just ended at Emery
ville and accepted another wager. The
police were too busy with their pris
oner to notice the incident, which was
pimply one of many that is agitating
the decent people of the city and
prompting them to demand from the
police authorities the c-nforcement of
the law.
CYCLE DEALERS ELECT â¢
THEIR NEW OFFICERS
WALTER B. MORRrLL PRESI
DENT OF THE ASSOCIATION.
Reports Show the Organization to Be j
in a Most Prosperous
Condition.
The fourth annual meeting of the San
Francisco Cycle Board of Trade was hold '
last night In the assembly room of the j
Parrott building. The association has
been a marked succesn since its organiza
tion, bringing the dealers, both wholesale
and retail, and the repair mf-n, together
under one strong protective organization.
This was th<^ llrst of its kind In Amer
ica, but similar bodies are now to be j
found at nil cycling centers. San Jose
si iid Los Angeles have well organized I
boards, while Brittle dealers have re
cently formed one.
The principal business transacted last
night was the election of officers for the
enÃUlng year. "Walter B. Morrill was cho
m 11 president, W. J. Kenney vice presi
dent, C. F. Marwedel treasurer and
James If. Hamilton secretary.
Reports from various officers and com
mittees showed the organization to be in
splendid condition, although the dealers j
have had several bad years. The pres
ent season has opened auspiciously and I
gives promise of being a banner year for
the trade. The annual banquet of the
association will be held shortly. A com
mittee, consisting of C. F. Marwedel, Ed
win Mohrlg and James M. Hamilton, was
appointed to arrange the details of the
affair.
Several new members were elected, and
those without the fold were expected to
join shortly.

as .to what rate they will bo compelle 1 to
pay for their light during the coming
year. Mayor Pholan contends the rate
has been fixed irrevocably at $1 10 per
thousand {Vet. The gas company volun
tarily agrees to reduce its rates from
Jl 75 to $1 60 per thousand feet. The
members of the Hoard of Supervisors are
not certain what they want, what they
have donÂ© or what they are expected to
do.
This, in brief, is the unsettled condi
tion in which yesterday's meeting of the
board, called for the purpose of consld-
! ering the question of gas rates, has left
i the much-discussed question. As a result
'â  another day is to be devoted to the con
sideration of the matter, there being an
intimation that the Inquiry will lead to
a thorough Investigation of the books of
| the gas companies to the end that the
I members of the l>uard may gain :n
knowledge of just how much it costs the
â  corporation to make and deliver gas to
consumers. This will not be done if the
| friends of the corporations in the board
â  can prevent it. but It is at least a p
i blllty that lends anticipatory zest to to
day's meeting.
That the representatives of the gas
companies scent danger ahead Is made
apparent by their act in appearing be
fore the. board yesterday and making a
I voluntary offer to surrender $135,000 a year
j in order that the dear people may have
the benefit of a $1 GO pas rate. They had
j decided to do this, they said, to "pre
i vent trouble" and make things pleasant
j all around.
President Crockett of the San Francisco
Gas and Electric. Company wan the per
son to whom had been delegated the
honor of making kn Â»wn this voluntary
offering to peace, good will and th.- wel
j fare of the gas-consuming populace
"I wish to state at the beginning," he
: said. that without disrespect to this
board the gas company has always and
| does now contend that the board has no
j power or authority to jix gas rates
While we believe this to be true we are'
I nevertheless, willing to do everything hi
our power to avoid trouble and litigation
For this reason the bonrd of directors of
the Ran Francisco (las and Electric Com
pany held a meeting yesterday and agreed
tn voluntarily reduce existing rates

CALIFORNIA LAYS CLAIM
TO ANOTHER HERO OF WAR
Private Gavin, With a Com
panion, Fires the Ene
my's Stronghold.
DEEDS of valor, performed by
California boys, who sacrificed
home and friends for a patriotic
life under the blistering tropical
sun, are being repeated in every nook
find corner of the islands. The last
Californlan to distinguish himself was
Private Martin Gavin of Troop C,
who, in company with Private Mur
ray of the Fame troop, advanced in
the face of what seemed certain death
and fired a hut crowded with Fili
pino sharpshooters, who had been an
noying the American lines for several
hours.
Gavin, previous to the war. was em- '
ployed in the mechanical department of The Call. Hp was among the first
to volunteer his services to the Government and sailed for the Philippines
In the early stage of the trouble, lie has been in the thickest of many of
the prominent battles which have occurred, and is always mentioned by his
comrades as one of the moat fearless of the troop. On March 4 orders were
given to the cavalry squadron to support the Fourteenth Infantry near Pa
say. Troop E marched to blockhouse 13 and remained under a heavy fire for
six hours. Troops C and L lay to their support about 100 yards in the rear
of the firing line until given orders by Captain Birkhimer to charge on tho
natives. One position held by the Filipinos was decidedly in the latter's fa
vor. It was a blockhouse into which many Filipino sharpshooters had
crowded, and from which they gave the Americans much annoyance Ga
vin and Murray volunteered to root out the natives. Their attempt was re
garded as certain death, as they would be alone in the open and entirely at
the mercy of a constant fusillade. The brave boys, without hesitation
rushed beyond the firing lines In the direction of the hut and were Imme
diately made targets for the natives. They, however, succeeded in reaching
the fortification and applying a torch drove the occupants from. their shel
ter, enabling our troops to gain much ground.
rate $1 60 instead of $1 75. This will de
crease our revenue about $135,000 annually.
This reduction is about as much as we
can possibly stand, and this we are will
ing to make voluntarily in the interest
of harmony."
A representative of the Gas Improve
ment Company said the rate of $1 60 was
satisfactory to his company, notwith
standing the fact that it reduced the rev
enue of the company about $40,000 a year.
., 1 \ Vl '? s at this point in the proceedings
that the Mayor sprung a sensation in the
form of the following communication:
April 20, 1899.
To the Honorable the Board of Supervis
or of the City ami County of San Fran
ciscoâGentlemen: Pursuant to an "Act to
regulate the quality and standard illumi
nating power and the price of gas in all
cities within the State of California having
a population of one hundred thousand or
more." approved March 4. 1878, the Board
of Supervisors of the city and county of
J~ an Iranciscn, after an investigation and
hearing reports required by law, on April 3,
1599. by resolution No. 2621 (fourth series)
fixed the candle power of gas to be supplied
by gas light companies at seventeen (IT)
candles an.l the maximum rate to be charged
and collected from consumers at $1 10 per
thousand cubic feet. No notice of recon
sideration was given and the resolution
Ftood of record until the next following
r-gular meeting of the Board of Supervis
ors, namely, on April 10. ISS9. when an at
tempt was made to rescind it. But in this
case it appears from the law that the
board had no power to rescind, and I
claim that their action stands fixing the
illuminating power at seventeen (17) candles
and the price of gas at Jl 10. I base this
opinion upon section 3 of the legislative act
Of 1878, above referred to, which, in part,
reads as follows: "When the standard and
price are once fixed such standard and
price may he changed by said board from
time to time not oftener than once every
year, as Increased consumption or other
circumstances may in their judgment ro-
Quire." Therefore the rate should hold
for one year, as thr> rate was fixed under
the authority of this act, all the preliminar
ies having been complied with.
City and County Attorney H. T, Creswell.
in an opinion Riven to the Heard of Super-
Visors August 23, lÂ«r<3. says: "The consti
tution provides that all laws In force at
thr a loption of the constitution not incon
sistent therewith shall remain in force and
effect until repealed by the Legislature. The
net of InTS )i;ik not, as far as I have been
able to discover, been altered or repealed
and It Is not Inconsistent with the consti
tution of 1N79, adopted after the passage of
the act." }
The attorneys of the gas companies con
tend, as you are aware, that the Supervis
ors have no power to regulate rates; but.
granting that they have, they still contend
that a $1 10 rate will not yield a sufficient
revenue to pay them on their capital stock.
Tho Supreme Court has held, however,
that it is n.n capital stork but the value
of the companies' properties employed in
serving the public with such commodities
as artificial light is the true basis on
which tn fix compensating rates.
The question th*n is. first, what is the
value of the companies' property so em
ployed, and second, what does it cost the
companies to furnish light in the burner
and to collect their bills. All in excess of
that cost is profit. The president of the
San Francisco (las and Electric I'ompany
testified that this cost was about $1 per
thousand cubic feet, but independent testi
mony would lead us to believe that It la
not more than SO cents. If his company
Ff-rves yearly 900,000.000 cubic feet, which
is the approximate amount. 10 cents- profit
per thousand would yield jsn.nno and SO
cents per thousand $270,000. Estimating the
true value of the gas plant at $5,000,000 the
president's figures would yield less than
2 per cent per annum on that amount, but
the independent figures would show an ap
paren! yield of BH per cent.
I lay these facts and a statement of the
law before the board for its guidance. Re
spectfully, JAMES D. PHEL.AN, Mayor.
The reading of this communication
brought Thomas B. Bishop, attorney for
the gas company, to his feet. He de
clared that the act of I^7B, to which the
Mayor had referred, was, in his opinion.
unconstitutional, and he had so advised
his clients.
"Neither the city nor the gas com
pany," he said, "wants to he involved in
litigation if it can be avoided. The gas
company is not a public enemy. Its serv
ic< s to "the public are valuable. It fur
nishes a commodity that is a necessity to
the needs of modern civilization. We
want to do the decent tiling and we will
do it if you will meet us half way. We
have rights as well as the public, and our
rights are entitled t<> as much considera
tion at your hands as the rights of prl
vate Individuals. We contend that you
have no right n<>r power to fix pas rates,
and we arc willing to submit the merit of
< ii i r enntention to the courts. At the same
time we do n*'t wish to adopt such a
course if wo can avoid it by reasonable
concessions. These concessions wo have
made, and all we nsk is that we be ac
corded fair treatment."
Supervisor Hylngton said he believed
the board should accept former City and
County Attorney Creswell's Interpretation
of the law a.s orrect and act accordingly.
He believed with the Mayor that the rate
to be paid for pas had been fixed at $1 10
and could not be changed.
Supervisor Aigeltinger wanted to know
If the gas company would not consent to
a rate of $1 50 for gas. To this President
Crockett replied that his company had
considered the matter very carefully and
had decided that $1 fH) was as low as they
could go.
Supervisors wanted to close the ma.tter
and moved that the board adjourn until
Monday. This did not suit Perrault, who
declared that the matter had been taken
out of the hands of the Finance Commlt
tee as a bluff and he wanted to see the
Muff called. He wanted to know what the
meeting- was called for If not for the pur
pose of. investigating the question of gas
rates.
Supervisor T>easy thought further ac
tion should be postponed until some means
could be adopted to ascertain the merit-*
of Mayor I'helan's contention. Tf the rate
had been irrevocably fixed, he Faid, at
?1 10, then it was worse than folly to con
sider the matter further. To this Super
visor Perrault added "the surrerestion that
the gas company be required to produce
its books and papers to show the cost of
the production and delivery of gas.
As a sort of compromise it was finally
decided that the board meet again at 10
o'clock this morning for the avowed pur
pose of conducting an investigation. What
the scope or purpose of suon investigation
will b^ is left to the imagination, as there
was no plan outlined or suggested by the
members present.
Probably a Poisoning.
Bonifaoius Hirt, a veteran of the> <~*ivil
War, 63 years old and a printer by occu
pation, died of pneumonia at the City and
County Hospital lust Wednesday evening,
and an autopsy on the body at the hos
pital by I>r. Tillman disclosed the fact
that there was a puncture in the gullet of
the dead man as though made by a cor
rosive poison. The body was removed to
the Morgue, and the contents of the
stomach will he subjected to a chemical
analysis.

TORE DOWN THE HOUSE.
J. Rittigstein Was Imposed Upon but
Nevertheless Met Defeat.
Negotiations opened some time ago be
tween J. Rittigstein and L. Snido, two
prosperous business men of Third street,
and finally the former agreed to c
the premises at 115 Third street from the
latter, in order to prevent close competi
tion in the immediate district. When Rit
tigstein finally agreed with Snide that it
was for the best interests of both to
make the change, he moved his stock
from 253 Fourth street into the new quar
ters and began business. Snfde ran a
pawnbroking shop at 113 Third street,
and for a few weeks both prospered.
Finally RittiKstein was notified by the
owner of the premises that he must va
cate. ,
He made inquiries as to why he should
move, but not long ago he found out
without further difficulty. A force of
workmen arrived at the premises and be
gan tearing down the building he occu
pied, and he vacated without further
ceremony. Then he concluded thai he
had been "jobbed" by Snide and he filed
suit to recover SiOO damages, the amount
he says he lost through his removal. Yes
terday the case was called by Judge
Hunt, a jury was impaneled, Rittiff:=tein
told his story and then the defendant
moved for a nonsuit. Jt was granted and
Rittigstein left the court, it is thought to
search for new quarters.

BRISK BIDDING
FOR SUTRO'S
CLIFF HOUSE
The Famous Seaside
Resort to Be Sold.
PABST AFTER THE PROPERTY
C. E. LOOSE OF SALT LAKE
COMES HERE TO COMPETE.
The Executors of the Estate Have Be
ceived Many Handsome Offers
From Various Sections of
the Country.
It is probable that the Cliff House will
soon cease to be a portion of the estate
of the late Adolph Sutro. The executors
of the dead millionaire's estate have been
ordered to dispose of his famous seaside
possessions, and already local and East
ern capitalists are competing for the re
sort that caters to the fancy and palates
of people from all over the civilized world.
The' Cliff House is perhaps the best
marketable section of the late Adolph
Sutro's vast estate, and when it became
known that the property was to be sold
many handsome offers were received from
local and outside capitalists.
A short time apn tVin executors of tha
Sutro estate announced privately that the
resort was for sale, and the representa
tives of the Fabst Brewing Company in
this city, seeing a golden opportunity for
their firm to acquire a valuable and
profitable resort, wired to Milwaukee, and
within a few weeks a special representa
tive of the company hurried here ;o put
in a bid for the property.
C. E. Loose, a wealthy hanker and mine
owner of Salt Lake City, who has had his
on the property for some time past,
arrived in this city about a week ago,
ired to pay a top figure for the sea-
Blde resort Mr. Loose spent several days
ting the place, and then he sat
down and wrote out a bid for it. The
Salt Lake financier knew there were other
wealthy men who were anxious to acquire
the famous resort, and he confided to a
friend that he intended to make the ex
ecutors of Adolph Kutro's estate a hand
some offer for it. Mr. Loose presented the
executors of the estate with his bid a
day or so ago and then left the city and
returned to his home in Salt Lake. There
are several other wealthy men bidding for
the property, hut those who have an ink
ling into the inside of the deal say that
the sharp contest f<>r possession of the
resort is between ( '. TC. Loose and the
Pabst Brewing Company.
Those in charge of the estate are ex
tremely reticent about discussing any
feature of the proposed sale or giving any
Information concerning the number of
bids received or the amount of money
nffi red for the < 'lift" 1 ;
The* l';ibst Brewing Company's bid is
said to be in the neighborhood of Hi
It is not known how much Hanker Loose
offered. It Is expected that th~ sale will
be effected within h few weeks, li is the
