LETTER OF POPE LEO
TO THE AMERICANS
HIS HOLINESS POPE LEO XIII.
BALTIMORE, if|^23. The following is an ap
proved translation^ the letter of Pope Leo XIII to
Cardinal Gibbons on Americanism, the Latin origi
nal having been received recently by Cardinal Gib
bons, to whom it was forwarded by Cardinal Ram
polla, the Papal Secretary of State:
To our beloved son, James, Cardinal Gibbons, Cardinal priest of the
Title Sancta Maria, Beyond the Tiber, Archbishop of Baltimore;
LEO XIII, Pope.
BELOVED son. health and apos
tolic blessing: We send to you
by this letter a renewed ex
pression of that good will
which we have not failed during the
?"urpe of our pontificate to manifest
frequently to you and t<> your coU
leagues in the episcopate and to the
vvhole American people, availing nur
every opportunity offered by

you have done f<>r safeguarding

which enable the American people to

Although thi.s letter be not intended,
as pre< eding ones, to repeat the words
it praise so often spoken, but rather to
";all attention to some things to be^
ivoidfl and corrected; still because it
is conceived in that same spirit of
ipostolic charity which has inspired all
jur 1' Were, we shall expect that you
will take it ms another proof of our
ove, the more .so because it is intended
Lo suppress certain contentions which
â¢have arisen lately among you to the
â  detriment of the peace* of many souls.
â¢ â¢ It is known to you, beloved son, that
"The Life of Isaac Thomas Hecker,' 7
Especially as interpreted and translated
in a foreign language, has excited not
-j. little controversy, because therein
have been voiced certain opinions coh
â  cerni-ng the way of leading Christian
-\ife.
â¢ We, therefore, on account of on;
apostolic office, having to guard the in
tegrity of the faith and the security of
the faithful, are desirous of writing to
you- more at length concerning this
. whole matter.
. The underlying principle of these new
opinions is that in order to more easily
attract thi>s>- who differ from her, the
â¢ >hureh should shape her teachings more
in ''accord with the spirit of the age and
'â Â£lax some of her ancient severity and
oiake some concessions to new opinions.
Many think that these concessions
should be made not only in regard to
u-avs of living, but even in regard to
doctrines which belong to the deposit
of the faith. They contend that it
v-ould be opportune, In order to gain
those who differ from us, to omit cer
tain points of her teachings which are
â¢V lesser importance -and to tone down
the meaning which the church has al
ways attached to them.
It does not need many words, beloved
, on ' to prove the falsity of these ideas
if the nature and origin of the doctrine
which the church proposes are recalled
to mind The Vatican council says
soncerning this point: "For the doctrine
of faith which God has revealed, has
not been proposed, like a philosophical
invention, to be perfected by human in
t renuity, but has been delivered as a
livine deposit to the spouse of Christ
to be" faithfully kept and infallibly de
flared. Hence, that meaning of the
ga -H'dogmab is perpetually to be re- J

tamed which our holy mother, the
church, has once declared, nor is that
meaning ever to be departed from un
der the pretense or pretext i>f a deeper
comprehension of them." (Constituto
de Fide Catholica, chapter iv.)
We cannot consider as altogether
blameless the silence which purposely
;eads to the omission or neglect of some
of the principles of Christian doctrine,
for all the principles come from the
same author and master, "the Only
Begotten Son, who is in the bosom of
the father."â John i : 18.
That they are adapted to all times
and all nations i.^ clearly seen from
the words of our Lord to his Apostles:
"Go, therefore, teach all nations; teach
ing them to observe all things whatso
ever I have commanded you, and be
hold, I am with you always, even to
the end of the world." â Matthew
xxvii:l9.
Concerning this point, tiie Vatican
Council says: "All those things are to
be believed with divine and catholic
faith which are contained in the word
of ' !od, written or handed down, and
which the church, either by a solemn
judgment or by her ordinary and uni
versal magisterium proposes for belief,
as having been divinely revealed."
(Const, de Fide, chapter iii.) Let it be
far from any one's mind to suppress for
any reason any doctrine that has been
handed down. Such a policy would
tend rather to separate Catholics from
the church than to bring in those who
Jitter. There is nothing closer to our
heart than to have those who are sepa
rated from the fold of Christ return to
it, but in no other way than that point
ed out by Christ.
The rule of life laid down for Catho
lics is not cif such a nature that it cannot
mraodate Itself to the exigencies of
various times and -places. The church
has, guided by her Divine Master, a kind
and merciful spirit, for which reason from
the very beginning she has been what St.
Paul said of himself: "I became all things
to all men that I might save all."
History proves that the Apostolic See, to
which has h.en intrusted the mission not
only of teaching but of governing the
whole church, has continued "in one and
the same doctrine, one and the same
sense and one and the same judgment."
[Const, de Fide, chapter IV.]
But in regard to ways of living she has
been accustomed to so yield that the di
vine principle of morals being kept intact,
she has never neglected to accommo
date herself to the character and genius
of the. nations which she embraces.
Who can doubt that she will act in this
same spirit ag>ain if the salvation of souls
requires it? In this matter the church
must be the judge, not private men, who
are often deceived by the appearance of
right. In this, all who wish to escape the
blame of our predecessor, Pius VI. must
concur. He condemned Â«is injurious to the
church and to the spirit of God who
guided her, the doctrine contained in the
position LXXVIII of the synod of Pistoi.
"That the discipline made and approved
by the church should be submitted to ex
amination," as if the church could frame
a code of laws useless or heavier than
human liberty can bear.
But, beloved son. in this present matter
of which we are speaking, there is even
a greater danger, and a more manifest
opposition to Catholic doctrine and dis
cipline in that opinion of Ihe lovers of
novelty, according to which they hold
such liberty should be allowed in the
church that her supervision and watch

luwance granted the faithful, each one to

follow out more freely the leading of his
own mind and the trend of his own
proper activity. They are of the opinion
that such liberty has its counterpart In
the newly given civil freedom which is
now the right and the foundation of al
most every secular state.
In the apostolic letters concerning the
constitution of states addressed by us v
the bishops of the whole church we dis
cussed this point at length and there se;
forth the difference existing between the
church) which is a divine society, and
all other social human organizations
which depend simply on the free will and
choice of men.
Jt is well, then, to pay direct attention
to the opinion which serves as the argu
ment in behalf of this greater liberty
sought for and recommended to Catho
lic.-.
It is alleged now that the Vatican can
concerning the infallible teaching
authority of tht Roman Pontiff having
bi en proclaimed that nothing further on
that score can give any solicitude, and.
accordingly, since that has been safe
guarded |nd put beyond question, a wider
and freer field, botfi for thought and ac
tion, lies open to each one. But such rea
soning is evidently faulty, since, if we
are to come to any conclusion from the
Infallible teaching of, the church II
should rather be that no one should wish
to depart from it, and, moreover that th<
minds of all bring leavened and direct
ed thereby, greater security from private
error would be enjoyed by all. And fur
ther, those who avail themselves of such
a way of reasoning seem- to depart seri
ously from the overruling wisdom of the
Ifosi High, which, wisdom, since it was
pleased to set forth by solemn decision
the authority and supreme teaching rights
of thi.s Apdstolic See, willed that decision
precisely in order to safeguard the minds
of the church's children from the dan
gers of these present times.
These dangers, viz.: The confounding ot
license with liberty, the passion for dis
cussing and pouring contempt upon any
possible subject, the. assumed right to
tjpld whatever opinions one pleases upor
any subject and to set them forth in print
to the world, have so wrapped minds in
darkness that there Is now a greater need
at the church's teaching office than eveT
before, lest people become unmindful botr,
'if conscience and duty.
We, Indeed, 'have no thought of reject
ing everything that modern industry and
study has produced; so far from it that
we welcome to the patrimony of truth
and to an ever-widening scope of public
well-being which also ever helps toward
the progress of learning and virtue. Yet
all this, to be of any solid benefit, nay
to have a real existence and growth, caY
only be on the condition of recognizing
the wisdom and authority of the church.
Coming now to speak of the conclusions
which have been deduced from the above
opinions, anil for them, we readily be-
Ueve there was no thought of wrong or
guile, yet the things themselves certain
ly merit some degree of suspicion. First,
ail external guidance is set aside for
those souls who are striving after Chris
tian perfection as being superfluous, or,
indeed, not useful in any senseâ the con
tention being that the holy spirit pours
richer and more abundant graces than
formerly upon the souls of the faithful,
so that without human intervention He
teaches and guides them by some hidden
instinct of his own. Yet it is the sign of
no small overconfidence to desire to meas
ure and determine the mode of the divine
communication to mankind, since it whol
ly depends upon his own good pleasure,
and he Is a most generous dispenser of
his own gifts.

MANILA, Feb. 23.â This af
ternoon one of the fiercest
fights for a small one since the
war began took place at and
around Tondo bridge. A body
of daring insurgents, about 250
in number, passed General Mac-
Arthur's left wing along the
swampy shore near Caloocan
during the night and entered the
Tondo district, where there arÂ« j
three miles of nipa huts. Build
ing five trenches across the road,
they took possession of Tondo
bridge, which they held until 2
o'clock.
Thus they were in the outskirts
of the city, and our line of
communication with the front
was cut. Two Minnesota com-
panics sustained the first at
tack, but held on until re
inforced. Captain N. C. Robin
son was wounded in the mouth.
Sergeant George Shepherd, Priv
ates George Wooding and
Thomas Galvin and four others
were also slightly wounded.
At noon to-day one battalion
A the Twenty-third Infantry un
ler Major Goodale, three com

md on each side of the road, and
he insurgents fought from house

.vere killed in one yard. The
American advance was somewhat
slow.
At Tondo bridge the insur
gents made a stubborn fight.
They were on our right and in
trenched in strong positions in
the ditches. Company Cof the
Twenty-third Infantry moved
out to dislodge them, and a hot
battle followed. The insurgents
only showed their heads from
time to time and poured volleys
into our lines. We here lost one
man killed and one wounded.
The fighting of the Twenty
third men at this point was mag
nificent. The nipa huts used as
a refuge by the insurgents had to
be burned and hundreds of refu
gees came into our lines, many
insurgent soldiers among them,
mixed up with weeping women
carrying children. It was diffi
cult to distinguish the insurgents,
who threw away their uniforms
before they were captured.

Finally the insurgent forces
were gradually driven toward the
shore, where the Monadnock.
under the direction of the signal
corps on land, directed an effec
tive fire upon them.
I counted twenty insurgent
dead and many wounded while
simply passing along the line of
advance to the right.
Our loss is undetermined, but
is believed to be relatively light. It
ivas necessary to burn th^ huts for sev
eral miles and the heat of the fire was
terrifir. A cartload of arms was cap
tured.
At 6 o'clock this morning the insur
gents in front of Mac Arthur's division
;it Caloocan fired one gun six times.
This is the most extensive use of artil
lery that the rebellious Filipinos have
made so far in their uprising against
the Americans. Under cover of this
tire they made an advance upon Mac-
Arthur's line, hut were driven off with
out any difficulty whatever.
Further along on our right Aguin
nldo's men succeeded in pressing the
American lines closer. Colonel Frost
then took our four companies of the
South Dakotans and made a . flank
movement, which resulted in driving
them back. Frost's loss was two men
wounded.
In this manner the insurgents are
''cling our lines at all points, doubtless
w"h the purpose of discovering some
weak spot.
At the hour this dispatch is sent
there is sharp fighting going on near
Caloocan. Our loss there so far is one
dead and five wounded. ,
The situation in the city is becoming
serious. I had a very narrow escape
near the Binondo Church, where I was
tired upon, supposedly by rebels. Three
shots splashed upon the pavement
very close to me. Troops were ordered
nut and the street was immediately
i leared.
An American lady passing through
the streets in a carriage also had a
very narrow escape.
The anniversary of Washington's
birthday was an eventful day here.
The fire at Santa Cruz, in the heart of
the city, began at 8 o'clock last even
ing at two different points. General
Hughes appeared promptly on the
scene and it was his energetic measures
without doubt that stopped a general
uprising. Companies of troops, with
the American and English residents,
were immediately detailed as fire
brigades and succeeded in preventing
the spread of the flames to the Escolta,
in the principal business quarter. The
guards were everywhere doubled and
patrolled the streets, preventing an up
rising. One native was killed while in
the act of cutting the fire hose. Three
hundred houses were burned in this
listrict of the city, chiefly occupied by
natives and Chinese. j
While these events were in progress
there fires were simultaneously started
in Tondo and Binondo districts of the
city, and more than one thousand
houses were burned.
General Hale to-day discovered a
body of 400 insurgents lying between
his lines at the pumping station and
the Pasig River. He immediately de
termined to bottle them ap and ordered
out the Wyoming troops, stretching
them over one flank as far as the Pasig
River, where they pivoted. At 3 o'clock
In the morning the Nebraska infantry,
with two of the Utah battery's guns,
were thrown over to the other side to
drive the rebels into the Wyoming
lines. In pursuance of this maneuver
the Nebraska boys beat up a very
rough country for two miles when they
were suddenly taken in the rear by a
body of insurgents advancing to the re
inforcement of their fellows.
Colonel Stotenburg was obliged to
face his troops about and drive back
the enemy. The Filipinos fell back, but

BOLD ATTEMPT
MADE TO BRIBE
C. G. RAUB
State Office or Its Equivalent
in Cash Offered for a
Vote for D. M.
Burns.
Agents of the Mexican Fighting in the
Last Ditch Resort to Most
Desperate Methods.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 23.â Assemblyman C
G. Raub, chairman of the Committee on Corporations in the lower
house, has been offered a remunerative appointive State office or its
.equivalent in cash as a bribe to enter a secret caucus and vote for
Daniel M. Burns for United States Senator.
Scandal on scandal has marked the progress nf the Mexican's campaign!
for the Senatorship. The names of public men have bpf-n hold up to public
scorn, their reputations have been dragged in thp dust <>f th^ir own dishonor
and the moral sense of the State has been shocked by the Mexican and his
horde of political tricksters, but still there is no end to the revelations of
corruption that is now defiling the capital city.
Evidences of blackmail, bribery and intimidation are forcing their way
almost daily into public view, and now Assemblyman Raub, one of the most
prominent members of the lower house, adds his condemning testimony, that
his name may not be smirched by association with that of Burns.
The agents of the Mexican are playing a desperate game desperately.
When they attempted to bribe Assemblyman Raub they knew they were
treading on ground that might at any moment crumble beneath their feet,
but they are fighting in a lost cause and have given more than one evi
dence of the fact that they will travel even to the gates of the peniten
tiary to win.
Assemblyman Raub first exposed the efforts that had been made to
bribe him at a caucus of the Gra*it forces held last Monday night. Raub is
a stanch supporter of Grant and has been since the opening of the Legisla
ture. His official position as chairman of the Committee on Corporations
and his general abilities make him one of the natural leaders in the camp
of Grant. That a dishonorable and criminal offer should be made to him in
exchange for his vote for Burns shows to what straits of demoralization
the forces of the Mexican have forced themselves.
At the Grant caucus Assemblyman Raub simply outlined the character
of the bribe that had been offered to him. He did not detail the circum
stances under which it was offered. He did no more than to say that a repre
sentative of D. M. Burns had guaranteed to him a remunerative appoint
ive office or its equivalent in cash as a consideration for entering a secret
caucus to cast a vote for D. M. Burns.
Assemblyman Raub was seen last night by a correspondent of The
Call and related in detail every circumstance of the effort made to bribe
him.
"Not long ago," said he, "I was approached by a representative who is a
recognized and very well known agent of Burns. I will not tell his name as I
do not wish to expose him. His offense was dictated by his principal and
that fact is sufficient. This man accosted me and told me that he had
some information of importance for me. I asked him what it was and
then he told me in a whisper what he wanted. He assured me that If I
would go into a caucus he would guarantee me that I would receive an ap
pointment to a good State office, or if preferred, the equivalent of a good
office in money.
"I was astounded at the proposition and its undisguised bribery. I re
plied that if I went into a caucus my action would mean ttiat I was to
vote for D. M. Burns for United States Senator. My visitor answered that,
of course, my action would mean that, but he attempted to persuade me to
his wishes by reminding me that the vote would be a secret one and no
one would know who cast the ballots. I replied that under no circum
stances will I enter a secret caucus nor at any stage of the contest for
United States Senator will I vote for P " -Rums. My candidate is Grant
PRICE FIVE CEISTS.2
I have been loyal to him from the beginning and will remain bo to the end.
This in detail is all there was to the affair."
In reciting these criminal facts of the Senatorial campaign of D. M.
Burns, Assemblyman Raub was extremely reluctant to speak, but his ad
missions made at the Grant caucus had in a measure become public prop
erty and Mr. Raub determined to make a full explanation.
As an affair of public interest the effort made to bribe Assemblyman
Raub ranks with the expose of the disgraceful conduct of Wright, Jilson
and Simpson. In some respects the latest corruption attempted by Burns'
tricksters overshadows the earlier offenses. This is readily explained by
the fact that the Mexican's cause. has become more desperate and his meas
ures to hold his own must be correspondingly desperate.
Mr, Rauh was also asked to explain last night what he understood by a
remunerative appointive office, whether State or Federal. Ha replied that
. he believed, as a matter of course, that reference was made to a State of
fice.
YOUNG MR. WORKS FAILED
TO FOOL GOVERNOR GAGE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- j
MEXTO, Feb. 22.â Governor Gage would !
have none of young Mr. Works' bill for j
the improving of San Diego harbor. Some j
cue had handed out another gold brick ,
to the juvenile Assemblyman, or the rail- I
road has him. The Governor's message |
in which he refuses to sign the bill leads
one to believe it is a case of railroad. In
the bill young Mr. Works gave his active
fancy full play, or allowed some one else
to do so, and as a consequence his effort !
at harbor legislation, if it had passed,
would have drained the State treasury
and kept San Dittco bar in a process of
improvement stretching well into the next
century despite the fact that nature has
done something in the line of harbor
building down there herself.
In discussing the bill in his message j
the Gtoven that the creation of
young Mr. WorKS or his nimble-minded
â  friends contains all the vicious features
of the present laws governing San Diego j
harbor and its Harbor Commissioners, and !
by ingeniously worded amendments so ex
tends and enlarges their powers as to
make them a menace to the rights of the
people and to the commerce of the port.
Referring to the scintillating dreams of i
a. seawall which young Mr. Works has {
been carrying around with him the Gov- i
ernor says there is no need for such a I
â work. The shipping does not warrant the j
immense work which the young law
maker had contemplated, and, besides,
the message says, there is ample natural ;
protection for ships coming and going. j
Another bug which the guileless Mr. !
Works had in his bill was a clause allow
â¢ing the lease of lands by the Harbor j
Commissioners for fifty years. Under the
old law ten years was the limit, ana in j
his message the Governor declares even |
this to be too much. He comments fur- j
ther on the fact that, while the bill lim- j
its the quantity of iand which may be !
leased by individuals, it removes all limit ;
from the amount leased to a railroad.
The objectionable clause is as follows:
"No portion of said lands shall be leased
in one lease in quantity to exceed one
acre, except when leased for railroad pur
poses, nor shall the -leases of more than
three acres in quantity of said lands be |
E^ld at any one public auction, except !
â when leased for railroad purposes."
The land referred to is the water front j
of the harbor.
"'This direct attempt to monopolize the j
beautiful harbor of San Diego," the mes- i
sage reads, "is expressed in the above
unmistakable language. and I am I
amazed at its audacity."
Continuing, the message comments on I
the fact that any bill with such a dan- j
gerous provision in it should pass both
â .nouses of the' Legislature without ques
tion in either. Its escape FhnwS, the Gov
ernor says, the need of close attention,
which should be paid to bills outside the i
scope of legitimate legislation. Tt is [
. strange, he says, that a bill with such a i
. provision should ever get so far as the j
Governor's office. His message concludes j
with a warning against such little jokers j
bs young Mr. Works saw fit to put in his j
tremendous scheme for the betterment of
6an Diego harbor.

"INSTRUCTIONS" GIVEN
UNDER MISAPPREHENSION
STOCKTON, Feb. 23.â The friends of
Burns gleefully announced yesterday
afternoon that they had secured ninety
names of citizens who were delegates to
the late Republican County Convention
to "instructions" for Assemblymen Dun
lap and Muenter to go into caucus. Many
signed under a misapprehension of the
situation. It was represented to them
that the move was calculated solely to
insure the election of a Republican Sena
tor, and they did not take time to ascer
tain that the move was made in the in
terest of the man from Mexico. How
ever, as there were nearly 300 delegates
in the convention the signatures would
not. though given with an understanding,
indicate the will of the rank and file of
the party. Sentiment here is overwhelm
ingly in favor of General Barnes, as was
indicated in recent interviews given in

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24. 1899.
ANTI-CARTOON
BILL BECOMES
A STATE LAW
The Measure Gets Through the Senate and Is
Signed by the Governor.
A POULTICE TO WOUNDED VANITY.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â The anti-cartoon meas
ure of young Mr. Works scratched
through the Senate this afternoon with
the help of Senator Bulla.
It came up on Curtin's motion to recon
sider the vote yesterday, whereby it
failed of passage. There wafc no argu
ment on the question. The motion to re
conelder went to the following vote:
Ayesâ Ashe, Bettman, Boyce, Bulla,
Burnett, Chapman, Curtin, Cutter, Dick
inson, Dory, Feeney, Flint, Gillette, Hoey,
Jones, Leavitt, Maggard, Morehouse,
Nutt, Pace, Rowell, Simpson, Taylor,
Trout and -Wolfeâ 24.
Noesâ Braunhart, Dwyer, La Rue, Luch
singer, Shortridge, Sims and Strattonâ 7.
The rollcall on the bill was then pro
ceeded with, resulting as follows:
Ayesâ Ashe, Bettman, Boyce, Bulla,
Burnett, Chapman Curtin, Cutter, Dick
inson, Feeney, Hoey, Jones, Leavitt. Mag
gard, Morehouse, Nutt. Pace, Simpson,
Taylor, Trout and Wolfeâ 2l.
Noesâ Braunhart, Davis, Doty, Dwyer,
Gillette, La Rue. Luchsinger, Prisk. Row
ell, Shortridge, Sims. Smith, Strattonâ l3.
Absentâ Currier, Flint, Hall, Laird,
Langford-^-5.
The ballot lacked one vote of being car
ried after the roll and the absentees had
been called, and then there was a demand
for a call of the House. It was carried
and the sergeant at arms was instructed
to close the doors. It was then that Bul
la sacrificed himself.
"Mr. President." said he, "to prevent
all this trouble and to end this matter, I
will change my vote from no to aye."
This made the twenty-one. Senator
Shortridge then asked permission to
change his. vote so he could move for a
reconsideration, but he was told a sec
ond reconsideration was prohibited by all
parliamentary rules. The vote was then
announced and the bill was sent back to
the Assembly for consideration of the
amendment by the Senate.
The amendments were by Curtin, ex
empting the provisions of the act from
men in public life, and by Leavitt. forbid
ding cartoons that hold the subject up to
ridicule as well as "hatred and contempt."
The cartoon bill came back into the As
sembly this afternoon that the Senate
amendment attached to it might be con
sidered. When it came to the vote that
was necessary before it went .before the
Governor for his signature it had just
three votes against itâ those of Raw of
El Dorado. L. Hoey of San Francisco and
Feli- f Monterey.
Tl. bill was brought over to the As-
Bembly just as soon as the' Senate had
disposed of it favorably and it was evi
dent that the Assembly had "been already
notified. Bliss of Alameda and Grovel
Johnson had arranged and directed the
programme.
Just as soon as it had been read Bliss
called to Lardner of Nevada to take his
cue. Lardner got up to say he had been
out of town when the bill was passed in
the Assembly, but that he had voted
against it when it had come up on recon
sideration. He paid, however, he would
be glad to vote for it to-day, and he did
so.
Wardell of San Francisco said about the
same thing. Feliz of Monterey said the
Assembly was in no frame of mind to
pass judiciously on any measure and that
if the bill was an iniquitous measure
when it was introduced it was still. Bel
shaw of Contra Costa said he was glad
to have another opportunity to vote for
it. Belshaw stayed in the corridors to
avoid committing himself one way or the
other when the bill first came up and
to-day was the first time he has expressed
an opinion on its merits.
Mr. Cosper of Tulare also took some de
light in backing the measure and it was
passed and sent to the Governor.
To-night the executive sent word to
both houses that he had approved and
signed it and considerable applause went
up forthwith.
TWO MORE VETOES AND
THE REASONS THEREFOR
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â The following mes
sages from the Governor, two In number,
were sent to the Assembly this afternoon.
Both were included in the Governor's
category of "dead" bills, for they were
returned without the gubernatorial ap
proval. The first read as follows:
"To the Assembly of the State of Cali
forniaâl herewith return to your honor
able body without my approval and with
my objection thereto Assembly bill 23, en
titled 'An act to add a new section to the
Penal Code, to be designated as section
354%, making It a misdemeanor to deface,
obliterate, cover up or otherwise remove,
destroy or conceal the duly filed trade
mark or name of another, printed,
stamped, engraved, etched, blown, im
pressed or otherwise attached to or pro
duced upon any cask, keg, bottles, ves
sels, siphon, can or other packages." T
disapprove of this bill amending the
Penal Code because It ignores the intent
with which the acf is done of using or
filling casks, kegs^ bottles, siphons, cans,
cases or other packages, and would make
even innocent acts crimes. To constitute
a crime there must exist a minor or joint
operation of act and intent, etc. (Penal
Code, section 20.)
"I am opposed to the misuse of trade
marks and to Imitations of labels, and 1
am strongly in sympathy with the general
purpose of the bill proposing to give re
lief against frauds upon trademarks,
labels, etc.. but this act is bo broad that
it would subject to punishment the most
Innocent persons. Every person who for
any purpose Should use or fill such ves
sel with home-made catsup, olives or the
like (even though the vessel may have
been bought and sold in general trade and
innocently purchased from another),
yet unless such vessel should, have been
purchased from the owner, or unless the
consent of the owner should have been
given thereto, such innocent purchaser,
by the mere use of such a vessel, is liable
to imprisonment or a hea*'y fine of $500,
or both such imprisonment and fine.
Moreover, so far as the purpose of the
bill is to protect trademarks, this bill is
unnecessary, for the reason that section
554 of the Penal Code affords ample pro
tection.
"Again, there is already a law in force
covering this whole subject, namely, the
act approved March 21, 1891 (Statutes 1891,
page 217). entitled 'An ace to protect the
owners of bottles, boxes, siphons and
kegs used in the sale of soda waters, min
eral or aerated waters, porter, ale, cider,
ginger ale, milk, cream, small beer, beer
or other beverages.'
"Whether the act of March 21. IS9I, be
valid or invalid, it should, at least, be
tested or repealed before seeking further
legislation in this direction.
"If the bill be framed to properly reach
the wrongs intended to be remedied by
this bill, It will hot meet with my disap
proval. HENRY T. GAGE,
"Governor of the State of California."
The other bill Is in regard to the ship
ping of infected fruits, and the message
reads as follows:
"To the Assembly of the State of Cali
fornia: I herewith return to your hon
orable body without my approval .As
sembly bill 157, entitled 'An act to prevent
the shipment of. infected fruits out of the
State of California,' with my objections
thereto.
â¢ "While I warmly approve of the purpose
of the bill, yet it is so unhappily worded
as to Ignore the intent of those packing,
preparing and delivering fruits for ship
ment, and therefore includes within its
penal provisions the most Innocent acts;
hence would work considerable hardship
upon innocent and ignorant employes.
"HENRY T. GAGE,
"Governor of the State of California."
DRURY MELONE ON
PLACERVILLE BONDS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â Drury Melone of Napa,
one of the Placerville bondholders, arrived
here last night. He avers that there
are two sides to the controversy concern
ing Senate bill 648, and contends that the
general law proposed is a just and equit
able measure. He desires that there .shall
be the fullest investigation of the pro
posed law and expresses the wish that a
committee of Placerville's leading citi
zens may meet him in the presence of any
committee oc all the members of the
Legislature to discuss the proposition in
volved.
He says the holders of the Placerville
bonds were innocent purchasers and con
fends that the contractor built the rail
road. The city that Issued the bonds, so
Mr. Melone avers, is now receiving the
benefits of the road. Judgment has been
obtained in the courts, but for twenty
years the town has had no officers on
which summons may be served.
When attempts are made to compel mu
nicipal officers to levy a tax to pay prin
cipal or interest of the bonds the officers
resign, leaving no one in authority to ex
ecute the commands of the court. All of
these assertions will be presented to the
Legislature by Melone. He will give
names of the bondholders and designate
the price paid for the bonds by Inno
cent purchasers. He contends that the
methods of repudiation adopted by Pla
cerville are calculated to bring discredit
on the State. He asks that the Legis
lature, through the proper channel, obtain
all the facts in the case.
One Veto and Three Approvals.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â Senate bill 151, provid
ing for the release of the bondsmen of
J N E. Wilson, has been hit with the
Governor's veto ax. The bill is to re
lease the. payment to the State of $13,000
â which Wilson, as Insurance Commission
er had collected and deposited in the Pa
cific Bank just before it failed. The Gov
ernor vetoed the bill because he said it
Is prohibited by the constitution to release
a claim of the State.
The Governor has approved Senate bill
593, providing an appropriation of JroOO to

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-,
MENTO, Feb. 23.â 1t was a somewhat |
tropical afternoon in the Assemblyâ it
had been so since the arrival of the 11
o'clock train, which brings up the San
Francisco morning papers. Threats of
bodily harm, condemnations and even
curses, not so loud as deep, echoed
through the corridors and made the at
mosphere of the Assembly murky
more murky even than is its customary
condition of an afternoon. Those mem
bers whose knuckles have been rapped
since the beginning of the session gath
ered in groups and squads and held
council in whispers as to what might
be done to rid themselves of those per
sistent monitors of the public press who
refuse to shut their eyes and let the
game go on without interruption.
What the Assemblymen would do â
as said with bated breath by hangers
on to the outer rim of the third house â
was quite dire and dreadful, and also
quite different from what they did do,
of which the following is an unbiased
record:
The Senate special file was attended
to- with somewhat remittent attention,
and at its close Melick of Pasadena rose
and offered a resolution, prefacing with
some remarks on journalism, which,
coming from one who is himself of the
guild, were entitled to and received at
tention and applause.
Melick's resolution was as follows:
Whereas, The caricaturing of public
officials, especially of certain legislators,
by the San Francisco Call and Examiner
has passed the line of common decency;
Whereas. Such work is outside the
realms of legitimate journalism which
strives to ennoble and build up true
manhood, womanhood and good govern
ment as against the personal malicious
ness and viciousness of yellow journal
ism; therefore be it
Resolved. That this Assembly hereby
puts its seal of severest condemnation on
the unwise, unjust and diabolical, work
of those newspapers as representing the
-malicious spite of persona! organs and
outside the pale of true Journalism; and
Resolved, That this Assembly hereby
especially condejnns and censures as ma
licious cowardly and brutal the treatment

EXPOSITION RESOLUTION
FAILED OF PASSAGE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â Assembly joint resolu
tion 12. submitted by Sfciator O'Brien,
failed to pass the Senate this afternoon.
The resolution was one providing for a
request to the Federal Government to
make some appropriation for the Pacific
Coast Exposition and to provide a Gov
ernment exhibit. The resolution was be
fore the Senate some days ago, and was
passed on file because the'bills providing
for a State appropriation had not yet been
considered. The resolution came up again
to-day and failed of passage by a vote
Braunhart, who had voted for the reso
lution, wanted to reconsider the vote, but
he had not changed from aye to no before
the result was announced, so he was de
clared out of order. Senator Chapman
came to the relief of the resolution by giv
ing notice of a motion to reconsider.
Chapman had voted against the resolu-

opportunity in Melick's resolution to
swing his little ax, and he got to work
with the folltfwing amendment:
The representatives of The Call are
hereby denied admission to aiid privileges
of the floor of this Assembly.
Wright's amendment precipitated a
general epidemic of cold feet. So long
as the censure was general most of the
House was willing to stand for it, but
when it was about to become speciflu
there was a general retreat. Grove
Johnson called from his seat and de
manded that the ex-Speaker withdraw
hie proposal. Melick seconded him and
the dollar-marked ex-Speaker senten
tiously announced that in deference to
the magnanimous request of Grovel he
would do so.
Then Assemblyman Burnett of San
Luis Obispo County made an attempt
to play even for the scoring he got for
trying to introduce Willie Hearst of
New York as the Senatorial choice of
the minority.
In a speech of no small dimensions
he said that fhe freedom of the press
has come to be the license of the press
and that it was high time it was
curbed. Mr. Burnett thought, however,
that it should be curbed only so far as
The Call was concerned and he offered
an amendment to Melick's resolution
striking out the word Examiner, leav
ing The Call to stand alone, the censure
that the southerner's amendment em
bodied.
Melick objected and asked why The
Call should stand alone when all of
the San Francisco newspapers had
been guilty of exaggerating the facial
blemishes that characterize the Assem-
bly. , .
Burnett declined to answer, and sim
ply insisted upon his amendment. It
was put to a vote and net one voice
was raised in its favy.
Then Melick got up to make some
further remarks upon newspapers in
general and the vote upon his resolu
tion followed. It was adopted almost
unanimously, and The Call and Ex
aminer retired for the half hour fol
lowing for the purpose of feeling mor
tified.
Cowan of Santa Rosa fittingly wound
up the afternoon's hysterics with tH<*
following resolution, which was adoat
ed:

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 23.â Sixty-one ballots
and still no United States Senator.
Such Is the completed record of the day
In the Le#slature. with nothing to in
dicate a change in the immediate fu
ture except the slow increase on the
total number of ballots taken since the
beginning of the session.
Since the opening of the present Sen
atorial campaign The Call has been
engaged in the unpleasant task of pro
tecting the interests of the people of I
the State against the machinationsof |
a coterie of politicians who have no j
other object in view than personal gain j
and political preferment. To jcain their J
ends these men have not hesitated to |
bring 10 their aid every corrupt influ- j
ence known to those who make poli
tics a trade.
Some of the men and many of their
methods have been exposed by this
paper during the course of the past few
sveeks. What has been done in this line
is familiar to the reading public. What
is not so familiar are the details of the
campaign that have made such ex
posures necessary. Only those who are
here in Sacramento can have a con
ception of what unheard of and un
speakable methods are being employed
in an effort to secure the election of a
man to the United States Senate who
is obnoxious to a great majority of the
people of the State. To effectively right
such men and such methods it becomes
necessary to employ the most drastic
methods. To do so is not a pleasant j
task, but it is a duty that a great news- j
paper owes to the people. To perform
thfs duty is the task The Call has set
for itself and it will not be deterred by
either political pulls, corporation in
fluence or personal threats.
In the Chronicle this morning ap
peared an editorial of which the follow- j
ing paragraph seems to fit the situa
tion :
"Th<s Republican party had rather
go without a Senator for two years
than to have one who would disgrace
it for six."
The sentence expresses tersely the
Beniiment of the majority of the Legis
lature and it reflects the feeling and
convictions of the best people of Cali
fornia. The sentiment is gaining ad
herents every day.
To-night the belief is stronger than
ever that Burns cannot win. He has |
the power to create confusion in the
Legislature and prevent the enact
ment of laws that several of the legis
lators deem necessary, but the exercise
of that power will not increase his vote. I
Last week the touts designated Thurs
day of this week as the day that the
"colonel" would receive his commis
sion as United States Senator. To-day
he received twenty-five votes on Joint
ballot. In six weeks he has gained but
three votes.
The statement was published in the
Bee this evening that Thomas R. Bard
had withdrawn from the contest and
returned to his home in Ventura. To
night Mr. Bard was seen at his rooms,
611 X street. He remarked that he
would probably go to San Francisco
next Saturday and return here Monday
next. He has derived some encourage
ment from his friends and supporters
and will see what can be done in the
â¢way vt consolidating the Southern Cali
fornia forces. Since his arrival here all
the Senatorial candidates other than
Colonel Burns have paid him the cour
tesy of a visit and the courteous caJls
have been returned.
The Grant forces are firm to-night
and more confident than usual. It is
â whispered on the inside of the camp
that a defection exists in the Burns
fold which threatens a loss to the
"colonel" of six votes. It is known
that several followers of Burns are lan
guishing for more evidence of increas
ing strength than wise looks. Every
day's delay in getting a caucus also
adds to the impatience of Herrin. who
has been informed that a railroad vic
tory cannot be won without a caucus.
Xn view of those delays and complica
tions the touts are not encouraged.
Since Simpson betrayed his constitu
ents of the southland not a single
gleam of hope has brightened the hori
jgon of the "organization."
Last evening the touts were exultant,
claiming that Assemblyman Muenter
had made up his mind to retire from
General Barnes" column and cast his
vote for Dan Burns. When the roll
â¢was called in Joint assembly to-day
jj r , Muenter voted as usual for General
Barnes. On the second ballot to-day
he cast his vote in the same way.
The chairman of the Republican
County Committee of San Joaquin
County is preparing a petition signed
by delegates to the convention which
nominated the Assemblyman to Induce
the latter to change his position. Mr.
Muenter is advised by many leading
Republicans that four-fifths of the
voters in his county prefer that Gen
eral Barnes should be elected Senator.
The balloting to-day was not sig
nificant. It was supposed that the sec
ond ballot, which seemed to be demand
ed plike by the Burns and Grant forces,
â would develop some changes, but none
.â¢were developed. The deadlock is as
firm as <- .er with no signs of breaking.
There is talk that all the members of
the Legislature from Southern Califor
nia may decide to vote solidiy several
times for . jomas R. Bard, but the
movement in this direction has not
gained much headway. It is clear to
fair and impartial observers that the
only way to the deadlock is for
p M Burns to retire from the contest.
He is exhausting the patience of the
people and the party by insisting that
the Legislature shall give him a vindi
cation.
Members of the Legislature are re
ceiving expressions of opinion from all
parts of the State to the effect that no
SenaW would be preferable to the elec
tion of Burns. It is asserted that his
election would disrupt the party. Should
no Senator be chosen at this session of
the Legislature the Republican party
could go before the people of this State
and say that the party representatives
refused to take orders from the South
ern Pacific and the "machine."
The Call is in possession of informa
tion that means no more creditable
than those employed to lure . Senator
Simpson from the line of duty to his
constituents have been employed, and
are now being used, to swerve an Ala
meda Assemblyman from his obliga
tions to decency and clean politics. His
friends are advised of the scheme and
are closely watching the game.
Certain facts brought to light this
I week will be placed before the Minister
j lal Unions of California in orde r that
I the moral forces of the State may clear
i ly understand the debasing Influences

I islature to violate their obligations. The

RAILROAD LITIGATION
REQUIRES MUCH MONEY
Report of Attorney General Ford on
the Existing Cases.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â Pursuant to a resolu
tion by White of San Francisco adopted
by the Assembly a week ago Attorney
General Tirey L. Ford to-day rendered a
report upon all litigations now pending
n which the Railroad Commissioners are
either plaintiff or defendant against the
railroads of the State. He also rendered
an estimate of the expenses that will ac
crue before the present cases are brought
to an issue.
Mr. Ford estimates that it will require
$30,000 for future attorneys' fees alone;
$31,500 has been already paid out for the
same purpose.
Assemblyman Burnett of San Luis Obls
po County on Monday introduced in. the
Assembly a bill which appropriates $20,000
for the maintenance of the ; suits now
pending, particularly the grain rate case.
Mr. Ford's report is as follows:

Southern Pacific Company vs. Board of Rail- !
road Commissioners. United\ States Circuit
Court.
â¢To better understand the nature and purpose !
of this suit It may be well to briefly suggest
the causes which gave It birth. \
On September 12. 1895. the Board of Railroad
Commissioners : adopted a resolution, upon
which a schedute of 'rates was based, and by
which an eight per cent reduction In grain
rates was sought to be established.
On the following day, September 13, 1895, the '
I board adcsted another resolution looking: to i
' a general reduction of freight rates, other thaw
I upon grain, to the extent of twenty-five per
cent, of such rates as they existed on Decem- !
ber 1, 1894. No schedule was ever adopted un- j
der this resolution. â¢' -i , â â¢
On October 14, 1895, the Southern Pacific Com- j
pany, against whom the above resolutions were '
directed, filed a. bill of equity in the United
States Circuit Court for the Northern District j
of California by which it was sought to re- â¢
strain the Board of Railroad Commissioner-*
from proceeding under the foregoing 'resolu
tions.' â¢'- ' *
- ; A temporary restraining order having been
Issued by the court, an" injunction pending the
trial of the cause was sought by the Southern
Pacific Company, the hearing upon which, from
various causes, was delayed until January 6,
1896. " â :
The hearing of this motion. Including two
continuances, occupied some four months, the
argument alone occupying twenty-nine days.
The motion was then taken under advisement
by the court.
On November 30, 1896, the court made its
order continuing the Injunction as to the pro
posed eight per cent reduction in grain rates,
but refusing to further enjoin proceedings;un
der the so-called twenty-five per cent reduc
tion, the board having disclaimed any inten
tion of proceeding under the latter resolution'
without further investigation.
On January 23. 1897, the Board of Railroad
Commissioners filed their a newer to the bill
of complaint, and â¢ on February 17, 1897. the
Southern Pacific Company filed Its replication
thereto. . â  â  > '
Exceptions to the answer were filed and re
ferred to the Master In Chancery, upon whose
report and after argument by counsel, the court
entered an order allowing such exceptions in
part and denying them In. part.
This last-named order, was made on April 25,
1898. whereupon ' the cause became at issue and I
the taking. testimony was thereupon begun.
The complainant (the Southern Pacific Com

Referring to the probable future costs and
expenses necessary to secure a final determina
tion of the case last above referred to. I desire
to state that it is Impossible to estimate with
any degree of accuracy the amount of such
costs and expenses, but It is safe to assume
that they will not fall below the amounts above
Indicated.
In the matter of fees of expert, the amount
has been placed at $30,000. This Is believed to
be a conservative estimate of the amount nec
essary to secure the indispensable aid of those
who are skilled in the many and complicated
matters necessary to be examined in the prose
cution of the defense. In a .communication ad
dressed to the Board of Railroad Commission
! ere. under date of January 20 list. I estimated <
I the expense of experts at $25,000, and reeom
| mended to the board that they ask for that
; amount at the hands of the Legislature. Since
then, however, and upon consultation with spe
cial counsel In the case, I am convinced that
the appropriation for expert fees should not
be less than the amount first above indicated.
In my opinion the employment of experts Is
Indispensable to the presentation of a proper
defense, !n which opinion I am Joined by as
sociate counsel.
Referring to the matter of attorney's feps.
I will state that the continued employment by
the Board of Railroad Commissioners of spe
cial counsel as heretofore, that Is to say. three
In number, cannot well be done for less than
$30,000. in addition to the $31,050 already paifl or
Incurred. It is not necessary, however, that
the entire $30,000 should be appropriated at the
present session of the Legislature, though I
I would suggest that a payment of $2500 on ac
; count to each of such special oounpel as may
be continued in the case would be a proper
and appropriate course to pursue.
The other items of probable future costs
above enumerated are clearly Indispensable and
are certainly conservative.
The amount of the last named Items, as also
the amount of attorneys' fees, will depend in
no small degree upon the length of time occu
pied In reaching a final determination of the
case. So far. some three and one-half years
have been consumed since the commencement
of the suit. Upon the conclusion of the taking
of the testimony the case will come up for trial
In the United States Circuit Court, from which
an appeal lies to the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals, whence an appeal may lie
taken to the Supreme Court of the United
a States. Tou will thus perceive the difficulties
attendant upon an attempt to .comply with the
request of your honorable body to nsport
"amount of funds necepsary to carry on said
litigation to a final determination." Respecf
fully, TIREY L. FORD. Attorney General.

BARRY'S LAND PATENT
BILL ROUGHLY HANDLED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 23.â Assemblyman Barry's
bill concerning the patenting of lands be
longing to the State received a rough
handling in the Senate this afternoon,. not
so much from the words of the Senators
as from their votes, which was much
worse.
Barry's bill was to amend section 3519
and repeal section 3521 of the Political
Code, which refer to swamp, overflowed,
tide lands, or lands uncovered by the re
cession of an inland lake. The amend
ment to section 3519 added the reference
to the "recession" lands. The repealing
of section 3521 repeals that portion of the
code which provides that the completion
of the patent to public lands could not
be accomplished under a year.
Senator Smith of Kern County, Senator
Gillette of Humboldt and Senator Davis !
of Amador opposed the bill, all declaring
that pressure had been brought to bear j
on them In its favor, and therefore they |
considered the measure a suspicious one. J
Smith showed that the amendment to j
3519 referred to the gradually uncovering |
basin of Lake Tulare, whose waters had j
receded from over 125,000 acres. He de- \
clared that the year required to perfect {
a patent was a necessary safeguard to
allow the Government time to detect
fraud, and he believed if the section were j
repealed so as to allow the perfection of
a patent at once, it would lead to end
less trouble and litigation.
Gillette spoke in a similar strain. He,
too, had been deluged with letters ask
ing his support for the bill, but he de
clared it was a bad measure. The bill j
then went to a vote and was refused j
passage by a vote of 20 to 8.
There is another bill now pending which
provides that recession lands may be tak
enen up in the same way as swamp and !
overflow lands, and in this lies the joker j
In the case of the Tulare Lake basin. Un- i
der ordinary circumstances $2 50 an acre j
must be paid before a patent on public ;
land will issue, but in the case of swamp i
and overflow lands, only 20 per cent of [
this sum is demanded, and when it can be i
shown that the land has been permanent- !
ly reclaimed My levees, this 20 per cent is !
returned to the holder. Under these two |
bills the rich basin of Tulare Lake can ,
be filed on. patented at once under the !
payment or but 20 per cent of the usual |
price and then when the land has been i
reclaimed, this will be refunded, not a i
mean saving, this one of 50 cents on each
one of 125,000 acres.
Senator Davis wanted to know how it
was that a man from San Francisco in-;
troduced the bill, and how it Was that \
San Francisco land agents were the ones i
who were so earnestly advocating Its i
passage. He knew of no lands uncovered i
by inland lakes near San Francisco, and
he thought the bill would come with a
better grace from some legislator whose
district possessed some of the lands to be
affected
There was a notice of reconsideration
given, but those who opposed the bill !
have no fear that another vote will
change the result.
POOL SELLING TALK
OCCUPIES THE SENATE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- j
MENTO, Feb. 23.â Senator Braunhart's |
anti-pool selling bill was up before the |
Senate again to-day, but got no farther
than the defeat of a few more amend
ments.
Senator Ashe submitted the first amend
ment, one which was practically a sub
stitute for the first section of the bill.
In it he provided that racing be limited
to sixty days a year in each county, and
in presenting his amendment he did. so,
he said, at the suggestion and advice of
prominent horsemen with whom he had
consulted since the introduction of the
bill.
Braunhart, although he said he wished
to see pool selling stopped altogether, de
clared himself in favor of the amendment.
Senator Ashe's amendment, however, had
no reference to pool selling in addition
to those already in the original bill.
Leavltt declared the horsemen he had
talked to had told him they could not
afford to bring strings of horses out
here If racing was restricted any more
than it is. He thought racing was a le
gitimate business and should be protected,
a remark that brought Senator Boyce to
his feet. He said it was the same old
I case â the people had slept on their rights
and had permitted an enormity to grow
until it had reached such a strength that
it could raise itself and demand protec
tion. He compared racing and pool sell
ing to the Louisiana lottecy, and the way
in which the Government had had to ban
ish the evil altogether after trying for
years to restrict it.
Wolfe opposed both bill *nd amend
ment. Rowell favored both, and Short
ridge opposed the whole proposition, be
cause, he said, he objected to having the
Legislature regulate everything.
Ashe closed the debate with a ringing
speech in favor of clean racing, and the
direction in which the game is now tend-
On rollcall the amendment was lost by
a vote of 19 to 15.
Senator Jones then submitted an
amendment preventing pool Belling any-

Senator Leavitt's bill, providing for the
creation of the harbor of Oakland and for
the appointment of a Board of Harbor
Commissioners, was passed.
Senator La Rue's bill, to provide an ap
propriation for the building of a dam and.
i a reservoir for the Napa Insane Asylum,
was passed. The original bill provided for
an appropriation of $150,000. This was cut
by committee amendments to $75,000. and
! then an amendment to cut this to $30,QU0
' was lost. As passed the bill provides for
! an appropriation of $75,000.
Senator Â©oty's bill, allowing the sale
of the State fair, property in Sacramento
and the reimbursement of the county for
the money it had expended on the place,
| was passed. Â .
Senator Stratton's bill to provide for
! reducing the expenses of municipal elec
' tlons when held separate from general
elections was passed. It allows a reduc
i ton in the number of election officers in
the booths and for the consolidation of
I the precincts in order to reduce their
j number for that particular election. Sen
ator Stratton's bill providing that when
the County Clerk of any county is charg
ed with the duty of registration, the Su
pervisors shall assist him financially and
allow him more clerks, was also passed.
This was the bill introduced in order to
help Frank J^dan, the County Clerk of
Alameda County, after his own county
delegation had refused his remiest for
much-needed assistance at the hands of
thp Legislature.
Stratton's bill relating to the law of ne-
I eotiable instruments was also passed.
Senator Curtln was incorrectly represent
ed In yesterday's reports. It was stated
that he moved to amend the rues so as
to remove the lhnlt of attorneys f ees al-

was that no fees at all all be allowed.

SUPERVISORS CLOSE
WATER RATE INQUIRY
COMMITTEE WILL REPORT A
SCHEDULE MONDAY.
Civil Engineer Allardt Tells How the
Big Monopoly Forever Shut Out
Possible Competition.
The Board of Supervisors last night
completed its investigation preparatory to
fixing the water rates for the coming
year. In endeavoring to ascertain the
value of the Spring Valley plant, in actual
use, several protracted meetings of the
board, in committee of the whole, have
been held. Attorney Morgan for the
water consumers has attempted to show
that the monopoly is collecting interest
from the public on a fictitious valuation,
far In excess of the actual value of its
plant. The Spring Valley has, as usual,
controverted these arguments and the re
sult of the oratorical contest will be
known next Monday, at 10:30 oclock,
when the Water Committee reports to the
board and a rate is adopted.
At the request of the ratepayers Colo
nel George H. Mendell and George F.
Allardt, the civil engineers, were sum
moned to appear before the board last
evening and testify. Charles Webb How
ard, president of the Spring Valley Com
pany, was also cited. Mr. Allardt was
the only witness who appeared. Mr.
Howard sent word that he had missed
his train at San Mateo. Attorney M. B.
Kellogg, Secretary Pelham Ames and
Chief Engineer Herman Schussler were
\at the meeting to guard the interests of
the water company.
Engineer Allardt was the only witness
examined. He gave testimony- for both
sides and added nothing new to the per
ennial controversy between the board and
the water company. . Allardt's testimony
was a recital of the purchase of the Cal
averaa water supply, in Contra Costa
County, when the city sought to buy the
same "property in 1874. The water, com
pany got in ahead of the Supervisors, and
by securing the only adequate and avail
able source of water supply, besides that
of the Spring Valley, shut out forever
any possible competition.-
Mr. Allardt said the Calaveras plant
was not necessary to the Spring Valley,
but its purchase was a good business
stroke to protect its stockholders.
It was shown that the water company
had a complete monopoly of the Alameda
Creek supply, of which the Calaveras
Creek is the principal feeder, and that
this plant alone could supply San Fran
cisco with water for many years, or until
we have a population of 500,000.
Attorneys Morgan and Kellogg had
two or three warm arguments and Su
pervisors Perrault and Byington took a
hand, with the Mayor interrogating the
witness. After an hour and a half of
dreary figures Perrault moved that the
investigation be declared closed and re
ferred to the Water Committee, with In
structions to report a schp ' . â¢_ . rates
next Monday, at 10:30 a. m., and the mo
tion carried.
THE CLOSE OF THE
SYMPHONY SEASON
The last concert of the symphony sea- j
son took place yesterday afternoon. The |
programme was again changed for that j
which had been previously announced
and Dvorak's "New World" symphony !
was played instead of the "Pathetique"
of Tschalkowsky. Much disappointment
was expressed, as this being the last con
cert of the present series there is iÂ»ot now
another opportunity of hearing the "Pa
thetique," which made such a sensation
last season. The concert opened with
Weber's "Oberon" overture, and after the
symphony Wagner's Vorspiel, from act
3 of "Die Meistersinger," Siegfried's Fu
neral March from "Die Gotterdammer
ung" and the "Tannhauser" overture
were played, so that there were no novel
ties. â¢ Indeed, at none of thÂ« 'last three
concerts has there, been any important
novelty. The orchestra was in fairly good
condition, but the brass was, as it often
is blatant and insecure. In parts of the
symphony and in giving out the first
theme of the "Tannhauser" overture this
was especially noticeable. There were
more satisfactory performances of the
Weber overture and the other Wagner
numbers. Mr. Scheel led the symphony
with his accustomed enthusiasm, and, ex
cept for the occasional failure of the
brass, the orchestra responded fairly well.

WHEEL RACE WON
BY A DEAD MAN
Although Stricken on the Last Lap
Young Son)erville Crossed
th)e Tape F^st.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Feb. 23.â Australian advices by the steamship
Miowera, which arrived here to-day, tell of a remarkable bicycle race In
Sydney which was won by a dead man. It occurred at a big electric
light carnival held Just before the steamship sailed. In a one-mile race
there were fifty entries, some of the fastest men In Australia taking
part In It. While 10,000 people watched this particular race, which was
for a magnificent cup, offered by the trustees of the Sydney Cricket Club,
young James Somerville passed under the tape a winner and a dead
man. At the start he quickly forged ahead, closely followed by an
other crack rider named Percy Cliff. They left for,ty-eight riders away
in the rear and shot around the brilliantly lighted track almost wheel to
wheel. The applause was deafening as the men struck the last lap.
When within twenty-five yards of the tape Somerville, who still led by
half a wheel, was seen to relax his hold on the handlebars. His ped
als whirled around, however, and he pluckily held his position on the
wheel. Five yards from the tape Cliff put on a tremendous spurt and
struck Somerville's hind wheel, shooting the machine with its' then al
most Inanimate burden like a rocket under the tape. The crowd yelled
â¢ wildly, but a silence like death ensued when Somerville, after crossing
the tape, plunged headforemost from the machine on the hard track.
When he was picked up he was dead. The doctors who examined
him immediately afterward said that a dead man had by the strangest
freak of fate and fortune actually won the hottest cycle race ever wit
nessed in Australia. They declared that the unfortunate rider must
have been stricken with heart failure when he was first seen to relax
his hold on the handlebars on the last lap. How he succeeded in finish
ing the race is a puzzle to them. In the race in which young Somerville
won the cup and lost his life fifteen riders were injured. They claimed
the electric lights were uncertain. In sporting circles an effort is being
made to do away with night tracks, as It is claimed they are dangerous.
The government will be petitioned to this effect.

PICKPOCKETS BECOME BOLD.
Kittle Fitzgibbon Demands a Jury
Trial, Hoping to Be Acquitted.
Owing to the action of the jury in the
! case of John Piggott, the notorious pick-
I pocket, last Tuesday, vagrants and pick
pockets have become bold and are now
demanding jury trials in the hope of
meeting with the same luck as Piggott.
Yesterday Kittie Fitzgibbon, a clever
pickpocket and a friend of Maud Rice
and Dene Smith, who got two years a
few days ago, appeared before Judge
Conlon on a charge of vagrancy. She
promptly demanded a jury trial, and the
Judge continued the case until to-morrow,
at the same time ordering her into cus
tody and fixing her bonds at Â»200.J<>hn
\V. Coats was arrested on a similar
charge, and the police allege that he acts
as a scout for pickpockets around the
principal hotels. He waived a jury trial
! and the Judge also ordered him into cus
tody and fixed his bonds at $1200.
James Fisher, a pickpocket, was up for
preliminary examination before the Judge
for extracting a pnrse from the pocket
of C H Crowell, a teacher, on February
12 at Folsom-street wharf. The case was
partly heard, and the Judge ordered him
! into custody and fixed, his bonds at $3000
The Judge said that in future he would
deal severely with well-known pick
pockets arrested for vagrancy and would
i make it a rule that they must be present
I in court at each calling of the case if they
happened to be out on bonds.
Fire in Sunset Valley.
Fire broke out in the one-story frame
residence on Forty-sixth avenue, be
tween I and J streets, owned and oc
cupied by Thomas MacMullen, at about
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. A high
wind was blowing at the time, and in less
than an hour the building was in ashes.
Mr. MacMullen's two children were sick
in the house, but both were got out in
safety and made as comfortable as possi
ble at the residence of a "neighbor. The
loss is about $1200, partially covered by
lnsurance. The fire Is supposed to have
been caused by sparks from a stove
igniting the woodwork in the kitchen.

DOCfORS^FIQBfING HARD.
Measures Introduced in the Legis-
latures of Several States to
Throttle Competition.
There Is trouble brewing for thÂ«
specialist who advertises his methods
of curing disease. It is Intended aa
well for all colors and kinds of adver-
tising doctors, and especially is it di-
rected against those who have made
electricity their special agent for the
relief of suffering humanity. This class
has been the sharpest thorn in the side
of the regular practitioner, who sees
his trade being ruined by the growing
popularity of Electricity as a vitalizing
agent. The repeated successes in dif-
ficult cases by using electricity, and the
awakening of the people who want
treatment to the fact that medicine is
a back number, are taking patients
away from the doctors and they are go-
ing to use their influence to have laws
passed by the State Legislature which
will prohibit the sale of such articles
as are intended to compete with drug's
as a cure for disease. In Colorado,
Oregon and California measures have
been offered calculated to place diffi-
culties in the path of the advertising
doctors; those whose plan is to cure
with electricity, such as Dr. McLaugh-
lin, with his famous Dr. Sanden Elec-
tric Belt. The osteopaths and other
kinds of specialists are also aimed at
blue and her eyes swollen so she could
not see for several days. It is only the
past several days that she has been out
of bed. The affair was kept quiet, and
only leaked out a few days ago. The Po
lice Department began an investigation,
with the result that Policeman Campbell
swore to a warrant on which Treadwell
was arrested to-day. The young capital
ist was at once arrested and locked up.
He occupied a cell about two hours be
fore he succeeded in getting bail, which
was fixed at $100. Thomas Treanor and
G. T. Bollinger, Treadwell's guardian,
finally went his security. His trial has
been set for February 27.
This is not Treadwell's first escapade,
and the police have given him notice that
he must mend his ways or they will "vag"
him. For some time he had been living
with the Woods woman. He inflicted the
brutal punishment while engaged in a
drunken orgy and without any apparent
cause.

The game of baseball played here yester
day afternoon was the most exciting here
this season. Both teams played in splen

til the last of the ninth inning, when.
Charlie Doyle, the premier pitcher of the
coast; cleared the bases with a three
bagger. Doyle's playing was easily the
feature of the game, and he proved be
yond a doubt that he is not only a great
pitcher, but an excellent batter. The
Newarks were greatly strengthened by the
addition of ODea and Andrews, late of

Mrs. Young Acquitted of Arson.
fcAN RAFAEL, Feb. 23.â A jury acquit
ted Mrs. AugiiFta Young of Tiburon of
the charge of arson, in seventeen minute 3
this evening, and the woman is now free
to return to her home. The principal
event of the day was the testimony of
Mrs Barnum, who corroborated that of
Miss Matilda Lutzone in several particu
lars. The most of the day was spent in
summoning witnesses and trying to prove
'the bad character of the witnesses for
the prosecution. Mrs. Young also took
the stand in her own behalf. The evi
dence against Mrs. Young was clear, but
sympathy for her sex is believed to have
caused her acquittal. During the day her
baby was brought in to herâ many be
lieve by a prearranged agreementâ and
upon her making a rush to grab it Judge
Angellotti was obliged to have Sherifl
Taylor remove the child from the room.
I The purpose of these bills is to make
it impossible for any but the regular
pill grinder to do business, irrespective
I of what the man who takes the pill
1 thinks of it.
Being a doctor is simply a trade â a
) means of livelihoodâ hence competition
hurts as it does in any other line of
trade. It is natural that doctors should
kill off competition when they can. It
would be a strange thing to hear a doc-
tor recommend his patient to use one of
Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belts, yet
these belts have a record of over 10,000
â  cures accomplished during the past
; three years. Most of these cures were
i of cases where drugs had failed to do
! any permanent good, and the claim.
} made by Dr. McLaughlin that elec-
tricity is the basis of all human vitality
seems well founded.
The man who has not done much
! doctoring can take his choice, but the
i one who has used his stomach as a
I dumping ground for all the various
I forms of antidotes, stimulants and se-
l datives prescribed by medical men can
I get relief from these and a cure for

GROOM GROVER
CLEVELAND FOR
A THIRD TERM
It Is Said That He Will Open His
Fight at the Carl Schurz
Dinner.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â A Princeton (N. J.) special
to the Herald says: Great interest was aroused in Prince
ton this morning by the announcement that Grover Cleve
land, former President of the United States, would deliver
an address on March 2 at a dinner to be given at Del
monico's in honor of Carl Schurz's seventieth birthday.
The subject of his speech has not been given out, but
it is conjectured that he will outline his position in regard
to "Expansion" and "Imperialism" as the permanent pol
icy of the United States more fully than he has done. It
is believed here that this address will be of unusual signifi
cance, and it is thought in some quarters that it will mark
the beginning of an attempt on the part of Mr. Cleveland' 3
friends to bring him back into public life.
Mr. Cleveland has been greatly moved by recent de
velopments of the national policy and, as is well known, he
is bitterly opposed to territorial expansion; so it is thought
probable that his opinions upon this point will lead him to
try to have a clause against "Imperialism" inserted in the
Democratic platform of 1900. If this succeeds, it is believed
that his friends will try to nominate him on the Dem
ocratic ticket for a third term in the Presidency.
HAWAIIAN JURIST
CULLED TO REST
Hermann A. Widemann's
Death at Honolulu.
Bpe<-lal Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Feb. 15.â After a long
and painful Illness Hon. Hermann A.
Widemann. ex-Associate Justice of the ]
Supreme Court of Hawaii, died on the j
7th inst. Judge Widemann was a man .
of strong and forceful character, of in
domitable perseverance and untiring
energy. Save for his early military j
â education he was. like so many promi
nent men of this age, the architect of
fala own substantial fortune. Sensitive j
to a degree in connection with his prin- I
ciples he was firmly loyal to the mon
anchial institutions and traditions of
Hawaii, and ever remained a firm and
true friend of the rtetive race, and thus
became an active and prominent cham
pion of the cause of Queen Liliuokalani
in the darkest hours of her trouble. His j
place in Hawaiian history will not only
be marked by the many important offi
ces held by him and trusts faithfully j
discharged, but more particularly by j
his efforts in connection with coffee and
sugar planting interests. In which he
was one of Hawaii's early pioneers.
His funeral was one of the largest j
and most notably attended since the
death of the monarchy, although, at
his especial request, it was shorn of all
pageantry, save that of a police escort
and the government band playing j
funeral marches at the grave. Among |
those present were the President and j
his Cabinet, the ex-diplomatic and con- j
sular corps, the judiciary and ban and j
so large a gathering of representative
citizens of all shades of politics and j
notably of Hawaiians, that the large j
Catholic cathedral scarcely contained j
those desirous of paying their last re
spects.
Hermann A. Widemann was born at I
Hildeshelm, Hanover, December 24,
1522, and had consequently passed his
seventy-sixth year. His father was a |
veteran of the Napoleonic wars of 1812
--15 and fought through -campaigns in
France and Russia with considerable
distinction, and Hermann was selected
to follow his father's profession and
therefore received an excellent educa
tion. He left. the army, however, im
patient of the delay in obtaining pro
motion, which in those days came more
from influence than merit.
A brief commercial experience proved
uncongenial to hia restless and ambi
tious mind and he deserted that life for
the sea, shipping as a cabin boy in 1840.
After serving for two years in the Bal
tic and Mediterranean he shipped on a
whaler for the Pacific and landed at
Honolulu In 1843. After a cruise in the
Arctic he returned to Honolulu and
thence went to Europe to study naviga
tion. In 1846 he decided to make the
Hawaiian Islands his home and com
menced his career as private tutor In
the Brown family. In 1848 the Cali
fornia gold fever seized him and he
rushed to the coast, tried and failed at |
mining, served for a short time in the
< 'u.stom House at San Francisco and .
returned to the islands for good in 1849. j
He quickly entered into political life '
and during this career held numerous j
high offices of importance and trust.
In 1850 he married Mary Kauai, a Ha
waiian lady of distinguished family, by
whom he had two sons and seven
daughters â Carl, manager of the Wai
anae coffee plantation and one of the
leaders and field fighters of the royalist
rebellion of 1895; Hermann, holding a
position In the office of John D. Spreck
â els Bros, of San Francisco; Miss Anna
Widemann, and Mesdames H. R. Mac
farlane, Fred W. Macfarlane, C. O.
Berger, William Lanz, John M. Dow
sett and C. Conrad, who have given to
him several grandchildren.
Among the official positions held by
Mr. Widemann were Sheriff of Kauai
under King Kamehameha IV; Asso
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court;
Minister of the Interior and Minister
of Finance and acting Attorney Gen
eral under King Kalakaua and Queen
Liliuokalani; member of the House of
Nobles, both appointed by the mon
archy and again elected by popular
vote; a member of the Privy Council of
MfcAta and of the Board of Health.

Biver and Harbor Bill Considered.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â During the
entire session to-day the Senate had
under consideration the river and harbor
bill. Good progress was made, eighty
nine pages having been disposed of with
fcbo exception at one amendment.
NAVAL BILL IS
PASSED BY NOOSE
Four Days' Acrimonious
Debate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â The naval
appropriation bill finally passed the
House this afternoon after four days
of acrimonious debate, most of which
was spent upon the question of rehab
ilitating the Naval Academy at An
napolis In accordance with the scheme
inaugurated by the appropriation of
half a million in the last naval bill, and
the proposition to increase the maxi
mum price to be paid for armor plate to
5545 per ton, existing law limiting it
to $400.
Upon both propositions the Naval
Committee suffered signal defeats. The
amendment to build a great armor
plant was ruled out upon a point of
order, but after a rancorous debate, in
which the price to be paid for armor
was cut down from $545, the price
which the committee insisted was being
paid for the new Krupp armor, to $445,
and a proviso was also added preclud
ing the Government from paying more
than was paid by any other foreign
government for similar armor.
When the bill was reported to the
House Boutelle attempted to secure a
reversal of the verdicts of the commit
tee of the whole on the naval academy
and armor plate amendments, but in
both cases he was defeated, a motion
to recommit the bill made by him being
voted down, 7u to 155.
Another victory over the committee
was secured by the adoption of a pro
vision to the naval bill creating the
rank of admiral of the navy. This was
accomplished by Moody of Massachu
setts, who offered a copy of the Senate
bill creating this rank as an amend
ment to the naval bill. The amend
ment was clearly subject to the point
of order against it raised by Boutelle
but the sentiment of the House was so
apparently unanimous in favor of the
amendment that he withdrew the point
: of order and it was adopted without a
I dissenting vote. The Naval Committee
had amended the Senate bill so as to
also create the rank of vice admiral
but Moody's amendment was the orig
inal Senate bill without the provision
The House declined to consider the
Brown-Swanson contested election
case in the Fourth Virginia District by
a vote of 132 to 99. This is the second
attempt to call up this case.
GENERAL EAGAN AGAIN
DEFENDS ARMY BEEF
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2?.-The testi
mony of Colonel J. F. Weston. who was
at the outbreak of the war assistant com
rnisFary general and Is the successor of
Commissary General Eagan, together
with the appearance of Geteral Eagan
was the feature of to-day's proceedings
of the court of Inquiry Investigating the
charges of General Miles as to the beef
supply to the army while in Cuba and in
Porto Rico. Each contended that the
canned roast beef was a wholesome and
nutritious component of the army ration
! and took issue with the regular army of
| fleers who have criticized it.
Regarding the refrigerated beef, the
testimony of to-day tended to show that
it was satisfactory. General Eagan took
issue with General Miles In regard to beef
on the hoof as the best supply of fresh
beef to an army, maintaining the source
was Impracticable In Cuba, and especial
ly undesirable in any .country where the
animal heat In the beef could not disap
pear before cooking.
CANAL AMENDMENT
MAY BE SACRIFICED
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: It is probable
that the Nicaragua Canal amendment to
the river and harbor bill will be sacrificed
to insure the final passage of the pending
measure. There is small but determined
opposition to the canal amendment in the
Seiwtt:, and Senator Caffery and others
who are opposed to the canal scheme
threaten to enter" Into a prolonged discus
sion as to the propriety of engrafting
such an important .piece of international
legislation to an appropriation bill as a
rider.
If a vote could be taken in the Senate
without debate the canal amendment
would be adopted. It Is possible that even
now the Senate may go on record again
In favor of the canal, as it has done on
previous occasions. That would leave the
responsibility lor striking out the canal
amendment with the House of Represen
tatives.

And shall any one, who recalls the his
tory of the Apostles, the faith of the
nascent church, the trials and deaths of
the martyrs, and above all, those olden
times, so fruitful in saints, dare to meas
ure our age with these, or affirm that
they received less of the divine outpour
ing from the spirit of holiness? Not to
dwell upon this point, there is no one
who calls in question the truth that the
holy spirit does work by a secret descent
into the souls of the just, and that He
Btlrs them alike by warnings and im
pulses, since unless this were the case all
outward defense and authority would be
unavailing. â <*â ..â¢ i.
"For if any persuades himself that no
can give assent to saving, that is to gos
pel truth when proclaiming, without any
Illumination of the Holy Spirit, who gives
unto all sweetness both to assent and to
hold such a one is deceived by heretical
spirit." [From the second counsel of
Orange, Canon 7.] â¦Â»,-_â
Moreover.' as experience shows, these
monitions and impulses of the Holy Spirit
are for the most part felt through the
medium of the aid and light of an exter
nal teaching authority. To quote Saint
Augustine: "He (the Holy Spirit) co-ope
rates to the fruit gathered from the good
trees, since he externally waters and cul
tivates them by the outward ministry of
men. and yet of himself bestows the in
ward increase." [De Gratia Christi, chap-
This, indeed, belongs to the ordinary
law of God's loving providence that as he
has decreed that men for the most part
shall be saved by the ministry also of
men. so has he wished that those whom
he calls to the higher planes, of holiness
should be led thereto by men; hence St.
Chrysostom declared wo are taught of
God through the instrumentality of men
(Homily 1;. Of this a striking example
is given us in the very first days of the
church. For though Saul, Intent upon
blood and slaughter, had heard the voico
of our Lord himself and had asked,
"What dost thou want me to do?" let
was he bidden to enter Damascus and
search for Ananias? Acts ix: "Enter
the city and it shall be there told to thee
what thou must do."
Nor can we leave out of consideration
the truth that those who are striving
after perfection, since by that fact they
walk in no beaten or well-known path,
are the most liable to stray, and hence
have greater need than others of a teach
er and guide. Such guidance has ever
obtained in the church, it is the univer
sal teaching of those who throughout the
ages have t>een eminent for wisdom and
sanctity, and hence to reject It would be
to commit one's self to a belief at once
rash and dangerous.
A thorough consideration of this point,
in the supposition that no exterior guide
Is granted such souls, will make us see
the difficulty of locating or determining
the direction and application of that most j
abundant influx of the Holy Spirit so :
greatly extolled by innovators. To prac
tice virtue there is absolute need of the
assistance of the Holy Spirit, yet we find
those who are fond of novelty giving an
unwarranted importance to the natural j
virtues, as they better responded to the
customs and necessities of the times, and
that having these as his outfit man be
comes both more ready to act and more j
strenuous in action. It is not easy to j
understand haw persons possessed of
Christian wisdom can either prefer natu
ral or supernatural virtues or attribute
to them a greater efficacy and fruitful
ness Can It be that nature conjoined j
with grace is wearier than when left to
herself?
Can It be that those men illustrious for
sanctity, whom the church distinguishes :
and openly pays homage to, were defl- i
cient. came short, in the order of nature
and its endowments because they excelled
in Christian strength? And although It .
be allowed at times to wonder at actsi
worthy of admiration which are the out
come of natural virtueâ is there any one
at all endowed simply with an outfit of <
natural virtue? Is there any one not tried i
by mental anxiety, and this in no light
degree* Yet ever to master such, as also
to preserve in its entirety the law of i
the natural order, requires an assistance j
from on high. These single notable acts!
to which we have alluded^ will frequently
upon a close investigation be found to ]
pvhihit "the appearance rather than the
reality of virtue. Grant that it is virtue j
unless we would "run in vain 1 and be ,
unmindful of that, eternal bliss which a ;
good God in his mercy destined for us, i
of what avail are natural virtues unless
seconded by the gift of divine grace? j

make disavowal for the conduct of her
agents, there is no doubt that the
wishes of the Berlin Government would
be consulted with respect to Chief Jus
tice Chambers. But so far as that offi
cial's decision is concerned it will be
upheld unless the department should
receive reports very different from
those in its possession.
There has befen no important new de
velopment in the Samoan situation for
some days, nor do the authorities ex
pect any until the arrival of the next
mail from Apia. It is then expected
that they will learn that the Philadel
phia has reached Samoa and that Rear
Admiral Kautz is co-operating with the
Consuls in preserving peace, and mak
ing an investigation of the conduct of
several officers in Apia. Germany and
England, like the United States, are
not at all excited over the situation,
and the officials assert their confidence
that the affair will be terminated
peacefully and satisfactorily.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Feb. 23.âAus
tralian papers which arrived here to
day on the steamer Miowera print the
following letter from Chief Justice
Chambers of Samoa to Captain Sturdy
of H. M. S. Porpoise, who took a prom
inent part in the recent' trouble in
Samoa:
Nothing that you have done since the
events in Samoa brought us so close to
gether has been a surprise to us. They
were simply acts of a noble-minded man
and an English gentleman. To me, with
my eves open to it all. it has been a mar
vel that in the midst of the whirlwind
of events requiring patience, skill and
courage you have been able to command
the situation In all its bearings so per
fectly. If the officers and men of the
Porpoise are a sample of the English
navy, then I want to be a convert to the
principles of Anglo-Saxon alliance, not
from motives of policy, but because I see
that behind the power of your ships there
is a stronger moral power for the uplift
ing of the human race. We are fixed in
our faith that the English-American al
liance is an expression of human freedom,
unusual prosperity and the ultimate po
litical millennium throughout the world.

Post, Quoting General Shatter as having
Continued from First Page.
nature of man, owing to {he primal fault,
is inclined to evil and dishonor, yet by
the help of grace is raised up, is borne
along with a new greatness and strength,
so, too, virtue, which is not the- proauct
of nature alone, but of grace also, is made
fruitful unto everlasting life and takes
on a more strong and abiding character.
This overesteem of natural virtue finds
a method of expression in assuming to
divide all virtues into active and passive,
and it is alleged that whereas passive
virtues found better place in past times,
our age is to be characterized by the ac
tive. That such a division and distinction
cannot be maintained is patentâ for there
is not nor can there be merely passive
virtue. "Virtue," says St. Thomas
Aquinas, "designates the perfection of
some faculty, but the end or such faculty
is an act, and an act of virtue is naught
else than the good use of frae will," act
ing, that is to say, under the grace of
God if the act be one of supernatural
virtue.
He alone could wish that some Chris
tian virtues be adapted to certain times
and different ones for other times who Is
unmindful of the apostle's word "that
those whom he foreknew he predestined
to be made conformable to the image of
his Son" (Romans. viii:2s). Christ Is the
teacher and the exemplar of all sanctity
and to his standard must all those con
form who wish for eternal life. Nor does
Christ know any change as the ages pass,
"for he is yesterday and to-day and the
same forever" (Hebrews, xlli:8). To the
men of all ages was the precept given.
"Learn of me, because I am meek and
humble of heart" (Matthew, xi:29).
To every age has he been made mani
fest-to us as obedient even unto death;
in every age the apostles' dictum has its
force, "Those who are Christ's have
crucified their flesh with its vices and
concupiscences." Would to God that
more nowadays practiced these virtues in
the degree of the saints of past times,
who in humility, obedience and self
restraint were powerful "in word and in
deed"â to the great advantage not only
of religion but of the state and the pub
lic welfare.
From this disregard of the evangelical
virtues, erroneously styled "passive," the
step was a short one to a contempt of the
religious life which has in some degree
taken hold of minds. That such a value
Is generally held by the upholders of new
views we infer from certain statements
concerning the vows which religious or
ders take. They say vows are alien to
the spirit of our times, in that they limit
the bounds of human liberty; that they
are more suitable to weak that to strong
minds; that so far from making for hu
man perfection and the good of human
organization they are hurtful to both, but
that this is as false as possible from the
practice and doctrine of the church is
clear, since she has always given the
very highest approval to the religious
method of life; not without good cause,
for those who under the divine call have
freely embraced that state of life did not
content themselves with the observance
of precepts, but, going farward to the
evangelical councils, showed themselves
ready and valiant soldiers of Christ.
Shall we Judge this to be acharacteriÃtic
of weak minds or shall we say that it is
useless or hurtful to a more perfect state
of life? ThoÃe who so bind themselves by
the vows of religion, far from having suf
fered a loss of liberty, enjoy that fuller
and freer kind, that liberty, namely, by
which Christ hath made us free. And
this further view of theirs, namely, that
the religious life is either useles or of lit
tle service to the church, besides being in
jurious to the religious orders, cannot be
the opinion of any one who has read the
annals of the church. Did not your coun
try, the United States, derive the begin- I
nings both of faith and of culture from
the children of those religious families?
To one of whom but very lately, a thing ,

TACOMA BOYS
SHOOT INDIANS
Volleys Fired at Inoffensive Red
skins and an Aged Warrior
Is Wounded.
Â© TACOMA, Feb. 23.â Tacoma boys are not satisfied with the old- O
O fashioned sport of throwing stonos at frogs. It is much more gamy O
O sport to shoot real bullets at Indians. At least one group of juvenile O
O hunters has come to this conclusion. Yesterday afternoon they fired O
O several charges at a group of harmless Indians camped on the shores O
O of Puget Sound. Â©
O The Indians were greatly frightened, particularly the squaws and O
O children. Charley Sheadshort, an aged Indian, was shot in the back O
O of the neck. The ball missed his brain by only a few inches. Though O
O not fatally injured he will be laid up for a long time and will carry O
O the scar of the wound to his dying day. The boys were out shooting O
Â© ducks. They apparently thought it would be perfectly proper to take O
O a few shots at Indians and their families as they were eating their O
O dinner about a fire on the farther shore of Commeucement Bay. Sev- O
Â© eral shots were fired. All went very near the Indians, most of whom O
Â© then heard bullets whizzing by their ears for the first time in their O
Â© lives. One of the last shots hit old Charley squarely in the neck as O
O he turned his head to see where the previous bullets were striking. The O
Â© boys fired at a distance of 400 yards. After Charley was shot they O
O ran away. &
Q The injured Indian was placed in a canoe and taken to his home O
Â© on Puyallup reservation as speedily as possible. Ex-Chief Jackson Â©
Â© of Puyallup learned who the boys were and a? warrant for their ar- Â©
O rest has been sworn out in King County, where the shooting oc- Â©
Â© curred. Old Charley is a veteran of the Indian war of 1855, in which O
Â© he was shot through the face, taking out his teeth, from which he O
Â© acquired the nickname of "Shotmouth Charley." He would not now O
Â© prosecute the boys who made the attack on him only that he says O
Â© if it had been one of his children that had been hit instead of him- O
O self the child would have been killed. . O

QOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOQ
surely to all who do not forget that the
"continual prayer of the Just" avails to
placate and to bring down th"c blessings
of heaven when to such prayers bodily
mortification is added.
But :f there be those who. prefer to form
one body without the obligation of the
vows, let them pursue such a course. It
is not new in the church nor in any wise
censurable. Let them be careful, how
ever, not to set forth such a state above
that of religious orders. But rather, since
mankind is more- disposed at the present
time to indulge itself in pleasures,- let
those be held in greater esteem, "who,
having left all things, have followed
Christ."
Finally, not to delay too long, it is
stated that the way and method hitherto
in use among Catholics for bringing back
those who have fallen away from the
church, should be left aside and another
one chosen, in which matter it will suffice
to note that it is not the part of pru
dence to neglect that which antiquity in
its long experience has approved and
which is also taught by Apostolic author
ity. The Scriptures teach us that it is
fhe duty of all to be solicitous for the
salvation of one's neighbor, according to
the power and position of each.
The faithful do this by religiously dis
charging the duties of their state of life,
by the uprightness of their conduct, by
their works of Christian charity and by
earnest and continuous prayer to God.
On the other hand, those who belong to
the clergy should do this by an enlight
ened fulfillment of their preaching min
istry, by the pomp and splendor of cere
monies and especially by setting forth
that sound form of doctrines which St.
Paul inculcated tipon Titus and Timothy.
But if, amonfr the different ways of
preaching the^yord of God that one some
times seems to be preferable which is di
rected to non-Catholics, not in churches,
but in some suitable place, in such wise
that controversy is not sought, but friend
ly conference, such a method is certainly
without fault. But let those who under
take such ministry be set apart by the
authority of the Bishops and let them be
men whose science and virtue have been
previously ascertained. For we think that
there are many In your country who are
separated from Catholic truth by igno
rance rather than by ill will, who might
perchance more easily be drawn to the
one fold of Christ if this truth be set forth
to them in a friendly and familiar way.
From the foregoing it is manifest, be
loved son, that we are not able to give ap
proval to those views which, in their
collective sense, are called by some
"Americanism." But If by this name are
to be understood certain endowments of
mind which belong to the American peo
ple, just as other characteristics belong
to various other nations, and if, more
over, by it is designated your political
condition and the laws and customs by
which you are governed, there is no reason
to take exception to the name. But if
this Is to be understood that the doc
trines which have been adverted to above
are not only indicated, buf exalted, there
can be no manner of doubt that our ven
erable brethren, the Bishops of America,
would be the first to repudiate and con
demn it as being most injurious to them
selves and to their country. For it would
give*rise to the suspicion that there are
among us some who conceive and would
have the church in America to be differ
ent than what it is in the rest of the
world. But the true church is one as by
unity of doctrine, so by unity of gov
ernment, and she is Catholic also.
Since God has placed the center and
foundation of unity in the chair of
blessed Peter, she is rightly called the
Roman church, for "where Peter is there
is the church." Wherefore, if anybody
wl.shes to be considered a real Catholic he
ought to be able to say from his heart
the self-same words which Jeromo ad
dressed to Pope Damasus: "I, acknowl
edging no other leader than Chri3t, am
bound in fellowship with your holiness;
that is. with the chair of Peter. 1 know
that the church was built upon him as its
rock, and that whosoever gathereth not
with you scattereth."
We have thought It beliltinfr, beloved
son, in view of your office, that this let
ter should be addressed specially to you.
It will also be our care to see that copies
are sent to the bishops of the united
States, testifying again that love by
which we embrace your whole country,
a country which in past times has done
so much for the cause of rel'.ijion and
which will by the divine" assistance con
tinue to do still greater things. To you,
and to all the faithful of America, we
grant most lovingly, as a pledge of divine
assistance, our apostolic bened'cdon.

UNCERTAINTY AS
TO WHEN ALGER
WILL STEP OUT
But That He Must Retire VolÂ»
untarily or by Request Is
Now Certain.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The prospect of Secretary Alger's re
tirement from the Cabinet has been the
subject of much favorable comment in
all circles here to-day. That President
McKinley must wash his hands of Al
gerism before entering the next Presi
dential campaign has been generally
conceded for some time by his intimate
political advisers, but just hmv and
when the change in the head of the
War Department will be effected have
been problems.
There is still some uncertainty as to
the exact date when the change will
come. That Secretary Alger must re-.
tire, either voluntarily or by request,
as stated in the Herald this morning is
certain. The President would prefer
to allow Mr. Alger to retire voluntarily
and as gracefully as possible. Any ex
cuse that he might offer as to his rea
sons for resigning will be entirely ac
ceptable. Rather than have an open
ruDture the President would be inclined
to encourage rather than discourage

SAYS MOLINEUX
SENT THE POISON
Harry Cornish Makes
the Charge.
Â» Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â Harry Corn
ish, on the witness Etand at the Adams
inquest to-day, accused Roland B.
Molineux of having sent him the
poisoned bromo-seltser. His story was
that he thought Molineux had sent him
the poison because he was the only man
who had shown great enmity toward
him; that he had lied about him and
persecuted him; that he had lied about
others in the club; that there was
enmity between Barnet and Molineux,
and that Molineux had started stories
about members of the Knickerbocker
Athletic Club.
The witness stated that Molineux,
being in a rival club, was jealous of
him. He declared that the Coroner
must search the athletic clubs of New
York City for the murderer of Mrs.
Adams. He suspected Molineux of
having sent Kutnow powders to Bar
net. He testified that Mrs. Molineux's
statement that she had never been in
Barnet's room alone was false. He
knew of a person wha had seen Mrs.
Molineux and Barnet drinking wine in
the latter's room when no other person
was present.
Witness stated that Molineux was
his bitter enemy and the only man who
could have a motive for wishing to take
his life. Cornish was very earnest ih
testifying and contradicted much he
said when he was first examined by
the Coroner.
Cornish was asked several times to
give the names of the men who had told
the stories that he repeated about
Molineux. He said that he could not
remember them all, but had no doubt
these men would come forward and
substantiate his story as soon as they
heard he had told it.

CRABB SMILES
ON THE WOMEN
Pleased by the Rush of
the Fair Sex.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 23.â Mrs. Hattia
Crabb resumed the story of her marital
troubles in Judge Kittredge's court thla
morning before an increased audience.
The fair sex were in the majority, and
they occupied all the front seats. Nevej
did a divorce suit attract such atten
tion in this city. Dr. Crabb seems to
like the presence of so many ladies,
and frequently turns and smiles on
them.
Mrs. Crabb's testimony showed she
had been hustled off to Dr. Robinson's
private asylum at Livermore with the
understanding that she was going to
a sanitarium. She remained thera
about three months. From there she
went to San Francisco. On April 27
last, Dr. Crabb and Deputy Sheriff
Gardner called and brought her to San
Jose. Here she was examined by Drs.
Caldwell and Curnow and committed
to the Agnewa Asylum.
Mrs. Crabb"s story of the examina
tion shows it was a one-sided affair,
and she was given no chance to dis
prove the charge. As to the ridiculous
ness of some of the' testimony against
her, Mrs. Garrett had testified that the
witness had claimed she saw two
snakes in the woodshed and also a
mouse. Mrs. Crabb said this was true.
She had been refused a jury to decide
on her insanity.
Once or twice the attorneys drifted
off and discussed Crabb's poetry. Has
sett asked if Dr. Crabb had ever told
witness that Esther, to whom he dedi
cated the opening poem in his book,
referred in any way to Miss Perry, the
choir girl. She answered he did. and
had told her Miss Perry's neck and
ears were like those of Esther. Tha
court interrupted this side play.
Witness underwent a rigid cross-ex
amination at the hands of Attorney
Burchard. Mrs. Crabb said she never
believed her husband guilty of adul
tery and did not wish to be understood
as making such a charge. She denied
ever having assaulted him with a
razor, and the only time she ever used
a razor at the University of the Pa
cific was to pare her corns.
Mrs. Crabb told of .her husband's
fondness for Mrs. Osborne,-Mlss Perry
and Miss Mayne. The doctor had de
clared "they all lovt<3 with all the
power of being." At the same time he
declared all their words and acts were
chaste and pure.
A portion of the written confession
of .Dr. Crabb's love for Miss Perry
was introduced, and the court took ad
mission under consideration.
Dr. Crabb then identified a number
of letters his wife had written him.

PLAY THEIR LAST
CARD AND LOSE
Leaders Harangue and Urge Troops to
March to the Elysee and Save France,
But Only Succeed in Getting
Arrested.
PARIS, Feb. 23.â Have the anti-Drey- I
fupards played their last card?
M. Paul Deroulede to-day made an
effort to suborn the army and signally
failed. He is now biting his nails in i
Rivoli barracks with a call at the depot
awaiting an exit and trial before the
Haute Court in prospect. MM. Habert
and Mlllevoye were also arrested. The
Figaro gives the following version:
"At 5 o'clock M. Deroulede was at the
head of the Ligue dcs Patriots and the
Semitic committees in the Place of
Nations, when General Roget, formerly
;M. Cavaignac's Chief of Cabinet, re
turned from the Faure funeral at the
head of a brigade of infantry. The
league cheered M. Deroulede, and MM.
Marcel and Habert placed themselves
beside the general, who shook hands
with M. Deroulede, who is an old friend.
"M. Deroulede exclaimed: 'I hope
you will march to the Elysee. France
is with you. You must save the un
happy country. The league is with
you.' '
â¢The general did not reply, but con
tinued to march along the Boulevard
de Diderot, followed by M. Deroulede
and patriots, who perhaps thought of
going to the Elysee via the quays.
"At Rue Kivoli they were disillu
sioned. The troops went up to the
barracks. The league stopped, while
M. Deroulede and M. Habert followed
into the barracks and harangued the
soldiers, repeating: "Save us from
anarchy and Dreyfusards. A general
\vho will save the country will deserve
well of France.'
"The general replied: 'Go out or I will
close the gates on you as prisoners.'
" 'All right, we are your prisoners
arid remain with you.' The gates were
then closed."
In another version M. Deroulede
merely followed General Roget into the
barracks and on his refusal to go out
Mas detained with M. Habert.
According to the" first reports from
tho Prefecture of Police, the Ligue dcs
Patriots, which had rendezvous in the
Place de la Republique at 3 o'clock.
and when prevented from assembling
went to the Place de la Bastile, again
met the police. The league marched to
the Place ties Nations, deaded by MM.
I leroulede, Habert, Casies and Mille
voye and Comte d'Aulan. Then find
ing it impossible to " reach the ceme
tery in time, they abandoned the plan. ;
At fi o'clock tho regiments under Gen- j
eral Roget passed with much cheer- I
ing. MM. Deroulede and Habert fol- !
lowed the troops into the barracks and
. refused to go out when told by the
general and colonel, who urged them
to withdraw.
"We c^mc here In the sanctuary of
the French army to shout 'Vive
Prancje! 1 'Vive I'Armee!' and will only i
Â£<â¢> when forced by the police."
The colonel tried again. It was use-
Ipsp. and he took them into a room and
telephoned to the Military Governor,
who informed the Prefect of Police.
The Prefect replied: "Since they want ;
to stop, leave them till they are tired j
and gn away."
The Figaro says this is a most prob
ahle version.

PARIS. Feb. 23.â Agents In this city of
the Filipinos have received news from
NO FOREIGN TROOPS
TO LAND AT MANILA
The Military Authorities of the
United States Can Handle the
Situation There All Right.
CALL OFFICE. RIGGS HOUSE, "WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. â The
grave situation at Manila has impressed upon both parties to the con
troversy over the army bill the necessity of putting an end to party dis
agreements in the face of the present emergency, leaving their differ
ences to be settled in the future.
Thp popular assumption that immediately upon the ratification of the
peace treaty with Spain by the Cortes hostilities between the two coun
tries will be ended is erroneous.. Technically, hostilities will continue
until the commission, yet to be appointed by the United States and Spain,
meets in Washington and makes formal ratification and exchange of
agreement between the two countries. This will probably take from
four to six weeks after the Cortes has acted, and therefore the conditions
which admit of the retention of the present military establishment will
continue until that time.
The situation in Manila admits of the possibility of foreign compli
cations on account of the destruction of the property of foreigners
within our lines, and it might be that some foreign government would
propose to land forces to protect the property of its citizens; but it is
not believed that this will occur.
Officials of the administration do not attach any importance to the
suggestion that the uprising may lead to interference on the part of
other governments. It was feared by some people that the partly suc
cessful attempt to burn the city might give rise to the impression among
foreign nations that the United States was not in complete control of
the city of Manila, and not able to fully protect its own or foreign in
terests there. If such were the case, it might possibly justify other gov
ernments in taking steps to safeguard the lives and property of their
subjects in that vicinity, and to that extent to interfere with the ad
ministration of affairs by the United States military authorities. The
officials hold, however, that there is no proper basis for iuch an as
sumption, and freely assert that no government would attempt to take
any such advantage of the situation.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1899.
The members of the Russian mission
were loudly cheered. Following the for
eign missions came the members of the
Senate and Chamber of Deputies and >
other delegations from the army and |
navy, etc., the Council of State, the j
Judges of the Courts of Cassation and j
Appeal, and deputations from other pub- I
lie bodies. The procession was preceded
by detachments of cavalry, infantry, ma- j
rines and cadets from the School of St. J
Cyr and the Polytechnic, while strong
bodies of troops were interspersed
throughout the funeral cortege. The I
whole route was lined with troops of all j
arms and was also guarded by police.
The procession proceeded slowly toward
j the cathedral, the crowds reverently
! standing with bared heads as it passed.
The people in the crowds doffed their
hats respectfully . to President Loubet,
who saluted the flags of the regiments
lining the route. When the procession I
emerged upon the. Qua! de la Megisserie, I
i fronting part of the lie de la Cite, the
| bells of Notre Dame began to toll, and
when, the cortege reached the. square in !
| front of the cathedral, otherwise the j
Place dv Parvis Notre Dame, the bells i
burst Into a funeral peal, the troops pre- i
senting arms as the casket was taken
into the cathedral.
The catafalque in the cathedral was an
! immense structure in the center of the
transept. It was over seventy feet high j
and was surmounted by an imposing can- j
opy to the height of 130 feet, from the j
four corners of which huge black palls, |
I covered with silver stars bordered with !
ermine, were stretched the four pillars I
i and to the transept. Upon the steps of j
1 the catafalque were twenty lamps, each i
| with thirty lights, twenty immense !
; torches and liVi large tapers, giving the ]
I catafalque a most impressive appearance.
The ceremony at the cathedral was most
i solemn and impressive. The facade of the
! building was enveloped with sable drap
i fry.
Cardinal Richard, the Archbishop of
Paris. Warmg 1 a crucifix, awaited Presi- j
dent Loubet. offered him holy water and
then conducted him processionally to a i
front seat in the choir.
The casket was received at the door
! of the cathedral by the archprlest and the i
' clergy of the parish, and was borne to a ,
i catafalque in the center of the building. !
> The cathedral was draped as in the case !
-, of the funeral of President Carnot, black j
i hangings with silver stars and borders [
; and trophies of trl-color flags veiled with j
1 crepe.
Cardinal Richard sat facing President
Louhet and the choir was filled with arch
bishops, bishops and other prelates. Low
i mass was celebrated. The chanting and
j music W"=-re impressive in their effect.
Cardinal Richard th^n approached the
casket, which was guarded by officers and
1 surrounded by the clergy, and pronounced
: the absolution to the strains or the organ
I and the peal of the cathedral bells.
The casket was then borne to the portal, j
| accompanied by the clergy, and replaced (
: on the funeral car, after which the pro
, cession wended its way to the cemetery }
of Pere la chaise, where it arrived at 3:
j o'clock. The gates and walls of the.ceme
i tery were draped with black and silver,
! in the manner adopted at the cathedral,
I the palace and at other places. The
I wreaths were deposited at the foot of the
, wall and the casket was laid on a cata
falque at the entrance to fhe cemetery.
Eulogistic speeches were delivered by
Senator Chauveau and MM. Deschanel,
Dupuy, Lookroy and Gulllan.
The troops present then defiled before
; the catafalque. There was no disorder
i anywhere. The crowds were calm and
respectful. The police arrangements
! throughout were admirable.
President Loubet, who. it must be con
fessed, is unpopular, made many friends
to-day by his resolute bearing. He
! trudged the whole weary way to the cem- ,
â  etery, -and commendations of his bravery j
were heard on all sides.
During the day requiem masses for the
repose of the soul of the late President
I we re said everywhere throughout the
i provinces.
Ip to 6 o'clock this evening everything
'â  has been quiet, with the exception of oc- I
I casional cries from various factions
i thronging the streets.
At 6:30 p. m. a crowd of people assem
bled in front of the office of the Libre
! Parole and started shouting " Panama,"
i and "Down with Loubet." Several of
these persons were promptly arrested and I

there was not the work of the natives,
but was started by the American shells.
When the attack commenced the Filipinos
and the foreign residents were endeavor
ing to persuade General Lopez, the Fil
ipino commander, to submit, as Hollo was
.not fortified and was, therefore, not in a
position to resist the American attack.
The whole commercial quarter at Hollo,
it aopears, was destroyed, with four
fifths of the rest of the town. Finally,
the Filipinos say, the foreign residents
subseauently met, protested against the
bombardment and resolved to put in
claims for damages.
THE PRESIDENT
GETS AN ARMY
Agrees to Compromise
on Hull Bill.
NO EXTRA SESSION NOW
QUESTION TO COME UP IN
NEXT CAMPAIGN.
In the Meantime It Will Be Per
mitted to Enlist Troops
in the New Colo
nies.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: President McKinley has
so far yielded to the opponents of the
Hull-Hawley army increase bill as to
indicate his willingness to accept a
compromise measure that will have the
effect of giving him as a temporary
force practically the same organization
proposed by tse original Hull bill. It
is proposed that the increased force
shall be continued until July 1, 1901,
which will carry it over the next Presi
dential campaign and will admit of the
question of whether the temporary
army shall be made permanent being
made one of the issues of that cam
paign.
The Democratic leaders in the Senate
have agreed to the general principle
of the proposed compromise and the
form which the new bill will take will
be finally decided at the meeting of the
Military Committee to-morrow. The
proposition that will probably be adopt
ed is to continue the present strength
of the regular army, bl',ooo men, until
July 1, 1901, and provide for an ad
ditional force of 35,000 men to be en
listed either in the United States or in
the colonies, and to be kept distinct
from the present regular force.
The agreement for a compromise
army bill of course relieves practically
every danger of an extra session of
Congress. The Senate still has a great
deal of work to do on the appropriation
bills, but the situation so far as these
bills is concerned is not worse than
usual at the end of the short session
of Congress and there is now every rea
son to believe that the compromise
army bill and all the appropriation bills
will be passed before the end of the
session at noon on March 4.
Before the basis of the compromise
was agreed to an effort was made by
the Republicans to induce the Demo
crats to accept the Hull bill, with the
understanding that not less than two
of the additional brigadier generals
provided for would be. Democrats. It
was proposed that Joseph Wheeler and
Fitzhugh Lee be named as the Demo
crats and J. 11. Wilson and Leonard
Wood as the Republicans. The Demo
crats refused to agree to this.
GROSS IGNORANCE
OF THE FILIPINOS
The Kind of Ignorance the Soldier
Boys Are Fighting With
Bine Balls.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
MANILA, Jan. 20.â Education amnng
the Filipinos is extremely backward. The
few who have any education at all either
acquired it from prejudiced or meager
sources, for the little knowledge they
possess concerning the world outside the
Philippines is so distorted that it Is gro
tesque. Even Aguinaldo and his advisers
are not exempt from the common misln- :
formation. American occupation so far
has done scarcely nothing to enlighten
them. They are set in their convictions,
are naturally proud, are suspicious of all i
white races and it Is going to he a tedious j
and difficult undertaking to remove their
misinformation and the prejudices of gen
erations.
The only schools in all the Philippine |
group are confined to the city of Manila.
There are net more than ten for the edu
cation of the natives, and they are con
ducted by the Catholic church. All of
them but one are primary schools, where
nothing higher is taught than reading,
writing and elementary arithmetic, com
bined with religious instruction. The sin
gle high school includes branches corre
sponding with those of the average third
grade public school in the United States.
The English residents of the city maintain
a very good school for their own children,
as the Germans do also. But the educa
tional efforts of the Spaniards seem to
have been restricted to imparting the
least possible information with the most
possible prejudice and superstition.
As an illustration of Philippine enlight
enment, the common idea of the world's
geography is a good example. Every
Filipino who knows anything about other
parts of the world than his native prov
ince or village will readily tell you that
China has the largest area of territory
and the greatest number of inhabitants
of any nation in the world. It is so large
that it cannot be measured and contain*
so many people that they cannot be
counted. France and Spain are next to
China in the extent of their territory,
but incomparably superior to China in re
finement, education, wealth and religion.
Close by the side of France and Spain
stands Italy, the home of the Great
Father, who alone of all men can commu
nicate directly with God.
Germany is a country north of France
and Italy, and is inhabited by the de
scendants of men who but a few genera
tions ago made their home with wild
beasts. The size of Germany is unimpor
tant, as the Germans are not a very re
fined people. They go to France and Italy
for instruction in music, art. language
and astronomy, and a majority of them
are cursed with a false religion. England
is a very small nation, but on account of
its favorable climate, rich bankers make
it their home. Those rich bankers have
had many powerful warships built for
their own protection. They hire seamen to
run the ships for them.
The United States resembles China in
extent of territory, but is small enough
to be measured. The Americans in part
are the descendants of adventurous Euro
peans who came over years ago and
found inexhaustible mines of gold. Those
gold mines have made America one of the
richest countries in the world, and all
white Americans have more money than
they know what to do with. The early
immigrants from Europe intermarried
with the native Indians, then brought
millions of negroes from somewhere to do
their work for them and gradually mixed
with the negroes also. The result is that
the great bulk of Americans are a mix
ture of European, negro and Indian blood.
The few whites in the United btates are
very well educated because they possess
wealth to obtain gdod educations in
France and Italy. Most of the Ameri
cans however, are illiterate and poor,
naving but recently emerged from slav
ery Â£ike the English, the Americans are
devoted to a false religion, except a few
who have been favored with special ad
vnntaKesin education. The white Ameri
cans ire good fighters, but there are so
few of them that they have their hands
lull most of the time in suppressing in
surrections among the mi ions of negroes
and mixed breeds as wel as in keeping
the Indians out of the cities.
Schools for Filipinos are held in rooms
attached to churches. Seats and benches
are not provided as in American schools,
but the pupils sit on their feet on the
floor. All study aloud, and in conse
quence the school room is a bedlam of con
fusion. No school is permitted to have
more than eightly pupils on its rolls at
one time. That is a regulation of the
church. Just why it is so cannot be as
certained by Americans. Various ex
cuses are given, the most common being

PEAT FIRES RAGE
ON ISLAND SLOUGH
Many Large Patches of Ground Ablaze and
the Flood Gate of the Levee Will
Be Opened.
STOCKTON Feb. 23.â The burning of a pumping plant belonging
to Reclamation District No. 548. at the mouth of Island Slough, has
set the peat land of the reclaimed island on fire. Sparks from the
hot blaze set flre to the peat ground in various places. A report
from^Terminu 3 to-day says that the ground is still burning in patches

spots thus burned. It was said that the flre in the ground was un
der control and would be extinguished in three days.
In flghtlng peat fireg trenches are dug around the burning spot
flown to the water. When the flre reaches the trench it b\arns out.
ThVre are so many spots ablaze now at Island Slough, however, that
it is hardly likely the trench diggers could work fast enough in this
way and the probability is the flood gate in the levee will be opened

THE HAWAIIAN FLAG
REGISTRY QUESTION
HONOLULU. Feb. IB.â The Hawaiian
registry question has assumed a most
serious commercial aspect. The Willscott
finished discharging her cargo on the Bth
inst and Colonel Macfarlane, her owner,
immediately notified the charterers,
Castle & Cook, in accordance with the
charter party, that she would be ready
to receive sugar for -stiffening the next
morning. Castle & Cooke replied that
until the question of registration was set
tled they must decline to load sugar on
h Colonel Macfarlane was In consultation
V.?' u v, attorney, L. M. Thurston. on the
Object this afternoon. Speaking of it he
Sa ''-The nuestion of ownership has been
raised in the courts. The Willscott came
into San Francisco and was sold at auc
tion on account of the underwriters. She
was bought for $35,000, a bargain, for the
Express purpose of putting her in the
Â«uear trade either between here and San
FtanciÃco or here and the Atlantic. Tem
porary Hawaiian registry was secured on
July 28 to bring her here to her home port
for permanent register. I have the bill or
sale for her. Her charter is nearly a
$20 000 charter. Now by the delay in giv
ing her registry that is put in jeopardy.
"It is not merely a question of whether
she could enter the port of New York
without a flag. She would not now be
taken for a pirate, as she would in the old
days, but she could not clear from toere
with a cargo of sugar without a registry,
even if the charterers were willing to take
the risk of entering her in New York. To
go back to the British flag is not what
we want, for we bought her to go into the
sugar trade, where vessels are needed.
Thus the commercial aspect is a serious
one And the question of damages be
comes important. Will the local govern
ment or Federal government be liable for
it?
"Another serious question arises. If
she goes out in the stream without stiff
ening and a gale should come up, who
would answer for the damage? Mr. Kln
ney telegraphs from Washington that if
the question of registry had never been
raised here it never would have been
raised in Washington."

SPEAK OUT FOR THE CANAL.
NOW is the time for State Legislatures, Cham
bers of Commerce, Boards of Trade, labor or
ganizations and all other representatives of
public sentiment to speak for the Nicaragua canal.
The speech, moreover, should be prompt and em
phatic. It should be terse and vigorous and ring
with something like the voice of the whole people.
The supporters and the opponents of the measure
in Congress have joined in what promises to be a
tight to a finish. After it was found impossible to
get a hearing for the bill separately an attempt was
made by its friends to attach it to the sundry civil
bill, but that move was defeated. Now the Senate
has attached it to the river and harbor appropriation
bill and once more the battle is to be waged in the
House. At such a juncture it is surely timely for
the voice of the nation to make itself heard.
The opponents of the great enterprise are already
boasting that the bill is virtually defeated. Upon the
failure of the attempt to annex it to the sundry civil
bill, the Baltimore American said: "The Nicaragua
canal scheme has been defeated in the present Con
gress and the time for reflection allowed before
another Congress assembles may be depended on to
defeat it altogether."
Such are the tactics of those who are antagonistic
to the canal. They are convinced if they can defeat
the measure now, while the lessons of the war show
ing its importance are fresh in the public mind, it will
be comparatively easy to set it aside altogether here
after. It is not to be denied there is some basis for
the conviction. Defeat of the measure in this Con
gress will presage a similar disaster in the next. The
time, therefore, has come when all the friends of the
measure should declare themselves and back up their
representatives who are battling for it in Congress.
If anything is to be done, however, either by the
Legislature, by commercial and industrial organiza
tions, or by a mass meeting of citizens, it must be
clone promptly. Congress closes on the 4th of March,
and that time is near at hand. Whatever may be
done or left undone elsewhere. California should
make her voice heard urging her Senators and her
Representatives +0 make the fight for the canal by
every honorable means at their command.
PUT ON THE BRAKES.
THE weekly report of the Committee on Ways
and .Means, submitted to the Assembly on Mon
day, shows that the total amount of appropria
â¢ tions. exclusive of those necessary for the current ex
penses of the government, which have been intro
duced into the Legislature and referred to it, amount
to $3,68&8 2 & Oi this the committee has reported
back with a favorable recommendation bills carrying
.:..$!, 507.806. Bills carrying $348,626 have been reported
â  adversely, bills carrying $1,115,500 have been reported
â¢ without recommendation, bills carrying $408,845 have
been referred to other committees â from which they
will probably emerge by and by with a favorable re
port â and appropriations amounting to $496,542 have
-been reported with a recommendation that the authors
. be" allowed to withdraw them, which they will prob
ably not do.
As a financial exhibit this report presents an object
.'lesson which the taxpayers of the State should
eagerly study at the present time. Just as the people
are recovering from a dry year, which has come very
near throwing most of them into bankruptcy, the
legislative schemers propose to shovel out their
. ' money in this way with a wild and reckless hand.
It will be noticed that the Ways and Means Com
mittee has sent back to the Assembly bills carrying
appropriations amounting to $2,600,000. Of these
over half have been favorably reported. The other
half, though returned without recommendation, are
in almost as strong a position before the Assembly.
â¢Undoubtedly it is the intention of the Committee on
"Ways and Means to allow this raid to be consum
mated. Xo other construction can be placed upon
its action. The general appropriation bill will prob
! ably carry for the fiscal years 1899-1900 and 1900-1
.'Si 0.000,000, and unless a check is placed upon the
'. Legislature within the next two weeks taxation for
the ensuing year at least will rise above 65 cents on
â¢ the $100 valuation.
If this Legislature desires to destroy the Repub
lican party it should pass these bills and elect Dan
â  Burns Senator. A more effective way of committing
. political hara-kiri could scarcely be devised.
.Last year there were four cases of murder in Can
.â¢ ada, while there is more than one city in the United
'â¢States which, if not furnishing four murders weekly,
would fall below the record. Here is both food for
thought and incentive for the hangman.
The Filipinos do not exhibit satisfactory symptoms
of being awed.
PfJRTY VINDICATION.
THE cry of the Burns workers that he must be
vindicated by election to the Senate is the mak
ing of a new issue in politics and the discovery
cf a new use for parties. All that has been said
against Burns is derived from his own record. He
made that record. No one made it for him. It is
no libel to publish i(, when its publication was made
necessary by his candidacy for the highest honor the
party can bestow. It is surely something novel in
morals, politics and party practice for a man to
make an odious record in public office, and then de
mand of the party vindication from the publication
of that record!
If party rewards are to be had that way, the be
trayal of one public trust becomes a necessary step
ping stone to the achievement of a greater trust.
It is the misfortune of Burns that his record as Sec
retary of State was so bad that to publish it is to
present the highest reason against conferring the
promotion now sought by his ambition. It is a mis- j
take for him to assume that his election to the Senate
By the Legislature will vindicate him against that j
record. There are other things to think of besides j
such vindication of Burns. The interests of the
party are to be considered. If it take the means pro- ,
posed to vindicate Burns, how shall it be vindicated?
If Burns go to the Senate on a candidacy concealed
until after power had passed from the people at the j
ballot-box he will be safe for six years. He will not I
have to go before the people at all. Â»But the party j
must go to the people again next year. It must stand
the brunt, and the issue it mdst meet will be its vin
dication of Bunts. Who will make its fight and |
undertake to secure its vindication on that issue?
Let Republicans pause while it is yet time, and con- j
sider whether the party should do this thing now, j
which must go to popular judgment in 1900. Let
them think soberly and well of the consequences of
sending the party's principles, its high history, its I
great record, to the rear, in order to argue its reasons !
for vindicating Mr. Burns and preferring him for the â '
Senate against the whole list of men in its ranks and J
.leadership who needed no vindication against a rec- j
ord willfully made by themselves.
The Democrats are tactical. They are keenly sen
sitive to their position. They have refused to handi
cap themselves by giving an inoperative minority
vote to an aspirant who wanted a vindication.
Let Republicans be admonished. The party is not
a whitewash bucket to be used in disinfecting self-,
damaged reputations.
FRAUDULENT fJPPEAL TO PROVI
DENCE.
IN further consideration of our previous com
ments upon the efforts of the expansionists to per
vert the after-dinner speech of President McKinley
at Boston into a claim that unforeseen contingencies
have thrust upon us a providential mission forcibly
to transform the conglomerated savages of the Phil
ippines into American citizens or American sub
jects, we observe that, in the face of our official
declarations, the only plausible ground upon which
the conquest of the Philippines could have been
placed, without palpable hypocrisy, was a change
of sentiment, wrought by the great victory of Com
modore Dewey. With nations, as with individuals,
unexpected opportunities sometimes produce revolu
tionary consequences. We could not acquire Asiatic
dependencies or Asiatic territory without discarding
our constitution and reverting to schemes of govern
ment against which our ancestors successfully re
belled, nor without breaking the pledges we had vol
untarily made. But history has the faculty of repro
duction, and, as an entire nation cannot be indicted
for treason, if with practical unanimity we prefer im
perialism to democracy or an Asiatic to an American
republic, we can deride the warning and follow the
example of Rome. In that event, however, integrfcy
within ourselves and manhood toward the yearning
millions of humanity must lead us squarely to admit
the fact and not thinly to disguise our retrogression
under a spurious humanitarianism and a pretended
reliance upon Providence. It is within our power,
unless the people should assert their might, and the
sleeping giant of America should quickly slay the
false prophets of destiny, to engulf the sovereignty of
man in "spheres of influence," or bodily to Â»thrust it
through an "open door."
Thus, and thus only, we can share the brutality, the
glory and the profit that other nations, shaped upon
the models we once repudiated, have acquired in at
least two quarters of the globe, through their armies,
their navies and their colonial administrations. And,
having abandoned the theory of the Monroe doctrine
by the annexation of Hawaii, we need not limit our
sacrifice at the altar of Divine Right to Asia, but can
perfect it by welcoming imperialism on this conti
nent. The transformation, however, that would re
clothe the genius of Hb'erty on either side of the
republic with the cast-off garments of monarchy and
replace her inviting smile by a warning menace
should be completed and admitted in the face of
day. It is an illusion and a sham that would be soon
exposed to stand for Americanism in Washington
within the consecrated limits of our Union and for
the absolutism of Caesar or Napoleon everywhere
else. We cannot worship God and Mammon. We
aannot through superior armaments conscientiously
force ourselves upon the Filipinos and quench their
dream of independence in the flood of new-born
American imperialism, while either concurrently or
afterward we preach of government by consent, re
stricted to constitutional simplicities, maintained
without class distinctions, and in which the military
is subordinated to the civil power.
The expansionists have evidently misconceived the
rhetoric and the opinions of our constitutional Presi
dent and have not reckoned with the people, either
through the authority they have granted and limited,
or the sovereignty they have reserved.
While an insane asylum cannot be expected to be
a place of joy, it ought to be made as cheerful as
possible, and the institution at Ukiah is said to fall
fai short in this respect. The legislative Committee,
on Asylums calls attention to this fact, and if the
result be the inauguration of a reform, nobody will
mind the cost of the junket.
A marriage bureau in Seattle is offering heiresses
at the low figure of 50 cents each. No man in need
of a rich wife could complain of thjs rate unless in
deed he happened to be a bigamist, in which case a
discount to the wholesale trade would not be amiss.
Carl yon Tiedeman must be growing weary of being
tried for perjury. Four juries have had a whack at
his case, and each one has disagreed. He will soon
begin to wonder whether he is guilty or not.
The possibility suggests itself that while ex-Mayor
Ellert may have been in the capital to boom a Sena
torial candidate, he did not forget the value and
utility of a garbage crematory.
While the Fair estate doubtless has rights, that of
maintaining a dangerous nuisance at North Beach
ought not to be reckoned among them.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1899.
ACCORDING to a dispatch from Berlin, the
German Foreign Office, in compliance with a
petition from Germans in Samoa, has re
quested our Government to recall Chief Justice
Chambers from the islands and replace him with an
official whose decisions will be more in accord with
German views of justice.
Even if this report be true it will not mean much
more than another episode in what has now become
the diplomatic comic opera of the world. The situa
tion is about as complicated and as amusing as any
ever devised for the entertainment of the patrons of
the stage. It is the outcome of a long course of med
dling and muddling and amounts to something like
a crisis.
Years ago, when the* Americans, Germans and
English began their struggle for supremacy in the
islands, each sought the favor of the natives and
thereby stirred up a little civil war between rival fac
tions led by Malietoa and Mataafa. At first neither
the Americans, the Germans nor the English took
any part in the fighting, but in other respects they
warmly espoused one side or the other and watched
the battle with all the interest of people who have big
bets on the result. '
When the war had gone on for some time, how
ever, Malietoa grew weary of it and petitioned the
British to take possession and annex the group to
New Zealand. Angered by that action the Germans
took arms against the old savage and sent him into
exile. A little later the Americans and the English
took a hand in the game. In the meantime Mataafa
had managed to get into a fight with his German
allies and killed some of them. Therefore it was
easy for the three nations to agree to rtcall Malietoa,
and, upon the express stipulation of Germany, Ma
taafa was deprived not only of the crown, but of the
right of succession.
Just before his death Malietoa recommended Ma
taafa as his successor, and accordingly at the ensuing
e'ection about five-sixths of the natives voted for him.
The opposition party contested the vote on the
ground that Mataafa is ineligible under the Berlin
agreement and the Chief Justice sustained the con
tention. In the meantime, however, Mataafa had
made friends with the Germans again, and they are
now as eager to get him into office as they once were
to get him out.
The Chief Justice claims that he set aside Mataafa
in accb.rd with an agreement made by the three po* r
ers at the special request of Bismarck, who repre
sented the German Government, The Americans and
the British sustain the Chief Justice in that view,
and claim that what they have done has been done
simply to oblige the Germans and keep an agreement
made with the illustrious founder of their empire.
The Germans, on the other hand, claim that the ex
clusion of Mataafa from the succession was not in
corporated in the treaty providing for the govern
ment of the islands, and was merely a verbal agree
ment with Bismarck. They assert further that Bis
marck is now dead and his politics should be buried
with him. It is true they once objected to Mataafa,
but now they wish Mataafa and they denounce the
action of the Chief Justice in excluding- the vote cast
for him as a gross tampering with the ballot-box.
The situation is this. The Germans first sided
with Mataafa, then turned against him and induced
the Americans and British to agree he should never
rule in Samoa, and now they have changed their
minds and wish him to be king. The trouble is the
German mind, when exposed to the Samoan climate,
is too fickle. It looks as if they wished to flirt with
every chief in the islands, and to be wedded to none.
THE RIGHT KIND OF PUBLICITY.
/"â ** OMMENTING upon a bill now before the New
( York Legislature, providing for the establish-
ment of a Board of Chemists to investigate
food adulterations and make analyses of them for
submission in a report to the next Legislature, the
Philadelphia Record, very pertinently, says:
In all the official and unofficial reports concerning
adulterations of food and drink the fatal defect is in
the want of the right kind of publicity. Chemical
analysis will tell to a nicety how much plaster or alum
is to be found in a given sample of flour or bread,
and what the quantity of beans or of cocoanut shells
in a pound of ground coffee. But the reports rarely
mention the manufacturing firms from whom the
fraudulent samples are obtained. Of what avail are
all these analyses and reports when they fail in the
essential requisite of exposing the guilty?
That is about the exact truth of the situation.
There have been abundant reports showing that
almost all kinds of foods are adulterated. From all
sorts of authorities, many of which are official, the
public has been given information of the wide variety
cf fraudulent articles sold under the name of foods.
In support of the very bill now under consideration
it is said the chemist of the New York Agricultural
Department has submitted exhibits of adulterated
foods, among which were samples of beans in coffee,
plaster in flour, paraffine in butter, "tea dust" in
bohea and ground pumpkin in tomato catsup. It is
asserted that investigation would show adulterations
in nearly all articles of food in the market.
It is clearly of no value to the public to make pub
lications of that nature. The only effective way of
protecting the public would be the publication of the
names and brands of the fraudulent articles, together
with the names of their manufacturers. Such an
exposure, if it could be made one of widespread pub
licity, would go far toward driving the rascals out of
business. At any rate it would furnish the people
with information of practical value, and that would
in itself be a long step toward suppressing the evil.
Attention of the Senate Committee on Morals is
respectfully called to the circumstance that the race
tracks hereabouts are in constant operation, and,
with their poolroom adjuncts, supply the method by
which raw material is worked into defaulters, sui
cides and murderers. Thoughtful people would be
glad to see an effort made to correct the evil. Surely
no member of the committee is interested in the
'"sport?"
General Linares has challenged the Count who has
been clamoring for the shooting of the Spanish offi
cers who were obliged to surrender. The Count
should be grateful. He has not only the opportin
nity of inflicting the penalty he considers due, but of
appreciating how it is himself.
When the Speaker of the House reaches the con
clusion that he is a bigger man than the President,
and sets about demonstrating it. the irresistible force
and the immovable body are getting dangerously
close together.
Agoncillo, who is in Canada, questions the veracity
of General Otis, who is in Manila. Distance is known
to lend enchantment, but occasionally it lends cour
age also.
Another boy has been led into crime by associating
with habitues of the race track. There is no reason
for surprise. The list is simply growing.
THE SOMOON MUDDLE.
THE PACIFIC COAST EXPOSITION.
We regret to notice that some of our
most esteemed contemporaries of the in
terior are disposed to take a narrow and
[ ungenerous view of the proposed Pacific
Ocean Exposition. They seem to feel an
ger at San Francisco, and to fear that the
scheme Is but one on the part of that
city to wring money from the people of
the interior and congest it In the metrop
olis for the benefit of landlords and eat
ing-house proprietors.
This is a mistaken view. Even if such
ignoble purpose actuated the well-known
public men advocating the exposition, it
would be insufficient reply to a proposi
tion entitled to be treated upon its meritfl.
No matter what the character of any ex
position, convention, public gathering or
display, long or short in continuance, nor
how high and lofty its purpose, it would
inure as a matter of course to some ex
tent to the benefit of the place in which
it is held. Yet we doubt very much if the
proposed exposition will be a means of
profit to San Francisco. She will be likely,
nay, be required by the very stress of con
ditions, to put up considerable more
money than she will get out of it.
But these are vulgar considerations.
The only one worthy of Intelligent con
cern at all 13 this, Is such an exposition
desirable for the coast, In view of the
importance it is now assuming In national
concern? - We respond unhesitatingly In
the affirmative. That is all there is In
the question. If such an exposition will
substantially advance the coast Interests
In the eyes of the world, and as they de
serve, then it is desirable at any cost.
If it will not tend to enlarge intelligence
concerning the Pacific States, Pacific
Ocean commerce, our relations to the

Essex, Conn., of old Continental
stock, being a direct descendant of
Miles Standish, the famous Connecti
cut pioneer. He served through the
Civil War in the Fifty-sixth New
York, and afterward went to sea.
About twenty-five years ago he
came to California. -His regular
business is ship carpentry, but be
ing a first-class mechanic he turned
his hand willingly to anything that
offered.
Two years ago his sight began to
fail and although he consulted the
best oculists in the State, he soon
found himself almost blind. Not
wishing to become an object of pub
lic charity Mr. Florence took out a
few copies of The Call to sell. His
business has grown rapidly and he'
now finds himself the proud posses
sor of a business yielding a steady
income.
Last fall he was granted the priv
ilege of erecting a little stand on the
sidewalk, but property-holders in
the vicinity objected and the mat
ter was finally tabled by the Board
of Supervisors. Mr. Florence was the
organizer of the "Continental Army"
which attracted so much attention
in the Fourth of July parade of lsito.
It consisted of representations of
Washington and his staff, the Conti
nental troops before going into bat
tle, their bedraggled appearance
after seeing two years' service, and
the half-famished, half-clothed band
that stood to the end.
Mr. Florence has also been promi
nent in Grand Army matters on this
coast, having served on the commit
tee which received General Grant
when he paid his visit to California.

Teddy Hale Arrested.
A warrant wag issued yesterday morn

Teddy Hale, tho ex-champion cyclist, on
lands beyond the seas, our coast produc
tion and capacity; If it will not tend to
crystallize sentiment In the nation upon
the importance of the Pacific Ocean com
merce, then it will be folly to promote it.
We believe that such an exposition as is
proposed will be of first value, highest
importance and immeasurable benefit to
the entire coast, and for the matter of
that, to the nation at large.
The interior of the State cannot afford
to take a narrow and selfish view of such
a question as this. It cannot afford to
confess that it ia actuated by cross-road
purposes and governed in its judgment
by barroom considerations of public pol
icy. The interior is as intelligent and
broad on all great questions as the me
tropolis can possibly be, and it is entitled
therefore to have its press be fairly ex
pository of its true sentiment. True, there
may be in some sections respectable sen
timent opposed to the exposition because
of misinformation concerning the matter.
But we apprehend that wherever the sub
ject has been laid before an interior com
munity fully, ffeirly and plainly, there will
be found generous approval in response.
It is, in fact, not a San Francisco en
terprise, tlTough to the credit of promi
nent citizens of that city in the matter
of suggestion and initial movement.
But it is really a national affair, one
that will not only engage our attention
and should enlist our best energies, but
will greatly concern every foreign power
having possessions bordering upon the
Pacific waters; the Governments of all
the Pacific isles; will affect and enlist the
commercial interests of Australia; will
not escape the attention of Russia, nor
fail to quicken the Interest of reticent and.

MRS. CHANDLER COMMITTED.
Her Secrets Locked Up in. Attorney
Farcells' Safe.
Mrs. Rebecca J. Chandler was adjudged
insane and committed to Agnews Asylum
by Judge Cook yesterday morning. After
this phase of the case had been disposed
of, Mary A. Cox, an intimate friend of
the demented woman, filed a petition for
letters of guardianship of her person and
estate. Attorney F. M. Parcells appears
as attorney for Mrs. Cox and the peti
tion will be argued "Wednesday.
Locked up in Parcells' safe are all
the. letters and papers possessed by Mrs.
Chandler, which tell the story of the
friendship which existed between the lady
and the late Colonel Charles F. Crocker, i
They will not be touched until after the
question of guardianship is settled, when
Parcells win make an examination to as
certain whether there is any contract
existing between the woman and the ex
ecutors of Crocker's estate.
The woman desired to become a literary
light and her failure to float the produc
tions of her pen in the channels of the
book traffic is responsible for her demen
tia. Whether her malady is permanent
or not remains to be seen. For years
she has been in touch with many of the
intellectual minds of the State and was
an unusually bright and interesting
woman.

mother and her stepfather, Henry Peard,
the well-known saloon-keeper, bitterly
opposed the marriage. They decided to
get married anyhow, and Short yester

GENERAL SHAFTER EXPECTED

Three Transports Are About ReaSy
to Sail for the Philippines and
Will Clear From This Port
Next Week.
There is no denying that the latest re
ports from Manila have had a most de
pressing effect upon the army officials or
this department. That they consider the
situation " which at present confronts Ma
jor General Otis as serious is evidenced
by their aversion to discuss the outlook.
On one point, however, they are ail
agreed, and that is that this Government
has a very difficult problem to solve in
the Philippines, and while they do not say
so In so many words, it is clear they, do
not hope to see this solution brought
about without the loss of many lives.
They admit that Aguinaldo is in a posi
tion to do much damage by guerrilla war
fare, and the question is just how long
will it take and how large; a force will be
required to subdue him.
Lieutenant Colonel J. D. Mlley, who
'ails shortly for the Phil ppln_ es, said

TO CLEAN A POINTINGâ T. ML. City.
If the "hand painting on canvas" you
desire to clean is an oil painting, then the
following method is suggested, but this
department'gives it for what it is worth,
without recommending it, not having any
knowledge of the value of the experiment:
Having taken the picture out of the frame,
take a clean towel, and. making it quite wet,
lay it on the face of the picture, sprinkling
it from time to time with soft clean water
let it remain wet for two or ttiree days; take
the cloth off and renew it with a fresh one.
\fter wiping the picture with a clean wet
sponge, repeat the process, till you find all the
dirt is soaked Out of it; then wash with a
soft sponzo and let it get quite dry; rub it
with some clear nut or linseed oil and it will
look as well as when freshly done.

Trouble on the Cruiser Philadelphia,
Five of the Cruiser's Crew Are
Sent Home from Honolulu
in Irons.
â The four-masted steel bark Ersklne M.
â Phelps, the first sailing vessel ever built
In the United States of American steel,
. arrived from Baltimore yesterday on her
maiden voyage. The Phelps is Ameri
can from keel to truck, jlbboom to span
ker boom, and a more handsome craft
never sailed into the bay of San Fran
cisco. She made a perfect picture as she
sailed up the bay with her snow white
canvas and black hull showing up in bold
relieif against Marin's green hills.
A full description of the Erekine M.
Whelps was given exclusively in The Call
of August 30 last. Captain Graham, for
merly of the ship "VY. F. Babcock, Is in
command of her, and he says a better or
faster ship was never launched. With a
strong free wind she logs fourteen and on
the wind twelve knots an hour. She is
particularly good in light winds and to
every vessel met during the passage she
showed her heels.
."It was a disappointing voyage." said
Captain Graham yesterday. "In the At
lantic the prevailing winds were from the
north and southwest, but directly we got
into the Pacific the breezes came from
the north and the northwest. Had I
been In the Babcock and encountered the
same weather we would not have reached
port for another month. Oft! Staten Island
we had a hard time of it. Storm after
storm came down upon us and when a
calm followed I counted up the damage
â¢ done. The fore royal mast was carried
away, the fore topgallant and skysail
yards were gone ana the main royal mast
sprung. Besides this, we lost a number
of sails.
'"Off the Horn we had another hard
time of It. During a snowstorm we lost
our spanker boom and a seaman named
Jan Lazinsky fell overboard from the
' mizzen topgallant sail and was drowned.
When the man fell I at once luffed up
and lowered a boat, but it was without
avail. Lazinsky was heavily clothed on
â account of the snowstorm and sank at
once.
â  "In the Pacific we had to beat from 50
te 30. In January we had a remarkable
â¢ SL'erienee. In latitude 2.34 south longi-
t ude 104.14 west there was a violent dis
turbance in the bed of the ocean. It
seemed like an earthquake shock and the
Phelps seemed to be bumping over a
shoal of rocks. I was below at the time
and at once rushed on deck. Tnen I heard
. a loud rumbling noise and for a few min
utes none of us knew what was going to
happen. It all passed away, however,
and in a few minutes you would not
km i w there had been a disturbance.
"We spoke the Chilean ship Temuco .
fifty-two days out from Iquique for Brit
ish Columbia, and after passing her it
v. as almost di continuous beat to port.
From north we met nothing but north
winds and it took us ten days to nutke
l">rt."
â¢ The cabin accommodations on the
.Phelps cannot be surpassed. The cap
tain's quarters consist of a sitting room,
dining room, bedroom, bathroom and
sfiare bedroom. Besides these, there are
six staterooms, the equal of any ocean
going steamer. They are fitted out in
a. most tasteful manner and are sure to
â¢ be occupied when the vessel .^ail* again,
as she is going from here to Honolulu
to load sugar for New York.
Erskine M. Phe^s. after whom the ves
sel was named, is an old friend of Ar
thur M. Sewail, owner and builder of the
snip. After she was fitted out he pre
sented Captain Graham for use on the
ship a magnificent dinner service, all the
necessary silverware and cut glass and
two silver waU-r jugs.
â¢ The Pacific Mail Company's City of Pe
king arrived from the Orient yesterday.
She shows no traces of her collision with
the Japanese gunboat Amagi Kan. The
Peking lost thirty feet of her port rail
and one of her lifeboats, while three of
her plates were dented. Repairs were
made at Hongkong and the mail boat is
â  .now as good as ever. A very hamlsome
testimonial was prenented to Captain J.
Tremaine Smith by the passengers for the
â coolness and skill with which he handled
his vessel during the collision. The Jap
anese warship did not wait to see what
damage she had done, but hurried away
under a full head of steam.
The Peking brought up eighteen cabin,
thirty-four second cabin and forty-threr-
Chinese steerage passengers. Among
those :n the cabin were Lieutenant Con
rad. John D. Williams and Colonel W. S.
Martin. I". S. A., and H. B. Price, New
â toa Mansfield, S. G. Magil and H. If. Jen
â  ten. U. S. N. Mr. Mansfield was one of
the engineers on the supply ship Iris and
r at Honolulu.
The battleship Oregon arrived at Hono
â  lulu from Callao on February 5. but it was
fix days later before her supply boats
made port. The Iris and Scindia had a
. hard time of it. When the Gallapagos
were reached it was found that the Iriis'
boilers were leaking and that very little
â¢ steam could be made. The captain of the
battleship came to the conclusion that
the best thing he could do was to make
for Honolulu at full speed and leave the
. Scindia to take care of the Iris. All went
well with the supply ships for twenty
four hours after the Oregon had raced
away and then the crown sheets of the.
Sclndia's boilers gave way. The two
boats made their way to Honolulu like
ducks with broken wings to find that the
. Oregon was in port six days ahf-ud of
â  them. The battleship was almost clean
out of coa! when one arrived and had to
take on a supply at once, as ehe could not
take chances on the arrival of the Scin
dia.
The cruiser Philadelphia arrived at
.Honolulu on February 11 from San Diego.
Sh*> was expected to remain a week in
port and then proceed to Samoa. There
was considerable disaffection among
the cruiser's crew and nve of the ringlead
ers were sent, back hen- In Irons aboard

RICH PRIZES HUNG UP FOR
SUCCESSFUL ONES.
At Union Park There Will Se Cups
Which Must Be Won Three
Times to Become Private
Property.
An idea can be formed of the great suc
cess which Ingleside Coursing Park Is en
joying and the anxiety of leashmen to
have their dogs represented at each meet-
Ing by a glance at the drawing which
took place last evening in Pythian Castle.
One hundred dogs were entered lor the
big stakes which will be run for on Sat
urday and Sunday, and in point of en
tries for any special meeting this breaks
all existing records. Notwithstanding
that championship cups will be run for at
Union Park also on Saturday and Sun
day, It seems that the prominent leash
men held back their entries until last
evening, expecting 'to capture some of the
very valuable prizes that are offered by
the management of Ingleside Park.

GIANT FILTER
IN COURSE OF
CONSTRUCTION
Will Provide Pure and
Clear Water.
FEATURE THAT STANDS UNIQUE
PABT OF THE SPRING VALLEY'S
SYSTEM.
Will Cost Nearly Half a Million Dol
lars and Be Beady for Use by
September Next.
In a great work that it has just be
gun in the neighborhood of Sunol, Ala
meda County, the Spring Valley Water
Works is making a record that is
unique in connection with furnishing
large cities with adequate and pure
supplies of water. It is constructing an
auxiliary to its water system for San
Francisco that will comprise as one of
its features a large filter basin with a
superficial area of not less than 200,000
square feet. By means of this all the
water obtained from a watershed drain
ing about 500 square miles will be
filtered through a natural bed of gravel
before it enters upon its travels through
the conduits of the company to its
thousands of patrons.
In the year 1887 the Spring Valley
Water Works began operations on the
eastern side of the bay for the purpose
of conducting the waters of Alameda
Creek across the bay of San Francisco
and adding them to its already vast
resources on the peninsula o.f San Fran
cisco.
Since that year more than 16,000,000,
--000 gallons have been drawn from Ala
meda Creek and furnished to the city
of San Francisco, thus augmenting in a
most material manner the water sup
ply on this side of the bay.
To show the necessity of the addition
of this magnificent auxiliary water Bup
ply for this city at and since the time
of its acquisition, it is sufficient to
state that the reservoirs of the Spring
Valley Water Works on the peninsula
now contain in the neighborhood of 12,
--000,000,000 gallons, which would never
have been possible had not the com
pany had the aforementioned, waters
of Alameda Creek from which to draw.
Always exercising the utmost care
and vigilance as to the quality of the
water it undertakes to supply to its
patrons, the company concluded to im
prove the manner in which the water
was drawn from Alameda Creek. Dur
ing rainstorms and freshets the water
of the creek becomes very riley or
muddy, necessitating the shutting off
of this supply. If this were not done
there would have been danger of filling
the submarine pipes extending across
the bay of San Francisco with mud.
But aside from this inconvenience the
company naturally did not want to
carry muddy water to San Francisco.
In order to remedy this defect lands
and water rights were secured along
Alameda Creek at an elevation of about
200 feet above high-water mark, near
Sunol Station. Here a concrete dam
was constructed. About three-quarters
of a mile above this Sunol dam the
two main creeks of this vast watershed
come together. The stream coming
from the south is Calaveras Creek,
which controls about two hundred
square miles of watershed, while La
guna Creek, coming from the north,
controls more than three hundred
square miles of watershed, making a
total area drained by these two water
courses of more than five hundred
square miles and all controlled by the
Sunol dam.
Between the forks of these two
streams a magnificent gravel bed from
an eighth to a fifth of a mile in width
and fully a mile in length is situated.
In this gravel bed the company pro
poses to excavate a large filtering
basin, containing 1 in the neighborhood
of five acres, and which will be about
two hundred feet in width and about
a thousand feet In length. It will be
necessary to excavate the surface
gravel from ten to twelve feet to get
Sown to the water level. A further ex
cavation will then be made of from ten
to twelve feet below the water level.
At the northern end of the huge filter
ing basin a masonry gateway will be
built from which 36-inch cast
iron pipes will carry the water under
neath Laaruna Creek into a masonry
lined channel 3500 feet In length on the
north bank of Alameda Creek to the
north end of the Sunol dam. This dam
will he so broadened and raised that
the aqueduct described will lead
through its hollow top to the south end
of the Sunol dam, whence It will con
duct the water into a masonry-lined
tunnel 1000 feet in length. From the
outlet of the tunnel it will enter an
aqueduct 4000 feet long, masonry lined
and with a covered top to protect it
against floods. From the lower or
western end of this aqueduct a flume
five feet wide, three feet deep and four
FAVORITE THEATRICAL TREASURER.
Will Receive a Testimonial Benefit at the
California This Evening.
FEW theatrical treasurers are as well known and well liked as Louis A.
Morgenstern, who presides at the box-office of the California Theater.
It is on that account that the testimonial benefit, which the management
will give him this evening, is expected to be a largely attended and
successful affair. It is given in accordance with a custom which prevails in
the Kast of giving a benefit annually
to {hose intrusted with the financial
end of the playhouses.
The attraction will be the Black
Patti and her able corps of assistants,
who have learned a lot of new songs
and jokes, so as to give Mr. Morgen
stern a good send-off. The cakewalk,
which has been increasing in excite
ment every night, will be rendered
with renewed zest, and the colored
participants will surpass themselves In
the execution of the "pas ma la" and
other steps. The advance sale of seats
portends a crowded and fashionable
house.
Louis Morgenstern has been con
nected with theatricals In this city
during the past eighteen years. He was
for several years with Emerson's
Minstrels, at the old Standard Thea
ter, and was allied with Al Hayman
for over ten years. He has been
with the firm of Gottlob. Marx & Co.
for two years past, and is regarded
highly by his employers as well as
by the theater-going public, with
whom he at aJI times comes in
pleasant contact.
and one-half miles long will carry the
water to Niles Station, where it will
be connected with the present system.
By the construction of this conduit
from 75 to 80 feet pressure will be
added to the present submarine con
duits, and the daily volume of water
sent across the bay to the Belmont
pumping station will be increased about
30 per cent.
This above filtering basin will be fully
protected against floods by the -material
excavated in constructing the basin,
which will form a substantial embank
ment entirely around it.
The waters from the Calaveras water
shed direct and also those from the
other contiguous watersheds will be
poured upon the extensive gravel beds
above and next adjoining this filtering
basin. They will sink into the porous
gravel and appear again in a filtered
state in the before-mentioned arti
ficially constructed basin. From this
there will be drawn a supply in the
manner previously described, and in
quantities largely in excess of the pres
ent supply and delivered to the people
In the city of San Francisco.
Another important result that will be
achieved by this improvement will be
the purifying of the flood waters of La
guna and Calaveras creeks. They will
be prevented from entering the filter
ing basin direct, but will furnish their
supply by subterraneous channels. In
this way all muddy water will be ex
cluded.
It is estimated that the cost of the
Improvements outlined will be in the
neighborhood of $450,000. The entire
work is expected to be finished and in
active operation by September of this
year.
The maintenance of an efficient water
system for so large a city as San Fran
cisco Is made more difficult than ordi
nary because of the long dry summers
and the uncertain winters. It is to
guard against a shortage in dry years
that the company has been making con
tinual additions and improvements to
its system. The idea is to have in re
serve in its many reservoirs water
enough for at least a two years' supply.
In 1887 this foresight on the part of
the management of the company was
well rewarded. At that time San Fran
cisco was threatened with a water
famine. The company had found its
supply diminishing until it was too
small for dependence to be placed upon
the coming winter's rainfall to replen
ish it. The summer was at hand and
a light rainfall might ensue. The com
pany, however, was able to cope whh
the situation. At an expense of $1,750,
--000 it built a stone dam on Alameda
Creek and an iron conduit leading
therefrom to Dumbarton Point, thence
with two submarine pipes crossed the
bay to Ravenswood, where connection
was made with a wronght iron main
extending to a pumping station at Bel
mont. Here the water was elevated
about two hundred feet and by gravity
was carried through an iron conduit
extending to a point about two miles
north of San Mateo; there it was con
nected with the 44-inch main that ex
tends from Crystal Springs to San
Francisco. An abundance of water was
thus secured, the danger was averted,
and the people of San Francisco re
mained in ignorance of the danger that
had threatened them and of the service
that had been rendered by the com
pany.
Another great improvement in con
templation by the company is the con
struction of an additional reservoir on
the hills back of the branch County
Jail, formerly the Industrial School,
where a tract of land has been pur
chased for that purpose at an elevation
of 300 feet above tide. This reservoir
will have a capacity of 100,000,000 gal
lons, or three times the capacity of the
Lake Hondo, reservoir which now sup
plies that section. This will make ten
reservoirs that the company will have
in operation within the city. The others
are as follows, with their respective
elevations above tide:
Clarendon Heights 600 feet
Lake Honda 377 feet
Clay-Street Hill 375 feet
Holliday Hill 375 feet
Russian Hill 306 feet
Potrero Heights 300 feet
College Hill 210 feet
University Mound 175 feet
Francisco street 139 feet
Owing to the high altitude of these
reservoirs a very important element is
added to the value of San Francisco's
water system. A pressure is obtained
that is of great assistance to the fire
department when fighting fires in high
buildings. The company has during
the last three years replaced from fifty
to sixty miles of small street mains by
large ones, thus adding greatly to the
efficiency of its system for suppressing
fires.

MONEY ABUNDANT.
The New York circular of Henry Clew* says:
. "The excess of exports over imports for the '
elglit months ending January 31 amounts to ;
,$439,340,000. This excellent showing, together
*ith that of the New York banks, which
' represents an Increase in deposits for about the
â¢ lane period of over $200,000,000 has made it .
possible for this country to take from Europe
SfS.ww.OOO of our securities since the first of ;
.January without any evidence of discomfort
'or fatigue: and. as an evidence that this in
crease in the New York bank deposits is not ;
â  at the expense of other sections of this conn
â  try, money everywhere at all centers is quite '
. as superabundant as it Is in New York - City.
IX poes without saying that the entire circu
lating medium to-day in gold, silver and pa
per is seeking active use in securities and |
"â sound financial enterprises, thus showing the |
â  existence of full confidence prevailing from i
cene end of the nation to the other In the
!. soundness of the business situation. When
'. confidence is strong everybody that has money
-.- is anxious to place it where It will bring In
terest and dividend returns.. When there is a
lack of confidence the universal feeling is to
â¢look up principal and sacrifice the Interest. :
..This is hoarding, and always produces scarce
â " money and high rates for its use. At the
â¢ present time competition is with the loaners of
â¢money, they vying with each other to make j
â  tie best use of it. When there is no con- i
'.flVience the competition is with borrowers, who i
' are compelled to pay whatever is asked for its j
use."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 23.â T0-day's stock market
on dealings in excess of a million shares was
extremely erratic, and the net results showed i
' prices about even between the bulls and the
"bi<i.rs. Tin? most significant losses were made
irf sugar and the granger group, Burlington
.figuring for 3%. The leaders In the other col
. unn were Tobacco, the Minneapolis ; and St.
Louis shares and Third Avenue. The market
â  waa strong, with a considerable demand for
â¢ foreign account, London taking fully 60,000
\ shares, over half of which were the Atchisons.
, Plenty of selling orders appeared and prices
receded from the opening figures, in some cases
;-Bharply. A rally ended with Tobacco, the
â¢coalers and the grangers. Tobacco's strength i
â¢was accompanied by the announcement that a I
â  settlement with the opposition concern was im- !
minent, which involved a consolidation of in- !
terests. The action of the Burlington directors
on the refunding scheme not fulfilling expec
tations entertained in some quarters resulted
â¢in a sharp break in that property, which was
â â¢accompanied by a simultaneous break in sugar
. A report was circulated widely that a large
.Issue of new Government bonds was impend
ing, and this attended a sharp raid. The Infor
mation was said to have been received in a
private dispatch, but no confirmation was ob
, tamable. Tobacco fluctuations on the various
reports were very sensational. It opened up 7
' points at 178 and slid off to 172, rallied to 173
and closed at 155%. One Interrelation of the
' deal reported was that the rival company
Union Tobacco, was to be transferred to the
Continental Company, which is owned by the
American Tobacco Company. Metropolitan
. after dropping 4 points from the opening, ral
lied 5%. and closed a point off, while Third
..Avenue lost half of an 8-polnt rise. Consoli
dated Gas worked up 4% and then suffered a
decided break. Minneapolis and St. Louis
shot up about 7 points and the second preferred
6 point? on rumors that the directors might
retire the company's first preferred. Special
rtrength was shown by American Steel, gain
ing 3 points when the general list was crumbl
ing. This was due to glowing reports of the
company's business, which emanated from
parties connected with the property. Sugar was
supported in the early dealings. The coalers
. averaged 5 points up. with Jersey Central ex
ceptionally, Jumping 3% on renewed reports of
progress toward regulating the coal trade. The
market closed Irregular, with a weak under
tone. : .
The bond market displayed a marked degree
of strength, which was not Influenced by the

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS.
Apprehensions regarding the Peach and Apri
cot crops this year are being felt, as last year's
drought affected the fruit buds.
The New York Raisin market Is thus reported
by mall "Raisins are quiet. Demand Is limited
to small orders from local or near-by distrib
utors. On the ooast a light demand Is re- j
ported and movement is limited to a few cars j
a week. â  Pacifies have been In most demand |
but the supply is practically exhausted, every- i
thing remaining being in the hands of specu
lators. Layers meet no demand, and the pros- |
pect la that 40,000 to 50,000 boxes will be made
Into loose of some grade. There are more than
40 cars of Sultans held by the association at 4%c
f. o. b.; which the trade refuses to consider.
The future will have to determine what will
be done with the oversupply of these goods.
It is said that a good demand for Raisins at
:-iVaf.<- is reported, but the association has
Fon.ething to satisfy It."

Harrison's circular says: "Since the : Marl
popa left the following Coal vessels have arrived
â¢ from Australia, viz: . Undaunted, 2513 tons;
Leicester Castle, 3124: General Roberts, 2872;
; Centesslma, 4480; total, 12,989 .tons. The re
: ported engagements of coal carriers from Syd- \
ney and. Newcastle for San Francisco, number i
thirty-six, with a capacity to carry 95.000 tons; i
of these twelve are already afloat. Australian i
fuel is in very light supply here, a* every cargo ]
that arrives goes direct to the consumer, hence
; there is but little here in yard. At this time
in 1898 there were fifty-two vessels listed for
coal from Australia for here, showing a marked
shrinkage In shipments this year. If we had !
our usual rainfall to date, Insuring an average j
harvest, we would I have had equally as gener- ;
; ous a loading list as last year, but for the mo- ]
ment shipowners prudently avoid our port, as,
fearing a light harvest, they will not send I
coal-laden vessels here seeking outward bus!- j
ness. 'A copious rainfall within the next twenty
days would materially alter our present â  situa- j
tion. We are in no. danger of a fuel famine,
as our coast collieries can readily supply all I
! our requirements. Of "course,!- with no foreign
competition,- they will probably establish 5a i
higher schedule- of values. Large consumers
i have not been' liberal buyers for future deliv
ery, as they have . been anticipating generous
I shipments of foreign coals. The present out
look Is rather disappointing."

ROBERT HEANEY SAID
TO BE A DEFAULTER
A YOUNG BUTCHER BOY WHO
FELL FROM GRACE.
Becomes Addicted to the Gambling
Habit and Spends His Em
ployer's Money in
Pool Rooms.
Until a few days ago Robert Heaney, a
young man in the employ of William F.
Roberts, a butcher doing business at 2817
California street, stood high in the esti
mation not only of his employer but of
a large number of the best citizens of
the Richmond district. Heaney, who is
just turning into man's estate, having
passed his twenty-first birthday, had been
employed by Roberts for the last two
years as his confidential clerk, taking or
ders and collecting bills from the resi
dents of the Richmond district.
Until about two months ago every cent
collected was faithfully turned in and ac
counted for, and Roberts had come to be
lieve that he had a model young man in
his service. One day young Heaney paid
a visit to one of the many poolrooms in
the down-town portion of the city and
was induced to place a bet on one of the
horses.
The gambling mania soon obtained con
trol of him and he began to retain a por
tion of his collections, to be used in his
unconquerable desire to pick a winner.
The result is Roberts is out 5400 and
young Heaney is reported to the police as
a defaulter and a fugitive from justice.
Roberts in looking over the names of
the customers who had been prompt in
the payment of their bills found that
there was in many instances an unpaid
balance and In a good many cases no col
lections made so far as Heaney's returns
showed. An investigation supplemented
by interviews with the supposed delin
quent customers soon convinced the
butcher that there was a screw loose
somewhere.
Roberts* eyes were further opened when
he was informed that his employe was
accustomed to pay nightly visits to the
poolrooms and while there place money
on the horses.
Heaney has disappeared and the police
are now looking for the sporty young
man, while Roberts is examining his ac
counts to determine what his loss will be
when all the bills are gone over.

Dr. Gibbons signed a death certificate,
which was countersigned by Coroner Hill.
Alcoholism was given as the cause of
death, but Mr. Hotaling had been troub
led with sinking spells lor some time and
his heart was also affected. Two days
ago he returned from Coronado by boat
and suffered a great deal from seasick
ness. Since his return to the city he has
been unable to be about. Yesterday morn
ing he was taken with a sinking spell and
Dr. Gibbons was summoned, but could not
save the young man's life.
The deceased was born in this city in
1864. For a number of years he has been
manager for A. P. Hotaling & Co., and
owned an interest ln me business. He
leaves a widow, who was formerly Miss
Ella Kaufman of Portland, and two
children. Mrs. Hotaling and the children
are at Coronado, but were notified of Mr.
Hotaling'a death last night and will re
turn here to-day. The funeral wilt be
held from the house of his parents next
Saturday, and will be strictly private on
account of the health of the father, who It
is feared will not long survive his son.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAM,, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1899*
WILLIAM A. BISSELL HERE.
Will Assume Charge of the Santa Fe Road's Western
Traffic Department.
After much heralding "William A. Bissell, the assistant traffic man
ager of the western department of the Santa Fe road, arrived" in this city
yesterday morning and registered at the Palace. In his party are J.
Sterling Morton of Nebraska, formerly Secretary of Agriculture under
President Cleveland; his son, Paul Morton, second vice president of the
road; E. C. Chambers of Los Angeles, general freight agent of the sya
tem. and Hugh Curran of Chicago, Mr. Bissell's private secretary.
Paul Morton says his visit here is mainly for pleasure, but he will In
cidentally look over the ground and the prospects for his new road, now
that it will parallel the Southern Pacific in California.
"We expect to have through connections at Bakersfleld in July," said
Mr. Morton, "and we will be operating trains from Stockton to the East
before the end of the year. It is not our present intention to erect big
offlce buildings or depots here, as has been reported. The present accom
modations will suffice for the time being. Our Oriental connections in
San Diego are doing nicely, but we have not decided to establish a line of
steamers from this city to China and Japan as yet, but would be glad to
do business with those already in operation.
"Mr. Bissell will have full charge of the commercial interests of the
Santa Fe west of Albuquerque, the freight and passenger traffic beins
under his entire supervision. Thi3 will include the old Atlantic and Pacific
system, California Southern and the San Francisco and San Joaquin
lines. He will hold an independent position which will give him authority
to represent the road in conferences with high officials like J. C. Stubbs
of the Southern Pacific.
"It is not our purpose to inaugurate a rate war as soon as we have
established our Eastern connection, for that means a serious lops to the
roads that indulge in them. We propose to make a fair bid for patron
age and we are hopeful of getting a good share of it. I may take up the
subject of terminal facilities during my stay here, but I cannot say
whether anything definite will result therefrom."
William A. Bissell is no stranger to this coast, having been here for
some years with the old Atlantic and Pacific. For the last four years he
has been assistant freight traffic manager of the Santa Fe, with head
quarters at Chicago. His promotion is well deserved and a tribute to his
thorough knowledge of the freight and passenger question.
"I am simply looking over the situation," said Mr. Bissell yesterday,
"and I assure you I am glad to get back to San Francisco. I do not
contemplate any changes in the officials of the Santa Fe or Valley road.
As to my offices, It is more than likely that I will locate in the rooms of
the Valley road."

MISS OLIVER
WILL TELL A
STRANGE TALE
Brandes' Letter to Be
Produced.
PROOF OF HIS DUAL LIFE
EKE REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS
HIS BROTHER.
XhÂ© Prosecution Is Still Putting
on Its Witnesses in the
Trial of the Murdered
Girl's Father.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 23.
;*â  Emma Oliver will be the most interest-
Ing witness against W. A. Brandes, now
on trial for murder. Her testimony can
not fail to materially aid the prosecution.
It will show Brandes to have been an
adept at leading a dual existence, un
faithful to his wife and dishonest to his
â  employers, inasmuch as he was making
love to the young girl In Alameda dur
ing those hours of the early night for
Which he was paid by Berkeley property
owners to protect them from thieves and
-burglars.
Miss Oliver has required a great deal
of coaxing before she could be
to admit that she knew anything about
Brandes or his love making. She con
tradicted the exclusive story regarding
her acquaintance with Brandes pub
lished in The Call two months ago, and
declared that she had no letter from him
and had never received one. After a lit
tle questioning Miss Oliver broke down
and admitted- to the Prosecuting Attorney
that everything published in The Call is
true, and also admitted a great deal
. more.
Miss Oliver received over a hundred
gushing letters from Brandes. For sev
. eral months prloV to the murder of Lillian
be visited her at her employers' residence
in Alameda three or tour times a week.
He took her out walking and buggy rid
â  ing, but never reached the point of pro
. posing marriage. *uit=s Oliver says mat
. i3ranaes always represented himself as
"William Kalpn, ana that not until she
found an envelope in his pocket, on which
was a memorandum from his wife, did
.Bhe realize that he was Brandes.
The letter she received from him after
his arrest is carefully treasured by the
girl, but she has promised District At
torney Allen that she will produce it in
court. In it Brandes tells the girl that
â  he is In great distress on account of his
.. brother naving been arrested, and he
â¢' (Brandes) explains his inability to keep
" further company with Miss Oliver, on the
. ground that he is going to spend several
â¢ â months in the East raising the fund for
" his brother's relief. He gives Miss Oli
â¢ ver some good advice about marriage and
" .tells her that she is altogether too good
â¢ to marry a waiter or a Spaniard.
Miss .Oliver has stated that she will tes
. tify to these facts. She also tells a most
vivid story of the last visit Brandes made
â  â which was to her mother's house â at
â¢ Fourth and Clay. This occurred on the
night of the murder, and Brandes told
, her that his brother's girl had. died. He
â¢was trembling like a leaf, was cold as
Ice, perspiration poured from his hands
' and lace and his demeanor was such that
"Miss Oliver says she asked him If he
â were crazy. The girl tells her story in
. a most truthful manner and the details
differ nothing from her interview pub
' lished some months ago.
The further cross-examination of Dr.
H. S. Buteau at the Brandes murder trial
to-day resulted disastrously for the de
fense. Attorney Bennett challenged a
statement made by witness; the challenge
was promptly accepted. Dr. Buteau won
.out, supported by authorities cited by the
defense.
Dr. Buteau had just testified that the
apron with which the defense claims Lil
lian Brandes hanged herself could not
â¢possibly contracted the muscles of the
neck, driven out the blood and made the
â¢skin- appear brown and parched, and that
a brown parched appearance of the skin
of the neck of a person hanged occurs
only where the body has remained sus
pended for several hours, It was here
that Attorney Bennett challenged Dr. Bu
teau. He sneeringly questioned the sound
ness of .Dr. Buteau's opinion and asked
for authorities, challenging him to prove
. Ills assertion.
. "Would Witthaus and Becker support
..you in this?" asked Attorney Bennett, ai
xeady having turned to a page in that au
â  thority which he believed refuted the ex
pert. "
"You mean that as a challenge, I sup
pose." replied Dr. Buteau. "Well, I am
certain 1 am .supported by all good au
â  Ithorities."
Attorney Bennett then requested wit
â¢jiess to read a paragraph from Witthaus
. and Becker, which he pointed out. Dr.
Buteau, however, ignored this, since It
V .was but a quotation from Taylor, and in
stead read an extract from Witthaus and
.Becker's opinion, which bore ,out his
- .statement without the slightest diverg
ence, almost to the language used.
. Then Bennett complained that Buteau
(was trying to draw a distinction. Buteau
caught the remark and responded:
. "I am not trying to draw any distinc
tion. I met your challenge, and if you
got the worse of it you should stand
â¢by it." .
Bennett then wanted to know "whether
,the mark on a person's neck suspended
after death could be red, or pink, or the
â¢ color of an actress' tights."
Witness answered that it might be red
dish In color if there was flesh, but that
'he had never seen "pink" in a person
dead or alive.
The examination then drifted to menin
â  gitis as the cause of death, and here Juror
E. A. Randlett asked this most important
question of witness: "In this girl's case
of meningitis, do you consider that she
would have been able to hang herself?"
/Dr. .Buteau uttered an emphatical "No."
Later Juror Randlett asked witness
â what conditions, In his opinion, had pro
. ,dueed meningitis. The doctor replied: "I
â  found no conditions in this child's case
that would account for meningitis except
the blows upon the head."
This concluded. Dr. Buteau's testimony,
' and at 4 o'clock he was excused. He had
been on the stand all last Friday, last
Tuesday and nearly all of to-day. The
. most elaborate and extensive cross-ex
' amination failed to reveal the smallest
.' vista of doubt that Lillian Brandes was
brutally murdered by her father.
Dr. Hubert M. Rowel 1 of Berkeley, who
was present at the autopsy, was next
called, and his testimony, so far as It
went to-day, was similar to that given
by the expert who had preceded him.

DEMOCRATS OF
OAKLAND OPEN
THE CAMPAIGN
Promise to Make a
Hard Fight.
ADDRESS OF HON. W. W. FOOTE
J. L. DAVIE DEFENDS HIS REC
ORD AS MAYOR,
Will Pursue the Same Course if
Again Honored With Election.
Other Municipal Can
didates Speak.
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â The Democratic
campaign opened to-night at the Taber
nacle. Chairman White introduced W.
W. Foote as chairman and said that the
party Intends to make an aggressive fight
till March 13.
Mr. Foote reminded the audience that
he was a pioneer of Oakland and said he
had the Interests of this city at heart.
"If we had a few more spirits here," said
the chairman, 'â¢like John L.. Davie this
community would be far more progres- j
sive. 1 want to say a word about the '
press. There is no act of my life that can j
be too much exploited to suit me. We
have been told that the Democratic con- j
ventlon was controlled by Mr. Moffltt and
! Mr. Brosnahan. This is the story of a
Democratic newspaper, which did not
even mention the fact that we were to t
have a meeting to-night. The personnel
of that convention was above reproach.
H was not run by bosses, arid the trouble
is that the bosses did not run I*. This
ticket was nominated by the Democrats
who work at the polls and who vote the
ticket and not by so-called Democrats
who belong to the party for office only.
I have known Davie, Garrity and Clem
ent for years and I can recommend them.
I shall not Indulge in vituperation, but
I have no use for the men who are forever
being 1 boosted by our political opponents
as the only honest men in the commu
nity."
R. M. Clement, City Engineer, was the
next speaker. He referred briefly to his
term and to the street improvements con
ducted during that time.
John L. Davie, after a lively reception,
opened his speech by reference to the
campaign of four years ago, when he was
elected Mayor. "I was fought then by
! every newspaper on ooth sides of the bay,
I and I expect much the same opposition
this year. The scandals of the nast two i
years could never have happened had I i
been at the City Hall. When I went out
of office the schools were closed because
my opponents said that my dollar tax
levy was too small. Now what do we
see? We have been assessed $1 21 this
year, and yet we hear that the High
School must again be closed for lack of
i money."
"During the last days of my adminis
tration,"'said the speaker, "a sack of gold
wns sent to my ofnce by the water com
panies and I sent It back, and it was
used to beat me."
He declared there would be no Improve
ment until business men, and not tax
eating politicians, were elected to office.
The speaker concluded by reading the re
port of two engineers, showing that a
! salt water plant could be erected for
j sprinkling the streets for $W.OOO, which
is the amount paid annually for sprink
ling the streets.
J. H. Cregan and Abe Jonas, candi
dates for Councilmen-at-Large, also
spoke.
HONORED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM.
John S. Bowman, the Aged Merchant, Sud
denly Called to His Reward.
Death has again invaded the dwindling ranks of the pioneer merchants
of California. Without a moment's warning John 6. Bowman, an hon
ored and respected member of the older business circle, was called to his
reward yesterday morning about 2 o'clock. Wednesday he appeared to be
in his usual good health and spent the day in the park. In the evening,
with his wife, he visited his old friend, Charles Simon, remaining there
until 11 o'clock. He complained of pains In his head and was somewhat
depressed. Shortly before 2a. m. Mrs. Bowman awoke and found her hus
band in intense pain.. She telephoned for Marx Franklin, her husband's
nephew, who immediately went to the Bowman home at 2937 Sacramento
street. When he arrived the aged merchant was dead.
Deceased was born in Schmeidenmuhl, Germany, sixty-nine years
ago, and came to California in the early '50's. He located at Maryaville
and' established a cigar business which was successful, and several years
later removed his business to this city. After a few years of prosperity
he established the wholesale cigar and liquor firm of John S. Bowman &
Co., the late Joseph Coblentz being his partner. In 1890 B. D. Pike enter
ed the firm and the name was changed to Coblentz, Pike & Co., and two
years later Mr. Bowman retired from business. The last few years he has
conducted a brokerage business, lending money on goods in bond.
Before establishing his San Francisco business Mr. Bowman returned
to Germany and married there. Deceased had no children. His widow and
several nieces and nephews are the only immediate relatives, who sur
vive him.
Among the business men of the city John S. Bowman was known as
an honest, good, charitable man, who never had an enemy in his life.
His former partner, Mr. Pike, declares he was one of the noblest men he
ever met, and that his heart and purse were always- open to assist any
body who met with misfortune. Deceased was a member of California
Lodge No. 1, F. and A. M., and also of Saji Francisco Chapter, Scottish
Rite Masons. He will be buried with Masonic honors to-day. The funeral
will be held at Masonic Temple at 2 p. m.
THE "SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1899.
PROSPECT FOR
STILL HIGHER
WATER RATE
The Monopoly Again
Absolute.
HAYWARD BOUGHT OUT
NEED OP ELECTING HONEST
COUNCTLMEN.
Increased Interest Centers in the
City Election to Be
Hold in Two
Weeks.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 23.
To-night there Is but one water com
pany In Oakland, and voters will do well
to consider this fact when they elect a
city government two weeks from next
Monday.
At a meeting of stockholders and direc
tors this morning the necessary number
of shareholders had agreed to sign the
articles of consolidation and before night
all necessary signatures were obtained.
This removes the Oakland Water Com
pany, owned by Alvinza Hayward and
\V. J. Dingee, from the scene and leaves
everything in the hands of the old Con
tra Costa corporation. Competition Is
over and the people will now be expected
to give the monopoly an income on J3.000,
--000 more capitalization than before the
water war commenced. Oakland will now
have to pay for a plant capitalised at
$5,000,000, instead of 55,000.000, as formerly.
As stated in The Call a month ago the
Dingee office will shortly be closed and
all business will be transacted at the Con
tra Costa office across the street. A few
pipes in different parts of the city will
connect the two systems and the attempt
to buy City Councils in the Interests of
the monopoly will commence once more.
Just how this deal will be viewed by the
City Council is a matter of importance
that Is now Interesting every rate payer.
A year ago the contention made by the
two companies was that the income
should be sufficient to pay Interest on
both plants. The Council Committee de
cided that only one plant should be taken
into consideration and now that the com
panies have united tbe law would seem
to say that interest must be paid on the
whole business.
The value of the plant, however, is not
to be reckoned at the figures supplied by
the monopoly, for there is ample evidence
to show that these figures are enormously
inflated.
The testimony of Mr. Dingee and of the
('. mtra Costa people, given before -the
committee, would seem to show that
about $4,000,000 would now be a very gen
erous estimate upon which to base the
rates for the monopoly. The present
Council with its six votes can fix- the
rates for next year, and undoubtedly It
can be expected to do as the corporation
dictates. The Council to be elected In
two weeks' time will have the power to
fix rates for two years, and therefore the
selection of proper men is a matter of
the greatest importance to every property
owner. â

THREE FAVORITES DOWNED
RIO CHICO AWOKE FROM HIS
REVERIE.
Gotobed xinished Behind Merops.
Sardine "Upheld Her Reputation.
Joe Ulhnan Took a Purse.
Odd Eyes Won.
The cork screw legged sprinter Abuse
again left his friends in the lurch at Oak
land track yesterday. Assigned 124
pounds in the six-furlong handicap, he
was readily installed a pronounced fa
vorfte In the betting. "Skeets" Martin
straddled his expansive back, and Fos
ter's horse played second violin from the
time the curtain was raised. Picking up
Joe Piggott and 118 pounds, Miss Ro
wena was first from start to finish, lead
ing the favorite out two lengths at the
wire, in 1f13%. Away badly, Rubicon, the
second choice, ran third. Abuse ran like
a laboring man from the start and quite
evidently was not at his best.
Of the other five favorites, Gotobed and
Recreation were the only ones that failed
to run to expectations. After the big hol
iday throng of the previous day business
In the ring seemed dull.
Odd Eyes, the Burns & Waterhouse en
try, closed favorite for the opening flve
furlong scramble for maiden three-year
olds. Away in front, ane led the big
bunch to the paddock, where distress sig
nals were fiashed. W. H. Martin at this
stage came fast with Florence Fink and
could have won but for being interfered
with by Thorpe on the choice. The lat
ter finally won by a length. Martin
lodged a claim of foul with the Judges,
but after' several minutes' deliberation
on their part It was disallowed.
The two-year-old dash proved only an
exercise gallop for Sardine. The Corri
gan entry was a 2 to 5 chance and won
hands down from Bathos. The start
spoiled the chances of most of the others.
The third event, decided over the Fu
turity course, saw ftio Chico at bewitch
ing odds perform with the dash and vim
of a stake animal. Somebody did not
forget to back him either.. His price was
hacked down to 6 and 8 at post time, and
Bullman ha# him in front almost from
the Jump. Hope disposed of the
favorite Recreation for the place.
The favorite, Gotobed, met more than
his equal in the mile and a sixteenth sell-
Ing run. Leading to the paddock, Devln
on Merops then' squeezed through next
the rail, winning cleverly by nearly three
lengths. Merops had second call in the
betting.
The start in the final spin over the Fu
turity course nearly ruined the chances
of the 7 to 5 favorite, Joe Ullman. Sent
away last. Rutter managed by some hook
or crrfok to squeeze through the bunch,
during the final stages of the running,
and reached the finishing post a neck be
fore Ed Gartland. The latter horse made
all the running. \ *â¢ v

NO SUPERINTENDENT WANTED.
Candidates for School Directors Will
Try to Abolish That Office.
BERKELEY, Feb. 23.â The Republican
Convention which meets in Shattuck Hall
next Saturday evening bids fair to indorse
a platform which may result in seriously
compromising the position of the party
before the voters of the city. It Is now
definitely understood that the Central
Committee in preparing its rlatforms in
tends to make a provision to the effect
that the appointive office of City Superin
tendent of Schools be entirely abolished,
and it will place in nomination a list of
Directors pledged to carry out that
policy.
As a reason for this line of action its
promoters are urging the ground of un
necessary expense. With the Berkeley
public school system, as it now is, having
a force of teachers only about fifty
strong, they hold that no occasion exists
for centralizing instruction to such an
extent as to make the work of a City
Superintendent necessary. Each principal
of a grammar school, it is said, is capable
â if managing everything undÂ«r his charge,
and the work of supervision is only an
uncalled for drain upon the city's
treasury. Accordingly from motives of
economy they will make an effort to do
away with what they claim is a needless
expenditure.
h'ram aoDearances, however, It la cvi
dent that these views are by no mean*
generally shared, and It Is safe to say
that If the Republican Central Committee
continues in Its endeavor to embody such
a provision In its platform, factions must
inevitably be formed.
Such a split is indeed already imminent,
for the Good Government Club, believing
It to be a false view of economy to thus
cripple the School Department, has al
ready declared He intention of opposing
the candidates who are pledged to re
trenchment. The Independent Taxpayers,
who will unite in this campaign with the
Non-Partisans, share the views of the
Good Government Club, and they are ex
pected to make a fight on these grounds.
So far no date has been set for a Non-
Partisan caucus, but the question of re
taining a City Superintedent of Schools is
to be the chief factor in determining
what candidates are to be placed in the
field for School Directors.
The present Superintendent is F. E.
Perham, who has held office for the last
two years, having been appointed by the
Board of Education chosen at the last
election.

TflE LATE DAN O'CONNELL, POET, PHILOSOPHER,
WALTONIAN AND BOHEMIAN.
GRIEF DRIVES
MIRTH FROM
ALL BOHEMIA
Sudden Death of Dan
O'Connell.
POET'S LIFE QUICKLY ENDED
HEART FAILURE FOLLOWED AN
ATTACK OF PNEUMONIA.
One of the Best Known and Best
Loved of California Writers,
His Was an Ideal
Existence.
â¢ '"â¢ Dan O'Connell is dead. The gTlm de
stroyer yesterday with a swift, sure, un
expected stroke, sent woe into the hearts
5 of the innumerable friends of the jovial,
'. generous poet, Waltonian and prince of
â â¢ Bohemians.
!'â¢ "Dear old Dan." as he was lovingly
'â¢"called, was one of those rare souls which
"' always transfused hope and sunshine into
'â¢â¢ the hearts of a.ll who came within the
-.circle of his warm .friendship. As a poet,
* : . and he was a poet, he loved na*ture and
his happiest moments were spent in the
â " sylvan shades of the Sierras.
In days gone by much of his time was
â â¢â¢. /devoted to whipping the mountain J
I-"'.' streams for trout and filling his. poetic
...soul with gems which he afterward
poured forth in song.
' In camp with a few kindred spirits Dan
."was in his element. His appreciation of
â¢ nature's beauties was sublime, but the
â  characteristics of his Celtic forefathers
were always bubbling forth, and he min
gled wit with poetry while preparing the
morning or evening meal. And he was a
good cook. too.
â¢; In Bohemia he was the merriest wit of
.. all. and with his humor ran a wealth of
. sentiment and characteristic philosophy
that bound all men to him with chains of
â¢ lasting affection.
The dead poet was a man of strong in- !
dividuality in many respects, but one had
to know him to appreciate his worth. Ex- j
ternally he was a rollicking, jolly good
â fellow, with never a care and not a
.â¢ thought of the morrow. He was content,
- like Tom Moore, to live for to-day alone.
â¢ Gare came to him as to all men. but he
"laughed it to scorn," and with true Irish
philosophy drove the unwelcome visitor
â  from him.
-. Death, which came so suddenly, was
only an incident. He sought not for fame,
nor for a monument, other than to be al
ways remembered and given a small niche
in friendship's sanctuary. As he once said,
"The only epitaph worth having is 'He
â¢was a good fellow.' "
When the news of Dan's death reached
the Bohemian Club last evening, a pall
of sorrow Cell upon the home of the Owl.
Young men and old. who had heard the
repressive voice of the lamented poet at
i many jinks, when he read some little sen
' timent of his own. felt they had lost a
> brother. And those who knew him best
with choking voice and tear-moistened
eyes told of his manifold virtues. Dan
O'Connoll's absence from the festivals of
â  fun. wit and sentiment, which fill up the
pleasant hours in the Bohemian Club, will
â¢ be regretted as long as the club shall ex
ist.' for his name both in and out of
' â  club life will not soon be forgotten. Near
-1 ly ' every member of the club has some
t personal momento of "dear old Dan," and
this one to Dr. Payne, written on the back
â of. a photograph, is truly characteristic:
. "To Theodore F. Payne:
â¢"And when the years lie upon our shoul
ders, dear friend, like a heavy burden
may we. by "the divine philosophy inher
." ited and acquired, laugh care to scorn,
S and shake hands with the grim reaper, not
â¢ .as.-a foe. but as a friend, in our transla
" tion to the hevaen reserved for good fel
â¢' lows alone. DANIEL O'CONNELL.
; . " "February 6, 1592." .
"' â¢ Many of the dead poet's gems were pub
' lished in a little volume entitled "Lyrics,"
a.nd no sweeter verse has been written by
. : .any of his Western contemporaries. "Sing
â¢Me a Ringing Anthem", is full of -earnest
â¢'. ness and shows the true literary ability
of the writer. One- of his sentimental
poems is here given: ,
â¢ â¢ SWEETHEARTS AND. WIVES.- vt^
. . . â  . . r* . â¢ .. â¢
If sweethearts ..'were sweethearts always,
'â¢â  '..Whether as maid or wife,
C- No dror> would he half 'bo* pleasant
â¢ In the mingled draught of life... . >
â But the sweetheart , has 'â¢ smiles and blushes
When the wife has frowns and â  siÂ£hs. .
. And the wife's have a wrathful glitter
For the glow of the sweetheart's 'eyes.
If lovers were lovers always. â¢ , ' '
'The same to sweetheart and wife, '
Who would change for a future of Eden. V.
The joys of this checkered life?
, But husbands grow grave and silent,
â¢ And cares on the anxious brow
Oft replace the sunshine that perished
At the words of the marriage vow.
Happy is he whose sweetheart -
Is wife and sweetheart stillâ
. Whose voice, as of old, can charm:
*. Whose kiss, as of old, can thrill.
Who has plucked the rose, to find ever
â¢ Its beauty and fragrance Increase,
Af the flush of passion is mellowed
In love's unmeasured peace. .
Who sees in the step a lightness;
Who finds in the form a grace;
â¢Who reads an unaltered brightness
In the â¢ witchery of the face.
Undimmed and unchanged. Ah! happy
.Is he, crowned with such a life,
Who drinks the wife, pledging the sweetheart.
And toasts In the sweetheart the wife.
Since the publication of his "Lyrics"
c Dan O'Connell has written many beauti
ful poems and in all probability the Bo- )
hemian Club will see that they are gath
ered together and published. For many
years tJie deceased has been the almost
inseparable chum of James V. Coleman,
and within the last year they collaborated
on a book which is now in press.
Daniel O'Connell was born in County
Clare, Ireland, in 1849. He came to Cali
fornia in 1868 from the English navy,
where he was serving as midshipman.
He became professor of belles lettres in
the College of Santa Clara, and after
ward held a professorship of Greek in St.
Ignatius College. San Francisco. He then
became connected with journalisni. writ-
Ing for all the San Francisco journals, j
and acting successively as editor of the I
Morning Herald. San Francisco Times. '
the Bulletin, the Chronicle, the Wasp. tin-
Bohemian and that wonderfully excel
lent but short-lived paper inaugurated by
J. M. Bassett. called the Portico.
Mr. O'Connell edited "Caxton's Book."
and wrote admirable stories for the Over
land, especially the one entitled "Thrust
and Thrice." "The Red Fox" was an :
Irish play successfully produced in San |
Francisco" and elsewhere. "The. Conspir- I
acy" was written for Emelie Melville. |
The grotesque stories of the Christmas j
issues have been mostly of the serio- |
comic aristocrats whose claim to great- |
ness consists of owning a goat and a |
shanty upon the sandhills of San Fran- |
cisco.
In his family circle are eight children, !
two sons and six daughters. His oldest j
boy is 24 years of age and is employed by i
thf- Harbor Commission. |
Thf> deceased was 51 years of age, and
hail been married twenty-nine years. He I
was a nephew of the celebrated Irish i
statesman and orator of that name. He j
was proud of his ancestors. His friends
always referred to him a.c the "De
scendant of the Irish kings." Death
came suddenly at 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon. He was ill only four days,
and at no time was his condition con
sidered serious. The cause of death, ac
cording to Dr. Mays, the attending ;
physician, was heart failure, superin- I
duced by an attack of pneumonia. Ar
rangements for the funeral will bo made |
to-day. In all probability the Bohemian j
Club will conduct the obsequies.
EARLY MORNING SUICIDE
IN UNION SQUARE PARK
About 1:30 o'clock this morning a young
man shot himself fatally in Union-square
Park.
Sergeant Harper was standing near the
park when he heard a shot, and following
the sound found the body of a young man
lying over a bench in the plaza. He had
shot himself in the forehead, and death
was fast approaching him. He was about
35 rears of age and was fairly well
dressed.
Fire on Larkin Street.
Fire broke out in the frame dwelling at
2F.37 Larkln street, at 12:45 this morning,
and before the" firemen arrived had com
municated to the buildings on either side.
1235 and 1239. The building in which the
fire originated was partly destroyed, but
the others escaped with a scorching. The
loss will not exceed $1000.
HAS A MANIA FOR FIRE.
MRS. -ALICE SULLIVAN, Whose Insane Attempt to Destroy
St. Mary's Hospital Was Foiled.
MRS. ALICE BUI,L,IVAN'S propensity for building fires In odd places has
landed her In the insane ward of the Receiving Hospital. Up to yester
day afternoon the aged fire kindler was a patient in St. Mary's Hospital
and enjoyed the care and attention of sweet Sisters of Mercy. She
proved her own undoing, however, by attempting to burn her protectors out of
house and home, but her two attempts were nipped in the bud.
During the past week Mrs. Sullivan disturbed the rest of other patients on
the fourth floor by her unearthly shrieks and by destroying crockery and all
breakable furniture in her apartment. As her conduct was deemed to be but a
slight attack of dementia, she was permitted to remain in her room, being con
stantly visited, however, by nurses who attended her every want. Mrs. Sulli
van did nothing rash until Sunday afternoon, when by some means she man
aged to gain possession of matches and the unholy desire to see a conflagration
led her to place her bed clothing on the window seat and set it afire. Fortu
nately, patients in the opposite ward discovered the flames and gave the alarm.
The flames were quickly extinguished by the nurses and the only damage done
was a burned window sash and a broker window pane.
Mrs. Sullivan was removed to another room, and as she became violent she
was secured to her couch. On the same evening she succeeded in liberating her
self, and dragging the bed to a lighted gas jet she raised her bandaged hands
so that the flames ignited the cloth, and had not her screams from pain at
tracted the attention of the nurses the woman might have been burned to
death. Even then the Sisters were willing to endanger their institution by keep
ing her there, but the crazed woman annoyed the other patients by her contin
uous screaming and It was thought advisable to remove her to the insane ward
of the Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. Sullivan Is old and weak, but In her insane moments acts furiously. It
Is probable she will be examined to-day by the Insanity Commissioners and
sent to an asylum. It is. said she has a son in the East.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1899.
WALLER BROS,
FINANCIALLY
EMBARRASSED
May Be Forced Out of
Business.
CREDITORS TO MEET TODAY
ASCRIBE THEIR FINANCIAL MIS
FORTUNES TO DULL TIMES.
Julian Waller Says That if Treated
Properly the Firm Will Pay
Their Debts Dollar
for Dollar.
The well-known drug firm of "Waller
Bros., of which ex-School Director Sam
Waller is senior partner, is in financial
straits. A meeting of the firm's creditors
will be held this morning and a decision
will be reached as to whether or not the
Waller boys, Sam and Julian, will be al
lowed to continue business. The firm has
been in trouble for some time, but not
until yesterday did the creditors make a
move in the direction of a final settle
ment. It is not known just how much the
firm's indebtedness will amount to, but
those who are in a position to know say
that the liabilities will exceed $2000.
The Waller boys estimate the value of
their business at ten thousand dollars,
but they say it would not be worth one
third that amount to anybody else but
them. The principal creditors are the
local wholesale drug firms. Sheriff Mar
tin was consulted by the firm's creditors
yesterday, and in all probability a.n at
tachment will be levied to-day. Julian
Waller stated last night that if given
time and shown proper courtesy me firm
will pay its just debts dollar for dollar.
"We are having a Httle difficulty with
our creditors just at present," said Ju
lian. "I dop't like the idea of going out
of business* and settling with our cred
itors on a twenty-five-cent basis. If we
are given time we will settle with our
creditors for every cent we owe.
â¢'During the last two years business has
been dull and we have suffered financial
reverses on that account. There is scarce
ly any profit in drugs the way prices are
at present. The prolit margin has been
cut down so closely to the line of cost
that it is hardly worth while bothering
with some drugs. The firm's creditors
will hold a meeting to-day and decide
what steps they will take. If they give
us any kind of a chance we will get out
of this financial difficulty all right. When
Sam went into po.itics everybody thought
he was going to make a barrel of money.
When his term was up people thought
he was retiring a rich man. The fact that I
our creditors *Â»Â»o-w have thought that Sam
made money out of his position on the
School Board may have something to do
with their present attitude. As a matter
of fact Sam is poorer now than he ever
was in his life. He didn't make a dollar
out of the School Board."
DEATH REVEALS MARRIAGE.
Mrs. Elizabeth Howard Succumbs to
Heart Disease at Her
Home.
Mrs. Elizabeth Howard, a dressmaker
residing at 14 Turk street, fell dead yes
terday while attending to her household
duties. She was on the back porch at
10:30 in the morning and sank to the floor
and expired. Other inmates of the house
found the body shortly after and called In
a physician, who pronounced life extinct.
The remains were taken to the Morgue
and an inquest will be held to determine
the cause of death.
Among the effects of the dead woman
were a marriage license and certificate
sotting forth that the dead woman was
married in this city on May 24, 1897, to
Charles B. Gray of Phoenix, Ariz., by
Rev. F. C. Fegley. The witnesses were
p M. Brundage of 232 Sutter street nad
M. S. Col cord of 409 Canp street. From
letters found among the woman's effects

in Bellville. in this state.
Mrs. Howard was 4fi years old. Gray's
age is given in the license as 3fi years.
Fire Board Gives Thanks.
At the meeting of the Fire Commission
ers yesterday thanks were returned to

men's Association, for their kind assis
tance in making the presentation of the

MRS. KATHERINE BLOODGOOD.
MRS . KATHERINE
BLOOD GOOD IS
NOT DIVORCED
The Case Decided in
Her Favor.
HAS LEFT HER HUSBAND
THEY WERE NOT CONGENIAL
AND AGREED TO PART.
The Famous Singer Was Pretty Kitty-
Spencer of San Diego Who Had
Hosts of Admirers arid
Suitors.
Mrs. Kathrine Bloodgood, who. was for
merly Kitty Spencer, and who is to-day
one of the foremost contraltos on the
concert stage, arrived at the Palace yes
', terday morning from Portland, Or., where
she recently gave a recital. This fascin
ating artist has obtained much notoriety
of late because of the divorce suit insti
tuted by her husband, William D. Blood
good, of Jersey City, although he is now
a resident of Brooklyn, where the divorce
case was tried. Mrs. Bloodgood fought
the case from the beginning, and the ver
dict was given in her favor. She always
declared that she did not wish a divorce,
and this fact she confirmed last night
when seen at her apartments.
Mrs. Bloodgood was born in Ithaca, N.
V., but came to California when quite
young. She grew up in San Diego. Even
as a girl she was celebrated for her
beauty, and at a very early age she gave
evidence of a rare musical gift. She re
ceived her first encouragement to study
music from D. H. Morrison of Los An
geles, and to him she attributes her suc
cess in her art. He persuaded her to go
to New York, where she studied under
George Sweet. She has appeared in Eu
rope and all the cities of the East, achiev
ing an artistic triumph in every place
she visited.
It was some years ago when she was
pretty Kitty Spencer that young Blood
good fell in love with the sweet-voiced
girl He wooed well and wisely, and much
to the disappointment of many ardent ad
mirers the wealthy Easterner won her
heart. When Mr. and Mrs. Bloodgood
went East her success as an artist be
came known the world over. It was a
painful surprise to her many friends to
learn about a year ago that the couple had
aereed to separate and that a divorce
was being sued for. Finding that they
were no longer congenial, they thought it
best to separate. Mr. Bloodgood desired
a divorce, but his wife objected. There
had been a child by the marriage and she
was averse to the notoriety of a divorce
for its sake. As has been stated, Mrs.
Bloodgood won the cage, but she and her
husband will continue to live apart.
Mrs. Blodgood left New York in Janu
ary on a concert tour, and she may be
heard here in a recital. She has appeared
in Chicago and the other prominent cities
on her trip across the continent. At
present Mrs. Bloodgood is the contralto
of Dr. Cobb's Collegiate Dutch Reformed
Church, at the corner of Seventy-seventh
street and West End avenue. New lork.
Mrs. Bloodeood is a very handsome
brunette with a striking figure. She
possesses a rich and mellow voice that
has been carefully cultivated by hard
study. Mrs. Bloodgood will remain at the
Palace for several days before going to
San Diego to visit her parents.

JAPANESE BRIBERS.
Paid the Money Secretly to Geffensy
and Promised More "Bime By."
The eleven Japanese immigrants who
tried to bribe Immigration Inspector Gef
feney with $5 each were held yesterday
for trial' before the District Court by
United States Court Commissiofllr Hea
cock, and their bail bonds were fixed at
$250 each.
Only one of the immigrants stood an
examination. He testified that he had
been advised by the agent of the steam
ship company at Kobe. Japan, that it was
his duty under the laws of the United
States to pay the Immigration Commis
sioner $5 in each case. It was shown that
the defendant had not offered the money
openly to Geffeney, but had passed it to
him secretly under a corner of the table.
Mr. Geffeney testified that the Jap
promised that he would give him more
money after he got ashore.
The Park Band made a great hit last
Sunday with Mrs. Crowley's Piney
Ridge waltzes.
Capitalist Bodgers Sentenced.
Charles H. Rodgers. capitalist. Tenth
and Folsom streets, convicted by Judge
Mogan Tuesday ot battery upon his sis
ter-ln-law, Mrs. Fay J. Barnes, appeared
for sentence yesterday. The Judge said
that if he had not considered Mrs. Barnes
of "mighty little caliber" his - sentence
would . have been a severe â¢ one. In the
circumstances he Imposed a fine of $50,
with the alternative of fifty days in the
County Jail. Rodgers' attorney gave no
tice of appeal and filed a bond In $500.
MERCHANTS PLEAD FOR
ELECTRIC STREET CARS
ASK SUPERVISORS TO GRANT
DESIRED PERMISSION.
A Suspicion Entertained by Some Of
ficials That Vining Has De
signs on Market Street.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday and considered
again the application of the Market
Street Railway Company for permission
to run cars propelled by electricity on cer
tain down-town streets. The hitch in the
proceedings has developed over the pro
posal to run cars down Geary street and
thence into Kearny.
President Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association and a number of its members
were present to speak, as Mr. Dohrmann
explained, not in favor of the railroad
company, but for the section of the city
interested in the proposed improvements.
He explained that he and his associates
would prefer underground wires, but
these seemed an impossibility at the pres
ent time. He was 1 anxious to see the road
built without objection on the part of
persons who were affected by it. If this
could not be he was desirous of having
it the way proposed rather than not at
all. He dwelt on the opposition to the
original electric cars on Kearny street,
and more particularly to the crossing of
Market street.
He then told of the small number of ac
cidents that had occurred there, and said
that the greater the traffic the greater
the caution of the men operating the cars.
For this reason he asked the committee
not to take too serious a view of the dan
ger attendant -upon running the cars
around the corner of Kearny and Geary
streets. He urged favbrable action on the
part of the committee, claiming that the
opposition was due more to impulse than
any other reason.
For the committee. Chairman Aigelting
er explained that its sole desire was to
benefit the public at large. They would
look into it closely and if it would not
work an injury on the public they would
vote in favor of granting it. The matter
was taken under advisement, with the
promise that it would be acted upon as
soon as possible. No formal protest has
as yet been filed with the board. It is
believed by some of the city officials that
Manager Vining is paving the way for a
petition to be allowed to string wires on
Market street.
Missionaries for Honolulu.
The steamer Moana, which left this
port last night, carried among her
passengers three young ladiesâ Miss
Bushfleld, Miss Whistler and Miss Cheese
man â destined for Honolulu, where they
will open a branch of the Peniel Mission
work. The Missionary Convention, which
as announced in The Call has been in
session since Sunday afternoon at 49
Third street, was brought to a close last
night, and a large number of those in at
tendance went with their departing
friends to bid them farewell. This mis
sion when opened, will make the twenty
fifth on the list of the Peniel Missions,
and the third one that has been planted
beyond these shores, the other two be
ing in Bombay, India, and Port Said,
Egypt. Seventeen are within the bounds
