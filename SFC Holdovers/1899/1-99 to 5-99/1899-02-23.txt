MANILA, Feb. 23.â There is great excite
ment throughout the city. Three fires were
started by the insurgents last night at San
ta Cruz, Tondo and the Binondo market.
The latter fire is working its way toward
the wharves. The natives have cut the
hose. One thousand native houses and hun
dreds of business places have been burned.
Refugees are thronging the streets with
their rescued property.
The houses fired were marked with red.
One American officer and several sol
diers were wounded by shooting in the
streets.
The first fire was started in Santa Cruz
district, and after a period of quiet the fires
in the other districts followed.
An attempted rising of the natives in the
city proved abortive, but sharpshooting
continues and many have been made pris
oners.
Heavy skirmishing took place east of
the city yesterday. It is believed the in
surgents lost heavily.
MANILA, Feb. 23, 9:30
"IV 1 a. â The rebel sympa
thizers in Manila, in pursuance of
orders issued by the insurgent
leaders as set forth in their plan
for rising against American rule,
: attempted last night to burn and
â loot the city.
In order to make sure of suc
cess the incendiaries planned to
â¢start conflagrations in three dif
ferent quarters of the city, believ
ing the flames would soon get
beyond control, and that they j
.would then have a chance to kill j
the foreigners here and pillage j
their property. Santa Cruz, San ;
â¢Nicolas and Tondo were the
quarters selected for the starting
"' of the fires.
â¢. Those who were chosen to ap- - }
ply the torch did their work well. '
â  In a short time after the fires were
. : discovered the flames had spread !
-"to such an .extent that the de

tried. The troops and foreign {
â¢ residents worked manfully to |

stationed everywhere about the
town and the natives were awed
into submission by the show of
force. Matters are quieting down
at the time this dispatch .is sent.
It is estimated that the loss of
property will be very heavy.
About one thousand native
houses and several hundred na
tive shops were burned. The fire,
originating in the Santa Cruz
quarter, threatened at one time
to reach the wharves, but was
checked. The property of Euro
pean residents generally escaped.
A stiff breeze was blowing when the
first fire started at Santa Cruz, and \
the inflammability of the structures j
caused the blaze to spread with alarm
ing rapidity. The city Fire Department
was hopelessly incompetent and the i
English volunteer, brigade from Santa 'â 
Mesa was summoned, and,, with a mod- j
crn engine pumping adequate streams |
from the canal, succeeded after four
hours' work in getting the blaze under
control. â -:>*;'.
Meantime the entire block and the j
greater part of two others across the
street, were completely gutted. Hun
dreds of inhabitants were rendered
homeless.
The Chinese and natives lined the ad
jacent streets, while hundreds more, j
fearing a general conflagration, re
moved their furniture and other port
able goods in every direction within a
radius of a quarter of a mile when the
alarm was first given.
General Hughes personally superin- |
tended the police arrangements. The.
whole city was thoroughly patrolled j
and guards were doubled. Every avail- !
able man was dispatched to the region
of the fire.
Impediments were placed in the way j
of the firemen and the hose was cut I
five times. > This resulted in all the na- j
tives being driven off the streets, those

SENATOR HOAR CALLS IT "RUBBISH."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â "1t is all rubbish," Senator Hoar of
Massachusetts said to-day when the Creelman dispatch from Hong
kong accusing him of treasonable correspondence with the Filipinos
was called to his attention. " It is the veriest rubbish,
I hardly care to dignify it by denial, but you are at
liberty to say that I have never corresponded with
Aguinaldo nor with any member of his so-called
Government. I have never even thought of such a
thing.'* The whole story has created more amuse
ment here than anything else. Mr. Creelman, as
was expected when he started for Manila, has
taken his old habits with him.

Were Started. . '
was started in the Tondo district,
where the natives are thickest; and
when the firemen and soldiers attempt
ed to work a repular fusillade of rifle
and revolver shots were fired from the
windows and roofs of buildingrs.
The firemen, escorted by soldiers.
proceeded to clean out the houses.
while the fire was unheeded. The Thir
teenth Minnesota were reinforced by
detachments from the Third Infantry.
Second Oregon, the Third Artillery and
the Tenth Pennsylvania. Bullets flew
in every direction, in almost every
street in the Tondo and Binondo dis
tricts, causing the most intense excite
ment.
Many timid persons, imagining that
the rebels had effected an entrance
through the American lines and were
advancing into the city, hurried fran
tically from the hotels and houses, only
to be stopped at the first corner by a
guard. The sounding of a native bugle
call immediately preceding thÂ« firing
lent color to the story.
Thousands of Chinese crossed the
bridges and plazas under fire, hurry
ing with their bundles to the Chinese
Consulate. All night long the fire spread
through the Tondo district, sweeping
away rows of houses and devastating
acres of territory.
With daylight punitive measures were
decided upon and the Americans, al
though tired after their sleepless night's
work, soon cleared the district of every
native after a slight resistance.
There is no doubt that the flres were
deliberately set and according to a well
organized plan of the rebel leaders.
The Incendiaries were members of the
secret militia which Aguinaldo organ
ized in the city before hostilities began.
Many of these bands have been
broken up, but others still exist. Hun
dreds of refugees from the burned dis
tricts are in the streets, but the city
is well patrolled, and it is believed the
immediate danger is over.

Thirty Thousand Filipinos
Rallying and a Big
Battle Imminent.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22 âThe Wash
ington correspondent of the Her-,
aid telegraphs: Reports from
General Otis and Admiral Dewey
show that Aguinaldo is concen
trating at least 30,000 Filipinos in the
vicinity of Manila and it would not be
surprising if a battle should soon take
place. Reports show there is little dis
sension among Aguinaldo's followers,
even the insurgents surrounding Iloilo
obeying his orders.
Orders will be issued by the War De
partment In a few days directing: the
Sixth and Ninth Regiments of Infantry
to proceed to Manila. These troops will
take the places of volunteers who will
be mustered out as soon as the treaty
of peace is signed by the President.
The officials have learned that some
of the arms and ammunition which
have been shipped to the Filipinos dur
ing the past seven months have been
sent from this country via China. The
matter is being carefully investigated,
but no action can be taken to prevent
such shipments to China. Rear Admiral
Dewey, however, can seize them when
on their way to the Philippine?.
It is authoritatively denied at the
Navy Departmet.-. that Rear Admiral
Dewey authorized the expedition which
left on the Abbey and was afterward
seized by him. On account of the long
coast line of the islands it is impossible
to establish a blockade, but it ia stated
that all shipments of munitions to the
Filipinos will be seized if possible. The
Benhington arrived to-day at Manila,
according to a dispatch from Admiral
Dewey, and the Yorktnwn is expected
In a few days. The Oastine and the
Princeton will soon* reach there. With
this force of small gunboats Admiral
Dewey will be able to cut off many of
the shipments which will be made to
Aguinaldo.
The authorities here are giving close
attention to the daily developments in
the military situation in the Philip
pines and have decided to push the

campaign against the rebellious fol
lowers of Aguinaldo with energy.
Every casualty report that comes from
General Otis notes the wounding or
killing of some of the American trooos
by what are practically sharpshooters
lon the other side. The .main body of
the insurgents has now fallen back
well out of the line of effective range
of the gunboats, but as the American
troops have been obliged to extend
their lines in order to protect the water
works and to take advantage of the
natural topographical defenses of Ma
nila, the troops are exposed to the fire
of these guerrillas without an opportu
nity to retaliate, for the enemy flees
before an advance in force. This was.
after all, about what was expected by
the War Department officials, and that
was why, in sending reinforcements to
General Otis, they made it a point to
send as many of the regular troops as
possible who had been used to Indian
fighting in the Bad Lands of the West.
General Lawton, who goes to take
command of these troops, is an old In
dian fighter, and soon after the troops
arrive, within two or three weeks, a
forward campaign will begin and a
heavy blow be fitrack that will keep the
j insurgents quiet during the rainy sea
! son. if it does not bring about their im
mediate surrender. It is felt to be nec
essary to do this in order to avoid the
hardships to which the American
troops otherwise would r>e exposed dur
ing these torrential rains, which will
make life in outside entrenchments al
most impossible for civilized troops.
It developed to-day that Sixto Lo
pez, Agoncillo's secretary, left here
quietly Monday night on the train for
New York. Since then nothing has been
heard from him. His hotel room is
still reserved, and the hotel people say
they think he will come back. Dr. Lo
sada, the only Filipino left, is still con
fined to his bed.
DICTATOR AGUINALDO
ISSUES A MANIFESTO
HONGKONG, Feb. 22.â Aguinaldo
has issued a manifesto accepting- the
situation caused by the "unexpected
provocation of the Americans." -while
lamenting the hostilities which he says
he "tried to avoid by every means in
his power, making humiliating con
cessions and tolerating Insults and out
rages of the army of occupation
against the people of Manila." He adds
that he is prepared to sacrifice every
thing "to maintain the integrity of the
national honor," calls on all to "wit
ness the good faith and honesty of his
Intentions," and complains he has been
treated as a rebel, "because I defended
the national interests instead of be
coming the tool of the American pre
posterous pretensions."
The rebel leader further alleges that
the country is unanimous in his sup
port; that the people "will perish
rather than accept the odious Ameri
can dominion," and that "even the cor
rupt Spanish dominion is preferable."
The Philippine Commission is consid
ered by Aguinaldo to be a farce, and
Otis, Denby, Dewey and Secretary Har
den are classed as pronounced annexa
tionists, the latter being charged with
having "maliciously defamed" the Fil
ipinos in newspaper reports. He is
classed as being "especially obnoxioui
to the Filipino Government."
Finally. Aguinaldo expresses the
wish to "proclaim to the world and offi
cially dispel the false rumors that Ger
many or any other power has rendered
assistance, moral or material, to the
Filipinos, nor have the Filipinos soli
cited it."2

MENTO. Feb. 22.â From the inside of
the Burns camp comes news that Ma
jor McLaughiin Is deposed from the po-
Fttion of political manager of this Sen
atorial and Hervey Lindley, formerly
;Â«toria! campaign and Hervey Lindley,
formerly of Los Angeles, elevated to
the Candelaria throne.
For days and days there has been
whispered gossip to the effect that
Herrin was disgusted beyond measure j
with McLaughlin's management of af- !
fairs, and that Dan himself was not de
lighted. Lindlt-y's reputation as a boss
was established in Los Angeles and the j
people of the Southland to-day talk of
his smooth operations, although his ca
reer closed In that region of the State
pome years ago. Ho transferred him
. seJf and his talents from the South to
Siskiyou and Shasta some time ago,
ar.Â«l was falling into obscurity when
Burns called him to Sacramento to look
after Laird, Beecher and other repre
sentatives from that end of the State.
Differences of opinion exists as to the
wisdom of the "Colonel" in swapping |
horses in the middle of the stream. For
several days the onlo-oKers around the
Gulden Eagle Hotel have noticed that
Lindley was at the front. He is some
what bolder than the Major in carry
ing his operations to the floor of the
Senate and Assembly, but it is not cer
tain that his audacity in this^ regard
will win votes for the "Colonel."
i Ibservers note that Martin Kelly and
Phil Crimmins are not enjoying the
same degree of confidence that was ex
tended to them earl} in the campaign.
It is possible that Lindley will direct
his attention to combinations south of
Teh a (j ha pi.
The touts to-night are claiming that
Assemblyman Mut-nter of San Joaquin
will desert General Barnes" vause to
morrow and cast his fortunes with
those of Dan Burns. On the strength
of the report followers of the colonel
are lining up at the bars and drinking
to the health of the Assemblyman. The I
game that caught pour old Senator I
Simpson was tried on Mr. Muenter, but
it completely failed, and despite the
boastings of the touts Muenter has nut
been corralled, and there are no signs j
that he will be coerced or coaxed into j
the corral. He has the assurance that i
a vast majority of the Republican j
voters of San Joaquin County commend ;
his course in resisting the under
handed and smooth work of a faction
of Republicans now engaged in promot
ing Burns' scheme for a secret caucus.
Thomas R. Bard of Ventura paid a
friendly return visit to General \Y. H.
Li Barnes this afternoon. These old
time Californians discussed the affairs
of state and exchanged views on terri
torial expansion and the bearing of
recent events upon the development of ,
the Pacific region of the country. Mr.
Bard is a gentleman of tine presence,
agreeable manners and clear intellect.
In qualities fitting a man for the Sena
torship Mr. Bard is well equipped.
â  Mr. Bard has not yet determined to
.open Senatorial headquarters and ac
: tively engage in the struggle now going
dn. He is here to study the situation
for himself, and after consulting with i
â  his friends will decide what course he
. shall pursue. He is not selfish" or am
bitious, but seems to be animated with
a desire to promote harmony In Re
publican councils. He will not engage
In the contest if his judgment leads to
â the conclusion that such engagement
will add another complication to the
struggle.
The touts of Colonel Burns did not
â¢ derive any particular satisfaction from
the ballot in the joint Assembly to-day.
No gains for the colonel were regis
tered. The gain made for Rosenfeld
yesterday was lost to-day, as Assem
blyman Brooke cast his vote for J. K.
Burnett. There are many' circum
stances that warrant the conclusion
that Burns is endeavoring to secure a
block of Democratic votes by sending
them, through the agency of Sam
Rainey, to Rosenfeld. Early in the !
campaign Burns declared that he would
win with Republican votes or not win
at all. Recent events or incidents cre
ate a suspicion that he has changed his
mind. If he cannot get his desired vin
dication from Republicans he may seek
It in the Democratic party.
The ultimatum given to the Legis
. lature by the touts â "Burns or no Sena
" tor" â has b<Â»en answered by the stal
wart Republicans. The answer is': "No
Senator rather than Burns." Members
â  who were first Inclined to doubt
â¢ whether the Republicans could win the
' next Legislature should the present
â  body fail to elect a Senator believe now
that notice served on the railroad that
the party cannot be dominated by or
ders from the. yellow building would
give to the party in the next election
tlie greatest Republican victory ever
achieved in California. There is a pro
found and growing belief that the elec
tion of Dan Burns would disrupt the
' party. He has no support other than
that derived from Herrin, the local
boÃses of San Francisco and the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Republican
State Central Committee.
The County Committee resolutions
asking that the deadlock be broken by
a- caucus were concocted in Sacramento.
.â¢ -The whole scheme is a Burns pro
gramme. The game is so well under
stood that the publication of such reso
lutions in the railroad organs excites a
smile of derision.
The fact is well known to all the
members of the Legislature that Burns
alone is responsible for the deadlock.
Every other candidate has agreed to
stand aside and permit the election of
' a United States Senator in joint con
vention if Burns would consent. He
tells .his supporters that he cannot agree
. to withdraw under any conditions. He
refers to the assaults by the press and
holds that he must be vindicated. He
â  Js not willing to seek his vindication In
the courts of the land or go before the
people for an Indorsement of his public
record. He demands that the Repub
lican party shall vindicate him in cau
cus. He tells the Republican party of
â¢this State that It roust have him for (
Senator or go without adequate repre
sentation in the Uniied States Senate.
He alone is responsible for the dead
lock, and he expects to wear out the
patience oj the people and exhaust the
resources of other candidates.
General Barnes, Thomas R. Bard, R.
N. Bulla, Irving M. Scott and U. S.
Grant are willing to stand aside for the
sake of securing the election of a Re
publican United States Senator, but D.
M. Burns gives another example of his
selfishness and his utter contempt for
the wishes of the people and the Repub
lican party by insisting that every other
consideration shall be cast aside in or
der that he may be vindicated. Three
weeks ago he was in position to name
the next Republican Senator from Cali
fornia. It is extremely doubtful to-day
whether he can exercise much influence
In that direction. The anti-Burns ele
ments of the Legislature may - put
aside their sectional feelings and re

solve to relegate Burns to political ob
scurity. . .
Many things have happened in Sac
ramento during the past week to in
tensify public feeling against the candi
dacy of Burns. The debasement of
Simpson and the methods' used to undo
the poor, weak sinner, coupled with the
attempt to debauch a member of the
Assembly, tend to provoke a feeling of
bitter hostility toward the touts. The
fact that the supporters of Burns have
been compelled to resort to base meth
ods to get votes furnishes the proof
that the "Colonel" has not that re
served strength in the camps of other
candidates of which he boasted early
in the sesslnn. In truth he has no sup
porters to speak of fn th<e other camps.
His cause is weak and failing.
Had Burns been managing for some
one other than himself a contest as
hopeless as his own he would have, ere
this, advised the man whose fight he
was conducting to withdraw. The old
adage applied to the law applies to
Burns. It holds that a man who con
ducts his own case "has a fool for a
client."

Burns and the railroad.
"Assistant Attorney General Charles
N. Post had a conversation with mt at
the Golden Eagle Hotel," he said to
day, "about the contest that was being
made for my seat in the Assembly by
William Johnston. He said he was
friendly to me and to my interests and
that he did not believe in contests being
brought on partisan grounds. . He went
on to say that he was a friend of Dan
Burns and that he would like to see
Burns elected to the United States Sen
ate. He also Bald that there would
probably come a time when it would
be within the power of the minority
members of the Legislature to elect or
defeat some one of the Republican can
didates for Senator.
"After explaining the situation from
that standpoint Judge Post said that
he would like me to vote for Burns
for Senator. He then said that he
would use his best endeavors to have
the contest for my seat in the Assem
bly dismissed.
"It was not Judge Post who offered
me a place in the County Clerk's office
I of this county if I would vote for Burns.
That offer was made by another person
whom I do not care to name at this
time.
"My interpretation of the conversa
tion had with Judge Post was that he
had intended to convey the proposition
that if I would vote for Burns for Sen
ator the contest for my seat would be
dismissed; that was the impression
made on me by the conversation at the
time and I still think that that was the
meaning intended to be conveyed."
The full details of the manner in
which a place in the County Clerks
office, which was at tlie disposal of
Jack Wright, superintendent of the
Southern Pacific Company at Sacra
mento, was manipulated as a bait to
induce Brooke to betray his constitu
ents, have been published in The Call.
Concerning the conversation had by
him with Assemblyman Brooke, Judge
Post had this to say to-day:
"I never offered to bribe Mr. Brooke
if he would vote for Burns for Senator.
I did have a conversation with him
concerning a contest that had been in
stituted for his seat in the Assembly
and at that time I told him that I
hoped nothing would come of it. as I
believed it had been brought for parti
san reasons and not because there was
any merit in the case. I never told him
I was authorized or instructed to tell
him that if he would vote Tor Burns
the contest would be dismissed, nor di.l
I tell him that I had any authority to
have the contest dismissed in any
event.
VI did tell Mr. Brooke during the talk,
we had in the Golden Eagle Hotel that
I was favorable to the Senatorial can
didacy of Colonel Burns, and that I
hoped he would be elected. I told him
that it was quite possible that condi
tions would arise that would make it
possible for the minority members to
throw the election one way or another.
I am free to acknowledge that I asked
him to vote for Burns, but the reauest
was not connected in any way with my
offer to assist him to secure the dis
missal of the contest for his seat in
the Assembly.
"I did not offer him any place in the
County Clerk's office and my parting
advice to him was to consult his con
stituents and his own conscience in the
matter of casting his vote for Senator.
That is all there is to the matter, ex
cept that I am a friend to Colonel
Burns and I have done and will con
tinue to do all that I can to secure his
election."
The Assembly Investigating Commit
tee has not taken any action in the
matter as yet, and the Impression pre
vails that it will not do so. The Sena
torial situation so far as Dan Burns is
concerned is in such a condition at the
present moment that the Mexican will
use every influence at his command to
prevent such an investigation, know
ing, as he does, that it could only result
In throwing official light on facts that
would certainly reflect no credit on
himself or the corporation that is be
hind him. _____________

HAS BEEN HURLED FROM
HIS HIGH YELLOW THRONE
Senatorial Aspirations of William R. Hearst
| Ruthlessly Shattered in the Minority
Caucus.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â The Democratic mi- j
nortty of the Legislature held this (
morning a caucus that supplied an in
cident of general importance and in- ;
: terest.
The Democrats are becoming bored
by voting for anybody and everybody
â who cannot be elected for United
States Senator, and they wanted to re
lieve the monotony by doing something
ctartling. They succeeded beyond their
â wildest expectations, when Assembly
man Burnett of San Luis Obispo pro- ;
posed that for the rest of the legislative j
session they vote for William R.
Hearst.
if a Spanish bomb had burst in the
midst of the caucusing Democrats the
result could not have been more explo
elve.
Vials of Democratic wrath were
poured in vitriolic streams upon the
head of the devoted William. He was
called everything that is not good. He ,
was denominated as more unspeakable
in his attributes to Democrats than
General de Young is sometimes sup
posed to be to Republicans and the
members of the Democratic minority
were implored not to vote for him un- ;
der pain of costing their party success
as long the name of Hearst may be
used in conjunction with polite Eng
lish.
It was not a pleasant scene. Another
Democratic god had been tumbled into
dust and kicked into smithereens by
the profaning feet of those who were
supposed to be worshipers at a yellow
throne. William will be wise to confine
his political ambition to New York and
the Gubernatorial honor of the Empire
Et-ate.
It was all Burnett's fault.
William as a Democratic joss would
Btill be intact were it not for Burnett,
but the minority wanted something
ee.nsational and Burnett supplied it.
The caucus was proceeding quietly, for
a Democratic gathering, and not even
the murmur of prospective trouble was
In the air. The minority decided unani
mously to vote for Assemblyman Bur- I
JOHNSON'S EYE
OUT FOR THE
MAIN CHANCE
Sacramentans Question the
Motives of Grovel in the
Matter of Bill 611.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â Mayor William Land
and others who are interested In the
governmental affairs of this city are
demanding of Grovel Johnson an ac
counting upon Assembly bill 611 which
he introduced in the Assembly on the
third day of the present month. Also
they are constrained to ask if the fact
that Mayor Land declined to make
Grovel Johnson special counsel for this
to close up the bond deal Just now
going on has any connection with the
fact that the bill introduced by John
son has been buried out of sight on the
second reading file with little possi
bility of its getting far enough along
to warrant a hope for its passage.
Assembly bill 611 is designed to repeal
the act of 1*72 by which Sacramento
waa permitted to redeem its funded in
debt( - Since the enactment of
1572 this city has succeeded in taking
up the bonds that stood against it and
residents of this city. Land among
them, hold most of them.
The iaat of them were liquidated dur
ing the past two years and the commis
sion appointed under the act is anxious
to have this Legislature repeal the law
and thus elope the whole matter so far
.as it is concerned.
To accomplish this Assembly bill 611
was drawn up ahd Johnson was asked
to introduce it. He assented with pro
testations of extreme pleasure at such
a privilege. Then, with as much pleas
ure he had it referred to the Judiciary
Committee, of which he is chairman,
and upon its first appearance before the
committee he made so glowing a speech
in Its favor that it was at once recom
mended to pass.
Those who heard and knew him spec
ulated much upon the incentive ro his
eloquence.
The incentive became apparent vhen
subsequently hf went, rubbing his sleek
palms, into the presence of Mayor Land
to talk over the bill. It was in good
condition, he saiu, and would doubtless
pass, though possibly with some trouble
because of the overloaded condition of
the files. It would be his pleasure to
wetnurse the measure anyway until it
was able to stand for itself. At the
game time, why would it not be ad
visable, the best policy in fact, for
Mayor Land to appoint Mr. Johnson
special counsel to handle the matter?
It' was not a sparsity of brains that
bulkled up the big fortune the Mayor
draws- his checks on and Johnson's
gairje was not a difficult one to decipher.
Trie- Mayor flatly refused him the ap
pointment and explaining his refusal
later said that such a proposition had
too much the semblance of a direct
: bribe to a legislator to influence legis
lation in which he was personally anl
.officially interested. It did not Jibe with
his spnw of honor at any rate, no mat
ter how it appealed to the unique brand
: . of that quality that Johnson claims for
his own. His refusal was a flat one.
> but Grovel came back on the r> bound
and asked again and again did allu
sions to Assembly bill 611 and the prob
. ability of its passage form no inconsid
erable portion of his conversation.
Mayor Land, however, merely re- j
nett for United States Senator to-day
and for Nathan Cole Jr., Silver Re
publican, to-morrow.
The indiscriminate use of names for
an empty honor led to an important dis
cussion. Even among the Democrats
a complimentary vote foT United States
Senator has been cheapened and As
semblyman Burnett introduced a reso
lution binding the Democratic members
to vote for William R. Hearst for
United States Senator for the rest of
the session. Burnett is now sorry that
he spoke. He said nice things of Wil
liam, but every compliment was met
with venomous denunciation in which
more than one member took a whack at
William and then returned to the at
tack.
R. Porter Ashe took the center of the
stage of oratorical abuse. He asked
his associates to believe that he had
some self-respect left, and in justifica
tion of that self-respect he declined to
vote for William R. Hearst for any
thing that in any way is remotely con
nected with honor. Mr. Ashe begged
his fellow-Democrats to remember that
the position of United States Senator
is one of national honor, and that it was
shameful even to associate the name of
Hearst with it, even in a compli
mentary way. But Mr. Ashe had only
begun. He reminded his associates
that they have other interests than
their own to protect. For the time be
ing they are custodians of the welfare
of the Democracy of the State, and Mr.
Ashe said he could conceive of no more
outrageous act of party treachery than
to saddle the Democracy with the
weight of William R. Hearst as a I
standing aspirant for Senatorial hon
ore. With the name of Hearst the Re- j
publicans would have a bludgeon far
more deadly with which to beat the I
Democracy to death than the Demo- j
crats have possessed in their warfare \
upon the Republicans with the name of
De Young.
Mr. Ashe became even more serious. J
He called attention to the fact that if
the Democratic minority were to vote
for Hearst for the remainder of the |
peated his positive refusal, and since
that day, as Land predicted, no word
has come from Johnson concerning it.
It has been sleeping quietly on the
second reading file and no oratory has
come out of Johnson to awaken It. de
spite that his own measures and thosÂ»o
who have done him legislative favors
are now either in the hands of the Sen
ate or about to be sent there.
When the job that Assembly bill 611
i was to create slipped through his fin
gers his interest in the bill went with
it, and Mayor Land is decidedly warm
over it. He says the bill is one of vital
importance to himself personally and
to the people of Sacramento, and he re
sents Johnson's attempt to use the
knife on the people who have placed
1 him in office.
"Johnson did apply to me Tor the po
sition," he said to-day, "Out I had al
ready practically made the appoint
ment. If I had not I could not have
appointed Mr. Johnson. It would have
I beenâ well, an indelicate thing: at least
| for me to do. What a position it would
j have placed me in. lam personally in
j terested in these bonds, and we want
I the matter settled. Mr. Johnson asrreed
: to introduce the bill and warmly sup
! ported it at first, but, say, this is a deli
â¢ cate matter, and I had rather not be
interviewed concerning it."
"Have you heard of the bill since you
! refused Grove the Job, Mayor?"
"Well, we cannot learn just what has
become of it," he smilingly admitted,
and the clang of the gong for the bell
boy closed the interview.
SENATORS WASTE TIME
TRYING TO SAVE IT
Much Useless Discussion Over
the Rales â More Business
Than Patriotism.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â The Senate sat to-day
from the usual hour in the morning un- \
til the usual hour at night, but what good j
a great part of the session did Is hard to j
understand. The morning hours were I
taken up with a debate on rules to ex- j
pedlte business and suspending rules to
control business. Had the hours of this
! morning been the only ones so devoted It
would be all right, but so soon as the
Senate considers a rule to save time it
; at once proceeds to waste all the time
the rule would save, and so Is again at
I the starting point. Discussions on rules
j take more time than the discussions on
j bills'â three times as much, measure for
! measure, and next to baiting the press \
I and voting "aye" the Senators' tastes I
! tend toward debating rules for saving '
! time.
The Committee on Rules first submitted j
Senator Curtin's resolution, that on
: March 4 the Senate adjourn. The Senate j
hopes to finish by March 4. but the Sen
; ators fear the limit. The resolution wa*
; laid on the table.
The report of the Committee on Con- j
tested Elections, or at least that part of !
it which related to attorneys' fees in the i
Dennery-Ashe contest, came -up/ Rule 34!
forbids the allowance of any more than I
$300 for attorneys' fees in any election '
contest. The report of the committee al
lowed KWO to each side, or $600. and so Ihe |
question came up on a motion to suspend i
the rules to pass the claim.
There was an hour's argument, in I
; which each Senator who spoke depre- j
i cated the loss of time, and then when it
I came to a vote there were two votes still |
i lacking from the necessary twenty-seven.
j 5L call of the house was ordered, but while
It was in progress the twenty-seven wero
made up and the attorneys' fees were al
lowed. They are: Dennery's counsel. F. i
i H. Powers, $150- E. F. Bert. $150; Ashe's
counsel, H. H. McPike, 5100; A. S: New
burg. $100; F. J. Heney, $100.
The special urgency file is always a
good suoject for talk on rules, and as
things were running rulewlse this morn
ing that unfortunate piece of legislation
had to come forward. It was suggested
by the Committee on Rules that the ur
gency file be taken up Just after the read
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1899.
I session, the action would have a far
reaching significance. People generally
as well as partisans would believe that
Hearst was put forward as a candidate
to be elected two years from now and
the result to the State Democracy
would be as disastrous as William's
journalistic campaign in Cuba,
Mr. Ashe ceased in his oratorical ti- \
rade.
Assemblyman Burnett was gasping j
up against the wall but ventured mildly
to say that Mr. Hearst had been de- '
nounced upon the floor of the Senate.
Mr. Ashe replied that it was not nec
essary to bind up the lacerations of
William's cuticle by damning the j
Democracy of California as long as j
people could remember the yellow gold.
Assemblyman Burnett's motion was |
overwhelmingly lost and the Demo- j
cratic minority will continue to vote as
It pleases.
Senator Ashe, by his action, has jeop- |
ardized not only some of his political
and official friends, but some of those j
with whom he has held the most cordial
social relations. There are several
worthy members of the Senate and the ;
Assembly that have been waiting with
the patience of martyrs to get a swipe \
at William. They would pawn their po- ;
litical life to get just one chance at the !
yellow god and tell whoever would lis- i
ten to them what they think of him.
And now Ashe has destroyed their op- â¢
portunity by preventing the Democrats
from presenting William's name as a i
candidate for United States Senator.
During the caucus this morning a
resolution pledging .the members not to ;
vote for a Republican for United States
Senator was adopted. Several members
were not present, however, at the time,
and the resolution in consequence is not
binding upon them. After the nerve
racking incidents that followed- the
suggestion of Hearst as a Senatorial
possibility, many members sought the
relief of fresh air. And there seems
now to be very little weeping even
among the worshipers at the discovery
that William, as a Democratic god, had j
feet of clay.
ing of the journal and its consideration
continued until the noon adjournment,
and when it has been run through that
another be formed "beginning with the
other end of the alphabet. It waa fur
ther suggested that at other times the
Senate third reading file be considered.
This was food for more discussion, in
which the Senate reveled until it grew
tired, and then some one moved to lay
the matter on the table, and it promptly
â¢joined Curtin's March 4 adjournment.
N-Â«r was this all. Senator Curtin sub
mitted an amendment to rule 34 to make
it allow attorneys' fees and expenses,
with no saving restriction. But the hour
was late, the subject of rules had grown
tiresome and the amendment was re
ferred to the Committee on Rules, where
it will be until it can furnish diversion
for. another morning session. This left
five minutes for the consideration of the
file. The title of one bill was read and
then the Senate adjourned for joint bal
lot. It had been a pleasant if uot a pro
fitable morning's session.
Senator Flint submitted a bill, by unan
imous consent of the Senators, allowing
the Native Sons to use the design of the
great seal of the State for medals to be
presented to those who were in active
service during the war with Spain. The
bill also provides that the Governor shall
appoint three commissioners to act with
the grand officers of the Native Sons to
regulate the preparation of the medals
and their proper presentation.
An invitation was received from the As
sembly to the Senate, Inviting the Sena
tors to come to the Assembly chamber
and listen to honeyed words from As
semblymen Caminetti and Johnson on
Washington. The anomaly of Assem
blyman Johnson rising in public to speak
of the Father of his Country evoked no
smile. ,
It' was moved and seconded and car
ried that the Assembly be asked to add
the name of Senator Shortridge to the
list of orators, and having thus raised
the hopes of the Senator from Santa
Clara the Senate proceeded to rob him of
half his audience by declining the invita
tion. The Senate was too busy was the
excuse. There are more suggestions on
rules to be considered.
Assembly bill 261. submitted by Dibble
and amending the Penal Code so as to
prohibit the unauthorized wearing: of but
tons of secret societies, was passed.
Assembly bill 528. an act to provide a
special fund for the payment of teachers'
salaries, was passed.
Senator Smith's bill to establish a poly
technic school in San Luis Obispo County
and providing an appropriation of $100,000
for the purchase of a site and the erection
of a suitable building and apparatus was
passed by the Senate. The bill also pro
vides for the appointment by the Gover
nor of a board of trustees of five mem
ber? to govern the school.
SUPERIOR JUDGES GET
A RAISE IN SALARY
BAL.T. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â Assemblyman Dibble
wound up two weeks of hard fighting to
day by pushing Senate bill 56, by Curtin,
through on Its final passage in the Assem
bly with more votes than he needed to
his credit.
Senate bill 56 provides for a rniso of JlOflQ
per annum in the salaries of the Superior
Judges of San Francisco, Tuolumne and
Shasta counties, and probably no meas
ure that has come into the Assembly has
met with more or stronger opposition.
The country repreSentatires were
against it for the reason that their coun
ties were not In on the deal and because
of pledges of economy made at home they
could not get them in.
Melick pulled figures on Judge Dibble to
prove that country Judges did more work
and got le?s money than the jurists in the
city, and Belshaw of Contra Costa want
ed to prove the same thing. Johnson
who was backing the bill at first, got mud
at McDonald of Tuolumne, who was alsh
interested, and vented his spite by get
ting up and ripping out a speech against
the proposition. He did no harm, how
ever. Belshaw offered an amendment put
ting Contra Costa on the list, but it was
voted down, and he withdrew it when
Dibble demanded to know If he had in
troduced it in good faith. Radcliff of
Santa Cruz and Cobb of San Francisco
backed Dibble strongly and the San Fran
cisco delegation spread itself over the
floor and worked on every one who stood
out.
When It came to a vote it pot almost a
dozen more than it needed, though a caii
of the House was necessary to accom
plish It.
ONE MORE BALLOT
AND NO CHANGE
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAC
MENTO, Feb. 22.â After the tak
ing of one ballot for United States
Senator Judge Dibble moved that
a second ballot be taken. He said
he understood that two or three
more Democrats were going over
to John Rosenfeld, and he wanted
to give them a chance. The mo
tion to adjourn shut out Dibble's
motion.
There was absolutely no change
in the Republican end of the bal
lot. The Democrats, however, split
between four candidatesâAssem
blyman James J. Burnett. John
Rosenfeld. James D. Phelan and
Stephen M. White.
The ballot was as follows:

ANTI-CARTOON
BILL GETS ITS
DEATH BLOW
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â The pet anti-cartoon
measure of young Mr. Works of San Di
ego, the bill to prevent the promulgation
of unlovely features, came up for final
passage before the Senate this afternoon
and it received its quietus.
It is not thoroughly dead. Like a newly
killed snake, it has still a squirm, a no
tice of a motion to reconsider the vote
which failed. That will be considered
to-morrow, and unless some Senators ex
perience a sudden and complete change
of heart the bill will receive a second
and final whack between the eyes.
There was not so much oratory over
the measure as appeared when it came
up for second reading. Every one had
had his say except Senator Shortridge,
who could not restrain his desire to give
the bill a final kick. Senator Shortridge
repeated his arguments of last Monday â
that the bill in restricting the expression
of opinion by pictures was doing precise
ly the same thing as restricting the ex
pression of opinion by printed words, and
this, he declared, was in direct violation
of that provision of the constitution
which says that must not be done. He
referred to the power of the press as
manifested in the wrongs it has righted,
the schemes it has exposed, the corrup
tion it has prevented by Its fearless ex
posure of methods and In its influence
toward education and progress. Because
it sometimes overstepped the bounds, he
denied the Senate had a right to tie its
hands. The excess could be punished by
the laws of libel already on the statute
books, he said, but the liberty of the
press could not be abridged.
Senator Rowell believed the bill would
be benefited by striking out the prohibi
tion against portraits, but he did not think
it worth while to offer his suggestion in
the form of an amendment. There was
no further discussion, and the bill went
immediately to a vote on roll call. Sen
ator Chapman announced that he was in
favor of the bill and he had agreed to
pair his vote with that of Senator. Sims,
who was absent and opposed to it. The
roll call proceeded and then the absentees
were calledâ those who were really ab
sent and those who hoped to escape tha
responsibility of "aye" and "no" by re
maining silent, in the expectation that the
bill would be passed or refused passage.
When everybody had been dragged Into
the light the vote was as follows: ; r--.
Ayesâ Bettman, Burnett, Curtln,
Cutter, Dickinson, Feeney, Hall, Leayitt,,
Maggard. Morehouse. Nutt. Pace, Simp*
son, Taylor. Tfout and Wolfeâ l7. '

A call of the House was demanded, and
on ayes and noes the chair decided against
the call. Cries for a roll call on the call
of the House were beard and on the roll
being called the motion for a call of the
House was found to have been lost. -
Before the vote was announced. Cutter
changed his vote from no to aye and not
hearing" Cutter and fearing some one had
forgotten to provide for a reconsideration,
Morehouse: asked permission to do v the
same. He withdrew his request when he
heard Cutter had changed, and then when
the vote was announced Senator Cutter
gave notice that to-morrow ha would
move to reconsider.

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â At rollcall at 9:30
o'clock this morning there were not
enough lawmakers on hand In the Assem
bly to do business, and on motion of
Dibble a recess was taken until a quarter
after 10 in order that there might be time
to round up the House.
As soon as the House had reconvened
there were a half dozen petitions for
leaves of absence; few who were on hand
were inclined to spend the holiday at
hard work. Assemblymen Greenwell,
Brown and Clarke were granted permis
sion to absent themselves, and the rou
tine of the morning was begun.
The Committee on Irrigation reported
favorably on Milice's Assembly bill 246, to
provide for the organization of persons
owning water which is received and dis
tributed to their lands from the same
source and the same system of works.
The Committee on Hospitals and Asy
lums recommended the passage of As
sembly bill 195, to provide for the erection
and equipment of a commissary building
at the Home for Feeble-minded Children.
Assembly bill 131 for additional accommo
dations at the Home for the Feeble
minded Children and the erection of cot
tage* for epileptic and paralytic persons;
Assembly bill 192 for lighting, heating and
laundry apparatus at the same institu
tion.
Trie Judiciary Committee, which had
under consideration the petition from the
drought-stricken farmers of Northern San
Luis Obispo County for exemption, from
taxation, reported the petition back to
the House without recommendation.
The committee states that under the
constitution no such relief as is asked for
can be given, and it recommends that the
stricken farmers allow their lands to be
sold to the State and trust in the gen
erosity of succeeding Legislatures for
their redemption. "
The Committee on Federal Relations

Senate joint resolution 11, relative to
money due and unpaid to the State of

that there would be a public meeting In
the Assembly chamber thiÃ evening and
that Grove L. Johnson, Assemblyman
Caminettl and Senator Shortridge would
speak at some length in honor of Wash

MAJOR McLAUGHLIN
HAS BEEN DEPOSED
Too Expensive to Suit the Tastes
of the Railroad Cor=
poration.
HERVEY LINDLEY TAKES CHARGE
Burns 1 Campaign to Be Poshed From Now On by the
Smoothest Lobbyist in the Pay of the
Southern Pacific.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 22.â Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin haÃ fallen. For fifty-two
days and fifty-nine ballots he has man
aged the Senatorial fight of Dan Burns,
and those who seek to dishonor Cali
fornia by giving Mexican Dan a seat
in the United States Senate fear that
McLaughlin will not succeed in his
management. These people have deter
mined, therefore, to change managers,
to depose McLaughlin and lift Hervey
Lindley to the vacant throne.
The change is an incident of greatest
significance in the Senatorial campaign,
as it is made at a most critical time,
and means that the Southern Pacific
Company, determined to elect its can
didate, fears that success cannot be
won under the management of Frank
McLaughlin.
It means, also, that the corporation
which employs McLaughlin and con
trols Burns has decided that McLaugh
lin is too expensive a luxury to suit cor
poration tastes and does not render a
service commensurate with his pay.
Hervey Llndiey, the successor of Mc-
Laughlin, is old in the employ of the
railroad, understands the policy of his
employer and is familiar with the
methods necessary to carry out that
policy.
The episode of McLaughlin's man
agement of Burns is interesting. Mc-
Laughlin is chairman of the Republi
can State Central Committee, and in
that capacity has much to do with the
direction of party affairs and the sug
gestion of party candidates. Shortly
before the Legislature convened Mc-
Laughlin took occasion to express his
opinion forcibly on the candidacy of
Dan Burns for United States Senator.
McLaughlin declared that he had heard
that the railroad intended to force Dan
Burns upon the Republican party as a
United States Benator. McLaughlln
declared that this was an jutrage and
altogether too bitter a dose for the
party to swallow. Notwithstanding
these assertions McLaughlin became
and remained until to-day the man
ager of Burns' fight for the United
States Senate. He avowedly accepted
that position, if he did not arrogate it.
as other followers of Burns claim that
the Mexican has no manager and keeps
his secrets to himself. .
McLaughlin has been, however, the
central figure in the Mexican's cam
paign. If he has arrogated what was
not his own hie arrogance has been ac
cepted. He was, to every observer un
til to-day, the manager of Dan Burns.
This management was not satisfactory.
In the first place, although in the re
sult to be achieved of secondary con
sideration, McLaughlin was too expen
sive. The railroad spends money to buy
results, and there was no result except
failure in the management of Dan
Burns' campaign. After fifty-nine bal
lots have been ta}cen and every artifice
known to corrupt politics has been used
Dan Burns has gained only three votes,
each vote stamping upon its giver a
mark of shame. That is not a result
the Southern Pacific Company contem
plates with equanimity.
The corporation began to make very
serious and searching inquiries to de
termine the cause of the failure of their
plans and of the management of Mc-
Laughlin. The affair Is one of moment
to them, as tools in the United States

DEAR DOCTORS: Having 'read a great many testimonials In praise of your wonderful

I had been a sufferer from Nervous Exhaustion. Nervous Debility and "Weakness for a
number of years, but, thanks ,to Hudyan. 1 am - now perfectly well. I do not know how
many different remedies I used, but whenever. I heard 'of one .that was advertised to cure
complaints similar to ! mine I gave it a thorough trial. Doctors could do me no good either.
"I consulted with a number of them, and they all told me that my ailments were, rather
trivia and that a cure could be readily effected, but they all failed. My sufferings at all
times were intense. : I never felt rested, had no ambition to do anything and felt that my life
'was a. useless one. I could not even attend to my household' duties, which were very slight,
-because of my becoming so easily, tired. I was absolutely without energy. At nights I would
toss about the bed and would often- get up and try â¢to make myself sleepy by reading. 1
always awoke -in the morning feeling miserable. My back would ache, my limbs would be
.tired and my eyes would look red and swollen. Despite the fact that I used numerous
remedies, I was growing steadily worse, and think that I would have continued to do so had
I not become Informed of the wonderful .results of Hgdyan In nervous cases.- I had not used
It long before I experienced relief, and I am now perfectly well in every particular.

f Senate are not only expensive, but diffl
! cult to obtain.
The investigation of the railroad
agents was fruitful. It was found that
i Mclaughlin was not giving his undi
j vided attention to the Senatorial fight.
I He was seen day after day interesting
1 himself in other legislation.
The Southern Pacific Company balked
at this condition of affairs and Mc-
Laughlin has been deposed. Hervey
Lindley will now assume the manage
ment of the Mexican's campaign and
conduct it on lines that were over
looked by McLaughlin. Hervey Lind
ley is first cousin to Colonel Mazuma
and possesses all the family secrets.
Lindley has been for years the recog
| nized agent, lobbyist and representa
j tive of the railroad in the southern part
!of the State. His headquarters are at
! Los Angeles, but his political and cor
ruptionist division extends all over the
State. In matters of moment, in af
fairs requiring a delicate manipulation
and the presentation of ringing argu
ments Hervey Lindley has few equals.
He has therefore been chosen to handle
the Mexican's fight. In a matter of
such grave importance it was not to
â  be expected that the employers of Lind
j ley would ask him to assume all the
! complex obligations of the trust they
! have imposed upon him. There are
! great schemes to be concocted and de-
I tails to be carried out.
Hervey Lindley cannot do both, and
i to his brother, Al Lindley, has been as
signed the duty of attending to the de
tails of the management. These de
tails are also delicate in their nature.
i One may make the general outline of
negotiation, but some one else must
â  carry out the incidents. This duty Al
j Lindley will accept, as he is qualified by
j nature, it is said, to see in the dark.
He is now in the office of the Secretary'
! of State, but will have ample opportun
; ity to assume his new obligations.
This affair has created a great deal of
comment. It is looked upon as the be
ginning of the end of the unwarranted
ambition of D. M. Burns to disgrace
this State as Its representative in the
â¢ United States Senate. The change of
managers at this critical time in the
struggle is a confession more eloquent
than a spoken avowal that the fight is
lost.
It was to be expected that Major Mc-
Laughlin would deny this important
incident in Burns' campaign, and in his
denial this is what he says:
"The first intimation I had of this
matter was when a Call representative
called on me this evening. I then stated
and now state that there is not the
slightest foundation of truth in the
story; that I am still managing Colonel
Burns' senatorial campaign and will re
main in his fight in the capacity of his
friend and chief adviser until he is
elected United States Senator."
The other politicians interested in the
affair are, as a matter of course, se
! cretive. In business such as this, where
there is involved the manipulation of
public men. silence on the part of the
â¢ manipulators is the only argument.
The new management by Hervey
Lindley has been so conspicuous as to
â  be noticeable to every observer in the
] last few days. Lindley has outclassed
McLaughlin in boldness, indicating in
his actions his realization that desper
| ate. measures are necessary to win the
fight for Burns. McLaughlin, in a dis
cussion subsequent to his formal denial
of the truth of the change of rna.nage
ment, laid stress particularly upon the
fact that the change will injure the
fight of Burns.

DAYS OF ALGERISM
IN WAR DEPARTMENT
ARE NOW NUMBERED
It Is Believed the Secretary Will
Soon Retire and Army Reor
ganization Will Proceed.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â The Herald's !
Washington correspondent sends the j
following: The days of Algerism in the j
War Department are numbered. The |
resignation of Russell A. Alger, volun- ;
tary or by request of the President, will
occur within a fortnight. President I
McKinley has practically made up his ,
mind as to the Secretary's successor.
These positive statements were made
to me to-day by a gentleman usually
informed, and subsequently admitted
as a probability by a Cabinet member
who has talked with the President con
fidentially on the suljject.
Secretary Alger is In Detroit. It is !
believed he is making plans for return- j
ing there and resuming his old busi
ness engagements. He is expected to
return iiere on Friday and it is not un- ]
likely his resignation and the appoint- \
ment of his successor may be formally â 
announced by that time.
Secretary Alger's contemplated jun- |
ket to Cuba and Porto Rico, I am told, j
is off. This is one of the reasons for j
believing his resignation is tv occur im
mediately. I am told by one of his |
close personal friends that he had made ]
up his mind some days ago to make an
extensive tour of Cuba and Porto Rico
to submit a report to the President, and !
then resign from the Cabinet on the
ground of ill health. His idea was that
he could retire without suspicion that
he was forced to do so under fire. This
same gentleman informed me to-night
that the Secretary had practically de
termlned to abandon his inspection trip,
but for what reason he did not seem
to know or rather was unwilling fo ad- ',
mit. Invitations issued to members of
the military committees and their fam-
Hies still hold good, but if the Secretary i
does not go himself it is probable the
trip will be abandoned entirely.
In spite of statements to the contrary
It can be positively asserted that the
relations between the President and
Secretary Alper are decidedly strained. '
President McKinley has felt for a long j
time the serious embarrassment to the !
success of his administration caused by ,
Alger's mismanagement of the Wai-
Department, and his close political
friends have advised him once, more \
than once, to find some way of getting ,
a new Secretary of War. Finding that

with Jose L. Vito as secretary and Juan
Uorento president of the council.
When Aguinaldo Teamed of their suc
cess in ousting Spanish authority he
sent his congratulations to them and
also copies of the form of government
which he proposed to establish in Ne
gros. similar in nature to the principle ,
of the government of Luzon and sub
servlent to it.
The leaders of the Negros revolution
did not approve of Aguinaldo's sugges- ,
tions and they asked Captain Glass of j
the United States cruiser Charleston
for the protection of America. Captain
Glass promised to forward their com
munication to America.
Meanwhile the government has been
working smoothly, and the island has
been peaceful. Hearing of the fall of
Iloilo and fearing similar destruction .
of the principal towns of Negros should '
Aguinaldo's soldiers land on the island,
they sent a deputation to General Mil- |
ler at Iloilo, asking for a definite ans- f
wer to their application for American
protection. General Miller replied fa- j
vorably, and the deputation returned to !
Negros. The American flag was hoisted j
over the town of Bacolod in the pres
ence of the entire population, and na- j
tive troops saluted the Stars and '
Stripes with twenty-one guns. This
imposing ceremony took place on Feb- j
ruary 18. The deputation then returned
to Iloilo and came to this city.
The present form of government in |
NegroÃ is similar to that of the Swiss
confederation, the island being sub- I
divided into one canton and two prov- <
inces. The members of the deputation j
were asked: "What do you expect un- j
der United States rule?"
They replied: "We put ourselves un- ;
reservedly in the hands of the Ameri
cans. We trust them to establish a
form of government suitable to the
island. We cannot guarantee anything
as to the line of action the other islands ;
will take, but we will co-operate with j
the Americans and use our influence to
induce the remainder of the Visayan
Islands to come under the American
flag."
The delegation made an offer to Gen- j
eral Otis to furnish 100,000 native troops
for the American army.
The area of the island is about two
million arres, and the population about
two million five hundred thousand.
There are two races of people in the
islands, the inland savages and an
outer fringe of rich and peaceful sugar
planters.
REED ROASTED BY
GENERAL SHAFTER
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22.â General
Shafter, who was a guest of the Com
mercial Club at the annual Washing
ton banquet to-night, in conversation
with Congressman-elect R. J. "Waters
said this morning:
"I have been a hot Republican all my
life and I think that Speaker Reed
showed exceedingly poor taMe and very
little courtesy by his recent actions in
working against the President. In my
opinion, if there is an extra session of
Congress a part of its work will be the
election of a new Speaker of the House.
Reed has grown very rabid of late and
at present is suffering with a swelled
head. When any man gets to that
point in his career he is lost. Reed is,
to say the least, acting very unwisely,
War Commission emphasized the de
mand for the relief of the War Secre
tary, the President has found a way of
impressing upon that official the de
sirability of his early retirement.
While the report of the War Com
mission In one instance pointed out the
inefficiency of the head of the War De- !
partment I have reliable information '
that several members of the committee, j
talking with the President privately !
and individually, made the case against j
Secretary Alg-er much stronger than re
ported in the formal finding's of the
board. The President made a mental
note >>f these observations and indicated |
to at least one member of the board |
that he appreciated the full significance
of their private statements, and that in
the near future they would not go un
heeded.
By many of those who were interested
in the enactment of an army reor
ganization bill at this session it is I
earnestly hoped the formal announce- I
ment o-f Secretary Alger's retirement i
from the Cabinet will be made before
the -end of the week. It is fully appre
ciated that the opposition to the pend
ing bill is as much due to disgust at
Algerism as to political motives. With
the certainty that there is to be a new
Secretary of War capable of carrying j
out the will of Congress for proper |
reorganization of the army there is lit- !
tie doubt that much of the opposition j
to the pending measure will subside.
It is believed the President is not un- |
influenced by the trend of the testimony j
at present being given by officers of the
army before the court of inquiry inves
tigating the charges made by Major
General Miles as to the bad quality of
beef supplied to the army.
Secretary Alger did everything pos
sible to discredit General Miles and de- |
fend the beef, and now that an official
inquiry is being made into the matter
witness after witness comes forward
and tells of the nauseating and un
wholesome character of the canned
roast beef.
When the court of inquiry was or
dered the issue, in the popular mind,
was between the War Department and
General Miles. There is no doubt that j
it was the determination of the War !
Department to find ground If possible j
for* the removal of General Miles. In
stead of this the general will apparently !
be sustained in every charge he made,
and the popular sense of justice can
be satisfied only by the dismissal of
Secretary Alger.

j the country at the outbreak of the re
cent war who had a suspicion of the
complications which have resulted from
j it. No one could foresee the present
Philippine trouble, but nearly every
j person in the country was anxious for
i the conflict. Now its results should be
taken as the natural outcome of the
i war. The idea that â  the Filipinos be
j permitted to establish a government of
! their own is ridiculous. Much as we
I may dislike it, it is the duty of the
â¢ Government to pursue the policy al-
I ready adopted relative to these islands.
; Supposing we were to let the natives
try a government of their own mak
ing, It would be only a short while
until Germany, France, England and
other European countries would have
the islands divided among themselves;
this would be just as long as it would
i take them to split them up."
This conversation occurred in the
j presence of two members of his staff
and several other persons.
NAVAL APPROPRIATION
BILL ON ARGUMENT
But the House Pauses Long Enough j
for the Beading of Washington's
Farewell Address.
WASHINGTON,' Feb. 22.â The House
inaugurated the custom which has pre
vailed for many years in the Senate of
listening to the reading of Washington's
farewell address on Washington's birth
day. The address was read at the re-
Quest of Bailey of Texas, the Democratic
leader.
Two hours were devoted to the naval
appropriation bill, but seemingly only
the threshold of the debate upon the cost
of armor plate has been passed. Bou
telle's amendment fixing the maximum
prices of armor plate at $545 per ton, but
restricting the provision to the appropria
tion made in the present bill, was ruled
to be In order, whereupon another propo
sition was offered by Underwood of Ala
bama for the erection of an armor-plate
plant by the Government. A point of or
der against the latter proposition waa
pending when the consideration of the
naval bill was suspended to allow nem
bers of the House to pay tribute to the
memory of the late Senator Morrill of
Vermont.

BEEF-PACKERS WILL
BE GIVEN A HEARING
Court of Inquiry to Permit Army Con
tractors to Have a Voice in the
"Bad Meat" Investigation.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â T0-day's
proceedings of the Court of Inauiry in
vestigating the beef controversy devel
oped little that was new. The testi
mony, with the exception of that of Dr.
Daly, surgeon on the staff of General
Miles during the war, and of Colonel
Woodruff, assistant commissary gen
eral, was generally in line with that
of yesterday. The canned roast beef
was generally condemned as unsatis
factory, while the refrigerated beef was
commended, the chief complaint being
that it often decomposed en route to
camp.
The testimony of representatives of
the Subsistence Department was be
gun, that of Colonel Woodruff, assist
ant commissary general, being the
most notable. He purchased more than
800,000 pounds of canned beef and told
of the method of purchase and the rea
sons that prompted it. He took issue
with General Miles' contention that
beef on the hoof was the usual source
of fresh meat supply to the .army.
Another feature of the day was the
introduction of Dr. Daly, who charged
before the War Commission that re
frigerated beef at Chlckamauga. Jack
sonville, Tampa and in Porto Rico had
been treated chemically. He was not
examined, however, in regard to this
charge, Colonel Davis announcing that
the contractors who were attacked
were entitled to be notified of the ex
amination upon this point that they
might have ample time in which to
appear should they decide to do so. The
law required this, he said. According
ly Dr. Daly was excused after a par
tial examination and will be recalled
later. The investigation will proceed
to-morrow, when General Eagan. for
mer commissary general, is expected
to appear and tell the story of the beef
supply as viewed by this department.
When the Court of Inquiry met this
morning Colonel Davis, the recorder, an
nounced that the examination of wit
nesses so far summoned and reported was
about concluded. The court should con
sider now, he thought, the questions of
further summons and procedure, and, at
his suggestion, the tribunal went into se
cret session.
When the executive session was con

geon of volun
teers during the
war, and testi
fied before the
rommisslon that
he had discov
ered by chemical
analysis boracic
and salicylic acid

His examination by the recorder was con
ducted slowly and with great care, de
veloping with minuteness all of Dr
Daly's duties while attached to ueneral
Miles' staff. These, besides those of an
a*-mv surgeon, consisted in making spe
cial reports to General Miles on camp
sites, water supply and the like. The re
corder very carefully developed the fact
that most of these reports were verbal
or telegraphic, therein differing from the
now famous meat report which was the
cause of Daly being summoned as a wit
n< Dr" Daly testified that he was assigned
to duty on the staff of General Miles and
Â,! at Tampa until a few days
after the Shafter expedition sailed, his
duties being of a miscellaneous charac
ter under direction of the army medical
department. Thence he went to Key
WeÂ«t Miami and other points to study
proposed camp sites. Later he came
north and finally joined General Miles at
Guanlca, Porto Rico, sailing from
Charleston subsequent to the latter s de
parture. His duties, he said, were those
of attending surgeon at headquarters and
the general duties incident to surgical
and medical needs of the army.

CHINESE CAN GO
BACK TO HAWAII
Right of Those Who Left
Before Annexation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â Solicitor
General J. K. Richards has rendered
an opinion, which has been approved
by the Attorney General, in which he
holds that the Secretary of the Treas
ury has authority to admit to the Ha
waiian Islands auch Chinese persons as
departed therefrom under the regula
tions of the existing government allow
ing them to return, but who would be
excluded by the extension to the islands
of the laws and regulations now opera
tive within the United States.
After reviewing the history of the
legislation and the decisions of the
courts on the subject the Surveyor
General says in part:
An alien resident is not an alien immi
grant. Under. our alien immigration acts
It has been held that an alien who has re
sided in this country without becoming
naturalized and who departs with the in
tention of returning is not to be deemed
an immigrant .upon his return, although
he was an alien immigrant when he first
entered the country.
Applying this wholesome doctrine to the
cases submitted, the Chinese who, under
the former government of the Hawaiian
Islands, became domiciled in the Islands,
acquired certain rights, among which was
the right to leave the islands for a tem
porary purpose and return. It is not to
be presumed that Congress, which recog
nizes the right of such Chinese to be and
remain in the Islands, intended to inter
fere with the Incidental right of return
ing to the islands after a temporary ab
sence. Chinese laborers have been for
years absolutely prohibited from coming
into the United States; yet all the time
we have permitted and now permit the
Chinese laborers lawfully within the
United States to leave this country for a
temporary purpose and return.
Accordingly, in view of the manifest in
justice of interfering with a right Inci
dental to lawful residence in the islands,
the words "no further immigration"
should be construed bo as to apply only
to actual additional immigration into the
islands, namely, the coming of Chinese
into the islands for the first time after
annexation, and not to the return to the
islands of Chinese who have a lawful
residence there and are simply exercising
the recognized right of returning, after a
temporary absence, to their business and
their homes.
Fresno Pioneer Oone.
FRESNO. Feb. 22.â John Furguson, one
of the pioneers of the county, died sud
denly this afternoon while being brought
to .this city for medical treatment. An
inquest was held and the Jury returned
a verdict of death from natural causes.
source and character of his orders, evi
dently with a view to the bearing these
developments might have upon the wit
ness' analysis and report upon beef.
Dr. Daly said he remained In Porto
Rico five or six days after General Miles
departed, being ordered to supervise the
preparation of the transport Panama for
bringing: convalescents north In a man
ner above repoach. This was because
there had been previously considerable
complaint as to the outlining of return
ing transports. He received these orders
about August 23, and after picking up a
load of sick at various points in Porto
Rico sailed on September 5 and arrived at
Fort Monroe September 10, landing
his patients in a greatly improved condi
tion. He reported to Washington, where
he was quite 111, and was given sick leave.
The surgeon general was pleased with his
work on the Panama and wished him to
remain there. While still sick in Pitts
burg he received orders from General
Miles to go on an Inspection tour of the
new regiments in the South, who were
being fitted out for tropic service.
This was the trip on which witness be
came acquainted with the alleged "em
balmed beef." There were several officers
engaged in this inspection. Dr. Daly's In
vestigation was directed, among other
things, particularly toward the food sup
ply and cooking arrangements of the regi
ments. The general object of the inspec
tion, according to the witness, was to get
the troops into the best possible condition
for active service and to render assist
ance and instruction wherever it was
needed.
Prior to leaving the stand, however. Dr.
Daly was examined in regard to the Pow
ell experiment with beef preservation at
Tampa, Colonel Davis pointing out that
it was merely experimental and that no
contractor was involved.
Dn. Daly said J. F. Weston called his
attention to a quarter of beef which was
hanging on board
ship. Weston said
It had been sixty
hours In the open
air, and that he
â was waiting to
see what would
eventuate. Dr.
Daly did not re
call anything of
Coloijpl Weston's
statement indi
cating that the beef was other than a
part of the general supply, or that it had
been treated with a chemical as an ex
periment. He noticed that flies would not
remain on the beef and that no larvae
were deposited. He thought that strange,
and that the beef would not putrefy in
the Tampa air after sixty hours' expos
ure. The witness finally cut a piece from
the beef and later cooked and ate it. Aft
er riding on horseback he became nau
seated. He did not suspect preservatives
on the beef, although his taste suggested
an experience he had with antelope some
years before while hunting. Nevertheless,
Dr. Daly said, he spoke to no one about
the matter.
The witness wanted It made plain that
Colonel Weston had said nothing about
the quarter of beef being experimental,
and he had no reason to suspect the Gov
ernment was conducting an experiment as
to the efficacy of any chemical preserva
tive.
In all of Dr. Daly's detailed recital the
question of beef was not once broached
by the >^ourt, but when the witness had
been chronologically carried through his
term of office the recorder handed him
the famous "embalmed beef report," and
asked if he recognized it. Dr. Daly said
that he did, and that it was all right ex
cept, perhaps, the date, which in the
copy was September 21. He said, to the
best of his recollection, the exact date
was October 14. The date, however, he
said, was not essential, the report being
genuine and, in the opinion of Dr. Daly,
perfectly accurate.
Colonel Davis then addressed the court
briefly, saying that it was only within
twenty-four hours that he had been able
personally to study this report of Dr.
Dafy and he found therein certain alle
gations against certain persons who had
made contracts for supplying food ma
terial to the Government. To continue
the examination of the witness on this
subject In the absence of those persons
against whom his charges were directed
would be to deprive them of rights ac
corded them by law. He therefore sug
gested that the other parties interestedâ
the meat contractorsâ should be given
reasonable notice of the proceedings and

Thirty Thousand Guests
Present.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLOVERDALE, Feb. 22.â The red
letter day of the citrus fair has come
and gone and the people of Cloverdale j
are congratulating themselves on the :
success they have achieved. Thirty !
thousand people came to town, one ;
train in two sections bringing thirty |
carloads of visitors. This was "Sonoma j
Day," and it seemed as though the en- I
tire population of the county tried to
be present to participate in the festivl
ties. The weather could not have been j
Improved upon. The mercury ascended
until it reached the 85th degree and j
there was not a breath of air stirring. I
In the big pavilion the exhibits, ff%sh- ;
ened during the preceding night, af- j
forded as brilliant a spectacle as tfcey j
did on the opening day of the fair. ;
Such of the decorations as had faded
had been replaced, and when the elec
tric lights shone on the scene at night
the interior of the pavilion afforded a
spectacle that delighted the eye and
won praise from the lips of all who
entered.
There were many amusements to en
tertain the throng of visitors. In the
afternoon there was a balloon ascen
sion, which was made unusually inter
esting by the clarity of the atmosphere,
which enabled the spectators to see
distinctly every move of the daring
aeronaut, even after he had ascended
to a great height. The Santa Rosa
Glee Club gave vocal selections during
the afternoon and evening and the
Cloverdale Band repeated the concerts
j that have been such a delightful fea

As this was the last day of the fair
all the business houses were closed, and

the thousands of visitors in seeking
recreation and pleasure. The fair closed
this evening with a ball under the
auspices of the Cloverdale Band.

that the witness be excused, subject to
recall, when the examination could be
continued with the other Interested par
ties present.
Lieutenant Cole of the Sixth Cavalry,
who was aboard the Rio Grande, which
carried General Sumner's headquarters
and the four experimental quarters of
beef to Cuba, was. much clearer in his
recollection of the beef quarters than
Captain Beckman. It was, he said, from
"some firm of meat packers," and was
sent expressly for experimental use by
the soldiers, with the knowledge that it
was chemically prepared. The beef lasted
only three days, after which it decayed
ancf was thrown overboard. Some of It
was cooked before it spoiled. Witness
saw the piece cooked, but did not eat
it. It looked well, and the men who
tasted it said it was all right.
Lieutenant Colonel H. H. Humphreys,
Twenty-second Infantry, said canned
roast beef was issued to his command in
small quantities prior to the surrender of
Santiago, but he hivd heard then no com
plaints about It. When refrigerated beef
was furnished it was at first satisfactory,
but it spoiled in large quantities, and the
men finally ceased to care for It. The
canned roast beef was then used in a stew,
but the men would not eat it. Witness did
not know why. He attempted to eat the
beef from the can. It did not taste right.
It gagged him. He gave It up.
Brigadier General J. G. Kent, who com
manded a division in the Santiago cam
paign, said complaints of the canned roast
beef came from the men It seemingly
nauseated them, but he took no action,
considering these complaints unavoidable
incidents of the campaign. He understood
much of the refrigerated beef spoiled en
route from the docks to the troops, be
cause of the delay Incident to transport
ing it. General Kent, replying to Gen
eral Davis, said beef on the hoof would
have been preferable to refrigerated
beef, but he doubted very much the prac
ticability of the live cattle supply about
Santiago.
Colonel Charles M. Woodruff, assistant
commissary general and United States
army purchasing
I and depot
llssary at
â nors Island,
York, who
jromlnent in
supply pur
s, testified
he bought a
of $2,256,000
worth of supplies
In the first six
months of the war. He bought between
SOO.OOO and 900,000 pounds of canned roast
beef at a cost ranging from ll 1 /^ cents to
14 cents per pound, according to the size
of cans. Principal dealers would bid
monthly on it, and when he received or
ders to ship canned beef he would sample
the beef In the market, accept and order
it at his discretion. All contracts con
tained clauses providing that contractors
should replace any beef that proved un
fit for use. Each box contained a certifi
cate of inspection and approval from an
official of the Agricultural Department
approving 1 the cattle on hoof and after
slaughter. Most of the beef was shipped
to Tampa. The entire supply In New York
and the entire country, together with
350,000 pounds brought from Europe,
where it had been shipped, was exhaust
ed, and the factories, Colonel Woodruff
understood, were running night and day
to meet the extraordinary demand. Re
plying to Colonel Davis" query. Colonel
Woodruff said he had been familiar with
all campaigns in the past twenty-five
years and never had. beef on the hoof
been used as the fresh meat supply. This
was brought out in response to General
Miles' statement to the contrary. Colonel
Woodruff declared that fresh beef was
secured from contractors, and refriger
ated beef is now practically universally
used. The beef brought back from Eu
rope had been shipped for use in the
French and English armies.
Captain Howell of the Seventh Infan
try said that the canned roast beef was
not palatable, but, he believed, was nu
tritious, and if cooked as a stew would
be satisfactory. The refrigerated beef was
good when not spoiled, and he had not
suspected the use of chemicals.
At the conclusion of Captain Howell's
testimony a can of roast beef that had
been with the troops at Santiago was
opened and examined by the court, being
declared by Captain Howell similar to
that issued during the campaign.

EXTRA SESSION
MAY BE AVOIDED
All Depends Upon the
Army Bill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 22.
There Is still much difference of opin- 1
ion among Congressional leaders as to (
whether circumstances will necessitate
the calling of an extra session. Among
those who called at the White House
to-day the prevailing Impression was |
that an agreement on the army reor
ganization bill would be reached and an !
extra session avoided. The opinion was
general that nothing certain could be
told before Friday or Saturday. The .
condition of legislation on the last of
this week would decide the matter.
Senator Sewell, one of the President's
callers, said:
"All depends upon the army reor
ganization bill. It is absolutely neces
sary that there shall be some legislation
on army matters, for the reason that |
we have a greater war on our hands j
than we had in Cuba. More men and
more arms are opposed to the United
States in the Philippines than in Cuba
during the war with Spain."
Representatives Hopkins and Steele
saw the President during the morning.
Mr. Hopkins said:
"I do rot think there will be an extra
session. Considerable 'bluffing* is being
; indulged in. but this-will give wa> to a
I meeting on common ground and a sat
-1 isfactory army bill probably will be
j passed."
Representative Steele's comment was:
"I think an extra session will be
â¢ averted, and that an agreement on a
I satisfactory army bill will be reached."
Senator Gray said an extra session
I probably would be avoided. The Sena
i tor talked with the President about the
Philippine situation. The President, it
! is said, is satisfied as to the authenticity
of the Philippine circular discovered by
> General Otis, planning a midnight ris-
I ing of natives and the assassination of
the American soldiers at different
points. The President is highly pleased
with the conduct of the Philippine
I campaign by General Otis. Senator
j Gray thinks the Filipinos should be
quickly whipped and later treated with
whatever consideration they deserve.

CESSION OF THE
PHILIPPINES CAUSES
A CRISIS IN SPAIN
Ministers Censured for Endeav
oring to Save the Monarchy
Rather Than the Country.
MADRID, Feb. 22.â The meeting of
the bureau this evening to appoint a
committee to examine the bill for the
cession of the Philippines resulted in
only a nominal Ministerial success.
Although the Ministerial candidates
chosen were four and the opposition
candidates only three, yet on a division
the opposition will muster 92 votes, as
against 87 Ministerialists. The opposi
tion will, therefore, submit a counter
measure.
The Republican motion In favor of
summoning the constituent assembly
led to a stormy debate in the Cham
ber of Deputies. Professor Salmeron,
the Republican leader, in the course of
a violent speech, said vne Republicans
had resumed their seats in Parliament
in order to force the Government to ac
cept its responsibilities. In his opinion,
not only those governing, but the pres
ent institutions themselves, would tail
victims to the present disasters. He se
verely censured the . Ministers for en
deavoring to save the monarchy rather
than the country.
"Your colonial policy," he said, was
disastrous because you joined sword
and cassock in order to restore a feudal
theocracy with all sorts of privileges.
The Government has surrendered to the
United States Spain's whole colonial
'empire, and the peace that has been
signed is the most shameful recorded in
history." , Â ,
ProfessoT Salmeron, after being called
to order for a veiled reference to the
crown, declared that the Conservative
party was primarily responsible for the
country's disasters, since it had failed to
aDDIv in Cuba reforms voted by all par
ties "and that the present Government
must also be held responsible for mak
ing a dishonorable peace. He advocated
calling the constituent assembly, which,
he said would kill forever both Carlism
GOLFERS HAVE
A JOYFUL DAY
An Informal Opening of
New Grounds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 22.â The San
Rafael Golf Club chose the anniversary
of the birth" of the father of his coun
try as a fitting occasion for the infor
mal opening of its new grounds on the
Wagner tract, about three mile's north
west of this city, and accordingly the
grounds were the Mecca to-day of San

Gossler, at the close of to-day's sitting
said: "It is imperative that something
should be done to arrive at an under
standing, as it is impossible to agree to
abandon for five years all prospect of
strengthening the cavalry."
Although the action of the committee
may be modified at the subsequent stages

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 22.â
The game played on the campus this after
noon between the Fireman's Fund nine
of San Francisco and the varsity team
resulted in i. victory for the visitors, the
score being 7to 3. To-day's defeat makes
the third this season that the collegians
have suffered at the hands of the insur
ance writers. The previous contests wera
won by scores of 4 â o and sâl. The visit
ing team brought with it a large number
of enthusiastic supporters who lost no op
portunity to encourage their favorites.
The first inning did much to take the
ginger out of the varsity. By scientific
hitting the visitors gained four runs. The
same performance was repeated the
fourth time at the bat, when three men
crossed the plate. Stanford did not re
cover until the last inning. X bit by Mur
phy brought one man in and two others
made home on a bail knocked by Strohn
Into left field. Botr teams played loosa

LOST WITH THE SINKING
OF THE LINER BULGARIA
Four Survivors Picked Up at Sea Hoid Out No
Hope for Those Who Were Left
Aboard the Vessel.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 22.â The British J
steamship Vittoria, Captain Wetherell,
arrived to-day from Hull via Hampton ,
Roads, with four of the crew of the
miÃsing Hamburg-American liner Bul
garia. The rescued mariners are Sec
ond Mate C. Scharge, Quartermasters
Carl Ludtke and John Schulze and Sea
man William Starke. They were picked
up by the Vittoria from an open boat
from the Bulgaria three and a half
hours after they had been cast adrift
in latitude 40 north, longitude 43 west,
on February 5. They, with ihe twenty
five women and children who were
picked up by the steamship Weehawken
and landed in Ponta del Gada, Azores
Islands, a week ago, are all that have
been heard from of the crew of eighty
nine men and the forty-one passengers
which the Bulgaria had on board when
she sailed from New York for Bremen
on January 28.
Captain Wetherell said he sighted the
Bulgaria in a disabled condition at 5
a. m. on February 5, flags flying and the
Weehawken standing by and commu
nicating with her. There was a heavy
eea on and his vessel drifted away from
the disabled craft, but he again iocated
her. He saw the men aboard the crip
pled ship attempt to lower a. boat, and
just as four of them got into it It broke
loose from the steamship and drifted
away. The four men made an effort
to row back to the Bulgaria, but could
not reach her on account of the high
seas. The Vittoria was preparing to
lower a boat to go to the assistance of
those on the Bulgaria when the four
men came alongside. After consider
able difficulty they were taken aboard.
During a lull the second officer of the
Bulgaria, accompanied by six of the
crew of the Vittoria, manned the boat
just vacated and started for the sink
ing steamship. They were scarcely
away from the side of the Vittoria,
however, before another gale began,
and the brave fellows, not being able
ro reach the Bulgaria, found it impos
sible to return to the Vittoria until sev
eral hours had passed.
Captain Wetherell would not aban
don hope of being of assistance to those
on board the ill-fated vessel and re
mained in sight of her until nightfall,
when a perfect hurricane arose and
carried the waiting ship miles away.
TO ATTEND THE
FAURE FUNERAL
Loubet Will Accompany
the Procession.
Bp*ci&l Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Feb. 22.â The Solr an
nounces that M. Manau, the
Procurateur General, will sub
mit his report in the Dreyfus
affair next week. The report
will ask the Court of Cassation,
it is said, to annul the convic
tion without ordering a retrial.
If this be correct it shows that
the evidence before the court not
only proves Dreyfus innocent,
but that the crime for which he
was punished never existed, as
the French law allows the Court
of Cassation to quash a sentence
without retrial only when there
is proof that the offense alleged
was never perpetrated.
P\RIS. Feb. 22.â President Loubet
has notified M. Dupuy of his intention
to accompany the Faure funeral pro
cession from the beginning to the end
of the route, though his friends have
vainly tried to dissuade him by point
ing out the danger of a hostile mani
festation.
The League of Patriots applied for a
place in the procession, but M. Dupuy
refused the request on the ground that
the league Is a center of anti-consti
tutional agitators and has already in
sulted the President. The followers of
M. Deroulede are very angry and are
talking Of revenge.
Troops have been pouring into the
city all day for the ceremony and It is
estimated that no fewer than 100,000 are
already here. The police are ready for
any emergency. Seats along the route
are being sold at extravagant prices.
The police this morning seized in the
rity 10,000 medals bearing the head of
the Duke of Orleans and five molds for
striking them. The medals are in
prribed as follows: "I will only avenge
my country's insults. Philippe," and
"I will replace my country- in the first
rank of nations, with the help of all
true Frenchmen."
In view of possible demonstrations
to-morrow on the occasion of the fu
r.eral of the late President Faure, the
prefect of police has authorized the
seizure of all seditious emblems, the^ ar
rest of their wearers, the dispersal of
ail street gatherings and "the arrest of
anybody raising Insulting cries against
the President, members of Parliament
or other state officers.

SUICIDE ATTEMPTED BY
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER:
PETALUMA, Feb. 22.â Miss Hannah
Howard was this morning reprimanded
by her mother for having remained out
late last night. Thereupon she took a
dose of carbolic acid. The mother, see
ing the result of her upbraiding, rushed
out of the house and ran toward the river.
As she reached the railroad track the
*:30 train was just pulling out and she
attempted to throw herself in front of
the engine. The crowd at the depot j
rushed out and pulled her from the track.
The girl was severely burned, but will re

In the morning the Bulgaria was not
to be seen and the Vittoria proceeded
on her Journey.
The story of the experience of the
Bulgaria, as told by Second Officer
Pcharges. is a thrilling one.
"On February 1, at about 8 p. m.,"
said he, 'a hurricane of so severe a
nature was encountered that it was
found impossible to make any headway,
and at 2 a. m. the following day we
were forced to heave to. The flying
bridges, both fore and. aft, were carried
away and seamen and passengers were
afraid to venture on deck for fear of
being swept into the sea. At about 7
a, m. the spring in the rudder, which is
used to break the strain of heavy seas,
collapsed, and soon afterward the en
tire steering gear was washed away.
The steamship then fell in the trough
and was left at the mercy of the wind
and waves.
"Sea after sea swept over us," con
tinued Scharges. "smashing in the
doora of the cabin and deckhouses,
flooding the main deck, washing in the
awning deck and creating havoc all
over the ship. To make matters worse,
100 horses that were stabled on the up
per forward deck stampeded, and in
their fright made a wild dash, tramp
ling each other to death. This state of
affairs lasted until all but twenty had
been killed or drowned in the wash of
the waves. Then the butcher of the
vessel, with a number of seamen, went
into the pen and tried to quiet the
beasts that remained. This failing, as
did also the attempt to force the fren
zied animals overboard, their throats
were cut. Before the maddened animals
were dispatched, however, the butcher
had both his legs broken and one of
the seamen was badly injured.
"Any idea that our troubles were over
was soon dispelled when it was found
that the vessel was leaking. All the
hatch coverings had been blown off and
before they could be replaced, four of
the seven holds filled and all had con
siderable water in them. The cargo next
shifted, listing the steamer heavily to
port. In addition the carcasses of the
dead horses washed aport added to the
heavy list.
"For seventy-two hours," added Mr.
Scharges. "passengers and crew
worked like slaves, throwing the cargo
overboard to lighten the ship, but it
was of little avail. Inch by Inch, foot
by foot, the ship settled, and as she
sunk deeper the waves washed with
greater force and freedom over her.

NO CENSORSHIP
IN NICARAGUA
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A "Washington special to the Herald says:
Senor Correa, Charge dAffaires of Nicaragua, will call at the State De
partment to-morrow and assure the officials that the failure of the State
and Navy Departments to receive messages from their agents in Nica
ragua is not due to any censorship established by President Zelaya.
As a matter of fact It was not until this morning that Senor Correa re
ceived from President Zelaya a dispatch, having been three days with
out communication with Managua. He thinks this shows that the tele
graph line between Managua and San Juan del Sur, where the cable
station is located, was interrupted, probably by a storm. With respect
to the failure of the Navy Department to hear from or get messages
from the Marietta, it Is pointed out that the cable station at San Juan
del Sur is connected with Greytown by means of an overland line,
which might have been cut or its operation prevented by a storm, or
perhaps by the insurgents. He called attention to the message he re
ceived from the Western Union Telegraph Company in explanation of
its failure to deliver a cablegram from him to President Zelaya, saying:
"From San Juanâ Tours yesterday to President, Managua, unde
livered. Land lines interrupted."
He believes this explanation will be satisfactory to the State Depart
ment and sees no necessity for the investigation which the Detroit has
been ordered to make.
CANAL BILL HAS
AN EVEN CHANCE
May Yet Pass at This
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: In its final
report to the President the Nicaraguan
Canal Commission will confirm the rec-
: ommendation made in its preliminary '
i report In favor of the adoption of the
j Lull route for the waterway. The com- I
\ mission has estimated on seven routes. !
! four of which are practically the Lull <
I route, and none fall much below the !
i estimate of $124,000,000 which the ma- j
I Jority of the commission fixed as the ,
| cost of the canal.
Conservative public men say there is â 
still an even chance for the passage rrf
the Nicaraguan canal legislation at j
; this session of Congress. The river and j
harbor bill, to which the Nicaraguan |
â  canal rider has been attached, will come I
I up In the Senate to-morrow during the ;
I morning hour. It is proposed by friends i
â¢ of the canal to try to limit the debate I
1 and to secure favorable action. Should '
I the provision be placed in the bill there ,
! will be a strong fight made against It
j by the House conference.
With respect to diplomatic negotia
i tions regarding the canal It is stated
that the State Department has not yet
negotiated any treaty with either Nica- ;
ragua err Costa Rica. President Iglesias
of Costa Pvica will be In Washington
I after the adjournment of Congress, and !
I it is expected he and Secretary Hay will
j discuss the advisability of drawing up
a treaty providing for the construction ;
I of the canal by the United States. '
SAN JOSE SUICIDE
FINALLY IDENTIFIED
SAN JOSE. Feb. 22.â The man who com

corner of First and St. John streets, on
Sunday morning has been identified as
James Alexander Lovie of San Francisco.
He was a concrete contractor, well known
throughout the State, having done a great
d&al of work in San Francisco and Los
Angeles. He was a brother of Postmaster
Lovie of Redwood City, and it was the
latter who identified the remains to-day.
Lovie was 38 years of age and unmar
ried. He was well-to-do and his relatives
can give no reason for his self-destruc
tion. A couple of years ago Lovie fell
down an elevator shaft in San Francisco
and injured his head. Since then he was

"At 4 o'clock on the morning of the

engine room and four pumps could not

The "Weehawken was the first to bÂ«: of
service, as she sent two. boats in which
the twenty-rfve women and children
were placed. These were landed safely
on the Weehawken. but after that the
storm increased in violence. On-i of our
boats was smashed, and it became al
most impossible to lower another on
account of the vessel being so far down
on the port side and correspondingly
high on the starboard, where the re
maining boats were made fast. An
other attempt was made and one was
successfully got into the sea. I and
the three men who were saved with me
Jumped into her to take the oars, when
by some unfortunate accident we were
cut loose. The men on the vessel were
seen after that to try repeatedly to
lower another boat, but without suc
cess."
The second officer said that the con
duct of the crew and passengers was
excellent. The women were especially
brave. He thinks there is little likeli
hood that the Bulgaria weathered the
storm that night, as she was sinking
when he left her.
The Koordistan. the third vessel that
saw the distress of the Bulgaria with
out being able to be of assistance be
cause of the tempestuous seas, arrived
in Bremen on the 19th inst. and reported
that the Bulgaria had foundered. Sec
ond Officer Scharges is reasonably posi
tive that none were rescued from the
111-fated vessel after he left her, and it
is feared that 101 persons went down
with her.
The Bulgaria had no accommodations
for first-class passengers and all the
passengers on board were in the steer
age. They were mostly Germans from
different parts of the United States.
She was not a regular liner and had
been in the service of the Hamburg-
American line about a year.

AWAITING THE
POPE'S LETTER
Archbishops in America
Have No Comment.
Special PUpatch to The Call.
BALTIMORE Feb. 22.â Cardinal Gib
bons said to-day that he had not yet re
ceived the letter in which the Pope dls-
cusses "Americanism," and which has
been partly published, and added "I
expect to receive it and have it ready
for publication by Saturday next. Until
then I have no comment to make upon
the subject."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â Archbishop
Martinelli, the papal delegate, stated
to-day that no copy of the Pope's letter
on American Catholics, made public in
Rome yesterday, had been received at
the legation. Under the circumstances
the delegate would not discuss the
Pope's utterances as given in the cable
reports of the letter. These are regarded
as fragmentary and giving no adequate
scope of the letter.
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â A London dis
patch to the Journal says Cardinal
Vaughan, Archbishop of Westminster,
granted an interview to the New
Journal correspondent to-day in regard
to the Pope's letter to Cardinal Gibbons
on Americanism in the church. After
expressing himself as thoroughly in
sympathy with the terms and spirit or
the Popes letter Cardinal Vaughan
"I have the utmost certainty of the
acceptance by the American Catholics
of the encyclical. I cannot conceive
why any one should be anxious or
doubtful as to the attitude of Catholics
in the United States toward the Holy
Father's encyclical. American Catholics
are heart and soul with the Pope. They
are and always have been faithful chil
dren of the church. There will not be
one hair's breadth of difference between
the teaching of Leo XIII and the con
victions or professions of Catholics in
the United States. I know them well.
They are thoroughly sound and papal
in all church matters. Whatever the
Holy Father says is right.'

A LIAR GONE MAD.
WHOM the gods would destroy they first
make mad is a proverb that has come
down to us from the wisdom of antiquity.
instances have occurred at every stage of
world's progress to attest its truth. A sin long
persisted in becomes a mania, the mania grows to
madness, and the madness destroys the wretch who
Jias given himself to sin.
A new instance, on a low scale indeed, but not the
â¢Ie& striking because of its depravity, has been fur
.'iitehed of this truth in the de\elopment of James
Creehnan"s lying from a mania to a madness which
';es an utter intellectual collapse.
The Examiner of yesterday displayed in something
like circus poster type on the first page a dispatch
from Creelman declaring: "Verbal messages from
tor Hoar to the Filipinos, sent through the rebel
agents at Washington, are stirring up the natives to
continue the struggle agaii.st United States
.authority.''
.. -It is not to be supposed that any creature out of a
madhouse believes such a story. Even in the Ex
aminer olTice itself it is doubtful if there be any one
yith so strong an affinity for lying as to give it cre
denve while giving it a. grand display. Doubtless the
graph editor .-neered as he read it. and the com
positor snickered as he set it up. In any other news
tv'iper office in the country the stuff would have been
consigned to the \>, aste-basket. The editors of the
KxV-iver. however, know what their boss likes, and
the lie. which even in print seems to gibber with
.'luiyacy. went to nil the first page in display type.
. By way of adding a little gilding to the lie the Ex
..sm-i'.jef; added what purported to be a dispatch from
Washington: 'That Senator Hoar sent a message to
Filipinos specifically urging them to revolt is not
"creiif'ed. It is believed, however, that his inflam
â y. remarks made prior to the ratification of the
.treaty of peace and since have been tonveyed to the
Filipinos, who have assumed that they were intended
'io encourage them in fighting."
â¢ ; It is safe to assert that no such dispatch was ever
sent' from Washington; that no official in Washing
ton; was ever asked if he thought Senator Hoar had
sent message- to the Filipinos: that no man of any
'â Wp'ute ever said or thought that Senator Hoar made
inflammatory speeches calculated to encourage the
Frlipinbs to attack the American forces in the
-islands.
-The whole thing from first to last, the Washington
as well as the original Creelmanism, is one
of those self-evident lies that carries its refutation in
its 'very odor. Creelman is clearly a. candidate for a
; lunatic asylum. His mania for lying has so far de
.nroyed his intellect that he has lost his cunning. His
falsehoods are now so raw that even the Examiner
Has to cook them before it can offer them for its fool
readers to swallow.
NEWS FROM MANILA.
1~7) UT for the fact that the information of Aguin
fVY- a. 1 - do's intention to inaugurate a massacre came
l-rr through official sources it would receive no
.Credence. This executive of the Filipinos has shown
â mucTi- ability and discretion. He has even made so
' strong a profession of patriotism as to excite sym
pathy.- Aside from the merits of his contentions,
many: have concluded him to be a brave man, and
same of his papers have displayed a breadth of mental
grasp most surprising when considered in connection
with his antecedents.
' . .It is true that he has been guilty of some stupidities,
aÂ« when he sent men armed with bows to face the
fire of American guns, or when he has assumed upon
a power to intimidate this country, but, nevertheless,
to him is conceded many of the qualities of a leader.
The scheme of massacre was not carried out, and
so. .he failed to work for himself that quick and de
cisive disaster he had planned. An indiscriminate
slaughter would have brought down the hostility of
every nation represented in the islands, while Aguin
aldo -ought to have sense enough to know that among
the nations, and even among the people of the United
States, there is a strong feeling that the forces now
there, under Otis should be withdrawn as rapidly as
â /"consistent with honor and dignity. But no part of
civilisation would consent to see the Philippines left
to the mercy of a murderous rabble looting with the
sanction of the so called president.
â¢ ' "-'Aguihaldo seems bent upon displaying such sav
agery as will turn from him all the sympathy that
might "have been his. The massacre business is out
of- date.
The.alleged plot to blow up Alger needs most of
the emphasis on the "alleged."
THE INTEREST OF THE PORTY.
THE interests of the Republican party are served
by the redemption of its promises, by keeping
faith with the people, by such deportment as to
hold to it the good will and favorable opinion of the
C^fr *ltC
No man has yet appeared to publicly maintain that
any of these things can be done by permitting the
party to be used by the Southern Pacific. Railroad as
an agency to elect Burns to the Senate.
It is a brief retrospect to the last campaign. . Can
a single one of Burns' twenty-five supporters in the
Legislature say truthfully and with confidence that
he could have been elected if he had frankly declared
Burns to be his choice for the Senate? During the
campaign, and until the ballots were cast, the people
had control of the matter. Why was not the candi
dacy of Burns announced then, when the people
could pass upon it? Compared to such an oppor
tunity for getting the judgment of the whole party,
how contemptible are the little schemes now in action
tc get members of party committees and snap mass
meetings held on private invitation to put up a pre
tense of popular expression!
Barnes frankly submitted himself to the people, as
did Bulla. and even Grant, with all the unspeakable
errors of his campaign upon him, went before the
people as an open candidate. The vote of Bulla and
Barnes, representing the free choice of members who
respect the public judgment, has been equal to that of
Burns, and. joined to the vote for other men who are
under no suspicion of corruption, the free vote of the
joint convention has far exceeded the highest vote for
Burns. It represents the calm judgment of the party,
and if the secret bargain^ and corrupt alliances' for
Burns, which represent the bad faith of the railroad,
shall finally succeed, this vote which now represents
the party's judgment will next year be found to rep
resent the public judgment against the party. Every
where, on trains, in business houses, and all places
where the people meet, every day Republicans are
heard to declare that they would not have voted the
party ticket had they known of this Burns conspiracy,
and that they will not vote it again if that conspiracy
succeed.
GENESIS OF "CINCH" BILLS.
CIXCH bills may properly be designated as
the invention of legislative devils. They are
introduced, not for the purpose of being
enacted into laws, but to alarm the corporations
against which they are directed and to make busi
ness for a corrupt and reckless lobby. Every Legis
lature is afflicted with large numbers of them. Some
"cinch" bills are popular, having for their object the
reformation of acknowledged evils or the correction
of acknowledged abuses. A "cinch" bill is effective
in producing blood just in proportion as it is reason
able and fair. When the lobby directs its attention to
something that needs reformation it is very apt to
strike a popular chord and obtain for itself the as
sistance of large numbers of well-meaning people. It
is only when things go along smoothly and there is
no cause for popular outcry that "cinch" bills be
come poor and poverty-stricken.
But there is never any intention to pass "cinch^
bills. We do not recall a single one of importance
which has ever been enacted into a law. It was said
that the Bank Commission act was originally desig
nated as a "cinch." It was aimed at Ralston and
his stock gambling fellow bankers of San Francisco.
But if it was a "cinch" and designed to bleed the
banks, it was one of those bills possessing popular
features to which we have already referred.
There being no intention on the part of the legis
lative devils to do anything more than frighten in
dividuals and corporations into providing money
with which to defeat the "cinch" bills, it is dangerous
for any sensible person to pay the slightest attention
to them. . In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, if
"cinch" bills are let run, they will die of their own
corruption. Sometimes the newspapers help the
"cinchers" by applauding their bills as reform mea
sures, but this is always done without a proper knowl
edge of the purposes of those who introduce and ad
vocate them.
The files of the present Legislature are loaded
down with "cinch" bills. Where the corporations af
fected have not become alarmed the legislative devils
have appointed committees to investigate and report
information which is intended to work upon the- fears
of the stockholders and officers. But where a bill is
a bald "cinch" neither the newspapers nor the vic
tims should encourage it. To do so is merely to
make money for a corrupt and debased lobby.
It is difficult, however, to expose the men who con
coct "cinch" bills and further their enactment up to
a certain point. They cover, their tracks pretty ef
fectually, and at every stage of their progress loudly
proclaim their virtue and righteousness. But if no
one put up to defend "cinch" bills, we are sure in
time they would cease to be a source of profit to the
lobby or a cause for fear among their victims.
A COLIFORNIO MONOPOLY.
AS a result of the severe blizzard which has just
swept over Florida^ following so closely the
disastrous one of three years ago, it is prob
able the cultivation of oranges on a large scale in j
that State will be abandoned. It is not in California
only that this opinion is held. Our judgment may
be biased by our partiality for our own State, and by
3 natural desire to see its interests advanced, but no
such bias exists in the East, and in that section be
lief that Florida must seek other forms of industry is
Mi strong as it is here.
The New York Sun, for example, after pointing out
that the great destruction of orange groves three years :
ago led about 40 per cent of the growers to abandon !
the business, and that the recent cold wave has killed
all the orange trees in some of the most favored dis
tricts, says:
"The result of this new misfortune will be to in
crease the present tendency in Florida to substitute
other crops for oranges. Many orange-growers have
already turned their attention to other products and
have prospered. They are growing tobacco and hay,
and not a few have gone into stock-raising. More at
tention is row given to pineapples, and though the
pineries were damaged by this cold wave, the loss
will not be very great, for the plant is grown partly
under cever to protect it from the fierce Florida
sun."
The abandonment of the Floridian groves, how
ever, will not mean any lack of home-grown oranges
to supply the demand of the American market. As
the Sun says: "Of course there will now be a fresh
boom in California orange culture. The present tariff
on all citrus fruits has practically stopped orange im
portations, but even if Florida goes out of the busi
ness we may still grow all the oranges we can con
sume. California's crop last year, about 6.000,000
boxes, was larger than the world's output not many
years ago."
While the destruction of the orange groves is a
heavy loss to Florida, it will not be a permanent dis
aster. Even had no killing frosts visited her orchards
the competition ol California would have eventually j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1899.
rendered her orange cultivation unprofitable. The
frost has simply hastened the time when the
Floridians must turn their attention to other products.
PERVERSIONS BY EXPANSIONISTS.
THE speech of President McKinley at Boston,
though not official, was nevertheless carefully!
restrained, and, read in connection with his pub
lic acts and closely interpreted, would be less open to
misconstruction than the meaningless resolution on
cur policy in Asia lately adopted by the Senate of the
United States. In a popular sense, however, it may
be construed as implying views that would not stand
the test of current analysis or historical criticism.
The expansion newspapers â at least some of them â
read it as embracing three propositions â First, that
the United States was providentially drawn into rela
tions with the Philippines; second, that it thus con
tracted an obligation to become the liberator or
rescuer of the Filipinos; and, third, that tor these
reasons- it is now a plain duty to subdue their rebel
tion against the supposed authority we have bought
from Spain, and, when they are prepared to receive
ir, to compel them to accept a free government framed
at Washington.
These deductions, extracted by the expansionists
from the President's speech, are inconsistent both
with law and with fact, and, in themselves and apart
from the argument they misrepresent, would place our
country in an unenviable position before the world.
When the Maine waÂ« destroyed, if we had boiled
over and declared war, our logic would have been
weak, but our patriotism strong. We held our tem
per and submitted the tragedy to a commission, which
failed to bring in a judgment against Spain. The war
was begun against the protests of some public men of
indubitable patriotism, and at first did not even com
mand the hearty approval of the President himself.
Its avowed causes were the deplorable condition of
Cuba and the necessity of avoiding breaches of neu
trality. The sole expressed purpose of the war was
to drive Spain out of Cuba and enable the Cubans
to set up an independent government. The acquisi
tion of the Philippines or the conquest of any Spanish
Colony, even Porto Rico, was not within the declara
tions of our Government, expressly or by implication,
as we placed ourselves on record. Our first effort
was to destroy the naval power of Spain for the pro
tection of our own sea coast, both on the Atlantic
and Pacific. This was more than half accomplished
by following and destroying the Spanish fleet in
Manila Bay, by general consent one of the most ex
traordinary feats recorded in naval warfare. But we
did not then design â or at least acknowledge the de
signâto capture the Philippines. True, Manila was
at our mercy, but, independently of our own senti
mental proclamations, the archipelago, without gross
inconsistency on our part, was not in a condition to
be captured. The Filipinos had long been in rebel
lion against Spain and had maintained their cause
with a success equal to that of Garcia and Gomez in
Cuba. Our objective point was Cuba, and Cuba
alone, and only Cuba for the Cubans. We were con
ducting the first war that had been projected, as we
constantly assumed, solely for humanity and without
thought of material gain. In fact, we occupied the
attitude of the Don Quixote of nations. When we
arrived in Manila we encouraged the Filipinos, who
had not invited us to become their rescuers or lib
erators, only because they produced diversions in our
favor and because the destruction of Spanish author
ity there helped us in our Atlantic campaign and
reciprocally helped the Filipinos in their home
struggle for independence. There was at that time
no evidence of any special providence driving us into
the necessity of liberating or rescuing so many of the
Filipinos as might survive after we had bombarded
them in the name of the Declaration of Independence
and the constitution of the United States. On the
contrary, they were deluded into the belief that we
meant what we said, and the entire plan of using the
extinguished title of Spain, through a purchase of
money, as a pretext for our enforced benefactions,
repeatedly declined, and as the basis of a conquered
possession, was an afterthought not only grossly in
congruous with our institutions and with our his
tory but a breach of national faith, urged on under
the false pretense of extending trade and commerce
by speculators who saw wealth abroad, by employers
who wanted cheap labor at home, by ambitious
soldiers who coveted military distinction and by
politicians who sought to allay internal discontent
and advance schemes inimical to American civiliza
tion, while the eye of the people was fixed upon
Asiatic iridescence.
It is this unwarrantable scheme into which the ex
pansionists seek to impress their President, elected by
manhood suffrage.
MOTRIMCNY AS fl CORRECTIVE.
Iâ*v1 â *v OUBTLESS many men have been made better
) by marrying, and thus securing the close
* â^ companionship of a good woman. Neverthe
less, a woman who essays to reform a drunkard and
profligate by becoming a wife to him is apt to repent
in sorrow. Her task is a hopeless one, and for her
to attempt to classify it as missionary work is futile.
It is simply foolishness.
Recently San Francisco has had the benefit of a
notable example, a reformer, whose work was the
rescuing of the wrecks of the slums, having reached
into the gutter and drawn therefrom a husband.
Whatever the intentions of the man may have been,
he died drunk, a death of violence. His wife could
not restrain his tendency toward evil ways, and she
ought to have known it.
Marriage, is. so honorable, an institution that to
enter into its obligations and keep the fact concealed
from the world argues that there is bad faith. This
particular marriage was of the "contract" variety,
and under the laws of California not a marriage at
all, but an idle form. If a marriage, openly con
tracted, with the sanction of the state, the church and
the family, has so~ often failed when adopted as a
curative for degenerate morals, how much more cer
tainly must it fail when the alliance ist secret and of a
character not to be. revealed lest a reproach come
upon the parties to the union?
If the woman still, have confidence in her ability
to snatch brands from the burning by the process of
wedding them, she ought at least to take them openly
and not hide her action as though the motive had
been something not pure and*lofty.

RANCH AND RURAL LIFE
The flavor of June butter is caused by benign bacteria which flourish
in the season equivalent to the Eastern June. In fact all flavors, good and
bad. in milk, cream and butter. 'are caused by bacteria. If the churn is left

The Woman's Tribune says that between 1880 and 1890 the egg business
increased 79 per cent. It is estimated that the value of the eggs produced
now in this country is $180,000,000 a year, or three times the output of our
cold mines. The patient housewife is responsible for most of the care and
attention which enables the little epeckled hen to earn nearly J200.000.000
annually.

This is not a cookery and receipe column, but in view of the excellence
of California almonds and walnuts and the ease with which they are to be
had this way to make nut biacuit will be acceptable. Two teaspoons bak
ing'powder, quart of flour, quarter cup of sugar, half cup butter, three
beaten eggs stirred into the rest when dry; add half pound nuts, ground or
chopped fine, and milk enough tp mix; roll in half-inch sheets, cut into
rounds and bake in a quick oven.
Ten thousand coach and draft horses have been contracted for, to be

We don't know how much use is made of sugar beet pulp in this State
for cattle feed. We see it stated that at the beet factory in-Lehi, Utah,
the daily ration for 1200 cattle is 100 tons beet pulp and seven tons of hay,
but are not informed whether this is for stock cattle or feeders for beef.
Fowls like green feed. Ten geese eat as much pasture as one cow, and

The freezing of the Florida orange trees again will probably perma
nently discourage citrus orcharding in that State and throw upon Califor
nia the whole demand for .American fruit. For several years the Florida
planters have been putting out more shaddock or grape fruit than orange
orchards. The popularity of the shaddock is permanent and increasing. As
a breakfast fruit, a mouth cleanser, it has no equal. It should be taken
plain or with a little salt sprinkled on, though some prefer sugar. It grows
better and produces more abundantly in California than in Florida and is a
very long keeper and can be shipped in barrels as "rolling freight" at
cheaper rates.
A new plan in egg storage has been tried in Leith, where 50,000 Scotch,
Irish and Danish eggs were kept four months with but little loss. The
storage is cool and even in tempeiature with the eggÃ so packed that by
turning a crank they are turned a little every day. This keeps the yolk
in its natural position in the center of the white. Eggs are spoiled by the
yolk settling on one side and touching the shell. The Leith plan is war
ranted to keep eggs fresh for six months.

WHEN I WAS A BOY
Up in the attic where I slept
When I was a boy, a little boy,
In through the lattice the moonlight crept,
Bringing a tide of dreams that swept
Over a low, red trundle bed,
Bathing the tangled curly head,
While the moonbeams played at hide and ?eek
With the dimples on the sun-browned cheek-
When I was a boy, a little boy!
And, oh, the dreams â the dreams I dreamed
When I was a boy, a little boy!
Far the grace that through the lattice streamed
Over my folded eyelids seemed
To have the gift of prophecy
And to bring the glimpses of time to be
When manhood's clarion seemed to call-*
Ah, that was the sweetest dream of all
When I was a boy, a little boy!
I'd like to sleep where I used to sleep
When I was a boy, a little boy!
For in at the lattice the moon would peep.
Bringing her tide of dreams to sweep
The crosses and griefs of the years away
From the heart that is weary and faint to-day.
And those dreams^should grive me back again
A peace I have never known since thenâ
When I was a boy, a little boy! FIÂ£LD>
STATE NOTES.
Mr. C. T. Harris of Covina advises irrigators whose orchards depend
upon water from the ditches to use plenty of water in March and April,
when the loss by evaporation is less than later in the season.
The Colusa Gazette says: "Several /armers were in town yesterday
playing pedro, and took home vegetables raised by gardeners in S,an Fran
cisco."
The Washington Press says that Warm Springs ia the principal ship,
ping point for mushrooms to the San Francisco market. The varieties are
the wild mushroom, agaricus campestris and others: They are carefully
inspected and packed in one-pound boxes. Many go from the same place to
Los Angeles, as they bear shipping long distances. California is the prin
cipal producer of edible fungi in the United States. The greatest variety
of these fungi in the world is produced in India, where the edible and
poison sorts so closely resemble each other as to bar an amateur from the
enjoyment of this delicious food. The best Indian expert is the monkey.
It is customary to submit the specimens to a monkey. He will examine
them carefully and infallibly reject the non-edible. The Indian elephant
has the same instinct, and feeds on the benign sorts, carefully rejecting
those that are toxic.
The prospect of a fine apricot crop in Vaca Valley is at this time good.
Solano County will have 3000 acres in sugar beets this year, a very de
sirable diversification in crops.
The increase in wheat acreage sown this year is 10 per cent.
The Alta Advocate says that Mr. J. T. Bearss of Dinuba protects the
fruit buds in his orchards from linnets by a spray made of four pounds
whale oil soap, four gallons hot water and a pint of kerosene, thoroughly
mixed. To use, add one quart of the mixture to four gallons of hot water
and spray the trees when the birds begin to work. It should be used hot,
about 130 degrees.
Shasta County is coming forward as an olive producer. The Alexander
ranch in Happy Valley has put on the market this year ripe queen olives
of first quality.
San Joaquin farmers checked the too rapid growth of rye by turning
stock on it. The idea is treated as a discovery. It is practiced con
stantly in England, where sheep are turned on the wheatfields. Tramp-
Ing and cropping the wheat makes It stool and increases the yield.
The Santa Paula Chronicle. Ventura County, was sold in January with
the stipulation that if 5 inches of rain fell before February 1 the price
should be increased $500. Just 4 inches fell and the seller lost $500 by an

A subsidy of $4000 has been subscribed for a cannery at Santa Ana.
The orchards of the county farm, or almshouse of San Bernardino, have

VIEWS OF THE INTERIOR PRESS.
A Sacramento correspondent of a San
Francisco newspaper tells exultingly of
the efforts of a Senatorial gang trying to
win a vote by taking a legislator to San
Francisco and putting him through a de
bauch there. It Is regarded as a very
smart proceeding by the correspondent,
and the editorial page of that paper has
no condemnation of such politics. Per
mit us to say that such proceedings are
Infamous and that California would' be
better without a Senator than to have
one choÃen by such methods. The poli
ticians resorting to such practices are do-
Ing most to disrupt the Republican party.
Th^re are certainly a good many decent
Republicans In the Legislature and they
should get together and rebuke the
schemes of the depraved and infamous.â
Santa Rosa Republican.
THE FOLLY OF WORKS.
The press received many a hard blow at
the hands of some of the State Senators
yesterday while discussing the Works
bill. This bill is called the- anti-cartoon
bill; it also really prohibits the printing
of portraits without the consent of the
person. In the discussion Simpsonâ the
deserter of home campâ went all to pieces
and tried to offer some excuse for his ex
istence. , .. mM .
A number of good and substantial
speeches were made in support of the
present law and against this proposed
folly.â Berkeley World-Gazette.
IS A FALSE ALARM.
If Dan Burns were the great politician
that his few friends claim him to be he
would have tethered Senator Simpson out
in the brush rather than that the mis
representative from Pasadena should cast
a vote for him in the condition that ne
did The inability of Burns to make any
real headway in his Senatorial campaign
shows conclusively that as an astute poli
tician he is a "false alarm."â Los Angeles
Times.
LEGISLATURE AND PRESS.
Benator Morehouse. the author of the
bill making it justifiable homicide to kill
editors on sight, ha* just introduced a
supplementary bill providing that the
name of the author of every article shall
be printed with it, so that the irate seeker
after vengeance may identify his victim.
The bill Is, of course, unworkable under
newspaper conditions, as nearly every ar
ticle passes through at least two hands,
and the man who writes the article is not
the one who determines its final form.
Any practical law on the subject could
only result, as It has in France, in the
regular employment of a "responsible"
editor, who has nothing to do with what
?oes into the paper, but undertakes to de
end whatever may appear against all
comers. He is a fighting editor pure and
pimple. In Germany they have a jail edi
tor, whose business it is to "sit," which
Is the German euphemism for going to
lall whenever the paper runs afoul the
lese majeste laws.
Seriously, this anti-newspaper crusade
is worse than a mere bad joke. The leg
islative proposals that have attracted at
tention are pure freak bills, but the ten
dency to introduce and even pass them
indicates a breach between the official and
unofficial organs of public opinion that is
unfortunate. A newspaper is nothing if
it is not at once a leader and a follower of
public opinion, and a lawmaking body is
nothing except under the same conditions.
âFresno Republican.
SIMPSON AND NOAH.
Senator Simpson of Pasadena, who,
while on a jamboree, left Bulla to vote
for Burns, is in some respects like unto
Noah, and yet unlike him. Noah, you
will remember, dearly beloved, lay drunk
and naked In his vineyard. Simpson had
the vineyard inside him. and the naked
ness which he exposed was that of his
own alleged intellect and honor.âSacra
mento Bee.
NOT PAID FOR HONOR
And yet it is perhaps not so strange that
Simpson should transfer his allegiance
from Bulla to Burns. While he had
pledged his honor to stick to Bulla, he
had evidently not been hired to do it.
There is a wide difference in the ethics of
some Legislatures between honor and spot
cash. The men who got the ante-election
boodle stand firmly and reliably.â Los An
geles Herald.
JAIL AS A REFUGE
Newspaper men should take heart.
Works' anti-cartoon bill has no terrors
for the editors of the paper published in
the Stillwa^r (Minnesota) Penitentiary,
and there is no reason why a similar en
terprise should not be inaugurated In this
State an soon as the various imbecile
measures aimed at newspapers become
laws. â Marysvilla Appeal.

AND CREDITORS
PR DECrtMANN, Who Left Glen Ellen
Undef Sensational Circumstances.
â â  ITT TIFE, partner and creditors are mourning the disappearance of Dr. Louis
WIFE, partner creditors science natural healing and of Dr. Louis
Dechmann, professor of the science of natural healing and general a ll
' :V V rour '^ confidence man. According to the police, his deserted wife is en
â¢:= x deavoring to assuage her grief in this city, his partner is bewailing a
, rulnjed enterprise and financial losses at Glen Ellen, while his creditors are tell
ing; their troubles in both San Francisco and the little Sonoma County burg.
â¢ Among the sufferers of misplaced confidence in the accomplished but guile
ful physician Is Dr. C. C O'Donnell. The former Coroner of San Francisco has
an elegant country residence, romantically located on the creek which runs
â¢through the town of Glen Ellen and not more than half a mile from the rail
road depot of that place. In October last he made the acquaintance of Dr.
Dechmann and of the latter's partner, William "Weigand. and was informed by
them that they desired to secure an establishment for the opening of a sani
tarium. It was not long before the alluring conversation of the suave Dech
mann induced Dr. O'Donnell to offer the partners a lease of his home place in
.Sonoma County. Without further security than the ostentatious representa
tions made by the smooth spoken professor of natural healing, a lease was ex
ecuted by which the Glen Ellen residence of Dr. O'Donnell was transferred to
the partners for a period of five years at a rental of about $100 a month. The
lessor removed the personal belongings of himself and wife, and added consid
erable new and expensive furniture suitable for the purpose to which the estab
lishment was about to be devoted. He even went so far as to throw off the
first month's rent in order to give the sanitarium promoters a fair start. This
was four months ago, and he has yet to see the color of his tenants' money.
No time was lost by the energetic Dechmann in booming his resort. Elab
orate and costly circulars were designed, printed and distributed for the purpose
of advertising "Marienbad, a sanitarium for the science of natural healing,"
with Louis Dechmann as director and physician, and William Weigand as man
â  ager. In addition to lauding in prose the skill of the director, the great me
dicinal properties of the mineral waters that abound in the locality and the
. healthfulness of the ellmate. these circulars abounded with verses, brain chil
-. dren of the gifted doctor. Nor did the business cards of the institution escape
the infliction of Dechmann rhyme. ,. Room was found on them for the following:
.'.'-,: "â¢ '' "â¢ 'â¢ " The light that the fair Goddess here upholds,
.. . ' â¢ . The air caressing her soft Garments' folds, ,
'. .. . ThÂ» food that from th? ever fruitful ground-,,
'â  .'.''. - â  Kind Mother Nature for- her children found, . â 
". " ': .'.' And water pure, the glorious crystal flood â
â¢ ; â¢â¢" â¢ 'These, mankind, give thee pure and healthy blood.
â  ... * Patients soon began to patronize the institution and during Us short period
. : of existence the revenue amounted to between $700 and. sÃoo. Manager Weigand
-.admits that he enjoyed the handling of $80 .of this amount. Where the balance
went Dr. Dechmann alone knows.
'â ' â ' Last Friday Dechmann made his final appearance at the Glen Ellen sani
tarium. At that time he discussed elaborate plans for the future of the estab
lishment, with his partner. The next information his partner obtained from him
was contained in a letter written at Sacramento on the day following. It stated
. that Dechmann was on his way to Portland, as 'he knew of a good opening there*
that he realized the wrong he was doing his partner and promised to make all
â¢ amends in the future.
.:-â¢. â " -TKts led Weigand to start on a tour of discovery. He came to San Francis
â co and .sought out the wife of Dechmann. He learned then that the doctor had
'.'Govfn; abandoning not only his partner and creditors, but also his wife, to whom he
had -been married for fifteen years. And all apparently for the mistress of a
".house of bad repute named Mary Peltz. It was also ascertained that the
woman, who is .credited with having a considerable amount of money, purchased
â a. ticket for Europe and that she had met Dechmann on Saturday at Vallelo
Junction, whence both went East. â¢ â¢ vt " ie JÂ°
â "â â "To his wife Dechmann had written a letter in which he said- "I loved you
.once, but I love you no more. Good-by forever." Dechmann is about 36 years
of age and his wife is said to be several years his senior, while the companion

to. take any further action toward securing his arrest. In her anger she is
.said to have declared that she knew enough about her. runaway spouse to send
him to State's prison, and that she would do so If she got the opportunity.
" â¢ Weigand, who claims that he rurnished all the money for the enterprise de
clares that he invested more than $1500 in fitting up the sanitarium, and in 'run
ning it since it was opened. Dr. O'Donnell yesterday compelled him to give uu
possession of the place and also the lease, but agreed to allow Weigand and his
. wife to remain there until the Ist of March.
Quite a number of creditors of the sanitarium, both at Glen Ellen and in San
Francisco, will be sufferers from the misfortune of the institution as Weitrand
asserts that he Is now without funds, and many bills remain unpaid. - â¢
Dechmann is said "to be highly educated, speaking seven languages but has
always, according to his own boasting, used his accomplishments to gain a live'
" lihood by his wits. He prides himself that he has made his way through the
world by "bluffing" people, as he designated the baleful art by which he be
trayed and swindled those who trusted him. "

pacemakers. It was the East against
the West in both principals and pacers.
Of the latter the greatest praise is due
Downing and Cotter, the most perfectly
matched tandem team ever seen here.
They took the big Californian the third
mile in 1:45, in which he gained the half
lap which separated him from his wiry
antagonist, as they were started from op
posite sides of the track.
In the seventh mile the chain broke on
one of Elkes' pacing machines and he rode
a lap unaided without losing any ground.
Shortly after this McFarland gained an
other full lap on him and went on. Elkes
saw his tandem was not equal to the fast
clip that was being set, so he jumped out
and caught McFarland, taking pace from
him.
The most sensational riding was done in
the tenth mile. Elkes had his fastest
team, Eaton and Goodman, in service,
and they pulled him past McFarland.
They gained the length of the stretch on
the latter when he changed to the light
ning strikers*. Downing and Cotter. They
went out after the New Yorkers and cut
down their lead with a rush. They caught
them on a corner and presented a sensa
tional picture as the tandem swept
around at tiie rate of over thirty miles
an hour. Those in attendance cheered
until the big exposition building fairly
rang with the volume of sound.
Elkes saw it was futile to match his
pacing, which was poor, against that of
his opponent, and retired. R. P. Aylward
handled McFarland's teams in a masterly
manner.
McFarland continued on for the record.
He secured the world's indoor record for
each mile from three to fifteen. His time
by miles was: One, 2:01; two, 4:04; three,
5:49; four, 7:44; five, 9:44; six; 11:4".; seven,
13:46; eight. 15:41; nine, 17:52; ten, 19:59;
eleven. 21:06; twelve, 23:14; thirteen, 25:14;
fourteen, 27:13, and fifteen, 29:22.
The mile handicap, professional,
brought out a good field of starters, in- j
eluding many of the men who were in
the recent six-day race, and who are
willing to add to their hoard by winning
an additional purse or two if possible. ;
The winners of the three heats were Tom '
Barnaby of Boston, W. G. Furman of Los i
! Angeles and G. A. Wyman of Oakland.
I. Lawson of Chicago, E. Leonart of Buf- |
falo and Teddy Goodman of New York |
finished seconds, and these with Chap- j
man of Georgia, who finished third in the I
fastest heat, qualified for the final. In \
two laps the men were ail lined up in i
Indian file, with Chapman in the lead.
Goodman soon replaced him, and then
Leonart. The latter had lots of speed,
and fought it out with Goodman on the ;
last lap, winning by a short length, Good- '
man taking second. Furman was riding
strong, and rode into third position from
last place. The time of the race was 2:09.
Downing and Cotter, the crack Califor
nia tandem team, won their match race
with Eaton and Goodman of New York, i
in two straight heats. The first heat was !
from opposite sides of the track, and they ,
won it in 2:01. The second was run side ,
by side. Downing and Cotter had the in- j
side, and the others were unable to pass
them. The time was 2:09.
E. F. Russ, Ralph Robinson and Arthur
Davidson won the three heats of the ama- (
teur mile handicap. The others who qual
ified for ttie final heat were Walter J.
Davidson. H. D. Bean, Clay Holmes and i
A. T. Smith. Smith and Russ fell on the
third lap on the east bank, but escaped |
unhurt. Robinson was in front and won j
the race, Walter Davidson second. After j
the finish Russ and Smith protested the I
race, and held an animated conversation
with the judges about it. The official*
held that the accident did not materially
affect the result, and the decision stood.
NOTES OF THE MEET.
Before the races started Henri Fournier,
he of "Infernal machine" fame, brought
out his new motor tandem and gave it
Its first trial on a tracje. Tom Barnaby
sat on the front seat and did the steer
ing, and from the expression on his face
It was evident he did not consider his
job a sinecure. Nevertheless they flnally
got the thing going at a slow pace, grad
ually increasing It until a two-minute clip
was" attained. Fournier was anxious to
make it faster, but Barnaby cried quits.
After they have become more accustomed
to it, great speed is expected. Contrary
to the running of the "infernal machine,"
the tandem is also aided by the work of
the pedals, which tends to Increase its
speed over the single wheel.
The six-day riders are all so fully re
covered from their ride that many of
them entered the professional open event
last night. Among the starters were
Barnaby, Pierce, Fredericks, Julius,
I Nawns, Lawson, Ashinger, Turville,
[ Aaroneon (who finished second) and Stev-
I ens. This jseems to refute the argument
that the men were "dead to the world"
after- the race.
Fournier's exhibition mile on the motor
cycle was ridden in 1:51 2-5. showing that
the Frenchman is getting it down every

Slowly but steadily the turf marks set
by the turf giants of former days are

sand people saw The Bachelor capture
the Thornton stake, over four miles, at
Oakland yesteruay. and the record for the
distance of 7:19^ made by Followcraft at
Saratoga on August 20, 1874, was reduced
to 7:16%.
The Bachelor, earning 113 pounds,
sported in the colors of Ed Corirgan and
was ridden by Bullman. In the betting
he was second Choice, Pat Dunne's sturdy
horse David Tenny holding the place of
honor at odds of 7to 10. The latter looked
the class of the race, and the horsemen
bet their coin on him. Reolia was backed
from 50 to 20. and Veloz. the only other
entry, carried considerable support at
odds of 6 and 7 to 1.
The race proved easy of description, be

ADVERTISEMENTS.
AN EXCELLENT COMBINATION.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well-known remedy,
Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Company, illus-
trates the value of obtaining the liquid
laxative principles of plants known to
be medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to
the taste and acceptable to the system.
It is the one perfect strengthening lax-
ative, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly, and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing Ops
are used, as they, are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Company only. In order to get its ben-
eficial effects and to avoid imitations,
please remember the full name of the
company, printed on the front of every
package.

DR. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
Life Saved by Swamp=Root
The Great Discovery That
Cures Kidney and Blad-
der Troubles.
Statistics prove that more people are
brought to the grave by diseases of the
kidneys and bladder than by any other
disease.
For many years medical science has
been trying to discover some remedy
that would positively overcome these
dangerous troubles.
But not until recently was the dis-
covery made. Doctor Kilmer, the emi-
nent physician and scientist, after
years of study and research, and after
test on test that never varied in the
grand result, announced the discovery
of Swamp-Root, which has proven
itself a most wonderful cure for all dis-
eases of the kidneys and bladder.
While Swamp-Root has proven such
a remarkable success in curing kidney
and bladder diseases, It has also proved
equally invaluable in the cure of blood
diseases, rheumatism, liver and stom-
ach troubles and in the regulation and
cure of all uric acid troubles.
Swamp-Root has been tested In so
many ways. In hospital work, in pri-
vate practice, among the helpless too
poor to purchase relief, and has proved
so successful in every case that a spe-
cial arrangement has been made by
which all readers of The Call, who have
not already tried it, may have a sam-
ple bottle sent absolutely free by mall.
Also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and containing some of the thou-
sands upon thousands of testimonial
letters received from men and women
who owe their good health. In fact,
their very lives, to the wonderful cura-
tive properties of Swamp-Root. Be sure
and mention the San Francisco Daily
Call when sending your address to Dr.
Kilmer & Co., Binghamton. N. Y.
This great modern discovery is for
sale at most drug stores in fifty-cent
and one dollar sizes.

deared them to the people of this city and
â¢.. caused their names to be inscribed on a
"â â  r^ll of honor which will be preserved In

â¢â ;â . Of the honor and esteem in which- they
ere held by their fellow cltiiens. The
.. â presentations of the glittering badges of
.. â  ; .honor, merit and distinction, so worthily
â  â â â¢bestowed, were made through the medium
>;â¢-*-â  of qualified representatives of the people
; â¢ in the persons of the Mayor of the city
and the president of a great mercantile
'."â .:' body which was organized for the cx
.â¢'. press and laudable purpose of promoting
.'. .'â  the. welfare of the community.
Thi* ceremony took place in Metropoli
tan Temple, which was packed â¢to the
doors with the onmrades of the recipi
ents of the enviable distinction, together
with thousands of men and women proud
of the gallant behavior of their fellow
citizens on a mo=t trying occasion and
happy in being afforded an opportunity to
â¢witness the bestowal of a fitting reward. ,
The reception which the heroic trio re
ceived when they made their appearance '
on the stage in response to the summons <
of the chairman, for â  the purpose of re- <
-.ceiving their well earned decorations and <.
â¢ â¢to listen to the eloquent words of praise
; for their conduct which fell from the lips
; of the orators, was a genuine ovation, and <
the brave men who had dashed fearless
| ly through raging flames and blinding '
smoke, challenging and defying death a: i
â  Â«very step, in a desperate determination,
. to rescue the unfortunates apparently
1 doomed to certain destruction, were <
-abashed and confused in the presence of ,
.â â¢ the admiring, shouting multitude. They
' shrank involuntarily from the roarÂ«
'â¢of applause that burst spontane- <
;"ously from two thousand throats and.
swept through the building like the sud-^
den and irresistible blast of a tornado. <
â  The demonstration was a remarkable ex- .
hibition of the depth of feeling aroused^
â¢ in the breasts of the spectators, but it 1
was but a simple expression of the sen-
. timents entertained by the entire com
munity, of the thousands of citizens of
'â¢ San Francisco who for various reasons
. were unable to be present to witness in
â¢â¢person the triumph of their heroes. The
â¢ name of the late Fire Chief, Scannell,
â that grand old hero whose generous re
membrance of his former comrades
made possible the rewarding in a fitting
.â¢manner the life-savers in the department
.' which was his pride .and glory, was
â¢ cheered repeatedly during the ceremonies,
:' as was Chief Sullivan, his successor and
â¢ present efficient head of the Fire Depart
ment.
Three medals were bestowed, all in rec
ognition of the deeds of the recipients in
â¢ caving lives. There were but two Scan
â¢' nell medals available, but the Merchants'.
â¢ -Association came to the rescue with a
third in order that all â¢ three of the fire
' men who had won extraordinary distinc
tion during the past year might be sult-
ably and similarly rewarded. .-.
;â¢ â¢ By order of Chief Sullivan, every mem
â 'â¢ ber of the Fire Department who could
: lie spared from duty temporarily assem
â¢ bled in front of the City Hall at 1:30 p. m.
'â¢ and marched to the Temple, escorted by a
â¢.platoon of police under the command of
â¢ Captain Spillane and. preceded by the fa
mous police drum corps.. On arriving at
Â£ the Temple the firemen were marched
;: down the aisles to the seats in the center
'â¢' of the house, which â¢ had been reserved
' for them and from which they could ob
tain an unobstructed view of the pro
ceedings. On the stage were seated the
' Fire Commissioners, - representatives of
the veteran firemen, Chief Sullivan,
â Mayor Phelan and President Dorhmann
of the Merchants' Association. Assistant
.Chief Doherty sat in the body of , the
â house with the firemen. >" The interior of |
â  -the Temple was tastefully and appropri
ately decorated for the occasion. - A largo
portrait of the late Chief Scannell occu
pied a prominent place at the rear of the
stage in full view of the audience, while
around it was draped the national colors
with a generous sprinkling of tern leaves.
The footlights were lined with a row of
potted palms, the American coat of arms
occupying a central position directly In
front of the speakers stand, while over
head the folds of two immense Ameri
can flags were draped in a great arch.
The spectators came, full to the neck
with enthusiasm, and they proceeded to
let off steam almost before they were
fairly seated. The appearance of Mayor
Phelan walking down the aisle to the
stage was the signal for the first out
burst and the cheering was continued at
Intervals from that time until the last
word had been said and the orchestra
gave the signal to disperse.
Promptly at 2 o'clock President Bohen
of the Fire Commissioners advanced to
the front of the stage and briefly stated
the object of the gathering. He then
called Frederick Sayers, assistant fore
man of engine No. 1, and James Comisky
of truck No. Gto the stage. Sayers res
cued A. H. Christy of Milwaukee from a
room on one of the upper floors of the
Baldwin Hotel, coming upon him just &&
he was about to end his suffering in de
spair by cutting his throat with a razor,
and carrying him to a place of safety.
Comisky, assisted by Assistant Engineer
P. H. Shaughnessy. rescued an unknown
woman from the flames which had seem
ingly cut off all hope of her escape from
the fifth floor of that hotel.
As the two men stepped upon the stage
the audience shouted and cheered until a
desire to hear what was coming next im
pelled it to desist. Mayor Phelan
was then introduced to make the presen
tation speech and dei-orate the uniforms
of the men with the valued Scannell
medals. His Honor painted in glowing
wprds the heroism of the men, and con
trasted their deeds with those which often
win laurels for the soldier on the Â»Â«eld
of battle. He said the firemen were with
out the inspiration that gave added zest
to the courage of the nation's defenders,
and without detracting from the merit of
the latter he thought the firemen were
entitled to even more praise. He drew a
startllngly vivid pictur, by way of illus
tration, of the great cold storage fire at
the World's Fair In Chicago, in which
many firemen Tost their lives, and roused
the enthusiasm of the audience to the
highest pitch by his description of the
valiant, though futile efforts of the com
rades of the doomed firemen to save them
from certain death. The cheers arose
again when the speaker spoke of the
deeds of other San KraJicisco firemen,
some of whom went to their death in
the performance or their duty. He men
tioned the names of Keller, Moholy and
Hallihan. and the firemen arose from
their seats as though propelled by springs
to cheer for their dead comrades, finally
the medals were attached to the breasts
of the two heroes, and they took the seats
reserved for them on the stage amid an
other shout of applause.
Mr. Dohrmann was then introduced to
present the Merchants' Association medal
to Assistant Engineer Shaughnessy. The
latter was also awarded a splendid re
ception as he took his place on the plat
form and stood listening to the words of
praise bestowed freely by the speaker.
Mr. Dohrmann complained that the May
or had stolen his thunder and there was
no time for him to manufacture more.
Nevertheless he succeeded in doing full
justice to his cause, if the amount of ap
plause his remarks evoked is any indica
tion. He complimented Shaughnessy not
only on his bravery but on his efficiency
and sobriety, saying Chief Sullivan had
spoken highly of him. Shaughnessy re
ceived his medal and took his seat be
side his equally fortunate comrades. The
audience wanted to hear from the men,
but President Bohen explained that they
were not accustomed to speerhmaking,
but while they could not give expression
to their feelings on this occasion they
were greatly gratified at the demonstra
tion in their honor.
The chairman then announced that the
Commissioners, with a view of preserving
the names of all firemen who won dis
tinction as life-savers, had prepared a
roll of honor of parchment, which would
last for all time. At present there were
but five names enrolled thereon, being
the names of the three men who had just
received medals and two who had earne/i
similar rewards within fhe past three
years. M. J. Dolan. who rescued J. H.
Rullfs from a burning building on Bu
chanan street on April 3. 1897. and was
awarded a medal on September 11 of the
same year, and John Wills, who saved
two lives. Bessie Wilson and Mrs. Ern
estine Silverstine, from a burning house
at 22 Fifth street on June 22. 1896, and was
awarded a medal on August -20 of that
year. The meeting then adjourned,
though many lingered to inspect the roll
of honor and ask questions about the men
â¢whose names were inscribed therein.

The published report that the popular

O'Nell. who ascribes the rumor to malice
on the part of an advance agent with
whom Rankln Is alleged to have had a
disagreement over accounts at Sacra

"I am a native Californlan and have
always been treated fairly by the San
Francisco press," said Miss O'Neil. "and
I am at a loss to understand why any
paper should thus misrepresent me with
out taking the trouble to find out If such
a report were true. Mr. Rankin is my
business manager and that only. We
are not married and have no Intention of

FEAST OF WORDS AND MUSIC
W. W. FOOTE DELIVERS A PA
TRIOTIC ADDRESS.
Pays a Glowing Tribute to the Father
of His Country and Urgres His
Hearers to Cultivate Pa
triotism.
Washington's birthday was appropri
ately and enthusiastically celebrated In
Metropolitan Temple last evening. The
programme arrang-ed by the board of
management of the Young Men's Insti
tute consisted principally of patriotic in-,
etrumental and vocal selections, which
were extremely well rendered by profes
sional musicians and singers.
The feature of the celebration, however,
was an address by Attorney W. W. Foote
on the subject, "Washington, the Greatest
and Noblest Character the American Na
tion Can Possibly Honor." The speaker
declared that the anniversary of Wash
ington's birth should be commemorated
by every American citizen with the deep
est sense of patriotism. It was he who
founded the republic of the United States,
and it is our duty in consideration of this
in our earnest endeavors and ambitions
to perpetuate the liberal government un
der which we now live, to honor the mem
ory of the statesman and soldier who was
more than any other man responsible for
its birth.
After paying the highest and most laud
able tribute possible to Washington, and
after diffusing in the minds of those pres
ent an enhanced enthusiasm in the cele
bration commemorative of his birth, the
speaker reviewed the Government of me
United States, dwelling parti anlarly on
both its home and foreign policy.
In discusing the growth of the nation
from its inception down to the present
time he touched upon and emphasized the
troubles and internal discords with which
the country has been afflicted and referred
to the final triumph of the stars and I
stripes over every form of tyranny and
oppression that has menaced the nag al
most from the time it was first raised !
over the land of the free and the home of
the brave down to our own generation.
The speaker referred to the recent
Spanish-American war and the annexa
tion of the Hawaiian Islands. In discuss
ing the former he spoke most eloquently |
In support of the policy pursued by the
United States Government in stamping
out and obliterating forever the tyranny,
oppression and inhumanity and cruelty of
Spanish misrule in suffering Cuba. An
nexation, he claimed, was laudable and
right if it was absolutely necessary, but ,
he condemned the policy of the nation
as unwise were it to seek aggrandizement
on any pretext. . . . .. _
In conclusion the speaker spoke of the
one great blessing which has come to the
country as the result of the war-the ob
literation of sectional feeling and the
complete disappearance of the term
"north and south." We are Â£ united
country, and as such are in a position to
assert our position as one of the great
nations of the earth.
WARDE ON SHAKESPEARE.
ThÂ© Actor Lectures for the Benefit
of the Public Playground.
A large and fashionable audience assem
bled in Association Hall yesterday after
noon to hear Frederick Warde, the fa
mous tragedian, give his promised lecture
on Shakespeare. ' .
Almost from the utterance of the first
word until the sound of his voice had died
away on the last Quotation from the
works of the actor-poet Mr. W arde held
the audience spellbound. He was in love
with his subject, and so eloquently did
he paint the^ character of Shakespeare
that for the time at least none could think
other than as he thought. He first re
quested the audience to believe that all
the plays accredited to Shakespeare were
written by him. Then he described
the early days of Shakespeare In the pure
air of the English countryside, where he
grew up as the flowers, whose perfume
was ever in his nostrils. Then the boy
went to the great metropolis, and as he
mixed with the actors and saw the world
his early days came back to him, and he
wove the beautiful sentiments of his boy
hood into the wonderful dramas.
Mr. Warde then took up the chief char
acters In the plays one by one. Illustrat
ing his points with abundant quotations.
ThÂ» lecture was under the ausptces of
the California Club, and the proceeds will
be devoted to the public playground oa
Bush street.
Stole a Dozen Hats.
George McCarthy, a boy 19 years of age,
well known to the police, was arrested
yesterday by Detective Graham and Po
liceman Meyer and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of petty larceny. Two
weeks ago he broke a showcase In front
of Raphael's store on Kearny street and
stole a dozen hats, which he sold cheap
to newsboys at Powell and Market streets.
Since then he has been In hiding:, but
was captured yesterday.
REVOLUTIONARY
TO EXPANSION
Strong Views Against
Imperialism.
PATRIOTISM AT THE BOARD
BRILLIANT BANQUET OF THE
SOCIETY AND ITS GUESTS,
John P. Irish, D. M. Delmas and
Others Plead for Recognition
of the American Con
stitution.
A seat at the banquet board of the Cali
fornia Society of the Sons of the Ameri
can Revolution last night was a glorious
place. The event. In whose commemora
tion the banquet was given, could not
have been more fittingly celebrated in
speech, song and feast, and the Sons of
the American Revolution of San Fran
cisco prepared both programme and feast
on lines which will long be remembered.
At 6 o'clock about 200 members and
guests were present at the Merchants' \
Club. The affair had been elaborately ar
ranged and every possible care taken to
present original and unique details. Trum
peter William G. Hardy, Troop B, Fourth
Cavalry, U. S. A., perhaps the last sur
vivor of the celebrated Custer massacre,
kindly consented to assist in the even
ing's entertainment. He headed the march
to the elegantly decorated dining room,
and when the long line of guests had filed
In sounded the mess call which set them
to feasting. The menu was all that could
be deslredby an epicure.
When appetites were satiated, the trum
peter sounded "The Retreat," and Presi
dent Horace Davis delivered an opening
address, the first number of a long and
Interesting programme. He spoke of the I
necessity of maintaining such societies as
the Sons of the American Revolution,
that the flame of patriotism may never
wane, and that the deeds of national pat
riots may stand as a standard of action
for all men at all times.
Commander J. C. Watson was given a
hearty ovation and detailed many Inci
dents of the past campaign. He modest
ly asked that the people not honor him
until he had accomplished something
worthy of honor, and regretted that he
was staid in his prospective visit to the
shores of Spain. He said that no coun
try was ever in better condition to in
dulge in active warfare than the United
States, and that the senior officers in
both naval and army forces who were
pronounced old fogies before they had
been tried proved more than warriors
when fighting began.
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic" was
well rendered by Rhys Thomas, after
which D. M. Delmas responded to the
first toast, "The Character of Washing
ton and Its Influence Upon the Nation."
"During the past year." he said, "events
have taken place under our own eyes so
flitting that they seemed like the views
in a phantasmagoria or a panorama of a
scenic stage. Within the past year our
lives have been crowded with startling
episodes following one another in sucn
rapid transition that they dazzled our
eyes. From the hour when the ill-fated
Maine sank beneath the waves in Havana
harbor until the hour which marked the
effacing of the last vestige of tyrannical
Spain from the face of the American con
tinent our nation has witnessed one vicis
situde after anotber. We have conquered
and have now the lives and liberties or
eight millions of human beings wrapped
up in our keeping.
"In disposing of this weighty question
let us follow the course which 'Washing
ton, whose memory we celebrate to-night,
mapped out on a chart which guided the
helmsman In his struggle for the Inde
pendence of our peopleâ a course which
indicates the path of national honor and
demarks a national principle from an im-
PC "When Spain lay bleeding at our feet
and when the war is over, let our states
men quote the words of our forefathers,
that breathe in harsh whispers the dan
cers of foreign acquisition. Shall we take
advantage of our position? Shall the ear
of the nation be deaf to the warning
sounded a century ago? Is the Influence
of Washington to be dispelled and his
shade forgotten? Believe It net: The day
of awakening will come. The day of real
ization when reason will resume its sway.
The ashes of Washington lie at Mount
Vernon but his spirit is with us, and it
will be with us yet and forever more.'
Professor Thomas R. Bacon responded
to a toast "Loyalists of the Revolution "
He related the incidents which led up to
thl separation of America from its mother
country and to the situation which faced
the colonists when they heard the com
mand" "Choose ye this day whom ye will

to the toast. "The Ride of Paul Revere. 1

hv Robert Lloyd. John P. Irish then pro
ceeded to respond to the closing toast
"The Flag of Our Country, and V -hat It

and stripes were unfurled to the breeze

there is but one instance in wnicn a
greater nation freed a lesser. Let us fol

Among the guests were Commodore
Watson, Colonel Compton. Lieutenant
Colonel Babcock and Captain Terry' of

Lady Washington Tea.
San Francisco Hive No. 8, Ladies of the
Maccabees, In celebration of Washing
ton's birthday gave a Lady Washington
tea last night in the social hall of the
Alcazar to its friends. There was a good
attendance, and under the direction of
Lady Commander Mrs. Salmond there
was presented for the entertainment of
those present a pleasing programme,
after which there was a grana march
led by E. H. Stevens of San Francisco
Tent, attired as George Washington, and
Mrs Frank Harris of the hive, as Lady
Washington. Then there was a dance,
which was followed by a tea served In
the banquet room. The hall was decor
ated with a number of pictures of the
Presidents of the early days of the re
public the one occupying the position of
honor being that of Washington.

Jaulry tor wool li of â¢ i > broader, : more : general
character, although it is not aÂ« yet reflected In
any increase in the amount of business actu
ally done. A great many samples have been
taken by intending purchasers, however, and
the latter are manifesting decidedly more In
terest In the market, so it will not be sur
prising If there should be a larger business to
report next week. The sales of the past week
aggregate over 3.500,000 pounds, however, which
may be regarded as a fair average week's
business. One feature of the situation is the
fact that smaller manufacturers, who pre
viously had not been much in evidence, have
been comparatively well represented in the
market.
The sales of the week in Boston amount to
2 776 000 pounds domestic and 822,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 3,598,000, against a
total of 4.367,500 for the previous week and a

The Sffiject* I ? the address Tuesday night
by Father Bond was on "Death," and he
drew a vivid picture of the absolute ne
ce-sity of a thorough preparation for the
inevitable dissolution. The speaker pic
tured to those present the agony of those

sin upon their souls, with the full realiza
tion that no one is near to absolve them

The habit practiced by some of deferring
â  their Easter duties, and, in fact, entirely
wandering away from the faith with the
excuse that it will be time enough for
them to repent in their old age or upon
â¢ their deathbed, was condemned. Father
Bond argued that death neither plays
favorites nor indicates the time when he

things, and should approach the sacra
ment.-* often. By doing this he said they
would be brought nearer to God by their
devotion and sacrifice, and. above all,
would be in a state of preparation to meet
the inevitable. He maintained that the
longer a man keeps away from the church
and the longer he defers the duty which
he owes himself and God by keeping the
commandments the more he feels less In
clined to return within the communion of
his church.
The lecture was concluded with a de
scription of the deathbed repentance of
one who had remained for years away
from the church for the reason that he
hoped through Divine Providence to be
saved at the last moment.-
A MEXICAN GOVERNOR HERE.
General Canedo of Sinaloa Tells of
His State's Prosperity.
General Rafael Canedo; Governor of
Sinaloa, one of the northern States of
Mexico, arrived In this city Tuesday night
and will be at the Occidental for a few
days. General Canedo has served nearly
sixteen years as the chief official of Sina
loa and is just about completing his
fourth term. From other sources it is
learned that the general wil! most likely
be honored once more with the high of- |
flee, as he is held In high esteem by his
people. He came directly from the City '
of Mexico, where he went on state busi- i
ness, the nature of which he did not care ]
to divulge. He will return in five or six
days to Mazatlan. This is not the gen- j
eral's first visit to this coast, as he came i
here six months ago on matters concern- j
ing his Government.
Governor Canedo is the favorite general
of President Diaz of the Mexican repub
lic, 'who has likewise been in office for
sixteen years. They have been compan
ions in several wars and are warm per
sonal friends.
â¢ The mining prospects in our section
are excellent," said General Canedo last
evening, '"and my people are in a very
prosperous condition. There is much more
American capital invested in the northern
portion of Mexico than English, though
!n the central part English Investments
predominate. A syndicate has been
formed for the purpose of building a rail
road from Durango to Mazatlan and the
two places will be connected by rail in
the very near future- The importance of
this line cannot be overestimated and the
citizens are enthusiastic regarding the
contemplated improvement."

THE SENATE AND

In -Next Sunday's Call.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1899.
IN HONOR OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY.
T-" VERY ship in port flew her colors yesterday out of respect for the natal day of "the father of his
I"" 1 country." The battleship lowa was decked from stem to stern with fiags, and a short distance from
iâ Â« her the British ship Centesima made an equally good showing, while the British steamer Moana at Pa
cific-street wharf and the transports Roanoke and Connemaugh were covered with bunting.
During the day the Mexican war veterans visited the lowa. At noon the battleship fired a national
salute, as did also the battel3.es at Fort Point, Black Point and Alcatraz.
YOUNG CLERK IS
RUINED BY FAST
WOMEN AND WINE
Oscar Anderson a
Thief.
WELL KNOWN ON THE FRONT
SOME OF CAPTAIN NELSONS
CASH WENT WITH HIM.
All Ships Observe Washington's
Birthday â Three Boys Have a
Narrow Escape From
Drowning.
Oscar Anderson, a junior clerk and mes
senger employed by Charles Nelson, tne
ship-owner and lumber merchant, is miss
ing. He disappeared last Monday and with
htm went $800 of Captain Nelson's money.
Oscar, although only 18 years old, had
been living a fast life and had got in with
a lot of young fellows who played tne
races and consorted with fast women.
It was to associating with these people
that his fall is due.
Monday last the crew of the steamer
North Fork, owned by Charles Nelson,
was to have been paid off. The cashier
of the house drew a check for $SOO and
sent Anderson to the bank to cash it. He
was told to get gold and a certain amount
of silver. At the same time Oscar was to
call at W. P. Fuller & Co.'s and pay
an account of $450. After the youngster
had been gone an hour the cashier began
to wonder what was the matter. James
Tyson, manager for Charles Nelson, was
taking his lunch at the Merchants' Club
and to him the cashier telephoned, think
ing he might have sent the boy en a mes
sage. Tyson knew nothing about either
Oscar or the money, and another tele
phone message revealed the fact that Os
car had not been to the steamer. When
the bank informed the ship-owner that
the check had been paid in gold, both
Mr Tyson and the cashier came to tne
conclusion that something was wrong.
Monday night and part of Tuesday
everybody in the employ ot Captain i-.el
son thought something had happened to
young Anderson, and none were willing
to think the lad an absconder. \ ester
day, however, a letter postmarked at Su
nol arrived at Charles Nelson's contain
ing W P. Fuller & Co.'s receipt for tne
$450 The police were then notified, ana
Detective Silvey is now on the trail of
the youthful runaway.
"Bad company ruined Oscar, said
James Tyson yesterday. "He left school
about six months ago to come into our
office and soon proved that he possessed
the material for the making of a good
business man. Some blacklegs got hold
of him, however, and he began to go the
pace. I know the boy's relatives well
and the disgrace will be a terrible blow
to them. Both Mr. Nelson and myself
would sooner have lost double the money
than that the boy should have this stain
on his character. The police are now
on his trail and I hope the blacklegs who
tempted him to fall will be made to suf-
The man who is accused of having In
duced young Anderson to rob his em
ployer is William Baker, brother of the
well-known pugilist. He disappeared the
same time that Anderson did and a war
rant is out for- Ills arrest. ihe chances
are that when the two runaways are
caught there will not be much of the
stolen money left. Â«___Â». " *
Three lads named Tom Murphy, An
drew Sundburg and Fred Medder nearly
lost their lives alongside the battle ship
lowa yesterday. They were out in a skiff
and when near the man of war lost one
of their oars overboard. The strong ebb
tide carried them alongside the lowa ana
under a catamaran that was moored to
the warships boom. The youngsters
were swept into the water, but after a
struggle got onto the catamaran. They
remained there shivering for over twenty
minutes, until Henry Peterson in the
launch Amy came along and took them
ashore. The lads are nothing the worse
for their ducking. .
Fish Commissioner Alex Vogelsang
made a haul yesterday. He was on his
way to the battle ship lowa in the launch
Amy, when he saw a Chinese junk, that
had long been suspected of illicit fish
ing coming along. He at once gave
chase and in boarding the junk was re
warded by finding nearly half a ton of
flsh smaller than the law allows to be
caught. The fish were thrown overboard
and all the Chinese nets and lines were
confiscated. Then Commissioner Vogel
sang proceeded to the lowa and paid his
contemplated visit;
"BANTA CRUZ, Feb. 22.â Special to The
Call - The schooner W. S. Phelps re
ported as 'missing' in The Call was in
this harbor last Monday afternoon and
was supplied with provisions by a local
merchant. The Phelps left Monday morn
ing for San Francisco. Captain reports
that he had been thirty-eight days on the
trip owing to the fact that the schooner's
bottom was foul and center board
jammed."
THICK OF A CHINAMAN.
Scheme to Secure Free Passage to
the Old Country.
Jung Chung Chan, a Chinese actor, who
was released on $500 bonds by United
States District Judge de Haven, surren
dered himself last Monday to be deport
ed, he being anxious to return to China,
the charge against him being that of be
ing Illegally within the United Btatea.
Yesterday morning, on motion of Assist- I
ant United States Attorney Banning, the j
court ordered him deported and then de- ;
clared that the hour for the noon recess |
had arrived. Mr. Banning requested the j
court to sign the order for deportation in
order that the Chinaman might depart j
on the steamer which would leave an
ho.ur later, he having promised that If al- ]
lowed to go on that steamer he would :
pay his own fare. But the court checked
Mr. Banning before he could make the
full explanation and announced that he
would sign the order at the opening of
the court at the hour of 2 p. m.
Clerk Morse of the District Court said |
that there was no reason why the China- |
man and his counsel could not have ms.de \
their motion a day or two earlier. It had
become a common practice to bring in
these cases on the last day and expect :
the court to suspend all other business j
for the purpose of attending to them.
Chan will go on the next steamer at the
expense of the Government.
RESTAURANT MEN ON TRIAL.
Maison St. Germain Proprietors Ac
cused of Selling Unstamped
Wine.
Germain Pouchan and Louis Schlatter
were on trial before a Jury yesterday In
the United States District Court for vio
lating the revenue laws. Deputy Internal
Revenue Collectors Fletcher and Worth
told how they had bought several bottles
of wine from the defendants at their
place of business, the Maison St. Ger
main, 33 O'Farrell street. Some of the
bottles were minus the war tax stamp,
and others had been refilled so often that
the stamps they originally bore had been
washed away.
Collector Lynch testified that Pouchan
had admitted to him that the bottles had
been refilled without being restamped.but
that other restaurant men were doing
likewise and that he did not think the
Government officers would attempt to en
force the law until after the Secretary
of the Treasury had passed upon a peti
tion which the restaurant men of San
Francisco had sent to Washington. Pou
chan offered to make a money settlement
with the Government, but Lynch refused
to compromise without first consulting
with the United States Attorney.
Mr. Pouchan took the stand and flatly
contradicted Mr. Lynch. He said he
never made the admission credited to him.
He and his partner had warned the wait
ers against selling- unstamped wine.
There were 100 bottles of wine in a large
box back of the counter, and these were
stamped. By mistake there were a few
unstamped bottles in the box â not intend
ed for sale that day â and tTiese had been
carelessly sold to the revenue officials by
the waiter. .
The case went over until tn-dav.
Assistant United States Attorney Wood
worth is representing the Government,
and the accused are being defended by
i Attorney Bert Schlealnger.
WONG TAN IN DANGER
OF LIFE AND LIBERTY
HE TESTIFIED AGATNST A MUR
DERER, WHO RETALIATES.
Is Arrested for Alleged Perjury, and
"Warned to Stay Away From
Chinatown.
Wong Tan is a victim of the wrath and
enmity of one Ong Foon and the latter' 3
tongs, and now languishes In the City
Prison on a charge of perjury sworn to
by one Ah Joe, who, according to the pris
oner, is a "fake."
Detective Sllvey arrested Tan on Kear
ny street yesterday afternoon at the re
quest of the complaining witness, who
gives his address as 709 Dupont street.
The Incarceration of Wong Tan recalls
a murder and an attempted extortion
case, and according to the prisoner he
has been worried by arrest through his
connection with both affairs.
It appears that Ong Foon was arrested
four or five weeks ago on the complaint
of various Chinese slave owners, and
charged with attempting to extort money
from an inmate of a br.othel. He was dis
charged by Judge Mogan, but while Foon
was leaving the court room he was taken
in custody by &. Deputy Sheriff of Santa
Rosa on a charge of murder he is said
to have committed there.
Vv'ung Tan was a witness to the crime
and ever since has been in danger of
death and annoyance at the hands of Ong
Foon's friends. He has been repeatedly
warned of his danger in coming to San
Francisco, but he has ignored them.
In speaking of his arrest last evening.
Tan, who is an intelligent Chinaman, said
he has not committed perjury, but was
arrested for telling the truth about Ong
Foon's shooting of his friend, Ah Loy, in
November, 1892.
He claims Foon shot Loy in a quarrel
over 50 centa and as he witnessed the
shooting he testified against rhe murder
er. This, ho said, has aroused the enmity
of Ong Foon's friends, and they are many,
as he is a highbinder in high standing,
being a member of the Suey Ying Tong,
Tuey Ling Tong and the Chinese Educa
tion Society.
Tan said that Lieutenant Esola warned
him to look out for himself and stay
away from Chinatown, as he could not
have a man constantly protecting him.
Dr. Voorsanger Talks on Egypt.
Dr. Jacqb Voorsanger addressed the So
ciety of California Pioneer^ on the sub
ject, "Egyptâ Remnants of a Dead Civ

The lecture was illustrated by stereopti
con views. Egypt the speaker character
ized as being a "national tombstone
marking the decay of a nation which laid
the foundation for our present civiliza
tion " This absolute downfall he attrib
uted to lack of morals among the inhab
itants.

it can bÂ« accomplished In a peaceful manner
without exciting a Quarrel with England. Such
grave questions cdll for the wisest statesman

and kidney diseases and malaria call for a

be done with untried medicines -when an old

BURGLAR SILDERS
DETERMINED TO DIE
MAKES ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO
STRANGLE HIMSELF.
Then Tries to Batter His Brains Out
and Is Strapped to a Hospital
Cot.
Charles Silders, alias Loeer, the burg
lar and socialist, made another attempt
to strangle himself In his cell In the City
Prison yesterday morning. He was
again unsuccessful, but feels sure that he
win yet accomplish his purpose.
After his attempt Tuesday a careful
watch was kept upon him. About 8
o'clock yesterday morning he was served
with a cup of coffee and after tfrinklng
it he went to the rear of the cell and
taking a silk necktie which he wore
twisted It round his r.eck and pulling the
ends together again tried to strangle him
self. An alarm was sounded and Ser
geant Lindheimer rushed into the cell and
unloosened the necktie. Silders was pur
ple in the face, and after partially re
covering he beat his head against the ce
ment floor of the cell. He was hand
cuffed and sent to the Receiving Hos
pital.
At the hospital he was placed in a
padded cell and a few minutes later Chief
Steward Bucher observed him attempting
to batter his brains out against the floor.
He was taken from the cell and strapped
down on a cot in the male ward and a
policeman was detailed to watch him.
He refused to take any food and was
compelled to swallow it.
He will bo handed over to tie Sheriff
to-day to be sent to the County Jail to
await his trial on the two charges of
burglars, for whirh Judge Mogan heid
him to answer. The officials in the City
Prison admit that Sihiers is the most des
perate character they have had to deal
with for a long time.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.âWashing
ton's anniversary was observed here
generally to-day. All Government de
partments were closed and also most
ct the stores. There were a number
of patriotic meetings. The National So
ciety of the Children of the Revolution
made their annual celebration, an im
mense crowd thronging Columbia The
ater Mrs. Daniel Lothrop, national
president, called the society to order,
and "America" was sung by the au
dl Rep e resentat"ive Dolliver of lowa was
the oTator of the day. He declared
there was deep philosophy in the pa
triotic training of children, and that
when the children develop into the men
and women of the future their ear y
thoughts and inspiration would tell.
The true American aristocracy Is not
of wealth, family or of social position,
he said, but of patriotism, sacrifice and
gervice.
SETH LOW SCORES
THE WAR DEPARTMENT
: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. Wash
ington's birthday was celebrated here
â with exercises at the Academy of Music
under the auspices of the University of
Pennsylvania, Some 2000 students
inarched in procession and enlivened
the day -with their college songs and
class slogans. The exercises at the
academy opened with prayer by Bishop
Ozi and the students in chorus sang
the national hymn "America" and the
university hymn "Hall. Pennsylvania
The orator of the occasion was Setn
iJw. 6 LL D.. president of Columbia
University. His topic was "The United
States ; 1899." Mr. Low dwelt at length
Spon ihe recent war with Spain, say
ing in part: _
Th . mechanical skill and ready effl
organization and for business had dis

HÂ«nK^Sra^eTn l^^ r^
Everything that foil to the lot of the-navj
*o do was done quietly, without confusion
and win absolute success. In the army
ft did riot It must in all candor be ad
mitted hat the task of the War Depart
ment was much the heavier It had to
multiply the army tenfold and It had to
do quickly on a large scale what it had
only been "in the habit of doing slowly on a
BI But lt a is* precisely under such circum
etances that cvuiufa shows, and we are
obliged to admit that on the side of the
War Department the genius that had
made our railroads the most effective in
the world, the genius that is enabling our
manufacturers to conquer the markets of
the world, was not forthcoming. The
Santiago campaign of the army was
splendidly and brilliantly successful, and
if the war bad lasted longer I dare say
we should have had a better criterion
than we have now by which to judge how
much of the dreadful suffering in camp
and field is inseparable from war at the
very best. But the contrast between the
Work of the Navy Department and the
"War Department is too great to be wholly
explained away. It is as clear as the
noonday sun that the organization of
the War Department and the army is ab
solutely unfriendly to efficiency. The
President's commission to investigate has
pointed out some of the difficulties and
has suggested some of the remedies. It
remains for public opinion to see that
the remedies or others equally effective
are promptly enacted into law. I am glad
that the President has appointed a court
of inquiry to go to the bottom of the
grievous charges that have been made
- against the commissary department, for
it is hideously in contrast with the self
sacrificing heroism of our troops that
guch charges can be mooted, much less
Made by the commanding general of the
army. Now that the inquiry has been
ordered the people may well await the
finding with patience and with an open
mind, as a people at once too great to do
injustice even to a single one not known
to be at fault and too earnest to permit
atiy who may be proven guilty either of
. â wrongdoing or of false charges to escape
the blazing fury of that wrath.
. Mr. Low upheld the course of the ad
ministration In the Philippines.

FRIENDS HELPED HIM
BREAK INTO PRISON
James Donohue Petitions Judge Mogan to Send
Him to Jail and the Court Favors Him.
San Francisco, Feb. 14, 1899.
To Hon. Judge Mogan â Dear
Sir: Mr. James Donohue, carpet
layer by trade, has been drink
ing heavily for some timÂ« and
wants to try and reform, but
it seems that he has passed the
point where he can control him
self. We think it would be a
just and kind act to detain him
for sixty days and let him try
and mend his ways. iTours re
spectfully,

The above is an unusual document,
considering that the principal there
in drew it with hla own pen and then
secured the signature thereto. Don
ohue had been drfnking heavily, as
the document attests. He could not
reform, as is further set forth, and
decided that a prison cell would
work results equally as good ac any
"booze" institute. So he set about
getting- himself into jail. The oc
cupation of keeping out of jail year
ly interests a goodly percentage of
our population. Pickpocket Piggott,
of course, being among those ex
cepted, but when the public is forced
to witness the efforts of a man try
ing to break into Jail it simply tilts
back on its chair and awaits re
sults. Donohue is game, however.
He wanted to go to jail and he went,
but he hasn't been back since.

at the head of Brown Gulch and ran
right over the Seven Thirty mine and
partly across the Dunderburg. The min
ers who were burled under the snow were
caught asleep in their cabins. An alarm
was quickly given and a rescuing party
at once began digging for bodies.

"Keith's." Come one, come all. â¢
a man of 30 can be called young, ap
peared in Judge Mogan's court. He
was about "half shot" and after a
nervous glance around approached
the bench. Judge Mogan took from
his hands the petition and after
catching his breath aaked where
Donohue could be found. "I am the
man you want," said the owner of
the petition, and Judge Mogan again
reached for air. The court said
nothing; his soul was too full of
emotion for words. Motioning to the
bailiff lie handed him the petition,
waved his hand in the direction of
Donohue and gasped "Twenty-four
hours." Donohue was led away by
the bailiff to a cell, content. By
this time Judge M'ogan had recov
ered and informed the bailiff that in
event Donohue wanted .more he was
again to be brought before the court
and sentence would be forthcoming.
Donohue evidently had his fill, how
ever, for when the cell door opened'
for him he lit out and has not re
turned. Although an appetite for
the demon rum that is past control
is not to be desired, it is regarded
by many as preferable to a prison
cell, and this Donohue doubtless
discovered. Hence his absence.
The story of Donohue's success
ful effort to break into jail has its
pathetic as well as humorous
phases. He is the brother of David
Donohue, who was shot and killed
during the duel between Martin
Kelly and Billy Harrington, which
occurred some' ten years ago in the
Republican county committee rooms.
The murdered man was but a spec
tator, not a participant in the fight,
and when his brother, who peti
tioned the court to be sent to jail,
looked upon his body in the public
charnel house, he was a changed
man. From a life of sobriety and
regularity he turned to drink and
now, when remorse of conscience
seized him, he went to his friends
and they signed the document that
closed upon him temporarily a
prison door.
"IS GEORGE
WASHINGTON A
BACK NUMBER?"
Ringing Oration of H.
E. Highton-
PATRIOTISM AT TABERNACLE
Y. M. I. DAY CELEBRATED WITH
ENTHUSIASM.
The Necessity of Upholding the Con
stitution Insisted Uponâ Work
of the Order at the '
Front.
OAKLAND, Feb. 22.â ThÂ© Tabernacle
was crowded to-night, the occasion be
ing the celebration of Y. M. I. day by
Counclls Nos. 6, 8 and 31 of the Young:
Men's Institute. Chairman W. V. Har
rington In a few preliminary remarks
paid a tribute to George Washington and
to the progress which his patriotism made
possible. He referred to the fact that
Colonel James Smith, Father MoKinnon
and others of the institute had fully up
held the motto of the order, "Pro deo,
pro patria," on the battlefields of the
Philippines.
Miss Agnes Fitton and Miss Marlon Fit
ton, two young ladits, were encored for
some very clever violin and piano work.
A. C. Read, James J. Rosborough, Miss
Irene Lenoir, Miss Hattie Savage and
George P. Clark supplied a very appro
priate programme of recitation and song.
Hon. Henry E. Highton delivered the
oration of the evening, taking for his
theme "Expansion â Is Washington a
Back Number?" He said in brief:
"This question involves our Institutions
and our constitution. What are the star 3
and stripes of our flag if they are not
the symbols of the principles which
Washington represented? Destroy the
principles of the constitution and what
does that flag represent? I confess that
when 1 read that some members of Con
gress in 1599 said that Washington
lived In a different age and that his pre
cedents are not for us, the true citizen
rebels and rises In denunciation of such
sentimentÃ. Our subject embraces the ac
quisition of the Philippine Isiands with
its nine or ten millions of barbarous
hordes, Incapable of being raised to the:
dignity of American citizenship. Our dec
laration declares that all men are cre
ated equalâ that includes the Filipinosâ
and are endowed with certain Inalienable
rights.
One of these rights is that of being
governed by a government deriving its
power from the will of the governed. We
declined to be governed except with our
consent. We fought one of the greatest
wars in history with Washington at our
head because of our belief in this prin
ciple. We were either right or wrong.
We cannot treat the Filipinos as we re
â  fused to be treated or else we attack the
i fundamental principles of our existence
as a nation. This would, of course,
be unconstitutional, and so we are told
that the constitution framed in the con
vention of which George Washington was
President is a back number.
"That constitution, like the Ten Com
mandments, is eternal as eternity itself.
When Washington and those other great
men framed the constitution they had
before them the example of the Roman
Empire and what led to its downfall, and i
they were guided thereby. Washington I
did not contemplate what we have seen
during the past year. He never dreamed
that attempts would be made to over- :
ride the constitution without even the
pretense of an amendment. And not a
single sentiment of George Washington
was not reiterated and held Inviolate by '
the great Lincoln.
"Uncle Sam needs no British alliance
to secure to him a fair share of the !
trade and the profits of the Pacific. He ;
needs no "open door," which is but the
British invitation to the American fly to
enter John Bull's parlor. I would like
to hear from some of our budding states
men of one scintilla of Justification in
the constitution for the acquisition of
such territoryâ the Philippines, with mil
lions of a mongrel horde. Should we an
nex the Philippines nothing can prevent
any or all of these Filipinos from coming j
to "any other part of the United States.
Capitalists, hunting cheap labor, might
find a way, but the constitution can np\vr I
do it. We have no provision that would j
enable us to establish colonial govern- j
ments or to annex Asiatic territory and
Asiatic hordes."
MIDWEEK MENTION OF
PLAYS AND MUSIC
"The Sign of the Cross" continues the
principal topic cf discussion among the
play-goers, and the Columbia Theater will
prosper serenely as long as the discussion
lasts. From both scenic and histrionic
points of view the production is admira
ble, but the play itself is nothing better
than a sensational caricature of Chris
tianity and decency. It will" run the rÂ«st
of this and all of next week.
About the most satisfactory entertain
ment in the town is offered in the Tivoli,
where a good stock company is giving a
good performance of "Madeleine, or the
Magic Kiss," a recent comic opera of
more than usual merit.
The revival of "The Girl I Left Behind
Me" Is making out a lively week at the
Alcazar.
The introduction of several new turns
makes the Orpheum bill much cleverer
than it was last week. The cleverest of
the newcomers are J. K. Murray ana
Clara Lane, who present a unique comic
opera skit.
The last symphony concert of the sea
son will be given in the Orpheum this aft
ernoon, when Dvorak's symphony. The
New World," will form the chief item of
the programme. In consequence of un
expected delay in transit, copies of Tscha
lkowaky's "Pathetique Symphony, which
waa announced for this concert, failed to
arrive In time for rehearsal, and a change
of programme became necessary. The sec
ond half of the concert will be devoted to
the works of Wagner, including the pre
lude to the third act of "The Meistersing
er"- Siegfried's funeral march, from
"Ootterdammerung," and the overture to
"Tannhauser."
After almost a week of darkness the
Comedy Theater will be reopened Satur
day night by John L. Sullivan, the re
formed pugilist, and a company of vaude
ville players.
For her engagement of one week at the
California Theater, beginning next Mon
day evening. Nance O'Nell will present
the following repertoire: Monday and
Thursday evenings, 'Magda ; Tuesday
and Sunday nights, the new East
Lynne." Miss O'NeiL appearing here for
the first time as Lady Isabel; Wednesday,
"Ingomar": Friday. "The Jewess ; Sat
urday matinee, "Camille 1 ; Saturday
night, "Oliver Twist." Treasurer . Louis
A Morgenstern of the California Theater
is to be tendered a complimentary benefit
at that houae on Friday evening when
the Black Patti Troubadours will give
some special features. A large house will
testify to Mr. Morgenstern s popularity.
Another amateur ballet at the Chutes
to-night. Why not try â¢ something:new
an amateur cake-walk, for instance?
Pickpockets at Work.
During the police parade yesterday
'morning pickpockets mingled with the
crowd and actively plied their vocation.
Miss Mary McGowan, 9^ Laske street,
reported at the Southern station that
while standing at Market street and
Golden Gate avenue a young man stole
her purse which contained $15 In gold, $1
in silver and two keys. He ran into
Kapp & Street's saloon and she chased
him, but he disappeared through the exit
into Golden Gate avenue and was lost to
sight.

the chair appointed A. D. Lemon, Clitus
Barbour, Charles Glldea, Max Popper, T.
J. Crowley, Raleigh Bancar, George Roe,
P. A. Byrne, John McCann and A. Bailey.
After consultation the committee sub
mitted a declaration of principles; the
platform adopted at the Chicago conven
tion of 1896 was reaffirmed and fully in
dorsed; the early construction of the
Nicaragua canal and its ownership, by
the United States was recommended:
thanks were extended to the army and
navy for their distinguished services and
their signal victories on land and sea.
The resolution further recommended the
public ownership of public utilities; the
election of United States Senator by di
rect vote of the people; a policy of peace
with all nations, while scrupulously
maintaining the rights of our own Gov
ernment. The resolutions were adopted
in full.
A special committee, consisting of J.
Meado, Thomas Walsh, Max Popper, J.
R. Avis, A. J. McMahon. J. H. Zeman
sky, Joseph Gorman. W. M. Cannon, John
Kavanagh and E. Hayden. was appointed
for the purpose of extending the organ
ization by Assembly districts and ar
ranging for the celebration of the semi
centennial of Democracy's birth In this
State on October 25, 1899. The chair was
empowered to appoint a celebration com
mittee of fifteen, which will assume
charge of the entire matter. Ttje mem
bers will be appointed later and will con
fer with a similar committee already
chosen by the Iroquois Club of this city.
Grand Sachem John C. Ruddock of
Ukiah in his report explained- the plan
which was adopted last year to extend thtÂ»
league and which provides for the forma
tion of an Iroquois lodge In each of the
eighty Assembly districts of the State.
Every club, when organized, is to send
five representatives to the annual State
conference. According to Grand Sachem
Ruddock the work is progressing well,
but is Very far from completion.
Grand Treasurer Louis Metzger's report
showed receipts of $157 30; disbursements.,
$69 25, leaving a balance of $8S 05.
On motion of Max Popper a new office
j to be known as State organizer was cre
ated, article IV of the constitution being
amended to that effect.
The election of officers to serve for the
cmulng year then took place. Grand
Sachem J. C. Ruddock was placed in
nomination In a eulogistic speech, but ne
withdrew In favor of the other nominee,
George H. Cabaniss, who was elected by
a rising vote. This last formality was
observed In the election of the other oi
ficers. who are as follows: Mcc grand
sachem. Frank Lvman of Sacramento.

District, Clitus Barbour of Fourth
trlct and John Kavanaugh of Fifth Dis
trict.
After the auditing of bills which had
been incurred during the past year the
delegates were enterrtrltred by some ora
torical flights as to what were the best
methods to be followed to Insure Demo
cratic success, the general belief being
that organization rather than reorgan
ization of the party was essential. Max
Popper waxed eloquent over the coming
celebration of Democracy's birth in tne
State and urged the enlistment of every
Democrat in California in the cause.
Raleigh Barcar, Major E. Lewis. Judge
A. D Lemon. J. C. Ruddock and Charles
Gildea followed In a similar strain, and
the convention adjourned until next
Washington's birthday. Â«,ââ¦__
In the evening the visiting delegates
were the guests of the Iroquois Club of
this city at a banquet given at
Delmonico's. over which Judge RÂ° b frt
Ferral presided. Covers were laid for 150.

Robert B. Smith, Governor of Montana.

ganization of mothers which meets
monthly at the Stanford kindergarten
rooms, corner Twenty-ninth and Mission

by giving the children of the kindergarten
a dinner on Tuesday. After brief pat
riotic exercises about eighty-five children

â¢ This honest tribute from a stanch ad
mirer could not have been bestowed upon
a worthier recipient, for Sergeant Bro
phy looked a policeman, every inch of
him, as he marched up Market street
yesterday at the head of a platoon in the
annual parade of the Police Department,
the envy of his brother officers, the
adored of every chambermaid along the
line of march. To be sure, Brophy is
somewhat shy on inches, and somewhere
along the line of march he 'must have
lust the carefully folded newspaper he
â wears under the sweatband of his cap for
obvious reasons, allowing his headgear to
settle down over nis ears and rest on his
Bhoulders in a manner that must have
been annoying, to say the least; but all
the same, Brophy was all right.

Miss Mary Butterworth, Who Jilted George Heazelton to
Wed Another, Weds Her First Love.

HEAZETVTON-HOWE-In New York City, i
February 14, at. the house of Dr. St. John j
Roosa, 20 East Thirtieth street, by the Rev. "f
Marvin R. Vincent,' D.D., George Heazel- 1
ton of Ran Francisco, Cad., and Mary But- j
! terworth Howe, daughter of Mrs. Benjamin <j
Butterworth. _ _ !.' v- ;- : : J
A romance that- a novelist would have<
' reveled in led up to the foregoing sim- J
.ple marriage announcement which re- i
cently appeared in the local papers. It*
was the second time that Mr. Heazelton 4
had wooed his bride and won her con-,
sent to be his wife, and now she Is his
"for better or for worse." â'..,.,. ;. v
Every member of the Bohemian Club, every newspaper man and nearly all
"â¢She business community of San Francisco knows George Heazelton. He was for
.a time proprietor of the Post and later has been Washington correspondent
it different San Francisco papers at various times. .It was shortly before he
secured the Post that Mr. Heazelton met Miss Mary Butterworth, daughter of
Congressman Benjamin Butterworth of Ohio. The young lady's parents, fa
vored the match and she herself was not averse to the wooing. When every
thing was shaping itself to the desired end- Mr. Heazelton had to come to Cali
fornia and assume control of the Post. He started for San Francisco with the
understanding that when the paper was on a paying basis the wedding was. to
take place. â¢
Durine the life of Congressman Butterworth his confidential . clerk was a
man named Howe. The clerk was madly in love with Miss Mary and some say
that before the advent of Heazelton this feeling had been reciprocated. During
the absence of Heazelton in California Howe was taken sick, and in an un
guarded moment confessed his love for Miss Butterworth. The young lady
then discovered the true state of her heart â  and at once broke off â  her engage
ment with Mr. Heazelton. Then, in spite of the protests of her relatives and
friends, she married Mr. Howe on what proved to be his deathbed. In fact, the
poor fellow only lived a few hours after he and his sweetheart had been made
''Faint heart never won fair lady," and no one ever accused George Heazel
ton of being faint hearted. He continued a good friend of tne Butterworth
fÃrnilv and when the Congressman died he was there to sorrow with the widow
'"i daughter. Years passed and still no word of love passed his lips. Finally
his patience and devotion won the day and Mrs. Butterworth-Howe Is cow
lira. George Heazelton.
For that matter, so were all the oth
ers in line, for the police made a hand
some appearanc far outstripping any
previous effort. Maybe it was the drum
corps, possibly it was due to the fact
that all the commissioned officers and the
sergeants and corporals discarded their
clubs and adorned' themselves with brirnt
new swords for the occasion, but what
ever it was, the column made a fine
showing.
Now, there was Chief Lees, for instance,
with his trousers tucked into his boots
and looking like a fantastically adorned
sack of bran wobbling around on the back
of his horse. The Chief didn't have time
to get his boot legs striped with gold leaf
and there is no room on his uniform for
any more braid, but he had an extra
stripe of broad gold lace stitched on his
saddle blanket, and with his nice new
saber (an involuntary presentation from
the patrolmen) .he was quite modestly
and becomingly arrayed. The Chief did
not lead the drum corps; the drummers
led the Chief. It is whispered out at the
hall that Wittman had considerable diffi
culty in persuading the old man that his
proper place as commander in chief was
immediately behind the music and that
it would be undignified to ride in front
and carry a drum major's baton. Any
way, the Chief looked quite au fait and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1899.
exceedingly happy.
Lieutenant Birdsall rode with the Chief
to see that no disaster befell him, while
Captains Wittman and Spillane were aJso
mounted.
The column formed on Market street be
low Montgomery and, surprising to relate,
moved to the minute fixed upon.
Behind a platoon of mounted police
from the Seventeenth street station there
were three barouches. Ordinarily they
serve as the common hacks of commerce,
but in parades they are always barouches.
In the first were Mayor Phelan and Po
lice Commissioner Tobin, while the sec
ond contained Commissioners Alvord and
Gunst. And speaking of beautiful butter
flies, it is only necessary to remark that
Mose looked the part. His silk hat was
as glossy and modish as that worn by the
banker and. tipped rakishly over the left
eye, it showed Mose was fully alive to the
occasion and determined not to be out
done by his fellow-members. In the third
carriage rode ex-Chief Crowley and Dr.
J. W. Keeney, examining surgeon of the
department.
Following the carriages was Casassa's
First Regiment band in gorgeous red uni
forms that sent a temporary thrill of
envy through the breast of the aged Chief
and* eight members of the famous drum
corps, pounding away and watching for
bricks.
The Chief and Birdsall came next and
MAC'S MELODY
WON THE FINE
SILVER CUP
Exciting Coursing at
Ingleside Park.
THE DENVER DOG A CHAMPION
FLYAWAY, THE RUNNER-UP,
WAS HARD TO BEAT.
The Largest Crowd of the Season Wit
nessed the Championship Event
From Betting 1 Ring and
Grand Stand.
The largest and assuredly the most
appreciative crowd of sport-lovers that
has heretofore witnessed a coursing
meeting in this State was present yester
day at the Ingleside Coursing Park to
witness the grand meeting upon which
was dependent the club's coursing cup
and several cash prizes.
The coursing was exceptionally good
because of the excellent condition of the
hares and hounds. The betting was par
ticularly brisk throughout the day.
Captain Clarkson opened with three
boxes, but before half of the day's sport
was completed he was perforce obliged
to add two more boxes to relieve "the at
tack" upon what he considered a suffi
cient complement of boxes for a holiday
meeting.
The interest attached to the sport of
the day was of course centered on the
final race between two of the grandest
performers of the stake, viz., Mac's
Melody and Flyaway. Gamekeeper
Harry Murray reserved one of the old
time "hard-to-catch" "jacks" for this es-
pecial race, and it g-ocs without saying
that the final course will long be remem
bered by the fraternity as being one of
the most stubbornly contested events In
the history of local coursing.
The betting was even for quite a while,
then It turned slightly In favor of Mac's
Melody, the closing odds being $10 to $9,
with Flyaway on the short end.
To an excellent slip Mac's led slightly
and was first to reach game. The hare
favored Mac's Melody, and she having
gained the inside Flyaway had to take
the outer circle, thus giving her oppo
nent an opportunity to score several
points
Flyaway finally took charge of the
game at the upper end of the field and
it was there that the prettiest work of
the day was witnessed. It was give and
take, both dogs scoring In their turn.
Flyaway, by a gTand effort, rushod in
and killed rather too quickly, and the flag
went up proclaiming Mac's Melody the
winner of the beautiful cup and first
prize, the score being 21 to 14.
The winner is owned by Bartell Bros,
of Denver, Colo. She is twenty-two
months old and is by Boodler Rufflan-
Brilliante. She Is in charge of Billy Mc-
Gibbon and has been trained for this es
pecial meeting by Joe Thrift, the non^
pariel conditioner of greyhounds, who Is
at present looking after a large kennel
of dogs in Frultvale, Alameda.
The results of the great meeting are
appended:
Innrleside Coursing: Club cup stake and $150 to
winner; Yunner up, $100; third, $70; next two

then Captain Wittman and Company A
swung along. This was tne largest com
mand in line and included detachments
from the California street, O'Farrell
street and North End stations. The m<-n
were all armed with rifles and looked fit
for combat with an army.
Bennett's band and eight more mem
bers of the drum corps headed Captain
Spillane's company, which turned out
strong numerically and showed the bene
ficial results of that efficient officer's
careful handling.

POLICE PUZZLED BY
A PARK "MYSTERY"
Some of the Articles Which Are Putting the
Department on Its Mettle.
THE park police were mystified yesterday by the discovery' near the McAllis
ter street entrance of a number of articles of gentleman's attire in good
condition. Rumors of a possible suicide, connected with the names of Lieu
tenant Neall and others, were speedily afloat, but a close examination of the
articles tended to allay apprehension, while not solving the mystery.
The items of attire consisted of a light melton pvercoat, a black diagonal
cutaway coat and vest and a brown Derby hat, all in good condition. With
them were two cuff buttons of a sporting character, and In the pockets of the
clothes were two cigars and some advertising cards. One bore a calligraphic
scrollwork accompanied by the words, "Darling P. M.," and an address on Turk
street.
It was suggested that some premature celebrant of the day devoted to the
great and only George had wandered into the park, and imagining himself in his
own palatial apartment had shed his raiment and gone to bed. In the morning
he had haply arisen to seek his dressing room and had lost his way and belong
ings.
But the park police shake the-ir heads ominously and mutter "mystery" and
talk of "clews."

Company C, Captain Dunlevy, with Ser

up from the city front, the harbor po
lice making a most creditable appear
ance. Behind them were the eight pa
trol wagons of the department, giving a
decidedly businesslike appearance to the
turnout, and sending shivers down the
spines of too enthusiastic celebrants.
Down Montgomery street, to Califor
nia, to Kearny, to Market and out that
thoroughfare to Van Ness avenue
marched the police, the streets being
thronged with spectators. On the ave
nue the column proceeded as far as
Geary street and then countermarched
to Hayes street. Line was formed for
review and the Commissioners, accompa
nied by Chief Lees and Lieutenant Bird
sail passed up and down before the men.
Then they took station and the police
marched in review In column of platoons,
after which the tired officers went home
and doctored their blistered feet, for they
had done far more walking than usually
falls to a policeman in one day.

At Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22.â ThÂ© Wash
ington's birthday coursing- meet at Agri
cultural Park brought out a large attend
ance despite the counter attractions.
Owing to the presence of General Shatter
in the city only a 32-dog stake was run,
so as to give all the citizens a chance
to see the parade in the morning, and the
coursing did not commence until about
noon. The features of the day were the
phenomenal performances of Stella B,
Bunnell's game little bitch, and the de
feat of Kitty Scott by Orpheum Lass.
Passons, however, captured first money
with Queen Reef, with Stella B second,
Orpheum Lass third and Fleetfoot fourth.
Assistant Fire Chief Ed Smith leaves
for San Francisco to-night with Kitty
Scott and Mountain Belle, who are en
tered in the John Grace cup race.

The handicaps given were two-thirds of
those that the players would receive at
medal play. In the second round the
players were paired as follows: H. Bab
cock versus H. D. Pillsbury; E. J. Mc-
Cutchen versus J. W. Byrne, and H. B.
Goodwin versus J. D. Harvey. The match
will be concluded on Saturday.
Play commenced on the Oakland links
at 10 o'clock in the morning and continued
throughout the day. The mixed four
somes, the earlier rounds of which were
played last Saturday, were concluded. In
the last round Miss Alice Moffltt and P.
E. Bowles Jr., aftor a close contest, de
feated Mrs. W. Pierce Johnson and P. E.
Bowles.
The event of the day. however, on the
Adams Point links was men's foursomes,
at nine holes. Ten pairs entered, and the.
game was played on this principle: ten
subtracted from sixteen (the nearest pow
er of 2 above ten) gives six: accordingly
six pairs drew byes, leaving four pairs in
the preliminary round, which resulted
thus: J. A. Folger and Rlckard defeated
Hubbard and Ames, while E. R. Folger
and Horace Miller suffered defeat at the
hands of Fitzgerald and Knowles.
In the second round there were eight
pairs, who played with the following re
sults: Hutchinson and Greenwood defeat
ed Pierce and Magee; Bowles and Requa
defeated Cooke and McNear; MeKee and
McDonald won from Taft and Bowles Jr.,
while J. A. Folger and Rickard were vic
torious over Fitzgerald and Knowles. Of
the four pairs left in the third round
Hutchinson and Greenwood beat Bowles
and Requa, and MeKee and McDonald
defeated J. A. Folger and Rickard. In
the final round Hutchinson and Green

1 up, and won the competition, for which
prizes purchased with the entrance fee*
