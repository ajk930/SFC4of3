Accusations Do Not Have an Opportunity

CALL HE.' DQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. Friday after
noon the investigating committee
will make its report to the As
sembly. The report will not in
clude any findings relative to the grave
accusations that have been made
against Assemblyman Cosper. chair
man of the committee. Now that the
work of the committee is at an end
Chairman' Cosper is being made the
target for the criticism o. all men In
the Legislature who have regard for
justice and who believe. in punishing
such men as are guilty of having ac
cepted bribes or who have solicited
bribes in connection with their vote for
United. Statâ Senator. , : â¢ â¢*Â«Ys'i
During the course of the investiga
tion that has now been brought to a
close the accusation was made to the
Investigating committee that its chair
man. Assemblyman Cosper. had.
through an agent, solicited a bribe of
$6000 from Milton J. Green. ; political
' manager of U. S. Grant. It was alleged \
that the agent was Charles G. Lamber
ton, an attorney of Visalia. According
to the story told to the committee.
Lamberson went to Green and told him
that Cosper had received an offer of
$6000 to vote ff D. M. Burns for Sena
tor; that Cosper did not want to vote
for Burns, but desired to vote for
Grant; that if Cosper did vote for
Grant he deemed it no more than right
that Grant should treat him eaually as
well financially as Burns had offered
to treat him. Green refused the offer.
and Lamberson was dismissed.
A subpena was issued for Lamberson,
but it was held up for two days. In
the meantime Cosper refused : to allow
the Investigation commmitttee to hold
a meeting. So much indignation was j
expressed at this action that an order j
was finally issued to serve the sub- '-
pena. This was done last Sunday. Up
to the present time Lamberson has re
fused to obey the official order ef'thel
committee. He sent a message to the
effect that he was engaged in the trial i
of an important case and could not at- I
tend on the committee on Monday,;, but i
OWEN WADE DURING THE DEBATE ON THE REPORTS OF THE CONTESTED ELECTIONS COMMITTEE.
The San Francisco Call.
would be on hand to-day without fail.
To-day passed and Lamberson
failed to appear. ' Cosper admits
communication with Lamberson by
telephone since Sunday, which,
to say the least, is a peculiar
proceeding on the part of the chairman
of an investigating committee who is
himself the person to be investigated.
Milton J. Green, the person of whom
the bribe is said to have been solicited,
is in Sacramento, though he is con
fined to his room by a temporary ill
ness. No steps have been taken by the
committee; to ascertain the exact state
of Green's health, and Âno_v._ffort-J_a_.
been made to take his deposition. On
the contrary, the investigation has been
hurried to a close, the evident intention
being, to drop the accusation against
Cosper without investigation.
Milton J. Green will testify, if he Is
called to the witness-stand, that Lam
berson was brought to him by Thomas
Nosier, and that Lamberson made the
proposition exactly as has been set
forth in the accusation against Cosper.
Nosier Is in Sacramento and will tes
tify to taking Lamberson to Green.
Although Cosper has been voting for
Bulla for Senator, it is well known that
he is one of Burns' adherents and that
he will switch his vote to the railroad's
candidate when he is ordered to do so.
He has held frequent secret conferences
'with Burns both before and since the
accusation ' concerning the solicitation
of the $6000 bribe. ' ' J Vi-"
The meetings of the committee this
afternoon and this evening were held
behind closed doors because it was not
thought advisable to allow the public
to see and hear how the committee pro
posed to arrange its report to the As
sembly. At. the initial session this af
ternoon there was some discussion as
what should be- done to secure the at
tendance of Assemblyman Dale 'and
Mr. Lamberson, but Cosper counseled
delay and the matter was postponed.
Cosper said, he felt sure that Lam
berson did not mean to avoid the pro
tess of the committee and that he
would.be on hand during' the course of
the present week.
SAN 'FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1899.
The afternoon and evening 1 were oc
cupied by the committee "in' 1 preparing
the report that is to be presented to the
Assembly Friday afternoon ' unless
something intervenes to prevent it. :
With the exception of. Chairman Gos
per, the members of the committee are
practically agreed upon the scope and
nature of this report. If :_- minority
report is submitted to the "Assembly it
will bear only the signature of .Chair
man Cosper and possibly Mr. Mellick.
The majority report as agreed upon
will set forth that Speaker Wright re
ceived $1650 from U. S. Grant through
his political manager, Milton J. Green.
The evidence substantiating this fact
will be submitted with the report and
the Assembly will be. left to deal with
its Speaker as it sees fit.
DE YOUNG NOT TOO ILL,
BUT JUST ILL ENOUGH
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 25.â One of the -witnesses
that have failed to appear before the As
sembly investigating committee in re
sponse to a subpena is M. H. de Young,
proprietor of the San , Francisco Chroni
cle. The subpena for Mr. de Young was
issued on Saturday, last and was served
on him the following day, January 22. On
Monday Mr. de Young sent a doctor's
certificate to the effect that he was suf
fering from la grippe, and that his health
would not permit. of a trip to Sacramento
The certificate bore date of January 21
the day before . the subpena was served
on him. .
A letter just received here throws some
light on this circumstance. It reads: "I
see that General Mike de Young sends a
certificate that he is too ill to go to Sac
ramento. As a matter of fact, he spent
last Sunday afternoon at the Golf Club
near San Rafael, and put in several hours :
at that aristocratic and therefore conge
nial sport. So far as health and agility
are concerned, I never saw Mike In bet
ter shape, and his light, girlish figure was
admired by some of our best people. Tell
Maj. McLaughlin that I think Mike has
gone into training for a ! set-to ; with him,
which now appears inevitable, and t from
the way Mike is showing up he promises
to be very formidable. His leg develop
ment is truly wonderful, and I doubt very,
much if the major is ever able to â  reach
him."
IMPORTANT BILL

CALL HEADQUARTERS,' _ SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 25.â Senator Stratton has
introduced a bill which provides . that
Boards of Supervisors or City Councils
of counties and cities may grant to a
railroad corporation authority to con

fight against poolrooms and poolselling.
The bill which he introduced in the As
sembly this morning is primarily intended

ARGUING AGAINST THE
TAXATION OF SCHOOLS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 25.â David Starr Jor
dan, president of Stanford University,
and Lyman Abbott,, professor of law at
the same institution, were before the As
sembly Committee on Judiciary this even
ing to argue constitutional amendment 2,
which proposes to exempt Stanford Uni
versity and its direct income-producing
properties from taxation. Dr. McCUsh
of the University of the Pacific and Rev.
Dr. Bogard of Santa Rosa -were also
resent to urge the committee to so
broaden the scope of the proposed amend
ment . that it . would . bring under the
exemption all schools not conducted for
the purpose of producing pecuniary
profit.
Dr. Jordan argued the proposition at
length and stated that If the tax were
taken off the Stanford property the so
called "registration fee" now charged
could be withdrawn and the tuition be
rendered absolutely free. Both Dr. Jor
dan and Professor Abbott argued that
the original intent of California's insti
tution, was to exempt free institutions of
learning from taxation.
Dr. McClish and Dr. Bogard argued the
amendment to i the measure offered re
cently by Cobb of San Francisco. The
amendment provides that all school
houses,- academies, colleges, universities
and seminaries of learning, with the
books and furniture therein, where tne
management thereof is not for pecuniary
profit, and the grounds attached to said
buildings necessary for their proper oc
cupancy, use and enjoyment, and not
leased or otherwise used with a view to
profit, are exempt from taxation.
The committee heard the denomlnation
alists-through, and then passed to the
constitutional' amendment ; drafted by
Johnson of Sacramento annd designed to
create an â â  appellate court for the State
of s Califo.-niR. General ' Chipman, one of
'the 'Supreme, Court Commissioners, was
on hand to talk the measure over with the
committee, but- action was deferred and

CENSURE IS TO
BE DOLED OUT
IN MILD DOSES
Green, Grant and the Speaker Will
Be Rebuked Lightly.
A MINORITY REPORT IS FEARED.
After a Stormy and Lengthy Session the Committee of
Investigation Decides to Send in a Pre*
liminary Report.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 25.â The Assembly com
mittee investigating the charges against
Speaker Howard E. Wright ' will not
give that worthy a complete white
wash. j.y '
The "Honorable" Speaker, of the As
sembly, the committee will find, so it
is stated late to-night, has, in accept
ing $1650 at the hands of U. S. Grant
Jr., a candidate for United States Sen
ator, been guilty of a practice which
if indulged in by every member of the
Legislature could not in any' way be
considered as in^he interests ] of pure
government or an honest, fair and in
corruptible election of a United States
Senator by the Legislature. ;V : . t : .
-- The committee of investigation had
a session this' evening that lasted until
after midnight, and it was more or less
warm. ; ' s ''" '. ." 'â¢''â ".'.' . .'.''â¢'-â¢â â 
It seems ' that some members of the
committee are agreed upon the propo
sition that "Mr. Speaker" should be un
conditionally whitewashed. But, on the
other hand, there are either three or
four members who insist that to white
wash Wright would give approval to
the practice of Mr. Grant's managers
in assisting in the election of certain
members of the Legislature.
These same members of the commit
tee who are willing to vote in favor of
whitewashing Wright are also in favor
of severely censuring Milton J. Green
for paying out money in aid of the elec
tion .of a Republican Legislature and
distributing the money in various dis
tricts. â¢ . . : ' '.: '- fy*y
The members who are opposed to a
complete exoneration of Wright argue
that if Mr. Green and Mr. Grant are to
be condemned, - and they think both of
them should be, Mr. Wright as a re
cipient of $900 from Green, which he
admits was given him to assist in his
nomination, should also come in for his
share of rebuke. '.-....-
What the chairman of the committee
and Mr. Mellick are very anxious to
avoid is a minority report,' and they
will, in all probability, give a point or
two as regards Wright in order to in
sure a report signed by every member
of the committee^ . . ./" ;
. Upon two points the -committee -is
agreed. - The report will censure Milton
J. Green for distributing money he
did to insure what he is pleased to term
the election of j a Republican- Legisla
ture. But inasmuch as Mr. Green . ad
mitted that he was using the , money of
U. S. Grant Jr. for this purpose the
committee will probably look upon Mr.
Green's distribution as an attempt to
unduly influence members elected of
the Republican faith to vote for Mr.
Grant when they would not otherwise
have done so. - , 1 "vyC
This . being the case, if the . donor of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
money is guilty of a corrupt practice.
some of the members urge that the
parties accepting the aid in their cam
paign are equally guilty.
If the committee proposes to score
Grant and Green it cannot avoid ad
ministering to Wright, who accepted
Grant's money, a like rebuke.
This is the way four members of the
committee look at It. Mr. Mellick, who
went on the committee with the under
standing that he would go to the very
bottom of the whole affair â  to secure
facts, seems to be extraordinarily de
sirous of putting in a wishy-washy re
port. But Mr. Mellick and two other
members of the committee stand â¢ alone
on the proposition. "â¢â '.':'*
.If the report is made to-morrow af
ternoon it will merely be a preliminary
one.. Chairman Cosper this evening re
ceived information which led - him to
believe that it would be unwise to ter
minate the committee's labors at this
Juncture.â* ;â¢--/;. â  â '... â¢ -
Mr. Cosper, so it has. been Intimated
in the official testimony, sent Charles
Lamberson of Visalia to Mr. .Green to
make the statement that he had been
offered $6000 ,by the Burns contingent
to vote for the colonel for United
States Senator, and if he voted for
Grant he thought he was entitled to
like consideration*, ',;.'._
The subpena for. Mr. Lamberson was
originally issued last Thursday, but for
some reason it was not sent out. Final
ly it was served upon him after un
explained delays, and he to-day sent a
telegram to the committee stating that
he would be here Friday.
This placed Mr. Cosper in a rather
delicate position.
If he closed up the report of the com
mittee without taking Lamberson*9
testimony to disprove the $6000 story
he would be placed in the hole. So the
committee will take Lamberson 's testi
mony on Friday. Mr. Cosper stated
this evening that an endeavor would be
made to get a deposition from Milton J.
Green, who, in the presence of . .wit
nesses, has stated that he will tell the
facts of the case, which are in sub
stance that he had the interview with
Lamberson, who told him that Cosper
had, in conversation with him (Lam
berson), stated that he had received a
$6000 offer to vote for Burns, but he
did hot believe he could do so. but if
he voted for Grant he thought that he
should be similarly treated. Mr. Green
states that he told Lamberson he was
not bribing legislators to vote for
Grant, and the interview ended.
The man who took Mr. Lamberson to
Mr. Green was Thomas Nossler â at
least Mr. Nossler stated to a Call re
porter that he did. Mr. Cosper claims
that he is very desirous of securing the
testimony of Nossler, Green and Lam
berson on these points before the in-,
vestigation closes. He can obtain it If
he is very anxious to do so.2
INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
NO INDICATION OF
A BREAK IN ANY
SENATORIAL CAMP
Dictation of Burns' Managers Is
Resented by Legislators. _
Covert Threats of the Man From Mexico and Bis
Touts Now Known to Have No Foundation .
on Ability to Wreak Injury.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 25.â The joint Assembly
of. .th-- Legislature convened to-day.
approved the record of yesterday's ses
sion, took one ballot for United States
Senator and adjourned until to-mor
row noon. The time .occupied in the
proceedings did not exceed nineteen
minutes. The vote taken was. the thir
tieth or the twenty-ninth joint ballot.
Not the slightest resistance was of
fered to the demand for adjournment.
Grant, Burns, Bulla and Barnes have
their forces well in hand. There is not
the slightest premonition of a break in
any camp.
The Arm stand taken by the forces of
Barnes, Bulla and Grant against all
overture? for a caucus renders it ex-,
tremety doubtful if anything can be ac-'
complished t in the way of electing a
Senator while -Burns remains in the
field. His managers issued the procla
mation that there would be no Senator
elected this session if Burns were not
chosen. Supporters of other candidates
did not fancy that kind of dictation,
and consequently resented it.
The touts say that the deadlock can
be broken by a caucus. The caucus
suggestion at this time is simply a
proposition to give Burns a chance to
accomplish something in the dark that
he cannot bring about in the open light
of public observation. The touts are
still boasting that Burns will get the
caucus and ultimately win the Senator
ship. They calculate that the patience
of the members of the Legislature will
soon be exhausted.
The majority of the Republican mem
bers of the Legislature, knowing the
record and public career of Colonel
Burns, entertain the profound convic
tion that no election would be much
better for the people of the State in
general and the Republicans in par
ticular than the election of Burns. They
have been so advised by their con
stituents at home.
The early predictions by the touts
that the patronage of the State admin
istration would be distributed to the
supporters of Dan Burns have not been
verified. The coven threat that mem
bers of the Legislature who shall fail to
line up for the "colonel" could pass no
bills was empty talk.' The manner in
which the Assembly to-day upset the
Burns programme to seat Leon Jones
has opened the eyes of members to the
fact that the organization is not infal
lible or Irresistible. The members of
the Legislature who are voting for
Burns will not get State patronage on
that account. They will not get any
advantage in speedy action on their
bills. The only thing that they are sure
to get is public execration, and
they will get such a dose of that from
the people that it will be many years
before any of them will be regarded
as a fit candidate for public office.
They argue now that the memory of
the people is short and all this will be
forgotten before the next election, but
the public memory can be refreshed
when the season for refreshment ar
rives.
Daily messages and reports are com
ing to Sacramento that the Senator
and Assemblymen who are elected to
represent the people of Siskiyou Coun
ty are deliberately and knowingly mis
representing their constituents. The
people of that county do not want
Burns for United States Senator. They
do desire that Laird and Jilson should
get into a clean Senatorial camp and
stay there to the finish.
Assemblyman Le Barron is not fairly
representing the people of his district
in Sonoma County. There is an im
pression here and at his own home that
he is voting for Grant to please ex-As
semblyman Price, who wants to please
Senator Perkins. Intelligence comes to
Sacramento that the tide of indignation
against Le Barron. in Sonoma County is
beginning to run with a deal of force.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.â One more vote
and no more change. The joint ballot has become part and parcel of
the daily routine and monotony: interest Is dead; the roll call Is
answered in a perfunctory way between paragraph- in the morning
papers, and the outcome of the daily vote is accepted as a foregone con
clusion. . ' .; .-;:";.;;; .
The Investigation committee announces to-night it will submit its
report to the Assembly on Friday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock, and there is
a good deal of - speculation upon what is to follow.
There was the report that the Grant forces would stampede as soon
as the strain was relieved, but after the caucus yesterday that pipe

WARM DEBATE OVER
CONTESTED ELECTIONS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 25.â Assembly opened

In the Assembly.
The report of the minority recommended
that Mr. Leon Jones, the contestant, be
seated. The minority was composed of
Assemblyman Cosper of Fresno, chairman
of the committee.
After a warm wrangle and a cold-blood
ed attempt by Cosper to bury the matter
in the Judiciary Committee, the major
ity report prevailed, and it was upon good
Republican votes that Warden was re
tained in his seat.
Cosper talked copiously in favor of his
single-barreled report, but he was opposed
warmly by Hanley (D.), San Francisco.
Cowan (D.) of Santa Rosa, â¢ Pierce (R.)
of Yolo and Wade (R.) of Napa, and when
the matter came to a vote it was all War
dell's way. â¢ â¢ i
In the afternoon Milton Jay Green did
not appear again when his name was
called at half-past 2. Mr. Green still suf
fers from chill, but Dr. Hatch, who sent
in the necessary certificate, gave out the
glad news that his patient would be "on
his feet in. a "reasonable time." Johnson
of Sacramento thought that forty-eight
hours would be a reasonable time, and
moved that Green's case be set for Friday
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
In the afternoon there was scarcely
enough legislators on hand to do business.

DAN COLE REBUKED
FOR GIVING UP TOO MUCH
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 25.â Ever since Dan Cole
was on the stand before the investiga
tion committee | the Good Government
Club has been contemplating the proper
method of rebuking him, and to-night his
fate was fixed. Dan was expelled from
the club. He Is an outcast, an exile,
accused of a degree of honesty. As Mar
tin Kelly expressed It confidentially to
the bartender of the Golden Eagle, "Dan
wasn't onto himself, and so we put him
on. See?" r,""^-.
An astute reporter was detailed to look
up the proceedings of the club, and
though the members were reticent, as is
the habit of trained diplomacy, he ascer
tained all the essential facts. The club
met in a back room, from which the por
ter had swept the tobacco smoke. Sam
Rainey was In the chair and Kelly acted
as secretary. A roll call showed a quorum
present, consisting of Rainey and Kelly,
the Banjo-Eyed Kid having been shutout
because he had forgotten the pass word
"Boodle." ,
' "Mr. Chairman," , said Kelly, "it be
comes our painful uuty at this moment
to point the linger of. scorn at our one
time friend, Dan Cole. Fain would I
shrink from wounding the soul of our
associate, but when a man gives him
self the worst of It our sense of patriot
ism Is outraged and our blood boils within
our veins, so it does. I understand. Mr.
President, that old Dan Cole had $500 of
good Grant money, and that he threw it
at the birds, or, rather, at one bird, for
that's Jilson. What would you think of
a man who would deliberately take such
a respectable sum, and in the dividing
of the same give the Other guys the
best of it to the tune of 4to 1? I would
call him a chump." â¢ - ..-â ,-â .
"Hear! hear!" shouted the chairman,
and then hastily calling himself to order
imposed a fine of two steams, for which
he has not settled, i.v- â¢<â¢,/â¢:-,â¢> Â - â¢â¢â *.â â 
"In- view of the emergency," continued
Kelly, "and- the absolute necessity that
the Good Government Club ain't made no
monkey of, I have prepared and now pre
sent the following:
Whereas, The Good Government Club has
â  heard with regret and 'shame that Ole Dan
Cole had $500, and let go of It; and
Whereas, This club, organized for the pro
motion of purity, and unable to promote with
out dough, didn't get a bean; and -f
Whereas, Dan gave Jllson $400 to blow, the
which Jilson blew, thereafter voting" for the
other fellow, thus proving himself a Judas, a
Benedict Arnold, and a mighty poor article for
such an ancient stager as the Dan aforesaid to
be buying, "- since Dan ain't no novice; and
Whereas, Dan only kept $100 himself and
didn't keep that long; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the said Daniel is a hopeless
jay. and that his statesmanship Is nit; and
be it
Resolved, That he ought to be and Is hereby
fired, bounced, projected from the precincts of
the club, and that while at a bar, when he has
the price, we may recognize him briefly, he
ain't one of us no more, and don't you forget
it; and be it
Resolved, That any member of this club who
gets hold of $500 and lets go of more than $100
when there has to be a division, is lacking in
those high moral qualities which constitute the
distinguishing feature of this body.
"Mr. Chairman," said Kelly, "I would
like to speak to the resolution."
"You'll speak to me if you talk at all,"
responded the chairman with becoming
dignity, "but there's no use of talking.
Dan's dead as Wright, and we want no
corpses a contaminating of the atmos
phere. Are ye ready for the question?
Them as favors it say 'aye.' Them as
is agin it, don't say a word or I'll break
the face of ye. The 'ayes' have It. * Let
the drinks be ordered, and the resoluÂ»
tions spread upon the records. Adjourn

A MEASURE AGAINST
THE POLITICAL PUSH
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 25.â Senator Stratton has
what might be termed a "long scent" in
tho matter of introducing bills covering
the matter of purity of primary elec
tions. This morning he took another turn
at the subject by presenting a bill making
it a felony for anybody to act as an elec
tion officer at a primary election who has
not been duly appointed to act. Any per
son who willfully fails to perform his
duty as an election officer at a primary is
to be punished by a fine not exceeding
$1000 or by imprisonment in the peniten
tiary for not over five years, or both.
Any person failing to answer questions
asked by judges as to his qualifications to
vote at a primary is guilty of a misde
meanor^
Any person who votes illegally or who
votes twice, or who attempts to or does
change a vote after it has been cast, is
guilty of felony. -.â -,-
Anybody who aids, abets or advises a
man to cast a fraudulent vote at a pri
mary Is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Any election, officer' at a primary who
attempts to or does destroy the poll list;
to add additional names to it; to place. in
the ballot box before or after the voting
commences or ends, or attempts or does
illegally attempt to change the result by
fraud or permits another to do so, is
guilty of a felony, punishable by not less
than two nor more than seven years in
the penitentiary. . .
Any officer of a primary who exposes a
ballot after It has been folded and offered
to be voted is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Any officer making a fraudulent return
of a primary election Is guilty of a felony,
and is to have not less than two nor more
than ten years in the penitentiary.
Any officer who aids or abets in the
commission of any offence In connection
with the holding of a primary election Is
to suffer an imprisonment of not less than
six months in the County Jail nor more
than two years in the penitentiary.
Any attempt at coercion or Intimida
tion or corruption of a voter at a primary
is made a felony.
Any person who, for the purpose of pro
moting the election of himself or any
other person as delegate at a primary
election furnishes entertainment for elec
tors, agrees to or does pay money or
property to get voters to the polls, save
the expense of holding public meetings,
printing ballots and other paper, is guilty
of a misdemeanor.
s No person competent as a witness is to
be excused from testifying as to the com
mission of any of the offenses named in
this act.
Senator Stratton's bill certainly destroys
the efficiency of the "push" at primary
elections, and if it becomes a law the po
litical hanger-on will be a thing of the
past.

highly probable in view of present con

POLICY OF EVASION
Representative Johnson of In
dicia Maizes a Sensatiooal
Speech 013 Expansion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.â since
the stirring days before the declaration
of war last spring has the House wit
nessed such an exhibition of excitement
and such scenes of unbounded enthusi
asm as occurred to-day when two Re
publicans, Johnson, the Indiana mem
ber, and Dolliver of lowa, locked horns
on the question of expansion. The army
bill, which was under debate, was
swallowed tip in the broader question
of our future national policy and the
. debate was lifted from the deal level
of mediocrity into absolute brilliancy.
Johnson secured time from the Demo
cratic side to attack the position of the
administration. It was not the first
time he has broken away from his
party on public questions. On past oc
casions he has won a reputation as a
master of invective and the knowledge
that he was to speak attracted an enor
mous crowd to the galleries. To-day
he added to his reputation. With sa
tire, irony and wit, the keen thrusts of
his logic were driven home. His words
flowed in a perfect torrent. He de
nounced the proposition to annex the
' Philippines as subversive of every tra
dition dear to the American heart in
the past and the inauguration of a
policy that would end in the downfall
of the republic. He said the ratifica
tion of the treaty by the Senate would
found the death knell of all the efforts
of those who were trying to prevent
the country from rushing on to suicide
and declared If he were a Senator he
would rot in his seat before it should
be ratified. He denounced the Presl- i
. dent as the slavish follower of public
opinion, but warned- him that the tide
would recede and the voice of the peo- |
ple would in time rebuke. Members j
stood in the aisles ten deep while he j
was speaking, but he tried to stop the '
TREATY OF PEACE IS
SOON TO BE RATIFIED
NEW YORK, Tan. 25. â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends the follow
ing: Ratification of the peace treaty on or before February 6. Probable adoption of a, reso
lution declaring that the peace treaty does not bind the United States to permanent . control
of the Philippines. Appropriation of $20,000,000 to carry out the provisions of the treaty.
Passage of some compromise measure for providing enough men to garrison the colonies.
Xo extra session of Congress. "
This is now the outlook as the result of the action of the Senate to-day in agreeing to
take a vote on the peace treaty and pending amendments at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on
February 6, if not earlier. It was the most important action of the present session. Uncer
tainty and doubt have been dissipated, and the Senate can set about the transaction of busi-
ness.
Leading Senators who have made a careful canvass of the situation have no doubt as
to the ratification of the treaty Senator Davis says he has not attempted to poll the Senate,
but he has no doubt considerable more than sixty Senators will vote for the treaty when ac
tion is finally taken.
applause which continually broke out
from the Democratic side. For almost
two hours his words poured forth.
. When he had finished Dolliver came
to the defense of the administration.
One of the ablest debaters and perhaps
the most eloquent member of the
House, his reply set the Republicans
wild with enthusiasm. He described
how the President had been fairly driv
en into war by those who now sought
. to embarrass him before peace was
definitely obtained, and his eulogy of !
the President, patiently meeting all the ;
perplexing problems which beset iiiin j
i as the groat events of the year moved j
l on, aroused his side and the galleries)
to cheers. These rang out again and
again as he paid an eloquent tribute
to Admiral Dewey, and broke out in re
â¢ r.ewed volume when he declared that
the course of some members at both
. ends of the Capitol was "almost trea
sonable." But the highest pitch of ex
citement was reached when Johnson
and Dolliver got to close quarters
. toward the end of the latter's speech.
â¢ Johnson pressed the defender of the
administration to disclose the Presi
dent's ultimate purpose regarding the
Philippines, but Dolliver for some time
- adroitly evaded a direct response. At
last he contented himself with declar
ing that this was not the point at i*
j;ue; that the first thing was to end the
war by ratifying the treaty. The fu
ture of the Philippines was a question
for the future. It was in every respect
a remarkable debate.
Gibson (R.) of Tennessee was the first
speaker. He advocated the passage of
. the Hull bill. In the course of his re
marks he argued that it was too soon for
â  us to decide upon a permanent policy re
garding the Philippines. Our present pol
- â¢ lev should be delay until we had thor
oughly investigated the situation.
-â¢' Johnson (R.) of Indiana then took the
. 'floor in opposition to the bill. As he arose
.the Democrats applauded and squared
themselves around in anticipation of some
sensational utterances.
"While the President, In. the presence of
what he may conceive to be a' popular de
. mand," he began. "is hurrying the army
and navy across the seas to inflict upon
alien people a government against their
will. I propose Fearlessly, without regard
to its effect upon my personal fortunes.
to make a plea for liberty and an argu
. ment against the perpetuation of lnjus
. tire.
"We are on the verge of a crisis," said
.Johnson. "Those who failed to rush for
" ward in support of the schemes of the im
'. -perialists are being denounced here and in
the public press as 'Spaniards,* and men
: who fall to do their duty. My answer in
â¢to that that if the chief executive will
. -break his sijence and openly state that we
do not propose to enslave the people of
: the Philippines, my word for it, the pres
ent strained relations fh the islands will
â ' cease, those who were but yesterday our
â¢ allies will return to their homes, and
':. there will be no necessity for this pro
â¢â¢' posed increase In the standing army."
But this would not be done, the speaker 'â 
added. What meant this hasty disavowal
of Senator Foraker's statement that the
administration had no intention of hold
ing the Islands permanently? If the ad
ministration did not mean to hold the
Philippines, what meant this clamor of i
the administration press? Why had the <
President's Commissioners demanded the j
absolute cession of the islands instead of |
simply demanding their evacuation, as
was done in the case of Cuba? Why did
not Senator Davis, who was in charge of
the treaty in the Senate, agree to allow
the passage of a resolution disavowing
the Government's purpose to hold the
Islands permanently? These were patent
facts, which could not be dodged. They
must be faced squarely. Everything
pointed in one directionâ the purpose to
annex the Philippine Islands.
Continuing, the speaker drew a parallel
between our revolutionary struggle and
the struggle of the Filipinos for indepen
dence. He argued that to-day they had
a stable government, republican in form;
a President, a Vice President and a Con
gress, the whole founded upon the free
consent of the governed.
To attempt to subvert that Government,
he charged, would be an "unspeakable
crime," that should bring the blush of
shame to the cheek of every freeborn
American. They had not waged war for
a change of masters. They had rejected
with scorn the high-sounding manifestos
of the President of the United States.
They preferred to be free and they now
stood with arms ln their hands,.undaunt
ed, standing against the United States for
independence and liberty, .as they had
stood against Spain.
A people with such stamina were
worthy of their freedom. Could It be
"criminal aggression" to annex Cuba and
not "criminal aggression" to annex the
Philippines? It was true, the natives
were alien in race, language and habits
of thought, and, therefore, the whole
scheme was to hold them as Spain had
held her colonies in times past, as Eng
land holds hers now, ruled over by mili
tary satraps. They might not be as ca
pable as we for self-government, said
Johnson, with biting sarcasm. -They
might not be able to corrupt legislators
In order to hold dishonored seats in the
Senate, as we were. -They might not be
able to decide contested - election cases
according to the party considerations in
stead of their merits, as we were. They
might not be able to practice fraud in
elections. They might be lacking in all
these essential attributes of republican
ism, but they were capable of constitut
ing a government according to their own
ideas. All governments were progressive
and in time they would rise on their dead
selves to higher things.
"I pride myself, Mr. Speaker." he con
tinued, drawing himself up to his full
height, "that I have broadened since I
entered public life. My party Is a means, |
not an end, with me, and when I believe |
my party Is wrong nothing can make me
abate my independent convictions."
(Great Democratic applause.)
Proceeding, he denounced the Presi
dent's course as a "policy of evasion,"
and charged that his supporters were
conjuring up specters to drive in the op
position. It was declared that our fail
ure to take the Philippines would pre
cipitate a general European war; that all
the nations of Europe would scramble for
what we left if we withdrew. He said he
had seen no such disposition except on
the part of Germany, and she was actu
ated by the example of our greed. If we
set the example and withdrew, recogniz
ing the Independence of the Filipinos, oth
ers would do likewise. But if other coun- I
tries did pounce down upon the islands,
let them do it. We would not expressedly |
or impliedly be responsible. If they did \
they would be but pursuing their tradi- j
tions. Let us see that we do no wrong, j
The evil was theirs. If there was. he
said, to be a European war, let us, in !
God's name, keep out of it. The cry j
went up. "Ratify the treaty and stop the I
war." The President arrogated to him- !
self the right to speak for ,70,000,000 peo- j
ple.
"I thank God," shouted Johnson, "for
the spirit of independence in the Senate
of the United States, irrespective of ;
party. Bryan . never made a greater |
blunder than when he said the treaty |
should be ratified and our policy deter
mined afterward. Andrew Carnegie was |
nearer right, but he said the treaty i
should be fought in the dark, not in the
open. I say we should fight it from start
to finish. We should meet this whole ;
question at the threshold and strangle it ;
to death. Public sentiment should be !
aroused. It Is being aroused, as cvi- 1
denced by the great public meetings in .
New York and Philadelphia, and take my
word for It, it will not be many months
before the tide of public sentiment which
the President vainly imagines Is now
carrying him to a second term will recede
and leave him high and dry. The voice
of the people will rebuke the spirit of i
commerce which has supplanted the spirit
Of liberty. If the treaty is ratified with- j
out being coupled with a resolution de- !
claring for the ultimate independence of
the islands it will be the deathknell of all
our efforts to stop the torrent." .
He would vote for a bill to reorganize \
the army, but before God he would never ,
vote for a standing army of 100,000, whose |
ultimate object was to establish a colo- \
nial system. "If I were in the- Senate," I
he said, "I would rot in mv seat first; I I
would scorn the demands or a State Leg- i
islature and the clamor of the press. I j
would let them malign my character and ;
misinterpret my motives, but I would
never swerve from what I believed to be I
right."
Johnson next referred to the part Great
Britain had taken- In inducing the United
States to enter Into controversies of the
far East and of the manner in which
British assistance was being given to the
"Iniquitous policy of William McKln- j
ley." - . . . Â -
"Let there be a new treaty," he pleaded
vehemently: "let it not give $20,000,000 for !
a cession of the Philippines to the United !
States, but let it . provide unequivocally '
that Spain withdraw from the Philip- ;
pines and give the Philippines the Inesti- >
mable blessings of liberty.' This world ]
policy meant the: embarking of a course !
like that of England, which embroiled it j
In war uninterruptedly for 100 years."
The Indiana member now turned to the !
cost of expansion. .He detailed the cost '
of the war and the estimates of $143,000,- :
000 â  for- the military establishment and ;
$47,000,000 for the naval establishment for !
the next fiscal year. It showed, he said, I
THE SAN FRANCISCO: CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1899.
SHERMAN OPPOSES
PHILIPPINE INVASION
NEW . TORK, Jan. 25.â The
Evening World to-day prints an
interview with John Sherman, in
which the latter forcibly ex
presses himself against expan
sion. The ex-Secretary of State
is quoted as saying, in part:
"I am decidedly opposed to the
invasion of the Philippines. The
Idea of our country forcing its
way into these islands and forc
ing its government upon the
7,000,000 or 9,000,000 population is
monstrous. It is subversive of
the basic principle of our Gov
ernment that the just powers of
government are derived from the
consent of the governed, and it is
violation of the traditions of our
country."
"Then, if you were in the Sen
ate, you would not vote to rat-
r ify the treaty of Paris as it
stands?" â ,'â¢>';.':.: *'-->
"If . I -were in the Senate" I
would not vote to ratify as it
stands. I would vote to with
draw from the islands as soon as
possible. The papers say that
4000 soldiers have just been sent
to Manila. Why were they sent?
Are we going to war against a
struggling republic? They have
been fighting for many years
against Spain and have practi
cally driven Spain out. Are we
to take the place of Spain in ty
rannizing over these struggling
people?"
that our war budget exceeded that of th<
great military powers of the world, I
was within three millions of the cost 01
Great Britain's vast establishment, bj
which she ruled her colonial empire; ii
was more than the war budget of Ger
many; more than that of France or oi
any other nation on the face of the globe
And this was to realize "the wild drean
of expansion." , .
Johnson's time was twice extended
Democratic members of the Milltar>
Committee yielding their time to him
The Monroe doctrine, he declared, woulc
vanish with the annexation of the Phil
ippines. If we reached out into anothei
hemisphere we could not with propriety
resist aggression in this. Johnson said
that the cup of our national humiliation
was filled to overflowing, and in closing
said
"We have witnessed the splendid
achievements of our soldiers and sailors
and have Inspired In the Old World a
feeling of respect. This country, the
beacon light of liberty, this locked and
Intrenched continent, this proud and
erect nation, which never In its history
was obliged to ask a favor of any other
country on earth, now depends upon the
intervention of England to keep other
powers off Its back. We have become a
miserable mendicant, dependent upon the
mother country. We are compelled to
abandon th" cardinal principal of protec
tion and submit to tne 'open door'
policyâ"
, At this point the gavel fell, and John
son said he would not trespass further
upon the time of the other side, though
he was urged to go on.
"I thank the other side," he said, "for
the opportunity to be heard, which I could
not obtain from this side."
There was a whirlwind of applause
when Johnson took his seat, and many
Democrats crowded up the aisle to con
gratulate him. -.-:;;. r.-v.v.
When Dolliver .of lowa rose to reply
there was an outburst of applause from
the Republican side. Almost every seat
on the floor by this time was occupied
and the galleries were packed to the
doors. He began by saying that he had
had no intention of making an elaborate
speech on this bill and he resented John
son's statement that he had been ma
neuvering for an opportunity to reply
He had never heard the epithet "Span
lard" applied to the gentleman from In
diana or any other member on the floor
and if the gentleman deserved the title
he must get it from some other tongue
than his.
"I am not here to speak for . the. ad
ministration," he continued. "I belong to
the humble ranks of my party, and have
not been' ln the "White House since the
war with Spain began. But I might re
sent % statement that our President, so
accessible, is 'intrenched' in the White
House. He Is intrenched in the White
House in the higher and better sense, and
as surely as the gentleman from Indiana
Is Intrenched In private life (laughter),
brought there, as I believe, by his attacks
and criticisms of the Republican party."
- He would not make an extended reply,
he said, but he did desire to say some
thing of the large responsibilities "which
had come vto us as a result of the war.
He had hoped that Congress would ap
proach this question ln the larger, broader
spirit ln which the war had been entered
upon. The war, had brought all sections
and parties together in a common cause.
Now that It was over and the treaty
signed and ready for ratification It would
seem that the same spirit should be pre
served. But, on the contrary, ; the Con
gressional Record and the magazines were
filled with views more numerous . and
varied than the Islands we had captured
from the enemy. It had been so ln the
war of 1812. A faction had sought to em
barrass the Government. In the Mexican
War .our armies never got beyond the
reach of those who criticized the conduct
of the war, and during. the Civil, War a
restless and Insistent minority in both
houses never ceased its hostility. In the
Spanish war. for the first time in our his
tory, what was done was done -In the
spirit of a common people, ln the spirit of
lofty and national life. In â  his humble
Judgment, the greatest May . In our

DEMANDS AN ACCOUNTING
LOS ANGELES STREET RAILWAY
STOCK INVOLVED.
It Is Claimed the Scheming Manipu
lator Converted Thousands of-
Shares to His Own
Use. , '
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25.â The out
come of the recent agitation regarding
the wrecking of the Pacific Bank of
San Francisco will be a lawsuit be
tween the bank as plaintiff and Moses
H. Sherman of this city as defendant.
A complaint has been filed in the Su
perior Court of . this . county in which
the bank asks for an accounting of 25,
--500 shares of stock in the Los Angeles
Consolidated Railway.
The complaint alleges that in 1889
the bank and Sherman were equal own
ers of the stock In question, which was
of a par value of $2,550,000, and consti
tuted 51 per cent of the capital stock
of the corporation. That plaintiff and
defendant. might retain control of the
company's affairs, it was agreed to
place the stock in the hands of B. O.
Carr, Sherman's brother-in-law, to be
voted by him in the interest of the
owners for a period of ten years. ..
The complaint continues that, in No
vember, 1892, ; Sherman represented to
the bank that the road was in financial
distress, notwithstanding that $300,000
had been spent prior to that time for
improvements. Sherman, it is claimed,
represented that $150,000 could be bor
rowed from a person whom he did not
name. .' That person was to hold the
25,500 shares \ of - stock as i security ; for
the : loan. This waa agreed to. y
The bank now alleges that this trans
action waa not undertaken by Sher
man In good Yalth, but In order to gain
personal control of the stock, which
was in 1894 exchanged, by Sherman for
other stock and bonds worth $500,000.
The bank now claims half of this sum
on the ground that Sherman holds it as
trustee. . Representatives, of the bank
regard, this sum as the proceeds of the
half : interest of the original block of
stock. Judgment for $275,000 Is asked
for. :2 . r. â â â â .:- â " â â¢â 
GEORGE M. BECKETT
DIES AT STANFORD
Varsity Baseball Captain Succumbs
to the Effects of an
. r Operation. .
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan, 25.â
George M.'- Beckett, '00, ; Varsity Â» baseball
captain, died this morning at 3 o'clock
in his room at Enclna Hall from heart
failure resulting from complications fol
lowing appendicitis. His death came as
a sad blow to his student friends, for it
was thought the young man had passed
the danger point and was on the way to
recovery. The remains were sent to Red
wood City, where they will be embalmed
and then taken to his home in Arroyo
Grande, San Luis Obispo County, to
morrow. The funeral will probably take
place on Friday.
Mr. Beckett was born in Watsonvllle
and was 23 years of age. Since entering
college he has been prominent in ath
letics. He succeeded in making the
Varsity nine as pitcher in his freshman
year. Last year he -again occupied the
box, and at the end of the season was
elected captain. His heart was In his
team, and his work as captain, promised
to be productive of excellent results.
A deep feeling of sadness prevails
throughout the college. Captain Beckett
was well known and deservedly popular
with his fellow-students. Meetings have
been held by the executive committee of
the student body, the junior class and
Enclna Club for the purpose of passing
resolutions and making arrangements for
floral pieces. y

result of an operation for tumor of the
stomach. The primary operation was per
formed last Friday, and an attempt will
be made to drain the tumor to-morrow,
but the surgeons hold out little hope of
Taylor's recovery.

concluded, turned to .General Eagan
and inquired whether he objected to
any of the members of the court as
designated by the order. General Ea
gan replied:
"I do not."
The members of the court then arose
and took the usual oath. The charges
and specifications were then read.
During these preliminary proceedings
General Eagan exhibited no signs of
nervousness, but the. expression of his
face and his manner clearly indicated
that he realized that the trial involved
consequences to him of the gravest
character. While he stood listening to
the charges and specifications his face
seemed somewhat paler than usual, and
at the conclusion of the reading, on be
ing requested to plead to the specifica
tions to the first charge he said, "Not
guilty," not denying, however, that the
specifications set forth . correctly part
of the language used.
To the second charge he pleaded,
"Not guilty." (
The judge advocate then arose and
said that the case in hand was a pecu
liar one. but presented no unusual dif
ficulties. ';'* j"- ; V '
. The accused wished to add to his plea
of not guilty some words tending to
qualify it, but he did not. think the
plea relieved the court from the neces
sity of proving the facts alleged.
Attorney Worthington. responded
briefly, and explained why, the Qualify
ing words had been used upon his rec
ommendation. The specifications did
the accused a great injustice, jin that
they selected particular expressions
without giving the context, and in one
or more instances the specifications
quoted begin in the middle of a sen
tence. Continuing, Mr. Worthington
wild that he desired to state briefly to
the court the substance- of General
lagan's defense; Whatever, he said,
the court might think of the propriety
Of the language used by General Eagan
before the War Investigating Commis
sion, there was no doubt in his (Worth
lngton's) mind that Eagan was fully,
protected in using that language by
the laws of the land. In no court, civil
or military, he said, could the accused
be held accountable for his language,
even if it could be shown that the
speaker was actuated by malice. In
addition to this, the President of the
United States had instructed the War
Investigating Committee to announce
publicly that witnesses before that
tribunal would be given immunity for
whatever they might testify to. This
was a solemn promise given by the
President of the United States, and
counsel had no doubt that the court
would find that General Eagan could
not, under these circumstances, be held
to answer to a military court-martial
for his language. General Miles, he
said, had appeared before the commit
tee about three weeks before General
Eagan had made his statement, and on
that occasion had made most serious
and sweeping charges against many of
his subordinates, ' and particularly
against the commissary department of
the army. He had charged General
Eagan with being incompetent and neg
lectful of his duties and had inferenti-
ally charged him with Issuing poisoned
meat to the soldiers of the army, and
had averred that many had died In con
sequence. He had also implied that
General Eagan went to the Secretary of
War and asked leave to bring charges
against him. General Alger had replied
that under the President's order of im
munity, General Miles could not be
held responsible for his language before
the committee. The newspapers then
took it up and goaded General Eagan
almost to desperation. He had come to
believe that the press and the country
at large had accepted the accusations
made by General Miles as true, and the
condition of his mind, in consequence,
grew worse and worse, until he was in
a state bordering on distraction. The
language which General Eagan used
under these circumstances was the nat
ural outburst of an honest man suf
fering under an unjust accusation.
At 10:25 o'clock word came from the
White House that the President would
receive the members of the court be
tween 11 and 12 o'clock. Thereupon
General Merrltt announced that the
court would take a recess for the pur
pose of paying its respects to the Pres
j ident. '." .
On reassembling at 11:50 time was
j given a photographer in which to take
j a picture of the court, and then Major
I S. C. Mills was called to testify on be
! half of the Government. He said he
i was the recorder of the War Investiga
j tion Commission and was present and
\ heard General Eagan's testimony be
j fore the commission. The manner of
j General Eagan in giving his testimony,
j he said, was that of a man laboring un
; der great excitement, but trying to con
trol himself. The witness had charge
of the typewritten testimony given by
General Eagan and had delivered the
same to General Dodge at hotel.
Subsequently the witness had returned
the paper to General Eagan with a let
ter from the commission declining to
receive it in its present condition.
The witness recalled some of the
words used by General Eagan in his
testimony, which agreed substantially
with the phraseology In the specifica
tions. He was shown a copy , of the
specifications and Identified the lan
guage there quoted â¢as having been
used by General Eagan.
Worthington Interrupted to say that
General Eagan did not "deny* the lan
guage quoted and, had not the orig
inal statement been destroyed after the
objectionable words had been expunged,
he would willingly produce it.
. Major General McCook, retired, a
member of the War Investigation Com
mission, was the next witness. He was
present and had heard a part of Gen
eral Eagan's testimony before the com
mittee. .
"The Impression," he said, "I had was
that General . Eagan must be laboring
under great nervous excitement."
He recalled some of .the language
used, and it agreed substantially with
the testimony as published. He was
shown a copy of the specifications and
identified some of the language as hav
ing been used by General Eagan.
The -words, "I want, to force the lie
j back into his throat, covered with the
contents of a camp latrine," General
I McCook did not hear. He had his own

views as to such language as he had
first heard and he had turned away and
did not hear this sentence. The witness
recalled a remark made by the Presi
dent in regard to the immunity of wit
nesses. r The President had said, in sub
stance, that any person who should
come before the commission to give evi
dence should receive immunity from the
action of'any higher authority. It was
the understanding of the commission
that this immunity , extended only to
legitimate testimony that could be re
ceived by any tribunal. No written
statement or order. as to the immunity
of witnesses, as, far as he knew, had
ever been made.: General Miles had ap
peared before the commission some,
days before General Eagan was heard.
He had objected to being sworn and
his statement had been received with
out his taking the oath. General Miles
was the only witness, so far as he re
called, who had objected to taking tho
oath, although one witness in New
York had refused to swear that he
would tell the whole truth. Other wit
nesses had - preferred to affirm. The
commission had no hard and fast rule
in regard to the matter of the oath.
The judge advocate then read at some
length from General Miles' testimony
before the War Investigating Commis
sion which called forth the objection
able language in General Eagan's state
ment.
, At the conclusion of the reading of
I General Miles' statement Judge Worth

According to the evidence placed In

â  . - . -.-. -i
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUISUN, Jan. 25.â three prisoners
who have been confined in the Solano
County Jail for two weeks, charged
with the murder of old Dan Wilson,
the Sulsun Valley rancher, are once
more breathing the air of freedom.
William J. Miller, Mrs. Elizabeth G.
Dickinson and Mrs. Addie Wilson were
discharged from custody this morning
by Justice of the Peace Hitchcock on
motion of District Attorney Devlin, who
had come to the conclusion after sleep
ing on the testimony given at the pre
liminary examination . yesterday that
the evidence did not warrant holding
the prisoners for trial before the Su
perior Court.
Promptly at 10 o'clock this. morning
the prisoners were brought into court,
where, they were joined by their attor
neys. Judge Hitchcock" was on â¢ the
bench and the courtroom was fairly
well filled, although after the collapse
of the case of the prosecution yester
day it X was generally . understood that
the accused would be . allowed their,
liberty, which served to render the pro-,
ceedings of to-day flat and uninterest-
ing. - : â  . ..; . â  Â â¢
As soon ,as court was convened the
District Attorney . arose and . after re
viewing the evidence in the case moved
that the prisoners be discharged. He
said:
If the court please, I fully appreciate
the responsibility of the Prosecuting At
torney, ln this case, but I think that at
this time it would be wrong to leave the
making of a motion for acquittal to coun
sel for the defense. The testimony has
been carefully weighed and considered by
me, and in justice to my office of District
Attorney, in justice to the people and- In
Justice to these defendants, It seems to
be my clear duty to move that the de
fendants be not held. It Is with respect
for my office and with the view of right
and justice that I will make my motion.
Whatever my private opinion is, and
whatever the opinions of others may be,
action in this case must be 'based on the
legal evidence. Every bit of testimony
that I know anything about has been
brought into this case. Everything pos
sible has been done to secure a convic
tion. In relation to defendant Miller we
had a positive Identification of him by
Witness Riley as a man who hired a rig
at Vallejo on the night of the murder.
Against that stands the alibi which Is
supported by the testimony of Mrs. Shee
han and her two daughters. What value
that alibi would have would be for a jury
to determine. I am satisfied In my own
Judgment, however, that the evidence is
not sufficient to secure a conviction be
fore a jury of twelve men. We could not
submit the evidence to one unbiased man
and expect him to say that Miller -should
die on the gallows. The evidence that a
man hired a buggy twenty-five miles
from the scene of the murder Is not suf
ficient, and even that is met with oppos
ing proofs. I am not. Justified in putting
the county to the expense of a long drawn
out murder trial on the testimony that we
have obtained, and so it is my duty to
move that you dismiss the defendants.
As the District Attorney resumed his
seat the Judge said:
I have weighed the testimony very thor
oughly and I fully concur in what the
District Attorney has said. Therefore the
defendants are acquitted.
Mrs. Miller, who was in the court
room, rushed over to where her hus
band was sitting, and gave him a
hearty kiss, but aside from this soli
tary incident there was no demonstra
tion. The three prisoners had been
assured by their attorneys that they
were bound to be set free, and they
were prepared for the announcement
when they appeared in court. They
were taken back to the jail, where they
quickly gathered up their belongings,
and sought the sunshine. Mrs. Dick
inson sought to thank the District At
torney for his action in moving for a
dismissal, but Mr. Devlin declined to
take any credit to himself. He assured
Mrs. Dickinson that If there had been
any evidence brought forward to. con
nect her with the murder he would
have insisted that she be held for trial.
That such evidence was lacking was
her good fortune, and not due to any
inclination on his part to be "lenient
with her.
Hez McEwen met his housekeeper at
the gate leading to the courthouse,
and Mrs. Dickinson at once began lay
ing down the law to him. W. H. Mor
rison, McEwen's brother-in-law. had a
talk with Hez before the prisoners were
discharged this morning, and advised
him not to take Mrs. Dickinson back to
the ranch. Morrison declared that if
McEwen did not heed his advice he
(Morrison) would have nothing more
to do with him. It is more than likely,
however, that both Mrs. Dickinson and
Mrs. Wilson will return to the ranch to
live. Miller and his wife returned to
their home in Port Costa this after
noon. ________________
SHOOTING AFFRAY
ON A YOLO RANCH
Wounded" Japanese Declares His As-
sailant Was a Midnight
Marauder.
WOODLAND, Jan. 25.â A shooting af
fray occurred on the Hershey farm, near
Blacks, last night, and some rather pe
culiar â¢ circumstances are connected with
the case. A Japanese known as Kishmoto
was seriously wounded, and, according to I
the story told by his countrymen, the
bullet was fired from the pistol of a rob
ber. Ten Japanese, under the charge of j
a boss named K. Hazaino, are living on !
the place, engaged In pruning the or- j
chard. They are quartered in a house j
about a quarter of a mile from the house j
where Mr. Howard and several white men
stay.
According to the story of a Japanese, a
tall man came to their quarters at about
midnight. They were all asleep except
a Japanese named Kishmoto, who hap
pened to be outside of the building at
that time, y, â¢
The unknown prowler proceeded to ran
sack the belongings of the Japanese, and
succeeded in obtaining about $100 from
the inmates of the house, who were too
badly frightened to make any resistance.
â¢ Just as the robber was about to leave
the house Kishmoto, who had been out ;
in the orchard, entered the building and ,
the robber shot him. Great : excitement i
followed, and * the robber I succeeded In I
making his escape with the booty.
The Japanese say that the robber was I
a tall man and had a scar under the left !
eye. He disappeared in a southerly di- j
rection from the place where the shoot
ing occurred. . :.â '/â "-â â  â¢".->â .--
While there is nothing glaringly defec- I
tive- about the Japs' r story, there is
considerable doubt expressed about the '
alleged robbery. Some - think that the
men quarreled among themselves, during
which Kishmoto was shot, : and that the
robbery story was conococted to j shield
the guilty party. i

COLWELL IN GALLERY ROLE

* IN TWO.
Marin County's Youthful Highway
men Sends for Sheriff Taylor
and Surrenders Several n'^
Smuggled Tools.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. Victor J.
Colwell, the youthful bandit, who held
up the stage running between this city
and Bolinas last September, came with
in an ace of regaining his liberty and
taking French leave of this community
a few nights ago. Saws for cutting
steel were smuggled in to him by con
federates, and when he ceased work he
had four bars of the window in his cell
nearly sawed through. A few hours'
work was all that s.tood between him
and freedom, but, strange to say. a
debt of gratitude he owed to Will P.
Taylor, the new Sheriff, so preyed upon
his mind that at the last moment he re
vealed the fact of his Intended Jail
break, - handed over his tools to the
officers of the law. â¢ 7
On the 19th of last September Colwell
donned a mask and held up the Bolinas
stage near Liberty station. The driver
and six passengers were forced to yield
up their possessions, including several
gold watches and $65 in cash. He- was
overtaken on the Greenbrae road two
hours v later by Sheriff Harrison . and
posse, and all the plunder was found
in his possession. He acknowledged his
guilt and said that if it had been any
body but Harrison he would have
fought to the death. The affair creat
ed a tremendous sensation on account
of Colwell 's youth and the high regard
felt throughout the community for his
family. ...."-
In the latter part of December, a few
days before Sheriff Harrison resigned
his office to Taylor, saws were smug
gled into Colwell and he managed to
cut two bars of his cell window almost
through before the change came' in the
shrievalty. Since then he has man
aged to sever two more.
A few ; days ago he sent for Sheriff
Taylor and" without a word took that
official to the window and showed him
the work. Then he went- to -his bunk
and produced the saws with which it
had been done. In reply to the aston
ished Sheriff's inquiry as to why he
had not gone on and made his escape,
Colwell replied:
"Will, you did me a good turn once
and I haven't forgotten It. The tempta
tion was great, but I reflected that if I
got away at the beginning of your term
it would hurt you in the eyes of the
public. If Harrison had lasted two
days longer nobody around here would
ever have heard of me again."
He was placed in another cell and
the number- of those admitted to see
him appreciably reduced.; Many believe
Colwell thought he could never get out
of the country and acquainted Taylor
of his intended escape as a kind of
"grand stand play," which he thought
would cause Taylor to make a j plea
for a light sentence from Judge An
gellotti. They base their opinion on the
fact that Colwell tried . this game on
Ex-Sheriff Harrison when he was ar
rested by saying that he would have
killed anybody else that had tried to
arrest him. Despite this evidence of
friendship, he admits he would have
made his escape If Harrison had "last
ed two days longer."
The youthful highwayman's case
comes up in court on the 30th Inst. It
is said he intended to change his plea
to guilty, but Attorney J. W. Cochrane
asserts that his client will now stand
trial. ;;-

the murder of Alfred Cook, will be held
to-morrow morning in the rooms of the
Superior Court instead of Justice Brad

In the opinion of District Attorney Bell
Walters' hearing will not take more than

McKenzie's examination probably will

CHARLESTON, W. Va., Jan. 25.â
Scott was elected United States Sena
tor to-day in the joint Assembly. He
received 48 votes, McGraw 46 and Goff
1. Necessary to elect, 48. One seat in
the Senate and one in the House were
vacant. Thomas voted first for Bliz
zard and afterward changed his vote
to. Scott. The announcement was re
ceived with the wildest applause.
Both Senate and House to-day .ac
cepted the resolution suspending action
in all fairly contested cases until Feb
ruary 7, and suspending Senator Baker
in the meantime. This is the result of
an agreement between the two parties
and leaves the Republicans a majority
of three on joint ballot.
; Nathan Bay Scott was born in Guern
sey County,: Ohio, in 1842. He enlisted
in the Union * army and was mustered
out in 1865; -settled in Wheeling, and
shortly afterward- he went to work as
an employe of the Central Glass Com
pany. '. In a j short time he was em
ployed as manager and soon afterward
was elected president of the comoanv.
which position he filled for years. He
served . two years as president of the
second - branch of the City Council of
Wheeling. He was elected, in 1882. as
a member of â â¢. the State Senate, and
again' in 1888, serving eight years. In
the last race he defeated Hon. John O.
Pendleton in a strongly Democratic
district, Mr. Pendleton being afterward
elected to Congress. While a member
of the Senate he passed the mutual
savings bank law of the State. For
five years he was West Virginia's mem
ber of the Republican National Com
mittee, and during the entire time was
a member of the executive committee.
During the campaign of 1896 he was
selected by President McKinley to serve
with General Powell Clayton and Vice
President Hobart in the headquarters
in New York City. In recognition of
his services, President McKihley ap
pointed him commissioner of internal
revenue. He organized the first sav
ings bank in the State of West Vir

CARSON, Nev., Jan. 25.â The Legisla
ture met to-day â¢In joint session at 12
o'clock to read the Journals of both
houses and give the vote of the respective
houses. At the conclusion of the reading
of the journal Senator Comins made a
motion to cast ballots to confirm the elec
tion of the day before. This brought out
both forces In arms and argument was in
dulged in. The President finally declared
the motion out of order and then decided
that W. M. Stewart was the choice of the
two houses and was duly elected United
States Senator.
In the Senate in the afternoon things
warmed up. The contest between Boyle
and McCullough came up and Senators
Denton and Comins grew personal, calling
each other everything but gentlemen. .The
seat contested by Lord vs. Conbole was
decided in Lord's favor.
The talk of the House is the scandal re
garding the disappearance of Assembly
man Gillespie. When the vote was called
yesterday he was absent and he has not
been located yet. A committee will meet
to Investigate, and It is liable to bring
others into the muddle.
Senator Stewart will give a reception at
his home in this city on Saturday evening.
He probably will leave for Washington on
Sunday night.
M TJNICIPAL WATER WORKS.
San Luis Obispo Purchases a Com-
plete System.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 25.â The Trus
tees, of this city last night formally agreed
with Messrs. Le Franc & Ryland, repre
sentatives of the San Luis Water Com
pany, for the sale of all property of. the
water ' company to the city for $50,000.
This Is the result of negotiations pending
for many months. The company at one
time asked for $125,000 for the works, but
the citizens showed a determination to put
in a system of their own and voted bonds
for the purpose. The election was de
clared void by the Supreme Court on a
technicality, and a few months ago an

RAILS FROM SAN
JOSE TO ALVISO
New Road May Soon Be
Constructed.
PLANS OF ITS PROMOTERS
ARE ENDEAVORING TO OBTAIN
STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Have Obtained Rights of Way and
Terminals, and the Line May
Be Completed Before
Autumn.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 25.â 1n all probability
San Jose and Alviso will be connected
by a railroad before the close of the
coming summer. The survey was com
pleted and the grade stakes set two
years ago for the Santa Clara Valley
Railway between the two places, and
the rails, iron, tools, fish-plates, piles
and ties have been stored at Alviso
since that time. A right of way for
the entire distance of nine miles, with
the exception of 500 feet, has been ob
tained. An acre and a half of ground
on North First street, within two blocks
of the Hotel Vendome, will be the ter
minal and depot grounds in this city.
At Alviso the company owns sixty-six
acres of water front, giving it a front
age of one and a half miles on the
slough.
The Santa. Clara Valley Railway
Company was incorporated on August
26, 1895, with a capital stock of $100,
--000. About half of this stock was sub
scribed and active operations com
menced. . The right of way and ter
minals were procured and the material
for the road purchased, and then the
funds gave out and work had to be
abandoned. Piper, Aden, Goodall & Co.,
owners of steamers on San Joaquin and
Sacramento rivers, are largely interest
ed in the project and are now endeavor
ing to obtain stock subscriptions
amounting to $15,000 in this county to
aid in finishing the road. If this can
be done they agree to add a like sum,
and claim that $30,000 will equip and
put the road in running order. In case
the stock be subscribed within sixty
days they agree to commence work
within thirty days after that time. Be
sides the right of way and terminals
there is nearly $40,000 worth of track
material on hand. The funds raised
will be devoted to laying track, equip
ing the road, building warehouses and
dredging the channel along the water
front at Alviso.
At the meeting of the Board of Trade
on Friday evening the directors will be
asked to give their support to the pro
ject. H. R. Thayer, the secretary of tho
company, will be present and explain
the situation. It is more than likely
a mass meeting of citizens will be called
in the near future to take some action
toward raising the money.
. The completion of the road means a
boom for San Jose. As it is, a great
deal of freight is received and shipped
by way of Alviso and this route has
been the means of . reducing : railroad
rates. â¢". Assemblyman ' Arnerich has in
troduced a bill in the Legislature to ap
propriate $25,000 to improve Alviso har
bor, and should this become a law and
the railroad be built, the importance
of San Jose's harbor would be in
creased a thousand fold.

mentoâ Solemn
Services.
RECEIVE ye the Holy Ghost for the
office and work of a Bishop in the
church of God. now committed
unto thee by the imposition of our
hands; in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen."
With these solemn words Rev. William
Hall Moreland was elevated to the epis
copate and consecrated Bishop of the dio
cese of Sacramento yesterday morning.
The ceremony, which was held at St.
Luke's Church, was one of the most sol
emn and impressive ever witnessed on
the Pacific Coast.
Before 11 o'clock, the time appointed
for the commencement of the services,
every seat ln the edifice was taken and
still the people crowded in through the
doors. The altar was beautifully decor
ated with lilies and ferns, while myriads
of lights lent their glow to the scene.
Promptly at 11 o'clock the procession
formed at tbe residence of Mr. Moreland,
1812 Van Ness avenue, and moved slowly
to the church, forming a magnificent
pageant. At the head came the cross
bearer, followed by a number of choir
boys in white vestments. Then came the
Brotherhood of St. Andrew in black robes
and the clergy. They formed an avenue
in the center aisle of the church, through
which finally came the Bishop-elect, ac
companied by the consecrating Bishops.
The consecration was performed by the
following ecclesiastics:
Consecratorsâ Rt. Rev. William Ford Nich
ols. D.D., Bishop of California; Rt. Rev. Abiel
Leonard, D.D., Bishop of Salt Lake; Rt. Rev.
John Mills Kendrick, D.D., Bishop of New
Mexico and Arizona.
Preacher- Rt. Rev. William Morris Barker,
D.D.. Bisnop of r>iympia.
Presenters â Rt. Rev. Joseph Horsfall John
ff?.- D,, _ Bishop of Los Angeles: Rt. Rev.
William Morris Parker, D.D.. Bishop of Olym
pia.
t o-consecratorâ Rev. William Wilcox Per
rin. D.D.. Lord Bishop of Columbia B. C.
Present by invitation â Rt. Rev. Tikhon.
Bishop of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, of
the Holy Orthodox Eastern Church.
â¢ Attending Presbytersâ Very Rev. Edgar J.
Lion, Dean of Convocation of San Francisco;
Rev. William Carson Shaw, rector's assistant
Bt. Luke's Church.
Deputy registrarâ Rev. Charles L. Mlel, rector
Bt. Paul's Church. Sacramento.
Master of ceremoniesâ Rev. R. c. Foute, rec
tor Grace Church, San Francisco.
As the procession moved up the chancel
the glorious strains of the hymn "Glori
ous Things of Thee Are Spoken, Zion. City
of our God," were intoned by the congre
gation and an augmented choir. After
the clergy were seated in the chancel the
Rev. C. L. Idle] read the commission to
consecrate from the presiding Bishop.
Right Rev. John Williams, D.D., of Mid
dletown. Conn.
Bishop Nichols then began the commu
nion service. The epistle was read by
Right Rev. Abiel Leonard, and the gospel
by Right Rev. William Wilcox Perrin.
Right Rev William Morris Barker
preached the sermon of the day, taking
for his text, "Go ye and teach all na
tions."
"The first consecration of a Bishop west
of Omaha," he said, "is a memorable oc
casion in our church history. With the
discovery of gold in California and the
frenzy incident thereto there were many
men who did not forget their early
church teaching, and Trinity Church
was formed in this city in 1843;
Grace, in Sacramento, in the same
year, and Grace in San Francisco
in April, 1860. In October. 1853,
delegates from California appeared
in New York and applied for admission
as a diocese. This was denied, but Wil
liam Ingraham Kip was appointed Mis
sionary Bishop of California. In 1556 the
diocese of California was admitted into
the American church, and under the lead
ership of Bishop Kip rapidly advanced.
In VS&S the diocese of California was di
vided and the diocese of Los Angeles
formed. No one has forgotten the strug
gles of Bishop Wingfield. All honor to
Kip and Wingfield. the heroes of the Epis
copal church on the Pacific Coast.
Bishop Barker then gave a history of
the church in America, referring to the
thirty-six churchmen who had signed the
Declaration of Independence. The church
has grown until it has now nineteen mis
sionary divisions governed by Bishops,
forty-five Bishops now have commissions
and there are 104,000 communicants west
of the Mississippi.
"The central figure of the church," said
Bishop Barker, "is Jesus Christ. He Is
the climax of the self-revelation of the
Inner life of God, and brings us more
closely in kinship with our Maker. The
church as a body exists from the day of
Pentecost, when 300 persons were, bap
tized. /
"The kind of Bishop that the church
needs to-day In this Western land is one
who develops a more Christ like manhood
and bends himself before the Savior."
Then turning to Mr. Moreland he re
ferred feelingly to the presiding Bishop
John Williams, who lies sick in Middle
SUED FOR CRIMINAL LIBEL.
T. G. Sawkins Will Institute Proceed-
ings Against Mrs. J. J. Whitney.
Mrs. J. J. Whitney, the trance medium,
has been threatened with a suit for crim
inal libel by T. G. Sawkins, a man of her
own profession. Although Sawkins says
he has not determined upon the suit, nev
theless he has employed an attorney to
institute proceedings against her for what
he claims a scurrilous and criminally li
belous article that was published through
her influence and under her direction In
a local spiritualistic paper.
In speaking of the affair yesterday he
said that there was no absolute uncer
tainty as to whether he would sue the
woman or not.
"I have placed the entire matter in the
hands of my attorney." he said, "and
will be guided by his advice." From this
the inference is deducted by Mrs. Whit
ney that if Hawkins' lawyer thinks there
Is the least possible pretext for filing the
suit he will do all in his power to procure
an indictment against her.
The basis upon which Sawkins is work
. ing is on a published letter In the spirit
ualistic paper claimed to be from the
Chief of Police of Kansas City. In it
he is denounced as a fraud, his record
while practicing his so-called expose of
fake spiritualists in Kansas City being
also outlined.
Sawkins, it is claimed. 4,' as brought
from the East to this coast by the Or
pheum management for the pur
pose of giving public exhibitions of the
"fake" methods which are pursued by
many so-called Spiritualists. It is stated
that he inaugurated these exhibitions In
the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles,
but was drummed out of town after the
first night as an absolute failure.
Since then he has been traveling around
exposing the fraudulent schemes, as he
claims, of local mediums. Few. If any, have
escaped him in his so-called expose. Mrs.
Whitney, however, has come in for the
brunt of his attacks as she claims for no
other reason than that she compelled him
to leave her lodging-house on Stockton
street, his reputation interfering with her
practice. She speaks lightly of the threat
ened suit and says it is simply another of
Sawkins* scheme to ruin her reputation.

CONSECRATION OF REV. W. H. MORELAND AS BISHOP OF SACRAMENTO.
town and from whom his commission was
received. "From the bedside ln Connecti
cut." said he. "from all your comrades,
from me, I say go your way, strong in the
Imitation of St. Paul." - -
At the conclusion of the sermon the
eyes of the assembled congregation were
suffused with tears, for the consecration
of Mr. Moreland has a double signifi
cance. It means an elevation for him, it
is true: but it also means the severing of
those ties by which he has been affil
iated for over five years with the mem
bers of his flock.
Rev. John Partridge, then president of
the standing committee of the mission
ary district of Sacramento, read the cer
tificate of election from the House of
Bishops. Then Bishop Nichols required
the promise of conformity from Mr.
Moreland, who in a steady, deeply moved
voice, repeated the following words:
"In the name of -God. amen. I, Wil
liam Hall Moreland, chosen Bishop of the
Protestant Episcopal church in the mis
sionary district of Sacramento, do prom
ise conformity anu obedience to the doc
trine, discipline and the worship of the
Protestant Episcopal church in the United
States of America. So help me God,
through Jesus Christ."
An so, in clear and firm voice, he sub
scribed to the articles in which he was
examined by Bishop Nichols until the
final words were uttered and the laying
'on of hands made him the Bishop of Sac
ramento.
This was followed by a long prayer ser
vice and Mendelssohn s beautiful anthem,
"Now Are We Embassadors in the Nam*
of Christ," was most sympathetically
rendered ior the offertory.
The consecration service was followed
by the communion, and. it -was not until
the middle of the afternoon that the
clergy left the church, singing "Fling Out
the Banner."
As a preliminary to the consecration
there was early celebration of holy com
munion at St. Luke's Church, the cele
brant being Rt. Rev. J. H. Johnson. The
morning prayer was said at 9 a. m. at
St. Paul's Church, those officiating being

ACTRESS FEARFUL
OF HER ANATOMY
Story of Miss Fitzallen,
an Obstinate Manager
and a Pair of Tights.
C HE Alcazar management is once more up against it, and again,
this time, it is the leading lady and a pair of flesh colored tights.
Some little while ago Manager Thall decided to produce "All the
Â Comforts of. Home." in which play the leading lady is seen, for
j 1 one brief instant, in the garb suitable for the leader of the Ama
zon march. In those days Gretchen Lyons was leading lady at
the O'Farrell street house. -Gretchen was In love with Hastings, the lead
ing man, and she borrowed Just enough time from her billing and cooing
to say most emphatically "I won't" to the man who ruled the rate of the
; theater. Gretchen had a soft voice and a square chin, and her "won't"
went. Now Miss Fitzallen is leading lady at the Alcazar, and Thall
wants to produce the "Bachelor's Honeymoon," In which the leading lady,
for one fleeting moment, appears in a costume that is a happy cross be
tween â¢ a fashionable bathing suit and the dress in which Rosalind ; fools
Orlando. /â¢' ! :i 'â â '. /
Miss Fitzallen is tall and stately. Her voice is musical and her chin
marked with a perfect love of a dimple. Miss Fitzallen says:. "I never <
. have and really I cant." Manager Thall says "You must," and Stage Man
ager Bryant murmurs, "There is a pleasure in store for you, madame."
In statu quo: the matter now stands and the betting up at the* theater is
, 2 to 1 in favor of the management. '.-V's
No false idea of modesty is ' the disturbing element in Miss Fltzal- '
len's aversion to tights. "I never have worn the things," the actress ex
plained, "and really ; I'm afraid 1 won't show up well in them."
"There Is plenty of excelsior about the theater," says Thall, . "and
what more can- any woman want?'* feÂ«s"??_J

MONEY ACCOUNTED FOB.
Colonel Berry Tells How the $1000
Bed Cross Donation Was
Distributed.
Colonel Berry of the lately discharged
Seventh California Regiment has sub
mitted a report which accounts for the
$1000 given to the regiment by the Red
Cross Society of this city last August and
over which so much discussion arid specu
lation- arose a short time ago. Berry re
turned to Mrs. W. B. Harrington of this
city $200 on December 15. 1898, and on Jan
uary 17 and 18 of this year he turned over
to Mrs. Griffith of the . Los Angeles Red
Cross Society $249 18. The balance, includ
ing $1 15 for telegrams, was spent for
necessities for the soldiers of his regi
ment before they went out of service.
A list of these expenditures accompany
the report and every dollar of the $1000 is
accounted for; $177 75 was given to the Sis
ters' Hospital at Los Angeles for care of
patients who were too sick . to be cared
for in the camp. This amount was one
half the hospital's regular rates. Tho
other items are: $141 for board and lodg
ing of convalescents, $90 for nurses, $35 for
temporary hospital quarters adjacent to
Camp Merrltt, $45 40 for medical supplies
at Camp Pratt, $19 40 for meals for guard
at Camp Merrltt, $16 for potatoes, $6 05
for bread and coffee for sick en route to
Los Angeles, $6 12 for supplies for sick at
Mojave, $4 50 for chloride of lime, $3 60 for
sawdust at Camp Pratt, $3 35 for fuel and
laundry at Camp Pratt, and $1 50 for to
bacco for patient in United States Army
Post Hospital at San Diego. The money
was only expended in cases where there
was no source of supply from the Govern
ment. . ..'
The communication and report are ad
dressed to Mrs. John F. Merrill, president
of the San Francisco Red Cross Society,
from whom Berry received the funds.

HIGHTON'S STRONG ARGUMENT
Builds/ a Case Against Officer Ken
ville, Willie Lynch 's Assailant.
The fate of Officer Kenville, charged
with having fractured Willie Lynch's
skull with a club last September, will be
determined this morning. Yesterday's
session was taken up by the defense.
Many witnesses were put on the stand,
among them being George A. Jewett, P.
H. Myer, D. E. Goldstone, Henry T.
Jones, Charles E. Helsel, William Brltt
and A. F. Lillie, the majority simply tes
tifying that they did not see the officer
throw his club, while the last two named
stated that they had examined the club
alleged to have been thrown by the officer
some time after the occurrence and found
no dents or marks upon it.
The case was submitted, and Attorney
Henry E. Highton made a strong argu
ment for the prosecution. He took the
testimony of the individual witnesses, an
alyzed it and rewove it into a strong case
against the accused. To-day Frank Mc-
Gowan will argue for the defense and
Assistant District Attorney Black will
close for the prosecution. The case will
then go to the jury. â '";:;,-

A Big Land Suit Now
in the Courts.
LIKE THE VALLEY CLAIMS
SUITS WILL BE DISMISSED FOB
A CONSIDERATION.
A Cloud Now Hangs Over the Deeds
of Hundreds of Holders of
Small Pieces of Real
Estate.
;
~
A case has recently cropped up in
the Superior Court which not only in
volves thousands of dollars in small
holdings, but has created a small panic
among real estate men and hundreds of
people who own building lots on the old
Rancho Rincon de las Salinas or Bernal
Rancho. . ;
This piece of land, which lies along
the old San Jose road, was years ago
granted by the old Mexican Governor.
After several changes it became the
property of Joseph Mora Moss, Harvey
S. Brown, Francois L. A. Pioche, Henry
A. Cobb and John Francis Cobb.
On October 30, 1860, they sold the
piece of land, amounting to some 200
acres, to the Islais and Salinas Water
Company, a corporation formed to pur
chase it. â ''} '''â  .--'â 
The land thus acquired was divided
into building lots and disposed of.
The first record of sale is dated Janu
ary 2, 1861, and states that a certain
plat of land was sold to Henry B. Pot
ter and Abel Wade. The deed bears
the signature, "Islais and Salinas
Water Company, by F. L. A Pioche,
H. A. Cobb and C. de Boom, trustees,"
and hereby hangs the tale.
There was no common seal of the
company and there are no records ex
tant which show that the three gentle
men aforementioned ever were trustees
or had the right to sell the land. They
simply signed and used their individual
seals.
Hundreds of people bought lots and
accepted the deeds given by the three
so-called "trustees." These deeds have
held without contest for the past thirty
years or more, but somebody has at
last found a loophole in these deeds.
After passing through various hands
one of the deeds came into the hands
of Mary rsarney. She found her lot al
ready in the possession of John Pforr.
She entered suit for possession in the
Superior Court, but lost, the court hold
ing that, for various reasons, the title
from the three trustees was not valid.
The case was carried to the Supreme
Court, which upheld the decision of
the lower court. In his opinion Judge
Searles said:
"Proof was made that the corpora
tion grantor had three trustees, but
there was no proof that the parties
signing the deed were such trustees,
nor was there any authority shown
from the corporation to any one to
make the sale or to convey the land,
nor was there any resolution ratifying
such conveyance."
This was the beginning of the pres
ent suit, which is simply a suit against
all who hold deeds signed byithe three
trustees, instituted by two unknown
parties, who claim to be the two sur
vivors of the old corporation. They
claim that there is no official record of
the three trustees who signed the orig
inal deeds, that, according to the Bar
ney-Pforr decision, the deeds are value
less, and accordingly sue for the prop
erty.
Among the holders are the California
Title Insurance and Trust Company,
the Hibernia Bank and other large con
cerns, all of which have for years been
passing on these titles.
It is stated that the complainants in
the case have agreed to settle up and
give a clear title to any defendant who
will pay them 2 per cent of the present
assessed valuation of their property
and state that some have already paid
up. ; : ..'.;- ; /'
Others look upon it as a scheme and
are determined . to fight the case to a
finish. Among these is M. Salomon. He
placed his individual case in an attor
ney's hands, but the attorney finds him
self at sea to a certain extent.
He characterizes the whole thing as
a scheme and, owing to the peculiar
attitude of the plaintiffs, will find it
difficult to bring his client out on top.
"The plaintiffs," he says, "have told us
that if we file an answer they will im
mediately dismiss the case. We can
have it dismissed readily ourselves, in
fact, by pleading the statute of limita
tions, but this is not what we want. If
we make any such plea, the prosecu
tion will move for the dismissal of the
case and the titles of the land will for
ever remain under a cloud. Their pos
session by the present owners may
never be disputed, but should they be
sold, the case would be revived again.
"What we want to do is to force a
trial of the case. If this can be done,
and we think it can, we will prove a
negative possession, or that the water
company has neither been in possession
of nor paid taxes on the lands for the
past five years, and this will give us a
clear title. There are many peculiar
things regarding this case. For in
stance, the complaint was never sworn
to, and it is not alleged that the com
plainant is a corporation nor are the
names of the complainants given. This
may prevent us from filing a cross com
plaint, but we will, in our answer, ask
for relief, and I think we have a suffi
ciently clear case, to enable us to get
a quiet title if the thing is ever brought
to trial. All we want is a fair trial
and we will prove that the water com
pany has really no title."
The whole case promises to form one
of the most interesting ones involving
land titles that has been heard in the
courts since the famous Noe Valley
suits and' may end in the same way.
It is strongly hinted that there is a
combination back of the whole thing
and the suits were instituted to make
up for the depression in real estate and
fill the pockets of certain shrewd specu
lators and lawyers.

It ia a dismal thing: to be dropping: out of ths

GAS LEGISLATION.
SENATOR HALL has introduced. a bill in the
Senate to discipline gas companies. The
measure provides that no charges shall be col
lected for gas furnished through meters which have
not been tested by meter inspectors appointed by the
municipal authorities or cities. It further fixes the
maximum price for gas at Si per thousand cubic
feet, though this provision does not apply to any but
cities of the first class, which means San Francisco.
Senator Hall's bill in providing for the supervision
of gas meters may be heartily commended, and some
such law should be framed; but it is useless for him
to try to fix the price of gas by legislation. Ex
perience has demonstrated that competition is the
only thing that will in the long run regulate the j
charges of gas as well as other corporations.
If Senator Hall's bill should pass the gas com
panies would immediately place themselves in the
position occupied by the railroads, which in no event ;
pay dividends. Should a test case be brought before i
the courts the Judges would say that regulation must
be reasonable, and if a corporation does not pay
lends its charges cannot be regulated, because
any regulation at all without dividends is unreason
able.
There is a point, however, in connection with gas
companies to which Senator Hall might very prop
erly direct his attention. It is the custom of the cor
porations in San Francisco, at least, to exact deposits
for meters. The law does not authorize any such
exaction â on the contrary, it inferentially discoun
tenances it â but by bulldozing and threatening the
gas companies are generally able to get their de
posits. In other words, they take advantage of the
ignorance of their patron*; to cinch them. This thing
ought to be stopped. The gas companies have no
more right to exact security for their bills than the
water companies, railroad companies or street car
companies. If the consumers of gas do not pay,
their supply may be shut off. Thus a complete
remedy is provided for swindling consumers.
What Senator Hall should do is to abandon this
impractical measure and substitute for it a bill for
bidding the gas companies to charge for setting, up
meters. A law to this effect would be constitutional
and would be sustained by the courts, besides meet
ing the approbation of large numbers of people who
are now regularly compelled to disgorge by the gas
companies.
THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY BILL.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY asks of the State
:he adoption of a constitutional amendment
confirming the founding of the university and
the trust under which it was endowed, the grant of
additional powers to the trustees, and incidentally
an exemption of the university grounds and buildings I
from taxation. <
It will be with surprise the people learn that this
great trust so elaborately provided for by Stanford
for the maintenance of the university is at this late
day supposed to be defective. It is said that good
legal authorities are of the opinion the trust is of
doubtful legality because it goes beyond the provi
sions of the constitution and in some respects does
not conform to the enabling acts of 1885 and 1887. It
is added that in the judgment of these authorities the
only way to avoid trouble and make secure to the
university the great property with which it has been
endowed is to adopt the proposed constitutional
amendment.
In addition to the confirmation of the trust as it
stands, Stanford asks that further powers be conferred
upon her trustees so that they may accept donations
of property wherever situated. That is of importance
because it is believed Stanford's brother, who re
sides in Australia, may devote a considerable portion 1
of his large estate to the endowment of the great
university which will stand for all time as a monu
ment of the Stanford family.
That fa- all is well enough. Whatever defect there
may be in the act creating the trust under which the
university is maintained should be remedied. Its
legality and validity should be placed beyond a doubt.
The request for the exemption of grounds and build
ings from taxation, however, raises another question
altogether. Stanford is not a State institution. It
was founded for the purpose of perpetuating a colos
sal private fortune, and is so devised that its huge
landed estates can never be sold.
It is conducted, moreover, like any private school
for the benefit of its trustees and faculty. That the
benefit is no greater than they merit is true, but
there is no reason why the property on which the
benefit rests should be exempt from taxation any,
more than any other school, college or institute that
is conducted for individuals or corporations and not
for the whole public under State control.
There are a good many institutions of merit in
California fully as much entitled to exemption from
taxation as Stanford University. Moreover, they are
not so rich as that institution and not so able to pay.
Neither do they hold in the dead hand of a trust any.
of those large estates in land the existence of which is
adverse to the general welfare. The grant of the pro
posed exemption to Stanford, therefore, will open the
door for similar requests from all sorts of institutions,
many of which may be just, but it will be difficult to
shut the door again before gross abuses come in.

THE EXAMINER'S" ST. VITUS DANCE.
THE Examiner started its "national policy" by
demanding the election of W. J. Bryan to the
Presidency in 1896. It was soundly beaten. In
1898, during our war with Spain, it "expanded"
quite rapidly, but the next definite phase of its "na
tional policy" was the advocacy of the fusion ticket
on the fusion platform, the object of which was to
deliver this State over to the socialistic element in the
Democratic party. It was again thoroughly beaten.
After the election it resumed the expansion business,
and has passed through the successive phases, with
intervals betweeen them, of hysteria and epilepsy.
During its epileptic condition the only sound the
community heard from the Examiner for weeks was
its hammer driving nails through the American flag
and its screams when its own fingers were hit. Sud
denly that noise ceased, and, for a considerable time,
the "national policy" subsided. We had begun to
hope that, under the treatment of The Call, which
in other directions had proved so efficacious, the Ex
aminer was being restored to health, or at least that
its principal disease had been arrested. But appear
ances were deceitful, as they often are in that class
ci disorders which are accompanied by mental
aberration. On Tuesday last the "national policy"
burst loose with all the previous symptoms, to which
was added a new complication that resembled St.
Vitus dance. We fear that the latest devel
opment presents a hopeless case. "We now de
mand," says the Examiner, in the blackest of black
type, of the largest size, "the government of our new
territories as integral parts of the country, according
to the American idea." It seems, therefore, that we
are now to take the Philippines, as American terri
tory, to be converted into States. This "American
idea" that has aroused the Examiner to an insane
fanaticism, only equaled by the Mohammedans in a
"holy war, is the most convincing proof of its mania
that we have yet discerned. There is not an expan
sionist in Congress who has dared to suggest the ab
sorption of 9,000,000 or 10,000,000 of Filipinos,
300,000 of whom are nominal Christians and the
remainder pagans and polygamists of various Asiatic
types, into the American nation. Still less has the
dream of the State of Manila filled the diseased imagi
nation of any advocate of annexation, however ex
treme. The Examiner alone has reached a condi
tion so acute that it burns to include the Chinese,
the Malays, the Mohammedans and all the various sub
divisions of Asiatic barbarism that compos, the popu
lation of the Philippines, in the strong embrace of
American nationality.
The immediate occasion of this last frenzy was a
letter sent by W. J. Bryan to an anti-expansion meet
ing in New York that was addressed by Bourke
Cochran and received a sympathetic communication
from Mr. Cleveland. Mr. Bryan lately has kicked
over the "national policy" traces by trying to sub
stitute anti-expansion for free silver at 16 to I as an
issue in 1900. Naturally he has temporarily found
himself in some good company, from which he had
been long excluded, and which would doubtless
exact from him sincere penitence and a period of
total abstinence from political ambition before he
would be restored to complete fellowship. But the
Examiner, having modestly characterized Senator
Hoar of Massachusetts and some other leading Amer
ican statesmen who oppose imperialism as "old
grannies," is now driven into an ecstacy of blended
madness and terror by the "delectable companions,"
as it terms them, upon whom Mr. Bryan desires ap
parently to force his recognition. If there is in the
United States a man, twice President, who has passed
into history as the foremost modern exponent of
American Democracy, that man is Grover Cleveland,
whose name and whose character are respected, even
while his political ideas are opposed, by the Repub
lican party. This gentleman, together with Senator
Hoar, Professor Sumner, Carl Schurz, Edward At
kinson, Andrew Carnegie, all of whom are named by
the Examiner, and a host of other orators, statesmen,
thinkers and scholars, who maintain Americanism and
resist imperialism to the death, would undoubtedly,
in a true sense, prove to be "delectable companions"
for Mr. Bryan or any other persons whom they might
honor by their society. But they are spitefully re
pudiated and ostracized by the Examiner, which,
having worn out the nailing process, is now deter
mined, to re-employ an expression of Oliver Wen
dell Holmes we used a few days ago, that its exclu
sive "national policy" "shall go clattering down the
corridors of time like a tinkettle to a dog's tail."
Clearly the Examiner is past aid from any Ameri
can physician, and is unable to retain upon its stom
ach even broken doses of the constitution. We ex
pect soon to write the epitaph of its "national policy."
A QUESTION FOR THE PEOPLE.
SENATOR BRAUNHART has done well in
presenting to the Legislature a joint resolution
directing the Governor to insert in his next
general election proclamation a clause calling upon
the electors to declare their wishes upon the ques
tion of so amending the State constitution as to pro
vide for the election of United States Senators by
direct vote of the people.
The issue has been long discussed, and it is full
time to submit it in a definite form to the supreme
authority in the State. The evil results of contests
i-i the Legislatures over the election of Senators have
been noted for a considerable period, and they are
increasing in extent and magnitude. At the present
time there are grave scandals over these contests in
such widely separated States as Delaware, Montana,
Pennsylvania and Nevada. It is hardly necessary to
review what is going on at Sacramento.
The evils of these contests, as The Call has already
pointed out, include not only bribery by money in
some cases, and by the debauchery of the public ser
vice by the promise of political patronage to un
worthy persons in others, but also the trading of
votes on appropriation measures for the sake of win
ning support for candidates. Indirectly there is in
volved the delay in the transaction of legislative
business, which never fails to result in the neglect of
important work that ought to be undertaken. rry
Out of these scandals there has come a demand
for a change in the mode of electing Senators which
is as widespread as the Union itself. An amendment
to the national constitution has been strongly urged
as the only possible remedy for the evil. It is, how
ever, a difficult task to accomplish an amendment of
that kind. California need not wait until the whole
Union is prepared for the reform before she under
takes it for her own relief.
If the people of California desire to work out their
own salvation in the matter a method could be de
vised by which the electors would vote directly for
Senatorial candidates, and then the Legislature on
assembling would have nothing to do except
to ratify the popular choice and proceed at once to a
consideration of State affairs.
The reform would begin its good work by
eliminating the Senatorial issue from the contests for
seats in the Legislature, and candidates in the various
districts would not be chosen because they are for or
against a particular aspirant for the Senate. The
whole elaborate system of bribing or bullying legis

lators to espouse the cause of a candidate for the
Senate would be at once destroyed.
The argument upon the subject is virtually ex
hausted, for it has long been discussed and every
phase of it fully presented. No good reason can be
assigned, therefore, for any further delay in submit
ting it to the people. It must be left to them in the
end, and the next general election will be a good
time to take a preliminary vote on it.
THE SHADOWS OF IMPERIALISM.
CONGRESS in its declaration of war against
Spain last year said: "The people of Cuba are
and ought to be free and independent." The
news dispatches from Havana January 24 say: "Gen
eral Rabi, with 1500 insurgents, has taken to the hills
in Santa Clara in defiance of American authority.
They will be followed by a force of United States
cavalry and persistently pursued. Rabi is a full
blooded Guantanamo Indian and a hard fighter. The
same general method will be observed by the Ameri
can forces as has been followed in dealing with the
Indians on the plains and mountains of the West."
The Manila dispatch of the same day said: "Aguin
aldo. authority is generally recognized. Every
available male is being recruited, and arms depots
are being established at large towns. There are 30,000
Filipinos under arms."
A Washington dispatch of the same date says:
"There are three factors in the Philippine situation
which are forcing" the President to action. First,
Aguinaldo 's hostile attitude and the constant growth
of his army; second, the danger of smallpox on
board the transports, which are the prisons of Miller's
expedition to Iloilo; third, the danger of recogni
tion of the Philippine republic by foreign Govern
ments, especially Germany and Spain." In the local
new columns of the San Francisco press of the same
date appeared the petition of six hundred parents of
volunteers in the First California Regiment, now in
the Philippines, asking the President to send them
home, which declares: "And whereas, long detention
in a tropical climate is undermining the health and
spirits of many of our best young men who gave
their services to their country when hostilities were
actually pending, to be called home is the most
ardent wish of almost every enlisted man in said regi-
ment."
The purpose for which war was declared was com
pleted with the Spanish surrender.
The above news of one day is an exhibit of what
has followed our abandonment of that purpose to
enter upon a career of conquest.
The object of the Cuban revolution was indepen
dence of the Cubans. The object of the Philippine
revolution was independence of the Filipinos. The
Porto Ricans did not revolt and had no desire to
change from Spanish sovereignty.
We have assumed to them all the attitude of a con
queror and not that of a deliverer. Perhaps at this
moment our troops are in the mountains of Santa
Clara province slaughtering the patriot band of Rabi,
or being slaughtered. We have stepped into Spain's
shoes in Havana and Manila and have taken up her
fight against the aspirations of the people for inde
pendence and nationality.
Rabi has done in Cuba just what Maceo and
Gomez did, has adopted the same military tactics
which he and they used against Spain. When Spain
was the victim of their methods patriotic passion was
torn to tatters in Congress and in the press of this
country in ascribing to their acts the highest motives
that can actuate the lovers of liberty, and they were
ranked with Washington. Now Rabi's resort to the
mountains is called, in the dispatch, "brigandage,"
and it is added that we propose "to show what United
States soldiers can do to suppress it." The Cubans
seem to have exchanged King Log for King Stork.
Over all hovers the declaration that "the President
feels he cannot wait much longer upon the Senate.
Instructions will be sent to Admiral Dewey and Gen
eral Otis to either withdraw Miller's expedition or
to assert the supremacy of the United States, peace
ably if possible, forcibly if necessary."
The constitution says: "The Congress shall have
power to declare war." Has it declared war against
the Cubans and Filipinos? They each have organ
ized governments and a military force equipped with
arms. What right has the President to declare war
against either?
Going to the speeches made by Piatt and other
imperialists, his authority is discovered in their
declaration that the constitution of the United States
applies only to the States of the United States. This
misapplication of a dictum of Mr. Webster is used by
the imperialists to cover the use of autocratic power
by the President outside of the States of the United
States. That is to say, within the Union he is a con
stitutional President; outside, under a policy of con
quest and imperialism, he is an Oriental despot. He
is President at home, but Emperor in Cuba and the
Philippines.
If Rabi is followed into the mountains of Santa
Clara, and force is used in the Philippines, we will
have crossed the Rubicon, and in that dark future
that stretches from the further shore are the sighs
and tears of many times six hundred parents praying
that their sons be saved from the destruction wrought
by a tropical climate.

WHAT DOES MR. CRAIG REPRESENT?
To the Editor of The San Francisco,
Call: The.irrepressible Hugh Craig, ex
president of the San Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce and president of the
Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress,
has addressed a memorial to the Con
gress of the United States, urging that
the proposed Hanna-Payne shipping
bill be amended to include protection
for agriculture by a bounty on exports.
Hugh Craig states that he is glad to
note that an effort is being made for
the protection of shipping. In this he
intimates the necessity for such pro
tection, but he then proceeds to petition
Congress to kill the efforts for shipping
protection by tacking on an agricul
tural bounty feature, which itself was
killed during the past two years by an
absolutely irrefutable proof that our
agricultural products do not need a
bounty, as witnessed by the enormous
prices realized for farm products dur
ing the past two years. During a sea
son of low prices for grain it seemed to
some that it would be advisable, as a
possible solution for bringing the
farmer out of his rut and to enable him
to lift his mortgages, to grant him an
export bounty. However, before the
public could be educated up to such a
radical measure one good season came
along and wiped out over 50 per cent
of the mortgages, and they are gradu
ally being wiped out ever since. Doe 3
not this prove to any sane man that
Providence aids the farmer without the
necessity for legislation granting boun
ties? Does Providence work in such a
direct manner in behalf of shipping?
Not at all. Shipping can only be ob
tained by legislation, but nature, which
fortunately is not controlled by poli
ticians, regulates the crops of the world
and each year creates many millions
of new mouths to feed. New markets
also are constantly forming, and the
rise of the farmer is inevitable; nothing
but a holocaust can stop it. He did
not need a bounty in 1897; nor in 1898;
nor will he need it in 1899. But where
does our shipping stand? On the ped
estal of* disgrace. In everything have
we progressed but in this. Has not our
recent war taught us a lessonâ not
enough vessels to move a few thousand
soldiers without disrupting our trade;
and, while those who have the sense to
see the folly of our lack of shipping
have framed a bill to enable us to take
our place on the ocean, there is no lack
REAL ESTATE
IS STEADILY
PROGRESSING
Big Sale of the F. A.
Schwartz Property.
MOST IMPORTANTOF THEYEAR
IT INVOLVES THE ESTIMATED
PRICE OF $100,000.
A Complete Review of Realty Rec
ords, New Building Contracts,
Recent Sales and Gen
eral Notes.
Rapid development still characterizes
the world of realty. Everywhere, both in
the city and throughout the State, a
marked improvement is reported in real
estate. In addition to the increase of
sales property is receiving a better price
than formerly, which fact alone conclu
sively proves that the period of business
stagnation that has characterized the
market for many months has been sub
stituted by a healthty condition of pro
gression. ~y :'y-y:y
In the local market the present week
was commenced with the negotiation of
one of the largest sales that have been
recorded for nearly a year. The sale con
sists of the property on the northerly
line of Ellis street, fifty-five feet west of
Jones. It comprises an area of 52:6 feet
by 120 feet. Erected upon it is a five
story brick building which runs the full
length of the lot, terminating at the small
street that runs directly in the rear. The
property was bought through the agency
of A. M. Speck & Co. by L. H. Sly from
its former owner, F. A. Schwartz. The
estimated price paid for it is $100,000,
which was given partly in cash and the
exchange of other buildings owned by
Sly. The Interest on the investment is
said to be far greater than that usually
paid on property of this kind. ; -"ââ¢*>* r : . -â.':
Building operations during the past
week were greater both in number and
value than those recorded during the pre
ceding seven days. Many contracts were
let for the erection of buildings in nearly
every section of the city, which Indicates
a general improvement and dissipates the
old theory that building Is destined to be
restricted to but a few favored districts.
Mortgages for the week were fewer in
number and value than those recorded
during the entire last quarter of the past
year.
During the week there were fifty-nine
mortgages and trust deeds recorded,
amounting to an aggregate value of $158,
--771. For the same period fifty-two re
leases and reconveyances passed to record
in the total sura of $184,470.
The principal mortgages and trust deeds
are as follows: By the Mutual Savings
Bank to A. S. Baldwin, $9000. for one year
at 6_ per cent, on property in Western
Addition Block 238. situated on the south
erly line of Washington street, 70:10 feet

north 108:9; by Ferdinand Rels to Robert
D. Cunningham, $6500 on property ln the
50-vara block 241, situated on the south
east corner of Washington and Reed
streets: by the Hibernia Savings and
Loan Society sto Julia McSweeney, $8690
for ono year at 6*2_ per cent, on property
in Mission Block 100, situated on the
southwest corner of Thirteenth and San
chez streets, west 80 by south 100.
The principal releases and reconvey
ances passed to record - follow: From
the Mutual Savings Bank to A. S. Bald
win, $10,500 on property In the Western
Addition Block 238, situated on the south
erly line of Washington street, 70:10 feet
of those short-sighted, selfish minds
who would defeat the object by de
manding legislation the absurdity of
which has been amply demonstrated.
Mr. Hugh Craig quotes Mr. Cramp,
the eminent shipbuilder, as advocating
the policy of a bounty on foreign ex
ports. This occurred in 1895. when the
granger element was conspicuous, and
for the ship-owner it appeared to be a
question of part hog or none. What
sense is there in the argument that it
would be better for the American farm
er to pay tens of millions of dollars an
nually to foreigners rather than to
Americans for the transportation of his
products to market? Mr. Hugh Craig
claims that if Americans are helped to
build and operate vessels It will cause
the farmer to pay higher freight rates.
Did protection to steel rails make the
railroads pay more for their tracks?
Possibly it did for a short while, but
how did it soon result, and what is the
outcome to-day? Will not protection to
American shipping eventually result in
the same lessening of the cost of trans
portation?
Let American ships obtain a grasp
on the ocean carrying trade; they will
not always require a bounty in order
to hold it, and they will not now. or at
any time, if granted protection, in
crease the cost one iota in the carriage
of farm products. The farmer has
nothing to fear in seeing his neighbor
prosperous, for that neighbor's pros
perity is essential to his own. Let us
have ships. Let us have to spend in
this country the millions which we now
lavishly pay out to foreigners. Is it
asking too much?
We have thousands upon thousands
of unemployed. Will a bounty to farm
ers on grain help these people? Not at
all. What is needed is the upbuilding
of new industries that will furnish
work for the idle, and there is no
grander achievement to be prayed for
than the restoration of the United
States to Its former position in the
ocean carrying trade. Absolutely es
sential to the prosperity of the farmer
are consumers, and the more consumers I
there are the better for the farmer: !
but these consumers must have new in
dustries created for them, and the ag
riculturist should not be jealous of
legislation for such purposes.
It is pertinent here to ask Mr. Hugh
Craig whom he represents in memori
alizing Congress. Is he authorized by
the Trans-Mississippi Congress to re
vive the old issue of bounty on exports,
or does he use the title of president to
make more effective his own particular
views? F. S. SAMUELS.

which the following is taken in regard to
the "steelhead trout:" "Certain fish
found in Eel River, in salt water, during
the month of September, ranging from
one-third of a pound to one pound, were
sent by the commission to Professor
David S. Jordan, president of the Leland
Stanford Jr. University. He pronounces
the young trout â 'steelheads.' salmo
gairdmeri.Rlchardsons." In another bulle
tin there is: "They correspond more
nearly to the salmon trout than any other
of our American species. The name sal
mon trout is promiscuously used for all
sorts of large trout or small salmon, but
if any fish on this west coast is entitled
to this name it is the 'steelhead.' " The
term steel head Is applied to a species of
large trout or small salmon that is dis
tinguished by the fact that its head has
the appearance of bright, shining steel.

inquiry: "I am going to attend a wedding

and witnesses, two in number, the mar
riage to take place out of town. What I
want to know id: Is it proper on an occa
sion of that kind for the groom to wear
white gloves while going from the car
riage to the parlor of the minister who is
to perform the ceremony, or to the church
in which the ceremony shall be per
formed? Should, the bridesmaid remove
the glove from the hand of the bride in
order that the ring may he placed on it,
or should the bride herself remove the
glove? Should the bride appear without
Jewelry other than the engagement ring?"
On an occasion of that kind the groom
should wear gloves, the color under the
circumstances being a matter of taste.
The bridesmaid is not called on to re
move the glove from the hand of the
bride. The bride usually has the ring finger
of the left hand glove cut off, and slips
it on the ring finger, after having put on
the glove, so that at the proper time she
can take the glove finger off to allow the
ring to be placed on the finger. The bride
should always wear the engagement ring.
The bride should not make a display of
jewelry at a wedding, private or public.

A well modulated plunge sent Alvero
to the post, a teetering favorite for the
opening seven furlong run. Once fourth,
he finished in the ruck. Bflry McClosky,
i Ii to I shot with Jones up, led from
start to finish, with Eventide, a 40 to 1
cnoice. landing in the place.
The six furlong sprint for three-year
olds that followed was a very openbettlng
a_air. In a hard drive Spencer brought
'.The Fretter up, downing Sir Urian. the
second choice, a neck. Ann Page, fairiy
well backed, was third.
Spencer again made himself conspicuous
in the five furlong scramble. Everybody

Track Notes.
Spencer's artistic saddle work drew out
many favorable criticisms. Spencer can
sit still on a horse during a race longer
than an old maid awaiting a proposal of
marriage.
On Tuesday G. W. Scott disposed of his
fast colt Strongoll to Murry & Purser.
At the finish of the mile and a sixteenth
Thorpe took Torsida up and lodged a
claim of foci against Spencer, who rode
the winner, Hohenatollem. The judges
thought it the time-honored bluff, once
worked by Willie Martin with consider
able success at Ingleside, and refused to
hearken. Charley was very wrathy on his
return to the paddock, and it is just pos
sible that Spencer did become a trifle too
affectionate. The latter performed the
trick once at Ingleside with Horatio, when
that horse "did not" swerve.
Aluminum was much the best in his
race. Spencer -..cd with both saddle
girths ken.
Ed Purser thought so lightly of the
chances of his horse, Cromwell, that he
bet COO on Frohman. BUI Murry, the
portly trainer of Cromwell, said that 2 to |
5 against David Tenny looked so fascin
ating that he could not resist It. and bet
a COO marker.

TWENTY-SIX IN THE PARTY
JAY EATON, "INDOOR KING," IS
AMONG THEM.
Also Prank Waller of Alameda, Who
Has Gained Fame in the East
As a Long-Distance
Bider.
Another large party of Eastern rac- 1
j ing wheelmen arrived here last evenins. :
j There are twenty-six in the party, !
i and twenty-one of them represent
â¢ the long-distance cracks of the world, !
men from every clime almost. includ

! way, Italy, Austria, with a sprinkling !
of Americans.
F. Ed. Spooner, the famous cycling ;
writer, and his wife, accompanied the
party, besides two celebrated short-dis
tance sprinters, Jay Eaton, the king of
indoor riders, and Teddy Goodman.
Harry Elkes, Michael's greatest rival.
was expected with them, but stopped '
off to visit his parents. He will be here ;
the last of the week.
Eaton, the indoor chamDion. was seen j
here at the Pavilion two years ago. and
at that time won more purses than any
one else, a proceeding which he carries
out at almost every meet. Goodman is
new to the coast, but has a great repu
tation as a sprinter.
The six-day men Include Frank Wal
ler of Alameda, who left here five years
ago, after breaking the world's twenty
four hour record, to try his fortunes
against the Eastern cracks. He has
been wonderfully successful, and re
turns with a - ell-earned reputation as
one of the leaders in the six-day game,
Waller feasted his eyes on the city as
the ferry crossed the bay. noting every
change with interest. "I want to get '
up early to-morrow morning." he said,
"and take my favorite old ride to San
Jose and back before lunch."
The others in the party are Oscar
Julius, Henry Piikington. King Ryan.
Earl Stevens, Charles Ashinger. who
has been at the game for over ten
years; Louis Gimm. Ed Leonard..
Frank Zimpfer, Barney Feeney. Charles

has been in this country but a few
months, is the owner and rider of the
celebrated petroleum tandem, the fast
est peeing machine for bicycle races In
the world. Seated on this machine.
Fournier can set a pace fast enough for
any rider, even Champion Michael him
self, and he is in great demand at race
meets. - â¢
Fournier was " much Impressed with
the mildness of the weather here at this
time of the year, and also with the yells
of the backnien and hotel runners at
the ferry when he landed. He could
not make it all out until told, and
thought they were a lot of bicycle club
men who had come down to bid the
Eastern riders welcome.
Eaton, Goodman and many of the
six-day men will go down to San Jose
next Sunday to see the bicycle races
there.
WAS INJURED FOR LIFE.
Actor 2_orri_on Sues the City Street
Improvement Company.
Albert J. Morrison, the well-known act
or, has sued the City Street Improvement
Company to recover damages ln the sum
of $10,000 for permanent and personal in
juries. During the repaying of Market
street the defendant corporation estab
lished a bitumen-heating apparatus at
Powell and Market streets. From the top
of the steam chest leading to the ground
a plank was laid, on which the bitumen
was wheeled and dumped Into the big
receptacle.
On August 22 last Mr. Morrison and a
companion were going home after mid
night. The electric lights in the neighbor
hood had been put out and the street was
quite dark. No light, it is alleged, shone
to mark the presence of the plank and no
guard was placed around it. Mr. Morri
son started to run to catch a car. struck
the plank and was buried to the pave
ment. The ligaments of the actor's right
leg were ruptured and he was weeks in
bed as a result. He states that he is In
formed by bia physicians that his injuries
are of a permanent character, and there
fore asks that he be awarded $10,000 dam
ages. Smith, Drury & Lynch have been j
retained by Mr. Morrison to prosecute j
his claim.

by the publication of a dispatch from New !
York that the Vanderbilt- would soon ex- j

ter Into a warfare with the Southern and
Central Pacific, owned by C. P. Hunting- '

will be a consolidation of the New York I

union the Vanderbiits will extend from
Ogden on the Union Pacific system di
rectly to San Francisco. It is well known *
that the Vanderbiits have been trying for I

KILLED IN AN ELEVATOR.
Joseph Bastheim of Cahn, Nick=
elsburg & Co. the Victim of
a Terrible Accident.
JOSEPH BASTHEIM, a member of the wholesale shoe firm of Cahn.
Nickels burg & Co., met a fearful death yesterday morning by being
crushed In the freight elevator on the firm's premises at 123 Sansome
street. Mr. Bastheim arrived at 3 o'clock, his usual time, at the store,
and walked to the office in the rear part, where he found John Bowen, a
clerk. He complained of dizziness, and Bowen went on the elevator and rode
to the sixth floor and opened the fire traps for the admission of fresh air.
He returned to the office, and Mr. Bastheim went on the elevator for the
purpose of following his usual custom of going to the roof to make observa
tions on the state of the weather."* Mr. Bowen was attending to his duties in
the store, and did not suspect anything was wrong until after a quarter of
an hour had elapsed, and one of the other employes came in. When the em
ploye tried to atari the elevator to bring it down he found the wire rope
would not work, by reason of being caught. Mr. Bowen and Mr. Cahn pro
ceeded to the fourth floor by way of the stairs, and were horrified to find the
dead body of Mr. Bastheim jammed between the floor of the elevator and the
ceiling. The head and the right shoulder of the dead man were hanging down
below the ceiling, while the remainder of his body was concealed by the
floor of the elevator.
Coroner Hill and Deputy McCormlck were summoned by telephone, and
hastened to the scene. They were obliged to cut away a portion of the ceil
ing md to work about fifteen minutes before they succeeded in extricating
the mangled remains.
Th- only theory of the accident that seems plausible is that the deceased
was overtaken with one of the dizzy spells of which he had been complaining
and fell to .the floor of the elevator, with his head hanging out of the side.
The elevator baa no walls, being used for freight, and consists merely of a
platform and the hoisting gear, and when it reached the ceiling it jammed ths
unconscious man against the ceiling and stopped.
Mr. Bastheim had been in the wholesale shoe business in this city for the
past thirty years. He was a native of Germany and 12 years old. He leaves
a widow, three sons and two daughters. One of his daughters is Mrs. Louis
Frankenheim of Stockton and the other Mrs. W. Lubin of Los Angeles. The
eldest son. Arthur, is a clerk in the store, and Edward and Robert are at
tending school. â 
GOES TO THE CREDITORS.
The Widow of A. Pag. Brown Can
not Keep His Insurance Policy.
By a decision of the Supreme Court yes- j
terday the bulk of the estate of the late j
A. Page Brown will go to his creditors.
The estate was valued at about $43,370,
of which $25,000 was In the form of a life \
insurance policy, taken out for the bene
fit of the widow, Lucy P. Brown, and the
three minor children. The lower court 1
evtdently considered the policy as a part
of the estate subject to confiscation on I
behalf of the creditors of the deceased.
Mrs. Brown took the matter to the higher !
court, claiming that the insurance pol
icy was separate from the estate under :
the law which exempts "all moneys, ben- i
efits, privileges or Immunities accruing or
in any manner growing out of any life
Insurance on the life of the debtor, if
the annual premiums paid do not exceed
The Supreme Court holds that the
amount of the ___ of deceased was
in excess of $500. and if those who framed
this law intended that this clause should ;
apply to a larger sum they would have
said so, and not left the matter In doubt. |

els, against 188,083,471 bushels in 1897 and 131.-

$89,605, consisting of $21,205 In Mexican dollars,

THE HOP MARKET.
The New York Commercial says of Hops:
"The situation of the hop market is an in
teresting one. It is said that out of 135.000
bales on the Pacific Coast less than 10,000 are
In brewers' hands and it will be eight months
before the new crop comes into the market. It
is also said that New York State hops are of
inferior quality and have not found as ready a
pale as Pacifies. Out of 75,000 bales of hops
growing in New York State there are still 30,000
unsold in first hands. Choice New York State
hops will probably bring lSVic per pound In
New York, while some of the very common
grades can be bought at about He. The Pa
cific Coast hops range in price from 12g19c per
pound, according to quality.
"Exports to Europe have been exceedingly
large, amounting to about 75,000 bales since
(September, equal to one-third of the entire
United States crop of UK. â¢
"The trade with brewers has been rather
dull, most of them complaining of poor busi
ness owing to the increased revenue tax on
beer, and it is estimated that the loss in busi
ness from July to December was about 10 per
cent, as compared with the same period in
1897. Dealers believe that brewers will soon
be in the market for hops and that prices will
be higher in the near future."
" NO PRUNE COMBINE LIKELY."
Under the above head the New York Com
mercial says: "Some of the leading dealers in
prunes were shown the statement ln yester
day's Commercial concerning the possibility of
a combination of prune growers and driers in
California.
"W. H. Dudley of W. H. Dudley A Co.
said: 'No such combination can be formed
The growers are too scattered. It might be
possible to organize a few around Fresno or
6ome other shipping point, but it would be out
of the question for them all to agree.'
"Other dealers expressed substantially the
same opinion, pointing out the impossibility of
successfully organizing _uch a scattered Inter
est. - ,
"According to recent reports from the coast
the bulk of prunes of all sizes left in first
hands will not exceed 500 cars, and these are
principally Santa Clara goods. The estimate
of the yield of the Santa Clara Valley has
been reduced' from 50,000,000 to 40,000,000 pounds.
"Dealers say that seldom at this time of
the year is the market In all positions so strong.
All large sizes in California were taken for
export. Demand must be supplied from the
medium and small sizes. Prices are firmer and
tend upward on all sizes."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 25.â There were gains of 1
to 11% points in stocks to-day on transactions
in excess of a million shares, which were
widely distributed, many usually neglected
shares figuring in the total. The market here
opened hesitatingly in sympathy with the Ir
regularity in London, which was a seller of
some 20,000 shares in the first hour. The effect
of this selling was but slight, owing to the sup-
port given by leading interests. The profes
sional element relieved the pressure which it
had been exerting on the market and turned
buyers. The commission business was in fair
volume and was disposed to allow advances
wherever they occurred. London took back
some of her earlier Bales on noting the im
proved tendency here. Influences bearing on
the situation were the handsome increases in
gross earnings for the third week in January
shown by St. Paul, Missouri Pacific and Cana
dian Pacific. There were a number of very
interesting features In the market after the
first hour. Metropolitan Street Railway
started a sensational advance, which eventually
reached 11% points above last night's closing.
Manhattan sympathetically made an extreme
gain of 3 points. These movements led to a re
vival of rumors that the relations of the two
companies had been placed on a more har
monious basis. New York Central made a gain
? f V Northwest 314 and P. C. C. and St.
Louis 7%. Union Pacific preferred made a rise
0f. 3% on revival of the belief in the so-called
Vanderbilt transcontinental deal, while Lake
Erie and Western preferred was up 6% points
on the idea that the road was being acquired
in the interest of the New York Central. The
interest switched then into the low-priced
shares, and rises of about 3 points occurred in
Rubber, Chesapeake and Ohio, Pacific Mall
Canada Southern, Chicago and Great Western
and Rio Grande Western preferred, while the
extreme advance in Toledo and Ohio Central
Rio Grande and Western common and Ten
nessee Coal and Iron reached 5 points The
strength of the rubber stocks was on dividend
gossip, that of Pacific Mall on reports from
Washington as to the disposition to subsidize
American shipping. New York Airbrake
bounded up 6 points. The closing was firm
well up to the top figure. V
The bond market developed marked strength
as the day progressed and closed active at
about the best. Total sales, $5,960,000. - Gov
ernment bonds were unchanged on bid price

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, Jan. 25.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were active to-day, consid
ering the settlement. The tone was good, ex
cept in Americans. Â...; 'J â¢"â ;. y ;
Africans continue buoyant, diverting atten
tion from Americans. The latter had a dull
opening under a steady pressure of selling or
ders. Jobbers refused to buy. There was a
lull in the . early afternoon on the exhaustion
of. sales arid some preliminary buying before
New York's opening, which caused a rally, ad
vancing Union Pacific Issues, Ontario and West- |
crn and Baltimore and Ohio. The close was !
feverish, with a Bagging tendency predominat- I
Ing.
The public made large deliveries at the set- I
[ tlement, showing no disposition to lock up
capital, but only to scalp dollar profits. The
general contango rate was about 4; for Atch
ison preferred it was lighter.
Tlntos were 36%; Anacondas, 7%. . --,':-

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. j /
CHICAGO, Jan. . 25.â The .early, . Llvt spool
cables stated that market was making* but
little . resistance to - the advance here yester
day, and this put . something of a damper on
bull enthusiasm at the - start ln wheat. May
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1899.
opened %Â®%c lower at 72%Â®73c and . it sank
I slowly to 72% c. At that point, however. , Wall
| street bulls sent buying ' orders and the price
I soon Jumped , to . 73% c. The ... comparatively .
j heavy receipts were aa little regarded as the
1 unsympathetic character of the Liverpool mar
. ket. The bulls in wheat, paraphrasing a well
known rhyme, altered to apply to present con
; ditions 'of heavy , receipts, were individually
saying: ' â¢-â¢â¢ :^ -,-â¢--..4
"What care I how much they be '...:;
While Wall-street buyers stick to me."
With that refrain in mind and the desired
; evidence that New York buying orders could
; still be relied on they hoisted May wheat to
I 73% c before the session was two hours old.
j A report was current about half an hour from
i the close that 120 boatloads of wheat had been
i taken at the seaboard for export and May
I sold as high as 74c, but reacted %c on some
! profit taking. The price slid back to 73% con
! a contradiction of the report, but again ad
vanced on â¢ heavy buying, evidently from Wall
street. May sold up to 75c and was bringing
that price when the bell tapped.
Corn received a good speculative support
' and was strong in the main after a short
! period of weakness at the i start. The mar
i ket was influenced by the bullishness of wheat
I and made its best price near the close. May
left off %c higher.
Oats were strong from the start and more
independent than usual. May gained %Â®%c.
Gooc foreign demand for provisions. Including
lard, was offset by heavy receipts of hogs. A
disposition on the part of the holders to sell
was manifested, but strength of grains did no
more for the market than to cause the early
lose to be all regained. The close was about
unchanged from yesterday. .V

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Jan. 25.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: ,
The demand for wool is still quiet. Manu
facturers are not buying liberally. The cloth
ing trade is holding off from purchasing and
will continue to hold off as long as it thinks
that it is for its advantage to do so. The re
markably strong position of the market abroad
has very materially stiffened the ideas of
holders of wool here, especially quarterblood
stock, and prices are really firmer than they
have been for some months. .-.
There has been more activity in Texas wools
the past week, the transactions of the week
aggregating about 275,000 pounds. Territory
wools have been in fair demand, whereas but
little business was reported in pulled wools.
The sales of the week in the Boston market
amount to 2,869,000 pounds domestic and 655,000
pounds foreign, making a total of - 3,554,000
pounds, against a total of 2,885,500 for the pre
vious week.
LONDON WOOL MARKET.
LONDON, Jan. 25.â At the wool auction sales
to-day 15,421 bales were offered. A good selec

largely by the American representatives, their
purchases for the series so far reaching 4000
bales. Good merinos were briskly bid for the
home trade. Several parcels of greasy merinos
were taken for Russia at full rates. The at
tendance was unusually large.

A HOT TIME IN
THIS OLD TOWN
Noted Klondikers Are
in San Francisco.
BROUGHT THE BABIED ALONG
THE DISCOVERERS OF THE GOLD
FIELDS HIT THE CITY.
Party Includes "Skookum Jim,"
"Tagish Charlie" and George
Carmuc, Who Turned the
First Pan on Bonanza.
The most distinguished coterie of
Klondikers who ever visited this city
are now engaged in the practice of
burning up their good money in an en
deavor to paint the town a bright car
mine hue.
"Tagish" Charlie, "Skookum" Jim
and George Carmuc, whose discovery
of the rich gold fields of Klondike made
their names a watchword all over the
civilized world, slipped into town unan
nounced last Tuesday night and reg
istered like most of the Klondikers, at
the Commercial Hotel.
The two gentlemen with the odd so
briquets are Alaskan Indians and are
accompanied by their wives and fami
lies, consisting in each case of two or
three fat, bronzed-faced natives of the
frozen north, the oldest of the children
being scarcely 5 years of age.
The two Indians were with George
Carmuc when he made the famous dis
covery on Bonanza Creek and they
share with him In the fortunes of the
discovery. Carmuc after making the
find which placed him among the list
of the millionaires of the world. Imme
diately staked out his discovery claim
and another one next to it. These
claims are known as Discovery and
No. 1 below Discovery. "Skookum" Jim
and "Tagish" Charlie, though native
Indians, were not slow to realize that
their partner had made a rich find, so
they, too, staked out adjoining claims.
Their claims are registered as No. 2
and 3 below Discovery. It is estimated
that between the three they have at
least enough money to buy half of the
city of San Francisco. At any rate
the trio have taken more gold out of
their claims than any other individual
or set of Individuals on the Klondike.
This is their first visit to civilization
since they made the discovery that sent
thousands of people flocking to the
Klondike from all parts of the civilized
world, some to reap untold wealth and
others to reap the harvest of death.
"Tagish" Charlie. "Skookum" Jim
and Carmuc intend to remain in the
city for some time. They are infatuat
ed with the town, ana have spent all
of their time since their arrival In
sightseeing.
The odd dress and manners of the
party have attracted great attention
wherever they go. Along Market street'
yesterday afternoon . the -pudgy little
Indian children and their mothers were
the cynosure of all eyes. They intend
to visit every pleasure resort in;, the
city. They came here to enjoy -them
selves, and they do not intend to let the
mere matter of a thousand or two stand
In the way of their amusement.
ELECTRO MAGNETIC WAVES.
Subject of an Interesting Lecture by
Rev. R. IL Bell.
"Hertzian Waves and Their Applica
tion to Wireless Telegraphy" was â . the
subject of an intensely Interesting and
able lecture by the Rev. R. H. Bell. S. J.,
last evening at St. Ignatius College Hall.
In addition to a verbal discussion of the
theories of nearly all the greatest scien
tists of the century, a practical illustra
tion and test was given by means of the
latest improved electrical apparatus. The
phenomena of light, electricity and mag
netic force were expounded fully and
many Interesting, Instructive and success
ful experiments made. The lecture, as
divided Into its various parts for separate
and distinct discussion, Is as follows: â¢
Preliminary Notionsâ Faraday-Maxwell The
ory of Light; ratio of electrostatic to electro
magnetic unit, a velocity; oscillatory nature of
the electric spark. Schiller's experiment ex
plained; Hertz's oscillators; Hertz's experi
ments in relation to the velocity of electro
magnetic waves, with mathematical explana
tion; electro-magnetic reflection; wavelength
of electro-magnetic waves; application of
Hertzian theory to wireless telegraphy; Mar
coni's apparatus; telegraphing by means of the
apparatus; telegraphing without the use of
Marconi's coherer. ,'. '. 'â¢â _.*, Â£,"â >; â .
In conjunction with the lecture the fol
lowing musical programme was ren
dered by the college orchestra: "La
Czarina" (Ganne); "The Last Hope"
(Gottschalk); "La Serenata" (Jaxone);
"Queen Flora March" (Meyer). .; ,-".-"
Three Years for Irwin.
Charles Irwin, alias Ring, was sentenced
yesterday to three years' imprisonment in
the San Quentin Penitentiary for coun
terfeiting. United States District Judge
de Haven made the sentence comparative
ly light on the intercession of Secret Ser
vice Agent Brown and the fact that Irwin
had saved the Government the expense of
a trial by pleading guilty, and the fur
ther fact that the prisoner Is 72 years old
and might not survive a longer term of
confinement. , - â¢ - - %-%i

The most valuable food will not long
agree with a person if its taste is dis-
â¢ agreeable. This does not argue that
all nice tasting articles are nutritious
.and nourishing. However, -it is the
duty of all food experts to produce de-

sive knowledge of the laws of diges-

TRYING TO FIX THE BLAME
INSPECTORS OF STEAM VES
SELS TAKING EVIDENCE.
â¢
An Eye- Witness to the Collision
Throws Some New Light
on the Dreadful
Disaster.
Another chapter to the disastrous col
i lision on the bay between the Oakland
1 and the gasoline launch William D, which
' resulted In the loss of two lives, was
! added yesterday, when the United
! States Local Inspectors of Steam
' Vessels took testimony with a view to
! fixing the responsibility 'or the accident.
The testimony adduced at the hearing
was strongly against the officers of the
; ferry-boat, and unless new witnesses come
forward in their behalf they are likely
! to suffer the loss of their licenses or a
j heavy penalty. _&â¢â Â£ 2'yry
i The examination was conducted by Cap
tain O. F. Bolles and Captain J. K. Bul
| ger. Eight witnesses were called, but the
testimony of J. J. Flaherty, a deckhand
on the United States survey steamer
McArthur, was the weightiest, he having
witnessed the collision and the movements
j of both boats up to the time it occurred.
Flaherty testified that he was on deck
' filling water tanks, and saw the gasoline
! launch coming up under the bows of the
McArthur, followed by the Oakland and
! overtaken.
"When I first saw the boats," the "wit
ness said, "the ferry-boat was overtaking
the launch. The collision took placo about
three or four hundred yards from the Mc-
Arthur. As soon as it occurred I re
ported to the quartermaster, and we got
out our launch and went to their rescue."
The witness further stated that he was
positive he heard no whistles blown, and
his assertion is borne out by those who
were on the launch.
W. Clairville, the captain of the Oak
land, was the first witness called. At
the outset he made the following state
ment: "We left the slip at 8:0.. 1 was
in the pilot house with Pilot Douglass.
Douglass came in after the steamer had
cleared the slip and relieved me at the
wheel. About Â»*) yards from the slip he
called my attention to something right
abeam and said, 'What is that fellow
trying to do?' 1 looked out of the win
dow as he blew the danger signal, stopped
and backed the steamer. 1 then saw a
launch right down forward of the wheel,
under the pilot house. I Immediately went
to the other end of the boat and found
that our lifeboat had been put off to the
, launch and was picking up her men."
He also stated that it was a customary
, rule of the railroad company to station
I a lookout forward, whose duty it was to
1 report vessels crossing the steamer's
bows. He admitted that in this instance
no report was made. Captain Clairville
contended that the launch left Folsom
street after the Oakland had begun her
trip. --v
First Officer J. H. Douglass corrobor
ated his superior officer and also de
scribed the position of the two boats be
fore and after the collision. * ' â r
Lars H. Gustafson, who was in charge
of the William. D on the fatal trip, gave
a clear account of the sinking of his
boat. In part he said: "After leaving
i the wharf 1 was told to head toward West
\ Berkeley. I steered my course . to the
: west side of Goat Island. We were trav
j cling at about six or seven miles an Hour.
The first knowledge I had of danger was
| a warning to look out. I grasped hold
; of the window sill to see what was wrong,
j and as I did we were struck. The water
> came rushing In and I jumped. When I
came up I found myself forty feet from
, the launch and 200 feet from the Terry
; boat. I saw a man struggling in the
water and tried to reach him, but failed.
â¢ I was picked up by the lifeboat."
Gustafson also stated that he could see
all around and stated that the noise of
â  the William D's machinery would not pre
â¢ vent him hearing the paddle wheels or
the whistle of the Oakland. He was pos
itive no whistle was sounded.
Ben Hansen, a deckhand on the Oak
land, said he was in the forward part of
â  the boat when he heard a short blast and
on looking forward saw the launch abeam
on the Oakland. He admitted being on
â¢ duty as lookout, but stated that he was
going to his post when tne crash came.
Charles C. Finn, a brother of one of
! the missing Berkeley boys for whom
those on board the William D were search
ing, testified that he saw the Oakland
leave her slip. He said he and Mr. Orr
' were standing aft, and when he saw the
i Oakland bearing down on the launch he
i warned those in the cabin. He was un
! able to state what distance intervened be
-1 tween the two boats when the Oakland
I left her slip, but gave as his judgment
; that it was about a block. He described
1 how he was thrown into the water and
: of his being picked up. Young Finn was
i unable to give the relative positions of
] the boats at the time of the accident. He
| was also positive that no whistle was
; blown by those on board the Oakland.
J. H. Matthews, who was a passenger
on the 111 fated craft, corroborated Finn
' on material points. He said there was no
i warning until the collision actually took
place.
William Carson, a steamboat man. was
, called and gave the only testimony in fa
vor of Captain Clairville and First Offi
i cer Douglass. He said he was standing
j on the after lower deck when he heard
! a short whistle. He paid no attention un-
I til he heard four bells, when he stepped
to the rail and saw the gasoline launch
I just twenty-five feet off.
Henry Peterson, the owner of the
sunken boat, informed the examining
board that he had a number of witnesses
who were passengers on tEe ferry-boat at
the time of the collision and who would
testify that no whistle was blown.
The commander of the Oakland and his
first officer also stated that they had a
material witness who would testify in
their behalf and asked to be allowed to
produce him.
The request of both sides was granted,
< and a postponement was taken until Fri
day at 1 o'clock, when further testi
mony will be heard.

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. JANUARY 26; ; 1899,
THE FOOTBALL
PLAYER IS HERE
Douglas Tilden's Famous
Statue on Exhibition at
the Art Institute.
DOUGLAS TILDEN'S famous statue, "The Football Player," Is
here. It- is on exhibition at the Art Institute and Secretary Mar
tin, with his usual regard for the public pleasure, has had it
placed where all may enjoy the rare work of art.
On the first landing, at the head of the first flight of - stone steps
that leads to the Institute, resting on a rude though substantial ped
estal, "The Football Player" will challenge the admiration of all. The
placing is excellent.- The strong light beats' down on all sides, showing
â with impartiality all' the .points of the magnificent ' anatomy of the
bronze athlete. V '*'' '' ' ; '..;'â } ' ' ': '";''' "' â .-.'""'*" ''..-
In his "Football Player" Tilderi has sacrificed the real to the Ideal
and has clothed' his man in a garb that is a cross between a bathing
suit and a golf costume. If . it were not for the ball, and the football
bang the artist might have called his latest work by any other name
and have had it sound as well. i;-' 1~ - ..-/..'
"The Football Player,"" which is the property of James D. Phelan,
Is to be presented by the Mayor to the universityâ University of Cali
fornia or Stanford Universityâ will win two out of the series of
three football games, the first of which was played on last Thanksgiv
ing day. yy.y .;,;. 2...::y~2y
Until the award is made the Mayor has arranged that the statue
shall be on exhibition at the- Art Institute.
This is the fourth piece of the great sculptor's work to find a place
in his native State. One statue, "The Tired Boxer," is the property of
the Olympic Club, "The Baseball Player" is at the Park and "The Bear
Hunt" ornaments the grounds of the Deaf and Dumb Institute at Berke
ley, where the distinguished sculptor was educated. .
SEEKING A MOTIVE
FOR KENNEDY'S MURDER
PROSECUTION ENDEAVORING TO
PROVE JEALOUSY.
The Murdered Policeman Was En
gaged to Be Married to an
Estimable Young
Lady.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Elizabeth Regan, charged with the mur
der of Policeman Thomas H. Kennedy,
was continued before Judge Graham yes
terday afternoon. The courtroom was
crowded and interest - centered in Miss
Gertrude Sohrman, 236 Clinton Park, the
young lady who was engaged to be mar
ried to Kennedy.
The witnesses examined were. Dr. T.
R. Roache, Mrs. Victoria Wagner, Cap
tain Glllen, J. W. Bird, Detective John A.
Fitzgerald, Policemen M. Anderson,
Thomas Finnelly and John Carson, De
tective R. F. Graham and Gertrude Sohr
man. y-'yy " y.yy . â  TV - y "â â â  â¢
Mrs. Wagner's testimony "was as to an
alleged conversation she had with Mrs.
Regan three months ago, when Mrs. Re
gan told her that she had found Miss
Sohrman's photograph in Kennedy's pos
session and had torn It in pieces. She was
I not sure about the conversation. Captain
; Gillen testified that Mrs. Wagner had told
i him of the conversation a few days ago.
i Policemen Finnelly and Carson testified
! as to Kennedy telling them of his engage
! ment- to a young lady. Carson also tes
tified that Kennedy had his gold watch
â  with him when they parted on the morn-
I ing of the shooting. . There was nothing
S new in the evidence of Fitzgerald and
Graham. ._â¢â¢â¢â¢
Miss Sohrman testified that she had
known Kennedy since February, 1697, and
was engaged to be married to him at the
time â¢of his death. During the past six
months he used to call at her mother's
house every day. The last time she was
out with .him was on New Year's eve.
Kenned told her that Mrs. Johnston,
one of Mrs. Regan's sisters, had seen
them. - She had never seen Mrs. Regan to
her knowledge, but one night when Ken
nedy parted from her at the gate he ex
claimed. "There she is." The witness
asked, "Who?" and he replied, "Brick,"
that being the name he always gave Mrs.
Regan from her red hair. After he left
her she looked out of the window and saw
the woman following Kennedy. The
woman resembled Mrs. Regan.
A question as to whether she knew that
Kennedy was In fear of Mrs. Regan was
being argued when court adjourned. The
case will be continued to-morrow morn
ing. â  ' 'â ' ' _â¢-_â _â¢â  â â¢-

ALL OVER THE MATTER. OF.
APPROPRIATIONS. ' â¢
Each Member Is Fighting for the
Money Allotted to His Respec
. tive District for Proposed
Improvements.
Dr. E. L. Perrault, chairman of the Fi
nance Committee of the Board of Super
visors, objects to being called a "re-
I former." y ~- .?- r ."r-V: 2y : i\y
I This name was applied to him on Tues
day by John Lackmann, one of his col
j leagues on the board. Lackmann claimed
;ln effect that the medical gentleman in
! recommending- the holding over of pro
posed expenditures amounting to $84,000
was playing to the gallery, and that the
board would not sustain him In the move
he was making. .
"I am not a reformer, nor have' I any
intention of becoming one," said Dr. Per
rault yesterday. "We found the city In
cumbered with a heavy indebtedness when
we assumed the duties of our office. Now
we want to so administer the affairs of
the city that when we retire the finan
cial tangle may be entirely unraveled. I
have not questioned for one moment the
necessity of these appropriations except
the one item of J6SOO for a system of fil
ters In the City Hall. .-.
"We are placed In the position of a bus
iness man who must economize ln order to
tide over a financial storm. We have only
the good of the city at heart and want to
do what is right for our constituents. â¢
' "I objected to, the employment of twen
ty-five additional policemen, a scheme
vigorously advocated by Mr. Lackmann.
I think in our present financial straits we
can get along with the force of men now
policing the city." . :y'~~
Supervisor Perrault gave a ' written
statement to the press yesterday in which
he says his only ambition Is to make a
good and -faithful public officer,, without
I the hope of any future reward in the j

he will not be a candidate for any further

PUNCH WAS A
BIT TOO STRONG
FOR THE LADIES
Young Society Buds in
Disgrace.
ONE FELL ON THE FLOOR
MATRONS MAY DECIDE ON PINK
LEMONADE.
Oakland's Swell Set Paces a Problem
That Has Been Suddenly and
Forcibly Brought Be-
V i ' > fore It.
â J*. Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 25.
Society Is shockedâ lt is alarmed. The
chaperons and matrons have discovered
that the younger .set Is in grave danger
from punch, read champagne punch.
There is evidence -that there is need of a
drastic retorm in tl:..s direction, and it has
already been started.
Not long ago in fact very recentlyâ a
young lady living on this side of Lake
Merrltt was induced at a ball to partake
bo freely of the punch that it became nec
essary to assist her home. In fact, it is
stated that she positively fell In the ball
room. It would he unjust to mention
names of the culprits or victims in this
connection, because they all assert inno
cence and declare that, if they had only
known how the pun<_i was constituted
nothing in the world could have per
suaded them to drink anything but pink
lemonade.
The particular Instance that has set
society gossiping __ the chaperons on
the anxious seat Is not tlie only one of
Its kind. ' Not long ago at a fashionable
Wedding one of the young ladies was so
generously served by an attending waiter
with champagne that she required assist
ance from the table. ,
Again, within a y*-,tr, at a function In
classic Berkeley, another > .ung lady was
overcome through Ignorance of the na
ture of punch, and in this instance, it Is
recorded that a coupe was hastily sum
moned to hide the evidence of the little
scandal.
Now the question is being debated as
to whether the crusade which has been
rendered imperative In local society shall
take the form of educating the young la
dies into a knowledge of how much each
can safely drink, or whether the attrac
tive punchbowl shall be abolished alto
gether. - ; ;.-
One of Oakland's best known women,
after extracting a promise that her name
should not be made public, said this af- j
ternoon: "It is an unhappy fact that I
there have been a few mistakes made ,
during the past season. The girls cannot i
be expected to know the strong qualities |
of punch, and I think that such a bever
age should not appear at a young folks' j
gathering. The matrons are giving this
matter much discussion, because they re
alize that some ride must Be established. ]
It would be very cruel and unfair to give
to the world the identity of the very few
who have been the victims of an unfortu- j
nate mistake. Perhaps it is true that ]
punch is served more frequently than in
past seasons, and this may account for tne
fact that the subject has been made prom-^
Inent at this time. However, I think in
future the liquids at young folks' gather
ings will be restricted to tea, coffee, Ice
cream soda and pink lemonade."
Just how this decision will be received :
by the younger element of society remains
to be seen.
CONTRACT WITH CHINESE
FOR HOP TENDING
AN INTERESTING PAPER IS PUT
ON RECORD.
They Must Cultivate Hops for Less
>';â _}'.;â /â  Than Twenty Cents a
7-l:l:\ Day.
â¢ i Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
MM Broadway. Jan. 25.
A contract was recorded to-day which
shows why it Is practically impossible for
white laborers to obtain work in the hop
fields prior to the harvest.
No white people, unless working for the
smallest pittance, and boarding on the
co-operative plan, could possibly give the
time and labor necessary to the hop .yards
for the amount paid by the growers.
Four thousand roots have to be staked,
tended, tied up, clipped, pruned and
watched for nearly six months for $15.
The contract is between the Pleasanton
Hop Company and the Sun Ling Company
of San Francisco, and the Chinese agree
to furnish all the men desired to tend,
raise and care for all the hops of the
Pleasanton Company. Everything is to
be done by the Chinese as soon as neces
sary and the work is to be kept up until
the harvest next August.
The contract is very explicit and its
terms show how great a quantity of work
is to be done. The laborers have "to
cut and save all extra roots, to place
from three to five roots In every missing
hill, pressing the soil firmly around the
roots planted,' picking out all grass and
weeds and covering the roots with fine
loam, free from all clods, and to cover and
uncover hills as often as the hop com
pany shall desire.
. The Chinese must gather up all stakes
and tie up all strings in the trellis, "must
put six men on the top of a wagon to
tie strings and also sufficient men on the
ground below to keep all . strings tied at
the bottom as fast as they are tied at
the top." There is also a penalty to all
this. â¢ â  - . â 
The contract concludes: "All the work
to be done In a farmlike manner under
the control of the company, and if it
should deem â¢ the work is not properly
done, either in a farmlike manner or with
sufficient force, it may put other men to
work and deduct the cost due the Chinese
under this contract."
For ail this labor, extending from
spring to September, or until the hops
are ready to be harvested, the hop com
pany agrees to pay $15 for an acre. There
are 1000 hills to an acre, and each hill
averages four roots.
A member of a local trades union has
computed that under this contract a good
Chinese laborer can earn about 21 cents
a day for the season.

POISON LURKED
IN THE INNOCENT
HOMINY PACKAGE
Mrs. Morton and Her
Family Suffer.
BROUGHT NEAR TO DEATH
HEROIC WORK OF MRS. ASHLEY
SAVED THEM.
The Hominy Was Bought of a Ped
dler and Is Believed to Have
Been Improperly Manu
factured.
OAKLAND, Jan. 25.â North Oakland
was greatly excited to-day over the al
most fatal poisoning of a mother and
three children. All sorts of plots were
exploited, and Indignation ran high when
It was reported that the victims had been
poisoned by some malicious enemy. The
matter was reported to the authorities,
and it was discovered that the poison was
contained ln some hominy that had been
bought from a peddler. ,
The family who narrowly escaped death
are Mrs. Minnie May Morton of oH
Thirty-sixth street and three of her chil
drenâClaude, aged 19 years; Minnie, aged
6 and a four-year-old baby. Two other
daughters, Cleo and Grace, aged 9 and 12
years respectively, happened to be away
from home at the time or-tÃey, too, would
have shared a similar fate.
That Mrs. Morton and the three first
named children are living to-day to relate
I their awful experience is wholly due to
, the efforts of Mrs. M. E. Ashley, a neigh
! bor, whose knowledge of medicine came
i well in hand at the most opportune mo
! ment. Last Monday Mrs. Morton pur
! chased a quart of hominy from a peddler
: named Shaln, who â  has a stand at tne
, Free" Market. â â¢ /
The food was served up at supper and
; nothing, further was thought of it until
j yesterday morning at 4 o'clock, when
Mrs. Morton and the three children awoke
suffering excruciating pains. For several
hours the unfortunates groaned Iri their
agony. Shortly after 7 o'clock the 6-year
old daughter, Minnie, managed to sum
mon up strength enough to call on Mrs.
Ashley for help. Mrs.* Ashley responded
promptly. She found Mrs. Morton In a
semi-comatose condition, and barely able
to inform her that the family had been
poisoned. ,' V >-
Without thinking of summoning a phy
sician Mrs. Ashley set. to work in her at
tempt to save the lives of her neighbors.
She Is a nurse and masseur by profession,
a fact that proved most fortunate in the
present case. Mrs. Ashley promptly ap
plied warm emetics, but several hours
passed and several doses were adminis
tered before the desired effect was accom- I
plished. The nurse worked industriously
over her patients until after 3 o'clock in
the afternoon. While Mrs. Morton and '
her children are considered practically
out of danger, they are still very weak
and were able to-day to take but little
nourishment. Mrs. Morton, when seen to
night by a Call reporter, said:
"We had a very narrow escape, but I
am thankful to Mrs. Ashley, for she cer
i tainly saved our lives. When I served the
L hominy for supper last Monday night 1
* noticed that It was not of the usual snow
j flaky appearance, and - each grain con
tained a black and blue spot; but I
thought it was all right, and paid no
' further attention to It until I awoke yes
terday morning suffering so terribly that
1 became dazed. I know it was the hom
iny that poisoned us, for I had eaten noth
ing else at supper, not even bread and
butter. Mr. Sham, the man who sold the
stuff, heard about our poisoning to-day,
and was very much alarmed. He called
on us and promised faithfully never to sell
any more. He Intimated that he thought
there was something the matter with the
hominy when he delivered It. The maize
is soaked or boiled in concentrated lye
while being prepared for the market, and
this was not properly cleansed; and par
! ticles of the hulls still clung to the grains.
Probably through some chemical action
the poison was formed."
Mrs. Ashley was also questioned by The
Call reporter, and though she was very
loth to make any stataement for publica
tion, she frankly corroborated Mrs. Mor
ton's story. She said:
"My husband had just opened his gro
cery store for the day, when little Min
nie called to me to come over, as they
believed the family was poisoned. I found
Mrs. Morton with her knees doubled up
to her chin. I worked over the poisoned
family from about 7:30 until 3 o'clock in
the afternoon, and I feel as happy over
saving their lives as they do themselves.
Fortunately Mrs. j Morton saved about a
saucerf ul of the poisonous hominy, " and
it is. as she says, black and blue in small
spots. We did not have it analyzed and
we did not call ln a doctor, because If we
had we knew that the whole affair would
get into the papers."
Mrs. Morton is a machine operator and
her husband is a traveling salesman, but
the couple have lived apart for some time.

HIS DEATH CAUSED
BY A GRAPE SEED.
OAKLAND, Jan. 25.â The death of Bernhard familiarly known
as "Count" Schmidt, which occurred this morning at his 'home, , .55.

seed in one of his bronchial tubes. ;%" - ; - - :
"Count" Schmidt had been the dispenser. of liquids at Ned Thayer's sa
loon on Eighth street for the -past 'fourteen years, and held the respect of
all with whom he," came in contact. | He was always apparently the picture"
of health; and his death is a great blow to his family and a host of friends.
For several months past deceased complained of pains in his throat and
bronchial tubes,' which symptoms he credited to the: lodgment of a grape
seed in some of the bronchial tubes. The seed could not be located by; his
physicians, and j last Saturday, It was proposed , to ; use an.X â  ray. .; However,
on the same day â  there was a . turn or } the worse.*; '; His ] face ' became â¢. in

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1899.
NO ONE SHALL
LOOK INTO HIS
WIFE'S BOUDOIR
To Prevent It Doyle
Will Spend Money-
TALKS OF TEN thousand
ADVISED BY THE COUNCIL TO
PULL DOWN THE BLINDS. V
A Vigorous and Interesting Objec
tion to a Proposed Rail
y ;- -way Switch Sta
tion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
- . 90S Broadway, Jan. 25.
Luke Doyle registered a vow before the
City Council that he will spend $10,000 to
! prevent a tower man of the Southern Pa
i cific Railroad from looking into his wife's
i boudoir. Doyle is desperate. â¢ *v; i-i;.?- : i
The trouble arises from the necessity to
j protect life at Seventh and Webster
streets, where two steam tracks cross.
For many years the railroad company has
desired a Dig bay-window on one of the
corners for the purpose of operating a
derailing system. Since James Fair built
the narrow-gauge road and crossed the
broadgauge tracks there has been a sig
nal post operating a derailing switch in
the center of the street. This has worked
pretty well, but with the inauguration of
20-minute broadgauge trains and the cer
tainty that on many occasions an open
drawbridge will make irregular the trips
of the Webster street line, the company
realizes that the danger at Seventh and
Webster streets will be materially in
creased. 7v .;.-â â "â ' â '':-.. ';-"--..',â 
Some weeks ago they petitioned the
Council for permission to erect a bay-win
dow on one of the corners projecting over
the sidewalk from which a tower man
can look both ways and can operate an
Interlocking system accordingly. The
company claims that this is . absolutely
necessary to avoid catastrophes.
Mr. Doyle [ went before the Council
primed. His eloquence and his activity
are equal. "I am an American citizen,"
said he, "have lived here for many years,
pay lots of taxes, and I object to the rail
road company being permitted to erect a
tower in which the signal man can spend
all his spare time looking into my wife's
boudoir. No one can tell what inconven
ience this might cause. No one has any
right to gaze through my bedroom win
dows; and do you think I could get per
mission from your honorable body to
erect . a tower on some street corner so
as to be able to look through other peo
pie's windows? Not if I went to Sacra
mento or to Washington I couldn't get a
power of attorney to build a tower on the
street corner. But the railroad can, and
I guess they are the only people that
can." v.i'-'A:';
Several gentlemen of the Council sug
gested that if . Mr. â¢' Doyle and his wife
lived across the street it might |be ad
visable to pull down the blinds if the
tower man was unduly Inquisitive. Coun
cilman Earl also proposed that an extra
shade might be advisable. This brought
forth the forceful statement from Mr.
Doyle, who shouted, "You (Earl) live in
the Watts Tract,*' and followed this up
by hinting that there might be a differ
ence in etiquette between the Watts
Tract and Seventh and Webster streets.
When Mr. Doyle heard the vote an
nounced giving the railroad the desired
permission he turned on the Council and
with hands and voice raised he
shouted, "This is law in America, Is it?
I will spend $10,000 beating this before 1
will let em put a tower with a man in it
Who can look ln my bedroom windows."
MRS. LIPKA FILES A
NEW DIVORCE SUIT
- - - â r-Â» â | Â«
FIRST ATTEMPT FRUSTRATED
BY A REVOLVER.
Sophie Schoenfelder Finally Succeeds
in Securing â  a Legal Separa
tion. ;:v'i;,V
. Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 25.
Emily M. Lipka to-day filed a new com
plaint for a divorce from her husband,
Elkan M. Lipka, the Broadway pawn
broker, this time charging cruelty.
In Mrs. Lipka's first complaint infidelity
was charged, and a ,few days ago her
stalwart husband j created a scene at the
office of her attorney, D. Mitchell, by
threatening to shoot the latter, unless he
forthwith dismissed the . suit. ." His re
quest, which at the time was emphasized
by the brandishing of a six-shooter, was
complied with the next morning. In the
present suit Clinton Dodge appears as
Mrs. Lipka's attorney, and the trial prom
ises to prove decidedly interesting.
Sophia Schoenfelder has finally ob
tained a divorce from Herman J. Schoen
felder on the ground of infidelity. Judge
Ogden entered the decree to-day. Mrs.
Schoenfelder sued for a divorce on the
ground of cruelty several months ago. but
the court denied a decree at that time.
The custody of the minor children is
awarded to plaintiff and defendant Is or
dered to pay $25 monthly alimony for their
support. . * .' - - -
A divorce was also granted to-day by
Judge Ellsworth to Katherine A. Watson
from Walter E. Watson on the ground
of extreme cruelty. The care and cus
tody of the two minor children, Walter
E. and Arthur, L. Watson, Is awarded to
plaintiff, and permanent alimony is fixed
at $30 per month.

HEIRS OF MRS. PRYAL
ASK FOR A RECEIVER
SHE DEEDED HER ESTATE TO
HER ELDEST SON.
Her Plan to Save the Expense : of
Administration Brings on
Litigation r ' I,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 25.
A suit that promises to be very interest
ing was filed late this afternoon by James
A. and Charles L. Pryal against William
A., Ellen G., Mollie W., ( Eliza R. and A.D.
. Pryal, for the purpose of quieting title to
valuable income property, comprising sev
eral houses in this city. . _
The complaint recites that Mary A.
Pryal, mother of all the parties named,
died December 5, 1896, and that during the
August previous she was induced to de
liver to William A. Pryal her entire es
tate . without consideration, with the un
derstanding, however, . that he hold the
same in trust and at her death convey to
each of the heirs his and her respective
share.
3 William A. Pryal is the eldest son, an
attorney by profession and for. many
years Mrs. Pryal's confidential business
agent and legal adviser. The complaint
alleges "that by reason of this long and
confidential business relation he exercised
great influence over the mother, who
trusted him with the entire management I
of her estate,' and by -reason of such trust I
and confidence he was selected to carry |
out said trust In order to save the estate
the expense and delay of administration."
Her last wishes, however, have not been
carried out.vand plaintiffs ask that a re
ceiver be appointed and that the defend
ants' claim be declared a trust- for the
benefit of all the heirs. Ellen G., Mollie
W. and Eliza R. Pryal are joined as de
fendants, since they have interests and
have refused to join as plaintiffs.
BASEBALL BEGINS.
The Spring Term at the U. C. Starts
With Good Prospects..
BERKELEY, Jan. 25.â The baseball
men of the University of California
donned their suits this afternoon for the
first time this term, and came out for
an hour of field practice. The season
starts off with a fairly good number of
men. , Bride and Collins of last year's
team are not coming out this year. Meln,
Hunter, Kaarsberg, McLaren. Swan,
Cheeseborough and McCabe are left over
from last spring. - They will doubtless all
make the college, nine again this year,
leaving but one or two Vacancies to be
filled. Captain McLaren expects to insti
tute regular practice immediately. A
match will be arranged very soon be
tween the class of '99 and the U. C.
Dental College in San Francisco.
Out With a Knife.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 25.â Bay-street
Republican Club, which earned the dis
tinction during the last campaign of "poli
tical enigma of Alameda," was reorganized
last night for the purpose of trying to
make itself felt at the approaching muni
cipal election. The club enters the arena
armed with a knife. It has a grievance
against some of the city officials, and in
tends to make a big effort to cut short
their political life. The club will not
nominate an independent ticket, but will
pick its candidates from the selections
made by the Municipal League and the
Harmonle Hall party. 2.- rry..

SCHOOL BOARD'S
DRASTIC ACTION
â A Radical Revolution of the
Department in Line of j
Economy.
NORMAL STUDENTS WILL GRADUATE
All Teachers Appointed Since August Last
Dismissed â Twenty-four Classes
Consolidated â Several
Schools Closed.
The Board of Education at its meeting last night practically
revolutionized the School Department, making the most sweeping re
forms. All teachers employed since August 1, 1898, were dismissed,
as were all substitute and probationary teachers. The day substitute
list was reduced to thirty-five teachers and it will be made up of those
consolidated out of their classes. They will be selected by chronolog
ical order of appointment to the department and will be paid only for
services rendered.
Manual training was done away with, except in the Polytechnic
High School; cooking classes were abolished and the cooking teachers
were dismissed. The Superintendent of Schools was given increased power.
Classes were consolidated in twenty-four, schools.
The Normal School will remain open until June 1, but after Feb
ruary 1 the pupils must support it, paying all the expenses, including
salaries of teachers, janitor, rent and fuel.
Four evening schools were closed and classes _n others were con
solidated.
. After the meeting had been called to I
order and the minutes and comn.nica
tions had been read. Superintendent Web- j
ster created a decided sensation by mov- '
Ing that the board go into executive ses
sion. He said there were some proposi
tions to be submitted to the consideration '
of the board that were of such vital im
portance that they should be considered
ln executive session.
Director Stow immediately moved that
the board go into committee of the
whole. Before the question was called '
President Bergerot called Director Head j
to the chair. The latter put the question, j
which was carried, and the members of !
the board retired to their committee room.
It was all the world like a Jury retiring to i
deliberate upon a verdict in a case where
much devolved upon the Jury's decision. !
Long before the hour for the meeting l
the cheerless, dimly lighted corridors took I
on an animated appearance. Teachers I
whose positions were in Jeopardy, Normal ''
School pupils, with here and there an at- i
torney, made up the throng. Before the
meeting was called to order the various
Directors were buttonholed by commit
tees from improvement clubs and other
organizations who pleaded with them in
the interest of certain schools. The lobby

of the meeting room was packed to the
doors, and the overflow filled the adjoin
ing corridor. All through the long wait I
they maintained their places of van- ;
tage with commendable patience. ;
As the minutes were ticked off by the ,
clock the hum of animated conversation .
rose and fell. After a time the specta
tors began to vary the monotony by ap
plauding whenever Assistant Secretary
Charlie Berliner or some other official
moved about the meeting-place.
The followers of the Normal School
were jubilant before the meeting, as they
had assurances of seven votes for the res- ;
toration of the Normal School. Two Di
rectors had promised to present separate
resolutions having this end in view. The
pressure that had been brought to bear
upon the Directors since the last meeting i
had caused them to waver ln their deter- j
mination to close the school. Its support- i
ers awaited with interest the outcome of i
the executive session which meant so i
much to them.
The cause of the Mission High School I
was championed by Dr. C. A. Clinton, j
supported by many residents of the dis
trict he represents. The matter of Its !
abolition did not come before the board.
The Directors did not return from their \
secret deliberations until 11:05 p. m. The I
report of the committee of the whole was
then read. Preliminary to this the sub-
Joined resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That no act, decision or resolu

The committee on supplies reported that
an inventory had been taken of shop sup
plies and that the. stock in most all cases
was completely exhausted and there were
no tools for workmen to work with.

solidation .of . classes 'will bring about

The position of superintendent of con
struction of 1 Mission High School was de
clared vacant.

The City and County Attorney was in

The committee on buildings. and grounds
reported that â¢ the members found , the
school buildings and yards in a deplorable
and unsanitary condition and that imme
diate attention is demanded by the
Health Department.
Director Holbrook reported for ' the
Finance Committee. He said that nothing
could be done until' Judge Seawell decides
the school cases now pending before him.
If he sustains the twelfth act, the
board will have over $5u0,000 with which
to run the department for the ensuing six
months. .If he decides against it, the
board must pay the debts contracted by
the last board. This will leave it with
funds sufficient to conduct the department
for two and a half months.
The position of vocal , teacher in the
Girls' High. School was abolished and the
, teacher . dismissed.
.Director Head moved that the teachers
â¢ consolidated -out of the evening schools
be " placed on the unassigned list without
pay. .; Adopted.
After the committee reports were sub
mitted and the last bomb had been ex
ploded into - the crowd' of apprehensive
teachers the Normal School 'matter, came
up. The resolution modifying the board's
'action. of January. 11, and extending the
life of the Normal until the present class
is graduated, provoked the only debate In
the proceedings. The secretary read the
petition from the, pupils, in which they
asked to be allowed to graduate and se
cure Normal certificates, and stating they
would bear the -expense of maintaining
the school to the. end of the term. A sup
plemental petition, signed by thousands of
taxpayers who - asked the board to con
tinue the school on the plan suggested by
the scholars, â  was also presented.
i Dr. H. E. Gedge then offered a resolu
tion which provides that the Normal
School may be kept open by the attend
ants thereof until June 1 at no expense to
the Board of Education after February 1.
The opponents of the Normal sought to
defeat : the â¢ resolution by filibustering,
raising points, of order so. rapidly that
President Bergerot got mixed on his par
liamentary rulings. After ten minutes'
debate on these points of order, with no
reference to . the merits of the resolution,
it was finally passed by a vote of 7 to 5. .
: i The secretary* read a batch of communi
cations and protests, . which were referred
to the proper committees,' as follows:
; The- Sunnyside J. District- Improvement Club
petitioned '. for ; the. erection of a twelve-room
sohoolhouse In that 'district. ; ' â¢

One of the si ldiers is accompanied
by his wife. Sergeant John Glynn of
Company E was married two years
ago at Fort Leavenworth, and when
the regiment got orders to move she
decided to follow her husband.. She
crossed the continent with the soldier
boys and will sail -on the Scandia with
them. She is bright, active and good
looking, and will make the far-off
Philippines seem something like home
to her husband.
The Scandia has been made into a
model troopship during her stay in
port. She is now fitted with every
convenience, and since she has been
painted white she looks like one of the
white squadron. Captain Hart, of
course, goes out as commander, but
Chief Officer Crosky remains ashore.

merly captain of the ship J. B. Brown,
goes out as chief officer, and A. Gard
