NEW SOLDIERS
He Expects to Take the
Rebel Chief Aguinaldo
Prisoner.
Hale Drives the Insurgents From
the Front of His Position at
the Water Works.
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The War Department
expects important news from Manila within the next twenty
four hours. Word has been received from General Otis that
he will not wait for the arrival of Lawton and the troops on
the Grant and Sherman before he begins a general attack
upon the insurgents.
The advices say Otis will, either to-day or to-morrow,
make the contemplated advance upon the Filipinos with his
entire force. The arrival of the men on the transports Sena
tor and Ohio has given him enough reinforcements to hold
Manila while he uses the other troops for an aggressive cam
paign against the rebels.
It is expected in this attack Aguinaldo will be captured
and much done to end the insurrection in the island of
Luzon.

MANILA, March 7.â General Ha!" |
â¢ rmined this morning to
J\i J j IPs- a way. the onfliny _f rom in
XI J. front of his right wing. The j
gunboat Laguna de Bai, under j
Major Grant, had begun shelling the
enemy's position. Two companies of
the Twentieth Infantry and three com
panies of the First Nebraska, under
Colonel Statenburg, swung in from the
road to the water works, driving the in
surgents toward the Pasig River.
The First Wyoming advanced directly
on the insurgent position in front, one
company swinging forward with a yell, j
followed by the whole line, and in the
meantime the Laguna de Bai was
pounding the foe from the river.
Thus taken on three sides the in
eurgents after some resistance were
driven back. Captain J. D. O'Brien of
the First Wyoming was shot in the
-wrist and Major Bell of the Bureau of
Information . was slightly wounded.
Private John Curran of the Twentieth
Infantry was wounded.
General Hale subsequently sent out
a strong reconnoitering party, which
examined the jungie for five hundred
yards beyond our tines. No live Fili
pinos were seen, but the bodies of many
dead rebels were found where they had
fallen in the undergrowth. It is esti
mated by General Hale that 250 of the
enemy were killed. The village of La
Guig has been burned by the Ameri
- cans.
The natives resumed desultory firing
in the afternoon on Wheaton's and
Hale's brigades. Our infantry and ar
tillery replied and soon drove the enemy
from their position.
At the time of sending this dispatch
the Wyoming troops occupy an ad
vanced position. The insurgents opened
fire across the river from Guadaloupe
and killed Private Lovejoy of Company
C, First Washington, and wounded two
others.
The insurgents have been concentrat
ing to the east of the city and will prob
ably try an attack from that side. Their
principal object is to cut off the water
supply of Manila. The American posi
tions are strong and the attempt will
be futile. The insurgent losses have
been severe during the last few days.
The Madrid authorities have offered
Aguinaldo a ransom of $1000 each for
officers, $100 each for privates and $500
each for civilian servant prisoners. No
offer has been made to ransom priests.
Aguinaldo declares he has paid fili
busters $700,000 and has received inly
600 rifles and 2,000,000 rounds of ammu
nitJion. The filibusters say the re-'
mainder have been captured, but prob
ably they were never bought.
Another example of the treachery of
the natives was given to-day. Two
flags of truce were displayed by the t
enemy in front of General Ovenshine's'
brigade. Lieutenant Koehler and sev
eral men w/re detailed to advance and
learn what the Filipinos desired. The
lieutenant and his party had gone
about 600 yards beyond their lines
â when it was discovered that the bear
ers of the flags were armed and that a
number of natives were concealed in
the brush, with the undoubted inten
tion of massacring the Americans who
replied to the flag of truce.
As soon as the danger of the situa
tion was revealed, Lieutenant Koehler
and his men started to return to the
American lines. They had no sooner
turned than the enemy in ambush
opened fire on them, but fortunately
none of our men were hurt.
Later the Americans attacked the
rebels and drove them across the
Paranaque River, but they returned as
soon as our men retired from the
Â°la accordaâ¢* with instructions to
The San Francisco Call.

Private Rees Makes Bitter Com
plaints of the Treatment of
Volunteers at Manila.
â  STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 7.â George L. Rees, student,
O who was a private in Company K. First California Volunteers, lectured
Â§ to-night in the chapel on â¢Militarism and Democracy," giving personal
g experiences at Manila. His talk was a denunciation of the existing
O army system, with its abuses, especially those springing from the greed
V of officers and their disregard for the rights of the private soldier, bas*d
.*â¢ r, n the supposed inferiority of the private. He told how the men were
O given warm water to drink while in the heat of the tropics, while
*T the officers had plenty of ice water and Iced lemonade from lemons
S that the Red Cross Society had furnished for the use of soldiers.
a In speaking of the poor rations furnished, he stated that during
;â¢ the whole time that unhealthful food was being served to soldiers, of
-0 fleers, who were living on wine and champagne, knew the food to be
g sickening, yet refused to listen to the complaints of men on penalty
O of the guardhouse. He criticized Colonel Smith severely for his domi
a neering acts and for his failure to take into account that American sol
.â¢ dlera were more than machines and had an individuality that should
g be respected. He did not seem to think that Captain Cunningham of
0 Company X was solicitious enough for the welfare of his men. for
i? never was he seen to perform his duty of being in the kitchen when
meats were being prepared.
* "The volunteers," he said, "requested me to tell the American peo
Â§ pie of the dog-like treatment they were receiving. They are unhappy
O and will come home as soon as their terms expire. Not -even the regu
** lars will remain one day longer than they are obliged to."
S Rees does not see how the War Department can secure soldiers

der was issued to-day directing the
United States troops to give particular
attention to the specific duty of fur
nishing full protection to the lives and
property of all German, Austrian,
Dutch, Italian and Portuguese resi
dents, and with the co-operation of the
resident German Consul, to give aid
an<l assistance wherever necessary.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the tem
perature was S4 degTees Fahrenheit

ONE MORE DEFEAT
WILL SETTLE REBELS
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The War
Department officials were gratified to
learn through the press dispatches that
an attack had been made at San Juan
Del Monte and the insurgents routed
with only one casualty to the Amer
ican troops. Much confidence Is ex
pressed by the officials that one more
big defeat will so forcibly impress the
insurgents with the overwhelming
power and superior fighting qualities of
the American troops that they will of
fer little or no further resistance.
The transport Grant, with more than
a regiment on board, will reach Manila
in a few days. The Sherman is fol
lowing close behind her, and the Sheri
dan probably has a voyage of three
week, before her yet. With these re
inforcements General Otis' forces will
be augmented to the extent of four full
regiments of seasoned regular troops,
with a numerical strength of about
5000 officers and men. This will give
General Otis an army of nearly 35,000,
which, in the belief of officers of the
army, will be quite sufficient to cope
with any exigencies.
The following transports with their
conveying capacities will leave Manila
for San Francisco on the dates set:
Arizona, 1200. March 9; Newport. 600.
March 10: Scandia, 1300, March 11:
Morgan City, 700. March 12. The Zea
landia, with accommodations for 600
men. is in port at San Francisco, but
will not be able to sail for three weeks
because of necessary repairs. As soon
as the first named vessels arrive at
San Francisco they will be loaded with
tro-ops which are under orders to r>ro
ceed to Manila and sail with as little
delay as possible

OF A WOMAN
Vigilantes on a Man Hunt
in the Monterey
County Hills.
Determined to Punish With Death
the Brutal Attack Upon
Mrs. D.ouglass.
Special Dicpateh to The Call.
SALINAS, March 7. â Castroville,
eight miles from this city, was the
Ff^ne last night of one of the most das
tardly crimes ever perpetrated in this
county. As a result, the wife of a
prominent citizen lies at the point of
death. Eager to mete out justice to
the criminals, the men of Castroville
have organized a vigilance committee,
and should the culprits be captured
they will be shown no mercy.
For some months past a certain
rough element of Castroville has made
it dangerous for any woman to ven
ture out after dark in thf town. The
I Constable and his deputy have seemed
j powerless to bring the offenders to jus
â  tice. The reign of terror came to a di
j max when a brutal assault was made
I upon one of the most highly respected
women of the place, and since the com
i mission of this crime it has been
! learned that other outrages have been
! committed in the past, and that the
victims have feared to inform upon the
assailants because of threats of death.
James L. Douglass lives in the very
i heart of the town and on one of the
! principal streets. He has been at the
ranch of a relative in Blanco, some
miles away, and during his absence a
woman relative remained with his
wife. Last night, between 12 and 2,
there was a knock at the door. Mrs.
Douglass, taking a lamp, went to the
door and asked who was there. The
reply was that the person had a note
from her husband, who had been badly
injured that afternoon at the Bardin
ranch. Mrs. Douglass in her anxiet>
to learn the news opened the door,
whereupon the man snatched the lamp
from her hand, threw it into the street
! ar.d attempted to drag her out of the
i door. She resisted and he struck her
â¢j on tho head with a club, rendering her
1 unconscious.
i Mrs. McPhie, the other woman in the
house, escaped through a ha ok dor>r
and ran to the next door neighbor, A.
R. Quinn. and told the story of the as
sult. Quinn notified Supervisor P. Jor
dan and other neighbors and they has
tened to the scene.
In the meantime Mrs. Douglass' as
sailant and his companion â for it is
supposed he had accomplices â dragged
their victim across the street and into
a large grove known as the plaza. The
fiends kicked and beat her brutally.
She was left in a bleeding and uncon
scious condition. Evidently it was their
intention to kill hpr to prevent her re
vealing their Identity, and they thought
they had accomplished this purposp.
After a diligent search by the men
who w^re first made aware of the at
tack. Mrs. Douglass was discovered in
a critical condition. Medical aid was
summoned to try to save her life, while
a posse of men was organized to hunt
down the criminals. Mrs. Douglass fin
ally regained consciousness and gava
the description of one of her assailants
who, she said, was a short, stockily
built man. probcbly a Spaniard. From
the description a man named Castro
was Buapected.
This morning James Douglass, the
husband, found Castro and attacked
him. Castro, however, escaped and fin
ally eluded pursuit. It is thought he Is
in the hills east of this city. Another
of the supposed gang, F. W. alias
'Buck" Silva. could not be found, and
it is reported that he passed through
Pajaro on the morning freight. John
Castro, who also is suspected, is miss
ing. Sheriff Farly and a posse of vet
eran deputies are in hot pursuit of
Peter Castro, and Douglass is at thÂ«
bead of another posse. The Douglass
party is determined to hunt the man
down and hang him. It will not re
turn until the crime shall have been
avenged. At a late hour to-night Cas
tro had not been captured.
Mrs. Douglass is reported as in a pre
carious condition and the chances for
her recovery are remote.

NEW YORK, March 7.â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: Not only did Italy endeavor to ascertain what attitude
would be assumed by the United States in case of her occupation of Chinese
territory, but I learned to-day she actually asked this Government to sup
port her pretensions. The startling proposition greatly astonished the ad
ministration.
Never before has the United States been consulted by any Euro
pean power relative to its seizure of Chinese territory.
But the note of the Italian representative here is considered by the au
thorities as formal recognition of the new position in international affairs
which the United States has assumed as a result of the war with Sptin,
and of the immensity of the commercial interests of this Government la
Asia.
Secretary Hay's reply was brief and sufficiently plain to show Italy Just
how this Government felt. It distinctly and unequivocally refused to pup
port the Italian Government and stated that the United States had sever
supported or interfered in any way with the efforts of other government to.
obtain territory and "spheres of influence" in China, and would mos,. cer
tainly not do so in the case of Italy.
The tone of the note was deprecatory of Italy's intention, but no formal
protest was made and from present indications none will be. Italy's efforts
to get the support or at least passive consent of the United States die . â ;.
end with the presentation of the note and receipt of Secretary Hay's r^pl'.
The Italian Minister in Peking approached Minister Conger several *
ago and asked him to use his influence in getting China to consent â  :. â¢
Italian demand. Mr. Conger diplomatically evaded an answer, and :;
cabled to Washington. The instruction. sent to him was along the )â¢ â  - -
the" reply made her.. ' 6
While authorities' information show that Great Britain is diplor
opposing the Italian demand it is apparent to them that Great Brit;
within a very few days either distinctly reiterate her intention to r . ; , *
the integrity of China and support her open-door policy or annoi â¢
reversal.
It was stated to-day that no communication relative to the i^ctwsdfj
demands had passed between Secretary Hay and Sir Julian Pauncefr but
it would not be surprising if there had not been a discussion in Lone be
tween the American Embassy and the British Foreign Office.
The authorities are anxiously awaiting the announcement of Great Brit
ain's policy, for it is appreciated that it is of great importance to the
United States.
It was definitely announced to-day that so far as the United Stafca;is
concerned there is no intention to interfere in any way with the Italian rlt
mand or to take any step whatever, at this time at least. i j>,. ;
The administration is not even willing to use its friendly offices to open?
China's eyes to the delicate position she occupies, the idea being that it ifl
unwise for this Government to interfere in any Wky, in view of the di^icuit
problems already confronting it in Cuba. Porto Rico and the Philip
Besides the administration appears satisfied that although portions o the
maritime provinces of China are passing under the control of European
states no discriminating treatment of American citizens and their wade^f
will occur.
Diplomats best acquainted with the Chinese situation believe China vviii
not be formally divided up among the several powers. They think the-sev
eral governments will try to extend their "sphere influence" until practi
cally the entire empire is divided among them.
RIVER CHOKED
WITH CORPSES
OF THE SLAIN
Chinese Rebels Massacre Thou
sands of Men, Women
and Children.
VICTORIA, March 7.â According to
news received this evening by EL If.
S. Empress of India. China is again
disturbed by a serious insurrection.
This time it is the central provinces of
the unrestful land that are Involved.
In the province of Anhui depredations
were committed by the rebels, who. led
by Niu Suh Hsin, are over 10,000 strong.
The imperial troops, under General
Kuo. met thorn in a pitched battle on
January 23 and were defeated with
great slaughter. Hundreds were kill
ed, and their bodies, after havine been
mutilated, were thrown into the river
until, according to a correspondent of
the China Mail, the stream was like
a log-jammed crepk.
After the defeat of the imperial
troops, the victorious rebels swept on
to the cities of Kuyang and Meng
sheng, which they took after a short
siege. As soon as they passed the
walls they massacred men. women and
children and performed all manner of
revolting cruelties. They afterward
pillaged the Yamen and the residences
and store and then applied the torch to
the captured towns.
Aftor these successes the rebels
pushed on to Shachou and Katichon.
The gates of the former city were
opened by sympathizers within and
the horrors witnessed at their first two
captures were re-enacted.
Kauchon held out for some time. At
length Niu and his followers gained an
entrance to begin their slaughter. As
a revenge for his having held the city
against the rebels the unfortunate com
mandant of the garrison was butchered
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
with savage cruelty. It is said 200G
men, women and children fell in the
struggle attending the capture of the
city.
It is feared a great famine will fol
low the insurrection, for so terrified are
the natives that the crops have all been
left standing and will not n<> harvested,
The people were either killed or feared
to return to gather the harvest. Whole
villages and towns were tenantless and
in other towns who!<= streets were un
occupied, the late inhabitants having
been exterminated.
It appears that rebels and troops
alike waged a war of extermination,
neither man, woman nor child being
spared.
* A gentleman who reached Hongkong
from the vicinity of the uprising short
ly prior to the sailing of the Empress
said he saw numbers of mutilated
corpses floating down the river. Most
of the corpses were headless. They
were those of mal<=Â» and female, young
and old. He said he was sickened by
the sight of the headless body of a
woman with the headless body of her
infant secured to her back.

BURNS STILL WANTS
SECRECY TO COVER
HIS DARK SCHEMES
Afraid of the Light of Day on His
Senatorial Fight.
THE PEOPLE VS. THE RAILROAD
The Lines in the Contest Are Clearly Defined and the
Cohorts of the Corporation Stand Against
the Commonwealth.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 7.â The touts are still
working under cover to obtain peti
tions from the public calling upon
members of the Legislature to settle
the deadlock by the calling of a caucus.
Burns Is unwilling to accept the decis
ion of the Republican conference that
a majority of the Republicans of the
Legislature preferred to settle the Sen
atorial contest in the open. Petitions
have been left at saloons and pool
rooms, where residents and non-resi
dents, miners and aliens have been in
vited to sign.
The followers of the Candelarian as
sume that a candidate has the right to
call a party caucus to determine his
own standing in the contest. The fai t
Is that a caucus is the right of the
party and not that of the individual.
In many States the caucus system is
not recognized at all, and where it has
been brought into use it has been used
to bind the signers to the cause of the
party's candidate. In this contest now
in progress the Republicans of the Leg
islature are confronted with a candi
date brought forward by the railrcrad
i-nmpany. Had Burns announced his in
tention before the election to become a
candidate for United States Senator the
people would have understood the
question and obtained a declaration
from the candidates on the legislative
ticket, but tne intentions of Burns and
the railroad were carefully concealed
from the people.
It is too late now to come forward
and claim a "party caucus when the
party was not consulted as to the can
didacy of Burns before the election.
In view of this condition of affairs the
Republicans of California are follow
ing the course pursued by the Repub
licans of Pennsylvania â they are light
ing the Senatorial battle o-n the Boor
if the joint convention in open day
light.
The railroad says that Burns can win
if he can get a caucus. The touts say
that he will win if he can get a caucus.
In order to deceive the unwary, he may
feign weakness in the hope of luring
men into a secret caucus. The Barnes,
Orant and Hulla men understand the
programme, but they are cautioned
against the relaxation of vigilance.
The order has gone from the yellow
building to the servants of the corpora^
tion that the Senator shall be no one
but Burns. Members of the Legisla
ture representing Los Angeles County
received telegrams to-day, asking them
to bring about the election of a United
States Senator. N<> preferences were
expressed, which leads to the belief that
there Is a sentiment in that region of
the State favorable to the election of
an able and reputable candidate from
the northern part of California. There
have been so many vigorous protests
from the south against the considera
tion of Burns that the inference is
drawn that any other candidate than
Burns would be acceptable.
Wherever the people have been con
sulted the aspirations of Burns have
been rebuked. According to his own
statement, he became a candidate
against his will to rebuke the press of
the State for criticizing his public acts.
He presents no higher claim to the of
fice than a desire for personal vindi
cation.
When the whole truth comes to light
the fact may be presented clearly to
the public of California that Hunting
ton and Herrin had agreed to support
Burns at the time that the corporation
promised to support If. H. de Young.
Therefore, the declaration of Burns to
his followers that he did not become a
candidate until he was goaded to the
extreme by the newspapers was an
afterthought to justify his candidacy.
Whatever may have induced him to be
come a candidate, the stubborn truth
remains that he was not a candidate

when the people -were voting for mem
bers of the Legislature, and he has no
right now to demand a caucus.
Apart from all these considerations
he is not the man from a moral or in
tellectual point of view to represent
California in the Senate. Fifty-eight
of the eighty-five Republicans of the
Legislature are unwilling that he shall
be chosen- .It is possible that these Re
publkans, who are mindful of the honor
and welfare of the State, may lay aside
personal preferences and cast their
united strength in favor of some able
and clean exponent of Republican prin-
ciples.
It is acknowledged that U. S. Grant
has rendered the State ut California
distinguished service in holding his
supporters in line to defeat the designs
of Herrin and Huntington to force
Burns in the Legislature. Before the
session adjourns he may see his way
clear to advise his supporters to render
the people and party another great
service by joining a movement to se
cure the election of a Senator whose
choice will enlist the commendation of
the people.
The lines of the present struggle are
now clearly denned. On one side the
people are ranged and on the other the
agents of the railroad are massed. The
railroad forces are concentrated on one
side. Burns has the supportâ the open
and scandalous support Of the corpora
tion. The representatives of the peo
ple are divided, giving their support to
three candidates, and are daily coming
closer together and before adjourn
ment may consolidate the whole
strength of the people in the Legisla
ture on one man for Senator. The de
feat of Burns and the election of an
acceptable and reputable man to the
Senate would teach the corporation a
lesson that it would not soon forget.
At a late hour to-night there are no
signs of material changes in the Sena
torial situation to-morrow, although
Wednesday of this week was the tithe
designated by Grove L. Johnson for
the election of D. M. Burns.
Irving >I. Scott did not arrive from
San Francisco to-night as expected.
There have been rumors this evening
that Jlr. Scott would gain two votes
to-morrow, but the reports cannot bo
traced to a definite source.
There is a deal of comment among:
I the members of the Legislature over tht>
: utter failure of the touts to influence
legislators. The pet measures of sev
! eral pronounced anti-Burns men have
' passed both houses and received the
; approval of the Governor. Early in the
session the hint was hourly thrown out
that a member who should have the
temerity to oppose the election of Burns
would stand but little chance of secur
i ing the enactment of any cherished
measure of legislation.
Members go down the line and point
to the success of Senators Stratton.
j Davis and Smith in getting their fa
| vored bills through both houses. It is
i clearly evident now to all the leelsla
! tors that The Call was right In assert
ing at the beginning of the session
that the boast of the touts that they
coold control legislation was nothing
more than a bluff.
A public knowledge of these facts has
materially weakened the Burns candi
dacy.
Senator Currier, who went to Los An
geles two or three weeks ago for the
benefit of his health, did not return to
day as his friends hoped, but it is ex
pected that he will arrive to-morrow.
The special election in the Eiehth
Senatorial District to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Senator John
Boggs will take place to-morrow and
a Republican victory is predicted.

WORKING FOR THE
COURTS OF APPEAL
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 7.â John A. Wright and
Dr. Taylor, representing the Bar Asso
ciation of San Francisco, appeared -before
the Senate Judiciary Committee this af
ternoon to confer with that body in regard
to Senate constitutional amendment 1,
which relates to the establishment of
courts of appeal. The act is now in a
fair way to proceed on its routine journey,
though nearly two months have been con
sumed in getting it into proper Bbape.
The amendments to it have been numer-
ous and varied. Senators Dickinson,
Smith and Taylor have all had a hand mi
changing the original bill in some way,
while the bar associations of San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles have offered sug
gestions which have borne fruit. The
committee will meet to-morrow and next
day to prepare the bill, and its advent
upon the floor of the Senate will probably
be Friday.
EDUCATIONAL BILLS
ROUGHLY HANDLED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 7.â The educational bills
which have been before the Committees
on Education of both houses times innu
merable and which have been put through
a course of changes and amendments in
order to get them In proper shape to he
acted upon met with something which re
sembles a setback by the Senate Commit
tee on Education and Public Morals this
afternoon. <Â«
Bill 679 was literally hacked to pieces
and will be in such shape when it reaches
the floor of the Assembly that the author
himself will find 4t difficult to recognize
it. The principal features of thÂ« Mil were
cut out. That portion which gave the
County Superintendent of Schools the
power to pass upon all materials pur
chased by the school department for
county purposes waa dropped. This sec
tion has had the appearance of beim,r PÂ£
through for the special benefit of the
County Superintendent of Schools, for hi
the wording of the section it gives h m
unlimited power In the way of purohuj-iiiL'.
The portion relating to tenure of office
was also stricken out. In fact the relent
less ax of the committee left the present
law untouched, with the exception that it
compels the Board of Education to pur
chase only the State series of books njr
the use of irdipents. Bill 638 was amend
ed to legally recognize kindergarten cer
tificates and also compelling counties to
grant high school certificatse without ex
amination where the applicant holds a
certificate from another county. The omy
changes in bill 637. which creates and ad
ministers a public school teacher's an
nuity and retirement fund, were correc
tions in the phraseology.
ASSEMBLY RUSHES
APPROPRIATION BILL
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 7.â The Assembly finished
the second reading of the general appro
priation bill to-day and sent It to the
State Printer with instructions to print
it out of order and get it back with no
more than absolutely necessary delay.
Its third reading and passa-9 was made
the special order for to-morrow afternoon
immediately after the Senate special file
is disposed of.
Caminettl of Amador got an amendment
on the agricultural district appropriations
that strikes a hard blow at the county
fair industry by providing that the sums
allowed shall be drawable providing that
no games of chance or gambling games of
any description shall be carried on within
the inclosures. Caminettfs amendment
will work the greatest hardship upon the
Annual State Fair, that of late years has
become little more than good grafting
ground for Joe Harvey and other wheel
of-fortune artists who have made for
tunes here in the years past.
By the amendments that have been add
ed to it during its course through second
reading the total of the appropriations
carried by the bill has been raised $25,600,
but an offset to this is $3000 stricken out
with the position of Commissioner of
Public Works. *
As the bill was introduced in the As
sembly by the Ways and Means Commit
tee it carried a total of $5,097,704 66 : As
it will go to the Senate it foots up Ju.liO.
--304 68 As the bill of two years ago went
to the Governor it totaled $5,343,000.
The amendments that have passed carry
a raise of $14,000 in the postage, mailing,
etc.. allowance of the clerk of the Su
preme Court, a raise of $1000 in the trav
eling expense account of the Governor s
office- $1200 for the Secretary of State
with which to print the constitutional
amendments, $1200 for the traveling and
contingent expenses of the Insurance
Commissioner and a raise of SloOO in his
printing account, $4000 additional to the
printing account of the Bank Commis
sion, and $3500 for the printing account |
of the Harbor Commission. The Stockton
asylum got $6000 additional to its support
fund and $2400 was added to the bill for
the rent of Hastings L.aw College.
This afternoon Grove Johnson suc
ceeded in getting in a further amend
ment carrying $3000 to be used in improv
ing the basement of the Capitol. The im
provement will consist of a restaurant and i
bar room, and will make the "well" with
its villainous whisky a permanent fix
ture of the building.
The umbilical cord that once existed
twixt Dibble and Grove Johnson, and the ,
severance of which Grove announced but '
a few short days ago, was knotted to
gether at the loose ends to-night on the.
same proposition that caused the original
The row occurred over an additional
clerkship in the adjutant general's office,
which the bill created by making an ap
propriation'of $3200 for salary.
It was a pet scheme of Dibble, who is
a strong backer of everything that has to
do With tho G. A. K. or anything arising
out of the late Rebellion. Dibble wanteS
a clerk in the general's office to assume
a Â«hare of the duties, which have multi
plied since the Spanish embroglio and l to
index and catalogue the relics of the Re
bellion and the late unpleasantness Ha
has a bill now in course of legislation
which practically creates the position, and
he was naturally in favor of the appro
priation providing the salary. He was
backed by Valentine. â
Johnson objected, and after a hard ngnt
succeeded in having that clause ex
punged from the bill. To-night it was
broug-ht up again. Johnson gave smÂ«ljnÂ§;
consent, and the action of the other day
was reconsidered. Dibble got his clerk.
THE "BOYS" WILL NOT
HAVE TO GO DRY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 7.â Although something
of a. temperance body, the Senate has do
dtbiit to stand in the way of any little
refreshment a candidate may be willing
to deal out during a hot campiign. and
with that end in view the Senators hit
with their ax the bill introduced in the
Assembly by Caminetti which aimed a
blow at the ancient and honorable cus
tom of treating the boys. Â....â ,
Shortridge was the one who felt the worst
about it. He said there were some towns
in this State where a candidate could not
get a vote unless he went into every sa
loon in the place. "The bill simply puts
a premium on lying." he declared. "A
candidata will not tell the truth on a sub
ject such as this, and I wouldn t blame
him if he did not. I won't respect that
bill if it is passed. I'll do as I please with
mv money. I'll spend it in a saVoon or
wherever else I please. I'm 21 and I can
spend my own money without asking the
advice of this Legislature."
Wolfe described the bill as idiotic and a
measure that should never pass. It hit
Braunhart in a tender spot, too. for he de
clared the hill would injure one of the
principal industries of his district, for it
robbed him of the statesman's privilege
ot buying steams, sharp and cool, for his
constituents.
The Senate thought that was too much
and snowed the bill under a shower of
noes, among which there was not even
the suggestion of a notice to reconsider.

MENTO. March 7.â Dan Burns and his
gambling partners are not to have the
exclusive privilege of robbing the pen
pie, of the metropolis through the me
dium of the racing game at Ingleside
land Oakland racetracks. This much
â was decided to-day in the Senate by !
a vote that not only killed the poolselling
bills, but also demonstrated the idleness
of the Mexican's boast that he controls
the majority in the Legislature and can
kill any bill that displeases him or pass
any measure that he favors.
This was a field day for gamblers.
Bnd the war that was waged for and
against t;. s of the bills affect
ing their business was as bitter a one
es h; n here for many a day.
It was dog eat dog from start to finish,
end when the smoke o-f combat had
cleared away there was not enough left
cf Dan Burns, Ed Corrigan and their
packers to hold an inquest on.
To-night the poolsellers who came !
here yesterday with the determination i
not to allow Burns and Corrigan to se- |
cure for themselves an exclusive privi
lege for fleecing the public are celebrat- '
ing their victory. As their victory was j
Burns" defeat the .Mexican finds his
dream of a gambling trust, the profits :
of which would have been shared by j
him and his immediate associates in the
racing gums at Ingleside. so badly
shattered that there is no hope of its
future fulfillment.
There were two bills before the Sen
ate, one by Senator Sammy Braunhart
to limit racing to sixty days and the
other by Assemblyman Atherton to
prohibit the selling of pools on any j
sporting event except within the limits j
of a racetrack inclosure. This last bill (
was the most objectionable to the pool- (
sellers, as it was so worded that, had i
It become a law, the sporting resorts ;
where pools are now sold on prize- . j
fights and other sporting events would
have to shut up shop. In other words,
the racetracks were given the exclusive
privilege of fleecing- the public their
trade in that line being legalized by â 
legislative enactment.
- Overtures were made to Burns by the
poolsellers to have the bill killed, the j
argument being advanced that they j
had supported him in his political fights s
and he should now return the favor by \
assisting them. They had, they said, j
done all that lay in their power to elect i
him Senator and it was an ungenerous j
act for him to seek to monopolize the j
gambling industry to their great detri- .
ment. To these pleas Burns turned a
deaf ear, and then it was, and not un- I
til then, that the poolsellers pooled |
their issues and declared war on the j
Mexican.
Burns issued orders to his followers
In the Legislature but not all of them
â would obey him. Some of them were
under more obligations, politically, to j
the pool room men than they are to
Burns, and they elected to vote again:.- â 
the Mexican. Other legislators who
have been voting for other senatorial
candidates than Burns saw in the oc
casion an opportunity to disprove
Burns' assertions that he controls the |
Legislature, so they sided with the pool !
sellers. These legislators said that if |
the law as it stands on the statute
books to-day is not what it should be
it certainly would not better conditions
to pass other laws giving to th few
the privileges that are now possessed
by the gambling fraternity in general.
So it was that whe-n the bills came up
for action in the Senate to-day Burns
: found himself opposed by a formidable
array of votes. Still he refused to sur
render and in desperation called to his j
eid all of his henchmen who are still j
loyal to him. Among these was his
faithful servant, Assemblyman Wright
of Alameda. Wright left his Beat in the
Assembly to lobby for the pool bills on â 
the floor of the Senate, but he is dis- â ,
graced and discredited and his support
of the bills worked to their disadvant- !
age rather than to their good. It was
riot until the pool room men threatened
â Â£, support an amendment that would :
prohibit pool selling on every foot of i
California soil that Burns finally dis- |

played the white flag of surrender and
acknowledged himself beaten at his
own game.
The proceedings of the Senate com
menced with the consideration of
Braunhart's substitute for his original
bill 419. Senator Davis was on the
floor at once and submitted an amend
ment, which had the effect of removing
that clause which exempted race I
tracks from the prohibition against |
1 l selling. It made the bill atuilv
everywhere and struck poolselllng
from the State altogether. In speak- \
ing to his amendment Davis said that i
as it sto.nl the bill create- a monopoly
for those poulsellers who did business
at the rare track and he thoueht it j
was an unjust measure.
At this point, however, Braunhart
asked leave to withdraw the substitute
and put in its place the original bill
and permission was grunted.
Davis was not to be put down, how
ever, and immediately submitted an
other amendment which had the same
effect on the original bill as the former
one had on the substitute. Ashe
asked if he wanted to kill racing alto
gether, and then Jones wanted to know
why there was racing,' anyway; if it
was not to test the speed of horses what
was it for? To bet? To tempt young
men and women? He believed the
amendment should be passed.
Braunhart said he had introduced
the bill in good faith and in his desire
to have some restriction placed on the
vice of poolselling he was willing to
adopt any suggestion or amendments
which were offered; he was therefore
willing to accept Davis' amendment if
the Senate wanted it. But the Senate
did not want it, and ar't^r Wolfe had
spoken against it and had warned the
Senate that if it passed it would kill
the racing game in California, the
amendment went to a vote. The re
sult was a defeat by a vote of 20 to 11
as follows:
Ayesâ Braunhart, Davis, Doty. Jones.
I. a Rue. Nutt, Pace, Rowell. Sims.
Stratton. Trout â 11.
Xoes â Ashe Bettman, Boyce, Bull^,
Burnett, Dickinson, Feeney, Dwyer.
Flint. Hall, Hoey, I 'rd, Langford.
Leavitt, Morehouse, Shortridtce. Simp
son, Taylor, Wolfe â 20.
Leavitt jumped to his feet as soon as
the vote had been announced and mov
ed that the bill itself be denied en
grossment and third reading. "We
have spent enough time on this meas
ure." he said, "and we had better kill
it now. It is just as good as letting
it go to final passage and killing It
then."
The Senate was not at all backward
and without more debate the roll was
called on the motion and the bill was
denied further progress. The question
was 'Shall the bill be read a third
time?" and the vote was:
Ayes â Boyce, Braunhart, Bulla, Jones,
La Rue, Nutt, Pace, Rowell, Sims,
Stratton, Trout, Doty, Dwyerâ l3.
N oes â Ashe, Bettman, Burnett, Cut
ter, Dickinson. Feeney, Gillette, Hall,
Hoey, Laird. Langford. Lr-avitt, Luoh
r, Morehouse, Shortridge, Simp
son, Wolfe, Davis. Flint, Taylorâ 2o.
That ended the Senate legislation on
the subject of poolselling, but the Sen
ate was not willing to stop at that.
Atherton's Assembly bill was still on
the file, and to be sure that the job
should be well finished so long as it had
been begun Wolfe moved that the As
sembly measure be denied second read
ing. There was no word in defense of
the measure from any one, and there
was but one in the Senate, Braunhart,
who demanded a roll call. It takes
three to secure a roll call on such a
vote, and s<> the ayes and noes were
called for. What the noes lacked in
numbers they made up in noise, but it
is votes that count and the last piece
of poolroom legislation went by the
board.
There is indignation In the heart? of
several of those who came up to Sacra
mento to help Atherton's bill through.
It was Dickinson's measure practically,
and he was supposed to look out for it
in the Senate. Chark-s Burnell of San
Fnm< isc( came up to represent the
Merchants' Association and the people
of Sausalito, and he is around town to
night declaring that something must
have been thÂ« matter.
"Whi n the Atherton hill came up I
expected Dickinson to speak on it, but
he remained silent, and when the roll
call was demanded he did not even try
to make up the three. Finally when
the vote had been taken I went over
to him and told him to change his vote,
so we could pet a reconsideration, but
he said it would be no use, and so we
lost the chance."
A SMOOTH JOB
OF JOHNSON'S
EXPOSED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 7.â Assemblyman Rad
cliff of Santa Cruz stirred up a well-
Btocked hornet's nest in the Assembly
this morning when he called up a resolu
tion of Grove Johnson's, Introduced on
January 14. Mr. Johnson's resolution was
a peremptory order to the Committee on
CommlsHior.s and Public Expenditures to
investigate every commission now fat
tening at the expense of the State and
report to the Assembly which of th<-m
might as well be- dispensed with. Mr.
Johnson's resolution was adopted unan
imously, and that is as far as the mat
tor has gone. The committee has intro
duced no bills, made no recommendations
or any report. The resolution has sim
ply had the effect of staving off legisla
tion against commissions, with the hope
and trust that the committee would do
its duty.
Radcliff, who already has introduced
bills obliterating the Bureau of Highways
and Board of Railroad Commissioners,
saw through the lob yesterday, and this
morning offered the following resolution,
which was adopted:
Whereas, in the early part of this session of
the Assembly a resolution was Introduced by
the Hon. Grove L. Johnson and referred to the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MABCH 8, 1899.
Committee on Commissions and Public Ex
penditures to report to this body what public
commissione could be abolished^ in accordance
with the views expressed in Governor Gaffe's
inaugural address; and whereas, this commit
tee has failed to so act up to date. Therefore
be it
Resolved. That the Committee on Commis
sions *nd Public Expenditures be instructed to
forthwith make a report in accordance to the
demands made by said resolution.
Conrey of Los Angeles, chairman of
the derelict committee, replied to Rad
cliff's resolution with the statement that
the committee had done nothing: in the
line of its instructions for the reason that
there is a special commission now in the
pay of the State to fulfill the same du
ties. The committee, he said, would re
port, but its report would amount to
nothing, as it had done nothing. Mr.
Conrey considered that his little state
ment settled the matter, but Melick and
Radcliff did not concur with him.
When the standing committees of the
Assembly were being formed Melick of
Pasadena, who came up here pledged to
fight against unnecessary and expensive
commissions, applied for the chairman
ship of the Commissions Committee. He
was turned down by ex-Speaker Wright.
Radcliff. who came up here pledged the
same way, applied for membership on the
committee. He was turned down in the
same positive manner by the same
Wright.
Then Wright selected his committee
with Gonrey at its head, and juet how
well the committee has abided by the
spirit of its appointment is demonstrated
in the fact that it has brought in no re
port. It has simply pursued the "lay
low" policy and permitted Grove John
son's resolution to have the desired ef
fect, the forestalling of any legislation
that would tend to unload a lot of well
fed and overpaid Job-chasers on the
streets. , .
Radcliff does not propose to stop at his
resolution. He has a bill in course of con
struction which is designed to do the
work the committee was instructed to do,
and unless a satisfactory report Is ren
dered he will introduce It out of order.
DIBBLE JOCKEYS
WITH PLACERVILLE
"CINCH" BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 7.â Except for the state
ment that it "was all a mistake" Assem
blyman Dibble is finding it hard to ex
plain the latest jockeying that has been
attempted with Assembly bill 839. Assem
bly bill 839 Is the measure Introduced In
the House by Dibble, as agent for Drury
Melone, the Napa capitalist, and others
who are attempting to cinch the city of
Placerville to the tune of $2+0.000 by legis
lative enactment.
Dibble's first peculiar work was done
when the bill was in the hands of the Ju
diciary Committee. The friends of the
mining town went to him, explained the
crooked intent of the measure, and he
promised to let them know when it was
to come up for consideration. Instead of
keeping his word he got his bill through
one evening with recommendation that it
do pass, and the first notice its opponentb
had of it was when it turned up with
that recommendation on the special file.
Valentine of Los Angeles and Raw of
Placerville demanded that he return it
to Its proper place on the second read
ing tile and then recommit to the Judi
ciary Committee, and Dibble made warm
promises to do as directed.
ili.s second promise proved of as much
value as his first, for, taking advantage
one day of the absence of Valentine and
Raw lie stated from the chair, to which
he had been called, that the opponents of
t.he bill were willing it should go to third
reading and tinal passage and upon his
statement the House passed it along.
Valentine openly accused him of bad
faith next nay, and Dibble, seeing he was
caught, finally had the bill sent back to
commit tee.
The opposition spoke against it one
evening 1 . Drury Melone. whose interests
Dibble is favoring, explained his side of
the proposition on the next. Of the two
stories the committee chose that of the
people of Placerville, and the majority
amended that the bill do not pass. A
minority report was turned in with the
recommendation that the bill do pass,
and between the two reports opportunity
has beer, made for further manipulation
to the advantage of the instigators of the
measure. With a bunch of others the
Judiciary Committee's report was ren
dered yesterday and read from the desk
in the usual way. Then it was sent over
to tho printing office and to-day the As
sembly history came back with the state
ment that the majority had recommended
the bill to pass. The misstatement in the
history was at first laid to inadvertence
on the part of the printer by the oppo
nents of the bill, but further investiga
tion developed that the journal of yester
day carried the same mistake.
Mr. Raw immediately demanded an ex
planation of Dibble, but with a wave of
hand the agent for Melone dismissed fur
ther interrogation with the simple state
ment that it was a mistake. Mr. John
son, chairman of the judiciary committee,
and the other end of the umbilical cord
that binds him to Dibble, also waved hi.s
hand and said "mistake." Then the op
ponents of the bill went upstairs and
dragged over the minutes of yesterday
to see if there had been any interlinea
tions. There were nonej the report showed
plainly that the recommendation of the
majority was that the bill should not
pass.
Then the matter was called to the at- |
tention f>f the Speaker by a motion to
correct both journal and history. The
motion vas carried, and tb,e Investiga
tion continued, but nothing was develop, ci
to Â«how who had done the tine work at
the printing office. Later Dibble smiled :
again and conlided to a representative of !
The <:ill that it was all a mistake, and he '
was glad it was corrected, and Mr. John- j
son did the same thing, hut the Placer j
ville people are not satisfied with the ex
planation and propose to look further In- j
to the matter before allowing it to drop.
Dibble got a chance to get back at As- '
semblyman Raw during the session this
evening. That Is, the chance did not '
come to himâ he created it when it came !
time to take up the Ways and Mean?
unfinished business file. The hour set by
one of Dibble's own peculiar rules for the
consideration of Ways and Means busi
ness Is from 7 to 8:30 o'clock each evening.
Raw had a bill on file and due for its â 
third reading and final passage this even
ing that is of the utmost importance to Xl
Dorado County. It carries the appropria
tion for the J,nke Tahoe road, without
v.hieh that magnificent route to the lake '
cannot be kept open. Raw's bill wa.s due
to pass, and he wanted what was coming
to him. Dibble went down and talked
to Grove Johnson, and when the hour for
the file came along Johnson moved to take
up Senate messages instead. Dibble I
backed him and Raw objected, although :
h< was willing to let it go if Dibble and
Johnson would agree to give the Ways :
and Means file its full time when they j
should come to it. They would not agree,
and kept up thÂ«ir demand for the Senate!
messages, and it was granted them, de-
Bpite that Raw branded their action as
an unfair trick and accused Dibble of
breaking his own rules. When the Ways
and Menus file was finally taken up a
scant three-quarters of an hour was given
to it and Raw's bill went into the- discard.
SENATOR CURRIER
' NEVER FOR BURNS
LOS ANGELES. March 7.â Senator A.
T. Currier, who has partially recovered
from his recent Jllness, snent two hours
in Los Angeles to-day on business. He
left for his home in Spadra early in the
afternoon. The Senator will leave for
Sacramento either on Wednesday or
Thursday night.
Senator Currier, according to his
friends, said but little regarding politics
or the Senatorial embrogllo. Still suffi
cient has been learned from his intimates
to state with positlveness that under no
circumstances would he vote for Burns,
and according to one who Is very close to
Currier, "there Is not enough money in
the kingdom to purchase the Senator's
vote." Although Bulla has been re
moved as a factor. Currier is known to
still desire a Senator from the South, but
whether he will throw his strength to
Grant is not established. Currier has
been heard to say that he admired Gen
eral Barnes very much, which gives that
eloquent gemtleman's friends here en
couragement that the Spadra Senator
may support their choice.

TRYING TO
DETERMINE THE
COST OF LIGHTS
Rigid Investigation by
Finance Committee
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors commenced an investigation
last night which has for its object the de
termination of what sum would be a fair
compensation to pay the San Francisco
i Gas and Electric Company for lights fur
i nished the city during the months of De
cember, January and February.
The Inquiry is the result of the legal
i squabble which grew out of the injunction
sued out by the Mutual Electric Light
Company, which invalidated the contract
! made between the previous Board oÂ£ Su
! pervisors and the Gas Company for the
lighting of the city.
Mayor Phelan, Supervisors Perrault.
Collins, Attridge, Kalben, Deasey and
i Aigeltlnger; W. K. Summerhayes of the
! Mutual Electric Company, Edward C.
Jones, engineer of the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Light Company; C. O. G.
Miller treasurer of the company, and J.
E. Green, manager of the electric depart
ment, were present.
The company was represented by its at
torneys, William Xix and Charles S.
Wheeler. Â,. .. ,
After several hours of diligent though
fruitless inquiry into the cost of produc
ing gas, the cost of coal and other com
modities used in its production, the com
mittee decided to make an attempt to
force President Crockett of the Gas Com
pany to appear before them next Thurs
day* night with the books of the company
and prepared to answer all questions con
cerning the cost of making gas and other
matters involving the company's financial
affairs. This was deemed necessary in
order that the committed* may be enabled
not only to fix a compensation for the
lighting of the city during the months in
question, but for future months as well.
At the outaet of the Inquiry. Mayor Phe
lan and Attorney Rix indulged in a rather
warm discusslo as to whether or not the
committee had a right to Investigate the
private financial affairs of the company
during the course of the present investi
gation.
Rix said that the officers and attorneys
'â  of the company were not present nor were
: they prepared to go into a general discus
sion as to what would be a reasonable
price for lighting the city and county.
He said: "As I understand this matter.
we are simply here to determine what
â  sum should be paid for lighting the city
1 during the two months past." The Mayor
i replied to Rix's statement by claiming
! that in order to get at the proper com
pensation for the months in question it
would be absolutely necessary to find out
what it cost to make the gas or generate
the electricity. To determine just how

Edward C. Jones, the company's engi
neer, its treasurer. Mr. Miller, and J. E.
Green took the stand and testified to
various matters pertaining to the manu
facture of gas and affairs of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company in
general. All three of the gentlemen were
closely questioned by Dr. Perrault and
Mayor Phelan.
W. R. Summerhayes of the Mutual Elec
tric Light Company was the last witness
examined. He informed the committee
that in his judgment $3 per night was
ample compensation for the company to
receive for the arc lights furnished the

In answer to questions put to him by
Supervisor Perrault. Mr. Summerhayes
stated that the Mutual Electric Light
Company was prepared to furnish the
city with lights at a much lower figure
than it was paying the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Light Company.
HEAVYWEIGHT SLOGGERS.
The San Francisco Athletic Club held
its monthly fistic entertainment last even
ing on Sixth street ar.d a large crowd was
presentTO see the punchers punch.
Fred Jarrett. the heavy-weight pupil of
Professor Bean, proved to be a formidable
"dub" when he faced James Jeffords the
Cornish miner. Jarrett was <iulte clever
in foot work, but his hitting powers were
far from being dangerous. In fact. Jar
rett has much to learn in so far as
straight hitting and stopping are con-
Jeffords soon discovered that Jarrett
was a novice at the game and. finding In
a mix-up that several excellent openings
were offered for a knock-out, he quickly
availed himself of the opportunity to put
his apponent in his little bed. and with a
few well directed punches Jarrett went to
the hard and cold floor, where he re
mained for eight seconds.
On regaining his pins Jeffords adminis
tered to him a brace of Cornish left-hand
ere which settled all further dispute as
to locel championship. Jarrett took a
tumble and held the floor well in hand un
til counted out.

REARS AN ACADEMY IN
MEMORY OF HER CHILD
NOTRE DAME ACADEMY AT WATSONVILLE.
WATSONVILLE, March 7.â A
large concourse of people from
all parts of the surrounding
country assembled to-day to
witness the laying of the cor
nerstone of the Moreland Notre Dame
Academy. The building will be erected
through the generosity and munificence
of Mrs. Margaret S. Moreland in re
membrance of a daughter - ho died in
the flower of her youth. It is the wish
of the benefactress to bestow upon
girls the blessing of a religious educa
tion. Mrs. Moreland's generosity has
been bestowed without ostentation. Of
a modest and retiring disposition, she
Is of those who "do good by stealth and
blush to call it fame."
Previous to the laying of the corner-
Etone a dinner was served at the Man
sion House upon the arrival of the 1
o'clock train from Pan Francisco.
Plates were laid for 110 guests. Among
the visitors were: Right Rev. Bishop
Montgomery of .Los Angeles, J. Purcell
of the Hibernla Bank of San Fran
cisco, Father Riordan of Menlo Park.
Fathers Murphy and McNamee of
Stti.ta. Cruz, Fathers Farley and- Smith
of Hollister, Father Hudson of Gilroy,
Father Culllgan of Santa Clara Col
lege, Father Mestre of Monterey,
Father Mahoney of Castroville. Father
Ferrar of Gonzales, Hon. J. W. Linn
cott and Hon. Ed Martin of Santa
Cruz.
After the dinnner a large congrega
ton filled the Catholic church and lis
tened to an address by Bishop Mont
gomery. The prelate was at hfs best
and delivered an eloquent discourse on
the necessity of religious principles be
ing Instilled into the minds and hearts
of every one. He especially spoke of
deep religious sentiments being neces
sary in public life. Without these re
straints, he paid, the republic was al
ways in danger. The Bishop spoke
plainly of the combinations and trusts
now being formed all over the land,
forcing the poor people to the wall.
They were seemingly above the law, he
said, and it was very necessary that
some restraining power be brought to
bear upon these oppressors of the lowly.
The Bishop said that In this republic
secular schools were a necessity and
the Catholic church was not opposed
to them, but he claimed the right and
privilege of the Catholic church to build
itÂ« own schools with its own money for
the purposes of religious education.
Thf Bishop's address throughout was
broad and patriotic. He concluded with
a feeling tribute to Mrs. Moreland, the
founder of the structure for which the
cornerstone was to be placed, and
hoped the academy would be a blessir.g
to the people of Watsonville and vÂ£ the
State at all times.

GROSS FRAUDS
IN THE INTEREST
OF HERRINGTON
Santa Clara County Ballots
Tampered With During a
Recount.
SAN JOSE. March 7.â There was a
sensational turn to the Herrington-
CampbeM contest over the District At
torneyghlp to-day when Judge Hyland
announced he had discovered signs of
fraud perpetrated during the recount.
Not only this, but the guilty persons
had left their identification in the shape
of thumb marks and a dermatologist of
the Pudd'nhead Wilson type would
have no trouble In Identifying them.
All the ballots tampered with were in
favor of ex-District Attorney B. A.
Herrington, the contestant. On these
a cross different from those used on
election day had been employed, and
this Is what led to the discovery of this
most palpable fraud. In all probability
the stamp had been glued to some one's
thumb and inked with a pad in the
pocket.
Word was Bent to the attdrneyÃ on
both sides to be present In court this
morning, and It was supposed Judge
Hyland was ready to hand down a de
cision in the contest. Instead he an
nounced the discovery of fraud and
announced the reopening of the case to
allow the contestant's side a chance to
clear Itself of suspicion. The court
room was crowded and the announce
ment came as a thunderclap from a
clear sky.
Judge Hyland said he deemed it ad
visable to call the attorneys together
to make a few suggestions to them and
also to aid him In detecting the guilty
persons. In the election contests for
Sheriff's office. City Justice and County
Treasurer everything had gone along
smoothly. In the Herrington-Camp
bell contest it was different. attorneys
had flocked about Herrington to the
number of seven while Campbell and
only two others had looked after his
interests. Ballots were first passed to
attorneys for contestant to be exam
fned and each of these *^â¢ ***
handled the ballots. On February 6 the
Judge had been compelled to limit the
number of attorneys on both side* to
three. This left Attorneys Ho*ell
Moore F. C. Jacobs and B. A. Her
rington for contestant. hen the bal
lots were all counted the contestant
rested. Campbell then objected to the
Ninth Precinct being counted because
of irregularities. He also offered testi
mony to impeach six ballots . from , i
land Precinct. On four of these ballots
there were crosses which it was alleged

WITH HERSCHELL'S BODY.
The British Cruiser Talbot Will Make
the Best Possible Time Home.
NEW YORK, March 7.â The body of
had not been put there by the voters.
Attorney G. W. Cobb and two other
lawyers testified they were not there
when the ballots were counted in other
contests. A cross that had appeared
since the other recount waa different
from any used on the rest of the bal
lots In Vlneland. The plaintiff made no
attempt to deny or rebutt this testl-
mony.
Judge Hyland said that since the case
was submitted to him he had exam
ined the ballots of nearly all the pre
cincts In the county. He had discov
ered another ballot with this peculiar
cross. â  Instead of eleven blank ballots
as In the first contest, there were now
only nine, and Herrington had gained
i two votes. In a number of other pre
cincts counted up to February 5 he had
found this peculiar cross, and it was
always used in favor of Herrington or
to invalidate Campbell ballots. On bal
lots of those precincts counted since
February 6 he found other marks that
invited suspicion. It was a different
cross which, each time it was used,
showed the end or side of the thumb of
its user. This latter cross was not used
until after the counting of Vineland,
The law was then cited. The court
called on Attorney Moore, counsel for
Horrington, and psked what steps he
desired to take for an Investigation.
This question was dodged and Moore
j nsked Hyland to decide on the admts
slbllity of tFie Ninth Precinct.
Judge Hyland responded that he re
opened the case for investigation. The
question was. Had ballots been tam
pered with and who was guilty? Other
matters were of minor importance com
pared with the perpetration of fraud
in open court. The Introduction of bal-
I lots was the same as other testimony,
J and, when impeached, was of no value.
Attorney Moore was given till toÂ»
morrow morning to decide whether he
wanted an investigation or not.
J. H. Campbell, who was given the
certificate of election on a majority of
39 will undoubtedly get the decision.
After a strict watch in other contests
hi 1 -- friends claimed he gained over 100

Herrington he lost from the beglnntng.
however and at the close Harrington
was three ahead. Now this discovery
of fraud will throw out some of the pre.
rincts and makp Campbell a winner.
It is not believed the Herrington
forces will want an Investigation.
Judge Hyland's words were plain and
I there is no mistaking that he declared
â  fraud was committed. It is thought
the Grand Jury will be asked to look
Into the matter. The contest will un
doubtedly go to the Supreme Court.
Lord Herschell, accompanied by C. W.
Cartwrlght, secretary to the Canadian
Commission, and H. Williamson private
secretary, arrived in Jersey City .this
morning at about 7 o'clock from Wash
ington. The British cruiser Talbot, or
dered here from Bermuda to carry the
body home, was anchored off Bedloe
Island, prepared to receive it. Captain
Gamble, In command of the Talbot, said
the cruiser would sail as soon as possible
and make the best possible time home.

liam's action are apparently based on
the theory of his Majesty that Rudyard
Kipling's residence is in the United
States; that the fact that his wife is
an American and his sympathy for this
country make him an American in
spirit, if not by birth, as the distin
guished author was born In Bombay
December 30, IS6O.
The Post says: "The great cordiality
with which our monarch honors Mr.
Kipling ought to be calculated to re
mind Americans,- after a period of arti
ficial estrangement which we trust is
past, that they will nowhere find read
ier and more joyful recognition of the
brilliant features of their character
than from their cousins here and firstly
from our imperial leader."
NEW YORK, March 7.â Mr. Double
day to-night reported both Rudyard
Kipling and his little daughter Elsie
to be slowly but surely convalescing.
Mr. Kipling has not yet been informed
of the death of Josephine and he will
not be told about it until he is prac
tically well. She was his favorite and
the physicians dread the possibility of
a relapse should he learn of her death.
Some of the more important cablegrams
and messages are daily read to Mr.
Kipling, and occasionally he is allowed
to read them himself. Every message
is carefully censored, however, to pre
vent the father reading even an allu
sion to his loss. Great quantities of
flowers continue to be sent to the Gre
noble Hotel by friends of the Kiplings.
At 10 o'clock to-night Mr. Double
day said Mr. Kipling had done splen
didly during the day and had made
more progress toward recovery than on
any preceding day.
Mr. Doubleday, In deference to the
wishes of Mrs. Kipling, refused to give
any information regarding the ar
rangements for the funeral of Jospph
ine Kipling. The child, Mrs. Kipling
says, in no sense belonged to the pub
lic, and she wishes to avoid havine the
funeral take on the character of a
spectacle.
Rudyard Kiplinfr. it is reported, will
be elevated to the peerage on January
1. 1900. Dr. Neal McPhatter of Edin
burgh. Scotland, who is staying at the
Windsor Hotel, says he has received
the news from Sir Walter Besant. He
adds that the report is common gossip
in the literary circles of London.
Mrs. Kipling, accompanied by her
sister, Mrs. Dr. Dunham, and Dr. Con
land of Brattleboro, Vt.. early to-day
left the hotel where the author lies.
Shortly after 2 o'clock they returned
with fio- ers in their hands. It was
presumed that they had been to the
funeral of Mr. Kipling's daughter
Josephine.

JOHN H. WOODBURY. 26 W. 23d St.. Ne*
York, and 163 State at., Chicago.ALFRED FULLER'S HEIRS CLAIM
A WOMAN FORGED HIS WILL
OROVILLE. March ".âA sensa- ]
ti^na! v 111 contest. Involving j
al well-known people of
Chlco, is about to begin in the ]
Superior Court of Butte County.
Alfred Fuller, a. well- '
known citizen Â«.f <'hioo, deceased, will
file a petition to estop the probate of
an alleged holographic will by which i
the testator bequeathed all but $1/1 no of
hi? estate to Mrs. Minnie Houseworth,
as in no way related to him. The
will allege that the will, which
was filed for probate on October 19. J
â¢ en months after the death
Fuller, is a forgery. As the
witnesses to this document are men of
prominence this contest, involving as
s their reputations for truth and j
rity, excites more than ordinary
tifSi ttfNNfP HtWiPWOeTW â¢
interest.
Dr. J. Ellis Rodley, a prominent phy
sician and Mayor of Chico, and J. M.
Garner, a well-known farmer, are the
witnesses. They swear that the de
ceased on the 3d of August, 1897, came
to the office of Dr. Rodley -with a docu
ment which he said was his will and
that at his request they attached their
signatures thereto as witnesses. The
paper was dated June 9, 1597, and Dr.
Rodley added a superscription reciting:
the incident and the request of August
3. after which he and Garner affixed
their signatures.
Before signing the will Dr. Rodley
advised Fuller to go to an attorney and
have his will properly drawn. Fuller
refused to adopt the suggestion, saying
that "a Fuller never had his will drawn
but what he died a very short time
afterward." The testator requested the
witnesses to keep the fact of his having
madÂ» a will a secret.
This incident in itself was not at all
strange, but in the light of subsequent
developments the Fuller heirs are in-
P" led to look upon it with suspicion,
They do not accuse either Dr. Rodley i
or Mr. Garner of conspiracy, but they
cannot understand why the will was i
not found for a year after the de- i
cedent's death. Then the strange man
ner in which the document was found
and a sensational charge against the
man who delivered it to the devisee
add to the mystery.
. Soon after Mr. Fuller's death a vigor
ous search was made for a will. Mrs.
Houseworth was most anxious to find
it. as according to her testimony before
the probate Judge Fuller had told her
he had made a will giving all his prop
erty to her. She claimed Fuller was in
love with her for many years and only
the interference of his brother prevent
ed their marriage.
The Fuller heirs have engaged Knight
& Hesrgerty of San Francisco to con
duct their contest and Mrs. House
worth is represented by Joseph D.
Sproul. Theodore A. Kytka, the San
Francisco handwriting expert, has been
DYEA BUILDINGS
HAZED BY FLAMES
Conflagration Visits the
Alaskan Port.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 7.â Dyea had its
first big fire on the evening of March
1, resulting- in the razing of five build
ings and contents and a loss of over
$12,000, with no insurance.
The fire started in the Palace Hotel,
in the extreme southern end of the
town. It originated in the room of the
proprietor's wife, Mrs. McCue, while all
were at dinner. When discovered the
flames had made such headway that
they were beyond control and soon the
entire building was ablaze.
Dyea has no fire apparatus and is de
pendent solely on a bucket brigade.
This was quickly formed, 200 men
standing in a double line to the river
close by. Efforts were made to save
adjoining buildings and a building on
the opposite side of the street. The
fire-fighters failed on the first, but suc
ceeded on the last.
The Northern Hotel, adjoining the
Palace, was soon ablaze and was tot
ally destroyed, and the Chilcoot stable
of the Chilcoot Tramway, adjoining
the Northern to the south, also was de
stroyed. This stable was full of
horses, but these and all the wagons
were saved, and the bare stable and a
small quantity of feed were destroyed.
North of the Palace Hotel, where the
fire originated, the Senate saloon and
the Courthouse fell victims to the
flames. Several buildings on the oppo
site side of the street caught fire, but
were saved, In one hour's time" the
fire had burned itself out. Very little
furniture was saved from any of the
buildings destroyed. _
The glare of the fire in Dyea was
plainly visible In Skaguay. across the
mountains.

- employed to expert the alleged forg.-ri
! document. The sum involved is in the
i neighborhood of $40,000, which will be |
! increased if any portion of the estate
of Emellion Fuller, who died before his
i brother Alfred, should be included in j
the estate of the latter.
What Fuller did with his will after !
. having made it or to whom he entrust- j
:ed it is still a mystery. About a year :
' after his death, after all search had
1 been fruitless, the document was sf>nt
;by mail to H. Cormack, a reputable ;
1 citizen of Butte County, who had been
one of Fuller's close friends. Mrs.
' Houseworth, the beneficiary, obtained
; the paper and offered it for probate. \
: During the preliminary probate pro- '
: ceedings she swore that Cormack had,
without legal right, retained the will in !
his possession, and surrendered it only
on a promise that he would receive
$2000. This charge created a big sen- !
i sation here and in Chico. Cormack de
nied the charge and said he had noth
ing to do with the paper further than
to receive it and deliver it immediately
to Mrs. Houseworth. The beneficiary
i under the alleged will denied that un- i
I due influence had impelled Fuller to be- j
queath to her his property and declared '
that the only consideration was the
: love he bore her; that they had been
well acquainted for a number of years
and that the testator did not wish his
relatives to benefit by his thrift and j
frugality.
The story of the will as told In Chico !
is as follows:
Alfred Fuller was a very old man at !
the time of his sudden death in Sep-
t ember. 1897. He was known as a
shrewd, suspicions and careful old i
farmer-miner, sordid to a miserly de- j
i gree and a pronounced woman-hater. !
He never said a kind word for the op- j
i posite sex and when it was announced
! that he had executed a holographic
will, bequeathing all his property to a
woman, his acquaintances were greatly j
, surprised and those who knew him best
1 shook their heads wisely and declared
i'.cument should be treated with !
'< suspicion. The old bachelor's antipathy :
1 to women was attributed to a disap- I
pointment in love when he was a young j
; fellow back in the States.
On his arrival in Northern California.
in 1552, Fuller went into the mines and

A KLONDIKE KING
Accumulates a Fortune
at Dawson.
Special IMspafh to The Call.
REDDING, March 7. â Jeremiah I
Lynch, globe-trotter. Bohemian and
pamphleteer, is accumulating another ;
fortune. When he left San Francisco â¢
less than a year ago he turned his Mar
ket-street realty int" cash and resolved
to stake it all in the Klondike. His
Hale & Xorcrops experience may have
warned him to steer clear of mines, but j
anyhow the moment he struck Dawson
City he commenced a BeViea of trading
operations that have won for him the
reputation of being the shrewdest and'
nerviest trader in the Klondike metrop- '
olis. His accumulations for not quite I
a twelvemonth are placed at $150,000.
In letters to relatives in Shasta j
County the one-time protege of "Jim" |
Keene writes that he has been success- j
ful beyond his expectations. He is
making money as rapidly as he made j
it on Pine street in its palmy days. His â ,
astonishing success in Dawson is well
illustrated by a deal that he made
shortly after his arrival, which netted !
him $20,000. He bought 5000 sacks of
flour and within twenty-four hours
turned it over and doubled his money.
Storage rnsts money in Dawson.
Another deal equally as fortunate and
still miTP lucrative was the purchase
and sale of 8000 gallons of whisky. He j
is successfully dabbling in mines, but 1
his main operations are confined to |
trading in the Dawson market.
When James R. Keene left Shasta
County in early days, drifted into San j
Francisco and became a multi-million- :
aire. Jeremiah Lynch, then a young I
fellow in the town of Shasta, followed j
his friend to the < ity and became his
apt pupil as an operator in the share
market. That was the last that Shasta
County saw of Lynch save at rare in
tervals when he came on a visit to rela
tives in his old home.

of the McMahon Bridge Company by a
Grand Jury for the alleged altering of
the terms of a contract, was again taken
up by the county Supervisors to-day. The

was fairiy successful, returning to
Chico with several thousand dollars.
This sum he immediately invested in
various enterprises and in a few years
his fortune amounted to over $30,000.
After the death of his brother. Emel
lion Fuller, some years ago, Alfred was
appointed executor and administrator
of his estate, which amounted to up
ward of $75,000. The management of
this sum, together with his own prop
erty, was a task which greatly wn r ri>d
the old man, and as years went by he
became suspicious of every person who
acted in a friendly manner toward him.
He believed every one was after his
money. His heart became bitter
against all his relatives, and he was
especially chary in his relations with
women. He often expressed a fear that
some one would attempt to get his
wealth from him before he died and felt
sure that after his death his estate
would be the prey of some person <>r
persons who had no claim to it. He
took a morbid interest in the details of
the Rlvthe. Sharon and Fair litigations
and seeme ". to think similar attempts
to steal his estate would be made.
He died quite unexpectedly in the fall
of 1^97 and no will of any kind was
found among his papers. His estate
and also that of his brother went into
the hands of Public Administrator E.
M. Woodman, who still has charge of
the properties. Shortly after his death
a note for $15,000 drawn in favor of Dr.
A. J. Landis of Chico was presented
against Alfred Fuller's estate. It was
alleged to have been given in consid
eration for medical services rendered
and bore no interest. The note was
payable in two years from the date it
bore. The claim was repudiated by th"
public, administrator and suit was
brought to collect and this litigation is
now pending.
Several months after Fuller's death
rumors began circulating that he had
left a will, which could not be found,
and that Dr. J. Ellis Rodley and John
Garner had witnessed the document.
These reports aroused greater interest
in the case as many of Fuller's friends
declared that he strongly disliked these
two men and never n.egle^ted an op
portunity to speak ill of them. Mikli
speculation regarding the devisee and
the terms of the alleged will was in

The accident was caused by Hampel trying to tighten a loose screw

PLANS FOR THREE
BIG BATTLESHIPS
Will Equal Best Class
in the World.
Special tMspatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 7.
The plans for the three big battle
ships authorized by the naval appro
priation bill just passed are being
worker! out. The general features of
the ships have been defined, subject to
the approval of the Secretary. The
battleships v.-il! by a thousand tons
larger than the Maine and Missouri
class, of a total displacement of 13,500
tons, making them by far the largest
Fhips in the American navy and about
equal in dimensions to the best type of
battleships now being constructed
.'i broad under the new practice. Though
larger than the Maine, the ships will be
laid on almost the same lines, being
r-nly a little greater in every dimension.
They will carry each four 12-inch guns
in turrets. This caliber is an Inch less
than the guns carried by the Oregon,
but by improved design they will be al
most equal in penetrative power.
The fc-inch guns of the Oregon type,
although they did very effective work
at Santiago and Manila have been
abandoned. But instead of eight 8-inch
guns the new ships will have no less
than sixteen guns of 6-inch caliber, all
rapid-firers and twenty 6-pounders.
dulged In, but neither of the witnesses
enlightened the anxious public. Dr. ;
Rodley told a half dozen people that
he had, at the deceased's request, wit
nessed hie last will and that he also
had called John Garner into his office
to act In the same capacity. The doctor
did say that the beneficiary named wan
a woman well known In Chlco, but he
did not disclose her name.
Interest In the case began to flag and
had almost died out when one day last
August H. Cormack. a well-known and
DtJ J ELLIS RoDLEV.
respected citizen of Butte County, re
ceived through the mail an envelope
postmarked Chico. In the envelope was
thf long missing will, but no letter of
explanation as to why it was sent to
him accompanied the testament. The
will was written on an old piece of
blank book paper, evidently a leaf torn
from a book. The writing and spelling
wÂ»re very poor. Mr. Cormack, after
recovering fr^in his surprise, immedi
ately notilied Mrs. Houseworth and told
her "how it came into his possession.
Mr. Ormaok delivered the will to the
devisee and it was soon after offered
for probate before Judge John C. Gray
of Butte County.
Thfn followed another sensation. Mrs.
Houseworth, under oath, declared < 'â  r
mark had illegally retained possession
of the will and demanded $2000 before
he would deliver it. In order to obtain
the precious paper she consented to pay
that sum when she. came into th" es
tate. She also swore that Cormack had
pledged her not to mention his name in
connection with the case, i.'irmacks
reputation for honesty, rectitude and
probity had never before been ques
tioned and every one who know him
was surprised and on all sides the wo
man's stury was discredited.
Under instructions from Judge Gray
the Grand Jury began an investigation
into the alleged illegal detention of
Fullers will and the alleged attempt at
extortion, but nothing has as yet come
of the inquiry.
Mr. Cormack was one of Fuller's
closest friends and the mysterious send
ing of the will to him. months after a
futile search had been made for it, is
considered by the Fuller heirs as a part
of the scheme to deprive them of th^ir
rights. The heirs allege in the contest
that this procedure was simply to add
weight to the forgery. Cormack repu
diates the whole affair and says he had
nothing to do with it further than to
receive the will in the strange manner
detailed and that he immediately de
livered it to Mrs. Houseworth.
It is further alleged by friends of
Alfred Fuller that he did not have any
high regard for Mrs. Houseworth, al-
I though she maintains that he lovod
â¢ her and at one time would have married
i her had not Emellion Fuller interfered.
; These same people assert that the d*>
j ceased also had a afcroag antipathy f->r
; Dr. Rodley and John Garner, whose sig
j natures as witnesses are attached to
| the alleged will. Garner and Fuller are
I said to have had business troubles some
I years ago.
Dr. J. Ellis Rodley is one of the lead
! ing physicians of Chieo and is Mayor
jof the city. He <ame from Missouri
â  eleven years ago. John < lamer is a
j farmer. Mrs. Minnie Houseworth was
i formerly Mrs. West. Her first husband
died, leaving 1 her in comfortable cir
cumstances, but she has lost most of
her property. She married Houseworth
afterward, but the couple are now liv
ing apart. thf> hushand being some
where in Southern California. None of
1 Fuller's acquaintances were ever aware
: or suspected that he was devoted to
I the woman. Tt is hardly possible that
I a man of Fuller's habits and tempera
ment could have courted or shown
â¢marked attention to any woman with
j out It being noticed and exciting gossip.
This battery represents the ideal pro
portion between guns, taught by the
experience of our own fleet during the
Spanish war and of the Chinese and
Japanese vessels during their late war.
The speed of the ships will be IS knots,
an advance of two knots over the Ore
gon class, but just equal to that of the
n<'w Maine. For protection against the
enemy's shot the battleships will have
but one b^it of armor seven feel six
inches broad, running clear around the
water line, three feet six inches above
and four feet below. It was originally
planned to have this armor sixteen
inches thick, but the designers have
now reduced the thickness to twelve
inches. This change was made in order
to strengthen the casements, which
will be made seven and a half inches
thick instead of five inches

nual report in December he estimated
a deficit of J112.000.000 for the current
fiscal year and a little more than $30.
--000,000 for the nf>xt year ending June 30,
19f'O. The estimates made by Repre
sentatives Cannon and Dockery of the
House Committee on Appropriations
put the deficiency for the next year far
ab ive the figures of the Secretaryâ
Dockery placing 't as high as $100,000,
--000.
These figures, it is contended by
Treasury officials, are much too high.
Secretary Gage's estimate of revenue
for next year is $^10.9r.5.112. and the
appropriations for that year amount to
$673,658,400. assuming that the deficiency
appropriations for that year will be as
large as for this, which is a very liberal
estimate. This would make an appar
ent deficit of $52,700,288. It is expected.
however, that actual expenditures will
fail somewhat short of the total appro
priations, for it Is not believed such
large deficiencies^ will have to be made
up because it is expected there will be
a surplus in the appropriation for the
army.
About $10,000,000 will be received from
the Central Pacific Railway, and this
will reduce the deficit to about $100,000,
--000. enabling the treasury to begin the
fiscal year with a sufficient cash bal
ance on hand to relieve all apprehen
sion.
Should it become necessary for the
treasury to secure more cash than is
brought In by ordinary' receipts during
the next few years the Government
may do so by selling Central Pacific
Railway notes which the law authorizes
the Secretary of the Treasury to do for
not less than par and accrued interest.
While there is no probability that
there will be a treasury deficiency after
that time it is apparent that the war
revenue taxes will have to be main
tained indefinitely if Congress con
tinues to appropriate money on the
same scale as in the session just closed.
RUHLIN WINS IN
THE FIFTH ROUND
Easily Defeats Old Joe
Coddard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March. 7.â Gus Ruhlin
of Akron, 0., met and defeated Joe
Goddard of Australia in the fifth round
of what was to have been a twenty
round bout before the Lenox Club to
night. Both men stripped in excellent
condition, but Ruhlin had the call in
the betting. This was certainly justi
fied from his appearance, and from the
outset he held his opponent cheaply.
He evidently saw that Joe could not
offset his rushes and from the begin
ning forced the fighting. The Aus
tralian went down frequently with good
cause, but toward the close of the con
test he dropped without cause and was
deservedly disqualified. Ruhlin was a
2 to 1 favorite in the betting.
Round IâGoddard1 â Goddard opened with a left to
'> the body, landing lightly. Gus landed
1 with left and right on the head and body
: and was cautioned for hitting in the
j breakaway. A light left from Gus sent
! Goddard to the floor, but the old-timer
was up immediately, on!y to go down
again with a right on the jaw. This time
I Goddard stayed down eight seconds.
! When h" "Ot up he feinted with his left
and was met with a hard right on the
fare, and wont down a third time, re
maining on the floor almost to the limit.
When he got up there were only a few
\ seconds left before the round ended.
Round 2â Ruhlin sent his left to the
' face hard and Goddard dropped three
; times in quick succession. Ruhlin re
peated this dose and knocked his man
down with each blow. The referee count
ed six and nine and eight consecutively
while Goddard was trying to regain his
j feet, and the referee cautioned Goddard
â  to stop "holding."
R.iund 3â Joe was quick in toeing the
mark, and jumped to the center of the
ring. He dodged a vicious left from Ruh
-1 lin. but wont to his knees with a hard
right on the jaw. After a lot of fiddling
! Gus forced Joe to the ropes in the oppo
j site corner and put him down with a right
I smash on the jaw. The "old hoss" seemed
; used to such rough treatment and came
i up on the defensive, only to go down
; again with another smash on the jaw.
T ward the end of the round they were
both again cautioned for holding.
Round 4â Ruhlin landed two left hooks
i and a right on the head, which sent God
! dard down. He stayed down eight sec
i onds and came up. only to dodge a vi
i cious left hook for the head, but it landed
!In the shoulder and down he went.
' Throughout the remainder of the round
Goddard remained on the defensive
Round sâ Goddard opened with a left
> lead for the body, but Ruhlin sent a right
j and left in quick succession in the face,
i Then Ruhlin sailed in with a series of
I right and left hand smashes, every one of
! which landed hard, and Goddard accepted
them like an iron man. Each man was
: again cautioned by the referee to avoid
! holding, but Goddard could not withstand
! Ruhlin's onslaughts and dropped to the
1 floor without a blow to escape punlsh
: ment. This being obviously a transgres
! sion of Queenshury rules. Referee White
I ordered the boxers to their corners and
! declared Ruhlin the winner.
WILL PRAY FOR RAIN.
Los Angeles Methodists Designate a
Day for Fasting.
LOS ANGELES, March 7.â The Meth
odist ministers of Los Angeles and
vicinity will seek to learn why rain is
withheld fmm Southern California.
Wednesday of next week has been set
asido as a day of fasting, humiliation
and prayer. The committee that was
appointed by the Methodist Ministers'
Association to draft resolutions on the
situation has reported. The chairman
said the situation in certain districts
WAS appalling. The commitee decided
there was need of rain in the spiritual
as well as In the physical world. No
recommendation was made that the
churches pray for rain, but it was sug
gested they pass a day in humiliation
and fasting, and ank God why he has
sent this drought and what he wishes
his people to da.

THE END OF AN EVIL.
TIRE is every reason to suppose that racing,
which has degenerated in this community into
a vicious form of gambling, is about to be de
prived of its power for ill. Theie is firm ground for
the hope that the bookmaker, into whose hands daily
there has been passing thousands of dollars, some of
it stolen, much of it representing the earnings of
dupes, will have to seek other fields in which to ply
their vocation. San Francisco has stood the drain too
long, and too long calmly endured the spectacle of
and women being wrecked morally and finan
cially for the benefit of the promoters of "sport," and
an army of vagrants and touts.
The subject has been thoroughly exploited. The
story has been told again and again in the records
. I the courts ami the Morgue. It has been told in a
long list of embezzlements, betrayals of trust, sun
dered families, suicides and murder. Xo defense can
be made of the sort of racing permitted at Ingleside.
It is simply a gamble, with the percentage all in fa
vor of the professional gambler. The owners of
hordes will still be allowed to hold speed contests for
purses, and if they are sincere in their assertion that
they merely desire to encourage the breeding of good
stock, they can have no reason to complain. Indeed,
they might consistently aid the reform, since one
effect of it will be to make their calling respectable.
The majority of the Board of Supervisors is to be
congratulated. The ten members have shown a keen
appreciation of the demand for radical reform, and
they have boldly undertaken a task which will incur
for them the enmity of an element heretofore wont to
believe itself all-powerful.
Ingleside racetrack proprietors threaten if bereft of
their present unholy perquisites to nail up the gate
and go to Oakland. Perhaps this is a bluff; if not,
it is hard luck for Oakland. They will be obliged to
make a threat more dire than this before San Fran
cisco will get scared.
COLLAPSE OF c BOODLE BOOM.
THERE is a point in all speculation beyond which
it is dangerous to go. A steady supply equal to
the demand always tends to maintain prices and
keep the market constantly in a healthy and receptive
condition, whereas the moment speculators attempt to
force prices up or down clouds overspread the hori
zon, squalls break, hurricanes gather and everything
goes to smash. The causes of these commercial phe
nomena are overproduction, oversupply, fictitious
prices or the creation of a market in which nobody
has confidence.
The commercial law here imperfectly described ap
plies to legislative boodling as well as to the ordinary
boodhng of commerce. The maxim deduced might
be stated thus: Even political boodling has a boom
point beyond which it is dangerous to go. The
latest illustration of the operation of the law is found
in Oakland.
The Common Council of that city had a good thing
in the Contra Costa and Oakland water companies.
These corporations have shown on numerous occa
sions that rather than have their rates ''regulated"
under the February provisions of the constitution they
would come down handsomely, or, as it is expressed
in Oakland circles, "put up" gorgeously. Successive
Common Councils have worked the Alameda water
lords out of many an easily earned dollar, and fixing
water rates annually has long been considered a profit
able perquisite by the bosses, political parasites and
blackmailers of the coast Athens.
But according to ail accounts the boodlers this year
have overdone the business; in fact, they have forced
the price of votes for fixing rates beyond the boom
point, and consequently have not only demoralized
the market, but completely destroyed it. The mani
pulators who set out to make the two corporations
"come down" or "put up" â whichever you please â â¢
were on Monday thrown into confusion by the ac
ceptance by the corporations of what is designated in
water circles throughout the State as the "minority
order!" This schedule was framed by Councilman
Upton, and on being put upon its passage wasr
adopted by a vote of 8 to 3 â three Councilmen
friendly to the water companies having been directed
by them to vote for it. Thus the water lords escaped
the clutches of the politicians and demonstrated once
more that even boodling can be overworked.
There is but one conclusion to be drawn from the
facts of this case â the price demanded by the water
rate fixers must have been terrifying. Otherwise the
corporations would never have considered the Upton
ordinance. Were the boodlers misled by the dry
year? Something must have inspired the extraor
dinary confidence which they displayed.
COME TO THE POINT.
IT is impossible to bring the supporters of Dan
Burns to a point, because they have no point
that will bear publicity. An admission on their
part that there is any standard by which a candidate
for the Senate of the United States should be tested
would show a little respect for the public. Then, if
they would concede that the standard ought to com
prise brains, education, knowledge, experience and
integrity, a further step would be gained. If they
climbed thus far out of the mire in which they appear
to be stuck they might probably acknowledge that the
manipulation of unclean politics, State or municipal,
is an unseemly preparation for the consideration and
settlement of great national affairs. By this time
they would have almost reached the level of practical
citizenship of a comparatively decent type, although
they would still fall short of the lofty ideals of Ameri
can statesmanship. There would remain only two
questions to be settledâ first, has Burns any of the
qualifications enumerated? and, second, is not the
conceded disqualification the sole claim that has been
advanced on his behalf?
But, compared to the Burns touts, who have lost
their sensibility and their senses by riding on rail
road tracks, the hide of the hippopotamus is thin,
the hearing of the adder acute and the vision of the
mole sharp. They are equally stolid and impervious.
Their only watchword is "Burns," and the only other
word they know in its full signification is "Boodle."
Party names, still more political principles, for them
have no meaning. The voice of the people may swell
to a roar, but it will not disturb their equanimity.
Patriotism and Americanism are as alien to them as
virtue to a courtesan or the sanctity of an altar to the !
inmate of a dive.
There is no remedy, therefore, but to batter these
political Filipinos back to the brush from which they
emerged, and this unpleasant labor cannot be done
by the press alone. Citizens and their chosen repre
sentatives must finish the job. They at least are not
bent on satiating personal malice by disguising a
railroad saint as a political sinner. They are not
jealous proprietors of obstreperous newspapers that
meanly advocate political decency and the preserva
tion of the honor of the State. Nominally they own
the State, and they really Have its fame and its in
terests in their keeping. They have some right to in
quire who Dan Burns is and what he has ever said
or done, what qualities or associations he has that re
lieve his pretensions from sheer audacity. They may
be permitted to insist that a railroad tool, with the
reputation of a defaulter, with a name at once mentally
blank and morally malodorous, has no vested right or
titie. merely because of these facts, to a Federal Sen- !
atorship. They may even be pardoned for concentrat- j
ing their influence and their votes upon the prompt |
election of a Republican, a statesman and a gentle-
THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT BILL.
ARGUMENTS p r e sente d by the delegation of
citizens from Santa Clara County against the
county government bill are sufficiently strong
to justify its rejection, even if not another county
made a protest or not another word of opposition was
uttered. They were made up of plain statements of
the effects the bill would have upon the government
of Santa Clara County itself, and they have therefore
all the force of stubborn facts not to be gainsaid or
ignored.
The Santa Clara men, several of whom are county
officials, pointed out that the bill if enacted will in
crease the cost of government in their county by up
ward of $50,000 a year without in any way increasing
the effectiveness of the administration of county af
fairs or promoting the general good. The statement
was supported by an analysis of the various ways by
which the cost of government would be augmented.
From the showing thus made it appears the cost of
county government in Santa Clara would be increased
by the salary of a clerk of Board of Supervisors
$125 a month, a Deputy Sheriff $1800 a year, a Li
cense Collector $150 a month; two additional assist
ants in the office of District Attorney, one at $1200
and the other at $1500 a year; a Deputy County Sur
veyor at $1000 a year; and. furthermore, the Sheriff
is to have additional fees and the Surveyor is to have
besides his deputy such other assistance as may be
necessary.
It must be borne in mind that the county has al
ready a Supervisors' clerk, a Deputy Sheriff, a License
Collector, and the District Attorney has two assist
ants in his office. The proposed additions will there
fore add nothing to the service of the county. Their
effect will be merely the creation of new salaries.
There are, moreover, other objections to the bill.
Under it Township Justices are to receive $150 a
month and be furnished with an office and a clerk at
$75 a month; constables are to receive $125 a month
and free office room; Supervisors are to be author
ized to let contracts for bridge building without call
ing for bids, and are to have control of all county
printing.
Such would be some of the effects of the proposed
bill upon counties of the class to which Santa Clara
belongs. It is not strange, therefore, that her press
and her people should protest against it. It might
well be entitled a bill to increase the number of
county officers, the rate of salaries and the burden of
taxation.
The people of Santa Clara deserve credit for the
attention they have given this subject and the vigor
with which they have opposed it. If in every part of
the State the citizens were equally vigilant and atten
tive to public matters California would be much bet
ter governed than it is. After all the people of a free
country generally get the kind of legislation they de
serve, and Santa Clara clearly merits a good govern
ment, for she has shown a willingness to study public
affairs and to work for economy, both at home and at
Sacramento.
WAR CONGRESS APPROPRIATIONS.
\A R. CANNON'S statement of the causes lead
/ \ ing to the enormous appropriations made by
* * the late Congress is in the main sufficiently
satisfactory to offset any objections that may be urged
cither by the partisans of the- opposition or by ex
treme economists. The Republican party can safely
support the work of the war Congress before the peo
ple, and with justice ask popular approval of almost
every item of the vast expenditure, which in the ag
gregate amounted to more than a billion and a half
of dollars.
There were two items of increased expenditure,
however, which the intelligence of the country will
not approve. The first of these is the increase in
pensions over those of last year to the amount of
$4,000,000, and the second is the increase over last
year of $16,000,000 for the postal service. In neither
of these items should there have been any material
increase of expenditure whatever. On the contrary,
the country had a reasonable right to expect a de
crease in each.
The war with Spain has of course added to the
names on the pension roll, and the nation does not
grudge one dollar of expense thus honorably imposed
THE SAST FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1899.
upon the taxpayers. But there should be a decrease
in the former pension rolls. The Civil War closed
thirty-five years ago, and yet the number of pen
sioners claiming pensions for service in that war con
tinues to increase, and the end is not yet. That some
thing of fraud exists in this condition of affairs is
beyond question, and the Republican party, whose
loyalty to the veterans who followed Grant and sup
ported Lincoln in the war for the Union is not
doubted, should undertake the work of purging the
pension lists of dishonest claimants and make it what
it should beâ a roll of honor for the deserving brave.
For the increased expenditure for the Postoftice
there is no justification whatever. The postal ser
vice in Great Britain, in France and in Germany is
self-supporting, and even yields a revenue to the
state. There is no reason why similar results should
not be obtained in this country. Congressman Loud,
chairman of the Postal Committee of the House, has
repeatedly urged a reform in the sen-ice which would
greatly diminish the expenditures and get rid of the
deficit. Every effort in that direction, hoover, ha
failed, and as a result every increase in the business
of the Postoffice is followed by an increase of the de
ficit.
With the exception of the items noted, the appro
priation bills of the war Congress will stand the test
of popular judgment. We have fought a great na
tion and conducted a war on both sides the globe
without pausing in our work of internal improvements
or checking in any way our ordinary expenditures for
the upbuilding of the republic. The burden has been
vast, but upon the mass of the people it sits so lightly
it is hardly noted. Speaker Reed once answered the
attacks of the opposition upon the liberal appropria
tions of the Fifty-first Congress, with the epigram,
"This is a billion dollar country." He can now say it
is growing fast to be a two billion dollar country and
the people stay with it.
SENATOR MORGAN, the sincerity of whose
support of the Nicaragua canal project is not
to be doubted, is reported to be well satisfied
with the results attained by the friends of the mea
sure in the late Congress. A letter attributed to him
says: '"The earnest and patriotic purpose of the
President to construct a canal has been responded to
by Congress in a decisive and conclusive way, and the
foundation has been laid, which will never be shaken,
for this work of universal benefaction."
It is to be hoped this sanguine view of the situation
is correct, for it is much more hopeful than that taken
by the public. Despite the high authority of the Sen
ator, however, there will be widespread doubt of its
correctness. The Senator is growing old and has
acquired a habit of seeing things as he desires them
rather than as they are. It is possible, and even prob
able, that in this case, as in many others, he has per
mitted the wish to be father to the thought, and in
dulge? the belief that he has accomplished much for
the canal, when as a matter of fact the enterprise has
been stalled for years to come.
Congress voted an appropriation for a survey of
all the suggested routes for the canal, but not a dollar
for beginning construction on any of them. Under
the act the commission charged with the survey will
have to report upon the Panama route as well as upon
that of Nicaragua. This on the face of it is a victory
for the Panama Company. Their project now stands
on the same footing with that of Nicaragua, and an
opportunity is afforded them to make a strong fight
when the next Congress meets.
With two projects undjpr discussion it will be easy
for the opponents of the measure to set up one
against the other and thus provoke a rivalry which
will indefinitely postpone action. If public sentiment
becomes divided as to which route would be the bet
ter, there will be an inevitable weakening of the
forces in favor of a canal, while the antagonists of the
enterprise will remain as firmly united as ever, and
have the further advantage of pretending to support
one project or the other, while really preventing the
adoption of either.
We have seen such tactics employed with success
for a good many \ r ears by the opposition to the pro
posed reforms in the postal regulations designed to
make the service self-supporting. Two plans were
advanced in the late Congress for that purpose â one
proposed to check the abuse of the second class mail
privilege, which entails such a heavy expense upon
the service; the other proposed to reduce the
amounts paid to the railroads for carrying the mails.
The adoption of either of these would have resulted
in a saving sufficient to put an end to the annual
deficit in the Postoftice Department.
When the first plan was submitted to the House,
however, it was defeated by men who said they pre
ferred the second plan. When the second was sub
n.itted it was defeated by men' who declared them
selves in favor of the first plan. Thus nearly every
member of Congress made a record in favor of pro
viding a remedy for abuses in the postal service and
establishing the service on an economical basis, and
yet nothing was accomplished. Congress, it appears,
was well nigh unanimous that something should be
done, and equally unanimous in resolving not to do it.
There is a danger that such tactics win now be used
against the canal enterprise. The friends of Panama
will vote against Nicaragua, and the friends of
Nicaragua will oppose Panama. Such is the situation
as it appears to-day, and it behooves the real ad
vocates of the enterprise to be active and vigilant, or
the results in the next Congress will be only another
postponement and an appropriation for another
survey.
One of the Supervisors declared in open session
that he was not acquainted with "Colonel Mazuma,"
which, so far as any personal relations with him are
concerned, might easily be true. But Colonel Mazuma
has a right to feel offended to learn that his identity
is unknown to any citizen of California.
Rev. Dr. Brown explains that he never denounced
Dan Burns, but that, on the contrary, he admires the
gentleman from Mexico. We freely add the informa
tion that the Brown in question is not the one of
Overman fame.
"Smiling" Billy Hamilton now has to do the work
which the Government pays him for doing, and his
smile is only a memory. It was the Hamilton idea
to draw a salary and put in his time whooping things
up for Burns.
There is a familiar aspect about the proposition to
build a hospital for the city and county to take the
place of the rickety thing which now insults the in
digent citizen. Such a rumor is always in order.
California will be glad to congratulate Shafter upon
being made a major-general, but it was a cruel blow
for the Examiner.
Announcement is made that Alger is coming to
this coast. His reception will depend upon whether
he shall come before or after resignation.
Reports that Fitzsimmons has a bad elbow do not
interest the public much, but may be valuable for

A special committee of the Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association was at
work yesterday upon a matter th;it
in â  ;i nt the pain or loss of millions of
dollars to this city and State. Some time
ago Colonel Long of the quartermaster's
department, whoso special business for a
>( :tr or more has been to furnish supplies
and tit out the Government transports
for Uncle Sam, requested of the State
Harbor Commissioners ;i suitable place
fur the docking of vessels under his
charge. He represented that suitable
docking: facilities are absolutely necessary
in order to meet the demands of the Gov
ernment in dispatching the transports
that carry provisions, munitions of war
and soldiers to the Pacific squadron in
Manila as will as the other parts of the
Western ocean.
Colonel Long called particular attention
to the fact that in the past he has fitted
out these expeditions at great inconveni
ence to himself and the department. That
was during the emergencies of the late
war, when it was necessary to make the
of everything.
Recent developments indicate that the
T'nited States will continue to hold many
or possibly all of the new Pacific posses
sions and that tlvre will be a large
amount of shipping by the Government
from this side of the continent to the
Orient. Hence, suitable docking facilities
are an absolute necessity.
The officers of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Ass.. nation were stirred to
quick action yesterday by the information
that Seattle is making an effort to draw
1 â¢ ilovernment supply department away
from San Francisco and install it in the
Puget Sound city. A short time ago the
Seattle Chamber of Commerce beld a
meeting and discussed the request of Co!
--onel Long made to the California State
officers. The result of that meeting was
telegraphed to the department at Wash
ington and to Colonel Long. It was noth
ing Less than an offer to the Government
of free dockage and the granting of
every concession that the department
would ask if the Pacific base of supplies
would be moved from San Francisco to
Seattle. Attention was called to the fine
harbor of the north and to the railroad
facilities of tin.' northern route over which
munitions and supplies obtained in the
East could be shipped to that port.
The local manufacturers detemined that
the advantage already gained by San
Francisco could not properly be allowed
to be iost. A meeting was therefore held
yesterday and the situation was thor
oughly discussed. The argument was pre
sented that this port is the besi adapted
to the shipping of supplies in the Pacific,
being centrally situated. The department
is already located here, and the benefits
to the State received during the past few
months show that during the late war
supplies of various kin. ls amounting to
about two and a half million dollars were
purchased here, and since then much more
Government money has found its way Into
the pockets of local manufacturers. With
purchases already made and goods sent i
from the East, aside from ammunition, j
the Government has shipped from the
port of San Francisco cargoes valued at
over eight million dollars.
To permit such a trade to go elsewhere
would be commercial suicide, and a com
mittee, consisting of J. W. Kerr and
Manager Goodwin, started out for Colonel
Long with whom a conference was hold,
and later a visit was paid to the Harbor
Commissioners. The result of their efforts,
as shown by the foregoing, was most sat
isfactory, and at the next meeting they
will report that the patronage of the
Government has been saved to this city
through the timely action of the Manufac
turers' Association and the Harbor Com
missioners.
A BIG MINING COMBINE.
Alfred B. Adams, Mexican Mine Pro-
moter, Tells of Rich Ledges.
Alfred B. Adams, who has been in Mex
ico for the past four years endeavoring
to consolidate vast mining properties in
Durango, arrived here yesterday and is
registered at the Occidental. He has
finally succeeded in his efforts, and the re
sult Is the formation of a company called
the Consolidated Mines of Copalquin, of
which he is the director general. He is
here to get bids on an extensive electric
machinery plant with which the mines
will be equipped.
"This company," said Mr. Adams, "has
been incorporated under the laws of New
Jersey and Mexico, and we have letters
patent from the latter Government for
twenty-seven large mines. For two years
I have worked to bring about the consoli
dation of valuable properties, and found
it a difficult task owing to the disinclina
tion of the natives to work their mines
in any other but the crude way. Finally
the De la Rocha family, who own the
larger portion of the claims, agreed to
the combination.
"Principal among the mines is the El
Refugio, which was discovered in 1849.
Even with the primitive methods em
ployed by the natives a fabulous amount
of gold and silver has been extracted.
Over a million dollars in bullion has been
sent to the Mint here during the last five
jcsarsv TUne are C\)jjw .tons of ore in
sight, which runs $27 37 to the ton. It is
free milling ore and the ordinary stamp
mill process is used entirely.
"There are fifteen stamp mills now op
erated by water power. At the junction or
the Limon and Copalquin rivers, which
flow through the properties, we will erect
the electric plant, for which I have come
to this country to negotiate. The com
pany was capitalized at $1,000,000. and the
native owners were given stock to the
value of their holdings. Everything is
now in legal shape under the laws of both
the United States and Mexican Govern
in, nta. I will return to Mexico in three
weeks, and after the machinery has been
constructed 1 may proceed to London and
from various syndicates."
MATTERS IN THE MISSION.
The Valencia Street Residents Want
a Bitumen Pavement.
The ftrat matter that came before the
Mission HuMlness Men's Association,
which nut at i 66 Valencia street last Mon
day evening, was the paving of that prom
im nt thoroughfare. A petition containing
over 600 names will be presented to the
Supervisors asking that bitumen may take
the place of the uneven stones that dis
figure the most important street in the
Mission district. Secretary Harrison of
the association reported a wrecked
at Army street and Potrero avenue was
making a malaria-breeding pond in that
vicinity. . .
Messrs. d'Artenay and Wynne reported
thai Manager Vining had no intention of
taking the cable cars off Twenty-fourth
street and operating the Howard street
cars on Twenty-sixth street. It is the in
tention of the railroad company to change
the Howard street cable system to an
electric line. Jf it be decided to run the
Sixth street line down Post from Taylor
to Montgomery it will be the means of
bastening the reconstruction of the entire
Post street system. It is contemplated
by the company to change the Sansome
and Montgomery street horse systems to
trolleys.
The Outpost was made the official organ
of the Mission Business Men's Association.
and Secretary Harrison, its editor and
publisher, put under salary.
In the future the association will meet
every Monday night in Mission Turn Ve
rein Hall on Eighteenth street, between
Valencia and Guerrero.

RESPONSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE
CONTINUES IN OPPOSITION TO
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.
Secertary Dunne Ordered to Frame *
New ordinance Regulating the
Swab Test in Cases of
Diphtheria.
The Board of Health of this city at a
special and secret meeting on Monday
evening determined that it was the duty
of the board to maintain its quarantine
service. By a recent decision of the Su
perior Court it was held that the Federal
law providing for a fiuarantine service
superseded the State law. This legislated
Dr. Chalmers, the State official, out. of
office.
The court held that the quarantine of
ficial appointed by the Tnited States Gov
ernment had jurisdiction over for
eign vessels entering this port. It
was determined to appeal from this
decision. The members claim they are
held responsible for the health of the
city and that it would not become them
to neglect so potent a factor in the dis
semination of disease germs as vessels
from foreign ports could be. If a plaguo
was spread here the people would hold
the board responsible.
The Quarantine Department will he
maintained r.ntil the matter shall have
been finally adjusted.
The Ma'noncy case was discussed in all
its bearings. 'This is the one in which
it was decided by the court that the or
dinance requiring the swab test in casea
of diphtheria applied to suspected
only and not to those where the, aisease
wa.s known to exist. Secretary Dunne.
was instructed to frame a new ordinance
correcting the defect in the present one.

the health of the children.

REINSURANCE ON ALCIDES
NO ONE APPEARS TO WANT
THE TEMPTING OFFER.
Narrow Escape of Three Sailors of
the British Ship Olivebank â Lu
ella Beats the Point Arena
in a Race.
Judging from the rate of reinsurance
raid on vessel and cargo, the English un
derwriters do not like the chances of the
British ship Alcides for making port in
safety overmuch. Judging the matter,
however, from the facts in the case, and
the vessel does not appear to be overdue,
hor is there anything to warrant the pay
ment of 40 per cent reinsurance, unless
the owners and agents in London have
Information of some disaster that has not
yet reached San Francisco.
Here are the facts in the case. The
British ship Alcinous sailed from San
Francisco for Liverpool on September 2S,
IS9B. The Guiseppe sailed for Cork on j
October 6, the Clan Graham for Liverpool j
on October 14, the Alcides for London on J
October 17. the Waterloo for London on j
October 21 end the Clackmannanshire j
from Astoria for Cork on November 17,
IS?*.
The Waterloo passed Prawle Point on
her way to London on the sth lnst. and \
the Clackmannanshire arrived at Lim- \
crick on the 6th inst. Out of the fleet men- |
tioned these are the only vessels that
have made port, and of the others the i
Clan Graham is out three, the Guiseppe j
eleven and the Alcinous nineteen days
longer than the Alcides, but these vessels
are not quoted in the overdue market,
while 40 per cent reinsurance is being â¢
paid on the Alcides.
The Alcides sailed from this port with
one of the most valuable cargoes ever j
â  shipped from California in a sailing ves
sel. It consisted of canned goods, bar
ley, wine, salmon, beans and other mer
chandise valued at nearly half a million ;
dollars. The shipment of canned fruit j
alone was valued at $219,297, and was as i

The English markets are very poorly >
tupplied with American canned fruit,
and tho shipments of the Alcides have ,
been anxiously looked for.
Besides the canned fruit, the Alcides
carries 33,013 centals of barley, valued at
$44,000; 42.5.M4 pounds of beans, valued at
$13 000; 112 cases of canned asparagus. 320
tacks of cascara grada bark, 100 cases
of sardines, 11,203 cases of salmon and
10 000 gallons of wine. All in all, it is a ,
very valuable cargo, and no one blames
ihf" underwriters for being anxious; but
still; 40 per cent is a big price to pay in ;
order to be on the safe side. â¢
The German ship Marie Hackfeld uad ;
a very rough me of it last month, and a
-number of other vessels that were sup
posed to be in about the same latitude and
longitude as the Alcides should be suf- ,
fered in tempests, and that is about all i
there is to base the reinsurance on.

alongside chipping the iron rust off the

castaways. The tide carried the punt
down toward Alcatraz. and. there Captain

that is not often equaled even in the experience of the society. It was â¦
a tale of hard work in the house from early in the morning until late at *P
night with only kicks and cuffs, varied by beatings with a rawhide for a X

THE. SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, 8, 1899.
EFFECTS OF
PRIMARY LAW
IN POLITICS
Subject Being Widely
Discussed.
WILL TEND TOWARD PURITY.
OUTLINE OF THE MOST SALIENT
POINTS.
All Parties Will Be Compelled to
Elect Delegates to Their
Conventions at the
Same Time.
With the announcement in The Call yes
terday that it was the purpose of the
Non-Partisans to have the Stratton prim
ary law declared invalid, if it was within
the range, of possibility, discussion of that
ree'eived a fresh and marked im
petus. Politicians of all parties and of all
b took np the subject and rndeav
ored to ascertain its probahle results, so
far as the local situation Is concerned.
As a general proposition the law was
commended as being conducive to pure
politics and to the destruction of the
power of the bosses.
The law has many new and wide-reach
ing provisions, and differs radically from
the old Porter primary election law, which
it repeals. In order that the' voter may
obtain a general knowledge of this inno
vation in political matters, an outline is
herewith givtn of some of the most sa
lient features of the Stratton law, with
comment here and there to point out
wherein it differs most widely from the
practices heretofore adopted in creating
political conventions.
Should the new primary law withstand
the assaults that are already being
planned against it. it will be the first time
in the history of the United States that
primary elections are made compulsory
to preserve party organizations. This is
considered the most important feature of I
the new statute. It is made absolutely com
pulsory that delegates to party nominating
conventions be elected at primaries to
be held under regulations prescribed by
the law it' the candidates are to retain
their party designations on the ballots.
Heretofore it was at the option of the
various party organizations to hold prim
aries for the selection of delegates or to
appoint them in any manner they might
deem lit. Candidates nominated in any
other manner than by delegates electi 1
at the primary will not be entitli
their party designation on the official
ballot utt-d during the election proper.
Four kinds of primaries are provided
for. based on the political divisions of the
State. State primaries will be held for se
lecting delegates to conventions at which
public officers will be nominated for .
whom the electors of the entire State will !
vote. iMstrlct primaries will be the means
of ( noosing delegates to conventions
at which Congressmen, members of the i
Board of Equalization, Railroad Commis
sioners, Senators or Assemblymen will bo.
nominated. District primaries will be
hi Id for legislative conventions only when
the legislative district comprises" more
than one county. I,ocal primaries will be I
held for delegates to conventions to nor- J
mate candidates for county or city and
county officers, Supervisors, townshirJ
- and legislators representing riis
tricts wholly within one county. City pri
maries will be held for delegates to con- i
ventions which will nominate candidates
for city or town officers. The nominating
thus organized will be known re
spectively as State, district, local and city '.
conventions.
These primary elections are to be con
ducted, managed and controlled as to se
lection ot precinct officers, u.-r of great
registers and supplements thereto, print- i
ing and us. of ballots, ascertainment of
results, and all other details, in the same !
manner as are elections for State and all j
other officers, except as otherwise pro
vided in the law.
Only as many ballots shall be printed
for each primary election precinct as
there are names appearing on the regis
ter or the supplements thereto of persons '
entitled to vote.
No compensation is allowed to precinct
election officers, who will consist of an
Inspector, two judges, two dorks and on.?
ballot clerk for each precinct. No person
shall be compelled to serve as a prlmary
precinct election officer more than once
In two years.
All State, district and local primaries
shall be under the control of the Elec
tion Commissioners of the respective
counties, and shall be a charge on the
funds of the county. City primaries shall
be under the control, of the governing
bodies of the respective cities or towns,
and shall be a charge on the city or
town. Certificates shall be issued to the

elected delegates by the Election Com
missioners or the governing body of the
city or town.
Heretofore primaries were absolutely
controlled by the party holding them, the
precinct officers were usually paid with
political promises, all the expenses of the
primary were paid by the political or
ganization holding the same and the
whclc proceeding was generally viewed as
a farce, played to delude the honest
voter.
All political parties entitled to party
designation on the ballots for the regular !
election are to be entitled to the same j
privileges on the primary election baJlots,
after nling the proper papers with the
Secretary of State. On the governing
committees of the various political parties !
will fall the duty of apportioning- the dele
gates. Should there be any failure to j
make such apportionment by the commit
tee the power is given to the election com
missioners to do so.
State, district and local primaries are to
be held on the second Tuesday of August
of the year In which the election for
State, district or county officers is to be
held. City primaries will be held on the
sixth Tuesday next preceding the election
for city or town officers.
Fifteen days' notice by publication in a
newspaper must be given of the primary
elections.
The balloting will be on the Australian
plan. Names for delegates may be writ
ten on the primary ballot with pen or
pencil, or may be pasted upon it. Voters
can vote for as many delegates as their
party is entitled to in the precinct, but
ballots must nut be marked with the
names of delegates to more than one con
vention. Ballots which show that a voter
has marked a mixed ticket will be disre
garded. All the named marked must be
long to one party.
All persons entitled to vote at a regular
election shall be entitled to vote at the
primary. No other qualification can be
exacted. This does away with the pledge
to support the party ticket, heretofore In
vogue at primaries.
Registration of voters must be made
possible at least sixty-five days before the
â¢primary election.
A majority of the delegates chosen shall
be a quorum cf the convention.
Then to make more emphatic the com
pulsory character of the law there is this
provision, which is considered as a hard
blow at "piece clubs":
"No convention shall be recognized as
in law entitled to make nominations un
less the delegates thereto were elected
under and by virtue of the provisions of
this act. 1 '
Persons chosen to act as primary elec
tion officers who shall willfully fail or re
fuse to act shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be punished by a
fine of not less than $50 and not more than
Â£200, or by imprisonment for not less than
five days nor more than twenty days, or
by both line and imprisonment. All acts
declared to be offenses against the gen
eral election laws are made offenses
against the primary election law, with
the stme penalties attached.
Chairman A. J. Raisch of the Republi
can County Central Committee was en
thusiastic in his expectations of what the
new primary law is to accomplish in the
vviiv if purifying political methods.
"I believe ;t la a very good thiny." he j
paid, "and will tend to purify political i
practices. It will r>Â»> an incentive to every
citizen to work and vote at the primaries
with the object of having good people rep
resent them at the i onventions.
"As 1 understand this law. the primaries
of all the parties will be held at the same
time and everybody who Is qualified to
vote at all will be permitted to vote at
the primary. This will give the people the
opportunity to select the best men to rep
resent them r.t the conventions, flereto
fore the men e? acted at primaries were put
up by the political tricksters, and the
convi ntlons would be controlled by the
bosses and cliques or a few persons in the
district who were really .t disgrace to the i
people. The primary ticket would be I
made up frequently of persons who were
unknown to the decent voters of the pre
cinct, and in many cases they did not ev< n
reside in the district. Under the new law ,
all this will be changed."
Seth Mann, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee, was no less
sparing of good words for the proposed
reform.
"Alter reading the new primary law
over several times." he remarked, "I !
came to the conclusion that it la as good
a system as can be devised for the pur
if a compulsory primary election. !
! The law has been drafted in such a way
as to avoid all thf tloi s which were
; mentioned in the decision of the Supreme
Court when the Stratton primary.
law was declared Invalid. It has been
very carefully drawn and in stub a way
as to preserve all the rights of the differ- ;
ent political parties. It has passed the
close scrutiny of many able lawyers and
of many experienced and astute politi
cians. I think it would be very much to
be regretted if the Supreme Court should
for any reason decide it to be unconsti
; tutional."
"What effect will this new law have on
the local election this full?" he> was
asked.
"It must necessarily depend upon the
political activity of the citizens "of San
: Francisco, Hitherto the complaint has
been made, i id waa justified, that it was
neither pleasant nor safe for citizens to
vote at primaries, but under the protec
tion of this primary law, which provides
, for* the Australian ballot system, it will
be pÂ» fleetly saf>- for citizens to go to the
! booths and cjisU their votes for delegates
Ito the convention of their party. There
fore no public-spirited citizen can longer
have any excuse for not participating in
the primaries."
"What will he the effect on boS3 rule?"
"I think it will tend more than any
thing else." replied Mr. Mann, "to pro
duce a convention representative of the
people of the city, provided the people go
to the polls and vote. If they don't tho
results will be the same as in the past.
The only thing the Legislature can do is
to furnish the means by which the citi
zens can protect themselves against the
machinations of the bosses. If they do
not see fit to take advantage of the law
provided in such cases then they are the
only ones to blame."
Should the Btratton law remain on the
statute book the primary for the first
election under the charter will be held
August 8 and registration will begin on
June 5, or within less than three months
from this time.

PEACH CROP DEAD.
Mail advices rom New York say of the
'Top:
orts from all States except Michigan
are discouraging. Peach growers in Georgia
Fay the crop is probably entirely mined. Last
veur Georgia's output of Peaches was 2500
car.. This year. Judging from present f PP'fJ"
ances. there will not be a carload in the en
tire State Delaware growers say substantial-
Iv the =ame thinK- New Jersey is more or
ffil^S Sough it Is impossible to cay
now serious the damage is. Michigan grow
erÃiarejmore hopeful. They say their trees
will stand more cold th*n any other variety and
that in all probability the crop will be about
â, large as usual. Maryland growers are
mourning the loss of this year's crop and proh
ably Irreparable damage to the trees so
Dosltive are they that the loss Is practically
tota! that, peculators have begrun buying
,-anried peaches in Baltimore, and prices ape
ndvanc-lng California benefits most by the
freeze Canners and driers will receive much
higher prices for their products as a conse
quence .if the widespread cold.
"The consensus 01 opinion as gleaned from
leading fruit growers who visit Dover from
a ;i parts of th? State, is that the peach crop
In Delaware is dead. The leading peach
growers of this section pronounce the crop of
1599 a total failure. All agree that apples are
fill right, but pears are slightly damaged.
â¢Henry alley, the largest fruit grower in
"U't'odstock. Va.. says that his peach trees are
frozen He believes that the recent cold snap
permanently killed the majority of the peach
trees in the valley."
EASTERN DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says:
"The situation of the raisin market is com
plicated by the uncertainty as to the out
come of the mass-meeting at Fresno, Cal.,
March 1. So far as can be learned, growers
have not begun to nd in their signatures,
and unless an extraordinary change in
policy occurs at the meeting the association
will pass into tory If it does, a large
quantity of raisins will be thrown on tie
market, to be sold for whatever they will
bring and a general tumble In prices is j
likely to result. It is understood that strong \
efforts will be made to prevent such a ruinous |
policy, but it is difficult to see how it ran be !
ptopped. Sultana raisins are in small supply, 1
en<l further importation- are likely to be small.
Trices are now less than the same quality 1
could be brought from London. It is prob
able, judging from present Indications, that 1
tpot' stocks will be cleaned up in a compara- j
tlvely short time.
â â }â¢'â . are steady, under moderate demand.
No further information has been given out
regarding the proposed local combination of |
Oregon Italian interests and the proposition :
has exertc-d no influence on the market as yet. j
"here Is a moderate demand for all sizes, ,
and prices are steady at previously reported !
range
"Apricots are in firm position and scarce.
Conditions indicate that there will likely be
Improvement in prices with Improved demand, I
and occasionally one catches glimpses of what 1
that demand will result in when sales of fancy
pood? an- made at premiums over the present
quotations.
"Of all dried fruits peaches are the strong- â¢
est, and prices will tend upward. Late re
ports from the coast indicate that prices
have advanced there within a few days and .
will likely advance still further shortly. The ;
Fpot market is firmer, but no advance was j
noted Saturday, Though the majority of I
holders were confident that a further advance I
â¢would occur possibly this week. Trade is
somewhat restricted by high prices, but there
is a steady movement into consumption."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 7.â The stock market
to-day in the final dealings recovered earlier
losses and ended strong and higher than yes
terday. There was an effort on the part of the
professionals to depress prices in the early
dtaliiiK?. which was successful only tempo
rarily to a moderate extent. Investors gener
â¢ ally heiil on to their stock* and the market be
came exceptionally dull. The rate for call
money in the initial transactions touched 'â !%
per cent, with an accompanying easier tone.
Th" exchange market eased oft. with the last
lean at 2' 2 per cent, with a resultant better
tone In the general market. It was said that
because of yesterday's flurry in call money a
c^nsi'lr-rahle amount of unemployed country
bank balances was expected to be transferred
to New York this week. The dealings for
the entire day were less than half a million,
and except for the opening an/1 closing deal
ings the ticker was practically silent at in
tervals. The dealings for London account were
of small volume, with a hardening tendency
at the elope and about the best price* of the
day on the curb. Third-avenue Railroad lost
about 9 points on the public agitation against
the electric lines already on a prominent ave
nue. The grangers, pome other standard
stocks and the Pacifies were even more promi
nent on the rise than in the earlier weakness.
The anthracites, except Lackawanna and Rub
ber, were strung because of the snowstorm and'
cold weather. The forecasts of General
Electrics annual reports being favorable
strengthened that stock. A number of the
specialties, Including People's Gas, rose easily.
Reports that the Chicago and Alton was plan
ning to use Chicago Terminal facilities brought
out speculative' activity in the latter. Th"re
was much difference of opinion on the board re
garding the dividend to-morrow on Sugar with
the general expectation of the regular disburse
ment, and it closed at the best prices
Considerable firmness developed In various
spots In the bond market, but this tendency
was in a measure offset by heaviness in oth
ers. Total sales, 53.145.(X)0. United States 3's
and the old 4's registered declined V and the
new 4's H in the bid price.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 7.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were uninteresting and dull
to-day. Uneasiness was caused by fear of !

@7%; Boston, 2 3-16. _
Americans opened dull, dropped sharply be
fore noon .and then rose on small bidding for I
the coalers. New York did nothing at first. \
but finally bought a few coalers. The close
was slightly above the -worst. Central Pa- j
1 ciflcs were particularly flat.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 7.â There was a show of
strength in wheat at the opening as a result
of firmness at Liverpool on account of reported
damage to the Argentine crop. A restraining
factor was the news from California repeating
yesterday's expression of apprehension con
cerning the winter plant in that State. May
opened %@Vic higher at 72%Â®72%c and touched
72% C but then started to sag. May soon de- j
clined to 72c. When some outside buying or- 1
ders came on the market, however, it caused I
an undercurrent of apprehension concerning I
the winter wheat condition among short sellers,
and in an endeavor to buy back the wheat sold
earlier the price quickly regained the 4c from
the opening decline. Atlantic port clearances
were comparatively small. wheat and (lour
amounting to only 870,000 bushels increase for
the week, whereas a decrease of 1,500,000 bush
els had been expected. This gave the bears the
leverage they needed and the market was vig
orously attacked. May wheat declined to 71 %c,
closing at 71%@71 ! 94c, a loss of 4@%c
Corn showed moderate strength early, but
declined with wheat, closing a shad* lower.
Oats were weak and lower on account of
rather free sales by commission houses against
purchases of corn. May closed with a slight
loss.
Continued light receipts of hogs and large
shipments of meats exerted a strengthening
influence in provisions at the start. The ad
vance was all lost near the close on scattered
selling. Pork and lard are unchanged and
ribs 24c lower.

AVAILABLE GRAIN SUPPLY.
NEW YORK. March Special cable and
telegraphic dispatches to Bradstreet's indicate,
the following changes In the available sup
plies of grain last Saturday, as compared with
the preceding Saturday:
Comparatively small, wheat and flour, to
gether amounting to only 376,000 bushels. Brad
street's report of visible supply showed 3,250,
--000 bushels Increase for the week, whereas a
decrease of 1,500,000 bushels had been expected.
WHEATâ United States and Canada, east of
the Rockies, decrease 1,000.000 bushels; Corn
Trade News, afloat for and In Europe, in
crease 4.310.000 bushels. Total supply in
crease. 3,250, 000.
CORNâ United States and Canada, east of
Rockies, increase 1,257,000 bushels.
OATS- United States and Canada, east of
Rockies, Increase 425,000.
The aggregate stocks of wheat held at Port
land. Or., and Seattle and Tacoma, Wash.,
decreased 218,000 bushels during the week.
CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUITS IN THE
EAST.
NEW YORK, March 7.â The Journal of Com
merce says: While there is a good deal of ac
tivity in the market for California dried
fruits and while Stocks here are reported to be
comparatively light for the reason. New York i
Is said to be carrying larger supplies than any j
other market, and as there is reported to be
scarcely anything remaining on the coast and
that Is held at prices relatively higher than |
quotations here, the interior markets are j
' looking to New York for goods. Numerous in
quiries are being received by holders here, we
understand, from large handlers in Philadel
phia. Piltshurg and even Chicago. Not a
small part of the stock they are now anxious
to buy at full prices was, according to re
port bought from them last fall and during j
the winter by New York parties, who had ap
parently more confidence In the market than '
was shown at the time by Western operators
in these goods.
Philadelphia particularly, the report is. sold
a good deal of dried fruit to New York during
the dull season and Is now said to be trying
to buy it back and is offering full market j
prices. The out of town demand seems to be .
chietly for peaches, but there is also consid- !
erable Inquiry for apricots. Stocks of both are :
closely controlled, and holders appear to be In- i
different Fellers, being supported in their po
sition by the brisk and increasing demands of i
local consumers. While interior markets are j
coming to New York for peaches and apricots,
buyers here are said to be seeking stocks of
prunes in other cities. Of fifteen or twenty
cars bought here last week by a prominent
Jobbing house the report is, that a part of it
was purchased from Chicago firms, and it is
rumored that negotiations are pending on
other lots held in that market. The consum
ing demand for prunes, as well as other dried
fruits, excepting raisins, has shown marked
improvement during the past week and Job
bers are displaying greater interest than at
any time since the fall season closed. Car
load orders are more frequent and the bulk of ;
business is in smaller quantities. The demand I
is not of a speculative character, the stock for â 
the most part going into immediate consump
tion. Notwithstanding the increased demand, â¢
prices do not appreciably advance, though the i
market is firm and the tendency upward.

WINNING FORM
AT INGLESIDE
O'Connell the Only
Losing Choice.
YELLOV; TAIL BEATEN AGAIN
GOLDEN RULE LED FOSTER'S
CRACK OUT.
Imperious Scored Again for Pat
Dunne â Lavator Presented With
a Purse â Mary Black Cap
tured the Handicap.
Fred Foster's high-priced youngster,
Yellow Tail, again suffered defeat at In- j
pleside yesterday. He was one of eleven
starters in the three and a half furlong '
scramble for two-year-olds, and after get
ting away well was beaten through the I
ttrttch by Golden Rule. The latter, a 2 !
to 5 favorite, was knocked to his knees at
the start, by Florentii and then won com
fortably.
It was a rare good day for favorites. !
One after another thundered down the
l'.ne, until it came to the last event, when \
a halt was called. O'Connell, the vete- !
ran, an fc to 5 chance, finished third.
The defeat of O'Connell was not entirely ;
unexpected. The old horse was asked to
carry 123 pounds ana down such fast ones '
as Mary Black, Gualala and Mldllght. He |
chased Gualala for a way and then gave i
it up. Mary Black, ridden by Johnny
Keiff, and 7 and S to 1 in the betting, won I
easily from the light-weighted Good Hope.
With a capable rider on her back. Louis i
Ezell'a good filly Espionage showed to ]
much better advantage in the opening i
mile run, decided under selling conditions.
Starting a 7 to 5 favorite, with Hennessy
up, she passed Saintly before the stretch
was reached, and in a drive led Racivan
cut a head. The latter was heavily backed j
at the last minute, and though Rutter
rode a nice race on the gelding she could
not get up.
The third event, a Fix furlong sprint,
caw Lavator enjoy a cake-walk, coming
home in rag- time. The Jennings entry \
ruled an odds-on favorite, and won from
Winifred, with Spencer easing up. So- j
â  kombeo took the show.
Barney Sohrieber's Aluminum only cap- !
tured the live and a half furlong dash j
that followed by th narrowest of mar
gins. The ling, with Devln up, was an |
even money favorite, and after leading !
into the stretch just lasted long enough j
to earn the verdict from Sohnitz by a
nose. Midas beat two other cheap platers i
out for the show.
Imperious, at odds of even money, took
the seven furlong selling affair in a hard
drive from Benamela. Zamar ran a bad
â  third.

AN EARLY FIRE.
Nearly Four Thousand Dollars Worth
of Damage Done on Fourth
Street.
A fire broke out at half-past 5 o'clock ,
ve=terrtay morning in the rear of the Sun
meat market on Fourth street near .
Mission. The Fire Department had the [
flames under control in about fifteen mm- ,
utrs. but considerable damage -was done.
The butcher shop of Robert

All the buildings except that at 110
Fourth street are owned by v illiam ir

TWO NATURAL BORN FIGHTERS.
_ /-> EORGE ("KID") T^AVIGNE, the Saginaw welter-weight champion, and "Mysterious Billy" Smith, the champion of ||
O I East port, Me., will meet on Friday evening in Woodward's Pavilion to battle for the championship of the class Q
',*> I T they represent. Jim" McDonald will referee the bout. Lavigne is a slight favorite in the betting because of the Â»*
Â£ *â* fact that lie has never suffered a defeat. Smith, although a hero of many hard-fought battles, has some black &
Â§ marks on his record, or, in other words, contests which were decided against him because of his then foul style of fight- p.
;â¢ Ing. It is said, however, and on good authority, that In the last few years he has been conducting himself according to ci
<> rule and that he now finds the road to success is to be gained only by closely adhering to Queensberry requirements. Â£>
*â * The pugilists have trained most carefully for this coming contest, as both are well aware of the fact that success will *'
O. mean a great feather in the hat of the winner. .-0
Â«* Lavigne, as previously stated in The Call, has been stationed at his old favorite quarters, the Six Mile House, 2*
'&. since the day on which articles were signed. John L. Sullivan and "Jake" Kilrain were impressed with his appearance JO
88 when they visited him last week. Sullivan said that he was the greatest bit of human fighting flesh that he had ever jj?
Or seen, and predicted his success on Friday evening. jO
2$ "But, young fellow," blustered the retired champion heavy-weight, ""you must not forget that you will have a fight gi
O on your hands, because this fellow Smith is a whirlwind, and doesn't know actually when he is licked, for ho never lets <0
V up on his opponent." â¢ J?
% According to the articles of agreement, the men must weigh in at 142 pounds. Smith will not be one ounce under H
q that weight, but Lavigne expects to enter the ring at 138 pounds. He will therefore be handicapped four pounds, and Â£j
ft so far as height and reach are concerned Smith will have a great advantage, as he is five Inches taller and three inches g?
O longer in the reach. Â£l

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1899.
THE LOVE OF
A SAILOR HAS
TURNED TO HATE
Duerrbeck Courted a
Married Woman.
LAVISHED MONEY ON HER
JOSEPHINE BARTLETT'S DECEIT
GETS HER IN TROUBLE.
A Warrant Is Now Out for Her Ar
rest on a Charge of Obtaining
Money by False Pre
tenses.
That "the course of true love never j
runs smooth" has been again exempli- :
fied in the case of W. T. Duerrbeck and j
Josephine Bartlett, and instead of being i
happily married, as Duerrbeck fondly ex- j
they would bo, he has now asked '
the aid of the law to send Josephine to
San Quentin on a felony charge.
Duerrbeck is a seafaring man and lives
at 133 East street. He was of a saving
disposition and accumulated wealth. Two !
years ago he met Josephine in a dance |
hall and was attracted by her appear- |
ance. He frequented the dance hall sev- j
era! times and spent .his money lavishly â 
so that Josephine might earn a good com
mission. Finally they agreed to dwell to- '
gether and he furnished a nice home for I
her. On his return from one of his trips
he thought he had reason to be jealous
and the home was broken up and so was
the furniture.
The sailor's love for Josephine hurned |
as fiercely as ever and a reconciliation '
was effected. Josephine expressed a <I< -
sire to keep a rooming- house, as it would !
not be so lonesome for her when he was
at sea, and October 20 last he pave her ;
$450 to purchase the lodging-house at 230
O'Farrell street. She paid the money to.
Mrs. Eliza Stokes, the landlady, and took '
possession of the house.
All this time Josephine had led Duf>rr
beck to believe that she was an unmar
ried woman and would marry him when
he named the happy day. It was agreed
that after he returned from his next trip
to Alaska the marriage would take place.
He arrived a few days ago and. procur
ing the marriage license, went to 2*)
O'Farrell street and was surprised to find
that Josephine had sold out the place and
left the city.
On making inquiry he ascertained that
Josf-phine at the time he met her had a
husband. Albert E. Bartlett. He came to
the conclusion that she had swindled him
and pla'-ed the matter in the hands of his
attorneys. The result was that yesterday,
accompanied by his lawyers, he waited ;
upon Judge Mogan and swore to a com
plaint charging Josephine with a felony
In obtaining money by false pretenses.
Altogether he said hn had squandered !
about $4000 on Josephine and her whims.
The woman In the case is at present in j
Ran Jose and the warrant was sent to |
Chief Kidward with instructions to arrest !
her As soon as she is apprehended a de- |
tective will be sent to bring her back to
the city.
Not the Murderer.
LoulÂ© Lung, the Chinese arrested Mon- \
day by Detectives Wren and McMahon
on suspicion of having kicked to death
Quong Guey, the slave girl, at 23Mj Ross
alley, was released from custody yester
day morning. Louie was able to prove
conclusively that he had nothing to do
with the murder and had never been in
hiding, as was alleged.
PARDON' FOR JOHNSON.
Effort Being Maae on Behalf of a
Convicted Counterfeiter.
A petition is in circulation asking the
Governor to pardon Thomas Johnson, now
serving a seven years' sentence in the
San Quentin Penitentiary for count
ing. ? Johnson has already served two
years or his sentence. It is represented
that he has a wife and two young chil
dren dependent upon him for support;
that the crime of which he was convict
ed was his first offense and that he has
been already sufficiently punished.
Ex-Assistant United States Attorney
Schlesinger prosecuted Johnson and has
signed the petition. It will be presented
to United States Circuit Judge Morrow
for his signature to-day.
Double Tracks to Holy Cross.
Superintendent Clayton of the San
Francisco and San Mateo Electric Rail
way Company broke ground yesterday on
Dolores and Chenery streets preparatory
to laying a double track from Thirtieth
and Guerrero streets to Holy Cross Ceme
tery. The company has but recently fin
ished laying a double track on its Eigh
teenth-street western branch leading to
Golden Gate Park.
The Holy Cross line will be constructed
very substantially, and the company will
hurry the rebuilding of the long line
through the two counties, and may event
ually go direct to the town ot Sun Mateo
via Baden.

! SOME FACTS REGARDING THE RAPID
', INCREASE OP HEART TROUBLES.
âº _
! Do Not Be Alarmed, but Look for
> the Cause.
| Heart troubles, at least among the
â  j Americans, are certainly increasing, and
I I while this may be largely due to the ex-
I citement and worry of American busi-
| ness life it is more often the result of
weak stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real organic disease is Incurable; but
not one case in a hundred of heart
trouble Is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nerves,
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way also the heart is affect-
ed by the form of poor digestion, which
causes gas and fermentation from half-
digested food. There is a feeling of op-
pression and heaviness in the chest,
caused by pressure of the distended stom-
ach on the heart and lungs, lnterefering'
with their action; hence arises palpita-
tion and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble is to improve the digestion and
I to insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use
i after meals of some safe, pleasant and
i effective digestive preparation, like Stu-
I art's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be
found at most drugstores and which con-
tain valuable, harmless digestive elements
in a pleasant, convenient form.
It is safe to say that the regular per- 'â¢
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspspsia Tablets
at meal time will cure any form of stom-
ach trouble except cancer of the stomach.
Full sized packages of these tablets sold
by druggists at 50 cents. Little book on ,
stomach troubles mailed free. Address F. ,

SOLID SIX
MAY YET BE
A-SCHEMING
Its Low Ordinance Is
Not Favored.
WAITING FINAL PASSAGE
ITPTON'S FIGURES MAY NOT
BE ACCEPTED.
After the Election Some of the Pres
ent Peculiarities May Be Made
Clear â Doubt of Good
Faith.
Oakland Office* San Francisco Call,
Broadway, 7.
Will the "Solid Six" remain dieinteg- j
rated when the water rate ordinance
come? up for final passage, or are they
merely "playing 'possum" until after the
election to hoip out the only two of their
number who are candidates for re-elec
(Vatkinson and Woodward? A com- j
parlson of the ordinance passed to print j
last night by the Council with the ordi- |
nance introduced by Mr. Earl and the old
ordinance prepared by ex-Councilman
Manuel shows that Earl and Manuel agree
In every particular. In fact, Mr. Earl, for
reasons best known to himself, merely
copied 0â¢â  old Manuel ordinance and j
handed it in to the Council. Mr. Upton's j
ordinance, which was. passed, is far more
generous to ;he water company than that
of the Juanuel-Eurl ordinance, but the I
gentlemen who framed it declare that it j
is only |ust to the corporation and not
too high. Four years ago. when Manuel j
was in the Council, representing the same ;
element that is now being represented by [
the consistent five Councilmenâ Cuvellier,
Upton, Bowe, Girard and Pringleâ he pre- \
pared his ordinance after much research. |
There was at that time a desire to run j
things to extremes, and the ordinance |
would not have paid any dividends on j
Btock had it been in force. This has been i
true although the ordinance was never en
forced, rate-cutting commencing between
the rival companies soon after its passage.
Ten days must elapse before the ordi
nance comes up for final passage. Last
night three members of the "six" went
to the other side and sustained I pton s
ordinance. Earl, Watkinson and Broana
han alone voted for the Manuel-Earl or
dinance which is about one-half or per- I
haps one-third of the schedule favored
by those three gentlemen last year. In
the interval the election will take place,
and after that all members of the Council
will breathe more freely and feel more
comfortable. . I
Just what part the water monopoly is
taking in the fixing of rates and in the i
present campaign is not very clear. While
there is a need of a high rate to enable if|
to float the newly issued bonds and stock,
there is no desire to give the business a
black eye in the money market by raising ,
a riot on account of "dealing" with the
City Council. With the two companies
United, operating expenses will be largely
reduced, and it would seem that a lower
rate could therefore be levied. The situa- j
tion just now is ludicrous. The men cred-
Ited with being tied to the corporation
have introduced figures considerably lower
than those of the other element In the
Council, and yet the figures of Mr. Earl ,
are precisely those of the predecessors
In the Council of "the five. The ordinance
wfll come up for final passage in two
weeks, and then it will be seen what kind
of a trickâ if a trick at allâ the Solid {
Bix" is trying to perform.
CONDUCTOR PELTON
KILLED BY A TRAIN
STEPS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A
LOCOMOTIVE.
He Is Badly Crushed and Dies WhilÂ»
Being Removed to tho<Fabiola
Hospital.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, March 7.
George E. Pelton, a conductor on the
/laywards local train, was si ruck by the j
engine of the Oakland ' local at Brooklyn;
station at 9:iJO this morning and so badly
Injured that he died while being removed I
to the Fabiola Hospital. Pelton left his j
home at 1418 Eignth avenue a few mm- i
uus after 9 o'clock, intending to catch the j
9:30 train to the pier. As the train pulled ,
into the station Pelton. for some reason :
that can be explained only on the theory j
of absent-mindedness, stepped out on the
track directly in front of the advancing ,
engine. He was struck by the cylinder of
the locomotive and knocked down, falling
beneath the steps of the forward coach. '
He was picked up in an unconscious con
dition badly crushed about the body and
Euffering from a number of severe bruises ,
about the head. The unfortunate man i
was put aboard the train and taken to the j
Broadway station, where an ambulance ]
from Fabiola Hospital was in waiting, but
expired while en route to that institution \
and the remains were taken to the I
morgue.
Deceased had been employed by the I
Southern Pacific Company most of the
time as a conductor for fifteen years, and
was regarded as one of its most trusted
employes. He was extremely popular j
with the patrons of the road, and his un
timely death will be deeply regretted. He â 
was 49 years old and leaves h lamily con
sisting of a widow, mother, a daughter
13 years old and a widowed daughter with
a little child. He was a member of the
Brotherhood of Railway Conductors,
which organization will have charge of
the funeral arrangements. The remains
will be interred in the family plat In Mon
terey.
Coroner Mehrmann and a jury Inquired
into Pelton's death to-night, and found
a verdict of accidental death. The jury
also exonerated from all blame the crew I
of the Seventh-street local, which struck
Pelton. Deceased was a native of Wis
consin, aged 49 year?.
DEMOLISHED THE FURNITURE
James Gregory Wrecks His Homa
Witn an Ax.
OAKLAND, March 7â James Gregory,
an upholsterer, residing at 1647 Market
street, had a dispute with his wife this
morning anl proceeded to get even by j
demolishing his household effects with an
ax. Mrs. Gregory escaped from the house
while the work of demolition was going
cm and rushing to the City Hall swore
to a complaint charging her husband with
disturbing the peace. When Officer Cur
rlss arrived on the scene with the war
rant Gregory had barricaded the doors
and locked himself in the basement. The
officer finally forced an entrance, but
Gregory fled through the back door and
tried to escape. He was overhauled after
an exciting chase over fences and through
the gardens of neighbors and then
showed fight, but was quickly subdued.
Every stick of furniture in the house had
been reduced to kindling wood. Kren the
family album had been hacked to pieces
by the enraged man. Gregory was re
cently arrested on a charge of drunken
ness and judgment was suspended during
his good behavior. He will probably be
severely dealt with for his latest out
break.

DEMOCRACY
IS WONDERING
WHERE IT IS
Is Repudiated by Its
Own Organ.
CAPTAIN HACKETT MOVES
A SECRET CONVENTION STIRS
UP MUCH INTEREST.
Auditor Snow Returns to the City
and Will Attend Personally
to His Campaign for
i- Mayor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 7.
Oakland has never had such a campaign
as she Is now enduring. Never before hai.
everything been so completely mixed up
and party lines po far stretched. The most
interesting row is among the Democracy.
This party, which has generally been in
the minority, does not quite know where
it is Without Its knowledge a few of its
leaders put up a proposition several
months ago to indorse the candidates of
the Municipal League, provided that some
of the candidates were Democrats. The
league met, and being more anxious for
Republican support than Democratic sup
port it nominated none but Republicans.
The Democrats started out to make a
campaign for themselves and found to
their sorrow that the only Democratic or
gan around the bay was against them.
It had decided to support the Republican
ticket, and but for the kindly feeling of a
local newspaper the Democracy might
have made a campaign and no one have
been the wiser. Not only has their organ
served the Democracy with notice that it
can expect no favors but it Is ignoring
iht-m entirely, and although Beth Mann,
chairman of the State Central Democratic
Committee, and Hon. W. W. Foote have
taken part in the campaign their names
have neyer appeared in the party's organ.
After declaring tnat he would not make
any kind of a light for the office of City
Auditor, Captain Ed Hackett, the Demo
cratic nominee, has changed his mind and
he started oui to-day to decorate the town
-with red and black posters. This has add
ed interest to th<- contest for this office.
A. H. Breed, the Republican nominee,
will draw the full vote of his party, while
D. C. Hinsdale will share the balance of
the vote with Captain Hackett.
Much curiosity has been shown regard
ing a secret convention which was held
on the l^th of February at Hamilton Hall.
It has been generally understood that no
issues outside of purely political ones
should be brought into this campaign, and
the candidates are anxiously working to
discover, if possible, what was done, at
â ret conclave.
R. W. Snow, the Republican nominee
for Mayor, is now actively conducting his
own campaign. He reports the outlook
as being very favorable to the whole He
publican ticket, and expects to see a
sweeping victory next Monday.
SECRET MARRIAGES ARE
IN VOGUE IN ALAMEDA
LUCY O'BRIEN ASTOUNDS HER
FRIENDS.
She Was Wedded Last November in
a Romantic Manner and Now
Confesses the Fact.
ALAMEDA, March 7.â Alameda is de
veloping a wealth of clandestine mar- \
riag-es. Following close upon the heels of
the Shane-Homeier romance comes an
other love affair, ending in a wedding in
which James Connely of Petaluma and
Miss Lucy O'Brien of this city were the
principal figures.
Connely has been paying court to Miss
O'Brien for nearly a year, but the mother
of the young lady objected to the Peta
luman as a son-in-law and forbade him to
visit the O'Brien home. However, early
last November the couple met in San
Francisco by appointment and were mar
ried by a Justice of the Peace. The bride
returned to her Alameda home and kept
her secret. A few days ago the husband
secured employment at the Presidio in j
San Francisco and sent word to his wife
that he was prepared to provide for her, i
and suggested that it was about time that j
she should place herself under his pro
tecting care.
Without consulting her mother the ;
young lady packed a few of her belong
ings and joined her husband. As soon as
Mrs. O'Brien discovered her daughter' a
absence she jump'-'i at th>- conclusion that
there had been an elopement in the fam- :
ily and did everything she could to appre
hend the runaway. .Later Mrs. O'Brien re- |
ceived a letter from the young lady di
vulging the secret wedding and stating
that she and her husband were living to
gether happily in San Francisco. Mrs.
O'Brien has not yet recovered from the
shock.
This is not the first experience of the
kind in the O'Brien family. All of the
daughtersâ three in number â have sur
rounded their matrimonial affairs with a
tinge of romance. One eloped to Los An
geles, where she subsequently died. An
other, who was a teacher in the Alameda
public schools, was secretly married to a
commercial traveler from Oregon. She
continued teaching until she was forced
to resign her position, when her marriage
announcement was published. Pubs>-
quently she joined her husband and is now
living in the East. Miss Lucy's escapade
makes the career of the young ladies
completely and truly romantic.
Said He Was Held Up.
OAKLAND, March 7.â John Wood of
East Oakland reported to the police "to
night that he was held up by two well
dressed strangers near Twelfth and
Oak streets about 10 o'clock and relieved
of $60 in gold. He had on his person also
three watches, which the footpads did not
disturb. The police are inclined to dis
credit Wood's story.

OF AN ACCUSED
MURDERESS
Sensation Sprung in
Mrs. Brandes' Case.
CHARGES BY HER ATTORNEY
SAWYER AVERS THAT OFFICERS
ASKED HER QUESTIONS.
William A. Brandes' Trial Delayed
Through the Sudden Illness
of One of the Jurors,
Philip Sieben.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 7.
Attorney F. W. Sawyer endeavored to
create a sensation in Judge Hall's depart
ment to-day, when Mrs. Etta Brandes,
charged with murder, appeared to have |
i her ca.se continued another week on ac- i
j count of the trial of her husband, Wil- |
I liam A. Brandes, occupying the court's j
I attention.
Attorney Sawyer, addressing Judge
; Hall, stated that since the adjournment j
in Brandes' trial last Friday it had come
to his knowledge that two officers had ap-
I proached Mrs. Brandes in the County
j Jail and had attempted to extort ad
i missions from her, notwithstanding she
I had been advised by her attorneys not j
!to be Interviewed. He said that these offl- j
cers represented that they were author
ized to do so by the court, and he asked
j Judge* Hall to protect his client from such ;
; unfair methods.
The statement created a considerable |
stir momentarily. Judge Hall expressed \
surprise, and assured Mr. Sawyer that he
bad authorized no une to ask Mrs. j
Brandes any questions, and moreover i
that he would In no case do so.
Sawyer subsequently stated that Police
man Bert Curtis and Deputy Sheriff
George V. Taylor had invaded Mrs.
Brandes' cell, insisting that she an
swer questions as to her age, nativity,
the date of her marriage and even her ;
i weight. "The officers threatened," con
tinued Sawyer, "that they would find a I
way to compel her to answer if she re- j
fused." Mrs. Brandes emphatically re
fused to answer any of the questions.
George Taylor is also assistant jailer, ]
and when questioned by a Call reporter |
easily explained Sawyer's charges. He
seemed greatly amused over the accusa
tions.
"1 have to admit," said Taylor, "that '
we went to Mrs. Brandes' celL We did !
i ask her the questions, but it was abso
lutely in our line of duty. We were seek-
I ing information for the rogue's gallery,
i We wished to get an accurate descrip
tion of the prisoner for our records. It is
an absurd hulabaloo to suppose that we
1 had any thought of using such informa
tion at the woman's trial."
Mrs. Brandes' case was continued for
i another week, and then the trial of her j
â  accused husband was resumed, the de- |
â  ailing to the stand Dr. A. H. l'rutt
ias a medical expert, whose testimony
! briefly -was to the effect that evidences
lof hanging in the way of superlicial
marks about the neck are not prominent
in cases of young persons where the liga
ture is removed soon after death.
j Though blood- oozed thirty-one hours af- I
! ter death and a parchment skin appeared
, on the neck, the expert thought, these
would not necessarily indicate hanging.
In reply to a question put by Juror i
i Sieben Dr. Pratt admitted that author
i ities on evidences of hanging are so con
tradictory that there is no accounting for
them.
on cross-examination Dr. Pratt testi- :
: fled that there were adhesions and mi
i flammation in the dura mater of Lillian >
> Brandes that were abnormal. As to me
mark on tin dead girl's neck, witness said
It might have been made by the apron In
evidence, provide. i it was twisted into a
very firm condition, such as a rope.
The trial was here brought to a sudden |
termination for the day by reason of one :
of- the jurors. Philip Sieben, being taken '
sick. Sieben, who resides in Alameda, |
had been ill this morning when he came
: over. He .suffered from flfzzlness and a
rushing of blood to the head, and his nose
began bleeding profusely. Accordingly )
court adjourned until 0:30 to-morrow
morning. _^_____ - __ ââ _

President Harper's Visit â Lieutenant
Hayne No Longer Exploring the
Philippines.
'BERKELEY, March 7.â Dr. William T.
Harper, president of the University of
Chicago, who has accepted an Invitation
to deliver the public address at the uni
versity Charter day celebration on March
23, will arrive in Berkeley Tuesday, March
21. It is expected that his visit to the
coast will not extend over seven days.
As far as can be learned now he intends
to divide his time between California and
Stanford. On Wednesday before Char
ter day he will deliver a public address be
fore the whole student body. On Charter
day, after speaking at the commemora
tion exercises by Founders' Rock, on the
college campus, he is to be the guest of
honor at a university banquet to be
given the same evening in San Fran
cisco. Friday morning the distinguished
visitor will go to Stanford, returning
to Oakland in time to address a large
public gathering there Sunday after
noon.
A committee consisting of William T
Mooney of California and R. A. Leiter of
Stanford have made the final arrange
ments for the next intercollegiate debate
The contest Itself is to come off In Met
ropolitan Temple, San Francisco, on the
night of April 22. Both colleges have
agree.d upon the following subject for dis
cussion: "Resolved, That the retention
of the Philippines is contrary to the prin
ciples for which this Government should
stand." Stanford has chosen the afllrm
ati%'e of the question, leaving the nega
tive to California.
The senior class, which graduates next
May, has petitioned the Board of Re
gents to refund $5 of the amount which
each member was required to deposit on
entering college for the customary dl
ploma fee. Previously the fee was $10,
but since 1897 the board has reduced the
sum by one-half. A similar petition was
presented by the class graduating last
year, and being granted by the regents,
each member way returned half the
amount originally deposfted. The pres
ent class expects the same favorable an
swer to their request, and part of the
sum, if obtained may go toward defray
ing the expenses for class day exercises
at the close of the term.
Miss Berg, Miss Rothermel, Miss Lulu
Simpson, Earl Swan and Roscoe Logan
have been appointed a committee to ar
range for a senior reception to be given
on Wednesday evening, March 15.
A letter has been received from Lieu
tenant Arthur P. Hayne. formerly of the
agricultural department of the unner
sity but now in active service in Ma
nila, stating that his work as agricul
tural expert for the Government had
been suspended temporarily. Lieutenant
Hayne was detached from the regular
army by orders from Washington and
commissioned to conduct an exploration
over the Philippines for the purpose of
forwarding a detailed report to the Bu
reau of Agriculture at Washington. The
work progressed very favorably for a
time, but the attitude' of the natives grew
so hostile that no further progress could
be gained. It was decided to suspend ex
ploration for the time being, and Lioulen
ant Hayne is now aid on the staff of Gen
eral Anderson.

INGLESIDE'S DOOM
Supervisors Universally Praised for
Their Action.
EVIL BOAST OF THE GAMBLERS.
They Prepare to Concentrate the Crime Breeding
Influences at Emeryvilleâ A Secret Compact
Between Corrigan and the Oakland
Manipulators.
The action of the Supervisors In tak
ing the preliminary step toward placing
an absolute prohibition upon book
making and pool selling in this city has
won an almost universal tribute of
praise and commendation from those
who have the welfare of San Francisco
at h^art. The evil of Ingleside had
grown to such appalling proportions
that the citizens of this city dreaded
that reform was impossible. Clergy
men had preached in vain against the
curse of the race course. Police offi
cials had reached that stage where they
VT r^ powerless to do anything more
than record the tragedy of lives
wrecked by the racetrack. Merchants
â a-ere forced to suspect their most trust
ed employes and to employ detectives
to shadow men and women that before
had been above suspicion.
The records of the State penitentiaries
were telling new stories of crime con
ceived at the racetrack. The Morgue
found many a suicide led to self de
struction by the allurements of the
bookmakers. Homes were being
wrecked and the private detectives of
the city were reaping a harvest in the
shame of those who had fallen beneath
the seduction of the poolsellers. When
there seemed no possibility of remedy
the Supervisors stepped in and placed
an abs-.lute ban upon the degenerate
eport that has thrived at Ingleside.
The action of the board taken on
Monday afternoon was the topic yester
day of general comment. Lawyers dis
cussed the possibility that too drastic
a measure had been adopted and the
gamblers might call into question the
constitutionality of the new municipal
ordinance. Merchants and business
men were unanimous in their opinion
that the first step in reform had been
well taken and that the people of the
city, irrespective of class or occupation,
will give unqualified support to the
Supervisors in their crusade against
the great evil.
Thf-re is reason to believe that the
prohibitive ordinance was not alto
pether a surprise to the gamblers of
the racecourse. Ed Corrigan and his
fellows tried their game elsewhere be
fore they began operations in this city.
They thrived in Chicago until the ruin
they brought in their tracks compelled
the authorities of that city to expel
them and stop their crime-breeding
practices. Men and women had been
dishonored and a legitimate and royal
pport had been sacrificed to their greed.
They had existed as legalized agencies
of crime and The people of Chicago re
belled. The "Master of Hawthorne"
was forced to seek a new field for his
manipulations and he chose San Fran
cisco.
Certain members of the army of gam
blers that followed Corrigan's lead have
be<=n indiscreet enough to boast *hat
they had paid for municipal protection
against adverse laws. These men knew
as well as any one could tell them that
they were debauching an honest sport,
but" they claimed that they had pur
chased immunity from official interfer
ence. The race course was given over
to the gamblers, and the black record
which The Call has published was the
result for the people of San Francisco.
When the race course gamblers made
their boast that they had given coin
for protection, they also declared that
they had, by agreement, protected
themselves from any interference with
their scheming traffic. While they were
disturbed they were not surprised
at the action taken on Monday by the
Board of Supervisors. Corrigan and
his fellows have anticipated in this city
the rebellion that was created by their
operations in Chicago.
In anticipation of the inevitable
end of their manipulation in this
city, the gamblers of Ingleside have
united with the gamblers of Emery
ville in a scheme for mutual protec
tion. Very early in the history of the
great evil of Ingleside a compact of
importance was made between Corri
gan and the gamblers of the Oakland
track. In substance this compact
provided that in the event of acci
dent to either track the managers of
the other would extend every possi
ble privilege and courtesy to their
associates. This simply means that
if the authorities of San Francisco
crushed out the race track cvii in this
city the gamblers of Ingleside would
be welcomed with their horses at
Emeryville.
The schemers of the local track are
now boasting of the existence of this
contract. They allege thai they have
in the past bought, the protection of
Boards of Supervisors, but they will do
nothing now to prevf-nt the full ff/rce
of the legislation which has received
every commendation except their own.
They say that they will go to Emery
ville and concentrate their vicious sport
on the Oakland track. If this threat
is carried out, and from the develop
ments of yesterday it seems less a
threat than an unwelcome alternative
of the gamblers, San Francisco will be
freed from the greatest evil that ever
visited the city.
The members of the Board of Super
visors who voted to abolish brrokmak
ing and pool-selling took their ac
tion after full deliberation. They
saw no reasonable way of tem
porizing with the evil and decided
to kill It They will stand by their po
sition next Monday and will complete
the legislation that means the end of
Ingleside. The Supervisors believe that
Oorrlgan and his associates had car
ried their Chicago practice? to such a ;
pass at Ingleside that annihilation was |
the only remedy that would prove ade- j
quate to destroy the evil. The gamblers
will have to go elsewhere, therefore,
whether they care to do bo or not. If
they so to Emeryville they will remain
a crime-creating influence in the State i
until a legislative enactment drives j
them out.
The conditions which the gamblers
| have created at Ingleside are matters
of sincere regret to legitimate sports
men of the State, but they say that
they would rather see the prohibition
of a sport than its prostitution by
blacklegs. These sportsmen are
heartily in sympathy, therefore, with
the new ordinance.
They discussed with some interest :
yesterday the possible legal aspects of j
the case.
Lawyers who were interviewed ;
are unanimous in the opinion that the '
new ordinance prohibiting bookmak
ing and poolselling is constitutional
and will pass the test of the Supreme ;
Court. The Board of Supervisors pos
sesses what is known as police power
and is privileged to exercise that power
as long as all enactments are general
in character. The prohibitory ordin- ,
ance. which was passed to print on
Monday, Is general, prohibiting, as it
does, all bookmaking and poolselling
within the limits of the city and county
of San Francisco. The ordinance in
no way is special or partial. It is ex- :
pected, therefore, to bear the test of j
the courts if it be called into question
by the gamblers.
The manipulators of the race
course will have to move therefore
from Ingleside to Oakland. There
will be no profit, as there has been
no sport, in racing without the dis
honest adjunct of the books. Ingle
side's terrifying brood will migrate
to Emeryville, where, under existing
laws, it may still thrive to corrupt
the people of Oakland, and indirectly
those of San Francisco.
It will be remembered that Moses
Gunst, Dan Burns and their crew
made Emeryville an incorporated
town of the sixth class. Hostlers,
rubbers, touts, jockeys, gamblers and
men known best as loafers con
tributed the carpet-bag votes that
made Emeryville a pleader for mv- j
nicipal privileges, and a subservient
Board of Supervisors of Alameda did
the rest. Emeryville is consequently
free from the jurisdiction of the au
thorities of Oakland or the County of
Alameda.
The gamblers make the laws to
suit themselves. They have a town in
a race track. If they keep their con
tract with Corrigan they will wel
come the blacklegs that the Super
visors are driving from this city and
protect in one great vicious nest the
men whom Chicago would not toler
ate, and against whom the people of
San Francisco, in self-protection,
have rebelled. This condition of af
fairs cannot be disturbed except by
an enactment of the State Legisla
ture. It is, perhaps, significant that
Corrigan has found it necessary to :
go to Sacramento.
As already indicated, the Super
visors were rewarded yesterday for
their action by general commenda
tion. Clergymen, police authorities,
merchants, business men, lawyers,
sportsmen were a unit in praising
the men who had courage enough to
attack the evil of Ingleside. Repre
sentatives of every class in the com
munity were eager to give unquali
fied indorsement to the action of the
Board of Supervisors. It had been
claimed by the gamblers that at least
one class in the community, that of
i the liquor dealers, would indorse no
restrictive measure against the race
course. To show the falsity of this
claim the following interviews are
subjoined:
FRED MULLER, wholesale wine
dealer â The races as now conducted are
a great evil to this city, both morally
and in a business way. As an illustra
tion, I have patrons who do a good
business and ought to be prosperous,
but they play the ponies, and the result
is that I cannot collect from them, and
in more than one case I know that they
are not able at present to pay their
rent. The game which was once a
royal sport has degenerated into a plain
gambling proposition and ought to be
stopped. It is a ruinous combination at
the least.
HERMAN DENHARD, wholesale li
quor dealer â I do not believe in prohib
iting horse racing, but I do think it
ought to be. restricted to a term of i
three or four months. The present Biz
months' arrangement is all wrong.
JOHN F. WITZELL, commission j
merchant â Clean, honest horse racing j
is all right, but the gambling feature I
that has developed so rapidly in the j
past few years should be stopped, if it
can be done. It is ruinous to our young
men and it seems that the women are
becoming fascinated with the game.
RICHARD UHTE, retail liquor dealer
âThe gambling feature ought to he
stopped. Business men as well as
clerks are going wrong by reason of it,
and I do not see why the temptation
should be placed before them. There is
no other place in the world where this
wide open six months' game would be
allowed. It should be restricted to <I<=an
sport and confined to not more than
two months.

its insidious way, is in a degree as bad.
I say stop all this kind of gambling or

J. D. FLOYD, retail liquor dealerâ
I do not believe in interfering with
the vested rights of the people, but
the way house-racing is conducted
in this city and Oakland is dis
graceful. It ruins our young men
and makes thieves of those who
would otherwise lead honest lives.
Another feature of the proposition is
the fact that there Is many a hard
working man who, when he goes to his
business, does not know whether his
wife will go to the races or coursing,
or stay at home and care for her
family.
CHARLES BUNDSCHU. wholesale

to this poolselling vice and in connec

The game demoralizes our youth, is a
disgrace to the city and gives us noth
ing in return. Let it be made a clean
sport and restricted, or suppressed en

clined to be quoted, said: "The races

O II Big, burly Edward Lennon
â¦ "^ tossed the little prattler high
9. above his head, and with a kiss all

O the Cliff House with his friend, A.

Â° their well-earned day of rest in surf

? Less than an hour later an Italian
7^ crab fisher drew the lifeless body of
Â° Lennon into his boat from the ocean
"*" and conveyed it to the Morgue.
9 Lennon was a motorrrian on â¢ the

to see their finish. Not alone this, but
I know of my own knowledge that
young hoys and girls pool their nickels
and dimes and quarters and buy pools
on the races. It is an outrage that
such temptations should be tolerated
and it is the duty of the Supervisors
to not only stop the poolselling, but
lo materially shorten the period in
which races can be h^ld. It is not
sport now; it is a plain, raw gamble:"
A BRUTAL ATTACK.
Corrigan Grossly Insults a Bace-
Goer and Escapes Punishment.
That Ed Corrigan, the "White Czar"
of Ingleside, still lives is perhaps a mir
acle. When the stern-visaged veteran
of a hundred brawls spat in the face of
a race-goer at Ingleside track yester
day, he took his life in his hands and
did not know it. As usual, he escaped
unscathed, by the help of a PinJcerton
detective, his old ally.
The occurrence mentioned happened
between the second and third races. A
gambler from Oakland, who refused to
rock at the bottom that projected out
of the water six or eight feet at low
tide, from this rock they could easily
jump to another farther out, and there
almost directly underneath the north
west corner of the Cliff House they
usually cast their linos.
The water was low when they
reached the ledge yesterday morning,
and the lazy breakers rolling in were
contemptuously small. After watch-
Ing them a few minutes to see that
they did not wash over the rock, Len
non said it was "all right," and scram
bled down the cliff, calling to his com
panion to follow him. Preston did so,
and Lennon soon reached the first
rock.
Without thought, of danger, he
jumped across to the second. At the
same instant a billow, much larger
than any of the preceding ones, rolled
in. washing over the outer rock and
knocking Lennon off his feet. Before_
he could regain an upright position a
second and still larger breaker swept
over the rock, and when it receded it
carried poor, struggling Lennon out
toward Seal Rocks.
Preston sought by every means in
his power to save his comrade, and
several attaches of the Cliff House
hurried' to the rescue with a life buoy,
but Lennon was far beyond their
reach.

with "Red," the busy paddock runner
and information gleaner employed by
Barney Schrelber. Turning around,
with an oath, the exile of Cicero sput
squarely in the face of the stranger,
no doubt thinking he was playing the
eavesdropping act. In an instant the
man from across the bay, an individual
i.f small stature, with blue eyes and a
blonde mustache, asked his herculean
assailant what he meant, at the same
time starting to remove his coat. Before
he could commence the attack a Pin

soon everything was as dull and list

A WELL PLANNED ROBBERY
BURGLARS' VISIT DISCOVERED
BY MEREST ACCIDENT.
Police Carefully. Investigate the
Premises, but Find No Trace
of the Bold and Clever
Criminals.
A representative of Bibo, Newman &
Ikanberg, the well-known grocers at the
southwest corner of Polk and California
streets, visited the Chief of Police otnee
last night and reported that burglars nave
been visiting the establishment during
the past three nights and carried away
many hundreds of dollars in groceries.
The thieves gained an entrance to the
cellar by breaking down an obstruction
between the grocery firm's premises and
those next door. Once in, their opera
tions were easy. Although a watchman
was overhead, their work went on un
noticed and might have continued but
for a discovery made by one of the c'.erks
in the store yesterday. He felt a. draught
and began to search for its cause and
discovered a number of auger holes un
der the counter, which the burglars had
evidently made to throw light into the
cellnr. Further investigation developed
the fact that the boards separating the
two cellars had heen removed and a
quantity of goods stolen.
The visit was evidently well planned,
and way made by persons familiar with
the peculiar formation of the cellars in
that vicinity. It is .said it is possible to
walk through the adjoining basements
without meeting any obstructions.
Detective Egan was detailed on the
case and visited the store last evening to
investigate.
The nrm Is unable to give the police a
list of the articles taken, as there are
thousands of dollars" worth of goods
stored in the cellar. They, however, con
sider themselves particularly fortunate

SUDDEN DEATH.
Saloon-Keeper Cassidy's Spree Came
to a Fatal Ending After Nine
Months.
M. J. Cassldy, a saloon-keeper at 613
Mission street, was found dead in bed
yesterday morning in the room which he
had occupied as a bed-chamber back of
the saloon. William Owens sleeps in the
same building and was accustomed to
awaken Cassidy every morning. Hearing
no response to his knock he forced the
door open und found Cassldy dead.
The deceased was a native of Ennis
killen, Ireland, 45 years old. He had been
in robust health, but had been drinking
to excess for the past nine months. The
indications are that alcoholism was the
cause of death.
DBIVEN TO STEAL.
An Ex-Soldier, Desperate by Destitu
tion, Carries Off a 801 lof Wire.
George Brown, an ex-Tennessee soldier,
was arrested early yesterday morning
while in the act of carrying away a roll
of copper wire from the Edison electric
power house on Stevenson street, near
Third. He stated to Superintendent Pool
of the company that he was destitute and
left his wife at home without a particle
of food in the house to eat. He claims to
have arrived in Nashville, Term., from
New York, his native place, just at thÂ«
time the regiment was recruiting for its
d( parture for this coast, and enlisted. He
was discharged here and was married.
For a while all went well, but bad luck
overtook him. and he was soon penniless.
His story impressed Superintendent Pool.
who instructed Attorneys Wheeler and
Williams for the company to ask for an
acquittal, believing that Brown was lm
pelled by his desperate poverty to commit
the crime. Judge Graham continued the
case till to-day, a preliminary to discharg
ing the prisoner.
An Early Pioneer Dead.
Thomas Stealey, a California pioneer,
was buried yesterday from his residence,
3491 Seventeenth street. He arrived in
this city in tho latter part of 1549. via the
isthmus, a passenger from Panama in the
old bark Caucasia. He made a fortune in
the Frazier River mines and returned to
San Francisco, where, in May. 1860, he
married Miss Mary 1.. Saunders, a de
scendant of tho Washington family. Mrs.
Stealey and right children survive him.
