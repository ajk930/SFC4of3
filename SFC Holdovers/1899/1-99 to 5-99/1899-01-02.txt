, MENTO, Jan. I.â The temptation to go
after the big sum of 000.000 now
' stored In the State treasury is hard
for the lawmaker to resist. The first
â  dash for the coin was made in the As
sembly caucus to-night in behalf of the
State printing office. The caucus was
quickly organized by the election of
"â¢ Henry C. Dibble permanent chairman.
The fact that he had no opposition'
' lends color to the statement .that the |
â  Republicans are will!- at the outset
to endow him with the laurels of lead
ership in the Assembly.
Immediately after the caucus organ
â¢. Jzed a motion was made .hat the As
sembly pass under suspension of the
rules and the previous question a meas
ure appropriating a Bum in excess of
, a quarter of a million dollars to open
the State printing office. The magni
tude .of the proposed appropriation
startled the conservative legislators,
"who are not familiar with the coin ab
sorbing peculiarities of this particular
State institution. The proposition met

&c large allowance and supported his
motion with tact and eloquence.
The caucus was not carried away.
5 however, by his arguments, and BO a
compromise measure was suggested,
which provided an immediate allow- ;
ance of $100,000 for '} c printing office. |
â¢ A -ill. therefore, sanctioned by the Re- j
publican Assembly and appropriating]
.this Bum of money, will probably be
the first measure to pass the Legisla
. ture and go to Governor Gage for his
' approval. The supporters of the larger j
Bum contented themselves with the re
flection that $100,000 would last the
State Printer a little while. When this
amount vanishes another reach will be
made. Fearing that the taxpayers
might become alarmed at a succession
of reaches, the friends of State Printer ,
Johnston adv. .cat th â  policy of giv
ing all the money that he figured as
necessary in one big chunk.
The caucus wrestled awhile with the
patronage question. The list was too
big for one night's work, so after nam
ing Howard E. Wright for Speaker
and Alden Anderson of Solano â¢ for j
Speaker pro tern, a committee of five j
was elected to recommend a proper dis- '
tribution of the remaining loaves and j
, fishes. Everybody, of course, wanted
to serve on this committee, and at least
fifteen members were voted for. .The
five candidates receiving the highest
number of votes were Howard Wright
of Alameda. M. K. Arrenoh, Santa
Ciara; A. S. Crowder, San Diego; W. H.

The resolution directs that any two

Forty-five Assemblymen attended the i
caucus to-night. The man at the door j
counted less than this number, but a
tally of the vote on the flection of a
patronage committee recorded the pres
ence of : forty-five. There might have ;
been some repeat Ars. but if so they were
not discovered. The sense of the caucus

ment upon the question of patronage until i

generated earlier In the evening between
the San Francisco delegation and the
. â¢country members developed later Into a.
row of ample proportions. m
. It all hinged on the election of Major
Kyle as Chief Clerk of the Assembly..
Kyle has been all the time the only, can
didate in the field .for, the position." His
election whs considered certain until last
evening when his. name came up on cau
cus. He had plenty of votes and to spare,
but no one was willing to stand the ex
pense of his appointment/
The San Francisco delegation was al
: ready charged with etf -Senator Bank's
lob as sergeant at arms and did not want
Kyle's place charged to its patronage
account. â¢, It proposed on the contrary
that it be divided -pro* rata ' among the
country members.
'jine out-6f-town votes refused to con
sider any such proposition for a minute
â  and the Ran Franciscans were held to ac
count. They as quickly declined to stand
for the position and for an hour or so
Kyle was without sponsors in either fac
tion and the place he is after was open
to any one.

the problem for the better part of. Its

session the matter was settled by As
semblyman Cobb, who, on behalf of the
San Francisco delegation, finaJly agreed
that Kyle should be charged against its
account.
The distribution of patronage was
settled on a basis of $4 per day to each
member and it is expected that this plan
will be ratified to-morrow when the cau
cus is continued. It was decided by the
committee that Major C. \V. Kyle "shall

SENATORS WILL CAUCUS TO-DAY
Will Discuss a Plan to Distribute
Patronage.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. I.â The Republican Sena
tors will hold a caucus at 9:30 o'clock to
morrow morning in the Supreme Court
rooms. The object of the conference is
' to decide upon some system for the dis
| tribution of the patronage and outline a
j plan whereby the State Printing Office
i can be opened. Under the Belshaw law
i the Senators have fifty statutory places
j to distribute and it is expected that thero
will bo quite a wrangle over them. In
the event they are not all selected at the
first session of the caucus an adjournment
will be taken and the officers elected at
| the initiatory session will be sworn. To
â  this extent an organization will be per
| fected to-morrow, but no business will be
. transacted by the Senate until all the
j statutory officers are chosen.
SENATORIAL ORGANIZATION
MAY BE DELAYED
Members of the Upper Branch of the
Legislature Think They Need
More Time.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. I.â As to whether or not
the Senate will perfect Its organization
to-morrow there seems to be some consid
erable difference of opinion. Senator Bulla
would like to see the organization com
pleted and the upper branch of the Legis
lature down to business, but he hardly
thinks that it can be done unless an even
ing session is held. Senator Morehouse
thinks that it can and will be done. Sen
ator Smith thinks that it is Impossible.
He says that there are fifty statutory
offices to be filled and that it will take
the Senate caucus longer than three hours
to dispose of this patronage. Senator
Luchsingcr thinks organization to-morrow
is assured and states that he has inter
viewed a number of his Senatorial col
leagues, who are of the same opinion.
"My idea is that we will have to move â 
pretty fast in order to complete the or
ganization to-morrow," said Senator
Bulla in discussing the proposition. "We
are compelled to fill all of the statutory
offices, and these propositions involving
patronage have always proved very vex
atious. I think that if It is possible for
us to complete the organization to-mor
row by holding a night session we should
do so."
"Why, I see no reason why we should
not complete the organization of the
Senate to-morrow," said Senator More
house. "The Assembly caucus finished
its business in three hours and we ought
to be able to do likewise. There is no
reason for any delay, and why we should
consume more time than the Assembly
has Is something I cannot understand."
GOVERNOR-ELECT GAGE
IN THE SENATORIAL FIGHT
Using Patronage as a Club to Help Friend
Burns Get the Place,
The Threat of Political Ostracism Held Over the
Heads of Those Who. Are Against the
Man From Mexico.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 1. â Governor-elect Henry
T. Gage has arrayed himself on the
the side of those who are supporting:
the Senatorial candidacy of Colonel
Dan Burns. If the power that is his
because of the fact that he will, in a
few days, be the Governor of the State
can bring about Burns' election, then
Burns will be the next United States
Senator.
It has all along been contended that
Gage would keep his hands off the Sen
atorial contest and leave the field open
for all contestants. This belief was
borne out by the fact that Gage him
self has declared that he would in no
way attempt to interfere with the
chances of any candidate for the place.
To do so would be violating a trust im
posed in him by the epople who elected
him, it being presumed that he would
not and could not, in honor, make use
of the patronage at his disposal to in
fluence the votes of legislators in the
interest of one particular candidate.
Now that Gasre has joined hands with
Burnt., the Southern Pacific Company's
candidate for Senator, there is good
reason for belief that the patronage
under control of the Chief Executive
will be used to force reluctant legisla
tors into line for Burns. The threat
of political ostracism, so far as the ,
matter of distribution of patronage
goes, is now being held over the heads
of every member of the Republican ma
jority who have expressed a preference
for any man except Burns. Those who
have expressed no preference one way
or the other are being beaten with the
same club.
Yesterday Gage left Sacramentto, It
being announced that he was going to
Los Angeles to spend New Year's day
with his family and that he would re
turn here to-morrow. Instead of go
ing to Los Angeles Mr. Gage went di
rect to San Francisco for the purpose
of holding a conference with Burns.
The conference was held at the Palace
Hotel Saturday afternoon.
Gage's political attitude has caused
much indignation among Republicans
who are asembled here, particularly
those who have been threatened with a
loss of patronage unless they used their
votes and their influence to secure'
Burns' election. Colonel Burns did not
arrive in Sacramento until this after
noon, but his lieutenants have been
busy all day button-holing legislators
and handing out the threat that "all
the fellows that expect to get a political
job for themselves or their friends had
better fall in behind the' band wagon,
or thpy will get nipped by the frost."
In the absence of Burns this talk had
no effect except to cause some show of
uneasiness on the part of the more
timid of the new members who are
more or less new at the political game.
Now that Burns is on the ground him
self, it remains to be seen how far he
will decide to use the power he has as
sumed, but which he does not possess
in spite of assurances that have been
given him by Governor-elect Gage.
Promises of patronage are easily
made and as easily broken, and Mr.
Gage will no doubt find it impracticable
to ignore the claims of men who have
worked for the interest of the party
and who made it possible for Gage to
be elected. To judge from the talk that
is being heard on every side to-day it
is more than probable that the new
Governor will be made to suffer before
the end of the session unless he sees
fit to take a more moderate view of his
own worth and give some consideration
to the claims of other members of his
party.
It is announced to-night by Gage's
friends that if the Senatorial situation
reaches a stage where It will be a Ques
tion of either Burns or Grant, then
Gage will come out openly for Burns,
the railroad's candidate.
A SHOCK IN STORE
FOR BURNS BOOMERS
Nothing lake a Walk-Over for the
Man From Mexico, and Indications
of a Prolonged Contest.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. I.â When the show down
of positive strength comes the Burns
boosters and boomers may receive a
shock of disappointment. General
talks with members of the Legislature
produce the impression that Colonel
Burns cannot come anyway near the
work of rounding up a sufficient num
ber of legislators to capture the Sena
torial prize.
The surprise of the situation is the
calm and confident assurance of the
PEICE FIVE CENTS.
Grant men. They make claims of
strength and mention, with or without
authority, the names of Senators and
Assemblymen, who are listed as sup
porters of San Diego's favorite son.
They assert that Senator Maggard of
Tehama sympathizes with the aspira
tions of Grant, and inquiry discloses the
fact that Dr. Maggard does entertain
a high regard for the young aspirant.
The sympathy is said to extend to the
Santa Cruz delegation, and even to the
Senator from Siskiyou.
The Burns adherents content them
selves with maintaining an air of pro
found mystery. Delegations are not
openly claimed and names are not
given. It strikes the touts as a good
idea to convey to the unsophisticated
"Jays" the notion that the â¢â¢Colonel's"
consent to become an out and out can
didate is all that is nerressary to dis
solve sympathy for other aspirants and
send the Republicans In a body to
Dan's camp.
Stalwart Republicans like Senator
Rowell, Luchsinger, Smith and Simp
son do not fancy that any candidate Is
going to run away with the Senator
ship on the first bound. Owen Wade
of Napa, a veteran of one war and
several Legislatures, is inclined to the
opinion that there will be a strusrsrle.
He is not sure that the Republican
members care to go into caucus on the
Senatorship.
There was some talk to-day of an im
mediate joint caucus of the Senate and
Assembly Republicans, but after re
flection it was decided toy the promot
ers of the wish that it would be folly
to call a joint caucus l*Â»fore either
house was organised. The fourteen
Democratic Senators may cut a more
important figure in the contest than
the candidates expect. For example.
Senator Larue of Napa is not at all
sure that he will go into caucus and
.bind himself with pledges to support a
candidate .of his own political faith. He
may exercise the privilege of casting a
vote for Senator on higher grounds
than* party policy. Democratic Assem
blymen are just as independent as the
Senators of that party. There is no one
here to wield the party lash and no
one is expected, hence the Democrats
will follow the dictates of conscience.

MAKING OF A SENATOR
A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
Politicians of AH Grades and Conditions
Are Hard at Work for Their
Friends.
The Lobby of the Golden Eagle a Field for the
Study of Human Nature as Repre
sented by Our Law-
Makers.
BY HENRY JAMES.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. I.â Doubtless I
the making of a Senator is a very ;
serious affair. At least it is of sufficient ;
import to i-~'<e some people forget that !
to-day is Sunday, the first of 1899, and j
to ignore the pleasing fact that the rain !
iÂ« falling steadily.
: To-night the lobby of the Golden ;
? Eagle Hotel is full. If some of the po- ;
litical aggregation there is also full,
'â ibis is a delicate matter, and one not i
t<. be discussed here. Of course the
principal interest hinges on the Sena
torial light. There are several, aspi
rants here and each has a following.
While they all profess confidence, it is
noticeable that each is anxious to ' -â¢ \v
what the others are doing. Grant is on
the ground, having teen preceded by
the ever-faithful Milton Green, who
proclaims that the man from the south
cannot lose. Nevertheless, there can be
noticed in his demeanor an air that is
not free from anxiety. He professes an
abiding faith', but the faith refuses to
abide.
When General Barnes arrived he had
hard work to handshake his way
through the crowd. Nobody was slight
ed. He had a glad flipper for every
body. Even 'Long John," the colored
gentleman known about the racetracks
of San Francisco, was on the list. In
fact the general shook hands with
everybody. Those he knew he greeted
by name. Those, he did not know he
smiled at, looking wise, as though to
*ay, "My dear fellow, we are such old
acquaintances that there is no use of
going into details."
There are partisans of Burns here,
and partisans of everybody else w : ho
has been mentioned to succeed Senator
. White, but they are all in the dark
and groping for information. They
eagerly watch the tide of public opin
ion and catch at the straws afloat on
the surface. It is an assured fact that
Burns is not to have the walkover UDon
, which he has calculated. The oppo
sition may be scattered, but it is op
position Just the same.
To gather a definite idea from con
versation with the crowd is a useless
effort. On minor matters there, is no
disagreement. There has' been no dif
â¢ ficulty in selecting the officials of the
â  two houses, but as to the great ques
!. tion the Senatorship there are as
; "many opinions as there are vests being
polished against the Golden Eagle bar.
;Â°' Sig Bettman is here outspoken .for
Burns. So is Leon Dennery. but the
trouble with Dennery is that the other
'. fellow got elected and he must depend
on a majority to overturn the will of
'the people. There may be no good rea
â  eon why Ashe should have been elected
except that he ran against Dennery,
â  who is a Burns creature, and possibly
the simple fact that Ashe was elected
will not be permitted to stand in the
way of Dennery's taking a seat: Hap
pily he cannot get there in time to
vote for his master, in which circum
stance there is a grain of comfort.
. Dennery is circulating this evening,
asserting freely that he is to be Sena
tor from the Twenty-fourth District.
Ashe is also circulating, and while he
does not talk so much nor so loudly. j
exhibits a decent faith that the fact of I
his having received more votes than |
the Burns valet will be recognized. Of j
course, a decision in the matter is a
question for the future.
"To the unbiased observer the crowd J
now on hand is a puzzle. Of course
there are Senators and represetatives
from all quarters, but they do not seem
to know where they stand. They are
"looking for light. Perhaps they are :
finding it. There are politicians who
think light is of the best quality if it is
yellow in â  color nnd bears the image of
the American eagle. A scrutiny of the
mob discovers that there are some poli
ticians of this variety here. All this
jÂ«in }obj .>qj turn uonoauuoD on smj
General Barnes has entered seriously
into the arena. He has opened head
quarters anil announces that he Is in
the fight to stay, whereat the Burns
men and the Grant men and the Bulla
men do not seem happy. Yet, as they
profess to believe that Barnes has not
. .i , ghost of a show their discomfiture
seems hard to explain. For the nonce
readers have the privilege of euPÃsip**.
" The revelations of the near future will
! 'determine the issue. Some there are
I .who believe that a man as yet scarcely
. mentioned will bo the choice. Be this
as it 'may, the coming of Burns did not
create a furore. If he has things all his
'- own ' way ; there was. nothing In the
"^character of- Mis reception to proclaim
it' Even -Grant, , who does not â¢ win
â  friends readily, found more ' ready to
greet him than awaited the colonel
, from San Francisco with all the glory
of having escaped three jails tolerably
fresh upon him.
GOSSIP OF LOBBIES
AND THE MEMBERS
Country Members Find Pleasure Dis
cussing Bain and Crops, While
Others Talk Politics.
feALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. I.â The hotel offices, lob-
Mff and bars have proven the most invit
ing places in town to-day to the Senators,
Assemblymen, place-hunters and mem
bers of the third house. The lower floors
of the big hotels have been congested all
day, but little if anything has been ac
complished In the way of formulating leg
islation or straightening out the chaotic
condition of the Senatorial contest.
In fart, the San Francisco contingent
appeared to be about the only ones who
s.-omed to derive any real pleasure in dis
cussing the political situation. The coun
try members, whether from the moun
tain? or valleys, were much more deeply
engrossed in the rain, which has fallen
with scarcely a minute's Intermission all
day. They seemed almost to strive to
count th<- drops. Anxious inquiries went
up all day as to whether the downpour
extended to all parts of the State. Mines,
wheat lÂ»clds, orchards and vineyards were
vastly more interesting topics of con
versation than the prospects of this or
that candidate for Senator or the passage
f.f some measure. Miners talked Jubi
lantly of full ditches, speedy resumption
of v.-ork in the mines and heavy snowfalls
in the mountains insuring plenty of water
for late summer operations. Residents of
tliÂ£ lowlands discoursed on reviving crops
and trees, heavy yields and the prospects
of fair prices for their products when
they reached the markets.
One of the most active politicians
around the Golden Eagle was Rev.
Charles F. Oehler, who vu chaplain of
the last Assembly, and is anxious to draw
down the accompanying $5 per diem
again for offering up prayers for the spir
itual guidance of that body.

SENATOR BULLA'S HEADQUARTERS
âº CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. Lâ At the Bulla headquarters during the day the Senator himself j
Â» was present almost all the time. Assemblymen L. H. Valentine and N. P. Conrey of Los Angeles assisted in receiving X â 
p callers, and they were decidedly numerous. . T
Senator Bulla is not at all discouraged over the trend Senatorial matters are taking, although he very frankly ad- â¦ I
+ mlts that on the first ballot, in his judgment, he will not have as many votes as either Mr. Grant or Dan Burns. â¦
<$ The Bulla leaders still Insist that they have twenty-two votes, but now say that this maximum strength will come f
â¦ to them on the second ballot. On the first ballot they count on thirteen votes and assert that they will obtain them
from the following sources:
Assemblymen MelUck, Huber, Miller, Valentine, Conrey, Belshaw, McDonald of Alameda Knight Dunlap Sen- %
+ ators Smith, Currier and Simpson. ' +
Assemblyman Valentine of Los Ange'es County, who is leading the Bulla contest, in an interview this after- $
Â£ noon reviews the situation as follows: -f
-4 "We certainly consider that Senator Bulla has a bright prospect of winning this contest and we never intend to %
,s> give up. We will continue to carry on the battle, to the end of the struggle. Our judgment tells us that Bulla is the X
â¦ coming man, and the only thing that will convince us to the contrary is the election of some other man "When that T"
â¦ takes place then Bulla will be out of the fight." " f
â¦ There is a very friendly feeling existing between the Grant and the Bulla men from Southern California and no 7
T bitterness is yet apparent among any of them. One thing Is certain and that is that when the Los Angeles members do X
leave Bulla the greater portion of the vote will go to Grant, unless something arises to materially change the situation <Â£>
+ There is some doubt ms to what Senator Currier and Assemblyman Valentine will do and they refuse to give any In- +
â¦ formation at tins juncture that will tend to forecast their action. But as to the other Los Angeles members they virtu- t
â¦ ally admit a most friendly feeling for Grant in the event of their inability to make Bulla winner. $

GEN. BARNES ACTIVELY
IN THE SENATORIAL FIELD

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 2, 1899.
MEMO, Jan. I.â General'" W. H. L. Barnes
came up on to-night's train and went di
rect to his headquarters, parlors 3 and 4,
Golden Eagle Hotel, where he held an in
formal reception until a late hour. Men
who are avowed adherents of other candi
dates for the Senatorship attested to the
general's popularity by crowding into his |
rooms, anxious to extend to him the com
pliments of the season, at least. But there
were those who unhesitatingly pledged j
their support to General Barnes, promis- j
ing to stand by him to tfie last. General j
Barnes had a pleasant word and a cordial ;
handshake for everybody, and apparently !
was the least interested In the big fight
of any man present.
"I am in this little affair to the last," !
the general said to The Call. "Nailed, you j
might say, but whether to a cross remains |
to be seen. My name was first mentioned j
In connection with the Senatorship in a
peculiar manner, and l.paid no atten
tion to it until I began to receive letters
from friends throughout the State con- :
gratulating me on my candidacy and ex- j
pressing their heartiest -wishes for my j
success. I never before sought an office, ,
although I have devoted the best years
Of my life and spent thousands of dollars
to promote the welfare of the Republican
party.
"Now that I am in the fight I intend to
remain in it just as long as I have any :
show. 1 will not tire my friends out, but
as long as there is an honest fightin?
chance for me I shall remain right here
on the field. When I am convinced that I !
am not In it, I will return home.
"And I want to say right here that I do j
not believe any man has this fight won
yet. I consider the field is still open to i
all. In any event I hope the matter will
be decided soon, for I feel that a long
drawn-out contest would be detrimental i
to the party. Whoever is elected it is my
fervent wish that with his election all ;
strife shall end and perfect harmony be j
restored in the party.
"I look for Mr. Burns, who came up on \
the train with me to-night, to definitely
announce his candidacy to-morrow and i
begin an open fight for the honor, but as '
I said before, I believe the fight is still !
an open one. As to where I look for \
support, or how strong my support is. I i
cannot say. It is only natural that the;
south should have her own candidates,
but if either of them or any others should
drop out, I think I would receive some
of their support,, at least. I have not
figured up the situation as carefully, I
suppose, as some of the other candidates
have done, for strange as it may seem, I
am only a novice at campaigning. By ,
this I jnean for myself and it is vastly
different from handling a fight for some- '
body else.
"In conclusion I can only say that if I
should be elected I would go to Washing- J
ton entirely untrammeled and prepared to ;
devote every energy to advancing the ;
welfare of the State, for I owe no alle- j
| glance to any corporation or individual. ;
I There is one thing I would do were I i

SOUTHERNERS LOOKING
FOR PATRONAGE
Men From the Lower Part of the
State Get Together to Divide
the Spoils.
CALLi HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. I.â The Southern Caliiornia
members to the number of nine held an
informal caucus yesterday afternoon in
tho 'State Printer's office. There should
have been fourteen Assemblymen present
in order to have a full attendance, but
there were five absentees. Assemhiyman
Valentine of i.os Angeles acted as chair
man and Assemblyman Crowder of San
Diego as secretary. The session was thor
â¢j oughly in touch ylth the weather, as it
was decidedly stormy. The main sub
ject debated was that of patronage. There
are sixty-seven places at the disposal of
the Assembly under the Belshaw law, and
there are fifty-nine Republican Assembly
men to claim them.
Southern California members are not at
all slow about claiming everything they
can get, and the object of the caucus this
afternoon was to form a Southern Cali
fornia combination by mutual agreement
to get all possible representation on the
i patronage rolls for that section of the
j State. But the Southern Californlans had
! a hard time agreeing among themselves.
Finally, though, after considerable bick
ering and debating It was decided that
each Republican member from the south
should have one appointment. Then the
caucus adjourned, to meet subject to call.
For the eight places over and above the
fifty-nine needed to go around once there
is going to be a grand scramble, and these
eight places were the bone of contention
in the caucus.
GRANT MEN ARE
VERY SANGUINE
The San Diego Man Thinks the Out

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 4. â The Grant head
quarters at the Golden Eagle were
the busiest of any rooms at
the hotel to-day. Charles Hardy. Grant's
Saft Diego manager, arrived during the
day, bringing 1 with him pome of the con
tingent from the city of Bay'n'climate.
who came to shout for the San Diego
man. Milton Green and Mr. Hardy were
in frequent consultation during the day
and it is safe to say that Mr. Grant shook
hands with more people on the first day
of January, 1599. than in any previous one
day of his existence. He was more cor
dial in his demeanor and appeared to be
quite well pleased at the number of peo
ple who called upon him and at the greet
ings they brought. Late this evening he
consented to talk to a representative of
The Call, when he said:
"The outlook is most gratfying to my
friends and to me. We have received as
surances of support from quarters we
least expected it. Of course, I fully ap
preciate the fact that the contest is go
ing to be a very warm one, but of the out
come I feel confident."
"A great deal has been said, Mr. Grant,
about your residence in California.
Briefly, what are the facts? "
"I have been visiting California each
year ever since 1876 and have resided here
constantly since IS9O. I have had prop
erty investments here for something like
twelve or fifteen years. Now, if these
facts convey any information, you are at
liberty to use them."
The Grant people count on thirtyâ five
votes on the first ballot. They expect to
have every vote from Southern California,
save the eight votes Bulla will have from
Los Angeles County, and these they
claim will come to them after Bulla is
out.
The Grant people are claiming these
Los Angeles votes on the strength of the

HAVANA, Jan. I.â The sovereignty
of Cuba pas?, i from Spain to the
United States at noon to-day.
The form of the transfer was simple.
consisting of only an exchange of
â¢ hes in the saloon of the palace, the
ng down of the Spanish flag and
;hr- raising in its stead of the flag: of
United States on the flagstaff on
palace roof. Salutes were fired
tho heavy guns of the forts and
the warships before and after the
:' Hags. The raising of the
Stars and stripes was greeted with
re by the people, who covered the
of tho buildings around the pal-
I laza.
No i rovÂ»-d was permitted to gather in
the streets in the vicinity of the palace
bs the epoch-making function.

"a hd formed around the square. Captain '
I "astellanos watched them with |
luten sr from the balcony of his apart- ;
ts as they entered the sauare and
stationed at all the streets ap
the plaza. No one was al
; to enter without a pass, and all
the doors of the palace facing 1 the!
re were ordered to be closed. Only 1
I hose who could get on the roofs and;
mica of houses in the neighbor- j
hood saw what was going on before the i
palace.
With the guard was the band of the ;
â rid Illinois Regiment, which had j
selected for the occasion as the
band in the Seventh Army Corps.
the band were the buglers of the
Eighth and Tenth Infantry.
The weather was warm, the sun !
bursting at intervals through the light
clouds and the soldiers in blue who
were forced to stand in the sun found !
the heat oppressive. The troops were |
formed in extended order around the ;
square, three paces apart, and the band i
was massed in front of the nalace en
trance across the street, at the edge
of the park.
Brigadier General Clous, the master
of ceremonies of the day. at 10:30
o'clock issued instructions to the offi
cers who were to take charge of the
various departments of the Govern
ment at 12 o'clock. Colonel Dudley was

Captain Frank B. Hanna. assistant j
adjutant general, to the Department of

ty-one at oon, you are to go to the j
place assigne-d you and demand pos
lon of office in the name of the
I'nited States."
These orders were given under the
arcade of the palace. Each officer had

The latter then crossed the street to
the palace, General Lee on one side of
him and General Chaffee on the other,
followed by the other American gener
als and the Cuban officers. The Cubans
wore dark blue uniforms, brown felt
hats and gray gloves, and they carried,
machetes.
A flourish of trumpets greeted the
procession, and the Spanish troops pre
sented arms as the Americans entered
the palace. The Cubans remained out
side until escorted in by members of '
General Brooke's staff, the Spanish sol- i
diery remaining ail the while at "pre
sent arms." As soon as all were with
in the Spanish troops formed in column ;
of fours and marched around the right j
side of the plaza to the docks, while ;
the band of the Second Illinois Volun- [
teers played the Spanish royal march, j
On entering the palace the American |
generals went to the saloon facing the ,
plaza, which is on the second floor. It
is a lofty chamber, decorated with mir

sons of the Captain General.
Captain General Castellanos was at
this time in a private room off the
throne room. He had given a farewell
breakfast at 10 o'clock to the members ;
of his staff, and had spent the rest of ;
the morning virtually alone, looking at j
the Americans from the balcony. The !
Americans now grouped themselves !
near a large mirror between the two i
central windows, the Spanish staff be- !
ing on the right, while on the left were j
the American staffs, the Cuban gen
erals and the correspondents.
Suddenly Captain General Castella

MILLER MAY HAVE
TO BOMBARD ILOILO
Insurgents Oppose tr;e Landing of
flroerican Forces and th;e Situa
tion Is Most Serious.
MANILA, Jan. I.â The following dig
patch, dated Frldy afternoon Decem
ber 30, at Iloilo, Island of Panay, has
just been received here by boat, tele
graphic communication with Iloilo not
having been resumed:
The situation at Iloilo is grave. Fif
teen hundred natives, fully armed, are
at Melo, a surburb of Iloilo. Seventeen
thousand more, it is reported, are
awaiting orders to embark at several
points on the island of Negros, fifteen
hours' sail from Iloilo.
All the women have withdrawn and
many families have taken refuge with
the Americans. The rebels, after a con
sultation, insisted upon inaction until
General Aguinaldo had been heard
from. General Miller, when this de
mand was first made, declined to concede
j them time and insisted upon an answer
| being given him by noon to-day. At the
I same time he gave assurances that
| lives and property would be protected.
The foreign residents then petitioned
, General Miller to grant the extension
I destred by the rebels, as a fight would
| cause inevitable loss. This also Gen
i eral Miller refused.
At the designated time a native com-
I mission again boarded the United
| States transport Newport and asked
| for delay, saying that they were unable
I to control the army, which commanded
; the city and surrounding country. Gen
' eral Miller refused and prepared to land
! forces, sending an emissary back to
Manila for instructions. It is said that
General Miller informed the envoys
that the city must be turned over to
! him, but he promised he would give the j
I insurgents twenty-four hours' notice if
he >ater decided to bombard the place.
The insurgent newspaper in Iloilo
stated on Friday that the rebels were
I fully determined to resist the Arner
| loans. It was very evident the people
I in the city expected bombardment.
The British second class cruiser Bon
; aventura and the German cruiser Irene
I were the only foreign warships at loilo.
The rebels are strengthening their po
sition and are preparing to resist. The
streets of Iloilo are full of armed sol
diers who are constantly entering in
every direction. There is great excite
ment, which is increased by the appear
ance of the gunboat El Cano, flying the
Spanish flag. The public buildings,
churches and boats along the river are
filled with rebels.
The Newport's boats, as the dispatch
boat which carried this message is i
about leaving, are being lowered with :
four machine guns mounted in their |
bows. The lighters are alongside thÂ©
United States transport Arizona. Th* i
United States transport Pennsylvania 'â 
lies three miles to the south, with steam \
up.
Colonel Potter will leave Manila to
morrow with instructions to General
Miller from Genera! Otis.

Washington correspondent sends the
following. Following the receipt of
grave advices from Major General Otis
a Cabinet meeting was held at the
White House to-day which resulted in
the framing and dispatch of important
instructions to the American command
er at Manila. Advices received early
this morning related to the situation in
and about Manila, and this evening an
eral Brooke and others. After shaking
hands, General Brooke sat upon a sofa,
while General Castellanos moved to
ward the group of Cuban generals.
British Vice Consul Jerome introduced
him to General Mayia Rodriguez. Shak
ing be.-th the hands of the Cuban of
ficer, in the usual Spanish fashion, Gen
eral Castellanos said: "We have been
enemies, but I respect you for your
correct attitudes and opinions. I have
pleasure in shaking your hand."
General Rodriguez replied: "I thank
you, general. I feel sorry for the Span
ish army, which has defended the ban
ner it was sworn to defend. I also have
pleasure in shaking your hand."
Captain General Castellanos took his
position near Major General Brooke.
The buzz of conversation on the Ameri
can side of the chamber contrasted
with the silence on the Spanish side.
There was a marked difference between
the Americans and Spaniards, the for
mer tall, heavy and wearing much
Sold cord; the latter small and slight,
in blue striped cambric uniforms. The
Spaniards w ere depressed, the Ameri
cans were correspondingly buoyant.
At the last stroke of 12 the boom of
a gun brought all eyes to the point in
the room where stood the Captain Gen
eral, who was talking with an Ameri
can oflicer. Immediately all was si
lence. The Captain General stepped to
the left, taking his position directly in
front of his staff. On his right stood
Captain J. S. Hart, interpreter to the
! United States Military Commission.
i Next to Captain Hart, in the order
named, Generals Chaffee, Brooke, Lud
low, Lee, Wade, Butler and Clous. Im
! mediately behind General Chaffee was
I Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia.
At this moment the band of the piaza
was playing the Spanish anthem. As
the guns. at Cabanas fortress ceased
firing there was a breathless pause in
the saloon. Everybody knew that the
American flag was being raised on the
palace by Major Butler, son of General
Butler, and that the stars and stripes
were going up on all the official staffs
in Havana. After this second of si
lence the band on the plaza played
"The Star Spangled .Banner," while the
guns of the fleet and fortresses began
to roar out the national salute of twen
ty-one guns.
Immediately Captain General Castel- i
lanos handed the manuscript of his
speech to Captain Hart, and began to
speak. Amid the strain of the band
and the noise of the guns it was im
possible to hear him.
"Close the windows," said some one,
and the casements were closed, but the
sound of the cheering still visibly dis
turbed the Captain General.
Addressing himself to Major General
Wade, president of the United States
Military Commission, though he
seemed to look at the floor, General
Castellanos said:
"Gentlemen: In compliance with the
treaty of Paris, the agreement of the
Military Commissioners of the island
and orders of my King at this moment,
of noon, January 1, 1899, there ceases in
Cuba Spanish sovereignty and begins
that of the United States. In conse
quence, I declare you in command of
the island, with the object that you
may exercise it, declaring to you that I
will be first in respecting it. Peace hav
ing been established between our re
GENERAL MARCUS P. MILLER, Commanding the Expedition t Iloilo.
other dispatch was received describing
the situation at Iloilo. There is no
disguising the fact the situation in the
archipelago is extremely serious. On
the Island of Luzon the insurgents are
threatening. There are dissensions
among them and General Otis is hav
ing a difficult time in steering a mid
dle course.
What makes the situation particular
ly puzzling is the mysterious disap
pearance of Aguinaldo. Just where he
has gone and what the object of hi.Â« fib
sence is the authorities do not know,
nor has General Otis any inkling so far
as he has advised the department. But
in some quarters the apprehension is
felt that he is making preparations to
resist the Americans.
Respecting Iloilo General Otis an
nounced he had received advices from
General Miller showing American
troops had landed at Iloilo, and that
he was in communication with the in
surgents respecting the occupation of
the city. Cable advices did not show
that an alarming situation existed, but
it is admitted they indicated that the
condition was critical.
It developed during the discussion
that the President and Cabinet are in
accord in their determination to deal
spective governments, I promise you to
give all clue respect to the United
States Government, and hope that the
good relations already existing between
our countries will continue until the
termination of the evacuation of those
under my orders in this territory."
After Captain Hart had translated
the address, General Wade said to Gen
eral Brooke: "1 transfer this command
to you."
Major General Brooke said: "I ac
cept this great trust in behalf of the
Government and President of the
United States, and (addressing Captain
General Castellanos) 1 wish you and
the gallant gentlemen with you a pleas
ant return to your native land. May
prosperity attend you and all who are
with you."
Generals-Brooke and Castellanos then
shook hands, after which General Cas
tellanos and staff retired from the
throne room,' shaking hands with Mr.
Jerome, who stood near the door of
exit. As they retired there was a
movement toward General Brooke,
Brigadier General Clems shaking him
by the hand and saying, "Success to
you."
Generals Brooke and Chaffee, with
others, then stepped upon the balcony
and looked down upon the plaza. A big
American flag Hying over the arsenal
was in full view, and farther away the
stars and stripes could be seen over
Cabanas fortress. Meanwhile, the of
ficials o-f Spain were saying farewell to
their nation's seat of power in the new
world.
Turning to his officers. General Cas
tellanos said, with tears in his eyes:
"Gentlemen, I have been in more bat
tles than I have hairs on my head, and
my self-possession has never failed me
until to-day. Adieu, gentlemen, adieu."
Then, with arms upraised, he moved
swiftly toward the stairway, escorted
by General Chaffee and followed by his
staff. As he crossed the plaza the
American ladies who were standing in
the balcony of the barracks waved
their handkerchiefs, and General Cas
tellanos responded by bowing and kiss
ing his hand toward them. At the cor
ner of the plaza, with tears in his
eyes, he turned to take a final look at
the palace. He co-uld see the American
generals on the balcony.
Without a word he turned sharply in
the direction of the wharf. History had
reversed "The Last Sigh of the Moor."
At the dock Generals Clous and Chaffee
bade him farewell and the retiring
Captain General put off for the Spanish
transport Rabat, on which he will pro
ceed to Mastanzas. He will be accom
panied by a battalion of the Thirtieth
Infantry.
Major General Brooke held a recep
tion in the palace salon, the various
officials paying their respects and
promising allegiance to the United
Slates. First came the doctors of the
University of Havana, at their head
President Barriel. All wore black silk
and velvet gowns and small, black silk
caps, with yellow tassels. All bared I
their heads and bowed low. Next came i
the municipal authorities, headed by !
the Mayor, and after them the Econom
ical Society, formerly an advisory
board to the Captain General, with
Senor Alfredo Zayas, its president,
leading them. Then came the firemen.
Numerous speeches were made, to all]
firmly with the situation. It is desired
to maintain peaceful relations with the
insurgents, if it is possible to do so, but
it was appreciated the condition of af
fairs now existing cannot be much
longer tolerated.
Instructions which were sent by Sec
retary Alger this evening approved
General Miller's determination to oc
cupy the city. General Otis was ml
l structed, however, to frequently com
i municate with the insurgents at Iloilo
through Miller, and the island of Luzon
and impress them with the purpose of
the United States to give them a bene
ficent government. It is expected by
the authorities that General Otis will
issue this week the proclamation to the
Filipinos which was cabled him eight
days ago. General Otis has explained
to Secretary Alger that delay in pub
lishing the proclamation hart been due
to the necessity of translating the in
strument into Spanish. Just as soon
as the translation is completed and
copies of the proclamation printed it
will be wildly distributed throughout
the islands in order that the natives
may, by this means, become informed
of the attitude which this Government
has adopted toward them and the pol
icy it intends to-oursue.
of which General Brooke replied briefly.
At the close of the reception the Cu
ban generals were introduced. Gen
eral Brooke said:
"I shall look to you to assist us in
carrying out the purpose that brought
us to this shore. It is a great trust.
and I shall expect most extraordinary
assistance from you."
General Lacret, who acted as spokes
man for the Cuban officers, assured
the United States Military Governor
that everything in the power of the
Cuban military officials would be done
to help the Americans restore Cuba to
a condition of peace and prosperity.
The speech was translated by Captain
lage of Virginia.
It was scarely 12:30 o'clock when
General Brooke and his staff left the
palace for the Hotel Ingleterra. Com
modore Cromwell and Captains Sigsbee.
Berry, and Foss of the United
States squadron, arrived a few minutes
later, too late to pay their respects. The
only lady who witnessed the scene in
the salon was Mrs. John Adams Fair
of Boston, who was ushered into the
palace by mistake. When she was
about to retire, Colonel Gelol. the Cap
tain General's chief of staff, begged her
to remain. All the other ladies were
assigned places in the balcony of the
barracks overlooking the plaza.
SENTIMENT OF CUBANS
DURING THE PARADE
HAVANA, Jan. I.â The parade of the
United States troops showed the feel
ing of the Cuban element of the popu
lation. The march was from El Vl
dado, along- the Archi del Norte. the
Prado and Central Park to Cerro and
Quemados. About every fourth house
displayed some decoration, a palm
branch, a bit of red, white and blue
bunting, or a flag. Not a dozen flags
were to be seen in the stately Prado.
In the Archi del Norte the troops
passed under the skeletons of trium
phal arches, left unfinished when it was
decided to postpone the demonstration, j
The roofs, the streets, the parks and
the waysides in the suburban districts
were crowded with curious, but for the
most part, silent spectators. Now and
again there was a cry of "Vive los
Americanos," followed by a burst of
cheering, but there was no general ex- |
pression of public rejoicing, though j
Major General Lee, who rode at the j
head of the column on a gray charger,
received a personal ovation alone near
ly the entire route. Major General
Brooke, Major General Ludlow and the
generals reviewed the corps, standing
on a bench in front of the Hotel Injjle
terra and surrounded by their staffs.
As the column swung into Central
Park, past the lonely statue of the
Queen Regent, it made an impressive
appearance. General Lee left the oro
cesslon and joined the reviewing gen
erals. At this point there was more
cheering than elsewhere for. the Ameri
cans, the crowd being immense and
densely congested.
The order of the parade was as fol
lows:

REDDING, Jan. I.â The snow which
commenced falling at 7 o'clock last
night continued until 2 this afternoon,
and at 4 o'clock indications are that
there will be more. Measurements of
the fall in Redding and for eight or
ten miles in either direction give from
twenty-two to thirty inches. This is
the heaviest snowfall ever known at
this particular point, and is of the
"dry" variety, which packs and remains
longer than the ordinary. Telephone
communication to both western and
eastern points is completely stopped;
consequently there are no advices from
points where the storm is usually se
vere. The north-bound Oregon evpress
arrived on time at 7 this morning, hut
j could get no further until about 3 this
afternoon, when two engines with a
small push snowplow arrived from
Dunsmuir and after some delay maii
j aged to get the train started north. The
! local electric light plant is disabled and
I will not supply service to-night. The
; stages all started on time to -day. but
i it is not thought they got very far on
j any of the roads. Several wearc roofs
j on shanties gave way, and all day men
i have been busy keeping roofs free. It
is generally conceded the snow will
prove greatly beneficial to the mining
; interests.
STOCKTON, Jan. I.â Farmers of San
Joaquin County had a welcome New
Year's greeting to-day, as a light rain
| began falling when flaylight came.
| Shifting winds made the fall vary from
I a brisk shower, to a fine mist up to i
| o'clock, when the wind reached the
â  right point and ceased blowing. The
downfall then became steady and by o
o'clock the drops were heavy and con
tinuous. An hour later the leaden sky
was giving a fall which, if it ke^ps ujÂ»
during the night,- will insure for the
twenty-four hours fully one and a half
inches. There is every indication rf a
splendid night's rain, as the wind has
all but ceased. The temperature is at.
the right point and the sky heavy.
Back in the mountains there has ai
rc-udy fallen more snow than came all
labt winter. The snowfall in those nat
ural reservoirs means as muca as rain
in the valley, as it is from this- point
much of the moisture is drawn during
the heated terms. This ana the lata
rams have had a revivifying influence
en the business and farming commun
ity, and the channels of trade already
have experienced unmistakable signs of
returning confidence. The New Year
could not have come in a more accept
able manner for the people in this part
of the San Joaquin Valley.
SAN: JOSE, Jan. I.â Santa Clara Val
ley was to-day treated to the greatest
shower of the season. It began raining
at 9:30 o'clock and continued uninter
ruptedly all day, with indication.? Â»hat
the storm will last all night. Neaily
an inch of rain fell. Never before wan
it so welcome, and it is impossible to
estimate the amount of good dem-Â»<i.
It means several million of dollars to

the orchardists and farmers in the val
ley, besides brightening the trHde of
merchants. Thousands of acres havo
been plowed and sown to grain and to
day's rain was badly needed to start it
growing. Some farmers have not
plowed for fear of drought, and these
will now rush their work. Orchards
have suffered from the dry spoil, but
this will give them a good start at a
time when it is needed. Besides bene
fiting orchards, the rain has bten a
boon to nurserymen, who, up to ihia
time, have been unable to dispose of
their stock. Now tre<? planting will sro
ahead. Hay lands will be materially
affected. Very heavy rains are reported
in the foothills, especially at Los Gatos,
where it is said an inch had fallen up to
5 o'clock. The rainfall here was heavy
and steady and soaked into th? ground.
The record up to to-day shows 3.55
inches for the season, against 6.65
inches last year.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. I.â The new year
certainly has been ushered in under fa
vorable circumstances, so faras Sonoma
County is concerned. A splendid rain
began here shortly after the church
bells had announced the birth of an
other year, and it has continued al
most without interruption ever since.
The precipitation so far has amounted
to almost three-quarters of an inch,
and as there are no indications yet
shown of its ceasing, there is no ques
tion that the ground will be given a
thorough soaking. For several weeks
rain has been needed badly in this
county. While most of the plowing has
been done, feed was getting very short,
and new grain was making very slow
growth on account of the cold weather.
Considerable sickness has been noted
hereabouts, caused without doubt by
the long-continued dry spell. This
morning's rain was accompanied by a
heavy thunder storm, which cleared the
atmosphere thoroughly and cold weath
er has been succeeded by a much milder
temperature, which will start things
growing in splendid shape.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. I.â There was a
steady fall of rain in this vicinity all
day, accompanied by an extremely
fierce and cc-ld wind, driving the rain
into the earth and making travel on
the streets uncomfortable. It was
really the first hard rainstorm expe
rienced this season, and was exactly
the kind the farmers in this locality
had been praying far. To-night the
rain is coming down at a lively rate,
and it is estimated that an inch afis
fallen within the past twenty-four
hours. There is every sign of a con
tinuance of the storm through the
night. Reports received at railroad
headquarters this evening state that a
hurricane is blowing at Red Blnff and
snow is falling there. At Dunsmuir
thirty inches of snow had fallen, and at
Redding twenty-three inches, while
heavy rains are reported from all val
ley points as far south as Oakland. This
includes the farming and grazing lands,
where* rain has been so badly needed,
and the beneficial effects of the storm
will be widespread.

FRESNO. Jan. I.â The new year
could not have opened brighter for the
farmers of Fresno County and this por
tion of the San Joaquin Valley. It be
gan raining at 9 o'clock this evening
and at midnight continues, with good
prospects for an extended downpour.
The rain has come just in time to save
, a large amount of sown grain. Owing
to the continued drought some of it,
perhaps, will have to be resown be
cause of the seed rotting In the ground.
The early sown grain, or summer fal
low, while suffering for lack of mois
ture, is not beyond redemption and If
this storm continues long enough to
give the ground a thorough soaking
will yield a large crop. While the sea-
BOli so far has been a dry one, the farm
ers have not despaired and a large ma
jority of them have "dry plowed" in
anticipation of a wet period. Conse
quently with good spring rains Fresno
will yield one of the largest grain crops
in the history of the county. Stock
has not as yet suffered for want of
feed, although pasturage has been very i
short. The total rainfall for the season
is 1.94.
AUBURN, Jan. The new year
started off with a terrific wind storm.
Telephone wires are down and many
large trees have been cut to the

miners. A good deal of water has al
ready fallen.
MODESTO, Jan. I.â Rain fell In

â¢ short a space of time. The rain con
tinues with no sign of abatement. The
surf about Point Pinos and other more
.exposed portions of this coast is ex
. tremely heavy, because of the high
wind. At Carmel, the principal fruit dis
trict of this section, 0.85 of an Inch of
rain had fallen between 9:30 a. m. and
4 p. m. to-day. Advices from points as
far south as Bur district report a gen
eral rain with more or less wind.

HEAVY DOWNPOUR
IN SAN FRANCISCO
Indications Are That the Precipita
tion Will Continue To-
Day.
[ The New Year's gift to California was
i a bounteous rain storm that came down
| from the clouds just in time, like an
j answer to prayer. Nor was there only
; the liberal shower alone for a blustering
I wind was prevalent. It whirled itself
[ around corners coming from other cor
ners, and flew down the street between
the high houses, setting everything mov
able wildly aswing; reversing umbrellas
and driving the rain into their owners
faces; hurfing hats aloft among the
meshes of overhead wire or under the
cable cars to be ground to fragments;
catching the belated or be-earlied tlsh
horn musician yet in the throes of his
new year salutation and wetting him
down handsomely. It was the literal ap
pearance of the proberbial "Lion of
March" rampant, just two months out of
its place on the calendar.
The going of IS9S in starlight and the
coming of 1899 in rainstorm, causing the
opening day of the year to be a period of
climatic disturbance, might be attributed
to the descent of Professor Hammon, the |
weather sharp, from his eyrie on the
crest of Tamalpals. The absence of ,the
| forecaster from his post might have given
I the weather an opportunity to get up a
little festive new year "blow out" on its
own account. However, that Is a metero
logical secret. But as if in answer to
prayer, the storm came most opportunely. 1
The long continued dryness and slight
; showers that have alternated over the
State through November and December
have brought visions of farm failure in
the country and commercial depression in
the town. The fields were growing dryer
and business was growing duller when
January opened with its rain. Tho
weather reports up to late last night show
that the storm Is general In the upper
and middle portions of the State and is
moving southward and eastward in strong
showers. Sacramento has received in this
storm three-quarters of an inch; Santa
Rosa has been blessed with a copious
downpour, and at Red Bluff the fall has.
been over two Inches for the last twenty
four hours.
In this city yesterday sixty-hundredths
of an inch was recorded. Late last night
the barometer was falling "everywhere,"
In the words of the forecaster, indicating
a continuance of the storm.
The following is the forecast last night:
The storm is Etlll central off the coast of
Washington. The pressure has fallen rapidly
over the entire Pacific Slope during the lust
twenty-four hours, the lowest reading being
2y.2S inches, at Astoria.
R*n has fallen in the western portions of
Oregon and Washington and the northern por
tion of California. Snow is now falling In the
"astern portions of Washington and Oregon and
In Nevada.
The rain will extend Into Southern California
Monday.
The rainfall at Red Bluff during the past
:.iur hours amounts to 2 Inches.
Coadltiotu are favorable for continued rain
In California, though there may be a tem
jjoniry clearing during Monday.
Forecast made at Han Francisco for thirty
hours, ending midnight. January 2; 1599:
Northern California â Rain Monday; brisk to
high southerly wind.
Southern Californiaâ Cloudy, with rain, Mon
day; fresh southerly wind.
Nevadaâ Snow Monday.
Utahâ Snow Monday.
Arizonaâ Cloudy, with snow In the mountains
Monday.
San Francisco and vlctn'tTâ Rain Monday;
fresh to brisk southerly wind.
G. H. WILLSON,
Local Forecast Official.
The heaviest shower of the season in
San Francisco fell for about twenty min
utes yesterday afternoon. The rain began
with a strong wind blowing about forty
mlk-s per hour. The gale drove fiercely
through the streets, bending the towering
sign fences and the Baldwin ruined walls
backward and forward in an apparent en
deavor to scatter the picturesque struct
ures over the sidewalks. But the wind
was soon beaten down by the shower and
the rain had it all its own way. The
gutters were quickly afloat, and of course
the man-holes were sealed up with street
trash and the flood spread over the pave
ment. At the corner of Eddy and Market
streets the car track was deeply sub
merged and each car was delayed, while
the conductor and gripman fished In the
muddy water with iron pokers for thÂ«
hidden switch*.
At a number of crossings south of Mar
ket street pedestrians were obliged to go
around the block 'on acount of the deep
water. The gates of Central Park were
closed on account of the rain and the
baseball game at Recreation grounds was
adjourned. The proposed Havana evacu
ation celebration at Union Square did not
take place. When 9 o'clockâ the hour cor
responding with noon in Cubaâ arrived the
rain was piling down on the speakers'
stiind and the grounds were without a
visitor, consequently no outdoor meeting
could be held and the hour passed by
without the observance and celebration.

I ing the Second Division.
Every man in the last company of
the One Hundred and Sixty-first In
diana Infantry as he entered Central
Park drew from under his uniform a
small Cuban flag and waved it before
the assemblage. The Cubans went
nearly wild with cheers and excitement,
and General Lee immediately sent the
inspector general, Lieutenant Colonel
Curtis Guiltier., to order the Indianans
to put away the flags, which they did. j
It is reported that the entire company
is under arrest.
General' Lee turned in after the 'col
umn passed, the crowd pressing close
around his horse, shaking his hand and
making other- demonstrations of affec
tionate interest. His orderly was heav
ily burdened with flowers for the gen
eral.
The corps was up at daylight at
Camp Quemados, took coffee, then
marched leisurely to El Vedado; a dis
tance of five miles, arriving there and
had breakfast, after massing haver
sacks, reaching the foot of the Prado at
noon and getting back to camp after j

Havana harbor presented a sulking
appearance this morning. The stars
and stripes were conspicuous en the
American men-of-war and merchant
men across the bay, while launches
were constantly plying between the
shore and the ships. The docks were
crowded with " sight-seers, many of
j whom wished to enter Morro Castle
! and Cabanas fortress, but they were re- j
fused admission. â¢-â¢-;-; \
When Lieutenant Lee, son of General j
Lee, with Lieutenant Jones and Lieu- j
I tenant Colonel Livermore of the army, i
Ensign Webster, Boatswain Hall and
Gunner Applegate of the cruiser !
Brooklyn, representing the navy, en
i tered Cabanas, they found; no Spanish !
j flag flying from the staff and the hal- j
yards were tangled. Two sailors of the
Brooklyn rove off new halyards, and
Lieutenant Lee requested the Spanish
officer in charge, Lieutenant Cache, to
hoist the Spanish flag, that the Ameri- I
cans might salute it. Lieutenant Cache j
was about to do this, when Lieutenant i
â¢Colonel Cavetstany, Governor of the
fortress, said it would be unnecessary.
I Then on the signal from the Brooklyn |
â  the sailors under Gunner Applegate
i fired twenty-one guns at Cabanas, after
which Lieutenant Lee, who was in full ;
dress, hoisted the stars and stripes, the j
Spaniards firing twenty-one guns in sa- j
lute and Lieutenant Colonel Cavestany â¢
handing the keys of the fortress and an \
j inventory of its contents to the Ameri
can officer. â¢
At Morro Castle Lieutenant Wade, i
I son of General Wade, raised the Stars ;
I and Stripes and Quartermaster Ser- i
' geant Morsoig hauled down the Spanish
flag amid cheers. Lieutenant Colonel
i Birnie of the ordnance department, who ;
i has a receipt under the evacuation j
' agreement for the contents of the forts
to Lieutenant Sancho, the Spanish Gov
ernor, then turned over the fortifica
tions to Major Russell Harrison of Gen
! eral Lee's staff, who in turn made a
formal delivery to Lieutenant Patter
son, First North Carolina Infantry, who
has a garrison force of ten men. â¢
Then the Spaniards were escorted out j
of the castle by American troops under
Major Harrison and given a cordial
farewell on leaving for the transport.
Lieutenant Wade was refused pos
session of the Spanish flag, the Spanish :
officers saying they must take it with ,
them. About noon a Cuban produced i
a spectacular effect by letting loose a
big Cuban flag from a kite string high |
over Morro Castle, where it Hew all the
afternoon. ipWfH?
The United States military commis
sioners -wired President McKinley at
12:30 that the Governor General of Cuba
had formally surrendered to the com
mission the government of Cuba and
that the American flag had been hoist
! cd. In reply General Wade received
, the following:
. "I congratulate the commission upon
! the successful termination of its mis
sion and the peaceful occupation of
Cuba by the United States.
"WILLIAM McKINLEY."
General Brooke also received the '
President's congratulations. As Cap- ;
tain General Castellanos was escorted ;
to the wharf by Generals Clous and i
Chnffee the band played the Spanish
royal march. General Castellanos
thanked General Clous, and as he i
stepped Into his launch wept. Crowd?* |
of Spaniards, men and women all \
dressed in black, gathered upon the I
seawall and silently watched the fleet \
pass out. There was not a shout, not
a handkerchief waved. Men and women
wept together. The Spanish squadron,
which sailed to a rendezvous at Mar
tinique, consisted of the Rapldo, with
Admiral Manterola on board: Gallcia,
Marquis de Mollnas, Vicente Yanez, .
Pinzo, Marauis de Ensenada, Vasco j
Nunez and Patrlota, the last towing the
transport Filipinos.
CUBAN INSURGENTS
ARE TO BE MOLLIFIED
HAVANA, Jan. I.â The American
military officials in Havana have had
word from Washington to treat the
Cuban insurgents with more considera
tion, and in consequence thereof there
has been remarked a change of de
meanor toward the Cubans to-night. It
is reported that General Menocal is to
be assistant civil governor of Havana.
It is impossible to verify this rumor,
but it is given weight by the fact that
the American officials who should know
refuse to give it denial. The Cubans
are considerably mortified, and If this
rumor proves true the bad effects of
earlier mistakes will be overcome.
HOW BUSINESS IS BOOMING.
Great Showing Made by the New j
York Life Insurance Company.
NEW YORK, Jan. I.â The year closed j
with business booming. The Bureau
I of Statistics at Washington figures the
I country's excess of exports over im
" ports for 1898 at $617,000,000, and these
figures tell the whole story. Everybody
i believes a still further enlargement of
; foreign and domestic trade is in store
j for 1899.
This morning the New York Life In
! surance Company reported its year's
work, and of all the companies is the
first to publish Its statement. The re
j suit surprises the oldest insurance men
: and furnishes fresh proof of the busi
. ness revival of 1898.
President John A. McCall of the New
! York Life states that his company in
! 1898 has "been paid for more than $152,
--! 000,000 in new insurance, an increase of
j more than $15,000,000 over 1897, and has
i now a total of policies in force exceed
] ing $945y000.000, being a gain during the
j year of $67,000,000. The average mind
jean scarcely grasp, the significance of
theso figures, which denote a larger
gain in this one company alone than
was shown In the previous year by all
I the other regular life insurance com
panies of this State combined, and is
an unparalleled record.
While this record is strikinp-Tv excep
tional gnins in somewhat the same pro
portion have been made by the banks
and the large commercial houses. It
is interesting to note from President
McCall's report that California has been
one of the leaders in this tremendous
increase in the company's business.
Fire in a Bank Building.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 1. âFire early this
morning did about $3000 worth of damage
to the fixtures in the Los Angeles Na
tional Bank in this city. The fire origi
nated in a barber shop in the basement of
the bank building on the corner of Spring
and First streets. The costly woodwork
and ceiling decorations were Injured and
some papers destroyed.
PENNSYLVANIA'S
ASSEMBLY LINES
UP FOR BATTLE
Senatorial Struggle
Begins.
THE OPPOSITION TO QUAY
IT IS BEING DIRECTED BY THE
BUSINESS MEN'S LEAGUE.
Congressman Dalzell of Pittsburg
and Charles C. Tubbs of Tioga
Axe Also Aspirants for
the Toga.
HARRISBURG, Pa., Dec Lâ The
General Assembly will open its bien
nial session at 12 o'clock Tuesday in the
new Capitol building. After the Sen
ate and House have organized. Gover
nor Hastings will send in his biennial
message. Lists of standing commit
tees will hardly be ready to announce
before the inauguration of Governor
elect Stone, on January 17, so that the
Legislature will not get down to work
in earnest before February. There Is
a strong sentiment amons 1 the legis
lators in favor of a short session. Both
Democrats and Republicans will cau
cus to-morro^' evening for the organi
zation of the houses. The Republicans
have a majority of 74 on joint ballot,
and naturally expect to control both
houses. There are 37 Republicans and
13 Democrats in the Senate and 127
Republicans and 11 Democrats and 6
fusioriists in the House.
Senator Quay's friends have fixed
Tuesday evening for the Senatorial
caucus, and the only question now Is
whether 128 Republicans will ro Into
the meeting. If they do, everybody ad
mits that Quay will control a majority
and that he will be nominated. His
opponents are making an effort to keep
enough members out of the conference
to prevent a nomination, and if they
can do this they expect to prevent the
Senator's re-election. Congressman
Dalzell of Pittsburg and Charles C.
Tubbs of Tioga are the other avowed
aspirants for the Senatorial nomina
tion.
The fight against Quay is being di
rected by E. A. Van Valkenburg. the
leading spirit of the Business Men's
League. Republican workers are belne:
brought here from all over the State
to take a hand in the fight for United
States Senator.
The hotels are crowded to-nlsht and
by to-morrow will be filled to overflow
ing. The Quay managers are on the
airirressive, and are leaving nothing un
done to make votes for their leader.
The anti-Quayites are Just as active,
but there are not near so many of
them and their policy will be fully out
lined before to-morrow.
The new capitol, although unfinished,
presents a very creditable appearance
Inside.
CONTESTS IN NEBRASKA
AND TENNESSEE
LINCOLN, Jan.* I.â With but few ex
ceptions, members-elect of the Ne
braska legislative session, which begins
on Tuesday, are in the city. The Sena
torial contest, which since the election
has secured most of the attention, has,
with the arrival of so many members,
for the time being given place to the
Speakership canvass. The Republicans
control both branches of the Legisla
ture, but in the lower house by a bare
majority of four, and with four active
Republican aspirants for the Speaker
ship and some bitterness awakened,
there Is a bare possibility that the fu
eionists may secure the presiding of
ficer. This is made possible by the re
fusal of a few Republicans to go Into
caucus and abide by the results. All
kinds of pressure was brought to bear
on these members, but up to midnight
without success. The Senatorship, It
is generally understood, is behind the
contest for Speaker.
NASHVILLE, Term., Jan. I.â Nearly
all of the members of the Legislature,
which meets at noon to-morrow, are in
the city. The body Is overwhelmingly
Democratic In both branches. Monday
the Democratic caucus will be held.
While it Is not certain that the selection
for United States Senator will be made
at Monday's caucus, it Is possible, as
there is no opposition to the re-election
of Senator W. B. Bate, and there will
be no opposition.
The State's finances will occupy
much of the time of the session, as the
floating debt amounts to $850,000, and
there is a growing demand for its
speedy retirement.

They admit that there was an instruction
to vote for a Southern California man
after Bulla was out, but they deny, that
it was intended that the vote should go to
Grant, under any circumstances.
The Grant men have sent south for a

have them here as soon as it is possible

LANGFORD FOB. PHELAN.
The Nestor of the Upper House De
clares Himself.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. I.â Hon. B. F. Langford,
State Senator from San Joaquin, arrived
here to-day and to-morrow will begin his
twenty-fourth year of service in the Sen
ate of the California Legislature. He
never served in the Assembly, but since
his first election, twenty-three years ago,
he has served consecutively in the Senate.
He is a widely known Democrat of the
old echool, and to use his own expression,
Is a reformer from first to last He has
not yet made up his mind to go Into cau
cus of his party on the Senatorshlp. Ha
had a choice for Senator, however, and
speaking to-night of his preference said:
"I shai- cast my vote for Mayor Phelan
for United States Senator. I do not know
him, but from what I hear, I believe he Is
the right kind of a man.
The Senator Is always for reform and
most of the time for economy, but old
timers, almost as old as the Senator, ob
serve that his zeal gains new luster and
brilliancy after the State Institution in
San Joaquln County has been provided
with money for its support.
FEW LEGISLATORS IN TOWN.
The Departure of Statesmen for Sac
ramento Continues.
Last night's overland train carried an
other batch of legislators to Sacramento,
and the few remaining In this city will
probably leave for the capital some time
to-day. Those to go yesterday were
mostly statesmen from the interior of the
State, who came to San Francisco for the
purpose of comparing notes and finding
out how the land lay before the opening
of the Legislature, and remained over af
ter attending Saturday's caucus, visiting.
There are probably not more than half a
dozen remaining in the city, aside from
the San Francisco delegation.
The effort of the Burns men to create
the Impression that the candidacy of Bulla
for the United States Senate is merely a
blind, and that the Los Angeles man will
throw his strength to the Mexican
mine-owner when the proper time arrives, i
Is bitterly resented by the members of the
Los Angeles contingent who were still in
town yesterday. They said Burns is pim
ply trying to hoodwink unsophisti
cated legislators whose votes have not
been pledged to any candidate in order to
induce them to fall In line for him on the
supposition that he Is -the only candidate
witn any following. They declared that
Bulla is in the fight to stay, and that his
strength is growing dally. There is no
doubt that Bulla will secure many votes
of members, who, while they have no can
didate of their own, are unalterably op
posed to Burns' candidacy. Many who re
fuse to say how they will votÂ« are
only waiting for developments before an
nouncing their choice, but the majority
of those in this category do not hesitate
to say that they are not and will not be
for Burns under any circumstances.
PUBLIC FUNERAL OF
EMBASSADOR ROMERO
President McXinley Among Those
Who Honor the Memory of
the Mexican.
WASHINGTON, Jan. I.â Public funeral
services over the remains of the late
Don Matiaa Romero, the Embassador
from Mexico to the United States, who
died on Friday morning, were held at St.
Matthew's Church to-day. Distinguished
honor to the memory of the deceased was
manifested In the presence at the cere
monies of President McKinley, tive Pres
ident Hobart, nearly all the members of
the Cabinet, representatives of the entire
diplomatic corps, officers of the army and
navy and private citizens. At the con
clusion of the service the body was taken
to Mount Olivet Cemetery and placed
temporarily in a vault pending Its re
moval to Mexico.
Before the body was taken to the
church there were brief services at the
house,- attended mainly by the official
staff of the legation and the relatives and
immediate friends of the family. At the
church the casket, preceded by the Presi
dent and Cabinet, the honorary pall
bearers and other distinguished persons,
was borne to the body of the church in
front of the altar rail and placed on a
catafalque. The President was met at
the door by Senor Don Jose Godoy, the
first Secretary of the Mexican Embassy,
and escorted to a seat reserved for him.
Representatives from the State Depart
ment, the army and navy and from the
diplomatic corps acted as ushers. The
services at the church were very brief,
consisting of a low mass, followed by ab
solution services. Father Charles M.
Bart, assistant pastor of St. Matthew's
was the celebrant.
At the conclusion of the ceremonies the
casket was placed In a hearse and accom
panied by relatives and friends was taken
to the cemetery and placed In a vault.

FINAL REPORT ON
NICARAGUA CANAL
It Will Submit Estimates on Four
or Five of tf)e Proposed
Routes.
& NEW YORK, Jan. I.â A Washington special to the Herald says: &
Â£ Every effort is being made by. the Nicaragua Canal Commission to "8
5 hasten the completion of its final report on the practicability of an 8
# isthmian waterway. This report will submit estimates' .on four and 8
8 probably five routes, but from present indications the commission will &
6 not change its recommendation in favor, of the Lull route. In mak- 8
8 ing its estimates of $123,000,000 on the Lull route and $124,000,000 on 8
Â£ the Maritime route, the commission figured on a .canal which will 8
8 have an average width of 150 feet and constant depth of thirty feet. All 8
& locks, of course, will not be so wide, eighty feet having been selected 8
8 as the width. Â»
Â£ It is explained to me by a member of the commission that the char- O
8 acter of the soil would have a great deal to do with the width, but its : 8
# examination convinced the commission that 150 feet is the mean &jt-' v
# width to be adopted. In its estimates on other routes the commission . 8
8 is figuring on the same dimensions. Civil Engineer M. L. Endicott. $
6 chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, who was a naval member &
8 of the Ludlow Commission, pointed out to me to-day that the conclu- 8
Â£â¢ sions of the Walker Commission were much the same as those of the &
Â« fomer. / Â»
0. "Our estimate as to the cost of the canal was something like $133,- &
8 000,000," Endicott said. "ThÂ» estimates of Rear Admiral Walker and 8
8 Civil Engineer Haupt are $10,000,000 lower, but the estimates of Col- 8
8 onel Haines ad, j2O per cent to their estimate, so that the mean is &
8 about what the Ludlow board fixed as the cost of the proposed 8
& canals. ' The Ludlow board called particular attention in Its port 33
6 to the Lull route as being worthy of close investigation. I think &
5 the Lull route practicable, but I would not say It is the best until I 8
8 had examined the records' and reasons of the Walker Commission. &
Â£â¢ To make the Ochoa dam lower lessens the difficulty of the problem, 8
8 and I think consideration of this point probably makes strong reason 8
& for Rear Admiral Walker and his colleagues in urging the low level 8
Â» route." ' , &

BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Dec. 24 (by steam
er Al-Ki to Seattle Jan. 1).â Old winter
himself has no terror the gold hunter
will not dare. A party which has just
returned from Porcupine Creek, up the
Chilkat trail, faced howling storms and
four feet of snow in order to reach and
stake some small creeks which Jiead up
from Porcupine. These ' creeks had
been prospected a little at their mouths
and were known to contain fine gold on
the surface. It was a race and a fight
against the elements, for the way was
hard and provisions for a quick trip
necessarily short. The party chartered
a small steamer. Among them were:
Edward Fenley, who, with S. W. Mix,
is the discoverer of Porcupine Creek,
and is a California miner hailing from
Los Angeles and Randsburg; O. M.
Dutton of Dawson, Andrew Scheff of
Gunnison, Colo.; Jack Bigelow of Daw
son, McKenzie of Juneau and Sam Lu
cas of Norwalk, Cal. Fenley was in
duced to become the leader of the Dar
ty, being familiar with the country and
having reliable knowledge possessed
by no one else.
The following new creeks were named
and stakedâ that is, what is believed
to be the best ground was staked: Clear
Creek, Summit, Little Salmon, Glacier,
Marble, Bear and Deer. Twenty loca
tions were made on Clear and Summit
creeks and fifteen on Little Salmon.
The return of this party has increased
the confidence of the people here in the
Porcupine Creek district. The gold is
clear and clean, being of finer quality
than any that has come out of Dawson
that I have seen. Fenley said this aft
ernoon:
"I think there will be a better camp at
Porcupine than at Atlin. though as yet
it has not been possible to learn just
how good the ground is nor hÂ«Jw wide
spread the placer deposits may be. The
discovery was made too late in the
fall to go to bedrock on more than a
few claims. I weighed my dust the
other day that I took out of Discovery
on Porcupine and found nuggets
amounting to three ounces and a half.
Pete Nation and a man named Scott
are wintering in there, but about every
body else has come out. There is Fix
f ee t <->f snow on the ground, the rivers

and that is another reason why it ou^ht

Clear, Summit and Little Salmon
creeks are in what- has been namei'the
Salmon River district. A miners' meet

that not more than one Ideation could
be made by one man; thnt claims
shquld be of not more than 1000 feet in
stead of 1500. so ns to eive mor* men a
chance to strike something, ami that all
claims takon before August 15 next
must have $100 worth of work done on
them before the January following. S.
W. Mix of Shasta. Cal.. wa.= made Re

claims were staked in the snow. Over
100 claims in all have been staked in the
Porcupine Creek -district.
LEAVING DAWSON BY
THE RIVER TRAIL
JUNEAU, Alaska, Die. 28 (by steam
er Al-Ki to Seattle, J;i*i. I>.â The Al-kl
put In here for two h-mrs and hastened
southward with H^out . thirty men
aboard who had corie over the ice and
snow up the river fx>m Dawson. Klon
dikers are cominp up the river now
every few days. Jome say the trail la
hard and others nff It is easy, the opin
ion depending of the experience and
hardihood of th* man. The condition
in Dawson is wlAt might be called nor
mal â plenty of food, plenty of whisky,
plenty of sport eto., for those who ha,ve
the means and desire to enjoy them
selves. There is no danger of a short
age of food. Men in the mines get $1
an hour for eight hours' work a dajr,
as a rule, though a few companies are
paying only $5 a day.
J. M. Ryan of Port Townsend. Wash.,
says there is work in Dawson for all
who want to look for it. Work at the
mines is going right along, and the
dumps of gravel containing gold are in
creasing rapidly. The Canadian police
posts and road houses along the river
make traveling a "picnic," as compared
with the rough experience of last wln-Â«
ter.
About Deoember Ist there was a
stampede to a new creek named Car
lisle, about thirty miles from Thistle
Creek, near the mouth of Stewart
River. Gold was reported there in
plenty. It is a small creek. People, aa
usual, left Dawson unprepared in the
effort to get there first, and must un
dergo hardships and danger before they
can get back.
Among the best known Klondikers
aboard the Al-Ki are Major Strickland
of the mounted police, and wife, who
are going to Ottawa, Ont., lor the win
ter, and Captain Pingree, a brother of
Governor Pingree of Michigan, who is
interested In a Dawson commercial
company.

THEY WANT TO TELL
These Grateful Women Who Have
Been Helped by Mrs. Pinkham. :j
- ( :
Women who have suffered severely
and been relieved of their ills by Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and medicine are
constantly urging publication of their
statements for the benefit of other wo-
men. Here are two such letters:
Mrs. Lizzie Bevkelt, 258 Merrimac
St., Lowell Mass., writes:
11 It affords me great pleasure to tell
all suffering women of the benefit I have
received from taking Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound. Icanhard-
ly find words to express my gratitude for
what she has done forme. My trouble
was ulceration of the womb. I was un-
der the doctor's care. Upon examina-
tion he found fifteen very large ulcers,
but he failed to do me good. I took sev-
eral bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, also used the Sanative
Wash, and am cured. Mrs. Pinkham's
medicine saved my life, and I would
recommend it to all suffering women.'*
Mrs. Amos Trombleat, Ellenburgh
Ctr., N. V.. writes:
"I took cold at the time my baby
was born, causing me _to have milk
legs, and was sick in bed for eight
weeks. Doctors did me no good. I
surely thought I would die. I was al-
so troubled with falling of the womb.
I could not eat, had faint spells as
often as ten times a day. One day a
lady came to see me and told me of the
benefit she had derived from taking
Lydia E. Pinkham's medicine, and ad-
vised me to try it. I did so, and had
taken only half a bottle before I was
able to sit in a chair. After taking
three bottles I could do my own work.
lam now in perfect health." '

(\ GREAT YEfJR.
THE commercial returns for the year 1898 are
practically all in and they show the year to have
been the greatest in the business history of the
United States. This news has already been liberally
luntcd, as the trend has been in this direction for
some weeks, but the figures are staggering.
To begin with, the center of financial power has
begun to cross thr ocean, and it may not be long ere
tiie American dollar may supplant the English s,ov
n as the basis of the world's exchange. Even
;mw New York divides with London the first place in
international finance. This country is lending so
many millions to Europe that for the first time, for
eign banks look to New York to dictate the rates of
exchange. This may be temporary now, but it is
like!) to become a permanent condition in the future.
There is nothing visionary in this hypothesis, for the
ter of the commercial and social world is ever
moving westward, and has done so as far back as
history goes. At present this movement is progress
ing with such rapid strides that the attention of the
whole world is arrested.
Trade figures at the close of the year show that
fining i^)S the United States sold two dollars' worth
ods for every dollar"s worth it bought. The ex
ports reached the enormous aggregate of $1,250,000,
--000. which is an excess over imports of $617,000,000.
In 1897 this excess was $357,000,000. As to the influx
<jf gold into this country last year the amount is
amazing, being $140,000,000, while the best previous
record was less than $75,000,000. A good deal o: this
gold lias been loaned back to European banks at
profitable rates of interest, and considerable has been
recoined into American money and gone into national
circulation. The exports of cotton during the year
amounted to 3.936,000.000 pounds, while in no pre
vious year have the exports reached 3.500.000,000
pounds. The exports of breadstuffs reached the total
of 220,000.000 bushels of wheat, including flour, and
201.000.000 bushels of corn.
But it was in industrial progress that the world's
r.ecprd was beaten by the United States in 1808. The
output of pigifon was 11,645,000 ton?, the largest in
the history of the country by 2.000,000 ton*, and larger
than Great Britain ever produced by 2,800.000 tons.
The exports of iron manufactures in ten months were
$87,650,000, while the imports were only $13,500,000.
Xevtile goods, however, did not make such a bril
liant showing as iron and steel goods. Cotton
touched the lowest price in fifty years, with the great
est yield ever known. Cotton goods declined 5 per
( evu tip to the middle of November, but since then
have risen " per cent and do=ed at the highest point
of the year, thus auguring well for 1899. The wool
trade of the country was disappointing, enormous
supplies having congested the markets during the
major part of the year.
Thr. financial statistics also made a good showing.
The failures throughout the United States numbered
]r,6Bj. a decrease of 11. 2 per cent from 1897, while
the liabilities decreased 0.5 per cent. The commercial
dcaÂ«h rate or the proportion of traders failing to those
in business was the smallest since tÃqj. A gratifying
feature of 1808 was that the liveliest and best business
of the country was done outside of Wall street, that is,
by merchants and farmers rather than by stock oper
ators, though there were several lively times in that
famous speculative mart during the year. Taken on
the whole. 1898 was a banner year and for the coun
try at large could not have been better if it had been
made to order. As for the Spanish war, which some
worthy people predicted would plunge the country
intt: r financial panic and visit us with hard times for
years to come, it cut no figure of any consequence,
being merely a sort of extended Fourth of July cele
bration, a momentary ruffling of the eagle's feathers,
nnd by this time has been relegated to the limbo of
history;
The participation of California in the great com
mercial celebration of 1898 was only partial. Dry
weather clipped our wings last year, though we still
had feathers enough left to make a respectable flight
with and keep in sight of the balance of the national
flock. We are not accustomed to the fag end of the
procession, however, and do not like to be there. It
does not seem like home.
It would, indeed, be a serious blow to things in
general if Assemblyman Kennealy were to be de
prived of the privilege of voting for a great and good
citizen for Senator through the simple circumstance
(.1 having killed another citizen who had -not the
honor of being in politics.
A question naturally arises as to what provision of
the statutes Rums can turn to for authorization of
his scheme for being at the same time Governor and
Senator.
Well, there are people who had thought better of
Major McLaughlin.
BETRAYAL OF A TRUST.
TO expose the untrustworthiness of the telephone
Jompany was not a pleasing task, but it became
a duty and was performed. That a co-pporation
whose chief hold upon the public is based upon the
understanding that it will keep faith, to betray the
secret messages of its patrons is a breach of. decency.
It passes beyond a simple breach of trust. It is dis
honorable, diÂ«honest and despicable.
When a message is put on the telephone wires it is
always with the idea that it will go from sender to re
ceiver without being diverted to the listening ear of
a wire-tapper. That a man connected with the Exam
iner should have conceived the plan of breaking into
the confidence of people conversing on matters in
jno way his concern, is not surprising. That he should
have desired to pry into private affairs and use the
stolen information for his own benefit creates no feel
ing akin to amazement.
The startling phase of the situation is that in all
I this skullduggery he seems to have enjoyed the sanc
| tion of the company and the active co-operation of
i employes. To him were revealed the communications
passing between husband and wife, between business
partners, between associates in politics. By the
I scheme of tapping the wires he was able to know
many things he had no right to know, and which a
man of principle would have scorned to have acquired.
But the blame does not rest with the individual
solely. The telephone company must share it. It
has forfeited its claim to public confidence. It has
grossly abused those who have paid it toll. Not only
has the fact become manifest that messages go awry,
but it has been learned that messages are put in writ
ing and placed on file. Why? That the company
has no right, no good purpose in doing this, is clear.
It is at best a piece of impertinence. It is, in the
light of revelations, a grievous and impudent wrong,
placing every subscriber at the mercy of a corpora
tion. When word cannot be sent over the telephone
wire without being sidetracked, switched to the ample
j ear of the meddler, it is time for the wires to be per
mitted to rust and the hello girls to be sent where !
â  they cannot interfere.
Letters and telegrams are safeguarded, hedged
about- with restrictions of honor and polity, but the j
message given to the telephone company is the com
mon property of the company itself and of every
eavesdropper who chooses to buy his way into the
i fellowship of that concern or of any of its numerous
! employes. However, it is fitting that the expose
i should have come through : the partnership of the
Examine* in the iniquity.
â 
Now, a question arises as to what method of pro
tection the public has. To fortify itself against spies
is a difficult operation. At least it must have from
the corporation assurance of reform, or it will be
obliged to withdraw its patronage from an institution
; which demonstrated facts show to be unworthy, which
â  will not shield it against the approach of a sneak, and
which, for a fee to its servants, exposes secrets to the
world. There have seldom been stories more shame
ful than that told in The Call yesterday morning. The
: telephone company is culpable. It has been exposed
j and its disgrace is open. What have its representa
j tives to say?
They will probably say nothing. But the Legisla
ture is about to convene and abuse is one to be
regulated by statutory enactment. The patron of a
: telephone company is entitled to the same protection
j afforded the patron of a telegraph company, or of a
postoffice. Such dereliction as has been laid bare
should be corrected through the enactment of a law
making it a felony.
LOSSES BY FOREST FIRES.
AN article of timely interest and pertinent to the
welfare of California is that on "Forest Fires"
â¢ in the current number of the Forum, by Henry
Gannett, chief geographer of the United States Geo
logical Survey. It is timely because the importance
of providing some means for preventing the destruc
tion of our forests, which is so clear to people dur
ing the months when the fires rage, is generally for
gotten in the winter when the Legislature meets, and
is therefore ignored in the work of the ses-ion. Mr.
Gannett's article comes in time to recall public at
tention to the subject and revive popular desire for
a remedy for the evil.
The first notable point in the article is the state
ment made on the strength of official statistics of the
extent of the damage caused by forest fires. Speak
ing generally Mr. Gannett says: "Every year when
the summer heats have dried the vegetation, forest
fires prevail over the Northwest from the Great Lakes
to Pugct Sound, and over the pineries of the south:
and thousands of square miles of forests go up in
smoke. In addition to millidns of dollars' worth of
timber there are destroyed each year ranches and
e\en towns which stand in the track of the llames,
not to speak of the loss of life." He adds:
"Let us get some measure of the amount of this
destruction. In the year 1880, in connection with
the tenth census of the United States, Professor C. S.
Sargent collected all possible information concerning
the forest fires which occurred during that year. The
results of that investigation, which ,in the nature of
tilings could not be exhaustive, showed that there
were burned at least ten and a quarter million acres
of forest land â an area twice the size of New Jersey,
The value of property thus destroyed was more than
I $25,000,000. This is the tale of one year, and a year
not at all remarkable for its forest fires."
The waste is more destructive on the Pacific than
on the Atlantic coast, as Mr. Gannett points out. be
cause on this coast it seldom rains from May to Octo
ber and by August the forests are as dry as tinder.
On this coast, therefore, the need of laws for forest
preservation is more important than elsewhere, and
yet we are behind the more progressive States of
the East in undertaking the work. Within a genera
tion, says Mr. Gannett, one-fifth of the magnificent
forests of Western Washington have gone up in
smoke. Timber having a stumpagc value of $30,000,
--000 has thus been thrown away in a part of this one
State.
New York led the way in providing laws for the
protection of her forc-ts and as a consequence she
now suffers little from the ravages of fire. New
Hampshire, Maine. Massachusetts. Wisconsin, Min
nesota and Pennsylvania have lately followed her ex

ample, and their experience demonstrates that the
evil can be greatly diminished if not eradicated.
With such illustrations before her of what can be ac
complished by wise laws enforced at a comparatively
small cost, California should not delay in following
the lead of these progressive commonwealths. She
should be the next State to protect her forests, and
the needed legislation should be provided this winter.
NO New Year's day ever brought to California a
more acceptable or more valuable gift than,
that brought yesterday in the showers which
fell in abundance over so large a portion of the State.
It was, indeed, a glad day for all who have been j
watching the long procession of weeks of sunshine,
impatient for the rain.
The records of the State show that not infrequently j
seasons which began as dry as the present one, have |
after New Year and toward spring been profuse of
showers, and in the succeeding season all forms of
crops have been abundant. There is now a fair pros
pect this will be a season of that kind. Gradually the i
drought has been breaking up. There, have ' been â¢â 
more or less clouds for some time past, and at last
there has set in what promises to be a period of good
rains.
â¢It is not in the rural districts only that the benefits
lof the showers will be felt. With the brightening
prospect of a good season there will come a greater
I confidence in all lines of business, and that industrial
and commercial activity which has been so notable in
the East for the past three months will be manifest
here not less energetically than in the most progres
sive States beyond the Rockies.
It seems, therefore, that we are to have a really
glad New Year. The evils caused by the drought
will pass away and once more California will take the
lead of her sister States in the profusion as well as
the variety of her rural products. We shall be in good j
condition to prepare for the development of com
merce with the Orient, for the world's great exposi
tion at Paris and for our own State exposition the j
year after. In fact after the years of struggling with |
the free trade depression, the financial panic and the j
drought. California is about to be herself again. She
needs nothing but rain, and the new year has brought I
that and promises more.
SINCE the publication in The Call of the story
of the Two Republics concerning the seizure
in Mexico of a large quantity of California
wine found to be adulterated with salicylic acid there
has been a renewed activity in the direction of pro
viding a better enforcement of our pure food laws
and of obtaining from the Legislature further
statutes on the subject where such are needed. To
that extent good has resulted from the event, and
the incident cannot be regarded as an unmixed evil.
When the reports get abroad of what is being done
in California to protect the purity of its food products
the effect upon the general public will be highly bene
ficial, and if these efforts result in completely elim
inating frauds from the trade, there will be a sure
market for California goods. in countries where our
products are now regarded with suspicion and dis
trust.
The benefits of the proposed inspection will be
particularly felt in our wine industry. Abundant
reasons exist for believing that the long struggle. for
an entrance to the world's wine market has about
j succeeded, and that California winemakers are to
have better times than has been their lot in the past.
Moreover, the demand for our wine in some parts of
our own country is rapidly increasing. The New
York Sun, in commenting upon the extent to which
the use of wine is supplanting the use of beer in some
parts of the Union, recently stated:
"A New Orleans brewer asserts that in Louisiana,
while the quantity of beer sold during the five months
from July to November, 1597, was 111,675 barrels, it
was, during the corresponding five months of 1898.
only 82,736 barrels. For the same two periods the
sales of California wine in Louisiana increased from
14.118 barrels in 1897 to 48,230 barrels in 1898. It is
sold in pitchers and cans, thus avoiding the bottling
tax, and is retailed at the rate of 5 cents per quart,
with a chunk of ice thrown in."
The Sun adds it lias been noted that the French,
Spanish, Italian and South German peoples in that
city arc consuming less beer than formerly because of
the increasing consumption of California wine. It
seems, therefore, that the industry is on rising ground
at last and has the prospect of an enlarged home
market, the best in the world, before it. Whatever
is done at this time, therefore, to keep the product
pure and wholesome will be highly profitable in the
; long run.
In the meantime it should be remembered that no
matter what may be accomplished in California for
j the enforcement of pure food laws, the subject ca*n
j never be effectually dealt with by any authority less
: comprehensive than that of the United States. As
I long as F.astern adulterators can mark their fraudu
' lent output with California labels, so long will our
j producers be handicapped in the market. The pro
moters of such laws, therefore, should push the fight
at Washington. Every effort should be made to pro
cure the enactment of a statute on the subject, either
at this session or at the next.
It is well to be frank. The retiring Board of Edu
! cation is the rottenest body ever convened, unless one
I of the "kangaroo" courts which convicts form to try
one of their own number. Waller and Ragan would
be stars in such a court. Possibly they are practicing.
The only surprising feature about the official denial
of the authenticity of the Examiner's latest interview
with the Pope is that one should have been considered
necessary. Not only was the fake apparent, but it
had the indorsement of Creelman.
With all respect possible under the circumstances
for the learned counsel of Mrs. Botkin, the public is
not prepared to believe that as to the sort of crime
she committed there cannot be found a competent
jurisdiction and a law to fit.
Judge Sweeney's one day term of office was all too
short. lie had the privilege of turning loose only two
women pickpockets. They boasted of a pull, and ap
parently knew what they were talking about.
Astronomers Barnard and Burnham have received
new honors. These are in addition to the honor of
having been frozen off Mount Hamilton by the justly
I celebrated Professor Holden.
Dewey and Lee might make a strong combination,
j but handicapped by the effusive indorsement of Wat
terson they would have a fight on their hands.
Sir Robert Ball predicts an explosion which will
rend the earth. It is surprising to learn that Sir Rob
ert has been keeping an eye on Sacramento.
Compliments to Professor Hammon, and if he has
I any more rain storms in his repertoire will he kindly
I trot them along?

MR. T. V. CATOR'S
RETROGRESSION
To the Editor of The Call: As one
of T. V. Cator's most faithful suDPort-
I ers, and as his ready defender for seven
years past .'whenever he has been as
; sailed by political opponents, though
j ever openly and- frankly opposing his
I political nipthods whenever occasion
i demanded it, propriety will certainly
permit me to make brief reference to
the letter which appeared over his sig
nature In The Call of last Thursday.
I note first this opening sentence:
"So many * â¢' * have asked me
whether 1 intended to take steps to re
i organize the People's party," etc. His
signature to the letter, with that sen
tence in it, was quite superfluous so far
as the Populists of this State are con
cerned. It may seem ungracious to in
timate that Mr. Cator was not "the
whole thing," and yet it is probable
that the Populists themselves will In
due time "take steps" to advance their
cause, and that, tuo, in spite of Mr.
Cator's able effort to justify his un
qualified repudiation of the principles ;
he formerly held and which they still
cherish as fondly as they did while he
advocated them. Mr. Cator has appar
ently forgotten that he took no steps
to organize the People's party at Los
Angeles in October, 1891, and also that
he took no part in the lirst State con
vention, held in Stockton in June. 1892.
The reform forces will again be or
ganized, I doubt not, and without his
assistance.
With painful surprise many thou
sands will read this unwarrantable
statement made by Mr. Cator: "It is
apparent that the main support of the
People's party came from those who
thought free coinage of silver at the
ratio of sixteen to one a desirable pol
icy." No one knows better than Mr.
Cator that during the time while the
People's party madÂ« its great growth
and commanded the confidence of the
country the subject of free coinage of
silver was never discussed by the
speakers or the press or the party, and
in his own pamphlet on the money is
sue, one of his best efforts, he himself
ignored the sliver question. One of Mr.
Cator's worst political blunders, which
hurt him seriously in his own party,
was in setting aside his prior convic
tions on the money question and taking
up silver in Joint debate with Colonel ;
John P. Irish. I am loth to think of
Mr. Cator as capable of making the
above quoted statement that free silver
was the main support of the People's
party. It is in no sense true. In the
growing days of the People's party,
when men came into it by tens of thou
sands with joy in their hearts, national
ownership of the railroad and telegraph
lines, the abolition of the so-called na
tional banking .system, Government Is
sue of full legal tender paper money (
and the land question constituted the !
State and national platforms, and the !
whole literature of the new party. Sil
ver was ignored, even as Mr. Cator
himself Ignored it.
I will not comment rurther on the
astounding Incongruities â which go to
make up Mr. Cator's attempted justi- ;
fication for making public a total re
versal of all his political views. That
he now Indorses the national banking
system and the gold standard, finds it I
easy to say a good word for the trusts. |
and can amuse himself over his recent i
fad of free silver â that he can say the j
other things In this strange letter to
the publicâ shows a capacity for change
and a lack of devotion to principle j
which I think will not much commend j
him to the confidence of the party to i
which he has now transferred his al
legiance, and may cause him to wait
some time before "they give him any
thing he wants." I think Mr. Cator has
made another political blunder. Policy
has once more got the better of his
judgment. He has deserted the reform
movement when It in such a growing
moral force in our country and
throughout Europe as It never was be
fore in the history of the race.

which he tells at the expense of the â¢

1 gentleman in question was a close com-
I panion of the author of "Trilby" when
j the latter was a student in Paris. Dv
! Maurler had rooms In a house kept by an
j elderly maiden lady, who possessed a jar
of gold fish. These small fish were the
Joy and pride of the old lady's life, and
she was accustomed to place them every
day on a ledge just outside of her win- i
dow. Dv Maurier . occupied the room
directly above that of his landlady. One
pleasant spring day as he sat by his
window he noticed the jar of gold lish.
Now Dv Maurier loved a practical joke
and it suddenly occurred to him that
these same gold fish offered an excellent
chance for him to have ( some fun at the

out that her boarder was the perpetrator
of the joke and her wrath knew no
bounds. The future novelist with all of
his earthly belongings was mercilessly
piled out into iiie street and Dv Mavfrier

A fire at Ferrol (one of the naval arse
nals in Spain) on December 3 destroyed
$800,000 worth of naval stores and fit
tings, among which were those belonging
to the Admiral Cisnero, an armored
crusier of the same class and type as the
Marie Teresa, Oquendo, Viscaya and Cris
tobal Colon, destroyed off Santiago on
July 3 last by the American fleet.
The keel of the battle-ship Venerable
will shortly be laid at the Chatham dock
yard. It will be the first time in the his
tory of that yard that three ships have
been built on the same slip within a pe
riod of eleven months.
The Japanese torpedo-boat destroyer
â¢Murakuma (Darkening Cloud), one of the
six boats built by. Thornycroft, has made
a very successful trial, making 30Vi knots
for three continuous hours, the engines
developing 5900 horsepower on 205 pounds
of steam and "89 revolutions. The Mura
kuma is 210 feet in length, 19 feet 6 Inches
beam, displacing 275 tons when down
to her Foa-goincr draught of 7 feet 6 inches.
Her armament consists of one 12-pounder,
five 6-pounders and two IS-inch torpedo
tubes. There are three Thornycroft boil
ers, having collectively a heating surface
of 15,500 square feet and 200 square feet of
grate. With hatches open the boat is ca
pable of making 22 knots.
The sea fight off Santiago on July 3
last demonstrated the fact that the mili
tary masts are a source of great aanger
to the gun crews, and might even cause
the surrender of the ship in the event of
the masts falling on deck. On one of the
Spanish ships the mast had fallen di
rectly over one of the 6-inch guns, no
doubt disabling the crew. On another ship
the fallen mast lay across the heavy bar
bette guns, thus interfering with If not en
tirely destroying their usefulness. In orert
deck vessels this question is a most seri
ous one and may lead to radical changes.
Fighting tops may be entirely discarded,
and the masts used solely for signaling
purposes, in which event they can be
made much lighter and thereby greatly
improve the general efficiency of the ship,
especially in stress of weather.
The two ships building at Cramns' for
the Russian navy promise to be the most
efficient vessels of their classes on limited
displacements. The cruiser, which is to
be completed first, will be 400 feet in
length, 52 feet beam and about 19 feet 6
inches draught, displacing WOO tons. She
will have two triple-expansion engines
and 30 Nlclause water-tube boilers, devel
oping 20,000 horsepower, and a speed of 2?
knots on a trial of twelve continuous
hours. The armament consists entirely
of rapid-firing guns, and its caliber and
disposition is as follows: Twelve 6-inch
on the main deck, of which four are on
each broadside, two aft on the poop and
two forward on the forecastle. There are
also twelve 3-lnch and six 6-pounders dis
tributed all over the ship, and four tor
pedo tubes, one on each broadside and in
the. bow and stern. The coal capacity is
1400 tons, and the complement 450 officers
and men.
Italian shipbuilder? Nt Leghorn and at
Sestri Ponenti, near Naples, share with
Elswlcks the honor of turning out the
most efficient war vessels. Orlando
Brothers, at Leghorn, have recently com
pleted in the short time of eighteen
months a duplicate of the Cristobal Colon
of 6SS2 tons. .Tho ship was built for the
Argentine Republic and is named General
Belgrano. Seven of these armored cruis
ers have been built in Italy, and the last
differs from- the others only in her bat
tery. She has an all-round nickel-steel
armor belt of six inches maximum thick
ness, and the side armor amidships < x
tehd.9 to the main deck, which, with thf
bulkheads, forms a complete citadel in
which tlio primary battery is carried. Tho
armament consists of two Armstrong
guns mounted in barbette on the main
dock, one at each end of the redoubt; ten
G-inch Armstrong quick-firers in battery
within the redoubt on the main deck; four
similar gunsâ two forward and two aft
on the main deckâ firing on a line of the
keel; two 3-Inch rapid-firers; ten 2 1 4-inch,
eight 1%-lnch Maxims, besides two land
ing mitrailleuses; two Maxim-Nordenfelt
guns and four torpedo tubes on the,
broadsides. The engines develop SGOO
horsepower under natural draught and
13.000 under forced draught, and on her
trial made 15. 09 knots on a displacement
of 200 tons in excess of the normal. T'n
der forced draught the speed is 20 knots.
The bunker capacity is about 1100 tons,
and capstans and ammunition hoists are
worked by electricity.

A Fable Up to Date.
Mr. Popinlawâ Eureka!
Mr. Straightâ What?
Popinlawâ l have found it!
Straightâ Found what?
j Popinlawâ Found the store that un-
dersells Pattosien's Two-Acre Store in
the Mission.
' Straightâ You have! Where is it?
Not on this continent, J am sure.
Popinlawâ l tfell you. The other day
.going up Main street I saw on the oat-
side of' a big furniture store over the
door the picture of a couch marked
$3 50. I am positive that the cheapest
| couch of that character at Pattosien'a
J was not less than $6; there's a saving
| of a half for me in buying that couch.
Straightâ That's a sprat to catch a
! mackerel. A will-o'-the-wisp to lead
j you into a bog. That couch is merely
to lead on to other things.
Popinlawâ Now am 1 not right? Isn't
that a bargain?
Straightâ You are and you are not.
Inlawâ That's a paradox. How can
I I be wrong? Do you not admit that I
would have to pay Pattosien'a 56 for
that couch?
Straightâ So I do, but wait. That
couch is purposely put there to deceive
the unwary.
Popinlawâ l do not understand you.
Straightâ You will understand; just
let me talk. You know when I was in
the furniture business years ago I had
to battle against the same business
methods. This very couch you are
speaking of may be worth $5 wholesale,
if well made; if it is not it might cost
only $o. Did you try to buy the couch?
Popinlaw â Xo. I only priced it.
Straightâ lf it is well made and worth
$5 the store will lose $1 50 on it. The
moment you try to buy it the salesman
will do his best to get you away to an-
other of greater value and if he fails
in that he depends on making up the
$1 50 three times over on the next arti-
cle. Were the other things marked in
plain figures like they are at Patto-
sien's?
Popinlawâ No; they had letters on
the tags instead of figures.
Straightâ l thought as much. The
S-K-I-N-T-H-E-L-A-M-B cipher sys-
tem. One thing marked F-O-X and an-
other W-O-L-F. Honest traders. -such
as Pattosiens don't want to conceal
their prices. They are fair and above
board.
Popinlaw â But don't that couch indi-
j cate low prices?
Straight â Oh, you sweet innocent!
! You dear pigeon, trussed for plucking!
I All goods are high in a sore that will
i do such deceptions.
Popinlaw â But that couch was cheap!
Straight â Oh, you guileless gullible.
I Don't you see that that's a decoy duck!
; A lure! Can't you hear them singing,
j "Walk into my parlor, said the spider
jto the fly." It's a cock's feather to bait
! a salmon hook. Just like the dirty
j signs that you see plastered all over
i the store. Those soiled doves of the
j salaried sign writer are like bandages
,on the legs of crippled horses;
i they show at once the poor
beast that carries them is a bro-
ken-down, spavined cripple, getting
â  ready for the knocker's yard. They are
I danger signals. When you have gazed
j on them pass them by on the other side
f and keep straight on. Board the KAg-
; sion-street car; go right ahead and
i don't stop till you get to Pattosiens, at
Sixteenth street, and there you will
learn the honest price of goods.
Popinlaw â I must say Pattosiens
mark all their goods in plain figures.
Straight â And such figures. You can-
not find at the decoy duck's nest what
! you will at Pattosiens'. Such things
' for instance as elegant Wiltnn carpets
j for $1 a yard, or superb Roxbury make
; for 80 cents. Mind you, sewed and laid.

' The bullet penetrated the left lung near
the heart.
Detectives Dillon and Cody are working
,on the case, but their efforts to get the
â¢details of the crime have so far" been
: thwarted by the evident desire on the
-> part of all concerned to protect the man
accused of the murder. 1 Two witnessesâ
'Delia . Richardson, Gallagher's sweet
heart, and Jerry Sullivan; one of the own
:>is of the saloonâ held at the City
l'rison as witnesses.
Sullivan, although he was tending bar
when the shooting occurred, denies all
Knowledge of it. The pistol used cannot
hft fouiui^ and Flynn refuses to utter one
word about the case. Delia Richardson
has told all she knows of the affair, but
she was not in the room when the murder
was committed. ! ;
After he was shot Gallagher was placed
in a hack and taken, to his room at 1055
Howard street, a lodging house kept by
Dflla Richardson's mother. He bled .pro
fusely, and a doctor could not be ob
tained, so he was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, : 'where he died. Before he was
removed from Sullivan & Ragget's saloon
the wounded man told his girl. that Flynn
had shot him. Her story of the tragedy
la as follows:
"Jim Gallagher and 1 were In the sa
loon on O'Farrell street several hours.
We had several drinks. Jerry Sullivan,
one of the proprietors, served the liquor
to us behind the portieres which separate
the rear of the saloon from the side bar.
A f=hort time before the shooting 'Mike'
l'lvnn iofhed us. 'Jim' and I were quar
reling, and Flynn Interfered.
"I diii not wnnt to see any trouble, and
ns tile Quarrel did not amount to any
thing I went Into the toilet. I thought
the men .would sUop quarreling when I
j/ot away,- A moment after I left tKe room
â  I .id a pistol shot and went back. Gal
lagher was standing up. I thought the
pistol shot was only a bluff, and I again
left the room. In about two minutes an
other slmt sounded, and I pushed the
door npen mid saw Jim lying on the floor,
liis (Â»(â <â  and neck covered with blood.
"Flynn and Sullivan wore the only men
near him. There were seven or eight men
in the front of the saloon, but none of
them came back where we wore. I turned
to Flynn-and. asked him why ha kihed.
"im, but he did not answer me. He was
not at all excited. Then I bent over Jim
and asked him several times who shot
him. He tried to talk, but could not. His
i#Â£?, at was flll<?(l Wth blood. I asked him
.;V ynn nml the shot, ami he said "ies. 1
borne one called a hack and Jim was
assisted into it. 1 got In, and a strange
man also entered the cab and we were
Unven home. We could not get a doctor,
and tnÂ« patrol wagon was sent for and
Jim was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
During the ride home Jim kept trying to
talk, but 1 could not understand what he
wanted to say. 1 did not see a pistol in
l'lynn's hand, but I believe he did the
shooting."
When the detectives went to the saloon
yesterday fore-noon they could not learn
who was present when the shooting oc
curred. The bartender on watch alleg* '1
entire lgnorar.ee of everything, lie did
noi even know where his employers lived.
The officers threatened to lock up the
place, and. presto! Sullivan's abiding
place was quickly disclosed. He was In
bed at his room at Sls Mason street.
Sullivan told the detectives be knew
nothing of the Bhooting. His evasion of
questions was so marked that Detective
Dillon requested him to go to police head
quarters. Sullivan was taken before Cap
tain Seymour, and his unwillingness to
give information and liis effort M throw
oust in tho eyes of the otÃa rs reaulti
his own Imprisonment. He was put In the
tanks and held as a witness. Captain
Seymour then ordered the arrest ol â 
n In the saloon when Che murder o< -
curred. am' nev< ral officers went out look
ing for them.
Sullivan had the remarkable nerve to
declare he did not know the name of any
person who was In his Baloon 'yesterday
morning. Ho contradicted Delia Rlchurd-
Bon's statement that he was near Gal
lagher when Bhe came into the rear of
iloon after the second shot was tired,
and he dnniod knowing Gallagher or
Fiynn until he was cornered ana It was
Bhown.he was on intimate terms with
both.
All the people connected with the scrape
are known to the police, and some of
them have records. The saloon where the
crime was committed is the resort of the
us of bmh sexes who make their
living by dubious means. Jim Gallagher,
\\\p dead nrin, bore the reputation of be
ing a "bad man." He was one of the
principals In the row In me Second Pre
cinct of the Forty-third Assembly Dis
trict on election day. and was arrested
on a warrant sworn out by Will Ashe for
striking him with brass knuckles.
"Mike" Flynn. whose right name is
John, is a partner of "Billy" Gallagher.
r of the dead man. in the saloon at
irner of Grant avenue and Morton
street. About ten years ago Flynn was
convicted of robbery and sent to the
House of Correction for two years. He
was slated for the position of bailiff in
Police Judge Treadwell's court, and ex
pected to go into office to-dny. He is
the brother-in-law of Police Officer Ma
gee.
Delia Richardson i? the divorced wife
of Percy Glover, and her associates were
nearly all vicious characters. Before Gal
lagher died he toM Police Sergeant Dono
van he Phot himself. But the [act that no
pistol h-..> been found and the immediate
surrender of Flynn after the shooting
clearly Indicate that this is not a case of
suicide. The police believe Jerry Sullivan
disposed of th^> weapon of death. The '
murdered man was a widower. Two chil
dren survive him.
MYSTERIOUS DEATH
IN A LODGING-HOUSE
James McFarland Put to Bed as a
Drunk Found Dead â Other
Sudden Deaths.
Shortly before noon yesterday the
Morgue wafion was telephoned for to at
to a case at 230 Kearny street,
whore the dead body of an unknown man
wns found In a room on the bed.
The case is wrapped in mystery, and
will be turned over to the police for in
gatlon after the new Coroner holds
un autopsy.
From the statement of Mrs. Crawford,
the landlady of the lodging-house, it ap
pears that four men, one of whom is a
back-driver named Less, applied for a
room for a man they said was helplessly
drunk. They were given a room, into
which they carried a man seemingly very
much under the influence of liquor, whom
they placed on the bed without remov
ing his clothing. The men then departed.
hi the. forenoon a servant at the house
found the stranger dead on the bed in
the condition in which his companions had
left him.
At the Morgue Deputy Coroner IJallett
made a careful search of his effects, but
nothing could be found by* which his Iden
tity could be established. In his - ~Kets
we're a number of cards with the name
of the "Califorpia Concrete Company"
printed thereon. In addition to these was
a contract entered into by property-own
.ll Thirteenth street. Los Angeles,
awarding a contract to J. Hem to put
down a concrete sidewalk on that street
between Main street and Grand avenue
for 5 cents a square foot.
No property or money wns found on
his person and as Dr. Gallaghi r did not
i scamine the" body in consequence of his
official term having expired at 12 o'clock
lv.st night, the cause of death is unknown.
' Karly this morning a dispatch wns re
caived from Los Angeles saying that the
unknown man was James McFarland.
Deceased was employed by the cement
i mpany in that city for some time. He
was well educated and is said to have
been a hard drinker. >
At 132 Second street "he dead body of
Theodore M- Bracker, s discharged pri
vate of Company C, Kixth California Vol
unteers, was found on ihe floor of his
bedroom. Bracker bad been imbibing
very freely since his discharge from thÂ«
arniy. on "the 3d of September, and this
is supposed to have been the cause of his
death. He nau been selling tlu horns_
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 2, 1899.
and other toys during the holidays.
Bracker was a native of Maryland and
aged 28 years.
The body of James Barry, whose sui
cide was reported in yesterday's Call, oc
cupied a slab at the Morgue, and early in
the. morning "Jim" Gallagher's remains
were brought in from the Receiving Hos
pital.
About 10 o'clock Maurice Dean, a ship
joiner and a native of England, aged 45
years, drew a razor across his throat in
his room at 376 Lexington avenue. He
severed the jugular vein and made a suc
cessful exit.
SWEENEY WAS AftGBY.
How the New Police Judg* Was Im
pesed Upon by "Ike*' Willis.
Dene Smith, thr noted female pickpock
et who was arrested Saturday night for
vagrancy, but immediately released on
her own recognizance, was re-arrested
la.=t evening. Learning that he had been
imposed upon Judge Sweeney counter
manded his former order releasing the
woman, and instructed Captain Spillane
to take hr-r into custody again. He also
fixed her bond at $1000, which is unusual
in a vagrancy, case.
Bays that a man named "Ike"
Willis, who ia employed around the Jus
tir.-'.s Court, informed him that he had
been Bent by county Clerk Deane to get
an order for the release of the woman.
Not knowing at the time that she was the
notorious pickpocket, he readily signed
the order for her release.
County Clerk Deane Is incensed that
Willis should nave used his name in im
posing on Judge Sweeney, and threatens
to read the "riot act" to "Willis as soon
as he meets him.
THE NEW CORONER
Dr. Ed E. Hill Takes Charge of the
Morgue.
Dr. William .T. Hawkins turned over the
keys of the Morgue to Dr. Edmund E.
Hill at 12 o'clock last night. With wishes
of success the retiring doctor surrendered
the city property to his successor and the
new deputies took charge of the office.
The deputies who will have charge of
the office for the next year are: P. J. Mc-
Cormick, John F. Gately, John D. Sullivan
and Geur^e I.acombe. Dr. John L. Zabala
is the new autopsy surgeon; Dr. <"rack
ton. chemist; John D. Highland, stenog
rapher, and John J. Flannigari. messen
ger. First Deputy Gately stood the morn
ing watch.
Father Jtliordan at St. Ignatius.
An Interesting and instructive sermon
was delivered by Rev. Father Rionlan,
president of Santa Clara "'ollege, last
evening at St. [gnatius Church on the
subject of New Vent's day. The main
address was prefixed with a short dis
course on the BUbject suggested by the
gospel of the day. In the expansion of
the many thoughts brought to mind by
the. annual commemoration of the first
day in the new year the . preacher re
viewed the work of the Jesuit community
of the past, expressing th" hope that
those who have assisted in furthering the
interests of the church will continue their
good work during the course of the new
\.ar. The many recollections of loved
ones who have disappeared from the con
gregation during the past year were
pathetically referred to and the necessity
of a strict conformance to the duties of
the Catholic religion, that all may be
prepared to answer the call of death, was
emphasized. At the conclusion of the ser
mon solemn benediction was celebrated.
Yourg and Drun*.
Carl Chilgren. aged 12 years, living at
521 Stevenson street, was found helplessly
drunk on Btevensot) street last evening.
He was accompanied by two other boys
who claimed they had met him stagger
ing along Jones street near Eddy, and
fearing that he would be arrested, they
decided to take him home.
The helpless boy was immediately re
moved to the Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Toimey relieved him of the liquor
with the aid of a stomach pump. To-day
an effort will bo made to ascertain where
he procured the intoxicant.
New Year's Drunks.
Compared with Christmas thorp was a
considerable diminution In the number of
"drunks" arrested by the police New
Year's morning. Judge Sweeney was at
the prison yesterday morning and dis
charged sixty-five men and women who
! rul imbibed too freely. The Judge gave
some of them timely advice and several
at his request promised to swear off for
a year. At the Receiving Hospital the
chfpp treated were comparatively few and
trilling in nature, being as a rule the re
sult of a light or a fall. The only excep
tion was the ease of James Gallagher,
who was sliot In a saloon at 113 O'Farreli
street, and died. .
Railroad Commissioners.
The new Railroad Commissioners, C. S.
Laumelster, N. Blackstock and E. B.

at the office In the Chronicle building at

They were, among a few others, the
guests of Commissioner Laumeister and
his wife, at a New Year's dinner party at
the at. Nicholas Hotel last night. Com

party, but he was called to Sacramento

EJECTED FROM
THEIR ROME ON
NEW YEAR'S DAY
Sad Misfortune of the
Hurst Family.
FAIL TO PAY THEIR RENT
FURNITURE AND CLOTHING IN
THE STREET.
Mrs. Jeremiah O'Connor Is Dumb to
All Entreaty and Coldly Re
fuses to Allow Them
Shelter.
Mrs. Jeremiah O'Connor, the owner of
the premises situated at the corner of
Julia and Minna streets, commenced the
new year yesterday by turning Charles
W. Hurst, his wife and two children into
the streets because they were unable to
pay the past month's rent. Their furni
ture and clothing were thrown on the
sidewalk, where they now remain, a
ruined heap as a result of exposure to
the heavy rain that came down in tor
rents yesterday morning and afternoon.
Hurst, who is a candymaker by trade,
has been ill for some months and conse
quently has been physically unable to
I work at his business. He has accepted
odd jobs around the various theaters, but
even this work he had to abandon owing
to his falling health.
It is alleged by the neighbors that Mrs.
O'Connor has persecuted Hurst ever since
the time his rent became overdue. It is
stated as a fact that the usual rent of
$8 50 that Hurst paid for the. three rooms
which he and his family occupied at lOVi
Julia streeU-was recently raised to $lio
simply as a pretext to turn him into the
street, the landlady knowing that he had
no money and that his little family was
almost starving.
When seen yesterday afternoon Mrs.
O'Connor gave as an excuse for ejecting'
her tenants that she had her taxes to
pay, adding ironically that she didn't care
for Hurst anyway, as he was absolutely
"no good"; that ho was noted for his
faculty of attempting to "beat every
body," as Bhe expressed it. that he had
the least dealings with. This is positively
denied, however, by the neighbors who
were intimately acquainted with the un
fortunate man. They give Mrs. O'Connor J
the reputation of being of a quarrelsome '
and meddlesome naturo and assert that
pho is constantly trying to find fault with
all her tenants on the l<\ist provocation.
Where the members of the Hurst family
are "at present is unknown, as they have i
completely disappeared since they were
ejected from their home. It is thought
by some that they are bring cared for by
the Salvation Army, as one of its repre
sentatives called upon them shortly be
fore the Sheriff and his men began the
work of removing their property to the
street. Their clothes and furniture are
still where they were thrown in a heap
under the supervision of the O'Connor
woman.
In all probability the unfortunate fam
ily will be assisted by one of the char
itable institutions of the city until Hurst
is able to resume his work.

THE TRAGEDIES OF A DAY
TEMPESTUOUS OPENING OF THE
YEAR IN THIS CITY.
Four Eukides. a Murder and a Fire
the Record â Special Services
of Music in All the
Churches.
There were many hoarse voices and
tired limps nursed by the men and women
yesterday who on the previous night had
contributed their sharo to the deafening
I noise with which the new year was uah
! ered in. As the years go by the noise
seems to gain in volume and the carnival
spirit, ever present, seems to take on a
I more robust form. With all this the fun,
j which is fast and furious, results in no
I bodily injuries. The custom of masking
developed unexpected proportions.
The new year was not favored with the
j customary California weather. Instead
I of the sunshine with which* the first day
j is usually introduced there came the more
i welcome Bhowers to moisten the earth
and give fresh impetus to the growth of
grass and trees and the esehseholtzia,
yeltow-petaled emblem of California.
The Inclemency of the weather pre
cluded any holiday milking, so people
settled down by comfortable hearth
| stones. Under the spell of the glowing
j coals new leaves were turned over in the
1 book of life and good resolutions recorded
for observance during the year to come.
The streets were practically deserted
during the day. giving an unnatural quiet
to the city. The custom of making New
Year's calls on a large scale seemed to
have fallen into disuse, owing to abuses
of hospitality that crept in when all
classes of society kept open-house and
many entertained lavishly.
The day was not without its tragedies.
One unfortunate ended his life on the
stroke of twelve by shooting himself.
Four others followed his pitiful example
before the sun went down. In addition
to these there was the Inevitable murder,
result of a saloon brawl where dulled
senses were quick to resent fancied in
sult By a curious coincidence the trage
dies' of the day were the same in number
and character as those enacted justayear
ago To complete the resemblance a
general alarm of fire was sounded late
In the afternoon for a conflagration
down in the manufacturing district.
Reliclous services in honor of the new
year were celebrated generally in the
churches throughout the city. In many
places of worship the ceremony was
similar to that solemnized on Christmas
day particularly In the rendition of spe
cially arranged programmes of sacred
"Yn'Yhe Catholic churches solemn high
mass was celebrated in the morning.
i Vespers and benediction followed in the
evening and concluded the services In
honor of the day. _
At St. Mary's Cathedral an eloquent
sermon ' was 'delivered by Archbishop
Riordan before a great congregation.
I The usual text, cited from the gospel of
the day, was set aside for the appro
priate subject of New Year's day and
the happenings and sorrow which are in
evitably linked together as the old year
passes into a memory and the new is
! ushered in burdened with the uncer
tainty of fate.
In expanding this thought the preacher
reviewed the changes that have been
! wrought In the old year and spoke of
i those which will come during the course
lof tbo new. He dwelt pathetically on
the subject of the faithful Catholics in
the cathedral parish who have passed
away into the great unknown since the
last celebration of New Years and spoke
of the inevitable call of death that will
probably claim many of the congregation
present at yesterday's services. In view
of this uncertainty the preacher em
phasized the necessity of a strict con
formance with duty demanded by the
Catholic church from all of its members.
FOUGHT FOUR POLICEMEN.
A Desperate Ex-Convict Wrecks a
Cell in the City Prison.
Jesse Grant, an ex-convict, created a
disturbance at the masquerade ball in the
Mechanics' Pavilion early yesterday
morning and when a police officer at
tempted to eject him he struck the officer
with his clenched fist. The officer quickly
seized him and in the struggle that fol
lowed Grant was thrown to the floor, lie
still continued to fight, however, and it
required four policemen to land him in
prison. After he was formally charged
with battery and disturbing the peace he
became abusive to the arresting officers
and was thrown in the dark cell. When
he was taken out several hours later Cor
poral Hickey discovered that he had com
pletely wrecked the inside of th^ cell.
He was then thrown back into the dun
geon until last evening, when a woman
visited the prison and asked to sco him.
She had two orders of release signed by
Judge Low. Grant was taken out of the
cell and was at once recognized by Cap
tain Seymour.
Incensed at the action of the Police
Judge in ordering Grant's release on his
own recognizance, Seymour immediately
telephoned to him and asked him if he
had not made a mistake in signing an
order for the release of Grant. Low, evi
dently realizing he had made a mistake,
countermanded the order and raised the
bonds of the prisoner.
"Business 1 ' the Subject.
The meeting of the Theosophlcal Soci
ety, which was held last evening- in the
building of the Academy of Sciences, was
a public one and there was a large atten
dance The subject of the evening was
"Business," and the speaker was Mr.
Julius Oettl. He handled his subject in a
logical and concise style and was given
the closest attention.
A New Year Dance.
The entertainment and social at the
Temple on Turk street last night, which
concluded with a dance, was a most en
joyable affair. It was under the auspices
of the Progressive Social Club. A large
number of people enjoyed the dance,
which was kept up until a late hour.

MRS. BOTKIN
IS BROKEN
IN SPIRIT
Overwrought Nerves
Have Given Way.
A MAD BURST OF PASSION
SHE ATTACKS ALL CONNECTED
WITH THE CASE.
Every Loophole in the Law Will Be
Taken Advantage Of in an
Attempt to Free the
Woman.
The overwrought nerves of Mrs. Cor
delia Botkin have at last given way un
der the strain to which they have been
subjected during the past four months.
Contrary to the Information first given
out by her attendants, the condemned
wbouflr^aollapaed completely after reach
ing the branch Jail on Friday night. She
was delirious, and in her mad ravings at
tacked everybody even remotely connect
ed with the case in which she has been
the central figure. The vehemence of her
actions and of her denunciations left her
a limp and weak figure of distress.
She had not recovered from this yester
day, and Bhe remained in her bed all day.
Her sisters, who have not left her side
since the verdict of the jury was rendered,
ministered carefully tv her wants, antici
pating her wishes and endeavoring to dis
tract her attention as much as possible
from the events of the past fe-w days.
During the afternoon Senator Frank
McGowan, who was associated with j
George Knight in the defense of the I
woman, called at the jail and spent some !
time with his client. Mrs. Botkin entered
into a general discussion of the case in \
all its phases, and was interested in j
learning of the Btepa to be taken looking
toward securing her freedom. Her attor
neys have already outlined their plan of |
Campaign, the first move m winch will be
made on Saturday next. That Is the time '
Jixed by Judge Carroll Cook for the pass
ing of sentence, and a motion for a new
trial Will then he made, it is seldom v
Judge grants this application, so the
Supreme Court will then be appealed to I
fr.r relief. When the case goes to the
highest tribunal every question the at- .
torneys can raise in on with it
will 1 â  on. These will
Include not only x\u- qu< s:;<iiis which nave
developed during the course of the trial
but will alsn include the matter of the
Jurisdiction of California courts in pass-:
Ing upon the celebrated castr. The attor
for .Mrs. Botkin express no fear as j
tv what the outcome of their appeal will
beâ th< . .. their client to be granted
her f n i dom. .
Tht- attorneys for the defense have been
casting about for reasons that would ex
plain . . i rdlct and have found an
other fact to add to those aln adyaddui
There were :;n unusual number of Jews
cm the jury, and the friends of the pris
oner took this a> a good omen, as the
men of ih;it race are known to frown
down anything that looks like oppres
sion. They thought this characteristic
would be a point in favor of their \
Client, but there is another trait in the
Jewish character even more strongly (
marked, and that is the high value they â¢
place on commercial honor.
It was on this rock the defense' was !

''DAYS THAT ARE NO MORE." !
Rev. William Rader Preaches an Ap
propriate New Year's Sermon.
The Rev. William Rader of the Third
Congregational Church preached an ap
propriate New Year's day sermon yester- |
day, taking for his subject a line from
Tennyson's "Tears, Idle Tears," namely,
"The days that are no more."
Jir spoke of the great events of the past
year, notably of the war with Spain, and
of the brilliant victories on land and sea
achieved by the American army and navy.
He referred ;:lso to the deaths of Glad- j
stone and Bismarck, and of the great i
lot.s which England and Germany suf- I
fered thereby.
"Life," be said, "is not absolute in its '
length, but always relative. Abraham '
Lincoln lived longer than Methusali m,
and in the last year McKJnley lived i'Â«'
Abrahamic years, if we Judge from what
he has undergone in the [ate war. We
Judge life not only by its length, but by |
its depth; that is. by the amount of good
that is accomplished in it.
"There arc two types of old age.
Shakespeare's "King bear' was a fright- j
ful example of disappointed old a^e, while
on the other hand John Greenleaf Whu- j
tier was a miracle of poetic art and his '
was peacefulness itself, no morbid ;
anxiety or apprehension.
"There is great necessity for us to make :
right use of our moments, foi we cannot
i ate ourselves from eternity, it is our
duty to inv> st our time with the highest
ani! best that it within us."
in the evening the cantata "Light of i

Miss Hutchinson, Miss ParEer, Miss Hull,

"The Beginning and the End."
There were appropriate services yester
day in the Church of Bt. John the
Evangelist. In the morning a Sunday
school service was held and an address
wsf delivered by M. Arundel of England.
Service with a sermon was celebrated at
11 a. m.
Rev. B. R. Sprtulding took for his text the
thirteenth verse, twenty-first chapter of
Revelations: "U Am Alpha and Omega,
the Beginning and the End," especially !
appropriate for the closing of the old and
the commencement of the new year, when
another volume of life's history has been
closed. "It is then that we say," said
the divine, "what I 'have written is writ
ten and it cannot be changed." There
may be leaves in the book that we would

may not be altered. It Is well to think
what the past year has been to us, with
Its joys and sorrows, its sunshine and
clouds, and that we may begin the new
year with better hopes, better endeavors
more usefulness. Let us begin It with
Christ, who is the "Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end."

tended, cut the Gang Violated

Critics.
The torrent of abuse and vilification
launched at Judge Belcher by the gang
members of the Board of Education at
its session Saturday night was generally
commented on yesterday, and the com
ments were by no means favorable to the
men whose disgusting lack of decency is
regarded on all sides as an appropriate
finale to the corruption which has ren
dered the school department a reproach
and a djsgraee to San Francisco.
One feature of Saturday evening's
proceedings, and one only, is regarded
with some degree of satisfaction. That
is the action of the board in having en
tered on its records the filthy language
usrii by the Directors in denouncing
Judge Belcher. The Judge's friend? say
no better monument to the character of
the present Board of Education could
have been devised. Judge Belcher re

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIL, MONDAY, JANUARY 2, 1899.
TO BE DEDICATED TO-DAY.
DURING the past week the ladies who
have charge of the Home of the
Board of Relief of the Native Daugh
ters of the Golden West, at 935 O'Far
rell street, have been busy In the work of
completing the arrangements that are
necessary to place it in first-class condi
tion for the reception of those who will
enjoy its hospitality. The committee that
has charge of the matter of arranging
for the reception, which will be held to
day, and at which the home will be for
mally turned over to the board, has also
been busy In the line of the ceremonies
that will mark the event, and will make
It one of the most interesting in the his
tory of the order.
The accompanying illustration repre
sents an exterior view of the home and
portraits of the self-sacrificing ladies who
have, by their counsel and energies, done
so much to insure the success of this no
ble enterprise. Tnese ladles are Mrs. Tina
L. Kane, the first president of the Grand
Parlor and president of the board: Mrs.
Lena H. Mills, present grand president;
Past Grand President Miss Mariana Ber
tola, one of the many bright minds of the
order; Miss Mac B. Wilkin, the vice presi
to allow the people to judge between
them.
"While the action of the board in rush
ing through a large number of transfers
ami promotions in the closing days of its
term, thereby entailing greater expense
on the school department and further
crippling it in its present pitiful condi
tion, is taken by some to indicate that
the injunction issued by Judge Belcher
had not served its purpose, the contrary
Is the case. The injunction was applied
for to prevent the board from appointing
forty or more additional teachers, entail
ing an annual increased expense of about
$200,000. This object was accomplished.
Those who applied for the Injunction did
not dream that the gang members of t.ie
board would commit such a flaerant
breach of trust and violate their sworn
duty in order to spite tlu>ir critics, but
even if this could have been anticipated
it is regarded as extremely doubtful
whether the court could have interfered
in the discharge of what might have con
stituted the necessary duties of the
board had they performed the same hon
estly and judiciously. It was feared that
an attempt to restrain the board from
performing duties which under certain
circumstances or conditions arising might
bf-como accessary, would not stand the
test of law if brought to an issue, and
rather than take the chance of hav
ing the application for an injunction re
fused because more than the law provided
was asked, the petitioners decided not
to include the question of transfers of
teachers. The gang simply saw the open
ing and crept in.
It remains to be seen whether the new
board will attempt to undo the work of the
old board. Director-elect Stow said last
night that if the new board found
that there were more teachers in the de
partment than were required the direct
ors would probably find a way to gt rid
of the surplus.
"No business man would think of keep
ing a number of men in his employ when
he had nothing for them to do," said Mr.
Stow, "and I see no reason why the School
Department should pay teachers for do
ing nothing. I cannot say just what will
be done, but if there is a surplus of
teachers some of them will probably be
discharged, and they can ask the courts
to decide whether our action is legal or'
j not."
Mr. Stow expressed the opinion that the
incoming board would endeavor to serve
the city and county honestly and do wnat
th^y could to redeem the department from
the disgrace at present attaching to it.
If any of the new members were inclined
to emulate the example of their predeces
sors he was confident they would find
themselves In the minority.
"If Mr. Bergerot is elected president of
the hoard." he said in conclusion, "I shall
1 give him my hearty support to secure a
clean administration of the affairs of the
department."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. I.â Doubt is ex
pressed that Ed Smith, who is held in
Burlington, lowa, is the San Jose mur
derer, James C. Dunham, for whom a
reward of $11,000 is offered. This doubt
is increased by the information given
by A. J. Altamarino Jr., who is the
superintendent of extensive San Luis
gold mines in Lower California. Alta
marino, who has recently returned from
the property, said:
"On my last trip I stopped at the
ranch of Juan Otero, who related the
incident of a stranger appearing in that
country dressed in a Prince Albert coat
and with a brownish beard and stran
gling: hair. He carried a wicker-covered
demijohn. The howling of the dogs at
tracted Otero's attention, as the ap
pearance of a stranger on foot in that
country is unusual unless he is a fugi
tive from justice. The stranger ac
cepted food, but did not speak. He
avoided a direct look and acted sub
niciously. The next day he departed.
The incident was recalled when Otero
received a full description of Dunham
from the Mexican authorities at Mazat
lan. This was in Spanish and taken
fr^m those sent out by the California
authorities. The description, including
that of the teeth, corresponded with
that of the stranger who had mysteri
ously appeared and gone in the direc
tion of the <Julf of Lower California,
thirty miles from the ranch.
"Otero and his men went prospecting
toward the coast a few months later.
The dogs scented an object on a sand
dune in the midst of a dreary cacti
covered desert. Investigation revealed
a skeleton and a few pieces of coat
cloth and the demijohn carried by the
stranger. The coyotes had done the
rest.
"From my many conversations with
Otero upon the subject, and from the
descriptions given, I am convinced that
Dunham is no more, and that Otero
was the last man to see him alive. So
positive am I of this that Otero has
been instructed to fetch in all that re
mains of the body and we shall en
deavor to claim the reward."
DETERMINED TO
ENFORCE REFORMS
Empress Dowager of China Sends a
Warning to Viceroys and
Governors.
PEKING, Jan. I.â An imperial edict,
issued last Friday, remarks that China is
"passing through a severe crisis in her
history." It reminds Viceroys and Gov
ernors of the numerous edicts that have
been issued lately, ordering administra
tive reforms; points out that many of
these have not been observed, and com
mands the immediate . institution of re
forms in the method of training troops, in
agriculture, in manufacture and every
thing liKely to conduce to the prosperity
of the empire. It directs the Viceroy's
and Governors to memorialize the throne
within a month that these reforms have
been inauguraed.
This edict is highly significant as show
ing that the Empress Dowager realizes
that the situation is serious and that all
hope of the country's future lies solely in
reform. _j

SACRAMENTO STRAIGHTENED
PUBLIC WORKS COMMISSION
. ER LEASE'S REPORT.
Splendid Achievements of This De
partment Receive the Praise
of Government Engi
neer Meuer.
Special Dlssatch to ThÂ» Call. .
SACRAMENTO, Jan. I.â Ed E.
Leake, Commissioner of Public Works,
has filed with Governor Budd a report
of the work done under the direction of
his department for a period of twenty
months, beginning March 7, 1897, and
ending November 17, 1898. The reports
of Chief Engineer M. A. Nunse and As
sistant Engineer G. N. Handle, as well
as the report of the auditing board, are
made a part of Commissioner Leake' s
report.
The commissioner's report states that
in accordance with the plans outlined by
his report of November 16, 1895, the
Elkhorn easement, a concrete weir 2000
feet in length and 15 feet in width, has
been completed, and Major W.H. Heuer,
the Government engineer in charge
of the navigable rivers of California,
Indorses it as the best and cheapest
work of its character in the United
States. The report informs the Gov
ernor that the jetty system of removing
j Newtown shoals has also been complet
; cd. It comprises five jetties, aggregiu
| Ing about six thousand feet in length.
This work has been inspected by Major
Heuer. He pronounces it as the most
substantial and least expensive work
of its character that has ever come un
der his observation during his many
years service on the Mississippi, Mis
souri, Ohio and Delaware, Hudson and
j Sacramento rivers. In a public speech
he declared that he "never knew or
better work being done or more honesty
shown in the use of materials: that h<Â»
had never seen anything to equal the
work either at the easement or the
jetty system; never so much and such
good work for the amount of money
expended: that the $80,000 expended
showed more substantial results than
he had ever witnessed from a similar
expenditure.
Commissioner Leake expresses the
belief that the effect of these two Im
provements will be to deepen and cor
rect the channel of the Sacramento
river, increase its carrying capacity
and greatly facilitate the disposal of
flood waters.
The report states that the Secretary
of War has granted permission to make
five cutoffs on the San Joaquin rive*.
Contracts have been let for the con
struction of all these cuts except one.
One cutoff has been completed, and an
other nearly so. Two others will be
completed by the middle of February.
The report refers to the testimony of
the oldest navigators that the work al
ready performed has vastly improved
the San Joaquin River, and their predic
tion that when all the work now under
contract is completed the river will b*
in an almost perfect condition.
The report cites H. J. Corcoran, thtÂ»
steamboat owner and chairman of thÂ»
auditing board, as authority for the
statement that when the work now proÂ»
Jected is completed there will be a wa
terway on the San Joaquin River al
most perfectly straight from Crozier&
to deep water.
The report estimates that to complete
the work now under contract will bring:
the total expenditure up to $130,000,
which will leave a balance in the appro,
priation of $170,000.
Commissioner Leake recommends
that the jurisdiction of the Commis
sioner of Public Works and the audit
ing board should be extended so as to
include all of the Sacramento River, al
so the San Joaquin, Feather and Tuo
lumne rivers, and Petaluma, Alviso and
Napa creeks. As the law now stands
the money appropriated can be e.x
pended on only the San Joaquin an-i
Sacramento rivers from the mouth
of the Feather to Suisun Bay.
The expenditure of a- very moderate
amount on the Feather River and on the
Sacramento above the mouth of the
Feather would vastly improve the* nav
igability of both, and Incidentally af
ford protection to a large area of fer
tile country. The expenditure of $30,
--000 would make a deep-water channel
of Alviso Creek almost to San Jose.
The importance of such an Improve
ment cannot be overestimated. The
farmers and fruit growers of . Santa
Clara Valley would save more than the
cost in one year In the matter of trans
portation. Like improvements on other
creeks enumerated would result In
material advantages which would not
only affect the country traversed by
them, but which would be shared by
the people of the entire State. If It be
comes^ fixed policy of the State to
care for her navigable strams upon the
lines of recommendations made in hts ]
report, says the commissioner, the Leg
islature should make an additional ap
propriation of $100,000.
The report concludes with the state
ment that it is the belief of the com
missioner that his department has ac
complished all that could reasonably be
expected from it. and further that an
indorsement from a man of such ex
perience as Major Heuer ought to satis
fy all fair minded taxpayers that the
department has been diligent, thoroueh
and economical in the discharge of Its
duties.
The report of Engineers Nunse and
Randall treats extenslvelv of the work
done by them on the rivers under the
direction of the commissioners. An
argument is made sustaining the action
of the denartment in using a Part of the.
appropriation in the construction of
needed works on the rivers rather than
expending it all on the â¢-.â  purchase' of a
drede^r. which could not b*Â»v*Â» been op
erated except at great additional ex-,
pens?. - -
COUNTIES SETTLE
WITH THE STATF
!t*ay Into the Treasury the Money
Collected on Account of State â¢
Taxes.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. I.â Fifty-two
County Treasurers/ of California have
completed â¢ settlements with Controller
Colgan and paid into the State treasury
the money collect on account of State
taxes. It is acknowledged that The Call's
timely and thoroi:*h expose of the scheme
concocted by shrewd attorneys to defeat
settlements 'u\>?-t the calculations of the
schemers and thought about the desired*
adjustment between the County Treasur
ers and the State. To-niprht there Is more
than three million dollars in the State
treasury. "WBen The Call exposed the
scheme two *eeks ago the amount was
; less than, a li*iÂ£ million, and the prospect
of additional payments seemed remote
and uncertain. Only five counties are de
linquent in settlement, and their affairs
will soon be adjusted to the satisfaction
of the Controller.
Spared Because of Youth.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. I.â On account of
his youth and the suffering caused his
parents by the exposure of his folly, the
firm of Knlttel & Williams decided not to
prosecute young Edward Mastrup for
having opened their safe several times

Two men, officers of tlfe ship Indiana and steamer Roanoke, took the ship's boat and started on a hunting expedition yesterday morning. Luckily
they had a email duck boat in tow or they would not now be alive to tell the tale. They started for Suisun Bay and when between Goat Island and
Long Wharf, Oakland, a squall struck the boat and she was upset. The men were weighted down with their long boots and cartridge belts and
would have sunk had they not seized the duck boat and held on until they were washed ashore on the Berkeley mud flats. The ship's boat sank,
but one of the men had the presence of mind to cut the painter that fastened it to the duck boat before it went down.

Barge In Collision With Schooner
, Queen â Ferryboats Late and
Commuters Have a
Lively Time.
There were wild times on the water
front yesterday. The new year opened
up with a southeaster and the shipping
from the ferries to the mail dock caught
.it. The ferry boats ran at irregular in
tervals and the passengers who crossed
the bay on them had good lively times.
On the Piedmont one of the chain boxes
used for ballast broke adrift and caused
the steamer to give a lurch that made
everybody think she was going over. Just
at that moment a rain squall struck her
and a big sea broke aboard over the bow,
BO.it was no wonder some of the passen
gers began to say their prayers. The
master mechanic from the Oakland yard
â  was aboard and he superintended the
making fast of the derelict ballast box,
and the Piedmont made her berth without
any further mishap.
The new ferry steamer Berkeley ran
throughout the day and strange to say
made better weather of it than did the
Newark, Encinal and Piedmont. Occa- !
sionally a sea would break over her, but
Hhe seemed to stand up to the gale in a
workmanlike manner. In order to cross
the bay the ferry boats had to face the
storm, so it took them twice the usual
time to make each trip.
Two men named Merry and Henderson
nearly lost their lives during the gale.
Their boat capsized between Goat Island
and Long Wharf, Oakland, and had it not
been for a little hunting skiff that they
held onto they would assuredly have been
drowned.
Merry is- an officer on the American ship
Indiana and Henderson Is an officer on
the steamer Koanoke. Both vessels are
laid up in Oakland Creek. Saturday the j
two men made up their minds to go duck
hunting and the excursion was set for ;
yesterday morning. A fine new boat, I
which cost $200, had just been supplied
the Indiana and the men decided to take
it. As the hunting would be done in |
Sulsun Bay a hunting boat was taken ;
along, in order that the hunters might be j
able to follow the ducks into shallow ,
water. , ...
Merry and Henderson were armed with >
new breech-loading guns for the occasion
and when they stepped into the ships
boat they had on their cartridge bells and
long boots. . * _
All went well until they were off Goat
Island and close to the, training ship
Adams and British â  ship Scottish Hills
when a sudden squall struck the boat, a ;
big wave broke aboard and over she |
went. With great presence of mind Mer
ry cut the painter that held the hunting
boat and the two men clung to it.
Their long boots were full of water and
the cartridge belts weighed them down so
that It was Impossible to get into the
cockleshell. They yelled for assistance,
but the roar of the wind drowned their
cries. After drifting about for a whiles
the ship's boat sank and an hour later
the hunting boat, with the two men cling
ing to it, drifted ashore on the Berkeley
flats.
After getting their blood In circulation :
the two men did not wait for a change
of clothing, but came direct to San Fran- !
cisco. They hired Henry Peterson's
launch Amy. and Captain Wilson took
them to the scene of their disaster. For
two hours a search for the ship's boat
was kept up and-then they came back to
the city. .After changing their clothes
they crossed the bay again with the in- i
tention of patrolling the Berkeley beach
until the boat comes ashore.
In Mission Bay the full force of the ;
Btonn was felt. A barge broke adrift and !
ranged down alongside the schooner.
Queen. The latter yessel was consider
ably chafed before the tug Alert could
take hold of the barge and tow her to a
place of safety.
The bark Coloma and the ship Falls of i
Clyde were to have gone to sea, but as j
the wind Shows signs of changing around I
to the southwest the captains decided to j
postpone the sailing day. Captain Han- j
gen was ashore and the Coloma was lying j
off Vallejo-street wharf. For three hours
he tried to prevail on various boatmen to
take him to his ship, but It was only
when the wind went down a little that
! one of them would venture out.
The ship Reaper was to have moved
out into the stream and the steamer Mor
gan City was to have moved from Harri
son to Eolsom-street wharf, but tHe
southeaster kept them at their berths.
The steamers Cnilkat from Eureka, Pro- I
tection from Seattle and Wellington from \
Nanaimo, B. C, were all due yesterday, I
but failed to get in, while the old Gipsy i
from Moss Landing came : in ahead of |
time.
The steam launches from the training |
ship Adams, coast survey steamer Me-
Arthur and gunboat Wheeling all came
in during the morning and tied up at
Folsom-street wharves. They did not
venture out again during the day.
The first vessel to arrive in the riew
year was the steamer Charles Nelson
from Seattle. She made port just as the
gale was beginning. The first and only
vessel to leave port in the new year was
the steamer Umatilla for Puget Sound
ports.
The tugs Alert and Transit have fin
ished the laying of the new Government
cable between the military reservations.
From the Presidio it was laid to Lime
Point, then to Sausalito, â¢ then to Angel
Island and finally to Alcatraz. The old
cable from Black Point to Alcatraz has
been taken up, as vessels were constantly
dragging down on it and getting their
anchors foul.
Captain Hatfleld. formerly of the British
ship Lancing and later of the defunct
Alaska-Yukon Transportation Company,
has gone back to his old love. Up has ac
cepted the command of the Hawaiian
bark Star of Russia and is now on his
way to Hawaii for a load of sugar.
The steamer Alcatraz arrived from
Newport South yesterday in tow of the
Alcazar. It will be remembered that the
Alcatraz broke down during the recent
norther and was driven south. She was
towed Into Newport by the Alcazar and
has now come here to have a new shaft
put In. -
AT THE PARK AND CLIFF.
Pleasure Resorts Deserted on New
Years Day.
San Francisco's people passed the glad
New Year day seated at their firesides.
Owing to the rain and tempest the park
was deserted. The policemen even re
mained indoors. They expected no crowd
and they were right, for no crowd came.
A few people braved the etorm and went
to the Cliff House, where behind the glass
shelter they watched the battle of the
elements for hours.
It was a dull initial day at the pleasure
places, but during this year lively times
are anticipated.
Superintendent of the Park McClaren
states that work will begin Immediately
on a big artificial lake near the end of
the speed track. Over 30,000 cubic yards
of dirt will be removed during the exca
vation, which, it is thought, will be com
pleted by ApriL As soon as the lake la
finished other extensive Improvements
will be Inaugurated.
Considering the weather, very good
crowds visited the Chutes and Sutro'-s
Baths. Folowing are the results of the
contests at the baths: 50-yard dash for

second. 100-yard dash, juvenileâ H. See

THE REALM OF SPORTS.
Many Interesting Events to Take
Place in the Near Future.
The new year was ushered in with many
bright prospects for the realm of sports.
Interest in pugilism has been revived, as
has been demonstrated by the many ex
hibitions which have taken place in the
last year.
Manager Groom says the biggest event
I in the near future would be a fight be
twr-en Corbett and Jeffries. No definite
' steps have yet been made to bring the
i two men together, but they were anxious
i to meet in the ring in San Francisco if
satisfactory arrangements could be made,
the light to take place some time in the
I month of February.
George Green will remain here and will
' not go East, as was reported. He will
I make another match to take place in this
: city some time in March if he can get
: some well known Eastern pugilist of his
own weight to give him battle.
Creedon has not decided what he will
I do, but one thing is sureâ he will never
; regain his old form, owing to his lame
1 ankle, which was broken in a previous
; fight. He has never really recovered
from the accident. Even up to last Fri
i!:<v, the date he met Green, he still fa
vored the ankle and was afraid It might
go back on him at any time.
Yesterday's Handball Sports.
New Year's day was observed in Phil
Ryan's handball court at 858 Howard
street by eleven double settos between the

wealthy man. He is the president of the
Southern Idaho Fruit Growers' Associa

organizations of its kind in existence.

BIG FAVORITES
SIDETRACKED
AT INGLESIDE
A Good Day for the
Shortenders.
HEAVEN'S FLOODGATES OPEN
7 HE COURSING EXCELLENT NOT
WITHSTANDING.
Open, Sapling and Puppy Stakes Will
Be Run Off To-Day â Some Good
Hatches Are on the
Card.
' There was a large crowd at Ingleside
Coursing Park yesterday, considering the
condition of the weather. The dogs
splashed through the large pools of water
and the coursing, in the main, surprised
everybody. Tha little hares darted over
the ground, and, in most of the courses,
gave the dogs all the exercise they de
sired. They seldom reached the slips,
however, but succeeded in keeping on the
ground for over a minute, in many in
stances, before the heavy ground began
to tell upon them.
The pool men say that betting was up
to snuff and dollars in largo quantities
were risked on the favorites, particularly
at the first stage of the game. When the
tide of affairs turned after the course be
tween Las Palmas and Rusty Gold, the
sacks of coin were laid down on the short
enders.
The day was an Inning for the short
enders and some pretty good money was
picked up. Some of the leading favorites
at the park went down, probably owing
to the torrents of rain which were falling.
Among them were Moondyne 11, Gladia
tor and Hotstuff. The most money waa
pulled down on Leonora, who was a flve
to-one short end against Moondyne 11.
No pools were sold -tm the course be
tween Vigilant and Billy Gladstone, as it
was discovered that one of the dogs was
blind in one eye. One of the longest
tussles occurred between Pet Kirby and
Miss Alice. The score was 11 to 9 in fa
vor of Pet Kirby. The pretty work was
all . done immediately in front of the
grand stand, and, as there was a sack of
money at stake, the clever tricks per
formed by each bitch brought forth en
thusiastic applause from their respective
backers.
Eight dogs were billed for the sapling
stake and six for the puppy stake. It
was the intention of the managers of the
park to run off each of these stakes yes
terday, but they were continur-d until to
day, when they will be llnished before the
open stake will commence. Prospects
point to a '-cry successful day and the
pairs of dogs which are on the card as a
result of yesterday's run down will keep
the betting fraternity" guessing. The
ground will probably be in good condition
and the hares are fleet as arrows. Tha

CORINTHIANS GIVE A
NEW YEAR'S DINNER
YACHTSMEN FEAST IN TIBURO*. :
CLUB HOUSE. |
i
Well-Known Tars Lend Helping
Hands as Cooks, Walters and
Salad Makers.
Not a whit daunted by the southerly
storm and driving rain of yesterdayâ no
yachtsman fears anything wet â the Cor
inthians held their thirteenth annual din- !
nee at Tiburon yesterday. A goodly crowd
of members met in the club-house during
the morning and at about 1:30 p. m. the
discussion of the bountiful menu began. | (
The bill of fare, upon a piece of canvas |
I In the shape of a mainsail, set forth the I
I following good things: SB'S
Concoctedâ Gallic appetizer.
Smokedâ
Saltedâ Olives a la traitÂ© de Paris.
Compoundedâ old Scandinavian fer
tilizer, like your Norse progenitor used to
make.
Importedâ dulce, Pedro Ximenez, '
vintage of 18??. - V:.:
Bakedâ Mallard with adjuncts, suckling
: pig with accessories, turkey and depend- j
1 encies, Wisconsin goose with confederates. }
Boiledâ Salinas spuds, prepared accord- |
ing to a secret process; sweet potatoes. j
Fermentedâ Cabernet, Riesling and Sau
terne.
Infusedâ noir, affording a glimpse |
of the Corinthian grounds in Java. '
Curedâ Cut navy plug and cigars.
The salad was made by the deft hands
of L. B. Chapman. Hawks officiated as i
turkey carver, Denhard as duck carver,
Gorter as pig carver and Ramson as
goose carver. The waiters were Thorn- i
ton (described as president of the Cooks'
and Waiters' Union, Madera Parlor, Cor- I
inth), Short, Buck, Howe, Schober and
H. W.-Westorfeld. '
! When the black coffee came round Com
modore Carl Westerfeld rose and In a few , '
well-chosen words alluded to the loss the
club has sustained by the death of its | '
untiring and capable secretary, the late j
E. B. l,athrop, a young man dear to all '
yachtsmen for his kindness and geniality
and respected for his knowledge of yacht
ing and all that pertains to the sport.
After the commodore came W. Mines,
who in an amusing and clever speech al- (
luded to the impossibility of doing any- J
thing nowadays without the necessity of ; (
a stamp. If you write a letter you must |
stamp it; sign a check, it must be | (
stamped; buy a new pair of boots, you
must stamp to get your feet into them; i
your wine must be stamped, your tobacco I
and whisKy, too. Next "Billy" Hines j i
gave the rag-time song "Ziz-ze-zum-zum- J
zum," and by special request his famous (
laughing song. ,
T. F. Tracy, ex-commodore and ex- (
owner of the sloop Secret, spoke for the
old-times and urged upon the members i
the necessity of standing by the admin
istration and being Corinthians through i
and through. Frank Mitchell entertained
the company with speech and song and '
was followed by George Croal in the
"Little Irish Maid," by ' Doc" Emmons
with a recitation and by a whistling per
formance. C. B. Hill, secretary of the
San Francisco Yacht Club, spoke as a
representative of Sausalito yachtsmen ; â¢
and made a kindly allusion to the late ' â¢
secretary of the Corinthians. â¢
More songs and speeches followed and '
all thoroughly enjoyed the generous hos
pitality of the Tiburon yachtsmen. Thus ; ,
ended a most agreeable and successful !
reunionâ the first event of the yachting
season of 1899.

HOW OAKLAND
HAS ELECTED
HER MAYORS
Only Two Have Had a
Majority.
DAVIE LEADS ALL OF THEM
TIME TO CONSIDER THOSE RE
MARKS OF CUVELLIER. '.
John A. Britton's Action Suggests
the Need of a Guardianâ
Corporation With a
Soul.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 1.
A glance at the number of votes cast !
Tor the candidates for Mayor since 18S7 !
knows many instructive facts. Many men
who have been considered . "popular" |
polled very small comparative votes. Dr. j
Pardee was elected by the smallest vote ;
cast for a Mayor In the period named, |
with but one exception, ' yet Pardee is
often spoken of as a candidate who swept '
all before him. In 1893 Pardee was t the â¢
choice of 2726 voters, while J. L. Davle se
cured 232S and R. M. Fitzgerald 2191. The ;
only vote for Mayor. lower than that of i
Dr. Pardee was that of C. D. Pierce (D.),
who was elected in ISSS with 2376 votes.
The highest vote ever received by any ;
candidate for Mayor was that of John
L. Davie on the Populist ticket in 1895,
when he got 455."? votes, against Nelson .!
(R.), who received 3881, over 1100 more
than was necessary to elect Pardee two
years previously. M. C. Chapman and j
J. 1.,. Davie were the only Mayors who
ever received a majority of all the votes |
cast. In ISSy Chapman received 4317 votes
nut of 6SOO cast. Mayor Thomas- was
elected by 3061 out of about 9Gooâ less tuari .
one-third". The uncertainty of party
votes is shown by the Republican fig
ures. which were, in ISS7, 2761; in 1888, 2309;
In 1889, 4317; in 1593, 746; in 1895, 3881; in
1817, 3061. The Democratic vote shows j
remarkable stability, the figures being
2003, 2376. 2146, 2101 and 2249. Although twice
as many votes were cast in 1897 as i
In 1877, the increase in the Democratic j
vote is but 249.
Between the death of Patrick Donovan
In this city, the death of Timothy Hurley
at election time in this city, the crime of j
Rosser in San Francisco and the argu
ment of General Barnes, a very interest-
Ing point arises. These four circum- j
stances taken together present a ques- I
tion which can apparently .be an
swered negatively and affirmatively at
the same time. Hurley and another fel- I
low got drunk and during the ensuing
. melee Hurley was hurt and later died.
Donovan was drinking in a saloon. Two
reputable witness* testified under oath ,
that he was thrown out and struck the f
sidewalk with his head, after which he
was lifted up and banged down again by
two men who came out of the saloon.
Inquests were held, and as the easiest
way of disposing of the question as to
whether any one was responsible or not, ;
a verdict was returned of accidental !
death, thus exonerating the saloon-keep
ers from all responsibility.
When General Barnes made his argu
ment on behalf of Rosser, the Tennessee !
murderer, he contended that the murderer |
was not responsible for what he might do :
when under the influence of bad liquor, j
but that the responsibility rested with
those who supplied him with the excita- I
ble stuff. The jury believed him and ac- j
quitted Rosser. On this side of the bay
the saloon-keeper who had supplied Don- I
ovan with drink was acquitted of re- :
sponsibility. Therefore no one is respon- |
sible for the deaths that occur or mur- ]
ders committed where vile liquor is the
original cause.
It would be interesting to know how
these arguments strike the relatives of
Hilderbrand, ot Donovan and of Hurley.
Now that the election of a new Board
of Education is not far away, the time
would seem to be opportune forÂ»a discus
sion of the sensational circular read to
the board some months ago, by Its au
thor, Councilman Cuvellier. In his criti
cism of the method of conducting the
schools Mr. Cuvellier made some startling
statements. Among them were these:
The principal! and teachers tell me that j
they know the work in the grammar grades Is |
nut what it should be, but they gay that the
' work Is laid out for them and they have to j
carry it out. They say frankly that the great ,
trouble is that in the grammar grades there ;
are too many studies forced upon the chil- '
dren, the curriculum is overcrowded, but there ;
Is so much work laid out for each grade, for '
each term, and the class must be dragged |
over It somehow â anyhow. For those pupils I
who are very bright and can keef> up, so much 1
the better: for those children who are Just
plain, everyday children of average intelligence
and who cannot Keep up the rapid pace set for
the class, well, jy much the worse for them;
they have to drop behind and perhaps fall out |
of the ranks. It is a case of the survival of |
the fittest, and your honorable board Is apply
ing this inexorable law of nature with absolute j
heartless cruelty to the children of the Oak
land public schools, where least of all it should
be applied.
.;â¢â¢ â¢ r
Excepting among: the faculty of the High
School I find that in all quarters, among par
ents, children anil teachers alike there is a i
â widespread and general feeling of dissatisfac- !
tion with the manner in which our Oakland i
public schools are conducted, and among the
, parent* this feeling of dissatisfaction has al
most reached the point of indignation.
There is a great deal of truth in Mr. ,
Cuvelller's argument, as nearly every !
parent knows, and candidates for School
Directorships should be prepared to say i
how they stand on such an Important
question.
Mr. Cuvellier's remarks regarding Su
perintendent McClymonds are not new,
although, perhaps, they had never been
printed till he issued his circular. He
says:
"When I ask the principals and teachers In j
our public schools â knowing, as they do, i
that the course of study In the grammar grades i
is too much for the average pupil â why they |
do not go frankly to the city superintendent of
schools and to the Board of .Education and
! give you the benefit of their experience, they
answer me that they do not dare to argue
with Mr. McClymonds, and that they know bet
ter than to go to the Board of School Directors
â with any criticisms of the course of study as
laid out by you. Gentlemen, this condition of
Intimidation Ik worthy of Russia, but it is not I
creditable to the city of Oakland In these free
United States, yet where that sentiment Is so
general, I fear there must be some grounds
for it.
Among the members of your honorable board
"I find a disposition on your part to lay the
blame on the shoulders of Mr. McClymonds
and to shift your share of responsibility onto j
him. Several of you have admitted to me
that you know that the public schools of Oak- i
land are in some respects lacking In efficiency, j
l hat many children are being driven out of I
school from discouragement and because they
cannot keep up under the strain, but you ex
cuse yourselves from making a fight to remedy
this by saying that Mr. McClymonds Is a. I
â¢â¢bulldozer"; that he will not listen to reason |
nor argument; that you are in the minority i
and that he has the entire board hypnotized- :
that you do not dare oppose him In any of his
Ideas and that you Just have to sit quietly I
and let him have his own way in everything
although you are at times convinced that his
â way Is not always the best way. This lack
of moral courage on your part, gentlemen, does
not do you credit. I do not believe that Mr.
McClymonds Is quite as bad as you would
make him out.
Without saying that Mr. Cuvellier is
right or that Mr. McClymonds is the
Board of Education, it can be said with
truth that there is some apparent foun
dation for the criticism. It is certainly
Incumbent on the School Board that will
be elected In March to establish the
truth or error of Mr. Cuvcliier's scathing
criticism. Mr. McCiymonds may not- be
a bulldozer or a hypnotist, but that he is
not a stranger to the role of dictator is a
fact.
The Oakland Gas Company is either
very different from the anarchistic idea
of a corporation or else Its general man
ager, John A. Britton, is in need of a
guardian. The Board of Health desires
the City Council to provide for the ap
pointment of a chemist and bacteriologist.
John A. Britton appeared before the com
mittee to urge upon the Council the im
portance of the passage of an ordinance
â .providing for such officers. He said that
lie had been impressed with the import
ance of an ordinance providing for such
officers. He said that he had been im
pressed with the importance of this bacter
iological work by the exhibit made at the
recent State Exposition held in Oakland.
The Council is charged with the care of
the health of the city. Mr. Britton said
that the amount asked, $450 for six
months, was slight. He was also im
' pressed with tfie importance of this meas
i ure that, with the company which he rep
resented, the Oakland Gas Light and
Heat Company, he would consent that
should the condition of city funds not
permit the necessary expenditure, that
this amount might be transferred from
the street lighting fund and they would
receive so. much: less on this year's con
tract.
No petition for a guardian has yot been
filed. STUART W. BOOTH.
DEATH OF CAPT. BATCHELDER.
Passing Away of a WelL-Knpwn Man
Of Oakland.
OAKLAND, Jan. I.â D. F. Batchelder,
who for twelve years was a popular spe
cial policeman on the Broadway beat, be
tween Ninth and Fourteenth streets, died
very suddenly at his home, 811 Isabella
street, this morning, of valvular disease
of the heart. He was a native of Bos
ton, aged 76 years. His wife died three
years ago.
The death of "Captain" Batchelder, as
he was familiarly known, recalls a suit
of no small proportions dismissed in the
United States District Court some time
ago. It involved the title to 160 acres of
land known as Bakers Beach, near Point
Lobos, San Francisco.
Captain Batchelder married Mrs. Maria
â Baker, widow of the late John Henry
Baker, in the early '70s, and shortly
tiftrward the property referred to, and
left by J. H. Baker to his widow, was
mortgaged by the newly-acquired hus
band. Captain Batchelder, for $36,000. The
mortgage was held by the late John
Breckmystel of San Francisco, who, it
was afterward claimed, had foreclosed on
it very suddenly one day and subsequent
ly brought the property in for $60,000.
This occurred in 1K79. and in about June
of that year Batchelder commenced suit
l'>r its recovery and the case has ever
since hung fire in various courts, until re
cently, when it was thrown out- of the
I'nited States District Court on the |
ground of lack of jurisdiction.
Deceased leaves only a stepson, J. H. I
Baker, who is also an officer, and who ]
stated to-night that his stepfather's death j
would by no means terminate the effort
to regain possession of Bakers Beach.
The date of the funeral has not been
determined, but the body, will probably be
Interred in the family plot in Odd Fellows' j
Cemetery. San Francisco. "
New Year in Oakland Churches.
OAKLAND, Jan. 1. â Services appropri
ate to the advont of the new year were
held at many of the local churches to
day. At St. Paul's Episcopal Church the
excellent music rendered at the Christ
mas services was repeated, and the pro
gramme is pronounced by critics to be as
tine as was ever heard in an Episcopal
church on this coast.
Rev. Charles A. Brown, pastor of the
first Congregational Church, delivered an
interesting sermon entitled, 'A Message
for the New Year."
"Taking Account of Stock" -was the sub
ject of Rev. Dr. Dille's sermon to-night
at the First M. E. Church. During the
services Professor and Mrs. Dobbins sang
several selections.
At the First- Presbyterian Church Rev.
Dr. Coyle preached New Year sermons at
both services to-day.
Rev. Philip Graif to-night preached his |
\:<*i Sunday sermon at the First Free
Baptist Church, before going to Maine in |
answer to a call from the Lewiston Col- j
lege church.
At St. Andrew's Episcopal Church to- j
night the children held their Christmas j
carol service and Rev. James Hulme, rec- I
tor. preached a brief sermon.
Rev. J. N. Goss of San Francisco '
preached the morning sermon at Rev. V. ,
Marshall Law's Church of the Advent, '
and the services to-night were entirely
musical in the way of the '"Festival of !
the Levites." Mrs. Blake-Alverson took
a prominent part again.
"The Beginning" was the subject of
Rev. J. R. Knowdell's sermon at the Pil
grim Congregational Church this morn
ing.
At the First Baptist Church to-night
there was special music by the choir and
Rev. C. H. Hobart, the pastor, delivered !
a sermon on "The Conquest of Time. '
This morning he spoke on "The Outlook
for the Last Year of the Century."
Rev. J. T. Sunderland delivered "A Ser
mon 'for the New Year," at the First
Unitarian Church.
Rev. 11. W. Fraser -of Minneapolis, who
returns home to-morrow, conducted the
services to-day at the Brooklyn Presby
terian Church.
"The Bible, the Best Guide for the New
Year." was the subject of Rev. C. M.
Hill's sermon at the Tenth-avenue Bap
tist Church to-nipht.
City Hall Afire.
OAKLAND, Jan. I.â The City Hall nar
rowly escaped destruction by fire again j
this "morning, as the "old shack" usually
does on the slightest provocation. Sparks ;
from a defective flue ignited the wood- ;
work just beneath the roof at the south
east corner of the building, and several
feet of shingles were burned away before I
an alarm summoned the Fire Department, j
The blaze occurred shortly before 8i
o'clock, when the streets were almost de
serted and was discovered by two lads
who notified Day Jailer Charles Ham
merton in the City Prison. He turned in
the alarm.
Alameda's Greeting to the New Year.
ALAMEDA, Jan. I.â Alameda has never
greeted a new year with a? much zest,
heartiness and noise as it did 1899. There
has been a particularly hopeful feeling in
business circles and merchants have free
ly expressed confidence that the new year
is going to bring them better times and
better trade. All the city seemed to be
possessed of the same fueling last night.
Old men and young, business men and re
tired citizens were imbued with the same â 
spiTit and turned out early in the even- i
ing with fishhorns. drums and every con
ceivable instrument capable of producing
noise Squads paraded the street from
sunset last night until dawn this morning
and made more noise than Alameda ever
heard before.
At midnight and for an hour after the
advent of the new year one could hardly
"bear himself think" above the din. The
ftrebella rung, bombs were exploded, whis
tles blew and above all was the tooting of
horns and the beating of drums. Ihe
crowds of celebraters were good-natured
and well behaved and not a single arrest
was recorded by the police.
Improved Fire-Fighting Facilities.
ALAMEDA. Jan : Lâ The efficiency of
the local Fire Department was improved
yesterday by placing in commission a new
hose wagon at the Sherman-street fire
house. Bruno Steinmetz. driver of Chemi
cal Engine No. 1, was placed in ch arge of
the new apparatus. Jonn Finley extra

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 2, 1899.
HEW PATRONS
AT THE COUNTY
PIE-COUNTER
Assume Their Duties
To-Day.
ONE SOLITARY FUSIONIST
REPUBLICANS TO FILL EVERY
OTHER OFFICE.
Cash, Records and Murderers Will
Pass Into the Hands of Men
Well Fitted for Their
Trusts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. L
A small host of officials and deputies are
earning their last day's salary in the em
ploy of the county to-day. To-morrow at
noon the luckier ones will enter upon four
years of easy work and large pay. And
many who worked hard under promises
of deputyships are now bemoaning that
they placed any faith in a political prom
ise.
Tax Collector Barber, Assessor Dalton,
County Clerk Jordan and Surveyor Nus
baumer will each shake hands with him
self, -wish himself a happy new year, in
duct himself into office and go ahead for
another four years as though nothing
had happened last November.
Sheriff White will turn over his prison
ers and his keys to Sheriff Oscar Rogers
and will go out of office a richer Populist
than when he went in. Calvin B. White
has conducted a clean Sheriff's office.
Auditor Whidden will give place to Cal
Ewing, who has been for four years
chief deputy in the Clerk's office, and who
is a very popular young Republican. If
Cal handles the Auditor's office as he
handles a baseball team it will be useless
FIREMEN' FIGHTING THE FIRST BIG BLAZE OF '99.
for any one to run against him in 1902.
John'j. Allen, one of the most agreeable
Republicans in the county, will succeed
District Attorney Snook. The new Dis
trict Attorney starts out with nearly half
a dozen murderers on his hands, whose
cases are attracting more than local at-
Coroner Baldwin will turn over his rec
ords to Dr. Mohrmann, who will look
after the county's unfortunates during
the next four years. The practical part
of this administration will still be con
tinued at Albprt Brown's morgue.
S O. Crawford is the only Democrat
who will enter upon a good thing to
morrow. He will succeed J. P. Garlick
ns Superintendent of Schools. If Mr.
Crawford be as much of a success as an
official as he has been as principal of a
public school his errors of political faith
will be forgiven. , , , ..
Recorder Spear will give way to the
carmen's friend, A. K. Grim, and the lat
ter will have for his chief deputy R. S.
Leskie who was once Assessor. Recorder
Grim proved his popularity by his big
majority, and although nominated outside
his party he is of the Republican fold.
â¢Arthur Feidler of Livermore will receive
all the county's cash on hand from Treas
urer Sanford and will cash the warrants
of the faithful for four years. He will
handle about two millions a year, which
is probably more than Arthur Feidler fin
gered in a livery stable business in Mur
ray Township.
Public Administrator Knight will yield
the care of the estates of widows and
orphans and absent heirs to B. C. Hawes
of San Leandro. who is perhaps as well
fitted to be honored with the sacred trust
as any one In the county.
The" Supervisors will meet Tuesday and
reorganize. Messrs. Church and Talcott
will succeed themselves, and an hour later
perhaps the anxiety regarding the hos
pital and jail physicians will be termin
ated.
With the single exception of County
School Superintendent Crawford, every
department of the county government for
the next four years will be strictly Re
publican. Three of the retiring officials
were Populists.
POLITICAL ROW OPENS
WITH THE NEW YEAR
ALAMEDA OFFICE-SEEKERS GET
TING DOWN TO BUSINESS.
Calculating en What Figure the Mu
nicipal League May Cut at
the City Election.
AI.AMEDA, Jan. I.â With the opening
of the new year political forces -will be
marshaled and political lines drawn for
the municipal campaign which will ter
.minate at the election In April. The fight
will be as long as Alameda has ever ex
perienced, and promises to be as bitter
as any that has preceded It. The Mu
nicipal League has taken the Initiative
and has called a convention of Its mem
bers to be held this month to nominate
a complete city ticket.
The league 1b a problem that the poli
ticians have not been able to solve. It is
the outgrowth of the old Good Govern
ment Club that had a skyrocket career.
While the office-seekers freely express
the opinion that It will not cut much fig- i
ure at the election, many of them are
pulling strings to secure the league's in
dorsement. The leading spirits in it are
men -who in the days that have passed
controlled the political situation in Ala
meda, but who have lost their grip by
the advent of a younger and livelier ele
ment in municinal affairs.
There has been some talk of drawing
party lines in the coming campaign, but
the voters are decidedly against such a
plan. Alameda has always leaned toward
the non-partisan idea. The political field
has been free for all, and the voters have
seldom made a rriistake in picking the
best man.
The most active fights will be madÂ© for
the offices of City Assessor, Treasurer
and Marshal. Arthur G. Burns is out for
the Assessorship against E. Minor Smith,
the incumbent. Burns has thÂ« support
of the younger element and his friends
are making a lively canvass for him. Mr.
Smith has held the office for several
terms and says he will put up the fight
of his life to succeed himself.
Roswell G. Wheeler (incumbent). Elmer
Johnston, Oswald Lubbock and Linwood
Palmer want to fill the office of City
Treasurer. Mr. Wheeler seems to have
the inside track just now, with the field
somewhat demoralized from lack of or
ganization.
There will be no scarcity of candidates
for City Marshal. If John Conrad, who
was appointed to the position to fill thÂ©
unexpired term of Oscar Rogers, decides
to be a candidate it is generally conceded
that he will have little opposition. But
Mr. Conrad has not made up his mind
that he wants the office, and in the mean
time a host of men who yearn to shine
as the head of the local police department
are pulling their friends in line and pre
paring for the fray. On the list are
Louis Schroeder, who was assistant jailer
under Sheriff McKillican: William Gunn,
an officer on the local police force; ex-
Constable Charles Day, Harry Trausue,
George McÃea and Ralph Hamlin.
City Recorder St. Sure and City Clerk
Lamborn will be In the field to succeed
themselves. As yet they have no oppo
sition, and it is not believed there will be

CAN CONSUMPTION BE
CURED BY ELECTRICITY?
Â« , 0
Â£ Â«
$ nâ¢*HE new discovery in electricitty and electro therapeutics which has 0
w I been made by a medical man" in the East and which was published ex- 0
Â£ I clusively by The Call in Saturday's paper, has made a decided eommo- 0
O tinn among the medical profession in this city. The doctor who made 0
0 the discovery claims that he can cure any person afflicted with consump- 0
0 tion by placing the patient in a glass case and then turning on a current 0
0 of one million volts of electricity. Ater several applications the doctor 0
0 claims he can utterly destroy the bacilli of tuberculosis and heal the lungs 0
Jo> of the diseased patient. The inventor has refused to divulge his name 0
0 and -has placed the plans of his discovery in the hands of a prominent 0
0 lawyer, who is at present in Washington endeavoring to secure patent 0
0 rights on the new method of treatment of consumptives. b
0 Yesterday a Call reporter interviewed a number of physicians* in this 0
0 city on the subject of the new treatment, with the following results: 0
0 Dr. Wlnslow Andersonâ has for a long time been of great 0
0 value to the medical profession. It is used every day in three various 0
0 forms. Firstly, we use one kind of electricity to relieve pain, we use an- 0
0 other kind In the treatment of paralyzed muscles or limbs and also to 0
0 increase the blood supply, and thirdly electricity for cauterizing sores, ul- 0
0 cers and Inflamed throats. , These are the three main uses of electricity 0
0 In the medical profession. I am a little skeptical about treating a man af- 0
0 flicted with the bacilli of tuberculosis externally with electric current. 0
0 Half of the electric medical discoveries have proved valueless, but never- 0
0 theless electricity has its therapeutic value. ' ti
0 Dr. Mark H. . Woolseyâ Ther idea of curing consumption by any single 0
0 therapeutic agent Is absurd. It has been proven so. In the treatment 0
0 for consumption the bacilli of tuberculosis is not the only condition to *">
0 face. Many a person dies of â  consumption and the bacilli of tuberculosis 0
0 has not been discovered. When tuberculosis Is discovered in a patient, 0
0 In a great majority of cases, the disease is quite well advanced, and the ; 0
0 different organs and tissues of the body have undergone such changes of 0
0 degeneration and destruction as to place them beyond the reach of not 0
0 only one but all the therapeutic agents. Â«
0 :; Dr. "W. H. Maysâ l cannot see how the electric power wouia kill germs 0
0 and yet not kill the patient. I doubt very much if the tuberculosis would 0
0 be at all Injured. Yet, again, for a doctor to attempt to get a patent is 0
0 very, unprofessional. No doctor in good standing has ever patented his 0
0 discoveries. It Is an unwritten law to do all you can to benefit mankind. 0
0 Dr. Henry J. Gibbons Jr.â AH I have to say about this new cure is I 0
0 want to see it demonstrated before I express any decided opinion. There 0
0 is no new remedy so fanciful that it is not able to gather a following-. 0
0 There is one way of curing consumption, and that is by invigorating the 0
0 system of the patient so that the vital forces can resist the disease ,or 0
0 germs. "There is also no doubt that electricity is a great nerve tonic. Pos- 0
0 slbly the new cure may be successful in this way, but I would not i.Ke 0
oto express any further opinion until I see the treatment demonstrated. 0
0 ; Dr. W. F. Cheneyâ l would be very much disinclined to believe in the 0
0 new cure, for this reason: "While we know definitely the effect produced 0
0 on germs by electricity and other powerful agents when the germs are 0
0 outside of the body, we know absolutely nothing, of how these agents act 0
0 upon germs protected .within the body. The vita\ question is whether 0
0 the living cells that make up the tissues would not be more Injured by the 0
0 plan proposed than the tuberculosis.' . 0
0 Dr. C. G. Kenyonâ So much mystery is back of electricity that It is 0
0 hard to come to a conclusion. Electricity of the electro-static current is 0
0 the strongest, and glass is the best non-conductor. Now how much 'of 0
0 this current the patient would receive Is a question. I am a strong be- 0
0 liever in electricity in medical/ assistance, but I am somewhat doubtful 0
0 of this new cure. â  0

OIL SOAKED
IT BURNED
LIKE TINDER
Krogh Manufacturing
Plant Destroyed.
A STEVENSON-STREET BLAZE
THREATENED TO BECOME A
GENERAL CONFLAGRATION.
Building and Contents a Total Loss.
Adjoining Establishments Bad
ly Damaged by Fire
and Water.
Fire broke out last evening In the three
story brick building on Stevenson street.
. near First, owned by the Pacific Light
I and Power Company and occupied by the
I Krogh Manufacturing Company. In less
than an hour the building and its con
tents were totally destroyed. The San
Francisco Tool Company, California Ar
tistic Metal Works and the American Car
bonic Acid Company also had their
plants in the building. All their valuable
machinery and stock went up in smoke.
The fire was discovered by Maurice
Duane, one of Morse's patrolmen, who
was standing at the corner of Stevenson
' and First. He ran to First and Mission
streets and turned in an alarm from box
! .".4. Chief Sullivan and his department
were quick to respond and soon many
; powerful streams were being played into
the burning structure from all sides
1 The huge beams, rafters and floors of
the building were literally soaked with
grease, oil and other combustibles used in
manufacturing and the interior of the
structure curled and crackled ns each
fork of flre licked its way to the roof
A fresh south wind was blowing and It
looked for a while as if the flames would
spread to adjoining buildings A second
alarm was turned In and with reinforce
ments Chief Sullivan prevented a general
conflagration.
The Fire Department's new water tower
was wheeled into Stevenson street and
from a position directly .in front of the
blazing building it threw tons and ton=
of water into the seething mass of flames.
On the top of the building there was a
large windlass sef on beams projecting
four or five feet from the roof. This took
fire and threatened every minute to top
ple over on the heads of the firemen in
the narrow alley below. In addition to
this the Fire Department was pertly
harassed by the numberless electric light
and power'wires struncr overhead.
In the rear portion of the building the
California Paint Works had gallons and
gallons of turpentine stored, and if tho
wind had been blowing from the north,
there would have been quite an explosion,
attended probably by loss of life.
The fire burned for several hours.
â¢'lt is rather difficult to say just how
the blaze started." said Fire Marshal
Towe. "There had been nobody in the
building for twenty-four hours and the
only explanation I can offer is tnat n
was caused by spontaneous combustion.
Captain Comstock estimated th* loss at
$15,(K)0, although it may reach at least
$20,000. The printing plant of Brown &
Bley, on the third floor of the adjoining
building, was badly damaged by smoke
and water. A substantial firewall saved
it from being damaged or perhaps de
stroyed. _______

PLOT TO PURCHASE
A NATIONAL HONOR
Dan Burns Is Using the Police Department of
This City With Which to Bait
Officers of State.
Paniel M. Burns Is playing a gambler's |
gam* l to win the prize of a seat in the
Vn.tfd States Senate. In his striped ca
reer as a malefactor in and out of prison
cells, he has staked his personal honor
and the lives and liberty of his closest |
and dearest friends against success. !
Sometimes he won with the instruments !
of his dishonest greed and sometimes he
lost. From the moment that he crawied, |
Bcakelike, into a position of public trust
until now the shadow of his personality I
has been a death blight to those upon ;
whom It has fallen.
]n public lifp ho has been suspected, dis
credited and dishonored. In private life I
ho has been shunned, feared and despised.
Hla public associates have been blacklegs :
and his private friends his victims. Hay- ;
ing dishonored himself, condemned by
association his friends, and robbed his
benefactor, be bus planned how to bring
distress to many homes and with a bait ;
of gre<=d, grasp a new element of success;
in his desperate tight for the Senatorship.
Daniel Bl Burns has decided to rob '
twenty-one members of the local Police
Department of their livelihood by taking
from them the:- positions. The agree
ment has been made, the list of victims
has noen drawn, and if the fear of public \
Indignation does not prevent the success j
of the conspiracy, twenty-one members of

the Police Department must give up to I
T)an Hums the means by which the> n\e.
This compact of a knave, a blackleg and
a senile Chief of Police was made nearly |
a EaÂ°c n h th of a uÂ°e parties to the jcheme has
mxm
as a person closely connected to one of
?he Commissioners may attest Places
demanded the terrible sacrltice of
. s olt is a party to the plot ge
ne owes hlfl present political life
and the hope of its continuance to Dan
Burns Gunst, as Police Commissioner,
many interests to protect. They are
Hot the interests that are good for the
city, but they are the interests of Gunst
and his friends, of gamblers and black
fees Gunst therefore did not weigh long
the balance between his interests and
those of twenty-one men and their H\ing.
Some of these men are ill from the effects
of ?he?r service to the city. They have,
completely dependent upon them, fami
lies without other means of support.
More than one of them has been a hero in
the performance of his duty. But
Gunst gambler's friend and associate,
creature and tool of Burns, counts these
considerations for nothing. He has
promised to make twenty-one vacancies
in the Police Department that Burns may
offer bait to twenty-one members of the
State Legislature and Gunst may protect
the immoral agencies of the town.
Chief of Police Lees is party to the
scheme because he is lustful for the con
tinual possession of power. When Gunst
sought to take from the old man this
power Lees, in fretful fuming and the
fury of old age, rebelled. Now that there
is- for him the greedy hope that he will
not. be molested in his sham of greatness
he agrees heartily to the demand of the
conspirators. He. cares nothing for the
efficiency of the Police Department nor
for The existence of its members. Some
of the men that have been selected for
retirement are among the most efficient in
the service* Others are ill and friendless
and others without power. It is easy for
Dan Burns, Mose Gunst and Chief Lees
to destroy such men.
The scheme was readily formed. .^ c "
has made the Palace Hotel his head
quarters for a month.-. When he should
have been, in the performance of his duty,
at the City Hall be was at the Palace
Hotel in consultation with Dan Burns
The Chief ot Police was willing 0 obey
Burns and- eager to propitiate Gunst. It
waâ¢thought feasible at first to increase
â¦Hp police force by twenty-five, members,
hut this would require an appropriation
from the Board of Supervisors, and the
Plan was abandoned. It was then decided
to create as many vacancies as possible
Vacancies have been made in the Police
Deprtment before for the benefit of State
legislators by manufacturing charges
against unprotected patrolmen and dis
missing them from the service. Such a
plan was no " sooner discussed than
abandoned, as thÂ« administration of Lees
Is offensive enough without the confession
of the old man himself. Charges of cor
ruption would be an admission of guilt,
and the scheme was dismissed with very
little discussion.
Bums then determined that those mem
bers of the department who are eligible
for retirement under the pension law and
those that have met misfortune and are
ill should be retired. Burns' demand was
at one" accepted. Chief Clerk Wright of
the Police Department was at once in
structed to prepare a list of those that.
by the provisions of the scheme, could
hi retired from the department and their
Places filled by the selections of State leg
islators Clerk Wright was not slow in
obeying. The pension law provides that
all members of the department that have
had a continuous service of twenty year*
and have reached the age of 60 years may
be retired on a pension of half. pay.
Retirement is not compulsory, but is
at the discretion of the Police Commis
sion sitting as a Board of Police Pen
sion Commissioners. It would be absurd
to retire efficient officers simply because
they had reached a certain age. Such
action has never been taken honestly. It
Is only in â¢'"' emergency, such as Burns
has presented, that the Police Commis
sioners, compliant or worse, lend them
pelves to a scheme that works mischief
to the service and grave injustice to un
protected officers. _Â... Â t .
When Wright had finished his list and
discovered all of the men In the depart
ment who were either ill or more than
60 years of age copies of the list were
pent to the different captains in whose di
visions are the men who are to be re
tired Through these sources the victims
learned of their coming fate. They knew
that their time is short, as the Police
Commissioners will meet to-morrow
morning as Pension Commissioners unless
the illness of Commisisoner Tobin pre
vents. Mr. Tobln has been seriously but
not dangerously ill, and if he cannot at
tend to-morrow the other Commissioners
will meet and adjourn until he is able
to do so. The unfortunate officers will
then have a little more time in which to
fight for their lives.
Chief Lees is quite confident, however,
that Tobin will be able to attend. The
Chief held yesterday afternoon, therefore,
his last preliminary conference with
Wright. The talk lasted for several
hours. The list of men selected for dis
missal is as follows:
Captains Hohen and Dunlevy; Detectives
Bainbridge and Silvey; Sergeants Llnd
heimer and Brown, City Prison; Sergeant
Shields. North End station; Sergeant
Barnstead. Southern station; Sergeant
Avan, Harbor station; Corporals John
Burke. California-street station; Heaney
and-Hagarty. Seventeenth-street station:
Patrolmen Pugan. attached to the School
Department; Peter Coleman and Libby,
Southern station; John McGreevy and
Charles O'Malley. Harbor station; Gag
nor, Morehouse, Fred Smith and Barney
Harter, Central station.
It will be seen that this list includes
two captains, two detectives, five ser
geants, three corporals and nine patrol
menâ twenty-one in all. Some of the men
who are to be retired are among the most
efficient and widely experienced in the de
partment. Some of them are so thoroughly
informed on the affairs of the department
and its necessities that they cannot be re
placed. To dismiss such men means sim
ply to serve a dishonest purpose and obey
a dangerous demand.
Through the influence of superior offi-
cers a few of the men on the list of de
capitation were Informed of their ap
proaching misfortune. With a dpspera
tion inspired by the knowledge that they
are to lose their livelihood these men have
since been vigorously seeking influence to
save their positions. Among those that
;irc fighting practically for their existence
are' Corporal Heaney, Sergeants Brown
and L,indhelmer and Captain Dunlevy,
all of these men are of acknowledged
ability and value in their respective
spheres, but they are to be sacrificed to
the ambition of Dan Burns.
With the vacancies created by the dis
missal of these men Dan Burns hopes to
be able to buy votes.
A legislator who has the power to ap
point a captain of police of San Francisco

KEYBOARD WIZARD
T^e Virtuoso Bows to Society To-Â«Moppow
Evening.
MORIZ ROSENTHAL, the ceiehrat
ed virtuoso of the piano, arrived
at the Palace yesterday from I.os
Angeles. To-morrow evening he will
be heard at the Metropolitan Temple
in a recital embracing four numbers.
Society at large and the music-loving
public of San Francisco in particular
havp heard much of Rosenthal. His
triumph of ton years ago in this coun
try is still remembered, as is the dis
appointment that was experienced two
years ago when he was BUduenly taken
ill and was unable to fulfill his con
tract to tour this country. His ap
pearance here to-mnrrow evening is
pimply the realization of a deferred
pleasure.
Rosenthal possesses a personality
as a man that is no less attractive than his art L,ow of stature but with
a build that suggests much latent physical strength, he at the same time ha."
a softness of charm and manner that makes delightful the time spent in his
company. He converses with a rare degree of intelligence and a fascinating
accent. B
Rosenthal is an artist. He is a musician because he cannot be anything
else. Imbued with the most refined senslbllites of harmony, he has brought the
controlling passion of his life to a masterly degree of perfection by years of
ceaseless study. Two years ago he was here convalescing from his illness but
to-morrow evening marks his first bow to a San Francisco audience as a pianist
Rosenthal never sacrifices technique for interpretation. At the same time he
does not lack life or fire, and with his wonderful digital ability he is truly the
master of any composition that he may set before him. In respect to inter
pretation he is the opposite of the vitriolic Joseffy. for there is never the slightest
suggestion of effort in Rosenthal's manipulation of the keys.
The first number on to-morrow's programme is Beethoven's "Sonataâ Op 109 "
The three movements of this masterpiece will give Rosenthal's audience a chance
to Judge of his soul, expression and interpretation, while the very next number"
Schumann's "Carnival," will eerve to Illustrate his dexterity and the znasterlÂ£
Ecopo and wonderful reserve foreÂ© of bis execution.

ranged his bait to suit, his pame. Big fish
need large bait and small fish are tempted
by little hooks and Burns knows that
there are big and little fish In the State
Legislature.
Craftily, therefore. Burns has arranged
to give to each member whom he needs
from the interior the right to appoint one
patrolman of . the police force of San
Francisco. The higher positions are to be
given to the legislative del*gation from
this city.
, This in outline is the plot that is so
cruel to officers that must live by their
labors and so injurious to a department
that is saturated more than enough al
ready with the drippings of corruption
The Call does not pretend to predict that
the plot will be carried to completion. If
the Police Commissioners obey the de
mand of Burns they will have precedent
for their action. If they do not another
public expose will have prevented another
public outrage.

PREYING UPON
THE COMMUNITY
How the Telephone Company Per
fected Its Gigantic Bureau
of Eavesdropping.
THE expose of the dishonorable meth
ods employed by the Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph Company
toward Its patrons and the public has
excited general dismay, disgust and in
dignation. Were it not for the absolute
| proof presented by The Call It would seem
I that this company would not dare violate
j the confidence reposed .in its honesty as
far as to become a public menace instead
of what It is paid to beâ a public benefit.
But men may be bribed to commit the
most despicable offenses, one of which
the Pacific Telephone Company has raised
to the despicable dignity of a corporate
existence. This company has made itself
a gigantic bureau of eavesdroping, organ
ized and protected under the law, to
listen at every man's door.
So thoroughly is this shameful fact
known that employes of the corporation
from the highest to the lowest are aware
that in every telephone office there Is a
"listening table," where the eavesdropper
may sit and hear any conversation that
is carried on over any wire operated by
the company in any part of the city,
State or coast. The "listening table" is
the keyhole of the telephone company
and it is operated by the eavesdroppers of
I the company, even without the knowledge
of the ordinary employes.
Only the most trusted servants of the
concern are allowed to manipulate it.
The dishonorable possibilities of such a
system cannot be exaggerated. Affairs
from the most trivial to the most import
ant are known to these legalized eaves
droppers. Information that they are
bribed, as The Call has shown, to give
or that they may use for blackmail, is at
I their command. Facts that the exigen
: cies of public or private business demand
should be kept secret are in the posses
sion of this company.
The substance of every message that is
sent or received over the Sunset system
is reduced to writing, indexed and filed
away. Why this should be done it is
easy to understand. Men are not knaves
| for pleasure. When they are rascals they
! are paid for being such. The Call deems
j it a duty therefore to warn the public of
i the manner of men who are managing the
Pacific Telephone Company, and while
they are being overpaid to render an hon
est public service they are stealing for
' dishonest gain the secrets of the city anl
State.
Particularly should a warning be given
to those patrons of the Pacific Telephone
Company who bolleve they are paying
for what is known as a "private tele
A CAUCUS OF
THE NEW BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS
Appointments to City
Jobs Considered.
POLICE COURT CHANGES
JUDGES LOW AND JOACHIMSEN
AS PROSECUTORS.
L. Q. Carpenter and George Went
â worth Also Selectedâ Recorder Ber
thier Completes His List of
Deputies and Copyists.
The. incoming Board of Supervisors held
a caucus on appointments last evening in
Dr. Perrault's office. The list of fortu
nate ones who are to receive positions
under the new administration was prac
tically completed, but the names are not
to beannounced until to-night, as several
changes are possible. The positions in
the four Police Courts are all decided.
Police Judges Charles A. Low and H. L.
Joachimsen are to be prosecuting at
torneys. This is one of the peculiar re
sults in tho game of politics. Thomas
Graham, Prosecuting Attorney in Judge
Joachimsen's court, will ascend the
bench, and the ex-judge will take his
place as prosecutor.
X* G. Carpenter, the well-known news
paper man, who is a graduate of the Ann
Arbor (Mich.) Law School, and Attorney
George A Wentworth will prosecute
criminals in the other two departments.
Jack P. Rice, James W. McQuaide, F.
Kelly and Fred Con way are to be clerks
of the Police Courts.
One of the important changes made by
the new hoard was the appointment of
W. I. Thompson, as superintendent of
construction of the new Hall of Justice.
Recorder Bertheir will take charge of
his office at 2 p. m. to-day, when his as
sistants are to meet at the Recorder's
office for instructions. Last night the ap
pointments in this office were completed.
They are as follows:
Chief deputy. Charles E. Corey: depu
ties, Harry Baehr and Max Warshaner;
marriage 'license clerk, Joseph Tlttel;
mortgage clerk. Edward W. Eustlce;
messenger, John Patten; chief copy
ist, John E. Durnier; copyists, John Cal
ish, Charles Malpiede, Eli Landry Wil
lam Fritz, A. T. Green, Joseph Hayea.
Fred Franks, Joseph Maguire, Jerry
Moore, W. L. Dauterman Jr., Sam Hamil
ton, Percy Levy, Ed Duffield. E. B. Car
roll, Frank Koegel, Edward Haugkey.
Joe Mogan, for several years steward
at the Recr-iving Hospital, has been ap
pointed clerk in the Coroner's office by
Dr. Hill.
Proud of the Record.
Captain Spillane feels proud of the rec
ord made by the patrol wagon of the
Southern Station during the month of De
cember. He has prepared a tabulated
statement of the number of "runs." It is
now in the hands of Chief Lees.
The document shows that there were
580 "runs" during that period, the largest
for the same length of time in the history
of the department.
There were 648 prisoners conveyed in the
wagon to the City Prison and 6S injured
people taken to the Receiving Hospital.
The number of miles traversed by the
wagon was nearly 1100.
Meeting of the Pavers' Union.
The monthly meeting of the Pavers'
Union, held yesterday at Hibernia Hall,
â was a success, being well attended by
representatives from all over the city.
As Indicated by the reports read before
the assembled members, the union is in
a flourishing condition, which bids well
to continue during the entire new year.
EX-SENATOR DUBOIS TO WED.
South Dakota Miss Will Become the
Idaho Statesman's Bride.
CHICAGO, Jan. I.â Cards are out to-day
announcing the marriage of ex-United
States Senator Fred Dubois of Blackfoot,
Idaho, and Miss Edna Maxfleld Waited of
phone" In their place of business or in
their homes. The company agrees, upon
request, not to place the number of a
patron's telephone in the public books.
This is a concession that is asked for
many reasons. Patrons may wish to be
saved from annoyance. They may desire
to discuss only those affairs that are of
the greatest privacy. Whatever their rea
son may be it is their own and the com
pany promises to honor it.
Under the terms of this agreement the
company promises not to give an in
quirer such a patron's number under any
condition. To communicate with such a
patron one must know the number of the
telephone and must receive the informa
tion from any source except the telephone
company. This is the theory. The prac
tice is different.
The managers of the Pacific Telephone
Company affect to be greatly concerned
over the exposure of their offenses. Their
concern is the chagrin of detection, not
the humiliation of guilt. For some peo
ple, "getting caught" is the only offense
in the calendar.
Officers of the Telephone Company have
made lists of these private telephones and
have sold them to whomever offered a
sufficient consideration. In this way they
strike a double bargain. By becoming
what they believe to be a public necessity
they are bribed to give an exacting ser
vice. They are then bribed to sell the
secrets they obtain.
John I. Sabin, president and general
manager of the Pacific Telephone Com
pany, was seen yesterday afternoon by a
Call reporter in regard to the expose of
the lax and corrupt methods in the ope
ration of the company's business. He dis
played evidence of great confusion and
refused to talk on the subject. The as
sistant general manager, Louis Glass, was
more communicative, however, until in
terdicted by his superior officer, Mr. Sa
bin. "I did not know of the story in The
Call until you told me of it," he said,
"and I cannot understand it at all. I know
that such a state of affairs as described
in The Call cannot exist. Whenever we
discover that there is an employe â of
whom we have a large numberâ who is
not strictly secretive as to the communi
cations passing through the office, he or
she is discharged immediately."
Just at this juncture Mr. Glass was
called to his private telephone. When he
returned he said that he was interdicted
fmm speaking further and that Mr.
Sabin would represent the company for
all interviews.
Being asked If it were not possible that
an operator might receive or overhear a
message and then transmit it to some
other than tbe party to whom it was to
be properly sent, he refused to answer.
The ban had been placed upon his tongue
and he declined to be Interviewed
further.
