* American Commissioners to Proceed
With the Distribution of Money

Herald. Copyrighted, 1899. by James Gor- '*
don Bennett. +
HAVANA, May 22.â The cloud ; I
of uncertainty that has been â¦
hanging over Cuban affairs was <f
dissipated to-day as the result of a â¦
long conference between Generals â¢â ?>
Brooke and Gomez, and there is no â¦
reason why the 53.000.000 fund T
should not be distributed and the
arms surrendered unless unexpected 1
opposition develops aniong officers Â±
and soldiers.
General Brooke will issue his order J
to-morrow. It distinctly states that an J
agreement has been reached between X
Generals Brooke and Gomez and the
money will be destributed by the Amer- I *
ican Commissioners previously desig- *f
natedâ Rafferty, Randall and Bisbee. *
The arms are to be turned over to the ;
civil Governors of provinces wherein t
the soldiers reside or to Mayors. The &
only change from the agreement of a â¦
week ago is a clause stating that at 4
such future time as may be designated â¦
the arms are to be placed in the Cuban j JÂ»
arsenals at Havana and Santiago. i
Undoubtedly an understanding has
been reached between Brooke and %
Gomez that Gomez will be responsible
for the arms surrendered.
leral Gomez states that everything
tory. He asked me to deny
the B made in the American
that President McKinley had
written to him refusing to consider his
sition for organizing the t'uban
army of occupation. He has not heard
from President McKinley on the mat
ter, but understands that he is con
sidering it.
It is generally thought here that the
distribution of money and collection of
a ms will now go on without a show of
resistance on the part of the soldiers.
The long delay and repeated hitches
have caused much bitterness among
the chiefs, and some will advise the
men to go home without the money and
with their arms, but it is thought the
number responding will be small. The
greatest cause of dissatisfaction among
the chiefs is that they receive no extra
money.
The American Commissioners began
the work to-day in instructing Gov
ernors and Mayors in the method of re
ceiving and storing arm?.
STRIKES ON A REEF
NEAR OYSTER BAY
Canadian Navigation Company's
Alaskan Steamship Danube
Goes Ashore.
Â»n.iuriiA, a. \j., may zz.â a<Â»ws was
received here this afternoon from Union,
the coaling- point for steamers in the
Alaskan trade, that the steamer Danube,
owned by the Canadian Pacific Naviga
tion Company of this city, is ashore ne*ar
Oyster Bay. The reef on which she came
to grief is about thirty miles north of
Union, and a boat's crew was dispatched
to Union for assistance. The steamer
Maude of the same fleet, which was at
Union loading coal for Victoria, left to
render what assistance she could. No
particulars were given and until the
Maude returns it will not be known how
the accident occurred.
Captain Meyers, master of the Danube,
is one of the oldest and most experienced
skippers in these waters, and as no bad
weather has been reported it is likely that
still another rock on the Alaska run has
beon located through a disaster. The
Danube is said to be hard and fast even
at flood tide, her bow being high in the
air at low water. If the Maude returns
and reports having been unable to pull
the Danube into deep water, the Tees,
which Is loading now to sail north, will
call at the spot, and both she and the
Maude will join in an effort to release the
Danube.

SHIP ADDED
TO THE NAVY
Captured Spanish Cruiser
Reina Mercedes Reaches
Hampton Roads.
THE REINA MERCEDES.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., May 22.â The Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes
arrived in Hampton Roads yesterday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock in tow
of the Merritt Wrecking Company's tug I. J. Merrltt and the Rescue,
and accompanied by the steamer EL T. Morgan. She 1p now at
anchor nearly two miles off Old Point Comfort, where she will be held In
quarantine for five days. Large crowd? went to Old Point Comfort to see
the cruiser and hundreds went out to the vessels in launches. When she
is released from quarantine she will go to Portsmouth Navy Yard for re
pairs.
The Mercedes left Santiago a week ago Saturday. The voyage was
uneventful with the exception of the very quick time made. Her arrival
was heralded by the boom of ennnon m board th 6 monitor AmphUrite, the
training ships Essex and Alliance and the small cruiser Peoria, all nf which
are in the roads.
Aboard th^ Mercedes there are about twenty men of the Merritt wreck
ing crew, but Dr. Pettus would not allow any of these, nor, in fact, anybody
from <ither the tugs or the barge, to land, nor was she boarded by any
one save himself. The Mercedes will come up to the Norfolk Navy Yard
Friday. Arrangements have already been made there to give a rousing
maritime demonstration in her honor.
The Reina Mercedes bore no small part in bringing the strain upon the feel
ings of the people of the United States toward Spain by her insolent treatment of
the American steamer Valencia of the Ward line, in June, 1897.
The Valencia, with the other steamer? of that line, plied between New York,
Nassau, the ports on the south coast of Cuba and Panama. They were all well
known to the several Spanish war vessels that were watching that part of the
Cuban coast to prevent assistance reaching the Insurgents, and their going and
coming were regular almost to the hour of the day at any given place. On the
morning of June 3 the Valencia having made her call at the port of Guantnnamo,
was leaving the harbor and heading west for Santiago de Cuba, her next call,
when she was approached by the Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes, one of the pa
trolling vessels on that beat, and signaled to show her colors. Not complying
* with this very unnecessary demand as promptly as seemed proper to the Spaniard,
he tired a blank shot across her bows, and followed almost immediately with a
round shot, which, thanks to the bad marksmanship which made itself so conspic
uous in nearly the same locality a year later, fell short, though dangerously near
the American steamer's quarter. The Stars and Stripes, which had already been
"bent on." were flung out and the steamer was allowed to proceed on her way.
This incident added greatly to the feeling of Indignation that had been aroused
some time before, when the Allianca. a sister ship of the Valencia and belonging
lv the same line, was fired upon three tirms off Cape Maisl, at the east end of
Cuba', by the Spanish gunboat Conde de Venadlto, which pursued her on the high
seas -for twenty-five miles, and had the American steamer not been the swifter
vessel she would probably have been sunk.
HOPKINS IS
AFTER THE
SPEAKERSHIP
Ppecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 22.â A Washington
\ special to the Herald says: Represen
; tative Hopkins of Illinois is one of the
i candidates for Speaker who believes
[ the contest will be settled long before
j next December. He is conducting a
campaign which he confidently believes
will result hi his own favor before
July 1.
Mr. Hopkins is not content with writ
ing letters to colleagues. He believes
personal interviews are more effective,
and it is his purpose to follow up com
munications with personal calls upon
j members at their homes. He has made
visits to Wisconsii. and Kansas, after
having made sure of the delegation
from his own State, and is now confi
dent that the delegations of these two
States can be placed to his credit.
Representative Hopkins is in Wash
ington just now to catch any stray
Representatives who may be here. He
had a long interview with the President
to-day and will leave soon for work in
other directions.
One of the main arguments Mr. Hop
kins uses in behalf of his candidacy is
that Illinois has become the pivotal
State in politics, and upon holding it
may depend the continuance of the Re
publican party in power.
"At this time," he says, "Illinois is a
I doubtful State. The great city of Chi
cago has a Democratic Mayor, and if
the election occurred at this time no
hod v can safely predict what the result
would be. Under these circumstances
Representatives must feel that they
should take Illinois into consideration
and do whatever they can to
strengthen the party there. The loss of
the State would be a very serious thing,
and any uncertainty there should be
guarded against as far as possible.
"If Illinois were given the Speaker
ship State pride would operate to make
the people stand by the party which
had honored the State, and would, I
believe, take Illinois out of the doubt-
Zui column."

BY MINERS
Lower California's Newly
Discovered Placer Field
Very Rich.
GROWTH OF THE BOOM
Workmen in the Peninsula Mines
Desert and Rush to Santa
Clara Diggings.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, May 22.â Allan G. Fra
ser, a Los Angeles mining man, ar
rived here to-day from the newly dis
covered rlacer fields in the Santa Clara
district. 400 miles south of this city.
He confirmed the reports of the won
derful richness of the diggings and said
miners were flocking to the camp from
all directions. He saw nuggets taken
out worth $500. and nearly all the Mexi
cans possessed either dust or nuggets.
The placers are located about twenty
miles inland from San Pablo Bay, and
the ground thus far opened covers an
area of about twenty square miles. The
territory beyond has not been thor
oughly prospected. Mr. Fraser said:
"I have no desire to connect my name
with a fake story and thereby cause
many people to invest their all possibly
in an effort to reach a mythical field.
I found the placers quite as rich as had
been reported, and I can say that the
Santa Clara placers are in my estima
tion among the richest ever discovered.
There were about 300 Mexicans and In
dians working the placers when I left,
and they were taking out an average of
from $15 to $20 a day.
"Not far from the diggings I met a
party of Mexicans who exhibited con
siderable gold. They had about $25, '
worth and declared that there was
plenty more where that came from. The
nearest water is ten miles away, and It
is only by the crudest methods of dry
washing that the gold is obtained.
Only tho coarse gold is paved in this
Way- The Cammalli mines have been
deserted and hundreds have left the
Santa Rosa copper mines for th<' new
diggings. TKere is also intense excite
ment at Enscnada. When I was in
camp it was necessary to po to Mulege,
a distance of about lfO* milos, to file a
claim, but I heard that a representa
tive was on his way to establish an
office at the camp.
"The diggings are located on govern
ment land, and under the Mexican
laws a man may file on as many acres
as he wishes by paying $10 on each
pertonencia, which is three acres, and
paying taxes. This may prove a s. ri
ous drawback to the district, as ;i
company could come in and file on the
wholp district. The gold, however, is
there in enormous quantities, and may
be had without the privation and suf
ferings that must be contended with in
Alaska.
"The best way to reach the diggings
is from San Pablo Bay. There is a
fairly good trail from there to the
camp, and drinking water may be had
six miles from the coast. This is the
nearest water to the placers."
A letter has been received in this city
from D. Goldbaum of Ensenada con
firming the reports of the rich dis
coveries and the intense excitement
i that prevails on the peninsula. Mr.
FORM OF GOVERNMENT
OFFERED TO TAGALS
EVERY VOLUNTEER
TO LEAVE MANILA
BY LAST OF JULY
General Shafter Ordered to Get
Ready to Receive 4000 Men
at the Presidio.
WASHINGTON, May 22.â The War Department is
proceeding on the theory that by the end of July
not a volunteer soldier will be left in Manila and
General Otis' report to-day that the transport Warren has
arrived advances the time when the homeward movement
of the volunteer troops will begin. Already information has
been received that mail for the First California Regiment
and the Second Oregon Regiment should not be sent to
Manila, but to San Francisco.
In anticipation of the prompt return of the volunteer
troops in the Philippines the Secretary of War to-day tele
graphed instructions to General Shatter, commanding the
department at San Francisco, to establish a model camp at
the Presidio for the accommodation of 4000 volunteers from
Manila pending their muster out.
General Shafter is instructed particularly to make ample
provision for water supply and sanitary features, "to the end
that the camp may be comfortable and healthful." He is in
formed that bedracks are to be furnished and floors laid if he
thinks it advisable.
The returning troops will leave their tents at Manila,
but will bring their field ranges and cooking outfits. The
quartermaster's department has been ordered to supply the
necessary tents to the camp at the Presidio.
Goldbaum says the name of the camp
is Cerro Pinta, and not Santa Clara.
The glowing reports have caused con
siderable excitement in this city, and
a number of men are making prepa
rations to g<> to the new fields on the
Bteamer St. Denis to-morrow night and
ttaÂ« schooner Anita on Thursday.
MARK TWAIN'S BOOK
A GIFT TO POSTERITY
The Present Work Will Not Be Pub-
lished Until a Hundred Years
After His Death.
LONDON. May 23.â A dispatch to the
Times from Vfenna says that Samuel L.
Clemens (Mark Twain) has postponed his
departure from that city until May 26 In
consequence of a notification from the
Emperor, communicated through Embas
sador Harris, that his Majesty will re
ceive him in audience May 23. During his
stay in Vienna Mr. Clemens has become
a welcome and familiar figure in Austrian
society, while the American colony, head
ed by the official representatives of the
United States, has not lost the opportu
nity to do him honor. Mr. Clemens told
the correspondent his new book, in which
he tells of the remarkable people he has
met from childhood, will occupy a great
part of the remainder of his life. It Is
a bequest to posterity and will only be
published a hundred years after his death.
The portraits were drawn solely for his
own pleasure in the work of .telling the
whole truth without malice, but' with re
spect to persons, conventions or pruderies.
The men and women depicted will appear
"with all their warts." The book will not
be written in "Mark Twain's" familiar
style, which, the author anticipates, will
be" forgotten by the time the work is pub
lished!:
TEXAS IS
VISITED BY
A TORNADO
Ruin and Death in the Track
of a Most Destructive
Storm.
CHURCHES ARE DAZED
Lightning and Hail Accompany the
Wind, and a Large Strip of
Country Is Swept.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOUSTON, Texas, May 22.â One of
the worst tornadoes that has visited
Texas since the storm which destroyed
the town of Cisco three years ago, and
in which some fifty people were killed,
passed over the business portion of
Frath County yesterday.
The storm came from the northwest
and passed in a southeasterly direction
over a strip of country about 200 yards
wide. The tornado was accompanied
by vivid lightning and a heavy hail
storm. Several homes and church
buildings were wrecked in several lo
calities, the mcst serious damage being
at Mount Pleasant, Titus County. The
noon services of the Baptist church had
just closed and the people were leav
ing when the wind struck the building.
A bait of lightning and the wind de
scended upon the house simultaneously,
wrecking it and scattering the debris
in all directions.
William Kauffman was instantly
killed and some fifteen other persons
were more or less injured, some fatally.
Three are in a dying condition, accord
ing to reports. A woman with a babe
in her arms was struck by lightning,
but miraculously escaped death. A lit
tle girl was stripped of her clothing, but
only slightly hurt.
The tornado struck Stephenville and
did considerable damage, wrecking
many houses, but no one was killed.
The Cumberland Presbyterian Church
was unroofed and badly damaged.
Many buildings in Stephenville were
leveled, among them the Methodist
church.
One man was killed and three in
jured near Dublin. It is reported that
several wore killed seven miles north
east of Stephenville. Trees and crops
in the wake of the storm are reported
to be destroyed, but authentic details of
the disaster have not been received.

MANILA. May~ 23. â President
Schurman of the Philippine Commis
sion made this statement to me to-day
concerning the plan of government
offered to the Filipinos :
"Now that the American arms are
successfully bringing the war to a
close it is an opportune moment to
submit the scheme of government
which is authorized by the President,
who believes that conciliation is as
necessary as force.
"The present scheme should
satisfy the legitimate aspirations of
the Filipino people for participation
in their own government. It gives
insurgents a good opportunity to fay
down their arms.
"Under it they will possess more
reedom than under the Malolos gov
ernment, even though the latter de
lares them an independent and
sovereign state."
MANILA, May 22.â 1n spite of the
presence of the Filipino com
missioners in Manila, the mili
tary operations continue with
unabated vigor. The visitors
were apparently ignorant of the true
condition of affairs here. Upon
their arrival they were immediately
inundated with invitations covering
both day and night, and express sur
prise at the condition of affairs within
our lines. They had been led to believe
that everything was chaotic and are de
lighted at the reception accorded them.
Reports received from persons who
have arrived from the interior show
that no troops are left in the northern
provinces. They were all drafted south,
after the outbreak of the war. The
villages on the west coast are almost
deserted, and the Uocanos especially
are desirous of joining the Americans,
if only for the purpose of crushing trie
Tagals. Many natives of Benguot and
Iloeos said that if the Americans had
not arrived civil war would necessariry
have ensued, owing to the friction be
tween the Tagals and the inhabitants
of other provinces. It is added that
the only Filipino troops left now are
7000 men under General Luna at the
Tarlac. and about 4000 under General
Pio del Pilar. These are short of arms
and suppUes. Many of their rifles are
disabled, and the Filipinos are unable
to repair them, owing to the lack of
mechanics and materials for so doing.
A coasting steamer which has ar
rived here reports that the Spanish
garrison at Zamboanga, Island of
Minandao, is held by the rebels in
much the same manner as the Ameri
cans held them while they were in the
vicinity of Manila. Every night the
Spaniards are subjected to an ineffec
tual fusillade, and if they are not soion
relieved they will be reduced to the
condition of the Spanish garrison at
Iloilo just previous to its evacuation of
that place.
Professor Schurman, head of the
United States. Philippine Commission,
has submitted the following written
propositions to the Filipinos:
While the final decision as to the form
of government for the Philippines is in
the hands of Congress the President, un
der his military powers, pending the ac
tinn of Congress stands ready to offer the
following:
A Governor General to be appointed by
the President; a Cabinet to be appointed
by the Governor General; all the Judges
to be appointed by the -President; the
heads of departments and Judges to in?
either Americans or Filipinos, or both;
and a general Advisory Council, its mem
bers to be chosen by the people by a form
of suffrage to be hereafter carefully de
termined upon.
The President earnestly desires that
blofwished cease and that the people of
the Philippines at an early date enjoy the
Largesi measure pi self-government com
patible with peace and order.
The United States Commission pre
pared the scheme and the President
cabled his approval of the form of the
document. The Filipinos have made
no definite proposition except for a ces
sation of hostilities until they can pre
sent the question of peace to the people.
Professor Schurman told the Filipinos
they had no means of gathering the
people together, as the Americans con
trol most of the ports. He also re
minded them that a liberal form of
government was offered them, and
pointed out that it was better than the
conditions existing under Spanish
rule.
Gozaga, President of the Filipino
commission, replied that nothing
could be worse than Spanish rule, and
admitted that the form of government
proposed was liberal.
The civilian members of the Filipino
commission have declined to co-operate
with the other members, as the former
consider Aguinaldo's latest demand to
be preposterous, after General Otis'
refusal of an armistice when the dic
tator asked for time in order to con
sult the Filipino Congress.
After a conference to-morrow with
the United States Commissioners, the
Filipino commissioners will lunch with
Professor Schurman, and will after
ward visit the vessels composing the
American fleet.

through a rough and little tra

the insurgents slipped away before they

The reported dissoluti< n of the insur
forces, which are said to be in bad
condition at Tarlae, and the statement
in General <vis' dispatch that he had
c i--'iU' i st for an
armistice, are taken to indicate that
there is some likelihood that the com
mission's i ffer of a form of govern
may be speedily accepted. That is a
matter, however, on which there is no
official information to speculate.
No particular Importance is attached
to the statement that the Filipinos are
threatening trouble In the s<>uth. The
American line in this direction is under
rnand of General Ovenshine and
stretches across a narrow neck of land
â  â  I'-A miles south of Manila between
the seacoast and Lacuna de Bai. It
is a position which the Filipinos could
not force under any conceivable* con
dition, while the tin clad fleet of the
iagoon and the warships off the coast
would be able to make the narrow
stretch of country between them a
very unhealthy resort tor any large
i if insurgents.
The written proposition submitted to
th.-- Filipinos to-day at Manila by the
American commission was framed in
Washington by Secretary Hay. The
only error i.n the printed copy of its
tits is th" of the qualifi
cation "principle" in the statement of
the judges to be appointed by the
President. It is the intention to give
the Filipinos, just as the President has
promised, as large a measure of self
government as they seem aM" t" ex
se with safety to themselves and
due regard to the welfare of other na
tions. Therefore, it is proposed to al
low them to choose their own inferior
judicial officials to begin with and per
haps the principle may be extended if
it works well in the lower grades.
President Schurman did not report to
Secretary Hay, hence it is assumed
that the conference up to this point has
not yet been productive of results as
to warrant a statement.

TROUBLE IN THE SANTA
CLARA HIGH SCHOOL
SAN* JOSE, May 22.â Trouble is brewing \
In the Santa Clara High School between :
the pupils who seceded from the San Jose
High School when Professor L. R. Smith j
was dismissed and the local pupils. So j
wide is the breach that David Henderson,
president of the Santa Clara Board of
Education, has resigned his office rather!
than fill the trying place of arbitrator.
The selection ol the place where the;
graduating exercises of the High School!
societies are to be hÂ«sld has i
aroused the ill feeling. The San j
Jose pupils outnumber the Santa Clara
ites and they boldly decided to have the j
exercises held at the Victory Theater In
this city. They wanted to bring the I
school graduation exercises here, but the I
trust-, s stepped in and chose the Uni
versity of the Pacific as the place. This i
is located halfway between the two towns '
and the Santa Clara pupils think the San '
JOM students want too much. The trou- j
ble may be as serious as the strike in the
local high school last year.
CHARGES ARE BASELESS.
PARIS, May 23.â The Figaro this morn- |
ing continues its review of the evidence
In the Dreyfus case, particularly that part I
affecting Colonel Plcouart'a story, which
demonstrates that the petit bleu originally i
reached Colonel Henry's hands piecemeal
by the usual methods. The fragments i
were mixed up with pieces of other seized
locuments, all of which Henry gave to
Lauth to reconstitute. The latter con-

Lauth only suggested falsification. The

CLASS OF '99
BIDS FAREWELL
TO ALMA MATER
Stanford Men and Women Who
Go Forth to Fight Life's
Battles.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 22.â
Senior class day opened with services in
the chapel this morning. Ralph Arnold,
president of the class, made a short ad
dress, after which â¢ he introduced Ralph
Filcher, who 1 proceeded to relate the his
tory of the class. He said in part:. .V,,'
The class upon entering college began to dab
ble in athletics and literature. Not content
with the ordinary pursuits of editing the dif
ferent college- papers, In their junior year they
took upon themselves the task of petting cut
the best annual ever produced at Stanford. The
book, according to the time honored costom,
did not go into the hands of a receiver, but
we can forgive our manager- for this.
The speaker dilated at length upon the
intellectual abilities of his class gnd then
took up athletics.
Five star football players, and worthy repre
sentatives "on the diamond and track,- we are
proud to claim. In addition to the records
of the' individual men, as evidence of the ac
tivity which "99 stands for In athletic lines,
the work of which has been done toward se
curing that much needed institutionâ a train
ing houseâ stnds boldly in the front. . All have
agreed upon th,- desirability of such a house;
many have suggested plans to secure it; but it
has remained for '99 to act.
An for the social side of life, '99 began bril
liantly and has consistently upheld the repu
tation gained four years ago. Our freshmen
glee was the first affair of the kind ever
given. Our junior hop was conceded to have
been unsurpassed.
Mr. Filcher then proceeded to praise
certain members of his class. Said he.
The most famous men, who/through mistake,
did enter college with any other clases, hve
since seen the error of their way and allied
themselves with '99. For their good tasteâ
that of the facultyâ the highest praise is due.
With the graduation of '99 there leave col
lege the last of those men who have known
and appreciated the spirit of the pioneers of
'95, whose acquaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present undergraduate
life of Stanford what it is; who developed its
traditions, its pleasures, and its college spirit.
We will be the only class that. has known both
the Intimate fellowship of the old university
and the larger life of the new.
We entered Stanford during her darkest hour.
Others who came after us and share in the
great tide of prosperity, may know the affec
tion that comes from its great bounty, but only
those who have felt the hopes and fears through
which the founders had to struggle can ever
experience such deep personal love for these
revered arches as is shared by the members
of '99.
Mr. Suzzallo delivered the last will and
testament of the class. To several society
men were bequeathed the benches in the
arboretum, provided that the use of the
benches shall be strictly limited to the
hours between 10 p. m. and 2 a. m. All the
remaining Bull Durham and dead soldiers
situate, lying and being within any tene
ment, structure or edifice on the campus
were bequeathed to the Runt Club. To
Carl Hayden, rough rider of Tempo. \
Ariz was bequeathed all the hair tonic
now in the possession of Judge Ellas. The ,
young ladies of Roble inherited undying
Love and affection, to be enjoyed by them
share and share alike. V r v'
Professor Murray spoke to the class
about the warm relations existing be
tween .professors and students, after
which the audience adjourned to the
quadrangle, where the class plate was in
serted in the pavement under the arcades
Dr Jordan gave the history of Stanford
from the day of its founding, through its
darkest hours to the present.
Many notable guests were present,
among whom were Rev. Burt tstees
Howard of Los Angeles.

"ATALANTA IN STANFORD."
Fantasy in Four Acts Presented by
Senior Class Talent.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 22
--"Atalanta In Stanford," a fantasy in four
acts, written by W. H. .Irwin, '99, was
presented in Encina gymnasium this
afternoon. Many visitors were present
and the "gym" could not comfortably
seat the crowd.
In the play the gpds and goddesses of
ancient Greece are transported to the ;
campus, and, during Dr. Jordan's ab
sence, he having accepted a position on
thÂ»- Bering Sea Sea! Commission, the god
Jupiter rules the university as president.
His family rules him.
As the ancient story goes, Atalanta was
finally beaten in a foot race and her
heart and hand won. after many suitors
had failed and been put to death. So At
alanta in Stanford was won in the same
way by "Jack" Blair, who had the aid of
Mercury, bod of his dad, Jupiter. Mer- â 
cury could assume any shape he desired
and ran the race all but the last lap, !
when 'Jack" linished it. winning by two
lengths. "Dick" Culver as Jupiter and
president of the University, was a suc
cess and would no doubt have pleased as
president in reality those students who j
are inclined to roystering, for he was a '
m^rry old soul. He permitted only those
liberties which were consistent with good I
scholarship, but every' form of gaiety ;
seemed consistent. Without any stretch |
of the imagination he reminded "his audi- i
ence of Edwin Stevens.
The football game as it will be played in
future years was introduced. It will de- !
llgrht esthetic people, for it is played in
dresa suits and a beribboned ball Is gen
tly handled from one to another, with
many apologies.
"The Ravings of Pringle." by Riley,
brought down the house. Pringle was
supposed to be in an insane asylum from
the effects of losing the "C" fence.
Another laughable feature was the drill
by the "Berkeley Cadets."
A sentimental love scene between
Apollo, who is blase, and Hattie Blake
was cleverly sung and acted. Claire
Strohn did some good "stunts" with his
feet and the chorus of gods, goddesses, '
Japs, co-eds and quadrangle cavaliers
was almost perfect. The show was a
success and "Bill" Irwin, the author, was
called to the front for a talk.
The cast for the farce was as follows:
Atalanta, devoted to athletics Miss C. Rose
Jar-k Blair, devoted to Atalanta W. M. Erb
Hattie Blake, a freshman Miss E. B. Zucker i
A Uypsy Miss E. Lewis \
Jupiter, who conducts Olympus R. K. Culver i
Juno, who conducts Jupiter Mist H. Holmes
Venus, popular in society Miss \V. Morgan
Mercury, a freshman but keen âJ. S. Brlseoe
Apollo, who is blase P. R. Itiley
Mar? â¢. A. J. Van Kaathoven
Neptune Claire .Strohn.
Adder Claws, who rules Encina J. S. Briscoe
Chorus or" koclp, fjoddesses, Japs, co-eda and
quadrangle cavaliers.
The seniors, freed from all further care '
in the matter of studies and credits, en- ,
Joyed themselves to-night by tripping the
light fantastic to the tunes of Yank's ;
orchestra. It was the society event of the
year. Flcancially it was a success, as the
hall was crowded and each claw-hammer
coat that entered had to pungle up $5 for
itself and the accompanying lady, besides
squandering 50 cents for necessary pro
grammes. The hall was beautifully dec
orated, the women handsomely gowned
in evening costume, and calcium lights
added to the brilliant effect. Among the
noted guests were ex-Governor Markham,
Timothy Hopkins and T,urt Estes Howard.
The patronesses were. Mesdames Tim
othy Hopkins, David Starr Jordan, J. C.
Branner, G. H. Gillman. Braden, Rice,
Pierce. Cubberly, J. P. Smith, Pease,
Matzke, Griffin, Van Kaathoven. Barnard,

Resolution Arouses a Spirited Debate
in the B'nai B'rith
Session.
LOUISVILLE, May 22.â At the second
session of the Independent Order of B'nal
B'rith to-day a resolution was offered pe
titioning the Grand Lodge, which will
meet In San Francisco, to introduce
a more impressive ritual. This aroused a
spirited debate, and it was at last re
ferred to the ritual committee.
A memorial service was held in honor
of the late Isador Bush, the Jewish phi
lanthropist of St. Louis, who died re
cently.
The project to establish a hospital at
Denver, Colo., for Jewish consumptives
at an outlay of $15,000 a year was dis
cussed at great length in the afternoon

to-morrow. Jacob Furth, the St. Louts
Â£hilanthroplst, and Dr. Alfred Muller of
>enÂ«ver led the fight for the hospital.

NEW YORK, May 22.-The Fitzsim
mons-Jeffries contest will take place in i
the evening of June 9. This decision was i
reached by the directors of the Coney j
Island Club at a meeting to-day. The con
clusion was reached through the offer of j
a prominent picture firm, which assured
tae club people It can take successful
moving pictures by the use of electric

GAGE IS DODGING
OFFICE SEEKERS
Retires to His Downey
Ranch.
SEEKING REST AND QUIET
MAY SOON MAKE WHITTIER
APPOINTMENTS.
The Paris World's Fair Commission
Probably Will Name Major
Ben C. Truman as Its
Secretary.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 22.â Governor
Henry T. Gage arrived on the early train
this morning. He left for his ranch near i
Downey an hour after his arrival, to
avoid the persistent office-seeker, of j
whom Gage admits he is tired.
The Governor Intends to fill the two va
cancies on the Whittier Reform School
board before he leaves, if the factions
now contesting for control of the school
shall agree. Should this be found impos
sible, the Governor will, it was intimated
to-day, appoint a board which shall se
lect as Superintendent Van Alstyne's sue- j
cessor neither Dr. Barber nor Sherman I
Smith. In that event T. E. Newlin. for- !
merly County Cterk, or Mayor M. T. |
Owens will be chosen to preside over the
dt'stlnies of the school.
"A great many persons are fooling ;
themselves Into the belief that I will !
appoint a superintendent of the State
School at Whittier," said Mr. Gage. "I !
am getting letters and telegrams by the j
cord, asking about Whittier and other j
places. I have absolutely nothing to do j
with the appointment ot a superintend- j
rnt. After I have named the .trustees for
the institution I expect them to choose
the superintendent. It is so with the !
normal schools and the university. When
I name the trustees or the regents it is |
all left to them to select a superintendent j
or president. I shall appoint no trustees j
for Whittier until after I have visited the
institution."
Mr. Gage's friends to-night insist that
he has come south with the intention of ;
visiting all the public institutions in |
Southern California. In reply to a direct j
question the Governor said he had not ap
pointed a Labor Commissioner, and was j
looking over petitions.
Next Monday the Governor, accom- j
panied by Mrs. Gage and Mr. and Mrs.
George J. Denis, will leave for Yosemite.
Dr. E. A. Bryant also- will be in the party
and Senator and Mrs. Stephen M. White
may take the trip.
L. L. Maude of Riverside, who has just
been appointed State Highway Commis
sioner, will, it is Â«aid, name Assembly
man Miller of Clearw/uer as his secretary.
Mr. Miller voted for Colonel D. M. Burns '
for T'nited States Senator on the day the I
recent Legislature adjourned.
Major Ben C. Truman said to-day the |
Paris Commission would meet in San j
Francisco for organization in about ten |
days. Regarding the appointment of a i
secretary Mr. Truman said:
"That will not be determined until the
Commissioners get together. .1 think the j
secretary will be one of the throe Commis- '
sioners. I am averse to appointing an
outside secretary, who would have ex- <
ecutive power. If my colleagues think as
I do the only appointments to be made i
will be clerical. I think we should have
some good men look after the interests
of their respective localities. Most of the '
help we will need we can employ better in
Paris."
Mr. Truman's friends insist to-night !
that this practically means the appoint- j
ment of Truman himself. A now appli- j
cant for secretary appeared to-day in
Otheman E. Stevens, who, it is said, has !
the ear of Gage and his friends.
Martin Aguirre, the new warden of San I
Quentin, will consult with Governor Gage !
as to his line of policy before he assumes j
office on July 1. There are to be no whole
sale discharges of prison guards and other !
employes, as was hoped by the hundreds
of persons who have for w r ecks been seek
ing positions at the penitentiary, although
a weeding out is to be made.
Water Case Award Accepted.
LOS ANGELES, May 22.â The City
Council to-day formally accepted the
award In the water company ease by the
arbitration board and decided to call upon
the water company for a statement of
what the company intends to do. There
is some talk among the Oouneilmen of a

quired to acquire the water plant to be
offered to local capitalists and individuals.

BABY STOLEN
BY THE NURSE.
Bold Case of Kidnaping
at New York.
AN INFANT IS STOLEN
NOTE WRITTEN TO THE MOTHER,
WHO MAY DIE
The Abductors Declare That the Lit
tle One and Nursegirl Are
Safe if No Fuss Is
Made.
Special Dispatch to The CalV
NEW YORK. May 22.â What ap
peared to be a bold case of kidnaping
a child was reported to the police to
day, and a score of detectives were at
once sent out In an endeavor to arre^.^^
the offenders. The missing child i.-^
Marion, the eighteen-months-ola
daughter of Arthur Clark, an employe
of a publishing firm. She was taken,
the police say, by a nurse named Carrie
Jnnes, who was hired last week by the
Clarks through an advertisement.
The whole thing seems to have been
a cleverly laid plot. The child wa>
taker, out yesterday afternoon by the
nurse and the empty baby carriage was
found by the police in Central Park.
Soon afterward Mrs. Clark received
this letter:
"Mrs. Clarkâ Do not look for your
nurse and baby. They are safe in our
possession, where they will remain for
the present. If the matter is kept out
of the hands of the police and news
papers you will get your baby back
safe and sound. If, instead, you make
a big time about it and publish it all
over we will see to it that you never
see her alive again. We are driven t>>
this by the fact that we cannot get
work and one of us has a child dying
through want of proper treatment and
nourishment. Your baby is safe and in
good hands. The nurse girl is still with
her. If everything is quiet, you will
hear from us Monday or Tuesday."
There is evidence to show that the
nurse girl wrote the letter. Mrs. Clark
is in a serious condition, and the
suspense may cause her death.
PLANS FOR THE VALLEY
ROAD DEPOT AT FRESNO
It Is Said the Division Headquarters
Will Be Removed From
Stockton.
FRjJSNO, May 22.â Surveyors have
staked the ground plan for a handsome
passenger depot in this city for the Val
ley road. Work on the structure will be
commenced immediately upon the letting
of the contract, involving an expenditure
of about $15. (mm), and it is expected to have
the depot ready for occupancy to accom
modate the increased traffic in July, when
the junction with the Santa Fe will be
completed and through continental trains
will be running to San Francisco. The
depot will be a two-story structure of at
tractive design and will follow the Span
ish mission style, after which all the pas
senger depots on the VaJley road have
been built.
It is said that with the completion of tne
building division headquarters will be re
moved from Stockton to this city, the
plans of the depot building contemplating
in the upper story office rooms for the
divisional officials.

AMERICANS ON
ALL COMMITTEES
The Peace Conference
Ready for Work.
Sppcial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 22.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
Secretary Hay received a dispatch to-day
from Mr. Holls. secretary of the American
delegation to The Hague conference an
nouncing the appointment of American
members of the various committees or
ganized by the conference. The authori
ties are especially gratified that Embas
s=ador 'White Is a member of all the im
portant committees, as that will enable
him. it is hoped, to exercise great influ
ence over the conference.
I understand that since the arrival of
the American delegates at The Hague
they have been performing some mission
ary work among other delegates in sup- j
port of the plan of arbitration which they I
are especially charged to press upon the j
conference. The fact that Russia is de
sirous of compulsory arbitration Is be
lieved to be of importance as bearing on !
the fate of the American plan. A com
pulsory plan is regarded as Impracticable,
and it is thought that trie conference will
be willing to accept as a compromise the
American suggestion for the organization
of a permanent arbitral tribunal of lim
tlted power, to which nations In contro
versy may submit disputes if they desire
to do so.
It is considered strange that the Presi
dent should be urging arbitration for
adoption by the world, when in two' re
cent instances he has rejected it. .In the
Pears case the Honduras Government
suggested arbitration, which was dis
tinctly refused, and the demand for In
demnity pressed, and now in the Alaskan
boundary controversy Great Britain has
been given to understand that this Gov
ernment will not accept the proposition
for arbitration which she has advised.
The apparent contradiction in the pres
net attitude arises solely out of a misun
derstanding of his position. He believes
that it is wise for nations to have an
arbitral tribunal to which they may re
fer disputes If they desire, to adopt such
a course, but where it is manifestly to
the injury of the interests of one of the
nations he has no hesitancy in declaring
against action of this character. A repe
tition of the outrages upon American citi-
zens In Central America has caused the
administration to determine to give Hon
duras a lesson. In the case of the Alas
kan boundary controversy, while satisfied
with the justice of the American conten
tion the President does not feel that he
would be justified in submitting to one
man or a court, a question which Is of
Buch'vast importance to this country, and
more probably as the people of the Pacific
coast would sustain great damage if a
Jaundiced arbiter should decide that Great
Britain is entitled to a portion of what
is now considered Alaskan territory.

have been circulated regarding these

that Count yon Munster. the German Em
bassador at Paris and head of the Ger
man delegation, would withdraw from the
conference. Such stories must be re
ceived with caution, as persons hostile
to the aims of the conference have been
busily engaged in spreading distrust. The
story about Count yon Munster probably
arose from the fact that his name does
not appear as a member of any of the
committees, while the other chief s of dele
gations have joined one or more commit

tending toward peace and rendering war J
more humane. All worp dominated by
a sense of responsibility to achieve some
thing, especially in the direction of arbi
tration. The delegates wcrp unanimously
of the opinion that the question of the
redaction of armament would be the most
difficult to meet, and it Is believed that it
will be relegated to the rear of the other |
two features, especially since the special
object of the congress is now acknowl- j
edged to be an endeavor to establish
means for the solving of international
difficulties without recourse to war. thus
Increasing the reality of wars and as a ;
natural consequence leading to a reduc- !
tion of armaments.
After an active exchange of views dur- ,
ing the last twenty-four hours, the chiefs
of the various delegations arrived this j

GENERAL DEPOT AT TRACY.
Distributing Point for the Tesla Coal
Company.
STOCKTON, May 22. -A. D. Shepard of |
the Southern Pacific Company was at I
Tracy to-day inspecting the 2000 feet of
siding and crossing which have been put
In to accommodate the Tesla-Corral Hol
low Coal Company. The arrangement was
< ntered into some time ago by the two I
companies, the coal company being anx
[OUÃ to obtain, a general depot at Tracy
to facilitate distribution to points more
convenient to that station than to Stock
ton. It is understood the arrangement Is j
a simple business agreement and has no j
significance as to the policy or control I
of th< output of the mines. The Tesla,
company is developing its great holdings
as fast as possible. W. J. Bartnett of
the Tepla company is to-day quoted as
saying:
â Active development work on the lime
deposit will begin immediately and a i
tramway 3000 feet long will be built from
the deposit to the railroad as soon as
possible. This deposit of lime, which is
Inexhaustible, is of an especially fine j
character, running H"Vs per cent pure lime.
There is also a large deposit of clay near
by, which Is needed in the manufacture
of Portland cement. The Tesla company
proposes to go into that business, and It
means much to the Pacific ('oast. There
has always been great need of such de
posits on the coast for the manufacture
of cement, and as there is an inexhausti
ble supply of the necessary materials at
Tesla the enterprise will no doubt be very
successful."

form are somewhat disappointed with
the result of the deliberations of the
Republican caucus committee appoint
ed to formulate a legislative pro
gramme. It had been hoped that the
members of this commission would
agree on a comprehensive scheme of
currency and bank reform that would
command the support of a majority in
each house of Congress.
This cnmmitteee was, however, con
fronted by the fact that whatever bill
is carried through Congress must be
put forward as a Republican party
measure and must have the support
practically of all the Republican mem
bers in the House, where their major
ity is very small.
There were disagreeemnts among the
members of the .committee themselves,
and even those who were prepaned to
indorse the principle of the Indianapolis
scheme were unable to get together as
to details. The very moderate scheme
agreed upon by committeemen repre
sents not only their judgment as to
what they will be able to get through
the House, but what they were able to
agree upon themselves.
The programme, however, is gener
ally looked upon as a step in the right
direction. It proposes to adopt defi
nitely the gold standard by enacting
into positive law what is not largely a
matter of construction and precedent,
and making all obligations of the coun
try payable in gold on demand. The
proposition to reissue greenbacks only
in exchange for gold will, if enacted,
destroy the "endless chain" and pre
vent the same greenbacks being used
time after time to withdraw gold from
the treasury.
< inly two propositions are made to. In
crease the volume of the national bank
circulation. It is proposed to permit
banks to issue notes up to the par
value of their bonds and to permit the
establishment of banks of $25,000 capi
tal in small towns. It is expected that
the first of these will lead to a consid
erable increase in national bank cir
culation, as it will tend to increase the
profits on note issues.
The proposed authorization of banks
of small capital in small towns is to
meet the complaint of communities in
the South and West that they are com
pelled to do their banking in large cities
and that the profits of this business are
withdrawn from their neighborhoods.
There is no possibility <^f any ideal
financial legislation being enacted by
the Fifty-sixth Congress, and it is not
improbable that even the moderate
measure proposed by the caucus com
mittee will fail.
DIVIDEND FOR DEPOSITORS,
Directors of the Union Savings Bank
Levy an Assessment.
SAN JOSE, May 22.â The directors of
the Union Savings Bank this morning lev
ied an assessment of $10 a share on the
10.000 shares of the bank stock. ,A good
deal of this cannot be collected Without
suit, but the assessment should bring in
nearly $!V),000. This, with some â¦on .ooo now
in the vaults, will be paid In dividends to
the depositors.
Expert "William reported on the trans
actions of Mrs. Myra E. Wright, wife
of President \V. H. Wright, with the
bank, in which the banking property was
transferred to Mrs. Wright to secure a
loan of $60,000. It showed she had been
given eleven certificates of deposit ag
gregating $50,000 and certificate for $10,000
borrowed from the bank by her hus
band. The expert says:
In conclusion I will say that I see nothing In
this transaction that appears to me anything
but a straight forward business matter.
LAND-OWNERS PROTEST.
San Jose-Alviso Electric Road Project
Receives a Setback.
SAN JOSE, May 22.â The Board of Su
pervisors to-day refused to grant a fran
chise for an electric railway to Alviso,
'â  along the county road from the northerly
i limits of this city. A resolution was
| adopted, however, that whenever the
; property-owners on either side of the
! road would consent to a railway being
* built there a franchise would lie given.
A large number of residents were pres
ent and protested against the road, es
pecially in th'> center of the roadway.
Representatives of the Los Gatos Roard
of Trade askt-d that the Supervisors
grant the franchise as it meant ultimate
ly a road to Los Gatos.
A. Greeninger and the capitalists at the
head of the enterprise are not discour
aged over the refusal, and will try to ob
tain the consent of property-owners.
San Joaquin County Crops.
STOCKTON, May 22.â The first week of
June will see several carloads of peaches
shipped from the Acampo district to East
ern markets. The peaches are ripening
rapidly. There will be a magnificent crop
in the northern end of the county, in
spite of the fact that the trees lost nearly
four-lifths of their blossoms when they
first came out. Almonds and prunes will
be comparatively light and there will not
be enough apricots to supply the local
demand. The Vangelder and Thornton
orchards are the only ones where the out
look for the latter fruit is encouraging.
The fruit shippers are already on the
ground, and it is probable the competi
tion may wring good results to orchard
ists. Heretofore one company has come
near controlling the output of this rich
district. Peach growers are encouraged,
as it is understood that crop failures in
the East will create a brisk demand for
their product. '

WOODLAND, May 22.â Calvin Ruddick

PEDESTRIANS ENDANGERED.
Two Negroes Fight a Bloodless Duel
in Chicago.
! CHICAGO, May 22.â Lives of pedestrians
!on Dearborn street, between Twenty-
I seventh and Twenty-ninth, were placed
I in danger to-night by two colored men,
I who emptied revolvers In firing at each
other from behind trees on opposite sides
of the street in the most approved fron
tier fashion. The shooting occurred be-
I tween 7 and 8 o'clock, when many resi
! dents in the vicinity were going to even
ing service at the church at Thirtieth and
Dearborn streets.
One of the men, who was drunk, was
walking along the street, when he saw
! the enemy across the street. Drawing
j a revolver he began to fire at the man,
who promptly got behind a tree, and,
drawing his own revolver, returned the
fire. The first man to open fire also got
behind a tree. When his revolver was
empty the first man decided to quit his
hiding place back of the tree and start
ed to run. He went but a few steps when
he stumbled and fell. Immediately a cry
of "Murder!" was raised, and persons
who had hastily left the section in which
; the firing took place returned to assist
the man they supposed had been wounded.
It was found no one had been 1 hurt.
This fusillade, following the battle In
the same neighborhood this morning,
! when two men were killed and another
I fatally wounded, caused a panic among
I the residents.

PRESBYTERIANS
ARE DEMOCRATIC
Refuse to Reduce Pres
ent Representation.
POPULAR WITH THE PEOPLE
ASSEMBLY VOTES DOWN THE
PLANS PRESENTED.
Many Other Subjects of Great In
terest to the Church Are
Considered During the
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MINNEAPOLIS. - May 22.â Democracy
asserted itself in the Presbyterian Gen
eral Assembly this afternoon. With a
shout the assembly voted down two care
fully considered* and prepared plans to
reduce the membership, one by a third
and the other by more than a half. The
committee on reduced representation, ap
pointed a year ago, was scarcely given
courteous treatment, so pronounced was
the fce'.'iig against getting farther away
from the people. Two members of the
committee presented the two proposed
plansâ on making the basis of representa
tion 6000 communicants and the other
making the basis thirty-six ministers In
the presbyteries instead of twenty-four,
as at i resent. Colonel F. L. Hitchcock of
the committee, argued for the representa
tion by synods, according to membership
and declared that there was no doubt
that 672, the present membership of the
assembly, "was far too large. It was
' plain, from the " interruptions, that
Colonel Hitchcock was not on the popu
lar side, and when he -sat down expres
sions of the democratic spirit .ame out
strongly and profusely.
"They call this a mob," said Dr. Page
of Topeka, Kans. "If it is a mob, God
grant that there may be more such. God
pity the Presbyterian church with the
bulk of the wealth of the United States
in its coffers, if it cannot afford a large
assembly." "'â¢
"The time has not come to reduce the
assembly, and I hope it never will come,"
cried Dr. George W. P. Bierch of New-
York. ' "We ought to keep as near the
people as we can. â¢ The backwoods pres
byteries now hold the balance of power;
I don't know what we would do without
them, they hold the balance so true."
Impressed by the strength. of the oppo
sition, a friend of reduced representation
proposed to send an overture -town to the
presbyteries asking their advice. The mo
tion was promptly laid on the table.
Dr. John W. Dinsmore of San Jose of
fered a substitute motion thanking and
discharging the committee and indeflnite
lv referring the question of reduced rep
resentation. When the vote came, there
was a mighty "Yes" and a feeKe "No."
The decision against another part of
the senate committee's report was closer.
By a vote of 184 to 168 the assembly decid
i ed not to increase from live to ten the
i number of ministers necessary to consti
tute a orttbytery.
The judicial committee reported on a
number of matters and was granted per
mission to reier to special committor tor
trial such cases as required supreme ad
judication.
The appealed case of Herman Warsa
wiack, suspended for alleged gambling
from the Fourth Avenue Church,- New
York, two years ago, was referred to a
committee.
The Rev. Mr. Backus of Kansas got a
committee to try his appeal from the
synod of that State. E. R. Day of the
presbytery of Waterloo was advised to
present his case to the synod of Iowa.
Dr. W. R. Kirkwood of Emporia. Kans.,
presented a report of the committee of the
board of education. The report held that
the expense of the board was not undue
and that it could not be reduced without
consolidation of boards, which was not
wise. The standard of ministerial educa
tion was declared not to be declining, and
the. day of shrinkage in the number of
candidates for the ministry was said to be
in the past. The re-election of the mem
bers of the board whose terms expire this
year was recommended.
The Chicago and Schuyler overtures,
calling for a commission to investigate
the whole subject of ministerial education,
were approved by the committee, and it
was recommended that a committee of not
less than eleven be appointed for that
purpose. The report was adopted intact.
The McGIffert matter was made a spe
cial order for Thursday. The feeling now
is that drastic action will be taken.
The denunciation of recent mob out
rages in the South made in the report of
the committee of freedmen was finally re
ferred to that committee for reconsidera
tion. Colonel James Rice of Peoria, 111.,
the father of the Peoria overture, aimed
at reducing the moderator's power, says
he expects vigorously to push his meas
ure. â -.'.'-. â '! :; .''â â 
The overtures now before the committee
on bills and overtures in favor of expell
ing Congressman Roberts of Utah from
the House of Representatives are likely
to be passed by the assembly almost
unanimously if they get by the commit
tee.
Before the popular meeting to-night of
the Freedman's Board, the largest of the
meetings held under the auspices of the
assembly. Rev. H. W. Hulbert of Cleve
land, originator of the movement to raise
the $40,000 Indebtedness ot the board, an
nounced that subscriptions and appor
tionments will foot up $50,000 or $55,000. For
the first time in a generation all depart
ments of the Presbyterian church are free
from debt. It was announced, however,
that every presbytery is expected to pay
the portion of the debt apportioned to it,
as all excess above the quota which any
presbytery gives will be devoted to open
ing some of the schools which have been
been closed for lack of funds.

HUNTINGTON INSPECTS
WORK ON THE GAP
Despite the Obstacles Presented, the
Construction Force Is Being
Increased.
SANTA BARBARA. May 22.â President
Collis P. Huntington of the Southern Pa
cific Company and a party of sixteen, in
cluding Messrs. Hood, Frazier, Krutt
schnitt, H. E. Huntington, Mrs. C. P.
Huntington and others, spent Saturday
afternoon and night at the Cojo ranch
house, five miles from the San Anita
ranch, part of the Hollister estate, and
which is he only remaining obstruction
to the completion of the "gap." It was
rumored to-day that Harry .nollister.
manager of the estate, and C. P. Hun
tington had come to an agreement, but
Hollister flatly denies it. Huntington
spent his time at and nenr Surf, looking
over the work of construction at the dif
ferent railroad cam-s.
Whether or not an agreement has been
reached by the president and the ob
structionists, the forces are continually
being increased. The contractors at the
Surf end have added in the neighborhood
of fifty men and as many teams during
the last week. On Friday twenty men
came up from Los Angeles and went to
the MeCormick camp near Ellwood and
yesterday twenty-five more were added
to his force. MeCormick went to Los
Angeles to-day to engage many more
teams and men.
The MeCormick camp has Increased
from 100 to 200 men during the last five
days. It is confidently believed that all
difficulties will be settled at the mass
meeting to be held in this city to-morrow
to discuss the situation. ,
PACIFIC MAIL'S
BOOMING BUSINESS
NEW YORK, May 22.â Interests identi
fied with the property are predicting: that
the annual report of the Pacific Mail
Company, which is to be made public at
the annual meeting of the stockholders
on May 31, will make a remarkably good
showing.
In the eleven months ended March 31
the net earnings increased more than
$500,000 over the corresponding period of
the previous year, and April was, it is
said, an unusuually good month.
Already the management is figuring on
the probability of having to charter addi
tional steamers in order to keep up with
the demand for freight room.
Much talk has been heard recently re
garding the probability of increased divi
dends on Pacific Mail stock, the heavy
earnings of the past year and promising
outlook for coming months having led to
a hope that something of this kind would
be decided upon by the management at
the next dividend period. It is pointed
out that the company now has on hand a
surplus large enough to pay dividends at
the present rate for the next three years,
and it is safe to figure on earnings from
now on sufficient to pay for two steamers
which are now being constructed under a
contract to be finished in a year, and
which will cost about $3,500,000. People
close to the management of the company
are quoted as statfng that the outlook for
Pacific Mail is bright enough to warrant
raising the dividend rate to 5 per cent.

an amendment to tho resolution of au- i
inorization that the rate charged be
changed from $1 o'J per thousand feet to '
$1 10 per thousand feet. The amendment
was lost by a vote of 7 to 5, and Perrault
gave notice of a motion to reconsider the |
vote. This action hung the bills up for a j
week. Yesterday when the- motion to re- â¢
consider came up it was lost by the fol
ng vote:
Noes â Aigeltinger, Attridge, Black, Col-
Kalben, Holland. Phelps, 7; ayesâ
Bylngton, Dt-asy, Heyer, Lackmann, i't-r
--rault. 5.
The question was then on the final pas
page of the authorizations, and PerrauU
moved to amend the authorizations by
making tbe rate to be paid for gas $i 09
instead of Jl 50. and to reduce the rate
charged for electric lights 26 percent The ;
on the amendment w;is:
Noesâ Aigeltinger. Attridge, Black, Col- |
lins, }) â Hand. Kalben, PI tyesâ
Byington, Deasy, Heyer, Lackmann, Per- *
rault. 5.
Perrault thÂ«-n pave notice of a motion to
whereby the amend
ment was lost. This gave I storm
. f dissent from the majority members, as
they realized that such action would tie i
up the bills for another week. The Mayor,
â . er, ruled the proceeding to he 1
r. In the meantime Attorney Bishop .
asked for and obtained the consent of the I
board is It. He begged the board
ort to dilatory tactics but to
take some definite and final action. He
wanted such action taken, he said, b< -
. he was led to believe the Mayor
veto the authorizations even were
they passed. If this were done it would j
give his clients an opportunity to appeal j
to the courts, a proceeding which he de- j
. to be what the gas company most
urgently desired.
Perrault suggested to Mr. Bishop that
there wa^j a matter of something more i
Than 1186,000 involved In the payment of
the bills, and if the gas company did not
come to time soon there would probably
be no money left in th<=> treasury to pay
them with. He added that the board had
put Itself on r< â  Ing in favor of a
rnte of *1 10 for gas, but that if the gas
compa-ny showed a diposition to do the
right thing and come forward with a
proposition the board might be induced
to compromise by paying the bills at the
rate of $1 35. â¢
This was not what Mr. Bishop wanted.
He declared that the board Bhould author
ize the payment of the bills as presented
and allow the Mayor to veto them so that
the matter could be taken to the courts.
He said that the board could not expect
ihf> pas company to u:o on furnishing gas
ut a loss and that it would not do so.
Mayor Phelan recommended to Mr.
Bishop that he make Â«ome proposition to
the board for a reduction of the rate
charged, making the somewhat unneces
t-arv explanation that the dilatory tac
tics adopted by the minority were for the
purpose of forcing the company to come
to terms, it being apparent that it could
not be Induced to make a fait rate in any
other way. Bishop replied that he was
not empowered by his cli< nts to make
any such proposition as that suggested by
the Mayor and that he would not do bo.
He then madf another appeal to theboard
to pass the bills, but without avail. The
majority could see no way in which the
defensive tactics of the minority and the
rulings of the Mayor could be overcome.
As the case now stands there can be no
final action until the next meeting of the
lo.'ird, and in the meantime the amount
of available money in th>- general fund
grows beautifully lea â¢. if was a very bad
day for the corp i it ad the prospects
for the future are ni I ai all i ncouraging'.

STRAW BONDS
THE SUBJECT OF
INVESTIGATION
The Methods of Clerk
Kelly Exposed.
GRAND JURY IS INTERESTED
MORE INDICTMENTS AGAINST
"PETE" McGLADE.
Accused of Robbing the City While
Acting as Bookkeeper in the
Iffir.e of Superintendent
of Streets.
The numerous straw hpnds that have
been accepted by Police Court Clerk Kelly
i were the subject of investigation by the
! Grand Jury yesterday. Police Captain
Seymour was called to testify to the
worthlessness of the bonds accepted by
: the clerk of Judge Graham's court. Sey
. mour exhibited over a hundred bonds ac
; cepted by Kelly and which were pro
nounced worthless by Bond Expert New
man. In the majority of cases where
criminals were released on bonds the
names of William Gallagher and "Mike"
; Flynn, saloon-keepers, were named as
sureties. Flynn and Gallagher keep a
n on Grant avenue and Morton
' street. Kelly had an "office" in the sa
loon where he has been in the habit of
accepting bogus bonds. D. Becker and
] his brother, Abe, both of whom are sa
loon-keepers, appear3d before the Grand
i Jury and were closely questioned rela
tive to the straw bond business. It de
. veloped at the investigation that the
! Beckers have been responsible for the
release of several criminals on bonds ac
cepted by Kelly.
The brothers admitted that they had
signed their names to bonds for the re
' lease of a number of prisoners for politi
; cal reasons.
"It is this way," declared D. Becker,
. who conducts a saloon at 5 Mason street.
"We are not in business for oiir health.
! In every rase where I went as surety on
! a bond I did so as a matter of business.
When a frequenter of my saloon had the
' misfortune to' bo arrested I gladly con
-1 sented to become one of the bondsmen
rather than have him stay in jail over
night."
Becker admitted that he "went good
for s.-veral female lonizens of the ten-,,
derloin who were arrested for transgress
ing the law.
Charles Lederer. whose name appears
' on a number of bonds which were ac
i cepted by Clerk Keily, was also closely
questioned. He admitted that he was on
friendly terms with Kelly and did not
hesitate when necessary to ask him to ac
tept him as a surety on a bond. Lederer
, frankly confessed that he was paid for
his services, frequently receiving as much
as VJfl to sign his name to a bond for the
release of a woman charged with grand
larceny.
By dint of inquiry the Grand Jury has
learned that in many cases where crim
inala have been released the necessary
bonds were, not furnished until the day
: following their temporary discharge from
custody. In one Instance it was shown
1 that a notorious woman named Flossie
1 O'Brien, who is known as the queen <>i
pl( kpockets, was released on an order
signed by Clerk Kelly five minutes after
she had been arrested. The following
morning the necessary bonds were fur
-1 nished and placed on record in the court.
"Billy" Gallagher, when questioned be
fore the Grand Jury, acknowledged that
I he had a number of blank bail bonds and
orders of discharge h a desk in bis sa
loon. As soon as one of his customers
was arrested he would have Clerk Kelly
make out an order for the release of his
friend. He emphatically denied that he
I was aware that Kelly was in the habit
! of issuing an order of discharge before
the requisite bonds were furnished.
At the conclusion of the investigation
â  into the straw bond business the Grand
Jury again took up the cases of Peter Mc-
Glade, the ex-bookkeeper in the office of
the Superintendent of Streets. After a
short investigation they returned two ad
'> dttional indictments against the disgraced
â¢ official.
It is understood that the indictments
are for forgery in collecting money from
' the city on "dummy" warrants.
/\iCcsza ".
"In Mlzzoura," Gus Thomas' sue
â  cessful play, was presented at the Alca
â  zar last night and there was scarcely a
1 vacant seat. It bids fair to score as great
â  a popularity as It did last September. The
: simple homely life of the dwellers in Pike
County, Mo., interrupted by the introduc
tion of a stage-robber and the consequent
i upheaval in the family circle of the vil
: lage blacksmith was well portrayed by
I the stock company. Ernest Hastings
i gave another proof of. his versatility as
Jim Radburn, the Sheriff of the county,
, and scored a pronounced success. He was
quiet and effective throughout. One of
' the best bits of character work seen on
the Alcazar stage for a long time was
the 'Lizbeth Vernon of Miss Maybelle
Bowman. She made a decided hit and
was ably seconded by Clarence Montaine
as .Dave. Charles Bryant as Joe Vernon,
, the blacksmith: George I. Webster as
: Robert Travers, Howard Scott as Colonel
Bellinger. Miss Adelaide Fitzallen as
i Kate Vernon, Miss Marie Howe as Mrs.
Joe Vernon and Miss Laura Crews as
j Em'ly Radburn. The play was well
â  staged.
Orpheum.
Moung Toon and Moung Chet, the Bur
mese jugglers, who ply their craft with

tion of the four new turns at the Or
pheum. These gentlemen â on the road
from Mandilay wear ,the native summer
costume, a bib for the loins, a turban and
India-ink decorations on the upper
! part ct the legsâ nothing else. With their
feet, lcga, head and shoulders they do
tricks in Jugglery that ordinary ball-toss
i ers would be glad to do with the assist
' ance of aU of their hands. Th-j act is
absolutely new to this country, and tre
, mendously entertaining. Billy Van, the
reformed minstrel, is. the best of the oth
.er new-comers. He has a batch of new
stories, , one of which, is suggestive but
undeniably clever. Montgomery and
Stone repeat the rag songs and dances
and monkey imitations that won them a
hit some time ago, and the Donovans do
one of those fixture "josh" dialogues in
; which the woman's face, form and hair
are made the butts of the man's podgy

in Fitch's Play.

GYPSY BARON."
Burmese Jugglers at the Orpheum
Who Work Without Hands.
"In Mizzoura" Again at
the Alcazar.
"The Moth and the Flame," which
Herbert Kelcey and Effie Shannon
presented in the Columbia Theater
last night to an unusually la/ge and
modish audience, is, in the main, very
much like the pictures of it that you
see on the billboards. That scene in
the churchâ where the villain at the
altar in the act of wedding the spotless
heroine when the ceremony is parted
in the middle by the entrance of the
other woman and her fatherless child â
is played just as advertised. Mr. Kel
cey does strike his cast-off victim a
cruel blow on the brow, and the girl
who is about to become his bride utters
a withering "Coward!" The plot and
the main situations remind you for
cibly of Miss Laura Jean Libby. Mr.
David Belasco himself has never suc
ceeded in being more Laura Jeanish
than Clyde Fitch is in his play. Butâ
and hei;e comes the difference and the
reason why some 2000 intelligent play
goers gave warrh attention to "The
Moth and the Flame" last nightâ Mr.
Fitch has set these yeliow-back situa
tions to an accompaniment of keen,
smart, American humor. His absurdly
serious characters are countered by
others that axe candidly flippant, im
pertinent and cynical. These latter con
tribute an almost constant run of spry
comment and raillery. They forestall
you in the gentle business of jeers and
sarcastic laughter. In fact, Mr. Fitch
has written a little audience of his own
that saves the one out in the audi
torium a lot of trouble and gives it a
lot of merriment. A very ingenious bit
of playwriting.
So I will not venture to take Mr.
Fitch's seriousness too seriously. The
villain, who starts out to be
the very plausible smoothy that
you would call by another
name, soon blossoms out in the
regular conventional colors of malevo
lence. After the pugilistic episode in
the church he still pursues the girl and
threatens her with the secret of her re
cently suicided father's defalcations;
and when this matter is congenially
baffled he sadly leaves for Europe, first
giving his name to the woman whom he
has betrayed and their child. It would !
be too much to ask Mr. Kelcey, or any j
other actor whose personality is a pop- '
ular fixture, to forego some sort of an !
amicable compromise at the end; and
anyway this bit of reparation is quite J
in keeping 1 with the suddennesses that
have preceded it. Indeeed, this ending
is a gem when you think how much
worse Mr. Fitch might have done. He
might have reformed Mr. Kelcey en
tirely at the twelfth hour and given
him Miss Shannon's hand anl forgive
ness. In the present arrangement she
does not need it, for the impulsive
youth whose love and warning she had
scorned in the earlier scenes is confi
dently ready and waiting as the last
curtainfalls^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And this is not the only forbearance
on the part of the author. He has not
clothed the Injured lady in black al
paca; and she does not speak of the
fruits of her love as "me-cheild"; and
the youngster does not invade the altar
crying "Popper!"
The comedy part is really admirable.
At times you are reminded in a modest
way of Oscar Wilde. The lines glitter
like bright tin pans. There is a cer
tain modern social swing in the talk at
the ball (adults in children's costume â
very droll conceit after the mode of
Pinero) at the interrupted wedding, and
in fact, in the last act, too. In the
lighter characters epigrammatic imper
tinence is given full swing and many
of the sallies are memorable. The most
of the wit-work falls to a Mrs. Lorri
mer, twice married and divorced and
looking for more. Miss Marion Abbott
has this part, which Is quite the catchi
est in the play, and she makes it de
lightful with her large contralto hu
mor. She was easily the belle of the
party last night. Miss Leila Ellis has
another part in much the same vein,
which she handles successfully, and
Miss Winona Shannon gives contrast
The Power of Storm.
The Cayman Islands in the West Indies were
nearly overwhelmed by the recent storm. Even
apparently secure* things are not safe. 'Even

Miss Effle Shannon is not at her most
as the interrupted bride. The part re
quires either less legitimate effort or
more out-and-out melodrama. As it is
not in Miss Shannon's temperament to
give the latter, she would do better to
play with less obvious emotion. Her
rendition last night was neither one
thing nor the other. It was not strenu
ous enough for melodrama, and it was
tod artificially cadenced for the oppo
site qualities of repression and sugges
tion. 1 don't know just how to be just
to Mr. Kelcey. His part is very trying.
It is too inconsistent even for human
nature as we see it off the stage. It
has the making of an accomplished
villain early in the game, but it peters
out woefully as the piece advances.
Considering this, you must give the
actor credit for making as much out
of it as he does. I can think trf only
one improvement, and that would be
for Mr. Kelcey not to take the audience
into his confidence by means of know
ing winks. The lines themselves are
quite obvious enough for the densest o-f
us. It is a pity for Herbert Kelcey
ever to forget that in a certain line of
varnished parts he is one of the most
valuable men on the modern stage.

No better example of the versatility of
Reginald tie Koven and Harry B. Smith
can be found than in their latest produc
tion, "The Mandarin," on this week and
doubtless for another week at the Tivoli.
The introductory performance of this
comic opera was given last night and was
received with enthusiasm. A little nerv
ousness was manifested by the players
during the first act, but. on the raising of
the curtain on the second players and
audience alike became enthused and the
piece was well rounded out.
"The Mandarin" is a Chinese opera, al
though the general entanglement and
final unraveling of the plot plainly be
speaks the American author. The story
presents a Mandarin of Fuchau, China,
who has the misfortune to closely resem
ble the town vagabond. Fan Tan. Fan
Tan is the possessor of a beautiful wife,
to whom he is devoted; but frequently he
leaves his love for brawls that last for a
period of days. During one of these
brawls and his consequent absence from
home the Mandarin passes his humble
cottage, and being told of the beauty of

the vagabond's wife decides to woo and
win her, hut not to wed her, as he has
already his allotted number of wives,
twelve, and should he marry another he
would encroach upon the right of the
Emperor, who alone has thirteen in his
home circle, and would suffer the penalty
of his life. So the Mandarin disguises him
self as the vagabond and calls upon the
benuuful wife of his double, and she. be
lieving he is her husband, to his great
joy throws herself in his arms. She then
introduces him to the twins, and puts
an iced rag around his head. This is. all
very pleasant for him, but unfortunately
his valet leaves his royal robes lying
around, and Fan Tan. when he returns
home, gets into them, is discovered thusly
by the Mandarin's guardian and to his
great disgust is carried away to the pal
ace to be caressed by the Mandarin's'
twelve wives and score of children. In
the meantime the Mandarin has been ar
rested and cast into prison for the vaga
bond's sins, and his wife in searching, for
him finds herself in the palace, where she
announces herself as his wife. This brands
him as the proprietor of thirteen wives.
and as the Emperor is informed of his
crime by a lover of one of the twelve, he
is cast into prison to await his fate. The
Mandarin has also become as seriously
entangled and as both are about to be
beheaded a fourteenth wife of the Em
peror is discovered and he is called upon
to prosecute himself for treason. As this
would mean the death of himself he par
dons all hands and "all live happily ever
afterward." . _.

TO AID CALIFORNIA CLUB
MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION IN
ANNUAL SESSION.
â¦ â
Elects a New Board of Directors and
Gives Further Evidence of Its
Appreciation of the City's
Needs.
The Merchants' Association met in an
nual session in Academy of Sciences Hall
last night for the purpose of electing a
hoard of directors for the ensuing year ,
and receiving the annual report of the
retiring hoard. Incidentally the associa
tion devoted a large portion of the eve
ning to a discussion of the subject of .
children's public playgrounds, the estab
lishment of which is being strongly ad
vocated by the ladies of the California
Club. A large delegation from that or- !
ganization was] present by invitation and
they presented their rap.- so eloquently
that the support of the association was 'â 
pledged and President ihrman was In
structed to appoint a committee of five j
to meet with the department of educa- |
tion of the club for the purpose of fur- i
* *" f) laiii â t&t â VgtiV' â  I
thering the project.
. According to the directors' port, which
was read by Secretary J. Richard Freud, !
the association, which was organized five j
years ago with a charter membership of
forty-seven, now boasts of a membership
of 1057 and a surplus of J::7::i 41. The re
port refers with pride to the work accom- !
plished by the association during the past '
year and particularly to the progress
of the movement to secure the repave
ment of the streets in the central portion j
of the city and to its efforts in connection i
with the framing of the new charter. Mu
nicipal ownership of a lighting plant is
advocated, as is the perfection of a sci
entific sewerage system. In conclusion
the report announces that in connection
with the question of the next tax levy
with which the association is at present
occupied, a future municipal plan for the
economic management of the city's affairs
and at the me time make possible
many projected improvements, is being i
formulated which will be submitted to ail
the political parties for their endorse
ment.
The. following board of directors, rec
omended by the Dominating committee,
was adopted unanimously: A. S. Baldwin, |
Wallace Bradford. Charles Bundschu, An- ,
drew M. Davis, F. W. Dohrmann, Joseph
D. Grant, Marshal Hale, Hugo D. Keil,
Daniel V. Kelly, Edward B. Pond, John !
E. yuinn, Hugo Rothschild, W. R. Sher
wood, Frank J. Symmes an.l Rolla V. :
Watt.
President Dohrmann then introduced
Mrs. A. D. Sharon, chairman of the de
partment of education of the California
Club, as the first speaker, on the subject
of public playgrounds for the children of
the city. .Mrs. Sharon made an eloquent
plea for the little folks and aroused great
enthusiasm by the vivid picture she drew
of the evil consequences of the neglect
to which the youth of the city are sub
jected and the dangers and temptations
with which they are daily beset by being
compelled t<> pass all their leisure hours
on the streets, subject to no restraining
influence?. She declared that much of the '
evil and lawlessness among the city pop- I
ulation was directly traceable to the
seeming indifference of the people gener- i
ally to the physical and moral welfare of
their offspring. In effect, she said the i
street was a hool of crime, where the 1
natural tendencies of the child were per
verted and criminal habits fostered and
developed. She then sketched the history
of the movement for the establishment of i
children s public playgrounds, which was !
inaugurated in this country about eleven 1
years ago at Boston, and proceeded to il- \
lustrate the great benefit:- which have re- 'â 
sulted in every city where the play- !
grounds are maintained. Philadelphia. >
New York. Brooklyn, Chicago and nearly
all the large cities in the East had emu
lated the example of Boston, or were pre- i
paring to do so, and the results every
where are shown in a wonderful decrease ;
in the number of juvenile offenders :
against the laws. Her remark that pub- i
lie playgrounds were more economical i
than jails was loudly applauded. In con
clusion Mrs. Sharon told â¢â â¢ the experi
mental playground recently established
by the club on Bush street, near i ESS?
the success of which had already been
satisfactorily demonstrated and she an
pealed to the association to assist the club
;n establishing a playground south of
Mark' J stre< â¢
Dr. Dorothea Moore, chairman of the
civic department, followed with a brief
address along the same lines, and de- :
scribed the working of the plan in opera- :
tion n Chicago, where she resided before
locating in this city. Short addresses were
also made by President Mrs. Loveil
nh L te^ H rs V A ' L ' Mann .and Mrs. Krebs
on behalf of the club. reos
D. V Kelly championed the cause of
the club and quoted statistics to show thÂ«
necessity for some such reform In the
methods of training the future citizens of'
the city. He said the report of 'the Chief
of Police for the year just ended showed i
that W)0 children had been arrested in
this city in twelve months, 10 per cent of :
all arrests other than those directly trace- '
able to drunkenness. In New York the
number of arrests of boys under 16 yearÂ«
for a similar period was 14,000.
"Wherever playgrounds have been es
tablished." said the speaker, "the decrease :
In the arrests of children has amounted to
30 per cent. In Boston $200,000 is annually
spent In the. maintenance of public play
grounds for the children ana it is con
sidered exceedingly well spent."
Mr. Kelly thought San Francisco should
he well provided in this respect in view of !
the number of parks and vacant lots in i
the city which are at present bring put to I
Â»b*olutrly no use. A. S. Baldwin thought |
th<* association should pledge itself to
provide the playgrounds asked for south
of Market street, Other directors were of
the same opinion. It was admitted that
in view of the state of the city's finances j
th^re was but little chance of securing
aid from the Board of Supervisors, and
finally on motion of Director Bundschu a
resolution was adopted pledging the as
sistance of the. association to the club
and directing the president to appoint a
committee of five to confer on the sub
ject with the department of education
repreenting the club. The joint commit
tee will meet in the club rooms in the Y.

THE GRAIN SCHEDULE
IS NOT RESCINDED
Blunder Committed by Lawyer Herrin,
Blackstock and Laumeister De
feats the Railroad
Scheme.
SOME one connected with the law
department of the Southern Pa
cific has blundered, and the blun
der places Commissioners Black
st"fk and Laumeister in a sorry
plight These Commissioners, in their
hast*' to obey the commands of \V. F.
Herrin. did not inform themselves of
the fact that the preceding Board of
Railroad Commissioners not only
adopted a series of resolutions reducing
rates, but in order to make the reduc
tion effective subsequently framed and
adopted a schedule of rates. Lau
meister and Blackstock. on May 9,
voted to rescind the resolutions
adopted by the old Board of Commis
sioners on September 14, 1595, but did
not rescind or suspend the schedule of
reduction which the board adopted on
September 16. 1895. in order to make the
resolutions effective.
The injunction against the eight per
'â¢ nt grain reduction has been dis
missed by request" of the Southern Pa
cific Company, and the grain schedule
adopted by the old Board stands as it
stood on the day that the Southern Pa
cific Company received the twenty
days' notice of its adoption.
Following is a copy of the Blackstock
rescinding resolution adopted by the
present Board of Railroad Commis
sioners on May 10. 1899:
Whereas, On the 9th day of May,
IW. the Railroad Commission "f the
State of California passed and adopted
a resolution amending a resolution
by said board passed and adopted
April 24, 1599, repealing and rescinding
the resolutions adopted by said board
on the 13th and 14th days of Septem
ber, lS9n. providing for a reduction of
grain rates, etc.. and
Whereas. The board is of the opinion
that the case now pending in the Cir
cuit Court of the United States known
as the 'grain rate" case should be set
tled and the injunction against the
board be dissolved: but that the same
shall be done without further cost to
the State;
It is now therefore ordered and re
solved, that the Attorn-- General "f
the State of California be am! hereby
is instructed to secure a dismissal of
said case as soon as such dimissal can
be obtained, and upon the conditions
as to costs as herein indicated.
The resolution was adopted by the
votes of Blackstock and Laumeister,
Edson voting in the negative.

Cruiser Hiyei Anchors

+
The Japanese training ship Hiyei ar
rived from Puget Sound yesterday. This
â¢ is her second visit to this port with boys
and men learning the business of war.
About four years ago she came here from
Hawaii and after remaining in port a
month. proceeded north. On this occasion
she went direct to the Sound from Yoko
hama and from here will 'go to Honolulu.
The Hiyei is a composite vessel and be

blunder there will be music in the yel
low building. The excuse that Railroad
Commissioners Laumelster and Black
stock adopted the rescinding order will
not go down. These Commissioners
went to Herrin's house to rehearse,
I and the head of the law department
should have taught them that the grain
schedule of September 25th should have
been revoked. How Herrln and his as
sistants happened to overlook the im
portant part of their work cannot be
explained at this time. Referring to
The Call of September 15, 1595, the fol
lowing is found among the general
resolutions providing for the reduc
tion:
Resolved, That this board proceed at
its earliest convenience to adopt a re
vised schedule of rates in accordance
herewith, in order that the same may
be in force on or before January 1,
l^9iÂ» . and be it further
Resolved, That if the necessities of
the case so require this board will at
once proceed to the ascertainment of
the proportion of reduction due any
commodity which by reason of its na
ture requires to be moved between
now and the date herein fixed of the
taking effect of said general reduction.
The Call of October 9, 1895, respond
ing to the public demand for informa
tion regarding the reduction, made this
statement:
"The printed copy of the reduced
grain rate was served on the company
September 26, and therefore the new
rate does not go into effect until Oc
tober 16. The twenty days' notice be
gins to run only after a printed copy
of the schedule has been served on the
company."
The foregoing information was avail
able, Uut the Southern Pacific lawyers
and the two Southern Pacific commis
sioners were soanxious to undo the work
of the former board that they struck
at the first thing in sight.
Robert Y. Hayne, in his argument be
fore the United States Circuit Court,
clearly cited the distinction betweeen
the general resolutions and the sched
ule. This is tht- language used:
"So there is a provision that the
rates do not take effect until the twen
tieth day after the service of the
schedule, and that, of course, presup
poses that a schedule has been made.
But as to grain rates, there has been a
service of the schedule. As to the other
25 per cent reduction, the board has not

five days to come down here from Ta

Captain Nakayama is in command of
the Hiyei and has under him 15 officers,
58 midshipmen and 250 men. She will re

of the officers came ashore yesterday.
They are a fine looking lot of men and

' The' British ship G. W. Wolff had a ter
rible time of it off the Horn during the
voyoge from Puget Sound to Cork. She
left Tacoma on December 24 with 57,154
centals of wheat valued at $55,250, shipped
by Gibson & Kerr. She arrived at Cork
on May 12 and was ordered to Antwerp.
The latter port was reached yesterday
and then the Dews of her troubles was tel
egraphed to. the Merchants' Exchange
here. Captain Barker says that the 1
weather was something unusual even for
the "Cape of Storms." The wind blow
with hurricane force and the G. W. Wolff
was thrown on her beam ends. The oar
go shifted, sails were blown out of the
bolt ropps, th.> cabin doors were smashed
in and the cabin tin >Â«]od ; the deckhouses
were damaged and the men's belongings
washed out of them: the hatch covers and
all things movable on deck were washed
overboard and when a sounding could be
made there was 10 feet of water in the
hold. The Wolff weathered the storm and i
reached Cork in the fair time of 139 days.
Both Captain Barker and his ship are
well known in San Francisco. %
The steamer Roanoke will sail for Pug.M
Sound to enter the Klondike trade in a
few days. Captain Kidston and Chief Of
ficer "Ferguson, who commanded the yes- !
sol when she was a transpo" " â¢â ; .will go to
Norton Sound, on hep as passe: kers. Cap
tain Weaver and <'hijf Officer Spiers, late |
of the Valencia, will :'ake the vessel out. .;
Chief Steward Schubert will look after
the commissariat of the Roanoke. It was {
originally the intention 1 to run the- Roan- j
oke between Seattle and Dyea, but now
yet made any schedule. The conse
quence is that the 25 per cent reduction
has not yet gone into effect. As to
that, the action is entirely future. In
that regard the bill alleges as follows:
That, pursuant to said resolution,
said defendants have prepared sched
ules of grain rates in accordance
therewith, and on the L'6th day of Sep
tember. 1895, served the same upon
your orator, and are proceeding to pre
pare schedules of rates upon all other
classes of freight, in accordance with
said resolutions, and threaten to and
will at the earliest possible period, and
not later than January 1. 1896, unless
restrained by this honorable court, put
the same into force and effect, and will
attempt to compel your orator to
comply therewith.
"So that, according to the aver
ments of the bill, the service has been
made upon the complainant of the
schedules in relation to grain rates."
It is the judgment of lawyers that
the grain reduction schedule was not
disturbed by the adoption of the Black
stock resolutions. W. W. Foote and
Robert Y. Hayne entertain the opinion
that the grain schedule was not re
scinded by the Blackstock resolutions
and was not affected by the order of
the court dismissing the case. They
maintain that the schedule is now in
existence.
Last night this question was ad
dressed to Tirey L. Ford, Attorney Gen
eral: "Is me grain rate schedule of
the old board still in force?"
He replied: "This is a question that
has suddenly presented itself, and I
have not had time yet to examine it.
The question of costs is engaging my
attention just now and must first be
considered. Furthermore, the question
you ask is one that Is likely to reach
me officially through the Railroad Com
mission, and it would scarcely be
proper for me to express an opinion
thereon in advance."
It is surmised that ex-Railroad Com
missioner La Rue was the first man to
discover that Laumeister and Black
stock had made a mess of the repealing
job. The news reached the law depart
ment of the Southern Pacific yesterday.
C. P. Huntington may adopt extreme
measures, requiring Laumeister and
Blackstock to vote for a supplementary
resolution rescinding the grain rate
schedule.

INSTALLATION
The Ceremony Was a
Public One.
BEFORE BRILLIANT AUDIENCE
SWELLEST MASONIC EVENT OF
THE YEAR.
Reception to the Grand Master of
the Grand Encampment and
Grand Commander of
California.
The elected and appointed officers of
Golden Gate Commandery, Knights Tem
plar, were publicly installed in the main j
assembly hall of Golden Gate Asylum last
night.
For the occasion the hall was profusely
and most artistically decorated with bunt
ing, ferns and palms, while on the stage
were draped the emblematic colors of the
Knights, and at the station of the emi
nent commander in the east were the
American flag and the Beauseant, while
overhead was the red passion cross, and
which, being transparent, its brightness
was made apparent by the light burning
behind it. A very large red passion cross
rested on a field of silver lilies at the back
of the eminent commander's station. The
main body of the hall was occupied by the
Sir Knights of the commandery, in their
beautiful and attractive uniforms, and
each wore his white-plumed chapeau.
Back of these were a large number of la
dies and gentlemen, who filled every
I available bit of space, many standing
against the side walls. In the gallery
every seat was occupied, and there were
so many ladies in full dress that one was
reminded of a first night at the opera.
The stage was occupied by Most Eminent
end Grand Master of the Grand Encamp
ment of the United States R. H. Lloyd,
Past Grand Commander George D. Met
calfe", Charles E. Hyde, deputy grand
commander of the State of New York, and
: a number of high dignitaries of the order.
I The installing officer was the Right Em
| inent Sir John F. Merrill, who was as
sisted by Eminent Sir Jonathan M. Peel
as marshal.. The music incident to the
imposing ceremonies of the evening was
under the direction of Sir Samuel D.
Mayer and Frank Coffin, C. L. Gage and
Sir Knights J. R. Jones and W. C. Camp
bell. The captain general, Sir Harry D.
Loveland. and Junior Warden Sir Robert
W. Campbell being out of the city, and
Sir Herman J. Sadler, treasurer, and Sir
Thomas Kirkpatrick, standard bearer, be
ing ill, were not installed.
The following was the order of . exer

; orchestra: prayer, prelate; "The Lord's Pray
er," choir; Installation of eminent commander;

Then came the proclamation made to
i the East, the North, the South and the
I West, after which the deputy grand com
mander of the Stale of New York was
i presented and he made a few appropriate
remarks. This was followed by the pre
; sentation by Sir Knight J. M. Gassaway,
past grand commander of the District of
Columbia and worthy matron of Ivy Chap
ter of the Order of the Eastern Star, to E.
Sir Knight Charles 1.. Patton, the retiring
commander, of a magnificent jewel, con
sisting of the red passion cross, at the
jointure of which is a valuable solitaire
set in a sunburst of gold. Sir Knight
Gassaway then on Dehalf of the com
mandery presented to Mrs. C. L. Patton,
who is a prominent member of the Gold
en Gate Club, composed of the wives of
Sir Knights of the commandery, a snow
white case in which there was a silver
berry Bet, the bowl oeing rilled with red
and white roses, the offering being like
that to the retiring commander, an offer
ing of the love of the knights for the re
cipients on account of their zeal for the
commandery.
This was followed by a musicale, dur
ing which the following numbers were pre
sented: "Soldier's Song," C. L. Gage; "A
Song of Sunshine," Miss 1,. C. Sneider;
cornet solo, J. Bromberger; "Farewell,"
Frank Coffin; "Sunshine and Rain," W. i
C. Campbell; "The Star-spangled Ban
ner," by the orchestra. As a finale to the
exercises in the ball there was in one of
the parlors a reception to the M. E. R. H.
Lloyd, grand master of the Grand En
campment, and to R. E. Sir John F. Mer
rill, grand commander of the Grand Com
mandery of California.

his manager. "Billy" Madden, will put
in an appearance to-day.
Kennedy has been taking considerable
exercise for sonic weeks preparatory to
a course of training which will put "him
in Rrst-Class fettle for what he expects
will be a hot argument. Ruhlin is con
sidered a clever heavy-weight who has
had trials with Jeffries. Maher and other
men who are now looked upon as being
among the best men of the heavy-weight
class of pugilists. Kennedy's only con
test of note was a 20-round bout with
"Jack" Stelzner, but his performance
was so good that his friends considered
him competent to meet the best man at
the game excepting Fitzsimmons or
Sharkey, and Ruhlin was selected as first
choice." The fight will determine the fu
ture of the local man. If Kennedy can
defeat Ruhlin he will be a candidate for
championship honors.

What Miss Lucy A. Heiser, a trained
nurse of eight years' experience and a
graduate of the Homeopathic Hospital
of Minneapolis, Minn., hero says of
Paine's celery compound vitally con-
cerns every suffering woman:
"I am glad to testify to the merits of
Paine's celery compound especially as
a tonic in cases of convalescence. I
have noticed very satisfactory results
with patients under my care when
Paine's celery compound was pre-
scribed."
The above indorsement is corrobo-
rated by the experience of Mrs. Hasei-
ton:
"We have been using your Paine's
celery compound in the Xazarene
Home for some months, and it is with
great pleasure that I can say that our
aged people have invariably been bene-
fited by Its use. I have been using it
myself, as has also my niece, and there
has been a marked improvement in our
health. I was very much run-down
after the winter's hard work, but am
feeling very much better. I have rec-
ommended it to a number of friends
outside of the Home, and they, too,
have been greatly pleased with the re-
sults. We shall never be without it in
the Home." Mrs. M. A. Haselton. Man-

Mrs. Chandler, President of the So-

Chicago, 111., says:
"Too constant application to work

At such times Paine's celery compound

place." Lucinda B. Chandler.

FENDERLESS STREET CARS
THF. fatal accident of Sunday in which the life of
a chi rushed out by a car on Third
street adds another name to the rapidly increas
leath list o; the fenderless care, and renews the
warning that until the city compels the car companies
".ip their cars with proper lenders they will do
nothing of value in that direction.
It i- not necessary to raise any sensational cry of
"murder" against the car company over the accident
nder its lesson impressive. The effect of the
death of the little child is more potent than any effect
yellow journalism may produce by coarse, harsh
words, or by grotesque cartoons. The story of the
manner in which the death was caused, when told
with the utmost simplicity, is sufficient to rouse pub
lic sentiment on the subject, and if it do not move the
rvisors to act with promptness and resolution in
ting a stringent fender ordinance, there must be
something in the moral and intellectual make-up of
an official personage which is widely different from
â¢ l â¢ if the normal man.
For years the people of San Francisco have been
endeavoring to bring about the enactment and the en
forcement of some adequate ordinance of the kind.
Time and again there has been an outburst of popu
lar indignation which has compelled the Supervisors
to make what was at least a vigorous pretense at ac
tion on the subject. On each of these occasions,
however, there has been one excuse after another put
forward by the company, and the adoption of a fender
lias been delayed and delayed until public attention
was directed to some other issue, and then the whole
matter was dropped.
From the present Board of Supervisors much may
be expected. It has given promise of good work,
and here is an opportunity for it to show itself worthy
of the best hopes the people entertain of it. The fender
question has been so long debated and so frequently
investigated that the board ought to have in its
records sufficient data on which to base a well con
sidered and judicious fender ordinance. No good rea
son can be assigned for any long postponement of ac
tion. The whole subject has been gone over again and
again, and it is just as possible to adopt a proper fen
der and order its use by the street car companies now
as a year hence.
The people do not expect impossibilities; they do
not demand an ordinance which will go beyond what
is just and right. They do expect, however, that
Â«<",rnething will be done to prevent these fatal acci
dents, which have now become altogether too fre
quent on our streets. The death list of the fenderless
ears is becoming appallingly large. We call them
'fenderless" because that is what they virtually are.
The so-called "fender" with which they are equipped
<.f no life-saving or limb-protecting value. It
serves only as an excuse for not adopting a genuine
fender. It presents a seeming compliance with law
and respect for the safety of passers along the streets,
but beyond that is of no service whatever. It is not
impossible to devise a genuine safety appliance and to
require its attachment to all cars, and that is what the
public now demands of the Supervisors.
English newspapers are criticizing President McKin
ley for his refusal to wear golf clothes. "Is a game
that is dignified enough for the Prince of- Wales,"
they say, "not sufficiently so for the President of the
United States?" There is a suspicion that the Prince
of Wales has taken a part in some games which peo
ple very much humbler in station than President Mc-
Kinley would not care to emulate.

As Admiral Dewey started on his triumphal home
ward journey the guns of the forts of Cavite boomed
forth a noisy salute in generous parting to the great
sailor. The welcome which the same guns belched
forth a year and a few days ago to the Admiral was
quite as noisy and not by any means as generous.

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.
Ill; VERY outgiving from the Peace Conference at
The Hague strengthens the view that there, as
J â â  on the field intended to be covered by the con
ference, it is England and the United States com
bined and the other nations against them.
This country and Great Britain tried successfully
i the first great experiment at arbitration and both
I abided by the verdict.
When the Venezuela boundary question, after de
cades of incubation, seemed about to hatch a war be
tween an American and a European state, in which
the stronger might assert the right of conquest in
defiance of the Monroe doctrine. President Cleveland
asserted the rights of the United States in the issue
and gave to that doctrine its first definite interpreta
tion. England yidded and submitted to arbitration,
and the court chosen will soon sit and hear the case.
When England yielded to President Cleveland's de
mands she was berated in every Continental country.
They all exhibited objections to the principle of ar
bitration, and intense hostility to England because
she had receded, and to the United States because her
recession added to our prestige. When the Spanish
war came on the Continental nations, misreading the
policy of England, expected her to make a reprisal on
the United States by joining a European concert in
favor of Spain. But English diplomacy proved to be
past finding out by the rulers of the Continent. She
stood aloof from an anti-American concert, and by
standing there held the rest of Europe off our backs.
This was truly taken as a sign that England either
values an American alliance above all others, or that,
being isolated by the policy of the Continental na
tions, she has no other choice than concert with this
country. That they fear this result is evident, and
that they are taking the best means to bring it about
is also evident. The tireless and subtle flatter}' toward
the United States employed by all classes in England
has had its effect, and the American people are in a
complacent and compliant mood toward the most ex
treme proposition for an English alliance.
If the other powers were wise in the means chosen
to carry out their desire to prevent this substantial
union of the two countries, they would pursue a dif
ferent course in the Peace Conference and in their
diplomacy outside. They make the mistake of ad
mitting that England has sentiment in the matter, and
that her motive is altruistic. Conceding that this
country is not in shape to plead altruism in purpose,
it is as well to understand that England is without any
sentiment beyond self-interest and self-preservation.
While it is true that she prevented a Continental con
cert against us in the Spanish war. it is equally true
that she surrendered to arbitration of the Venezuela
boundary only because refusal meant war with the I
United States and a European concert against her !
that would have been destructive. The fear of such
concert compelled her to make a surrender for which ,
she was hooted by the nations that would have
jumped at her throat if she had not surrendered.
Out of all this issues the situation in the Peace
Conference The strong nations met there are not
moved by any other than the motives of ambition and i
self-interest. De Stria! may talk high sentiment and
eulogize the figure of Peace closing the temple of
Janus, and Pauncefote may talk warmly of peace as
the normal state of nations, but all this is the senti
i/iental ambush of the deliberate purpose of the na
tions to not yield an inch of present position or pros- !
pective advantage. If arbitration come it will not be I
by general agreement, but will depend upon joint ac
tion between the two countries which feel that by ar
bitrating their own differences they will gain some
thing out of the differences of others.
These countries are England and the United States.
An arbitration agreement between them is the equi
valent of a declaration of war against the rest of the
world. England saved herself in 1688, whe.i William
111 placed her at the head of the European alliance
against Louis XIV, and again when she led Europe
against Bonaparte. But the close of each of those
alliances left the rest of Europe in an inquiring mind
as to any benefit secured by any nation except Great
Britain. Out of that condition has come about Eng
lish isolation and her compulsory favor for the
United States.
There are Americans who could wish that this coun
try, while accepting the situation, would do so with
more show of self-respect. The proposition to send
American soldiers to parade in London is one of the
symptoms of the condition that has so early become
apparent in the Peace Conference. England is per
fectly well aware that such an exhibition will be taken
by the rest of Europe as evidence of her practical
suzerainty of the United States. It will exalt her
power, but will humiliate us in the eyes of every
European friend of republican institutions. What
ever comes, and out of the stress of our anomalous
position and longing for the gewgaws of imperialism
much may come, this Government should let Ameri
cans retain sufficient self-respect to refuse to permit
themselves to be looked upon as the modern Hessians
of Great Britain.
TRUSTS AND PRICES.
HON. JAMES W. LEE of Pittsburgh in a re
cent discussion of trusts before the Industrial
Commission, stated it as an indisputable fact
that the object of such combinations is to raise prices,
and that they attempt to do so by establishing as far
as possible a monopoly of the articles the combina
tion is engaged in producing or marketing.
While Mr. Lee made the statement as attorney for
companies which are in competition with the Stan
dard Oil Company, and was arguing of course in the
interests of his clients, it is altogether likely he was
quite sincere in what he said. It is certain he gave
expression to what is the prevailing opinion of the
public on the subject. It is therefore interesting to
note that managers of trusts, who have had large
experience in the business, assert with positiveness
that while a good many combinations have been
formed with the aim of monopolizing production and
raising prices, all such efforts have resulted in failure,
however successful they may have been for a time.
One of these authorities, General John McNulta of
Chicago, receiver of the Cattle-feeding Company,
commonly known as the original Whisky Trust, is
quoted as having stated, as the conclusion of his study
of the books, papers and general history of that noted
organization, that its failure was due to the very fact
that it endeavored to raise prices and maintain them
at a point higher than they had been before the trust
was formed.
According to the report of his statement, he lays it
down as a general proposition that when a combina
tion of corporations undertake to monoplize produc
tion in a given line of industry, requiring no vast
amount of capital, the combination can succeed only
by reducing the selling price of the article to a level
at which competition is unprofitable for smaller es
tablishments. If prices be increased a stimulus is
given for new competitors to arise, and if the first of
these be bought up. the very capital paid for them is
used ofttimes in starting new ones..
Commenting upon the theory of General McNulta,
the New York Mail and Express points out that
whether it be sound or unsound as an economic prin
TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 23, 1899.
ciple, it finds a basis of support in the history of
American trade. "The oil monopoly and the sugar
monopoly have almost invariably followed the only
policy under which success was possible â namely, by
reducing the selling price of their commodities to a
level where competition became difficult and unprofit
able to those engaged in it. What the result would
have been had either or both of these great corpora
tions followed the opposite course and tried to de-Â«
stroy competition and increase prices at the same time
can readily be imagined. At one point or another
that policy would have been a complete and costly
failure."
It is worth noting, moreover, that the ability of
large combinations to undersell their competitors has
been due almost wholly to the economic advantage of
large plants over smaller ones. In no instance we can
recall has there been anything accomplished by the
trusts in the way of reduction of wages. It appears,
therefore, that while the statement of Mr. Lee is
seemingly correct, it expresses what is really a fallacy,
and that the only way by which a trust can be suc
cessfully managed is by reducing prices rather than
raising them.
THREATENED MONGOLIAN INVASION
WHEN the same interests that are. now blatantly
advocating American expansion in Asia were
in full cry for the abandonment of the Monroe
doctrine and the acquisition of Hawaii, The Qill
warned the people of the United States, and especially
our citizens on the Pacific Coast, that a covert and in
sidious attempt to deluge the country with cheap
Asiatic laborers was behind the movement and that
the exclusion laws were in danger.
Aside from the speeches of Mr. Huntington during j
his annual visit to San Francisco, signs from every
direction point toward the fulfillment of our predic
tions. Not long ago it was widely published that Act- !
ing Secretary of War Meiklejohn had declared that
the application of the immigration laws to Cuba and
Porto Rico by executive order did not extend the
exclusion laws to those islands, and of course the
same rule was applicable to Hawaii.
Why Cuba was placed in the same category with
Porto Rico, in the face of the proclamation under j
which the war with Spain was declared and prose- J
cuted, it is difficult to conceive. A local organ of the
railroad has furnished reasons which would be an ex
planation if they were true and did not constitute a
foul libel against the present administration. That
paper asserts in the most positive manner that our
promise to free Cuba from the Spanish yoke and en
able its population to set up an independent govern
ment was a deliberate falsehood, although officially
communicated to every great power upon the globe:
that the United States was actuated by no such hu
manitarian motive; candor exacts the acknowl- j
, edgment that, from the beginning of the trouble with
\ Spain, it was our intention to annex the "gem of the j
Antilles," and that, having once grasped that deso
lated island with our national tentacles, we will never
let go. The same proposition is applied to the Phil
; ippines. although in that archipelago the conditions
: are different. Another paper, which looked away
: from the railroad, while it rowed toward it with Dan
Burns in its boat, declares that the Federal Govern
ment has informed the imperial combination now
threatening to subject China to the fate of Poland
i that it will not quietly acquiesce in the partition "un
less the interests of this country are fully protected."
This pronunciamento, which is probably a mere in
vention, would mean that we are not satisfied with
; Porto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Hawaii, but
that we are determined to acquire more Asiatic terri
tory and become a confessed accomplice in imperial
istic robberies.
Doubtless in the constant flow of antagonism to
American institutions and American civilization there
is much chaff. The Government oHhe United States
has never yet officially announced the purposes with
which it is identified daily by the monopolistic and by
the yellow press. But the evidences of the inveterate
: design of the imperialistic expansionists, of whom
Mr. Huntington is a notable representative, to force
upon the country the cheap labor of unassimilating
Asiatics, alien in every respect to the American peo
ple, are rapidly multiplying. It is well known that in
this State the railroad has always resisted exclusion
! and flaunted its Chinese employes in the face of
indignant communities. The same policy, with
Japanese substituted for Chinese, has been con
spicuously and recently manifested on the lines of the
i Northern Pacific. Joshua K. Brown, the Federal In
\ spector of Chinese at the Hawaiian Islands, claims
that since annexation was proclaimed 12,180 Japanese
laborers have been admitted to that territory, of whom
1 197 were free and the remainder bound to contract
service for three years. In this recent addition to our
acquisitions half the population is Asiatic, and the
proportion is constantly increasing. The "little brown
men" from Japan are becoming more and more in
evidence in San Francisco. They are to be seen in
cur principal hotels and on the public streets in
steadily augmenting numbers. Only a few days ago
j the Western Addition Improvement Club, composed,
j as we are informed, of 300 leading citizens, objected to
the fact that the Japanese were crowding white chil
; dren out of the public schools and demanded their
exclusion.
The expansionists are furnishing us with kindergar
ten lessons of an extremely suggestive quality. Our
anticipations are already justified. The Asiatic
I crusade has begun, or rather has been revived. We
v ill venture the further prediction, however, that they
will not overrun America as the Tartars spread them
selves over Russian Europe, even though Mr. Hun
tington may be willing to take the part of a diplo-
I matic and strategic Gengis Khan.
The Czar's Peace Conference has opened with a
' splendid prospect of a war among the national dele
gations. Russian representatives declare that Eng
land is playing the fox, and the English reply with the
: familiar story oPsour grapes. An impression is gain
j ing currency that the Czar's familiarity with nihilistic
I plots makes him smell a conspiracy even in talk of
: peace.
Dispatches from Washington declare that the Fili
pino rebels will be forced soon to choose between the
mountains and the sea. It may not be long before
Aguinaldo's soldiers will be forced to the alternative
of the devil or the deep sea.
The arrest of seven men on a charge of high trea
son by order of President Kruger is regarded by the
Transvaal press as "an unfortunate local incident." It
will be rather emphatically unfortunate for the pris
oners if the accusation be proved.
The city's bond expert sometimes manages to ar
rive at the conclusion, after some prisoner has es
caped on straw bonds, that the sureties are worthless.
The better way would be to determine the fact be
fore such bonds are accepted.
The great peace conference of the Russian Czar has
convened at The Hague. Meanwhile Italy. France,
Germany and Russia will continue to plot for the par
tition of China on a peace basis.

I in July
The Sherman has aboard 1400 men of the
Sixth Infantry and about 100 recruits.
They are in command of Colonel Edgar
R. Kellogg and are about as line a lot
jof men as have ever sailed from San
Francisco. With the exception of Com-
I panics C, D and I, the regiment arrived
j at Folsom street wharf early in the day
j and were at once marched aboard the
I transport. During the afternoon the
1 missing companies and the recruits were
brought around from the Presidio on the
quartermaster's steamer General Mc-
Dowell and were also put aboard.
It was almost impossible to keep the
soldiers on the wharf. In twos and
threes and sometimes in half-do&ens they
scaled the fence built by the Govern
mentp-nnd made their escape. They pa
tronized the saloons in the vicinity until
a corporals guard rounded them up and
put them aboard again. When it comes
to the Grant's turn to sail in a few days
the soldiers will not find it so easy to get
out for a last drink. Posts have been run
up over the feme and three rows of
I barbed wire are to be strung along them.

others had not a fourth of their fighting
strength. In all 180 men answered the
roll call before the Brsi fight. When the
war was bver and th( Kixih returned to

one of the Sixth will be left behind.
When the regiment came over from Oak
land. John Gusting of Company B had to
be taken to the Harbor Hospital. A cur
sory examination by Dr. Hopper showed
that he was suffering from typhoid fever
and the authorities at the Presidio were
at once notified. There was some delay
in removing the sick man. as Ousting was

MEMORIAL ! DAYâ Subscriber, City
The custom that led up to Decoration or
Memorial day had its origin in the South
ern States before the close of the War of
the Rebellion. Early in the spring of
each year the Southern women were! in
the habit of decorating the graves of
their dead soldiers with flowers, and an
unwritten law fixed May 30 as the day of
observance. - Similar ceremony was ob
served in the North, but without especial
unanimity. May 5. IS6B, General John A
Logan, then commander in chief of the
Grand Army of the Republic, issued an
ordÂ«r fixing May 30 of that year as the
day' for strewing the graves of dead sol
diers, and it 1 has- been the custom every
year since to observe that day. In many
of the States Memorial day is made a le
tul holiday.
CHINESE SLAVE
DEALERS WILL
FEEL THE LAW
They Will Get Orders
to Vacate.
MAYOR'S ATTORNEY AT WORK
IS DRAWING THE PAPERS TO FIT
THEIR CASE.
Vigilant Society Proposes to Get
After White Property Owners if
the Statute Is Further
Violated.
The movement Inaugurated by the Vigi
lant Society against the slave pens of
Chinatown Is going forward and gaining
adherents day by day. The secretary of
the organization for the suppression of
yellow vice has already received replies
from a number of clergymen of the city
announcing their pleasure at the prospect
of joining in the work. In addition* to
this, the Mayor is preparing to do his
share. He has requested his attorney, D.
C. Murphy, to draw up a form of notice
to keepers of such houses that will con
form to the provisions of the statute vio
lated and as soon as it is completed will
serve a copy on each* of the proprietors of
Chinese houses of ill fame.
Attorney Murphy will have finished his
work within a day or so, from which it is
inferred that the notices will be served
before the end of the week. The work of
service will be under the supervision of
the Chief of Police, to whom the Mayor
will turn over the notices. It will then
remain for the keepers to vacate their
premises or to suffer arrest at the expira
tion of the statutory time for removal.
That the members of the Bow Wah
Tong.all of whom are proprietors of slave
pens, will ignore the notices is expected.
They stand ready, as they have always
stood, to defy the law and take their
chances of victory by the well-worn
paths of corruption so familiar to Chi
nese feet. As of old. they expect to suc
ceed by tiring out the opposition. This
time, the Vigilants say, they are" reckon
ing without their host The members of
the newly formed society for the eradica
tion of the evils of Chinatown have
counted on such resistance and they are !
prepared to meet it on the flank. In
other words, they will attack the white
property owners, some of whom, it is
thought, would not care tn be dragged
into court there to admit that part of
their Incomes is derived from the dpgra<l
ation of female slaves. If the members
of the How Wah Tong refuse to move out
for the :irm of the criminal law, the Vigi
lants will invoke it against their white
landlord?. Warrants will be sworn out
against them under the same statute, and
they will be prosecuted to the full ex
tent of the law.
That the Vigilants are gaining recruits
to their cau=e is manifested in the many
letters received at their headquarters
every day. Among those received yester
day was this one:

CONVENTION TO MEET HERZ
THE PRINCIPAL WINE-MAKING
COUNTIES REPRESENTED.
Vineyardists Apparently Satisfied
With the Workings of the Asso
ciation During tha Five Years
of Its Existence.
From the deliberations of the director
ate of the California Winemakers' Asso
ciation yesterday it is evident, It will be^
continued in existence by the vineyardiste,
throughout the State. On Thursday of
next week delegates representing the four
great wine-making countiesâ Santa Clara,
Sonoma, Napa and Alamedaâ will meet in
convention at the Lick House.
This was determined upon at a special
meeting yesterday called to consider* a
petition signed by the vineyardists of
Santa Clara County. The petition follows:
The Honorable Bfard of Directors Califor
nia "Winemakers' (â orporationâ Gentlemen:
Santa Clara County being one of the large
wine ppniucinp counties of the State, it is
respectfully requested by the undersigned
winemakers and 'members of the <"alifornia
Winemakers 1 Corporation of said county,
that you call a meeting of all the members
Â: s.ii cofp< ration, immediately, t.i be held
in San Francisco, to indorse the results of
the corporation and its workings; its man
agement j n genera! by its able board of
directors, and to reorganize on the. present
basis, eliminating surh errors or making
such changes as experience has taupht will
be for the best interest of the winemakers
of the State.
After a general discussion it was deter
mined to postpone action on the petition
pending the forthcoming convention. The
consensus of opinion was that the asso
ciation would be continued. It was or
ganized five years ago by the representa
tive wine men of the State. They pool
the products of their vineyards, which
are handled by the association. This hÂ«s
been proved a surcess and it is expected
i that new contracts will be entered into
I at the convention covering five years. The
! work of the association is carried out by
' a board of directors chosen from among
i its members. At the meeting yesterday
: were the following officials: President
! Henry J. Cr^rku. Vice President P. C.

al.. No. 42. in the Superior Court of the State of Califor
nia, in and for the County of Yolo, which said latter
named case was finally dismissed and disposed of on the
23d day of January. 1893 825,000
December 5, 1899, by cash 52.000
$23,000
All of the foregoing services were performed under one general em
ployment, and no separate charges were made in the several cases.
Such is the itemized bill of General A.
'Ji Hart presented and filed as a part of
:he pleadings In his action against Dan
Â»i M. Hums, and this bill, notwithstand
ing the vast amount of labor its various
x- ms convey to the disinterested peruser,
ias heen settled by the colonel in a court
>: his own making, presided over by Rail
â oad Kfpresentative J. B. Wright, for the
mm of $1500. The bill in itself is a mas
erpiece, an itemized demand of which
; :â¢â  man on the credit end must be un
- inly proud. It Is said that even Burns
ljpreciates the shocking suggestiveness
>f the paperâ suggestive in that it por
;rays that the people at one time be
leved some one crooked, and made things
â¢attier tropical for that some one â and if
.he politician of Mexico had things to do
)\er again he would not call for an item
z.-.l demand. He would content himself
.vith generalities.
When Burns made a demand for the
temized bill he doubtless failed to an
:icipate the brilliancy with which a list
if the misdeeds;'or rather crimes, charged >
o him, in a few, a very few, days would
fppear on paper. When he thought Gen
â¢ral Harts suit was going to trialâ that
.vas before he discovered that he could j
â nanufacture a court, issue summons and
:oi c Hart inâ he made another bad
â jreak. â¢ He demanded a jury trial, this
iemand Wing made at no later date than
December 16 last, before Superior Court
lu'!g<: Dunne. Perhaps he was of the
Dpinion that he could more easily
aandle a jury than a Judge; no one
iccuses him of holding the opinion that I
ie ould impress "twelve good men and
:iuc"" that he was simply the exemplin
:ation of injured innocence, an honest
nan fallen victim to the wrath of a ma
.icious public, and his purse the goal of
= lawyer of usurious inclinations. But
;he case didn't go to trial. Wright of the
raiiroad was discovered and tht day and
:he thousands saved.
In order to gain a. fair idea of the labors
Df General Hart it is but necessary to
peruse the itemized bill, and when it is
considered that Burns was guilty on each
:ount It is manifest that the demand was
aot only reasonable but one far below
Lhat the "honest crook would have been
willing to pay when he found that, in-
Seed, he had been saved frum a term in
stripes. The complaint gives a better
idea of the labor required, the allega
tions on the first item being as follows:
Between the month of October, IS&4, and
the 20th day of January. ISS3, at the special
instance and request ct the defendant, life
plaintiff performed professional services for
the defendan* in two certain actions In the
Police Cuurt of the <ity of Sacramento,
county cl Sacramento and State of Cali
fornia, in which defendant wan charged
with the crime of embezzlement; also in
twelve certain actions in the Superior Court
of the county of Sacramento, j-tate afore
said, in each of which the defendant was
charged with the crime of embezzlement,
alleged to have beer, cemmitted by him in
the misappropriation of public funds coming
into his possession while ho was Secretary
of State of the State of California; also in
a civil action began in the Superior Court
of the State of California, in and for the
city and county of Ran Francisco, and sub
sequently transferred to the Superior Court
in and for the count] of Yolo, State afore
said, which later action was prosecuted by
the people of the State of California against
the defendant and hi official bondsmen to
recover the sum of $31,734 M of th" money
belonging to the State alleged to have been
received by the defendant while he was
Secretary of State of the State of California
and to have bean misappropriated by him.
and also to recover -â 'â  per cent of said
amount in addition thereto at damagr?.
and also to recover Interest on said araoum
at the rate of 10 pec cent per annum froni
the loth day of November, ISM, which said
sums, [or which said action was prosecuted,
amounted. In the aggregate, at the time of
the commencement of this action, to more \
than $40,000.
On each of the following Hems the |
same allegations are made and as the ma- ;
jority of these charges were heard before
the superior Court, the work of the de
fense was even greater than the Initial
case, numbered on the Sacramento rec
ords, and as set forth on the bill, as
case 507. Burns was served with a copy
of the complaint and- then in the follow
ing terms made his denial to the allega
tions: regarding the first item:
On the 6th -day of October, ISM, an ac-
Itlon was besrun In the Police Court of the
city of Sacramento, County of Sacramento,
State of California, against this defendant,
in which action this defendant was charged
with the crime Of felony. That thereupon
the plaintiff herein voluntarily and gratu
t!ou3ly and without solicitation on the part
of defendant offered and tendered to this
defendant his. services as an attorney at
law in said action, and voluntarily and
frratuitoiisly and without solicitation on the
part of this defendant offered and under
took to appear for and represent this de
fendant In said action, and to do and per
form any and every act and thing In and
about the defense of said action as an at
torney at law on behalf of this defendant
necessary to be done and performed without
A POET'S MONUMENT
TO "THE PATHFINDER"
OAKLAND, May 22.â Joacpiin Millar is erecting a monument to the hero. <
General Fremont. The "Poet of the Sierras" says California has been -
Blow to honor "The Pathfinder." The monument will be located at "The (
HeightÃ." Miller's home, which was one of Fremont's camping Â«
places and is to stand in almost the identical spot where General Fre- (
mint stood many years ago and named the straits the "Golden Gate." The ,
monument is to be built of native blue rock, picked up In the vicinity and <
split into convenient size. The base la the spur of the rock, which projects -
from the hill. The upper pan is square and will be crowned with stones, *
built into battlements. The site is one of th*Â» most prominent points on Mil-
ler's property and affords a commanding view for many miles around the ,
bay. The monument will be completed in less than a month. (
cost or charge to this defendant of any j
kind or character whatsoever.
That this defendant accepted tue said vol
untary and eratultous offer of services of
plaintiff in mid action; that plaintiff under
and in pursuance of the saio. voluntary
offers of service and not otherwise did ap
pear for and represent this defendant In I
said action. That the said action never
came to trial: that thereafter an order was I
made to thÂ« Judge of Bald Police Court
continuing said iction Indefinitely: that
such order was equivalent to and in truth
and in fact operated to a dismissal in said
action and a discharge of the defendant in
said action. That thereupon said services
of plaintiff for and on behalf of this de
fendant in said action ceased and deter
mined; that plaintiff never rendered any
service or services in said action for or on
behalf of this defendant of any kind or
character whatsoever, except as herein
abov* tared, and that plaintiff has not
since that time rendered or performed any
service or services in or about said action
for or on behalf of this defendant of any
kind or character whatsoever.
A similar denial was made to each and
every allegation of the complaint regard-
Ing the manner in which the various j
items came to be on the bill. In one in- ;
stance Burns even relegated Hart to as
sistant counsel, claiming that the gen
eral simply came In, voluntarily and gra
tuitously, to assist Attorney F. E. Baker,
who had assumed the great undertaking
of keeping Daniel out of Jail. In conclu- ;
sion the colonel pays a tribute to his
generosity and his gratitude to Hart for
his untiring labors. He says:
On the sth day of December, M, this de
fendant voluntarily presented to the plain
tiff the sum of $2000 as a donation and a :
mark of gratitude and not otherwise. That
said sum of ?2<>Vi was at said time ac
cepted by the said plaintiff from the defend
ant as a d -.nation and mark of gratitude '
and not otherwise, and that the defendant
has never at any time or at all paid to the â 
plaintiff any sum or sums of money for or
on account of any services rendered r- the
plaintiff to or m behalf of this defendant
or for cr on account of any other thing:,
or at all.
Shortly after this last tribute to his
own gratitude and generosity was penned
and Burns was calculating upon the ef- j
feet to be produced thereby upon the
jury, he demanded, that justice
might be done him, J. B. Wright
of the railroad was discovered.
Wright mounted the bench builded â 
for him by the railroad candidate j
for the Senate and Hart was summoned j.
to appear. He did arid in a moment of j
trust or abandon the matter was sub- !
mitted to Wright for decision, and in j
time Wright announced the. verdict, and !
Hart was paid $1500 instead of 123,000, but i
he is now richer to the amount of the dif
ference in experience and valuable knowl
edge of the Mexican politician's code of j
honor.
HE WANTED TO BE JUST.
Alexander Boyd Gives Testimony in
His Own Behalf.
The action of Mrs. Belle Curtis and Liz- )
zie Muir to recover $30,000 from Alexander
Boyd. business partner of the late Jacob
Z. Davis, of whose estate the plaintiffs
are the heirs, was submitted yesterday
before Judge Belcher on briefs. When the
case was called yesterday Mr. Boyd again
took the stand to substantiate the claim i
that he was entitled to the $30,000 sued I
for as compensation for his services on \
behalf of his deceased partner's estate. j
Mr. Boyd said yesterday that while his j
partner was traveling and enjoying him- j
self hÂ». cared for the business. "I was at !
my office every day." he said, "and the
r.-:<snri ... T dirt not immediately rMvklo
death was that there was a great deal of
property to divide and I wanted to be just
to everybody; I wanted to be just to my
self. He further stated that he and his
partner oiten overdrew tneir account*, and .
no particular account was- kept of such
transactions, but In his opinion matters
stood about even at the time of Mr.
Davis death. This dlposed of the case as
far as the evidence was concerned, and
the matter was taken under advisement. :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 23, 1899.
"TIME" CALLED
TOO SOON
Lively Mix-Up Between Attorneys
Becsy and K^enmy in Front
of the City Prison.
THERE was a lively "mlxup" be
tween Attorney Becsy and Attor
ney Kenney, the "Salmon Alley
Politician," In front of the City
Prison last evening. When hostili
ties censed Kenney looked as if he had
run afoul of a kicking mule. His face
was cut and Weeding and his clothes were
almost torn from hip back. The men were
not arrested, notwithstanding that their
"little unpleasantness." as Kenney
termed it, occurred under the window of
the Central station, where at least twenty
policemen were congregated.
"It is this way," remarked Attorney
Kenney, as he attempted to force a re
calcitrant piece of skin back on his fore
head. "Becsy don't like me, and every
time I see him I want to do him. Are
you ;u-xt? Som^ time ago \vp had a scrap,
and I put it onto him. !!â¢â  has been sore
ever since, and my friends warned me to
be "ii the lookout, as he was determined
to get even.
"I was standing in front of the City
Prison, anxiously endeavoring to make an
honest dollar. " continued Kenney. In giv
ing his version of the "late unpleasant
ness." "when my deadly rival appeared.
We had seme words, and I started to
knock his block oft. I wish I hadn't now.
as 1 realize I got the worst of it. Just
as f smashed him he copped me one on
the jaw ami 1 dragged him down with me.
We wen struggling in the garden along
side of the Central station, when Attor
trchte Campbell shouted that the
poiice were coming, and we quit. 1 guess
it was a good thing for me, as Becsy had
nit- all but out.
E j . did you see the other guy?" asked
Kenney, tearing off a piece of bruised
fleph that hung from his upper lip. "He
must look like he had passed through a
s:it:s;>K f - mnchine."
When told that Becsy had escaped un
injured Kenney was angry, and In a sort
of stage whisper he declared he would
"gpt him" the next time they came.to
gether.
"Campbell is a bad actor." muttered
Kenney, realizing that his hated rival was
not 1n" hearing distance. "If he had not
called time I would have put it all over
that guy. Wait until we meet again!
His own mother won't recognize him
when I get through with him."
The hostile attorney then left the scene,
vowing vengeance against Becsy , and
"Referee" Campbell.
DICK HEISE IS
THE EAGLE KING
WINS THE SCHTJETZEN ANNUAL
SHOOT AT SHELL MOUND.
This Is the Second Time That the Ac
curate Marksman Has Succeeded
in Hitting the Magic
Spot.
The annual eagle shoot and May fes- |
tival of the San Francisco Soheutzen Ye- i
rein was brought to a close yesterday
afternoon at Shell Mound Park. The af
fair, which was the fortieth one held by
he verein, was perhaps the most enjoy
ble and successful of all the previous
vents. Fully a thousand people thronged
he grounds and made merry all day.
While' the members of the verein were out
on the racecourse making' their scores,
their wives and sweethearts whiled away
the hours dancing in the spacious pavilion.
J. D. Heise, one of the best known
marksmen in the State, was crowned king
of the festival after fully two hours of
shooting. Out of one hundred competi
tors Heise was the first to knock the
wooden eagle from its perch on a pole sev
enty-five feet high. The shooting was
done at 150 yards. When Heise succeeded !
In hitting the lucky spot that sent the j
eagle shooting groundward a cheer was
Bent up that could be heard for miles
around Heise was mounted on an impro
vised throne and his wife was soon at his
side In front of the assemblage of ad
miring friends and marksmen he implant
ed a sweet kiss on his wife's lips, much to
the amusement of the crowd.
Then the members of the .verein hoist
ed i , ,-â¢(â â  on a table and four husky men
carried him bodily through the grounds
and into the dancing pavilion, where he .
was crowned king of the festival. Miss
Atingers and Miss Theiss. two pretty
damsels, presented Heise with a wreath ,
of roses, and he then responded with a
neat little speech that brought forth more
fhfpns â â
Heise was crowned king of the last an
nual eagle shoot, which was held at the
same park on May 10 of last year. He is
one of the best marksmen in the country.
After the last eagle shoot Heise made a
tour of the Eastern cities and Europe, de
feating all comers at target shooting.
Previous to the main event the mem
bers of the verein shot at the eagle to
dismember it. The degree of accuracy
was measured by the different portions
of the dummy eagle, the crown being the
highest objective point and the left claw
the lowest. Following was the way the
members scored: , .
The crown, George Heyden; the apple,
J. M. Hartmann; the scepter, J. C. Wal

MARKET-STREET
COMPANY ASKS
FOR FRANCHISES
Bold Attempt to Secure From
the Board of Supervisors a
Wholesale Monopoly.
Would Grab the Valuable Geary-Street
Franchise and Cut Off Competition in
Almost Every Quarter of the City.
o The expected has hap- o l
o pened. The Market-street Q
o Railway Company, in an ef- o
9 fort to anticipate the re-
o stnctions of the new char- o
0 ter, has asked the Board of Â°
o Supervisors to betray the q
Â° people ana grant to it fran- Â°
q ch/ses aggregating in value o
o many hundreds of thousands Â©
o of dollars. Â®
In this wholesale attempt to grab the
right of way over dozens of the principal
streets of the city the railroad corpora
tion has not overlooked the franchise for
the Geary-street road. In order to get in
ahead of the provisions of the new char
ter, the corporation, acting In the name of
the Geary-street. Park and Ocean Rail
road Company, offers to surrender to the
city its present franchise for the Geary
street cable road, which expires In 1903,
provided the Board of Supervisors will
advertise for bids for the sale of the fran
chise under the present law. This and the
other franchises asked for would, if grant
ed, shut out competition in the matter of
the operation of street railroads so ef
fectually that the Market-street Railroad
Company would be put in possession of a
vast monopoly, in the hands of which the
people of the city would be powerless.
A hurried meeting of the Street Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors was
called yesterday afternoon just before the |
meeting of the board, the only person
present besides members of the com
mittee being Superintendent Henry Lynch
of the Market-street company! To the
committee Lynch presented the petitions
of the corporation, together with a type
written recommendation to be made by
the committee to the board. This .recom
mendation embraces all that the corpora
tion asks for in the petitions and some
thing niDre. It was immediately adopted
and embraced in the committee's report, i
which was presented to the board a few j
minutes later, Only the discovery that In j
its haste the corporation had overlooked I
an important and necessary proceeding
prevented favorable action being taken on j
the recommendation immediately. As it
is the matter was postponed for one week
and the public will have an opportunity to
express an opinion through those mem
bers of the board who will oppose the at
tempted wholesale steal of franchises.
The petition of the railroad company in
the matter of the Geary-street franchise
sets forth that the present franchise will
expire November 6, IW3; that the road
is now paralleled by electric roads, a fact
that makes it necessary to completely re
construct the line; that the cost of such
reconstruction is wholly out of the ques
tion under existing franchises because
they have but a short time to run.
Continuing, the petition reads:
Your petitioner therefore prays that your
honorable board will grant to the highest -
bidder, according to law, a new franchise
for a single or double track railroad over
the entire route of your petitioner's present
railroad as hereinbefore described, with all
necessary stations, side tracks, switches,
turnouts and appliances, for the term of â 
fifty year?, under such restrictions, condi

GEARY STREET. PARK AND OCEAN
RAILROAD COMPANY.
By J. L. WILLCUTT, Secretary.
The draft of a franchise accompanying
this petition first sets out a description
of the route now occupied by the Geary
street road, the conditions of the fran
chise being that the track or tracks must
be placed as nearly as possible in the cen
ter of the street; to plank, pave or ma
cadamize between the tracks and for two
feet on each side, and to keep the same
constantly in good repair; the tracks to be
no more than live feet between rails; the
owners of the franchise to pay the city
annually a percentage (to be fixed) of the
gross receipts of the road, providing that
no such payment shall be required for the
first five years; work on the road shall be
started within one year of the granting
of the franchise, and the road shall be
completed within three years; permission
is granted to use electricity, as a motive
power, the corporation being bound to run
cars at intervals of not less than fifteen
minutes between the hours of 7 a. m. and
9 p. m.; police officers and mail carriers
are permitted to ride on cars free of
charge.
The report, of the Committee on Streets
recommends that the petition of the cor
poration be granted and that the proposed
new franchise be granted as provided by
law.
The second petition, in which the corpo
ration seeks to secure franchises on
streets in almost every quarter of the
city. Is remarkable in its completeness.
The franchises asked for are of a nature

to be valueless to any other person or
corporation other than the petitioner.
This being so. there will be no competition
in the bidding for the franchises, and the
Market street company will secure valu
able concessions practically without cost.
At the same time it will gain franchises
on numerous streets and pieces of streets
and thus be enabled to effectually block
future competition. All of the franchises
asked for are to run for fifty years, and
are as follows:
Subdivision IâCommencing at the inter-,
section of Jackson and Sansome streets,
thence along Sansome to its northerly
termination. .
Subdivision â  âCommencing at the inter-,
section of Railroad avenue and Sixteenth
avenue south, along: Railroad avenue to San
Bruno avenue, thence along San Bruno ave
nue and llllllken street to the county line.
Subdivision 3âCommencing at the inter
section of California street and Thirty- â 
second avenue, along Thirty-second avenue
to Point. Lobos avenue.
Subdivision 4âCommencing at the inter
section of Point Lobos road and Forty
piÃhth avenue, along Forty-eighth avenue
to an unnamed street between A and B
streets, thence to Forty.sixth avenue,
thence to B street, thence to Forty-seventh
avenue, thence to C street, thence to Forty
ninth avenue.
Subdivision âCommencing at the corner
of Battery and California streets, thence
along Battery to Sacramento street.
.Subdivision 6âCommencing at the inter
section of Stockton and Pacific streets.
thence along Stockton street to Broadway.
Subdivision 7âCommencing at the inter
section of Hayes and Stanyan streets,
thence along Stanyan to Fulton street.
Subdivision Commencing at the inter
section of Taylor and Geary streets, thence
along Taylor to Post street.
Subdivision 9âCommencing at the inter
section of Geary street and Grant avenue,
thence along Grant avenue to Bush street,
thence along Bush to Sansome street. i
In the draft of the resolution granting
the above franchises is inserted the
clause that the person or corporation se
curing the franchises on the streets
named shall not be required- to pay to
the city a percentage of the gross re
ceipts for a period of five years. *
The report of the Street Committee rec
ommends that these franchises be grant
ed on the terms set forth. It also recom
mends that the Market Street Railway
Company be granted permission to use
electricity as a motive power on the fol
lowing named roads:
Brannan street, from First to Third;
Pacific street, from Kearny to Stockton;
Bush street, from Sansome to Battery;
McAllister street, from Devisadero to
Central avenue, and along Central ave
nue to "Fulton, and along Fulton to Sev
enth avenue; Hayes street, from Devisa
dero to Stanyan: California street, from
Central avenue to Firit avenue. Also to
use electricity as a mttive power on the
proposed "corkscrew road." so called. .
Added to the above recommendations
is one granting permission to the South
ern Pacific Company to construct a dou
ble track railroad on certain streets in
connection with its railroad to San Jose.
There was apparently nothing overlooked.
The petition of the railroad company
for the Geary street and other franchises
were first taken up for consideration by
the board. Supervisor Perrault imme
diately moved that they be referred to
the committee of the whole. This was
seconded by Supervisor Deasy, who said
he thought the matter entirely too im
portant for hasty action, in view of the
fact that the new charter was soon to go
into effect, and that by its provisions
franchises could not be granted for a
linger period than twenty-five years, and
that the city could also have the benefit
of other restrictions. Byington and Lack
mann also opposed hasty action. The mo
tion to refer was lost by the following
vote:
Ayes âByington. Deasy. Heyer, Lack
mann, Perraultâs. Noes âAlgeltinger. At
tridge. Black, Collins, Holland, Kalben,
Phelpsâ7.
Perrault then moved that the petitions
be referred to a select committee to con
sist of Deasy, Lackmann, Byington and
Heyer. Aigeltinger moved as an amend
ment that they be referred to the Street
Committee and that the gentlemen named
as a select committee be invited to sit
with the committee without power- to
vote. This was finally carried and then
a motion was mnde~to include Perrault
in the invitation. Pprrault asked to be ex
cused from voting for the reason, he said,
that "I see that the committee is doing
crooked work in this business and I do
not care to be mixed up in it." The mo
tion was lost.
The recommendations of the committee
were then taken up and Perrault moved
to strike out of the report all of that part
relating to street railway franchises. The
motion was lost on a tie vote, as follows:
AyesâByington, Collins, Deasy, Heyer,
Lackmann. Perraultâ6.
Noes â Aigeltinger, Attridge, Black,
Holland. Kalben. Phelpsâ
It remained for Byington to discover
the error made by the railroad company,
an error due to a desire to secure speedy
action in the matter. He made the point
of order that the report of the Street
Committee, or at least that part of it re
laing to the franchises, was riot properly
before the board because the petitions of
the corporation had not first been pre
sented to the board and then referred by
the board to the Street Committee. The
Mayor held that the noint was well taken
for the reason that the committee cannot
act on any matter not referred to it by
the board. When this ruling was an
nounced Aigeltinger changed his vote
from no to aye on the previous motion to
eliminate, and that motion was then de- i
clared carried. The whole subject matter I
was then referred to the Street Commit
tee, which means a delay of at least one
week before it can again he brought be
fore the board for initial action. This de
lay may prove fatal, as the time in which
the present Board of Supervisors can
grant franchises under the law is limited.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May Wheat started easy un
der heavy liquidation owing to Increased de- j
liveries and favorable weather. The decline !
was checked, however, by (sensational bad crop !
damages reports, backed with buying orders \
and samples of By-infected wheat from half a |
dozen different States. The 8 luthwest sent I
heavy orders to buy. Report that the Buffalo i
strike was practically ended finished the rout
of the bears, who bid the market up through- j
out calls. When calls were reached there was
a reaction of %c, but on the rush of crop dam- j
age news the market continued upward and
closed at the top. July opened unchanged at
73*<g73%c, touched 73% '.(T:v\c. declined to 73Uc,
advanced to 75Hc, and closed buyers at 7jc.
A decrease of 2,162,000 bushels in the visible
supply and cool weather strengthened corn.
July closed He and (4c higher.
An increase of 272.000 bushels in the visible
and large receipts weakened oats to-day, but
the market finally rallied in sympathy with the j
strength in other grains. July closed \ t c
higher.

THE STOCK MARKET.
Securities were quieter than for some time on
the morning session, and the only change wor
thy of note was a slight advnce in Contra
Costa Water to $71. /'i;- '
Business continued quiet in the afternoon at ;
about the morning's quotations.
â  The feeling in mining stocks was firmer and
prices made a general but slight advance. The
telegram from the pump said: "We are run
ning the second elevator on half time, keeping
the water just above the 1930 foot level. The
first elevator has been changed, and is now in
place, ready for lowering. We expect to have
it lowered and working again by the end of
this week."
The Alta Mining Company has levied an
assessment of 5 cents per share.
The Pacific Gas Improvement Company has
sent out notices to the effect that the divi
dend in June will be 40 cents per share. The
company has been paying 50 cents per share !
monthly for several years.
In the Ophir mine, in the old Central tunnel
ground, the direction of the northeast drift
has been changed to a north course, following
the hanging wall, and it is now out 270 feet,
with the face in a well defined clay wall, with
a mixture of quartz and porphyry. In the
bottom of the drift they find quartz with sul
phides of copper and iron, assaying $2 10 per
ton. They have started and driven 7 feet an
east crosscut from the north drift 95 feet,
south of the Mexican shaft, for the purpose
Of learning the exact position of the walls of
the vein In this neighborhood, as statements
have recently been made by old miners that
an old vein exists to the east and north of
the present workings, measuring from the !
Mexican shaft. The Sutro tunnel connection
was extended 15 feet; total, 13$ feet: face In
hard hanging wall rock that Is now showing
thin clay seams that cause the ground to break
better when blasted. Work has been continued
on the quartz stringers, and the southwest
drift extended 7 feet; total length. 10 feet, with
the quartz stringer between the clay walls still
In the face showing no ore. They will drift
on this stringer for some distance, and if noth
ing of value is found, will then sink the winze
deeper and prospect the ore that they have
found on the southwest side of the winze.
The following work was done in the Consol
idated California and Virginia mine during tn>Â»
past week, under the auspices of the Comstock
Pumping Association: 1400-foot levelâ west
drift has been extended 18 feet, total distance
from C. & C. shaft, 688 feet. The face is in
dry soft hanging wall rock. This drift has to
be driven Jfi7 feet further west before reaching
the east end of crosscut No. 2 from the 1400
--foot level of the Consolidated Virginia shaft
1650-foot levelâThe drifts connecting with
winzes from this level to the 1700-foot level are
being repaired to keep airways open. 1750-foot
levelâ The south drift from the west crosscut
has been extended Â« feet, total length 93 feet.
The force of miners has been engaged In shaft
work for nearly all the past week, so that but
little work has been done In this drift- a few
defective sets of timbers in the main west
drift have been repaired during the week The
winze station was to have been finished May
20. The hoisting engine to- be run by com
pressed air is in place, and the air pipe If on
the surface, ready for lowering into the shaft
1800-foot levelâ The opening and partial develop
ment of this level is fully described in the an
nual reports of the Consolidated California and
Virginia Company for the years 1891. IS!>2 and
1393. From these reports they learn .that no
connection was made with the winze leading to
the 1850- foot and 1960-foot levels. The plan that
is now being carried out has in view the open
ing of the 1800-foot level, the recovery of th
winze from which the 1800-foot was first open- i
ed, and a connection to be made with thÂ»
winze sunk from the 1750 to the 1950 When
these connections have been made the known
low-grade quartz bodies can bÂ» further devel
oped and such ore as will pay for extraction
mined. As the C. & C. shaft will he required
for the work of the pumping association an in
expensive hydraulic hoist can be placed In the
chutes that are now , USe ? for taking Waste roc*
from the 1860-fotf level to. the Sutro tunnel
and all the waste from the 1750-foot level and
nil points that ore to be reached through the
winze which la now equipped for work" can
be sent through the chutes of the Sutro tun
nel hOn the surface the preparatory work of
overhauling the main hoisting engine is being
given all possible attention â  â  â 
iJ'\ the Sierra Nevada mine on the 140-foot
level the north lateral drift is out 26G feet, with
the face in quartz. The west crosscut which
is out 16 feet, with the face In porphyry, has
neen stopped and an east crosscut started op
posite the mouth of the west one, which latter
crosscut Is out IS feet, with the face In quartz,
Â£}&/, and parser/. .On h.e SJJtoo.ot level thoj.
north drift from the west crosscut is out 58 fÂ«*t;
the face Is in porphyry.
In the Hale & Norcross mine the old Nor
cross tunnel hap been cleaned out anil retim
herod 52 -feet, making the total distance 117
feet. In the upper tunnel the south drift on the
company's Santa Fe ledge has been extended
5 feet, total, 8 feet; formation, quartz. .
In the Chollar and Potosi mines the' grading
from the dump to the mouth, of the Chollar-

bers In the Zadlg drift. â  dug drain and made
necessary repairs from the mouth of drift in a
distance of 260 feet. The face is in a cave
which has completely filled the drift. â¢
At the Osblston shaft, of .the Best & Belcher
and Gould & Curry mines they are putting in
a pipe for the purpose of getting water from
the Gould & Curry tank. They are still repair
ing the engine and building the brickwork .or
the boilers. On the Sutro tunnel level the
water has fallen in the. shaft 11 fe<?t 5 inches
during the week; total. distance below the sta

Take Action.
RESOLUTIONS ARE ADOPTED

QUARANTINE BOAT.
4 ction Is Taken on Various Matters
of More or Less Importance
to the City's
Interest.
The question of streetcar fenders is to
Bgain be put under official investigation
by the Board of Supervisors. At the
meeting of the board held yesterday af
ternoon the matter was brought up by
Supervisor Deasy in a resolution ailing
attention to recent fatalities and the ne
cessity for doing something to prevent
others In future. The resolutions; which
were adopted by a unanimous vote, are as
follows:
Whereas, The recent accident on an electric
street railroad which resulted in the death of
Ik child demonstrates ! that the guards on the
street railroad dummies are net sufllclent to
protect pedestrians from danger, and are not
co constructed as to afford adequate Lection
to persons who may unfortunately be passing
over and upon the street railroad tra.ck;.and
Whereas, The said guards should be so con
structed as to push any person on the track or
on the side th<rt-of out of danger and out of the |
way of said c.ir and dummy so as to minimize
the" danger from said dummies to persons who
upon the tracks come In contact therewith;
therefore, be it
Resolved. That the Committee on Health and
Police be and is hereby required to examine into
this subject and to report the character and
v description of a proper guard to be used, as the
I rf t=cnt devices possess none of the character
istics which insure safety to pedestrians in the
use of the public streets. It being a miracle if
the persons so struck by the. present guards in
use are not maimed or killed.
Resolved, That this board empowers and re
quests said committee to recommend a guard
which will afford the greatest protection to the
1 Ã¼blic the question of cost l*eing immaterial
as long as tlu? same insures public safety; and
In the opinion of this hoard no guard should
be recommended unless it is constructed so as
to push or force any person on the track or one
Fide thereof out of dancer and out t>r the way of
said dummy and car. and so constructed that
the force of the contact with the person on said
tracks be mitigated by the guard being further
provided with pneumatic rubber tubes or other
devices project lng from said dummy to accom
plish the purpose desired.
A majority report from the Committee
on Health and Police was presented rec
ommending that the resolution transfer
ring the. quarantine tug to the Police De
partment for use along the water front
be indefinitely postponed. Supervisor
Lackmann presented a minority report
signed by himself setting forth his belief
that the quarantine service is valueless
and imposes ii tax of $SOOO a year on the
city without resultant benefits. He there
fore recommended that the quarantine
tup be turned over to the Police Depart
ment. The majority report was adopted.
The report of the Ire Department Com
mittee that all bids for furnishing: forape j
for the Fire Department and public In- I
Btitutions for the cominc fiscal year be j
rejected and now bids advertised for was
not accepted. A motion was made and
carried granting the contract to Daniel
Keefe, the lowest ; fdder, it being the i
opinion of the majority of the members <
that the contention that he is not a dealer
in seme of the articles of forage called
for in the tpecitications was not well
founded;
The petition of the park panhandle ap
praisers for an increase of their compen- ;
sation from $500 to $2000 was granted, upon
j| recommendation of the committee to
which the petition had been referred.
A resolution was adopted granting Po- ;
lieÂ« Judge Charles T. Conlan thirty days' j
leave of absence from the State from May

GBAPE-NUTS.
GOOD TEETH.
Why Some Persons Are Enabled to
Keep Them Until Old Age.
Think a moment and you will re-
member that we build every part of
the body, teeth and bones included,
from what we eat.
Therefore, when any parts show
eth, for instance) before the
r time, there is evidence of lack
of the certain elements in th<- food
thaf keep th"m renewed each day,
or possibly there has been misuse.
â¢ rtaln field grains contain th"
ate particles of Phosphate of j
Lime needed for bone and teeth j
ng. Nature will not readily
use it if administered as a drug,
but quickly aocepta it when furnished
in the condition it is found in the
grains, i. c., direct from Nature's own i
laboratory. It is thus furnished in
the breakfast food known as Grape-
Xuts, and one may depend that the
regular use of this food will insure the i
introduction into the body of su<h
bone and teeth material as will binder
decay and add greatly to the appear-
and comfort of the user.

FIRE THREATENS EQUITABLE
GASLIGHT COMPANY'S PLANT
Dripping Oil Was the Cause of a Conflagration.
A KIRK in the plant of the Equitable
Ight Company at North Point
will cause the replacement of the
roof in the main building and will
represent a loss of about $1000. It was
caused by the leaking of oil from a valve
on the top of the coal hopper, !
near the roof; which ignittd from a gas
jet in the building. The Fire Depart
ment's speedy response prevented the
flames from communicating to the other
structures and the roofless works en
gaged in the manufacture of gas as usual
last night.
Assistant Superintendent R. S. Craig,
F. H. Tracy, the secretary of the com
pany, and about a half dozen worKmen
were standing In the room which con
tains the converters about 4 o'clock yes
â  . Preparations were just
being mad< for the firing up of the large
boilers which create the night's supply of
illumination. They were dismayed to see

cured a hose and commenced to play on
the flames, while Craig and others set to
the task of shutting off all of the valves
which lead to the two immense gasom
etera outside. "When this was done the
air engines sent a stream of air through
the inner pipes and receptacles, riddins
them thoroughly of gns. Meanwhile the
hose below hurst, and one which had been
pulled to the roof of the building could
make little progress in the extinguishing
of the flames.
Two alarms were turned in. The first
was sounded from b X 124 at North Point
and Lnrkin Btreet, and the second from

Six engines were soon on the scene, but

STREET WORK ORDERED.
RpFolutlors ordpring street work done were
not until tho entire roof of the room
which incloses the converters and
"scrubbers" had fallen in ashes. To keep
the fire from adjacent buildings was the
firemen's principal effort, and this they
accomplished successfully. Tho lire boat
Goveronr Markbam pulled up at the i
wharf, but was not needed.
When the cry, "The gas works is on !
fire," spread among the inhabitants of
North Beach terror reigned. To many of
th people flames in a gas works means
a territic explosion, a loss of life and the
destruction of- much property. The flames
shooting through the roof attracted hun
dreds to the tops of convenient bluffs.
Many remained some distance off, as the
fire, belching from the windows on the
west sid.'. nearly hipped the side of a big
gasometer.
A half hour after the fire -was extin
guished smoke was puffing from the
stacks which protruded through the
charred p>of. and the manufacture of gas
v..ts resumed. None of the machines was
damaged, and with the exception of a few
small pipes near the roof, which had to
be replaced, everything is intact. Tho
city was supplied last night, and the work
ol n-j'air will commence to-day. The loss
Is covered by insurance.

WILL BUTTLE
FOR THE COSTS
OF THE STATE
Grain Rate Litigation
Still Alive.
MOTION TO MODIFY DECREE
ATTORNEY GENEB.AL FORD WILL
FORCE MATTERS.
He Will Move That the State Be Al
lowed All the Money It Has
Spent in Defending
Itself.
The question of costs in the grain rate
cases recently dismissed by Circuit Judge
! Morrow on motion of . the attorneys for
the Southern Pacific Company will not be
allowed to go against the State without a
fight. The costs have not been assessed
to either party to the action as yet. but
the Attorney General is going to make
them a matter of issue by tiling a notice
of motion to modify the decree dismissing
the case so the State can recover its costs.
The costs will amount to over (43,000,
and the railroad is more than anxious
that they should be assessed to the State.
It was for that there was so much maneu
vering over the motion to dismiss, and
even now the motion filed by Mr. Pills
bury for tne railroad attempts to show
that the railroad "consents" to the dis
missal rather than asks that the case be
dismissed. Attorney General Ford is go
ing to make certain of the State's rights
in the matter. Last evening, in referring
to the steps in that direction he was re
ported to have taken, he said:
"I have simply made the necessary steps
to recover costs for the State in the event
( the court shall decide the defendants are
entitled to them. In conjunction with
Judge Hayne and Mr. Foote, I have pre
i pared a notice of motion to have the de
i cree of dismissal so modified as to allow
us our costs. "What view the court will
I take of the matter I, of course, do not
I know; but I should feel I had not done
: my full duty if I did not do what I could
jin that belief. The motion in relation to
, costs will probably be heard about June
5. Judge Morrow to-day made an order
! allowing us ten days after the decision
as to costs within which to file our cost
bills in the event costs are awarded us."

PACIFIC COAST COMPANY
CLOSES A BIG DEAL
OAKLAND, May 22.â Perhaps the larg
est deal ever made on the Oakland water
front has just been closed. It is the pur
chase of the bunkers, engines, machinery
and lease of the Oakland Commercial
Company by the Pacific Coast Company.
This immense transaction possesses much
significance, for it is proof that the Pa
cilic (."oast Company recognizes the great
advantages of the Oakland water-front
and intend to largely increase its trade
on this side of the bay, where rail and
water come together.
The bunkers were erected on Adams'
wharf but four years ago and at that
time were considered in the nature of an
experiment. They have always been act

LAUDATORY WORDS FOR
THE LATE JUDGE FIELD
SAN FRANCISCO BAR EULOGIZES
THE JURIST'S MEMORY. Â£
Dr. E. R. Taylor and Circuit Judge
Gilbert Pay Tributes to the Â»
Greatness of the De
parted.
There was quite a large gathering of
members of the bar yesterday morning in
the United States Circuit Court in re
sponse to the announcement that the Cal
ifornia bar would express its esteem for
the memory of the late Supreme Justice
Stephen J. Field. Among those present
were T. I. Berlin, Milton Andros, United j
States Court Commissioner Heacock, L. j
S. B. Sawyer, Southard Hoffman, Rev. I
Horatio Stebbins, United States Attorney
Frank L. Coombs, Assistant United
States Attorneys Woodworth and Ban
ning, ex-Supreme Justice John Curry, W.

man 1. Mowry, P. Mullany, Howard T.

Schaertzer, Dr. E. H. Taylor. United
States Marshal Shine, ex-United States
Marshal Long. United States Shipping ;
Commissioner Gwin, George Towle Jr., j
tin 1 . Captain John Birmingham.
Judges Morrow, Gilbert, Ross and Haw- i
ley occupied the bench, and after the j
?ourt had been called to order Dr. E. R. i
Taylor read a memorial sketching the
life of the jurist and a portion of his
career in this State. â  Dr. Taylor closed as
follows:
His was the shaping hand that drew order
in of chaos in the community where he first
became ..active as a public man; his was one
if the shaping legislative hands at the very
beginning of California's political life; no
other man contributed bo much as he to the
settlement of her land titles; and as a judge
no other one hand has made such an impres- ]
sion upon her judicial history. And when he
left the State Supreme bench for the higher
station of the Federal tribunal, his luster was
not dimmed by that of the great men about
him, but it shone with such additional bril
liancy as to make him beyond all question one
if the greatest judges this or any other country
has produced. In fact, to quote the language
of Chief Justice Fuller, "His judicial career
was unexampled in length and distinction.
Â» â¢ â¢ His labors left no region of juris- !
prudence unexplored, and now that he rests j
from them his work will survive him."
Judge Gilbert followed with appropriate
remarks, and the court adjourned out of !
respect to the memory of tne dead jurist. i

THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 23, 1899.
ATTACK BY A
PAIR OF VICIOUS
LEOPARD SHARKS
John Roy's Life and
Death Struggle.
ESCAPE ALMOST HOPELESS
THEIR TEETH REPEATEDLY IM
BEDDED IN HIS FLESH.
Had Waded Into Muddy Water to
Gather Driftwood When
H8 Encountered the
Sharks.
ALAMEDA, May 22.â John Roy, a far-
I mer at Bay Farm Island, had a desperate
! battle with a pair of leopard sharks orf
the island shore this afternoon, and bare
ly escaped with his life. As It was, his
clothing was torn and his flesh lacerated
in the encounter, and when he finally
reached the shore he was exhausted from
the struggle.
Roy was searching for driftwood along
the shore just before the affair happened.
A short distance out he saw a large log
drifting along with the tide, and he waded
out in his gum boots to secure it. He had
just reached the log and was in the act
of throwing a rope about it when some
thing beneath the muddy waters struck
I him a terrific blow, knocking him off his
Uel and submerging him. While he was
struggling under water he was struck
several successive blows, fortunately on
the legs, and he felt one of his rubber
boots grasped in a viselike grip that tore
the rubber and cut his flesh.
Regaining the surface, Roy saw that
the water about him was churned into a
foam and noticed a pair of huge leopard
sharks that were making vicious lunges
at him with their powerful tails, alter
nating v.ith attempts to sink their sharp
teeth into his flesh.
Being unarmed, the man was at consid
erable disadvantage. He essayed to wade
to shore, but the sharks swam about him
ontinued their attack. One of them
followed him into shallow water, and only
ct ased to light when it no longer had
room to swim.
Roy managed to reach shore, where he
fell exhausted on the beach. Jle was
much injured from the encounter. His
lower limbs bore evidence of the struggle.
Deep gashes were cut in his calves and
his legs up to the hips were a mass of
bruises from the vicious blows of the
sharks.
It is not an uncommon thing for sharks
of the leopard variety to be seen along the
Bay Farm Island shores, but they have
never b< lore been known to make such a
bold attack on a human being. Roy states
that the sharks he encountered were each
at least eight feet long.

-â¦â  f 1 \he many friends and admirers of Mrs. Lillian Ellis in this city received a pleasurable, surprise yesterday when â f i
Â© \ they learned of the fair lady's marriage on Thursday iast in New York City to A. C. Manners, a wealthy English- Â©
a 1 man. . Â£j '
V 1 News of the wedding came by telegraph to the mother, of the bride, Mrs. Emily Hanford, of 1642 Hyde street. V|
T -*- Mrs. Hanford had but a scanty knowledge concerning the very recent wedding of her daughter. "All I know," q
** said Mrs. Hanford. "is that Lillie and Mr. Manners were married in New York City on Thursday, the 17th. +
* The ceremony was celebrated In the apartments of my daughter at the Waldorf-Astoria. I imagine it was a case of q
Â© love at first sight. Lillie left here for New York on the Bth, which brought her in the Empire City on the 13th, so she Â»
"*" could only have known Mr. Manners four days before she joined her fate with his for better or for worse. All I know q
0 about Mr. Manners is that he is an. Englishman and a millionaire." +
j "*â  Mrs. Manners is recognized as one of the handsomest and most fascinating of California women. She is 27 years q
i Â© of age, a native daughter, and was educated in this State. According to the lady's mother the trinket of all her wealth
i * of jewels she most prizes is a Qenman School medal. . â  _

LIVED IN THE PALACE
OF THE SHAH OF PERSIA
COLONEL HENRY MOORE, an old mining man, appeared in Judge Mo
gah's court yesterday â  morning to answer a charge or vagrancy. i He was
arrested Sunday night in front' of the 'Lick House, on Montgomery street,
by Policeman Leonard, who told the Judge in court yesterday that the old
man was in the habit of standing In front of the Occidental Hotel and
Lick House and soliciting alms from people 'passing in : and out. ..
The Judge questioned the- old- man, whose appearance interested him. He
told the Judge. a brief part of his life story, and the Judge continued the case
till to-day, as lit was. puzzled as to what to do with him. â  -'
When the old -man was. seen in the City*' Prison later he said: "I .am a
forty-niner, and have been mining In the mountains in this State almost all my'
life. In 1876 I started on a tour of tin; world, traveling through Afghanistan. .In
dia and Persia. While at the capital of Persia I got introduced to the Shah by
the American Consul, and I was induced by the Shah to accept a 'position to
teach his children the English language. I remained there for five years and
had to leave through incurring the enmity of the Commander in Chief of the
Persian army. . â 
"I returned .to this coast and continued In my mining work till about â â  five
years ago, when I and my two sons wont to Coolgardle, Western Australia, at
the time the mining fever broke out there. My two sons and myself and an
other man worked a : mine there, and finally I sold out for $40,000 -and started a
temperance hotel. 1 incurred the enmity of people there, through my deter-,
mination not to sell liquor, and my hotel was set/on fire ; and. burned to - ; the
ground, leaving me almost penniless. My sons had left Coolgardle to go to Alaska
and I had to work my passage to this coast on a vessel. I arrived here with $115,
but that is all gone, and now I don't know what to do." '

COMMITTEE MEETS TO-DAY
PRELIMINARIES TO BE SETTLED
AND WOBK BEGIN.
So Many Sites Suggested That It
May Be Expedient to Decide
the Question by
Ballot.
When the committee to erect a monu
ment to the American navy in commem
oration of the victory of Admiral Dewpy
at Manila meets in Mayor Pholan's office
in the Phelan building at 4 o'clock this
afternoon there will be some flattering re
ports made on the reception of the move
ment by the general public. The mem
bers of the committee seized every op
portunity yesterday to discuss the matter
with their friends, and not a voice was
raised in disapproval of it. On the con
trary, many were the assurances of
hearty support, financial and otherwise,
that were received, and the members of
the committee are confident that all the
funds necessary to carry into effect the
most elaborate plans yet suggested will
soon be forthcoming.
The commitu-e will select some bank to
act as treasurer to-day, and it is more
than probable that some handsome checks
âthe first contributions to the fundâ will
be presented at this afternoon's meeting.
The method of collecting subscriptions
will also be decided upon to-day, and it
is certain that some arrangement will

contributions from the outside for the
Dewey monument is not going to be a
local affair. Although it will be erected
in San Francisco, the whole State is
vitally interested, and communications
are rapidly coming in from all sections
applauding th< movement and asking for
further particulars, while the interior
press is enthusiastically supporting it.
The suggestion that the monument be
ready for dedication on May 1, 1900
(Dewey day) has met with universal ap
proval, and it will be the aim of the com
mittee to have it ready for that date. As
there is nearly a year in which to pre
pare designs and have the statue cast or
carved, according to whether it Bhall be
of bronze or marble, there seems to be no
reason now why It cannot be done. The
question of finances is not calculated to
cause any delay.
The location of the statue is causing the
liveliest discussion, even at this early
stage, and it is not unlikely that the
committee will Inaugurate some sort of
voting contest to aid the members in se
lecting a sit.-, so many places having been
suggested, mion square Hnds favor with
many, although the entrance to the park

most frequently mentioned. The latest
suggestion is that the monument be

Dr. C Gkwcinakey, M 2 Pino stroot, and
his wife met In Judare Magan's chambers

Mrs. Oosctnskey explained to the Judge
that she and her husband had been legally
separated and she obtained thr custndy of
the boy. As flic had to work to support
herself and the boy she had placed nim
in the care of Mrs. Roemer. 2 Pearl street.
Her husband did not contribute a cent
toward the support of the boy.
The Judge told Goscinskey that he hntl
misrepresented th.> facta to him Saturday,
otherwise he would not have Issued the
search warrant, which was really to re
cover the boy's clothing; and enable the
father to see the boy and gel possession
of him. Goscinskey said that Mrs. Roe
mer would not allow him to gee the boy
and he wanted the Judge to make an
order to that effect. The Judge refused
