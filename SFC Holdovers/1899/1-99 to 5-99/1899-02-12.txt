in the Jungle After a Skirmish
Near Old Camp Dewey.
MANILA, Feb. Another
encounter took place last night
between the American troops
â¢and the insurgents, in which
Otis' men were once more vic
torious. A squad of the Four
teenth Infantry, which was on
outpost duty to the south of the
city, in the vicinity of the coast,
while engaged in reconnoitering
came upon a large body of Fili
pinos in the jungle close to old
Camp Dewey. The presence of
insurgents- in force so far re
moved from the scene of the re
cent hostilities was a surprise to
the Americans, and after a few
shots had been exchanged the in
fantry squad fell back upon the
main line.
On their reporting the pres
ence of the enemy a portion of
the Fourteenth Infantry and the
Fourth Cavalry were at once or
dered to advance and drive the
insurgents from their position.
A determined stand was made by
the rebels and the engagement
lasted for a considerable time
without any perceptible advan
tage being gained.
In the meantime a small gun
boat, which had been cruising in
the vicinity, hearing the noise of
firing, steamed up to the support
of the American troops. She
: swept the coast with her rapid
fire guns and Colts with excel
lent effect, and the Americans
"finally succeeded in driving back
the enemy after inflicting heavy
loss on their ranks.
.'.' Privates Ransom, Hensel and
Saunders of Company F, Four
teenth Infantry, and two troopers
: of â¢ the Fourth Cavalry were
wounded.
. The bodies of two members of
.the California regiment were sub
sequently found in the bush to
the right of the line. They had
been shot to pieces by the rebels.
One of these bodies was identi
fied as that of Private Abnep
pam, but the other has not yet
been identified. (The name given
here is clearly erroneous, the
mistake having been made in
transmission by wire.)
â¢ MANILA, Feb. 11.-2:30
p. m. â Early to-day the monitor
Monadnock and the cruiser
Charleston began dropping shells
into the rebel camp between Co
loocan and Malabon. The en
emy's sharpshooters in the jungle
oh., the American left had been
particularly annoying since day
light, so the Third Artillery
drove the rebels out of the jungle
a.i noon. In the meantime a few
more of our men were wounded.

senting. Harper's Weekly and
The Call and Herald, was shot in
the arm yesterday. The loss of
the enemy is estimated at fully
fifty killed and wounded to one
American killed or wounded.
The heat to-day knocked out
many more of our men than did
the Filipino bullets, especially in
the lands north of Malabon,
where the Kansas regiment was
stationed. Fully a score of them
were taken to the hospital.
Among the accidents of the
day it is cited that Privates Hart
ley and Fitch of the Minnesotas
were both wounded in the leg
by the same bullet, and Private
Mitchell of Company B of the
Kansas regiment, while assisting
a couple of men to the rear, was
shot in the left arm. â¢
The railroad is now open to
Caloocan, and supplies for the
troops â¢ are being forwarded by
rail.
The following additional par
ticulars regarding the capture of
Caloocan have been obtained:
The insurgents had been concen
trating their forces for days at
Caloocan, and Major General El
well S. Otis, the American com
mander, determined to attack
them. He instructed his com
manders accordingly and re
quested the assistance of the
naval forces under the command
of Rear Admiral Dewey. Major
General Mac Arthur reported that
all was ready, and at 3 o'clock "he
received the following message:
"The commanding general or
ders you to go ahead with the
programme. BARRY."
The attack began immediately.
The monitor Monadnock and
the cruiser Charleston shelled
Caloocan and the country north
of it for half an hour. General
Mac Arthur's artillery also did ef
fective work from a hill in the
rear.
Brigadier General Harrison
Gray Otis, with his brigade, con
sisting of the Kansas regiment,
the Montana regiment and the
Third Artillery, regulars, acting
as infantry, advanced handsome
ly, pushing forward in the face of
the Filipino bullets as cheerfully
as if they had been snowballs.
The enemy was utterly routed
and fled to the mountains.
At 6 o'clock "cease firing" and
"recall" were sounded. The
troops were then well through
Caloocan and north of it. Gen
eral Mac Arthur established his
left at Caloocan and strengthened
his lines for the night.
By the capture of Caloocan the
control of much of the rolling
stock of the Manila Dagupan
Railroad was obtained. The city
is now quieter and business is bet
ter than at any time since the out
break of hostilities.

VICTORIOUS DEEDS DURING
THE FIGHTING AT MANILA
By John F. Bass.
. NEW YORK, Feb. 11.â Mr. John F. Bass,
who has sent the following graphic descrip
tion of the week's fighting around Manila,
represents Harper's Weekly in the Philip
pines, through the courtesy of which paper
he also served as the correspondent of The
Call and Herald. He is a graduate of Har
vard University, class of 1890. This is not
his first experience with war. _He passed
through . the Turko-Grecian war as the cor
respondent of the London Daily News. He
sent The Calf-Herald's dispatch while suf
fering from a wound in the arm.
MANILA, Feb. - 11.â When hostilities
were, opened last Saturday the Ameri
can army encircled J Manila in two di
visions, the 'first brigade of the first
division, General Anderson's,, being un
der - command of Brigadier . General
King and the second brigade was com
manded * V by Brigadier ; General Oven
shine. The lines extended from the sea
along the * line of the Spanish block
houses, to the Pasig River in Sampaloc.
The second division, under General Mo-
Arthur, with the first brigade com
manded by Brigadier General Harrison
G. Otis, and the second brigade by
Brigadier General Hale occupied a po
sition to the north of the city from the
Pasig River to the. sea. The most ex
treme point inland occupied by the
American troops was the camp of the
Nebraska Regiment at Santa Mesa,
where the fight first began at 8:45
o'clock last Saturday night. .
The Nebraska outposts challenged
and fired on an insurgent . company
which was advancing into the neutral
zone. Soon afterward the whole in
surgent company was advancing into
the neutral zone.
It was not long before the insurgents'
lines on the north of the city began a
heavy fusillade. This charge was con
centrated; on the Nebraska camp,
which became untenable. .Orders were
given for the regiment to open fire.
Springflelds flamed In the half moon
all about the camp. The enemy's
Mausers gave no flash. At 4 o'clock on
Sunday morning, -with the shout "Viva
la;Republica," the Filipinos tried to
rush across ; the bridge over the ';' road
leading to the water works opposite
the American camp. ; One company of
the Nebraska men met the advancing
insurgents ,' at the v bridge and 'drove
them back. . . Twice the ; Filipinos, . with: I
indomitable pluck, charged ; upon the |
bridge again, | but they were driven {
back each time. .:â¢.',
' Lieutenant -Webb of ' Battery A, ( sta- j
tioned -on - Mesa i Hill, prayed- for. day- I
light, and when dawn came â¢ two guns
of the Utah Battery opened fire so
near to the firing J line ' that two': men
were killed at * once. , The : plan ;of * the
I second division was to sweep forward
and carry the high position held by the
enemy north of the Pasig River.
The Colorado volunteers under com
j mand of Colonel Mecoy rushed on block
houses No. 4 and No. 6, and the villages
beyond San Juan bridge were cleared
with shrapnel. The Nebraska men
made their way over the bridge,
crouching in pairs, amid the hissing
i and spattering of bullets. On the other
j side they were met with a surge of
j lead from the steep hill of San Juan.
But they were followed by two Norden
feldts under charge of Lieutenant
Gibbe. As these tumbled over '- the
bridge a battalion of Tennessee troops
approached and quickly followed across"
in columns of four under fire. Colonel
Smith fell from his horse and died of
apoplexy at the moment of the charge.
Up the hill the artillery and infantry
j scrambled, digging, with their hands
j and feet. Nothing could stand before
them. It was a grand sight. At 12
o'clock noon our men took the reser
voirs at the top of the hill. ' '?.?*-*_
Further to the left on the heights was
Binaldo Church. . In order to. take, this
the Americans did riot have to advance
up . the steep- incline, ' but could make
a gradual ascent over .two miles of
rough country. Barbed wire impeded
their advance. The Utah guns followed
the' advance of the troops step by step
to clear the way. The Third Artillery
moved along the dikes through a cul
de.sac with swamps on either side and
got into the open., losing twenty-five
minutes. Two batteries then swung to
the right under Captain O'Hara, going
into the open like veterans and drove
from the church the insurgents who
were pouring a cutting fire on the Mon
tana and Pennsylvania troops while
they were coming up the hill â¢ through
the cemterey toward Binaldo Church.
Colonel Frost, commanding the South
Dakota Regiment, swung that body
around from the left and carried two
Insurgent redoubts where thirty in
surgents were killed. The South Da
kota and part of the Pennsylvania
troops then took Binaldo Church.
The Concord, from the bay, shelled
the woods near the shore, and the Kan
sas men,; followed by. â¢ the â  Montana
troops and supported by ! one gun,
moved on Saturday night along Caloo
can road. The enemy charged them
six times, coming within one hundred
yards, but they were steadily pushed
back, until by â¢ Sunday night the Amer
ican line had advanced three miles. .
Thus all along the second division had
little difficulty in 1 , driving ' â¢ the enemy,
who fought ..well behind trenches, but
once dislodged fled in panic, r: Against
the first division south of the city , per
haps the fighting was the hardest. The
insurgents showed wonderful pluck un
der command of ' General I Noreal.
During Saturday night everything
was quiet, but at 7:30 o'clock on Sunday
morning from Artillery Knoll, General
Anderson's headquarters,, the Sixth Ar
tillery opened fire,' and from .the ; bay to
blockhouse No. 14, | where the .American
" troops entered ! Manila, the ground was
; held S by 3 the'/ North , Dakota I Regiment
and the Fourth Infantry.
The Monadnock; from her place in the
bay, pounded the. insurgents with her
big guns. ,; Captain Murphy, com

gan the fighting at 8 o'clock in the
morning. So stubborn was the resist
ance at this point that he only suc
ceeded In taking blockhouse No. 14. a
few hundred yards distant, at 2 o'clock
that afternoon. 'â¢,":;
This place is called "Bloody lane" by
the Spaniards. Lieutenant Michael fell
crying, "Never mind, men; go on."
â¢ Lieutenant Miles then took the lead.
One hundred yards from the block
house the fire was': so hot that he called
for volunteers, and with eight men he
took the place, the insurgents going out
as his men went in. 'yyy
- General Ovenshine was ordered to
dislodge the enemy in Murphy's front.
He formed a brigade of the Fourteenth.
Infantry, on the right of Murphy's po
sition, with volunteers on right of the
Fourteenth Infantry,' and troops E, C
and L of the Fourth Cavalry, dis
mounted, on the left of Murphy's men.'
All of the men to the right of Mur
phy's position wheeled -to the left
across an open field till the thicket was
reached. Then they opened fire and the
enemy was finally dislodged. The en-'
gagement was hot, but the fire of our
men - was irresistible. General-; Oven
shine with, his brigade then .proceeded
to Pasay, which he entered without re
sistance. . f
The line of the First Division on Sun
day night extended from the bay at
Pasay to the Pasig River at San Pedro
Macate. Farther inland our line
was along the stream to Triega, and
three miles in front was an open coun
try. â y~.Y : .ff
One and a half miles diagonally
across the line Colonel Smith, with
three companies of the California
troops, one Washington and four Wy
oming companies, was ordered to ad
vance toward San Pedro Macate.
General King was to move forward as
soon as Colonel Smith came opposite.
The troops waded the stream and
marched into the open country as if
they were on drill. From the stone
house, nipa huts and earthworks the
enemy poured bullets upon the Amer
icans, while Battery D, Sixth Artillery, ;
under Captain Dyers, and Hawthorne's |
separate Montana Battery continued I
to shell' the enemy magnificently over
the heads of the advancing troops."
At San Pedro. Macate the position of
the insurgents seemed impregnable.. but
Lieutenant Haven of Company A. En
gineer corps, forced a way back of the
town and by plucky work made the po
sition untenable for the enemy..
The Washington troops swam the es
tuary under fire, and later, the Idaho
troops, with one company of Washing
ton men, swept the insurgents toward
the left. One hundred of. the. Filipinos
jumped into the Pasig River, but only
twenty succeeded in getting across y the I
stream. The j village was burned *on

j The hospital corps did splendid work
for both friend and foe. The insurgents,

country and all along the line were
swept the first division.
On Monday afternoon the Nebraska
Battalion, the : Twenty-third' Infantry
and Tennessee troops. General Hale
commanding, with four guns, under
Major Youn<r of -Utah, swept the coun
try for four miles to the pumping sta
tion; They shelled the insurgents from
hill to hilly ' ' ' â¢â¢ . -
At the foot of the second hill was
found the stripped body of Dr. Young
of Utah, who rode through the lines by
mistake.' His horse had. been shot, and
twelve empty revolver cartridges. were
found by his side. The insurgents re
tired firing as they went, and at 5
o'clock in the afternoon on Monday, the
pumping station had been taken. The
cylinder heads had. been removed by
the insurgents, but' these were found
later in the coal works and are now in
good condition. ' â¢ â  â¢' - ' : â

General . Mac Arthur sent the Kansas
and Montana troops and the Third Ar
tillery to take the place. In a splen
did charge the Kansas men went
through the jungle near the shore. The
insurgents fought from tree to tree, but
were steadily driven back under a
heavy infantry fire. The Montana
'troops and the Third Artillery ad
vanced into the open for two miles
without shelter. The insurgents fired
from the edge of the woods and strong
earthworks in Caloocan.
Four guns of Battery A, Utah, and
two guns of Dyers' Battery, under
lieutenant Fleming, shelled the posi
tion accurately, and before the splendid
charge of the infantrymen the insur
gents fled. .
â¢ Lieutenant Colonel Wallace was shot
through the lungs, but he will recover.
Our men rushed into Caloocan with a
shout. _he American flag was raised
on the church at 5 o'clock In the after
noon: The insurgents fled on and in
every direction were followed by our
enthusiastic soldiers.
â¢ The charge could not be stopped un
til they had reached a point a mile
beyond Caloocan. The town was
burned .to dislodge , the sharpshooters.
Our losses were three killed and thirty
eight wounded.
Every department of the army de
. serves the highest praise. There is no
chance of an insurgent uprising in the
town with the vigilant administration
of the provost marshal. General
Hughes. ,
All the supplies are up within the fir
ing line. The present line is about
twenty miles long, encircling the city
at the bay, from Aupan at Pas Ryon,

ACCUSE AMERICANS
OF TREACHEROUSLY
BEGINNING BATTLE
Demoralized Filipinos Send Out
Most Peculiar Version of the
FightiQg at Maoila.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, . Feb. 11.â European I
Filipino Junta received to-day a long j
telegram from Agoncillo. the American I
delegate, from Montreal, declaring he !
:.left Washington in consequence of a
telegram which '" c received on Febru- '
ary 4 from Aguinaldo, urging him to 1
cable to Malolos the result of the vote j
of the United States Senate on the ;
peace treaty. Aguinaldo, it appears, 1
added: "It is of the most urgent Im- ;
portance that we should at once be ac
quainted with the decision, as we are j
negotiating with General Otis and the i
Vote will vitally affect the negotia- j
tions."
â¢ Agoncillo further declared that as he
was closely shadowed by the American j
authorities to dispatch this telegram
would have been impossible and he j
therefore proceeded to British terri- I
tory.
Agoncillo also says he was persuaded I
the treaty would not be ratified and j
points out that the "three votes by j
which it was passed were only obtained
at the last moment and as the result
of the outbreak of the hostilities."
The agent of Aguinaldo again ex- j
pressed his conviction that the out
break was "provoked by the Americans ;
for this very purpose."
The telegram concludes: "The Fili
pinos were anxious to maintain friend
snip with the Americans and had for- j
mally decided never to be the aggres- j
sors."
Several dispatches have also been re- '
ceived here from Filipino sources, dated ,
from Manila via Hongkong, and give
the rebel version of the outbreak of
hostilities. A Filipino dispatch dated '
Manila, February 5, says:
"On Sunday a force of Americans at- j
tacked simultaneously Caloocan and i
Santa Mesa. Two American warships
Were off Malabon and Malate, and a
smaller gunboat was in the Pasig
River to protect the American flank.
"For several days previously the !
Americans had been endeavoring to !
provoke hostilities, and peace was
maintained only by the rigorous order
of Aguinaldo, who was negotiating
with General Otis for an honorable un- j
dertaking. The American attack
was unexpected. The ships- destroyed
al) the villages between the shore and
the Pasig River within an area be- j
tween Malate, Paranaque, San Pedro I
and Macati.
"Crossing the river, the Ameri- '
cans advanced to San Juan del
Monte, capturing the waterworks after i
a severe fight. They then proceeded to j
; Sjngalon, establishing themselves on !
.the river dam. The" took a mile of j
the . rails from the Caloocan-Malolos
railway and cut the te.epraph wires in !
order to stop communication with
â¢Aguinaldo.
'â¢ "The Filipino forces engaged num- j
bered only 7000, including 1000 Ne
gritos. Acting on instructions from i
â¢'Malolos, the Filipinos remained strictly I
on the defensive, and finally retired in j
good order without any loss of arms, ar
tillery or ammunition. Two old Krupps
mounted on the fortress of San Antonio
were captured. The fighting was very
! stubborn and lasted continuously from
Saturday to Tuesday.; .â' f'.-"
"General indignation has been occa
sioned by the treachery of the; Amer
ican surprise. The Filipinos believe -that
the Yankee administration Is pply. fa
vored by a minority of Americans Â£n<i
: abstain from â¢ taking the offensive^ in
order to show their gratitude -to the
American nation for helping ;tiie-xi' in
getting rid of Spanish rule. Hence they
will only fight when attacked, and their
future action depends on the decision, of
the United States. Aguinaldo declares
,-that the real enemies of peace are the
. American officers in the Philippines.

. LONDON, Feb. 11.â A dispatch to
Reuters from Manila describing the
' capture of Caloocan, dwells upon the

ried out. ' -
The dispatch adds: "At 4 p. m. the

HEALTH CONDITIONS
OF MANILA TROOPS
; WASHINGTON, .'Feb. . 11.â In re
sponse to a resolution of Inquiry 'the
Secretary of War to-day sent to the
Senate a statement from the surgeon
general in regard to the health condi
tions of the troops, in the Philippines.
He says that the sickness in some regi
ments has been as high as 17 per cent,
but .that, he believes that the average
'has seldom exceeded 10 per cent. "
He" also says that climatic conditions
do not appear, so far, to have been at
tended by unusual mortality. He adds
that malarial diseases have caused no
deaths, and gives the total death rate
as shown by the returns for July, Au
gust, September and October as equal
to 9.36 per thousand, which Is only
slightly in excess. of the rate in garri
sons in the United States in time of
peace. More than half the deaths were
caused by typhoid.
' A peculiar fact is noted as follows:
Injuries, notwithstanding 127 cases of
wounds received at Cavlte and Ma
nila, give a smaller rate of .admissions
than is ordinarily found among United
â¢States troops in their home garrisons
and the death rate from accidents and
who were barbarously mowed down,
even when the Americans saw they
were only armed with bows and arrows.
They fought with great courage. The
American dead include one colonel, 46
other officers and 195 rank and file, over
500 wounded and 300 prisoners. General
Otis proposed an exchange of prisoners,
and to this the Filipinos agreed, parol--
Ing the prisoners.
"The Filipino forces south of Manila
are concentrating at San Mateo, An
tipolq and Cainto, whence they will be
siege Manila.
"The Americans are now fixing the
limits of their sphere of occupation. It
will extend all along to the east from
Paranque to Malabon on the shore, and j
from Caloocan to Mainbunea and San ,
Pedro Macate. -.â¢':â 
"There is much apprehension among i
the Americans, who are searching all !
the houses, confiscating all weapons, in- I
eluding table cutlery*, and summarily j
shooting in the streets all possessors of i
arms. These actions have resulted in |
sanguinary street fights 'at San Palo,
Loma, Blnondo and Manila, caused by
hatred of ' the American soldiery. The
latter are imprisoning non-combatants
as prisoners of war, and in revenge the
Filipinos kill Americans in the streets,
but are respecting other foreigners.
"Inform the American Senate and
Congress of this, and tell them the Fil
ipinos are friends of America, but will
fight against military despotism. Agon
cillo, the Filipino delegate, will ask for
European intervention in the interests
of peace. In the meantime the Filipinos
will fight.
"A schooner laden with ammunition
has been captured, but two others have
arrived safely and have discharged â 
their cargoes. Aguinaldo is on his way ;
here. He will recapture the lost posi- :
tions, organize a guerrilla warfare and
commence a general attack. The Gov- j
ernment and Congress of Malolos are
acting as usual and has passed a vote
of confidence in Aguinaldo."
HONGKONG, Feb. 11.â Filipino
Junta has posted the following state
ment:
"A Manila steamer has arrived here
with American censorship, giving a j

terly false. The Americans commenced
bombarding heavily, and by the treach- j

land and sea. Aguinaldo possesses a !
signed guarantee from the American
commissioners that there would be no j
hostility' on their part. Hence the Fill- \
pino troops were resting and many of j
the Filipino officers were at the theater j
on Saturday night and were arrested i
shortly before the outbreak.
"The bombardment of the defenseless
towns of Malate, Paco, Santa Ana and
Malabon caused , frightful slaughter
among the women and children. It is
estimated that 4000 of them were killed.

"Aguinaldo sent commissioners to in
quire of General Otis the reason for the
hostilities, offering summary punish
ment if the Filipinos were found to be
at fault. He received no satisfaction.
The Americans are apparently deter
mined on a. war of extermination, simi
lar to their doing in the Carolines in I
. November, violating the rights of man
kind and of civilized warfare and com
mitting a monstrous outrage on civili

action of General Otis was a political
move to influence the vote of the United

the corruptions at Manila.

Result of a Day's Debate in the Sen
ate Is an Agreement to Vote on a
Resolution Declaring a Phil
ippine Policy.
Special Dispatch to The Ca11..?
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â After* a
spirited debate of more than two hours
this afternoon by unanimous consent
agreement was made by the Senate to
vote on the resolution of McEnery of
Louisiana, declaratory of a policy of
the United States as to the Philippine
Islands. The request for the unani- j
mous consent agreement was made by i
Mason, which seemed the conclusion of
the debate upon the question and after
several Senators who were known to be
opposed to any action on the resolu- |
tion had temporarily left the chamber. i
Upon their return to the chamber they j
learned what had happened in their ab- j
sence, and later in the afternoon Haw- |
ley gave notice that at the proper time
he would endeavor to have the agree
ment vacated. '
â  Consideration of the legislative, ex
ecutive and judicial appropriation bill ;
was concluded and the bills passed j
just before adjournment.
During the debate Mason gave notice j
that he meant to continue his warfare in
the interest of the resolution, and that
he would stay here until the snow should i
fly next December if necessary to get the |
resolutions adopted. Mason asserted
that the United States had been the ag
gressor ln the Manila conflict by tramp
ling upon the rights of the Filipinos.
They had sought every means of secur
ing a peaceful settlement and we had
driven them out. "When Aguinaldo had j
asked the poor privilege of a conference j
our commander had refused without i
knowing what he had to offer. His re- 1
quest had been ignored and we had gone
on burning his villages and shooting his,
people like dogs, a la Weyler. * '-.
. Mason gave deliberate notice of a fill
buster, saying he would speak each .day
until the resolutions were acted upon: "I
will take all the time I want," he said.
"I begin to appreciate the glorious privi
lege of Senatorial courtesy. .-
Mason then entered upon the contention
that the United States was rapidly. be
coming a puppet of Great Britain and
he read' a poem entitled "The Lion's
Whelp," which he said illustrated the re
lationship, the following lines from which
Illustrated its spirit:
: "I know thee, now my lion's whelp; '
It could be none but thee."
, This country was even growing more
cruel than England, and cruel not to our
enemies alone, but to our own people.' He
heard it said that the Filipinos. could not
be conquered with the loss of only 3000 or
4000 lives. According to his way of think
ing, one American life was worth more
than those of all the natives on the isl
and. How many Senators had sons there?
Or had all the Senatorial appointees re
tired before the approach of danger?-'
"If you would only show me where we
could steal something," he exclaimed, "I
j might excuse the proceedings on the
' ground of high statesmanship; but I fall
i to see where we are to get any return
! for our outlay." The whole matter looked
' to him like murder and travesty upon our
professed following of the lowly Naza
! rene. " '
i At the close of his speech, Mason asked
for unanimous consent for a vote on the
; McEnery resolution at 2:30 p. m. next
| Tuesday, and, no one objecting, the vote
i was set down for that day.
TRIBUTES TO THE
LATE NELSON DINGLEY
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11â memory
of the late Representative Dingley was
fittingly 4 eulogized in the House to-day by
those 'who had been closely associated

given to some minor . routine work, and
the eulogies, which were a special order,
had the balance of the day. The tributes
came from both sides of the. House.

PROOF AGAINST ELECTRICITY. !
REDLANDS, Feb. 11.â E. L. Crawford,
electrical engineer at the power house of
the Southern â¢ California Power Company
in Santa Ana Canyon, made ' a short cir
cult ; last evening â : by J striking his ; head
against a live copper wire carrying 30,000:
volts, while standing; upon a transformer.
How much of the current passed through,
his body cannot be approximated, but It
was sufficient to blow out I the fuses 'in
the power house; Yet Crawford was un
injured by the electric volt, save a slight
burn upon the head. The shock caused
him to fall- a distance of eight feet to
the floor, cutting a deep and ugly wound
upon his head where -he. struck: upon the
transformer. That the electric shock did
not kill him instantly is considered mi

LOSES POWER TO

Aguinaldo, Beaten on fill Sides,
May flee to the CoQtineQt _
to Avoid flrrest;
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11â General ,
Otis had another victory to record this
morning,* and though the action before
Caloocan did not result in as heavy loss
to the American side as the battle of
last Saturday night and Sunday morn
ing," it is believed to have quite impor
tant results. Caloocan is on the line; of
railroad connecting Manila with Malo-'
los, the insurgent capital, and it may be
that the capture of the first named
town will- make it possible to advance
rapidly "by rail upon the insurgent
headquarters if it shall be deemed nec
essary to force the fighting and under
take the capture of Aguinaldo. Â,. , '
The officials here were encouraged to
day by General Otis' quotation of the
opinion of credible personsâ
It is understood to the effect that Agui
naldo no longer has the power to keep
the insurgents under his lead, and this
points to an early submission of the
insurgents to the American Govern-,
ment. None will be allowed to come
Into Manila, however, until they have
laid down their arms for good. As for
Aguinaldo, it is now believed that he
â¢will refuse to the last to make terms
that would meet with the approval of
General Otis, and that when the insur
rection falls through he will make his
escape to the continent rather than re
main in Luzon.
General Miles is very anxious con
cerning the fate of the army reorgan
ization bill, and fears it may not pass
at this session.

was also' in -connection with the per

thusiasm was shown during the prog
ress of the play, and again the audi
ence kept up a lively running fire of
comment. 'There were,- however, this
time several counter ' manifestations,
and for a short interval the perform
ance on the stage had to be suspended
while the one in the auditorium was
brought .to an end. A sort of a free
fight ended in the utter defeat and
flight of the anti-Imperialists.
The Figaro yesterday reproduced a
passage from the St. Petersburg Vi
Edomesti stating that Prince Louis
Napoleon had been received, by the
Czar, who invited him to stay to

he will confer with his brother, Prince

AMERICA'S CASE IS
DIGNIFIED AND ENERGETIC
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â sudden
change In the attitude of the German
Government, respecting the complications
at Samoa, reported in the press dis
patches, is attributed here to the fact that
Embassador White, within the past day
or two, has been able to deliver to the
German Foreign Office the formal pre
sentation of the American case. While
dignified in tone, it was a good deal more
energetic in . remonstrance against the
conduct' of the German officials at. Samoa
than Mr. White had given expression to
or perhaps had even conceived. But, in
asmuch as every, claim of our Govern
ment has been based on a strict adher
ence to .the lines of the .treaty of . Berlin,
the German Government has found itself
under the necessity of moving to secure
an amendment to- that convention- in the
line of Its desires, according to the usual
methods of diplomacy. The 'United States
and British Governments doubtless will :
give a ready response to any- Invitation on
the part of the German Government for

MOB LYNCHES THREE
NEGROES IN GEORGIA
ATLANTA, Ga, Feb. 11.â A telephone
message at midnight from Losburg, in
the southern part of the State, says a mob
took Cupid Redding and two unknown
negroes from the jail there to-night and
lynched them. The prisoners were deliv
ered after a short parley with the Sheriff
and the mob at the jail. The prisoners,
were secured and, 1 according to the tele-'
phone advices, the mob started for the
woods with them. ' '
Governor Candler to-night- ordered a
company of State militia from Albany
to Losburg to prevent, if possible, the
lynching of a negro at the latter place.
It was reported to the Governor by the
Sheriff of Lee County that a party of
lynchers would take the late night train
at Smithville and come to __osburg for
the purpose of lynching the negroes. The
Governor was not informed of the ne- ,
Â§ roes' names, but was told that they had
been arrested: and jailed at Losburg dur
ing the afternoon. 'â -â "â  .;,
The black men lynched are believed to
have been concerned in the assault upon
Mrs. Roney, which was one ot.the most
atrocious crimes of the century. In De
cember the house of John Roney,- a school
teacher, was' entered by CUpid Redding
and two companions. The leader of the
black trio ordered % . Roney to hold out his
hands and. he tied -them behind his back,
after which they bound him to a box. The
negroes then- ransacked the .house, and,
having completed -this part-, of their work.
Redding attacked Mrs. Roney.cl.rt sight of
her helpless and infuriated â  husband.
PRICES' OF. MEAT
ASCEND SKYWARD
LOS -ANGELES, Feb. 11.â The wholesale
.price of meat has taken a jump within the
â  last 'week that is phenomenal. In that
time' .prices have advanced 25 per cent,
and there Is no prospect of a decline. The
wholesale quotations on meat that go Into.
.forqe'on Monday are, In cents: Beef, 7%;
veal, 7V_; mutton, 9; pork, 7%.
There has been no such advance since
the time of the washouts in 1898, except in
a few Isolated cases. The general public
is blissfully unaware of the tremendous
Increase. It is predicted next week will
see an advance In retail prices to cone
spond with the wholesale prices". Beef
will reach the highest figure. Arizona
has been supplying the Southern Califor
nia market, but the supply has been pret
ty thoroughly exhausted, and now buyers!
are purchasing cattle in and around Ba
kersfleld and other northern points and
In Nevada. The wholesalers unhesitating-
ly declare that beef will reach 9 cants
very : shortly. The cause of this unusual;
advance is attributed chiefly to the dry,
weather here and the severe weather in
Oregon and .Washington, with a conse
quent shortage of fat cattle. >','!

. LONDON. Feb. 11â The dispatches
from Manila occupy a prominent posi
tion 'in the British - newspapers, and
there is no doubt that the American
victories are popular here.', _ The British
cannot understand the incredible folly
of the- Filipinos in forcing hostilities,
which is put forward as proving the,
correctness of the American view that
they ' are at present incapable of self
government. . .' .... \* . f'\'.y.f
The weekly newspapers devote con
siderable. space to â¢ the developments of
the past week. The Speaker says: ; ...
"The American â¢ course is justified by
the account :of the ' fighting, and even
more fully by the Filipinos' own state
ment of their case. Their efforts to
starve and worry the American troops
into sickness and their generals . into
concessions culminated â ' * With an at
tempt to control the water supply of
the city, which would have resulted .in
intense suffering . to 300,000 people non
combatants. I The Americans' resistance
taught the Filipinos- a severe lesson on
the customs of civilized warfare."
Â The Speaker predicts that there will
be little more real fighting, expresses
the opinion that the real difficulty is
how the government of the Philippines
is to be carried on, and -says:' â â¢
"The only way America can -fulfill
her mission is by a trained civil serv
ice. The brilliant reputation - acquired
by West Point . during .the past fifty
i years encourages the hope that a ; civil
j service academy will meet with no less
I success. Few people take more kind
| ly, to training" or acquit themselves bet
ter than the American graduate.' - He
I has more adaptiveness than his Eng
lish colleague; has probably more ener
gy and a stronger will. We have little
â¢doubt that v a _ trained civil service ; for
her new possessions will show Amer
ica the â¢ desirability of a trained civil :
â  service for . herself." ... y .'... ,:'
â  . The . Saturday Review says: "The
thought of what would have happened
at Manila if Aguinaldo's savage troops
| had been let loose In its streets -is it- j
self sufficient to make us view the vie- :
' tory with ' satisfaction. '. The revolt
â  however, is not* likely to end with the
slaughter around Manila. The guerrilla
warfare which â¢ the Filipino can wage
effectively may tax the resources of the
Americans for ; many : a - day."
, Utterances . instructive to Americans
as y reflecting the opinion of â¢ hard
headed. business men here toward " the
United States, were made at the an
i nual, meeting of the Chamber of Shlp
ping, which is composed of the lead
ing ship owners of .'the Urilte.d King
dom ' f s
, The. chairman", in his opening address,
which was openly "applauded, said that
excellent relationship. now existed
between . Great Britain '.. arid.; ' America
there, were questions which would haVe
to be faced and settled. '". He .hoped the
Foreign Office would not agree to the
abrogation of . the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty . unless the neutrality of the
Nicaragua* canal and non-preferential
rates were guaranteed to Great Britain.
The chairman further remarked, that
Great Britain also had the greatest in
terest in the ultimate control of the
Philippine Islands, as up to pow the
valuable carrying. trade, from the. is
lands had been almost entirely in
British hands,, and he urged the- Gov
ernment to lighten the heavy burdens
of the ship owners, in view .of the in
creasing competition of . Germany and
the fact that America was doing every
thing possible to get her trade carried
in her own vessels.
â¢ The Speaker, referring to the fore
going references to the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, ; says: .â¢â  ,y y -:; .; *- yf.:.
- "We do not think , both bills before
Congress are clear. and satisfactory Â- to
British- interests, and it is desirable
that the guarantees should be stronger
than ordinary law." -.""â¢' y'-'y...

RAILROAD PAPERS
WORKING FOR A
SENATORIAL CAUCUS
Barns Forced to Pull Every Wire for His
Assistance.
LASH WIELDED BY THE RECORD-UNION.
Organ of the Southern Pacific Dictates to the Legislators
bib' and Insists on Their Binding Themselves to the
Wishes of the Man From Mexico.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 11.â Dan Burns has made
another bid for a Senatorial caucus.
This . time the proclamation comes
through the editorial columns of the
Record-Union, the recognized organ of
the Southern Pacific Company In Sac
ramento.
The railroad ownership of the
Record-Union ls so well known that up |
, lo to-day the paper has refrained from j
... espousing the cause of Burns in its j
. editorial columns for fear that by so j
â¢dqihg.lt would brand the Mexican as j
the railroad candidate and thereby
: damn his chances of success. As the
: Contest now stands, however, Burns
â¢ finds himself in desperate straits and
;ls forced to resort to whatever means
'; are in his power to prop up his failing
fortunes. In his extremity he has
â¢ Bought the aid of W. F. Herrin, and
: that astute politician has sought to aid
ills, favorite through the columns of the
railroad organ, the Record-Union.
"b - 'lt is well known to all who are ln
-touch, with the situation here that there
â  are certain members of the Legislature
who would betray their constituents
â¢ and vote for Burns if they could do so
and make the defense that their action
was the result of a party caucus. They
;.-would go into caucus, where a secret
ballot would cover up their shame, and
/vote for Burns as the caucus nominee.
â  These same men would then go on the
floor of the joint Assembly and cast
â¢.their votes for Burns and defend their
action by declaring that he was the
â  caucus nominee and that they were
compelled to vote for him whether they
Wished to or not, they having first gone
into caucus and agreed to be bound by
the majority vote of the caucus.
'".â¢â¢ .it Â«as witii ilie nope tnat some such
: result, might be obtained that the rail
road, manipulators authorized the in
spired editorial in the Record-Union
this morning. That this was the pur-
f lose which. the editorial in question
n'tended to achieve is made apparent
: by reading the following extract from
â¢Mr, 'Herrih's literary production: .:
'. '"There is a method by which a Re
publican United States Senator can be
chosen, and that is by calling a council
of the â¢ representatives of the party.
There are eighty-six Republican mem
bers-of the Senate and Assembly. They
'possess the intelligence necessary to an
agreement as to a Senator in Congress
for: the next six years. They owe this
â¢ duty to the party at whose hands they
have received an election, and they will
â¢ fill to" discharge it at the peril of their
'political fortunes. They owe to the par
ty the holding of a party council to
which should be referred the overshad
owing question.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ }*y {'.
''In view of all these considerations,
.It is ..the duty of the eighty-six Repub
lican members of the Legislature to
â¢.meet together in council for the pur
f>ose of deliberating upon the highest
nterests of the party. This they owe
to -the Republicans who have elected
them to office and at whose hands they
have accepted the trust of acting in ac
cordance with the highest interests of
the Republican party. If a deliberative
party council of this. kind, held in a
.spirit of conservatism, presided over by
partisan patriotism, guided by party
fealty, and honestly striving to harvest
the- fruits of a Republican victory, is
unfit/to be trusted with the fortunes of
â¢ any Senatorial aspirant, that aspirant
Is .unfit to be elected to the office of
i United States Senator. Whoever re
â¢ fuses to submit his political fortunes to
such a council of the party is unworthy
'of! honor at the hands of the party it
' self. Let the test be made at once. Let
â¢the Senatorial candidates whose per
sona!" ambitions are standing in the
.way of .party success and defrauding
-the party out of the fruits of its well
â¢ earned victory, declare themselves at
â¢.once on this question; and the Senato
' rial candidate who refuses to submit his
claim to a deliberate council of his fel
low partisans will prove beyond all

The threat that is conveyed in the
wording of the article is apparent, and
is an indication of the methods Burns
and his corporation supporters intend
to resort to in order to achieve their
end. It remains to be seen whether the
members of the Legislature will con
sent to be bullied by Burns or whether
they will continue to do as they have
done in the pastâ vote for the men of
their choice, regardless of the wishes
of Burns, Herrin & Co.
When the two houses of the Legis
lature adjourned to-day until Monday
the touts of Colonel Burns were putting
on the boldest front of the week. The
verified information that Senator Smith
of Kern had been listening to sugges
tions about entering the field himself
as a candidate for the United States
Senate encouraged the touts to believe
that the entering wedge had been in
serted into the Grant column. Senator
Smith in discussing the situation to
day said he had received word from
supporters of Bulla and Barnes that
they would view his candidacy with
favor. He did not regard such mes
sages as a promise of voting support
and would wait for something more
definite before announcing that he was
in the field as a candidate.
From'the outset Senator Smith has
been a supporter of Grant. In fact he
was turned down in the matter of the
chairmanship of the Senate Finance
Committee because he was in the Grant
fold. It is regarded as remarkable now
that he should allow his name to be
used to break the solid forces of Grant.
Burns and his touts are relying on j
Herrin and the Southern Pacific to ad
minister the medicine to bring about a
caucus. It Is whispered around that
mild hints and suggestions are to be
put aside and drastic measures; em
ployed to line up the men. who have
been counted to stand in when the time
arrived for decisive action. It is the
talk in the Burns corral that Senators
Dickinson, Morehouse, Simpson, Cos
per and six more members of the Leg
islature must now go to the colonel's
rescue or forever part company with
the corporation. The people of the
State of California will study the
events of next week with absorbing in
terest. Should Burns fall after this
desperate effort he will open negotia
tions for the election of some man who
will be useful to the machine in politics.
Burns and the "organization" do not
want a Senator to represent the people
of California and to sustain the admin
istration of President McKinley. The
machine idea of an acceptable Senator
is one that will act chiefly as an agent
in Washington to procure and distrib
ute Federal patronage.
The attendance at the joint Assembly
to-day was so slim that danger of elect
ing a Democrat for Senator was scent
ed. Dibble announced that pairs as be
tween Grant and Burns had been de
clared off. Cutter corroborated the
statement, and therefore all supporters
of these candidates were asked to par
ticipate in the proceedings of the con
vention. As it turned out the whole
number of Senators and Assemblymen
voting was only 79, and the number
necessary for a choice was consequent
ly forty. To avoid any possibility of a
mistake about a joint meeting on Sun
day, the convention adjourned to meet
Monday noon. The two supporters of
Irving M. Scott say their candidate will
return to the scene of conflict next
week, in order to be on the ground
when the break from Grant and Burns
comes.
There is no doubt now that Grant is
willing to sacrifice his own ambitions
to allow the election of a Republican
Senator, but the touts, who have no
comprehension of devotion to party, ac
cept any suggestion of sacrifice as a
confession of weakness. This may force
the Grant men to renew their determi
nation to vote for Grant until the Leg
islature adjourns. From every section
of the State messages come that no
Senator would be preferable to the.elec
tion of Burns.
Despite all the boasting and the as
sumed air of confidence in the corral of I
Burns, there is not the slightest indi
cation of a caucus while the "Colonel"
Is a candidate. Both Burns and Grant
must step aside before a Senator can
be elected. While Burns is talking low
down of forces to augment his strength
some of his supporters are demanding
that his predictions should be made
good without further delay. As one re
marked: "It is well enough to look wise
and promise gains for a week, but when
lt comes to looking wise and doing
nothing else for five weeks, it is time to
call for decisive action."
â¢ Senatorial-candidate-to-be Smith of
Madera County has opened his head
quarters at 611 X street, where he has
spent the evening qualifying his an
nouncement that he is a possibility for
the United States Senate.
Concerning his' candidacy Senator
Smith this evening had this to say:
"As far, as. my vote for United States
Senator goes I shall still cast it for Mr.
Grant, and I hope it will be understood
that until it has become apparent to me
that Mr. Grant's case is hopeless I
shall not consider myself a candidate
for Stephen M. White's position.
"If a break should come I would im
mediately declare myself. My friends
are anxious that I should do so now.
I have canvassed the situation thor
oughly and I can confidently say that
there are a number of votes that will
come to my support.
"Of course, if my constituents desire
that I go actively Into this fight I am
in duty bound to do so, but I do not
want to appear Inimical to the interests
of Mr. Grant. Not yet, anyway." * , v

AN EFFORT TO *
MODERNIZE PRISONS
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 11.â In a bill which he has
lately introduced Assemblyman Milice of
Riverside has given voice to a desire that
is rapidly becoming general throughout
the State to abolish the prison at San
Quentin, eliminate its features as a lying
in hospital for dope fiends and low crim
inals of every type, and establish some
where in the southern part of the State,
away from the Influence of the big cities,
a reformatory builded and conducted on
modern lines. Mr. Milice, with whom
convict economy has been a matter of
deep study and much research, designs
an institution where there shall be some
chance for reform for the man who has
the element of good left in him, and where
there shall be punishment for the incor
rigible who has gone beyond redemption.
Instead of a school where the novice ln
crime is taught opium smoking and the
making of, burglars' tools against the
time when he Is released and obliged to
rustle his own living, Mr. Milice contem
plates an institution wnere men may
learn a trade during their incarceration
that will give them a fair chance when
they are again made free. He proposes
to follow almost exactly the method so
successfully followed in the State of New
York. His bill provides that the Governor
shall appoint five commissioners, whose
duty it shall be to Investigate and report
to the next Legislature the following
points: ; -"
Upon the advisability and desirability
of establishing a reformatory in Southern
California, for the confinement and reform
of prisoners; to ascertain the cost of the
proposed site therof, and, If desirable, to
bond the same, and take such steps as
they may deem necessary to secure the
title thereto.
To prepare sketch plans and specifica
tions for the construction of such reform
atory, and submit the same to the Leg
islature with an estimate of the probable
cost thereof.
To ascertain and report the feasibility
and best method of and for the sale of
the property of the State, real and per
sonal, and the amount which may be real-,
ized from such sale, known as the State
Prison at San Quentin.
To ascertain and report upon the feasi
bility and best method of enlarging the
Folsom Prison, and segregating the pris
oners in the State prisons into classess of
those that are incorrigible, and those that
it may be possible to reform in a reform
atory, and the conflnment of the incorrl
glbles at Folsom, and the probable cost
thereof.
The bill further provides that the com
missioners shall serve without compensa
tion, but that they shall be allowed trav
eling and other expenses incidental to
| their Investigation. . An appropriation of
i $5000 is made to secure a complete report.
The Committee on State Prisons and
Reformatories has the measure under its
consideration.

three rows of seats placed in the back of
the Assembly chamber and that visitors

vote of Mr. Kenneally of San Francisco
against it. ".".-* â â >_â  YÂ£.-:fi

Judge Dibble moved that when adjourn

that there was at the time only a quorum

WORKING FOR THE
NORMAL SCHOOL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â The continuation or ex
istence of a normal school at San Fran
cisco seems to be of considerable interest
to the San Francisco public at present,
for a strenuous effort is being made to
either have the Legislature continue the
Â§ resent city normal school or create a
State normal school there, as the normal
school now in San Francisco will be abol
ished on June 1, 1599, and the hope of the
citizens of the city is to have the* Legi
slature either appropriate the sum of $15,
--000 for this improvement of the present
building and system or have that body
appropriate the sum of $150,000 for the
construction of a State normal school
building on the grounds of the Girls'
High School on Scott street.
Ex-Judge Cooney spoke this afternoon
before the Assembly Committee on Edu
cation, at which he stated that the pres
ent normal school was a much needed
factor to San Francisco, and the abolish
ment of which would be a detriment to
the city and would also hurt the commer
cial interests of San - Francisco. He stated
also that as San Francisco was the larg
est city. in the State it was entitled to
a State normal school much more than
Chico or Los Angeles. The committee
took no action on the matter; but the
consensus of opinion of the committee is
that San Francisco will either be helped
In regard to sustaining the present mu
nicipal school or will have a State normal
school in the city.
A Light Day in the Senate.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 11.â Legislation was at a
discount in the Senate to-day. It lasted
only two hours, anyway, and there was
little of Importance done during the time,
and then just after the joint assembly
the Senate adjourned until Monday at 10
o'clock. It was attempted to make the
hour of convention half-past 11, for it was
believed there would be too many of the
legislators late to make a quorum at 10
o'clock; but an abnormal sense of duty
prevailed, and the Senate adjourned to
the earlier hour.
There were no bills submitted in the
early part of the day's session, but later
on ' the Senators rose to the occasion,
prompted by the anti-advertising message
of the Governor yesterday afternoon, and
submitted a few bills allowing advertising
bills to some of the interior papers. Sen
ator Boyce broke the monotony by Intro
ducing a bill noted elsewhere, and then
the Senate took up the second reading
file, than which there is no more monot
onous piece of statesmanship.
The report of the Committee on Public
Morals came back in favor of adopting
the substitute to the bill to enforce a
"Christian Sabbath," Introduced by Sen
ator Simpson, and the report was adopt
ed. The substitute takes out from the
prohibitions of the act Sunday baseball,
Sunday footoall, Sunday shooting, Sunday
hunting, Sunday, beer drinking and the
closing of certain houses on Sunday which
by law are made objectionable any day in
the week. â  \Y-
To Cut Off Managing Boards. v
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 11.â Senator Boyce is after
the managing boards of the State institu
tions, and if he can he Intends to wipe
them off the State pay roll by a bill ne
Introduced in the Senate this morning.
In his bill he provides for a State ooard
of control, consisting of the Lieutenant
Governor, the Secretary of State, the At
torney General and two others, appointed
by the Governor, one of whom shall be an
expert accountant and the other an archi
tect of at least ten years' practice, both
to be residents of the State for at least
ten years preceding their appointment.
The board shall have full control over
all State institutionsâ charitable, reform
atory and penal. It shall handle all money
and have the entire management of the
various Institutions, even to the appoint
ment of the officers and the fixing of their
salaries. The two members appointed by
the Governor are to serve four years at
an annual salary of $3600. The Lieutenant
Governor will also receive this sum, ex
cept when he is engaged during the ses
sion of the Legislature, with his duties as
president of the Senate.
It is further provided in the bill that at
least once a month the board, by one of
Its members or by Its secretary, shall visit
each one of the insane asylums of the
State, and it must file a biennial report
setting forth the history for the preceding
two years of its charges, with an esti
mate for an appropriation for the suc
ceeding two years and such suggestions
for legislation as may be necessary.
The bill was received and was referred
to the committee on public institutions.
SMALL CIGAR DEALERS
SAVED FROM DISASTER
RUINOUS INTERNAL REVENUE
' â > ' RULING MODIFIED.
Efforts of The Call to Protect Thou
sands of Small Cigar Manu
facturers Were Success
. cessful.
The small cigar manufacturers .of the
country, who were a few Weeks ago de
prived of their livelihood by a ruling of
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
have been made happy by a reversal of
that decision.
> When the announcement was made that
dealers in leaf tobacco could no longer
sell the leaf from the broken package, and
that the manufacturers of cigars must
purchase the original bale, bundle, etc.,
The Call, -knowing the injustice of the
proposition, took up the cudgel in behalf
of these small manufacturers and showed
that on this coast alone, if the ruling were
enforced, about 3000 men would be thrown
out of employment.
It was furthermore demonstrated that
the proposition, whether intentional or not,
was entirely in the interest of the .large
manufacturers. As a result of publish
ing the facts of the situation the commer
cial bodies of the city took the matter up
and sent a dispatch to the Commissioner,
asking that the ruling be modified. After
due consideration the department re
scinded the order to the extent that the
leaf can be sold from the broken package
and be packed in cases or bales instead of
being disposed of loose in hand, as here
tofore. .-'. . C ... y r ' vr y
The new ruling will be a boon to the
manufacturer whose only capital is his
labor, for lt obviates the Infliction of a
cruel hardship upon thousands of honest
workmen on this coast, who otherwise
would have been permanently thrown out
of employment without means to support
themselves and families. As a conse
quence their business will proceed prac
tically on "the old lines. V-"

Second Brigade Signal Corps Gives
a Practical Illustration of the
Working of the New
. Invention.
lhursday night there was an exhibition
In the armory of the Nationals at 15 Ellis
street of a new combination signal cart
for the use of the signal service, the in
vention of Captain Charles L. Hewes,
commanding the signal corps of the Sec
ond Brigade, National Guard of Califor
nia.
The captain, who is very enthusiastic
in signal work, discovered that one of
the great necessities during the recent
war with Spain was the maintaining of
a perfect system of communication be
tween the front and headquarters, and
that to accomplish this the service of the
. signal corps was most essential, and while
It was apparent that the old system of
â¢ flag and heliograph was good in its way,
, the telegraph was paramount as a means
,: -of 'communication.
.". He then devoted his spare time to de
â â¢â  vising a cart that could be used for the
.- â  purpose of running telegraph lines be
.; -tween points, one that would be effective
. ; and practical, one that would not be cum
.-; bersome. and the result of his ideas was
â¢ demonstrated last night before an audi
- tfee in which were Brigadier General
Warfleld; commanding the Second Bri
gade; Lieutenant Colonel Geisting, Lieu
;. . tenant Colonel D. E. Miles, signal officer
.on the division staff; Major Evans, signal

â¢Colonel Sumner (retired). Captain Hanks,

â¢ .and civilians; also a couple of ladies.
. Prior to the exhibition there was a re
â â â  view by the signal corps to the brigadier
".'-.â¢.general, in which the men made a most
â  â :' favorable Impression by their military
.'.precision. This was followed by the build
ing of a signal tower nearly thirteen feet
', in- height of pieces of scantling lashed to
., ;ther, by eight men of the corps under
' direction of a non-commissioned officer, in
â  fourteen minutes. This being accom
â¢ plished, nine men brought In the com

-hundred and fifty pounds. The cart Is a
two-wheeled affair, which was explained
by the inventor, who said:
"I. drew the plans of this cart in the
latter part of October and after consult
ing with Colonel Miles and Lieutenant
Colonel Green, U. S. V., had it built. I
â¢ will say that the ideas involved in Its con
struction are original. Our second class
men are now examined in the use. of the
heliograph, searchlight, wand, flag and

"The cart is made of. seamless drawn
steel tubing, and has thirty-Inch wheels,
with cushion tires with wire spokes like
those of a bicycle. The wheels are" ball
bearing and are so arranged that they do
not require adjusting if removed from the
' cart. The cart will support a weight of
650 pounds,, and when . fully equipped
weighs about 275 pounds. It has live
reels for carrying cable, one of which is
the shoulder kit or knapsack, each reel
holding half a mile of cable or two and
a half miles on the cart. The cable is of
the twin conductor type, and is insulated.

The cart was started, and while It was
moving, one man took a box from it in

enemy. The exhibition showed the cart
to be a useful and practical appliance
that will be of great service to the signal
corps in action, for it can be moved
where an ordinary wagon could not pass,
and it can be drawn by a horse or a cou
ple of men. The cart was critically ex
amined by the military men. particularly
those of the signal service, and they pro
nounced it "all right."
The exhibition concluded with the tak
ing down of the tower in less than eight
minutes.

GREENMAN EXONERATED.
Principal of Lockwood School Ac
quitted ;of Battering Willie
Corte.
OAKLAND, Feb. j 11.â The parents of
pupils attending Lockwood School on the
San Leandro road were jubilant to-day
over the acqultal of the school principal,
C. H. Greenman, charged by Mrs. Minnie
Corte with battering her little son Willie
on January 26 last.
Principal Greenman was tried by a jury
ln Justice Quinn's court in this city to
day. He testified that he had reprimand
ed the boy several times for throwing
stones and afterward lying about it. He
had whipped him with a soft, pl'able
strap on that portion of the human anat
omy that comes in contact with a chair
when one sits down; that the boy cried
before he was 'touched, and that the al
leged bruise on the boy's leg could not
be seen until the dirt had been removed. ,
His testimony was corroborated by the '
teachers and a dozen other witnesses, j
several of whom testined that Mrs.
Cortes reputation was very bad in their
community.
Mrs. Corte had no witnesses except her
self, her son Willie and School Superin
tendent Crawford.
At the request of Deputy District -At
torney George Samuels the Jury was In
structed to acquit, and Principal Green
man was completely, exonerated.

OUR KARA
OF GOLD THAT
POURS EASTWARD
A Million a Week by
Mail Alone.
FORTY-FIVE MILLIONS GONE
PHENOMENAL GOLDEN STREAM
FROM THE GOLDEN GATE.
Millions in Gold Coin Constantly-
Streaming Across the Country
With a Secrecy Born of
. Train Robbers.
An interesting feature of the present
| financial situation in the United States is
that for months past a great, steady and
phenomenal stream of gold coin has been
pouring from the Pacific Coast to the
East over the transcontinental lines of
communication. The Pacific Coast Is
pouring a Niagara of gold Into the lap
of the East.
During the past twelve months over
$45,000,000 In" gold, freshly minted in San
Francisco, has gone East by mall alone
to supply the channels of trade, create
gold reserves in treasury and bank vaults
and to generally cut a large figure in the
financial condition of the nation. This
stream of gold has for months averaged
a million dollars a week, and it is now
even stronger than ever. J But this stream
of wealth has been purposely kept blan
keted with secrecy and no notice of It has
before come to press and public.
The $45,000,000 mentioned includes only
the gold shipped from San Francisco by
registered mail. It does not include any
shipments from San Francisco or any
other Pacific Coast points by express or
otherwise and it does not include many
other smaller eastward streams of gold,
coined or in the shape of bullion. For In
stance, it does not Include the $8,000,000
or thereabouts of Alaskan and other gold
bullion shipped to the East from the new
United States assay office at Seattle. This
one reinforcement raises the actually re
ceived Eastern gold supply from the Pa
cific Coast to about $53,000,000 for the past
twelve months.
The odd thing about it, as far as public
Information is concerned, is that in a
few months $45,000,000 in gold coin has
been sent across the continent by mall
without general knowledge of what was
going on all the time. If the average
citizen wonders what becomes of all the
gold t,hat pours into San Francisco he
probably supposes that it piles up in Gov
ernment or bank vaults here; that occa
sional shipments by express are made, and
that when the gold becomes plethoric
ln the subtreasury vaults here the Gov
ernment will ship East $20,000,000 or bo by
special train with armed guards, as it did
about three years ago.
But the real story is different. For
months there has been an enormous
stream of gold pouring into San Fran
cisco. To the natural flow of gold bullion
from Pacific Coast mines has been added
an unprecedented flow of gold in the
shape of British sovereigns from Aus
tralia. The last steamer from the Antip
odes brought $2,500,000, and that sort of a
gold stream has been flowing to this port
ever since the balance of foreign trade
turned, in favor of America, months ago.
The ways of banking make it cheaper to
a certain large extent to ship gold to
America from Australia. to settle Amer
ican balances than to ship It across the
Atlantic from London, and most of the
Australian gold that comes here Is In
tended to pay commercial debts in the
East. These millions that come by near
ly every steamer right along are con
signed to banks here. The receiving
banks instantly cart the sovereigns to the
mint and sell them at their bullion, value
for American gold coin. The British gold
is at once melted up and coined with the
stamp of the eagle. That great extra sup
ply of British coin has enabled the San
Francisco mint to recently break the
world's minting record for gold coinage
per month. -y i Â .
The story of this receipt of gold has
been told before, but the news always
ends at the receipt. Now, when this Aus
tralian gold gets here and when It is ex
changed at the Mint for American gold
coin it is still in the hands of the bankers,
and it still is due In the East. It is really
minted in transit. The stock of gold at
the Mint and at the Sub-Treasury Is not
swelled. The Australian gold passes on
with hardly a pause. A similar tale could
be told of some millions In Japanese yen.
Then there Is another recent reason for
the flow of Pacific gold eastward. The
Government has in the past few months
paid out millions here on war contracts
in great variety. These payments drain
gold from the Sub-Treasury, and much of
it is due in the East. Payments on war
ships, transports, powder, supplies and
so on are enormous. in the aggregate.
For these and other reasons the east
ward stream of gold has been and re
mains enormous. But few people would
guess that most of this- gold goes by
mall. Uncle Sam cautions fool Americans
against sending money by mail unless it
is registered or goes by postoffice order,
and if it is registered his liability Is lim
ited to $10 per registered package. In the
face of this, $45,000,000 has been sent East
by mail in the past few months, and at
least a million dollars a week is carried
across the continent in mail sacks, to the
chagrin of the express companies.
This is done because it is cheaper. The
gold ls sent as common merchandise un
der the regulations limiting packages to
four pounds. The rate is 1 cent per ounce.
Registration costs 8 cents per package.
The practice is to put a roll of $1000 ln
double eagles in a little round leathern
case, on the side of which Is a panel with
flaps, in which a little card bearing the
address is inserted. This card also re
ceives the stamps. Such a package gen
erally needs 67 cents in stampsâ 50 cent
stamp, a 5 cent, a 4 cent and an 8 cent,
the last the registration stamp. The cases I
are returned like mail sacks. An express
wagon load of such packages is dumped
at the Postoffice, and each is registered.
The precious packages are dumped In
special leathern interior sacks, holding â 
from $25,000 to $50,000 each, and there is
a special outer sack. With Uncle Sam
standing good for $10 per $1000, the boys
hustle the sacks across the continent day
by day.
But the banks do not take any such
risks with wrecks and train robbers. j
Every dollar's worth of gold is Insured j
to reach its destination, and certain in- |
surance companies are eager for the risks. ;
The 67 cents, plus insurance and plus i
drayage, represents the cost of transpor
tation. The total is less than the express
charges, with the express companies lia
ble, and that is why an enormous stream
of gold is going East by mall. It means, i
for one thing, an addition of over $30,000 ,
a year to the Postoffice receipts here.
In these remaining days of train robbers |
it requires no explanation to explain why j
Government officials, bankers and all con- !
cerned wish to say nothing about the i
phenomenal shipments and why the op- '
eration has gone on with such secure
secrecy. But that Is the way San Fran- <
cisco has fed $45,000.0000 in gold to the East
during the past few months.
Assembly Committee on Hand.
BERKELEY. Feb. 11.â The special com- j
mittee of the State Legislature appointed
to visit public buildings and institutions ;
inspected the University of California I
and the State Institution for the Deaf,
Dumb and Blind in Berkeley to-day. The
committee consisted of Assemblymen
Pierce, Bliss. Knowland, McKeen, Hanley, |
De Lancie, Boone, Kelsey and Melice. They
were shown over the university grounds j
and buildings by Regents Andrew S. Hal- '
lidie and E. A. Denlcke, and Professors
William Carey Jones, Carl C. Plehn and
Samuel B. Christy.
DID THEY LOOT
THE SAFE OF THE
OLD LOUVRE?
Three Suspects Un
der Arrest.
POLICE MAINTAIN SECRECY
MEN ARRESTED ARE KNOWN AS
BUNKOERS AND CROOKS.
Papers Found in Possession of One of
Them. Connect Him With a
Bold Diamond Robbery
in Sacramento.
J. C. Miller and Harry Williams werÂ«
arrested last night by Detectives . Gibson
and Wren and lodged In the tanks. Early
this morning Clay Walton was arrested
by Detective Ed Gibson and also held on
the detinue book. â¢
All three men are well known to the po
lice as bunko men and all around croks.
While a strict silence Is maintained on
the subject by the arresting officers it Ib
generally understood that they are want
ed for robbing the old Louvre on January
8 last. At that time $15,000 worth of
stock ln the Champion mine was ab
stracted from the safe as well as $8000
in a promissory note. The stolen prop
erty was afterward mysteriously re
turned at the ferry for a consideration
of $100.
The robbery was a most daring one.
During the busy hours of a Sunday after
noon certain parties visited the saloon,
and when no one was watching rifled the
safe of its contents. It contained no
money and no papers valuable to any
body but their owner.
The thieves, however, took what they
could get, and later one of the proprie
tors of the Louvre received a note In
forming him that he could get the papers
back by sending a man with $100 to tne
ferry depot at a certain hour, when _he
would be met by a man described ln the
note. He did so and got his papers back,
but the detectives have been working on
the trail of the daring safe-looters ever
since. i
Their efforts have at last borne fruit,
and they are confident that the three
men now languishing in the tanks are the
guilty parties. â¢_ "
From the letters found in the room of
one of the men it Is also believed that
he Is connected with a famous diamond
robbery ln Sacramento, when a man was
held up, pepper thrown In his eyes and
valuable jewelry abstracted from his per
i son. ':. y
If the. police can prove half what they
suspect one of the biggest catches of the
' season has been made and a long term
j ln the State Prison awaits the men ar
| rested.

Vein of Decomposed Quartz Found by Men
Excavating for a New
Building.
O VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. Vancouver is in the throes of a O
O gold excitement, due to the discovery' in the heart of the city of de- O
. O composed gold quartz, which expert miners say will go 5200 to the O
â¢O â¢ ton. The find, to say the least, is unique. An immense building, for O
O a small city like Vancouver, is being erected by J. W. Flack, late of O
O California, who recently returned from Dawson City with a fortune O
' O made In the gold mines. It is on Cambia and Hastings streets, and O
O a big excavation Is being made. Yesterday while the excavators were O
O at work they saw glittering yellow flakes resembling gold on their O
.O shovels and picks and reported it to Contractor Mac Donald. The O
. O latter is an old Caribou miner. Warning the men to say nothing, he O
O gathered a small bagful of the deposit, and, taking it home, thoroughly O
O tested it. > O
O One of the workmen to-day told the story to a local reporter. O
O Mac Donald was Interviewed and said there was about two and a half O
. O feet of the vein of decomposed gold quartz, which he believed would O
O average about $200 to the ton. Some of the deposit was' shown to Â©
â¢ O an old Montana miner, at present on his way to Atlin. and he said O
â¢ O it was identical with the quartz at Bear Gulch, Mont., which ran fully O
â¢ O $200 to the ton, and, in some spots, double that amount. O
â¢ O Vancouver is known to be right in the gold belt, and when the O
O story was circulated there was great excitement among mining men. O

UNDERSTANDING
WHO GERMANY
White Is Confident of
Adjusting Troubles.
Copyrighted. 15. 9, by th* Associated Pr___.
â¢ BERLIN, Feb. 11.â The United States
â¢ Embassador, Andrew D. White,' has ,
now received detailed Instructions re- i
garding Samoa, both by mall and cable.
He declined to give their nature, but ]
said:
"I do not see any reason to change
the opinion I have previously expressed
that the difficulties will be entirely ad
. Justed diplomatically. My instructions
have not made the task of coming to an
amicable understanding more difficult.
I have had several conferences with
Baron yon Bulow (the German Minister
of Foreign Affairs) during the week
about Samoa and the Philippines and
Our commercial relations. I found the
German Government very conciliatory."
Mr. White utterly disbelieves the re
ports that Germany has financially sup
ported Aguinaldo and similar stories.
With reference to the latter allegations
a high government official said to the
Associated Press correspondent: "These
reports are utterly baseless. It is true
that a commercial syndicate for the ex- (
port of arms and ammunition has ex- j
isted at Hongkong for years and is still
doing a thriving business. Its mem- â 
bers are English, Americans, Japanese
and Chinese, but it does not contain a
single German. The Consul of Germany
.certainly does not belong to the syndi
cate nor Is he in anyway interested in
the arms and ammunition trade."
. American affairs have occupied a
large space in the German press during
the past week. The events at Manila
have been followed keenly and the
press comments are plentiful and va
ried.
Generally speaking, the papers are
rather sympathetic to the Americans,
but fears are expressed that the task
of subduing the Filipinos will prove
harder than the Americans suppose.
The Vossische Zeitung, in an article
wishing the Americans success, says:
; "If America insists upon establishing a
permanent American rule in the Philip
pines, the United States stand Just on
the threshold of a colonial war of whose
dangers and expense, blood and money
the- American newspaper strategists
have probably no adequate Idea"
The Kreuz Zeitung says: "Whoever
looks over the situation calmly must
admit that the final victory of the
Americans is not only certain, but desir
able. The Tagallos, with their Aguinal
do, are certainly incapable of self-gov
ernment. We are unable to discover in
this Aguinaldo, who has played with
more than hostile intentions between
. two powers, has any traits of real
greatness."
The Kreuz Zeitung then rejoices that
â the relations between Germany and the
[United States are improving, and pays
â¢ a high tribute to Mr. White for his
steady efforts in that direction. The
paper next advises a partition of the
. Samoan Islands, Germany taking the
one upon which Apia, the capital, is sit
uated, and which contains more than
: half the total population of the entire
group, and the United States and Great
Britain dividing Savaii, Tutuilla and
Menua.
..The commercial relations between
the United States and Germany have,
however, absorbed chief attention,
partly on account of the Reichstag In
terpellation on the subject to-day, in
troduced by Count yon Kanltz, the
Agrarian leader, with the approval of
the Government, which hopes thereby
â¢tf>; exert pressure on the Washington
rnment, which, it is claimed here,
lis" hanging back needlessly and inter
' posing obstacles in the way of a mv
; t'ual understanding regarding reci
â¢ pr.ocity.
- .In reply to an interpellation, Minister
.of Foreign Affairs yon Bulow said in
the Reichstag to-day:
â¢'; "As regards the differential treatment
"of .German sugar, apart from the Dlng
. Joy tariff, the German Government ob
jected that this treatment was opposed
"to the most favored clause of the
treaty and that It was a customs
surtax Incorrectly calculated. We
have secured the removal of the
different charges arising from un
fair reckoning of the surtax, but
Germany has a further demand re
specting the deduction of additional ex
cise from the so-called over-contingent
. which ha> been persistently rejected.
On the other hand the American Gov
ernment has promised to consider Ger
many's proposal for the deduction of
the general Industrial tax to which Ger
man sugar is subjected."
NO MORE FAVORITISM

.. SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Feb. 11.-The
â¢ members of the Board of State Prison Di
rectors were in an iconoclastic mood to
day, and the monthly meeting was ren
dered interesting by the pedestals being
knocked from under several time-stained
images of prison custom. Hereafter the
upper strata of criminal society will not
>- srranted favoritism . over Its plebeian
companions and true democracy will reign
ln both the State penitentiaries.
For a long time Warden Hale has fol
lowed the practice of giving the more dis- !
tinguished prisoners, such as embezzlers '
j and absconders, very light work to do I
when they first entered the institution, !
1 borne were made clerks, others bookkeep-
I ers and a particularly favored few were :
I ornaments. The directors evidently have
given this matter serious consideration
or some time, for their action to-day was
unanimous and preceded by little discus- '
sion.
Director Wilkins broke the ice by bring
ing the subject forward and voicing his i
opinion that every new prisoner, no mat- j
ter what his offense or the position he
previously occupied in society, should be
subjected to the severest prison discipline
for a stated time, and forced to labor in
the jute mill or some other department
where hard manual labor is the rule Di
rectors Devlin, Fitzgerald and Ray- !
Hayes being absentâ said the idea met !
with their approval, ana the Warden '
was Instructed to adopt this procedure In
the future.
Warden Hale was instructed to prepare i
plans and figures for a ward for incor- '
ngibles in the old furniture factory of the |
prison. These will be presented at the I
next meeting of the board. Heretofore the j
plan has been to place the prison "cranks" j
in a row of cells known as "Crank Alley,"
! and in order to preserve discipline they
: have been kept away from the other con
victs. This action was due in great meas- i
, use to the interest taken In the subject ;
j by the State Lunacy Commission.
It was practically determined to hear
I applications for parole only at quarterly i
I meetings, beginning with the April session I
of each year. There was also some dis- !
; cussion of the proposition to change the I
parole rules and make them more definite I
1 Nothing was done along these lines, but â 
; it is probable that at a future meeting the ;
j board will make a set of rules convicts |
I must live up to for a given time before j
applications for parole will be heard at
all.
It was further concluded to be neces- I
i sary that some system be devised by I
which exceptionally well-behaved prison- ;
! ers may be given more credits than are 1
now accorded them. This proposition has I
been an especial hobby of Director "Wil
kins and a new set of credit rules doubt
less will be in vogue in a short time.
WORK OF SCHLEY
AND SAMPSON
Long's Communication
to the Senate.
Epet'al Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON*, Feb. 11.â Secretary
Long has sent to the Senate an ex
| haustive report in reply to -the resolu
j tion recently passed by that body call
ing upon the Navy Department for all
records ln its possession upon which
the nominations of Admirals Sampson
and Schley to their present grades were
based. This resolution was passed in
executive session.
Secretary Long goes into the naval
history of the Spanish war at great
length, citing orders, movements and
all the details which preceded the bat
tle of July 3. In summing up the facts
and citing the reasons for the advance
ment of Schley and Sampson, he says:
"The advancement of Admiral
i Sampson was proposed in recognition
of his services in the execution of his
j duties as commander in chief of our
j ships engaged in the campaign in the
West Indies; for the supervision of
all the ships wherever distributed: for
the blockade of the island of Cuba; for
convoying and landing of army and co
operation with its movements, and for
the pursuit, blockade and destruction of
the Spanish fleet, which destruction on
the 3d of July by our fleet under his
command was the consummation of his
orders and preparations beginning on
the Ist day of June. In this connection
the dispatch of Commodore Schley,
dated July 10, ls a pertinent fact.
"The advancement 'of Commodore
Schley was proposed in recognition of
his services as next in rank with the
victory at Santiago. Where so much
was achieved in this culminating bat
tle and where his ship was so conspic
uous a force in the fight, his conduct
while in Independent command prior to
June 1, the report of which has been
given and which, by reason of its un
steadiness in purpose and failure to
obey orders, did not meet the approval
of the President, the department did
not permit it to stand in the way of
his nomination for promotion to a high
er grade for the part he took in that !
final triumph. In this connection as a i
pertinent factor is the letter of Admiral ]
Sampson, in which, while not overlook
ing Commodore Schley's conduct above I
referred to, he asked that ample justice i
be done him for his part in the action
of July 3.
"It is just to both these officers to j
say that each of them was selected for I
his command ln the war without solici
tation or suggestion on the part of him
self or any one in his behalf. The head '
of the department, under the approval
of the President, is responsible for these
selections, which were made in the ex
igencies of the war situation and in the
exercise of the department's discretion
in the assignments which are author
ized by law. This discretion was ex
ercised solely with a view of the best
Interests of the public service, whether
wisely or not, results show.".
Cuban Soldiers Offended.
HAVANA, Feb. 11.â The Cuban generals 'â

funeral procession of General Garcia j
withdrew to-day, because they were not 1
allowed to march between Governor Gen- j

THE JOURNALISTIC GUNNER.
IN his pursuit of the newspapers Senator Morehouse
is developing talents which if directed into proper
channels might elevate him to a " conspicuous
position in the history of â  his country. â¢ He' has intro
duced a bill providing an open season for newspaper
men â that is to say, he proposes.* that when news
paper . men are killed by irate subscribers or indig
nant readers, the fact" that there was published an*"
article calculated to anger anybody may be intro
duced in evidence in mitigation or in justification of
the crime. Of course the privileges extended by this
â¢ bill would not be developed entirely to the detriment
cf journalists.. Undoubtedly lawyers, politicians and
other citizens would suffer under it; for it is not to
be supposed that newspaper men would tamely sub
mit to being shot down in their tracks every time
i . suited anybody, to nurse a grievance against them.
But .the. radical defect in the bill, as Senator More
house has discovered, "consists in the difficulty of
identifying gentlemen of the press. At the present
time journalism in California is to .a large extent im
personal. Writers do not' sign â¢ their â¢ articles, but
everything is carried forward- in the name of the pro
prietor at the head of the., editorial page.. In other
words, the proprietor is supposed to be responsible
â¢ for even-thing published in the paper. ' v':V "
Since,: under Mr.' Morehouse's bill, there would be
but one. man to kill, he has introduced a measure de
. signed to uncover, the entire brood of unhappy jour- |
' nalists. This bill requires the writer of every article
which criticizes or attacks to append his name to it. :
â¢Any proprietor who fails to have such articles signed
' in his paper may be fined heavily for his laches.
.'.'"This measure completes the system inaugurated by j
â¢the original open season bill. It makes the identifi- ;
cation of offending journalists, easy and complete, and
upon knowing who they are, aggrieved persons need
only call at the office and inquire for them. Imme
diately Upon their appearance they may be shot down
with impunity, it- being only necessary in order to
:" secure acquittal afterward to prove in court that the
'shooter was angry
. It is really interesting that Senator Morehouse
. should have had his legislative ingenuity aroused by
.the press. i He was not so bad two years ago. when he
. had a grievance. Then the papers did their best to
.-make him famous, and yet he refrained entirely from
â¢. introducing a bill to regulate them. Now, when no
â¢ body is paying the slightest attention to him â in fact,
When his name is left entirely out of the papers and
when all the scribblers regard him as a dead bird,
scarcely worth noticing is out with rifle and shot
gun, running down journalists, and inventing
. measures for their immediate and general slaughter.
'. We do not understand the line upon which the mind
of the honorable Senator is working.

AMERICAN IDEAS.
TiHE bottom ideas of- Our fabric of government
'are the Declaration of Independence, the con
, stitution , and, the contemporaneous, expressions
of- the Fathers of the republic, .with Washington at
\ . the head. The Farewell Address of that greatest of
. founders of nations is next in importance to the in
struments it so faithfully interprets. We have before
... ...quoted the expression , of St. Chrysostom, "The true
. . : ..Shekinah is man." This sentiment was the inspira
:;.'". tion of our Revolution, and of the institutions so
. .; carefully formulated to protect its results and to pro
â¢ vide for, our development in all future ages. A peo
'.'.' . pie who lose reverence for the indestructible
... .-'Thought that underlies their history have lost their
- self-respect and, cut loose from their anchorage,
. without helm or ballast, toss on the waves of crude
â¢ '. theories and undefined aspirations in which shallow
;. ness and selfishness predominate. Their only hope
.'â¢ - then lies in the. ultimate .repugnance of mankind to
quackery and falsehood, and in the tendency to re
.'â¢ . vert' to such great truths as are incorporated, for in
stance, in our political system. As Carlyle has ex
â¢ -.* pressed it, "The confused wreck of things, crumbling
'â¢ . â¢' and even crashing and tumbling all round us in these
â¢ . revolutionary ages." will get down' so far; no
farther. =It is an eternal cornerstone .rom which
they can begin to. build themselves up again." But
y how deplorable a spectacle it would be for a nation
\'} or a community to.be undone and for the work of
rebuilding it to be necessitated by ignorance, by pas
sion, by ambition, ,or by cupidity lb
The THOUGHT of "Americanism and' the
THOUGHT, of imperialism will not harmonize. They
, â¢ can neither be welded nor incorporated. One or the
other must prevail. - .. ...:bb.. ..:.. ... b'y>* r

THE GOVERNOR ON BUGS.
THE veto of a bill to appropriate $10,000 for se
curing the introduction of benign insects to prey
, upon the enemies of our vines and fruit trees
will not command the support of our horticultural in- â¢
terests. It is somewhat unfortunate that the verbiage
of the bill seems to have left the Governor in doubt
whether the noxious insects to be exterminated were
-,
such as beset man and beast or attack vegetables
only. A slight extension of the executive knowledge
of entomology, even a reference to his own juvenile
experience, would have recalled to him the fact that
such insects as prey upon man are within easy reach
of a fine comb and the red oxide of mercury. bb'4
If he will go back to the time when every orange
orchard of Southern California looked as if each tree >
were the evaporating pipe of an artificial ice plant/so.
( bestudded were they with the white cottony cushion,
â¢scale, he will be convinced that their salvation was not
within the reach of a fine comb and red precipitate.
In this retrospect he will gain some knowledge of the
difference between the animal and vegetable king
doms when it comes to insects.: *.. ' y...
The late Frank McCoppin was the means send
ing to Southern California the Vedalia Australis, that
gentle ladybug with an appetite for the white ' scale,
which cleared the orange orchards of Mr. Gage's sec
tion and saved.it from bankruptcy. â *â¢ '.*â '.' y. â [ â¢ Â»
Of late, if the Governor will read the papers, he will
learn that Continental Europe has suddenly cut off a 1
growing and profitable trade in the dried fruits of
California because of the liability to inoculation with
the San Jose scale, an insect enemy of orchards that
has wrought them more evil than St. Paul suffered at
the hands of Alexander the coppersmith.
It is a matter that merely affects the market value
of over two hundred million pounds of prunes and
other dried fruits. Entomology teaches that insect
tribes live on each other. The Vedalia Australis
would not in any famine or stress of weather do harm
to an orange tree. But when the sap thereof has fat
tened the cottony cushion scale, the Vedalia invites
her friends to dinner, and that scale is the piece de
resistance. So general is this law that it is perfectly
certain that in the home of all these insect enemies of
California horticulture, the Pacific islands, there is a
tribe waiting to take up arms against the San Jose
scale, and the transportation of such an army of in
vasion is cheap at $10,000.
The Governor should- visit San Jose or talk with
some of the Northern Califorhians engaged in de
ciduous horticulture, and learn that their interests are
not such as deserve the indulgence of executive pleas
antry and refusal to distinguish between the scale and
common lice. ' - â¢ â¢
This State has millions embarked in fruit culture,
but the same climate which is kind to tree and vine
is clement also to the pests that prey upon them. It
is to be hoped that the Governor will not continue to
appear as attorney. for the San Jose scale. \
THE -COMING DEFICIENCY.
THE statement by Chairman Cannon of the
House- Committee on Appropriations, the -sup
plementary statements of other Republican Rep
resentatives, and the treasury reports, point to a com
ing condition of fiscal affairs which requires Â«the im
mediate attention of those in authority. A year ago
this Congress forced the President's, hand in the
Spanish war. The people appeared to be "behind it,
and prudence in forecast and careful counting of the
cost in . advance were > not in public â¢ favor. â¢ Now,
however, the leaders. who were hoarsely shout
ing for ' the ' taking of - the . first step bare
not so : much in evidence. :'.' The auxiliaries
of the Cuban Junta in all ," our â¢ large cities,
and the young ladies in the New York Art School,
who wired the President, "To hell with diplomacy,"
are at present indifferent spectators of the complica
tions and the waste of national wealth and energy
precipitated by their unthinking rashness. The mi
nority in Congress, including that verbose and vocal
warrior, Lentz of Ohio, boasted that it had forced
j the President and the Republican party " into war.
i Less than a year ago they were shouting in Con
i gress, "This is our war; it is a Democratic war."
j At present they are engaged in viewing with alarm
j the fact that their war has cost a lot of millions and
I promises to cost a great many more, overrunning the
| resources of the treasury under our present rate of
I taxation. That they had ulterior motives a year ago
j is proved by their current threat that there will come
| another Congress like the fourth,, which will
j apply the pruning-knife to taxes.
It is not a far cry back to the Cleveland adminis
tration when these same men were in the majority in
I the House and were rabidly trying to force Him into
1 this same war. Had an incident like the destruction
| of the Maine occurred at that time they would have
j then lighted the bale.fires from ocean to ocean.
. The war for which they shrieked is still on and is
growing more costly, and while one wing of them at
tacks the administration on the score of expense the
other reddens its neck and yells every time the ad
ministration shows signs of hunting a place to stop.
Dealing with such a minority and saddled with daily
increasing costs growing out of the war, the Repub
lican party needs the wisdom of its wisest to steer
safely through" the complications that are upon it. y'f
It is well to face at once the situation. If the rev
| enues are deficient, the amount required to meet. ex
penses should be estimated and immediate provision
| made for it, and for it all, to the end that the coun
try may know at once the measure of its burden.
Nothing but harm can come of indecision, or trusting
to luck, or counting upon a sustained war enthusiasm.
These men wanted the United States to be "a
world power" a year ago, and they are now biting
their thumbs at the Republican party on account of
j the cost of dancing, in that set. Cool men foretold
! what is now upon us. Porto Rico, Guam, the Philip
| pines, were regarded as valuable national possessions
i by these critics of the administration,, but cool men
' knew that these could not be coined into cash to put
j into the treasury. That must be replenished by taxes
| laid upon our people, or it must be let go empty and
broke to supply another minority argument on the
enormity of injuring the national credit

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1899.
IN a report presented to the Assembly on Monday
last the Committee on Ways and Means stated 1
that up to date appropriation bills had been re
ferred to it proposing to disburse the enormous sum
of $3,069,000, A large number of these bills, judged
by . their titles, contain claims, others propose the
construction of monuments to our great men, the
building of roads through various counties, the im
provement of public buildings, the purchase of fur
niture for State officials and the enlargement and im
provement of the insane asylums and prisons.
> The committee has reported back a number of
the .bills unfavorably. These recommend the dis
bursement of a k total; of $112,000. One bill, proposing
to establish a Normal School in San Francisco and
carrying an expeffdltUre of $150,000, has been re
ferred to the Committee on Education. Another, ap
propriating $125,000 for the maintenance of the Pres
ton School of '-Industry, has been withdrawn. â  But
the. total before the Assembly is given as we have
stated it. These figures, however, do not include the
regular biennial .appropriations for the support of
the State government, which for the two succeeding
-fiscal years will pVobably aggregate $10,000,000.
Thus we .have; presented to us a financial prospect
j that is ,; simply. appalling. -jlf < the Legislature ap
propriates one-half the -'money which "is contained in
these bills the tax rate for the fifty-first and ; fifty
'second : fiscal years will come very near to being
70 cents on the $190. Vâ¢' "b .. ff'*y
It would seem to a casual observer that measures
for enforcing economy ought to be at once inaugur
ated at Sacramento. The mere introduction of these
bills indicates that a sentiment prevails among mem
bers entirely hostile to the taxpayers. Undoubtedly
every claim bill has a good argument behind it, and
probably all the psoposed appropriations can be sup
ported by knock-down facts. But, nevertheless,
somebody ought to put on the brakes, for the tax
paying classes can survive no such raid as this.' The
State could easily be financially swamped during the
next two years by the passage of all these bills. -
Besides, to carry out this raid would send the Re
publican party glimmering. No political organization
could stand the enactment of laws appropriating
$15,000,000 at. one session of, the . Legislature! . The
disbursement of $10,000,000 would be bad enough.
WHILE Lord Charles Beresford in his inter
view with The Call declared his purpose in
visiting this country to be the acquirement Of
information from our commercial bodies rather than
the expression of his own views, he, nevertheless, out
of the fullness of his knowledge of , Oriental trade,
made many statements from- which we can gather
profitable lessons.
In the course of his talk he said: "American trade
and commerce is going up by leaps and bounds, but
there is no security for it now and none for future
development. To give you an idea of American
trade, I can. state that; during the last ten years the
importation of American cotton' has increased in
quantity 121 per cent, and in value 59% per cent.
English cotton has decreased in quantity 13^ per
cent, .and' in value 5J.-_ per cent. English trading in
terests do not suffer in China, so far as English mer
chants are concerned, because the English merchant
buys the American cotton and ships it to China in
British bottoms, where it is sold to the Chinese."
In this statement the notable point is that the large'
percentage^ increase in the consumption ofA'rrier.
can cotton in China does not imply a corresponding
increase of American trade direct with that country,
because British merchants p'ui'cha.e- the cotton and
ship it to China. in British vessels. On all-cotton
goods handled in that way the greater portion of the
profit of course goes to the British. Could any
stronger argument be put forth in favor of an imme
diate extension of our merchant marine?
There is, no reason in natural law why cotton pro
duced in the United States should find its -.way to
China through the medium, of British commerce.
With the modern methods ; of packing cotton it can
be handled cheaply by railroads, and cotton from our
Southern States ought therefore to be brought by
rail to San Francisco and shipped from here in Ameri
can vessels not to China only but to 'all Pacific Ocean
countries. That is the natural course of such trade
and it would be followed but for the excessive freight
rates of the railroads and the lack' of a well supported
American merchant marine on the Pacific.
The recent energy displayed in the western exten
sion of the Santa Fe system promises the early es
tablishment of a competitive i system of transconti
nental freights which will bring about a reduction in
rates, but that will be only half the battle. The Brit
ish will still have the 'advantage of a merchant marine
liberally supported by the Government and operated
with comparatively-cheap labor, for the wages of Brit
ish seamen are far below the standard paid oh Ameri
can ships. Our merchant marine. will never :be able
to compete with that of European nations until the
Government - gives it the ,'same protection and, sup
port accorded to other ' American industries.. ' The
moral' of Lord Beresford's statement i should be
heeded by Congress when it comes to vote on the
shipping bill. ....-.', y^'y.y"'" ." I,

I have often wondered at "Town Top

In its colurrms there is a marked dis
play of ability. In many points of cur
rent interest Its opinions are clearly
defined, and in terms lucid and scholar
ly. Yet throughout, its sanity, is inter
spersed with bits of low and vicious
personal gossip, flings at respectability,
innuendoes it has not the courage to
formulate into direct charges, and.
which being formulated would have no
place save in a despicable and loath
some sheet devoted to blackmail. Its
jokes are a stench, and its stories for
the most part breathe the spirit of the
degenerate, the libertine and the bawd.
Altogether, its good features do not off
set the l^ad. ' "Puck," "Judge" and
"Life" are clean, but they are narrow
and provincial. Certainly, the field is
not fully occupied, and a weekly con
ducted on a broad plane, wholesome,
and without a tendency to bend the ed
itorial knee, treating the poor man as
the rich, and the politician as the ras
cal he generally is, ought to find a
ready and ample support.

It is hard to understand how this ad
ministration can afford to pose as
shielding the contractors who sold bad
beef to the Government for the use of
soldiers in time of war. If there has
been such a crime committed, and the
evidence seems to point to it, each con
tractor is a traitor, and each official in
any manner standing between him and
exposure is a most unmitigated scoun
drel, of whose presence the administra
tion should be glad to be rid. There
ought t*o be a court-martial of General
Miles. He has made charges which he
should be forced to prove, or he should
be turned In disgrace from the army.
Individually, I believe the charges to
be , true. I believe that public affairs
are honeycombed with knavery, â¢ and
that a rascal with money can add to
his unholy .store . by methods such as
would send a poor man to stripes and
a cell. I believe that the partial re-,
teritlon.of Eagan ' is . a disgrace, that
Alger is unworthy of confidence, and
that the only reason Miles is not called
upon, or at least so reluctantly,, called
upon, to substantiate his accusations,
is that he is. known to be able to dp so.
To my mind,* the fact that a politician
is competent to write a large check and
chooses to make lt payable to the treas
urer â¢'. of a campaign committee \is - no ,
reason why he should be given high
office, . nor why, after he , has demon- !
strated his unfitness \ for a place of
trust, he should not be kicked out. If
this government has reached the stage
at which it can ignore such serious
charges as those brought by the rank
ing general of the army, it is as. rotten
as the canned offal by which our sol-,
diers in Cuba were poisoned,* and will'
go to smash, not on the rock of impe

suicide, so that the Morehouses of the

Governor Gage will . likely, have a
chance to make a great hit by
vetoing the cartoon bill. It is a I
silly measure, born of the spleen j
of Johnson, thrust forward by the gul
libility of Works, and if passed, will be
carried through by the asininity of the
majority in both houses. The bill, even
If made a law, would have no effect be
yond bringing ridicule upon everybody
stupid enough to sanction it. The Gov
ernor should spare himself, though in
doing so he would also spare a lot of
fatuous guys who do not deserve the
consideration.

On one occasion of dire emergency
Garfield exclaimed: "God reigns and the
government at Washington still lives."
The impressive mien of the orator and
his sonorous voice brought a sense of
confidence. Later, when the great and
good Hanna was elected to the Senate
by the untrammeled votes of unpur
chasable legislators, he paraphrased the
words of Garfield, and happening to
possess a telegraph frank, put upon the
wires the Immortal message: "God
reigns and the Republican party still
lives." Now ln the new crucial test
through which the country is passing
uprises an editor to soothe and sustain
the soul of the commonwealth. At the
head of one of his papers recently the
anxious eye fell upon words of comfort,
and lo! care fled afar and apprehension
winged Its flight from things of state
to perch upon the prune crop, for thus
the announcement was:
b. } y " "THE EXAMINER,
"W. R. Hearst.
:â¢ b ;_ "WHY
SHOULD THERE
BE ALARM?"
Why, indeed? And the careless coun
try, absorbed in selfish brooding over
the wreck of tradition and the shatter
ing of policy, had not even noticed the
buffer, standing serene and yet impla
cable between itself and fate. Let us
keep right on expanding, for at the out
most rim of our protuberant vitality
there Hearst will be, and if we bump
against a circumstance, he must bear
the force of the blow, while the rest of
the United States will hardly . be con
scious of a jar. This is -fine, and noble.

For an exhibition of nerve, the action
of certain billposters ln suing the city,
is almost equal to that of the late
Board of Education In. objecting to go
ing to jail. It seems that the bill
boarders claim the right to erect their
shoddy slabs to any height, so that the
passer-by on a windy day may receive
a plank on the pate coming so far that
he will never know what struck him.
The city, on the other hand, asserts that
the passer-by has a right to protection,
in that he ought not to be hit with a
plank falling more than twelve feet. I
willingly leave the settlement of the
controversy to the courts, commending
the advertising public in the meantime
to so dispose of its announcements that
the bill board may be abolished ' alto
gether, as it is not pretty to look at,
and beyond obstructing the view serves
no possible purpose. .f; : . . . f./f,

. The people of San Francisco are will
ing to support the schools. They give
liberally for this purpose 'and' never
grumble. But the money which should
have Wen used for the schools has been
stolen. Such wanton thievery has sel
dom gone unpunished since the days of
Tweed. Yet Ido not observe any of the
majority of the late board on the way
to jail. The Wallers', the Ragans and
.the rest of the crew walk the streets
unmolested by the police. Men who
pick pockets are not more despicably,
criminal, and - men who break into
houses by night are morally superior.
The teachers of- this city have been,
robbed. I do not refer, to the new teach
ers who were added to the list during
the closing orgies of the putrescent I
gang, but faithful and tried instructors, j
worthy of their hire. ' There ; are teach- : j
ers who go about their duties ' now [
bravely, but who are face to face with I
want. They cannot pay rent nor the ;
ordinary cost of living. They are actu- j
ally suffering, because, there is a limit; j
to the credit that the tradesman can *
extend. â  The city 'owes' these teachers j
months and months of salary- The j
condition is shameful and outrageous, a I
reproach to the municipality. I do not'
know. what 1 can- be done about it, but,
were I one of victims some of the !
thieves would go to the morgue, and
I would rely upon the manhood of the
jury, to bring In a verdict of justifiable
homicide. In the meantime, it is not,
too much to ask that tradesmen be as
lenient as possible. Sooner or later they
will get their pay. The school teachers
are not of the kind who sell their war
rants to more than one broker. They !
are honest people, wherein they hold a !
distinct advantage over the ribald and :
characterless creatures who . , have j
wrought them Injury, lined their own I
pockets and escaped all punishment:

My remarks concerning a Sunday law
do not seem to have pleased everybody
who read them, but I am* gratified to
know they pleased people of sense;
since I do no writing for the benefit of
the ; feeble-minded. A Sunday ' law:
would be the embodiment of arrogant
presumption. It would recall those good
old days, when that unspeakable beast.
Cotton - Mather, and another black
hearted , murderer, the Rev. Samuel
Parrish', were acting as judges and ex

Out of all the clamor and turmoil at
Sacramento comes the great truth that
Senators must be elected by the Peo
ple. I do not write with any consid
eration of the merits of the various
candidates, nor of the possible out
come/having said on these points all
there Is to say, and most of it twice at
least. The fact is evident that an As
sembly even if not directly purchasable;
is made up of men who are under such
personal obligations that they cannot
Ignore them. They are put in an
anomalous position, for they are. in
honor' bound to vote for the best man
available, and they are in honor bound
to stand by their friend, who may not
be the best man. The result is a dead
lock, possibly a scandal, and the ulti
mate selection of one who is unfit. I
do not rise to the lofty point <Â£ con
demning a legislator who standsT>y his
friend. Such conduct may be an im
propriety, but if a legislator I would be
guilty of it myself, being only an aver
age citizen. Therefore I believe the
power of election should be taken from
the Legislature as much for its own
protection as .for the morality of the
law-making body and the conservation
of the character of the national Sen
ate. If selection were by popular vote
there would seldom be a mistake and
there would never be Corruption. ' . A
poor man would have a chance, brains
would count more than money, and the
legislator could . attend to his duties
without being subject to temptation
and without the suspicion of being in
the hire of an aspirant. The change
cannot be too quickly brought about.
In a dozen States the demonstration
has been made that the time is ripe,
j and over-ripe, for it.yr_

! to-night to commence, fixing the water
! rates for the next fiscal year. All the
members of the Council were present, and
; the farce proceeded as in former year?.
I It is known that the members favorable
j to the.water combine have been furnished
with an ordinance and also that the other
\ five members have held several meetings
at the house of Councilman CuvelUer and
; have practically reached a decision in the
matter. Manager "Watkinson of the Con
tra Costa Water Company was present,
but Mr. Dlngee excused himself over the
: telephone on account of the grip.
Mr. Watkinson went over the familiar
I grounds. Water is scarce, rates are too
low, the company pays no dividends and
I he would not Invest in water stock if
I stock were given him. He has heard of ;
no objections, except from rich people
with large lawns and many horses. He !
said that since the last raise in rates I
several taxpayers had expressed their sat
i isfaction with the price of water.
Mr. Woodward smoothed the way for
Mr. Watkinson, but Mr. Upton ruffled the
â¢ Contra Costa man's feathers. He wanted
! to know many things and Watkinson lost
j his temper and told Upton that he should
j pay attention and not be so inquisitive
| There were several little tilts during the
I evening, but never with Mr. Woodward,
: who seemed to desire Just the kind of in
formation that Watkinson most delighted
j to give. .
Watkinson was annoyed at Mr. Rowe
[ when the latter said that President'
Pierce had told him (Rowe) less than a
year ago that the Contra Costa Com
i pany could supply Oakland for three
| years if It did not rain a drop. Watkin
son said this was not so and that his
company could not supply the whole city
at this time. When Mr. Watkinson was
asked why there should be at this time
such a big rise ln Contra Costa stock he
replied that all the crazy men were not
yet dead. Very little definite Information
was obtained and the committee ad
journed till next Wednesday evening.

BARKENTINE
WRESTLER WAS
VERY LUCKY
Ex-Convict Nipped on
the Balmoral.
THIEVES COVETED BLANKETS
JEWELRY STORE NEAR THE
FRONT VANDALIZED.
Battleship lowa Open for Inspection

ley to Have New Pro
pellers.
The barkentine "Wrestler arrived from
Kahulul yesterday after a fair run ol
sixteen days. Captain Nielson sailed her
in through the heads with a good breeze,
but off Fort Point the wind fell light and
the vessel drifted up the bay with the
tide. At one time she was dangerously
near to Shag rock, but, luckily, a puff
of wind carried her out of trouble, and
then the captain decided to anchor.
The Wrestler had a somewhat similar
experience to the Roderick Dhu. The first
few days out from Kahulul the vessel
rushed through the water before a fair
wind, but off the coast nothing but con
trary winds were encountered.
The British ship Balmoral . sailed for
Portland to load wheat for Europe yes
terday. The vessel arrived here in Oc
tober last after having been ln collision
with the British ship Glenericht off Cape
Horn. The Glenericht was so badly dam
aged that she had to put back to Monte
video, where she was afterward sold by
the underwriters. The Balmoral came ou
to San Francisco, and for the last two
months has been at the Union Iron Works
undergoing repairs.
Before getting away Officers Shaw and
McGowan of the Harbor Police went
aboard the Balmoral and arrested an
ex-convict named Martin Brady on a
charge of grand larceny. Brady was
aloft helping to bend the sails when he
saw the police boat coming. He Imme
diately slipped down a backstay and took
refuge in the vessel's fore peak. It took
the ship's crew and the two officers near
ly an hour to unearth the ex-convict. .
A few weeks ago Brady saw a bale of
blankets, belonging to Brown Bros., ly
ing in front of the Gibraltar Warehouse.
The warehouseman was away at lunch,
so Brady loaded the bale of blankets onto
a hand truck and trundled it along San

A court of Inquiry sitting at Hongkong
has suspended Captain William Pithie of
the British steamer Glenavon for one
year. The Glenavon left " Hongkong on
December 29 for England . with a very
large cargo of rice and tea. ! When out a
short time she ran on a rock, but was aft
erward backed off. Before she could be
beached she went down and Chief Of
ficer William Dixon, Quartermaster Will
iam Smith, Second Steward Frank Wil
son and a Chinese fireman were drowned.
The court praised the captain for the
manner in which he had handled matters
after the vessel struck, but suspended him
because of careless navigation. Second
Engineer Robert Boyd was warmly
praised for standing by his engines until
the fires under the boilers were drowned

day will be limited to the capacity of the
launches in the bay. The executive of
ficer of the battleship announced yester
day that no tugs would be allowed along
side, and in fact no craft of any descrip
tion larger than a launch. Yesteraay att

from the man-of-war took the legislators |
from the Markham to the lowa and back
again when the visit was over. The mem

THE "TALENT"
SURPRISED AT
INGLESIDE
Lady Emma Beat Con
nemara Badly.
A GOOD DAY'S COURSING
HARES LEAD THE HOUNDS
MANY EXCITING CHASES.
Olympus Beat Susie and Old Glory
Lost to St. Michael;
in a Long ?
Course. Â
The first run-down of the open stakes
was run off at Ingleside Coursing Park
yesterday afternoon. Though the weather
was none too fine the dogs and hares ran
well, and the spectators were treated to
somo unusually enjoyable sport. The sur
prise of the day was * the defeat of Con
nemara, Jimmie Deane's crack hound, by
Lady Emma, against whom odds of 8 to
1 were laid by the "talent." Lady Emma
led throughout the course, scoring seven
teen points to Connemara's five.
For a star performer Connemara made
a miserable course. Her heart-breaking
course with Rathbone, who died two
hours after the race which took place a
few weeks ago, probably sapped the gin
ger out of Connemara. At any rate that
is the only way her poor showing can be
accounted for. The hares which were
turned loose were exceedingly fleet, and
they led the dogs merry chases all over
the field.
Olympus, at 6 to 1, beat Susie. Nearly
everybody thought the latter dog had an
easy thing of the course. Old Glory lost
to St. Michael in an exciting course that
lasted fully two minutes. The ties will be
run off to-day, and as there are some ex
citing courses in prospect a large crowd
will probably attend.

A Second Broadside Against the Men of
Pills, Potions and Purgatives.
The Energetic Promoter of Dr. Sanden's Great
Electro-Medical Invention Determined to
Fight to a Finish.
The readers of THE CALL were last week treated to an advance
copy of a circular that Dr. McLaughlin, the Western representative of
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt, was about to address to the physicians of
this city and coast. The following hasslnce been received for publication:
702 Market St., San Francisco, Feb. llth, 1899.
TO THE PHYSICIANS OF THE PACIFIC COASTâ Gentlemen: It
was without my personal knowledge and desire that this paper
published a circular letter I was about to address to you. The
publication, however, obviates the necessity of sending It.
Now that the ( ball has been started rolling lam willing to
bowl It further along. I again ask: What have you* to say?
Have 1 stated the case correctly? Are you trying to suppress Dr.
Sanden's invention for the benefit of humanity? or Is It on account
of the narrow, selfish fear that your incomes are in danger? How
much longer do you suppose you can keep the world in ignorance
of what can be done for human suffering by this practical method
of applying vital electricity? Is not your policy shortsighted?
After thousands have obtained relief by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
will not the knowledge thereof gradually percolate through all
strata of the community? And are you not driving nails Into your
own. financial coffins? b . .
' The prudent policy would be to accept the Inevitable grace-
fully and co-operate with the new order of things. I make no
claim that Dr. Sanden's apparatus can supplant all medicines and
all doctors. You are daily saving people from premature death *
or chronic Invalidism by prompt and proper medication, and you
must always continue to do so. The one and only practical ap-
plication of electric currents Is not advertised as a cure for all
diseases. Its principal efficacy Is against troubles of a chronic
nature and of the nervous system, in which, as you know, drugs
are a notorious failure. But even in these cases It must be used
.under directions of a competent physician. These directions I am
now compelled to Issue direct from my office, upon diagnosis
made upon careful statements of patients. You would be Justified
. In asking a fee for prescribing and directing the use of Dr. San-
den's Electric Belt. I must admit, however, that you would often
have but one fee where now you have ten or a hundred.
But can such considerations cause you to Ignore your
plain duty?
Come! Be manly and honest to yourselves! Is It not better
to face a disagreeable situation and make the most of It, rather
. than to avoid it until It grows much worse?
And, leaving out this point of view, have you the HEART to
cause your afflicted fellow-creatures an expense of $50 or $100
when perhaps one-tenth of that amount will secure the restoration
of health through electricity?
It is true that such morals are common In the commercial
world. Many a tradesman will sell an article at the very best â 
price he can get, 'even though a competitor may be offering the
same thing for one-half or one-third as much. It's all right as
long as the buyer doesn't know. But is there not a higher, more
dignified standard for the medical profession ? Respectfully,
dr. m. a. Mclaughlin.

MET AT THE DOOR
BY A LOADED GUN
AN UNWELCOME STRANGER AT
JOHN DUFFEY'S HOME.
His Wife Had Gone and Left Behind
Her a Dangerous Burglar
âTrap.
John Duffey, a bartender, who until a
few days ago, was employed in a saloon
on Kearny street, had a narrow escape
from death by a trap, set, as he believes,
by his own wife. *
Duffey has for many fears been earn
ing his living as a drayman. Business re
verses finally forced him to look to some
thing else for a livelihood and he finally
procured employment as a bartender.
About eight months ago he made the ac
quaintance- of and married a girl from
the tenderloin generally known. as Eva.
Her . true name is a mystery, but it is
known that she has wealthy relatives in
France. â 
The marital relations of the young cou
ple were at first most amicable. "Jack"
ls one of the handsomest as well as most
popular, young men ' who ever mixed a
steam beer for one of the rising genera
tion. A few days ago he lost his position
and at the same time his trouble began.
Friday night he was walking up Market
street with his wife, when he met a cou
ple of friends. He saluted,. as is proper,
but, as soon as he had passed them, his
wife charged him . with being unfaithful
to his marriage vows. He denied the ac
cusation, and thought : no, more of the
matter. â  <â  y
Last night he went home as usual and
was surprised by the report of a pistol as
soon as he entered the room. On making
an examination he found that a small pls
tql had been connected with the door in
such a manner that it would explode as
soon as the door was opened. Fortunately
he escaped the bullet.
An examination showed him that the
room had been completely rifled. All the
valuables as well as the greater portion
of his clothing were gone, and in their
place was a note from his wife, which
read as follows:
"My Dear Husband: I have left you. If
you ever want to see me again call at
Ruby's room to-night or I will be gone
forever."
Mr. Duffey did not call at "Ruby's
room" and says he does not care whether
he ever sees the erring Eva again, but he
ardently hopes that she will never set an
other loaded trap for him. He ls not afraid
to face any man ox loaded gun, but he
does object to a door which is liable to
Inject leaden missiles Into his system as
soon as he opens it.

long blasts of triumph that
awoke the echoes on both

the significant figures 23.76 painted on

Murphy, in his bill of complaint, charges

I have observed for years the great
â¢'number of people who complain of the
-.bad "effect of coffee, and while I can
-'drink coffee or almost anything I want,
./without trouble, it is nevertheless true
that 'we do not use ordinary coffee at
our- house, but for many months have
â been- using Postum Food Coffee. We
find, it in every way preferable to im

afternoon of the Chitose. It was the
last speed trial of the warship, and the
vessel will be formally turned over to

It was a great day for the Union

naturally elated at the wonderful
showing made by the latest product

"She Is the slickest thing I have ever

claimed jubilantly when Interviewed
at his residence last evening. "In a
run of two hours and forty-five min

a quirk or an accident of any descrip

the lowest 22.3. That knocks the

Is a member cannot purchase supplies ,

refuses to Join the association.
He admits having joined the associa
tion so that he might go into business as
a retail butcher. Last November he
moved his shop to another part of the
city, and on November 3, IS9S, was ex
pelled from the association.
This was the beginning of his troubles.
He could no longer buy from members of
the association, and they in turn would
not patronize him, and he complains aa
follows:
"That the association expelled plaintiff
for the alleged reason that he changed
his place of business without giving him
a trial or opportunity to deny charges,
as was his right under the rules of the as
sociation.
"That defendants, in pursuance and
furtherance of their unlawful agreement
and conspiracy to injure this plaintiff,
circulated and caused to be circulated in
the immediate vicinity of his place of
business and among his customers cer
tain circulars defamatory of the meats
and other articles handled and kept for
Bale subsequent to the third day of No
vember, 1898, which circulars were in- ,
tended to and did injure the business of
plaintiff by inducing the public and plain
tiff s customers to believe that the meats
kept for sale by him subsequent to No
vember 3 were inlit for human consump
tion and would inevitably cause sickness
to any person who would eat said meats,
and that defendants, by their said acts,
have driven away a large number of cus
tomers from his shop and have greatly In
jured the business and trade of plaintiff
and destroyed the goood will of plaintiff's
business, to his damage."
He further alleges tnat a blacklist was
distributed among wholesalers and retail
ers of this city and Alameda County, con
taining his name among otners, and that
the defendants have refused to buy from
or sell to him. He then prays for dam
ages in the sum of $100,00. and asks for
other relief. No application is made for a
restraining order. The plaintiff will be
represented in the suit by Morehouse &
Beggs and H. P.- Mathewson.
Mr. Murphy says that he files the suit,
not so much for the purpose of receiving
an award as to put an end forever to the
"tyrannous rule" of the Buttchers' Board
of Trade and open the markets of the city
to competition. It is said to be probable
that Mr. Murphy will be joined in his suit
by other expelled members of the asso
ciation, who are anxious to see its rule
broken.

As the cruiser is not yet Japanese

decorated the ship from stem to stern

of the United States, and the vessel
entered the harbor dressed as for a

NATIONAL GUARD
ORDER WHICH IS
TO BE REVOKED
Effect of the Attorney
General's View.
An Army Officer Inspects the First
California at Manila and How
He Criticized the Regi
ment.
The opinion of Attorney General Fitz
gerald in relation to the standing of the
National Guard of California has brought
j about a state of affairs that was un
locked for a few weeks ago. One of
the results of this opinion is that the
commander in chief will shortly issue an
order revoking the one which some time
since reinstated the Sixth and the Sev
enth regiments of infantry Into the posi
tions which they occupied in the guard
prior to enlistment in the service of the
United States. Under that opinion the
Eighth Regiment of Infantry, but recent
ly mustered out of the volunteer service,
will not be returned to Its former status.
In addition to that, there is the bill
that was introduced in the Senate .by
Senator Dickinson, and which is sure of
passage, having been indorsed by the
military committees. This provides for
the honorable discharge of officers and
members of the regiments and companies
! who were mustered Into the United
i States volunteer service during the year
; 1898. It provides further that the time
j of service for any purpose regarding priv-
I lieges and exemptions provided by law
I for officers and members of the guard, the
i time of those so honorably discharged
shall be computed as continuous service
as if performed in the National Guard,
| and each such officer and man shall have
: an additional period of 100 days imme
j diately following his honorable discharge
I from the volunteer service, or the portion
[ thereof as to his re-enlistment allowed
! him for such purpose, provided he re
; enlists in the guard within that time.
This means that all who volunteered
will be discharged and then there will
have to be a re-formatlon of regiments
and companies and the election of new
field and line officers.
During the past weeks there have been
many talks about the adjutant general
ship. - The latest in that line is that "the
i man who is sure to get it Is a man from
j the south who Is a member of the Grand
; Army of the Republic, for he is a veteran
I of tho Civil War, a member of the Loyal
i Legion, a man of fine appearance, for
| a time connected with the National Guard
! of another State and withal a perfect
; gentleman. Guess who it is?" Those
j who pretend to know will: not reveal his
i name, but they say that it is not one of
i those whose names have already been
; mentioned in connection with the office
For the position of assistant, adjutant
i general it is asserted that the coming
man is Major Newton S. Bangham of the
Seventh Infantry. He Ib also from the
! southern part of the State. Another
I story is that there is every prospect that
the principal appointment will go to Col
onel Stone. Whoever may be the lucky
man it is believed that within two weeks
. he will be named. Â,,..

field, commanding the Second Brigade
has received from one of the officers of
the First California Volunteers at Manila
a report of Captain W. E. Birkhlmer,
ii', . '. A * acting Inspector general, First
Division, Eighth Army Corps, with the in
formation that as he had on a number of
occasions inspected the First in San Fran
cisco, he and the members of the guard
in California would feel an interest in
knowing what a United States army offi
cer thought of the First. The report
shows that the First while in the service
of uncle Sam does not receive the con
sideration which it is expected the army
officers should give the soldiers who are
in active service. The following is the
report:
Military bearing and appearance of troops-
Fine generally; some spitting: in the ranks;
wearing hats awry on the head; standing with
heels widely separated and protruding stomach;
but not very many.
State of disciplineâ Excellent for volunteers.
Condition of arms, accouterments and field
equipmentsâ Arms good; caliber 45; equipments
not perfect, as about 25 men to each company
have leather belts and McKeever cartridge
boxes; the individual mess kits of the men
are not complete.
Troops equipped for field serviceâ Not full,
yet not much short of It; some lack half-shel
ter tents, plates, knives, forks, spoons, web
cartridge belts, Buzzecot ovens, campaign hats,
leggings, etc.
i ".impâ Barracks well located for Manila. To
this is added every care almost that can be
suggested to add to the healthfulness of the
barracks.
In his remarks the captain says that the
First California appeared exceedingly
well, as a whole, at inspection in the new
khaki uniforms. In some respects they
fell below requirements, partly through
unavoidable and partly through avoidable
causes. The pieces in companies A, H.
F and C were in a particularly satisfac
tory' condition, and C is entitled to prece
dence upon the point of relative merit
upon the field. In the matter of keeping
books, records and returns the regiment
he says, stands very high. The laundry
work is carried on in a very satisfactory
manner, due to the enterprise originat
ing within the regiment itself. In conclu
sion he says that the regimen: at the date
of the report, December 14, was prepared
to take the field, although it would be at
a considerable disadvantage on account of
the shortage in full equipment, which the
proper regimental officers were laboring
to remedy. "There is a true military
spirit pervading the regiment through the
commissioned ranks," he adds, "the influ
ence of which is highly salutary. It is a
genuine pleasure to see the effects of it in
the decorous, orderly, efficient and mili
tary manner in which the affairs of the
regiment are conducted."

THE TEACHERS
AT LAST WIN
ONE VICTORY
Miss Georgia Morse
Gains Her Suit.
HER JANUARY SALARY AUDITED
JUDGE SEAWELL CUTS THE GOB
DIAN KNOT.
t.
It Is Believed That the Merchant
Creditors Will No Further Seek
to Block the January
Payments.
The slow-turning mills of the law went
a little faster yesterday afternoon and
the teacher creditors won their January
salariesâ that is, won a decision from
Judge Seawell that if permitted to work
Itself out will bring one month's .money
to the impoverished School Department.
But nobody can anticipate and shut out
the usual injunction.
The decision was from the mandamus
case of Miss Georgia Morse against Au
ditor Wells to compel the issuing of her
salary for last month. The Auditor based
his refusal on the ground that she had
been illegally paid $272 from the funds of
1898-99 for services which she had ren
dered in the fiscal year 1897-98; and also
on the ground that- there were unpaid
claims prior to her ownâ Morse's
school being the Webster Primary, con
sequently her place in the alphabetic line
â Wâ would be low down on the pay list.
The first act of Judge Seawell yesterday
morning was to remodify his modification
of the day before. This last order re
strains Auditor Wells from Issuing the
November-December warrants, but he
may use these demands to offset any
claims which may have been Illegally paid
those teachers. Mr. Wells testified that
his predecessor had paid claims out of
the funds of the following fiscal year
said claims being held back till such
funds were on hand, and from this free
and easy interpretation of the one-twelfth
act a. deficit of $113,000 showed at the be
ginning of the present fiscal year. About
two-thirds of J he teachers had received
ran out ay ( S) salary When the money
t Jill 55*?' dragged along in debates be
tween Attorneys Powers and Olney till
the middle of the afternoon, when Judge
Seawell checked Mr. Powers in a far
reaching, discursive journey into the his
tory of school department financiering by
declaring somewhat briefly that he would
grant the prayer or Miss Morse and or
der the auditing of her January warrant.
In effect he took the short road out of
the labyrinth around him and let her No
vember-December credits offset her debts
to the city, and ordered a stay of Dro
ceedlngs till to-morrow.
There may not be a whole lot of law ln
Judge faeawell's course, but there is a
world of moral right in it. and nobody
knows this better than he. The public
is growing Intensely weary of the every
day shameful spectacle of 1200 defrauded
teachers clamoring for their just dues.
This city owes them probably $260,000, and
the merchants about $88,000, and while
both debts are equally legal and moral
obligations public sentiment is on the side
of the teachers because all of them are
suffering the inconvenience of being un
paid; many of them are destitute, and
some of them are hungry. This harrow
ing picture is not overdrawn.
It is believed and hoped that the mer
chant creditors will not further seek to
tie up the pittance that is to fall to the
employes of the schools of this great,
prosperous city. The latter have sacri
ficed $180,000 and ln all moral reason they
have done enough toward lifting the de
partment out of Its difficulty.
This financial tangle has not- come upon
the school department unawares. In his
annual report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1897, Superintendent Webster
sounded the alarm.
At July 1, 1896, there was "a deficit of
$116,588 caused by unchecked waste and
extravagance." He says in his report
that this excessive expenditure in a will
ful disregard of the provisions of the one
twelfth act was met by "the very clever
scheme of depriving teachers of their sal
aries, so that the law providing that no
debts contracted during a previous year
shall be paid out of the revenues of a
subsequent fiscal year might be evaded
and the deficiency be charged to those
salaries and not to its true cause. This
method has been made to cloak shameful
extravagance."
There is another lapse of law bringing
about a condition up against which the
Board of Education, it is claimed, is
bumping itself. The State constitution
long has said that State school funds
shall.be Used only for the support of
grammar and primary schools, and this
shall be a separate fund for no other pur
pose. This city receives from Sacramento
$650,000 annually, which is lumped in with
money from other sources, and from this
single fund all the school system is main
tained. The five high schools of the city
cost $75 per pupilâ except the Polytech
nic, where the cost is $57 50â while the
grammar and primary schools cost $35.

A number of grammar and primary teach
ers Intend to bring this matter clearly
before the present Board of Education for
the purpose of having the State and the
city apportionment separated. Whatever
the merits or demerits of the complaint,
it might be well, as all hands are quoting
law at the Board of Education, for that
body to conform strictly to rules and
methods laid down in black and white.
Assistant Secretary Thomas Atkinson
of the Board of Education has resigned
his position, the same to take effect on
March 1. His salary is In the same condi
tion as that of the teachers, and an op
portunity presenting Itself to secure a po
sition where the remuneration is more
certain he accepted it. Secretary Simp
son, Assistant Secretary Berliner and the
remainder of the clerical force in the of
fice of the School Board have been work
ing at high pressure since they assumed
the duties of the office in January. The
complications in the department have
more than doubled the work to be done,
and they have been working overtime for
weeks.
Auditor Wells stated last evening that
at last he believes he will be permitted
to sign the teachers' claims, and will set
to work with his office force this morning
preparing the warrants for the treasurer.
Now that he has the mandate of the
court directing him to audit the January
demands he has no fears of making a
possible error.
"Of course, I will consult with my at
torney, General Dickinson," said Mr.
Wells; "but I don't anticipate that he will
advise me against signing the warrants.
Neither do I think that the merchant
creditors will enjoin their payment. I
understand there was a consultation be
tween the attorneys representing the dif
ferent claims and that they came to some
such understanding. But, of course, I
cannot say positively what Monday will
bring forth. I want to see those war
rants paid and those teachers who need
the money relieved. I was glad to see
Judge Seawall decide that way, for the
sake of the teachers. Public opinion, at
least, demands that they be paid."

SUCCESS OF PRELIMINARY WORK FOR
THE GREAT EXPOSITION OF 1901
URGENT NEED
OF SUCH AN
Â'.: ENTERPRISE
One of the Grandest Oppor
: tunities Ever Offered to
California!).,
â ; Situation Ripe for Securing Com
mercial Pre-eminence in the
b Countries of the Orient,
THERE was much gratification ex
pressed yesterday by the friends
and promoters of the Pacific Ocean
and International Exposition over
the success of the committee on leg
islation at Sacramento Friday in
the- first steps taken toward securing State j
aid for the momentous enterprise.
â¢ Only two of the members of the general
committeeâ ]_. Patton and Supervisor
:__aokmann,- accompanied by Secretary R.
P. Doolanâ made the trip to Sacramento,
and the great progress made in the work
assigned to them showed all their energy
â¢ and enthusiasm were fully enlisted in the
task. They made their report yesterday
to the other members of the committee on
.'legislation, who met in the office of C.
1.. Patton. Mr. Patton, who is chair
.. man of- the committee, related how the
' Bart Francisco delegation had unanimous
ly '.indorsed the bills in aid of the fair;
that Senator Wolfe had fathered them in
'â¢â the. Senate and Assemblyman Cobb in the
; Assembly; shat the Governor was favor
. ably inclined toward the project, but
.â -.-wanted more time to investigate the mat
â¢ ter;, and that the measures were to be
; -considered before the Ways and Means
: Committee of the Assembly on Wednes
.,' day. .'-,--. â¢ r .
:' 'After some discussion it was decided
that the: entire committee, consisting of
â  â C, L. Patton, Mayor Phelan, Henry J.
â Cracker; Supervisor Laekmann, George A.
" : Newhail, J. B. Reinstein and J. A.
; Pil-her;. - go to Sacramento and appear be
â¢ ftire.'.the Committee on Ways and Means,
and. that an effort be also made to have
:' the Finance Committee of the Senate con
â¢â¢ vsid^r:'"th'e fair bills about the same time.

â¢â  'support of the State, tnrough the legisla
.ture,.'for. tins great commercial and educa
tional .project.
â¢"-'.lts. gieat importance to the people of
' â .this; Sjtate ana of the entire country is
.â¢"shp'tvn- by .the visit ot Lord Charles Beres
ford, who comes as the representative of
/-.the Associated Chambers of Commerce of
â¢ '-.Great Britain, and his significant utter
; ance, when asked the object of his visit
â ' to . America, "i am most anxious to ob
- ..tain," he said, "an opinion from some of
. the American Chamoers of - Commerce
.with regard to the futre development of
-.- trade and â¢ commerce with the Chinese
.empire." It is argued that if Great Brit
ain 'finds it advisable, far removed as she
â  -h. : from, the field of commercial activity,
â¢â¢to send' out an advance agent of the
standing and' character of Lord Beresford
to look after her interests in China alone,
â¢no- effort on the part of Americans can be
too great or too costly which will tend to
protect and increase her commercial in
: .. tefests throughout the many and popu
lous countries which border on the Pa
*; ci'fic.
â¢These are facts which are realized and
. 'fully appreciated by the men who have
â¢â  lent their names and their efforts to the
proposed exposition of 1901. It is not in
â¢ tended to make it a provincial or lo- j
. cal. affair in any sense. While it is
to- be located in San Francisco and this
city is pledged to contribute the largest
sum toward its creation and maintenance,
there is no section of the State, no section
of th* Pacific Coast and co section of the
United States that will not eventually
feel the benefits of the success of the Pa
cific Ocean and International Exposition.
- The views of C. L. Patton, as expressed
In the course of an interview yesterday,
indicate broadly the proposed scope of
inÂ© iJiir.
"I was very much pleased on arriving at
Sacramento." he said, "to find that there
was. no opposition to these measures
based on the impression that we were try
ii.g.to get. an excessive amount from the
Htatt for the fair. The attitude of many
OT the legislators seemed to be one of

Matrimonial Pail Held.
T. J. Crowley, attorney for Mrs. Grace
Allison and Isaac W. Bain, the convicted
marriage bureau frauds, moved in the
United States District Court yesterday to
have the bail money, amounting to $3000,
exonerated. As the bail was under at
I increase of the home market for domestic
manufactures can only be slow and grad
ual, and there can be no expectation of a
marked increase in the demand unless a
new outlet be found. The consumers of
the manufactured products of the United
States will have to be found in the Ori
ental countries and the countries border
ing on the Pacific Ocean.
"There is a well defined feeling that
California is destined to be one of the
greatest States In the Union. This is
| based on the proposition that California,
j by reason of its situation, - is in a splendid
; position to grasp the opportunities of
trade with the Orient both as a distrib
uting point for the manufactured goods
of the East and as a manufacturing cen
ter itself It is believed to be vastly more
to the interest of California that some -
city on its coast shall become the dis
tributing point of this trade than any
thing else that can be accomplished at
this time. . .:
"The war with Spain has turned the
eyes of all the Oriental countries to the
United States as a first class power. The
annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and
the situation in the Philippines give the
United States commercial opportunities
such as she has never before had and j
such as she may never have again. San
Francisco will have very active competi- |
tors for the advantage and honor of be- I
ing the great entrepot for all this ex
pected new commerce. Among these will
be the large cities of the Sound, such as
Seattle and Tacoma. For this reason
there seems to be an absolute necessity
at this time to draw the eyes of the world
toward San Francisco as the most avail
able port where this trade can be cen
tered. This would.be to the benefit of the
entire State of California, and one of the y
best ways of advertising the State of Cal- I Â«
ifornia would be to hold an exposition at I
the time proposed, active preparations fori f
it to begin at once. , ....
"Properly conducted, such a fair would A
advertise the fact that goods are manu- iT
factured in the United States at lower I â¦
prices and of a better quality than in any A
other country in the world." I

CARRENO'S
CONCERT
Following so soon In the fingerprints of
Rosenthal, as Mme. Teresa Carreno does,
everybody Is prepared to judge her piano
playing by the highest possible standard.
And it will stand for the most rigorous
judgment, and for as many odious com
parisons, as you care to throw. in. She
is a wonderful woman. Her. art is warm,
rich, subtle and mature. Her playing is
authoritative; informed and full of a fine
personal spell that unerringly grips you
where you live and feel. Compare her
to Rosenthal and she is as poetry is to
mathematics; . compare her to Fanny
Bloomfleld Zelsler and the honors are
even in Beethoven and Bach and Car
reno's In Chopin; compare, her to Pade
rewskl and she is still a great artist,; if
â¢indeed as. all others are, something less
than the fabulous Pole. First, she has
the technique, the easy, â¢ effortless tech
nique that makes mechanism forgot; and
then she -has 'the blood and passion and
poetry to make you feel the message of
the music. Her temperament is -un
bounded, and yet it always seems ser
vant to a scrupulous musicianly mind,
and never takes up a fury and runs away
with everything, as I was led to expect
when I saw her heralded by the passion
ate press agent as "the Lioness of the
Pianoforte" or "the Pianka of the Piano
forte," or something equally . fearful.
She tie an exquisitely poised artist who
can lure : poetry from perhaps the most
unpoetic of all instruments.
Carreno commenced with Bach In yes
terday's recitalâ the Fantasie . Chromat
ique and Fugue. The audience, like most
San Francisco audiences, was late In com
ing, 1 and the straggling feet and banging
seats made it almost impossible to hear
just how well the Bach was played. From
what little of it found my ears; I should
say that, the performance was first - rate
scholarly, yet human, and, above all, elu
cidated with happy phrase and articula
tion. Then the crowdâ it wasn't so - much
of a crowd,. either, I mourn to sayâset
tled down, and she played the C sharp
minor sonata by Beethoven," a work of the
utmost simplicity, and melodic beauty, and
one that, is heard. here only, too- seldom.
Carreno played. it with masterly analysis.
The adagio , she gave its full measure :of
grave gray tints; ; the allegretto was a
perfect , bouquet of fragrance and Ingen
uousness; ; and the allegro was taken at
the terrific pace that serves it best and
sounded forth in splendid excitement.
A group of four Chopins followed, in
cluding the G flat etude, in which she
introduced some daring and yet effective
changes in tempi, and the A flat - polo
naise, which she played with superb crash
and without making the * smudge that
most pianists make of < its closely knit
passages. As a Chopin encore she played
the Berceuse so .deliciously and tenderly
that in spite of the ornateness and elab
oration in which the piece abounds you
could almost justify its conventional ac
ceptance as a slumber song. Remarkable
in the second half of the programme were
the Schubert Impromptu, given with de
lightful sympathy and broad singing tone,
and the Paganini-Liszt etude, "La Cam
panula," which sounded Carreno at her
best In bravoura playing.
From every standpoint except the finan
cialâwhich is sure to be better now that
the ice is brokenâ Mme. Carreno was a
success. Everybody who heard her play
yesterday will .want to hear her again.
The few hundreds who were there stood
up and shouted at the close of the con
centâto-day's newspapers will do the rest.
Not since the memorable Paderewski sea
son has there been such an all-round oc
caslon for adulator> ad TJ ectives. EvENs
MACBETH AT -.
H. THE COLUMBIA
The triple star performance of "Mac-
beth" in the Columbia last night dis
closed Mr. Warde In the title part. Miss
Kidder as Lady Macbeth and Mr. James
as Macduff. ; An immense audience was
in attendance and the production was
greeted with considerable favor. " Mr.
Warde's work; was candidly melodra
matic, and Mr. James' was much in the
same vein. A less â¢ ferocious interpreta
tion would have been given had there
been an exchange of parts between the
male stars. Mr. James is a forceful if not
an ideal Macbeth. Mr. Warde brings out
none of the mental, side of the part; his
acting of it is largely a matter of voice
and overwrought stage business. Miss
Kidder, while of course temperamentally
too light for Lady Macbeth, yet managed
to give the lines with understanding and
to build up an Interpretation that was
consistent with her tragic abilities.

ACCUSED OF HUGGING A GIRL.
Joseph Cordes, a Pace Track Man,
Convicted and Held on
Heavy Ponds.
Joseph Cordes, a frequenter of the race
track, was convicted by Judge Mogan
Friday on a charge of battery. Thursday
evening he was on a Sutter street car and
put his arm around a young girl who was
sitting on the dummy close to him. The j
girl complained to the conductor, Thomas :
Harris, who remonstrated with Cordes, i
and Cordes hit him on the face. The
Judge ordered Cordes into custody to ap
pear for sentence yesterday morning with
out bail, but his attorney applied for a
writ of habeas corpus before Judge Cook,
and the Judge released him on $40 cash
bail, but fixed the argument on the writ
for yesterday morning.
Judge Cook yesterday refused to grant
the writ and remanded Cordes into cus
tody. He appeared before Judge Mogan
for sentence, but Attorney Cofrey asked
that sentence be delayed till next Wednes
day,.as he wished to bring forward wit
nesses to testify as to Coraes' good char
acter. 'â â > The Judge remarked that in his
then frame of mind he would give Cordes
the full limit, as he had no sympathy
with "mashers" who Insulted women. The
defendant had appeared in court in an
Intoxicated condition and wanted to run
the court. The Judge. fixed his bonds ln
$1500, but at the request of , Attorney
Kelly, who appeared for the prosecution
he reduced them to $1000.

of 18 to 15.
BERKELEY, Feb. 11.â The baseball
match between the Fireman's Fund team
! and the University. of California this af
ternoon resulted in a score of 18 to 15 in
; favor of the college men. The game was
played on the. Berkeley campus, begin
ning shortly after 3 o'clock. Neither side
showed up in the best form. .-b
The Fireman's Fund made a fairly good
start, and for a while had things their
own way, but for some reason or other
they failed to keep up the pace. Krug's
pitching was somewhat of a disappoint
ment, the home team running up the
score to 17â5. gaining steadily as the
game drew to a close. At the end of the
sixth inning Krug gave way to Moskiman.
The Fireman's Fund thereafter pulled up
slowly. The sides were up as fol

Mechanics' Pavilion resounded last
night with the shouts of a vast assem
blage, drawn to the big amphitheater to
witness the fleetest bicycle riders in the
world make their first appearance on this
side of the continent.
A track eight laps to the mile and so
steeply banked that it seemed Impossi
ble for a human being to ride around it,
was the stage upon which the riders per
formed. Although men on single wheels
and tandems raced at breakneck speed
around it, there â wÂ»as but one fall and that
rider, an Oakland man, only damaged
a picket in the fence bordering the track.
For three hours the sport went on wlth-
out Interruption, ' culminating in a mile
exhibition by "Jimmy" Michael, the mar
velous little Welshman, whose fame has
traveled around the world and penetrated
wherever the utilitarian wheel is known.
Michael is a wee bit '.of. a man, a com
panion picture to "Captain Tod" Sloan.
He reeled off a mile last night in 1:58,
sitting up on his machine as though Out
for a practice spin. He was paced by
Henri Fournier, who was mounted on
his wonderful petroleum â¢ wheel. This
sputters about like a gasoline launch. It
gets on a tremendous headway so soon
as it ls started and then sails over the
surface"of the track like an Ice yacht.
Fournler, who is pronounced the most ac
complished steersman that ever came
over the pond. is a picture. He spreads
himself in a froglike attitude and with
hair standing out straight on his head
and eyes ablaze is a picture of the demon
cycler.
The amateur riders opened proceedings
with a half-mile handicap. One heat was
ridden in one minute flat, while the slow
est was 1:05. The scratch men complained
that the track was bo fast that it favored
the fortunate riders out on the limit
mark, Increasing their speed so noticeably
as to make It next to impossible to over
take them. The Bay City wheelmen
turned out the winner in Walter David
son, who carried the well-known Maltese
cross ,to victory after a close race with
George Tantau of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen. â¢.'..- -- .- - ,
The best race of the night showing the,
highest development of all the qualities
that go 'to. make a great rider was the
third neat of the tandem handicap. This
resolved itself Into a duel between" Mo-
Farland and Stevens, the scratchmen, and
Iver Lawson and Harry Gibson, at 85
yards.. McFarlandand Stevens rode des
perately every Inch of the way and out
down the lead of tneir opponents inch by

tape by hardly, the width of a tire. The
gameness of the riders aroused the sport-

The mile handicap, professional,
brought out the pick of the Eastern and
Coast riders in this class. .In the first
heat were Jay Eaton.. New Jersey on
scratch; Hardy Downing of San Jose. 35
yards; Iver Lawson,, Chicago; 50; Charles
S. Wells, Bay City .Wheelmen, 75, and
Frank Cotter of Tacoma; : 100. . Cotter's,
handicap was so: liberal .that the back
mark men could not catch him,' and he
won easily in . 2:03 2-5. . Eaton, from
scratch, was unable to do anything.- and-
Wells good-naturedly paced the. other two !
for half the race and was beat*, out for his j
pains, Downing taking second and Daw
son third. Â â¢ * ....â¢â¢. .* -..-.:
A batch of â¢ Easterners contested \ the
second heat. They were John i Chapman,
Atlanta, 35 yards; Charles Turville, Phila
delphia. 60; Eddie Leonaxt, Buffalo, 75;
J. W. Nawn, Ireland, 110. Chapman made
a splendid ride: of It, winning in 2:06 2-5;
Leonart. second and Nawn. third. <
In the third were.-. Orlando Stevens of i
lowa on scratch; Teddy Goodman of New
York, 20 yards: . Clem Turville. Philadel
phia, 50; Earl D. Stevens, Buffalo. 75. It
looked like Goodman's race until the last
lap, when Orlando Stevens passed him In
a splendid sprint, winning out by Inches.
The fourth and last heat brought out
Fredericks of Switzerland, 50 yards; Fritz
ON THE SIDE AT THE BICYCLE RACES.
Lacey, Los Angeles, 50; Tom Barnaby,
Boston, 85, and Harry F. Terrill of San
Francisco, 35 yards. Barnaby held his
handicap well, and won with plantv to
spare in 2:07. Terrill had the place well
within his grasp, but Lacey. Jumped him
almost at the tape and won out.
This brought into the final heat Cotter,
Chapman, Barnaby, Stevens and Down
ing. Cotter was In front with Vie longest
handicap, but was soon replaced by Bar
naby. - The other three were bunched
after the second lap, but neither seemed
inclined to set pace, and the result was
Barnaby. and Cotter had the race to
themselves as far as first and second
places were concerned. Barnaby had the
most speed- at- the finish and beat Cotter
out a length. Stevens tried his famous
jump.on the last lap, but Downing held
him Well and captured third place by a
narrow margin. ' The effort in winning the
third heat had "cooked" Stevens and he
was unequal to a bruising race. r ,
The ; half-mile handicap, amateur, was
run in three dashing heats and a final.
The winners of the three heats were Wal
ter J. Davidson, Bay City, 20 yards; R.
Robinson, Road Club. 30, and W. G. Fur
man of Los Angeles, scratch. Furman's
ride from scratch was a beautiful exhi
bition. .George Tantau, Olympic, 40 yards,
and A. Davidson, Bay City, 35, qualified
for the final by riding second in the two
fastest heats. â Â
:. Walter Davidson won the final in clever
style. Fur-man, on scratch, was looked
to by the wise ones, but he could not de
liver the goods' and finished fourth. Tan
tau ran Into second place, and Robinson
â¢took third.
One of the novelties of the evening was a
two-mile exhibition by Henri Founder of
Paris, on his â  motor. . cycle, commonly
termed the "Infernal machine." Fournler
sits y upon his wheel perfectly still, and
without ' moving a muscle rode the first
quarter in 0:31 and the- mile in 2:06, look
ing around and smiling at the audience
as he crossed < the tape. â¢ He finished the
two miles in 4:07, ; the time for the last
mile being 2:01. _â ; y.
f Jimmy Michael, the world's champion
middle-distance rider, commonly called
the "Welsh rarebit," rode a mile exhibi
tion paced by Fournier's motor cycle that
aroused intense enthusiasm, owing to
Michael's marvelous speed and ease of
riding. He covered the quarter ln 0:29 4-5,
the half in 0:59, three-quarters in 1:28 4-5
and the mile In 1:58. Michael could easily
have bettered this time several seconds,
but Fournier made a miscalculation as to
the rate ' of speed on his "Infernal ma
chine." â¢ . .;â¢,....
Eddie C. Bald of Buffalo, the champion
short-distance rider of the world, rode a
half-mile exhibition paced . by Leonhart
I and Harry Terrill, which was speedy
I enough to Indicate that Bald has not been
! neglecting his training, as has been
| stated. He covered the first quarter in
i 0:29 4-5, and the half In 59 seconds flat,
beating out his pacemakers several wheel
lengths at the finish. Bald Is extremely
popular with audiences everywhere, and
his ride was well received.
Harry Gibson of Cincinnati, the holder
j of the five-mile amateur world's cham
; pionship, who has recently turned pro
fessional, rode a mile paced "exhibition in
1:58 2-5. The . Turville brothers of Phila
, delphia paced him the first half and
Chapman and Barnaby of New York made
! a beautiful pick-up, carrying him to tne
i tape. The ride was a very pretty one and
was loudly: applauded. -" Gibson is but 16
years old, and is known as '.'Michael the
Second," owing to his resemblance to the
.Welshman in build and style of riding.
Harry Elkes of Glens Falls, New York,
next came out for a mile paced exhibition.
Elkes is ... the American middle-distance
champion and holds the world's hour re<>
ord of 34 miles 1220 yards. A tandem,
I manned by Harry Terrill and Leonardt,
carried him the first half In 58 4-5 seconds.
Chapman and Barnaby made a pretty
pick-up with their tandem on the second
half mile, and he finished the mile in 1:54,
a world's record for an Indoor, track.
One of the hottest races of the night
was in the third heat of the tandem pro
fessional handicap. The only starters In
the heat were ; McFarland and Stevens,
on scratch, against Harry Gibson and
Lawson, who had eighty-five yards' hand
icap. From the very, start the scratch
team began gaining on their opponents,
slowly but surely, until on the last lap
they lacked but a length of being in the
lead. On the last turn Gibson and Law
i son had the pole,. but "I and Stevie" had
them beaten, and. passing on the outside,
won by a couple of Inches in 1:59 1-5, a
world's tandem record, standing start. ;
â¢ The winners of the other two heats were
Lawson and Julius, who beat the Birdsall-
Thelsen and Turville brothers' teams, and
Downing and Cotter, who defeated Chap
man-Barnaby and Eaton-Goodman. . - .
This brought Into the final McFarland-
Stevens, Downing-Cotter, John- Lawson-
Jullus and Iven Lawson-Gibson. "I and
Stevie"- did- not start, however, as the
latter was too worn out from his efforts
earlier in the evening. : Lawson and Gib
son were also- scratched,; and Chapman
and Barnaby, qualified instead. V
' Downing - and '-. Cotter, with a handicap
of eighty-five yards, were well In the lead
from the start; and were never headed,
,winning s in 1:56 4-5. Lawson-Jullus ' and
Chapman-Barnaby. fought it out lap after
lap on the banks for second position, the
former : team . winning out in the rush for
the tape. yy y - v -'â  *-."'"
The men who are to start In the six-day
race Monday - night -at * 10 o'clock ; were
brought out and Introduced. They are:
Earl , D. " Stevens â¢ of Buffalo, . Oscar - Aron

â¢ NOTES OF THE MEET.
Furman, the Los Angeles crack,
changed his mind about turning profes
sional at the last minute, and will stay In
the amateur class, much to the joy of
the Bay City Club, who will thereby have
a champion ln the club team race next
week. ':V;'\ ... f-yf
H. Austin Goddard, Just In from Aus
tralia, could not stay away from a bi
cycle race, and was greeted by many of
his old-time cycle friends in consequence.
Otto Ziegler Jr. and his bride were pres
ent. Zlegler has been offered a match
with "Baby" Gibson, and may take it on
next week.
A five-mile paced match will be put on
to-night between Teddy Goodman of New-
York and Floyd McFarland of San Jose;
with ten pacemakers each, on tandems,
triplets and multicycles.
The management has decided not to al
low spectators in the center of the track
hereafter, as considerable complaint was
made last night that they interfered with
the view of the people ln the box seats.
The race track was well represented, all
the prominent Jockeys and bookmakers
being present. Many small wagers
changed hands between them, and the
"form" players had all the best of it.
The work of Official Handlcapper Smyth
was highly praised. It was a difficult task
allotlng marks to the Eastern men, some
of whom' had never ridden here before,
and also hard to draw a line on the Call
fornlans, many of whom have not ridden
for several months past.
Much credit was accorded Frank El
well, who designed the track, which has
proved one of the fastest in the world.
To-night's programme j includes, besides
the match between Goodman and McFar
land. a mile handicap, amateur: half-mile
handicap, professional; one-mile tandem
Eursult race, professional: five-mile ex
ibitlon 1 against the .world's record by
Fournier's "infernal machine"; one-mile
exhibition by Jimmy Michael; two-mile
record trial by Harry Elkes; two-mile ex
hibition by Harry Gibson. â¢

A HOME TALK.
Our plan ls 10 sell you a home for the samÂ«
I monthly payments that you are now wasting
Iln rent. Yes, wasting, for you get no re-
! turns. You are continually paying out and
j nothing to show for it. We will give you a
: 4-room and bath cottage for a small payment
down and $20 or $25 per month, which averages
you $5 40 per month Interest or rent. The bal-
-1 ance of $15 every month goes toward the pay-
ment of your home Instead of to the landlord.
, The Heyman Tract is one of the finest resi- ;
dence locations in the city. Castro and 22d sts.,
! close to the tract. Streets graded and sewered.
I Call at office and we will take you out and
I show you the different cottages. .

ESPIONAGE AN
EASY WINNER
OF THE "OAKS"
Maud Ferguson Fin
ished Second.
THE RACE A DISAPPOINTMENT
ADOLPH SPRECKELS TOOK THE
HANDICAP.
Morellito an Awful Surpriseâ
Bartlett Cut a Disgraceful Fig
ure in the Steeplechase.
Four Choices First.
The "California Oaks" of 1899 Is now a
part of turf history. The classic event for
3-year-old fillies was decided before a
large concourse of race goers at Ingle
side track yesterday, and Louis Ezell's
sprightly daughter of Inspector B and
Sun Maid enjoyed a veritable cake-walk.
The field she left behind was a most com
monplace one, none of the young misses
displaying speed or stamina enough to De
classed as anything more than platers of
the selling variety. The time for the mile
and a furlong, 1:57%, is evidence of this
fact. Maud Ferguson, finishing second to
the winner, showed plenty of gameness,
but proved a bitter disappointment.
From a betting standpoint the race was
a rare success. Against the victor as
good as 4 to 1 was at one time obtain
able, and La Penitente, El Estro, Jinks,
Rosebeau and Maud Ferguson had no end
of friends. ' -
At bugle call Espionage ruled an 11 to 5
favorite. The start was a prettty one,
with Maud Ferguson flrst away. Then
for a time El Estro took up the running,
soon giving way, however, to Jinks, the
hopes of Pat Dunne. All this time Hen
nessy had Espionage back ln the bunch,
under double wraps. As the stretch was
reached Jinks was still leading, but her
reign was of short duration. When re
leased from restraint Espionage shot to
the fore and won ln a romp. In a fierce
drive Piggott, by superior riding, ~ot
Maud Ferguson over the line a nose be
fore El Estro, with Devin in the saddle.
It was a charming afternooon for fol
lowers of short priced horses, "that is,
barring one or two slight casualties. |
Morellito, favorite for the handicap, let j
the crowd down with a dull, sickening |
thud, and Colonel Bartlett' s supreme ef- |
fort in the steeplechase cast a gloom over ;
the community. With these two exceptions I
the first choices enjoyed an uninterrupted j
series of successes.
It was perhaps fortunate the handicap
was the last number on the programme. |
Morellito had Spencer and 112 pounds on
his back, and after opening an even money
chance receded to 13 to 10 in the betting. I
Spencer intends returning to New York :
very shortly, and If he is short of funds ;
any number of bettors could be found j
after the race willing and anxious to raise
a fund for him. The slower the pace was
the more tired Spencer became. When i
the race was all over Morellito did not fig
ure among the first three. Adolph
Spreckels, piloted by "Skeets" Martin,
and second choice In the ring, disposed of
Red Glenn like chopping kindling wood. ;
After making a big splash out in front i
Robert Bonner died under a pull.
Doss & Co. started Orion for â c first
time ln the opening six-furlong selling
event, and the brother to Montgomery
closed a 7 to 10 favorite ln the betting.
He soon assumed the front position, and
at the end won very handily from Em.
stem. Bullman landed the 20 to 1 shot
Chappie in the show.
The copper and green of Marcus Daly
was successful in the three-furlong spin
for two year olds. Mortgage, the Mon.
tana-Lottery filly, went to the post a 9
to 10 favorite over her field, and disposed
of the seven babies with apparent ease.
-Bamboulla, a son of Puryear D, took the
place from Belle of Palo Alto with odds
of 50 to 1 about him.
Colonel Bartlett, the gray Jumper from!
the Corrigan potpourri of wonders, was '
a clnchy even money . chance for the â 
steeplechase, and made a disagreeable '
showing. He displayed intermittent
streaks of speed, finally flattening out.
and in disgust Murphy eased him up. > At
the end Lord Chesterfield, with Bob
Cairns up Silverado and Reno fought it
out the first named finally landing a
handy winner from Silverado.
There were only three starters In the
six-furlong run that followed the "Oaks."
Â° Connell, the favorite, seems to have re
gained his old time form, for he led from
s * , -10,I 0 , finlsh . equaling the track record
of 1:13%. Satsuma. got up in time to
down Montgomery a head for the place.
Track Notes.
After reviewing the case of Jockey
Hlggins, suspended for his showing in a
steeplechase some days ago astride the
horse J. O. C, the stewards have .rein
stated the rider. The animal was badly
injured during the race, and an injustice
was done Hlggins In suspending him.
The superb showing made by Colonel
tfartiett in the cross country run was
treated as a huge Joke by the middle
western clique. The California "suck
ers backed the gray horse and should
have known better. The winner evident
ly carried theirs. At a meeting of , the
board of stewards on Friday night Ed
Corrigan stated that he wanted to see
honest sport over the sticks. Then, if
he does, he should begin at home, for
many of his horses run as if trained by
a. Chinese Joss. The Jumping game at
Ingleside is run to suit Blakely & Co.,
and the proofs of this assertion are not
lacking. The fingers of the clique were
toasted when St. Jacob beat Monlta one
day last week, and it is dollars to a little
red apple Daly, the rider of St. Jacob, i
will shortly be suspended. That Is, un- l
less he enters the fold. There will short
ly be some Interesting developments in
the jumping horse line.
A. B. Spreckels was a visitor at the
track yesterday. Bamboulla, which ran
second ln the two year old scramble, was
bred at the Napa Stock Farm, owned by
Mr. Spreckels.
FOB THE CHINESE HOSPITAL.
An Entertainment, Successful in Ev
ery Bespect, Given Last
Night.
Pleasant and unique was the entertain
ment given at the Chinese Presbyterian
Mission on Stockton street last night for
the benefit of the Chinese Hospital about
to be established at 920 Washington street.
Rev. Dr. Masters was master of cere
monies. He opened the entertainment
with an address in Chinese, during the
course of which he said many things
which pleased the Chinese part of the au
dience and mystified the other half. At
the conclusion of his speech Dr. Smith
rendered a tenor solo, and Miss Pearl No
ble, accompanied by her sister Maude on
the piano, delighted the audience with a
cornet solo. Then came the event of the
evening. It was the singing of "Just Be
fore the Battle, Mother," by Henry, a
5-year-old Chinese boy, accompanied on
the piano by his sister Margaret, who has
stood the storms and sunshine of seven
California summers and winters. Henry

Victor Costello, Alias "Kid Tierney,"
Booked, and Mrs. .Tierney and
Her Daughter Held.
The burglary at the residence of Mrs.
Jessie McLeod, 1414 Kearny street, Janu
ary 30, has been definitely traced to An
drew Costello, alias "Kid Tierney"; Mrs.
Margaret Tierney and her daughter, Ame
lia, a girl 14 years of age. Yesterday Cos
tello, who is an ex-convict, was booked at
the City Prison on the charge of burglary,
but no charge has yet been made against
Mrs. Tierney and her daughter. The de
tectives found some of the stolen proper
ty yesterday in the house on Green street
where Mrs. Tierney lived, which strength
ens the case against her.
An error was made in stating that Mrs.
Thompson, one of Mrs. Tierney's married
daughters who lives in the. house adjoin
ing Mrs. McLeod's, had also been arrest
ed. The young girl Amelia had been liv
ing with her for about two weeks, and
she had been doing everything in her
power to break the girl away from her
evil associations. Mrs. Thompson knew
absolutely nothing about the crime. She
denies that "Kid Tierney" is her brother
or that he has any right to the family
name. "'
Fall of the "Boy Plunger."
Edward Lydon, the "boy plunger," is
tinder arrest in the city prison on a charge
of vagrancy. He was taken in Thursday
night on Berry street by Policeman Kinch,
who says that he has been hanging
around that neighborhood at all hours of
the day and night. He was taken before
-Acting Police Judge Barry yesterday
morning and, at his request, the case was
continued till to-morrow, and meantime
his mother will be notified.
Lydon created quite a sensation about
fourteen months ago. He was then con
fidential clerk in the office of N. K. Mas
ten, financial agent of the Southern Pa
cific, and used his employer's money to
"plunge" on the races and in the wheat
pits He lost about $3000; and when ar
rested at the Ingleside rack track De
cember 8, 1897, by Detectives Gibson and
Wren he had $180 in his pockets and about
$900 worth of pool tickets. He was
charged with felony embezzlement and the
case was assigned to the late Judge
Campbell's court. About two weeks later
the cases were dismissed, as his mother,
a widow living on Polk street, mortgaged
her property to pay off the money he had
stolen from his employer.
Lydon is now only 24 years of age, and
since his discharge from prison he has
been a railroad tout and hanger-on at
places where disreputable women live.

Relatives Claim That Dr. ; Alfred

Failing 'Seekrb to Prevent
Her Wedding.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
_ yyy-. 1428 Park street, Feb. 11.
Hidden behind the announcement. of the
engagement of Miss Amanda Roebke of
College avenue and Dr. J. S. Green, which
declaration was flatly denied by the
young man's mother, Mrs. S. S. Green of
623 Santa Clara avenue, is a story with
which the name of another dashing doc
tor of this city is connected. Like all love
; affairs, Miss Roebke's seems to have its
romantic side. The young lady's sister is
responsible for the statement that Dr. Al
fred Sander^once had a warm place in his
â  heart for Miss Amanda, and that because
â  she transferred her affections from him to
j Dr. Green he used his influence with the
young medico's mother to prejudice her
1 against the girl and persuade her to step
in and break up the match. This story,
coming on the eve of Dr. Sander's wed
j ding to Miss Ruth. Gruenberg, has given
I the gossips one of the most delectable
\ morsels they have had to roll on their
' tongues for many a day.
Miss Roebke was formerly maid ln Dr.
'. Sander's establishment. She looked after
i the comfort of his lady patients.
It was while occupying this position
I that the doctor is said to have discovered i
I a warm spot in his heart for the beautiful j
j brunette. It became public property that j
i she reciprocated his affections, and all !
j was "as merry as a marriage bell" until j
I young Jacob S. Green appeared on the '
i scene. He had just- become possessed, of
the idea that he wanted to study medicine i
and Dr. Sander undertook to help him .
I along in his chosen profession by employ- |
: ing him in his laboratory.
That was the mistake of the doctor's i
life, if he was really serious In his atten- I
tions to i Miss Roebke. It was the begin- !
! ning of the end of whatever bond of af- j
fection that might have existed between ;
them. Green laid siege to the heart of the j
maid and the conquest was as easy as ;
Dewey's victory at Manila. Shortly after,
without any ceremony. Dr. Sander dis- I
charged both of his employes and his !
friends noticed that his subsequent ac- |
tions resembled those of a man who had j
been crossed in love.
Miss Elsie Roebke says the doctor has
I played the dog in the manger part in the
little romance, and that when he failed to
I win the love of her sister he vowed she j
j would never marry the doctor of her i
I choice. She blames Dr. Sander for Mrs.
I Green's opposition to the match, and de
i clares he is "Just too mean for anything" ,
I to interfere.
When seen to-day Dr. Sander readily ad- I
i mitted that both Miss Amanda Roebke I
and Dr. Green had been in his employ,
but quite natural with a gentleman on the
1 eve of his wedding to another lady he was |
; loth to admit that his feeling for Miss
I Roebke had been other than one of friend
i ship. x
"When she was flrst engaged in my of
fice," said Dr. Sander, "she put In most
j of her time receiving her young gentle
men friends. She had so many callers
that I was forced to tell her that she
i would have to entertain ' her acquaint
! ances some other place and after office
hours. Young Green was among her vis
j itors. I took a fancy to him and gave
I him permission to call whenever he felt
,' so disposed. Later I gave him a position i
!in my laboratory. In a few days I. dis- I
j covered that he and Miss Roebke were j
I so obstreperous in their affections that
; they were neglecting their work, and I
advised them that if they wished to re
main in mv employ they would have to
do their billing and cooing after office
hours. I can't say that I was ever in love
with the girl or that I felt like commit
ting suicide when young Green won her."
Dr. J. -8. Green recently graduated from*
'the Cooper Medical. College and bas re
ceived the appointment of surgeon of the
steamer City of Panama. He la now on
his way to Acapulco to enter upon the
duties of his new position. At his request
Miss Roebke did not announce their en
gagement until after he had passed be
yond the Golden Gate on his way south.
The reason given was that the young
medico was afraid of the wrath of his
mother, and wanted to be beyond the
reach of a scolding. Mrs. 1 Green denied
that her son was engaged and stated that
the difference in religion was an impene
trable barrier between the young people.,
-Miss Roebke has sought to settle the
question "by writing to her lover at Aca
pulco, requesting him to telegraph at once
confirming the truth of their betrothal.
The young lady has been prostrated with
grief over the unpleasant notoriety she
has received. - ,

An Incident in Episcopalian Circles
That May Figure During

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, '
908 Broadway, Feb. 11.
The rector of the Church of the Advent,
Rev. V. Marshall Law, has gone into
politics, and has brought down upon him
self much severe criticism. This is the
church of which John J. Valentine is
senior warden, and there is some curios
ity being expressed as to whether the rec
tor's -utterance in the church magazine
has anything to do with the president of
the great express corporation.
In the Choir and Nave, to be issued to
the parishioners to-morrow, appears the
following:
â  Don't fall to be ln church next Sunday
morning, the 12th Inst., to hear John J.
Valentine, the . senior warden, on "â lm-
perlal Democracy," in place of the regular
sermon. It ls not often that we have- an
opportunity to hear the senior warden, so
be there at 11 o'clock.
The. Church of the Advent has an op
portunity to have" a Councilman. J. Wal
ter Scott is a candidate on the Independent .
Republican ticket. Indorsed by the -Demo- '.
cratic convention. His opponent is Mr.
' Rowe. Mr. Scott Is the fourth on our list
of systematic offerings, and has also a' pew
In the church. Every member of his family
ls also on the list of systematic offerings,
his little daughter being first. If you take
any interest ln Councilmen remember to
vote for Mr. Scott. He has not asked us to
mention him, knowing that this little paper
does not deal in politics. But for once we
break over that rule. Mr. Scott stands for
the Seventh Ward.
Mr. Scott's opponent is Mr. H. D. Rowe,
who at present represents the Seventh
Ward in the City Council-. Mr. Rowe has
made a splendid record, and has Just been
nominated. by the Republicans and Mu
nicipal League to succeed himself. He
declines to enter into any controversy
with Rector Law, but his friends, not be
ing in politics, are not so reticent. They
Bay that not long ago Mr. Rowe and his
family were members .of Rev. Law**
church. They quit for good and sufficient
reasons. Mr. Law is a very radical
preacher, and some of his doings have
been spoken of as being "mountebanklsh"
for a pulpiteer. Mr. Rowe did not appre
ciate such doings in an Episcopalian
church and withdrew. This is said to *.c
the reason why the rector has used the
church organ to help defeat one of the
candidates on the regular Republican
ticket. It Is believed that the church
board should discountenance the action of
its pastor.

bb; y . peal to Supreme Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
, .908 Broadway, Feb. 11.
After deliberating over four hours the
Jury in the sensational suit of George H.
Francoeur against Mrs. Gertrude K.
Jones and her divorced husband, E. Nor
wood Jones, brought in a verdict this aft
ernoon In favor of defendants. The trial
occupied eleven days. yvy'fff.
The -suit, brought for the recovery of
$500 claimed on a promissory, note, was
commenced last May. Since that time
the case has been attended with many
sensational features. Joseph Hutchinson,
brother of Mrs.', Jones, acting as her at
torney, had filed an answer in the note
suit containing allegations on which
Francoeur and H. M. Beatty based pro
ceedings for his disbarment. After, a
hearing teeming with bitter invectives
Hutchinson won out before Judge Hall.
Since the beginning of the suit, too, E.
Norwood Jones has been arrested for for
gery In the East and ls now serving time
in a Tennessee penitentiary...
The present suit has been fought bitter
ly. Plaintiff was represented by Attor
ney Beatty and A. L. Frick, while Mrs.
Jones' interests were looked after by
George de Golia, J. Hutchinson and Frank
Oils. The defense set; up fraud and-con
spiracy by Beatty, Francoeur and Jones
to secure money from Mrs. Jones, to be
used In supporting . evidence at the trial
of Jack Howard for the murder of Annie
Johnson, it being intimated that Jones
was,, implicated.
In a cross-complaint Mrs. Jones claimed
$5000 damages from Francoeur.", The ver
dict rendered to-day also covers this
phase of the litigation, and Mrs. Jones re
covers nothing. The jury was polled and
it was found the verdict had been unani
mous.
Judge Ellsworth, before whom the case
was tried, decreed that the cost of jury,
court reporter and mileage be paid out of
the money deposited by defendants, "it
being the rule for the prevailing party
to pay this. These costs amount to $425.
. A stay of execution for thirty days has
been granted and the case will , be ap
pealed to .the Supreme Court. '.;â

OAKLAND, Feb. 11.â It is ; given out
that it is the intention of the defense in
the Brandes . murder â¢ trial to .place the
accused man on y the ' witness " stand
In his own defense. This will be done
to give Brandes an opportunity of giving
his version of the beating described by
Mrs. M. Godfrey yesterday, 'and to which
numerous others will testify. It will be
remembered, perhaps, that immediately
after his arrest^ Brandes :â  stated that his
wife had beaten Lillian with a ! stick. >, In

ever handled the girl roughly. ......
MURDERER LOCATED
AFTER MANY YEARS
Slayer of Sheriff Pomber of
Monterey County Will Soon
Be Captured.
SALINAS, Feb. After thirteen
years ;of persistent searching, ( the
whereabouts of the murderer of Sheriff
J. N. Pomber has been discovered, and
his apprehension seems certain. Con
stable. Joseph Dosh of San Lucas came
to this city last week from the south
and asked the Supervisors for sixty
days' leave of absence. When this was
granted the fact leaked out that he was
expecting to leave for a place kept se
cret to arrest the murderer. ,
On the 19th of May, 1886, the officers
here were notified that. three English
men â brothers, - named John, Arthur
and Walter Draper â while touring Cali
fornia by team arid camped near Sole
dad, south of this city, were attacked
by unknown persons and two of the
brothers wounded. From the story of
the Englishmen it seems that late at
night they were aroused from sleep by
pistol shots fired by the murderous
ruffians, who stood in the door of the
| tent. Two of the campers were wound
ed by the volley. One of the Draper
! brothers grappled with one of the in
truders, and in addition, to the wounds
j he had already received he was struck
: on the head with a club or pistol and
felled to ' the ground. The J assailants,
two In number, then made' their es
cape. b , "V
Arthur and Walter Draper, who were
wounded, were brought to Soledad. in
a wagon, accompanied by John Draper,
who was uninjured. Upon examination
Walter was found to have been shot in
the heel, thigh and abdomen, and
Arthur in the back of the neck, leg and
arm. A full description of the ruffians
was published at the time, in which one
of them was described as of light com
plexion and the other dark. Excitement
ran high, and posses were organized to
search for the assassins.
Nothing was heard of the culprits
until May 24, when word was brought
to Castroville that they had been seen
three or four miles out in the hills
toward Watsonvllle that afternoon.

The committee unanimously Indorsed ex-
Sheriff E. -W. , Jones for the position.
Deputy Sheriff Manuel Pomber of Cas
troville, Constable Metz and others
started in pursuit, going in different
directions across the country. Pomber
met ConÃtable Dunlap of Watsonvllle
and they concluded to watch the wagon
road and the railroad track where they
emerged from the hills into Pajaro- Val
ley. Pomber had a double-barreled
shotgun and Dunlap a pistol.
At 8:30 o'clock that night two men
approached from down the track. When
they drew near Pomber leveled his gun
and ordered them to throw up their
hands., The two opened fire on the of
ficers. One shot struck Pomber on the
right side of the neck; in front, felling
him to the ground. Dunlap returned
the fire, but without effect, as the two
desperadoes scrambled over the fence
and were lost to sight in the darkness.
The two men were heard of frequent
ly, but could not be apprehended. Two
officers of San Juan, however, captured
a man answering the description of one
of the pair. He was brought to Salinas
and lodged in the County Jail. On pre
liminary examination he gave his name
as Lewis ', Clark.
He was held to answer for robbery
and for attempt to murder.' He pleaded
guilty, but before being sentenced said
his name was not Clark. He told of his
meeting with his "dark" companion,
who was known to him as John, and
of the plot to rob and kill the Drapers.
He said. John had shot Pomber and then
disappeared. Judge Alexander sen
tenced Clark to twenty-one years in
the State prison. -.
In his statement ' before the court
Clark satd his companion was a no
torious Eastern desperado and an .ex
pert pistol shot, and at that time (1886)
was wanted in nine different States for
crimes of murder and robbery.
Time went on and the case had been
forgotten by many, but Constable
Dosh, a fearless officer, once a deputy
Sheriff, in Colorado and afterward peace
officer in lowa, worked on the slender
clew until now he believes he has land
ed his man.
Clark's time will expire in 1900, and he
will be an important witness in the
case.-- â -.
DR. JEWELL
PASSES AWAY
PACIFIC GROVE, Feb. 11.â Rev. Dr. ,
F. F. Jewell, one of the founders of Pa
cific â¢ Grove, and always a prominent
figure in the town's history, a leading
light of Methodism on the Pacific Coast,
educationally as well as from the pul
pit standpoint, died at his home in this
city at midnight last night, after an ill
ness of - two weeks. The immediate
cause of death was gastritis, aggra
vated by other complications, chief
among . which was a kidney trou
ble from which he had suffered for sev
eral years.. Having passed a life of un
ceasing work, his pride being in the
fact that he had never allowed himself
a day's vacation, his whole system was
undergoing a gradual breakdown that
only needed his present illness to pro
duce collapse. True to his life plan, he
did not cease work even upon his sick
bed, but between moments of suffering
would dictate to his secretary notes to
be used ;in formulating the coming
summer's programme of events.
Dr. Jewell was born at Floyd, 1 Onei
da County, New York, November 9,
1830. He received his education in the
public schools and select academies of
his native county until his eighteenth
year, when he began teaching. After
becoming of age he held several minor
township offices, during which time he
studied law, but never completed his
law course, abandoning it after his con
version to Methodism for, the study of
theology. In 1859 he took charge of his
first pastorate at Heuvelton, St. Daw
rence County,' N. Y. In 1872 .he was
transferred to the California confer
ence, being appointed to the pastorate
of the Howard Street Methodist Epis
copal Church, San Francisco. Since
then he has filled the pastorate of the
Central Methodist Episcopal Church,
San Francisco; First Church, San Jose,
twice; Howard Street, San Francisco,
twice,' and Simpson Memorial, San
Francisco (the latter church he found
ed), remaining at each place to the lim
it of the time allowed by the law of his
church.
At the time of his death. Dr. Jewell
held the pastorate of the Pacific Grove

rectors : say, it will be decided whether
the bank is to go out of business, or, : by.
calling in more capital, continue in ex- j
istence.. Some of - the ;. officials think it
might be possible to continue business
if the stockholders gave their combined
support to the movement. -/.,-*

Unusual interest ls being manifested by
â¢ residents of Gilroy and vicinity ln the
'.divorce. proceedings instituted by the Rev.
; '.W, 'â ',', YD.-: Crabb, a Methodist minister,
. against his .wife, Hattie A. Crabb, which
â  : - Is scheduled .for trial before Judge A. S.
Kit pre at San. Jose on Tuesday next.
; The', prominence of the plaintiff, his call
. Ing and the sensational charges made by
.the wife in her answer are reasons for
â¢ the undue interest.
'bDf. Crabb charges his wife with ex
treme, cruelty and sets forth ln his com
.': plaint the contents of several letters from
her, In which she. accuses him of having
:'â  '.broken.; his .marriage vow, all of which,
according to the minister's plaint, has
.' caused him ' great mental anguish and
â¢â¢ suffering;-
-.. Th e.wife in her answer accuses the
â¢ husband of having entertained an unholy
: passion ' for a beautiful young lady who
.', sang .In his church choir at Gilroy, and
â¢'further states that when she remonstrat
b ed with him ah account of his attentions
to the fair singer he replied that "lt was
I an act of special divine providence that
: had brought them together and that God
. . had given' him something to love."
â¢' .'. it seems the doctor was of a literary
â¢â¢â¢â¢â  turn of mind, and in his devotion to the
lady dedicated two poems to her, under
they titles; "Esther, the Ideal," and "To
Esther." lh his effusion to the Ideal
..'Esther .he muses: "She has a voice
. sweeter than a mellow lute â¢ â¢ â¢ with
-.- 'par'melian' lips' â¢ * * a kiss pure as

In his second poem, "To Esther," writ
â  ten -from- the City of Angels, he pours
.'.'.out- his soul in the following burning
â¢-lines: " .

.. Unsatisfied with the above passionate
outburst; he informed Mrs. Crabb he
â¢ .Would' make this young lady shine like
a "star" and that Gilroy would be proud
â¢ of having given her birth, as Anathoth
' was proud that it was the birthplace of i

â ' -the minister so wrought upon the nervous
py'st'em of Mrs. Crabb that she became
"". '"broken' down ih health, and was obliged
'" to leave Gilroy and go to Southern Cali
fornia in search of health and change of
scene, "the .doctor accompanied her and
.it was understood' by both that they
would -.sojourn in : that vicinity for a
month. But the spell that bound him to
the new Esther was too strong, as he re
mained in Los Angeles but two days and
returned to Gilroy alone.
On his arrival he wrote to his wife, say
ing she must remain in the south for an
Indefinite -period, as it would be for the
best .interests of all parties that she do
so. Later he. forbade ncr to return to Gil
roy and slated 'that he would never live

ties. The doctor, however, was fixed in
his determination not to live with her any
more and turned her out and compelled
her to go back to San Francisco.
During the month of January, 1898, Dr.
Crabb advised his wife to go over to Dr.
Robertson's Sanitarium, as he was a spe
cialist in nervous diseases. In obedience
to his suggestion she went to Livermore,
and on her arrival was assigned to one of
the wards for the insane. This so Infu
riated. Mrs. Crabb that she wrote scorch
ing letters to her husband, charging him
with nearly every crime In the calendar
of sin. She remained ln the sanitarium,
but in a different ward, until the sth of
April, when she returned to this .city.
The doctor seemed determined that she
should not be at liberty very long, and on
the 27th of April he came to San Francisco
with Deputy Sheriff Charles Gardener of
San Jose and the latter after telling Mrs.
Crabb a smooth story that she was
needed as a witness in San Jose induced
her to take a trip there.
On arriving in the Garden City she was
taken before the Commissioners of Lu
nacy and the letters she had written from
Livermore were produced against her by
her husband, as Insane acts upon her
part, and upon them and together with
statements made by the minister she was
committed to the Insane Asylum at Ag
new, where she remained until the 17th
day of August, when she was released on
probation at the earnest solicitation of
Mrs. H. A. McCormack, a leading mem
ber of the Methodist church, and was
finally discharged within a month, only
to be met by her husband's suit for sep
aration.
Mrs. Crabb is determined that the doc
tor shall not receive a decree and through
her attorneys has filed an answer In
which the above facts are set forth. Her
counsel Intend to prove by witnesses that
Mrs. Crabb was never Insane, but was
simply railroaded to the asylum.
The church-going people of Gilroy,
where the doctor preached, have taken
sides in the Interesting controversy and
are considerably wrought up over the af
fair. It is expected that when the trial
is inaugurated on Tuesday many of his
old flock will attend, as the trial will de
velop many sensations.
Rev. Dr. Crabb, besides being the au
thor of "Lyrics of the Golden West." is a
preacher in high standing in the Metho
dist church. He is at present minister
ing to his flock in South San Francisco.
In the trial the minister will be Repre
sented by D. "W. Burchard of San Jose,
and Mrs. Crabb by M. C. Hassett and
Walter J. Thompson of San Francisco
and Frank J. Hambly of the firm of
Morehouse & Hambly of San Jose.
NATIVE DAUGHTERS
AND THEIR HOME
ITS OBJECT BEING EXPLAINED
TO ALL PARLORS.
The Donations That Have Been Made
During the Past Pew Weeks
to Help The Cause.
Since the dedication of the -Native
Daughters' Home, on O'Farrell street, be
tween Polk street and Van Ness avenue,
on the 2d of last January, considerable
Interest ln ; that worthy Institution has
been aroused in the order of Native
Daughters of the Golden West all over
the State. Mrs. Lena H. Mills of Joaquin
Parlor, of Stockton, who ls the grand
president of the order, was in the city
some time ago, and by invitation was
present at a meeting of the trustees of the
home. She took a deep interest in the
undertaking and obtained all information
possible as to Its history and line of work,
for the purpose of disseminating that in
formation to all parlors on her official
visits. This she has done in the past few
weeks, telling, wherever she went, about
the advantages that the home offers to all
native daughters who may come to San
Francisco â  unattended. In this she is do
ing excellent missionary work, and the in
formattion she is giving in various parts
of the State will do much to make the ob
jects of the home as an abiding place
and a place for the care of the sick of
the order, known and appreciated. .
. In the meantime the energetic board
of directors is doing all that can be done
to Impart information about the institu
tion by explanation during personal' vis
its to parlors and by; sending out descrip
tive and Instructive circulars.
The members of Da Estrella Tarlor of
this city will give. a grand literary treat
in Native Sons'. Hall on the night of tne
2oth Inst., when a small admission fee
will be charged and the proceeds will be
given to the fund for the maintenance of
the home. It is stated that. "Evangeline"
will be presented and there will, in addi
tion, be a choice programme of numbers
and possibly other attractions. The ob
ject is a* good one and deserves" the sup
port of every native son, as well as daugh
ter, in the city.
Callfla Parlor No. 22 of Sacramento, of
which Mrs. W. S. Leake, chairlady of the
board of trustees, is a member, held a
meeting a few evenings since, at which
there were present not less than sixty
members. At that meeting the objects of
the home were fully discussed and ex
plained, and before the close of the meet
ing It was decided that the parlor would
render financial aid toward the main
tenance of the home, and that at no dis
tant day it would get up an entertain
ment in aid of. the Institution.
During the past three weeks the fol
lowing donations have be,en made to the
home by members of the order: From
Veritas Parlor of Merced, Oneonta Par
lor of Ferndale and Orlnda Parlor of San
Francisco, $20 each; ' Ramona Parlor of
Martinez, $10; San Jose Parlor, $5; Golden
Bar Parlor of Sierra City, $3, and Juanita
Parlor of Amador, $2. Miss Eliza D
Keith of Alta. Parlor has made the first
donation to the library in the shape of a
contribution of. books, and it is probable
that others who have good literature will
add to the number already given, and that
in a short time there will be a choice col
lection of books on the shelves. Mrs. J J
Spieker of Buena Vista Parlor has do
nated a liberal supply of envelopes and
letter heads; Piedmont Parlor of. Oak
land has sent a rocking chair; Mrs. Metz
ier, a member of one of the local parlors
has offered the funeral expenses in case
of a death ln the home, and Mrs. H. M.
Greene of the trustees has donated a Bet
of fire Irons.

Ex-Champion.
EXPECTS FAVORABLE REPLY
THE FIGHT WILL TAKE PLACE
ON MAY 26.
Fistic Impresario Says His Man
Will Surely Whip- Fitzsimmons
if the Contest Lasts Over
Three Bounds.
Manager "William Brady said yesterday
afternoon that he expects to have James
J. Corbett as a sparring partner for Jef
fries during his training for the big mill
with Fitzsimmons, and in that event the
ex-champion will be seen in the boiler
maker's corner on the night of the con
test. When it was suggested to Brady
that it would be a rather expensive prop
osition to engage Corbett in that capacity
he replied , that he did not think so, as
"Jim" was very friendly to him, and he
was certain that he would not refuse such
a request.
There is.no gainsaying the fact that
Corbett would be a valuable man to Jef
fries ln his coming encounter. In the
flrst place, Corbett is probably the best
teacher of fisticuffs in the world to-day.
In fact he was a tutor long before he
had any aspirations ln the professional
line. Secondly, he is In a position to give
Jeffries many pointers as to Fitzsimmons'
tactics, and also his weak points, which he
had every opportunity of learning, much
to his sorrow, during his unfortunate
meeting with the blacksmith at Carson-
Added to this, the moral effect of Cor
bett's presence in the ring as Jeffries'
second on the eventful night is bound to
be dispiriting to Fitzsimmons, and the
value of such an influence can not be
overestimated. If nothing else will be ac
complished by his presence than to worry

Miss Taylor, won the Winslow medal
for February, with a net score of 155.
Over at Oakland the links were bright
with ladies in scarlet jackets, and golf
went on merrily from early in the after
noon till dark. The tournament for the
Tibbetts cup, which was begun on Sat
urday, February 4, has gone on, and has
now reached the semi-final round. The
tournament , has been conducted on the
following principle: Twenty -one com-,
petitors originally entered. Subtracting
twenty-one from thirty-two (the nearest
power of two) we get eleven. Accordingly
in the preliminary round eleven players
drew byes, and the remaining ten were
matched against each other in five
couples. The five winners, with the eleven
byes, make sixteen players, or eight
couples. The . eight winners make four
couples. The four winners make two
couples, and the two winners are in the

OPPOSE TRADE STAMPS.
A Test Case to Be Made of the New
Fresno Ordinance.
A matter of law which will be of no
small interest to municipalities is to be
passed upon in the Supreme Court in the
near future. In the latter part of last
year the city trustees of Fresno came to
the conclusion that the trade stamp of
commerce is not such a good thing as is
claimed for it and should be discouraged.
To this end an ordinance was passed in
September setting forth that every per
son, firm or corporation carrying on or
conducting the business of selling trade
stamps or tickets of any kind, redeem
able in money, merchandise or any other
thing, and so redeeming the same, should
Say a license of $200 per quarter. H. R.
IcKenney came within the prescribed
class, and on the 4th inst. he was arrest
ed by the City Marshal, M. L. Woy, for
violating the ordinance.
Upon trial he was convicted and now he
has applied to the Supreme Court for a
writ of habeas corpus, stating that he is
illegally restrained of his liberty. Ho sets
up that the license is disproportionate to
the licenses of other lines of business, be
ing nearly forty times as great. McKen
ney states that the amount of the license
is prohibitive and beyond the jurisdiction â 
of the Board of Trustees to impose, '_.*Â©
petition was granted by the court and '
will be heard at an early dale. The Inter
est in the coming decision lies in the fact
that similar ordinances have been passed
or are being contemplated in other cities
of the State where the trade stamp haa
obtained a foothold.
He Will Try It Again.
Charles W. Vosmer, the daring aero
naut, who was so badly injured by fall
ing from his ballbon last October, has en
tirely recovered and will make an ascen
sion and parachute drop at ! the Chutes
this afternoon. The occasion will be a
benefit for him, and as the winds are very
favorable at this time of the year he ex
pects to almost go out of sight.

yy "KONG HE FA CHOY!" That was the salutation with which
; each man. greeted his neighbor. Now every well-posted San Fran

Accompanied by L*. Maynard Dixon, the artist, I started to make

:.â¢ The- 'same old scenes, and more particularly the same old odors which
â one- realizes throughout the Orient from the Suez to Yokohama, meet
.' the eye and offend the nostrils at every turn.
The streets are - animated by a perfect congestion of Mongolian
humanity; strange sounds greet the ear; every color of the rainbow
'. is reproduced in the gaudy dress of the New Years callers. We
stopped at the corner of the first narrow street and observed a bit
of touching devotion to the artistic, for which all Orientals are notedâ
a flower stand. The extent of the stock in trade was the Suey Sin Fah
âthe water spirit lily; a lovely member of the narcissus family, which
was being greedily purchased by rich and poor alike. ...
None of the haggling over price so common with the Orientalâ
for it is considered a breach of good manners to mention money on
New Year's day. All were jollyâ air seemed happy. The faith of the
fatalist was predominant. Every man, . woman and child was con
fident that the dawn of another year meant health, wealth and pros
perity. On every threshold and on every window sill was the bloom
ing water lily, the sign of good fortune.
What a pretty little fiction is the story of the water spirit Illy!
According to an ancient legend of the people, centuries ago there
lived in what might he called Central China a good and wise old
man who had devoted his life to study. He was a scholar of great
fame throughout the empire. His commercial Instincts were few and
. as he grew aged and decrepit he found that his small store of worldly
goods had vanished in the purchase of books, and he was destitute.
. When the last cash was spent he fell on his knees and kow-towed to
" the Deity above and asked for help to sustain his failing body until
the end. -should come* â 
â¢ .According to this legend his prayer was heard in high heaven
.and that very night he was visited by a spirit who asked: "What
â  Wduldst.thou ?" â¢ The old man answered: "Only the wherewithal that
:. ;.I : may : liv.e out my allotted days on earth." The spirit handed the old
:; /.scholar a small package wrapped in silk and said: "The contents
'.. this package will bring thee fame and prosperity. Guard it well."

From the temple to the house of the opulent merchant is but a
step from the- religious to the commercial* side of our diminutive
Orient. The merchant had returned to his place of business and each
member of his household was prostrate before the family shrine, with
out which no Chinese residence is complete. Over the little altar, rep
resenting the ancestors of this particular house, was a picture of a
peculiar trinity which is noticeable in every Chinese house during
the New Year's festivities. It represents a man with flowing mus
tache and hair dressed in a most peculiar manner. He is accom
panied by two attendants, which one might mistake for women, but
in reality they are boys. This is Quong Kung â the god of war, who
centuries ago was. known as the most honest man in all China. He
was presumed to have descended from heaven and fought the battles
of the empire until no foes were left to conquer. In gratitude for his
devotion and services he was beheaded by the ruling dynasty and,
through sympathy, ; his two devoted followers took their lives and
were burled with their .beloved leader. fffyyf
As we stepped into the street the brilliantly lighted roof gardens,
decorated ln true Oriental style, attracted our attention. It Is a bit
of Importation from the Far , East, most picturesque and attractive
to the Occidental eye. Every piece of shrubbery and verdure is in
miniature. Dwarf of, great age rest in diminutive jars, with
their gnarled and twisted trunks a.nd branches, presenting a most
grotesque and interesting sight to the experienced Western horti
culturist. Above each building floats the national ensign of China
the Dragon and j the ; Pearl. Â Here is another bit of legendary lore."
From the dragon, which is a heavenly body, presumably descended
the rulers of the empire.' The dragon is supposed to be the embodi
ment of all wisdom and learning. Just before his distended Jaws is
what appears to the uninitiated a ball of fire. It is a pearl, the recog
nized gem of the Orient. This pearl is symbolical of all his con
centrated energy, which he keeps constantly in view, that mankind
may not be deprived -of the wisdom of heaven, which is annually
transmitted to the 'sages who dwell upon the earth.
From the homes of . the - opulent ;we force . our way through the
crowd of merrymakers along Dupont to Jackson street, finally reach
ing the very heart of the ragpickers' quarter. How fare the poor on
this Joyous holiday? -Alas, it is the same the, world overâ "they are
always with us." . ' . :f')'y:
Follow along this . noisome, reeking alley, . descend this creaking
stairway and stand, as it were, In the very bowels of the earth. Here
Is Charlie, the pickpocket, with ; his cat, which, like its master,. ls an
opium fiend. Charlie :is â¢â  opulent to-night. â ' We have .to do with worse
than mere poverty, with wretchedness and squalor and black misery.
Descending yet : lower >we enter a _ subcellar : reeking and foul. In a
narrow, brick-walled * cell 'â  we find old Wong Sing, once king of the
ragpickers,* stretched upon a shred of clean matting in deference to
the day, inhaling opium." Sing Is, reticent at the outset and seems ,to
resent the Intrusion- of the Western barbarian. When addressed in
his own language, â  however, the old man gradually grows loquacious
and seems Inclined to answer questions and to chat quite comfortably
on the subject of the â¢ hour. 'â  y --ryfyi
'In deference to his' age ; I addressed him. as; "O,! father." ,
â¢ This seems to please the old man. The gift â¢of several nickels
added, to his. good nature. He arose with ; dignity and asked me to
translate his thanks to the young man of the = nickels. ,
"O, son!" he exclaimed, "does this man speak our language?"
"No," I answered, "he understands not a word of the: classics."
. "But surely he is a scholar and well-mannered, for he is kind

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1899.
Out of this foul dungeon, the very walls of which are reeking with
slime so suggestive â¢ of . perspiration, we find " ourselves once more in
the brilliantly lighted streets: It is refreshing to breathe something
like pure air again. .Each moment the highways are becoming, more
crowded and the color effect more confusing. Silks and satins of _
every imaginable hue, woven in the most gorgeous designs, shaped .in !
the long graceful gown of the Confucian scholar worn by merchant
prince and house servant alike, make up a scene one need not expect
to witness in any other part of the civilized world. ' â¢..'.'
The din is becoming frightful. Long festoons of 'firecrackers, ex
, tending, . ln : some cases," from ; the roofs of buildings to the very street
below, make a racket : that would enthuse the heart of any American
boy with an < ounce iof Fourth of July in" his makeup.
We are obliged to pick our way carefully and keep a sharp eye
skyward ; Ins order .to ? avoid ? the loads of fireworks that are thrown
from windows and housetops. Not a 1 word of complaint do we hear;
no one seems offended, all are determined to have a good time.

â¢ â¢' iss"ue orders directing movements. He
f . shrank at first from any such action,
â¢â '. because as he very frankly owned he
" knew nothing about military matters,
. and he did not want to embarrass his
. â -â¢â.*' generals. He was made the more sensi
f,'.''^tJTeon this point because the flrst great

"â¢â¢'â  Scott. For- several months after Bull

"It was. fully six months after he ap

fear. ' â¢â :â¢â

"'lt* was one of the peculiar customs of the Apache Indians to give i
much as you could, ln which you
did a great wrong to the country
and to a most meritorious and hon
orable brother officer. I have
heard, in such a way as to believe
it, of your recently saying that
both the army and the Government
needed a dictator.
Of course, it was not for this, but
in spite of it, that I have given you
the command. Only those generals
who gain successes can set up dic
tators. What I now ask of you la
military success, and I will risk the
dictatorship. The Government will
support you to the utmost of Its
ability, which is neither more nor
less than lt has done and will do ,
for all commanders. I much fear
that the spirit which you have aid
ed to infuse into the army, of crlti
cizling their commander and with
holding confidence from him, will
now turn upon you. I shall assist
you as far as: I con to put it down.
Neither you nor Napoleon, if he
were alive again, could get any
good out of an army while such a
spirit prevails In It; and now be
ware of rashness. Beware of rash
ness, but with energy and Bleep
less vigilance go forward and give
us victories. Yours very truly,
A. LINCOLN.
Hooker had a, manly heart and the
. President's words appealed to the beet
that was In him. Noah Brooks tells
how he heard the general read the let
ter soon after its receipt. "He finished
reading it," writes Brooks, "almost
with tears in his eyes; and as he folded
lt and put it back in the breast of his
coat he said: 'That is Just such a letter
as a father might write to a son. It
is a beautiful - letter, and although I
think he was harder on me than I de
served, I will say -that I love the man
who wrote It.' "
Throughout the war Mr. Lincoln waa
beset by his generals to right their
wrongs and gratify their ambitions. He
was quick to see the motives at the
bottom of complaints and pleas and
when he thought them petty he bluntly
said so, at the same time reminding the
applicants that winning battles, not
haggling for honors, was a soldier's
business Just then. Thus in March,
1863, Rosecrans became disturbed be
cause Grant outranked him and he
wrote Lincoln asking that his commis
sion be dated earlier. Lincoln at once
saw the reason of the request and he
replied:
"Now as to your request that your
commission should date from Decem
ber, 1861. Of course, you expected to
gain something by this; but you should
remember that precisely so much as
you should gain by it others would lose
by It. If the thing you sought had been
exclusively ours, we would have given
it cheerfully; but, being the right of
other men, we having a merely arbi
trary power over It, the taking it from
them and giving it to you becomes a
more delicate matter and more deserv
ing of consideration. Truth to speak, I
do not appreciate this matter of rank
on paper as you officers do. The world
will not forget that you fought the bat
tle of Stone River, and it will never
care a fig whether you rank General
Grant, on paper, or he so ranks you."
When it happened, as it sometimes
did, that the Jealousies between gen
erals became open conflicts, and Lin
coln was called upon by one or the oth
er to Interfere, he never hesitated to
refuse if he felt that his interference
would complicate matters. Generally
he managed to put Into his refusal a
word of good sense which if it had been
heeded would have saved the country
much disagreeable scandal and often
would have saved the contestant his
reputation. A case to the point occurred
in. January, 1863, when McClernand and
Halleck were having trouble and Mc-
Clernand appealed to Lincoln. The
President's reply was terse but suffi
cient:
"I have too many family controver
sies, so to speak, already on my hands
to voluntarily, or so long as I can avoid
it, take up another. You are now doing
well well for the country and well for
yourself much better than you could
possibly be if engaged in open war with
General Halleck. Allow me to beg that,
for your sake, for my sake, and for your
country's sake, you give your whole at
tention to the better work."
It would not be difficult to extend
these quotations to great length, for
throughout the war the President
showed the same patience and good
sense in cases where it seemed to him
that his counsels might be useful. He
never spared. those to whom he wrote;
ooooooooooooooooco

offenses and their base motives, but he .

a "thanks" dance whenever they felt satisfied with their provisions
and supplies. They were especially grateful that day because I had
made and presented each of them with a valentine a piece of heart
shaped cardboard covered with red paper; and so they prolonged
their dancing on that day for my benefit.
It was also one of their customs to wear human hair as a sort of
tassel to be suspended from their belts; and of all hair light hair was
considered the greatest bit of ornamentation that they could secure.
Unfortunatelyâ for my own peace of mind after this dateâ my
hair was red. the very shade that filled the red warriors with envy.
However, I sat there blissfully unconscious that I was being watched;
that an Apache chief was even then seriously plotting the rape of my
locks. â  . â¢
The Indian dance grew more noisy, and their wild gesticulations
filled me with a horrible fascination â a fantastic alarm. Suddenly
a great form darkened my window and stood by my side. He was
so close that I could feel his hot breath on my cheek. He drew an
awful-looking knife from his belt, and, grabbing the forelock from
his own head, he pantomimed , the scalping process, then motioned
to my head. I understood, I thought, all too wellâ he meant to scalp
me. With one wild shriek I grabbed my daughter and ran screaming
through the house. V"":f " â ;
My cries brought some of the soldiers ln, and they soon found my
bold admirer just where I had left him. He had not stirred from the
window, and told them in his language that he only wanted my hair'
to hang from his belt. He said he would pay me for lt, and was sur
prised that I would not sell it to him.
That scene was sufficient to last me during my four years' resi
dence in that desolate region, and I never ventured far from the quar
ters' unless attended by some of the soldiers. ' That experience was
enough for me, and I avoided lonely trails ever afterward.

had ; occasion to remember a Valentine day that will abide with me

LOUIS JAMES. \ as the church' to which our family be
longed was considered too sacred for
<^ â : : â¦ childish oratory I was not allowed in the
pulpit. One day I broke away from my mother during the sermon
and joined the elders in their exhortations. I was : taken from this
usurped footstool in humility by my parents and so that day, after
church was over and we had all gone, I concluded to steal back again
and preach my little sermon all to myself. " ' :
The church, door I found locked and there was but one way to
gain entrance, namely, to break . the window- with a rock, then I
might give vent to my religious enthusiasm undisturbed. I broke the
window and 'crawled in, , but my fond parents soon , discovered me. I
was taken home to be punished. - After this severe lesson had been
administered I decided to have revenge. I down and thought it
all out and at last I concluded to set our neighbor's house on fire.
She had been the means of having me whipped only the day be
foreâbecause I had let her- chickens out of 'the coop. I sat down and
calmly figurd out a little list of wrongs and determined- to get even.
> The neighbor's house made a glorious bonfire. That night found
it charred embers.
â¢ After the excitement had subsided my father called me Into his
bedroom and a great noise was heard. Not screams or groans, but a
steady soundâ like that of continued applause after the curtain has
rung down on a good act. Yes, it was more like ceaseless ap
plause than anything" else. That all happened on Valentine's day.

various theaters, and some of It was bad indeed.
In the first scene of "Othello" the stage fis set for Brabantio's
home. ' This* theater furnished us a "set house," a common painted
scene of a cottage with a chimney in the center, one window just be
neath it and one door. '.

Finally Brabantio made his . appearance, but it nearly sent us
into convulsions; for Instead of appearing at . the window his head
and shoulders towered above the chimney. The excruciating part rof
it all was that he didn't notice that he had made a mistake, and read
his lines from the chimney top with a dignity that was torturing to
the actors below. ,::.:..
The audience didn't catch on until Brabantlo attempted to make
an entrance through the door, which was five: feet high. He had to
fold himself together in such a manner to get through that they

There is in existence a draft. of a let
ter dated September 25, 1863, and ad-,
dressed to General A. E. Burnside, in
which Lincoln reviews the daily prom
ises that the general had been making
to move to the aid of Rosecrans, then
shut up in Chattanooga; and his steady
move "the contrary .way." When the
President wrote the document he evi
dently felt that Burpside's own reports
were the severest witnesses against
him, for in his opening sentence he de
clared that Burnslde's conduct made*
him "doubt whether he was, awake or
dreaming." Yet Justified as he un
doubtedly felt he was when he wrote
the letter, he never sent It. He held It,
hoping as he always did that something
would happen to make it unnecessary.
The events of the next few weeks out
lawed this particular document and lt
exists to-day simply as a proof of Lin
coln's unwillingness to . criticize and
advise unnecessarily.
Although so uniformly kind even in
his rebukes, there is more than one.
case on record where President Lin
coln's patience failed and he sent a
telegram of bitter sarcasm to a general.
Such was his message to McClellan on
October 24, 1862, when that general,
after five Idle weeks; refused to pursue
the enemy because his cavalry horses
had sore tongues. It was a drop too
much for Lincoln.
"1 have Just read your dispatch about
â ore-tongued and fatigued horses," he
wired. * Will you not pardon me for ask
ing what the horses of your army have
done since the battle of Antietam that
fatigues anything?" .>
Yet even for this telegram he half
apologized two days later.
"Most certainly I Intend no Injustice
to any, and if I have done any I deeply
regret lt. To be" told, after more than
five weeks' total Inaction of the army,
and during which period we have sent
to the army every fresh horse we pos
sibly could, amounting ln the whole to
7918, that the cavalry horses were too
much fatigued to move, presents a very
cheerless, almost hopeless, prospect for
the future, and lt may have forced
something of impatience ln my dis
patch."
. One pleasant feature of Mr. Lincoln's
relations to his generals was the heart
iness with which he acknowledged
every advance. r "God bless you and
your army" * was the gist of many a
telegram, many a verbal message that
he sent. , Perhaps of all these congrat
ulatory messages none ls pleasanter
reading ln the light of later events
than the President's letter to General
Grant after Vicksburg. In a way it
may be called Lincoln's first recogni
tion of Grant:
Major General Grantâ Dear
General: I do not remember that
you and - I have ever met personal
ly. I write this now as a grateful
acknowledgment for the almost
Inestimable service you have done
- the country. I wish to say a word
further. When you flrst reached
the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought
you should do what you finally did
âmarch the troops across the neck,
run the batteries with the trans
ports, and- thus go below; and I
never had any faith, except a gen
eral hope that you knew better
than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedi
tion and the like could succeed.
When you got below and took Port
Gibson, Grand Gulf and vicinity, I
thought you should go down the
river and Join General Banks, and
when you turned northward, east ,'
of the Big Black, I feared it was a ..
mistake. I now wish to make the
personal acknowledgment that you
were right and I was wrong. Yours
very. truly. A LINCOLN.
Comparatively little of these close re
lations of Lincoln with his generals
was known to the public during the
war. It was not until twenty years
after his death, when his secretaries,
Messrs. Nlcolay and Hay, .published
their great work, which must remain
through all time the most important
source for the history of Abraham Lin
coln that the greater number of these
wise, keen, kind letters were given to
the public. ,',;',

Major White was an officer of the
Alabama . State Guard at the outbreak
of the war and under orders of the
executive of the State took part with
his command in the capture of Fort
Morgan, Mobile Bay, before Alabama
had formally seceded from the Union.
When It was reported to President Lin
coln that his brother-in-law had per
formed this daring exploit against the
national authority, on being asked what .
he would do about It he replied:
"Well, I suppose I shall have to hang
Whiteâ when we catch. him."
Major White later performed many
distinguished military and civil servi
ces for the Confederacy. B3_
It was while Mr. White was attending
college at Lexington, Ky., that he met
and fell ln love with Mattle Todd, the
sister of Mrs. Lincoln. One summer
White went with a brother of Mattle
Todd and another friend to pass his va
cation at the Todd mansion. The dis
tance was only twenty-eight miles, but
the train was four hours in making the
trip. To add to the discomfort of the
trip one of the party was crowded on a
bench occupied by an awkward-looking
countryman, his wife and two children.
The children whined and .cried nearly
all the way. On reaching the Frank
fort home they started to recount their
experiences on the train.
"I was serenaded all the way by a
couple of squalling babies," said one.
"The father of them was the ugliest
white man I ever saw, and the children
were the crossest brats I have Been."
There was an interruption, a turning
of heads, and the gaunt, ugly passen
ger, wife and children, came - Into the
room. In his . arms was the boy who
has since figured in this country's an
nals as Robert T. Lincoln. â¢
Lincoln enjoyed the joke. He was on
his way to Washington as a Congress
man from Illinois. "He was so enters â¢
taining sympathetic and > lively," said -
Major White, "that we soon forgot that
his features were not handsome."
After his marriage, Major White set
tled at Selma, Ala., where he inherited
a thriving business and a large proper
ty from his father. As a girl, Mattle
Todd became a great favorite of Lin
coln. At the time of the inauguration,
In company with her husband, she
stopped at the White House. Her visits
to Washington were frequent, and .as
Lincoln did not wish the war to inter
rupt them he gave her a pass which
would admit her through the lines at
any point she chose. After crossing,
the Virginia line on a return from a
visit an inspector followed Mrs. White
to a hotel where she stopped, and .In
sisted on examining her baggage. The
officer was dismissed at the point of her
pistol. On opening her trunk she was
amazed to find that friends ln Balti
more had stowed away there a splendid
sword and a suit of uniform for General*
Robert E. Lee.
At first Mrs. White thought lt best to
return to Washington and explain the
whole matter to Lincoln, but her heart
was really in the cause of the South,
and she felt that General Lee probably
needed the uniform. On hÂ«r arrival at
, Richmond she consulted President Da
, vis, whom she knew as well as Lincoln,
and asked his opinion. He decided that
'General Lee must have the presents,
and wrote with. his own hand the de
tails to Mr. Lincoln. The great man
: at the White House often twitted Mrs.
White about her contretemps.
Major White declares that lt was not
the wish or intention of the people of
Alabama to secede from the Union. He
says that he believes If Lincoln's "err
â¢ ing sister" programme had been adopted
there would have been no civil war, and
the emancipation of the slaves would
have been brought about by gradual
and rational means. The old gentle
man's reminiscences embrace many in
teresting phases of the unwritten his
tory of the war, but no man has a
stronger feeling for the Union and the
integrity of the government than he.
His voice trembled with emotion as
he told of the destruction of his prop
erty during the war, and then he re
verted to the history of some of the
men who grew to be popular leaders in
the' war.'.'yf\ -.+ . a TEAR ago at a curiosity shop in Venice I bought a silver â¦

model. To this spot, a century ago, came three ladleÂ© feasting with their
gallants, and being mirthful, they pledged Diana in Malvolsle, one of them
calling her a saucy jade to stand thus half naked before thÂ© men, and
dashed some wine in the statue's face, which presently, while the revelers
looked on startled and silent, flushed faintly beneath the glistening drops.
The mark whereof lt keeps to this dayâ eangue di Diana, cry the women;
thÂ© chemical Juice of the grape, think the men; flecks of metallic rust in
thÂ© marble, say I.
In thÂ© silence of that early morning, rippled only by thÂ© twittering of
birds, Portia still slept thÂ© fevered sleep of the heavy hearted, while for
an Instant her fancy, so she says, flew to the familiar scenes of Venice,
and amid the Imagined brilliance of Its dustless air she beheld again thÂ©
transcendent pinnacles of jasper and carbuncle, the alabaster fretwork of
its arches, and thÂ© sculptured fountains and mosaics of its palaces. And
beyond many shining facades she saw beforÂ© St. Mark's thÂ© sunlit piazza
with steps russet-stained and crusted, till upon the crisp breeze, touched
with the fragrance of tiny gardens, came the rhythmed pealing of mon
astery bells that swelled to strains of musicâ and at Its sound she Instinct
ively awoke, conscious that there. is- no more significant ill-omen than
music heard in dreams.
At this same hour Bassanio, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, rose
.Irom his couch at thÂ© other extremity of the building, and, having dressed
himself in thÂ© garments he had thrown off some hours before, opened wido
his casement and leaned against the balcony. His face was haggard with

William Waldorf Astor, while United

adorns Mr. tAstor's palace of Cliveden,

Italian looking-glasses. It is nothing less

furtive dismayâ a curious transformation from the radiant lover of two
weeks before. Upon the horizon stood the wind-swept Dolomites, with a
peep upon the sapphire dome of Antelao, ar.d near by the red walls of
Padua, and at his feet the glistening Brenta. In the garden below,
lounging on a bench, was the page Pipistrello. fanning himself like an
effeminate coxcomb with one of Jessica's fans, glancing about with
stealthy, half-closed eyes. Then Bassanio withdrew unnoticed into his
room, and Lorenzo, whose knocking had been unheeded, heard him mut
ter, "Fool ! fool !'.' - ; yyy
Antonio, upon his arrival an hour later, was led whither Portia await
ed. He was shocked at her appearance, the suave and happy girl suddenly
transformed to a pale, careworn, dangerous-looking woman. What ill be
ginning had they made, this fair young husband and wife, the pride and
jewel of Venice! She addressed him as one able to save Bassanio and her
self from an evil she was evidently at a loss to define, but which she in
dicated in hurried, sentences. - .-*
On their wedding night Bassanio had retired to his room and she had
not seen him again till late the following day, when his agitation sur- '
prised her. Venetian brides are not usually shown the cold shoulder in
such summary fashion. Was he ill or troubled by evil news? â  No, but he
had passed a bad night; and after this answer and half an hour's careless
talk, lapsed into an extraordinary lassitude and dejection. From Gratiano
and Lorenzo she learned that upon going to his room he had dismissed his
personal attendants, keeping only the page Pipistrello. to whom he was
overheard giving orders for the morrow. But these orders proved lengthy,
for the page was there all night; and for hours Jessica, listening at the key
hole, caught sounds of eager talking, of striding up and down, of sobbing-)
until at length all was still, and in the morning the page, who had appa
rently slept upon a sofa in the anteroom, came out and walked away.
"And who." asked Portia, "is this Pipistrello?" A youth Lorenzo ha 4
taken into his service in Venice and brought hither, and who since then
would have been dismissed had he not suddenly and unaccountably trans
ferred his attendance to Bassanio. The second night was a repetition
of the first, except that the talking had been briefer. Pipistrello had again
slept in Bassanlo's antechamber, and on the morrow that odd husband
went away alone to ramble about the fields. Then Portia angrily sum
moned this Intrusive page upon whom she had never before cast eyes, and
having made him swear before a graven Image, questioned him for an
hour. Who was he? Why had he left Lorenzo's service? Why thrust
himself unbidden upon Bassanlo's? Had he aught to answer to Lorenzo's
bad opinion? What business had he in her husband's room at night?
Pipistrello presented himself with perfect self-possession, betrayed no
uneasiness during a searching interrogatory, and replied plausibly to
every question. His bearing was faultless, he was evidently of superior
education, and the sharpest feminine sallies failed to disturb his equanim
ity. His Justification, such as it was, seemed made with frankness and
with that deferential tone to which all women are sensible. It began to
appear so unreasonable to blame this sweet-mannered lad for his master's
vagaries that Portia at length found herself listening with complaisance
to the vicissitudes of a troubled life. Her own personal resources having
thus failed, like a rational woman she summoned Almodoro.
Of this famous mathematician I need only say that he is the subtlest
of all our learned men, and that his application of a curious theory of
lines and angles to the intimate affairs of life has to my own knowledge
produced astounding revelations. He brought with him to Belmonte his
familiar, which is of so odd a nature that l have seen it In his pocket, ln
form like a scarabaeus covered with forbidden symbols; though again at
Cyprus, riding with him one morning amid the sun-flecked woods, when
the day came slanting over the crags, we heard a sound far away amid
the hills, faint and remote as those imagined voices the fancy hears be
fore the waking, and turning to me with a smile, he pointed thither as
who should say. Lo. it is there! So, having been instructed by letter, he
presented himself in the guise of an Oriental merchant at the Villino be
side the Brenta where Lorenzo lodged.
While Jessica bargained with him for his turban, a cup of carmine lip
salve and a game of cards, he noticed, standing by as they sat eating, that
Pipistrello used a fork, whereas Jessica thrust her fingers in the dish, that
the page's flute, whereof we have heard so much, lay on the table:
and divined from certain unfailing tokens that they shared between them
some secret essential to his errand. Then after Almodoro had been twenty
four hours at Belmonte, working with demoniac activity, and unaware of
Antonio's arrival.' he sought Portia unannounced in the room to which
Antonio had been brought half an hour before. They both turned toward
him in silent expectation, reading as he entered something of urgent im
port upon his usually impassive face. -'^^iS^!!SSS0 :a isesi9iM^^^vSS^* ail^KSf^i
He did not wait to be questioned. "I have discovered three things,""*
he began, with a quiet little ironical smile, "the first of which is that
Pipistrello is a woman." - â -â  .
Antonio's heart beat at this, and Portia listened ' with silent emotion
to an announcement which explained so much while casting so grave a
reproach upon her husband. Almodoro eyed his client with quizzical in-"

and glancing: from one to the other. _, , .
"And lastly," continued Almodoro, "my instruments have disclosed
thÂ© existence of a secret panel in Bassanlo's room, which delicacy forbade
my opening." _,â â ' â  , . .
"A secret panel ln my own house that I never knew of! ejaculated
Portia; and desiring Antonio to await her return, she beckoned Almodoro
to follow. ,v: .. â 
Bassanlo's room, which they entered, is one that has been occupied
by successive owners of Belmonte, one or two of whom have left upon lt
traces of their individual tastes. At one side, facing two windows, is a
great walnut bed with carved figures; between the casements is a dressing
table with mirror and perfumes and brushes and ointments; at one side,
between candles and holy water, opens an oratory niche with prie-dleu
and Madonna; in the center are elaborately cushioned but uncomfortable
chairs, and before them a table whereon, when I saw it, the contents of
a leather writing case parchment, ink vial, seals, wax and quillsâ had
been emptied; there was also a tapestry screen, a richly inlaid ebony cab
inet, a lute suspended against the wall, and an ivory figure representing
a girl preparing for the bath.
The wise man conducted Portia directly to the niche which his treasure
magnet had detected, and at sight of its contents her outstretched hand
trembled, and the magician's swarthy face flushed. But a glance showed
that the objects before them could not have been used by the living gen
eration. They were all covered with the dust of many years. There was
a small crystal vase containing the shriveled remnants of a flower: a
sheathless stiletto, crusted with stains; a silk purse of sequins; a case of
vials whose contents were variously Intended to restore the hair and the
complexion; an empty blue bottle, such as has been known to hold a
poison orTfs antidote; a little box filled with love lozenges, and a Pf-<*?t
of letters,. yellow < with age, and tied with a ragged satin band. Portia .
knew, that these things must have belonged to her grandmother or blessed
memory, whose room this had been sixty years ago, who in her time had
been a famous beauty, who had been left a young widow under dramatic â¢
circumstances, who was very religious and had caused the oratory to be-:
made. The packet contained twenty letters, written by various masculine
hands, only one being in a woman's delicate chirography; this Portia un-.
folded and found to be a memorandum written by her grandmother on her .
sixteenth birthday, setting forth sixteen good resolvesâ with an indorse- .
ment made thirty years later, to the effect that every one of these purposes, -
had been thwarted. Quite apart lay the miniature of a child whose face,
was unfamiliar to Portia, although it bore a marked family resemblance. '
Whose child, she wondered, could it have been? â¢ "
"It is like opening a grave." whispered Portia to the mathematician at
her side; then closing the panel, which adjusted Itself with a sharp snao,
she murmured, "Let us leave those musty secrets to themselves and pass
to the matter more immediately concerning us."
Thus challenged, Almodoro pointed to an amber set of chessmen drawn â¢
up ln battle array upon their board, and remarked: "The supreme activi- .
ties of life bear an analogy to the pure forces of that exercise. In each
are found the refinements of abstract thought, the graceful subtleties of
finesse the decisive attributes of power. A pungent lesson of each is to
show the fool's blunder punished and the masterstroke rewarded. In
chess the results derived from position correspond with like consequences .
produced in life by the Intelligent grouping of circumstances. The climax
âwhether on the chessboard or in a situation such as yoursâ deter
mined by some dominating condition that governs all the others. If. for
example, we can bring a pawn to the eighth square and exchange it for
a queen; or if in a struggle for life or reputation we can make a thrust.

Portia and Almodoro were so long gone that Antonio, was not sorry
when a servant approached to say his master had just learned of his ar
rival and wished to see him in the Marble Gallery; so thither Antonio .
went, smiling at this bridegroom who would not even traverse that quar- â¢â 
ter of the house his wife occupied. * â¢
Bassanlo's morning reverie had brought him to an Imperative resolve,
which he lost no time In communicating. Motioning Antonio to a seat, he.
began almost without the prelude of a salutation. _â  . â¢ '
"How strange a fate gave Portia to me and ruined her life, when the
same chance might as readily have bestowed her upon any one of a dozen
other suitors!" Then, with a passionate gesture unusual to his gentle
calm, he added. "Marriedâ yet not married!â is the story. '
"Not married?" echoed the other, gazing earnestly into Bassanio a
eyes and comprehending how ominous an apparition confronted his friend .
in the person of Pipistrello. "Married and yet not married!' What then, â¢
had become of Bassanlo's adoration of Portia? And Antonio tells ma he
felt more than ever before the truth of our . trite saying that one love â¢
swallows another as fish devour their like ln the sea. Then, if only for
the sake of rousing Bassanio to reason, he piled him with question upon
question. apKPfffSÃfc. , , â¢ _..- ...
Portia's husband laid his hand upon Antonio's, and speaking with the;
deliberation of one brought to bay by such a stern emergency as may â¢
confront any man in a lifetime, answered: '"_,_!"" â¢
"Two years ago I met the lady known to you as Pipistrello. "She.was ,
betrothed to another, andâ censure me as you mayâ and I left Venice, â¢

"It is true," assented Bassanio gravely, "that I have sent Pipistrello .

"It would be far better to send her this very day to Venice." .
"I mean to take her there this very day myself." ' :

to their curious entanglement with Shylock. But to an old man it will
be forgiven if in-each brave and beautiful Venetian girl .appears the re
flected type of Venice. And musing upon Pipistrello's fate I have pictured
her in happier days, habited in maidenly attire, kneeling in the shadow.,
of St. Mark's golden arches, whispering. her secrets to the Madonna;- 1
fancy her on the festa of the boccolo receiving the rosebud that breathes,
an admirer's passion: I see her brought to bay by fate. and overborne, and
I cannot but believe that such valiant hearts are our guardian angels. -.
Their hasty talk had gone no farther when it was interrupted by- the
majordomo. He looked strangely discomposed, and stammered that -a
violent alarm had come from Lorenzo's Villino. and that, in the absence, of
a physician. Almodoro was being everywhere sought. Jessica had. sud
denly been taken dangerously ill. They rushed to. the wise mans room,
where he lav asleep on a Turkish camp couch, taking his habitual morn-,
Ing siesta, from which he awoke as lightly a? a startled hound. â¢ Upon
being told what had happened he became curiously uneasy, and talcing
something from a traveling wallet which he kept carefully locked at once
followed them. ' â  'â _ . 'â â ;'â  ... _ -.-b,w.->i_,*
They found Jessica in convulsions, and Lorenzo holding a crumpled
letter which bade him give a certain basket of peaches. "to Pipistrello. The
pretended page was away in the woods with her flute, Lorenzo had been
with Bassanio. and in the interval that greedy hussy had eaten two - of.
the peaches. The astrologer instantly poured something down Jessica s
throat, after which she became better, whereupon he decampd without
waiting for explanations. He seemeed preoccupied and Irritable, and left
the Villino abruptly. striding away none knew whither, and was seen there

with a sword-thrust through the ribs, still grasping the blades with which,
he had wounded both assailants. Pipistrello. who in the midst of these
various excitements spent the day al fresco, did not return, as it was ex

a higher percentage of sugar.
Growers from all over the State have
ordered from $50 to $500 worth of graft

immense industry this fruit will create.
For the Burbank plum and the su
gar prune alone, America, and Califor
nia in particular, should be deeply
grateful to Luther Burbank. But count
less other fruits, flowers and vegetables
must be credited to his wizard-like in
genuity. It is hard, indeed, to realize
that aught but a wizard's wand brings
about such marvelous changes.
He planted a tiny seed in the spring
of 1876, and from that seed he gathered
three and a quarter pounds of the most
beautiful white potatoes that ever grew
on a potato vine. The tubers were
planted and replanted, and when the
second season had passed two tons was
the crop which a prominent Eastern
seedsman purchased and introduced to
the public. The "Burbank potato" soon
became known all over America and
abroad. More than 200,000,000 bushels
of the Burbank potato are now grown
every year. Mr. Burbank made just $150
from this potato. The seedsman who
bought it from him made almost half a
million.
But the people in Marblehead, Mass.,
are raising funds to erect a monument
to Mr. Burbank on the spot where he
planted the tiny seed that has since
produced enough to feed a nation.
His success with the potato shaped
Mr. Burbank's career. Although born
and reared on a large farm ln Massa
chusetts, he was sent when 18 years old
to learn wood turning and pattern mak
ing. His love of nature would not al
low him to endure the dust and con
finement of the shop.
He sought out Agassiz, and from the
lips of the master himself Luther Bur
bank learned the secret of unraveling
the seeming mysteries of nature. Cali
fornia, with Its abundance of sunshine,
seemed to be the land of golden prom
ise for his labors, so to Santa Rosa
came this savant.
On the slopes near Sebastopol he
bought fifteen acres of land and com

TREE THAT Gf.VE BIG PLUMS TO THE WORLD.
This tree bore the first Burbank plumâ the plum that revolutionized the
plum trade. It is a hybrid plum, a combination of the best qualities of the
American and Japanese varieties. Burbank plum trees are now growing all
over the world. The plums are larger and as superior to the original Amer
ican plum as an apple is superior to a potato. Cecil Rhodes planted 10,000
Burbank plums In South Africa, and they have borne as abundantly there as
in their native soil.

a lily with the delicate tints of a tea
rose and the odor of a Parma violet.
Next summer the fragrant Lemon
Giant will bloom in many a garden ln
the East, as well as ln California.
The lily is not the only flower of the
field which Mr. Burbank has consid

has paled to more delicate tints or has
blushed to deeper hue. And not only
is the rose fairer to look upon, but it

LUCKY STRIKES OF GREEN MINERS.
IT is a curious fact that the discover
ies of rich gold and silver deposits In
Colorado have been made, with few
exceptions, by men who had little or no
knowledge of mining or mineralogy.
Rank tenderfeet have stumbled upon for
tunes which experienced prospectors had
trodden upon for years and neglected in
their wisdom. 'b -,
The lucky strike over at the new Daw
son City illustrates the truth of ' this
statement. The Dawsons came from
crop-raising Kansas about a year ago,
and sank a shaft in search of copper on
one of the Greenhorn hills," named so by
those who thought that none but- green
horns would look for mineral there. They
found nothing of value after going down
about forty feet, and abandoned the hole
until last- month,, when they started to
tunnel some distance below it. The pros
pect looked brighter, and they decided to
put up a cabin. While excavating, the
side of the hill to make room for It,
young Dawson chipped, off a bit of rock
full of free gold. Following up his find,
Dawson discovered an unusually large
and rich vein, from which samples were
taken. One piece of ore assayed $4324 and
another gave the enormous value of $I_,
--418 to the ton. .The discovery was a case
of luck, and nothing else.
"It beats . the deuce, these lucky finds
by people who hardly know enough to
keep away from a blast," growled an old
timer who had come down from Cripple
Creek to get in on a good thing if possi
ble. Other mining men agreed with him,
and many instances were cited to prove
that luck was the most, lmportant thing
to have in search for mineral wealth.
Among them was mentioned the Little
Johnny at Leadville. - In the winter . of
1879-80 three ladsâ John Curran, â¢â  Thomas
Kelly and James H. Donovanâ left Ga
lena. 111., and went to Leadville, where
they dug away six feet of snow on Breece
to put up a cabin. In this they froze and
starved all winter. . Young Kelly died
Burbank passed his hands over Its
sweet petals. , .
He has sold several of his roses for
from $500 to $1000 apiece. He is ex
perimenting with the yellow rose, try
ing to evolute a perpetual hybrid yel
low rose that will stand the Eastern
winters. Hinsdale Perkins of New
York, the most prominent seedsman in
America, will give him $10,000 on the
day that he receives the first blossom
of this yellow rose.
Cannas and clematis have arrayed
themselves in the delicate tints of the
rainbow for Mr. Burbank, just as the
from illness brought on by exposure and
privation, and was soon followed by Cur
ran, after whom the mine was named.
Donovan is still living. They knew noth
ing about mining, located their claim hap
hazard, and yet discovered one of the
""'chest gold mines in the world. But
Kelly s heirs are said to have sold their
,Â£Â£?Â£ f^b only $1000, and the Currans
for $2500. The amount Donovan got is un
known. .
How much the Dillon brothers, Pat and
Dick, knew about mining, metallurgy and
mineralogy when they: discovered the
great silver ore body of the Little Chief
at Leadville in the winter of 1878-79 no one
seems to know. When they located their
claim It was regarded by the other miners
as barren ground, and they were laughed
at by many who thought that mining was
an exact science. Judging from this, the
Dillons did not know much. They had an
idea, however, that the experience ot
Rische and Hook with the Little I Pitts
burg could be repeated; so they dug away
and waited for their turn to laugh. At a
comparatively shallow depth the rich ore
was struck In such an immense body that
the Dillons and their partner, Peter Fin
nerty, speedily became wealthy men. In
less than two years the Dillons had run
through more than $600,000, the product of
their Little Chief and other claims, and
were nearly broke. Dick Dillon is now
working in Cripple Creek as a miner at
$3 a day. Pat Dillon kept his money bet
ter, and made some good investments in
Cripple Creek, and is reported to be worth
$150,000. He lives on a big ranch in Cali
fornia. Flnnerty was the shrewdest of
the three, and has accumulated $250,000.
The very best mines in the Cripple Creek
district were discovered by poor men who
had luck and good muscles Instead of
capital and a scientific : education. Win
field Scott Stratton, who located the fa
mous Independence mine, had always
been a carpenter, and . never got rich fol
lowing his trade. It was nearly a year
after the great rush to Cripple Creek that

he picked out the group where the mine
is located. He had seen the ledge a hun
dred times before he located it, and oth
ers with greater or less experience as
miners had seen and examined it a thou
sand times and passed it by just as he
had. No one. not even Stratton, asserts
that the discovery of the Independence
was anything but pure luck. He happened
to be fortune's favorite at the time.
The experience of Jimmy Doyle, the
millionaire Mayor of Victor, in the Crip
ple Creek district, also illustrates the ele
ment of luck In mine finding in Colorado.
Doyle, who had learned the carpenter
trade but did not follow It, was driving a
hack in Manitou when the Cripple Creek
excitement began in 1891. In Colorado
Springs there was a young plumber nam
ed Jimmy Burns. The two. were acquaint
td and together they went to Cripple
Creek to try their luck. Neither knew
anything about mining. Battle Mountain,
near Victor, was then covered with loca
tion stakes. There was a piece of land
comprising about one-sixth of an acre
that had no owner because It was consid
ered worthless.' Doyle and Burns took up
this : ; land :ln the belief that something
was better than nothing.: They sent for
John Harnan, who was employed in driv
ing a street scraper in Colorado Springs,
to come and help them dig. their claim.
Harnan's mining experience consisted of
what he hadÂ« learned as. a child in pick
ing slate from the screens of Pennsyl
vania coal mines. For months the trio
put in hard work sinking a shaft with not
a sign of pay ore. Their acquaintances
sougnt to discourage them, but they per
sisted, and were rewarded by striking a
vein that made them millionaires.

WHITE BLACKBERRIES.
Mr. Burbank has been especially
fortunate with berries. Through
his efforts we have varieties of ber
ries that ripen several weeks soon

given the berry not only new and
more subtle flavors but he has
changed its color. This variety Is
known as the white blackberry; it
tastes exactly like Its dusky sis

HOW MR. BURBANK IMPROVED
THE DAISY.
The daisy has been particularly
responsive to the care and atten
tion that Mr. Burbank has be
stowed upon it. From a small,
ragged, single flower it has changed
into a large double one, each petal
perfectly regular and of creamy
whiteness. To-day this daisy is.
growing in every garden and has
supplanted the untldy-looklng
daisy of yesterday.
entirely to him. The varieties of un
usual color, great productiveness and .
unique flavors, never known among .
berries before, are the result of Mr.
Burbank's successful grafting. A â¢
blackberry dazzling white in color, but
with all the other attributes of. the '.
usual blackberry, is one of his feats.
"Walnuts and chestnuts under Mr. .
Burbank's care have lost some of their,
old-time traits that made them unde
sirable. Chestnut trees usually take
from two until six years before they
b*rar. But a chestnut which Mr. Bur
bank has evolved and sold to an East
ern flrm bears the very first year from
the grafts. Ripe nuts were found all
along the nursery road in the fall from
grafts planted in the spring. A hand
somer walnut tree than any grown
heretofore, and a more productive one
than was formerly In existence, go .to .
make up his long list of successes in
the nut line. .
The quince, although it can be grown â 
with less expense than any other fruit, .
has never been grown to any extent.
A quince is a quince the world over, .
tart, hard and limited in its useful
ness. It takes hours to cook it tender.
But Luther Burbank, after years .of
experimenting, has given to California
a new quince called the pineapple
quince. It is soft and. mellow, with the
most delicious pineapple flavor.. S. F.
Lelb, the celebrated Santa Clara or
chardist, says: "The jelly which my "
wife made from the pineapple quince
was the finest flavored jelly of any de- .
scription or from any fruit which " I
ever ate In my life."
The pineapple quince will cook tender

green. This quince will soon- be grow
ing on every hillside and valley not .
only in California, but wherever fruit
is grown.
A special edition could be filled with
the marvelous results Mr. Burbank has
accomplished with plums. The Bur
bank plum, which revolutionized the
American plum trade, Is but one of sev
eral remarkable successes.
Three years ago Mr. Burbank sent.
out the Wickson plum, named after
Professor "Wickson of the University of
California. It is called the king of
plums, and is the largest plum known
in the world and of extra quality." Last
summer the Wickson plum sold for â¢
$8 56 a box, other varieties of plums
varying in price from 40 cents to $1 30
a box.
This year the first fruit of the Climax
plum will be offered for public use. The
Climax lives up to Its name. It is even
more remarkable than the "Wickson. It
ripens here about July 12, before any.
other good plum, neariy a month be
fore the Wickson, and is just as de
licious as the King of Plums.
But the remarkable, almost startling,
fact about the Climax Is. that it. has j
a strong perfume as delicious as that
of the sweetest scented flower. People â¢â 
who saw it last summer say that a
whole house is perfumed with a. single ..
fruit. _, ,_
The Bartlett plum ls Mr. Burbank .;
latest success. . It tastes exactly like â¢
a Bartlett pear, only it is better than .
the best Bartlett year that ever grew.-. â¢"
In twenty-five years Mr. Burbank â¢
has done twenty-five times as much as
most workers In his line accomplish
in a lifetime. Yet this wizard" of hor
ticulture works on most natural lines. .
"Education" is the potent factor
which he uses. Plants, he says,' like ..
human beings, respond to educative -.
forces. He gives them new environ., .
ments, more sunshine, an abundance of -
room, and, like human beings, slowly â¢
their new surroundings affect â  their â  â 
growth. In a few generations a.heW
type is created. Not alone by cross- .â .
ing, but by this educative process does .
he effect such great changes in. plant .
life. v.' "*v : 'i" : "'

ferent families of plants. â¢ Some â¢ are ..

rule flowers and fruits are very grate*- â¢ .
ful and lend themselves easily to the -.
educative process.
Mr. Burbank. like the .great savants .
and masters whom he has. .followed and â¢'â¢
surpassed, is himself a true child of
nature. His work lies not alone along .
dusty bookshelves, but out under the
blue sky- And with ears constantly at
tuned to nature's teachings he has
caught some of her sunshine and sim
plicity. â¢ . â¢ â -:..â¢
Despite the large sums of money
which Mr. Burbank has received for -
various fruits and flowers, his bank ac- 'â¢
count Is not a long one. For to pursue
his research requires unlimited means. -
And often the originator receives but
a fraction of the gold that accrues to
the distributor.
But Luther Burbank Is satisfied. For
wherever there are orchards and con
servatories, from California to Cairo,,
there is found a living testimony to. the ,
good he has wrought for humanity.

for he jumped from me at Tom, who

for a chance for a "safe shot in the

Pat Whalen and Joe stood near by,
waiting to send, a bullet where lt would
do the most good. They dared not
shoot while we three were fighting so
close together. The dogs were close
by, biting and snarling at the Hon, but
he didn't mind them any more than if
they'd been guinea pigs. The impact of
the lion's body bowled Tom over; he fell
on his side and face, and the claws
fortunately only ripped up a little flesh.
Before the beast could get In his deadly

the cantankerous old snarling cuss
saw he had the worse end of the flght,
for suddenly he swung around, knock

for the undergrowth above us on the
hillside. Dogs and men took after him
pell mell. Bullets did not seem to
have any effect on him; besides, the
dogs began to regain their courage
when they saw the brute on the run,
and they hugged his heels closely.
"He hadn't covered half the distance

they caught sight of the others. * That
for him to work or strive in the busy
world; lt seemed impossible for him to
add luster to the already famous name
of Choate.
There is, therefore, sense as well as
wit in Mr. Choate's remark: "I have
succeeded in spite of advantages."
Choate wasted none of his early op
portunities. He was born in the old
town of Salem, Mass. His family was
respected and well-to-do, and his early
education was carefully â¢ looked after.
He was graduated from Harvard in
1852, at the age of 20, and two years
later completed the course of the Har
vard Law School. When Mr. Choate
was asked how he came to adopt the
profession of law, he replied:
Why Choate Became a Lawyer.
"Well, it was this way: In those days
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1899.
gave us a free shot at him, and he was
quickly laid out.
"That seemed to settle the flght, for
the two live lions disappeared into the
brush before we could get a crack at
them.
"The big one, that came near mak
ing an end of both Tom and me, was
one of the largest lions ever Been in
this section. He measured nine feet
from tip to tip, and weighed 240
pounds. The others were of ordinary
size, but plenty large enough to make
short work of an Angora goat. There is
one satisfactionâ that bunch of lions
will never trouble my goats again.
"Tom and I felt somewhat bruised
a man who went to college had his
choice of three courses â law, medicine
and theology. My friends assured me
that I wasn't cut out for a minister;
in medicine our family was already rep
resented, so I accepted the only alter
native." ...
In reality, however, Choate was In
love with the law. He believes thor
oughly and enthusiastically in his pro
fession, and he has taken occasion to
pay eloquent tribute to it ln an address
before the American Bar Association.
He said:
"We love the law because, among all
the learned professions, it is the only
one that Involves the study and the
pursuit of a careful and exact science.
"Theology was once considered an
Immutable science, but how it has
changed from age to age!

ever had.
"The strangest thing about the
whole flght is the fact that the big
lion made such a stubborn flght with
a bullet through his heart. . Examina
tion showed that the bullet Pat Whalen
fired flrst went right through Its heart,
and yet it fought . with fury and
strength for at least ten minutes. And

from us after all."

condemned, and . all the past is ad
judged to be empirical. , .',-. 'â .--.--.'
"Meanwhile, common law makes void
the past where the fault is and pre
serves the rest, as it has been doing
for centuries. * â¢ â¢
"So long as the Supreme Court ex
ists to be attacked and defended; so
long as the public credit and good
faith of this great nation are in peril;
so long as the right of property, which
lies at the root of all civil government,
is scouted and the three inalienable
rights to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness, which the Declaration of
Independence proclaimed, and the con
stitution has guaranteed, are in jeop
ardy, so long will great public service
be demanded of the bar."
Choosing a Place to Practice.
Equipped with his love of the law
and his thorough preparation In It,
Choate began, in 1854, to look about
for an opening. He took plenty of
time for the task, as might be expect
ed of a scholarly man able to command
leisure. He took a trip through the
West, and It was not until 1856 that
he settled to practice in New York.
It might have seemed the natural
thing for young Mr. Choate to hang out
his shingle in Massachusetts instead
of emigrating to New York. Although
Mr. Choate does not say so, it is prob
able that the | presence of his famous
kinsman, Rufus Choate, then in the
zenith |of his power and fame, at the
head of the Massachusetts bar, had
something to do with it. Young Jo
seph had ambitions . of his own, and
he may have reasoned correctly that
they would stand better chance of ful
fillment away from the direct compar
ison with Rufus Choate's abilities. Mr.
Choate has been able to succeed in
spite not only of advantages in wealth
and education, but in spite of a distin
guished relative as well.
The famous relative was something
of a handicap at first. Lawyers and
others in New York said: _\_
"Rufus Choate's young cousin has
come down here to practice. "Let's go
and see how he compares with the old
man."
They flocked to "Joe" Choate's first
cases and most of them were dis
appointed. His quiet manner, conver
sational arguments and offhand jokes
were so entirely in contrast with the
stirring eloquence of Rufus Choate that
the observers did not appreciate its
power at first.
"Guess he hasn't much to bank on
but the family name," they said.
But there were some who appreci
ated the young attorney's possibilities,
and one of these "was William M.
Evarts. In 1559 he Invited Mr. Choate
to Join his firm. He did so, and for the
past twenty years has been the prac
tical head of the firm, though the style
of it is still Evarts, Choate & Beaman.
His Way With a Jury.
It was noticeable from the flrst that
young Choate won his cases. His way
'of talking to the jury, as he would to
an acquaintance he had stopped on the
street, his genial manner and his habit
of illustrating his telling points with
humorous or sarcastic allusions relieved
the ordinary tedium of a trial, and car
ried weight with the jurors.
From the first Choate has been a
great jury lawyer. His telling way of
expressing his ideas makes them stick
in the jurors' memory. At the same
time the aptness of his comparisons
and the manner in which they go
straight to the heart of a question
makes them influential with the Judges.
hen Choate said of a wealthy and
somewhat hypocritical witness, who
had purchased a house in Brooklyn on
the further side of Greenwood Ceme
tery, "I suppose it was the only way
he could make sure of a home beyond
the grave," the remark was bound to
remain with his hearers.
In the Pacific Railway case Collls P.
Huntington set up the claim that he
was not responsible for the acts of his
agents on the Pacific Coast. But when
Mr. Choate alluded to the chief of these
agents as "this Mark Hopkins, by
whom he was represented absolutely,
completely and without any limitation
whatever, so that you might say that
when Mr. Huntington took snuff on th*
Atlantic coast, Mr. Hopkins sneezed on
the Pacific," it was impossible to es
cape from his Interpretation.
His wit and fun making powers
brought Choate into early prominence
among the members of his own pro
fession. Jurors, Judges and listeners
welcomed his appearance in court as
certain to relieve the ordinary tedium
of a trial. But he was not all fun. He
could be terrible and scathing when he
chose, and the sharp sarcasm which
made the Laldlaw-Sage suit celebrated
was employed to the confusion and em
barrassment of -witnesses in many an
earlier and less famous case. No more
cutting remark was ever made in a
courtroom than Choate's utterance In
the suit of Architect Hunt against Mrs.
Paran Stevens. In summing up he
sketched Mrs. Stevens' rise to social
prominence in eloquent terms, con
cluding:
"And at last the arm of royalty was
bent to receive her gloved hand, and
how. gentlemen Of the jury, did she
reach this imposing eminence? (An im
pressive pause.) Upon a mountain of
unpaid bills."
Why Choate Succeeded.
When I asked Mr. Choate to what he
attributed his success as a lawyer, he
said:
"To studying the books and fighting
in the courts, principally to fighting in
the courts."
The remark calls attention to another
of Mr. Choate's characteristics. He is
a broad gauge man. He does not win
cases on fine technicalities, but by ap
pealing to the broad, basic principles
of the law. He presented, this view in
the celebrated case of the Mylod elec
tion certificate, which involved the con
trol of the New York Senate, when he
said: *
"These questions of disputed elec
tions were not to be settled by tech
nicalities or by appeals to technicali
ties. â¢ â¢ â¢ They were to be decided
...-â .: - .!â¢â¢- -â¢-,-- ----- - -. â 
on their substantial features." He has
acted on a principle in every Important
case in which he* has appeared and
the list includes almost every trial of
national interest that has come up since
1870.
How to Handle a Case
â  Mr. Choate threw an Interesting light
on one cause of his success as a lawyer
when he said: t,y
'"I : have made it my rule never to
neglect a case, .no matter how unim
portant it may seem. A doctor owes'
it to the dignity of his profession to
treat a cut finger successfully, just as
he would a fractured skull. The same
thing is true of the lawyer, although,
unfortunately, not all attorneys appre
ciate the fact." It is due to this de-"
votion to the interests of even the hum
blest clients that Mr. Choate has won
probably a greater percentage of the
cases he has appeared in than any other
lawyer in the country.
In spite of his love of fun and his
free and easy manner, Mr. Choate is a
stickler for the dignity of his profes-
sion, and he has the courage to defend
its rights, no matter by whom they are ;
ignored..
Rebuking a Judge. â¢
On one occasion, when. Choate was
addressing a bench on which Judge Van
Brunt was sitting, the latter turned his
chair around and began talking to one
of his associates. This habit, which
other Judges have been known to In
dulge in, is annoying to lawyers, but
they think it the part of wisdom not'
to notice it. Choate, however, instant- -
ly paused in his address and stood gaz
ing at the bench, with his arms folded.
When Judge Van Brunt, surprised by.
the hush in the courtroom, looked â¢
around, Mr. Choate said:
"Your Honor. I have just forty min
utes in which to make my argument.
I shall need every second of the time,
and also the undivided attention of the
court." "And you shall have It," re- â 
plied the Judge, instantly acknowledge"
Ing the justice of the appeal, .y.y
These Incidents give a fairly accu
rate view of the qualifications with '
which Choate started out on his career
as a lawyerâ a profound belief in his-,
profession, a reliance on broad princi
ples rather, than fine -technicalities, a
keen Judgment, ready wit and genial
manner. To these must be added un
limited ambition and a studious na
ture. These advantages soon out
* weighed the objections of a wealthy
family, a distinguished cousin and a
partner famous as a lawyer and public
man. â¢
There was no nonsense about Choate.
He wanted to be a successful lawyer,
and he was never led away from that
aim. He said to one of his youthful
friends:
"I would rather be the leader of the
New York Bar than the President of
the United States."
Too Busy . or Society.
He kept his Ideal before him. When '.
it was suggested that he should 'enter
politics, he said "No." hen oppor- '
tunities to go into society presented
themselves, he answered, "I am too
busy." He studied harderâ not only law
books, but the masters of English writ
ing and speech. â¢
Studying the books and fighting in â¢
the courts soon began to tell for
choate. By IS7O they had made him
one of the foremost lawyers of the '
country. Since then every year has
made his position as leader of the bar
more unquestioned.
Yet Choate is not a well-known man
in the sense that Depew or a dozen
others'. who have been no more con
stantly before the public are. To the .
citizens of the country at large his :
name signifies a man who makes occa
sional brilliant speeches and who re
ceives large fees for his services to
wealthy clients. This is a singularly .
erroneous view.
During the recent campaign in New
York, Richard Croker made the charge
against Choate that he had never taken .
up the case of a poor man. Choate re- .
torted that on one occasion he had ap
peared for a man who, by his own
sworn testitmony, was poor. â  He al
luded to his appearing for Croker him
self, after that gentleman had declared
before an investigating committee that
he was poor. This may be hardly a
convincing instance, and was inspired,
doubtless, by a desire to get the better
of Mr. Croker. But it is a fact that
Mr. Choate's charges are very moder
ate, considering his eminence in the
legal profession. . -

Madame Ezeta arched her heavy

madame's English failed her, and she
filled. in. the blank with a characteristio
: glance, from her brilliant black eyes.
The Ezeta home in Oakland is a very
modest one, filled to overflowing with
little ' Ezetas, 'one an olive-skinned,
brown-eyed duplicate of the other. On
the walls are pictures and photographs
of celebrities with autograph inscrip
tions.. '..'..'
â¢:' A. pair of gorgeous curtains, pure
gold embroidered on a field of white
. satin, hang in soft shining folds, their
magnificence out of all harmony with
their setting. Madame Ezeta, in a
gown of some cotton material rather
the worse for wear, stood for a moment
in the shadow of their cold magnifi
cence, all unconscious of the contrast
to her modest gown. .
"You see those," she said, pointing to
the pictures with a slim dark finger.
''Well, what I care for all thatânoth
ing!" and madame snapped her fing
ers In disdain.
-.-'â  "Those" on examination proved to
. be very, poor pictures of a very pictur
esque, low, rambling mansion.
â¢ "The Presidential palace in San Sal
vador," explained Madame Ezeta.
On the opposite wall were view* of
: plantations, palm trees and luxuriant
Undergrowth suggesting the tropics.
y "Those are ' 'fincas'â what you call
plantations. Once my husband own
many, manyâ now all gone. But I no

one. nurse for the bebltos. You give me
; all those fincas. you let me live In the
Presidential . palaceâ l take it, you
.think?. No!. I say- muchas gracias,
dispense me."
: Here Madame Ezeta laughed and
stopped long enough to rescue one of
â¢ her young hopefuls who was balancing
himself like any little "gringo" on the
' edge of the .window sill. * ,
Madame Ezeta talks fast and furious
ly, but whether you have a nodding
acquaintance with the Spanish lan
guage you can understand her. The
language of the eye, the play of feat
ure and the intonation of the voice be
tray the key to the Hispanlo-Amerl
.. canus riddle.
"I tell you why I say it is better to
have quiet and happiness than to be
the President's wife. You see those
.gray hairs," and madame pointed to a
silve rthread or. two among her raven
â¢locks,: "well, I get one for each year

Odd Life of the Immortal "J. N."
OUT in Illinois, the "Immortal J N."
'lies close to death's door. He
â¢ thought to live forever, for in his
disordered fancy he was the cen- '
ter of the universe. At his will
. the planets moved about a com
mon center, and that center was the brow
â¢ : of the "Immortal J. N." He had said
many a time, when vexed by the gibes of
. those who made his long hair and his
â  .trailing gray duster the butts of their wit,
that he would "release the pressure" and
send all creation to original atoms. It
-was the "Immortal J. N.," albeit, who
year after year "assumed the pressure"
â¢â¢ and thereby "lifted the veil." In other
â¢ .words", he controlled the universe and
aimed to free humanity.
It all sounds like the whims of a crazy
â¢ man, say you. Well, the "Immortal J.
. . N." always said his mind was affected.
Yet he was clever enough to live on noth
ing for nearly forty years and to 'ravel
- over the country and live at good hotels
without ever buying a railroad ticket or
paying a hotel bill.
â  "It's against my principle to pay inter
est and against my interest to pay prin
cipal," remarked the "Immortal J. N.."
on more than one occasion, and his phil
osophy of life was a profitable one.
Managers of "opera houses" and the
aters all through the middle Wert gave
the- "Immortal J. N." the use of their
. buildings free of charge with lights and
attendance. Hundreds have listened to
his weird talk of "assuming the pressure,"
. whereby, he "lifted tbe veil," and gave
'- .the Immortal of their wealth. Not that
"J. N." ever needed any money, for he
never paid for anything.
Â ' One of the recollections of my boyhood
*. brings back- the figure of the "Immortal

Â°" in a little Ohio village and glaring indig-
n antly at the proprietor, who had present
ed & bill. He shook his head until the
â¢'long Iron gray hair undulated like a
mane. His hands were -in the pockets of
his duster.
"Sir, you presume," he thundered. "I
am the â¢ 'lmmortal J. N. It Is such as

devoted columns to the accounts of the
"Immortal J. N." and his vagaries. He
religiously kept every clipping, and. the
pockets of his duster were well filled witn
clippings.
"J. N.s" real name was Jacob Newman
Free. He was born in Chambersburg,
Pa., on May 28, 1828. His father, the Rev.
Dr. John Free, was a minister of pro
found attainments. The Free family
moved from Pennsylvania to Mansfield,
0., in 1831, and subsequently went to Mc-
Cutchenvllle, In the same State.
In early life the "Immortal J. N." was
known for his brilliancy and learning. He
was admitted to the bar. He went West
on the wave of the California gold ex
citement, and several years afterward re
turned shattered in intellect.
His story, always told in his compara
tively lucid intervals, and generally cred
ited, was that he had defended a man
accused of murder with such success that
he was acquitted. Circumstantial evi
dence was against the prisoner. The tes
timony indicated cold-blooded crime. Ja
cob N. Free believed that his client was
innocent. He fought over every shred of
evidence, he cross-examined brilliantly
and incisively, and then at the last made
an appeal to the jury which swept the
twelve good men and true away from the
realm of reason and cqld facts. The pris
oner was acquitted. Scores crowded
around Free to congratulate him. That
night, after the trial, .ne man who had
been acquitted came to Free, thanked him
for his admirable defense and confessed
that he had committed the crime.'-
Jacob N. Free fell from his chair. He
/ was found hours afterward. The hair was
whitened about his temples. The man
whom he had saved from . execution ! has
never been found. Jacob N. Free became
the "Immortal J. N.," a wanderer upon
the face of the earth, the expositor of a
weird philosophy which he never half un
derstood.
He first attracted extended public; no

ever since to meet again. Through her dainty phrases there trembled
a sense akin to those whisperings distinguishable in breaking waves and
rustling. treetops, which men like Almodoro note and understand. '; And
hence it was that the day before the persuasive rapture of her music
had .unfolded: to the magician some witchery of an incomparable meaning,
through which he had detected, the musician's. secret.
Of a sudden, as though some Intuitive sense made her conscious of an
undiscovered presence, she turned and faced Antonio. She knew him not,
never having seen him before, but rising composedly, confronted him with
a keen glance. He began speaking abruptly, as men impatient of the cir
cumlocution of the feminine mind are apt to do. addressing her rather, as
some bird of 111-omen which haunts people's wedding night on equivocal
adventures. ; He told me that, as might have been expected, she answered
pretty tartly, but that when they had made an end of angry words he ap
pealed to her to remove her presence from Bassanio's life, insisting upon
the blemish it must otherwise cast and the danger that would. ensue to
herself. So. as she seemed not to comprehend this last allusion, he de
scribed the plight of Jessica and Gratiano, which could have been Intend
ed for.no other but herself. Then perceived he the red oleander bush be
hind her move as though some one lurked unseen behind Its cover. y- But
Pipistrello - answered:
"It is the lot -of many, and Bassanio and I are of them, to be duped,
and misled and feel their hearts 1 poisoned with an anguish they, dare not
whisper. Diana yonder, could she turn toward us the wistful pathos of
her scarred visage, would tell you that the gods divert themselves with
the wrlthlnsrs of our little despair."
Then Antonio pursued his argument exceeding earnestly, albeit, despite
himself,- something disarmed, as many a man might be, *by the light* ln
her eyes and the flush that mantled, her handsome face and. the -Intense
feeling that thrilled in her voice, till she added very softly;
. "Can I forget, or he cease to remember, what we have been and what
1 we are to one another? If either were forever gone, could the other bury
out of sight the sweetness of the love that has united us against you all?
Not long ago I almost ceased to think upon the future that seemed; a
place of danger and unrest, but now I hasten to it as to some fair garden
whose fragrant ' paths I know, and Its bower where , together we shall
pluck oblivion of this hateful place, and ' where perhaps the 1 fabled buds
and blossoms that were the promise of Diana in her woodland youth shall
whiten again." - - * "; â '"â¢-' -â¢:'â -;â¢â .
At which words "Antonio heard a slight movement behind, the ; oleander,
like the start or spasm of one stung to the quick. So, being not a little
foiled, he bowed as one. who salutes the enemy and walked away out of \
sight. Nevertheless he smiled at theglibness of a Veneian girl talking
, thus of gardens and woodlands and fragrant paths. We of Venice are used

Then remembering what Basssanio had said, that at sunset, now not
an hour distant, he would join his flrst love and forever. leave Belmonte,
he murmured aloud, "And then, with the passionate blood of. her ances

As If In answer to this ominous query came faintly from the ; spot he
had quitted a wild cry of anguish and affright. Antonio hastened back

name, was Reyna Barrios. "? fY'fyy--
In San Francisco she is one of many.
The house she has rented on Pierce
street ; ls large and comfortable, but
it is not a palace. Summer villa has
she none. Mrs. Barrios is accorded all
the courtesy due a lady, but she re- ;
ceives no more homage or adulation
than her neighbor.
"Would you not like to have It all
back again? "Would you not like to
live it over?"
"I could not live it' over if I would,"
answers Madame Barrios. "The strain
a second time would prove too much
for me. To . live in Guatemala as a
.President's wife Is to suffer daily, al
most hourly, martyrdom. That is, for
an American girl."
So Mme. Ezeta's â  theory . that an
American girl would take more kindly
to the Presidential : honor is thus re
futed by an American girl who has
had the actual experience. .
For Mme. Barrios was not to Guate-.
mala born. She met Reyna Barrios in
New Orleans,' her native city. General
Barrios he was then, having earned
the shoulder straps under his uncle,
President Ruflno Barrios. . When Presi
dent Barrios was killed on the plains
of Salvador, and Barillas gained the
Presidency, General Reyna Barrios was
exiled from Guatemala.
, It was during his exile that he met
and fell in love with this little New
Orleans girl. She did not understand
his language, but she could chatter
French, and when he left for New York
she had ' promised to marry him. He
told her that ; his prospects were very
poor, but she shrugged her shoulders
gayly over that. ' Reyna Barrios was
what his countrymen call "muy sym
patlca," and because he was sympatica,
and * because his bravado and : noncha
lance appealed to her, she went to New
York and married him. ;
' Reyna Barrios ' brought his .bride to
Ban Francisco. They lived quietly in
'- very modest apartments. General Bar
rios never allowed a movement in the
game political of Guatemala I to escape
his watchful eye. "The Barrioses.were
born to rule," and he . meant to fulfill
his destiny. One day he packed hur
riedly, and General and Mrs. Barrios
were noted the next day as among
those who had sailed for San Salva
' dor. â¢ â  ' : f. : yf'
"I had no idea of the country I was
going to," said Mme. Barrios. "I imag
ined it was a sort of Garden of Eden
and that I would see birds of paradise,
I was very rudely disenchanted the mo
ment I reached San Salvador. It was
a ' most cruel disappointment. Every
thing looked so mean and squalid. I
could not understand the language, and
the customs of the people seemed most
barbarous to me. *
"My husband kept . assuring . me that

And amid many speculations as to what may have happened, all or
which till Diana speaks are likely to remain Idle. gossip, there comes to
me the repetition of a thought that will not be silenced, how deeply, per
chance, Almodoro's stealthy whisper to Portiaâ thrust at the heartâ may
have < ... -.--â . ... -
The manuscript breaks off as abruptly as lt began, nor has an ex
haustive search among the catalogues to the millions of musty documents
at the-Biblioteca San Marco and the Archivio di Venezia been rewarded
by the slightest clew to the ultimate fate of Portia and Bassanio. If those
vast collections are ever thoroughly examined some further particulars of
them may be recovered; but now they disappear into the oblivion from
which this narrative summoned- them, and the identity of Portia's rival .
is left to conecture. â â 'â â...
My study of the manuscript filled me with a desire to visit the site of
Portia's villa. Of the house no vestige remains, and the dimensions of the
park have been largely reduced. But its name. Villa Belmonte, survives,
and Its position in the outskirts of Padua is easily ascertained. I went to
It on foot, conducted by two brown-faced urchins who pointed out the
modern dwelling which occupies the place of the ancient edifice and stands
in the midst of half a dozen pink and yellow stucco casinos, such as ex
emplify the taste of modern Italy. A suave mannered and philosophic
minded custods laid aside his tobacco pipe and pruning knife to accompany
me through the historic Ilex groves, answering my questions good natured
ly,-and;giving me leave to wander to the terrace, where I found the long
walks between clipped hedges flanked by weather stained granite benches
and the ancient balustrade which marks the spot where the narrative
.reached, its climaxâ where Antonio" talked with the being whose misfor
tunes had borne such bitter fruit, where her despairing outcry was fol
lowed by so sinister. a token of the Venetian Cinque-cento. Here I beheld
that faint, flne line of shining peaksâ in aspect so masterful, so self-con
tained, so far removed from the dust and dross of earthâ whose contem
plation to the Doges of heroic centuries must have held no ordinary sig
nificance. Before me spread the Italian pianura, Its olive and emerald ;
seamed with yellow beneath the midday heat. Almost motionless above
the spire of the Paduan Cathedral rose a copper vane, in semblance of
the. argosy of bygone., times whose antique image, glistening above the
cypresses, reflects the prosaic sunshine of to-day. The statue of the
Grecian Diana has disappeared, but the dim vistas remain beautiful as
of old in their repose; and In Diana's place broods the haunting memory
of the Doge's narrative amid the fleeting shapes . one's fancy conjures.

study of human nature, a lifetime spent in that atmosphere of mysticism,
of intrigue of refinement, of graceful companionship, and of the audacity
and subterfuge of Venetian statecraft, are characteristics which the man's
surroundings wrote year by year upon his features -

could save him, the order came from
Guatemala giving him the right to re

ately for Guatemala.

"In Guatemala the will of the Presi
dent is absolute. If he desires a man
put out of his way he orders him shot.
The people of Guatemala do not say a
man has been elected President. They
say he has come into power!
"General Barrios was given the cell
set aside for prisoners of state. I was
allowed to send him his meals and to â¢
see him for a few moments each day,
so I was sure that he could prove his
innocence when tried and that all would
be well.
"But one morning some friends in
formed me that all the other prisoners
save General Barrios had been shot,
and that his turn had come.
" "When were they tried?' I asked.
" 'Tried! Not at all. It was the Pres
ident's order.'
"I was nearly distracted, and my
worst fears were confirmed when, early
in the evening, I received a note from
General Barrios, asking me to come â¢
and say farewell. He was to be shot
at midnight.
"I went to the prison and told Gen- .
eral Barrios that I meant to go to Pres
ident Barillas and plead for his life. â 
He commanded me not to do so, but
without waiting to listen to his argu
ments I ran through the streets until
I reached the home of Mr. Mizner, the
American Consul. j
."Together we hurried to the house
of President Barillas. I implored him
on my knees, and the President, bid- .
ding me rise, informed me that Gen
eral Barrios was a free man. An hour â¢
later the prison gates shut behind him. .
"In that moment I realized what it
meant to be President of Guatemala. -
On his aye or nay had depended my
husband's life.
"But I did not yet know what it *
means to be the wife of a President.
That came later. Before my husband
gained the Presidency there was the n
usual revolution and all the horrors at.,
tending it. I had long since learned .
that in those countries the life of- a
man is valued i-s little as that of a
worthless cat. But whatever other Im
perfections my husband had, during his
term of power he certainly never wan
tonly took life.
"We entertained elaborately and fre
quently. The decorations and details
of these affairs were always a pleasure
to me. The beautiful tropical plants .
and flowers lend themselves so grace
fully to decoration, and the pine needles
with which the floors of the courts and
corridors are strewn have the most deli
cate, subtle fragrance. y
"But, no matter what you do or how
hard you try to please, it is almost lmÂ»
possible to kindle real friendship or
gratitude in a native Guatemalan. Of
course there are exceptions, but such
is the rule. A stab in the dark is the
reward for kindness and protection.
"In the last revolution, the one Just
before the assassination of my husband,
who do you suppose led the rebels?
His own brother and brother-in-law! -
The 'war of the family,' the Guatema- .
lans call it. It cost President Barrios
an immense Bum of money, for he was
entirely unprepared for it. How could
a man suspect that his own family,
whom he had raised Into power with
him, would strike a blow. But that
can be taken as the keynote of that
country. Friendship .is rooted In the â¢
shifting quicksands of treachery.
"Aside from the revolutions and in- â 
trigues which make the life of a Presi
dent's wife intolerable, it is Impossible
for an American woman to find the- ;
people 'sympatlca.' Their manners,
customs and morals are of such a low
standard. Ido not mean that among
'the best families there are not some
very charming people. But they are
decidedly the exceptions.
"Among the foreigners at the lega
tions there are alwrys some delightful
peonle. An American woman living in
the city of Guatemala can have a .
charming coterie of friends. â¢ But the
wife of the President must know and
entertain many for political or other
reasons. And the heartless Ingratitude"'
which meets material benefits and fa
vors is a constant -Â«*- ce of wonder
ment to one accustomed to the milk of
human kindness.
"To understand it one must live
through it. It is '-ideed not worth
while to be the wife of a Guatemalan'
President. I woul prefer a thousand,
times that my husband had remained,
simply General Barrios. My life would
have been a far happier one.
"And, above all, it is not worth while
for an American girl to be the wife of -
a Central American President. She is '

"Our usual method of work, which
we followed in every instance, was ito

SOME OF THE STRANGE FISH CAUGHT IN MEXICO BY PROFESSOR JORDAN FOR STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
"We caught a new kind of catfish
that I think will prove valuable to pro
pagate here for a food fish. It is of
good size and its shape indicates plenty
of- fine flesh. It is more lively than
our catfish and should be a valuable
addition to the food fish of State.
"But, really, I do not yet know just
what we have got in our collection.
We caught several fish that we were
not familiar with; put them Into bot
tles and have not yet come across them
again., It may be that some will turn
out to be of a new species. But Ido
know that our expedition has been a
successful one and will be of the great
est benefit to the university."

, Just what science will gain as a re
sult of the recent collecting tour made
through Mexico- by Dr. Jordan and
Instructor J. O. Snyder of the zoology
department, has not yet been fully as
certained. At the present stage in the
study of the big collection of fishes,
stored away, for preservation in jars
and barrels of all descriptions, the de
partment is able to announce with more
or less accuracy the discovery of eight
species hitherto unknown to science.
Before the species can* be classified,
several months must be spent in care
ful- Investigation;- In the meantime
other new fish may-be: found, ln the 1000
specimens obtained from Mexican wat
ers. Besides tlfe ' valuable additions
made to scientific knowledge, the new.
specimens are of particular worth to
the Stanford museum of fishes, as they
practically complete a collection of
fishes taken along the Western coast
from Alaska to the extremity of .South
America. Furthermore, the recent trip
is another great step In the field of
systematic . zoology. As soon as the
geographical distribution" of fishes is
accurately determined, . then scientists
can intelligently ask themselves the
question, How and when did these
fish get where they are found?
Mexico is a veritable . paradise for
the Ichthyologist, as its rivers contain
the fauna of South and North Ameri
can varieties. It is the meeting place
for ' species of the frigid ana torrid
zones. The zoologist can leave the
snow-capped mountains and in a day's
travel find himself In " valleys where
southern varieties of life exist. Entic
ing as. this field is to the naturalist, it
has been studied by no means care
fully. On their recent trip, for example,
important rivers of Mexico, never be
fore visited by any icythyologist. were
fished -with flattering results. In fact,
a number of the rarest specimens were
caught in the parts of Mexico new to
the collector.
Before beginning their work Dr. Jor
dan and Mr. Snyder carefully surveyed
â  the ground. > The first place fished at
was Guadalajara, which was reached
on the 22d of December. At this place
they were told that the fish could be
more easily caught in Lake de Chapala.
where they cast their nets. .
In dealing with the fishermen con
siderable diplomacy had to be used.
Inquiries, concerning the fish would at
once arouse, their suspicions. Thinking
the naturalists were considering enter
ing competition with them for the sup
ply of the fish markets, they would in
variably try to deceive them. To find
out exactly where the fish came from
Mr. Snyder found it necessary to watch
the men as they came in before day
light with their catch.
At the City of Mexico, San Francisco
fish were found in competition with the
product of the Mexican waters. The
California varieties had been expressed
on Ice, yet sold for the same price as
the native fish. The waters swarmed
with fish, but the Mexican fishermen
were not enterprising 'or " energetic
enough to force the California fish out
of the market. ' â¢â¢-.â¦.. .., â¢ â¢
fti Near the City of Mexico a great many
salamanders were collected. These
lizard -like reptiles are eaten by the
natives. Their use as food is said to
date back to the time when Cortez was
reduced to the extremity of feeding his
immense army on them.
After fishing Lake Thalco, the beau
tiful Ixtla River, near the ancient
town, Puente de Ixtla, was carefully
seined for specimens, as it was one of
the streams that had. never before been
visited by a naturalist. Their efforts
were rewarded in finding the first of
the new species. A queer catfish, not
only specifically but generically new,
was caught. Their efforts were fur
ther rewarded by discovering a small
red bellied minnow, remarkable because
of its new species, and the fact that
it was taken at a point farther south
than any minnow has been known to
go. ; b-':' .-yyy-"
At this place the' natives had never
seen such a thing as a draw net and
had to be instructed in its use. Much
of the manual labor had to be per
formed by the naturalists. It is safe
to say that the next time Mexico is
visited by Stanford icthyologlsts, Amer
: ican boys familiar with the use of draw
nets will make y up a part of the expe
dition. ..â .:â 
Another. species unknown to science
was taken near Aquas Callente, where
the naturalists went after collecting a
number of reptiles at Cuernavaca.
As one great object of the trip was
â¢ to examine the fishes , of the eastern
coast, which have been studied in any
thing but a systematic way, Dr. Jordan
and Mr. Snyder lost no time in getting
to Tampico, which was reached on the
10th of January. .By fishing the mouth
of the Rio Paunco River and the la
goons near by two of the new species
were obtained. One is of the sunfish
variety, and ' the other resembles a
sucker. ... -yY'yy
After a trip down the coast to Vera
Cruz, where fever was found to be rag
ing, Dr. Jordan started for home with
his party of sightseers, consisting of
Mrs. Jordan. Professor Dudley, 'J. E.
McDowell, T. A. Storey. G. M. Bow
man, Miss Bowman, of the university;
Mrs. S. F. Lieb and daughter Elna of
San Jose, Mr. and Mrs. Butler of San
Mateo. W. T. Reid, head master of Bel
mont School, and E. C. Ely of St. Mat
thews" School. " Mr. Snyder remained
: in Mexico for a couple of weeks' addi
tional collecting.
23 It was near-Rascon; below the beau
tiful fills of the Rio Verde River, that
the peculiar long tailed fish was seined.
The funds necessary to carry out this
valuable work were furnished by Mr.
Timothy Hopkins of Menlo Park, who
has been the life of the zoology depart
ment since the foundation of the uni
versity. With his aid, Dr. Jordan has
been able to make Stanford the lead
ing university of the country In the Im
portant work of classifying the fish of
America. Scores of young ichthyolog
ists have been equipped with syste
matic methods for the study of fishes.
Many of the graduates of the zoology
department have Government positions

When Does the Twentieth Century Begin? .
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â When
does the twentieth century
begin?
It is all very well to an
swer confidently "at the be
ginning of the year 1900" and consider
the matter settled. It isn't settled by a
long way, and the new century doesn't
begin at the, beginning, but at the end
of the coming year, according to learned
men who are : sticklers for accuracy.
As the end of the century approaches
the question is likely to assume greater
proportions and the controversy to wax
hotter. â 
The best thing to do, therefore, is to
quote the opinion of one of those wise
philosophers whose lives are occupied
in keeping tabs on the time and tide
that , proverbially wait for no man.
Here is the opinion of a prominent as
tronomer verbatim
The next century will begin on Janu
ary 1, 1901â the last year of the present
century being 1900. The present era
begins with the year A. D. 1, and the
year before being B. C. 1, there being
no year 0. This is inconvenient for
chronology, but it is the accepted mode
of reckoning. i vvb
If historians had been content to
start the era with the year /'naught,"
as astronomers start the hour' of the
day : with the cipher 0, all would have
been well and we should not have to
face the Inevitable paradox of talking
about the closing year of the nineteenth
century when we shall be already dat
ing our letters 1900. Scientists and
those who have to mark the lapse of
seconds, say in regulating the prolonged
exposure of a photographic plate or the
printing of a bromide paper, accustom
themselves to count "naught, one, two,"
and so on; but the : popular : method of
counting is to begin straightaway "one.
two, three," .by which the first ; second
is apt to be much curtailed.
A similar error took place in ' begin
ning the Christian era, the year 0 hav
ing been : dropped . for the 'â  convenience
of chronologlsts. The present year has,
â  morally, no more i right to be called 1899
before December 31 next than an infant
of one month has to be called a year
old before it has completed its twelfth
month. :' Accurately speaking the Chris
tian era is in its 1899 th year, which ob
viously :is not the ; same thing ! as the
completed % 1899 years Yof the era and
cannot ' be - confounded . with : the 1900 th. -
Another way of demonstrating the
truth â¢of the ' statement that the new
century begins at the end of the year
able gray-haired scientist, a man of vast
learning and world-wide. experience, who
had roamed- all his life In foreign lands in
search of his beloved specimens. I had
in my mind's eye Kipling's famous Ger
man orchid' collector, a man full of racy
anecdote and weird recollection, who could
tell, in strange guttural- dialect, such hair
raising stories as "Bertram and Bibi," or
"The German Flag."
Unfortunately, Kipling's type of natur
alist Is not to be met with nowadays, at
least not on board the Stella Erland. In
stead of my venerable scientist, I found
a young, roughly dressed man, seated on
the heel of the main topmast, which had
been sent down on deck for repairs. u -.- >
"Mind the oil," he said, as I stepped
over the low bulwark, and I saw the spar
had been freshly coated and was still
sticky. "Yes, I am Professor Anthony;
come below." - â 
It Is but a step from the main deck to
the stern of the little craft, and then
we dived through the companionway into
a tiny, dingy, ..untidy cabin. There Is
nothing romantic about the Stella Erland.
Professor Anthony's devotion to science
leaves him neither time nor means to
waste upon useless ornamentation. The
schooner is a strong, handy little craft,
well fitted for her task, but she is not
exactly pretty. For four years, ever since
she was built near Seattle, she has W?en
trading up on Cook Inlet, rough and
dangerous voyaging, calling for light rig
and strong canvas.
The professor is young, only 33, and
delicate looking, with the light of enthu
siasm in his eyes. He has only one aim
.and object in lifeâ add- to, his ornitho
logical collection. To secure a rare speci
men, a bird hitherto unknown and un
classified, he is prepared to risk any dan
ger, to brave any discomfort. And cer
tainly, looking around the cabin of tne
schooner, one wonders how eight or ten
men are going to exist here in the trop
ics. Both sides of the place are lined
with a double tier of wide bunks, making
eight sleeping places in all. In. the cen
ter there is a rude oilcloth-covered table,
two or three rickety campstools are scat
tered about, and this completes the cata
logue of furniture.
"Up ln the Arctic they used to put two
men In each of those bunks." remarked
the professor, "but I guess, where we are
going, we will find one enough. I bought
this schooner to replace the J. C. Wah'l
berg, my former vessel, which was lost
about 300 miles below San Diego. I was
not on board of her when she was
wrecked, but all the same lt was my own
fault. I lent her to another man while I
went north to attend to some business of
my own, afld of course he sailed her
ashore. I had been two years cruising
off the Mexican coast, collecting on the
Revillagigedo Islands, and had never met
with an accident before. They are most
interesting islands for a collector to visit.
I got several new species of .parrots and
doves."
The professor denies Indignantly that he
makes any money out of Tils ornltholog
1900 is to take the face of a twenty
four-hour clock. A clock of this kind
records the flight of seconds in one
circle and that of every hour of the
day and night in a third. It is,'there
fore, a twenty-four-hour clock, but you
may look in vain for the numeral 24 or
XXIV. All three concentric circles be
gin with 0. Thus the outer one, allotted
to the minutes, is marked 0, 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55. The inner one
begins with 0 and proceeds I, 11, 111
and so on to XXIII; and the innermost
circle, marking the seconds, journeys
from 0 to 10, 20 and so on to 50. It is
a little bewildering to find that 0 stands
for XII and XII is where VI is usu
ally placed, upside down, while the sec
ond hand points to 0 when that of the
ordinary timepiece records 60.
There will probably be a great deal of
argument about this, although the
question was settled a hundred years
ago beyond dispute, but it must be
agreed that the foregoing plainly and
clearly shows that the twentieth cen
tury will not begin next New :â  Year's
day, but when the year 1900 is ended. _

to those who watch the cataract
of Niagara; but the water com
panies . by whom the household
necessity supplied do not consider their
commodity jso cheap as to justify the
consumer in wasting it. In this city, as in

declare is wasted amounts to millions of
gallons a year. But how to stop the
.waste was a problem that It seemed no
one would solve. They have solved it at

Sana Davis Has Dropped tiie Fen for the Toga and Sagebrush Journalism Is in Mourning â His Recklessly Brilliant ,' Career and Some of the Pranks He Flayed
SAD-fiTED Nevada journalism- is in a sorry plight. Sam Davis
has deserted her for politics. It's the worst blow the sagebrush
.State, has suffered since the Comstock shut down and the faro
. banks gasped out their lives, .unable to cash five-cent chips.
.'â¢ln the palmy days of the Comstock Davis was associated with
.-.â¢â¢ y such men ai. Bill .Nye,- Mark Twain, Judge C. C. Goodwin and
-....; Arthur McEwen His .last venture in San Francisco journalism
was a .breezy publication, at the Midwinter Fair in connection with the
'49 Mining Camp. Since that time, he has continued to conduct the Car
pop Appeal, '.a- paper noted for strikingly original features 1 at times while
he was at its helm. This trumpet-toned organ he has edited for the past
two: decades.. At. the beginning of the present year he announced his
retirement-arid his successor as H. R. Mighels, a stepson. And so Nevada
loses the last of Its unique journalists.
". Davfs, -With- the Carson- Appeal waving above him, easily led the pro
cession and the whoops ln late Nevada journalism. He took particular
, pride in unearthing schemes of boodlers and in tricing up public officials
â â¢â¢â¢â '. whom he believed to be shirking duties
Imposed upon them by law. This far
from pleasant occupation has kept him
constantly en combat with gangs and rings
for many years, and has been the means
of causing him .an occasional visit to a
physician for the purpose of having nu
merous abrasions about the head and face
treated. These little occurrences did not
spire any fear in Davis. Invariably,
the morning following the altercation a
page of matter, containing a lashing
which few writers could administer,
would appear in the Appeal. His last
trouble arose with Charles A. Jones, the
United States District Attorney, who was
later shot by young Gulnan at Carson.
In this fracas Davis received the worst
of the battle, as Jones had a revolver.
Davis was willing even to combat this,
but his friends prevented him from run
ning against it.
Davis began his newspaper career
very early in life. He was born in
BranfoTd, Conn., in 1850, and is the son of
an Episcopalian clergyman. He was sent
to a theological school, and after three
years of delving into the intricacies of
the theological course, threw his Greek
book at a professor's head and was told
to go home.- .He edited a small newspaper published at the college and
there- got his first taste for journalism. After his expulsion he went to
Nebraska and became a reporter on the Brownville 'Democrat at $3 a
â¢week. That was his start.
Dropped the Pert for the Toga.
His Work attracted the attention of Dr. Miller, publisher of the Herald
at Omaha, and- he advanced to Sam the first opportunity to make his
presence known and felt In the world. About this time the correspondent
of the Herald at Lincoln had written such a scathing review of the
iniquities of the Legislature, which was then in session, that he was
obliged to leave town in order to escape the vengeance of some of the
members who sought his life. Miller wired to Davis to take the position
and Inside of twenty-four hours he reported for duty.
Sam took up the story of corruption where his predecessor left off and
opened a rapid-flring battery of vituperation on the members. He at length
was -informed "that If he did not retract certain reflections on a Senator
frorb Nebraska City he would be killed by noon the next day. This Sena
tor had flagrantly violated his pledges to the people - and when Davis
wired to Nebraska City the situation of affairs, a carload of indignant
citizens "came to the capital early next morning with a rope. They pro
tected the newspaper man and made their representative vote according
â¦Â« viis-nlatform pledges.
10 A week later, however, there was a new *rievance arising ; over i his
correspondence and a dozen men came to the lodging house where he was
â tonning They asked the landlord to be shown to his room, /as .they
wonted to get rid of Wm then and thera. ThÂ» men were desperate char-.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1899.
HARRIED FOR LOVE THOUGH IT MEANT POVERTY
They make no effort to sell their pencils; they make no effort to arrest the attention of the chattering throng that surges by un
heeded. Not even by a gesture do they endeavor to attract notice to themselves and their heeds. They stand silent and motionless,
gazing straight out before themâ the man with a touch of dignity in his air; the woman with her small face puckered and shriveled, her
eyes red and watery and her lips purple with the chill that seems to have reached to her bonesâ but patiently . resigned, both, to what
ever the fates may bring. So might two earth-tortured human souls stand gazing across the river Styx, hoping nothing, fearing nothing,
since whatever comes can be no worse than that which they have already known.
"Such creatures don't know what love means," he declares. "They
huddle together like sheep in a storm for the sake of company, in
their misery, that's all. As for those. two, they drink like fishes and
are all around disreputable. It really is wrong to encourage them
by giving them anything, but they look so wretched that one can't
well help it. As for loving each other '.' yffff
"I wonder If they do," 1 comes the musing voice again out of the
halo of white fur.

I am going calling, and mine is to be an unfashlonably early call,
for my prospective hosts keep eccentric hours. I can be sure of seeing
them only by timing my visit so that I may be sure to arrive before
they have arisen from their slumbers.
My destination is a long, sway-backed,- low-browed, two-story
building with a dark and untidy saloon for a corner stone, which
stretches away down one side of a dirty and discouraged-looking
acters, whose schemes of plunder Davis had exposed and he knew that
he was "up against It." j':*- ."'.*
While the landlord was parleying with the men Davis got out of a back
window, and, reaching the house of a friend, borrowed a fast horse and
rode nearly all night to a town called Beatrice. Here he found a news
paper man named Calhoun, whom he immediately engaged to return to
Lincoln on the same horse and continue his work, signing Davis' full name
to all of his letters. Calhoun was soon on his way, to the seat of war and
for the following month engaged in ripping the Legislature to pieces In
a manner that was a reminder of Brick. Pomeroy In his palmiest days.
Calhoun kept his "incog" and everybody, regarded Davis as the actual
writer. While the baffled men, whom his substitute was abusing, were out
gunning for him, he was taking life easy on a little ranch ten miles from
Beatrice, and the farmer with whom he .was stopping did not, suspect
his identity. The truth of the affair was revealed at the close of the ses
sion and this incident first placed Davis before the public. â :.. ffyy ff
After that he went, on the staff of the Lincoln Statesman. One day
he received a call from a stranger, who frankly told him that he had
been hired to administer a beating to the editor. '. Davis inquired what
price he expected to be paid for his services and was told that lt was to
be $100. : .'." yyy â ' /yiyfY ', 'yy
"In that case," was the reply, "we had better go in partnership. A

divide it. In the next Issue I will, have an Item that some unknown man
stepped into the office and whipped a printer. You can explain that you
made a mistake and let It go at. that." '
This programme was carried out to' the letter and the man "who paid

of the joke which had been played upon > .

the State, and lt was several years be- j
fore the press suffered the, matter to die
out.
St. Louis saw Davis next, working 1 as
river reporter on the Republican. Sam â¢'
Clemens formerly held the same position
and it was here that he got the name of
"Mark Twain." Davis attempted to liven
up the river column, but made It too live
ly and was discharged. He then drifted ;
to Chicago, and applied for a position on
the Times. ' .
"Any credentials?" asked the city edi

"None,", was the reply. 1

"Can't do anything . for a . man who ls

"But I was discharged inside of jr a ;

Sam was ! given a place on . the ' strength of f this and went to ' work
Shortly afterward the managing editor sent for him and he mounted the
long flight. of stairs to the guarded sanctum. '"â¢:, /*; , y- : '.-.
"Are you the man who has been manufacturing these bogus items for

Sam acknowledged he was. . :/.'. , :. .' f ..
"That's right. If you ; don't find news, make some."
He felt rather complimented, on his ability as a faker.of news and
contemplated asking for a raise of salary, but when he reached his desk
he found his discharge. His next employment was obtained on the Chicago
News with J. Sterling Morton and from there he "drifted West The first
work he ever i did in San Francisco was for the News Letter and he tells
his experience somewhat as follows:
'yy "I struck the town with $12 and I immediately wrote a poem, for the
News Letter. ; It appeared and: I went; around; for my pay. I found- a
benevolent old gentleman with , white ' hair and â¢a l clean-shaven face who

opened for me affably by a courteous person who ls returning to his
home nestâ from some place further off than the cornerstone, be it
remarkedâ with a pailful of foaming beer.
Far be it from me to criticize a fellow mortal for his taste in
beverages, but the sight of that soapsuds of beer at such a chilly
time of the day sends a shiver down my back. That my self-elected
escort does not share my prejudices is, however, attested by the evi
dent fact that this has not been his first trip outside in pursuit of
cooling refreshments. He lurches uncertainly up the stairs beside me,
spilling a trifle of his precious burden on my gown as we go, and
after translating the name of Edwin Sellon, for whom I inquire into
the more familiar cognomen of "Old Peg-Leg," kindly shows me into
the house parlor, there to await the arousing of Mr. and Mrs. Sallon
and their pleasure as to the reception of .their self-invited guest.
The parlor is a little square room fenced in with thin boards set
started in surprise and then informed me, in the gentlest manner possible
that he did not believe I had written it. I at first felt Insulted, but when
he informed me that he did not think me old enough to do such work of
such breadth of thought, such pathos and such perfect rhythm, I felt
different. He then pulled out. about $60 and counted it. He went through
all of his pockets, getting a few more dollars, and also called the cashier,
asking him how much, money there was In the drawer. Learning that
there was about $75, he turned to me In the blandest tones and said: 'Call
to-morrow at 3 and T- will have some collections in. I am willing to pay
for such work and I regret that I have not sufficient cash on hand.'
"I went away brimming with joy and I thought that I had at last
reached the land of gold. I.figured out that if I could grind out one poem
each week It would net me about $2*oo. When I came back next day the
bland little man did not appear to know me. He asked me my name and
when I told him he blankly : stared at me and, asked me how I spelled it.
I finally got him to understand that I had written a poem for the paper
and he seemed quite delighted and sent for the cashier,! The latter brought
out a lafee'sack of money and poured it out on the table. Mr. Marriott
got some more and for several minutes they were busy counting out $500.
While. the operation was going on I can safely" say that. l have never felt
such a wave of pleasure and pride roll over me In my, life. When he got
it counted he pushed two half-dollar pieces across the table and Bald:

men and : the shock nearly made me faint. , I wanted to take a chair and
wear it out over his head, but it occurred, to me that such a delicious prac
tical joker was worth knowing, so I took the dollar -and asked him out to
have a drink. We spent an hour together and created a friendship which
lasted until death." ; - . : .
A small band of writers, with Davis among them, afterward started
the Open Letter, a .weekly intended â -. to compete with the' News Letter.
One day Marriott, meeting Davis, told him that the News Letter intended
lambasting a certain combination of. doctors; that the Open Letter could be
their logical defender and if Sam wanted to j make some money, he could
have a friend suggest , to > the medical men that . he would champion their
cause. The latter was agreeable and In a few weeks the doctors had en
gaged Davis at $75 a week to: put Marriott on the rack. He proceeded to
do so and every week, after getting, his $75, would ; take Marriott over to
a popular French restaurant and. treat him to a gorgeous dinner."

their ecstacles, paid j him double, j He sought Marriott at once and Invited

Sixty years ago there was given to a wealthy family in far-off
Boston a lovely baby girlâ their first-bornâ who grew to womanhood
surrounded by every' luxury and enjoyed every indulgence that money
could bestow. Beautiful, graceful, accomplished, possessing far more
than ordinary mental gifts, this oldest daughter of a family of four
Bisters was the special pride and pet of her parents hearts. At the
age of eighteen she married, rather against her father's Judgment, a
young man named Sperry and took $10,000 with her as a wedding
present. Later her husband came to California, where she, with her
little son, presently joined him. â¢
A beautiful and well-bred woman, she was soon surrounded by
congenial acquaintances here and lived the usual life of well-cared
for young wives and mothers in her own comfortable and happy
home. She went East as the fancy seized her and visited her father
and sisters, receiving a generous allowance from her husband during
her absence. A happy and indulged wife, a loving and devoted
mother, an idolized daughter and a beloved sister, even in those har
monious days a "little rift" appeared which was destined "by and
by to make the music mute."
A love for alcoholic stimulants seemed born In the young wife,
and it was not long before her strictly reared Eastern family found"
reason to express themselves severely regarding certain lapses of
their, otherwise charming relative.
- Perhaps the right way was not taken with herâ perhaps there
was no right way; such cases have unhappily occurred. Be that as
it may, one thing is certain: Mrs. Angelina Sperry found herself,
less than, twenty years ago, the divorced wife of a man whose ex
ample ha"d not been one to help her in any way. the *ast-off mother
of a son whom she had : lovingly reared to manhood, and the repudi
ated sister of three women, each of whom thinks that the other
should "do something" for the reclamation of the black sheep of the
flock. \; S ..
Left to her own devices "Ann Sperry" drank more heavily than
ever. As a means of livelihood she who in her youth had found the
care of her own white hands task enough for each passing day learned .
and worked at the trade of tailor repairing and went out nursing
occasionally as occasion offered.
One of the women whom she nursed was Edwin Sellon's wife, a
frail little woman, who came out here with her crippled husband
some six years ago and died soon after.
Two years ago Edwin Sellon, who fought through the Civil War
in the glorious First Massachusetts Regiment, and Angle Sperry, the
Boston belle, the bright promise of whose youth had so sadly come
to naught, made up their minds to fight the world together.
Both were wellnigh penniless, practically homeless and alto
gether friendless. They joined misfortunes and since then
. Mrs. Sellon has . been telling me of herself quite unemotionally
and indifferently. She does not try to excuse herself by blaming
others, nor does she make any bid for remunerative sympathy.
"The world has been a little hard on me," she Bays,- "but I have
not been blameless. I was over-Indulged at flrst and afterward peo
ple were over-harsh. I married the wrong man and suffered for it. I
married too young to know my own mind, as many girls do. I have
known wealth and poverty, happiness and misery, but the happiness
has come last." ' 'â  -f -.â¢'..'-â â 
I look at her with sudden sharpness. The torn wrapper had In
advertently slipped aside, leaving one bony bare knee frankly ex-.
posed. She folds the soiled garment over It again and meets my
eyes squarely. :â -:."â 
"I love my present husband," she says, with a convincing little
emphasis upon the verb. "We are very poor, but we meet good and
ill fortune together. My son wants me to enter a home my home ls
here. None of my people will send me money, because they think
me foolish to link my life with a cripple. If I will leave him they will
help me, they sayâ as it is, I may starve."
A voice comes wavering out of the bedroom. "It would be wiser
of you if you listened to them, dear," it says, and the little woman
smiles at me brightly as she makes quick denial.
"Could I leave the man I love and who loves me to go out into
these streets alone, to come . home here alone, to be sick alone, to '
starve alone, perhaps, while I was well cared for?" she asks. "No,
madame, it is Impossible. Wherever you find it, among the rich or
the poor, if you find the real thingâ love is love."
! After the country had swallowed the bait, hook and all, the Open Letter
exposed the thing and called attention to Its many absurdities, the most
conspicuous of which was the scene where the engineer perished from cold
by the side of a roaring furnace, with wood enough to last for twenty-four
hours. '.fffff '.'â â  y:
Davis was always a practical joker, and is responsible for one of the
greatest journalistic jokes ever played on the coast. He was reporting the -
big $30,000 horse race between Thad Stevens, True Blue, etc:, when a re
porter of the Vallejo Chronicle came to him and said that he had lost
his credentials and wanted some one to pass him into the reporters' stand.-
Davis took good care that he would not get there and then volunteered
to send the unfortunate correspondent's dispatches for him. The latter.
gave him a note to the operator, authorizing him to use his signature,
and then the joker proceeded to send to the Chronicle a harrowing account '
of earthquake shocks that had struck the racetrack, demolishing the
grandstand and killing and wounding several hundred people. He de
scribed the mad rush for life with several thousand vehicles jamming the
gates and the running of the first heat, with Thad Stevens as winner.
Then came another shock in which Joe Daniels, one of the horses, was
killed by a stall which fell upon him. Notwithstanding this, the dispatches
said the sports were clearing ( away the dead and wounded and preparing
for the next heat. He continued to wire earthquakes with each heat and
piled up a harrowing description, while the inhabitants of Vallejo were
going mad with excitement. Leach, the publisher of the paper, never
doubted the authenticity of the dispatches, as they were signed by his
correspondent, and plastered them up on the bulletin boards, at the same
time issuing extras until the town was simply seething with excitement.
Then there was a rush for the wharf. Some speculative individual char
tered a boat and took 600 people down to San Francisco at $2 per head.
â¢ When they reached the city they inquired for the earthquake and
were regarded as crazy. When they comprehended the extent of the sell
they hunted up the reporter of the Chron
icle, but Sam had treated him too well,
and had landed him in the jail to keep
him out of harm's way. Next day Sam
sent Leach a bill for "three earthquake
shocks at $10 a shock," and he compre-
hended the extent of the situation.
Davis was a theatrical writer for years
and in touch with many of the celebrities
of the stage. Nothing suited him bet
ter than to play some prank at the ex
pense of the profession. When Sheridan
and Mack were producing "The " Long
Strike" in Virginia City, they asked Davis
if he would enact the role of the fore
man of the jury, In the situation where
a verdict is brought In, acquitting the

NICKNAMES GIVEN THE BOYS OF THE FIGHTING CALIFORNIA REGIMENT.
IN a military way the First Regiment
of California Volunteers is undoubted
ly the pride of California. Its efficien
cy and dicipline have been tried and
found not wanting. The active service
â¢ performed by this organization and
the manner in which the officers and men
have conducted themselves at all times
has earned for them the well bestowed
title of the .'Fighting First," the "Glori
ous First" and the "Gallant First."
It is the purpose of this article to show
in- a way the spirit of friendliness and
comradeship that pervades the regiment,
particularly among those in command.
All officers in the regular army have so-*
briquets or nicknames which most of
them acquired during the days of their
cadetship and which have stuck to them
through subsequent years. Our own First
Regiment is not behindhand in this mat
ter and every officer has his "off duty"
cognomen by which . he is familiarly
known, a great many of which have been
earned by little incidents with which they
were connected during the late war, and
serve to show that even during the most
serious of events there will always be
some one who will* see the ludicrous side
of things and comment accordingly, yy
Every one knows, of.course, the name
by .which Colonel James F. Smith is fa
miliarly known. He had in tact earned it
long before the war with Spain, and that
war has served to show that it was well
bestowed. So v far as the Philippines are
concerned he was the only one entitled
to a handle to his name, and right well
does he deserve the appellation of "Fight
ing Jim Smith." y
LIEUTENANT, COLONEL VICTOR
DUBOCE, the second in command, has
been a valuable man in directing the af
fairs of the regiment, particularly as to
matters of detail, and his many sugges
tions for the welfare of the regiment have
earned for him the title of "Little Sug
gestion" Duboce.
MAJOR BOXTON was troubled contin
ually with his feet and consequently pre
vented to some extent from attending to
regular routine duties." His trouble .earned
for him, the title of "Klondike Boxton."

of the Third Battalion, was a long time

trial rumors were rife of threatening
speeches made, by prominent Mataafa
chiefs against the whites in general,
and more particularly against the
Chief Justice, â¢ whose life was threat
ened. The threat against the Chief
Justice was no idle rumor, and, upon
affidavits being made, the three Con
suls held a meeting and agreed to issue
a proclamation placing the Chief Jus
tice, his family, his court and private
residence under the protection of the
three powers. The British and Ameri
can Consuls did as agreed upon, and
the English and American flags were
hoisted at the Chief Justice's private
residence, and the proclamation was is
sued by these two Consuls. The Ger
man Consul, for some reason or other,
did not carry out the engagement.
On December 31 the court gave its
decision, whereby it decreed that Ma-,
taafa was not rightly elected, and was
ineligible for the office, and that Tanu
had been rightfully elected King, con
formably with the provisions of the
Berlin treaty and the laws and customs 1
of Samoa not in conflict therewith. The
British and American Consuls: were
present at the decision, and were hand
ed copies of the decree, . -which ...they
publicly stated they would respect and
abide by. The German Consul was not
present, but the court sent him also
ing his battalion on the 13th of August

the Escolta he dismounted from his Phil
ippine pony, waved his sword high in air
and remarked that his work was done.
Since that time his title has been "My

time, for his rank as major entitled him
to a certain dignity Which he was not.al

of a lieutenant colonel.. which never came.

Carthy.

was an anxious- night for the

great*, number 'of whom were unarmed.

day, the " British Consul and Captain
Sturdee were seen all over Apia' trying
to quiet things and prevent fighting.
The loyal troops agreed not tq begin
hostilities and to keep the peace as long
as possible. All their efforts, however,
were unavailing, as .the. rebels were in
force and. were only waiting their own
time. They took possession of Matafele
(the western ward), and under instruc

an ex-German army officer," and who

All this time ' Yon Bulow and the
President and German Consul were in
consultation, and were constantly to

situation. The loyal troops were only
about two chains off. and a halt was
made. About "4 o'clock in the afternoon
the King (Tanu) arrived at the Tivoli

HYPNOTISM
BANISHED PAIN
. V-- .-- ;â¢'â¢'â  w
â¦ Singular Case of a Woman Who Was Put to Sleep. <$>
t- ' :"â¢ : â  . *,
NO great surgeon, ao far as I
know, ever invited a newspaper
! to send a scribe to tell what was
or was not done in the sanctum i
sanctorum, the operating room.
Neither did Dr. Schurmeir do any such
thing. Nevertheless, I saw him do what
impressed me so deeply that nothing
has seemed quite the same since. *
It was hypnotism in surgery. He per
formed what the profession call a
major operation, using no more tangi
ble anesthetic than a command, quietly,
gently, but firmly; given.
"Think how sleepy you are, how
heavy your eyes are. You will soon
fall asleep. You. cannot waken till I
call you. You suffer no pain; you only
sleep, and cannot waken till I call you." ,
Dr. Schurmeir is not a Californlan,
nor yet an American. He comes from
Germany, from the country which fur
nishes the theories for the rest of the
world to work out. He is, as he says,
"seeing, something of the rest of the
world," and for a few months is in San
Francisco.
It Was after dinner, and we were
talking of many things which had led
0000000000000000000000000000000000
Member of Congress from the Philip pinesâ Whatever became of that bill to
annex Mars .to the United States? -
The other M. C.-Oh. we defeated that at the poles.
up to hypnotism, Christian science and
faith cures. : ''':'b'b''b- : rbb r
i Dr. Schurmeir had taken no part in
the conversation, but now he said:
"Imagination, yes; and fraud, yes.
But what is fraud and, also, what is
imagination?" -, .. .
Then we found out that Dr. Schur
meir had studied hypnotism in its dif
ferent aspects very carefully.
"Twenty years ago," he said, "I was
as much interested in these things an
you are now. Charcot went through
Germany, and I heard him speak* and
saw him perform some wonders in hyp
notism. I found I had a good deal of
power and used it at every opportunity.
1 never.use it for mere amusement now.
It is too dangerous a thing to play
with."
"But you do use it?"
"A great many physicians use it in
their practice." v
"Yes?"
"Do you not know that there is a
course of lectures on the subject, given
at Toland? There may be at Cooper
as well, for aught I can say."
"Why is it used In medicine and sur
gery?" - . ..
. "It takes a good deal of time. and a
good deal of trouble. In surgery cer
tainly it is easier to say to the attend
ant, 'Give an anesthetic' It is less
trouble, but sometimes there are rea
sons why an anesthetic may. not be
used. â¢ Then I use hypnotism." '.
"And they feel no pain, or do they
feel it but do not know it?" "yy
"But what is pain? It is just the
knowing it."
. "Then there is no shock to the sys
tem?" ;
"Not as much as.to A's system when
B's finger is cut." ;â " -
Thinking it ov* afterward [ Iâ ; kept
wishing that I could see Dr. Schurmeir
practice what he had been" preaching.

And I had my wish, but it was not
what I had expected.
About three weeks ago a lady had
been thrown from her carriage and in
jured. It was decided that only a seri
ous operation could restore her. The
injury. had shattered her nervous sys
tem, and ' to her pain was added the
tortures of a clever, sensitive woman
who feels she is losing her mind.
â¢ I had been sitting with her; her own
family she had banished. Her physi
cian came in, and with him was Dr.
Schurmeir. She was in great pain, and
I knew that- the outcome of her Illness
was causing her physicians grave ap
prehension.
Dr. Schurmeir sat down beside her.
He is a large man, giving, one the Im
pression of perfect healthâ mens sana
in corpore sano. He is a man who has
seen much of life and lived, and has.
the gentleness which, a brave man al
ways has and a something besides
which makes one trust him and want
to know him betterâ that something
which makes a stray dog, accustomed
to kicks, get close to him, wag his tail
and whimper for. a word. He laid his
hand on the sick woman's â the
large, slender, flexible hand of the stu
dent with the bent back thumb of an
enthusiast and extremist, large but bal
anced. Talking quietly to the patient
he held her eyes by his own, which
were wide open and so intense that
they seemed two points of fascination.
The muscles of his neck stood out. He
was saying in a low voice with a con
tinuous monotonous downward inflec
tion: 'fyf'fffffyfffi
"You are very tired, you have suf
fered so much, you are worn out and
your eyes are so heavy. You are sleepy,
sleepy, sleepy. You will sleep and feel
no pain. Your pain Is less and less.
You will sleep and rest without pain
for two hours. You will sleep, sleep,
sleep."
First she left off answering, and her
eyes, became -attentive and then fixed
upon the doctor. All the fears and
sorrows tormenting her soul and all the
pain in its hurt body were scattered be
fore his commanding will. She slept
quietly and deeply, and the worn look
of illness was replaced by beloved rest.
There were technical directions to the
nurse for the operation which was to
occur on the following day, and with
her husband's consent I might be
present. ,* , -/ " .
In two hours, almost to a moment,
the sick -woman opened her eyes. Dr.
Schurmeir gave her. some broth from a
bowl, saying to her: "It will not dis
agree with you ; you are hungry and It
tastes good. - Think how hungry and
tired you â¢ are. You will soon sleep
again' and have no pain for two hours."

She took the broth, which before had
been nauseating to her, and quietly fell
asleep again. : ..-â¢â¢-'â '
In a small upper room' all the furni
ture had been removed. Even the paper
had been scraped from the wall and
everything washed with" antiseptics.
Only a long table and a smaller table
with basins and sponges Â and ; bright
blades, and shining instruments which
nurses lay out ready for the surgeon's
hand. There were glass jars and some
thing rolled In towels* and a chair ready
for the surgeon, near the table. Two
nurses with negative faces effaced all
personality in white, gowns, -unironed
but clean and smelling of hospitals.
Two surgeons in white unironed coats
had scoured their hands and were wait
ing for the patient, whom Dr. Schur
meir was putting- tp sleep in another
room as he had done the day before.
When she had been laid on the table,
sleeping deeply, she was no longer
"she," but only a "case." It is told
that in clinics they joke and tell funny
stories while they cut up and sew up
their fellows, but every one in that
room was very serious.
Dr. Schurmeir stood over the patient
with his thumb on the bridge of her
nose and his fingers on top of her head.
"You cannot feel pain; you have no
pain. You are sleeping and resting, so
you will soon be well and walking
about. You have no pain; you cannot
wake till I command you to."
He lifted an eyelid. There was no
sense of the light. Then he thrust a
needle under the nail of her little
finger and nodded his head. The nurses
quickly arranged everything, and the
surgeon who was to operate held up
his hand:
"Knife! Time!"
"Tenâ nine!" Then a sound of the
knife. I felt weak and my knees re
â  fused to obey me. I dared not look
away from the face of the woman on
the table, but I knew that blood was
flowing. Her face was not paleâ there
was an expression of perfect peace, not
a quiver nor a shudder.
"You had better go outâ you, I mean;
don't you understand? Go out of the
room."
But I could not for that dull cutting
sound 1,111 some- one led me out. Outside
was her husband, walking up and down
the hall before the door. When a "case"
is not a "case," but a wife or friend;
you cannot stand things as a nurse or

GOSSIP OF A SOCIETY BUD
MY DEAREST MARGUERITE: 1
A gossip can put two and two to- |
gether and make fourteen out j
of it. To be able to make a '
mountain out of a mole hill Is
a rudimentary law in the ethics of her
profession. But her mathematical feat
pales Into Insignificance' when compared.
to the modern journalist. Given nothing
to add to nothihg, he computes the sum
total as something. Proof: The vast
amount of printer's ink spilled over the
two little decorative pages who are to
appear for a brief moment at the Mardi
Gras.
. The two pages in question are not those
of fame that were stolen out of Satan's
book, but on the contrary they are two
diminutive fairies of fourteen years each,
who are wont nightly to raise the hopes
and fancies of the occupants of the bald
headed row. These two damsels, In real
tights, are 1 to appear at the Mardi Gras.
Davis and Duval â¢ are the aristocratic
names of these two necessaries of royalty,
and for a consideration they are to play
( for -'a*, brief time attendance on the king,
and then for the sake of well-regulated
propriety they will disappear from mortal |
gaze, and return to their- Mission-street j
homes. Not even a taste of the royal
bumper is to be the portion of the two j
little- hirelings. Sad their lot, yet so
ciety has decreed that they, are to add to j
the realism of the festivities; not under j
any consideration are they to be partici- ,
pants. â¢ ]â â 'â ''
The fastidious Ned has chosen the two |
pages, and this is a guarantee to the i
chappies, who swear by Greenway and j
his dictums, that the pages will be
dreams of brief delight and sources of
pleasure for the reason that, although
their complexions may be detachable,'
their will look just as natural as they
do from the front row. I could really
give a cheer for Ned. The horrid papers
have placed him in -the wrong light in this
matter of the pages. Really, there was ;
no quarreling among the chorus at the
Tivoli as a result of the choice of Misses
Davis and Duval. They were secured for |
a consideration, dearest Peg, you know, j
and simply because we girls refused to '
follow the example of gay Paris. It was I
because of this that Greenway, after con
sulting many of his friends and others I
who are to be there, hit on the plan of !
perfecting the evening by securing the
two pages.
Â« They had to have the pages, for who- j
ever heard of a King without them, and j
since Jack . Wilson is to be. the Merry
Monarch, and you know that Jack Is a
connoisseur, why of course he Insisted on
the real thing. So Prince Carnival will
have his court attendants, Including the
pages, notwithstanding what the papers
say, and there is no denying that so
ciety is looking forward to this feature
and under its breath is congratulating it
self that Ned took 1 the stand that he did.
The Herald, court jesterâ ln fact, all
the rest of the royal party > have been
chosen from the sacred ' inner circle!
Harry Dimond, with becoming . modesty,
forgot his shyness long enough to consent
to delight the merry revelers in a cos
tume fully befitting the Herald- to H. R.
H. Prince Carnival. Tony Hellman Is to
be court jester, and he can be depended
upon to right merrily jingle his bellsâ
those internally as well as the external
ones. Two naval officers will shed the
glory of gold lace on the regal party.

Shirred sleeves are always beautiful and
unusually becoming, as they seem to en

shirred sleeve has no puffings at all, the

closely and minutely in hoops about the
arm Is equally pretty and fashionable,
and is especially nice done in white cam

Shoulders in summer gowns are to be
generally left plain, and where tiny ruffles
encircle the decolletage they will not en
circle the shoulders. A bertha effect of
embroidery in a flat incrustation is pret

The winter girl cannot wait for sum
mer to don the shirt waist. All winter
she has been wearing silk shirt waists.
But the very latest shirt waist for n*e
house and under the tailor jacket ls
made of white satin. They are consid
ered particularly swell, especially if the
jacket worn over them be lined with
white satin. This may sound extrava
gant, but the white satin shirt waist can
. be cleaned, and the satin does not crack
and wear out like taffeta.
The white shirt waists are made perfect
ly plain. There should neither be tucks
' nor cording.
The white corded silk and bengallne
waists are effective. They are made up
simply and are fastened with jeweled or
crystal buttons. The sleeves are made
like dress sleeves and are finished at the
wrist with flaring cuffs, inside of which
are ruffles of lace. There is usually 9ja
bot of lace worn with these waists, giving
them a jaunty air. They look at first
rather incongruous with the heavy cloth
gowns, but it is fashionable to wear them
and so they are worn. Â«
* * *
The most expensive of all waists r"-e
those of uncut velvet, made with a yoke
and narrow vest of lace, and below tne
yoke a trimming on the velvet of
pailettes of different colors and a border
ribbon. These waists have small sleeves,
with pointed cuffs, completely covered with
pailettes and the ribbon trimming. Few
black silk or satin waists are worn ex
cept by people who are in mourning.
When they are worn they must always
have a bright i.c or some lace at the
throat. The satin ones look particularly
well when they have rows of the ' >rding
put on the bias. The cording seems to
relievo the dead black of the satin. A
heavy quality of black satin should never
be used; it is too stiff and unyieldingâ

the liberty satin is a good material for
anything of this sort.
Just now there is a craze for the em
broidered velvets and satins. They are
more on the mirror velvet order, with a
watered effect, with white embroidered
polka dots of white satin or white floss
silk. There are also some heavy satins
(heavy in quality but light in weight) that
make up charmingly into waists. They
are made in as simple a style as possible,
the beauty of the material giving them a
smart look. They have fitted linings, and
some fullness in front. The effect is that
of a fitted waist rather than the loose,
shapeless things that were the first that
were seen.

BEAUTY TALKS: THE CARE OF THE HAIR
This department is for the benefit of all those who are interested i n the science of cosmetics anu the hy
giene of proper living. If any one desires information oil either of these subjects the questions will be cheer

JUDGING from the numerous
plaints that come my way, half
the women of California are in
imminent danger of .becoming in
imminent danger of becoming as
baldheaded as a Rocky Mountain
eagle. Of all the woes of beauty-seeking
femininity this one of tresses that utterly
refuse to stay "put" and that insist upon
distributing themselves all about the
house seems to be the foremost and most
appalling. 1 am constantly receiving woe
ful tales of poor, miserable little wisps of
hair that roll up into a twist no larger
around than a lead pencil, or of exactly
fourteen hairs of fourteen ; different
lengths that give every evidence of going
the way of all the rest of the members
of a once luxuriant family of hairs.
Really, it's pitiful!
"If a man have long hair it Is a shame
unto him," according to St. Paul. But if
a woman be the possessor of long, luxuri
ant locks it may be the means of redeem
ing a whole host of irregular features.
So, girls, it behooves you, if you do not
wish to degenerate into a race of women
with heads as smooth as billiard balls, to
give patient and systematic care to that
â glory" about which lovers have raved
and poets sung ever since time was.
Really, I do not wonder at the paucity
of feminine locks when I see the treat
ment that some women give their hair.
If an obstinate tangle is encountered they
will plunge the comb into the very midst
of it and pull and tug until the poor little
knotted portion is violently wrenched
away from the rest of the hair. When
shampooing they will scratch the scalp
with the nails, dig and scrub with the
Angers as vigorously as though it were a
carpet they were endeavoring â¢to clean,
instead of a mass of delicate silken
strands.
Almost any woman can have pretty hair
if she will give a little time to it;' and
use good, common sense, which -seems to
be such an uncommon commodity .these
days. You have ,no idea how soon, by
systematic brushing, a rough or dull head
of hair can be transformed into a smooth

A very nice hatpin, with a head of am

a band of pearls connected with the hat
pin by a gold chain. The pearl band Is
used as a brooch or as a pin upon the
breast.
The gold chain dangles from the hat

any jewels or plain gold.

TAILOR
MADE GIRLS
The average man would laugh to scorn
an assertion that the tailor made girl has
quite as many tantalizing things to con
tend with in dressing herself for that
"simple smartness" characterizing her as
he himself has in arranging his own
faultless linen. He doesn't dream how
well groomed femininity has many times
a wee!: to suppress wrath akin to that
which so freely. bubbles between his own
lips because of the same aggravating ca
prices of an inoffensive looking collar but
ton. It never enters his mind that the
fetching Ascot has perhaps caused her to
storm up and down before her mirrors,
calling on the gods to come down and
help her tie the thing. He knows well
enough the myriad offenses of his own
neckgear and the wrath with which he
has pounced upon his laundry king, but
the shy little thing at his sideâ why, of
course, she does, not know what trou
ble is.
The tailor made girl has to avoid th*}
least suggestion of ''fluffiness." Her hair
should not lo6k fluffy, nor the feathers on
her hat. Her shirt waist is hopeless if
not thoroughly severe, and her tie must
receive just the right twist.

hour wrestling desperately with stiff col
lars that simply refused to button, first

brushed regularly every night, chiefly for
the purpose of ridding the silky strands
of the dust and flaky particles which
have accumulated during the day. After
the hair has been taken down it should -be :
untangled and straightened with a coarse
comb, then divided from the center of the
forehead to the nape of the neck, and
brushed on each side until it is soft
and glossy looking. Draw the brush
llrmly but gently over the scalp
and down through the entire length of
the hair at each stroke, and. let the
strokes follow each other in quite rapid
succession, as in this way a slight cur
rent of electricity Is generated, which
stimulates the life and growth of the
hair.
Brushes should have long, uneven bris
tles, and should be kept scrupulously
clean by frequent washings- in ammonia
water. Do not put them in the sunlight
to dry, but in an open window instead.
After the hair has been thoroughly
brushed, plait it. into two loose braids.
Two braids are better than one, because .
they permit of better ventilation, lack of
which is frequently the cause of falling
hair. Hair that has been tightly twisted
through the day needs relaxation and
rest when night comes.
It Is difficult to say how often the hair
should be shampooed, as lt depends great
ly upon the nature and quantity of the
hair and the condition of the scalp. Hair
that is naturally oily should" be washed
at least once a fortnight, while hair that
is dry should not be given a bath of tener
than once a month.
The scalp must be kept scrupulously
clean. After the hair has-been washed it
must be well rinsed in several waters, and
1 doubt if this can be thoroughly-done
without, the use of running water, the
bath spray being the most convenient
method of getting this. The hair should
come out fluffy and soft and there should
be absolutely no suggestion of that white,
sticky substance that frequently clings
to the teeth of the comb after a shampoo.
A very delightful shampoo is made by
cutting into small pieces one-half pound
of pure castile soap. Put in a porcelain
kettle with two quarts of warm water
and dissolve ,by boiling. When cold it
should be of * the consistency |of rather
thin cream. If thicker add more water.-
Stir in one-fourth ; pint of alcohol | and let
stand for several days In a warm room.

search, but the button was discovered at

little string that persists in twisting itself

The tailor made girl's boot string takes
advantage of her dependence upon it and
breaks just as she is making a hurried
toilet. Not another pair to her name, and
just twenty minutes to keep her engage

Her hair positively refuses sometimes to
part straight, and one . persistent tress
makes her a half hour late at the play.

WHEN PAPA'S SICK
WHEN papa's sick, my goodness
sakes!
Such awful, awful times it makes;
' He speaks in, oh! such, lonesome
tones,
And gives such ghas'ly kind of groans.
And rolls his eyes and holds his head,
And makes ma help him up to bed.
While Sis and Bridget run to heat
Hot water bags to warm his feet;
And 1 must get the doctor quickâ
We have to jump when papa's sick.
When papa's sick ma has to stand
Right side the bed and hold his hand,
While Sis she has to fan an' fan.
For he says he's "a dyin' man."
And wants the children round him to Â»
Be there when "sufferin' ,pa gets
through";
He says he wants to say good by
And kiss us all and then he'll die;
Then moans and says his "breathin's
thick"â ,
It's awful sad when papa's sick.
When papa's sick he acts that way
Until he hears the doctor sayâ
"You've only got a cold, you know;
You'll be all right'n a day or so";
And thenâ well, say! you ought to see,
He's different as he can be.
And growls and swears from noon to
night "â 
Just 'cause his dinner ain't cooked right,
And all he does is fuss and kickâ
We're all used up when papa's sick.
âJoe Lincoln in the L. A. W. Bulletin.
All the alkali and impurities will settle
to the bottom of the bottle, leaving the
liquid as clear as crystal. Pour this off
carefully and perfume with a few drops
of essence of verbena.. After you have
shampooed and thoroughly rinsed your
hair with the bath spray dry it with
warm towels, and then if you' can get
some one to massage the scalp for you
it will start up the circulation, invigorate
the hair bulbs and almost invariably pre
vent you from taking cold. Do not begin
to comb your hair out until it is perfectly'
dry. A sun bath will do It no end of good
and while you are giving it you can busy
yourself snipping eff all the little split
ends of the hair, which will not grow as
long as the ends remain.
When the hair is naturally oily add a des
sertspoonful of ammonia and a pinch of
borax to two quarts of warm water When
shampooing. An occasional egg shampoo
Is excellent for any sort of a head, par
ticularly if one has just recovered from a
fever or any illness that has left the
scalp in unhealthy condition. The yolk of
an egg, one ounce of rosemary spirits and
one pint of very warm water is a simple
recipe and particularly good for dandruff.
This: condition of the scalp is nearly al
ways the result of neglect.
White hair that is inclined to become .
yellow should be washed with the whites
of two, eggs, beaten up with a teaspoon
ful of salts of tartar.
When the hair begins to fall, one should
try first of all to find out what is the
real cause of it. and then proceed to. ban
ish it. Dyspepsia, worry,, overstudy, late
hours, anxiety and ill-health will all .*ring
about this unhappy condition, and' unless
the real trouble at the seat of the difficul
ty is discovered and corrected, tonics and
lotions will be of .little benefit. v. y
Orange phosphates, taken before meals,
frequently has a good effect upon- the hair,
keeping it from falling out in such terri
fying quantities, and it will also inspire
it to more ambitious growth. v
"Very often a firm; invigorating massage
of the scalp is all that the hair needs to
stimulate its growth. When the hair is
very dry and brittle and* looks as lifeless
as a feather boa that has been out in a
rainstorm, - then use a little warm *, olive
oil. Sage tea is a -good all-round tonic,
and will slightly darken the hair.
A tonic that is excellent for light hair
as it is also for darker locks and which
can be fcafaly used by the girl who Is af
flicted with oily hair is: Four ounces co
logne, one-half ounce tincture of canthar
ides and one-fourth dram each of oil of
lavender and oil df rosemary. Apply to
the roots of the hair once or twice a day
with a small sponge. While using this
tonic shampoo once a week with the liquid
soap. â â¢ â  . - _Â_..
A splendid cure for dandruff, which is
also a good tonic for falling tresses, is the
following:. Forty-eight grains resorcin.
one-half ounce glycerine and alcohol
enough to fill a two-ounce bottle. Apply
every night, rubbing it into the scalp.
This will get rid of the dandruff in a jiffy.
cleanse the scalp and invigorate the hair
roots.

Essence of cucumber. 3 ounces.
Tincture of benzoin, 38 drops.
Cut the cucumbers into small pieces, re
moving neither the skin nor the seeds, and
pour on just enough water to start them
to cooking. When cooked soft and mushy,
strain through a piece of muslin. The
essence you can make yourself by taking
one and a half ounces of alcohol and one

let it stand for several hours, until the"
soap has entirely dissolved. Then put in

all are thoroughly mixed. Then pour it
all out into a china or porcelain vessel
and add the almond oil and the benzoin, j
stirring for some time. When you put j
the mixture into bottles, be sure that it !
is well mixed, else you will get most of i
the oily matter in one bottle and the j
juice in another. It will be a creamy, j
yellow liquid, and should always be well
shaken before* using. Apply it at night,
letting it dry on the skin, and rinse away
with tepid water in the morning. Cut
off all the split ends of your hair and ap- j

HATTIE S.â Tlje best way to get rid of
superfluous flesh is to pay strict atten
tion to the diet. For breakfast eat fresh
uncooked fruit, especially oranges. Take
neither milk nor sugar in your coffee;
substitute toast for bread and eat spar
ingly of butter. Avoid fats, cereals,
starchy vegetables and pastries. Candy
and. sweets of all kinds must he rigidly
excluded from the dietary. Meats, either
cold or boiled, are good, if eaten in mod
eration. Poultry, iish and game are all
right. String beans, tomatoes, spinach
and asparagus may be indulged in; also
all kinds of salad, with the oil omitted, of
course. A hot lemonade. With very lit
tle sugar in it. taken every night, will
help. Do not drink much water and take
lots of exercise in the open air. There,
my little girl, if you will follow those di
rections religiously, you will soon throw
off the ten pounds that are worrying you.
Don't starve yourself, for, at your age
you need all the nourishment that you
can get.

NATIVE DAUGHTERS' . RED CROSS.
During the early stages of the Spanish-
American war. the Native Daughters or
ganized a Red Cross Society and did much
for the soldiers who were awaiting trans
portation to Manila. Among other things
which the society did was to send $700 to
Colonel James F. Smith for the benefit of
the First California Regiment at the
front. A few days since a member of one
l of the local parlors received a letter from
j Captain O. F. Huber, commanding Com
pany I oi the First California, who is a
member of National Parlor, N. 8. G. W.
in; which he says:
I spoke to Colonel . Smith about the $700 the
Native Daughters' Red Cross Aid Society sent
him. He told trie that he had received the
check and had written a letter of acknowl-
I edgment, thanking your worthy society on be
-1 half of the regiment. The money will be used ]
; to a good purpose. Our regiment has a hos- i
i pital at Ermita; a suburb of Manila, where
j only the sick of our regiment I are treated. It
| costs considerable to minister to the wants of
' about seventy-five sick dally. The expenses of i
t the hospital have been â¢ paid with Red Cross

since the decline of those of Ceylon and
the ( Persian - Gulf divide with the north
coast of Australia the reputation of be
ing the most valuable in the world. These
pearl fisheries promise to furnish great
opportunities for the investment of
American capital.
Like many other fields of . enterprise
in that part of the world, the Sulu
pearling grounds have, for some, time,
been controlled by men or companies
with large capital, of which the chief
is the great London jewelry firm of
Streeter. These capitalists equip and
send out fleets of from twenty to thirty
moderate sized schooners upon annual
cruises, and employ in the pursuit be
sides numerous European officers and
supercargoes, many hundreds, If not
thousands, of native divers./ Kfy

cargo is landed and piled high oh the

assist in the decomposition of the dead-,
fish, so that the pearls may be the more,
easily obtained.
During the cleaning and washing pro- .

discover the loose pearls, which, being
nearly all perfect spheres, are the most
valuable for stringing or necklace pur

reception of the "seed" pearls is reached.
Having been sized in this manner, â  the
pearls are then sorted as to color, weighed

the people, have tired of; the standard
drama; ask the- people. they will
fell you thai they are tiVed of the imi

â¢ blame the people; the people' blame

and- bad actors buy real -estate and

after all, seeing .any kind of a per

â¢ that so many persons are now crowding
to the Columbia to -see Shakespeare
and Sheridan exploited by Louis James,
Kattaryn Kidder and Frederick Ward-,.
Time and again I have heard actors
who were down on their luck say that
the public was fickle. and ungrateful,
! that it forgot and forgave them their
successes and remembered and treas
ured their failures. Hut this triple-
.ted star season of ours doesn't look
'. that. way. The last, visit but this of
' Mr. Jam. was a frightful failure. Mr..
â¢Warde's. ditto. Now that these actors
, have Siamezed again and sandwiched
around the unique talent of Miss Kid
der their season seems. one glad round
of applause, sunshine, fruit and flow
.. ers. People rush to the Columbia as
though James-Kidder- Warde were the
.â gr eatest actors' extant and Brinsley
Sheridan and William Shakespeare the
.most popular play-writers. Why. actu
. ally these plays and players are doing
greater business than Frank Daniels
' and his dude-pursued beauties did "in
the silliest, frothiest comic operas ever
'written. And the press agents and.
...dramatic critics are rivalling one an
. " other in congratulating the toWn on its
. good taste. Personally, I don't take
much stock, in these, congratulations,
â¢ because I have noticed very little
.change in the crowd at the Columbia;
.the same hands and heels that now
: storm applause for Kathryn Kidder
.; and Messrs. W'arde and James in clas
sic comedy and tragedy did just as
much for little Mr. Daniels and his

term of reproach. The youngsters have I
done little or nothing in the legitimate:
and the survivors of the palmy days
.ire not and never have been acknowl- I
edged artists. There is no profile, no Im- j
mense originality in their work. They I
have clung to the old fake stride and
gesture and have pitched their voices so
deep in the bowels that children cried
at them. They have lacked humanness.
Instead of coming "fresh from life."
they have come "stale from the stage."
For this reason most Shakespearean
performances have seemed to me and
to many others as unrealistic as an
old-fashioned Italian opera. The best
I could do was to give up all Idea of
dramatic illusion and center my pleas
ure in the strength and melody of the
lines. So it was with something
, stronger than Impersonal delight that
I acknowledged .throughout the past
week the bits of life-like acting that il
luminated the -James-Kidder- Warde
performances. Mr. James especially is
to be congratulated. Last year- his
work was- grossly exaggerated, and
now by a generous moderation of him
self he is able to present a vigorous,
even thrilling Othello, and a Charles
Surface of irresistible dash and humor.

Commencing to-morrow evening the sec
ond and last week of the triple-star en
gagement will be inaugurated with a pre
sentation of. "Julius Caesar," in which
Mr. James will be seen as the philosoph
ical Brutus', Mr. Warde as Marc Antony
and Miss Kidder ah Portia. The part of
Cassius will be In- the hands of Barry
Johnson, and the veteran, Harry Lang
don, will be the Casea. "Caesar" will be
repeated on Saturday, evening. For the
balance of the engagement the repertoire
will be as follows; Tuesday and Sunday
evenings, "The" School for Scandal";
Wednesday evening and Saturday mati
nee. "Hamlet"; Thursday evening. "Mac
beth," and Friday evening. "Othello."
The bill for this evening is "Othello."

.to follow the James-Kidder- Warde com
bination at .the Columbia Theater or

corrupt pagan nation. The leading roles
will be played by. Charles Dalton, Irene

giving unusual satisfaction to the pa
trons. Encouraged by the popular suc
cess of last year the troubadours come to
the Pacific Coast with an improved com
pany, a new repertoire and a record of
overland triumphs. :.....-*â -
Sissieretta Jones (the Black Patti), Er- j
nest Hogan, the unbleached American; !
Mattie Phillips, "the real thing"; Gus
Hall, Anthony Byrd, W. C. Frai-ier and '
that trio of pretty creole soubrettes, Alice
Mackey and the Merideth Sisters, are
among last season's favorites who are re
tained. Among the newcomers are George â 
Holt, tenor; James Lightfoot. basso; Mu
riel Ringgold a pickaninny dancing won
der; James Bland, the elongated come- I
-1 dlan; Judson Hicks and W. C. Cook, two
clever "coon" comedians and crackajack
cake-walkers. While the stage perform
ance follows the same lines as that of
fered last season, it has been further em
bellished by new specialties, the latest
rag-time ballads, the newest cake-walks
and an entirely new operatic kaleidoscope.
The /\lcazar. b
"Peaceful Valley" will be given its last
performance at the Alcazar this evening.
For the new week Nat C. Goodwin's old
success, "A Gold Mine," will be the of
fering. . The play was first produced by
Mr. Goodwin in the season of 1888 at the
Fifth Avenue Theater, New York, and
later at the Gaiety Theater, London. The
Frawley company gave it here a couple
of seasons ago, with William Lackaye In
the leading part.
The story is of a California mine pro
moter who goes to London and financially
sacrifices himself instead of the usual vic
tims, thereby winning, a charming wife
and helping along several other matri
moriial and pecuniary problems. Mr.
Hastings will play the Goodwin; part and
George Osbourne the English broker. All
the Alcazar favorites are in the cast. A
revival of "The Girl I Left Behind Me"
follows. â¢â â¢â¢ :â¢â '-â -"'. â  /

After . much careful-' preparation the
Tivoli Opera House will present on Mon
day night for the first timÂ» in. this city a
new opera which was most successful
throughout the East, â¢ "Madeleine, or the
Magic Kiss." It is the work of Stanis
laus Stange . and Julian Edwards, the au
thors and composers, of the "Wedding
Day" and "Brian Boru." It is founded
upon a legend -concerning the house of
De Grimm, which prophesies that any
baron of that line who remains a bache
lor and reaches the age of 100 years may,
on attaining his hundredth birthday, have
seventy-five years taken off his age, pro
viding he is kissed before noon of that
day by a maiden who has attained her
majority without ever having been kissed
by man or boy. Miss Anna Lichter will
reappear in the title role; Annie Myers
will be seen as Mary Doodle, the sextet
widow; Bernice Holmes and Ida Wyatt.
I as Dr. Gourmet's daughters, Vivette and
Margot. Phil Branson will portray the I
role of Baron de Grimm; Edwin Stevens
will be his physician. Dr. Gourmet; Wm.
H. West, his scribe, Jules Le Meagre; and
Arthur Boyce, his steward, Francois.
William Pruette will be the Alsatian art
ist, Auguste Deutch, and William Schus
ter, the baron's majordomo, Emlle.
Jhe Orpheum.
The Orpheum promises a great bill for
this week. There are Conroy and Mc-
Donald, known to the vaudeville world
as the "kings of Irish comedy"; De Haven
and Maie, the youngest sketch team in
America;. P. C. . Shortls, the musical
monologlst, and Lang and Keller, vocal
ists and comedians. Conroy and McDon
ald are said to be the best in their line.
Carter de Haven has been seen here be
fore. He is now assisted by Bonnie Maie,
a little miss of 14. who is said to be quite
as clever as her "leading man." From
last week there remain Professor Macart
and his troupe of dogs and monkeys,
Milton and Dollie Nobles in a new com
edy sketch entitled "Bllgevllle Junction,"
Schrode brothers, comedy acrobats, and
Stine and Evans-, the singing comedians. \

The hard work Involved in playing. "Cy
rano de Bergerac" has made Richard
Mansfield a positive slave to routine. His
physician allows him to see no one during
the day, as a measure of rest and as a
preventive against talking, for Mr. Mans
field has to give his throat-continued rest
in order to preserve the energy for the
five acts of Cyrano. .He not only speaks
continually through the play, but each
evening about 10 o'clock, the time of the
moon scene with De Guiche, he sings in
a rich barytone voice for seven minutes,
and an hour later does a death scene
requiring the most vigorous and impas
sioned work of the evening.
Charles H. Hoyt, the playwright and
theatrical manager, is badly broken down
in health. His new farce, "A Dog in the
Manger," was .produced in Washington
last Monday night. It. failed utterly, and
the company will be disbanded at the end
of the week. The piece was not of itself
up to Mr. Hoyt's average, and, still more
detrimental, its performance lacked the
personal direction of the author. It will
be laid aside to await his recovery of
health, which he hopes will come of long
rest and diverting travel. v
New Orleans is likely to enjoy a legal
battle over "A Lady of Quality." Both
Miss Julia Arthur and Miss Eugenia Blair
have announced their intention of doing
the play there. Miss Arthur says she has
the prior, right, but Miss Blair says she
has the permission of Mrs. Frances Hodg
son Burnett, the author. * t yy â¢ "
CRICKETERS HONOR A COMRADE
Alameda Club Presents the Hunter
Harrison Cup to R. B. Hogue.
Of the local cricket clubs the Alameda
has been the first to hold its annual meet
ing and election of officers. The following
were chosen to serve the club during' the
season of 1899: President, Edward Brown;
vice ; presidents, Robert B. Hogue and
Henry Ward; secretary and treasurer,
Henry "Ward; members of 'executive com
mitteeâHenry Ward, J. J. Moriarty and
J. H. Saunders; members of ground com
mitteeâJ. H. Saunders, W. G. - Fortman
and B. Bird; delegates to the California
Cricket Associationâ Henry Ward and J.
J. Moriarty.
Edward Brown, who is also president
of the California Cricket Association, will
be absent from the State during a great
part of the year on a visit to England,
and it is not unlikely that Robert B.
Hogue will return to New, South Wales,
thus leaving Henry Ward, who is already
Lord High Everything Else of the Ala
meda Club, the absolute Pooh Bah of the

After the formal business or the meet-
ing had been transacted the silver tfup
presented by J. Hunter Harrison to the
California Cricket Association, and wort
by the Alameda Club in 1895, 1897 and 1838,
was presented to Robert B. Hogue. The
Alameda Club possesses no club-house in
which trophies won can be safely kept
and exhibited, and having presented the
cup given by W. Greer Harrison to Ed
ward Brown, president of the club,
thought it could not do better than, give
the Hunter. Harrison trophy to Robert B.
Hogue, who has rendered eminent serv
ices to cricket in San Francisco. 1 Though
R. B. Hdgue did not win the first Burnell
prize given last season for the- highest
batting average (this being earned off by
J. J. Moriarty with an average of 3p-6.
in all matches sanctioned by the Califor
nia Cricket Association), he mad. the
highest average in the five two-day
matches for the Hunter ' Harrison" cup,
viz., the' very creditable average of .3.42

:"â¢" ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT. â¢ i
NEW YORK. Feb. 11.â The Financier says:
â  The statement of the Associated Banks of NeW
York for the week ending February ' 11 â¢ was
again at variance" with supposed Operations
covering the past six days. Instead of gaining
eome.thlng like $2,000,000 in cash reserves, due to
.receipts from the interior, ' the actual increase
was practically nothing, losses In* legal . ten
â  ders offsetting specie expansion.- Whether the
actual condition of the banks .is- reflected In
the statement is not doubtful. At any rate
â¢ special. causes contributed s**- largely In deter-'
mining the totals that analysis is rather diffi
cult. Of the total gain of $8,500,000 deposits
the National City Bank alone 1s responsible for
_ nearly $5,250,000. and. with the National : Park.
. Bank more than accounts for the entire- in
crease. So in loans the National - .(.-Itv Bank
" reports an expansion of $6,50-,-000. And the. pe--.
malnder of the $B,o**o, gain Is. made up. by one
or two other banks. . In other .words, while
. there has been more or less shifting of funds
among the other Institutions;, their averages:
d.. not vary much- in tile aggregate from the
-y -previous week. .What has- thought about this
shewing cannot- be determined .accurately.- It"
Is known that the return of American. se'cUrl-
'. ties from Europe is responsible, for some - dif
ference In the totals. .Then, ' too;- the rapid '
*" formation of industrial -'..combinations is re-'
quiring some extensive financing. The = Stock
- Exchange transactions for the- week were very
Â« much under the enormous, dealings, of the pre
." vious fortnignt." and While .a. loan expansion
â¢ of some magnitude had been considered prob- '
able, the cash changes are disappointing- and
' confusing.' Still the idle surplus, of the -New
.York ' banks is above the; average- and there
â¢ is"no reason to anticipate that rates, will show
any change over the- cbmlng . week on. legitl-'
.â¢ mate business. There is .a â¢ -notable activity
'in commercial paper. at prevailing quotations*.
The banks, hdwever, are-- -Inclined to-discrim
inate against the wholesale offerings '.of indus
' trial collateral of uncertain Vaiue and are ex-,
ercising some caution in taking-lines that have
not- proved their Intrinsic value, through- actual
â¢ operation- ; Talk of concerted-. action In forming
"a common policy with reference, to these offer
ees' however, is not borne out- by facts, as
the banks will exercise their .Individual judg
ment in dealing with the matter/.

TO START A LOBSTER FARM.
Away down on the Maine coast at
Harpswell. a lobster farm is to be estab
lished by two enterprising men who have
made a study of lobster culture. The work
will be carried on according to scientific
directions from the United States Fish
Commissioners.
Lobsters have been very scarce along
the Maine coast for several yearsâ that 's
as compared with former periods. Good
sized lobsters used to be sold from the
cart for 5 cents apiece and. of course at
wholesale they went even cheaper. Many
people suppose that the smallness of the
lobster catch in Maine. is accounted for
by the existence of many canneries, but
this is not so. There have been no lob
ster canning factories in operation in
Maine since 1895, in which year a law was
passed forbidding the taking of lobsters
under I<H_ inches in length. This law
forced the canning companies out of busi
ness, as It was intended to.
The average annual catch of lobsters on
the Maine coast is about 7.500.000, esti
mated to be worth $750.000.â Fishing Ga

We -had "started with a large
-.party., but had .wandered' away.
The Indians surprised us. and we found
Yourselves at the top of a round hill and
Indians, were â¢at the bottom, and
: We knew- that they. would try either to
starve, vis "<Sut or -surprise us. The large
ypfertyy with -.whom* we had been travel
ing.were miners; on their way to the
Blade mils; The Indians' were angry
..because we' htvd come into their coun
try. Several miners had been killed by
them. We .kne /that. we would get no
mercy "if should- fall- into the Indi
ans-- 'clutches.
"It -was tail alizing, as we looked
\_.rbm'' the hill' upon" which we were pris

f oyer 'a hill â¢' tivir ' two miles away, their
hacks .'turned to . us, as.. we could see
through a- fleldgiass, Soon they would
be far away and we could not hope
to get .'any -help' from' them unless we
-.Quickly. We tried to attract
/their- attention by firing our rifles, but
they supposed, as. we learned later, that
we : were firing" at a bear, the tracks of
which they had noticed. The Indians
â wfe cried, us and also kept a sharp look
out 'upon out departing friends, but
. they . kept .under . coyer, : so that our
.friends should hot see them.

had given him; he made a "hook out of

fastened the hook to the ' rope and
threw the rope over the gate. Now -the

â¢'No one was sure that he had a gun
of such long range.
"Very well, then," said I, 'we will
have "to trust to 'old reliable' once
more."
"I loaded up my own rifle and rammed
an old-fashioned rifle with me on that
trip. There may be better guns, but I
have never seen one that would fire
farther and give so good an account of
itself. Unknown to the boys I wrapped
the letter that I had written about a
bullet and had put a thin wire around
the paper to hold it on. To get the
bullet into the barrel was a hard mat
ter. If the bullet mold had not turned
out a bullet a little under size I would
not have been able to make it go.
"Now wait," I said, "and see me shoot
one. of. our friends."
"You shall not do that," said Charlie,
earnestly.
. "I pushed Charlie aside and took
careful aim and fired at the proper
angle, to make the bullet carry as far
as possible. We kept a sharp watch
for the next few seconds. We could
see that there, was excitement among
our. friends. One. of them was pointing
the geese get a mouthful, so that they
cannot squawk, and then I will go over
into the garden."
From the satchel several wads . of
shoemaker's -wax were pulled out by
the Prince. On each of the wads the
Prince sprinkled some meal, that he
had taken from the mill. Shoemaker's
wax is very sticky. The geese eagerly
gobbled the wax, being attracted by the
smell and sight of the meal. The wax
stuck their jaws together so that they
could not open them to make a sound.
"This is the time for me," said the
Prince. He climbed up to the top of
the gate and slid down the rope to the
ground in . the garden. "Good geese,
what will you do if I will take the wax
out of your mouths?" asked the Prince.
Of course they could not answer, but
each goose solemnly put one foot upon
its heart, thereby promising friendship.
You may not have noticed this to be a
fact, but - so' it is; a goose -may -be
stupid, but no goose has ever been
known to- break a promise. The wax
was- taken from the jaws of the geese,

he was doing. "Keep your promises,"
said the" Prince, "and all will be well
with you.'*

some distance from the gate, when- a
raven called to him: "Lejundire, the

giant ran to the gate. There he found
the leather rope that had served the
Prince so well. "I will take this with
me," said the giant, "and when I catch
the Prince I will hang him to one of the
trees in the garden with his own rope."
Meanwhile the â  Prince, being thirsty,
was engaged in milking one of the cows
belonging to the giant. He made a cup
out of leaves and was enjoying a drink
of milk when something from overhead
seized him and held on so that he could
not pull away. He saw that he was in
the grasp of a raven. Lejundire. who
was not distant, hearing the noise,
came up. Once more the Prince was
in the power of a giant.
"At last," said Lejundire, "I have you
so that you can never get away.. I will
just put some of this magic fire paint
upon your fine coat and turn you loose
until 'sunset. Then the paint will take
fire and it will be good-by little Prince.

FOOL NO SUSIE
â¦ .. BY MARY ANDERSON. +
HARRY was bashful. . So, was
Susie. Harry wished to send a
valentine to Susie and wished
to make sure that she received
it He had a very large New
foundland dog who would carry
bundles and could be sent after a pack
age that he had seen his master day
down. Harry started out on St. Valen
tine's night with his dog, Verner, fol
lowing, and with his very best valen
tine tightly held. It had on it a picture
of a heart of- pure gold and some
winged Cupids and a lot of flowers On
the envelope was this: 'Miss Susie
Cross, from Harry." The valentine was
â  placed on the doorstep and Harry was
about to ring the bell when he heard
some one titter. He could not stand
being laughed at and he stepped back
into the darkness, much confused.
Who should come forward but Ned
Williams and Georgie Perkins! Ned
â¢was carrying a light stepladder and
Georgie had a string of jingling tin
cans, all of which were filled with
water. "Sh," said Georgie, as Ned
placed the stepladder against the door.
Rat-a-ta-tat. Ned was nailing some
thing to the door of Susie's home and
Georgie was filling a popgun with
water.
"TIM THE TERROR" AND. THE

the ladder away. - '_ ...
Georgie tapped on the door and steps

"There she comes." said Ned giggling.

not know what to do. Like mftny an
other, he made a mistake because he

burn when the sun went down. It yvas
so sticky that if the Prince tried to
climb over the gate' he would surely
stick fast. The paint burned even now,
and would grow hotter and more un
bearable every minute. Of course this
was the work of magic. But the Prince
did not try to run away. "Let us have
some, fun," he said to the giant, "to
pass the time. I hear that you are a
great wrestler. See If you can 'throw
me."
The giant laughed at this. The Prince
slily put his right hand into his satchel
and grasped the kindstone firmly/ The
stone was soft and crumbled | easily.
Having kindstoned both his hands the
Prince put himself in the way of the
laughing giant. The giant had to stoop
until he was nearly double to get hold
of the Prince. When I Don't Care was
in his gr:.sp he found to his surprise
that he could not stand up straight,
nor could he lift or harm the Prince.
On the contrary the Prince, to whom
the kindstone had given the strength
of one hundred men. was able, seizing
the giant by one of his huge legs, with
a swift turn, to throw ihe monster
squarely on his back upcflHta^pround.
"What truly wonderfui^^^-npth,"
said the astonished giant. m_g__ if I
only had you to chop wood forpW you
would be worth fifty servants, and you
would be cheaper, too, for you could not
eat much." .
This amused the Prince. "You ought
to have thought of that before you pre
pared to burn me up, Lejundire. It is
too late now. But I always have said
that you were stupid and now I know
it. But come, let us try some other
game. I believe that I can beat you
running."
--' The giant -agreed, to make the test.
- Away the two went over hill and
meadow. The giant was ahead at first,
but the Prince, stooping down, covered
his shoes with a coating rf the dust of
the kindstone. Then he flew like the
wind and easily caught up with the
giant and passed him. So they played
games all the afternoon.

said the Prince. "See. I know that I
am to die to be burned to death soonâ
and yet I can laugh and make sport
for you. Come with me and let us Â«"e
did not have the time he needed to
think before he acted. He did not wish
to have Susie think that he had put a
valentine on her doorstep ! so that she
might be soaked when she bent over to
pick it up. If Susie thought that she
would never forgive him.
"Go and get the letter Verner," he
said to the dog.
Verner darted forward. At that in
stant Susie opened the door and stood
on the doorstep.
Swish! The water from the popgun
struck her full in trie face.
Bow-wow! Verner ran against her
as he tried to. reach Harry's valentine
to pick it up.
Bang, bang! Swish, swish! Down
fell the cans of cold water, striking the
poor girl and drenching her clothing
thoroughly.
"Oh, oh," shrieked Susie.
"Ha, ha," laughed both of the bad

Susie was plucky. She stood her
ground until she had Harry's valentine
in her hand. She thought that she'
would now know who had played this
trick upon her. v When she read the
writing on the envelope she was quite
angry; nor would she speak to Harry
again for some time â until Ned and
Georgie owned up to her. â¢ Susie and

A league from the castle was a
swampy lake, in which lived a huge
water serpent that was so .large that
it could easily swallow. a whole ox. The
Prince led the way to the swamp, and
there told the giant what he was about
to do. . .'. Yyfy- .â  ' â

awaken the serpent. ' A minute later

call as if in great trouble. So she drop
ped her book and hastened to their
room to find Flora sitting up in bed
weeping softly, while Marian was hug
ging her and begging her to stop.
"What is the matter?"' asked their
mother, as she took Flora in her arms.
"Tell me, darling."
"Mamma, when I drow up, won't I be
your dirl?" As yet. Flora could not
manage her g's. Then there was an
other burst of tears.
"My darling, what put such an idea
into your head?"
"Won't I, mamma? Won't I?" was
sobbed.
"Of course, you will," said mamma, as
she hugged her tightly. "You will al
ways be my girl. But what does it
mean? Marian, have you and she been
talking together Instead of going to
> sleep?"
"No, mamma," answered Marian,
greatly distressed. "I have just been
lying here never saying a word, and
neither did she."
"Were you not talking when she be
gan to cry?"
"No, mamma. But I know how it
was. This morning, when we were at
Aunty's, Cousin Clara told her she
with shining green scales, and glided
madly about the water looking for the
person who had dared to disturb him,
the Prince ran nimbly toward the wa
ters' edge and threw a number of som
ersaults, revolving with great speed.
The serpent opened its mouth. So ex
actly had the Prince calculated that he
fell fairly spun â through the serpent's
rows of sharp teeth and down into the
monster's dark throat before the ser
pent, who was-Auch surprised, thought
to shut his mouth. The giant looked
on with great wonderment expressed
on his face. Suddenly the serpent be
gan to thrash the water violently and
to make a very loud barking noise, as
if in pain. The giant saw a sharp
steel point dividing the green scales
upon the serpent's body. Then the
hand of the Prince, and then his arm
and then his body came into view.
In among the reeds fell the Prince.
Diving deep, he came up near the shore
and ran up the bank to the giant.
; "Now it is your turn,' said the Prince,
"let us see how much better a giant can
do than a poor little fellow like me. I
am sure that you will make me quite
ashamed." - .
The giant had not expected. to see- the
Prince alive again. Big as he was, Le
jundire was afraid of the serpent. But
he could not allow the Prince to laugh
at him, for giants are very vain, and
so he said that he would now show the
Prince" a new trick .worth two of any
the Prince could perform". ' So saying,
would get married when she .grew up,
and so would have to. leave you.. Then
she began to cry and say she wouldn't.
And I just made Cousin Clara' stop iL.
And told Flora she needn't leave you
if she didn't want to. That's all."
"So you have been lying here going
over it, my Pettie?" asked- her. mother.
"Yes," murmured the little voice that"
could not manage the g's. -. -"'.' -y .

"And with papa, too?" asked the
faithful little soul. 'â¢.-"
"Yes," said papa, darting in from the
hall, where he had been listening.
"And now for a lark over It.''
And a lark there was, from which
papa came out with, a rumpled collar
and his hair flattened down on his fore
head so that his eyes could scarcely be
seen. As for Marian and Flora, they
got out of breath, were glad to lie
down and be cuddled by mamma. In
just half a minute more they were both
sound asleep. . ' ~ ELSA HUGG, 'â¢

the giant seized a long log, which he
sharpened at . both ends with his big
sword. The serpent, much enraged,
drew near. Skillfully Lejundire threw
the log so- that it stood on end* in the
serpent's mouth, wedging the jaws wide
open. The serpent, . in its struggles,
drove the points into its face, and could
no longer either open or close-its mouth.

he having smeared his good sword plen

shall not be reopened until further or
der from the Government. On the same
day the armed forces of the Govern
ment took possession of the court
house, tore down the notices of the
Chief Justice and put new locks on the
doors. The armed â¢ guard remained
watching the courthouse. Dr. Itaff el,
the President of the municipality un
der the Berlin treaty, then asserted
that, under the treaty, as there was a
vacancy in the office of Chief Justice,
he, the President, was acting Chief
Justice. In this he was strongly backed
up by the German Consul and German
The United States and British Consuls
and Captain Sturdee took quite another
view, and that was that under the
agreement with the Provisional Gov
ernment no official was to be disturbed,
and that this was a distinct breach of
that agreement. They further held that
there was no vacancy, as no authority
could dismiss the Chief Justice unless
the three powers; and in addition there
was no vacancy, in fact, as the Chief
Justice was in Samoa and claimed the
full possession of his rights. This was
communicated to Dr. Raffel and the
German Consul, but they declined to
give way, and reasserted their position.
Captain Sturdee then issued a public
notice that the Supreme Court had been
illegally closed, and that the Chief Jus
tice, supported by the U. S. A. Consul-
General and H. B. M. Consul, under the
protection of the armed forces of the
Porpoise, would hold a court at noon
on January 7, and that if resistance
were met, fire would be opened to sup
port the rights of Great Britain and the
United States. Notice was sent â¢ the
German Consul, the President and the
Provisional Government. The Provi
sional Government immediately with
drew the armed guard from the court
house, and, notwithstanding the pres
sure brought to bear upon them, and
the persuasive eloquence of Herr yon
Bulow and others, remained steadfast
in their decision and sent no force to
oppose the opening.
To try and persuade Mataafa to come
out of his shell and oppose the Porpoise,
the German â  Consul sent round on
horseback by German man-o'-warsmen
a notice in German that Captain Stur
dee had notified him he, intended to
shell Apia that forenoon, but as Cap
tain Sturdee had not said so he did not
do so. At noon the Chief Justice, sup
ported by the two Consuls, went to the
courthouse. An armed force of 25 from
the. Porpoise, under Lieutenant Parker,
halted a little way off. The President
and German Consul were found on the
courthouse veranda, and claimed that
the President was acting .Chief- Justice
in possession, that Chief Justice Cham
bers was no longer Chief Justice. Â»
Both made . violent and s heated
speeches, jto which Consul â¢ Maxse,*-,who
acted as spokesman .for^himself arid
the United States Consul, replied firm
ly and to the .point. He declined to
discuss the situation any longer. He
said he intended to open the court with
or . without ' force, 1 and â Â« that he and ' the
Porpoise .were at the disposal of his
Honor, the Chief Justice, N. S. . Cham
bers, Esq. ! Lieutenant Parker then
brought up hi% men alongside the court
building. The Chief Justice behaved
in a dignified manner, declining to lis
ten to either President or German Con
sul unless they addressed him as "your
Honor"; this they refused to do. After
more blustering ; and - a further formal
protest, the Germans withdrew just as
the clerk of the" court with one blow
of a sledge hammer sent the . door ;of
the courtroom wide open. With the
officials went all the German element,
.after giving three cheers : for Germans
or Germany, or anything anti-British
and American. The Chief Justice then
declared the court open, and issued a
decree dealing with the "unauthorized,'
unlawful and rebellious" action of the
Provisional Government in closing the
court. â¢ V ' '-..
Short addresses Were made by the
two supporting Consuls, and by the
members of the bar, the Samoan flag
was hoisted over the courthouse, sa
luted by the Porpoise guard, and the
I crowd dispersed with ringing cheers. In
: connection with the restoration of the
! court, the German captain was asked
to aid in the matter, but absolutely re
| fused. Later on the Chief Justice on
January 7 Issued a proclamation as
i sorting his rights and those of his
, courts, and a similar notice was pub
i lished by the American and English
I Consuls. After this matters quieted
downâ the Germans exulting in what
they call a diplomatic victory â
Britisher and true American feeling
that their national honor and flags have
been grossly insulted, although they
have not yielded one jot. ,
On Sunday, the Sth, In gross defiance
, of the terms arranged with the Pro
j visional Government, the head chiefs
I of the Malietoa party were deported to
â¢ Mauna, about 160 miles from Apia, and
j the minor chiefs to the regal Island of
j Manuono, the rank and file being al
. lowed to return to their homes upon
j payment. of small fines. This action of
j the Provisional Government has al
j ready had an effect upon Mataafa sup
| porters, and talk is rife that soon those
who think the defeated have not been
rightly dealt with will join forces with
them against Mataafa. - Vy..- ....:.

THE KENNEL CLUBS.
'Peace Declared Between Prominent
Organizationsâ May
Bench Show.
The- St. Bernard Club held an important
and well attended meeting on Monday
last. It was unanimously decided that
the club would "hang up" its most valua
ble specials for the spring bench . bhow,
and in token of the reconciliation with the
San Francisco Kennel Club, some of the
most Influential members will co-operate
with the latter' in the guarantee fund.
In addition to this, the complete harmony
that now reigns between the two principal
dog clubs on the Pacific Coast- will be
further emphasized by the advent of
some St. Bernard men into the kennel
club. Dr. W. R. Cluness Jr., who has al
ready made an honored scientific reputa
\ tion, has signified his intention of ap
plying for membership in the San Fran
; Cisco Kennel Club, and the directors of
the latter are emphatic in their j assur
i ance of the success of the application.
The proprietors of the Verona kennels
have been rather unfortunate of . late.
A fire broke out in the kitchen on Mon
day last and caused much damage, which,
however, was covered by insurance. The
fire originated in a defective flue.
â¢ Mr. de Ruyter has received a telegram
from Troy, N. V., to the effect that the
Verona kennels' English setter bitch
Gleam s Ruth, which was sent there to be
bred to Cincinnati's Pride, has arrived
safely.
A new competitor for fox terrier hon
ors will be shown in San Francisco in
May. Miss Edith Bull's Lancelot, bred
by George Francis out of Trlxle to Dan,
will. It Is expected, give the veteran? a
rattle ' for the money. Lancelot is a
long muzzled ratter, with a splendid body
and good markings. Miss Bull, who is
also the owner of the rough. coated St.
Bernard Beauty M, has re-fused several
liberal offers from local breeders, and is
sanguine that her terrier will show up
prominently in the ring.
The bench show committee of the San
Francisco Kennel Club has not been idle.
The Mechanics' Pavilion has been- hired
for the flrst week in May, the guarantee
! fund is progressing apace, and many
I valuable special ; prizes - have already
been promised. â  Messrs. Crocker, Spreck
els and De Ruyter have decided on offer
ing cups, and Herman Oelrlchs will oner
a number, of gold medals.
The Pacific y Mastiff Club holds its
monthly . meeting next H Saturday In , the
Phelan building, and : will decide on the
club specials. Â£ The I outlook for' a big and
sucqesful show 1 has never been so-satis
factory in the. history of the Pacific
