: :.â¢â¢ The Call prints this morning 1
â interviews with Republicans in
.â¢all parts of the State of Califor- !
nia in which they express their
â¢ -opinions regarding* the candidacy;
Of Colonel Daniel M. Burns for]
United States Senator. These
'.interviews are in response to in
structions wired to the cor
: respondents of The Call in nearly
.every town in the State asking
â  them to get signed statements
â¢ from prominent Republicans of
their vicinity.
â¢.â¢:; No attempt was made by The
./.Gall to bias these interviews, and
the correspondents were not in
structed to make a partisan can- 1
vass. It is a most significant
fact that notwithstanding these
.conditions the interviews re
ceived are almost unanimously
against the candidacy of Burns
tint more than a dozen out of the
: hundreds printed being* in the
â¢â  slightest degree in his favor.
â¢ These interviews are signifi
cant from another fact. The men
; who gave them could not find
terms too strong with which to
â  express their condemnation of
'.Sums and his candidacy, and
when they so expressed them
selves they did not hesitate to
place their signature to the ex
pression. It was the frank and
free expression of the desire of
the great body of Republicans of
California to the men who are
representing them in the State
Legislature, and the demand for
a clean man is given in no uncer
tain tone. It is a set of instruc
tions from the electors of the
State to the men whom they
: placed in position.
The Call has taken this means
of giving publicity to the voice of
the people because it had reason
to believe that the Senators and
Assemblymen at Sacramento
SANTA CLARA COUNTY'S PROTEST.
'..!â¢â  The following resolutions were passed yesterday by the
Republican Good Government League of Santa Clara Countyi
... Resolved, That it is our matured and deliber
ate opinion that the political character, reputa
tion and antecedents of Daniel M. Burns unfit and
disqualify him for the honorable position of United
â¢States Senator. ,
Resolved, That State Senators and Assem
blymen from the county of Santa Clara are earn
estly requested to use all honorable means to
prevent his election to such position. : 0.
The San Francisco Call.
I were receiving scores of letters
! daily calling upon them to vote
! against Burns and to vote for a
I clean man to represent the great
I State of. California in the upper
house of the Congress of the
United State's. The desire has
not been to make a partisan
showing, but to give opportunity
to the Republicans to state in a
most public manner their prefer
ence for the man who shall oc
cupy that exalted position. That
the interviews are so unani
mously against Burns is - . not .in
any sense of the word through
design on the part of The Call,
and this paper would have given
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JANUARY 8, IS99â THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
equal publicity ;to the interviews
had every -one of them been in
favor of Burns.
The voice of the people is
heard. If these interviews are
any criterion of the public pulse,
and they undoubtedly are, then
is there a single legislator at the
State capital who, can with hon
esty and. integrity to the interests
and desires of : his constituents
vote for the man who is so bit
terly and so publicly denounced?
' Is there the least doubt in the
mind of any legislator as to what
will be the result if he be recreant
to his trust?
With the demand for "a clean
man," "anybody but Burns," is
there a legislator who can vote
for Burns and feel that he has
carried out the desires of those
who sent him to Sacramento?
The interviews are from all
parts of the â from moun
| tain to sea, from State line to
; Mexico. All but a dozen con
demn the candidacy of an un
clean man. Let the men who will
cast their votes for Senator read
them and act accordingly.

CRY STOCKTON REPUBLICANS
STOCKTON, Jan. 7.â "My personal
preference Is General Barnes. His
brilliant attainments and loyal ser
vice to the party entitle him to the hon

presence in the United States Senate. I
have no animosity toward any of the
candidates, but we cannot afford to send

Barnes, nor can any Republican remem

JULIUS COHNâ "I am for Dan Burns.
Why? Because I think he has earned the
office. But I; think he will make only a

THE STATE CONDEMNS BURNS.
From nearly every city, town and hamlet in the State comes a protest
from leading Republicans against the election of Daniel M. Burns to succeed
Senator White.
These expressions are so strong that to disregard them would mean
the political death of any Assemblyman or State Senator, as those uttering
them are the men who have most to do with shaping political affairs in their
neighborhoods.
The Call has obtained these expressions of public opinion because it
believed that the issue was so important that the people should be heard.
Out of the thousands of good Republicans interviewed, but eight or ten have
shown any favor . to. the man whose unscrupulous methods and unsavory
record would make his .election a disgrace to the State and a shame to the
party. ;'... :
General Barnes is large enough to fill
it." '

"As the situation now stands I believe
General W. H. L. Barnes should be the

AGAINST DAN M. BURNS
CHICO, Jan. 6.â BEN F. ALLEN: "I
am not in favor of the election of a man
Of Burns' character, and think it a dis
grace to the party to forward a man of
his type. If he had his just deserts he
would be now in the State's Prison in
stead of trying for office."
GEORGE MILLER-"The Legislature
does not dare elect a man like Burns. The
members would not dare to return to
their respective homes if they voted for
him. The people are universally against
his election, and I think the members w...
look to their constituents for advice be
fore voting."
DR. N. WATTSâ "It would be a dis
grace for any party for its members to
support Dan- Burns,, with the record he
carries. He might be a smart man and
all that, but he Is not honest, and none
but honest men should be supported.
There are many honorable men in the
party who are worthy of the place who
have lived honest and straight lives, and
I think as a Republican no man of Burns'
record should receive the best office at the
hands of a party which he has dis
graced."

to-day."-JOHN R. NEWBERRY.

LEY.
"The Republican party of this county
has Indorsed Mr. Bulla for Senator and

SAY SANTA ROSA VOTERS
SANTA ROSA, Jan. &-JAY WILLIAM
HUDSONâ "UntiI the record of Colonel
Burns has been thoroughly Investigat
ed and authoritatively given the public
I can say nothing, concerning him as a
man, but with California's brilliant sons
available with no stigma of scandal, with
no reproach of political chicanery to
sully reputation, I remonstrate with all
my being against his representing me as
a citizen in the United States Senate."
C. A. -WRIGHT, Stationerâ "l don't
think a man of Burns' reputation should
be elected to fill such an Important office
vii'i'iiiy
or the-
CH_.&r.FUL CÂ°UNT&NAWCI

Grant is the man for the place."

favor Grant."

think Mr. Burns a man-perfectly capable
of representing the people In the position
of United States Senator, but do not be
lieve he Is the man the people want to

count of the fact that they lack confi
dence in him."

acquainted with . Mr. Burns, all the
knowledge of the man having been gained
through newspapers. Judging him by
his newspaper reputation I should not
think him the proper man for the place."
E. D. SWEETSER, Editor Sonoma
County Farmerâ "l think we should elect
a man for United States Senator who is
entirely above suspicion, and for that
reason am against Dan Burns. If the
matter were to be settled by popular vote
would vote against him. I favor a man
from the south to replace White."
SUPERVISOR T. <'. PUTNAMâ "Of all
the candidates so far mentioned, I con
sider Burns least suitable. The position
should be filled by an entirely different
kind of a man. Of those out I favor
Barnes, but Scott is mv favorite."
H. G. HAHMAN, Booksellerâ "I am not
personally acquainted with Burns or
Grant, but from general knowledge the
former does not seem to me the kind of
man for the high position of Senator
Judging from what the papers have said'
1 do not think he would be acceptable to
the people of the State."

man for the place, and I am against him
first, last and all the time. He is not a
suitable man under any circumstances."

Utatlon and honor to fill It."
DR. C. H. THOMPSON-"If the Legis
latum of this State elects Dan Burns
United States Senator I say the quicker
the Senator Is elected by the direct vote

from being slmillarly disgraced In fu
ture.
B M. SPENCER-"California has sev
eral times in its history occupied the po
sition where the honoring of a man who
had forced himself into public prominence
would be a public calamity. But the
worst thing that could happen or could

EUREKA, Cal.. Jan. 7.-"I believe that

the Republicans for at least two of the
following elections. I believe that fully
nine-tenths of the people of Humboldt
County are opposed to the election of
Burns."â E. E. SKINNER.
"Am positive that the election of Burns
would surely defeat the Republican party
in 1900. We could never remove the stain
of such a choice from California's fair
name. Knight, Barnes or Giilett would be
an honor to the party and to the State."â
W. E. COOK.
"I am against Dan Burns first, last and
all the time. If a member of the Legisla

Western country, even to the candldacy

machine politics. I cannot believe it pos- !
JULIUS JANSEN.
"I am not in favor of Burns for Senator.

this State if he is elected. In fact, It !
would be a calamity. The Republican

he ran the party four years ago."â W.
HENDERSON, President Humboldt |
County Bank.
"The election of Dan Burns to the
United States Senate would be an out- |
rage, the like of which never was perpe

MARYSVILLE, Jan. 7.-T. J. SHER
WOOD: "As the contest for Senator now
stands, which seems to be a choice be
tween Burns and Grant, I am decidedly
in favor of the former. In point of abil
ity and because of past services in be
half of his party Colonel Burns should
succeed as against Grant. The contest
has taken the form of one Senator trying
to dictate to the people of the State as
to who shall be his colleague to succeed
Senator White, which Is sufficient reason
of itself to defeat Grant at this time.
R. E. BEVAN. Sheriff: "Irving M.
Scott has been my choice all the way

for California than any other candidate."
J. A. MABEN, City Marshal: "I prefer

selection for the office, I think Mr. de
Young would do more for the State than,
any candidate mentioneu."
HENRY GOODCELL, Attorney â
"Burns is too closely identified with ma
chine politics and corporation influence
to meet the requirements of the office.
His election would he regarded as a vic
tory of bos.- and railroad Influence',
and would react disastrously upon the
Republican party."
J. W. NELSON, President of Oakland
Expositionâ "l regard Burns as morally

Barnes, M. M. Estee or W. R. Davis
would be my choice."
REV. C. H. HOBARTâ "We cannot af

and machine politician such as Burns to
represent us in the important office of
Senator." â¢â¢:<ââ¢
JAMES S. NAISMITH, Real Estateâ
"Burns is too closely allied to that ele
ment that believes In running politics
without regard to the welfare of the
State, but solely for revenue onlyâ
what they can make."
J. B. RICHARDSON, Attorneyâ "l con
sider Burns the most unfit of any of thos_
named for office. My preference Is M. M.
Estee." Ji
JOHN T. BELL, Director Oakland Ex

is an Insult to the people of this State."
WILLIAM LAIR HILL, Attorneyâ "l
believe the election of Burns would not
satisfy the people of California, and it
would be unfortunate for the party in
power. No man can truly represent Cal
ifornia In the Senate who is not above
suspicion and free from obligation to the
corporations for assisting his election."
ELBERT R. DILLE, D.D.â "Of all the
men who have been mentioned for Sena
tor I consider Burns the most unfit. If :
California wants to show that she' has
passed out of the conditions of a frontier
camp into those of a settled civilization
and to repel the accusation of abnormal
and low moral standard, let her not send
a low and corrupt politician like Burns
to the chief council of the nation."
L. G. BURPEE, Cashier First National

R. H. CHAMBERLAIN. Merchantâ "l

health and strength to the feminine organ-

and capacity to the bodily powers but has
also given renewed brightness and buoy-

" I suffered for over a year." says Mrs. Williams,
" with indigestion and nervous prostration. I

FAILED WITH
MORRIS BROOKE
Contest Against the Assemblyman
'â¢â¢â¢â¢;â¢ Withdrawn Without Apparent
Cause.
This Sudden End to the Matter Created Great
Surprise â The Man From Mexico Now
Has Another Implacable Foe,
.'CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 7.â Assemblyman Morfis
. Brooke of Sacramento will be allowed
to' cast his vote for United States Sen
ator according to the dictates of l-iis
ow_ conscience.
That he will is not the fault of Dan
B_r_s, the Mexican candidate, and the
odorous gang of peons who are up here
working in his rests. Th- scheme
,cf bribery and intimidation hatched by
the crowd for the purpose of gaining
â¢ Brooke's vote has been dissipated un
der the limelight cast upon it by The
Call of Friday morning. Their brazen
attempt, fostered and betted by Her
rin's hirelings, and apparently aided
by County Clerk Hamilton, to whip
Brooke into line with the Burns forces
by threatening his seat in the Assem
bly, has fallen flat, and this afternoon
â¢ old ex-Senator Johnston withdrew the
contest which he filed against Brooke
at the instigation of the Alcalde and his
â¢ political employes. No reason was
â vouchsafed for the -withdrawal.
'. The sudden end to the contest, though
' foreshadowed in The Call, has created
' surprise among the many who have
been on the inside and carefully watch
ing the progress of the case. It was
â¢ only yesterday that the aged ex-Sen
ator m-ade public the statement that
â¢despite the allegations of this paper he
'.had never for a moment thought of
â¢ abandoning his case and would not do
â¢ so- until it had been decided either for
;or against him. He also denied posi
tively that his suit against Brooke had
been Incited by Burns or his in
terests, notwithstanding the statement
â¢of Brooke himself that he had been
â¢promised a position for the next four
. years under County Clerk Hamilton in
return for his vote and threatened with
,a decision against him in this suit if he
'.'â¢declined. Notwithstanding, also, the
further statement of Brooke that when
';'he had called upon Johnston to know if
.the' contest would be dismissed in case
he' voted for Burns the old gentleman
replied without equivocation that it
. Would.
. That ex-Senator Johnston has been
made the tool of the politician Burns
is evident in the light of his positive
public statements and his contrary ac
tion. That the threat of Burns and the
â  contest itself were only the same old
..hard- worked Burns bluff is even more j
palpable. Assemblyman Brooke is con
fident that the suit brought by John- !
ston was not conceived in good faith!
; ror prosecuted with any intention of al
lowing a' decision to be rendered, either !
for or against him. In fact, th- case
never has been prosecuted as it was
called the first time in the courts this
morning, and this morning also it was
dismissed. The publicity given it has
arisen out of no legal action, but wholly
out of the threats, cajoleries and en
treaties, that have been carried to
Brooke *Â»v the innumerable henchmen
of th Alcalde. It was set up as a man
of straw, and it has gone to pieces
without accomplishing anything in the
way of a stampede.
The only thing it has accomplished is
that it has shown in still another Diace
the hand of Herrin in another phase of ;
Burns' fight and roved that no culd I
.or crank in the present fight Is too
small or of too little importance fori
that High Chief Bungler of the South- .
crn Pacific to Interest himself in. with j
all the power behind him. It proves as j
well the frantic fight that Dan Burns |
has been reduced to in his last attempt
â to round up his fleeing prospects. Coun
ty. Clerk Hamilton and his connection
with the railroad it has left a? a aues
' tion for that official's constituents to
settle for themselves.

I if he would consent to tie himself up on
'- the Senatorial question. J. B. Wright
' j of the Southern Pacific, he was told,
' i had been promised a position in the
| Clerk's office which was still it his
: disposal and this position Brooke
. ! should have if he would bind the agree
, j ment. He was assured that Wright
. ; would see him through and that Hamil
'â  ; ton would stand for it. He took the
j proposition under consideration md no
' further connection of Hamilton with
; the case came to light until yesterday,
- i when evidence connected with him
j proved conclusively that the contest
; against Brooke was not a bona fide
proposition and never had been.
When Elwood Bruner, as attorney for
'. Johnston, appeared before Justices
Merkeley and Henry- to withdraw th.
[ contest, he was told that a motion for
; withdrawal was not necessary, as
: neither of the Justices had ever been
: commissioned by County Clerk Hamil
; ton to take evidence in the case.
The law governing election contests
! provides that two Justices of the Peace
! shall be duly commissioned by the
! County Clerk to take evidence, the cvi
! dence to be afterward transmitted to
! the Clerk and by him given into the
hands of either the Assembly or Sen
; ate. whichever house the contested seat
I be in.
Clerk Hamilton notified the two Jus
: tices that the case would come before
j them, but did not give them their com-'
| missions. When asked for them he put
i the matter off and intimated that they
; were really not necessary and that the
I case might proceed without 'hem until
!he had more time. When asked by a
; newspaper man why he had not issued
j them he said positively that he had.
i but this claim was proved false by the
i combined denials or* Justices Henry and
\ __er_<
Finally the court gave up looking for
> its commissions and decided to do pre
j cisely what Burn? and his gang hoped
'it would do: Take the evidence with
i out being duly commissioned, begin a
! bogus proceeding which wool : have the
j effect of still further intimidating
j Broo_e. but which, if their crookedness
j ever came to investigation, could not
j be used against them because of its
1 illegality. This morning was set as the
! day for taking testimony and both
j parties to the suit were notified. - ssem
; blyman Brooke subpenaed over a score
i of wl.nesses, prepared to fight the com-
I blna* against him to a finish.
Then came The Call's expose of the
j whole crooked scheme with ail its
j ramifications and the gang lost no time j
-in getting out from under by issuing
I orders to Mr. Johnston to have the
j suit killed. A further evidence of the
I bad faith in which the contest was
j brought is the course taken by the
; plaintiff himself. When he was asked
j for a list of the witnesses he wanted
: subpenaed he refused to give one and
â  when asked how he proposed to con
duct his case without them he replied
that he would ... verbally and
they would be on hand when wanted.
None of them were ever heard of and
none of them turned up to-day when
[ the case was called in Justice Henry's
court. Brooke's witnesses, ever,
! did turn up and just now they are out
looking for their fees The court as
sessed their charges to neither party
|to the suit. A number of them traveled
i over roads knee-deep in mud for twenty
I or thirty : dies and left their employ
i ment in order to be on hand. They all
j feel that they are entitled to compensa
i tion and are looking to Johnston for it.
j Johnston, however, quietly left town
| last night for his Richland ranch and
| failed to turn up to-day when called
for. Assemblyman Brooke proposes to
see 'hat his witnesses get their money
if he has to pay it himself and sue
: Johnston for reimbursement. Mean

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â A1l day there has
been a drizzling rain, which is good for
farmers, but makes the race of nature
look as though slapped with a dishrag.
It may be a rain full of golden prom
ise, but the immediate effect is de
pressing. It drives statesmen to cover,
and some of them, in view of the ill
effects of the dampness, It has driven to
drink. However, sobriety is the ruin:,
because a goodly proportion of the
crowd has no capital but hope and can
partake only when invited. This, of
course, includes those who came here
in quest of jobs. The men touting for
candidates appear to be supplied with
funds. Possibly these funds represent
the Federal salaries many of them
draw.
While Barnes and Knight have gone
home, and members of the Legislature
bearded outgoing trains, there will be
many outsiders in th. city over Sun
day. From inquiries delicately put I
learn that this will not augment ap
preciably the congregations in the local
churches. The skirmish Cor votes will
go right on. It is remarkable how
easily fooled some of the enthusiasts
are. There are names shown by follow
ers of each candidate as those members
certain to vote for their man. This in
dicates a multitude of second-rate
prophets, but it also tends to prove
that the prevalence c-f bribery may
have been exaggerated. Certainly if a
man were purchased the purchaser
would know it, and when there are half
a dozen claiming to have his support
the inference is fair that they do not
know what they are talking about.
To write a dally letter trom here is
not an unmixed joy. Naturally such a
letter contains an expression of opin
ion, and up to date it has not pleased
anybody, at least nobody has taken the
trouble to say so. Those in whose fa
vor the opinion happens to be kick be
cause I have not made it stronger, and
those whom it touches <-n the raw spot
declare that it is all wrong. In country
stores there used to be displayed a le
gend: "Our aim is to please." I have
no similar aim so far as any of these
politicians is concerned. If they do not
like the stuff the blessed privilege of
not reading it is one which cannot be
taken away, and. while I may be mis
taken, most of them are, too. I make
no pretense of liking the average poli
tician, and don't want him to like me.
He is in dirty business. There are ex
ceptions. There are men who seek of
fice and are worthy of it.
The chances of Burns have not
brightened since the Governor Injured
them through the assertion that any
one voting for Grant would affront the
executive, this meaning that any vote
not given to Burns would subject the
voter to any indignity Gage can put
upon him. This position excited amaze
ment and indignation which have not
passed away. There appears no pre
cedent for such a piece of arrogance.
If the Burns people realize that their
friend Gage has given them a swipe
they still maintain a bold front and
count votes which they will never be
able to count after the balloting has
! begun.
The Federal brigade has mostly gone
to â be city, thus indicating that the ,
loaves and fish linger at the bay. I '
believe these patriots might as well
stay there, for the nerve of -.hem has
not soothed the savage breast of the
country member, and the fact is be- i
â  ginning to be understood that for a' !
man to declare for Burns is to thrust
himself into suspicion. I met one Burns '
follower to-day who pointed with pride i
to the certainty of fifty-seven votes on
the first ballot, and yet none of the
other side seemed to view this with
alarm. On the contrary, they informed
the gentleman that he had reached the !
condition of seeing more than double.
While there could not be a quieter
[ fight than that of the Bums people, â 
! there could ..ot be one more desperate,
every art of intimidation, every promise ;
! being brought to bear. Some of the
cappers for the colonel's game are of
' a sort to Inspire the Sacramento police
with an idea of the necessity for sleep- ;
ing with one eye open. The very cir
cumstance of these rounders being In ;

SAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 7.â J. B.
FRITH. President City Trustees: "I am
afraid Bums will be elected. If he Is it
.will be a shame and a disgrace to the
send the whole camp to quarantine. I
can get no tip which leads me to be
lieve George Knight has any more show
of becoming Senator than he has of be
coming a white-winged angel, keeping
time to celestial songs on a golden
harp. General Barnes, whom everybody
likes personally, has a similar chance.
Several times there has been mention
of the Botkln trial and the Rosser trial.
Both are regarded as having injured '
the attorneys. It is thought t_e woman
was not well defended and that the man
was defended too well. Waymire has
been mentioned and came up to listen
to the music of his name, but the
strains were spasmodic and never
reached the dignity of a chorus. Bulla
keeps up his banner and his courage,
but he has a prospect of making a re
spectable temporary showing, and
there are others mentioned for the sake
of the pleasing thrill it causes them.
In my judgment the fight is between
Burns and Grant, and Burns, relying on
corruption and a bad record, with the
support of his man Gage, cannot win.
If he could the Republican party would
be wise to disband.
Grant is quietly confident. His rooms
are open to all. and there are many
callers coming in to make known their
sympathy and tender their votes.
Grant has been termed a carpet-bagger
which he isn't, and at the worst the
charge is not serious. Were I in his
place I would rather be called a carpet
bagger by the Burns gang than not. The
South has a way of pulling tog-.-'
If able to elect a man like Gage, who
is a nonentity, they will be able to elect
a better man. It is stated that if Burns
finds he cannot win he will throw his
strength to a cadidate of the North,
but there Is some question as to the
amount of strength he will have to
throw. It would be as wise to elect
Burns as any man whom he might name,
for such a man would only do his bid
ding, being in the abject predicament
of the dog eating crumbs from the rich
. man's table. Such a dog might yelp if
kicked but to bite would be ingratitude
, most base.
To-day the Examiner has its head
in the sand and its nether and most
impressive end skyward. It says the
Republicans ought to elect Pardee. It
says this to disguise the fact that it is
doing all it can to help Burns. I have
not yet run across anybody in the least
measure fooled by its posture. The
Poet's modest indorsement of Burns
creates no furor. There has been men
tion heretofore that the relations be
tween the Post and 'he railroad are not
unfriendly. Indeed, it has at times given
> Indications of an actual affection for
; the corporation, much like the affection
of serf for master. The railroad also
< wants Burns. I would like to see a
copy of the Post a few days after the
editor had bucked against an order
from the yellow building. But it made
a mistake In picturing Dan with a key
;in his hand. His relations with keys
have not always been pleasant, for
sometimes the other man held the key
j and Dan was on the wrong side of the
; door. This little matter of history would
Ibe allowed to rest except that Dan
: hopped into the arena and invited the
; turning on of the calcium light.
Those who may have followed these
letters will understand that they em
body personal sentiments and prophecy
based on individual judgment. Often
they do not dovetail with opinions ex
pressed elsewhere in the paper and I
anticipate great joy in crowing over
fellow tollers in the vineyard a little
later. The reason I predict the election
of Grant is that he is. with the excep
tion of Burns, the only man with a
definite following, that he has no tar
nished record, no shady chapters, has
never fled from the jurisdiction of a
government. He is genial, in the
prime of life, bears an honored name,
and does not. so far as I can ascertain,
have a lot of scalawags in his train,
nor the use of the powers of a State
Central Committee for boosting while
pretending to transact business for the
party. Moreover, he is commended by
the fact of having the active hostility
of Gage. I do not believe in abuse. The
plain truth about the Burns crowd may
at times seem to resemble abuse, but
this is no reason for not setting it
forth as It appears. At any time there
Is anything to convince me that Burns
has the much-vaunted cinch. I will say
so with entire frankness.
State. I think Burns a smart man. but
fear in this case he would be too smart.
In addition to the use of all honest
means he would use any dishonest means
to get the place and defeat an honest
man. I hope Grant will get there, but
fear the Influence of Burns."

AGUINALDO
ONCE MORE
TURNS UGLY
Puts Placards Against
Otis on Dead Walls at
Manila. ,
Togallo Leader Says He Never
Made Any Agreement to Sub=
mit to American Rule,
i-pecial Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Jan. 7.â Within a
few hours of the proclamation is
sued by Major General Otis in
.behalf of President McKinley the
agents of Aguinaldo billed Man
ila with a manifesto which at
tracted considerable attention.
The revolutionary President pro
tested against General Otis sign
ing himself Military Governor of
the Philippine Islands.
Aguinaldo, in his manifesto,
declared he had never agreed at
Singapore, Hongkong or else
where to recognize the sover
eignty of Americans here, and in
sists that he returned to the Phil-
â  "-'. â â â 'â '. re.' . . . .
. ippines on an American ship
solely to conquer the Spaniards
and win independence. He as
serts that both his proclamations
â¢of May 24 and June 12 stated this
fact officially, and he claims Ma
. jor General Merritt confirmed
this by a proclamation several
'days before the Spaniards capitu
lated, stating clearly and defin
itely that the American forces
came to overthrow the Spanish
Government and liberate the Fil
ipinos.
In conclusion Aguinaldo de
clared that he had natives and
foreigners as witnesses that the
American forces recognized, not ;
only by acts, that the Filipinos
â  "were belligerents, but by publicly
â¢saluting the Filipino flag "as it
â¢triumphantly sailed to the skies
before the eyes of all nations.''
Aguirtaldo then solemnly pro
tested in the name of the 'Deity,
who is empowered to direct his
brethren in the difficult task of
regeneration, against the intru
sion of the American Govern
ment, and reiterated that he
could produce proofs that he was
brought here on the understand
ing that the Americans promised
him their co-operation to attain
independence.
The revolutionary leader then
called upon all his followers to
work together with force, and
assured them that he is con
vinced that they will obtain;
absolute independence, urging 1
them never to turn "from the
glorious road on which they have
already so far advanced."
Major General Otis attaches
no importance to the manifesto.
'He says he feels confident that
the opinion of the better classes
.of the Filipinos is not expressed
â¢ in it. but as to whether the Fil
ipino masses can be controlled
and the Filipino army kept in
.Check he does not know, al
though he hopes for a pacific out

AMERICAN CONSULS
ARE IN HOT WATER
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â Washington special to the Herald says:
By the confirmation of the nomination of R. A. Mosely Jr. of Alabama
as Consul General at Singapore the Senate has caused the retirement
from the consular service of E. Spencer Pratt, also of Alabama.
While it is said at the State Department that Mr. Pratt's retire
ment is due to the fact that the President some time ago promised
the position to Mr. Mosely, it is no secret that the Senate has received
from Secretary Hay, through the State Department, communications
from the retiring Consul showing that he had been injudicious in his
relations with Aguinaldo and the Philippine junta at Singapore.
Consul Pratt, in fact, is accused by all Europeans along the coast
from Singapore to Yokohama of having been the veritable sponsor of
Aguinaldo and his pretensions. There are rumors, also, that Wildman
and Williams are in trouble on the same account.

AMERICAN SOLDIERS
FOR THE PHILIPPINES
PITTSBURG, Jan. 7.â Major General
Henry W. Lawton, who commanded a
division of the Fifth Army Corps during
the Santiago campaign, passed through
Pittsburg to-day from Washington on
his way to Columbus, Ohio, where he
will make an Inspection of the soldiers
in the barracks at that place. He will
also visit and make a careful inspection
of the physical condition and the char
acter of the troops now stationed at the
several forts and barracks, prepara
tory to sailing for Manila. As to the
reason for taking these precautions
and making a personal inquiry into the
condition of the troops, General Law
ton said:
"The trip is too long and too great
for any others than those in the very
best physical condition."
General Lawton will sail from New-
York January 15 on the transport Mo
hawk.
When asked about his trip to the
Philippines and preparations that
would be made before sailing the gen
eral said: "The first troop to sail for
these islands will be the Fourth Regi
ment, now at Fort Sheridan, Chicago,
and part of the Seventeenth, now at
Columbus barracks. I mean to take
none but the very best soldiers in our
army. This will be the first time in the
history of this country that a body of
soldiers of the United States army has
crossed the Atlantic Ocean. The whole
number assigned to the islands will not
be taken at one time. The trip will be
made through the Suez canal, and as
We will 'stop at a number of coaling
stations and ports foreign countries to
the east will have a first opportunity
of seeing what United States soldiers
look like."
General Lawton administered a
scathing rebuke to the people of this
country who disapproved of the policy
of enlarging the army. He said:
"There will be 30,000 soldiers sent to
the Philippines and that many to Cuba;
and then, besides, there will have to be
a large number sent to Hawaii and
Porto Rico. There is only one thing
evidentâ we will just have to enlarge
the standing army.
"At the present time, and for many
months to follow, United States trans
ports will encircle the globe. They will
be carrying volunteers back to their
homes and taking the regulars to re
place them."
LEO WILL SEND
KEANE TO MANILA
NEW YORK, Jan. Advices just
received from Rome confirm the news
that Archbishop Keane, formerly rec
tor of the Catholic University at Wash
ington, has been chosen by the Pope
to be Papal Nuncio to the Philippines,
as was exclusively foreshadowed in the
Herald a short time ago. Since his
residence in Rome Monslgnor Keane
has been in the high councils of the
church, his especial mission being to
look after the interests of the church
in America. That he is in unusual fa
vor with Pope Leo XIII is shown by
this extract from a letter just re
ceived:
"Alone among the archbishops resi
dent in the Curia Monslgnor Keane,
Archbishop of Damascus, enjoys the
favor of regular annual audiences with
his. Holiness the Po-pe.
"His Grace had one recently. It was
most affectionate, the Pope treating his
Grace with particular affection, said
that he had heard great praise of his
work of preaching in Rome, emphasized
its importance, and, while blessing him
in particular, blessed his hearers also."
The church of San Silvestro', where
Archbishop Keane preaches, is reported
to be crowded every Sunday, and he Is
considered one of the most popular
preachers in the Eternal City.
It is supposed by his friends here that
Archbishop Keane will accept the of
fice of Papal Nuncio to the Philippines,
although it will involve a sacrifice of
no. mean proportions, for the post is
not looked upon as one to be desired.
GERMAN NEUTRALITY
IN THE PHILIPPINES
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â The New
York Staats Zeitung will publish to
morrow the following from Its Berlin
special cable correspondent:
"I am informed from an unquestion

able source that after the surrender of
Iloilo the Spanish general tried to in
duce the German Consul at Manila and
the German Vice Consul ' at Iloilo to
take charge of the protection of the
private Interests of the Spaniards. The
two Consuls wired to Berlin for instruc
tions and received the following an
swer: 'The German empire, being a
neutral power, is not in a position to
take charge of functions which could
easily be construed as partiality to
Spain. All we endeavor to obtain in
the Philippines is protection and unre
stricted movement of our commerce.
Since we see that both are secured un
der the United States flag we are fully
confident that there will never arise
a situation which could cause us to
deviate from the strictly neutral atti
tude observed by, us up to this day.' '*
The correspondent adds that the
Washington Government has been in
formed of this declaration.
TWENTY MILLIONS
FOR THE SPANIARDS
WASHINGTON, Jan. The pay
ment of $20,000,000 to Spain under the
terms of the peace treaty Is beginning
to receive attention from members of
the House Committee on Appropria
tions, and it is likely that the amount
will be carried in one of the regular
appropriation bills, probably the sun
dry civil bill. Chairman Cannon says,
however, that the question has not been
formally considered yet, as there has
been no estimate presented and- no offi
cial information on the requirements of
the case. Moreover, there is no desire
to anticipate action on the treaty, and
unless it is ratified the House is hardly
in a position to carry out this provision
[as to payment. In the event of ratifi
cation, however, speedy action will be
necessary.
t^ reat Provides that the payment
shall be made within three months
after the exchange of ratifications,"
and another provision requires the ex
change of ratifications within six
m*mths from the date the treaty was
signed, viz., December 10 last. This
would bring the payment before the
next session of Congress, so that the
appropriation must be made at the
present session,
Owing to the short time elapsing after
the Senate acts on the treaty and the
close of the present session it is thought
that little time will remain to deal with
a matter of this magnitude. There has ,
been some talk of dealing with the pay
ment in a special appropriation, but i
this is not feasible, as a special bill has i
no privilege . under the rules and is!
easily open to obstruction, whereas the
general appropriation bills carry un
usual privileges and are almost certain
to pass before the session ends. For
this reason it is probable that the pay
ment will be placed in the sundry civil
or some other general appropriation
bill, if the provision is retained in the
treaty as ratified.
: The Appropriation Committee has not
determined what appropriation bill to
take up next. It will be either the sun
dry civil or the fortification bill, but
in any event the Spanish item is likely
to be deferred until action on the treaty
is secured.
EDMUNDS' VIEWS AS
TO THE PHILIPPINES
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â Ex-Senator
George F. Edmunds, in a letter ad
dressed to the New York World, re
views the Philippine question at
length. He describes briefly the phy
sical aspects of the islands and the
character of their inhabitants. The
population, he says, is "already denser,
than that of the State of Michigan,"
and adds that "of the total of all this
conglomeration of races, the Europeans
and Americans compose less than 2 per
cent, after more than 200 years of Eu
ropean occupation." He claims that
the people "never have been and never
can be in need of or consumers of
American productions to an appreciable
extent."
Dewey's victory, which "astonished
the naval powers of the world," gave
us control only of the bay and city of
Manila and its environments. Nearly
all beyond that was in possession of an
organized rebellion against Spain. But,
the people of the islands, who were car
rying on the rebellion in order to be
free and independent, do not desire to
be annexed and that they intend to re
sist annexation," Mr. Edmunds says,
"appears to be indisputable."
He then proceeds to show what a war
of conquest would mean, and asks how
we can be justified "in forcing by the
sword our particular and excellent Idea
of government, morality and religion
upon these people, as Mohammed did
in his religious wars and as Spain did
in her early operations on this con
tinent."
As to the status of the Fillipinos, Mr.
Edmunds argues that all of them who
were the subjects of Spain "will become
citizens of the United States by the
mere act of cession," and as such
they will "have all the rights that be
long to other citizens in the territories."
Edmunds says that "Congress can
not therefore lawfully prevent the mi
gration of any citizen residing in the
Philippines to our States any more
than it can lawfully prevent the migra
tion of the citizens of the States to the
Philippines."
What the Philippines will do to us in
cost, loss of lives, the introduction of
militaiism, etc., Edmunds considers a
serious aspect of the question. He as
serts the complete power of the Senate
over the treaty, to amend or reject, and
suggests that It may so amend it "as
to provide substantially, as the scheme
has been as to Cuba, that the people
of those islands should be left to gov
ern themselves."
As to the payment of $20,000,000 for
territory which Spain did not control,
Edmunds says that "in view of the
gravity of other aspects of the subject
it Is not worthy of notice."

MARIE BARNA TO SING AT
THE BEYREUTH FESTIVAL
San Francisco Girl Selected by Mme. Richard

Roles.
MARIE BARNA.
JsTEW YORK, Jan. 7.â Miss Marie Barna of San Francisco has
been selected by Mme. Richard Wagner to sing leading roles
at the Beyreuth festival next summer. Miss Barna had a highly
successful season at the Royal Opera of Saxe-Coburg last year
and had been engaged for next season.
General May la Rodriguez, commander
of Matanzas province, and General
Menocal, commander of Havana prov
ince, were not present.
A document was drawn up for dis
patch to General Rodriguez asking
him to call a general meeting of offi
cers to take action, first upon the need
of a sum of money to enable the officers
and privates of the army to make a
new start in life, and secondly, with re
gard to the lack of respect shown to
the Cuban . officers by the â¢ people of
Cuba and the Americans. The latter
matter has special reference to the re
fusal of the municipal police to salute
General Sanguilly and other officers.
The meeting to-day resulted in a
three hours' talk, critical, but not un
friendly to the Americans, and no dis
position was shown to assume an at
titude of protest or opposition. On the
contrary, a willingness to disband was
expressed, provided money was forth
coming to give the men composing the
Cuban army a new start. As one of
those present put the case: "As the
United States collects the island's reve
nues, we must look to the United
States."

Representative Loud Protests Against
the Maintenance of the Seattle
Assay Office.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. Repre
sentative Loud made a short and sharp
speech 'in the House this afternoon
against the proposition to make an appro
priation for the assay office at Seattle.
The House was discussing the regular ap
priatlon bill, and when the item provid- j
ing for the maintenance of the Seattle j
assay office was reached Loud said if the j
history of that office were to be made an '
open book the House would be astonished i
at the revelation. He said the assay of- ;
fice was established there ostensibly .for
the benefit of the poor miner, but really
for the benefit of one corporation, whose
headquarters is in Chicago.
He said there was no mint at Seattle,
and the assay office there was of no bene
fit to the San Francisco Mint and that a
concern for whose special benefit (by a
well-arranged combination) this assay
office was established, brought its dust
and bullion from Alaska, had It assayed
at Seattle, where it was sold and shipped
to Philadelphia for coinage. Loud said
the proposition now was to erect a public
building at Seattle for an assay office
and that it was high time the House un
derstood the facts of the case and that
this office ought to be discontinued.
Lewis of Washington replied to Loud in
defense of the Seattle office, and subse
quently they had a lively spat over
Lewis' Insinuation that Loud was dis
playing peculiar friendship for the Alaska
Commercial Company. It was an amus
ing and amiable colloquy, and while Loud
spoke very forcibly against it the item j
was retained in the bill.
Senators Perkins and White to-day j
called upon Secretary Gage and the Di
rector of the Mint regarding the discrim- !
ination of the Treasury Department j
against the San Francisco Mint and in
favor of Philadelphia ln coining bullion.
The Philadelphia Mint now has on hand
bullion that will require two years or
more for coining, yet bullion from the
West continues to he sent there. The de
partment disclaimed any intention to dis
criminate and will give the matter its at
tention with a desire to do full justice.
Senator White to-day presented in the
Senate the petition of the Anti-Debris ;
Association of California, requesting that |
the proposed improvement of Sacramento â

instead of being conducted by appropria
tions from session to session.

IMPROVEMENTS FOR

SACRAMENTO, Jan. There was a
meeting of the Auditing Board to the
Commissioner of Public Works at the
State Capitol this afternoon, called for
the.p urpose of winding up the business
of the commission for the year just j
closed. Balances on several claims for
work done in connection with improve- j
ments on** the' Sacramento River were j
allowed.
: A resolution was adopted calling upon
the Legislature to extend the field of i
the commission so as to include the
care of all the navigable rivers of the
State. As it is under the existing law,
the commission is restricted in its ope
rations to the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers. It has expended less
than one-third of the $300,000 appro
priation voted to it by the Legislature
two years ago, and, had it been clothed
with the proper authority, the commis
sion could have done much to improve
the condition of streams tributary to
the Sacramento and the San Joaquin,
both of which watercourses have shown
"substantial benefit from the commis
sion's work upon them.
TWO BOYS ROBBED
THE MISSOURI PACIFIC
They Confess a Sensational Hold-Up
in Which Young James Is

TOPEKA, Kans., Jan. 7.â The Jour
nal, in its last edition to-day, prints
a story to the effect that two To
peka boys, Seth Rosebrook and Chad
Stowell, scarcely 18 years of age, who
were arrested during the fall festival
last September for holding up a farmer,
and who were sent to the Hutchinson
Reformatory, are responsible for the
Missouri Pacific hold-up and express
robbery at Leeds, Mo., September 20
last. This is the robbery for which
Jesse James Jr. is now under Indict
ment and arrest in Kansas City. Un
der Sheriff Williams, who has been
working on the case for some time,
claims that young Stowell has made a
written confession and has divulged
where the booty, some $11,000, is hidden
in the woods about seventy-five miles
east of Kansas City.
Mr. Williams, Sheriff Cook and Chief
of Police Strauss have gone to the
place to find the money. They have no
doubt whatever of the success of the
quest, for Stowell has been tested and
It has been found that he has told the
truth so far as the details connected
with the robbery are concerned.

Cowardly Murder of a
Railway Workman.
TRAGEDY IN A BUNKHOUSE
FRANK NAGLE ASSASSINATED
AT PAULSELL.
Quarrels With a Fellow Laborer, Who
Arises in the Morning and
Kills Him in His
Couch. .â¢;
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Jan. 7.â Paulsell, a sta
tion on the Sierra railway, was this
morning the scene of an unusually cold
blooded murder. Frank Nagle, a sec
tion employe, was shot as he slept by
a fellow workman named Brend. The
assassin made his escape and up to a
late hour had not been captured. A
large posse of citizens is assisting the
officer in the hunt, and should Brend
be captured there may be no recourse
to the law to punish him for his crime.
Paulsell Is a point at which section
men on the Sierra Railway live. Nagle
and Brend stopped at the railway
boarding-house, bunking in a large
room with the rest of the section hands.
After they had finished the day's work
yesterday the two quarreled. Their
loud talk attracted the attention of the
foreman of the gang and he prevented I
a clash. Had it not been for his Inter
ference they would have come to blows
then and there. During the evening, i
though the men did not renew their j
quarrel, it was apparent that it was
not forgotten. Brend was especially
surly and bellicose, and gave it out that j
he would "do" his enemy before morn
ing.
Brend arose from his couch at about
5 o'clock this morning and dressed him- j
self stealthily, without arousing his |
comrades. Then, revolver in hand, he i
walked over to the couch of Nagle and ,
â¢deliberately began firing at the latter's I
prostrate form. The reports of his j
weapon aroused the other sleepers at |
once, but before they could interfere ;
Brend had fired several bullets into the
body of the reclining and defenseless
man. He then dashed out of the board
ing-house and escaped into the forest
growth that lines the railway.
Nagle lived two hours after he was
shot. It appears that after his quarrel
with Brend he had concluded to throw
up his position and leave the railway
camp, probably fearing treachery at the
hands of the man who afterward mur
dered him. He had packed his belong
ings and was to have left the camp
early this morning.
Every able-bodied man living in the
vicinity of the place where the crime
was committed has joined in the pur
suit of the murderer. Feeling runs
high and there is every probability that
Brend will be given short shift should
he be captured. As the mountains are |
snow-covered and Brend was without
provisions or adequate protection from
the inclement weather when he dashed
from the scene of his - cold-blooded
crime, it is likely that he will soon* be
driven from cover. The fellow has his
revolver with him and it is not likely
that he will surrender without a fight. I

MEAT INSPECTION MEASURES
NOT SO HARSH AS TO INJURE
â¢ AMERICAN PRODUCTS.
Sentiment in the Fatherland Appears
. to Be Changing in Favor
of the United
States.
.. Copyrighted by the Assoclataed Press.
,'. BERLIN*, Jan. 7. â The imperial meat
Inspection bill is again one of the fore
mast subjects discussed by the German
newspapers. This measure, early in
the week, was finally passed by the
Prussian Cabinet and has gone to the
Bundesrath, which, it is understood,
â¢ will make short work of it, as each of
.the- federal governments has already
considered it, and the present shape of
the 111 is virtually the result of muutal
concessions made by the several gov
ernments.
From an authoritative source it is
learned that the task of agreeing to its
â¢final form proved very difficult to the
South German governments, and es
pecially Wurtemburg and Bavaria,
vÂ»hich originally opposed any such leg
islation, since they, thus far, have not
been saddled with trichinosis inspec
tion, and saw no reason why the whole
empire should be saddled with an ex
pensive meat inspection merely because
Prussia wished it. It was in deference
to these South German votes that the
. Prussian Cabinet gradually cut down
the demands, and a number of the
Agrarian features of the original draft
â of the bill were eliminated. Two im
portant modifications are the dropping ,:
cf the clause providing for state re
muneration for all cattle and meat de
clared unfit for sale and the inserting
of a clause enforcing the inspection of |
all cattle and swine slaughtered for j
private consumption.
Th- correspondent here for the Asso
ciated Press Interviewed a high Prus
sian official concerning the measure,
â who said: "For America the most vital
and interesting features are that it j
-simplifies and unifies the method of in
spection, and that there will only be
one inspection. There will be no pro
hibition against any class of American
meat, though very strong pressure was I
brought to bear on the Government to
exclude certain kinds, and especially j
. sausage, canned meats and lard. The
Bundesrath. however, is given full
powers under the bill to make, in case
Of necessity, a decree declaring against
Any and all kinds of foreign meat. But
such action will not be taken unless
there is the strongest reason for it.
A -difficult problem is the treatment of
American sausage, which is left to the
: Bundesrath and Reichstag. Nothing
in the whole bill is devised with the
view of the impeding or preventing
American imports. The whole bill is j
fair and its methods cannot be im
pugned even in America."
The foregoing statements were sub
stantially corroborated by an American j
expert in Berlin to whom they were
'communicated. He said: "The tenor
â  of the bill shows that the Imperial Gov
ernment means to treat American !
meats fairly and on their merits. The
Option was given to the Bundesrath to
treat American meats with greater se
verity and corresponds with similar
power resting in the Secretary of Agri
culture on our side regarding certain
German imports. But the enforcement
of - the option will require specific proof
that American meats are injurious, and
that is out of the question. The bill
will not be an unmitigated evil for
American interests. Hitherto in Ger
many there has been no confidence in
our meat inspection; but there is al
most sacred confidence in German im
perial inspection. Henceforth any
American meats exposed for sale will
.be known to have been officially ap
proved, and the result will be a cor
responding increase in business, proba
bly doubling our sales. The only para
graph in the bill which is capable of
mischief, if unfairly applied, is the one
Which sets forth that all imported
meats must â¢me In certain cuts and
parts. We cut our meat differently
. from the Germans, so mischief may
lurk In that paragraph. However, I
feel confident that the German Gov
ernment will not apply the bill un
fairly, as it fully realizes that there
â¢would be no wisdom in such a course,
Eeeing that we hold trump cards in re- j
taliation." i
â¢â¢Another fact is that the Prussian
veterinary experts to whom all samples
of American meats, sausages, etc.. sus
pected of being affected with trichinosis
or other disease, have thus far been
Unable in any cases to confirm the sus
picions. The Government announces
that several loads of American fruits
Inspected for the San Jose scale were
recently seized at Hamburg and at
Stettin. In each case, however, the
scales were dead.
The German Chambers of Commerce
and industrial associations in their an
nual m reports this week have referred
mote or less freely to Germany's trade
with the United States. A majority of
them express the hope that commercial
relations will become closer and more
friendly. The Liepsic Chamber of Com
merce, one of the most important in
Germany, deplores the present uncer
tainty of the commercial relations with
both the United States and Great Brit
* am and says it trusts the Government
will strive to the utmost to re-establish
.permanently the best relations with
both countries. The Bunder der Indus
triellen, the Rhenish Manufacturing
Association, however, urges the Gov
ernment to adopt "prompt and ener
getic retaliatory measures against the
United States in view of the palpable
violations of the treaty."
The Bundesrath is now discussing a
Government bill, the so-calied Leix
Heinz, framed to suppress certain feat
ures of public and private immorality.
It also affects literature and art. This
â¢bill is a weakened copy of a measure
repeatedly introduced in the Reichstag
by Centrists and defeated. The Center,
â¢which is the dominant faction of the
Reichstag, publishes through its main
â¢organ, the Cologne Yolks Zeitung, its
intention of fighting the two leading
Government measures, the anti-strike
and military bills. At the same time it
condemns the constant increase in lese
. majeste trials and impugns the motives
underlying most of these cases, saying
it deplores the growing espionage which
is bred thereby.
: The expulsion of the Danes from
Northern Schleswig continues unabated
..and an overwhelming majority of the
'.papers continue to complain of the
' policy and deny its political wisdom
-The Cologne Gazette is an exception to
the rule. It urges all Germans to ap
prove the measure, which. It asserts is
necessary for patriotic reasons. The
' central committee, representing all the
commercial clubs and associations at
Berlin, met this week and formally con
demned the expulsion, which, the com
mittee collected statistics to show, has
â already done a vast amount of damage
to Germany- commerce.

The January Clearing movements in this store make interesting news for California's
careful shoppers. Every day some small lot, or odd lot, or lot not to be continued in stock, bobs up and
is marked down. Surplus lots from overstocked jobbers come to us at incredibly low prices, and all are
given newspaper publicity as fast as our space will allow. Read every January "ad." Something you
want, at less than you expected to pay, will surely appear.

THE EXAMINER'S OLD WOMEN.

THE virility of the Examiner astounding.
Though a beaten organ of a spurious Democ
y\ ' â¢*. racy, it actually has a "national policy" and
â¢ 'practically owns the country and runs the Govern
ment. Under its direction the annual report of the Sec
'y'"reta'fy of the Navy was prepared, and the first thing
â¢'.. the President of the United States does every morning
'.';: is to ascertain what the instructions of the Examiner
:..'â  are for his conduct during the day. Congress is filled
'/with it? representatives, who have nothing at all to
'â¢;. 'ido with the people, and it dictates every measure that
â¢Vji'is even seriously considered.
.'.' ", These views are derived from a careful reading of
'â¢.the Examiner itself. Its proclamations have virtually
'the force of law. It controls the army; the navy, for
... eign powers and even the religious potentates of the
: -\. earth,- and at its will summons them as Glendower

'â â¢ vHoar, who only fills the place of Daniel Webster, and
.Senator Hale, and others of similar obscurity, in
. '".daring to obstruct the acquisition of the Philippines,
â â¢â .'.is surprising. When they find, however, that the Ex

once lie down to unpleasant dreams.
THE CITY HALL "COMPLETED."
THE other day the New City Hall Commission
ers, without ceremony, turned the City Hall over
to the Board of Supervisors as "completed."
â There was rib beating of bands or flying of colors
over the important event. The only thing that has
been left behind to commemorate it was a report from
the secretary stating that the hall had cost about
$5,723,794 18, and that the appropriation had expired,
which' necessitated the retirement of the commission
from power.
â¢There is still a great deal to be done upon the edi
fice. The remodeling that will be necessary to make
the building habitable is bound in future years to cost
almost as much as the structure itself has cost. The
drainage should even now be reconstructed and an
adequate system of heating and ventilating intro
duced.' When the hall was planned neither of these
things entered into the calculations of the architects.
These gentlemen also ignored sunshine. They seemed
to have no idea that in San Francisco the sun is an
important substitute for stoves and grates.
"Looking back over the expanse of years one can
not fail to-be struck by the remarkable inefficiency
.which has prevailed in the construction of this edi
fice. The City Hall was begun in 1872, and is now
.turned over about half finished at the end of twenty-
Seven years. During all of that time work has pro
ceeded upon it with more or less energy. There was
'ofte time, about 1875. when the rascals had obtained
. such complete control over the building that the Leg
islature was' obliged to suspend operations for about
: two T years. There was another period of inactivity
after the adoption of the new constitution in 1879.
But with these exceptions the politicians have con
tinuously worked at the building.
.;.;:: During late years, however, the contractors have
been compelled to live up to their agreement, and
all the plunder has been squeezed out of the building.
As a rule, since 1882 work on the City Hall has pro
ceeded with care and economy; but architecturally
the thing is a botch, and the interior will have to be
remodeled if it ever becomes a modern structure.
The amount expended upon the building is not ex
cessive when compared with other public edifices of
like character. Still it cannot be called a cheap City
: Hall. A private individual could take the money that
has been spent upon it and build a structure in half
the time much better adapted to the needs of the city
and quite as durable and imposing, and make an
: enormous fortune out of the operation.

EXPOSITION ISSUES.
A LATE report from the East is to the effect that
while the space allotted to the United States tit
the Paris Exposition of 1900 is about 222,000
square feet, persons desirous of making exhibits of
their products have already applied for upward of
700,000 square feet. The fact is stated as a striking
evidence of the interest taken in the coming exposi
tion by the progressive manufacturers, artists and ag
riculturists of the country.
It is to be noted, furthermore, that a strong desire j
ii manifested in the Mississippi Valley States for
making at Paris a surpassing agricultural exhibit. I
Commenting upon this phase of the subject the Chi
cago Times says: "It is contended by those who are
interested in sending a creditable agricultural ex
hibit to Paris that we have never had a complete,
practical, comprehensive display of the nation's agri
cultural resources at any great exposition. Some of
the exhibits from single counties in Nebraska at the
Omaha Exposition surpassed the entire agricultural
display at the World's Pair."
The statement that exhibits from a single county in
Nebraska at the Omaha Exposition exceeded the en
tire agricultural display at the World's Fair at Chi
cago may be doubted. It is clearly an exaggeration.
None the less, it is true that a thoroughly representa
tive exhibit of the agricultural resources of the
United States has never been made, and the Paris
Exposition affords a most excellent opportunity to
make one. It is therefore gratifying to note Eastern
interest in that direction, for a liberal allowance of
space for an agricultural display is .bound to be of
advantage to California.
We have at this time three extensive exposition
projects under consideration â a colonial exposition at
Mechanics' Institute next fall, the Paris Exposition in
1000, and State Centennial Exposition in the year fol
lowing. The three enterprises will not conflict, but
mutually assist one another, since each in proportion
to its extent and magnitude will tend to augment pop
ular interest in exposition work and rouse the ener
gies of the people to make the utmost of the oppor
tunities.
It appears the report given out some time ago that
the space allotted to the United States at Paris is
larger than that granted to any other nation is a
mistake, as the Russians have been conceded more
space than ourselves. It is noted, moreover, that the j
Russian's, the British and the Germans have each
made more ample provisions for display than we have ;
done. .
An effort will be made to induce Congress to in- j
crease the appropriation for the purpose, and some
thing may be attained in that way; but after all the
greater part of the expense of our exhibit will have to
bi borne by individuals and by such States as intend j
to make distinctive State exhibits. That is one more j
reason why Californians should set about at once to <
make ready for the work. Since the Mississippi Val
ley is to make a special feature of the agricultural dis
play, we are going to have a good chance to measure
ourselves against that rich and populous section and
show all the world what rural industry can accomplish
in California.
EASTERN CONSCIENCE.
A RECENT editorial in the Outlook, of. which
Lyman Abbott is editor, and which is supposed
to represent the cultured thought of the most
intellectual circles .of the East, exhibits an amusing il
! lustration of the pretty conceit of themselves enter-
I taincd by our- Eastern, fellow citizens and their atti
tude of condescension toward the West.
The article in question declares ; there are three
popular arguments in favor of colonial expansion â
one prevalent on the Pacific Coast, one in the Middle
West and one in the East. That which is asserted to j
prevail here is the argument of commercial advantage, :
that which finds favor in the Mississippi Valley is the
argument of national grandeur, while in the East the
chief argument is that of a conscientious desire to
fulfill the whole duty of the hour toward the oppressed
people of the Philippines.
According to this view of the situation, several
times repeated in the article, the East is animated by
conscience, the Middle West by Americanism and our
section of the Union by self-interest. It is not worth '
while to point out the error of the writer in stating ;
that the Pacific Coast expects monetary gain from
annexation, since every intelligent man knows that
the great fruit, sugar and other industries of California
and Oregon would be seriously injured by the com
petition of the islands. The main point in the article
is the revelation it makes of the Eastern idea that
public opinion here is determined by self-interest,
while on the Atlantic coast it is determined by con
science.
About the time the editorial appeared in the Out
look a writer who furnishes a daily column of com
ment, semi-editorial, to the New York Press, a stanch
Republican paper, printed a seemingly authoritative
account of how Croker, the Tammany boss, got his
fortune. The writer said: "Many of the leading finan
ciers of Wall street were afraid of President Harri
son's position on the money question, and in the elec
tion of 1892 determined to defeat him for re-election.
Cleveland's known affiliation with prominent bankers
and operators in the street rendered him an accept
able candidate to Republican as well as Democratic
millionaires, and in order to insure his election a fund
of $1,000,000 was quietly raised and placed in the
hands of Richard Croker,. who was requested to 'put
it where it would do the most good.' It was 'any
j thing to beat Harrison,' and Croker was the instru
â  ment."
The story continues that Croker used $600,000 to
beat Harrison and pocketed the remaining $400,000.
Moreover, being aware that leading Republicans were
fighting Harrison, he bet $250,000 on Cleveland at
odds of 6to 5 and won $300,000 more. Furthermore,
it is added that when the Lexow Committee began its
work in New York Croker was ready to go on the
stand, but he was induced to leave the city lest the
Republican disloyalty to Harrison should be made
known, and the writer concludes by saying, "Croker
left New York, if I am not-very much mistaken, in
Chauncey M. Depcw's private palace car."
Read in connection with the Outlook's talk about
Eastern conscience and the, devotion of the Pacific
Coast to self-interest, that story, told with so much
circumstantiality and detail, has a moral in it so big
that you can't put the lid on. Before the Outlook de
livers any more lectures on the dominant motives of
the different sections of the Union, it should look in
a while and see what is going on at home.
Probably the Democrats who are urged to support
Burns will think more of the reputation of the party
and the State than of the chance to participate in a
disgraceful responsibility for the Mexican.

the Examiner they will ask for it. That paper's sup

THE CATTLEMEN'S CONVENTION;
ONE of the most notable industrial conventions
to be held in the United States during 'â¢â¢ the
present month is that of the .cattlemen at
Denver. The meeting has been looked' forward to
with considerable interest not only by stock-raisers,
but by meat-packers in all parts of the country, and
the results of the discussions promise to be of great
value.
The convention will be one of more than ordinary
j importance to California. Our cattle industry is large,
and we have, therefore, great interests to be affected
by what may be done at the meeting. It is probable
something may be accomplished there to assist in. re
lieving the industry in this State of the handicap that
now interferes with its advancement and thus tend to
make it more profitable than it has been for some
time past.
The drought which prevailed during the past sum
mer had the effect of forcibly impressing upon the
cattlemen of the State the need of a better system of
cattle quarantine. . The existing laws are grossly in
adequate to the needs of the industry. In his recent
message to the Legislature Governor Budd earnestly
recommended this subject as one deserving considera
tion during the present session. â¢ Referring to the dis
astrous experiences of the past season and the work
done by the State officials to remedy the evil, he
said:
"The Department of Agriculture has relieved our
condition. Its agents, with those of the State, have
worked diligently. The quarantine lilies, to meet the
varying conditions, have been changed, but we have
no proper laws to protect these lines. During the dry
season I was compelled to appeal to the Governors
of other States for permission to transport and feed
inspected cattle in their States. Had the cattlemen
of California seen the necessity for action in this mat
ter sooner and aided the efforts of the executive to se
cure the passage of a proper law as recommended,
they would not have suffered so severely during the
last dry season."
Upon this showing Governor Budd added the very
pertinent comment: "It may seem peculiar that a
State which has spent on agricultural societies within
a few years $1,054,229 should not have on the statute
books a proper law to protect its cattle, horses, sheep
or other animals or fowls, yet such is the fact, and
under the law public funds cannot be directly used for
such protection."
The convention at Denver will of course devote it-
I self to far wider considerations than those of State
quarantine laws, and yet it may devise plans that will
result in settling such regulations upon a uniform
basis. The principal theme of the convention will be
j of course the general outlook of the industry, for it
I is certain that the conditions which once made it so
! profitable are rapidly changing. The old days when
â¢ ranges rich in grasses and well supplied with water
j were abundant have gone by. Cattle-raising is no
: longer the simple and easy task it was a comparatively
few years ago.
Good ranges are now limited. Considerable risks
attend the industry, and science, capital and careful
foresight are necessary to make it profitable. The
cattlemen have a new set of problems 'to solve, and
the convention will have no lack of subjects to dis
cuss. It is to be hoped the meeting will result in the
formulation of plans that when carried out will prove
beneficial to the industry throughout the whole cattle
raising region of the Great West.
BRITISH COLUMBIAN FOLLY.
A REPORT from Victoria states that at the
opening of the Provincial Legislature of Brit
ish Columbia Lieutenant Governor Mclnnes,
in reviewing the affairs of the province and outlining
prospective legislation, announced it would be the
policy of the Government to exclude aliens from
placer mining, and that the Legislature would be re
quested to enact a law to that effect.
Referring to the gold discoveries in the Cariboo
and the Omineca districts and the country around
Atlin Lake, he is quoted as having said: "In antici
pation of an influx of population into that region my
Government has already taken steps for the proper
administration of the district. In order to conserve
the natural wealth in these gold gravels for the bene
fit of Canadian miners and Canadian traders a bill
will be laid before you prohibiting the acquisition of
placer claims by aliens."
The unfriendliness of this act to American miners
will be noted and its injustice will be condemned,
for we have never excluded Canadian miners from the
placer districts of this country; but the ill effects of
the proposed legislation, if it be carried out, will be
felt by British Columbia more than by ourselves.
Such a law would be about as gross a blunder as any
legislative body has committed in recent years.
It requires no great degree of intelligence to per
ceive that the chief need of British Columbia at this
time is a larger and more enterprising population to
develop the resources of the country- The discoveries
of gold in the province promised to attract to it
thousands of men who would have carried into its
wildernesses not only their energy and their labor,
but a considerable amount of capital. These men
would have been the pioneers of civilization and
cleared the way for the foundation of towns and the
construction of railroads. To shut them out is simply
to deprive British Columbia of the most potent allies
she could have in her industrial development.
The United States, on the other hand, will derive
benefits from the law, should it be enacted and con
sistently enforced. By its operation many miners who
would have gone into the British Columbian gold
fields will be shut out from those districts and will
employ their energies either at home or in developing
the resources of Alaska. We shall thus be the gainer
of that much energy and labor. In fact, it would be
to our advantage if the British Columbians would ex
clude from their gold fields not only our placer
miners, but all kinds of miners, and thus compel them
to use their capital and their skill in working the
mines of their own country.
Whether the British Columbian Legislature will
enact the proposed law remains to be seen. If they
should be so foolish as to shut out the Americans
who might have gone there to build up their province,
we may justly retaliate by shutting Canadians out of
Alaskan gold fields, but we are not likely to do so.
When a rival is committing a blunder he should never
be interrupted nor imitated.
Counties which press their claims against the State
for rebates on taxes are simply trying to experience
the joy of taking money from one pocket and putting
it in the other, although they cannot hope to put in
as much as they extract, for the attorneys have not
entered into the scheme with any view to the promo
tion of health. r< --r.*",-

THE TELEPHONE SCANDAL.
2> From the Outpost.
It does not seem possible that The Call would make Ith so much
directness and circumstantiality its charges of corruption against the
local telephone company unless it were perfectly sure of its position,
for the charges are of a most scandalous and damaging character, and
if untrue lay the millionaire owner of that paper liable to heavy
damages. The story told by The Call is. substantially this: That the
telephone company has its employes take down messages passing be
tween its customers, and that those messages are filed away and in
dexed; that there is a "listening room" connected with the central
office, anu that trusted employes of the company sit therein and
make a record of private and important conversations carried on be
tween its patrons, who assume, of course, that the privacy of their
communications is strictly guarded; that in the case of customers
who desire their telephone numbers kept out of the directory, the
company sells the numbers kept to persons desiring them, but having
no right to them; that the employes of the company take down im
portant news telephoned exclusively to one paper and then sell it to
other papers or otherwise dispose of it to them. These charges are
made positively, without the slightest equivocation. Presumably
The Call would not dare to make them unless it knew them to be
true. .!
If they are true, the most remarkable and shameful of all the in
numerable scandals that have cursed San Francisco is exposed. It
seems incredible that such a man as John I. Sabin, president of the
company, should be a party to the despicable business, but if laxity
on his part has permitted it to exist without his knowledge,' he can
not be held blameless.
How the evil can be stopped and punished is another matter. With
popular confidence in the service entirely destroyed much of the com
pany's business will naturally fall away. That would greatly cripple
the public as well as the company. This company conducts Its busi
ness under the sanction of the city government. If some other com
pany can give a better service it should be permitted and en
couraged to establish itself. Meanwhile the present company cannot
afford to ignore The >. .11 _ charges. That would be a confession of
its guilt or laxity. At this writing, early in the week, the company
has loftily, according to The Call, refused to make any explanation.
It is always so with powerful corporations having a monopoly of a
valuable and highly remunerative public service. Only competition
makes them tractable and trustworthy. There is nothing more fa
miliar to the public than the insolence of this telephone company.
Its lordliness and overbearing conduct are exceedingly offensive. The
unfortunate girls at the switchboard are the victims of public resent
ment of the company's insolenceâ a heedless public tortures them for
the shortcomings of their employers.
What have the leading men who own shares in this concern to say
about the scandal?

For three years after leaving his theological studies he was pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Peoria. Within that time he built a new
church at a cost of $50,000. From 1890 to 1894 he preached from the pulpit
of the First Church in Evanston. where he likewise upreared a new church
building. In December, 1894, he succeeeded Prof. Swing at Central Church.
Chicago. The new pastor of Plymouth will preach in Brooklyn the same
creed he has preached in Chicago. It is the creed of broadest Christianity
and humanity, of Beecher. of Swing, of Abbott, of Hillis. Dr. Hillis. like his
predecessors of Plymouth and Central churches, is a writer. The four
books he has published are widely read. They are "Foretokens of Immor
tality," "How the Inner Light Failed," "A Man's Value to Society," "The
Investment of Influence." Dr. Hillis has been called "The poet-preacher of
the end of the century." .

ADVERTISEMENTS.
WAR DECLARED
IN FURNITURE TRADE,
Yes, war is declared. No diplomatic
beating about the bush; no protocols
nor ultimatums, but a simple opening
fire. Biff: Bang! Bomb! Boom! Just
listen to the cannons roar.
Why, what's the matter?
Pattosien's, in the Mission, were cut-
ting prices 10 to 20 per cent on certain
lines of goods, and the high-priced
combine didn't like it, and the pay-as-
you-please concern hated the thought
of it. and the hundred per cent for in-
stallments house were disgustedand
the decoy duck store was disgruntledâ
and the soiled dove sign-writing house
felt hurt, so they laid their heads to-
gether and said, "We will lay Patto-
sien's in the dust," and so saying, they
brought on the war by blowing up the
Maine.
What mean you by that?
Why, they sent out Bast and -rot cer-
tain manufacturers to stop sending out
certain lines of goods.
That didn't stop Pattosien's from
selling them allee samee, did it? ;
My word, no! It takes a good many
flea bites and mosquito stings to kill
such a firm as that. They forgot Pat-
tosien's have resources unlimited.
What did Pattosien's do?
Declared war, I tell you! A furni-
ture war! They have thrown down the
! gauntlet, thrown it right into the ring
! and let who dares take it un: It is war
'to the knife! A fieht to a finish! They,
"fear no foe in shining armor."
How will they fight? What are their
weapons?
Import goods of a still higher grade
to take the place of the line that stop-
ped short and cut prices for the higher
class goods; cut prices on furniture,
slashed prices on carpets, cut prices on
rugs and curtainsâ prices on
everything. Whereas they did cut 10,
per cent and 20, now they will cut 30
and 40 per cent, and they care not who
knows it.
That's well, but will they keep It up?
The question shows you don't know
Pattosien's and their great two-acre
store in the Mission; their splendid
goods, their grit, energy, pluck, push'
and daring. When they array them-'
selves in battle front and say with
Macbeth:
"Lay on, Macduff, and d d be he
who first cries. Hold! Enough!"
Then we shall see some lively rough
and tumble work in the house furnish-
ing trade.
What is the first volley Pattosien's
have fired?
A battery of bargainsâhere they are:
Solid oak .bedrocm sets, rubbed
and polished, formerly $28, now $18.
; Mahogany and rich golden oak bed-
room suits, formerly $35, now $25. .
Beautiful bedroom suits in oak,
mahogany or Circassian walnut,
worth from $60 to $125 each, cut one-
third!!!
And in the big second floor carpet
department there are cuts of equal
magnitude. Two hundred rolls of the
finest and most beautiful patterns of
the well-known Roxbury make are
sold at 75 cents per yard, sewed and
laid.
In fact, in the parlor furniture de-
partment. In the curtain department,
the bedding department, the stove de-
partment, indeed, all over this vast,
busy and brilliant mart of trade there
are such a galaxy of bargains that
there is not space to describe a com-
plete resume or give a perfect idea of
the immensity of the buyers' oppor-
tunity.

WAS LAID UP DURING THE WAR
HER CREW NOW EXPECTS TO
SEE SOME FIGHTING.

Have Changed Vessels â
ing of the China for
the Orient.
.The United States gunboat Yorktown
â¢ came down from Mare Island yesterday.
.:Her last voyage was in Alaskan waters,
.from which she returned prior to the war
and went to the navy-yard for an over
hauling. The repairs were not completed
â .-in- time, so she never donned her war
paint. She is now in her peace colors as
a member of the white squadron, but her
'crew seem to think that they will have
a chance to do some fighting after all, as
she has been ordered to Manila ln a
:hurry.
;. Coming down from the navy-yard the
Yorktown and Nero passed each other,
-and the crew of the gunboat cheered the
men of the Olympia, who were aboard the
collier. The latter were not slow to re
spond, and for a few moments there was
â¢a ping of flags and wild cheering as
â¢.Uncle Sam's vessels passed each other.
-.''. The Yorktown was originally destined
for Samoa, to look after the interests of
the United States in those islands. She
was supplied with the charts for the Pa
cific, and everything was made ready for
a long stay in the Southern Seas. Yes
terday all these plans were changed, and !
the commandant at Mare Island received
orders to send the gunboat at once to
Manila. She was supplied on her arrival
here with the Asiatic charts and all the
latest ones of the Philippines. No time
will be lost in getting her away, and she
is expected to make a quick run to Ma
nila. A short stop will be made at Hono
lulu for coal, and from that port she will
â¢ proceed under full steam. From this it
...would look as though Aguinaldo was not j
going to back down and that there will
; be more fighting after all.
â¢â ; The Pacific Mail Company's steamer i
. China sailed for the Orient yesterday. She
: : . took away all the cabin passengers she !
...could accommodate and a big crowd of j
. Chinese. Some of her cargo had to be i
'â â¢ left' behind in order to make room for i
'â¢'â¢passengers. Among the stuff aboard are \
... spine heavy consignments for Manila and .
: many packages for the soldier boys.
'-' _'he British bark Brunei arrived from
;.A.'n twerp yesterday, after a passage of
â¢ 14S days. She left over a month after the
â¢ship Wallacetown. which has not yet
â¢-..'â¢ reached here. The latter vessel was
". caught in a terrific storm and had to put
. 'nto.Coqulmbo for repairs. She sailed
' again on November 23 for San Francisco.
.The man who fell from a hayloft on
. Oregon street last Thursday- night was
identified In the Harbor Receiving Hop

â  -Henry Rademeyer. During the afternoon
â¢'â he; died. The deceased was formerly em

THE YORKTOWN COMING DOWN FROM MARE ISLAND.
THE gunboat was to have gone to Samoa to look after American interests in the islands, but the state of af
fairs in the Philippines necessitated a change in the plans. Asiatic and the latest charts of the islands have
been put aboard and the gunboat will sail at once for Manila via Honolulu. She was undergoing repairs
at the navy yard during the war and the crew is now in hopes of seeing some fighting before everything is on

THIRTEEN A MONTH
AND GARRISON DUTY
NOT ALLURING TO THE MEN
OF THE EIGHTH REGIMENT.
They Object to the Statement That
Nine-Tenths of Them Want
. to Stay.
The men of the Eighth Regiment are
suffering from a revolution of feeling.
Scarcely had the cheer which greeted the
order to muster them out died away when
another order arrived postponing the mus
tering out, because it had been reported
to headquarters that the men want to
stay.
â¢"Stayâ on $13 a month and garrison
duty." is the only answer the men make
to this statement of their feelings.
A poll of Company F and Company A
at Angel Island was taken yesterday
morning, and from one there were five
and from the other nine men who pre
ferred barracks and tents to home. At
Benicia and at the Presidio it was the
same. Yet the report that nine-tenths
of the men wanted to remain in service
was sent on to Washington by Colonel
Hens haw.
The Eighth has never been a kicking
regiment. It enlisted for service, but j
raised no protest when garrison duty was
all that fell to its lot, and when other
younger, smaller, more poorly quipped .
and more political regiments came and <
lingered and then passed it by. There
has been no dissension in the regiment
and the work assigned to It has been done
well. The men declare they do not want
to be placed in the position of debating
any order issued or of objecting to the
actions of higher authority, but they do
not want to stay in service, and they do
not want that order mustering them out
recalled. It was welcomed with cheers
when it came and its suspension has
caused the first murmur which has arisen
from the ranks of the regiment. .â¢--.'*

Silent Workers Appeal to the Public
for Their Relief.
The Band of Silent Workers have ap
pealed to the public for aid. Since their
organization last March they have made
noble efforts to assist the poor residing
ln the districts in which they work, and
have up to the present time succeeded
in bringing cheer Into the homes of tne
wretched and in lightening their burden
of destitution. The prevalence of sickness
among the poor has drawn so upon their
resources that they now find themselves
unable to cope with every emergency
These charitable people work within a
district bounded by .Folsom street and the
bay, between Fifth and Sixth streets In
this section are the families of laboring
men, many of whom are at present ill
and without means to supply the neces
sities of life for their little ones. In
some cases their children are victims of
the measles, and more sick beds than one
are in one room. They estimate that
there are at least a hundred famines
solely dependent upon them for aid.
An earnest appeal is made for food and
clothing, as well as contributions. They
also solicit the assistance of workers who
will go with them into the homes where
need Is apparent and give them. a helping
hand. Any contributions of money or ma
terial may be sent to their Free Klnder
farten School and headquarters at 934
larrison street, from which place it will
be distributed throughout their territory.

CHINESE CALL
THE POLICE
BLACKMAILERS
Educational Society Is
Indignant.
HARBOR NO HIGHBINDERS
THEY CLAIM THE OFFICERS ARE
PERSECUTING THEM.
Want Money From the Members, and
Not Getting It, Threaten to
Break Up the Organ
ization.
The Chinese Society for English Edu
cation, with headquarters at 709 Com
mercial street, is much exercised over
the charges made by the police that it is
an organization of highbinders, and the
members claim that the charges are en
tirely false. They assert that the society
was organized solely for the advance
ment of members in the English lan
guage and that the members are entirely
opposed to slave dealing and other pur
suits prohibited by law. They further
claim that the po..ce are persecuting
them in order to compel them to give
money and thereby gain immunity from
police scrutiny.
The society was organized two years
ago and since that time, the members
claim, classes in English have been held
constantly. The hours of meeting are
from 7:30 to 9:30 o'clock p, m., and the
members are at that time instructed in
the English language by an English
teacher. Aside from the meetings held
at these hours there are no others, ex
cept when special meetings are called to
transact business, such as raising funds
to keep the association alive. The soci
ety, so the members say, has always in
terested itself in English charities, hav
ing donated liberally to the Red Cross
and the missions.
The officers of the society at the pres
ent time are: Chin Jin, presiuent: Horn
Hay Yit, secretary, and twelve directors,
who, It is claimed, are all reputable mer
chants. An Indignation meeting was held
at the society's rooms last night and the
members were strong in their denuncia
tion of the police for branding them as
highbinders and blackmailers. As an
evidence of their respectability they have
secured the signatures of twenty mer
chants who attest that the society is or
ganized only for good and is not engaged
in anything illegal.
Besides denying that they are black
mailers the members of the society make
counter charges against the police. They
claim that for some time past officers in
Chinatown have been attempting to
"shake down" the society and when un
able to secure money threatened trouble.
The arrest of Ong Foon for attempted
extortion, the Chinamen claim, is merely
a play made by the police to frighten the
society into filling the itching palms of
the police. Asserting their innocence the
members say they will fisrht the case to
the bitter end and will make no compro
mise with the officers.
The police, on their part, will not take
back water on their claim that the soci
ety is a highbinder long. The injunction
filed by the Chinamen has for a time put
a stop to the breaking-up of the society,
but as soon as the suit is settled, work to
that end will be begun immediately. In
the mean time the society headquarters
and the members are being closely
watched. The assertion of the Chinamen
that reputable merchants will vouch for
the society Is scoffed at by the police and
the officers claim that every reputable
merchant In Chinatown will testify to the
disreputable character of the society.
La Estrelia Installs.
The officers of La Estrelia Parlor, Na
tive Daughters of the Golden West, were
installed last night by District. Deputy
Mrs. Theodore Lunsted, assisted by
Grand Marshal Mrs. Lena B. Mills. The
ceremony was private, but at the close
there was a collation and the presenta
tion to the retiring president, Mrs. Aigel
tlnger, by Mrs. Lunsted on behalf of the
parlor of a bangle bracelet, on which
there is a small star emblematic of the
parlor and in the center a diamond.

WESTERN PRODUCTS
IN PHILADELPHIA
NATIONAL COMMERCIAL MUSE
UM'S OBJECTS.
A Branch to Be Established in This
Benefits to California's
Many Industries.
The Philadelphia Commercial Museum
is branching out in all directions to In
crease the commerce of the United States,
and San Francisco is receiving not a little
attention at the hands of its manage
ment, yyy â â y^y.\y.-.j.i2.;y
The name of the Philadelphia institu
tion is misleading, as It is a national com
mercial: museum instead of its interests
being confined to the City of Brotherly-
Love alone. The aim, as has been stated,
is to gather Information useful to busi
ness men and industrial bodies from all
parts of the world as to the conditions of
trade, crops, money matters, etc. Bul
letins will be sent to all member bodies.
Besides this the managers of the museum
propose to gather one of the finest ex
hibits of natural and manufactured
products of the United States that has
ever been assembled.
As the museum is being extensively ad
vertised in all parts of the world, and
especially in the Central and South Amer
ican countries, buyers from those parts
will naturally- -regard it as the head
quarters of information when making
purchases. California has already taken
steps through its several commercial and
industrial bodies to affiliate with the mu
seum. Tim the Western coast is being
looked to as one of the great producing
sections of the United States is shown by
the following letter received yesterday by
the Merchants' Association, which is one
of the Western members. -' - Â
We have your letter of December 31, with
accompanying copies of the Merchants' Review,
which contains an account of this Institution.
We appreciate the way in which you have
presented the work to the business men of
California and shall be very glad to assist
them in any way possible to build up the export
business which certainly awaits them in many
foreign markets.
Due note has been taken of your suggestion
that this Institution might locate a branch bu
reau of information in San Francisco, with
special reference to the markets of the west
coast of South America, Oceanlca, Asia and
Australia. This Is a suggestion which has al
ready received our careful" consideration and
which we would be glad to carry Into effect at
such time as might seem .most opportune.
Meantime the practical suggestions of your
business would be appreciated, and it .might
be of some service in this direction If a com
mittee representing Callfornian interests were
to Inspect' this institution and to determine
along Just what lines its work may be made
more useful to the industrial and commercial
interests of the Pacific Coast. We appreciate
the suggestion and shall certainly not fall to
consult your association when the time for ac
tion arrives. â¢ â¢ â¢ Respectfully.

CRAIG TO BE FREE.
Pardoned After Years of Trouble
Over World's Fair Difficulties.
On Tuesday John Craig, formerly as
sistant secretary of the California
World's Fair Commission, will walk out
of the County Jail a free man. having
been pardoned by Governor Budd. After
waiting for six years the case against
Craig was brought up suddenly last May
when he. and his attorney, Eugene' N.
Deuprey, had but one day to prepare for
an immediate hearing. In spite of this
the jury . disagreed, six voting for ac
quittal. At the next trial a conviction
was secured, as Craig's only witnesses
were not present, one being dead and
the other in the Klondike.
Witnesses of high standing in the State,
Including county officials and police de
tectives of Stockton, army officers, attor
neys, a bank cashier and several others,
some fifteen in all. testified as to Craig's
high character, but as he had no one
to corroborate his story, he was convicted.
No one who had personally known Craig
believed him guilty. Craig Is to be re
leased without having had to serve a day
ln State's Prison.
ATTACKED BY FOOTPAD.
Daniel Twomey, a Fireman, Assault-
Ed With a Club on Ellis Street.
Daniel Twomey, a fireman employed on
engine 34, is the latest victim of footpads,
and in all probability the fact that he is a
powerfully built man alone saved him
from serious injury and financial loss.
Twomey sleeps in the engine-house on
Ellis street, near Gough. He was going
home late at night, and when near the
corner of Ellis and Franklin streets was
approached by a ruffianly looking man,
who gruffly demanded money. Twomey
pushed him aside and passed on. He had
proceeded but a few steps when he was
struck a stunning blow on the back of
the head with a blunt instrument, pre
sumably a loaded club. The footpad was
the shorter man of the two by some
Inches, and the blow, while a heavy one,
was not sufficient to fell the fireman, as
It was calculated to do. On the contrary,
Twomey faced around and made a right
hand swing at his .assailant, but missed
him. The footpad, seeing his plans had
miscarried, took to his heels and ran
down the street. Twomey did not pursue
him, as he feared the man might have a
revolver. He was able to give a good de
scription of the man to the police, and
detectives are now looking for him.
Pawned the Diamonds.
Joseph Hall, an agent' for the Occidental
Watch Company, with his wife, was ar
rested last night by Detective ODea and
booked on three charges each of felony
embezzlement. The complaining witness
is A. J. Eaton, manager for the watch
company. He alleges that he gave Hall
diamonds worth $800 to sell and that the
latter's - wife pawner them.
Detective ODea has recovered three of
the precious stones, and a gold watch
which was intrusted to the care of Hall,
from various pawnshops.

MORE EFFECTIVE STATE BODY
ABOUT THE GUARDSMEN WHO
WENT TO SACRAMENTO.
Candidates Up to Date for Adjutant
â Notes â¢of California
Boys Stationed, at
> Manila.
The bill which Major General Dickinson
has prepared to the end that the National
Guard of this State may be reorganized
on a basis that it is thought will make
it more effective than it has ever been
has not yet been presented to the Senate,
but it will probably be offered within the
next ten days.
In view of a possible reorganization and
the fact that the views of the new com
mander in chief have not yet been ascer
tained on the subject of the armed force
of the State, it has been decided not to
take any further steps for the present in
regard to recruiting the companies and
filling the regiments.
Who will be the adjutant general under
the new administration is one of those
questions that no one at this time can
answer. The candidates are numerous,
and each feels a reasonable certainty that
he will be the lucky one. Those who are
aspirants for the office arei Colonels J.
C. Currier and G. F. Stone of San Fran
cisco; Major Jansen, inspector of the Sec
ond Brigade; Colonel Johnson of the Sixth
Infantry, J. B. Bushnell of Los Angeles
and Colonels Ensign and Schreiber, Cap
tain Cross and W. H. Seaman, all from
the southern part of the State.
j A matter that excited considerable com
! ment in National Guard circles is the
fact that when ompany A of the Fifth In
fantry, Captain Poulter, seventy me
strong, in full dress uniform, went to
Sacramento to assist at the inaugural
ceremonies the visitors were not mot _
the depot by either a committee or the
membership of Company G, Second In
j fantry, located in the capital city, but the
I men from Oakland were allowed to shift
| for themselves. They were not even ten
dered the hospitality of the armory of the
| company named to rest for a while after |
their long ride. The company was a
prominent feature in the parade and pre
sented a line appearance.
Tnirty-rtve or the thirty-nine men of
the Signal Corps of the Second Brigade,
Captain Hewes commanding, went to Sac
ramento to take part in the inaugural
! ceremonies. The four who absented them
selves were excused for good and suffi
| cient reasons. The corps proceeded to the
capital in a special car, and at the depot
' was met by tne membership of the Signal
I Corps of tne Third Brigade and escorted
I to the armory, where there was an ex
cellent supper in waiting for the visitors.
, The men were made tne special guests
i of the Sacramento corps, which not only
â  provided food but furnished shelter. The
i following day the visiting corps acted as
; escort to the retiring Governor, James H.
; Budd, and during the procession was the
: special escort to the Governor-elect. The
; men were formed into two platoons, one
! mounted on gray horses and the other on
j bay. The men were formed in the shape
, of three sides of a hollow square, the men
j on the grays forming the front and the
! two sides being of men mounted on bays.
Within this was the carriage of the Gov
! ernor-elect, drawn by six white horses.
I The fine appearance of the men from San
! Francisco was the subject of much favor
| able comment. The men of the Sacra
, mento corps did not take part in the pa
rade, but after the ceremonies they again
i took charge of the visitors, escorted them
to the train and bade them good-by.
The 'first meeting of the Signal Corps
of the Second Brigade since the December
vacation was held at the armory of the
Nationals last Thursday night. It was a
business meeting, and there were present
' several veterans of the corps. There were
i in attendance in all thirty-nine. The
: drills will be resumed next Thursday, and
i there will be work for the three classes in
! all the branches of the service. The ex
perience of the late war has shown that
telegraphy is the most important branch
of the signal service, and while flag sig
naling and heliographlng are not to be
considered useless, the commander of the
corps has determined to make the men
proficient in the working of telegraphic
instruments, the laying of wires, repairs,
submarine cable laying and all that is
requisite in the transmission of orders
from one point to another; but while the
men are being converted into tickers they
will be required to keep up their knowl
edge of flags, wands and flashlights.
The naval militia also made a good
showing on the streets of Sacramento.
There was the first and second division,
also part of the engineer division, in all
ninety-six men, and they were divided
into a platoon of artillery and two sec
tions ot infantry. The majority of the
men and ail the office) slept on board
the â¢ Marion on Tuesday night, so there
should be no delay to take the 7 o'clock
train the following morning. When the
naval contingent reached its destination
it was net V_ Company A of the Fifth
Infantry with a band and escorted to
one of the hotels, where the men were
served a lunch. After the parade they
were entertained by the members of

"LEFTY" BANNON AS
POLICE COURT JANITOR
JUDGE CONLAN REFUSES TO AL
LOW HIM IN HIS ROOM.
He Expresses the Fear That Every
thing Portable in the Court
Will Be Pawned.
Judge Conlan was amazed yesterday
when he learned that the janitor assigned
to his courtroom was the notorious Wil
liam Bannon, better known as "Lefty,"
from the effective blows he could deliver
upon a drunken opponent with his left
hand.
The Judge In open court instructed
Bailiff Kelly not to deliver the keys of
the courtroom to Bannon and to get a
"trusty" from the City Prison to do the
work.
"I know Bannon too well,*' said the
Judge, "and I don't want to get search
warrants to recover the property in the
court and in my chambers from pawn
shone. I have had him in my court time
; and again and he is too dangerous a
character for me to have anything to do
â  with."
"Lefty" is looked upon by the police as
â¢one of the most dangerous characters
south of Market street, and his two
brothers, Patrick and Philip, are as bad.
Patrick was sentenced to thirty days by
Judge Conlan yesterday for stealing a
: pair of shoes from a cellmate at the
Seventeenth-street Police station. There
! is also a charge of grand larceny pending
against him and his brother, Philip, for
stealing two valises from an express

been scarcely any perceptible movement
to the wind and it has been shifting a

with clearing weather.
"The present rain has extended from
the vicinity of Fresno and San Luis

heaviest rainfall in California was right

and the upper San Joaquin has not had
any rain up to the present time. It has
not extended beyond south of Fresno and

. WASHINGTON, Jan. 'Â- A system of

SOME CANNED
BEEF WAS BAD
But Generally Supplies
Were Good.
SO SAYS MAJOR BLACK
RATHER VAGUE TESTIMONY OF
A COMMISSARY.
â¢
General Eagan Will Reappear Before
the War Investigation Commis
sion to Meet the Charges
as to Beef.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.â Major John
Black, commissary of subsistence in the
office of the commanding general, testi
fied b< ' re the War Investigating Com
mission to-day that the general char
acter of the commissary supplies was
good.
He was examined particularly as to
the quality of the beef issued in Porto
Rico and stated that it was generally
good, though some of the refrigerated
beef was covered with "dark, muddy
spots." He had been told that this did
not affect the quality of the beef.
Of the tinned beef 84,000 pounds were
issued. Witness tasted it only once. He j
was hungry and it tasted fairly well.
It did not look well and there were
numerous complaints of bad canned
beef, and in these cases the bad cans
were replaced. Later, he said, he had
received no complaints personally, but !
whatever reports were made were made \
to the depot commissary, Captain
Pomeroy. All he knew of these reports
he had gleaned from conversation with
Captain Pomeroy. He did not know
that any regular reports were made
even to Captain Pomeroy, but under
stood that there was a general verbal
complaint as to the tinned beef.
Witness then read a report he had
made to General Miles after their re
turn to New York. It was based on the
conversations just referred to and said
in part that some of the hospital sur
geons had refused to accept the refrig
erator beef on the ground of its ap
pearance, and one surgeon (witness did
not remember the name) had ordered
some of it buried.
Major Black stated that in the expe
dition of General Miles to Porto Rico
many of the captains of the vessels re
ported that they had no knowledge of
what they had aboard. He referred to
a delay in landing supplies of hospital
tents, cots and lounges from the Con
cho, and said General Brooke had
stated to Surgeon Greenleaf that he
had sick men lying on the ground with
no supplies available.
It was stated at the commission that
it had been decided to allow General
Eagan to retestify, as he had requested
to be permitted to meet the beef
charges. He is expected to appear
again early next week.

STANFORD DEAD
Succumbs to an Attack
of Pneumonia.
MOURNING AT PALO ALTO
STRICKEN MAN "WAS PROFESSOR
OF BIONOMICS.
Became an Instructor in the Uni
versity Seven Years Ago, and
Filled Many Important
Places.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 7.â
Rev. W. W. Thoburn, professor of bio
nomics, died of pneumonia at 11 o'clock
last night at his home. Death was not
altogether unexpected, as Dr. Thoburn
had been very low for several days. -
Wilbur Wilson Thoburn was born in
Belmont County, Ohio, in 1&59 and re
ceived his higher education in Alle
gheny College, from which he took the
degrees of A.8., A.M. and Ph.D., the
latter being granted in ISSB. Before
coming to this coast in 1888 as professor
of geology and biology in the Uni
versity of the Pacific he held important
positions in the East, being teacher of
natural science in the Pennsylvania
State Normal School in 1881-84 and pro
fessor of geology and botany in the Il
linois Wesleyan University, 1884-88.
In 1891, while occupying the pulpit
of the Methodist Church at Mayfield,
Dr. Thoburn became connected with
Stanford University, entering the de
partment of zoology under Dr. Gilbert.
After becoming an instructor in the
university he did not discontinue his re
ligious work, but directed his energies
more directly on the college student
body. He became the university
preacher and chairman of the execu
tive committee of the University Chapel
Union. He has served on some of the
most important faculty committees and
i was very near to Dr. Jordan, with
! whom he was associated in bionomics.
Dr. Thoburn has always taken a
great interest in university extension
and institute work and is well known
throughout the State. He leaves a
widow and three children.
The funeral will take place at 2 p. m.
to-morrow from the family residence.
The interment will be in the faculty
cemetery in the arboretum.

They Are Giving These
Conventions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND. Jan. 7.â The Farmers'
Institute was brought to a close last
evening, after a very interesting ses
sion in the Opera-house. The first num
ber on the programme was a pleasing
violin solo by G. W. Windsor. The
Woodland Quartet, composed of Messrs.
Craig, Malcolm, Steele and Wright,
with Norman Peart as accompanist,
rendered a pretty selection.
A paper entitled" Why Should We Buy
and Trade at Home?" was read by Miss
Calthea Vivian. It was written by C.
W. Thomas, but owing to illness he
could not be present. It was an able,
logical argument.
The address of Mr. Thomas was fol
lowed by a vocal solo by Miss Annie
Prior, with Miss Myrtle Gable as ac
companist. Miss Prior sang sweetly,
and was compelled to respond to an
encore.
Professor Fowler followed with an
address on "Some Problems in Irriga
tion; Is Pumping for Irrigation Profit
able?" He ably handled the subject and
gave some valuable information.
The institute adjourned after the
adoption of the following resolutions:
Resolved, That the thanks of this insti
tute be given to each and all of the musi
cians and others who so freely and cheer
fully gave us their talents, lending much
to the pleasure of those who attended the
institute and greatly aiding the commit
tee of arrangements in their efforts to
present an attractive programme.
Resolved, That we earnestly thank Pro
fessors Fowler and Woodworth for their
untiring labor and for their energy and
ability in presenting to this community
the best labors of their lifework, and for
the interest they have taken in agricul
tural and industrial enterprises so much
needed in Sacramento Valley, and that we
hereby express our appreciation of their
labors; that we most earnestly thank the
regents of the State University for this
opportunity to be entertained, benefited
and instructed by these professors, sent
to us at the expense of the State of Cali
fornia.
Resolved, That we thank the merchants
of Woodland for the Interest taken dv
them in this institute; and those mer
chants who have so willingly devoted
their time and energy to make this insti
tute a success; and that we thank those
who contributed the money necessary to
pay the expenses of the institute.
Resolved. That these resolutions be
published in the local press.

Tax Commission Suits
Denounced.
SACRAMENTANS ARE IN ARMS
SUPERVISORS ASKED TO RESCIND
THE CONTRACT.
Legislators Formulate Bills to Pre
vent Enterprising Attorneys Re
peating the Game in the
Future.
Ececial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 7.â number
of well-known citizens, members of the
Chamber of Commerce and of the Pa
trons of Husbandry, representing the
mercantile and farming interests, ap
peared before the Board of Supervisors
here to-day and argued for the annull
ment of the contract entered into- by
the Supervisors with Devlin & Devlin
of Sacramento and Rogers, Paterson &
Slack of San Francisco for the collec
tion of commissions aggregating some
$28,000, alleged to be due this county
from the State.
Both Bides had their turn at present
ing the case. The lawyers maintained
that Sacramento County had lost be
tween $25,000 and $30,000, and it would
continue to be out that sum if it per
mitted other counties to collect the
money due them while Sacramento re
mained inactive.
11. D. Stephens, a former Postmaster
of Sacramento and a prominent or
chardist, asserted that the proper way
would be to allow the District Attorney
to take the necessary steps for the col
lection of the money. Mr. Stephens in
sisted that the county would eventually
have to pay back in increased taxation
the money it received from the State,
plus about $12,000 as fees for the attor
neys holding the contract. On behalf
of the Chamber of Commerce Mr.
Stephens objected to the enforcement
of the contract.
J. H. Hayden of Sacramento Grange
declared that every member of the
Grange was opposed to the contract be
ing allowed to stand at the present
time. The Supervisors decided to await
an opinion from District Attorney
Baker, to be delivered on Wednesday
next, before taking action upon the re
quest for the rescinding of the con
tract.
Growing out of the sentiment which
The Call was instrumental in arous
ing, several legislators have in pre
paration a bill to be introduced simul
taneously in the Senate and Assembly,
the purpose of which is to prevent the
return of taxes paid by counties to the
State and to repeal the law allowing
commissions to county officers for the
collection of taxes. The law to be re
pealed Is the one approved March 9,
1593, authorizing the allowance of
claims against the State. The proposed
measure also provides that all 'actions
heretofore commenced or now pending
for the collection of money alleged to
be due the counties for services ren
dered in the assessment, equalization,
auditing and collection of ad valorem
taxes shall be dismissed by the court
in which the same may be pending.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 7.â The Board
of Supervisors of Marin County will
adopt a resolution next Monday re
scinding the contract entered into with
a legal firm to sue the State for com
missions for the collection of taxes in
the past. Attorney Hepburn "Wilkins
will appear before the Supervisors next
Monday and offer reasons why the
contract should not be rescinded. All
the members of the board are exceed
ingly bitter in their denunciations of
the San Francisco firm and allege that
the contract was secured by rank mis
representation of the facts; that they
were led to believe the money was al
ready in the State Treasury, when in
fact if the county should win its suit,
the money would have to come out of
the pockets of the taxpayers.

REDDING, Jan. 7.â With an ordinary
rainfall in the foothills and further
snowfall in the mountains until late
spring, it is estimated that Shasta
County's yield of precious metals will
exceed that of last year, which out
ranked the output of any county in the
State. This is accounted for by the
fact that for two seasons past the
placer yield of this county has been
next to nothing. While hundreds of
placer miners had prepared their plans
for an active season, the absence of
water made their development work in
vain. None of the miners take out in
the best of seasons what may be con
sidered a large amount, but the aggre
gate reaches quite a respectable figure.
This season they will be able to clean
up the result of several months' wash
ing if present weather prospects are
realized. It is estimated that the gold
yield, combined with the product and
by-product of copper mining, will
this year reach $2,500,000. Copper min
ing has not been interfered with by the
lack of rain, only by making operations
more expensive. The copper output
has been steadily growing in volume,
and a further Increase in smelting
facilities is projected. It is safe to say
that Shasta County will increase her
lead over other counties in the value of
mineral products.
In Trinity County an equally favor
able outlook is reported. Vast develop
ment work has been carried on in that
county by foreign and domestic com
panies operating hydraulic mines, and
for two seasons past the outlay of cap
ital has brought Inconsiderable re
turns by reason of lack of water. With
the heavy snowfall which came on New
Year's day mining men feel assured
that the gold yield of Trinity County
will be made to closely crowd $1,500,000.
Though it is not absolutely certain
that the recent great storm will pro
vide an abundance of water through
out the coming summer, the appear
ance of weather conditions Inspires
hope that more snow will fall on the
mountains and remain in unexposed
spots to feed the water channels sup
plying the gravel districts which yield
the bulk of Trinity's output.
In the mountains the thaw is imper
ceptible, and another snowstorm pre
vailed all of yesterday. During the
j same period a drizzling rain fell in
Redding.
MODESTO, Jan. 7.â Last night's
storm precipitated .63 of an inch of
rain. The total for the week is 1.35
inches, and for the season 3.53. The
weather still is threatening, and the
wind from the rainy quarter. Stanis
laus County, except west of the San
Joaquin River, is now in splendid con
dition, and the prospects for a big crop
were never brighter at this season of
the year than at present.
WALNUT CREEK, Jan. The rain
which fell during the last twenty-four
hours will make a total for the season
of 6.25 Inches, which la considerably
more than at last season to a similar
date.
SUISUN, Jan. 7.â From 4 o'clock yes
terday afternoon to noon to-day there
was a soaking downpour throughout
Solano County. The indications are
for another downpour to-night.
AUBURN, Jan. 7.â Rain commenced
falling last night and continues to fall
steadily. Snow fell as far down as
Dutch Flat, with a total of about ten
feet at Summit. Although miners were
made glad on New Year's day, they are
made happier to-day, for with plenty
of water for use in the summer months
the prospects for a big gold output are
very flattering.
STOCKTON, Jan. 7â The rainfall in
Stockton for the storm which com
menced on Friday evening measured
.46 of an inch, making 1.25 for the
month and 4.54 inches for the season,
against 3.31 inches this time last year.
The outlook is for more rain to-night.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 7.â Considerable rain
fell this morning, and there were sev
eral slight showers during the day and
evening. Prospects for a continuance
of the storm seem to be excellent. The
; farmers and fruit-growers are in ex
j ceedingly happy frame of mind and
consider that all fear of an unpro-
I pitious season have passed. The ground
j has received a good soaking, and the
j grass has an excellent start. For
j the storm, which commenced on Janu-
I ary 1, 1.60 inches have fallen, making a
total of 5.15 for the season.
I WOODLAND, Jan. 7.â A light rain
fall began about 6 o'clock last evening
and has continued ever since. The
precipitation is so gentle that not a
drop will run off or be wasted. The rain
is coming from the north, and the indi
cations are favorable for a good storm.
It is most opportune, and farmers and
fruit-growers are greatly encouraged
at the outlook for good crops.
MILTON, Jan. 7.â Twenty-six hun
dredths of an inch of rain fell here last
night. To-day the storm continued with
every prospect of a good soaking-. This
; vicinity has now been provided with an
abundance of rain for all the present
purposes. At Bloods place, in the Si
erra, near the eastern boundary of Cal
averas County, snow lies to a depth
of from ten to fifteen feet, varying; with
the locality. The melting of this body
of snow in the spring insures the mines
an abundance of water for the next
summer. Last winter the snowfall in
the highest Sierra was exceedingly
light, and consequently there were
many idle mines last summer.

MODESTO, Jan. 7.â At La Grange,
thirty miles east of Modesto, last even
ing, Mrs. Rose Morgan committed sui
cide by taking a dose of strychnine.
She was an old resident, 65 years of age.
She was the mother of Judge Charles

urer lost 11 and Aggeler for City Jus
tice gained 15. The latter needs only 10

city will be completed on Monday.A MOUNTAIN
SLIDES INTO
THE FRASER
Course of the River fil
tered by a Monstrous
Avalanche.
Seeding a New ChaoQel. Waters
InuQdate the fertile Nicola
Valley.
VANCOUVER, B. C, ran News was received here late this after
noon of a tremendous landslide near Pences Bridge, on I M Canadian Pa
cific Railway line. The recent - -._--â  had the effect of loosening almost half
of a small mountain which overhangs the Fraser River at this point. This
mountain has long been an object of curiosity* to travelers on account of
its peculiar position, its flat summit extending a considerable distance
over the river, which is very narrow at this place.
Yesterday people living in the vicinity noticed that an immense block of
the mountain had loosened. It appeared as though there was a crack which
: had almost divided the elevated and overhanging part in twain. Some of
the more cautious left their homes, fearing a repetition of the big Ashcroft
slide of several weeks ago.
Shortly after midnight last night, with a roar that cool 7 be heard for
â¢over a mile, fully a hundred acres of the hill, -..-where from twenty to
fifty feet, in depth, crashed Into the Fraser, damming it completely and
sending the water in a mad torrent over the fertile Nicola Valley. The course
' of the river was changed so completely that hundreds of dead Ssh. can now
be seen in the c.d river bed.
The oldest inhabitant hardly knows now -"where he is at," for the Fraser,
which, owing to the fiat nature of the country, has become a broad, majes
tic, -but shallow stream, is fully a half mile out of its course and joins the
old river bed at a considerable distance below the bridge.
Fcr miles around the ranchers and farmers were aroused by the noise
and shock incident to the slide. Fortunately the district is sparsely settled,
and no lives have been lost as far as is known. Barns and houses, however,
were caught in the flood and carried away, and hundreds upon hundreds
'of acres of valuable land will never be reclaimed from the muddy waters of
the Fraser In Its new course. The valley at this point is so deep that it has
been necessary to dyke a certain portion of it to prevent floods in the spring.
The present course of the river is directly through a large ranch owned by
John Cailand. which was in a high state of cultivation.
Full reports state it is feared the course of the flood caused by the slide
[.will take in several hamlets populated chiefly by miners. At the point where
the immense masses of earth dammed the river float ice has gathered and
, raised Itself high Into the air, an Imposing and picturesque sight. The col
' lapse*! mountain presents a Queer aspect and looks as though a huge charge
.of dynamite had been discharged near its now rugged summit.
The loss to property is not known, but it will not be very large. Some
-pf the best ranches In the district, it is reported, are being submerged. It
.Is mot known how the Canadian Pacific Railway, which crosses near this
point, fared. The oflicials are very reticent.

failed. Tbe race was heart-breaking I
from the start. Fredericks, Pierce, Tur- I

QUAY'S CHARGE OF
UNFAIRNESS ARGUED
Battle of tÂ£e Senator to Have the
Charges Against Him Carried

PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 7.â Argument
was heard in the State Supreme Court
to-day en the petition of United States
Senator Quay. P.ichard R. Quay and
former State Treasurer Haywood on the
petition for a writ of certiorari to re
move to the higher court fromthe Quar
ter Sessions Court of Philadelphia the
case pending against them charging
conspiracy.
The defendants are charged with con
spiracy with John S. Hopkins, former !
cashier of tbe defunct People's Bank, in
the alleged misuse of State funds on de
posit in that bank. In tbe petition the
defendants averred tbe belief that they
could not obtain a fair and impartial
trial in the Philadelphia County Court,
claiming that tbe dismissal of their de
murrers and other adverse decisions in !
the preliminary proceedings had dem
onstrated that there was prejudice
against them on the part of the trial
Judge (Finletter).
They also charged the Judge of the
county bench (Gordon with aiding in I
bringing the prosecution, and that the ,
latter was influenced by political en- '
mity and was unduly hastening the
trial of the case witb the object of" poi- ;
soning the minds of members of the
Legislature and thus defeating the re
election of United States Senator Quay.
Eloquent arguments were made to
day in support of the petition by At
torney David T. Watson of Pittsburg
and Rufus Sharpley of Philadelphia. :

District Attorney Graham-
Over three hoars were occupied in

BUT THE FRIEND OF ANARCH
ISTS IS MOST NOTICEABLE.
Heaps Abuse Upon the Heads of Re
" publicans and Compares
Bryan to Andrew
Jackson.
Special Dispatch to T_Â» Call-
OMAHA. Nebr., Jan. What the
members of the Jacksonian Club it this
city assert was the most successful
banquet they have ever held took place
to-night in the dining rooms of the
Paxton Hotel. Democrats from all
parts of the State were present, and
with them many leading Populists, in
cluding all the State officials. Ex-Gov
ernor Altgeld of Chicago, ex-Vice-
President Stevenson of Illinois and
Congressman Soil of New York as
the guests ft honor made the principal
addresses. 'Mr. Alt geld had as his sub
ject, "The Situation."
Mr. Altgeld began with the assertion
that the principles of republicanism
were being eliminated from the Gov
ernment and a moneyed aristocracy
was being enthroned. He said there was
a -and in high places for "Hamil
tonism." Then he went on to show that
Hamilton was an advocate of mon
archy, and that he always opposed
popular government. Altgeld con
tinued:
During tbe recent campaign Mr. Depew
came to Chicago under the auspices of
the Hamilton Club to deliver i partisan
address at the Auditorium. Federal Judge
Peter S. Grosscup mounted th rostrum
for tbe purpose of Introducing the orator,
and told tbe audience, among other
things, tbat ie light of Jefferson was
waningâ tbat on tbe dial plate of our na
tion's history this hour was Hamilton's,
that Hamilton's great Dam exactly fitted
these times, etc.
My friends, must we admit tbat Judge
Grosscup was right? Let us look around
again. The Senate of the great State cf
Ohio has just indicted a Hamiltonian
Senator for bribery and debauchery In
securing a high office. A Grand Jury in
Pennsylvania has just Indicted another
E___ilto_i__ Senator for robbing the
treasury of the State. Almost every great
trust appears to have one or more Hamil
tonian Senators as standing conveniences.
In the House of Representatives, where
the voice cf the people was supposed to be
beard, we rind the pensioned ri__r__3ter
of monopoly Stirling the voice of the peo
ple's representatives and reducing Repub
lican Congressmen to a condition of pity
and contempt.
TWO years ago a horde of Hamiltonian
statesmen went to the capita, of Illinois
and not only sold out the people, but
robbed tbe State of everything in sight.
Wherever you find dirty finger marks in
the temple of justice or a foul odor tn tbe
halls of legislation, there you will find
Hamlltonism. Verily, the spirit of Ham
ilton fits these times, but what shall we
say or* a judiciary tbat openly rejoices
over tbe fact that an era of corruption
has enveloped tbe land, tbat the betrayal
of tbe people baa become a science, and
tbat the robbing of the people has be
come a. fine art? And now we are to
widen the sphere of this class of states
men by giving tbem a chance to rob the
Filipinos. Heaven pity those poor peo
ple. Tbe Spaniard took what was in sight.
out the Hamlltonite, with his bond job
bery, enters the womb of the future and
plasters bis mortsraze on remote genera
tions.
Mr. Altgeld spoke of the maudlin talk
of an alliance with England, saying It
would be but repeating the story of tbe
lion and the lamb. Taking up the
financial question, claiming it to be tbe
basic and central question of the age,
he said that tbe ratio of 16 to 1 must
be adhered to as the opening of that
question would delay remonetization of
sliver for a century. He denounced
private monopoly a3 a crime, saym;*::
We must change our tactics and con
vert private monopolies Into public mo
nopolies. Give the whole public the bene
fits cf the monopoly instead of a few
Individuals. Let the Government take
them. This is not state socialism; it is
simp! protecting the people, and there
fore 13 democracy in its broadest sense.
The European people fight -socialism, but
get the greatest benefits from collective
ownership.
He declared in favor of municipal
ownership of such monopolies as ga?.
water and street railway systems and
Government ownership of raUroads.
Said Mr. Altgeld:
Tears ago I wrote some articles Earor
ing governmental control or regulation
of railroads, but not ownership. Obser
vation has satisfied me this Is all futile.
Instead of a board regulating the cor
porations the corporations regulate the
board. And if they run against an honest
board some friendly Judge flies to their res
cue and kicks the bo.-. clear off the high
way. At present there seems to be no way
of protecting tbe public and restoring to
the people their government, except by
having the eminent own the' rail
roads. .As between having the corpora
tion own the Government or having the
Government own the corporation, the
American people will prefer the latter.
He closed his address with a eulogy
upon Jackson, ending with these words:
"Amid temptation and threats of de
struction he fixed his eye on the star
of justice, shook his fist in the face of
power and delivered the American neo
pie. This country needs more Andrew
Jacksons and the people believe that
they have found one in William J.
Bryan."
COLLECTING TAXES I_l CUBA.
The Spanish System to Be Continued
for a Tims.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.â The War
Department has finally decided to con
tinue in force for a time, at least, the
system of collecting taxes In Cuba prac
ticed by the Spanish authorities, but
with some important changes made in
the plan in the direction of liberality
toward the taxpayers and in the hon
esty of administration. The plan is
embodied in a general order which was
promulgated â  by the War Department
to-day. It Is a noticeable fact that the
burden of collection, amounting to 5
per cent of the tax, is now assumed by
the Government instead of being im
posed upon the taxpayers, while the
heavy 10 per cent Increase in taxation,
which was levied as one of the last acts
of the Spanish administration. Is re
mitted, as well as all accrued penalties,
the prevision being made that penalties
shall not be enforced on taxes now de
linquent if payment shall be made by
February 28 next.

the Old Flag and an Appropri
ation" as Good as the
2_entuc_ian _.
Special ______ to The Call.
DENVER, Jan, 7.â The annual cele
bration of Jackson day was held by the
Jacksonlan Club at Weir's Hall to
night, several hundred members of the
club and their guests being present.
The principal event of the â  mime was
an address by Governor-elect Charles
S. Thomas of Colorado.
Governor-elect Thomas, In the course
of his address, replied to the recent
editorial of Henry Watterson in the
Louisville-Courier Journal, in which the
latter suggested that Admiral Dewey
and General Fltah-gh Lee be made the
Democrat. nominees for 1900, with the
platform "The Stars and Stripes. God
Bless Them." Governor Thomas said
urt:
Bourbon density is said to be proverb
ial. It polarizes in tho political atmos
phere of gold Democracy, which blandly
assumes that the national organization
Is ready to toss the reins from the driv
er's box to those whom the vehicle but
yesterday ran over. *'Old horse sense
sitting ln the rocker," is dilapidated when
it assert 3 either that the economic issues
of the last campaign are obsolete, or that
the leadership of tbat time is not the
leadership of IS9_. It may be that ln 1300
Democracy will find inspiration in the
name of the great admiral; it may be
tbat the events of the ensuing period will
point to him as Its loarical candidate; it
may be tbat General Lee. or some other
conspicuous military figure, wiil stand as
his associate, but these conditions must
come if at all not tbat the bolters of
"_*}â¢> may be persuaded to return; not that
their views or opinions must be accepted,
but that through such leadership the
principles of tbe Chicago rdatform may
be effective and enduring.
But if tt be true that political platforms
are formulated by political hypocrites and
Eredestined to abandonment, and tbat
â¢emocracy's sole pledge for 1300 should
be "Tbe Stars and Stripes, Good Bless
Them," what assurance can we give that
any pledge Involved even ln such a
catch-phra_e will not be disregarded?
If we have lost all devotion to our party
principles and our political duty Is formed
to resorting to any device which promises
victory, it were better to adopt Colonel
Sellers' platform and "Go In for the old
flag and an- appropriation." This has
some practical meaning and in sentiment
It Is fully equal to its more graceful but
not less attractive Wattersonian Imita
tion.
We are warned that the Republican
leaders are not going. to handicap them
selves with a.-- ancient party rubbish.
Hence it is argued that we should not
only Imitate but surpass them tn our de
sertion of party principles. We are told
that at the opportune moment McKinley
and Wheeler will march down to the
footlights to tbe tune of The Land We
Love," or words to that effect. If nation
al politics have descended to the song
and dance level of negro minstrelsy, then
one set of end men will serve as well as
another. We a- not concerned with the
names of the performers if the song and
jig be satisfactory.
The men to whose keeping tbe fortunes
of our party were committed by Its last
convention believe tbat its declarations
mean something. They do not estimate
its principles by tbe changing currents of
public sentiment, of the shifting stand
ards cf expediency. They are building,
not for to-day, nor for a generation, but
for all time. To them defeat in 1300 means
delay, but net disaster.
Governor Thomas was followed by
Hon. Tyson SJ Dines of Denver in an
address on the battle of New Orleans.
DESIRABLE EXPANSION
OF LOCAL INDUSTRY
Valuable Invention ls Fire Eesist
ant, Elastic and Expedites Work.
Used in Many Promi
nent Buildings.
The expansion of oar local Industries
is more Important to California than the
acquisition of new possessions. An In
teresting move In this direction is the
manufacture of Hartman'a electric mor
tar and dryer in this city. Mr. McKen
drick. the proprietor, ts a practical me
chanic who has devoted years to per
fecting i composition for making com
mon lime mortar hard and durable.
The main advantage la that the mortar }
combined with the hardener will set in
from forty-eight to seventy-two hours.
From a sanitary view also It is Import
ant for the reason that time is. one of the
best disinfectants, and the*,- hardened
mortar becomes non-absorbent. It Is
also elastic, preventing tbe cracking of
plastering, allowing for the iking
and swelling o* wood lath.
A striking proof of Its value as i fire
resistant was seen at the recent Bald
win Hotel fire, where piastering tem
pered with this hardener was subjected
to a heat of 2000 negroes Fahrenheit, re
maining unaffected by it.
"I have used the hardener in numerous
buildings," said M. J. Lyons, the archi
tect, * "among others the Mount "ion Hos
pital and the Meyer building. Third and
Stevenson atreets. I am well satisfied
with tt. It saves time and money. It
saves about two week-' time in the con
struction of a butldtng. A great advan
tage is that tn sand-finish plaster it gives
a perfectly hard surface, avoiding the
common defect of sand finish, disintegra
tion."
Hermann & Swain, architects, have used
the hardener in several prominent build
ings, the residence of Hermann - Shatn
wald, Plymouth Hotel and the new store
of M. A. mat. '"It gives great satisfac
tion," said Mr. Hermann. "Among other
advantages It is especially valuable tn
hurrying tha work ln case of repairs."
Shea _; Shea have employed the har
dener In the Langham Hotel, the resi
dence of Father Cottle of St. Brigtd'a
Church and are now using it in Holy
Cross Church.
"It Is very valuable, said _Ir. Shea.
"giving ordinary extra-rigidity, particu
larly on metal lathing. It is also elastic
and saves money, owing to it 3 rapid set

CHICAGO, Jan. 7.â The third annual
banquet of the Andrew Jackson League
was held at the Tremont House here
to-night, and on this occasion, as on th;
two former, William J. Bryan was the ;
guest of honor. The banquet halls of
the hotel were turned into a sea of
bunting caught up with festoons of j
smilax. Life-size portraits of Jackson
and of the guest of tbe evening were |
hung in opposite ends of tbe hall, these j
being tbe only portraits used in the |
decorations. Mayor Carter H. Harrison j
of Chicago acted as presiding officer, j
and with Mr. Bryan were Congressmen '
Lents of Ohio and Hinricbsen of Illinois, j
Mayor Maybury of Detroit, Mayor Rose
of Milwaukee, Mayor Taggart of In
dlanapolls, William F. McKnlght of j
Grand Rapids, Charles K. Ladd of Ke- j
wanee, 111., Captain William P. Black
and National Committeeman Thomas â 
Gab a of Illinois.
The exercises of the evening were
opened witb a short address by Mayor
Harrison, who. before he resumed his
seat, introduced as the first apeak of
the evening Congressman Hinricbsen,
who spoke in response to the toast
"Party Fealty." Congressman Lent
explained to his hearers "What Makes
a President Great."
Captain William P. Black of Chicago
followed, responding to the toast of
"Tbe Soldiery of the Republic." Then
came the three visiting Mayors, ...
three making brief talks.
William F. McKnlght of Michigan
then spoke on"The Young Democracy,"
and tbe address of Mr. Bryan closed
tbe evening. Bryan said in part:
Tbe Democracy of tbe nation Is still de
fending Jeffersonian principles with
J_c__a_i_n courage and has no thought
of departing from the principles enun
ciated at Chicago in __6. Tbat platform
wiil live In history and the hour of It
adoption will be remembered -- the hour
when the money-changers were driven
from tbe Democratic temple. There will
be no turning back. The platform will
be added to as new conditions force new
issues into the arena of politics, but noth
ing will be subtracted from.it. Events
have vindicated every position taken by
the platform. Some who opposed tne plat
form in ls'J'i have promised to return to
the party on condition that the party
drop the money question and confine the
tight to the trusts. __â  offer will not be
accepted. What confidence would the peo
ple have in our sincerity if we should de
clare against trusts in general but enter
Into a treaty of peace with the greatest
of ail trustsâ the money trust? I- we
should attempt to center the fight on the
trusts the Republicans would adopt as
strong an anti-trust plank as we because
no party would dare to defend the trusts.
The Gold Democrats bad an opportunity
to crush out tbe trusts during .vir. Cleve
land's administration, but they did not do
it. The Gold Republicans are having their
opportunity now, but they are not Im
proving It. The trusts will fall when tbe
gold standard Is overthrown, and not un
til then. Tbe second point of attack is
tbe ratio. Why insist upon IS to 1? they
ask. I reply first, because It is the best
ratio, and, second, because its opponents
have no other ratio to offer. Our party
cannot ignore the issues raised by the
war. It must speak out against ___-
tarism now or forever bold its peace. A
large standing army Is not only in ex
pense to tbe people but it is a menace to
the nation, and tne Democratic party will
be a unit in opposing it.
A word In regard to imperialism. Those
who advocate the annexation of the Phil
ippines caii themselves expansionists, but
they are really imperialists. The word
expansion would describe the acquisition
of territory to be populated by homo
geneous people and to be carved Into
states like those now In existence. An
empire suggests variety in race and di
versity tn government. The Imperialists
do not desire to clothe the Filipinos with
all the rights and privileges of American
citizenship; they want to exercise sov
ereignty over an alien race, and they ex
pect to rule the new subjects upon a the
ory entirely at variance with constitu
tional government. "Victoria is Queen of
Great Britain and Empress of India.
Shall we change the title of our execu
tive and call him the President of the
United States and Emperor of the Phil
ippines?
What excuse can be given for the adop
tion of a colonial policy.* Secretary Gag*
disclosed the secret in his Savannah
speech. I think we might be justified ln
calling Mr. Gage the keyhole of the ad
ministration because we look through him
to learn what Is going on within the ex
ecutive council chamber. He suggested
that "philanthropy and 5 per cent" would
go hand In hand in the new venture.
These are the two arguments which are
always used in favor of conquest. Phil
anthropy and 5 per cent. The one chloro
forms ths conscience of the conqueror
and the other picks the pocket of the
conquered.
Some say that philanthropy demands
that we govern the Filipinos for their
own good, while others assert that we
must hold the islands because of the pe
cuniary profit to be derived from them.
I deny the soundness of both arguments.
Forcible annexation will not only be
criminal aggression (to borrow Mr Ke-
Klnley's language of a year ago), but it
will cost more than it is worth, and the
whole people will pay the cost while a few
will reap alt the benefits. Still weaker 13
the argument based upon religious duty.
The Christian religion rests upon the
doctrine of vicarious suffering and atone
ment: the colonial policy rests upon the
doctrine of vicarious enjoy:

NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â A Tribune spe

William K. Vanderbilt Jr. will not re
turn to Harvard. He had not come
back from his Christmas vacation and
an announcement that came to-day of
his decision not to return was not a

be that his father wants his assistance

The Tammany Chief's Declaration for

Special Dt3_atch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Mr. Richard Croker has
stirred up a hornets' nest among Demo
crats in Congress. His emphatic decla
rations in favor of the policy of expan
sion and against silver at 1-5 to 1 have
aroused antis and Bryanites to a real
ization of the fact that Tammany's In
fluence will be exerted against the anti
expansion policy and against free sil
ver.
It has tended to widen still .-her
the breach between Eastern Democrats
and those of the West and South. Many
of the leading men in Mr. Bryan - fol
lowing assume to make light of tha
matter, but the bitterness of their com
ments shows they realize that Mr.
Croker has struck a severe blow at
their faction by declaring for expan
sion, a large army and navy and
affair.- the doctrine of free coinage.
"The candidates for the Democratic
leadership in the House whose votes
will be especially interesting in view of
Mr. Croker's action in putting Mr. Sul
zer forward for the leadership will not
discuss the ma* for publication. This
may be accounted for by the fact tbat
Mr. Sulzer's candidacy is not taken
seriously in spite of Mr. Croker's deter
mination to push him for the honor,
and each of the other candidates hopes
to obtain support from New York in
the event of Mr. Sulzer withdrawing.
Representative Bailey of Texas, the
present leader, had not read Mr.
Croker's statement. I handed it to him.
He read it carefully and then smiled
blandly and said: "I have nothing to
say." . ,

DOCTOR SWEANY'S
COMBINED TREATMENT
-OF THE GREAT CURATIVE POWERS^,
ht^zs^J^y Q ' â¢ %__*s\_^feip^ 3L/^
Don't use drugs says a doctor who ha-* only electricity to offer. Don't
use electricity another would say who has only drugs to offer.
Each would speak the truth in some cases, and yet in many cases both
would advise wrongly, simply because medicine will cure ln many cases
" where electricity will only give temporary relief, and in a few cases electric-
ity properly administered may effect a cure where medical treatment
would fall. So it is with electricity cr medicine when used alone.
Reader, did it ever occur to you tbat Dr. Sweanys Electro-Medical
Treatment 'will cure nearer 100 per cent of all cases than any other system
of treatment known to the world? Dies it not appeal to your intelligence
that the curative powers of tbe two scientifically combined will accom-
plish more than either if used alone? If you want quick results *_> cure
without delay or failure, apply to Dr. Sweany's offices and get the combined
benefit of both medical and electrical treatment and be assured that by this
combined treatment, as administered by the direction of this capable spe-
cialist, you will obtain immediate results more reaching in its effects,
quicker more satisfactory and permanent cures. You can also understand
that by means of this combined treatment difficult cases can be cured where
all other known means have failed.
lf you cannot call at Dr. Sweany's offices for treatment, send at once for
his ELECTRO-MEDICAL BELT. The first and onlty combined electro-
medical belt ever made. It is the product of this competent and ever pro-
gressive specialist, who stands far ahead of any in the matter of scientific,
skillful and successful methods of treating and curing the sick and suffer-
ing. The be:* will give you the benefit at once of both electricity and medi-
cation. This beit has a patent regulator so that you can r-gutate the cur-
rent, making it strong or weak as the case may require. It has also aa
I improved scrotal electrode which will carry as much current into and
through the sexual organs as can be tolerated. The medicated part of the
belt is interposed between the electrodes and comes directly to contact with
the surf.- of the body; the medical virtues are taken up and absorbed
into the system by "Osmotic Action." Hence you get at once and the same
time the full effects of both electrical and medical treatment, and the bene-
fits you will derive will be TWO FOLD, relief will be distinctly felt at once
and the results desired will be doubly satisfactory.
Remember that Dr. Sweany is not established here for the sole purpose
0 ; selling belts and appliances, but It is his purpose to cure the sick and
suffering of all kinds and classes and to offer to the people a pleasant, con*
venient and doubly successful means of obtaining relief and cure of their
many diseases and ailments. So, reader, if you are a sufferer and cannot
call at his offices, send JlO at once and receive one of his electro-medical
belts. You will never regret it, for by so doing you will place yourself
fairly on the highway to complete health and happiness, as you will then
practically be under the care and treatment of the moat successful special-
ist, whom you can consult at any time, either personally or by letter, free of
charge. This electro-medical belt is neat, clean and not cumbersome and
may be worn day and night, or only at night. WORKS WHILE YOU
SLEEP!
There are two classes of diseases wherein the combined* electro-medical
treatment accomplishes wonderful results: First, to the class of diseases
termed neurasthenia. In other words, nervous debility, especially of men, re-
sulting from any cause whatever, either from youthful follies or subse-
quent excesses causing breaking down of the kidneys, sexual organs, sto-
mach, heart and the whole nervous _ystem. Second, in the many distress-
ing and nervous ailments peculiar to women. If all of those men and wo-
men who have suffered long and have perhaps met with repeated failures in
their efforts to get well would try this electro-medical treatment, or send for
an electro-medical belt, I dare say nothing on earth could prevent them
from pursuing a full course of treatment with com*; and Joyful restora-
tion to perfect health.
Write if you cannot call at offices. A valuable book, "Guide to Health,"
sent free of charge. Address.
F\ L. SIA/EANY, M. D.,
1 737 MARKET ST., San Francisco, Cat
of the National Democratic Committee,
said that he had not read Mr. Croker',
statement although he had heard in a
general way the substance of his ut
terances, which were doubtless expect
ed to influence certain Democratic Sen
ators. Senator Jones said he did not
have to go to Mr. Croker for advice or
counsel on the one- of expansion.
Senator Jones -aid. as chairman at the
National Democratic Committee he
was In constant correspondence with
leading Democrats in ail parts of the
country, and therefore was able to
form a pretty fair estimate of Demo
cratic sentiment, not only on the sub
ject of territorial expansion, but also
on the financial question. There was
x division of opinion among leaders of
the party, he admitted, as to the wis
dom of extend the territorial limits
of the United States so as to include
the Philippines.
Commenting on Mr. Croker's state
ment that the free sliver issue at ths
ratio of 16 to 1 Is dead. Senator Jones
said he was not surprised that Mr.
Croker should make such a state
"For," said he. "Mr. Cro__r*i vision on
such questions does not extend beyond
the limits of New York City. Those
gentlemen who are pronouncing eulo*
gies on the death of free silver may be
disappointed when the next Democratic
National Convention meets. I happen
to be in a position to know that free
silver as a Democratic Issue Is not
dead, neither is it sleeping, and I am
confident there will be a reaflirmatlon
of so much of the Chicago platform aa
declares for the free and unlimited
coinage of silver. There may be a slight
modification as to the ratio, but the
Democratic party is overwhelmingly
loyal to the free silver cause. The
question of expansion will hardly cut
any figure In the next national cam
paign, for in my opinion a fixed line
of policy will have been established in
that direction before the next Presi
dential campaign opens."

BOTH HOUSES MET '
ONLY TO ADJOURN
CALL " HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â Lieutenant Governor
Ne_ looked down from his chair on
empty seats this morning when he rap
ped for order In the Senate. Not a
quorum of the solons was present and
no business could have been done even
if there had been any to do. He con
tented himself with calling for a session
on Monday morning and announcing that
by agreement no bills would be intro
duced for consideration until Tuesday
afternoon at 2 o'clock, after the first bal
lot for United States Senator had been
taken. The same hour has been fixed
in the Assembly.
Alden Anderson, Speaker pro tern.,
called the Assembly to order and the
subsequent roll-call developed that a
quorum was on the floor, though, as in
the case of the Senate, there was nothing
for it to do but adjourn to Tuesday
morning. _'
Contrary to the prearranged plan,
Speaker Wright did not announce the
standing committees of the Assembly, nor
will he until Tuesday, and when he does
there will be numerous changes from the
lists published in the papers of this morn
ing. The more Important committees will
remain as they are, though there is a
powerful influence at work to force
changes in some of them, particularly in
the Committee on Public Buildings, upon
which every one of the San Francisco
delegation is and has been fighting to get
a place. The changes to occur will be
confined to the smaller and less important
committees, and will not materially
change the political aspect of any of
them. â¢ : .
Speaker Wright did not take the chair
to-day, as he was scarcely fit to do busi
ness at all. The hard work and worry of
the past two weeks have brought him to
the verge of nervous prostration, and he
left on the 2 o'clock train this afternoon
for Berkeley for a couple of days of rest.
When he returns he will be accompanied
by Mrs. Wright, and they will, of course,
attend the inaugural ball.
The only, talk that Is doing here to-day
among the few legislators who haven't
gone home is on the probability of a Sen
atorial caucus. All this morning the
tyrant people were out sizing up the
strength and sounding the majority mem
bers to see whether or not a caucus
would be a safe thing to monkey with,
me Burns people have been doing the
same thing, but not as openly as have
the friends of the San Dlegan. If a cau
cus ,is held the first joint ballot will take
Place ln the Assembly chamber at pre
cisely noon Tuesday. If a caucus Is not
held the programme is to effect the sep
arate ballots in Senate and Assembly on
luesday and have the first joint ballot
at Wednesday noon.
After the first ballot on Tuesday,
whether it be joint or otherwise, an ava
lanche of bills will follow in both houses.
Orove L. Johnson of Sacramento has a
whole deskful of them, Cobb of the San
Francisco delegation has another and
Kadcliffe of Santa Cruz has a half dozen
_* a 5, to crowd in first on the file. Among
Kadcliffe's bills Is one that is of particu
lar Interest to his county.
It provides for the creation and main
iii"" ns of a camp ground for the State
militia at Laveaga Park, one of the most
beautiful spots in the vicinity of the City
of the Cross. The park Is the property of
the city, a legacy from the late Jose Vi
cente de Laveaga, and Its use as a camp
ground will be freely given by the mu
nicipality.
The outgoing 2 o'clock train left scarce
a score of the members of either house
in town, and legislative matters bid fair
to be anything but swift during the next
forty-eight hours.
FIRST WEEK OF THE
SENATORIAL FIGHT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. The forces of the vari
ous Senatorial candidates have now been
in the field one week, yet the situation
Is practically the same as It was at the
time of the assemblylng of the Legisla
ture. Members have been pulled and
hauled, cajoled, caressed and threatened
and here at the end of the week the op
posing forces can count noses without
marking any losses or accessions in the
ranks of their followers.
The Grant men lay claim to the ac
quirement of several votes, but the claim
is not borne out in its essential details.
The Burns forces are still claiming ev
erytning in sight, but, strange to say,
they have no more votes in sight than
they had when they came to Sacramento
last Sunday. What they had then was
less than half of the number required to
elect a United States Senator and so, nat
urally enough, there is no undue hilarity
in the Burns camp. Bulla and Barnes
and Knight profess entire satisfaction
over the result of the week's work, a fact
that leads naturally to the inference that
they are easily satisfied.
The Paterson, Beale and Bard booms
seem to have died a natural death.
The one principal fact that has been de
veloped by the first week of Senatorial
skirmishing Is that there is not a single
candidate ln the field who has the posi
tive promise of more than half as many
votes as are needed to elect him. Condi
tions are such that there will be no ma
terial change ln the situation between
now and next Tuesday, the time fixed by
law for the taking of the first ballot for
Senator. A deadlock, which will last
indefinitely, is likely to be the result.
That the expected deadlock will not ex
tend over a greater period than one week
is the expressed belief of the wiser ones
among the legislators and politicians as
sembled at the capital, but political signs
are more susceptible to misconstruction
than other brands, and there is no one
who dares to make a positive prediction
as to when the .end will come.
There are to-day many outward and
visible signs that the "sack" of one or
more of the Senatorial candidates has ar
rived. Burns' lieutenants, many of whom
are San Francisco political bums and
heelers, who are known in the metropolis
as men who are constantly in need of a
square meal and a decent suit of clothes,
are each Jingling a pocketful of double
eagles and playing the bountiful host to
legislators.
The men buzz in and out of Burns'
headquarters like bees in a hive, and their
presence cumbers the hotel lobbies, the
sidewalks and the barrooms. It is a
motley crew, but they have money and
as long as they are willing to spend It
they are tolerated by needy legislators
and the friends and well-wishers of some
who are not needy, but greedy. Of the
lot, there is not one who could influence
a vote, except, perhaps, by the use of
money. Even this last contingency is
extremely doubtful, for the legislator who
can be bought prefers to do business with
principals and not with hired agents, who
are so disreputable that they have not
the confidence of their immediate asso
ciates.
It is reported that the Grant "sack" ar
rived in town to-day from the south. Ru
mor also has it that the string will be
cut to-morrow or the next day, and from
that time on wine will flow like water
and the highest market price wil lbe paid
for Senatorial votes. How much truth
there is In those rumors does not appear,
nor is it possible to explain how it hap
pened that they were started at the mo
ment of arrival from Los Angeles of W.
H. Baker, who comes to lend aid and
comfort to the Grant boomers.
Baker enjoys the reputation of being
one of the shrewdest politicians in the
southern country, and It is certain that
he is one of the select few who are
charged with the conduct of Mr. Grant's
campaign. He arrives here at a critical
moment, for prospective votes are scat
tered on account of the three days' re
cess taken by the Legislature, and the
time must be employed in arranging for
the final struggle before the taking of the
initial ballot for Senator.
It is very evident that the Grant people
have a well-marked plan of action in
view. If, as seems certain, they intend
to attempt to influence the result by tho
use of money, either directly or indirect
ly, the preparations that have been made
could not have been better. Many of tho
men who are promoting the candidacy of
Grant have been connected with almost
every disreputable political job that has
been" perpetrated during the past ten
years, and their knowledge of the most
approved methods of salving a lacerated
conscience with ready money is not to be
denied. Some of the gentlemen who are
promoting the candidacy of the San
Diegan are wholly reputable and are
above suspicion.
The other class, composed of political
tricksters and social outcasts, are to be
accounted for only by the supposition
that they are employed to do the dirty
work that is evidently considered neces
sary to Grant's success.
As might have been expected, since the
announcement that Assemblyman Clough
favored Burns came from the Examiner
the prentleman enters denial. He is not
for Dan, never has been and never will
be. His first choice is Barnes, whose
nomination he will second. If the devel
oping situation indicates the wisdom of
electing a, man from the south, he has
not decided to whom his vote will go,
but it will go to the available candidate
of that section. ' There can be no exi
gency which can win Clough to the Burns
push.
NO CAUCUS WILL BE
HELP ON SENATOR
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â There will be no caucus
of Republican Assemblymen and Senators
on the Senatorial question for the present.
Not until after several ballots have been
taken and the several candidates have
made a showing of their strength will it
be "possible to secure the signatures neces
sary for the calling of a caucus.
The touts and politicians who are hand
ling the Burns fight under the direction
of the man from Mexico went abroad to
day and mingled with the Republican
members of the Legislature for the pur
pose of ascertaining whether or not it
would be feasible to hold a joint Sena
torial caucus on Monday evening or
Tuesday morning. It took about two
hours to ascertain that it would be im
possible to hold , any caucus prior to the
faking of the first ballot, and even after
that it may be difficult to secure the sig
natures of every Republican member of
the Senate and Assembly to a call.
It is quite evident that Burns' mana
gers were desirous of forcing a caucus,
but when they found that it was Impossi
ble they promptly dropped the idea and
gave out the announcement that they
were not in favor of anything of the kind.
The managers of Senator Bulla's cam
paign absolutely declined to consider the
proposition for a caucus for a moment.
One of the prominent members of the
Assembly, who is to the front in Bulla's
fight, in talking about the caucus call this
evening, said: "No sir; we refused to sign
any call now and we do not Intend to at
any time. There never; will be any cau
cus action as far as the Republicans are
concerned In this Senatorial fight. Even
if one was secured I know of at least
twenty members who would not be bound
by Its "action. Under these circumstances
of what value would a caucus action be?
The proposition was made to us to con
sent to one being held, but we declined
absolutely to consider it for a moment."
James, Brown, who Is to the front in the
management of the Grant campaign,
when asked about the probability of a
caucus this evening, said: "There will
never be any caucus. The Bulla people
will never consent to It, and while Burns
and his friends attempted to create the
Impression that they would be willing to
have one held, as a matter of fact they
do not."
The truth of the matter is that a cau
cus at this Juncture would not be produc
tive of any results that would tend to
clear away the mist that at present sur
rounds the Senatorial battle. None of the
leading candidates could possibly secure
a vote in the caucus sufficiently decisive
to overwhelm the opposition and to cause
the Republican members to accept tne
caucus action and follow it on the floor
when tho two houses meet in joint ses
sion to ballot.
BURNS HENCHMEN TRY TO
MANUFACTURE BACKBONE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â Orders were sent out
from the Burns headquarters to-day to
various points throughout the State to
all the Burns push to proceed at once
to make an effort to create sentiment, or
at least to make a showing, which would
give weak-kneed Assemblymen and Sena
tors who contemplated voting for Mexican
Dan on Tuesday ground to stand on.
These instructions to the Burns push in
the interior were to have telegrams sent
from as many Assembly and Senatorial
districts throughout the State as they
possibly can to Sacramento at once.
They are to be addressed to the Assem
blymen and Senators, and are to be
requests to vote for Burns for Senator.
As many signatures as possible are to be
obtained to be affixed to these dispatches.
As to the character of the signers, no in
structions were given.
The Burns people apparently realize the
fact that many of their supporters, after
they have cast their ballots for the man
from Mexico, are going to have brought
down upon their heads a veritable thun
der storm from outraged constituents.
Knowing this to be the case the wily col
onel and his friends are doing all they
can to protect them from the violence of
the storm that Is now certain to come.
Colonel Burns has already selected the
Senator and Assemblyman who will place
him in nomination in the two houses.
He Is not yet prepared to announce their
names, Taut will do so on Monday. The
name of the Senator who will place the
colonel's name, before the upper branch
of the Legislature when it is made public
will greatly surprise the public, for he is
now believed to be a stanch supporter of
Grant.
Senator Bulla had the busiest day of
any Senatorial candidate. He was In his
headquarters from early morning until
midnight, receiving visitors and reports
from his workers. Edwin A. Meserve,
chairman of the last Republican County
Convention of Los Angeles County, and
E. E. Crandall, a prominent business man,
arrived from the south, and will be here
to help Bulla until the fight is over. Mr.
Meserve states that he comes to Sacra
mento to assist Senator Bulla, because
under the instructions of the convention
of which he was chairman he believes it
his duty to do so. That convention, he
claims, instructed its legislative nominees
unqualifiedly for Bulla, and there was no
drawback to the resolutions. Â»
W. R. Bacon and James Meredith, two
well-known Los Angeles Republicans, also
arrived to-night, and are in the fight for
Grant. ."'
Frank Miller of Riverside also came in
to-night, and called at Senator Bulla's
headquarters. Mr. Miller does not know
exactly where he does stand on the Sena
torial question, but he is Inclined to favor
Bulla.
LOS ANGELENOS NOT
PLEASED WITH GAGE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â The Los Angeles people
who are here, and as to numbers they are
not small, are by no means favorably
impressed with the attitude Governor
Gage has placed himself in ln the Sena
torial fight.
The friends of Senator Bulla do not talk
much, for the Governor has condescend
ed to state that he will not do anything
to injure Bulla's candidacy. For this
manifestation of kindly spirit toward Bul
la the friends of that gentleman are
thankful. They remember that for about
thirty days and thirty nights they put
in their time persuading the voters of Los
Angeles County to vote for "our Henry"
for Governor, and now "our Henry" has
given them a strong manifestation of his
gratitude by consenting to permit Bulla
to remain in the field as a candidate and
turning over to Colonel Daniel M. Burns
for his personal use the power and influ
ence and patronage of the State admin
istration with which to make his fight
for the Senatorship.
Of course, the Bulla men are not out in
the open making any vigorous statements
about the Governor's ingratitude, but
they are doing a lot of thinking. He tells
them that he is not assisting Colonel
Burns in his fight, and they say nothing
to him in reply. But at the same time,
the Bulla men wonder whether or not
Governor Gage, great man that he is,
gives them credit for the possession of
ordinary common-sense. If he does, then
they wonder why he attempts to deceive
them with the silly misstatement that he
is doing nothing to aid the Senatorial can
didacy of Colonel Burns.
There is one Los Angeles man who is
very hold and outspoken in his opinion of
Governor Gage and the declaration made
by the Governor that he would take the
act of any member of the Legislature in
voting for Grant as a personal affront to
him. That man is T. E. Gibbon, vice
president of the. Terminal Railway. Mr.
Gibbon stated at the Golden Eagle to-day
that he had discussed the matter with a
number of the members of the Legisla
ture and that they were all highly Indig
nant at the dictatorial attitude the execu
tive had assumed toward the legislative
branch of the State government. Mr.
Gibbon stated that several members had
Informed him that if the Governor con
tinued in his course and attempted to
Interfere with the legislative arm as he
had In the past they were in favor of in
stituting proceedings for impeachment.
Mr. Gibbon stated that in his opinion
such action would be justifiable if Gage
felt it incumbent upon himself to go
much further.
This statement Mr. Gibbon made in the
cafe of the Golden Eagle in the presence
of several of the Governor's friends, and
for a time it created a very warm dis
cussion.
GENERAL BARNES IS
AGAIN AT THE CAPITAL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â General W. H. L,
Barnes, accompanied by Theodore Reich
ert and A. G. Booth, his lieutenants, ar
rived in Sacramento to-night prepared to
again take up the battle for Senatorial
honors. The trio repaired immediately to
their headuarters in the Golden Eagle and
were welcomed by the general's followers.
The general's quick return caused great
surprise around the hotel, as it was
understood that when he left Friday
night he would not return until Monday.
The fact that his opponents had not left
the battle-ground may have had some ef
fect in bringing him back so quickly.
Dr. C. C. O'Donnell also arrived on the
same train and registered at the Golden
Eagle. The", doctor said he intended re
maining here until Tuesday next and
would attend the sessions of the Legisla
ture. He says, however, that the object
of his visit is "professional business."
SAN DIEGO REPUBLICANS
INDIGNANT AT TREACHERY
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 7.â The feeling among
Republicans in San Diego is at white
heat against Henry T. Gage for his so
called treachery and baseness in attack
ing U. S. Grant. There are Republicans
here who deliberately accuse Gage and
Burns of â  a conspiracy dated since last
October, when Burns visited Los Angeles.
This feeling culminated in the circulation
ot the following statement to-day:
"We, Republicans of San Diego County,
who took an active part in the last cam-
I paign, deny the alleged statement of
j Governor Gage to the effect that he was
| traded or knifed. Good, honst hard
work was done for Gage, and his vote
I here, considered with other State candi
! dates, challenges comparison with that
! received in Los Angeles, his own home,
! where his plurality was far less than that
I of six State candidates, as well as that of
Congressman, and where the plurality of
Reeves for State Treasurer, the other
State candidate from Southern Califor
nia, was almost double that of Gage.
"Grant's efforts here, In our judgment,
gave Gage a majority which otherwise he
would not have received, and we, as
Republicans, deplore the alleged state
ment of our Governor, which, if made by
him, is an unjust reflection not alone upon
the political integrity of Mr. Grant,
but is an Insult to the Republican party
of this county."
This statement is signed by Major D. C.
Reed, every Republican county officer,
which Includes all but one In the county,
city officials, members of the Republican
county campaign committee and the
prominent Republicans. There was also
some talk of holding an indignation meet
ing to repudiate Governor Gage's utter
ances regarding Grant, but public feeling
was so intense that it was feared too rad
ical action would be taken. The county
campaign committee adopted vigorous
resolutions, which have been wired to
Governor Gage and the press.
FREE TICKETS TO THE
BALL AT A MINIMUM
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â lf the members of the
Governor's staff desire to attend the In
augural ball it will be necessary for them
to pay for their tickets. They will re
ceive no compllmentartes.
This evening, for the third time, an at
tempt was made to prevail upon the exec
utlve committee having in charge the ar
rangements for the Inaugural ball to Issue
to them complimentary tickets, but for
the third time the committee declined
to do so. General W. T. Sheehan, who is
a member of the executive committee,
when the matter come up at the meeting
to-night, vigorously opposed the proposi
tion. He stated that not for twenty years
past at any inaugural ball had the mem
bers of the Governor's staff received free
tickets. If the committee gave them this
time it would be breaking down an es
tablished precedent. He contended that
If the members of the Governor's staff
were Invited, the members of the staffs
of the various major generals and briga
dier generals of the National _uard
should also be extended a similar cour-
tesy.
Without further debate the committee
declined to accept the suggestion that the
Governor's staff be invited and given com
plmentary tickets.
The meeting of the executive*committee
of the ball committee to-night was a
stormy one. The whole trouble arose
over the matter of free tickets. As is
usual on occasions of the kind, there are
a number of people who seem to think
that the courtesy of a free ticket should
be extended to them, and they sent their
requests in to the invitation and reception
committee. Every elected State official
Is to receive a frj.-e ticket, and the recep
tion committee had arranged to give a
number of tickets to employes and depu
ties in the State House.
To this latter proposition vigorous ob
jection was made by members of the ex
ecutive committee. They argued that the
deputies in the offices in the State House
were amply able to pay for their tickets,
and there existed no reason why compli
mentaries should be given to them.
Finally the executive committee took
up the report of the reception committee
on complimentary tickets and considered
each recommendation as to an allowance
of free tickets separately.
The Governor's office was allowed four
free tickets. The Secretary of State's
office was given five tickets and two
passes. The Treasurer's office was given
one ticket and three passes. The
State Librarian was given one
ticket and four passes. Passes and
tickets for the Attorney General, State
Controller, State Printer and Superin
tendent of Public Instruction were strick
en out altogether. Then allowances were
made as follows: Speaker of Assembly,
two tickets; Surveyor General; one ticket;
Adjutant General, one ticket; Senator
Simpson, two tickets; Chief Clerk of As
sembly, Secretary of Senate, sergeant at
arms of each house and their clerks, each
one ticket. The usual allowance of em
ployes' tickets was made.
The question came up of presenting a
complimentary ticket to Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin. The committee voted not to
allow It. Secretary Lindley of the recep
tion committee stated that, acting under
instructions of the reception committee,
he had already given the major his ticket.
This placed the committee In a rather
embarrassing position. The major al
ready had his ticket and it had been vot
ed not to give him one.
A motion was made that an invitation

TALE OF A SENSATIONAL
ROBBING EPISODE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 7.â The house at 611 X
street, which is supposed to be the place
where any money that may be used in
promoting the Senatorial candidacy of U.
S. Grant is paid out to needy legislator*,
figures in a sensational story that Is be
ing generally circulated here to-day. It
Is asserted that late last night two men,
heavily masked, forced an entrance to
the secret ' apartments supposed to be
occupied by the dispenser ot bribe money,
and forced the occupant to surrender an
amount of money fixed by rumor at $1100,
as well as certain papers that are sup
posed to have a direct and criminal bear
ing on matters that vitally affect certain
legislators and the men with whom they
have had illicit dealings.
Inquiry made at Grant's headquarters
In the Golden Eagle Hotel developed the
fact that Mr. Grant and his agents were
aware of the existence of the tale of rob
bery, but they denied any positive knowl
edge of the facts. They also disclaimed
any knowledge of any illicit use to which
the house at No. 611 was being put.
The landlady of the house in question
also denied that she was aware that any
robbery had been perpetrated in her
house, though she was aware that a story
was being told to that effect. The Chief
of Police had not been Informed of any
robbery, nor has he been requested to
assist in the recovery of any lost or sto
len papers. If any robbery was com
mitted the robbers may be depended upon
not to tell, and it is equally certain that
If the facts are as they are pictured, the , ;
person or persons who were robbed will !
keep their own counsel for reasons that '
are obvious.

an early hour this morning by robbers.
When the local freight reached Bingen
at 3 o'clock the conductor looked in at
the window of the telegraph office, i
Leaning against the wall, sitting up- j
right in his accustomed place, with his
feet on the desk, was the body of Wur- !
ster. His head had been crushed and
there were apparently two bullet holes
in the side of his head. The body was
yet warm, indicating that he had been
murdered but a short time after having
reported his last train at 12:45 a. m.
The office floor was covered with blood,
indicating that there had been a terri
ble struggle. All the drawers had been
rifled and the lifeless form had been
placed in the chair after the murder.
There was no clew to the murderers.
Wurster was 27 years of age and
married.

Registrar W. J. Blggy seems to be hav

election they- carried things with a high
hand in his office and he had no recourse.
The men employed contrary to his de

their warrants; hence the Treasurer re

AN EARLY MORNING EIGHT.
The Meeting and the Mixing Up of a
Politician and a Bookmaker
With Knockout Results.
Politician met with bookmaker in a tug
of real red war at the corner of Ellis and
Powell streets early yesterday morning.
It was a novelty In the way of modern
pugilism, as the affair went on from start
to finish without police interference, and
the bookmaker was doubly not in it. Con
sequently there will be no complaint of
"fake fight," and there will be no coin
to divide up by the principals on the
quiet.
The parties of the early morning meet
ing were James Neil and Phil Archibald,
both well known around the racing cir
cuit. It was short and sharp, a few
warm words were spoken, several blows
were exchanged and Archibald was
beaten down to the sidewalk.
It was the result of an old quarrel be
tween the two men which began about
four years ago, when Archibald was book
ing on the local tracks and Neil was clerk
ing in the Assembly. Archibald had been
ruled off the track, accused of having
been connected with some crooked work,
and Neil being close to the political
throne eventually succeeded in procuring
the disgraced bookkeeper's reinstatement,
In return for some service he performed
for the racing association at Sacramento
they let Archibald return to the track.
Neil claims that the bookmaker promised
to help him In return against the day
when he would find politics no more lucra
tive, and that those promises were as
crust when the politician was down
and the bookmaker was up. Neil, luck
deserted, for about a year has been Im
portuning his one-time friend to lend him
a band, but Archibald lias disavowed any
such obligation. Yesterday morning the
two men came face to face at Powell and
Ellis, and after a short discussion of the
old dispute that part of the tenderloin
was stained with gore. The nearest wit
ness of the battle was the proprietor of
a curbstone cook wagon, who acted as
referee. For a few moments the two
men mixed matters in a dreadful disre
gard for "time" or "breakaway." They
surged up and down the sidewalk and
falling against the referee's cooking ve
hicle almost wrecked it. The bookmaker
went down under the rapid blows of his
antagonist and the single-round fight
ended with his being completely knocked
out. No arrests were made and the two
men were taken Into the back room of the
nearest saloon, where the blood of battle
was washed from their faces and the
fighters, after shaking hands, hurried
homeward in a couple of hacks.

\_y pneumonia, after a few days' illness. He was on duty in the Chief's
office Monday night and complained of a cold. Tuesday morning he
was so bad that
Dr. E. F. Don
nelly was sum
moned, and he
was ordered to
keep to his bed.
Nothing serious
was anticipated
until Friday
night, when he
became delirious.
He became con
scious a few
hours before he
died, but his
death was a great
hock to his fam
ily and friends.
He leaves a wife

when he was
transferred t o
the property
clerk's office to

PREPARING FOR
NEXT CENTURY'S
RIG EXPOSITION
Determination That It
Shall Succeed.
AN ENCOURAGING MEETING
ACTIVE INTEREST TAKEN BY
THE PROMOTERS.
City and State Affairs Will Each Be
Represented by Three Members
of the General Com
mittee.
A meeting of the Pacific Coast Exposi
tion Committee was held yesterday.
Those present had an encouraging word
for the undertaking and all advanced sug
gestions or took part in the discussion of
plans which will be formulated as soon
as the general committee can bo ap
pointed and affairs placed on an operat
ing basis. This will be accomplished be
fore next Saturday, on which day the
committee will again assemble and re
ceive reports, the substance of which will
display the Interest manifested by the
citizens of this city.
A committee consisting of W. H. Mills,
A. A. Watkins and Charles Bundschu
were named by the chair at the last meet
ing for the purpose of selecting a repre
sentative body of business men and citi
zens to act as a general committee. A.
A. Watkins. In the absence of Mr. Mills,
presented the report yesterday afternoon.
It contained suggestions as to the powers
of the managing body and the appoint
ment of an executive committee. It fur*
ther requested that instead of assuming
the responsibility of naming those per
sons who are to represent the various in
terests of city and State, it be permitted
to call upon the various associations to
select persons whom they desire to han
die their affairs at the exposition.
This suggestion met with general ap
proval, and it became the sense of the
meeting that the matter of selection
should remain directly at the discretion
of each branch of business to be repre
sented at the big fair. The city govern
ment, the Merchants' Association, labor
and trades unions, builders and producers,
manufacturing Interests, etc., will all
have a place on the programme and will
be permitted to select their representa
tion on the committee.
Irving M. Scott suggested that the num
ber of represenatives from each of the
interests named be limited to three. This
will secure for all parties equal repre
sentation and will avoid any little germs
of dissatisfaction which might otherwise
arise. Upon this suggestion a motion
was made to the effect that all business
bodies be notified and requested to each
name three members of the general com
mittee, and that this be done before Sat
urday, as the time in which to approach
the Legislature for funds is short. The
motion was carried and the meeting ad
journed until next Saturday afternoon at
3 o'clock.
-S. li. Friedlander mentioned the fact
that the Colonial Fair promoters were
contemplating asking Congress for an ap
propriation with which to conduct their
enterprise. As such an appropriation
Would conflict with the one to be so
licited by the Pacific Coast Exposition, an
invitation will be tendered Mr. Denlcke,
one of the managers, to be present at
the meeting of the latter's committee
next Saturday. Friedlander will have In
charge the department of amusements
and says he will Startle the theatrical
world by the magnitude of his plans.

that was first reported. Their loss of
$35,000 or $40,000 was confined principally
to their stored machinery, patterns and

damaged by water only. The next morn
ing alter the fire they had a large corps
of skilled draughtsmen and pattern mak
ers busy making duplicates of the draw
ings and patterns of irrigation and min
ing machinery destroyed. They are now
running full blast again and are filling
orders as promptly as ever. â¦

FREAK OF A DRUNKEN MAN.
John O'Brien Plays Havoc in a McAl
lister-Street Saloon, Where He
Used to Be Employed.
John O'Brien entered the saloon of
George W. Davis, 9 McAllister street,
about 9 o'clock yesterday morning in a
drunken condition and wanted to fight the
bartender, Fitzgerald, because he had
taken O'Brien's place. Fitzgerald got
him out and locked up the saloon while he
went to Davis' house to tell him about ,
O'Brien's conduct.
After he had gone O'Brien smashed in
the glass panels of the door and entering
the saloon broke a valuable screen in
pieces, overturned the stove and broke
open the cash register, stealing $3 50
that was in the drawer. Word was sent
to the Central police station and Police
man Meyler was detailed to arrest
O'Brien. O'Brien had jumped on a McAl
lister street car going west, and as soon
as he saw Meyler he left the car and
ran into 130 McAllister street and up
stairs, followed by Meyler. There was a
transom at the top and OTJrien broke tne
glass and was attempting to force his
way through, to the astonishment of a
woman who was in the room below, when
Meyler grabbed him and took him to the
City Prison, where he was booked for ma
licious mischief and burglary.
SCHOOLS ARE READY
FOR THE CHILDREN
WILL REOPEN TO-MORROW AF
TER EXTENDED VACATION.
Consolidation of Classes to Be Partly-
Based on the Reports of Attend
ance During the Week.
The public schools will open to-morrow j
morning after the Christmas holidays,
which were extended an extra week ow
ing to|the mlxed-up condition in which
the new Board of Education found the
department when it assumed control.
Coal and other supplies which were urg
ently needed have been secured and dis
tributed where required, hence the pupils
will not suffer for such necessities.
The proposed consolidation of classes
will In a measure be based upon the re
ports rendered by the principals of the
schools at the end of the forthcoming
week. The Directors affirm they will not
determine until they have those reports
as to how many classes will be consoli
dated or what changes will be made in
the department. The retiring board left
matters so badly mixed that it will take
time to unravel all the work of its mem
bers and place the department on proper
footing. It is not expected that many
changes will be announced at the next
meeting, as the Directors have not as yet
formulated their plans.
The funds of the department are se
curely tied up by the two Injunctions se
cured against it, one by the teachers and
another by the merchants who are its
creditors. Until these have been dis
solved no money can be paid from the
school funds, either for salaries or for
supplies.
It is expected a compromise will be ef
fected by the parties in interest shortly
which will tend to clear the situation ancl
give the teachers an idea as to when they
will again commence to draw pay for the
work they are doing in the schools. Some
believe their November and December
salaries are hopelessly lost to them, al
though the organized teachers are still
fighting for them.

MRS. BOTKIN
REMAINED IN
HER HARD BED
She Failed to Appear
for Sentence.
CASE POSTPONED A WEEK
THE DEFENSE REQUESTED A
FURTHER DELAY.
District Attorney Murphy Objected
and Carried His Point John
Hosmer Will Assist in
the Future.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, the condemned
murderess, did not stand before Judge
Cook for sentence yesterday morning; in
fact, she did not appear in court at all,
but remained in her hard cat out in the
Branch County Jail. When called yes
terday morning by Under Sheriff Dave
Martin she drew herself up on her pil
low and answered that she was too ill to
go to court. Her statement was accept
ed and she was left in charge of her Sis
ter, Mrs. RobartS, who is her constant
attendant.
When the case of "Cordelia Botkin for
sentence" was called Attorney Frank lvtc-
Gowan arose and asked the court to grant
a stay of three weeks.
"We have just concluded the hearing
of this case," he said, "and feel that we
are entitled to time in which to consider
our future plans."
District Attorney Murphy objected to so
long a stay, but consented that a week
be granted the defense. He then looked
around and noting the absence of Mrs.
Botkin inquired why she was not present.
McGowan stated that his client was ill,
and Under Sheriff Martin corroborated
him.
"Very well, then," said District Attor
ney Murphy, '"! consent that the case go
over a week, and suggest that the rea
son, the illness of the defendant, be
spread upon the minutes of the court."
Judge Cook granted the motion, and the
District Attorney then informed the court
that Attorney Hosmer, who had so ably
prosecuted the case against the convicted
murderess, had agreed to lend his as
sistance when the case came up in the
future. "I wish to thank the gentleman
for his courtesy." said Judge Murpny, and
the court scene was closed.

The Walker Accident.
Captain John Bermingham, Supervising
Inspector of Local and Foreign Steam
Vessels, has practically and for the space
of sixty days overruled the decision of
Captains Bulger and Bolles in the mat
ter of the explosion on board the river
steamer T. C. Walker. The Local In
spectors decided that the explosion was
due to the fact that the water was al
lowed to get low in the boilers, and Issued
an order that the Navigation Company
should employ two licensed engineer
instead of one, in order to prevent such
accidents in the future. In the meanwhile
he hopes that the accident will not be re
peated, and when he returns from Wash
ington at the end of sixty days he will
examine into the merits of the case.

"WINDY AND DISAGREEABLE."
When a man blows wind off his stomach, that is flatulence*
Sometimes people call it gulping wind. No matter what you call it,'
the disease, for it is a disease, is an annoying one to you and disgust-
ing to your friends. I once heard a politician speak of a rival, whom
he did not admire, as a flatulent ojd fool. Flatulent means windjeJ
Usually we mean by it wind collected in the stomach. Wind in tho
intestines may also be just as properly designated flatulence. It is
always caused by indigestion. A physician, who practices in a town
near Albany, New York, reports the case of an old gentleman who
had been so annoyed by a persistent condition of flatulence that he
had consulted all the doctors in the vicinity without securing any
benefit. Finally he came to me and I prescribed several remedies
which failed utterly. I then prescribed Ripans Tabules, which he re-
ported gave him immediate relief, and he is now nearly cured. I think
it would be an excellent thing to make a strong feature of - flatulence *j
in all the R-I*P-A*N-S advertisements, for I find them 2_ce_tf_t i_K

WILBUR SUES FOR DIVORCE.
Decides That Married Life Is a Fail-
ureâ Other Unhappy Couples.
Henry X. Wilbur, the United States mail
agent, whose unhappy marital relations
were related in The Call yesterday, filed
suit yesterday against his wife, Laura
Wilbur, for a divorce. In his complaint
Wilbur sets forth that his wife, during
his enforced absence on the run between
here and Los Angeles, has been in the
habit of consorting with other men and
has been drinking to excess. In addition
Mrs. Wilbur is charged with being the
possessor of an ungovernable temper,
which ofttimes led her to abuse her hus
band, call him vile names and generally
make his lit.- miserable. For these rea
sons he asks that the court set him free.
John Melville has sued his wife, Agnes
MÂ« lvilee, for a divorce, alleging desertion
as a cause of complaint. ..-"-, ~"j;

Margaret H. Bennett has filed her an
swer and cross-complaint in the suit of
her husband, Frank H. Bennett, for di
vorce. Mrs. Bennett denies that she has
been guilty of infidelity, as her husband
charges, and avers that her husband has
long treated her in an inhuman manner.
and for this reason she asks that a decree
of divorce be granted to her on the
ground of cruelty.

DUCK SHOOTING
ON A
VERY WET DAY
Duck hunters in all parts of the State
where the birds frequent are now en
joying tolerably good sport. The rain has
caused the broadbills to scatter, and as
a consequence the sportsmen of the south
will now be afforded an opportunity of
having a fling at their favorite pastime.
Recent reports from Delano and Bakers
field are very gratifying. A party of four
returned from the duck shooting grounds
near Delano Saturday a week ago with a
mixed bag of birds, amounting to four
hundred and fifty-three.
Although the late storm has Interfered
with shooting near at hand, local hunt
ers, nevertheless, anticipate good sport
to-day, as they contend that the
"quackers" will certainly return to their
old haunts unless another heavy rain
storm is near at hand.
Last Sunday's downpour caught quite a
number of enthusiastic trigger pullers
away from shelter, and it is safe to say
that among the wet ones there have been
some "thoroughbreds," who will not go
Into the mud fields again unless they are
comfortably "stoweu" away in heavy
rubber garments.
Lloyd Eaton and his friend. Van Slycke,
concluded that a little Sunday shoot on
Crystal Spring Lake would return them
quite a respectable bag of large ducks.
They, however, did not calculate on be
ing caught in a storm and having to face
a rough coating of lake water. But they
proved themselves game sports, and like
good "Indians" faced the threatening ele
ments.
On the lake in question is a small isl
and, to which place they rowed in the
early morn in a small boat, anticipating,
of course, a redhot fusillade at passing
birds.
The nimrods were enjoying tolerably
good shooting at animate objects that did
not stop to inquire about the strange re
ports below, when Van Slycke suddenly
detected a band of "Markiand" pelicans
in a cove near the western shore of the
lake.
"Those are my size," remarked "Van"
to his somewhat disgusted companion,
"and I snail row over and double up a
few of Mem birds.* "
Van was true to his word and pulled
to Pelican Cove, where he landed with
some difficulty, as the wind whistled
down the gulches surrounding the lake,
causing the whitecaps to spring up on all
sides. After traveling several yards on
all fours he managed to secure two easy
distance shots at the- big white flappers,
and to his surprise and abject disgust the
long-necked birds said something strange
in pelican dialect, and then Van, with
eyes aghast, saw the feathers slowly but
surely packing away the meat.
As the wide-range marksman expressed
it: "I never was so disgusted before. I
certainly calculated on having pelican
stew tor breakfast next morning."
While the crawl for royal gam.- was in
progress the lake became an angry sea,
and when Van Slycke decided to return
tor "the Indian," who was landlocked on
Crystal Island, he concluded that to ven
ture again on the lake would mean the
swamping of the boat and a decrease of
1 per cent of the German population of
this State.
'Well, it's too bad," muttered Van to
himself, "to leave the poor Indian sole
occupant of the island where nobody lives;
but, then, self-preservation is the life of
man, and I shall await the coming of the
calm and a tranquil sea,"
Van did wait ten long and weary hours
before he dared venture on the lake again,
and. according to hearsay, it was drawing
close to the midnight hour when the brace
of despondent duck-shooters left the
"happy hunting grounds," soaked with
the- dew of heaven and vowing "never to
go there any more." Birds killed: One
island muskalonge and three fairy divers.
Four very new members of the Olympic
Gun Club, unmindful of the fact that
there are times when a pocket stove be
comes a very necessary adjunct to the
paraphernalia of a duck-hunter who is
not conversant with the ins and outs of
the game, ventured on the mud flats of
the club's preserve last Sunday morning
and returned about noon to the bleak old
shack on the marsh, tired, hungry and
disgusted with the "respectable" load of
water each man carried.
Report says the gentlemen fired several
"modest" shots at passing feathers, but
that their fingers were so exceedingly
sleepy that the bulk of the shot passed
to the leeward of the birds aimed at, and
as a consequence the boys did not feast
on mallard duck stew that afternoon.
In the shack they found a coal oil lamp,
around which the disheartened hunters
gathered and warmed up as best they
could until the arrival of the night train,
it was a cold day for the tyros, but
doubtless they will not soon forget their
first experience on the O. G. C. preserve.
Jim Chesley and his Imported cocker
spaniels have grown considerably since
Sunday. Jim laughs at the weather, as
all days look alike to him when he carries
a gun or a fishing rod. Chesley does not
deny that he was shot at by Jupiter Plu
vlus and that he was hit by many pellets,
but he laughed at his luck, and says that
as long as his pets are OK he can stand
a little soaking occasionally.
Charley Precht is authority for the
statement that the distance between Point
Reyes station and Marshalls is fifty miles.
Charley did not find the man and the cart
awaiting his arrival at Marshalls last
Saturday night, and rather than sleep un
der a Tomales Bay Rock he returned to
Point Reyes on foot, arriving just in
season to celebrate the advent of the
new year. On Sunday last 325 ducks were
killed on the Point Reyes marsh.
A BLUE OUTLOOK FOR
THE FIELD TRIALS
The Pacific Coast special committee of
the American Kennel Club convened on
Thursday evening last at the Occidental
Hotel. The meeting .was a special
one, adjourned from the previous Thurs
day, and was held to consider a communi
cation from the secretary of the Ameri
can Club, referring to the committee for
action and report the question of three
clubs affiliated with the American Ken
nel Club, which have connected them
selves with the newly organized Pacific
Kennel League. These clubs are the
Santa Clara Valley Kennel and Poultry-
Association, the California State Kennel
and Poultry Association and the Collie
Club of California, and the question asked
of the committee by the American Kennel
Club was whether the action of these
three clubs in joining the Pacific Kennel
League did or did not warrant their ex
pulsion from the American Kennel Club.
This is the first business that has come
up before the committee, and, being
fraught with the gravest consequences to
the kennel interests of the coast, it de
served and obtained the most serious
consideration and discussion by the com
mittee. :*â â¢.:- ; â¢ âr \v"
After two lengthy meetings the de
cision was reached unanimously that the
formation of the Pacific Kennel League
was too trivial a matter for the notice of
the American Kennel Club;* that the Pa
cific Kennel League represented but an
insignificant proportion of the fanciers of
the coast and that this proportion was
composed either of misguided individuals
who had been led astray or of self-seek
ing and interested malcontents who had
only their own interests at heart.
A resolution was passed that a commu
nication be forwarded to the American
Kennel Club, stating that it is the sense
of the committee that the dignity and
Importance of the parent organization de
mand that the Pacific- Kennel League be
ignored entirely; that the league repre
sents no important interests on this
coast; that if ignored it must eventually
die of inanition, and that such a course
would redound to the harmony and best
interests of kenneklom on the Pacific
Slope and to the Interests of the Ameri
can Kennel Club and would further have
the effect of enhancing the efficiency of
the Pacific Coast special committee in
transacting the American Kennel Club
business here.
The field trials seem predestined to
failure this year. Colonel Arthur Merrl
man of Kentucky, who was to have act
ed as judge, has canceled his contract on
account of death in his family, and C. N.
Post of Sacramento, William Dormer of
San Francisco and George Richards of the
Verona kennels have been selected to act
in his stead.

GOLF DOINGS
HERE
AND ELSEWHERE
The men's championship, match .play, of
the San Francisco Golf Club is yet unde
cided. J. W. Byrne and H. Babcock are
In the final heat, and had proposed to
play It off Friday morning, but owing to
the indisposition of the latter this was
not done. The contest will, doubtless, be
a close one. In the Liverpool gold medal
competition last Monday H. Babcock and
J. W. Byrne made the first nine holes in
52 each; in the second round H. Bab
cock's score was 51 and J. W. Byrne's 54.
In the silver medal competition J. W.
Byrne did not finish, while H. Babcock
made the first round in 53 and the second
in 51. ...
Orestes Pierce, captain of the Oakland
Golf Club, has returned from a visit to
the Eastern States, where he took les
sons from the celebrated player and man
ufacturer of golf clubs, W. Dunn. He has
brought back with him some suggestions
for improvements in the Oakland links.
The distance from the first teeing ground
to "cornerstone," the first hole, which is
now 200 yards, is to be lengthened to 500
yards, and the distance between "fence"
and "gully," the second and third holes,
which is now 160 yards, will also be ma
terially lengthened. New iron flags will
also be placed in each hole. The putting
greens will be well rolled while they are
soft from the recent rain, and will be
much Improved thereby. Melville, the
professional, has left the Oakland Golf
Club, and John G. Motion has been en
gaged in his place.
At the golf tournamentvheld on the links
of the Los Angeles Country Club at Pico
Heights the competitions scheduled to
take place between men and women mem
bers on December 31 were begun, but not
concluded. About twenty-five entered the
competition for men, 36 holes, medal play,
the maker of the best gross score to re
ceive the club championship and a gold
medal, and the maker of the best net
score (after deducting handicap) to re
ceive a silver medal. The contest was
not finished, but the best card handed in
at the close of the day's play was that of
W. Cosby, who, playing at scratch, made
a score of 173, or a slight fraction over 43
strokes per round. The competition for
women members of the club, at 18 holes,
medal play, the maker of the best gross
score to win the club championship and
a gold medal, was won by Mrs. Hugh
Vail, at scratch, with a gross score of
121. The second prize, a silver medal, for
the lady making the best net score; was
won by Mrs. J. D. Foster, whose- gross
score was 126 and net score, after deduct
ing her handicap of six, was 120. The
driving competition for women was won
by Miss Gertrude McCrea, with a drive
of 130 yards, other competitors being
Mesdames J. F. Sartori, E. Silent. C.
Monroe, A. C. Balch, J. C. Koepfle and
P. Severance.
On Monday. January 2, the open ama
teur competitions, for men at 36 holes,
medal play, and for women, at IS holes,
medal play (the maker of the best gross
score in each competition to receive a
gold medal and the maker of the second
best gross score In each competition to
receive a silver medal), were postponed
until to-day on account of the rain. An
elaborate luncheon was served in the club
house to about fifty people, among whom
were many of the best known members of
the Country Club, as well as Messrs. Rob
ertson, Owen, Morgan and Bates of the
Highland Golf Club.
It is expected that the open competi
tions, which may be entered by any ama
teur golfer, will bring out some fine play.
Not only will the best golfers of the Los
Angeles Club enter the contests but also
Messrs. Orr and Cravens of Pasadena,
W. H. Young of Duarte, Wood of Colo
rado and Butcher of Riverside.
The golf tournament which was to have
been held on the links of the PachapDa
Club at Riverside on January 2 was post
poned on account of the rain.
SINGLE BASEBALL
LEAGUE
NEXT SEASON
The Recreation Park Association has
settled all differences with the baseball
managers and everything is now in a fair
way for the organization of the six-city
baseball league.
The rupture between the association and
Managers Kipp of Sacramento, La Rosa
of San Jose and Cal Ewing of Oakland
is now a thing of the past, giving way
to the most amicable relations of a happy
family of six. The new league will com
prise teams from Watsonville, Santa
Cruz. San Jose, Oakland, Sacramento and
San Francisco. The managers will meet
informally to-morrow afternoon and
discuss the preliminary plans of organiza
tion. Monday evening a general and for
mal meeting will be held, at which an
organization will be effected.
with this settlement of managerial dif
ficulties the probability of rival leagues
is set at naught. The intention of the as
sociation is to begin the season in March,
playing games Saturday and Sunday af
ternoons at the beginning, and at the close
of the racing season to play a midweek
game. The managers are showing great
activity even at this early date in the
signing of players.
There will be no prolonged winter sea
son, for at the close of Seattle's visit the
grounds will be renovated, the stands re
built and everything put in readiness for
an early opening in the spring. Oakland
will have grounds of its own and the peo
ple of that city will be given the chance
to sec the national game without a trip
to this side. -
Yesterday afternoon Seattle was to
have lined up against the Athletics,
but the rain interfered. The record of
the Northerners shows a winning of two
games out of four since their arrival in
San Francisco. They have steadily im
proved in their play since the first game
with Oakland and are now in good con
dition.
CATCHING STEELHEADS
IN COAST STREAMS
Steelheads are now running into the
Russian River and Point Reyes Creek
and with weather permitting anglers
should soon be enjoying some grand sport
with the king of fresh water fishes.
The outlook for to-day is not very prom
ising, as the rain will certainly raise the
streams should it fall in large quantities.
Last Sunday a steelhead weighing ten
and a half pounds was caught at the
White House pool. Point Reyes, just after
the train had pulled out for this city. A
few fish were taken during the week
past, but the long-expected big run has
not yet put in an appearance.
To-Day's Handball Games.
The schedule for to-day's game at Phil
Ryan's handball court, 858 Howard street,
promises to be above the average. Four
teen of , the picked San Francisco players
are programmed for the afternoon's sport.
They are as follows:
E. Barry and M. Kiroy vs. J. Kirby and
D. Regan.
J. Condon and P. Foley vs. T. Leach and
R. Housman.
T. Ryan and T. Hutchinson vs. J. Law*

The Morgue Wagon Broke Down.
While Driver Thomas Smith and Dep
uty Coroner Sullivan were riding on the
Morgue wagon on their way to the Harbor
Hospital at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon
on Sacramento street, near Montgomery,
the front axle broke, letting down the
wagon gear and throwing Sullivan and
Smith to the ground. Smith fell between
the horses and almost under their feet,
and by the barest good luck escaped with
out injury other than a few bruises and
scratches Sullivan was equally fortunate
in escaping. :
ELECT OFFICERS
FOR THE
COMING SEASON
Though the stormy weather somewhat
diminished the number of Corinthians
who were present at the annual New
Year's day dinner at the Tiburon club
house, there was quite a large party. The
whole affair was, as on former occasions,
under the general superintendence of
Port Captain John A. Keefe, and was ex
cellently managed. The large room was
decorated with flags won in various re
gattas by Corinthian yachts, and a hand
some array of silver cups decorated the
mantelpiece, including the. Macdonough
cups for 1895, 1896 and 1897, the Perpetual
Challenge cup, the Wallace, Law and Del
egates' cups:
The California Yacht Club at its an
nual meeting elected officers for 1899. Al
len M. Clay, secretary of the Bank of
California, and owner of the sloop Pac
tolus, was chosen commodore; A. C. Lee
of the sloop Surprise is vice commodore;
E. N. Walter of the First National Bank
of Oakland will continue to fulfill the du
ties of treasurer; R. L. Fames of the
sloop Surf was elected secretary; C. E.
Clark, port captain; and J. J. Sherry of
the yawl Gypsie, measurer. In addition
to the commodore, vice commodore, sec
retary and treasurer, who are ex-officio
members, the board of directors includes
L. S. Sherman of the sloop Royal, Carl A.
Tanberg of the yawl Verona, J. A. Burn
ham, A. R. Wilson of the yawl Pilgrim
and C. L. Lancaster, formerly of the
sloop Edna. The regatta committee con
sists of B. W. Robson of the sloop Vol an
te, George turn Suden of the sloop Re
gina and R. R. l'Hommedleu. The dele
gates to the Pacific Interclub Yacht As
sociation are C. J. Lancaster, R. R.
l'Hommedieu and E. N. Walter. In the
hope of increasing the membership of the
club no initiation fee will be charged dur
ing the first six months of 1899. It is ex
pected that more than a dozen new mem
bers will be added to the club roll at
the next meeting.
The Enclnal Yacht Club suffered a seri
ous loss by fire on the morning of Janu
ary 2. The whole of the annex, including
the billiard room and tables, the bowl
ing alley, card tables and shuffleboard,
was destroyed; also about forty of the
bath houses. The main boat house, which
was about fifty feet distant from the
annex, was unharmed. It is believed that
the fire must have started from burning
coals left in the grate, and that it must
have smoldered all night until it was
discovered, at about 8 o'clock a. m. on
Tuesday. The fire was difficult to reach
on account of the distance of the club
buildings from the shore, but after about
two thousand feet of hose had been ob
tained good work was done in subduing
the flames. The plank walk leading to
the club house and the bath houses were
fully covered by Insurance. On the an
nex and contents, valued at about $4000,
there is $3200 insurance. A meeting of the
directors and stockholders was held Fri
day night to discuss the course to be pur
sued by the club.
A good deal of work has been done on
the Iselln-Morgnn cup defender at Bris
tol, Rhode Island. The wooden mold for
the lead keel is nearly ready. It is six
feet deep in the clear, and so is somewhat
deeper than the mold made for the keel
of the Defender in 1895, which was five
feet eight inches in the clear. The lead
keel of the new cup defender will not
be as long as that of the Defender, though
it will extend further forward; the lead
will be more concentrated.
OARSMEN MAY FORM
A NEW ASSOCIATION
The convention of the National Asso
ciation of Amateur Oarsmen will take
place on January 21, when all delegates
are expected to attend. At the present
time al) the local rowing clubs are mem
bers of the Pacific Association of the Am
ateur Athletic Union, and send delegates
to that body, which will hold its regular
monthly meeting next Friday, Jan
uary 13. But at least two of the bay row
ing clubsâ the Alamedas and the South
Endsâ are lukewarm in their allegiance to
the association. The delegate from the
South End Rowing Club to the regatta
committee of the association, M. Breen,
having failed to attend two meetings in
succession, a notice was sent to his club
requesting that either he attend regularly
or that another representative be sent.
At their recent semi-annual election of
officers the South Ends chose J. P. Foley,
J. E. Scully and R. Me Arthur as delegates
to the association, and of these thiee it
is understood that R. McArthur will be
put on the regatta committee. It has,
however, been suggested that the regatta
committee may refuse to make any
change in its personnel during its year
of office. If any difficulty should arise
about accepting their representative, it is
not unlikely that the South Ends would
withdraw from the local branch of the
Amateur Athletic Union and join the
National Association of Amateur Oars
men.
The Alameda Boat Club has been a
member for two years past of the Na
tional Association, but is in favor of or
ganizing a local association. Its members
see no reason why the rowing men should
be connected with the Amateur Athletic
Union, when in the other States they have
independent organizations. The rowing
clubs of Oregon, Washington and Brit
ish Columbia are members of the North
western Association of Amateur Oarsmen,
and hold annual regattas under the rules
of that association. The yachtsmen of
the bay of San Francisco have an or
ganization called the Pacific Interclub
yacht Association, of which all the yacht
clubs are members, sending three dele
gates apiece. An annual interclub re
gatta is held by the association, and also
an annual cruise. There are many oars
men who see no good reason why the
rowing clubs should not unite to form
a Pacific Interclub Rowing Association,
which should have for its objects the en
couragement of -building and boat
racing and the establishing and enforcing
of uniform rules for the govern
ment of all races in which two
or more clubs, members of the asso
ciation, shall compete, any recognized
boating club located on the Pacific Coast
to be eligible as a member of the associa
tion. .
RECKLESS RAILROAD MEN.
An Out-Bound San Jose Train Runs
Down and Kills a Horse.
The 5:30 afternoon train bound for San
Jose yesterday ran over a horso and
wagon belonging to B. Materazzo, a veg
etable dealer, whose place of business is
on the northeast corner of Twentieth
and Guerrero streets. Materazzo was go
ing out Valencia street with a load of
goods for delivery to his customers, and
when crossing that street and Twenty
fourth he had just reached the railroad
track when he was horrified to see the
up train approaching him. His presence
of mind saved his life. It was too late
to attempt to back or go ahead, so he
turned a somersault backward over the
seat of the wagon and landed in a heap
on the street. About the same time the
horse was hit by the engine and swerved
round. This brought the wagon on to
the track, and it took less time for that
instrument of destruction to make kind
ling wood of the vehicle than it would to
tell the story.
The fast running train passed on to the
Valencia street station, where it stopped.
The horse was cut on the side, and had
its near hind leg broken.
In the meantime the conductor came
back to ascertain the extent of the dam
age, and then mounted his train and went
on as though the killing of a vegetable
dealer's horse was an everyday occur
rence.
After an examination Police Officer
Crackbon shot the Injured horse.
There are several witnesses ready to
testify that no whistle was blown by the
engine or bells rung as the train ap
proached the crossing.
The loss of the horse and wagon is a
serious one to Materazzo as he had but
recently purchased the rig, paying what
spare coin he had for the turnout, the
better to enable him to make a living for
himself and his little family.
The Duty of the Laity.
Dr. Jessie Farmer, will deliver a free
lecture at the rooms of the Woman's
Educational Union, Van Ness avenue,
on Tuesday evening. The subject will be
"The Duty of the Laity to Physicians."
GREAT HARES
RAN BEFORE
FLEET DOGS
Five Mile Courses at
Ingleside Park.
; â â *".
BEST SPORT OF THE SEASON
HOUNDS THAT HAD GRUELERS
ON THE RUN DOWN.
Flyers That Should Give* Good Ac
counts of Themselves in the
Final Courses' of the
â  Meeting.
The large gathering of sport lovers who
witnessed the coursing at Ingleside Park
yesterday, notwithstanding the inclem
ency of the weather, retired from the
grounds satisfied that the day's sport was
particularly good.
Hares! Well, they were tuned up to
the highest key, and since the park was
established there never have been such
long and punishing runs.
Men conversant with the game can rea
lize what the sport must have been when
such dogs as Armagh Lass and Leonora
coursed for 5 minutes 32 seconds, Law
rence and Wolfe Tone for 5 minutes 29 sec
onds, Red Wings and St. Mary for 5 min
utes 0 seconds. Willful and Speculation
for 4 minutes 50 seconds, Soubrette and
Flush for 4 minutes 52 seconds, Lady Gil
more and War Cloud 4 minutes 30 seconds.
Many of the remaining courses were
from two to three minutes' duration, ancl
the shortest course of the day lasted 1
minute 35 seconds, all of which proves
conclusively that when The Call said on
Saturday that great coursing would cer
tainly result on the first day of the big
meeting it did not shoot far from the
mark. y'y-
The patrons of this great outdoor game
are now thoroughly satisfied that Ingle
side Park holds the winning card so far
as coursing is concerned, and judging
from the large and enthusiastic crowds
that assemble at ingleside on days that
are fine, or on days that are wet, it can
be safely said that the old park is here
to stay and to conquer.
Considerable was expected yesterday
from Mr. Curtis' dog Commodore, but
when a report arrived that that grand
dog had injured himself on Friday and
had consequently to be withdrawn much
sympathy was expressed for his owner.
Cavalier did not run up to his past form
and will doubtless meet with defeat to
day unless he can do better. Maud S
ran a very clever course, but it was com
paratively a grueler. . Being, however, of
the Emm Pasha-Rochette stock she
should be well able to repeat to-day.
The dogs that should give good accounts
of themselves and will require watching
are Patrla, Koolawn, Young America,
Rathbone, Golden Russet and Moondyne.
Those who could not attend yesterday's
meeting, but who will be in attendance
to-day, must take into consideration that
Armagh Lass, Lawrence, Forgive. Red
Wings, Willful, Soubrette, Martha Wash
ington, Lady Gilmore, O'Grady and
Prince George had hard and punishing
courses in yesterday's rundown, the re
sults of which are appended:

ASSOCIATED CYCLISTS
COME TO AN AGREEMENT
WILL SANCTION THE COMING
INDOOR TOURNAMENT.
By-Laws Amended So That All Riders
in Association Events Must Be
Members of the Body.
The regular monthly meeting of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs was
held last night at its offices in the Parrott
building, the following officers and direct
ors being present: Paul M. Nippert, presi
dent, Stanley G. Scovern, secretary; Dr.
Thomas L. Hill, Harry Larkin, Judge
Frank H. Kerrigan, Charles Albert Ad
ams, Will C. Corbett, T. G. Spillane. W.
L. Loos, W. W. Thompson, T. D. "Whit
man. Chester S. Danley, Charles A Neal,
M. E. Games, Herbert D. Clark, C. N.
Ravlln, H. W. Spalding, John Humphrey
and W. J. Kenney.
An application was read from the
American Cycle Racing Association for a
sanction for the proposed indoor tourna
ment to be held here in February. It was
decided to grant the request and to aid
the promoters in every way possible.
The much-discussed amendment to the
constitution, providing that all riders in 1
association races must be members of the

r.'l' 'LONDON, Jan. 7. â All events seem to

The past twenty-four hours brought
â â¢the. publication of the Madagascar blue

"â '.editorial in the Times denouncing

CHINESE BURGLARCAPTURED
As a Laundryman He Has Been Successfully
Robbing Fashionable Hotels.
FOR several months Detectives Gibson, Wren and McMahon have been on
the trail of a Chinese burglar, and their efforts to capture him were
spurred on by the increasing complaints received at police headquarters
from people whose rooms or houses had been robbed. Yesterday morn
intr they r_ntnred him in his room at Prospect place and Clay street,
md took him to the City Prison,
where he was locked up in the
'tanks." The detectives recovered
about $100 worth of stolen prop
erty in his room, and altogether
hey have recovered from pawn
shops in Chinatown over $2000
worth of his spoils.
The burglar is Lew Yuen Sing,
alias Lew Wing. He was given
three months on August 11, 1888,
In the House of Correction for
petty larceny, and on- July 20, 1890,
he was sentenced to one year in
San Quentin for burglary. He
obtained access to hotels and
houses by pretending that he
ailed for the laundry, and some
times he would take the laundry
away with him and as much jew
elry as he could gather.
On June 23 he entered the room
of Mrs. J. L. Wilson, In the
Ralston Hotel, 1222 Pine street,
and stole a quantity of jewelry.
August 23 he entered the room
of Mrs. D. Gadge in the
same hotel and stole jewelry.
August 2 he stole from the room
of Mrs. J. Tevis, Beresford Hotel,
COO Bush street, a purse contain
ing money. Miss Gould's room in
the same hotel was entered about
a week ago and jewelry stolen.
Mrs. L. E. Parker's house, 1414
California street, was entered in
August and several diamonds
were stolen. August 4 the rooms
y% s. y~ of Mrs. S. A. Jackson, 1001 Sutter
J[x. _**^ street, were entered and a gold
V**"*"* â  '^' X^*^***"^ \. L ._^^ watch and jewelry stolen, and the
house next door was entered the
same day and a gold watch
stolen. On October 27 the rooms
of Miss May Wilson, 1112 Larkin street, were entered and a gold
watch and chain stolen. Christmas day the room of G. C. Woodworth, Hotel
Victoria, and the rooms of Mrs. Paul Hoffman were entered, and watches
and jewelry stolen. New Year's day Mme. Cortez's rooms in the Hotel
Bella Vista were visited and jewelry and money stolen. There may be
others, but these are all attributed to Lew Yuen Sing.
I and C. A. Baird, members of the Ox
l ford University, are inaugurating a
! scheme for the establishment of a col
! lege for labor leaders which is attract
â¢ ing considerable attention.
It appears that they came especially
i from America to carry out the project.
| The college will be called Ruskin Hall.
They have leased Stebbs House, an old
mansion built in 1649, near Christ Col
lege, and it will be opened on Wash
ington's birthday by a meeting in Ox
ford â¢hall. Ruskin Hall will ac
commodate forty men. There will be
no ordinary servants, but among the
students will be cooks and other ser
vants who will get their board free in
return for four hours' daily work. Th
remainder of their time will be avail
able for study. The entire expense of
the students for board, lodging and tui
tion will be Â£1 a week. Fifty gratuit
ous tuitions will be given during the
first two years, and fifty students have
already been selected for will first year.

DEMAND A LOWER
PRICE FOR WATER
FRUITVALE RESIDENTS OBJECT
TO CINCHING.
Favor a Reasonable Profit for the

More.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 7.
Residents of Fruitvaie believe they are
being cinched in the matter of water
rates. There have been several meetings
recently to consider the question, and
next Monday the following petition will
be presented to the Board of Supervisors:
"To the Honorable Board of Supervis
ors of the County of AlamedaâGentle
men: At a mass-meeting of the taxpay
ers and citizens resident in Fruitvaie, held
at Masonic Hall, Fruitvaie, this sth day
of January, 1899, the following resolutions
were unanimously adopted:
"Whereas, The existing rates at which
water is supplied to rate-payers residing
outside the limits of the corporate
cities of this county by the Contra
Costa and Oakland Water Companies are
excessive and far beyond all equality of
comparison as to what a reasonable rate
would be to enable the companies to real
ize a profitable return on their invest
ments, and also having every reason to
believe that the said companies are row
contemplating to advance the rates be
yond the .present excessive figures; and,
whereas there is such a difference In
the .rates charged on water for pub
lic utilities and that charged for private
consumption, and believing that an
equitable -.adjustment of this difference
an be made; therefore,- be It
"Resolved. That it is the sense of this
meeting that the Board of Supervisors be
and they are hereby petitioned to take
such action as will make an equitable ad
justment of the existing water rates,
thereby very materially reducing the price
charged private consumers. That this
resolution be spread upon the minutes of
this meeting and a copy thereof be pre
sented to the Board of Supervisors.

Mrs. Mentel : Falls in a Faint.
OAKLAND, Jan. 7.â Life behind prison
bars is telling on Mrs. Anna Mentel, ac
cused of the murder of her husband.
â  For the past few days Mrs. Mentel has
been suffering from la grippe, and this
morning, while attempting to walk across
the main room in the women's corridor
she fainted and fell to the floor at the
County Jail. Or. Porter, the prison physi
cian, was immediately summoned, and ap
plied restoratives. Mrs. Mentel Is not
strong physically, and the conditions of
the jail arc anything but conducive to
the health of persons not robust.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY; JANUARY 8, 1899.
DIDN'T KNOW
FEIDLER'S GUN
WAS LOADED
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 7.
There is a hole in the diploma of ex-
Coroner Baldwin, and as the result of
the curiosity of Dr. Baldwin's cousin,
Mr. McDonald of Stanislaus, the cousin
has an Injured eye, a burned face, and
can tell a good story of how close he was
to ing a subject for Dr. Baldwin's suc
cessor.
He and McDonald, a merchant of Stan
islaus County. County Treasurer Feidler,
Deputy Jailer Taylor and Dr. Baldwin
were discussing politics in the doctor's
office this morning, and with his usual
generosity Dr. Baldwin went to a drawer
to get a box of cigars. As soon as the
drawer was opened Feidler saw his two
bright revolvers, which he had brought
with him* from Livermore last Tuesday,
when he came to take charge of the
county treasury. Mr. Feidler found Oak
land so much less woolly than he had
been led to believe while living in seclu
sion in Livermore that he gave his guns
into the custody of the ex-Coroner.
Feidler took the guns out of the drawer,
and while he was busy cleaning one Mc-
Donald's curiosity overcame him and he
handled the other. His curiosity went to
the length of looking down the barrel
while a ringer was on the trigger. Before
his curiosity was satisfied there was an
explosion, the glass over Dr. Baldwin's
diploma was shattered and McDonald fell
groaning to the floor, thinking he had
been killed.
An investigation showed that the curi
ous cousin from Stanislaus had burned
his face, Injured his eye and severely
frightened himself. When he was picked
up he calmly declared that he "didn't
know it was loaded."
NARROW AND
BROAD GAUGE
ARE MIXED
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 7.
One mere accident was added this morn
ing to the many that have already oc
curred at the new Harrison street bridge.
The result of the derailing of a switch
engine was that all the narrow gauge
traffic was suspended three hours after
the usual time of the opening of the ser
vice for the day.
The accident was caused by the same
carelessness that has already derailed
several trainsâ the throwing of the switch
before all the train had passed over it.
A switch engine was backing toward Ala
meda early this morning and when on
the high trestle approach to the bridge
was derailed, . and when the locomotive
was stopped the wheels were within a
few inches of going off Into the water.
The crew remained with the engine, al
though It ran 150 feet over the sleepers
after being derailed, and it was likely at
any moment to go Into the stream. The
tender did not leave the track and this
helped in some measure to prevent the
ditching of the engine.
The throwing of the switch after the
tender bad crossed and before the loco
motive was on the broad track caused the
accident. At this point the switch ope
rates broad and narrow gauge tracks to
accommodate the two systems that run 1
up to Fourteenth street. One of th*
tracks is broad and the other narrow
gauge, and If the switch be not operated
rightly the broad gauge train will be
thrown onto the narrow gauge track,
which Is of course an instant derailing.
There have been many accidents of this
nature at this same spot, although the
bridge has not yet been opened three
months. So far the fatalities attending
the old narrow gauge system have not
been repeated, but unless the switch be
operated with much greater care a re
turn to the old period of catastrophes is
expected.
The accident this morning occurred long
before daylight, and the wrecking train
was busy till half past 8. though tie first
train should go to the mole at 6 o'clock.
Death of Judge Wilcox.
OAKLAND. Jan. 7.-John Wilcox, for
the past six years Justice of the Peace at
San Pablo, died to-day at the age of 66
years. Deceased was a native of New
York, and came west in 1552. For'thirty
years thereafter he conducted a black
ami thing business at San Pablo, and be
came one of the best known men in that
section, as is shown by his election and
re-election as a Justice. He leaves only a
widow.
Farrell Pays His Fine.
OAKLAND, Jan. Deputy Pound*
master Peter Farrell, who last year was
convicted of battering a small boy in his
effort to impound his pet dog, has finally
paid a fine of $50. Although Farrell
pleaded several times that he would be
unable to pay the fine it did not require .
any coaxing on the part of Police Judge
Smith to induce the deputy poundman to
quickly produce the amount when forced
to the. alternative of twenty-five days"
in the City Prison. yy-
CORPORAL HEALY COMING.
The Call's Soldier-Correspondent Re
turning From Manila.
Corporal . Frederick A. Healy of the
First California Volunteers, now stationed
at Manila and Iloilo, will shortly return
home, his discharge on account of ill
health having been obtained yesterday by
The Call.
Corporal Healy, a son of Captain Healy
of the Bear, and whose work with pen
and pencil is well known to readers of
The Call, especially from his able letters
from Manila, enlisted in the First Cali
fornia on the opening of trouble with
Spain, giving up a comfortable home and
an assured position on this paper in or
der to serve his country.
His ability was speedily recognized, and
he was promoted to be corporal and af
terward given a special commission as
Superintendent of Public Instruction at
Manila. All this time he was delighting
and informing Call readers with his en
tertaining and newsy letters.
He was overtaken, however, by fever,
the nemesis of the Manila soldier who
never spares himself, and for months was
invalided, never, however, relaxing his
correspondence. The Call, as soon as It
learned his condition, unknown to him,
obtained his honorable discharge, and he
will have a chance to regain his health
and renew his literary work In sunny
California. _________________

toast in which he said he thought so much
of his associates that he would "bail" ;
them out If ever they got into prison.
The pun was voted so bad that he was let
off with a severe reprimand.
Previous to the banquet the election of
officers to serve for the ensuing year
was held, with the following result: Pres
ident. Joseph Magner: vice president, W.
A. Miller: directorsâ S. Anspacher, George
Morrow and Frank A. Somers.

TRIED TO CUT HIS THROAT.
John McC-eough, While Drinking and Despondent,
Attempted to Commit Suicide.
> J â¢ Fg M - 6 EouaH*'*^
JOHN McGEOUGH, manager for
Sullivan's shoe store on Fourth
street, staggered into the Tropic
saloon at the corner of Ellis and
Mason streets last evening with
blood streaming from two gashes
in his throat. He feebly asked for
a drink of whisky, and as the bar
tender started to serve him he be
came alarmed over the man's con
dition, and summoning a carriage
had the sufferer removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital.
After being placed on the operat
ing table McGeough was asked how
he"' had received the wounds.
"1 don't know," he tearfully re
marked. "I suppose some fresh guy
cut me."
Dr. Rumwrll stitched the wounds
and ordered McGeough removed to
the male ward. Detective Dinar.,
who was detailed by Captain Bohen
to find out whether McGeough at
tempted suicide or was cut in a
row, subsequently visited the Re
ceiving Hospital and closely ques
tioned the patient. McGeough per
sistently declared that he did not
know how he was injured. In an
swer to the questions of the detec
tive McGeough said he had heard
of the death of "Billy" Geimann of
the Police Department, which oc
curred yesterday, and as. they were
warm friends he felt grieved over
the rather sudden demise and
sought to drown his sorrow in the
flowing bowl.
He remembered having visited the
saloon at Ellis and Powell streets,
but had no recollection of how he
had been. cut. The police are satis

A BILL TO PROTECT
OWNERS OF HORSES
TO BE PRESENTED BY MASTER
HORSESHOERS.
It Will Compel All Workmen to Have
a Duly Attested Certificate of
Qualification.
The Master Horseshoers' Association of
this city has prepared a bill to be pre

regulating horseshoeing throughout the
State.
This bill, which is on the same lines as
laws in other States, provides first, for
the appointment of a board of examiners,
consisting of one licensed veterinary sur
geon, two master horseshoers and two
journeymen horseshoers. It is to be the

Thomas A. Burns, John J. O'Brien and
Edward D. Swift, charged with having
while in the School Department swindled
the city out of large sums of money, were
before Judge Cook yesterday. On motion

Footpads Held to Answer.
George Keagan and Fred Hall, the foot
pads captured by Policemen Herring and
Stanton, were yesterday held to answer
before the Superior Court by Judge Mo
gan in $3000 bonds each. They held up and
robbed Robert F. Voigt, a commercial
traveler, at California and Leavenworth
streets.
fled that McGeough. after worrying
over the death of Corporal Geimann,
vainly endeavored to commit sui
cide by slashing his throat with a
penknife.
McGeough begged that his wife be
sent for, as he feared he was about
to die. She was found in the late
residence of Geimann, consoling the
latter's widow. As McGeough's*
wife entered the ward where her
husband lay seriously injured he
arose from his cot, and pointing to
a citizen who had dropped in to see
another patient, declared that that
man had cut him. His wife, evi
dently realizing that he had slashed
himself, ordered him to "shut up."
McGeough Is a cousin of ex-Su
pervisor Sheehan. - The latter vis
ited him in the hospital and vainly
endeavored to induce him to tell
why he had cut himself. A drunken
soldier who was. with McGeough
when he Inflicted the wounds upon
himself was arrested a short time
after the would-be " suicide was
taken to the Receiving Hospital and
locked up in the City Prison. He
was too drunk to give his name.
It is said that McGeough and the
soldier met .yesterday afternoon
and visited a number of saloons in
the Tenderloin district. Just before
McGeough slashed his throat they
were seen staggering along Ellis
street. The police believe that Me-
Geough, after leaving the soldier,
went to a lodging house in the vi
cinity of Ellis and Powell streets
and attempted suicide.
Late last night the surgeons at
the hospital gave as their opinion
that McGeough would live.

HONORS FOR DICK TOBIN.
Finishes First in a Thrilling Hunt for the
Elusive Fox.
THE San Mateo Hunt Club is now figuring, not so much as a society organi-
zation as a producer of wet weather and heavy roads. On Monday last the
club met at Walter Hobart's country home, near San Mateo, and amused
the Blingumites with five races, run in mud. and rain. Banking on the suc-
cess of that performance, cards were sent out for a huntâ a fox hunt, at thatâ
which was to eventuate yesterday.
During the past week Hobart's keeper of the pack devoted all his spare time.
to the training of the hounds to get them in readiness for the hunt of yes-
terday. The hour of assemblage was fixed at 3:30 p. m.. and the place, back of
"the Blingum polo field. So much enthusiasm was displayed in the earlier part
of the week that a big hunt was anticipated.
The first on deck was the pack of well-bred hounds. Then came the hunts-
men, professional gentlemen from over the pond, with pedigrees as long as a
dachshund. The next to arrive on the scene was "Reggy," Hobart's man, all
resplendent in most proper dress. The rain began to pour down in sheets, the
dogs bayed and howled and yet no one of the real Blingum set appeared. At
last out" of a sheet of water "Dick" Tobin emerged and joined the patient
throng. Another long wait was Indulged in and no further additions being
made, the pack was let loose. L â  v ; V
The huntsmen had scoured the county just as they did last Monday, and-
with the same resultâ no fox; so they dragged an aniseed bag over the road to
Uncle Tom's. It was an exciting run, full of sound and fury. Dick Tobin fin-
ished first and the fox's tail Is his. The San Mateo Hunt Club will soon meet
again.
U. S. MILITARY
CABLE SYSTEM
IN THE BAY
Will Be Utilized for
Harbor Defense.
IS NOW IN FULL OPERATION
CHIEF SIGNAL OFFICER GREENE
SUPERVISED THE WORK.
Army Headquarters Are Now Con
nected With the Presidio, Angel
and Alcatraz Islands by
Telephone.
*- - I
Captain F. Greene, chief signal officer
for the Department of California, has just
supervised the successful laying of a sys
tem of a three-conductor submarine tele
graph and telephone cable for harbor de- j
fense in the bay of San Francisco, at a !
cost of $25,000. The cable is designated as j
a United States military one, and con- i
j nects the Presidio wharf with Point Ca
vallo and Horseshoe Bay, tide gauge
wharf at Lime Point reservation with the
post of Angel Island, and Point Kno on
Angel Island with Alcatraz Island wharf.
Captain Greene, In speaking about th*
work yesterday, said:
"This cable system will be of great con
venience in time of peace as well as war,
for It will connect all the batteries for the j
harbor's defense under one head. By its
means the department commander will be \
able to direct the fire of the Inner and j
outer batteries against any enemy ap-- j
' proachlng the Golden Gate. While the
cables will only be used in that direction !
, In time of war or for drllll, they will be
a great convenience In, time of peace, for
communication may be had with every
: post from army headquarters. The cable
is so arranged that if the telephone line
: Is overcrowded or out of order the tele
i graph can be used, and the system will
'. be operated entirely by the Signal Corps.
"Many years ago there was such a cable
here, but In course of time it became de
cayed and disarranged. 1 have tried since
18M to get the system rehabilitated, but
was unsuccessful until the war broke out,
and now I am greatly pleased that the
harbor is So well equipped. There are
three cables of about 4500 yards each.
When we commenced the work, which
: took two days, I had two reels, weighing
i 56,000 pounds each, one at the Presidio
and the other at Second-street wharf.
"With a gang of experienced men the re
sults were of the best. The weather was
iin our favor, and altogether it was a ;
pretty piece of work.
"The department will now communicate
with the Harbor and Pilot Commissioners
of this port to the end that the vicinity !
; of the cables may be declared publicly a I
! forbidden ancorage for all vessels, in ad-
I dition to the prohibitions and penalties
provided by an act of Congress."

SAN RAFAEL IN
A HUBBUB OVER
A DECOY STORY
Relatives Alarmed, Women Frantic and a
Lynching Party Formed by
Citizens.
Crushing Expose by The Call of the Way the
Telephone Company Betrays Its Patrons'
Interests.
IF there be a single person who doubts
that sending a message over the lines
of the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company and its companion in
iniquity, the Sunset Telephone and
'Telegraph Company, is equivalent to
! shouting the contents of that supposedly
private message from the housetops, let
him visit the city of San Rafael and listen
to what is almost the sole topic of conver
sation on the streets.
In order to strengthen its claim that no
matter how sac-red the message sent be
tween relatives or friends might be, or
how keenly they might desire to keep oth
ers from learning the subject of conversa
tion, the public would soon know all about
it. The Call had its correspondent at San
Rafael send a decoy dispatch, which was
1 never intended for publication, over the
wire last Thursday evening, the results
realized more than justifying the charges
of this paper.
"Not only did the decoy news leak out
in this city, through the Telephone Com
pany, but before the dawn of the next
day the whole of Marin County was in a
mate of the utmost excitement. As vic
tims of the leaking Telephone Company
â¢women were frantic with anxiety, rela
. I tives of persons believed to have shuffled
off. the mortal coil were flying to San
! Rafael from the surrounding towns, a
lynching party was in process of organ
ization, the Coroner was called out of
.bed- to furnish details of a bloody tragedy
and .by 10, o'clock the details of the phan
tom event had reached Petaluma on the
north. San Francisco on the south, Bo
lliias on the west and San Quentin Prison
.oh the east.
By a prearranged agreement The Call
.-.correspondent entered the telephone of
fice' at San .Rafael at 11 o'clock on Thurs
day evening and informed the operator
that he was about to leave town on a
'story and that the latter might expect
him to return in the course of two hours
with an item of the utmost importance.
At 1 o'clock he returned and asked the
operator to ring up the city editor of The
. 'Call In a hurry, as he had news of a ter
rible tragedy. This paper was then in
" formed, simply as a matter of private in
formation and for the purpose indicated,
' that a person living about three miles
' from San Rafael, who was recently
thrashed for being the alleged author of
' [certain anonymous communications, had
. 'been detected sending more of the same
kind and that a. party sent to administer
. a coating of tar and feathers had been
'.met- with a fusillade of burets, which re
.," sulted in two prominent citizens losing
" '.'their lives and one being mortally
â  wounded, while the person who had been
:, .intended as the victim of the irate parties
j-had- fled to. the foothills and was being
.pursued by two armed men.
â¢*i Although this precious piece of infor
.' mation â¢ was presumably- private, at 5
. o'clock the town was wildly excited and
"the .air' was idled with rumors of death
- and. disaster. Groups of excited citizens
tilled the streets, discussing the awful
â¢ (details of the mythical tragedy. Coroner
â  : Edward Eden was roused from his bed
â¢jand until noon his telephone line was
â¢. (kept employed in informing the public
; .that none of the dead had yet been
brought in. The evening papers were
â¢â . telephoning until 11 o'clock and inquir
.' ,ing -about the terrible affair. Several
. well-known citizens started to organize a
." lynching party to pursue the person that
â¢had fled to the hills, and when R. M.
" Donne received a business telegram the
Â° doors of his store were nearly torn off
-their hinges by the excited crowd hat
'rushed in after the messenger, thinking
the message contained some later details
of the trouble.
:â¢: At 8 o'clock the decoy news had reached
Ban Quentin and was known to all the
convicts at the prison. Guard Quaid, who
had been given a three days' leave of ab
sence, hesitated to take it in order that
: lie might attend â¢>-' funeral of one of
ihe supposed dead men. who was a bosom
, [friend. Before noon Conductor William
; 'Hunter heard the news of the affair at
'Petaluma.
: The news promulgated by the telephone
company was exaggerated to the extent
that, a prominent editor, who was only
casually mentioned in the article, was re
' ported to have been killed, as well as The
. Call correspondent A relative of one of
. the men believed to have died from a bul
let wound was nt San Quentin when he
received the news of his brother's death,
â¢nd was so overcome that he could hardly
enter the train which bore him to San

i Rafael to learn the details of the bloody
t encounter as well as the result of the
recklessness of the telephone company's
disclosure. Women in many cases were
in hysterics over the news.
About 11 o'clock one of the supposed
victims sauntered into town and was
' greeted as one returned from the dead.
His friends congratulated him and sev
, eral women wept while shaking his hand.
The gentleman was dumfounded to learn
that he was thought to recline on a slab.
I Several other "victims" made their ap
j pearance later, and soon all was confu
sion and mystery.
i Then followed the expose of the tele
: phone company. It was discovered that
at an early hour the operator had tele
\ phoned the details of the affair as sent to
I The Call to a Mrs. Duncan at Larkspur.
I She called up P. T. Burtchaell, the gro
cer, and told him what she had heard.
He sent to the telephone office for con
firmation and received it.
Then the story quickly spread, and as
fast as a person heard it he went to the
telephone office for confirmation. The
operator, who is required by law to keep
messages sent over the lines a secret and
had been specially cautioned in this in
; stance, let no person leave the office hun
gry for news. He told them all that The
, i all correspondent had been to the office
! twice and the second time had sent the
' story to his paper. Not a detail was
, omitted. His mother woke a citizen
mimed Dougherty up the same morning
and told him what had been sent The
Call. The operator on leaving the office
went to the saloon of Jacob Blume and
: g*e~e told a crowd of what had been sent
The Call. He was asked by a citizen if
i. were not violating the rules by thus
divulging what had been sent as a priv
ate communication ana said in response
that he had never been instructed not to
do so.
When the populace came to realize that
nothing of the decoy tale sent The Call
was true, the true reason for sending the
tale not at first being known, anger was
aroused against the person who had sent
the Â«__-- lt * After a while it came to
he known that the story was a decoy and
not intended for publication, and then the
sentiment changed completely. Main
people frankly admitted that.it was the
greatest expose of the criminal Ineffi
ciency of the telephone company ever !
made in the State. Nothing was published
of the occurrence on Friday, and all day
long came earnest requests from citizens
of Marin County that the company be
; shown up in its true light as a corpora
tion that permitted the interests of its i
patrons to be disclosed to the public even
after it had been warned of what was
going on and cautioned to chance Its
tactics. Â°
The company is also likely to find sev
eral suits for damages on its hands. The
gentlemen concerned in the decoy mes
sage assert that it was a legitimate prop
! osition on the part of this paper, but that
; when the company permitted the news to
i reach the public it became slander. The
: expose was the sole topic of conversation

Vetoed the Scalpers' Bill.
Mayor Phelan has vetoed the order
which prohibits the sale of theater or
opera tickets by any person without a
license. The reason for the veto is that
the license for this class of peddling has
been reduced recently from $300 to 525
The Mayor does not believe in permitting
the scalping of tickets and wants the
prohibitive license restored. -

EVILS THAT WILL BE REMOVED

FOR CONTROL.
Members of the Minority Seeking to
Inform Themselves on the Finan
cial Condition of the
Department.
The far-reaching effect of the Impend
ing classification of teachers out of the
School Department Is beginning to be un
derstood. It was at first thought that the
proposed reformation of the new School
Board would concern only the newly
elected teachers. This is not the fact,
however, as all teachers in the depart
ment, Irrespective of their time of serv
ice or their efficiency, are subject to the
new rule of the board, and may be
dropped from the rolls under the condi
tions that were fixed last Wednesday
night. The classification is not to be upon
a basis of merit but upon the attendance
in each class of each school.
By the orders of the board, the last
teacher appointed to a school must go
where the attendance Is not up to the
established standard. This means that
many of the teachers appointed by the
last board will go, but many will remain,
as they have been located in schools
where the attendance of children meets
with all of the requirements demanded by
the Directors. On the other hand, there
are many schools in which the teachers
have taught for years. These schools are
below the established standard, and can
not be raised to it. The teachers, there
fore, must go.
This problem has created a great deal
of uneasiness in the department, and some
of the older teachers are threatening to
institute legal proceedings to prevent the
board from taking action. It Is not be
lieved, however, that any proceedings, le
gal or otherwise, will interrupt the plan
of the board. The board is determined
above everything else to remove such evils
as are presented for example in the Jack
son Primary School on Stanyan street.
This school exists as an unwarranted ex
travagance created simply to provide a
place and a principalship for a relative of
one of the old Directors. Under the
scheme of classification adopted last Wed
nesday night this school would at once
be reduced to only two classes. Under
the plan suggested by Director Head it
would be abolished and several hundred
dollars a month would be saved.
To free the department from such evils
i as this school presents the Directors are
i fixed in their determination to proceed
even if some of the older teachers may be
â¢ Injured in the process. After the consoli-
I dation of the day and evening schools
' has been effected attention will then
ibe directed toward the special de
partments, which present a verita
ble nest of fraud. In the manlpula
lation of the evening schools the greatest
dishonesty has prevailed. Even under the
attendance limit of fifteen, fixed by tne
last board, these evening schools are
frauds.
When an Investigation was feared or
expected the rolls were "stuffed" and the
registers falsified. Teachers would at
critical times take into their classes chil
dren wherever they could be found. This
was done for a night or two until the In
vestigators were hoodwinked and then the
old laxity would be resumed.
The majority members of the board are
preparing now to place their favorites In
the department. Janitors, store keepers,
laborers and watchmen will be appointed
and the members of the minority in the
board can do nothing except to look on
and criticize within their limits. They
promise, however, that If the majority at
tempts to place unfit men in positions the
public will hear a vigorous protest. The
financial affairs of the School Department
are a closed book to the members of the
minority, and every diligence will be used
by the members to inform themselves
without delay.
The "club flush" believes, individually
and collectively, that questions of expen
diture may then be more intelligently
discussed, even If the discussion results
in nothing more material than emphatic
protest to the action of the majority. It
is evident, therefore, that the coming his
tory of the School Board will be a lively
one unless the minority is given at least
a small place in the government of the
department. The men who constitute the
minority are strong in numbers and ag
gressive. They are seeking nothing in
their own behalf and claim to have no
favorites to reward.
On the other hand, the majority re
plies that It seeks to establish no broad
line of division between it and the min
ority. By force of numbers it has the
right, It Insists, to the fruits of organiza
tion, but on all points affecting the gen
eral welfare of the department it asks the
co-operation of the minority and a har
mony of action that will be of substantial
benefit to the public schools.
A CHANGE IN LOCATION.
Koenig's .Removal to Larger Quarters
Necessitated by Increasing
Business.
About February 1 Koenig's shoe" store
will remove from the present location,
122 Kearny street, to more ample quar
ters on the opposite side of the street,
at 123 Kearny. In anticipation of this
j change of location Mr. Koenig, some
six weeks ago, inaugurated a clearance
| sale that resulted in unusual popular
approval. The attractive windows of
j his store were loaded with bargains
such as have never been equaled by
any shoe sale in this city. The result
was almost instantaneous success, and
for weeks crowds thronged the entrance
clamoring for admittance in an effort
to obtain a standard make of shoe at
i the astonishing prices that were put
upon them. While much of the stoca
was disposed of, yet considerable re
! mains to select from at prices that are
j even lower than before. Mr. Koenig
I proposes to equip his new store with
| only new stock and is making genuine
sacrifices and unusual inducements to
accomplish this purpose. This house
may justly be termed one of San Fran
cisco's pioneer business enterprises,
having been established for over thirty
five years and it carries a stock selected
from the output of only the most repu
; table manufacturers of this country
! and Europe. Mr. Koenig's new store
: will be thoroughly modern, beautifully
fitted and by Its attractiveness of feat
ure and quality of goods will continue
to expand the growing trade that has
necessitated this change of location. *
. Cashed a Bogus Warrant.
M. Metzger, a broker, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
for the arrest of George "Wilkins, a clerk
during the late election, for obtaining
money by false pretenses. Wilkins rep
resented himself as L. Peterson and ob
tained a warrant on the treasury, which
Metzger discounted. Peterson had a war
rant, which he cashed in me regular way.
Sunnyside Has Modern Ideas.
The officers of Sunnyside District Pro
gressive Improvement Club addressed a
lengthy communication to the Supervisors
yesterday. Many reasons were set forth
why the district should receive recogni
tion in the matters of sewers, light, fire
protection and proper school facilities for
the children of the district. v>

BULLET TEARS
OUT L. N. PEART`S
RIGHT EYEBALL
Shoots Himself in a
Lodging-House.
A WOMAN IS THE CAUSE
DIVORCED WIFE REPUDIATES
HER PROMISE TO FORGIVE.
Said to Have Accepted His Money
and Then Taken Up With a
Younger and Hand
somer Man.
"Weary and despondent, repudiated by
the woman who was once his wife, after j
she had promised to forget and forgive, I
Lewis N. Peart, at one time a wealthy j
builder and contractor of Colusa, tried to i
blow his brains out In a lodging house at I
304 Third street yesterday at noon. He
succeeded in inflicting a horrible wound
which the doctors say may or may not
prove fatal. The bullet shattered the
upper jaw and cheekbones on the right
side of the face, tore through the eye
ball and fractured the skull. The injur
ed man was removed to the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital, where his wound was
dressed by Its. Fitzgibbon and Sweeney.
The eye was torn to fragments by the
bullet, which had also been so shattered
that only a few small pieces could be
found. . -â 
The lodging house, which was formerly |
owned by Mrs. Peart, is now kept by |
Charles W. Barney and wife. Peart has i
been around the house a good deal of the
time during the last ft v.- days, and com
plained bitterly of the way he was being
treated by his former wife. -Yesterday
about noon he entered the house and go
ing to the lavatory fired the shot which
he intended should put. an end to his
troubles. The report ct the pistol was
heard by Mr. anu Mrs. Barney and by
John Walters. They found the old man
sitting in a bent position, with the blood
streaming from the ghastly wound in his
head. Officer John A. Ryan was on a
passing car, when Barney rushed out of
the house and informed him that a man
had been shot. He hurried to the lodg
ing house, where he was; joined almost
immediately by Officer Jerry Donovan.
Peart was still conscious, but refused to
talk, although when first discovered he
admitted to Mrs. Barney that he had
shot himself. .Lying in a pool of blood
near his right foot was a cheap live
chambered thirty-eight caliber revolver.
It held four cartridges and one empty
shell. The Barneys said they heard three
Shots, but there were no bullet holes in
any of the partitions and no wounds on
the man's person, other than the one ln
the head. On the way to the, hospital
Peart told Officer Ryan he hud shot him
self. -
Peart had lived at the Third-street
house for nearly three years until last
April, when he removed to 24 Turk
street, leaving Mrs. Peart in charge of
the lodging house. She soon after se
cured a divorce and Peart went to lowa
Hill, Placer County. He kept up a regu
lar correspondence with his divorced
wife, many letters from her being found
on his person when searched at /he Har
bor Receiving Hospital. Peart refused
to discuss the subject, but his friends
say he sent Mrs. Peart all his savings,
she giving him to understand she would
live with him again as bis wife.
Peart returned to San Francisco a few
days ago firm in the belief that every
thing had been arranged to his satisfac
tion. But he was doomed to be bitterly
disappointed. Not only did his wife re
fuse to have anything to do with him,
but It is said he learned that she had
taken up with a young and handsomer
man in the person of Walter Mise, a
young steam-fitter, with whom she is said
to be living at 1 Fifth street. Peart be
gan to drink heavily when he discovered
how he had been duped, and threatened
to kill both his ox-wife and Mise, but he
probably changed his mind and concluded
to kill himself instead. One of the letters
found in his pocket was dated December
30, 189S, and is as follows:
"Friend Lewis: 1 just received your let
ter to-day. Is George's birthday. Well. I
will meet you at the opposite place if
nothing happens. If I ain't there by 9
wait until half-past 9. As ever, a friend.
ELLA PEART."
The George referred to is probably
George Shlppley, a son of the woman by a
former marriage. Mrs. Peart sold the
Third-street house to the Barneys several
months ago and went to live at 137 Mont
gomery street. Recently she removed to
the lodging house at 1 Fifth street. She
is said to have purchased the place a few
days ago and introduced herself as the
landlady to a caller as late as yesterday
afternoon. When she learned that Peart
had shot himself, however, she disap
peared from view, and to all who asked to
see her the information was , imparted
that Mrs. Peart was not the landlady but
only a lodger; that she was very ill and
could not be seen. Her substitute was
determined to prevent her charge from
being seen and threatened to eject several
rather persistent reporters. The amazon
did all the explaining she considered
necessary. ' ' 'â  . "
"What do you want to bother Mrs.
Peart for?" she demanded. "Peart is
nothing to her. They were divorced a year
ago. He is no good and she had to take
care of him for the last four or five years.
They say he will get well, It's a pity he
did not. kill himself."
"Will she go to see him?"
"Go to see him? Indeed she will not.
She would not have him when he had
two eyes, and I am sure she don't want
him now that he has only one."
After the doctors had dressed his wound
Peart was asked about the shooting. He
declared he had not shot himself, but
further than that 'he refused to talk.
Last evening he was asked if he wanted
Ella, his former wife, to come to him and
he nodded his head eagerly, the only time
since he was shot that he exhibited the
slightest interest In anything.
Peart is about 50 years old and his ex
wife ten years younger. Mise, the young
mechanic with whom she is said to be
living in the Fifth street place, is hardly
more than a boy, being but 24 years old.
The police are satisfied that the old man
shot himself. There is nothing to show
that more than one shot was fired, other
than the statement of the Barneys that
they heard three shots, and they are be
lieved to have been mistaken in this re
gard. â 
LIEUTENANT ESOLA
CAPTURED A FRAUD
DARING ATTEMPT TO SWINDLE
MEN SEEKING EMPLOYMENT.
J. E. Gilligan Narrowly Escaped
Lynching at the Hands of His
Infuriated Victims.
J. E. Gilligan, alias De Reemer, a fresh
youth of 23 hard winters, was caught yea
terday morning by Lieutenant Esola of
the California street station, while en
gaged In playing a desperate confidence
game on several miners, who with diffi
culty were restrained from lyinchlng Gilli
gan.
The victims told the same story, and
there is no doubt that Gilligan deserves
to be severely punished. They were
brought Into contact with Gilligan
through the following advertisement:
WANTEDâ men for mine in Nevada, *2 and
board : fare paid. See agent room 2, 523
Kearny st., between 10 and 12 o'clock to-day.
About two hundred men out of employ
ment, the greater number of whom had
worked in mines, called upon Gilligan and
appned for the work. Among the num
ber was a miner named Rogers, who had
formerly worked as . a uetectlve. The
sharper told Rogers that he was superin
tendent of the Merrimac mine in Nevada
at Lone Mountain, eighteen miles from
Carun, and that on Christmas day all the
miners went on a spree and did not re
turn. He (Gilligan) had come to this city
to get men to fill their places, and to take
back two carloads of machinery for the
mine. He would take seventeen men
back with him, their fare to be paid by
the mining company and deducted from
their wages. The company had an agree
ment, he said, with the ra.iroad company
whereby the regular fare of JIS per man
would be reduced to _.
This story was plausible, and the men
swallowed it readily. T.en Gilligan pre
sented the gold brick. It was that each
of the accepted seventeen should deposit
$2 to defray his expenses at the Tremont
House until .Monday morning, at which
time he would start for Nevada with the
machinery and men.
Rogers became suspicious of the two
dollar proposition and reported his suspi
clans to Lieutenant Esola.
The lieutenant called on the sharper
and cross-examined him as to his pre
tensions. Gilligan broke down and ad
mitted that he was a fraud and was
placed under arrest and taken to the
California street station. When the min
ers learned that Olidgan was a sharper
and that he was under arrest they tried
to get him away from Esola for the pur
pose of killing him in the most expedi
tious way that came to hand, and it re
quired all the lieutenants adroitness to
convey his prisoner in safety to the jail.
When placed behind the bars Gilligan
told the lieutenant that he went to Cros
sett's employment office a few days ago
and paid a two-dollar fee for a job in
San Mateo County. He went to the ad
dress given him and found that some one
else had secured the position. He then i
returned to this city and while loafing in
the Cafe Royal met a man whom he know
by the name of Jim, who suggested the j
