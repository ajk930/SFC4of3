BLUEJACKETS AMBUSCADED
BY MATAAFA'S WARRIORS
Lieutenant Lansdale and Ensign Monaighan of the Philadelphia and Lieuten=
ant Freeman of the British Gunboat Tauraga Killed and Their Bodies
Decapitated by the Savages.
SPECIAL COPYRIGHTED CABLEGRAM TO THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.
AUCKLAND, N. Z., April 12.- On April I 800 of Mataafa's men ambuscaded 100 bluejackets near Apia.
The fighting was terrific, the American and British tars repeatedly beating back their assailants, who sought to
overwhelm them by force of numbers.
Lieutenant Lansdale and Ensign Monaghan of the United States cruiser Philadelphia and Lieutenant Freeman of
the British gunboat Tauraga were killed.
After the rebels had been driven off the bodies of these three officers were recovered. They had been decapitated
by the savage Samoan warriors.
Four marines were killed. Mataafa's loss was forty killed and a number wounded, these being carried off the
field by the rebels when they retired.
The bodies of Lansdale, Monaghan and Freeman, as well as those of the unfortunate marines, were buried with
military honors at Jlulinuu.
There is constant fighting with the natives around Apia, and the life of no European in the islands is safe.
Lieutenant Philip Van Home Lansdale was born in the District of Columbia February 15, 1858, and entered
the Naval Academy June 6, 1873, He graduated in June, 1878, and was promoted ensign in 1881, and after duty at

Germany Wants the Ameri

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April ILâ Lokal An
zeiger to-day prints an interview with
Dr. Raffel, in which he is quoted as
saying:
"The decision of Chief Justice
Chambers in favor of Malietoa Tanu
was partly due to the fact that
Mataafa is a Catholic, while Malietoa
is a proselyte of the English mission
aries. Mataafa at present is the only
King the Samoans will tolerate."
There has been a sudden veering of
views upon the part of both the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, Baron yon
Bulow, and the Emperor.
A Foreign Office official said to-night
to the correspondent of the Associated
Press, in energetic langauge, that Ger
many and Belgium would investigate
the commission's work, and insist
upon the American and British Gov
ernment unmistakably disavowing the
flagrant violations committed by Ad
miral Kautz and Captain Sturdee. In
the absence of a disavowal for Ger
many to join the commission would be
a mere farce. He added:
"When the commission starts it must
start on the status quo and not on a
status created by the illegal acts of
subordinates in Samoa."
More energetic is the official an
nouncement of the Hamburg Corre
spondenz, which declares that if Eng
land and America do not heed the dip
lomatic remonstrances made in Lon
don and Washington the remonstrances
will be fortified, adding: "Germany in
sists upon receiving full satisfaction
for the number of breaches committed
In Samoa."
The tone of the German press during
the last two days has been most bitter.
Inquiries made by the correspondent
of the Associated Press at the For
eign Office have elicited the statement
that nothing is known of the alleged
British annexation of the Tonga Isl
ands and It Is not believed such action
has been taken, as it is claimed it
would be a gross violation of the
Anglo-German agreement of 1886.

NEW YORK, April 11. â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Though the three powers signatory to the Berlin treaty have prac
tically agreed upon the instructions under which the Samoan
Commission will act, the administration will maintain a strong
American force at Apia.
The collier Brutus is going to Apia, where she will remain until
the collier Scindia arrives, when, if the situation permits, she will pro
ceed to Guam. The collier Abarenda will soon start for Pago Pago, where
she will take station as a guardship pending the construction of a coaling
station at that point. These colliers have fairly large crews and several
rapid-firing guns, and will be useful in case of another scrimmage with
the natives.
_t is expected the Samoan Commission will leave for Apia on the
steamer sailing from San Francisco on April 19. Mr. Tripp is now on his
way to Washington and Freiherr yon Steinberg and Mr. Elliott, the
German and British Commissioners, are in Washington. To reach San
Francisco in time, it will be necessary for the commission to leave this
city by 'Friday.
During the three or four months of the stay of the commission in
Apia, it will attend to the government of the islands, superseding Ma
lietoa, Tanu, the Municipal Council, the Consuls and the Chief Justice,
and their retention in office will be determined by; the report of the
commission.

THE POPE'S
HEALTH IS
RESTORED
Makes a Speech to the Car-
dinals Assembled to
ROME, April ILâ Pope to-day re
ceived the members of the Sacred Col
lege, who congratulated the Pontiff on
his restoration to health.
In his address to the Cardinals the
Pope, after expressing great gratitude
to the Deity for his restoration to health
and his thankfulness for the proofs of
affection from all parts of the world,
warmly eulogized the Czar's initiative
in calling the peace - conference and
hoped that it would lead to the settle
ment of all disputes between all na
tions by moral and peaceful means.
The Pontiff also dwelt at length upon
the church's mission of pacification,
"not only in the domain of conscience,
but in the public and social representa
tive here, a mission which the church
fulfills in proportion with the freedom
left to her action."
Continuing, the Pope said: "Every
time the church has intervened directly
in the serious affairs of the world it has
assured public welfare, and the Popes
have often stopped oppression and se
cured truces and peace treaties. Civil
ization-would have perished without
papal authority to vindicate the su
premacy of right over might. Oppres
sion may sometimes embarrass and
curtail the powers of religion, but amid
all vicissitudes the church pursues its
beneficent mission, which will embrace
heaven and earth. Pure humanitarian
ism could not insure lasting prosperity.
An attempt Is even now perceptible to
withdraw civilization from the influence
of Christianity."
The Pope concluded with bestowing |
his benediction upon those present in a j
firm, strong voice. Besides the Cardi
nals a number of Bishops and other j
dignitaries of the church were present. |
The health of the Pontiff was appar
ently excellent.

MANILA, April 12.â.
General Lawton's expe
dition captured the vil
lages of Pagsajan and Lumban
yesterday. The American troops
met no resistance in the former
place and only slight opposition
in the latter. There was one cas-
ualty among the Americans and
several among the insurgents.
Fifty of the latter were captured.
The mouth of the river, com
manded by the guns at Lumban,
was effectually blocked against
the entrance of gunboats. Shells
from the Laguna de Bai drove
most of the insurgents in flight
up the mountain side, but a
small force remained in an old
church, offering resistance until
it was rushed by the troops.
Six launches and two cascoes
were captured in the river. The
river's mouth â¢ will be dredged
and the obstructions removed.
Santa Cruz and Pagsajan are
now guarded by the men of the
Fourth Cavalry. A part of the
Fourteenth Infantry, with Gen

NO WAR MEDAL
FOR ROOSEVELT
Considered to \-\a\ie but Done His
Duty in the El Caney
Charge.
NEW TORK, April 11â Washington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Theodore Roosevelt will not receive a medal of honor in rec
ognition of gallantry displayed by him in leading his regiment up San
Juan Hill. This is the decision of the board which has been considering
the cases of officers and men entitled to medals, brevets, certificates of
â¢ merit and honorable mention for their conduct during the war with
Spain.
The board has decided Colonel Roosevelt, while behaving bravely,
only performed his duty in leading his men, as reward for which he re
ceived two brevets, and that he did not perform any action which
would entitle him to a medal of honor.
I was told to-day the board would recommend that less than twenty
five officers and men receive medals of honor. They performed acts of
gallantry not contemplated in their orders and which exposed them to
grave personal danger.
It is understood the board will submit its report within a few days
and will then be dissolved. A new board probably will soon be ap
pointed, consisting of Brigadier General Schwan and Major Carter, mem
bers of the present board, to report upon the cases of officers recom
mended for reward for gallantry displayed in. fighting against Filipino
insurgents.
the foothills to the right of the rail
road. Later the enemy attacked the
outposts of the Minnesota regiment be
tween Bigaa and Bocave, five miles
south of Malolos, killing two men and
wounding fourteen.
Simultaneously the outposts of the
Oregon regiment at Marilac, the next
station on the way to Manila, were at
tacked with the result that three Amer
icans were killed and two were wound
ed. The less of the enemy was ten men
killed and six wounded. The Ameri
cans also captured two prisoners.
Troops were concentrated along the
railroads as thickly as possible and the
rebels were driven back to the foothills.
The roadbed of the railroad was dam
aged, but it was repaired almost Im
mediately and traffic was soon resumed
through to Malolos.
It is supposed that many of the
rebels who attacked General Mac A
rthur's line of communication and who
were repulsed by the troops command
ed by General Wheaton were natives
who entered the region in the guise of
friendliness. They had seemingly se
creted arms in several places and fired
on the Americans from the bushes at
so close a range that they could be
heard talking. One of the Filipinos
yelled in English:
"We will give you damned Americans
enough of this before we are through."
The rebels undermined the railroad
at Marilao and unspiked the rails in
an effort to wreck the train while the
railroad gang participated in the fight.
The work of the rebels was discovered
and repaired before a train arrived.
General Wheaton is preparing to pun
ish the Filipinos.
The military gunboat Oeste, from the
lake, has brought thirty-two rebel
wounded, one Filipino and six wouHded
Americans to the hospital.
It is now known that ninety-three in
surgents were killed in the capture of
Santa Cruz.
DEWEY'S OPINION
OF THE FILIPINOS
' WASHINGTON, April 11â Admiral
Dewey has written to the Secretary of
the Navy as follows, respecting the
capabilities of the Filipinos:
MANILA, Feb. 23.â The good effects po
litically of taking the natives into the ser
vice of the Government have not been lost
sight of, and from the first large numbers
of them have been employed at the Ca
vite naval station as mechanics and la
borers in coaling and in manning tugs
and launches.
I regret to state that the latter experi
ment has been only a partial success, as
nearly all of the mechanics and laborers
left on the outbreak of hostilities between
the United States and the Filipinos, and
are now believed to be in Filipinos' ranks.
I am unable to state how much of this
I was due to intimidation and forcible im
pressment Into the army by the so-called
Filipino republic, but from the statement
of some few who returned and the fact
that nearly all those who live in the coal
lighters and turretsâ that Is, under our
immediate protection, have remained, it
would appear that intimidation was a
large factor in the disappearance of the
workmen. It Is well known that the Agui
naldo Government is a severe military
despotism.
"Although under the rule of the United
States the character of the natives will
certainly Improve, a sudden change is not
to be expected. A few of them might be
employed on transports and vessels of
that kind: indeed, the Filipino quarter
masters who have been serving on the
Nanshang and Zaflro since the purchase
of these vessels have always been Satis
factory, but because of their long asso
ciations with Americans and Englishmen
> they belong to a class apart from the
) great mapority."

LONDON, April 11.â Agoncillo, the
agent of Aguinaldo, who is still In
Paris, suffering from influenza, has
written a letter to the Associated Press
Baying:
"It is absolutely false that Aguinaldo
is willing to accept an autonomist sys
tem similar to that in India. The
Filipinos and their Government have
only one â absolute independenceâ
as the only source of general welfare."
PARIS. April 11.â In an interview
printed in the Patrie to-day, Agoncillo
was quoted as saying*.. "The Americans
have fully realized that they will never
subdue the Filipinos and that the
policy of Major General Otis has com
pletely failed. The Filipinos have re
solved to defend themselves to the
death. They have in their power 1500
American prisoners. The wet season
is arriving and fever will soon attack
the American troops and disorganize
them. During* this enforced truce we
are increasing the strength of our or
ganization. The cause of the Fili
pinos, therefore, is far from desperate."

QUAY SEEKING TO
BAR BANK BOOKS
Opposes Their Admis
sion as Evidence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, April 11. -In the
trial of ex-Senator Quay to-day his law
yers began what is regarded as the all
important contention in their fight for
his acquittalâ namely that the books of j
the broken People's Bank are not compe
tent testimony against the accused man j
and therefore should not be admitted in j
evidence. On the decision of this point j
rests the entire fabric of the prosecu
tion's case. Should Judge Biddle decide
the point well taken the commonwealth's
case will necessarily collapse.
In order to obtain the most effective
presentation of this phase of the defense
Mr. Quay- brought to his aid the skill
of David K. Watson of Pittsburg, one j
of the ablest attorneys in Pennsylvania,
ranking, in fact, with the best of the
country. Mr. Watson spoke on this sub
ject for nearly two hours this afternoon,
and had the almost breathless attention
of a room filled with the legal lights of j
the local and State bar. Many of these i
lawyers expressed the opinion that Mr. '
Watson made a very strong argument. ;
What its effect will be upon the Judge
remains to be seen.
The District Attorney opened tin pro
ceedings in this phase of the case by of
fering in evidence the books of the bank,
extending over a number of years, and
along with them the account books, j
letter-press book and letters from Sena
tor Quay and State Treasurer Haywood,
found in the desk of Cashier Hopkins af
ter that official had committed suicide. j
He read, a long summary of what the
books and papers showed and stated what
he expected to prove by them, to wit:
That through a conspiracy with Cashier
Hopkins, State Treasurer Haywood and
other State-Treasurers and possibly other
officials of the bank. Senator Quay used a
fixed amount of State money deposited ;
In the institution and received interest
on another fixed portion of the State de
posit. Much of the evidence offered by
the District Attorney was brought out at
the preliminary hearing on October 5
last. There was some new matter, how
ever, dealing principally with the amount
of money loaned by the bank to Mr.
Quay, and, during the past twelve or
fourteen years, the amount paid to him
and other State Treasurers on State de
posits.
Mr. Watson contended that the mere j
fact that bank clerks, with no personal '
knowledge of the truth of what they
were writing, entered certain figures in
a book, which figures purported to repre
sent interest paid to Senator Quay, was I
no proof that the money had been re- j
ceived by him or that there had been any j
intention to pay it to him. This argu
ment Is in line with the defense's con- i
tention that Mr. Quay was the victim of
Hopkins, who used the Senators-n ame to
cover up his own : illegal transactions.
Mr. Watson also attacked the indictment,
declaring it to be fatally defective.
Judge Piddle probably will decide to
morrow whether the books of the bank
are admissible. If he declares they are,
Mr. Quay's lawyers will next take up the \
memorandum books and letters belonging
to Hopkins and oppose their introduction
as valid testimony. Previous to the pres
entation of the bank books by Mr. Roth
ermell the examination of Receiver Bar-*
, low was concluded and ex-Judge James
Gordon, who, the adherents of Senator
Quay declare, Is responsible for what they,
term the conspiracy against their favor
it., gave testimony In corroboration and
explained Mr. Barlow's statement.
Mr. Barlow created a sensation by the
statement that he had broken open the
dead cashier's desk and taken therefrom ;
I the books and letters appertaining to the ;
: Quay trial at the behest of a mysterious j
i informant who spoke to him over the tel- !
ephone from Harrlsburg and said there j
was a plot on hand to steal the compro
mising documents that night. He was, â 
, he said, never able to learn who his mys
terious friend was. The fact was
f leaned from Mr. Barlow that the bank
books and letters were practically in the
control of Judge Gordon from April until
September of last year. He considered
this proper, as Judge Gordon was the con
fidential adviser of President McManes of
: the bank. -;;. â -â '::
Judge Gordon gave his testimony In a
quiet, convincing manner. He deprecated
the stories of conspiracy against Senator
Quay that have persistently been put Into
circulation, and frankly answered every
question asked regarding the use he made
of the papers while he had them. He ad
mitted that they had been photographed
at his suggestion, but merely for pur
poses of safety in the event of the orig
inals being destroyed. He also admitted
having shown them to David Martin, the
leader of the anti-Quay faction; to John
Wanamaker, a bitter opponent of Sena
' tor Quay, and to others, including a par
tial exhibition of letters to James M.
( Guffey, the Democratic leader of this
State, but not in the manner hinted at by
the defense.
Judge Gordon asked permission of the
! Judge to make a statement of his connec
: tion' with the case, but the entire array
of Quay counsel objected instantly, and I
j what undoubtedly would have proved In
teresting reading was thus shut off.

FORGERY OF
HENRY HAD
NO WEIGHT
Did Not Influence General
Pellieux Against
Dreyfus.
TESTIMONY OF GONZE
Admits That the Exile's Alleged
Confessions Were Only "Par
tial Avowals."
â  â 
Sr>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ PARIS, April 12*.â Figaro, con
tinuing its publication of the evidence
given before the Court of Cassation in
the Dreyfus revision Inquiry, gives to
day the beginning of General Gonze's
deposition. General Gonze told the
court that he received from Colonel
Sandherr toward the end of 1894 the
bordereau which came into the hands
of Lieutenant Colonel Henry. It reached
the latter piecemeal and was recon
structed by him with the assistance of
various officers. It gave rise to a long
and minute investigation by experts on
handwriting, with I the result that sus
picion fell upon Dreyfus.
When interrogated regarding the
communication of secret documents to
the court-martial General Gonze re
fused to reply, but said he learned in
directly of the confessions of Dreyfus
on the evening of his degradation, and
on the folio-wing day he (General Gonze)
took Captain Le Brun Renaud to the
Minister of War (General Mercier), to
whom Captain Le Brun Renaud repeated
his statements. At the same time he
(Gonze) addressed a letter to the chief
of 4 the general staff (General de'Bois
deffre), in which he alluded to the con
fessions as "partial , avowals, mixed
with reticences and falsehoods."
With reference to Colonel Picquart's
endeavors to substitute Comte Ester
hazy for Dreyfus General Gonze ex
plained that Picquart never told mm
Henry's document was a forgery, and,
in fact, Picquart had not seen it.
After describing how Colonel Pic
quart came to be sent to Tunis, the
witness reverted to the secret dossier,
asserting that it came into Picquart's
hands in August, 1896. On September
3 of that year, he said, Picquart pre
sented him with a dossier he had
formed against Esterhazy, together
with the Petit Bleu, which appeared to
him suspicious because it did not bear
a postage stamp and had not arrived
regularly addressed.
General Gonze declared General Pel
lieux was not influenced by the Henry
forgery. Interrogated regarding the
cipher telegram from a foreign at
tache, dated. November 2, 1894, he said
it looked suspicious, two different ver
sions being given, and the Foreign Min
ister decided to exclude it from the
Dreyfus dossier. In ? May of last year
the Minister for War wanted to obtain
this document, but M. Hanotaux, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs at that time,
refused to deliver it. General Gonze
said he had not seen the exact text of
the two versions, but he remembered
that Colonel Sandherr brought him one
, version containing the words "emis
salre parvenu." A few days later Sand
herr showed him an entirely different
text.
General Gonze declared he was ignor
ant of Esterhazy's relations with the
general staff, though aware of the im
prudences committed by Colonel Paty
dv Clam. â¢He assured the court he
knew* nothing of the relations between
Esterhazy and Sandherr and had found
no evidence that Sandherr paid Ester
hazy. ""V
KILLED HIMSELF WHEN
ORDERED TO PARIS
Locrimier's Suicide Followed by the
Receipt of an Anonymous
Message.
PARIS, April 11.â The suicide of Lieu
tenant Colonel Henry in the fortress of
Mont Valerlen, Paris, last August gave
Locrlmler, his secretary, such a shock
that his brain was affected and he was
placed on the retired list as a hopeless
invalid. Since that time the former ser
geant major of artillery has resided at
San Quentln, in a chatelet there, with his
family and his father-in-law. He recov
ered his health somewhat, but never spoke
of the Dreyfus drama, which evidently
preyed upon his mind.
Last Saturday he received a telegram,
not from the Minister of War, as was
first alleged, but an unsigned dispatch,
ordering him to proceed to Paris imme
j diately to place himself at the disposal
"de gui de droit" (one who has the right

rest of Saturday preparing for \ the jour

It is remarked as curious that through
out the whole agitation Locrlmler's name

no doubt, however, that he could have
i thrown some light upon, the affair, es
pecially regarding the mysterious death

did not point conclusively to suicide.
When Colonel Picquart was placed or!
trial last September, on a charge of re

asked for an adjournment on the ground
that the Minister of War had decided to
prosecute him for forgery and using
forged documents. M. La Boric. his
counsel. Indignantly opposed the adjourn

liver Picquart into the clutches of the
military authorities. The Judges of the
Correctional Tribunal decided to grant
the adjournment, whereupon Picquart,
as he was about to be led away to Im
prisonment, made the folowlng sensa
tional statement:
"This is perhaps the last time I shall
speak in public. I shall sleep perhaps in
the military prison of Cherche Midi.
ThereforÂ© I wish to declare if I find the

SHAFTER COMES
TO THE AID OF
ALGER AND EAGAN
Testifies That If Soldiers Lacked
Good Food It Was Their
Own Fault.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â Major Gen
eral Shafter was the principal witness
before the beef inquiry board to-day. His
statement differed little from his testi
mony before the war Investigation com
mittee. He had eaten the canned roast
beef. cold and found it not disagreeable.
The refrigerated beef was as fine as any
he had ever eaten. The men who suf
fered for lack of food had only them
selves to blame. If there had been mis
takes Congress, which provided the ra
tions and clothing of the soldiers, was
responsible. He admitted that he â¢ had
never heard of canned roast beef before
the war. While it was not very pala
table in the tropics, he thought it would
be very good in a cold climate.
Some of the Pennsylvania volunteers
gave direct testimony as to the tainted
character of the refrigerated beef and
the canned roast beef. One of them tes
tified that the beef aboard the Mississippi
had maggots in it.
Major General Shafter entered the
courtroom unacompanied, and all the
members arose to receive him. He de
tailed the main events connected with
the Santiago expedition in narrative
form. The quantity of supplies taken
was largely determined by the capacity
of the ships. He had no discretion in
the matter of rations. He took what was
sent to him by the commissary depart
ment. It was utterly Impracticable to
take beef on the hoof. He regarded the
proposition as absurd. Had he encoun
tered an active enemy they might have
lost a beef herd. In any event it would
have been imperatively necessary to take
the same amount of salt and cured meat
to provide against such a contingency.
After the troops were landed he ordered
all troops forward with three days' ra
tions, '_ne meat ration was not specified.
Each commander determined whether it
should be bacon or roast beef. He heard
no complaint of the canned roast beef be
tween the time of landing and the sur
render. He heard no complaints until
after his return from Cuba. Naturally,
in such a climate, it was not appetizing.
He ate it every day himself. The troops
were supplied with full rations of meat,
hard bread, coffee and sugar. There were
one or two days when the full ration of
coffee and sugar did not reach them, but
it was made up the next day. The ques
tion of supplying the troops was the dif
ficult one; t he-rest was easy. There were
no complaint" from Washington. The
health of the troops was fairly good up
to the time of the surrender. The sick re
port on July 16 would show but 1000 men
sick, but the troops had been weakened,
and after the surrender went down rap
idly. The first case of yellow fever was
reported on the 6th. He recalled only one
complaint against the refrigerator beef;
he thought that came from the Seventh
or Ninth Infantry.
He took great interest in the refriger
ated beef, and from his investigation pro
nounced it perfectly satisfactory. Sus
picion that it had been chemically treated
was never even suggested at that time.
He attributed the immense amount of
sickness to exposure, the exertions of an
active campaign and the climate.
Major Lee cross-examined General Shaft
er. In a report forwarded by Colonel
Roosevelt some complaints were made,
but he did not regard them as important,
as the emergency had passed. Major Lee
read from Colonel Roosevelt's report of
WOULD EXHUME
CHINESE DEAD
Sacramento Trustees in
a Quandary.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. April 11â The Mayor
and Board of Trustees are confronted
by an interesting problem. For many
years past it, has been the practice to
bury the Chinese dead In the Helvetia
Cemetery, which is the property of. the
city. Lots have grown to be of value
In the section of the cemetery occupied
by the Chinese, and notice was recently
given of the Intention of the authorities
to remove the bodies.
The Chinese are jealous of their dead,
and when the determination of the au
thorities was manifest the merchants of
Chinatown formed a pool and employed
counsel to guard against the threatened
desecration. The bodies number .about
500, and' under the law the city is enti
tled to a fee of $10 for every exhumation.
Mayor Land has signified his intention
to enforce the collection of such a fee in
every case, and there Is a prospect of in
teresting legal entanglements.
The Chinese, as is well known, have a.
custom of temporarily Interring the bod
ies of their dead in the local cemeteries
and then sending them back, duly tick
eted, to the mother country, where the
remains are supposed to enjoy a quiet
and peace not possible elsewhere. These
removals are made from time to time,
according to the ability of the relatives
of the deceased to meet the expense,
which is usually $45 in each case. includ
ing the $10 exhumation fee, transporta
tion and delivery to agents in China-
The Chinese Companies, with headquar
ters In San Francisco, have sent word
here that they cannot afford to ship the
500 bodies back in a batch and they ob
ject also to paying the $10 fee asked for
in each case. They have Informed the
local authorities that they will ship the
bodies in small consignments from time
to time If permitted to do so, but. they
protest against the arbitrary determina
tion of the authorities to remove the
bodies without consulting their wishes.
Major W. A. Anderson of counsel for
the Chinese, asserts that he will cause
the Imprisonment of every official in any
way concerned in such a step and he will
not stop even at the Mayor. He declares
that in each case the cemetery fee was
paid for the interment of the Chinese,
and nobody has a right to disturb their
bodies. _____________________ _â¢.'*Â»?-â ':
PROMINENT WOMEN
COMING TO THE COAST
Officers of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union to Visit
Santa Ana./
LOS ANGELES. April 11.â Mrs. L. M.
N. Stevens and Miss Anna A. Gordon,
president and vice president of the Na
tional Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, will attend the California State
Convention of the organization, to be held
on May 8 to 11 at Santa Ana. Mrs. Ste

5 a reception In their honor will be given
from 5 to 10 p. m. Mrs. Mary A. Kinney,
State president of the. Woman's Christian

will deliver, a discourse.
After attending the State convention,
Mrs. Stevens and Miss Gordon will go to

She is a musician of much ability.
the action of July 1. saying his troops had
no food on that day except what they
captured from the Spaniards.
"If they did not have food it was their
own fault," observed General Shafter.
"They were ordered to provide themselves
with two days', rations."
As to Colonel Roosevelt's statement that
they did not have adequate food or medi
cal supplies, that was a matter of opin
ion. They had their rations provided by
law. If the rations of the Rough Riders
gave out en route to Cuba it was the fault
of their officers, who should have drawn
supplies to keep ten days' supply on hand,
as he had ordered.
] Q. From your experience do you regard can-
I ned roast beef as a suitable meat ration for
| such a campaign?
A. I do not know of any substitute.
Q. Could corned beef be better.
A. Possibly it is not so good as bacon, but it
depends upon the individual taste. I myself
think there misht have been less meat and
more beans and rice. Campaigning in the
tropics was new to us and it was an experi
mental food. Certainly we all recognize now
that the rations were not well adapted to such
a campaign, but it was all we had and we
did the best we could. Congress provides the
army rations.
General Shafter detailed a conversation
with Commissary General Eagan about
the canned roast beef, which he (Shafter)
at that time believed was genuine roast
beef. Asked if after all that had occurred
he considered canned roast beef worthy
of a further trial, General Shafter reiter
ated his statement that he knew of no
substitute. His own preference would be
for clean bacon, but while uninviting and
not palatable he did not consider canned
roast beef unfit for food. Any canned
meat in such a high temperature that
when opened the grease would run off
would be far from appetizing. But he
would not therefore condemn lt. In a
cold climate he would regard the canned
roast beef as very good Indeed. To carry
fresh beef on the hoof he regarded as
absolutely out of the question.
None of the division commanders-
Wheeler, Kent or Lawtonâ had approved
of the ration officially. : v. -
"If there had been complaints to them,"
he said, "I hardly think they have re
ported it. They were sensible men. It
was all we had. Nothing could have been
done." jUPiiuy
He mentioned the opinion that 1 per
cent of the refrigerated' beef was thrown
away. At the conclusion of General
Shatter's testimony the court took a re
cess.
A. A. Kirk, a cook of Philadelphia City
troops, testified at the afternoon session
that he saw refrigerated beef aboard the
Massachusetts that had spoiled. In
Porto Rico the troop bought its own beef
on the hoof. He declared that one-third
of the canned beef he saw was unfit foÂ».
use.
John W. Springer of New Cumberland,
Pa., who acted as commissary sergeant
of the Governor's troop of Philadelphia,
testified that fully halt the canned roast
beef was unfit to eat.
Arthur W. Feight of Carlisle, Pa., also
of â  the Governor's troop, thought that
one-fourth of the canned beef was spoiled
and one-half unfit for use. Maggots were
found in the beef aboard the Mississippi.
Lieutenant Alexander Frank of Cincin
nati, commissary and subsistence officer
of the First Ohio, which was at Port
Tampa during June and July, testified
that the canned roast beef made the men
sick. As commissary officer he had re
fused a considerable quantity of the beef
furnished by Armour. It was tainted. At
Jacksonville, he said. Armour issued short
weight beef.
CONSOLIDATION OF
STREET RAILWAYS
Two San Jose Systems
to Be Combined.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. April 31.â San Jose and
Santa Clara electric railway and the First
street electric railroad will, unless nego
tiations now pending fail, be consolidated
in the near future, and San Jose will then
have one of the best systems of street
railways on the coast. Messrs. Henry and
Burke, owners of the San Jose and Santa
Clara road, have been trying to obtain
possession of the rival concern for some
time, and during the last few days ar
rangements have been nearly completed.
The First street road, under the owner
ship of Jacob Rich, became embarrassed
three years ago and It was placed in the
hands of Receivers J. W. Findlay and
Henry Alvord. â¢ Rich went through insol
vency and the road passed from his hands.
There is a first mortgage Indebtedness of
$200,000 and a second mortgage of $100,000.
Suit to foreclose the first mortgage was
brought, and yesterday Judge Fyland of
the Superior Court rendered a decree or
dering the property sold as an entirety
within thirty days. T. E. Johnson was ap
pointed commissioner to conduct the sale.
Out of the proceeds will come the costs of
the county, which are heavy. The decree
then provides that Receivers Findlay and
Alvord shall each have $250 a month from
the time their service commenced, which
is about three years; $2000 shall be paid on
receivers' certificates for rails purchased
and improvements made; $5000 to Jackson
Hatch, attorney for the receivers, and
$200,000 to the German Savings and Loan
Society of San Francisco, holders of the
first mortgage. 'The residue from the sale
is to be paid into the court for the benefit
of the second mortgage bondholder,. This
latter class will receive but little.
: It is pretty certain that the German
Savings and Loan Society will buy the
road whan sold, and in turn will sell to
Messrs. Henry and Burke. George Tour
ny, secretary of the German Savings
and Loan Society, and^eA_torney W. S.
Goodfellow have been In the city several
days conducting negotiations with Hen
ry and Burke. To-morrow Burke will go
to San Francisco to further arrange mat
ters. It is not known just what the
terms are. but it is thought to be a pay
ment of just enough to cover the costs
and first mortgage.
The First street road is valued at about
$300,000. although Jacob Rich claims it
cost $400,000 to build and equip ten years
ago. It is about fifteen miles long. It
extends the entire length of the city on
First street to Oak Hill Cemetery, with
branch lines running to Delmas avenue
and Into the Second and' Third Wards and
Bedding street. The road is in poor con
dition and much repairing will have to be
done..
The San Jose and Santa Clara electric
road extends from East San Jose to San
ta Clara, and is about five miles In length.
The consolidation will give Messrs. Hem y
and Burke about twenty miles of line. In
all probability transfers, will be given and
the people will enjoy the benefit of one
line, â  - â  -

the introduction in evidence of the $100,000 â¢
note which is the basis* of Mary Helen j
Murdock's claim to a large share of the â¢
estate of the late William Murdock j
failed to-day. After the arguments of
counsel on the point raised yesterday had
been concluded, Superior Judge Pirkey
ruled In favor of the plaintiff, and the
note was introduced as part of the evi
dence in the case.
Gawn Murdock, the plaintiff's husband,
continued his testimony. He said he was j
in Chico when the note was made in
September, 1577. When he went home a j
few days later he was shown the note. |
During the time he was in Chico and i
after the note was signed he met William
Murdock', and the uncle told him that he i
had been at the home of the witness and '
had made the note for $100,000 in full settle- -
ment of the accounts between himself
and Samuel Murdock, and had received
the $20,000 the witness had paid to Samuel j
Murdock a few days before. After
reaching hime Gawn. at his wife's re
quest, made a copy of the note, as his :
father had requested a copy. The wit
ness said that he saw many sums of I
money paid to William Murdock by his I
father (Samuel), these transactions run- j
ning from IS6I to 1877, the date of the j
note. I
After he returned home from Chico and |
made a copy of the note the original was
put into a glass bottle. This bottle was
sealed, put Into another bottle.and the
larger bottle placed in a powder-can and
burled in the stable, where it remained
for ten years. In 1887 the note was taken
up and taken to Sacramento.where a trade
was being negotiated for a lot of land,
the note to be used as part of the pur
chase price. The note was at this time
presented to William Murdock by the per
sons who were expecting to take it, and
William Murdock said it was all right
and would be paid at maturity.
The witness testified that William Mur
dock acknowledged the note in Sacra
mento in 1890. The witness positively
identified the note as the one he saw upon
his return from Chico. He was still on
the stand at the adjournment of court.

STOCKTON. April 10.â The outlook for

a rain, accompanied by any wind, would
beat the stalks down, and the thickness
of the vegetation would prevent the
straightening necessary for heading.

One Effect of the Peace Proc
lamation Issued by the
President.
Sr>ed_i Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters. Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 11.
One 0. tin- most important effects of
the President's peace proclamation will
be th disba_idment of the volunteer
army organized specially for the war
with Spain. In anticipation of this re
sult officials of the War Department
have for some time past been engaged
in the muster out of all troops enlisted
for the war, and this work has so. far
progressed that there are only* four vol
unteer regiments on duty in Cuba
These are the so-called immune regi
ments. There are no volunteers In
Porto Rico and Hawaii.
There are about 18,000 volunteer troops
in the Philippines. They have rendered
mo*st gallant and effective service in ,
the campaigns against the Filipino in
surgents and their immediate muster
: out would seriously Interfere with the
successful prosecution of military oper
ations now in progress.
It is said at the War Department that
no such embarrassment is apt to occur
in consequence or" the President's proc
lamation, as arrangements will be made
under existing law.- for the continuance
in service of all these volunteer troops
who may elect to remain in the Philip
pines. The law which called the army
into existence will be construed at the
,War Department to mean that the mus
ter out of troops in the Philippines will
be upon the orders of the executive,
and that in the natural. order of things
such a result cannot be accomplished
Within less than two or three months.
In the law for the promotion of the
efficiency of the army, passed just be
fore the adjournment of Congress,
there was a provision authorizing the
President "to enlist in the Philippines
officers and men, individually or by or
ganization, now in those islands, and
about to be discharged, provided their
retention shall not extend beyond six
months."
As a special inducement for the re
enlistment of these regular and volun
teer troops in the Philippines, the War
Department has decided in case of such
re-enlistment' that th. men will be al
lowed full travel pay on their return
to the United States, including a trip
by sea, as well as by land, to the place
*of their original enlistment. It is cal
culated that this travel pay allow
ance will amount to between $500 and
$600 in the case of each soldier who re
enlists in the Philippines. Besides
this, they will get credit for service
already rendered and will also receive
the two months' extra pay provided
for soldiers who rendered service out
pide of the United States.-
These special ' inducements, it is
hoped, will have the effect of inducing
most of the troops to- continue in the
military service for the next six
months, at least. In support of the
statement that the execution of the law
for the disbandment of the volunteers
will require several months' time, at
tention is called to th- conditions that
existed in the army at the close of the
civil war. There was a similar law
then directing the disbandment of the
volunteer army. The proclamation
declaring the war closed was issued
In October, 1866, and the regiments
still remaining in the service were
mustered out from time to time, the
last volunteer regiment to be mus
tered out being held until a
year and six months after peace
had been proclaimed by the President.
Under this construction a number of the
volunteer regiments may be retained in
the Philippines for some time, although
It is known that those who desire to re-
turn home will be allowed to do so.
ANAEMIA
Is a forerunner of consumption. It is a |

existed between the United
Status and Spain since April

RHODES TO COMMAND
THE YACHT DEFENDER
9
Famous Skipper of the Lasca Will
Have Charge of the Racing
Craft.
NEW YORK, April 11.â After full con
sideration of many names submitted,
those in charge of the old Defender have
selected as her skipper for trial races
with the new cup yacht and all else that
may be required, of her Captain Unas
Rhodes, a lifelong resident of the South
Side of Long Island, and a friend and
associate of those famous sailing
masters, "Hank" Haff, Norman Terry
and others. Captain Rhodes is in
the prime of life, and in the days when
John E. Brooks of the New York Yacht
Club was in yacht-racing circles with his
â¢noted schooners he was his skipper and
piloted them to victory. The triumphs of
the centerboard Lasca, built for Brooks
from Cary Smith's designs, are still vivid
ly remembered by the great body of
yachtsmen.
When the Lasca went to Europe in May,
1894. Captain Rhodes was ln command,
and so much ' confidence was reposed in
his ability and judgment that Brooks and
two friends sailed with the yacht.
Captain Rhodes . made the exceptional
passage with the Lasca of fifteen and a
half days to Fastnet from Sandy Hook
lightship, and in seventeen and a half
days was at anchor In. Gourock Bay,
Scotland, without losing a ropeparn. The
inability of Brooks to secure any races
for his notable craft while she was
abroad Is a matter of yachting record.
Captain Rhodes remained with Brook 3
until he sold, the Lasca .and went to
Europe to permanently reside. Since then
the captain has been in command of well
known vessels. j

The President took from the desk the
American copy of the treaty, hand
somely engrossed, bound in dark blue
morocco and encased in a black moroc
co portfolio and handed It to M. Cam
bon. At the same time M. Cambon
handed to the President the Spanish
copy of the treaty, also engrossed,
bound in morocco and encased in a
maroon-colored morocco box. There
were deferential bows as each received '
from the other this final pledge of
shown to be the case. If Admiral Kautz
found Mataafa, the self-constituted
King, with his thirteen chiefs, dominat
ing the affairs of the island, involving
the suspension of the functions of the
Supreme Court and of the municipal
council, formally and duly established
by treaty, then it was his duty, accord
ing to the State Department, to bring
the conditions at once to conformity
with the' treaty. If this involved the
dissolution of the provisional govern
ment there can be no legal complaint,
It is said, by any one of the three treaty
powers, who have bound themselves to
carry out and maintain the treaty of
Berlin. The fact that the three Con
suls at Apia, in a moment of excite
ment, sanctioned the establishment of
the provisional government, though re
gretted here, is not regarded as affect
ing the merits of the American and
British contention, as these three ofu
cials, it Is held, had no right to do any
thing in contravention of the treaty,
such as was involved in the suspension
of part of the machinery of the govern
ment provided for by that convention.
Some surprise is expressed by the
department officials at the misconcep
tion entertained in Germany of the
terms .of Admiral Kautz's proclama
tion, and It is pointed out that, accord
ing to the terms of the proclamation,
as printed here, Admiral Kautz did not
say that "all three Consuls had ex
pressed a willingness to annul the pro
visional government," but that a meet
ing of the Consuls had been called and
that a decision had been reached to
annul the provisional arrangement.

Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ LOS ANGELES, April Governor
Gage visited Los Angeles to-day and at
tended to considerable private business
that has accumulated â  since his' vacation
began. The corridor leading to his of
fice door swarmed at times with those
who desired audience; but the door was
securely fastened and entrance denied all
applicants. VHf-tt-B3SQ_
Although the Governor and State Sena
tor Robert N. Bulla have not met for sev
eral weeks, it transpires the Governor
probably will not reappoint Senator Bulla
Code Commissioner. Bulla, according to
those who speak knowingly, is not in the
best standing at present with the State
machine and administration. The law
creating the Code Commission provides
one of three members shall be a Demo-
crat. It Is said Bulla's successor may be
of that party. In carrying out this Idea
overtures have been made to Henry
O'Melveny and George Denis, both lead
ing Los Angeles Democrats, and lifelong
friends of Governor Gage. Bulla said to
day he and the Governor were to meet
soon to discuss code work.
"I do not know whether I shall be re
appointed or not," said Bulla in response
to a direct question; "and I emphasize
the fact that I have heard nothing about
ah extra session of the Legislature with
a guarantee for a caucus to decide > the
Senatorship before the call is officially
issued. Would 1 sign such a call? I can't
answer that question until confronted
with the conditions."
Governor- Gage denied to-day that he
had appointed Judge Van Fleet, M. M.
Estee and George J. Denis members of
the Code Commission or had made any
appointments whatever.
"I shall make out a list of my appoint
ments when I get back to Sacramento,
and I don't know now how long after that
! time arrives they will be made public,"
| said Governor Gage in an Interview.
The exact date for Governor Gage's re
i turn north is not decided. He is reported
j as saying it may not be this week, as he
Is not well, while an Intimate friend de
clares the Governor will start to-morrow
night. The "push" is disconcerted, as it
seems impossible to reach the executive,
much less locate his movements with ac
curacy.
California's Congressional delegation

REPORTED DEATH
OF A DEFAULTER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' REDDING, April About a month
ago a , letter bearing Peruvian postage

went back to Modoc County announcing
the death of the defaulter' in an out-of
the-way place in Peru. Madden had been
.working ln the mines and accidentally cut
his knee, dying in a short time of. lock
jaw. The letter was written to acquaint
his family with the fact.
While there is no doubt from the post
mark and stamps that the letter was orig
inally mailed from Peru, the* people of
Modoc County receive the -reported -news
i with incredulity. The defaulter. Madden,
has been "heard from" at so many points
which afterward turned out unauthentic
that the people who lo?t $30,000 by the ex-
Treasurer's manipulation are loth to be
lieve he has been located or that he is
dead. .â -â >.
A â¢ few months ago some detectives
''worked" the Modoc Supervisors for $200
under the plea that they -were shadow
ing Madden in New Orleans and needed
the money to effect his capture. The
money was sent forward, the detectives
clapped their man in jail and sent on his
photograph for identification. It bore no
llkenesÃ to Madden, but Modoc County
was out $200 just the same.
At various times Madden has been
"heard from" at Honolulu, at Hongkong,
at Auckland and in the Coolgardie gold
fields. The letter from Peru, however, ap

SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 11.â con

and citizens of Pana, including Chief of
Police Kleley, City Attorney J. H. Mor
gan, S. E. Smith of the Pana Gazette
and Jacob Swallow of the Pana Palladi
um, in regard to the situation in that
city. A heated controversy arose be
tween the Governor and Mr. Smith over
the question of removing the troops from
Pana, the result of which was that Mr.
Smith was ordered to leave the room.
Governor Tanner asked Sheriff Downey
why he left Pana as he did to take a
prisoner to Taylorvllle when he had 200
armed deputies In Pana. The Sheriff ac
knowledged that many of Ms special dep
uties were as anxious as anybody to kill
the prisoner. To this the Governor said:
"You fell down when you left the scene
of battle and left your deputies without
a commander. I do not think that you
are capable of maintaining order and I
think if you had been left in charge there
would have . been a more terrible mas
sacre. It was very evident you had mis
represented the situation to me, and I
took the responsibility upon myself to
send troops',, and I have instructed that
all persons shall be disarmed."
Sheriff Downey soon afterward prac
tically admitted it was his purpose, with
the aid of the special deputies, to assist
the union minerÃ ln getting the colored
men out of Pana and preventing other
colored men coming in.
The Governor told the delegation that
he would take the troops away as soon
as order was restored.

NEW YORK, April 11.â tempo
; rary superstructure of the big Wil
lis-avenue bridge now being built

received injuries of a more or less seri
ous nature. The dead are:
M. LEWIS BEATTIE.

CELEBRATES HIS
TENTH MARRIAGE
Remarkable Record of a Pendleton
Judge in Matrimonial
Ventures.
PENDLETON, Or., April Justice Peter West of this city to-day
gave out to newspaper men the peculiar story of his tenth courtship
and the announcement of his tenth wedding. The Judge has to his
credit nine wives, from the last of whom he parted a week ago, the
court giving her a decree of divorce. He was the plaintiff, but the de
cree went to her. Mrs. West was married the following day to J. C.
Jones of this city, the couple going to Baker City to live, It was the
fourth marriage for her.
Judge West then, according to the story of his own telling for pub
lication, wooed Mrs. Pauline Miller, whom he had formerly courted,
and on Sunday evening made an agreement with her that a game of
cards should determine whether they be married to-day, next Monday,
or wait six months. Judge West declared that if he lost he would
marry her anyway, and so the game commenced. It was casino and
the Judge was to beat her three straight games or the wedding would
be postponed. He won and so the wedding took place to-day. Judge
West saying:
"This is my last matrimonial venture. I have accomplished my am
bition and have rounded out a romantic career of ten marriages and the
attendant troubles and joys. Henceforth I will settle down in con
tentment."
Mrs. Miller is possessed of considerable property and the Judge him
self has a comfortable amount of lands and money laid by from his prac
tice as a lawyer.
The superstructure connected the
north shore sustaining wall with a pier
and was a flimsy affair, stretching 300
feet across deep water, built in three
sections, one above another, to a height
of about sixty feet. Over this a massive
traveling crane or carrier was operated.
Twenty-five to thirty men were em
ployed on the structure when the col
lapse occurred. A heavy load of steel
beams was being sent out on the crane,
when the timbers gave way and the
entire structure went down with a
crash. As the supporting timbers be
gan to give way the heavily laden
crane ran rapidly forward for a short
distance and toppled into the river. As
it went down the upright crashed into
the workmen, striking the Delaneys
and Beattie, killing them instantly, and
terribly mangling their bodies.
Many of the men were carried down
in the wreck. Only a few succeeded in
getting to the pier, the majority either
falling into the water or into the tangle
of iron and woodwork.

The Grand Council degree was conferred
upon forty past councilors, and then the
presiding officer. Grand Councilor Max
Boehm, read his biennial report, an inter
esting document, giving a clear resume of
the work of the order in the past two
years am' offering a number of valuable
suggestions. â 
i Grand Recorder Willis also read his re- I
port. a^caicfully arranged and detailed ac- j
count of the condition of the order. From i
this II appears that by a combination of j
causes, failure to comprehend the change I
in the laws and many deaths, there was |
for a time a decrease In the membership, !
but of late, by reason of a better under- j
standing of the principles of the order
and renewed confidence, there has been a
noted addition. The membership at the ]
close of 1898 was 5095, distributed in 138
lodges. During the last term a number of |
weak lodges were consolidated with j
stronger councils with beneficial results.
The finance committee's account shows '
receipts' in the past two years, including
balance on hand, 517.471 32; disbursements, !
$13,069 99. leaving a balance of $454. __. an j
excess of $2.35 33 over the amount at the |
close of the previous Grand Council.
A resolution offered by A. G. Baker that !
hereafter, out of respect to the Grand j
Army of the Republic, the Women's Re- '
lief Corps, the Ladies of the Grand Army
of the Republic and the memories of the |
soldiers of the civil war and the war with
Spain, that no excursion, picnic or enter- j
tainment in the name of the order be '
given on Decoration Day, was adopted by I
a rising vote.
At the afternoon session the recom- '
mendations ol the grand councilor, that
there should be more fraternity among |
the members and that there ought to be
continued visits by grand officers, were !
adopted.
A. recommendation to levy additional as- j
sessments if necessary in order to meet j
obligations was, after a lengthy discus
sion, referred to the supreme representa- I

DEATH TAKES AN
IRISH PATRIOT
Thomas Baines, Once a Fenian Leader,
Has Passed From Earth.
CAPTAIN THOMAS FRANCIS O'MALLEY BAINES, Irish patriot
and Fenian conspirator, has gone to his long home. About a week
ago he. was taken to St. Mary's Hospital suffering from paralysis,
and Monday morning death stopped the heart whose every throb
has been a prayer for the freedom of old Ireland. All day yester
day the body lay in the parlor of the Pacific Undertakers on Mission street
with a bunch of g_-een shamrocks "on the now quiet bosom, and hundreds
of Irishmen who had lived through the stirring times of the Fenian up
rising came to take a last look at all that is mortal of one who had been
a leader and a plotter in the lost cause.
For years Captain Baines has been a familiar figure along the city
streets. He once made a vow that he would never cut his hair until Ire
land was free, and his curly brown locks hanging over. his shoulders at
tracted general attention.
In his native land he was known as a schemer of rare ability, with a
certain reckless abandon. The great leaders of the conspiracy selected him
as a man capable of performing most dangerous and difficult tasks. So it
happened that after the arrest of "The Pagan" O'Leary, Baines was as
signed to the task of organizing the Irishmen in the English array.. His
efforts in this line were crowned with success, but in 1563, shortly after the
suppression of the Irish Papal newspaper, he was himself arrested and
charged with treason. He was tried before Judge Kough and sentenced
to ten years' servitude in the penal colonies of Australia.
After serving five years he was pardoned by the Queen, and in 1572 he
came to this country in company with several compatriots. The Hlbernia
Rifles was an' active organization at that time, and Mr. Baines joined them,
and finally rose to the rank of captain. After the organization was dis
solved he kept his green uniform and sword, and on St. Patrick's day. ho
would wear them and go calling on his f riends. For many years he sup
ported himself by selling books, one of which was a biography of his life,
entitled "My Life in Two Hemispheres," in which the history of the Fen
ian uprising was told as he himself saw it. - -
He was married in 1877, and was the father of two children, Robert Em
met, now with the army in Cuba, and Thomas Addison, a lad of 15, who
lives at the home on Ivy avenue. Captain Baines has left this country but
once since his arrival in 1572. That was in I**2. when he paid a visit to
Australia and brought back with him the bones of Patrick Keating, an old
Irish compatriot, who was transported with him to Australia. It has
always been his intention to pay a visit to Ireland and carry Heating's
bones there for interment.
The deceased was 54 years old, and a native of County Mayo, Ireland.
The funeral will take place from the parlors of the Pacific Undertakers at
8:15 this morning, and from the Church of the Sacred Heart at 9:30.
PILOT COMMISSION
ON A LEGAL SHOAL
CALLED ON ATTORNEY GEN
ERAL TO TOW THEM OFF.
Misunderstood the Law Chart Rela
tive to the Payment of the
Secretary's Salary.
The members of the State Board of
Pilot Commissioners have been studying
the law, and, as might be expected, they,
overlooked some submerged legal rocks
and statutory shoals not down on any
chart that they had ever examined before.
To begin with, it was found that all of
the expenses of the office and salaries
must be paid out of the money received
from the pilots, the law stating that the
latter must pay Into the commission 5
per cent of all moneys received by them.
The Commissioners also found that the
secretary's salary was not to exceed $250
a month. As a matter of deductive rea
soning they concluded that If the Com
missioners had to pay the secretary out
of the receipts of the commission it was
no concern of the lawmakers how much
the secretary was paid. Hence the fact
that the lawmakers had set the maximum
amount that the official clerk should re
ceive surely Indicated that the Commis
sioners had only to fix the salary and the
same was to be paid by the pilots or out
of the State treasury. Ergo, the full 5
per cent received from the pilots would
go Into their pockets after office and in
cidental expenses are paid. In order that
no mistake should be made, C. H. S.
Pratt, chairman of the board, addressed
a letter to Attorney General Tirey L.
Ford,- in which he asked: "Must the sal
ary of the secretary be paid from the 5
per cent commission received by the
board or from the receipts of the pilots?"
Mr. Ford in his answer called attention
to section 2460 of the Political Code, which
provides that "every pilot of the harbors
of San Francisco, Mare Island. Vallejo
and Benicia must once In each month ren
der to the board (of Pilot Commissioners)
an account of all moneys received by him
or on his account and pay 5 per cent
thereof to the board in full compensation
for Its official services, for the services of
its secretary and treasurer and all inci
dental expenses."
Mr Ford concluded by saying that no
more can be collected from the pilots
than the 5 per cent provided by law, and
the section of the Code quoted made it
necessary that the Commissioners pay
their clerks out of this commission.

SEEKS AN INVESTIGATION.
Charles A. Wetmore 'Asks for Scien-
tific Inquiry as to the Preserv
ing of Food Products.
The general discussion over the ' pre-
I serving of meats, wines and other food
I products owing to the disclosures regard-
I ing the use of "embalmed" meats in the
! army was brought to the attention of the
State Board of Trade yesterday. Colonel
John P. Irish presented a letter written
by Charles A. Wetmore. In this Mr.
I Wetmore suggested that an Investigation
be held with the co-operation of scien
tists to determine the nature and effects
lof different methods. From this would
j flow information to guide all legitimate
| efforts to enlarge trade facilities and to
, enlighten legislative and municipal au
thorities in restraining dangerous prac
tices. The letter cites the smoked hams
of commerce as specimens of embalming
j and medical treatment. It also says the
practices of chemically treating meats
; similar to those figuring in the investiga
| tion of the Army Commission are -common
i in the local butcher shops and with re
spect to salted pork, bacon, ham and
corned beef. Mr. Wetmore asks for the
abandonment of all secrecy In such meth
ods and honest inquiry as to their merits
or demerits.

I of the Treasury with his favorable rec-

â  1: _
Johnson-Locke Mercantile Company
Given the Agency for the
Pacific Coast and
[ the Orient.
In a recent issue of the Commercial
Union there appeared the following:
A new corporation ' called the Royal Baking
Powder Company â¢ was incorporated at , Tren
ton, X. J., March 1, with a capital stock of
$20,000,000. The company Is. to deal ln baking
powder, cream of â  tartar, tartaric acid and
other preparations. The incorporators are
James C. Young of Jersey City, N. J.; L.
Bertram Smith of Tonkers, N. X., and Henry
C. Demorest, Samuel B. Lawrence and Sumner
W. White of New York City.
The company represents a consolidation of
the Royal Baking Powder Company of New
York, the Cleveland Baking Powder Company,
the New York Baking Powdar Company, tha
Price Baking Powder Company and the Powder
Chemical Company of New Jersey. In all of
these corporations William Ziegler has been
Interested, and his interest in the new company
is estimated to reach at least $10,000,000.
The control of the baking powder output in
the United States will be ln the hands of the
new company. The Royal and the Cleveland
companies have for a long time been rivals in
the East, while the Price Baking .Powder
Company has controlled the "Western market.
The companies now consolidated will continue
to be operated under their present names,
their identity not being swallowed up in that
of the new corporation. It is not improbable,
however, that after the new corporation has
been fully organized the offices and manufac
turing plants of the various companies may
be concentrated or at least reduced In number.
It Is reported that several of the men Identi
fied with the Royal Baking Powder Company
will retire from business, although younger
members of the family will be active in the
company. .
About the time the new company was
formed Frank S. Johnson, president of
the Johnson-Locke Mercantile Company
of this city, and Mrs. Johnson started
East for ah extended tour of Europe.
While In -New York Mr. Johnson met the
promoters of the big corporation and the
result was his company was appointed
the agent of the Royal Baking Powder
Company for the Pacific Coast. British
Columbia; Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan
and China. This and other business ar
rangements necessitated Mr. Johnson's
immediate return home.
"The new company," said Mr. Johnson
yesterday, "was formed for the purpose
of more effectively fighting the concerns
that have been flooding the market with
adulterated or 'alum' baking powders.
It includes all the old established com
panies in tilt- country and the biggest
cream of tartar works as well. The sole
object is to crush those companies turn
ing out 'alum' powder. Under the new
management there will be no change of
policyâ same liberal treatment of the
trade' that characterized the old com
panies' dealings with the trade will con
tinue."
Mr. Johnson also secured the appoint
ment of his company as Pacific Coast
agent of the new soda coritblne, which
controls the trade of the United States,
as well as the agency, for .the sardine
combine controlling -the entire American
output, and the Western Glucose Associa
on - , , , ,
Although Mr. Johnson says the baking
powder combination is for the single pur
pose of fighting the "alum" companies,
there Is an impression in local trade cir
cles that the price of this baking powder
may be advanced before long.
Hugo Kiel, general manager of Gold
burg, Bowen & Co., said the combine
practically controlled the trade and there
might be a trimming, of discounts which
would necessarily advance prices. His
company had received a hint to lay in a
supply of baking powder at once, but
had not acted upon it yet.
JORDAN AND THE SEA LIONS.
Will Discuss the P_oject to Extermi-
nate the Beasts. .
The Fish and Game Commissioners are
receiving quite a number of letters ac
cepting the invitation to attend the meet
ing at which will be discussed the propo
sition to thin out the large sea lion herds
that are found along the coast. Nearly
all are in favor of the project, believing
that If something of the kind Is not done
before very long the salmon and other
fish interests will suffer much from the do.
structive beasts. Those interested In a
commercial way present valuable data as
to the destructive habits of the sea lions,
and express the hope that the work of de
creasing the herds will not be deferred to
another season. Some opposition- was ex
pected from Professor David: Starr Jor
dan, who it was believed would be in op
position from a sentimental standpoint,
In reply to the letter inviting the pro
fessor to be present at the meeting, the
learned gentleman sends the following:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 10.
Alex. T. Vogelsang, State Fish Commission,
Mills Building, San Francisco, Cal.â Sir:
I will try to be present at your meeting If
possible. I may say, however, that the sea
Hon Is a fish-eating beast. No one . has yet
studied his habits fully enough to know how
many or what fish are devoured by him, or
whether the herds located about the bay make
any appreciable reduction in the salmon run
ning there. I do not know anything definite
as to the herd's increase.
You will notice that there are two species
of sea lion, the small black one and the large
yellowish one. The large one breeds at Ano
Nuevo Point and on the Farallones. No.ani
mals breed on the Cliff rocks. These are
simply the young driven out from the rookeries
who haul out there until they get big enough
to- fight their way Into the. breeding, grounds.
I think that the relation of these, herds' and
their, effect on the fishing in and about the
bay ought to be thoroughly Investigated be
fore anything is done. Very truly yours,
v DAVID S. JORDAN.

FIVE MONTHS'
DELAY IN THE
GRAIN CASES
No Relief for This
Year's Crop.
MORE FLAT-CAR STATISTICS
ALL THE EVIDENCE MUST BE
PUT IN SOON.
Railroad Company Will Not Dismiss
I the Case, but Will Nurse It
Along the Cal- ;â¢ :
W_ endar.
After a delay of many weary months
waiting for the Southern Pacific Company
to present its evidence to the court and to
s.how cause why the reduction in grain
rates should not go into effect, action was
taken in the United States Circuit Court
yesterday which puts the case back an
other five months, until after the com
ing wheat crop this year in California
will; have been harvested and stored,
leaving the California farmer without the
relief In the shape of a reasonable freight
rate which he has been so fervently pray
ing for.
For several months past, at fitful in
tervals, dependent upon the changes of
the moon' and the tidal fluctuations of the
Herrin mentality, the attorneys for the
Southern Pacific Company have been tak
ing testimony before Master in Chancery
Heacock in the Appraiser's building on
such vital points as the total number- o.
flat cars owned by the company and the
exact number of screws and bolts in the
tool houses along the route.
Several times the cane has been- called
In the Circuit Court for hearing and. on
each occasion the attorneys for the great
corporation have pleaded that they need
ed more time In which to put in their
evidence and continuances have been
granted, only to be followed by a re
newal of the request for delay.
The attorneys for the Commissioners
appeared in the Circuit Court yesterday
and protested lit the name of the people
against any further continuances. They
insisted that the railroad people should
at once close their case so far as the tak
ing of testimony before the Master in
Chancery was concerned, and that' the
Railroad Commissioners should have an
early opportunity to present the evidence
sustaining the contention for a reduction
of the rates.
The railroad company was not repre
sented In court â¢ and Attorney General
Ford, Robert Y. Hayne and United States
Assistant District Attorney Woodworth
appeared for the Railroad Commission
ers. They urged a speedy end to the case
and after consultation the court made the
following order:
Case continued for the term, and on
motion of defendant's attorneys and
upon good cause shown, it is ordered
that the period within which the
plaintiff is allowed to introduce evi
dence in the above entitled cause be
and the same is hereby fixed at four
months from the 4th day of May, 1899,
and that the defendant be allowed
said period within which to introduce
evidence in said cause and on their
part, and one month thereafter in
which to rebut the evidence that may
be introduced by the complainant, and
that no further time be allowed either -
party thereafter in which to introduce .
evidence in said cause. â¢ -;-' .
Thus the farmer will not reap any bene
fit this year from any legal action that
may be had in the matter, as by the time
that the evidence is put in the wheat
crop will have passed out of the hands
of the grower.
When the ? four months shall have
passed the indications are that the rail
road people will seize some pretext for
another postponement, so as to carry the
litigation over until the crop of: 1900 shall
have been harvested and hauled at the
old rates.
It has been authoritatively stated that
the Southern Pacific Company will not
dismiss the suit, and the issue bids fafr
to grow moldy In the courts before the
long-suffering grain grower can hope for
any relief.
CHADBOURNE SAYS HE
HAS NOT BACKED DOWN
INTENDS TO CONTEST RUDOLPH
HEROLD'S SEAT.-
Says the Fight for the Harbor Com
. missionership Is a Friendly
Matter Anyway. ; ~
When the Harbor Commisioners, by
electing ' William D. English secretary
of the board, blocked the scheme of Gov
ernor Gage to seat Colonel F. S. Chad
bourne as a member of the board, there
by forcing . Rudolph . Herold, the sitting
member, into the position of contest
ing for the. seat, Colonel Chadbourne an
nounced that he would at once begin ac
tion to oust Herold.
But no such action has been com
menced yet, although some time has
elapsed, and people are beginning to
wonder what Colonel Chadbourne In
tends to do in the matter.
There have been many rumors that he
would do nothing; that the Governor's
action in declaring Herold's seat vacant
and appointing Chadbourne to the posi
tion was merely a bluff, which if it
could be made to stand good would give
Gage control of the patronage of the wa
ter front and enable him jn a measure to
help out his . friend, "Mexican Dan"
Burns. It has been said that Chadbourne
is fully aware of the nature of the bluff,
and while he would have been glad to
drop Into the seat and let Herold make
the fight for it, he has small liking for
making the contest himself, and was in
clined to let the whole matter drop.
Colonel Chadbourne was asked yester
day what he Intended to do about lt, and
seemed to* regard the entire affair as of
little or no Importance.
"The matter is in the hands of my
lawyers, Knight & Heggerty." said
Chadbourne, "and when fliey have pre
pared the papers I suppose they will be
gin proceedings to establish my title to
the office. When will the suit be filed?
Oh, I don't know exactly; in a week or
ten days; maybe two weeks. There's no
hurry about It, you know. - It's all a
friendly affair, anyhow. I've known
Herold for a good many years, and he's
a very decent fellow. What's that? Oh.
yes; I'll push the fight to a finish, all
right enough, but. there's no need of
rushing these matters. You know how it
is in a case of this sortâ one of these
political contestsâ it's all done in friend
liness, and it doesn't make much differ
ence to anybody but the parties directly
interested which way it turns out. That's
the way with me. If the other fellow
wins, all right; if I win. why, I'm the
lucky one. We'll all be happy whichever
way the thing terminates."
FOOTPAD AT WORK.
- â
A Citizen Struck on the Head and
Robbed While Going Home.
G. A. Williams, a helper in the shot
tower, who resides at 23 Perry street,
visited police headquarters last night and
reported that he was violently struck on
the head last Saturday night at the cor
ner of Fourth and Harrison streets and
relieved of a gold watch.
Mr. Williams stated that he. had been
out shopping and was homeward bound
when the assault occurred. It was be
teween 10 and 12 o'clock when he reached
Harrison street. Without .warning a man
jumped out of a dark 'doorway and struck
him with a blunt instrument. The blow
badly dazed. Mr. Williams, and as he fell
on the sidewalk his watch was torn from
his pocket. Before he could give the
alarm the footpad escaped.
The victim showed the effects of the
blow dealt him. His eye was blackened
and his nose swollen/Other bruises were
concealed by the bandage he wore
around hie head. (

Defense Making Out
a Good Case.
HIS PHYSICAL CONDITION
MAJOR EDIE DECLARED HE HAD
TOO MUCH TO DO.
JJothing to Show He Had Ever Ap
plied Money He Received for
His Own Private
Purposes.
It Is beginning to look brighter for
Lieutenant Neall. Three witnesses have
testified, and there has been nothing said
that shows anything more than the ef
fects of overwork and sickness. The
prosecution has not finished, however,
ahd there may be stronger evidence In
reserve, but so far the defense ems to
be making out a good case on the two
graver charges, conduct unbecoming an
officer and a gentleman, and conduct
prejudicial to good order and military
discipline. /
The examination of Major Edie was
concluded during the morning session
of : the court. He said he believed the
state of health in which Neall was at
the time of his disappearance was due
.to his failure to fpllow the directions
given to him to go to bed and stop work
ing. When Edie had given this advice
Neall said he had too much to do, and
he would be all right in a few days, any
way. Edie had told him it was a very
serious matter, and he would not be all
right unles he took a rest.
The questions of the judge advocate
then turned on the statement of the wit
ness made the day before, to the effect
that Neall was keeping his strength by
the use of alcoholic stimulants. He
asked the witness .what he meant by
that statement. Edie replied that
Neall's appetite was gone, his food did
him no good,_ and it was necessary that
he take some stimulant to keep up his
strength.
"Was it by your direction he took
these stimulants?" asked the judge ad
vocate.
"It was not," said the witness.
"Would the omission of any part of his
many duties have any effect upon the
abnormal state of his health?"
"lt would exaggerate lt."
"Looking back, would you modify your
opinion as to the condition of his health
ln February last?"
"I should say his ill health was great
ly aggravated." '_J
'Were his many duties beyond his phy- j
sical or mental strength?"
"Ceertainly they were. He should not '
have been doing anything."
Captain Danes then asked if these:
stimulants Neall took would not partly
account for his inability to attend to his ,
duties. "1 never saw him too much un
der the influence of liquor to attend to
his duties," answered the witness. "I
know he was not .'ting, and he had to '
keep his strength up with alcohol."
'iijat ended the examination of Major
L_ie. and he gave place to Major Field, I
Second Artillery, inspector of artillery :
and Inspector general of the Department !
of California. Major Field told how he
had Inspected the accounts of the post
exchange, but he had not been able to
make a complete inspection owing to the i
absence of Lieutenant Neall. When he \
first ordered' Neall to prepare for the in
spection he was asked to postpone It for
a time, as Neall -said he was then set
tling with the Eighth California Volun
teers. On February 15, however, be was
at the Presidio on other duty and he told ,
Neall he would inspect the exchange
that afternoon at - o'clock. Neall said
he would be ready, and Field went on
with his other duties. He went to the
exchange at half-past 2 and found Neall
was not there. He asked for an orderly
from the adjutant, and the orderly
hunted for the missing officer all over
the post, hut he could not be found.
Under cross-examination it was at
tempted to show that Neall had consid
ered that the time of 2 o'clock was con
ditional upon the duties the inspector had j
to perform, and that perhaps Neall be
lieved the inspector could not be there on {
time, but Field said he waited during
the whole afternoon and still Neall re- i
mained away. He said that he did not I
consider a wait of half an hour any
thing out of the way, but he thought for
the officer to remain away the whole af
ternoon was a circumstance that cer
tainly required explanation. He knew
Neall as a punctual and conscientious
soldier, and when he did not appear was
the first time he suspected something ,
was wrong. He was afraid then the ac
counts were not all right.
Lieutenant F. W. Harris, adjutant of
the post, was the next witness. He told j
how on the noon of the day Neall dis
appeared he received and receipted for !
his order to duty as officer of the day for
February 16, a matter that Mr. Thornton |
announced he did not contest, although j
the accused had pleaded guilty.
Continuing, Harris told now Mrs. Neall
had come to him and told him her hus
band had disappeared and she was left
destitute. He told also of the action of
the officers at the club" who raised money
for her. He said he had not received the
dividends from the exchange which
should have come to him for the use of
the regimental fund and the band, and
he had spoken to Neall about it, but had
received no satisfaction from him. He
told the adjutant he could not make any
return until he had had indorsed by Mrs.
Nolan, as administratrix of the estate
of her husband, who had been Neall's
predecessor In charge of the post ex
change, certain check made payable to i
Lieutenant Nolan. Harris referred the
matter to the commanding officer, Col
onel Compton, but here Thornton put in â 
his first objection of the trial. He ob
jected to have the witness tell what
Compton had said to Neall. as it was
iearsay, and the Judge advocate wlth
rew the question until Colonel Compton
could testify himself.
Harris then said he had received from'
Major Edie. who had got them from Mrs.
NealL a bundle of checks relating to ex- !
change business, and these he had turned
over to the exchange officer. Lieutenant
Slavens. He looked over the checks be
fore he turned them over and he saw
that some were made to the "officer of
the post exchange," some to Lieutenant
Nolan and others to Lieutenant Neall. !
He was sure none of them had been in- i
dorsed by Mrs. Nolan.
He was also questioned about a hill to i
the Presidio Club, presented to Captain
Lock wood, which had not been paid, al- ,
though there was a check from Captain
Lockwood turned over to Neall for that
purpose.
Under cross-examination it was shown!
that the bill was not a very old one and j
the check was also of somewhat recent'
date. Further cross-examination showed
that it was on January 25 that Neall
spoke to the adjutant about the checks

jj Yet there are some inhabitants of that locality who kept the party under close surveillance all the time they â¼
a were in the neighborhood, who laugh at 400 fish, and these inhabitants are men whose word is their bond. There are
28 those in this city who know the sextet intimately who are willing to. stake their last dollar that the only thing caught by j ?
â¦ the ertire crowd was "such a headache!" Â£
â J There are several matters in connection with that expedition that require a more lucid explanation than has Â«
gj been given yet, but which will all come out in time if the participants are permitted to babble on, and careful note
a is taken of all their statements. . .': . lt __.*Â« Â«,Â«,* _, t
Â« For instance, there is much curiosity to know how such a crowd could start oft on the trip with a bottle and a -.
*T half of bait and return with two full bottles. Yet that Is what they tell. and. moreover, they resent any show of in
â¦ credulity. Now. if they would admit to two full men people would think they were beginning to get down to some
*? thing like facts, but for them to talk about bringing back anything at ail in the bottles or that they started with *>
, only a battle and a half, why, it's absurd on the face of it. . _,
? ' Then* there are certain parties who would like to hear an unbiased version of Gallwey s experience on a log. The *3
Â£ doctor himself admits that he went out on the log to fish and that it gave way with him dumping him into the clear. *
? cold mountain stream. But the Way he tells it leaves the impression" that there is much interesting data that is with- 85
Â£ held. Whether he went to sleep on the log and rolled into the creek, or attempted to ride it and the pesky thing
â¦ bucked, are details yet to be learned. -*-â .>_ -.- â -.- " "'â¢'._â¢' _ __ _ _ â , â¦

â¦ Perhaps the failure of the San Mateo people to have an account of the affair sent up is because of the shameful â¦
88 abuse of a horse by the alleged fishermen. The poor .beast was harnessed to a three-seated carryall, and hauled them Â»

that had to be indorsed, and that Mrs.
Nolan had been appointed administratrix
only the day before.
The whole character of the testimony
goes to show that while Neall did not
keep his books written up. from what
ever cause, he had all the money he re
ceived In a place of safety, and that he
had never misappropriated any of it. His
statement that he was waiting for Mrs.
Nolan to indorse the checks will be ac
counted for by the fact that she was ap
pointed administratrix only the day be
fore he made the statement, and, she
could not have Indorsed the checks be
fore that time. As to his absence, he will
have to depend on medical testimony to
free himself of that charge.
The case is summed up In a question
put by Mr. Thornton to Lieutenant Har
ris- "Have you any knowledge that these
checks (those of the exchange) had ever
been used by Mr. Neall for his. private
interest?;' asked Thorton.
"No, I have no such knowledge, was
the answer.

Monday reported to the police that a
well-dressed man had called upon him
and endeavored to sell him some tickets
for a picnic which, he claimed, was to be
given by the American Association on
May 4 at Shell Mound Park. Thinking
the man was a fraud he refused to have
anything to do with him.
Subsequently the man met Rev. Father
Nugent of St. Brigid's Church and also
endeavored to victimize him. Father Nu
gent has informed the police that no
such picnic is to be held and says that
the man Is a fraud, .It is claimed that
the schemer represents himself as a Dep

the tickets for the alleged picnic is to
raise sufficient money to furnish a libra

UNIVERSITY REGENTS
â¢ THANK TWO STUDENTS
SUMMER SCHOOL EXTENSION
MAY BE CURTAILED.
Two students of the University of Cali
fornia, J. W. Craig and E. H. Denicke,
were tendered the thanks of the Regents
yesterday for their work last Thursday
in preventing the destruction by fire of
the Mining 'building at Berkeley. Their
presence of mind and prompt action, it
was acknowledged, had prevented an ex
tensive conflagration.
At the same meeting the Regents ap
pointed President Kellogg emeritus pro
fessor of Latin, the appointment to date
from July 1 next.
Charles M. Bakewell, a graduate of the
university, now at Bryn Mawr, Pa., col
lege, was appointed assistant professor
of philosophy, the appointment to take
effect July 1, 1900. H. E. Montague was
appointed Instructor ln philosophy to act
during the absence of Professor Howi
son.
The principal business of the remainder
of the session was In connection with the
proposed extension of the summer school
at Berkeley. â¢ President Kellogg stated
that the proposition to enlarge the course
so as to take pedagogy, mathematics
and history, in addition to physics and
chemistry, seemed to the faculty at the
university doomed to failure during the
coming summer by reason oLthe fact that
many of the teachers who wtuld be bene
fited by. such enlargement would be at
Los Angeles during the time of the sit
ting of the National Educational Asso
ciation. For that reason he asked that
the board rescind its order for the three
additional subjects. There was consider
able discussion on the matter, which. was
finally compromised,' on motion of Regent
Rodgers, by the appointment of a com
mittee of five to arrange for the addition
al course and formulate plans for the re
ception of such of the delegates to the
association as might be induced to go to
Berkeley. The chair appointed President
Kellogg and Regents Rodgers, Kirk,
Budd and Pardee.
The thanks of the Regents were ex
tended to Mrs. Phebe Hearst for a collec
tion of books on art and architecture
Rufus N. Grant 'was appointed master
carpenter of the Wllmerding School at a
salary of $1000 a year.
The Regents authorized the expenditure
of $1675 on the Johnson building on Sut
ter street, providing Nathan, Dohrmann
& Co., the lessees of one of the stores,
would make certain alterations. This
amount makes the investment of the
university In the Johnson building an
even $400,000. Y',*"'" â

who say it cured them of general debility, of wasting weakness; the men who have blcome strong and vigorous by following Dr. Sanden's ad-
vice, are the best evidence of the worth of his system. There are thousands of them. If you are weak Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt will cure you.
Et will make you strong; it will steady your nerves and check all waste of power in thirty days. It is a grand cure for all weakness, whatever
the cause. It costs little,' is worth all that life is, for it makes life worth living. If you are troubled with weakness in any way, send for this
Belt. Don't be ignorant of a remedy that will correct all your past mistakes and assure your future happiness. Don't delay; act now. Get the

Henrioulle's Tale of How the Light-
Fingered Rascal Relieved Him
of Two Purses of Gold
Seals His Doom.
We, the jury, find the defend
ant, John Piggott, guilty of
grand larceny as charged in
the indictment. J. B. Mulcahy,
foreman; Walter A. Janke, John
Garrity, E. H. Lange, Claus
i Bardenhagen, F. N. Martinotte,

| C. E. Darling, Walter Carter.
John Piggott, yho is regarded by the po
lice as one of the cleverest pickpocKets
in the country, but who has heretofore
defied the authorities to convict him, was
declared guilty of grand larceny by a jury
In Superior Judge Cook's court last night,
and will be sentenced Saturday. . The jury
was out about fifteen minutes.
Piggott was charged with picking the
pocket of Gregoire Henrioulle on a Mission
street car while returning from the Ingle
side racetrack on March 11 of this year.
Henrioulle had two purses in his pocket,
one containing $34 and the other $100 in
gold. When he started to leave the car
at the corner of Mission and Seventh
streets he felt a hand in his pocket. He
turned quickly and caught Piggott in the
act of withdrawing his hand. He grabbed
htm and accused him of robbing him.
Piggott denied the charge, but as he did
i so Henrioulle saw him passing something,
| presumably one of his purses, to Childs.
The victim of the pair promptly collared
the pickpocket's accomplice and held them
both until the arrival of an officer^
The purse containing the $34 was found
on the platform of the car at Childs'
feet. The other purse was not recovered,
but when searched at the City Prison five
$20 gold pieces were found in Plggott's
socks. The claim was made that the
clever thief had made away with the
purse and slipped the gold under his
â waistband, allowing them to drop into his
socks while being taken to prison.
The trial of the case was begun yester
day afternoon. Assistant District Attor
ney Black conducting the prosecution and
Attorney George D. Collins representing
the defendant. Henrioulle was the first
witness and told of the occurrence as re
lated above. His testimony was given in
a convincing manner, and cross-examina
tion failed to shake It.
H. H. Hutchins, who was on the car
when the trouble occurred, testified that
he saw Piggott drop something. Thomas
Connolly, the conductor of the car, Henry
Newman, a passenger, and Patrick J.
Parrell. the arresting officer, testified in
corroboration of the robbery and the sub
sequent finding of the purse at Childs'
] feet. Police Sergeant Martin and Detec
: tive Gibson testified to searching the pris
oner and finding the gold In his shoes,
and Detectives Silvey and Eagan testified
I as to his general reputation being bad. '
The defense sought to show that Pig
gott was in the habit of carrying his
; money in his shoes, and that it would
have been impossible for him to have
slipped the money into his socks while
being taken to the police station. Mrs.
Johanna Fredericks, Piggott's landlady,
. testified that she saw him place this par- ,
ticular $100 in his shoes before he left the
bouse on the noon of the day the 1
robbery occurred. There was also an en
deavor to, show that Piggott and Childs
were strangers, but this was successfully
: combatted by the testimony of Sergeant '
Martin and the detectives.
The defense contended that Piggott

could not have placed the money inside [
his stockings, and a dramatic scene was j
enacted in the courtroom when Piggott |
was placed on the stand to prove this
claim. He was handed five twenties and
the jury, court and spectators were
treated to the sight of Piggott dropping
twenties into his waistband, then dane- i
ing around until they fell out on the floor. |
Then Piggott placed the twenties under j
the waistband of his underclothes, hopped
around some more and pulled his trous
ers* legs over his knees to let whoever
would inspect.
An examination showed that the' twen- ;
ties were stopped by his garters. The I
garters were removed and the yellow
pieces were again stopped In their down- j
ward course by the prisoner's shoetops.
Piggott also gave the jury his version of i
the affair on the car. but his testimony j
apparently carried little weight.
The case was not concluded until 10:15 .
o'clock last evening. The jury was out
less than fifteen minutes and then re- ;
turned to have the testimony of Henrioulle
read to them again. They then repaired i
to the jury room but remained there only ;
long enough to sign their,, verdict. The
jury was. polled and all affirmed that they

GOVERNOR GAGE'S APPOINTMENTS.
IT is safe to say that if Governor Gage manipulates
the patronage within his control upon the lines
which have been laid down for him by some of his
admirers' and supporters he will dispose of the Repub
lican party in a manner at once summary and effec
tive, it is not necessary at this time to recapitulate
the appointments foreshadowed by the Governor's
"friends." He said in an interview at Los Angeles
the other day that it would be difficult for him to get
down to the "newspaper level" upon any proposition.
But if he adopts the course which. the Burns touts
have laid out for him with respect to patronage he will
descend far below the "newspaper level," if not reach
the level of the slums.
Among the things which the Governor is alleged
to have in contemplation is the removal of Health In
spector Dockery. It i- said that this official is to be
dismissed in order that a place may be made for an
Assemblyman named Devoto, a Sixth-street saloon
keeper, who supported. Dan Bums throughout the
late Senatorial contest.
Dockery is one of the few men who during recent
years have endeavored in this city to discharge their
full duty to the public. Under his direction. the pure
food department of the Health Board has become a
really useful bureau. He has scattered the food adul
terators to the four winds, and has practically com
pelled the milkmen of this city to supply their cus
tomers with pure milk. Several attempts have been
made heretofore to remove him, but in every case
they have come to grief, solely because his record as
an official was too strong to be overlooked. If Gov
ernor Gage shall now supplant him with the pro
prietor of a Sixth-street grogshop he will certainly
take a long step toward getting below the "news
paper level."
The Republican party is not, moreover, in a con
dition to stand much of this sort of business. It al
ready has what is known among politicians as a
"black eye" in connection with the Senatorship, and
the rank and file of the party will not stand the adop
tion of any such political course as Governor Gage's'
fticnds among the Burns machine have prepared for
him.
The Governor is under obligations to the people of
San Francisco for his position. If he forces upon
them a machine Registrar, a machine water-front ad
ministration, a machine Health Board, to say noth
ing of a machine Labor Commissioner, they will cer
tainly resent his conduct at the next election. The
distinction of being a stanch friend of Dan Burns
will be nothing to the distinction which history will
heap upon him as being the wrecker of the Repub
lican party.
THE DEf-ITTi OF TABOR:
WITH the passing of ex-Senator Tabor o^Colo
rado the West has lost one of its most unique
figures, the Centennial State its greatest bene
factor.
The story of Tabor's sudden accession to wealth
reads like a story from the Arabian Nights. A poor
storekeeper in the almost deserted town of Gro, he
"grubstaked" a poorer cobbler, ignorant of mining.
The luck of fools and tenderfcet is proverbial, and
August Rische proved no exception to the rule. He
struck the Little Pittsburg and made himself and
Tabor. Right there the strength of character of the
storekeeper showed. While Rische began at once
to see how much fun he could get for his money,
Tabor pressed his luck. He went in for "grub
stakes" and more mines and had more luck.
Everything he touched became money. The "old
man," as he was called, was immediately surrounded
by sycophants, who, every other means failing to turn
his head, tried to make him believe that a great po
litical future was in store for him. For a time they
made him believe it, but that time was short, being
only the thirty days he served as an appointed
Senator, which short term became famous only
through the story of a $250 nightshirt that never was.
Later he was gratified with election to the position of
Lieutenant Governor, but his failure in that position
was so conspicuous, even to himself, that Tabor was
quite cured of political ambition.
While he may have been foolish politically, it. is
agreed on all sides that he was not ungrateful to the
State of Colorado for the riches he had taken from her
hills. As best he could and as quickly he sought to
repay. An opera-house in Denver which to this
day is a model for its kind, was one of his first works.
Numerous other buildings in the city, the pioneers in
modern architecture in the West, were erected at his
will. He was the head and front, with purse and in
fluence, in every, public movement as long as his
money lasted. He was a poor manager, and the end
came five years ago. Then he was forgotten until re
cently President McKinley, finding him in poverty,
making a last struggle to regain the place he had
lost, appointed him postmaster at Denver.
How has Colorado remembered such a benefactor?
Has she named a town after him or a public park or
a schoolhouse, or even one little street? . Not that the
records show. The Centennial State had almost for
gotten Tabor until his death. Maybe she will place a
ton of marble on his chest and yet call him blessed.
THE SflMOflN SITUATION.
SAMOA has caused trouble and discussion in the
world out of proportion to its size and impor
tance. The natives are among the finest of the
Polynesian people, ranking with the Maories and
Kanakas in physical presence and power and in in
tellect,. The natural tropical productions of the
islands supplied their wants without labor, and instead
of the diseases of civilization keeping their population
within the bounds "of this natural food supply, the peo
ple accomplished the same end by restricting their
meat diet to the consumption of enemies killed or
captured in war.
Christian civilization found them out at last, and
by prompt introduction of the loathsome diseases,
which are among its gifts to aborigines everywhere,
put an end to cannibalism not only by reducing the
population through sickness, but also by making the
survivors non-edible.
After this part of the. white man's burden had been
assumed and the Samoan soul had been put in the way
of salvation, there arose a desire to occupy, possess
and own the Samoan's lands. During Grant's ad
ministration an ambitious American special Consul
taught our people pet names for the islands and was
sure the republic could not survive unless they were
annexed. However, manifest destiny was not as al
luring then as now, and the natives were left alone
tc the exterminating influences of the pestilences we
had bestowed upon them.
During Mr. Cleveland's first administration the
Samoan consulship was given to a San Franciscan,
who found it slow business watching copra dry in the
sun and brought on a fight between Mataafa and
Malietoa, rivals for the kingship. His description
of leading his king out and taking him by his shell
collar and gee string, while the German Consul did
the same by the king favored of Germany, and knock
ing the two royal persons together to get them to
fight, is one of the most amusing things in our con
sular history.
This Consul thereafter ran up the flag over the
royal palace in Apia and proclaimed an American
protectorate. But, as he neglected to "nail the flag"
to the island, it was hauled down and he was called
home.
During the Harrison administration this country
invited England and Germany to assist it in the super
national task of bestowing good government upon
Samoa, the difficulties being such that only the three
strongest nations in the world could meet them.
Ever since then Samoa has had probably the worst
government ever known. The rights of the natives
have been trampled under foot.- The foreign resi
dents have jangled and backbitten each other, and
the old cannibal days have seemed like a dream of
peace compared to the turmoil and tension resulting
fiom three little men governing an afflicted people for
three big nations.
Out of this partnership of folly may issue trouble
with Germany. It is claimed that England and the
United States have violated the treaty of Berlin, in
which the partnership of the three nations was ar
ranged. It is rather remarkable that England en
couraged Admiral Kautz to bombard the bamboo
shacks of the natives and disregard the protests of
the representative of Germany. But, though we may
have been pulling international chestnuts out of the
fire for Great Britain, we must go ahead and fight
our German partner if we have to. It is part of the
white man's burden. The entire Samoan group and
all that grows there is not worth enough to pay de
cent interest on the damage to American commerce
that would follow a declaration of war against Ger
many and would fall before a blow has been struck.
Yet we are now face to face with the possibility of
such a war, and it may be noticed that England is in
a position to stay at peace and let us fight it out, with
no more serious contribution to our welfare than her
highly valued and veteran "moral support."
THE TAXPAYERS' BURDEN.
MR. JOHN J. VALENTINE, the tax
shirker of the .We,lls-Fargo Express Com
pany, having arranged for shifting the white
man's burden of taxation from himself and his com
pany to the shoulders of the general public, has
turned his pious thoughts to the brown men of the
Orient and finds cause to mourn.
In an article about as long-winded as a hypocrite's
prayer he set forth his views of the conditions of the
Malay laborers in the tropics and succeeded in get
ting it passed through the press of an evening paper
by means unknown to the public. Possibly it was by
some trick of legerdemain, a mutual interchange of
pass and repass between the parties to the play but
that'is a minor matter. The main thing is: Mr. Val
entine desires the people should know that he is
weeping over the brown man's burden.
It appears from his article that Mr. Valentine is
sadly grieved because the "cowed and patient Malays,
working under the harsh supervision of agents, pro
duce wealth, that is rightfully theirs because earned by
them on lands which have been wrested and tricked
from them," only to see that wealth carried off by
foreigners. Such grief for such a cause is undoubt
edly philanthropical, but what does the weeping Mr.
Valentine think of Americans who produce wealth
only to see it tricked from them by the tax-shirking
corporation of which he is the most conspicuous or
nament?
The burden of taxation imposed upon the people
of the United States for the purpose of raising a war
revenue would not be onerous to any if all bore their
due shar,e of it, but when rich corporations shift their
share upon others the burden becomes heavy upon
those on whom it falls and is the more irritating be
cause the unwilling bearer knows it has been imposed
upon him by the tricks and frauds of unpatriotic
shirkers of public duty.
Again and again the courts have declared that the
tax imposed upon the business of express companies
by the war revenue act must be paid by the compa
nies, that it is the duty of their agents to affix the
revenue stamps the law requires. These declarations
have been made in many States and by many authori
ties. Still Mr. Valentine refuses to obey and fights
for time. Every day of delay gives him that much
longer in which to levy tribute upon the public, and
he avails himself of it to the utmost.
Clearly the white man', burden of taxation frets
Mr. Valentine only when he cannot shift it upon
some one else. When he can accomplish the shirking
he resumes his show of piety, prepares circulars full*
of scriptural injunctions for his employes at one
time and at another prepares articles on the wrong of
robbing the brown man and passes them along.
The brown man of the Orient need not be grateful
to his unexpected champion. Mr. Valentine mourns
for the lot of the Malay only because he has no share
in the spoils. If the fortunes of war and imperialism
bring the suffering laborers of the Orient under the
domination of the Wells-Fargo Company Mr. Valen
tine would skin them alive.
If Italy insists upon having a port in China it would
pay the Empress to call in old Menelek of Abyssinia
to act as arbitrator.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APEIL 12, 1899
PURCHASING SENATORSHIPS.
IT seems that so long as the purchase of United
States Senatorships was confined to respectable
politicians, distinguished soldiers and statesmen
and public spirited millionaires, the practice of putting
them up and knocking them down to the highest bid
der did not arouse much resentment among the peo
ple. But for some time a low, disreputable class of
boodlers have been emboldened by the example of
their betters to make bids. The deadlocks throughout
the country and the adjournments of Legislatures
without election are, it is affirmed by intelligent
authority, the result of attempts to secure the toga by
men entirely unworthy to aspire to it.
The cases of Addicks in Delaware, Quay in Penn
sylvania and Burns in California point the moral
which adorns this tale. Addicks is a Republican mil
lionaire politician, and for six years he has been try
ing to "bribe the Delaware Legislature to give him the
Senatorship. A few days before the late General As
sembly adjourned three Democrats, one Senator and
two Assemblymen, voted for Addicks. There is so
little question that they were paid to do so that all
the people of Delaware have assumed such to be the
fact. The president pro tern, of the Senate struck the
name of the Senator off all the committees to which
he had been appointed, and the Assemblymen were
ostracized by their colleagues, irrespective of party.
Everywhere the three men go they are pointed out as
boodlers and denounced as having sold themselves to
Addicks. There was some difficulty, in fact, at one
time in protecting them from the wrath of a mob
which had assembled about the Capitol to lynch
them.
In Pennsylvania Quay has held the Senatorship
for two terms, with the effect of arousing an opposi
tion in his own party which bids fair to defeat him.
Quay's methods are the methods of a practical, un
scrupulous politician. He is the type of men who
are everywhere dragging the Government down to
the level of the slums, and to whose efforts to achieve
power the historians of the American republic will
attribute the results which the historians of Rome at
tributed to the Praetorian guard.
Nothing need be said of the Burns campaign in
California. All its details are still familiar to our peo
ple. The important question is, however, how are the
aspirations of the corrupt politicians who are now
aspiring to the Federal Senate throughout the coun
try to be permanently thwarted? If this class of men
arc permitted to continue their purchases of Senator
ships, in the course of time the great historic upper
house of Congress will become nothing more or less
than a refuge for vulgar millionaires and political
boodlers. The degradation which presages' the de
cline of its influence has already begun to appear in
the contempt which all classes of people feel for some
of its members.
0N INTERESTING EXPERIMENT.
NO legislative act of the past winter has attracted
more general attention than that of the Legis
lature of Michigan authorizing the city of De
troit to acquire the ownership of street railroads
within municipal limits and operate them as public
works. The experiment is certainly to be watched
with more than ordinary interest by the people of
every city large enough to have a considerable street
railway system. . . . â¢
While the municipal operation of street railways is
common enough in Europe, it has never been at
tempted on any notable scale in this country. What
is to be undertaken at Detroit is therefore a radically
new departure in American municipal administration
and will afford something like an effective test of the
policy of governmental control of public utilities of
which we have heard so much in the way of theoreti
cal discussion in recent years.
The Michigan law provides that the negotiations
for the purchase of existing lines and the arrangement
of details for operating them shall be intrusted to a
commission of three persons, to be designated by the
City Council, and that body has chosen Governor
I'ingree and two associates friendly to the plan to
carry out the work. The commission has large powers,
lCis required to report to the Council the price it is
proposed to pay for the street railways, to make an
nual reports of receipts and expenditures, to hold
books and accounts open to inspection by local
legislative authority, and is forbidden to incur any
debts whatever in operating the roads, but otherwise
its action is untrammeled.
Virtually the commission is an independent body
charged with' the sole function of operating street
railways in the interests of the community. It must
file the annual reports stated, and its accounts must
be public, but it can act in freedom and of its own
initiative, being subject in no way to the Council or
the Mayor. It is not responsible to any one even
for the amount it pays for the roads, the Legislature
having authorized it to issue bonds of the city for the
amount required â a sum estimated variously from
$12,000,000 to $17,000,000.
The undertaking is in every respect a Pingree
measure. It remains to be seen with what success he
will be able to carry it- out. The sentiment in favor
of municipal control of all local public utilities is al
ready, strong in the country, and if the Detroit ex
periment prove successful, corporations monopolizing
such utilities in other cities will have to be more
careful of the rights of the public than they have been,
as otherwise they may be forced to give up the busi
ness.

THE GOVERNOR DENOUNCED
The Paso Robles Recprd.
The Governor's failure to sign the bill to reimburse Claus Spreckels
" for the amount of money he so readily advanced to assist in relief work
last fall has caused a shudder of disgust to his (former) constituents and
others alike. It is only necessary to broach the subject to call forth a
bitter denunciation of such a policy. When the thought of asking for
relief came to the. people the thought was where and how to get it.
The Legislature was not. in session and Governor Budd was power
less to render public aid, but he immediately set to work and found a
beneficent man, Claus Spreckels, who said he would advance the money
to aid the sufferers.
' "The glad. news soon spread and "God bless Claus Spreckels" went
up from the sufferers. Imagine their Indignation when informed that
the man occupying the exalted position as Governor of the State should
not only refuse to sign the bill appropriating the money advanced, but
should reply in a taunting manner to a communication sent him (this
Governor) regarding his disposition of the bill when the time limit for
making the bill a law had almost expired.
What manner of man is this "mysterious" Governor Gage to so treat
the people's benefactor? It is little wonder that expressions of bitter
indignation are frequent when the thought that the provider of those
precious bales of hay "has been thus treated by one occupying the ex
alted position as Governor of the State of California. Did many of these
people shout for Gage and vote for him during the campaign of a few
months ago? Yes, but not to be thus disappointed without the free ex
pression of their thoughts concerning such action. The people believed
they had elevated a man to the exalted position to which he aspired
who was too broad-minded to drag a charitable act into politics. But
lo! they are doomed to disappointment.
The bill has been lost by the pocket veto system. Claus Spreckels
will not miss the eleven or twelve thousand dollars, but the Governor
has shown his hand to the people of California!
NO CHANGE HAS

THE SEASONS
An Average Rainfall
Is Maintained.
THE PROBLEM OF IRRIGATION
SUBJECT IS DISCUSSED BEFORE
BOARD OF TRADE.
Pumping Plant System Finds Favor
. With Authorities Over Present
7" ithod of Taking Water
From Streams.
The climate of California has undergone
no change,' and is undergoing none. The
average rainfall, taking years in groups
and not singly, has shown no diminution
ln the past fifty years. This was the dic
tum laid down at a meeting of the State
Board of Trade yesterday by men who
have made a part of their life work the
study of conditions which have a bearing
on the farming industry of the State.
Their deduction is that the' potency of the
forces that are at work to produce rain
are the same now as in the past, and that
they will continue in effectiveness.
The discussion as to existing conditions
in California was opened by W. H. Mills.
From a recently compiled chart he showed
the rainfall for half a century, declaring
that it was not quantity, but distribution,
which had the most beneficent effect upon
field culture. It was best to have general
rain. It should, properly, be light in Octo
ber and heavy in November. There should
be none in December or January, and then
light rains Into May. According to sta
tistics, January 10 marks tin- middle of tho
season, the rainfall up to that time being
usually one-half that for the winter. Mr.
Mills dilated upon the benefits to be de
rived from irrigation as an adjunct to the
rainfall. On this he said:
Fruit raising, vine growing and small
farming in California will depend for
their success in a very great measure
J upon the artificial application of water.
These applications have proven prof
itable and will continue to be so under
favorable conditions without irriga
tion; but they are far more profitable
with it. Every orchardist and vlne
yardist ought also to be a gardener,
and, in order to diversify the products
of the land, irrigation must be resorted
to. Clover, berries, gardens, orchards .
and vineyards should be found on. the
same holdings and should occupy the
attention of the cultivator of the soil
in their various seasons. This diversity
would in a measure equalize the de
mand for labor throughout the year
and greatly improve the labor condi
tions. Irrigation will enable the or
chardlst and vlneyardist to supply his
table with poultry, eggs, milk, butter,'
vegetables and fruits, and thus confer
upon his holding its first and para
mount duty of affording him a com
plete subsistence. The problem of liv
ing having been solved,* the question
of profit would become more certain
and, happily, less important. The an
cient methods of irrigation will be su
perseded by modern and more econom
ic methods. This revolution will be
referable to the cheapening of mechan
ical power and the increased efficiency
of pumping machinery. Under the old
method a main canal carrying water
at an elevation to lay a certain district
under Irrigation was necessary. Its
construction and maintenance were
costly, while the application of water
to lateral ditches was also costly and
unsatisfactory. A gravity supply of
water can be passed over a surface
where the decline is constant. There
are no lands sufficiently level to make
more than 60 per cent of their surfaces
subject to irrigation from any point of
elevation in their vicinity.
Naphtha or gasoline engines have
furnished a very cheap power for
pumping, "-While improvements in
pumps have made their use far more
economic than the application of
water by more primitive and crude
method of ditches. Of course, the
water must be brought to a point from
which it may be pumped economically,
and this can be done In three ways
first, by a main canal, which Is tapped
only with the suction of pumps. Such
a canal would cost less and would be
more permanent in its construction,
because it would not be constructed
with reference to supplying water to
laterals. Second, by the use of the
channels of living streams. For the
most part the irrigable lands of Cali
fornia are accessible to streams. Third,
by the sinking of wells. Concerning
the latter, lt should be noted that an
Irrigated country soon fills with water,
and wells In such a country afford an
ample supply for such portions of land
holdings as need irrigation. The eco
nomic use of the pump is also greatly
reinforced by the facility with which
In modern times electrical power Is
transmitted at cheap rates. Some
practical experiments In pumping were
made in various parts of the State
during the drought season of 189 S. It
is stated, on seemingly reliable au
thority, that there are not far from
2000 irrigation pumps in operation in the
county of Santa Clara alone. For the
most part these are using wells, and
their use has proven beneficial and
economical.
Regarding the use, of irrigation sup
plemental to the rainfall In Santa Clara
! County, the following was volunteered*
; "Many of the orchards of twenty acre
have their own pumping plants. Some ten
acre orchards have a plant and sell water
also to neighbors. Most of the larger
plants are so arranged that they also
sell water to adjoining orchards, and by
this system, which Is now pretty' well
developed, owing to the drought of last
year, the principal orchard district of
Santa Clara County is pretty well pro
tected in the way of Irrigation."
I. H. Thomas of Vlsalia, Tulare County
> contributed to the discussion the follow
ing statement as to the advantages de
rived from irrigation by use of a pumping
plant By at em. He said:
There are many advantages to be
gained by the pumping plant system
over the system of taking water
from the streams, one of which is box
ing the water under your control at
the time you need it; another is that
the water is free of the various seeds
that spread over your land from chan
nel irrigation, thereby making the
expense less in keeping the land in
good condition for the growing crops.
me of the greatest advantages with
the orchardlst is a preventative in the
shape of a severe frost. The object
lessons of the past winter in this
seclton are indisputable. Where late
irrigation and winter irrigation was
followed with good cultivation the cit
rus and deciduous orchards stood the
temperature without damage, jg while
adjoining lands, which were dry and
uncultivated, were badly Injured at a
temperature of 22 to 28. With pumping
plant ready and the temperature at
the freezing point, by filling the
ditches through the night from wells
with water at 65 degrees, it would
raise the temperature several degrees
In the orchard and in many instances
save a fruit crop that would other
wise have been destroyed by the frost.
The difference between the tempera-'
ture of the water and the frost at the
killing point, 28 degrees, is about 37
degrees. Thus it will be seen that
the atmospheric temperature would be
raised sufficiently by the temperature
of the water to save the fruit.
In his advocacy of the pumping plant
system Mr. Mills expressed the belief that
San Joaquin Valley would not be hab
itable if Irrigated by the old system
throughout its length and breadth. He
said extensive Irrigation by ditches means
a swamp district in which is found ther
mal fever and malaria.
Irrigation, he said, fertilizes the soil
and at the same time equalizes the ter
n! perature. It gives to the land plant food
when water is pumped out of a river
where it has kccumulated. In this way
the land never deteriorates, but is en
riched
Colonel John P. Irish told of the im
portance which drainage had attained at
Fresno. From long continued irrigation
the land is full of water and is commen
cing to fill the low places. This water, he
thought, should be drained off, to be used
again. He called upon Arthur Briggs of
Fresno for his views. ,
Mr. Briggs first controverted the state
ment made by -Mr. Mills that a series of
irrigation ditches would produce disease.
He said irrigation and drainage
hand in hand. On the east side of Fresno
County the old irrigation ditches of ten
years * ago are being used to draw off
the water. He believed small pumping
plants could be introduced which would
pump water from the- ditches cheaper
and tetter than by running It off through
laterals. Water should not be used more
than once, as it develops alkali in too
large quantities. To prevent this it
should be carried away through the earth
to be saturated again with fertilizing ma
terial. il is people irrigate one year in
advance to aid nature and to provide
against a possible drought. Early irri
gation with cold water checks growth, as
it chills plants and trees.

ing system would be tried.

-1 pany, one of the largest oil producing
â¢ firms of Pennsylvania, are registered at
the Palace from Pittsburg.
They have not come out to California
. on a pleasure trip, but as a matter of
j good solid business, which, if it is con
: summated, opens up a brilliant future
for this State's budding industry..
The primary attraction that has
brought them here is the oil wells in the
Fresno and Santa Barbara regions. The
development work done in those sections
the last year has opened up hundreds
of good producing wells, but it has not
opened up a profitable market for the
crude product. Nearly all of it must be
shipped East for refining, and the long
haul plays havoc with the margin. It
| is the intention of the Emerya to estab
i lish one refinery, and possibly more, in
| the southern fields for the purpose of
j refining the oil here and extracting its
! by-products to meet the rapidly grow
: ing demand. California ofls refined here
I ln the State would in a short time con
trol the Asiatic and Hawaiian markets,
as there would be no heavy transconti
nental frieght chargeable against them,
and they could be sold at a less price
j than the products of Eastern refineries.
If the Emery people carry out their
plan it is their intention to "ay particu
lar attention to the extraction of gaso
line.
"There is a marvelous demand grow
ing in the Hawaiian Islands," said Mr.
Mallory yesterday, "for American oils
and particularly for gasoline. There are
big pumping stations on nearly all of
the sugar plantations and gasoline en
gines are generally used. '. . . ' :
"The Anglicizing of the Orient is al
ready having its effect on our business.
The demand for coal oils, so called, and
all of the by-products of petroleum, is
increasing rapidly. To make the largest
margin of profit from trans-Pacific trade
we must establish ' refineries in this
State, which nature has generously en
dowed with a very high grade of oil.
There Is no reason why California should
not control the Asiatic market as well as
that of Hawaii. I do not care to go into
our move fully until we have made a
j tour of the southern fields and see what
are the conditions that we must meet."

The transport Morgan City arrived'
from Manila yesterday after a good pas
sage of twenty-eight days. Strange to
say. tho Irat assistant engineer was in
disgrace, thus making the third consec
utive sport to come in here with
trouble in the engine room.
First Assistant Mears of the Scandia
was under arrest when hat vessel
reach..d port, First Assistant Dyer of
the Arizona was left behind at Manila to
serve a -lays' sent. for mutiny, and
now First Assistant Green of the Morgan
City is In disgrace
The relation: between Chief Engineei
Kelly and First Assistant Green were
strained before the Morgan City left
Manila. When that vessel ached Na
gasaki there was an open rupture, with
the result that Green was relieved from
duty and ordered to his room. Then the
firemen came into the squabble. They
aserted that the food supplied to them
was not good, *and that Green -ot into
trouble with the chief because* he stood
up for their rights. They therefore sided
with the first assistant and fused duty.
Then there was music in the air. Cap
tain Dillon explained to the men that it
was mutiny on the high seas, and told
them plainly what they might expect on
arriving at San Francisco. hen better
counsels prevailed and the firemen went
back to work.
The trouble wns not over, however, .
and one of the firemen is now nursing
v broken head as the result of an en
counter with Captain Dillon. Gus Moore
was one of the ringleaders of the strike,
and on a number of occasions the cap
tain had to admonish him. A couple of
days ago Moure was very insolent and
Captain Dillon ordered him below. The
tinman got furious and jumping for
ward struck the captain on the point
of the Jaw, felling him to the deck. Dil
lon was senseless for a few moments,
but when he got on bis feet again he
was not slow to act. Seizing an old
Mauser rifie, thai was lying on the
deck, by the barrel he used the butt as
v club and knocked Moore down. The
latter's scalp was cut open and he was
badly used up. â¢id ay when the
Morgan City docked his head was cov
ered with bandages and he was sick and
sore all over.
( if course there is going to be an in
vestigation. Green has complaints to
file not only against the chief engineer
but also against the captain. He ac
cuses the latter of conduct unbecoming
an oifieer of a transport and a gentle
man, but Captain Dillon laughs at the
charges and shows a letter from First
Lieutenant Thomas M. Moody, Twen
tieth Infantry, in charge of the men,
who went to Manila on thi Morgan City,
which thanks Captain Dillon for his
kindness and courtesy to everybody
aboard the transport during the voyage.
There ems to have been a series of
misunderstandings on and about the
Morgan City, lt was generally under
stood that she was to bring the remains
of 450 soldiers here for interment. In
stead of that she only brought the bod
ies of Lieutenants D. D. Alford, James
Mitchell and Ed A. Hailing. In army
circles the remains of the heroic sol
diers were also expected, and when the
Morgan City* passed Alcatraz the fort
began firing the minute guns. Captain
Dillon says it was generally supposed
at Manila that the bodies would be sent
up on the transport, but the order was
countermanded.
Seven discharged soldiers came up on
the Morgan City in charge of Captain
Christy of the Twentieth Kansas. They t
are: Edward Franklin of the Hospital
Corps, Sergeant E. O. Augestine, Private 1
John Short. Private John Clements and :
Sergeant Charles Peare of the Eighteenth i
Infantry, Private John Loftus of the
Twenty-third Infantry and E. A, Ander- !
son of the First North Dakota*.
The Morgan City will be overhauled and ;
rcprovisioned and got ready for a return i
trip to Manila as quickly as possible. She
is sure to be ready by the 2"th inst., but
If lt can be managed she will sail this
day week.

of three lieutenants. Eight discharged soldiers also came up on the vessel.

AVERT pretty wedding was celebrated in St. Stephen's. Church last
evening. The contracting parties were George E. Bennett of the
firm of C. W. Haseltine & Co. and Miss Susie F. Hall, and the cere
mony was performed by the Rev. E. J. Lion.
A bevy of young ladies under the direction of Mrs. J. M. Hall had
been engaged all day in decorating the Interior of the church, and
the sacred edifice was a veritable bower when the bridal party entered the
building.
Miss Hall was attended by Miss Edith H. Booker as maid of honor and

DISPUTE AS TO THE OWNERSHIP
OF TWO RACE HORSES.

Testify as to Admissions Made
by the Defendant.
The preliminary examination of Fred
Foster, the horseman, charged with ob
taining money by false pretenses by A.
Howard, the Australian plunger, was con
tinued before Judge Conlan yesterday.
C. P. Waterhouse, of the firm of Burns
& Waterhouse, testified to Foster having
purchased the horse Yellow Tail from his
firm for $10,000 and that Howard's name
cut no figure in the transaction. He knew
Foster only.
Charles A. Thorpe, Sl9 Guerrero street,
testified that he had no recollection of
having a conversation with Foster about
the purchase of Yellow Tail. The prose
cution places considerable importance up
on this statement of Thorpe, which will
develop before the case is through.
Edward K. Moffitt, 309 Howard street,
testified that Foster told him he felt the
losses on Howard's horse Yellow Tail
more keenly than Howard because he
had stood sponsor for the horse when

THE FIGHT FOR DECENCY.
John Carroll, Proprietor or Phono
. graph Parlors, on Trial.
John Carroll, proprietor of a phono
graph parlor at 724 Market street, ap
peared before acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday morning to answer a charge of
having indecent pictures in his possession.
Policemen Tyrrell and Esola, who made
the arrest, testified to having viewed the
pictures in Carroll'- parlors, and produced
a number which they had seized, which
the Judge examined.
* Carroll had no defense to offer except
that he would leave it to the Judge to
say whether the pictures could honestly
be called indecent. The Judge said he
would give his decision to-morrow.
Wolf's Bondsmen Sued.
Suits were filed yesterday in- the Su
perior Court by the heirs of the late
Sarah Maria Pearson against the sure
ties on the bond of John Wolf, executor
of decedent's estate, who disappeared
mysteriously from this city some time ago

are H. W. Wreden, William G. Wreden,
William Blester, Edward Lundstadt, John
W. Morsehead, David B. Faktor, G. H.
Walker and August Petzold. Sarah Ma
ria Robson and Mrs. Allison, daughters
of the deceased, instigated the present
suit and ask that they be given judgment
against the sureties for the sum of
$1120 40 each, such being, it is set forth,
their share of Wolf's shortage, which
amounts to $9237 32.
OUR SOLDIERS
in the PHILIPPINES
YOU are proud of the fine fighting spirit shown by
our Regulars and Volunteers in and around Manila
in the last month. It is something to hear and read
of it; it is far more to see, by means of photographs, the
charging troops, the men on firing line, the batteries in
action, the trenches, and the battle-fields with the Amer-
ican and Filipino dead x as they fell. HARPER'S

MONEY SEEKING INVESTMENT
BUSINESS MEN AND CAPITAL
ISTS CONFIDENT.
Big Blocks Change Hands in the
Wholesale District Involving
â¢ Large Sums, and Others
Being Negotiated.
San Francisco capitalists and business
men are showing their confidence in the
future of th. city in a manner that ad
mits of no criticism and which is ample
evidence that this city is entering upon
an era of prosperity greater than it has
experienced for years. They are putting
their surplus capital in real estate and
they are putting it out in large sums, as
the records afford undeniable proof. The
real estate transactions for the month of
March foot up to a total of over. $1,500,000,
and the record for the present month
promises to be double that -.mount. In
the first week in April transfers of real
estate amounted to $587,500, and a num
ber of deals that are now under way
with every prospect of being consum
mated within the next ten days will swell
this sum to nearly a million. 4V
Following are some of the larger deals
that have been closed since the month
opened:
North corner of Mission and Main streets,
$116,000; Nos. 3 and 5 Front street â¦.6,500; north
line of O'Farrell street, 197:6 went ot Powell,
$86,000; east line of Sansome street, 89 feet
south of California, $65,000; east line of San
some street, 118 (eel south of California, $58,000;
northwest corner of Van Ness avenue and Va
llejo street, $32,500; northwest corner of Eddy
and Larkin streets, $24,000; northwest corner of
Polk street and Fern avenue, m.500; east line
of Spear street, betweeri Howard and Folsom.
$20,000; west line of Ste\iart street, 275 feet
south of Market.'- $20,000; southeast corner of
O'Farrell and Powell streets, $60,000.
In addition to the above many transac
tions involving smaller amounts were re
corded of property transfers In the
Western Addition. Pacific Heights and
other outlying districts. A. M. Speck &
Co.t Bovee, Toy & Sonntag, Thomas Ma
gee & Son, Baldwin & Howell, Madison
& Burke, G. H. Umbsen & Co. and Easton
& Eldridge are the principal firms
through which the deals were engineered.
Money Is cheap and plentiful in San
Francisco just at this time and investors
are seeking for good property, large
blocks having the preference. There is a
well defined movement toward that sec
tion south of Market and east of First,
and the nearer the water front the prop
erty is located the easier It is to dispose
of it advantageously. Business men real
ize that .money invested in real estate
that can lie utilized for warehouses and
so located as to do away to a certain
extent with drayage charges will bring
in larger returns than almost any other
vestment. The prospect of a third
transcontinental competing railroad is a
strong factor in this confident feeling,
and while there is a general upward
movement in real estate of all kinds the
big deals for some time to come will be
confined to what is included in the whole
sale district. B-Bj-BltMil.'l'-IB
Young Men's Catholic Union.
The members of Leo Assembly No. 4,
Y. M. C. 1., met at Leola Hall, corner
Tenth and Market streets, last Thursday
evening to celebrate their eleventh anni
versary. After short addresses, compli

The evening was passed in an enjoyable
manner, concluding with refreshments
and a sociable smoke.
High School Debate.
An interesting debate between the senior
and junior classes of the Humboldt Even
ing High School took place last evening.
The subject under discussion was: "Re
solved, that alliance should be established
between the United States and Great Brit
ain for their mutual protection and inter
ests." Bert Schlesinger, who acted as
judge, rendered a decision in favor of the
supporters of the negative side of the
question. The junior class was represent
ed by Herbert Arthur .and Thomas F. Duf
fy and the senior class was represented
by W. G. Mellish and J. C. Corbett.
Bonds Not Sufficient.
Bernard Ward, ex-financial secretary of '
the Marine Firemen's Union, who was
held to answer on two charges of felony
embezzlement by Judge Conlan on $9000
bonds, was ordered Into custody by the
Judge yesterday, as he did not consider
the bonds furnished by Ward sufficient.
Ward surrendered himself at the City
Prison. His attorney will apply for a writ
of habeas corpus to-day asking for his re
lease on the ground that Judge Conlan
had no right to order him into custody, as
he lost jurisdiction In the cases when
Ward was held to answer.
In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce have been granted
Margaret K. Smith from James Smith
on the ground of failure to provide; Julia
A. Schoen from A. V. Schoen on the
grounds of failure to privide, intemper

Ruptured 20 Years
Wonderful Cure of a Weil-Known
Citizen of Wisconsin.
R. M. Wilsie's Good Fortune in Over-
coming His Affliction.
It Is a piece of good fortune to relate the
fact that there Is a cure for rupture. Some
people contend that only a surgeon with a
knife and a needle can bind the broken place
MR. R. M. WILSIE, Brandon. Wis.
together, but the experience of R. M. Wllsie.
of Brandon, Wis., completely upsets this I
theory.
There is a doctor In Adams, N. V., who has i
discovered a marvelous system of treatment
that not only retains any kind of a rupture,
but also causes the muscles t.i grow together. I
Mr. Wllsie heard of it and gave it a test. The I
results were astonishing..
Although 61 years of age and badly ruptured j
for more than twenty years, Mr. Wllsie begun i
to mend at once and was perfectly cured In a '
remarkably short time. To-day he is hale and
hearty, a tine looking gentleman and complete-
ly restored from the slightest trace of rup-
ture. He naturally recommends the system |
highly. His cure excited considerable interest
among his neighbors, many of whom were also
ruptured and who have since been cured.
The system of cure is the discovery of Dr. j
W. S. Rice, one of the best known rupture j
specialists in the country. He has recently is-
sued an illustrated book on the subject of rup-'
ture and sends it free to every one; his object
being to disabuse the public mind that rup- j
ture cannot be cured. The beauty of his sys- .
tern Is the absence of all pain: absolute im- i
munity from danger; no operation of any kind; j
and not the loss of a minute's time from work.
This is a subject well worth inquiring into.
Thousands of people have friends who are rup-
tured and they will do them a life-long service
to tell them of this new and marvelous home
cure. Send for the book. It is free to all. It
fully explains the system of cure and is im-
mensely valuable to all who are ruptured.
Write at once to Dr. W. S. Rice, 41S L. Main
street, Adams, N. Y.

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says:
"Recent information confirms what has j
been previously stated in this column re- ;
garding the rasin situation on the coast, j
and also points out that supplies of graded .
loose muscatels are greatly reduced, and
are held much suffer in consequence. Hold
ings la this market are relatively small,
and are held very firm at about previous
prices. The principal change is noted ln the |
Indisposition to shade prices to secure business, i
The association is not likely to make another
advance on this crop, but individual holders j
may conclude to mark prices up a fraction j
as spot stocks clean up.
"â¢Currants are firmer on recent advices from :
Greece, which report the first hands market ,
as much stronger on reports of crop damage,
which are not understood here. Some 5000
tons are now on passage from Greece to Eng
land and Germany, reducing available stock- i
in Greece to 18,000 tons. Spot demand is
larger, and prices are a trifle firmer. Hold
ers refuse to sell, present prices net them so
much loss, and all are taking as much ad
vantage as possible of the change in the Greek
market. , â¢ -: â .'"-:_'â¢_
"Prunes are unchanged. There is said to
be an attempt in progress to secure control of
all available supplies here and on the coast.
It is uncertain how large the purchases
would have to be to do that, but it appears
from what can be learned tliat "It wouldn't j
require a large sum of money to do it.
The difficulty purchasers meet is the firmer j
feeling which prevails and the indisposition j
of holders to let their stocks go. even when
full prices are offered for the entire supply,
Prices are reported as likely to advance
shortly on all larger and some medium sizes.
The conditions governing th" market are i
especially favorable to holders, and Indicate
a satisfactory situation during the remainder
of the season." "

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April ILâ Bullish confidence
prevailed in Influencing stock prices to-day,
which advanced almost continuously, slight set
backs regularly bringing new buyers. The
final dealings were In large volume, bringing
the total to nearly three-quarters of a million
chares. There was continuous support by large
operators, accompanied by optimistic utter
ances. Potent allies of higher prices were the
showing of the Government crop report in win
ter wheat, which was better than expected,
spring weather in the West, abundance of
money at easier rates and Washington advices
that a sudden call on the depository banks for
the funds to pay the Spanish indemnity was ]
not contemplated, but that the withdrawal of
Government funds would be gradual as hith
erto. A sentimental influence was the knowl- !
edge that a Presidential proclamation that we â¢
are at peace with Spain would be issued to- j
day. The grangers were liberally purchased
for Western account. The Vanderbilt Issues
continued ln active request. Local transporta
tion lines continued Btrong, Brooklyn Rapid '
Transit making an extreme gain of almost 9
points. The other Flower specialties were like
wise heavily purchased, People's Gae moving
up over 4 points. Continental Tobacco's rise 'â 
of 6% was in part associated with to-day's
meeting relative to a new stock issue. The
Southwestern group was active and strong, as
were the iron and steel shares. In fact before
the day was ended practically everything was
higher, the larger gains being among the spe
cialties. Commission house purchases increased
with the strength of the market. London was
but a small factor, selling about half as much
as It purchased. Call money began with large
loans at 6 per cent and gradually easing off
to iiÂ®3 per cent. The ease of money was re
flected In an appearance of more stcength in
the sterling exchange market, part of which
was possibly due to anticipatory purchases in
connection with the payment of the Spanish
Indemnity. Several foreign exchange authori
ties claimed to have noted no such buying
hitherto, which lead, to the belief that the
settlement was yet to be arranged. The mar
ket close, strong at about the best prices.
The bond market followed stocks but to only
a narrow extent. Total sales, $3,035,000.
United States old 4a and coupons advanced '
% in the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 72L905

The markets here were idle to-day on talk of
dearer money. The close was firmer. Ameri

York buying. The features were New York
Central, Atchison preferred. Union Pacific and
Reading firsts. The contango was 4%Â®4%, on
St. Paul It was %, Anacondas 8%, Bostons 2%.
New York is still buying Juniors of Mexican

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April, 11.â The Impulse among
wheat speculators at the start was to sell
on the Government crop report, which was
regarded as bearish. May opened %c lower
at 71% c down to 70% c, and as there was no
great amount of wheat wanted to begin with
the price declined steadily .to 70% c. The de
cline was accentuated by a report from Kansas
City to the effect that the Kansas crop had
without doubt Improved wonderfully |in the
last few days. The more the Government re
port was considered 'and analyzed the more the
trade was Inclined to doubt if it could right
fully be given a bearish interpretation, and
many of the early sellers wanted back former
holdings. May wheat rose from around 70% c
to 71% c. In the end the market began to yield
to the little peeping note of Improving pros
pects in Kansas and to turn a deaf ear to the
perfect howl of distress from* other quarters.
Liquidation set ln on a heavy scale and the
market lost the advance about as fast as It
gained it. May closed with sellers at 71V4^j
71% c, a net gain of %c.
The corn market kept In touch with wheat.
There waa a fair cash demand. May closed
unchanged. .
I o*ts were fairly active,' with trade of a gen-
I eral character. May closed %c higher.
I Liquidation weakened provisions. Cash trade
1 showed some little Improvement, but the stocks
1 of lard are accumulating fast and bulls in this
I product were discouraged because the May and
j June run of hoes is now here. Pork lost 15c,
' lard 7%c and ribs To.

There is no change in citrus fruits, the mar
ket being freely stocked with all kinds.
This bids fair to be a flne fruit year. Stocks
of canned and dried fruit have run down to
almost nothing, and owing to the shortage In
the Eastern crop the canners and driers are
making preparations to handle more than the
I usual quantity. The crop bids fair to be spot
ted, as the latest advices report more or less
of a drop almost everywhere. There will prob
ably be plenty of fruit, though the crop will
I hardly be enormous, as many have thought
up to the present.

HIDES. TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
Quotations for new Spring clip of Wool are
now given. The market remains very dull.
There is nothing new in Hops.
Hides are quiet and prices are considered too
high in comparison with Leather. The circu
lar of W. B. Sumner & Co. says:
"The hide business remains about the same
as last quoted. Prices continue at liberal fig
ures and sales are fairly active of certain
grades of hides and there id little or no sur
plus stock ln the market. Harness and Skirt
ing Leather has been quite active during the
past season and the better grade of hides com
mand liberal values. We are Inclined to think
that the present figures on hides will continue
for some time at least. For the local market
we quote: Wet salted heavy steers are In de
mand for harness and skirting; wet salted me
dium and light steers are fairly active; wet
salted cows sell readily; wet salted veal, kip
and calf are active and rule at full rates.
"Owing to the dry seasons which have pre
vailed in California during the past year the
tallow output has fallen off ana the stocks
on hand at the present time are very small.
Tallow has advanced about 1 cent per pound
since March 1, and the supplies at present
received are hardly sufficient for the de
mands of trade. We look for an active tal
low market."

There was a fair business In local securities
yesterday morning. The, Increased gas rates
gave Gas and Electric more tone, and there was
some recovery in prices, though not so much
as might have been expected. Sales were made

what higher at $91 50. Other stocks remained
about the same.
On the afternoon call business was quiet. Gas
and Electric stock weakened off to $74 87%.
Mining stocks were stronger, though business
continued quiet. The telegram from the pump
said: "Elevator working steadily, keeping the
water below 1850-foot level. The water in the
winze from the 1750-foot level Is IS feet 5 Inches
below the station.'"
At the bond session of the San Francisco
Stock Exchange 25 Hawaiian Commercial sold
at $91. 10 Sun Francisco Gas and Electric at

The report of General Manager Ross of the
Comstock Pumping" Association for the past
week reads as follows: "The pumping asso
ciation has been engaged in cleaning out and
repairing the C. and C. shaft below the 1760
--foot level. The shaft is in fair condition. The
pump compartment is nearly full of air pipes
columns, straps, pump rods and bobs, that are
difficult to take out. This compartment must
be cleaned out. as the space Is required for the
second elevator that will be placed ln this com
partment before the water can be lowered by
the first arranged elevator. The plan is to
place the second elevator in the pump compart
ment at as great a depth as possible; then to
start and hold the water at a point that will
allow us to break the Joints In the elevator that
Is now at work and raise it to the surface of
the water, when such changes as are required
can be made In the throat and nozzle, then to
lower it Into the water again and submerge it
as deep as possible.
"When the water has been lowered the pump
compartment will be cleaned out to as great a
depth as possible and the elevator In this com
partment will be again lowered to the point
where the required changes can be made ln the
first elevator. In this way of working the 600
feet of flooded levels will be drained. Judg
ing from our experience in draining the shaft
for 160 feet below the Sutro drain boxes, it has
been found that if an elevator was designed
for the full lift of 600 fee/ and it could be sub
merged below that point it would drain the
C. and C. shaft for that distance In from three
to four weeks: but It would not be safe to at
tempt such work. The water Is being drained
from the lower levels slowly, while being rap
idly lowered In the C. and C. shaft, as our
measurements taken at the Consolidated Cali
fornia and Virglna winze, the Hale & Norcross
incline and the Chollar combination shaft in
dicate.
"It Is quite possible that nearly all of the
drainage from the various mines finds its way
through the vein and not through the drifts
as our experience with Comstock drifts and
levels Indicates very clearly that there are but
few places where these openings will not cave
tight enough to form fairly strong dams.
"Since April 1 the water has gone down In
the Chollar combination shaft 5 feet 1 Inch. In
the Hale & Norcross incline 12 feet 6 inches and
in the 1750 winze 16 feet 9 inches, while being
lowered 120 feet In the C. and C. shaft. No
measurements were possible in the Osblston
shaft until April 6, when we found the water
to be 52 feet 11 inches below the station of the
drift connecting with the Sutro tunnel. The
water in the C. and C. shaft Is being kept down
to about its lowest mark, 132 feet below the
1760 level, by running the elevator* sixteen hours
during each twenty-four. We expect to con
tinue working in this way until the second ele
vator is in place. The pumping association has
been engaged as usual in doing work for the
several mining companies, as appears in their
weekly reports."

SEN. PERKINS
MAKES SOME
COMPARISONS
McKinley in Contrast With Gage
and Dan Burns as a Moral
Senator.
A Good Word for Hanna and HoarâDig
nified Method of Disciplining In
flated Senators.
OAKLAND, April 11.â For one hour
to-night Senator G. C. Perkins divulged
secrets, dropped significant remarks and
launched criticisms teeming with sugges
tiveness before a large and Influential au
dience in the First Congregational
Church. The address was perfect, not so
much for what the Senator said as for
what he inferred and said by indirection.
Senator Perkins took occasion to let his
audience know his opinion of Governor
Gage, Dan Burns, Senator Hanna and the
late Legislature and several other per
sons and things.
"Of course," said California's sole Sena
tor, "these are not criticismsâ
comparisons made in a social way. The
chairman has assured me ere are no
scribes here, so of course I feel free."
And then the speaker looked toward the
men with pencils and paper and pro
ceeded.
"I am not going to criticize," said Sen
ator Perkins, "but as I stand here I can
not help contrasting the methods of our
truly great President with that of the
Governor of California, of this great
State. Do you know that out of all the
bills introduced into the Senate President
McKinley vetoed just one and pocketed
another? What did we see at Sacra
mento recently? Hundreds of bills that
were passed by he Legislature are
tucked away in what must be one of the
most monstrous pockets m the State.
Surely the last Legislature must have
been %â¢ ry indecent or else* . Presi
dent McKinley is neither arrogant nor
has;;.. lie is truly treat. He says to
himself tnat if Congress in its wisdom
has been informed on measures, has de
bated them and has passed upon them it
Is but justâ not to .-ay courteousâ to be
lieve that its members are conscientious
and intelligent; it is but right that I
should sign them.
"When the President saw in the appro
priation bill a large item for educational
purposes he at once put his pen to it.
When our Governor saw a bill appro
priating a few thousand for our State
university he thought our great institu
tion should not have too much support
and the bill disappeared, In a similar
instance Governorâ now Presidentâ Me-
Kinley of Ohio showed such force and
sagacity that all America wanted him to
tase its scepter. 1 do not wish to criti
cize anybody here to-night, but a contrast
between two men may be interesting."
Senator Perkins did not propound the
query, "What would Dan Burns think of
the United States Senate and what would
the Senate think of Dan Burns?" but
the majority of his audience asked them
selves the question and heard the speaker
answer it.
"The religious complexion of the Senate
Is â I," said : Senator' Perkins- - "Nearly
all the members have some distinct reli
gious connection. I have never, in six
years, seen a United States Senator go
into a saloon. Neither have I seen one
ever do anything that they need be
ashamed of. They are, without exception,
men of sterling character, unimpeachable
morals and examples of statesmanship.
All attend church and all are sincerely
desirous of doing what is right and what
their constituents want.
"One of the most Impressive moments
in the Senate is the opening of a session.
Rev. Dr. Milburn has not seen the light
of day for thirty-five years and for half
of that time he has been chaplain of both
houses of Congress. As he is led into
the Senate by the Vice President every
Senator stands and as those sightless
yes are directed to heaven every one
feels an inspiration from his words. I
have heard him repeat that sentence in
the Lord's prayer, 'Lead us not into
temptation ,' so that it seemed like a
voice from God. And, believe me. it met
with a response from every one of those
ninety Senators, as they joined in the
solemn 'Amen.'
"I cannot forget that the California
Legislature at its last session did not de
cide upon a man to go to the United
States Senate, but if the choice had to be
made by the people at the ballot box
there would have been a Senator elected,
and 1 am In favor of amending the consti
tution so that this can be done."
Senator Hanna of Ohio, according to
Senator Perkins, has been grossly mis
represented by a' portion of the press.
After referring to the modern methods of
journalistic criticism, the speaker said:
"Senator Hanna is a much better man
than he is credited with being. Since his
boyhood he has been the architect of his
own fortune. He is a man of high char
acter, good standing in society and good
habits. He is a hard worker and Senator
Hanna has never to my knowledge cast a
vote in the Senate that will not stand the
Roentgen ray of investigation, no matter
from where directed. Don't credit all that
a partisan press says about United States
Senators, for all are good men, although
perhaps no more infallible than the Pope
of Rome.
"But though ail are good men, some are
th* reverse of practical. They do not
catch the spirit of things easily, and have
to be disciplined. There is a very digni
fied system in vogue In the Senate to
teach men their measure. It is by get
ting up and leaving a member talking to
empty seats and the galleries. One of
these is Tillman of South Carolina, who
Is said to have been thrown into the Sen
ate with a pitchfork. He is a good man
at heart, but cannot appreciate the fact
that the report of a committee is hardly
ever altered by argument on the floor.
However, Tillman talks and talks and the
gallery listens, and when the bell rings
for a vote the Senators file into their
seats.
"One day I asked who was speaking,
and was told it was Allen of Nebraska,
who was bellowing at some cattle on the
plains. On another occasion some one
asked who was talking, and the reply was
'Morgan of Alabama, who Is always talk
ing but never says anything.' Morgan is
a pleasant speaker, but he never changes
the sentiment of the Senate. He talks
too much.
"Senator Proctor was the man I once
asked if it was possible .to live economi
cally in Washington. I meant could a
man live on his salary of $5000. He re
plied "yes," that he was not economical,
but his wife was. and they lived in a
house for which they paid $8000 per year
re v nt ' That's economy in Washington,
where there are two classes of societyâ
Â°ne ytth appetites without dinner and
the others with dinners without appetites
âand that explains all.
"Senator Hoar has been abused by Call

I surprised the Senate by talking and vot

showed he had spent $8 75 to be elected to
, the United States Senate. Do you think
j you could beat that in California?" he
l said, laughing. And well he might laugh.
"That's easy," I replied. "I was elected
, while 3000 miles away on the first ballot,
, and all it cost me was $2 50 for sending a
dispatch to Sacramento thanking mv
friends."
Senator Perkins referred personally to
over a score of his confreres in the United
States Senate, and said that the office of
Senator means from six to sixteen hours
of work every day. Referring to the
breadth of the American character, he
said that in the Senate at its last session
I "there were twenty men" who had once
tried to destroy this GovernmentâConfed
j crate soldiers, and fifteen men who had
served in the Union army.
He closed with a forceful tribute to
President McKinley, and said: "When the
next two years of this administration
have closed I am confident that all will
acknowledge the Christianity, wisdom,
diplomacy and patriotism of our Presi
dent, who has this day proclaimed that
we are as a nation once again at peace
with Spain."
The address was given before the Young
Men's Congregational League.
! LITTLE ROSE YON SCHMIDT
NOT FORCED TO TESTIFY
Coroner's Jury Returns a Verdict of
Murder and Suicide in the Awful
Dual Tragedy.
ALAMEDA, April 11.â the'
jury, do find that the name of the de- I
ceased was Isabelle yon Schmidt, a
native of Australia, aged 32 years,
and that she came to her death at
2232 San Jose avenue at about
12:30 p. m.. April 9. 1899, and that
death was caused by a knife wound in j
the heart inflicted by Edward A. yon '
Schmidt with murderous intent. We,
the jury, do find that the name of j
the deceased was Edward A. yon j
Schmidt, a native of California, aged i
about 43 years, and that he came to j
his death at 2232 San Jose avenue at !
about 12:30 p. m., April 9, 1899, and !
that death was caused by a knife
wound in the heart inflicted with
suicidal intent.
Such were the verdicts rendered by the
Coroner's jury impaneled to investigate
the cause of death of Mr. and Mrs. E. A.
yon Schmidt, the principals In Sunday's
horrible tragedy. Before Coroner Mehr
mann commenced the Inquest he informed
the jury that although a murder had
been committed the murderer had placed
himself beyond the law by taking his own
life, consequently no testimony would be
introduced tending to show the motive
of the crime or the condition of the mur
derer's mind at the time of the killing.
No facts not already fully exploited in
the public prints were brought out.
Charles L. Tilden identified the remains
of Mrs. yon Schmidt and Deputy Coroner
Fowler gave similar testimony relative
to the remains of the dead woman's ex
husband. Mary Thompson, the nursegirl,
recited the story of the tragedy, and after
some other unimportant testimony the
jury returned the verdicts as given above.
The jury was composed of R. B. Decker,
W. G. Vollmar, A. Innes, C. W. Damon.
George X. Gray, R. H. Fallmar. R. M.
Mitchell and William W. Graham.
Little Rose yon Schmidt was not present
at the inquest. Coroner Mehrmann con
cluded that it would be cruel and in
human to force the little one to recite the
horrible details of Sunday's tragedy. The
funeral of Mrs. yon Schmidt will take
place to-morrow morning from the under
taking parlors of C. H. Wever, 1504 Park
street. All during the day the compan
ions and playmates of the Yon Schmidt
children have been carrying flowers to
decorate the casket containing the re
mains of the unfortunate mother.
FUN FOR COLORED TROOPS.
Visiting Soldiers to Be Entertained
by Local Admirers.
When the colored troops arrived from
the East recently and went Into quarters
at the Presidio their brothers and sisters
of color of this city and Oakland deter
mined to make their stay here as pleasant
an possible. To this end a special com
mittee of arrangements, consisting of
Major L. A. Penny and R. P. Keeling,
started the ball in motion. These gentle
men, with others, worked hard during the
late war with Spain to raise a regiment
to go to Cuba. to fight the Spanish, and if
hostilities had been prolonged they would
no doubt have been sent to the front.
Hence the selection in arranging for the
entertainment of the soldiers of â¢ the
Twenty-fourth United States Infantry.
The first in this line will be a banquet to
the visitors to be held this evening in
California Hall. 620 Bush street", under the
auspices of the Army and Navy Union.
A large number of invitations have been
sent. out to citizens and the affair prom
ises to be a success in every way..
The next feature in the way of enter
tainment will eclipse the banquet, because
of the greater possibilities. A moonlight
picnic, social and general good time will
be held in Germanla Gardens at Harbor
View on the evening of the 19th Inst. The
band of the Twenty-fourth Infantry will
be in attendance and any amount nf fun
may be expected. A general invitation
has, been extended to the residents across
the bay and this city. Major Penny and
Mr. Keeling are the leaders in the ar
rangements of this affair, assisted by an
honorary committee consisting of Ser
geants Plrla of Company E, Brown of

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1899.
RIOT AVERTED
BY OFFICERS
WITH RIFLES
Quarrymen Object to
Bill of Fare.
STRUCK FOR MORE PAY
1
WOULD STOP OTHERS FROM
WORKING.
Chief Fletcher and a Few Men With
Winchesters Soon Clear
. the Field of the
l Strikers. .
Oakland. Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 11.
The timely appearance of a large divis
ion of police armed with short, wicked
looking Winchester rifles probably pre
vented bloodshed at the Piedmont quarry
this morning. The trouble was caused by
a disagreement over the bill of fare put
up by the boarding-house keepers at the
quarry. ."â¢;'â¢'
Last Saturday about a dozen men quit
work and their places were filled on Mon
day morning with new men. The strikers
did not move away, but hung around,
threatening trouble. Last night the po
lice were asked for an officer, and Detec
tive Hodgkins was sent out. All was quiet
till this morning, when the strikers gath
ered around and caused it to be known
that they would interfere with their suc
cessors, and as some of them were
armed, a riot was imminent. )
Chief Fletcher, Captain Wilson. Detec
tive Shorey and Officers Curtis. Andrews
and Pardee filled the patrol wagon and
with their guns went to the quarry. Chief
Fletcher ordered the strikers to go to the
office, get their time, and then vacate the
premises. There was very little opposi
tion, the sight of the officers, and espe
cially the Winchesters, having a pro
nounced effect. Two police officers, armed,
were left on the scene and will not be
withdrawn for a day or two.
"The principal grievance of the strik
er.,'' said one of the company's officials,
"Is that they are not treated properly by
the boarding-house keepers at the quarry.
They claimed that the food furnished was
not good enough and the sleeping quarters
not to their liking. Finally, they demand
ed that their wages be Increased from
$1 50 to $1 75 a day. The company was
unable to satisfy the demand or the men
for better food and quarters, as the board
ing-house keepers leased the place, and
the men need not stay there unless they
desired to. They could board anywhere.
The wages paid by us are good and we
could not accede to a raise."
TURNED SUDDENLY INSANE.
Mrs. Anna Dockhan of Oakland
Creates Considerable Excite
ment at the Ferry.
Mrs. Anna Dock nan. the divorced wife
of the editor of the Haywards Review,
created considerable excitement at the
ferry yesterday morning. She came
across from Oakland with her daughter,
a bright girl 9 years of age, to purchase
tickets for Belding. Mich., where her
brother, -William Coulter, lives, but ap
peared to suddenly become Insane. Ser
geant : Avon endeavored to pacify her,
and was struck in the face, receiving a
black eye. Her screams attracted a
crowd, who watched the struggle be
tween her and the sergeant.
She was sent to the insane ward in the
Receiving Hospital, where she had to be
strapped down on her cot. During the
afternoon she became quieter and talked
rationally. She was "divorced from her
husband eighteen months ago. and has
since been working to support herself
and girl. The constant fear that her
husband would take the girl from her
drove her insane, but it did not develop
into an acute stage until yesterday.
The Sheriff took charge of the little
girl, and sent a deputy with her to Oak
land to a Mrs. Pearson, on Tenth street,
where Mrs. Dockhan boarded.
FOR WRONGING A GIRL.
W. F. Rau. a Waiter, Arrested on
Complaint of Indignant Parents.

night by Officers Coleman and Kane and
charged with an assault on Lena Shenk,
a girl living on Tehama street. Had he

girl was searching for the prisoner with
evil Intent.

ters and discovered his love for their
daughter. They closely questioned the

SUNDAY NIGHT THIEVES.
Davis-Street Cigar Store Bobbed of
Valuable Goods.
Thieves entered' the store of Henry
Lichtenstein, 25 Davis street, Sunday
night and carried off 2700 cigars valued at
$60 a thousand. The Yale lock was picked
and carried off with the other booty.
This is the second time within five
months that this store has been burglar
ized and Lichtenstein is now wondering
what good it does him to have police pro
tection and pay extra for a special watch
man. On both occasions the work was
evidently that of novices at the business
of burglary, but in the former no clew
was ever found to the perpetrators. Mr.
Lichtenstein says that owing to the ne
cessity for additional police protection at
the ferries on Sunday nights the district
in which his store lies is left without ad
equate protection and thieves fined easy
work.
Mechanics' Fair Plans.
At a meeting last night of the directors
of Mechanics' Institute to consider mat
ters connected with the fair to be
opened September 2 at the Pavilion, Sec
retary Cumming reported that a number
of people had already applied for space.
It was decided to send. out next week the
preliminary announcement of the fair,
immediately after which the work of gel
ting the project into shape will be com
menced. A meeting will be held next Fri
day to appoint an agent to look after the
collection and installation of the exhibits.
An exhibit of the products of the Phil
ippines, the first of its kind in this coun
try, will be one of the features of tin
fair. It is being collected by Lieutenant
A. P. Hayne
The Association Lunch To-Day.
The Baptist and Christian churches will
hold forth and provide the luncheon at
the old building of the Young Men's
Christian Association, 232 Sutter street,
to-day from 11 to 2 o'clock. The ladles of
the various denominations arc vying
with each other to see who will provide
the most appetizing lunch. Yesterday the
Presbyterian ladles had a large crowd
and did a thriving business. The Metho
dists come on to-morrow and the closing
day, Friday, the Congregationallsts.
Complained to the Police.
S. Monks, who .conducts a hair store at
122 McAllister street, visited police head
quarters last night and requested the

THEY RIDICULE IT.
Many People Ridicule the Idea of an
Absolute Cure for Dyspepsia
And Stomach Troubles.
Ridicule, However, Is Not Argu-
ment, and Facts Are Stub-
born Things.
Stomach troubles are so common and in
most cases so obstinate to cure that peo- j
i pie are apt to look .with suspicion on any
remedy claiming- to be a radical, perma- ;
nent cure, for dyspepsia and Indigestion. I
Many such pride themselves on their
acutenesa In never being humbugged, es- I
pecially in medicines.
"This fear of being humbugged can be ;
carried too far; so far, in fact, that many
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money in faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets.
Now, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different in one important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines for
the reason that they are not a secret pat- j
ent patent medicine; no secret is made :
of their Ingredients, but analysis shows
them to contain the natural digestive
ferments, pure asceptlc pepsin, the diges- i
tive acids, Golden Seal, bismuth, hydras-
tls and nux. They are not cathartic, i
neither do they act powerfully on any .
organ, but they cure indigestion on the
common-sense plan of digesting the food
eaten thoroughly before it has time to
ferment, sour and cause the mischief.
This Is the only secret of their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never
can cure indigestion and stomach troub- I
les because they acj entirely on the bow- ,
els, whereas the whole trouble Is really
in the stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals digest the food. That is all there !
Is to It. Food not digested or half digest-
ed is poison as it creates gas, acidity, i
headaches, palpitation of the heart, loss
of flesh and appetite and many other
troubles which are often called by some I
other name.
They are sold by druggists everywhere j
at 50 cents per package. Address F. A. ;

WYOMING, PREMIER ACROBAT

ULAR RAG-TIME.
Horton Had. His Colors Lowered by
Monta_n_s Alary's Garter a
â Three Choices â¢
Downed.
Gualala, the fast filly which races in
the colors of Marcus Daly, tho Montana
millionaire, and Is trained by the veteran
Dan Dennlson, celebrated her sixth vic
tory at Oakland track yesterday. She
â¢was allotted XX) pounds In the six-furlong
handicap, and with McNichols on her
back tiptoed her company all the way,
boating out Aluminum a scant head In
1:14 flat. The latter, thrown in with a
"catch," came very near being a surprise.
Allyar, which seems to have no speed
since Pat Dunne let him go, run a disap
pointing third.
There was nothing connected with the
day's racing deserving of special mention
outside of an acrobatic performance or
two. Three favorites were disposed of.
The "corkscrew twister" turned by
Wvomlng. with Shields tip. in the mile
and a sixteenth run, was appreciated by
all those speculators who backed the
horse on Saturday* last, when he ruled
favorite and ran unplaced. Yesterday,
over the same route, ti to 1 was chalked
against the Brown entry and he won with
ludicrous ease. De Happy, a 12 to 1 shot,
finished second, and -Roadrunner, against
which 100 to 1 was laid, ran third. Hardly,
the favorite, showed to poor advantage.
Lady Meddlesome, favorite for the in
troductory sprint over the Futurity
course, was unable to get a mark. She
showed speed to the stretch and then
fell back beaten. Thorpe managed to get
the second choice Dolore away in front
and was never headed. Heigh Ho, with
116 pounds up, finished strong, causing the
â winner to be ridden out.
The mile and a sixteenth selling run
saw a brilliant array of "crabs" face the
barrier. Einstein, with Bassinger in the
paddle, closed a slight favorite over
Major Hooker, and leading most of the
"journey won cleverly from the latter.
Kllev landed Kosemaid In the show.
"Daggle" Smith's cam.- colt Horton was
beaten again in the third number, a
sprinting affair. Slow to begin, he made
up a deal of ground, but could not catch
Montanus, which won easily. Ach, a 100
to 1 shot, led into the stretch and then

THE SAN EBAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1899.
SHOT THE MAN WHO
WRECKED HIS HOME
JOSEPH CLARK ON TRIAL FOR
' MURDER.
Elements of Self-Defense and Tem
porary Insanity Will Enter
Into the Defense of
the Prisoner.
The trial of Joseph Clark for the killing
of Joseph P. Gross, which occurred No
vember 30, 1898, in front of the fire engine
house on Stockton street, between Pa
cific and Broadway, Is progressing
rapidly in Judge Dunne's 'court. The
trial promises interesting developments.
Clark, the defendant, claims that Gross
had been intimate with his wife, and, in
fact, Mrs. Clark left her husband about
three months before the shooting, went
to live away from him and took. Gross
Into her home as a boarder. Clark says
that the dead man broke up his home
through questionable means and the loss
of his wife turned his mind arid culmi
nated in his arrest for murder. Although
the defendant does not deny that he de
liberately killed Gross, a certain element
of self-defense will enter into the case, as
it Is contended that when the two men
met just before the killing Gross made
a threatening movement and then a bul
let from Clark's revolver ended his life.
Louis P. Boardman, who made the last
appeal for Durrant before the United
States Supreme Court, and H. Dlgby
Johnston are representing the prisoner.
Reliance for acquittal of the defendant
rests upon the contended justification of
the killing through Gross' acts in wreck
ing Clark's home, while if this fails a
technical fight on the ground of Insanity,
the element of self-defense and other
points will be made*
After the jury -was impaneled yesterday
George W. Russell was placed upon the
stand to explain the chart he had drawn
of the engine-house, where the killing
took place, Thomas J. Coogan, a fireman,
was next sworn. He proved a reluctant
witness, at least when it came to cross
examination, and caused heated â words
between the court and counsel for the
defense. He admitted having been to
Mrs. Clark's home with the dead man
and had been told by the deceased that
he "boarded" with the defendant's wife.
Dr. Campbell Ford was called to testify
that he was summoned after the fatal
shot had been fired and found Gross dead,
and Fireman John J. Mahoney was put
on the stand to testify to equally formal
matters, after which the case went over
till to-day.
Death of Capitalist Gregory.
George D. Gregory, a retired capitalist,
70 years old, died at St. Luke's Hospital
last Sunday from an abscess caused by
colliding with a post in the dark a short
time ago. -v,.':>

HUNTINGTON TRIUMPHS
BY A MASTER STROKE
Secret of the Deal in Which Crocker
Capitulated.
The Aged Manipulator Tricks His Young Rival Into
Submission and Obtains a Power for Which Be
Fought in Vain for Years.
THE truth in reference to the re
cent railroad deal in which H. E.
Huntington was shorn of his au
thority as the first assistant to
his. uncle, C. P. Huntington, is
gradually becoming public property.
Railroad people, local financiers and
men of affairs see clearly that C. F.
Huntington, crafty and clever, has won
perhaps the most emphatic diplomatic
triumph in his lons and brilliant career
as a financier. Instead of jeopardizing
or sacrificing to the Crocker and Stan
ford factions in the Southern Pacific
Company any of his vast interests or
his coveted power Huntington has
tricked his bitter enemies in the com
pany Into a submission to his absolute
will. Through the inexperience of
George Crocker the wily president of
the Southern Pacific has gained in a
single day what had been for years an
impossibility. Crocker has abandoned
to the old man everything and has re
ceived nothing in return. Huntington
has given to Crocker the pomp of bogus
power and retained for himself the
substance of authority. More than
that the old railroad magnate has
wheedled into his hands that -which no
struggle would, nave gained for him.
He has destroyed the danger of the
Crocker and Stanford factions that
constantly menaced him and after
years of intense antagonisms and
shrewd manipulation he is now the
dominating spirit in the great corpora
tion of which before he was simply a
factor. He has given to George
Crocker the mantle of the second vice
president and has sneaked oft* with the
throne.
In this aspect the recent deal in the
railroad company is of exceptional pub-
lie interest. For th* 1 first time in the
history of the families who projected
and built the Central Pacific and
Southern Pacific railroads Huntington
has complete control and he has re
ceived it from the son of his bitter
enemy. During his lifetime Charles F.
Crocker fought the ambition of Hunt
ington. At his death Fred Crocker con
tinued the battle. ..eland Stanford had
also bitterly opposed the pretensions of
Huntington and Mrs. Stanford has fol
lowed in her husband's footsteps. The
Stanford and Crocker factions were al
ways allies. George Crocker went into
the Southern Pacific Company to con
tinue the battle which his father and
brother had fought and to hold over
the head of Huntington the firebrand
Of opposition.
In this struggle, continuing through
years, Huntington was always more
powerful than his enemies, but in order
to win much he had to give some and
now, without giving anything, he has
won all. Shrewd men. who under
stand the situation, shrug their should
ers when they refer to George Crocker,
and declare knowingly and with a
smile, that wiser men in the field of
finance and diplomacy have discovered
to their cost that C. P. Huntington Is
more than their match in that game
where something is obtained for noth
ing. In other words, railroad men
have awakened to the interesting
knowledge that C. P. Huntington has
sold George Crocker a gold brick and
did not even have the courtesy to allow
Crocker to test the filings.
This is why railroad men consider the

recent deal the greatest triumph in
Huntington's career of craft. He can
do now as he pleases with the vast in
terests involved in the Southern Pa
cific Company. There is no longer a
check upon his judgment or upon his
policy, and those who should know
say that Mrs, Stanford, to say the
least, is fearful for the future of her in
terests. No one believes seriously for
a moment that C. P. Huntington has
sacrificed or in any way injured his
nephew, H. E. Huntington, who has
been for years the trusted agent and
personal representative of his uncle on
this coast.
When Colonel Fred Crocker was bit
terly engaged in the war upon Hunt
ington and had the Stanford interests
in complete alliance with him, Hunt
ington found it absolutely necessary
for the protection of his interests on this
side of the continent to send his nephew
to this city. The younger Huntington
watched these interests carefully, criti
cally and with satisfaction to his uncle.
The younger man enjoyed the utmost
confidence of the elder, and when
George Crocker, upon the death of his
brother, entered the directory of the
Southern Pacific Company, avowedly
to oppose the policy of the president,
young Huntington had occasion still
to retain the deepest friendship of his
uncle.
Nor has he lost it now, for C. P.
Huntington is too seasoned a manipu
lator to leave his stronghold unguarded
even after the capitulation of the
enemy. Notwithstanding the fact that
George Crocker has surrendered the
Stanford interests as well as his own
C. P. Huntington has still the need of
the nephew. "While the position of first
assistant to the president has been
abolished George Crocker has received
nothing in return. He has none of the
power which the first assistant wielded.
Crocker has not been advanced in au
thority. He has simply made C. P.
Huntington the dictator of the great
corporation. As long as George Crocker
is obedient to the will and subservient
to the policy of C. P. Huntington there
will be no need of a first assistant to
the president. But when George Crocker
again swings that firebrand of his the
nephew will once more appear. He will
not be far away, as he is still a director
of the Southern Pacific Company and
the president of the Market-street
Company. C. P. Huntington has trap
ped too many old birds to be caught,
himself by a young one.
Ever since the death of Colonel Fred
Crocker this great denouement in the
railroad has been expected and feared.
Colo-Pel Fred Crocker had fought with
uncompromising effort against the per
sistent encroachments of Huntington in
the company. In this struggle Fred
Crocker was the representative" of the
Stanford interests as well as his own.
He could not be browbeaten, and Hunt
ington, shrewd as he is, could not trick
him. HUS
When Colonel Fred Crocker died the
Stanford and Crocker interests were
without a logical representative or a
champion to continue* the campaign
against Huntington. Will Crocker could
not be prevailed upon to take up the
burden for a double reason. He knew
nothing about the intricate art of rail
roading of which Huntington is a mas
ter, and besides his preference was for
Other pursuits. As a matter of fact
George Crocker knew no more than his
brother 'about railroads. George Crocker
had given absolutely no attention either
to railroads or to finance, in both of
which Huntington rules without a
rival.
In desperation, however, George
Crocker was chosen as the representa
tive of the two factions which had
fought so lone to preserve the integrity
of their interests against the under
mining influence of the President.
Crocker had full knowledge of his in
experience. Utterly without training
he was selected to give battle to one of
the shrewdest and craftiest manipula
tors of the age and admittedly one of
the greatest financiers of the century.
Through long years of uncertainty,
with war within and war without,
Huntington had handled with a superb
mastery the enormous interests that he
had acquired. When other railroads
had come upon evil times and receivers
were at their doors Huntington smil
ingly continued to mind his own busi
ness, interfered discreetly in the busi
ness of other people and paid his inter
est regularly. He had locked horns
with the Goulds and the Vanderbilts
and had not come second best from the
contest. He had been in many a great
battle of manipulation and intrigue of
finance and as some one said: "No one
was ever able to get his knife under
the pie crust of C. P. Huntington."
And then George Crocker went and
purchased a pie knife. It was his an
nounced purpose to oppose Huntington
in everything. The old man could not
force him out altogether and George
Crocker was determined not to be
fooled. If he was no match in diplo
macy for Huntington he could at least
fight. The battle has ended. Th*
Crocker and Stanford interests in the
Southern Pacific Company are now
what they never were before â subser
vient to C. P. Huntington. What
Charles F. â¢ Crocker, Leland Stanford,
Colonel Fred Crocker and Mrs. Stan
ford fought for has been lost and
George Crocker thinks he has won a
victory. C. P. Huntington never says
what he thinks. â¢Â«
In this factional fight for supremacy
in the Southern Pacific Company a
feature of minor interest has been dis
played. During the lifetime of Colonel
Fred Crocker the big yellow building
of the corporation was divided into two
bitterly antagonistic factions. The fight
between Colonel Crocker and Hunting
ton was taken up by their respective
followers. Heads of departments were
in one camp or the other. They chose
their standard as they believed success
would come. There were Huntington
men and Crocker men. and the feeling
was so bitter that even clerks were ar
rayed against each other.
This condition of affairs has con
tinued to the present time. Railroad
men are wondering now if the follow
ers of Crocker and those in the Stan
ford faction will feel the weight of
Huntington's anger. Crocker's capitu
lation has made the old man absolute
master of the great corporation after
years of struggle, worry, intrigue and
culminating triumph. It may be that
Huntington will now pay his debts of
spite.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1899.
HIS TIRELESS WORK
FINDS ITS REWARD
General Dickinson
the Recipient of a
.Handsome Token
From Jiis Jldmip
er_,
YESTERDAY General John H. Dickinson was the recipient of a handsome
silver punch bowl, presented to him by the attaches of the investigating
committee of State institutions appointed by the Senate two years ago, as
a manifestation of their appreciation of his efforts while chairman
of the committee. Among the presentees were: Frank M. Brandon, sec
retary of the committee; Bliss & Flaville and Reid - Brothers, architects;
Messrs. Mott and Van Court, stenographers, and the other clerks and secre
taries of the investigating body. â  .-,' 7
When the 'committee received its commission two years ago it immediately,
set to the task of making, a complete and thorough examination into the af
fairs of many State institutions. This required several months of- most assid
uous labor, during which time Dickinson performed his share in such a man
ner as to relieve the burdens of his associates. As a result a voluminous and
graphic report was handed over to the last session of the legislative body.
The general's energy proved untiring, and his assistants recognizing this,
took occasion to present him with a memento of their respect and confi
dence. w3_&
The bowl is a handsome speciment of workmanship, having inscribed on
one side the following: "To General John H. Dickinson, from Appreciative
Friends. March 19, 1599." On the other side are the initials, ''J. H. D."

the Dollar.
Yesterday the terms of the contract by
which Freeman & James of New York
City, agents for the Vanderbilts, came
into control of the West Shore Railroad
were given out to the public, and the an
nouncement was made that the work of
construction would be begun within the
next sixty days.
By the terms of the contract Freeman
& James take at the rate of nt cents on
the dollar all of the $2,000,000 bond issue
which the Joost people have for so long
tried unsuccessfully to float. Also they
take 67 per cent of the stock of the com
pany, leaving the balance .to.be. divided
among the stockholders in amounts pro
portionate to their present holdings.
The New York agent's further guarantee
to begin work on the line immediately
and that the construction shall be of the
best. There will be a large amount of
bridge work required along the route and
these bridges, it Is specified, shall be
bullded of steel. :.".*;.â .;. ',
It was denied yesterday, and with evi
dent good reason, that Joose had ever ac
quired a franchise in this county, al
though he had secured his rights of way.
This was one of the points that stood in
the way of the consummation of the deal
and was thoroughly investigated' by the
local attorneys of the New York agents.
As a result, they reported that the fran
chise matter was in as good shape as
every other phase of the transaction .and
the deal was ordered closed.
Work on the other lines is again going
on. Ninety miles of new track has just
been laid on the Utah and Pacific from
Milford, Utah, westward, and Colonel
Jones has lately returned from the East
with another block of money to go ahead
with the Fresno-Monterey connection.
The Utah line Is now but 320 miles away
from its nearest railway connection in
this State, and it is said that no more
time will be dallied away In its construc
tion now that the western terminal point
has been established.
BURGLARS WORK UNDER
THE POLICE'S EYES
RANSACKED A SALOON AND
ARE UNMOLESTED.
A burglary of unusual daring was re
ported to the police last night, and as it
occurred immediately opposite the Central
Station Captain Wittman and his officers
feel chagrined, that they did not capture
i hi- bold offenders.
When Henry Clasby, proprietor of the
Tulare Exchange, at 231 Larkin street, ar
rived at his place of business- yesterday
morning he was astounded to find his sa
loon in a wrecked condition. According
to his statement it looked as if a cyclone
had struck it. Empty bottles. were scat
tered about the place, as were also orange
skins and empty boxes. Pools of liquid
were all over the floor, and behind the bar
were empty spaces where bottles of wine
and whisky once reposed.
A further examination of the premises
disclosed the fact that the card machine
had been wrecked and its nicker recepta
cle emptied. The nickel-in-the-slot ma
chine attached to the telephone was torn
from Us fastening by the burglars. A note
pasted on the safe informed its owner that
he was "in a barrel, but his safe was un- I
touched." The thieves attempted to open
it, but were unsuccessful, much to Mr.
Clasby's satisfaction, as a large amount of
money had been placed there the night be
fore.
In searching for a clew to the unwel
come visitors the officers last night dis
covered that they had burst in a door
leading to the alley way on the Ash
avenue side, and then, without danger
from molestation, they cautiously removed
the transom over the back door leading to
the saloon. The burglars then crawled
through and began their depredation. Once
inside, they filled themselves with liquor
and then loaded themselves down with
their spoils and departed.
Their work was so stealthily done that
the people living upstairs were undis
turbed, nor waa any passer-by attracted
by the unusual visit.
Detectives have been detailed on the
case but have not as yet been able to lo
cate the thieves. â¢

idence in a beautiful home on California street, which was presented by the
bride's father, John F. Ortmann, the well-known capitalist..

ment of pharmacy of the University of California. V"
Dr. Shumate has a happy faculty of making friends, and the tatter have
shown their regard for him by sending himself and bride many costly gifts.
GRAVE SCANDAL
IN COLLECTOR
LYNCH'S OFFICE
Illegal Fees Extorted
From Chinese.
BOAST OF SEARCHER WAIT
;â¢ .
DUPLICATE CERTIFICATES' OB
TAINED THROUGH HIM.
Lawyer Schaertzer Refused to Let
His Client Be Bled and the
Grafting Scheme Was
Exposed.
A scandal has developed in the office of
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch. The
suicide of Cashier Norton under the Wel
burn administration and the exposure and
flight of his principal have barely grown
cold when an incipient case of wrong do
ing comes to light. It is a flagrant viola
tion of the Federal statutes, and if not ex
posed at this time and checked would
no doubt, prove to be the entering wedge
for greater abuses.
. It has come to' the knowledge of The
Call that under a flimsy pretense a cer
tain class of persons doing business with
the office are taxed $10 each for a service
which the law declares shall be performed
without any charge whatsoever. The fact
that Chinese persons are the only suffer
ers and that brokers for Chinese and a
hanger-on of the revenue office are the
beneficiaries is no palliation for the of
fense. Somebody has been grafting a bud
of profit on the Federal tree in defiance of
the laws and in the "oppression of a class
of people too ignorant to know how to
resist' the extortion.
The 'matter came to the knowledge of j
The Call yesterday through the refusal of
H. C. Schaertzer, a lawyer, to permit his
client to be bled out of $10 which he was
not required by law to pay. Mr. Schaertz
er. had a Chinese client, a laborer, who had
lost his registration certificate and who
was anxious to get a duplicate from In
ternal Revenue Collector Lynch. Under
the statute the Collector must furnish to
all Chinese applicants a duplicate of their
certificate of registration upon their cer
tifying that the original has been lost. For
this service the Collector is not allowed to
make any charge. This particular laborer
wished to leave for a cannery in Alaska
in a day or two, and he employed Mr.
Schaertzer to get him, the duplicate re
quired.
The Collector was temporarily absent
from his office when Mr. Schaertzer called
with his client and an Interpreter, and he
stated his errand to Chief Deputy Frick.
Mr. Frick informed the lawyer that it
would be probably a week or more before
he would be able to supply him with a
duplicate, one reason being that several
bundles of the certificates were being
bound in a downtown printing establish
ment and that they would not be available
until the work of binding was completed.
Mr. Schaertzer offered to go to the print
ing office and make the search himself,
but Deputy Frick informed him that the
binder would not allow him to handle the.
certificates. â¢* In vain the lawyer pleaded
that his client had to leave the State
within a day or two and could not go with
safety without the duplicate certificate.
The deputy could do nothing for him.
The lawyer and his client had barely got
outside Mr. Lynch's office when they were
approached by an elderly man named
Wait, whom Schaertzer recognized as a
hanger-on of the revenue office and who
had been employed for three or four
months last year in making an index of
the Chinese certificates. Wait tapped the
lawyer on the shoulder and said that he
could get the duplicate for his client with
out delay if the lawyer would pay him $10

He then exhibited a paper signed by sev
eral brokers for Chinese in the following
language, as near as Mr. Schaertzer was
able to remember:
We, the undersigned, hereby agree that the
following prices shall prevail in the matter of
obtaining duplicate registration certificates for
Chinese: For preparing papers, $10; for search
ing for papers where the number is given. $10;
total, $20. For preparing papers where the
number is not given. $10; for searching for pa
pers where the number is. not given, 51"; total,
$25. In case of extra search or in cases where
extra time is required to ascertain the number
a proportionate amount will be charged for
services.
The lawyer decided that he was up
against a skin game. He turned to Wait
and flatly refused to be bled even to the.
extent of a nickel. He then 'went to his
office, whither he was followed by the
persistent Wait.
"How much are you getting for this?"
he asked the lawyer. "That is none of
your business," replied Mr. Schaertzer.
"I am getting more than the price named
in your schedule, but I don't propose to
give you a dollar."
Then Wait, glancing at the number of
the Chinaman's certificate, said that the
number was Incorrect and that the name
had not been rightly given. Having thus
raised the proper feeling of alarm Wait
fired another shaft which he expected
would find the mark.
"Collector Lynch will not allow any
body else but me in that vault to handle
the certificates, and he is willing that I
should collect something for my
trouble."
The lawyer flatly refused to enter into
negotiations with the favorite of Col
lector Lynch, and the interview termi
nated.
An hour later Collector Lynch was
asked whether he made any charge for
issuing duplicate certificates of registra
tion or whether he had authorised any
one to issue them for a fee. Mr. Lynch
replied that there was no charge for the
duplicate, and thai he had not author
ized any one to make any charge for the
service. When told that Wait had been
acting as an agent for the issuance of
duplicates and had represented, that he
had exclusive privileges in handling the
papers, Mr. Lynch, with a show of indig
nation, said that he would bar Wait from
his office, and that he had not been
aware that he, the ex-indexer, had been
making money out of the revenue office
In the next breath Mr. Lynch said tnat
Wall was a poor man, and that he had
assisted lawyers and others in getting
out the duplicates, and he (Lynch) had
"not desired to stand in the way of the
old man making a living, but he did not
indorse Wait s making a charge for his
services. The inference was drawn from
the Collector's remarks that Wait had
been receiving a gratuity voluntarily be
stowed by the lawyers and brokers
whom Wait had assisted by his knowl
edge of the Chinese certificates and the
method of picking them out.
"l won't let him in my office any
more said Mr. Lynch. Then he pro
ceeded to tell that only a few days be
fore he himself had gone to the bindery
for a Chinaman who was in a hurry to
leave the city and had got a duplicate
for himâ to accommodate the China
man.
Deputy Frick remarked that "that man
ait" had bothered him a good deal, and
he wished that he could be kept out of
the office.
About a year' ago, before Wait and an
other man had been employed to index
the certificate., The Call learned that
some clerks In Collector Lynch'- office
had been charging or receiving fees of
$3 each for finding certificates and issu
ing duplicates. One of these clerks was
said to be Dillard, the colored messen
ger; who was a principal witness against
ex-Collector .Welbiirn. It was reported
that Dillard used to work overtime in
getting out duplicates, and that he was
paid by the brokers for his trouble, but
Dillard denied that he ever received a
cent. The Call's expose at that time
drew the attention of the Secretary of
the Treasury to the matter, with the re
sult that an appropriation was made for
the purpose of having the certificates in
dexed so that duplicates could be issued
without any loss of time. All but a few
of the certificates have been indexed, and
they have been arranged and bound ac
cording to their numbers, so that a cer
tificate can be found by its number in
not more than two minutes.
In the meantime Schaertzer's client
must postpone his trip to the salmon
fisheries of 'Alaska until the binding job
is finished and he can get his duplicate,
which will be some time next week. The
present exposure wiM have the effect of
reducing the brokers' fees for duplicates
from $20 to $10, there being no necessity
for continuing the $10 fee to Mr. W ait.
