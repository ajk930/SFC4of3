E RETORT A, Transvaal Republic,
May 17. â The seven alleged revolu-
Monists. who presented the appear-
ance of ordinary loafers, were ar
raigned in court to-day, charged with
the capital offense of high treason.
They were remanded for a fortnight.
Sworn affidavits alleged that 2000 men
have been enrolled for military service.
and that It was intended to arm thorn
in Natal, to return to the Rand. and.
at a given signal, to seize and hold the
fort of Johannesburg for twenty-four
hours pending the arrival of British
troops.
The press says the Government re
gards the matter as "an unfortunate
local Incident which will not affect the
general political situation." The Gov
ernment also confirms the report that
the arrangements between President
Kruger and the Governor of Cane Col
ony, li ign Commissioner of South Afri
ca Sir Alfred Milner, for a meeting at

Free State, are nearly completed. The
President's proposed reforms will be

pudiates any connection with the en
listment of men for any purpose.
Fries was the only prisoner who did
not appear to-day at the Pretoria court
for arraignment. The streets, were
thronged and the prisoners were es
corted under a strong guard from the

possession of the town until the British
troops from Natal could come to their as
sistance.
One of the prisoners alleges that he
was acting under instructions from 'the
British War Department.
In response to inquiries made on the
subject in Government circles the cc-r-
respondent here of the Associated Press
was told to-day that the report that
the men arrested at Johannesburg had
acted under instructions from the
British War Office "were too absurd
for refutation."
A representative of the Associated
Press to-day saw a number of promi- !

dealing with the laws and observances
of war which did not lead to the con
clusion of any convention, and the cir
cular of the Dutch Minister ofvForeign
Affairs in 1871 relating to the adoption
of the principle of inviolability of pri
vate property and urging a clearer defi

They declared they had not received a
word from their own agents in Cape
Colony, the absence of advices indicat
ing that the affair was "trumped up"
by the Boer police, and that in any case
the men arrested were irresponsible
in -bodies with fictitious military titles
affixed by the Boers with the object of
discrediting the British in the eyes of
the Continental powers. It is now be
lieved Tromlett was formerly a cap
tain of volunteers in Cape Colony, and
that he is now a mining agent; Patter
son Is described as a butcher and a la
bor agitator; Mitchell is said to be a
storekeeper; Cooper is classed as a car
penter; Ellis is alleged to be a private
detective, and the occupations of Fries
and Nicholls are unknown.
A prominent Uitlander said to the
representative of the Associated Press:
â -"My own view. is that a few irre
sponsible men met together to discuss
means of defense In case the necessity
for such action arose. Those who are
acquainted with Johannesburg know
that such precautions are necessary.
There was the greatest unrest and fer
ment there when I left. But the state
ment that there has been a conspiracy
during the past four months, and that
the South African League was con
nected with it, is untrue. No Uitlander
is allowed to possess a rifle, yet at every
corner are policemen armed with rifles
and revolvers. The feeling of alarm
on the arrival of the Boer artillery can
be conceived.
"It Is a significant fact that the
men arrested are practically unknown,
showing that the feeling which in 1895
was limited to the capitalistic class has
now gene lower down and has reached
the ordinary working class of shop
keepers of Johannesburg."

LOS ANGELES, May 17.â Worried
by numerous debts, L. J. Rose,
the pioneer viticulturist of Cali
fornia and one of the best-known
turfmen in the United States, endel
his life to-day. Rose swallowed a
large dose of morphine while stand
ing in the chicken yard at the rear
of his mansion at the corner of
Fourth street and Grand avenue. In
spite of the efforts of two physicians
he died at 11:30 o'clock this forenoon,
one hour after he was found.
A few days ago Mr. Rose went to
San Francisco to obtain a loan. He
was unsuccessful and returned to Los
Angeles. Yesterday morning he went
to Ventura to borrow money. The sum
he wanted was a large one and he could
not obtain it. Mr. Rose returned from
Ventura last night, apparently in his
usual health and spirits. Developments
show, however, that he determined last
night to destroy himself. Mr. Rose
wrote a letter to- his wife in which he
said he was "swamped financially"
and would not be alive much longer.
"You will find my remains in the
chicken yard," were the concluding
words of the letter.
This letter was found by a member
of Mr. Rose's household soon after 10
o'clock this morning and search was
at once instituted for Mr. Ruse, who
was found lying unconscious in the
chicken yard.
Mr. Rose was carried to his bedroom
and Drs. W. W. Hitchcock and David
son were hurriedly summoned. The
physicians worked over Mr. Rose for
an hour, but did not "succeed in reviv
ing him. Several members of the fam
ily were at his bedside when he died.
Coroner Holland, who was notified of
the suicide at noon, went to the house
and viewed the remains. Mr. Rose's
relatives were anxious to have the , In
quest held immediately, and the Coro
ner said he would hold it this evening.
Mrs. Rose is an invalid and the news
of her husand's death was a severe
blow. She Is prostrated by grief.
In the history of California and of
racetracks there was no better-known
man than Mr. Rose. To him Is due the
credit of developing the wine Industry
of Southern California. He came to
Los Angeles in IS6O and acquired the
Sunny Slope ranch near San Gabriel.
Under his management the ranch be
came famous as a vineyard and the
choicest wines were made on the place.
The dead man was a great lover of
horses and he had' a large stable.
Mr. Rose bred Stamboul, one of the
greatest trotting stallions that ever
lived. He also bred Alcazar, The Moore
and other famous trotters. Mr. Rose
turned his attention to running horses
and had a string which was known all
over the United States. He was well
known at Saratoga, Long Branch and
other racetracks.
Mr. Rose spent his money like , a
prince and was known as a man who
would not "hedge" on any proposition.
He won and lost thousands of dollars
on the racetrack, but no one ever heard
him complain when fortune turned
against him. Mr. Rose sold the Sunny
Slope ranch to an English syndicate
about ten years ago. It Is said that the
property brought $1,000,000.
Soon after he sold the Sunny Slope
ranch Mr. Rose built a home at the
corner of Fourth street and Grand ave
nue. The house was then the most
costly and beautiful in Los Angeles.
Mr. Rose spared no expense to make
his home luxurious and he Imported
fine woods for the floors and staircases.
He dressed the walls with rare paint
ings and bric-a-brac, and poured out
his money to make his home comfort
able and beautiful. ; ,;
Mr. Rose leaves a widow and eight
children. Five married daughters and
three sons reside in this city. The
daughters are Mrs. Nina Wachtel, Mrs.
Annie Sanderson, Mrs. J. W. Montgom
ery, Mrs. George Easton and Mrs. Al
bert Pilse. The sons are Harry Rose,
L. J. Rose Jr. and Guy Rose.
No arrangements for the funeral have
yet been considered.
Leonard John Rose was born in Ba
varia, Germany, in 1827. His parents
immigrated to the United States when
he was 12 years of age. The family re
sided at Waterloo, 111., while Mr. Rose
attended - Shurtliff College in Alton.
After leaving school he settled at
Qulncy, where he engaged In the dry
goods business for a number of. years.
Then he removed to Van Buren County,
lowa, .where he continued in the same
line of business. â¢'â â ;-
Mr. Rose started for California, and
after many hardships he finally reached
and settled in the old city of Santa Fe,
N. M., where he engaged in the hotel
business. During the two years . that
he managed the hotel it was financially
successful and - when Mr. Rose and his
family removed to Los Angeles he was
comparatively, a wealthy man.-: He
bought the Sunny slope' ranch Jof 2000
acres and In; a few years increased its
annual output of wine from a few hun
dred gallons to 750.000 gallons of differ
ent kinds of wine and 125,000 gallons of

MANILA, May 17.â Although the
rebels still threaten San Fer
nando in considerable force.
large numbers of natives, a ma
jority of them having families with
their household goods, are moving daily
to the towns inside the American lines,
at Apalit. especially.
Many of the richer Filipinos are com
ing to Manila and laborers are resum
ing work in the rice fields. The latter
show their respect' for American sover
eignty by removing their hats to the
passing trains carrying troops.
Owing to the bad condition of the
wagon roads the work of repairing the
railroad is being actively pushed. All
the broken bridges haver been .trestled
and only a few excavations, remain to
be filled up. Trains will undoubtedly be
running through to San Fernando in a
few days. The only natives there are
some Filipinos from Macabebe who are
trading with our soldiers. ,
At daylight to-day Lieutenant Hill.
who, with twenty-five men .of the
Fourth Infantry, was concealed. in the
trenches near Pasig. was attacked by a
force of rebels who evidently Imagined
they could capture one of our outposts
because only a few shots had been fired
by the American force.' A few volleys
put the enemy to flight,* the, rebels los
ing five men killed and a number of
wounded.
The army gunboat Napidan has re
turned here from the lake, having been
disabled by a cannon shot from a rebel
position near Santa Cruz, which broke
her rudder post.
MANILA, May 18.â Major Kobbes
column reached San Luis, eight miles
up the Rio Grande, yesterday, meeting
With but slight opposition. One man
was wounded during a brush with the
rebels. '!:y"'l'i'2~':-- ,
At daybreak to-day the American
began a further advance toward Can
da ha. about six miles up the river be
yond San Luis.
The insurgents along General Mac-
Arthur's front evacuated their posi
tions during the night time, presumably
moving further up the railroad.
The Twenty-third Infantry has sailed
on the transport Leon XIII for Jolo Isl
and to relieve the Spanish garrison
there.
Agulnaldo and his Cabinet are report
ed to have met at San Isidro before the
Americans arrived and captured that
place and decided to send a commission
to Otis Ito accept the terms of the
proclamation. General Lawton was un
aware of this decision when he ; ad
vanced upon the city. The Filipino
leaders then retired, but a commission
bearing Aguinaldo's submission is ex
pected to-morrow. -(
LAWTON DRIVING THE
ENEMY TO THE MOUNTAINS
WASHINGTON, May 17.â That the
Insurgents are disintegrated and de
moralized is perfectly manifest from
the press dispatches and the cable news
from General Otis received ' to-day.
GeneralLawton, who was pushing I the
line of the rebel retreat along the Rio
Grande, has flung his advance, which at
last advices was resting at San Miguel,
northward about . twelve - miles, has
taken San Isidro, the second insurgent
capital, and when .General Otis' dis- |
patch was sent was still pressing the
enemy northward. The fact that he is |
sustaining few losses in his forward -
movement, although in almost con- j
tinual contact with the enemy, is an
other proof of their utter demoraliza- '
tion. According to General Otis' cable
they continue to throw up ihtrench
ments, but General Lawton's strategy j
outflanks each position in turn, keep- j
ing them in full retreat and giving |
them no opportunity to reorganize
their scattered forces. It will, soon be ;
the mountains or the sea for the in
surgents. As our troops could be trans
ported by sea to the mouth of the Agn.o '
and a new base of operations estab
lished there it would be folly for them
to take that course. Scattered,' demor- j
alized and disheartened it Is almost
certain that the rebels in desperation
will retreat Into the fastnesses of the i
mountains, where they, would be safe |
from. pursuit . and where they could
keep up, a guerrilla warfare indefinitely ;
until their leaders came to their senses. '
Over fifty-five miles, as the crow files, j
the rebels have been forced back.
The situation of tne insurgents is ;
desperate. Mac-Arthur's division drove !
them back along the line of the railroad
toward Dagupan, on the bay of Lin
gayen, as. far as Calumpit. All efforts
to impede his progress by the destruc
tion of bridges was frustrated. ' The in- j
surgents were forced out of their
strongest positions. Simultaneously i
General Lawton. moved to the right !
in a wide detour toward Norzaga Bay,
the eastern limit of open country, with I
the intention of turning the enemy's '
position- and crushing him between the
two columns. Although unsuccessful j
in this, the enemy, to- make good his j
escape, was compelled to abandon his !
line of retreat along the railroad and !
retire up the Rio Grande. J The insur- j
gents by this move displayed consider- i
able adroitness in the art of war, as it j
made it incumbent upon the Americans
to get their supplies to the front along
a new line. v ;.-â â¢.
This had been comparatively easy
along the line of the railroad, which
had been repaired as the troops ad
vanced. The change in the line of re
treat of the rebels stopped Lawton's
advance for several days, It is pre
sumed; as no I movement until to-day
bad been reported since Friday. Mean
time, it is presumed, supplies were sent
forward up the Rlov Grande in cascos
(native barges), under the escort of the
gunboats commanded by Major Kobbes.
The latter was reported to have 1500
men with him designed for the rein
forcement of Lawton. The supplies
probably having arrived at a point op
posite Lawton, whose column had ad
vanced along a line several miles east
and parallel with the river, were deliv
ered to him during the push to San
Isidro. This cleared the province of
Bulacan. v ?V'
East of Norzaga Bay is a wall of
mountains extending to the sea. These
mountains run directly north on the
left flank of the rebel retreat along the
valley of the Rio Grande" to about ten
miles north of San Isidro, where they
trend westward and form the source
of that river. 5 It is into the foothills
of these mountains that Lawton is now
driving * the scattered . and demoralized
force of the. Insurgents. Lawton has
with him the Third and Twenty-second
Infantry, one battalion of the Seven

Special Dispatch to The Call. " >
Tuesday's tragedy at San Quen
tin Prison is, it woula seem from
the indications, but the forerunner
of a series. Desperate convicts
in the prison, in a state of almost
open revolt, are threatening the
lives of guards and prison offi
cials, and no steps have been taken
to restrain them.
On the other hand, the stabbing
of Guard McDonald by Oppen
heimer has so stirred public feel
ing in Marin County that the citi
zens have already organized a vig
ilance committee to lynch the con
vict when he is taken to San Ra
fael for trial.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, May 17.-v
When Guard James McDonald
was assaulted with a knife and
stabbed seven times by Convict
Jacob Oppenheimer it was prophe
sied by those familiar with the circum
stances that only the most drastic
measures would prevent others losing
their lives. This prophecy was seen to
be true to-day, the indications of a re
volt being so plain that even a blind
man might realize that a crisis waa
near at hand. Five men are in con
stant danger, among them being Dr.
Lawlor, the prison physician.
Guard McDonald's condition Is such
to-night that it is deemed a question of
only a few hours when his life will be
at an end. The knowledge of this fact
has so infuriated the rest of the guards
and the friends of McDonald in San
Rafael that it is a serious question
whether Oppenheimer will ever be tried
for the murder. A number of men are
already banded together for the pur
pose of lynching the murderer when he
is taken to San Rafael for trial, and
Sheriff Taylor, who became acquainted
with the condition of affairs this even
ing, has sworn in twenty-five men in
order to be in a position to cope with
the would-be lynchers when the time
arrives for the Marin County authori
ties to take the case of the desperate
criminal in hand.
It is now known that the murderous
assault on McDonald was planned two
weeks ago, the chief conspirators being
Oppenheimer, "Jack" O'Neill. a
life-timer, and John Phillips, alias
"Frisco Slim." Oppenheimer and
"Frisco . Slim" were in the dun
geon together and both were re
leased at the same time, about ten days
ago. While incarcerated in the dungeon
Oppenheimer was overheard to say that
he intended to kill McDonald upon the
first opportunity that was presented.
while Phillips said that the man for
whom his knife was intended was a
guard from San Rafael, named Henry
Moller. That the convicts generally
were acquainted with the intention of
these villains was evidenced yesterday
when the word went through the jute
mill that a guard had been slain.
;.~" 'Frisco Slim' has killed Henry Mol
ler," was the sentence that passed from
breaker to breaker, and many of the
convicts openly expressed their sur
prise when they learned that instead of
Moller it was McDonald who had been
stabbed.
The convicts in the jute mill were so
surly to-day and obeyed orders so
grudgingly that the slim force' of
guards became alarmed, and after v
consultation decided the condition wa*
so alarming that unless something were
done it would be really a suicidal pro
position for them to remain on duty.
Both.O'Nelll and "Frisco Slim" were so
open in their threats that several of
the "trusties" became cognizant of the
danger ahead for the guards and ac
quainted them with their perilous posi
tion.
The chief man threatened is Dr. Law
lor. Only two months ago "FriscO
Slim" made a savage assault on him id

murder might have been committed at

enough to extricate himself from a dan

incarcerated In the dungeon. In view
of his intractable nature and the trou

Prison Directors ordered him placed in
the dungeon. He was kept there until
ten days ago, when he was released by
order of Captain of the Yard J. C. Ed

Edgar and told that official the man

WILLOWS MUSICIAN
WILL TOUR EUROPE
WILLOWS, May 17â The peo
ple of Glenn County are great
ly pleased over the fact that
the talented musician. Miss
Mamie Small Randolph, has
been called to Paris by a cablegram
from her former teacher. Professor
Joseph Sancho, who has been engaged
to give a season of concerts at the
French capital. Miss Randolph is the
daughter Of Dr. and Mrs. J. A. Ran
dolph of Willows. She is a decided
blonde, of slender, willowy and graceful
form, and pretty of features. Her age
is 22. She has a wonderful talent for
music, having studied since early child
hood. Three years ago she graduated
first In her class from Beethoven Con
servatory of Music, St. Louis, Mo., and
soon thereafter took a year's course of
lessons on the mandolin and bandurria
of Professor Sancho in San Francisco.
Miss Randolph plays the piano, the
guitar, the bandurria and the mandolin
with equal excellence of execution. She
is partial to high-grade and classic
music, and will take part in the* series
of septet concerts to be given by Pro
fessor Sancho and class. Miss Ran
dolph will be the traveling companion
of Mrs. Joseph Sancho on the tour of
will be all serene m no time."
Dr. Lawlor said he would do nothing
of the kind; that if the man would
come to him of his own accord and
promise to make no more attempts on
his life he would have nothing more
to say. That was the end of the mat-
ter until the assault on McDonald by
â¢ 'ppenheimer, when Phillips renewed
his threats and said he would "do up
not only that old 'cuss' Lawlor. but
Henry Moller as well." Then "Jack"
O'Neill came out with a series of
threats, among them being a statement
that on the first opportunity he in-
tended to i kill Guard Yoho and Guard
Randolph. Randolph is Captain Ed-
gar's assistant and Yoho is the man
who arrived on the scene of the as-
sault yesterday in time to knock Op-
penheimer senseless with a cane and
thereby incur the enmity of all those
who belong to the "gang."
At 5 o'clock this evening Guards
Yoho, Holier, Leahy and Howard Mor-
row, whose life is endangered because
he happened to be on intimate terms
with McDonald, went In a body to Cap-
tain Edgar and petitioned him to place
O'Neill and Phillips in the dungeon.
These two were represented as the ring-
leaders in the plan to dispose of Dr.
Lawlor and the four guards, and the
-aptain was told that if they were not
placed where they could have no means
of counseling and encouraging the
other convicts it was only a question
of a short time when human blood.
and the blood of freemen at that, would
gÃgain stain the floor of the jute mill.
Captain Edgar is asserted to have said
that while there might be some dan-
ger It was his opinion thae*the convicts.
knowing the heated feeling existing
among the guards and officials on ac-
count of the stabbing of McDonald.
would not attempt another murder at
this time. He, therefore, refused to in-
carcerate the ringleaders, and said the
matter should be called to the atten
tion of the Prison Directors at their
next meeting. The men are exasperat-
ed at this reply, and do not hesitate
to say that if more blood is not spilled
before the next meeting of the direc-
tors it will be lucky for the marked
-lien.
McDonald's condition to-night Is re-
tarded as hopeless. He was visited by
Dr. Lawlor at 9 o'clock, and the follow-
ing statement was made by the physi
cian on leaving the office of Captain
Birlem:
"The patient has developed traumatic
pneumonia, which generally follows a
severe wound by a knife or a gunshot,
Â»nd is spitting blood. His legs have
:urned purple from the knee down and
heat has to be kept applied to them.
This discoloration is due to a sluggish
circulation, and the low condition of
McDonald may be gauged from the fact
that the discoloration is seen even at
:he neck, in the form of spots as large
is a silver dollar. The temperature is
101.4, the pulse 112 and very erratic and
:he respiration 44. It is my belief that
:he man cannot last forty-eight hours."

POLITICAL OPPOSITION
TO EXPANSION DOCTRINE
NEW YORK, May 17.â special to the!
Sun from Washington says: At a meet- j
Ing of Irish-American Republicans, held j
la the parlors of the Ebbitt House on !
Monday and Tuesday of this week, an
organization was effected which has for
its purpose energetic and organized polit- '
ical opposition to the doctrine of expan- j
slot) and retention of the Philippine Isl- !
ands by the United States.
This movement appears to have had its
origin In New York City some weeks ago,
but has been kept quiet. It was started
by several representative Irish-Ameri
cans including Colonel Patrick O'Ferrall
of this city, who is a pension and patent
attorney of wide acquaintance through
Â°H.t, Lh(L Unitt-d States. At the meeting
which has just closed a society was or
ganized and by-laws and constitution
were, adopted. Beyond the adoption of;
these rules and the appointment of a
committee to issue propaganda and con
duct an extensive correspondence, noth- I
ing was done.
The task of drawing Irish-American
citizens into the party will devolve
largely upon Colonel O'Ferrall, who is
one of the most enthusiastic members of
the organization. Colonel O'Ferrall has I
always been a Republican, and before the â¢
existence of that party was an Abolition- 1
ist. During the last Presidential cam-'
paign he was on the stump six or seven
weeks in the Interest of McKinley. Dis
cussing* the proposed organization Col- '
onel O'Ferrall to-night said; j
"I have always been a Republican, but
I am unalterably opposed to this new doc
trine of imperialism. I believe we should
confine ourselves to this continent and the
islands contiguous. We only bring new :
troubles upon ourselves by going to
Asia and endeavoring to do things which
Spain has tried to do for 300 years and
failed. So far as I am concerned, loyal â¢
publican as I have always been, I shall j
vote for the ticket of that party which
pledges itself against Imperialism and
these new doctrines that threaten to
wreck the country. We expect to have
many additions to our ranks, although
we shall do little beyond conducting cor
respondence until we see what the Re
publican party intends to do. If it is the I
policy of that party to keep the Philip- \
pines and fasten upon us an imperialism :
Inconsistent with Republican institutions,
then the mass of the Irish- Americans will I
vote against that party."

ATKINSON SPEAKS ON
"CRIMINAL AGGRESSION"
CAMBRIDGE. Mass.. May 17.â j
Cambrige Antl-Imperiallst Association I
! held a well-attended meeting to-night and
listened to a speech by Edward Atkin
| son, who took for his subject, "Criminal
â  Aggressionâ The Way Out."
After dwelling upon the dangers of an
; imperialist policy Mr. Atkinson said: ,
There Is one way, and perhaps the only j
one, by which not only can all that may
; be rightfully or lawfully done by the |
Lnited States be attained, but a preced
ent may also be established leading to '
peace and good will among all nations. |
â  That way is by agreement among the
i great naval and â¢ commercial powers of
the world to neutralize the Philippine Isl
; ands, to aid them In establishing an or
derly government and to open them on :
! equal terms granted to all nations to the ;
; commerce of the world.
T3wWha.t 6tan?s lP tll<? way of making the I
Philippine Islands and tne seas within I
their Jurisdiction neutral? For the first
time since their partial occupation by
Spain under a grant of dominion from the :
Pope, they are now free from Spanish op
pression. To subjugate them would,. ac- i
cording to our code of morality, be an i
, act of criminal aggression.
"We ought not to assume this responsi
i bility, nor ought w* to give any protec- I
tion to any other nation to assume It It ;
Is for the interest of this country, of
Great Britain. of Russia, Germany, ;
I France and Japan that these islands shall ;
become the sanctuary of free commerce *

PREPARING FOR THE
DISABLED VETERANS
WASHINGTON. May 17.-In anticipa
tion of the return of many disabled sol
diers from the Philippines, : Cuba and
Porto Rico, preparations are being made
by the authorities of the Soldiers' Home
here to largely increase the facilities and
capacity of that institution. Last year
previous to the beginning of the actual'
campaign service in the tropics,, the in
mates of the home numbered in the neigh
borhood of 750 men. Now the number has
increased to 820. None of the regulars
who have been engaged in service In the
Philipp nes have yet arrived at the home
but it Is probable that the number will
exceed that from the combined Cuban
and Porto Rican service, in view of the
?/Lc.ater. ,en&th Â»f "me during which the
Philippine forces have been actively en
gaged. The changes and improvements
which are about to be made have been
under contemplation for several months
past. According to estimates made the
entire work will cost about $100,000.

Men for Defeating AH At-

KANSAS CITY, May 17.â address to
the Populists' of the country was issued
here to-night by the national organiza
tion of the People's party with the In
dorsement of the National Reform Press
Association. These two bodies, whose
common object" is to keep . the Populist
party in the middle of the road, avoiding
fusion with other political parties every
where, had been In- session here since
Tuesday morning, and the adoption of the
address concluded * their â  labors. *
All was not harmony among these
middle-of-the-road leaders, and only
after long, and heated discussions was an
address agreed upon. A hard fight was
made to secure the indorsement of Whar
ton Barker and Ignatius Donnelly for
President and Vice President in 1900, but
this the committee refused to recom
mend. Instead a thorough organization
of the middle-of-the-roaders in every sec
tion of the. country is urged, with the
understanding that hey shall enter the
next national campaign with the present
Populist organization, but that wherever
fusion shall gain the day. whether in
county, State or nation, the middle-of
the-roaders shall bolt and begin an active
campaign to carry, out their principles.
The alleged fusionist tendencies of
Marion Butler, chairman of the Populist
National Committee, are provided against
in a clause which authorizes the national
organization to call a national conven
tion if it shall be convinced that the Na
tional Chairman or National Committee
are playing Into the hands of the fusion
lsts.
The address of the committee in sub
stance follows: y>v .:.; v:j.:- -
That the voters of the nation may feel as
sured that the People's party shall not again
be betrayed in national convention or Its work
ing forces passed into the hands of the enemy
and to inspire confidence among the masses in
the integrity of our acts and sincerity of our
demands for independent action as a party, we
respectfully submit to the Populists of the
nation the following plan of action:
Firstâ That the national organization com
mittee hereby Instruct its chairman to pro
ceed with the formation of People's party pre
cinct clubs in all the States, on the plan rec2
ommended by the Cincinnati convention of
September, IS9S, or some relative plan, and to
appoint in each State not having members al
ready selected three members of the national
organization committee and with the assist
ance and advice of these committeemen to se
lect a State organization committee of the
same number of members as the then existing
State committee, and through these commit
teemen to organize as far as possible organi
zation committees In Congressional districts.
counties and voting precincts. Wherever It is
positively known that those members of na

they are to be selected as members of the sev

QUEEN VICTORIA
NOT LOSING SIGHT
Sensational RumorsUn-
founded.
â â
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1839, by James Gor-
don Bennett. _
LONDON, May 17.â further denial of
the unfounded story to the effect that
Queen Victoria had lost the sight of her
left eye and that her right eye was nearly
obscured by a cataract were necessary it
was to be found in her Majesty's cheerful
appearance and keen enjoyment at the i
sight of the great crowd which lined the
way between Buckingham Palace and
the Victoria and Albert Museum to-day. j
The Queen rode in an open carriage and
was not protected from the sun by. a
parasol,- and did not wear any glasses,
colored or otherwise, until the ceremonies
of laying of the cornerstone began.
I have been informed on the best au
thority that the Queen's eyesight Is as
good as could be expected in a woman |
of her age, and it has not been impaired j
during her visit to Cimlez.
A. correspondent of a London evening pa
per who made Inquiries at Windsor of one '
of her physicians in residence there was
distinctly told that there was no truth In j
the report that the Queen's eyes were se
riously affected.
Queen Victoria laid the foundation
stone of the Victoria and Albert Mu
seum. She drove through the streets,
lined with troops from Buckingham Pal
ace, the royal carriage being escorted by
a detachment of the Life Guards. Her
Majesty was accompanied by several
Princes and Princesses, and other royal
personages met her at the museum, i
where, a raised dais was reserved for j
them. The embassadors, members of the i
Cabinet and leading state officials were at
the pavilion. An enormous number of
people had gathered along the route when
the Queen started from the palace at 4:15
p.' m. The houses were decorated and
there were strings of flags across tho
roads. The sun shone brilliantly.
A gayly dressed assemblage witnessed
the. ceremony, which the Queen per
formed without leaving her carriage and
amid much enthusiasm.
The ceremonies resembled a miniature
jubilee. American flags were'conspicu
ous among the decorations. Inside the
museum tbe scene recalled the spectacle
at St. Paul's Cathedral upon the occasion
of the Jubilee. . ! - ::.;-â¢.'>
The Marquis of Salisbury, Lord Rose
bery, all the Cabinet Ministers and the
diplomatic corps were present, nearly all
of them wearing brilliant uniforms. The
arrival of the Ministers in splendid equlp
pages, with footmen, was very pictur- j
esque. United States Embassador Joseph
H. Choate and Mrs. Choate drove up in
a plain carriage, Mr. Choate wearing a
dress suit, In remarkable contrast to the
uniforms of the other diplomats. Mr.
and Mrs. Choate were given a prominent
place on the platform, and while await
ing the arrival of the Queen, the Premier,
the First Lord of .the Admiralty, "George
J. Goschen, and others chatted with

NEGRO ASSASSIN
RESISTS ARREST

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, May 17.â Humphrey
Taylor, a negro suspected of the Rosen
stein murder at Slidell, Md., to-day
shot and killed Police Sergeant Fritz
Passau, wounded Policeman Gow and
kept a posse of half a dozen officers at
bay from the loft of a house for nearly
two hours. Dozens of shots were ex
changed between the officers and the
fugitive, who surrendered only when
preparations were made to burn, the
premises.
Last Saturday morning Louis Rosen
stein and .wife, who kept a
small store at Slidell, were found
insensible, and horribly wounded
in their storeroom. Rosenstein
soon died from his injuries and
the woman is believed to be near death.
Suspicion fell upon . the negro, Hum
phrey Taylor, alias Brown, who had
disappeared. The police to-day located
him in a house near the scene of the
murder. â ' V-; :,'-~:.: : -'
When they entered Taylor opened fire
from the trapdoor In which he had
taken refuge. Sergeant Passau received
tÂ«vc bullets through his chest and Gow
was wounded in the hand. Taylor re
treated to a corner of the loft and the
reserve of the two precincts was
called out to surround the house. Mean
time the shooting had attracted several
thousand persons. The negro was not
dislodged until preparations to burn
the place had been begun.
Surrounded by officers with drawn re
volvers, he was hustled out of the house
to the patrol wagon. The crowd surged
forward with shouts of "Lynch him!
Burn him!" and made a rush for the
prisoner. A rope, was' obtained and the
mob made a desperate effort to place it
around the wretch's neck. The cool
ness of ' the officers ! saved Taylor,
though he was "rather badly disfigured
by blows from the nearest of the crowd.
The feeling against the prisoner con
tinues very strong, and during the
evening over a thousand persons gath
ered at the station where the man is
confined. There were many threats ut
tered and .suggestions made that the
man should be lynched. Finally the
police department increased the force
around the station by the addition of
about thirty officers and succeeded in
restoring quiet.

been fixed as June . 9, j and "George Siler

agers of the club and the managers of
the fighters j rrfet to-day. in William
Brady's office to I discuss the situation.
It was argued that Decoration day is
usually a big sporting day, when there
are many, events of interest scheduled.
and that to have the fight on that day
would ' mean a smaller attendance and
smaller gate receipts.
It was decided finally to postpone the
fight until June 9. The arrangement

NEW YORK, May 17.â The Central
Pacific and Southern Pacific main
: tamed their conspicuous position In the
market to-day, both making net gains
approaching 2 per cent. Rumors that
James Speyer will have an important
announcement to make regarding
Southern Pacific affairs upon his ar
rival here toward the end of the month
were again current, but the street
seemed at sea as to the probable nature
I of these developments.
The story of Vanderbilt control of the
i property, however, . received much at
| tention in high quarters, and the posi
i tion of the people who are the most
; bullish on the stock went far to confirm
this rumor.
Interests more or less identified with
j several Vanderbilt properties are quite
} bullish on Southern and Central Pa
j cific, although they will say nothing
j regarding the reason for their attitude*
It looks very much as though there*
j has been consummated some big South
ern Pacific deal, and it is altogether
I probable that Morgan has been instru
mental in bringing about whatever ar
: rangements have been made. Wall
i street men close to Morgan & Co. are

These instructions follow the receipt of
' newspaper clippings sent by the Minister
! telling of the outrage, but up to the time
' his letter was sent- he had received no
'. confirmatory' advices from John C. Red
! man. United States Consular Agent at
Manaos. It was stated to-day that the
i department had received a cablegram
i announcing that the report was correct,
I but Secretary Hay could not be seen to
verify it. The attention of the Navy De
! partment has been called to the matter.
| If It has been found that the consulate
was assaulted by a mob, the Brazilian
Government will be called upon to make
the usual amends. The authorities treat
the matter lightly, in view of the well-
known friendship of Brazil for this coun-
try.

Representative De Tries, the only
Democrat re-elected to Congress from
California last fall, was in Washington
to-day. Since Congress adjourned he
has been both South and East as well
as on the Pacific Coast. He says that
the Governor of California is going to
appc-int Burns to the vacancy in the
Senate left by the failure of the Legis
lature to elect, and that information
comes from the best source that both
Quay and Burns are to be seated. He i
says that if the plan is carried out pub
lic sentiment will, in his judgment, i
change the complexion of the next Cal
ifornia Legislature, and that after the
meeting o-f the new Legislature Burns |
will be succeeded by a Democrat.
California Democrats, he says, are ;
satisfied with Bryan and expect his re
nomination, with a reaffirmation of the
Chicago platform. He acknowledges, '
however, that there is a very hard fight
centering in New York and extending i
into the South and to some extent into
the middle West against Bryan. The j
plan c-f th( opponents of free silver, he
says, Is not to try to prevent the re- j
affirmation of the money plank in the j
platform, but to give greater promi- '
nence to anti-trust and anti-imperial
ism as issues, ignoring the money ques
tion as far as possible.
De Vries started for California to- '

INDIAN SCHOOL BUILDINGS
RAZED BY A CONFLAGRATION
WADSWORTH, Nev.. May 17.â
An Indian courier came in from
the reservation at Pyramid
Lake to-day, bringing news of
the burning of the Indian school
buildings at that place at 7
o'clock this morning. This fire entails a
severe loss to the Piute children and a
loss of $24,000 to the Government.
The buildings burned included the
two-story frame, known as the "boys'
dormitory, which was about 40x60
feet and connected with the main build
ing on the north. The latter -was a one
story building, also of wood, and cov
ered an area of about 40x100 feet. In
these buildings were the class rooms and
the living and work rooms of the half
dozen teachers and seventy-five Indian
scholars.
The fire originated, it Is supposed, from
a defective flue in the dormitory build
ing. Though i he reservation has a regu
lar fire brigade composed of Indians,
which is drilled regularly for such an
emergency, and which has fairly good ap
pliances for flghtin lire, the flames
gained such headway before the brigade
could get to. work that it was unable to
do anything more than save the resi
de;,,..-, of Major Spriggs, the Indian
Agent: Dr. Harrison, the reservation phy
sician; Mr. Jones, assistant to the agent,
and the chapel, bath house and other
buildings adjoining those destroyed.
The fire drill, through which the schol
ars have been put at regular intervals,
became a serious reality this morning
and probably was the means of saving
a number of lives. Though the hour was
early, most of the regular occupants of
the building were up, but very few of
them were outside of the building when
the alarm was sounded. The children
were promptly formed in line and hur
ried from the building, and there was no
time to spare. Professor D. R. Osborne,
the principal of the school, was in com
mand, and was assisted by his wife. Miss

The Egeria is equipped with the most
modern scientific instruments and for
forty years has been engaged charting
the waters wherever British ships are
wont to navigate. In 1863 she mapped
the Pacific Coast waters for mariners
so effectively that not an alteration lias
been made since. A better vessel could
not have been engaged to find a path
way for one of the most gigantic ma
rine cables ever laid. She is manned

officers have been engaged in survey
work for the past twenty-five years.
ACCUSES HER FORMER
HUSBAND OF ARSON
LOS ANGELES, May 17.â 1n a deposi
tion filed to-day in the office of the Coun
ty Clerk, Mrs. Mary Lord Geiss, the di
vorced wife of Isaac Wilson Lord, the
founder of Lordsburg and formerly a San
Bernardino County Supervisor, and one
of the best known, men in Southern Cali
fornia, swears that her former husband
Is an. ex-convict. . Mrs. Qeiss asserts that
Lord was sent to San Quentin in 1856 or
ISSB under the name of George Wilson.
The deponent says Lord . was sent to
prison for grand larceny.
Mrs. Geiss. says that she suspects her
former husband of complicity In having
caused the fire that destroyed the furni
ture store of Dotter & Bradley, now the
Los Angeles Furniture Company, several
years ago. The deposition is to be used
in the suit of George J. Bowron against
Lord,, in which the plaintiff will try to
recover $3000 which it is alleged Lord ob
tained from Bowron by means of false
representations. This suit is the out
growth of the noted "Rebel George" Al
exander case; Â£ Alexander bunkoed Lord
and Bowron out; of $9000 by a gold brick
swindle. . Bowron supplied $3000 of the
sum Bowron now claims that Lord was
in collusion with Alexander, and that the
pair put up the game to rob Bowron.
Mrs. Geiss further deposes that when
Lord spoke about the fire and the stock
that was burned he said it was valued at
$4000, but he thought there was about $22,
--000 insurance. on it.
Mrs. Geiss . is now a resident of Ba
tavia, 111. Her deposition was taken last
Saturday at the office of H. H. Appel,
Bowron's attorney. Mrs. Geiss left for
her Eastern home the next day.

CLANCY ACCUSED
BY SIX JURORS
Inquest Over the Body
of Welch.
of Welch.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARTINEZ, May 17.â The inquest over
the body of Henry W. Welch, who was
the body of Henry \V. Welch, who was
murdered at Orlnda, brought out a good
deal of conflicting testimony .and as a re
sult two verdictsâ one charging Clancy,
who did the shooting, with murder, and a
minority verdict acquitting him on the
ground of Justifiable homicide. Joseph
Roland, in whose shop the affray oc
curred, was the only eye-witness. He not
only seemed to have had no liking for the
murdered man, but was apparently ani
mated by a desire* to shield Clancy as
much as possible. The consequence was
that his testimony was as times conflict
ing, especially as to the cause of the
shooting and the manner in which it was
done.
The testimony of the autopsy surgeons,
J. T. Breneman and A. P. Mulligan, was
important and conclusive. The autopsy
revealed the course of the bullets and
showed that the shots were - fired at
Welch while his back was turned to
Clancy. All of the bullets entered from
the back, clearly indicating that Welch
was retreating when killed. .
The majority verdict charging Clancy
with murder Was signed by six of the
eight jurors, the minority finding of jus
tifiable homicide receiving but two signa
tures. ':;.; ::

Marriage Law in Peru.

non-Catholic marriages. Parties to such
unions must state their religion and de

witnesses that they have never been bap
tized as Catholics. Parties contracting a

The fire occasioned great excitement
among the Indiana at the fandango vil
lage, located only a short distance from
the school. â¢ Many of them had danced
until daylight, but all hands, even down
to the laziest Piute, joined in the effort
to extinguish the flames and save the
other property. Ft is expected the build
ings will be rebuilt, as soon as the neces
sary "r*d tape" has been filed and acted
upon at Washington. Â ..=
The fandango, with all accompaniments,
still runs, despite the fire. Last Satur
day night the Indian police, with Chief
Captain Dave at their head, raided and
closed two or three gambling places
which had been opened by some visit
ing Indians. The visitors protested 'stren
uously, and in a long pow-wow argued
that their games were no more gambling
than "Xyuque" and poker games or bet
ting on the races and pasebali games.
The Piutei would stand no nonsense and
gave the visitors the choice of closing up
or going to jail. They do not allow
Judges of the Groezinger type on the res
ervation, so the places had to close. As
a matter of fact, the games that the
Piutes would not tolerate were percent
age games, with a profit much less than
that of the ordinary racetrack book, or
the games at the Cafe Royal; the Thalia,
Our House, etc.
ASKS FOR TWO
CAVALRY TROOPS
Merriam's Request Will

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, May 17.â Secretary
Alger has "received the following tele
gram from General Merriam in ex
planation of the situation in the.Coeur
d'Alene country:
WARDNER Idaho, May Adjutant
General, Washington: The Governor of
Idaho has carefully reviewed the situation
hero and deems It necessary to place
troops at Burke and Mullan to avoid dis
order. 1 request two troops of cavalry.
Referring to the press criticisms, I have
made no order. My action is limited
strictly to the support of the State au
thorities. There are 359 prisoners still in
custody under Investigation.
.MERRIAM, Brigadier General.
WASHINGTON. May 17.â War
Department Is satisfied with the dis
patch of General Merriam and the be
lief is expressed that he has only as
sisted the Governor of Idaho, and that
the military will not be used for any
other purpose than that for which it
was sent to the disturbed regions.
The troops of â  cavalry requested by-
General Merriam will be sent from Fort
Meade, S. D., and Fort Robinson, Neb.
Several troops of .the First Cavalry are
stationed at these posts.
WALLACE, Idaho, May 17.â Judge
Mayhew this afternoon denied the ap
plication for a writ of habeas corpus
for the two County Commissioners,
Boyle and Stimson, confined at Ward
ner for complicity in the recent rioting.
In rendering his decision he denied
every material contention of the appli
cants. Their main hope was based on
the contention that a suspension of
habeas corpus was a right of the legis
lative branch of the Government rather
than the executive,, unless delegated by
the former in the same manner as
other laws are passed. Mayhew held
this to be erroneous.
Owners or representatives from all
the leading Canyon Creek and Mullan
mines are here to-day. and will stand
solidly by the State officials. One of
them said: "We furnished those men
work at $3 '50 a day when lead was $2 50
and we were barely paying expenses
Now, when we have a chance for a
good profit; they close us down by their
unlawful acts, and we feel that such
men don't deserve work."
Every mine above here is closed or
will be to-night.
JOINT COMMISSION
SOON TO REASSEMBLE
WASHINGTON, May 17.â As the result
of a conference held at the Foreign Of
fice in London between Lord Salisbury,
Sir Julian Pauncefote and Embassador
Choate, the latter acting under instruc
tions from Secretary Hay.it can now be
predicted that the high joint commission
considering .issues between the United
States and Canada will be reassembled
during the summer or early fall. This
outcome Is not yet positively assured
but Mr. Choate's report of the exchanges
at the Foreign Office certainly convey
great encouragement to the officials here
and warrant the expectation that nego
tiations may again be taken up with some
prospect of reaching agreements between
the two branches of the- commission.

Three Companies of Infantry and a

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 17.â The Washing
:on correspondent of the Herald tele-
graphs: To preserve peace and order
In Alaska and to prevent a conflict be
tween the American and Canadian
miners which may injure the good rela
tions existing between the- United
States and Great Britain, orders were
issued by Secretary Alger to-day under
which three companies of infantry will
be sent immediately to that Territory.
These orders have been given with
the approval of the State. Department,
which has forwarded the proper noti
fication to Great Britain to convince
that Government that the United
States is acting in good faith and pro
poses to maintain peace. They are also
due to the failure of Secretary Hay and
Sir Julian Pauncefote to arrange ' a
modus vivendi, which the authorities
say would have prevented the condi
tion of affairs now reported along the
boundary line.
Reports received by the Interior De
partment from Governor Brady show*
that Canadian miners have no regard
for the temporary boundary line which
has been established, and are constant
ly encroaching on American soil.
American miners are very much
wrought up over the matter, and
threats of vengeance, which may any
day be put into execution, are being
uttered. ,:.;-". Â£
General Merritt has been directed to
send one company of infantry and Gen
eral Merriam two companies, and place
them under the orders of Major Gen
eral Shafter, commanding the Depart
ment of California, which includes
Alaska. The instructions given to Gen
eral Shafter require him to establish a
new post at Pyramid harbor, on Chil
kat Inlet, not far from the boundary
line, the point where danger of a con
flict is greatest. It has also been de
termined to replace two companies of
the Fourteenth Infantry, which were
stationed at Dyea and Fort Wrangel.
These troops have been ordered ;to
proceed to the Philippines for duty.
Dyea is not far from Chilcoot Pass and
only a short distance from the boun
dary line. Battery A of the Third Ar
tillery, which is at Circle City, will be
retained .at that point. With three
companies and Battery A the officials
believe peace and order will be pre
served, but the dispatch of troops will
not stop the efforts of the State De
partment to secure a settlement of the
Alaskan boundary dispute, even be
fore the meeting In August of the
Anglo-Canadian American High Joint
Commission, which will certainly dis
cuss the boundary question should it
still exist.
Senator Fairbanks and former Secre
tary of State Foster, members of the
High Joint Commission, were in con
ference to-day with Secretary Hay re
garding the negotiations which Embas
sador Choate has been conducting in
London with reference to the Alaskan
boundary. Senator Fairbanks will pro
ceed to Alaska to examine conditions
there for himself and expects to return
to Washington the latter part of July
in order to be present at the reas
sembling of the commission.
BOLD OPERATIONS OF
A NEW RELIGIOUS SECT
NEW YORK, May 17.â A Bangor (Me.)
special to the Herald says. A strange re
ligious sect, known as the Disciples of the
Holy Ghost, whoso operations in various
parts of Maine within the past year and
more have caused great excitement among
the weak-minded, have obtained a strong
foothold In the town of Levant, a few
miles west of Bangor, where they had
been holding meetings and making con
verts for several months past.
Ruel Clement, a recent convert,- has
turned over his farm and all its Imple
ments and stock, except swine, to the
leaders of the new sect. . The swine, being
regarded as unclean beasts, have been
slaughtered and their carcasses buried.
The . farmer has now j gone to Durham,
there to work in the co-operative colony,
while his fine farm in Levant is being
managed by a disciple of the new faith
named George Higgins. â¢
Nathaniel McKuslck, another farmer,
was looked upon as a likely convert, but
he backslid. Disciples called the other
day and asked him if he was ready to
give his property to God. He replied that
he could notâ that the farm, was God's
already, and he was merely exercising a
stewardship over it.
At Durham, where the sect has its head
quarters, has been erected on a high hill
a queer-looking building, which they call
the Temple of Shiloh, this being the cen
ter and fountain from which is dispensed
the new doctrine of comfort, happiness
and eternal salvation through faith pure
and simple. J: -.'".' tr
PICQUART REPLIES
TO ACCUSATIONS
NEW YORK. May 17.â A cable to the
Sun from Paris says: The Figaro this
morning publishes a memorial which Col
onel Picquart sent yesterday to the Court
of Cassation. He points out that four
heads of the charges under which he is
a prisoner are: Communicating to Le
Blois the information drawn from the
Esterhazy dossier, communicating infor
mation drawn from the Dreyfus dossier,
forgery and using forgery.
Replying to the first accusation, which
Siben fully developed on August 24, 1898,
alleging that Picquart was not attacked
when he communicated to Le Blois in
June, 1897, information from the Ester
hazy dossier, Picquart points out that the
machinations against him began in Au
gust, 1896, the date when it was discov
ered that the bordereau was written by
Esterhazy, and that the secret dossier did
not aoply to Dreyfus when Picquart com
municated his discovery to his superiors.
He gives Incidents of the machinations,
pointing out Colonel Henry's duplicity in
writing friendly letters to him while con
spiring against '.. him. When Henry was
unmasked he retorted with, a menacing
letter, written in complicity with Gen
erals Boisdeffre and Gonz, in which he
threatened to turn Picquart's discoveries
regarding Esterhazy â  against himself.
Picquart, seeing that < strong Influences
were working for his destruction, con
veyed to Le Blois the minimum of infor
mation necessary for his defense.

Four Choices- First.
The gate receipts at Oakland track for
the remaining three racing days of the
week will be contributed to charity by the
exiled Pacific Coast Jockey Club. Season
badges will not be honored. Most of the
money thus' obtained will be used to beau-
tify the boulevards leading to Ingleside
track. This is certainly a most worthy
object, and the blind, lame and Infirm
ought to turn out in large numbers. If
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club desires to
spread this money about where it will
do the most good, why, don't let it leave
the track. There are dozens of horsemen
that do not know which way to turn for
want of a dollar. For months they have
been looking despair in the face, while
race after race has been put on the pro-
gramme for Corrigan and his favored bar-
nacles. And this is the game the Califor
nia public has been asked to support.
These parasites from the Middle West can
race their horses "in and out" and noth-
ing is said. But if a California owner
"blinks his eye" he Is ordered to pack his
traps and emigrate. Charity begins at
home, and the racing association should
assist their own needy before trying to
convert the savages.
The racing yesterday had a sweet Cor-
riganesque flavor to it. Chicago grew
tired of Corrigan, so the master of Haw-
thorne immigrated to this side of the
Rockies, and has been quoted as saying
"that he liked our climate." Why
shouldn't he? During the last two weeks.
of racing his horses have won $3750. Many
of the races were "set-ups," and he bet'
liberally on them. The Derby was post
poned to give his Corsine time to recu
perate, the judges disqualified Pat Mor-
rissey one day that he might cash on
Adolph Spreckels, and several other inci
dents have happened on the quiet to make
his stay pleasant.
Yesterday Alarla and Adolph Spreckels
were returned winners, while Potente,
favorite for the handicap, struck a
snag. This latter was an unlooked for
occurrence. . In all four favorites were
successful.
The sport began with a five-furlong
scramble for two-year-olds, Giga going
to the post favorite. Jenkins bad the
mount on the Foul Shot filly and catching
St. Casimir in the sail home, won driving

from the Corrigan entry by half a length. i
The Scot finished third. â¢
A poor start, added to a weak ride on
the part of Jenkins, contributed to the
defeat of the favorite Recreation in the
mile selling run, next decided. Ine Burns
& Waterhouse mare was plunged on, but
Caldwell released the barrier with the
first choice turned sideways. She made
a superb run, and when looking to have
the race in hand, Jenkins drew his whip
and losing half a length was beaten a
head by Alaria, the second choice. â .â ;-'â â¢'â -.-â â 
Dan Hanlon started Sly in the six-
furlong sprint, and ruling a hot favorite
she landed first by a nose, after a -dcs-
perate duel with Horatio, against which
12 to 1 was laid. Highland Ball was
third. "V. .â 
The second mile selling was captured
by Jennie Reid. The mare ruled equal
choice with Imperious and The Fretter,
and downed Nilgar half a length.
The mile and a furlong "special" was
truly funny. There were three entries
and Corrigan bet a chunk on his entry,
Adolph Spreckels. It was a grand con-
test and should have received more ad-
vertising. Spreckels won in a walk. Rosl-
nante led Daisy F out for the place.
The Corrigan crowd said Potente would
not do for the mile and a sixteenth handi-
cap, but the gelding was a heavily played
favorite nevertheless. Any close observer
could see that the horse was a "lobster"
in Tuesday's six-furlong dash. He made
a bold bid for it. but was beaten In a
drive by Malay with Ward up.
Track Notes.
The fast sprinter Pelxotto died at Oakland
track yesterday from an attack of colic.
Secretary Nathanson of Harlem track, Chi
cago, wires that the betting ring is open to
all bookmakers who wish to cut in. The syndi
cate style of gambling was not a success.
Two or three bookmakers had their fingers
scorched handling Malay money. The horse was
handed about as a "dead one," but some one
registered a kick with the judges, which was
not without cheering results. Jack Ward had
the mount. = > r i

cellor is violating the ancient maxim of
equity that none shall come tlferein unless
with pure motives and pure issues upon
which a controversy may be determined.
When the case of Newhouse against
Wiltsee. in which the plaintiff prays the
Chancellor to adjudge that he is a partner
with Wiltsee in the Providence mine, was
called yesterday afternoon the case of the
defendant proceeded. In his introduction
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler made an ef
fort to introduce testimony of, witnesses
to. the effect that Newhouse was but an
agent of Wiltsee and that as such agent
he had violated the confidence of his em
ployer and was getting a commission.
which came directly from Wilts.- 's
pocket, on all mining machinery, imple
ments, provisions and paraphernalia pur
chased by him as such agent for the
development of such mine. It was claimed
that powder was sold at. an advance to
Wiltsee, that Newhouse got a "knock
down" on drug bills and so on, the prac
tice being one. as Attorney Wheeler put
it, "of petty thieving and dishonest pil
fering." A long legal argument followed
on the relevancy of the testimony, but
finally Judge Seawell sustained an objec
tion of Garret McEnerney, who represents
Newhouse.
Mr. Wheeler contended that the matter
of "unclean hands" was one for the deter
mination of the Chancellor and that tes
timony showing that Newheuse had come
into court in the condition prohibited by
a court of equity should be admitted. In
any event. Judge Seawell sustained the
objection without prejudice, and the mat
ter will be further argued this morning.
During the course of the proceedings it
fell to Mr. McEnerney to make a counter
charge of unclean hands against Wiltsee.
Mr. McEnerney said that Wiltsee had
admitted his culpability under the maxim
on the witness stand under these circum
stances: Wiltsee and Lord Sudeley were
partners in the Drummond mine, a prop
erty in which Newhouse claims no In
terest. Wiltsee employed Newhouse to
visit the mine and perform some services,
after which the principals in the present
litigation met. Wiltsee told Newhouse
that he should certainly be paid for his
labors on the Drummond mine; "but you

The remarkable feature of the baseball

Oakland over Watsonvllle, they thereby
jumping from fourth to second place and

former position. San Francisco, by
breaking even with Santa Cruz, retains
the lead, though with a somewhat re

in third position, while San Jose and Sac
ramento have increased their percentage.
somewhat, but have not improved their
positions. However, all the clubs are
fairly well bunched and the next series
may topple over the leaders and boost
some of the taiienoers up nearer the top.

By signing Johnson for first and Pee
ples for second Manager Ewing has given
Oakland a ball team second to none in
the league in fielding; whether it can bat
with San Francisco, this week's series
will decide. The two teams come to
gether for three games at Recreation
Park Saturday and Sunday, and they will
without a doubt prove the most inter
esting played ere so far this season.
Oakland Is only one game behind the
leaders and the old animosity between the
two clubs is again in evidence. The lo
cals appear to have a shade the best of
it in the pitching department, and are de
cidedly stronger in hitting, while in field
ing from catcher to outfield md in base
running as well, the Athenians have the
better of the argument. Which game
wins â hitting or fieldingâ this week
ought to decide to the satisfaction of all
the cranks, and both have stanch advo
cates.
The league officials are having a uni-
ifficials are having a uni-
form made of boiler-plate. especially
constructed, for the se of umpires who
I are assigned to Santa Cruz. At the sea
beach last Sunday O'Connell had to be es
corted to the train by the players of both
teams and the police to escape the ven
geance of the fanatics, and all he did was
to call the game at an hour agreed upon
by the taptains of the two teams, in or
der to allow the Friscos to catch the
evening train home. Intense excitement
Drevalled throughout the game.
I After two weeks' experience as a base-
ill magnate, the iceman dumped his
ad around Gilbert's pedal extremities
id the San Josean retired from the
*me. A company ;s being formed to
;ke the team and Chief Borchera will be
yen entire management of it. He has
ready mad" some i.ceded changes and
ill soon have the team up among the
aders. For a starter, the chief has about
oncluded negotiations with Leake, the
una Clara College shortstop, who, Man-
re'r Harris says- having seen him play
one of the greatest nftelders in the
tate and bids fair to rival any in the
try. Professor Graham of the same
stitution. another strong fielder and
itter. has also been signed. ODea
as begun practice and will go into the
imes this week, while Kleiber has been
'based owing to his lack of condition.
he newly constructed In field will corn-
rise Hanlon; first: Anderson, second;
'Pea. third, and Leake, short, while the
jtfielders will be Dairymple. McGucken
nd Graham. These, with Kent behind
thÂ»- bat and Bor< hers and Andrews in the
ox, give San Jose as strong a team as
Â»n be figured out on paper.
Aft' negotiating with Manager Kripp
for some days. "Doc ' Henesey decided
ot to go into the game again, and now
the Sacramento people are fer ring with
Ed Hutchinson, the giant ex-Senator,
and hope to have him on first base this
week. Hutchinson is in Sacramento now
and is in condition to play ball to-day. He
is considered by many Henesey- equal,
and will help the Senators out wonder
fully. Kripp is also negotiating with the
San Jose management relative to the
Truck Egan matter. With the new men
they have signed San Jose will have no
use for Egan and will probably release
him to Krlpp. If this deal is completed
Kripp can play marbles while the other
fellows are sawing wood; his guessing
match will be about over.
Notwithstanding his three defeats of
last week, Manager Struve is not fretting
over his Watsonvllle, hayseeds to any
extent. In two games his team
played ragged hall, to he sure, hut in the
third, when everybody was beginning to
think there was no baseball in them, they
put up a game that made one quiver with
excitement. Watsonvllle is all right and
doesn't need any new material at present.
The injury to Arrelanes. which will
probably keep him out of the game for
the remainder of the season, has seri
ously crippled the Santa Cruz Infield, but
Manager Tuttle is making strenuous ef
forts to secure a competent man in his
place.
Roscoe Coughlin, Danny Sweeney and
J. Peck Sharpe, all old California
leaguers, are anxious to come out here
again.

THE STREET DEPARTMENT MEN
MUST BE SILENT.
The Practice of Blackmailing Men
on the City's Pay Roll Is
Said to Be a Common
One.
Publication of the facts concerning the â¢
proposed investigation by the Board of I ;
Supervisors into the affairs of the office ,
of Superintendent of Streets Fragley has â  ,
caused no end of a commotion among the ]
employes at the City Hall. All of the
attaches of the office over which Mr. ,
Fragley has control have been supenaed ;
to appear before a committee of the '
Board of Supervisors on Friday, at which
time they will be questioned as to their
knowledge of the charges that Mr. Frag- .
ley requires them to pay him a portion
of their monthly or daily salary, refusal
to make such payment being considered
sufficient cause for their dismissal from
the employ of the city. . . .
To several officials who called on him
yesterday, Mr. Fragley denied that the
charge made against him is founded on
fact and intimated that he would make
It extremely warm for such members of
the Board of Supervisors as he considered
responsible for the proposed investiga
tion. He even intimated that the charge
made against him might be made with
truth against any one of half a dozen
members of the board. In this connection |
he declared his intention of making a I
few disclosures in the event that he is
called upon to testify before the board.
It is well known to the initiated that .
at least three-quarters of the employes of
the different departments of the city
government retain their position by pay- j
ing a portion of their salaries to those
persons who secured them the positions I
or to others who are responsible for the â 
continuance of their employment. For
this reason a majority of the men on
the city's pay roll are now on the anxious :
seat because of the fear that the investi
gation that is to begin with the Superin

STADER'S HOME BURNED.
A Defective Chimney Destroys Two
Houses on Wilder Street.
The fire alarm from box 571 (Chenery
and Diamond) at 12:45 p. m. yesterday
was for a fire at the residence of Chris
Stader. president of the "West of Castro
Street Improvement Club, at 29 Wilder
street. In consequence of the high wind
that blew in through the creek ravine
of Glen Park, together with the distance
from the nearest engine-house, the home
of Stader was totally destroyed. The ad
joining house, which was owned by him,
but occupied as a residence by John
Hermann, was partly burned. To add to
the other misfortunes attending the lire
there was a scarcity of water in the
neighborhood, and it was with difficulty
that the firemen were enabled to fori
It to the desired object.
The buildings were insured ' for $1400.

Peckerman Wanted to Take Out a
Peckerman Wanted to Take Out a
Diamond Ring for a Friend, but Re-
used to Pay the Customary
Rate of Interest.
A rather lively row occurred yesterday i
; afternoon in the pawnshop at 19 Third !
j street, recently conducted by Simon Peck- |
erman. Peckerman's son "Benny" was bad- I
ly damaged by Eugene Eber. a young man j
who. is employed at the pawnshop. The i
elder Peckerman has conducted the pawn-
shop for many years, but last week he
failed, and those who know the inside of
the old man's affairs declare that his
business and fortune were ruined by the j
.waywardness. of his two sons, Joseph and ;
Benny, both of â whom are well known on !
the coast.
Yesterday afternoon Benny Peckerman
entered the store and handed the clerk a
ticket for a diamond ring, which he
wanted to redeem at 2 per cent interest.
The regular rate is 6 per cent, and Eber
WILL LEAD
flatly refused to allow Peckerman to re
deem the ring unless he paid the cus
tomary rate of interest.
"This ring belongs to a particular friend
of mine," shouted Peckerman.
"I don't care who it belongs to. If you
want to take it out you'll have to pay
the customary rate of interest," retorted
Eber hotly.
Then Peckerman attempted to strike
Eber. The blow slipped around the clerk's
neck and the two clinched. For a min
ute or two they furnished some real good
hand-to-hand fighting. 'hairs were
knocked over, tables were upturned and
several layers of rings were scattered on
the floor. .
When the police entered to separate the
pair Eber had Benny's red head under his
ferm and was pounding It severely. Young
Peckerman was game, however, and as
two husky policemen led him out of the
store he struggled hard to get free so he
could resume the. scrap.

Boyd . denies such an amount is due. but
In his pleadings practically acknowledges
that the profits amount to the sum
; stated: but he claims the entire amount
i for his services on behalf of Davis' in-

day show that just prior to Davis' death
he had $1,059,187 64 Invested in the firm,

vested, showing an overdraft on his part

Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the
Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the
Sailors' Union of the Pacific, and Edward
Rosenberg, secretary of the Labor Coun
cil and business manager of the Coast
Seamen's Journal, filed an affidavit last
night with Chief of Police Lees, charging
Sergeant Stephen Bunner of the harbor
police with unofficorlike conduct. The
charge may cause Sergeant Bunner to
lose his star.
The affidavit recites that on May 12 in
formation was received by the union that
some sailors wanted to leave the schooner
Ellen> A, then lying off Meiggs wharf.
Accordingly a committee composed of
three members of the unionâ Pear
son, A. Ekman and M. Crowellâ out
in a small boat to inquire into the matter.
While they were parleying with the
mate Sergeant Bunner came alongside in
the police boat. According to tne affi
davits filed, Bunner wanted to know what
the trouble was. Upon being informed,
he asked the mate if the three men were
wanted on board. The mate said they
were not and Bunner, it is alleged, began
to abuse them in forcible terms. It is
charged he told the mate to throw them
overboard and shoot a hole' through their
boat it they did not leave in a hurry.
Upon Pearson remonstrating with him, it
is stated, Bunner threatened "to smash
his face in" and to do other bodily harm.
The men thereupon got back in the boat
and pulled away.
In discussing the affair last night Mr.
Furuseth said: "We at first intended to
present the affidavit to the Police Com
missioners, but as they did not meet last
night we filed it with Chief Lees, be
lieving that would do as well. We were
soon undeceived, however, for Chief Lees
gave us scant satisfaction. He very un
willingly received the affidavit and ad-"
vised us to take the matter to the courts.
He said we had no business to bring it
to him or the Commissioners. He seemed
to think a sailor has no right to quit a
vessel whan he wants to. However, we
will prepare a new affidavit and present
it to the Commissioners at their next
meeting, and they may listen to our com
plaint." *'' -;â¢; :y-; *

When He Arrives at Manila.
Will 'Leave Monday on

Brigadier General Frederick D. Grant
arrived last night from San Juan, Porto
Rico, en route to Manila, where he will
report to General Otis for duty.
General Grant went immediately upon
, his arrival to the Palace Hotel, where he
was greeted by his brothers, Ulysses S.
I Grant Jr. and Jesse R. Grant, who ar
j rived on the "Owl" yesterday morning
j from San Diego. He has been- travelingl
! almost continuously since the 20th of last
j month, when he left San Juan for Wash
i ington, and will spend the short time he
' has before the sailing of the transport
â  Sherman, to which be is assigned for pas
; sage to the Philippines, in absolute rest.
The general spoke interestingly of his
experience at Porto Rico, where for many
months he was in comand of the Ameri
can troops, and had charge of the re
habilitation of the governmental func
tions of the island. Concerning the peo
ple among whom he has spent so much
of his time he said:
"The Porto Ricans are an amiable, al
though somewhat excitable people and
will, I think, make good citizens after
they have had a -year or so of schooling
under our Government. They have lived
for years, of course, under Spanish rule
and Spanish customs, but they are quick
to adapt themselves to new conditions
and are taking kindly to American cus
toms.
"So far as they have experienced Amer
ican rule, however, 1 think they are
slightly disappoined. They welcomed us
as deliverers at first and were led to ex
pect radical and immediate reforms and
the reforms have evidently not come
quick enough for them. Because of the
war they neglected their crops and their
business interests generally, and- having
to pay two duties on what they were
prepared to ship out the price oh their
products was reduced to a figure lower
than that they received from Spain.
"They were In a good frame of mind to
be disappointed and they certainly are,
though they make no open demonstration
of it, and I think will be as good natured
as ever after the magnitude of proposed
American reforms become apparent to
them.
"Although we had a great deal of sick
ness among our troops, we found the cli
mate one that our people could adapt
themselves to quite readily. The country
is productive of profitable crops and a
couple of years of American rule will
make it as good a state as most of those
in the Union."
General Grant entered the army as col
onel, commanding the Fourteenth Volun
; teer Infantry of New York. He took his
regiment to Chickamauga and was com
missioned brigadier general and placed
; in command of the first division of the
Third Army Corps. With his command
he was ordered to San Juan on July 27,
i find since that time has conducted affairs
on the island. .-.-.
The Sherman will leave about the 22d
of the present month, and the general
expects to be attached to General Law
ton's command upon his arrival on the
1 other side.

A NATIONAL LABEL LAW.
O CCORDING to the testimony of experts be-
ACCORDING to States Senate of Pure Food
fore the United States Senate Pure Food
Commission, there is hardly an article of food
that is not made the subject of some form of decep
tion upon consumers. Dr. H. W. Wiley, chief of the
division of chemistry in the Agricultural Department,
is reported to have informed the commission, "Prac
tically everything we eat or drink is/ adulterated."
Other witnesses gave testimony that substantially con
firmed the statement.
It is conceded that while many of these adultera
tions are harmful and even dangerous to health and
life, a considerable number are not. There is also an
intermediate class, said to be harmless by the
adulterators who make use of them, but regarded as
harmful by physicians. Salicylic acid is one of this
class, as the adulterators claim it is used in such small
quantities it cannot possibly injure any one. while
the weight of medical authority is adverse to the
claim, the experience of the profession being that
when used to adulterate any article of common use
so that the consumer uses it habitually even in small
quantities, the consequences are pernicious in the ex
treme.
One of the salient features of the evidence sub
mitted to the commission is that while European
Governments forbid the sale of adulterated foods
within their own territory, they do not forbid the
manufacture of such goods for export. The result
is the United States are made a dumping ground for
all kinds of European concoctions as well as those
made at home. The evil has become one of por
tentous magnitude, and it is full time some efficient
remedy were provided for it. It is the design of the
Senate Commission to recommend the passage of
some law to that effect, and the subject is now being
discussed extensively by the Eastern press.
The prevailing tone of our Eastern exchanges, we
regret to say. is not sanguine. As the Philadelphia
Record expresses it: '.'Whether the Federal legisla
tive authority could be induced to undertake seriously
the task of reforming the evil practices of the legion
of food adulterators is open to question, since the
public interest counts for but little in Congress when
weighed against the influences exerted by a powerful
lobby. But if there be any desire to legislate for the
interests of the consumer it should be easy to demon
strated the lawmakers the fairness and justice of a
law which would enable buyers of articles of food to
know exactly what they were paying for. A truthful
label on an adulterated article would infallibly drive
it from the market in due time, no matter how
'cheap' it might be."
There can be little doubt of the essential soundness
of that view of the case. A law requiring all articles
to be correctly labeled as to their nature and the
place and time of manufacture would injure â¢ no
honest industry. Such a law is so fair to all that it
would seem impossible for even the most powerful
lobby to defeat it if a strong public demand should
be made for it.
Russell Sage agrees. with C. P. Huntington that
the education of the young in this country is too gen
eral. Both of the fox-like financiers want the young
men. of America to leave their books for "practical"
life. Is it possible that the old gentlemen wish to
educate American boys down to their standards of
business and professional ethics? One Sage in a
generation is enough. One Huntington is more than
enough.
That some people in England have objected to
Choate's declaration that Dewey is as great as Nel
son is not surprising. In this country there would be
some objection if an English orator should as
sert Nelson to be as great as Dewey. In the game
of favorites each nation is entitled to its own.
To save the fruit industry, from the domination of

A MONUMENT FOR DEWEY.
A MOVEMENT has been started the. East to
provide Admiral Dewey with a stately, mansion
house and home at the national capital. It is
right that this should be so. The nation owes much
to the Admiral, and since our laws do not admit the
large rewards which monarchical Governments, and
notably that of Great Britain, give to great men, it
is but proper a grateful and a generous people should
undertake the duty themselves and by free gift pro
vide the hero with a home worthy of his dignity and
his honors. Â
Admiral Dewey, however, merits more than a
home. His service should be commemorated by
something of a monumental character which will
stand for ages and perpetuate the memory of the
gratitude and admiration which his fellow citizens of
this generation feel toward him. There is no reason
why the Admiral should not receive a monument for
his fame as well as a home for his family. He. has
merited both, and the wealth and the liberality of the
American people are equal to the patriotic task of
providing both.
The home of the Admiral is to be in the East, his
noblest monument should be in the West. His man-
sion is to be in Washington, let his memorial statue
stand in San Francisco. The people of, the Eastern

tract. If we keep the islands and give them a semi-
nnlitary administration to hold the people in subjec
tion, the order enforced by the sword' will be taken
advantage of by capitalists to import and use coolie
labor under penal contract. The American army will
be handy to coerce labor and compel the Asiatic
slaves to perform their contracts. At this moment
we see the army being used at home to compeT em-
ployers to accept certain .conditions, and to forbid
labor the right to earn wages unless under certificate
from the commanding officer!

The tropics offer no shelter, nor prosperity, nor
health, nor length of days, to the American home-
seeker. It is said that these new possessions will
serve to drain off the increasing class of the, discon-
tented among us. There is never discontent without
a cause. Deporting those who suffer from that
cause does not remove it, but rather tends to its in-
crease. A small part of the hundreds of millions
spent in tropical exploitation already, if devoted to
home concerns, would have left no American sus
ceptible to the lure of home-seeking in the tropics.
JUDICIAL LEGISLATION.
r V
THE body of the common law, though in theory
I derived from immemorial custom, is in reality
chiefly of judicial creation. The English
Judges, accepting certain principles, rules and maxims
as fundamental, extended their application from cen
tury to century, so that in effect they exercised legis
lative authority. 'They have always charged juries on
matters of fact, which has given them a vast influence
in the determination of practical issues. Under ..the
arbitrary rule of the Stuarts, when the Star Chamber
was in existence, the last batch of corrupt and arbi
trary Judges known in English history dictated ver
dicts and held life and liberty almost completely at
their mercy.
Judge-made law, however irregular in its origin,
accomplished beneficent results under the great Lord
Mansfield, who drew from all available sources, in
cluding the civil law, of which English Judges had
been profoundly jealous, and adapted and expanded
commercial jurisprudence to the necessities of modern
times.
But when the Government of the United States j
was established, the wise statesmen and patriots of j
our country, appreciating the terrible danger to free {
institutions in the centralization of power and in the I
blending of two dissimilar functions in the judiciary, j
in the first place accurately defined the limitations on I
Federal authority, by holding it within an express |
grant and essential implications, and, in the second
place, as a fundamental proposition, organized three
separate governmental departments, each distinct from \
the others, while all were connected by the indis- j
soluble bond of the Union. Thus it happens that j
from 1787 to the present time, in theory and until late i
years substantially in practice, the jurisdiction and
procedure in the Federal courts have been rigidly
confined within the text of enabling statutes and such I
implied powers as were indispensable to the effectual i
administration of justice within those carefully de- i
fined limits. The constitutional amendments result- ;
ing from the Civil War, justly designed to insure per- j
j sonal liberty and the protection of property, greatly
I increased the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, j
They have always exercised the anomalous right of ;
expounding evidence before juries, which has oper- i
I ated to insure or defeat justice according to the in- '
1 dividual training, opinions and practice of the incum
' bents of the Federal bench. The people, however.
1 have been so jealous of judicial encroachments; the
j tendency to which is natural and marked, that the
j State constitutions, almost if not quite unanimously,
j have distinctly prohibited that kind of interference
with jury trials.
The gradual enlargement of the powers of the Fed-
eral judiciary and its increasing exercise of legisla
tive functions of late years has been facilitated by
Congressional enactments that favor s concentrated
and aggressive wealth, at the expense of the rooted
principles .of American institutions. No more for-
midable or dangerous example of this tendency could
be found than part of the decision' of Judge McKenna
jin the grain rate case, as interpreted by Railroad I
! Commissioner Blackstock in his report, ultimately
[ perfected with the assistance of William F. Herrin.
The enormous -advantage to be derived by the rail-
road and by other oppressive monopolies from the
views thus disseminated can be readily perceived from
a 1 short extract: "While the commission has a con-
stitutional and statutory authority to regulate and
fix freights and fares, yet the same must be just and
reasonable, and the question as to whether or not they
are just and reasonable may be investigated and de-
termined by a court of competent jurisdiction"â that
is, by a Federal tribunal. It will be observed that the
law here declared is not that the court, may decide
whether a State commission has exercised some intelli
: gence and some discretion In the adjustment of rates,
; but whether the' rates as' established are "just and
reasonable." The ultimate right, therefore, to deter- !
j mine the main fact within the conceded jurisdiction of
; the commission is claimed to have been transferred to ; :
the Circuit Court of the United States. This means j
I that a Federal Judge can exercise the identical func- j
I tions of a railroad commission, and if his judgment I
approve the schedule, then it will stand, but other-
wise it will be set aside.
It is doubtful whether, in the exact case to which
we have adverted, on a final hearing the Circuit Court !
or the Supreme Court of the United States would !
justify this wholesale appropriation of/authority. But j
the tendency, somewhat weaker now than three or |
! four years ago, is unquestionably in that direction j
) and should be corrected by wise Congressional legis- j
j lation, equally just to corporations and to the people, I
i and equally restraining the illegal dominancy of par- j
j ticular classes of monoplies and the anarchical ele- \
i ment that has apparently taken possession of the !
j Democratic party. In the State courts, in reference
to mutual benefit and benevolent societies, recent de
cisions. have almost made them independent of the es
tablished tribunals of the country, and there are Fed-
eral decisions somewhat on the same line, indicating
that great jurists have at least scented the danger we
have pointed out.. But the possibility of an "unnatural
commingling of judicial , and .legislative. \ functions
should be averted by clear and definite statutes, leav
ing, no room for misconstruction: There can be no
more vital necessity- for the safety of the republic
than firm adherence to the original distribution Â» of
powers between the three departments â of govern-
ment. , Â:.,,, , >,-â¢â  *.
The only satisfactory explanation of the objection
of Huntington and Russell Sage to liberal education
is to be found in the fact that neither of them has
ever been either liberal or educated.
The Rev. Dr. Charles A. Briggs is at last an or
dained Episcopal minister. Perhaps his friends will
now permit him to mind his own business. " ' ""
ELMHURST'S NEW DIVINE
Rev. Edward E. Clark, Who Has Accepted a Call
From the First Presbyterian Church.
REV. EDWARD E. CLARK, the well-known divine, has accepted a
call from the Presbyterian church at Elmhurst.
Dr. Clark was born in West Virginia, near Steubenville, Ohio. He
has a twin brother, also a Presbyterian pastor in Southwestern Penn
sylvania. He was a graduate of the Steubenville High School of Ohio. He
was also an honor man in the class of 1883 from Marietta College and from
the Lane Theological Seminary, Cincinnati,', class of 1886.
Dr". Clark's first pastorate was at Cambridge City, Ind. He has been
eleven years in California, having had charge of Presbyterian churches in
Berkeley. Salinas, Monterey and' Fruitvale. His predecessor at Elmhurst
church .was Rev. R. C. Stone, now pastor of the Centennial Presbyterian
Church, East Oakland.
A SAN FRANCISCAN RUNS
THE LAGUNA DE BAI
Sergeant Henry F. Jurs, Chief Engineer of the
Famous Tin-Clad Gunboat.
ONE of the men from San Francisco who has distinguished himself at
the Philippines In the war with the Insurgents Is Henry F. Jurs, who
enlisted in the war with Spain from the signal corps of the -Second
Brigade of the National Guard of California and entered the service
as a member of Company Aof the Volunteer Signal Corps. The particular
line in which he became prominent was cheif engineer, of the armored United
States gunboat Laguna de Bai, the vessel which has become famous as the
one that cleared the Pasig River as far as the lake. .
Jurs, who, in recognition of his valuable services, was . appointed to be
first-class sergeant, the highest non-commissioned. position: he could reach,
at the time of his enlistment, lived with his parents at IS Johnstone avenue.
He is a native of this city, 26 years of age, and . was employe/! at the Union
Iron Works, where he served m various departments to become a. mechani
cal engineer. At the works he was held in high esteem, on account of his
proficiency in every branch in which he served. aifeHBBgSBBBi
At the suggestion of a man named Mead, sent from the Union Iron
Works to put captured Spanish vessels in condition for the use of the forces
at Manila,^Sergeant Jurs was selected to assist him in armoring the Laguna
de Bai and to put her engines in serviceable condition, being detailed from
his command for that purpose. After the vessel had been put in fighting
trim, Filipino and other engineers were placed in charge of the engine room.
but five who were tried could not make the vessel come up to the standard
that was required. Then- by order of General Otis Sergeant Jurs was de
tailed as chief engineer. B&6*aÃ
How well he succeeded has been told in the various dispatches that
have been published in The Call about the extraordinary cruise of the lit
tle iron-covered steamer that so terrified the natives who were within gun-
shot of her.. A tribute to. his -worth In the position he occupies -was paid him
by Captain Grant,, the commander of the vessel, who, on introducing him
to the first lieutenant of the, Utah Battery, said: "This- Is Sergeant: Jurs
the young -man who is our chief engineer, and who has made our gunboat
successful when everybody else tailed. I shall do what I can to secure a
commission for him," for he deserves it, if anybody ever did."*
TRANSPORTATION FOR RETURNING SOLDIERS.
; To the Editor of The Call: You .were kind enough to publish a communica
tion from me some time ago upon the injustice of compelling the marines and blue
jackets coming home on the transport Buffalo to pay their own fares overland to
their respective places of abode and enlistment.
. I have reason to knotf that the department at Washington 'took cognizance of
that very same published complaint and acted upon it immediately. The paper
containing the article was taken by a personal friend, to the proper authority and
the result was announced in the dispatches three days later that all of them
would be furnished transportation to their various homes. This saves my son
and many others the payment of railroad fare across the continent to this city,
where they enlisted. .
They all owe many thanks. to The Call for its kindness and great* influence.
Yours truly, JAMES W. COLLINS,
San Francisco, May 13, 1899. 54 Sixth street.

THE GAS COMPANYâ C. 0.. and
A. S., City. On the subject of a gas
company furnishing gas to applicants the
Civil Code of California, section 629, says:
Upon application in writing of the owner or
occupant of any building or premises distant
not more than one hundred feet from any main
of the corporation and payment by the appli
cant of all money due from him to
the coropration, the corporation must
supply gas for such building or prem
ises and cannot, refuse on the ground of
any Indebtedness of any' former owner or
occupant thereof, unless the applicant has un
dertaken to pay the same. If. for the space of
ten days after such application; the corpora
tion refuses or neglects to supply the -gas, it
must pay to the applicant the sum of $50 in
liquidated damages, and $5 a day for every day
such refusal or neglect continues thereafter.
It has been decided that a gas company can
not, under the law, demand a deposit from a.
consumer or one who applies to consume gasi-

Undertaking for This
Government.
When the Moana sailed for Australia
yesterday by way of Samoa she took with
her the headquarters' staff of the Pago
Pago baling station expedition. The con
tractors. Healy. Tibbits & Co. of
this City, have now completed all their
arrangements for commencing work on
this most important strategical position.
They are bound by their contract with
the United States Government to erect
within the present year a steel wharf run
ning out over the reef Into deep water.
as well as coal sheds ashore capable of
holding at least 5000 tons. In addition
there will be a caretaker's house and va
rious subsidiary buildings, all of which
will bring Uncle Sam's expenditure on
this station to considerably over $200,000.
"There is a great deal of work to do
and but little time in which to do it." re
marked "General" Tibbits yesterday, as
he sat in close consultation with his engi
neers and draughtsmen over the plans for
the pier. "In consequence we have had
to hasten our preparations.
"When we took this contract," con-
â¢inued Tibbits, "deep peace brooded over
.he land and we thought we had an easy
Job. But now since the war has devel-
oped we do not know . exactly how we
stand. We have applied to Washington
and the naval authorities have promised
us ample protection while we are carry-
ing on the work. The armed collier Bru
tus is there and wfil probably be detailed
as a guard ship at Pago Pago."
Mr. Tibbits takes with him on the Mo-
ana a force of thirty-five skilled artisans.
including two supervising engineers,
three foremen, fifteen steel workers, five
carpenters and* ten structural steel build-
ers. . Lieutenant F. T. Chambers, United
States navy, accompanies the expedition
to represent the Government's interests:
He Is accompanied by two engineers as
assistants, G. A. Mackay and E. R. Gay-
lor.. These gentlemen will see. to it that
the pier and coaling station are erected
strictly in accordance with the specifica
tions, and that the country gets full
value for its 1200.000.
"We have arranged our dates." said
the general, "so that If all goes well we
should be able to commence operations
upon the arrival of the Moana. We
should land in Apia on June 1, and my
first step will be to see the United States
Special Commissioner, Bartlett Tripp,
who Is in Samoa. If possible I will ar-
range to have our torce taken to Pago
Pago on a United States war vessel, as
that would have an excellent effect on the
wild natives of Tutuda. We are taking
with us provisions and all the materials
for house building. We have no fear of
trouble with the natives. As long as we
are under the protection of a man-of-
war's guns they will be hardly likely to
attack us."" v". â¢â¢'-â¢.
The contractors have had to take their
chances of the risks and delays of the
sea. A storm or shipwreck may at any
t'me upset all their carefully arranged
plans. For instance, their plant and ma-
terial for construction is on three dif
ferent vessels. The United States collier
Abarenda sailed on the first of this
month from an Eastern port, having on
board some 2000 tons of steel piling manu
factured by Carnegie at Pittsburg. She
Is due at â¢ Apia about the middle of
August. The Cardigan Castle, a sailing
vessel, left San Francisco on .April 25,
carrying all the machinery ana con-
tractors' plant, as well as a large quan
tity of Iron castings made in this city.
She should arrive, if she makes a good
passage, about the same time as Mr. Tib-
bits and his party.
In spite of the fact that the greater
portion of the steel work had, because of
excessive railroad rates, to be made in
the East. San Francisco is not going to
do so badly out of this contract. At least
one-half of the - $200,000 will be spent
directly or indirectly in this city. The
wages bill alone will come to more than
J20.000. Altogether some fifty or sixty men
will be gent from here at wages ranging
from 's9o to $150 per month. The men are
guaranteed at least eight months' con
stant work, and probably the term of op
erations may extend over a year.

The mail steamer Moana sailed for
Sydney, N. S. '.W., via Honolulu, H. 1.,
Apia. Samoa, and Auckland, N. Z., yes
terday. She took away an unusually
heavy cargo and every Inch of passenger
accommodation, was taken. Mail for the
Philippines went down on the steamer
and at Honolulu it will be transferred to
one of the transports.
A package of dispatches for the Ameri
can Minister and another for the British
Commissioner were put aboard the Mo
ana during the afternoon. They will be
delivered at Apia. There were also ad
vices for Admiral Kautz and Captain
Sturdee. The mail boat will not reach
Samoa until about June 7, and by that
time the representatives of America.
Great Britain and Germany will have got
things pretty well straightened out.
There was very nearly a serious con
flagration at Lombard street wharf yes
terday. A kettle of tar boiled over and
in a few minutes the structure was in a
blaze. A big pile of lumber with which
the wharf was to be repaired was close
by and in a pen adjoining were a number
of cattle and a drove of pigs. A telephone
message was sent to Captain Brown,
superintendent of tugs and dredges, and
inside of twenty minutes he had the fire
boat Governor Markham playing a stream
of water on the blaze. It was a wonder
fully quick piece of work and It saved
the Lombard street wharf and Shed.
About three years ago the Folsom street
wharf was set afire by a pot of tar boil
ing over, but on that occasion the struc
ture was destroyed.
An interesting race between the barken
tine Wrestler and brig Lurllne Is now on.
There .ire only four, berths at Kahului
and it is a case of first come first served.
Hence the race. Both vessels were to
have sailed yesterday, but Captain Niel
son of the Wrestler stole a . march and
got away Tuesday. In order to do so he
had to leave some of his freight behind
and hunt up a mate during the night.
Captain McLeod took his time and got
away at the appointed hour. He says he
can give the wrestler twenty-four hours'
start' and still beat her. When last seen
the Lurllne was literally flying under
every stitch of canvas toward Hawaii.
The first of .the fleet for the gold fields
will get away about May 22. The bark
Alaska is now loading and as soon as
all the freight is aboard she will sail.
Nearly all the passenger accommodations
are taken and the stout old craft will be
filled from stem to stern. The first stop
ping place of the Alaska will be St. Law
rence Island. From there she will go to
Golovin Bay, thence to Cape Nome. I'n
alaklik. Cape Prince of Wales. Kotzebue
Sound and Point Hope. . For all these
places she has passengers and freight,
and as soon as they are landed Captain
Cogan will go out on a whaling cruise.
He will keep the bark out on that lay
for a few months and will then come
back to San Francisco, calling at Capo
Nome on the way.

he was discovered and put to work.

ard. At Sacramento, during the recent -
session of the Legislature, Mr. R'ckard.
j as the representative of the Thirty-eighth
! Assembly District, voted throughout the
Senatorial contest for D. M. Burns. The
story was told at Sacramento that he had
a positive promise that he would be ap-
pointed Registrar of Voters in return for
his support of Burns. It was said that
Grant would have received the support of
the Assemblyman of the Thirty- eighth
District if the promise of reward had not
beep made by Burns. ' The "turning
down" of Rickard for Registrar does not
create feelings of "sorrow in the Grant
camp.
U.S. Grant Jr. arrived In the city yes
terday morning and will remain until his
brother, General Fred Grant, sails for
Manila. He is not Inclined to speak of :
Senatorial politics except in a general j
way. His Information is to the effect that |
the men who supported him at Sacra- j
mento are as active and loyal now as j
they were at any time during the contest I
in the Legislature.
The nttice of commissioner of the Bu
reau of Labor Statistics is not excep
tionally lucrative, but there are more ap
plicants for the place than are listed for
any other office at the disposal of the
Governor. Among the candidates men
tioned are' Merton Allen, Thomas O'Brien,
Assembiyman Kelsey of Santa Clara. Ma
jor Kyle, chief clerk of the Assembly; XV.
saunaers and W. T. Reynolds. Governor
Gage made the statement not long ago
that he would recognize the wishes of the
labor organizations in making this ap
pointment. He expressed a wish that the
labor unions would submit to him five
names, from which list he might select a
suitable man. It Is common report among
the politicians that the unions could not
agree on five names.
The report that J. D. Kelsey of San Jose
is securing the vigorous support of Jim
Rea and Senator C. M. Shortridge Is ac
cepted by the politicians with a few
grains of allowance. It Is admitted that
Kea and Shortridge would like well
enough to see Kelsey Installed as Labor
Commissioner, but their chief concern in
keeping 'close to Governor Gage is to se
cure the appointment on the Agnews. Asy
lum board of men who can assist them
in doing Santa Clara politics. Kelsey sup
ported Burns throughout the Senatorial
contest and will therefore derive : some
thing from the administration. M. E.
Arnerich. who was a Santa Clara Assem
blyman and a supporter of Burns, had to
be satisfied with the position of wharf
inger on the water front of San Fran
cisco. â¢ No doUbt Paris Kilburn' took or

named Arnerich for wharfinger. Similar
orders may be given to place Kelsey on

Governor Gage has planned to go south
for a session of reflection. One of his
most ardent and active supporters in the
campaign last November made the re
mark at the Palace last evening that the
Governor was going home to reflect how
it happened that he had made himself in
a few months the most unpopular man In
California. There is a notion among the
Southern California politicians that Gen
eral Harrison Gray Otis, with a club, is
waiting for Gage at . the Los Angeles
County line.
It is expected that the Governor will
shortly appoint three Port Wardens.
Among the men mentioned are A. J.
Marten, State Senator F. W. Burnett and
Assemblyman C. F. Kenneally.
The Governor has not yet made public
the names of the three menâ two Republi
cans and one Democratâ to comprise the
Paris Exposition Commission. The public
has been assured that Ben C. Truman is
appointed, and that the little formality
of a commission duly signed by the Gov
ernor Is all that prevents him from ex
ercising the authority and enjoying the
emoluments of a Commissioner. The
story Is not true that W. W. Foote has
been appointed to the commission. The
Governor has announced a purpose to ap
point a big Democrat from San Francisco,
and the talk is common that Mr. Foote
can have the office if he desires it. Yes
terday Mr. Foote, in speaking of the com
mon rumor, said that he had not ex
changed a word with the Governor on
that subject. The leading politicians are
of the opinion that Samuel Rucker of
San Jose, the prospective son-in-law of
Major Frank McLaughlin, will not be ap
pointed to the commission. The politi
cians are trying to guess the name of
the Northern California Republican that
has been slated for a place on the Expo

COMPLIMENTS FOR
EX-REGISTRAR BIGGY
STEPPACHER ASSUMES THE DU-
TIES OF THE OFFICE.
Ex-Assemblyman W. H. Rickard for
Ex-Assemblyman W. H. Rickard for
Chief Deputyâ Result of a Po
litical Compromise.
Jacob Steppacher, who was recently ap-
pointed Registrar of Voters, assumed the
duties of his office yesterday afternoon j
lat a meeting. of the Board of. Election i
Commissioners. Prior to the meeting
1 Steppacher took the oath of office before
Superior Judge Carroll Cook and filed his '
: bond in the sum of $10,000 with Auditor
Wells.
W. J. Biggy, the retiring Registrar, in- |
'' troduced his successor to the members of I
! the board, a ceremony that gave the j
1 Mayor the opportunity to say that he
hoped Steppacher would make as efficient
; an officer of the municipality as the retir- j
j ing official.
After transacting some routine business,
' Tax Collector Sheehan stated that he
' thought the time was a proper one to
j express the appreciation of the board in
' the matter of the efficient work done by
Mr Biggy during his administration. He
said Mr. Biggy had shown himself to be
a Competent and efficient officer and that
his administration had been honest and
i economical. This sentiment met with
I general approval, and upon motion of Mr.
Sheehan the secretary of the board was
Instructed to make an appropriate entry
upon the minutes.
Registrar Steppacher announced the ap- i
Dolntment of ex-Assemblyman XV. H. |
Rickard as his chief.deputy. Rickard was
a prominent candidate for appointment
to the position of Registrar, and it is
understood that his appointment as chief ;
' deputy was made a condition of Step- }
pacher's appointment to the more im
portant and lucrative place. Steppacher i
announced yesterday that no other
; changes will be made in the office force
' for several days.
DRINK CHANGED HIM.
Duden Makes a Good Husband While
Sober, but Otherwise He Is
a Bad Man.
Roland H. Duden appeared before Judge
Graham yesterday to answer a charge of
disturbing the peace preferred against
him by Miss H. Kruse, who keeps a room
ing house, at 816 A Larkin street.. â¢ Mrs.
Duden lives in her house, and she com
plained that Duden called there Tuesday
morning and demanded that some wash
ing should be handed over to him. He be
came very abusive and raised a disturb
ance. -The Judge after talking to the par
ties .suggested that they should try and
settle their differences and continued the
case for ten days.
About an hour later John Harville, 22
Montgomery street, swore to a complaint
In Judge Graham's court for the arrest of
Duden on a charge of threats to kill.
Harville alleged that Duden called at his
office yesterday morning and threatened
to fill him full of lead. Duden charged
him with instigating his wife to bring a
suit for divorce against him, which he
denied.. Mrs. Duden told Judge Graham
that her husband was all right until he
got drink in him and then he was a
changed man. ';.><&;â â >. .-"â¢-",

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Strut op Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the â 
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa- i
tive, clean singl the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
! every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
i or irritating them, make it the ideal
\ laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
i remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
I known to the California Fig Syrup j
j Co. only. In order to get its beneficial !
effects and to avoid imitations, please j
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package. i

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 17.â When it was an
nounced on Monday morning that some of the
most powerful financial Interests of the coun
try had banded themselves together for the
euppcrt of prices in the stock market, It dis
sipated very largely the timidity of the hold
ers of the group of unties which had been
so marvelously increased in price under the
favoring activities of the late ex-Governor
Flower. It also caused the professional opera
tors, who always stand ready to attack values
of securities at any vulnerable point, to pause
in their purpose and cover short contracts left
outstanding since Saturday. The capitalists
behind the Flower group apparently felt so
much encouraged with the firmness and con
fidence displayed by the market since the crisis
that they made up their minds to-day to com
plete its rehabilitation and to put prices back
to where they were on Friday last. It was
not until the latter part of the day that this
purpose seemed to be seriously in hand. In
fact, the Flower stocks as a group were con
spicuous during the early part of the day.
Their position seemed to be the natural course
of events and the general trend of the mar
ket. It was the general trend of the market
that seemed to confirm this purpose of finan
cial leaders. These events were a very marked
disinclination on the part of personal hold
ers of securities to proceed with any liquida
tion and a quiet and persistent outside de
mand for a wide range of stocks. Some very
large transactions In bonds, especially In re
cent or contemplated Issues of railroads of
the 3 and 4 per cent grades, were also in evi
dence in the pressing demand for investment
from a large reserve of capital. The money
market was notably easy and advices from
different points In the interior were of large
funds on hand. The statements of St. Paul's
earnings for the second week In May show
ing an Increase of over $24,000, compared with
the corresponding week last year, when the
extraordinary grain movement Incident to the
Lelter deal was In progress, was taken to
Indicate a continued prosperous condition of
railroad traffic. London also showed a fav
orable disposition toward American railroads
and advance. 1 prices before the opening here.
And although part of the purchases were re
sold later, having some possible strength In
the rate of exchange In London, the sales were
not in sufficient volume to threaten the money
market lure. More mature consideration of the
trade statistics for April disclosed the con
tinued strong position of our International com
merce, notwithstanding comparisons at some
points with th- unprecedented period of last
year. The market gradually but persistently
hardened under these Influences early In the
day. Central and Southern Pacific, Chicago
Terminal, the Iron and- steel shares. Sugar
and Tobacco and New York municipal corpora
tion stocks advancing sharply. In the late
afternoon the mamet leaders undertook to push
up Brooklyn Transit to where it was last
Friday. This they did through a flood of
offerings, and held it there to the close, seven
points above yesterday's close. People's Gas,
the Federal Steel stocks. International Paper,
Rock Island and Atchison preferred are from
one to four points higher. The railroads shared
very generally In the strength, the .lose be
ing buoyant and at the top.
The large demand for bonds sought persist
ently for pretty much all issues not already at
prohibitive prices. Total sales. $4,890,000. Unit
ed States new 4s and the old 4s registered
advanced 4 in the bid price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
I CHICAGO, May Reports of serious dam-
age to growing wheat by bugs and files put
wheat traders In a bullish mood at the start,
and with the exception of a slight dip early on
realizing the market ruled strong throughout
the session. Statements that California would
yield only half a crop attracted a good deal of
attention. July opened %c higher at 714 c, de-
clined to 71c, advanced to 72% c, and closed at
7140714 c, an advance on the day of %o%c.
The cash demand was slow and receipts were
light.
Corn declined under liquidation owing to fa-
vorable en* news and the embarrassed condi
tion of the cash trade. July declined %o%c.
Prospects of Bmall deliveries before August
strengthened oats, but the market finally weak-
ened In sympathy with corn, July closing a
shade higher.
Liberal -receipts of hogs and the weakness in
corn handicapped provisions. Shipments
small. Pork left off with a loss of 10@174c and
lard and ribs lost 2405 c each.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. May 17.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow; The
wool market continues strong and active. The
featured of the week's business has been the
continued large demand for export, principally
for Australian wools in bond and for the Ter
ritories. The movement in the latter bids fair
t o assume large proportions, unless the holders
of such wool raise their asking prices to higher
figures than foreigners will pay. Already,
however, several million pounds of Territory
have been sold for export. About 600,000 pounds
are reported as having been sold In Phila
delphia last week to Germany, the wool costing
the purchaser 45c clean, while additional lines
have been taken here during the past week.
Prices are strong. The country markets are
excited.
The sales of the week In Boston amount to
4,113.000 pounds domestic and 4,200.600 foreign,
making a total of 8,315,600, against a total of
7,598,000 for the previous week and a total of
1,402,500 for the corresponding week last year.
Sales since January 1. 1899, amounted to 89,
- pounds, against 46,008,310 pounds last
year at this time.
LONDON .WOOL PALES.
LONDON. May 17.â The wool auction sales
were continued to-day with a large number of
buyers present. A selection of New Zealand
merino, the best offered in some time, was in
strong demand as were also some fine cross
breds. Both of these grades easily realized
the best prices of last week, the Yorkshire
representatives securing the bulk. The offer-
ings numbered 11.S00 bales.

According to a printed copy of the reports
submitted to the stockholders of , the Hutchin-
son Sugar Plantation Company at the recent
annual meeting, the crop" of 1898 was 8360 tons,
or 760 tons In. excess of the estimate made a
year ago. The crop for the 1899 season Is esti-
mated at 7000 tons. The reason for placing It
at that figure is due to the lessened rainfall on
the plantation, which .'has . been 30% inches
against 53 Inches in the previous year. The r--
t,irn-sio irom the 189S crÂ°P sold show an average
of $,2 6a per ton, which is $10 32 per ton more
than for the previous year, thus making a dif
ference of over $84,000. enough of itself to pay
â¢reÂ«&*Y'dends' wlth a Eood. margin besides.

unsold is estimated at $70 per ton. The mill at

ARE CLASSED
AS WHITES
Not Segregated on the
School Rolls.
â -â¦ â
NO IDEA OF THEIR NUMBER
â Â« â
THEY PAY NO TUITION FEE AND
HAVE ALL PRIVILEGES.
Â»
One School Has Turned Away White
Children for Lack of Room While
Japanese Were Occu
pying Desks.
i
There is no toiling by th<> figures of the
re is no toilinp: by the figures of the
school census just how many Japanese
are enjoying the benefit of free entry into
the schools of this city. They are not j
classed as Mongolians, and thai is the I
"nly class distinction made. Should a |
class he composed of forty-two whites and
three Japanese children Ii is carried on
the books of the department as a class of
forty-five. They are not separated In any
way, either In the schoolroom or in the I
statistics of the board, and so there in
be no more than a guess, and that a
very rough one, at the number now at
tending the public schools.
The department has never taken any ac
tion In regard to the little brown men
except on one occasion, when the Super
intendent tried to collect a tuition fee
from each, Under the law, non-residents
must pay a certain fee every ear for the i
privilege of attending the city schools,
and it was contended by the Superintend
ent of Schools that the Japanese pupils
were non-residents. As soon as this deci
sion was made known and the lirst at
tempt was made to collect the fee the I
missionaries who worked among the Jap
anese, here commenced to oppose the
proposition. It was claimed that the
Japanese attending the schools were resi
dents, as they were under the guardian- !
ship of residents and had severed all con
nection with the land of their birth. The
light made against the proposition caused
I
it to he laid aside, and now the Japanese !
have an equal chance with the white chil
dren of the city. .*..',>''' "
< >ver 100 is the smallest estimate any
one in authority at the office of the School
Board would put upon the number now
in the schools. Of this number the greater
portion attend the night schools, as nearly
all of them work in the day time. As a
rule, they are. pood pupils. They attend
strictly to business and there has never
been a complaint to the board from
teacher, classmate or parent. In the
Washington Evening School there are
twelve and In the Lincoln Evening School
there are fifteen, while the other evening
schools will show less than those num
bers In each. â  .:*. :.Â»--.â -.
In the day schools ten or twelve would
be considered a good umber, and it is
(nut often the figure rises so high, but
the Japanese have been becoming mora
numerous- as the y*ars pass, and where;
a few years ago a Japanese scholar
caused remark, now he is not thought of.
The greatest complaint against the. free
dom of the schools for the Japanese
comes from the Western Addition, where
the schools are already very much crowd
ed, and it frequently happens that white
scholars have been turned away for lack .
of room while at the same time there '
were attending th.- same school several
Japanese pupils, none of whom were pay
ing a cent of tuition; This is reported
to have happened out at the Pacific

stance.
It is urged, too, that numbers of Jap
anese far beyond the legal school age are
attending the public schools; they have
given their age as being much less than
it is and so come in with younger chil
dren. There re many full-grown Jap
anese who are now attending the pri
mary classes with children of from 6 to
10 years old.
Superintendent Webster says he Is will
ing to make every Japanese who .aims
he is under legal guardianship In this
city prove that fact or pay the regular
tuition fee. He Is also willing to ascer
tain the exact number and standing of
the Japanese on the school rolls, and he
â will probably set about this at once in
response to a request to that effect from
the president of the Western Addition
Improvement Club, the organization
â¢which started the present agitation.
The Chinese have a school of their own
and they have to attend that school or
no other, and the only way to exclude the
Japanese.l; in the opinion of the Superin
tendent, is to pass a similar law restrict
ing all Japanese to certain schools.

WELL COOKED FOOD.
Practically every one wants some
sort of cereal for breakfast, but the
trouble of cooking the regular oatmeal
is something, and in the majority of
cases it is sticky, pasty and too much
like raw starch.
Grape-Nuts offer the ideal breakfast
food, for they require no cooking what-
ever, being thoroughly cooked at the
factory, and are therefore ready for
instant service. The food is cooked by
experts and the family does not have
to depend on the cook's ability or tem-
per for the quality of the morning
dish. Grape-Nuts are pre-digested and
suit the weakest as well as the strong-
est stomach. Sold by grocers and made

DR. BAZET
HONORED
DR. LOUIS BAZET, the well-known
physician of this city, head of the
San Francisco Polyclinic, and a man
whose position in the front rank of
local practitioners is an acknowledged
fact, yesterday received a letter from the
Government of Portugal, Informing him
that he had been appointed by the King
a Knight of the' Ancient Military Order of
Jesus Christ. This is an exceedingly rare
honor to be conferred upon a' foreigner
and is made, so the letter states. In ac
knowledgment of Dr. Bazet's kindness to
the Portuguese residents of San Fran
cisco. The Portuguese Consul, Ignacio
da Costa Duarte, has been instructed to
confer with Dr. Bazet and arrange for the
forma! investment of the physician with
the insignia of the order.
Some time ago the Portuguese residents
of San Francisco forwarded a petition to
Lisbon, calling the attention of the King
to the services of the doctor and asking
that he be honored with some mark of
distinction as a "fitting reward. The
royal decree making him a knight of the.
grand old order, which was founded in
1317, is the answer of the King to the pe
tition of his former subjects.

The tour of inspection by" Mayor
Pip lan, city officers and members of the
Board of Education, for the purpose of
examining into the condition of school
houses and accessory buildings, was con
tinued and. concluded yesterday. During
the morning several dispensaries . of
learning were visited and In each place
the sanitary conditions and stability of
the buildings were noted, and will be em
bodied in a special report which will be
presented to the Supervisors in the form
of a recommendation for an appropria
tion with which to repair dilapidated
school property and place it in a state
conducive to health.
The idea of inviting the Mayor and
officials outside of the .school depart
ment, to view for themselves' the neces
sity of additional funds for the attention
of property which is fast going to wreck
was conceived by George R. Armstrong,
chairman of the Buildings and Grounds
Committee. Accordingly, he arranged for
the transportation of the inspectors, and
on Tuesday a large part of the school
territory of the city was covered. Yes
terday the party, composed of Mayor
Phelan, Auditor Wells, W. R. Sherwood
of the Merchants' Association, C. A.
Murdock, foreman of the Grand Jury,
Supervisor Deasv, President Bergerot :of
the Board of Education. Architect Welch.
Inspector George Walker, Assistant In
spector XV. E. Commary and Directors
Kemp, -Hoi brook, Armstrong, Gedge,
Brenaenstein, Conlon and Stohl, again
took leave of the City Hall. .
The first place visited was the Frank
lin Grammar School, after which the
Buena Vista School was inspected. , The
Height Primary, Which was condemned
four years ago, was next on the list, and
then the party journeyed to the Fair
mount Primary, then to Monroe Primary,
Mission Grammar and Marshall Primary.
In every school visited, with the excep
tion of one,' sanitary conditions were ex
ceedingly poor, and in many cases dan
gerous to the health of children. The
sheds, fences, outbuildings and plank
walks were sadly in need of repairs, and
theseÂ« things were pointed out to the
members of the party.
Mayor Phelan took a number of notes
and asked a few questions. He often ex
pressed disgust at some things which ex
isted, but was non-committal on the sub
ject of a general remedy. He is in favor.
however, of attending to the wants of
health immediately. The total amount
asked for by the board borders on $350,
--000, and will" include the construction of
several new buildings. Some of the
schools are crowded to nearly twice their.
capacity, and It has been proposed to
either raise them one story or to build
wings on either side. The amount will 1> â¢

recommendation that it be set aside from
public funds will be presented to tie-

BERKELEY, May 17.â Exactly 360
BERKELEY. May 37. -Exactly 360
students graduated from the University
of California to-day. They received their
diplomas at the public commencement ex
orcises held in a big tent this morning
upon the university campus.
Although 10:30 o'clock had been set as
the time for beginning the graduating
ceren\ony, the friends of the candidates
for degrees 'axed the big tent to Its ut
most capacity long before the hour ar
rived. Hundreds of people from San
Francisco and Oakland had to he con
tent with standing outside. A large plat
form had been erected at one end for the
president and members of the faculty.
On both sides stood chairs and seats for
the students. An elaborate display of
palms and potted plants from the univer
sity conservatory served to cover up the
bareness of the whole.
Shortly after 10 o'clock, with President
Martin Kellogg in the lead, the pro
cession of graduates, members of the
faculty and regents started from Stiles
Hall. They walked across the campus in
double file, the women dressed in white.
wearing the black cap and gown, the. men
for th.- most part In black. The scene
was full of academic mpressiveness as
the venerable president, clad In a doc
tor's gown, took his seat upon tne plat
form, followed by the members of the
Board of Regents in a body, and a ma
jority of the university professors, while
the 360 graduates arranged themselves on
either side As soon as all were seated.
the Rev. George B. Hatch of Berkeley
offered prayer.
Following was the order of 'exercises:
Festival overture. I.eutner: prayer. Rev.
George B. Hatch; statement by the president:
serenade, Titi; ..ration. 'Exituri Salutamus."
GeorKe Elliott Ebrijrht, of the medical depart
ment: oration. "Self-Sacrifice and Self-Asser
tion." Roy Victor Nye; "Album Leaf," Wag
ner; oration. "The Duties of the Legal Pro
fession In the Present Crisis." Adolph Leopold
Well. Ph.B., of the Hastings College of the
Law; oration. "The Debt the Graduate of the
University of California Owes to the State."
Miss Lily Hohfeld; Walts, "Artist's Life,"
Strauss: conferring of degrees, by the presi
dent; delivery of mllltarv commissions, by Pro
fessor Frank Soule; benediction, Rev. Horatio
Stebbins. D.D.
In his opening address President Kel
logg announced, the official statistics of
the number of students in the university.
There were, he said. 1750 In the colleges at
Berkeley and 2200 altogether, including
the Affiliated Colleges in San Francisco.
This meant an increase of 46 per cent In
ten years. The president deplored the
fact that with this unprecedented increase
in numbers the funds available for the
expenses of the institution had in the last
ten years Increased but 33 per cent. The
next year, he explained, even allowing
for every economy, would show a deficit
of 147,000. He urged the alumni and all
the friends of the university to use their
efforts in helping to lighten the financial
burden resting upon their Alma Mater.
Under the title. "Exituri Salutamus,"
George Elliott right of the medical
department delivered a brief oration in
tended to set forth the right attitude of
the physician just graduated toward the
profession of his choice. Mr. Ebright
found no-cause for alarm In the fact that
the practice of medicine was already
overcrowded. "As long as sickness and
any form of organic evil exists," he said,
"the physician will be needed; and not
until every problem of disease Is over
come may his labor cease. To this end
the physician must regard his calling as
a sacred duty. Putting pecuniary recom
pense aside, he should struggle under tho
white banner of charity, seeking no other
reward save the reward of the work It
self."
Mr. Ebright was followed by Roy Victor
Nye, president of the senior class. Mr.
Nye's oration was entitled "Self-sacrifice
and Self-assertion." He outlined briefly
the principles Involved ln each of these
two motives of conduct, and concluded
that both were necessary, that the one
must counterbalance the other In a true
realization of the rids of life.
Adolph Leopold Well, Ph.H.. spoke upon
"The Duties of the Legal Profession in
the Present Crisis." Mr. Well is about to
enter the legal profession, after getting
through the Hastings College of Law.
His opinions about expansion and im
perialism are decidedly in opposition to
these policies, and he accordingly con
cluded that the legal profession ought to
think that way too. Chief Justice Mar
shall was all wrong, he declared, in many
of his decisions, and particularly in all
those which have been construed In favor
of the present policy of the Government.
Miss Lily Hohfeld, the university
medalist for the present year, delivered
the last oration. The title was "The Debt
the Graduate of the University of Cali
fornia Owes the State." "Free education
on the part of the State," she said, "was
an implied promise to give something
back in return. The college graduate has
a two-fold duty: he must help in the
shaping of a rational and Intelligent pub
lic opinion, and he must embody in his
personal life the ideals of his own na
ture."
At the conclusion of Miss Hohfeld's ad
dress President Kollogg proceeded with
the awarding of diplomas. The candi
dates for degrees from the different col
leges were asked to stand while their
names were read off and tho diplomas
were handed to them. In the absence of
Governor Gage, Professor Frank Soule,
commandant of the University Corps of
Cadets, delivered the military commis
sions to the cadet officers. After the Rev.
Horatio Stebbins of San Francisco had
pronounced a benediction the ceremonies
concluded.
A full list of all the graduates, together
with the military commissions and the
names of those to whom scholarships
have been granted for the ensuing year,
was published ln The Call of to-day.
Following the exercises came the annual
alumni reunion and luncheon ln the Har
mon Gymnasium. After luncheon had
been served the following programme,
consisting of speeches by alumni, was
carried out:
Welcome, Professor William E. Hitter, .'BB.
president of the Associated Alumni; "The
Faculty Point of View." President Martin Kel
logg; music, selections, "Carmen" (Bizet);
"Recent Developments in Higher Education,"
Professor John Dewey; "Thirty Tears. ln the
Vineyard," Professor Frank Soule; music,
overture, "National," United States (Gilmore);
"Co-education Then and Now," Mrs. Alex
ander F. Morrison, '78; music, cornet polo,
"The Song That Reached My Heart" (Jordan);
"The Medical Alumnus," James F. McCone,
'92; musk-, college songs (Chadwick); "Higher

Plumbing Inspectors Sullivan. Kelly
and Ward made an exhaustive report on
the sanitary condition of the City Hall
relative to the plumbing in the building.
The report shows that some of the
plumbing has been In place almost twenty
years and Is now practically worthless.
The condition of the plumbing in the City
Prison. Auditor's office and the office of
the Assessor is reported as being partic- I
ularly bad. Many of the drain pipes lead
ing from the roof of the building to the
sewers have been broken or are otherwise i
defective, so that the water runs direct
into the sub-basement. Some of these
pipes have evidently been stolen, as many !
joints are missing and cannot be found. !
Particular attention is given the plumb- ,
ing in the City Prison, which is out of
date and wholly Inadequate to the needs
of the institution. The report was re- .
ferred to the Buildings Committe of the
Board of Supervisors.
The charge of incivility ' preferred
against Assistant Secretary Zobel some
time ago by Mrs. White was dismissed,
there being insufficient evidence to sup
port the charge.^gpiSEax
The board by unanimous consent In
dorsed the proposition for the establish
ment of a Chinese hospital where all Chi
nese cases other than those of a con
tagious nature may be gathered under
one. roof, where their treatment may be '
supervised by American physicians.
The resignation of W. Cavelry, Inspec- |
tor of Garbage, was received and ac
cepted. W. Greeg was appointed to the
vacancy,
A communication was received from
General Shafter. expressing a desire on
his part to assist the board In any way
within his power in the matter of quar
antine affairs and explaining that the af
fairs of the Federal quarantine were
without his jurisdiction.

INTERNAL REVENUE RULINGS.
Gift Conveyances Taxableâ Witch
' .Hazel' Is Toilet Water.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
has decided that all gift conveyances of
real estate are subject to taxation, and
the tax Is based upon the value of the
real estate conveyed by the Instrument,
and this value is to be found as though
the property was unincumbered, if it is
incumbered. When a husband desires to
convey property to his wife for the pur
pose of a gift, and the property is con
veyed to a third party, and by said third
party conveyed to the wife, both deeds
are subject to a taxation based on the
value of the property, conveyed.
Another decision rescinds the former.

HARES WILL SUFFER.
Dogs That Will Run to Kill at Union
Park on Saturday and Sunday.
Owing to the exasperating delays that
1 are occasioned in the journey to and from
Union Coursing Park when traveling on
the steam cars coursing enthusiasts are
now taking advantage of the quick trips
that are made from this city by the San
: Francisco and San Mateo Electric Rail
road direct to the grounds. The fare is
i only 10 cents, and the ride on the electric
i road is far more pleasant than the jour
ney on the steam cars, which make . sev
eral unnecessary stops to allow freight
and passenger trains the right of way.
The ieashmen are now patronizing the
electric road because of its superior ac
commodations.
A drawing for the meeting which will
be held on Saturday took place last even-

SOCIALIST LABOR PROPAGANDA
, . â â Â-,
Horace Davis and Others Talk on the
Communal Spirit.
Communal Spirit.
The members . of the Propaganda Club
of. the Socialist Labor party composed
the audience last night at Turk-street
Temple during an address by -Horace
Davis on "The Communal Spirit in Mod
ern Times." The, speaker traced the
progress of the human race from primi
tive days when the tribal relation ex
isted until the present, when the highest
type of individualism prevailed. He
traced the history of the development of
individuality and IS the I corresponding
growth of competition, Which, while it
had cheapened the necessaries of life, had
its dark side. This, he claimed, was the
fact that the moral spirit of the race
had not kept pace with the physical.
In the usual, ten minute periods al
lowed to members of the . club to set
forth their differences of opinion from
the speaker John Lee was very happy in
his remarks. He poked considerable rid
icule at the argument of the speaker of
the evening, taking particular exception
to his definition of liberty, holding that
there was one kind for the fox and an
other for the gooseâ in other words, that
liberty for the capitalist meant death for
the people. , '
"The legislation of capital," he said, is
commercial legislation; its church Is a
commercial church and its morality is a
commercial morality."
G. B. Benham. who followed, held that
capitalists thought only of two things
profit and philanthropy, how to take : a
dollar from the poor man with the right
hand and give him back a dime with the
left; to build churches, a la Carnegie
and a la Rockefeller, with dollars robbed
from the poor. Mr. Thompson followed
in a similar strain, and the meeting ad
journed after a short address by Mr. Da
vis, in which he sought- to correct some
false Impressions he thought the au
dience might have gained from his first
address.

WHOLESALERS TO
GO EAST TO ASK
FOR HIGHER RATES
Hardware Jobbers Will Fight to
Keep Eastern Dealers From
Western Trade.
Delegation of Local Merchants Will Con-
fer With the Agents for the North-
crn Railroads They Will Leave
To-Night for St. Paul. .Â»
THE fight that has hern a-brewing for
three weeks past between the big
hardware wholesalers of California,
Oregon and Washington and the big
ger Jobbers of St. Louis. St. Paul and
Chicago for Western trade and the retail
trade of Intermediate points is on in dead
earnest, and San Francisco is well to the
front on the firing line.
From the defensive the home merchants
have switched to the aggressive in the
past week, and to-night a delegation of
the heavy-weight dealers of this city will
leave for St. Paul to carry the battle into
the heart of the enemy's camp. The wits
of the biggest dealers of the West, backed
by the Ogden and southern railroad lines,
are arrayed against the money, the
brains and the influx Of the immense
firms of the East, In combination with
the. Great Northern and Northern Pacific
railroads; the. fight is to be of no mean
proportions,
Since it was first announced in The Call
three weeks ago that the Northern Pacific
and Great Northern had secretly made a
new tariff on Western freight in less than
carload lots for the benefit of the dealers
of the Middle East, the merchants of this
city have been holding almost daily meet
ings to devise ways and means to combat
the powerful Influence so quietly working
against them.
That the two northern roads had broken
faith and had been :alse to the compact
entered into by them last May with the
other transcontinental lines was at first
mere rumor and the agents of the local
firms had the greatest difficulty in verify
ing it. The wnolesalers of Portland, Ta
coma, Seattle and Spokane were com
municated with, and they entered into
hearty co-operation with their California
brethren, with the result that copies of
the new tariff sheets were secured and
the duplicity of the northern lines proved.
Numerous plans were talked over and
dropped. No satisfaction was to be
gained by letters or telegrams sent to
the traffic managers of the two lines, and
Eastern hardware and groceries began to
pour Into the northern markets on equal
terms with the home merchants. The
Seattle and Tacoma dealers were well
nigh desperate and they kept the wires to
San Francisco hot with advices.
A week ago the plan at present being
consummated was broached and it found
immediate favor. The traffic committee
of the Metal and Hardware Association
took it up and elaborated upon it. and as
a result four of the most prominent mem
bers of the association will leave to-night
for St. Paul, where a meeting has been
arranged with the traffic managers of the
two backsliding roads.
San Francisco will be represented by
W. R. Wheeler, manager for Holbrook,
Merrill & Stetson and Chairman of the
Metal and Hardware Association; Charles
P. Tay of the George li. '.ay Company.
H. D. Eoveland of the California Whole
sale Grocery Dealers' Association and
Mr. Carrlgan of the firm of Dunham-
Carrigan Co.
The Callforniana will not Â»â â¢â¢ to fight
alone by any means. Portland is sending
a delegation of ten of her biggest busi
ness men, Seattle Is sending six. Spokane
two and Tacoma has a list of a half
dozen or more. They will rendezvous at
St. Paul and will descend In force upon
the heads of representatives of the two
roads. They will ask the reason for their
unlooked-for action and present their own
case and arguments in an effort to have
the old rati restored.
â  Concerning the situation as It effects
the dealers of the West, Mr. Wheeler said
last night: "We are not going to St. Paul
to make a fisrht against the two roads,
but simply to state our case. it is a just
one. and upon presentation I think it will
win. If we do not, I cannot say what
the result will be.
"This whole thing is neither more nor
ADVERTISEMENTS.
When we read of a railroad wreck in
When we read of a railroad wreck in
which a hundred people arc killed, we are
filled with pity and horror. There are other
dangers in this life a thousand times greater
than that of the railroad wreck, only we do
not have them brought so forcibly to our
attention. Consumption does not kill a
hundred people at once in one train. It
does kill tens. of thousands for everyone
that is killed by accident.
If a sufferer will resort to the right rem-
edy before it is too late, consumption can
be cured. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery cures 08 per cent, of all cases if
taken in the earlier stages. It has main-
tained this record for thitty years. Many
of those whom it has rescued from the
verge of the grave have permitted their
names, addresses, experiences and photo-
graphs to be printed in Dr. Pierces Com-
mon Sense Medical Adviser. This useful
book is free, and any sufferer who wishes
to investigate may procure it and write to
these who were once sufferers themselves.
For a paper covered copy send 21 one-cent
stamps, to rover cost of mailing only, to
the World's Dispensary Medical Associa-
tion, Buffalo, X. Y. The "Golden Medical
Discovery" is the great blood-maker and
flesh-builder. It restores the lost appetite,
corrects the impaired digestion, makes the
liver active and the blood pure. Any med-
icine dealer who offers you something
else said tobe "just as good" is thinking
about his pocketbook and not about your
health.
"I have taken Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery and ' Favorite Prescription ' with
wonderful results. " writes Mrs. Annie M. Nor-
man, of Equinunk. Wayne Co.. Pa. "I had
consumption: the doctors said I'd die. The
'Golden Medical Discovery' cured me." â¢< ;

Louis Sauret was found lying uncon
scious on the floor of his home, 130 Sec
ond street, at about 5 o'clock last night.
There was a jagged wound in his throat
extending back to the neck bone. From
the peculiar circumstances surrounding
; the case it was first thought that mur
der had been attempted, and Detective
Ryan was put on the case. He made a
, thorough investigation, and Is now satis
fied that Sauret was despondent and at-
tempted to end his life.
The body was found by Mrs. Sauret,
the two months' bride of the injured
man. She, with her sister, went to the
bank yesterday afternoon. When they
returned they found the door of the sin
gle room occupied by the family standing
wide open and Sauret apparently dead in
a poo] of blood. Blood was spattered
over everything, and there were several
pools on the floor. Mrs. Sauret, without
making an investigation, at once notiiied
Policeman James Cooke that her husband
had killed himself. Policeman Cooke
accompanied by Policeman Sullivan, vis
ited the premises, and after a hasty ex
amination they notified the Coroner's
office.
Detective Ryan arrived a short time'
before the Morgue wagon, and in turn
ing over the body to see how many
wounds had been inflicted he discovered
that the man was still alive. The am
bulance was hastily summoned and '
Sauret was taken to the Harbor Receiving !
Hospital, where his wounds were
dressed. It was found that the windpipe
and gullet had been cut through, but
none of the arteries were severed. A
breathing tube was introduced into the
man's throat, but the chances are he will
die without gaining consciousness.
Bauret was married in Portland two
months ago to the divorced wife of John
Jalbert. Since that time he has refused
to work, living off the savings of his wife
and the scanty income she received by
taking in lodgers. She threatened to de- â 
sert him if he would not go to work, and
he in turn threatened suicide. Yesterday
before going out she told hjm that In the
future he could have but' dO cents a day
to live on and he said he guessed she did
not love him any more and that he might
as well die.
The wife of Sauret visited police head- i
quarters last evening and she was close- j
ly questioned by the detectives. She de- !
clared she was satisfied that her hus
band had inflicted the fatal wound, as
he had on several occasions threatened
to commit suicide. A short time before
he was discovered. Mrs. Sauret says, she
told him that unless he stopped drink
ing she would have to leave him.
Sauret replied that if she left him he
would kill himself. She believes that
after she left the house Sauret, evidently
touched by her words and fearing that
she threatened to separate from him, cut
his throat. Mrs. Sauret says the father
of the despondent man committed suicide
in Paris about thirteen years ago by |
hanging himself.

The Mongolian Cemetery the Scene cf
The Mongolian Cemetery the Scene of
a Sanguinary Ceremony Wherein
the Gods Are Called Upon
to Take Part.
There is trouble In the office of the Lee
Yuen Chung Lottery at 735 Commercial
streetâ the kind of trouble that calls for
gore; not human blood, but that of a
more inoffensive bipedâ the chicken.
It all conies about through a certain
ticket on a drawing which took place ]
eleven days ago, and which purported to
net the winner somewhere in the neigh
borhood of $2000. A subject of the Celes
tial Kingdom claims that he bought the
ticket from a regular agent of the com- I
pany, and when the proper characters !
appeared in the published account of the
drawing he found that he was enriched
by an unexpected sum. But when he pre
sented the ticket for the cash the trouble
began, for he was informed that no such
ticket had been sold.
As the purchaser was known as a rep- I
! Utable Chinaman, it looked bad for the j
j company, and immediately the revenue of
I the association began to dwindleâ not 'â 
j through the interference of the police but
! because the other Chinamen looked with \
; suspicion upon the drawings. Things were
i growing dark for the financial end of the
j company, and It became necessary to do
; something to restore confidence.
At the same time, there were whispers
I of corruption within the inner circles of
j the company, and It was hinted that some
i member was doing a little "grafting" on
I his own account and selling tickets \Â»ith
i out making proper returns. This was a
j serious condition, and there was but one
j method known to the Oriental mind by
which it could be conclusively proven. It
I was decided to make each member of the
â  company take the dire oath, and last
! Sunday the five principals in the company
j went to the Chinese Cemetery and, with
| many genuflections before the altar, each
j individual swore by all that is sacred to
j a Chinese that he had done nothing
wrong. At the conclusion of his oath
each member decapitated a chicken, say
, ing that as it happened to the fowl should
It happen to him if he swore falsely; in
other words, if he lied he would get it in
. the neck. :' . -
This ceremony fully satisfied the mem-
I hers that nothing was wrong in the com
: pany, but there still remained the sus-
I picion against it. and it was decided to
! make a general ceremony. Including the
five members of the company, their ten
! employes and the complainant. According !
to Chinese etiquette the company must ,

purge Itself within fifteen days after the
drawing or Its business will go to the
dogs. As eleven days have now passed
it Is necessary to have something definite
done within the next four days, conse
quently there will be a procession of six
teen men and a priest to, the cemetery
within that time and there will be chicken
dinners in sixteen Mongolian families,
provided all sixteen are honest in their
statements. ';â  *? â ''â  >*>*
If any member of the lottery company
or any employe refuses to take the oath,
then the company must pay the full
amount called for by the ticket. If the
claimant refuses, then the company is
absolved. Should all parties take the oath
and shed the blood of the chicken, then It
will be understood that- there has been a
misunderstanding and the matter will be
compromised and the. company will be re
instated into the good graces of Chinese
lottery lovers and the game will go mer
rily on. as It has done in the past, the
police to the contrary notwithstanding.

The Bow Wah Tong, or, in English, the
Chinese Slave Dealers' Association, has
called upon a 800 How Doy Tong, or, as
it is better known, a highbinder associa
tion, to rid the Chinese community of
three men who are especially obnoxious
to the evil-doers of the Chinese quarter.
A price has been set on the heads of
three members of the Chinese Society for
English Education because it is believed
that they are responsible for the organiza
tion of the Vigilance Society among the
white people, who wish to put a stop to
the Iniquities of Chinatown.
On the. head of Ong Foon is set $1000,
Chin Jim is rated at $500 and Chin Suey
is also a low-priced man, with $500 as his
value.' ~-V /; --:/ '-â  i :-;
The Slave Dealers' Association is com
posed of something more than a hundred
Chinese, who represent an ownership in
more than 150 slave dens and about 1400
human chattels. Three meetings of the
association have been held this week at
the headquarters of the association, 10
Brenham place, and the result was that
the hatchet men have been told to rid
the community of the three men who are
believed to be responsible for the trouble
that has been brought upon the mints
where Celestial immorality is being coined
into American dollars.
An assessment was levied on every
slave girl in Chinatown of $2 a week and
a fund organized to light the vigilantes
and also to rid the association of those
who are in its way. The assessment will
bring. a big corruption fund into the cof
fers of the association, and they say it
will be used without limit to crush out
the vigilantes while they are young and
put a stop to any further interference
. Some time to-day the Vigilant Society
will forward to Mayor Phelan a l?st of
he houses of ill fame in Chinatown, the^r
location, the name of the slave owner and
of the owner of the property and the
number of inmates in each place. It will
then remain for the Mayor to ear-rv out
the provisions of the law providing for
whVhUPhP/eSSiO? of such houses, in doing
â¢,clllpte must notify the owners of the
Sh_l_Â£i7 and the owners of the dens of
