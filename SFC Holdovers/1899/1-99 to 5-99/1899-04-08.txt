JAMAICANS THREATEN
TO SEEK ANNEXATION
Demand the Dismissal of the Present
British Officials, and Burn Them
in Effigy.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. April 7. â The council adjourned to-day, leaving the political situa
tion almost chaotic, the representatives having passed a vote of censure on the officers of
the Government and having adopted a resolution demanding their removal, including
the Governor. Sir Augustus Hemming.
Last night throughout the r nil parishes mass meetings were held and effigies of Joseph
Chamberlain, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies; Governor Hemming and Mr. Pa
lache. a representative who. at the final crisis, voted with the Government and who holds a
Government appointment, were burned. There were no other violent developments, but the
leaders are reported to be formulating a monster popular ultimatum to the Imperial Govern
ment demanding the restoration of the original autonomous constitution of 1866, with the al
ternative of annexation to the United States. The agitators say that if both demands are re
fused and a coercive policy is maintained, serious trouHe may develop.

PARIS. April 7.â The Figaro gets
back it the anti-Dreyfus papers, which
maliciously announced that several
clubs intended to boycott it to-day. It
states that a committee of the Cercle
de I'Union Artistique, generally known
as TEpatant. one of the very clubs in
question, is about to meet to vote on
ttja expulsion of Major Esterhazy, who
has been a member for twenty-five
years.
The papers are full of denials and ex
planations from the various individuals
accused by General Roget, and Exam
ining Magistrate Bortulus demands to
be confronted with the general before
the Court of Cassation. In the mean
while he has written officially to M.
Mazeau, the president of the Court of
Cassation, and to M. Manu, the prose
cutor general, demanding an inquiry
into his private life and the manner in
which he fills his position as a magis
trate. He also promises to produce be
fore the Court of Cassation witnesses
to corroborate his evidence in regard
to the late Lieutenant Colonel Henry
and others and declares General Ro
ger allegations against himself are
absolutely false.
M. Reinach has written a similar let
ter to M. Mazeau, demanding to be
confronted with General Roget.

BRUSSELS, April ".âThere was a bomb
explosion at Puy Citadel this afternoon,
and it was at first thought it was due to
crime, but it proved to have â¢en caused
by the accidental bursting of a shell while
a lieutenant was teaching ten soldiers
how to load a cannon.
The violence of the shock hurled the
eleven men. some distance. Two were
killed on the spot, and two are in a hope
less condition. The others, including the
lieutenant, were seriously wounded.
The ground on which the barracks stand
partially collapsed.
An evening paper suggests that they lay
before the disarmament conference sta
tistics of the Toulon, Bourges. Puy and
similar disasters, showing that even in
peace time the present perfected weapons
are self-dtstroying for all nations.

Major McConnvllle's body was ac
companied by his son, Private McConn

orably discharged by the department
that he might accompany his father's
body to Idaho. Major McConnville was

There wai some little trouble occa

would not permit of its landing unless

Two privates convalescing from gun

GERMAN RIFLEMEN
AIDED THE SAMOANS
YANKEES AND BRITONS SIDE BY SIDE.
The one fact which the recent disturbances in Samoa have brought most markedly into prominence is
the unanimity of feeling between English and .Americans in the group. Throughout the whole trouble the
British and United States Consuls have acted in perfect harmony. Their negotiations have had one common
aim â the supremacy of the English-speaking races. When it came to fighting British and American bluejackets
lined the trenches like brethren and speedily repulsed the ferocious Samoans. During the attack on the British
consulate American jackies from the Philadelphia worked their Gatling gun with murderous effect, while Eng
lish tars Trom the Royalist and Porpoise held the trenches with their small arms.
APIA. Samoa, March 24.â King Ta
numafili Malietoa, accompanied
by High Chief Tamasese (who
will occupy the position of Vice
King) was crowned King of Sa
moa at Mulinuu yesterday. Admiral
Kautz and Captain White of the Phila
delphia. Captains Sturdee and Torles^e
of the Porpoise and Royalist, United
States Consul General Osborn, Consul
Maxse and Chiei Justice Ide were
present at the ceremony, which was
attended by all representative Ameri
cans and Britishers. Fifty bluejackets
from the United States warship and
fifty from the British vessels com
posed the guard of honor. With them
were about 200 friendly troops. The
procession was through the whole of
Apia, preceded by the band of the flag
ship. Lieutenant Miller had charge of
the function. The flagship and the
Porpoise both fired a royal salute of
twenty-one guns when the King's flag
was hoisted. The German Consul Gen
eral and Vice Consul were conspicuous
by their absence, and the Falke -lay in
the harbor as if she and her captain
had not the slightest interest in Sa
moa.
When Admiral Kautz arrived he
spent a few days making inquiries and
then called a meeting of all th^ Con
suls and the senior naval officers of the
warships in the harbor. Trie whole sit
uation was taken under advisement
and the outcome of the meeting was
the issuance of the proclamation of
March 11.
This proclamation was taken to
Mulinuu by Flag Lieutenant Miller of
the Philadelphia and Lieutenant Gaunt
of the Porpoise. It was read to Ma
taafa and his associated thirteen chiefs.
That night it was rumored around
Apia that German Consul Rose had de
nied that he was a consenting party
to this proclamation. On the same day
the proclamation was read to the
chiefs the Royalist had pone to the isl
and of Apolimax and returned with a
number of the deported Malietoanv
Mataafa and his chiefs, after receiving
the admiral's notice. haÂ«l quietly left
Mulinuu and gone to the western por
tion of the municipality, and it seemed
and was generally understood that
they were about to obey the command
and retire to their homes. They were
in Vaimoso when the German Consul
issued a counter proclamation in th*
Samoan language which was distrib
uted among the Mataafans. The im
mediate result of this act was that th\
rebpls blackened their, faces, seized
their rifles and patrolled the back
streets of the municipality, declaring
they would prevent any food supplies
being brought into Apia for the use of
the Malietoa natives.
On March 12, the following day. th*.
whole of Apia was rarrounded by the
Mataafan warriors. Admiral Kautz
had to provide for the safety of th*
returned Malietoa prisoners. They
were all marched to MuUnuu and a
guard composed of Phlladeiphj a and
P6rpolse men under the command of
Lieutenant Brown and Lieutenant Cave
took up a position at the neck of the
peninsula to protect them. A number
of the Malietoans had their rifles,
which had been in safe keeping on the
Porpoise, returned to them, and this,
in addition to the guard, made the
Mulinuu defense one of considerable
strength.
The morning of March 13 came and
there was no answer .from Mataafa.
His men had surrounded the town and
Admiral Kautz's command was ignored
completely. Under this state of affairs,
caused solely by the proclamation of
the German Consul, the admiral had
only two alternativesâ either to enforce
his command or to submit to Mataafa
and his German colleague. About mid
day Flag Lieutenant Miller set out on
horseback with an ultimatum to Ma
taafa, who was at Valmoso, inside the
municipality. He and Secretary Sel
lars of the flagship had only gone on
the main road to the first turning,
about haif a mile from the beach, when
PROCLAMATION.
Admiral Kautz Gives Notice to Mataafa
That He Is No Longer Chief.
To High Chief Mataafa and the thirteen chiefs associated with,
him, in particular, and to all the people of Samoa, both foreign and
native, in general.
1. Whereas, at a meeting held this day on boad the United
States flagship Philadelphia, at anchor in the harbor of Apia, at
which were present the consular representatives of the three signa
tory powers of the Berlin treaty of 1889, and the three senior naval
officers of the same powers, it was agreed that the so-called pro
visional government under High Chief Mataafa and thirteen other
chiefs can have no legal status under the Berlin treaty, and can
therefore not be recognized by tha consular and naval representa
tives, it is hereby ordered that the high chief and the thirteen other
chiefs aforesaid go quietly to their respective homes and obey the
laws of Samoa, and respect the Berlin treaty.
2. It is further ordered that all the chiefs and their people
who have been ejected from their homes and who have been sent to
different points in the Samoan Islands, return quietly to their afore
said homes without molestation.
3. The guarantee of protection as far as lies within the power
of the naval force now in this harbor, is given to all who quietly
obey this order. On the other hand, it will be used against all who
disregard it or the rights of quiet and peaceably disposed people.
4. The treaty of Berlin recognizes the Chief Justice of Samoa
as the highest officer under the existing government and as long as
he holds his office his authority must be respected and the decree of
the court must be carried out.
5. Trusting that all residents of Samoa will have the good
sense to observe the requirements of this proclamation, which is is
sued in the interests of peace and with the earnest regard for the
rights of all, both foreign and native, and that there may be no oc
casion to use military power to enforce it, I am. respectfully,
ALBERT KAUTZ,
Rear Admiral United States Navy, Commander in Chief U. S. Naval
Force on Pacific Station.

they were stopped by an armed Ma
taafa party. Their business was de
manded, and when the native leader
was informed they wished to see Ma
taafa, he curtly replied that no one
could see Mataafa, but if the officers
had any letter for him it would be de
livered and the officers could wait
where they were for an answer. Lieu
tenant Miller handed the ultimatum to
the chief and told him this letter re
quired no answer.
In Apia a force of fifty men had taken
up a position in the center of the town
next the courthouse, which was for the
time being' turned into a war office and
hospital. These- were Porpoise men un
der Lieutenant Cave. Twenty British
bluejackets under Lieutenant Gaunt
were installed at the British consulate.
Each party had a quick-firing machine
gun and a six-pound held piece. To the
west of Mulinuu and along the main
road was posted a force of fifty Ameri
cans under Lieutenant Landsdale. With
the guard at Mulinuu neck was a
twelve-pounder and a. Colt machine
gun. A party of Americans protected
the United Btates consulate under Lieu
tenant Perkins. They also had a ma
chine gun and field piece. British Con
sul Maxse and Lieutenant Miller on
horseback reconnoitered the back roads
of Apia. They met armed posts, but
were not interfered with in any way
pt once, when a rebel covered Lieu
tenant Miller with his rifle. The lieu
tenant was unarmed, but owing to the
prompt aid of the Consul and Mr.
Gaunt, who accompanied them, the
smalt party of natives broke and fled.
The report was quickly in town that
the Consul's party had been captured,
and bluejackets under Cave hastened
to the rescue. The report was untrue
and the Consul and lieutenant were met
riding home in safety.
Early next morning: notice was spread
that if no answer were received from
Mataafa by 1 o'clock the admiral's flag

PROCLAMATION.
Piece of Folly of the
German Consul That
Is Causing War.
By the proclamation of the
Admiral of the United States,
dated the 11th of March, was
made known that the three
Consuls 01 the signatory pow
ers of the Berlin treaty, as
well as the three commanders
of the men of war, had been
unanimous to no more recog
nize the provisional govern
ment composed of Mataafa
and the thirteen chiefs.
I therefore make known to
you that this proclamation
was not at all correct. I, the
German Consul General, con
tinue to recognize the pro
visional government of Samoa
until I have received contrary
instructions from my Gov
ernment. ROSE,

ship would fire one of her large guns,
followed by three-minute guns. No an
swer was sent. Mataafa, buoyed up by
German talk and vague hints of sup
port, defied the admiral. . The natives
were fully persuaded that the German
proclamation would have the effect of
deterring the admiral from opening fire
on them.
At the request of Admiral Kautz.
Captain Sturdee assumed command of
th<> combined forces on shore. Flas
Lieutenant Miller of the Philadelphia
assisting. Dr. Lung was at Mulinuu2
with his comrades from the flagship.
While these forces were taking up their
positions the whole of the native popu
lation of Apiaâ men. women and child-
ren â were streaming by order to Mu
linuu for safety and protection behind
the gallant bluejackets under Lieuten
ant Brown. General operations were,
of course, under the command of Ad
miral Kautz.
Af soon as the land forces were sta
tioned the Philadelphia opened nre by
throwing a shell Into the outskirts of
Apia. The Royalist followed with some
6-iQch shells. 'The Porpoise went outside
the harbor, and proceeding a couple of
miles down the coast bombarded the vil
lage of Vaimoso, where large numbers of
E were supposed to be. Some boats
were destroyed here, but all nativ.es tied
to the dense bush at the back. The accu
racy of the Porpoises firing was the
th^me of general admiration, both of
American and British officers. She is the
only ship of the attacking force which
powdi i . and her guns
make far less report than those of the
others.
The church at Vaimoso was smashed by
a shell and another tore away a portion
( f the veranda and house of the manager
of the German plantation at Vaitelt. The
wholt of the outskirts of Apia were
shelled from the harbor, about seventy
shells being fired before dusk, when firing

which is about - : . further to the
wes:.
During the bombardment no natives
were seen belonging to the Mataafa party.
Prior to the firing of the first gun by tho j
flagship a body of rebels very nearly sue- !
ceeded in capturing the British Consul I
and consulate. About a half hour before '
the first gun was tired a party of them
rushed UÂ£ to within thirty yards of the ;
building, but the guard was ready and !
stood tirm and the rebels retired precipi- j
tately. They evidently thought they
would have surprised the bluejackets. The
natives rired no shots, neither did the'
sailors, as orders had been issued by tho j
admiral. "No firing except fired on "until:
after the rim shell from the Philadel- ;
phia."
As soon as night fell the electric
searchlight began an incessant watch
along the fore shore. An attack under I
cover of darkness was expected, as it was
then easy tor an attacking force to come :
within a few score yards of the white '
forces without being discovered. The I
whole of Apia, with the exception of the :
immediate spots around houses, is cov
ered with banana patches and other :
dense vegetation, through which it is ;m- ,
possible to detect any one at a great di=
tance. At dusk the Britishers had a j
skirmish with the enemy close to the
Tivoli Hotel. Whether any rebels were
killed cannot be said, as it is the cus- i
tom of the Sampans to carry off their
dead and wounded from the field of bat- '
tit to save them from mutilation. Among
the --.moans any one captured by the
enemy, no matter how slightly he be â¢
wounded, is immediately decapitated ;
The captured head is taken in triumph i
to the leader of the successful band
Sentries were posted all along the main
street, and no one was allowed to go :
about without a pass. Cp to 2 o'clock
on the morning of March 14 all was dark
and quiet as far as any attack was con-.
cerned. From different points volleys \
were fired at spots where the rebels were
thought to be lying, and the field guns '
and Nordenfeldte poured forth tneir
deadly charge. Firing was heard at Ma
tantu in the direction of the consulates
and a little later, abo 2:30 a. m., a rush
was made by some rebels on the <Mjard '
by the Tivpli. Sharp firing ensued, and
lour British were shot: two dead and
two were wounded. One of the latter
has since died. From this time until
daylight an attack was hourly expected
but nont came. At the request of tne ;
British , a Maxim gun was sent from tne
Philadelphia to the" British consulate"
and with it some men to work it. There
may now be seen combined forces of '
British and , Americans guarding the
British Consul.
On March 15 Mullnuu was strengthened
by earthworks and trenches, and a large
space was cleared of tne dense man
grove bush, which was growing up to
within a score of yards of the American
position. A body of 300 Malietoana had
their rifles returned to them from the
Porpoise, and rendered good service t>v
clearing brush and scrub at various por
tions of the township. After the Mataata
success of January 1 the rebels burned
all the native houses in the central por
tion of Apia which belonged to Maaetpa
people, it was now decided necessary
to burn the rebel village of Vaiala. be"
hind the two consulates, as the shelter
of the houses there enabled the rebels to
approach to within 100 yards of the con
sulate.
The German warship Falke was a: i
â  with dispa â 
to serve German interests. She had
tually taken, a large quantity of Sour on
board and several head of cattie when
Admiral Kautz became aware of her in
tend-d departure.
"Where are you going?" inquired the
admiral.
'â¢To the harbor of Saluafata," was the
response.
Saluafata is twelve miles to the east of
Apia, and one of Mataafa's strongest !
towns is there. It is here German war
snips are accustomed to stay during their
absence from Apia.
. "Stay where you are and be ready to
afford refuge to your own countrymen
in the time of danger," was the ad- i
miral s rejoinder.
So. on the day following the first fight- !
ing the Falke was crowded with German
families. It was noticeable that the Ger
mans had. at the signal, congregated 1
at Soki. where the premises of the Ger
man firm are. but had noT sought shel
ter on the vessels. No doubt this was !
owing to the idea that the admiral was !
only playing a game of bluff, and also '
to the idea that, the Germans being
friendly to Mataafa. their property would
be respected by the rebels. I
During Thursday. March 16, matters ;

whom had had no sleep for forty-eight

lowed him to go on the FaJke on receiv- I
ing the word of honor of the German can- '
tain that he would not be allowed to de- i

shown on account of the dangerous Illness

Mataafa sympathizer. Moors himself is
confined to his own store and is allowed

backed up the German tales to Mataafa
and is directly responsible for much of the
harm. Â«
During Friday night. March 17. there
was some exceedingly annoying shooting
done by a small party, possibly one or
two, and strongly suspected of btins a
couple of Germans. They fired at the
searchlight of the Porpoise. Fortunate
ly no harm was done, but the ship was
struck several times. The firing seemed
to come from the direction of a store
owned by a Frenchman (Lotofie), a strong
Mataafa man. Next afternoon a raid was
made on the store by the British and sev
enteen rifles were found.

their movements. The Fourth Cavalry
and two guns were out all the morning
in the direction of Bairasoain, a little
north of Malolos.
In the meantime the dredgers are
busy clearing the channel of the Rio
Grande to Pampagua.
The United States double-turreted
monitor Monadnock is patrolling the

the rebels in motion and dropping oc
casional shells among them in response
to their musketry fire.

KAUTZ BITTER TOWARD
THE GERMAN CONSUI
APIA. Samoa, March 24.â 1 had an in
terview with Ailmiral Kautz yesterday.
He spoke quite freely on the situation,
and considers he has been grossly in
sulted by the German Consul General is
puing his counter proclamation. The
admiral takes the stand that the Berlin
treaty, which he Is instructed by his Gov
ernment to uphold, does not make any
provision whatever for a provisional gov
ernment. His instructions are to carry
out the treaty in accordance with the
views of a majority of the consular rep
resentatives. The admiral is very angry
with the German Consul, and blames him
entirely for the present attitude of the
rebels, as the" natives were obeying his
command to retire to their homes when
the German proclamation was issued.
At the meeting of the Consuls and sen
ior naval officers on the flagship the ad
miral explained his position. Lnder the
treaty there could be no provisional gov
ernment, and the agreement under which
it had been recognized under peculiar
and trying circumstances for the protec
tion of life *nd property was just as pro
visional as the government itself. He
had to stand by the Supreme Court, and
he hoped that a plan of action would
be agreed upon for restoring peace to the '
island without the intervention of armed I
force. The British and American Con- â 
suis and naval officers agree with the j
admiral. The German Consul said that I
having accepted the provisional govern
or couid not recede from his posi
tion under any circumstances whatever
until he had instructions from Berlin.
Later after the meeting. Rose nut his
views in writing to the admiral and sanJ
German warships could act only if Ger
man property or life were to be pro
tected against danger or in the case of
the Supreme Court issuing a warrant tor
arrest against individuals. On no other
ground could German warships interfere
in Samoa, and according to instructions
under which he acted there would be no
military interference by Germany. He
also protested against the issuing" of the
proclamation by Admiral Kautz pending
instructions from the treaty powers; also
against the return to Apia of the de
ported Malietoans. which was a m>
to the peace of Samoa, and he renri:
the admiral that the FalÃe had v.
roralM to help acenrdins: to th< ad
miral's proclamation. He v\i> afraid the
admiral's proclamation would do harm,

and that already people were afraid of

The admiral replied that he must be
governed in his actions I Ictlon
of his duty and not by his f-'-ars. That in
his proclamation he meant exa< tly what
he said and was not speaking flippantly,
and what he had pro> .-laimej he would
do. The fact that with all his â¢
spondi to the admiral
the German Consul did not consider it
->ary to forward a copy of his coun
ter proclamation to th< admiral had not
increased th> feeling between the
admiral and the Consul. Never bef â¢
rficial had the admiral been treated
in such an uncourterius and insulting;
manner. In conclusion thi admiral said
he did not intend to be bulldozed by any
German Consul, and he didn't intend to
lose any sleep over the matter.

INCIDENT THAT ADDED
TO AMERICAN PRESTIGE
Louis Janin Jr.. a well-known California
and Nevada mining man. had an exciting
experience at Samoa while returning on
the Mariposa to San Francisco from the
Antipodes. In common with his fellow
passengers, Mr. Janin was naturally anx
ious to go ashore and view the ravages
caused by the native war.
"I was landed." he said yesterday, "at
! the International Hotel at the Muhnmi end
iof the town. I found the place garrisoned
like a military post, as it was the head
quarters of the landing party from the
Philadelphia. At last we got a pass from
j Lieutenant Lansdale, the officer in charge,
i allowing me to walk along the beach road
I as far as the Supreme Court. Everywhere
j we found signs of ruin and desertion. The
stores were closed and no whites were
about. As to the natives, they had all
disappeared. The Mataafa rebels had
fled into the bush behind the town, where
they were being shelled by the men-of-
I war. The loyal followers of Malietoa
Tanu. the young King who was crowned
just before our arrival, were intrenched
on the Mulinuu peninsula. Armed sailors
from the Philadelphia patroliecT the roads
and it was not safe to venture more than
a few yards inland. We tried to explore
one of the side paths leading from the
beach to a native village, but were speed
ily confronted by a half-naked savage and
an ug!y looking rifle. He seemed to mean
business, so we retired.
"At the Tivoli Hotel we came under
British care and had to get another pass.
Everywhere there was the greatest
friendship and camaraderie between Eng
lish and Americans, but nowhere couui
the Germans be seen. In fact, the Ger
mans were practically prisoners on board
the Falke or in their own stores, for th-v
could not get passes to proceed along the
beach.
"The charges for the Philadelphia V -\
inch guns proved in many cases defective.
The powder was either weak in explosive
effect or else hung fire to such an extent
as to destroy the aim of the gun. In
some instances the shells burst prema
turely, one striking the American con
sulate and wounding a marine. As the
result of this. Admiral Kautz decided to
go outside one day and thoroughly test
his ammunition.
"This action Led to a ludicrous blun
der, though it told entirely in favor of
the Americans. The German warship
Falke happened to be outside on th>
.-arm- day.- and when the Americans
opened fire the natives jiaturally <_on
d thai war between tile nations had
begun. As the F.'ilke returned to port
!Irst. they also assumed that she had
been ignominiously driven back b>- the
United States cruiser. T*He prestige of
our nation gained immensely by this
little unrehearsed incident. The Ameri
can sailors are very popular with the
loyal natives, and the presence of a pow
erful cruiser like the Philadelphia has
â  onvlnced them that the United States
B a power !â > be counted with. German
influence has been correspondingly di
minishing, for the failure of the Germans
to cany out their promise of protection
to Mataafa. and the inaction of the Falke

Among the passengers by the Manposa
was James MacMahOn, one of the lead
leatrical managers in Australia. Mr.
dabon comes t" this country in con
on with stage business, but prefers
the details of his mission
at present. While at Apia he took the
the scene of war. and
a vivid picture of the terrible con
dition ot this once flourishing little town.
"The only hotel open." he said, "was
the International, which Is the head
"iiiarters of the American officers from
the Philadelphia. We were only allowed
to pass along the beach road by special
permit, and then in company with a
strong gruard. All the stores were de
serted, and Mataafa'e men had fled to
the bush behind the town, where they
had l>e<-n shelled by the warships only
the day before. The white population
had sought refuge at the mission, or
on hoard the warships. There were 200
refugees on board the Royalist at one
time, but the overcrowding led to such
an unsanitary condition of affairs that
The Europeeans had to be landed. The
British ships Porpoise and Royalist, the
United States cruiser Philadelphia and
nnan Falke were in port.
"Just before we left the British cruiser
Tauraoga came steaming in through the
reef at full speed, and brought up close
to the Philadelphia. Her officers told
me that she had come full speed all the
:rom Tougas under special orders.
It was a magnificent display of naviga
tion as the great ship made her way
through the crowded harbor.
"MaJietoa Tami was crowned King the
day :â â¢â¢â¢ we left, and now that
there are so many war vessels in port It
is not expected there will be any more
â¢ with the natives. The Germans
are kept closely on board their ships or
in the German consulate, where many
have- taken refuge, so that they have no
opportunity to make further trouble."
ENGLAND ANNEXES
THE TONGA ISLANDS
NUKUALOFA. Tonga. Dec. 13, IS9S.â
Quite a ripple of excitement is prevailing
in this Rip Van Winkle place, caused by
the appearance of H. M. S. Tauronga
last Tuesday. The captain at once
called on his Majesty. George Tubou. and
it soon leaked out that something very se
rious was in the wind.
About three months ago Herr Gruno,
the German Vice Consul at Samoa, ar
rived and made a demand on the Tongan
Government for claims amounting to
Â£23.000 for debts contracted by Tongans
with the German traders. Many of these
accounts are of over twenty years' stand
ing and the Government repudiated the
claims.
Mr. Gruno left for Samoa and rumor
had it that unless the full amount were
paid Germany Intended to seize You You,
the best harbor in the group and the
largest one in the South Pacific, outside
of Papeete harbor in Tahiti.
Herr Gruno returned to Samoa and a
German warship was expected here later
to enforce the claim. The Tauronga
sailed from Sydney at a few hours' no
tice under sealed orders to Fiji, where
the captain and Governor were closeted
for several hours, and the Touronga
steamed here as fast as her engines could
propel her. To-day the captain r^main^d
with the King for three hours, and the
British protectorate will be hoisted at 9
o'clock to-morrow. The Tauronga has on
board Â£25.000 to pay Germany, as Great
Britain assumes the claim just.

Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, March 4.â A Cavite special
to Freedom, dated February 24, givesthe
first story of .the capture of San Rogue,
in which California artillery played a
part, as follows:
The burning of Sun Rogue and the
! complete routing of the insurgent Gen-
I eral Astrillia and his army of about
! on February 8 was a complete success,
arid much credit is due to the lowa In
fantry and California and Nevada Ar
tillery for the quick and effective man
ner in which the work was accomplished.
General Astrillia had been warned that
he must raise a white flag over his head
quarters and lay down his arms by 9
o'clock on the morning of the Bth or
our forces would bombard and take the
city. No one expected that he would
surrender, and it was with some surprise
that shortly before the appointed time
one of the largest white flags yet brought
i into service was hoisted over the insur
fent blockhouse. Colonel Lopez of ttie
owa regiment, who is in command here.
! and his advisors, put but little confidence
; in the faith of the insurgents, however.
! and instead of sending only a few men
! over to treat with the insurgent leaders ,
I the forces were at once made ready for
an attack.
It was well that no faith was placed in
the flag of truce, for as soon as the
I treacherous insurgents siw that our
; forces were not going to fall into their
trap they poured out of the hidden rifle-
Eit where they had been stationed and
egan to apply the torch to every build-
I ing in their reach, hoping in this manner
! to delay the advance of the American
i forces long enough to allow them to re
: treat, which plan worked successfully, as
1 it was some time before it was safe to
1 start in pursuit, and even then the Sec
i ond and Third battalions of the Wyoming
i boys, with their beautiful three-inch
pieces, could get no further than the
causeway, as their guns were too heavy
to allow them to make the speed neces
i sary to carry them through the mass of
â  burning and falling buildings upon every
hand. So to the lowan* and Californians
I alone was left the task of driving off the
, insurgents and preventing any further
' spread of the conflagration. The lowans.
consisting of Companies E. C, L, M, G,
I I. B and K. under command of Majors
; Hume and Moore, respectively, and Bat
-1 teries A and D of the California Artil
; lr-ry. armed with Springfields and several
, small gatlings. gave chase. It was
j through a raging furnace that they
i charged and right well did they do their
i duty.
The eight companies of lowans de
i ployed so as to form a complete line
across the town, and then onward through
> the burning city they pressed, closely fol
lowed by the artillerymen under Major
Rice. Up one street they would go, only
to find it blocked with burning ruins, then
down another, where perhaps they might
â¢ get through, though often compelled to
; retire to the coast and plunge into the bay
' to their waist in order to pass burning
obstructions the fleeing insurgents had
! erected to cover their hasty retreat.
For about five miles through fire and
water our forces pushed onward, when
they were halted and a camp prepared.
which camp is now our outpost and has
been thoroughly intrenched, and is now
defended by the Third Battalion of the
: lowans. part of Batteries A and D of the
; California and Battery A of the Nevada
. Artillery and Troop A of the Nevada
Cavalry, the Second Battalion of lowa
bfing ordered back to Cavite. which city
they now hold, the Fiist Battalion having
been ordered to Manila to do duty on the
outposts there.
. There was no loss of life on our side.
though one of the lowa boys *was badly
; cut by a knife in the hands of a sneak
ing native, whose life paid the penalty
for the cowardly attempt he made. It
is not known what the insurgent loss
was. but as several are known to have
i fallen before the deadly Springfields
! while engaged in their hellish work of
1 spreading the fires, and many charred
< remains have been found in the ruins,
while several bodies have since been dis
i covered in the woods near the outpost,
; it is thought that their loss was consld
; erable.
This is the first opportunity the lowa
boys have had to show their skill, but
from the way they did their duty during
this dangerous day it is safe to say that
| if ever given a chance they will prove
i themselves worthy the good name they
: bear.

WAR OF RACES
ON A PLANTATION
NEAR HONOLULU
Japanese Jlttaek, Chinese, Killing
Tfcree and Wounding
.Many.
HONOLULU, March 27.-The Marshal and the Honolulu police wew
called to Kahuku yesterday by the most serious racial outbreak that
has ever occurred on the islands. Two hundred and fifty Japanese
laborers of the Kahuku plantation, crudely but heavily armed, made
a sudden foray upon the unsuspecting Chinese laborers of the planta
tion, who with their wives and children were spending the leisure of the day
in their own quarters. The attack was premeditated, organized and sudden.
The Japanese had sent their women and children to the mill and other
places of safety. Moving out of their own quarters suddenly and in a body,
they caught the. Chinese at a disadvantage, killing three of them, fatally
injuring two or three more, wounding a large number and driving the re
mainder in a panic to the canefields.
The trouble between the Chinese and Japanese at Kahuku has been
brewing for some time, but did not reach a serious crisis untii yesterday.
It was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon when this large party of Japanese
visited the Chinese quarters and began the assault. The Japanese were
armed with what are known as spiked.clubs. knives, axes and various other
weapons. It is said not one of the Chinamen had anything to fight with
and the entire party was helpless.
In the fight which ensued three Chinamen were beaten to death and
twelve were badly wounded. Some forty or fifty were slightly wounded.
As soon as the alarm had spread to the plantation Manager Weight
and a number of the lunas rushed to the quarters. After considerable dif
ficulty they succeeded in staying the fight and then drove the Japanese
back to their own camp. At the same time the affair was reported to the
Marshal. Shortly after 9 o'clock Minister Cooper, Marshal Brown, Prose
cuting Attorney A. L. C. Atkinson, ten mounted police and a squad of foot
police started for the scene on a special train.
The first work of the Marshal at Kahuku was to institute a martial
law system on a small scale. Guards were placed here and there to pre
vent the belligerents getting together again. With the thirty men from
town there were several from Waialua, as well as the police from Koolau,
making in all about fifty-five officers. The night was spent locating the
Chinese, many of whom had fled, and getting the men known to have been
in the fight into places where they could be guarded. Both camps, it is un
derstood, were surrounded as soon as the Marshal's party reached the scene.
Just before daylight a Coroner's jury was impaneled to investigate the
killing of the three Chinese. Numerous witnesses, nearly all Chinese, were
examined. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the men were
murdered.
From the evidence adduced at the Coroner's hearing and other indica
tions gathered during the progress of the investigation, twenty-three Jap
anese were arrested and were brought to the city on a special train this
afternoon. They were believed to be the ringleaders. As before stated the
twelve Chinese who were so badly injured are also on the special train, com
ing to the hospital for treatment. Two or more of them may not survive
their wounds.
There were at the camps, most of whom were mixed up in the fight. 300
Chinamen and 225 Japanese. Both of the Chinese camps were surrounded
by the Japanese at the start of the row and fighting went on at both
places.
There are in the jailed party twenty-three Japanese and seventeen
Chinese. The latter are all more or less injured and are here for treat
ment. They will be taken care of at the hospital at the prison. All the
Japanese are believed to have been principals in the fight of Sunday after
noon. Three men in the party are thought to have been the instigators and
generals of the massacre.
No charges have yet been preferred against any of the men. The case
of each will be thoroughly investigated. It probably will be a week before
accusations will be preferred. In the meantime the men will be held under

PREMATURE PLAN
TO LYNCH MOORE
NEVADA CITY, April 7.âExcite
ment ran high here this morning
when a report reached Sheriff
Getchell from Chief of Police
Gall of Stockton that a man an
swering Outlaw Moore's description
was under surveillance there. The
fact that Farmer Nettleship and others
in the vicinity of Auburn had repeated
ly and persistently said they had seen
a man answering the fugitive's descrip
tion journeying southward on Tuesday
morning lent color to the suspicions of
Chief of Police Gall, and Sheriff Get
chell left on the noon train for the mill
city. Before Getchell had crossed the
boundary of the county a dispatch
flashed across the wire from Stockton
which exploded the story and soon the
excitement subsided.
The report of the arrest of the sus
pect tn Stockton quickly spread about
town and before noon groups of men
had gathered on the street corners and
HPrlously discussed plans to lynch the
murderer In the event of his being
brought to town.
Despite the fact that there Is a grow
ing belief that Moore has succeeded in
getting well out of the county, Joe Kil
roy still holds to the theory that his
brother's slayer is secreted In the
mountains close to Nevada City. In
support of his belief Kilroy gives many
plausible theories.
"Moore is a natural woodsman and

possible. Once he leaves the moun

ask for food at a tavern or farm house.
He is very deaf and will have to use

speaks to him. His deafness alone
would betray him. Moore is a shrewd,

that he has not got the chance of an

mountains. He knows the country up

BUYS NITJLII PLANTATION.
HONOLULU, March 31.âHenry Water
house has purchased Niulli plantation
The deal, which has been pending for
some weeks, was closed late yesterday af
ternoon. Niulli is a plantation in full
blast. The crop of cane is now being
ground, and sugar is shipped out every
flay. There is an immediate profit to the
investor, which places the scheme on a
different basis to anything In the Islands
save the stock of the older plantations,
which is now very high.
The plantation will be Incorporated next
week at $2,000,000, divided into 100,000
shares of $20 each. All will be paid. There
will be no assessable stock. WaLerhouse
& Co. take $1,000,000 themselves, another
party takes $2'j0,000, and other big trans
fers will leave a small margin to be of

Niulii is the plantation of Judge C. F.

In the Superior Court, to-day, decided on

1889 appropriated $45,569 47 to pay for the
maintenance of the asylum during the
thirty-ninth and fortieth fiscal years.
There remained of this appropriation a
balance of $7450 C 5, which the trustees
claim belong-s to the asylum fund. Col
gran maintained that it should be re
turned to the State treasury and sued for
an order to that effect. The trustees de
murred principally on the ground that the
statute of limitations barred the action.
Judge Hughes decided that this statute
did not operate in a suit filed by one
branch of the State government against
another.

derer of Kilroy.
STOCKTON, April 7.â Sheriff Get

Nevada City. His presence is the re
sult of a conference he had to-day over
the telephone with Chief of Police Gall.
The chief did not suggest that Getchell
was needed, but on the information he
received Getchell felt justified in aban
doning his search in the vicinity of
Nevada City and coming to Stockton.
For the last two days the officers
have had under constant espionage a
man who bears a striking resemblance
to Moore, even to his deafness and
characteristic manner of conducting
himself. They became so interested in
the man that this afternoon Chief Gall
concluded to ask Getchell for further
particulars.
The suspect appeared in this vicinity
last Sunday, remaining in the city a
day or so, when he came under the ob
servation of the officers. He is now
located a short distance from the city,
but any move on his part that would
look like flight would result in his
prompt arrest. Sheriff Getchell to
night is engaged in investigating the
suspect's actions, and before the sun
is high to-morrow he will have had a
look at the man.
WAVE-WASHED ON
A CAPSIZED BOAT
Twenty Hours' Struggle
for Life.
Special IMspateh to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. April 7.â
Charles Webber, a German, of Nanai
mo, B. C, arrived here this morning
after having passed through an experi
ence such as falls to the lot of few men.
For twenty hours he was washed by
waves of the gulf while clinging for
life on top of his capsized craft, and he
saw his young companion drown before
his eyes.
Webber started from Nanaimo last
Monday In a small yacht with William
Reid. At 6 o'clock in the evening Reid,
who was at the helm, ran the craft
upon a reef at Yellow Point, Vancouver
Island, far from a human habitation.
The bottom of the yacht heaved up and
soon the two men were up to their arm
pits in water. The vessel commenced
pounding and Reid, against the advice
of Webber, lashed himself to the mast.
For six hours the men were washed
by the waves, the boat keeping an up
right position. Then the little vessel
turned keel uppermost, and while Web
ber was thrown to one side his mate
plunged into the sea on the other.
When Webber got a position on the
bottom of his craft he saw Reid strug
gling In the water two arms-lengths
away. He could not reach him and he
saw the lad sink before his eyes, crying
out a farewell to his mother in Eng
land.
A terrible experience followed for
Webber. It was midnight when he saw
poor Reid drown, and shortly after
ward he saw a steamer's lights some
distance away. He yelled himself
hoarse, but got no reply. The breakers
then rolled over his craft and twice he
was washed from his position. He
fought desperately for life, and, al
though half dead from cold and ex
haustion, held on to the boat.
At 8 o'clock Tuesday morning he saw
another steamer pass and frantically
signaled her, only to be again disap
pointed. It was noon on Tuesday when
he saw the first human being. He had
given up all hope, and, he says, was
about to let himself drop into the sea,

THREE RAILWAY MEN
SUMMONED BY DEATH
WOODLAND. April 7. -One of the
queerest superstitions among: railroad
men is that one fatality among the em
ployes is almost immediately followed by
two others before the "hoodoo" is broken.
Henry Florian Black was a brakeman and
John Alfred Huber a telegraph operator,
and both were residents of Yolo County
They were lifelong acquaintances and
both were employed on this division
Young Huber was taken ill on Sunday and
lived only four days. Black was confined
to his bed but five days. Both died in
Sacramento on the same day and at the
same hour, and on Thursday their bodies
were side by side in the same undertak
ing parlor.
Those coincidences set the railroad men
to discussing the old superstition, and
there were many gloomy conjectures as to
where on the division death would make
a third visitation. They were not kept
long in suspense. This morning R. L
Dunlap, a brakeman on the Redding
freight train, met a violent death. While
engaged in uncoupling cars at Conant's
switch, near Red Bluff, he stumbled and
fell, and before he could recover the
wheels of a car were upon him. He was
killed instantly.
Scurvy Epidemic Abating.
SEATTLE, April 7.â The steamer Ex
celsior arrived to-night from Copper
River, Alaska, with fifty passengers.
They report that the scurvy epidemic was
abating. There were nineteen cases in
the hospital at Copper Center and ten in
various cabins in that vicinity. There had
been no deaths or new cases reported re
cently. The body of Rudolph TSllerkamn
of Louisville, Ky., who was one of the
party of six who perished on the Valdes
Glacier on February 27, was brought
down.

THIRTEEN PERSONS
PERISHED IN THE
NEW YORK FIRE
Twelve of the Victims in the An=
drews Dwelling and One in
the Adams Abode.
NEW YORK, April 7.â The fire which
early this morning destroyed the hand
some residence of Wallace C. Andrews
at 2 East Sixty-seventh street also
burned to death twelve*persons sleeping
in the house.
Firebrands carried by the wind were
blown into an open window in the home
of Albert J. Adams, 3 East Sixty-ninth
street, two blocks distant, setting fire
to the house and causing the death of
a servant. All of the thirteen bodies
have been recovered. The dead are:
WALLACE C. ANDREWS, president
of the New York Steam Heating Com
pany.
MRS. WALLACE C. ANDREWS,
wife of the above.
MRS. GEORGIANA BOYDEN ST.
JOHN, wife of Mrs. Andrews' brother,
Gamaliel C. St. John, an officer ol the
New York Steam Heating Company.
ORSON ST. JOHN, aged 7 years.
WALLACE ST. JOHN, aged 3 years.
FREDERICK ST. JOHN, aged 13
months.
NELLIE BOLAND, servant.
MARY FLANAGAN, servant.
EVA PETERSON, servant.
KATE DOWNING, servant.
MARIE ROTH, servant.
ANNIE CARY, servant.
In the Adams fire:
MRS. MARY LAUOHLIN, aged 50
years, housekeeper, died from suffoca
tion and burns.
Alice White, cook, and Jennie Burns,
laundress, the only inmates of the An
drews house who escaped, are in the
hospital in a serious condition.
The list of injured at the Adams fire is:
Mrs. Isabella Adams, wife of Albert J.
Adams, injured in the back, burned, suf
fering- from shock; Nellie Quinn, ser
vant, jumped from fourth floor to an ex
tension, severe bruises; Evelyn Adams,
burns, shock; Minnie Bogue, servant,
sprained ankle and bruises; Jerry
Blazin, fireman Engine Company 44, con
tusion of the back; Mary . Malloy, leg
fractured, shock; William Stevenson,
bruises and contusions.
Whether the fire started from an ex
plosion of a lamp or of gas has not yet
been determined, but when it was first
discovered at 2 o'clock this morning the
flames seemed to burst from all parts of
the house at once.
Policeman McKnight was at Fifth ave
nue and Sixty-sixth street when he heard
an explosion and saw the glare of flames
in Sixty-seventh street. He ran with all
haste to the spot and found tongues of
flames leaping from, the upper windows
of the Andrews house and half-way
across the street. He tried to break in
the door and arouse the tenants, but was
driven back by the flames. Not waiting
any longer than to arouse the family of
the Rothschilds in the adjoining house,
No. 4, he sent in an alarm.
When the firemen arrived they -went
through the Rothschild house and man
aged to get in the rear rooms of the third
floor of the Andrews home, where they
found Mrs. St. John and her three-yeiJr
old son Wallace unconscious on the floor,
their night-clothes almost burned off.
They were quickly taken into the Roths
child house. Mrs. St. John died within
a few minutes. Her child died in the
fireman's arms.
The firemen made repeated efforts to
NAMES FOR THE
NEW WARSHIPS
Made by the
President.
Special IMspateh to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â The Presi
dent to-day named the twelve new war
ships recently provided by Congress as
follows:
Battleshipsâ Pennsylvania, New Jer
sey and Georgia.
Armored cruisers â West Virginia,
Nebraska, California.
Cruisersâ Denver, Dcs Molnes, Chat
tanooga, Galveston, Tacoma, Cleveland.
Petitions by the hundreds have been
flowing into the White House and Navy
Department ever since the new ships
were provided for, urging the merits of
various names. The President and Sec
retary Long enjoyed the good-natured
rivalry, and in making the final deter
mination consideration was given not
only to the urgency of the influence
brought to bear, but also to the several
sections of the country. Pennsylvania
petitioned through Governor Stone,
Senators Quay and Penrose and the en
tire delegation in the House of Repre
sentatives.
Georgia did not petition the Navy De
partment, and it is believed that the
choice of a Southern State was due to
a desire of the President to compliment
those with whom he visited on his re
cent Southern trip.
Senator Elkins and the entire Con
gressional delegation were most active
for West Virginia; Representative Mer
cer also made it his business to besiege
the Navy Department with petitions
for Nebraska.
The choice of California also seems
to be a personal compliment without
the same effort shown in other States.
The same rivalry was shown among the
cities, Mayors, City Councils, Chambers
of Commerce, etc., joining in the pleas.
The battleships Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Georgia are described in the
act authorizing them as follows:
"Three seagoing, coastline battle
ships, carrying the heaviest armor and
most powerful ordnance for vessels of
their class upon a trial displacement of
about 13,500 tons, to be sheathed and
coppered and to have the highest prac
ticable speed and great radius of ac
tion, and to cost, exclusive of armor
and armament, not exceeding $3,600,000
each."
The armored cruisers are similarly
described, except that they are to cost
$4,000,000 each and are to have a dis
placement of 12,000 tons.
The cruisers Denver, Cleveland and
others are described as "protected
cruisers" of about 2500 tons displace
ment, to be sheathed and coppered and
to have the highest speed compatible
with good cruising qualities, great
radius of action and to carry the most
powerful ordnance suited to vessels of
their class and to cost, exclusive of
armament, not exceeding $1,141,800 each.
LAWYEB O'DONNEIiIi GUILTY.
Convicted of Having Aided a Pris-
oner to Break From Jail.
MODESTO, April Xâ The jury in the
<*ase of T. S. P'Donnell. charged with hav
ing assisted & prisoner to escape, brought
in a verdict of guilty to-night, with a
recommendation of mercy. O'Donnell was
the attorney for James Phillips, a horse
thief, who sawed his way out of jail in
August, 1897, but was captured two days
later. O'Donnell fled, but returned and
surrendered last November
get into the other rooms, but they might
as well have attacked a furnace. The
building if saturated with oil could hardly
have burned more fiercely. Like most
large New York dwellings, it was high
and narrow and encased on two sides by
solid brick walls and the effect was like
a great chimney. The flames roared and
crackled and shot into the air a distance
of a hundred feet or more, throwing a
great fiery spray over the roofs of the
surrounding nouses.
All efforts to arouse the inmates in time
to save themselves were fruitless, and
aside from Mr. St. John the only other
persons who got out of the house alive
were the two servants, Jennie Burns and
Alice White, who appeared at the upper
windows terror-stricken and, heedless of
the cries of the firemen that they would
raise ladders and save them, jumped.
Jennie Burns leaped out first. She
turned over and over and fell almost di
rectly upon her head. Her skull was frac
tured in several places. The other woman,
when she saw the fate of her friend, hes
itated for a moment, then, as the smoke
thickened, she too jumped. She fell upon
a rear extension of the building and was
picked up unconscious and severely in- '
jured.
"While the fire in the Andrews House
was raging great clouds of sparks were
carried with the wind and a brand flew
into an open upper window of the home j
of Albert J. Adams. It caught in a cur
tain and instantly the room was ablaze.
A servant at the window is thought to
have been Mary Laughlin, for her dead
body was found later. Tightly clasped
in hf>r arms was the family pet dog.
"When the Adams house caught fire a
number of the policemen and firemen
gained an entrance and got the Adams
family out without serious injury. The I
servants were frantic in their efforts to
escape, and Mary Malloy and Minnie
Bogue jumped from the rear of the fourth
floor to the extension, from which they
were taken down.
lillie Quinn was cut off at the fourth
â¢, and, appearing at a front window,
her hanrl over her eyes and jumped,
he thought to the ground, but instead
ed on the roof of the bow window,
story below, and lay there stunned,
cemen Louis C. Wagner, Mclnerney
Hillman saw the woman's peril, and^
ling into the house at No. 5, went to
the fourth floor. Wagner was held by the
heels, and made a thrilling rescue. The
firemen managed to confine the fire in
this house to the third and fourth floors.
About 6 o'clock the firemen had suf
ficient mastery over the fire to permit of
a search of the Andrews house. They
found the bodies of two of the remaining
St. John children and the bodies of what
are thought to be the two servants, Marie
Roth and Kate Downing. At 11:15 o'clock
the firr-men found Mr. Andrews' body. Tt
wasl/badly burned and parts of thelegs
werl missing. The workers in the debris
found a body which was identified later
by a dentist as that of Mrs. Andrews.
At various other times before 5 o'clock
the workers found the charred remains of
four more persons, probably the servants.
Two of them were identified as the bodies
of Eva Peterson and Marie Roth.
Mr. St. John arrived in New York at 3
| o'clock this afternoon over the Pennsyl
vania Railroad. He^went at once to his
; home, perfectly ignorant of the reasons
which caused the sudden summons to
New York, and when he saw the ruins
of his house and was told of the horrible
fate of his wife and three children he bore
! up manfully, thoupgh it was apparent
I that he had to summon all his strength of
i will to do it.
BEEF CONDEMNED
BY THE OFFICERS
Canned and Fresh Unfit
for Rations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON,- April 7.â The army
Beef Inquiry Court decided to-day to ad
mit as evidence the official reports of
army officers concerning the beef sup
plied to the army during the war with
Spain, as requested by General Miles.
The public forenoon session of the court
was only of sufficient duration to permit
the preferment of this request. Majob
Lee stated that he considered it impor
tant that the matter should be definitely
determined as soon as possible. He also
asked for consideration of General Miles
supplementary request that a large num
ber of additional witnesses be sum
moned.
It was learned that all the reports were
brief and that the court in secret session
decided to allow them to be read. There
are 147 of them and they were generally
prepared by their authors after the close
of the campaigns in Cuba and Porto Rico
and in response to a circular letter.
With reference to the application to
have more witnesses called, it is under
stood that the court will adhere to its
determination not to summon any of the
list whose testimony would be merely cor
roborative of that already given.
At the afternoon session Major Lee read the
reports, all of which pertained to canned beet.
Brigadier General Vlele pronounced the can
ned beef "a miserable apology for food."
A large number of reports were made from
officers of the First Carvalry, among these the
following: â¢
Major James M. Bell â It is better than no
beef, but I cannot recommend it as a compo
nent of the field ration.
Lieutenant dough Overtonâ lt is an undesir
able portion of the travel ration.
Major W. b. Scottâ l heard no complaint of
the canned roast beef.
Lieutenant C. B. Williamsâ The beef as an
occasional substitute for bacon was acceptable.
Lieutenant Walter M. Whitmanâ The pro
longed issue of the beef on the transport was
injurious to the men.
Lieutenant F. M. I>avls considered the beef
as of poor quality and said he had found mag
gots cooked with the beef in the cans.
Lieutenant H. P. Berkeleyâ No more unpal
atable article of food could be Issued.
Lieutenant W. C. Riversâ lt was an unsuit
able article of food.
Lieutenant E. S. Wrightâ lt was a distinct
failure.
Lieutenant Colonel \^ Rafferty of the Second
Cavalry stated that he^greed with the report
of his commissary officer, who pronounced the
beef non-nutritive and said the men soon tired
of It. A large number nf office* In this regi
ment pronounced a similar vermct.
Major Jackson of the Third Cavalry pro
nounced the quality of the beef used in can
ning poor. It had served very well In hashes,
but as a separate article of food it was nauseat
ing.
Lieutenant Colonel Carroll of the Sixth Cav
alry said that most of the meat Issued to his
troops on the transport had been thrown over
board, as it made some of the men sick.
Captain West of the Sixth Cavalry had pre
ferred gciinK without meat to eating the canned
beef. It made his men sick.
Lieutenant R. B. Paddockâ Men would go
hungry rather than eat it.
Captain G. 8. Grimes, Second Artilleryâ The
meat was soft, watery and unsatisfactory to
the men.
Captain Ellis of the Fourth Artilleryâ lt was
stringy and tough and I and others found it un
palatable.
Captain Walter L. Finley of the Ninth Cav
alryâThe beef was tough an i devoid of flavor.
Captain M. G. Hughes, Ninth Cavalryâ The

meat became distasteful after a few days.
Captain P. B. Powell, Xinth Cavalryâ Almost
wholly devoid of the flavor of beef.
Captain Hutchinson, Xinth Cavalryâ lt should
be alternated with other meat. Had heard of
no bad results from its use.
Lieutenant I. M. Manee had found it taste
less and the men would not eat it.
Captain Albert Cummins of the Second Ar
tillery thought some of the meat contained
ptomaines and caused a preat deal of sickness.
As a ration it was a failure.
PLAN TO PREVENT THE
EXTERMINATION OF GAME
SAN RAFAEL. April 7.â lf the Board of
Supervisors should see fit to adopt an
ordinance presented for their approval to
day by Attorney Thomas P. Boyd, and it
is ten to one the board will do that very
thing, one of the merriest rackets kicked
up in rod and gun circles in many moons
will result. In order to prevent the ex
termination of game in Marin County the
Supervisors, acting in accordance with
the petition of local gun clubs and a large
number of prominent citizens of the
county, intend to adopt an ordinance
making it a misdemeanor to kill game and
carry it outside the conlines of the county.
Marin County is the paradise of nim
rods and huntsmen and fisheimen in San
Francisco and Alameda County. For this
reason the county is overrun on Sundays
and holidays with sportsmen, who play
sad havoc with the game. The ranchers
have finally joined the San Rafael Gun
Club, the Novato Gun Club, the Tamal
pais Club and other organizations in a
petition to the Supervisors to adopt an
ordinance giving them relief. Attorney
Boyd was retained to formulate an or
dinance and to-day showed a piece of his
handiwork for the inspection of the board
that drew forth unbounded admiration.
By the terms of the proposed ordinance
it is made a misdemeanor to kill deer,
quail, ducks, doves or other game, or
catch trout or salmon and carry them out
side the county. Any railway or express
company transporting game or fish from
the county is made guilty of a misde
meanor. Deputies are to be provided to
watch at the ferries and see that the law
is enforced.
It is said on good authority that every
lawyer in town has agreed not to de
fend any man charged with violating the
ordinance in case it is adopted. This is
to make the cost of defense as great as
possible. __________^â

Water in Abundance.
WOODLAND, April 7.â Gibson & Clan
ton started their new pumping plant this

would be serviceable hereafter.
Jury Not Yet Obtained.
WILLOWS, April 7.â A jury probably
will have been sworn in the Murdock case

SUICIDE OF A NOTED
MIXER OF DRINKS
THE LATE ARTHUR MILLER.
SACRAMENTO, April 7.â Arthur Miller, a saloon-keeper known through
out California, died by his own hand in this city this morning. For a
week past Miller had been confined to his home with pneumonia, and
terly had become delirious. While thus afflicted he ended his life
with a revolv
Miller had been conducting the famous Rhoads & Townsend House at
Second and J streets for a couple of years. He was a unique character
among saloon-keepers, and he made the business of preparing mixed drinks
a fine art. The Stau- politicians and office-holders who made the Rhoads
& Townsend House their headquarters during the palmy days of that es
tablishment have had occasion many a time to testify to the ability of
Miller in his line. He had been employed In some of the leading: saloons In
the United States, and there were few traveling men of extensive experi
ence who did not know him.
For many years the Rhoads & Townsend House was the political head
quarters of Sacramento. "Frank" Rhoads, the politician, whose influence
is yet potent, held sway there, and no official of the State or county gov
ernment, however exalted his place, considered himself too exclusive to mm
Kle on occasions with the people who patronized the bar over which Miller,
with his corps <~>f assistants, presided.
Those were the day? when the aristocratic mint julep had not been de
posed by the plebeian steam beer and men of the town took their drinks
daintily through straws. "When the steam beer era dawned Miller found that
his business was losing its charm. He established himself in several place 3,
expending: heavy sums on the furnishing of them all, but in each Instance
failure overtook him and he returned to his old stand at the Rhoads &
Townsend House. Miller was a gentleman in his deportment and charitable
to a fault.
HAWAII'S CABINET
VACANCY FILLED
Minister of Foreign Af
fairs Chosen.
By DANIEL LOGAN.
HONOLULU. March 31.â The Cabi
net deadlock ended on Monday with
the appointment of E. A. Mott Smith
as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Pub
lic Instruction. He is a son of the late
J. Mott Smith, who was Hawaiian Min
ister at 'Washington when the mon
archy was overthrown in 1^93. It was
understood at the time that the Min
ister's conduct in showing marked con
sideration for Princess Kaiulani, when
she went to Washington to plead fojr
her country's independence under its
people's choice of government, was not
altogether pleasing to the provisional
government of President Dole. At all
events, Mr. Mott Smith was recalled.
Now the changing times have
brought around, in one month, a state
funeral to the unfortunate Princess and
the elevation of the son of the Minis
ter discredited for paying courtesy to
her when she was alive to a seat in
President Dole's Cabinet.
The new Minister ie only 28 years of
age and has but recently hung out his
Bhingle as a lawyer. For that profes
sion his equipment has been an uncom
pleted term at the Hawaii Law School
and a year's reading In Honolulu law
offices. There is heard some grumbling
aming conservative people at the pre
ferment of a man without experience
in public affairs. Mr. Mutt .Smith has,
however, made a pood reputation as a
man of business in the handling of
large estate trusts. He has taken hold
in the educational departmentâ the one
of his dual offices that has real affairs
left â with the evident purpose of mas
tering details and giving an efficient
administration.
DENNETT'S LOSING VENTURE.
He Dumped a Quarter of a Million in
Searching for Gold.
NEW YORK. April 7.â Deputy Sheriff
Strauss received an attachemnt to-day
against Alfred W. Dennett, the well
known restaurant man. for $1562 in favor
of Sandford S. Swain, who is a stepson of
Dennett, on a claim, it is said, for money
loaned. ,
The Sheriff served the attachment on
the treasurer of Dennett's company to at
tach any interest Dennett may have in
that company. The Sheriff received an
execution against Dennett on February
11 for M 520 for deficiency nn a foreclosure
of a mortgage, but was unable- to reach
any property in this city of Donm-Us,
and execution was returned to-day. A
friend said that Dennett would come out
all right. He had invested $250,000 in gold
mines in California, and all he had got
was a hole In the ground, . like many
others who had invested in gold mines.

SACRAMENTO, April 7.â The people
of this city are looking expectantly for
ward to the conclave of the Grand
Commandery of the Knights Templar,
which will open in Sacramento on the

that the indications were most favora
ble for the success of the gathering. A
letter has been received from the Los
Angeles drill corps announcing that it
will arrive In Sacramento on Wednes
day evening, April 19, escorting Rob
ert M. Powers of San Diego, right emi
nent grand commander of the State of
California. Mr. Hale said it would be
a grand thing if the Golden Gate and
California commanderies of San Fran
cisco could also come to Sacramento
on the evening of the 19th, so as to
swell the parade on the following day,
and Mr. Hale will not give up hope of
accomplishing this happy result.
Forty-two members of the Golden
Gate Commandery have announced
their intention to attend, and from all
quarters come letters indicating that
the Knights and their families will be
present in large numbers. A banquet,
exhibition drill and other features will
mark the conclave.
Already the Chamber of Commerce
has proffered its aid to the local com
mandery in the matter of insuring the
proper decoration of the city with the
colors of the order â black and white â
intermingled with the stars and stripes.
Masonic Hall will be the subject of
elaborate decoration, and a Maltese
cross, formed of many hundreds of in
candescent lights, will blaze forth from
the front of the building.
Some of the most prominent men in
the State, members of the commander
ic-p, will be present, and it is expected
that the banquet, which will be a splen>
did one, will bring forth some clever
addresses. The miles of level bitumen
streets in Sacramento offer an ideal
marching ground, and it is believed
that the parade on Thursday, the 20th
inst., will be an impressive and attrac
tive affair.
STEADY ADVANCE IN
THE PRICE OF MEATS
Average Increase of Two and a Half
Cents a Pound in a Week at
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, April 7.-The advance
In the price of meats has averaged 2%
cents a pound in the past two weeks,
while choice cuts are beyond the reach of
the masses. Southern California, because
of the drought, is not supplying the mar
ket with beet and butchers say it will be
weeks before be*f cattle will be fat
enough to kill. The recent rains pro
duced good pasturage, but cattle must
feed for days before they are ready for
the market. Butchers are depending on
Texas for the beef supply, and buyers for
Los Angeles firms are searching the Texas
plains for bargains. San Francisco butch
ers are getting a great deal of their beef
from Texas. It is said nearly all of the
fat cattle in Arizona have been marketed
The following is the wholesale list now
in effect in Los Angeles and vicinity
Steers, 8% cents a pound; cows, 8 cents

THREW A STEEL
SHARPENER WITH
MURDEROUS AIM
Hot Fight of Butchers
in a Market.
ONE HAS SKULL FRACTURED
THE STEEL PENETRATED FOR
AN INCH AND A HALF.
Frank Austin Arrested for Assault to
Murder, but Claims That He
Actea Only in Self-
Defense.
Two butchers employed at the Bay City
Market on Market street quarreled
shortly after 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, and one threw a long steel sharp
ener at the other, inflicting a compound
fracture of the skull.
Frank Austin and John G. Corcoran
have been employed In the market for
the past nine years. They had been on
friendly terms until yesterday morning.
They were cutting up steaks, when
Corcoran went to Austin's counter and
asked for a steak. Austin asked him
what he wanted a steak so early for, and
picking up one threw it in his face. Cor
coran, it is alleged, called Austin an of
fensive name. This enraged Austin and
"seizing the steel sharpener he threw it
at Corcoran. Austin was about ten feet
away from Corcoran, but his aim was
true. The point of the sharpener struck
Corcoran on the left side of the head at
the top and stuck there. Corcoran fell
to the floor and vainly endeavored to pull
out the sharpener, but had not sufficient
strength to do it. Another butcher came
to his assistance and pulled it out.
A telephone message was sent to the
Southern police station and Policeman T.
E. Burke was sent to the market in the
patrol wagon. He conveyed Corcoran w
the Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Zobel
found that the point of the sharpener
had penetrated about one and a half
inches and had rested on the brain. The
blow had caused a compound fracture of
the skull. After the wound had been
dressed Corcoran refused to remain in
the hospital and walked to his home at
586 Natoma street. He lapsed Into un
consciousness yesterday afternoon and
is In a critical condition.
After Burke had taken Corcoran to the
hospital he returned to the market and
placed Austin under arrest and booked
him at the City Prison on a charge of
assault to commit murder. He then took
Austin to Corcoran's residence and Cor
coran identified him as the man who
threw the steel sharpener at him.
Austin admitted his guiTt, but claimed
that he acted in self-defense. He Bald
that after the throwing of the steak
Corcoran picked up a big butcher-knife
and was preparing to throw it at him
when he Prized the steel sharpener and
threw it at Corcoran. Austin gave Po
liceman Burke the knife which he alleges
Corcoran was threatening to throw at
him. and it and the steel sharpener are
booked as evidence.
Austin -was rek-aped from custody on a
bond for $1000, accepted by Cierk Mc-
Wi-"io of acting Police Judge Barry's
court. At that time it was not known
that Corcoran's Injury was so serious.

Another Unknown Dead.
A^t about 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Officer Greenewald found a man lying in
an unconscious condition on Meiggs wharf.
The ambulance was summoned and he
was taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos

A Growing Trade "With Siberia â An
Old Man Stricken With Death
While Working on the
Steamer Emma.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail
Fteamer Mariposa arrived from Sydney,
N. S. W., via Auckland, X. Z.. Apia,
Samoa, and Honolulu. H. 1., yesterday
morning. She was 23 days 11 hours from
Sydney, and made the run up from Hono
lulu in 6 days 6 hours. She brought up
104 cabin passengers and 74 steerage pas
sengers, besides a large and valuable
cargn. In the strong-room was a million
dollars in Knglish sovereigns, represent
ing the balance of trade in America's
favor.
A hurricane played havoc in Queensland
while the Mariposa was at Sydney.
Houses were blown down and eighty
seven luggers, five schooners and one of
the lightships was wrecked. Eleven white
and 400 colored men lost their lives. The
luggers and schooners were engaged in
pearl fishing, and the colored men were
nearly all "blackbirds" enticed away from
the various islands in the Southern Seas.
A remarkable case of endurance while in
the water is given in connection with this
storm. A dispatch to the New Zealand
Herald says "a colored man reached shore
with two women after swimming four
days."
The Mariposa brings the news of the
escape of five convicts from the French
penal settlement in New Caledonia. The
British steamer Rippingham Grange took
a load of merchandise there, and when
she was getting ready to leave for New
Zealand the convicts stowed themselves
away. They were soon missed and a hue
and cry raised. The Rippingham Grange
was searched, with the result that one of
the escapes was found buried in the coal
in one of the bunkers. The gendarmes
were probing the coal with spears, and
one of the spears went through the con
vict's jaw. He then came forth and gave
himself up. Another convict was found
.stowed away in the lazarette, and he and
his companion were taken ashore. Once
on the wharf they were thrown down,
jumped on, kicked and beaten until one of
the unfortunate wretches was nearly
dead.
Up to this time the crew of the Ripping
ham Grange had assisted the gendarmes
in the search for the escapes, but after
the scene on the wharf they told the sol
diers to do their own searching. Not an
other man was found and the steamer
Balled with the stowaways aboard. News
was sent to the mainland, and when the
Rippingham Grange reached New Zea
land tte police boarded her and began an
other search for the convicts. The cap
tain admitted that the men were aboard,
but said he had ,not the faintest idea
where they were located. The New Zea
land police could find no trace of the pris
oners and the vessel sailed again. Her
next stopping place will be at the River
Platte, where another search will be
made.
At Samoa the British cruiser Tauranga
arrived while the Maiiposa was there,
making three British warships, the cruis
er Philadelphia and the German gunboat
Falke In Apia when the Mariposa sailed.
N. C. Walton Jr., former purser of the
Mariposa, is in Sydney, where he will en
gage in business. His place on the ship
has been taken by C. N. Fulcher. The
latter gentleman is not new to the busi
ness, as he was for years a purser on one
of the O. and O. steamers.
The Canadian Pacific steamers do not
now call at New Zealand, and in conse
quence the people of the islands were de
lighted to hear that the Oceanic Steam
ship Company was building three large
new steamer 3 for the trade.
There is more business than ships on
the water front these days. The steam
tonnage Is not sufficient to accommodate
the increase In trade with the Orient, and
although British tramps have been char
tered, the demand for freight room ex
ceeds the supply. The business with Si
beria has grown with leaps and bounds,
and vessels cannot be secured to carry
all the merchandise destined for Vladi
vostok. Kicolaefski and the Amoor River.
The ships Lucile, Big Bonanza and Wilna
have already sailed for one or the other of
these ports, and the schooners Nokomis,
Vine, Annie M. Campbell and ship Co
lumbia are now loading.
All of these vessels are taking large
quantities of salt and In consequence the
steamers Emma and Mount Eden are
making extra trips outside their regular
Oakland runs bringing salt over from
Mount Eden to fill the various orders.
The Emma was delayed by a sad fatal
ity at Mount Eden yesterday. In order
to make the steamer fast alongside the
landing a couple of stakes had to be
driven. H. Fischer, an old resident of
the place, was at the landing and, after
taking the vessel's lines, picked up a
sledgehammer and began driving the
stakes. In a few minutes he stopped and

Nurses and Doctors Are Now Prescribing
Paines Celery Compound.
Every woman is said to make a good :
nurse.
The opportunity to try is certainly forced
on every woman at some time in her life,
and when the time comes and sickness
enters her home she should know exactly
what to do. She can follow no better ad-
vice than the expert counsel of physicians
and trained nurses who every day see
before their eyes the wonderful results of
Paine's celery compound among their sick,
debilitated and nervously exhausted pa-
tients.
Paine's celery compound is the only
spring medicine that has the confidence
of and is used and prescribed by nurses
and physicians.
For years they have seen patients under
their care rapidly recover health and
vigor from the use of this wonderful re-
storative.
Miss Cora Smith, whose portrait Is
given here, tells of her experience with i
complained of feeling unwell. Engineer
George Rowland and some of the Em
ma's crew helped Fischer to his home,
â¢where everything possible was done for
him, but he* died Inside of half an hour.
Owing to the fatality the Emma lost the
tide and the loading of one of the Sibe
rian fleet was delayed twelve hours.
It Is now several years since George
Rowland, then chief engineer oi the
steamer T. C. Walker; Captain P. A.
Johnson of the steamer Daisy Kimball,
and A. B. Porrell, purser of the steamer
J. D. Peters, joined issues, purchTsod the

"During the past five years I have found ,
that where the system was run down j

results. I am glad to recommend it to !
my friends."
Miss Georgiania Dean, who is a grad-

says:
"In my experience as trained nurse I 'â 
have often observed that where a patient
has been very weak Paine's celery com-
pound has quickly returned him "to his

spring remedy demanded by thoughtful
men and women. It has pushed aside the

however, and soon the steamer was on a

matters considerably. Business grew un

a short time ago the Mount Eden Mas

were put aboard in the best of health,

The American Bhip Marion Chilcott

Willing hands lifted the men and carried
them tenderly up a steep hill to the bunk
house. A messenger leaped nn a horse
and went post haste for medical assist
ance. In the meantime such simple reme
dies as were at hand were applied to al
leviate the suffering of the men. James
H. Stack, manager for Contractor Mc-
Mahon, was some miles away driving
toward the scene of the explosion. He
saw a white cloud drift lazily over the
brow of the hiil which separated him
from the scene of the accident. He called
his companion's attention to it and re
marked that it looked like an explosion.
His fears were verified a few moments
later when he saw the courier depart.
He alighted from his vehicle and or- j
dered it driven to the nearest railway
station, there to await the coming of the |
doctors, who were summoned by wire.
Dr. A. P. Mulligan of Martinez, in the
regular employ of the Valley road, was
the first on the scene. He was followed !
by Dr. <J. W. Stockwell of San Pablo.
They were supplied with lint, oil and i
other articles to relieve the burns. The ;
mÂ»>n were swathed in bandages and made .
as < omfortable as their injuries would j

They were in a prison of stone. The

fierceness with which the powder burned.
The men in the cave were A. Dicker.^on,
Gus Berg and M. McCarthy.
This is the first serious accident in the
building of the Valley road. The hun

labor have escaped scatheless until now.
Manager James Stack was unremitting
in his efforts to procure relief for the suf
ferers. In addition to the doctors he se

which were sent up at once on a launch.
"This Is one of the accidents difficult to

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 8, 1599.
THE POOL MEN'S
FIGHT FOR LIFE
AND DOLLARS
Opening of the Race
track Case.
EX-SECRETARY ON THE STAND
BOOKMAKERS WHO PAY a FOR
TUNE EVERY DAY.
The Plaintiffs Anxious to Show That
the Track L a Very Valu
able Piece of
Property.
The actual trial of the injunction suit
against the police brought by the pool
sellers opened before Judge Murasky yes-
terday. There was hut one witness exam
ined. W. B. I. cake, who two years ago
was secretary of the Pacific Coast Jocko-
Club. He was called to tell of the im
provements which had been added to the
bare land bought by the racing associa
tion, and how much of it would become
valueless if racing were discontinued at
the Ingleside track. He also told of the
fortunes the bookmakers pay to be al
lowed to ply their trade in the betting
ring.
Henry Ach, attorney for the plaintiffs,
the poolmen and the jockey club, made an
opening statement in which he declared
the plaintiffs would prove that the pool
selling ordinance was never violated; that
the business of the plaintiffs has been se
riously injured by the' presence of the po
lice, and that should the attempt of the
defense to stop the plaintiffs' business be
successful it will result in irreparable in
jury to the plaintiffs. The contention of
the defense is that it is not the presence
of the police at the track that has caused
the plaintiffs trouble, but their persistence
in maintaining a business In violation of
the law.
Mr. Leake was secretary of the jockey
: club from March, 1895. to March, 1897.
During that time the track was built up
from a barren waste to its present condi
i tion, and the witness was questioned
! closely as to the value of all these lm-
I provements.
He was asked the value of the grand
standâwhat it cost to build, how many it
i would accommodate and what its present
' value is. Ach's questions then turned to
the paddock, the stables, the clubhouse,
the kitchens and outbuildings, and all
the permanent improvements. Then he
1 took up the land itself, and found from
' the witness that the whole thing, land,
improvements and all. is worth about half
a million. Then Ach showed the object of
his questions by asking what would be the
value of all these if racing were discon
i tinued at Ingleside.
The question was objected to, but the
court passed it. and the witness answered
fty saying they would be worth a great
deal more for racetrack purposes than
for anything else. He could not judge of
would "all be valueless.
1 Then Ach took up the privileges. He
', inquired about the bar privilege, the
i restaurant, the kitchen, the feed store,
; the harness shop, the programme privi
: letre, the candy, the poolboys and tho
j bookmakers, the telegraph, the field
' glasses, the over-night entries and the
handlcappers. He was told the value of
each at the time the witness was secre
tary of the association and was informed,
too", that if racing were discontinued they
would all be worthless.
On, cross-examination, despite the ob-
J jections of opposing counsel, the defense
had the witness tell all he knew of pool
selling and betting at the track, both by
the ladies in the grand stand through the
poolboys and by the men in the betting
ring. He told how the bookmakers paid
$lini a day for the privilege of making
books, and whenever there were more
than five races in the' day they paid pro
portionately more. The witness said there
were from twelve to thirty bookmakers
always doing business in the betting ring,
besides two field hooks which paid $150
a day each. There was an average of six
! races a day for the season.
Regarding profits, Mr. Leake said that
in the time he was connected with the
i jockey club the track cleared over $175,000,
: but that most of this was put back into
the track in permanent improvements.
1 Since 1897, he understood, there had been
i paid a stock dividend of 100 per cent and
a dividend on the actual amount of stock
! issued of 6 per cent. The only actual cash
dividend, therefore, has been this 6 per
! cent, amounting to about $30,000.
Witness was also asked about the car
1 lines plaintiffs' counsel seemed to think
! had been inveigled out to Ingleside, and
Mr. Leake stated that perhaps they
! would not be so valuable for a while if
: racing were discontinued. It had been
| shown that the gate receipts amounted
I to anything from $1000 a day to $5000 and
i over, figures which represent a good many
: more people.
The trial was not interesting, for it in
| eluded milch that the defense is willing
ito admit. It is not denied that the busi
-1 ness has been a large one, but it is not the
j racing they are attacking; it is the pool
! selling, Â«and no one can deny the fact that
| hundreds of thousands of dollars have
i come and gone through that same nefari
i ous business of the poolseller.
Physical Culture
Professor Walter Magee of the Univer

POLITICAL PLUM
FOR DR. LAWLOR
OF SAN QUENTIN
Prison Physician to
Be Health Officer.
SO NOTIFIES WARDEN HALE
MANY ANXIOUS CANDIDATES IN
MOURNING.
The Meaning of Lawlor's Recent
Mysterious Visit to Sacramento
and His Elation on Re
turning Explained.
There is one luscious political plum, for I
the possession of which a good deal of I
wire-pulling has been carried on, that j
has finally been apportioned across the |
bay, and several candidates who thought j
themselves in a fair way to secure the
prize will have to nurse their disappoint- j
ment as best they may and try again.
Dr. Lawlor of San Quentin, the official j
"prison physician," is to be the next j
Health Officer of the city and county of j
San Francisco. Governor Gage himself j
has said itâ so far no one has been dis
covered that can swing a sledge hammer I
hard enough to turn the mind of Gage on
the proposition.
For the past week or ten days rumors '
have been floating around in political cir
cles that Lawlor was to secure this cov
eted position, but until yesterday nothing
definite or authoritative could be learned. I
Simultaneously comes the news from a !
close friend of Gage and from Lawlor |
himself that he is to have the position.
A few days ago the physician notified j
Warden Hale that it made no difference j
to him whether or not Aguirre was to be
Warden, because he (Law lon intended to j
resign and become the. Health Officer of f
San Francisco. He further asserted that j
Gage had given him a definite promise I
he should have that plum.
During the last session of the Legisla- j
ture Lawlor found it convenient to go to !
Sacrajnento several times and leave the I
patients in his care to the tender merciea I
of the prison druggist. It was known j
then that he was after some important
position, but he kept a close mouth, and â 
until lately nobody knew what he wanted i
or what his chances were. Now both are
knownâ to the sorrow of several place- i
hunters.

"THEY ARE WORKS
OF ART" SAYS
MR. BACIGALUPI
His Indecent Pictures
in Court.
JUDGMENT OF AN EXPERT
PROPRIETOR OF THE ART SA
LOON ON MORALITY.
Eleven Vulgrr and Suggestive Pho
tographs Tell Their Own Dam
aging Story of In;ent to
Corrupt.
Peter Bacigalupi and his immoral pic
tures were up before Judge Barry yester
day. Bacigalupi was under arrest for
violating the ordinance forbidding the ex
hibition of indecent photographs, and the
evidence against him consisted chiefly
of some' samples of his wares.
In the basement of the City Hall the
police had put one of the captured slot
machines in working order and had filled
it with pictures taken from Bacigalupi's
place of business. They were not all
taken from one machine, but represented
the principal attractions of several. The
pictures were vulgar and suggestive;
there was nothing artistic in any of them
and from their character it was plain that
art was not the object of their existence
or exhibition. A painted woman in more
or less suggestive pose, with clothes
enough to bring her within the law, but
bo 'imposed as to put her without the law
again, was the subject of each. They
were cheap and tawdry and not worth a
nickel from either standpoint, decent or
indecent, but there was no mistaking
their corrupt intent.
Policeman Tyrrell was the first witness
for the prosecution. He told how, on
April 1, ht and hi? brother officers had
raided the Bacigalupi place and had con
fiscated certain of the pictures he had
found there exposed to view. He de
scribed how the pictures were in slot ma
chines and for the convenience of those
who were not tajl enough to properly
peer through the eye-piece there was pro
vided for each machine a little box for
the boy or girl to stand on. It was evi
dent that the machines were for the edi
fication of young as well as old.
Tyrrell was asked what he had done
with these pictures and he said he had
them- downstairs, whereupon the court
adjourned â  to the basement and court,
clerk, bailiff and counsel for both sides
inspected the evidence. Returning to the
courtroom Tyrrell identitied the pictures
he had taken from the machine in evl
â  . and the pictures themselves were
made part of the case against Bacigalupi.
The ordinance claimed to have been vio
lated was then introduced and after the
defense had admitted the other officers
woulfl testify as Tyrrell had done the case
for the prosecution closed.
The defense opened with a motion to
dismiss, hut the motion was denied and
Bacigalupi was called. Great stress was
laid by his counsel on the fact
that Bacigalupi pays a license to
protect his business. Counsel ar
gued that the defendant conducted a le
gitimate business, under proper license
and "in the open day." He declared the
pictures were photographs of actual per
sons in actual poses that may be seen at
any time in any part of the country. Pros
ecuting Attorney Carpenter argued that
while the law allowed and his license pro
tected the defendant in the sale and ex
hibition of decent pictures, he could not
plead that as an excuse for indecency.
Bacigalupi testified that he had pur
chased the pictures in Paris and they
had been brought into the country
through the Custom-house; no customs i
officer had found fault with them, he paid,
and he had no trouble in getting them in.
He said these in court he had had on 'ex
hibition for three years, and he did not
consider them at all out of the way. Car
penter asked him if the place was open
to anybodj .
"Anybody, man, woman or child can see
them if they drop a nickel."' was the an
swer.
"Minor or adult?" asked the court.
"Anybody," again was the reply.
As an expert on morality, Thomas G.
Dunn, who keeps the Art saloon, was
called. He said he had been buying works
of art for years, and he thought himself
qualified to pass upon the morality of the
photographs in evidence. Carpenter ob
jected on the ground that while he might
be a critic on art. it certainly had not
been shown he was an expert 'on moral
ity, but he was allowed to say he thought
the pictures were not indecent or Im
moral.
On cross-examination he was asked if
he had "works of art" in his own place,
and he said he had.
"Pictures of naked women?" queried
Carpenter.
"Yes."
"Would you exhibit them to your chil
dren?" was the next question.
"Ye?." said Dunn, "to my children, or
my wife, or my grandchildren."
That was enough for the prosecution,
and Mr. Dunn, expert on pictorial mor
ality, was allowed to depart.
That ended the proceedings for the day.
The case had progressed farther than the
defense expected, and they were not
ready to go on immediately, so the trial
went over until Thursday next.
LABOR VS. EXPANSION.
Opposed to the Importation of Fili*
pino Musicians to This City.
At a meeting of the San Francisco La
bor Council last night that body placed
itself squarely on record as being against
the policy of the United States Govern
ment in acquiring the Philippine Islands.
The matter that drew forth the expres
sion of the council was the proposal of
the Mechanics' Institute to employ forty
musicians from the Philippine Islands.
At a previous meeting the secretary was
instructed to write ' Jetter to the board
of directors protestiii b against this act.
That letter was received and referred to
the committee on music of the institute.
This way of getting around the question
did not suit the members of the Labor
Council, and as a result the following
resolution was passed at the meeting last
night:
Whereas, We learn that there is under
consideration by certain parties in San
Francisco a plan to employ labor from the
Philippine Islands; and
Whereas. The reasoning used in the fur
therance of this project is that the pres
ence in this locality of certain classes of
Filipino laborers would tend to create a
sentiment among the public in favor of the
control by the United States of the Philip
pine Islands, with the consequent result of
adding the labor and product of these isl
ands to the United States upon a basis of
equality in law with the labor and produc
tion of the United States; therefore, be It
Resolved, By the San Francisco Labor
Council at a regular meeting assembled,
that we are opposed to the employment of
Filipino labor, or products on the terms
named, either directly or indirectly, as be
ing an aggravation of the alien labor evil,
and broadly a violation of the labor and
other laws made and provided in such mat
ters; and be it further
Resolved. That we protest against the
present policy of the national Government
which gives the color of equity to the im
portation of cheap Asiatic labor; a policy
which, in our* opinion, is disguised express
ly for that purpose in order that the safe
guards of the American people may be de
stroyed by the invidious influence of con
tractors with a low standard of low civ
ilization; and be it further
Resolved. That in our opinion the solution
Of the question of imported Filipino labor
depends on the future attitude of our Gov
ernment to the people of the Philippine Isl
andsâwhether these people will be allowed
to enjoy the liberty as a nation which they
fought for and won and which are our in
alienable rights as men, or whether they
shall be subjected and compelled to serve
an exploiting class under the government of
the United States; and be it further
Resolved. That we favor the granting of
full and complete independence to the Fili
pinos and the protection of these and all
other peoples in the enjoyment of their na
tural conditions.
A resolution was passed instructing the
secretary to communicate with the Park
Commissioners regarding the eight hour
law on all public works.
Much joy was manifested at the report
that Carpenters' Union No. 22 had by a
unanimous vote decided to affiliate with
the Labor Council.
PRICE AND SQUAD
TO BE REMOVED
WRITTEN REQUEST PRESENTED
TO CHIEF LEES.
Lieutenant Price and his squad of four
men, as suggested by Chief Lees Thurs
rioy. sent in a written request to the Chief
asking that they be removed from China
town. The request is signed by William
Price, Stephen Bunner, Paul J. Butler,
William King and Charles H. Taylor. It
is as follows:
The undersigned, the present Chinatown
squad, hereby respectfully request to be
relieved from further duty in Chinatown.
We all feel that we have done our full
duty in this detail to the best of our abil
ity and we respectfully refer you. In this
behalf, to the records of the courts and the
Treasurer' office. We are, however, very
greatly and disagreeably and unnecessar
ily hampered in the effective 'discharge of
our duty by the unfounded and untruth
ful reports concerning ourselves which have
lately appeared, and to so great an ex
tent has this developed that we are pre
cluded from attempting the performance of
our duty without the presence of witnesses.
Under these circumstances you will readily
roni attempting the performance of
without the presence of witnesses.
toko circumstances you will rendlly
understand how we are impeded and ham
pered, nd for the sake of the department,
as well as for our own sakes, we request
to be relieved from this detail.
The Chief intimated that he would con
sider the request and act upon it In due
course of time. It is probable that a new
squad will be detailed for Chinatown in a
day or two, but considerable difficulty will
be experienced in Retting a suitable man
to take charge of the squad.
The Chief submitted a statement yes
terday which shows that Sergeant Pe'r
rin's squad from March 4 to September 14.
1897, made 1640 arrests and the fines paid
amounted to $5445: Sergeant Shea's squad,
from September 17 to April 29. 1898. 1735
arrests, tines .paid $13,300; Sergeant Mc-
Manus' squad, from April 30 to February

truant Price's squad, from February
16 to March 31. 335 arrests, fine's paid $2701.
Total arrests from March 4, 1597. to
March 31, 1899, 5741; total fines paid. $37,776.

GAME CHARGE
MADE AGAINST
THE EXECUTOR
Heazelton's Account
Excepted To.
REAY HAS A GRIEVANCE
THE MANAGEMENT OF MABEL
TREADWELL'S ESTATE.
It It Being Conducted, It Is Alleged,
With the Purpose in View of
Defeating Claims of
Debtors.
A. W. Reay, who holds a judgment
against the estate of the late Mabel
Treadwell for the sum of $4800, has come
into court and filed .a bill of exceptions
to the second account of George Heazel
ton, executor of the last will of the de
ceased, in which he openly charges .the
executor with attempting to bankrupt the
estate in order to defeat his claim. The
matter of the settlement of the account
was called by Judge Coffey yesterday, but
upon the filing of the exceptions by
Reay's counsel, J. B. Mhoon, the case
went over.
The account of the executor is a large
one, the items excepted to covering many
thousand dollars. Reay cxcepts first to an
Item in the account of $200 for office rent,
on the ground that the office was not
needed by the executor in which to per
form labors on behalf of Mrs. Treadwell's
estate, and was used for other purposes.
On the same ground objection is made to
telephone and other bills. Then two
claims, included in the account of W. S.
Goodfellow for the aggregate sum of
$2150, are asked to be disallowed on the
ground that they are unlawful. Lloyd &
Wood's claim for $2000 is also contested on
the contention that it is unauthorized, as
are those of Eugene Deuprey for $500, a
legacy to H. C. Summers of $5000. a claim
of George A. Knight for $300. and a pay
ment made to H. C. Summers of $2000,
which It is contended was illegal. An
account of $2200 for real estate is also in
cluded in the exceptions, it being claimed
that the real estate in question does not
belong to the estate, and lastly an item
of $13,148 45, being money in the vaults of
the California Savings and Loan Society,
is asked stricken out as it was adjudged
to be a portion of the estate of C. F.
Summers in an action recently determined
in Judge Troutt's court.
These are the main accounts to which
the judgment debtor- takes exception, but
in his closing paragraph he cites his most
interesting conclusion. In his opinion, he
avers, the executor is managing deced
ent's estate so the same will be insolvent
and ultimately no property left with
which to respond to hi? claim. What an
swer Heazelton will make to this charge
is at present a matter of speculation.

THE NEW PRIMARY LAW.
1"* HE first experience of the politicians with the
itton primary law has not resulted in entire
disappointment. An election took place at
Stockton early this week at which delegates were
elected to municipal conventions of the principal po
litical parties. There was no contest in the Demo
cratic organization, and consequently the Democrats
>ted the Republicans in choosing
their delegates. How many Democrats voted with
the different Republican factions cannot be ascer
tained, but an evening paper is authority for the state
ment that a belief is prevalent in the vicinity of the
slough city that the Republican convention was
selected by Democrats.
Senator Stratton says he is very much pleased with
the operation of the new statute, and in a communica-
tion to a morning contemporary he congratulates
himself that things are no worse. He admits that it
is difficult to keep Democrats from voting for Repub
lican delegates, and vice versa, but he thinks in time
this evil will subside â on the ground, we presume,
ter the new statute becomes thoroughly under
stood both parties will have all they can do to take
care of their own business.
In connection with the Stratton primary law it
should be noted that the Non-Partisan party of this
city has relinquished all idea of testing its validity
before the Supreme Court. This would seem to in
dicate that the Non-Partisans do not regard it as
inimical to their interests. On the other hand, they
have appointed a committee of lawyers to examine
the Rickard ballot law and pronounce upon its con
stitutionality. It is said that these attorneys will re
port against the statute and that the Non-Partisans
will immediately inaugurate a contest designed to
obliterate it from the statute-books.
On the whole, we gather from Senator Stratton's
communication, from the action of the Non-Partisans
2nd from the success of the new primary law at Stock
ton that the cohorts of reform are well satisfied with
the situation. Mr. Stratton declares that one grati
fying effect of his- law has been the introduction of a
large number of voters to primary politics who have
heretofore remained at home. This we concede is
a gratifying result, if it shall be followed up by a
repetition of the experience of Stockton in other
places, but the grand te-t of this primary legislation
will take place in San Francisco. Here the science
of boss politics has been worked down to a fine
point, and if the people succeed in electing nominat
ing conventions representing thei^own wishes in this
city, Senator Stratton may indeed "congratulate him
self upon his work.
SOMEWHAT ERRONEOUS.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the New York
:cr stating "an incredible story
comes from California to the effect that a
phiiantl aned Spreckels proposes to invest
$10,000,000 in the establishment of an electric plant
that will furnish to the people of San Francisco light,
heat and power at a fair margin of profit above the
cost," goes nn to say:
"If Mr. Sprcekels does anything of the kind he
will assail rhe fundamental principle on which our
existing magnificent system of public franchises is
established. Mr. Spreckels could not more directly
antagonize the vested rights of franchise-grabbing if
he should propose to pay taxes on his franchise prop
trty."
Our New York contemporary is slightly in error.
It is not thoroughly posted on California affairs.
Mr. Spreckels is not posing as a philanthropist, but
is a business man who works for the advancement of
the State and the welfare of the people by business
methods. Moreover, in this case he is not interfering
With franchises, h does not require a franchise to
start a lighting company in San Francisco. The law
provides a free way for competition, and that is where
the metropolis of the Pacific is better off than the big
y the Atlantic.
The controversy between Huntington and Herrin
over the Senatorial fight is not so one-sided as it ap
pears on the surface. It is true Huntington is doing
all the talking, but Herrin's unwonted silence speaks
louder than words.
The park extension proposition will give us a good
subject to talk about during the spring fever days,
and will prove a pleasant pastime, provided we keep
cool.
Whether the cost of lighting in this city is voted
up or voted down, the people have one consolation â
competition is coming.
THE RAINFALL IN CALIFORNIA.
I 7E directed the attention of our contemporaries
\ Â« / in Oregon and Washington a short time ago
*" to the fact that their expressions of sorrow
over the drought in California were uncalled for, and
that their frequent assertions of the failure of our
orchard and farm crops were unjustified. Since then
they have perceived the truth of our words and now
the reputation of California is no longer suffering
from ov,erdone protestations of sympathy from that
source.
A new set of sympathetic friends has arisen for us,
however, in the Southern States, and the people along
the Gulf coast are condoling with us and consoling
themselves with the statement that the drought in
! California is worse than the blizzards that swept over
| them during the past winter, killing the orange
groves all through the South and spoiling the Mardi
Gras celebration at New Orleans.
In an editorial published March 26 the New Or
leans Times-Democrat, after asserting that lamenta
tions are going up in this State from stock-raisers,
Ei-growers and orchardists, and that the drought
been especially oppressive and destructive be
! the previous" year was also dry, says:
he experience of the last two seasons gives rise
to the belief that California is becoming an arid
State, like Western Nebraska and Kansas. When
the tide of emigration carried thousands of people
into those States they found a fertile soil and a cli
mate that while dry had a sufficient rainfall to allow
the cultivation of crops. But it grew more arid from
year to year, drought succeeded drought and crop
after crop failed, until the situation became unendur
able. It looks as if California were going through
Bi the same experience."
: give the date of this editorial for the purpose
irecting attention to the fact that it was pub
d thirteen days after the bountiful rains of
March had put an end to the drought and assured
good crops throughout the State. It thus appears
that while any temporary evil in California is widely
commented upon, the brighter side of our conditions
and prospects is unnoted.
The circulation of these stories of drought and dis
aster are of some importance since they are likely to
affect the judgments of home-seekers and of capital
ists who are looking for investments. The discredit
they cast upon the State affects us in many ways, and
as it is not at all likely that our Eastern contem
poraries desire to injure California, we have a right
to expect them to correct the injurious reports when
the falseness of them is pointed out.
The Central Pacific Railroad Company has recently
published an elaborate chart showing the monthly
rainfall of San Francisco for fifty years. It shows
that during that long period the fluctuations in rain
fall have been remarkably slight. In the whole
course of the fifty years there have been but two
seasons of drought, and these were forty-eight years
apart, the first being in 1850-51 and the second in
The regularity of the rainfall for long periods of
time is shown by the fact that if the forty-eight years
from 1849-50 to 1896-97 are divided into four periods
of twelve years each we get the following results:
From 1849 to 1861 there fell 269.31 inches of rain;
from 1861 to 187.3 the fall was 301.88; from 1873 to
1885 there was a fall of 282.31; from 1885 to 1897 the
fall amounted to 287.14 inches. The last group, it will
be noted, has 18 inches more rain than the first group.
This chart prepared for San Francisco effectually
disposes of the Eastern theory that California is
about to become an arid State, so far at least as the
region north of Tefrachapi is concerned. An equally
good showing can be made of course for the average
rainfall in the south, and we suggest to our contem
poraries in that section that they urge the preparation
of such a chart by a Board of Trade or some other
organization able to undertake the publication on a
comprehensive scale.
It is time to put an end to these stones about Cali
fornia, and the best way to do so is to publish the
facts and submit them to our Eastern contemporaries
who have been misled into circulating the injurious
reports.
SOCIAL AMERICANISM.
ONE of the published descriptions of a recent
marriage in New York pales the gorgeous
memories of Mrs. Grundy. For American
readers it puts the event as most notable "because it
brought a union of two great fortunes; because
thousands of dollars were lavished upon its prepara
tion and fulfillment; because it gives the child of a
once humble California miner marriage connection
with the house of Marlborough of old England; be
cause the guests who offered their congratulations
possessed countless millions of wealth."
American imperialists, who coarsely imitate im
perial realities, may enjoy this unspeakably vulgar
picture which by genuine Americans will be resented
as an insult conceived in ignorance and brought
forth in stupidity. Our restricted commercial rela
tions with foreign princes, some of them genuine and
some of them not even brevetted, have not so far re
sulted in their exclusion from our soil by a prohibi
tory tariff and, fortunately, or unfortunately, under
our constitution, are beyond the control of a duty on
exports. They have not yet been regarded, however,
as furnishing a typical occupation for American so
ciety. Our best families are still proud to trace their
origin to early colonists or to revolutionary heroes or
to their prototypes abroad, and have evinced no
anxiety to connect themselves, by blood or by matri
mony, with the hungry and covetous aristocrats
whose ancestors endowed them with stolen and van
ishing fortunes.
It is probable also that we have retained sufficient
republican severity not to gauge our respect for mar
riage by the Pactolian streams it unites, by the lavish
expenditures it sometimes excuses or palliates, or by
the golden tinge of the congratulations. The dis
contented millionaires, who are disgusted with
monotonous equality and who disguise their nation
ality in the suburbs of imperialism, are still few and
far between. They were probably absent from the
matrimonial festivities that some reporter desecrated
in our quotation. But, though far from numerous,
they are nevertheless a developing class, and by their
blatant conspicuousness and pretensions they cheapen
their country before the world. They are akin to the
expansionists, who would prefer to reign in Asia
rather than to hold their equal rank among American
sovereigns on this continent.
The infelicities of toadyism and pretentiousness are
hard to endure, because they veil or distort the sur
face of American civilization. There is a rhythmic
harmony and a pure beauty in the unique social con
ceptions that our institutions and our condi
tions naturally produce which should enlist the
pride and stimulate the honor of every man
and of every woman whose patriotism is true
and strong. Here factitious rank, the gewgaws
of artificial distinction, are constitutionally for
bidden. But here also inherent rights and equality
before the law do not compel promiscuous associa
tion. Society, with the family as its unit, divides and
THE SAN FBAS CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 8, 1899.
classifies itself, and in the exercise of free choice, in
fluenced by individual taste and by the suggestions of
circumstance, without clash or jar, men and women
blend into assimilated groups. This is society, not
made by law nor regulated by artificial assump
tions, but fashioned in natural molds, protected by
educated intelligence.
In the United States, with its eighty millions,
there are social circles that preserve American origin
ality and concurrently fit into modern cosmopolitan
ism. These are the noiseless representatives of
our enduring civilization â the homes of unaffected
refinement, where sacred thoughts and sacred feelings
dwell in a congenial air, where artistic simplicity is
secluded from the complex vulgarities, where knowl
edge is peacefully absorbed and digested, where truth,
virtue and modesty combine their exquisite propor
tions, where chastity and tenderness are shielded
from coarse publicity and unconscious of ostentatious
rivalry and of sensational ambition. This is the so
ciety of which Washington Irving wrote, and which
is far from extinct, though amid the roar and whirl of
this clashing and noisy peroration of the century
rarely observed. The interviewers and reporters are
useful concomitants of the times, but there is a deep
still pervading life within our social fabric that re
sembles the silent forces of creation and of preserva
tion, and that yet nourishes our hereditary and ad
vancing Americanism.
IT is well to watch the development of the Cuban
issue. We hold the island now under military
government, which goes on with the usual friction
which forever attends upon the exercise of arbitrary
power.
The problem of the future from the Cuban side
impinges entirely upon General Maximo Gomez. He
is a San Domingan negro, a man of military spirit
and training, of high intelligence and the genius of
leadership. He succeeded to command upon the
death of Maceo, who was also a negro, and for the
last eighteen months his name has been more promi
nently before the world than that of any other Cuban
leader. That he is an adroit politician as well as a
brave and skillful commander is just now demon
strated. His feint of a return to his wife and his
plantation in San Domingo, followed by the dissolu
tion of the Cuban military assembly, and his apparent
recall to authority by the popular voice, are events
which he has controlled in spite of domestic opposi
tion among Cubans, and undoubtedly in the face of
opposition and discouragement offered by the mili
tary authorities and financial influences of the United
States.
He stands for Cuban independence in good faith to
the people of the island, and professes a belief in the
good faith of the United States. Therefore he treats
our military occupation as temporary and continues
his agitation for independence and self-government.
If we stand in good faith upon the pledge made in
our declaration of war against Spain the policy of
Gomez is also our policy.
But there are indications that influences in this
country are at work which have no regard for our
plighted faith and none for the freedom and self
government of the Cubans. Hence the statement,
published yesterday, that the political programme of
Gomez "means the keeping Up of agitation and dis
turbance in the minds of the people and the weaken
ing of American authority by producing the impres
sion that everything done by the Americans is tem
porary and may sooner or later be overturned."
Pray what other impression is possible as to our
presence in the island, if we abide by our solemn
declaration? The programme of Gomez should be
regarded as complimentary to the United States, in
asmuch as it is the simple statement that we told the
truth and will keep faith.
But, it is added to the above: "American observers
consider any such agitation as extremely harmful to
industrial revival and the restoration of Cuban credit.
Some who are high in authority and who have ex
ceptional opportunities of knowing the character and
ideas of Gomez thirik the United States will have
trouble with him yet. His attitude has always been
consistent regarding Cuban independence and he is
still working for the same end." If any American
will explain why we should not be working with him
to that end, instead of threatening him with trouble
if he persist, the country will be glad to know why.
The "American observers" who think the consistent
programme of Gomez is harmful to the industrial re
vival of the island certainly do not stand for the honor
of their own Government. They say to the Cubans:
"We came here on the declaration of our Congress
that you were and ought to be free and independent,
and that we would withdraw on your organization of
a stable government. But all agitation for the for
mation of such a government weakens our authority
here. We want industrial revival of your country for
our benefit, so please, Messrs. Cubans, go at work for
us on the plantations and raise for us sugar and to
bacco, very cheaply, and don't have anything to do
with politics." That is what it amounts to, and it
remains to be seen whether Cuban independence lost
all of its friends in this country when it ran counter
tc American desire for commercial profit.
A year ago the Cuban flag and the Stars and Stripes
were together in every window, and we all learned to
say "Cuba libre." Is it possible that all this was
merely to get Cuba to exchange King Log for King
Stork?
It was only a little .while ago that the Nicaraguans
were reported to be eager for the annexation of their
country to the United States, and now it appears we
have to send the Detroit to their seaports to make
them behave themselves. Such an extraordinary
revolution of sentiment in so short a time is a record
breaker even for Central America.
Murderer Moore, late of Nevada City, has suc
ceeded so far in eluding the manhunters, but all hope
has not been abandoned. The facile correspondents
have begun hurling adjectives at him. They are
shelling the brush in Nevada County with sesquipe
dalian qualifiers, any one of which is calculated to
bring down the game.
What can Mayor Phelan do to rehabilitate him
self with the Maguire men? He promised to be at
the Poodle Dog banquet, but, instead, was a pas
senger on the "owl" for San Diego. He will hardly
learn enough wisdom from that bird to fit the round
peg of explanation into the square hole of fact made
by his absence.
The proposed exchange of the Philippines for the
British West Indies is good for us, but it is doubtful
if the British will agree to swap a set of well do
mesticated tax-paying colonists for a set of Filipinos
they would have to hunt in the brush.
There is a scientific belief that the earth is flatten
ing at the poles. Ex-Governor Altgeld is willing to
swear that it was noticed" by him last Tuesday in
Chicago.
It is doubtless the opinion of Mr. Herrin that Mr.
Huntington talks too muclv

IRRIGATION
AND FORESTRY
COMMISSIONERS
Appointed in Spite of
the Vetoes. "
SIX "THANK YOU" OFFICIALS
WATER AND FOREST SOCIETY
GOES AHEAD.
Will Voluntarily Follow Laws Ve
toed by the Governor an- Makes
Prof. David6on Commis
sioner of Irrigation.
California has a Commissioner of Irri
gation and a Forestry Commission even
if Governor Gage did pocket the bills
passed by the last Legislature creating
these important offices.
The laws thus enacted and killed were
passed at the initiation and recommenda
tion of the California Water and Forest
Society, lately organized to deal with the
vast problem of the State's water re
sources and their conservation. Now the
Water and Forest Society has gone ahead
in the direction of carrying out the laws
practically as if they had been approved
and has appointed the officers contem
plated.
The Commissioner of Irrigation is Pro
! fessor George Davidson and the Forestry
Commission is composed of Professor E.
W. Hilgard of the University of Califor
nia, Professor Dudley of Stanford Uni
versity, Abbott Kinney of Los Angeles,
Warren Olney Sr. of San Francisco and
George Towle of Placer County.
The officers named are simply officers of
a voluntary society, but it is the idea
that they shall in a large measure fulfill
the functions of such State officers. This j
action was taken at a meeting of the
executive committee in the office of S< c
retary E. H. Benjamin day before yes
terday. The president,- United States Sur
veyor General J. M. Gl eaves; Secretary
Benjamin, E. A. Denicke, John P. Irish,
Elliott McAllister. Frank Soule, Julian
Sonntag, Craigie Sharp, Edward F. Adams ,
and others were present. It was the con- |
sensus of opinion that the society should
go ahead with the work contemplated in i
the beginning and strengthen itself with
members and money.
In effect the defeated legislation pro
vided for the appointment of the officials
named, to serve without pay; that the
Commissioner of Irrigation should co
operate witn the United States Geologi
cal Survey in preparing surveys, esti
mates, etc., for sites for storage reser
voirs for impounding waters for mining,
agricultural and industrial uses; that re
ports be made on the feasibility, etc., of
such reservoirs and irrigating systems,
and that the Forestry Commission should
devise means of protecting the forests of j
the State from destruction by rire or wan- I
ton depredations, and recommend moans
for preserving the forests and of storing i
and distributing the flood waters of the
State
Such Commisisoners could do little more
in two years than acquire information in
a field "that requires a vast amount of j
investigation and formulate recommenda
tions for further progress. This the Cali
fornia Water and Forest Society proposes
to do. Professor Davidson will give to
the work what time he can spare from
his work as professor of commerce at the
university, and others will devote much
study to the problems.
"The society recognizes the fact that
the question of the control of the waters
of the State Is the great one." said Pro- j
fessor Davidson yesterday. "How fur is
the State and how far is the Government ;
in control and to what extent does the
common law doctrine of riparian rights
interfere with the best disposition of the
waters of the streams and lakes? I sup
pose that I will be expected to co-operate
in finding what can be done toward con
trolling at leaet the flood waters. Infor
mation will be compiled. Investigations
made and the possibilities canvassed. The
first thing the society needs is money. One
thing will be early discovered. If we have
a good year it will bo hard to stir up in
terest- in irrigation and allied subjects.
Last year people were suddenly interest
ed in the water resources of the State
and the importance of the water prob
lem. In 1*73 the people wr-nt wild for ir
rigation. The next year there was plenty
of rain and irrigation was forgotten. That
has always been the- way with them."
It is expected that a great deal of in
formation will be compiled in a report
which will be laid before the next Legis
lature, with well considered proposals for
legislation. _______________

MINERS WANT MORE ROOM.
Prospects of the Paris Exposition
Worry the Association.
At a recent meeting of the executive |
committee of the California Miners' As- j
sociation the members found themselves |
quite at sea concerning a California min
ing exhibit at the Paris Exposition.
It is understood that $25,000 of the $130,000 !
appropriated for a California exhibit
shall be devoted to mining, but the min
.ers find that sum is too small and the
space to be allowed for the exhibit prom- |
ises to be lamentably inadequate.
During the meeting J. F. Halloran, pro
prietor of t*he Mining and Scientific Press,
urged that something ' decisive be done
and that the best possible advertisement
of California's mineral resources be made.
Mr. Halloran said that only 8000 square
feet was allowed for the entire mineral
exhibit of the I'nited States and that on
that basis California's space for its min
ing display would be about 8x35 feet.
Many thought that unless an adequate
display could be made it would be better
not. .to make any at all.
As definite information was not at hand
and as the Governor has not named the i
Commissioners, no definite action was i
taken. Much interest was displayed in I
the coming meeting here next fall "of the j
Institute of American Mining Engineers, j
ami President Neff was directed to apÂ»- j
point an executive committee to take j
charge of arrangements and a reception '
committee. The committees will be j
named soon.

HOWLS MAY BE
EXPECTED FROM
STOCKTONIANS
Favor to Be Shown
Port Costa.
CHANGES IN GRAIN RATES
WILL TEND TO SIDETRACK THE
SLOUGH CITY.
i . < â¢ â¢
Proposition Is Now Under Consider
ation by tne Members of thÂ«
State Railroad Com
mission.
When the Railroad Commission com
pletes the reduced grain rate schedule on
which it is now at work, it will show
rates to Port Costa from points in the
San Joaquin Valley that will cause a
howl to go up from the people of Stock
ton. These figures will show a difference
of 30 cents in favor of Stockton, instead
of 50, as is now the case. The result of
such a reduction in favor of Port Costa
will greatly tend to send wheat for stor
age and shipment to that port instead
of to Stockton.
It is known that the proposed reduc
tion to Port Costa is inspired by the men
interested in the warehouses at Port
Costa, their sole object being to secure
more business by thus depriving Stock
ton of considerable of what now goe3
there.
It is expected that before the new
schedule is ready for submission, the liti
gation between the Southern Pacific Com
pany and the Railroad Commission will
have been compromised, and the '*'*?'
cleared for any reductions that the South
ern Pacific may consent to.
This matter of a differential rate be
tween Stockton and Port Costa has been
the subject of contention for some years,
and the Southern Pacific has always here
tofore claimed that no change could be
made In it without direct loss to the com
pany. When inquiry was made at the or
flces of the frieght department of the
railroad as to what action would likely
be taken in regard to the proposed re
duction of the rate to Port Costa, it wa9
stated that no good reason was known
for making such a reduction. The opin
ion was further expressed that the move
ment was evidently due to the efforts of
the Port Costa people, who hoped to
profit by its success. It was claimed that
the difference in the rates to Port Costa
and Stockton respectively should really
be greater than 5o cents a ton, but that
the rate to Port Costa had to be kept
to that differential, because the cost of
transportation by water from Stockton to
Port Costa was only 50 cents a ton.
Another reduction that will be asked
for will be in the rate on grain from
Livermore to San Francisco. This is now
$1 80 a ton. A reduction to $1 50 will ba
asked.
GERMS THAT ESCAPE.
Surveyor ".pear Will Hold the Fed
eral Quarantine Officer Respon
sible for Negligence.
For some time past Customs Inspectors
have been complaining to Customs Sur
veyor Spear that incoming steamers have
been allowed by the Federal Quarantine
Officer to pass outside the boundaries of
the quarantine district before the Quar
antine Officer has fulrilled his duty and
given a clean bill of health. Owing to the
apparent neglect of duty on the part of
the medical arm of the Federal service
the Customs Inspectors complain that
they are obstructed in the discharge of
their duties.
In order to effect a reform of the abuse
Surveyor Spear yesterday addressed a
letter to the Quarantine Officer to <.ne
effect that when a vessel passes the quar
antine district, which is west of a line
drawn from the end of Powell street
wharf to the middle of Alcatraz Island,
the Customs Inspectors will assume that
the vessel has been inspected and given
free pratique and will forthwith board
her and perform their duty in spite of
smallpox, yellow fever or other germs.

The reason why these predictions can
be made earlier this year than ordinarily
is largely owing to the warning given the
farmers by The Call that the Board or
Slate Prison Directors had found it neces
sary to call a special meeting and rescind
a former order permitting bags to be sold
in any quantity, and even to cancel sev
eral large orders, in order to circumvent
a suspected scheme on the part of specu
latois to corner the output of bags pro
ducfd at the San Quentin jute mill and
thereby "cinch" the rural fraternity out
of most of the profits of an excellent year.
Within ten days after the facts in this
connection were published 1,500,000 bags
were sold in lots varying from 200 to 50uu.
In one day orders came in for over 170,000.
Every bag on hand, over 3,500,000, has now
been disposed of and orders are being

The vast majority of these orders have
come from the San Joaquln Valley, from
Kern, Tuli Kings. Fresno and Merced
countiesâ the dry belt, where before the

best estimated when the fact is borne in
mind that in no case have more than 50 0
bags be-on sold at any one time, and from
the smaller farmers orders have been in
the hundreds.

GAS BILLS ARE LAID
OVER FOR A WEEK
FINANCE COMMITTEE FAILS TO
PASS UPON THEM.
Collins and Attridge Decline to Ac
cept the New Bate at Adopted
by the Board.
The action or rather lack of action of
the Finance Committee of the Supervi
sors on the municipal gas bills yesterday
could not have been the cause of the new
slump in the price of gas stock. But not
withstanding the price broke from %IZ\.
the closing price on Thursday, the high
est price for yesterday being $73.
Finance Committee met during the
aftfrnoon. Chairman Perrault and Messrs.
Collins and Attridge being present. The
chairman asked what was to be done with
the bills for lighting the streets and pub
lic buildings for December, January and
February, and the question arose as to
whether the new order reducing the price
of gas to $1 10 had gone into effect yet.
An effort was made to get Clerk Russell
to express an opinion on the matter, but
that gentleman declined to commit him
self. He said the board had finally passed
the order and it remained for the Finance
< 'otiimittee to decide whether it should
audit the bills. "
The bills were then produced by Collins,
who said he would not audit them, as he
â¢ led the reduction from the old to the
rate as unreasonable and unfair. The
bills for the three months for electric
lights in public buildings as originally
presented amounted to $4345 30, but they
had been reduced to $32^8 96. The gas
bills for the same purposes originally
footed up $9098 40, but when the expert
applied the new rate they showed
M 672 16. The bills for street lighting by
electricity wore reduced from $10,1*9 50 to
$8243 13, while the gas bills for the same
â¢ were reduced from $15.301 6G to
ill "21 22 The total amount was $39,
--724 86 while the reductions give a total
of 129,295 47, a saving to the city for three
months of $10,329 39.
Perrault took the bills, saying it was not
a question of fairness, but whether the
committee was to accept the new rate.
Ilf thought the proper way would be to
audit the bills, and if the company was
not satisfied it could bring suit for the
difference.
The chairman then signed the bills and
handed them to Attridge. who fingered
them gingerly for a moment and then
laid th(-m aside without attaching his
name to th^m.
After some further discussion Collins
suggested that the bills be laid over for a
week, and as Attridge thought that was
the best course to pursue It was so or
dered-

A JURY SAYS
"NELL SHEEHAN"
WAS INSANE
Mystery of Her Suicide
Cleared Up.
WAS "BILLY" ISAACS' WIFE
CORONER HILL HOLDS A WEAK
KNEED INQUEST.
i
The Woman Was Married, Abused
and Deserted Within a Month
and a Half and Her
Reason Failed.
A Coroner's jury yesterday came to
the conclusion that little Nellie Sheehan,
who took carbolic acid Thursday night,
committed suicide while "temporarily in
sane. The deduction was based upon the
evidence of her brother, J. D. Sheehan,
and W. C. Isaacs, known familiarly as
"Billy" Isaacs, who in the course of his
testimony admitted he had married the
girl in Oakland on February 28. When
asked upon what he based his assump
tion that his wife was insane, he coolly
answered that it was because after he
had accomplifpied her ruin she had in
sisted daily that he should make amends
so far as he might by marrying her, and
that he had finally done so. When he
first met Nellie Sheehan he was living
with a woman whom he had introduced
to all hjs acquaintances as his Wife,
Borne three months ago she brought a
baby to him and since that time he has
cast her out to get a living as she might.
He neglected her for the Sheehan woman,
and remained with his new love until her
repeated requests that he marry her .an
gered him. A threat of exposure and sui
cide and numerous other like potent sug
gestions finally brought him to time.
It is said that he ill-treated her from
that time. The evidence her brother gave
yesterday proved that even in her Dest
moments she was melancholy and the
cruel desertion of Isaacs worked upon her
until she was brought up to the point
where self-destruction seemed the only
relief from- thf life she was leading.
i.-aacs did not dwell upon his treatment
of the woman in the tpstimonv he gave
yesterday. He simply vouchsafed a Dare
outline of the girl's story and with that
Coroner Hill seemed Hatisrted. In fact,
the Coronor'P investigation of the case
was not marked by thoroughness. For
snnif reason nicely concealed somewhere
about Mr. Hill's well-rounded person the
inquest was secret. The newspaper peo
ple were barred out, but the reason for it
was plainly evident in the fact that
Isaacs and the girl'S brother were the
only witnesses, besides Dr. Shields, who
were examined. Shields denied that he
knew anything of the girl or her sjtory
and he was plied with no further ques
tions.
The jury rendered a verdict of "suicide
by carbolic acid while temporarily in
sane."
SAMOAN REVOLT.
General R. H. Conliffe, Who Wit
nessed the Fight, Is Here.
General R. H. Cobliffe of the British
army, who was retired in ISM, after see-
Ing service in Madras for fourteen years,
arrived on the si earner Mariposa from
Apia yesterday and registered at the
Grand.
Genfral Onnliff> was present at the
hombarrlm^nt of the suburbs of Apia in
the effort made to dislodge Mataafa's fol
lowers.
"I was simply an onlooker," said Gen
eral Conliffe, "and took no part in the
putting down of the outbreak. When I
left Samoa, Mataafa's men appeared to
be quieted, but the British and American
soldiers were on the alert for the least
sign of another uprising, which is re
garded as highly probable. I believe the
war vessels Philadclp...a. Royalist. Por
poise and Taurango will be able to cope
with the difficulty, for they are com
manded by splendid officers and manned
by fine marines.
"There is no doubt that the proclama
tion issued by the German Consul caused
the natives to revolt, and I cannot, un
derstand why h* took up the cause of
Mataafa sin^e thp Berlin treaty expressly
excludes Mataafa from assuming kingly
honors. Admiral Kautz carried out the

r T'HE pleasant method and beneficial effects of the well-known remedy, Syrup of Figs, manufactured
â *â¢ by the California Fig Syrup Company, illustrate the value of obtaining the liquid laxative principles
of plants known to be medicinally laxative and presenting them in the form most refreshing to the taste,
and acceptable to the system. It is the one perfect strengthening laxative,
CLEANSING THE SYSTEM EFFECTUALLY, DISPELLING
COLDS AND HEADACHES, PREVENTING FEVERS,
OVERCOMING HABITUAL CONSTIPATION PERMANENTLY.
Its perfect freedom from every objectionable quality and substance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, gently yet promptly, without weakening or irritating them, make it the ideal laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs are used, as they are pleasant to the taste, but
THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES ARE OBTAINED FROM SENNA AND OTHER AROMATIC PLANTS,
by a method known to the California Fig Syrup Company only. In order to get its beneficial effects, and
to avoid imitations, please remember the full name of the Company printed on the front of every package.
Consumers of the choicest products of modern commerce purchase at about the same price that others
pay for cheap and worthless imitations. To come into universal demand and to be everywhere considered
\he best of its class, an article must be capable of satisfying the wants and tastes of the best informed
purchasers. The California Fig Syrup Company having met with the highest success in the manufacture
and sale of its excellent liquid laxative remedy, Syrup of Figs, it has become important to all to have a
knowledge of the Company and its product. The California Fig Syrup Company was organized more than
fifteen years ago, for the special purpose of manufacturing and selling a laxative remedy which would be
more pleasant to the taste and more beneficial in effect than- any other known. The great value of the
remedy, as a medicinal agent and of the Company's efforts, is attested by the sale of millions of bottles
annually, and by the high approval of most eminent physicians. As the true and genuine remedy named
Syrup of Figs is manufactured by the California Fig Syrup Company only, the knowledge of that fact
will assist in avoiding the worthless imitations "manufactured by other parties.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April â To-day's sensational
etoek market was remarkable for great declines j
that took place in practically all the special
ties. Losses of importance remained at the end
of the day, although the closing was strong. ;
The potential influence behind to-day's plunge !
In trices â¢ .is the money market, where dis- j
crimination was exercised against the Indus- i
trial securities. The inability of some large j
firms to renew loans on these shares as collat- ]
eral ma it necessary ..... stocks at the j
best prices obtainable. Call rates for money
ranged from 5 to 15 per cent, but left off at the j
lower figure. The forced sales by many com- I
mission houses lent renewed courage to the
Vars, who constantly found new spots of weak- j
iess. A number of money lenders on the floor !
>' the Exchange refuEed to pay any attention i
lo the bid* made by some brokers who were
known to be trading heavily in the industrials.
The calling in of some loans also helped to |
arouse alarm and induced general selling.
The weakness of many standard stocks and >
X>nds was due to no other cause ascertainable j
.â¢xcept the selling of them by weak holders to
protect securities of less certain value or secure
fund? to buy the shares which had been most '
depressed in hope of profit on the rebound.
London, which of late has been an unimportant
factor in the dealings, bought upward of 50,
--000 shares on the decline here. While the so- i
called bull leaders appeared apathetic on the
downward rush of quotations, heavy scale buy- j
Ing appeared, carrying with it the conviction ]
that the buyers did not believe the violence of |
the bear movement could last. The support i
gradually checked the fierce untaught on
prices and recoveries ensued. Much thought j
wo? given to the probable aspect of to-mor- i
row's bank statement. The rally was found In i
the offering of several million dollars in the!
loan crowd â¢ v an interest lately very prominent j
among the bull leaders. When prices were not !
far from the lowest a number of commission
houses freely advised purchases where the I
buyer could take the securities outright or on |
very substantial margins. Buying of this
character had much to do with checking the
rush to sell. Many interests which had been j
out of the street for a long time thought the
time opportune to repurchase, as It appeared
to be one of the bargain days which developed
at various times of recent years.
This buying gave a considerable momentum
to the afternoon rally, which embraced every- ;
thing on the list and assisted in reducing, the j
net losses to very small proportion in some t
cases and in establishing Blight advances in
others. An idea of the wide movements which
occurred is given by the fact that although
Brooklyn Transit broke V,' . the net loss on ,
the day was only o\. Metropolitan lost ]Â£ and
gained 12 1 *. Manhattan yielded 9, but regained i
â¬ 4- Sugar sagged 13%, but only showed 24
net lpss at the close. Airbrake dropped 15, '
but rallied l3Vi>- American Tobacco eased off I
19 points, but figured for only 3 points net on I
the day. National Steel dropped 13^4, but got
back 9% of it. People's Gas sagged 12*4, but '
rallied strongly and closed with 3% net loss.
Railway and miscellaneous bonds also showed j
a yielding tendency to-day, with transactions j
of $3,CM,000.
United States new fours advanced %, and the
r.'.d fours upon hi in the bid price, while the
fives reacted "'â *.

BRADSTREETS REVIEW OF THE NEW
YORK STOCK MARKET."
NEW YORK. April 7.â Bradstreefs Review
of the New York stock market to-morrow will
say:
The hardening of the money market prior
to April 1 failed to arrest the bull movement
in stocks, but this week the continuance of
high ratps for call loans, together with an in
! discrimination by the banks and other
lenders against industrial storks have been
followed by liquidation and general declines in
prices. The impression of the street in regard
to money has h>*en that more plentiful sup
plies and easier rates w..uld be se^n this week.
Thit was somewhat unreasonable, a? whatever
funds are taken to thÂ» interior for the Apri
settlements are slow to drift bark t" the finan
cial centers. On the other hand, the closing
large industrial deals results in tying, up
large sums temporarily, the money market be
ing thus influenced during the last few days
by the operations of the syndicate in charge
of the American Smelting Company, while at
the beginning of nest week I- 1,000 is to be
paid into a trust company by the subscribers
to the Alton syndicate. Such operations re
strict supplies and result in shitting of loans
and time money is significantly easy at 4 per
cent. The call loan rate In Wall street all week
ha;; bf-n 6 per cent. Rome q I 18 liW
! as 5 per < ent were made, bjlt on the other
. hand, the rate for balances at the stock ex
â -â¢ has touched 12 per cent, it is still
the general imprest-ion th.it easier money for
speculative purposes will return, but the mar
ket is considerably exercised alÂ»'Ui the new in
dustrial storks and the attitu.ie of money
lenders to them. In spite or the conservative
feeling about such securities, the spi'.-ulati^n
in them f.;i> been increasing, large amounts
being held on margin Fr^rn the beginning
of the movement, banks have shown a
nance to the new Industrials as i illateral,
even when they constituted only a small pio
portlon of th' securities. The tlghtr.< .-? ol
money this week seemed to cause Increased
rejections of Industrials in mixed loans and
rendered it more dirfirult for brokerage houses
to carry such securities. This led to cr.si i
pral le liquidation in the industrials, tl â 
dines In that quarter unsettling the rest of the
list, and on Friday the apprehensive feeling
of the street seemed to culminate in an out
! pour of long stocks and serious d^lines
'â  throughout the list. Railroad shares, however.
j regained a better tone and more liberal sup
plies of money coming into the market, thfre
â¢ was a general rally In the afternoon.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW Y^RK, April 7.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say:
The quieter tone of distributive trade Is even
more marked this week than last, testifying
to the unfavorable effect upon retail trade and
indirectly upon jobbing distribution of thf cold,
backward spring and less favorable wheat crop
aftvices. While reports as to the damage to
winter wheat are most numerous from the
Southwest, the influf-n.-es of the backward sea
eon, frost In th n ground and other unfavor
able conditions havp tended to moderate the
hiterto very cheerful tone of advices from
the spring wheat States.
Other features of the week are a further
quieting down of the excitement in iron and
steel, though here lack of supplies and not
lack of consumptive demand Is assl^m-'i as the
chief reason. A strike of iron ore miners in
the Lake Superior district seems like
ly to complicate the ore supply ques
tion. Strikes involving 15.000 men have been
a feature of the week's operations. Lumber Is
feeling the Influence of expanding spring de
mand at many markets and prices axe very
strong.
The situation in textiles is little changed.
Cotton Is slightly lower on fuller crop move
ment, but manufactured goods are firm,
though some speculative lots of gray cottons
have been offered at concessions. Wool and
â¢woolens are rather quiet, though fall orders
for women's wear goods are encouraging and
the raw product is steady, the view being that
the proposed goods combinations have not got
very large supplies of wool. The situation as
regards prices Is still a very favorable one,
the list of staples advancing or remaining
steady being by far the most numerous, while
bank clearing statistics, railroad earnings and
all other obtainable measures of trade prog
ress point to an immense business, speculative
and otherwise, having been done during the
fir.-^t quarter of the year lssa. Throughout "the
West and Northwest, with few exceptions,
complaint Is made of unseasonable cold weath
er affecting distribution, particularly at retail.
Accompanying these reports, however, are
numerous statements that the business done
during the first quarter is considerably in ad
vance of that handled a year ago. Complaints
of bad weather and roads come from the
South, Texas trade and agricultural conditions
being unfavorably affected and New Orleans
reports that spring trade Is likely to be dis
appointing for a like reason.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3.384. bushels, against 3.
--858.23S bushels last week, 3.778.72*! bushels In
the corresponding week of 189S: Z. 036,797 bushels
in 1897, 1.764.805 bushels in 1896, and 2.934,179
bushels in IMS.
Kince July 1. this season, the exports of
wheat aggregate 155.345.600 bushels, against
â  278 bushels last year.
Business failures for the week number 190,
exactly the same number as last week, but
compared with 220 In this week a year ago
232 In ISS7; 231 In 1886, and 225 in 1895.
Business failures for the week in the Domin
ion of Canada are light, numbering only 21
&n against 33 last week, 39 In this week a
year ago, 32 in 1597. 30 In 1896 and 26 In 1895.
DUNS REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, April 7.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
f Failures in the first quarter of 1899 were In
I number 2772, against 3687 last year, and the
! liabilities $27,152,031. against $32*94â¬,i65. a de
crease of 17.66 per cent. Geographical aspects
make the returns peculiar, with a slight In
crease of defaults In New England, a decrease
of 13 per cent in the Southeast and' 2o per cent
'in the Central States. There was a decrease
i of nearly 40 per cent in the Pacific and South
western States, 41 r>er cent in th.- v.
I States and 4.86 per cent in the Middle States.
I No other year of the twenty-four covered hy
Dun's quarterly reports has shown as small
failures during its first quarter, excepting 1880
and 18S1. and no other except 1580 and
small liabilities per failure. The average of
defaulted liabilities per firm in business, only
$22 19. is smaller than In the first quarter of
any year except 1880, and the rate of defaulted
liabilities to solvent payments through clear
ing houses, only $1 12 per $1000, is also the low
est for the quarter, except in ISs>).
Tbe famine In iron, caused by urgent demand
far exceeding the present supply, not only con
tinues, but has caused haste to start 4S addi
tional furnaces with an output estimated at
39,970 tons weekly, of which the bulletin of the
Iron Association has given a list. These are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATUKDAY, APRIL 8, I8Â«y.
expected to increase production this month
and yet more in May and June, and some
weakness has been attributed to the prospect.
But the price of gray forger has again ad
vanced to $14 50 at Pittsburg, without change
in other quotations.
The demand for products is still enormous.
Contracts for the East River bridge covering
tons of acid open hearth steel have been
placed at Pittsburg, and one covering 6000 tons
for a Newark building, besides one at Phila
delphia for 3000 tons of ship plates, with many
j for bridge and other works, and in pipes new
business is so great that it forces prices farth
er in, while parties are trying to consolidate.
The Republic Iron and Steel Company will
be the combination of Western bar mills and
the hoop and cotton tie association will soon
be completed.
In another industry' progress seems to have
been caused by firmness of manufacturers, who
notified customers that options for boots and
shoes not accepted for April would be with
drawn. A great number of orders followed, it
is said, and April begins with the largest ship
ments for that week In any year, 98,734 cases,
making the total for the year larger than in
any year excepting 189 S.
Manufacturers who bought leather at low
prices six months ago have comfortable mar
pins, but those who buy at the higher prices
lately quoted are seeking an advance, which,
as befora. Jobbers generally refused.
The market for copper' is stronger at 18c for
lake, and while domestic consumption is heavy
the Increase of 4100 tons in the European supply
in March is not considered encouraging.
The woolen manufacturer does not yet seem
to have gained by recent consolidations or pro
posals, but goods of the finer grades are steady
in prices, with moderate orders, while medium
and low grade goods tend In buyers' favor.
The demand for a few kinds has covered the
season, but makers of the large majority are
yet In need of orders. Sales of wool have but
slightly increased, though more inquiry is re
ported, with a better demand for some grades
of goods. The cotton mills have enjoyed a fine
demand of late and have held prices well, but
strikes have now closed several larse mills
about Providence and Norwich, growing out of
the recent advance in wages, which the hands
claim does not affect the full restoration prom
ised. Meanwhile cotton has been weaker, with
better receipts in March and poorer foreign
demand.
Wheat has been fluctuating; without much
visible reason, rumors being wildly contra
dictory, as usual at this season, and command
ing not much more confidence than usual. The
exports from Atlantic ports for the week, flour
included, have been 2,074,763 bushels, against
2.240,172 last year, and In spite of all reports
the current receipts continue to exceed last
year's. The prospect for the continuance of
large exports of staples has not improved
within the past ten days. t
Failures for the week have been 141 In the
United States, against 232 last year, and 18
In Canada, against 32 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 7.â Wheat opened with
a show of firmness which it soon lost. The
slight improvement was in consequence of
. sales at Liverpool and country offerings
jof winter wheat. The break in the New York
I stock market and liberal shipments of wheat
from Argentina to Europe had more argu
ments with traders, however, and liquidation
started a downward tendency. May start
ed %i??iie higher at 72?4@72%c. and in the
course of a couple of hours' trading declined
to 71^0. A slack foreign demand and milder
weather also accelerated the selling. Trading
] was active when prices were declining and an
immense quantity changed hands at around
72c for May. The Monon Miller, which up to
to-day had claimed promise of an average
yield in its weekly summary, said the week
had seen general deterioration of the winter
wheat. When this announcement was made,
prices began to rise. About an hour from the
close the loss had been recovered, May reach
ing 72% c. It did not hold, however, but grad
ually dropped back to 7l\c, at which price
it closed.
Corn held fairly steady, but weakened at the
cloEe in sympathy with the decline in wheat.
Business was largely In the way of changing.
May corn closed at 4'5%c lower.
Favorable weather and the weakness of the
other grains caused the downfall in oats. There
was some profit-taking by longs. The cash de
mand was tame. May oats closed V*@%c
lower.
Provisions ruled firm but sluggish with out
side speculative interests conspicuously small.
May pork closed 24(gt>c higher; lard and ribs,
unchanged.

HAY AND FEELtTUFFS.
Receipts of Hay were large again and the
market was weak with a decline in several
descriptions.
Dealers report that Oat Hay shows lees weak
ness than the other descriptions, for it is stead
ily increasing In favor as feed. Many who
formerly used wheat exclusively are changing
to oat, hence it is thought that the difference
in price between the two descriptions will be
less than formerly.
Bran and Middlings stand the same. Rolled
Barley is declining.

THii bTOUK MARKHiT.
There was a fair amount of business on the
morning session of the Bond Exchange. Ha
waiian Commercial advanced' to $87. Contra
Costa Water sold at $65 50<Â§65 75 and Gas and
Electric at $74 50Q74 75. Other changes were
slight.
On the afternoon call Hawaiian Commercial
advanced .to $83 25 and Gas and Electric de
clined to $73 75, seller 30.
The tendency in mining stocks was down
ward, with rather more selling. The pump is
not lowering the water at present, but merely
holding it in check, pending drainage of ground
and changes in the machinery, and this acts,
as a damper on the public. The telegram from
the pump said: "Elevator shut down for six
and a half hours last night. Water rose thirty
one feet. Elevator started and water lowered
again twenty-seven feet in nine hours. Water
in 1750-foot level winze is thirteen feet seven
inches below the station."
On the bond session of the San Francisco
Stock Exchange 25 shares of Hawaiian Com
mercial sold at $87 and 10 shares of San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric at $74 75.
The usual exploratory work was done in the
Standard Consolidated mine of Bodle for the
week ending April 1, according to the official
report just received. The ore in several of the
prospect openings on the 150, 318, 336, 470 and
525-foot levels is not of good quality, although
the showing is better at other points. Connec
tion has been made between the 3SO and 470-foot
levels. The stop.-s are yielding the usual quan
tity of ore on the 150, 270. 318, 336. 470 and 532
levels in the Moyle, No. 10 and Fortuna veins.
Some very good ore is being taken from the
Fortuna. During the week the mill crushed
.'4" tons of ore. Average assay vanner tailings,
$12 45. Concentrates produced, Hi tons: assay
value, $1111 13. Amalgam produced, 1021 troy
ounces; value per ounce, $2 56.

AMONG THE BATSMEN.
Country Cricket Clubs Join the Cali
fornia Association.
Lake County cricketers are looking for- I
ward to a good season this year. At its
annual meeting hold last month the Burns
| Valley Cricket Club elected the following |
| officers: W. S. Bayton, president; R. ;
i White, vice president; G. E. Webber, cap- i
| tain; T. W. Beakbane, secretary and treas- ;
] urer; H. P. H. Haggitt and E. E. Gray, :
j members of committee. In addition to
the above named, the following will play:
R. Beale. W. Turner, J. P. Davis, G. I
Jones, James Purves, R. Anderson and J. |
Palmer. R. B. Brown will officiate as
scorer and G. Turner and G. Wood as urn- '
plres. The Burns Valley cricketers have 'â 
' a new ground at Lower Lake landing. It
i has lately been leveled and rolled, and the .
i wicket will be one of the best and truest '

Association, but has not yet elected Its
delegates.
The Lakeport Cricket Club held Its an
nual meeting at the Hotel Giselman,
j Lakeport, on March 29. with Charles Mif-
I flin Hammond, president. In the chair.
] There was a large attendance of members.
The following officers were elected for
the ensuing year: Charles Mifflln Ham
mond, president; Judge R. W. Crump,
Captain W. B. Collier, A. W. Johnson,
John P. Moore. Joseph Craig and Godwin
Scudamore, vice presidents; Herbert V.
Keeling, captain and secretary; F. A.
Greene, treasurer. It was decided that
the Lakeport Cricket Club should join tho
California Cricket Association, and W.
O. Edmands and Allen H. Spurr were
elected delegates thereto. The reports of
tho secretary and of the treasurer
fhowed that the club was in a thoroughly
sound and flourishing condition. Vice
President A. W. Johnson, who is now in
England, has offered a bat as a prize for
the best batting average obtained during
the season. The Lakeport men are do
: slrous that a team of San Francisco crick
j eters should visit Lake County this year
and hope themselves to visit this city in
the year 1900. No team from Lake County
has visited San Francisco since 1895. All
last season's players will be on hand this
year except H. E. Hudson, who has gone
to Fresno. H. S. Rose, the fast bowler,
who did such good service In 1898, will
j play this year, and the team bids fair to
be fully as strong as last year's eleven,
i which was never beaten. All the eleven
j are American citizens and most of them
j learned the game in Lake County. Tho
i first match will be played against Burns
Valley about May 1.
The Santa Cruz County Club intends to
play cricket, but has not yet secured a
suitable ground. The San Jose club has
been much weakened by the death or
removal of several members, so that it
may not be able to make up an eleven this
yenr. The annual meeting was to have
been held last month, but no news of it
has yet been received.
The Mountain Copper Company Cricket
I Club of Keswick, Shasta County, recently
i held a general meeting, at which it waa
! unanimously decided to join the California
1 Cricket Association, R. N. Truman and
! T. W. G. Wallace being elected delegates
j to that body.
President Edward Brown of the Call-
I fornia Cricket Association left Philadel-
I phia on April 1 for Great Britain, via
] Italy, Switzerland, etc. While absent the
: president will see several of the gTeat
matches, such as All England versus Aus
tralia, Gentlemen versus Players, Surrey
versus Yorkshire, etc.
At the annual meeting of the Pacific
Cricket Club A. W. Wilding, Thomas

I Donald were elected members.
TROUT FISHING IS
IMPROVING DAILY
ANGLERS WHO HAD GOOD SPORr
RECENTLY.
Warm Weather Will Bring Forth In
sect Life, and the Stream
Whippers Will Feel
Happy.
The anglers who took advantage of the
first day of the trout fishing season and
tramped through coast streams in quest
of small Bteelheads, did not meet with
very good success, as the creeks wero
too high and the fish were gorged with
food.
The past week of warm weather will
vastly improve the sport, and fly-fishing
should be good on the Lagunitas and Pa
per-mill in Marin County and the So
noma, Pieta and Big Sulphur creoks in
Sonoma County. The Los Gatos and its
tributaries should also prove worthy of
a good whipping after another week of
sunshine.
Austin Creek, which empties Into Rus
sian River near Duncans Mills, has been
famous up to recent years for the excel
lent sport It afforded visiting anglers.
For the past two or three seasons Aus
tin has fooled many lovers of trout fish
ing, and the Fish Commissioners con
cluded to investigate the cause of the
scarcity of trout in that beautiful stretch
of rippling water. As already stated in
The Call, -Messrs. Babcock and Wilson of
the commission made a tour of Inspec
tion last Sunday and captured three na
tives in the act of dynamiting the pools.
This fact explains the reason for the
scarcity of trout in tha stream, and it i.s
hoped the transgressors of the law will
he punished severely for the offense. The
trial of the fish destroyers will take
place to-day at Santa Rosa.
John Butler, Lloyd Eaton, Frank Mar
cus and Professor Terry returned last
Monday from San Gregoire Creek. They
reported that the watur was too high,
and that fishing will not be good for a
few weeks.
One hundred and fifty anglers, includ
ing the regulars and volunteers, fished
the I .agunitas and Paper-mill creeks last
Sunday with varying success. The run
of ii.sh takc-n wa.s small, but there are
several nice-sized trout in the streams
which will put in an appearance in the
baskets of the experts when the creeks
will have, run clear and low.
Fred Johnson caught a nice mess of
fish in Suscol Creek, near Monterey.
Frenchmen who are stationed at Toca
loma have been persistently fishing Pa
per-mill Creek since the Ist' inst.
"Billy" Kittle caught a beautiful mess
of trout in the Country Club lakes last
Sunday. Among the varieties taken were
Loch Leven, cutthroat and rainbow. Two
of the Loch Levents weighed one pound
each.
A member of the Country Club, or at
least a man who has the privilege of
shooting and fishing on the club's pre
serve, caught 125 so-called Irout in Okina
and Bear valley creeks last Sunday, and
the average size of the fingerlings was
three inches.
The following communication is self
explanatory:
Sporting Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
Fishing on Paper-mill and Lagunltas creeks on
the opening day and Sunday was fairly good
considering the large number of anglers who
patronized them. Â»
The streams were somewhat high for fly fish
ing, but the majority dispensed salmon roe,
shrimps and worms with lavish hand.
The largest fish caught on the opening day
was a six-pound steelhead, and Billy Chambers
must be credited with the best basket. He had
forty-six trout, all over eight Inches, and quite
a number twelve and fourteen Inches. R. E.
A. laenbruck also hud a fine lot of fish. Kewell,
Kennedy and "Wax End" Mead were not very
successful on the Lagunltas. Their complaint
was that about fifteen antlers got an early
start and kept In front of them trie entire trip
down from LibertvÃ, taking the center of the
stream.
A. B. Finch and Fred B. Surrhyne expect to
whip Lagunltas next Sunday. As this will be
Surrhyne Initial trip it will be well for Finch
to keejo out of harm's way ami either send
Surrhyne on ahead or lose him.
The fishing should be good next Sunday. A
royal coachman, March brown and a gray
hackle peacock body will be good (lies to use.

AMONG THE OARSMEN.
Formation of a Western Rowing As
sociation Being Discussed.
The absorbing topic of discussion
among the oarsmen Is the approaching
convention of delegates from the various
rowing clubs. A circular has been sent
to the clubs around San Francisco, and
to those at Stockton, San Diego, Ta
coma, Seattle, Portland, Victoria, Van
couver and other places, requesting each
to send three representatives to a meet
ing to be held in Justice of the Peace
Barry's courtroom Tuesday evening,
April IS. The purposes of the meeting are
to discuss the future of rowing on the
Pacific Coast, and the means to be em
ployed to carry out a successful rowing
season in 1889; the advisability of form
ing a new organization controlling row
ing only, or of joining the Nationa-. Asso
ciation of Amateur Oarsmen, and the
advantages of withdrawing from the Pa
cific Association of the Amateur Ath
letic Union.
The Alameda Boat Club and the South
End Rowing Club are the chief support
ers of the movement and will certainly
propose that the rowing men withdraw
from the Pacific Association. The former
club has for two years belonged to the
National Association of Amateur Oars
men. The Pioneers and Ariels are strong
ly in favor of standing by the P. A A
ahd the former will send no delegates to
the convention. The Ariels, after con
siderable discussion, have decided to send
Howe. McGinnis and Nolan as their rep
resentatives. The Dolphins are divided
In their opinions, the older members be
ing disposed to support the P. A. A., and
some of the younger members favoring
tho formation of a rowing association
Some of the Tritons favor the new idea
while the attitude of the Olympics is
doubtful. The advocates of tho new idea
quote a letter of James E. Sullivan, sec
retary of tho Amateur Athletio Union,
in which he says: "The A. A. U. does
not control amateur rowing. We have
nothing to do with regattas; that is left
to the National Association of Amateur
Oarsmen." At the next monthly meeting
of the board of managers of the P. A. A.
there will come up for adoption an
amendment to the constitution to tne
effect that the P. A. A. assumes juris
diction over rowing, baseball, indoor
ba.seball, boxing and other sports. Those
who are opposed to this amendment say
that for a subordinate body, such as the
P. A. A. is, to attempt to enlarge its
jurisdiction and to assume control over
matters in which the higher body from
which its own existence is derived ex
ercises none is logically absurd, and re
minds one of a man trying to hoist him
self up by his own bootstraps.
The managers of the P. A. A. say the
oarsmen here need some higher local
body to which to refer disputes, without
the necessity of sending to an authority
far away in the Eastern States, unfamil
iar with local conditions. They assert,
moreover, that the oarsmen have pros
pered under the P. A. A., and that the
experiment of forming a rowing associa
tion has been tried before and has failed.
The oarsmen complain that money con
tributed by them is expended upon track
and field days for athletes, to which the
managers of the P. A. A. reply th^*
money is made at field days which goes
to provide prizes for rowing regattas.
W. Dupli3sca was slightly wounded in
the shoulder and T. Lynch severely in
the arm during the recent fighting near
Manila. Both are South. End oarsmen
and members of Battery G, Third United
States Artillery.
CITY GOLFERS WILL
PLAY AT OAKLAND
THE SECOND HOME AND HOME
MATCH TO-DAY.
Names and Rank of the Eight Cham
pions of the Oakland and San
Francisco Clubs.
Last Saturday was a busy day both on
the Oakland and the Presidio links, many
players being out practicing for the sec
ond home and home match between teams
representing the San Francisco and Oak
land Golf clubs, which begins this after
noon. At the Presidio S. L. Abbott Jr.,
H. Babcock, J. w. Byrne and H. D. Pills
bury entered the April competition for
the Liverpool silver medal, but made no
returns: E. J. McCutchen, Worthington
Ames, Leonard Chenery and several
others were also at the links. The course
had dried out from the thorough soaking
it recently received, and the heavy roller
was being put over the green, which will
be in good condition for the visit of the
Oakland players on Saturday, April 15.
On the Oakland links last Saturday the
fifth tournament oi the season for the la
dies' cup was held, the contestants being
Miss L. Moffltt, Miss A. Moffltt, Mrs. W.
P. Johnson. Miss Deane, Miss Belle
Mhoon and Miss Agnes Duff. In the first
round Miss Belle Mhoon defeated Miss L.
Momtt 2 up; Miss Deane beat Mrs. John
son 4 up, and Miss a. Moffltt won 8 up
from Miss Duff. In the second round
Miss A. Moflitt defeated Miss Deane 4 up
and 3 to play. Miss Mhoon drawing the
bye. In the final round Mies A. Moffltt
defeated Miss Mhoon 4 up and 3 to play
and won the tournament. The previous
winners are Miss Dunham. Miss A. Duff
and Miss A. Moffltt. Miss Dunham being
at present out of California, the final
tournament, to be held in three or four
ween.B, will he between Miss Duff and
Miss A_ Moffltt, each of whom has won
twice. The winner will become entitled
to tho absolute ownership of the ladies'
cup.
On the same day at Oakland, R. Cooke
and W. A. Magee defeated K. M. Fitz
gerald and Arthur Goodall 1 up, and won
the men's foursomes, eighteen hole*,
match play, which were begun March 4.
An elghteen-hole match was played be
tween two sides of four players each, the
winners to be entertained at dinner by
the losers. The side made up of J. A.
Folger, G. D. Greenwood, Prestes Pierce
and H. F. Knikwles won 1 up, from the
side composed of R. M. Fitzgerald, W. P.
Johnson, Arthur Goodall and E. R. Fol-
ger.
This afternoon the second home and
home match between two teams of eight
men representing the Oakland and San
Francisco Golf clubs will begin on the
Adams Point links. Each captain has al
ready furnished the other with a list of
players, giving to each a number indi
cating his rank in the team; piayers with
corresponding numbers will strike against
each other. If either club falls to appear
with a full team, the other club may
drop from ita list any player designated
by tho captain and the club that fails
to appear with a full team win be pen
alized two holes for each player it lacks.
The scores of the game to be played at
Oakland to-day and of the game to be
played in this city on Saturday, April 15,
will be added together. The San Fran
cisco team having won the contest held
on December 10 and 17, 189S, the trophy
is now held by the city club; and if it
should be again victorious the trophy will
become the permanent possession of thÂ»
San Francisco Golf Club. But If thÂ»
Oakland team is victorious a tie will re
sult, and will be played off May 13 on the
links of a third club, if the use of them
can be obtained. The trophy is a hand
some three-handled silver loving cup, to
the purchase of which each club con
tributed |25. The conditions of the match
were drawn up by William Thomas on
behalf of the San Francisco Golf Club
and by P. E. Bowles on behalf of the
Oakland Golf Club. Each club is to sup
ply eight scorers, whose duty it will be to
see that the rules of the game are ob
served. The irrepressible caddie is not to
approach within six feet of the ball and
spectators are to stand at the respectful
distance of twenty-five, yards from the
putting greens and teeing grounds.
Following is the make-up of the San
Francisco team, according to rank: S. L.
Abbott Jr., Dr. C. T. Hfbbetts, H. Bab
cock, H. D. Pillsbury, J. W. Byrne, II
B. Goodwin, C. Page and E. J." McCut
chen. The Oakland team is as follows:
B. R. Folger, G. D. Greenwood, K. M
Fitzgerald, C. P. Hubbard, D. F. Belden
J. C. McKee, R. A. Cooke and J. A. Fol
ger. The San Francisco eight is com
posed of the same players as last yea*
except that H. B. Goodman takes the
place of Lieutenant Games Roberts. R.
A. Cooke and D. F. Belden are the new
members of the Oakland team. Play will
commence at 2 p. m. Neither captain,
though entitled to do so, has named any
substitutes.
IN THE COURSING FIELD.
Two Great Stakes to Be Run Off at
Union Park.
Another great stake will be run at |
Union Park to-day and to-morrow, and I
owing: to the immense number of dog's en
tered the management decided to divide i
the stake Into an open stake of eighty j
nominations, and an overflow or extra
stake of thirty-two nominations. The I
extra stake will be. run off, commencing (
at 11 o'clock to-day, and one round will
be finished by recess. On the arrival of
the 12:55 train from the city the open
stake will be run down once, and a sec
ond round of the extra stake will be de
cided before evening. The big stake is
the highest class event ever run in Amer
ica, the dogs even outclassing those who
ran in the John Grace cup several weeks
ago. All the old-time favorites are In the
running, Including Connemara, the Bucks,
Maud S, Blackette,Flrm Friend. Metallic,
Flush and Royal Flush, and many other
greyhounds who have won honors galore
on the sward. Picking the ultimate win
ner is a difficult proposition, but Conne
mara and Maud S have the call in the
long-odds book. The uncertainties of
coursing, however, may develop a rank
outsider, but this seems hardly possible in
view of the class of dogs entered.
The capacity of Union Park to-day and
to-morrow will be taxed to its utmost by
the big crowd sure to be present.

YOUNG WIFE
KIDNAPED BY
FOUR TOUGHS
Mrs. Dottie Bernard's
Romance.
SHE IS NOW UNDER ARREST
HER HUSBAND TELLS OF HER
NAUGHTINESS.
Tire Tears Agro She "Was a Happy,
Xanoeent Bride, but .tfas Grad
ually Lured to Her
Ruin.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Hroadway. April 7.
Mrs. Dottle Bernard, a young wife and
not unattractive, gave the Police De
partment considerable trouble this after
noon. She told a romantic story of hav
ing been kidnaped, which had many ele
ments of truth in it, but It led to such un
happy developments that Mrs. Bernard
â¢was arrested some hours later aaid Is now
In the City Prison.
For nearly a week Mrs. Bernard has
been restrained of her liberty in a house
near the racetrack, and her companions
have been young fellows whose names
Ehe dots not know, with the exception of
cueâ Joe Taylor.
Mrs. Bernard first appeared at the Re
ceiving Hospital with her hands badly
cut.
"Last Tuesday evening," she said, "I
â¢was on my way home when Joe Taylor
and three companions approached me.
Taylor offered io see me home ami I con
sented. When we p;t*sed a barn the
young fellows pushed me in and locked
the door and they huve kept me there for
three days. They have only given me a
little bread and a few drinks In that time.
1 made several attempts to get out, but
could not force the door. To-day I made,
up my mind to liberate myself, so 1
forced my hand through the window, i
was so weak that 1 could not get through
the window after I had broken it. Tne
r.oise 1 made attracted the neighbors and
Police Officer Curtis liberated me."
Police det< ctlvea were put to work on
the case and the mystery was revealed
by the woman's husband. He said that
five years ago he married the young
woman, who was then a respectable,
hard-working laundress of San Francisco.
They furnished a nice home in this city
and for three years all went well. Two
ago the young wife started on the.
down track. This led to absenting her
self from home for several days at a
time.
Some weeks ago she went away and
lonian! t ame so disgusted that he
closed up his house, sold the furniture
and decided never to try' to keep his wife
straight again.
As Mrs. Bernard has no home and had
been drinking she was retained In jail

A HAIR-RAISING RUNAWAY.
Letter-carrier Littler^ Wild Ride
Which Nearly Cost Him His
Life.
OAKLAND, April 7.â Charles Littler,
one of trie best-known mall carriers in
the service, was thrown from his bugg>
and nearly killed to-day. Littler was go- j
Ing his round in Piedmont and was drlv j
Ing along Hamilton place, when part of'
the harness oroke. The effect of the ac- i
cident was to startle the horse and it ran
off at a break-neck pace, headed for Lake
.Merritt. The harness continued to part |
and Littler hung on to the reins, hoping ;
that the animal would run Into the mud 1
and be brought to a standstill.
An electric car was going the same way
and every effort was made to catch up
â¢with the frightened animal, in the hope
of heading It off. The runaway and the |
car raced for several hundred yards, i
After a mad contest the last trace parted
and Littler was thrown into the air fully '.
ten feet. He landed on his forehead oh
the car track just as the car had passed.
Llttler'B head was cut, one knee was ln^
Jured and he was almost unconscious
when picked up and put aboard a car
which speeded away for surgical aid. He
was taken to his home, and unless ther*
be some unexpected developments he will
recover. .

FABIOLA TO HAVE
ITS DERBY DAY
Lady Managers Accept the Offer of
the California Jockey Club.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 908 Broadway, April 7.
The Board of Lady Managers of Fabiola Hospital decided at a meeting
held to-day to accept T. 11. "Williams' offer of a benefit day at the racetrack.
On any day the track management selects the Fabiola Derby will be run
and the entire proceeds will be donated to the hospital fund.
There was a large attendance of the lady managers and Mrs. President
Tule was In the chair. The chief business before the meeting was the consid
eration of Mr. Williams' offer to devote the use of the track and its em
ployes for the usual May day benefit. The matter had been laid over for a
week, so the ladies came prepared to record their decisions. They were prac
tically unanimous and decided to accept Mr. Williams' offer and thank him
for his generosity. This settles the question and the white and blue of Fab
iola, the red of Derby day and the orange and black of the racing associa
tion will be mingled at Emeryville as in former years.
THOSE LIVING
PICTURES FIND
CHAMPIONS
Unity Circle Will Give
the Show.
NOW THE PROPER THING
MASON AND DRAKE DEFIED BY
THE (JNITARIAN LADLES.
The Entertainment "Will Be Made a
Great Society Event Among
the Alameda Four
Hundred.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
142S Park street. April 7.
The living picture subject refuses to be
subdued. The ladies of the Unitarian
church, in direct opposition to the views
expressed by their brothers of Christ
Church, will stand sponsors for a living
i picture entertainment. Not only will it
be given for the benefit of the church,
but the living bronze statuary will be cx
i hiblted In the auditorium of the house of
worship.
St. Agnes Guild of Christ Church had
; such a show planned, but F. E. Mason
and Flemon Drake of the vestry heard
of it and they were so shocked that the
whole business was squelched at once
to save their feelings. The gentlemen
were just recovering from their first
shock when the ladies of Unity Circle
of the Unitarian Church defied their opin
ions and it is now feared that Mr. Mason
and Mr. Drake may suffer a relapse.
The ladies will not only champion the
cause of the artists of tfghts and bronze
paint, but are determined to make the
i affair the swellest social function ever
given in the town. They propose to make
living pictures the proper thing in Ala
meda society and Mr. Mason and Mr.
Drake will have to submit to their decree
I or relinquish all claims to social leader
ship.
Unity Circle will exhibit the bronzed ar
tists Tuesday evening. April 18. The price
of admission has been place at $1 and no
one will be admitted who is not in full
. evening dress. The chairs will be ar
! ranged In groups, surrounded by palms
; and potted plants and the entire church
auditorium will be decorated In most
[ elaborate fashion. A new picture will be
shown every ten minutes. A full orches-
I tra will furnish music. Mrs. George E.
Plummer, Mrs. Emma Shattuck, Mrs. "\V.
H. Baurhytc. Mrs. E. D. Rue and Mrs.
W. O. Henn are the committee in charge
! of the affair.
CLOSING DAYS OF
ALAMEDA CAMPAIGN
COUNTY CLERK JORDAN TAKES
A HAND IN THE FIGHT.
Interest Centers on the Contest for
City Marshal and School
Directors.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, April 7.
The closing days of the city campaign
are being marked by some of the bitter
est fighting and most peculiar political
methods to which the voters of this city
have ever been subjected. The election
will be held next Monday, and the can
didates are taking advantage of every
lntervening minute to line up their forces
and round up the voters.
The city has been flooded with cam
paign circulars, some of th>m decent and
legitimate, others scurrilous and with
out sponsors. Interest is centered on
the fight for City Marshal and members
of the Board of Education. For the
Marshalship there are three candidatesâ
John Conrad, the Incumbent, who Is an
Independent candidate; 'William Gunn.
a member of the police force, nominee of
the Non-Partisan party, and George
MacÃae, a young detective, who has tne
Indorsement of the Municipal League.
For a time It was the general opinion
that Conrad would defeat the regular
nominees, but the distribution yesterday
of an anonymous circular making a llbel
ouH attack on his opponents turned the
tide of public favor against him, and the
fight now appears to be between Gunn
and MaeÃea.
The School Board fight Is attracting the
greatest attention. The Non-Partisans
are combating for the retention In office
of the present trustees. The Municipal
League wants a complete change from
School Superintendent down the line,
NOTORIOUS MUTASCOPES
INCUBATORS OF DURRANTS
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 908 Broadway, April 7.
The notorious mutascopes, depicting- indecency and staging songs of ob
scenity, have been branded by the Oakland socialists as modern incubators
that breed Durrants. The advent of the mutascope In this city dates back
only a few weeks â shortly after the embargo was placed against this mechan
ical corrupter of morals in San Francisco.
Immediately complaints of the notorious character of these devices were
heard upon every side, but no arrests yere made. Finally the matter was
brought to the attention of the socialists, and a committee, consisting of H.
J. Whittaker, John H. Eustace and Robert Graham, was appointed to inves
tigate from a standpoint of morality. V
The committee has just reported that the result of their investigation \as
been shocking. The three members visited places whore they found boys, ap
parently between the ages of 12 and 14 years, looking Into the peephole
machines, viewing pictures that were disgusting.
An effort was made to-day to secure a warrant for the arrest of the
parties conducting the places, but the committee was informed by the Pros
ecuting Attorney that there is'no law or municipal ordinance reaching the
case. Deputy District Attorney Melvin advised the crusaders that while the
law prohibited the singing of obscene sotiks there was nothing to hinder
such songrs being uttered by a mechanical contrivance, and while the drawing
and exhibition of nude figures is prohibited the law does not apply to an exhi
bition of pictures that are indecent.
Now the sociallFts will petition the City Council to pass an ordinance to
remedy the abuse by prohibiting the demoralizing exhibitions.
THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 8, 1899.
claiming that the department has been
used as a political machine by tbe Non-
Partisan candidates. Trustees C. L. Tis
dale and J. B. Lanktree and Superintend
ent D. J. Sullivan. The Municipal
League candidates are E. M. Keys
Frank Otis and J. R. Sloan.
Tisdale and Lanktree are making des
perate efforts to secure their re-election.
County Clerk Frank C. Jordan, who lives
in Oakland, has taken a hand in Mr.
Lanktree's fight, and has issued over
his own signature an appeal to the voters
to "vindicate L,anktree and silence the
detractors of our school nystem." The
citizens do not take "kindly to Mr. Jor
dan's interference in the local campaign,
and resolutions will be introduced at the
first meeting of the campaign to-morrow
night condemning his action.
The candidates for City Trustees have
been left to shift for themselves. B. J.
Smith, the independent candidate, who
promises to conduct the city government
without taxation, has taken'advantage of
the situation, jumped into the middle of
the fight and made himself a very for
midable factor in the contest. It is known
that the regular nominees for Trustees
are knifing each other, and Smith, being
the only independent candidate, is reap
ing the benefit.
The decision of the City Attorney that
no one who registered or transferred sub
sequent to March 16 could vote at Mon
day's election has disfranchised 10S citi
zens. Their names have been crossed off
the supplemental registers. Among them
is D. J. Sullivan, Superintendent of
Schools.
HEAVY TARIFF ON
SIDEWALK CYCLING
INCREASE FROM TWO TO FIVE
DOLLARS.
Abuse of cne Ordinance Has Resulted
in Many Acidents to Chil
dren.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. April 7.
The number of accidents that have
happened to ladies and children through
the carelessness of cyclists ha^j resulted
In increasing the ball for riding on the
sidewalks from $2 to $5.
An ordinance has also been introduced
In the City Council prohibiting all cy
clists from using the sidewalks at any
hour of the night or day. These measures
are of great interest to cyclists all around
the bay. many of whom are in the habit
of coming to Oakland during the summer
and patronizing her boasted miles of aide
walks. The existing ordinance makes It
a misdemeanor not to dismount or turn
out of the way of a foot passenger on the
sidewalk or not to ring a bell at a cross
ing. The maximum fine for violating this
ordinance has been $5, but the Police
Judge has permitted police officers to
collect bail of J2 and to allow the cyclist
to go on his way.
This practice has failed to Induce riders
to obey the law and several women and
children have recently been knocked
down, and in some instances severely in
jured. Judge Smith has therefore issued
an order that the maximum bail must be
exacted in every ca_se.
The new ordinance, which, it is said
will certainly be passed, prohibits any
kind of wheel from, being used on the
sidewalks except invalids' chairs and
children's toy wheels. It is claimed by
friends of the measure that the streets o"f
Oakland are now in such good condition
that there is not the excuse for riding on
the sidewalks that existed two years ago
Police Raid Gambling Dens.
OAKLAND, April 7.â The Police De
partment began to-night to carry out the
Idea of the new city administration. The
start was made on the gambling houses
and the most fashionable faro game in
the Windsor Hotel was raided by Cap
tain Morrison, Sergeant Peterson and Of
ficer Henderson. The dealer, Rodgers,
and several of the players were ar
reated. All of the latter gave fictitious
names and were released on ball. The
gambling furniture was taken to the City
Hall.
This is the first move toward reclaim
ing the city from being the "open town"
that it was under the old administration.
Fraternity House Entered.
BERKELEY, April 7.--A thief entered
the handsome new chapter house of the
Delta Kapjia Epsilon fraternity last night
and succeeded in making away with a
sum of money, together with other valua
bles. The fraternity house stands on the
corner of Durant and Telegraph avenues.
It has offered an easy mark for burglars
once or twice before.
Last night's intruder managed to get
Into the upstairs apartments of the fra
ternity men, taking away all the wearing
apparel in hight. This he searched for
loose money, netting about $150. The
clothes he threw away on leaving the
premises. They were found this morning
scattered about in the yard and In some
of the adjacent lots. A tin box containing
gold and silver was broken open and $75
taken. No clew can be found to the per
petrator of the deed. The police are of
the opinion that some one well acquainted
with the interior of the house is responsi
ble. Several months ago a Chinese ser
vant did practically the same thing and
was discharged, the goods stolen being
recovered.

CARRIE REUTER
SAYS HER SON
WAS ABDUCTED

band.
WARM CONTEST OVER A BOY
WRIT OP HABEAS CORPUS IS
SUED BY JUDGE OGDEN.
Charles Beuter's Record of Matrimo
nial Troubles Will Be Aired - '
in the Superior
Court.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 7.
Judge Ogden to-day issued a writ of j
habeas corpus directed to Charles Rev- i
ter, inspector for the Oakland Gas, Light
and Heat Company, commanding him to
produce In court before next Monday his
5-year-old son who, Mrs. Carrie M. Rev- \
ter alleges, he abducted from her home I
about two weeks ago.
Two years ago the principals were di
vorced and Mrs. Reuter was given the
custody of the child. In her petition for \
the writ Mrs. Reuter alleges that since j
the abduction her ex-husband has kept '
the boy at his residence, corner of Clay â 
and Fifteenth streets, where he is said
to be living with his third wife. She
called there to see the boy, but was re
fused admittance, and has now had her
ex-husband cited to appear and show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court.
Mrs. Reuter was formerly Miss yon j
Rowel. She was Reuters second wife and
obtained her divorce on the ground of ex
treme cruelty.
"When I called on Attorney Lucas to ;
bring suit for divorce," said Mrs. Reuter !
to-day, "he refused to take the case, and ;
my ex-husband's brother told me after
ward that he refused because he had se
cured a divorce for Reuter under the j
name of Charles J. Richards. That divorce j
was granted on December 31, 1892, just a
week prior to my marriage. The woman's
name was Maud A. Malone and he lived
with her but six months. I secured my \
divorce from him on May 26, 1897, and the j
following October he married a young
woman employed at that time at Kel
ler's."
Reuter is 27 years of age. He first mar- i
rlfu at 18 and his first wife was the !
daughter of a Buckeley, Wash., saloon- i
keeper. At 20 years of age he took his j
second wife and at 25 his third.
He declares that his ex-wife is not a
proper person to have charge of his son,
though he makes no effort to secure! the 1
little daughter, still in the care of Mrs.
Reutcr. The latter says Reuter had her
sign a paper not long since that contains
a statement to the effect that "no bad
company must be kept by the mother."
She says ho now holds this over her
head.
Reuter, however, has proved nothing
against the mother's character so far. He
has tried to settle his affairs In regard to
the boy outside of court because he
feared publicity. He denies that he ever
went under an assumed name and lays
great weight upon the document his ex
wife slgrted.
The mAtter will be aired in Judge Og
den's court next Monday and promises to
be replete with sensation.
LÂ«ft Much to Charity.

PHIZES FOE, DOGS.
Cash and Trophies Offered by the
Kennel Club.
The San Francisco Kennel Club has Is
sued Its premium list, and silver cups are
strewed profusely through the pages. The
man who owns a good dog nowadays has
a "good thing" when such rewards are
offered for Its possession as are displayed
In the pages of the premium list. And
these special prizes are only a tithe of
what will be distributed at the close of
the show, for many of the regular donors
of cups and medals reside In the East and
the announcement of their offers has not
yet reached the bench show committee.
To the professional dog-handlers the
club offers for competition the total cash
amount of $50. This will doubtless serve
to stimulate the professionals to exert
their efforts to procure entries.
In every class the regular prizes are
either medals or money. In addition to
these prizes the following specials are
offered:
For mastiffs a loving cup is offered, be
sides medals, and a long string of Pacific
Mastiff Club trophies for members of that
club.
Great Danes are favored by the first
vice president with a silver and cut-glass
loving cup and medals.
St. Bernards receive the president's
trophy, a silver loving cup. Besides this,
gold and silver medals are offered by the
Kennel Club and for the members of the
St. Bernard Club. The latter club offers
more medals and some valuable cups.
For Newfoundlands the Baltimore Ken
nel Association offers the club medal.
The San Francisco Kennel Club offers
the club medal for deerhounds, gold and
silver medals for greyhounds and fox
hounds, wolf+iounds (Borzois), blood
hounds and Chesapeake Bay dogs.
For pointers W. S. Tevls offers a silver
cup, and the Kennel Club offers medals.
For English setters the specials are the
Verona Kennels' silver and cut-gla,ss vns^
and Clabrough-Golcher's caraffe of the
same material. In addition the Kennel
Club's special medals.
Irish setters receive a silver and cut
glass tobacco jar from E. T. Allen, and
gold and silver medals from the Kennel
Club.
Gordon setters are offered the Kennel
Club's medals.
The field trial class will compete for a
silver cup offered by the Pacific Coast
Field Trials Association and for the Ken
nel Club's gold and silver medals.
Irish water and field spaniels will com
pete for the Kennel Club's special club
medals.
Cocker spaniels should be entered in
large numbers, for the variety and value
of the specials are enormous. F. P. But
ler offers a $100 oil painting of the winner.
Shreve & Co. offer a cut-glass cigarette
jar. the Kennel Club offers medals, and
the Oakland kennels offer a cut-glass and
silver pitcher.
Collies emulate the cockers in the ex
tent and value of specials. The Palace
Hotel offers a silver and cut-glass loving
cup; Henry J. Crocker, second vice presi
dent, offers a silver pitcher; the San
Francisco Kennel Club offers the special
club medals, and the California Collie
Club offers its medals for its own mem
bers.
Dalmatians, poodles, bulldogs, Boston,
Irish and Skye terriers, Japanese spaniels,
dachshunds, pugs and toy terriers all re
ceive the San Francisco Kennel Club's
special medals in addition to the regular
prizes. Yorkshire terriers will compete
also for a silver beaker.
For bull terriers the Phemeria Cocker
Kennels offer a Lenox and silver pitcher,
and the Kennel Club offers its special
medals.
A unique feature of the show will be a
parade of greyhounds in training, that
will compete for silver cups.
A carload of dogs from the Eastern cir
cuit is expected to arrive here.' The en
tries of these dogs for competition are al
ready on the way. It is safe to assert
that the total of entries will surpass last
year by 50 per cent, and judging from the
number that have already been filed it is
not extravagant to expect a doubling of
the number. The applications for pre
mium lists have been so far in excess of
the anticipation that a second edition has
been necessitated.
A feature of the show will be the auc
tion sale of dogs on the last day.

PIRTELLE SAYS
WRIGHT STOLE
HIS WIFE AWAY
A Larkspur Capitalist Is Sued
for Heavy Damages.
The Woman Confessed to Her Husband
That She Was Unable to Resist Her
Pursuer's Influence.
Charles W. "Wright, one of the wealth
iest residents of Larkspur, Marin County,
jind president of the American Land and
Trust Company, with offices at 132 Market
street, in this city, Is posed as more than
an Unary villain in a suit filed yester
day at San Rafael. The plaintiff is Wil
liam H. Purtelle, also a resident of Lark
spur, and publisher in this city of several
building trades journals. lie sues Wright
for $10,000 damages, charging that his
wealthy neighbor debauched his wife,
May Purtelle, and ruined his home.
The plaint la sensational enough in
Itself, but the testimony promised in sup
port of its allegations Is even more so, in
cluding, as it will, the testimony of Pur
telle, a private detective In his employ,
the wife and one other, to the effect that^
the Larkspur landowner was caught with
>lre. Purtelle in a room in a well known
upper Kearny street lodging house only
a week ago yesterday.
ISefore that exposure the wife had made
a voluntary confession to her husband.
She admitted that she had bean unfaith
ful, and without saying so in so many
words had painted a picture of Wright
that has no prototype other than Sven
gali. She did not like the man, she said,
sind dreaded his approach, but sucn a
dread influence did he exert over her
that she could do nothing but submit to
him.
Purtelle is 38 years of age. iJis wife Is
L'u. a nr>t unhandsome and slender little
â¢u.i;..ii!. They were married, accoring to
implaint, at Vancouver, H. C, in

Then, the plaintiff alleges, "<>n or about

intending to Injure the plaintiff and to
deprive him of the comfort, society, aid
if his wife, and in the first
ir.sta:. eged forcibly and with
out tl of the said May Purtelle,
wickedly, willfully and maliciously de
bauched the said May Purtelle."
This allegation is based entirely on the
confession of the wife, made two weeks
ago, as a result of which the Purtelles

separated, the wife leaving the cottage
at Larkspur to reside in this city, in
impfaint the husband charges that
"Wricht maliciously enticed .her away and
"has ever Bincd a< tamed and harbored
her."
The confession was made one evening
after Purtelle had taken her to task
about certain familiarities he thought he
had noticed Wright Caking with her. She
denied at first, but when the husband in
sisted that he could not have been mis
taken the woman broke down. She cried
piteously and admitted that she had
wronged him. Wright was the cause, she
said; she had not intended to sin, but
in his hands she was wax to be molded
to any mood. _ _ , ;
Shortly after she and her husband had
moved into their Larkspur cottage, she
â¢said, Wright's attentions had begun. His
chosen times of approach were those
when her husband was in the city. She
knew, she said, that the man meant her
wrong, and she avoided him as much as
possible. He was persistent, she added,
BO much so that, not content with calling
at the house, from which she prevented
him from entering time and again by
locking the door, he would follow her into
the wood? close at hand when she went
for firewood.
At last, Mrs. Purtelle declared to her
husband. Wright abandoned persuasion
and tried force and succeeded in his de
sign. Prom that time forward,, according
to the complaint, Wright's relations With
Mrs. Purtelle "were accomplished by said
defendant under menace and duress and
threats of exposure."
Just whai were the feelings of Purtelle
at this revelation are not known, lit
tlj denounced his wife and she lefi
him, as he alleges, at the instigation of
Wright, and Is now in this city making
own iiving. The husband, whether
doubting the woman who had confessed
her unfaithfulness or being unwilling to
act without proof, called upon an attor
ney, who advised him that the only rea
sonable method of satisfying himself of
tin true condition of affairs was to em
ploy a detective.
Purtelle acted upon this advice. The
tive was engaged to shadow Mis.
Purtelle, and did so so faithfully that
a week ago yesterday all th< evidence
the husband thought necessary was
â¢ d in his possesion. The detective
had followed Wright and Mrs. Purtelle
to the Hobson House, 417 Kearny Btreet,
where they had taken a room. He no
tified the husband, and together they
proceeded to the door behind which the
couple were concealed, un the demand
of th^ proprietor of the house the door
was opened and Wright and Mrs. Pur
â¢â¢ â  r< revealed.
The scene was dramatic in its intensity.
The husband, who had so long controlled
his feelings, rushed at his erstwhiie
neighbor, attempting to strike him.
Wright jumped back and falling upon the
!â¢â¢ d with his hands and heels in the air
attempted to explain.
"Hold on, Purtelle," he is said to have
exclained. "Hold on; we were only hold
ing a i onsultation on a business matter."
Purteile was restrained by the detec
tive and the lodging-house proprietor and
taken from the room, the others vacating
uickly as possible. Saturday morn-
Ing Purtel upon his attorneys
and instructed them to file suit for dam
si Wright. Shortly after leav
ing his lawyers Purtelle claims he re
ceived an intimation from Wright that
is ready to .-vttle. Purtelle referred
him to bis counsel. In a conversation
Liter over the telephone Purtelle's at
torney .-ays he told Wright he would
no] talk of settlement until the Larkspur
â  is; - , i w fit to secure an attorney
and make the terms before a notary and
igrapher.
After that conversation nothing was
heard by Purtelle or his attorneys from
Wright, and the suit was filed as soon
as the complaint could be drawn, which
concludes: "That by reason of the prem
ises the plaintiff has been and still is
wrongfully deprived by the defendant of
the comfort, society and aid of his said
wife, and has suffered great humiliation
and flistress of body and mind in con

DEATH TAKES AWAY
A FAIR, YOUNG LIFE
Miss Romietta Wallace Succumbs
to Heart Failure After Four
Hours' Illness.
MISS ROMIETTA WALLACE, the youngest daughter of Judge and Mrs.
William T. Wallace, died at her home. 7:6 Van Ness avenue, Thursday
evening. Death came like a flash, and when the news of the untimely
demise Bpread throughout the city yesterday it was regarded as a ter
rible mistake by hundreds of the young lady's friends. The Judge and his
wife are heart-broken over their loss. Only a few years ago another
daughter, just ripening into womanhood, was taken from them, and the in
tensity of their present grief can scarcely be realized.
Miss Wallace had been apparently in the best of health until about 4
o'clock Thursday afternoon. While conversing with her father she suddenly
complained of feeling ill. and soon afterward was taken with a spasm. Medi
cal aid was summoned, and Dr. Thorn arrived at the house a few moments
afterward. His efforts and skill proved unavailing, and his patient gradu
ally sank, and died at 8:15 p. m., a little more than four hours after she had
first noted her indisposition. The cause of death was heart failure.
Miss Wallace was one of the best known young ladies in the fashion
able circles of this city. She possessed a lovable disposition which en
deared her to all. and her charming personality and lofty accomplishments
made her popular wherever she went. She was but 23 years of age and was
educated at Sacred Heart College. At a ball given November 21, 1896, by her
parents, Miss Wallace made her debut into society. The. affair was one of
the most notable functions of the season.
At her deathbed were her parents, her sister CMrs. John F. Sheehan) and
her brother, Richard Wallace. Another sister. Mrs. Richard Sprague, is in
New York, and her other brother, Ryland Wallace, is absent in Europe.
Both of the latter received the sad intelligence by telegraph.
The funeral services will be held this morning from the family residence
at S o'clock. An hour later a special car. attached to the 9 o'clock train, will

THE LATEST JOB.
Return Checks Were Given the Spec

Be Refunded by the Club
Without Belay.
Dictator Billy Smith, the mysterious
ear-chewer and champion jo'o fighte- of
America, by courtesy of Captain Jamrs
Gillin nf the police force was granted the
privilege last evening of entering the
ring at Woodward's Pavilion in civilian's
dress and announcing to a generous sport
ing public that because of the meager at
tendance he would not fight Green.
The ultimatum of the dictator was
greeted with hoots and yells of "Put niri
out of the house!" "Smith has got cold
feet!" and other remarks which are not
printable.
To the credit of Green it must be ra-d
that he was satisfied to fight Smith in
accordance with the articles of agree
ment, to which ho had attached his sig
nature. They read as follows:
"We, the parties of the second part,
agree to box twenty (20) rounds for a de
cision, Marquis of Queensberry rules, for
and in consideration of sixty-live (65) per
cent of the gross receipts to be derived
from the admission fee to said exhibi
tion; the said gross receipts to be divid
ed between said parties of the second part
as follows, to wit: The winner to take
seventy-five per cent and the loser to take
twenty-five per cent."
There is not a single line in the articles
which stipulates that in case of a limited
attendance the club should guarantee the
fighters any particular sum other than
what the percentage of the house call.-d
for.
But Mr. Smith, the bully pugilist, bar
room scrapper, etc., had the audacity to
i o c - ma vu < l foi \ his services a guarantee of
$J.tOO before he would condescend to entr*
the ring and carry out an agreement to
which he had attached his signature
Such men as Smith should be cast aside
as a nuisance and disturber by all clubs
that contemplate the giving of boxing en
tertainments. His record speaks Cor it

owing to the foul tactics he employed
were lost. His hghts with Green at ('arson
and with Lavignein this city are not above
suspicion. Previous to his fight in Carson
he telegraphed a particular friend in this
city, who had nursed his first wife on her
sick bed, to bet money on Green, and
when he was training for his fight with
Lavigne in Alameda he sent, the same
friend $200 in notes with instructions to
place it on him. Lavigne was satisfied
that Smith could whip him. hut expect

It is about, time that the boxing clubs
of San Francisco deal with tbese hippo
drome pugilists and vagrants with an iron
hand. It is not many years ago whfii
first-class fighters battled to a finish for
a $500 purse with the California Athletic
Club, and then there was no such thing

PLANS FOR A
GIANT GENERATOR
OF ELECTRICITY
It Will Be Without a
Rival.
A REVELATION IN MACHINERY
NEW ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY
BEGINS WORK.
Modern Appliances Will Enable the
Competitor in Light and Tele
phone Service to Establish
Reductions in Prices.
Rapid progress is being made by the
Independent Electric Light and Power
Company in preparing for the actual
work of competition in the local field
of telephone service, electric heating
and lighting. Under instructions
from Claus Spreckels and sugges
tions from Engineer M. Hunt, the
firm of Charles C. Moore & Co. is
designing plans for what shall be
the most modern and most effective
steam plant on the Pacific Coast. This
plant will be without a rival west of
the Rocky Mountains and will have few
equals in the United States. It will
have all of the best features of the best
plants of similar character in the coun
try and will have none of their defects.
In its construction the finest and most
modern machinery known to mechani
cal engineers will be used. While it
will be the most expensive plant for
the production of electricity on the
coast, it will still be the most economi
cal, as it is estimated that it will be
capable of generating electricity at a
cost of from 15 to 50 per cent less than
any other existing plant on the coast.
In the construction and' location of
the new plant two factors of the great
est importance have entered. The new
company, much more fortunate than
the corporation? with which it will
compete for public patronage, will have
the advantage of an unlimited coal and
water supply practically without cost:
Instead of being forced to pump water
a distance of more than a mile, the
new company will have at the door of
its power house more water than it
will need. Instead of being compelled
to haul coal at great expense, the new
company will be able to transfer with
out cost all its coal from the dock to
the grates beneath the boilers.
In this way enormous expense will
be saved. Even without the advantage
of the best machinery in the market
these savings would place the new
company in the field as a formidable
competitor. In â¢ many respects the
steam plant of the new company will
be a revelation to the people of the
coast. Nothing like It is in existence
in the West and one must travel f.
New York to see its equal and find any-
referee?" The club had its referee, and it"
the fighters attempt.il "a fake" they
were thrown out of the ring and disquali
fied from entering the club in future.
But how different the state of affairs at
the present day! The pugs insist upon
selecting their own referee and gulling
the gullible lovers of the same by ex
hibitions of hippodrome which, fortu
nately, have about seen their end so far
as this city is concerned.
The McCoy and Choynski prearranged
affair had i"ts effect on last night's at
tendance. And to this may be added the
"Kid" Lavigne-Walcott fake, the "Kid"
Lavigne-Tracey fake, and the "Kid" I>a
vigne-Billy Smith fake of rather recent
date.
It is not to be wondered at that the
people of San Francisco who patronizr
the game have at last grown weary of
bunko fights, and it is safe to say that
until the clubs appoint their own referees
hippodromes will be given to the good
natured but unsuspecting public.
After a couple of tame preliminary
sparring bouts, which were put on at 8:30,
the crowd was kept waiting fifty-five
minutes before any further excitement
was offered. Then Green came from his
dressing-room with his seconds, Frank
Foster and Bob McArthur. and took a
seat in one of the corners of the ring. !!â â 
sat there for about ten minutes, when
Announcer Billy Jordan came forward
and, raising his hand, said:
"Gentlemen, when this match was made
Mr. Green and Mr. Smith agreed to box
for 65 per cent of the receipts. Now, then.
Mr. Smith says there is not enough money
in the house "and he will not box for what
is here; but he will box if he is guaran
teed a $2500 purse. Now, then, I
do not see anything for you to
do except, as the manager says,
to go down to the box office and pet a
ticket for the next contest." " This last
sentence was received with prolonged
hoots and hisses. "No, no!" yelled some.
"Money back." yelled others.
Smith then pushed his way through the
crowd and clambered between the ropes,
li. was dressed In street costume and ap
parently had no Idea of fighting. He was
roundly hissed and hooted, and Police
Captain Gillen had to come forward and
call for order before he could be heard.
When quiet was restored Smith said. "I
refuse to go on unless there is fSSOO guar
anteed." after which he turned and
climbed out of the ring. Smith could not
have felt very much flattered at the way
his statement was received, for the feel
ings of the crowd were anything but
friendly toward him.
Green's turn came next. As he passed
through the ropes to go to his dressing
room he was loudly cheered, and turning
raised his voice and said. "I am willing*
to go on for what is in the house, and I
think thi' National Club ought to pay me
my end of the purse." The crowd evi
dently thought so, too, for his remarks
were applauded.
This was the end of the fiasco. Slowly
the crowd began filing out of the build
ing. At the box office each man was
handed a return check. Whether this
will be exchangeable for the money paid
in or whether the club management will
try to force its proposition of giving
tickets good for some fight to come WiM
not be decided until to-day. The National
Club has no contest billed or date set for
any future contest.
Business men and others left their
homes last evening expecting: to have an
entertainment, instead of which they
were treated to a bald fiasco. If the
managers of the National Club want to
do the square thing there is no course left
open to them but to immediately return
the money of every ticket' holder
at last night's contest. ' Further
more, they should hereafter, if
they attempt to promote other
fights, secure from the men matched a
certain cash guarantee that they will ap
pear, to be forfeited to the other man
should either man fail to e-o on. Had this
been done before, last night's disappoint
ment would not have occurred, uiboa and
Groom owe it to the public that support
their entertainments to see that pome
protection like this is afforded, and if
they do not' do so the attendance at fu
ture contests under their management
will be even smaller than it was last
night.
The proposed henvy-woight preliminary
bout between Jim Jeffries and Al Collins
was declared off early in the evening
Drs. Lustlg and Jones examined the men
and stated that Collins' heart was weak,
and that it would be a mistake for him
to fight. So the crowd got absolutely
nothing for its money.
The betting on the Smith-Green fake
closed at 10 to 6^, with Smith on the long

The new plant will be of the very
highest grade throughout and when in
stalled will be the most modern power
station on the coast. It is estimated
that the new company will not only be
able to supply the wants of the city in
electric power, heat and light, but will
be able as well to furnish power to its
competitors. The class of machinery
that will be installed is the most ex
pensive in the market, yet by the use
of superior economical devices will gen
erate electricity at the tremendous re
duction already indicated.
The firm which has the work in hand
has been commissioned to supply for
the new company Babcock & Wilson
â¢boilers of forged steel construction
throughout and capable of carrying a
working steam pressure of 250 pounds.

TALKED FOR PROHIBITION.
Orator Stewart Speaks of Saloons as
"a National Sin."
Hon. Oliver W. Stewart of Illinois, the
well-known Prohibitionist orator, ad
dressed a considerable audience at Pyth
ian Castle last night. He held that the
existence of saloons was "a national sin,"
for which the individual was responsible.
He was not in favor of any compro
mise with the liquor trafic, advocating
its complete extermination. Restrictions
by law, he declared, were simply a modi
fied form of Government protection to the
saloons. He is a forcible speaker and
closely holds the attention of his auditors
from beginning to end.
