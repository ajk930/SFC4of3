JOHN SHERMAN
IS NOT DEAD
BUT VERY ILL
Nobody Knows Where the
Story of His Death
Came From.
HIS FAMILY REJOICES
Mrs. Sherman Alone Was Not Told
the First and Most Alarming .
Story.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March
21, 7 p. m. â There is no truth
in the statements published in
the United States, and cabled back
here, representing that John Sher
man is dead:
It is incomprehensible how these
reports originated. The American line
-steamer Paris, Captain Frederick
Watkins, arrived here this evening
before dark, and it was immediately
reported that Mr. Sherman was not
only alive, but better, resting easily,
end expected to recover.
He will be transferred, if all goes
â¢well, to the United States cruiser
Chicago on Thursday. The cruiser is
"now coaling at Kingston, Jamaica-
"WASHINGTON, March 21.â Seldom
has official Washington been more
completely stirred by conflicting emo
tions than it was to-day by the an
nouncement, first of the death of Hon.
John Sherman, and then by the con
tradiction of the report which came a
few hours later, the one giving a relief
which was as marked as was the sor
row produced by the other.
The first report, which came from
New York, was received at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon and was circulated in
the departments just before they closed ,
for the day. The announcement !
seemed to follow naturally the other j
cablegrams of the day stating that the \
venerable statesman's condition had !
grown worse since yesterday, and there
was a universal expression of regret ;
and. in many cases, of personal dis
tress over the news. Cabinet Ministers,
Senators and members of the House j
expressed deep sorrow, speaking not I
only in terms of admiration and respect
for the ex-Senator's .public career, but ,
avfelimg with loving kindness upon his ,
personal character.
The contradiction of the first report
did not arrive until 8:30 o'clock.. It
came to the Associated Press in th*
ape of a positive statement from j
Santiago, made in the knowledge that i
the report of the Senator's death had
been circulated. This dispatch was im
mediately given as wide circulation in
the city as it was possible for it to re- j
ceive at that hour. Secretary Hay was
placed in possession of a copy of the |
dispatch, as were also Mr. Sherman's i
family.
"A most marvelous condition of af
fairs," remarked the Secretary.
"He then proceeded to express his
great relief that the first news was not
confirmed. â¢
The news of the reported death of
Mr. Sherman took many persons,
friends and others, to his home on X
6*reet. Among others who were con
gregated there when the reporter of
the Associated Press called were the
former private secretaries of Mr. Sher
man Mr. Babcock and Mr. Vaile, a3
-ell as Miss Kate Willock, a niece, and
Mrs. Colonel Charles Hoyt, whose hus
band was a cousin of Senator Sher
man They and others present read
the dispatch stating that the Senator
was still alive with great joy.
The reading of the glad message' had
scarcely been concluded by those pres
ent when Mrs. McCullom, the adopted
daughter of Senator and Mrs. Sherman,
burst into the room, accompanied by
the daughter of General Miles. They
had received the news through a tele
phone message from the Associated
Press while at General Miles house
and had hurried over to impart it to
the rest of the family.
"It has been a trying day. said Mrs.
McCullom, "but all is well again.'
Indeed there were heartfelt rejoicings
and thanksgivings on the part of those
â who had assembled at the house when
they realized it was true that the .In
valid was better and might be restored
to them. , ..
Mrs Sherman is the one person of the
ex-Senator's household who suffered
neither from the first announcement or
rejoiced over the second. She was not
Informed of either. Mrs. Sherman has
been quite ill from a stroke of paralysis
for several months and had not been
informed of the ex-Senator's illness for
fear of its effect upon her. It was felt
â¢when the news of his death came to
day that it would have to be broken
to her but all hesitated to make the
announcement. It was ultimately de
cided to postpone the sad duty until
to-morrow. She was thus saved the
shock. , - ,
Already many telegrams of con
dolence and personal calls of sympathy
had been received at the house.
Prompt efforts were taken by the
Associated Press to inform the prom
inent officials of the administration and
others of the safe arrival of Mr. Sher
man at Santiago, and It was with a
feeling of genuine gratification and sat
isfaction that this news was received,
supplemented by an expression of hope
that Mr. Sherman would entirely re
cover. _________

LONDON, March 21.â A dispatch to
Lord Cromer, British diplomatic agent
in Egypt, embodying the reply of the
Sirdar, General Lord Kitchener of
Khartoum, to questions regarding the
alleged mutilation and useless slaugh
ter of dervishes in the battle of Omdur
man, has been laid before Parliament.
The Sirdar says that the only wound
ed dervishes killed by his troops were
those who feigned death in order to ob
tain opportunities for killing the Anglo-
Egyptians.
"Whatever was done," he continues,
"was done with all possible considera
tions of humanity."
The Sirdar Justified the destruction of
the tomb of the Mahdi and the.dis
position. of the prophet's remains on the
ground that if the mausoleum had been
left' intact and unprofaned it would
have become the center of fanatical
pilgrimages, causing endless . trouble.
He says he himself ordered the demoli
tion. *

LOS ANGELES, March 21.â When the
Police Commission met this morning
Mayor Eaton, as ex-officio chairman,
presided. The same old fight over sa
loon licenses and infractions came up.
At one stage. of the proceedings Mayor
Eaton startled the session by declaring
in a resonant voice: --Â«.-J. .'.-.
"A woman has as much right as a
man to go into a saloon and get a
drink, if she wants to; but we shall
insist that she go in the same door
the men use and drink in the same
room as the men."
The Mayor said that If the board in
tended to enforce the "one entrance
only" rule on drinking places, a be
ginning might as well be made with
each place that had been complained
against as a disorderly rendezvous for
dissolute females and \ characterless
men. In reply to one offender the
Mayor said: *
"You must close up every door but
the front door of your saloon."
When an officer was giving testimony
he was cut short by Commissioner
Parker, who said: ;;^ ; V ; ;: â 
"We don't want any opinions from
officers. All we want from them is
facts, and we will form the opinions."
The saloon men, who feel a gradual
tightening of the law's grip, are not
jubilant. â  : â  ' "

Lieutenant James Adams; injured
about the hips by falling down stairs.
A group of- happy women, busy with
the affairs of the secret . order with
which they were affiliatedâ the State
Lodge of the Maccabeesâ were in a
moment brought face to face with
death. Sixty seconds later seven of
them lay burned- and bleeding on the
pavement to which they had dropped,
thirty feet below, and the others were
rescued after they had been more or
less severely injured in their desperate
dash down the single flight of stairs
that led to safety.
The blaze started just after 3 o'clock
from a gasoline stove explosion in a
room in the rear of the third floor of
the building and next to the elevator
shaft. It was not discovered until it
had spread to the adjoining apart
ments and the entire floor was filled
wfth smoke and flames.
About twenty members of the wo
men's lodge of Maccabees were attend
ing a committee meeting in the wait
ing room in the front of the building
on the same floor. They were uncon
scious of danger until a janitor threw
open the door and told them to get out
before the flames cut them off. . The
warning came too late. The fire swept
through the door and down the single
stairway. Those nearest the door fled
through the blinding smoke and reached
the street with hands and face burned
and blistered. The rest faced a solid
wall of flame.
There was a fire escape at the south
front of the building, but not one of
them seems to have thought of It.
They rushed panic stricken to the win
dows, through which the smoke was al
ready pouring in suffocating puffs.
The fire was scarcely a foot behind
them. It caught their clothing and
scorched their faces with increasing in
tensity. .-.â "'._ .-â â¢.
In another Instant the spectators, at
tracted by the clouds of smoke, were
horrified to see one after another spring
from the open windows and fall heav
ily to the pavement. Not one arose.
They lay in an inert and apparently
lifeless heap until carried into the of
fice of a physician across the street.
Most of them were bleeding from se
vere cuts and bruises and all were
burned until their torn and blackened
skin hung in shreds.
In a few minutes all except Mrs. Tay
lor recovered* consciousness, and phy
sicians and nurses, hastily summoned,
did all that was possible to relieve
their sufferings. As fast, as hasty
dressings could be applied the victims
were taken to the Clarkson Hospital by
the ambulances. The body of Mrs. Tay
lor was taken to the Morgue and others
whose injuries were less severe were
treated at a neighboring drug store and
at the offices of downtown physicians.
Aside from the fatalities arid the.in
juries 'to persons, the fire was not a se
rious one. Few of the losers are able
to place an exact estimate on their
losses, but the total will not exceed
$50,000. The loss on the building is less
than half that sum. and aside from
that the heaviest losers are the pro
prietors of the Boston Store, who had
a large surplus stock in the basement
of the block. . The loss of the various
secret societies that occupy the halls
on the second and third floors is large
ly by water and smoke and is diffi
cult to estimate. One lodge of the A.
O. U. W.. two lodges of Bed Men, two
lodges of the Degree of Honor, four
lodges of Maccabees and several others
iost regalia and various items of furni
ture." The building Is insured up to the
80 per cent clause and most of the other
losses are largely . covered by Insur
ance.

Indiana is leaving now for Negros with one battalion of the

ILOILO, Panay Island. March 21.â A scare is reported in the
Island of Negros. Upward of sixty Spanish refugee planters have ar

Montescos River, twenty miles south of Bacoloc, threatens to destroy
haciendas and crops. They have few firearms, being mostly equipped
with spears, and bows.
The Spaniards requested arms from General Miller to defend them
selves and their property.
There is no change* the situation here. The wounded men are re

VOLUNTEERS STILL

tor left 20th. Grant delayed for necessary
repairs: starts 25th; carries all sick and
wounded necessary to ship. Sherman ex-
pected to-night. Cannot commence ship
ment of volunteers at present. Hope to
do so soon. Ship additional battalion of
the. California Regiment to Negro*- this
afternoon. OTIS.
The War and Navy departments have
not received any detailed information
as to the reason for dispatching the
California battalion under Lieutenant
Colonel Victor Duboce to re-enforce
Lieutenant Colonel Smith at Negros.
A War Department officer said to
day, "Colonel Jim Smith seems to be
up against the real thing," but this
officer admitted that he had no in
formation as to. the actual condition of
affairs in the island of Negros.
The hope of General Otis that he may
end the war in the Philippines before
the rainy season sets in is shown by
his statement that he expects to begin
. the shipment of volunteers In the im
mediate future. War Department offi
cials say the fact that he does not ship
them is considered by others as mean
ing that the resistance offered by.
Agulnaldo's troops was of a very sub
stantial character.
The towns of Bais and Bagnan have
been garrisoned, but there is evidently
a strong probability of attack in force
by the Filipinos and precautions are
being taken. It, is Secretary Alger's
hope to get the volunteers started
home by April 1, but the exigencies of
war may forbid.

FATE OF PRISONERS
' ; IN HANDS OF OTIS
NEW YORK, March 21.â A Washing
tori special to the Herald says: Major
General Otis and other members of the
Philippine Commission will decide
whether or not the ransom of the Span
ish prisoners held by Aguinaldo is to be
permitted.
As a result of representations by Em
bassador Cambon and the National Red
Cross Society showing the deplorable
condition of these prisoners. General
Otis will be given power to act after
advising with his associates on the
commission. Th**- President hopes it
may be found possible to obtain the re
lease of the prisoners, but does not wish,
to give General Otis direct instructions
in view of his former objection on the
ground that it would give Aguinaldo
a means to secure military supplies.
There are said to be about 500 Span
ish prisoners, most of them priests. As
the Filipinos blamed the priests for
most of the hardships they suffered un
der Spanish rule, they are particularly
inhuman in their treatment of the
churchmen.
the neighboring buildings came hun
dreds of frightened people.
The Fire and Police departments
quickly responded to an alarm. The
injured men were assisted to the hos
pital. The faces of the six were black
from soot and dirt. They were evident
ly exactly over the heated boiler when
the explosion came.
The responsibility rests upon a Jap
anese employed in a. saloon of the
building. He left the place with a
roaring fire and the theory is that the
water in the boiler gave out, resulting
in the explosion.

LOS ANGELES, March 21.â A warrant

SHOT HIS MAN
IN COLD BLOOD
Tragedy in a Chicago
Cafe.
JEALOUSY WAS THE CAUSE
HARRY HAMMOND TRIES TO
MURDER SHAYNE.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 21.â John T.
Shayne, a wealthy furrier and a prom
inent Democratic politician, was shot
and probably fatally wounded this
afternoon by Harry Hammond, a mer
chant tailor. The shooting occurred in
the cafe of the Auditorium Annex,
where Shayne was sitting at lunch with
Mrs. Hammond, the divorced wife of
Hammond, and two other ladies.
Mr. Shayne was shot in the* back as
he sat at the table. He fell under the
table and Hammond, pulling up the
tablecloth, deliberately fired two more
bullets into the helpless man. He then
walked out into the office of the hotel
where he stood waiting the arrival of
an officer. He was quickly placed under
arrest and taken to the Harrison-street
station, where he declined to make any
statement.
Shayne, who was a widower, had been
in company with Mrs. Hammond a
great deal since her divorce from Ham
mond and there was talk of an
approaching marriage between them.
Mrs. Hammond secured a divorce
from Hammond nearly a year ago on
the ground of habitual drunkenness.
No cause for the shooting is known un
less it can be attributed to Hammond's
jealousy of his divorced wife.
All three bullets struck Shayne in the
back and it was at first the opinion of
the doctors that his death was inevit
able in a short time. Later, however,
they declared that he had a chance if
blood poisoning does not set in.
ENRAGED CHINESE
OUST THEIR JOSS
Wreak; Vengeance Upor> an Idol
Because It Heeded Not Their
Prayers,
TACOMA, March Because he turned a deaf ear to the supplica- â 
tions of pigtailed adorers, the god of the Anacortes Chinatown has been Â«
dethroned and thrown by the wayside. Several weeks ago things did ft
not go well with the Chinese colony at Anacortes. They went into their 2g
Joss house and prayed fervently. Dozens of candles were burned, but g
still salmon did not commence running and neither did springtime come, â
enabling the Chinese to get employment at good wages. . . -.- &
In a fit of frenzy Chinese leaders pulled the idol down and threw him o
into the brush outside of the Joss house. ' For several weeks his pedes- 0
tal has been vacant, but by to-morrow a new one will be installed in his g
Pa when things go wrong with the devout but heathen ; Chinese they g
do not turn atheists as white men do. They merely discharge their god g
and get a new one. In this instance they sent to Portland, where a g
supply of the particular Chinese wood used In Joss making is kept on ,3
hand Several Chinese artists were employed to carve out a hideous M
new idol To-day it was sent to Anacortes 'tween decks of the steamer A
North Pacific, along with seventy chattering Chinamen going to that g
town to begin their season's salmon fishing. This week it will be set g
up and Anacortes Chinese will again be able to worship according to g
the dictates of their consciences. , 8

Dougherty in the County Jail to-day.
JailCr Dougherty was taking Tracy
from his cell to the courtroom, where
he was to plead to the several indict
ments, when Tracy drew a revolver and
quietly said: "Unlock the corridor, or
I'll kill you."
This move on the part of Tracy was
presumably to release the other pris
oners confined in the corridors await
ing trial that â¢ they - might escape
in the confusion. Dougherty, in- I
stead* of obeying -the command,
quickly dropped on his knees. Just
as the Jailor dropped- -Tracy fired
and the ball whiz?ed by his ear. This
attracted the attention of Deputy Sher
iff Jordan,, who stood close by. : Jordan
fired three shots at Tracy, but his re
volver refused to operate longer. Tracy
took a shot at Jordan and. ran around
toward the north corridor.
In the meantime the Jailor rushed
into his office, obtained another weapon
and followed Tracy. As he came in
sight of him the outlaw threw up his
hands, shouting:
"Don't shoot; I'll surrender.'
The rattle of the discharge of firearms
brought all the deputies from the Sher
iff's office, but not before Dougherty
had his prisoner disarmed.
Tracy Is wanted in Denver, Salt Lake
and several other Western cities on
charges of murder, robbery and burg
lary. _______________________

Five Victims of the New York Hotel

NEW YORK, March Three bodies
were recovered from the ruins of the
Windsor Hotel to-day. They were badly
charred and great difficulty is being ex

now five bodies at the morgue, each
tagged with a number, which, with the
known dead, brings the list to fifteen. The
list of missing is still very large, num

at the hospitals are all recovering.
Although the work of clearing away the
debris is progressing as rapidly as possi

400 men was made, that but a small part
of the ruins had been removed. An effort
was made to pull down the, section of the

unsuccessful. Lines are drawn all around

More Evidence to Show That
Miles Has the Right Side in
the Controversy.
CHICAGO, March 21.--_"he Govern
ment court of inquiry to-night exam
ined two witnesses with reference to
the beef questionâ Dr. Nicholas Senn
and Lieutenant Colonel A. W. Corliss.
Dr. Senn entirely disapproved of can
ned roast beef as an army ration for
any length of time, and Colonel Corliss
told of the soldiers' dislike of it. The
court will hold an all day session to

to-morrow evening or Thursday morn-
ing. The remaining witnesses will be
those suggested by Major Lee in be
half of Major General Miles. â¢
Dr. Nicholas Senn of Chicago, who
served in Cuba and Porto Rico, testified
that the troops in Cuba lived largely
on canned roast beef and bacon. He
had every reason to believe that the
canned beef was not roasted but boiled.
It was tasteless and certainly appeared
to lack nutritive qualities, as was ap
parent from the condition of the men
who returned from Cuba to Montaukâ
men who had never been ill. but were
greatly emaciated. He believed that
the meat was overdone â that there was
some fault in the process of prepara
tionâthat the process had not been
perfected. The bacon was of good
quality. He could say nothing about
refrigerator beef, because he did not
see any of it in Cuba or Porto Rico.
He made no formal inspection of the
canned roast beef, but had eaten some
of it, and his statements were based
on his own experience.
He thought one of the meat supplies
of the future for the army should be
dried beef. Men could be fed once or
twice a week on canned roast beef
without ill-effect to their health, but as

is very formidable.
The workmen have succeeded in clear

distance of about twenty feet toward the
interior of the i mass and to a distance
downward over this territory to the ceil
ing of the cellar. They had struck at in
tervals what appeared to be partition
walls, and to-night are digging around
them toward the ground. â¢_.__..
The servants of the hotel were for the
most part on the top floor of the Forty
seventh street side, and the workmen
have unearthed many articles of cheap
clothing, and cheap jewelry as well, which
evidently belonged to. the domestics. It
was estimated that at the speed with
which the work is progressing at present
It will be at least a week before the pile
will have been gone over, and it may be
longer. All during the night articles of
more or less value were brought to the
surface and turned over to the police
men who were stationed about to receive
and take them to the station house to

able of the articles are turned over to the

how to make real roast beef, he
thought it would be an excellent thing,
but not as an exclusive diet.
In reply to General Davis, the wit
ness said that he saw no evidence of
the use of chemicals in the canned
roast beef. He had heard of cases of
ptomaine intoxication, but did not see
any. Ptomaines would not develop if
the meat were thoroughly sterilized

meat should keep . twenty-four hours.
It would not be safe to eat It after

In answer to questions of Colonel
Gillespie, the witness said he really

he ate in Porto Rico was refrigerator
meat or native. He thought it was
the latter. The meat was wholesome
and palatable.

that he was shot on the Ist of July

"Up to that time," he said, "we got

The meeting of the President and

PECULIAR MANIA

SAN RAFAEL, March 21.â Joseph Azevedo, the man who was ar
rested yesterday by Sheriff Taylor after having been . taken from a
ledge on a high cliff, was examined by Drs. W. F. Jones and J. Wick
man to-day and declared insane. .He was committed to the Mendocino
Asylum by Judge Angellottl. Azevedo's trunk, brought from San Pedro
Point contained $417. District Attorney Mc-Isaac will petition the court

The delusion of the maniac is that he is divinely appointed to kill a

face.
It is not supposed that Mr. McKinley
would avoid a meeting with the former
Speaker, nor is it to be considered that
Mr. Reed would break away into the
woods to keep from meeting the Presi
dent in the middle of the big road, but
neither of them would purposely go out
of his way to meet the other.
That the two leading members of the
Republican party are not upon friendly
terms, either personally or politically,
is a well-known fact, and why they
should meet, not apparently by ac
cident, but by advanced planning, is,
in the' opinion of many of their friends
and political advisers, a mystery and
that is . what at the present time is
rocking the political . boat.
In the opinion of a great many of
Mr. Reed's friends that gentleman may
decide to become a candidate for the
Presidential nomination next year, no
matter how futile that attempt may ap
pear this far in advance.
It is argued that as political condi
tions change so rapidly in "this coun
try and the unexpected so frequently
happens, Mr. Reed's candidacy may as
sume greater proportions than political
prophets at the present time are will
ing to concede. That the man from
Maine stands not the least possible

signs point now, is acknowledged even
by. his most enthusiastic admirers, but

Search for a Kidnaped
Child Ends.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PAINESVILLE, Ohio, March 21.â
A sequel to the abduction of Gerald
Lapiner, the three-year-old "son of Mr.
and Mrs. Louis Lapiner, which oc
curred in Chicago on May 30, IS9B, de
veloped here to-day in the recovery
and restoration of the child to his
mother and the arrest of Mrs. Ann
Ingersoll and John Collins, who live
about a mile west of Painesville, ot
whose place the child was found and
where he had been kept since last June.
On the 30th of May Gerald Lapiner
was abducted by a woman from in
front of his parents' home, 8435 Prairie
avenue, in -Chicago. A large reward
was offered for the recovery of the
child, and although the Chicago police
made every effort to bring the kidnap
ers to justice, nothing further could be
learned.
About two months ago a newspaper
account of the abduction and the re
ward offered came under the notice of
F. F. Ferris and his sister. Miss Annie
Ferris, neighbors of the Ingersolls. Mr.
and Miss Ferris suspected that the lit
tle boy who had been at the residence
of Mrs. Ingersoll since last June might
be the missing child, and they entered
into correspondence with the Chicago
police. After about two months' inves
tigation and correspondence it was de
termined that the child was the miss
ing Gerald Lapiner.
Mrs. Lapiner was notified, and she
arrived here this morning jto identify
the little one. She was met at the
station by Deputy Sheriff A. F. May.
who had been in charge of the case
here, and was taken in a closed car
riage to the Ingersoll place, while Sher
iff St. John went on ahead, to prevent
the escape of the abductors. Access to
the house was gained through the rear
door, and there, tied in a high chair,
half dressed, the boy was found. Both
Mrs. Ingersoll and Collins were placed
under arrest and were held for trial
later in the day. Mrs. Ingersoll denies
the charge of abduction, and could not
be induced to say anything about the
case. The hearing of the prisoners was
continued to Thursday. They .will
probably be removed to Chicago as

MRS. TENANT
GETS A DIVORCE
Granted on the Ground
of Cruelty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March Mrs. Mary
Tennant was granted a divorce from
Fred W. Tennant to-day by Judge Hy
land. The ground was extreme cruelty.
The Tennants were until lately very
prominent in society affairs. Mrs. Ten
nant was formerly Miss January,
daughter of Tax Collector W. A. Janu
ary. They were married twenty years
ago and have a family of four children.
The eldest, Miss Marguerite Tennant,
is married to Otto Ziegler, the bicyclist.
Shortly after his marriage Fred W.
Tennant was given property worth
$150,000 by. an aunt. This is alleged to
have turned his head and he com
menced leading a fast life, and of
which to-day's divorce was the culmi
nation. Wine and women figured in his
pastime, and on more than one occasion
he and his wife have been on the verge
of a separation. About ten years ago
he became enamored of a prominent
society young lady of this city and his
wife threatened to leave him. The dif
ference was patched up.
Three years ago Tennant made a
flying trip to South Africa, Since his
return he has been wilder than ever,
and has spent but little time at home.
It is alleged that he frequently beat
Mrs. Tennant and on the last occasion
knocked her down and injured her so
badly that she has been compelled to
use crutches. One evening, it was
charged, he drove up to his home with
Miss Kittle Welch and insisted on
bringing her in and installing her as
mistress of the place. Miss Marguerite,
his daughter, objected to this and
horsewhipped Miss Welch.
About this time Cyclist Ziegler was
drawn into the affair. He took Mrs.
Tennant's part. Tennant ordered him
to keep away from the house. This the
bicyclist refused to do, and several
times he and his now father-in-law
came near, indulging in fisticuffs.
Tennant's fortune has nearly all been
squandered, and what little remains is
heavily mortgaged. It is said he
agreed to divide evenly with his wife,
and she in turn will rear and educate
the minor children.

SAN MATEO COUNTY
INGLESIDE COURSING CLUB IS
LOOKING FOR GROUNDS.
The officers' of the Ingleside Coursing J
Club do not propose to violate the law rel
ative to pool-selling on dog races at Ingle
side Park. On Sunday last a meeting was
held at Ingleside which doubtless will be
the final so fax as the old park is con
cerned.
But the Trojans of the old sport of
coursing will not remain \ idle and turn
a cold shoulder upon a favorits pastime
because the law will not sanction pool
selling on dog racing in this city and
county. The president of the Ingleside
Coursing Club, D. Shannon, is a very
energetic and progressive business man,
who Is now figuring upon a new site for
a coursing park in San Mateo County on
the line of the San Francisco and San
Mateo Electric Railroad Company.
Mr. Shannon has been approached by
business men who are anxious to be
come stockholders in a company to be
organized for coursing purposes and he
is of the opinion that when a favorable
location for a coursing park is discov
ered the necessary money will be forth
coming for the construction of a grand
stand and whatever improvements may
be deemed requisite.
The land which has been used by the
club for coursing at Ingleside is the
property of the Spring Valley Water
Company, which has the right, accord
ing to the terms specified in the lease,
of shutting off coursing on a very short
notice. The club was consequently un
easy at all times that the water company
might need the grounds for special pur- |
poses, and anticipating that at any time
an order to vacate the premises might |
be given, it was slow in advancing sug- i
gested improvements. In fact, there are
among the leaders of the club prominent
i sportsmen who favor a new coursing
j park, provided a lease can be drawn" up
in such a manner that the ones who are
most deeply interested in its future can
feel secure.
It Is not at all improbable that a lease
of Pat Cana van's old park near Ocean
View may be obtained from the owners
for a term of years. If the Ingleside Club
shall be succesful in leasing the land
for the purposes intended, it will not be
very many weeks before coursing will
again be in full blast. Mr. Shannon said
yesterday that all that will be necessary
!in the way of improvements to start the
"game is the fencing of the grounds and
I the erection of a temporary grand stand.
There Is some talk of holding Sunday

such time as the Ingleside Club can move

GOOD CROPS IN
SALINAS VALLEY
Two Days of Continuous
Precipitation.
IRRIGATION DITCHES FILLING
WATER ENOUGH TO LAST ALL
SUMMER.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KINGS CITY, March -1.-Rain has
been falling here at intervals during
the past two days and a southeast wind
has been blowing, which presages the
coming of more rain. The Salinas Val
ley is fast assuming an emerald hue.
and further signs of spring are coming
into evidence every day. The residents
of this section are .greatly elated over
the prospects. Stock on the ranges is
improving greatly, and by the end of
the month will doubtless be in a normal
condition. The success of the season
now depends upon the April showers
and should the usual amount of water
-fall during that month abound crops
will be assured. The irrigation ditches
are fast filling up and the prospects of
sufficient water for the summer crops
are becoming more and more bright.
WALNUT CREEK, March 21â
rainfall since Tuesday last amounts to
4.50 inches and the prospects are got/d
for a further precipitation. ' From tele
phone reports received here from the
various parts of Contra Costa County
it would seem that crops in this county
have never, looked so promising at this
season of the year. An exceedingly
large yield of all kinds of farm and
ranch products is looked for. Fruit
especially looks well and George Reed,
superintendent of the Bancroft ranch,
the largest producer in the valley, says
that on account of the cleaned-up con
dition of the dried fruit market on the
Pacific Coast and owing to the blighted
crops in the East, California fruit
growers will have little to complain of
this season. Commission merchants
are already offering good prices for
fruits on the trees, and a Hamburg.
Germany, firm is offering very good
prices for a shipment of prunes for the
German market.
SAN JOSE, March 21.â Showers have
been falling here since 10 o'clock to-
day. ,
ORANGE, March 21.â Last night
there was a precipitation of .87 of an
inch. The total for the storm was 1.43
inches; for the season 5.58 inches,
against 5.49 inches for last season. The
crop prospects are improving.
SACRAMENTO. March Rain has
been falling slightly here to-night. 1 p
to 11 o'clock it had not amounted to much,
but the outlook is quite threatening. The
weather has been the finest possible for
growing crops, soft and moist.
STOCKTON. March 21â Rain began

It is still raining, and Indications point to
a continuance. '

[ML FOR WEAK WOMEN.GOLD DEMOCRATS
ARE AROUSED
Bryan's Letter Does the j
Trick.
NOT WANTED IN THE FOLD
THEY MUST SEEK AN ABIDING
PLACE.
Generally Believed That the National
Democracy Will Enter the Field
Actively in Nineteen
Hundred.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
Call Heaquarters. Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 21.
It is very generally believed that the
effect of the correspondence between
Bryant and Belmont will be to make
permanent the separation of the lead
ers of the Palmer and Buckner Dem
ocracy from the Democratic party of
â which Bryan is the most conspicuous
figure. All the bitter feeling that exist
ed between these two elements during
the campaign of ISP6 will be revived
by Bryan's latest communication to
Belmont and the iatter's reply. If it
was the intention of Belmont, Whitney.
Governor Flower and a great number
of men of that class, formerly high In
the council of the old Democratic
party, who bolted the Chicago conven
tion and formed a new party, to go
back into the Democratic ranks and
support the regular candidate in 1900.
It is not regarded as at all probable
they will do so after this warning
from Bryan of the sort of reception
they might expect.
There is some difference of opinion
among Chicago platform Democrats as
to the wisdom of Bryan's course, but
most of them applaud it while agree
ing" that it is not calculated to make
friends for the party among gold Dem
ocrats. It is pretty generally agreed
that while many of the rank and file of
the gold Democrats will probably sup
port the candidates of the Democratic
party in 1900, the leading men of that
element who have money and could
afford to materially assist the party
will abandon any idea they may have
entertained of going back.
Until the development of this episode
it was well understood that the new
party organized by the bolters in 1896.
under the name of the National Dem
ocratic party, would not hold a nomi
nating convention in 1900. but would
without ostentation go out of existence.
Now the question arises whether this
purpose to quietly disband will be ad
hered to. It is believed that most of
the sincere gold men of that party
â will Join directly with the Republicans,
but some will be embarrassed by their
anti-exnansion and free trade ideas
and will have to seek asylum else
where. These hoped to be able to so
Influence the regular Democratic par
ty as to convert it into a fairly com
fortable abiding place for themselves,
but this hope is destroyed by the feel
ing disclosed in Bryan's letter.
It is, therefore, suggested that Bel
mont. Whitney and a number of oth
ers of great influence and wealth, will
-gin at once to restore the "National
Democratic party" to activity and to
make preparations to hold a national
convention in 1900 such as was held at
Indianapolis in 1896, and to put a tick
et in the field.

HOW THE OIL TRUST
THROTTLES RIVALS
NEW YORK, March 21.â hear
ing in the case of the State of
Ohio ex rel. F. S. Monnett. At
torney General, against the
Buckeye Pipe Line Company of
Lima, was resumed to-day in the of
fice of Charles Edgar Mills, sitting as
special commissioner. Attorney Gen
eral Monnett conducted his side of the
case. Messrs. Elliott and Kline ap
peared for the company. It was ex
pected that the State of Ohio would
present representatives of three or four
important oil refineries of Ohio to testi
fy to alleged arbitrary methods of the
pipe line. Before the case opened. At
torney Monnett announced that he had
been unable to get these witnesses, and
after a brief re-examination of George
R. Rice he would close his case for
the time being. Mr. Monnett explained
that he was informed that the courts
could compel the attendance of the wit
nesses, but they did not punish them
if they refused to testify.
The proceedings against the pipe line
company are to secure an annulment
of its charter on the ground that the
company has violated the anti-trust
laws of Ohio and that in defiance of
the courts, it is still a member of the
Standard Oil trust.
The purpose of calling Mr. Rice to
day was to allow him to testify in con
tradiction to the statement made by
John D. Archbold that he had attempt
ed to blackmail the Standard Oil Com
pany by demanding $500,000 for his
properties, which were worth about
$25,000. Mr. Rice, replying to the Attor
ney General's invitation that he make
a statement, read from a lengthy man
uscript.
"It is true," he said, "that in ISS6 on
their solicitation I did submit a propo
sition to sell all of my oil properties â j
not only my refinery, but production as
well for the sum stated."
Mr. Rice quoted from the letters of
Mr. Archbold, already published, to
show that the Standard Oil Company
had his proposition under consideration.
The Standard Oil Company, Mr. Rice
said, by its control of the railroads has
raised the freights so that it was im
possible for him to carry on his busi
ness.
"In 1886," he said, "the Baltimore and
Ohio Southern connections raised the
freight rates on me from 50 to 162 per
cent, and none on the Standard Oil
trust, which closed up fourteen of my
agencies out of twenty-four in five
months and shut me out of over half
the towns in which I was doing busi
ness."
Replying to a question by Mr.
Elliott, Mr. Rice gave the date of the
occurrences of which he was complain
ing as early in 1881 and 1882. He ad
mitted that the Buckeye Pipe Line
Company was not organized until 1885.
In concluding his statement Mr. Rice
said he could prove that the Standard
Oil Company had secretly and crimin
ally blackmailed the railroads of this
city of millions of dollars on rebate of
freight.

SLOAN SECOND IN
THE LINCOLNSHIRE
LONDON. March 21.â At the Lincoln
spring meeting, of which this was the sec
ond day's racing, the Sudbrooke plate was
won by Lady Planet. Swirl, with Tod
Sloan in the saddle, was unplaced. There
were nineteen horses in this event, and
the betting was 5 to 1 against Swirl.
The Lincolnshire handicap Was won by
! General Peace, owned by Captain Be
wicke. Lord William Beret-ford's six
; year-old Knight of the Thistle, carrying
116 pounds, with Tod Sloan up. was sec
ond, and H. V. Long's three-year-old colt
Lord Edward II was third. Twenty-six
! horses ran.
There was a tiresome delay at the post
; and a number of breakaways. G. M. In
j glo's Court Ball, aged, overpowered his
! jockey and ran the entire course. A good
start was finally effected, and M. River 'â 
I Little Eva showed to the front, followed
!by Lord Beresford's Knight of the
i Thistle, General Peace and Cllpstone.
I After the quarter post had been passed
j Cllpstone was in trouble, and at the half
! way mark Little Eva gave place to Gen
eral Peace. Below the distance Knight of
the Thistle challenged the leader, but
never looked like getting on even terms,
and General Peace won in a canter.
Sloan may be said to have been mobbed
by his admirers on making his first ap
pearance here this season with the racing
colors in the race for the Sudbrooke plate,
and there was a rush to put money on
Swirl, simply because the American
: Jockey was "riding that horse. Sloan
showed all his old resource in getting first
away and he made a bold bid for victory
at the finish, but Swirl was not good
enough and was unplaced.
General Peace, the winner of the handi
cap is a brown colt by Gallinule out of
Moi'ra. five years old. and carried 101
nound's. The conditions of the race were
as follows: The Lincolnshire handicap
of 1000 sovereigns, added to a sweepstakes
of 15 sovereigns each, 10 forfeit, for three
vear-olds and upward, the winner of any
handicap after the weights are published
(January 26. at noon) to carry five pounds,
of two. or one of the value of 200 sover
eigns seven pounds extra; the second to
receive 100 sovereigns and the third 50

JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, THE STANDARD OIL MAGNATE.
When he had finished, counsel for the
pipe line company asked him if the
prepared statement he had read from
did not contain the same testimony he
had given in Columbus. .Mr. Rice said
that in substance it was the same. He
said he was testifying in the present
proceedings because he wanted an op
portunity for contradiction of the
"false and malicious statements made
by John D. Archbold."
"Is Â«*!t not a fact," asked Mr. Kline,
"that in 1890 you sent to the Standard
Oil Company through Mr. Orvis an of
fer to accept $500,000 for all your oil
properties, agreeing if the offer was
accepted to abate litigation?"
"Yes, I guess I did."
Mr. Rice's testimony to the same ef
fect, given at the hearing in Columbus,
was read to him and he said it was
correct.
Replying to Mr. Kline, Mr. Rice said
that in 1879 he offered to sell his re
finery to ex-Senator Campbell for $20,

The Second Assistant Postmaster
General said to-day:
"I have read in the Associated Press
I dispatches the San Francisco Call's
complaint that Alaskan mails have
been congested at Skaguay by reason
of the neglect of the Canadian officials.
This is hard to understand in view of
the fact that we have an agent there
who reports to us at regular intervals.
We heard from him about two weeks
ago and he said nothing about such
stagnation or failure of the Canadians
to transport mail not bearing Canadian
stamps. It will be readily understood
that during certain months it is next
to impossible to make the regular trips.
This was true of December and Janu
ary and probably accounts for this re
port, for there were about 4000 pounds
of mall there at that time awaiting
transportation. >">;â¢ : . . .
"We instructed our agent that in case
of failure of the contractor to deliver
the mail he was to provide temporary
service and deduct the cost from the
compensation of the contractor. His
reports received two weeks ago stated
that mails were being transferred sat
isfactorily, but on May first we will
make a survey preliminary to the es
tablishment of a trail from Valdes up
Copper River as far as possible. A
postoffice inspector from San Francisco
or Seattle will accompany the expedi
tion to see that the contractor fully

objected to producing officers of the

say on that subject. The Attorney

Fight Between San Rafael's Recorder

Bitter.
PAX RAFAEL, March 21.â 8y officiat
ing, at another marriage ceremony City
Recorder Gardner has not only widened
the breach between himself and Justice
George Rodden. but has caused so much
strife among officials generally that it is
probable that the affair will reach the
courts. Few persons care anything
about the matter so far as the disagree
ment between the two principals is con
cerned, but many believe that the codes
do not authorize a Recorder to unite lov
ing hearts, and that consequently such
marriages are illegal.
Albert Boynton. Chase, living at 202
East Ninth street, Oakland, applied to I
Cupid Graham to-day for a license to
wed Beatrice Josephine Perkins of 1115
West street, Oakland. The boy was only
19 years old and the girl 17. but the writ
ten consent of their parents was pre
sented, and a license was accordingly is
sued in due form. The youthful couple
were referred to Justice Rodden, but
failed to find him in his office. Recorder
Gardner's eagle eye was upon them, how
ever, and he came forward with an offer
to tie the nuptial knot. His services were
accepted and the two were made one
provided Gardner is entitled to officiate.
As it stands now. there is merely another
couple who, pending a judicial decision,
do not really know whether they are
united or not. _.'.'â 
When Rodden heard of the marriage he
was furious, and declared that "this thing
might as well end now as at any other
time " He would wait until the munici
pal election was over. in April, and if
Gardner were re-elected would bring the
matter into court. "-
Gardner takes the matter philosophi
cally and says a Supreme Court decision
authorizes him to perform marriage cer
emonies. He announces his intention to
continue in business at the same old
stand until he is legally restrained. As
for Rodden, his opponent declares, he
"may be a learned man, but his ipse

STOCKTON, March Bernard Mc-
Dermott died at the Stockton State
Hospital last night at 11:30 o'clock from
the effects of an assault made on him
Sunday afternoon by another patient,
Thomas Strong.
McDermott and Strong were both In
mates of a ward on the second floor
of the south wing of the men's depart
ment- The ward is in charge of Attend
ants Mcintosh and Mclntyre. Only
Mcintosh was in the ward at the time
of the assault as it was Mclntyre's
afternoon off. While Mcintosh was at
one end of the right angle he could not
see what was occurring in the other
wing. At about 1:45 o'clock he saw
McDermott sitting in a sort of stupor
on a bench near a grated window, as
had been his custom of late. The at
tendant then went to the other end of
the ward. ".
On his return, five minutes later, he
saw Strong standing by McDermott
and the latter had his head drawn back
against a bar. Strong had taken off
his suspenders and had made a slipknot
j and this he had thrown over McDer
j mott's head, drawing it taut and caus
ing strangulation. McDermott lay In a
! stupor from the time of the assault till
j his death last night.
McDermott was admitted on April 6,
1891, from San Francisco, although his
home was in this city. His father,
J Bernard McDermott, lives in this city
and a sister is now in San Francisco.

pron) the Ur)ion v
LONDON, March 22.â The Times publishes this morning a letter from
a correspondent in Bermuda, who describes Rear Admiral Sampson's
visit there last month and gives "an authorized interview" with the ad
miral.
According to the correspondent Admiral Sampson, remarking up on
the "marvelous change in American opinion," said: "Formerly Eng
land was regarded as the only European power with which the United
States was likely to have serious differences. Now we regard England
as our best, perhaps our only friend. I cannot say whether this feeling
will prove permanent, but I hope it may. Possibly we could not hope
for more than England's moral support, in the first instance, in any
conflict with a Continental power; but in times of real difficulty it
would ripen, sooner or later, into a defensive alliance.
"I say frankly that in my opinion the United States has more to
gain from such an alliance than England has. Therefore I rejoice un
felgnedly at the change of sentiment in the United States. I am not less
gratified that no such change is needed in Great Britain, and if any
words of mine can cement a friendship calculated to benefit the whole
world, it is a pleasure to myself and a duty to my country to utter
them."
on Christmas day from Modesto. On
August 3, 1898, he attacked a woman
in that town. Since he has been in the
asylum he has made two other assaults
upon other inmates. About two months
ago he struck a patient with a mop
while he was in the receiving ward.
Two weeks ago he struck another pa
tient with his fists after he had been
transferred to the ward in which Mc-
Dermott was afterward strangled. Since
then Strong has had to wear wristlets
attached to a waist strap.
The fact that he killed McDermott
did not we rry him in the least. He
laughed and thought it an exceedingly
good joke. â *'-' ''â 'â 'â

MRS. WADLEIGH REMOVED.
New Public Librarian Appointed at

LOS ANGELES, March 21.â Mrs. Har
riet Wadleigh was removed to-day. from
the position of librarian of the Los An

managing editor of the Express, was
elected to fill her place. This action was
done in the face of the fact that Mayor
Eaton sent word to the effect that if such
action were taken he would declare the
offices of board members vacant. It wu
carried out as though it had been care
fully planned. The directors say the
plans to remove Mrs. Wadleigh had long
been on foot.
Mrs. Wadleigh filed a long protest
against handing in her resignation, as had
ben demanded yesterday, and refused to
comply with the request of the trustees.
Resolutions were then adopted which de
clared that for good cause and for inabil
ity to maintain proper discipline and for
executive incompetency the office be de
clared vacant. The board voted as a unit
on the dismissal. Mrs. Wadleigh will

Fired UpoQ.
VICTORIA, B. C, March Among the passengers on the steamer
Danube from the north were H. R. Oakes and Y. D. Hered, two Eng
lishmen who have been working a claim on Millar Creek. They bring
a sad complaint from the Indians along the Pelly and the tribes liv
ing between Stewart and the McMillan, and paint a sorrowful picture
of the conditions existing along the big river. The miners, they say,
are suffering from scurvy. But It is not the whites who are the most
to be pitied; the unfortunate tribes of Indians who inhabit the districts
are famine-stricken.
There has been a scarcity of food all winter, and the various min
ing camps have been called upon to feed numbers of the unfortunate In
dians. It Is becoming evident, the two miners say, that these Indians
have "been dying like sheep, and that the race is doomed to extinction.
A strange story has been reported to the soldiers at Fort Selkirk of
how* the Chilkats near there attempted to kill a prospector on the Mac-
Millan River. It Is said one of the medicine men of the Chilkats told
the tribe that not until it secured a white chief would It cease to de
generate. A pow-wow of several of the chiefs was held and it was
decided to endeavor to get one of the prospectors In the vicinity to
accept the position of "hyas tyee" of the once powerful and warlike tribe.
Robert Stanton of Indiana, who has for some three years been pros
pecting the MacMillan country with indifferent success, was offered the
position. Unlike the hero of Kipling's story, however, Stanton was the
man who would not be king and he spurned the proffered chieftaincy.
Angered and hurt, the chiefs left him, and he considered the incident
closed.
About a week afterward, while he was cooking his evening meal,
several bullets whistled over his head, one just grazing his shoulder.
He managed to escape without injury, and thinking it unsafe to remain
In the country, struck out for Selkirk, where he reported his adventure
to the soldiers. He believes the Indians, whose chief he refused to be,
endeavored to shoot him in revenge.

MISSING FOR TEN YEARS
APPEARS BY CHANCE AT A
FRIEND'S HOME.
Learns for the First Time of Her
Parents' Death and the Wealth
That Is Awaiting Her
Return.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GERMANTOWN, March 21.â This is
t story of a German girl who for ten
years has been keeping out of sight of
a fortuneâ hiding while wealth went in
search of her. Wiebge Glinderman,
who calls herself Sophie Glinderman,
left Hohenaspe, Germany, in ISS2. She
arrived in San Francisco and took up |
her abode with her cousin William of
the firm of Glinderman & Sweitzer,
watchmakers and jewelers, on the cor
ner of Third and Market. She soon
went to work, however, and in 1887 re
turned to the land of her nativity with
bout $2500, the fruits of her toil dur
ing the six years of her stay in Call- j
lv.ma.
The next year she returned to the
Golden State, and from that time to j
within the last few days her where- i
abouts remained a mystery. Although j
she knew where her relatives were, ,
they could not find her. Great efforts I
were made through advertising and j
otherwise, but no trace of the missing
woman could be discovered.
About a month ago H. Hinrlchs of
this place, whose wife is sick, sought
the services of a nurse. In answer to
his call for assistance came Wiebge
Glinderman.
Some time ago her parents, who were
still in Germany, died, leaving an es
tate, of which her share amounts to
over $25,000. Besides this, Miss Glin
derman has $2000 in the German Sav
ings Bank of San Francisco and va
rious other sums invested to good ad
vantage. Had she known of her larger
fortune in the old country she proba
bly would not have kept in hiding here.
She knew that Mrs. John Duhr, a
cousin, resided in Germantown, Glenn
County, but the map which she con
sulted must have been out of date, asÂ»
on it Germantown was still marked in
Colusa County. Had it not been for
this mistake on her part there is no
telling when her relatives would have
received intelligence of her where
abouts.
Besides her cousin William and her
cousin, Mrs. Duhr, she has a cousin,
Mrs. Augusta Laubscher, of San Fran
cisco; two other cousins, John Glinder
man, late of San Francisco, but now of
Spokane, Wash., and Mrs. Lizzie
Smidt, a grocer on Taylor street, San
Francisco; and an uncle, Claus Haden
feldt, wholesale jeweler, whose place of
business is on Sutter street in San
Francisco.
Miss Glinderman started for San
Francisco to-day. She told her rela
tives here that she would, upon her
arrival In the city, go immediately to
her cousin William's place of business,
but after her eccentric career of the
past ten years, her relatives fear that
she will again secrete herself from
them.

Tod Bassett, who was recently released
after serving a fifteen-year sentence for
burglary from Plumas County, returned
to-day and threatened the life of Warden
Hale, who, the convict alleges, retained
$5 sent to him while he was imprisoned.
The money was forfeited to the State be
cause an attempt was made to smuggle
It- Into the penitentiary. Bassett became
so violent that several guards had to be
called to eject him from â  the prison
grounds. He declares that if the courts
grant him no redress he will take the
matter into his own hands.. , It Is believed
the ex-convict is insane, and he will not
be permitted on the grounds again for
fear he may -commit murder.

HAINES MISSION, Alaska, | March
10. â Somebody here, said to be a man
named Campbell, who has now gone up
the Porcupine trail, has given out that
he has received a letter from Washing
ton, D. C, stating that the land grant
of 640 acres supposed to have been
made by Congress for the benefit of the
Presbyterian Indian mission here was
never made at all. About two weeks
ago part of the mission's square mile of
land was "jumped," much to the con
sternation of Rev. Mr. Warren, the
missionary in charge. Since the report
of the receipt of the Campbell letter the
mission land has been "jumped" right
and left, while the little missionary
herd looked on with clasped hands in
mute protest.
The mission grant composes the most
level and sightly location on the pe
ninsula between Chilkat and Chilkoot
inlets, and in the event that Haines
Mission continues to grow at the pres
ent rate it will be a most valuable
property before many months.
Haines Mission is a booming frontier
town with tents, barbed wire fences
and new shacks, and a few more pre
tentious buildings. Several large ships
from the Sound put in here, and the
regular steamers from Juneau and
Skaguay are well filled with passen
gers and freight. There la a large
amount of travel for the season. Par
ties take to the trail for the Porcupine
country every day, and the country Is
steadily filling with gold-seekers.
Which will be the best camp up the
trail can hardly be determined before
the snow goes off. New and rich
strikes were reported to-day by par
ties coming, in from Herman and
Glacier creeks, but as yet there has
been no opportunity to corroborate the
report. A fierce storm of wind and
snow has been raging for nearly a
week, making travel dangerous and
uncertain on sea and shore.
Haines Mission, with Its tents and
new board houses and saloons, looks
about like Skaguay did at Its beginning,
over a year ago.

The general committee of the Pacific
Ocean and International Exposition met
at 3:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce.
There was a large attendance of the mem
bers of the committee, and the meeting
was presided over by Temporary Presi
dent J. B. Reinsteln.
Mr. Patton, as the chairman of the
legislative committee, reported that , tha
committee had gone to Sacramento and
successfully secured the passage of the
bill appropriating $250,000 toward defray
ing in part the expense of the exposition.
One-half of this amount is payable in
January, 1800, and the remainder a year
later. Mr. Patton further stated that the
bill had been properly brought before the
Governor, and that the reports to the
contrary were a mistake. The committee
voted a letter of thanks to Assemblymen
Cobb and Rlckard, Senator Wolfe and
others, for their assistance in securing
the passage of the bill.
Mr. Patton then read the following
communication:
OAKLAND, March 21, 1593.

Dear Sirâ following resolutions
were passed at the meeting of the Board
of Trade to-day:
"Whereas, There is now pending be

"Whereas, The Increase of taxation
rendered necessary by the arproprlatlon
will fall most heavily on the wealthy
residents and taxpayers of San Fran
cisco and Oakland, places deriving the
greatest benefit from the proposed In

"Whereas, The present ls an oppor

"Resolved, That these resolutions be

forwarded to Governor Gage and given
to the daily papers for publication."
â¢E. A. HERO***. President.
CRAIGIE SHARP, Secretary.
Mr Patton suggested that simllaractlon
should be secured from the various cham
bers of commerce all over the State, as
he was aware that Governor Gage is de
sirous of Immediately obtaining the senti
ments of all the cities and* towns In the
State relative to the holding of the expo
sition. The committee then discussed in
detail plans for securing similar expres
sions from the various chambers of com
merce of the State and having them im
mediately wired to Governor Gage.
Mayor Pheian said he had had an in
terview with the Governor and he be
lieved him to be favorably disposed to
ward the exposition. I
On a motion of Senator Wolfe the com
mittee decided to at once communicate
with the Republican and Democratlo
State central committees and secure their
Indorsement and have it at once forward
ed to the Governor. :>..: .
On motion Mayor Pheian, Mr. Patton,
Senator Wolfe, J. A. Filcher and ex-Sena
tor Tracey were appointed a committee to
obtain expressions from the various
boards of trade and political organiza
tions throughout the State and to ac
quaint Governor Gage with the same.
The committee was given the power to
act. President Relnsteln suggested the
feasibility of Immediately communicating
with the Governor and requesting him to
allow the committee some little time in
which to secure the various expressions
from over the State. The suggestion was
well received and Mayor Pheian was In
structed to communicate with the Gover
nor at once on the matter.
LIETTTENANT NEALL 'S CASE.
The Cavalry Officer May Escape Even
a Court-Martial. â 
The statue of the case of Lieutenant
Neall remains the same. No charges
against the officer were sent to depart
ment headquarters yesterday by Colonel
Compton. If charges are going to be pre
ferred against Lieutenant Neall they must
of a necessity first be submitted to General
Shafter, as he has to appoint tne mem
bers of the court-martial. He also has
the power to approve or disapprove any
sentence of the court which is not dis
missal from the service. Should the court
fix the officer's punishment at dismissal,
then it can only be set aside by the Presi
dent. There was a current belief around
headquarters yesterday that Lieutenant
Neall will be let off with simply a repri
mand from Colonel Compton. Lven should
the latter officer prefer charges. It is
thought that absence without leave will
be the only charge preferred. Should a
court be deemed necessary to dispose of
the case, it will be composed of officers
who are the superiors of Lieutenant Neall.
although this is not compuisory How
ever, It is the custom, as a court is sup
posed to be composed of officers who
would not be benefited by the dismissal
of the officer tried. An officer on trial has
the right to object to any member of the
court who might be benefited by his dis
missal. _ , â 
â  There Is a strong influence at work in
behalf of Lieutenant Neall. A prominent
officer at headquarters said yesterday:
"The fact that \ieall came back under the
circumstances â¢Â«- certainly greatly in his
favor. I do not know of a case where any
officer ever returned under similar cir
cumstances.". Still another office- of the
department, who is of high rank, said:
"Lieutenant Neall I deserves leniency, for
the service can ill afford to lose such an
officer." _..â*.
The advent of a portion of the Twenty
fourth Infantry to the Presidio and the
other posts of this harbor for garrison
duty has been delayed by the fact that
smallpox has broken out in "Utah near the
post at which they are now stationed. The
Ninth Infantry, which will -be in camp
here for several days .while awaiting
transportation to the Philippines, is ex
pected to arrive here to-morrow. A por
tion of the Sixth Artillery, which has been
ordered to Manila, is expected to leave the
East in the near future for this city en
route to the Philippines.

GOOD INSURANCE LAW
FOR DELINQUENTS
SUPREME COURT AGAINST SNAP
JUDGMENT.
An Agent Can Extend Time on Pay
ments of Premiums Com
pany Bound by His Act.
A decision of no small Importance was.
was rendered by the Supreme Court yes
terday. Mrs. Alice L. Knarston, a widow,
brought an action against the Manhattan :
Life Insurance Company of New. York to
recover upon a policy of life insurance
taken out by her husband, deceased. The
defense was that the policy had become
forfeited prior to the death of the insured
by reason of the non-payment of the
fourth semi-annual payment. The pre
mium became' due on November 15, 1895,
but when the company's collector called
Knarston was away from his place of
business. The collector called again on
the following day, with like results, and
a Mr. Gilmore. representing the insured,
called upon General Manager Landers of
the company and asked for an extension
of time to November 24, which was grant
ed. On the 25th and 27th the collector
called again, but was unable to find
Knarston, and on December 2 the latter
was killed in a railroad accident.
In the lower court the insurance com
pany was successful. The Supreme Court
took a different view of the matter, re
versed the judgment of the lower court
and ordered a new trial. The court states
that two important questions are in
volved. The flrst is, "May a general agent
of an insurance company waive the con
ditions of a policy and extend the time
of payment of a premium?" The court
holds with other authorities that he may
waive conditions either in writing or ver
bally, and the employer is bound by the
act of the agent, unless special restric
tions are placed upon the latter.
The widow contended that the company
waived the payment of the premium at
the time it became due under the policy,
and hence there was no forfeiture of the
policy at tho time of Knarston's death.
The Supreme Court considers that this
contention has full support ln the law,
and adds: "The law does not like for
feitures and evidence tending to show the
waiver of a forfeiture will be looked upon
with kindly eyes."
The acknowledgment of the . general
manager that he would have accepted
payment up to the time of the death of
Insured had much to do with the reversal
of the judgment.

tute was held last evening. Rodney Ken
drick, vice president, presided in the ab
sence of President Denlcke.
The book committee recommended that
books to the amount of $387 be purchased,
and the librarian reported seventeen new
members since March 1.
The subject of the Mechanics' Fair, to
be opened on September 2, was debated at
length. It has been the purpose of the di
rectors to make it to some extent a colo
nial exposition and gather exhibits from
the Philippine Islands. In pursuance of
this proposition letters have been written,
which will be submitted to-day to Major
General Shafter for Indorsement, asking
of the Government that the exhibits be
transported free of cost on home-coming
Government vessels.
Horace Wilson offered a resolution to In
clude prize exhibits from the several
counties of the State. He supported his
proposal by stating that the fair held in
1887, which was the most successful ever
fiven by the Institute, was contributed to
rom all portions of the State. He said
that by September the interest In the Pa
cific islands might be waning, and that
something of an attractive nature should
be arranged on which to base the adver
tisements of the fair. His resolution was
adopted and referred to the management
committee.

CARPENTERS
WILL ENFORCE
A WAGE SCALE
Significance of the
Mass- Meetings.
NO STRIKES ARE EXPECTED
THE IST OF MAY THE DAY SET
FOB ENFORCEMENT.
Unions Have Been Steadily Increas
ing Their Membership and
- Now Expect to Win Out
in One Grand Coup.
"Brothers', now is the time to unite."
This was the sense of the mass-meeting
of carpenters and joiners in Scottish Hall
last night.
The carpenters have for the past month
been using strenuous efforts to augment
the membership of the local unions. All
unions in this city have procured special
dispensations which enable them to take
ln members at the reduced fee of $1 until
the Ist of May. Right on the head of this
a series of mass-meetings have been held,
the result of which has been large acces
sions to the ranks of organized labor.
The Carpenters' District Council has re
cently decided that after the Ist of May
the scale of $3 for an eight-hour day will
be rigidly enforced. Right on the head
of this resolution came the dispensations
permitting local unions to take in mem
bers at a reduced rate until May 1, and
the series of mass-meetings.
P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build
ing Trades Council and a prominent car
penter, when interviewed on the subject,
said: "It is true that we intend enforc
ing our scale after the first day of May.
The scale is an old one, but we thought
it wise ln certain instances to close our
eyes to violations of it. These mass-meet
ings have no particular connection with
it. We are simply endeavoring to organ
ize all members of the craft. We expect
no strikes."
The meeting last night was a success
from start to finish. E. L. Malsbary, dis
trict organizer, acted as chairman, and
introduced the sneakers and entertainers.
Ed Rosenberg, W. J. Macarthur, M. Mon
ahon and M. C. Dunne sat on the platform
as representatives of the Labor Council.
The meeting opened with a short address
by Mr. Malsbary, followed by the enter
tainment, which was as follows: Piano
solo, William Bare: vocal solo, Miss Os
soski, accompanied by Miss Reynolds;
recitation. Master George Atkinson; vocal
solo, J. Swanson; vocal solo, William Mur
ray, accompanied by J. Douglass.
Speeches on trades unionism were then
made by P. 11. McCarthy. M. H. Hutch
inson, Charles Jeffers, E. L. Malsbary and
H. M. Saunders. After the speech-making
the evening was given up to dancing.

Morning and evening services wen- at
tended by Immense congregations, which
received with close attention clear and im
pressive expositions of Catholic doctrine
and practices, as well as a vigorous de
nunciation of the "vulgar passions."
Statistics lately collected in various lo
calities in Bavaria and Sweden prove a
definite relation Between the hardness of

little of the alkaline earth salts, and the

SITUATION IS
MUCH IMPROVED
San Luis Houses to
Resume Business.
INSOLVENCY FOR ONE ONLY
NORMAL CONDITIONS WILL .
SOON RETURN.
To the Recent Bountiful Rains
Throughout the County Is Due
the Radical Change for
the Better.
As anticipated in yesterday's Call, the
Bank Commissioners have granted the
request of the Commercial Bank of San
Luis Obispo and the Citizens' Bank of
Paso Robles to resume business. At the
meeting of -the Commissioners the situa
tion of the financial institutions of the
southern part of the State was generally
discussed and the condition of affairs was
found to be much brighter than it was a
week ago. Of course the recent fall of
rain upon the dry fields has had much to
do with the improvement of the situation.
This is shown by the following letter re
ceived relative to the opening of the two
banks mentioned:
' SAN* FRANCISCO, March 20, 1899.
To the Honorable Board ot Bank Conimls-
Eloners; Gentlemenâ Acting under instruc
tions of the Board of Directors of the Com
mercial Bank of San Luis Obispo, I beg to
petition your honorable board to permit the
..aid Commercial Bank to resume business on
or after March 27, 1599. In justification of the
request I respectfully submit:
Firstâ That under the excitement of the mo
ment I let a large portion of the assets be
written off by your esteemed e*i*.miner, which
asseu are absolutely good, and 1 overlooked
some of our grood collaterals and securities en
tirely, as explained verbally to your Honor
able Board. , , _ , ._ .. - t
Secondâ Alter careful revision I claim that
our capital is not impaired to the extent of
over $50 000. and that with a favorable season
this shrinkage will be mostly wiped out.
Thirdâ Our shareholders will put into the
bank a sum of "30,000 cash, which has been
offered to us and which will not be paid back
and no dividend will be declared until - our
Honorable Body ls fully satisfied that the cap
ital is not impaired any longer.
Fourthâ Before opening we will get an ex
tension from our larger depositors so as to
be absolutely certain that the ready means
placed at our disposition are ample for all
eventualities. With the present outlook of
the season a very bright future awaits our
lank and we trust you will kindly grant our
request and assist us to thus overcome our
difficulties in which we were plunged through
the closing of the .County Bank .Â«0 .cry re
eiectfullv McD. K. ENABLE,
epe^t.unj, President.
The permission was gladly granted, the
understanding being .that the larger de
positors are not to withdraw their money
lor six. twelve and eighteen months, ac
cording to the amounts. At the present
time there is due to the depositors $29..
--449 91 and to bankers $66,033 51. .
A similar request was made by the of
ficers of the Citizens' Bank of Paso Bo
bles, which was granted, as the depositors
had made promises the same as those of
the larger bank. Its shareholders will put
$15 000 in cash into the treasury at once.
Attn bank there is now due depositors
$43 676 70 nd to bankers $38-902 66. The
Commissioners are satisfied that ere long
both institutions will be on their feet.
Of the County Bank, the first to close
its doors, which caused the suspension of
the others, there is a different story to
tell. It-** affairs are In such a condition f
that he Commissioners are satisfied that
the best interests of all concerned will be
subserved if the institution goes into in
eolvencv. Hence it was decided to report
to the Attorney General the recommenda
tion that he take -steps to throw the bank
Into Insolvency. From all accounts there
is due to the "depositors $284.344 33 and to
bankers $149 893 54. The assets have been
Fcaled down to about $517,000. In the same
list is the little bank at Templeton, which
went down when the larger banks fell. Its
officers have notified the Commissioners
that they desire to go out of business, but
ln doing" so thav will retire in good shape
and no one win lose by the dissolution of
the concern. Permission has been grant
ed to do so. ' )
MISSIONITES WANT
VALENCIA STREET PAVED
BELIEVE IT IS THE CITY'S
NATURAL OUTLET.
Supervisors Will Not Permit Market
Street Company to Build on
Geary Street.
The merchants doing business. on or
near Valencia street are making a deter
mined effort to have that thoroughfare
paved with bitumen and ultimately to
have its name changed to Market street.
A meeting of the Mission Business Men's
Association has been held and every pos
sible effort will be made to carry out the
projected improvements. A petition
signed by thousands of persons residing
fn the Mission will be presented .to Chair
man Aigeitinger and his associates on
the Street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors at their meeting to-morrow. The
Missionites believe Valencia street is the
natural outlet of the city and should be
in keeping with the necessities of travel
over it. , _"'','_ _
An informal meeting was held yesterday
in the office of the Merchants' Association,
including Supervisor Aigeitinger, chair
man and Supervisor Holland, member of
the Street Committee, and Supervisor Per
rault chairman of the Finance Committee
of the Board of Supervisors, with the
committee on public affairs of the Mer
cants* Association. The main subject of
discussion was the route for the proposed
electric street railways, for which peti
tions are pending before the Board of Su
pervisors. >"
The conclusion of this conference was
that the Supervisors who were present
will recommend to the board the granting
of the franchises, except over that por
tion of Gearv street from Taylor street to
Grant avenue and along Grant avenue
from Geary street to Post. This will not
only do away with the proposed "death's
curve" at Kearny and Geary streets* but
it will also preclude the possibility of
the Market Street Railway Company se
curing a vested right to any portion of
Geary street.

CRUISER CHITOSE OFF FOR JAPAN
THE magnificent warship built by the Union Iron Works for the Japanese Government started home
ward yesterday afternoon. She was accompanied down the bay by a number of tugs and every
steamer in the bay whistled a farewell and every ship dipped her flag as the cruiser teamed by. The
Chitose will call at Honolulu on her way to Japan.
THE CHITOSE

SHE WILL CALL AT HONOLULU
<

Steamer Caroline Breaks Her Shaft.
Zealandia Will Sail for Manila
Next â Drumlan
rig's Damages.
The cruiser Chitose, built by the Union
Iron Works for the Japanese Government,
sailed for Yokohama via Honolulu yester
day. The warship was given a splendid
sendoff as she steamed down the hay.
Tugs and -steamers whistled her a fare
well, the* battleship lowa saluted as she
passed, while the river steamer Alviso and
the tugs Millen Griffith, Liberty, Union
and Milton accompanied her as far as
Lime Point.
The Alviso was chartered by the Japa
nese of the city, as was also the Liberty
and Milton. On the Alviso there .was a
brass band and a great store of bombs
and firecrackers. The former were sent
off at intervals of a minute, while the
firecrackers and the band were going all
the time. On the Millen Griffith were
the officials of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, while on the Union were Irv
ing M. Scott, Henry T. Scott. George
Dickey and Robert Forsyth of the Union
Iron Works and Naval Constructor Sa
kurai of the Japanese navy. All the
steamers were decked with bunting, but
the Chitose flew the Japanese flag from
her peak and her homeward bound pen
nant alone. The fleet made, a very pretty
picture as it moved slowly seaward.
. From here the Chitose goes to Honolulu,
and after a short stay there will proceed
to Yokohama and thence to the Japanese
navy yard, where she will receive her
armament. The cruiser will not be speed
ed across the Pacific, so no record-break
ing runs may be expected. Ope of the
Union Iron Works' engineers went out on
the warship and will remain by her for a
year. _
Captain Leale of the steamer Caroline
did not know whether to be angry or glad
when he received word of his appointment
as Pilot Commissioner. A letter contain
ing the good news was handed the gallant
captain as his vessel was getting ready to
start for Baden. Putting the missive in
his pocket, Leale remarked that he would
read it when he got out in the bay. V hen*
the Caroline was headed for her destina
tion the letter was brought forth, and just
as the* captain had mastered its contents
the steamer broke her shaft. That means
laving her up a month for repairs, and
that, Is why Captain Leale did not know
whether to be glad or swear when he
read of his appointment. While the Caro
line is laid up the Queen of the Yukon
is running in her stead.
The repairs to the transport Zealandia
will be completed to-morrow and the ves
sel will probably get away for Manila next
Wednesday. She will take a quantity of
supplies and about 900 soldiers.
The British ship Drumlanrig. now at
Montevideo, is worse damaged than was
at first supposed. She was on her way
from Liverpool to Puget Sound and was
caught in a hurricane. Some of her spars
were carried away and the cargo shifted.
A cable received by the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday states that the repairs
will cost $12,500. Â« f- --â¢:.-..,
The steamer Colon arrived from Central
American ports last night. She came up
in 19 days 10 hours, and brought twenty
three cabin, seven steerage and three Chi
nese passengers. â¢

THE SAN. FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 1899.
M'COY READY FOR
HIS BOUT WITH JOE
He Begins to Ease Off in
His Preparatory Work.
{.TTT ID" McCoy is in superb condition for his twenty-round contest with Joe Choynski, which takes place at the
]/(' Mechanics' Pavilion next Friday night. Representatives of both men will meet at the Palace Hotel at 8 o'clock
T\ this evening to select the referee.
-***â  -*- McCoy began tapering off his preparatory work yesterday. The roads about his training quarters at the
Casino were damp and muddy, and the "Kid" cut out his usual ten-mile sprint. After dinner McCoy, his trainer.
Jack Stelzner, and several friends, went out on the lawn and spent half an hour shooting at coins with small parlor
rifles. McCoy proved quite as handy at this pastime as he is with the mittens. He hit several dimes square in the
center and sent the fragments of two or three half-dollar pieces flying skyward. It was a deviation that cost money, but
the "Kid" enjoyed it, and his generous friends quickly replaced a coin in the notched post every time the "Kid" made a
true shot.
Later in the afternoon McCoy stripped and sallied Into the improvised gymnasium at the Casino to commence the
rounding off process. He was first photographed in every position conceivable by newspaper men.
McCoy's indoor work is simply marvelous. He is a wonderfully clever bag-puncher, and when- he goes at the
leathern sphere he makes it do everything but sing. After tossing the bag about his head, neck and shoulders for five
or ten minutes the "Kid" put the gloves on and sparred two rounds with Jack Stelzner and two more with Frank
Purcell. - . . â¢ .
Stelzner ls a big, strong, clever fellow, but McCoy kept Jack hustling to keep out of the way of blows that seemed
to come from all over. As a defensive boxer McCoy probably has no peer. He glides in and out of mix-ups, parrying
blows with right and left and landing all over an opponent at the same time. Stelzner says that McCoy hits harder and
is harder to hit than any of the top-notch heavy-weights, and Jack has boxed nearly all of them from * Bob Fitz
simmons down, so his opinion aught to be worth something. _j :.;
McCoy will do little work to-day or to-morrow. He feels that he Is In the best shape possible for the mill and, he
does not -want to overtax himself. â¢': . .
"A man can leave all his strength on the road or in the gymnasium," said McCoy. "When a fellow feels strong
and full of snap and vim he ought to quit hard training. That's the way I feel now and I intend to ease off a bit. {) *
--"I am in as good condition now as I ever was in my life. I realize that Choynski is a clever, hard-hitting boxer
and I think he will give me a good battle. I feel confident of victory, however, and when this fight is over I would like
to have another chance at Sharkey. ~
"Say, there's a funny proposition. Sharkey is telling every newspaper man in the country what a hard hitter I
am. Now, I'm much obliged to Tom. but then 'kind words*. don't do me much good. What I'm after is another chance
at him. In my battle with him I became convinced that I am his master. I believe in everybody owning defeat when
they are downed by a superior, but that's an awful hard thing for me to do under the circumstances. I was winning
nicely when he punched me low. The foul weakened me and undoubtedly lost me the battle.
"In the third round I walloped him on the neck and he dropped like a log of wood. When he got up again I
landed on him again and he went down the second time. I'm not making these statements to swell myself any. I sim
ply want to let the people out here understand the claims I have on Sharkey for a return match. I understand he is
going over to England to fight Mitchell. I will agree to stop Mitchell in four rounds. Sharkey can make twice as
much money fighting me as he can fighting Mitchell. If I beat Choynski I intend to press my claims on Sharkey for
another match." â¢

NEW COMMERCIAL BANK
FOR SAN FRANCISCO
WILL BE KNOWN AS THE ITAL
IAN-AMERICAN.
Its Special Interest Will Be Connect
ed With the Wine Industry
of California.
The Italian-American Bank has been
incorporated and licensed to do business
in this city. The title of the concern in
dicates nothing of an unusual nature,
but the names of the men interested in
the institution shows that it is another
move for the benefit of the revivified
Wine industry. Its officers are Andrea
Sbarboro, president; H. J. Crocker, vice
president. Its directors are P. C. Rossi,
Dr. P. de Vecchi, C. A. Malm and J. C.
Walsh.
Mr. Sbarboro is secretary of the Italian-
Swiss Colony, and president of the Man
ufacturers' and Producers' Association;
Mr. Rossi is the president of the Italian-
Swiss Colony; Mr. Crocker is the presi
dent of the Wine-makers' Corporation,
and all are interested in the promotion of
the welfare of the big corporation that
represents about 80 per cent of the wine
Industry of the State. â¢ Heretofore the
two wealthy institutions represented by
the officials of the new bank have done
business with the local banks generally,
but the encouraging conditions in the
wine industry have induced them to or
ganize a- bank through which to transact
the large business involved. Vice Presi
dent Crocker, In speaking of the new en
terprise last night, said: ._:â¢*.â¢â¢*
--"* The capital stock of the bank is
$300,000, divided into 3000 shares of a val
uation of $100 each, all of which has been
subscribed. The subscription books
closed .with a surplus. We propose to do
a regular banking busines, but the
bank's special purpose will be to look af
ter the wine Interests of the many large
and substantial producers of the State.
I. myself, am considerably interested in
the wine industry through the wine cor
poration; and our bank will represent and
handle a large amount of money with
which the local banks do not come in
contact." SBRSnj
As the wine industry of the State in
volves an investment of about $60,000,000,
and as the exchange transactions on the
export of the annual product are enor
mous, it looks as though the new bank

NEW BALLOT LAWS.
AA ANY of the laws affecting the electoral fran-
A ANY of the laws the Legislature which ad
chise enacted by the Legislature which ad
*-*.' . * journed on Sunday last drifted in the direction
of strengthening and re-establishing the regular poli
tical organizations. The effort was plainly to provide
statutes which will discriminate against non
partisan, "side show" and so-called independent "par
ties.". The Stratton primary law is distinctly a meas
ure of this character. It sets up a system of secur
ing primary action which practically discredits all po
litical combinations unable to control a complete city
or county organization.
Another bill, of which Assemblyman Rickard is the
author, is designed to effect the same purpose. This
measure was passed on the Saturday before adjourn
ment and is now in the hands of the Governor. It is
even more radical than the primary election law al
ready referred to, since it deals directly with the Aus
tralian ballot and strikes a blow at party designations
which cannot fail to have a telling effect.
Mr. Rickard's bill provides that the name of a can
didate for office shall appear in only one place upon
the official ballot, and that place is to be a column
headed by the name of the political party to which he
claims or owes allegiance. The grouping of the party
tickets which will be rendered necessary by this rule
will prevent a multiplication of designations. A can- I
didate, for instance, who appears in the column set'
apart for the Republican ticket cannot appear again
on a "side show" ticket. He must choose to be voted
for as a Republican or a Democrat, or as the candi
date of some other party which runs a regular ticket.
The bill also provides that no names shall be printed
alphabetically, but that each one shall appear under
the title of the office for which the owner stands a3 a
candidate. - ;".'"",
Under the Stratton primary law and Mr. Rickard's
bill it will be possible to again build up in this State
party organizations. The Australian ballot introduced
a system of voting which has resulted in the multipli
cation of independent movements, "side shows" and
"piece" clubs.- Instead of giving the people a freer
chance to select their rulers, the system has simply
confused political issues and put a premium upon
pluralities. The Stratton and Rickard laws (if the
latter shall be signed by the Governor) will practi
cally restore the old ballot system, except that the
names of all party candidates will appear upon a single
sheet, which will be placed in the hands of the voters
for such selection as they shall choose to make.
HONORS FOR MISS GOULD.
EVERY time Helen Gould gets an opportunity
to show that she is a woman of large heart,
generous impulses, and quick to extend aid to
the needy and suffering, with a modesty that never
fails she grasps the opportunity.
It was owing to the thoughtfulness of Miss Gould
that the Red Cross people were able to do so much
for the soldiers in Cuba. So marked were her efforts
and the success of them that Congress gave her a
.vote of thanks and a medal. This vote entitles her to
the privilege of the floor, and while it is not likely she
will avail herself of this, the honor is as notable as it
is deserved.
Now Miss Gould is to be given another medal, a
badge' which will permit her to pass the fire lines in
New York. There is hardly a likelihood that she will
put this to practical use either, but still the receipt of
it was doubtless pleasing. Miss Gould is perhaps the
only one among the rich women of the East who by
practical good work have found a way to the hearts
of "the people. She is charitable, unassuming and
ever ready to sacrifice personal comfort for the bene
fit of the distressed.
Of course Miss Gould can afford to be liberal, but
this detracts nothing from the beauty of her chari
,tfesârather, indeed, enhancing it.
Despite the fact that yellow correspondents were

ABOUT PARTY PAPERS.
SINCE the Legislature adjourned the Post and
Bulletin have indulged in jeremiads because a
Senator was not elected, and, affecting high
! tone on the subject, gird at members of the Legisla
ture for putting personal considerations above party.
Whether these two Burns organs are in crape over
I the party prospects or for a lost contingent does not
matter. They both threaten The Call and Chronicle
and use high words about the future punishment in
j store for all who opposed Burns.
It is a bad habit to write from the standpoint of an
j unmaterialized profit in a political event. The two
i evening organs of Mr. Burns were not shut out of the
! mails, and they had the right of way in street sales.
' One of them put in much time and space ridiculing
I Senator Perkins and decrying and belittling him, with
i the purpose of showing his unfitness for the Senator
| ship, and devoted the rest of its space' and time to
! lauding the genius, " talents, statesmanship, culture,
i honesty, honor, piety and fitness of Dan Burns for the
I Senate. The Post did these two things and asked the
! Legislature and the people to believe in its sincerity
I and soundness. ' It had its way. No one stopped it.
: Surely The Call had no occasion to feel its influence
i and the need of counteracting it. It abused Perkins,
; attacked him with ridicule and sarcasm, and wanted
Burns for Senator to take the taste of Perkins out of
â¢ its mouth." The Republican party and its majority in
1 the Legislature did not agree with the Post. Be
i cause they .did not the Post is now of the opinion that
. the party has gone to the bow-wows, and that The
Call is responsible for the disaster.
The Post should not mourn as those without hope.
It is not the first doctor who has seen his patient get
well after refusing to take his medicine. There are but
few Republicans who will agree with the Post that
the way to future party success lay in denouncing
Perkins and glorifying Burns.
As for the Bulletin, it is to the party .what em
balmed beef was to the army. When opened it smells
like carrion, and when taken it kills. Last fall it
j bolted in the midst of the campaign, supported a con-
I siderable part of the sandlot ticket and did its best.
i to so demoralize the party in this city as to put the
' whole State and Congressional ticket in jeopardy.
: Perhaps it did. this for a consideration. We don't
know the measure of its necessities. The motives that
( urge a newspaper to bolt a good party ticket to sup
port a bad ticket nominated by therfnemy are usually
apparent, but. the price it demands is estimated in
many ways. It may be based entirely on the loss of
the bolting paper to the party it bolts from, or on
the gain to the party to which it bolts. Measured by
either or both, the reward of the Bulletin would be
very small indeed. That it rushed from its party bolt
straight into the Burns camp and took up the duty of
daily predicting his election and extolling his many
virtues and talents would seem to indicate that the
drought in its affairs was unbroken.
But why should it complain of The Call? The Bul
letin had ample opportunity to convince the Legisla
ture that Senator Simpson used the language of truth
and soberness when he said Burns was "the grandest
Republican that ever lived." True, that was a little
rough on Lincoln, Seward*, Greeley, Grant, McKinley
and a few others, but The Call is not to blame that the
Legislature refused to believe it.
Finally, we have to say to our lightning bug con
temporaries, which flicker in the evening hours, that
The Call is and will be a Republican paper, and will
do its duty to the people, fighting against crime and
indecency whether found within or without the party.
If the two ephemera of the twilight desire to support
indecent and unnatural politics and to debauch the
; party to such vile ambitions as that of Burns it is their
'. privilege. But before they can succeed they must con
; vince the people that they are right.
A /RHETORICAL BLUNDER.
AA R. CHOATE, our Embassador at the Court
/ \ of St. James, has been sharply criticized
* * throughout the United States for his excess
of politeness in disparaging his own country at the
dinner of the London Chamber of Commerce. Much
may be condoned in the sentiments expressed upon
convivial occasion. Mr. Choate, however, is a lawyer
of eminence and of great experience. He should not,
therefore, have fallen into errors in his allusions to
matters of fact, even in a banquet-room. Among
other things he said in substance that the business of
this republic in subduing the North American conti
nent and turning the wilderness into a smiling and
wealthy garden is now "pretty well finished," and
that, for this reason, Brother Jonathan had donned
his seven-hundred league boots and strided first to
Hawaii and then to Manila.
The suggestion, however grotesque or humorous,
is so inaccurate that it could be corrected by any
California schoolboy. It was also injurious, because
it lent plausibility to the policy of expansion, which,
unless checked, would arrest our internal development
and destroy the American experiment of self-govern
ment. The fact is that our resources have been
hardly scratched, and that, with our present terri
torial area, they are capable of supporting ten times
our existing population. Mr. Choate spoke of the
capital of Great Britain and Ireland, in a country the
entire extent of which is 115,840 square miles, ex
ceeded by California, with 188,981 square miles, as es
timated, and not one-half as large as Texas, with
274,356 square miles. The republic he unintention
ally misrepresented, with its present States and Ter
ritories, covers 3,603,880 square miles, or 96,120 square
miles less than all Europe combined. The States of
New York and Pennsylvania are each more than
one-third the size of Great Britain and Ireland, and,
although among the oldest and most densely popu
lated members of the Federal Union, possess agricul
tural, mineral and commercial resources that would
sustain in comfort, under our American institutions,
as many inhabitants, proportionately, as the British
Isles. Passing to the Middle States and taking the
State of Ohio, with 39,964 square miles, as an ex
ample, its present rate of increase can be maintained
for more than a century without discomfort or over
crowding. The Middle West, including such States
a3 Minnesota, Wyoming,' the two Dakota's and Colo
rado, are actually in their infancy. The Great Salt
Lake Basin arid the surrounding mountains, the Val
ley of the Colorado, the undulating plains and mesas
cf New Mexico and Arizona, are filled with untouched
wealth. The State of Nevada, which in nineteen years
produced $448,545,000 in gold and in silver, a store
house of valuable mineral deposits, and requires only
fuel and water, both of , which are accessible, for its
sagebrush land to be converted into fine pastures and
fertile fields and orchards. . California, Oregon and

a nation great, and are soliciting Caucasian immigra
tion, without stint or limit, while rejecting the de
based Asiatic, and presenting an unbroken array
against the plutocratic demand for cheap labor.
These isolated facts are a complete refutation of
the inaccuracies that marked the rhetoric of Mr.
Choate, and reveal the underlying delusion that sup
ports the monstrous fallacy of Asiatic expansion. Our
constitution, our Union, our resources and our peo
ple are more than sufficient to utilize all our energy,
intelligence and capital, and should be consecrated
to the fulfillment of the trust we hold for the benefit
of ourselves, our posterity and the world at large.
PREPARING FOR CURRENCY REFORM.
WHILE the rush of war legislation prevented the
late Congress from undertaking the important
work of currency reform, the leaders in that
body did not wholly neglect the subject In fact, the
Republicans both of the Senate and of the House took
steps to advance the reform and to prepare the- way
for its prompt accomplishment when the next Con
gress assembles. â¢ .'â¢'*"
The Finance Committee of the Senate was author
ized to sit during recess, to consider currency and
other questions, with power to send for persons and
papers, to administer oaths and to employ needed as
sistance. The Republicans of the House appointed
a special committee of eleven to investigate the whole
subject of banking and currency, with the object of
devising a bill which -can be supported as a party
measure at the coming session.
Acting under the power given by the Senate, the
Republican members of the Finance Committee will
of course confer with the committee representing the
Republicans of the House, and the chances are that
when Congress meets next fall there will be ready
for submission a bill having the. full strength of the
party to support it. In such a case the prompt enact
ment of the measure can hardly be doubted. - " -
While the delay in settling this long discussed
problem has been to a certain extent injurious, to busi
ness, it is not without compensations. No currency,
reform bill could have been enacted by the late Con
gress except in the form of a compromise. ' The
House was strongly Republican,- but the Senate was
not, and the silver men would have fought a reform
in the currency almost as vigorously as they fought
the gold standard itself.
The Senate when it assembles again will be over
whelmingly Republican. It will be in full accord with
the administration, and ready to act with the House
in fulfilling all the great pledges made by the Repub
lican party to the people in 1896. What shape the
proposed bill may take seems at present doubtful. It
is safe to say, however, that it will proceed along the
lines laid down by the Indianapolis convention,
though it may not at once accomplish all the reforms
embodied in the comprehensive scheme supported
and recommended by the members of that conference.
The very fact that such wide differences of opinion
exist on the subject adds to the value of the arrange
ment that has been made by the Republicans in Con
gress to devise a measure which the party can
unitedly uphold. During the spring and summer all the
various plans proposed can be sifted and the way
cleared for a better understanding of the essentials of
a safe monetary system. When that has been
achieved the rest of the work will be comparatively
easy, and we may confidently count upon a measure
of currency reform as one of the earliest important
acts of the next Congress.
THE AUTOTRUCK MOVEMENT,.
ALTHOUGH at the present time Paris leads the
world in the use of the horseless carriage, as a
means of transportation, it is probable New-
York will soon surpass her both in the number and
in the effectiveness of such vehicles. For some time
past there has existed in New York an autotruck
company which has been constructing vehicles on a
large scale, and now a rival company has â  been
formed to compete with it for the trade.
The new organization bears the title cf the New
York Vehicle Transportation Company, and has been
incorporated with an authorized capital of $25,000,
--000. It proposes to operate on a somewhat different
plan from that of its rival, for whereas the old "organi
zation has announced that it will sell no vehicles but
will operate them itself exclusively, the new company
proposes to sell vehicles of all kinds in all parts of the
country. * : -y'-'v:
It is worth noting that while the French call the
horseless vehicle "automobile," the New Yorkers
seem to have settled down on the name "autotruck,"
and as that city is to be the center of their manufac
ture in this country, the name used there will prob
ably prevail throughout the United States. From the
reports given out it appears it has not yet been de
termined what form of power is best suited to the
new carriage, and the New York companies will con
struct them for operation by electric storage batteries,
gas, oil or compressed air, as desired.
The work of construction has been already under-'
taken on a large scale. The Providence Journal re
cently noted that a contract had been let to a New
England manufacturing company to furnish iooo
autotrucks, and stated the manufacture of that num
ber of the new vehicles involves the sum of about
$2,000,000. The statement shows the magnitude
reached by the industry, and demonstrates the confi
dence capitalists have in its development.
It is said the cost of operating the trucks designed
for passenger traffic in New York will be so small
that persons will be permitted to ride for any distance
on the public lines for 5-cent fares, and that the
speed will be as rapid as the municipal law will per
mit. It is probable both companies will operate
trucks for freight traffic as well as for passengers, and
the promoters are sanguine they will be able to
handle all the freighting and draying of the city at a
much less rate than can be done by horses. â â '
From these statements it appears the era. of the
horseless vehicle is about to open. When New York
leads the way other American cities will soon follow.
The large amount of capital invested in the manufac
ture of the machines will enable them to be con
structed under the most favorable conditions, and
therefore at the lowest possible cost Thus it " is"
probable that even when the inevitable trust controls
them they will soon be sold cheaply enough to come
into general use. , , -â*â¢. /: :â  â

HUNTINGTON IS
IN THE SADDLE
Members of the New Railroad
Commission Carry Out
His Programme.
Resolve to Abandon All Litigation in
Reference to Freight
Rates.
GOl<_lS P. HUNTINGTON has again
succeeded In withhold.*--? from pub
lic Investigation the books of the
corporation of which he. is the head.
This was accomplished- yesterday
through the medium of the members
of the Railroad Commission. The action
of that body bore all the Indications of a
well oiled piece of machinery.' There was
not a hitch to the, proceedings, and the
entire session, of the board did not last
much more than fifteen' minutes.
It was decided to abandon aa litigation
in connection with the attempt of the pre
vious board to make freight rate reduc
tions, and to put in a reduction of 8 per
cent on grain rates on tho 10th of April.
This is the substance of the compromise
j offered by the Southern Pacific Company
to the old commission, and shuts. the door
of inquiry into the affairs of the corpora
tion. It also places in the hands of the
railroad a powerful club to be used against
all future commissions which may en
deavor to come to the assistance of the
shipping public. Action adverse- to the
railroad will be met with the threat to re
sort to Injunction proceedings, and the
present outcome -will be held up as a
warning." Such are the views of those
who know . the wiles of the corporation
and who favored the carrying on of the
litigation to the court of last resort, if
necessary, in the interests. of the people.
At the meeting of the board held Mon
day Commissioner Blackstock presented a
report of his investigation of the litigation
pending between the commission and the
railroad, and followed It with the submis
sion of a resolution providing for the
abandonment of all litigation and for the
rescindment of the rate reduction resolu
tions adopted by the former board. The
resolutions passed by the old board, and
which were the cause of the pending lit
' Seat. on, called for a reduction of 8 per
cent in grain rates throughout the State
and for 2o per cent reduction on all freight
charges of the Southern Pacific Company
in California.
Blackstock's resolution introduced Mon
day was as follows:
Now, by reason of the premises, it
is by the said board deemed expedient
and for the best interests of the peo
ple of the State that said litigation j
be not further maintained or carried j

When there is a,. legal vacancy ; in the of-

method of stopping said litigation is
by removing the cause thereof,
.. Now, therefore, it is by the Board ;
of Railroad Commissioners 'of ' the j
State of California ordered and re-, I
solved that said resolution above re- j
ferred to and set forth be and the
same is hereby rescinded, annulled, |
vacated, set aside and repealed. â¢ v .
On the plea that they were not prepared
to act upon it. made by Commissioners i
Edson and Laumeister, consideration of It i
was deferred until yesterday. As soon as
the meeting was called to order by Chair- .
man Edson. Commissioner. Laumeister of
fered the following addition to the Black- 'â¢
stock resolution: ' " :â¢:* **** .-.*"-'.
Provided, however, that the board
shall at the regular meeting in April,
1899, to wit, on the 10th day of said
month, pass and adopt a resolution j
fixing and promulgating a schedule
of grain rates at least, equal to an ay- !
erage reduction of 8 per. cent as of '
date, September 14, 1895.
Blackstock moved the adoption of the I
proviso, and it was carried. He moved |
the adoption of the entire resolution as \
amended, and that also went through !
without argument or objection. And the
Southern Pacific was again in safety.
When the suit next comes up in the Fed
eral court no appearance will be made on !
behalf of the Railroad Commission. The !
Southern Pacific will ask for Its dismissal, I
and there being no longer any ground of j ,
action the railroad's request will be grant- I

Between now and the 10th of April Sec
retary Sesnon of the Railroad Commission !
will be engaged in preparing the schedule
of grain rates, which will be put into ef
fect by the commission on the date men
tioned.
Owing to the Inability of Stenographer
Brown to be in every day attendance at

keep them from starving until they
could bring down some game." They
continued their wanderings, and
about 1 o'clock yesterday morning
started for the country by way of
Valencia street. As they walked
along the street they came to a
trench and around it were lanterns
showing red lights. It occurred to i
them that a lantern would be very <
useful and Adolph appropriated one, t
taking the precaution to blow out <
the light. About an hour later Po- i
liceman E. C. Robinson noticed the <
two youngsters and stopped them. Â§
To his inquiries as to why they were <
out so late they said they had been i
visiting an aunt on Cortland avenue <
and had missed the last car. c
Robinson took them to the Seven- "
teenth street police station, and the "
airgun. bags of shot and the tin of i
sardines aroused suspicion, but they ,
stuck to their story. They were c
placed in separate cells and interro- â¢
gatod, and Henry finally told the ,
truth, and said they were going on â¢
a hunting expedition find intended '
to live on the game they would kill Â«
with the airgun. Robinson ac- .
conipnnied them to the Louvre lane, '
â¢where the kinetoscope box was re- '
covered. The boys were then taken <
to the City Prison, and yesterday <
â¢were charged w r ith petty larceny. '
Adolph's parents live at SIS.^J :

before, except an 'apple or orange <
from a fruitstand. When asked how '
they intended to open the box of <

to put it on the ground and fire at ;

enough to force it open. They will

THEY DID NOT I
PRAY FOR RAIN
Editor The Call: I saw in your in
teresting paper an article calling the
Honorable Board of Health's attention
to the condition of the Grand Opera,
liouse, complaining that it was
draughty as a sieve. What has the
Board of Health got to Â«do with opera
houses or theater-goers? It would
better look to the Pesthouse, a hospital
that is a disgrace to the world. The
patients are incarcerated, for no fault
of their own, yet are housed worse than
convicts. Talk about cruelty to ani
mals. Perhaps they look on lepers as
animals. The city clergy prayed for
rain. The patients in the Pesthouse
prayed for no rain, as there is a leak
in every bedroom. I know the Bible
says the rain falls on the just and un
just. I hope the next time they pray
for rain they will pray for it not to fall
on the Pesthouse. PATIENT.

ORDER'S BRIGHT PROSPECTS
GRADED ASSESSMENTS "WORK
BENEFICIALLY.
The Delegates Elect Grand Officers
and Then Enjoy the Play -'La
Belle Marie" at the Al
hambra Theater.
ThÂ© Grand Lodge of the Knights of
Honor held its first session yesterday in
the Alcazar builiding. There were pres
enV all the grand officers and representa
tives, and Grand Dictator Prescott L.
Archibald called the meeting to order.
After the committee on credentials had
presented its report the reports of Grand ]
Dictator Archibald, Grand Reporter John
s'one. Grand Treasurer Zehfuss and those
of the other officers and Grand Lodge â 
committees were presented and referred
to appropriate committees.
The report of the grand dictator gave \
I-, review of the work during the past two j
years. He called attention to the fact that
he Instituted a series of fraternal visits
by the lodges which had proved bene
ficial in arousing an interest in the. work
i f the order." During the two years one j
ast grand dictator, twelve past dictators
who were members of the Grand Lodge ;
and eleven past "dictators who had not
received the degree of old age passed over
the dark river. He said that the change i
from level to graded assessment worked i
a hardship for a time, but that now the
order had emerged from the difficulties
which surrounded It for a time, and that
there is a bright prospect before it.
The report of the grand reporter shows
that the membership on the Ist of Janu- j
ary, 1897, was 4054, but that by with- I
drawal 64, suspensions 1119 and deaths 151
the nun*.-" was reduced on December 31, j
ISS3, to 2720. In regard to the changes in j
the laws he says that they have been j
most beneficial as evinced by the finan- !
cial status of the order, which enables it j
to pay claims more promptly than before.
At the afternoon session several com- j
mittees were named, and the following j
were appointed a special committee to ,
devise ways and means to extend the in- !
fluence and increase the membership of
the order in California: Charles Lampe, j
E. F. Joy, A. M. McPherson. B. 1. Sal- j
omon. A. Carl, J. S. Alexander and Willis
Parris, with instructions to report at'
half-past 10 o'clock this morning.
The honor of past dictator was con
ferred on J. D. Martin of Occidental
Lodge, J. J. Ibbotson of Confidence, Aug-.
ust Wemquist of Yerba Buena. John P. I
Dwver of Yerba Buena. W. J. Thompson
of Far West. C. R. Brown of Tahoe. Paul j
O'Connell of Tahoe, A. Strohman of Le
land Stanford and John J. Beran of Le- |
land Stanford for valuable services ren- ;
i:._red the order.
Several tables of rates of assessment
were presented and referred to the su- j
preme representatives for presentation to j
the Supreme Lodge for action.
The grand dictator called upon the rep- .
resentatives from the several sections or
the State to give their ideas for the good \
of the order, and considerable time was j
taken up in this, but many valuable i
thoughts were expressed.
This afternoon the grand officers will be |
elected. There will be contests only as to (
supreme representatives. Two are to be j
chosen and there are four prominent can- i
didates. These are C. F. Curry. Secre- i
tarv of State; W. J. Rourke. \\ . H. ,
Bafnes and A. H. Voigt of Los Angeles.
There will be a strong fight for a repre
sentative from the southern part of the |
State. _ _ â '.
Last night the grand officers and a
large number of the representatives were j
the guests of the Past Dictators' Associa- I
tion at a dinner at 116 Turk street, a
very fine menu was served in the dining |
room, which was profusely decorated with I
the tri-colo-rs and American flags. Before
partaking of the bounteous repast M. L.
Crowe chairman of the committee of ar
rangements, delivered a pretty address of
welcome, and after the menu had been
discussed there was a violin solo by
Henry Larsen, accompanied by William i
Cellarius. A. M. McPherson, president of ,
the host association, called on Grand Re- j
porter Johnstone to respond to the toast,
â¢'The Knights of Honor," which he did in
a sensible and interesting speech. William
J. Oeary entertained with a recitation;
then "The Grand Lodge of California"
was responded to by Grand Dictator P.
L. Archibald. A. M. McPherson respond
ed to "The Past Dictators' Association," :
after which Past Dictator J. P. Dwyer
amused the company with ventriloquism.
"Our Sister Societies", was responded to ;
by E. F. Joy, past grand dictator, and
after a recitation Ben I. Salomon re
sponded to the "Ladies." The last toast
on the regular programme was "Our |
Country," by Past Grand Dictator W. H.
Barnes. Then followed songs by M. L. ,

were taken to the Central police sta
tion, where the former was booked for
vagrancy and the children for a pub
lic institution.
The rooms were filthy. Dirt several
inches thick covered the floors. In the
front room a conglomerated lot of fair
ly good furniture was stacked up in
utter disorder. The kitchen and bed
room had been entirely striped of fur
niture in order that there might be
more room for the carrying on of the
r spree in which Mrs. Delehanty and
her friends Were Indulging.
For two days the children had but
little to eat. The sole contents of the
family larder were five potatoes, a cup
of stove polish and the empty "growl
er." Mrs. Driscoll seemed to be the
only one of the outfit that had any
feeling for the little children. When
they were taken from her she
mourned their departure, . but when
told that they would be cared for she
: ceased crying and explained to the offi
cers the manner in which they had
been treated. The mother, she said,
took excellent care of her children
when sober. "The rotgut and steam
beer get the best of her," as the old
woman stammered out, and that tells
the entire story.

LEAF TOBACCO MAY
BE SOLD BY RETAIL
Hon. George W. Wilson, the new Com- .
MlÃSloner of Internal Revenue, has* Just
made a ruling which makes a material
change in the regulations govering the
sales of leaf tobacco. It practically re
vokes several of the rules heretofore
made and will be found much more sat
isfactory to the trade in California. The
Commissioner says:
Existing regulations relating to the sale
of leaf tobacco by qualified dealers in leaf
tobacco In quantities less than a hogshead,
case or bale are hereby modified with re
spect to cigar leaf, which may be purchased
by any qualified manufacturer of cigars
from "any qualified dealer ln leaf tobacco
in quantities less than the original pack
age for use in his own manufactory ex
clusively. Such sales shall be entered by
the leaf dealer in his Government book,
which shall show the date of sale, actual
quantity of tobacco sold, name of purchaser,
his business, district and State. No per
mit will be required for the sale of cigar leaf
tobacco as herein authorised. The commer
cial usage of billing the tobacco at ; the
marked instead of the actual weight will
be Permitted when the bill of sale also
discloses the actual welfrht of the tobacco
at the time of sale.
This ruling takes effect from March 16,
1899 the date of its approval by the Sec
retary of the Treasury. Heretofore the
regulations have been very strict against
the sale of leaf tobacco in this manner,
and though the trade and the local reve
nue office might believe that the regular
Sons were'overstrict. it was necessary
for the protection of the dealers them
selves that they be strictly enforced. The
department notified Collector Lynch that
the Commissioner's office noted with i sat
isfaction that the regulations were being
enforced in this district^
Affairs of Marine Firemen.
â¢ The preliminary examination of Ber
nard Ward, ex-financial secretary of the
Marine Fremen's Union, on the charge of
embezzling $4000 of the union's funds on
March 1, 1597, was commenced before
Judge Conlan yesterday afternoon. W.
W Foote appeared as special prosecutor
and Frank McGowan represented the de
fendant. A. large number of members of
the union were in the courtroom.
John Dougherty, the ex-treasurer, who
Is also charged with embezzlement, was
the star witness. He testified to going to
the bank with the check accompanied by
Ward who stood on the opposite side
of the street while witness was cashing
the check. Witness went over to Ward
and they both went to Ward's house,
where Ward got the $4000. Dougherty de
clared he never got one cent of it. Dough
erty said it was always the custom for
the treasurer to draw out the money by
check and hand It to the financial secre-
tary.
In cross-examination he said that Ward
told him the union was about bursting up
and he Intended to divide the 14000 among
the worthy members and if they would
not' accept it he would go to the end of
Harrison street wharf and throw the
officers who raided the place are re- â 
sponsible for the remark that if two <j>
servants kept the house in no better tt
order, a regiment would be required. X
to make it fit for a human being to <s>
inhabit. y
When the officers entered the house Â«j>
and took the inmates in charge Mary *?
Driscoll, the old woman who had been X
tending the babies, felt ashamed of the V
appearance of the place. With a broom rt
which had seen considerable | service <*>
she sought to rid the kitchen of its y
filth, and only desisted In her effort &
when advised to do so by the police. 2> j
The only article of furniture in the &
entire house which presented a re- '*Â£*
spectable appearance was the stove, tt
Mrs. Driscoll, it seemed, had taken a &
special pride in this part qf the fur- 2Â»
nishing and had kept It in excellent rt
condition. â¢*â *
The children were nearly starved and tt
when taken to the station and given 3*
food partook of It ravenously. When 9
the mother saw her offsprings brought Â£
into prison she cried, but the police <*
and officers of the Eureka Society tt
paid little attention to her, thinking 'Â£
that if she cared so little for her chil- V
dren that she would let them suffer X
when she was out of jail she was en- Â
titled to no consideration when under A
arrest. 7

Board of Education.
The Board of Education will disburse
$15,000 among the schoolteachers of this
city this morning. This represents the
major portion of the money held back
from January salaries at a time when the
finances of the department were in a
chaotic condition. At a recent meeting
of the directors; Chairman "Harry" Hoi
brook of the Finance Committee showed
the members how a portion of the money
retained from the teachers could be made
up, hence the pleasant duty of paying
the teachers will devolve on Treasurer
I. J. Truman this morning.
The warrants were handed Auditor Asa
R. Wells Saturday, and his assistants
hurried the work on them. They were
returned to Secretary Simpson, and with
Assistant Secretary Berliner he had them
ready for distribution in. a short time.
Each teacher will receive 15 per cent of
the January salary. This leaves a bal
ance of 5 per cent still due. The warrants
will be delivered this morning and the
Treasurer will honor them at once.
In the general settling of the city s ac
counts at the end of the fiscal year there
will be a sharper drawing of the lines
marking 'the responsibility for the pres
ent unsatisfactory condition. Some of the
merchants who are creditors of the city
through having furnished supplies for the
School Department are. already moving
in the matter. Attorneys have been con
sulted, and it is generally understood that
proceedings will be instituted. The plan
as outlined is to commence suits against
the bondsmen of the members of the ast
Board of Education and of ex-Auditor
Broderick. They are held to be respon
sible in the premises, the former having
passed and the latter audited claims in
excess of the amount allowed under the
one-tweifth act. The bonds for the ma
jority of these officials were furnished by
a surety company, and the fact that the
men are no longer in office does not ab
solve the company from its obligations.
The attorneys are confident the money
can be collected.
Funeral of Desirello's Victim.
Nearly every resiaent oi cimi.â _â ..â ,__-
ed the funeral of young James Johnston,
which took place yesterday forenoon. A
score or more companions and friends of
the murdered boy from this city were not
deterred by the storm from showing a
last mark of respect to his memory and
also by their presence at the grave to
evince their sympathy with the bereaved
family. The esteem in which the victim
of Constable Desirello's deadly pistol was
held was shown by the merchants of
Colma. all of whom closed their places of
business while the service was being held
at St. Ann's Church. The funeral cortege
was the largest ever seen in the town,
nearly all the attendants at the church
accompanying the body to Holy Cross
Cemetery. Father Cooper read the funeral
mass and also said a last prayer at the
grave for the repose of the dead boy's
soul. .
Mr. and Mrs. Peter Johnston, the grief
stricken parents, and their daughters are
very' grateful to the people of Colma and
to "the friends in this city who sent a
large number of beautiful floral pieces as
tokens of their sympathy. Mrs. Mamie
Smith, eldest sister of the boy. arrived
from Portland yesterday, and the funeral
service was delayed until 11 o'clock that
she might attend.
Hunyadi Was Not Ended.
Under the heading "Hunyadi War Ended"
some of the daily papers printed a notice a
short time ago that a lawsuit between the
owners of Hunyadi Springs came to an end
through a recent decision.. Information comes
from a competent source that a lawsuit be
tween owners of Hunyadi Springs has never
been before any court of the United States. It
is impossible to see how such a lawsuit could
come up at all, because the firm of Andreas
Saxlehner of Budapest In the kingdom of
Hungary Is the sole owner of any "Hunyadi"
springs ln Hungary.
Indeed, this firm of Andreas Saxlehner
brought a lawsuit against a certain New York
firm, because this New York firm uses on Its
bottles the Hunyadi name and a label quite
similar, to the labels of Andreas Saxlehner's
original Hunyadi Janos water.
This lawsuit Is pending now before the
Supreme Court of the United States in Wash
ington.
BY GOVERNMENT EXPERT
Paine's Celery Compound the Only
Spring R.mady Endorsed.
"I heartily recommend it, and am J
glad to give it my highest endorse- >
ment." . :.
So writes Miss M. A. Armstrong, the
government microscopist, after making
a painstaking examination of Paine's
celery compound, the one remedy that
has withstood every conceivable test
since it was first discovered by Dart-
mouth's great physician-professor and
its formula submitted to the scrutiny
i of the ablest practitioners in the world.
Thousands of letters have been re-
ceived by the proprietors of the remedy
from men and women in every com-
munity, all telling one experience the
immediate relief and perfect cure ef-
fected by this remedy.
The best physicians openly endorse
and recommend it. authorizing the pub-
lic use of their statements that Paine's
celery compound, in case after case,
cures rheumatism and kindred diseases,

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says:
"The prune situation Is one of strength, and
there la promise of Improving demand at ad
vancing prices. If the comparatively small
Quantities of outside stocks now held on the
spot could be* cleaned up, there would be an
advance in price on all sizes within a day or
two; but so long as the outside supplies are
held as a menace to dealers ln higher priced
goods, so long will prices probably stay down.
There lb a considerable demand from Interior
points and there have been some sales to
dealers at such points at about full prices.
The general supply Is so small, however, that
the sale of large quantities is doubted by
some dealers, though all admit that there Is
sufficient opportunity.
"Raisins are firm under the Influence of the
better conditions now prevailing on the coast.
There appears to be sonic doubt of the suc
cessful settlement of all difficulties, but it
seems likely that the combine will continue
for at least two years more. That Insures
the stability of this year's raisin market, and
a reduction in price by the association is not
expected. Present quotations are likely to con
tinue Indefinitely, or at least until Increased
demand and reduced supplies warrant an ad
vance. According to agreement, there can be
no reduction.
"Peaches are in very small supply, and all
available stocks, limited to perhaps a dozen
cars, are held with confidence. Some Inquiry
from Interior markets has been noted, but no
answers ware given, except at full figures.
Holders will concede nothing to secure busi
ness, consequently distribution Is restricted.
Exporters would do business, provided It were
possible to secure stocks at what they con
sider a fair price. Under present circum
stances they take no supplies.
"The supply of apricots on the spot is vari
ously estimated, but a conservative statement,
made by an authority on the subject, places
total holdings in this market at less than six
cars. Rome say three, some four, but It
seems safe to say six. Prices accordingly rule
high, and are likely to advance under pres
sure of Increasing demand. . The best range
up to 18"_c, with prospect of an advance."
EXPORTS OF LUMBER.
Exports of Lumber from this port during the
firft two months of the year were 1,668,000 feet,
valued at $50,031, against 2.479.000 feet, valued
at $45,641, for the same time last year.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 21.â The professional
character of the trading to-day was shown by
the fact that of the 630.000 shares traded in
nearly half were in but two stocks, which
moved most erratically. Sugar and Brooklyn
Transit. Immediately after the opening the
leading industrials were pressed for sale sym
pathetically with the sudden declines in Sugar
and Brooklyn Transit. An idea of the violence
of the movement of the specialties is conveyed !
by the fact that Sugar dropped 14 points from ;
the highest in the morning and Brooklyn Tran
sit 44. Subsequently they each recovered 7 :
points from the lowest, leaving Sugar 3 points
off on the day and Brooklyn Transit 1% up.
Accompanying the decline in Sugar there was
disseminated the denial by an anonymous of
ficial of the company that any deal with the
competitive firms was In existence. The early
decline ln Brooklyn Transit appeared to be
realizing on the announcement of the com
pany's absorption of Brooklyn Elevated. The
rally seemed to be buying on advance Infor
mation that the Brooklyn Beach Railway had
been bought in the interest of the Transit Com
pany. The prospect that the Third Avenue line
might, have to give up its Amsterdam avenue
privileges resulted in a break of 12%, and it ;
dipped to 200. The general market showed I
moderate sympathetic movements with the !
leaders and developed weakness when call 1
money rates reached 6 per cent and then ral- i
lied when money worked easier to 3 per cent.
Resides the financing of industrial combinations
there are several reasons for the present stiff j
money rates. One is the settlement every ten !
days, making six payments in all, of $1,000,000 I
to the Government in settlement of Central Pa- t
cific obligations. Another reason is the pre- i
paration for the April dividend and interest i
disbursement, and a third is a tendency to dis- i
count an interior movement of money which It
was calculated would last about three weeks.
London was a seller to-day of moderate
amounts of the Union Pacifies, New York Cen- !
tral and St. Paul, which . stocks, however, ;
showed fractional advances. The Pacifies, ex- :
cept Northern Pacific preferred, were up frac
tionally, while Central Pacific and Southern :
Pacific gained over a point each. The Grang- :
ers moved but slightly either way, and the mar- !
ket closed with an unsettled tone.
The bond market lacked a decisive tone and
gave alternate appearances of weakness and
Strength, with -the upward tendency in vogue
at the end. .
United- States fives advanced 4 and the new
fours coupon % In the bid price. The old fours
coupon declined %.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
! CHICAGO, March 21.â fear of crop dam
! age in Europe and indications of a late spring
I caused a better feeling In the wheat market
! from the commencement.' May opened a shade
higher at 67%@65c, and as domestic bad crop
I claims were as numerous as ever the price
I gradually rose to 6S%c. Bradstreefs report
of the world's visible made an Increase of
1 678,000 .bushels, compared with 2,5&7,000 bush
j els decrease a year ago. The market weak
; ened, on that information and May wheat,
which previous to the announcement had been
! bringing 68%'Â®68%c, dropped at once to SS'fc'SS
6S>/ic. It was steadied again, however, In a
few minutes by report of New York of 43
I boatloads being taken for export. The bears
[ made a savage drive about hair an hour from
I the close and depressed the market for a min
ute or two to* about the lowest . figure made
at the opening, but the closing price for May
i was f>sv 4 0.
Diminishing receipts and bad weather for
I hauling the grain to market strengthened
! corn. Another helping factor was a good
cash demand for immediate shipment to the
seaboard. May closed at- <&Â®%c advance. .
There was only a scattered trade in oats and
the market was Influenced almost entirely by
I wheat and corn. May dosed !4c higher.
Firmness of corn had a stimulating influence
â¢ on provisions, but the receipts of hogs were
i still too heavy for" any confident buying.
'â  Changing of May contracts Into later deliv
eries was the chief feature of the speculative
business. May pork rose 2%c and lard and
ribs closed unchanged. .- â¢

A circular from Australia says: "Since the
Moana left the following cargoes have been
delivered here from Australia, viz.: Crown -of
India, 2810 tons; Cardigan Castle, 1C92 tons:
m. P. Grace, 2898 tons; Brussels, 1470 tons;
Brenda, 3390 tons; Carondelet, 1945 tons; total,
14,205 tons. There are at present reported the
engagements of thirty-nine vessels to carry
coal from Australia, with a capacity of about
100,000 tons. This shows an addition to our
loading list since last mall, with an assurance
of a material swelling of same within the next
thirty days. The late seasonable rainfall al
most Insures us a very productive harvest, pos
sibly a phenomenal one. Following this. we
may reasonably expect an influx of tonnage
from all foreign ports. Future grain freights
already show a hardening tendency, and ship-*
pers are freely offering generous rates. This,
of course, means a relative reduction to coal
carriers. Most of our large consumers are
reckoning on purchasing their fuel below pres
ent asking â prices, as they are only providing
for their immediate needs, .anticipating to
make contracts later on at the then ruling
rates. Our fuel consumption this year should
be much greater than last, as the number of
ocean steamers has materially increased, and
the Government will become large consumers,
besides an Incoming overland rail way. will ap
pear as a large fuel purchaser this year."

A DRIVE.
Basseda Fell Heir to a Purse

Bonner Finally Came to
life.
The racing card at Oakland yesterday
didn't call for very much, but it attracted
v very fair crowd of racegoers. The
course was slippery, hut there was good
footing, and three favorites managed to
land.
Of the common bunch of youngsters
starting in the opening scramble for two
year-olds Prestome looked much the best.
The bay fellow was a pronounced favor
ite and won in a drive from Rachel C, a
I*s to 1 chance. The latter had been tak
ing it easy for a season and was finally
given her head.
Bonfbel was backed by most of the
smart ones to win the five-furlong sprint
that followed. closing a 2 to 1 choice.
Jones managed to beat bis field away
and, leading throughout, won driving
from Casdale, alO to 1 shot. Campus was
third.
The "split" of the race for maiden two
year-olds looked a "moral" for Corri
gan's Basseda, and the brown filly reign
ed a 2 to 5 favorite. Bamboulia, with Pow
ell up, managed to get a running start,
but Spencer shook the favorite up the
last sixteenth and earned the decision by
'a neck. Giga, away poorly, secured show
honors.
Obsidian, with his "Derby prep" on,
found the mile selling run, fourth to be
decided, right in his line. A 7 to 10 fa
vorite, the brown colt made all the run
ning, leading Malay past the judges over
a length. Rey Hooker, the third choice,
ran as if the alfalfa pastures were more
to his liking. Unfortunately, Powell rode
him, and some day this rider will nnd
himself stranded. â , _
Barney Schreiber's mudlark, Jerry
Hunt was considered a "moral" for the
(.print over the Futurity course, but seem
ed to be In no condition to race, running
unplaced. After Sir Urlan seemed to have
the .ice in hand Johnny Reiff brought
Stamina up with a rush, winning by a
neck. The winner was S to 1 in the bet
''fhe final mile selling run resulted In a
victory for the 25 to 1 shot Robert Bon
ner, ridden by Mike Hennessy. Second
into the stretch, the outsider headed Po
tente and, driving hard at the finish.
downed the ... rite, Benamela, two
lengths. -
Track Notes.
There is still more trouble in store for
Ed Corrigan and his Ingleside track. On
Monday evening at the Palace Hotel Billy
Beverlv, the .11 known penciler, asked
Corrigan for a return of the coin paid
in for two days of booking at Ingleside.
This coin was lost, for the police prevent
ed any laying of prices. Mr. Corrigan re
ferred Beverly to Secretary Green % and
the latter in turn told him to see Corri
i'-n The penciler -aid he had two books |

INGLESIDE'S BITTER LESSON
WHY SPORTSMEN SUPPORT
THE ORDINANCE. ,
Proceedings in the Police Courts
Against the Gamblers â
Efforts of Gambling Politi
cians to Interfere.
Corrigan and his associate gamblers In
tend to make a stubborn fight in the
courts -of the State to maintain in this
city the vice-breeding substitute of sport
at Ingleside. The gamblers have with
characteristic cunning given out that they
will abandon Ingleside if the courts rule
against them. As a matter of course, they
will be compelled to do so under such con
ditions, but the sure-thing men wish to
create the impression by their assertion
that they will not again attempt to resist
the law. They wish to lull the police, the
press and the pulpit into inactivity, but
In this effort fortunately the gamblers
will fall. They will never rid San Fran
cisco of their degrading and vicious pres
ence until the Supreme Court has passed
upon the ordinance which kills their traf
fic.
They are even now attempting to Influ
ence court officers. At least one Judge
has been approached by a notorious poli
tician and race horse gambler. Court of
ficials are naturally incensed at this sort
of Influence and some of them are likely
to express their resentment with consid
erable emphasis.
Corrigan and his Insatiable gamblers are
being upbraided now even by the book
makers, who denounce the Chicago ma
nipulator, while they naturally regret the
loss of a profitable business to themselves.
These men are gamblers by profession,
but they admit that their trade here has
been destroyed by an indignant commun
ity, as other communities where Corrigan
wielded a blighting Influence had already
done.
The most significant protest, however,
has come from the legitimate sportsmen
and horsemen of the city and State. They
see now that reform ls an absolute neces
sity, and that reform can begin only with
the destruction of the Corrigan evil. As
stated in The Call yesterday, the official
representative of sportsmen is the
Breeder and Sportsman. A very general
request has been made for the editorial
published in that newspaper on the de
struction of gambling and the notorious
"sport" of Ingleside. The editorial is as >
follows:
"An ordinance prohibiting betting was
passed by the Board of Supervisors last
Monday, as was expected by every per
son who has watched the trend of events
ln San Francisco during the past few
months, and since that time Chief Lees
and the police force under his control
have very succesfully enforced it. Since
seven months' racing was Inaugurated in
San Francisco a few years ago, there has
never been any doubt in the minds of
those who have read the history of other
communities that the condition which
now confronts the racing associations
would come to pass. It was as certain
as that night follows day. The only
strange thing about it Is that the asso
ciations have not realized the situation
and themselves taken steps to. avert it.
There lfl no grander sport than racing,
or a more honorable calling than the
breeding of the thoroughbred horse, and
to place him in a contest where speed
and endurance bring reward and pleas
ure to his owner is commendable. The
building of splendid race tracks with all
the appurtenances that go to make them
attractive to people of culture and re
finement, and the providing of purses and
stakes for equine contests, are worthy of
emulation. The wagering of money on
the results of these contests, when that
money is the honest property of the per
son who wagers It. is no sin. Racing is
a sportâ a sport of kings, it has been
called. But racing is like every other
sport on which' wagers can be laidâ can
not be pursued continuously without de

generating into a gambling game. Foot
ball as played by the teams from rival
colleges attracts thousands of the best
people of the land every # Thanksgiving
day, and nine out of ten of those who
witness It make some sort of a wager on
the result. There is no harm in it. It is
a splendid sport and an exhilarating rec
reation. But let football be played every
day for seven months in the year in one
community and it would soon be shunned
by all but the gamblers, and the people
would demand its suppression altogether.
"No sport can be conducted on a purely
money making or gambling basis and at
the same time retain its dignity or high
class. - Stake horses are given less con
sideration than selling platers where rac
ing is continuous, and as a consequence
the cheap horse is given a false value to
the detriment of the high class animal.
But the worst feature of continuous rac
ing is the almost total obliteration of gen
uine sport for sport's sake, and the sub
stitution therefor of gambling for gam
bling's sake. It increases the number of
'touts' and 'skates' instead of adding to
the number of breeders and thorough
breds. The great mass of the people rec
ognize this fact when they once become
acquainted with the game. The men who
compose the association have It in their
power to make racing a respectable and a
popular diversion. The Supervisors have
passed a law prohibiting betting, and the
most sensible thing for the associations to
do is to recognize the fact that this law
under present circumstances meets the
approbation of a vast majority of the
voters, and to take such measures as will
again make racing a popular and high
class recreation and sport. There is a
Damocles sword hanging over racing in
San Francisco, and those who have the
most at stake have the power to remove
it or to stubbornly refuse to budge until
it falls with fatal effect. One good reason
advanced by the associations for opposing
legislation that will limit racing to a cer
tain number of days in one county is that
it will permit the gamblers to establish
â¢merry-go-round' tracks in localities
close to the bay, such as In Marin, San
Mateo, Contra Costa and Sonoma coun
ties, and there run meetings that will ruin
the sport entirely and lead to still strong
er opposition from the people."
The proceedings in the Police Courts
yesterday morning were tame. In Judge
slogan's court Attorney Ach for the de
fendants. Prosecuting Attorney Joachim
sen and Chief Lees were present when the
case of H. L. Jones was called, and
Joachlmsen announced that the prosecu
tion was ready to proceed. Ach at once
demanded a Jury trial and asked that it
be fixed for the earliest possible day. Fri
day was suggested by the Judge, but Ach
objected, as he would be engaged in the
Superior Court. Finally Tuesday after
noon at 2 o'clock was agreed upon, and
meantime a venire of 100 will be issued by
Chief Lees, returnable Monday. The Chief
said he wanted time to get good men on
the jury.
In Judge Conlan court a request was
made by Attorney Ach and Chief Lees
for a continuance of all the cases in his
court for a week to be set, and the Judge
granted the request. .
Nothing further has been heard of the
demurrer to the complaint over which so
much fuss was made by the attorney for
the defendants last week.
"BOHEME"
REPEATED
Puccini's "La Boheme" was repeated
at the Grand Opera-house last night
with practically the same cast as that
of the first performance and with equal
success. The house was crowded.
Every seat was occupied, but a decent
regard for comfort and the law was
shown in the limited number of general
admission tickets sold. Beyond ques
tion this is the most remarkable pro
duction of the Ellis repertory. Melba
shows a new and vigorously dramatic
phase of her art in Mimi and De Lus
san is an ideal Musette. The applause
last night was as great as at the first
"Boheme" performance. There was a
storm of bravos and repeated cries for
repetition after the great quartet, but,
as before, it was sung only once. The
one change in the cast was De Vries,
who appeared in his own part of Schau
nard. His acting was excellent, but his
voice, even in the limited opportunity
offered by this role, was not in good
form. This production was reviewed at
length in an earlier issue of The Call.
All that Is necessary to say now is
that last night's performance was in
every* way as remarkable as the former
one. "Aida" is the bill for to-night,
with Gadski, OHtzka, Ceppi and De
Vries in the principal parts. Thursday
night will Introduce Melba's Juliet in
Gounod's Betting of the Shakespeare
love play.
Will Address the W. C. T. U.
Mrs. Partington of Portland, Me., who
has spent the winter in San Jose, will ad
dress the members of the Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union this afternoon at
their headquarters, 132 McAllister street.
Her subject will be "Hon. Neal Dow." It
is understood that she will also touch on
the work of the organization. Everybody
is Invited to be present.

IS IT A TRIFLE?
THAT COMMON TBOUBLE, ACID
DYSPEPSIA OB SOTJB
STOMACH.
Now Recognized as a Cause of Se-
rious Disease.
Acid dyspepsia, commonly called
heartburn or sour stomach, is a form
of indigestion resulting from fermenta-
tion of the food. The stomach being too
weak to digest it, the food remains un-
til fermentation begins, filling the sto-
mach with gas, and a bitter, sour,
burning taste in the mouth is often
present. This condition soon becomes
chronic and being an every day occur-'
ence is given but little attention. Be-
cause dyspepsia is not immediately fa-
tal, many people do nothing for the
trouble.
Within a recent period a remedy has
been discovered prepared solely to cure
dyspepsia and stomach troubles. It is
known as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and is becoming rapidly used and pre-,
scribed as a radical cure for every form
of dyspepsia.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have been
placed before the public and are sold
by all druggists for 50 cents per pack-
age. It is prepared by the F. A. Stuart
Co., Marshall, Mich., and while it
promptly and effectually restores a vig-
orous digestion, at the same time is
perfectly harmless and will not injure
the most delicate stomach, but on the
contrary by -giving perfect digestion
strengthens the stomach, improves the
appetite and makes life worth living.

AN EX-HANGMAN TELLS
OF TWENTY EXECUTIONS
Accused Murderer Brandes Listens
to Grewsome Testimony Given
by Amos Lunt.
Condition of Theodore Dnrrant's Remains After Hang
ing Explained in Court by a Superior
Guard.
The now noted Brandes murder trial has reached its closing
hours. The trial yesterday was replete with sensation. Brandes
was himself on the stand again and sobbed. Drs. Q. S. Eastman
and H. S. Buteau, as experts, testified that the dura mater taken
from the girl's skull showed beyond dispute evidence of inflamma
tion produced by blows upon tne head.
Amos Lunt, for many years high executioner at San Quentln,
horrified the accused murderer with a harrowing account of how
he has hanged twenty murderers during his experience at the
State prison.
To-day J. E. Harvey, who Brandes testified refused to go
after a doctor when he requested him at the time his daughter was
found dead, will again be recalled. "We propose to show Harvey's
true connection with the present crime, if such was committed,"
said Brandes' attorney, F. W. Sawyer, last night. ''Why did Har
vey skip out so soon after the girl's death? Why did he stay in
hiding in San Francisco until a reporter dug him up? And why
was he anxious to go to Canada, leaving the man who had befriend
ed him to fight his own battle? It will be remembered, too, that
doctors have testified that the girl was not virtuous. Harvey and
Lillian Brandes occupied rooms in the basement. Indeed, we pro
pose to give the jury something serious to think about."
Oakland Office Baa Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. March 21.
WHEN the Brandes murder trial
was resumed this morning the ac
cused was recalled. A few ques
tions were a^ked him about the
manner in which he says he drew Lillian's
trunk downstairs. Frequently during this
ordeal, mild as it seemed to spectators,
Brandos wept and sobbed.
Ho was followed by H. B. Mayo, a San
Francisco attorney, who testified that
Brandes in August of last year was at his
office with the girl and showed remark
able affection for his daughter.
Ono of Brandes' attorneys, J. E. Ben
nett, next took the witness stand and gave
a lengthy account of a conversation be
tween Dr. E. EL Woolsey and Deputy
Coroner 3tr_g_tiiâ when witness had
called the doctor to examine Lillian's re
mains. Bennett denied that he had agreed
-with Streightliff "to leave tho body just as
they had found iL"
Drs. Rowell, Buteau and Eastman were
next called in the order given and they
gave ax pert testimony as to the condi
tion of the dead girl's dur^a mater. Dr.
Rowel] was not absolutely certain that it
showed inflammation, but the others
HAS BRANDES CONFESSED?
It Is reported to-night that there is to be another sensation
in the trial of the alleged murderer oÂ¥ Lillian Brandes. It is a con
fession made by Brandes to his landlord, a man named Matthews,
who is also an attorney and whose home is in Berkeley.
Brandes, it is said, went to Matthews after the murder and
told him that he had found the girl dead, after being beaten, and
had arranged the bedpost hanging so as to divert suspicion.
Brandes was told of this latest story to-night in his cell and
said there must be a mistake. He made positive denial of such con
fession.
named were Tory decided In tho opinion
that it did so show. Dr. Buteau,. more
over, exhibited before the Jury several
epeclmens of dura maters, one of which
was normal and the others demonstrating
stages of meningitis. This exhibition ap
peared to have a distinct impression upon
the Jury.
Dr. Eastman also testified that the skull
of Lillian showed more blood staining
than is usually the case in a normal skull,
and that the stains axe ante-mortem.
. >. R. Elliott, who, since the commission
of the alleged murder, has occupied tho i
Brandes homo on graph avenue, was
next called by the prosecution and testi
fied absolutely that he had closely exam
ined the stairs leading to the basement in
the house down which Brandes claims he
drew the trunk and found no mark, dent
or scratch on the stairs.
Mrs. M. Godfrey was this afternoon re
called and reiterated and emphasized her
.testimony given at the Coroner's Inquest
to tie effect that when she was at
Hrandes' homo on Tuesday night, Novem
ber 15. she heard him tell the girl that he
"would beat her to death if she didn't
find that money." He had cursed and
Used profane language on that occasion.
' The surprise of the day, however, was
'now in order. The defense called Amos
Lunt, who for many years and until two
years ago performed the functions of
hangman at San Quentln. That bis sud
den appearance in court had a harrowing
effect upon the accused was evidenced by
the extreme pallor of Brandes. Once only
'did the accused murderer glance at tho
ex-hangman during his narrative.
"I have handed twenty murderers in my
time," said Mr. Lunt In response to a
! question from Attorney Bennett, "but I
seldom examined the bodies after the trap
(dropped. 1 have not usually examined the
one-inch ropo that is used, because there
are always so many people who want a
piece of this as a souvenir. So I do not
know of a case where blood appeared on
the rope. However, ln most cases of
hanging there Is Just a little abrasion
found on tho neck.
"When there was an execution it was
Â»ny duty to hang the condemned. I at
tended to that business. I usually went
'on the scaffold and took the rope down
from the beam and examined and tested
it I tested the knot. My ambition was
always to have everything right and cor
. rect. All I had to do then was to place
tho noose around the neck of the con
demned, pull down the black cap, tighten
the noose, take off my hand and give the
'signal and down it goes. That settles It."
It was hero that Brandes glanced quick
,ly at the ex-hangman and as quickly
glanced to the floor again, with an appa
rent shudder.
P. S. Brown, superior guard at San
Quentln, was next called.
Brown's testimony was even more in
iterestlng than that of the preceding wit
ness. Ho testified that he has had made
close observations in three cases of judi
cial hangings at San Quentln, particular
ly in reference to marks on the neck made
by the rope, C.:
"When the rope Is removed," said Wit
ness Brown, "I usually found It leaves a
reddish mark or. the neck.. In one partic
ular case, four hours after the execution,
â  the mark assumed a still redder color at
' the edges, with purple In the center-, and
finally it becomes a copper color. I also
examined the ropes after hanging and
never found on them any blood.
"In the execution of Theodore Durrant
tho rope was burned. I assisted in taking
Durrant's body down. In the latter case
and in that of Harvey Allendor I found
abrasions on the side of the neck opposite
to thai on which the knot was fastened.
On Durrant's neck there was an abrasion
on the. right side, but no blood, and no
abrasion on the left ride. Tho knot la
usually under the left ear. ._
! -"__â¢ mark on, # >Â»eck.flrat as*, j

Fumed a red color, then grew darker, and
when the body was removed the mark
was quite purple. The mark In usually
more distinct on the sides of the neck
than in front. Durrant's eyes protruded
and on his mouth appeared blood-tinted
i mucus. Two hours after death Durrant's
] face had the appearance of a man in
sleep. He bad not moved a muscle when
; the trap dropped and he fell dead, like a
log.
"Allendor was a smaller man, and af
ter he dropped he drew up his shoulders
; and heaved his chest. He dropped over
Fix feet. There was no abrasion about tho
neck or froth at the month. In both capes
, the features at first were horribly dis
torted. In some cases the eyes do not
i bulge or protrude."
By the testimony of these two witnesses
the defense aimed to show why no blood
appeared on the apron with which they
claim Ullian hanged herself, and the de
fense also wished to show the distinction
between Judicial execution and suicidal
in reference to marks on the neck, froth
at the mouth and appearance of the face
after death. *."â¢.â¢
J. E. Harvey was now recalled, but It
lacked five minutes of adjournment time,
and hence the trial will be resumed at 10
o'clock to-morrow morning:, when the de
fense promises another sensation. It Is
expected that the argument of the now
...,.-. . - . i
noted murder case will bo reached to
morrow afternoon.

MRS. GOOBY
CONVICTED OF
HORSEWHIPPING
She Also Files a Suit
for Divorce.
"I LICKED HIM PRETTILY"
BOUGHT THE WHIP FOR NO
OTHER PURPOSE.
Tells Her Story of Excitement to a
Jury and Expresses a Whole
some Desire to Repeat
the Dose.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 21.
"Guilty." And Mrs. Gooby did not faint.
For the first time ln Oakland's Police
Court twelve Jurors convicted a woman
this afternoon for horsewhipping a man.
The precedent for acquitting women, no
matter who they are or what they do,
caused the knowing ones to predict an
acquittal for the lady who chased an at
torney for two blocks with a cowhide a
week ago. But they were mistaken.
Mrs. Gooby made a splendid witness,
but not for herself. "Without any prose
cution that same Jury would have con
victed her.
"I intended to lick him," said Mrs. Goo
by under oath, "and, bless your Honor,
I did lick him good and prettily. I laid it
on for two blocks and chased him over
to Washington street with him running
like a frightened hare. I didn't swear at
him, as those men said who sat up' here
before me; I was too excited to swear,
and It would have taken too much time.
He deserved every bit of it. He swindled

cents a day and"
At this point Prosecuting Attorney
Leach and the lady's counsel, Mr. Hol-
man, both took a hand in Imploring the
court to stop the lady's volubility. Mr.
Leach did not see what past litigation had
to do with disturbing the peace and Mr.
Holman was anxious that the lady should
not voluntarily turn Into a witness against
herself. But It was all in vain. Judge
Smith cried "Stop, madam," and Attor
neys Leach and Holman both tried to put
a check on the witness" tongue, and Bai
liff Sam Mitchell tried to keep the lobby
In order; but above everything could be
heard the high-pitched testimony of Mrs.
Gooby as she told how she laid It on and
on and on for two blocks with the flee
ing attorney ahead of her.
while the witness was taking breath
Prosecuting Attorney Leach asked her If
she had any Intention of disturbing Mr.
Mitchell's peace before she went to his
office.
"Intention?" she said. "Well, you bet I
had intention. I Intended to do it for a
week. Why, bless your Honor, what did
you think I was going there for?"
While she was again taking breath Mr.
Leach asked her why she got the whip.
"Why," she veiled, "I got It to lick him
with, and I licked him. I told the gentle
men at the store that I wanted it to beat
some tine rugs with, but that (pointing to
Mitchell) was the fine rogue I wanted
to beat, and I made him dance, you bet."
In vain her attorney tried to prevent
her convicting herself. But she courte
ously told him to sit down â would do
the talking.
"And you deserve it all," she said, shak
ing her hand in Attorney Mitchell's face,
"and if I only had the whip here, saving
the presence of his Honor and these po
licemen, I would give you more of It. I
would. Do you think I would lie?" look
ing at her attorney. "You told me to tell
the truth to the court, and I'm telling It.
It's in my heart and God knows it, and if
ever I get another chance I'll lick him
again."
When It was all over Judge Smith read
to the Jury the section referring -to dis
turbances of the peace. It sounded very
cold and convincing, especially the phrase
"by loud or unusual noise or offensive
conduct or threatening to fight or light
ing on the public streets is guilty of mis
demeanor." -. ; â 
Then the twelve men filed out and for
once a verdict was returned that seemed
to harmonize wonderfully with the lady's
testimony and the section of the code read
by the Judge. On Thursday morning Mrs.
Gooby will appear for sentence, which
must not exceed $200 or more than ninety
days In jail. Her attorney Informed the
court he would make a motion for a new
trial.
Attorney Holman went from the Police
Court to the Superior Court and there
filed a suit for divorce on behalf of Mrs.
Gooby. She desires a separation from
her husband, substantial alimony and also
the homestead in West Oakland.

LOOKING FOR A
LITERAL GUN IN
THE CAMPAIGN
Dr. Charles Tisdale on
the Warpath.
WILL ANNIHILATE B.C. BROWN
AFTERMATH OF THE ELECTION
THAT EXCITES SPECULATION.
Scoring of the School ; Board Brings
About a Crisis and a Threat
of Personal v io
â¢ lence. >
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street. March 21.
Dr. Charles L. Tisdale, member of the
Alameda Board of Education and candi
date for re-election, has threatened to an
nihilate Bralnard C. Brown, secretary of
the Municipal League and official reporter
of the United States Circuit Court. Mr.
Brown has issued a deft to the pugilistic
physician and has challenged him to meet
him in combat at any time, but specifies
that the encounter must take place on
some public street of this erstwhile peace
ful city. All Alameda is excited over the
prospects of a gory outcome of the first
genuine gun fired In the municipal cam
paign.
Politlcs is at the bottom of the trouble.
Those who predicted a peaceful election
were false prophets.
The quietude that followed the nomina
tions of the two conventions was mis
leading:. It was but the lull before the
storm, and the political tempest broke
forth in all Its fury last night when
Bralnard C. Brown, who was scheduled
to address the Municipal League on cam
paign Issues, delivered a discourse re
plete with venom and vitriol charging -Al
ameda's Board of Education with cor-
ruption; asserting as a fact the existence
of a "ring" comprised of Dr. C. L.. Tis
dale, J. B. Lanktree, Cy Brown and
School Superintendent Sullivan. Tisdaie
and Lanktree are candidates for re-elec
tion.
While the speaker made passing men
tion of all connected with the alleged
"ring" the burden of his remarks were
to the effect that Dr. Tisdale was the
leader of the quartet. The speech and
subsequent developments have created a
decided sensation. Threats of criminal
libel fill the air, and citizens await with
breathless anxiety the final clash of the
principals.
Dr. Tisdale did not learn that he had
been assailed until late in the night. He
hastened to the nearest telephone and
awoke Brown from a slumber that was
apparently sound and peaceful. Judging
from the time it took Brown to respond.
Brown, who Is an expert stenographer,
grasped his notebook and made a record
of the conversation. To-day he gave it
to the press with some of the alleged lan
guage used represented by dashes and
exclamation points. Following ls a trans
cript of the record:
Dr. Tisdaleâ Mr. Brown, I am Informed
that you made an attack on me at the
Municipal League this evening. Is that
so?
Mr. Brownâ is.
Tisdaleâ I understand that you in
tend to publish it?
Brownâ l do.
.iJ 18 '!'''.'' -1 v ' ; ' nt You to understand, sir.
that I have stood all the non
sense from a man of your caliber that I
am going to stand. And I notify you now
that If you publish any statement, such as
I understand you made, I will hold you
personally responsible.
Brownâ All right, doctor.
Tisdaleâ I tell you right now that
I will sue you, and if I meet you on the
street I will lick out of you. I want
you to understand that, sir.
Brownâ right, doctor. What I said
shall bo published lf I can find a paper
that will publish it. Have you anything
more to say?
Tisdaleâ That's all.
Brownâ Then good-by, doctor.
Mr. Brown evidently went back to bed
and slept well, for he was up bright and
early this. morning and had a chip on his
shoulder. Ho Is satisfied he has sufficient
command of his props to "do" the doctor.
This morning he gave the following
signed communication to the newspapers:
"In return for Dr. Tisdale's courtesy I
desire to save him all unnecessary trou
ble, and to prevent him from wasting his
valuable time in seeking me out for the
purpose of executing his threat, I will
make him this offer: If he will kindly
name a place on the public streets of Ala
meda and a time within a week and.with
in the hours of the day when I am usually
In Alameda, I will meet him unarmed and
will give him the opportunity to 'lick
out of me' that he will probably desire
after the publication of the article which
so offends him.
"BRAINARD C.BROWN."
Mr. Brown is not the least afraid of libel
suits, either crlmnal or civil, for he went
right ahead and had his speech published.
The local papers this evening are filled
with it, and the people are anxiously
awaiting the outcome. It is the sole topic
of conversation among the politicians, and
it is freely predicted now that tho local
campaign will be exciting enough to suit
any one.
The address.' as furnished to the press
by Mr. Brown, is as follows:
When Dr. Tisdale took his seat as School
Director four years ago, having . been elected
to succeed . himself, â  he . was severely â¢ criticised
for his first official act, which was (after vot
ing for himself for president of the board) to
appoint himself Chairman of the Committee
on Classifications. That chairmanship he still
holds. It is stated that he divides the power
of appointment of teachers with no one of
his- fellow members. However this may be,
it is certain that the Classification Commit
tee ls a body which exists only in name; that
It holds no meetings as a committee; that Its
reports as made by its chairman ane not
aereed to by the committee, but are made
arbitrarily by, him; that when made they are
concurred in by . the triumvirate, Lanktree,
Tisdale and Cy Brown, who dominate the
board, and the teachers are disposed of ac
cording to the will of Dr. Tisdale.
It must be remembered that teachers In
Alameda do not hold permanently, but are
elected annually. There are nearly SO in the
employ of the Â» department, . or, to speak more
accurately, in the employ, of Dr. Tisdale.
These teachers ' are made to feel that their
tenure depends not so much on their qualifi
cations as. teachers as on their truculent sub
servlty to Dr. Tisdale and Superintendent
Sullivan. They know that if their acts and
the exercise of â  their supporting Influence do
not meet the approval of the political trium
virate their chances for re-election for tho
next year . will : be very few. -
The fact that four years ago Dr. Tisdale
AUott^^t(^hh n Be l t;t^, I tc^ea^plu R: ln _g
gift of the board, and the fact that he still
retains possession thereof (and probably those
facts alone) have given rise to a rumor that
the doctor's professional income Is materially
increased by his possession of this power. I
do not believe this. I am informed by those
who are in a position to Judge that his prac
tice is injured rather than benefited by his
membership in the School Board; that his
coarseness of manner before teachers and
pupils and his overbearing offenslveness gen
erally ln his touch with the School Depart
ment have not tended to improve his future.
Be that as It may, this rumor having reach
ed his ears, he vigorously denies that his
practice has increased one dollar by reason
of his official position. He loudly and re
peated asserts that be has on his books but
four patients who are teachers in the de
partment, whereas prior to his membership
in the School Board he had eight. He says
that instead of his official position being of
financial benefit. it is a positive Injury to
him. For instead of seeking the professional
patronage of the teachers and their families
he Is constrained to repel it for fear the
teachers may consider that they have a "pull"
on him.
The doctor's friends should accept his state
ments and should decline to support him for
re-election. They should see to it thai he be
not allowed to thus sacrifice himself for the
public good. And they should go further and
appoint a guardian over him, for a physician
who will for a term of years persist in en
deavoring to hold an office at a financial loss
needs a guardian. The protecting arm of the
law should be thrown around those depend
ent upon him. They should not be allowed
to suffer by reason of the disposition of the
husband and father to waste his energies in
working for an unappreciatlve public.
The Municipal League tendered Mr.
Brown a vote of thanks for his effort,
coupled with the Indorsement of the
League for the sentiments expressed.
Dr. Tisdale applied to District Attorney
Allen this afternoon to Issue a complaint
against Mr. Brown for criminal libel. The
District Attorney stated he would issue
the complaint if Tisdale insisted upon it,
but advised that it was not good politics
to carry a grievance of the kind into the
courts. , _ ,
Tisdale returned to Alameda this even
ing nursing his wrath. He has not yet
fully made up his mind whether he will
endeavor to punish Brown witn the stern
arm of the law or take the matter in his
own hands and carry out his threat to
"knock out of" his political enemy.

CHADBOURNE WILL
HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR HIS BILLET
Governor Gage Taught a
Lesson in Practical
Politics.
OUTGENERALED BY DEMOCRATS
Harbor Commissioners Upset
His Plans by Appointing W.
D. English Secretary.
INNOCENT Governor Gage has one t
more trial at "doing" politicsâ and !
Democrats coming to him. His
most recent attempt in that line has
not been so successful that you could
notice it at first glance.
In fact, the Governor would seem to he
"lust one Harbor Commissioner shy as the
result of his latest hand in the game.
It all happened at yesterday's meeting
of the Board of Harbor Commissioners,
when, by the election of William D. Eng
lish as secretary of the board, one of the
shrewdest moves was made by that
coterie of shrewd Democratic schemers
that ever upset an unsophisticated Re
publican executive. The appointment of
Paris Kilburn to succeed E. . _. Colnon,
president of the board, whose term has
expired, and Colonel F. S. Chadbourne,
vice Rudolph Herold. whose term has not
exoired, was announced by the Governor
only a few days ago. Colnon. Herold and
Major P. J. Harney, the third member,
are all Democrats, consequently the "ex
tensive patronage of the water front is
now given over to the army of the un
washed, and it was to reverse this condi
tion and place Republicans in the snug
berths that Governor Gage sought to su
persede Herold with Chadbourne.
Colonel Chadbourne was formerly a
WILLIAM D. ENGLISH.
THE newly appointed Secretary of the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners is one of the best-known Democratic politicians in the
State. From 1880 to 1888 he was chairman of the State
Central Committee, and under his guidance his party carried the
State for Hancock in 1880, for Stoneman in 1882, and for Bartlett
in 1886. In 1887 Mr. English was appointed president of the Board
of Harbor Commissioners, filling that office for four years. In _890
he was a candidate before tue State convention at San Jose for the
nomination for Governor, but was defeated by E. B. Pond. During
Cleveland's second administration Mr. English was appointed Sur
veyor of the Port, retiring from that position something more than
a year ago. He is one of the old-line Democrats and is rated as one
of the shrewdest politicians in the State. His present appointment
is for a term of four years, the salary of the office being $3000
a year.
member of the board, having been -ap
pointed by Governor Markham, March 12,
_594, for a term of four years. As his
term of office, would expire early in is***.
Governor Budd named Rudolph Herold
as hla successor during the session of the
Legislature two years ago, and the ap
pointment was confirmed, to take effect
upon the expiration of Chadbourne's term.
When the time came for the colonel to
step down anoV out he formally presented
his successor to the board in a long and
flattering speech, as the minutes show. In
which he bestowed every praise upon
Herold. It was on Chadbourne's motion
that Herold's bond and oath of office were
accepted, after which the colonel grace
fully vacated his seat in favor of the
Democrat.
It is right here that those Democrats
, get a horse on the Governor.
The trouble with "Chad's" friends Is
that they talk too much. Their loud boast
ing about the ousting of Herold and the
â¢seating of the colonel made the Democrat
ic members get together, and the result
will be that instead of Herold being com
pelled to fight to retain his seat, Chad
bourne will be the contestant, for not even
the power and the authority of President
Kilburn can save him.
Kilburn, of course, will take his seat as
president of the board without opposition.
He was expected to do so yesterday, but
for some reason deferred it until next
Tuesday's meeting. The term of offlce of
Mr Keegan. the retiring secretary', ex
pired several months ago. but as he has
made a most efficient officer the board
was in no hurry to name his successor,
although Keegan is a Republican. When,
however, Governor Gage' announced the
appointment of Kilburn and Chadbourne
the Democratic members concluded It was
time there was "something doing." With
Kilburn presiding and both Herold and
Chadbourne claiming a seat in the board
Secretary Keegan, in calling the roll,
could, by calling Chadbourne name, rec
ognize him as the de facto member and
force Herold into contesting for the seat.
But â  Keegan will not call the roll.
Colnon, Harney and Herold held a se
cret caucus and decided upon W. D. Eng
lish for the position of secretary. Mr.
English was president of the board from
is->, u> IS9I. and tis thoroughly familiar
with Its workings-*/ His selection as secre
tary was kept a profound secret, even
Mr.' Keegan having no inkling that he was
to be superseded until just before the
board met.
All three members were present and
there was much private conferring prior
to the meeting, but finally President Col
non called the members to order and Sec
retary Keegan read several communica
tions of little or no import. Then Colnon
leaned back and jocularly asked if there
were any Commissioners to be installed in
office. He had first satisfied himself that
neither Kilburn nor Chadbourne was pres
ent. , '
Major Harney, however, in some trepid
ation, staled that before such action was
taken he had a resolution to offer which
was of great importance. Without fur
ther ado he nominated W. D. English for
secretary, vice James J. Keegan, term ex
pired. All three Commissioners voted for
the appointment, Â«'olnon and the others
taking occasion to pay Mr. Keegan a well
merited tribute for his long and efficient
service in the office, he having held the
position for twelve years.
Mr. English was waiting in an inner of
fice with his attorney, T. J. Clunle, and
immediately presented his bond for $50,000,
which was accepted. The oath of office
was administered and. the joke on Chad
bourne and the Governor was completed.
When the board meets next â¢ Tuesday <
there is going to be an exhilarating time, <
Mr. Kilburn will take his seat without op- <
position. Chadbourne will also be on (
hand, hut Instead of Mr. Keegan giving
him the benefit of having his name in
the rollcall Mr. English will perform that (
service for Herold. "Chad may claim <
the seat. He may be recognized by Presi- i
dent Kilburn, whe will undoubtedly re- <
fuse to recognize Herold; but Herold will (
do the voting and * President Kil
burn will be powerless to prevent
him. This will give him the ad- '
vantage of appearing on the minutes i
as a sitting member of the board and i
force Chadbourne into the awkward post- (
tion of being the contestant. This Is bad ,
enough at best, but there is the further
embarrassing fact that after inducting '
Herold into office, paying him a flattering <
compliment apd moving that his bond and I
oath be accepted. Chadbourne is now try- i
ing to take the job away from him. ,
And Governor Gage has had some more
experience In politics. It's a great game,
isn't it? i

in liquor Ellen Curry, aged 50 years, liv- '
ing at 120 Sixth street, ran afoul* of an !

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALX,, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22. 1899.
CRUSHED TO
DEATH UNDER
BUGGY WHEELS
Isaac W. Jones Was
the Victim.
JULES GAMAGE THE DRIVER
IN HIS BUGGY WERE W. B. JEN
NINGS AND A. W. BROWN.
The Aged Victim Was Attempting to
Cross O'Farrell Street When
He Was Knocked Down
and Trampled Upon.
Isaac W. Jones, an aged lottery dealer,
was knocked down, run over and killed
last evening at the junction of Market
and O'Farrell streets and Grant avenue
by a buggy driven by Jules Gamage,
president and manager of the Harding
Collection Agency.
W. B. Jennings, the well known horse
man, and A. W. Brown, who resides at
the Palace Hotel, were with Gamage in
the buggy at the time the old man was
struck down.
Gamage and his companions had Just
turned into O'Farrell street from Market,
and when the buggy was between tho
curbstone and a car that was at the ter
minus Jones attempted to cross the street.
He did not see the buggy before it was too
late. The shaft struck him and knocked
him down. The horse grew frightened
and pawing the old man under his hoofs
he dashed up O'Farrell street at the top
of his speed. The wheels of the buggy
so heavily laden passed over the prostrate
man and rendered him unconscious. â¢
He was sent to the Receiving Hospital,
but the doctors there saw at once that it
would be impossible to save Jones' life.
His skull was badly crushed, his collar
bone broken and he -had sustained severe
internal injuries.
After knocking the aged pedestrian
down Gamage's horse- became unman
ageable and had run quite a distance be
fore he could be controlled. When he.
succeeded in stopping the spirited animal' j
Gamage left his buggy in cnarge of Jen
nings and Brown and returned to the
scene of the accident. ''.-image claims not
to have realized the seriousness of the old
man's condition, otherwise he states he
would have, surrendered himself to the
police at once. He says he was driving
slowly and was in no way to blame for
the sad accident. When seen last night
Mr. Carnage made no attempt to deny
that he was the driver of the buggy. . He
had not heard anything of his victim's
condition, and grew alarmed when in
formed that Jones was probably fatally
injured. At the time of the interview the
aged lottery dealer was still alive. He
died shortly after 11 o'clock, and his body
was removed to the Morgue. The de
ceased resided at 533 Fifth street.
"I was not driving fast when mv buggy
struck the man," said Mr. Gamage when
seen last night. "We. were driving up
from the Palace Hotel, where I had been
attending to some business. My horse is
a very spirited animal, but I had full con
trol of him up to the lime the shaft
struck the man who was attempting to
cross the street in front of us.
"When I drove up to the Junction of
Market, Grant avenue and O'Farrell
street. I was compelled to slow up to
pass the string of people who were walk- !
ing up and down Market street. It was I
only a few feet further up where I struck ]
the man. so I could not under any cir- I
cumstances have been driving fast. My
horse was walking up to the time the
man tried to pass us.
"I sincerely hope that the old gentle
man's injuries will not prove fatal. It
was an unavoidable accident that I would
not have happen again for all the world. I
will give myself up to the police the first j
thing in the morning."

ploye of Fllnn & Treacy, contractors, was crushed to death by falling
earth while working in a trench in Clinton Park, at the intersection

*â¢* Vs__/ -workmen were at work at the bottom of the trench preparing it for
pi the reception of sewer pipe, when without warning the ground, softened by
S? the heavy rain, caved in upon them. Keough was caught in the falling de-
% bris. His companions escaped without injury, and immediately began digging

2 over with picks and shovels and aided in the attempted rescue. After fif-
-2 teen minutes of hasty digging the body of Keough was found, but life was
a extinct.
Â«Â£ It was the consensus of opinion that had the workmen been more care-

2 caved in as a natural result.

committed last night. John Epperson ' a
jockey and part owner of Texarkana and
Bessie Lee. was beating James J. GHBU
pan. when Gilligan towapoke ]""Â«
and plunged It into the jockey s jugular
% The murder was the result of one of the
usual revolting incidents that are of
nightly occurrence at the saloons sur
rounding the Emeryville track. Monday
night Epperson and Gilligan quarreled
over a game at cards. The men parted
in anger and nursed their hatred of each
other all to-day. This evening they were
drinking in the Office saloon, run by Ken
nedy & Duier. which is near the entrance
to the racetrack. Words passed between
them and they went out. .
Before long they returned and renewed
their quarrel. Epperson is much more
powerful than Gilligan, and when they
came to blows the jockey had no diffi
culty whatever in throwing the boy and
falling on top of him. He was fast sub
duing Gilligan when the boy drew his
knife and plunged it directly Into Epper
son's jugular. The wound was apparently
so slight that Epperson was not inclined
to treat it seriously, but a few minutes
later he was dead. --,':.-"
As soon as he realized that he had killed
his foe. young Gilligan went into a saloon
and' said he wished to give himself up.
The loafers about the place only laughed
at him and told him to get out. No one j
made any attempt to detain him. and the
lad with blood all over his clothes, disap
peared from Emeryville and went straight
to San Francisco. _â _Â».*â¢_'_"â¢â '
The hangers-on at the track and the dis
reputable characters who infest the place |
seemed to consider the whole affair in the i
light of a diversion, and instead of aiding
In his arrest did everything possible to
induce him to make his escape. _ â '_
H J. Duier, the senior member of the
saloon firm, was also reticent until forced
for a statement by Sheriff Rogers. To the
latter he said, substantially: -'Gilligaii
and Epperson came to my place about 5
O clock this evening and had drinks. Soon
they began quarreling. Then they went
to a lot near by and had a scrap, Epper
son coming out ahead. They again stepped
into my saloon and drank together, and
the next thing I knew both were on the
Boor, Epperson on top. I went and sepa
rated them. When Epperson told me that
his jugular was cut I placed him in a
chair and Gilligan walked out. I did not
see any weapon. A few minutes after
placing him in the chair he died. We did
not think, at flrst. that he was very seri
ously hurt v The wound is only about an
inch long, but it did the work."
â¦ o An effort, it is said > was made to ob
tain the services of a doctor, but no one
appeared at all anxious, and Epperson
died unattended. His body was at once
taken to the Morgue.
Sergeant Scanlan afterward asked
Duier as to who had telephoned for the
Pu -^ol wagon. "Some one had telephoned
that there was a man to be taken to the
Receiving Hospital," said the sergeant,
and that his assailant whs being held."
l'tii'-r did not remember. The officer then
called Diner's attention to the bad rep
utation of the office saloon, remarking
that Cronin had also been murdered near
the place. "I don't care if there is a man
killed here every night," replied Duier;
"it s none of my business." The Office
saloon was formerly run by "Fat" Hig
gins, who recently transferred his inter
est to" Kennedy and Duier. The police
regard the joint as one of the most no
torious in Alameda County.
The hangers-on at the saloon showed
their contempt for the officers by yelling
and cheering gleefully when they saw
them leave without their man. During
the whole affair Town Marshal Cushing
failed to materialize. There appeared to
be every reason for the police suspecting
that an attempt was being made to de
lude them.
An inquest will be held probably next
Thursday night. An examination of the
body revealed but one gash, the one sev
ering the jugular vein. This gash is clean
cut and about half an inch long. Some
one had placed absorbing cotton over the
wound and tied a kerchief around the
neck. &_W
Epperson was a native of London. Can
ada, aged 32 years. From letters found on
his person it is judged that he had evi
dently regarded Granite, Mont., his home.
One of these letters was signed by "Rose
Epperson," presumably his wife, written
at Granite. Another letter is from Police
man Jack Sherry of the Oakland force
and relates to a racehorse, Texarkana, In
which Sherry, George Bowley and de
ceased were Interested. In a small note
book was found jotted down the expenses
for keeping of the horses Texarkana and
Bessie Lee, and these items were written
beneath an apparent firm name of Sherry
& Epperson.
As to the antecedents of the deceased,
all kinds of .rumors are heard. By some
Epperson was regarded a dangerous man.
Recently he was mixed. up in a flght at
the Ingleside track and came out with his
right middle finger bitten off. Withal his
reputation seems to have been unsavory.
James Gilligan is said by some of the
officers at the track to be an Inoffensive
fellow and one who never sought trouble.
He Is regarded by some as being simple
minded, and all agree that he was under
Epperson when he made the fatal plunge.
He has acted as valet to jockeys and as
horse-rubber, and has never been in
trouble before. It Is said that Epperson
has a record of having taken two human
lives during his career.
The killing of Epperson is the third
murder that has made the Emeryville
track notorious. Two years ago Deputy
Constable Denny Cronln, a man of fam
ily, was shot outside the Office saloon by
James Bryan, a lad who is now in San
Quentin. Some time later J. H. Raesido,
a mason, was discovered on the railroad
track at Emeryville horribly mutilated.
An investigation showed that the man
had been murdered before being placed
on the track, but the murderer wa* never
found.
Gilligan, the slayer of Epperson, was ar
rested late last night at his home, 1413
Baker street. Policeman Altken saw him
emerging from his home, and accosting
him he asked him if his name was Gil
ligan.
"Why, no," smilingly exclaimed Gilli
gan. "My name is Murphy."
Recognizing him from the description
given of him by the Oakland police, Ait
ken told him that he was wanted at
police headquarters.
"I guess the jig is up," replied the mur
derer. "You've got the right man this
time."
After admitting that his name was Gil
ligan, the slayer of Epperson extended his
hand as if anticipating that the officer
was about to place the irons on his wrist.
He was then handcuffed and taken to the
City Prison, where he was booked' en
route to Oakland. ,
When asked for his version of the trag
edy Gilligan, who is only 23 years of age,
said: "The cutting was the result of a row
Epperson and I had last summer in Butte
City, Mont. He was beatlner an Innocent
stable boy when I interfered. He then
started to assault me and in the struggle
that followed I nearly put him out.
"When we met last evening I was with
a stable boy named Tommy Brennan. I
had Brennan by the arm, intending to
take him to the train, as he was anxious
to return to San Francisco to see some of
his friends. As soon as Eppinger saw us
he walked up to us and with an oath
dragged Brennan away from me. I ex
postulated with him, when he struck me.
knocking me down. As I lay prostrate he
repeatedly kicked me In the head and
body. A "prize fighter, who Is known as
Spike Sullivan, thinking he Intended to
kick me to death, took a hand at this
juncture and dragged Epperson away
from me. I walked Into the rear room of
the saloon to wash the blood off' my face,
when I heard Eppinger declare that I was
no good and that he was going to lick me
every time he met me. There was a small
knife on the shelf In the room, and pick
ing It up I determined to defend myself.
As I emerged from the room Epperson
started after me, evidently intending to
again asault me, when I raised the knife
and stabbed him in the neck. I then ran
from the place and took the first train
for. this city. Knowing that the police
