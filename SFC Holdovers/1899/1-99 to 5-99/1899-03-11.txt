GOMEZ WILL DISOWN
THE CUBAN ASSEMBLY
Special Cable to The Pall and the Nrw York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9&, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, March 10. â General
Gomez will disown the Cuban
Assembly. Disgusted with the
petty jealousies of the members.
and irritated at the antagonism
evinced toward himself, he will dis
claim all connection with that body
and dispute its right to control his ac
tions.
Relying upon his popularity with the
Cuban people he will proceed to discuss
with General Brooke the settlement of
the problem of the pacification of the
country without regard to the action
of the Assembly, which has by its un
dignified conduct and bitter sentiments
of hostility to Americans lost the con
fidence of sober-minded Cubans.
This was the statement made to me
to-night by a member of the Assembly
who has looked after Gomez' Interests
there and possesses the old chief's con
fidence. It Is confirmed by other offi
cials who are in touch with the Cuban
general.
The conservative element in the city
expresses its satisfaction that General
Gomez, whose honesty of purpose is be
lieved in, has cut himself loose from a
faction whose sole work appears to be
to discuss in secret session who shall
be the first President.
It Is also declared that Gomez has
decided that th- $3,000,000 granted by
the United States shall be distributed
only to soldiers who actually served in
the Cuban war and were under arms
before the declaration of war between
the United States and Spain. This will
probably reduce the number of par
ticipants to 30,000 or under.
SANTIAGO, March 10.â The results
of the policy inaugurated at Havana of
discontinuing public works in this
province and throwing men out of em
ployment are beginning to show. Yes
terday six bandits were captured in the
neighborhood of Concepcion, all of
whom were formerly workers in the
road gangs. They say they have no
means and must either rob or starve.
They have been lodged in the City Jail,
but considerable sympathy is displayed
in their behalf by the populace.
Much the same sort of thing is hap
pening in the district of Holguin. where
a brush between bandits and gendarmes
result* in the killing of one of the
former. Nevertheless it is not ex
pected that these troubles will take a
serious turn, owing to the probability
that work will be resumed next week.
TO ADVANCE
ON MALOLOS
IMMEDIATELY
General Lawton Will Lead

Otis to Give His Attention to Civil
Government and the Outside
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call. |
NEW YORK, March 10.â Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel- j
egraphs: The arrival at Manila to-day
of General Lawton with reinforcements, .
as cabled to the War Department, j
means the beginning of an active cam- j
paign against the Filipinos. General ,
Lawton will have, under General Otis, j
command of all military operations in j
Luzon, while 'tis, as Governor General, j
will direct the conduct of civil affairs j
and the military operations in other
islands. 1
It was thought the advance of General
Hale's brigade several days ago was
the beginning of a forward movement,
but it is supposed that General Otis
decided to await the arrival of Lawton.
Now it is expected that offensive opera
tions will begin at once and be directed
toward Malolos, the seat of the .insur
gent government, which the officials say
will soon be occupied by American
troops.
Instructions were cabled to General
Otis to-day directing him to detach
Brigadier General M. P. Miller from the
command of troops at Iloilo and order
him home for retirement. General Otis
will choose General Miller's successor,
who will probably be General Anderson
or General Mc Arthur.
-General Miller's retirement on March
27 will create a vacancy in the grade
of brigadier general of the regular
army, which in all probability will be
filled by the appointment of General
Sumner. The latter is likely to be re
tired at once and General Anderson
made brigadier of the regular service
so that that officer will not be given a
volunteer commission as major general,
as originally determined.
The cablegram received at the War
Department to-day dated Manila,
March 10. says the transport Grant ar
rived with the troops in good condition.
The Arizona and Newport leave to-day
for San Francisco, the Arizona via
Hongkong and the Newport via Na-
I gasaki. The Grant carried to Manila
the Fourth Infantry and four com
panies of the Seventeenth Infantry.
This adds to the troops under the
command of General Otis 42 officers and
1716 enlisted men. The Grant, with
.General W. B. Lawton in command,

TO REMAIN
Long for Vengeance on the
Filipinos for Their Com

War Department Decides It Has
Authority to Keep Officers
and Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINTON, March 10.â One of the
paragraphs of the army reorganization
act contained an, authorization for the
enlistment again of the volunteer
troops now in the Philippines. j It was
stipulated that these troops should be
re-enlisted only for a period of time
necessary to replace them by regular
troops, in no case longer than . six
months. r .
The question has been presented to
the War Department of whether or not
it was aide, under this provision, to
avail of th" services of the officers of
the volunteer regiments as well as of
the enlisted men until the troops can
be replaced by regulars.
The law officers of the department
have concluded that the word "enlist"
employed in the act was used in a broad
sense and that therefore the President
has authority to take over all the vol
unteer regiments now at Manila and
j other points in the Philippines into the
; service of the United States in organ
' izations, with their full complements
I of officers and men.
It has been presented that the vol
unteers there are longing to return to
the United States and to private life.
The officials say that this is a mistake.
General Otis has reported that the men.
volunteers as well as regulars, do not
want to come home, but are anxious to
fight and crush the insurgents. Nearly
every company has suffered through
the wounding of some of its. members
at the hands of sharpshooters and they
are. anxious to make the account even.

ARTILLERY ORDERED
TO THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON. March 10.â In view
of the possible necessity of having to
use more artillery at Manila in the fu
ture than has been required in the past,
the War Department issued orders to
Battery B, Sixth United States Artil
lery, now at Fort McHenry, to move as
soon as possible to San Francisco, there
to take ship for Manila. Two light bat
teries of the Sixth are already at Ma
nila, and the rest of the regiment has
been ordered there, but some of it may
stop at Honolulu, relieving the Second
United States Volunteer Engineers
now there. The Sixth is one of the two
regiments authorized by Congress last
March.

â¢â¢-. Washington, March 10.
If San Francisco is to make a bid for
one or both of the national conven
tions next year, it behooves her citi
zens to begin their campaign even as
early. as this, for New York has ac
tually entered the field to capture both.
A committee has been appointed- by
the Boards of Trade to look after the
matter. New York has had a hanker
ing for a political national convention
for a good many years, but it has
usually waited until the eleventh hour
before making any move toward se
curing it.
New York .possesses many attrac
tions as a convention city. It has a
building suitable for the purpose, and
it can also accommodate all visitors
without the slightest inconvenience. It
is safe to say that the national con
ventions next year will be either held
in. New York or Chicago. After the
experience -of the Republicans at Min
neapolis in 1892 and' at St. Louis in 1896.
the leaders of that organization are
convinced that it. is a mistake to hold
their convention in any place outside of
Chicago. or. New York.
The Democratic .leaders hold similar
views. They selected Chicago In 1896.
although that town offered no special
inducements.
Mr. Croker: and his friends will no
doubt endeavor to have the Democratic
National Convention of 1900 held in
New York. The .supporters of Bryan
favor Chicago, and as they are In
control of the Democratic National
Committee,' the chances are that the
latter city will be selected. However
if New York . offers sufficient induce
ments It may stand a snow of getting
the Republican convention. .
The., principal objections heretofore
urged against San Francisco have been
distance, lack of telegraph facilities
and the difference in. time.

PLOTTED TO
MURDER THE
AMERICANS
Porto Ricans Want Their
Freedom and Will Fight
for It.
FEELING VERY BITTER
Conspiracy Discovered to Enter
Barracks and Machete Soldiers
by Wholesale.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, March Colonel
Hubbell, who returned with his com
mand, the Forty-seventh Regiment,
from duty in Porto Rico on the trans
port Manitoba to-day, gave some inter
esting information to-night about the
condition of affairs in our new West
Indian possessions.
"There are many persons," he said,
"who think we were welcomed to Porto
Rico and sent away amid a shower of
bouquets. This was not the case. The
Porto Ricans do not like the Ameri
cans. They want and are planning for
their freedom.
"We had more or less trouble all the
time with these natives, but their hos
tility was more openly displayed when
it was learned that we were going to
leave. All the while we were subjected
to petty annoyances. A number of at
tempts were made to knife our sentries.
The natives are treacherous and we
had to use severe measures at times.
"There was at no time an open in
surrection, but I discovered three
weeks ago evidence that the so-called
'Educational Society' was strong and
bitter in its antagonism. They held
meetings which we dispersed. We dis
covered and nipped in the bud a con-
spiracy which had for its object an en
trance into our barracks and the
wholesale macheting of our soldiers.
"Unless there is a great chance, I am
convinced that sooner or later there
will be serious trouble down there. I
should, however, qualify their feeling
by saying that they hate Americans,
not for their personality, but because
they want to be free. The feeling in
the interior of the island is more in
tense than along the coast. The Span
iards are not responsible for it because
they are migrating. --;' The , *__*__ there
do not like their old enemies, either."
NATIVES THIRST FOR
AMERICAN BLOOD
CHICAGO, March 10.â Tribune
will to-morrow print the following spe
cial correspondence from Porto Rico
from a Tribune correspondent:
SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO, March
_._The real situation in Porto Rico is
not understood. People in the States gen
erally regard Porto Rico as a sort of
haven of peace. The War Department
has just requested of General Henry that
he immediately report how many regular
troops he could spare from the island.
The One Hundred and Forty-seventh
New York started home last Sunday. The
regiments that remain are so scattered
that In many places where there is neces
sity for a strong force only a corporal's
guard can be mustered, and territories
where there are continual mutterlngs and
the greatest evidence of discontent at
American rule are unguarded.
General Henry is in a dilemma. He
has only three regiments of troopsâ the
Eleventh Infantry, the Nineteenth and
the Fifth Cavalryâ and two batteries of
the Fifth Heavy Artillery.
"I need twice the troops I have," said
the general at his residence in San Juan.
"Because, of the easy victory of our
troops here in the war and In the appar
ent friendliness of the natives to the
American soldiers when they invaded the
island, a notion prevails in the States that
there Is little necessity for a strong force
to maintain order in the island. The idea
is erroneous.
"Tift 1 conditions are alarming. These
people are now clamoring for local self
government. They are no more fit for
local self-government than I am to run
a locomotive. More troops are ( needed in
the island. The seeds of discontent plant
ed by professional agitators are rapidly
growing' and can be kept down only by a
strong military force.
"The 111 feeling between the natives and
the American troops' seems to grow
stronger every day. The American offi
cers have to maintain the greatest vigi
lance to prevent their men from wreak
ing vengeance on the natives, especially
on the native police, for acts of violence
that are continually committed against
the troops."
At Caguay, a small town on the mili
tary road twenty-live miles from San
Juan, a soldier of the One Hundred and
Forty-seventh New York was murdered
last Saturday night in a manner that
illustrates the treachery of the natives.
Private Michael Burke of Company I had
entered the Porto Rico Literary Club ot
Caguay and was sitting at a small table
reading, when a native slipped up behind
him and with one stroke of a machete,
sharpened to razor edge, severed the sol
dier's head from his body and sent It roll
ing across the floor.
Another soldier happened Into the club
some time afterward and saw the dis
membered trunk of the dead man still in
the chair, with the- head lying where it
had rolled. Several Porto Ricans were
standing quietly around discussing the
matter. No one would admit having
seen the murder committed. Suspicion
fixed on one man. but when a provost
guard went out to arrest him he had fled,
and although the entire country around
Caguay was thoroughly searched for the
murderer he has not yet been found.
Only four nights before the killing of
Burke the bad blood between the na
tives and soldiers asserted itself in a
brutal assault on Private Fitzpatrick.
The native police arrested Fitzpatrick
without a warrant, and when he resisted
beat him into Insensibility.
The soldiers. of the four companies of
the One hundred and forty-seventh sta
tioned at Caguay waited until night and
then started out to "police the town," as
they called It. Three cafes were "po-

Water Is Steadily Rising.
SHAWNEETOWN, 111.. March 10.â city is threatened with a flood
similar to that which almost swept the town away a year ago. The
residents are moving out as rapidly as possible 'and all the livestock
has been removed. The levee is thought to be weak in some places
and a break is liable to occur at any time. Many men are patrolling
the levee. Business is suspended and the citizens who remain are in con
stant fear of being swept away.
Last April the levee broke without warning. Twenty-five people were
â¢drowned and many residences and business houses destroyed. The town
has been practically rebuilt, and, should another flood occur, the loss would
be tremendous.

NEW YORK, March 10.â Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: Information has been
received by the State Department
showing that serious consideration is
being given by the Chinese Government
to a proposition to make San Mun a
free port. By this action China hopes
to checkmate Italy's plan for the seiz
ure of that port and the creation of a
sphere of influence in its immediate
vicinity.
Since China's refusal to cede the ter
ritory to Italy the Rome Government,
has not pressed its demand and in its
failure to act the authorities be
lieve they see evidence that Great Brit
ain and Japan haVe taken such meas
ures as to show Italy the inadvisability
of continuing her efforts to acquire
Chinese territory.
In throwing open San Mun to the
trade of the world China will take a
step which will be entirely satisfactory
to Great Britain and Japan and pleas
ing to the United States.
Because of the important effect which
the granting of the Italian demand
would have had on the partition of
China the United States authorities
have been closely following the devel
opments in the Far East, and they now
appear to be satisfied that in the face
of the opposition of Great Britain and
Japan Italy's request will not be grant
ed Italy did not make this move with
out consultation with the powers, and
she had good reasons to believe that
she would be supported by them, but
it is now evident they have considered
their promise fulfilled in supporting her
claim with diplomatic representations.
I was told to-day that the matter is
not being vigorously pressed by the
Italian Government, and It is not be
lieved it will be.
No information has been cabled to
the State Department by Minister Con
ger relative to the Niuchwang loan
crisis, because it apparently has had no
effect upon the affairs of this Govern
ment. The newspaper reports showing
that it has been settled, however, are
accepted. as true and both in adminis
tration and diplomatic circles an easier
feeling regarding the Far Eastern situ
ation is apparent.

LONDON, March 10.â The weekly
papers issued on Saturday will treat
China as the cardinal question. The
Spectator will say:
It is coming rapidly to thisâ Europe
must make serious agreements respecting
the spheres of influence In China with well
defined boundaries,* or the effort to pre
vent a general war will be a failure. We
regret the necessity, for we can fore
see the terrible strain on' the resources
of Great Britain, which are already
somewhat overtaxed, but we can perceive
no other way out of the impasse. Lord
Charles Beresford's policy of keeping the
open door by reviving China and so ob
taining a dominant Influence at Peking is
impossible. Corpses never revive.
The Speaker says:
We are â  primarily committed to the
open door and the maintenance of the in
tegrity of China. We are also partially
committed to' an approval of the system
of spheres of Influence which may disin
tegrate China. Must we not insist that
the policy of partition go no further until
the matter has been discussed in Euro
pean conference? Meanwhile it Is our
duty to civilization to defend free trade
by every means.
The Outlook, regarding partition of
some kind as inevitable, urges, before
trouble becomes irretrievable, the con
vening of a conference of the powers to
agree to broad principles on which the
partition of China may be pacifically
effected. It suggests that The Hague
conference put aside academic points
and deal with the greate3t menace to
peace, namely, the international scram
ble In China. Connecting the Muscat
incident with the Far Eastern question,
I the Outlook remarks:
Of the five powers who have estab
lished themselves territorially in China
only oneâ Englandâ has safeguarded "her
seaway thereto by strong places for sup
plies and repair. Until the others are sim
ilarly equipped they must be more or. less
at the mercy of England In the event of
war, which now seems Inevitable.

PRESIDENT
WILL FIGHT
TOM REED
Washington Politicians Say
That the War Is On
in Earnest.
THEY ALL DEPLORE IT
Will Be a Historic Battle, and
William McKinley Will Exert
All of His Strength.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 10.
The administration's contest against
Reed for re-election as Speaker is oc
cupying much space in the Eastern
press. It is likely to become historical,
and may have a most important bear
ing on the Presidential campaign next
year. Reed's jealousy of McKinley is
well known. It is of long standing and
appears to have become chronic.
In discussing this subject a leading
Republican to-day said: "I am sorry
that events have so shaped themselves
as to force the President to fight Reed.
Mr. Reed is of course a tough customer,
and he can make a great deal of
trouble, but Mr. McKinley has demon
strated that he is a pretty good poli
tician, and I am satisfied that he will
prove to be equal to the present emer
gency. Mr. Reed was given every op
portunity to adjust matters on. a satis
factory basis, but declined to avail him
self of it. That the administration can
defeat Reed for Speaker of the Fifty
sixth Congress is the conviction of the
great majority of conservative observ
ers. Some Western man will be picked
out for the administration forces to
rally around. It may be Henderson of
lowa, or Hopkins of Illin Is, or some
unknown man, but the decision is in
favor of a man from the West.
"There is method in this, of course.
The bulk of the Republican member
ship of the next House will be com
posed of Western men. They will be
in the majority and should, in the na
tural order of things, dominate the
House. It will be easier to defeat Reed
with a Western man than with Mr.
Sherman or any one from the Eastern
States.
"Mr. Reed can also continue his fight
against the administration from the
floor, but the President believes that if
Mr. Reed can be reduced to the ranks
in the House he will become more tract
able. Anything would be preferable, he
thinks, to his re-election as Speaker."
It is pointed out that Mr. Reed was
opposed to the annexation of Hawaii,
which the administration favored; that
he was at no time in sympathy with the
administration's Cuban policy; that he
opposed the acquisition < '. the Philip
pines and of Porto Rico, and was un
friendly to army reorganization on a
permanent basis; that he opposed the
Nicaragua canal, which is regarded as
essential to the development of the ex
pansion policy, and the Pacific cables,
being responsible for the defeat of both
schemes.
It is suggested that his opposition
thus disclosed to the general policy of
the administration will be almost cer
tain to hinder action if he is Speaker
of the next House, and that moreover,
his great power and prominence en
courage the development of an anti-
administration faction in the party
along almost the same lines of opposi
tion, save on the money question, as
those adopted by the followers of W.
J. Bryan â anti-expansion, anti-army,
anti-almost everything that the ad
ministration is for. Moreover, it is as
serted that even on the money question
Mr. Reed's plans differ from those of
the administration.
Notwithstanding the opposition to
Reed for political reasons, it is con
ceded that he is the biggest and brain
iest Republican alive, and it is probable
that when it comes to a show-down
many of those representatives who now
talk bravely of opposing him will fall
into Reed's lines as heretofore.

boast of Dan Burns, Major McLaughlin,

in vain did Burns, McLaughlin, Lind

with everything from the displeasure of

if they failed to vote to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was defeated on
Wednesday; in vain did they insist that
It was the pet measure of Governor Gage,
and that, as such, it should be supported
by every Republican vote in the Senate,
and in vain did they further debase them
selves by calling to mind their humiliat
ing experience of yesterday when they
crawled in the dust at the feet of the
Grant men and begged to be allowed to
dismiss the Gharges of contempt against
Milton J. Green. The result was in every
case the same. The Grant men scorned
the advances of those who had been will
ing to do a servile act after being beaten
into submission and because of prospec
tive gain; they had the Mexican down and
knew it, and knowing it, were not dis
posed to surrender the advantages of a
victory so hardly won. The other Repub
lican stalwarts, led by Senators Davis and
Boyce, ignored alike threats and offers of
personal gain, and showed the way to
success that marked Burns as a boss
without a following, a politician without
power.
Among those whose votes contributed to
the defeat of the measure on Wednesday
were Senators Hoey and Burnett. Both

Burns for Senator since the beginning of I
the session, and the fact that they broke
away from Burns and voted with the op
position on the Harbor Commission bill
caused great surprise and indignation in
the Burns camp. It was upon those two
men that the full strength of the Burns
batteries was turned last night and to-day
in an effort to pull them down and force
them against their convictions to vote to
reconsider the vote by which the hill was
defeated, or at least to vote to postpone
the consideration of the motion to recon
sider until some future time. Both Sen
ator Hoey and Senator Burnett, to their
credit be it said, refused to yield to either
threats or inducements of personal gain.
They had voted against the measure on
principle, and they declared their purpose
to continue to vote against it to the end.
That they carried out this declaration to
the letter was one of the bitterest drops
in the whole bitter dose forced down the
throats of the supporters of the bill this
afternoon.
The defeat of Burns and his followers I
was made more everwhelming by the fact |
that they made their fight not on the I
merits of the bill but upon a motion to
postpone action on the motion to recon- j
sider until Monday afternoon. Wednesday !
a majority of the Republican Senators I
and all of the Democrats put the stamp
of disapproval on the proposed measure
so far as Its merits were concerned. To
day the same majority put the seal of
their disapproval on Burns and his politi
cal machinations and pretensions. Hav
ing killed the bill, they wished to kill
Burns, and they did it so effectually that
there is no need of an autopsy to ascer
tain the cause of death. Should one
be held,- the verdict would be "overin
dulgence in political pretensions."
There were all kinds of lobby
ists on the floor when the bill ;
came up. It was not a good time |
for It. That every one of its friends was i
willing to admit; but there are certain I
restrictions to parliamentary proceedings I
and one of them is that when a Senator
gives notice that on a certain day he will i
move to reconsider a certain vote he must '
.make his motion or let his intention to I
reconsider pass from sight. It was a case j
of Hobson's choice, and Dickinson made !
his motion just after the time for the i
consideration of the Assembly file had j
expired.
In making his motion, he said, he had
one or two amendments to offer to the
schedule of salaries as set forth in me
bill, and he thought Monday was none
too soon to bring them up for considera
tion. Wolfe put the motion in definite
shape by moving that the matter go over
until Monday at half-past 3, and all the
supporters of the bill seconded the mo
tion.
Davis objected. He said the Senator
from Marin had asked that the question
go over from yesterday afternoon until
to-day on the ground that he desired a
full attendance of the Senate, and Sena
tor Davis called attention to the fact that
the Senators were present in numbers as
great as ever could be expected.
Continuing, Davis said: "I withdrew
my objection to a postponement from yes
terday purely out of courtesy. I ex
pected the measure to come up for con
sideration to-day, and so did everybody
else. We have all the afternoon and all
the evening to consider the matter, and
there is no need to put it off any longr.
We can reconsider the vote and consider
the bill, or we can vote it down and finish
it, but there Is no reason to postpone it."
Davis declared the bill was illogical
upon the showing of the author himself.
He called attention to the report of the
investigating committee and to the fact
that it charged corruption in the manage
ment of harbor affairs. He calleC atten
tion to the fact that two members of the
board were, by the terms of the bill, re
tained In office, and the third would be i
out of office, by the expiration of his
term, in two weeks. Both members re
tained must be honest, Davis said, or they
would not be retained, and within two
weeks the Governor would appoint a
third, also honest, and so all the Investi
gating committee could ask would have
been granted and so what was the use of
the bill?
"If there be corruption to correct," de
manded Davis, "why retain two of the
corruptionists in office? On behalf of the
Republican party, its heart and soul, its
rank and file, let us stand by our prin
ciples In spite of the temptation to use
the powers which have been given us and i
we will be doing higher politics than if j
we pass this bill.''
Then Leavitt had something to "say.
Measure after measure, he declared, had
come up, and had been laid over merely
as a matter of courtesy to the Senator
who moved to postpone. It was a Sena
torial courtesy, he said, and he proceeded
to dilate on that ethereal thing which al
lows all that the rules forbid and sanc
tions much that is unparliamentary. He
said he would like to answer Davis, "the
Senator from Amador," but he would not
do so on a motion to postpone. He would
wait until the bill came up for final pas
â¢ sage, an Intention somewhat premature
ana optimistic. _ _ _
Boyce was the next man who had some
thing to say, but his remarks did no good
to the bill. "We have been on watch all
day," he said; "we have been waiting for
this bill to come up and we propose to
put It in a coffin and screw down the lid
so this corpse will never rise again. '
Luchsinger said he would vote for
postponement out of Senatorial courtesy.
Wolfe added a few words on the same j
subject of courtesy and then proceeded J
Ito do politics. He gloried In the Demo-
I crats standing solidly together and, al
though he did not say so. it was plain
â  he did not glory in the Republicans. He
j said Davis got his applause from the
Democrats "and he was entitled to it.''
and he declared the motion should be
postponed.
Ashe wanted to know if Wolfe consid
ered it a political fight, but Wolfe pre
ferred to remain silent, on that phase of
the question, and then Flint, who was
not presiding, raised the point of order
that the merits of the bill could not be
discussed on. a motion to postpone.
Dickinson spoke again, explaining his
Intention: to amend If the bill was re
considered, and then it went to a vote.

HOEY WIELDS THE GAVEL
WITH MARVELOUS EFFECT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 10.â Assemblyman Law
rence Hoey of San Francisco was in the
chair this evening in the absence of
Speaker Anderson. The claims of most of
the newspapers of the State for the publi
cation of constutitlonal amendments were
the special order for the evening. All but
three of them were passed. The three
went over on the unfinished business file.
Mr. Hoey'_ troubles began when he
banged the gavel for order. Some one had
put a handful of parlor matches on the
block beneath it, and after the smoke had
cleared away he sent a page behind the
chair to hunt for his mallet.
"The House will come to order and the
clerk will read the title," said Mr. Hoey.
"What title?" asked Mr. Belshaw.
"To the bill." said Hoey.
"What hill?" Inquired Dibble.
"Any bill." yelled Hoey, and the clerk
picked up the file.
Then Belshaw respectfully called at
tention to the fact that Crowley of San
Francisco was smoking a cigarette
against rule 69.
"I don't see him doing it," said Hoey.
"The sergeant at arms will put Mr. Bel
shaw in his seat."
Down came the gavel and off went an
other bunch of matches and work was
resumed on the file.
Despite the "joshing," Hoey proved an
excellent Speaker. He got through with
an enormous amount of work, and dealt
without a shudder on points of parlia
mentary law that even Dibble would not
have dared dally with.
In a ringing, appreciative speech on be
half of the San Francisco delegation Dib
ble passed up to the desk one of the finest
things in the gold brick line that has been
handed out during the session. Hoey de
clared that "gold bricks being out of or
der we will proceed with the file," and
the fun was over for the evening.
The day session was consumed in the
final consideration of the "fender" and
"Santa Fe" bills, and no other measures
were passed.

AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES
CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 10.â After a hard fight
Senator Curtin secured the passage of his
bill relating to agricultural societies, this
evening. It is the same bill that has been
brought up in various forms by different
Senators in the last two or three sessions,
and has never before reached so much as
a favorable vote.
The bill provides a means by which ag
ricultural societies may test their claims
for compensation for money spent on im
provements out of their own appropria
tions. In Tuolumne the directors of the
fair in that district have expeneded toOOO
in improvements on the understanding
that the State would pay certain other ex
penses of the fair, principal among which
was the money given in prizes. The fair
grounds in Tuolumne County were pur
chased in 1889, and in that year, 1891 and
1893 the State allowed the prize money,

The gate receipts for each year have
reduced the total of the Indebtedness to
about $2000, and this is the amount of the
debt which now lies upon the association.
In 1895 and 1897, however. Governor Budd
vetoed the claims for prize money, and
that left the association so much behind.
Curtin's bill makes no appropriation. It
only places the claims in such a position
that at any time the agricultural district
may make a claim for money expended on
agricultural fair grounds which are the
property of the State and then test the
claims before the Board of Examiners.
Should the Board of Examiners pass the
claims under the act just passed by the
Senate it will establish them as just
claims: if the board refuses them it. will
allow the bringing to suit and the testing
of the claims in a court of law. where
they may be finally settled. There was
a good deal of active opposition to the
bill, but after some time spent in argu
ment by Its author it was passed.
JOHNSON AGAIN TRIES TO
FORCE AN ADJOURNMENT
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 10.â Grove L. Johnson
this morning made another abortive at
tempt to adjourn the Legislature sine die
by moving to recall from the table Bel
shaw's resolution to adjourn sine die on
the 11th. : The .Burns push had not
reached the chamber and only a few
scattering Votes were cast in favor of his
motion. t.
The lack of unanimity of feeling In fa
vor of his proposition angered Johnson
and he indulged in one of his little nerve
grating harangues. in which he poked fun
at the House and declared frankly that
now that pay was stopped he did not
care to work any longer. He made the
happy admission that he was here for the
dollars solely and not for the benefit he
might be to California's dilapidate
codes.
"You gentlemen may like to v work with
out pay," said he. "I suppose you do
and you have got a right. But I don't.
I do not see why I should stay here day
after day and get. nothing for it.

propriation bill will only take an hour or
so and the tax levy not much longer.
We could get everything done and I want
to recall Belshaw's resolution from the
table and amend it for the 15th."
Â» Valentine and Dibble ridiculed the
statement that business could be dis
posed of and adjournment taken by the
15th. They laughed at Johnson's idea of
getting through with the general appro
priation bill and tax levy in three or four
hours. , _
Valentine said adjournment before the
ISth was a physical impossibility and pos
sibly it could not be taken on that day.
The question was called for and John

feated.

Hints of the "Colonel's" Withdrawal
From the Senatorial Contest
in Circulation at
the Capital.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 10.â In the Senate to-day
the Burns forces were defeated and hu
miliated. The touts, big and little, sought
to secure a reconsideration of the bill to
reorganize the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners, but the friends of the
people on the floor of the Senate stood
together manfully and effectually disposed
of the scheme.
The engagement had a bearing on the
Senatorial contest for this reason: Prom
ises were made right and left that the
supporters of Dan Burns should be re
warded with the official spoils of the party
to which he claims to belong. There were
not enough offices in sight to meet the
demand of the touts for places at the
public crib; hence attention was turned
to the scheme to reorganize the Harbor
Commission. The bill proposed to oust
200 employes from office and give the
patronage, aggregating #2so,ooo per annum,
to the touts.
The Grant men saw the danger in the
proposition, and did not propose to be
caught napping or be misled by the cry
that to the victors belong the spoils. They
believed the pretense that places were to
be filled by loyal and faithful Republicans
independent of Senatorial considerations
was a fraud and a sham.
Diligent Inquiry and common-sense in
duced them to believe that Burns was in
a desperate strait for help and that the |
success of the bill would give him an op
portunity to promise 200 places. Beyond
that the Grant men were convinced that
the passage of the measure would be
regarded as a Burns triumph and the
people of the State were not in a frame of
mind to justify legislation favorable to
the Senatorial aspirations of Burns.
The monotony of the Senatorial situa
tion was not broken by the joint ballot
to-day, but it was gratifying to note that
one hundred and twelve members of the
Legislature responded to the rollcall. The
number required for a choice was fifty
seven. Considering that the members are
working without pay, the attendance is
very good. There are no indications that
the number will be diminished next week.
In fact the supporters of General Barnes
and Mr. Grant are receiving commenda
tory letters and telegrams from constitu
ents urging them to remain at their post
of duty to defeat the election of Burns.
To-day one member who Is voting for
Barnes was assured that the people of his '
district would not allow his pay to stop I
because the State had ceased paying tne i
legislators. The message said; "In op- i
posing the election of an unworthy man |
and advocating the cause of a clean and
able candidate you are working for tne
people, w ho will manifest their apprecia- '
tion of your services."
Inquiries at the various Senatorial i
camps to-night do not foreshadow Im
portant changes to-morrow, but It is be
lieved, nevertheless, that accessions to the
Barnes column will soon be recorded. His
supporters are confident and enthusiastic.
The Grant men are displaying fresh signs
of courage, and are naturally elated over
the defeat of the "organization" in the
Senate to-day.
The Burns men, with the aid oi the
Democrats, may attempt to force an ad
journment sine die at an earlier date than
Saturday of next week, but such an at
tempt will provoke a bitter controversy.
" There is no caucus talk to-night. Had
Burns succeeded in his legislative
schemes he might have started in anew
to agitate the calling of a caucus, but the
defeat In the Senate to-day has stunned !
the managers of the "Colonel's" fight.
Everybody says there will be "something
doing next week," but it Is the general
opinion that few important movements
will be made In the open before Monday
next.
The surmises pertaining to the events of
next week are varied and conflicting. Men
whose opinions are entitled to respect ex
press the view that Burns will withdraw
from the contest in order that a Repub
lican Senator may be chosen at this ses- |
sion. Others entertain the opinion that
Burns is too selfish and bitter to make
any concessions for the sake of the Re- |
publican party, and that he will use all j
the means within his reach to defeat the
election of anybody but himself. ThÂ« j
anti-Burns Republicans in the Legislature
may take the subject in hand and elect
despite the programme of "Burns or no
Senator."
The Southern Pacific is sharply criti
cized for its brazen attempt to force the
election of Burns, contrary to the ex
pressed will of a majority of the Repub
lican members of the Legislature. It Is
the comment that the corporation should
now retire from the contest and permit
the representatives of .the people to set
tle the Senatorial question in their own
way. ;-'._

getting tired of lobbyists and Senators
who lay aside their dignity for the pur
pose of securing another vote for a fa-
vorlte measure. He took his first step
toward their suppression by submitting
the following resolution:
Whereas, The exhibition on the floor of this
Senate on Thursday, March 9, during the roll
call on Senate bill 367, was not calculated ' to
promote deliberate and free action on the part
of Senators upon pending legislation; now,
therefore, be it
Resolved. That while this body Is taking ac
tion upon pending measures and during the
roll call thereon, no Senator, member of the
Assembly or other person shall solicit any
member of this body to vote in any particular
way, or induce or attempt to induce, any mem
ber of this body to vote or change his vote
upon the same, nor attempt by private argu
ment or solicitation to affect the action of this
body or members thereof.
Senator Rowell Is responsible for Senate
bill 367. It Is a measure defining terms
when used in connection with assessable
property, and there was much opposition
to that clause relating to money depos
ited in banks and making such money
taxable as part of the property of the
bank or corporation. When the hill came
up there was not much said, but by the
time the roll had been called several Sen
ators had left their seats and were rush
ing from desk to desk, while changes
from "aye" to "no" began to be heard.
It was finally announced from the chair

SENATE STILL JUMPING
ON THE NEWSPAPERS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 10.â Senate bill 530, which
provides that newspaper articles of a cer
tain kind shall be signed, came up before
the Senate this evening, and was made
more emphatic by a vote refusing to re
consider the vote by which it was passed
yesterday.
The motion to reconsider was made by
Senator Smith, who, in moving to take
the matter up again, made another plea
for the . rights of a newspaper and the
general responsibility which has always
characterized it and which has made it a
power in the land. To make of the news
paper but a collection of signed articles
was, In his judgment, to rob it of the
element which has made it what it is,
and he declared that the bill should not
only be reconsidered but defeated.
Shortridge backed him up in his state
ments and then added a few of his own.
He said the law Was a dead letter any
how, and would never amount to any
thing, besides being vicious anad danger
ous legislation and a blow at the guaran
teed liberty of the press.
Gillette, who had voted for the bill, fa
vored a reconsideration because, he said,
he had discovered that the bill allowed
suit for omission of the signature to be
brought by any one and half of the fine
would go to the patriotic citizen who had
the nerve to bring the suit. It mattered
little whether the plaintiff was the one re
ferred to in the article; any one could
bring suit and half the money was his if
it turned out successful.
He thought the bill was loosely drawn
In that respect and so he said he would
vote to reconsider. The final vote on re

SANTA FE BILL
IS NOW IN THE
GOVERNOR'S HANDS
Passes the Assembly, After a . Hard
Fight, With Only Twelve Votes
Recorded Against It.
ACTUAL COMPETITION IS ASSURED
Southern Pacific's Great Bival Enabled to
Consolidate Its Interests in This State
and Carry Out Its Purpose.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 10.â Senate bill 27. by
Simpson, went through the Assembly
on its final passage this afternoon, with
only twelve votes against it.
It gave rise to the first redhot debate
that has occurred over any bill during
the present session. For a matter of
two hours or more there was some
mighty spell binding. Caminetti of
Amador made most of the noise; Dib
ble and Johnson did most of the work.
The measure before the House was
the much-discussed Santa Fe bill. It
permits the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe people to acquire the 'Federal
franchise of the old Atlantic and Pa
cific road between Mojave and the
Needles, the Southern California Rail
way from Barstow to Los Angeles, the
right of way over the Southern Pa
cific's line from Mojave to Bakersfleld
and the San Joaquin Valley road from
Bakersfleld to San Francisco. All of
these franchises and rights of way the
road needs, that it may bring into San \
Francisco the first competing line that
has come to California's relief.
When the bill came up as a special
order for this afternoon Caminetti
opened the proceedings by calling up
his substitute bill, which was already
printed in the journal."*
Judge Dibble asked him to explain
before further action "was taken just
what his substitute was designed to
effect. Caminetti explained. It took
him just sixty-six minutes, but he ex
plained.
"In the first place," said he. "nothing
but the stock of the California rail
roads is permitted to be sold by the
provisions of my amendment. The
franchises and rights of way cannot
be transferred. In other words, the
buyer becomes a stockholder rather
than an owner.
"In the second place, bill 57 says in
one clause that no competing road may
be bought by its competitor. Thai's all
right as far as it goes, but the next
section nullifies it by providing that
any line now leased, competitive or
otherwise, may be purchased.
"What I fear, and the reason for my
amendment is, that in passing bill No.
57 you take from California the right
to revise or repeal these franchises by
transferring them to a foreign corpora
tion."
Then Mr. Caminetti opened out. For
over an hour he contended with much
eloquence that the bill was no more nor
less than a scheme to assist the South
ern Pacific to destroy possible compe
tition by amalgamating the new line
with its own. True competition, he
said, was practically an impossibility.
Judge Dibble pulled the constitution
on Caminetti and proved to the satis
faction of more than enough of the
members to pass the bill that Senate
bill 57 provided none of the fearful
things the gentleman from Amador
claimed it did, and after < a brilliant
speech in favor of the measure gave
way to Grove Johnson, who, in his own
meek way, told Mr. Caminetti he was
playing to the gallery.
Then a vote was taken on Caminetti's
substitution and it went down, 56 to 14.
The question was then on the final
passage of the original bill. Caminetti
jumped in with more -amendments, and
Dibble threatened to head him off with
a demand for the previous question if
he persisted in dilatory tactics.
"Choke me off!" yelled Caminetti.
"But answer to the people for what
you have done!"
Then Grove Johnson got up again and
delivered a telling speech.
"If I did not know the gentleman
from Amador as well as I do. if 1 did
not know his reputation for honesty
and integrity in all things, I should be
led to believe by his action here to
day that he was doing railroad politics:
that he was opposed to the Santa Fe
people in their endeavor to bring a
competing line into California to for
ever relieve her of the one road domi

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- j
MENTO, March in.â Assemblyman Grove
L. Johnson is at it again. This time the
facts, as far as they are known, seem to
Indicate that while he is a member of the
Legislature he is still attending to the de
tails of his law business and that he Is
making one occupation assist the other to
their mutual advantage.
On February 17 Mr. Johnson Introduced
In the Assembly a bill entitled "An act
to amend section 1880 of the Code of Civil
Proceedure. relating to witnesses." It
Is in the provisions of this bill that Mr.
Johnson's fine legal hand appears.
By some legislative process known to
those who are familiar with the by-paths
of legislation as it is enacted in the Cali
fornia Legislature, Mr. Johnson secured a
favorable recommendation for the bill by
the Assembly Judiciary Committee and
then secured its passage by the Assembly
without attracting to it the attention of
the several lawyers who are members of
that body.
It was then transmitted to the Senate.
where ft was referred to the Judiciary
Committee of that body, and but for the
discovery made to-day It is more than
probable that it would have received the
Fame consideration at the hands of the
upper house of the Legislature that it did
in the Assembly. As it is. there must be
an counting rendered by Mr. Johnson,
and that right speedily. ' - .
The bill, which is. short, reads as fol
lows:
Section Iâ Section eighteen hundred and
eighty is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section ISSOâ The following persons cannot be
" ?: , _ ._
1. Those who are of unsound mind at the
time of their action for examination.
2 Children under Id year. of age who ap

the facts respecting which they are examined,
or of relating them truly.
3 Parties or assignors of parties to an ac
tlon or proceeding;, or persons in whose behalf
an action or proceeding is prosecuted against
an executor or administrator, upon a claim
or demand against the estate of a -deceased
person as to any matter of fact, occurring be
fore trie death of such deceased person.
Provided, that such persons or
parties become fully competent if re
quired by the executor or administra
tor to testify or be sworn in the
action as to such matters, either on
the trial or by deposition.
Sec. 2. This amendment shall take

CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.
The Children Will Dance Around the
Maypole and Follow the Pied

Prompted by the great success of the
entertainment given at the Hobart man
sion a few weeks ago and in response to
numerous petitions- for a repetition, the
lady patronesses of the Children's Hos
pital and Training School for Nurses have
decided to repeat the "Mother Goose" en
tertainment this afternoon at Native
Sons' Hall. .
The entertainment promises. In many
ways to exceed in artistic merit and ef
fect the delightful affair at the Hobart
home. The limited stage accommodations
of the Van Ness avenue residence pre
vented many of those in attendance from
unloving the beautiful tableaux, in which
the tin y belles and beaux were so pret
tily posed-a drawback to complete suc

Aether feature in favor of the.enter

there will be no booths and that the

Presided over their destinies will join tne
children on the stage in the songs and

addition to the existing law. Attention is
also directed to the enacting clause which
â  makes the law as amended by Mr. John
son take effect immediately, and also
makes it applicable to all eases now pend
ing in the courts.
Mr. Johnson has two cases pending In
court which would be materially affected
by the new law. So much so. in fact, that
Mr. Johnson would probably be enabled
to win a decision should the bill become
a law. , 'â¢
Mr. Johnson is attorney for the plain
j tiff in a suit now pending against the
Murdock estate. The suit is for $100,000.
j The details are not at hand to-night, but
â¢it Is said that Mr.' Johnson's proposed
I amendment is in keeping with the neces
sities of the case as viewed from his
standpoint.
Mr. Johnson is also the attorney for the
plaintiff in the case of Amanda Austin vs.
George Wilcoxson, executor of the es
tate of Jefferson Wilcoxson, deceased.
The action is for $150,000 alleged to be due
the plaintiff for services as nurse and
housekeeper for Jefferson Wilcoxson dur
ing a period of eighteen years. Roughly
estimated the plaintiff estimates her ser
vices to Wilcoxson as being worth about
Sent a month during the term of her al
leged services.
Under the present law Johnson can call
the plaintiff as a witness and examine her
as to all of the facts relating to her
claim as have occurred since the death
of her former â  employer but cannot go
back to a time anterior to such death.
Should the condition of the case make it
necessary in order to make a proper de
fense for the attorneys for the defendant
to call the plaintiff as a witness Mr. John
son would, under the provisions of the
proposed law, be entitled to go back to
the time of the plaintiff's employment by
the deceased, because the witness had
been called by the executor.
It will at once be apparent to all law
yers' that this amendment to what has al
ways been considered as one of the wisest
provisions safeguarding the rights of a
deceased person will work incalculable
harm if it becomes a law. If It be true.
as alleged, that by the passage of the bill
Mr Johnson seeks to gain an advantage
in two lawsuits -in which he is interested

of money and both based on apparently

FELL FROM THE DECK
INTO AN ANGRY SEA
W. LOWMAN DROWNED FROM
THE SHIP S. N. CASTLE.
Was Returning From an Ocean Trip
Made to Regain His
Health.
The ship S. N. Castle, which arrived In
' port late last night from Honolulu,
| brought the sad tidings of the drowning
! of L. Lowman. a passenger, who was.
making a trip for his health.
The accident occurred last Friday in
! longitude (150.35 west, latitude 34.11 north.
The vessel had been lying to for about two
â  days in a dead calm.- Thursday afternoon
I a breeze sprang up and the vessel again
i got under way. Friday morning the
! breeze was so strong that it was found
necessary to shorten sail. The sea was
boisterous and the vessel was rolling
! heavily. Mr. Lowman strolled on deck
and stopped at the after companion way
to talk to C. F. Merrill, a fellow passen
ger. A sudden lurch of the vessel caused
I him to stop back several steps in an ef
i fort to gain his balance. He struck the
rail and to], pied over it into the sea. Mr.
| Merrill at once sprang for the lifebuoy
! and threw it over to the struggling man,
who was fast being left astern. Captain
Hubbard was at the wheel at the time
I and at "once brought the vessel to and or
â¢ dered the small boat to be lowered.
A diligent search was kept up for over
an hour by the men in the boat, who were
' in imminent danger of losing their lives
owing to the heavy sea. Nothing was
found but the lifebuoy, and the boat final
ly returned to- the ship.
It is thought that Mr. Lowman was un
able to swim, as the buoy thrown by Mr.
' Merrill struck within a few feet of him.
He was about 40 years of age, unmarried,
| and resided at Los Angeles.

MB. MORELAND'S SUCCESSOR. j
! Rev. David Claiborne Garrett of
Portland Will Fill St.
: 0J; Luke's Pulpit.
Rev. David Claiborne Garrett of St.
: Mark's Church, Portland, Or., has ac
j cepted the pulpit of St. .Luke's Church
In this city, vacated by the elevation of
! Rev. TV. H.'Moreland to the bishopric
i of Sacramento.
. Mr.' Garrett was born in Burlington,
I lowa, December 23, 1850. He was edu
cated in the public schools of Burlington
and in.Griswdld College, Davenport. He
afterward went to Harvard University,
where he received the degree of A. B. in
1592. His first . pastorage was Trinity
Church of Davenport, where he built lip
the parish from a small congregation to
a large and flourlsh-ng church, clearing
off all indebtedness, erecting a rectory
[ and doubling the number of CQimnuni
-1 cants.
In 1890 Mr. Garrett received a call to'
St Mark's Church. Seattle, a newly or
ganized parish. After visiting the field
THE SATS FRANCISCO CAI/L, SATURDAY, MARCH 11, 1899.
he felt it his duty to accept and there
repeated the experience of the seven
years of his- rectorship in Davenport.
Within a year the church was enlarged
three times and a handsome rectory
built. Mr: Garrett remained through all
the hard times, declining numerous calls
to higher parishes. â¢
After three years he was called to go
back to his old parish in Davenport, and
also in Christ's Cathedral, New Orleans.
In 1896 he was elected rector of Trinity
Church, Portland, but felt obliged to de
cline that. The next spring through his
efforts the handsome new St.. Mark
Church was erected. Then Trinity Church
of Portland sent a second call and Mr.
Garrett, considering his work in Seattle
completed, went to Portland.
' During his rectorship in Portland the
congregation increased to such an extent
that the vestry is now planning to put
pews in the gallery. It was largely
through his influence that a debt of $40,000
has been virtually raised by the sale of
bonds to the church members. Mr. Gar
rett was married in 1883 to Miss Lily
Selmes of Boston and has three children.

LEAF TOBACCO TAX
FULLY EXPLAINED
INTEBNAL BEVENUE COMMIS-
SIONEB'S BULING.
Dealers Have No Excuse for Disre
garding the Law and It Will
Be Enforced.
On February 20 Collector John C. Lynch
prepared a very full statement of the con
dition of the trade In leaf tobacco and
forwarded It to the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue,- requesting answers to the
different questions that seemed in doubt.
In answer to this letter the Commissioner
has given full information as follows:
Dealers in leaf tobacco will not be permitted
| to sell leaf tobacco In quantities less than a
i hogshead, case or bale. Neither will they be
permitted to sell directly" to consumers, and
they will be required to confine their sales to
! three classes of purchasers, namely:
Firstâ To other registered dealers in leaf to
hacco. â¢_*â â "; _
Secondâ To duly registered manufacturers of
: tobacco, snuff or cigars.
!* Thirdâ persons who purchase leaf tobacco
! in packages for export:
Dealers in leaf tobacco selling to other per
sons or in any manner than - as above
will be regarded as manufacturers of tobacco,
1 and all tobacco so sold by them will be re
' garded as manufactured tobacco and liable for
the tax of 12 cents per pound. .
-v qualified manufacturer of tobacco has the
rignt to sell leaf tobacco to other manufac
! turers of tobacco or clears in quantities less
! than a hogshead, case or bale. ,__._.
Dealers in leaf tobacco have the ri_nt_ to
qualify as manufacturers of tobacco, but
' should keep their business as leaf dealers
I separated from that as manufacturers.
Leaf tobacco sold by a manufacturer of to
bacco directly to consumers or to persons
other than duly registered manufacturers of
; tobacco or cigars is regarded to be a manufac
turer of tobacco subject to tax.
The Commissioner further says that the
permits required for retaining leaf to
bacco may be given at the end of the
month for all tobacco sold during the
month, but this is to be done under su
pervision of the Collector and must be
verified by a deputy. Finally, the Com
missioner adds that his "office notes with
satisfaction that you state there la no re
tailing done In your district in the sense
of direct sales from leaf -dealers to con
sumers." This is a' point on which the
Revenue Department will strictly enforce
the law. These decisions are given by
Hon George W. Wilson.' the newly ap
pointed Commissioner of Internal Reve
nue Mr. Wilson has been connected with
the' Revenue Department for many years
and Is thoroughly conversant with the
whole body of the revenue laws and
equally with the requirements of the
trades that these laws affect. Collector
Lynch and Revenue Agent Thomas be
lieve that the trade is sufficiently pro
tected by these rulings, and that the leaf
dealers especially have every cause -to be
grateful to the department for the very
liberal construction put upon the act of
August 28. 1804. which, If taken literally.
absolutely prohibits the sale of any small
quantity of leaf tobacco.
LIFE-SAVING STATION
FOR POINT BOMTA
BIDS WILL BE OPENED ON NEXT.

The Necessity for Such a Station Has
* at Last Been Made Obvious.
Work Will Begin
Soon.
Bids for the construction of the life
saving station at Point Bonlta will be
opened at the office of the general super
intendent of the Life-saving Service,
Treasury Department, Washington, D. C,
at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of March 14.
The construction of a life-saving sta
tion at this point will . provide a long

Marine men for years have looked upon
this promontory as dangerous, and com
plaint after complaint has been sent to
Washington without effect until recently.
The specifications call for a two-story
building of brick for the accommodation
of the keeper and crew; also a lookout
tower, an inside boathouse, an outside
boathouse, an outbuilding for storage and
a flagstaff and a drillpole. The inside
boathouse will he located near the point
on the Golden Gate side, and the lookout
on the old lighthouse site. The dwelling
Is to be on the coast about 500 yards from
the inner boathouse. The outside boat
house will be located on the north side.
A number of local contractors have for
warded bids.
A NEW FERRY LINE.
Oakland Syndicate to Build it With-
out the Santa Fe's Aid.
I The Oakland Consolidated Street Rail-
I road Companies have perfected plans to
operate a ferry service, between this city,
Oakland,. Berkeley and Alameda. Al
though the corporation will not have
the support of the Santa Fe
lbie nor of the English capital
ists who were expected to go into the
deal, ' Millionaire Smith, who is at the
head* of the proposed service, is said to
have secured enough money to put it in
operation in connection with the local
lines of the four cities. This will neces
sitate the building of three ferry boats
and the changing of the electric road
cars to passenger coaches.
Large property-owners on the other
side of the bay are dissatisfied with the
new arrangement inaugurated at the
mole by the Southern Pacific Company. It
is the general opinion that the system is
calculated to injure traffic with the sub
urban towns by reason, of the discom
forts attached to travel over the regular
routes. . - ' - xVo-:";;,:

"I find many changes in Washington,"
said he, "but the greatest and most dis
graceful change is that which has taken
place in Meridian Hill. Now, when I lived
on that hill It was a magnificent place. I
built my cabin there because it was the

Locomotive Boiler Explodes.
DENVER. Colo., March 11.â A Denver
and Rio â¢ Grande engine blew up at the
crossing of the Rio Grande and Santa Fe
tracks south of town about midnight. En
gineer White and Fireman Harvey Payne
were badly scalded. The head brakeman,
because it accomplishes in every instance
exactly what is claimed for it.
And of what other remedy can that be
said ?
Every form of nervous trouble, wheth-
er localized In the muscles,- heart,
brain, or in the nerves themselves, is
cured to stay curedâ by Paine's celery
compound. Every kind and degree of im-
poverishment of the system is overcome
by this greatest of all invigorators after
other remedies have shown no beneficial
effect.
It is the spring remedy vouched for by
physicians, teachers and well read,- well
informed men and women in every part
of the country.
People are everywhere dying of exhaust-
ed nervous energy or dragging out their
lives in pain and discomfort because of
sleeplessness, nervousness and fagged-out
brains! The objective point of Paine's
celery compound .in successfully curing
such nervous troubles is to feed the"
nerves, build up^-he wasted brain parts,
nourish the tissues and increase the con-
structive capacity of the blood. Health
and renewed life to. all the nervous tis-
sues thus takes the place of the lethargy
and the debility of disease, when Paine's
whose name cannot now be learned, was
seriously hurt. The engine was pulling a
stock train and slipped off the track. It
is thought the explosion was caused by
the jar.

Paine's celery compound .only by hear-

mind grow clear. By means of this great
modern remedy the liver that has been

bilious attacks and the poisonous head-

If it were possible to make a house-to-

Sonoma County's Sheriff, After a
Long Chase, Runs Down

derer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, March 10.â The long
search of Sheriff Frank P. Grace for
George Laymance, who last December
murdered Dr. Kartell at Healdsburg,
has ended. Grace telegraphed to the
Sheriffs office here this afternoon from
Missouri that he had captured his man*
and would arrive with him next week.
The telegram was as follows: '..':,
NORTH SPRINGFIELD, Mo., March 10.
To J. S. Austin, Under Sheriff, Santa
Rosa, Cal.: Arrested Laymance thirty
miles south of Fort Smith hint night on
line between Arkansas and Indian Terri
tory- Will be home in eight days. â 
FRANK P. GRACE. .
The crime for which Laymance must
answer was committed before Sheriff
Grace's term of office commenced. Lay
mance had been drinking and upon
coming out of a saloon in Healdsburg
was met by his wife, who- implored him
to come home. Laymance at once be
gan to abuse her, and, according- to
statements made by witnesses, at
tempted to strike her. Dr. Kartell, a
retired German physician, remonstrated
and Laymance whipped out a Â«kiiife and
disemboweled him on the spot. Lay
mance then disappeared. Kartell, after
lingering in agony for almost two
weeks, passed away.
Kartell's death occurred only a few
days after Sheriff Grace's term com
menced. Grace and his deputies at
once began a search for the murderer.
Two weeks ago a letter in Laymance's
handwriting was received at the Post
office in Oakland, and by a rare piece
of luck was recognized. The letter had
been posted at a .ail tow in Arkan
sas. Grace was notified and at once
set out in another effort to find the
man. Arriving in the Arkansas town
he found Laymance gone, but* the fugi
tive had left a clew and after chasing
him for over a week through all kinds
of country he located him late last
night and placed him under arrest.

A CHINESE OPIUM
SMUGGLER CONFESSES
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, March 10.â
Another scheme for smuggling opium Into
the prison was nipped ln the bud by War
den Hale yesterday. The plot was dis
covered through the confession of a Chi
nese who used "dope" consigned to other
prisoners and consequently ' got into
trouble.
Ah Pue is a Chinese convict who does ]
the housework for Secretary Joseph El- |
lis. Forsome time he has acted as the' â 
medium between the users of the drug
and the "outside men." The opium would
be cached at night in the rear of Ellis' !
house and Pue would send it into the
prison wrapped ifi. soiled linen Intended
for the laundry.
Of late the wily Chinese has been in the
habit of using the opium himself. For
this a convict named Williams; serving
five years for a burglary committed in
San Francisco, threatened to kill Ah Pue.
The Mongolian became frightened and
finally confessed to Warden Hale that he
had been smuggling the contraband ar
ticle Into the prison. Williams at first
denied the charge, but at length admitted
his guilt and was thrown into the dun
geon to await the action of the Board of j
State Prison Directors to-morrow.

GERMAN CONSUL
ROSE DEFENDS HIS
ACTION AT APIA
Attributes the Trouble to the
Attitude of British and
Americans.
BERLIN, March 10.â The Reichzanger
published a series of . official dispatches
from Samoa, Herr Rose, the German
Consul, in his report of .the events prior
to January 4, dated January 23, says the
decision of Chief Justice Chambers in fa
vor of Malietoa Tanu was- bound to have
a stupefying effect, inasmuch as in a
written statement dated October 5, 1595,
Mr. Chambers declared there was no
ground for contesting Mataafa's assump
tion of the sovereignty if he were 'elected
King. During the course of the discus
sion prior to the outbreak respecting the
measures to be adopted to assure public
security, Mr. Maxse, the British Consul,
and Captain Sturdee.ofthe British cruiser
Porpoise, are reported to have intimated
their intention to forcibly prevent any ad
vance of the Mataafans and -to actively
protect the Tanuites. While' the Germans
only announced such military j measures
as were prompted by the necessity to
protect the lives and property of the
whites, the British guards stationed a
Mr. Chambers' residence would, owing to
the locality, have been drawn directly
into conflict with the natives.
Herr Rose then relates how he rode on
the afternoon of January 1 to the Tivoli j
Hotel in order, like many whites, to
watch, events, and how on his way there
he had to traverse a body of Mataafans,
to whom, however, he did not speak.
Shortly after 4 o'clock, the German Con
sul .continues, he rode with Lieutenant
Krelinghaus of the German- warship Falke
to Songi and home again. Thus, the Con
sul concludes, Mr. Chambers' accusation
that, he rode at the head of a troop of.
Mataafans' at 4:30, when they attacked
the Tivoli Hotel, is "pure invention," as
proved by the written testimony of Lieu- j
tenant Freiinghaus'. The Consul adds
that the first two. shots were tired by the
Malietoans.
Recounting the establishment of the
Provisional Government Herr Rose says
Dr. Raffel, the German president of the
municipal government at Apia, by his ac
tivity, soon won universal approval,, and
quotes the thanks he received from the
British Cousul and the captain of the
Porpoise. Thus, the Cons_il continues,
! the provisional Government was already
j an accomplished fact on January 3.
Relating to the attitude of the warships
the Consul says Dr. Raffel took measures
: for the protection of the British mission,
and he concludes by declaring Mataafa,
; did not take part in the fighting. More
over, he points out, he was recognized on
the English side by a letter published in
the Apia newspapers. According to Con
sul Rose Mataafa was not responsible for
the war, but up to the last endeavored to
prevent it.
In another report Herr Rose describes
the events between January 4 and 9. He
says Dr. Raffel closed the Supreme Court
on January 9 because he thought Mr.
Chambers was precluded by law from ex
ercising the functions of Chief Justice as
long as. the Government was' installed
contrary to his decision and- he remained
In office. After opposing Mr. Maxse's
views that Dr. Raff el's action was an in
sult to the British Hag, Herr Rose de
scribes the forcible opening .of the . Su
preme Court on January 7 by Mr. Cham
bers and Mr. Maxse, while the latter
threatened the bombardment of Apia and
j the Porpoise trained her guns on the Su
preme-Court. Continuing, Herr Rose
i says that at the time of the compulsory
reopening of the Supreme Court he- re
frained from applying to the captain of
1 the Falk.; to protect Dr. Raffel, because
: he did not wish that "armed detachment

EIGHT STORES AT AGANA
OF THESE THE JAPANESE IS

of Goods Is Very
Inferior.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 10.â The Navy
Department has received a dispatch
from a naval officer connected with the
Bennington regarding conditions in the
island of Guam. The report is from
San Luis d'Apra and describes the con-*
ditions at Agana. At this latter place,
he says, there are eight so-called stores,
besides smail wretched huts where na
tive aguardiente is sold. It is made out
of. fermented cocoanut milk.
The stores are classed: First, Manila;
second, Japanese; third, Chinese;
fourth, Chimarro (native), and fifth,
American. There are three of the Ma
nila stores where there are sold ready*
: made articles of apparel, notions in
1 general demand and canned goods of
: poor quality, but expensive. There are
also poor cigars made of â¢ native to
j bacco. The Japanese store is one of
I the best, carrying the same class of
: goods', with some additions. It has
| eggs and bread, the latter baked every
i other day and of a poor quality. The
Chinese store is "very poor. The native
store has a supply of native coffee of
fair quality and excellent chocolate,
also cotton goods.
i The American store is more preten
tious, but inferior to the Japanese. It
carries a large supply of canned goods,
clothes, notions and shoes and furni
ture.
Flour is difficult to obtain. Butter and
lard are not good, owing to the warm
climate.
- Chickens and eggs are plentiful. The
beef is poor and no sheep are raised
inland. There are plenty of pigs. Yams,
sweet potatoes' and corn are'abundant.
Â. Bananas, cocoanuts and bread fruit
are the chief sources of food of the na
tives. There is little fishing, fairly
good clams and a very small oyster of.
sweet taste. There are plenty of deer,
goats, wild turkeys, ducks and. other
game. _____________________

of two friendly states should confront
one another for so slight a cause."
Herr Rose next discussed Mr. Cham
bers' proclamation of January 7, declar
ing the Supreme Court to.be independent
of the existence of any provisional gov
ernment and the communication between
United' 'States Consul Osborne and Mr.
Maxse, declaring Mr. Chambers to be the
sole lawful Chief Justice, even during the
existence of the provisional government.
Mr. Rose continues: ,
When, after consultation with the three Con
suls and Dr. Raffel, the commanders of the two
warships decided to establish a provisional gov
ernment with Dr. Raffel as the head executive.
Captain Sturdee and Mr. Maxse were so im
pressed with the great services rendered to the
English by the guard at the mission on Janu
ary 3, through the energetic intervention of Dr.
Raffel, that they overwhelmed him with praise
and were ready to meet his views .in every way.
Owing to urgent official business in which Dr.
Raffel was engaged, his signature to the
'proclamation relating to the provisional govern
ment was postponed until January 4. when
Dr. Raffel, on January 4, ln accordance with
the arrangement, submitted the draft, Mr.
Maxse, who admitted that he had changed his
opinion, demanded the Insertion of a clause
relating to the general act of the Berlin treaty.
At the suggestion of Mr. Osborne the clause
was formulated as follows:
"By no provision of the proclamation shall
the rights and privileges of the treaty power
representatives be changed or suspended.
Thereupon Mr. Mr. Osborne the clause
formulated as follows:
ly no provision of the proclamation shall
rights and privileges of the treaty power
esentatives be changed or suspended."
hereupon Mr. Rose remarks:
In my opinion It Was a distortion of the
sense of these words to assert that Mr. Cham
bers' position by virtue of the proclamation
remained unaffected by the recent upheaval.
A third report from Herr Rose, dated
January 25, refers to the Grevesmuhl case
and describes how on January 25 Greves^
muhl. a German subject, was sentenced
to a fine and imprisonment by Chief Jus
tice Chambers. The sentence of impris
onment became -ffectiVe forthwith and
Dr. Raffel, "as representative Chief Jus
tice" and by the advice of Herr Rosa,

PEACEFUL MISSION
OF THE PHILADELPHIA
WASHINGTON, March 10.â It is de
nied positively at the State Department
that Rear Admiral Kautz has gone to
Samoa on the Philadelphia to restore
the statu quo existing before the last
emeute, to depose Mataafa and restore
Malietoa Tanu, even if force is neces
sary to accomplish these objects. It is
said the admiral has gone to Samoa to
meet the treaty obligation that is im
posed upon the United States to send
a warship there at least occasionally as
an evidence of the interest held by the
United States in ' the islands. While
there he will make a careful examina
tion of the conditions in the islands and
look Into the events up to the installa
tion of the provisional government, re
porting all the facts to Washington.
His uniform, under former regulations,
when the navy had an admiral, wpuld
be four stars on his shoulder straps,
,the end stars being upon an anchor.
Upon his shoulders he would wear two
very broad bands -of gold, between
which would be a band of yellow half
the width of the outside bands. The
yellow on his sleeves would extend
nearly to the elbow. By a special act of
Congress passed in the closing hours
Admiral Dewey will receive the pay of
the last general of the army.
FEW PROMOTIONS
FOR VALIANT SERVICE
"WASHINGTON, March Applications
for army appointments continue to pour
into the White House, from which they
are forwarded to the War Department.
It is a fact that more than 20,000 applica
tions have been, received for the 101 places
to be filled. > -.
Senator Warren said this morning he
thought the President would yet be com
pelled to use some of the 35,01*0 additional
troops authorized by Congress. Wyoming
is entitled to only one of the lieutenants
to be appointed, and the Senator desires
to give this to a sergeant serving in the
Wyoming regiment at Manila. He thought
merit, bravery and service in the army
should be recognized by promotions.
The comment is frequently made that
among the many promotions to the line
as the outgrowth of the war with Spain
few went to privates and non-commis
sioned officers who distinguished them
selves. New men have received the com
missions in nearly every instance. Prac
tically all the Influence now being exerted
is for the benefit of sons, nephews and
friends of Senators.
TORPEDO THAT CAN BE
STEERED FROM SHORE
LONDON, March 11.â The Daily Chron

which he claims he can steer from the
shore or from a vessel without any con
nection, on some new principle of light

the torpedo at the rate of twenty-two
knots and control it for a distance of six

PETER CASTRO
ARRAIGNED IN
HIS HOME TOWN
Angry Men Gather About the
Court, but No Violence
Is Attempted.
SALINAS, March 10.â people of
Castroville were under high tension
from sunrise till dusk- to-day. There
were rumors that attempts would be
made to lynch Peter Castro, the alleged
assailant of Mrs. James L. Douglass,
and counter rumors that friends of the
accused man would try to take the
prisoner from the Sheriff and liberate
him. The cause of all this excitement
was the fact that Castro was taken
from the prison here to Salinas to-day
for his preliminary arraignment. Sheriff
Farley was fearful there would be some
sort of demonstration on the part of
the enraged citizens of the town and
had taken every precaution to guard
his prisoner, but though throughout the
entire day men gathered in knots on
'street corners and about the court
room and angrily discussed the crime
and the punishment that should be
meted to the suspect, the proceedings
were concluded without an outbreak
and the prisoner was returned to the
Salinas jail.
When Castro appeared before Judge
Clark in the town named after his
grandfather he was worried and ill at
ease. Sheriff Farley kept a close watch
over his man and at no time was Castro
allowed to talk with any of his friends.
Castro, when asked if he had a law
yer, replied he did not and that he
needed none. Justice Clark gave him
until to-morrow to get his attorney and
set the preliminary hearing â¢ for that
time.
When it was asserted the prisoner
wanted no attorney the rumor at once
gained currency that he "would confess
and expose the gang -which has so long
terrorized the community. He did not
say anything damaging while In court
to-day, but it is thought he will con
fess soon. His family is anxious that
he ,tell everything about the Douglass
affair and divulge the names of his
accomplices in other crimes, if he is
guilty; but if he is innocent his rela
tives will defend him through the
courts. Mrs. L. Castro, the mother of
Peter, and his brother, William Castro,
of Watsonville, came over from Castro
ville yesterday and remained for some
time with the accused man in his cell.
William Castro said the purpose of
their visit here was to get Peter to con
fess. â¢-â¢ " .
Peter Castro is the grandson of Man

KIPLING LEARNS OF
HIS. CHILD'S DEATH
â¢ NEW YORK, March 10.â Kip
ling is still improving," said Mr.
Doubleday to-night.
Mr. Kipling had taken some sweet
breads for supper and had been able to
eat more of solid food than at any time
since he became ill.
Unable to keep Mr. Kipling in ignor
ance of the death of his favorite daugh
ter, Josephine, the news was broken to
him to-night by Dr. Dunham. The blow
was a heavy one, but the* father bore
up bravely. ; ;^_ -
"How long was she ill?" he asked.
He was then told as much as the at
tendants thought wise. Tears stood in
the poet's eyes, and he murmured half
to himself, half aloud, "Poor little Joe."
It was thus he always called the little
one. â¢ '-.>;':
The doctors believe it was best to
break the news, as the worry and dis
trust he seemed to have in all the re
plies given to his queries about the lit
tle one -would probably have been more
harmful than to let him have the truth.

some time. The Southern Pacific ex

place, eight miles away. The wealth of
Castro dwindled, but even yet the heirs
of this old Castilian family retain some
of the original grant. They will let it
all go to save the wayward grandson.
A ripple of excitement was caused to
day when P. W. alias "Buck" Silva re
appeared in Castroville. Silva left on
the morning after the Douglass tragedy
and was last seen in Watsonville. Silva
asserted in his usual boastful . man
ner that he had come back to "face the
music" and if any one wanted him he
would find a warm reception. It is
now believed fact asserted by some
of the vigilance committee that Silva
will turn State's evidence and tell all
he knows. However, he most emphat
ically denies any knowledge of the
Douglass tragedy. Silva to-day said
that he was with Castro part of the
evening at a saloon. He got intoxi
cated and retired in the hotel at about
10 o'clock, as he expected to leave town
the next day. On the next morning
when he awoke he found Castro in the
room and dressed. " Castro said he, too,
wanted to leave town. Silva made the
further' assertion that on the night be

Will Test the Meat Packed in Their

Amount of Nutriment
Contained.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 10.â The Court of
Inquiry resumed its work regarding
beef to-day by continuing the investi
gation of processes of preparation at
the stock yards. Several more of the
packing houses were inspected, most of
the time being spent in examining the
methods of one of the companies which
deals exclusively in canned goods. The
various stages from the killing of the
beef to the labeling of the can were
witnessed.
After, having seen an animal killed,
the court followed the carcass to the
refrigerator rooms and from there to
the department where the meat was
cut into pieces for canning. Much in
terest was observed as to the charac
ter of the meat used for canning pur
poses. General Davis was the chief in
quisitor, the other members of the
court being content to simply watch
the various processes. From the cut
ting room the meat .was taken in large
Iron carts to the cooking room, where
it was boiled. Twenty minutes is' the
time allowed for this process, and when
the time had expired, the beef was
taken from the large vats and carted
into the canning room. Dr. Bigelow,
who is â¢ with the court as an expert,
got samples of the extract which re
mained in the vat and will examine' it
to determine the quantity of nutriment
which It contains.
The canning room was next Inspect- S
cd. Here the beef was cut into smaller j
pieces and thrown into a pressing ma- !
chine, through which it passed into the I
cans. The meat was then ready for
the "roasting" process, but as the
ovens were not quite ready,- the court
spent some time in looking over the
departments where the cans are made, j
This was done so that' the court might j
have full knowledge as to the manner j
of getting the cans ready for the beef.
After witnessing the roasting process.
the court left the packing house and
adjourned to meet at 10 o'clock to-mor
row morning.
Three army commissaries have been
summoned to appear, and it is expected j
their testimony will be taken.

they immediately notified their attorneys
to attach the property. The 'judgment
against Sigafus was obtained in Los

could be found on execution, although
the creditors claim to have been aware
that Sigafus had a fortune in bonds and

UNION BANK CASE
Board of Directors Not
Yet Named.
COURT WANTS MORE TIME
CONTINUES THE MATTER TO
NEXT MONDAY.
Judge Lorigan Intimates He Will
Reappoint All but Two of the
Members Who Have Just
Resigned.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAN JOSE. March 10.â The appoint
ment of a board of directors to close
the business of the defunct Union Sav
ings Bank was not made by Judge Lori
gan this morning, but went over till
Monday morning at 10 o'clock. The
directors, stockholders and depositors
were represented by counsel and
Deputy Sturtevant appeared for the
Attorney General. The court inquired
if a person not a stockholder could be
named as director. Sturtevant was not
certain about this and said the safer
way would be to name only stockhold
ers. He was of the opinion that one
who had acquired stock since the fail
ure could become a member of the di
rectorate.
Judge Lorigan said he was not yet
ready to name the directors. If Direc
tor C. P. Braslan had resigned he would
have had the stockholders elect a board.
As it was he would appoint six direct
ors, as Braslan would make the
seventh. He had received a telegram
from Gilroy asking the court to give
the stockholders of that section repre
sentation on the board of directors. He
felt inclined to give all sides a repre
sentative, but the depositors at the last
meeting decided they did not care about
It. The board of directors that had
just resigned was in charge of affairs
until Its successor had been elected and
it could make arrangements to look
after its interests at the meeting of
Howard's creditors to be held on Mon-
day.
Judge Lorlgan has intimated that he
will reappoint the directors, with prob
ably two exceptions, that have just
tendered their resignations. These are
Amasa Eaton, Cyrus Jones, W. H.
Wright. N. Bowden, L. Callisch, J. W.
Rea and C. P. Braslan. Wright and
Bowden are the only ones who were in
the directorate at the time of the fail
ure and Bowden had been elected but
a couple of weeks when the crash came.
The court has said he would not name
an attorney and in this case Bowden, in
whom all depositors have the greatest
confidence, will not be reappointed.
George T. Dunlop of Gilroy probably
will be named in his stead.
The board of directors of the Union
Savings Bank met this afternoon and
considered Howard's indebtedness.
They selected C. H. Bills as their favor
ite in the choice of a receiver in How
ard's bankruptcy. In case Bills be not
elected they ask the creditors to con
sider Jacob Miller. Ralph Hersey and
G. K. Fleming- for the position, in the
order named.
The depositors are not pleased with
the continual delay in the bank matter
and a large number of them now want
suit brought against the stockholders.
THOUSANDS OF IDLE
MEN IN DAWSON
Unabie to Leave Because They Have
Not the Wherewithal to
Make the Trip.
JUNEAU. Alaska. Feb. 27.â W. C. Ros
ner of 1611 Bush street, San Francisco,
who has been in Alaska about a year and
was quite a well-known young attorney
of San Francisco, has just returned from
a trip to Dawson. He was in business
there for a time. Mr. Rosner reports that
no such large number of men as were
reported to be on the trail a few weeks
ago are coming out. A decision of the
police to give accommodations at the
posts on the river to no one who had no
rnonev stopped the exodus before, in
fact, it got fairly started. Consequently
several thousand Idle men still have noth
ing to do In Dawson and will remain In
that condition indefinitely. A large num
ber of people will go down the river to
Eagle city in the spring when the ice
breaks.
Alexander McDonald's water front snap
âthat is. the lease has been hung up:
Inoperative and unproductive. in court
slr.ee last May, the tenants having refused
to pay rent "and a suit, yet undecided,
having been brought against them in
ejectment. Â
Mr. Rosner is reported to have made a
stake in Dawson, and will return there
for more in a few weeks after visiting
San Francisco.

â  SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 10.â The business community was greatly â

CANADIANS WILL
BE DRIVEN OUT
Trouble Brewing on the
Porcupine.
AMERICANS TO RETALIATE
WILL BAR ALIENS FROM THE
DISTRICT.
The Miners Are Planning to Formu
late and Put Into Execution
an Exclusion Act of
Their Own.
By HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU. Alaska, Feb. 27.â A report
which came down from Porcupine
Creek by the steamer Wolcott, plying
j between Juneau and Haines Mission,
I caused excitement here. It* was to the
; effect that the Canadian flag had been
moved down the trail from Pleasant
I camp, on the Dalton trail, four miles,
so as to take in the Porcupine, Salmon
Creek and other placer mining districts
in American territory. Coming as It
did about the time sensational stories
were wired from Washington, D. C,
concerning the acquisition of Lynn
Canal by the British, it received con
siderable credence. Investigation has
j proved the report untrue up to the pres
ent time. It is known here, however,
that a Canadian police officer left Lake
Bennett recently for Lake Tagish with
j instructions to secure there an extra
j detail of police, return to Bennett and
proceed thence to Porcupine post.
The situation on Porcupine Creek is
strained anyhow. There is little doubt
j that should the Canadians get that sec
-1 tion of country many claims would not
; be abandoned without bloodshed.
Sentiment is crystallizing there
j against allowing any Canadian to make
; a location or to mine there in retaliation
I for the exclusion of Americans from
I Atlin. As is well known some of the
; Canadian police at Pleasant camp post
I have staked claims at Porcupine. A
movement is on foot to quietly notify
! all aliens holding locations in American
territory to get out of the country. This
would be done through a miners' meet
ing, and such a meeting would be
j secret, as the law gives aliens equal
rights to mine. Anybody who knows
' anything about miners' meetings knows
; that what the miners decide on is
; usually carried out to the letter. No
man would dare to stay in a mining
camp of the West or Northwest after
having been notified to vamose. It is
ten to one that the proposed action will
be taken in the Porcupine country.
C. P. Cahoon of Minnesota, the loca
tor of discovery claim on McKinley
Creek, is now here. He says he has
heard a large number of men express
themselves against allowing any Can
adian, policeman or not, to work a
claim there. Other locators on McKin
ley Creek are C. <}. Lewis of Los Ange
les, Cal.; Carl West of Los Angeles and
Charles Leitch of Los Angeles, W. S.
} Hawes of Minnesota, Alexander Mc-
I Conaghy of Colorado, Bert Wooden of
Colorado and Ed Hackley of Washing
ton State. Mr. Cahoon says these men
are opposed to allowing Canadians to
mine.
Some claim-jumping is now going on
in Porcupine, but not to any great ex
tent. Small steamers on Lynn Canal
are carrying more freight and passen
gers to Haines Mission each trip. At
the present rate there will be at least
3000 people on the trails and creeks
back of the mission in thirty lays. The
weather is now very cold and windy,
but it does not seem to stop the crowd.
It has been unusually cold at Atlin
and over the summit of White Pass re
cently, ranging from 50 to 60 degrees
below. Many menâ more than half the
construction force on the Skaguay
Railroad will quit work In a few days,
partly on account of the cold, but
mainly owing to a reduction of wages
from $2 50 to $1 70 per day.

ST. SCHOLASTIQUE, Quebec, March
10. â Mrs. Cordelia Poirier and Samuel
Parslow were hanged here to-day at
8:05 a. m. Life was declared extinct in
eight minutes, the necks of both having
been broken. Mrs. Poirier, who said
farewell to her relatives last night, was
firm and collected throughout. She
took part in the mass said at 5 o'clock
this morning and on the scaffold shook
hands with the hangman without a
tremor. The crowd inside the jail
jeered at her, but even then her com
posure did not desert her, and at the
suggestion of the executioner she
turned and faced the jeerers and stood
erect and prayed to the last. Parslow
was more dead than alive when the
drop fell.
The condemned were taken to the
scaffold separately and were kept from
seeing each other by a screen placed
between them. Six hundred men who
had remained up all night witnessed
the execution.
Outside the jail there were 7000 more,
who tried to batter down the gate of
the jail yard and could only be made to
desist by the provincial police firing
their revolvers in the air. The behavior
of the crowd Inside was such that one ;
of th- priests, Rev. Father Meloche, had â¢
to reprove them from the scaffold.
Mrs. Cordelia Poirier and Samuel Pars
low, her reputed lover, were hanged for
the murder of Isldor Poirier, the woman's
husband, in 1897. The crime was commit
ted In the Poirier home in St. Canute.
Quebec. Mrs. Poirier. who was 33 years
of age. was the organist of the Roman
Catholic church at St. Jerome, where
Parslow sang In the choir. Both prison
er- confessed their guilt, each seeking to
put the blame on the other.
Mrs. Poirier was the third woman of
eleven condemned since the confederation
to receive capital punishment. The two
women who had previously suffered the
death penalty since the confederation
were Phoebe Campbell, hanged at Lon
don In 1872, for cutting her husband's
throat with a knife, and Elizabeth Work
man, hanged at Sarnia a year later for
beating her husband to death with a club.
The sentences of eight of the eleven mur
deresses were commuted to life Imprison
ment. The crime of six of these women
was the murder of their husbands.
PROTEST AGAINST
SUNDAY SALOONS
Los Angeles Temperance Workers
Address an Appeal to the City
Council.
LOS ANGELES] March 10.â Temperance
workers who are bestirring themselves
in opposition to the petition of saloon men
asking for the repeal of the midnight and
Sunday closing ordinances are circulating
a remonstrance to be formally presented
to the Council as. an expression of the
sentiments of the signers. It is in these
words:
To the Honorable Council, City of Los Ange
les: Whereas. There is a movement on foot to
influence the City council to repeal the ordi
nance for Sunday closing and midnight clos
ing of saloons In Los Angeles, and enact a
substitute by which saloons may run all night
by the payment of $10 a month, and run open
on Sunday by an additional $10 added to the
regular license of $."0 a month; therefore, we.
the undersigned voters of Los Angeles, respect
fully enter pretest against the repeal or the
law enacted by popular movement nine years
ago We furthermore favor strict enforcement
against all violators. We heartily favor the
recommendation of the Mayor and the Police
Commission that all saloons have but one
entrance, and that from the front.
In view of the strong efforts by the
conflicting forces and the complications of
interests of temperance people, retail
dealers, restaurant men, soda fountain
owners and druggists, the Council ap
pears in no hurry to adopt an ordinance
changing the present order of things.

WAS MRS. LUNG
DEVOTED THE
FLOWING BOWL?
Her Appetite Caused
Much Comment.
SEVERAL DEPOSITIONS READ
CORROBORATE THE HUSBAND'S
DIVORCE COMPLAINT.
Residents of Honolulu Tell What
They Know Regarding the Hab
its of Dr. Lung's Eccen
tric Wife.
The action recently instituted by Dr.
George A. Lung of the United States
cruiser Philadelphia for a divorce from
his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Lung, on the
ground of Intemperance, was taken up
by Judge Hebbard yesterday morning and
a number of Interesting depositions bear
ing on the wife's devotion to the flowing
bowl were opened and read. Dr. Lung
charges that on many occasions Mrs.
Lung, whom he married in Philadelphia
June 1, 188S, disgraced him while laboring
under hallucinations caused by overin
dulgence in liquor. These charges are
corroborated in a large measure by the
depositions given by various people of Ho
nolulu.
The sworn statement of A. S. Hum
phries, an attorney of Honolulu, first en
tertained the court and spectators. In
the document he states that he was well
aware that Mrs. Lung often indulged in
intoxicants to excess, and when In this
condition she complained to the witness
that her husband was paying too much
attention to Mrs. Jack Winter of Hono
lulu, a charge which Dr. Lung indignant
ly denies. Humphries tells a story re
garding a painful incident which occurred
in the presence of various people when
deponent's wife met Mrs. Lung. The lat
ter referred to her new acquaintance as
a "flat nosed Chinese woman." a remark
that caused no end of scandal in Hono
lulu.
Humphries further stated that Mrs.
Lung's conduct was such that Admiral
Walker of the flagship refused to permit
her to board the vessel and informed the
officers that they should not recognize
her. Under cross-examination witness
testified that Mrs. Lung's remark asso
ciating her husband and Mrs. Winter al
most caused a conflict between Dr. Lung
and Mr. Winter. This trouble all origi
nated at the annexation ball, witness
said, where Mrs. Lung charged her hus
band openly with devoting all his time to
Mrs. Winter.
The deposition of Mrs. J. H. Paty is
short but interesting. She met Mrs. Lung
in a car one day, so she alleges. Mrs.
Lung was intoxicated and swore at her
tor no cause, much to her discomfort.
Miss Mabel l. add, who resides at ?â¢*>
Nuuanu avenue, in the island city, says
that Mrs. Lung was Of a jealous, excita
ble disposition and was given to drinking
to excess. When asked on cross-exami
nation If she did not know that Dr. Lung
treated his wife cruelly and consorted
with disreputable people, the witness dis
claimed all knowledge of such affairs.
Next Friday a demurrer to the com
plaint will be argued, and in event it i
overruled the trial will commence Imme
diately It is Mrs. Lung's purpose to
fight the case to the end. an intention
which may reveal a family skeleton of
striking characteristics.

THE HARBOR COMMISSION BILL.
rROM every point of view the defeat of Dickin
son's Harbor Commission bill by the decisive
vote of 24 to 11 in the Senate is commendable and
gratifying. The measure was of the kind popularly
known as "peanut politics." It was pernicious in
principle and would have been wasteful and offensive
in practice. The Republican party can take credit
from the fact that the bill was killed by its representa
tives.
As has been pointed out by The Call, the bill was
without a single redeeming feature. It was a political
job, not pure and simple, but impure and complex.
It bore on its face every evidence of having been de
signed to create new offices with salaries for the bene
fit of office-seekers, and opened a way for the appoint
ment of an additional lot of political henchmen to the
payroll of the State.
The character of the support given to it in the Sen
ate was in due accord with that of the bill itself.
After Senator Boyce had made clear the facts that the
bill provided no remedy whatever for existing evils in
the administration of the affairs of the harbor, but on
the contrary tended to make them worse by the addi
tion of two more spoilsmen with their following of
hungry tax-eaters, Senator Morehouse frankly de
clared himself in favor of that kind of thing. He sup
ported the bill because it was a spoils bill, and made
no attempt to prove it be anything else.
The better element of the Republican party did not
lack a champion to reply to the advocate of the spoils
system. Senator Davis in a vigorous speech upheld
the pledges of the party to the people, and declared he
would not be one to make all the civil service planks
in Republican platforms to be but lies. As the result
proved he spoke the sentiment of the great majority
of Republicans in the Senate as well as in the State,
and nothing the friends of the job had to say in re
ply weakened the effect of his masterly defense of po
litical honesty against jobbery and the betrayal of
pledges.
The defeat of the bill is beneficial in many ways.
It protects the revenues of the State against the waste
of a useless increase of salaries, it tends to check cor
ruption in the management of the harbor and opens
a way for true remedial legislation, it baffles the
efforts of the Burns gang to provide more patronage
to be distributed in the interest of their boss, it up
holds the standard of Republican honor and marks
the taking of an important step toward ridding Cali
fornia of that petty spoils system of politics which has
been so pernicious to all the interests of her people.
It is now clear that this Legislature will deserve a
high degree of approval from the people. It has stood
firm against the intrigues of the Southern Pacific and
a gang of corrupt politicians backed by the Exam
iner to elect a disreputable and dishonored man to the
United States Senate, and in repeated instances has
shown a resolution to give the State an economical
administration. It has not been favorable to cinch
bills nor to political jobbery. It has given many evi
dences of a desire to keep faith with the people, and
one of the most -striking of these was the overwhelm
ing vote that crushed the schemes for jobbery and
boodle involved in the Harbor Commission bill.
Just why anybody should be posing as "Soapy
Smith" is not easily understood. Soapy was one of
the worst scoundrels who ever met a merited fate in
getting shot, and if the pretender can get himself ac
cepted as genuine there ought to be a lot of jails
yawning for him.
That regiment of immuncs which has been painting
a streak of red across the South seems to overlook the
fact that peace has been declared. If terrible in
war as after war is over, they would be bad people
to meet in action.
The spectacle of American soldiers being baptized
in the Pasig River will strike native observers as pe
culiar. Only the other day an army of natives was
driven into that same river, and so far as revealed here
is there yet.
Town Topics, a New York weekly publication, is
assailing General Miles. While this is doubtless un
pleasant for the gentleman, the situation would be
much worse if the paper were praising him instead.
While London anarchists who claim responsibility
for the explosion at Toulon arc in all probability ly
ing, there could be no harm in taking them at their
word this time.
Perhaps if packers were in the habit of canning dis
eased meat they would refrain from the practice while
a court of inquiry was engaged in inspection.
That Admiral Dewey's hair should have turned gray
rapidly is not surprising. The head under that hair
hasn't been turned any.
THE BURNS FLOP.
ANOTHER turn has occurred in the* Burns
policy. It is so acute as to excite derision and
supply the element of humor in this long and
rapidly dying intrigue. On Wednesday the purging of
Milton Green of contempt and his discharge by the
House was gall, wormwood, poke root and every
thing bitter and puckery to the Burns men. The ever
serviceable Dibble, who can always be relied on to
give a good reason for a bad action, in that cheerful
spirit which meets an emergency in politics by calling
forgery a clerical error and perjury a poetic license,
had shouted himself into' prismatic colors in benalf
of the honor of the House. He had asserted that to
purge Green was to disgrace the House. The Burns
touts invaded the floor and left the smell of their
fingers in the buttonholes of the members, and
ranted, persuaded, blasphemed and implored to get
support for Dibble's anxiety that the House should
not disgrace itself. In that behalf nasty blows and
nastier words were exchanged, and Green was not
purged.
Within twenty-four hours the scene and its spirit
changed. Dibble appeared in behalf of purging
Green, and himself, good political apothecary, fur
nished the purgative. One day before this had been
such deep disgrace of the House that Dibble mourned
lest his good name should go into hectic decline if it
were done. What was a deadly sin on Wednesday
was put among the beatitudes on Thursday, and by
the same men.
It was an admonitory* illustration of the idea of
principles, of right and wrong, of, the decent and in
decent, held by Burns and his supporters. One day
an act is denounced by them in every term and phrase
of contempt and deprecation, and the next day, with
a cheek as blushless as a crocodile's, they father the
same act and carry it out.
With them the sole measure and standard is the
effect of any act upon the candidacy of Burns. On
Wednesday they thought opposition to purging Green
would make votes for Burns, so they opposed and
put their opposition upon the high ground of prin
ciple, and declaimed in behalf of the vestal reputation
of the House. But all this brought no votes for
Burns. On the contrary, it repelled some that seemed
inclined to come. Whereupon the same men ex
changed the lilies and languors of virtue. for the roses
and raptures of vice, and, with only one sleep be
tween, on Thursday did that which on Wednesday
they had declared would disgrace the House and stain
it forever!
The quiet people who watch what goes on and
thank God it goes no worse will not fail to prop
erly analyze this change, and will hope that the same
men will not close the session by trying to reseat
Wright as Speaker of the House.
LET US HfIVE ECONOMY.
IT. is apparent now that California is to endure
another dry year. There have been droughts be
fore, but our prospective experience is novel, in
that we are faced with a drought extending over two
years. The field crop planters are already resigned to
the situation, and the deciduous and citrus orchard
ists are wisely sacrificing, in the arid districts, any
prospect of a crop in order to save their trees. In
Southern California, where the Sweetwater and Bear
Valley reservoirs have run dry, the orange and lemon
planters arc cutting their trees back, eradicating all
bearing wood and reducing the bark and foliage, so
that the tree will live on less moisture and be carried
over until normal rainfall is restored. So every in
terest that can protect itself and wait is getting under
cover, and under the circumstances the most unwel
come visitor during the next biennium will be the
Tax Collector.
The Legislature should not forget this. It is no
time for large appropriations to feed fads in State in
stitutions or support new official positions. Every
household in the State is already settled down to
economies fitted to the conditions of the drought.
Let the housekeeping of the State likewise adjust it
self.
The Governor has shown a commendable spirit of
economy and has used his veto in that direction with
praiseworthy impartiality. There are many measures yet
pending which will need his attention, if they pass.
Some of them create new offices and salaries. It is
highly probable that one of these is the Oakland
Harbor Commission bill. There is grave doubt in
commercial circles in Oakland that such an establish
ment is needed or will pay back in any service the
burdensome tax on commerce required for its sup
port. For reasons added to the water-front litigation
and derived entirely from the commercial situation it
is evident that Oakland will in no respect suffer if she
is not now loaded with this rather sumptuously sala
ried adjunct. The sentiment of the State government
should be no expenditure for ornamental or senti
mental improvements, and no new salaried offices,
except upon the plainest demonstration of their ne
cessity.
ADMIRAL DEWEY'S HEALTH-
A SENSATIONAL report sent out from- Van
couver a few days ago to the effect that a
British officer on his way home from Manila
had declared Admiral Dewey's health to be seriously
undermined has been promptly refuted from Wash
ington. Government officials have received no infor
mation of any illness of the Admiral nor of any need
or desire on his part for rest. On the contrary, a
dispatch was received from him some time ago say
ing: "I trust it may not be necessary to order, me to
Washington. Should very much regret to leave here
while matters remain in the present critical condi
tion."
The promptness with which the refutation to the
alarming rumor has been given is gratifying. At 'the
present time the sole danger point on the horizon of
our national affairs is at Manila, and while the danger
even there is not great, yet serious consequences
might result from any mismanagement of our dealings
with the natives and the rights of European resi
dents. It is, therefore, desirable we should have in
command at that point a wise as well as a brave man,
for the successful solution of the problems involved
in the issues requires the tact of a diplomatist as well
as the courage of a warrior.
Of course no man is essential to the affairs of a
great nation. Out of the ranks of a vigorous people
there never fail to come forth leaders to take the place
of those whom wounds, sickness, old age or death
remove from command. Nevertheless, the personal
ity of a strong, sagacious man is always one of the
controlling factors in the history of a nation, and
whenever such a man is found in the right place at a
time when his country needs him anything which
threatens to force his retirement is a matter of serious
concern to all.
Admiral Dewey has proven himself to be exactly
the man whom we need at this juncture in the Orient.
He has served several years in that part of the world
and knows its problems and its people better than
the officials at Washington than any man we
can reasonably hope to find when the time comes to
THE SAN' FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 11, 1899.
substitute another in command. Therefore the rumor
of his ill-health, coming from a seemingly well
authenticated source, was a cause of much disquietude
and there will be a feeling of no little satisfaction in
its prompt refutation.
BRITISH NfqVflL ESTIMATES.
GOSCHEN'S speech to the Commons on in
, troducing the naval estimates for the year
dealt with the proposed expenditure of large
sums with such a simple gravity of manner that at
times it was almost amusing. For example, he
gravely informed the Commons that the outlook for
the British navy is not reassuring, because the United
States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy and Japan
have under construction an aggregate of 685,000 tons
of warships, or 225,000 tons more than is contemplated
in the British estimates.
The quiet assumption in this statement that things
are not reassuring unless Great Britain constructs
every year more war vessels than all the other great
nations of the globe, with Japan thrown in, verges
very close on the humorous. The very' gravity with
which the statesmen of the little island in the North
Sea, located between the Irish Channel and the Ger
man Ocean, propose to go up against the whole world
when it comes to a sea fight has in it something of a
gasconade, and is the more entertaining because not
intended for a boast.
Mr. Goschen, however, was not humorous, nor was j
he boastful. He was quite in earnest. He would like
to see upon the ocean a British navy as powerful as j
that of all the rest of the world combined, and, finding I
the desire is not to be attained this year, he regards
the outlook as dubious and perceives nothing on the
horizon which he can point out to his countrymen as
reassuring.
Despite his somewhat despondent tone, however,
the Right Honorable gentleman, the First Lord of
the Admiralty, had a pretty good naval programme to
submit. It comprised in the aggregate an expendi
ture for naval purposes during the coming year of
Â£26,594,000, or considerably more than $100,000,000.
Of course not all the amount is for ships. Some is
for new naval stations, and the Russians and the
Chinese will note with passing interest that something
like $15,000,000 is to be expended in fitting up the
port of Wei-Hai-Wei, where, as Mr. Goschen
pointed out, there is a "valuable anchorage."
In the meantime, since the naval outlook is not re
assuring, her Majesty's Government is heartily sec
onding the peace proposals of the Czar. The confer
ence will not cost as much money as the naval es
timates amount to, nor even so much as the single
item of the anchorage at Wei-Hai-Wei. Perhaps the
British can find some pleasing promise in that pros
pect. It is safe to assert, however, they will none the
less adopt the naval bill without a division and put
another penny on the beer and the income tax and go
along grumbling, as is their custom, because other na
tions spend so much on their navies.
THE Senate passed a bill the other day which
should be promptly enacted into law by the As
sembly. We refer to the measure introduced by
Senator Braunhart and known to the legislative files
as Senate bill No. 202. It is a proposition to amend
sections 204 and 205 of the Code of Civil Procedure
so as to change the method of drawing trial juries in
the Superior Courts of the State. As originally pre
pared and introduced by Senator Braunhart its opera
tion was confined entirely to San Francisco, but the
Senate considered the idea so good that it enlarged its
application to the entire State.
The amendments proposed relate mainly to the
process of selecting the names of those appointed to
serve as trial jurors. The Judges are left to prepare
the lists as at present, but rules are set up which re
quire a more careful inspection of persons and a
greater responsibility is thrown upon the clerks of the
courts, who are commanded to examine the lists and
report upon the personal characters of the proposed
jurors.
Another amendment provides that no person shall
be obliged to serve as a trial juror for more than one
month in the year, unless a longer service is de
manded by a trial for which he has been impaneled.
Nor is any trial juror to serve on more than five
causes during the term for which he may have been
selected, and whenever a juror has served on five
causes the clerk of the court is required to strike his
name from the list. It is thought that this latter pro
vision, by making jury duty easy, will attract to the
box a more reputable class of citizens, or, what is the
same thing, remove some of their objections to
serving.
It is to be hoped that the Assembly will pass this
bill, if for no other reason than to give the new sys
tem a trial. Certainly the selection of juries could
not be looser than it is at present, and anything which
will throw around trials greater restrictions is in the
line of useful legislation.
WORKMEN OPPOSE THE Rf.CES.
I~*HAT workmen as individuals should oppose
racing as conducted at Ingleside is not strange.
That as a body they should have paused in their
routine to denounce it was unexpected, and brings
into the contest a new element to combat the iniquity
of the debased "sport" and to check the tide of gold
flowing into the hands of the touts and bookmakers.
The hangers-on of Ingleside, and also the managers,
threaten dire things in case the Supervisors shall
carry out the expressed determination to deprive them
of their power for evil. It seems certain that the
friendship of the workmen is far more valuable than
that of the gamblers. That their influence is greater
and their honest opinions are entitled to respect there
can be no question. The Supervisors, setting aside
the moral aspect of the situation, can well afford to
listen to the voice of these honest toilers.
Workmen are of the people. In the sweat of
his brow the laborer at any manual calling must earn
his bread,' and as he earns it, rearing a family and
providing for his home out of his wage, he has a
right to protection against the wiles of the confidence
operator. He ought to be assured that while he is at
his forge or bench his boy is not being robbed at the
racetrack, led into evil associations and trained to a
career of uselessness or even of crime.
There are many instances known of women neglect
ing their household duties and their little ones so as
to attend the races, there to bet and to squander the
scanty store which should go for rent or shoes, doing
this while the head of the house was away earning
more and never suspecting that the rounders of the
tenderloin were to have that same money to spend.
In some cases the result has been a tragedy.
It is good that the workmen have spoken officially.
Their clear and decisive words show how wide
spread is the interest in the subject, and will go far
to offset the threats and cajolery of the parasites of
which the community is striving to rid itself.
People with a taste for horse meat probably have
a' right to indulge it, but the average American sol
dier prefers beef.
f. GOOD BILL.
BROKE DOWN OFF POINT REYES.
THE collier Empire came to grief while on her way to Coos Bay.
She sailed back as far as Duxbury Reef, when the wind became
unfavorable and Captain Mason anchored his vessel. Yester
day morning the steam schooner Luella, from Point Arena, came
along and towed her into port. It will be two weeks before the Em
pire is ready for sea again. ,
COLLIER EMPIRE
IS DISABLED
UP THE COAST
Towed Back to Port
by the Luella.
SUBSIDIZED FRENCH VESSELS
ELEVEN OF THEM ON THEIR
WAY TO THIS PORT.
Helen N. Kimball Overdue at Pana
maâLumber Vessels for South
Africaâ of the May
Flint.
The -team collier Empire returned to
port yesterday in tow of the steam
schooner Luella, The Empire left here
for Coos Bay last Thursday and all went
well until Point Reyes was reached, when
the crank shaft broke. This left the ves
sel helpless as far as the engines were
concerned, but Captain Nelson soon got
sail on her and headed for San Francisco.
When off Duxbury Reef the sea became
rough and a head wind was encountered,
so the vessel was anchored. One of the
black stack tugs went to her assistance,
but a bargain could not be struck.
Early yesterday morning several steam
schooners hove in sight and the Luella
bore down on the disabled collier. The
two captains came to an agreement and
the Luella took the Empire in tow. She
was brought through the Heads without
any bother, and when off Lime Point the
tug Sea Queen came along and relieved
the Luella of her tow. The Luella went
to Third and Berry streets wharf to dis
charge her cargo of lumber and the Em
pire was docked at Vallejo street wharf.
It will take a couple of weeks to repair
the collier, and in the meantime the Coos
Bay Coal Company will have to secure
another vessel to take her place. ,
The owners of the schooner Helen N.
Kimball are wondering what has become
of their vessel. She left Eureka on De
cember 3 last in company with the schoon
er Esther Buhne. The Kimball was bound
for Panama with a load of lumber and
the Buhne for .Honolulu with a similar
cargo. The Buhne arrived at Honolulu
December 30, discharged and loaded and
was back in San Francisco on February
2. A week later she was on her way to
Puget Sound and two days ago she sailed
again from New Whatcom for San Fran
cisco. The Kimball has not been heard
from since she left Eureka ninety-eight
days ago. Panama is about 1200 miles fur
ther south of Eureka than is Honolulu,
but the Esther Buhne has covered three
times that distance since she left Eureka
in company with the Helen X. Kimball.
The owners of the schooner are not
very anxious about her. They think she
may have reached Panama and that Cap
tain Guttormsen has failed to notify them
of her arrival. Still, none of the mail
steamers. mention having spoken her. The
Kimball is a stanch schooner, splendidly
found, and if anything has happened to
her It must have been In an exceptional
blow. She was built in Cuffeys Cove in
1881. and is 188 tons net burden. She Is
112.5 feet long, 80.8 feet beam and 0.2 feet
in draft. The vessel has been in the coast
trade since she was built.
American lumber Is in demand in South
Africa and a number of grain vessels not
liking the outlook for next season are
accepting charters for Cape Town and
Delagoa Bay. The Kennebec arrived at
Cape Town on March 2 from Puget Sound
with a load of lumber and the ships
James Nesmith and John A. Brlggs and
barkentine John Smith are now out
eighty-two, seventy-two and sixty-six
days respectively from points on the
Sound for the ports named. In addition
to these the British ships Olivebank and
British General and the American ship
M. P. Grace, now in this port, have been
chartered to go to the Sound to load for
South Africa.
Including vessels loading at the islands
there are now sixty-five American vessels
listed for this port. At the same time
there are forty-five British vessels, eleven
French, three Italian, two German, four
Hawaiian, one Norwegian, one Japanese
and one Chilean on their way here.
The above figures are given to show
what a subsidy will do for the mercantile
marine of a country. A short time ago
France decided to pay a mileage subsidy
to her sailing vessels. At that time it was
a very rare thing to see the French tri
color In the port of San Francisco while
at this time last year only two French
vessels were on their way here. Now
there are eleven and the chances are that
many more will be seen In these
waters before the year is out.
â  Flint & Co. of New York have decided
that there is nothing In sailing vessels.
Some years ago the British ship Persian
Monarch was wrecked on the American
coast. She was purchased by Flint & Co.,
who spent considerable money in repair
ing her, after which she was placed under
the American flag and renamed the May
Flint. Ever since she has been sailing in
and out of ports In the United States. 'but
now her American owners have resold her
to an English firm and the stars and
stripes are to be hauled down and the
cross of St. George hoisted in its stead.
The name May Flint is to be effaced and
the old name Persian Monarch replaced.
She is now under charter to carry coal oil
from New York to Japan. <-
Three tugs for use in Manila Bay and
among the Philippines have been pur
chased by the United States Government
in Hongkong. They are the Kar Shun,
7.cc Fat and Kura Hing^at present, but
the chances are that Admiral Dewey will
rechristen them as they are handed over
to him. Each tug is 100 tons burden. Â£7
feet long. 14 feet 7 inches beam and 8 feet
draft. They were built and engineered
by Chinese and were especially prepared
for the trip to Manila. They will be used
to transport troops from point to point
when necessary.

FEARED
The Monterey.
the consternation
. 4 Â§>+ created among
the Spanish soldiers when the formidable
Monterey steamed into the harbor. Under
orders from Admiral Dewey, when the
fleet moved into the harbor preparatory
to lowering the Spanish flag and raising
the stars and stripes over the forts, the
Monterey kept well inshore. The remain
der of Uncle Sam's warships, stripped for
action, stood well out In the harbor. Every
one remembers that not a shot was fired
on the city, and the Spaniards made no
attempt to damage the American fleet.
This surprised the naval officers and their
surprise was still greater when they saw
the fortifications and forts which the
Spanish failed to defend. Captain Hooper
was one of the officers detailed to go
ashore to receive the surrender of the Ma
nila forts. In the largest and best fort
were a number of great guns which could
have done much damage to the warships
if the Spaniards had been courageous
enough to use them. The commandant of
the fort was an Intelligent Spaniard and
spoke English fluently. After the surren
der had been made Captain Hooper sat
down to chat with this officer, and during
their conversation said to him:
"Pardon my question, as I ask it out of
curiosity, but why did you not fire on us
when you had such a fort and such guns
as these here?"
"Well, I'll tell you why," courteously
replied the Spanish commandant. "You
see those warships way out there? We
saw what kind of h they raised with
Admiral Montojo's fleet. Well, you see
that thing close inshore? {pointing to
the Monterey). We never saw anything
like it before and we did not know what
kind of h it would raise, and we did
not invite it by resisting the Americans."
Captain Hooper then gave the Spaniard
a general description of the Monterey and
her guns, at the conclusion of which his
listener remarked:
"You Americanos are devils for building
machines to raise h with."

MORGUE OFFICIALS BLAMED
PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION
OF DANIEL SCATENA.
The Testimony of Dr. Zabala, Au
topsy Physician, Leads to Ad
verse Criticism by the
Police.
The preliminary examination of Daniel
Scatena. charged with the murder of his
partner, S. Brancoli, In their fruit store
on Larkin street, was commenced before
Judge Graham yesterday afternoon. Pros
ecuting Attorney Carpenter conducted the
! case for the people, and Attorneys Devoto
! and Demartinf represented the defendant.
The witnesses examined for the prose
! cution were O. Brancoli, Frank Tompkln
! son, D. McSweeney, Mrs. Elsie Willen
brick, Daniel Lyons and Detective Wren.
The evidence was practically the same as
given at the Coroner's inquest. Tompkin
son, the boy employed in the store, saw
two of the shots fired. Scatena came to
him after the shooting and said that
Brancoli had a knife, and the boy, being
frightened, did not contradict him. Yes
terday he testified that Brancoli had noth
ing in his hand. Mrs. Willenbrick also
saw two shots fired, and saw Brancoli
turning around toward Scatena just be
fore the shots were tired. McSweeney tes
tified that he heard the three shot.-, Ihe
first had a muffled sound and the others
two sounded clearer. Scatena told him
that the man who fired the shots had run
a The' theory of the prosecution is that
after the quarrel between Scatena ana
Brancoli the latter turned to leave in
store, when Scatena placed the moh
against his back and fired the first shot.
Brancoli straightened himself up as he
wheeled around, and the other two shots
were then tired at him. According to thi*
! theory the murder was deliberate and
I self-defense could not be established.
i Dr. Zabala, the autopsy physician, was
1 also a witness and his testimony sur
! prised the prosecution. At the inquest he
I testified that the cause of death was hem
orrhage following a gunshot wound. Yes
terday he testified that there were two
wounds. In one Instance the bullet had
entered the back, ranged upward and
came out at the left shoulder and was
the cause of death. The other had en
tered the right breast and lodged in the
chest cavity, where he found it.
The coat worn by Brancoli at the time
of the shooting was produced in court and
"it was in a mutilated .condition. The lin
i ings where the bullet in the back had en
i tered, had been clipped away with a pair
iof scissors removing all traces of tne
powder marks and burns.' The importance
of this evidence is shown by. the fact that
witnesses for the prosecution all testified
that Brancoli's coat was burning at the
back when they saw him. A portion of
the front of the coat had also been cut
Iwav The mutilation of the garment had
been made at the Morgue, but for what
purpose is not known. The matter will be
investigated, as there was apparently an
attempt on the part of some one to de
stroT an imnortant link in the chain of
evidence. The prosecution also contends
that three bullets entered Brancoli's body,
and they base their contention on the con
dition of the bullet holes in the coat.
The one in the back is not disputed, but
in regard to the other two there Is evi
dence that the autopsy physician maybe
wrong in his diagnosis that the bullet en
tering the back ranged upward and came
out at the left shoulder. There are dis
tinct powder burns on the left lapel of the
coat, and the inner part of the cloth Is
ragged, showing that a bullet made its
entrance there, and not its exit. On the
right lapel of the coat there are similar
marks, but the burns are not so distinct.
It is therefore supposed that three bullets
entered Brancoli's body, but the autopsy
physician was only able to find one. It is
also supposed that as each shot was fired
Brancoli was backing away from Scatena.
which would account for the difference in
the condition of the powder burns.
After the case for the prosecution was
all in the defense asked for a continuance
till to-day to consider whether they
would bring forward any witnesses.

Supervisors Declare That the Evil Must
Be Destroyed in This City
at Once.
The gamblers of Ingleside have over
reached themselves. When they boasted
that they could corrupt the Board of Su
pervisors as they had bought former mv
. nlclpal authorities they called forth a
storm of just indignation. The Supervis
ors declare, without exception, that full
justice shall be done to the people of the
city, and that no technical subterfuge
shall prevent the operation of the law,
which has been Introduced and will be
adopted, to kill the evil which is corrupt
ing San Francisco.
Before the gamblers made their boast
that the present Board of Supervisors
could be influenced there was a disposi
tion on the part of a minority to restrict
the evil of Ingleside rather than destroy
it. The assertion of the gamblers that
they would win their disreputable fight
â  by dishonorable means has had the wel
come effect of crystallizingsentlment upon
one purpose. The Supervisors are deter
mined now to kill the evil of the race
course in this city rather than temporize
with it.
When the gamblers of the racecourse
began their struggle to save Ingleside
from' municipal interference they knew
that they had the best elements of the
city to battle against. Men and women
of . cry class in the community were
arrayed against the racecourse. They j
needed only the inspiration of an official
action to unite and work. The track and ;
its attendant evils had done such incal
culable harm to San Francisco that all
classes were eager to begin a crusade of
suppression. The gamblers thoroughly
understood this fact and they chose what I
they thought to be their craftiest subter- ;
â  fuge.
They declared that they were uncon- 1
cerned over the action of the Supervisors, j
The municipal authorities could do what i
they pleased, so the gamblers of the race- !
course announced. They said they would
go, bag and baggage, to Oakland, where
they would ply their disreputable trade
a? allies and confederates of the Alameda
gamblers. This assertion was made and j
advanced simply as a trick. The Ingle
side contingent at that very time were :
scheming to destroy legislation that had j
been enacted against them.
Conferences were held and several ay- j
enues toward success were suggested.
1 The gamblers determined to buy immu
-1 nity, as they claim they have bought it j
before from the authorities of San
I Francisco. Profess! bribers were con- j
' suited and a plan of campaign was out
.lined. It is known that several of the \
most notorious manipulators of Ingleside
met and conferred with Sam Rainey at
the Palace Hotel. The purpose of the â¢
conference Is patent. The meeting took
:>!ace after the Board of Supervisors
passed theirprohlbitory resolution Monday
night. The gamblers had only one object
ln consulting the politician and middle
man.
Not satisfied with this endeavor, and
determined to leave undone nothing that !
might contribute toward success, the
gamblers of ingleside consulted Chris
Buckley. The Call has exposed the mean
ing of this meeting. A public duty de- ;
manded a plain statement of facts. The i
I result was not unexpected. The expose of .
the'gamblers' scheme cheated the manip- j
lajors of success. The Board of Super- j
visors was justly indignant and the peo
ple of the city were made aware of the
plot that had oeen batched by the mas
ters of the racecourse. The Supervisors
declare tnat no "golden eloquence" will
have power to interrupt the course of the
legislation that means so much for the j
welfare of San Francisco. i
Having failed in two of their plans the
racing blacklegs have advanced another.
hey declare that the prohibitory legisla- j
tion aimed against their criminal practices
is designed to aid a project for the estab
lishment of a. race course In San Mateo
county. It is said that bookmaking and
noolselling are to be placed under the
C a - in San Francisco in order that a pro
i-cted race course in San Mateo County
may have a clear field for the patronage
of the deluded men and women who are
reaping now a harvest of shame and dis
tress at Ingleside. It is asserted that A.
j. "spreckels Is Interested In this phan
tom" project of San Mateo County, and
that the Supervisors of this city have
come to his support.
Mr Spreckels denounces this assertion
unces this assertion
as an unqualified falsehood uttered by
the horse gamblers to aid them In their
disreputable cause. "I have in San Mateo
County." said Mr. Spreckels last night,
"no property interests that are affected
by the new ordinance of the Supervisors, ;
i "have never considered the idea of build
ing a iace track In San Matec County or j
In any other county, and have not the re- j
motest thought of doing so. I am con- j
cerned neither in coursing nor racing in
San Mateo or anywhere else, and any as
sertion to the contrary is untrue."
It is probable that the racing gamblers
will- concoct some new scheme before
Monday to bolster their declining cause.
They will do their utmost to secure the
postponement of a final vote by the Su
pervisors; to secure a reference of the ,
â resolution to a committee, or In any way
to smother and finally kill the ordinance.
It is extremely unlikely, however, that |
th.o Supervisors will give a listening ear
to the gamblers. The majority are still ;
n unit In favor of the proposed law. Every |

effort to break them down has made them
more firmly set In their purpose. An in
terview with Supervisor Collins is typi
cal of the opinions of the majority of the
board.
"I voted for the total abolition of the
pool-selling at Ingleside and elsewhere In
this county." he said yesterday, "and will
so vote next Monday. I think nobody can
get away from the fact that the whole
sale betting on races as is done at the
present time is working an awful injury
to the public. Old and young of both
sexes have caught the craze to an alarm
ing extent and are wild to wager their
money. Jt Is time to call a halt to this
species of gambling that is driving so
many to ruin. 'Following the ponies,' as
I believe it is called, is rushing a large
number of young men and boys toward
crime. I believe, and I feel that upon
this Board of Supervisors devolves the
duty to abolish horseracing.
"As for those vile places in the back
streets of this city known as 'pool rooms.'
I am for their total extinction first, last
and all the time, now and forever. I
would not dare to show my face in public
if I voted for anything short of the com
plete abolition of such disreputable
places. They are frequented and support
ed principally by men who never nave
more than a dollar in their pocket at one
time, and by boys whose capital seldom
reaches more than 25 cents. So upon these
poor patrons the pool rooms live.
"I don't think there will be any change
In the vote next Monday, for I believe a
good majority of the board, if not all of
the members, are determined to abolish
the whole business altogether. However,
I suppose the racing people will move
down into San Mateo County, but we will
at least settle the matter here."

ITS YOKE AGAINST THE TRACK
Â§ Resolved by the San Francisco Labor Council in regular session %

jÂ£ a letter to the Board of Supervisors commending its action in pass- c ;
H ing to print a resolution calculated to put a stop to the open gam- Â£>

Â§The foregoing resolution was unanimously adopted at the meeting of the Â£
â¢3 Labor Council last night: : : â¢ i$
& Thursday night the Building Trades Council openly condemned the race- Â£>
Â« track's notorious adjuncts, the bookmaker's stand and the city poolrooms. 55
Â« Last night the other central labor body took a similar but stronger action. o
<0> The matter was first called to the attention of the council by Walter Goff Â»3
Â£8 of Carpenters' Union 453. He made a brief speech in which he mentioned g
3 the action of the Supervisors as most commendable, and suggested that the g
*Â° council, as a representative body of workingmen, take some action. c 9
8 Mr. Goff was followed by Walter J. Macarthur of the Coast Seamen's Â£
g Union. Mr. Macarthur briefly mentioned the evils of the racetrack, and c.
g supplemented his remarks with the introduction of the resolution and moved Â»
Â« its adoption. It was seconded by M. Monahon of the Typographical Union. |?
Â£â¢ One delegate after another took the floor. All expressed themselves as unal- O
8 terably opposed to horse racing as at present conducted in this city, and ex- Â«!
S3 pressed the hope that It would one day be a thing of the past and could be *?
P looked upon as a horrible nightmare. There was a little objection to the reso- *Â»
** lution, some of the members thinking that it was not a proper matter for \*
P the council to consider. Messrs. Macarthur, Phillips and Rosenberg an- g
â¢" swered these objections. They said that the Supervisors were elected by &
3 the people. The council represented the working people and had a perfect Â£
$ right to express Its approval of any good action taken by the Supervisors, â¢
oS "Why," said Mr. Macarthur, "for all you know your wives and children Â£>
rt may be spending your hard-earned dollars unknown to you In the pool rooms |*

SOUSA VS. WAGNER
A Novel Concert at the
California.
THE music of Richard Wagner is
hardly as popular as that of John
Philip Sousa, judging from the mod
erate sized audience that turned out
for the Wagner programme last night and
the tremendous advance sale for to-night,
when an exclusively Sousa programme ;
will be played. Still. Wagner in his own ;
! little way is not an uninteresting com
poser and last night in the California Mr. :
â¢ Sousa stopped acting long enough to give
! excellent readings from many of the .
' master's music dramas. After each Wag
j ncr excerpt there was an encore, some
! times two or three, usually a Sousa
march or something of equal lightness
and dash. So there was music to please
everybodyâ the long haired and the short.
Mr. Sousa danced, pranced and gestic
ulated as usual in the light music. His
personal capers have become a part of the
Sousa marches. We all watch and wait
for them-that Is, all of us except the
bandsmen themselves, who seem to make
a specialty of looking the other way and
blowing straight ahead in legitimate busi
ness-like fashion. But In the Wagner
music Mr. Sousa did not beat the air in
vain and wonderful diagrams. He em
ployed none of his secret signals and wig
wagged not a bit. He directed with mod
! eration and dignity, and drew from that \
! perfect band of his a thrilling perform- '_
'â  ance of the "Gotterdammerung" funeral ,
: march, of the procession of the Knights
of the Holy Grail In "Parsifal" and of
the "Tannhauser" overture. Not since ,
the old days when John Philip played at
the Midwinter Fair have we heard such
good Wagner on a wind band. Miss
Maud Reese Davis sang "Elsa's Dream, .
' from "Lohengrin," in a nice, cool, in
; genue wav, and Miss Dorothy Hoyle gave
another example of her excellent violin
playing In the Wilhelmj arrangement of j
the "Prize Song." Altogether the concert .
I was unique and entertaining. There will
i be a bigger crowd at the matinee to-day ;
i to hear the "ballroom and dancing class
i programme," and a still bigger crowd to

Quick Trip From Alaska.
The codlishlng schooner Winchester
i made the run from Sannak, one of the
j Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to San Fran
; Cisco in the remarkably short time of
twelve days. She left this port on Jan
, vary 3 last, bound for Sannak, and made
i the run to the Shumagin Islands in twen
j ty-one days. Owing to strong northwest
erly gales, she had to seek anchorage at
â  Sand Point, where she remained six days
i under very stormy and alarming condi
tions, holding ground by means of three
anchors and all available chain; yet the
vessel dragged and nearly went ashore.
I As soon as the weather moderated she
proceeded to Sannak, where she arrived
! February 10. On this island the Alaska
| Codfish Company maintains two cod
fishing stations, which were in charge of
Captain Carlson, ho was the skipper of
the schooner Mary and Ida, one of the
company's fleet. The two captains re
spectively of the Winchester and Mary
and Ida started on a tramp to one of the
company's adjoining stations. Captain
Carlson was attacked with heart failure
and died on the road, where he was buried
with appropriate nautical ceremonies by
the crews of both vessels. The Win
"chester is unloading at this port a full
cargo of new codfish, and as it has been
out of the water less than a month the
fish is remarkably white, and it is prob
j ably the first time that a cargo of cod
fish has been landed in San Francisco In
â¢ such a short time after having been taken
I from the sea. This fact makes it most
i desirable for lovers of good fish, espe
j cially those who are adhering to the re
quirements of the Lenten season. The
Winchester will sail again to the cod
fishing station of Sannak on the 15th inst.,
and is expected to return to this port
about May 1, when the San Francisco
gourmets will again have a treat of new
codfish. The Alaska Codfish Company
expects to chronicle the arrival of new
codfish every sixty days, and thus prevent

threatened with a few days ago.

D. D. FOWLER
DISINHERITS
HIS WIDOW
A Lawsuit to Engage
His Heirs.
REASON IS NOW UNKNOWN
A CONTEST TO HIS WILL IS
BEADY FOB FILING.
The Document Was Drawn Five Days
Prior to Fowler's Death and Of
fered for Probate the Day
After.
When D. D. Fowler, a well-known min
ing man, who resided at 634 Polk street,
died on the 9th Inst, he left besides many
desirable legacies a rich opportunity for
bitter litigation. This has been seized
by Ella Fowler, decedent's widow, and
ln consequence the Fowler will contest
may eventually be numbered among the
most bitter ln the annals of local litiga
tion. Mrs. Fowler was disinherited by
her husband for some unknown cause
that is, unknown to the worldâ when
the story comes to light during the trial
of the contest it will doubtless be dra
matically interesting.
Fowler was an old man, having passed
his seventieth year, and was worth about
$200,000. For some time before his death
he was broken in health and it is said
even unable to transact business of the
most simple character. As an instance
of this disability it is stated that a few
days before dissolution he was asked to
indorse two checks, but the pen fell from
his nerveless fingers. Thursday he be
came weaker and just as the night fell
passed away.
Yesterday morning early a document
purporting to be the last will of the de
ceased was presented for probate. It
bears date of March 5, 1899, showing that
it was drawn just four days before the
old man died, and disposes of the estate
as follows: To Lizzie Fowler, a daugh- i
ter. $.000; to another daughter, whose I
name was not mentioned, $2500; to two I
sons, F. D. and D. D. Fowler, $2500 each,
and to Mrs. William D. Farren $2500. The I
residue of the estate was left to dece
dent's children, share and share alike.
The testator's widow was cut off with
out a cent. D. Farren and E. Groeneu
dyke were named as executors.
Farren offered the will for probate and
immediately appeared before Judge Cof
fey with an application for letters of ad
ministration. William A. Beatty of the
firm of Shortridge, Beatty & Brittan, was
present, however, and contested the is
suance of the letters on the ground that
a contest to the will would shortly be
filed by the widow. The contest will set ,
forth that the document was executed un- \
der duress and the undue influence of _.r. j
and Mrs. Farren. It will also be averred
that Fowler was Insane for' some time
prior to his death and consequently un
able to make a legal will; that while in
this condition he was influenced to make
the document, and for these reasons the
dead man's widow will go into court and
battle for a portion of the wealth he left
to his children and strangers to her ex
clusion. â¢
According to the story of the proponents
of the will the marriage of the couple
occurred at San Rafael about sixteen
months ago and the estate Is separate
property. It is said that in the latter
part of last year the wife caused her
husband to be arrested on a charge of
Insanity and had him taken before the
Commissioners of Lunacy, who, upon ex
amination, declared him perfectly sane and
ordered his immediate release. He was i
then taken by his friends to St. Luke's
Hospital, since which time he has lived
apart from his wife.
About a month ago Mrs. Fowler, ac
cording to Attorney Hassett. represent
ing the executor, sued for support, and
three days before his death she caused
the Sheriff to forcibly break in the door
of the room where he was living at the
house of Mr. Farren and had him served
with the summons and complaint in the
suit. The family difficulties appear to
have been due to money matters entirely.
M. Burdick's Death.
Detectives Gibson, Wren and McMahon,
after careful investigation into the death
of M. Burdick, the old man from Tomales,
in the Commercial Hotel from gas, are
i satisfied 'that it was accidental and that
! there is not the slightest foundation for
1 the rumors that he was robbed. He was
I known in Tomales as a "bum," and had
I not done any work for three or four
years. Silvio Capella, saloon-keeper on
Montgomery avenue and Jackson street,
i saw the old man leave his saloon and
' â watched him enter the Commercial Hotel
! between S and 9 o'clock on Wednesday
! night, and the night clerk in the hotel
saw him go upstairs to his bedroom.
I There was no truth in the report that two
I men were with him. All that was found
| in his trunk were an old coat, three dirty
I pairs of socks, an old pair of boots and
some shells in a cigar case.

Warner's Safe Cure the Victor
Among Modern Medicines.
It was once believed that a finger ring made from a coffin nail would
cure epilepsy. The tooth of a soldier who had been .killed in battle was regarded
as a remedy for toothaches. Imagine such ghastly nonsense as this parad-
ing as medical science! Tet the human mind, like the human body, must
creep before it can walk. In time men learned to reason and medicine was
put upon a rational basis. Back in the old days, some childish or disgusting
mess would have been used to relieve indigestion. Mark the progress Illus-
trated in this letter from J. E. Stockwell of Lincoln, Neb.:
"I have been badly affected with trouble of the stomach and have used
nearly all kinds of medicines and doctored with local physicians to no avail.
After being almost completely discouraged, I was advised to use Warner's
Safe Cure, which I did, and I am glad to be able to say that it is the only '
remedy that has done me any good. I have used three bottles and am
.feeling like a new man all over. I am thankful to the Warner's Safe Cure
Company for their medicine, and can recommend it cheerfully to those suf-
fering as I have suffered."
Another Instance of the victory of rational medicine is afforded by Jacob
Cramp of Birdsboro, Berks County. Pa., who wrote. May 10, 1898:
"I have taken five bottles of Warner's Safe Cure. It relieved me of the *
pain over my kidneys. When I got down I could hardly get' up again. I
did not know what was wrong with me. I could hardly do my work. I
heard of Safe Cure and thought I would try It. After taking one bottle I
felt better. lam very grateful for Warner's Safe Cure and would advise
people to try It."
Just one case more. Averett Perry, of Louisburg. N. C, says:
"I have taken only one bottle of Warner's Safe Cure and it has done me
more good than anything else I ever took. I had an aching feeling in the pit of
my stomach. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I can
recommend Safe Cure as the finest medicine in the world."
Does the clear and energetic language of these men leave any doubt of
their sincerity? The stomach derangement spoken of is commonly associa-
ted with the approach of Brighfs disease. No painted Indian ever crept to
a settler's cabin more stealthily than Brighfs disease invades the body. A
dull white skin, tendency to perspire, indigestion and short breath give
warning of the enemy.
Lose neither time nor courage.' Take Warner's Safe Cure regularly, and
bear in mind that it has a record of twenty glorious years. It cures all ail-
ments of the kidneys, liver and bladder, including even the terrible disease
named for Dr. Bright. The road to health is open, If only you read the sign
board aright.

DRY GOODS BOOMING.
The New York Commercial says
"The dry goods trade is booming. : If any
proof of that statement is needed a visit among
Jobbers and manufacturers will at once furnish
It. it is almost impossible to And a merchant
who is not busy and who is not more than
satisfied with the present state of affairs.
"With the cutting-up trade spring business
Is at Its height, and the productive capacity
of most houses is overtaxed to meet the de
mand. The clothing and cloak and suit houses
have completed the hulk of their initial busi
ness, and the volume of this has been so much
larger than anticipated that they are forced
t.> place considerable duplicate orders for
piece goods at this date. Much difficulty Is
experienced in securing duplicate lots of
woolen and worsted men's wear and
dress goods in the primary market, since most
mills are now running upon fall lines. In
creased difficulty Is experienced ln obtaining
the best soiling lines of cottons and silks, be
cause of the oversold condition of mills. Ad
vanced prices are willingly paid by buyers
where desired deliveries are to be had. The
men's weai woolen, the clothing and the knit
goods trades are rent with rumors of combines,
some of which are seemingly assuming definite
shape. -The operations of' buyers are only
slightly influenced by these movements, since
they are accompanied by the statement that
the" promoters have no intention of advancing
prices of finished goods."
DRIED FRUIT IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial Fays:
"With a steady though only quiet demand
for about all varieties of dried fruits there is
much in the situation that indicates improve
ment. The outlook is sufficiently encouraging
to warrant holding all supplies at high figures.
Conditions are promising, though at present no
especial change is noted. There is a steady
call for at>out all varieties of California dried
fruits, and prices are held firm on all, but
aside from that the market presents no fea
tures. Prunes are meeting a fair request at
steady prices. The pool of Oregon goods holds
prices steady on them, and California- are
in such short supply that the market remains
steady, with upward tendency. Supplies on
the coast are generally small, and the market
is firm at about 3%c basis for Santa Claras
and 3t33'ic asked for outside goods. On the
spot holdings are being rapidly reduced, and
prices remain firm in consequence.
"Peaches ire firm, and there is a strong ad
vancing tendency, even though the highest
prices known in years are ruling. Holders are
not especially anxious to make sales, even at
present high rates, and movement is restrict
ed in consequence. But there is no question
about the ultimate consumption of everything
obtainable, and some dealers say there is lit
tle ieason to doubt a further Increase in prices
as spring demand increases.
"Apricots are much reduced on the spot, and
few further supplies are obtainable on the
coast from first hands. Prices are firm at
the previously reported high range, but there
are indications that they will advance In the
next few weeks. Dealers are so confident of
this that they are refusing any concessions to
influence trade, and expect to compel buyers
to pay their prices."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 10.â The movement of
stock prices to-day was irregular, prices gen
erally being fractionally off, while some no
table advances were recorded among the
specialties. Local traction stocks were buoy
ont on the Idea that the action of the State
Senate yesterday diminished the chance of
hostile legislation in restricting the use of
Amsterdam avenue, which would particularly
affect Third Avenue, which rose an extreme
of twelve points, while Metropluan Street Rail
way rose nearly as much. Among the other
specialties to display strength were Tobacco,
American Steel and Wire, People's Gas, Ameri
can Spirits, Standard Distributing, Consoli
dated Gas, Brooklyn Transit. Âew York Air
brake, American Tinplate, Cotton Oil and Ten
nessee Coal and Iron, although the full gains
were not maintained. The railway and some
other standard stocks sagged slightly for lack
of attention. On the announcement that a divi
der..] of 1% per cent had been declared on
Union Pacific- preferred the stock eased, it
having boon previously falsely rumored on the
board that the disbursement was 2 per cent.
In the early dealings London was the princi
pal seller, while in the afternoon' selling ap
peared for both accounts on prognostications
that there would be another heavy decrease In
the surplus reserve in to-morrow's bank state
ment, but prophesies as to the bank state
ment based on the known data of Friday have
often of late proved misleading. The action
of the day's market seemed to show that the
specialties were pre-eminently In favor with
the professional element. The early dealings
were featured by an almost entirely concen
trated Interest in the highly priced stocks,
which moved in a sensational manner. The
standard stocks trailed along somewhat sympa
thetically, but soon developed a yielding ten
dency. In the late session Interest shifted In
the low priced specialties, which had not
moved proportionately with the rise in the in
dustrial division In the morning. In the last
hour's trading, following Union Pacific, the
market was of an exceptionally uninteresting
character, scarcely any Interest being mani
fested in the movement of prices. The clos
ing was dull.
Bonds moved somewhat hesitatingly to-day,
some active lines working upward, while others
yielded in sympathy with stock Influences
Total sales. $3,375, 000. United States new fours

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, March 10.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Although the
volume of transactions at the Stock Exchange
1 this week suffers by comparison with recent
ones there was In the main renewed exhibition
I of bullish speculation, which, however, had
, many signs of manipulative origin. The an
: thracite coal stocks were the chief features
i and the objects of the principal activity on the
, part of the large interests, and while some
of the industrials and specialties were promi-
I nent in the trading the standard railroad stocks
i seemed to be comparatively neglected. In
: de.-ci. while realizing sales became more abun
j dant as the week drew to its close, the pro
cess was somewhat accelerated on Thursday by
' the fact that the St. Paul directors on that
1 day made no change in the half-yearly divi
dend rate of 2% per cent and that indications
i were considered unfavorable to any increase of |
â¢ the 1% per cent semi-annual rate on Union Pa
cific preferred. It might be observed, how- J
ever, that on Wednesday last the absence of j
i any change in the American Sugar Company's
â  dividendâ the directors declaring the usual 3
per cent on the quarter on the common stock â
temporarily postponed the tendency to liquidate
; and in the opinion of the street at large
checked a disposition on the part of the in
dustrial stocks to break, which it was expected
I would ensue had the Sugar dividend been
I passed or even reduced. As already Indicated
professional leadership was responsible for the
more important movements in the list, and
though there were reports that the sharp up
ward spurt In the coal stocks was encouraged
by powerful Inside interests, who based their
action on the pending announcement of im
portant deals in connection with the anthra
cite trade and the corporations engaged in It,
there was ample ground on which to form the
' conclusion that operations by manipulative
; operators were even more effective. The part
1 which the public, acting through commission
. houses, has played in the movement has been
one of decreased importance. judging from the
activity of such interests, though there is no
apparent disposition to liquidate and profit
taking sales are conducted so leisurely that
the bear traders met with comparatively little
I success in hammering prices. > London's Inter
est In our market has been confined to a few
specialties.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK. March 10.â Bradstreefs to
morrow will say: Industrial and trade activity
; Is still a prominent feature of the general bust
; ness situation. Price strength, too, .is notable,
1 especially in view of the midwinter rise of Feb-
I ruary, except ln the case of the leading cereals
j and wool. In manufacturing lines the situa-
I tion is one of great activity. Additional ad
; vances ln wages announced this week eeem
j likely to swell the number of workers whose
I wages are reported advanced to close to 175,
--000. The Iron and steel trade Is still excited
by a feverish demand, inadequate supplies and
further advances in quotations. Shut-downs
for repairs and other reasons have reduced the
pig Iron output materially and current pro
duction is said to be considerably below that
: of January 1. The number of old furnaces be
; Ing furnished up and put in operation Is stead
â  ily increasing, but the effect as yet in pro
duction is not very marked. An easier ten
-1 dency in wool Is one of the disappointing feat
j ures of the week, the outgrowth particularly
I of unsatisfactory demand for men's wear goods,
j but also a reflection of reports of projected
I combinations in the finished goods trade.
Lumber Is active at most markets, and prices
are firm because of well cleaned up stocks. Raw
and refined sugar have alike moved upward, j
partly because of unfavorable Cuban crop ad
vices and also in sympathy with the improve- I
ment going on In European beet markets. Re
fined has been marked up, notwithstanding the
trade war now going on. Wheat is weaker,
notwithstanding crop damage reports, oriel other
cereals are in sympathy, chiefly because of the
growth of bearish views of supplies held by
farmers and a. tendency to discount the gener
ally expected heavy Government estimates of
wheat In farmers' hands.
Reports from leading markets East and West
are of an active spring jobbing demand, par
ticularly for dry goods, but shared ln by
clothing, shoes and other staples. On the Pa
cific Coast business is fairly good except at San
Francisco, - where general trade Is below the
average, owing to uncertainty regarding the
crops.
Wheat, including flour shipments for the week
aggregated 4,398,821 bushels against 5,815,585
! bushels last week: 4.484.761 bushels in the cor
responding week of 1898; 1,589,482 bushels In 1897
--2,401,209 bushels in 1896 and 2.791,416 bushels ln
1895.
Since July 1 this season the exports of wheat
aggregate 173.111.755 bushels against 168,941,514
bushels last year.
Business failures this week number 177, as
compared with ISO last week; 247 in this week
a year ago; 227 in 1897, 282 in 1896 and 262 in
1895.
' Failures for the week in the Dominion of
Canada number 37, as aginst 37 last week 31
in this week a year ago. 56 in 1897. 68 in 1896. !
and 39 In 1895.
KIN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, March 10.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
By far the best assurance of good business
in the future Is found in the good advances
of wages. The general rise in the earnings
of the cotton mill operatives, in most cases
10 per cent, and of Iron and steel workers,
generally 10 per cent, and tin plate and sheet
workers from 5 to 10 per cent, and of coal
miners in some large districts about as much,
has set a pace which most establishments will
follow which have reduced wages in the past
years of depression. Those who fall to com
prehend what such a change may mean have
only to consider that a 10 per cent increase In
the wages of all labor would put into the
markets a new buying demand. In amount
equal to about three-quarters of the entire
value of exports to all countries. The volume
of business shows no signs of decrease, and
lor - tha first full â  week -of March baa been
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAT.I., SATURDAY, IVIARCH 11. 1899.
about 51.7 per cent greater than the same
week Of Inst year and 61.7 per cent greater
than In the same week of last year, and 60.9
per cent greater than In 1892.
Most people would not expect | the produc
tion of pigiron to be affected by the weather.
Yet in the Pittsburg district alone the fur
naces running are said to have produced 13,000
tons per week ' less â¢ than their January out
put, so that the decrease In weekly produc
tion of all furnaces, 228,191 tons, March 1,
against 237,639 February 1. does not mean
anything more than bad weather. The shrink
age of supplies of Iron In February. Just when
increased supplies were expected and needed,
contributed much to the extraordinary advance
In prices, $2 75 In anthracite No. 1 February 1,
$2 50 In bessemer pig at Pittsburg, and $2 75
In gray forge. The unsold stocks also re
duced In February 46.431 tons, so that the ap
parent consumption was 977.979 tons in the
short month. Nearly all the work done, of
course, is at the comparatively low prices made
tn the great contracts three to four months
ago, but the few works which are still able to
' contract for early delivery are charging about
] what they please, and these quotations appear
in the published statements. In 'many cases
1 $1 to $5 per ton premium Is paid for delivery
! within sixty days. Plates are in special de
' mand and higher, but In - rails, bars and
structural forms the demand and prices are
1 not yet much changed. Tin is firm at $23 85,
I with a Consumption Of 2600 tons monthly, and
copper is scarce for spot at $17 75, with lead
j weaker at $4 'M. The trust refuses quotations
1 for tin plates. The demand for coke exceeds
the transporting capacity for the Connellsvllle
I region, but the output has been 168,679 tons
for the week, furnace being quoted at $1 60
, and foundry at $2 per ton.
The woolen manufacturer has been hampered
by doubts about the price of wool. Now a big
combination of worsted producers has been
I formed, with several other combinations pro
posed in goods of other kinds, but these do
not encourage buying and the season continues
I disappointing. In wool niantets the sales are
barely equal to the ordinary consumption of
| the mills dependent upon them and the prices
are rather weak
Exports of wheat do not yet fall below last
year's as many have for pome montns ex
pected, and Atlantic exports, flour included,
> have been for the week 3,390,402 bushels,
against 2,890,879 last year, and Pacific exports
603.107 bushels, again .t 1,280,618 last year, with
other exports of 407,669 bushels. Western re
; ceipts were 4,071,017 bushels, against 2.752,918
I lor the same week last year, and the output
from the country goes far to check appre
hension as to deficiency of the crop. The
price is about 2c lower for spot.
Failures for the week have been 182 In the
United States, against 248 last year, and 37
: | ln Canada, against 36 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 10.â The dominant factor
in the early news connected with the wheat
market was the liberal quantity shipped by
Argentine this Week. There was a contro
versy over the amount, one authority, placing
It at 2,032,000 bushels, another at 1.400.000. The
majority of traders accepted the statement
quoting the larger quantity. Liverpool re
ported a slight advance to begin with, but aa
It did not correspond with the gain here yea
terday it was Ignored. May opened %Â®%c
lower at 71%@71%c down to 71c. and with more
sellers than . buyers at the decline. Atlantic
port exports of wheat and flour equaled 689.000
bushels. Estimates ln the visible supply varied
considerably, some looking for 500,000 bushels
and others for that much decrease. The whole
market kept in mind that the Government re
port on farm reserves would . be issued ln the
afternoon, and It waa. assumed that tha total
would be the largest ever announced. The
nearer the market got to the Issuance of the
Agricultural Bureaus estimate the weaker the
prices became. Toward the end quotations ruled
quite heavy. May gradually declined, reaching
70%0 as the session ended There were, sellers
at 70%0 when the closing signal Bounded.

LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON. March 10.â There was j the usual
large attendance at the wool auction sales to
day. The offerings numbered 14.166 bales and
consisted of a good selection. A small supply
of scoured merinos sold briskly at an advance
of 6 per cent. Several lota of Russian greasy
were purchased by German buyers, while the
French buyers operated freely and largely In
cross-breds. There was active competition be
tween the Yorkshire and French buyers for
South African wool, which ruled dearer. The
majority, however, was taken by the conti
nent. The home buj-ers purchased largely of
American specialties.

Jacob Wollner's circular says:
"The Wool market seems to go from bad to
worse. There was a little wool selling last
week, but this week there Is nothing doing.
Eastern markets are reported quiet and con
siderably lower. It is hard to say what the
future will bring forth. It all hinges on the
woolen goods market, and as in former years
enough was placed for heavy weight goods in
the month of January.
"So far this year very little business has been
done in that line and the market cannot
change until manufacturers get orders for
goods. With the severe winter they have in
the East and with the small stock of heavy
woolen goods in the market, things ought to
have a different complexion. But with all raw
materials and other - industries booming all
over the United States, the wool trade Is In
this awful condition.
'â¢The London sales opened Tuesday with a
good attendance, with fine wools firm and
_.
strong.
"Some new wools have arrived In this mar
ket and show up pretty well considering the
dry season.
"On Saturday, the 4th inst., a meeting was
held by the California Wool Association to take
steps to have the Government open the forest
reservations for sheep on account of the
drought, especially in the southern part of the
State.
"A committee was appointed consisting of
Messrs. Jacob Woolner, B. F. Flint and E. H.
Trvon, which went to Sacramento to prevail
upon the Legislature to pass a Joint resolution
and telegraph to the President and Secretary
of the Interior, telling of the prevalence of the
drought and have the forest reservations in
this State opened for the season of 1899. ; â¢ . -_:
"The Legislature passed a resolution and
forwarded It. and the Governor and the chair
man of the State Central Committee telegraph
ed the existing state of affairs."

THE STOCK MARKET.
There was an active business In local securi
ties on the morning session. There were no
pronounced changes, though the sugar stocks
were firm. On the afternoon session Contra
Costa Water sold higher, but fell back, and
the sugar stocks were also easier.
Mining stocks opened firmer at prices above
those of the preceding day, but soon weakened
again, as will be seen. Trading was quiet. -

Season.

JINKS SHOWED OLD - TIME
FORM.
Caldwell Fancied Carter Harrison.
Andrisa a Likely Two-Year-Old.
Thorpe in Bad â Some
Favorites Won.
The last race on the card at Ingleside
yesterday, the seven furlong handicap,
was the most palpable exhibition of
"shoo-in" seen at the Corrigan track
this season. Rubicon, whose destinies are
looked after by Danny Lynch, of Shar
\ key-Fitzsimmons fame, was the medium
of the coup. The chestnut horse, with 114
pounds on his back, was backed down
from 8 to 5 to 4 to 5, the books being
besieged with coin. Meanwhile the odds
against all of the other starters receded
in the betting. Caldwell kindly gave the
big chestnut horse an excellent send
off at the post. With the others whistling
"down brakes." Rubicon won by himself.
O'Connell taking the place from Good
Hope. It was the most disgraceful farce
seen on a track for many moons. A blind
man, with a jute sack pulled down over
his head, could scarcely have failed to see
a glimmering of "something doing." On
the back stretch. Hal Brown was pulling
Good Hope up in plain view of ail, when
the filly could easily have taken the
lead, with her light impost of 84 pounds.'
\ Possibly it was hazy and the judges
;did- not perceive this piece of work.
; O'Connell could have gone to the front,
-or attempted it. but yesterday he was
rated. At the end the sprinter was full
of run. Olinthus. was left, and Sam Mc-
Keever ran as if a racetrack was foreign
to his nature.
â¢ The whoie affair was the joke of
the season in the betting ring. If the Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club, realizing that it
is on its last legs, intends to sanc
tion safe-cracking and all other forms of
robbery, it should so inform the public.
Races could then be doped accordingly.
The sport, if such it could be termed,
flavored of the unsavory from the begin
ning. Four favorites were successful, but
that is no indication of honesty. There
is one rider on whom the California rac- â¢
ing public will "bank"â Joe Piggott. He
did not suit the highly flavored tastes of
Starter Caldwell and the Ingleside outfit
and was suspended for getting left at the
post.
Corrigan's gelding. Carter H. Harrison
Jr., was a prohibitive, favorite for tne
opening scramble for maidens, with a big
field of fourteen starters. To make the
purse doubly sure Caldwell sent him away
four lengths in front, and he won under
wraps. Festoso, a 25 to 1 shot, secured
the place from Racebud.
A strong tip was out on W. B. Jennings'
filly Andrisa to win the two-year-old
scramble, and she performed the feat very
Impressively. Backed down to even mon
ey favoritism, Spencer, on the daughter
of St. Andrew, came with a rush the last
part, beating Tanobe out over a length. i
Bamboulia. a 20 to 1 shot, showed plenty
of speed, taking- the show.
The hurdle handicap fell to Our Cli- |
mate, carrying top weight. Honig's horse
receded in the- betting, and then won
easily from Tom Smith. The favorite,
Three Forks, dumped his rider on the !
back stretch. . __'Â._
Thorpe's handling of inciter, the Ito
- 2 choice, for the mile selling run, fourth
on the 'programme, would betoken the
"old man" to be In his dotage. On pounds
the best horse, he reached the wire in a
nicely timed finish, a head behind McFar
lane "the heavily piayeu second choice.
Pat Dunne's filly Jinks made a runaway
race of the fifth event at six furlongs.
Ruling equal choice in the ring with Pat
Morrissey, she won by half # a dozen
lengths. Morrissey. grotesquely ridden
by Thorpe, managed to take the place
from Rio Chico.
Track Notes.
The Crocker-Woolworth stake to be
decided this afternoon will probably re
sult in a grand fizzle. It is understood
"Buckwa will not be a starter, leaving it
a walk-over for The Bachelor.
Andrisa, the stable thinks, is a cracka
jack Spencer took her back before the
stretch was reached, and then won clev
erly. The filly is said to have worked
faster than Golden Rule. , _ â¢;-_. . ,
The suspension on Thursday of Jockey
Devin is' considered a great injustice to
the majority of race-goers.' He is only a
weight, and cannot be expected to
take the same care of a horse that an
older rider could. . Besides he was on a
rank "dog" in Glengaber, the gelding be
ing still a maiden.
Carter Harrison was pi Yen the race at
the start. About everything Corrigan
â tarts these days is accorded the same
treatment The' ex-ruler of Hawthorne
and the "Prince" must have attended a
love feast and smoked the pipe of .peace.

Mrs. Arbogast Not to Blame.
W. A. Botkin, who began suit for di
vorce from bis wife, Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kin. last Wednesday, is indignant at the
statement attributed to her t,hat
hi*? reason for seeking a legal separ
ation is in order that be may marry
Mrs Clara Arbogast. and intimating that
they have been on terms of undue friend
liness for a long time. Mr. Botkin stated
last night that an estrangement existed
between himself and his wife before he
ever knew Mrs.- Arbogast, and that the
aspersions cast upon that lady are unjust
and malicious and are the result of an
unworthy desire to injur.- a most estima
ble woman. Mr. Botkin said his acquain
tance with Mrs. Arbogast extended- over
a period of about two years; that their
acquaintance was simply one of friend
ship and their marriage has never been
contemplated, and that Mrs.- Arbogast is
in no way responsible tor his suit for di-
Torca.

GREAT COURSING EXPECTED.
Eastern Dogs Will Be Slipped With
Some of the Natives at Ingle
side Park To-Day.
The stake to be run at Ingleside Cours
ing Park commencing to-day filled with
seventy-two nominations, and in the
bunch of fliers are to be found some of
the best quality of greyhounds running
} on the coursing swards. '
The stake for the two days of coursing
i is open, and among the nominators will
! be found such old lovers of the leash as
T. Cronin, with no less than four dogs,
all of which have placed a snug sum to
the credit of their owner. Among the en
trants are such grand performers as
Thornhill. and Wild Tralee, a pair that
have won first money on several occasions
In the hottest kind of company. Mr. Cro
i nin has decided tb run all of his dogs at
Ingleside Park in the future. Mr. Keenan
has in the stake the old reliable trio-
Royal Buck, Flying Buck and Fear Not,
dogs that are never beaten in a "course
until the flag goes up. Lynch has got
two grand ones on the list, viz., Lottie
M and Mystic Maid. The latter bitch ran
in grand form on Sunday last, and when
right the dog that defeats her will cer
tainly know he has had a race. H. A.
Deckelman will have such noted perform
' er - as Flyaway, Old Glory. Rocket, Law
rence and Glen Chloe running. In this
stake they should go well into the money,
as in the hands of Trainer Geary these
dogs are always brought to slips in the
i pink of condition. There are a great
many cracks who will meet to-day, and it
: would be well for those attending the
meeting to be careful on giving much
- odds on the following races, viz.: Thad
Stevens vs. Minervaâ should be a
! good short end. Las Palmas vs. Flyaway
âFlyaway has got the speed, but should
I Las Palmas get placed on her game she
' is very dangerous, as she runs up a score
rapidly. Brutus vs. Lillle M-Wlll run
very close-. One of the hardest races of
! the card will be that between Thornhill
i and Royal Prize. They are both fast and
I rlever greyhounds, possessed of nearly
â an equal amount of speed. The two old
. '--^--diggers. Gladiator and Old Glory,
will meet again, and as they have on
Several occasions divided the honors the
' course to-day will be watched with much
' interest. The next pair are. the midgets

March being the great month for golf
ing at Del Monte several of our local
golfers have taken themselves and thel.
bags of clubs thitherâ among them E. J.
McCutchen and S. L. Abbott Jr., two of
the strongest players in the San Fran
cisco Golf Club. The links at Del Monte
are now in excellent condition.
On Friday morning, March 10, the la
dies' regular competition, eighteen holes
with handicap, for the Winslow medal,
was held. Next Saturday, March 18,
men's competitions in driving and ap
proaching will take place on the links of
the San Francisco Golf Club.
At Oakland this afternoon (Saturday,
March 11) there will be a competition for
men, match play, eighteen holes with
handicap, for a silver cup already in pos
session of the club. Next Saturday,
March IS, there will be putting and ap
proaching contests for ladles and gen
tlemen for silver medals.
The Oakland Golf Club has sent in an
application for membership in the United
States Golf Association. H. M. A. Miller,
secretary of- the club, leaves the State
shortly for a two . months visit to Old
Mexico. Â§Â£____
AMATEUR ATHLETES TALK.
Pacific Association Intends to Take
Jurisdiction Over Rowing
and Baseball.
At the meeting of the -Pacific Associa
tion of the Amateur Athletic Union the
following representatives were present: J.
R. Bockman of the Ariel Rowing Club
(in the chair), W. C. Espy of the Pioneers,
A. P. Rothkopf of the Dolphins, S. J.
Pembroke of the Alamedas, George James
of the Olympic Club, M. Breen of the
South End, H. A. Keeler of the Academic
League, P. D. Franklin of the University
of California and C. L. Neumiller of the
Stockton Athletic Association.
President J. R. Bockman, while admit
ting that the Amateur Athletic Union ex
ercises no jurisdiction over rowing, base
ball and football, expressed himself as
strongly in favor of the Pacific Athletic
Association assuming jurisdiction over
these sports, sfnee, if it does not do so, the â â 
rowing clubs, which form half the mem- !
bership of the association, would have
no reason for belonging to it. There is \
! already a movement on foot among some i
J of the rowing clubs to join the National I
Association Qf Amateur Oarsmen or to |
I form a new organization. A circular will ,
i be sent to the various rowing clubs on the
bay in San Diego, Oregon. Washington
' and British Columbia, asking each club
I to send three delegates to a conference,
at which the rowing men decide what will
best further the interests of that sport.
After considerable discussion, the presi
dent and secretary drew up an amend- j
ment to the constitution of the Pacific
Association, enumerating the sports over ;
which the association claims jurisdiction, j
Among these are rowing, baseball, indoor !
baseball, football and many others, j
Notices will be -ent out to-day to all clubs j
' in the association, so that the necessary
thirty days' notice may be given before ;
j the association holds its next meeting.
The association, in view of the confused j
condition in which cycling affairs now â 
' are has decided for the present to recog- j
I nize neither the League of American ,
; Wheelmen nor the California Associated
' Cycling Clubs. Cycling has been dropped
! from the list of intercollegiate sports, and
i so the sport does not concern the uni
versities except indirectly.
A question as to whether the Ariel Row- :
' Ine Club has two members on the board
of managers of the Pacific Association,
viz President J. R. Bockman and John
! i Nolan whereas all the other clubs have
| only one, was raised, but a decision was
i postponed. t \

TENNIS PLANS.
Some New Leagues to Foster the
Sport Among Young Players.
On the California Tennis Club courts j
this morning the racket wleldera of j
Boone's Academy. Berkeley, will play a j
series of matches to try out the candi
dates who wish to represent thair college t
in the Amateur Academic League cham- !
pionship tournament. This tournament !
will be one of the big tennis events of the
year and will be held some time next
m Sam Hardy is now arranging for an in
terscholastic championship tournament.
It is his idea to make it an annual affair
as well as the Pacific Coast championship
meet on the Fourth of July. Both the big
colleges Have expressed a willingness to
enter teams as Individual players. Any
student of a recognized institution of |
learning will be a qualified player. From !
present indications this association will
be formed and the initial tournament held j
this spring. '"_, â  _ ,- '

MAKING THE
FINAL VOWS
TO VOTERS
Oakland Turns Into a
Circus.
W W. CAMRON MAKES. REPLY
CANDIDATES APPEAR AT THE
THEATER.
Republicans to Wind Up With a Par
adeâlndependents Will Conclude
With Rally at the
Tabernacle.
'. â¦
' ' Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, March 10.
For' forty-eight hours Oakland will be
at a standstill as regards everything ex
cept politics. With sunrise on Monday
morning the pent-up volcano will begin
to erupt, and by midnight the results will
be known and the city will settle down to
business.
From oratory and the circulation â of
cards the campaign has now descended to
bell wagons and circulars. The Streets
to-day look like* a circus. The thinker
has been at work and many episodes that
candidates would fain have forgotten are
now being prominently exploited. No
matter whether true or not, this is the '
eleventh hour, and there is no time for
contradictions, consequently any ; flaring
statement that appears after this should
be received very cautiously and relied on
still less. -.-?â ="
W. W. Carrtron has made a reply to the
Statement of Councilman Girard regard
ing the incident which has rent in twain
the Second Ward. Mr. Camron says:
"Ever since I announced myself as a can
didate for Councilman there has been per
sistently and continuously circulated in
the interests of the candidacy of Mr. Gi
rard. for the same office, the most cow
ardly, scurrilous and scandalous reports
affecting my private and business life,
all of which were well known to be untrue
both by Mr. Girard and his friends. I do
not wish to conceal the fact that the cir
cular referred to in to-day's ("all was is
sued by my permission, and for justifiable
ends. The record shows that both Mr.
Girard and his attorney were present in
'court and that he had an opportunity to
have answered his wife and her witnesses,
but he did not then dispute the truth of
any of the allegations and the court found
that they were all true.
"I have been in many political fights be
fore, but this is the first time I have been
forced into a fight of this character. lam
and always have been, as my record
Fhows, in favor of decent politics. I even
quarreled with Mr. Girard over my efforts
to keep outside matters out of this cam
paign, but he would not cease."
The Democratic and Independent parties
did not hold any political meetings to
night. They were to have met at Thir
teenth avenue, but decided that they
could do'more politics by appearing at the
Acme benefit at the Macdonough Theater,
where they occupied boxes.
Mrs. Fannie M. Pugh, nominated by the
Prohibitionists for School Director, is still
a candidate. This lady polled the highest
Prohibition vote at the last State elec
tion, and has been induced to withdraw
her resignation from the city ticket.
To-morrow evening the Republican
campaign will close at Hamilton Hall
Prior to the meeting the uniformed corps
of the Young Men's Republican League
will parade. This evening the Republi
cans held a meeting at Hanson's Hall
West Oakland, and at Becker's Hall, in
the Sixth Ward. The Independents will
hold their final rally at the Tabernacle
to-morrow night.

GHOSTLY CIGARETTES MAKE
HIM CLIMB THE WALLS
OAKLAND, March 10.â delusive locally prohibited little cigarette has
claimed another victim, and the secret poisons that lurk within some
of the paper covered rolls have totally wrecked the mind of "W. T. Dar
nal, a telegraph operator, residing with his -parents at 941 Campbell
street. Darnal was taken to the Receiving Hospital this evening and placed'
in the insane ward. To-morrow morning he will be examined by the Lunacy
Commissioners, Drs. Selfridge and Tisdale. ;; r J-l
. The unfortunate man is 28 years, of age and he has been an inveterate
cigarette fiend, consuming a half dozen packages each day for a long time
past, and until he imagines the walls of his room contain shelves upon shelves,
filled with the little wicked paper covered weeds. Yesterday Dr. Selfrtdge
was called ln to attend the young man, but his services proved useless. At
night Darnal ' arises from his bed and attempts' to climb the walls of his bed
chamber in the hope of reaching his coveted cigarettes, and after hours of
fruitless efforts he would sink exhausted to the floor. S-'io^-.L - . "~
His condition to-night is such that there is little doubt that he will be
recommended for commitment to an Insane asylum. '

After writing this farewell upon a quar
ter-sheet advertising card and laying it
beside him. William Lyons, a motorman
on the Twenty-third avenue branch of the
Haywards electric line, sat down in one
corner of his car and sent two bullets into
his brain this afternoon. Â» â  _
Shortly after 5 o'clock Officer R. U. Mc-
Sorley discovered the motorman lying in
one corner of the car with blood rushing
from two bullet wounds just behind the
right ear. â¢_ -.- . -,
The dying man was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where Drs. Sanborn and
Horn found, after a thorough examina
tion, that one bullet had pierced the brain.
The other bullet was extracted, since it
had not penetrated over half an inch.
Mrs Lyons, who was immediately noti
fied at her Elmhurst home, was unable to
assign any cause for her husband s rash
act. Aside from statin? tha,t he appeared
in his usual' good spirits when he left
home this afternoon she was too much
grief-stricken to refer to tho sad occur
rence. The weapon used by Lyons was an
old-style 45-callber bulldog revolver that
had not been discharged for a long time.
Being on the late night runs he usually
carried this weapon for self-protection,
for it is -customary for him to run his car
without a conductor after passing Twen
ty-first street to its terminus at Twenty
seventh street. Lyons' rash act has
caused no end of surprise among tne offi
cials and employes of the Haywards line,
with whom he was a great favorite.
It lacked fifteen minutes of midnight
when Lyons breathed his last. Deceased
was a native of Canada, aged 51 years.
He was a member of Eden Lodge; F. and
A. M., of San Leandro. The inquest will
be held to-morrow night.
WAS MUSTERED OUT
AND WANTED TO DIE
EDWARD HOWATT ATTEMPTS
TO ' COMMIT SUICIDE.
Aimed to Blow His Brains Out, but
Kindly Interference' Results in
a Shoulder Wound.
Oakland Office San Francisco. Call,
908 Broadway, March 10.
Crazed with drink. Edward B. Howatt,
a soldier, aged 23 years, this afternoon at- '
tempted to commit suicide by the Smith & I
Wesson route, caliber 38, at Kohlmeyer's i
saloon, corner of Eighth and Washington
streets.
That his effort was not successful was
due' to the prompt action of George Cur
tis, who snatched the revolver just as the
would-be suicide pulled the trigger. The
bullet penetrated the left shoulder, and
Howatt dropped to the floor like a load ol
bricks.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital, ]
where Dr. Stratton found that the bullet I
went clear through the left shoulder. The I
missile, was afterward found in Howatt's :
shirt. The injured man lay apparently â¢
unconscious for nearly half an hour while
his wound was dressed.
Howatt received his discharge, from
Battery. E of the Third Artillery yester- i
day, and has been having a good time j
along the "cocktail route" since then.
Shortly after 4 o'clock .this afternoon he
stepped into Kohlmeyer's saloon in com- |
pany with George Curtis and William I
Britton and ordered several "steams." â 
Then he began to brood over some Im- |
aginary trouble and began weeping.
"We tried to console him," salt! Curtis !
to a reporter,* "but he wouldn't have it
that way. Then he pulled out his gun, !
remarking, 'Well, I might as well settle I
it all right here.' With that he raised j
his revolver and pointing It at his head
pulled the trigger just as I grabbed it. i
Had I not done this Howatt would have
been' dead by this time."
When Howatt had recovered sufficiently j
from the shock he opened his eyes and !
begged for his revolver, but the police had I
taken it away. He said he was sorry that
he had not finished the job and repri
manded Curtis for Interfering. When as
sured by Dr. Stratton that the wound was i
not fatal he replied: "Well, I hope to
God that I die. The grave is about the !
best place for a man to go to about this â¢
time. He refused to give any reason for j
his rash act. He demanded that his name
be withheld from publication, saying he j
could do as he pleased and that It was no- I
body's business.
When Howatt enlisted in the army he j
gave his residence as Forest Hill, and he |
was an iron molder by occupation. ;
It was afterward learned that Howatt
resides with his father, E. B. Howatt, on
Grove street, near Forty-fifth. The elder I
Howatt Is a motorman on the Grove
street line, and when seen to-night he :
stated: "My son came home last night ,
very much under the influence of liquor.
In fact, I think he must have been
drugged.- Any way I scolded him severely
for drinking, and this morning when he
got up he put on my clothes and overcoat
and went out, taking my revolver with
him. I do not know what possessed him
to make him want to die."
A good' Arabian horse can canter in the
desert for twenty-four hours In summer
and forty-eight hours In winter without
drinking. ' "

Fred Gutterson Takes
a Wife. â 
WEDDED A SISTER-IN-LAW
SHE WAS RECENTLY DIVORCED
FROM HIS BROTHER.
The Secret of a Suit Filed Last Fall
Made Clear by a Recent Trip
to the State of
Nevada.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 10.
The most interesting chronicle in mu
sical and social circles was received to
day when It became known that the
handsome divorcee, Mamie Gutterson, is a
wife once more. And to make the incident
more interesting, the lady married the
younger brother of the husband from
whom she was divorced last fall.
A little more than six months ago the
Guttersons lived in apparent happiness on
Sixteenth street. A. L. Gutterson was a
bank official in San Francisco and his wife
was a very popular singer. Mrs. Gutter
son's tastes were all musical and she was
naturally thrown into' the company of
Fred Gutterson, the younger brother of
her husband.
Oakland was shocked last August to
learn that A. L. Gutterson had brought
suit in this county for a divorce. The ut
most secrecy was observer and the case
was transferred to San Francisco. Some
time later a decree was greeted and the
public was not taken into the secret. Mrs.
Gutterson and her child moved to San
Francisco and lived out on Sacramento
street. Fred Gutterson, the younger
brother, Is a popular celloist of the Tivoli
Opera-house and lives ln San Francisco.
"W hen news was received that Mrs. Gut
terson had remarried and was still Mrs.
Gutterson it was supposed that a reunion
had been effected and that sue had wed
ded her former husband. â  â¢ V :
Even this could not have rÂ«wÂ»n done
within a year after the divorce, but there
is no such law in Nevada, and to that
State Mrs. Gutterson and her brother-in
law went. The records show that Fred S.
Gutterson was given a license at Reno on
February 25 to wed Mrs Marie Gutter
son, who is several years his senior.
On his return to his duties at the Tivoli
Fred Gutterson told his friends he had
taken unto himsele! a wife, but 'id not
inform them that he had married his sis
ter-in-law:. ' __â '. â â "'.'

FOURTH CONTEST UNDER WAY
PLATING FOR THE SIR GEORGE
NEWNES TROPHY.
At v the Close of the First Sitting the
Westerners Appear to Have
the Battle Well in
Hand.
Special Dispatch to .Th* Call.
NEW TORK, March 10.â For the fourth
time in the history of chess, players of
this country contested a match' on ten
boards against the best recognized players
of Great Britain. The series of contests
Is being played for a magnificent trophy
presented by Sir George Newnes, presi
dent of the British Chess Club, London.
The first match, in 1896, was won by the
Americans, but the second and third
matches, played in 1597 and 1898, were won
by the Britishers. b . f
The contest begun to-day was all the
more important because another victory
for the Britishers would have won for
them the trophy. ; Many metropolitan ex
perts were present in the assembly room
of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where
this end of the match was played, under
the auspices of the Brooklyn Chess Club.
There were at least. 400 persons present.
The players were seated on a big platform
facing the spectators, and above them
were appended ten giant chess boards
with movable pieces, and as soon as a
move *was made either in Brooklyn or at
the Hotel Cecil, London, where the match
is being played under the auspices of the
British Chess Club, It was repeated on
the giant boards to enable the spectators
to follow the progress of the game from
move to move. The operators and the
representatives of the press were placed
in a room adjoining the big hall, close to
the players. No time was lost in repeat
ing the moves for the press and specta
tors.
The pairing was arranged as follows:
United States. Great Britain.
Iâ H. N. Pillsbury..vs..J. H. Blackburn.
2â J. W. Showalter.,v_..H. E. Atkins.
3â F. Harry vs..T. E. Lawrence.
4â A. B. Hodges vs.-E. M. Jackson. .
Bâ Edward Byrnes... V3..D. Y. Mills.
6â H. G. Volght .vs.. Herbert Jacobs.
7â S. P. Johnston... vs.. D. Locock.
Bâ B. F. Marshall... vs.. E. YVainwrlght.
9â J. Newman vs..G. E. H. Belllnsham.
10â D. G. Balrd vs..H. W. Trenchard.
The even number players of the Ameri
can team had the first move, and the
i odd numbered players on the British side
j also played the white pieces.
Play began at 10 o'clock. After a few
| opening moves were made on all the
, boards it was ascertained that the open-
I lug and defenses conducted on all the
i boards were those as given In the pairing.
Pillsbury played a two knights defense
against Blackburn. The latter tried to
! force matters by an attack, but Pillsbury
was all there, and the positions remained
even when the game was adjourned after
thirty-two moves. â¢ ;,:.';--
On the second table Showalter played a
j Spanish game against Atkins. The latter
! selected a variation favored by Stelnitz.
i Eventually the Kentucklan seemed to get
j the position, and he kept it up to the
: time of adjournment, when thirty-two
I moves had been made. â¢
Another Ruy Lopez was played on the
| third table by Lawrence against Barry. |
â â  The Bostonian adopted the Berliner de- j
i fense and managed to get a fine game by â 
subsequent fine strategem. At the time
! of adjournment, and when Barry seated
his thirty-third move, the experts present
: thought he should win to-morrow.
Ruy Lopez No. 3 was played on the
fourth board. This time the champion
! of the Manhattan Chess Club, Hodges,
1 tried Spanish tactics against Jackson.
j The Englishman selected a flancheUe de
l fense made famous by Pillsbury. In the I
I course -of subsequent play the American j
! established a very fine position and when
the game was adjourned after twenty-six
moves Hodges was put down as a winner
â  to-morrow.
Hymes, on the fifth table, had also to
i contend against a Lopez against the Scotch
. champion. Mills. The latter won a pawn
: and had slightly the better position. An
interesting end game is looked for on the
I resumption of play to-morrow. Thirty-
I seven moves were made in this game.
Jacobs, who played a center counter
! gambit against Volght, got the worst of :
i the struggle, and a win for the Ameri
! can player Is anticipated. In this game ]
i thirty-three moves were made.
On the seventh table still another Ruy
Lopez was played between Locock and
Johnson. In this game there were many
ups and downs. First one and then the
other seemed to have the advantage, and
just at the time of adjournment the
game was drawn after thirty-one moves.
Marshall, the youngest player on the
team, the champion of the Brooklyn
Chess Club, and one of the most promi
nent players of the metropolis, opened
with his favorite PQ4 against Wainwright
on the eighth table. Marshall played
a very brilliant game, and although he
weakened at" one stage of the contest he
managed to come out with a good posi
tion shortly before the adjournment.
Thirty-two moves were made in this
BJ Beliingham's Ruy Lopez on the ninth
board against Newman was a success.
Twenty-eight moves were made on this
b Â°On d the tenth table the Spanish game
was played by Baird against Trenchard.
At first the Britisher had decidedly the
better petition. In the middle-game
stage, however, the American played
good chess and evened up the position.
Thirty-three moves were recorded.
It will thus be seen that the chances
for the Americans to win the contest and
the trophy are very bright and only a mir
acle seems to be able to save the Brit
ishers from disaster to-morrow.
A BOY ABSCONDER
CAUGHT IN SANTA ROSA
OSCAR ANDERSON, CHARLES
NELSON'S CLERK, ARRESTED.
William Baker and Lorenzo Peterson,
His Two Accomplices, Are in
the "Tanks" Here.
Oscar Anderson, the boy clerk in the
employment of Charles Nelson, proprie
tor of lumber mills, was arrested yes
terday afternoon at Santa Rosa on a dis
patch from Captain Bohen and Detective
T. B. Gibson will bring him back to the
city to-day.;Â§Â»y^ :'.'.';;
About thr^s weeks ago Anderson was
sent to the Crocker- Woolworth Bank with
two checksâ to be paid to: Will tier,
Fuller & Co.. and the other, for $800, to be
disbursed ln paying the men on one of
Nelson's steam schooners. Anderson paid
the" check to Whittler, Fuller & Co., but
absconded with the $800 intended for the
crew. â¢ -- -~- *, Â»'â '.!. ''â%''' tv- : "V ? : 'â '-- â â _-".* ' K -^-*~ "
The police ascertained that the boy had
got into bad company and had been play
ing the races. He was induced to steal
the money by William Baker, alias
"Dutchy," a brother of the pugilist, and
Lorenzo Peterson. Warrants were sworn
out for the arrest of the trio and since
then Detectives Egan and T. B. Gibson
have 'been working on -the case. They
traced the trio ' from Pleasanton, where
Anderson posted Whittler,. Fuller & Co.'s
receipt to Nelson, and from there to Sac
ramento, Ukiah, Geyservllle, Windsor,
and finally to Santa" Rosa. They pur
chased a' road house a few miles out of
Santa Rosa and. Baker and Peterson came
to the city quietly to make arrangements
for running it. The detectives yesterday
morning found Baker and Peterson in the
Dunlap House and took, them to "the
tanks'* at the City Prison.
Captain Bohen then sent a dispatch to
Santa Rosa to arrest Anderson, who had
assumed 'the name of Edward .Stanley,
and received a reply that he was in jail
there.
SANTA ROSA, March 10.â Oscar Ander
son, a warm young sport, who struck
town about three weeks ago with his
pockets tilled with 20-dollar gold pieces
and who since that time has been set
ting quite a hot pace for the amateur
bloods of this city, was arrested here this
afternoon by Officer L.lndley and lodged
in the County Jail, charged with embez
zlement.
Anderson, during his spectacular, career
in this city, has been known as Edward
Stanley, and he blew in on the evening
of Washington's birthday in company
with three other kindred spirits, who
registered at the Grand Hotel as L. Pe
terson, A. Smith and William Baker. Ba
ker claimed to be a pugilist and the oth
ers stated they were horsemen employed
at Ingleside and were enjoying a vaca
tion.
The morning after their 'arrival the four
visited a local livery stable, where Ander
son hired four rigs and all started out
for a drive, Anderson paying the bill
with great flourish in advance. Upon- re
turning to town in the afternoon the
quartet visited the clothing establishment
of H. L,. Tripp, on Fourth street, where
the Croesus purchased his three friends
each a suit of clothes 'and complete out
fit. '
During his stay here until a few days
ago Anderson spent money like water
and a number of the fair sex will mourn
his sudden removal.
About a week ago he. became the pro
prietor of a local road house near the
outskirts of the city and a few days later
his three friends departed for sections
unknown. The arrest this afternoon was
upon the request' of Chief Lees of -San
Francisco. When arrested Anderson ad
mitted he was the man wanted and he
was at once taken to jail, where he
passed the night.
WAS MRS. JOHNSON
RAILROADED TO JAIL?
HABEAS CORPUS BRINGS TO
LIGHT STRANGE FAC-~^
Case of a Woman Who Was Never
Tried, -et Was Serving a Three
Mo iths' Sentence for
Vagrancy.
Mrs. Mary A. Johnson was released
from- the County Jail yesterday morning
on the order of Judge Murasky, and there
by rests a story past explaining. It is
evident that Mrs. Johnson was "railroad
ed" to prison; how is a mystery, but sub
sequent developments may clear this haze
away.
Mrs. Johnson Is the wife of John A.
Johnson, a marble cutter, employed at
Holy Cross Cemetery, and the mother of
five children. Husband and wife did not
live happily together of late, and last De
cember Johnson applied for a divorce,
alleging intemperance as a cause of ac
tion. She filed an answer denying the al
legation, and in a cross-complaint charged
her husband with extreme cruelty. A few
weeks 'ago Mrs. Johnson was arrested
while on her way to her home, 503 Edna
street, the officer who arrested her charg
ing her with being Intoxicated. She was
taken to the City Prison and from there to
the County Jail to serve a three months'
sentence for vagrancy.
No record of Mrs. Johnson having been
found guilty of vagrancy appears on the
Police Court records, yet the commitment
bears the signature of Judge Conlan.
Judge Conlan admits that the signature
on the commitment appears to be genuine,
but does not recollect that Mrs. Johnson
was eVer tried in his court.
Later Judge Conlan discovered that
Judge Graham' had been sitting in the
case in his absence.
Such being the facts. Assistant District
Attorney Soloman, when habeas corpus
proceedings on behalf of the prisoner were
taken up by Judge Murasky, admitted er
ror and said that- no earthly right existed
for the woman's commitment.
The District. Attorney's office and C. E.
Phillips,. Mrs. Johnson's lawyer, will make
a thorough investigation, and In the event
of evidence of any ."crookedness" center
ing on any official there is trouble in store
for him.
Money for the Tax Collector.
The Finance Committee of the Super
visors, at its meeting yesterday, allowed
Tax Collector Edward I. Sheehan $10,500
with which to conduct his office until the
end of the fiscal year inÂ»June. The latter
official has not as yet been able to esti
mate whether "the money will pay for all
the extra help required to handle the vol
ume of business that passes through the
office.

BILLY LAVIGNE SAVED HIS
BROTHER FROM A KNOCKOUT
Entered the Ring at a
Critical Time.
REPEATS M'VEY'S TRICK
REFEREE McDONALD THEN DE
CLARED SMITH WINNER.
Did Not Declare Bets Off, However,
Nor Take Notice of Smith's
Repeated Foul Tac
tics.
Filly Smith, "the Mysterious/.' was j
given a decision last evening at Wood- j
ward's Pavilion over "Kid" Lavigne In
the fourteenth round of what was to have
been a twenty-round contest. Jim Mc-
Donald, the baseball umpire, was referee.
Billy Jordan, master of ceremonies, an- j
nounce- before the contestants were or- j
dered to toe the scratch that the. fighters
had agreed to break clean, or in other
Words, not to hit in a clinch. The referee i
heard this announcement, but ho did not I
enforce the mandate. Smith had two very' I
decided advantages over his stocky op- i
ponent, viz.: Five inches in height and
three inches in the reach of arms.
The old saying that a good little man
cannot cope with a good big man was ful- j
ly exemplified ail through the mill. But j
although Lavigne has proven to be a won- j
der in several battles, it must be .-aid that
according to the display he gave last
evening in hitting and staying qualities j
he is fast on the retrograde. Smith made j
rio apparent endeavor to deliver to his cus- j
tomer any of the hard goods Which lie is
in possession of until the thirteenth round i
arrived. In fact, he toyed with Lavigne
for several rounds and let opportunities
pass. If he had taken advantage of these
the contest would have ended long before
the fourteenth round.
Smith has a record of sing foul tactics, i
end the thousands of people who wit-,
nessed tin mill will bear testimony to the
fact that he administered at least twenty
foul blows between the first round anil
tlie fifth round of the contest. Referee
McDonald cautioned him time and again
in the first and second rounds, but Smith |
laughed at the commands and continued
to hit in the clinches and smile at his I
seconds each time he committed a foul.
Cries from the gallery and pit of "Foul"
and "What is the referee there for?" were
numerous, but McDonald paid not the
least attention to the demands of "Get on j
to yourself. Jim!"
Smith continued to hit in the clinches
and finally Lavigne resorted to the same
trick when he was satisfied that the
referee would not pay any attention to'
the agreement which the fighters had en
tered into before the contest commenced.
Smith, as previously stated, could have

SACRIFICED LIFE
FOR HIS PATIENTS
DR. FREDERICK P. MUFFE, Who Died
Suddenly Yesterday at His Residence,
1211 Jackson Street.
HUNDREDS of friends of Dr. Frederick P. Muffe will regret to learn of his
sudden death yesterday. Seemingly in the best of health, the well-known
physician attended to his manifold duties on Wednesday and Wednesday
evening, but retired to his much-needed rest feeling the effects of over
work. Early yesterday morning he called to his wife to bring him some whisky
to sustain him. and then quietly fell back on his pillow dead. Dr. Perrault was
immediately called in, and found his fellow-practitioner at rest. Death was at
tributed by him to angina pectoris and overwork.
The news of Dr. Muff 's death has been a severe shock to all who knew him.
Many were aware that in- was suffering from too close attention to his patients,
and even warned him. but deceased was unable to disappoint his fellow-sufferers,
and his untimely death was due to sacrifices in their behalf.
A more kindly, generous and charitable man could hardly be found in his
profession. He was beloved by his patients, and unknowingly their selfish de
mands on his time proved his undoing. Working early and late, he ministered to
their needs, never murmuring, but gradually eking out his own life.
Had Dr. Muffe lived but two weeks longer he would have reached the age
of 50. His was a busy life. After completing his medical studies in the University
of New York, he entered the Bellevue Medical College of that city and graduated,
and then entered the army as surgeon. For years he occupied an honored position
under Uncle Sam. In 1886 he resigned and opened an office at 425 Kearny street, at
which place he practiced until death closed his busy life.
The deceased was connected with many fraternal organizations. He was past
president of the California Schuetzen Club, a member of the Masonic order, the
Odd Fellows and the Red Men, and was also chairman of the executive com
mittee of the German-American Club. He was a prominent Republican and did
good work for his party during the past campaign. It is said he was to have
received the next appointment on the Health Board from Governor Gage.
Dr. Muffe leaves a widow and two children to mourn his untimely taking off.
His daughter, Mrs. Baum of Fort Bragg, was notified of his death.
The funeral will take place to-morrow at 10 o'clock from his late residence.
1211 Jackson street, and the cortege will then proceed to the Masonic Temple,
where services will be held. The remains will be cremated at Odd Fellows' Cem
etery.

L,avigne's brother Billy came to the res

cocted in the East by Mc\ ey, Corbett.

has been using fouling tactics all the
evening, and I will not stand for the gaff
any longer."
McDonald, because of the fact that a
second of Lav:-: entered the ring with
the intention of saving the "Kid" from a
knockout, decided the contest in favor of
Smith, much to the disgust of a large
number of observers, who desired to know
why McDonald did not decide in favor of
Lavigne when Smith repeatedly trans
gressed the rules by using foul tactics in
the early rounds of the gam- .
The question at Issue is, How many
times will it become necessary for a
fighter to commit a transgression of the
rules to satisfy a referee that a decision
against the transgressor is absolutely
necessary?
The fight was practically uninteresting.
Smith can whip the "has-been" Lavigne
in five rounds at any time he desires to
open up his guns of war. When Billy
Lavigne entered the ring apparently to
save his brother from a knock-out. neither
man suffered much damage, although La
vigne appeared to be a bit groggy.
Doubtless the McVey scheme of jump
ing into the ring purposely to save a
good friend and at a supposed critical
moment will be introduced again on this
coast before a stop will be put to hippo
d-or-p boxing contests in the Golden
West.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,' SATURDAY, MARCH 11, 1899.
Smith and Lavigne entered the ring
simultaneously at 9:17 p. m. Smith's sec
onds were Alec Greggains, Tim McGrath
and one Hennessy. Lavigne was esquired
by his brother Billy, "Young Mitchell,"
Teddy Alexander and Arthur Walker.
Jim McDonald, the popular baseball um
pire, acted as referee. Smith weighed
exactly 142 pounds, and Lavigne about
13.5. Announcer Jordan Introduced the
men ami read a telegram from Tom
O'Rourke stating that Joe Walcott woulo
fight the winner for a purse and a side j
bet of $5000. , ;;
Billy Lavigne objected to some band
ages which Smith had on his left wrist
and insisted that they be removed, They
had an animated discussion about it. but ,
George Lavigne finally decided it by say
ing that Smith could wear all the band
ages he' wanted. -- â 'â ''.-:
The men agreed to break away clean,
without hitting in the clinches. It was
exactly 9:30 when the battle commenced.
In the first round, after some prelimi
nary fiddling Smith was the first to lead.
Both ran into a clinch, smashing their
rights into the ribs. Lavigne tried hi_
right for the head and Smith clinched.
Smith feinted and they clinched again.
Lavigne landed a hard left on the head
and after they had clinched Smith threw
his right hard into the body, the crowd
veiling "Foul," as the men had agreed
not to hit in clinches. Lavigne swung
his left hard on the head and Smith
thumped him twice in the ribs after the
clinch, raising another cry of "Foul. Tin
referee warned Smith repeatedly to de
sist hitting in the clinches. Lavigne
rushed, without damage. and then,
straightened out his left, landing slightly
on the head.
Between the first and second rounds
Referee McDonald talked to Smith, warn
ing him not to hit in the clinches. Smith
opened the second with a stiff right on the
head. In the succeeding clinch Smith
resumed his old tactics of hitting and was
roundly hissed. Lavigne essayed a rush,
landing his right in the side. Smith tried
a vicious right for the head and missed, j
Lavigne drove his right hard into the ;
face and Smith swung his right into the
"Kid's" body after they had clinched.
Lavigne rushed in, landing his left on the
head, and Smith clinched without strik
ing back. Smith blocked a vicious left
and Lavigne missed with his left for the
head, clinching and receiving another of
Smith's foul blows in the ribs. The ref
eree again warned Smith. Lavigne landed
a terrific right in the ribs. They rushed
Into a clinch as the gong sounded.
Lavigne opened the third round with a
light left in the face. This made Smith
mad and he came back, but fell short. j

were too close to do damage.
Lavigne opened the sixth with an inef
fective rush. He ducked from Smith's
vicious right, but received it a second
later hard on the neck. Smith got in with
left and right hard on the body, and
rushed the Kid to the ropes, landing his
left on the body. He tried his right for

neck and the latter clinched. Lavigne
placed a hard right on Smith's shoulder
and -Other in the ribs. He rushed
Smith, missing with a left swing, but
landing his right, on the bo.lv. They
clinched and Smith hit him. raising the
usual cry of "Foul."
Smith opened the seventh round with a
rush, throwing his elbow into Lavigne's
face as they clinched. Lavigne rushed
and Smith smothered the effort. Smith
landed hard in the face and tried a right
uppercut, which was a mile short La
vigne landed a hard left in the face and
Smith came back with his left in the
body. Smith hit him in the ensuing
clinch, and everybody saw it but the ref
eree. Smith blocked a straight left and
received a hard right on the head. La
vigne planted another hard left in the
face without return. Lavigne rushed
Smith to the ropes and they exchanged
straight lefts in the face. Smith rushed
and swung both hands hard for the body
but the Kid jumped away, getting in with
his left on the ribs as he did so.
In the eighth there was some clever
blocking and ducking at first. Smith hit
in the clinch again. Smith landed hard
in the mouth after the breakaway He
then threw his left into the ribs as La
vigne went around his neck with a right
swing. Lavigne landed light left on face
and jumped away as Smith essayed a
counter. Both ducked and blocked left
swings for the head. Lavigne rushed;
overreaching himself, falling against the
ropes. Smith followed him up and swung
his right, landing hard on the Kid's spine.
Lavigne clinched and came up laughing.
The ninth was the slowest round of the
fight. They rushed, clinched, ducked and
blocked without damage to either.
The pace was slower now, both men
being tired. From the tenth to the thir
teenth little of interest happened, an oc
casional stiff body blow relieving the
monotony.
The end came in a curious, way in the
fourteenth round. After several counters
and blocks Lavigne landed hard on the
head without a return. The blow warmed
up Smith, who came back at his antagon
ist swinging his left and right for the
head. He landed twice on the face and a
hard right on the jaw. The "Kid" reeled
as if nearly out, but essayed a weak rush
back, covering his jaw with his left hand.
Then his brother Billy jumped through
the ropes and threw his arm over the
"Kid's" shoulder, saving something to the
referee about Smith having fouled him
long enough, and led the "Kid" to his
corner. The referee awarded the fight to
Smith at once on Billy Lavigne's breach
of the rules in entering the ring. It was
plain, however, that the "Kid" would
have been put out by another good blow,
though the gong might have saved him,
as the round was almost over.
Lavigne had the best of it up to the
tenth round, after which Smith gained a
distinct lead. To many, however, it looked
as if Smith was holding back early in the
fight, and he surely did not employ ids
usual tactics of rushing, by which he has
wen many a fight. Smith's superior height
and reach were against Lavigne, how
ever, ami his confident air all through told
that he felt victory was in his grasp. If
Lavigne had pulled through the round he
might have kepi away and lasted the
limit; but the impression among ring
goers seemed to be- that Smith had him at
any stage. Lavigne went out of his class
to meet Smith, and this will teach him a
lesson in that respect.
Billy Otts succeeded in landing a pretty
right cross on Paddy Maloney's jaw in the.
third round of their fight and won the
preliminary bout of the evening. While
tin- fight lasted it was a pretty exhibition
of pluck and cleverness and was greatly
enjoyed by all present. Otts clearly had
the advantage in weight and reach and to
this may be attributed Maloney's defeat.
It is said that when the lads weighed in
Otts tipped the scales at IS." 1 , pounds, five
and a half over the weight agreed on by
both when articles were signed. On the
other hand Maloney weighed but 125%.
Despite this handicap Maloney went in
and put up a good fight while it lasted.
The first round was devoted to long dis
OFFICERS OF CHITOSE
ROYAL ENTERTAINERS
Captain Sakurai Extends the Hospitality of the
New Cruiser.
CAPTAIN SAKURAI and his officers
yesterday extended the hospitality of
his Imperial Japanese Majesty's ship
Chitose to the State and Federal of
ficers of California, the municipal officers
of San Francisco, the representatives of
the United States army and navy and to
the prominent citizens generally. It was
a gala day aboard the new cruiser, which
lay just off the Union Iron Works, within
the very shadow of her nativity as it
were. From the prow of the Chitose float
ed the national colors of Japan, the rising
sun upon the snow-white field, while from
the stern the flag of the royal Japanese
navy flapped defiantly in the wind.
The reception was from 2 to 5 o'clock,
and during that interval innumerable
tugs and launches were kept busy plying
tance sparring, a few blows being landed
by both without any damage. The second
fennel Otts on the aggressive, but every
attack he made was met by Maloney with
stinging lefts and rights. Otts nearly went
through the ropes in trying to avoid one
of Maloney's rushes.
The end came unexpectedly in the third
round. After fiddling for an opening Otts
led with his long left which Maloney neat
ly blocked, but Otts shot across his right
and landed flush on his opponent's jaw,
sending him to the floor. While Referee
Jim Neal counted he slowly arose to his
knees and on the ninth count reached his
feet and clinched with otts. On being
parted Otts tried left and right and man
aged to land again on the face, sending
bis dizzy rival down. At this juncture
Captain Gillen entered the ring and
stopped further hostilities. Neal awarded
the decision to Otts.
Wants to Meet Green.
"Lavigne Is the best lightweight that
ever breathed," said Smith after the
bout; "but he was a little out of his class
when he tried to tackle a welter-weight.
He is the fastest fellow I have ever seen
for. his size. I had him going a dozen
times, hut he would not go down. I wal
loped him on the jaw time and again, but
he stood it like a little man.
.â  '.'When the articles of agreement were
signed we agreed to break clean, but hit
with one hand free. That is the reason
why I fought as I did. As to the bandage
on my left hand, that was also agreed to.
and when 'Billy' Lavigne objected to it I
refused to take it off. as my hand was
sore. I didn't feel a blow that the 'Kid'
gave me. Half of them I stopped with
my glove. I intend staying here and hope
to get on a match with Green or Walcott.
1 am willing to take on Walcott and then
light Green two weeks afterward. I am
glad 'Billy' Lavigne jumped Into the ring
when he did, as I did not want to knock
the 'Kid' out. and another punch might
have settled him."
What Lavigne Said.
"Kid" Lavigne, on reaching his dressing
room after the fight, did not upbraid his
brother "Billy" for interfering when he
did, but calmly dressed and left the build
ing. The champion lightweight showed no
signs of punishment, but declared he was
fresher than his late opponent. â¢ In speak
ing of the fight the "Kid" said:
"I admit I was a little bit on queer
street, but was not a bit distressed and
could have gone on and finished if my
brother had not come into the ring. I was
not a bit tired, but was slightly dizzy.
I'm willing to bet Smith was more tired
than I was "when the interruption oc
curred:
"I didn't quite get on to what Billy was
doing. I thought he was saying the gong
Bounded and was trying to drag me to my
corner. Smith fought foul throughout the
contest, but I did not care, as I thought
I could do him."
"Billy" Lavigne Talks.
"Billy" Lavigne, the manager and
brother of the champion lightweight, who
followed the example set by "Connie" Mc-
Vey by jumping into the ring at an im
proper moment, seemed unperturbed at
what he had done, but gave the following
reasons for doing so:
"The referee should have awarded the
fight to my brother earlier in the contest.
Smith repeatedly fouled him and kept up
these tactics right along. He had a great
advantage in fouling. I got tired of see
ing him continuing it and jumped into the
ring. I did not do so to save my brother
from a knockout, tiit simply because I
would not stand foi*3mith's rough work.
Had George followed Smith's game I
would not have Interfered, but as he
didn't and was getting the worst of the
deal, I jumped in."
The Referee's Views.
Immediately after declaring "Mysteri
ous" Billy Smith the victor. Referee Mc-
Donald informed the press representa
tives that he did so because Lavigne's
brother entered me ring at an untimely
moment. .
"Had this not occurred," said the ref
eree, "and the fight had gone the limit,
1 would have declared it a draw, because
in mv opinion Lavigne had the best of
the fight up to the tenth round. From the
tenth to the fourteenth Smith showed to
advantage. I could not decide differently,
as the rules expressly prohibit any of
the seconds entering the ring during the
fighting." ,_____,
Ring-goers were greatly surprised that
Referee McDonald did not follow the pre
cedent established by "Honest" John Kel
ly in the Corbett-Sharkey go. when Mc-
Vey entered the ring, and declare all
bets off, thus saving the public's money.
In the opinion of many present McDon
ald should have followed his example.
