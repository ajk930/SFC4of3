MENTO, Jan. 3.â D. M. Burns is still I
a candidate for United States Senator, j
but his oandidacy no longer has the air |
of prosperity that characterized it at
the preliminary gathering of the clans
last Sunday.
â  The exact nature of the malady that j
â¢ has overtaken the Burns boom and !
prnstrsted it will not admit ot imme

bids fair to bear fatal results there can
h& no doubt. The small army of politi

that has heretofore served to mark the
presence of the railroad candidate in \
any particular locality has been scat
tered by .the premonitory symptoms of
eomirrg disaster and they are now to be

itself felt to even the most case-hard
ened of the tricky crew.
The few among Burns' followers who
are numbered among the respectable
members of society profess to be still
i as confident of ultimate success as they
were when W. F. Herrin launched the
Burns boom four weeks ago. Having
become committed to their present po
sition by reason of personal friendship
or mistaken party fealfy they still cling
to the belief that they cannot be wrong,
and that a majority of the members of
the present Legislature and the oom
munity at large will not continue to
repudiate the man whose past record
reeks of the proceedings of the crimi
nal courts of two republics and who has
suffered imprisonment en the charge of
having robbed the people he now asks
to honor him.
So long as W. F. Herrin was respon
sible for the information that Burns
had entered the race for the Senator
ship there were many who still ex
pressed a kindly feeling for him, be
cause nf their belief that Herrin was
not acting as Burns' mouthpiece. By
such expressions they gained for them
selves the reputation of being Burns
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1899.
supporters. So it was that: Burns, -with
his army of touts and 1 healers from
San Francisco, came .to Sacramento
with a great show of glad smiles and
a jingling of small change, secure in
the belief that the battle was won be
fore the votes were counted and that
all that was left for them to do was
to wait until the proper moment to* do
the shouting.
It was at this point that Burns ven
tured into the open and declared:
"I am a candidate for United States
Senator."
This was twenty-four h^urs ago. The
intervening hours since the announce
ment was made has not â  changed , the
j fact of his candidacy, but it has altered
its complexion. Men who were willing
Ito be on friendly terms .. of Intimacy
with him yesterday are to-day either
declaring their allegiance to other can
didates or professing their Inability to
support the candidacy of Colonel
Burns.
Now that Burns has, by his declara
tion of yesterday, dissolved all doubt, if
any existed, as to his intentions, there
is a scurrying of legislative -feet such
as was not anticipated by either his
friends or his opponents. â  It would
seem that the consequences of as
sociation with the Burns boom is
now looked upon as a badge of
corruption, and , there are ' few who
care to leave public opinion and
court social sftnd political ostracism
by lending support to the man who, as
an official of the State, was indicted, on
twelve counts by the Grand Jury of this
! county for fraudulently appropriating
I the funds of the people of the .State
â  which had been intrusted to his care.
There is a blight on the Burns boom,
and a serious drought is threatened
among the heelers who live by his
smile.
Every resource within their reach is
being resorted to by the Burns men to
| give an air of respectability to his can
di lacy. The San Francisco Federal
brigade has been pressed into service
for this purpose. In this connection
there is a large-sized row brewing. A
majority of the Federal office-holders
who had combined to support Burns
owe their present position on the pay
roll of the * ederal Government to
United States Senator Perkins. It is
well known that Senator Perkins has
expressed himself as being opposed to
Burns' candidacy. Unless the con
spirators can succeed in electing Burns
there will he a new crop of Federal
office-holders in San Francisco within
the next ninety days. Knowing this to
ibe true, the members of the Federal
! brigade are employing every artifice to
spread the belief among State legis
j lators that they are in Sacramento in
i the interest of Burns with the full con
| sent and approval of the administra
: tion at Washington. So far as is known
i this plan of campaign has so far been
. without effect, but it is not unlikely
I that it will bear fruit, not at all In ac
cordance with the desires of * the men
who are engineering the scheme.
The developments of to-day are not
! the only surprises that are in store for
1 Colonel Burns. In spite of the fact that
he is making all possible use of the
: friendship of Governor-elect Gage, the
patronage of the State and the power
of the Southern Pacific Company, he
â  will find his name third on the list
I when the votes are counted after the
| first ballot next Tuesday. 1 l,v

MENTO, Jan. 3.â lt is an evident fact that
the managers of the Burns fight realize
that not only are the prospect of Dan for
success very remote, but they are also
awar? that as time progresses U.om>Â» pros
pects grow more dim. The result Is that
a call nas gone forth over the Stai-3 for
every riHrcad politician, wheebc-r he Y.Â«
Democrat or Republican, makes no differ- ]
ence, to come to Sacramento. The only
question is as to whether or not Vre is ;n j
a position to influence one vote or more I
for the man from Mexico. They are flock
ing in by every train, and if the influx
continues by Saturday night there will be
an aggregation of talent here such as Sac
ramento has never seen before.
Among those arriving last evenrnar was
Harvey Lindley, the repudiated Repub
lican boss of Southern California. Mr.
Lindley went at once to the Golden Eagle
and proceeded to the star-chamber herul
quarters of Colonel Dan, there to remain
closeted for some time. When H*irv?v
came forth he was questioned by a Call
representative and said: "No, I am goln ; j
to take no part in the Senatorial fight. I
am here to look on. You ask am I for
Colonel Burns. Well, now, you can just
put it down that I am not against him."
Further than this Lindley was very reti
cent and cloae-mouthed. He will be one
of Burns' right-hand men to the end of
the fight.

of Burns, the votes of those Democratic
AsÃemblymen would be forthcoming.
' One point is assured and that is this:
If Colonel Mazuma should influence the
votes of a few Democratic Assemblymen
and secure them for some unclean Re
publican, there are other Democratic As
semblymen who stand ready to immedi
ately counteract the effect' of those votes
by casting their own for the Republican
candidate for Senator whose chances of
success were lessened by the casting of
the purchased Democratic votes for his
opponent. ,
At the caucus of the Democratic mem
bers of the Assembly the question came
up as to whether or not in any contin
gency ia Democratic Assemblyman should
ever cast his vote for a' Republican can
didate for Senator.
The question was very generously de
bated and there was considerable differ
ence of opinion. Some thought that in
the event it was necessary for the Dem
ocratic Assemblymen to cast their votes
to break a deadlock, or to elect a Repub
lican who would in no sense be objec
tionable to the people of the State, they
should do so.
There were others who were of the
opinion that the Democratic Assembly
men should give the complimentary vote
to a Democrat from the first ballot to the
last.
The discussion got rather warm, and As
semblyman Mead finally stepped in and
poured oil on the troubled waters. He
suggested that it would be well enough
for the caucus to bridge the difficulty
when it was. reached. Inasmuch as the
conditions, stated -did' not yet exist, he
would advjse that the matter be left open.
This proposition was agreed to. Mr.
Mead also advised his colleagues not to
submit to .interviews as to whether, in
certain contingencies, they would support
this or that Republican candidate for
Senator, for the reason that if rfome Re
publican, good and clean, were to get
eixty-one Republican votes without diffi
culty, th? Democratic Assemblyman who
had"stated that he was going to vote for
some other Republican would be placed
in a most embarrassing position.

Signed Statements Which Show That Gunst's Gambling

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 3.â There will never be a
j circumstance arise nor a condition ex
ist whereby Colonel D. M. Burns will
secure any votes from the Los Angeles
! County delegation for United States
| Senator if the statements made by the
j members themselves are to be given
credenoe, and there is every reason why
they should.
The members of the delegation were
very indignant to-day at the charge
made in the Chronicle that the candi
dacy of Senator Bulla was merely a
"stall" for D. M. Burns and the railroad
company.
Messrs. Valentine, Conrey and Mel
ick were not at all slow in expressing
themselves in very vigorous English.
i Senator Simpson also placed himself
I squarely on record. All of these gen
i tlemen state that at no time will their
votes be at the disposal of Burns. Mr.
Melick stated that he had been ap
proached by some of the Burns follow
ing and sounded, but he was the only
i member of the delegation who made the
i admission.
Senator Bulla himself indignantly
! denied any rumors of combinations
, upon the part of himself or his support

i lowing signed statement:
"I have said so frequently that I
have made no combination or compro

"What I have said with reference

PASSING COMMENT
ON BURNS' AMBITION
Must Go In With a Rush or Not at All if
He Wins the Prize.
Hangers-On Are Now Drifting In and Helping to
Solve the Senatorial and Other Muddles to
Everybody's Satisfaction.
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 3.â As an American citi
zen resident of California and expect
ing to remain here' until' called to a
heavenly home, I. would like the privi
lege of making 'a few remarks about
one Burns; known variously as Dan
1 and as the Colonel. '
Burns hopes to be United States Sen
ator. For months this has been his
plan. If official records do not lie
Burns is a person wholly unworthy of
trust. He has held public office twice.
in each instance a portion of the funds
under his chart disappearing. He was
arrested, put in Jail, and still owes to
the State a trifle of ?31,000. All this is
history, and yet it is the career on
which Burns comes before the Legisla
ture asking, scheming, Intimidating
â with the object of being- elected and
vindicated. Let him first earn vindica
tion through fruits meet tor repentance.
Burns has not always been in public
life. He has a mine in- Mexico. It is
called the Candelaria, and . the man
who had owned it and who confided in
Burns, died but the. other day with a
ci'rse on bis lips for the man who had ,
." * ?n the property. This man is Burns,
candidate by the inexplicable grace of
Providence, by his illimitable nerve and
.the rottenness of some politicians and
the weakness of others, for the United
,' States Senate, a position in which he
would disgrace the State and to which
he could be elected only by the pur
' chase of the corrupt Burns has not
' much chance. â¢ He counts on votes
which will go to other men. If he can
not, win in the fust grand rush he is
gone, fqr the legislator to come over to
'Burns would be branded to the end of
his days, and could. never escape the
! blight. It would be his last vote.
Power so grossly abused would be j
taken away by indignant constituents.
Burns and his gang may boast, but
- their words are idle. The colonel, if
the fear of Mexican law permits, may
Boon go back to his mine, nor worry
lest duty call to "Washington. From a
survey, of the ground 1 regard the
Burns goose as cooked. There, is a line
of assumption beyond which even the
bawdy-house and the tenderloin lose
their efficacy. There is no decent ele
ment behind Burns. Irritation has been
pet up by the raw work manipulated by
. Gambler Gunst in San Francisco and
by the horde of harpies' Burns has
brought with him. The influence of the
railroad, provided 'he ' has it, cannot
save him. .What Dan needs personally
is regeneration, and politically a mira
cle. .The latter being of divine origin
Dan will be left. If he cannot read the
signs all about him I freely and gladly
interpret.
Aside from the tide of respectability
which has set in against Burns, 1 am
unable to discern any great change in
the situation. Bulla, Barnes , and
Knight are still in the field, with Beale
looking over the fence. ; '
Aside from Burns; T. can see no
chance for anybody, but Grant, and as
Burns is a moral impossibility there
' appears no reason why Grant should be
discouraged. Of course, there is talk
of a dark horse. In my estimation,
which may be bad, for I speak with
dr." humility as one not wholly onto
the ways of the political sharps and
sharks, there is not a dark horse in the
lot who has a better chance' than Fatty
Blodes.
. At the Capitol to-day there was a
joint session of the House to listen to
the reading of official returns and to
decide that Gage had been elected Gov
ernor. The announcement created as
.much surprise as it did enthusiasm.
Gage is a puzzle to me. Why he was
picked up and projected into public life
â  may be explained when the heavens
â¢; roll up as a scroll, but at present the
; explanation hinges on a shady political
job. the existence of which one cannot
admit without a sense of shame, so
Gage, for the sake of mental peace,
may be left a mystery. That the man
hardly rises to the common-place must
be admitted, and that he is as wax in
the hands of Burns is painfully evident.
-There was to-day an exhibition of
discourtesy to the retiring Governor.
His message was sent to. the Senate
and Assembly and each body refused to
listen to it. This must not be charged
against them wholly. There was a lack
of time, the hours were gliding by and
certain routine matters had to be dis
' posed of. If Gage fails to be Governor
by a certain hour the commission of
Mose Gunst will expire. Gunst is the
pet of Burns. To be sure he could get
along without his job with the police,
.is the cigar business is prosperous
now, . and Lees is giving games a
â¢chance, but if no longer Commissioner
he would lose a valuable pull of which
Burns has free use. So the message
was cast away. Had It been from on
high, written in letters of fire by a
finger on the wall, it could not have
checked proceedings. Budd retains his
good humor and he has the rheuma
tism, too. â ''*'â 
â¢'â¢ Secretary of State Curry and Martin
" Kelly were in the Golden Eagle this
â  afternoon discussing purity in politics.
.Not far away Jim. Rea and Morehouse
â¢ were probably engaged on the same
theme, It .is cheerijpg to see profes
. sional reformers getting together this
â¢ way. Corrigan, the horseman, is also
â¢' on the ground to see that nothing is
â ' done to impair the integrity of racing.
" Altogether the prospect of spiritual
. renovation seems excellent. The Rev.
Mr. Miel protests that when he sat in
the lobby of the hotel Sunday smoking
a pipe, with Dennery near, he was not
lobbying for a job. I am glad to hear
it, and also that he did not get the job.
It may be that he was holding service
' with a view to uplifting his feilowmen.
â¢If so, he had surely struck a crowd in
rreed of it.
Hangers-on of the Legislature are
beginning to arrive. The wonder, is
how the} get here. As they are about
three days late a suspicion arises that
: they walked- They will find the park
too cool for sleeping purposes and
ouÂ°ght to be counseled to. go home. If
anybody here has money to spend, at
least, it is being spent where it will
have more' effect than If devoted to !
"charity. Some of these stragglers want i
'jobs, more of them find content, In the
price of a steam. But there is not one
in the crew who cannot tell all about
the Senatorial situation. They believe |
in Burns yet, for Dan has been too
busy to turn them down.
By the way, the Examiner's allusion
to a boodle contest seems to me the
throwing of a stone, while delicately
shielded from a return of the missile
by glass. The Examiner has before
now backed an aspirant whose capital
was not his purity and whose sack was
wide open. Huwever, while history is
being so rapidly made, there is no util
ity in turning to any back chapters.
1 forgot to state that the Bee is open
in support of Irving M. Scott. It ad
mires him as frankly as it despises
Burns. In its former attitude it receiv
dial support, but I have searched
vainly for a wave of fervid indorsement
of the second.
The weather to-day has been as fine
as Professor Hammon ever turned out
of his factory. It has brought upon the
street many handsome women, but if
permitted to pass judgment in a matter
so delicate, I would say that the Sacra
mento beauty i* at her best in summer
togs, such as she employed during the
conventions to add joy to life.
For all the interest in the Senatorial
fight, it progresses quietly. There are
no seductive bottles in the various
headquarters, as are to be seen in such
wild and wanton commonwealths as
Colorado or Nebraska when a toga is
in sieht. Instead, there is a handshake
for the wayfarer. When General Barnes
went so far as to place a box of cigars
on his table he was accused of treason.
This evening there arrived a multi
tude of statesmen, diplomats and emi
nences from San Francisco. They came
to see that Gage shall be properly in
augurated, so that California and Mose
Gunst may continue in business at the
old stand.
At a late hour to-night there seems
to be ground for changing the views ex
pressed above as to the candidates for
the Senate. It is certain that Burns has
not the strength he claims or his fol
lowers are ashamed to confess, while
the Grant contingent gains confidence
hourly. Senator Shortridge declares
himself for MorehouÃe to succeed
White. He is now searching the library
for fitting words in which to express
his exultation when shall be the happy
moment of hi? heralding the triumph
of the man with the stainless heart.
Men who fear that the ship of state
will list dangerously in the breeze nf
ambitions may be reassured. Jake
Steppacher Is h*>re, bald, calm, subtile
ar.d wary, with bis hand firmly on the
helm, and all is well.
DEPRESSION EXISTS
IN THE BURNS CAMP
CALL HEADQUARTERS.. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 3.â The Federal pla^e hold
ers. wh<? ought to be at their respective
desks in San Francisco, are here in Sacra
mento, boastins: that the State patronage
will be distributed by Governor Gage to
promote the election of Dan Burns to the
United States Senate. To-day Mr. Gage
made the statement to one Senatorial can
didate that the State patronage should
not be used to assist any aspirant in the
contest. There is reason to believe that
Burns during the past twenty-four hours
has renewed his pull on Gage to further
draw him into his fight, and to extort
from the Governor a promise that certain
appointments should be made. It is said
that Gage firmly refused to go in deeper,
asserting that he had gone far enough.
The promise so eagerly sought to help the
touts was not obtained.
Something happened last night to cause
extreme depression in the Burns camp.
Dan was greatly dejected this morning
aft-'r a sleepless night and repeated fail
ures to extort from Gnge the promise of
favors. Ominous tidinps from Pan Fran
may have reached the "colonel's"
quarters, for the gloom was on all after-
Down in the barroom of the hot'-i
the touts who were yesterday claiming
thirty-five votes for Burn* on first ballot
were making estimates of twenty-five.
Another reason assigned for the depres
sion was the. receipt of intelligence from
Pan Francisco that quite a number of In
fluential business men. who have the wel
f;in- of the State at. herirt. were engaged
in a quiet movement to induce C. P. Hunt-
Ington to instruct Herrin to pull down
Burns. The knowledge that D. S. Grant
and James Brown took a flying trip to
San Francisco yesterday and returned to
day confident and aggressive, produced
extreme depression among the followers
of the ex-Secretary of State. Recalling the
manner by which the railroad once threw
down De Young after he had been bal
loted for. the touts began to swear that
the corporation could not keep faith with
anybody.
The first ballot for Senator will be taken
next Tuesday and the candidates are no-v*
casting nbnut for erood speakers for nomi
nation talk. In th* 3 Assembly Burns will
be placed in nomination by either Judge
Dibble or Grove Johnson. Dibble would
like to vote for his old and able friend,
General Barnes, but in doing this he
mieht follow the dictates of his con
science and so break a resolution formed
many years ago that he would never al
low his conscience to become a tyrant.
While Dibble's vote is for Burns, his
h^art is true to Barnes.

iar ligurf'S in the lobby of the Legisla
ture. Each is a holder of a position
under the present administration and
lx>th are "touting" for Dan Burns. As

and Shaen to the lobby of the Legisla
ture. Tiie Call has straight information
that they are here to defeat proposed
legislation to regulate the telephone busi
ness and in this particular mission theÂ»
are the agents of the Sunset and Pacific
Telephone companies. The information
is published by The Call to put the mem
bers of the Legislature "on," so that the
progress of bills providing for the reg
ulation of telephone companies may be
closely watched.
Shaen and Steppacher cannot be dis
played as the highest products of pure
politics, but they are good enough to
Berve Uncle Sam in subordinate places.
The point is advanced that they ought
to be at their respective places of duty,
T>h'r<> they might be able to earn their
salary.
Telephone companies perform public
service in the same sense that railroad
and telegraph companies are supposed to
serve th. people. As the telephone corpor
ations act under franchises and enjoy
public privileges they are subject to legis
lative restrictions, and it is the duty of
the Legislature to provide proper regu
lations for the control of the service.
There Is no indication that members of
the Legislature have banded together to
cinch the corporations or impose upon
them onerous restraints. There is an in
creasing sentiment, however, throughout
California in favor of regulating the cor
poration, especially in regard to the dis
closure of messages. The companies also
enjoy great public privileges which have
enabled them to acquire vast sum* of,
money and valuable properties. That thÂ«
companies should be compelled to ejn
tribute a just share nf taxes c-tnnot be
disputed. The managers may find it to
their advantage in the long run to be
ware of lobbyists, and trust their affairs
at Sacramento to the representatives
elected by the people.

To the promoters, of the voting machine

found no trouble in buying up all of the
votes he needed on a graduated scale of
prices ranging from 5250 to $00.
Shortly after rjoon to-morrow there will
be a caucus of t'ne Senate for the purpose
of forming an investigating committee,

and have already stated that the men
who have expressed their Intentions to
vote lor me are intelligent, patriotic
citizens and will do only what they be
lieve to be for the best interests of the
Statf.
"Knowing this to be the fact it would
be utter folly for me to attempt to en
ter Into any agreement looking ' â  the
delfvery of their votes to any other
cardidate.
"As a candidate I have no personnl
feHing of animosity toward any oth^r
candidate, no matter what has been
said by others to that effect. Of course,
I am doing all in my power, legitimate
ly and honorably, to defeat every other

"If unsuccessful T shall accept my
defeat with entire resignation and shall
continue in the discharge of my duties
as a citizen and as a public officer to
the very best of my knowledge and
ability. ROBERT N. BULLA."
Assemblyman L. H. Valentine fur
nished The fall with tho following
vigorous statement over his signature:
"If there is a member of the Los
Angeles County delegation who at any
time or under any circumstances in
tends to vote for Colonel Burns for
Ponator. T do not know his name. I
desire to state that in my judgment
if any member of the delegation should
vote for the colonel, it would be unwise
for him to return to his constituents.
"We are in this fight for Bulla and
we are not considering any other factor
in it. We are for Bulla in good faith
and for him alone. It is utter folly
for any one to make the charge that we
are acting the part of stalking horses
for any other candidate.
"Even if we were inclined to support
some one other than Bulla, we could
not do so under our instructions as long
as there is even a possibility of his
winning.
"After we leave Bulla in the event
that we find that it is Impossible for
him to win we are compelled by our in
structions to go to the support of some
other Southern California man. By no
stretch of imagination could Colonel
Burns be denominated as a Southern
Californlan, so he can never obtain aay
.votes from Southern California,
"I* H. VALENTINE."
Assemblyman W. S. Melick stated
when seen that under no circumstances
did he think a vote from Los Angeles
County would go to Burns.
Assemblyman N. P. Conrey was
equally as vigorous in his statement as
his colleague, Mr. Valentine. He said
that under no circumstances could or
would a member of the Los Angeles
delegation go to Burns. He added that
if the question were submitted to the
Republicans of Los Angeles County not
100 could be found who would indorse
the vote of a member of the delegation
for Burns.
Senator Simpson of Pasadena stated
that no one had .ever approached him
and asked him t<. vote for .Burns, and
he added that it was just as well that
no one had, for he never would or could
do so under his instructions. The Sen
ator stated that in the event It was
found that Bulla could not win the
Senatorial prize the votes of the Los
Angeles County delegation, under in
structions, must go to a Southern
California man.
D. C. McGarvin, the secretary of the
Republican County Committee of Los
Angeles County, who is In the city,
made the following statement, which
shows that according to his idea it will
never be possible for a Los Angeles
County Assemblyman or Senator to
cast his vote for Burns. Mr. McGarvin
said: "I do not see how any member of
the Los Angeles County delegation un
der the instructions and platform upon
which they were elected, can vote for
any other than a Southern California
man for United States Senator at any
time, nor for any man oth"r than Sena
tor Bulla as long as he has a prospect
of winning."
It is undeniably true that there is
some pressure being brought, to bear
to secure a vote or two of the eieht
votes in the Lop Angeles delegation for
Burns. The pressure comes from the
Southern Pacific Railroad influence in
Southern California and from the Fed
eral brignde. But numerically the sup
porter? of Burns' candidacy in South
ern California can be counted on the
fingers of your two hands. Senator (

who are for Burns. One of them must

in? generated by Walter P. Parker.
Of course, Guy Barham is on hand, too,

GREEN HOLDS ON
TO THE CASH BOX
Breezy Story Anent a Change
of Officials That Has Not
Yet Taken Place.
CATAj HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan 3.â Will S. Green, the retir
ing State Treasurer, still stands guard
over the box containing the $3,500,000 of
the State's wealth and Truman Reeves,
his successor, Is a guest in the office un
der the restrictions which the relation of
guest to host implies. When Mr. Green
gets through counting the State's money
he will let Mr. Reeves assume the posi
tion which the latter imagined was
his already. The story was one of the
breeziest which the Capitol corridors of
fere'l to-day.
According to the accepted version of the
Incident Reeves sent his guard into the
office late yesterday afternoon while
Green was absent in another office and
instructed him to secure the keys from
the man on watch. The request was com
municated to Green by his deputy and
Green commanded him to hold onto the
keys until further orders from him. In
the night, when the second watch was to
go on duty, forces arrived from both
Reeves' and Green's camps, but Green's
had the possession and the other side did
not hold enough cards to overcome the
nine . points contained therein. One of
Green's deputies finally came to him and
told him that ofte of Reeves' guards in
sisted on staying inside and sitting
around.
Green, so the story goes. Instructed the
deputy to meet the guard on social terms
and let him sit about so long aa he did
no harm. "Rut if he goes to interfering
with your duties or tries to take posses
sion of the office," said Mr. Green, "why
just shoot him. You have shotguns in the
office fur that purpose."
When Reeves found that Green meant
business he sought an interview. Green
told him that he had held many public
positions of trust in his day and genera
tion and that it has always been his prac
tice to permit his predecessor to take an
inventory of the property before leaving
the office. He expected the same courtesy
at tho hands of Mr. Reeves. Further
more, paid Mr. Green; it had always been
the practice in the office of the State
Treasurer in this State for the retiring
officer to remain in until he had assisted
in the count of the money in the vault
and obtained a receipt from his successor..
Green learned that State Controller Col
gan had announced that he would not
after yesterday recognize Green as Treas
urer nor would he draw warrants for the
pay of the deputies after yesterday. To
this, so the story proceeds, Mr. Green
made reply that he was a Democrat, but
still had kept on the Republicans in
spite of strong pressure to remove them.
and that when he got back to his edi
torial seat in the Colusa Sun office he
would show that a member of Controller
Colgan's family was drawing a hand
some salary every month for which she
did no work. Peace was finally patched
up with Green in undisputed possession
of the office and Reeves will have to wait
until all the money is counted before he
can actually become Treasurer.
A CLASH IMMINENT
BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 3.â There is danger that the
impending clash between the legislative
and executive departments may come be
fore Governor Gage can be inaugurated.
The story now told in whispers relates
to the State Printing Office.
The other night a Republican Assembly
man in caucus proposed that the first
bill of the session should be a measure to
appropriate $2.5,000 for printing:, and thus
open simultaneously the State Printing
Office and the State treasury. Grove L.
Johnson stood for the big allowance of
$275,000, while Henry C. Dibble insisted
tnat $100,000 would be a sufficient sum with
which to begin operations. Dibble gained
his point in caucus, and according to the
plans a bill to appropriate $100,000 was in
troduced. It has already passed into the
history of the session as A. B. No. 1.
To-day Grove Johnson explained that
amendments to the bill were necessary.
One amendment reduced the allowance
from $100,000 to $50,000. The story is going
around to-night that several Senators
sounded Governor Gage to ascertain his
views regarding the -proposed appropria
tion. To what extent they were enlight
ened is not told, but they got the infer
ence somehow the figure was too .high for
Gage. The sounding Senators then took
it upon themselves to advise the Assembly
leaders w'lth the suggestion that the Sen
ate would not stana for a larger amount
than $50,000. The Assemblymen to whom
the advice was- given fired up in anger and
wanted to know who in Halifax was run
ning: the Assemblyâ the Senate, Governor
Gage or the Burns lobby. The Senators
themselves are warming up. One of them
remarked to-night: "I wonder if the exec
utive proposes to run the Legislative de
partments as well as the Governor's of
fice? We will sc-e how he comes put."

Los Angeles is now without occupants.
The two remaining attaches of the Gov

morning, and soon it is expected their
names will be entered upon the. payrolls
of the State. The two latest arrivals
were Daniel Kevane and C. J. Fox. They
came in at noon and joined the throng of
Los Angeles County office-seekers at the

The horde of seekers after official posi
tion, who claim Los Angeles as their resl

numbers to make up a small-sized army.
As soon as Governor Gage provides for
his stenographer, C. J. Fox, and for. his
general 'factotum. Dan Kevane he will
have given places to every individual who
had any connection with his law business
in Los Angeles. Among others here from
Los Angeles looking for places are Fred
Smith John Francis, Tommy Smith, John
Morton J. L. Stuart and about ten others
who are not listed at any. of the large hos

received but did not have read Governor
Budd's second biennial message, and |
Budd's friends are claiming that the ac- I
tion was unprecedented, and showed scant
courtesy to the retiring Governor. It is
not at all likely, however, that any dis
respect was intended, omission being due
entirely to lack of time owing- to Govern
or-elect Gage's mandate that he be in
augurated, to-morrow in order that he
may save Burns' gambling partner, Host

having been issued, the Legislature has
nothing to do but obey, and formalities
must be dispensed with in order to save
time.
The Senate took a recess at noon to

was not fatal and the resolution got the
four-fifths vote it needed.
In the afternoon Governor Budd's mes
sage was brought in and announced from
the floor, but upon motion of Belshaw its
reading was dispensed with and it was
ordered printed in the Journal.
Assemblyman Grove Johnson followed
Belshaw's resolution with Assembly con
current resolution No. 1. which provided
that a committee of three be appointed to
discuss with a like committee from the
Senate plans for the inaugural ball. I'pon
adoption of the resolution Speaker Wright
appointed Works of San Diego. Duniap of
Stockton and Wardell of San Francisco.
Later Secretary of the Senate Brandon
announced that that body had concurred,
and in the afternoon the committee re
ported that it would need the whole cap
ital, its rotunda, corridors and nails from
Saturday afternoon until after the ball. A
second concurrent resolution gave them
possession of the building from after ad
journment on Saturday afternoon until 10
o'clock Tuesday morning next.
Valentine of Los Angeles introduced a
joint resolution calling for a joint session
df the Senate and Assembly in the Assem
bly chamber for 2 o'clock this afternoon
for the purpose of canvassing the guber
natorial vote. It was adopted, and later
the Senate concurred and recess was
taken until 2 o'clock.
At that hour the sergeant at arms of
the Senate announced to Speaker Wright
that the members of the Senate were
waiting without the portals. Speaker
Wright bade the visiting members enter,
and, with Secretary Brandon leading,
they tiled in and found seats that had
been provided for them on the floor. After
the- rollcall of both houses the Speaker
announced that, pursuant to the law, he
was about to open the ballots that lay
before him and would canvass the vote
as provided In the Political Code. Sec
retary Brandon read the necessary sec
tions from the code and the constitution,
and the count was begun. It developed
that the total vote cast for Governor was
256.!>96. Of these Gage got 148.334 and Ma
guire 120.255. Harriman got 5101 and Me-
Comas 4207.
The vote for Lieutenant Governor footed
up 280,335. Neff received 146,32.", Hutchison
got 118.915. The result of the canvass was
announced and Henry Gage was declared
by 'the Speaker Governor of the Stoto of
California and Jacob Neff his lieutenant.
The joint session was then declared ad
journed until to-morrow afternoon, pur
suant to a joint resolution declaring that
hour the time when Governor Gage
should be formally Inaugurated. The in
augural ceremonies will take place in
the Assembly chamber.
After the 'Senate had retired and the
Assembly was again called to order
Grove L. Johnson moved that his bill
appropriating $100,000 for the support of
the State Printing Office be taken up by
the Assembly as a committee of the
whole, as he desired to amend it and sub
mit it for final passage under a suspen
sion of tho rules. He made the necessary
motion and it was seconded by Dibble
and passed and Johnson moved to amend
by striking out all those portions of it
that provided that work might be done
by private firms when the State office
wns busy. He also cut down the appro
priation to $50,000, and cut up in this way
it was favorably reported by thr> commit
tee of the whole and made the special or
der to follow the reading of the journal
to-morrow morning.
Adjournment was then taken until 10
o'clock to-morrow morning.

VICTOR NAPOLEON
PLANNING A COUP
Paris Paper Says the Prince Will
Have the Full Support of His
Brother.
PARIS, Jan. 4.â The Matin this morn
ing publishes an interview with a prom
inent Bonapartist purporting to give the
gist of Prince Victor Napoleon's state
ments to his committee the other day at
Brussels.
This represents him as preparing assid
uously for a coup which he is fully re
solved to execute. Prince Victor, how
ever, is hostile to all useless manifesta
tions. His brother. Prince Louis Napo
leon, will be found beside him on the day
of action. They are "closely united in
warm and sincere affection."
FORMS OF CONTRACTS
TO GOVERN PACKERS
Stringent Provisions Adopted by the
California Raisin Growers'
Association.
FRESNO. Jan. 3.â A meeting of the
! California Raisin Growers' Association
! was held here to-day at which delegates
1 from all parts of the State were present.
The entire day was devoted to the con
j slderation of forms of contracts which
\ shall govern the growers and packers in
, the combine. Two contracts were adopted
| to govern the packers, one for the pri
| vate and co-operative packers and the
â¢ other for the commercial packers. The
former is very stringent in its provisions
' and gives the association complete con
trol of the goods handled by the packers,
i The association expects to sell directly
i all raisins packed under this contract.
The contract with the commercial pack
ers is the same except that they .'ire per
mitted to buy the goods which they pack
and to sell the same on a 5 per cent com
; mission, not more than 24 per cent of
which may go for Eastern brokers under
j penalty of forfeiture of the entire corn-
mission. The form of the proposed con
tract has not been submitted to the pack
ers and it is not thought that they will
accept It.
The contract with the growers Is practi
cally the same as that of last year, except
that it is revised to avoia the anti-trust
law. Each grower signing it turns over
an undivided 5 per cent interest In his
crop to the association in consideration
of $1 and the services of the association
in grading and marketing the crop.
The proceedings were very harmonious
and most of the forms were adopted
unanimously. The growers are deter
mined to "exterminate the commercial
packers and probably will succeed if the
present form of contract holds.

DUELIST TOO SCARED
TO SHOOT STRAIGHT
Ludicrous Affair of Honor Between
Baron Banffy and M. Horanz
sky at Vienna.
LONDON, Jan. 4.â The Vienna corres
pondent of the Daily Mail says: The duel
between Baron Banffy and M. Horanzsky
was a ludicrous? affair. The seconds had
arranged a fight to the death at twenty
paces. M. Horanzsky, however, when he
faced his opponent was agitated beyond
all control, and Baron Banffy was hardly
more comfortable.
Each discharged four shots, but all so
wide of the mark that the bullets were
found lodged in the roof or high on the
walls of the riding school where the en- i
counter took place. The duellists finally
left the building, scowling fiercely at each
other.

VICTIM OF THE STORM.
Young Miner Found Dying on tne
Mountains Near Redding.
REDDING, Jan. 3.â One fatality Is re
ported as the result of the heavy storm
of the past few days. A young man
named Harkness and his winter partner
started on Sunday from their mining
property on Clear Creek for Shasta to
procure supplies. On the divide between
the two points Harknesa became ex
hausted. His partner hurried on to ob
tain assistance.
Several Shastaites started on horseback
to rescue Harkness. They found him un
conscious. A lar^e dog belonging to
Harkness was lying down on his body.
and the warmth from the canine probably
was all that kept the man alive. The
party of rescuers succeeded in restoring
the young miner to consciousness and
hurried him to the county hospital, but
he passed away after having been there
a couple of hours.
EVIDENCE OF MUEDER.
Patrick O'Connor Was Dead Before
Struck by a Train.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3. â Patrick
O'Connor, a section hand in the employ ]
Of 'the Southern Pacific Company at West j
Glerdnle. was found lying upon the track
dead and badly mangier! this morning. At -
first it was believed that he had been run
over last night by the San Francisco
train while in an intoxicated condition,
but later developments point to murder.
When the body was brought to this city
a cursory examination showed a bullet
hole in the left side of the neck, which is
powder burned. The missile traversed I
the neck and came out back of the right
ear. The other injuries upon the body,
those undoubtedly caused by the locomo
tive after O'Connor was dead, are a
crushed forehead and left side of the face
and the right arm cut off. The Coroner
will make an investigation to-morrow.

GOVERNOR GAGE IS
IN A POUTING MOOD
He More Than Justifies the Remarkable
Prophecy of His Friends.
In an Absurd Effort to Inflict Punishment for Criticism
He Places the Associated Press to Great
Inconvenience.
Governor-elect Henry T. Gage has more ]
than justified by his ar-tions the prophecy i
of his friends. They declared in all truth j
that he had never held public office and
would act as if he had not if he were i
elected Governor. The dearest friend of !
the chief executive could not ask him to j
act more unlike a public officer than he
has already done. The Governor-elect is
pouting. As a child posing in a new j
gown before a mirror and trying to be im
portant he has made himself ridiculous.
Whore he sought to punish he has simply
amused.
Governor-elect Gage will assume his
gown of office to-day and will deliver an
Inaugural address. As a document of
state the paper will be of public impor
tance irrespective of the personal charac
ter of its creator. It has been the cus
tom for years beyond memory.for public
officers, such as Presidents of the United
States and Governors of States, to give
advance copies of their messages and im
portant addresses to the Associated Press.
This is done as a matter of convenience
and to insure absolute accuracy in tele
graphic transmission. There is always a
condition that the documents so received
shall not be released until permission is
given. In the history of the Associated
Press this condition has never been vio
lated.
In accordance with the custom a repre
sentative of the Associated Press called
upon Governor-elect Gage and asked him
for an advance copy of his inaugural ad
dress, at the same time giving the chief
executive the positive assurance that the
document would not be released until
permission was given. Mr. Gage emphat
ically refused to give the Associated Press
a cofiy.
"I would be pleased to see every paper
in the State have It." he said, "with the
exception of The Call. 1 am in a row with
that paper ami I do not want it to have
a copy of my address. I understand The
Call is a member of the Associated Press
and I cannot give you a copy."
The representative of the Associated
Press pleaded that it would be obviously
linji st to inconvenience the newspapers
of the State simply because Mr. Gage and
Th Call do not agree. The representa
tive promised that the Governor-elect
had thousands of precedents for giving
his address under seal. Presidents of the
United States and Governors had done
so before him and absolute faith had
been kept. The silly gentleman was ob
durate and the more stubborn he became
the larger grew the projected image of

ated.
"Governors and Presidents are no pre

not git my message until it is delivered
to the Legislature.
The representative of the Associated
Press returned three times to his task,
but Mr. Gage, with increasing petulance,
which In a child provokes spanking, was
firmer in his refusal.
Ho unnecessarily disturbs himself with
a foolish belief that he will punish The
Call by refusing to give his message, un
der Beal, in advance. He should relieve
his mind of its delusion. Mr. Gage is not
punishing The Call, and cannot. The Call
does not wish his address in advance, as
it is equipped to obtain the news and will
do so. The Call is chagrined, however, to
discover that the mental horizon of Mr.
Gage has not broadened to the necessities
of the high position he occupies.
Mr. Gage construes Into enmity a legit
imate criticism of his acts. He believes
that bCbause criticism follows his alliance
with a knavish politician and a' blackleg
Police Commissioner, the critic is an en
emy. Mr. Gage is a public officer, and as
auch is more powerful for good or evil
than he was a few months. ago. When he

Comments on Public Institutions and Their Management
and a Criticism of the Affairs of the

Following is the full text of Governor

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. ]
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, \
. January 3. 1899. '
To thi B ind Assembly:
Gentlemenâ] yield to my successor,
with greater pleasure than 1 received
from my predecessor, the Governorship
of the State of California. When 1 wius
inaugurated the financial condition of the
ua- deplorable; and the task I
me, with a Legislature composed of polit
ical was a formidable one.
For a number of years the State had
been under a financial cloud, and had pur-
B slipshod, down-at-the-heel, bor
ruw-from-Peter-to-pay-Paul policy.
Payment* of its debts were delayed,
and its warrants were at a discount on
the streetâ a condition of affairs disgrace
ful at home and disastrous abroad.
Its Institutions were under neither sys
tematic nor uniform laws, the asylums
were tilling with those not entitled to
shelter and deficiencies were the order of
lay.
Bounties were paid on coyote scalps and
the indigent laws made the basis of gross
frauds.
The controller's estimates continued to;
ri to report, and the
igmented the amounts, be
yond all reason.
State property was at .loose ends; no 1
t whs tak^n thereof and no inven
givei or required.
Imitations of food filled the markets to
iriment of the real products of the
Iterations abounded everywhere,
and the laws of health were openly ig
â¢
our roads were a disgrace and the '
money spent upon them largely wasted j
throug-h ignorance of the art of road- '
building.
County governments existed by permis
sion only, as there was no constitutional
law regulating them.
Tax sharks thrived on the distress of
I "|'ie.
our codes were practically shapeless,!
ssor had urged the crea- !
iron** of a commission to put them in
form.
The University of California suffered
from tack of funds and proper buildings
had twice been denied the Affiliated Col
.
Uess taxation was placed on the '
people for the useless institutions that
had sprung up.
This was, in part, the condition of the
when l assumed the responsiblll
t this office. As I relinquish them
Jam glad to say that all these con litiona
have undergone a radical and permanent
change.
Of the many-
State funds there
are four which de
rive their revenue
in whole or in part
from- a- tax on real
and personal prop
erty. These are:
.1. The unlversU
ty fund, for which
the law provides annually two cents
on every hundred dollars of value of
..property in the State. This â¢Is a fixed
charge and a "continuing" appropria
tion.

State Funds.
2. The interest and sinking fund which
providi s $141,435 annually
certa â  â : Id by thÂ« -
Treasury in trust for ttx- Wtat<- c
fund and university fund, and for .
belonging to the endow
ment fund of the university. The amount
to be raised for this fund is also fixed by
law.
3. The State school fund. This is the
fund fr..m which the State's portion of
the expenses of our common schools are
apportioned.
4. The gen< r.tl fund. This is the fund
from which tiie ordinary expenses of the
State government other than for school
purpost a ;iri i>aid.
The only three of these funds which
are included in the tax levy bill and law
are:
1. The Interest and sinking fund.
2. The school fund.
3. The general fund.
The first of these (the interest and sink

the principal one is the ad valorem tax

third fund it!. | fund) is
up principally from a tax on real
and personal property, tixtd by the tax
law at each session of the Legisla
ture. [1 is the fund from which appro
priation:--, claims against the State and
ordini es are usually paid. The
amount Included in the tax levy bill for
this fund determines whether we will
have high or low taxes. All the othersâ
the Interest, the university and s
fundsâare fixed by existing laws and de-
Lermlned by established conditions
It is the theory of the Government that
the amounts included in the tax levy bill
for that fund shall be sufficient with
moneys on hand to pay off all appropria
inade during the session.
Whether or not the amount of the ve
toed items or bills be Included In the tax
!<-vy bill, the veto itself is a saying to the
people, for but for it the amounts vetoed
must be paid.
As its name indicates, the general fund
is the all important one. This has been
r< cognized by Covernors. by Treasurers
and by Controllers, and the condition of !
this fund has excited their utmost care
and solicitude, because when It is ex
hausted tin- credit of the State is im
paired and claims against it go unpaid.
To maintain this fund, to pay
ors of the Btate as their debts accrue
and to prevent the hawking of the
troller's warrants on the street are things
nii.^t desirable. Yet so careless 1;,,
Ptate been In the past, so intent i:
cials !n straining every energy to gain
what is called a low tax rate (a thing of
no particular significance, unless related
to a fixed valuation of property, aÂ« will
be shown hereafter), that the State hns,
year by year, willfully permitted the
g.-.'irra! fund to become exhausted, and its
creditorsâ the merchants and mechanics,
the contractors and laborers, doing busi
ness with the Stateâ to wait for months
at a time for their money, or has com
pelled the Controller to make transfers of
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually
to save its credit.
When I became
Governor the bal
ance in the general
fund was so small
and the demands
against it so large
that its exhaustion
long prior to the
commencement of
General Fund
in State
of Depletion.
"* ~~ â¦ my lirst fiscajapear
was a certainty. The fund became ex
hausted in May, 1895. It became exhausted
again in July. 1895. and so remained until
December, 1895, when the first installment
of taxes for the forty-seventh fiscal year
was paid into the general treasury.
This condition of affairs was the usual
one. Against it a previous Governor had
protested, the retiring State Treasurer in
1894 had detailed with much feeling the
dishonor in this conduct of the State and
the Stale <'omroller, in his report of De
cember 15. IJ>!<4. said:
"On June 9, 1593. the general fund be
came exhausted, and at the close of the
fiscal year. June 89, it had been over
drawn to the extent of $136,012 0(j, as is
shown in the foregoing summary. Cash
payments were not resumed until the Ist
of January following, at which time this
amount of outstanding warrants was
over $1,5'"h).i<00."
This statement the Legislature should
ponder, for the spectacle of a great State
like California having its warrants in the
streets to the amount of $1,500,000 at a
time is most discreditable. This occurred
in December, 1593. Further and properly
the Controller said:
"That such a condition of affairs should
exist at any time is to he deplored, but
it was especially unfortunate at that
particular time, as the State was suffering
' greatly from the gent-ral financial dis
tress then prevailing, and to have the
> State suspend payment subjected numbers
i of contractors, merchants and employes
' of the State to great Inconvenience and
no small pecuniary loss. This condition
; of the general funu is not unusual. It has
I been exhausted, with few exceptions, ever
! since the foundation of the State, but it
| can and should be guarded against in the
future, and I cannot impress too strongly
upon your Excellency and the Legislature
i the necessity of so doing."
In 1594 the Controller was compelled to
make a transfer of $860,000 from other
funds with which to meet the demands
against the general fund. (.See Controller's
letter, appendix A.)
The matter was so serious that I made
this condition of the general fund my
special care, and determined to remedy
the evil during my term of office.
a a To that end T re-
quired appropria
tion bills (concern-
Ing which I con
ferred with tho
Legislature) to con-
I tain a clause mak
ing the appropria
tions not available
How the
Fund Was
Replenished.
"* â¼â  until the January
following. I made it clear to the
chairmen of the Finance Committees of
the two houses that the tax levy bill for
the forty-seventh fiscal year must provide
! sufficient to pay the debts, deficiencies.
' overdrafts ;ind outstanding warrants of
previous administrations and such claims
as might legitimately come ncrninst the
fund: that a nne-twenty-fourth clause
should be Inserted in the genera] appro
, priation act to prevent deficiencies in the
; future, and that a sufficient surplus must
i be provided to leave a balance with which
to pay demands between the beginning of
a fiscal year and the payment of the first
installment of taxes.
>iy requests were cheerfully followed.
Two millions of appropriations made by
the Legislature were vetoed, and the ex
penditures from the fund were lessened
by some half million of dollars a year by
laws.
Through these matters combined, and
with $427,533 less in the tax levy bill for
the general fund than in the bill for the
two years ending June 30, 1891, the State
has been placed upon a firm cash basis.
As the Controller said in his report
of December 15, 1896:
"The general fund is now in a most
healthy condition, and should not be al
lowed to again become exhausted. As is
shown in the foregoing summary, the bal
m the fund on June 30 last was
1 ?J..")5719U 10, and at writing there still re
mains a heavy balance."
And in his report of December 15, 1898,
only a few days ago, he says:
"During the two fiscal years covered by
this report there has been no deficiency in
this fund. The balance on June : j ,u, 1898,
flown in the foregoing summary was
$2,001,093 71. At this writing (December 1,
there is a balance of $665,538 00, and
tills will be largely increased during the
present month by the incoming first mi
i stallation of State taxes."
Here, certainly, are changes in the
ial affairs of the State, of great b< ti
lt, accomplished under and by this
administration. At the same time ex
ttures from the general fund have
been reduced hundreds of thousands of
dollars annually.
The results of attempting to conduct
this State <vi overdrafts and transfer
funds is shown in the following table:

Governor Waterman during the entire
first half of the fiscal year from July 1,
1890, to January 1, 1891, received from
property taxes only $187,218 94 in the gen
eral fund, and left therein when his term
expired, about January 1, 1891. $125,019 82,
to which was added during the month of
January, 1891, the first month of Governor
Markham's term, the sum of $1 .819.711 57,
which makes $1,944,731 39, the true balance
chargeable to Governor Markham.

this law he received during his lirst six

Since my lirst fiscal year the amount
of the tax' levy bill for the General Fund
has born smaller than for any year since
the forty-third fiscal year. The causes of
the smallnesa of that year's fund are
stated in the Controller's report of 1592.
The attempt to make the tnx Levy bill for
the forty-third and forty-fourth fiscal
years low was followed by consequences
which might have been foreseen, i. c.,
thai the General Fund In 1892 and 1893 was
overdrawn and exhausted to the extent
of $1 971 113 00, a condition commented on
by the Controller in his report of 1594 as
most deplorable and leaving the creditors
of the State to hawk their warrants on
the public streets. <Sco Controller's let

The tax bill of 1595 for the General Fund
was nearly half a million dollars less than
the tax levy bill for the same fund for
the two years ending June 30, IS9I.
The tax levy bill for the last two years
of my administration for this fund is
$5,107,204. or less than for any preceding
period during eight years.

as the overdrafts or the immense trans

â â¦ f tain the credit of
the State as we have established it.
But If either endeavor to economize by
lessening the amount of the school fund
apportionment. It will have to be done
! by reducing the amount to be raised each
! year for each school census child, a crip
! pllng- of the schools and a reduction of
j the .salaries of the teachers. This Is a
, proposition that has been advanced here-
I tofore, but has not found favor, nor
should it.
The number of State institutions and
inmates maintained during the past four
years largely exceed those maintained in
former years, as the following table
shows:
Average
â Institutions. Population.
1889 11 5479
1890-93 13 8630
18Â»4 16 7175

Thus, with more institutions and more
i inmates, the general cost to the State has
been much less than during the former
administrations.
The laws of this State make the Con
| troller its bookkeeper and the superin
i tendent of its finances. His function*
and responsibilities are greater than those
of any other officer, the Governor ex
| cepted, and his recommendations are en
i titled to the most profound consideration,
it is largely because of the lack of con
sideration given to the recommendations
of Controllers that the affairs of this
State, during the eight years preceding
this administration, became so tangled
and expensive, and the deficiencies of the
; general fund so great. While the State
! has now been established on a cash basis
1 and there is a very large sum in the gen
â  eral fund, it may be easily dissipated if
the present legislators' disregard the Con
troller's recommendations. To show to
what extent his estimate of the expenses
of the government has been ignored, 1
call your attention to the following brief
table:
_ Estimated. Tax Levy.

years ending June, 1891. 54, 144,520 00 |5,022,010

years ending June, 1899. 6,027.164 16 5,107,204 !
The estimate for 1896 (after I had been !
in office two years) was less by over a 'â 
million dollars than the estimate of 1894, I
and the tax levy law cut this down by !
nearly a million more. It was the first I
I reduction in the estimate since ISSS, al- i
though the State is now on a cash basis
and has more institutions and many more
wards to maintain.
In accordance
with my avowed
policy, 1 have ve
toed a large num
ber of appropria
tion billsand items.
This was necessary

*-. <â 
I limit, to provide for proper past
claims, to place the State on a cash basis,
and to prevent the constant exhaustion
of the genera] fund.
While the veto of items may or may
not have been included in the tax levy
bill, still each appropriation, and each
itemâ had it been allowedâ would finally
have become a claim against the treasury
and been paid by a tax upon the people.
The vetoes for the sessions of 1595 and
1897, inclusive, amounted to $4,421,210 73, of
which four millions is a saving to the
people.
Yet when we consider the liberality with
which appropriations have been allowed j
during this administrationâ the debris
fund, $250,000! improvements of our chan
nels and rivers, $300,000; the establishment
of a normal school at San Diego, addi
tional buildings elsewhere, a university
tax of 2 cents in place of 1, and an in
crease of revenue sufficient to place the
State on a cash basis and pay off the
deficiencies and debts of previous admin
istrationsâit cannot be claimed that the
veto power was too severely used, al
though the amounts exceeded the com
bined vetoes of all other Governors of the
State of California.
This saving of over four millions of dol
lars by vetoes in two sessions, or, an
amount sufficient to conduct the ordi
nary expenses of the State, other than
schools, for one full year, is a matter of
no little satisfaction to myself, and of ma-
I terial benefit to the taxpayers of the
I State.
At the close of each session of the Leg
islature, and usually upon the last day
MiP as â¢ hat is known 'is the tax levy
bill. This bill provides that the Board of
Equalization shall raise: For the general
fund a certain amount named; for the in

named; for the school fund a certain
amount named. It further provides that
5 per cent shall be allowed for defaults.

trollera report for IS-J6.) Yet the first
year after my inauguration the board
dropped the valuation to $1,133,282 013 in
consequence of which the rate per "one
hundred dollars of valuation was 6SM>
cents though under the least valuation
for the preceding four years it would have
been much lower than this.
The year following, owing to differences
In the board, the valuation was restored
to Its normal figure, being H,266,593 065
and the tax rates sunk to 42.9 cents on 'the
one hundred dollars, the lowest tax rate
ever reached in the State of California
The following year the valuation of
property was dropped again, and the rate
forced to 51 cents upon the one hundred
dollars.
This year certain members of the Board
<â¢(" Equalization telegraphed to Boards of
Supervisors sugesting they ask for a re
duction in the valuation in their counti.<
and many counties were reduced This
kind of equalization is very injurious to
the. State.
A high tax rate is injurious to any State
because people abroad, seeking "invest
ment, ask the rate, and do not understand
the causes that have led a Board of
Equalization to play battledore and shut
tlecock with State values. They do not
understand the combinations of equaliz
ers. They do understand, however, that
the constant shrinkage of values would
ordinarily indicate a retrograding instead
of a progressing State, and that low tax
rates destroy property as a basis for
loans.
The amount provided to be raised for
the forty-ninth fiscal year by the tax lew
law was $5,010,000. The tax rate was 5"l
cents. The amount provided by the same
law to be raised for the fiftieth fiscal year
is $5,010,000. exactly the same as that for
the forty-ninth fiscal year, and yet the
tax rate is 48.8 cents. Thus to raise the
same amount, a change of value makes a
difference of 2.2 cents in the tax rate.
1 hope the Legislature may find some
means of correcting this evil.
T d. sire, in passing, to state that the
amounts of the last three tax levy bills
are over a million three hundred thousand
dollars less than the pledge of my party.
On this subject I call attention to my
former recommendation:
"To equally and fairly provide for and
collect the revenue necessary for the sup
port of the Government is always the
I most serious duty of the State. The bur
i den of taxation so easily falls upon the
I material and tangible things, the real and
! personal property of a community, tnat
j the tendency is to levy upon such prop-
I erty-holding class an unjust share of
I taxation. Another numerous class of our
i people, in addition to such property, and
I often almost exclusive of it, are granted
! and enjoy under our laws an cx
i tremely valuable possession in the nature
of corporate rights, privileges and immu
nities. Such corporate advantages are
always beneficial, and often the source of
great profit. This class of property is
very difficult to assess or value, and it
| generally falls to contribute its just share
of revenue for the support of that gov
ernment by tiie sanction of which alone
it enjoys its existence. Our constitution
makers undoubtedly contemplated that
this class should be taxed for the benefit
of the State. I would, therefore, recom
mend that, under section 11, article XIII,
of the constitut.on, you formulate and Im
pose upon all corporations in this
State doing business for profit a gradu
ated income tax, so adjusted that they be
required to pay only such sums as are
strictly Just and fair, and that equal Jus-

the matter be solved.
The extent to which personal pronerty
of a peculiar kind escapes taxation is
showu by a reference to seventy-one es
tates in California, and by comparison of
the appraised value of this class of prop
erty with its assessed valuation for taxa-

One decedent paid taxes on $19,729 of
personal property, whereas his personal
estate was appraised shortly afterward
at $6,684,914 28. Another paid taxes on
$oS7n, while his estate was appraised at
$1,41*2.209 S2.
And of the seventy-one estate? the ap
praisement of personality was $11,945,205*),
as against an assessed valuation of $188,
--414, and nearly a million of the personal
ity escaped assessment entirely.
There are two States in the Unionâ New
Jersey and Pennsylvaniaâ which do not
tax lands or the improvements thereon at
all for State purposes; their taxation laws
have been in operation for many years
and have stood the tests of State and na
tional courts. They place the burden
where it belongs.
This is the most important board of the
State. Under its eye must pass every item
of expenditure from the general fund, ex
cept those of the National Guard.
A hurried glance at the proceedings be
fore any Board of Examiners during the
past eight years will prove the import

use, but was de
ted in the Sen
ate. I succeeded, however, in having
grafted upon the general appropriation
bill a clause known as the "one-twenty
fourth clause-, " by which all institutions
and departments, unless excepted there
from expressly, should expend one-twen
ty-fourth part nru.- of the two years' ap
propriation during any one month. This
gave to the board absolute control over
these expenditures, and concerning the
clause the report of the present board
says:
"Section 4â General appropriation and
the one-twenty-fourth proviso: In years
prior to the adoption of the one-twenty
rourth clause. State institutions frequently
overdrew their accounts, and toward the
end of the fiscal year the Board of j-x
--aminers would be c,ompelle3 to grant them
deficiences, as prisons arfd insane asylums
could not be closed and inmates turned
out. These grants ranged from live thou
sand to ninety thousand dollars for each
institution. This year not one institution
asked for a deficiency, as the board kept
strict watch on their monthly demands
and they kept within their limit."
The session of 1895 allowed over one
hundred thousand dollars deficiencies to
institutions alone, not including officers.
This year not a single institution has ap
plied for a deficiency. The financial con
dition of State institutions in this regard
from the forty-fifth to the fiftieth year
is shown in the folowing table:

State officers

rs of the
Board of Ex a min
ers, but if the Leg
islature decides
that it must consist of them, then
the officers should be the Controller, the
Secretary of State and the Governor. The
one State officer who might, in any case,
advantagr-ously serve on the board is the
Controller, because of his position as su
perintendent of finance.
I would recommend that the Governor
and two State officers, to be designated by
him, shall constitute a Central State
Board, with full powers to advertise, and
let contracts, for all State supplies, with
the right of accepting all bids or any
parts thereof, for one or all of
them. That all State buildings, If
the cost is to succeed the sura
of $5000, be planned and constructed
under the provisions of an act with all the
guarding clauses of the building act of
1876, the Governor and other members of
the board to be the officers who shall ap
prove the plans and specifications thereof
â¢and changes therein, and they shall also
finally approve the letting of any contract
to any bidder for the construet.ioi of said
building or Â»ny part thereof.

I .
The Ferry Building.
In this connection I -wish to state that
the San Francisco Hoard of Harbor Com
missioners have not acted under the act
of lhlG. .In lÃTtn I endeavored as Governor
to have the Harbor Commissioners pro
ceed under said act, and urged that they
do so. The Attorney General of the State,
W. F. Fitzgerald, also Rave his opinion
that the act of 1876 was the one under
â which they should proceed. They refused
to comply with the act of IS7O. either as
to the original pinna or the specifications
thereof. As Governor, I further objected
to members of the board expending on
that building, foundation and superstruc
ture an amount in excess of $600,000, which
I deemed the full amount contemplated
by the people for that purpose. Acting
under legal advice, the then board, not
being of my appointees, again failed to
comply with my desires, and the Harbor
building, foundations and superstructure
were contracted for and constructed at a
cost of about $1,000,000, and not in any
manner under the act of 1876. I brought
the matter to the attention of the Legis
lature in my biennial of 1897, but it de
clined to interfere with the action of the
board (which was not of my appointment)
or to change the laws. Modification-! of
the original plans were made by a resolu
tion of the board in January, 1597, which !
modifications are the basis of the changes
made thereafter. The construction of this ]
building from the time it was authorized

f quired to equalize
such wages so that equal services shall
receive equal pay by those employed in
conducting the State's business. It can
not be done now because there is no cen- â¢
tral board with full powers, and the local
pressure is often too great for the local
officials to withstand. In this connection, !
I desire to say that I appealed {<> the
Legislature in my biennial message to :
permit the State Board of Examiners to
limit the number of employes on the
water front of San Francisco and to
regulate their wages. I recognized that
when, in March, IS9O, a Democratic Board
of Harbor Commissioners turned the of-
Sees over to their successors they had
massed for the State and there was in the
treasury the sum of $190,000. and that such
moneys which had formerly been col- ;
licted would not be saved under the sys
tem in vogue. The Legislature again re- !
fused to allow the Board of Examiners i
to interfere with the employes of the Re
publican Harbor Commissioners, as they
had done two years before.
Unifoim Bookkeeping.
This central board should have the j
power of adopting a uniform system of
bookkeeping for the institutions of the
State It is one of our most needed re
forms.
The central board should be given en
larged powers of inquiry, general and j
supervisorial powers over all the institu-
Uons of the State, and appellate powers
over the action of any board. The Legis
lature will recognize, as I said in my in
augural, that the Governor is held re
sponsible in the eye of the people for the
conduct of the State, and especially of his
appointees, and therefore should have
some power over them.
It Is also a fact that It is the duty of !
the Legislature to legislate for and of i
the executive branch of the government
to carry on its institutions, and the I
sooner this is clearly considered and de- j
fined the better for the State it will be
in many respects.

The fruit products of this State havi,
advanced within the last few years be
yond all hope of home consumption: and
unless a foreign market can be obtained
the trees or vines, as the case may be, will
have to be cut down and the lands used
for other purposes.
At a meeting of the Board of Repents
on the 13th of last December, one of its
most careful and conservative members
Regent Hallidle, stated that of our fruits
shipped abroad much was infested with
scale, and for these reasons was rejected.
If publications be correct, the markets
â¢if the Old World are being closed against
us by reason of this same lack of care,
or worse, on the part of our shippers.
Within the last month a report came
from Mexico of the seizure of California
wines because of their injurious adultera
tion. When the battleship Wisconsin wa.3
launched in San Francisco recently a
prejudice against our wine made itself
manifest, as the people from the East who
christened the ship did so with wines of
foreign production.
At the Peace Jubilee our wines were
excluded from the list. During the last
session of the Legislature a pure wine
law bill was passed, which I could not
approve because of its manifest Imperfec
tions. I would recommend that a law
be enacted making it a felony or a mis
dexneanorâin the discretion of the trial
courtâ for any person to ship to a foreign
market, either intentionally or through
criminal negligence, diseased fruits or
adulterated wine or food.
No improvement can be made on the
pure food law of March 26, 1895. The law
is short and comprehensive. It has ac
complished great good since its passage,
and should this Legislature impose on the
State and local Boards of Health the en
forcement of the same it will accomplish
all that can be desired by the most en
thusiastic advocates of food regulations.
Your honorable
body should cer
tainly consider the
passage of some
proper quarantine
law for cattle. This
subject has been
the cause of much
hard work on the
-Â» : *â  part of State offi
cials and boards. Twice have eminent
physicians been sent to Washington, D.
D., in the hope of bettering our condition.
Twice it has been necessary to request
District Attorneys to enforce strictly the
criminal statute of 1893. and almost con
stantly the executive of the State, or the
Secretary of State Board of Health, has
been engaged in correspondence and in
vestigations on the subject. The present
quarantine law is Insufficient. Under the
opinion of the Attorney General of this
State the contagious disease fund is ap
plicable to contagious or Infectious dis
eases of human beings only. A taw should
be passed giving full power to the State
Board of Health to employ such assist
ance as may be necessary, and the mon
eys in the contagious disease fund should
be made to apply i:, cases of cattle quar
antine in the same manner and to the
same extent that they now do in cases
of human quarantine.
The Department of Agriculture has re
lieved our condition. Its agents, with
those of the State, have worked diligent
ly. The quarantine lines, to meet the
varying conditions, have .been changed
but we have no proper laws to protect
these lines. During the dry season I was
compelled to appeal to the Governors of
other States for permission to transport
and feed inspected cattle in their States
Had the cattlemen of California seen the
necessity for action in this matter
sooner and aided the efforts of the exec
utive to secure the passage of a proper
law as recommended, they would not
have suffered so severely during the last
dry season.
It may seem peculiar that a State
which has spent on agricultural societies
within a few years $1,054,229 should not
have on the statute books a proper law
to protect its cattle, horses, sheep or
other animals or fowls, yet such is the
fact, and under the law public funds can
not be directly used for such protection.
During this administration the subject
of health has been much discussed in the
State, owing to the passage of pure food
laws by the Legislature, and the energet
ic and untiring efforts of the San Kran
cisco Board of Health., which has estab
lished and enforced the best sanitary reg
ulations in. that city.
I again call at
tention to the nui
sance at Polsom.
The Stata Board
of Health has pro
nounced against it
and called atten
tion to the un
healthy condition
_. â¼ of affairs existing
there. The last Legislature failed
to provide means to remedy the evil,
though it was recommended. A deficien
cy was allowed in June. IS9<V by the State
Board of Examiners for this purpose. It
has not been used, as the board pre
ferred to lay the matter before the Legis
lature. This evil should be remedied, for
there is no reason why the waters of a
stream from which the people of the cap
ital pump water for domestic purposes
should be polluted in this manner.
Prior to 1889, there were in California
but eleven State institutions. The popu
lation of these was but 5479. With inex
pensive additions to the buildings and a
few more attendants the State could have
handled the natural increase of inmates
for twenty years. The Legislature passed
laws increasing the asylums from three
to five, although it had been reported two
years previous by the superintendent of
the Stockton Asylum that that institu
tion had carried on its records for many
years a large number of inmates not en
titled to admission thereto. If we must
retain this class in State institutions it
should be in one not designated as an in
sane asylum.

and valuable improvements which have
been mad.- for the benefit and welfare of
tin- city's wards.
I call attention to rerommendations on
this subject in my rirst biennial, as I be

an>i a series of buildings have been
ned without the Regent 3;
calling: on the State for one dollar beyond
tne actual appropriation, the Regents
naving regarded the request of the exec
utive that the construction be under the
provisions of the building act of 1876.
J he liberality of the Legislature is ap
preciated bj the people of this State. It
was a proud occasion when one of the
first graduates of the University of Cali
fornia, could, as its Governor, sign such
a. law, and. as president of its Regents,
assist in putting- it into â  effect Besides
tnls - ! indlng the uni
versity crippled for funds, passed a bill
providing that 2 cents should be raised./
for the university in place of the 1 cent,
it had had before. This bill passed unani
mously, and, whore so many aided man
iullv in the good cause, it would be im
possible to give special credit, butâ as
every member of the Legislature will
recognizeâ the unanimity with which tha
bill was passed was largely duo to the ef
forts of Assemblyman Wright of Alameda.,
Since these two generous acts thp strides
of the university have been powerful, and
with the new vigor instilled and the
younger blood to be infused, we may ex
pect this institution, so long conducted
with such care and propriety, soon to
take its place among the great universi
ties of the world. For its material, sys
tematic and harmonious growth we are
largely indebted to our private citizens.
In the name of the State I desire to
publicly thank Mrs. Phebe Hearst, Mir*
Jennie Flood, Louis Sloss, the Alaska Seal
Company and others for their munificent
gifts to this great institution during my
administration.

Our Normal Schools.
Our normal work has greatly improved
under the new laws. Each institution is
better and stronger than ever before, and
its attendance much larger. The presi
dents all commend the new law, which
has enabled them to work in so much
unison and to such great advantage. I
cannot better express my opinion on this
subject than in the language of the re
ports herewith transmitted.
The State Prisons.
For the reasons stated In my biennial,
the State prisons should be consolidated.
The Legislature should close San Quen
tin, enlarge Folsom and turn one of our
reform schools into a prison for first
termers. In any event, one of our reform
schools should be turned into a prison for
first-termers, work given, to fit them for
honest employment, and 10 per cent of
their earnings laid aside with which to
start in life when their terms have ex
pired.

this State are mat

demnation. The
practice not only
fills our prisons,
but shuts out hope
from the offenders.

That is loud praise, but the great
specific for all kinds of nervous debility
that is owned alone by the celebrated
doctors of the Hudson Medical Institute

You may be a weak, half-paralyzed

can do what no other remedy â stop "
the mischief in a month., Drains do
cease in ten days â they DO â
and life, light and full, unutterable joy
come back like sunshine after rain. Try
it at once, and then you will be one

ature -If the Governor is to be held
rftoponsible for the conduct of the depart

j should be given control of those function
aries, etc. Such control has net been
given.
I appealed to the last two Legislatures
i to pass some law empowering the Gover
nor to control' the institutions and point
ed out how much I had been embarrass-d
by the lack of such laws. Both Legisla
tures refused to pass the requisite bills
and I found myself helpless when occa
sions arose for severe and determined
treatment.
If abases exist they are the direct re
sult of such failure to pass the bills rec
ommended. I again recommend that "for
cause an<l tfpon a hearing" the Governor
be given the power to remove his own
appointees. .
.What 'it tie power a Governor now has
was exemplified by the matter connected
.with the San I- ranctsco water front until
it became Democratic. I have discussed
the subject In my remarks concerning a

They will begin by attacking the amount
apportioned by an administration as ex
cessive. The Controller says: "The

amount to be raised fr>c the State school
fund by aft ad valorem tax is seren uot
lars for each census child between the
f 5 and 17 years, which census is re
i to the Controller by the Superin
tendent of Public Instruction On or be
fore the 10th day of August of each year."
And again: "The census returns of uSS
1 made by the County Superintendent and
reported by the Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction give the aggregate num
ber of school children of the requisite age
as 374,624. The amount necessary to be
raised by the tax levy for each of the
fifty-first and fifty-second fiscal years is
52.622.3t5." (Report of 1898.) Previous re
ports ;ire to the same effect, smowing tOat
the amount raised is a matter of calcula
tion merely.
The fact that my second year required
only $2,195,435. while my successor's first
' year will require for this fund $426,909 in
1 excess of this amount, or nearly a million
more in the next two years, is a matter
of calculation only, with which he has no
1 more to do than with the increase of cen
sus children. Neither can he thereby bo
charged with extravagance, because the
I same is not included in the general cost
of the government. If any one objects to
the Increased amount paid Into the school
fund, he must reduce the amount per
scholarâ or reduce the scholars.
I am proud of the fact that the only tax
funds of my term that have in any way
: equaled those of my predecessor's term
are the school fund, where of necessity
and without my c '-operation the expendi
ture has been over a. million more than
i his. and the university fund, where we
have increased the tax one cent. The
other two tax funds, the interest and the
general, have been much lower.
The State Printer.
In his report of IS9<> the State Printer
said the Legislature of 1597 could easily
save $20,00) in its printing bills. The same
Legislature's experts pointed out how
from $15.0t>.' to $20,000 more, also, might be
saved. Neither suggestion was acted on.
The Legislature appropriated for the
State Printing Office.
Firstâ Forty thousand dollars for the
school book fund. This was not
: needed. The revolving fund was sufficient
ly full for all practical purposes. The Con
troller had stricken this item from his es
timates as unnecessary, and this year
omits a recommendation In its favor." My
i veto of this item was a saving of $40,000,
which added to the above admitted possi
ble savings â¢would aggregate nearly $80,000
had there been any desire to economize.
Secondâ The Legislature also included
an item of $275,000 for the printing office.
This amount was sufficient to conduct the
office until the session of the present Leg
: islature only. This appears from the re
| port of the State Printer of 1896, page 11.
The Legislature
of 1>95 had' appro
priated for the
printing office $250.
--000 originally, and
the session of 1897
added to this $K>.-
GBO for completing
the work to June
30, 1897, a total of
1 $332,000â an immense sum, the benefits Â«,f
which are not so easily seen. To this was
added $40,000 more for the school book
fund, or $J72.000 for this office. With all
: this appropriation, marvelous as it may
seem, the office did not finish its work
''. that year.
I vetoed this last item of J27.1.000 appro
priated by the Legislature of 1897. It was
: excessive. Since July 1. 1897. we have had
I no State printing, and there has been no
! great inconvenience. All the necessary
: printing of the different tax departments
' of the State, and all that is necessary to
be printed of th<- reports, could have been
done during this period for iess than $58,
--'â¢ 000. Of course, printing cannot be done
â  cheaply if the printer he compelled, as
now. to do all kinds of work requested by
the various offices and institutions, nor it
they are able to make of the printing of
i fice a stationery establishment, nor. yet,
! If legislators can carry their friends on
the printer's list, or interfere with his
appropriations in case he refuses 10 com
i ply with their equpsts.
: The Printer should do no.ne of the work
for institutions like the State Library,
the Harbor Commissioners, the Bank
commissioners, the Building and Loan
Commissioners and the numerous other
boards which are not supported by a tax
ion the people. Th^y have their sources
of revenue separate and apart from or
dinary State revenues and should pay for
their printing and binding therefrom.
Each institution or officer accorded
printing privileges should have Charged
to his appropriation the printing as he
now has charged any other article he
buys. My veto has demonstrated the
cheapness with which the work can be
: done in this manner.
In passing I would say that the State
Printer was willing to print in advance
work for the Legislature that could not
regularly be ordered for it prior to its
except by common consent.
Exorbitant
Charges
for Printing.
He was willing to print, also, for thi
of other officials certain reports, noi
whii'h, under the law. are for del

matters he was supported by the 81
Hoard of Examiners, t.ut some members

â¦ â¦" the finest public
roads in the mountains. I had honed be
fore this to have seen completed the
model road from Sacramento to Folsom,
thus leaving a gap of but thirty miles,
which the State and counties could have
! during the next two years. In es
tablishing a rock crusher at Folsom and
approving the Goods Roads Commission
law I had in view a nucleus for a great
m of highways for this State.
!:â¢ ad-building has been so crude that
the money spent thereon annually (about
one million seven hundred thousand dol
lars i appeared largely lost. To start upon
a road system in all directions would be
too great an undertaking; but to begin
with a well planned road like the Tahoe
one. to establish a rock crusher that
could force down the price of rock values
in Sacramento, Stockton, Marysville and
elsewhere, to later build a model road to
Folsom, join it with the Placervllle road,
and to add to this in time one from Sac
ramf-nto to Stockton, thence down the
valley, then from Sacramento north,
would establish the backbone of a road
system with great possibilities.
As Sacramento County cannot vote
bonds for its sh;ire of the road to Folsom
under a Supreme Court decision, the State
should build the road itself.
The im p r ove
ment of the navi
gable rivers and
harbors of a State
is a matter for the
National Govern
ment. For years,
however, the ap
proprlat ions for
-â¢ t- the improvement
of the navigable waters of the Sacra
mento. San Joarjuin and other channels
leading into the bays of San Fnu.
Suisun and San Pablo have been 50 small
as not to meet requirements. For this
reason In my first biennial message I
recommended!
Rivers and
Harbor
Improvement
"This State has in recent years expend
ed millions of dollars in the construction
and furnishing of buildings, and in their
maintenance, for the benefit of the wards
of the State. It has expended thousands
of dollars under a Commission of Public
Works, under the act of ISM: and in 1593
passed a law providing for the expendi
ture by a Debris Commissioner of a quar
ter of a million of dollars for the pro
tection of the sources of our rivers, while
upon the navigable portion of those rivers
themselves they have not expended for
years past one dollar. Our rivers are the
natural arteries of the State for com
merce. South of the Tehachapi the
southern harbors have and will receive
millions of dollars from the National Gov
ernment. To the north. Humboldt har
bor has received large sums for its im
provement from the same source. For
the mining interest Congress voted $250,000
and our State $2."0.0O0, or half a million. Yet
these great arteries of commtn-e remain
practically neglected. The great valleys
of th" State contain of available land
25,000,000 arable acres, and through them
flow these mighty rivers, daily being
ruined by neglect. The improvement of
these rivers should be by the National
Government, but where it hesitates, nay,
halts, when it should begin, the State
ought to step in and do the work itself.
The entire State is deeply interested in
this subject, and I recommend to your
honorable bodies that you consider thia
matter carefully, devise ways and means
of giving our interior the roiiof it needs
and enact a law carrying a proper appro
priation for that purpose."
The Legislature, by the act of 1*97 ap
propriated $300,000, which was expended as
follows. I cannot give better results than
in the concise language of the board
"lt Is estimated that to complete the
work now under contract will bring th*
total expenditures up to $125,000. leaving
a balance in the appropriation of $175 000
"The Jurisdiction of this department
should be extended so as to include all
of the Sacramento. San Joaquin Feather
and Tuolumne rivers and Petafuma Al
viso and Napa creeks. The State should
take upon Itself the responsibility of im
proving these streams as well as com
pleting the work already recommended
by this department. The Improvements
suggested would involve an expenditure
not to exceed $200,000 and would result in
a great saving in the cost of transporta
tion and a material Improvement in the
commercial and industrial conditions oÂ£
the State."
I indorse the recommendations and ap
prove the work and am pleased that a
start has been made In the right direc
tion. All navigable waters entering into
the bays of San Francisco, San Pablo and
Suisun should be included. Ten per cent
of the receipt of harbor dues of San
Francisco should be paid into a State
fund to be expended in improving the
navigable waters leading into San Fran
cisco Bay.
In my biennial I
said:
"I favor placing
the insane asylums
and other similar
institutions of the
State absolutely
upon a civil service
basis and will co
operate with your
â â¦ â ; â¦-
Introduction

-â¦ â : â¦-
honorable bodies to that end," etc.
I advocated the clause placing our hos
pitals for the Insane under civil service.
It is now a part of the asylum laws of
the State.
The State normal schools have been
placed on even a better basis.
My request to the Board of Prison Di
rectors is shown by their report:
"Among the praiseworthy acts of your
administration we are confident that you
will look back with more satisfaction to
none than the effort you have made to
remove the prisons of this State from
politics. At the outset you advised the
members of our board that it was your
wish that no official ithat was performing
his duties acceptably should be disturbed
in his position. This rule it has been our
pleasure to enforce. As a result we can
report that the efficiency of the service
at both prisons has never before reached
so high a point, and that this is due to
the fact that subordinates understand
that their tenure of office depends en
tirely en their own trustworthiness, there
can be no manner of doubt. Having some
personal knowledge on the subject we un
hesitatingly assert that the prisons are
th- last institutions in which the official
lists fhould be held out as prizes for
political service. Men who are capable of
dealing with the complex problems of
convict life are rare, and when found
should not be displaced."
Whenever spoken to on this subject by
trustees of State institutions I have in
sisted that none but competent persons
be employed and that wherever an In
competent person was found working for
the State that person should be dis
charged, no matter hy whom recommend
ed. I have refrained, except in a few in
stances, from making recommendations
tion of my inaugu
ral I have made a
careful study of
our institutions. I
have devoted the
full time of my en
tire term to the
duties of my office.
and am one of the few Governors of this
St,it^ who has given up his occupation to
A Farewell
From
the Governor
I had two legislative sessions, both Re
publican, with which to work in chang
ing old and framing new laws.
When the last Legislature adjourned
in 1887 my functions as a part of the law
making power ceased, and my duties be
came solely executive, largely of detail,
and as easily performed from Stockton
and San Francisco as at Sacramento.
Until the close of the session of 1*97 ray
time was devoted to studying State in
stitutions, their needs, the laws govern
ing them and the manner in which other
laws could benefit the people. During this
period I passed every hour possible â both
day and nightâ in Sacramento on State
affairs.
At the sessions of 1595 and ISÂ£*7 many
bills of my suggesting and my devising
were passed.
Of the seventeen State institutions
thirteen were beneficially affected there
by and ten were reorganized.
Laws affecting pure food, our dairies
good roads, requiring inventories of State
property, advancing the interests of the
university and appropriating money for
its colleges, placing asylums and the nor
mal school? under systematic laws.
Glen Ellen and the reform schools under
tax-saving laws, repealing the coyote bill
and the Indigent fraud, reducing the ex
penses of the government and placing it
on a cash basis, and improving the Sac
ramento and the San Joaquin rivers, are
a few of those that received my active
support.
How ill I became is a matter of general
knowledge. When, and only when, the
session of 1897 closed did I obey the per
emptory orders of my physician. Sacra
mento remained my official residence, as
it is the official residence of al! State of
ficers, but as latd laws provided, my
home, like the home and voting place of
other officers, was elsewhere.
I have devoted my strength to the wel
fare of the State, and although, on ac
count of illness, granted a leave or ab
sence I remained to discharge my duties
in answering- the call of the President of
these United States for volunteers.
I lay down the office without health or
practice. I hope my successor may not j
be compelled to hew each step of his four
years through adverse Legislatures to
maintain his pledges to the people.

the exhaustions of the general fund and
the transfers of moneys alluded to:

On the 11th of April, 1593, I transferred
from other funds to the general fund
$300.000 to prevent the latter from becom
ing exhausted until after the May settle
ments. Again, on September 1, 1884, I
transferred $710,000 from other funds, and
on November 16, 1894, an additional $150.
--000 in order to carry the general fund on
a paying basis until the December settle
ments of that year. But for this action
the fund would have become exhausted
on the 7th of Sepiember, and before pay
merits could have been resumed the fund
would have been overdrawn to the extent
of about J593.000. Very truly,
E. P. COLGAN. Controller.
It will be noticed that the small balance
left me by my predecessor caused the
fund to be exhausted twice before my nrst
tax moneys came in.

fl WORD TO REPUBLICANS.
THE.campaign of 1900 is aiready above the hori
zon. Everything done by the Republican party,
where it has power to do, affects it for good or
ill everywhere. It won in last year's elections by a
j margin so narrow as to establish a practical equality
lof chances for 1900. That equality is to be changed
; to a balance for or against the party during the next
twelve months. The change will be wrought by the
! account it makes of its stewardship to its master?, the
I people. Every party act in municipal. State and na
tional administration will go to judgment. Every
ober of the party has its iate in his hands. The
natural growth of commerce and prevailing business
prosperity wi!! not offset acts of folly and crime in
tl:e official ranks of the party in power. It is history
that the Democratic party has not secured a popular
majority for a Presidential candidate who was in
dorsed by Tammany. The misrule of New York City
bj that potent organization has been made known in
every corner of the country. Its disregard of decency,
its biindness to public and private morality, its brutal
use of power, have been a curse to the party to which
it pr ( giance.
When Tilden was nominated against its opposition,
and against a right carried by John Kelly to the floor
of the national convention, and renewed in the State
o'" New York by every form of treachery and bolting,
he carried a popular majority, and narrowly missed
being President, through a decision ot the Electoral
Commission.
Cleveland was nominated in ISS4 against Tam
many, which deserted him in the campaign and se
cretly threw its vote to General Butler. But he was
elected against the strongest man thefountry had to
oppose hi]
He -.vas renominated in 18SS against Tammany, and
its treachery in New York lost him that State and de
feated him. In 1892 the Chicago convention was held
until 2 o'clock in the morning by the Tammany tight
against Cleveland, and its most persuasive and im
passioned orator held the stage down to the rollcall
S ites to pour out Tammany's embittered hatred
of the man, who was immediately nominated and tri
umphantly elected, because, in General Bragg's terse
aphorism, "the people loved him for the enemies he
had made."
This history proves that even the Democracy re
volt against chicane, corruption and indecency com
mitted by a tocal organization in their party name.
Let no man deceive himself by believing that Repub
:.re less nice in their preference for what is
clean and upright, and in their aversion to what is
low, brutal and treacherous. With Quay in a crim
inal court, and Dan Burns exchanging cells in three
jails for a seat in the Senate, with betrayal of the hon
est hope and affront to the self-respect and pride of
the people, the Republican party will go into the cam
paign of 1900 morally handicapped and a likely loser.
We are painfully p.ware that it is said in California
that The Call, by standing against the evil influences
that seek to control the party, and by doing what it
can to install a decent regard for public opinion in
the party counc: ing Democratic politics,"
but .ye deny the hard impeachment. Every Repub
lican, in private life or public office, who degrades his
party by indorsing corruption, by electing a dis
graced, ignorant and unfit man to the Senate, by dis
appointing the generous confidence of the people, is
making Democratic politics, not The Call.
Every Republican who does, or indorses in others,
that which affronts decency and offends cleanness,
which cannot be defended by any self-respecting man
or newspaper, is making Democratic politics, not The
Call.
Every Republican paper which is silent while of
fenses are committed, and makes offenders feel safe
through failure to expose them, is making Demo
cratic politics, not The C

than the election of Burns, than the beginning of a
legislative session by an act for which no right rea
son can be given, for which no apology can be con
structed, for which the party must hang its head in
shame?
We desired to see this State administration, which
h in power by such a hearty vote of confidence, sue
along the lines that appeal to the sentiment
which trusted it and gave it public authority. We
hope to see the Governor, in his powerful and digni
fied office, the trustee of the best sentiment among
the people, following that light and leading which
they believed themselves to be following when they
gratified his ambition. We hope to see the Repub
lican government of California look over the heads of
greed and grudge in the crowds that are self-seeking
at the capital to the patient, trusting, confiding and
worthy people of the State, who want no office, but
can give it and take it away at the ballot-box, and
among them make Republican politics for Califor
nia and the nation in 1000 and forevermore.
SEAWELL'S GAS DECISION.
THE decision rendered by Judge Seawell in the
proceeding brought to break the contract for
public lighting awarded on August 16 last to the
Gas and Electric Company establishes several prin
ciples which are bound ultimately to become valuable.
For oqe thing, he holds that no public contract for
lighting with gas or electricity can be awarded by the
Board of Supervisors for a longer period than one
year. For another he decides that proposals adver
tised by the Supervisors which exclude competition
are illegal, and that any contract framed under them
is void.
These two principles, unlike the others declared in
the Summerhayes suit, are basic. An illegal .method
of advertising may be corrected, or a contract void
icr uncertainty, or which contains error?, may be re
drawn and made effective. But the one year limit
requires a new contract to be made every season, thus
introducing frequent changes and giving the city the
benefit of whatever reduction takes place in the price
of gas and electricity, and the declaration that com
petition cannot be excluded, no matter what the cir
cumstances, places all bidders on an equal footing.
A recital of the facts connected with the contract
thus expounded will show how valuable these prin
ciples really are. When the contract came before the
Supervisors for award the Mutual Electric Light
Company offered to give the city a rate not only less
than that offered by the Gas and Electric Company,
but in consideration of getting the contract it agreed
to make a reduction of 25 per cent to consumers.
But the company asked as a condition precedent that
ie be allowed to erect poles. It is now competing with
the old company with underground conduits, the
cost of maintaining which places it on an unequal
footing.
The Supervisors, however, declined to grant the
privilege asked and awarded the contract to the old
concern on the ground that the Mutual Company, be
ing unable by its own confession to supply all depart
ments of the city government, was not a qualified
bidder. Judge Seawell has knocked this position
cold. He declares that the Supervisors have no au
thority to create a condition and then make it a pre
text for excluding competition in lighting the streets

i and municipal buildings. If one company has poles j
! dp it cannot take advantage of that fact to create a j
1 monopoly and force a price upon the city which a }
j rival concern is willing to fut under it granted a simi- .
j lar privilege. The decision rests upon the broadest j
I lines of good sense and sound public policy.
Judge Seawell's ruling, however, will cost the city
some money. The contract of August 16 has been de
clared void, but under a Supreme Court decision the
j Gas Company can collect the reasonable value of the
light it has already furnished. This will undoubtedly 1
, exceed the price fixed by the contract, and until. the j (
; new Board of Supervisors makes a new agreement the I
treasury will suffer a little. But the decision is , '
I worth all it can possibly cost. Monopoly in street- (
! lighting is pretty effectually broken up by it, and that
, is a result that must eventually save millions to the '
I taxpayers. i
MfIJOR MCLAUGHLIN'S POSE.
IF the Examiner is to be trusted, which is doubtful.
Major McLaughlin has been posing at Sacramento
as the most asinine guy of the season. According I
to that unreliable journalj the Major stated in a re- !
| cent interview that Republican success in this State j
â  at the recent election was due entirely to the State
! Central Committee; that the efficiency of the com
mittee was due mainly to himself; that while Sena
tors and Assemblymen represent only districts, he
represents the whole State; that his friend Burns is
i the ablest and most astute politician in the State, and
that if elected to the United States Senate Burns
would rank with such powers in the party as Hanna,
Elkins. Foraker. Platt and other leaders.
On each of these themes the Major is reported to
have expatiated with all the expansiveness of a laker
' trying to fill space for a yellow journal. The Ex
' aminer quotes him as having said: "That the present
Legislature is Republican is absolutely and entirely
I due to the labor of the State Central Committee."
The Major is thus made to ignore all the-influence of
the splendid administration of McKinley, all the ener
i getic work of local leaders and the rank and file of the
' party, and all the influence of the Republican press of
! the State. He is' reported as claiming that his com
â¢ mittee did it all.
Again, the Major is made to say: "I have devoted
my entire time, day and night, to the interests of the
: Republican party of California. When I was elected
! chairman in 1896 I found it without system of any
I kind whatever, and it stands to-day the most perfect
, political organization existing in any State west of
; the Mississippi. This work was accomplished prac
tically by myself and three members of the past and
: present committee, aided by the constant advice and
' counsel of Colonel Burns."
The Major is then quoted as bursting forth into a
pean of praise for Burns. He is reported to have
said: "I am in favor of the election of Colonel Burns
to the United States Senate. My reasons are many.
but the prime one is the fact that his eminent ser
vices to the party during 1806, and particularly during
the last campaign, entitle him to this honor."
It is hardly credible that Major McLaughlin could
have made such an absurd assertion as that. Bums,
as the owner of a silver mine, was a free silver man in
1896. and did nothing whatever for the election of
McKinley or Republican success in that campaign.
He was for a considerable part of the year in Mexico.
If Major McLaughlin really said any such thing
as the yellow Democratic organ attributes to him on
', this subject he must have meant that Burns rendered
â  an important service to the Republican party in 1806
by keeping in the background on the silver question
and getting out of the country.
It is only fair to Major McLaughlin to assume that
he did not make any of the silly assertions the Ex
aminer attributes to him. If he is really claiming at
; Sacramento that he is bigger than the Senate and the
Assembly combined; that he elected the Republican
ticket and that Burns has rendered valuable service to
the party, then the Major's head has evidently been
. swollen to the size and emptiness of that of a jac'
and he is more kinds of a guy than his closest ac
quaintances have suspected.
THE YUBfl RIVER PROBLEM.
AX element of attraction is to be found in the
proposed scheme to divert the Yuba River
from its course by reason of the very magni
tude of the project. Any enterprise tending to the
rearrangement of nature on a large scale is more or
less fascinating to progressive men. The draining of
vast swamps, the formation of deep, safe harbors in
shallow roadsteads, and the construction of canals
and artificial lakes have all found willing promoters
among energetic communities, and in most cases the
works thus performed have been highly beneficial.
So natural is it for men to delight in enterprises of
this kind, the proposed project will be favorably re
ceived and the plans suggested for carrying it out will
be given attentive consideration. It is not. however,
one which can be wisely undertaken until after the
most elaborate and thorough surveys and calcula
tions. The changing of the course of such a stream
as the Yuba will entail the changing of many other
ffsings besides, and, while most of these changes may
be beneficial, some of them may be harmful in their
operation.
The benefits which are expected to flow from the
completion of the enterprise are many and of great
value. It 'is believed it would enable hydraulic min
ing to be carried on upon a large scale, and at the
same time save the Sacramento River from filling up
with sediment and relieve the residents along a con
siderable stretch of the Sacramento from the neces
sity of constructing costly levees. Each of these re
suits would certainly be of vast benefit to the State,
and, if investigation show that the project is feasible
at an expense not too great, the enterprise will have
a widespread support.
As reported at present the project is too vague to
be decisively discussed, as no estimates of cost have
been made. It is certain, however, that the expense
will be large. The public will, therefore, wait with
interest for more definite reports of the ways and
means of carrying out the project.
Burns is trying to buy his way into the Senate, but
when he seeks to barter away the livings of a lot of
fcithful policemen he adds to the quality of dishonesty
a contemptible form of meanness. However, one
does not expect figs from thistles.
If the witnesses to the Gallagher murder refuse to
talk they can be kept in jail indefinitely for contempt,
so the balking of justice would not be a calamity de
void of mitigating feature?.
The Sacramento Bee has a way of speaking its
mind. If the Burns crowd has failed to note this, it
has missed the opportunity for a great moral up
lifting.
When rogues fall out honest men are supposed to
have a chance, but with Lees and Gunst thicker than
two thieves, the public is bound to suffer.
Perhaps Burns will recall that that other distin
guished Mexican, Henley, wanted something, too,
and didn't get it
A BLACK DAY FOR CALIFORNIA.
The danger that is before the people of the State of California at the
present time is that D. M. Burns will be chosen to the United States
Senate.
He is a candidate in every acceptation of that term. He wants the
position, and he yearns after it with an intense yearning. Great in
fluence, marvelous political power, are at his back.
The Bee believes it would be a black day for California if D. M. Burns
should be chosen to represent her in the council halls of the nation. And
we are confident that the g*eat mass of the people of this State think as
we do upon this subject.
How can that close possibility be averted?
Who, among those mentioned, could the opposition to Burns rally
around with the best chances of a harmonious smoothing of differences,
and with the best prospect of success?
There is only one man peacemaker in the whole list, one man whos*
personality and Influence could be depended upon to bind up the Wroundfl
and heal the sores among the Burns opponents â one man whom that op
position could center around. And that man is Irving M. Scott.
He is the only man who has not been mixed up in factional fights. IU-.
is the only one who has held aloof in recent squabbles. He is the man
of all others who could patch up that wide chasm in San Francisco â a
chasm which almost any other candidate would but still further extf-ml.
The Bee does not know how this Senatorial contest will end. It be
lieves, however, that, were it left to a vote of the people, Irving M. Scott
would lead by a great majority.
The Legislature may yet turn to Irving M. Scott as the compromise
candidate to lead it out of its difficulties. If it does the voters will not
comolain.â Sacramento Bee.
OPEN LETTER
TO MR. CATOR
Hon. T. V. Cator, San Francisco, Cal.:
I am sure you will pardon me for this
seeming presumption In writing to you,
almost a total stranger, yet not wholly
so. I read your very interesting, hon
est and frank letter in The Call that
came yesterday, regarding your pres
ent attitude politically, and the reasons
for your change of base. I congratu
late*---" and I congratulate the Repub
lican party of California. Surely your
ability and influence in the State will
be fraught with satisfactory results. 1
remember well your visits here and
your speeches, that had more influence
in strengthening the backbone of Pop
ulism than all others combined. Per
haps you will remember that you and
I had a few friendly tilts, and I can as
sure you that notwithstanding your
residence in another State, your influ
ence had an overflow into Oregon that
may be felt in the coming campaigns.
I hope we may have the benefit of your
ability and eloquence here, to assist in
undoing what it did on the occasions
mentioned. Of course the conditions
have very materially changed in the
past two years and the financial ques
tion is practically out of the contest.
Mr. Bryan's present attitude is not that
of a statesman, but rather that of a
politician, seeking a blind trail as an
excuse for further existence.
Perhaps our whole history has not
furnished a chapter so condensed and
so plethoric with permanent result and
at the same time having a tendency
to so completely wipe out troublesome
false issues, and to dim party lines, as
the past year. Our nag has a more
sutreestive influence wherever it floats:
MeKinley is the President of the whole
people; there are no personal or parti
san traducers: the country seems pros
porous in every part: every nation on
earth is ready to do us reverence, and
surely we have reason t" expect a
brightness of prosperity that shall il
luminate at least 180 degrees of the
earth's surface. Pardon this writing.
Tours truly. C. B. WATSOX.

FIGHTING A TBUST.
Suit Filed to Dissolve the Giant Pow
der Company.
The long-threatened suit of the People,
on the relation of Attorney General \V. F.
Fitzgerald, instigated on the complaint of
R. W. Collins, against the Giant Powder
Company, to declare the articles of incor- I
poration of the defendant forfeited and I
for the adjudgment of a fine of $5000, was.
filed yesterday.
In the complaint it is alleged that the
defendant corporation haÂ£ entered into j
combinations and conspiracies to form a .
trust for the purpose of unlawfully re
straining trade and maintaining arbitrary
and oppressive rates. For these reasons
, the court is asked to declare the articles
; of incorporation of the company forfeited,
to dissolve the corporation, to fine the of
fending company $5000 and to give ludg
; nient against it for costs and all expanses

CALIFORNIA'S
HALF-CENTURY
CELEBRATION
Committee Call for
Preliminary Work.
TIME TO BEGIN PREPARATIONS
WAR CHANGES THE SCOPE OF
THE EXPOSITION.
Suggestions to Confine It to the Coun
tries of the Pacific and
the Phillipine
Islands.
The proposition to hold a semi-centen
nia! exposition to commemorate the ad
mission of California to the Union of
States, suggested by The Call last spring,
is coming to the fore again. During the
past year, by reason of an active politi
cal campaign, and latterly the prospect
of a continuation of the drought, no
steps have been taken to promote the
idea. The campaign and the drought be
ing now matters of history and the State
promised a us year, the exposi
tion plan is to be taken up and energetic
efforts made to successfully inaugurate
it.
Since the great show was suggested the
United States has concluded a succe^.^
ful war and radically changed the map
in the Pacific islands and the Orient.
This historical fact has naturally led to
the proposal that the exposition be made
not only unique but instructive by mak
ing it a demonstration of the resources
and products of the countries bordering
upon the Pacific and particularly the new
-.ens of Uncle Sam.
It is conceded that this idea properly
carried out in 1901 as a result of the great
changes that will take place by that time
would attract the attention of the whole
civilized world. The war brought San
Francisco into special prominence as the
gateway to the Pacific and the Orient and
the publication to the world that an expo
sition with such an unequaled scope
would be held here would not only at
tract universal interest but insure the
fair being a great success.
In order to give the proposition a proper
start and crystallize some of the ideas
that are now in embryo a meeting of the
committee appointed by Mayor Phelan
last spring has been called by Chairman
Rtinstein to be held at his office this
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
The attention of the members will be
called to the fact that the undertaking
is a stupendous one. worthy of the best
efforts of the ckizens of the Queen City
of the Pacific, and that the time ia ripe
for action. It is naturally expected that
there will be a good attendance of the
committee and that not only will some
valuable suggestions be offered but that
substantial progress will be accomplished.
The committee is composed of J. B.
Relnstem. Mayor Phelan, Charles Bund
schu, A. S. Baldwin, John H. Grady, Gen
eral R. H. Warfield, A. A. Watkins. Wil
liam H. Mills. A. B. Spreckels, Irving M.

A DOG HOSPITAL RAIDED.
W. F. Kennedy Arrested for Starving
Valuable Animals to Death.
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals have
broken up a dog hospital in the Mission
because of the heartless manner in which
the canines were treated. The place was
conducted by John E. Lewis at 2125 Mar
ket street. Lewis lives at T'M Golden Gate
avenue. People living- near the dog hos
pital complained that the dogs were neg
lected for days at a time and the only
food they had was given by those who
could not bear to see- the animals dvine
of starvation. When Officer Walton went
to the place yesterday he found nine dogs
so weak from hunger that they could
hardly stand, and some of the poor beasts
were eating the bodies of a couple of dead
dogs that had perished from want. Wal
ton arrested W. F. Kennedy, who it was
clalmrd had charge of the hospital
Lewis attempted to throw all of the
blame upon Kennedy, saying that he had
disposed of the hospital to him A. n in
spection of the hospital patients showed
that near:y all of them were valuable an
imals that been given into Lewi* 1
care. Lewis' excuse for his neglect after
telling several stories to Secretary Hol
brook. was that he had done all he could
for the dogs but he could not make the
dog hospital pay, and so left its man
agement with Kennedy. ls ma ""

HIS RESPECTS
TO W. H. MILLS
Says He Was Tender
ed a Gold Brick.
NEW BOARD TAKES OFFICE
EDSON ELECTED TO THE CHAIR
MANSHIP.
Clark Gives Some Significant Advice
to the Members of the Incom
ing Railroad Com
mission. ' . â 
mallty
-
Before retiring Chairman La. Ki;e at the
old board took a. parting: Ring at tfae
railroad company tor its insidious sr.d
treacherous course ,in relation to thÂ« 3
per- cent grain rate reduction resolution,
and at the same time explained hi* per
sonal position in regard to the matter.
He opened the proceedir.g.3 by relating _
how the Southern Pacific Company,
through the agency of W. H. Hills,.- at-,
tempted to sell him a gold brick in con
nection with the pending litigation, which â â¢
resulted from the efforts of the commis
sion to reduce grain rates in the State
S per cent. He said:
"It has been published that it was my .
fault that the pending suit was not dis
missed and the farmers thus given the
benefit of the reduction in rates. I sim
ply want to say that I was ready to have
the case dismissed whenever the railroad â 
filed its proposition, as suggested by Jir.
MillÂ«." . " â¢ â¢
For the evident benefit of the new mem
bers Mr. La Rue made the following sig
nificant comment on the pending suit in
the United States Circuit Court regard
ing grain rate reductions: v* -.
"That case if followed up to a conclu- .
sion in the manner it should be will, I
think, establish the fact that the com
miÂ«sion is authorized to make reductions â¢
in freight rates, but until that suit is.
carried" to a determination you will not
be able to do much. I would like to see
it prosecuted to a proper termination. .
Commissioner Clark disavowed any uÂ£
rect knowledge of the railroad offer to
compromise, but intimated that such a
proposition as that mentioned would have
received his support. He then offered this,
sage advice to the new board, voluntarily
and without price:
"My opinion is that there is only one
wav by which the commission can be at
some use to the people of Californiaâ that
is, for the commission to act in co-opera
tion with the railroad. I believe some
good could be accomplished by acting m
unison. If a complaint comes in, take it
to the railroad company."
This suggestion had the remarkable
effect of electrifying Commissioner H:n
ton out of his perennial state of somno
lence and causing him to rejoin: â¢'Why,
under those circumstances this institu-.
tion might just as well be abolished.'
Clark then called attention to the. fact
that the efforts of the commission to reg
ulate the freight rates of the railroad had
already cost the State about $30,000, 'arid
nothing had been accomplished, and
added that it did not pay to fight the
railroad. , - ,'â 'â  â¢*â¢ ''
Chairman La Rue corrected Clark by
stating that the commission had not been
fighting the railroad but that the rail
road had been fighting the commission. - -
After briefly reviewing the work of the
beard for information of the incoming
members and explaining the present
status of matt- pending before the
board. Chairman La Rue. on motion of
Commissioner Clark, declared the old
board adjourned sine die, and the new
board immediately met. y] â â â â  .-â  â¢
The members organized by electing t,.
B. Edson chairman. W. T. Sesnon secre
tary Peter Foley bailiff and James D.
Brown stenographer. The salary of the
secretary is J2*Â» a year, of the bailiff
$1200 and of the .stenographer $500.
\t the afternoon session of the board
it was decided '.o take up the Pullman car
investigation to-morrow afternoon at 1
o'clock. It was also agreed to hold
monthly meetings on the second Monday
of each month, beginning with February.
Chairman Edson was appointed a com
mittee of one to investigate the matter of
the application of the Crescent City and
Smith River Railroad Company to raise
its rates.
Dissatisfaction was expressed over the
small quarters occupied as the offices of
the commission, and the secretary was in- â¢
strutted to look for more commodious
ones during the week. Adjournment was
taken until Thursday afternoon. ..-

Two ocean steamers bearing marks of a

Queen waa caught in a southeaster, and
during it one of the quartermasters was
â¢washed overboard and drowned. The
Australia ran into a northwester and was
badly kl.im. .
In talking about the trip of the Queen

Charles Richman was the quartermaster
on the bridge, and at 10:30 a. m. he w< i I
down to call the boatswain. Just as he
got in front of the pilot house a bi|
camo over the bow and carried Rt
away.
"He must have been thrown heavily
against the woodwork, for when hi came
up abaft the bridge I .could see the Mood
running out of his mouth and nose." One
side seemed to be paralyzed.. because he
made no motion with one arm. while lie
put the other one out of the water once or
twice. A couple of life preserver^ were
thrown over to him, but he made no effort
to reach them. The steamer was stopped
and we backed and filled for twenty min
utes, but could do nothing more to help
the poor fellow. He came up once or
twice more and then sank forever."
Richman had no relatives here, but
made his home at "The White Cruiser"
Hotel on East street. Last month ho
started for Buffalo, N. V.. in order to be
.with his own people during the holidays,
but at Ogden he changed his mind and
came back to San Francisco. He rejoined
the Queen and went on his last voyage on
December 22.
The Australia brought up from Hono
lulu 24 cabin and 79 steerage passengers.
Of the' latter Z6 were convalescent sol
diers. The stout vessel started the new
year well by running into wester at
6 a. m. on the Ist.* By sundown it had in
creased to a gale accompanied by a high
swell and a very rough sea. "It made
things pretty lively." said Chief Officer
Lawless in telling about- the voyage. "At
1:30 a. m on the 2d a tremendous sea
broke aboard in the port waist. It burst
up the hurricane deck, smashed the main
rail, filled the lire room,- bursting the
steam gauges and putting out the lights,
which caused the firemen and coal pass
ers 'to come on deck in a hurry. It Hooded
the saloon and steerage, burst in the win
dow of the main companion way and in
vad.ed some of the staterooms. The gale
soon began to moderate; and yesterday at

William Sullivan, a young- hoodlum liv-

that eloping was not all it is cracked up
to be and their lesson bore fruits. Since
their return the young man made several
flank movements and finally succeeded in
getting "Mamma" Ramon's consent to the
marriage. After leaving the County
Clerk's office the party went directly to
the chambers of Justice Cook, who "tied
the knot.
HAS DROPPED THE CASE.
Attorney General Fitzgerald Moves
to Dismiss thÂ« Suit Against the
Reduction Works.
Attorney General Fitzgerald has filed a
request with the clerk of the Superior
Court to dismiss the proceedings In the
case of the People vs. the Sanitary re
duction Works.
In explanation he says that the attor
neys for the relator neglected to inform
him that tthe question of the highest bid
der has already been determined and the
time in which to make an appeal has
lapsed. This question he considered the
chief one in the case. The remaining
point, the alleged unlawful exercise of the
franchise of the Sanitary Reduction
Works, he is convinced, from the testi
mony taken, is the result of a mere per
sonal and private disagreement between
the individual scavengers and the Reuuc
tion Works.
Proposed Colonial Fair.
The regular monthly meeting of the
trustees of the Mechanics' Institute last
evening was devoted principally to the
possibility of holding the contemplated
Colonial fair next September at the Pa
vilion. President Ernest A. Denicke out
lined the purpose of the undertaking and
declared that it was almost impossible for
the institute to obtain the necessary ex
hibits without aid. He suggested that
the institute combine with the Merchants'
Ase latlon, the Agricultural Association
and other local commercial institutions
for the purpose of conjointly framing
requisition for national aid to be forward
ed to Congress for a liberal appropriation
to further and accomplish the proposed
fair. On motion of one of the trustees a
resolution to place the four or five thou
sand reference books, now kept under
lock and key. Into general circulation was
pro), used and unanimously adopted. The
following members of the institute will
be candidates for membership on the
board of trustees for the coming year, the
election to be held on the 2Sth of next
February: Walter N. Brunt, Ernest A.
Denicke, Lewis C. Huntly, Sheldon G.

Their Protests Heard.
The contest over the election of Daniel
O'Brien by Thomas E. Brophy, the candi
date who was defeated for the Assembly
in the Thirty-lirst Assembly District, was
taken up yesterday afternoon in Justice
Barry's court. The successful candidate
only won by a narrow margin and Brophy
entered a protest on the grounds tnat
gross frauds were perpetrated by design
ing and Incompetent election officers, and
that O'Brien's nomination was made in
an irregular manner. I,eon E. Jones' pro
test over the seating of J. C. Wardell as
Assemblyman from the Thirty-ninth As-
Bembly District was partially heard by
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan. Both mat
ters will be taken up again to-day.
Bill Board Nuisance Checked.
The billboard nuisance, which has re
cently assumed unusual proportions, has
been stopped in its further growth. The
ordinance recently passed by the Board
of Supervisors was signed yesterday by
Mayor Phelan and thus becomes a law.
In * anticipation of this the firms
controlling the boards throughout the city
have commenced to shave them down to
the desired proportions. In addition to
being a menace to life and limb, the
boards were unsightly affairs and detract
ed from the beauty of the city.
To Protect Passengers.
Captains J. K. Bulger and O. F. Bolles,
local inspectors of hulls and boilers, have
issued a circular requiring all steamboat
companies whose vessels are similar in
construction to the T. C. Walker, to em
ploy an extra licensed engineer. In the
ill-fated Walker the engines were in one
part of the boat and the boilers in an
other, while she carried but one engineer.
WESTERN UNION
EXEMPT FROM
THE WAR TAX
Important Decision by
Judge Morrow.
â â â _
ITS PATRONS MUST PAY IT
NO UNSTAMPED MESSAGES MAY
BE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY.
Any Person Filing a Telegram With
out Affixing a Stamp Is Liable
to a Fine of One Hun
dred Dollars.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
filed an opinion yesterday on the demur
rer submitted by the Western Union Tel
egraph Company in the case of J. Waldere
Kirke against that company which prac
tically amounts to a dismissal of the case
and exempts the big corporation from
its share of the war tax.
Kirke some months ago filed an un
stamped telegram in the office of the com
pany. The operators refused to send the
message, and he accordingly brought suit
against the company in the United States
courts. A demurrer was filed in the case
by the telegraph company in which it con
tended that as it would have been subject
to a fine of $10 for receiving an unstamped
message, it was perfectly justified in re
jecting any message which did not bear
a duly canceled stamp.
In his opinion Judge Morrow takes the
same ground as the company and sustains
the demurrer. He cites sections 6, 7, 9 and
18 of the war revenue bill. Section 7 of
this bill Imposes a line of $luo upon any
person who shall make, sign or issue any
taxable paper and neglect to stamp and
cancel the same.
Section 18 of this bill imposes a fine of
$10 upon any telegraph company for send
ing such message in such case. The court
accordingly holds that Kirke should have
stamped his message and is liable in the
som of $100 for filing it, while the com
pany might have been fined $10 had it re
ceived and transmitted it.
The point involved is. Who shall pay
the tax? and the court holds, under the
sections quoted, that the sender must fur
nish the stamp.
A Bellboy Arrested.
Romaine Angel, a bellboy In the Palace
Hotel, was arrested yesterday morning by
Detectives Egan and Gibson and locked
up in "the tanks" at the City Prison.
A number of small articles of Jewelry
have been missing from the rooms of
g\n sts and an opal pin valued at JiO.
which was stolen from the room of A. H.
Wheelhouse, a commercial traveler, in
Octotbcr last, was 1 raced to Angel. It is
not known yet whether he will be prose
cuted. He was a friend of Stephen Hard
ing, the ex-bellboy at the St. Nicholas
Hotel, who was arrested for attempting
to strangle and rob Henry Charles in the
St. Nicholas recently.

JACK RAFFAEL
HAS LEFT HIS
WIFE AND CHILD
The Singer Faithless
to His Vows.
TROUBLE OVER AN ESTATE
HE WAS GIVEN NONE OF HIS
FATHER-IN-LAW'S MONEY.
The Deserted Woman Was the
Daughter of J. Ross Jackson,
Journalist and Bo
hemian.
Jack Raffael, he of the sweet voice and
scarred face, departed unceremoniously
for the East about six weeks ago, leaving
his wife and baby to mourn his loss.
Mrs. Raffael has gone with her child to
her mother's home In Sausalito, where the
saddest part of the sad story will prob
ably happenâ the birth of a little one, who
will never know the protecting love of a
father.
Raffael, whose name stripped of all the
glitter of stage life, is John R. Johnson,
was married three years ago to Carrie
Jackson, only child of the late well-known
newspaper man, J. Ross Jackson. The
marriage from the very start was not a
happy one, and the friends of the Jackson
family did not hesitate to sa-- that the
Tivoli singer had married the heiress for
the sake of the fortune she would eventu
ally inherit. A year after the marriage a
child was born to the mismated couple, a
little boy, that bears the name of a father
and grandfather. J. Ross Jackson Raffael.
Raffael's mistreatment of his wife was
of the refined cruelty sort, in which a con
temptuous neglect played a leading role.
A favorite nnstime of the singer was to
forget all family ties for several days in
erucci ssion, carrying the game to the ex
tent of utter oblivion of home and family.
Ross Jackson left an estate amounting
to about $40,000. and he so arranged it that
the Tivoli favorite had no direct part in
it. Those in a position to know declare
that Raffael's desertion of wife and child
is the direct result of this disposition
made by Ross Jackson of his estate, a dis
position that did not coincide with the
singer's ideas of how a father-in-law's
wealth should be divided.
HAS MILITARY LOCKJAW.
Senator Stewart of Nevada Refuses
to Discuss Anything.
United States Senator William M. Stew
art of Nevada arrived at the Palace yes
terday. The Senator has a very bad case
of military lockjaw, and the only things
he would consent to discuss were his
meals.
When asked what was the status of af
fairs in Congress rr-garding the annexa
tion of the Philippines and his own posi
tion on this present interesting question
he refused to say a word. Being interro
gated as to the significance of his visit to
San Francisco, he replied that he was
here because he wanted to come and be
cause he had a right to come. Regarding
his chances of re-eiection Senator Stew
art refused positively to say a word. He
declared that he was letting the- other
fellows do the talking, and that he had
no statement to make, and that he de
sired to be let alone and given surcease
from notoriety.
St. Rose's School.
St. Rose's School, Brannan street,
opened yesterday with a fair attendance
after being closed since the great fire.
The building was blessed and dedicated
by the pastor, Rev. D. Nugent, with ap
propriate ceremonies and a select choir.
The children and teachers then repaired
to the magnificent church, .where bene
diction of the blessed sacrament was
given, and the religious exercises closed
with the rendering of the "Te Deum."
St. Rose's parish is now fully equipped,
and Father Nugent has one of the finest
churches in the city, a palatial residence
and a school with all modern improve
ments.
The Sloper Divorce Case.
Judge Belcher yesterday made an order
denying Kate E. Sloper a divorce from
her husband, Ira M. Sloper. The court
also refused to entertain the application
on the part of Sloper for divorce from his
wife on his cross-complaint. Mrs. Sloper
was ordered to reconvey her husband cer
tain properties placed in her name prior
to Sloper's departure for Guatemala, an
act which led his wife to instigate suit
for divorce on the ground of desertion,
but which it was proved during the trial
was consented to by Mrs. Sloper.

NERVOUS .DEPRESSIOST
[A TALK WITH MRS. PINKHAM.]
A woman with the blues is a very un-
comfortable person. She is illogical,
unhappy and frequently hysterical.
The condition of the mind known as
" the blues," nearly always, with wo-
men, results from diseased organs of j
generation.
It is a source of wonder that in this, |
age of advanced medical science, any !
person should still believe that mere i
force of will and determination will
overcome depressed spirits and nerv-
ousness in women. These troubles are
indications of disease.
Every woman who doesn't under-
stand her condition should write to
Lynn, Mass., to Mrs. Pinkham for her
advice. Her advice is thorough com-
mon sense, and is the counsel of a
learned woman of great experience.
Read the story of Mrs. P. S. Bennett,
Westphalia, Kansas, as told in the fol-
lowing letter:
" Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I have suf-
fered for over two years with falling,
enlargement and ulceration of the
womb, and this spring, being in such
a weakened condition, caused me to
flow for nearly six months. Some time
ago, urged by friends, I wrote to you
for advice. After using the treatment
which you advised for a short time,
that terrible flow stopped.
"I am now gaining strength and
flesh, and have better health than I
have had for the past ten years. I
wish to say to all distressed, suffer-
ing women, do not suffer longer, when
there is one so kind and willing to
aid you."

pound is a woman's remedy for wo-
man's ills. More than a million wo-
men have been benefited bj r it

An old German woman, living in a Kansas town, says of Ripans Tabulesi
â¢â¢When we came out to Kansas, eighteen years ago, we were very poor and we
had a big family. I had to work very hard in the house and outside, too,
milking cows, slopping hogs, picketing horses, making garden and so on. 2
was far from my relatives and didn't like the country. . I didn't know nobody, ,
so I stayed at home and worried. "We had a hard time of it. No fruit, no
vegetables, no nothing. Such living was enough to ruin anybody's insldes.
After a while my stomach got out of order, and grow worse and worse. I lost
my appetite. Nothing tasted good. I was troubled with sourness and gulp-
Ings. Then I got to be cros3 as a boar. I was downhearted too. I felt kind
of drowsy most of the time, and had no courage for anything. I dreamt the
ewfulaot dreams. Bet I didn't think 7. was' bad sick, and doctors cost too
much and may bo don't do any good. At last, my brother in Philadelphia
Bent me nome Ripans Tabules. He said they were good for my case. I used
feiem and then got more. Soon I was well again, almost like whan Iwu ft
fjri to Germany^ .

C. T. ARNOLD'S
ESTATE HAS
DISAPPEARED
Money and Property
All Gone.
OTHERS CLAIM HIS SALOON.
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR LOOK
ING INTO THE CASE.
Secures Special Letters of Adminis
tration From Judge TrouttâBe
longed to a Wealthy lamily
in Germany.
J. A. Drinkhouse, the new Public Ad
ministrator, took charge of the office
to which he was elected yesterday and
his lirst official act was to instruct At
torney A. Ruef to file an application for
special letters of administration on the
, -t:it.= of C. T. Arnold, who died of pneu
monia Sunday night in a lodging house
at 126 Fifth street. The reason given for
the haste is that the deceased was pos
sessed of considerable' property which
was . sing usurped by parties having no
right to the same. Judge Troutt granted
the application and steps were at once
taken to ascertain the whereabouts of
the decedent's assets.
"/Arnold was until recently the owner of
-.he saloon at 211 Grant avenue. He had
fSOOO in the Humboldt- Savings Bank and
.was possessed of jewelry valued at nearly
JUuhV. including a gold watch and chain,
diamond ring, diamond pin, gold headed
i';ih*> and a diamond studded locket, be
sides land in Santa Clara and Monterey
counties. The saloon is in the possession
of her parties, William Green and
Thomas Conroy, who claim to hold a bill
t>t .sale for the same; the jewelry was
taken by John Hayes, a friend of Arnold;
the money has disappeared completely
nnd nothing finite is yet known con
cerning any title to the real estate he
Is said to have owned.
Arnold, who was about 40 years old,
was a son of a large landowner at Man
helm, Germany, a man said to have been
immensely wealthy and who associated
on terms' of intimacy with the nobility.
Like many another scion of a wealthy
house, young Arnold was extremely wild.
11. was the black sheep of the family.
and because of his escapades in the land
of liis birth he was practically disowned
and sent to America about twelve years
ago. He came direct to San Francisco
and for a number of - years made a
â¢humble living, working in livery- stables
and on ranches, being at one time em
ployed by the late Senator Stanford on
his Palo Alto ranch. Several years ago
he went to Salinas, and is said to have
purchased a valuable ranch in Monterey
County with money sent him by his fa
ther;- He returned to this city in the
early part of last year with his pockets
full of money and purchased a saloon on
Sixth street. Three months ago he dis
posediof the Sixth-street place and pur
chased the saloon at -:1 Grant avenue.
About- December 1 he sold a half interest
in â  tho. place to Thomas Conroy. Green
claims to have bought out Arnold's re
maining Interest a month' ago. but the
hitter's friends say Arnold never gave
them any intimation that ho had sold
(ftu and that the sign of Green & Conroy,
which now appears over the door, was
Hoi put up until Monday, the day after
Arnold's death.

The recital began with Beethoven's
Hotiata, op. 109, and the sonata began
â with the prestissimo, for it was not until
Rosenthal had glided into this division of
it that either he or the late-coming audi
appeared at anything like normal

pathetic emphasis and clear, beautiful
articulation, it was a refined, legitimate
performance, but in no sense wonderful.

\al -was a remarkable performance. At
times It lacked in humorous fancy, but on
the whole it was splendid, full of glitt.r
ing description and tonal Variety and
simply Invincible in the great, glorious
ih of the march. Then followed four
Chopin pieces, ending with Rosenthal'a
famous arrangement of the D flat maior
waltz in thirds, sixths, octavos and what

A familiar piece like this worked up
into such unfamiliar complications and
played lucidly and without effort at

and Mr. Rosenthal played it over again
without taking an extra breath.

the Liszt "Don Juan" fantasy, a work of
Satanic difficulty and one that sounded
Mr. Rosenthal at his best. He made it

of the train crew with Winchesters and

The mail, baggage and express cars

Business Men Back the
State Controller.
ADVICE TO COUNTY OFFICERS
FOOLISH TO BRING SUITS FOR
COMMISSIONS.
Sacramento Chamber of Commerce
Seeking to Have Annulled Con
tracts Designed Simply to
Enrich Attorneys.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3.â The Cham
ber of Commerce of Sacramento is
making a determined effort to have an
nulled in the forty-two counties of the
State interested the contracts entered
into with Devlin & Devlin of Sacra
mento and Rodgers, Paterson & Slack
of San Francisco for the collection of
back commissions which it is asserted
by the attorneys are due the counties
from the State for the collection of
State taxes for a number of years past.
The chamber has appointed a commit
tee which to-day went before the Board
of Supervisors and made an argument
for the annulment of the contract en
tered into with Devlin & Devlin. The
argument followed the line of that
which has been made from time to time
in the editorial columns of The <'nll.
presenting the fact that the counties
would in the end have to bear the bur
den, by increased taxation, of the ex
pense which the State will seemingly
bear in paying the judgments aggre
gating $1,500,000 which the attorneys
hope to secure against the State Con
troller.
The Board of Supervisors took no
definite action upon the request of the
Chamber of Commerce for the rescind
ing of the contract, one member main
taining that it would be impracticable
fur one county to go outalone, inasmuch
as it would only lose in the event that
the other counties obtained judgment
against the State. The Chamber of
Commerce has pledged itself to support
the Controller in the defense of his
suits. The chamber has received the
following letter from the Controller,
copies of which will be sent to all other
mercantile and semi-public bodies in
the State for action similar to that
taken here: , _ â
Controller's Department, State of Cali
fornia, Sacramento, December 28. IKB.
j. O. Coleman, Esq., Secretary,.. f the
Chamber of Commerceâ Dear Sir: In
reply to your favor of yesterday, ask
irg me to give my reasons why the
chums present, d by the various coun
ties against the State for back commis
sions or fees, for collecting the States
portion of taxes, should not be paid, 1
will state that there Js not much to add
to what has already been published in
the daily press.
Prior to M iy, 1893, it was costing the
State between $250,000 and $300,000 an
nually to meet this expenditure, and
was serving no good purpose, 1h â 
money was collected from the counties
In the way of taxes and then returned
to the counties to pay the expense of
. tion. The money did not go to
the county officers, but into the "salary
fund" of "the county treasury, and if
it were necessary for the county to
have this money, it were belter to col
lect it directly by the counties them
selves. In my report of D mber 15,
i called attention to this matter
in the following language:
"The necessity for a repeal of all tho
laws granting Commissions for the as
sessment and collection of State taxes
has been pointed out repeatedly by for
mer Controllers. There is not now a
county in the State in which the offices
of Auditor. Treasurer, 'Pax Collector
and Assessor are not salaried, and all
commissions received by these officers,
with the exception of the Assessors' <">
per cent commission on the collection
of personal property taxes, ere turned
Into the county treasury, and credited
to the salary fund. The present sys
tem is absurdâ it is, in effect, trans
ferring money from one pocket to an
other, and losing a portion in the trans
fer.
"During the early days nf tho State gov
ernment, when county officials were al
lowed the fees received for the perform
ance of official duties tn lieu of a -
salary.it was just and right that the State
should allow commissions for services
red in connection with its revenue;
but that time lias passed, rind such a sys
tem is no longer necessary. Every per
son of ordinary Intelligence can readily
perceive that there is no economy in the
levy and collection of from $300,000 to $500.
--000 additional taxes in order that the State
may return this amount to the various
counties in the form of commissions."
In February. 1893, th* Legislature, fol
lowing out my suggestion, passed the act
abolishing these commissions, and it is
the validity of this law which is now at
tacked by the atorneva rerking to collect
these claims. The claims already present
ed aggregate over Sl.r>oo.ooo. and if the
courts decide tnat they must be pail ti 1
money will have to come from the coun
ties in the shape of an additional tax.
From the best information I can bi
the attorneys will receive about J7
fur collecting trie claims, all of which will
come out of tho pockets of the people
without a single resulting benefit. The
proposition is an utter absurcuty on its
face, and while T do not blamo the attor
neys fur seeking to earn their fees ffor
this is their livelihood). I am inclined to
the belief that no Board Of Supervisors
would have entered into such a contract
had they known what was hack of it.
Very truly, E. P. COLGAN,
Controller.

0 it the necessary revenue stamps. C. M. Cassin, attorney for White, 0

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Dec. 27.â Hawaii sends
Now Year's greetings to California. She
i Is only partially Americanized at present,
and her house somewhat in disorder, but
she lives in hopes of better and brighter
; days and closer friendship with the con
j tinent.
Conversations with men of all shades of
political thought have failed to discover
1 extraordinary interest in the bills framed
for the future government of Hawaii.
They are very much akin to what was
expected from the Commissioners, but it
1 is not expected by many here that they
will pass Congress without considerable
amendment.
The main objections that have been
made by the American element are as
â¢ follows:
Too much appointing power is given to
the Governor of the Territory and not
enough elective officers to the people.
The qualified franchise given by the
bills is unjust and un-American, and
subversive of popular rights.
The "special rights citizens" and deni
zens, the men who did the work of the
successful revolution, are not properly
protected and rewarded.
But the main anxiety is as to who the
first Governor will be. Should Mr. Dole
carry off the prize, it is feared he will
simply reappoint those who at present
surround him, and the disastrous power !
of the "family compact" and "missionary I
Influence" will be retained as at present,
resulting after the first elections In a ;
Legislature opposed to the administra- ;
tion.
Mr. Sewall's friends feel certain that
he is to be tin- happy man, and they boast
that should ho be selected he will make
many changes and install in office the
Americans who aided him in consummat
ing annexation.
The man who would make the most
popular Governor and be almost idolize. i,
ally by the Hawaiians, would be
rai Joseph Nelson Miller; but it is
feared ihat ho will not bo thought of.
We, as a rule, think that President !
McKinley will decide to give us an Ohio â 
man or some political friend with states- I
manlike ability to guide us; but should
he decide to select a Hawaiian citizen he
could find good material in S. M. Damon, i

SHIPWRECKED MEN
PICKED UP AT SEA
THE UNFORTUNATE STEAM SCHOONER PROTECTION.
ASTORIA, Or., Jan. 3.â The British bark
Colgate, Captain Griffith, arrived here to
day, having on board Captain O. Erickson
and fourteen of the shipwrecked crew of
the steam schooner Protection, which
foundered thirty miles off the mouth of
the Columbia River at 4 o'clock on the
morning of January 1.
The Protection left Seattle at 2 o'clock
on Thursday, December 29, with 360 tons
of coal for San Francisco. The weather
was fine until approaching the mouth of
the Columbia, when a heavy southeast
gale sprang up. The Protection was
steaming under Plow bell and the sea was
running very high, washing over the ves
sel fore and aft. On the morning of Sat
urday, December 31, Chief Engineer
Moores reported the vessel leaking and
the pumps were immediately manned.
The water in the vessel's hold was found
to be gaining on the pumps, which were
becoming choked with the slack coal.
The gale Increased in fury and the
steamer rolled and pitched heavily. It
was then determined to jettison the cargo
and about thirty tons was discharged
from the 'tween decks. Finding the water
rapidly gaining, all hands were again or
d< red to the pumps. The men remained
at them all of Saturday night, and to
ward morning five feet of water was dis
covered to be in the hold and the steamer
appeared to be sinking. The v> Bsel was
listing to starboard, and her stern was
seen to be fast going down. Huge waves
continually swept over her forward and
aft. and Captain Ericksnn saw that his
vessel would surely go down.

CRUISER CHITOSE
IS VERY SPEEDY
Trial Run of the Japan
ese Warship.
MEETS ALL REQUIREMENTS
AVERAGES OVER TWENTY-ONE
KNOTS AN HOUR,
Single Test That Now Remains Will
Be Made Just Outside the
Golden Gate in a Few
Days.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Jan. 3.â The pro
tected cruiser Chitose, built by the
Union Iron Works of San Francisco for
the Japanese Government, has success
fully completed the most severe trial
to which she will be subjected before
acceptance. She made a six hours' run
over the co-urse in Santa Barbara Chan
nel to-day, averaging 21.48 knots an
hour, where but 20.5 are required, and
developing a maximum speed of 21.38
under natural draught. This completes
her work in these waters and she will
leave to-night or to-morrow for San
Francisco-. But one test remainsâ a
two hours' run under forced draught, in
which she must average -2.5 knots â and
this will be made outside of the Golden
Gate. This test also has been practi
cally completed, for the cruiser has
averaged 22.867 on two separate occa
sions on a run of over an ho-ur each
time. The contract, however, requires
that the speed must be maintained for
two consecutive hours and the per
formance will be repeated.
The members of the Japanese trial
board express satisfaction with the
Chitose in every particular, and say
that she has been accepted wUh the
one reservation of the forced draft test.
Scientific Expert W. R. Eckart of the
Union Iron Works stated that the data
had not been completely Avorked out
as to horse power and the efficiency of
the propeller, but that the indications
were that with less than 135 revolutions
the ship would make 20.5 knots.
The evolution tests made to-day un
der full speed were successful. The
Chitose turned in a radius of 300 feet,
and stopped from full headway to go
ing astern within her own length. Tho
Japanese naval authorities on board
say that no vessel in the navy excels
the Chltosp.

"WOODLAND, Jan. 3.â The commemora
tion of the emancipation proclamation in
Woodland last evening was an event that
callc-d out the entire colored population.
Large delegations from Sacramento and
elsewhere were present. The festivities
were not concluded until daylight this
morning.
1 the lifeboats were ordered lowered. Sec
ond Assistant Engineer Carvey, while
engaged In the work, was struck by tne
swinging of one of the boats and knocked
overboard and drowned. In the darkness
no assistance could be rendered the un
fortunate man. After much difficulty the
lifeboats were launched and the steamer
abandoned. First Officer Griffin had
charge of one and Captain Erickson com
manded the other. Seven men embarked
in each boat. The boats were supplied
with water, meat and crackers, but the
latter were useless, as they soon became
wet.
The boats were able to keep close to
gether during the day, although the storm

be made toward land. The men suffered
terribly from cold, as they had saved

As the boats pulled away the Protec

still remained afloat during the half hour
before she was lost to view.
Captain Erickson and First Officer Grif

during the night, but the two boats soon
ited after darkness set in and were
lost to view. The < old was intense, and
some of the men in Captain Erickson's
were growing weak. During tho

from the boat, and, being exhausted,
would have drowned had not 'Captain
Erickson saved him. He grasped tho man

Shortly after daylight a sail was sight

BAN JOSE, Jan. 3.â The heirs of the
late Don Luis Arguello, the wealthy
Santa Claran who died on December 5
last, are lighting over their heritage, and
the preliminaries were taken to-day for a
long legal battle. This was In the shape
of a suit brought by Carlos Arguello, a
son, against James S. Arguello, his
brother, to have a deed to the Luis block,
a valuable property on South First street,
near San Fernando, declared a deed of
trust and the property divided equally
between the two. The lana and building
are worth over $50,000.
The plaintiff alleges that on June 6,
1895, his father deeded the property to
James to be hold in trust during testa
tor's life, after which it was orally agreed
and understood James was to deed
hali to his brother. Arguollo senior

carry out thia provision. Therefor
asl s that the property be equally divided
and that I .ant be made b

$20U per month, since December 5.
Luis Arguello, who was the son of the
first Mexican Governor of California,
lived in this county for over sixty 5

and was a hospitable entertainer at his
home at Santa Clara until a few years

Special Dlsrvatcb to The Call.
WASHINGTON; Jan. 3.-The board of
survey appointed by the Secretary of War
to examine into and report on the re
sponsibility for the loss of 300.000 pounds
of refrigerated beef of Swift & Co., which
was rejected by General Miles Upon its
arrival at Ponce. Porto Rico, ami winch
was subsequently thrown overboard while
en route on tie return voyage, rriet to-day
but decided tha; inasmuch as the pro
ceedings of a board of survey were sub
ject to review they would not be made
public.
The boar! is instructed to ascertain if
i proper effort was made to feed this beef'
to the troops at Porto Rjco, and fix the
â  respond Uity in case proper effort was
not made to ascertain whether, as â¢ re-
S ported in the testimony: before the war
! commission, the beef had been chemically
treated, and whether the United State's
was r-sponsible for its loss, which in-
VOlves a rciMmmendation as to whether
Swift & Co. should be reimbursed. ,v
boari of survey has no power to admrn
fean only find on information and
mmend, subject to review o-f the ap
ting officer, in this case Secretary of-
Alger. They intimate that the pre-
ings are not of great importance, in
reality only involving a recommendation
as to whether Swift & Co. should be paid
fur the beef. Such a recommendation
however, necessarily' involves the nxinir
of the responsibility for the rejection of
the beef. . â  .
The board decided to go into the Investi
gation exhaustively. All the records will
be carefully examined, witnesses will be
summoned and. wherever possible, affi
davits will be obtained- in support of testi
mony. The board has n<> power to ad
minister . oaths, and affidavits therefore
must be. voluntary. Representatives of
the Swift company undoubtedly will be

'â¢.'., "lt; is always customary on this oc
c'asicm for the Mayor to make recom
mendations for such action by the
Supervisors as he deems necessary for
the public welfare and I take pleasure
in following that custom at this time."
"With these words of introduction
Mayor Phelan presented his message to
the new Board of Supervisors yester
day. ; His Honor did not trust the read-
Ving to' the clerk, preferring to empha
; pise the salient suggestions he had to
. otter instead of having them lost in a
Frog-song delivery. The most import
ant feature of the message is a recom
mendation that the park panhandle be
extended to Market street, thereby
creating a beautiful boulevard from
the heart of the city to the ocean. Gas
and water rates were criticized and the
Supervisors : were reminded of their
pledge to keep within the $1 limit.
Taxes and the conditions of our streets
were' referred to and remedies for ex
. isting evils suggested. A digest of the
message follows:
. To the Honorable the Board of Supervisorsâ
. IJ^ntlemen:
â¢-., The- most important event of the past year
â¢ was: the adoption of the Freeholders' Charter
â¢for the city and county of San Francisco,
â which was the fifth one submitted to the voters
' *inee ISM) and the first one that met with their
, approval. It is now in the hands of the Legls
â¢ Jauire for ratification, concerning which there
'la no reasonable doubt. When ratified it goes
â¢ into effect for all substantial purposes on the
l^t of January, 1900; but this administration
. will be in power only until that time and will
,tc" superseded by officers elected in November
;. of this year. It is our duty to make the best
' use- of our opportunities of the new order of
thi-nps. .
1 wouM recommend In this connection that
Ifche legislature be petitioned to resubmit to
â¢ the" people Assembly Constitutional Amend
ment No. 37, giving complete local control over
Ideal affairs to the city ana county of San
l'rancisco under its charter.
.- Water Rates.
One of the first duties is to fix the rates for
water as quired by law. As preliminary to
lixing rates the lard should require a detailed
â¢' 'rtatement of the receipts and expenditures of
â¢ tire water company, not such as they ordinarily
' submit; but- one particularizing the salaries
aad every outlay, with a view of determining
whether there is any extravagance in the man
cement of the water company. The law re
'qujrrs that you allow the company its taxes, J
H> ' operating expenses and a reasonable in-
Merest, upon Its stotk nd bonds. You should
. not al!"'i\v oieratin^ expenses without a full
â knowledge of them, nor should you allow in
â¢ terest up^n. stotk and bonds if you believe the
i?sue of "such stock and bonds unnecessary for
â¢the BuppLy;of the city and county with water.
iniring the year "tho ring Valley Water Com
pany lias, placed a third mortgage upon its
â¢property of je.O'Xi.O- 1 . and under this mortgage
. has issued bonds aggregating 100. 000 to date,
.presumably for. permanent improvements. The
platforms of all the political parties repre-
s ented in this board have pledged you to fix
â¢ a water rate which will net the company not
rr.'jre than 5 per cent on its capital stock.
Millions for Light.
The' tract for lighting public buildings
â¢has been let for two years from June 3, 189S,
".to tha ?an Francisco Gas and Electric Com
' i any and the Pacific Gas Improvement Com
â¢â "riny, which pools its earnings with the former
. '<' reparation, at the following rates: For gas
â¢ â â¢ f";7-can.ile power), $1 50 per 1000 cubic feet, and
. fr.r electric light (16-candle power), for certain
â  ViMlldlnEs 10 cents' per 1000 Watt hours, and
: 'f.r certain other buildings, 15 cents per 1000
â¢ IrtVatt =houre. It Is necessary to keep a check
"â¢'â¢tipon the infters, because during the year, by
'. expert*, I discovered that the electric meters of
'â¢ t.hÂ» City Hall were running about Â£0 per cent
â¢ faÂ«t and secured a. corresponding rebate from
'.â¢tfce- tv.mpany. The cost of lighting the public
.' buildings .luring the last fiscal year amount
â¢ti $4Â° 7>l S7 This contract should have been
'.-.let for but one year, and the board may set It
-aside <in'i rÂ»advÂ»rtise for proposals.
.â .'.The most Important contract, nojreyer,
". wh'ch involves an expenditure of about J300,000
- pir annum, is the lighting of the streets and
.'."iÃuiurbs by gas and electric light. The Super
: Visors undertook to let a contract for this pur
.... pose to the Pan Francisco Gas and Electric
â â¢.Company for two years from the 15th day of
â  -August 1898, at the following rates: For each
â frar lamp, not to exceed 4800 In number. 11
. -htarx per nleht: for each electric lamp (2000
--candle power), 50 cents per night.
, The Mayor then gives the details of the
â¢ attempt by the Mutual Electric
; i;icht Company to establish a competing
planf and furnish light to the city at a
saving of $40,000 of public money yearly.
' The Supervisors blocked the project and
'.the rase was taken into court. Judge
Beawell decided the action of the Super
-visors was illegal. Following the deci
sion his Honor vetoed the lighting con
tract. >>ut he was overruled by the boarn,
and subsequently he vetoed the demands
' of the gas company for payment of their
' bills. Continuing, he says:
As advised by the City and County Attorney,
the board I aa full power to regulate the rates
â¢for gas and electric light for private consump
tion. Thfl Mutual Electric Light Company claim
that they would have saved not only the city
i J40.000 on its contract, but private consumers
1100.000 if their petition <â ' the 10th day of
â  April were granted, which will clearly Indicate
to you that the price* charged for artificial light
in th] olty are excessive. The Pan Francisco
' Gas an 1 KWtrlc Company's plant. I am
' credibly infnrmed. can be duplicated for not
more than ti. 000,000, whereas it is selling on
â  the market for upwards of 112,000,000, and the
â  liners are paying inia company Interest at
'.the rate of 6 per cent on the par value of
its s=tf*-k and bonds, now standing at upward
of 113.090.500, besides Its taxes operating ex
. penses and surplus accumulations.
; The rank inflation of this stock is notorious.
As the consumer Is required to pay on this
fictitious capitalization, the consumer Is being
robbed with am! by the tent of the Board
of Supervisors. It is the principal duty of the
Gas inspector under the law to make an in
vestigation of these facts as preliminary to
. fixing a reasonable rate, but this the Gas In-
FpÂ»ctor has failed to do.
The Mayor then declared that munici
pal ownership is the only ultimate solu
'â¢ tion of the vexatious gas and water ques
. tion.
: He believes the cemeteries areencroach
â¢ Jnj? upon the health and progress of the
city nnd that further interments in the
city limits should be prevented and he
. recommends a liberal policy toward the
â¢suburbs in the construction of sewers and
. the Improvement of the sanitary condi
â¢â¢â  tions. The extension of the Sunset dis
trict sewer system from Fourteenth and
li streets to Twenty-fourth and I streets
.'is recommended, the property-owners
having agreed to share In the expense.
Regarding Schools.
.The only control the board exercises over
r .the public schoolÃ is 'i the making of the
i appropriation for their support. With the co
operation of the Auditor, however, a segrega
tion of funds may be forced under section 4
. of the act of March 20, lSf!S(Worl"y' B ConVoMda
tion Act. p. 110). the Auditor refusing to audit
. a-ny demands contrary to such segregation Th
.-object of this plan would be to protect th
teachers in their salaries for the full twelve
months and to limit the expenditure of other
-.moneys according to the one-twelfth act to
twelfth of sWh segregated items. I made
this .recommendation to the former Auditor
.. and * now I renew it to the present Auditor*
â¢ The estimated deficit in the school fund due
to the criminal extravagance of the School
.Board, Is $237,000.
rs The placing underground of all over
i head wires In certain districts within tix
months is also recommended.
About Franchises.
Under the State law franchises for street
railway! and tor other purposes may be granted
to the high bidder offering the largest per
centage of the gross receipts, and as prelim
inary to such bidding the board may specify
reasonable conditions as to paving between the
tracks, and the free carriage of postmen,
policemen firemen and other municipal em
ployes, while in the discharge of their duty.
1 would warn the board against granting any
franchise from this county into San Mateo
County, because i:' that is done, in the case,
for instance, of the Market-street Railway
Company, a privilege which they contemplate
seeking, the jurisdiction of the Assessor of the
city and county of San Francisco over the as
sessment of such railway property would pass
to the State Board of Equalization, which to
day presumes to assess the property of the San
Francisco and San Mateo Railway Company.
Surety Bonds.
On account of the confusion of the city
government resulting from the decision of the
Supreme v>.urt in the case of Kahn vs. Sutro,
there is a grave question whether official bonds
for county officers can be given by surety
companies, and the Legislature should be called
upon to remedy this defect. in view of the
early ratification of the charter and In view
of the great responsibility of both the Treas
urer and the Auditor, their bonds should be
doubled. 1 recommend to the Board of Super
visors to increase the bonds of these officers,
the city to pay the additional premium charged
b~ the surety companies.
The administration of the Health Depart
ment should be supported by the Board of
Supervisors. The public health Is the first con
cern of every well regulated municipality.
The Board of Health is endeavoring to
stamp out the traffic in adulterated foods, and
this work merits encouragement.
City Adornment.
At the request of the San Francisco Art
Association, I have appointed a committee to
draft a comprehensive plan for the adornment
of San Francisco, as follows: Messrs Arthur
Rodgers. J. B. Reinstein, F. "W. Dohrmann F
W. Zelle. Bruce Porter, Albert Pissis. John A.
Stanton. Douglas Til.len and Irving M Scott.
Recently Mrs. Phebe Hearst announced
her intention to offer prizes under a competi
tive plan, such as she has successfully done in
the case of the University of California, to the
architects of the world for the artistic im
provement of San Francisco. This is a note
worthy event in the history of the city and is
preliminary to the Inauguration of the new
charter, wherein machinery is provided for
carrying out such work as she proposes. Such
purposes will, I trust, early find their realiza
tion.
The Board of Supervisors have referred the
project for the conversion of the House of Cor
rection property into a public park to this
committee. This plan involves abolishing the
Branch County Jails 2 and 3, and confining
petty offenders now Incarcerated there to the
vaults in the basement of the City Hall, which
Is practicable and perhaps desirable.
Free Library Building.
A free library building is among the press
ing needs from the point of view of beauty
and utility. The present quarters in the City
Hall are inadequate and the city spends more
than 1,000 a year out of the tax levy for its
support. The same appropriation would main
tain It in better quarters. The location of the
library has not got much to do with its general
use and the school lots at the corner of Fifth
and Market streets, now under lease, might
properly be used for this purpose. The people
will not give up any of their squares. A fire
proof building on this site, the upper floors
approached by broad stairways and elevators,
to be used for library purposes, might still
be made to produce revenue, as now, from
stores, for the school fund.
Park Panhandle.
But perhaps one of the most necessary Im
provements which the city demands Is a proper
approach to Golden Gate Park. I have ex
amined and found no obstacle In the way of
extending the panhandle- to Market street.
From Baker street to the corner of Van Ness
avenue and Market street there are thirteen
blocks, bounded by Fell and Oak streets. If
this land were acquired and converted Into a
park by the planting of trees and the macad
amizing of roads similar to the Panhandle
these beneficial results would accrue: A park
would be made in the heart of the cfty, ac
cessible to the people without the payment of
carfare. It would be equally accessible to the
Mission by way of Valencia street, parts of the
Western Addition, Pacific Heights and North
Beach by way of Van Ness avenue. Itself a
boulevard, and the business and hotel section,
south side and Potrero by way of Market
street, which will, during the year under a
contract already let, be paved with bituminous
rock to Van Ness avenue. It will give a
straight and delightful drive, protected from
heavy traffic and preferably under the juris
diction of the Park Commissioners, to the peo
ple of this city. The grade is not greater than
any grade which any of the streets now lead
ing to the park encounter, and by a winding
road to the summit, embracing, if necessary
two blocks at thnt point, even that grade can
be measurably overcome.
I have taken from the Assessor's books the
valuation put upon these thirteen blocks by
him. and find it to be M follows: For land
$901. Improvements, $871,960; or a total of
51, 572.220. From these figures it would be safe
to say that the real value is not more
than from two to two and one-half million
dollars, ana a deduction would have to be
made from this for improvements, which can
be taken or or sold. If the Panhadle were
extended through these blocks the immediate
consequent would be a filling up of all the
vacant property in the neighborhood and fur
ther west with the dwellings now resting upon
the land, and which might be moved thither,
and forcing the population to build up our
suburbs, something, which Is In itself desirable.
The Mayor suggests that money for
this project could be raised by issuing 3
per cent 20 or 40 year bonds, and he rec
ommends that the subject be submitted
to the, people for rejection or approval

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1899.
MAYOR JAMES D. PHELAN.
â  for which you were not responsible; salaries
J for extra police, $30,600; judgments, interest
' and sinking fund, approximating $75, 00,. 1 es
-1 tlmate, therefore, that the board can keep its
pli dge and raise the total of these amounts,
|5,370,115. As the revenue for the current fiscal
â  year for city purposes was $6,089,806 72, a re
-1 trenchment for the next fiscal year of $719. 7.1 Is
â  necessary.
The facts are that the property of the small
illy assessed, while the prop
erty of the quasi-public corporations, princi
pally, is grossly undervalued. In a com
munication to the Board of Sup< rviaors on July
14, last year, I showed that seven street rail
way and lighting corporations in this city were
under assessed $32,721,15U>. That represented the
difference between the selling price of their
stock and bonds In the market and the total
valuation of their tangible property as assess
ed. This is due to the failure of the Assessor
to properly assess the franchises of these cor
porations, which should be valued according
I to the rule upheld by the Supreme Court in
case of San Jose Gas Company vs. January.
As just stated the Assessor and this Board
of Supervisors are pledged by their party plat
forms to this rule, which will largely increase
the assessment roll and thÂ» city's resources.
But thpre are other circumstances affecting the
revenue of the city, to which I desire to call
your attention, namely, the conversion of State
banks into national banks. The Nevada,
Sather and Tallant banks have recently been
nationalised, and under a decision of the Su
preme Court, and exempt from taxation. These
â  rties were assessed in IS>'j7 J1, ni1, 621, and
also paid license tax In addition to ordinary
city and county and State taxes. The loss to
the city from this source alone is $20,523 this
year.
The Regents of the University, by Investing
State funds in the city, which are not assess
able, have diminished our revenues from taxa
tion in approximately the same amount.
Whereas we cannot easily remedy this, as far
as the university is concerned, although it
would be more equitable for the State to ap
propriate the amount of local taxation lost to
the localities by investment of university funds
and bequest* ; still, in the matter of national
banks' exemption, the remedy is plain. Either
rnia must amend Its constitution or Con
gress amend the national bank act to remedy
these defects. The latter course would prob
ably be the speedier, and I recommend the
Board of Supervisors to memorialize Congress
on this subject.
De\A/ey Boulevard.
On February 18, 197. I appointed a citizens'
committee to relieve the distress among the
unemployed, of which William M. Bunker acted
as chairman. The result was the construction
of Balboa, afterward named Dewey, boulevard.
The late Adolpta Sutro and the Spring Valley
Water Company generously gave deeds through
their lands. The deed of Sutro Is now in es
crow with I. W. Hellman, president of the
Nevada Bank, to be delivered on condition that
the boulevard Is completed within five years
from March 22, ISS7, from Seventh avenue and
N street to the Junction of the Corbett. and
Trocadero roads. I recommend that these con
ditions be complied with at the earliest pos
sible date.
Streets and Paving.
During the last fiscal year the city has ac
cepted 13Va mileÃ of paved streets, making a
total of nearly 177 miles of accepted paved
streets in this city which must be liept in re
pair at public expense. Over 14 milee of the
new streets were paved with bituminous rock
under exclusive specifications. I recommend
that the specifications be broadened to include
asphalt and wooden blocks, the pavements
that are most favored in Eastern cities, and
both of which are California products. There
has been let for two years, expiring June ?A
1900, a contract for keeping all accepted streets
in repair to the City Street Improvement Com
pany for the aggregate sum, to be paid in
monthly Installments, of $37,797. The city now
exacts a guarantee of five years from con
tractors for the pavement of accepted streets,
but the system Is loose and unsatisfactory. In
other cities a guarantee as high as fifteen years
is exacted and surety bonds given for faithful
performance. I will lay before your Street
Committee a plan embodying theso reforms.
On Folsom, Kearny and other streets It will
be observed that the new pavement wears In
grooves by reason of the practice of teamsters
to use one of the railroad tracks. This can
be obviated, in a measure, by requiring the
street car companies to lay tracks, which Is a
legitimate municipal regulation, flush with the
street.
The Supervisors are urged to apply
drastic measures to compel the removal
of all unused tracks and cable slots and
if the companies refuse to obey the order
to have the nuisances* removed by the
Superintendent of Streets. The board is
asked to give Immediate attention to the
repaying of streets in the business sec
tion.
Vlce-RJdden Streets.
During the year St. Marys, Quincy and
i Berry streets have been closed acalnst lm
j moral traffic, on account of their proximity to
I houses of worship, schools, hotels and theaters,
j whither people, young and old, are compelled
to go. They Bhould be kept closed.
Garbage Contract.
The Sanitary Reduction Works have a fran
chise for fifty years from the city, giving them
a monopoly of the incinerating of garbage.
When this privilege was granted it was under-
I stood that it would yield revenue to the city,
and that the charge to householders would
not be increased, and the managers assured
me that If it were necessary to protect the
householders they would remove the garbage
themselves. However, a charge is made of 25
cents a cubic yard by the company from the
j scavengers for the destruction of garbage, and
i this Is added to the householders' bills. The
j scavengers objected to the method of measur
i Ing, which was made by emptying the con
i tents of the wagons into boxes of a cubic yard
! capacity, and the complaint was that a wagon
! when filled and packed containing three cubic
| yards would thus measure five and more cubio
! yards. As a result a conflict arose between
i the scavengers and the Reduction Works.
The legality of the franchise was questioned.
! and the right of the company to compel the
' delivery of garbage to their works to be de
-1 stroyed by them exclusively was questioned,
and the whole matter is now in the courts to
determine ihe rights of the parties In the prem
ises. As the scavengers now collect the in-
I creased rate for the removal of garbage, and
the company collects Its rate for its Incinera
tion, as authorized by Its franchise, awaiting
the decision of the court I have no specific
recommendation to make at thin time. Dur
ing the year an attempt was made to have the
city enter Into a contract, after Inviting bids
for the removal of garbage within a large, yet
limited district, at the public expense. Al
though the money was appropriated the board
yielded to the general opposition to the plan
and refused to Invite proposals. The cost of
this would aggregate at leaat $300,000 annually,
and It is a question whether It is a proper mu
nicipal function. As It stand*, which haa been
the custom here from thn beginning, people pay
In proportion to the dirt they make, which is
not illogical.
C!ty Buildings.
On the 81st of December the City HaU Com-v,
missloners transferred the completed City Hall
to the municipality, after more than twenty
five years have b en consumed in its construc
tion. This is a matter for congratulation, al
though, on arc-mint of the limited funds, the
building can hardly be Baid to be a completed
structure.
The criminal departments nnw housed In this
bull. linn: will be removed probably by the Ist
of August to the new Hall of Justii
Important transfer will occur durinÃ this ad
ministration 1 have vetoed the contract to fur
nish the new building-, in order, among other
reasons, to give this board an opportunity to
carefully provide for such transfer and I
cide which officers shall leave tins building,
and to what use such vacated offices shall be
put.
I have brought an action to demonstrate
what I believe to be the true Interpretation of
the law. that the County clerk li
thirty-two deputies, whereas ho has employed
eiehty-f.-.ur. The appropriation made only
contemplates the employment of thirty-two
ami hence, unless we get an early decision of
the court, there will be a large deficit again
In this office.
IPrlmt Proceedings.
In every well regulated municipality the
minutes of I ra are taken
down and printed and a copy furnished each
member several days before the session. Iâ â¢
this means corrections '-an bo nr
Supervisors and the public kept well Inl
of the board's deliberations. Am it la n iw, the
minutes are read but n..t heard, and so import
ant a matter as this public record is allowed
to pass without correction or verification. It
would, in hands less worthy than our clerk,
be subject to great abuse. I recommend that
the minutes be printed.
Exposition Committee
Obedient to a popular demand, I have ap
pointed a committee to prepare a plan for an
exposition In Han Fran ably to Illus
trate the resources of the Pacific Ocean and
countries tributary to this city and State. The
committee consists of Messrs. J, H. Reinstein
Charles Bundschu, John H. Grady, A S Bald
win, R. H. Warfleld, A. A. Watkins, W, H.
Mills, A. B. SpreckelÃ, Irving- M. Scott Dr. T
11. Morris, F. T,. Brown, S. 11. Friedlander, C.
A. Clinton. John Lackmann and R. P. Doolan.
Aw a result of the war with Spain. San Fran
seems to be a direct beneficiary. The
acquisition of the Hawaiian and Philippine
Islands has given us hii interest in the coun
tries to our west which we never appreciated
before. San Francisco looks out Upon 0
with expectant eyes, and perhaps it is pi
to focalize the interest of the world in our Kre:u
future -as the chief port of the I'nited States on
the Pacific by holding such an exposition, and
I trust that when it takes definite form the
board will give it encouragement and support.
Respectfully submitted,
JAMES D. PITELAN. Mayor.
NEW ADMINISTRATION
NOW IN FULL CHARGE
Supervisors Formally Organize
and Make Many Appoint
ments.
At 2:30 o clock yesterday afternoon the
retiring and Incoming Boards of Super
visors filed into the board chambers and
tho formal ceremony of dissolving the
one and organizing the other was quickly
disposed of. Politicans of all shades and
degrees of prominence and hundreds of
would-be office-holders tilled the galiery
and the space behind the rail in the rear
of the room. Individuals about to be ap
pointed to lucrative positions by tho new
administration wore also there in force.
Many of them appeared somewhat ap
prehensive that the slate arranged by the
bosses might at the last moment be shat
tered and they would be cast aside for
some one with greater influence.
Dr. Sussdorff, superintendent of the
City and County Hospital, came to ascer
tain if any changes were to be made in
his domain. Ex-Police Judges Low and
Joachimsen were there to learn in which
department of the Police Court the;
to act as prosecutors; their Honors Police
Judges Mogan and Graham, Justice of the
Peace Dunne, ex-Auditor Broderick, Who
is happy to be divorced from office, and
many other well-known men about the
City Hall stood along the side wall during
the session.
Mayor Phelan called the meeting to
order. Dodge and Sheehan were the only
members of the old board who failed to
attend the last meeting. As soon as the
rollcall was completed and tho minutes
were read Britt moved that the rules be
suspended and the new board be inducted
into office. The motion carried, of course,
without objection, and Devany of tho
First Ward arose and presented his suc
cessor, Edward Holland. The other mem
bers followed suit. Introducing their suc
cessors with a few congratulatory and
complimentary remarks.
When the introductions were finished

NO FAITH CURE.
ABOUT STUART'S DYSPEPSIA
TABLETS.
They Cure Stomach Troubles and In-
digestion Anyway, Whether
You Have Faith in
Them or Not.
Mere faith will not digest your food
for you, will not give you an appetite
will not increase your flesh and
strengthen your nerves and heart, but
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will do these
things, because they are composed of
the elements of digestion, they contain
I the juices, acids and peptones necessary
to the digestion and assimilation of all
wholesome food.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest
food if placed in a jar or bottle in water
heated to 98 degrees, and they will do
it much more effectively when taken
into the stomach after meals, whether
you have faith that they will or not.
They invigorate the stomach, make
pure blood and strong nerves, in the
only way that nature can do it, and
that is, from plenty of wholesome food
well digested. It is not what we eat,
but what we digest that does us good.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by nearly all druggists at 50 cents for
full sized package, or by mail from
the F. A. Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich.
Munyon'sHeadache and Indigestion Cure
Is the only remedy on the market that
will cure every form of Headache in 3
to 10 minutes, correct Indigestion, stim-
ulate the nerves and build up the sys-

THE LUMBER YRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron, under date of
January 1, Fays: "The lumber trade is the
first to be affected by any untoward circum-
Btances' and the continued apprehension that
â  the State is to be afflicted witn another dry
year causes lumbermen to almost despair. The
. local trade- is almost at a standstill with no
prospect of an Increase. Should rain come
In goodly quantity during January there would
be an instantaneous revival and the mill
â wheels would rapidly revolve. Reports from
â¢:' all over the State show an alarming dullness,
but December is always a dull month. The
'â  arrivals from Pujfet Sound ports have been
'" normal and the foreign demand for fir, spruce
and redwood has kept up. Eastern lumber
â  ' ' dealers are making inquiry for redwood, and
' the new year opens with better prospects than
n - evor for redwood shingles, which are fast mak
.'â¢;.. ing their way into the Easi. Eventually the
'â ' mill men of Mendoclno, Humboldt and Del
â ';â¢' TCorte counties will find great profit in shingles.
â .. The mountain mills are about all closed down
â .-and reports say that sugar pine mills have
â¢. all done well this season.
.â¢.:= "The hardwood situation is about as it has
â¢.' been since the middle of the year and there
' : â¢; -Is every promise of a strong revival, to occur
'.- "in the next few months. The latter months of

â¢â â¢' â¢ but business usually picks up and becomes
â .y : 'prosperous by May and June If not before.
.;'â¢â¢. "Throughout the Eastern market, quiet is the
â¢' â¢ best term applicable, but such is always the
;â ;';. case In December. The year has been very
â¢'â¢"good to almost all the localities, but with
â¢" -perhaps too small a marginal profit even with
;.. ; .the large sales reported. Everything points
.".â¢toward a readjustment of relations between
â¢â ;-. returns and demands. Taken in consideration.

,'â¢' lent, should be the banner one and a brilliant
; "-. closing to the nineteenth century."
-f'\': : THE RAIN.
â .'â¢"â¢: .. The recent storm was general throughout the
- * .State. The fall ranged from half an inch to
'â¢'...' an inch in the San Joaquin, from one to two
"â¢ â¢ Inches In the Sacramento Valley, and from
. ' two to two and a half inches along the north
.;. em coast tier of counties. At San Luis
â â . Oblspo, nearly two and a half Inches fell.
t --Heavy snow fell in the mountains. It was a
...= fine New. Year's gift to the State, and the
;'â¢â â¢'. effect is already apparent in increased con
. ifidence and a renewed disposition on the part
â â¢ of everybody to go ahead and do something.
THE HOP TRADE.
A local circular says of the hop trade In
ISDS:
"The Pacifies Coast produced for the season
â¢ of 1898 a crop of about 143,000 bales of hops,
â  'about 6 per cent less than in 1897. From out
.;. of such there remain only about. 12,500 bales
â  . In growers' hands, the bulk of which consists
. '. of mediums. In addition to the above there is
the usual amount of IS9S stock in the posses
.;. . sion of dealers, most of which is held on ac
\. 'count of sales for future deliveries. The mar
â ;'. ket was a very quick one, at prices ranging
all the way from 10c to 13c per pound, accord
ing to quality and district. This season Oregon
'.produced more hops and of average better
quality compared with California and Washing
." â¢ ton, although Sonoma County turned out some
,;: .beautiful goods, some of which commanded as
. ;â : high as l&c, which represents the highest price
â¢â¢â¢. paid so far on the coast. Of the 20,000 bales
:. â¢â  : of hops which were on hand on July 1 ISSS
. ; remain only about Woo bales, ranging "in
: **-' 0 from 1593 to 1597. and in the hands of a
.â¢ â¢ few dealers. The statistical position of the
..; market is certainly a strong one, as we have â¢
: great many less hops in sight at this time of
â¢ the year than we have had for many a season
while the sales of malt liquors in the United
'"â ' n^rrJÂ°L the , fiscal year shows an increase of
:â  â¢ S.OOtt.flOO barrels. We hear that some dealers
. are already looking around for the 1899 crop
which wiii not be ready rore next fall, and
the price offeredâ about 10câ has not led to any
1 business as yet. On account of paying prices
â  during the past couple of seasons there is some
...disposition to increase the acreage and which
does not look like a safe proposition, as the
..- worlds present acreage, with any sort of de
â¢ cent crop, will result in an over-production
..-with accompanying low prices."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NSW YORK, Jan. 3.â The market was Irreg
ular to-day, but left off strong: with fractional
gains in most shares with larger gains in othei
stocks where interest largely centered. Initial
prices were generally higher, but subsequent
speculation was somewhat reactory and Lon
don sold some 30.000 shares, partly on the
Philippine incident and renewed talk of trouble
between France and England. Profit-taking
sales caused some of the railways to recede
from the early best figures, Xew York Central
being especially weak, although it subsequently
recovered most of Its loss. American Steel and
Wire shares after opening with Improvements
were raided and the common declined 5 points
and the preferred lost IS and then rallied 3%
and 12 points, respectively. In the afternoon
rise there was an increase in the volume of
trading. The favorable November statement
of Louisville started an upward movement in
that stock of Â» and a better tone spread to the
rest of the list. Western Union and Kansas
and Texas preferred also displayed strength.
Improvement in the anthracite trade because of
the cold weather was assigned a reason for the
rise in these stocks, although the advance
in the price of coal predicted for the begin
ning of the year failed to materialize. The in
crease in eastbound shipment and the reported
restoration of trunk line freight rates were sup
porting factors in the stock concerned. Ameri
can Sugar was hammered from time to time
on the unsettled conditions of the trade and
lost 2 per cent.
Railway bond prices forged upward to-day
on heavy purchases. Total sales. $6,101,000.
United States fours declined % and the old
fours coupon advanced % in the bid price.'

and aggregate transactions were hardly in

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 3.â Wheat at the opening
and for a few moments following showed com
parative firmness, though not so much as had
been expected from the strong curb markets
prevailing since Friday. Opening unchanged
at 71%@71%c, a very moderate buying demAnd,
most of which came from the outside, sufficed
to advance the price to 72% c. That was the
turning point. Liverpool was only *4d higher.
Paris was reported 55 centimes lower. Argen
tine crop reports were favorable, although the
advices were to the effect the harvest would be
late. There was nothing oppressively bearish
In the news, but shortly after the opening it
became evident that most of the heavy bull
traders were convinced that a reaction was
due and that the ruling prices Justified profit
j taking. There was also the selling of wheat
I by the class of speculators who invariably put
i out short lines utter January 1. Bull news
I was plentiful later in the session, but in the
meantime the selling movement had- become
general, professional short sellers adding not
a little to the weakness the market developed
by pounding it vigorously. Before noon a very
; material decline had taken place. May reached
70% c shortly after noon. The weakness that J
j developed In corn was given a good deal of ]
attention by wheat traders, and affected prices ;
more or less. Expectations in regard to the
visible decrease were realized, the figures
showing a decrease of 1,890,000 bushels. This
steadied the market. Near the close May
rallied to 70%(570 ; >4c and closed at that price.
Corn was active and weak. Cables were i
weak and lower and receipts were large. The i
feature was the closing out of a large line
' of long corn, showing good profits, and caused
! a sharp break in prices. May closed at %@lc
| lower.
The market for oats reflected corn In every
; particular. There was heavy liquidation and
the market was weak from the start. May
lost %<2\c.
Provisions late In the day showed a good
deal of firmness. The market finally broke
in sympathy with wheat and corn, but toward
the close support again developed and part of
i the decline was recovered. At the close May !
pork was about 10c lower, lard 5c lower and
ribs 7%c lower.

TROOPS SAIL
FOR ILOILO
It May Fall to the Boys to
Chastise the Rebellious
Filipinos.
Washington Government Strives
to Keep the Peace While Gen
eral Otis Prepares for War.
MANILA. Jan. 3. â Advices from Iloilo were received to
day by the steamship Bolinoa, which left thereon Sunday. At the
time of the departure of the. Bolinoa the insurgents still held con
â  if the city, and no American troops had been landed.
The First California Regiment embarked
here at 4 o'clock to-day on the steamships
Campania and Maritime, to report to Gener
al Miller at Iloilo. The steamships were
convoyed by the gunboat Concord.
Though it has not been officially announced, it is supposed
the extension of the American occupation will now be system
atically begun in the southern islands. General Rios, the Spanish
rnor of the Yiscayas. arrived here yesterday from Zam
â¢ anga, on the island of. Mindanao, where he took the Spanish
troops when he evacuated Iloilo. He visited General Otis to
lay. Rios denies the imputation of collusion with the insur-
5 3 saving he ga^ c up only when ordered to do so by the Gov
ment at Madrid.
Aguinaldo is evidently organizing his following to oppose
the Americans. V ,-terday he hastily summoned the Filipino
Cabinet and Congi .>ss to assemble.
The British <: mboat Rattler left to-day for Iloilo and Cebu
irotect English interests at those places.
WASHINGTON, Jan.S â General Otis,
commanding at Manila, has cabled the
War Department that, in his opinion,
General Miller has the situation well in
. â¢ hand at Hollo, and that he fully under
stands the purpose of the President not
to crowd the insurgents unduly. It is
4 highly desirable that a hostile Collision
â¢ between the American forces' and- the
insurgents be avoided at all hazards; at ,
ieast pending Che ratification-- of the
â¢Paris treaty, and as Genera] Miller un- I
â  demands now this purpose on the part f
' of the President, he will be guided by J
It and may be relied upon to resort to j
force only under absolute compulsion.
.The officials here are now fully satis
fied that the trouble at Iloilo may: be ;
traced- directly back to the Spanish
:'-. colonel who was the. senior Spa.nish, I
â unry" officer in' the Philippine- group,
. and. recently in. command of the â Vis
aya group, including the island, of- Pa-:
.nay and the city and garrison of Iloilo.
Ceneral Otis' reports show that, though
;; besieged with his SO) soldiers in Iloilo
.. by a superior force, the position of the
Spanish was thoroughly tenable. They
.had repulsed every attack of the in
surgents and had inflicted great, loss i
upon the latter, and altogether there ;
was no reason why they should not
have held out Indefinitely. This was .
.: practically the case in view . of the
knowledge of the Spaniards, that,- by i
the terms of the treaty, the United ;
â  States Government has undertaken to
' carry them back to Spain, involving, of :
course, their release from the siege at ,
â¢ the earliest possible moment.
It is significant that Rios delayed the
.evacuation of Iloilo until he became in- â¢
ftirmed that the Americans were com- :
ing, and there is curiosity here to learn
how that Important information reach
ed illo in advance of the movements
. <>.f the American transports and in the
absence of cable connections.. "Un
doubtedly, it was conveyed by a vessel. ;
and there may be a question raised as
â¢ to the legitimacy of the transmission of
; . news of the intentions, of the American '
. troops in advance <" this fashion. /.'â¢ v
V . One feature of General. Otis' report i
that has escaped mention so far is his
notice of the approaching meeting of
the so-called Filipino â¢ Parliament, '
which i.Â« to gather presumably at Ma
lays, about twenty miles from Manila.
â¢on the island of Luzon on Thursday
next. A good deal of Interest Is at
tached to this meeting, as General Otis
reports that, by the attendance, . the
strength of Agulnaldo's party can be
trauged. That this is waning rapidly is
' not doubted, and General Otis feels ,
that when the attempt is made to con- j
vene the Parliament it will be found :
V that Aguinaldo has lost his control of
the majority and cannot command even
a working coalition. .Such a state of
â  affairs would tend to make easier the
â¢task of the military authorities of the
. T'nitod States of establishing peace
j fully a temporary form of government
for the Philippines that will command :
â  the- support of the people find receive j
the approval of the civilized world.
;â¢' -General Otis has not yet published j
the proclamation by President McKin
ley,.which was cabled from Washing
ton to him about a weak ago. Feeling
â¢ full of confidence in his Judgment, .the :
' officials here are not disposed' to ques.- i
tlon his withholding the proclamation j
from the Filipinos, though it would
S'-'-m that the main purpose in pre- i
paring and cabling it was to soothe and ;
'. . satisfy the Filipinos and counteract, the !
insidious attacks the Spanish, element :
has been making upon the integrity of
American intentions respecting the
; Philippines.
.Admiral Dewey was heard from by
. eal>le at the Navy Department to-day.
but made no reference to the political
situation In the islands.. He reported
â¢ that he had found a building suitable '
: . for a naval hospital at Cavite and ask
.. Ed authority from the department to
establish it at once. If was not gath
" er.ed' that there is : an unusual amount
â¢â  of. sickness among the American sail

NEWS OF MASSACRE
CONFIRMED BY RIOS
MADRID, Jan. 3.â General Rios
cables from Manila confirming the re
port that all the Spaniards at Balabac,
an island of the Philippine group, situ
ated thirty miles Â«"iith of Palawan,
have been nss;issinated with the ex
ception of the women, whose release is
being asked for.
LONDON. Jan. 3.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says: "In
the rebellion at Balabac, Naval Lieu
! tenant Bellamy was beheaded. The
1 rebels also murdered a doctor and sev
[ eral other Europeans. A punboat fired
on the rebels, but its commander was
j unable to effect the release of the
â  women."
SENATOR PERKINS IS
AGAINST EXPANSION
. BOSTON, Jan. 4.â ln the course of a
speech at the annual banquet of the
Merchants' Association to-night Sena
tor Perkins of California said:
The payment of a money consideration i
divests the Philippine proposition of sen
timent and reduces it to a business trans- ;
action. The islands are over WOO miles
from the nearest State in thu Union. They
are situated in the tropics, with no local !
causes to modify the heat of the torrid ,
zone. The great fall of rainâ the average ;
at Manila being C<9 inches, and on some
of the other islands 158 inches per annum :
âmakes the humidity of the atmosphere ]
' so dense that the heat at times is almost i
i unbearable to those who are not natives, |
! the mean temperature being M degrees i
' Fahrenheit, the minimum being 59 de
grees. ' %
The purcnhse of the Philippine Islands
! will make them a Territory of the United i
i States, and the ten millions or more tur
bulent and mixed Asiatic peoples will be- |
come the wards if not citizens of this
! nation. While it may be possible to have i
a military government and tax the people i
' of the Philippines without giving them I
'. representation, no one. I think, will deny
i that under our constitution the children
: born In the islands, after the proup be
! comes a territory of the United States,
; will be American citizens.
There can be no colonization of the
inlands by Americans, as there is no pos
sible inducement to immigrate to a coun
try whero chuWa and other intestinal qis
aml smallpox, are epidemic nine
! months in the year.
I It is said by thÂ» War Department that
It will require 50.000 United States troops â 
to maintain order in Cuba after all of tne i
i Spanish troops have been returned to ;
! Spain. We now have 20.500 troops in Ma
i nila, and if we are to set up a military j
i government in all of the Philippine Isi- i
this army must ue very much in
creased in numbers.
The Secretary of the Navy in his an
i nual report says if we are to retain the ;
! Philippine Islands this Congress should !
' order the building of fifteen vessels of i
i war; likewise three cruisers will be \
i Fufflcient for this Congress to authorize. ;
On this basin it !s easy to estimate that
the annexation of the Philippine Islands
! means a burden upon the taxpayers of the
! country of at least $15,000,000 per annum.

lof Senator Morrill. It is customary not
to transact any business whatever on
euch occasions, but there is a possibility
! that a message may be received from the
! President transmitting the peace treaty,
I as it is known to be the general desire
I that the treaty shall formally be laid be
; fore the Committee on Foreign Relations
! at the earliest possible moment, so that
the committee may make its report aa
promptly us consistent with its duty iv
the premises.
A session of the Senate will be held on
Thursday, but there Is a movement look- j
Ing to an adjournment from that day !
until the following Monday, based on the
ability that there will not be a full
attendance of Senators so soon after the
holidays. This plan will be antagonized
by the friends of the Nicaragua canal ami I
other Senators who are championing j
special measures, and it now appears
quite probable that they will be able to
hold the Senate for at least another day [
of the week. There will be two months
of the session left to a day from the date
of leconvening, and the time will be fully
occupied if half the work that is planned
is to be done. None of the regular ap
propriation bills have passed the Senate
and the river and barbor bill is to be
i to the regular list this session.
None regard the treaty of less importance
than the supply bills, and it will be
pressed along with them when reported,
practically without regard to other bills.
Of other measures of magnitude which
will press for consideration in the Senate
during the session, the Nicaragua bill will
t;tkt precedence, but it will be urgently
U by the Hawaiian government bill,
the anti-scalpers' till and the Interstate
Commerce Commission bill, v< say nothing
obability concerning measures
for the mcrease of the standing army and
of the navy. Senator Elkins and other
friends of "that measure will also con
tinue to urge the bill regulating the regis
tration of foreign-built vessels wrecked in
American waters.
.-.Â» are only the m<.st important ques
tions demanding consideration in the
weeks remaining. Every Senator has a
number of measures of less importance.
The Nicaragua canal bill will command
the right of way at the beginning of the
â¢a, and will hold its place if it is
mude evident that a vote can be secured
on it before the appropriation billa and
the treaty are to be taken up. If it can
not be disposed of before these are
brought up it will be temporarily dis
placed fr.<m time to time. Th<- triends of I
11 maintain, however, that debate |
is practically exhausted, and they are
I .! of securing a vote at no very dis- i
tant date. They profess to feel very much
encouraged by the preliminary report or
th< Walker Commission, which was made
public last week. Senator rullom has
given notice of a motion to take up the
jinti-Bcalping bill an soon as the canal
bill is out of the way.
There is a growing belief that the treaty
will not be made the subject of long de
bate and what two weeks ago was a
strong probability of its ratification may |
be said now to be a certainty. Nothing i
1.-ss than some unforeseen emergency can J
urevent the Senate's favorable action
upon it at the present session. There aro
features in the treaty which many Sena
tors consider objectionable, but the tact
that it is a treaty of peace and that they.
as a rule have noiaing in its stead to j
offer will prevent any factious opposition.
So far as the opponents have a plan, it
is to let the treaty go through and then
devote themselves to shaping legislation
consequent upon lta ratification. They !
may offer their amendment committing ;
this Government against an attempt to
exercise sovereignty in the Philippines, j
but they do not expect It to become af.
part of the document.
The treaty will be discussed in execu
tive session, but the Senators will con .
tinue to make speeches in the open Sen- s
ate on Senator A est's anti-expansiMggatr
THE CZAR WELCOMES WQ
AMERICAN OCCUPATOti
NEW YORI^Tan. 3.â â GfcajA^t&X?
Cyril Vladimirovitch of Russia, whirls
on his way to his own country to at
tend the wedding of his sister, was wel
comed to-day by the Russian colony of
this city with a church service in the
Russian Orthodox Church. Bishop
Nicholas, retiring prelate of the Rus
sian church in America, who will take
ship with him to-morrow, presided at
the services and made an address. The
little church was decorated especially
for the occasion. The Duke received
the representatives of the press in the
state parlor of the Waldorf-Astoria,
which was decorated with palms and"
roses. The Duke said:
"I believe you will have much trouble
with the natives in the Philippines; in
fact, in my judgment, you will have
war with them sooner or later. As far
as Russia is concerned, the presence
of the United States in the East is en
tirely satisfactory. I believe it will be
a new factor for peace in the affairs of
the Orient."
The Grand Duke will sail on the
Fuerst Bismarck to-morrow.

ACCUSED OF
BLOWING UP
THE MAINE
THE BATTLESHIP MAINE.
HAVANA, Jan. 3. â The city is much excited to-night by
an open charge, made in El Reconcentrado, the organ of "Cuba
Libre," that Zecarias Bresmes, a Spanish Judge, now a fugitive
from .Havana, was one of those actively engaged in the plot
which resulted in the destruction of the Maine.
El Reconcentrado to-day gave a sketch of Bresmes' career
previous to last February, charging him with various crimes.
The paper will say to-morrow:
'When the Maine came into Havana harbor Bresmes open
ly declared in the Spanish cafes that such an act of audacity on
the part of the Yankees could not pass without stringent punish
ment. His threats were direct and boded destruction to the
American ship. His associates were Felipe Gonzalez, Dion Sio
Vega and Eusebio Azcue, all Spaniards. Others with him were
officers of volunteers. All these men boasted that the Yankees
were about to get their dues, though no charge can be directed
against any save Bresmes. â¢ '
'He and the hot-headed Spaniards of Murallo street met
nightly at a house near the corner of Murallo and Habana
streets, where the public know the plot against the Maine was
concocted, and all arrangements were completed there. When
the explosion took place Bresmes was in the Tacon Theater with
\ His. friends. Wt the sound of the explosion he cried:
\â¢^iwV\g9es the Maine."
Â¥Ch)ampagne was drunk in honor of the
l terrible event at the moment when others
were vaguely inquiring of one another
what had happened.
\\/NB^e^TibÂ§' name was mentioned before the American Court
: enquiry, but not sufficient evidence was then forthcoming to
} warrant any action, and all reference to him was suppressed in the
published report.
I saw Captain Sigsbee to-day, but of course was unable to
secure any comment from him. His one remark was: "I hope
to see those punished who sent my good ship and my beloved,
men to the bottom of Havana harbor."
Cubans here almost without exception 'regard El Recon
centrado's charges as beyond dispute. Bresmes is now said to
be hiding in Spain.
QUAY INDORSED
IN THE CAUCUS
Needs Nineteen Votes to
Be Re-elected.
HIS OPPONENTS JUBILANT
LOUDLY PROCLAIM THAT HE
CANNOT SUCCEED.
Much Depends Upon the action of
the State Supreme Court in the
Case Against the
Senator.
Special Dls:>atrh to The Call.
TIARRISRT'RO. Pa.. Jan. 3.â Despite the I
efforts of the opponents of Senator Quay '
to cause a postponement of the Senatorial ;
caucus until a later day. the adherents
of the senior Senator carried their point ;
to-night and obtained the Indorsement of !
their favorite by 109 of the 164 Republicans
of the Pennsylvania Legislature. This is
nineteen less than the number required ;
to elect a United States Senator on Joint
ballot, the total membership being 254, of
which 128 is a majority.
The anti-Quay leaders are jubilant over !
the result of the caucus, and claim that â 
the man they are fighting cannot succeed
himself in the Senate. On the other hand,
the Quay people and Senator Quay him
self express confidence of ultimate vie- 'â 
tory. They say that of the absentees two (
members of the House are kept away by
sickness and will vote for Quay. This
would leave him seventeen votes short of
the number necessary to elect, and the
efforts of the Quay leaders will be direct
ed during the next two weeks toward
securing these votes. It goes without say-
Ing that they will be just as bitterly op- ]
posed in the future by the group of men I
who have made the fight against Quay as j
they have been in the past,
i The Quay leaders during the past few
days have been claiming anywhere from
118 to l.'Jo votes in the caucus. The fact
that the actual figure was away below
their lowest claim is regarded by many
here as a source of great disappointment
to them. This is the claim of people who
are strong in the belief that Senator Quay
is beaten.
Undoubtedly the decision of Senator
David Martin at an early hnur this morn
ing to remain in the caucus had muchtodo

SENT FREETO MEN
The State Medical Institute Discovers a
" Remarkable Remedy for Lost
Vigor.
ARE SENDING FREE A TRIAL PACKAGE
TO ALL WHO WRITE. , (>
Free samples of a most remarkable
remedy are being distributed by the State
Medical Institute, Fort Wayne. Ind. It l
cured so many men who had battled for
years against the mental and physical
suffering of lost manhood that the insti- â â 
tute has decided to distribute free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment and all men who suffer with
any form of sexual weakness, resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele, or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home. ... . . ',
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength .
and development Just where It is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func- 'â 
tions "and has been an absolute success
in all cases. A request to the State Med-
ical Institute, 193 First National Bank
building. Fort Wayne, Ind., stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will be complied with. The institute
is desirous of reaching that great class
of men who are unable to leave home to
be treated and the free sample will en-
able them to see how easy it is to be
cured of sexual weakness when the !
proper remedies are employed. The in-
stitute makes no restrictions. Any man j
who writes will be sent a free sample,
carefully sealed In a plain package so
that Its recipient need have no fear of
embarrassment or publicity. Readers are
requested to write without delay. '"b ,-i
with the success of the efforts of ttie
anti-Quay people. Senator Quay has ex
pressed all along that Martin would be
with him when the time came to make
his vote effective, but others well in
formed on the situation have felt that if
Martin found it possible to defeat Quay
he would throw all the strength of h.s
political power against him.
All agree that much depends upon the
action that the State Supreme Court will
take in Philadelphia on January 7 on the
proceedings brought before that body
through a writ granted recently, the ef
fect of which is to bring the criminal
proceedings against Senator Quay before
the Court of Review. If the proceedings
are quashed by the Supreme Court Mr.
Quay will assuredly be re-elected. If. on
the contrary, the court refuses to inter
fere with the regular course of the legal
procedure against Senator Quay and de
cides that he must stand trial on the in
dictments found against him, there can
be no doubt that the position of his op
ponents will be greatly strengthened.

AT LAST THE
INFAMOUS RATES
ARE DEMANDED
Oakland Held Up for an In

Cent for Water.
Held Off Till Yesterday so That a Deceptive

Fmm henceforth Oaklanders must pay
extra for taking a bath. The. infamous
Bchedule of wattr rates passed at the
behest of the combined companies last
March went into full force and effect to
3ay and the public will be legally cinched
for the remaining six months of this fiscal
rear.
The following exhibit shows what has
romp to pass. They are the bills of. W.
J. Abernathy, who lives at $11 Thirty

TheÂ«=e figures are taken from the re
reipts in the possession of Mr.- Abernathy,
end a call at the' office of the water com
pany by a reporter verified their cor
rectness.
This enormous raise in the water rates
coming Just at this time is possessed of
very forceful significance/ It shows that
the water companies are planning to
make a deceitful showing before the City
Council when they file their statements
upon which the schedule shall be based
which will go into effect July 1 of this
year and continue one year.
The City Council two- weeks ago passed
the ordinary resolution â  instructing the
clerk to inform the water companies that
they must file their annual report of all
expenditures and receipts for 1898 so that
the Council can commence, in February
â to fix the schedule for the next fiscal year.
These reports must be filed under the
l.i\v before the 31st day of January in
tl.<- succeeding year to the one covered by
the report. These reports must contain
etailed statement of every payment
from every house, public building or
other place served by the companies.
These reports. for 1S&8' will contain the
receipts at the lower- rate and will not
show one cent Of . the receipts for the
six months commencing January 1. dur
ing which the company will be charging
xttistionate rate.- guaranteed them
by an obliging Council. â â¢
Another significance connected with
this sudden raise in water rates is that
a city campaign is now opening and that
s-'-v. ral hi the Councilmen are candidates
for re-election. It is hardly- to bte sup
posed that the voters will support any of
the men who voted last March to saddle
such a steal upon the city as is now be
ing carried out.
.An inquiry at the office of the Contra
Costa Company brought out some inter
esting information. It was stated that
from now on the company will charge the
new schedule, : the honors of which, at the
time ii was passed, belonged to Council
men Woodward and Henneberry primar
ily, and to Councilmen Heitmann, Brosna
han. Earl and' Watkinson secondarilyâ the
former two having introduced it and the
whole six having, voted for it.
At the water company's office it was ex
plained that the raise would not be a very
large one, and would only amount to 10
or 15 cents on houses where the rate has
beeii SI per month. Investigation outside
proves, that the rate on a house paying
Jl ;Â«5 Is now $2 55. which is a raise of a lit
tle over .;i p.-r centâ which the cashier
courteously said is small.
"You bi Id, "our first charge is
made on the basis of the amount of space
the house occupies. Then we charge for
irrigating, so much a square foot. After
that, if there ts a bath in the house there
is ;t small charge for that. Then we are
also enabled under the schedule to make
another charge for a closet if there be one
attached to the house. Of course there is
a difference between; one and two story
houses. Hitherto we have not charged
for closets, but we are' doing so this
year."
Had the cashier not been quite so busy
he might have gon.e on a little farther and
said that "under the schedule we charge
so much extra for a horse or a cow, so
much for washing windows with hose, so
much in the public schools for the amount
of space they occupy and just a small
amount per pupil. We also charge special
for laundries and very special rates
for every branch of the municipal service
that uses water, with extra attention to
thp fire hydrants, for the planting and re
] tiring of which, under the new ordi
nance, we arc also entitled to collect gen
erously"âand all this would have been
is true .is what the cashier did say
Wlipn the Water Committee of the
Council made its investigation last Feb
ruary into the affairs of the water com
panies it took their figures and allowed
generously for all possible margins, after
which it fixed a schedule that would al
low fi per cent investment on the inflated
capitalizations of the' companies. The
rate? now being charged are just about
twice what would have been collected
under the ordinance, the preparation of
which was undertaken with much con
scientiousness and care.
This ordinance, however, as all of Oak
land knows, was thrown aside by the
"solid six" and one prepared by Mr. Hen
neberry was substituted. There was some
Irregularity Ã¼bout thfs, and then came
forward Major K. W. Woodward, who
had been appointed but a week, but who
was already furnished with an elaborate
schedule and defense of tne water com
panies, which he claimed to have pre
pared, but which was. proved at the time
were prepared by employes of the water
combine. This is the schedule which is
now lii'inp foisted on â  the public and
which will pay the. water companies for
the next six months fully 15 per cent In
terest on their inflated capitalizations,
while the law allows, them 6 per cent.
As the water companies "came to
gether" in January, of last year and
rained the rate on a 50-cent house to $1 95,
and as there is now the same "under
standing" between the two companies,
the raisp on January 1 was general.
In this connection it Is interesting to
note that last October The Call publish
ed exclusively the statement that the wa
ter companies were resurveying every
house for the purpose of enforcing the ex
tortionate Woodward schedule, which
was to go into effect at the close of last
year or the beginning of this year. At
that lime the presidents of the two com
panies rushed into print and indignantly
denied that they were doing any such
tiling or that they contemplated any
raise on the rates then in force.
For the past six months little by little
the Woodward schedule has been applied
to the municipal buildings, and where $20
per month was formerly paid at the City
11:111. the bill suddenly, jumped to $110.
X conservative estimate of the effect of
the Woodward ordinance if put into full
force over the rates fixed by the commit
tee and guaranteeing fully fi per cent on
the investment would place the steal now
commenced at $250,000 for the fiscal year.
COMPANIES TO COMBINE.
Contra Costa Stock Takes a Sig
nificant Jump.
OAKLAND, Jan.' 3.â Considerable ex
citement was caused. In Oakland to-night
by the announcement that the stock of
the Contra Costa Water Company had
taken a sudden Jump from $50 to $65 per
share, and $63 was being refused. Last
Friday the stock could not be sold for $50.
It was openly stated t"hat the Contra
Costa had absorbed the Oakland or Din
gee Company, and that henceforth there
was to be no competition.
j One of the most prominent men con
nected with the companies was asked to
night by a Call reporter if the report were
true. He partially confirmed the start
ling information.
"There has been no consolidation yet,"
he said, "but the two companies will cer
tainly come together. No other course
can be expected, and negotiations have
been pending for some time between the
two companies.
"The Contra Costa has got to the end
! of its rope, and ils rival is as badly off.
When the competition began the Contra
Costa Company had only used a little
| more than half of its bonds. Now it nas
used them all, and has not paid a cent
; in interest on stock for four years.
"When you see stock jump suddenly
I from 50 to 65 you may kn"W there is
something substantial behind itâ and
I there is. As yet, however, the two com
panies have not consolidated. The past
season lias shown that the two companies
together only have about enough water to
supply Oakland, and competition is no
â  longer possible. Two years ago the Con
| tra Costa people wanted to buy out their
i rival, but Dingee wanted altogether too
much. Now it is different, and the two
I must and soon will come together.
i "The Contra Costa Company has been
! forced to open an immense pumping plant
at Alvarado, and this has cost it nearly
| one-fourth of its entire bonded Indebted
ness. Both companies fully realize that
I their combined plants are necessary to
tide Oakland over a dry year, and "they
'also realize that for the protection of
their stockholders they must come under
one general management. This is the sit
: nation that caused the stork to jump so
I heavily in to-day's market. I hear that
stock sold a few days ago for 50 was held
to-day although 6:> was offered. Some
changed hands, however, at 68. That is
the whole story, and absolutely reliable."
DEATH OF
A PIONEER
Henry Matthews Passes
Quietly Away at His
Home in Oak
land.
OAKLAND. Jan. 3â After spending a
fruitful life of nearly 76 years. Hen
ry Matthews, millionaire capitalist,
passed away peacefully at his home,
| 1557 "Webster street, to-day. For the past
four years his health has been failing and
during the greater part of that period he
had been confined to his home, so that the
final summons came not unexpected. His
life was one that through enterprise, firm
; will-power, generous impulses and ster
ling character had raised him from a boy
I at sea to a man of riches and contented
CAPTAIN HENRY MATTHEWS,
old age. A native of England, he had
sailed the world over prior to 1846, and
i when in that year he arrived In San Fran
! Cisco from Honolulu the present metrop
i olis across the bay was but a cluster of
i rude houses and was called Yerba Buena.
i He had come here to join General Fre
mont, who was then at Monterey, but
i lack of funds prevented him from accom-
I plishing the object set out upon. In San
; Francisco he accepted a position as ware
houseman in charge of the general store
j of Frederick Ward and William Smith,
' then located at what is now corner of
i Merchant and Montgomery streets. After
ward he went to the mines and finally he
i conducted a wholesale lumber business.
He was also for some yean one of the
harbor pilots. There was no movement
' In San Francisco in the early days that
, ho did not assist liberally, and he always
showed the truest public spirit. He was' a
j member of both vigilance committees,
I that of '51 and that of '56. and he did his
| share toward stamping out corruption
arid crime. Twice has he been honored
i with the vice presidency of the Society of
1 California Pioneers, of which he was "one
j of the oldest members, and his interesting
. narratives of his travels through Europe
I and Mexico are perhaps stlil fresh i:i
1 memory of his confreres of that organiza
j tion.
He was a family man, devoted to his
! wife and children and vory domestic in
! his tastos. The bubble and excitement of
I the political sea had no charms for him.
The fact that he played the first musical
I instrument at a religious service in this
i State at an Episcopel gathering hold at
what is now the corner of ("lay and Kear
ny streetsâ was considered by film a great
er distinction than had he held any potitl
j cal honors. The flute he played on that
occasion he christened "the sacred flute,"
and only recently he made a gift <>f it
to the Society of Pioneers. He was also a
member of Golden Gate Lodge No. 30, F.
and A. M.
Mr. Matthews had resided in Oakland
for the past twenty years. He held the
love and respect of all who knew him
He leaves a widow, three sonsâ William
HL, Henry, J,. M. and John W. Matthewsâ
I and a daughter, Mrs. Robert Oryan, at
| present residing in Rome, Italy. At his
own request, the funeral services will be
unostentatious, and will bo held next
Thursday from the family residence, and
the remains will be interred in the family
plat at Mountain View Cemetery.

RUBICON WON
WITH A BIT
OF COAXING
The Ring Laid Most
Liberal Odds.
OUTSIDERS FIRST AT OAKLAND
STAMINA BEAT ROBERT BOKTNER
AT 10 TO 1.
Jerry Hunt Lost His Field in the
Mvd â Clarando Quite a Filly.
Montgomery Unbeatable
as Usual.
Perhaps the most astonishing thing
about the racing at Oakland yesterday
was the long price laid against Rubicon, j
The previous effort of Lanigan's big I
chestnut horse was in a short six furlong j
scramble, and he cut a very' small ligure.
However, In horse racing it is necessary
to "throw out" some trials. The going j
yesterday was certainly to his liking, the
track being a sea of mud. He was asked
to beat Roslnante, Moringa and Frohman.
The first named mare was an unknown
quantity in slushy footing, and Moringa
looked the contender. As on Monday,
when 12 to 1 was laid against San Venado,
the ring got out of line and chalked at i
one stage of the betting 2^> to 1 against
Rubicon. At post time, this had given i
way to 4to 5. Piggott tossed the leg over
the Lanigan entry, and at once going to
the front was never headed, leading Ros
inante out a couple of lengths in I:4L'' 4 .
Sefore half the distance had been cov
ered Moringa hoisted distress signals, fin
ishing a trashy looking third.
The other events, with une exception,
were below mediocrity so far as class was
concerned. Martello at lv and Stamina
quoted at an equally long price were a
couple of the prize winners. Rubicon
and Montgomery were the winning favor
ites.
Schreiber's Ulm looked so nicely placed
that the colt ruled a 6 to 5 choice for the
mile selling run that opened the after
noon's sport. Bumped soon after the
start, he never cut much figure. The 10
to 1 shot, Martello, ridden to good advan- !
tage by little Johnny Daly, won at the
end quite handily from the rank outsider,
None Such.
After warming 1 up like a cyclone, P. i
Ryan's Cyril was sent to the front a I
warm favorite for the sprint next decided.
He finished third. Clarando, with
"Skeets" Martin in the saddle, jumped '
away in the load, winning cleverly at the j
wire from Good Hope.
Polka proved a false favorite in the
seven furlong run. Jerry Hunt, piloted
by Piggott, spreadeagled his field. Ma
lay was second, two lengths before Dun
praise.
.The mile selling affair saw Elidad, the
one-time famous mud lark, go to the post
favorite. He became lost in the shuffle
and Stamina, a lv to 1 shot, ridden by
Johnny Rcirt". Blipped in and beat the good
thing, Robert Bonner, two lengths.
One to three was quoted against Billy'
Magrane's crack sprinter Montgomery in
the betting on the final six furlong spin
and he fairly rolled in. O'Connell secured
the place easily from Sweet William

CHANGE OF THE
ADMINISTRATION
AT CITY HALL
An Unusually Quiet Time at the
Transfer of Various Depart
ments to the Recently
Elected Officials.
Much Work to Be Done Between This
Time and the Close of the Year, When
the New Charter Will Revolu
tionize Matters.
The biennial transfer of the municipal
government from one set of officers to an
other has taken place, 'i he thrifty nine
of the Board of Supervisors and the dis
honored majority of the Board of Educa
tion are but memories of a nightmare that
unfortunately carries its hideousness be
yond its existence and weights the people
of the city with burdens that must be
borne. Men were retired yesterday from
a public life that had no honor to a pri
vate oblivion that will have no dignity.
They placed upon themselves a stigma of
public shame and gave to San Francisco
a heritage of evil laws, heavy debts and
burdensome taxation.
The corridors of the City Hall echoed
yesterday to the tread of thousands of
feet. Men of all sorts and conditions were
there for a purpose, some to give the last
touches of their public service and others
to taste the Itrst sweets of political tri
umph. Politicians swaggering in the tan- â 
portance of new-found power hastened
from office to office to see that the fa- |
vored fines were cared for according to ]
agreement. Hundreds of eager-faced,
rough-garbed men hang around the offices |
of the Strex I Superintendent, hoping i
against hope that some small employment i
â would be given to them to relieve their [
neces.siti.-s.
Camp followers of the new bosses hung !
around the corridors In expectancy that !
come favor might reach their hands. Low
browed, vicious looking "fellows they were,
fit only for the rough-and-tumble rowdy-
Ism of the primaries, not the prizes of
politics. Here and there they went, vow
ing futile vt-ngeance because they did not
receive the favors they sought and did
not deserve. Some day they will pledge
their worth at the primaries for a "pull"
to got them out of jail. A throng gath
ered in the different police courts to see
the new Judges assume their judicial dig
nity, and many wondered who will be the
new clown of the police bench.
Movement and confusion, a babel of
tongues and a hastening of feet charac
terized the morning hours. The actual
and significant ceremony of the transfer
of the city government did not take place
until the afternoon, when the old Board
of Supervisors Btepped d'>wn and out and
the new board took possession. But dur
ing the morning the transfer of the vari
ous municipal departments was made. In
many offices some clerks were retained to
initiate their successors in i"c duties of
their positions. All the courtesies of ex
change were given. The retiring officers
showered upon their successors congratu
lations they did not feel, and the new
comers accepted weil wishes with a pride
they could not hide.
At the noon hour the affairs of every
municipal department were moving
Fmoothly. It was remarked as an un
usual circumstance and a very creditable
one that the outgoing officials and their
deputies did not loot the great civic
building, as has been done at the close of
many administrations. Hitherto it has
been considered to be a sacred privilege
for retiring municipal employes to steal
everything that was not nailed. This year
the custom was not observed. In many
of the offices, however, notably that of
the Assessor, it was observed that very
little attention had i een given to cleanli
ness. Most of the janitors, it would ap
pear, had occupied sinecures.
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon the crowds
in the corridors deserted their post and
congregated in the chambers of the
Board of Supervisors. At 2 o'clock the
city government was to be transferred
formally to the new administration. The
gvea.t assembly hall df the Supervisors
wns crowded to the doors. The main floor
presented a maze of expectant and dis
appointed faces, showing too clearly. that
if some had won by the change of gov
ernment many had lost. A turn of the
political wheel had thrown them Into the
street, but they could not resist the
temptntion to see how the other fellows
liked the change.
In the gallery of the main chamber, in
the committee rooms and waiting apart
ments the crowds surged. Shortly after
2 O'clock the members of the retiring
and incoming boards, followed by Judges,
department officers, clerks and Invited
guests, filed into the assembly chamber.
After a brief ceremony and the presenta
tion of credentials the- new board was in
stalled into office. Tt was not uninterest
ing to watch the faces of the new mem
bers and to wonder which of them may
some day be pictured as the solid eight or
nine of the administration. In the retire
ment of the old board there were two
Unique featuresâ "Cappun" Delany's mus
tache and Dr. Rottanzi's public declara
tion that he had been honest during his
term of office. That declaration pro
voked a storm of laughter which the
Mayor made no attempt to suppress, as
he smiled himself.
After Clerk Russell had read the min
utes to himself for an hour Mayor Phelan
delivered his message. The document
â was a voluminous and well-written one
that dealt critically with subjects of the
highest concern to the municipality. The
Mayor made many important recom
mendations, most of them dependent, he
declared, upon the charter for operation.
I At the conclusion of the Mayor's message
the new Board formally organized, ap
pointed its committees and made a few
appointments. In honor of the inaugura
tion of the new administration the Mayor
gave a banquet at the Maison Riche List
night to the new Board of Supervisors.
This ended a day that perhaps will not
be duplicated in many years in San Fran
cisco. If the charter be ratified by the
Legislature this city will not again see
the spoilsmen of politics gathered in
hordes to take possession every two years
of the City Hall and all it represents.
OFFICERS READY
FOR BUSINESS
Superior Court and County
Clerk's Office Or
ganized.
A corps of perspiring City Hall janitors
busied- themselves yesterday cleaning up
and cleaning out, getting ready, in fact,
(or the Incoming officials to proceed with
their duties. Early in the morning the I
Superior Court met in bank for the pur- \
pose of electing a presiding Judge and on
the first ballot this honor fell to Judge j
Daingerfield, who will act In the capac- ,
ity mentioned during the present year.
James Coffroth was elected to succeed j
himself in the position of secretary o^the '
court. The matter of assigning the vari- 'â¢
ous Judges was then taken up. Judge i
Dunne was assigned to the department
lately vacated by Judge Wallace, Judge j
Murasky was assigned to the department |
vacated by Judge Dunne, while Judge j
Carroll Cook and Judge Lawlor were as- !
signed to departments 11 and 12, respect- !
ively. The other members of the court i
will remain in their old positions. -j
After the work of making the assign
ments was concluded an order was made
that a list of 144 talesmen for the Grand j
Jury be drawn and that a list of 2400 for !
trial juries be drawn for service. The ',
Court Commission and Insanity Commis- i
sion were ordered continued In office with
out change, this concluding the labors of
the court In bank.
County Clerk Deane has about conclud
ed his labors and his office is in a condi
tion to proceed in good order. Joseph
Goddard, long and favorably known as
clerk of Department 1, is in the private
office of the County Clerk, and enjoys the
position of confidential deputy, a position
to which he is adapted and capable of

vid C â¢ martin With a
-" Gold Badge.
There was no ceremony attached to the
transfer of the Sheriff's office by Richard
I. Whelan to Sheriff-elect Henry S. Mar
tin. After the latter had taken his oath
of office before Deputy County Clerk
George McComb at 9:30 a. m. he repaired
to the Sheriff's office, -â where he was met
by ex-Sheriff Whelan, who welcomed him
to his new position with a warm hand
clasp, stating that he would be on hand
every day and of tener if necessary to
give the benefit of his experience. Sheriff
Martin thanked him heartily, and then
Deputy McComb swore the deputies who
are to serve under the new official.
. Mr. Whelan then took Sheriff Martin
around to the three branch jails and sur
rendered the keys to him. The latter re
turned at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and
presented Under Sheriff David C. Martin
with a handsome gold badge, Indicative of
his office, as a token of respect and es
teem, as the inscription set forth.
When Sheriff Martin was asked as to his
policy in conducting his office he replied,
"I shall endeavor to conduct my office as
economically as possible, but with the
object to obtain the best results. I shall
try to satisfy the people of this city and
county, for to them alone am I respon
sible. I will, do the best I know how."

JUDGE iV\URPHY
BEGINS WORK
District Attorney to /issk for
a Fourth Criminal
Court.
District Attorney I ). J. Murphy, accom
panied by tli. retiring officer. William S.
Barnes, presented his commission to
Judge Carrol] (V.,k yesterday morning,
and ii was inn liately spread on the
minutes by Clerk Oscar Tolle. Judge Mur
phy then Informed !'!'â¢â¢ court that lie had
appointed a. P. Black as his chief deputy,
and forthwith introduced him in person.
The District Attorney then took E. S.
Salomon to Department 11, Judge Lawler,
I and introducd him as assistant attorney
for that court, ami he performed a similar
Bervice tor John T. Graney. who is to be
his third assistant, in Department 6,
Judge Dunne.
The other appointments are John B.
Tungate, chief clerk; \C. H. Murphy,
clerk; J. R. Daniels, clerk, and \V. B. Me'e,
stenographer.
The first official act of Judge Murphy
was to make a motion in Judge Dunne's
court that A. 1,. Knott be brought over
from San Quentin for resentence for the
murder of Joseph Knauer in July, I!W7.
Knott was convicted and sentenced to be
hanged, in Judge Wallace's court, but ap
pealed to the Supreme Court, which af
firmed the judgment some time ago, but
Knott has not as -"ft been brought up for
resentence. This act on the part of Judge
Murphy is evidence that he will vigorous
ly prosecute all criminals. In regard to
that matter, the Judge had this to say:
"I propose to ask the Superior Judges
for a fourth criminal court in order to re
lieve the congested condition of the calen
dar. The jails are overcrowded with
j murderers and thugs, and T intend to as
sist personally in the prosecution of these
cases. I have asked the Sheriff to furnish
me with a list of the names of all prison
ers held in prison, with the nature of the
Charge, and I will go after them. I have
also asked the court room clerks to give
me a list of the cases pendlnr in the de
partments, the nature of the crime and
the length of time they have been on trial.
By vigorous effort T will clear the calen
dar to a considerable extent."
POLICE JUDGES
/\RE INSTALLED
The T\a/o New Dispensers
of Justice. Meet \A/lth a
Cordial Reception,
The four Police Judges took their
seats yesterday morning for the ensu
ing term. Judges Conlan and Mogan,
who were re-elected, came into court
as usual and proceeded to business
after swearing in their bailiff and sten
ographer. George Kelly is again bailiff
and Frank Vernon stenographer of
Judge Conlan's court, and D. W. Long
is stenographer and Thomas F. Barry
bailiff of Judge Mogan's court.
Judge Treadwell's courtroom was
packed with his friends when he took
his seat on the bench, and as he did
so he was loudly applauded. He was at
once presented with a beautiful wreath
from the Owl Club, of which he is a
member. After the applause had sub
sided Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds
said:
I now announce Judge Treadwell, the
duly elected Judge of this department,
who will take the bench. It is not neces
sary for me to say I have known Judge
Treadwell since I was a little boy, and
that I have always known him to be what
you know him to be. an honest and con
scientious man. Gentlemen, Judge Tread
well.
Judge Treadwell said in reply:
I will .state to the citizens of San Fran
cisco in assuming the duties of my office
that I will perform the duties of this of
fice under the law, and that 1 will fulfill
all the pledges and promises that I have
made to the people of the city and county
of San Francisco. A great deal has been
said about Police Courtsâ a great deal has
been said about me also In regard to my
candidacy as to whether or not I will per
-1 form the duties of this office under the
law and the constitution of the State of
California and of the United States, but
I will do it. I desire also to say that in
performing my duties I will adhere to
,the law, and I will be in my office dur
ing the time stated by the law that I
should be there. I have noticed within
the last ten years persons that are called
hangers-on around the Police Courts.
There is an ordinance against that, and
I will say that these hangers-on, so-called
hangers-on and persons who go around
saying they "can fix cases" will not be
permitted within the confines or the juris
diction of this court. These men have
been interfering with the due process of
lawâ they have been interfering with tha
attorneysâ they have been Interfering
with the police officersâ they have been
going on what are called straw bonds
and interfering In every conceivable way
with the due administration of the law
of the city and county of San Francisco.
I, as a Judge of this city and county,
| will not permit it. And I will also say
that when a case is presented for the con
sideration of this court every person
is entitled to a reasonable continuance,
but after that continuance has been
granted, unless a good and sufficient rea
son is stated to the court, there will be
no other continuances, because it clogs
the business of the court, and sometimes
criminals must he discharged because wit
nesses disappear.
Now, I will also state that I will treat
every attorney with due courtesy, but I
do not want any attorney to come and
make any misstatements to this court. I
will treat them all alike, as I shall every
I citizen who may have business in my
court, even those who do not like me and
have been my enemiesâ and if they should
come into this court of justice they can
rely upon it that justice will be meted
out to them, and I will treat them exact,
ly as If they were my best friends.
Regarding the issuance of search war
rants, I desire to state that I will not is
sue any search warrant against lodging
house keepers, hotel keepers or merchants
unless after due investigation It is shown
that a crime has been committed. ThÂ«
law is very strict on it, and the Judge
should be very careful in issuing thesa
i warrants, especially as they are issued
sometimes simply to gratify the whim of
some person who is really not entitled to
a search warrant under the law.
When a case is being heard in this
court I will not permit any person to in
terrupt me in my official duties by coming
on the bench and speaking to me, because
it is to my mind absolutely necessary that
I the Judge should hear every word that ia
j said.
1 wish to state further with re
gard to these drunken loafers who accost
people on the street and Insult them when
men- solicitations for money or alms are
refused they will be severely dealt with if
brought before me, as the citizens of San
Francisco should not be molested by these
people who will not work even when pror
i fered the same.
The Judge then swore in Howard
Vernon as the stenographer of the court
and Austin Langford as bailiff, and the
cases on the calendar were proceeded
with.
The friends of Thomas F. Graham.
! the other Judge, crowded his courtroom
and gave him a cordial reception when
he ascended the bench. H. L. Joach
| imsen, the retiring Judge of the court,
was on hand, and after warmly shaking
hands with the new Judge said:
Members of the bar present, I have
much pleaesure In introducing to you Hon.
Thomas F. Graham, Judge of Police
Court 3. I know of my own knowledge
that while prosecuting attorney of this
â  court the Judge has always been just
and has always tempered "justice with
mercy, and 1 am sure he will keep up the
position of this department and have this
court one of the best in the city and
county of San Francisco. Judge Graham,
1 wish you success.
After the applause had subsided
Judge Graham said:
1 thank you for your complimentary
remarks. 1 wish to state from my ob
servation of and association with Judge
Joachimsen I always found him an hon
est, conscientious and painstaking Judge,
always endeavoring to assist the weak
and unfortunate. The Judge's career on
the bench has been an honorable one and i
I hope in all his future undertakings he \
will be. as successful as he has been as |
a Police Judge. I wish to say to the
members of the profession, particularly
those who practice in the Police Courts,
that it is my purpose to discharge the
duties of the office and administer the
laws to the best of my ability and give
each and all equal and exact justice.
The Judge then swore in J. C. Mulli
gan as stenographer of the court and
John J. O'Connor as bailiff, and the
first case on the calendar was called.
DODGE RENEWS
HIS PLEDGES
Nevw Assessor and Assist
ants Succeed Slebe's
Regime.
Shortly after 9 o'clock Dr. "Washing
! ton Dodge, the new Assessor, appeared
iat his office, suave and smiling. He
I was cordially welcomed by John D.
| Slebe, the retiring Assessor. In a few
minutes the office was turned over to
the incoming official, without further
ceremony than mutual compliments be
tween Dr. Dodge and Mr. Siebe. As
sessor Dodge went before Registrar
| Biggy, received his certificate of elec-
I tion and took the oath of office. Then
he returned to his own office and an
nounced his appointees, who were sub-
I sequently sworn in by a deputy county
clerk. The Deputy Assessor has not
yet been selected, Dr. Dodge having
withheld the appointment for personal
reasons.
After taking charge of his office the
Assessor reiterated his ante-election
pledges to give equal iustice to rich
and poor alike and Vj assess the prop^
erty of corporations fairly and equita
bly. For the present a comparatively
small number of deputies will be en
gaged, more being added as the work
of levying the next assessment in
creases. Following are Assessor Dodge's
appointments: ; -^' 'â 
Edmund Godchaux, A. Ft. Henderson,
A. D. Miesegaes. George Tyroll, P. J.

Phelan Banquets Su-
pervisors.
Mayor James D. Phelan, in keeping
with his custom in the past, entertained
the members of the new Board of Su
pervisors at dinner last nisrht. The af
fair took place at a downtown restau
rant. Speeches were made by the men
who took office yesterday. They prom.
ised a businesslike administration of
the city during the year they will toe In

DISSATISFIED OFFICIALS.
They Want to Undo the Work of Two
Years Ago.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.â Alameda County
officials are already preparing to descend
upon the Legislature with a demand for
more help, notwithstanding the fact that
two years ago the same officialsâ or many
of them â went to Sacramento and agreed
upon the number of deputies which should
be attached to each office.
The new county government act wont
into effect tho first of the year and en
tirely reorganized the system under
which county officials are to be paid for
the next four years. Instead of allowing
immense appropriations for each depart
ment, which enabled the incumbents to
become independently rich in one term,
the new act provides a salary ranging
from three to four thousand dollars for
each county official and fixes the number
and payment of each of the deputies. It
is now claimed that the number of depu
ties Is too small in some instances, and
an effort will lie made to amend the bill
not yet one week in force so as to pro
vide a few more places for the faithful
There will be much opposition to the at
tempt to amend the bill.
In only one office is there an actual
necessity for additional assistance. The
County Treasurer with one assistant
cannot, it is claimed by those who know
do all 'the work required of him and con
duct his office in such a manner as his
bondsmen have a right to expect. Under
tho appropriation plan the County Treas
urer has always employed two men to
help him and this is taken as a pretty
good argument that two men are neces
sary.

COMMISSIONERS
FEAR TO OBEY
DAN BURNS
Peculiar Action of the
Board.
POLICE PATROLMEN ESCAPE
ONLY TWO DISMISSED FBOM THE
DEPARTMENT.
The Pension Board Provides for An
other Session at an Early
j&ate â Many More Heads
to Fall.
The Police Pension Commissioners did
not dare to obey yesterday the command
of Dan Burns, but by the very action they
took at their meeting- they proved that
the command had been given and they
â were expected to obey. The Commis
sioners did not even retire men that asked
to be retired. The men who had planned
to take the livelihood of their subordinates
were afraid to act, and as The ("all indi
cated an expose of their disgraceful
scheme prevented an outrage. Throe men
had sent their resignations as patrolmen
to the Commission which has been ever
eager to accept such offers in the past.
Those that resigned are absolutely un
fitted for service. They have no hope of
recovering from an Illness that has settled
upon them and necessarily they must be
retired. But the Commissioners, fearful
of the expose that had made clear to the
community the character of the pro
posed outrage on the department, would
not accept all of the resignations.
The purpose of this was to show that
the Commission is not eager to make
vacancies in the department. Fred
Smith, "W. H. Morehouse and Cha- :â¢â *
O'Malley. patrolmen, had resigned. The
leslgnations of Fred Smith and W. H.
Morehouse were accepted, but that of
Charles O'Malley was refused considera
tion on the ground that it had no- first
been considered by the Police Commission.
The Police Commission is the Pension
Commission. It would have taken the
Pension Commission fivo minute*- to re
solve itself Into the Police Commission,
accept the resignation and resumed Its
proceedings as the Pension Commission.
This was not done and only th^ two res
ignations were accepted, in mllourning.
however, the Pension Commission ad
journed to the call of the chair instead .f
to the first Monday in April, the stated
meeting. There will be much business
before the. Commission betw-on now and.
the adjournment of the State Legislature.
ATTORNEY BENNETT IN
THE ROLE OF PROTECTOR
TRIES TO EXTRICATE T. W.
SINCLAIR FROM JAIL.
But Sinclair's Brother Declares That
There Is No Need of Legal As
sistance â A Queer Case.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 3.
Some remarkable facts were developed
at the hearing of the petition of Fred
Sinclair to be appointed guardian of thÂ«
person and estate of his brother, Thomp
son W. Sinclair, before Superior Judg. 1
Hall this afternoon.
The petitioner and another -brother,
Dave Sinclair, clerk of Judge Greene's
court, first testified that T, W. Sinclair,
though 51 years of age, was much g^iven
to evils of the flowing bowl and that when
in his cups he would dispose of all of his
clothes, even to his shoes. On one occa
sion petitioner had placed the erring
brother in a home, where he took a cure,
but without lasting results. Also. that he
had come to him a few weeks ago and
asked to be placed once more in an insti
tution where he could be kept away from
liquor.
â¢'We arranged with, the Sheriff to have
Thompson plead guilty to a"â¢ trivial
charge," said the petitioner,, "and .then
Incarcarate him at the County Jail. This
was done at Thompson's request and of
his own volition. Subsequently, during
the middle of last month, F. W. Sawyer,
an attorney, railed on me and asked
whether 1 was going to prosecute my
brother for anything, and 1 told him the
circumstances plainly.. He told me then
that my brother wished some good coffee,
and. I sent it to the jail.".
A few days later witness had learned
that the incarcerated brother had trans
ferred to F. W. Sawyer and J. E. Ben
nett his entire interest of nearly $1000 in
the estate of the mother, who died in
Michigan.
Sawyer and Bennett appeared as attor
neys for Thompson YV. Sinclair to-day
and M. C. Chapman, as attorney for the
petitioner, put them on the stand. Ben
nett stated that he had first metTiis client
in the County Jail, where Brandes, the
man held for murdering his daughter, had
told him th.it Sinclair had asked for an
attorney. He consulted Sinclair, who, he
testified, had i"lil hini that, his brothers
were trying to have him declared incom
petent, an'l he wished to gel nut of jail.
Witnef* lenied that he had asked the
prisoner ?<> nominate him as guar.dlan. but
had suggested the name of J. G. Wright
of Berk' ley.
"Sinclair told me, too, that he was in
terested in the $15,000 estate of his mother,
but I lo not remember whether he said
his interest was $15.(mi0 or whether that
was tie value of the estate."
Hr-.netf next was asked about the
transfer of the prisoner's interest, and
the agreement was produced. It provides
for a fee of 3.3 1-3 per cent of the prisoner's
interest for legal services rendered in
protecting his rights. Witness, in answer
to another question, stated that he did
not regard it as strange that the pris
oner should enter into such an agreement
I with a stranger. On further examination
it developed also that the attorneys had
written to a sister of the prisoner asking
her, as executor of the mother's estate
to send on $100 with- which to get the
brother out of jail.
The petitioner, who is a reputable com
mission merchant, and his brother, Dave
declare that there is no contest over the
mother's estate, that the four children
will got share and share alike as soon as
It is ready for, distribution and they wish
now to have trie contract between their
erring brother and Sawyer & Bennett de
clared void, and thus protect him in his
interest. Sawyer * Bennett are just as
serious in lh.ir contention.
