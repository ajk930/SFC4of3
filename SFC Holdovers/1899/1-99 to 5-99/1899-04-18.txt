MAXILA, April i;.â I
have had an interview
with Le Garda. He said
that a committee of twenty-two
Filipinos has been appointed to
confer with the Peace Commis-
sion for the following purposes:
First â Jo obtain as large au
tonomic rights for the Filipino
people as possible.
Second â To bring about
peaceful relations between the
irgents and American author-
Third â To insist that Ameri
cans and Filipinos only shall oc
cupy public offices.
Arevalo, former aid to Aguin
.is mnv in Manila. He said
in an interview that if the Ameri
- would send emissaries to
linaldo now he thinks a
eful solution of the present
trouble would be probable.
Influenti.il Americans think
that this commission of rich Fili-
pinos is eager to protect their
property and has little influence
with the insurgents.

JOHN GARBER IS HOST AT
A REMARKABLE BREAKFAST
Millionaires Talk of the
White Mans Burden.
Huntingdon's Advice and Motto Is
to Grab Everything
in Sight
JOHN OARBER is the hero of local ,
clubdom. He, who is esteemed to
be the leader of the California bar
and one whose light is not dimmed
even in the brilliance of any
American legal constellation, has won
a triumph second to none in his history.
Hp has drawn around a breakfast
board the brightest and ablest minds
of the State and some of the nation. :
Under the inspiration of jrood fellow- i
ship and wine sparkling spirits have
flowed in wit and argument and men,
representing the highest achievements j
in mind and matter, money and brain,
have discussed with enthusiasm what
we ought to do or what we ought not
to do with the great problem of ex- |
MOST IsTOTJLBXjE BREAKFAST OF THIS SEASOU.
pansion, particularly as it is presented
in the Philippines.
The breakfast began with cocktails
and ended with a divided sentiment
that tho white men of the West should
take up the burden of the brown men
of the East. Strange as it may seem
decided efforts have been madp to keep
the incident of the Garber breakfast a
F^-ret. Why this should havp been
done no one seems to know except it
be that such master spirits as John
Garber drew t n his breakfast board
wish modestly to conceal their thoughts
upon great themes from the inspection
anl discussion />f the vulgar public.
The breakfast was given a week ago
last Saturday at the Pacific Union
Club. Among those who wÂ»re present

gle breakfast board was John Garner's
triumph. Men prominent in the field of
finance, letters, law, religion, philos
ophy, politics, education and in that
peculiar science which C. P. Hunting
ton arrogates to himself, were at that
I'inrd. . As might have been expected
the result was of exceptional interest.
At the conclusion of the breakfast,
which began at noon and was not end
i ed until 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the
thoughts of those present turned to a
discussion of timely topics, particularly
j of that which is of primary moment to
the people of the West â the possession
of the Philippines. The aggregated
wealth represented at that board might
buy the Philippines, but that was not
the point. Millionaires do not discuss
seriously at breakfast questions of bar
ter and sale.
Professor Le Conte opened the dis
cussion. In eloquent seriousness the
aged scholar argued against the theory
of America's expansion. America's
destiny, the speaker said, is not in the
direction of the Philippine Islands.
There is something more in American
ideals than commerce and commercial
success, and the honored professor of
Berkeley hoped that American states
men will realize this before it is too
late to return to firmer ground than
that upon which they now stand. The
polished eloquence of Professor Le
Conte may have been the inspiration
for the enthusiasm of the subsequent
discussion which reached a most un
expected climax in a personal debate
between Professor Howison and Rabbi
Voorsanger.
Professor Jordan followed Professor
Le Conte In the argument, and with the
success with which he attacks any sub
ject, acquitted himself well to the satis
faction of his hearers. Professor Jor
dan argued against expansion, as he is
sincerely of the opinion that the white
man has troubles of his own, without
taking unto himself those of the brown
men.
There was a murmur of gratified sur
prise wh"n C. P. Huntington gracicrus
ly consented to discuss the theme of the
afternoon. Everybody, present raised
his glass and drank in acknowledg
ment of the magnate's condescension.
<"". P. Huntington was in a pleasant
mood. More than that, ho was candid.
He made an announcement that is of
rational interest. He assured his hear-
ers that he never does anything for his
health, which is surprising in one of his
age, and that when he makes am ove he
knows what he is after. It was not
generally noticed that at this remark
George Crocker again drank the old
man's health.
Huntington annnunceil himself em
phatically in favor of expansion and on
the American possession of the Philip
pines. If we behave ourselves, Hunt
ington says that in two or three years
he may be building railroads in the
Philippines. That there might be no
mistake in reference to his meaning,
and that his bluntness might not be
misconstrued, the old railroad magnate
spoke from notes.
"Gentlemen," he Bald, "I believe that
expansion is a good thing for the com
mercial interests of this country. I
believe in snatching everything in
sight."
George Crocker again raised his glass
to his lips and Huntington #ontinued:
"That has been my mntto for a num
ber of years ;tnd I find that it pays far
better than conservatism. Expansion
would help California and especially !
Ran Francisco. I might mention that
in two or three years; if everything
turns out all right, th^ Southern Pacific
Company will be building railroads in
the Philippines. You are aware, per
haps, that we never do anything for
our health.
"They can do all the talking they
want to and caricature the ra*v work
of your Uncle Collis as they please, but
when the old man makes a move he un
derstands what he is after."
These words alone would make John
Garher's breakfast famous. Hunting
ton resumed his seat and received the
tribute of marked applause. The gen
tlemen at the board were becoming en
thusiastic. Even John Garber forgot
his staid dignity as host and applauded
with frequent interruptions of ap
proval.
D. O. Mills followed Huntington in
an advocacy of the same policy which
had been championed by the president
of the Southern Pacific Company. Mr.
Mills, under the inspiration of the
moment and the contagion of sympa
thetic spirits, declared that we will
neglect our manifest destiny if we do
not keep the Philippines and go further
to take a slice of China.
"While other nations," he said, "are
making themselves numerous it would
be a good thing for us to take a slice
of China while we are at it."
D. 0, Mills Urges Us to
Take a Slice of China*
Dr* Voorsanger, Professor How
ison and Joseph Le Conte in
Debate.
This constant suggestion to grab
everything in sight seemed to have a
depressing effect upon George Crocker.
As might have been expected, Pro
fessor George Howison agreed in opin
ion with D. O. Mills. It will be remem
bered, perhaps, that D. O. Mills Is re
sponsible for the chair of philosophy
which Professor Howison so creditably
fills at Berkeley.
When Professor Howison arose to
speak there fell upon the feasters a si
lence due to the abilities and opinions
of the distinguished scholar. Professor
Hnwison sees in the intervention of the
United States in the Philippines an act
of God. It is our God-given duty, he
says, to take up the burden that the
success of our arms has thrust upon us.
"The intervention of the United
States in the Philippines," he said, "is
an act of the providence of God. We
have received a God-given trust. It is
our duty to take up the white man's
burden and to show the effete mon
archies of Europe that when it comes
to enlightening the heathen and up
lifting humanity the United States are
in the van. This is the reason and
the justification for the interference of
the United States in the Philippines."
Oh most occasions the Rev. Dr. Jacob
Voorsanger is wrapped in a mantel of
self-restraint. He seldom gives ex
pression to emphatic opinions if he has
any, but it seems that the reverend
gentleman entertains, on his own ac
count, some very pronounced ideas on
the white man's burden. They are not
in accord with those of Professor Ho,w
ison, al.'.ough in matters philosophic
the two gentlemen are more frequently
in accord than in disagreement.
When Professor Howison saw in the
conquest of the Philippines the direct
act of God the Rev. Dr. Voorsanger
made caustic reply. He is unable to
see God anywhere in the affair ami
more than that he does not believe that
the vision of Professor Howison is any
keener than his own. He cannot bring
himself to believe that God takes any
particular pleasure in seeing Undo
fam's soldiers drill Filipino warriors
full of holes. Money and markets are
the bait, the reverend gentleman in
sists.
"I want to disagree," he said at the
breakfast, "with the men of finance. It
seems to me that it is the very height
of fnlly for us to pretend that the in
terference of this Government in the
Philippines will do the natives any
good. What we are after there and
what we are seeking is new territory
for business purposes, for rTew markets
and new trade. For heaven's sake, let
us not delude ourselves that when we
go down to the Philippines with our
men-of-war and Gatling guns and drill
the natives full of holes we are follow
ing the desire of God. We are there
for money and markets, and for no
other reason in the world, and Professor
Howison knows it."
The closing remark cf the reverend
gentleman provoked a most heated and
somewhat personal discussion between
Professor Howison and Dr. Voorsanger.
There was a series of explanations, a
renewal of all sorts of good fellowship
and an agreement that the white man's
burden would not again become the
personal concern of those present. In
the argument Mr. Foote remarked that
if any of the gentlemen who seemed to
be bo personally interested found the
white man's burden too heavy on their
side of the table they could transfer it
and its obligations to him.
Whitelaw Reid then made a
few remarks, but discreetly dealt
in generalities that were â¢ not
glittering. His experience as a
diplomat abroad probably made him
discreet. Then there was a call for
George Crocker, but he had gone. It
is not safe to leave Uncle Collis in one
place and the nephew in the other, and
George Crocker is burdened with
enough gold bricks not to take Uncle
Collis at his word. William F. Herrin,

Chinese Turkestan at the
Mercy of the Savage
Salah Mussulmans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 17.â Late
Chinese papers say news comes from
Lanchou. capital of Kansu province,
that the Mohammedan communities to
the north-west of the cityâ known as
the Salah Mussulmans, the most sav
age and bigoted of that faith in the
Chinese dominionsâ have rebelled. The
green sacred banner of the prophet has
been unfurled by their Akhoon or chief
Mullah, and the word passed to all the
Mohammedan townships in Kansu.
Shensi and Chinese Turkestan to wage
war to the knife upon the Buddhist un
believers.
A telegram from Governor Jao of
Chinese Turkestan, whose capital is
Urnmsti. has also been received at Pe
king, reporting considerable unrest
among the Tunganis (Chinese Moham
medans) and Tarantchis in Kuldja and
Turkis in Kashgaria.
A later dispatch from Viceroy Tao of
Kansu has been received at Peking, re
porting the massacre of over thirty
Chinese Buddhists by rebel Salah Mo
hammedans. A general conflagration is
feared with the return of warm weather
in April or May, when communication
becomes easier, unless a strong army
is assembled in Kansu.
The Viceroy complained of the with
drawal to Peking of Generals Tung
Fuchsiang and Chang Chun with their
best troops, whose sanguinary battles
of the past twenty years against the
Mohammedans have made them greatly
feared by the latter, not only in Kansu,
but also in Chinese Turkestan, and that
in consequence the whole northwest is
practically defenseless and at the
mercy of the Mohammedans, if tnej
should unite together and rebel.

forty years "Mack," a3 he was fa
miliarly known to the traveling public,
has driven a public carriage in this city.
;gh at the time of Ills death he had
passed the 78th milestone, until the be
ginning of his recent illness he drove
with all his well-known skill and climbed
on and off the box like a man of 40. Dur
ing his long handling of the reins he had
driven almost every prominent visitor
about the city, and there is little doubt
that he enjoyed a wider acquaintance
than any other man in his profession In
this State.
About a year ago McGeorge was at
tacked by a cancer. He laid aside the
reins for a few months and underwent a
course of treatment that was apparently
successful. Returning again to his old
work, he kept it up with all his old-time
force until a few weeks ago, when a huge
carbuncle appeared upon the back of his
neck. Owing to the condition of his blood
it caused his death.

HONOLULU, April 31, -An important
gTeater-hnrh.ir sc'n. :ne is being quietly
promoted by private enterprise. It is to
make a new harbor of KriMhl Lagoon,
connecting it with the old harbor of
Honolulu by a canal a. .. La half
long and 210 feet wide. There would be
no trouble In making 11 wider afterward
by cutting away more of the reef on the
seaward side. Seven or ei^ht trial bor
ings have been made In I ;' the
proposed channel. Nothing more formid
able for a dredgo to encounter than soft
coral, in strata averaging less than a
fathom, has been discovered. For the
rest the bottom Is compi Bed of clay, mud
and Fand. The borings arc from twenty
to thirty-five f< et In depth and at a dis

ers fully as great an ares as Honolulu
harbor, reveal soundings in places
enough for any ifloat, while the
bottom Is of BOft material easily ex â â -

It is to the land proposition that the
promoters look for their reward. There is
an a- â  rea abutting on
the lagoon. This Is as flat Iliard
table and would be just right for ware
s, lumber yard - and
factories. Besides this land, it is com
puted that 150 acres may be reclaimed
by depositing on the reef the dredglngs
from the canal excavations. M< Bt â¢>Â£ this

PHILOSOPHY OF
LIFE DISCUSSED
Universal Brotherhood's
Work and Aims.
MAN'S DUTY TOWARD MAN
HELPING HAND TO BRIGHTEN
HUMAN EXISTENCE.
Views Expressed by Noted Theoso
phists Before a Vast Gathering
in the Point Loma
Amphitheater.
BY MRS. H. H. S3MLRS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, April 17.â Fully 2000 peo
ple gathered in the amphitheater on the
site of the School for the Revival of <...Â«
Lost Mysteries of Antiquity on Point
Loma on Sunday afternoon to hear ad
dresses by representatives present from
all over the world on -"The Philosophy of
Life." The presence of this large audi
ence, considering the rather inconvenient
means of reaching Point Loma from San
Diego, indicated a strong interest among
the people of San Diego and vicinity in
the work and ideas of the Universal
Brotherhood.
As soon as the meeting was formally
declared open by the permanent chair
man of the congress, Mr. E. Aug. Ner
shelmer, chairman of the- Universal
Brotherhood, read a list of appointees to
the international council, which was soon
to extend throughout the globe, embrac
ing all of the principal nations and many
minor countries. The names of the mem
bers of the national council were then
read. This body is composed of represen
tative Americans In all parts of the |
Union. |
P. M. Pierce, secretary general of the |
Universal Brotherhood, read many greet
ings to the congress by letter, telegram
and cable, which had been received since j
the previous session. These come from :
lodges in Sweden, Holland, Germany,
England, New Zealand, Canada, India
and other countries and from cities In
many States.
The orchestra rendered a splendid mu
sical selection, after which "The Philoso
phy of Life" was taken up by a number >
of speakers. . The scope of the subject ad
mitted of discussion from many points of j
view. It was accordingly treated, but at
the same time a broad unanimity be
tween the speakers was apparent. The.
basic idea of all was the necessity of rec- ;
ognizing brotherhood as a fundamental ,
fact â¢â ! human existence, and the making
of it the rule of action in the life of man
kind. All the great .philosophers were
declared to have been raised up on this
foundation, different systems of thought i
having been evolved in all ages and peo- j
ples as were appropriate to the needs
of the races and the time.
Several speakers maintained the advisa- ;
bility of giving less attention to systems
of philosophy and depending more upon
sound common-sense, regarding such as
the coping stone and purpose of every i
school of philosophy. Differences of opin- j
ion were regarded as unimportant ana ad '
the natural outcome of different condi- '
tions and development of mind, but in !
every case brotherhood as a fact and the
essential wisdom of making it the guid
ing rule were insisted upon.
Mrs. Tingley paid in substance that the great
need of lite now was to recognize and realize
conceptions. The weakness into which man had
drifted left him now without the courage and
strength to battle with the force of adverse |
conditions. In accord with his higher feelings
and aspirations. lie felt that he had not the j
time to work except on the prevailing lines, and j
these led to pain. Buffering and helplessness.
She spoke of the people of Cuba, of their pow- !
erlessness unaided and alone to avail them- :
selves of the opportunity and the new life open- '
Ing to them; what this could be brought to
â with some compassionate aid given with the
touch of common human kindness. She re
ferred to all this as but the fuller expression
of what was prevailing In loss accentuated form
everywhere. When humanity, through the en
couragement of brotherly help and sympathy
and the higher education and deeper under
standing such would bring to pass, came to
know and fill the soul, then would men and
women arise with the power to lead human life ]
Into its rightful heritage. This was the aim |
and purpose of the Universal Brotherhood, and |
already its work was producing results and was
witnessed by the rate at which the organization
was growing, by the presence of that large
assemblage, containing so many who In devo
tion and love to this cause and to promote it
had come from the furthermost parts of the
globe.
The Wagner recital was given Sunday night
by Mrs. â¢ Alice Leighton Cleather and Basil
Crump of London, a noted member of the Lon
don Wagner Society and of the Universal
Brotherhood. The amphitheater was tilled to
overflowing. Splendid stereoptlcon views were
used to bring out and accentuate the vital
teachings of the great philosopher and the es
sential characters of hip most important
dramas. Mrs. Cleather and Mr. Crump when
speaking were practically in the dark, this
being necessary in the use of the stereopttcon,
there being Just enough light to give' a glimpse
of Greek life depicted on the scenery behind,
which was in place for the presentation of the
great play, "Eumenldes," to come a little later.
The darkness added to the lmpressiveness of
the occasion and aided the understanding to
ward better grasping .the real meaning of the
Interpretation given by the lecturers.
Mrs. Cleather and Mr. I'rumn alternately
spoke. in the interval retiring behind the dimly
visible palms, whence the imposing soul-stir
ring music, rendered by them came a3 an in
spiring power to the audience. No one present
could have failed to recognize somewhat of the
grand function of the drama and music in
union will perform for the individual and for
the state when it is rightly understood and
utilized, and to see that such was the hope and
aim to which Wagner devoted the genius and
best energies of hlB life.
Every preparation has been made for the first
presentation of "Eumenides," to occur on
Monday evening. To its production the Wagner
recital forms a fitting prelude. It will demon
strate in fuller measure than the Wagner re
cital the truth of the Ideal and profound con
ceptions to which â¢ Wagner labored to give
birth. .
A special congressional session of Universal
Brotherhood will convene immediately after the
regular one now proceeding will have expired
by limitation. The special session will extend
through threo days to Sunday, April 23. It. is
called because many matters of Importance
have not been reached and additional ones have
arisen which need prompt attention and con
sideration. More time for this is required than
Is left at the disposal of the regular session.
HELD UP AT THE
POINT OF A PISTOL
Advertising Manager Joselyn of the
Emporium Robbed by Footpads
of Money and Trinkets.
W. E. Joslyn. advertising manager of
the Emporium, was waylaid by two foot
pads shortly after midnight Saturday and
at the point of a pistol compelled to surÂ»
render the sum of $62 50 and a number of
trinkets. He reported the robbery to thÂ»
police last night and Detective Silvey Is
searching for the daring criminals.
Mr. Joslyn stated that he was on his
way to his residence at 82S Powell street,
and while climbing the hill between PlnÂ»
and California streets was startled by
two men Jumping out of a dark door
way and ordering him to give up his val

The attack was so sudden that Mr.
Joslyn hud no chance to resist. With a
pistol within an inch of his nose the vic
tim handed over a small sum, but one of
the robbers heard the click of his purse
clasp and compelled him to give it up.
The robbers were scared by some peo
ple passing on California street, and they
ordered Mr. Joslyn to climb the hill. Only
too glad to escape, the latter moved rap
idly up the street, and when he turned
around to see if they were still there he
was warned by one of them to get out of
sight or he would put a bullet through

tall and short. The tall man wore a red
handkerchief on the lower part of his
face and the short man a white one. The
former was attired In a dark suit and

had a long overcoat that reached to his
ankles. Mr. Joslyn thinks he could, identi

STANFORD'S NEW
REGISTER ISSUED
Important Changes Put
Into Effect.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 17.
The first copies of the university reg
ister for 1898-99 made their appearance
to-day. The book, in arrangement and
general appearance, corresponds closely
to the catalogues of previous years. It
will be ready for general distribution
in a few days.
The most important change noted In
the new register is the one regarding
entrance requirements. It is in line
â with the policy being pursued through
out the country in requiring students
to have a more thorough preparation
before entering college than they have
had in the past. Beginning in Septem
ber, 1900, thirteen credits will be re
quired for admission in full standing,
Instead of twelve as at present. With
the commencement of the academic
year 1901, â¢ fifteen credits will be re
quired for regular standing. After 1901
partial standing will require twelve
instead of. ten credits. The change has
been made in the interest of intercol
legiate comity, to facilitate the transfer
of students from one institution to an
other and to bring the requirements of
Stanford into as exact correspondence
as possible with those of the leading
Institutions of the country.
This increase in the entrance credits
required does not mean that prepara
tory students must take up more
studies. It will allow them to pursue
mure advanced work along certain
lines, lor arrangements have been made
in Greek, German and French whereby
extra credits can be obtained.
One effect of the new requirements
upon the high schools will be this: Be
ginnlng with IWI it will be impossible
for any high school to prepare for ad
mlssion in full standing on a three
years' course, it will be possible, how
ever, for graduates of the three years'
course to enter the university in partial
Btandlng. The result of the change will
lie to hasten the transition in the high
Bchoors from the three to the four
years' course without actually compel
ling it.
Under admission on recommendation
the tendency to require something more
than the statement oJ the principal la
ting more marked. It will be
isary to present some satisfactory
evidence of the student's work here
after. In English literature the experi
m< at of giving an oral examination will
be tried. In history the note-book re
quirement goes into effect this year. In
physiology, botany and zoology recom
mendations will be received, provided
they are accompanied, by satisfactory
note books. In French and German,
after 1899, exercise books in French
composition must be submitted.
Among the new courses offered this
year are two In Russian, by Professor
Bablne. Mathematics, for the first time,
is arranged under two separate titles
pure mathematics and applied mathe
matics.
The number of students for the pres
ent year Is larger than for any previous
year of the university except 1897-Os.
There Is a small decrease in the num
ber of graduate students. A greater
falling off Is noticed in the special stu
dents, due to the severe requirements
put into effect this year in raising the
age limit and establishing the require
ment of being able to do advanced work
in some line.
In the faculty list Professor Bran
ner's name appears next In order to
President Jordan's, with his new title
of vice president. Professors Spencer
and Cubberly have been advanced
from assistant to associate professors.
Professors Copeland and Newson have
1 ti added to the list of assistant pro
fessors and Professor Whittier has been
promoted from an Instructor to an as
sistant professor.
Tho now Instructors are Miss Maud
March, Jefferson Elmore, J. H. Howard,
Robert E. Swain, O. L. Lincoln and
â¢Jackson E. Reynolds.
The non-resident lecturers for the
year include Professor Hunt of the
University of the Pacific, Judge Llnd
ley of Ran Francisco and Rabbi Voor
eanger of San Francisco.
The library now contains 42,000 vol
umes and 18,000 pamphlets. The faculty
â consisting of professors, associate and
assistant professors, instructors and
lecturersânumbers 107. Of the 1153 stu
dents 690 are men and 463 are women.
TWO PRINCES COME

head of the educational system in India,
and Lieutenant Nickel of the Montana
troops. .
Prince Kannole is making a tour of the
world for pleasure and observation. He
does not think that all the talk of trouble
In China amounts to anything, but bays
that If China is to be partitioned by the
powers Japan will certainly want a slice
of it. He brings the news that the Japa

dize the two Japanese steamship compa
nies now plying vessels between this
country and the Orient. This means that
six new vessels. will be put on, three to
ply between Japan and San Francisco and
three running to Seattle or Victoria.
Prince Kannoie is not a Prince of the
blood, but worked himself up to his pres
ent position. He is bright and intelligent
and speaks English fluently. â¢
Prince Lichreowski is making a trip
around the world for his health. He Bays

LONDON FLATS
Holocaust Is Narrowly
Averted.
Special Dispatch to Thf< Call.
LONDON, April 17.â The British
metropolis narrowly escaped a calamity
to-day which might have rivaled the
horrors witnessed at tho destruction by
fire recently of the Windsor Hotel in
New York city.
Hyde Park Court, Albertgate, one of
the finest and most fashionable blocks
of residential flats, overlooking the
famous Rotten Row, caught fire this
morning. The building, which is
eleven stories high, was built by the
notorious Jabez Spencer Balfo-ur, the
former member of Parliament, who was
responsible Cor the collapse of the
Liberator Building Association and
other companies, by which thousands o-f
people were ruined ;md who is now
undergoing a sentence of fourteen years
penal servitude as a result of his con
viction on charges of fraud. It prac
tically adjoins the house occupied by
Sir Herbert Naylor-Leyland, Bart.,
Liberal member of Parliament for the
Southport division of Lancanshire,
whose wife was Miss Annie Chamber
lain of Cleveland, O.
The fire-broke out in the lower part of
the building and spread up the elevator
shaft with great rapidity. The flames
Involved the upper stories before their
occupants were aware of the danger.
When the alarm was raised the af
frighted servants dropped from the top
windows to a veranda on the ninth
story. The defective arrangements of
the London fire brigade were again
demonstrated and even when the fire
escapes reached the scene they were
too short to reach the people in the up
per stories, wtio only escaped with the
greatest difficulty,, while the residents
of the lower stories streamed out of the
building, carrying what they could of
their belongings.
The flames were not under control
until 1 o'clock, when the upper part of
the structure was gutted.
It is considered lucky that the fire
occurred in daylight, as otherwise it
would have resulted in loss of life. All
the floors were supposed to be fire
proof.
The investigation into the cause of
the lire shows it to have been due to
the overheating of an electric wire.
Several of the occupants of the build
ing escaped in their nightclothes.
A whole army of tlremen, under Com
mander Wells, was engaged in subdu
ing the flames. During the conflagra
tion the Windows of the French Em
bassy, which overlooked tho scene,
werÂ»; crowded, and an Immense mn
eourso of people watched the fire from
the streets. The property destroyed in
cluded a quantity of jewelry.

Owners of Creek Property Find That
Their Jurisdiction Extends but

Surface.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
T A COMA, April 17.â News comes
from Dawson that Dr. Willis E. Ever
ett, the well-known Tacoma mineralo
gist and assayer, has discovered that
bedrock at the bottom of the Klondike
placers is indented with seams contain
ing gold, which makes the bedrock
work $5000 and upward a ton. It is
reported Dr. Everett and a number of
other mining men have located the
bedrock of a number of the richest
placer mines as quartz claims. Placer
miners are greatly displeased at this
turn of affairs and claim Dr. Everett
has no right to obtain mines in thi^
manner. The matter has been referred
to the Gold Commissioner for a deci
sion.
Never in the history of placer min
ing in Alaska has any attention been
paid to bedrock. The gravel for a few
feet above it was always rich, and from
it most of the gold that has come from
Alaskan districts has been taken. The
miners have never gone any deeper,
nor did they think to have it assayed.
Sulphur Creek bedrock has proved the
richest around Dawson and many
quartz locations have been posted at
the bottom of the placer shafts along
the creek bed since Dr. Everett made
his discovery. As soon as the discovery
was announced there was a stampede
to Sulphur Creek, and now bedrock un
der placer claims is all located, from
claim 65 to 20 below. Dr. Everett is
reported as having said that the rock
will go as high as $10,000 in gold.
To prove that the gold is not the free
placer g"ld of the surface gravels,
which has been worked down into the
interstices of the bedrock, the sulphides
from ten square feet of ro<-k taken
from ten different places were care
fully washed six times. Then the sul

phides were subjected to the furnaces
and yielded $1500 to the ton which
means about $20 to the ton of bedrock
removed and simply washed The
question arisies: Does mineral-bearing
bedrock in place belong to the placer
claim above, or. is it subject to quartz
location by some one else?
Time will prove or disprove the
value of the discovery, but the ques
tion as to whether the new quartz lo
cators or placer men own the BearocK
may prove an unpleasant one to handle.
Hitherto placer men have been in the
habit of taking up a foot or more or
the bedrock for the free gold it con
tained. This, the quartz men say,
cannot be done, as the rock is in place
and is a schist containing gold of it
self. A simple way out of the dilemma
for the placer men is to locate their
own bedrock where they find it worth
working, as the cost of location is only
$5. and drifting in the gravel will an
swer as a representation of work. The
claims are perfectly safe from outsid
ers, for unless they really get to bed
rock they cannot locate it.
Dr. Everett created surprise last
summer by announcing that he naa
succeeded in transmuting silver Into
gold. His gold button was misem
scopical in size and he made no claim
that his method of transmutation P"?

fall Dr. Everett went to Dawson to re
main two- years in the interest of New
York and London men.

hut near Shasta last night. Ah Toy had
lived in that one spot for upward of
twenty-five years. The hair on his head

PARIS, April 17.â Figaro, con
tinuing its publication of testimony of
fered before the Court of Cassation in
the Dreyfus revision proceedings, gives
another installment of Colonel Pic
quart's evidence.
Colonel Picquart denied that he had
expended 100,000 francs in his inquiries
concerning Commandant Esterhazy.
On th contrary, he said, his expenses
tinder this head were very small. When
the Eclair, in September, 1896, publish
ed an article lirst mentioning that
secret documents had been communi
cated to the court-martial, Picquart
supposed it was a maneuver of the
Dreyfus family to get the trial an
nulled, and he endeavored, though
vainly, to ascertain the author of the
Eclairs article.
From the time when he mentioned his
suspicions regarding Esterhazy to Gen
erela Gonze, Picquart felt, he testified,
a disguised hostility c-n the part of
Gonze toward himself. He referred, in
this connection, to the ignoring by Gen
trals Gonze, Billot and De Boisdeffre
of his proposals that measures be em
ployed regarding Esterhazy.

On another occasion, General Billot,

yuilt of Dreyfus, Colonel Plcquart ex

Special Dlsratch to The Coll.
CHICAGO, April 17.â The long-ex
pected ha? at last happened and writ
ers of funny paragraphers the world
over have been vindicated. The Chi
] ;iver took fire to-night and
burned fiercely for an hour.
Shortly before midnight a passenger
on a Northwestern suburban train,
while crossing the river at Kinzie street
just outside the Btatlon, carelessly
threw a burning match out of the win
after lighting a cigar. The river a
moment later was a sheet of flnme for
a distance of two or three blocks. The
clocks took lire, ;:s did the abutments
and wood work of the bridge.
In the bridge house were several bar
of oil used by the tender for his
signal lamps. They took fixe, exploded
and added their burning contents to the
already Haming mass below. A sewer
empties into the river at this point. A
large volume of gas poured out of thi:
and it, too, became ignited. All the
boats on the rivev and all engines In thÂ«
district were hurried to the scene to
save the docks, warehouses and eleva
tors in the vicinity. All the vessels in
the creek at that point were hurried un- j
der their own steam or by tugs Into the ;
south branch to avoid destruction.

point where the. fire was set by a slight
tide till its volume was sufficiently
great to catch the name of the burning
match Inadvertently dropped Into it.
ORCHESTRA REFUSES
TO RENDER "DIXIE"
Theodore Thomas' Aggregation Al-
most Causes a Riot in an
Atlanta Opera House.
; ATLANTA; April 17. Theodore Thomas 1
j â with his great orchestra made his tirst
| professional visit to Atlanta to-night and
â  almost provoked a riot by his first pro
j fessional, or unprofessional, act. The peo
| pie of the South love "Dixie," a;: . had
! made up their minds to hear their favor
ite rendered by Thomas' famous aggre-
I gation. They crowded the Grand Opera
! house to the doors. During the day nu
j merous '"requests" were made to play
i "Pixie" as a sort of overture. In fact it
! had been announced in the papers that it j
would be played. A committee called on ;
Mr. Thomas after the overture and re- j
newed the request that "Dixie" lie played. â¢
Ho â :-â ' A noisy element in the au- I
dienco kept up a (ire of requests during
every intermission until Mr. Thomas was j
forced to announce that he couldn't play j
the tune demanded, giving as a reason j
that a high class orchestra such as his
could not afford to waste time with low
class music.
This announcement was followed by an
uproar of disapproval, which threatened
to become a riot, but the famous con-: j
ductor was obdurate and the crowd went I
home without having heard "Dixie." There
is some apprehension to-night as to what
effect Thomas' explanation will have on
the attendance at the remaining three i
concerts to be given.

time in the dense underbrush, and, when finally discovered, was car- 1
rled nearly a mile upon the back of his brother and then a long distance
further on horseback to the ranch house. He was bleeding and suf
fering tortures on the trip, and he finally died before medical aid could
be summoned.
Just how the accident occurred â will never be known. The unfor
tunate lad did not regain consciousness enough to speak and it is sup
posed there were no eye-witnesses to the affair. A. Castro, the brother
of the boy and the one who found him, said they were hunting, each
carried Winchesters. The country was very rugged. Tiny became
separated, one on either side nf a canyon. The elder brother heard two
reports ol a rifle and then a cry for help. He hastened in the direction

Supervisor of the Second District of Cala

knowing all and saying nothing,
mixed with a benignity of compla
cency and shrewdness, which in a
second relapsed into his ordinary
countenance.
"Is it true that the policy of the
Italian Government has been such as
to exclude the Vatican from direct
representation at the approaching
peace conference?"
Cardinal Rampolla affirmed that it
unfortunately was so.
"And the French delegates, will
not they really represent the Vatican
and so declare at the conferenceP"
The Cardinal again assumed an
enigmatical expression. "That is
quelque a part, and you must excuse
me if I cannot give you more positive
information upon that point."
The idea, however, was evidently
pleasing- to him, and it obtains cred
ence in Roman politics. Moreover, it
is probable. The near departure of
Monsignor Tarnassi, Papal Inter-,
nuncio at The Hague, for a visit to
Rome gives color to the belief.

Sir Andrew urges a thorough under

his opinion, should first discover Agui

these Into agencies of trade for the set

show the natives that this would be a
better outlet for capital and they
would thus be depriving the enemy of
the sinews of war. After that, he con

"Underlying everything," says Sir
Andrew, "must be the good will of the

AN EXTRA SESSION OF
CONGRESS MAY BE CALLED
It Is Said to Be the Intention of the
President to Summon the Na
tional Lawmakers.
NEW YORK. April 17.â A Washington
special to the Journal says: Visitors to
President McKlnley say he has under se
rious consideration the calling of an ex
tra session of the Pity-sixth Congress.
Recent callers at the White House have
been asked so many questions as to what
would be tlie effect politically of such a
movement that they are convinced it Is
the i'li sent intention to convene Con
gress in extraordinary session, probably
on September 1, and certainly not later
than October 1.
Three matters of more than ordinary
importance demand early action, and
they will form the basis for the calling of
an extra session. They are the currency
question, the Philippine question and our
new colonies.

Attempts Suicide by Cutting
His Throat.
TULARE, April 17.â Judge W. J. Rob

by cutting his throat with a razor. He
was found lying on the floor of the kitch

household. Medical aid was called in and
his life saved.
Robertson has been in ill health for
several months with little prospect of a

refused a nomination to succeed himself.
QUAY'S CASE TO
REACH THE JURY
But Some Rulings Favor
the Defense.
EVIDENCE IS SHUT OUT
BUT AN EXPERT PERMITTED TO
REFRESH HIS MEMORY.
One Decision by Judge Biddle, the
Ex-Senator's Attorneys Claim,
Practically Rules Out Figures
Prior to November, 1896.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, April 17.â Meyer
Goldsmith, the commonwealth's ac
countant, was on the stand all day in
the trial of Senator Qvay, making
statements of facts that are apparently
damaging to the defendant's side of the
case. Goldsmith is the main witness
for the presecution and it is through
him that all of the documentary evi
dence is to be presented. This wit
ness has examined the bank's books
thoroughly, and he came into court
this morning with a number of type
written sheets containing figures that
he gathered from the various books, re
lating mainly to the deposit of the
State Treasurer and the account of
Senator Quay. He swore to the cor
rectness of his work and then the Dis
trict Attorney formally offered the pa
per in" evidence.
This was objected to by the defense on
the ground that such a paper is not testi
mony. It was insisted that the books
themselves should be placed before the
witness and his statements uttered from
what he saw entered .n them. The Judge
decided in favor of the defense, thus giv
ing that side the first comfort it has ex
perienced sine,, the trial began. The de
fense has apparently gained this point.
The paper was practically in evidence,
Witness Goldsmith using it? contents in
framing his answers to the District Attor
ney's questions. When the Quay lawyers
objected to this they were met by the
Judges ruling that while the paper could
not be used as sworn evidence the wit
ness might use it to refresh his memory.
One effect of all this was to make it
certain that the case will now go to the
jury, there having b^tn some doubt on
this point up to the decision to admit all
that Goldsmith might have to say.
Just before the close of the day's pro
ceedings there was another ruling by
Judge Biddle in favor of the defense which
may have an important bearing on the
futuiv of the case. The statute of limita
tions has been pleaded time and again
by Senator Quay's lawyers as a baj to
much of the testimony presented Ujr the
commonwealth. As Mr. Quay wai Indict
ed on November 17. 1898, the two years al
lowed by the statute for prosecution
would extend hack only to November 17
1896. On this basis Mr. Watson has fre
quently urged Judge Kiddle to exclude
mention of transactions dating back to
1886, when Mr. Quay was State Treasurer.
The court lias uniformly held, in effect,
that the statute of limitations does not
affect the evidence, but does affect the
crime.
The District Attorney pointed out that
he alleges the defendant's guilt during the
two years the law confines him to, and to
prove this the corroborative evidence of
the previous years should certainly be ad
mitted. Judge Blddle decided against the
commonwealth and the Quay lawyers
were very happy. He ruled that the evi
dence should be confined to the conspiracy
alleged and not relate to some other con
spiracy.
It is interesting to note that there was
every indication that the Judge was in
clined to rule against Mr. Quay when
Mr. Watson, who has a suave, persuasive
style, got into another little speech, simi
lar to several he had made during the
day, and begged the court to consider the
promt that the prosecution had so far I
failed to show a specific conspiracy and
that this should be done before it went ;
Into the general question of conspiracy. j
The Judge took this view and ruled ac
cordingly. The lawyers for the defense
claimed that the decision practically rules
out the figures prior to November 17
1896. Mr. Rothermel says its effect will :
be to prevent him from introducing much !
of the evidence he hoped to present.
REPORTS ON THE QUAY
BRIBERY CHARGES
HARRISBURG, Pa., April 17.â Majority
and minority reports wire presented to I
the House this evening from the commit
tee which has for several weeks pa.st been j
investigating the charges of attempted
bribery in connection with the balloting j
for United States Senator and tho con- !
sideration in the House of the McCarreU
.iurv bill. The latter bill, which was I
eventually defeated, was said to have |
introduced to aid Senator Quay in
his then approaching trial in the Philadel
phia courts. The majority report recites
at considerable length the testimony :
taJten by the committee, and says the :
evidence disclosed clearly that undue ;
means were taken by many persons to '
corruptly solicit members of the House I
both for the purpose of influencing their
official action in reference to the McCar
rell jury bill and in reference to their I
official action as to the election of a
United States Senator.
The majority report concludes: "In con
clusion your committee reports that there
is in their opinion sufficient evidence
against Charles B. Spatz, John R. Byrne,
Parker Titus, Frank B. Jones, Monroe H.
Kulp, Thomas B. Moyles, Robert Evans,
John J. Coyle and M. J. Costello for this
House to direct that criminal proceedings
lie brought against them in the Court of
Quarter Sessions at Dauphin County, and
it is recommended that these proceedings
be immediately commenced and vigorous
ly prosecuted by the authority of this
House." _______^^__
MEMORIAL ARCH AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
Benefactress of the Institution Signs
a Contract for a Magnificent
Structure.
SAN JOSE, April 17.â A contract for the
erection of a memorial arch at the Le
land Stanford Jr. University was filed
to-day with the County Recorder. The
McGilvray Stone Company of San Fran
cisco isÂ»"the builder and in the contract
signed by Mrs. Jane L. Stanford the price
is given as $67,856.
The arch will be an imposing one. It
will be built of sandstone nnd trimmings
as used throughout the structures about
the oampiiH. The plans were drawn by
Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge of Boston and
later revised by C. E. Hodges, the resi
dent architect of the university. â¢ It will
be % feet high and sr> feet wide. The
driveway will have a height of ">1 feet and
a width of 43 feet. On each side will be
passageways through smaller arches for
pedestrians. Stairways will run to the
top and there will be four floors, on each
(if which will be rooms. Tho structure
will be lighted by electricity. It is to be
completed by November 1, 1899,
FAVOBS ANNEXATION.
North Pasadena Would Rid Itself of
Numerous Saloons.
PASADENA, April 17.â Beer and whisky
have become live factors in a movement
for a Greater Pasadena and the annexa
tion of North Pasadena suburb. Water
has long been a factor, but it was never
suspected that the stronger liquids could
be whipped into line. It is thought the
city limits should embrace, as far as pos
sible, those of the water plant, so that no
hardship might be worked upon citizens
by making them bear the expense of out
side consumers of water. But this was
not sufficient incentive for North Pasa
der.ans to support the movement. They
have not believed the ad-vantages would
be as great as the disadvantages.
Now they have changed their minds.
The closing of the "blind pigs" here has
driven the ilk-gal liquor shops to North
Pasadena. The North Pasadenans are
beginning U think that after all annexa
tion and the abolition of the liquor traffic
might be a good thing.
CHECKS IN EVIDENCE.

WILLOWS, April 17.â When the Mur

checks signed by William Murodck. This
monotonous reading of checks was com
cluded when court adjourned this after
noon. The defense will call Theodore
Kytka, a handwriting expert, for its first
witness to-morrow morning. Kytka has
been taking photographs of William Mur
dock's signatures for the past week.
Puget Sound Oysters in Demand.
TACOMA, April 17. -Edward R. Wag
ner of New York is here investigating the
opportunities offered for the shipment of
Pugret Sound Oysters to New York in re
frigerator cars. Mr. Warner was for
merly a Holland oysterman and supplied
the larger cities of Europe. He says the
flavor of Puget Sound oysters more nearly
resembles that of the European oyster
than does any other produced in thig
country. If his plans carry he will select
the largest Sound oysters for shipment
direct to New York and distribution
thence among the larger cities of the At

BUSILY ENGAGED.
Should They Succeed in Gaining

Once Convened.
SrectaJ DlFpatch to Tha Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 17.â The sud
den and unannounced departure of
Governor Henry T. (Jnprp for the north
does not please the Republican wing of
his adherents. They are at a loss for
it motive for the air of mystery with
which he surrounded his movements.
They declnr" that a respectful hearing
â was not granted and that he studiously
"turned them down" by publicly an
nouncing that he would leave for Sac
ramento upon a given date and then
tins upon a different day.
Whether the policy pursued by his Ex
:.cy has caused the political air,
through pique on the part of the
satisfied, to become surcharged with
The rumors of a virulent character that
are abroad to-day, is difficult to deter
mine.
Whatever a diagnosis mijrht reveal,
the fart Is apparent that Governor
does not own the entire Repub
lican party of his home town. It is
asserted that Dan Burns, when he
visited the Gage-Denis go-Id mine at
Acton, was booked to extend his visit to
Los Angeles, but suggestions of a
peremptory nature came from a certain
Republican quarter that the mining of
a defeated Senatorial aspirant would be
hazardous and extremely distasteful.
c the sudden return to the north
ms, although it had been arranged
for I'olonel Dan to take a much-needed
rest and a well-earned vacation in the
salubrious climate of the Southland.
To-day politicians who handle the ques
tion as a business said that trusted
lieutenants of Burns had been in this
vicinity essaying to tie up Senatorial
Assembly timber to the Burns
extra-session craft, and, further, that
< .-nsiderable favorable progress was
made.
The argument in behalf of the Burns
Interest is enticing, not to say unique.
"While it is contended that the State
â¢ltution does not permit the Gov
ernor to caJl an extra Bession of the
Legislature except for most Berious rea
sons, this very point is taken as a
for gaining adherents. With only
tigress from Califor
ni, the Burns men allege, possible
Democratic Buccess two years hence
would mean, possibly, two Democratic
;.irs. They are beating the bushes
Lin sufficient strength to elect
Burns. Having secured this, knowing
assert. Gape will call an extra ses
alleging that grave
exists t"T such a course. The claim Is
boldly made that an extra session will
continue when callf-d until Burns Is
elected to the United States Senate.
BIDS FOR MASONRY WORK

It has been pretty definitely decided that
the Postoffice building will be constructed

HAWAII ABOLISHES ITS
CONTRACT LABOR LAW
HONOLULU, April 11.â Just previous
to the departure of the Coptic It is
learned that the Hawaiian Government
has decided tn abolish the contract labor
law. Tho action will be takon to-morrow
morning at a special meeting. It Is un
derstood word came from Washington
to do away with the law, for it is not
reasonable to suppose that President
Dole would nullify a law without the con
sent of President McKinley.
The Immediate cause of the nullifi
cation of the contract labor law Is. the
fact that such a large number of plan
tations have been started within the
past two months. It would require at
least 10,000 additional Japanese for the
new enterprise. This number with the
men already here would practically
Hood the country. President McKinley
has evidently decided to put a stop to
the wholesale Importation of Japanese
coolies.

RICHARD CROKER
ENRAGED BY THE
POINTED QUESTIONS
He Hurls Defiance at Examiner
Moss and Contempt Pro=
ceedings Will Be Carried
to the Legislature.
NEW YORK, April IT.â Tn the session of j
the Mazet legislative Investigating com
mittee to-day Richard Croker was again
the principal object of Mr. Moss' exam
ination and the most important develop
ment was the probability that the Tam
many chieftain and John P. Carroll will
be the subjects of contempt proceedings
re the State Legislature shall ad
journ.
An adjournment of the committee was
taken this afternoon until next Friday
morning and Mr. Croker was subpenaed
to reappear before the session on next
Monday morning. By the initiative of
many of those questions Mr. Croker
i repeatedly refused to answer and with
I whom he had several sallies that came
Dear being personal, the chairman of the
i committee took such action as would
Mr. Croker In technical contempt.
| It was stated to-night that when Mr. Fal
lows of the committee left this evening
; for Albany he had instructions to prepare
1 papers adjudging Mr. Croker and John
I Carroll in contempt.
When tfce committee began its inquiry
this morning about tVie first thing brought
up was a resort known as the "Broadway
Garden," which had flourished in the up
per Broadway district for some time. In
this place the alleged robbery of former
Mayor of Trenton, Frank McGowan, took
place. Simon Burner, the former proprie
tor of the garden, made some startling
charges against l'olice Captain Price, and
hia waiters corroborated in part his testi
mony.
Assemblyman Hoffman offered a resolu
tion to have certain prominent men sum
moned before the committee because ol
a rumor that a certain law firm "by and
with the assistance of other persons, by
corrupt methods, secured the passage
through the Assembly" of the Astoria
gas franchise, whose real purpose "was
to enable the Consolidated Gus Company
to force a consolidation of all the gas in
terests in the city, to the end that the
supply of gas might be controlled and
the prices regulated by the so-called con
solidation."
Mr. Hoffman wanted to subpena the
law firm of Tracy, Boardman & Platt;
Klihu Root, the lncorporator of the Asto
ria Heat, Light and Power Company;
Thomas C. Platt, Benjamin B. O'Dell,
Lemuel Ely Quigg and John D. Crimmins.
The resolution was defeated, however,
live Republicans opposing it and two
Democrats favoring it.
Kichard Croker was called. Mr. Moss asked
him about the contributions made by the
Judicial candidates last year. Croker could not
tell the amount. The Tammany leader and
Moss had a little tilt as to whether Croker
laid that the city was not "wide open."
Croker hnd never heard that the Metropolitan
Railway, or persons Interested In it,
had contributed $75,000 to Tammany Hall dur
lns the lus-t election. Croker had' received no
money, direct or Indirect, from Mr. Carroll
during the last year. Krom Andrew Freed
man. he. or lather his firm. Meyer & Croker,
had received money. Croker said he was Inter
-n-lth Freedman In the United States
Fidelity Company.
"You know that all thÂ» bonded officers of
the city government take out their tninds from
your company?" inquired M
"Not all of them." said the witness. "Some
take them out from your boss' company."
This caused loud laughter.
"Do you mean Mr. Platt' b company T'
asked Moss.

mean." and there was more laughter.
Croker presumed his own company had the
RAILS FROM SAN
JOSE TO ALVISO
Electric Line to Connect
the Two Places.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 17.â A number of
capitalists of this city have associated
themselves together for the building of
an electric railroad between this city
and Alviso. At their head is ex-Super
visor A. Greeninger. The Board of
Supervisors was to-day petitioned for a
franchise for the road from the north
erly city limits straight out First street
to Alviso. The distance is about eight
miles and it is estimated the railway
could be built, equipped and put into
operation at a cost of from $50,000 to
$75,000. It is proposed to carry freight
on the road.
The hearing of the petition was set
for April 8. The question of the right
of the board to grant a franchise for a
freight-carrying road was referred to
the District Attorney. Should the fran
chise be granted, which is most likely,
a company capitalized at $100,000 will be
immediately organized and the work
rushed.
Now that Congress has appropriated
$48,000 for the deepening and widening
of Alviso Rlough the place promises to
be of importance to San Jose. Already
rights-of-way have been obtained for
a steam railway between Alviso and
this place, for which all the track ma
terials are now stored at Alviso. The
steamers from Alvisn to San Francisco
handle a good amount of freight and
passenger traffic, and a railway should
prove a paying venture from the start.

owned any Ktock in the Flushing Gas Com
pany.
Moss wanted to know why he made definite
answers to these personal questions, and Mr.
Croker said: "I don't know, I have to
answer some, and must reserve some to my
judgment. If I did not answer some I would
sit here without answering anything at all."
He had no stock in the New Amsterdam Com
pany, though he once had, long before the
introduction of the Astoria business. He parted
with it at least ten days before the vote was
taken on the Astoria bill. He had parted with
it because he did not wish to get mixed up in
rtiat business. He had only held it on a mar
gin.
â You were $7000 Ehort on Manhattan?" said
Mobs, repeating a question that on Saturday
Croker had utterly refused to answer.
"I was not," answered Croker. "That never
happened at all. If you had acted as a gentle
man, au you are now at this point, the other
day, I would have told you."
Croker refused to admit that the Democratic
opposition to the passage of the Astoria gas
Mil was by reason of the fact that he and his
friends and the members of the Democratic
organization held stock in the New Amsterdam
Company, which was a rival company.
Moss asked Croker again if he had given his
son Frank $17,000 with which to buy stock in
the Roebling: Construction Company. Cruker
declined to answer.
Chairman Mazet instructed him to answer,
and he refused. The same thing occurred when
Moes asked him how much stock of the Auto-
Truck Company Croker held, and how much
he paid for his interest in that concern.
Croker nald he thoueht the city would be
much better without a civil service law.
When Mobs said that Cruker had found that
so in business matters like that of Peter Meyer
& Co., members of the organization could help
each other. Croker said angrily: "You are
trying to make us out a pack of thieves in one
combination."
"And you think these questions Indicate that
persons who do these things are thieves?"
queried Moes.
"That la what you are trying to get at," said
Croker, thoroughly aroused. "I say that the
people of the city of New York, when they
for our ticket, voted to put in the organ
ization, and believe that the organization
: run this city. And when you were put
out of the Police Board that was what you
were rut out for, because you were not an
organization man."
After further exchange of sharp words,
Croker becoming greatly enraged, Mnss re
marked that It was that Croker realized the
"seriousness of the occasion. "
The Tammany leader retorted: "Not very
Berloua. I am not going away. I am going to
stay here until th-> cirrus is over."
"You are not going l " Europe?" paid Moss.
"I am going to be here to see bow long you
are iri^ to stay; you can have me any day
you want," replied the wiinÂ»'^?.
Croker declared he had never said he would
never resign from the leadership of Tammany
Unll. He- had merely stated that he would r.'
maln In Tammany Hall as long as he lived.
He *aH there were no Inducementi in the way
Ferences offered to join Tammany Hall.
He denied that he waa "broke" when he re
turned from England.

had been passive, made a wonderful ad
vance, compared with previous years. The
lady devoted a great deal of her time to

the social members. ., One new lodge was
Instituted, one was consolidated and one
surrendered its charter. The membership
is at this time distributed in seventeen

will be the only candidate for protector.

has yet been named. A. Gompertz, at
present one of the trustees, will be nom
inated for treasurer. H. W. Quitzow will

be any contest for any of the of
fices except that of supreme represen
tative, there being two to be elected.
The candidate? are Mrs. Wheelock,
whose friends say she is entitled to a
unanimous election on account of her
work during the past year. The others
who are named for the office are James

Child, Accused of Steal
ing a Watch From a
Neighbor's House.
LIZZIE SEABOLL, a pretty girl 10
years of age, living at 235 Perry

petty larceny. She Is accused of
stealing a gold watch valued at $20
from Mamie Mangan, a girl 15 years
of age living: at 229% Perry street.
The warrant was obtained in Judge

ag-ainst the little girl is that of a 2
year-old boy, Tommy Mangan, a
brother of the complaining witness.
Mamio Mangan and her mother called
at the office of the Chief of Police yes
terday morning and made a complaint
against Lizzie for stealing the watch,
and they were advised to swear out a
warrant for her arrest.
Lizzie was detained in the City Pris
on from noon till 4 o'clock in
the afternoon, when her father
saw Judge Mogan and the
Judge released her on her own recog
nizance. She denies emphatically the
charge of stealing the watch, and the
Judge was impressed with her story.
"My mother sent me last Wednes
day," she said, "to Mrs. Mangan' a to
borrow the newspaper. While Mamio
and I were talking in the bedroom

along the street, came in and wanted

GRAND COUNCIL ROYAL
AND SELECT MASONS
PATRIOTIC REVIEW OF EVENTS
OF THE PAST YEAR.
The Grand Council of Royal and Select
Master Masons of California met yesterday
in thirty-eighth annual session in the Ma
sonic Temple with Grand Master Robert
Ash and all the grand officers at their re
spective stations. There were forty dele
gates present.
The reports of the grand officers that
were submitted showed that the council
is In good condition, numerically and
financially, and that during the year there
was the average Increase in membership.
Aside from the presentation of these re
ports only routine business was trans
acted.
Grand Master Ash in his report made
allusion to the events of the past year,
calling attention to the assassination of
the American sailors on the Maine, the
declaration of war and Its welcome by
the whole people, not in a spirit of re
venge, but in the cause of liberty and hu
manity, and then he said:
The conflict was brief and the American
arms won new victories upon land and sea.
Pome of our companions were the first to draw
the sword and the first to Droclatm the
tidings of victory. Admiral Dewey, our il
lustrious countryman, one of the brightest and
bravest men that wears the stars, less than
<me year ago planted the standard of civiliza
tion and humanity on the Islands of the East
ern sea tn the midst of a victory â the grand
est that history has ever recorded. Soon after

MRS. CLARK MAKES AN ASSAULT
ON HER HUSBAND'S DEFENDERS
Introduction of Her Dead Baby's Shoe in Evidence Causes the
Exciting Scene*
THE trial of Joseph Clark for the killing of Fireman Joseph P. Gross in November last has produced several
dramatic Incidents since its opening, but its only sensation was concentrated into the space of a few minutes
yesterday morning. ' -'.*- i,
Mrs. Clark, whose bitterness toward her accused husband and obvious endeavors to assist the prosecution
ha caused considerable unfavorable comment, seeing in an exhibitâ tiny shoe that once covered her dead
baby's chubby footâ development of a contention favorable to the defendant, made a wild endeavor to pre
vent its introduction in evidence. When the tiny shoe was drawn from its wrappings by Louis P. Boardman, of the
counsel for the defense, Mrs. Clark sprang from her seat beside the District Attorney, sailed toward Mr. Boardman
and H. Digby Johnston, grasped the shoe and shouting, "That's my baby's shoe and you shan't have It here," aimed
a vicious blow at Johnston's head with her left. Johnston ducked with great speed, and the woman's right fist
came toward Boardman's head. Boardman blocked the blow successfully arid was scrambling to get to his feet to bet
ter defend himself when District Attorney Murphy, recovering from his temporary paralysis, superinduced by the
sudden assault on opposing counsel, grasped the frenzied woman by the coat tail and in obedience to a hurried order of
the court assisted the bailiff in depositing her outside the limits of the court room.
The facts which caused the) assault are not without pathetic interest. Clark was put on the stand at the open
ing of the morning session to tell his story of the circumstances leading up to and immediately surrounding the
killing. Evidence had been Introduced to prove that since the death, of his baby girl some years ago his mind was
not normal, and while Clark was on the stand the shoe his dead baby wore was produced that he might testify re
garding it. It was found in one of his bureau drawers after the commission of the crfme. It was wrapped first In a
Bilk handkerchief, then a paper covering, and over all a large towel was tied. On being unwrapped. a bit of verse,
written by the accused, was found tucked between the laces. It reads:
LITTLR JOPIE.
Oh, tiny feet that would not rest.
Oh, dear head pillowed on our breast.
what would we Rive to hold again
The form we lost, 'mid, tears and pain. . Ili^iliilp
Oh. child! the empty cot Is ours.
But thine the sunshine and the flowers.
The shoe and bit of verse were about to be placed in evidence when the woman made the assault. The reason is
apparently plain. That shoe and bit of verse proved the affection Clark held for his family. It. proved that when
he lost his baby sorrow weakened his mind and strengthened the theory of the defense that, when Gross went
Into his home and alienated his wife's affections it was too bitter a blow and culminated in the slaying of the man
that wrecked his home. .. â¢â¢â ,.-â¢ .
Clark in his story went over the details of the shooting. He said that when he fired the fatal shot he was
fearful that Gross was about to make an attempt upon his life, as the 'dead man reached . for his pocket In a
threatening manner. He further told the story regarding the occasion upon which his son was injured and he re-'
ceived a message to that effect. When he reached the house into which the young man had been carried Gross
was there and informed him that his presence was not required. A battle of fists followed and Gross threw the
witness on the floor and was strangling him when they were separated. That Gross was the defendant's bitter en
emy there is no doubt, the reason for which, it has developed, being the relationship existing between Gross* and the
defendant's wife. .iV" .
The testimony of the defendant was largely corroborated by Dr. Green, especially that portion relating to the
assault made upon Clark by the dead man before referred to. After the cross-examination of Clark the case of the
defense rested. Several witnesses on rebuttal were put on the stand by the prosecution and the case had not closed
when the hour for adjournment came. It will close this morning, however, the argument will be made and it is
thought that a verdict will be reached late In the day. >. ? ;i

GOV. GAGE IS
ON DUTY AT
SACRAMENTO
Has Conference With
Burns on Arrival.
READYTO DISTRIBUTE OFFICES
W. F. FITZGERALD FOR ADJU
TANT GENERAL.
Politicians Are Wondering as to
What Degree of Dan Burns' Dic
tation the Executive
Will Submit.
Governor Gage, refreshed hy a season of
rest, left Los Angeles last Saturday pypn
lnp: on the "Owl" for Sacramento. He ar
rived at the Capitol in due time, whore
he was welcomed by Colonel Burns, while
other disciples of the "push" were wait
ing in the court of the Palace Hotel in
this city to get a glimpse of the State's
executive officer. Some of the malaria
which the Governor took away from Sac
ramento remained with him throughout
his vacation and made his return journey
slightly feverish.
It Is no secret that Gage now intends to
make several appointments, and In conse
quence of this decision on his part there
is some joy in the ranks of the expectant.
When the appointments are announced
there will be wailings of distress, because
thero are at. least ten applicants for
SVi ry desirable position within the gift
of the patronage, distributor. While the
one fortunate recipient will sing the
praises of Gage the other nine will con
signe him to the hottest part of Hades.
The Governor expects that there will be
many disappointments and is prepared to
meet the storm of indignation sure to
follow.
The presence of Burns in Sacramento
when Gage arrived there and the long
private conference that took place after
the executive arrived confirm the suspi
cion that Burns is seeking to dictate the
appointments, and the politicians are
wondering how much dictation Gage will
submit to. Markham stood a good deal
more of Burns than was good for Mark
ham and a vast deal more than was good
for the Republican party of the State of
California. Gage has repeatedly said that
he would allow no one to dictate his ap
pointments and that none of the patron
age at his disposal would be used trf
reward a member of the Legislature for
supporting any candidate for Vnited
States Senator. At Sacramento during
the recent Senatorial contest every legis
lator in the Burns corral, from Dibble to
Cosper, contended that the State patron
age was held in reserve for the followers
of Burns. It is not surprising therefore
that many are anxiously waiting to see
what kind of men Gage appoints to office.
The office of adjutant general, now
filled by General Peeler, does not belong
to the party in the sense that offices are
usually classed. The position is that of
tho Governor's chief of staff, and he will
name some one agreeable to himself. The
executive committee of the Republican
State Central Committee did practically
indorse Colonel George Stone for adjutant
general, and the latter submitted to the
Governor high indorsements from other
sources. Colonel Smedberg and Colonel
CtUTief have very high testimonials re
garding their respective qualifications for
the place. Colonel Seamans of Los An
geles, commander-in-chief of the Re
publican Army and Navy League of Cal
ifornia, is also commended in a fine man
ner. The Governor may not find in this
excellent military material just the man
that suits him, and hence the friendly ad
vices of Colonel Burns may be solicited.
The Governor entertains high regard for
the legal ability of ex-Attorney General
Fitzgerald, and as a knowledge of the
law is useful in the adjutant general's of
fice, Fitzgerald may he selected. The wars
of the National Guard are more likely to
be settled in the courts than on the field
of bloody strife. It happens that Fitz
gerald has had experience In both fields.
He hails from Mississippi, and bears a
good record of service in tho Confederate
army. Governor Stoneman set the exam
ple of appointing an ex-Confederete sol
dier when # he named for his chief of staff
Colonel Cosby. At one time Fitzgerald
and Burns were the closest of friends, but
a disagreement occurred which separated
them. Time works such wonders in heal
ing political wounds that these two na
tive sons of Mississippi may yet clasp
hands under Gage's benediction.
The office of Commissioner of Highways
is classed as a fat, juicy plum. The sea
son has brought forth many aspirants for
the fruit. A. C. Maude of Southern Cali
fornia, who engineered the original
scheme for the creation of the bureau by
an act of the Legislature, is in the field
as an active candidate for Commissioner.
He was in Sacramento when the Legisla
ture convened early In January
and remained there for quite a
length of time. It is said that
he has the indorsement of many
members of the Legislature for the Job.
Senator Bulla was his friend and per
suaded many of the Senators to sign the
petition commending Maude to the Gov
ernor. This incident did not escape the
observation of the "organization." which
was there doing active work to promote
the Senatorial aspirations of Burns. In
seeking for aid and sympathy in a cru
sade for the spoils of office Bulla's friends
cannot wisely look to Colonel Burns.
Somehow Bulla refuses to worship at the
Candelarian shrine, and the colonel be
lieves that Buila represents an ungrateful

section of the State. At a stormy inter
view which took place during the recent.
session of the Legislature Burns wanted
Bulla's support. In fact he needed it at
that particular time because all the touts
from Dibbie down had been declaring that
the Bulla men were only Bulla on the
surface and that wav down Inside they
were for Burns. Bulla essayed t" argue
the point with Burns that Southern Call- !
fornia was entitled to the Senator, and j
thereupon the colonel launcher! the curse
of the machine on Bulla. "Have T not,"
said the boss of the machine, "given
Southern California a Governor, yes. I
have given your section of the State two
Governors."
The argument which failed to convince
Bulla did ultimately convince Miller, as '
the latter, through a sense of sectional ,
gratitude or something else, voted for the '
Candelarian. So the sin of political in- i
gratitude cannot be charged to all the }
people of Southern California.
There is another leadingcandidate for the j
office of Highway Commissioner in the
field. The same is George W. Elder of San i
Francisco. He was kept busy in Sacra- j
mento looking after his political fences, i
and if the length of his petition is in |
harmony with his zeal in pursuit of the '
office it must be a mile long. The Gov- j
ernor Is fully informed as to Mr. Elder's
qualifications for the office, because. Mr.
Elder is the Governor's informant. As i
there are many other applicants for the j
place, all possessing the statutory re- |
quirements respecting ability as to engi
neering, neither Maude nor Elder may
get the coveted job.
This week the Governor may select '
three Commissioners for the Paris Expo- j
sition. It is common talk that Ben C.
Truman of Los Angeles, AY. H. Mills of i
San Francisco and Mark L. McDonald of j
Santa Rosa will be commissioned. Pre- '
dictions regarding these appointments are !
vast and varied. Mark McDonald was at ]
Sacramento looking after the billet, and j
the story goes that the Governor entÂ»>r- '
tamed and expressed appreciation of the I
applicant's ability. It is called to mind â 
that Mark L. is no stranger in Sacra
mento. He was there once as a central j
figure in a Senatorial contest that was a |
joy to all who participated excepting the !
one that gave the contest. Prior to his |
departure for Sacramento to enter into i
the joys and sorrows of the struggle he !
invested $40,000 in a primary election and i
another $40,000 or so in a daily paper j
called the Mall. Mark bought nearly all
the space in the two leading hotels of
Sacramento and opened wine all the day \
long and far into the night. Everything
went along well until Farley was elected i
Senator, and this happened because the
members who were elected and paid to
support McDonald were bought off in the
interest of his competitor. This Sena- j
tonal experience will in no sense dis
qualify Mr. McDonald from service as an
Exposition Commissioner. Since his de
feat for the Senate in the far away past
he has served as a World's Fair" Com
missioner and gained honors in the
service.
If Ben Truman and Mills are together ;
on the commission there may be a mon
key and a parrot time. When they were
employed in the literary department of i
the Southern Pacific Railroad they had !
many a collision. Truman was finally
forced out of the . company's service by
some unfriendly influence.
The talk that De Young has declined
to accept the position of Commissioner j
!s slightly discounted. It is thought that ;

SUNNYSIDE AVENUE.
Property-Owners and Residents Com
plain of Their Being Hfemmed
In by Unopened Streets.
Property owners and residents of Sun
nyslde, in addition to the other local ami
necessary Improvements asked by them
for their district, will urge the extension
of Sunnyside avenue from its present ter
mination to the Ingieside racetrack,
where It would join Dewey avenue. The
direct lino of this thoroughfare would run
through a portion of the Sutro land? lying
between the two given points. On the
southern end of this avenue there is only
a short section leading from th" .Southern
Pacilic Raliroad crossing to Islais avenue
to he connected with the Mission road. As
it is now the Sunnyside p< ople ary
hemmed in on both sides, with no way of
getting out except by Chenery street.
Heretofore this avenue of reaching their
homes from the business portion of thÂ©
city was all right in its way, but since
the San Francisco and San Bfateo Rail
road Company has put down a double car
track it leaves the roadway crowded, be
sides there is no way of reaching M
street without loss of time in getting
round by Randall street.
To obviate this the Sunnyside Improve
ment Club will urge the Supervisors to
open Sunnyside avenue from Mission road
to Dewey avenue at as early a period as
the funds of the treasury will Justify, and
in addition place a bridge over the rail
road track at Thirty-fourth and Miguel
streets.
The necessity of a school building in this
portion of the outlying district has been
forcibly presented to both the School Di
rectors and the Hoard of Supervisors by a
special committee appointed by the club
for that purpose. The people also want
electric lights and protection against fire.
At present insurance companies will take
no risks in that portion of the city. A
fire once started means the total destruc
tion of the property attacked. The peo
ple also want some attention bestowed on
the water riuestion ami the grading and
sldewalking of the streets within the dis
trict.

THE NEW STATUTE OF FRAUDS.
TO-DAY questions of statutory' construction fall
; ::d fast on the aching heads of newspaper
prietors throughout the State. To-morrow
all articles reflecting upon the dead or assailing the
living are to be signed, in each instance, "by the
true name of the writer." This remarkable specimen
of legislation by which it is proposed to undo the
magni? â  ''le freedom of the press
toward the close of the last century is a joint produc
[ well-known corruptionists, egged on by the
railroad and indorsed by the present Governor. The
estimate of the statute by Governor Gage was tersely
\ hen, in a published interview at Los An
geles, he treated the bare suggestion that he intended
to enter the newspaper business as absurd, for the rea
son that he had signed it, together with the anti
â¢ bill.
:onfessed that the object of this conspir
acy between the legislative and executive departments
of the State government is to gag the press. Like
all similar efforts, it will miserably fail. The breaches
of the constitution to which Grove L. Johnson, Sena
tor Morehonse. Governor Gage and other stung and
sore victims of just criticism were parties have been
already pointed out, and in due time will probably
arrest judicial attention. But it would be amazing, if
purblindness were not an inherent attribute of
malignity, that these astute and aspiring lawyers
I have produced so many questions of interpre
tation. Among them the most difficult to solve is
the meaning of the phrase, "the true name of the
writer." Within the language of the statute a con
stantly recurring question will be, Who is the writer â
the man who composes an article or the copyist? A
local article, tending to blacken the memory of the
dead or to disparage the living, may be the product
of three or four different minds. Their contributions
may have consisted of suggestions so interblended
that it is impossible to segregate them. The language
through which the suggestions are expressed may
have been selected by a person or persons who fur
nished none of the ideas. The words may have been
dictated to an amenuensis. Now, under these condi
tions, which are practical and could be infinitely
varied, who is the writer meant by the statute? We
are free to confess that to the ordinary lay mind this
question seems an unanswerable conundrum. But
more difficult problems can be suggested. Suppose,
for public reasons, that is, "from good motives and for
justifiable ends," it is deemed expedient by a newspa
per proprietor to republish the opinion of a court, in
which shameful misconduct has been imputed, for
example, to an aspirant for the Senate of the United
States. A reporter copies, or two or three reporters
copy, the opinion, or it may be that it is set up from
the volume in which it originally appeared. In this
case who is the writer? Was the opinion written by
the Judge or the bench of Judges who signed it or by
the copyist? Will some of the more learned pro
fessional tools of the railroad answer these ques
tions?
It is conceivable that, upon the grounds already
stated, it might be considered proper to publish a
judgment roll, including the finding and the decree
in a particular case, as, for instance, a suit in Los
Angeles that affects one of our highest State offi
cials. These papers are the composition of the law
yers, the clerk, the process servers and the court.
Who is the writer under the new law?
It might almost be wished that the act should be
operative for a brief period, so that the public might
have an opportunity, by actual examples, to test the
common sense and the legal ability of the legislators
whose agitated nerves and perturbed brains are re
sponsible for such a half-fledged abortion. Its
phraseology is unusually respectful to the dead. Are
Dan P.urns and his supporters included in this cate
gory or will the courts recognize the fact that phy
sically they survive?
Sacramento advices are to the effect that Dan
Burns and Hen Gage held a slate-writing seance last
Sunday in the Governors-o ffice. Portentous rap
pings of these two congenial spirits are said to have
filled with woe the hearts of numerous eavesdropping
job-chasers.
"There are no birds in last year's nest," quotes

JONATHAN AND JOHN-
*~pHE co-operation in actual war of Englishmen
and Americans at Samoa raises a series of very
* interesting speculations. The ambuscaded
force that was led jointly by an American and a Brit
ish lieutenant was the first allied military organiza
tion of the two countries that has marched and fought
side by side for seven score years. The two lieuten
ants fell together and died side by side, ambushed, as
Braddock was. When their bodies were recovered
the two flags were at half-mast, and the volley over
the dead rattled from the guns of each nation in a
mingled chorus that may echo around the world, in
the track of that shot fired by embattled farmers at
Lexington. The world looks on the scene at Samoa,
and the sober-minded peer into the future for its re
mote meaning. It brings the impression of the
stability of issues, the permanence of national lines
and the fixity of national genius.
About one hundred and forty years ago the policy
of the elder Pitt had matured. Shortly after the ac
cession of George 111 Pitt became aware of the
"family compact" between the Bourbons of France
and Spain, and favored immediate war on Spain and
perpetuation of the Prussian alliance by continuing
the subsidy to Frederick the Great. When his policy
was questioned in the Ministerial Council he declared
his purpose to conquer America in Germany. This
meant that the Prussian alliance was necessary to
enable Great Britain to expel France and Spain from
this hemisphere. The Council, led by Bute, defeated
Pitt's purpose and he retired from the Ministry.
Almost immediately his enemies found it necessary
to begin and carry out his policy, but in doing so
violated his purpose as to Prussia and made an
enemy of an ally. To the war which followed the
American colonies contributed 25.000 soldiers, and
equipped, clothed and paid them. Americans,
among them General Israel Putnam, were at the long
siege and final capture of Havana, The French were
expelled from Canada and the banished Acadians
were scattered. Thirteen thousand of them went to
French Guiana and perished miserably of tropical
diseases, thousands of them dying on DeviPs Island,
where Dreyfus is now a prisoner. When the war
ended England had taken the Canadas, including all
the country north of Ohio. The name of the French
post, Fort Duquesne, had been changed to Pittsburg
in honor of the British statesman whose policy had
prevailed, and the British flag floated over Cuba, the
Philippines, Martinique, Tobago, Dominica, St. Vin
cent, Granada and Minorca. So, a hundred or two
score years ago Americans and British were under
arms together in a war that had in large part the
same objectives as our recent war with Spain, and
against the same enemy we have just now overcome.
When our Revolution began in denial of the right
of taxation without representation, and it became
necessary to hold France in check, George 111 sought
a renewal of the Prussian alliance, but Frederick had
by that time learned to go it alone, and took occa
sion to resent his desertion by Lord Bute by curtly
refusing the overture.
Pitt said he would conquer America in Germany.
England probably lost America in Germany by Bute's
lack of foresight, for, with Frederick as an ally of
England, France could not have spared the fleet
and army which turned the scale and gained for the
colonies victory.
At Samoa John and Jonathan stood side by side
fighting against the policy, the purpose and the na
tive allies of the King of Prussia and Emperor of
Germany, the descendant of Frederick.
The end there is not yet. Xo eye can see far enough
into the future to discern what gains and losses, far
from Samoa, may come from what has happened
there. If war is finally lighted by the fire of Ameri
can and English guns at a common foe, the union of
action between the two nations at Apia will logically
and necessarily continue to the end. With both
against Germany why may not the French dream of
retaking Alsace and Lorraine be realized, and our
Revolutionary ally be rewarded for the gift of
Rochambeau's army and De Grasses fleet through
an alliance with our ancient enemy, which would pun
ish Germany for not holding France in check in 1780
to permit England to defeat our Revolution?
It is an alluring play in history that would punish
Germany for not standing as an ally of Great Britain
against us and reward France for standing as our
ally against Great Britain. The scene includes all
the parties to Pitt's great war, and may mark the
close of an epoch in the history of a race. The centri
fugal force which disintegrated the Anglo-Saxon race
was generated in Grenville's stamp act and proposi
tion to tax Americans without representation. It has
continued in the self-sufficiency of the actual Anglo-
Saxon colonies of Great Britain, for the Canadas,
Australia and New Zealand have assisted the mother
country more by expressions of loyalty than enlist
ment of troops. But the English and American blood
shed in Samoa had not dried in the tropical sun be
fore New Zealand offered assistance to Great Britain
and no doubt set going a sentiment which will spread
through the Australian colonies. The centrifugal
force is spent. Integration of a widespread race
seems to have begun. Where will it lead?
THE TAX SHIRKER'S WRIGGLE.
THE wriggle resorted to by Wells, Fargo & Co.'s
Express Company to escape paying its share of
war taxes exceeds in picturesqueness the twist
ing of the longest and most experienced reptile that
ever played a menagerie star engagement. This
corporation has been beaten in every case so far
brought against it to enforce the law, and it has
been condemned almost unanimously in the court of
public opinion. Not only this, but the point for
which it contends has been decided against it by the
Supreme Courts of several States and one or two
United States Courts.
The law says plainly that express companies shall
stamp their receipts and bills of lading before issuing
them. But these conscienceless corporations through
out the country refuse to do so on purely technical
grounds. An alleged ambiguity in the law has
enabled them to evade bearing their share of the taxa
ttion resulting from the Spanish-Xmerican war.
In this city the wriggle resorted to has degenerated
into a mere trifling with the processes of justice. It
was noted the other day in our local columns that
Wells, Fargo & Co., after being fairly defeated on
jurisdictional points in the United States Circuit
Court, has again caused a case against it to be carried
to that tribunal by writ of certiorari. The issuance
of this writ and the consequent delay can serve no
purpose except to make sport of the United States
Circuit Court. Judge Morrow decided in the Benham
case that he had no jurisdiction to consider the ques
tion as raised in that litigation. Taking the same
case again before him by writ of certiorari can only
result in compelling him to reaffirm his former judg
ment.
The contumacious corporation which is ordering
its attorney to thus travesty justice knows very well
that it ought to pay its war taxes. But under the
leadership of President Valentine it is forcing delay
ftitcr delay, not, perhaps, in the hope that ultimately.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1899.
the United States Supreme Court will decide the
question in its favor, but for the purpose of saving
as much in war taxes as possible. Every month
during which this corporation succeeds in preventing
a decision against it by a court of last resort in this
State it forces upon the people the payment of be
tween $8000 'and $10,000 which it owes the Govern
ment..
What ought to be done with Wells, Fargo & Co.
is to boycott it. Its resistance to law, to reason and
to common decency is becoming a painful scandal.
Its course in this matter has been unpatriotic and
despicable.
"ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STRONG.'.
THE CALL, while regretting what is demon
strated to have been the unnecessary outbreak
of hostilities between our troops and the Fili
pinos at Manila, has recognized the necessity of de
fensive measures and has done what it could to in
duce the country to provide such measures in the
ample form required by the situation.
It is not our fault that those who should have
counted the cost of American policy toward the
Filipinos failed to do so. That policy proceeded
rapidly from neglect to exasperation, and the conse
quences are upon us.
General Lawton has made a fruitless expedition,
exhaustive of military energy and resources, to the
south of Manila, protected by gunboats on the La
puna de Bai, and has been compelled to retire and
surrender to the natives the country he conquested.
He found the same problem that is worrying the
military wits of Otis and Mac Arthur, in the swarm
ing numbers of the Filipinos and their matchless ca
pacity for the quick and covert movements of guer
rilla warfare. It is perfectly plain to any one who has
followed military events in Luzon since the 4th of
February that no more permanent results have been
accomplished there than may be attained by drawing
your hand through water. No furrow is left in the
iiuid, which closes in as the obstruction passes. So
the swarms of natives close in behind our regiments
as they march and are ready to ambush and fight
them as they countermarch. With the merciless
torch we have planted desolation where stood the
peaceful homes of those people, but they have seemed
to spring out of the ashes of their huts, gun in hand,
ready to fight again.
Lawton gave it up, and returning to Manila said:
"With the forces I have I could go through the
whole island, but if a government is to be established
it will be necessary to garrison all the towns. It
would take 100,000 men to pacify the islands. I re
gret the necessity of abandoning the captured ter
ritory."
Long ago we warned the imperialists that, having
roused Filipino resentment by indiscriminate
slaughter, there would be no safety in the islands out
side of the garrison posts, and that any relaxation
of military vigilance would be followed by uprisings
and massacres. We have roused a native hatred more
bitter than that against Spain, for she never prom
ised independence nor justified a hope of self-govern
ment. We did, and have followed bitter disappoint
ment with a slaughter in two months of more ghastly
proportions than Spain was guilty of in two cen
turies.
It is worth while to follow Lawton's frank regret
at the necessity of abandoning the territory he had
captured by reading the evident afterthought of the
War Department at Washington. The acting ad
jutant general is quoted as saying that Lawton's ex
pedition accomplished its purpose, which was to dis
tribute "dodgers" on which the proclamation of the
American Commissioners was printed. The depart
ment adds: "Considerable difficulty has been ex
perienced by the commission in acquainting the na
tives of the kindly intentions of this Government."
Therefore Lawton was sent with gunboats and regi
ments, shelling and shooting as they went, "to spread
broadcast the recent proclamation of the Philippine
Commission, and before his departure he was given
careful instructions as to the line of conduct he
should pursue, and he has evidently carried them
out in a satisfactory manner." Then why does Law
ton regret the necessity of abandoning the captured
territory, if he was not sent out to capture it, but
went merely as a bill-sticker?
This evident afterthought of the War Department
will deceive nobody. The adventure in the Philip
pines has developed a wretched situation. The equal
izing effects of disease and the climate, upon which
The Call has ceaselessly insisted, have not been reck
oned with by our Government. The list of dead, wound
ed and sick American soldiers in that tropical climate
lengthens day by day. They are martyrs to a funda
mental error committed at home, to the sap-pated
enthusiasm of imperialism and the misleading of pul
pit, press and politicians. With the history of the
South Sea bubble and Law's Mississippi scheme be
fore us we have paid $20,000,000 for the same old
gold brick, and the 100,000 men required to hold it
will cost us $200,000,000 a year.
If things continue as they are tending now it is the
plain duty of the President to call Congress together
and consult the representatives of the people. The
costly measures now in action are not within the
executive scope. The war with Spain is officially
finished; it began by the Congressional declaration
of war. But without any such declaration we are in
a war that is costing ten times as much in lives and
money. It cannot go on much longer without seek
ing council with the people.
The statement from Washington that General
Lawton's expedition from Manila was designed, not
to subdue the Filipinos, but "to spread broadcast
throughout the territory traversed by the American
troops copies of the proclamation issued by the
Philippine Commission several weeks ago," throws
a new light on the subject. The press has been treat
ing the General as a soldier, but the Government
seems to have regarded him as general bill-poster.
The Chief of the New York Fire Department says
the only moral to be drawn from the destruction of
the Windsor Hotel and the Andrews mansion is that
heavy draperies about windows are dangerdus and
ought to be suppressed. If you wish to prevent peo
ple from seeing into your parlors pull down the
blinds.
Now that another legislative committee is investi
gating the Tammany administration of New York
City, it is worth while for some antiquarian to dig
over the political graveyard of the State and find out
where that old Lexow Committee is buried and what
sort of epitaph is written on the tomb.
As the Earl of Dunraven has just been elected a
member of the Limerick Council, it is evident he is
still capable of making a winning race in Irish poli
tics, but it is safe to say he won't try yacht-racing
any more.
As General Alger will not resign, nor General
Miles retire, the beef inquiry board will have to make
a very straight and narrow report if they wish it to
pass without hitting somebody in authority*

Company, a corporation, be and is hereby
granted the privilege to erect and maintain
poles and posts along and upon the public
streets and thoroughfares of the City and
County of San Francisco outside of the lire
limits of said city and county (except ui*on
Van Ness avenue) for the purpose of placing
electric wires and lights thereon, provided said
poles or post 3 shall be placed to the entire sat
isfaction of the superintendent of the Fire
Alarm and Police Telegraph, and under 'his su
pervision and subject to such use by said su
j"-rintendent for tie wires of his department as
shall be fitting and proper and the streets and
thoroughfares where the same are erected shall
be left in good order and condition to the satis
faction of the Superintendent of Public- Streets,
Highways and Square* ot the City and County
of San Francisco; also that the Independent
Light and Power Company shall have the right
to and is hereby granted the privilege to use
tall poles erected by the Mutual Kleetric Com
pany up. in payment of a proportionate amount
of the cost oÂ£ erection and maintenance of
said poles, and to erect poles In other portions
of the city and county outside the Ore limits
(except Van Ness avenue) where no poles of
said Mutual Electric Light Company are erect
ed; provided that these privileges shall not be
deemed to be granted for a longer period than
allowed by law.

The business of fixing the rates to be
paid by consumers for gas was to have
come up before the board at its session,
but by unanimous consent everything
pertaining to the matter was postponed
until the next meeting in order that the
matter may be more fully investigated
before Jinal action is taken. The Street
Lights Committee Is to hold a special
meeting for this purpose at 11 o'clock
this morning, and at the suggestion of the
Mayor all of the members of the board
have been Invited to bÂ« present.
As a preliminary measure to institute
proceedings that have been agreed upon
in regard to the calling of a special elec
tion to submit to the people the .propo
sition of voting a bond issue for the ex
tension of the park panhandle and the
institution of other public improvements
the following resolution was adopted:
Whereas, The Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs was heard by the Committee
on Streets Wharves, etc.. as to the necessity
of school buildings in the respective au>i.
in the soutnern portion of the city and county;
Whereas, It arrears that the school build
ings petitioned for are a necessity being for
the convenience and education of 'the children
In these outlying districts; and
Whereas, Under the municipal indebtedness
act (section 4) it Is necessary to obtain plans
and estimates of the cost of said buildings In
order to enable this board under section 4 of
the municipal indebtedness act to call a special
election and submit the question of a bond
issue with the total amount of the bonds re
quired: therefore
Resolved That the Board of Education be
and is hereby empowered and requested to have
their architect prepare plans for new school
buildings for the outlying districts and in the
City and county where required, and furnish
this board with the estimate of the construc
tion of each building and furnishing the sun..
with tho agpreKate amount for the erection and
furnishing of the buildings to be dcsi K nated to

determination.
Bl AIOELTINGER, Chairman*
In pursuance with the recommendation
of the Committee on Streets the board
passed to print a resolution appointing a
] board of appraisers to appraise the real
I estate and improvements proposed to be
acquired by the city for the extension of
the Panhandle. The board consists of G
H. Umbsen, J. R. Howell, Henry C. Rob
inson, A. J. RaJseh and S. H. Kent.
Mr. ITumbsen is named as chairman of
the board of appraisers and will act with
J. R. Howell in appraising tho value of
real estate. The other gentlemen named
will appraise the value of improvements.
The board is required to complete its re
port within thirty days of the day of Its
appointment, or as soon then-after as
may bo practicable. The resolution fixes
the compensation of each appraiser at
$500 and authorizes the. employment of a
; stenographer and necessary clerical help
On motion of Supervisor Perrault the
rules were suspended and a resolution
adopted providing for tho calling of the
roll of members arranged in alphabetical
order. Aigeiunger. Attrldge and Hoiiand
voted against the resolution.
The committee on street lights reported
recommending the postponement of ac
tion on the propnp^d resolution llxing the
rate to be charged consumers for gas
The report stated that the matter was
Btill under consideration by the commit
tee, this morning having been fixed upon
as the time for giving a hearing to rep
resentatives of the gas companies, who
wish to present arguments why the' pres
ent rate of $1 75 per thousand feet should
not be reduced.
Supervisor Perrault introduced a resolu
tion, which was defeated, requiring the
architects of the Hall of Justice building
to report to the board in writing any pro
posed changes in the building and the
cost of same before any action as to such
proposed changed are passed upon uv the
board. J
A resolution was adopted appointing
Thomas Sheehan engineer at the Fourth
street drawbridge at a salary of $100
a month. His hours of duty are fixed
at from S o'clock in the evening until 6
o'clock in the morning. This arrangement
will provide a tender for the bridge all of
the time during the twenty-four hours
and will meet the protest recently made
by shipping men as to charges made for
opening the draw after 0 o clock in the
evening.
Bids were received for the erection of
the new Mission police station from the
following persons and for thÂ« amounts
set opposite their names: Plumbing and
Gas Fittingâ Joseph McCutchen. $4fi43-
John J. McGowan, $3000; Allen M. Lrtninc
$3f>75: J. D. Welch, $4220; William s"

Thomas Butler, $34,875: Williams Brns.',
$34,450; McCann Bros., $35,000; James Fen
nell, $34,770. Referred to the Public Build-
Ings Committee.
The motion to reconsider the vote by
which the resolution giving the Mutual
Electric Light Company permission to
light public buildings at six cents per
light per night was defeated three weeks
ago came up and was lost, the Mayor
casting the deciding vote. The same rate
awaited the motion to reconsider the vote
by which the Mutual Electric Light Com
pany was refused the right to erect poles
on the public streets.
The motion to reconsider the vote by
which the November and December gas
bills were ordered paid at the rate of
$175 per 1000 feet was lost. The vote
stood: Ayesâ Byington, Deasy, Heyer,
Perrault, Lackniann. Noesâ Algelnnger,
Attridge, Black, Collins, Holland, Kalben,
Phelps.
On recommendation of committee ac
tion on the proposed ordinance hxing tne
annual license fee of Incorporated atn
letic clubs at $DOOO was indefinitely post-
poned.
Supervisor Aigeltinger introduced a
resolution prohibiting the sprinkling or
throwing (if water on Btreeta paved with
bitumen. The reason given was that the
streets so paved were made slippery by
being sprinkled arid rendered dangerous
for horses. The resolution was passed
to print.
Something of a breeze was created by
an objection offered by Supervisor Per
rault to the opening of the bids that were
called for some tlmo ago for furnishing
the Hall of Justice. In support of his
objection he stated that in his opinion
the specifications prepared by the city s
architect were not so drawn as to per
mit the city reaping any advantage from
the competition of bidders. He also
thought that many of the things called
for in the furnished specifications were
more properly chargeable to the bund
ing account. He asked that the opening
of the bids be postponed for one week In
order to give members who wished to do
so an opportunity to investigate the mat
ter and ascertain the facts. A motion to
this effect was carried, Aigeltinger, At
tridge, Holland and Kalben voting no.
The follow ng resolution by Supervisor
Perrault was*, on motion of Phelps, in
definitely postponed, it being urged that
the proper time for the consideration of
such a proposition was when some defi
nite proposition was properly before the
board:
Resolved, That this board pledges Itself not
to accept the surrender of any railroad fran
chise during its term of office, so that as con
templated under the provisions of the new
charter the question of the surrender of or the
granting of any franchise shall in the public
Interests be governed and controlled by the pro
visions of said charter, which charter takes
effect on the first Monday after the first day
of January, 1900.
Supervisor Collins Introduced a resolu
tion permitting the proprietors of cours
ing parks within the city limits, to sell
pools on dog races. On motion of Per
rault it was referred to the City and
County Attorney with the request that
that official examine the resolution and
see if its provisions would nullify in any
way the provisions of the racetrack ordi
nance recently passed and which had the
effect of closing the Ingleside track.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1899.
INQUEST UPON
CORRIGAN'S NEW
MORGUE VICTIM
Why Patrick McDer
mott Drank Poison.
LOST HIS ALL ON 0..E RACE
PREFERRED A SUICIDE'S GRAVE
TO THE ALMSHOUSE.
Game to the Last, He Avoided His
Friends Who Had Expected to
Hear of His Good
Luck.
T';i trick McDermott, the latest Morpue
victim of Flimflam Corrlgan, the Death's
H' ;il and Cross Bones of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, was the subject of a
Coroner's inquest yesterday.
Poor McDermott had passed the three
score years and ten reputed to be the
lot of man. In his old age he found him
self out of employment and as his meager
savings out of his meager earnings began
to melt away he made up his mind, as
he had clone often before, to stake his
last f<w dollars on the races. So he went
to Oakland last Friday and was taken in
hand by one of Corrigan's touts, who
picked out for him a quod horse, but
one not slated to win by the Corrigan
eurjis of bunko operators.
MeDermott's horse waa behind at the
start, and then steadily gained on the
six ahead of him. He was third at the
half mile, having worked his way up
three places; at the three-quarters he
was second and driving the lewd horse at
a fast utvl furious gait. McDermott stmid
t'> win $100 on an investment of $20 and
those who saw the old man at that stage
<>i" the race say that lie threw his hat into
the air and shouted himself hoarse with
joy.
Then the horse that the gamblers had
put up to win forged ahead from fourth
place and poor McDermott'- hopes were
battered to death with every clatter of
the hoofs.
Sick at heart the old man returned, but
he wore an aspect of gayety. Although
he had not a dollar tn the world ami the
prospect of the almahouse before him he
was game to the last. He smiled in the
faces of his acquaintances and told them
that the horse upon which he had wagered
his all on a confidential tip had lost. But
lie avoided his most intimate friends, went
to the stable at s;Â»0 Bryant street, swal
lowed a potion of carbolic acid and lay
down To die.
James Brady, a teamster residing: at 3'H>
Seventh street, saw McDermott to the
Oakland ferry boat and parted from him
after wishing him good luck. On Friday
evening he visited McDcrmott's usual
haunts for the purpose of inquiring as
to his pood or ill fortune, but failed to
lind his friend. Suspecting that it was
another Corrigan case, he went to the
Btable at 7 o'clock on Saturday morning
and found his friend dead.
Coroner Hill asked Brady whether he
had ever observed any Indications of un-
Iness of mind on the part of Mc-
Dermott, and Brady replied that he
never had.
Matthew Smith, a capitalist residing at
266 Page street, was called to testify as
' I'lrnwtts mental condition. He
testified that it was sound.
"One reason why I have asked this
question," said th.> Coroner, "is that the
papers have stated that McDermott was
playing the racÂ» b. a verdict of tempor
ary insanity should be brought in in the
case of any one who hucks the racop."
"I never bet a quarter on a horse race
in my life," protested Capitalist Smith.
That remark perhaps explains why
Matthew Smith is a capitalist.
The jury brought in a verdict of sui
cide.
A COURSING MATCH.
Motto's Owner Will Run His Charge
Against Mercy May if Grace
Will Judge.
For pome days past the topic of con
versation among le-ashm^n is the pro
posed match race between Motto and
Mercy -May. The flnjrs have already met
on the coursing sward, but it appears
that their respective owners will n<>t be
convinced as to which is the better dog
until the "flyers" meet in a contest of
besi two in three courses. The owner of
Motto is evidently willing to run his
charge provided that the owner of Mercy
May will consent to have the trial's
judged by John Grace, as the followiim
i'tt, r will attest:
MOUNTAIN VIEW, April 17. 1899.
Sporting Editor Callâ Dear Sir: There has
been so much fuss made over the proposed
Motto-Mercy May match race that all I win
ask you i.Â« to be. so kind as to publish the fol
lowing challenge in your valuable paper: I
will run my bitch Motto against Mercy May
for $100 or $500 In Union Park or In any other
park if John Grace will judge and James Grace
will slip. Every coursing man knows that
when there Is money up on a match race that
Mr Grace Is the only man in this country who
ran Five satisfaction, and all coursing men
know that the best flog will win. Now, If the
owner of Mercy May will leav* a deposit of
$100 In your hands I will meet Mr. Hobbs. the
owner of Mercy May, and make the match for
any day or any place he names. Those two
dogs met In the final at Union Park a few
weeks ago, and every coursing man present
thought that Motto won the course, but Judge
Bull Rave Mercy May the flair, hence the pro
poped match race. Hoping you will publish
this, I remain, yours sincerely,
FRANK H. McCOMBE.

Captain Dillon Prefers a Court-Mar
tial to Judge de Haven.
Captain John G. Dillon of the Govern
ment transport Morgan City, Indicted for
knocking down a Bailor on the high seas
with the butt cud of a Mauser rifle, ap
peared before United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday morning 1 and
asked to have his bail reduced from $1000
to $600. The court declined to grant the
request. Then counsel for the defendant
raised the point that as the offense was
alleged to have been committed on board
a Government transport the United States
courts had no jurisdiction and that the
offense, if any, was triable only before a
court martial. Â»
Argument on this point will be heard
this morning.

"SOCIETY IS CRYING
BEFORE IT IS HURT"
LITTLE EGYPT" is authority for the fact that the representative matrons
of the swell set are crying out long before they are hurt. Also that their
fears for the safety of their gilded masculine darlings are entirely
groundless, and if anybody is in need of protection it is she herself.
"Little Egypt's" claims to fame are based solely on the facts that the
diminutive danseuse was the cause of a sensational raid at the now famous
Seeley dinner and that she considers herself the only exponent of muscle
dancing in America.
"Egypt's" claim to the attention of the ultra fashionable set is based upon
the man3 r rumors that have been going around to the effect that the mascu
line pets of swell circles are seeking to emulate the famous Seeley and are
giving dinners at which "Little Egypt" is of even greater importance than the
wine that circulates and chet-rs.
Thus it comes to pass that morning sessions in dainty boudoirs are of daily
occurrence ami the discussions are of "suppression," coupled with the horrible
revelations a raid might engender.
"We must protect our innocent boys," say the matrons, "and oh, if there
Should be a raid and the poor fellows' names get into the papers, and if our
sweet, innocent girls should know" â
"Little Egypt," who is causing allthe worry, laughs at society's discom
fort and vows they are crying out before they are hurt.
"I have only been t<> one dinner," said "Little Egypt" yesterday, "and all
this talk is all bosh. If they want to got me to dance at their dinners it id go
rag ?>> coal them high, and 1 do not believe the dudes have the price. The
other day a society lady came to me and offered me $100 to dance at her din
ner. '1 only dance two minutes for JIM,' I told her. My price is $500, and
besides 1 have to know that I am dancing for the right kind of people, for
a girl in my position has to be careful where she goes.
"As for the society women trying to suppress me," the muscle dancer
continued, "that is ridiculous. Not a day goes by but I hear of society wo
men who are anxious to take dancing lessons of me. 'All right,' I say to
them, 'all right; I'm willing If you can prove your character and pay my
prieiV Further than that, they are all crazy to see me, and every evening the
boxes of the theaters where I dance are crowded with society women who, se
curely veiled, hide behind their box curtains and watch me dance."
"Little Egypt" is convinced that all the talk of dinners is the outcome of
jealousy, and that society ladles are hurt because she will not condescend to
meet them unless they can "prove their character."
As for the poor youths that the matrons and chaperons would protect,
"Little Egypt" only laughs at them. "Protect the boys?" she said. "If the
women would stop to think they would find it is I that need protection."
POLICE DEPARTMENT
GOES ON THE STAND
THE INGLESIDE CASE BEFOBE
JUDGE MUBASKY.
Ach Tries to Prove That Force Was
Committed and Business of Track
Was Injured by Police.
The case of the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club versus Lees came up before Judge
Murasky yesterday afternoon Garret
McEnerney and District Attorney Murphy,
the attorneys for the defendant, were un
able to be present, and in their absence
John A. Hosmer conducted the trial for
the defendant.
Henry Ach. attorney for the plaintiff
corporation, 'put a small army of gate
keepers and officers of the law on the
stand. He tried to draw out of all of
them that force had been committed in
effecting an entrance Into the racing park,
and that the diminution in attendance
consequent upon the interference of the
pullce was due to that very fact and not
because betting was prohibited.
All the high dignitaries of the Police
Department were given a chance to tes
tify and relate their part In the action
which resulted In the closing of the Ingle
side trn'k. Captains Wittman and Gll
len Chief I.ces. Officers Welch and Whe
lan and Sergeant Helms gave their testi
mony, whli-h agreed in the main that an
entrance was effected on the several days
without any violence. "Whelan testified
that when he attempted to enter the gate
Henry Ach was standing there, and that
the attorney said there would be no forci
ble opposition made to the entrance of
W. Uii but what he wanted was a test
case Ach denied having made any such
statement and went on the stand to dls-
Pln order to bring out the fact that the
falling off in attendance was Ale to tho
presence of the police on the grounds,
Ach .ailed Colin M. Smith, who readily
admitted that his only occupation was
that of being a capitalist; C. C. Hardy of
the California Wine Association and a
memb'T of the Olympic Club, and J. J.
Callunden. the superintendent of the.
Morse Detective Agency. Smith and
Hardy claimed not to be betting men,
but confessed to a love ror horseracing.
They said they would not go to the track
when it was ornamented by rows of po
licemen.
Charles Farson and Walter M. Tilton.
gate-keepers, recited how the police made
their entrance Into the Ingleside track.
Callunden was the last witness on the
stand, and the court adjourned after his
direct examination by Ach. The case was
then adjourned until this morning at 10
o'clock, when Hostner will begin his cross
examination of this witness.
SCENIC ROAD'S INNOVATION.
Time of the Evening Train Material
ly Shortened.
An Innovation on the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railroad was inaugurated
yesterday which will bring relief to the
through passengers on that line. Here
tofore train 18, which reaches San Fran
cisco at 6:20 p. m.. has stopped at every
little way station to take on milk, and
this constant stopping and consequent
delay have been a source of much an
noyance to the patrons. Yesterday this
was all changed, and now No. 16 comes
through from Petaluma with but three
stops and time has been shortened twenty
minutes from Ukiah, the train leaving
that point at 1:20 instead of 12:40 o'clock
as before. A special milk train runs from
Ignacio and relieves the regular passen
ger train of the burden. A special is also
fun from Tiburon to San Rafael ahead
of No. 0. which leaves at 3:30 p. m. This
change was necessitated by the greatly
increased travel over the scenic road dur
ing the summer and will be especially
pleasing to the devotees of golf who go
to the "links at Wagners.

half-past 3 o'clock, is the pastor of Sefton
Park Church In Liverpool, England, the
finest church In that city, and that Is con
stantly crowded hy one of the largest and
most influential congregations in all Eng
land. As a prearhor, as well as an au

He Is a speaker of extraordinary force
and clearness, and a man of great elo
quence and originality of thought. He is
the lntelkctu.nl attraction of Liverpool,
and Is even more successful as a render

It is certain that no man who has ever
visited this city has so charmed with his
rr ad ings as did Dr. Watson when he ap
peared at the California Theater a fort
night ago. Upon the occasion of this his

"Callfornian fruits are moving oft steadily,
tr.d prlr*>Â« remain firm," says the London Gro
cers" Gazette of the Ist inst. "The arrivals to
hand this week include the Duchalburn, with
12,.0 cases to London, and the Clan Graham to
Liverpool with 22.014 cases. There Is an active
demand but the greater portion were sold to
arrive. The stock of rlrst standards Is almost
exhausted. The approach of the holidays
caufced an early cessation of business in canned
fr-i-.iiU, but at the early part of the wfek there
was a rather more lively demand for salmon.
Prices have not advance.!, but ruling rates are
more readily paid by buyers than has been the
r-jLse recently. The arrivals . i ring the week In
rluue the Ourhalburn to Ixmdon with 73,001)

X A STERN MARKETS.
X MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 17.â A rise in call money
anil a recurrence of discrimination in loans
fttainst the Industrials caused prices to recede
below Saturday's close in th* afternoon trad
ing. The market, ns usuhl on Monday after
i. strong Saturday closing, opened active nd
str'>ne on an accumulation of outside orderÃ.
Except for a spurt ol strength in the Gran
gers,, with the Burlington leading, though
they subsequently l^st about all of their ear
lier gains, the dealings were largely confined
t<-> the industrials and specialties. Prominent
in the early strength were Tobacco, Iron and
Steel sharps. Anacondas, Cotton Oil and Gen
eral Electric. Tho latter was affected by gos
eip relative to dividend prospects. Uanhat
tÃn and Brooklyn Transit were consistently
\vak. although Brooklyn Transit recovered
somewhat from the lowest. Many of the ppe- ,
elaltles which had advanced must readily early
vrre equally conspicuous* In thÂ» afternoon de
cline, especially Continental Tobacco, Federal
Pteel, Colorado Fuel -.1 Iron and American
t-teel and Wire. An advance In wheat gave
encouragement to the bearc who construed It
us confirmatory of crop damage gossip. The
Ftrength in the call money market, which
ranged from 4% to 6, -â  as In a measure due
to i he financing of another crop of Industrial
combinations, including payments incidental to
the organization of- the American Hoop Com
pany. There was considerable selling for West
ern account in the atternoon trading which
pave encouragement to v large interest which
operated apparently on the short side. Lon
don was a purchaser of a number of dividend
lay Inc International securities and a seller of
H'L-culative low-grade â  tharr-s. Expectation
that the decision of the Rapid Transit Com
mission would be rendered thrs afternoon was
& smirie of strength to Metropolitan and weak
ness to Manhattan on the possibility that It
might favor the former. The gt-neral market
lett <â !Â¥ rather weak. Business in railway mort
gages was well distributed to-day and a gen
eral hich Tansc of prices was established. Total

count of the prevalence of warm, dry weather
started wheat firm. Private crop reports wer*
generally discouraging, but there were numer
j ous dispatches of the opposite sort which
I raised the hopes of the bears and caused heavy
j soiling on all the hard spots. May opened Â»Â»fi
I %c higher at 73c to 73'ic, touched 73'ic, then
i declined Irregularly to 73?ic. On a report from
j a prominent crop statistician confirmatory oi
, previous damage reports in the principal win
j ter wheat States the market recovered to 73% c.
i Renewed liquidation of May holdings quickly
! forwd a decline to 72Hc. Following that came
I gloomy reports from Miohigun and Indiana,

! with shorts covering freely. May rose to 73%@

J the premium over May being increased to %c.
Corn was strong on a decrease of 2,200,00 C

Some weeks ago Chief Fletcher decided {

would seriously impair the reputation of

This is from a letter from a prom-
inent business man, who volunteered
the advice about Grape-Nuts advertis-
ing-.
There is one especial reason why
Grape-Nuts are popular among men
who use their brains. The new food
does contain certain natural elements
that rebuild the gray matter in the
Drain, and a person can depend upon It
that after ten days' or two weeks' use
of Grape-Nuts, he will discover a
marked improvement in his mental
forces. This is not merely a claim, but
the statement is borne out by the an-
alysis of the food, and by the actual
experience of -those who use it. When
these facts are coupled with the really
remarkable and delicious flavor, one
can realize why It is the factory has
been running steadily night and day for
over five months and has been sadly
behind in filling orders.
said, his creditors have been looking for
him anxiously.
The story of Mr. Sachs' disappearance
is a. common one. He bought wine for
brunette ladies on a blonde intfoine ana
wasted what was left of his monthly pay
as salesman at making poor guesses on
the dogs at the coursing parks. Incident
ally he sandwiched in meteoric and dollar
marked flights through the tenderloin and
the denizens of that strict are his chief
est mourners. Sachs also took an oca
sional hand at cards and it is said that
a numb. of the cleverest dealers in town,
relying upon the high financial standing
of his uncle and employer, are out some
money on the credit they extended him.
The Sachs Brothers, by whom the ab
sent man was employed, deny that he was
short in his accounts. He was employed
only as a salesman and had nothing what
ever to do with the cash of the firm. They
make little of his alleged disappearance
and are inclined to think that it is sim
ply one phase of their nephew s ideas of
a good time. Â . â¢ .
Sachs has always been allowed great
latitude by his employers, by whom he
has been employed since he left college,
and taking advantage of this ha es
tablished for himself the. reputation of
one of the best things in the tenderloin.
He has not lived within his salary for the
past year, but the difference was made
up either by outstanding credits or hon
ored drafts" on his employers, and they
are Inclined to believe that their missing
clerk will report for duty again in a day
or so.

THE STORY OF THE
BIG CARDINAL AX
o o
O T~\ ERKKLKT, April 17.â A huge, blazing: bonfire, n hand, a big red ax, ROO <J
O r-\ college mon walking in lock step, a throng of co-eds on the bleachers, ft
q | J the wildest, kind of excitement, aperfect pandemonium of yells, cheers, ~
j hoots and howlsâ such, In outline, was the campus of the University of
O California this morning. O
O The ax occasioned It all. It was a Stanford ax, painted with a pood O
1 q thick coating of Stanford red. This was the ax captured at the baaeball game ft
last Saturday. o
** This morning shortly before the hour for drill the trophy was brought J?
O upon the cam] us under a strong guard of six-footers. Tt was like a call to Â©
.O arms. Instantly i . dressed In their cadet uniforms, came running O
q fmm all directions, Practically the whole university. Instructors and all, for- ft
( q Book their work to Join the mob around the cardinal's stolen mascot, sus- q
v pended aloft on a high pole. No one thought of drill. The ehout for a rally if
O went up and forthwith a rally was held. Â©
O The formalities were few and simple. Willing hands made short work of O
q board walks, freshmen dragged logs from a big lumber pile, boughs of trees O
q and tins of coal oil were added, and within less time than It takes to tell, a ft
I huge bonfire stood Ir. the middle, of the lower campus. if
jO Headed by the band, all the men, 800 strong, fell into one long line, and, Â°
! O walking in lockstep Single file, went up and down the campus, singing, cheer- Â©
! Q ing and yelling In a way wnich Berkeley has never before known in its his- O
i q tory. The procession ended by forming a ring around the bonfire, and there ft
*~ the whole crowd danced around the blazing pile, howling until their lungs ~
Â° could Ftand it no longer. It was an impressive exhibition, carried out on a
O large scale, and will be handed down as a tradition among Berkeley collegl- O
q ana for years to come. ft
California intends to hold to its stolen trophy. It is rumored that a spe- ft
Â° clnl officer of the Associated Students will be appointed, to be known as cus- X
! O todian of the ax. Accompanied by a strong bodyguard, it will be his duty to
; O carry it to field-days and football matches as an incentive to college rivalry. Â©
rt There are likely to be some lively scrimmages on such occasions if the Stan- O
*Z ford men try to take it away. ~
Th" cardinals made an attempt to recover their mascot by strategy this o
O afternoon. A shabbily dressed man on horseback called at the house In
' O which the ax is kept and presented the following note, purporting to have been Â©
;q written by Al Lean from the gymnasium: ft
O Sond by this fellow (a tall man) the ai to mÂ» this afternoon, for I want to rt
O number tt and fix handle. This fellow Is a painter. At. LEAN. â 
O The fellow was told to make himself scarce in a hurry, and a crowd of Â®
q men started in his pursuit. Ho heeded the warning and ' left in a hurry. Â©
q When Al Lean saw the note this evening he declared it a forgery, although O
!** his handwriting had been imitated remarkably well. The ax has been care- ft
Â° fully hidden, Its whereabouts being known to but one or two people. )l?

Set Apart for the Benefit of the
Hospital â Big Results
Expected.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 17.
After a consultation with Thomas A.
Williams Jr., of the Emeryville race
track, the lady managers of Fabiola
have agreed upon Saturday, April 29, as
Fabiola Day.
The ladies have discussed the advisa
bility of having a floral parade on that
day as in former years, and have arrived
;ii the conclusion that such a display is
undesirable. On past occasions there has
been much disappointment and not a llt
tlo unpleasantness provoked on account
of the disposition of prizes in the various
classes of rigs or in the matter of prece
dence in the procession. This year every
body will be at liberty to act independ
ently, and Fabiola Day will be literally
a go-as-you-j lease affair.
it is verj probable that tho display on
April 29 will be more generous than on
other occasions, for every one, it is ex-
Parted, will make some effort at decora
tion, and certainly the colors of Fabiola
will be lavishly used.
"The matter has been thoroughly dis
cussed," said Mrs. John Yll'.f>. president
of Fabiola Association, and we nave de
cided to center all our efforts upon in
creasing the attendance on Fabiola Day
and leaving all matters of decoration or
Horal display to the individual tastes of
our friends. , _
"We feel that no apology is needed for
accepting the generous offer of Mr. \\ l\
liams, nr.d we hope that Fabiola will re
ceive as greal a benefit from its annual
Derby Day as in past years. During the
past year there was some difference of
opinion regarding the propriety of
la Day at Emeryville, but we reel
assure. l that when a wounded or sirk
human being is having his sufferings al
leviated no <>ne stops to consider whether
the means by which such benefits are
made possible come from Mr. Williams or
somebody else."
As usual, an extra liberal purse will be
hung up for the Fabiola Derby, and
should the day be fine there will no doubt
i attendance, as Saturday
is always the most popular day at the
track. ' .

AFTER MANY YEARS
THE ACCIDENT CAME
DRUNK and sober, for twenty
live years Michael Weaver,
tanner, night after night stag
gered or walked along the
plank that bridged the big vats
in the Horn tannery at the cor
ner of Vermont and Army streets,
and never an accident befell him un
til last Sunday night.
Rendered careless by familiarity
with his narrow walk and the frown-
Ing vats of tan solution that yawned
beneath his feet and being in his
usual bedtime condition of hilarity, hf
lost his balance and fell.
"BUCK" DRAWS
CURTAINS AND
SHOWS HIS RAND
Fires His First Gun in
the Thirty- First.
DISTRICT CLUB ORGANIZED
THE BLIND BOSS PLOTS TO CON
TROL DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
His Henchmen Will Attempt to
Organize Powerful Clubs in
All Sections of the
City.
Chris Buckley, the deposed political
boss, has commenced to lay the founda
tion of a political structure upon which
he hopes to boost himself into power at
the coming camp;ugn. The firFt brick in
the flimsy structure was laid last night,
in the Thirty-first District, long since the
banner district of local Democracy, and
few of the unsuspecting citizens who
signed the roll contributing their mite to
"Buck's" power dreamed that they were
being passed a nicely handled gilded cube.
Ever ainco "Dickie" Doolan, who was
a candidate at the last election for Super
intendent of Streets, but who la "running
yet." and Charles Pomposity Gallagher,
who was dragged Into prominence by the
Committee of One Hundred, have been
manipulating the political affairs of the
district there has been more or less dis
satisfaction among the active workers of
the district, and the blind boss figrured
that the Thirty-first would be a star sec
tion in which to plant the first seeds of
his plot to control the approaching pri
mary.
Several of Buck's faithful lambs decided
to hold a meeting at Hibernia Hall on
Ninth street last Monday night, but when
they charged en masse on the hall direct
from Con Harrigan's corner and Alec
Greggains' saloon the Janitor refused to
allow them to meet there, because he
feared they would pack off the piano or
singe the leaves of the wreath around
the picture of St. Patrick.
They succeeded, however, In renting
Teutonla Hall, and the outfit met there
last night to go through the process of
organization.
Aiec Ureggains sent up a horde of
stutters from his disihict to boost Buck's
game along and they all had orders to
"land on" the first voter who attempted
to buck the programme. Ex-Senator Den
nis McCarthy was slated for chairman,
but as his everlasting devotion to Buckley
was well understood throughout the dis
trict the push came to the conclusion at.
the last moment that such a move would
be a trifle "raw," so Dennis was forced
to give way to another.
When the meeting was called to order
by Cass LeClare the word was passed
around that the powers that be had de
cided to elect Joe Keating chairman of
the organization. Keating, of course, held
a shotgun title to the job and was elected
without opposition. Then "Sprat" Mc-
Kenna nominated "Jack" Sullivan for sec
retary. Sullivan was also elected without
opposition and the organization from
which Buckley expects so much was com
plete.
There were many shrewd politicians in
the district who saw through the deal and
they refused to attend the meeting or
even allow their names to be usea to
foster the plans of the man from Liver
more. Many others who were inveigled

body of their fellow-workman sus
pended in the liquid.
Weaver was unmarried, a native of
Germany and 60 year? old. He was
an expert tanner, and, notwithstand
ing that he drank too much liquor on
Saturday and Sunday nights, he was
an industrious and valuable work
man. For a quarter of a century he
had slept in the second story of the
tannery and In order to pet to his
room he was obliged to walk the
plank over the vats. On such occa
sions he had his pipe in his mouth
and a lighted candle in his hand.
The body was taken to the Morgue.

that the purpose fpr which II was

of the Committee of One Hundred and Its

Ministers' Weekly Meetings.
Rev. Robert F. Coyle of Oakland read

by his brother ministers.
At the Methodist meeting Dr. John A.

years. The paper was an able one and
was favorably commented on by those

UNDER ARREST BUY
SILL CHANCE OF
ANY PUNISHMENT
INQUIRY INTO
THE RIOTIIG OF
SUNDAY NIGHT
But Little Result Ex
pected.
IT RESTS WITH THE MEN
REHFELD TO TRY TO IDENTIFY
THE OFFENDERS.
The Suspects Will All Be Paraded Be
fore Him To-Bayâ He Is Not
Sure of Even One of
the Mob.
A groo4 part of the garrison of the Pre
sidio is under arrest as a result of the
riot a.t the grates of the post Sunday even-
Ing. The arrest is only a constructive
one, however, for there is but one in
durance vile, and he is confined for the
row of Saturday night, and not for that
of Sunday; the other two hundred and
more have had their names and compa
nies taken down, and there the matter
will rent until they have all passed before
the owner of the ruined saloon so he may
Identify those he saw in the affray. They
will aJI have to tell where they were Sun
flay night, and if their answers be satis
factory they will have to be let go.
The investigation has been placed in the
hands of Lieutenant D. B. Devore, who
Js one nf tho officers in charge of the
laltien," troops enlisted into provis
ional companies and awaiting assignment
[es in the regiments now being
ted !:. foreign service. The casual
ties were the troops engaged in the affair
of Sunday night.
The investigation is not likely to be an
interesting one. There is no evidence
against the men except what Rehfeld. the
â ! m;in, can give, and at the time of
the assault on his place most of his ener
n securing safety for him
self instead of evidence for any investi
gation that might follow. The men who
were in the mob art- not known and they
will not come forward to identify them
selves, and there is but one sergeant who
stands a chance of being brought up to
any danger of detection. He is an infantry
sergeant Rehfeld saw in the crowd around
his saloon. The sergeant was not throw
ing any stones m>r was he making any
noise or trouble, but he was in the crowd,
and the saloon man thinks he can recog
nize him if he sees the man again. When
Rehfeld tries to give a description of the
sergeant, however, hischance of ever iden
tifying him seems to be dim and distant.
The officers themselves have very little
hope of ever bringing any one to trial for
mobbing the place. The casuals are all
new men and not one in five is known to
the commanders. They are arriving and
departing all the time and a personal ac
quaintance with the casuals under their
orders is neither necessary nor usual with
the officers over them, and even if It were
none of the offl on the ground
when the mob gathered to set fire to
Rehfeld's whisky barrels. The troopers
who finally restored order had no time to
ascertain just who were the. ones making
the trouble and of tho crowd finally gath
ered In there Is no way of separating the
from th>- goatsâ the good from the
badâ that is. unless some one confesses or
tells tales, and the soldiers will
do neith.r.
The process of arresting suspected sol
diers -without confining them is proceed
ing right along. Two men who had not
been spotted were placed on the list yes
terday and there were more to come, but
the Baloon la dcs til the men know
the game Is in their own hands, so arrests
are not dn
If caught there Is punishment and
enough to spare for those who were guil
ty. They will be turned over to the civil
authorities first and all the years of pris
on the law pn arson will prob
ably become theirs, besides collateral Ken
tences for malicious tnlschi* f, battery, as
sault to murder, threats to kiil and a
dozen other eh â¢ then when the
civil authorities have finished the. mili
tary authorities will form a court-mar
tial to heal the breach in discipline and
a term on Alcatraz will wind the thing
up.
The one man under arrest for the row
on Saturday night is William R. Clark.
He Is believed to be the one who struck
King and knocked him Insensible, and
he has been identified as the assailant by
two soldiers who were In the saloon at
the time. But to the officers who ques
tioned him he declared he knew nothing
of the row and could not imagine why
he had been arrested. King himself knows
nothing of thu row on Saturday night
ar.fl nothing of the subsequent events on
Sunday night. He in now In the hospital
nursing two black eyes, the finest speci
it Is reported, ihat have been ln
trorlu'^d to the institution, but no one is
allowed to see him. Of the others who
were in the fight Earl White is getting
along with the use of one eye, while he
. the other bandaged, and two or
more are rubbing sore spots with
arnica.
The one most injured is Behfeld. the
saloon man. He had $600 insurance on
the place, but he does not know whether
or not hia policy is good under the cir
cumstance of mob violence. So far as
his chanr-M? of securing redress from the
Government are concerned he is not
hopeful. The case will have to bo in
vestigated and reports will be made on
It for the next naif year, but in the
meantime he has a wife and six children
to care for and they can hardly afford to
await the work^igs of the court of
claims. He has no clear idea what he
will do about damages.
The Question of responsibility is a nice
one. The property was beyond the limits
of the reservation, but It was destroyed
by Government employee. The question of
punishment Is an easy one compared to
the one of redress. The civil authority i
la not disputed and the men will nave to 1
answer as criminals from civil life, but
who shall pay for the damage is not so
definite. So far the only offense the mili
tary authorities look upon with concern
ts the i.re.-M'h of discipline; the arson is
looked upon as a civil matter, and the
investigation now being carried on is
more in the nature of an assistance to
the civil authorities than to correct any
military offense committed. The police
will l>e called on to lend what aid they
can give in the case, but that will be but
little. The general opinion is that, un
less the aspect of the matter changes
considerably there will be no result.
Goldberg, the tailor, whose shop con
tributed to the blaze, lias moved his
stock to the Bidewalk across the street
and is already resuming business. Prince,
the barber. Is also looking around for an
other place for himself and his razors,
but Rehfeld is not so sure. He has not
yet decided whn f he will do; whether to
settle again within reach of the soldiers
or to go where soldiers are unknown ex
cept for purposes of war.
The neighborhood has resumed its
usual quiet and but for the burned shells
and the presence of three policemen in
stead of one there is no indication that
the locality is anything but the most
peaceful arid sober. The Fire Marshal
has also taken a look at things, but he,
too, is awaiting the action of the investi
gation by the military authorities. The
officers are -willing to do all in their
power, hut they expect hut little from
any examination of the men. In mobs
where every man is known it has b< en
the experience that no one is ever
caught, and, as one officer expressed it.
what better success can be expected in
this case..
WRIT OF PROHIBITION
SAVES E. C. KILPATRICK
JUDGE DAINGERFTELD GRANTS
TEMPORARY RESPITE,
Enjoins Board of Education From
Deposing the Principal of the
Business Evening School.
The Board of Education ran against a
pnag last night in the shape of an alter
nate writ of prohibition issued by Judge
r>aingerfield. prohibiting it from taking
any action against E. C Kilpatrlck, prin
cipal of the Business Evening School. A
special meeting of the board had been
called for the purpose of trying a number
of teachers charged with incompetency,
among them being Kilpatrick. Thf latter
was also accused of unprofessional con
duct and insubordination, and there is
little doubt but for the Issuance of
the writ he would have been summarily
deprived of his position. As it was, the
board was obliged to postpone action in
his case, and the matter went over until
next Monday night.
Judge Daingerfleld's action in issuing
the writ was based on the contention that
Kilpatrick having once been adjudged
guiltless of the charges preferred against
him he could not again be placed in jeop
ardy on identical charges. The writ is
returnable on April liv
Kilpatrick's troubles date from August,
isr<6, when charges similar to those men
tioned were preferred against him by Ger
aldine. G. Donovan and Walter S. Bran,
teachers In the Business Evening School.
Kilpatrick claimed that the charges wero
instigated by Directors Kagan and Galla
gher, and on recommendation of the
Rules Committee, to which they were re
ferred, they were dismissed. In Febru
ary, 1198, charges were again preferred
against the obnoxious principal by Ral
eigh P. Hooe, and the subsequent trial re
sulted in Kilpatrick being dismissed from
the department on March 23, 1&& S. He car
ried the case to the Superior Court, al
leging that he had not been accorded a
fair and impartial trial by reason of prej
udice on the part of a majority of the Di
rectors, who he claimed were in a con
spiracy to oust him from his position.
Judge Hunt on September 'it, lSi+S, de
cided in his favor and ordered him re
instated. The old board appealed from
this decision, but when the new board
came Into office the appeal was dismissed
and Kilpatrick was reinstated on Febru
ary 10 of this year, i-'resh charges were
almost immediately brought, however,
and these were supplemented on March 8
by charges preferred by Walter S. Bran,
and It was this batch of charges which
the board intended to take up last night.
The writ of prohibition took the board
completely by surprise, but the Directors
are confident that they will be sustained
when the case comes up for argument.
Kilpatrick is marked for decapitation,
and while he may put off the fatal day
by resorting to technicalities, his fate is
sealed.
Superintendent Webster announced that
of the other teachers who were charged
with ineompetency, some had resigned,
others had retired and others were un
able to be present on account of illness,
leaving but one teacher ready to stand
trial, Mrs. Emma Pool, a teacher in the
Haight primary, who desired that her
case be considered behind closed doors.
The request was granted and the board j
â went into committee of the whole, with i
Vice President Head in the chair. When
the board reconvened it was announced
that Mrs. Pool had been dismissed for
physical ineompetency with the under
standing that if within six months her
disability had been removed a petition
for reinstatement would be favorably
considered by the board.

Did Not Perform.
INJURED LITTLEWILLIE LYNCH
CHIEF LEES FAVORS THE SUS
PENDED OFFICER.
Collects Five Months' Salary, Al
though He Had Not Done
Any Duty for That
Time.
Police-man Frank Kenville enjoys the
peculiar distinction of having collected
$500â his salary for five monthsâ from the
city without having performed any police
duty for that period.
Kenville is the Individual who struck
little Willie Lynch with his club during a
prize fight at Woodward's Pavilion. The
unfortunate boy was standing near the
; entrance to the pavilion when Kenvllle,
! evidently anxious to make a record, threw
I his, club at him, striking him In the head
i and fracturing his skull. Although Ken
vllle emphatically denied that he had
thrown his club at his helpless victim,
there were several witnesses to the as
sault who positively identified him as the
officer who had wielded the locust. Satis
fled that Kenville was responsible for the
Injury to the boy, Captain Qillin, to whose
station he is attached, formally charged
him with an assault to commit murder
: and Kenville was at once suspended by
i Chief I,ees pending: the result of his trial
lin the Superior Court. That was tive
' months ago, and although Kenville has
not done any police duty during that
, period he has received the warrants for
his salary, which he did not earn, and
they were duly honored by the Treasurer.
The day after Kenville a trial in the
Superior Court, and which resulted in a
disagreement of the jury, Kenvllle was
I restorer! to duty by Chief Lees. He was
given his hack warrants and told to re
port to ( !aptain < Jillln.
The head of the department explains
the action by saying that notwlthstand
| ing Kenville had not performed po
! lice duty from the time or his suspension
until he was reinstated, he was still a
member of the police force and entitled
to draw his salary for the time that he
was relieved of his star.
Kenville hopes, with the aid of his
"pull." to induce the District Attorney
to withdraw the charge against him and
! thus avoid being tried again.
His unfortunate victim lias not entirely
recovered from the effects of the blow
at the hands of the infuriated policeman,
and it Is doubtful If he ever will. At
certain times, particularly when he gels
exicted, he swoons away. His pitiable
condition, so the surgeons who have in
terested themselves in his case say, is
due to the blow on the head.

MISS BURLING TO WED
THE OLYMPIA'S DOCTOR
THE swell social set experienced a
pleasant sensation yesterday
when it learned of the engage
ment of Miss Mamie Hurling and
Dr. John Evelyn Page of the Olym
pia.
The betrothal was supposed to be a
profound secret, the charming fiancee
having taken only a very few of her
very dear friends into her confidence,
but the Becret was too good to keep,
and the "little bird" who always
whispers of heart affaJrs noised the
interesting news abroad.
Miss Burling is the daughter of the
late William Burling and for a num
ber of years has beep one of the lead-
Ing belles In select circles. Hit many
charming qualities, together with her
magnetic personality, have endeared
to her hosts of friends. Miss Burling
comes of a family whose name is
closely identitied with the early com
mercial and social history of the
State. In early days William Burling
was a millionaire stockbroker whose
name was a power on the street.

Only a Question of
What District.
COMPANIES WILL CO-OPERATE
THEY CONFER WITH THE MER
CHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
A Week Hence the District and the
Time Within Which Work Must
Be Done Will Be
Fixed.
The directors of the Merchants' Associa
tion met yesterday with representatives of
the various lighting companies to discuss
the question as to what district electric
wires shall be placed under ground. This
is one of the matters affecting the wel
fare of the public which the association
has agreed to investigate and report-up
on to the Supervisors.
There was a unanimity of opinion at
the conference that the wires should
properly be placed under ground. The
representatives of the various companies
readily agreed to this. The looks of the
city's streets would be greatly improved
with the removal of unsightly poles and
the network of wires overhead. Chief
Sullivan is particularly anxious to do
away with the latter, as they always in
terfere with the proper working of the
Fire Department.
the discussion, which was participated
in by. men who have made the lighting
question a special study, hinged on two
pointsâ the district in which the Officers
of the city, shall order all wires under
ground and the time when the work shall
be completed. The representatives of the
various companies professed their eager
ness to have the wires under ground at
the earliest possible moment. The dis
trict in which this shall be done has not
as yet been defined. This is the only
point upon which there is any difference
uf opinion. Some believe the lines defin
ing tho present fire limits should be
adopted. Others hold this to be too wide,
embracing all the city north of Market
street and east of Stockton to the water
front and a strip two blocks In width
south of Market street from the bay to
Twelfth street.
This will be greatly modified. One of
the plans presented contemplates fixing a
district along certain geographical lines,
while the other plan embraces those
streets of the city that are most trav
eled. Those in attendance at the con
ference could not decide upon the exact
district to be covered and the length of
time in which the work should be don*.
It was determined to meet again on MorP"
day next, at which time the question
will be finally passed upon.
There were present at the conference
representatives of the Sunset Telephone
and Telegraph Company, Pacific Postal
Cable-Telegraph Company, Mutual Elec
tric Light Company and San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company, Superintend
ent Hewitt of the Fire Alarm and Police
Telegraph Department, and Chief Sulli
van of the Fire Department, as well as
President Dohrmann, Director Hale, Sec
retary Freud and Superintendent King,
of the Merchants' Association, were also
, present.

affair.
RAGTIME AND
COMEDY SKETCH
ORPHEUM HITS
Clarice Vance in Coon

ART OF LILLIAN BURKHART
THE RAYS OFFER THREE HOURS
OF WIHD FUN.
By Ashtnn Stevens.
The prophets were busy last season
promising us the death of the coon
song. All the "warm babies" and
"chocolate ladies" and the "hottest
coons in Dixie" were to pay the price
of over popularity with their lives. But
for all these gloomy forecasts the coon
sons still lives its reckless rag-time
life, lives it harder than ever. No
vaudeville show, no farce comedy is
complete without it. The adventures
of the colored tenderloin, told in synco
pation, have taken, a strong hold on the
people. Rag-time is more than a fad,
it is a fact. In its sportive pumpkin
colored way it has made an original
contribution to the folksong of Amer
ica. The text of most of these songs is
more or less "tough." Sung in the
white man's dialect it would be posi
tively objectionable in most cases; but
when couched in the flash nigger's
lingo even the frankest of the songs
seem to make a humorous and harmless
appeal to all sorts of people. The
secret of the charm of the modern
coon song is character. There is em
phatic character not only in the music,
but in the stories to which it is set.
I heard a strong specimen at the
Orpheum Sunday night when the new
bill was put on. It was sung by Clarice
Vano, a tall, angular, expressively vis
aged young woman with a voice just
made for rag-timeâ hard, loud and
faultless in articulation. The song is
called "Gimme Back Dem Clothes," and
tells of a dusky wench who won at
"craps" or "policy" and gave her man
the finest in the landâ everything from
silk hosiery to an 18-carat tooth. But
he was Indiscreet and they fell out and
this is the chorus she sings:
Gimme back dat overcoat I buyed yo",
Or.de papers will be full of rag-time
news;
Gimmf back dat fancy checkered vest,
Likewise dem socks and shoes;
Just hand mn over dat solid gold tooth
And take dem eyeglasses off-a yo 1 noseâ
Yo' been coon-rich, but you won't have a
stitch
When yo' hand me back dem clo'es.
Miss Vance sings this song and others
that are not so new with irresistible
emphasis and sideplay. She has the
value of the right word down to a
nicety; and her entire work is some
thing more than mere music hall sing
ingâit Is a sharp, clever study In char
acter.

with the exception of the one furnished
by Tom and Lily English, which is of
the instrumental-farcical order and
poorly executed. Al and Mamie Ander

several years ago, have returned with
practically the same act. They were
among the first of the rag-timers, but
have now fallen a bit behind in the
race for novelty. Favor and Sinclair

This week, as last, the most artistic
feature of the bill is Lillian Burkhart in
a short comedy. This one is named
"Extravagance." and the programme
candidly states that it is a farcical re
minder of "My Milliner's Bill," a little
piece memorable for its performance by
Roslna Yokes. "Extravagance" is
not notable for any of the delicacies and
fancies that marked Miss Burkhart's
fairy gem of last week; it is farce pure
and obvious, and naturally makes a
heavier dent in the appreciation c-f the
Orpheum-goers. The part of the
thoughtless, extravagant bride of
an embarrassed young stock broker
is worked out with considerable '
consistency and displays a charming I
phase .of Miss Burkhart's comedlc
power. She is the best actress that I
have ever seen in vaudeville. She has
grace, humor, a fine personal spell and
a voice that makes music of every line.
Come to think of it, in our present
plethora of comic opera and farce
comedy, Miss Burkhart at the Orphoum
is the only player in San Francisco
who may be reckoned with seriously. I
wish we might have hours- of her in
stead of minutes.

When It comes to "A Hot Old Time,"
with Johnnie and Emma Ray in it,
which commenced to burn at the Cali
fornia Theater last night, I throw up
my, hands. When a theaterful of ap
parently normal people laugh to the
shrieking point for three consecutive
acts there must be something funny in
the show. That is what the crowd did
last night. Thin people rattled and
fat people jellied with the force of their
own laughter. The title of the piece
was justified.
The Rays are the same old Johnny
and Emma, the most husky, steamful
team of breakneck vaudevlllalns in the
business. Even the offer of a reward
would not produce the plot in their farce
comedy. It is a whirlwind of horse
play, gag, dance, fight, song and shout.
Mr. Ray's Irishness is more potent than
ever. He does everything that he used
to do in his Orpheum act, and a great
deal besides. The only people in the
world who could make a go of this
show with its supporting company are
the Rays. And they do it.
Notice of the other theater* Is post
poned until to-morrow.
